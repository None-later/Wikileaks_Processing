REF: DJIBOUTI 00265 
 
1.  PRESIDENT ISMAIL OMAR GUELLEH ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 4 
THE APPOINTMENT OF DILEITA MOHAMED DILEITA AS PRIME 
MINISTER.  DILEITA IS AN AFAR, AND IS PRESENTLY 
DJIBOUTIAN AMBASSADOR TO ETHIOPIA.  THE PREVIOUS PRIME 
MINISTER, BARKAT GOURAD HAMADOU, RESIGNED FEBRUARY 6 
BECAUSE OF POOR HEALTH, REF A.  SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN 
1977 THE PRESIDENT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN AN ISSA AND 
THE PRIME MINISTER AN AFAR.  THERE IS SPECULATION, 
INCLUDING BY THE GOVERNMENT NEWS AGENCY, THAT 
DILEITA\'S APPOINTMENT IS THE BEGINNING OF A CABINET 
RESHUFFLE.  THE POSITION OF PRIME MINISTER IS LARGELY 
CEREMONIAL, WIELDING LITTLE POWER. 
 
2.  THE APPOINTMENT IS AN INTERESTING COMPROMISE, 
BECAUSE DILEITA IS NOT A PARTY MEMBER OF EITHER THE 
RULING RPP, OR THE OPPOSITION FRUD.  HE IS KNOWN TO BE 
CLOSE TO THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER.  MOST PEOPLE HAD 
PREDICTED THAT ONE OF THE PROMINENT AFARS IN THE RPP 
WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET WOULD GET THE NOD, SUCH 
AS ALI GUELLEH ABOUBAKER, PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF; 
MOHAMED DINI FARAH, MINISTER OF HEALTH; OR ALI MOHAMED 
DAOUD, MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE. 
 
3.  DILEITA MOHAMED DILEITA WAS BORN MARCH 12, 1958 IN 
TADJOURAH, DJIBOUTI TO AN INFLUENTIAL FAMILY.  HE WENT 
TO HIGH SCHOOL IN CAIRO, EGYPT AND RHEIMS, FRANCE, AND 
RECEIVED A DEGREE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS FROM A COLLEGE IN 
MEDEA, ALGERIA IN 1981.  THE NEXT YEAR HE BEGAN A 
DIPLOMATIC CAREER IN THE DJIBOUTIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY. 
BY 1985 HE HAD THE RANK OF EMBASSY COUNSELOR, BUT 
REMAINED IN DJIBOUTI.  IN 1986 HE TRAINED IN THE 
FRENCH MINISTRIES OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEVELOPMENT. 
IN 1988 HE BECAME DEPUTY HEAD OF PROTOCOL IN THE 
PRESIDENT\'S OFFICE.  IN 1993 HE BECAME COUNSELOR FOR 
CONSULAR AFFAIRS AT THE DJIBOUTAN EMBASSY IN PARIS, 
WHERE HE REMAINED UNTIL BEING APPOINTED AMBASSADOR TO 
ETHIOPIA IN 1996.  HE IS DIVORCED WITH ONE CHILD. 
 
4.  BARKAT, AGE 70, HAD BEEN PRIME MINISTER FOR 22 
YEARS.  FOLLOWING A STROKE MARCH 11, 2000, HE SPENT 
SIX MONTHS IN A PARIS HOSPITAL.  HE RETURNED TO 
DJIBOUTI OCTOBER 2, PARTLY PARALYZED.  MANY PEOPLE HAD 
THOUGHT THAT BARKAT\'S LEAVING THE JOB WAS AN OPENING 
FOR PROGRESS IN THE POWER-SHARING NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
THE FRUD.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED WING OF THE 
FRUD SIGNED A PEACE ACCORD FEBRUARY 7, 2000 THAT ENDED 
SIX YEARS OF OCCASIONALLY VIOLENT CLASHES, AND HAVE 
BEEN NEGOTIATING EVER SINCE.  THE ARMED WING OF THE 
FRUD IS LED BY AHMED DINI AHMED WHO SERVED BRIEFLY AS 
PRIME MINISTER JUST AFTER INDEPENDENCE.  THE 
NEGOTIATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN GOING WELL LATELY, AND IT 
WAS THOUGHT THAT THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP MIGHT BE A 
BARGAINING CHIP WITH THE FRUD. 
 
5.  THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME OUT 
OF THE COUNTRY RECENTLY.  HE HAS BEEN BACK IN DJIBOUTI 
FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING TRIPS TO KHARTOUM AND 
ASMARA, AND HE LEAVES FOR BEIJING IN THE NEXT COUPLE 
OF DAYS.  THE PRESIDENT DECIDED NOT TO ATTEND THE 
AFRICAN SUMMIT ON AFRICAN UNION IN SIRTE, LIBYA, 
APPARENTLY PREFERRING TO WORK ON DOMESTIC POLITICS. 
BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER\'S JOB IS LARGELY 
CEREMONIAL, IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT 
MISS THE SIRTE CONFERENCE JUST TO SELECT SOMEONE FOR 
THIS ONE POSITION, AND MORE CABINET CHANGES WILL BE 
MADE SOON.  HOWEVER, PREDICTING WHOLESALE CABINET 
CHANGES HAS BEEN POPULAR SPORT EVER SINCE ISMAIL OMAR 
GUELLEH CAME TO POWER IN APRIL 1999, YET THE ONLY 
CHANGE HE HAS MADE SO FAR IS TO NAME A NEW PRIME 
MINISTER.

Classified By: RSO MARC RAMOS FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) and (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Four people have been injured, two seriously, in three days of 
anti-war student demonstrations in Djibouti City. 
Two local students were seriously wounded when local police fired on 
demonstrators on March 24; they remain hospitalized.  In addition, two 
German soldiers were injured on the same day while driving by a 
demonstration by local university and high school students.   Although 
the demonstrators, virtually all students, reportedly have sought to 
march on the U.S. Embassy, local police have restricted them to the 
downtown area.  The demonstrations, occurring successively on March 23, 
24, and 25, have ranged in number from 100 to 600 people and have laste 
approximately 5 hours each day.  Local press coverage has included 
graphic visuals, perhaps inciting the demonstrators.  The extensive 
press coverage of the demonstrations themselves suggests that at least 
the first was government-sanctioned.  However, as the gatherings have 
continued, they have begun to take on a slight anti-government coloring 
 Local security officials expect demonstrations to continue, and perhap 
to become more violent, as U.S. forces approach Baghdad.  End Summary. 
 
STUDENT PROTESTS 
---------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  Four people, including two Djiboutian students and two 
German soldiers, have been injured in anti-war demonstrations occurring 
on the mornings of March 23, 24, and 25.  Local police have restricted 
the demonstrations to the downtown area, using riot control tactics and 
tear gas, although reports suggest that the protestors have sought to 
continue their protests at the U.S. Embassy. The students responded by 
throwing rocks at the police and vandalizing nearby vehicles.  On March 
24, police reportedly fired upon the crowd, injuring two students 
seriously.  The two remain hospitalized in serious condition. In 
addition, U.S. military personnel received a report that two uniformed 
German soldiers were injured as they drove by one of the demonstrations 
in a German military vehicle. 
 
3.  (C) Students report that the initial demonstrations of March 23 
were the direct result of bulletins posted on the university and high 
school campuses. Students deny that they posted the bulletins themselve 
or of having knowledge of who did so.  Senior FSNs, however, report tha 
they have heard reports that local security forces posted the bulletins 
 Opposition unionist and high school teacher Souleiman Djama told ConOf 
that he witnessed clandestine state security personnel posting bulletin 
announcing demonstrations at a local high school. In a conversation wit 
Conoff, Abdirazak Hassan Guedi, the judiciary council to the Minister o 
the Interior, denied these claims, calling them rumor. Security 
field reports indicate that the demonstrations were incited by local 
Muslim clerics. 
 
MEDIA 
----- 
 
4.  (U) The state-run newspaper \"La Nation\" gave front page coverage to 
the first of the demonstrations on March 23.  The front page photo in 
the March 24th edition pictured marching students waving Iraqi flags an 
anti-war banners.  The opening line of the adjoining article read... 
\"Felt to be unjust and unjustified, the war against Iraq has provoked a 
general outcry in the entire world.\"  A second cover article on 
the same day titled \"The war of images\" spoke to the graphic nature of 
the television coverage of the war.  The article specifically addressed 
Al-Jazeera pieces, noting that \"The war against Iraq is not as clean as 
we might imagine. Despite the precision of their high technology, smart 
bombs have caused numerous civilian casualties, the number of which can 
only rise after every attack.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C) The fact that the demonstrations were covered in the state-run 
newspaper and television suggests that at least the first demonstration 
was government- sanctioned.  Djibouti is the only Arab League country 
not to experience immediate anti-war demonstrations; thus, it is likely 
that the President believed it necessary to demonstrate popular 
opposition to the war prior to the March 24 Arab League meeting in 
Cairo.  The President made his first critical public statement on March 
24, likely to boost his position in Cairo. He opposes the war in Iraq 
even though he believes there should be regime change, but he 
fears that demonstrations of any kind will also become anti-government 
because of the poor state of the Djiboutian economy. 
 
6.  (C) The most recent demonstration on March 25th was accompanied 
by a police escort and conducted in a peaceable manner; however, the 
most recent gatherings have begun to take on an anti-government cast. 
 Embassy personnel and U.S. military continue to monitor the situation 
around town; all agree that this is only the beginning of what is 
believed will be many more demonstrations to come. Embassy security 
contacts have suggested that, due to the graphic media accounts 
of the war, the potential for violent demonstrations will increase as 
the fighting nears Baghdad.

PUBLIC ATTENTION 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 1453 
 
Classified By: CONS/PD C.BEAMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) and (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C) Hundreds of illegal aliens took to the streets on 
August 16 to protest the Djiboutian Government\'s declaration 
that all illegals must depart the country by August 31.  As 
the deadline approaches, Djiboutian security forces are 
conducting regular sweeps of the city.  Over 300 persons per 
day reportedly are leaving voluntarily.  Many other suspected 
illegals are being detained in often overcrowded and 
unsanitary detention facilities as they await deportation. 
Human rights activists report deaths related to mistreatment 
of deportees.  The Government of Djibouti initially pressured 
the World Food Program to divert food stocks designated for 
Food for Work and school feeding programs to detention 
facilities but has now withdrawn its request. 
 
2. (C) Although the new policy has drawn widespread public 
support, the sweeps have also created a climate of 
uncertainty among local residents, many of whom now carry 
identity cards for fear of being detained.  Although the 
expulsions are ostensibly an attempt to improve poor economic 
conditions by creating more jobs for Djiboutians, they are 
widely perceived to be the result of American pressure on the 
government to tighten security.  The Djiboutian government 
has done nothing to dispel this impression.  We will need to 
stress to our interlocutors that a pattern of human rights 
violations could negatively impact our bilateral 
relationship.  We may also wish to mount a renewed public 
relations campaign, in conjunction with the U.S. military 
camp, to emphasize U.S. humanitarian activities.  End Summary. 
 
INTRO/DEMONSTRATIONS 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C) The Ministry of Interior\'s July 26 declaration that 
all illegal aliens must leave the country by August 31 has 
drawn increasing public attention in Djibouti city. 
Illegals, mostly from Ethiopia and Somalia, comprise a 
significant portion of the population.  Many work in blue 
collar positions which some Djiboutians have declined to 
accept. 
 
4. (C) Several hundred aliens participated in two separate 
August 16 demonstrations against the expulsions.  In one 
demonstration, several hundred Somaliphone ethnic Issa 
Ethiopians protested at the National Office for Assistance of 
Refugees and Displaced persons.  These demonstrators perceive 
President Ismail Guelleh as a clan father figure who 
encouraged them to relocate to Djibouti during the civil war 
in the early 1990\'s to support his efforts against the 
northern Afar districts of Djibouti.  They now feel betrayed 
by the new policies which will repatriate them to an 
unfamiliar Ethiopia.  Riot police closely observed this group 
of demonstrators but did not apprehend or detain anyone. 
 
5. (C) A second group of non-Issa Ethiopians appealed to the 
National Population Center for an extension of the August 31 
deadline.  This group complained that they had been unable to 
settle their business interests here in Djibouti, were still 
owed salary arrears, and needed a few extra weeks to prepare 
themselves for departure.  Police in riot gear filled two 
military trucks with approximately fifty individuals from 
this second group and reportedly dropped them at the 
Ethiopian frontier in the late evening of August 16. 
 
SWEEPS AND DEATHS 
----------------- 
 
6. (C) The National Police and Gendarmerie of Djibouti have 
begun rounding up, detaining, and deporting suspected 
illegals.  They are held at the Nagad detention center near 
Camp Lemonier and then either trucked to the border or loaded 
onto the Djibouti-Addis Ababa train.  According to a Somali 
domestic of an Embassy FSN, he was held for six days in Nagad 
in a room packed so tightly with people he could hardly move. 
 He reported receiving three meals in the six day period 
before a police captain became so disgusted with the stench 
emanating from the chamber that he ordered his subordinates 
to evacuate some of the occupants before they died.  The 
domestic reported that the group was divided into Somali and 
non-Somali Ethiopian ethnicities.  The Somalis were told to 
leave and not come back while the Ethiopians were returned to 
the detention cell.  The domestic returned to the Embassy 
FSN\'s home to gather some clothes and money before departing 
for Somaliland. 
7. (C) Jean Paul Noel, President of the Djiboutian League of 
Human Rights, told Emboff on August 12 that some illegals had 
already died in the deportation process.  Noel stated that 
two persons recently perished after Ethiopian security forces 
refused to accept them at the frontier because they were 
originally from Somalia.  The Djiboutian security forces at 
the scene reportedly refused to take them back to Djibouti 
City.  They were left to walk in an unfamiliar area without 
food or water and perished.  Noel reported that four persons 
died in similar fashion on the Somaliland frontier.  He added 
that two Ethiopian prostitutes died in detention on the 
Ethiopian frontier after a sweep brought a truck full of 
women from Djibouti city to the border without documentation. 
Rumors of rape and mistreatment of suspected illegals abound, 
but post is unable to verify these allegations. 
 
APPEAL TO WFP 
------------- 
 
8. (C) World Food Program (WFP) logistics chief and acting 
director Robert Gillenwater reported that he was under heavy 
pressure from the Minister of the Interior to divert U.S. 
food stocks from Food for Work and School feeding programs to 
detention centers.  The Minister has since withdrawn this 
request due to the anticipated negative public perception 
that Djiboutians would be losing food aid to foreigners. 
 
9. (C) The Minister has persuaded UNHCR to construct a 
\"transition center\" in the southern district of Ali Sabieh to 
hold three to four thousand individuals claiming asylum or 
urban refugee status.  Rafik Said, UNHCR\'s principal 
administrator for the Africa office on temporary duty in 
Djibouti, told Emboff that the center\'s purpose was to vet 
the over 12,000 people granted \"urban refugee\" status by the 
Djiboutian National Office for Assistance for Refugees and 
Displaced Persons over the last three years.  When queried as 
to where the resources for this action would be found Mr. 
Said responded that there was already a small budget for the 
urban refugee population and that UNHCR had certain \"surplus\" 
resources both in WFP warehouses and in non-foodstuff goods. 
 
SCRAMBLE FOR DOCUMENTATION 
-------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Djiboutian law states that citizenship is based on 
proof of the Djiboutian nationality of both parents.  In 
practice, however, Djiboutian nationality appears to be 
available to those willing to pay an adequate price. 
Observers suggest it is more readily available to Somali Issa 
applicants than to others.  Many residents of Djibouti have 
previously had little use for identity documents.  Students, 
for example, who have recently completed their high school 
studies and wish to study abroad have typically only then 
commenced the registration process directly with local 
authorities.  One of Post\'s Yemeni FSNs was born in Djibouti 
to parents who have lived in Djibouti since the 1940\'s but 
only last week sought to obtain his identity card.  He 
reported that he was refused several times before being 
granted audience with the director of the National Population 
Center, at which time he was able to obtain an identity card 
for 100,000 DF (about $500). 
 
11. (C) In recent weeks, crowds at the Population Center have 
become increasingly unruly, but it is difficult if not 
impossible to gain admittance.  Mahdi God, editor of the 
weekly \"La Realite\", told Conoff that appointments at the 
Population Center were only available to applicants who were 
Somali Issa or closely tied to a political heavyweight.  This 
practice, if true, will strengthen the already strong Issa 
electoral majority, as identity cards afford the right to 
vote. 
 
TIED TO U.S. SECURITY CONCERNS? 
------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) Djibouti city becomes quieter and emptier as the 
illegal population dwindles.  Many Djiboutians now 
increasingly make sure that they do not leave home without a 
copy of their identity card for fear of being detained. 
Djiboutians on vacation in Ethiopia claim to have been 
attacked and some have returned home to Djibouti rather than 
risk harm. 
 
13. (C) The publicized rationale for the dragnet against 
foreigners, and the main basis of its popularity, is that it 
is necessary to address the unemployment rate among 
Djiboutians, thought to be as high as sixty percent.  The 
targets of the new policy are almost entirely Somalis 
(largely from Somaliland) and Ethiopians (both of Somali and 
non-Somali ethnicity).   Djibouti\'s population includes 
significant numbers of Somalis or Afars from Somaliland and 
Ethiopia, but of an earlier generation.  While there are no 
reliable statistics on the number of illegals in Djibouti, 
they are sure to number tens of thousands in a country whose 
population is far less than one million. 
 
14. (C) However, Djiboutian sources tell us that police on 
the streets are explaining that their actions stem from U.S. 
pressure to improve security and control Djibouti\'s borders. 
Djiboutian leaders have done nothing to reverse this 
widely-held view. 
 
A POPULAR MOVE, BUT WITH WHAT CONSEQUENCES? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
15. (C) Opinion is split as to whether Djiboutians will be 
willing to undertake many of the jobs now filled by illegals. 
 Daher Ahmed Farah, a prominent oppositionist whom we might 
have expected to support the cause of the illegals, told us 
August 12 that he felt the economic conditions in Djibouti 
had reached such lows that Djiboutians were ready to step in 
and accept any wage-paying position.  He strongly supported 
the expulsions, also on security grounds. 
 
16. (C) The illegals make up an overwhelming percentage of 
the domestic worker population in Djibouti and many 
Djiboutians, including Embassy employees, will be impacted by 
the loss of their household staff.  A female FSN noted that 
the Djiboutian men all support the action because none of 
them will have to cook or watch the kids after the domestics 
depart.  \"Djiboutians might work for you expats,\" she said, 
\"but not in the home of another Djiboutian.\"  Heretofore, the 
social connotation of being a wage laborer cleaning or 
swinging a shovel has discouraged many Djiboutians from 
accepting these jobs even when offered.  Jean Paul Noel 
lamented that he would have much preferred to hire a fellow 
Darod clansmen as his household guardian but that he had been 
forced to hire an Oromo because none of his clansmen would 
take the job. 
 
17. (C) A female Djiboutian judge told Charge privately that 
she believed the Minister of Interior\'s policy was correct. 
She insisted, however, that the new regulations were not 
directed at household staff, particularly those who, though 
themselves illegally resident in Djibouti, are working for 
relatives who are Djiboutian or permanently resident here. 
Nonetheless, when Charge asked whether a legal mechanism 
existed for concerned employers to obtain residence or work 
permits for their staff, she could not provide a definitive 
response. 
 
COMMENT: ARE THE EXPULSIONS REAL? 
--------------------------------- 
 
18. (C) Expulsions of foreigners are nothing new in 
Djibouti--sweeps are a regular feaure of the landscape.  This 
newest effort has the ring of greater seriousness, but its 
long-term viablity is still open to question, as no efforts 
are being made to record or register the deported aliens. 
 
19. (C) The current popularity of the policy is likely to be 
short-lived if significant social services are disrupted 
following the mass exodus of affected laborers.  Djiboutians 
already frequently deplore the perceived detioration of 
sanitation and public works under the current administration. 
 
20. (C) The return of many deportees may be inevitable, in 
the absence of a much more systematic approach.  The USG is 
assisting the Djiboutian Government in its efforts to control 
its borders and identify floating populations.  USG programs 
currently on-deck will target these areas and should help in 
the registration and identification of persons entering and 
leaving the country. 
 
21. (C) We are disturbed by the recent allegations of abuses 
of the deportees, all the more so because the most recent 
expulsions are widely believed to be the result of U.S. 
pressure to beef up security.  In our discussions with our 
Djiboutian interlocutors, we must take every opportunity to 
stress that such actions will not be tolerated, and that a 
pattern of human rights violations could adversely affect the 
bilateral relationship, including the provision of 
assistance.  We are also working with the U.S. military at 
Camp Lemonier to explore the possibility of a renewed public 
relations campaign to highlight U.S. civil affairs projects.

1.  (C) Summary:  In response to ref A demarche dissociating 
the U.S. from Djibouti\'s on-going expulsions of foreigners, 
Minister of Interior Wais deplored U.S. insistence on making 
a public statement.  He stressed Djibouti\'s good historical 
record on handling refugees, noted that foreigners had been 
given an extra 15 days to leave, and claimed (falsely) that 
forcible expulsions had not yet occurred and that there had 
been no human rights violations.  In a subsequent meeting, 
Chief of Staff Fathi admitted that the popular view in 
Djibouti was that the U.S. had ordered the expulsions and 
said that Djibouti was entirely responsible, but he displayed 
no greater grasp of the potential negative repercussions of 
pinning the expulsions on the United States.  The Embassy 
will promulgate a public statement, drawn from ref A, with 
local and international news media.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) Charge had back-to-back, hour-and-a-half meetings 
September 3 with Minister of Interior Abdoulkader Douale Wais 
and Chief of Armed Forces General Fathi Ahmad Houssein.  The 
meeting with Wais, requested by Charge, was devoted entirely 
to ongoing expulsions of undocumented foreigners and ref A 
demarche.  The meeting with Fathi was requested by Fathi and 
dealt principally with what Fathi described as President 
Guelleh\'s lack of clarity about the contents of U.S. 
assistance.  It was notable most of all for Fathi\'s frank 
statement that Guelleh was urgent to learn precisely what 
assistance Djibouti would be obtaining from the U.S., because 
of elections upcoming in 2005.  The concluding part of the 
meeting with Fathi addressed the expulsions.  General Zakaria 
Cheick Ibrahim, number two in the Djibouti armed forces, 
joined the meeting with Fathi just as the discussion on 
expulsions commenced.  (Note:  It was Zakaria, in Fathi\'s 
absence from the country, who made the request August 21 to 
CJTF-HOA Commander General Robeson for the U.S. to provide 
troops to help patrol the Djibouti land borders to ensure 
that Ethiopians and Somalis now being expelled not return, 
ref C.)  Charge left with both interlocutors a copy of ref A 
talking points, along with an Embassy translation of those 
points into French.  Charge was accompanied in both meetings 
by ADCM, USLO Major Anderson, and political-consular officer 
Beamer. 
 
------------------------ 
Wais and General Abizaid 
------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) Wais opened with praise for the very close 
cooperation between Djibouti and the United States in 
combatting terrorism, emanating from the meeting of President 
Guelleh with President Bush at the beginning of the year. 
Wais said he wanted to reinforce this cooperation in every 
way possible.  In this vein, he said that he had requested a 
meeting with General Abizaid during the recent Golden Spear 
exercise in Ethiopia.  He had informed General Abizaid of 
Djibouti\'s deep concern about the large population of 
clandestine immigrants in Djibouti.  Somali immigrants were a 
worry because Somalia had no government, and Ethiopian 
immigrants were a worry because there might exist some of 
them in Djibouti who collaborated with Oromo or Somali armed 
fronts opposing the Ethiopian government.  Wais said that he 
had told General Abizaid that he did not want Americans in 
Djibouti to be worried about problems from such immigrants, 
nor did he want Djiboutians to be worried because the 
Americans now were present in Djibouti in significant 
numbers.  He said that he had asked General Abizaid to help 
Djibouti in its effort to control clandestine immigrants, 
both on the border and within the country. 
 
4.  (C) Wais said that since the policy of expelling 
clandestine immigrants had been announced July 26, tens of 
thousands had peacefully and volutarily departed.  Djibouti 
had now extended the deadline from September 1 to September 
15.  With the departure of these illegal immigrants, the 
problem would shift toward surveiling and controlling the 
borders so that they did not return.  Wais had already been 
in close contact with the Embassy on improving border control 
modalities.  He looked forward to ever closer collaboration 
to ensure that only properly documented persons entered the 
country.  Djibouti and the United States, he said, were 
entirely in the same boat in the effort to consolidate 
security. 
 
------------ 
The Demarche 
------------ 
 
5.  (C) Charge expressed his great pleasure in making his 
first call upon arriving in Djibouti on Wais and his complete 
agreement with Wais\'s positive characterization of the close 
cooperation between the United States and Djibouti.  However, 
Charge said, the United States was deeply concerned about the 
perception among the Djiboutian populace that the present 
expulsions of undocumented immigrants were attributable to 
the United States.  The concern was sufficiently acute that 
he had received instructions to address the issue at the 
highest levels of the Djibouti Government.  In addition to 
leaving copies of these instructions, he would take the 
opportunity to discuss each element with the minister in some 
detail. 
 
6.  (C) Charge said that, as the minister knew, human rights 
were a basic and a legislatively-mandated principle and key 
element in the United States\' relations with every country. 
Human rights became even more important and closely watched 
in any relationship in which the security element was large 
and growing rapidly.  For example, Charge noted, human rights 
organizations that had not previously devoted much time to 
Djibouti were now beginning to watch Djibouti very closely, 
on account of the new U.S. military presence and close 
collaboration.  The United States recognized the sovereign 
right of every state to control its borders and, 
specifically, Djibouti\'s sovereign right to deport 
undocumented aliens.  As the minister had pointed out, we 
were working closely with Djibouti to improve its border 
security. 
 
7.  (C) Charge said that the United States had had no role 
whatever in the formulation of Djibouti\'s policy to expel 
foreigners.  We were deeply concerned about reports on human 
rights abuses that were occurring as a result of these 
operations.  It might be that such reports were false, but 
whether true or false, they came in the context of a public 
perception that the United States was behind the operations. 
While the United States recognized Djibouti\'s absolute 
sovereign right to deport aliens, it held as a fundamental 
principle that deportations be carried out in a fully 
transparent manner and with full assurance of fundamental, 
internationally-recognized human rights.  Djibouti had thus 
far engendered no focused hostility from within the U.S. 
Congress or among human-rights groups, but unless it were 
careful in its handling of its expulsion operations, that 
situation could change.  Moreover, there was the possiblity 
of unfortunate accidents and unintended events -- for 
example, deaths of deported persons in the deserts of 
neighboring states -- which would be blamed, derivatively, on 
the United States. 
 
8.  (C) In addition to the points in his instructions, Charge 
continued, he wanted to point out that there was a security 
concern on the part of the CJTF-HOA emanating from the public 
perception of U.S. instigation of the expulsions.  It was 
clear that many people, Djiboutian and non-Djiboutian, were 
opposed to the operation.  Some of these people could 
conceivably direct their anger toward the United States, 
given the wide perception of U.S. involvement.  CJTF was 
concerned that it might have to lower its profile, with 
consequences for its civic-action and humanitarian projects 
in Djibouti as well as liberty for its soldiers to move 
outside the camp, with concomitant negative economic 
consequences for Djibouti.  (Note:  This point was raised by 
General Robeson during Charge\'s introductory call on him 
September 2.) 
 
9.  (C) Charge, concluding, said that the United States would 
make a public statement dissociating itself from Djibouti\'s 
expulsion policy.  In regard to the minister\'s request for 
assistance of the previous week (note:  Wais requested an 
immigration information program, creation and enlargement of 
transit centers, rehabilitation of former prisons, 20 trucks, 
10 jeeps, and 300 tents, ref B), the United States would not 
be able to address the items as an expedited package, 
although it might be possible to discuss certain elements in 
the future under propitious conditions. 
 
------------- 
Wais\'s Regret 
------------- 
 
10.  (C)  In response, Wais provided a lengthy review of what 
he described as Djibouti\'s excellent and humane record in 
handling refugees, including those from the 1977 
Ethiopian-Somali war immediately after Djiboutian 
independence, those later from the fall of Mengistu, those 
from Siad Barre\'s attack on Somaliland, those from the 
bloodshed and instability that flowed from Siad Barre\'s fall, 
and also refugees from war and instability in Eritrea and 
Yemen.  The present operations did not touch any of these 
refugees, nor did they touch those foreigners who were at 
present requesting asylum.  These operations affected only 
those persons who were present in Djibouti with no legal 
standing whatever.  Considering the respect and dignity which 
Djibouti had always afforded all persons who had ever entered 
its territory and who could provide the least indication of 
refugee or asylum status, Wais deplored and regretted that 
the United States now sought to make a public statement of 
this kind.  False rumors and disinformation were an 
unfortunate part of the world today.  It was necessary to 
operate not by rumor but on the basis of reality.  The 
Charge\'s officers in the Embassy should have properly 
informed Washington on these issues and undertaken full 
discussions with Djibouti before embarking on such a public 
statement.  The Charge was free to go where he liked, when he 
liked, throughout Djibouti to see for himself the falseness 
of these rumors.  The government had not yet started 
operations at all, but merely invited illegal foreigners to 
leave; no one had been touched or harmed.  So many people had 
already departed the country, following his many broadcasts 
on television and radio, that he did not think there would be 
any need for a mass expulsion operation. 
 
11.  (C) Charge said that the present demarche and public 
statement were in no way intended to criticize Djibouti in 
its handling of refugees in the past.  The issue was the 
association of the United States as author of a policy which 
engendered much opposition and much bad press.  Djibouti\'s 
relations with the United States would now be held to a 
higher standard than previously and it was in the interest of 
both nations that the United States not be associated with 
this policy.  Our public statement would serve both nations\' 
interests. 
 
12.  (C) Wais said that Djibouti remained confident in its 
policy and proud of its record on human rights.  It would not 
change its policy.  He hoped that American preoccupations 
about the expulsions policy would dissipate when it became 
clear that rumors of human-rights violations were completely 
false.  He hoped that officers in the Embassy would portray 
accurately for the Charge Djibouti\'s exemplary record and the 
extraordinary warmth with which the Djiboutian people had 
welcomed the U.S. military into their midst. 
 
----------------------------- 
Less Defensive Chief of Staff 
----------------------------- 
 
13.  (C)  At the conclusion of the separate, follow-on 
meeting with Chief of Staff General Fathi, Charge raised the 
issue of expulsions and the particular problem the United 
States had with being portrayed as responsible for them. 
Fathi immediately interjected that, indeed, people in 
Djibouti did believe that the U.S. had ordered the 
expulsions.  Charge remarked that this perception created a 
serious problem for the U.S. politically, to which Fathi 
seemed surprised and asked why? 
 
14.  (C) Charge furnished Fathi with ref A talking points and 
offered a precis of the demarche.  In sum, he said, 
associating the U.S. with the expulsions could only diminish 
the considerable support that Djibouti\'s relations with the 
U.S. now enjoyed in the Congress and among human-rights 
groups.  Fathi remarked that problems with Congress were an 
issue for the United States not Djibouti, to which Charge 
demurred.  The Embassy was going to put out a public 
statement underlining that the United States had nothing to 
do with the policy.  Fathi said that it was incumbent on the 
Embassy to set the record straight with policy-makers in 
Washington.  Charge replied that reports in the press carried 
far more impact than anything that an embassy might report. 
Then, Fathi exclaimed, it was for the embassy to invite in 
journalists and set them straight.  Indeed, the policy to 
deport illegal foreigners was a Djiboutian decision by the 
Djiboutian government.  Such foreigners represented forty 
percent of the population, at a time when the unemployment 
rate was increasing.  If a Djiboutian went to Ethiopia or 
Yemen he was not permitted to work, so why should Ethiopians 
or Yemenis come to Djibouti?   Charge repeated that the 
United States completely recognized Djibouti\'s sovereign 
right to make this policy.  Fathi said, \"We are responsible 
for it, and we take the responsibility.\" 
 
15.  (C)  Comment:  Wais took this demarche much harder than 
Fathi, as he had much more at stake in the policy.  It caught 
Wais unawares, and his surprise and the difficulty he had in 
comprehending the rationale for the demarche and public 
statement are a measure of how poorly he comprehended the 
human-rights ramifications of the expulsions and the 
implications for the Djibouti-U.S. relationship.  The entire 
Djiboutian power elite may share much the same lack of 
comprehension.  Wais\'s assertion that the expulsions had not 
yet started was simply false.  We suspect that Wais was 
behind media leaks pointing to U.S. complicity.  Fathi 
notably made no attempt to associate the current expulsion 
policy with a security need.  Rather, he emphasized the 
economic and employment dimension, in contrast to Zakaria\'s 
earlier emphasis on security (ref C).

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI:  ASSISTANCE CONFUSION 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 1633 
 
Classified By: ADCM Haywood Rankin for reason 1.5 (b,d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Chief of Armed Forces Fathi conveyed to 
Charge September 3 President Guelleh\'s confusion and vexation 
-- directed mainly at Djibouti\'s ambassador in Washington -- 
about assistance from the United States.  He said, perhaps 
too frankly, that Guelleh was nervous because he needed to 
begin his election campaign for 2005.  Guelleh is supposed to 
return September 5 to Djibouti, after more than a month away, 
and Charge has requested an appointment.  The fundamental 
problem is that the Djiboutians are accustomed to the simpler 
French way of handling assistance and have a steep learning 
curve with the Americans (and vice versa).  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Chief of Staff of the Djibouti Armed Forces General 
Fathi Ahmed Houssein summoned Charge September 3.  The final 
third of the conversation, which concerned Djibouti\'s ongoing 
expulsion of undocumented foreigners, is treated in reftel. 
Prior to the meeting, the embassy learned that the subject on 
Fathi\'s mind was a 1.7 million dollar bill for paving the 
ramp at the hangar for the presidential aircraft, for which 
the Djiboutian military expected to be reimbursed by the 
United States. 
 
----------------------------- 
Presidential Plane and Olhaye 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Fathi opened the meeting saying he had hoped to get 
clarity on an issue of great importance to President Guelleh, 
relating to the presidential aircraft, but he realized he 
needed General Robeson and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to 
be present.  CJTF-HOA Djibouti desk officer Michael dell\' 
Amico presented General Robeson\'s apologies for \"not being 
able to attend.\"  Fathi said that President Guelleh was keen 
to get the presidential aircraft up from South Africa, where 
it resided at present, and to do so it was necessary that the 
work at the presidential hangar be finished. 
 
4.  (C) Fathi said that Djiboutians were having a very 
difficult time, in general, understanding what was agreed and 
not agreed on the part of the United States -- the 
presidential ramp and hangar being one example.  President 
Guelleh, he said, was deeply agitated by the reporting that 
had come in from Ambassador Olhaye in Washington about U.S. 
assistance to Djibouti.  Charge recalled the meeting which he 
had earlier attended in Washington with Ambassador Olhaye, 
concerning the East Africa Counterterrorism Initiative, and 
believed that the explanation given Olhaye had been 
relatively straightforward and that Olhaye had grasped it. 
However, Charge explained, there was no doubt that U.S. 
funding processes, whether civilian or military, were 
complex.  Charge offered several examples of how different 
types of funding processes worked. 
 
--------------------- 
We are not the French 
--------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Fathi said that at the military level Djiboutians 
were beginning to understand how the American system worked. 
He cited an example of military equipment that had been 
ordered in the year 2002 but which, it now appeared, would 
not arrive until 2005.  USLO Major Anderson reminded Fathi 
that he, Fathi, had only signed the contract for this 
equipment three months ago.  Fathi said, yes, now he was 
beginning to understand, and in general the Djiboutian 
military was beginning to get the picture.  But President 
Guelleh was totally confused and completely troubled. 
Guelleh now told him that he understood nothing that had been 
reported by Ambassador Olhaye on the subject of U.S. 
assistance.  Guelleh wanted to start all over.  He wanted a 
clear, practical, down-to-earth, simple piece of paper that 
told him what Djibouti was going to get and when.  The 
problem was, Fathi explained, that President Guelleh would 
begin next year his campaign for reelection in 2005.  He 
needed already, now, to expedite payment of pensions and 
salaries, in preparation for that campaign.  To do that he 
needed to know what money he was going to have in hand and 
when.  When Guelleh had received the payment for the lease of 
Camp Lemonier, he had immediately used a portion of that cash 
to pay arrears of pensions and salaries.  Djiboutians were 
now being paid promptly at the end of the month and knew to 
thank the United States. 
 
6.  (C) Charge said that he hoped to be seeing President 
Guelleh soon and would offer as good an explanation as he 
could.  However, it was necessary to realize that the U.S. 
had a completely different system of providing assistance 
from France\'s.  In the Charge\'s consultations in Paris the 
previous week, he had learned that France had promised 
Djibouti a total package of military and civilian expenditure 
in Djibouti of 55 million dollars annually; part of that 
package was an agreement that if the military component went 
down, the civilian component would go up in equal measure. 
It was a nice, clean system, but it bore no resemblance to 
the way the United States did business. 
 
7.  (C) Fathi said he did not ask the Americans to be French. 
 Djibouti only asked for clarity.  It did not need to know 
what assistance would cost the U.S. government (which, Charge 
pointed out, was what the U.S. government announces) but what 
Djibouti would receive.  Fathi said that it would be 
preferable if the U.S. took out all expenses for overhead and 
administration that would reduce the net amount of assistance 
dollars realized in Djibouti, prior to giving Guelleh the 
monetary value of U.S. assistance.  President Guelleh would 
be returning to Djibouti in a couple of days and he would 
need a firm list of what Djibouti would get, how much cash, 
how much in the way of projects, their value to Djibouti, and 
their execution dates. 
 
8.  (C) Fathi said that Djibouti had asked for nothing from 
the United States.  It had gone through many lean years, and 
its nomadic populace could survive off of dates and water. 
It was the United States that had offered help, which was 
indeed desperately needed, and Djibouti just wanted to know 
what to expect.  He realized that there was extremely good 
will on both sides, and that these were only the unavoidable 
problems of adaptation to each other\'s ways. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) Fathi enjoys a close relationship with Guelleh.  He 
is one of Guelleh\'s four or five closest qat-chewers, which 
may explain why he was nominated -- or nominated himself -- 
to venture into the non-military assistance zone.  In fact, 
there should not be much \"lack of clarity\" about non-military 
assistance.  Djiboutian ministries on the receiving end of 
ESF handled by USAID are not complaining about lack of 
clarity.  In the military field, Fathi has signed -- with 
Guelleh\'s consent -- a letter of request that obligates 
virtually all of the 25 million dollar East African 
Counterterrorism Initiative projects.  But there is, indeed, 
a steep learning curve.  Moreover, Djiboutians are tough 
negotiators and not averse to crying confusion as a 
negotiating ploy.  Olhaye may be an impediment, as he appears 
to embellish his reports to Guelleh. 
 
10.  (C) Although elections in Djibouti are far from what 
they are in the west, Guelleh may well harbor election 
anxieties.  The advent of the Americans has raised public 
expectations of American largesse.  As the people do not see 
much immediate evidence of this supposed largesse, they 
suspect that their leader has pocketed or misspent it. 
Guelleh would like to deflect these suspicions.  Fathi\'s 
other striking assertion -- that Guelleh used the lease money 
in part to pay salary and pension arrearages -- raises the 
question of what happened to the money budgeted for those 
salaries and underlines the lack of transparency in 
Djiboutian financial management.

1. (SBU) Because of the request for an immediate report, we 
have been  unable to reach non-State offices for clearance. 
For this reason, this cable is less detailed and shorter than 
a full report would be. 
 
2. (S) Summary:  Thursday, September 4, Combined Joint Task 
Force/Horn of Africa (CJTF/HOA), housed at Camp Lemonier on 
the southern end of Djibouti\'s Ambouli International Airport, 
prepared for the possible apprehension of one of East 
Africa\'s most prominent terrorists, the Al Qaeda leader 
associated with the Embassy bombings in 1998 and Mombassa 
attack of 2002,   CJTF actions included an evacuation drill 
which removed most of the camp\'s personnel to areas outside the 
compound in order to lower the potential death toll of a 
September 11-type suicide plane attack on the base.  Special 
Forces units mobilized to assist Djiboutian authorities in 
the possible orderly capture of a high-level Al Qaeda 
operative, or to deal with a hostage situation or prolonged 
standoff.  AmEmbassy Djibouti assisted CJTF by obtaining 
President Ismail Omar Guelleh\'s permission for the proposed 
operations and the President\'s instruction to Djiboutian 
security forces to follow the directions of CTFJ and the 
Embassy Regional Affair officer in case of an operation at 
the airport.(End Summary) 
 
3. (S) Intelligence received by CJTF at 11:45 suggested that 
Kenyan citizen Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, the Al Qaeda leader 
believed to have had direct links with all three successful 
terrorist attacks in Kenya, would be departing on a 
commercial flight from Mogadishu.   Because of the 
possibility that Nabhan might be planning a suicide bombing 
attempt on the approximately 1700 American military personnel 
stationed at Lemonier, CJTF/HOA Commander Brigadier General 
Mastin Robeson ordered an evacuation drill to take all but a 
skeleton crew out of the danger zone of a direct hit during 
the scheduled arrival times for the three commercial flights 
(3:00 to 4:30 pm). 
 
4. (S) While the Station Chief and CJTF worked with 
Djiboutian security forces to prepare for Nabhan\'s 
apprehension or hostage standoff, American Embassy officers 
worked through the President\'s Qat-impaired aides to obtain 
Guelleh\'s personal approval of the arrest of Nabhan and his 
order to Djiboutian security forces to support the American 
plan. However, Nabhan did not arrive on any of the flights, 
and the operation stood down at approximately 5:30 pm. 
 
5. (S) Conclusion: CJTF forced were able to respond quickly 
to implement their plan.  Despite some initial difficulties 
with communications, we were equally effective in getting 
Presidential permission for the operation.  While permission 
probably would have been possible after the fact, Post 
believes that our  effort was important for maintaining 
Guelleh\'s complete support for the Global War on Terrorism. 
Tomorrow\'s (September 5) after-action meeting will prepare a 
report and allow all parties the opportunity to work off some 
of the rougher edges.

PRESS STATEMENT 
--------------- 
 
2. (U) Per guidance in ref A post released the following 
language in a press communiqu on September 4. 
 
BEGIN PRESS STATEMENT: \"The United States Government is 
concerned with the public perception and the mis- 
representation by certain media that it has played a role 
in the Djiboutian Government\'s current deportation 
policy.  The United States recognizes the sovereign right 
of every state to control its borders and to require that 
all persons be properly admitted and documented. 
However, the United States has played no role in the 
formation of the Djiboutian Government\'s current policy. 
 
The United States Government is deeply concerned about 
reports of mistreatment of detainees and related human 
rights abuses.  We believe that it is essential that all 
status determinations and deportations be carried out 
with full assurance of fundamental internationally- 
recognized human rights. 
 
The United States appreciates the strengthened bilateral 
relationship established with Djibouti.  Progress toward 
democratization and careful observance of internationally- 
recognized human rights are important to that 
relationship.\" 
 
END STATEMENT. 
 
Coverage 
-------- 
 
3. (U) PD Officer met with both the editor of the state 
biweekly newspaper and the director of state radio and 
television on September 4 to seek placement of the press 
release.  Both deferred commitment on this sensitive 
political issue but promised increased cooperation on 
coverage of positive aspects of the U.S. military 
presence in Djibouti.  The state biweekly newspaper, \"La 
Nation,\" ran a page 5 piece on the statement on September 
8 titled \"Les Etats-Unis ne sont pas impliques dans les 
operations de refoulement des clandestins\" (Unofficial 
translation- The United States is not involved in the 
operations to expel illegal immigrants).  The piece took 
some editorial liberty with the statement but was 
encouraging to the degree that we obtained any state 
coverage at all.  To date, state radio and television 
have not covered the statement. 
 
4. (U) Opposition media in Djibouti consist of two weekly 
newspapers, \"Le Renouveau\" and \"La Realite.\"  Le 
Renouveau is under temporary suspension after the 
imprisonment of its editor, Daher Ahmed Farah, last 
spring/summer and will not recommence publication until 
October.  PD Officer met with members of La Realite on 
September 8 and they stated that they would include the 
USG statement in this week\'s edition. 
 
5. (U) International media have paid significant 
attention to the release, and radio coverage (comment: 
the most effective news transmitter in this oral society) 
has been excellent.  PD officer responded to questions 
from RFI with language from the release which was 
broadcast on September 5-7.  The BBC and VOA have run 
pieces of the statement since its September 4 release. 
The BBC has requested a radio interview on September 11. 
Reuters has requested a video interview the week of 
September 15 when their crew arrives in Djibouti to cover 
the expulsions. 
 
COMMENT 
-------- 
 
6. (SBU) Despite indications that the more cynical 
Djiboutians believe the USG is \"covering its tracks,\" 
after most of the expulsions have already taken place, 
our message has gone out and been heard. Local allies and 
sympathizers, as well as those open to persuasion, now 
have the official statement that the USG played no role 
in the recent immigration policy. 
 
7. (SBU) EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THE LINE IN THE SAND. WE 
HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL RESPOND PUBLICLY TO 
MISREPRESENTATION OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AND THAT 
OUR COMMITMENT TO THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS REAL.

leading any charge on Iraq, but it will not be a negative 
force.  It is small, poor, and in Arab League terms, 
peripheral.  It is also more exposed than ever, with an 
American base on its soil now, in addition to the French 
garrison. 
 
2.  (C) Djibouti particularly does not want to get out in 
front of Arab states on Arab issues, as it does not want to 
annoy rich and powerful Arab patrons.  Nor does it want to go 
out of its way to pick a fight with France, however tetchy it 
often feels in its relationship with its former colonial 
master and present protector. 
 
3.  (C) That said, Djibouti has no ax to grind on Iraq. 
Moreover, it is likely to see great potential benefits from 
the U.S. if it were to accede to our wishes on a subject of 
such great importance to us.  The Djibouti leadership finds 
itself caught between a rock and a hard place, and we have 
intermittent signs that it may still be considering the idea 
of some sort of very low-level military participation in Iraq.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI NEC SITES - RESPONSE TO ASSEMBLY OF 
RELEVANT INFORMATION 
 
REF: A) State 088579, B) State 237442 
 
1.  Post researched the topics raised in ref. B) and 
provides the following responses. 
 
2.  REAL ESTATE 
QA.  Is Fee Simple land ownership available to the USG ?  If 
not, what other types of land interests are available ?  If 
a Crown lease or similar long-term lease is available, how 
long is the usal term ?  Are such leases automatically 
renewable ?  At what cost, if any ? 
 
3.  AA:  The average land ownership fees are Djibouti Franc 
(DF) 5,000 m2 in the area near the airport as well as in 
Heron, provided one deals directly with the Ministry of 
Finance.  However, the fees could go up to DF 10,000/m2 in 
areas such as Heron if one buys from a reseller.  Mr. 
Ibrahim Hamadou is the Director of Ministry of Finance. 
 
4.  QB.  How well does the Land Registry System work there? 
Are the records regarding land ownership reliable and 
accurate ? 
 
5.  AB:  The Land Registry System works well, through 
Ibrahim Hamadou\'s department.  The records regarding 
ownership are reliable and accurate. 
 
6.  QC:  Is there known corruption in that office ?  Can a 
prospective buyer expect that a true past and present 
ownership record obtained from this office is correct and 
not likely to be successfully challenged by a third party ? 
Is there known corruption within the real estate market or 
industry ?  If so, please describe how it might be 
encoutered by the USG and offer suggestions on how to avoid 
it. 
 
7.  AC:  Post cannot guarantee that corruption does not 
exist.  Post suggests dealing directly with the host 
government unit in charge of the process.  A prospective 
buyer can expect that a true past and present ownership 
record obtained from the Land Registry System is correct and 
not likely to be challenged by a third party. 
 
8.  QD:  If a use or zoning change becomes necessary for the 
selected site, please describe the government office 
involved and the general process for affecting the change. 
How cumbersome is the process ?  Is the 
government/municipality cooperative or adversarial ? 
 
9.  AD:  If a use or zoning change becomes necessary for the 
selected site, please coordinate with the Director of the 
Ministry of Finance (Ibrahim Hamadou).  He should be 
cooperative. 
 
10.  QE:  Generally, what is the condition of the real 
estate market ? Is it stagnant or robust or somewhere in 
between ? 
 
11.  AE:  The real estate market is high since Djibouti is 
involved in the anti-terrorism campaign with the presence of 
American, German, and other growing military and diplomatic 
missions present in country. 
 
12.  QF:  What is currently influencing supply and demand, 
such as geography, investment in infrastructure, interest 
rates, civil unrest, labor costs etc. 
 
13.  AF:  Djibouti\'s strategic geographical location and 
relative political stablity in an otherwise highly unstable 
region account for the present influx of foreigners, 
particularly Americans.  Its port remains Ethiopia\'s 
principal sea access, in the wake of Ethiopia\'s war with 
Eritrea which closed off Asab.  The present expulsion of 
undocumented foreigners will cause labor costs to increase 
markedly.  Construction must be earthquake proof.  Interest 
rates are high.  More generally, the real estate market in 
Djibouti is very small.  The Ministry of Finance indicated 
that most of the land in the town of Djibouti is privately 
owned.  Therefore, the supply of land is very limited 
irrespective of considerations such as geography, investment 
in infrastructure, etc.  Many people invest in land without 
having necessarily the means to build.  The demand for 
housing is influenced by a growing population eager to own 
property.  The government has set priorities in social 
housing programs. The Djiboutian government exercises a 
strong influence on determining available real estate supply 
in Djibouti city. 
 
14.  QG:  Is land available ?  Are vacant 10-acre parcels 
likely to be available within a reasonable commuting 
distance from where Post does business ?  Generally, what is 
happening there with various types of real estate ? 
 
15.  AG:  The land available around the Embassy-and in 
particular the price-is not completely clear at this point. 
There are three lots surrounding the Embassy (fourth side 
faces the water).  On the south side, there is an empty lot 
covering 8,464 m2 which is owned by the Saudi Arabian 
diplomatic mission.  They have not built on the lot and are 
aware of the possible need for the American embassy to 
expand.  No selling price has been made and it would not be 
surprsing if they asked for a high price given the lot\'s 
market value.  It is rectangular in form. 
 
16.  On the north side, along the beach front, is a lot 
belonging to the Railway Company and currently used by the 
Constitutional Committee.  There is a medium sized colonial 
style house on the land that is in fair condition.  The 
Ministry of Finance indicated this lot of 6,641 m2 is 
negotiable if the USG is interested.  A side street 
separating the embassy compound and the lot exists and is 
controlled by the embassy (rue d\'Alexandrie).  It is 
rectangular in form. 
 
17.  Finally, there is the lot across from the embassy, 
known as `Soleillet\' which covers 2,800 m2.  This includes 
an abandoned, dilapidated building of 22 apartments and a 
parking space behind the construction.  No price has been 
offered but it is subject to negotiation with the Ministry 
of Finance, Ibrahim Hamadou. The building would have to be 
demolished.  Moreover, if this site were selected, the 
street running in front of it and separating the lot from 
the embassy compound (Boulevard Marechal Joffre) would 
probably have to be preserved.  An underground path, small 
bridge or other structure would probably be necessary to 
communicate with the embassy compound.  The lot has, on one 
side, a street on which different organizations and 
residences are located.  That street leads to the open field 
of Plateau du Serpent where Djiboutian city dwellers would 
be evacuated and assembled in case of an emergency. 
 
18.  These three lots taken together with the embassy 
compound (15,400 m2), make for a total surface area of 
17,905 m2.  The shape of the combined lots would be in two 
segments : one large, uninterrupted rectangle with a beach 
front on one side, Boulevard Joffre on the other.  The 
second segment is a rectangular lot directly across from the 
embassy and over Boulevard Joffre.  The Government of 
Djibouti would strongly resist closing Boulevard Joffre. 
 
19.  Vacant 10-acres parcels are also likely to be available 
in the district of Haramous with presidential approval. 
Haramous is a reasonable commuting distance from where post 
does business (approximately 20 minutes away from the main 
town), although not nearly as convenient as the present 
chancery.  Security considerations would make this option 
unfavorable if chosen lots were in relatively isolated 
areas. 
 
20. LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS 
QH:  How available are technical services ?  Are there 
qualified engineering firms for geotechnical, civil, 
environmental surveys ? 
 
21.  AH :  The technical services are available via the 
Ministry of Equipment and Transportation. Engineering for 
geotechnical, civil, environmental survey is managed by Dr. 
Alexandre Adam, Director of the Central Laboratory of 
Building and Equipment, Tel/fax 35-11-68, BP 2372 Djibouti.

30.  AL:  Oral translators yes, written translators are 
available but less numerous.  Oral translators receive about 
U.S. $20-30 per hour. 
 
31.  UTILITIES 
QM :  In general, please describe the city\'s infrastructure 
and the relaiabilty of each utility : water, power, 
sewerage, gas, telecommunications. 
 
32.  AM:  It is fair to say that the water utilities are 
generally reliable with some shortage during summer. 
Investment is currently focused more on finding new water 
sources than improving the water distribution system. 
 
33.  The power utilities use fuel energy so electricity is 
quite expensive.  However, there has been investment in 
purchasing more generators, which has caused power outages 
to decrease to a few hours per month during summer and 
almost no outages during the cool season. 
 
34.  A few years ago, the government of Djibouti invested in 
a system for evacuation of rain water.  However, the 
sewerage system is rudimentary and not reliable. 
 
35.  Djibouti enjoys one of the best telecom systems in the 
region.  It is reliable but expensive. 
 
36.  QN :  Identify the companies/government agencies that 
provide and manage utilities and provide contact names and 
telephone numbers for each one.

Mr. Mohamed Kamil Ali, Directeur General 
 
41.  Djibouti telecom provides the following service: 
telephone, mobile phone, internet, telex.  These services 
are reliable but expensive. 
 
42.  QO:  Please advise if the City has any known public 
works projects planned or underway that affect the supply, 
capacity or future of utilities. 
 
43.  AO: None known. 
44.  OTHER PUBLIC SERVICES 
QP:  Is there adequate public transportation throughout the 
city ? If not, what parts are best served ?  Worst served ? 
Is it considered safe, reliable, and affordable ? 
 
45.  AP:  Public transportation in Djibouti is inadequate 
and risky.  Taxi cabs exist and are relatively inexpense, 
but they are not considered safe or reliable. 
 
46.  QQ.  What is the general status and availability of 
police protection ?  What is the general status and 
availability of fire protection ? What is the general status 
and availability of paved primary, secondary and tertiary 
roadways ? 
 
47.  AQ:  Police protection in the more populated areas is 
generally available.  The Police can be unreliable and 
subject to extortion and other forms of corruption. 
 
48.  Fire protection is somewhat good, but unreliable due to 
qat-chewing that weakens the responsiveness of firemen. 
 
49.  The primary road system is adequate but speckled with 
potholes and in need of maintenance.  The secondary roads 
are impaired and sometimes impassable.  Tertiary roads 
require 4WD vehicles to pass.  Large washouts, rock slides, 
and other obstacles frequently block these roads.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI:  UNITED DONOR CONCERN ABOUT EXPULSIONS 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 1633 
 
1.  Summary:  Donors (France, EU, U.S., UN agencies) met 
September 11 to discuss the immediate problems surrounding a 
makeshift transit center near the Ethiopian border and likely 
impending problems attendant on forcible deportations that 
are to begin September 15.  Donors agreed to try to present a 
united front with the Djiboutian government, in order to 
forestall its capitalizing on its own ill-advised expulsion 
policy and poor preparation to install another refugee camp 
cum donor-aid pump.  End summary. 
 
2.  Following up on ref demarche dissociating the U.S. from 
Djibouti\'s expulsions of foreigners, we prompted UNDP chief 
(UN resrep) in Djibouti, Mbaranga Gasarabwe, to host an 
unprecendented round-table donors\' meeting on September 11. 
The meeting was attended by the representatives of UNHCR, 
WFP, UNICEF, and WHO, the French ambassador and counsellor, 
the EU representative, the U.S. Charge d\'affaires, USAID 
representative, ADCM, and poloff.  The focus of the meeting 
was the Djibouti government\'s on-going expulsions of 
undocumented foreigners and consequent problems emerging from 
the newly-established \"transit center\" at Aouraoussa near the 
Ethiopian border in the district of Ali Sabieh. 
 
3.  UNHCR representative Collins Asare outlined the situation 
in Aouraoussa.  After the expulsion policy had been announced 
on July 26 and with little advance notice from the Djibouti 
government, UNHCR committed in mid-August to refurbishing 
this Mengistu-era transit center, which had fallen into 
disuse, to screen some 2500 asylum seekers whom it had 
registered in recent years.  Toward the end of August, the 
government gave UNHCR representatives 36 hours\' notice of 
implementation of a plan to move asylum seekers from Djibouti 
city to Aouraoussa.  On August 28 UNHCR staff found 
themselves surrounded by at least 10,000 people claiming 
asylum at the debarcation point in Djibouti city (a soccer 
stadium).  Citing concern that the crowd would become unruly, 
Djibouti authorities transported the entire group to the 
Aouraoussa transit center, which was prepared to handle 3,000 
people.  There arose numerous problems with security, 
logistics, and feeding.  At present, UN representatives said 
that that the primary concern was water.  WFP had committed 
to feeding the 12,000-15,000 people currently in the vicinity 
of the camp on a temporary basis, from its food stocks 
earmarked for the Djiboutian Food-for-Work and School-Feeding 
programs. 
 
4.  The UNHCR representative said that of the 12,000-15,000 
poeple at Aouraoussa, 2,500 (largely Oromo) were registered 
asylum seekers with UNHCR.  Approximately 5,000 people, he 
estimated on the basis of initial screening, were 
nonregistered southern Somalis who might have a claim to 
refugee status.  The remainder were nonregistered 
Somalilanders and Ethiopians, with a few others such as 
Eritreans, who would have little claim to refugee status.  He 
pointed out that UNHCR was suffering acute budgetary and 
human-resources constraints to cope with this influx of 
people, a significant portion of whom fell outside its 
purview.  He pointed out that the Djibouti governmental 
entity in charge of refugees was pressing for construction of 
permanent lodging and facilities at Aouraoussa. 
 
5.  The French ambassador expressed particular concern about 
the possible worsening of the situation in the coming days, 
with the ending of the \"grace period\" for voluntary departure 
of undocumented foreigners.  (The period was extended from 
August 31 to September 15 by the Minister of Interior, who 
declared that under no conditions would it be further 
extended.)  The U.S. Charge d\'affaires reviewed for the round 
table his demarche on the Minister of Interior September 3 
(reftel) and subsequent press guidance dissociating the U.S. 
from the expulsions and putting the government of Djibouti on 
notice in regard to human rights violations.  Discussants 
noted that several international journalists had indicated 
that they would be arriving in Djibouti in the coming days to 
cover the expulsions.  There was general agreement that the 
government of Djibouti would try to pass the blame for any 
future humanitarian crisis resulting from chaotic conditions 
at Aouraoussa or from forcible expulsions in coming weeks on 
to the international community.  All concurred that it would 
be important to provide a united front toward the Djibouti 
government to ensure that it accepted responsibility for a 
policy for which it alone was responsible.  It was agreed 
that the round table would reconvene September 16 to refine a 
concerted strategy. 
 
6.  Comment:  The Djibouti government would like to 
capitalize on its own self-inflicted policy of expulsions, 
its own lack of minimal preparation, and donors\' reluctance 
to permit suffering among a large undocumented population now 
on the move, to corner donors into creating yet another 
refugee camp, i.e., source of donor aid, on its borders.

REF: A) DJIBOUTI 1633 B) DJIBOUTI 1674 
 
Classified By: CONS/PD C.BEAMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (U) On July 26 Djiboutian Interior Minister Abdoulkader 
Wais announced that all undocumented foreigners must leave 
Djibouti by August 31, a deadline which was later extended to 
September 15.  According to Djiboutian security officials 180 
illegal aliens were seized in the Ambouli neighborhood of 
Djibouti city on September 16.  The illegals were to be held 
overnight and repatriated on September 17.  Sweeps continued 
on the 17th in the downtown market area of Djibouti.  80 
individuals were reportedly arrested on the 17th. 
International media present in Djibouti report that the 
sweeps took place in relative calm.  Media reports from 
unidentified Djiboutian government sources continue to 
portray the USG as the primary force behind the expulsion 
policy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE POLICY 
---------- 
 
2. (C) The July 26 announcement by the Djiboutian Government 
that all undocumented foreigners had 35 days to leave the 
country was followed by an intense public awareness campaign 
in the local state media.  The tone of Interior Minister 
Wais\'s public statements led everyone to believe that 
security forces were prepared to enforce this policy. 
Government officials cite security concerns, high 
unemployment, and public sanitation as their primary 
motivations for this policy but President Ismail Omar 
Guelleh\'s re-election campaign in 2005 is also an important 
factor.  Expulsion is seen as a way of providing jobs for the 
high numbers of unemployed in Djibouti that do not sense any 
trickle down from the recent economic boom brought on by the 
presence of coalition forces.  The \"cleaning up\" emphasis put 
on the expulsion campaign is being used to help Guelleh 
overcome the derisive nickname of \"President Poubelle\" 
(President Trash Can) he acquired as a result of the 
disintegration of public works and sanitation during his 
administration.  Djiboutian critics of the U.S. engagement in 
their country bolster their argument that the U.S. is behind 
the expulsion policy by pointing to the fact that both 
President Guelleh and Minister Wais are Ethiopian born and 
would not have the courage, power, nor will to enact this 
policy if the order did not come from the world super power. 
 
3. (C)  Small scale sweeps and repatriations in Djibouti city 
began as early as mid-August.  In late August, Wais extended 
the deadline to September 15 after several large 
demonstrations.  By early September the Djiboutian 
authorities reported that over 80,000 illegal aliens had left 
the country voluntarily.  Quantifying the statistical reports 
of departing illegals is difficult however as estimates range 
from 30-120,000.  Djiboutian League of Human Rights (LDDH) 
president, Jean-Paul Noel, reported two separate incidents in 
late August of repatriates dying in the open desert after 
having been deposited at the frontier by Djiboutian 
authorities without food or water.  Ethiopian exile 
opposition groups claim the expulsion is being used to target 
legitimate asylees for persecution and possible execution in 
Ethiopia.  Comment: While reports of such targeting are 
credible, we have no evidence it is taking place as part of 
the expulsion. 
 
THE REFUGEE GAME 
---------------- 
 
4. (C) On September 11 UNHCR authorities reported that 
roughly 15,000 people had descended upon a transit center 
built in the Ali Sabieh district to screen asylum seekers 
(see ref B).  A week before Minister Wais\'s July announcement 
UNHCR committed to refurbishing a Mengistu-era transit center 
in the southern district of Ali Sabieh to process 
approximately 2,500 asylum seekers (largely Ethiopian Oromo) 
that had been registered with the Djibouti office for nearly 
10 years.  In addition, the Djiboutian National Office for 
Refugees and Displaced persons (ONARS) had been delivering 
(comment: selling) asylee status cards in recent years to the 
tune of some 10,000.  Seeing an opportunity for aid (comment: 
and reportedly at the urging of Djiboutian authorities) 
thousands of individuals with and without various identity 
documents descended upon the ill prepared transit center in 
early September.  UNHCR Djibouti director W. Collins Asare 
reported that much of the problem stemmed from a rumor that 
individuals at this transit center were to be processed for 
relocation in Canada, the U.S., and Australia.  On September 
14, World Food Program logistics coordinator and security 
advisor Robert Gillenwater reported that the Government had 
cleared out the camp significantly and that WFP was providing 
a small emergency ration to individuals quitting the camp for 
foreign frontiers.  A UNHCR protection officer who preferred 
not to be named stated that he felt many of the individuals 
who departed the transit center were Djiboutians with ONARS 
asylee status who returned to Djibouti city when they 
realized there was no hope of being relocated to a third 
country. 
 
THE SWEEPS 
---------- 
 
5. (C) Speculation has abounded from the outset regarding the 
degree to which the Djiboutian authorities would pursue their 
expulsion policy.  LDDH published a white paper on September 
14 declaring that the entrance into private homes by security 
forces was unconstitutional and unacceptable.  The decree 
went on to quote Minister Wais as saying that \"our raids will 
be focused on suspected alien havens.\"  A Djiboutian police 
officer reported that the instructions they received from 
their chief, Hassan Djama, were \"you know where the 
non-Djiboutians live...go find them.\"  Security forces 
reportedly arrested 180 individuals in the Ambouli 
neighborhood on September 16 in pacific fashion.  BBC 
stringer Jonah Fisher reported that the sweeps had a staged 
effect as security forces videotaped themselves apprehending 
illegal aliens with extreme politeness. 
 
THE ECONOMY 
----------- 
 
6. (C) The short term impact of this policy is already being 
felt by every woman in Djibouti who is cooking and cleaning, 
frequently for the first time in her life.  The shortage of 
skilled and low wage laborers is hitting commercial and 
private sectors alike.  Long term however, the policy could 
go a long way in regularizing the Djiboutian employment 
market and prohibiting Djiboutian employers from exploiting 
their labor.  For this to be successful Djibouti will need to 
consider lowering its high public health and social security 
taxes on employers.  Neither system works efficiently and 
both workers and employers complain of the significant drain 
it places on them while accomplishing nothing. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) The atmosphere in Djibouti city is tense for the 
undocumented and the people who employ them as speculation 
continues on where the next round of sweeps will take place. 
The expulsions appear to be occurring in relative calm, 
however the LDDH did report that one individual was shot and 
killed in Ambouli on the 16th while fleeing from police. 
With that exception in mind, the significant international 
media attention on the ground seems to have focused the 
Djiboutian leadership\'s attention on restraining their 
security forces during the operations. 
 
8. (C) The ongoing effort by Djiboutian authorities to pass 
the responsibility for this Djiboutian policy to U.S. 
security interests is likely a result of internal domestic 
pressure.  Many of Djibouti\'s most powerful businessmen are 
suffering large losses as their labor costs rise and they 
attempt to train entire staffs.  Despite Post\'s public 
disassociation from the policy international media outlets 
(AFP, RFI, VOA, BBC) continue to feel the best story is the 
one leaked by Djiboutian authorities that the U.S. is behind 
the policy.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C)  The Djiboutian Government\'s announced expulsion order 
for all undocumented foreigners of August 31, later extended 
to September 15, brought to the surface the problem of asylum 
seekers currently in Djibouti.  The Djiboutian committee 
responsible with determining first asylum status has reviewed 
only 60 cases since 1995 and has not met in several years. 
UNHCR has some 2,500 registered asylum seekers (largely Oromo 
Ethiopians), and is dealing 
with an estimated 6-7,000 people located at the Aouraoussa 
transit center.  Djiboutian Interior Minister Abdoulkader 
Wais has told UN representatives that all of these 
individuals \"shall be treated as asylum seekers.\" 
Consequently, UN capacity and resources are being turned from 
program mandates to address this displacement crisis created 
by the Djiboutian Government.  The National Office for 
Refugees and Displaced Persons (ONARS), continues to siphon 
food and supplies to security forces.  WFP logistics officer 
Robert Gillenwater has been threatened with PNG status for 
his refusal to allow ONARS to divert resources and fears that 
the Government may escalate obstructionist tactics, 
potentially including impeding food transshipment to 
Ethiopia.  End Summary. 
 
Aouraoussa 
---------- 
 
2. (C) In late July upon confirmation from the Djiboutian 
Interior Minister that the asylum determination committee 
would reconvene and begin assigning status to claimants UNHCR 
agreed to recondition a transition center at Aouraoussa in 
the southern district of Ali Sabieh to process asylee claims. 
 On August 28 UNHCR and WFP received word from Djiboutian 
authorities that all asylees must be moved to the transit 
center within 36 hours.  They convened a temporary processing 
center at a Djiboutian soccer stadium and were descended upon 
by an estimated 10-15,000 people.  A decision was made by 
Djiboutian authorities for security reasons to forward all 
processing to the Aouraoussa transit center.  The transit 
center was built for a capacity of 2,500 to 3,000 and was 
incapable of dealing with the mass population that camped 
around it.  Initial estimates taken from head of households 
put the number of people at the camp at 12-15,000.  Minister 
Wais addressed the people at the transit center and asked 
that only genuine asylum seekers remain.  UNHCR rep. Collins 
Asare believes that 1,500-2,000 individuals have departed the 
transit center for foreign soil.  WFP has been providing 
one-week emergency food rations to those who leave 
voluntarily.  As time has gone on these individuals begin to 
realize they will not be receiving first world immigrant 
status or massive food aid 
packages.  UNHCR estimates that there are 6-7,000 people 
still clinging to the center. 
 
DONOR MEETING 
------------- 
 
3. (C) Donors (France, EU, U.S., UN agencies) met September 
24 to discuss the ongoing situation at Aouraoussa transit 
center.  UNHCR rep. Collins Asare communicated a government 
request for transport assistance to help move more people 
from the transit center to foreign frontiers.  The Djiboutian 
government rented Somaliland trucks for the departure of 
several hundred individuals but complained they could not 
afford more.  Asare complained that UNHCR did not have any 
more resources to spare and that it was in the donor interest 
to move these people now as opposed to feeding them later. 
The U.S. response was that we had already received and denied 
a Minister of the Interior request for assistance in this 
vein.  The E.U. response was that the Djiboutian military had 
plenty of vehicles if they really wanted to transport people. 
 The French response was that the Djiboutian government had 
not approached them, 
the Djiboutian government had plenty of resources to 
accomplish the task, and at most they would consider helping 
with fuel costs. 
 
4. (C)  WFP logistics officer and acting head, Robert 
Gillenwater, stated that he continued to battle with ONARS on 
food distribution to the transit center and existing refugee 
camps.  Gillenwater said that he confirmed his suspicions 
that food stocks were being diverted to security forces.  He 
feels that the ongoing practice has been to divert the extra 
food from the inflated numbers at the existing camps to 
security forces and reports that Djiboutian military and 
police officials have confirmed his theory.  He reports that 
he has cut assistance to ONARS and his efforts to build their 
capacity.  The Interior Minister has threatened him with PNG 
status.  In a separate meeting with officials from the 
Presidency Gillenwater reports the President is considering 
closing ONARS and establishing another government agency to 
handle these issues.  Gillenwater recommends using Crescent 
Rouge and building there capacity.  When questioned as to why 
WFP did not seek private contractors their transport and 
delivery services Gillenwater replied that he feared if he 
pushed the Government too far they would close their port to 
Ethiopian food aid. 
 
EXISTING CAMPS 
-------------- 
 
5. (C)  There have been ongoing debates about the actual 
number of refugees living in the two existing refugee camps 
at Ali Adde and Holl Holl. Officially, UNHCR statistics claim 
there are 21,000.  A 2002 repatriation goal of 12,000 people 
to Somaliland was set of which only 1,800 returned.  Thus far 
this year only 800 people have been repatriated.  The Asian 
Medical Doctors Association (AMDA), charged with providing 
medical treatment for camp residents, report that they treat 
between 4-6,000 refugees per month and consistently see the 
same people.  Numerous credible sources (including Conoff) 
have visited the camps and believe it possible that there are 
more than 10-12,000 refugees living in the existing camps. 
It is possible that many of the registered refugees return to 
the camps to collect their food stipends but live elsewhere. 
The community refugee representative at the Holl Holl camp is 
a sitting deputy in the Somaliland Parliament. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C)  It seems the Djiboutian Government is coming closer 
to realizing its objective of a third refugee \"camp\" in 
Aouraoussa.  There remain a significant number of individuals 
in the camp who are of dubious eligibility for asylum status 
but who have apparently been anointed asylum seekers by the 
Minister of the Interior.  It will take a strong stance from 
UNHCR and other UN agencies to counter this effort.  UNHCR 
Director Asare is, however, new and has been asked to carry 
out a wide range of tasks including clearing his office of 
corruption, jump starting a dead repatriation process, and 
now handling a significant new caseload.  Djiboutian 
authorities are pressing both the UNHCR and the WFP hard with 
a sometimes explicit threat of expulsion for those who do not 
cooperate. 
 
7. (C)  In fact, most of the food aid for Djibouti reaches 
its intended recipients, but that is due to the hard line set 
down by the WFP staff in Djibouti who will not accept 
misallocations.  Post intends to support the WFP position 
with the Djiboutian government.  While Gillenwater may be in 
some risk of expulsion, we feel it highly unlikely that the 
Djiboutian Government would risk its growing Port business 
and commercial goodwill with an action so rash and 
counterproductive as shutting off the flow of  Ethiopian food 
aid.

------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: AmEmbassy Djibouti representatives 
received Somaliland requests for counterterrorism assistance 
in a brief meeting with the the secessionist region\'s 
Ministers of Defense, Interior, and Rehabilitation and 
Returning Refugees  September 29, 2003.  The Embassy 
reiterated the USG position of recognizing a unified Somalia, 
but promised to forward the group\'s information to 
Washington.  The Somaliland officials said the Djiboutian 
Foreign Ministry had afforded them better treatment on this 
visit, granting them visas, limousine service and announcing 
them by title and their visit in the official media. End 
Summary. 
 
 
SOMALILAND MAKES ITS CASE FOR USG ASSISTANCE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) CDA Smith, accompanied by visiting AF/E Desk 
Officer Nole Garey, met briefly with Minister of the Interior 
Ismael Adam Osman, Minister of Defense Ismail Omar Adan, and 
Minister of Rehabilitation and Refugees M. Abdoulahi Iman of 
the self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland at the Sheraton 
Hotel on September 29, 2003.  The Ministers presented the 
Charge with several documents, including a brochure from 
their Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a paper entitled 
\"Somaliland\'s Mission for Collaboration with the 
International Anti-Terrorist Activities.\"  These materials 
argued the case for international recognition of the 
breakaway republic and included a request for 
counter-terrorism assistance. 
 
3.  (SBU) Abdullah Hussain Iman, the Minister for 
Rehabilitation and Returning Refugees, cited article 10 dash 
7 in the Somaliland constitution which condemns all acts of 
terrorism, avowing that the government and people of 
Somaliland are categorically opposed to all acts of 
terrorism.  Iman decried the lawlessness that has existed in 
Somalia since the end of the Siad Barre regime and the 
potential use of Somalia by individuals associated with 
terrorist organizations.  He emphasized the danger in the 
area of Puntland in Northeast Somalia, described Abdillahi 
Yusuf as a \"warlord\", and requested US military help to fight 
the recurrent piracy along the Somali coast. (Note: Puntland 
has a territorial dispute with Somaliland over two 
provinces.) 
 
4. (SBU) Iman recalled the use of the Naval Base in Berbera 
by the United States Navy during the Barre regime, expressing 
the desire to reestablish a military relationship with the 
USG. 
 
5. (SBU) Iman described the meeting as a goodwill effort to 
establish peace and stability in Somaliland.  He noted that 
the Somaliland navy consists of only two boats, while the 
length of the coast of Somaliland is 750 kilometers, much too 
long for their navy to control.  Iman added that Somaliland 
had been cooperating with the Government of Ethiopia in 
anti-terrorism activities since 2000, and expressed the wish 
to cooperate with both French and U.S. military forces in 
Djibouti against terrorist activities in the region. 
 
6. (SBU) Smith reiterated the USG position of recognizing a 
unified Somalia.  He promised to share the information 
discussed in the meeting with Washington.  The Ministers 
expressed their appreciation for the meeting and confirmed 
their understanding that there had been no change in U.S. 
policy towards Somaliland. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT: The most interesting new information 
gleaned from the meeting was the behavior of the Government 
of Djibouti (GoDj) towards Somaliland.  During the meeting, 
the Ministers showed off their new Somaliland passports with 
Djiboutian visas.  The Ministers said these passports were 
issued to only Government of Somaliland officials.  The group 
was given VIP treatment and recognized as Ministers (of a 
self-proclaimed republic) for the first time on this trip. 
This suggests a change in the official Djiboutian attitude 
towards Somaliland. END COMMENT.

1. (S) On 4 October 2003 about 1400 hours, the Embassy 
received threat information indicating that a Protestant 
church in the down town area of Djibouti was targeted for a 
bomb attack on that same evening.  Notifications were 
immediately made to all appropriate authorities and the 
Embassy issued a warden notice to the community identifying 
the potential threat. 
 
2.  (S) On 4 October 2003 about 1400 hours, Major Patrick 
Anderson, Embassy US Liaison Officer, received threat 
information from an American citizen stating that the 
Protestant church located in the downtown area of Djibouti 
was to be targeted for a terrorist attack.  The American 
citizen was approached by a Djiboutian national who is known 
to attend religious services at the church.  The Djiboutian 
national, only known as Kadir, stated that he had been 
approached by two men, only known as Guelleh and A\'amadi, to 
place a bomb in the church on the evening of 4 October 2003 
during the religious service.  Kadir, states that he 
immediately refused to carry out their requests.  No other 
information was given or sought.  The American citizen 
immediately notified the church\'s French Pastor who in turn 
notified church members. 
 
3.  (S) Upon notification of the threat, the Charge\' 
d\'Affaires (CDA) directed the USLO to gather more information 
from the source.  An interview was scheduled with Kadir on 5 
October 2003 between the hours of 0900 and 0930, but Kadir 
never showed up at the Embassy.  COS notified Host Nation 
security Services and is working closely with them to follow 
up on the alleged threat.  CDA drafted a warden notice and 
conferred with the Department on the issuance and language of 
the notice prior to release.  RSO returned from leave on the 
morning of 5 October 2003 and was notified upon arrival to 
his residence. 
 
4. (S) The information received is inconclusive, non-credible 
and sketchy at best.  RSO and COS will continue to work 
closely with Host Nation counterparts to follow any 
developments, but both officers believe that the validity of 
the source\'s information, as relayed to the American citizen, 
is highly improbable.  Without further details from the 
source the information should only be considered as hearsay 
from a third party.  RSO will notify the Department 
immediately if any leads are developed.

AGRICULTURE IS NOT DEVELOPED AND REPRESENTS LESS THAN ONE

2. POST MET WITH THE MINISTRY OF TRADE AUTHORITIES IN 
CHARGE OF COMMERCIAL FOOD REGULATIONS, QUALITY CONTROL 
AND LABELING. THE MINISTRY OF TRADE CONFIRMED THAT THERE 
ARE NO LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE LABELING OF 
BIOTECH PRODUCTS.  NO SPECIAL LABELING IS REQUIRED FOR 
BIOTECH PRODUCTS. 
 
3. THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURAL INDICATED AS WELL THAT NO 
LAWS OR REGULATIONS ARE IN PLACE FOR BIOTECH CROPS. 
OFFICIALS AT THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURAL CLAIMED TO BE 
KNOWLEDGEABLE, AT LEAST IN THEORY, ABOUT BIOTECH CROPS. 
THEY INSIST LOCAL FARMERS ARE NOT READY FOR GMO SEEDS 
BECAUSE FARMING IN DJIBOUTI IS STILL AT A RUDIMENTARY

LOCAL SEEDS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF BIOTECH CROP

4.  FOOD AID IS PROVIDED TO OVER TWENTY THOUSAND REFUGEES 
HOSTED BY DJIBOUTI.  THESE REFUGEES COME FROM SOMALIA, 
ETHIOPIA, ERYTREA AND YEMEN.  THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME 
(WFP), IN COORDINATION WITH THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR, 
PROVIDES FOOD DONATIONS FOR CAMPS BUT DOES NOT  BAN OR 
REGULATE BIOTECH FOOD AID.  DJIBOUTIAN OFFICIALS DO NOT 
SEEM AWARE WHETHER OR NOT GMO FOOD AID IS BEING DONATED 
TO THE REFUGEES. 
 
5.  Comment: All concerned Djiboutian ministries 
confirmed that there are no existing laws or regulations 
restricting the use of biotech food or GMO products. 
However, Post notes that officials from the above- 
mentioned ministries are not comfortable with biotech 
food, and many stated personal opposition to them.  They 
echo French and European concerns about the implications 
that genetically modified food might have on human 
health.  They also worry that GMO seed might somehow 
contaminate the local varieties.  Despite this general 
negativity, Post sees no signs the host government will 
enact laws or regulations on the subject matter in the 
near future.

-------------------------------- 
 
A. Narrative Overview of Significant Events 
 
1. (U) RSO continues to manage a very intensive portfolio 
with little to no assistance.  As the mission continues to 
expand the need for security services increases, but the 
security section remains the same.  Post has gone from 8 
direct hire Americans to a current staff of 15 with 7 long 
term TDYers and a projected staff of 20 by the spring of 
2004, all of which need security services in one form or 
another. 
 
2. (U) From 10/19 to 10/27, RSO participated in the 
International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) 
conference located in Philadelphia.  RSO accompanied the 
chief of the Djibouti National Police Force, as one of 6 
personal invitees of Ambassador Taylor. 
 
In addition to the IACP conference, RSO participated in 
several visits to Post: 
 
-     10/12 to 10/14 Visit of AF/EX PMO Ray Maxwell 
-     10/29 to 11/03 - STS Jack McKenna to repair technical 
security equipment.  Post continues to suffer 
from technical malfunctions of its Lock & Leave systems.  RSO 
is working closely with SEO Addis to address technical issues 
as they arise. 
-     11/02 - Visit of USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios 
-     11/04 - Visit of ORA RMO Dr. Allen Ries 
-     11/14 to 11/19 - DS/MSD/MTT Training Visit 
-     11/28 to 12/02 - DS/FSE/FSB X-Ray team

3. (U) RSO has not received any reports of attacks on 
Americans during this quarter. As reported before, RSO and 
embassy personnel continue to monitor crime trends and RSO 
continues to work closely with host nation police to ensure 
the safety of all personnel. Reports of petty theft, fraud, 
assault, battery, sexual deviation, and unlawful trade 
continue to be reported informally, but host nation police 
forces continue to report that crime is decreasing. 
 
4. (U) RSO is working closely with DS/ATA in coordinating law 
enforcement training for local security personnel. One ATA 
course was successfully completed and 2 more courses were 
offered during the 4th quarter. 
 
5. (U) RSO supported the visit of the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs General Richard Myers and several other sub CINC 
visits of military personnel during this quarter. RSO 
continues to work closely with and support Other agencies at 
post to coordinate visits and security Briefings.

trans-national terrorism. RSO continues to work closely with

physical security measures surrounding the embassy in 
response to that activity.  Post received an additional 
130,000.00USD at the end of the fiscal year to supplement the 
physical security of the perimeter.  RSO is working closely 
with GSO to acquire the materials and implement the 
countermeasures as fast as possible.

I. ACEQ - 
 
1.  (SBU) Crime Mobility - response (c). 
 
Comments: Although criminals have easy access to embassy 
residential areas, there have been no reports of theft, 
burglary or other crimes against Americans in the past six 
months. The 24hr local guard coverage is acting as an 
excellent deterrent. 
 
2. (SBU) Crime Ambience - response (b). 
 
Comments: Due to the proximity of the high crime port area, 
just 1 mile from the embassy residential area, the potential 
for criminal activity especially at night still exists. 
Physical security measures coupled with 24hr guard coverage 
has helped deter would be burglars.  Post has acquired new 
housing within an area of the city that is farther away from 
the upper scale district of Heron.  Not enough time has 
passed to adequately survey the impact of criminal activity 
towards these residences.  Should criminal activity begin to 
surface in this area RSO will report accordingly. 
 
3. (U) Aggressiveness of Criminals - response (b). 
 
Comments: Due to the habitual use of the amphetamine Khat, by 
the majority of the male populace, the potential for 
aggressive behavior on behalf of the criminal could be 
exhibited, but no reports have been submitted that document 
such behavior. 
 
4. (U) Arming of Criminals - response (b). 
 
Comments: Violent crimes involving firearms are rare, but the 
presence of firearms is becoming more prevalent due to the 
porous borders between Djibouti, Somalia, Ethiopia and 
Eritrea. Knives and sharp objects seem to be the weapon of 
choice for the would be assailant. 
 
5. (U) Aggregation of Criminals - response (b). 
 
Comments: Criminals generally aggregate by ethnic 
affiliation, clanship or tribalism. Incidents in the past 
indicate that victims are spared gratuitous violence if they 
comply with the perpetrators. 
 
6. (SBU) Deterrence/Response of Police - response (c). 
 
Comments: The national police force is under trained, under 
resourced and under paid. They lack sufficient and adequate 
equipment and do not have the budget, experience or knowledge 
to effectively combat crime. The local criminal sees this and 
is not deterred by the presence or actions of the police. 
Embassy officers rely on the RSO and LGF to respond to any 
incident that may occur at their residences. 
 
7. (SBU) Training/Professionalism of Police - response (d). 
 
Comments: It has been three years since the attempted, but 
failed, coup was carried out against the current president. 
The police forces have appeared to bounce back and are in the 
daily process of carrying out their duties.  RSO works 
closely with senior level police on a weekly basis and 
believes that a concerted effort to change the past is being 
made. The lower levels of police officers still suffer from 
low salaries, virtually no benefits, poor equipment and 
inadequate training. In FY-03, DS/ATA provided the government 
of Djibouti with a series of courses that are designed to 
enhance the law enforcement capabilities of their security 
services.  The ATA program continues to evolve for Djibouti 
in FY-04. 
 
J. OSAC/CSR - 
 
1. (U) Overall crime and safety situation:  the State 
Department,s Bureau of Diplomatic Security rates Djibouti as 
a high crime threat post.  Endemic poverty, widespread 
unemployment and a growing refugee population have led to an 
increase in criminal activity over the past several years. 
Most reported incidents are crimes of opportunity for 
immediate gain such as pick-pocketing and petty theft. 
Violent crimes committed at knifepoint, are also reported but 
not common.  There have been burglary attempts against 
expatriate residences, but perpetrators generally lack the 
sophistication required to 
Overcome home alarm systems and security guards.  The large 
number of unemployed males loitering downtown and in other 
areas frequented by expatriates allows criminals to roam 
undetected.  The port, bus terminal and downtown areas of 
Djibouti are considered at greatest risk for street crime. 
Criminal activity is exacerbated by the widespread abuse of 
Khat, an amphetamine that tends to increase aggressiveness 
among users. 
 
2. (U) Political violence:  The government and community 
leaders have stated publicly their strong support for the 
U.S. and coalition efforts in the Global War on Terrorism 
and.  Although anti U.S. demonstrations broke out at the 
beginning of the Iraqi conflict, the focus of the 
demonstrations was aimed at the war and not Americans 
overall.  The demonstrations lasted approximately 5 days, but 
there have been no signs since of anti-American sentiment. 
65 percent of Djiboutians are ethnic Somalis, and the rest 
are afar or foreigners. 
 
Domestic political violence is a less significant threat than 
during the civil war (1990-1996), but rivalry persists 
between Djibouti,s Somali and Afar ethnic groups.  Since the 
may 2001 signing of a peace accord, many former rebels have 
been integrated into the National Police and Defense Forces. 
Demonstrations, often protesting against the Government,s 
nonpayment of salaries, sometimes take place and police 
occasionally use non-lethal force to disperse unauthorized 
demonstrators.  Civil unrest could also result If the daily 
air delivery of Khat from neighboring countries were 
disrupted or delayed for any reason.  Visitors are advised to 
avoid political gatherings and large crowds. 
 
Djibouti lies at the crossroads between the middle east and 
the horn of Africa and hosts a substantial population of 
refugees from throughout the region.  The governments of 
Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Russia, 
China, France, The United States and other nations maintain 
diplomatic or honorary representation in Djibouti. 
Djibouti,s proximity to a number of conflict-torn states and 
the governments limited capacity to monitor border controls 
has raised concerns over the possibility of cross-border 
terrorist acts. 
 
3. (U) Post-specific safety concerns: 
 
Road travel to the north of the country is considered unsafe 
due to poorly constructed roads and the lack of service or 
emergency stations. 
 
A significant percentage of Djiboutian males are under the 
influence of Khat on a daily basis.  The drugs effects may 
escalate what would otherwise be a casual interaction (such 
as a bumped elbow) into a confrontation. 
 
Djibouti is an Islamic country; visitors should dress 
conservatively and observe local customs. 
 
4. (U) Police response:  The Djiboutian National Police Force 
is severely under resourced.  The police lack transportation, 
fuel, and communications equipment, which severely affects 
Police responsiveness.  The government is generally 3-6 
months in arrears for payment of police salaries.  In 
addition, the Government will be forced to reduce its Police 
Force by 40% in 2004 in order to meet economic demands. 
 
Visitors requiring police assistance are advised to appear in 
person at the commissariat of police, located across from the 
general post office on the Boulevard de la Republique.  The 
central police telephone number is 352-343.  Private security 
guards for residences and facilities are generally hired on 
an ad-hoc basis.  There are few security guard companies, 
none that are capable of providing patrol response services. 
 
5. (U) Medical emergencies:  Local medical facilities do not 
generally offer standards of care available in western 
countries, although there are a few French-trained doctors 
who cater to the expatriate community.  Visitors with medical 
problems are advised to contact the hospital Bouffard (French 
Military hospital) at 351-351 ext.53015. 
 
Falciparum-type malaria (chloroquine-resistant) is widespread 
in Djibouti; prophylaxis is advised. 
 
HIV/AIDS is also a serious concern, especially among the 
urban population; approximately 12 percent of all Djiboutians 
are infected. 
 
6. (U) Tips to avoid being a victim: 
 
a) Street Safety:  Visitors to Djibouti should remain 
vigilant at all times and maintain a high security awareness 
while on the streets.  Additional caution should be exercised 
around the port, bus terminal, central market (Quartiers 2 
and 3) and downtown, especially after dark.  Panhandlers and 
street children target foreigners for petty theft by creating 
distractions.  Visitors should Avoid isolated areas, 
particularly along the urban coastline. 
b) Traffic Safety:  road conditions are poor throughout 
Djibouti.  Drivers should beware of potholes, unskilled 
drivers, and the presence of non-roadworthy vehicles on urban 
and rural roads.  Pedestrians and livestock often appear on 
roadways without warning.  Reports indicate that nomads in 
rural areas place rocks on the roads to stop vehicles and 
demand water and/or transportation.  The theft of high-value 
items from stopped vehicles has been reported.  Drivers 
should keep their windows up and doors locked and are 
especially vigilant at intersections. Unattended vehicles 
should always be locked, with valuables secured in an 
inconspicuous location. 
 
Visitors who are involved in traffic accidents should attempt 
to exchange insurance information with the other party and 
summon a traffic policeman if one is nearby.  It is 
inadvisable to make restitution at the scene, especially if 
livestock or pedestrians are involved.  Drivers should be 
weary of crowds gathering at the scene of an accident and 
should depart immediately if they perceive a threat to their 
Safety. 
 
c) Hotel Safety:  US Government personnel on temporary 
assignment to Djibouti are advised to stay in one of four 
hotels:  The Sheraton, The Plen Cielle, The Bellevue and The 
Europa.  Other hotels are considered inadequate.  Visitors 
have reported incidents of robbery and aggressive 
solicitation by prostitutes.  Visitors are advised to lock 
their doors and admit only expected visitors into hotel rooms. 
 
7. (U) Further information:  There is no OSAC country council 
in Djibouti.  American citizens are encouraged to register 
with the embassy by appearing in person at the Consular 
section. The embassy is located on Avenue Marechal Joffre at 
the Plateau du Serpent (near the Sheraton hotel). Business 
hours are 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Sunday through Thursday. 
Telephone numbers are (253) 353-995.  Americans are welcome 
to visit the consular section any time during business hours 
or to telephone the embassy 24 hours a day in case of an 
emergency.

SUBJECT: SUMMARY OF DECEMBER ACTIVITIES AT AMEMBASSY 
DJIBOUTI 
 
SUMMARY: (U) This is a summary of the activities at Embassy 
Djibouti for the month of December. 
 
DJIBOUTI-SOMALIA RELATIONS 
--------------- 
      Charge Tim Smith, AF/E Deputy Director Phil Carter and 
POLoff Erinn Reed met with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Secretary for Bilateral Relations, Miriam Gumaneh, regarding 
 
SIPDIS 
the Djibouti-Somalia relations, as well as, the current state 
of Djibouti-U.S. relations.  Ms. Gumaneh described the 
actions of the Djiboutian government in the peace process for 
Somalia. Both parties agreed that Djibouti,s role was 
important. Ms. Gumaneh stressed that Somalia needs to make 
its own agreement, but that Djibouti would be willing to act 
as a facilitator. 
Mr. Carter assured Ms. Gumaneh that the U.S. position on 
Somalia was the same and questioned the feasibility of the 
process if the TNG did not participate. Mr. Carter addressed 
the U.S. stance on Somaliland/Somalia separation, saying that 
we would like to see the Somaliland region stay stable.  He 
also stated that if the peace conference was a failure, the 
U.S. would have to rethink the policy on separation, but 
would follow the lead of the African Union. Ms. Gumaneh 
stated that if the two agreed to separate amicably, the 
African Union would support it. 
 
IMF PANEL VISIT 
--------------- 
      The International Monetary Fund sent a panel of 
delegates to take stock of the program\'s progress.  The panel 
met with Charge Tim Smith and POLOFF Erinn Reed at the 
Embassy December 10, 2003 to inquire about the monies given 
to the Djiboutian government by the U.S. Their main task was 
to reconcile the amount that the 2003 and 2004 Djiboutian 
budgets showed with the amounts reported from the U.S. 
organizations. The members of the IMF panel made it known to 
the Charge and the POLoff that Djibouti would need to show a 
strong track record in economic policy over the next years if 
it were to receive another IMF program. 
      The panel\'s visit ended with a Donors, meeting on 
December 13, 2003 to discuss the progress and plan for the 
IMF presence in Djibouti. POLoff Erinn Reed and the Econ 
Assistant attended the meeting.  The meeting was focused on 
the implementation of a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) and a 
review of the Djiboutian economic budget.  The SMP is to be 
the mechanism through which the Djiboutian government can 
build a track record, after which the IMF will consider 
whether the country is sufficiently dedicated to policy 
reform to receive a Fund Financial Arrangement. The 
governments actions will be closely monitored by a permanent 
representative from the IMF here in Djibouti and several 
Article IV consultations. 
 
DJIBOUTIAN OFFICIALS VISIT TO IRAN 
------------- 
      President Ismail Omar Guelleh and several cabinet 
officials made a state visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran 
(IRI).  The agenda was discussions of increased cooperation 
between the two governments.  The IRI and Djibouti signed a 
number of memoranda on cooperation in the economic, 
industrial and mining sectors. The agreements emphasized the 
need for broadening the economic ties between the two 
countries, private and government sectors.  Several programs 
to aid the Republic of Djibouti were also granted. A loan was 
granted for building a new office for the Djiboutian National 
Assembly and a commercial center.  The Iranian Red Cross also 
promised to help in Djibouti\'s health program.   In the 
education domain, Iran promised to grant scholarships to 
students majoring in computer science. 
Discussions also included the African continent\'s conflicts, 
fighting and crisis.  President Khatami complimented 
President Guelleh,s effort in restoring of peace and 
stability in Somalia. 
The two parties condemned the atrocities and violence of 
Sharon\'s government against Palestinian people.  They also 
condemned those who try to distort the image of Islam. They 
also lashed out at any act of terrorism. 
On Iraq issues, they reaffirmed the need to preserve Iraq\'s 
territorial integrity, national unity and called for 
withdrawal of occupiers from the country and led the people 
govern their own country. 
The two leaders called for peaceful application of nuclear 
technology for all members of the NPT. 
 
EXXON MOBIL\'S CLAIM AGAINST THE DJIBOUTIAN JUDICIARY 
------------- 
      This situation is ongoing; a full reporting cable will 
be submitted after the Djiboutian government takes action. 
In brief, the three major oil companies in Djibouti ) 
ExxonMobil, Shell and Total ) have several lawsuits pending 
in the courts. Fines have been tallied against the companies 
based on blatantly altered documents overturning previous 
appeals. The exemplars given to the Charge, in a meeting with 
ExxonMobil representative Alain Adam on December 10, 2003, 
showed portions of previous court documents whited-out and 
altered to reverse the decisions. 
      After visiting the Ministers of Justice and of the 
Presidency, the Government of Djibouti (GoD) has not taken 
any action other than to say there would be an investigation 
done internally at the Ministry of Justice.  The attitude of 
the GoD is that this is a very serious issue and they would 
remedy it.  However, in a meeting December 22, 2003 the 
Minister of the Presidency in charge of foreign investment 
seemed disinterested and the impression was that this problem 
would not be immediately fixed. 
      Embassy Djibouti has been reluctant to submit the 
National Trade Estimate reporting cable as a result of this 
flagrant misuse of justice. This suit would cause a severely 
negative change to the NTE if included. Embassy Djibouti 
relayed this fact to the Minister of the Presidency Osman, 
indicating that if no immediate action were taken to remedy 
this case there would be significant potential damage to the 
impression of the transparency of the government and the 
judiciary. Minister Osman replied that if we reported so 
negatively in this document we would be punishing the entire 
country for the actions of individuals. 
 
JOINT CHIEFS/ROBIN WILLIAMS, VISIT TO CAMP LEMONIER ON RTD 
------------ 
      Embassy Djibouti provided footage, photos and a press 
release to Radio-TV Djibouti of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff/Robin Williams USO Christmas visit to Camp Lemonier. 
RTD aired a full three minutes of footage with staging that 
included the American Flag and a presentation to Williams by 
General Robeson. Response has been positive from the 
Djiboutian public.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, ECON, EFIN, KPAO, DJ 
SUBJECT: SUMMARY OF DECEMBER ACTIVITIES AT U.S. 
EMBASSY DJIBOUTI 
 
1. (U) A review of items of interest in 
Djibouti for the month of December follows. 
 
DJIBOUTI-SOMALIA RELATIONS 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary for 
Bilateral Relations Miriam Goumaneh updated visiting AF/E 
Deputy Director Phil Carter and Political Officer Erinn 
Reed on Djibouti-Somalia relations, as well as the 
Djiboutian Foreign Ministry perspective on relations with 
the U.S. on December 9.  Goumaneh described recent 
actions by the Djiboutian government -- such as 
withdrawing from then almost immediately returning to 
Somali peace talks in Kenya -- as consistent with the 
long-term goal of establishing a peaceful Somalia. Carter 
agreed that Djibouti had played an important role and was 
well placed to continue being a positive influence on the 
process. Goumaneh stressed that Somalis needed to reach 
their own agreement and that it could not be imposed from 
the outside, but she believes Djibouti can act as a good- 
faith facilitator among the many factions. 
 
3. (SBU) Carter assured Goumaneh that the U.S. shared the 
same goals for Somalia but questioned the feasibility of 
a process without TNG participation.  He added that if 
the present peace conference failed, the U.S. would have 
to rethink the policy on engagement with Somaliland.  In 
any case, the U.S. would continue to follow the lead of 
the African Union policy in recognizing a secession if 
and when all sides directly concerned agreed to separate 
amicably. 
 
IMF TEAM VISIT 
-------------- 
 
4. (SBU) An International Monetary Fund team headed by 
Ugo Fasano, Deputy Division Chief, ended its visit with a 
donors\' meeting on December 13, 2003.  POLOFF Erinn Reed 
and Econ Assistant Abdi Mahmoud attended the meeting 
which focused on the implementation of a Staff-Monitored 
Program (SMP) following the failure to fully implement 
economic reforms that accompanied the three-year poverty 
reduction and growth facility (PRGF) which expired in 
January 2003.  The team reviewed the Djiboutian 2003 and 
2004 budget and economic model and also focused on 
international competitiveness. 
 
5. (SBU) During an earlier meeting with CDA Smith on 
December 10, 2003, the team inquired about the monies 
given to the Djiboutian government by the U.S. They found 
it hard to reconcile amounts in the 2003 and 2004 
Djiboutian budgets with the amounts reported by the USG 
and other donors. The group believes Djibouti has a ways 
to go before it has a strong enough track record to merit 
another formal IMF program.  If they choose to, the 
Djiboutians can use the SMP as an opportunity to prove to 
the IMF they are sufficiently dedicated to policy reform 
to receive a new agreement. The permanent representative 
from the IMF in Djibouti and several follow-on Article IV 
consultations will show whether the political will is 
really there. 
 
6. (SBU) The IMF and other donors are critical of 
increased U.S. and French payments for military services. 
They believe these increases in funds available to the 
government of Djibouti have relieved the pressure to 
reduce government expenditures, especially the need to 
reduce public employees.  During the two formal meetings 
as well as during two informal meals, the IMF team had 
the opportunity to review (and defend) some of their 
stock policy recommendations, particularly currency 
devaluation.  The critique was that removing the 176.95 
Djiboutian Franc to the U.S. dollar peg that has held 
since 1947 would not increase productivity.  With no 
agriculture and no manufactures, Djibouti has only port 
and military services as foreign exchange earners. 
Neither of these is price sensitive.  Some argued that 
with Djibouti\'s totally non-elastic productive center, a 
devaluation would only increase poverty and suffering. 
 
DJIBOUTIAN OFFICIALS VISIT IRAN 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) President Ismail Omar Guelleh and several cabinet 
officials made a state visit to the Islamic Republic of 
Iran (IRI).  Subsequent public announcement stressed 
increased cooperation between the two governments, 
including a number of agreements in the economic, 
industrial and mining sectors. Specific aid to Djibouti 
included a loan for building a new office for the 
Djiboutian National Assembly and a commercial center. 
The Iranian Red Crescent promised to help in Djibouti\'s 
health program and in the education domain.  Iran also 
promised scholarships to students majoring in computer 
science. 
 
8. (U) Political discussions covered the African 
continent\'s conflicts and crises.  President Khatami 
complimented Guelleh\'s effort to restore peace and 
stability in Somalia while the two parties condemned the 
atrocities and violence of the \"Zionist government of 
Sharon\" against the Palestinian people.  They also 
condemned those who try to distort the image of Islam and 
lashed out against all acts of terrorism.  On Iraq 
issues, the two countries reaffirmed the need to preserve 
Iraq\'s territorial integrity, national unity and called 
for withdrawal of \"occupiers\" to allow the people of Iraq 
to govern their own country.   The two leaders called for 
peaceful application of nuclear technology for all 
members of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
 
EXXON MOBIL\'S CLAIM AGAINST THE DJIBOUTIAN JUDICIARY 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
9.  (SBU) The three major Western oil companies operating 
in Djibouti - ExxonMobil, Shell and Total - are defending 
themselves in several lawsuits brought forth by the 
Government of Djibouti. ExxonMobil has written to the 
Embassy complaining that fines have been tallied against 
them based on blatantly altered documents overturning 
previous appeals. Evidence to support this charge was 
given to the Charge in a meeting with ExxonMobil 
representative Alain Adam on December 10, 2003.  The 
Charge visited the Minister of Justice and was promised 
immediate action but since a follow-up visit with the 
Minister of the Presidency in charge of Foreign 
Investment on December 22, we have heard nothing. 
 
10.  (SBU) As soon as we receive a reaction on this 
issue, we will incorporate it in our National Trade 
Estimate reporting cable.  Depending on the response, 
this incident might severely affect Djibouti\'s reputation 
with the international business community.  We expect the 
Government will respond within the next several days, but 
we are not heartened by Minister of the Presidency 
Osman\'s plea we \"not punish the entire country for the 
actions of a few individuals.\" 
 
JOINT CHIEFS/ROBIN WILLIAMS\' VISIT TO CAMP LEMONIER ON 
RTD 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
11. (SBU) Embassy Djibouti\'s PAO Tiffany Bartish provided 
footage, photos and a press release to Radio-TV Djibouti 
(RTD) of the Robin Williams USO Christmas visit to Camp 
Lemonier. RTD aired a full three minutes of footage that 
included the American Flag and a presentation to Williams 
of a man-skirt and a cow skull (a symbol of the Horn of 
Africa). Response has been positive from the Djiboutian 
public who might not have enjoyed some of William\'s 
comments about the locale -- \"Not the end of the earth, 
but you can see it from here!\"   PAO Bartish ensured 
neither these nor Mr. Williams\' bluer comments were on 
the tape. 
 
OBO NEW EMBASSY COMPOUND SITE SELECTION TEAM FINDS THREE 
POSSIBILITIES 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
12. (U) Post hosted an OBO site selection committee 
headed by Thomas Grubb December 14 through 18.  Three 
possible sites were found.  All are within a kilometer of 
each other about half way between the present site in 
downtown Djibouti and the airport and Camp Lemonier. 
 
FOOD AID CUT TO DJIBOUTI-BASED REFUGEES TO FORCE REFORMS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
13. (SBU) USAID\'s REDSO office out of Nairobi has 
temporarily cut off U.S. food assistance for refugees to 
force the Djiboutian refugee offices to reform their 
operations, stop diversion of food assistance to security 
forces and kick start the almost moribund program of 
repatriation of Somalis from Somaliland.  Following up on 
03 Nairobi 5355, we believe that the cancellation of 
shipments for December and January will result in a re- 
organization of the Djiboutian refugee office ONARS. 
 
14. (SBU) This coordinated tough love for the Djiboutian 
government seems to be working.  First put in place in 
September when the U.S. and UN provided a common front on 
not supporting a new refugee camp made of formerly 
clandestine workers, the new step initiated by World Food 
Program officer Robert Gillenwater has already helped 
focus GoDj attention at the highest levels on the need to 
reform the refugee program.  Gillenwater and UNHCR 
representative Collins Asare expect a new proposal from 
the Djiboutians in mid-January which will allow USAID to 
resume shipments.  These would arrive in March or April 
and not effect actual food distribution to the refugees.

Classified By: RSO Marc Ramos for Reason 1.5 (D) AND (G) 
 
1. (C) Post held an executive meeting of the Emergency Action 
Committee on 01/10/2004 to discuss recent threat activity in 
the region and what measures to take in response to a 
particular threat.  The executive EAC was composed of the 
Charge\' d\'Affaires, RSO, COS, USLO and Consular Officer. 
 
2. (C) The EAC discussed potential threats as outlined in 
recent intelligence reports.  RSO and COS continue to work 
closely with Host Nation and US Military counterparts to 
mitigate any threat, but the EAC does not feel at this time 
that an increase in security services is needed.  US Military 
personnel continue to take appropriate measures in accordance 
with their standard operating procedures. 
 
3. (C) In light of recent intelligence, the EAC reviewed 
current Trip Wires for Post and updated them accordingly. 
Due to Post\'s small size and its unique situation, (having a 
US Military base less than a 10 minute drive from the 
Embassy) the EAC adjusted the levels and actions taking into 
consideration the ability of the US Military to assist in a 
crisis situation.  Listed below is a break down of levels and 
actions that Post will use as a guide to respond to an 
emergency situation.  This model has been taken from the Trip 
Wires Guidance published by the Office of Crisis Management 
Support and has been modified to fit Post needs. 
 
LEVEL ONE SITUATION ) A noticeable change in the country 
situation has been brought to the attention of the EAC. 
Level One changes would be on the order of those described 
below, although not limited to those listed.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C)  Somaliland officials have been practicing an 
unprecedented diplomatic offensive in Djibouti recently with 
both U.S. and Djiboutian representatives.  Somaliland Foreign 
Minister Edna Ismail has met with DAS Yamamoto, AmEmbassy 
Djibouti CDA Timothy Smith, CJTF-HOA Brigadier General 
Robeson, and CJTF-HOA POLAD Ambassador Schermerhorn since 
January 4.  Ismail also held meetings with Djiboutian 
President Ismail Omar Guelleh which were subsequently labeled 
\"a secret mission\" in the internet press.  On January 13 
Guelleh received Somaliland Interior Minister Ismail Aden 
Osman in meetings that were publicly detailed in the local 
press as concerning \"the security domain and the war against 
contraband at the level of frontiers.\"  Ismail may be 
following suggestions from the USG that the Government of 
Djibouti was the only conduit for U.S. Security Assistance to 
Somaliland and it would appear that the GODJ and the 
self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland are taking measures to 
formalize that conduit in advance of any real USG 
preparation.  Post would like to draw attention to this 
development and establish clear, front channel engagement 
protocol for all USG actors in the region. END SUMMARY. 
 
SOMALILAND FOREIGN MINISTER ISMAIL 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (C)  Somaliland Foreign Minister Edna Ismail has taken 
advantage of personal relationships with USG representatives 
in recent months to advance engagement with the USG. 
Ismail, and other Somaliland representatives, have repeated 
the mantra of rightful sovereignty coupled with a call for 
increased U.S. cooperation, particularly regarding security 
concerns and the Global War on Terrorism.  Ismail is clearly 
intrigued by the possibility of limited USG security 
assistance such as training for security forces in 
cooperation with the Djiboutian Government.  Post finds it 
noteworthy that GODJ President Guelleh\'s meetings regarding 
\"security\" and \"frontiers\" with the Interior Minister of 
Somaliland made front page, above the fold coverage in the 
January 14 edition of the state sponsored \"La Nation,\" 
signifying that news event was an important change in policy. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
3. (C)  Djibouti is a major player in the Somalia peace and 
reconciliation process currently taking place in Kenya. 
Somaliland is an integral part of any lasting peace. 
Sunday\'s AFP report of a DOS high level official offering 
significant USG \"financial and diplomatic\" resources were 
being contemplated for the Somalia peace process have piqued 
Djiboutian interest at all levels.  Post feels it is 
important for the USG to advance policy in a concerted manner 
in Somalia and would like an updated engagement protocol for 
the region as local foreign actors begin to manipulate 
isolated messages and outreach to further their own 
interests. END COMMENT.

Classified By: RSO MARC RAMOS FOR REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (SBU) On the morning of January 18, 2004 an explosive 
device detonated aboard a car of the Ethiopian/Djibouti 
Railway.  Current reports reveal that several people 
experienced moderate injuries and one female experienced 
serious injuries that would possibly result in the amputation 
of one of her legs. The severity of her injuries was due to 
proximity to the device.  Djiboutian authorities responded to 
the scene in a timely fashion and immediately began an 
investigation.  Several persons have been detained by the 
Djiboutian authorities for questioning.  At the time of this 
cable, there is insufficient information to comment on the 
details of the incident to include identification of 
suspects, motivation, damage account, evidence, identity of 
the injured or terrorist ties.  There were no Americans or 
expatriates injured as a result of the explosion nor is there 
any impact on American or Western interests within the region. 
 
2. (C) Post comments:  This is one of several incidents that 
have occurred in the past year that have targeted the 
Ethiopian/Djibouti railway.  Although first glimpse would 
indicate that this is a terrorist motivated incident, Post 
believes that the underlying cause for these incidents is 
financially and politically motivated.  Information revealed 
in discussions between key officers at Post and their 
Djiboutian counterparts has indicated that persons who have 
controlling interests in the railway or trucking industry are 
at odds and are taking steps to bolster their financial foot 
hold over their respective businesses.  Post management has 
been asked to provide assistance in renovating and securing 
the railway by members of the Djiboutian government in the 
spirit of fighting the war on terrorism.  Post has informally 
declined such requests and maintains that such efforts to 
prevent or counter terrorism will be done in diplomatic 
coordination with the Host Nation. 
 
3. (C)  Post will continue to work with Host Nation 
counterparts to enhance its counter terrorism capability, but 
does not believe that it is necessary to focus a great amount 
of resources on these incidents other than monitoring and the 
collection of information.  However tragic they may be, Post 
does not believe that these incidents are terrorist in 
nature, but more so criminal acts aimed at eliminating the 
railway.  Furthermore, due to the distance of the railway 
from US facilities, the lack of American or Western interest 
involved and the fact that virtually no Americans or 
Westerners ever board the train, Post believes that these 
incidents only pose a collateral risk to personnel and are of 
no greater threat than being in the wrong place at the wrong 
time. 
 
4. (U) RSO Comments:  It is worth noting that 
counter-terrorism initiatives such as the Diplomatic 
Security\'s Anti Terrorism Assistance Program (DS/ATA) 
continues to benefit the Host Nation as well as the US 
Mission to Djibouti.  In discussions with Host Nation Police, 
the RSO received excellent input from the chief investigator 
on the case, who just happened to be a graduate of the DS/ATA 
Post Blast Investigation course.  The chief investigator 
provided the RSO with detailed accounts of how the 
investigative team utilized the skills and resources provided 
by DS/ATA to conduct an appropriate investigation of the 
crime scene.  The chief investigator expressed sincere 
gratitude for this enhanced capability and  requested that 
DS/ATA training continue as much as possible.  The Djiboutian 
police forces have already incorporated several techniques 
and tactics into their daily operations with positive results 
for Americans and Djiboutians alike.

Classified By: POLITICAL OFFICER C. BEAMER FOR REASONS 1.5 (D) AND (E) 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (U) As outlined in Ref. A on the morning of January 18, 
2004 an explosive device detonated aboard a passenger car of 
the Ethiopian/Djibouti railway.  This explosion follows close 
on the heels of explosions just within the Ethiopian frontier 
of fuel trucks, and is one of several explosions on the 
railway in recent months.  While speculation abounds 
regarding the motives behind the explosion, the Djiboutian 
Government has reacted strongly to the event but appears to 
lack the capacity to coordinate an effective response.  The 
Government has reached out to the international community for 
assistance and taken some measures it hopes will prevent 
future explosions.  A related result of the explosion is the 
pressure applied to Interior Minister Wais to close the 
refugee transit camp of Aour-Aoussa (Ref. C, D, E) which is 
located approximately 15 kilometers from Dassbiyo (site of 
the train explosion) and houses several thousand ethnic Oromo 
Ethiopians. 
 
MOTIVES 
------- 
 
2. (C) Post cannot offer more than speculation as to the 
cause of these recent attacks on commercial lines between 
Djibouti and Ethiopia.  Djiboutian officials and businessmen 
postulate that the strong trucking lobby in Ethiopia tied to 
President Meles is trying to put the kiss of death on the 
commercial railway.  This seems unlikely given the poor state 
of the railway and its relatively minor percentage of 
commercial traffic.  It is significant, however, that two 
commercial fuel trucks were attacked, one in Addis and one 
just inside the Ethiopian frontier near the Djiboutian border 
town of Galafi in recent weeks.  If there is a relation 
between the trucking industry and the train explosions, is it 
a tit for tat exchange?  A more likely theory has scattered 
elements of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) expressing their 
discontent with the Ethiopian establishment and the 
Djiboutian authorities who recently collaborated with them in 
the expulsion of some thousands of Ethiopians living 
illegally in Djibouti (Ref. C, D, E).  But if this were so, 
why does the OLF not take credit?  We do not think so as 
Oromos make up some 40% of the population, have an autonomous 
district which they administer themselves, are represented at 
the National level by an Oromo President, and have a strong 
international lobby including London based human rights 
groups.  These bombings would not seem to benefit OLF 
interests in that light. 
 
GODJ RESPONSE 
------------- 
 
3. (C) President Guelleh has intervened personally and has 
all GODJ pistons firing to address his concerns.  Despite a 
State Department PM funded demining program in the military 
and a DS ATA trained explosive incident countermeasure (EIC) 
squad in the National Police, the capacity of Djiboutian 
security forces to respond to such incidents remains limited. 
 Reports on the very nature of the explosive device have 
ranged from a C-4 charge to an anti-personnel mine.  The 
demining unit of the Djiboutian military has been dispatched 
to border checkpoints with extended mirrors to conduct 
inspections of all transport crossing the frontier.  Six 
people have been arrested and arraigned in conjuction with 
the investigation but Post does not have details of the case. 
 The Djiboutian Minister of International Cooperation Ali 
Youssouf called Ethiopian DCM Yeshi into his office following 
the explosion and told her that the train would be halted 
until the conclusion of the investigation and the Aour-Aoussa 
refugee camp would be closed immediately.  Yeshi told post 
that she feels a third party is behind the explosions, 
unattached to either the Djiboutian or the Ethiopian 
governments.

4. (U) Local UNHCR Representative Collins Asare reported that 
the GODJ has since retreated from its rash decision to 
immediately close the Aour-Aoussa transit center.  The 
Government eligibility commission established for the asylum 
seekers at Aour-Aoussa and currently in place in Ali-Sabieh 
has revamped its efforts to hear the cases before it and has 
announced that all refugees in Aour-Aoussa will have a status 
determination before March 31.  Those who are found to be 
elligible will be incorporated into one of the two existing 
refugee camps in Djibouti and those found inelligible will be 
repatriated to their country of origin.  At that time the 
camp will be closed. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) While the recent explosion should not be seen as an 
immediate threat to U.S. interests in Djibouti, the event 
underlines a continuing need for increased Djiboutian 
capabilities for them to fully participate in the GWOT. 
Djibouti\'s leadership is comitted and will talk its way 
through any legislation or agreement or support to prove that 
is on board for the GWOT, but its capacity to offer real 
assistance on the ground is limited.  Additionally, questions 
that are fundamental to the GWOT such as nationality, 
immigration, and frontiers are still gray in the wild west of 
East Africa.

DEVELOPMENT FACILITY ON THE ENERGY MARKET IN DJIBOUTI. 
 
REF: SECSTATE 347715 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Tim Smith, Charge\' AE Djibouti, Reason 
1.5 (B) 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: The involvement of the African Rift 
Geothermal Development Facility (ARGeo) has the potential 
to bring an end to the stalemate in the negotiations 
between the Government of Djibouti (GODJ) and the private 
American company Geothermal Development Associates (GDA). 
The proposed GDA project at Lake Assal has been in the 
negotiation phase since 1999. 
 
POST\'S RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS IN SECSTATE 347715 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
2. (U) A. International aid for geothermal infrastructure 
development in the region is a priority need.  Geothermal 
development, which is extremely capital intensive, is not 
possible without international aid because the Rift Valley 
countries are among the poorest in the world.  This 
assistance to the region would promote coordination, 
stability and collaboration between the countries in 
the region. 
 
3. (C) B. There are no overt barriers which would affect 
the development of geothermal energy.  Djibouti\'s purported 
advantages for potential investors, including an open trade 
policy, a stable currency, substantial tax breaks, and 
other incentives are less substantial than they may first 
appear.  In practice, the attractiveness of Djibouti for 
foreign investors is greatly marred by the necessity for 
under the table dealings, the fact that virtually all 
economic activity is controlled by government owned 
monopolies, and frequent problems with a corrupt judiciary. 
However, because the high cost of energy exacerbates the 
poverty in Djibouti, there is strong political will to 
develop a cheaper source of energy, including geothermal 
reserves. 
 
4. (U) C. The Ministry of Energy, which has overall 
responsibility for geothermal development projects, has 
repeatedly requested USG technical assistance.  USAID 
technical assistance that clearly identified the potential 
geothermal resources available in Djibouti might assist 
post in supporting its MPP goal of economic development. 
Energy costs are one of the greatest barriers to foreign 
direct investment in Djibouti.  To date, there have been 
only partially funded feasibility studies done by the 
United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). 
U.S. Embassy Djibouti does not have any existing resources 
earmarked for geothermal projects. 
 
GOVERNMENT OF DJIBOUTI PERSPECTIVES 
----------------------------------- 
5. (U) In order to more clearly explain the situation 
surrounding the negotiations on the proposed GDA geothermal 
project, below are summaries of the views expressed in 
recent meetings with key government officials involved in 
the project.  These meetings were an effort to gather 
information and brief the new Political/Economic Officer 
on the history and current position of the geothermal 
project in Djibouti. 
 
6. (SBU) MEETING WITH HOUSSEIN RAYELEH, MINISTRY OF 
ENVIRONMENT: TUESDAY, JANUARY 13, 2004. 
Discussed the local dynamics of the geothermal project with 
GDA and the ARGeo conference.  Rayeleh said that the 
Ministry of Environment was doing the planning for the 
ARGeo meetings at the beginning of March because the 
Ministry of Energy did not have the manpower.  Rayeleh 
mentioned that the sentiment in the government was 
favorable to geothermal possibilities, but that there were 
certain officials (namely the director of Electricite de 
Djibouti-EDD, the government run electricity monopoly) 
who were stalling the project because they want to keep 
control of the power and keep the prices high. 
 
7. (SBU) MEETING WITH SECRETAIRE GENERALE ABDI FARAH CHIDEH 
AT MINISTRY OF ENERGY: WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 14, 2004. 
Discussed the GDA project and why it had stalled.  Chideh\'s 
opinion was that there were several problems with the 
project and that GDA was poorly organized.  First, the 
resources had not been confirmed and there was more research 
needed.  Second, the fact that GDA wanted a signed agreement 
for the exploration and exploitation without proper 
confirmation of the resources was unreasonable.  Third, 
that to request a Purchase Power Agreement (PPA) without 
confirmation of resources, how could GDA know how much it 
would cost for the production per kW.  Fourth, that GDA 
needs to explain more clearly how they will finance the 
project.  Chideh mentioned that GODJ did not have full faith 
that GDA could complete the project because it does not have 
the resources to finance the project itself.  In response to 
the statement, that once the agreements were signed GDA 
would be able to raise the capital necessary, Chideh said 
that all the Ministry asked was that GDA followed the proper 
\"internationally recognized methods\" for conducting a 
project. Chideh did not elaborate what he meant by this. 
 
8. (SBU) MEETING WITH DIRECTOR GENERAL DJAMA ABDI GUELLEH AT 
ELECTRICITE DE DJIBOUTI (EDD): THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 2004. 
Guelleh, an engineer by trade, detailed the technical 
problems that have been found in the exploration process 
and why GODJ wanted to do more research on the resources. 
The majority of the discussion was centered around the price 
that GDA wants in the PPA ($0.12 per kW).  He brought up the 
point that GDA sells electricity to power companies in 
Nevada at five cents and those power companies in turn 
sell it at seven cents per kW.  He said that 12 cents was 
too high.  He pointed out that the diesel fuel purchased 
for EDD\'s electricity production was nine cents per kW. 
He calculated this figure by saying at the commercial price 
of 28 cents per kW, the cost of diesel, including the 33 
percent tax rate on all purchased materials, made up 40 
percent of the total price.  He said that if GDA agreed to 
sell the electricity to EDD at seven cents, he would sign 
tomorrow.  Guelleh seemed to doubt that GDA had completed 
enough research to start production and stated that only 
five million dollars would be needed for the government 
to explore the resources sufficiently.  Guelleh also 
expressed concern over GDA asking the GODJ to sign a 
guarantee for the project and that if GDA failed, Djibouti 
would have to pay.  Econ/Commercial Assistant, Abdi 
Mahamoud Abdi, said that this was apparently an issue 
last year and had been resolved because funding had been 
found from other sources.  To this, Guelleh responded that 
if that was the case and GDA would agree to seven cents, 
the project should go ahead. 
 
9. (SBU) MEETING WITH DIRECTOR GENERAL DR. JALLUDIN MOHAMED 
AT CENTRE D\'ETUDES ET DE RECHERCHES DE DJIBOUTI (CERD): 
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 21, 2004. 
Dr. Mohamed detailed the research and exploration process 
of geothermal energy in Djibouti since before the country\'s 
independence.  Included in his history of the exploration 
were the reasons each project attempt had been abandoned. 
The most common reason given was lack of funding or interest 
from international investors. He said that the deeper 
reserve at Lake Assal, which has the best energy potential, 
was abandoned because the water had such a high salt content 
that scaling and corrosion were an obstacle that could not 
be overcome due to the sheer cost of the potential solution. 
Dr. Mohamed explained that the second reserve at Lake Assal 
has not been tested for how much potential energy it could 
produce, but that the problem of scaling and corrosion 
would not be a factor.  In answer to the question of why 
there were such differing answers as to the reason the 
project had stalled from the other key players in the 
geothermal project, Dr. Mohamed replied that his opinion 
was that it was not a matter of ulterior motives, but more 
a matter of confusion.  Dr. Mohamed explained that Djibouti 
has not had any experience with private investment 
negotiations and that much confusion has been caused by a 
lack of knowledge of the process.  His opinion was that 
the negotiations needed to be brought to the table for a 
fresh start and that with the aid of the ARGeo project 
expertise, the different concerns would be easily 
alleviated. 
COMMENT 
------- 
10. (SBU) Post feels that the information gathered in the 
above meetings does not fully explain the stalemate in the 
geothermal project.  Background information on the 
Secretary General of the Ministry of Energy and the 
 
SIPDIS 
Director of EDD lead post to believe that their intentions 
are not devoid of self-interest and the reasons for the 
delays may go beyond the concerns they expressed.  EDD\'s 
Djama Guelleh received $2 million in emergency Economic 
Support Funds (ESF) to pay back oil fees in April of 2003. 
Guelleh is the cousin of the President of Djibouti, speaks 
impeccable English, and due to his influence is probably 
the center of both the problem and resolution. 
 
11. (SBU) Post lacks the necessary technical expertise to 
evaluate figures given us by the various government 
officials.  Post is also lacking the GDA point of view 
and their expertise in the geothermal field. In order to 
find the truth of the matter, the two halves of the story 
are needed.  The outside influence and expertise provided 
by ARGeo may be the best hope for forward movement on 
this project, as it may clearly delineate the obstacles 
in place.  END COMMENT.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (S/NF)  Amidst growing Djiboutian Government stir related 
to recent explosions (Ref. A) and claims by Puntland 
strongman Abdullahi Yusuf of Djibouti arming Somaliland 
against him in the Sool region, Post SAO Major Patrick 
Anderson received a browbeating on January 27 from 
Abdourahman Boreh, perhaps the individual closest to 
Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh.  Boreh expressed a 
growing frustration from the Djiboutian side.  Boreh believes 
that despite their continued and ongoing support of the U.S. 
on several counter terrorism fronts Djibouti has not gained 
the concrete means to properly protect its own interests.  He 
made specific mention of the 25 million dollars in FMF 
security assistance that Djibouti has yet to see complaining 
that in the meantime, \"If we take one hit at the Port we are 
finished.\"  Boreh was accompanied by Colonel Abdou, head of 
the President\'s Republican Guard, and Mohamed Ali Hassan, 
designated American military handler at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  The meeting reinforces Post\'s perception 
that the Djiboutians feel recent events have elevated their 
profile vis a vis transnational terrorism to unprecedented 
levels, while making evident their inability to react 
effectively. 
 
THE MESSAGE 
----------- 
 
2. (S/NF)  The fundamental complaint is not a new one for 
those familiar with the recent history of an increased U.S. 
footprint in Djibouti.  High expectations have been created 
by the increased DOD and other U.S. Agency presence here and 
Djibouti\'s business elite want to see the goods delivered. 
They are particularly anxious about the security of their 
port and airport, the pillars upon which the service economy 
is built.  Team after team of evaluators from numerous U.S. 
agencies have passed through both facilities and still the 
Djiboutians do not have the naval capacity to protect their 
current port let alone provide the investor assuaging 
coverage of their oil terminal project in Dorale that they 
desperately want.  Boreh cited the recent attack on the train 
(see reftel) and increased terrorist actions in Somaliland as 
evidence that the terrorist threat in Djibouti has risen 
significantly in recent weeks.  Boreh said \"We (US and DJI) 
have those things going on in Somaliland...there are people 
there who could do bad things to Djibouti...we (DJI) know the 
Ethiopians are doing something with the train...we (DJI) are 
going to do some raids and kick the shit out of some people 
to send a message...we (DJI) know that Djibouti is the port 
and airport and if anything happens to them we are 
finished...we (DJI) need the security now, especially with 
the new project in Dorale to make sure that the Americans are 
safe.\"  He went on to state that the USG must produce some 
tangible assistance in order to reassure the military 
leadership that they (the USG) are serious about improving 
Djibouti\'s security.  The Djiboutians fear that a terrorist 
attack at this critical juncture in both their economic 
development and the development of what they hope will be a 
long term U.S. presence would be the end of their grand 
strategy.  Major Anderson reminded those present that 
Djibouti is not alone in their frustration and that the US 
remains committed to helping Djibouti with their security 
needs.  He noted that the same system used to assist Djibouti 
is assisting Afghanistan and Iraq but that it takes time. 
 
THE MESSENGER 
------------- 
 
3. (S/NF) Abdourahman Boreh is the financial face of Ismail 
Omar Guelleh.  He was a relatively minor player in local 
Djiboutian commerce until he rode Guelleh\'s coattails up the 
power ladder to his current seat as his richest and most 
influential economic advisor.  There are three villas 
constructed on Djibouti\'s exclusive Haramous peninsula, the 
first belongs to President Guelleh, the second to Boreh, and 
the third to ex-President Gouled.  Boreh orchestrated the 
2001 Arta conference which gave birth to the Transitional 
National Government in Mogadishu.  Boreh\'s economic base 
starts as the local representative of British-American 
Tobacco.  When shipments of his cigarettes were seized on the 
Somaliland frontier in 2000 it was enough to have the 
frontier closed and chill Djiboutian- 
Somaliland relations until reparations were paid almost two 
years later.  Boreh had a category 1 visa hit (later overcome 
by Security Advisory Opinion) which Post believes stems from 
an Interpol investigation into the illegal exportation of 
Ethiopian coffee.  He is not widely popular and an opposition 
contact said \"Boreh would sell you his mother if it meant he 
could make a dime.\"  He has close ties to Dubai and the UAE, 
including Dubai Ports International.  He owns the largest 
construction company in Djibouti, Supreme, and has profited 
handsomely from construction contracts at Camp Lemonier, home 
to U.S. forces in Djibouti. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4. (S/NF)  Boreh and Guelleh have big plans for the oil port 
terminal in Dorale.  These plans hinge upon a U.S. Naval 
contract with Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC) and a 
continued good reputation for security and stability at their 
current port.  Increased collaboration with the U.S. on many 
fronts has elevated their threat profile and in light of 
recent explosions on the train and activities in Somaliland, 
they are getting nervous.  Boreh wants to see the 
oft-promised security assistance and he wants to see it 
yesterday.  Djibouti is less a country than a commercial city 
state controlled by one man, Ismail Omar Guelleh.  He sent 
his money man, who usually does not attend these meetings, to 
deliver a message. The Djiboutian Government believes (or 
wants us to believe) they are at greater risk to terrorist 
attack than ever before.  They hope this message will 
expedite delivery. 
 
5. (S/NF) Post would like to expedite security assistance as 
well and has spoken about this with CJTF-HOA and will raise 
the issue with DSCA\'s Europe, Russia, Americas, and 
Sub-Saharan Africa Director, Ms. Jeanne Farmer, later this 
week.  However, we still believe the train incidents do not 
impact the U.S. interest in the Horn and best guesses are 
they relate to larger Djiboutian-Ethiopian frictions. End 
comment.

Classified By: RSO MARC RAMOS FOR REASON 1.5 (C) AND (D) 
 
1. (SBU) On Thursday January 29, 2004, Post received an 
Unclassified E-MAIL from the Foreign Minister of the self 
 
SIPDIS 
proclaimed State of Somaliland, Edna Adan Ismail claiming an 
unconfirmed threat to the sea ports of Djibouti and Berbera. 
Ismail sent this report to Post\'s Executive OMS using her 
internet Yahoo.com account.  Ismail states the following in 
her E-MAIL: 
 
BEGIN QUOTE - There are some unconfirmed reports that there 
is a plot to attack the ports of Djibouti and Berbera.  The 
attack is threatened from the North east Coast of Somalia. 
We are keeping our eyes open and would advise that just an 
extra vigilance be exercised at your end.  Although we hope 
that this turns out to be a false alarm.  It does not do any 
harm to be alert and trust that you will take the necessary 
measures.  With best regards, Edna Adan Ismail.  END QUOTE. 
 
2. (S/NF) RSO, CDA and COS discussed the content of the 
E-MAIL and felt it prudent to share the information with Host 
Nation sources to determine the validity of the threat. 
Taking into consideration the information from Ismail, the 
Host Nation immediately discounted the information sighting 
several political reasons why the threat is unlikely.  RSO 
and COS concur with the Host Nation and believe that this is 
not a viable threat nor does it pose any risk to Americans, 
coalition partners or Western interests.  That being said, 
the Host Nation advised that it would take the necessary 
precautions and closely monitor activity at the port. 
 
3. (S/NF) It must be noted that there has been a rivalry 
brewing between Puntland and Somaliland.  Somaliland has had 
increasingly good relations with the Government of Djibouti 
(GODJ) while Puntland continues to criticize the GODJ for 
providing arms support to Somaliland.  The GODJ has strongly 
denied such support.  This reporting from Ismail could be 
evidence that Somaliland continues to nurture hope for closer 
Djibouti-US-Somaliland security cooperation. 
 
The self proclaimed government of Somaliland has stated on 
several occasions that it wishes to gain favor and support 
from the USG as an active partner in the Global War on 
Terrorism.  Although Post believes that this sort of 
reporting from Mrs. Ismail could be a sign of button pushing 
it could also be a sign of a closer dialogue evolving between 
the USG and Somaliland.  Key Embassy and Military officers 
have met with Mrs. Ismail on several occasions and she is 
completely aware that the USG has a keen interest in the 
region.  Post expects to receive more communications from 
Ismail in the future.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (S/NF)  Djiboutian Ambassador to the United States Roble 
Olhaye met at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti on February 25 with 
Brigadier General Mastin Robeson.  Ambassador Olhaye is 
nearing the end of a two week stay in Djibouti and was 
present for Ambassador Ragsdale\'s credentialing ceremony on 
the 23rd.  General Robeson and Olhaye focused on the way 
forward for a long term lease relationship between the 
Department of Defense and the Government of Djibouti.  End 
Summary. 
 
OLHAYE/ROBESON 
-------------- 
 
2. (S/NF) Olhaye congratulated General Robeson for having 
achieved a lot in a short period, making a number of camp 
improvements, and making his presence felt over the Red Sea 
and in neighboring countries.  General Robeson thanked Olhaye 
and asked if he had suggestions for how his organization\'s 
effectiveness could be improved.  Olhaye responded that he 
thought the task force was doing the right thing, 
coordinating with militaries in the region and making people 
feel accepted.  He said that President was positive about 
their actions and that their civil affairs efforts in 
particular had been very well received in Djibouti. 
 
3. (S/NF)  General Robeson then raised the base\'s long term 
lease relationship and how to make it amenable to both sides. 
 Olhaye responded that he had discussed the issue with DOD 
for the Government of Djibouti.  Djibouti welcomed the U.S. 
presence and would continue to do all it could to provide 
facilities but it desired a long term commitment.  He said 
Djibouti was not in a position to put any timelines or 
constraints on the USG, that the U.S. was \"welcome to stay 
permanently if it wished and to expand, to be more 
comfortable.\"  Olhaye added that Djibouti will try its best 
to provide what the military needs and to be welcoming. 
General Robeson asked Olhaye if he would be involved in lease 
negotiations and the Olhaye responded positively that he 
would be representing the Djiboutian Government in 
Washington.  He went on to say that the lease was not really 
a question of signatures or price noting that his initial 
proposal to the USG was for 150 million dollars.  \"The 15 
million we\'re actually getting is only important to us as a 
symbol of partnership, what comes from the U.S. presence here 
is what is important.\" 
 
4. (S/NF) General Robeson responded that eventually the U.S. 
would not have a permanent presence in Djibouti but that we 
wanted to leave a stronger, more capable Djiboutian military 
behind that was doing things right.  He stressed that with 
efforts in border security, coastal security, and 
anti-terrorism he wanted to help the Djiboutian Military 
understand the impact it can have nationally by partnering 
with outlying regions and acting as an engine of national 
development. 
 
5. (S/NF) Olhaye stated that he thought the specifics of 
military to military discussions should be resolved by 
General Robeson\'s leadership.  Olhaye saw no reason for 
stalemate on such issues but said they should be handled fast 
and in an acceptable manner here on the ground.  He asked 
General Robeson to \"use your wisdom, see their point of view, 
come to consensus and resolve the matter.\"  General Robeson 
responded that he was looking for a positive way to move 
forward so that the military to military relationship was a 
happy one. 
 
6. (S/NF)  In this regard, General Robeson said, he had two 
options for resolving current tensions that revolved around 
the Djiboutian airbase/Presidential hangar that was ceded to 
the USG under the current lease.  The first was to move the 
airbase to an area near the civilian hangers.  Olhaye stated 
that that was not possible.  General Robeson went on to note 
that the Djiboutians could stay in that space but that the 
security measures he would take would hem them in and they 
would be unable to grow.  The General emphasized that either 
the Djiboutian military needed to content itself with the 
current space limitations or move further east of Camp 
Lemonier near the water.  Olhaye said either option was 
possible, there would be no noise on the issue, but that if 
the Djiboutian Military moved CJTF-HOA would have to \"help 
them move.\"  Olhaye went on to say that if freedom of access 
could be provided to the Djiboutian military, everything 
could be sorted out.  He said his government was not happy 
with him when he signed and that \"we are beyond the original 
map.\" 
 
7. (S/NF)  Olhaye stressed that frictions should be kept here 
at the local level and that there were problems with giving 
the General more ramp space at the Eastern edge of Camp 
Lemonier.  The General responded that a written proposal was 
being drafted in Washington for additional acreage and the 
issue would have to be resolved at another level.  Olhaye 
said he felt the French might have designs on that land as 
they were expanding with another 1,400 troops on the ground 
in Djibouti.  When queried on the possibility of a new 
civilian airport on the other side of the bay from Camp 
Lemonier, Olhaye responded that \"nothing was imminent.\" 
 
8. (S/NF)  In closing General Robeson stated that he hoped 
the proposal turned out to be amenable and acceptable to 
Djibouti.  Olhaye responded that from his point of view 
everything should be done together rather than in piece meal 
fashion.  The General concurred that a holistic approach 
would be best and he hoped we could move quickly on 
implementing a long term solution which does not hinder our 
warm relations.  He said the easiest solution was to 
acknowledge that the airbase you want is yours and if 
additional space is needed eastward expansion is possible. 
General Robeson stressed that this issue should not affect 
the relationship at all and that he knew Generals Fahti and 
Zakaria had worked hard to maintain close relations with us. 
He said he had given his word that he would not go home until 
this issue had been resolved and that he was scheduled to 
depart in May.

2. (U) The IMF approved a three-year US$26.5 million loan 
for the GODJ under the ESAF programin October 1999 to 
assist GODJ\'s three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Facility (PRGF) program.  The ESAF was scheduled to end 
October 2002, but, by request of the GODJ was extended 
until January 2003.  Despite this extension, GODJ did 
not complete all the reforms required by the IMF.  The 
IMF has now returned to begin a new partnership, called 
a Staff Monitored Program.  The SMP, which does not 
involve any financing, is an informal agreement between 
GODJ and the IMF staff to monitor the implementation of 
the GODJ\'s economic program.  The secondary purpose of 
the IMF visit was to finalize GODJ\'s Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Paper. 
 
SUMMARY OF DONOR\'S MEETING: 29 FEBRUARY 2004 
------------------------------------------- 
3. (U) As a conclusion to the IMF team\'s visit, the 
donors from the international community present in Djibouti 
met to hear the findings of the recent evaluation.  The 
participants included two visiting IMF representatives, 
the resident IMF representative and representatives from 
the French Cooperation, Russian Embassy, the European Union, 
Saudi Arabia, the World Bank, Japan, UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF, 
WFP and the U.S. Embassy. 
 
4. (U) According to the IMF, the SMP will last one year 
(2004) and will mainly monitor the completion of the 
reforms required by the IMF in the first ESAF. There will 
also be some additional measures, such as the Code of 
Commerce and the publication of the \"Chambre des Comptes\" 
2002 report.  The SMP will start after the signing of the 
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), 
which reportedly should be done in the coming days. 
The MEFP contains a detailed list of reforms to be 
completed and requires regular progress reporting on a 
quarterly or bi-yearly basis.  The SMP is expected to 
restore GODJ\'s credibility with the donors. 
 
5. (U) The IMF delegation is also assisting GODJ in the 
final review of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
draft in the area of micro-economic framework.  The IMF 
delegation indicated that the PRSP is in good shape with 
more realistic figures.  It will be officially discussed 
for approval in the regular IMF Council meeting April 
2004.  GODJ would like to present the approved document 
to a round table donors\' meeting in Djibouti this summer. 
The funding for the first three years of the PRSP is 
estimated at US$ 261 million. 
 
6. (U) The IMF also touched on the Program of Public 
Investment (PIP), which concerns all the major public 
projects; infrastructure, education, health, etc.  The 
IMF indicated that 80 percent of the fund should come 
from the international community.  The PIP will not be 
feasible without the assistance of the donors. 
 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
7. (U) The IMF staff indicated that GODJ has shown a 
change in attitude and is now more receptive to their 
recommendations.  The IMF delegation added that GODJ is 
realizing that they have to show transparency in order 
to gain the international community\'s confidence.  The 
representatives from the French Cooperation and the 
European Union did not seem convinced of GODJ\'s new 
behavior.  If the SMP is successfully completed, the 
IMF and GODJ will negotiate the terms of a new ESAF.

SUBJECT: 2ND REQUEST FOR REACTIVATION OF A MARINE SECURITY 
GUARD DETACHMENT IN DJIBOUTI 
 
REF: 03 DJIBOUTI 988 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA RAGSDALE FOR REASON 1.5 
(C)AND (G) 
 
1. (U) Ambassador Ragsdale supports REFTEL request that a 
Marine Security Guard Detachment (MSG DET) be re-activated at 
American Embassy Djibouti.  Embassy Djibouti submitted REFTEL 
in May of 2003 and, to date, has not received an official 
reply.  The following justification for an MSG DET is 
resubmitted. 
 
2. (S/NF) The establishment of the only U.S. Military base in 
Sub-Saharan Africa has placed numerous demands for resources 
and information on the Embassy that has resulted in an 
increase in the processing, storage and dissemination of 
classified material at the highest levels.  ORCA has 
established a permanent Station at the Embassy and with it 
the ability to receive and disseminate information at a 
TS/SCI level. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
3. (S/NF) The security of the Station and its classified 
material is of great concern to Post management as well as to 
the RSO and COS.  Recent activity, outlined in intelligence 
reporting, clearly indicates that the capability of foreign 
intelligence services to mount a technical intelligence 
attack exists within Djibouti.  RSO, ORCA and U.S. MIL/INTEL 
all agree that it is a matter of time before a HUMINT/TECHINT 
attack is carried out by several intelligence sources in 
country.  The presence of the Chinese, Libyan, Russian, 
French and other nations, with a long history of hostile 
intelligence operations, is a clear indicator that the 
probability for such an attack to be carried out is greater 
now than ever before.  The existing threat, coupled with a 
lock and leave facility plagued with constant technical 
difficulties, is a simple formula for the compromise of 
national security information. 
 
4. (S/NF) Due to the sensitivity of intelligence operations 
at Post, COS supports the reactivation of an MSG DET and has 
indicated this through separate channels.  The COS\'s report 
underscores Post\'s deep concerns and the critical need for an 
MSG DET.  In addition, Djibouti\'s status as a front-line 
country in the Global War On Terrorism (GWOT) makes it 
extremely difficult for Post to have an effective walk-in 
program absent the presence of an MSG DET. 
 
5. (SBU) Post is cognizant of the large cost that goes 
hand-in-hand with establishing an MSG DET.  Post points out 
however, that the former MSG DET in Djibouti was deactivated 
in 1997 and that much of the physical infrastructure required 
to begin operations currently exists.  Post One is complete 
and fully operational with upgraded equipment.  Although the 
former Marine house has been converted into office space, 
adequate housing exists in the City of Djibouti that can 
easily accommodate 5 watch standers and still meet the 
security and social needs of the Detachment.  In addition, 
the Ambassador has indicated her willingness to release the 
current CMR, located on the compound, for use of the MSG 
Detachment, should OBO and DS concur on an off compound CMR. 
The current CMR can be easily renovated to meet the standards 
of an MSGR.  Office space for a Detachment Commander and a 
react room for the Marines can be converted from existing 
space. 
 
6. (S) Ambassador Ragsdale request the Department give strong 
consideration to raising Djibouti\'s priority level for 
receiving an MSG DET.  The Ambassador feels that the security 
situation in Djibouti will continue to be highly fluid and 
without an MSG DET to help protect our National Security 
Information, Embassy Djibouti will be vulnerable to an attack 
on several levels.  Should the Embassy suffer a catastrophic 
event Post will be unable to provide adequately the proper 
amount of resources needed to secure the facility while 
dealing with numerous problems an emergency action will 
generate.

SUBJECT: MINISTER OF PRESIDENTIAL AFFAIRS AND DJIBOUTI\'S 
AGENDA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Marguerita D. Ragsdale. 
 Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The close relationship of Minister of 
Presidential Affairs, Osman Ahmed Moussa, with President 
Ismail Omar Guelleh afforded Ambassador the opportunity to 
reaffirm her mandate in Djibouti as U.S. Ambassador and to 
solicit the Minister\'s views on ways to enhance the U.S.- 
Djibouti partnership. During a two-hour meeting which began 
as a courtesy call associated with the Ambassador\'s 
credentialling, the Minister raised attentiveness of donors, 
new partnerships in the  Gulf, diversity of aid, overcoming 
trade problems and infrastructure weaknesses, humanitarian 
and health challenges, human rights and the military 
relationship as Djibouti\'s premier concerns. End summary. 
 
2. (C)  Minister of Presidential Affairs, Osman Ahmed 
Moussa-- who is close to Djibouti\'s President Ismail Omar 
Guelleh-- told Ambassador February 29 during a two-hour 
meeting at the Presidential Office, that Djibouti should not 
be seen merely as a conflict resolution partner for the U.S. 
in the Horn of Africa region but as a partner in economic 
development as well.  The presence of USAID at the U.S. 
Mission, he said, is an encouraging sign. 
 
------------------------- 
Need for Aid Coordination 
------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Moussa said donors needed to be more attentive to the 
needs of Djibouti and to diversify assistance areas. Some 
sectors receive an abundance of aid while others lack 
resources totally, he lamented, and options for development 
are not being fully explored.  For example, date palms could 
provide food and jobs in rural areas.  Their growth would 
combine agriculture and pastoralism and would work well in 
the South which has the necessary ground water.  Also, water 
resources in an area are closely linked to good health, but 
the development of water resources lacks funding.  Moussa 
asked that the U.S. take the first steps in exploring these 
areas and in raising awareness of other donors.  Donors 
should also look closely at aid delivery, noting, for 
example, that Djibouti bought mobile clinics to serve in its 
districts but poor roads made them ineffective. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador responded that she was already exploring 
the concept of establishing an informal working group in 
Djibouti of donors, NGOs, UN organizations, and USAID which 
would meet regularly --perhaps monthly-- to review and 
coordinate development programs in-country.  This might 
diminish duplication of development efforts and identify 
other areas where development aid might best benefit 
Djibouti.  She said she had not yet broached the idea with 
donors and donor entities here but would do so soon. 
 
5. (C) Moussa said he believed this a good idea.  He noted 
that 22,000 Somali refugees at Ali-Adde were using a large 
portion of the resources of UN agencies.  Djibouti\'s program 
of repatriation of refugees to Somaliland is aimed at freeing 
up these resources for Djibouti\'s use. He said the fact, 
though, that U.N. representatives are African makes easier 
their understanding of the challenges facing the Government 
of Djibouti despite the internal constraints and restrictions 
that prevent those agencies from fully supporting Djibouti. 
 
----------------------- 
Hope in a Free Zone 
----------------------- 
 
6. (C) Moussa suggested that development of a Free Zone in 
Djibouti would reduce the serious problem of unemployment. 
While investors have shown interest, there is little activity 
to date.  Moussa expressed uncertainty as to why investment 
is not happening but suggested the problem might lie in 
Djibouti\'s failure to communicate adequately with investors. 
He asked for U.S. assistance and advice, which Ambassador 
pledged to provide. 
 
---------------------- 
Looking Gulfward 
---------------------- 
 
7. (C) Ambassador asked if Djibouti saw opportunities for 
development avenues in its relationships with the Gulf states 
and Yemen.  Moussa cited Yemen and said Djibouti would like 
to partner with Yemen in the tourist trade, perhaps 
attracting a share of the more than one million tourists 
annually that Yemen receives.  Djibouti could be an 
additional destination because of its close proximity. Good 
tourist sites exist in the Gulf of Tadjoura but measures 
would need to be taken, he cautioned, to ensure the 
environmental integrity of Djibouti\'s coral reefs.  In 
addition, Moussa said, Djibouti is discussing with Yemen 
prospects for Djibouti\'s port becoming a regional 
distribution point for Yemeni oil. 
 
8. (C) Ambassador asked about a present or potential role for 
Yemeni businessmen generally in the development of Djibouti\'s 
economy.  Moussa opined that Yemeni businessmen, while active 
in Djibouti, do not participate in the local economy, 
preferring to remain simple retailers who take their money 
out.  In the past, he said, Yemenis were some of the most 
important importers in Djibouti.  (Note: Ambassador wants to 
explore this issue further with her interlocutors in 
Djibouti. End note.) 
 
9. (C) Moussa said trade with the Gulf countries, and 
specifically the UAE (Dubai), is increasing since the medium 
of exchange between the two is the dollar. He remarked that 
Dubai is crowded as buyers come from all over Africa and the 
Middle East.  Djibouti is hopeful, he indicated, that there 
will be businesses in Dubai wishing to re-locate to 
Djibouti\'s free zone in order to serve African customers and 
gain market proximity.  (Comment: The Dubai Port Authority 
manages Djibouti\'s port and airport. End comment.) 
 
--------------------------- 
Whither the French 
--------------------------- 
 
10.  On relations with France today, Moussa described them as 
affected by a French \"attitude of neglect.\" \"The fact that 
whole Mirage engines have been stolen from French bases shows 
the extent of neglect,\" he said.  French cooperation at the 
Presidency level, Moussa continued, does not exist because 
the Government of Djibouti does not want the French involved 
at centers of decisionmaking.  However, the French are 
present as technical advisers in various ministries. 
France\'s relationship with the Government of Djibouti has 
continually diminished to the point, he stated, \"that they 
feel completely isolated and lost.\"   Moussa said he believes 
France never had a vision of Djibouti as a commercial 
platform by which it could penetrate the African market. With 
France now, he said, trade is becoming more difficult because 
of the high value of the Euro. 
 
---------------------------- 
U.S. Military and Assistance 
---------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Moussa noted in passing that the U.S. military has 
assisted Djibouti in commercial ways.  He said its provision 
of night vision capability had been especially useful in his 
country\'s efforts to stop the entry of contraband -- human or 
material -- across Djibouti\'s borders. 
 
--------------------------- 
The Sticky Problem of Human Rights 
---------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) Moussa commented that the only problem Djibouti 
appeared to have with the U.S. is the negative yearly Human 
Rights report, which he said \"does not reflect reality.\" 
Ambassador responded that Djibouti does have a poor record in 
this area and that there is room for improvement. 
 
13. (C) Moussa counseled that the USG should be cautious and 
should watch out for \"manipulation\" and \"misinformation\" in 
the human rights field that could come from both the 
Government of Djibouti\'s staff and from the opposition.  The 
U.S. should be especially vigilant, he said, as allegations 
fly in the period leading up to (presidential) elections. 
 
----------- 
Comment 
----------- 
 
14. (C)  The precedent for this conversation was set during 
the Ambassador\'s presentation of credentials to President 
Guelleh. She will follow through on plans to establish a 
working group of donors and others to look at economic 
assistance here.  She also has informally canvassed her 
Ambassadorial colleagues --on whom she has called-- about 
their countries\' aid programs/plans for Djibouti. Egypt\'s 
ambassador had earlier raised the possibility of date 
farming, including Egypt\'s potential to contribute, among 
other issues.  A coordination on aid would prove useful on 
several fronts, including as we begin to focus on other 
issues, such as corruption. Of course, individual constraints 
on donors and aid agencies will remain an important factor. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: DISCONTENT IN THE DJIBOUTIAN MILITARY 
 
 
Classified By: POLOFF CHASE BEAMER FOR REASONS 1.5 B 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C) USLO Chief has learned that on Saturday, February 28 
large groups of soldiers in the interior districts of Dikhil, 
Tadjoura, and Obock refused to accept their monthly salaries. 
 Four high ranking Djiboutian military officers have since 
been dispatched to the districts to engage the disgruntled 
troops and address their complaints.  Hypotheses are 
circulating as to the origins of the problem but each is in 
some way tied to the military pay scale.  Senior officials in 
Djibouti city downplay the significance of the action 
claiming that all differences will be resolved shortly. 
 
HYPOTHESES 
---------- 
 
2. (C)  There are effectively two types of soldiers in the 
Djiboutian Military:  those enlisted through standard 
procedure and those mobilized specifically for the civil war 
in the early 1990\'s.  Troops mobilized for the civil war have 
remained on military payrolls at a reduced pay rate since the 
end of the country\'s civil war.  In addition, in 2002 
President Guelleh created a \"Republican Guard\" force in 
reaction to a failed \"coup d\'etat\" led by former Police Chief 
and Guelleh insider Yacin Yalah Galab.  Guelleh was less than 
thrilled by the military\'s response in defense of the 
Presidency during the hours long insurgency.  He established 
a 300 member elite protection force composed in overwhelming 
part of members of his sub-clan, the Issa Mammasan, and under 
the direction (in practice if not in theory) of his National 
Security Advisor Hassan Said Khaireh.  The Republican Guard 
is the best equipped and trained force in the country.  It is 
the only portion of the military to receive supplemental 
\"danger pay\" and monthly food rations.  The Republican Guards 
were recently enlarged to 500 members following a much 
publicized reduction of the Police Force to meet European 
Union demobilization mandates.  In January, the Republican 
Guard celebrated its second anniversary on national 
television with much fanfare and numerous promotions.  Some 
feel that the privilege of the Republican Guard has stirred 
resentment among the rest of the Djiboutian military and 
brought them to act.  Sources say that Djiboutian Military 
Chief of Staff General Fahti cut an approximately U.S. $30 a 
month food stipend from the standing military\'s monthly 
paycheck and that this, on top of the standing food ration 
the Republican Guard receives, was too much for soldiers to 
bear. 
 
3. (C)  A second and perhaps related but unconfirmed rumor in 
Djibouti City portrays a small clique of four or five young 
military officers as piqued at the slow rates of promotion in 
recent years.  This clique has organized troops in the 
interior on this issue.  Reportedly, the officers have widely 
circulated a petition at the lower levels of the military 
recruiting other officers for their protest.  The widespread 
and unified actions of soldiers in three different districts 
would suggest some level of organization and coordination 
beyond the capacity of junior non-commissioned officers and 
soldiers. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4. (C)  While the details of this incident are still gray one 
can ascertain from the absences of General Zakaria, Colonel 
Bouh, LtColonel Abdoulrahman, and Commandant Osman from the 
capital simultaneously that the Djiboutian leadership is 
treating the matter seriously.  Djibouti is under pressure 
from International donors to demobilize the mission-less 
military (Djibouti\'s territorial defense is guaranteed by 
French forces) and trim bureaucratic fat.  At the same time 
Djibouti\'s economy remains weak and unemployment is chronic. 
Add to these factors simmering resentment towards President 
Guelleh\'s private tribal army and you likely are not far from 
the root of these events.  End comment.

SUBJECT: DESALINIZATION FEASIBILITY STUDY RECEIVES USTDA 
GRANT 
 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Ambassador Marguerita D. Ragsdale 
represented the U.S. in signing a grant agreement 
3 March 2004 between the U.S. Trade and Development 
Agency and the Office National des Eaux de Djibouti 
(ONED) to fund a feasibility study for a Desalinization 
Plant for Djibouti City. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) In a ceremony in the Ambassador\'s office March 3, 
Ambassador and Mr. Abdulkader Kamil, Director General, 
signed a grant agreement between the U.S. Trade Development 
Agency and the Office National des Eaux de Djibouti 
(Djibouti National Office of Water) or ONED.  The 
agreement funds a $276,000 feasibility study for a 
Desalinization plant for Djibouti City. 
 
3. (U) The Government of Djibouti strongly believes 
that desalinization is the most viable alternative for 
Djibouti.  In recent years, the quality of water has 
deteriorated due mainly to overexploitation and non- 
renewal of the water reserve, due to lack of rainfall. 
The Japanese have assisted ONED in drilling new wells 
and rehabilitating the existing wells, but this does 
not seem to fully solve the problem.  Currently, the 
water supply cannot meet the increasing demand and the 
situation may become even more dire in the coming years. 
ONED has come to its last two options; a desalinization 
plant within the city or development of wells in the 
Hanle region, some 200 kilometers from the city.  The 
cost of an extensive network of piping needed to 
transport the water from the Hanle wells is a crucial 
factor in the decision. A desalinization plant also 
has possible benefits for the Livestock Holding Facility 
project currently being researched by USAID.  In addition 
to U.S. involvement in water studies, the President\'s 
Advisor on Investment, Fahmi Ahmed Al-Hag, said that 
the Saudis are conducting a cost comparison study of 
the two options. 
 
4. (U) ONED falls under the auspices of the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Livestock and Sea.  It is the Djiboutian 
government entity in charge of water supply and 
Hydraulic Resources in all five districts in Djibouti. 
Djibouti City and other towns in the district are 
supplied by deep wells drilled by ONED services, while 
smaller villages in the country use underground cisterns 
and shallow wells.  Djibouti City has some 30 wells 
within its boundaries to serve its roughly 200,000 person 
population.

REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) In a February 29 call on Minister of Presidential 
Affairs, Osman Ahmed Moussa (reported septel), Ambassador 
raised the CJTF-HOA presence in Djibouti, its role and that 
of the U.S. Mission in support of the global war on 
terrorism.  She noted that the Camp Lemonier lease agreement 
was up for renewal and asked who would lead negotiations on 
behalf of the Government of Djibouti.  She also noted that 
Ambassador Roble Olhaye had been in touch with General 
Robeson on some aspects of the lease agreement. 
 
2. (C)  Moussa responded that \"in the past, there was no 
coordination on the lease among various government offices in 
Djibouti.  Today, the Ministry of Presidential Affairs is the 
official coordinator on military matters.\"  Moussa did not 
confirm that Olhaye would be point person nor did he deny it. 
 
3. (C) In what could easily have been interpreted as a joke, 
based on manner of delivery of his remarks, Moussa quickly 
added that \"France is currently paying 30 million Euros to 
the Government of Djibouti annually for base leasing rights 
in Djibouti\" (an amount subsequently confirmed to Ambassador 
by France\'s Brigadier General Gerard Pons, Commander of 
French Forces stationed in Djibouti).  \"It will help the 
economy of Djibouti,\" Moussa said, \"if the U.S. increased its 
payment from USD 15 million to USD 30 million.\" (Note: 
General Pons told Ambassador and USLO chief during a meeting 
at the U.S. Embassy March 3, that his military also procures 
its durable supplies on the local Djibouti market and that 
members of the French military based here pay income taxes to 
the Government of Djibouti. End Note). 
 
4. (C) Comment:  We cannot determine at this time if the USD 
30 million figure mentioned by Moussa will be a starting 
point for Djibouti\'s negotiations with the Department of 
Defense on a continuing lease agreement for Camp Lemonier.

1.5 b and d 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: After a long hiatus, voluntary 
repatriations from Djibouti\'s Ali-Adde and Hol-Hol 
refugee camps have begun to leave in reportedly 
steady numbers.  However, food resources remain tight 
and over-evualtion of the population has gone 
unresolved. 
 
REFUGEE REPATRIATION RESUMES 
---------------------------- 
2. (U) UNHCR, in coordination with Djiboutian and 
Somaliland authorities, once again began the repatriation 
of Somaliland refugees.  UNHCR reported that on February 
11th, during the first round of repatriations in over 
six months, 214 refugees turned in their ration cards 
in order to receive their 9-month repatriation food 
package.  The refugees also received forty dollars U.S. 
as an adjustment allowance.  However, sources at UNHCR 
say that only 71 people were physically transported 
from the camps.  This discrepancy alludes to the 
over-estimation of the real refugee population.  There 
are currently over 22,000 registered refugees on the 
rolls in Ali-Adde and Hol-Hol refugee camps.  Even if 
UNHCR succeeded in repatriating \"214\" refugees per week, 
as is their hope, the repatriation would take over two 
years.  World Food Program (WFP) reported that the 
second round of repatriations, which took place on 
February 27th, included 596 persons.  This number has 
not been confirmed, but sources intimate that again, the 
number reflects the number of ration cards turned in and 
food packages doled out, not the number of refugees that 
were relocated to Somaliland. 
 
WFP\'S TIGHT FOOD RESOURCES MAY BE HELPED BY REPATRIATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
3. (U) According to WFP Director Fatma Samoura, unused 
resources that were allocated to 2003 calendar-year 
repatriations were being used to make up food packages 
given to the returning refugees.  Calendar-year 2003 
repatriations totaled 241 persons, whereas resources were 
scheduled for 5,000 to repatriate.  Presently, these 
remaining resources can provide food packages for another 
4,500 repatriations.  Samoura did not indicate whether 
this met the needs for the number of repatriations 
scheduled for calendar-year 2004. 
 
4. (U) Samoura also said that current resources for feeding 
the regular population of the two refugee camps has been 
stretched thin due to the need from the Aour Aoussa Transit 
camp.  The two camps have been on half-ration 
for the past six months in order to prevent a possible 
humanitarian crisis, such as the one that took place in 
September 2003 and to feed the 8,000 plus asylum seekers 
at Aour Aoussa transit camp (RefTel).  Samoura commented 
that the currentresources should last until June, but 
rations may need to be reduced further at that time, 
depending on the success of the repatriations. 
 
EXACT NUMBER OF REFUGEES STILL NOT CERTAIN 
------------------------------------------ 
5. (C) UNHCR\'S planned attempt at re-registration to 
validate the actual number of refugees present in the 
camps had near violent results when the UNHCR 
representative arrived in Hol-Hol to announce the 
re-registration exercise in early February and was 
reportedly stoned out of the camp.  The re-registration 
has been put on indefinite hold, due to what Post views 
as Government posturing to receive maximum donor resources. 
UNHCR reports that the asylum status committee convened in 
Ali Sabieh to determine status for the approximately 8,000 
individuals at Aour-Aoussa transit center continues to 
make progress. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT: While the manner in which repatriations 
are taking place may not be transparent, the bottom line 
is a net positive for the USG.  Names continue to be 
removed from the rolls at a steady clip. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTIAN RESPONSE TO NEW U.S. LANDMINE POLICY 
AND VISION FOR REGIONALIZED TRAINING CENTER 
 
REF: STATE 43579 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1.  (U) POLOFF delivered the tear line of reftel to Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Senior Councilor Djibril Elabe on March 1, 
2004.  Elabe is the MFA representative responsible for 
Djibouti\'s demining portfolio and organized a \"way forward\" 
forum for the Djiboutian Humanitarian Mine Action Center 
(DMAC) after their January 29, 2004 declaration of \"Mine 
Safe\" status.  Elabe welcomed the new landmine policy as 
\"progress\" but lamented that it was less forceful than that 
previously proposed by former President Clinton.  Elabe went 
on to speak on his vision for the DMAC in Djibouti as a 
regional training center working in collaboration with the 
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD).  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
U.S. LANDMINE POLICY 
-------------------- 
 
2. (U) Elabe described President Bush\'s new landmine policy 
as \"progress.\"  He posed numerous questions on the life 
expectancy of \"temporary\" mines as opposed to \"persistent\" 
mines and whether the U.S. would make this mine technology 
available to developing countries.  He lamented that 
President Bush\'s landmine policy seemed less forward than 
that proposed by former President Clinton. 
 
DMAC FORUM 
---------- 
 
3. (U) Djibouti\'s Humanitarian Demining Program declared the 
country of Djibouti \"Mine Safe\" on January 29, 2004.  The 
program was funded by the Department\'s Political/Military 
Demining section and oversight was provided by RONCO 
contractors.  With the completion of the program, and the 
financing, the MFA organized a forum to examine the future of 
the demining center in Djibouti and ways forward.  POLOFF was 
invited to make remarks at the forum and after offering 
congratulatory remarks focused on four points; that their was 
still some unexploded ordinance (UXO) work for the deminers 
to finish within their borders, that the forum should examine 
how to integrate civil society into what had to this point 
been a uniquely military organization, that the forum needed 
to implement mechanisms that would protect the resources and 
structure of the DMAC from other under-resourced Government 
institutions, and that most importantly the way forward 
rested on the reputation of the DMAC, which had to date 
suffered no casualties in its work, and should not be asked 
to operate outside its mandate or training in bomb disposal 
for example. 
 
THE WAY AHEAD 
------------- 
 
4. (U) Elabe noted that an agenda of recommendations had been 
born at the DMAC forum and that he would forward a copy to 
POLOFF.  He continued that he thought with the current 
turbulent environment in the Horn of Africa region the DMAC 
could serve a valuable role as a regional training center for 
other demining operations.  He pointed specifically to what 
he hoped was approaching peace in Sudan and the need for 
demining operations there.  He spoke about the potential for 
Sudanese deminers to come to Djibouti, perhaps through the 
auspices of IGAD, to be trained in Djibouti and perhaps 
partner with Djiboutian deminers in demining efforts in the 
region.  POLOFF commented that he was unsure of IGAD\'s 
mandate but that he would pass the idea on as one of merit. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 5. (U) Djibouti\'s response to President Bush\'s new landmine 
policy was positive if muted.  Elabe seized the opportunity 
to pursue Djibouti\'s agenda to identify a regional role for 
its Humanitarian Demining Program which is now without 
revenue and at risk of being cannibalized by the 
under-resourced military.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI SPECTACLE AT PELTIER HOSPITAL 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (U) Djibouti\'s Minister of Health, Mohamed Ali Kamil, 
along with French Ambassador Phillipe Selz, inaugurated on 
March 7 a new wing at Djibouti\'s public hospital, Peltier. 
The French financed surgical wing also has UN HIV/AIDS blood 
testing equipment and an imaging scanner donated by 
Djibouti\'s first lady, Kadra Haid.  Djiboutian President 
Ismail Omar Guelleh attended with his remarkable security 
entourage in tow. End Summary. 
 
THE EVENT 
--------- 
 
2. (U) Djibouti\'s Minister of Health, Mohamed Ali Kamil, 
invited Djibouti\'s political cream to attend an inauguration 
ceremony for a new wing at the capital city\'s public 
hospital, Peltier, located only five hundred yards from the 
U.S. Embassy.  Kamil, the acting UN resident representative, 
UNICEF Director Keith Mckenzie, and the French Ambassador, 
Phillipe Selz, all spoke.  Kamil and Mckenzie both offered 
forward leaning words on Djibouti\'s HIV/AIDS efforts.  Selz, 
in his first Djiboutian public appearance, concentrated on 
continued French commitment to Djibouti. 
 
PELTIER 
------- 
 
3. (U) A vestige of French colonial occupation, Djibouti 
City\'s public hospital\'s roots date back to 1897 and the 
creation of a health unit for the French \"Enterprise Generale 
de Construction\" charged with building the Djibouti-Ethiopian 
railway.  The hospital takes its name from the French Chief 
Doctor who directed it from the 1930\'s until his death in 
1955.  Hospital officials report that Peltier has a capacity 
of 603 beds of which 401 are functional.  Amongst locals and 
expats alike the Peltier of today has a poor reputation.  In 
recent years, the \"Cooperation Francaise\" has diminished its 
human resource presence at the hospital to almost zero. 
This, in conjunction with poor administration and 
questionable budgetary allocations, has led to the rapid 
deterioration of facilities and services.  Nearly all of 
Peltier\'s 45 state employed physicians run private, 
unlicensed clinics out of their homes, reportedly with public 
Peltier resources.  Embassy FSNs report that Peltier is 
viewed as a \"last resort\" if locals do not have the financial 
means to pay for private or French military services. 
 
4. (U) In spite of these shortcomings, the new 263 million 
Djibouti Franc (nearly 1.5 million U.S.$) French financed 
surgical wing is impressive.  The imaging scanner (to perform 
MRI\'s for example) donated by Djibouti\'s first lady is the 
first of its kind in Djibouti\'s public sector.  The blood 
screening equipment that is part of the UN-funded AIDS 
campaign is technologically critical to Health Minister 
Kamil\'s announcement that Djibouti will begin retroviral 
treatment for its \"3%\" infected AIDS population. The question 
that UN and Embassy health workers ask remains one of 
maintenance and upkeep for these pricey additions to the 
maligned institution. 
 
A PRESIDENTIAL APPEARANCE 
------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) President Guelleh arrived at the slated 9:00 a.m. 
ceremony in royal fashion.  The hospital site, located on the 
exclusive Heron peninsula between the French and U.S. 
Embassies, was closed to the public several hours before the 
ceremony began by approximately 200 of the President\'s elite 
\"Republican Guard.\"  The sharply dressed Guard (in U.S. 
styled custom battle dress uniforms) occupied critical 
rooftop sniper locations and provided perimeter security for 
the event.  At 9:30 the first lady arrived with her two 
vehicle escort and 8 body guards to chants and drumming from 
her pre-installed cheering section.  At 9:45 8 shiny BMW 
motorcycles roared into the hospital compound with blaring 
horns and flashing lights to clear the path for the 
President\'s motorpool.  The lead GMC suburban dusted the 
seated crowd as two snipers jumped from the rear jump 
platform and a cadre of body guards in Nyerere-style African 
two piece suits with secret service ear plugs secured the red 
carpet for Guelleh\'s Mercedes sedan.  The trail GMC suburban 
then unloaded its body guards who secured the President\'s 
exit and approach to the seated assembly.  When Guelleh was 
seated in his cushioned recliner an aide installed a coffee 
table in front of him and served him a glass of chilled water 
covered in foil and a cup of coffee in gold plated trim. 
POLOFF counted 18 personal bodyguards attached to the 
President in addition to the motorcycle escort and the 
Republican Guard. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (U) The inauguration ceremony presided over by Peltier 
Director Aden Mohamed Dileita, brother of Prime Minister 
Dileita Mohamed Dileita, was impressive.  The modern 
equipment and progressive speeches on HIV/AIDS were 
heartening.  Having visited patients at Peltier previously 
however, one wonders if resources to maintain the new 
facilities and equipment will be available.  It is not clear 
if or how much of France\'s investment in the wing will be 
devoted to maintenance.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: INVESTMENT IN DJIBOUTI DOMINATED BY ARAB WORLD 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: President\'s Advisor on Investment, 
Fahmi Ahmed Al-Hag, says Djiboutians favor Arab 
development funds over western funds because of the 
simplicity of their financing procedures.  Al-Hag 
detailed the current investments to Djibouti from the 
Arab world.  He twice commented that both the 
Government of Djibouti and Arab donor nations would 
like to pursue a triangular development approach for 
Djibouti; financing from the Arab donors, planning 
and technical expertise from the U.S. and Djiboutian 
cooperation. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) PolOff met with Mr. Fahmi Ahmed Al-Hag, the 
President\'s Advisor on Investment, to discuss the 
general investment climate in Djibouti and the recent 
development project proposed by a private Saudi 
investor in the Haramous region of Djibouti City - a 
proposed site for the New Embassy Compound.  Mr. 
Al-Hag was pleased to discuss the general investment 
climate in Djibouti, though he clarified that he 
could only comment on the Arab portfolio, which he 
has covered since 1979.  Mr. Al-Hag indicated that 
most investment and economic cooperation is with 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. 
Funding is most often provided by the Saudi 
Development Fund, Kuwaiti Development Fund, the Arab 
Fund for Economic and Social Development (FADES) and 
OPEC funds.  Mr. Al-Hag indicated that while Djibouti 
is not devoid of Western donor activity, it prefers 
funds from Arab donors because of the simplicity in 
its financing procedure and quick release of funds 
after approval. 
 
ARAB DEVELOPMENT FUNDS JOIN TOGETHER 
------------------------------------ 
3. (U) In May 2000, the Djiboutian government hosted 
a meeting with several Arab donors to negotiate and 
plan a joint development program for Djibouti\'s most 
pressing needs.  Donors included the Saudi Development 
Fund, Kuwaiti Development Fund, FADES, Abu Dhabi 
Development Fund, Islamic Development Bank and OPEC 
Fund.  The program focuses on energy, education, 
housing, health, water resources and transportation 
infrastructure to be built and improved over five 
years.  Totaling US$ 200 million, the program spans 
2001-2006 with a low-interest, long-term repayment 
over 25 years. 
 
4. (U) The $200 million covers six new generators 
for the energy sector; the construction of 2000 new 
housing units to aid the shortage of homes; $25 million 
to the education sector - mainly focused on the 
construction of new buildings and refurbishment of 
existing structures; $5 million for the health sector, 
an initial investment in the Djiboutian Economic 
Development Fund of $5 - to be followed by another 
$25 million from a separate donor program; 
paving and improvement on the 66 kilometer stretch of 
highway between Tadjourah and the northern city of 
Obock; $25 million to develop a container terminal 
to ship salt from Goubet, near Lake Assal, as well as, 
wind energy and desalinization plants to power the 
region; repairs and replacement of the water 
distribution network throughout Djibouti city, which 
is the cause of a 25 percent loss annually of total 
water pumped; and a feasibility study on piping water 
in to the city from the Hanle region, some 200km from 
Djibouti City. 
 
DUBAI PORTS INTERNATIONAL EXPANDS TO DORALEH 
-------------------------------------------- 
4. (U) In addition to the $200 million economic 
development program, investment to expand the port 
is coming from the United Arab Emirates.  The current 
Port of Djibouti has reached capacity and due to its 
physical layout cannot be expanded at its current 
location.  At a depth of twelve meters, the cost and 
amount of dredging needed to expand the current port 
has ruled out this option.  Dubai Ports International 
(DPI), which  currently runs the Port of Djibouti, is 
building a new port facility to expand its shipping 
capacity.  This new facility will be built in Doraleh, 
some 18 kilometers from the outskirts of Djibouti City. 
The Doraleh Port Facility will have an oil terminal, 
container terminal and an economic Free Zone. 
 
5. (U) The aim of Doraleh is to diversify the port 
activities to extend beyond Ethiopian needs, and 
increase the volume capacity.  Doraleh has natural 
port depth of 20 meters, which will alleviate the 
need and cost of dredging. With an increased depth 
able to accommodate the newest generation of tankers, 
the Djiboutians expect several businesses resident in 
Dubai to be attracted to the strategic location of 
the less congested and newer Free Zone in Doraleh, 
Djibouti.  The ultimate goal for both the Arab 
investors and the Djiboutian government is to make 
Djibouti a regional distribution center.  Phase one 
of the facility is the oil terminal, coming to a total 
of roughly US$ 40 million and construction has already 
been started.  This is being funded by Emirates 
National Oil Company (ENOC) and DPI.  Phase two, the 
container terminal totaling close to US$ 300 million, 
is expected to be funded by private investors from 
Dubai and other Arab donors.  A feasibility study for 
this portion of the facility is being funded by the 
U.S. Trade and Development Agency (U.S.TDA). 
 
AN ECONOMIC FUTURE SURROUNDED BY SALT 
------------------------------------- 
6. (U) Lake Assal is fast becoming a hopeful hub of 
economic and energy potential.  In addition to the 
economic program\'s salt shipment facility, other 
mineral resources have been found at Lake Assal. 
The Bureau de Recherche Geologique et Minier (French 
Geological and Mining Research Office) has found 
evidence of high-quality perlite deposits in the area. 
Perlite is used in the refinement of oil and could be 
of great interest to U.S. oil investors.  The Canadian 
government financed a study to make the infrastructure 
of salt and energy development at Lake Assal more 
environmentally stable. 
 
7. (U) The Lake Assal region was the subject of a 
Saudi study in wind energy.  The study showed that 
winds are high enough eight months of the year to 
power the immediate region.  If combined with another 
form of energy, this could become a viable option 
for the Lake Assal area. 
 
8. (U) Geothermal energy is also a hopeful at Lake 
Assal with interest from private U.S. investors. 
Though this project has been in the works for several 
years, it is currently at a stand still.  Al-Hag 
commented that some Arab donors have expressed 
readiness to fund the project.  This was followed by 
the idea that Djibouti and the Arab donors would like 
to pursue a triangular cooperation on this and many 
other ventures. 
 
9. (U) Another possible source of energy that donors 
are exploring is importing natural gas from Yemen to 
Djibouti by way of a sub-marine connection at the 
mouth of the Bab El-Mandeb.  Electricite de France 
is the driving force behind this project, and 
according to Al-Hag, the Yemeni government has no 
qualms about the possible project. 
 
HARAMOUS VILLAGE - A STEP TOWARDS MODERN URBANIZATION 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
7. (U) The Djiboutian government estimates that over 
the next ten years, the housing market will need 
approximately 2000 new units per year to meet demand. 
One of the largest investments that will aid this 
shortage, outside of the 5-year economic program, is 
the residential/commercial development of the Haramous 
area of Djibouti City.  The Government of Djibouti has 
signed an agreement with a private Saudi developer, Mr. 
Mohammad M. Ali Yamani, to urbanize the 610,000 square 
meters that neighbors the presidential residence, the 
French military base, the U.S. military base and the 
Ambouli Airport.  At a price of $5.65 per square meter, 
the project will include all infrastructure, such as 
roads, water and electricity.  The urbanization plan 
includes 260 high-standing villas, a modern residential 
complex, a five-star hotel on the water, a commercial 
center and a recreational center.  The expected time 
until completion is four to five years. 
 
8. (U) This project is of special interest to Embassy 
Djibouti as Haramous is the area where a proposed site 
for a new Embassy Compound is located.  Though the 
Ministry of Finance is the only body with the authority 
to sell or lease land, the Embassy will have to deal 
with Mr. Yamani on various infrastructure related 
issues.  PolOff hopes to meet with Mr. Yamani on his 
return to Djibouti in a few weeks.  Details of the 
project will follow in a septel on that meeting.

Pol/Econ Off March 9th to discuss U.S. aid to Djibouti 
and ADB\'s plan for Djibouti.  Drame inquired about 
which areas United States aid would cover and asked 
how money given to Djibouti is managed.  He said he is 
tasked with coordinating with donors to better 
organize ADB\'s program to best help Djibouti.  Drame 
was very interested in whether cooperation between 
international donor organizations was happening and 
whether there were plans to begin such cooperation. 
Pol/Econ Off noted that the Ambassador has expressed 
a desire to begin a similar coordination. 
 
2. (U) Drame was especially concerned with the amount 
of money given to Djibouti in terms of military aid; 
how it was implemented, was there monitoring, and 
who controlled the money. 
 
3. (U) Drame commented that ADB has put on hold the 
seven million dollars earmarked for Djibouti because 
IMF monitoring has not occurred for over a year. 
(Comment: He implied that ADB would like to release 
the funds during a period of IMF monitoring to ensure 
proper usage. End Comment.)  Drame saluted the fact 
that the Government of Djibouti has put in place an 
entity dedicated to external financing within the 
Ministry of Finance.  However, ADB still feels that 
Djibouti has many weaknesses that need to be addressed. 
Drame indicated that ADB could offer only a small 
amount of assistance to Djibouti because of its 
performance record.

SUBJECT: RPP - RULING FOR 25 YEARS (AND COUNTING?) 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. A rally Thursday, March 4th celebrating 
the 25th anniversary of the Rassemblement Populaire pour 
le Progres (RPP), the ruling political party in Djibouti, 
marked the beginning of the campaign season for 
Presidential elections, scheduled for early spring 2005. 
Current President Ismail Omar Guelleh is already the 
favored candidate.  RPP\'s dominance in the political 
arena and the distinct lack of a real opponent highlight 
the fact that Djibouti\'s political system is only a 
multi-party system in spirit.  With the second-ever 
Presidential election on the horizon, Djibouti\'s system 
lacks transparency and a strong opposition. END SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN DJIBOUTI 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
2. (U) Djibouti has a population estimated at 600,000 
inhabitants from diverse ethnic backgrounds.  Somalis 
make up the majority of the population, followed by 
Afars and a minority of Arabs.  The population has 
ethnic, cultural and religious ties with Somalia, 
Ethiopia, Eritrea and Yemen.  A large number of 
French nationals are also resident in Djibouti, as 
well as Ethiopian and Somali migrants and refugees. 
 
3. (U) Djibouti gained its independence from France 
in 1977.  At that time, the government decided to 
keep a single political party in order to prevent 
disintegration and friction among tribal affiliations. 
The \"Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progres\" was born 
in March 1979.  Hassan Gouled Aptidon, the President 
of the Republic of Djibouti, was elected as the first 
president of RPP.  It soon became obvious that one 
clan, the Issas, were completely dominating the RPP 
leaving the remaining clans to be treated as second 
class citizens.  The situation became unbearable for 
the Afars, the second largest ethnic group, and they 
eventually formed an opposition party, the \"Front 
pour la Restauration de l\'Unite de Djibouti\" (FRUD). 
The political climate became so tense that in 1991 
the situation culminated in civil war. 
 
4. (U) In 1994, a peace treaty was signed between 
the armed wing of the FRUD and the government (RPP). 
It resulted in the first political alliance bringing 
together the RPP and the FRUD.  In the meantime, 
President Aptidon had created a new constitution for 
Djibouti which was finalized in 1992.  The new 
constitution lifted the ban on political parties, 
allowing for a maximum of four parties during a 
transitional period of ten years.  Two more political 
parties were then formed and created an opposition. 
In September 2002, when the transitional period expired, 
four additional parties appeared.  (Comment: In order 
to be legal a new political party has to be registered 
with the Minister of Interior, who also has the power 
to deny registration. End Comment.)  By January 2003, 
eight parties, grouped in two coalitions, were 
represented in the legislative elections. 
 
RPP\'S DAY IN THE SUN 
-------------------- 
5. (U) March 4, 2004 marked the 25th anniversary of 
the RPP, which coincided with its eighth 
congress.  The event lasted a full day, consisting 
of the election of the party president and the 
nomination of the Central Committee members, 
followed by festivities.  The Central Committee is 
made up of the heads of each district RPP chapter. 
Ismail Omar Guelleh, current President of Djibouti, 
was unanimously re-elected to another three-year 
term as president of the RPP. 
 
6. (U) In his inaugural speech, President Guelleh 
recounted the quarter-century journey of the RPP 
by stressing that it is the leader in the political 
arena, thanks to the efforts and courageous work 
of its members.  He added that the RPP made Djibouti a 
country open to the world, a country that 
accommodates various cultures.  Guelleh also mentioned 
that the RPP had brought people together by accepting 
their differences and only looking at their 
contributions.  Furthermore, Guelleh reminded everyone 
present that the world had become a global village 
and that Djiboutians should be prepared to listen, 
accept criticism and learn from it. 
 
7. (U) Guelleh renewed his support for providing 
adequate education and training to the youth, easy 
access to health for the entire population and 
advancing women\'s rights.  Guelleh recognized the 
need for assisting HIV/AIDS patients and their 
families, allocating 100 million Djiboutian francs 
(approx. US $570,000) to the cause.  Finally, Guelleh 
indicated that the RPP is committed to making numerous 
reforms in democracy and good governance, including 
holding regional elections in 2004.  He also committed 
the party to important development projects related 
to the fight against poverty. 
 
8. (U) The eighth congress of the RPP adopted several 
resolutions related to Somalia, the Palestinian 
Territories, Iraq and Sudan.  Regarding Somalia, the 
RPP renewed its call for unity, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity.  The RPP is in favor of the 
creation of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem 
(Al-Qods) as the capital city.  Concerning Iraq, RPP 
affirmed its solidarity with the Iraqi people in their 
right to obtain their sovereignty and territorial 
integrity as quickly as possible.  Lastly, the RPP 
asserted its full support to the Sudan peace process 
led by IGAD. 
 
9. (U) The afternoon was devoted to festivities, 
which included songs and a relay race from historic 
Dikhil to Djibouti City. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
10. (C) The RPP is the most dominating political 
party in Djibouti.  The other seven parties have 
little political influence.  Critics say it seems 
they lack real agendas or concrete plans to fix the 
problems of Djibouti.  Political pluralism exists 
only in theory.  In reality, the single party system 
is still very much alive.  Some say that Djiboutians 
who are unhappy with the way things are would still 
vote RPP because the opposition would be worse, as 
it lacks a plan for the future.  Presidential 
elections are scheduled to be held in early spring 
2005.  Guelleh has been making numerous public 
appearances in the past few weeks, leading Post to 
believe that he has started down the campaign trail. 
Guelleh\'s snaring of U.S. aid and engagement will 
undoubtedly figure prominently into his campaign.

1. (C) Djibouti\'s Foreign Minister Ali Abdi Farah told me 
March 10, during our meeting at the Foreign Ministry, that he 
will leave tomorrow for Nairobi to attend an IGAD Council of 
Ministers meeting March 12 on Somalia. He said Djibouti\'s 
Somalia policy remains one of finding a workable solution to 
the divisions that continue to plague that nation.  He 
affirmed close ties of Djibouti with Somalia, and especially 
with Somaliland, but said those ties should be seen within 
the context of the familiar social and family ties that 
naturally bind Djibouti to its neighbor.  He said Djibouti\'s 
actions should also be viewed as having a basis in its 
concern for the continued suffering of ordinary Somalis. 
 
2. (C) Asked about possible solutions to the fractiousness 
that characterizes Somalia, FM Farah responded that the 
concept of a \"federation\" of entities within Somalia, rather 
than the traditional concept of a unified state might achieve 
the best result.  Tribal tensions are too intense to make 
much else workable.  He recounted historic attempts at union 
that ultimately proved unworkable.  Yet he also said the 
\"stupidity\" of Somalis have contributed to the absence of 
peace. 
 
3. (S) I raised the importance of Djibouti using the close 
ties it has with Somaliland to put pressure on Somaliland to 
cooperate with us in the fight against terrorism, with the 
status of three suspected terrorists at the center of the 
battle.  FM Farah said Djibouti is \"willing to help\" and 
asked that we convey by diplomatic note this requirement. 
(Comment:  We will hold off doing so in order to vet with 
AF/E Gaffney during her 3/14 visit the appropriate language 
and whether this is the route we want to follow.  End 
comment.) 
 
4. (C) Asked about Ethiopia\'s relations with Somalia (writ 
large), he said he saw no genuine interest in Ethiopia to 
peace in Somalia.  Perhaps, he said, this is a consequence of 
Ethiopia\'s fear of renewed conflict in the Ogaden and a 
revival of other latent problems. 
 
5. (C) Comment:  Djibouti\'s continued role in a Somali peace 
is buttressed by its planned presence at the March 12 
ministerial and by the hope that the role can be 
constructive.  Perhaps Embassy Nairobi can use the 
Ministerial to further press on our specific terror-related 
objectives whilte also pressing for a galvanized effort to 
nudge all the warring factions toward peace.  End comment.

Reasons 1.4 (b), (d), and (e). 
 
1. (C) In a meeting with Djibouti\'s Foreign Minister Ali Abdi 
Farah on March 10, Farah contradicted information we reported 
(reftel A) that placed authority for negotiations on the Camp 
Lemonier base lease renewal within the Ministry of 
Presidential Affairs.  Farah also denied that Ambassador 
Olhaye would be his country\'s primary interlocutor. 
 
2. (C) According to Farah, negotiations would be \"led\" by his 
Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through what he 
called in French a \"commission\" (committee or commission) of 
four persons established for military coordination. The names 
of those members are M. Mohamed Ali Hassan, Director of 
Bilateral Relations in the MFA, Colonel Abdo Abdi Dembil, 
Defense Advisor to President Guelleh, Colonel Osman Soubagleh 
of the Djibouti Armed Forces, and Abdourahman Boreh, Economic 
Adviser to the President. 
 
3. (C)  Actually, the entity about which Farah spoke has been 
in existence since October of 2003.  This embassy received, 
in that time frame, a diplomatic note announcing the 
commission\'s establishment.  USLO Chief has met weekly with 
the group to coordinate on security assistance issues.  Boreh 
was not part of the original list and was only added the 
first part of January of 2004.  He continues to be the most 
active interlocutor on military issues. (See Reftel B) 
 
4. (C) Comment:  This makes three possibilities, and 
counting, for Djiboutian dialogue with the U.S. on base lease 
renewal. Despite the denials of Farah, though, we are 
hard-pressed to see talks without a role in some manner for 
Ambassador Olhaye.  He is present in Washington and is 
expected to continue his engagement.  If the confusion is 
indicative of anything, it is that Djibouti\'s own internal 
tensions over who will take charge of renewal talks will add 
another hurdle to those we must overcome as we enter what 
probably will be tough lease negotiations. End comment.

SUBJECT: BUSES STRIKE IN PROTEST OF FUEL COSTS 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Officer Erinn Reed for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) On Saturday, March 13, the Buses\' Union 
members went on strike, causing a total disruption 
of the bus transportation in the capital city of 
Djibouti.  The overwheming majority of the 
inhabitants in the capital rely on bus 
transportation, primarily in the form of 11 or 21 
passenger minivans.  The strike was made to protest 
the increase of diesel fuel, which has gone from 
DJF 71 to DJF 100 (approximately 40 cents to 56 
cents) per liter within the last four years.  The 
bus drivers are blaming the government for the 
high cost of fuel because of the close to 100 
percent tax levied on diesel fuel.  An additional 
reason that contributed to the strike is the 
recent decision by the mayor of Djibouti City 
to deviate the bus route from the road passing in 
front of the high school, which was convenient for 
both buses and students. 
 
2. (U) Students, who also rely almost wholly on 
buses, joined the strike because they missed their 
classes.  Some students threw stones at private 
car owners who refused to give them rides.  Others 
blocked roads by burning tires and other materials. 
The police responded with tear gas and 
confrontations with the students.  The Government 
did not make offical reports of injuries, but there 
were light injuries on both sides.  The mayor of 
Djibouti City strongly condemned the strike, 
indicating that the Buses\' Union did not inform the 
Ministry of Interior in advance, as required by law 
for protests.  The buses returned to work the next 
day, Sunday, March 14th, while still in 
negotiations with the Government. 
 
3. (C) In discussing the strike with Captain 
Abdoullahi Youssouf of the Djiboutian army, 
Emboff asked why there were still a few 
buses running and if those individuals would be 
alienated by the striking drivers.  Youssouf 
responded that they were already a part of a 
separate faction and in fact probably had more 
to do with the strike than the increase in 
diesel fuel.  He went on to explain that 
certain high ranking members of the Djiboutian 
security apparatus, specifically the police 
force, owned a number of the buses used in the 
route taxi business.  These taxis, he explained, 
were exempt from the constant harrassment many 
bus drivers faced from the police for payment 
of registration or license or whatever other 
fine of the day was in vogue.  He continued on 
that these \"protected\" taxis were also usually 
uninsured and protected from any liability. 
These issues, in conjunction with the raise 
in diesel prices, had driven other drivers to 
the streets. 
 
5. (U) COMMENT: Buses charge DJF 40 (23 cents) 
for one trip.  The government fixes this rate 
because buses are the only means of 
transportation for most of the inhabitants of 
Djibouti City.  In addition, many people would 
not be able to afford bus transportation if 
the rate was increased and would protest. 
While the general bus strike only lasted one 
day and the uprising of students was quickly 
dispersed, the situation made government 
authorities nervous.  The situation could have 
quickly degenerated into further unrest.  If 
the price of diesel continues to climb, the 
Government will need to find a lasting solution 
or face incidents of protest.  The strikes are 
another example of the frustrations that 
accompany increased competition, rising fuel 
prices, and inconsistent regulation in Djibouti.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C) Emboff met Djiboutian Army Captain Abdullahi Youssouf 
for coffee on March 13.  The primary focus of the meeting was 
to gain insight into the status of recent Djiboutian military 
discontent (see reftel).  Conversation also touched on the 
railroad explosion in the late evening of March 12.  The 
consensus upon discussion of the topics was that the 
Djiboutian military pay problem was quieted for the moment 
but not resolved and that the railroad attacks were becoming 
increasingly embarrassing but remained largely a mystery. End 
Summary. 
 
MILITARY DISCONTENT 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a conversation on March 13 with Djiboutian Army 
Captain and Commander of the Djiboutian Demining program, 
Captain Abdullahi Youssouf, Emboff sought to get an update on 
the reported (see reftel) discontent amongst the rank and 
file military in the country\'s interior.  Youssouf confirmed 
that the military units in the districts of Dikhil, Obock, 
and Tadjoura had refused to accept their salaries on February 
28 due to a paycut from the Chief of Staff.  Youssouf 
commented that Djiboutian Chief of Staff General Fahti was 
forced into this decision by the Minister of Finance, Elmi 
Bouh, who continued to cut the resources made available to 
the Djiboutian military.  Youssouf noted that while 
intervention by senior military officers in the districts and 
with the Presidency had calmed nerves and resulted in a 
restoration of that month\'s salary cut no one had seen a 
budgetary restoration at the level of the Ministry of 
Finance.  Soldiers and officers alike were unsure how events 
would play out at the end of this month when the same crisis 
will arise. 
 
3. (C) When Emboff queried Youssouf on the possibility that 
the new \"Civilian Corps\" proposed by President Guelleh had 
placed undue financial strains on the military tasked with 
training them, Youssouf replied that this was not the case. 
Youssouf commented that the new project was funded 
independently.  He said the project is aimed at engaging some 
of Djibouti\'s unemployed and undereducated youth.  It will 
train 2,000 Djiboutian youth in basic vocational skills over 
the course of two years and then reinsert them into the 
Djiboutian economy.  The military is charged with the initial 
\"formation\" of the pilot group of 500 youth in order to 
instill \"discipline\", according to Youssouf.  After their 
basic training course with the military the youth will be 
assigned to one of any number of Djiboutian public 
institutions from the Telecom to his own military engineering 
unit in order to gain a trade or skill.  During the two year 
apprenticeship the government has committed to feeding the 
youth and paying them a 10,000 DF (approx. $60 U.S.) per 
month stipend. 
 
RAILROAD EXPLOSION 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) The latest in what has become regular bombings of the 
Djibouti-Ethiopia railway occurred in the late evening of 
March 12.  The detonation took place in Djibouti city not far 
from where the railroad passes behind the French Military 
Hospital.  The charge was placed on the track itself and 
detonated only three minutes after the passing of the train 
according to sources.  USLO chief received reports that a 
piece of the steel rail landed near a convenience store 
several hundred meters from the detonation, implying a degree 
of professionalism in the placement of the charge.  No one 
was injured in the blast.  Captain Youssouf commented that 
since the Djiboutian authorities had taken extra precautions 
to protect the train itself from attack the \"terrorists\" were 
clearly now expanding their sabotage efforts to the rail. 
(Comment: Mission officers have not noted the \"extra 
precautions\" to which Youssouf refers. End Comment)  He said 
that he was under significant pressure from above to respond 
to such incidents but was uncomfortable with the degree of 
training his deminers had to handle such ordinance.  His 
sense was that the more \"embarrassed\" Djiboutian leadership 
became over their inability to solve the 
intelligence/investigative riddle these ongoing bombings 
posed, the more pressure he and his mid-tier colleagues would 
continue to feel.  Hypotheses for motive range from 
disgruntled ethnic Oromos expelled in the Government\'s latest 
immigration policy to Ethiopian Government complicity to 
support their trucking industry.  In any scenario, Mission 
security personnel do not feel this issue impacts directly on 
U.S. interests. 
BIO 
--- 
 
5. (C) Captain Youssouf is an impressive up and comer in the 
Djiboutian Armed Forces.  He was the driving force behind the 
successful completion of Djibouti\'s demining campaign and 
their declaration of \"mine safe\" status.  He is 34 years old 
and married with two children. His Father was Afar and his 
mother Issa.  He speaks Somali, some Afar, French, and good 
English.  He is close to and well respected by General 
Zakaria, the Djiboutian Military number 2.  He recently 
returned from a tour of duty at Centcom\'s Coalition City in 
Tampa, Florida. 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) Budgetary differences between Finance Minister Bouh 
and former Police Chief Yacin Yalah Galab were at the heart 
of the 2001 \"Coup d\'Etat.\"  It will be interesting to watch 
events unfold as we approach pay day at the end of this 
month. 
 
7. (C) The saga of the Djibouti-Ethiopia railway continues in 
relatively benign fashion.  The most significant disruptive 
impact of the bombings is the interruption of vegetable 
imports from Ethiopia which directly affects the average 
Djiboutian consumer.  When the train is delayed or unable to 
transport vegetables the volume of vegetables arriving in the 
city decreases dramatically which drives up prices. 
Interestingly, it also diverts the remaining volume of 
vegetables that arrive to truck traffic.  Hence the rumors 
that truck owners may have an interest in disrupted rail 
service.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PRESIDENT SEES U.S. BUSINESS 
OPPORTUNITIES IN DJIBOUTI 
 
1. (U) Summary:  Said Omar, President of Djibouti\'s Chamber 
of Commerce, advises U.S. business to consider investment in 
Djibouti by a change in mindset. He implored U.S. companies 
to think \"can-do,\" to think about \"regional\" possibilities, 
to consider \"Doraleh\'s potential,\" and to see the potential 
in \"livestock,\" \"agriculture,\" \"computer chips,\" and \"AGOA\" 
as paths to economic opportunity in Djibouti.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) In an introductory call March 10 on the President of 
Djibouti\'s Chamber of Commerce, Said Omar, Ambassador asked 
Omar what potential advice he would give to a U.S. company 
interested in exploring business opportunities in Djibouti. 
She explained that one of her goals in Djibouti is to promote 
business opportunities and U.S. investment. 
 
3. (U) Omar responded that he would tell the U.S. company, to 
\"think can-do\" rather than \"can\'t do.\" \"Everything is 
possible in Djibouti,\" he said.  \"Only, there are challenges 
to achieving the possible.\"  An American company would need 
to have a great deal of patience, be able to communicate 
effectively with people, and be prepared to explore with 
their counterparts in Djibouti real options under difficult 
circumstances. 
 
4. (U) Omar also said a U.S. company should think 
\"regionally,\" rather than locally.  The market in Djibouti is 
rather small, he said, and the buying power is slim.  U.S. 
companies should look at investment opportunities that have 
appeal across borders.  Since there is much in common, 
culturally, with many of the citizens of countries 
surrounding Djibouti, appeals and tastes can be fairly 
similar.  Look for opportunities, he advised, where there is 
the ability to commit resources more broadly.  He noted that 
most businesses in Djbouti target the huge market represented 
by the sub-region of Africa and COMESA. For example, 
pharmaceutical products are shipped to Djibouti but airlifted 
to Ethiopia. 
 
5.(U) Third, Omar advised that U.S. businesses think about 
the potential posed by the Doraleh extension of Djibouti\'s 
port and the transformation of port activity that the 
extension will cause.  Already, he said, China is exploring 
setting up a free zone there to re-assemble vehicles. (Note: 
Post cannot yet confirm. End note.) He said the extension 
would make possibilities in the service and industrial 
sectors endless. 
 
6.(U) As a fourth point, Omar said he would advise U.S. 
companies to \"think livestock.\"  He talked about the 
popularity of locally-produced (Berberawi) sheep with Saudi 
consumers and said Somali-origin livestock had been stopped 
by Saudi Arabia, not because of fear of the outbreak of 
disease in that livestock, but by concern over Somali forgery 
of export certificates and documents.  After Djibouti\'s 
livestock project is complete, Omar said, (in reference to 
the work USAID is doing in Djibouti),\"the Chamber will invite 
livestock importers from Gulf countries to convince them to 
lift the ban on livestock.\" He said he believed many 
opportunities existed in the livestock field.  Admittedly, 
though, it would be difficult to make local processing 
profitable as most consumers regionally prefer their meat 
fresh-killed. 
 
7. (U) Fifth,  Omar said he would ask U.S. companies to 
\"think agriculture.\"  He stated his belief that the soil can 
bear fruit in Djibouti.  What is lacking, he continued, is 
water. He added that the Israelis are experts in the area of 
drip irrigation and perhaps that process could be tailored to

8. (U) Omar said he would also encourage U.S. companies to 
\"think computer chips.\"  This is an area where even 
production is possible, he claimed. Omar said in passing that 
he believed advantage could be taken, additionally, of the 
Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) to further promote 
economic investment. 
 
9. (U) Comment:  Djibouti has significant infrastructure 
development and human resource shortfalls that are daunting 
for investors. Yet Omar has a point that the potential exists 
and that creative thinking is needed to uncover opportunities 
and overcome obstacles.  Post will continue to explore 
options to share with Washington, working with the Chamber of 
Commerce, and other entities in Djibouti.  End comment.

1. (C) Ambassador conveyed reftel demarche on Haiti March 14 
to Minister of Cooperation, Mohamoud Youssef Ali, in 
Djibouti\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Ali stated that 
Djibouti stands firmly with the United States in the 
conviction that President Aristide\'s departure was for the 
good of Haiti and the Haitian people, who have suffered a 
great deal over the past few decades. 
 
2. (C) Ali added that from Djibouti\'s perspective, it is 
unimportant whether Aristide left office on his own accord, 
or was encouraged or forced to leave.  What is important is 
that his departure is for the good of Haiti and there is no 
need to create a larger issue.  He said he was unsure of the 
motivations of South Africa in seeking to raise debate over 
the circumstances of Aristide\'s departure, but that Djibouti 
sees no point in the issue being broached at the Arab League 
level. Ali agreed that efforts now should be focused on the 
restoration of order in that troubled country and a 
commitment to the early establishment of a 
democratically-elected government.

 1. (C) Chinese development activity in Djibouti has been 
robust, with major projects as well as feasibility studies, 
minor projects and assistance for renovation of existing 
facilities.  Major projects include a sports stadium built in 
between 1991 and 1993 at a cost of USD 11 million (loan) and 
another stadium project to begin later this year.

Djibouti: 
 
-- 1983/85   Construction of the Palais du Peuple (People\'s 
Palace) USD 10 million (loan).

3. (C) Cooperation between China and Djibouti has been widely 
covered in \"La Nation\" over the ensuing years, and has been 
described as \"exemplary.\"  In Ambassador\'s meeting earlier 
this week with Mohamoud Youssef Ali, Minister of Cooperation 
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ali touted Chinese 
participation in the development of Djibouti. He has 
commented previously that he believes that a cooperation 
mechanism between major donors on economic assistance to 
Djibouti would be extremely beneficial. 
 
4. (C) Comment:  Post notes that China is providing on 
occasion a kind of economic assistance, through grants, that 
Djibouti\'s government favors over loans.  According to Ali, 
Djibouti has \"limited capacity\" to service loans.  In his 
meeting with Ambassador, he cited Gulf states that in the 
past gave bilateral assistance to Djibouti but who now prefer 
multilateral assistance via loans.  He admits that those 
states have been deeply affected economically by the first 
Gulf war in 1990 and want better control over how aid money 
is ultimately used. End comment.

 1. (U) Shen Jiangkuan, China\'s new envoy in Djibouti, 
presented his credentials March 15 to President Ismail Omar 
Guelleh. In his credentialling remarks, Shen described 
Djibouti as a country which has contributed to the promotion 
of peace and development in the region.  He said Djibouti has 
achieved stability, national unity and economic growth and 
has become an \"oasis of peace\" in the Horn of Africa.  Shen 
looked ahead to strong Sino-Djiboutian regional cooperation. 
 
2. (U) Responding, President Guelleh assured the people of 
China of Djibouti\'s unwavering support for a single, 
indivisible China.  He gave China \"first place\" status in the 
world in terms of economic growth, conferring on China a 
\"powerful weight\" in international affairs.

Jiangkuan was born in 1946.  His diplomatic career began in 
1972 at China\'s embassy in Paris, where he remained until 
1975.  He was then appointed Attache at the Embassy of China 
in Niger.  From 1983 to 1987, he occupied the position of

SUBJECT: IGAD EXECUTIVE SECRETARY SEES NO CONCLUSIVE 
OUTCOME FOR MARCH 22 DJIBOUTI MINISTERIAL MEETING 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Marguerita D. Ragsdale. 
Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) Ambassador Attalah Bashir Hamed, Head of the 
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) 
Secretariat, cites two problems confronting IGAD after the 
 
SIPDIS 
March 12 Ministerial Facilitation Committee Meeting on 
Somalia Reconciliation, and in the wake of the March 22 
follow-up ministerial in Djibouti.  In a meeting at the 
Secretariat with Ambassador Ragsdale, at her request, Attalah 
 
SIPDIS 
said first, the four faction leaders who walked out of the 
session are directly challenging IGAD\'s desire for 
inclusiveness in the peace process.  They must return to the 
table in order for the process to be viable. 
 
2. (C) Second, the Nairobi meeting was to have launched Phase 
3 of the Reconciliation process, i.e. selection of Members of 
Parliament according to clan affiliation.  At issue is one 
article in the TNG charter -- the need for political leaders 
to consult with traditional leaders.  Some participants, 
Attalah said, want consultation to be the other way around -- 
at the behest of traditional leaders who in turn draw in 
political leaders.  Traditional leaders are seen as having 
greater influence at the clan level, while political leaders 
are viewed as in control only of small segments of territory 
and of manpower. Because of the impasse, which has existed 
for one year, IGAD is taking the position that Phase 2 has 
been \"completed,\" Attalah said, and \"preparations are 
underway\" for Phase 3. Yet this position continues to delay 
the peace process, he added. 
 
3. (C) Attalah said IGAD dispatched a team to Mogadishu just 
after the Nairobi meeting in order to convince those who had 
walked out to re-join talks. He said there is still no 
response from them and the team returned the same day with 
their report. In Attalah\'s view, peace in Somalia will only 
work when all agree to peace. At issue, he opined, is the 
proliferation and strength of \"hidden agendas\" by the Somalis 
themselves and by their allies. Those from Somalia involved 
in the process are not sophisticated politicians, but simple 
warlords.  Most have no idea about how peace conferences 
work. They think solely, he continued, along a single line -- 
that peace will mean the loss of their interests. 
 
4. (C) Attalah sees no significant outcomes from the March 22 
ministerial meeting in Djibouti, even though Ethiopia\'s State 
Minister for Foreign Affairs is on tap to attend. Kenya\'s 
Special Envoy Kipligat will also attend. Attalah stated that 
Kenya does not want to see any extreme measures taken in 
IGAD.  It wants to do all it can to preserve the fragile 
peace process.  Somalis are contributing to the fragility, 
Attalah emphasized, but Ethiopia and Djibouti are also 
contributing by \"playing a game\" with those they support. 
Both Ethiopia and Djibouti are also accused, he said, of 
running arms to Somalia, in spite of the U.N. embargo, the 
latter in coordination with Libya.  Ambassador mentioned that 
the  monitoring group created under UNSC 1519 is due to 
arrive in Djibouti on March 21.  Members are not scheduled to 
meet Attalah, but have programs at Civil Aviation, the port, 
and with Ambassadors of Security Council states present in 
country. 
 
5. (C) Despite his pessimism on Somalia, Attalah said he was 
pleased IGAD has succeeded in involving all its member 
states, plus the Arab League, the European Union and other 
international partners in the Somali peace process.  He said 
IGAD decided not to include Somaliland in peace negotiations 
and to respect its territorial integrity at the moment. 
However, IGAD has urged the international community not to 
recognize Somaliland as a sovereign state, since recognition 
may jeopardize the peace process.  The international 
community should continue, he said, to maintain contacts with 
Somaliland on humanitarian issues. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  Ambassador will meet again with Attalah for 
an assessment after conclusion of the March 22 round of 
talks. Attalah is pleased talks are taking place in Djibouti, 
having lamented privately to Ambassador that the presence of 
the Secretariat in Djibouti has in the past posed insuperable 
logistical problems.  These seem to have been overcome for 
Monday\'s meeting.  Nevertheless, the opening will take place 
at Djibouti\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a portion of 
Secretariat offices is currently under renovation. End

1. (S) Post convened a meeting of the Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) on 24 March, 2004 to review threat 
information as outlined in reftel.  The EAC discussed the 
potential of attacks on western targets and the addition of 
needed security measures to mitigate the threat.  Potential 
targets in Djibouti include the Embassy, the U.S. Military 
Base Camp Lemonier, and frequented establishments in the 
downtown area.  In addition, due to the recent death of 
Palestinian Hamas leader Sheikh Yasin, the potential for 
inspirational or revenge attacks by non-traditional terrorist 
groups or persons adds a new dimension to an already serious 
situation. 
 
2. (S) The EAC was composed of the Ambassador, RSO, ORA, 
USLO, MgtOff, ConOff, CLO and newly appointed Force 
Protection Officer (FPO).  The contents of reftel were 
discussed in detail and all parties agreed that current 
physical security measures at the Embassy remain sufficient 
to deter or disrupt, but not prevent, an attack.  The 
Ambassador will be requesting authorization from the Saudi 
Arabian Ambassador to reposition the US Embassy\'s concrete 
barriers on the Saudi lot.  The lot adjacent to the Embassy 
is owned by the Saudi Arabian Government and has been vacant 
for several years.  Although parking is not allowed on the 
lot, it\'s size and emptiness provides an unimpeded approach

Lemonier are aware of the current threat and will take 
measures IAW their SOPs.  US Military elements are also 
coordinating with the host nation and the French Forces in 
Djibouti (FFD) who have a formal defense agreement with the 
Government of Djibouti. 
 
4. (S) The American community has been living at a heightened 
level of threat.  The EAC agreed that due to the general 
threat of attacks against Americans world wide and the 
specific threat emanating from Hamas in the wake of the Yasin 
killing, it would be prudent to reiterate the need for 
vigilance and personal security measures.  In addition the 
Embassy will seek clearance on a warden message urging 
American Citizens to maintain a low profile and strongly 
consider postponing activities that involve large groups of 
Americans or Westerners.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The March 22 Intergovernmental Authority on 
Development (IGAD) Ministerial in Djibouti had three agenda 
items:  Somalia and Sudan peace processes, election of an 
Executive Secretariat and arrears of IGAD member states.  On 
Sudan, IGAD ministers are pleased at progress made in Kenya 
peace talks and are certain an Abyei agreement will be 
reached, enabling signing of a final peace accord.  On 
Somalia, the reconciliation conference is seen as a fragile 
entity that cannot move forward progressively absent return 
of dissenting warlords.  In remarks to Ambassador, IGAD 
Executive Secretary General Hamad Bashir Attallah made a plea 
for U.S. intervention and commitment at the political level 
and hinted at Ethiopian complicity in a bid to de-stabilize 
the Reconciliation Conference.  IGAD\'s current Executive 
Secretary was re-confirmed as Executive Secretary for a 
 
SIPDIS 
further four years and Uganda received much flack for an 
arrears amount to IGAD totaling USD 3 million.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador Hamad Bashir Attallah, Executive Secretary 
of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) 
Secretariat, briefed Ambassador March 25 on the March 22 
 
SIPDIS 
Djibouti meeting of IGAD ministers. Ambassador, along with 
other diplomatic corps members, had attended the opening 
session of the Ministerial, in which Uganda\'s Minister of 
State for Foreign Affairs, Augustine Nshimye (in Uganda\'s 
capacity as chair) outlined the progress of the Somalia 
Reconciliation Conference.  According to Attallah, three 
agenda items were covered in the closed session which 
followed: the Somalia and Sudan peace processes, election of 
an Executive Secretary of IGAD, and arrears of IGAD member 
states. 
 
----------------- 
Sudan and Somalia 
----------------- 
 
3. (C) On Sudan, Attallah said Dr. Mustafa Osman Ismail, 
Sudan\'s Foreign Minister, briefed on the Sudan peace process, 
stating that it is on track despite the lingering dispute 
over Abyei.  Ismail also said that the parties are studying 
closely the Danforth compromise proposal on Abyei. (Note: 
Attallah acknowledged the SPLM/A\'s acceptance of the Danforth 
proposal and said he believes Sudan will also accept. End 
Note)  Ismail said both the Government of Sudan and the 
SPLM/A were committed to peace -- a statement reiterated by 
Kenya\'s State Minister and Special Envoy Kiplagat.  The 
Kenyan minister urged in the March 22 session that the 
difficulty over Abyei not be exaggerated. 
 
4. (C) On Somalia, the Kenyan minister laid out the current 
problems with the Conference.  Kiplagat contributed, noting 
the controversy over the issue of Members of Parliament (see 
reftel) which precluded movement into the third phase of 
talks.  They noted that Somalis who withdrew in Nairobi from 
the process have still not returned, but said Kenya would 
approach the dissenting group again to urge a return to 
negotiations. 
 
5. (C) Attallah gave Ambassador Ragsdale a copy of a 
declaration sent March 19 in Nairobi to the IGAD chair, 
Ministerial Committee Chairs, the Facilitation Committee 
chair, the Secretariat, Partners Forum, and member states 
from certain Somalis threatening to withdraw from the 
Conference.  He said he and the IGAD ministers were very 
troubled by this document.  For the first time, so many 
prominent and influential members of the conference had 
signed and all threatened to withdraw.  The Kenyan envoy 
dismissed it as only a threat, Attallah said, but the concern 
among ministers remains deep. Ministers agreed to meet again 
in two weeks in Nairobi for further talks. 
 
--------------------------- 
A Plea to the United States 
--------------------------- 
6. (C) Attallah urged that the United States intervene now on 
what he called \"the political side\" of the Somalia conflict 
and in a direct way.  He said so many ask why America is so 
involved in Sudan and chooses to ignore completely what is 
going on in Somalia?  Ambassador noted U.S. continuing 
efforts to engage on Somalia and its financial support to the 
Conference.  Attallah countered that much of U.S. engagement 
is at the military level.  It has put in place a military 
organ to watch Somalia but not one to influence the political 
process.  America has to play a role, he stated, in the same 
way that Italy, Great Britain and the EU is playing a role. 
Britain, for example, has sent a high level special envoy. 
Attallah warned that Somalia could disintegrate into further 
chaos, become another Afghanistan or another haven for 
terrorists if attention to the political dimension is not 
paid.  He added that Somalis want the U.S. to be there and a 
U.S. presence is more important than its financial support. 
Attallah commented that the United States genuinely has made 
a difference in the Sudan peace process and believes that 
success could be a model for Somalia.  He also praised a 
statement the U.S. made three weeks ago on Somalia, claiming 
it was the first comment of this kind coming from the U.S. 
 
--------------------- 
Election and Arrears 
--------------------- 
 
7. (C) On the ministerial\'s second agenda item, election of 
the Executive Secretary, Attallah said Kenya had put forth a 
candidate to challenge him but eventually withdrew that 
candidate.  IGAD members decided, admittedly with some 
contention, Attallah said, that he would continue as 
Executive Secretary.  Attallah, a Sudanese national, will now 
serve an additional four years. 
 
8. (C) On the third agenda item, financial contributions and 
arrears, Attallah said a great deal of discussion took place 
in the ministerial over the failure of Uganda, since the 
establishment of IGAD, to pay any of its financial 
obligations to the organization.  He said Uganda owed USD 3 
million in arrears to IGAD.  The Uganda ministers present 
acknowledged the arrears, but tried to place them in the 
context of other arrears owed to organizations in which 
Uganda is a member.  Attallah said he heard no viable 
explanation for Uganda\'s refusal to pay.  The Ugandans made a 
commitment on behalf of their government to try to clear up 
arrears but had no real authority, according to Attallah, to 
speak for President Museveni.  The second worst offender on 
the arrears side, Attallah said, is Djibouti, which owes USD 
500,000.  Djibouti needs to demonstrate, he continued, that 
it is committed to IGAD by settling these arrears, especially 
since it derives considerable benefit from the presence of 
the IGAD Secretariat, including holding 50 per cent of all 
Secretariat jobs. Attallah added that Sudan, Ethiopia, 
 
SIPDIS 
Eritrea, and Kenya, by contrast, have been \"very faithful\" to 
IGAD. 
 
----------------- 
An Ethiopian Role 
----------------- 
 
9.  (C) Ambassador met separately at the Sheraton Hotel March 
24 with Yusuf Hassan Ibrahim, Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
the Somalia Transitional National Government (TNG).  Ibrahim 
stated to her that the IGAD ministers were worried most about 
the flow of arms into Somalia and pointed an accusatory 
finger directly and inflexibly at Ethiopia.  Ibrahim also 
queried Ethiopia\'s sincerity in wanting a successful peace 
process.  In Attalah\'s meeting with Ambassador, Attallah 
pointed out that all the signatories to the March 19 document 
referred to here were allied with Ethiopia.  In addition, 
Hassan Abshir Farah, TNG Prime Minister, who also signed the 
document, was recently relieved of his responsibility 
(officially, although he remains in the process because of 
his status as earlier signatory to the agreement) and now 
appears to be allying with the Ethiopia group, according to 
Attallah.  The same, Attallah said, applies to Abdallah 
Derow, Speaker of the Parliament for TNG.  Attallah, like 
Ibrahim, reiterated the importance of Ethiopia to the success 
of the Somalia Reconciliation Conference.  End comment.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Minister of Interior Abdoulkader Doualeh Waiss 
convoked Ambassador 3/20 to ask for U.S. assistance in 
Djibouti\'s preparations for its first-ever municipal 
elections slated for October, 2004.  Department will note 
that Embassy put forward in reftel a case for Economic 
Support Fund (ESF) backing of Djiboutian election 
preparations -- both municipal (referred to locally as 
\"regional\") in 2004 and presidential in 2005.  Waiss\'s 
request is the first, formally, from the government. 
 
2. (C) The Interior Minister said Djibouti would be 
interested in inviting international organizations, the 
European Union, and African Union and the Arab League, plus 
ambassadors and journalists in country to track the progress 
of municipal elections. The aim is to provide reassurance 
regarding the transparency of Djibouti\'s electoral system. 
He noted the role played by the country\'s Constitutional 
Council, which tracks elections and assures normal electoral 
procedures, and its National Independent Electoral 
Commission, composed of jurists, civil society and 
representatives of political parties with a similar mandate. 
 
3. (C) The Minister noted previous U.S. assistance to 
Djibouti for electoral assistance.  Specifically, the U.S. 
allotted in FY-02 the sum of USD 500,000 in ESF to support 
parliamentary and local elections.  (Comment: All but USD 
68,000 was eventually obligated and spent.  Embassy Djibouti 
awarded the remaining USD 68,000 to the Djiboutian League for 
Human Rights to conduct a voter education program on 
decentralization and voter rights. End comment.) 
 
4. (C) Ambassador told Waiss that she would be pleased to 
raise his request with Washington. In support of that 
request, she asked that he give thought to anticipated needs 
and provide a list of minimum requirements. Waiss promised to 
provide the document later in the week.  We will convey to 
Washington Djibouti\'s indications. AID Director Schulman is 
also exploring with appropriate AID units, possible democracy 
and governance programs, if available.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI \"SHOCKED\" AT CANCELLATION OF GERMAN 
PRESIDENT\'S VISIT 
 
 
1. (U) German President Johannes Rau cancelled his 
trip to Djibouti, scheduled for Wednesday, March 24th, 
at the last minute due to \"considerable and concrete 
personal risk to the President,\" according to German 
security services.  Rau\'s trip to Djibouti was the 
third stop in a three-country African tour, also 
including Nigeria and Tanzania.  Post, and most of 
the Djiboutian government, learned of the cancellation 
on Wednesday, the 24th, from Washington and French 
news sources.  Djiboutians Communications Minister, 
Rifki Abdoulkader Bamakhrama, responded to the 
cancellation.  \"There is no plot against any president 
from any country...There is no risk signaled by our 
security service.\"  German Ambassador, Dr. Helga 
Graefin Strachwitz, based in Addis Ababa, had visited 
Embassy Djibouti for a courtesy call to Ambassador 
Ragsdale, Tuesday, March 23rd, during which she had 
confirmed the intention of President Rau to visit 
Djibouti. 
 
2. (U) The purpose of Rau\'s visit was to meet with 
German troops stationed in Djibouti as part of the 
Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) 
operation, as a farewell gesture before he steps down 
this year.  Rau was also to meet with Djiboutian 
President Ismail Omar Guelleh to discuss issues of 
military cooperation, the regional situation, and 
anti-terrorism prevention.  This visit was to be 
the first by a German head of state to Djibouti. 
 
3. (U) Djiboutian news sources reported Wednesday 
evening that President Rau spoke to President 
Guelleh on the phone, conveying his apologies for 
having to cancel the visit.  The news sources did 
not expound on what, if any, other topics of 
conversation were covered.  The Thursday edition of 
La Nation, the government run newspaper, printed a 
heated response to the cancellation with the title 
\"Djibouti exprime son etonnement\" - Djibouti 
Expresses Its Shock.  This half-page article ran 
above-the-fold on the front page of the paper.  The 
article was nearly editorial in nature, with added 
punctuation to express sarcasm and disbelief, as well 
as, vehement language to express the reaction of the 
Djiboutian government, delivered through the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  According to the article, 
an MFA official expressed Djibouti\'s \"shock and great 
surprise\" at the cancellation, which was done 
\"unilaterally and without consultation with the 
Djiboutian government.\"  Later in the article, the 
author used the words \"And God knows how many heads 
of state and other important persons have passed 
through Djibouti, without fearing for their life and 
their person.\"  The article later states that the 
telephone conversation between Guelleh and Rau 
included mutual sentiments re-affirming their 
commitment to \"reinforce Djiboutian-German bilateral 
relations and coordinate their efforts to instill 
peace and stability in this region of the world.\" 
The author of the La Nation piece smoothed things 
over by adding at the end \"and that\'s how nothing 
can come to shake the good will between two friendly 
countries.\"  The comment may be tongue and cheek, but 
indicate a Djiboutian willingness to forget the incident.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: KPAO, OIIP, DJ 
SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI: INFLUENCE ANALYSIS 
 
REF: STATE 33359 
 
1. (U)  The following text was compiled in report form per 
reftel.  Begin text: 
 
DJIBOUTI 
 
Djibouti,s population is estimated at 600,000 inhabitants 
from diverse ethnic backgrounds.  Somalis make up the 
majority, followed by the Afars and a minority of Arabs.  The 
population has ethnic, cultural and religious ties with 
Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Yemen.  An important number of 
French nationals and Ethiopian migrants also reside in 
country.  Djibouti gained its independence from the French in 
1977. 
 
The country\'s mixed economy has little industry and few 
natural resources. Most people reside in Djibouti City where 
poverty and unemployment rates are high. Outside the capital 
city, the primary economic activity is nomadic subsistence. 
The part of the annual gross domestic product not generated 
by and for the foreign community is estimated at no more than 
$250 per capita annually.  Much of the country\'s wealth, 
education and influence are concentrated in the hands of a 
small elite. 
 
The Government (GODJ) limits citizens\' rights to change their 
government and restricts freedom of the press.  It also 
limits freedom of assembly, uses force to disperse 
demonstrations and strikes, and restricts freedom of 
association. 
 
Print, television, broadcast and electronic media services 
exist in Djibouti. Most, however, are state controlled. 
Accordingly, the President and his cabinet level officials 
figure prominently in the headlines, which are received with 
a degree of cynicism by the population. There is no confusion 
about the President,s complete control over the country,s 
largest media outlets. Post has good relations with the state 
media and can normally facilitate coverage of events that 
contribute to the positive portrayal of the United States. 
 
The main state run paper is La Nation. Published in French 
thrice weekly (Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday), its editor 
is Adil Ahmed Youssouf and its circulation is about 4,000. La 
Nation is read by most literate, metropolitan Djiboutians 
regardless of their political affiliation despite its role as 
the government mouthpiece. It is sold in newstands and by 
street vendors. Distribution outside the city is limited to 
the commissaires (district governors), school principals and 
teachers. 
 
Al Qarn is the Arabic version of La Nation and has the same 
editorial stance. Its editor is Moumin Hassan Barreh and its 
circulation is considerably less than La Nation because it 
targets the small Arabic speaking community and Arab foreign 
missions (Djibouti is an Arab League Member).  Al Qarn is 
published twice weekly (Monday and Thursday) and is available 
in newstands and with street vendors. 
 
Le Progrs is published in French on Mondays and is the 
governing party Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progres (RPP) 
propaganda paper. Its editor is Mohamed Hassan Ahmed and its 
circulation is about 300. It is available in newstands and 
with street vendors in Djibouti City, but outside of town its 
readership is almost non-existent. 
 
Local officials do not as a rule hold press conferences. 
Visiting U.S. officials are afforded the opportunity to 
address the press during/after meetings with Djiboutian 
officials or on site visits.  The Embassy often utilizes 
press releases to provide its information about U.S. 
activities to the press. A large percentage of Djibouti,s 
population is illiterate, hence TV coverage often reaches a 
larger audience than the print media. 
 
Djibouti has a state run television station that is regularly 
viewed between 7-9 p.m. countrywide. Radio Television 
Djibouti (RTD) is led by Director Abdi Atteyeh, although the 
President and Minister of Communications retain editorial 
control. RTD programs are broadcast in the local languages of 
Afar and Somali as well as the two official languages, Arabic 
and French. 
 
Although RTD has a strong audience among those wealthy enough 
to buy televisions, the most heavily watched programming in 
Djibouti is the French channel &Canal Plus.8  Additionally, 
Arab broadcasts from Egypt and Saudi Arabia including 
&Al-Jazeera8 reach audiences in Djibouti. 
 
Because of its small size and nomadic history, Djiboutian 
society has a strong oral tradition that naturally feeds the 
local popularity of radio. Radio remains one of the few 
cost-effective means for the population to gather 
information, and is often considered more trustworthy than 
other outlets. It also reaches more people per capita than 
any other medium. 
 
RTD,s radio division is popular and includes programming in 
news, education, culture and health. BBC Somali is also 
extremely popular. The IBB presence in Djibouti currently 
includes two FM transmitters and one medium wave radio tower 
and broadcasts are in French, English and Arabic.  Radio 
broadcasts in the Somali language would reach the largest 
part of the population. 
 
The divide between state and independent print press is a 
critical issue.  The  \"independent\" print press is often 
accurately considered more \"opposition\" than \"independent.\" 
 
Ralit is published in French each Wednesday and is the 
official mouth-piece of one party of the opposition 
coalition, ARD (Alliance Rpublicaine pour le Dveloppement - 
Republican Alliance for Development, President of which is 
Ahmed Dini). Its circulation is about 500 and its outspoken 
criticism of the government is popular with the general 
public. 
 
Le Renouveau Djiboutien is published in French on Thursdays 
and is the official mouthpiece of the MRD (Movement pour le 
Renouveau Democratique). Its editor is the well-known 
opposition figure Daher Ahmed Farah and its circulation is 
estimated at 1000. Openly critical of the Government of 
Djibouti, Le Renouveau Djiboutien is frequently banned by the 
government and Farah was recently imprisoned for charges of 
defamation of character levied against him after he published 
an unflattering article about the country,s number two 
military officer. 
 
The independent print press frequently serves a watch dog 
type role over government operations; however, it is also 
highly politicized.  That said, it is still a good forum for 
indirect promotion of American values such as human rights, 
transparency and democracy. Embassy interaction with these 
outlets is often a delicate political issue. We currently 
engage them through our Washington File distribution, with 
press releases and with invitations to background briefings. 
 
Djiboutians in general have extensive experience with the 
West, particularly the French.  Although some journalists are 
Western trained, the press corps is largely limited and 
unprofessional. Existing Djiboutian media outlets offer few 
opportunities for investigative reporting and there is no 
system for educating those interested in journalism.  The 
Embassy has found that it is most likely to ensure accurate 
extensive coverage of U.S. activities by providing the media 
with copies of prepared texts.  A few local journalists do 
act as stringers for international news outlets such as the 
BBC, RFI and VOA. 
 
Diifu is the only group in country actively pursuing the 
development of a truly independent press. A group of about 15 
enthusiastic young adults, Diifu hopes to one day publish 
regularly in Afar, French, English, Arabic and Somali. 
However, it faces many political and financial challenges. 
Post believes that support for Diifu is currently our best 
method of encouraging an independent press with broad access 
to many groups in the community. 
 
Aside from local media, one must note the active 
international media environment in Djibouti. Djibouti is the 
single largest per capita recipient of US foreign assistance 
in Africa and has the only US military installation on the 
continent (CJTF-HOA). Because of this important geopolitical 
position, the country receives the continued attention of a 
wide-spectrum of media. In addition to local media 
responsibilities in the last year, Post hosted such high 
profile international media as the New York Times, CNN, The 
LA Times, AP, ABC, le Figaro, USA Today, Radio France 
International, Fox News, BBC, The London Times and Reuters. 
Media responsibilities as they pertain to the Global War on 
Terror are shared with the Public Affairs section for 
CJTF-HOA at Camp Lemonier. Embassy Djibouti and CJTF-HOA PA 
currently have a good, cooperative working relationship which 
we believe promotes a unified message and broad range of 
coverage in the international media. 
 
Telecommunications Infrastructure 
 
Telecommunications remains one of the largest barriers to 
promoting information flow and business investment in 
Djibouti.  The country is well positioned to develop its 
internet connectivity and availability as it is home to a 
large hub -- the South East Asia - Middle East - Western 
Europe #3 (Sea-Me-We3) transoceanic cable connection between 
Europe and Asia.  The connection apportioned to Djibouti on 
Sea-Me-We3 is so small it is nearly obsolete, however.  The 
root of the internet connectivity problem is the inadequate 
telephone network in Djibouti and the high cost of telephone 
lines, which prohibit many from having dedicated land lines 
for Internet.  Problems with reliability of the lines also 
plague both internet and telephone communications. Internet 
access is rare in schools and businesses, although there is a 
small thriving group of internet cafes in the city. Although 
the price of internet service in Djibouti is still 
prohibitive, more and more educated youth are using these 
cafes to obtain their information. 
 
 
Key Institutions 
 
The Judicial System ) Very Important 
 
After independence, Djibouti retained in large part the 
French Napoleonic code judicial system.  The French did not, 
unfortunately, train any local judges and GODJ relied on the 
French judges for many years after independence.  A number of 
local judges were gradually trained over the years but the 
shortage still exists. 
 
The existing Judiciary does not operate independently of the 
executive branch. Promoting transparency and independent 
operations is a priority to eliminate executive interference 
as well as tribal influences on judicial decisions. 
 
Political Parties ) Very Important 
 
At independence, government opted to keep one official 
political party in order to prevent disintegration along 
tribal affiliations.  The RPP was born in March 1979 and Mr. 
Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who was President of the Republic at 
that time, was elected its first President.  Since its 
inception, one clan -- the Issas -- have completely dominated 
the RPP. In reaction, the second largest ethnic group -- the 
Afars -- formed their own political party, the &Front pour 
la Restauration de l,Unit8 (FRUD).  The political climate 
became so tense that it culminated in civil war from 1991 to 
1994. 
 
The Djiboutian Constitution, finalized in 1992, lifted the 
ban on political parties by allowing political pluralism with 
a maximum of four parties for a transitional period of ten 
years. By January 2002, eight parties grouped in two 
coalitions were represented in the parliamentary elections. 
However in the 2002 legislative elections, the ruling party 
coalition won all 65 seats, amid opposition claims of massive 
fraud.  PD programs must focus on political pluralism, 
grassroots democracy and transparency in order to promote 
free and fair elections. 
 
Government/Elections*Very Important 
 
Djibouti is a republic with a strong presidency and a weak 
legislature.  In 1999, the country elected its second 
president since gaining independence in 1977.  Ismael Omar 
Guelleh, the candidate of the RPP, won the election with 74 
percent of the vote. PD must target issues of transparency, 
free and fair elections and grassroots democracy in 
preparation this year,s first-ever regional elections and 
for next year,s presidential election. 
 
Security and Defense ) Very Important 
 
Security, defense and the Global War on Terror remain the 
thrust of many of our MPP goals and public affairs programs. 
Strategy includes highlighting our many anti-terrorism 
programs and trainings here including, ATA, mil-to-mil 
training and CJTF-HOA civil affairs projects. In addition, PD 
must continue to focus messages of respect for human rights 
and due process on security and defense services. 
 
NGOs ) Marginally Important 
 
The NGO community is small and has cordial ties but does not 
act in conjunction with the Embassy. While we believe that 
donor and NGO projects should be more closely coordinated, 
the NGO community is not a target for our PD activities. 
 
Academic Institutions ) Very Important 
 
PD Djibouti has an active relationship with the country,s 
only university, Pole University. We believe this to be one 
of our most important venues for engagement thanks to the 
demographics of the audience (educated Muslims aged 
17-27),and their enthusiasm for access to English language 
resources. While Post,s relationship with the student body 
is excellent, the relationship with the administration 
remains complicated because of the large percentage of 
funding provided to the institution by the French. 
 
In addition, one of our easiest entry points into the 
community is the English night schools, which have few 
resources or training but high enrollment from all walks of 
society. 
 
Many of our USAID programs focus on improving the quality of 
education in country, and many of our PD resources should be 
focused on highlighting that involvement with the Djiboutian 
educational system. 
 
Mosques ) Increasingly Important 
Despite the fact that the country is 98 percent Muslim, Post 
currently does not engage the religious community in an 
effective way. Two PD strategies for doing so include 
increased distribution of Arabic language materials and 
targeting grants to moderate Islamic groups in country. 
 
The American Community ) Increasingly Important 
 
Post provides American Citizen Services to US citizens in 
Djibouti and Northwest Somalia. With the addition of CJTF-HOA 
and its attached contractors, the American community serviced 
here has grown drastically.  The 2006 MPP focuses on better 
access to our American constituents with information on 
voting, passports, adoptions and other consular services. Our 
main strategy for doing so remains the Camp Lemonier 
newsletter, as well as public presentations at the Camp.

SUBJECT: POSSIBLE DIPLOMATIC FALL-OUT FROM CANCELED GERMAN 
PRESIDENTIAL VISIT 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 441 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Reftel conveys report of Djiboutian government 
reaction to cancellation of the March 24 visit to Djibouti of 
German President Rau.  Embassy notes that the German 
Ambassador to Ethiopia (who also has responsibility for 
Djibouti), Helga Strachwitz, expressed considerable concern 
to Ambassador over remarks to Reuters News Agency about the 
canceled visit that were attributed to a CJTF-HOA 
spokesperson.  These remarks appeared in a Washington Post 
article on March 24.  The spokesperson, when queried about 
the German statement of a threat, is quoted as saying \"that\'s 
news to us.\" 
 
2. (C) The Reuters-originated story was carried in condensed 
form in the media here, but the spokesman\'s remarks were 
re-interpreted in French as indicating U.S. \"surprise\" over 
the German claims of a specific threat against Rau. 
Strachwitz told Ambassador March 25 that in her meeting with 
Foreign Minister Ali Abdi Farah the morning of March 24, the 
Foreign Minister was pleasant but chastised Germany for 
having made the decision to cancel the visit on security 
grounds and stated to her that \"even the Americans were 
surprised by your government\'s allegations.\" 
 
3. (C) As customarily happens in situations such as these, 
the Reuters\' attribution was re-interpreted a second time in 
\"La Nation\" newspaper on March 25.  There, it implied that 
the \"U.S. counterterrorism group\" said it was \"not able to 
take seriously\" the threats against Rau.  Strachwitz stated 
to Ambassador that she believed the U.S. should issue an 
immediate refutation of its public remarks on the Rau 
threats, even moreso because the Djiboutian government was 
using those remarks as a basis to lambast Germany for 
cancelling the Rau visit.  She told Ambassador that there had 
indeed been a specific threat against her President, that the 
threat emanated from Somalia and that individuals in 
Somaliland being interrogated in connection with the recent 
attack on the German organization, GTZ, had revealed details 
of the travel plans, flight pattern, ground schedules, 
spousal plans, meeting plans, etc. of the Rau visit -- 
information that would not normally have been in the purview 
of the Somali individuals. It was on that basis, she said, 
that the decision was made to cancel the Rau trip. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador attempted to defuse the situation by 
assuring the German Ambassador that the quotes attributed in 
the local French press to the CJTF-HOA are not an accurate 
rendition of the spokesperson\'s remarks and that the U.S. 
Government has made no statement regarding the validity of 
the German allegations.  Ambassador also met with CJTF-HOA 
Acting Commander, Colonel Jeff Mathis, who re-confirmed steps 
taken to ensure full coordination with the Embassy on press 
matters. 
 
5. (S) Comment:  The German Ambassador opined that there may 
be a need for greater intelligence coordination so that there 
is no daylight on threat information.  Meanwhile, post will 
make clear that much of the confusion has been fueled by 
press inaccuracies.  End comment.

1. (U) SUMMARY: Djibouti was the site of a kick-off 
conference for the African Rift Valley Geothermal 
Development Facility (ARGeo) March 17-20, 2004.  The 
conference focused on energy needs in Djibouti, next 
steps for the exploration and exploitation of 
geothermal resources in Djibouti and lessons learned 
by Kenya and other geothermal experts.  The ARGeo 
project is a collaborative effort of United Nations 
Environment Program (UNEP), Global Environment Fund 
(GEF), and the German Development Bank (KFW).  ARGeo 
is designed to aid the Rift Valley countries in 
developing their geothermal energy resources within 
the public and private sectors.  The project 
organizers see Djibouti as a prime take-off point 
for the ARGeo program, as there has already been 
research done on geothermal resources, a private 
investor identified, and donor interest in the 
project noted.  The Government of Djibouti 
(GODJ) publicly expressed its commitment to pursuing 
geothermal energy as an answer to the high cost of 
energy, which stymies business growth and exacerbates 
high unemployment. END SUMMARY. 
 
THE DJIBOUTIAN PERSPECTIVE 
-------------------------- 
2. (U) The African Rift Valley Geothermal Development 
Facility conference opened March 17 in Djibouti. 
Pol/Econ and Econ/Comm Assistant attended all sessions. 
Acting Djiboutian Minister of Energy, Saleban Omar 
Oudine, made opening remarks and also read a message 
from President Ismail Omar Guelleh. (Note: The current 
Minister of Energy, Mohamed Ali Mohamed, is 
convalescing in France.  Oudine currently holds the 
position of Minister of Commerce and Industry.)  The 
Government of Djibouti (GODJ) has placed importance on 
reduction of poverty in Djibouti.  Both Oudine and 
Guelleh named reduction of energy cost as essential 
for economic growth and the fight against poverty. 
GODJ sees the cost of fuel energy as a major 
inhibitor to economic growth and diversification of 
energy sources, including geothermal energy, as the 
solution.  President Guelleh\'s message emphasized the 
importance of ARGeo to Djibouti\'s geothermal development. 
He also implored all Rift Valley countries to consider 
seriously and take advantage of the ARGeo initiative. 
The acting Minister of Energy re-iterated President 
Guelleh\'s request to the international community to 
assist Djibouti in its efforts to develop its 
geothermal resource. 
 
3. (U) Electricite de Djibouti (EDD), the Ministry of 
Energy, the Agence National pour le Promotion de 
l\'Investissement (ANPI) and experts from the Centre 
des Etudes et Recherche de Djibouti (CERD) presented 
the current state of energy needs and investment in 
Djibouti.  All electricity in Djibouti is currently 
generated by diesel fuel power plants.  EDD sells 
electricity at rates of 41 Djiboutian Francs (DF) for 
residential consumers, 51 DF for commercial users, and 
52 DF for bulk consumers (approx. 23, 29 and 29 cents 
US).  EDD quoted average total cost of production at 
around 20 cents.  Of that amount fuel costs are between 
seven and nine cents.  The bulk of the remaining cost of 
production is reportedly taxes on materials imported 
for production.  With the proposed geothermal power 
plant by Geothermal Development Associates (GDA), an 
American company based in Nevada, EDD could buy 
electricity at approximately half current costs and 
bypass the taxes on imported materials. 
 
LESSONS LEARNED AND ADVICE 
-------------------------- 
4. (U) The conference brought together major geothermal 
developers from all over the world to discuss the ARGeo 
program and offer insights to the GODJ on how to progress 
with geothermal energy.  Kenya was the most effective 
delegation as one of the first African countries to 
develop geothermal energy with private investment and a 
long history of government run development.  The Kenyan 
perspective promoted continuous but staged development, 
with the government bearing a significant portion of the 
exploratory risk.  Kenya emphasized the benefits of 
geothermal energy as a green resource and offered its 
assistance in the development process. The experts from 
Kenya commented that the best way to develop geothermal 
industry was to start with a small plant (5MW), train 
locally, learn early how the process works, and later 
move to a larger plant (30 MW and up).  However, the 
Kenyans and other visiting experts highlighted the 
point several times that a larger plant is always more 
economical. 
 
5. (U) Among the most salient pieces of advice offered 
by the Kenyans, was the admonition to provide an 
enabling environment for private investment by providing 
solid fiscal and legal regimes, as well as charging 
private investors low customs duties and taxes.  Kenya 
also emphasized the advantage of having private 
companies run power generating facilities, keeping 
government money free to fund other programs. 
 
6. (U) Closing session debates were contentious over 
the best way to develop geothermal resources in 
Djibouti.  One camp, which included the Djiboutians, 
promoted the \"start small and learn as you progress\" 
method to mitigate the risk of investment to the 
government.  The other side of the table, urged 
Djibouti to take the opportunity that was presented 
with the 30 MW plant proposed by GDA.  GDA countered 
that it would not have come back after 5 years of 
negotiation if it were not sure that the project 
would succeed.  GDA also assured GODJ that the full 
brunt of the risk of investing in Djibouti would be 
shouldered by GDA and its investing partners. 
 
HOW ARGEO WILL WORK 
------------------- 
7. (U) ARGeo is designed to provide access to 
information, experience, technical and material 
assistance; identify obstacles to development and 
propose solutions; identify financial mechanisms to 
manage risks; eliminate technical barriers; and 
reduce overall risk.  GEF, KfW and Italy have made 
US$ 1 million available for the preparation phase 
of ARGeo.  The program is expected to be active by 
early next year.  The project organizers stated that 
a team of experts would be visiting each of the 
eligible countries to assist them in preparing 
their proposals.  GEF requests that the countries 
then submit the proposals to them to be considered 
for funding and assistance. 
 
8. (U) Within the framework of ARGeo there are two 
funds that will assist countries in the development 
process.  The risk coverage fund will help reduce 
the direct cost to governments associated with 
exploratory and production drilling.  The transaction 
counsel fund will provide resources for governments 
to get the necessary technical and financial advice 
throughout the PPA and contract negotiations.  These 
funds will contribute a portion, not fully fund the 
projects proposed.  GEF emphasized that private 
companies chosen for projects should be able to prove 
that they have adequate financing at their disposal 
for all stages of the project. 
 
9. (U) Ambassador and Pol/Econ met twice at the 
Embassy with Martin Booth, President of GDA, and 
Stephen Hirsch, UNEP Geothermal Consultant, to 
discuss outcomes of the conference and private 
meetings to explore their vision of next steps in 
GDA\'s quest of a contract to develop geothermal 
energy in Djibouti.  Booth stated his belief in 
the continued interest of his company in pursuing 
the project, but that project financing remains his 
company\'s single greatest hurdle.  Ambassador 
suggested possible interlocutors for GDA in terms 
of financing possibilities, including some of the 
development funds of Gulf countries.  She also urged 
that opportunities with Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation (OPIC) be explored.  Booth pledged to 
pursue both options.  Ambassador also conveyed to 
Booth the willingness of the Embassy to do all that 
it could to support and eventual contract proposal 
from GDA to the Government of Djibouti. 
 
10. (U) COMMENT: At the beginning of the conference, 
the GODJ seemed unconvinced of the practicality of 
geothermal energy.  At the end of the conference, 
however, it appeared more convinced.  The GODJ stated 
at the end of the conference that it wanted ARGeo to 
be the framework it worked through to develop 
geothermal energy with private sector involvement. 
The GODJ also mentioned its interest in developing 
small-scale/ off-grid applications, such as small 
local plants that serve a specific area not reached 
by the main power grid. 
 
11. (U) COMMENT CONTINUED: There was contention 
between the GODJ and GDA on output capacity of a 
proposed geothermal facility.  The GODJ focused on 
perhaps a small initial plant generating only 5 MW 
of power.  GDA made clear, however, that it would 
not be interested in building a facility that would 
provide less than 30 MW of power.  The general 
consensus at the end of the conference was that the 
ball is in ARGeo\'s court, and that the Djiboutians 
are waiting for the first move to come in the form 
of an ARGeo funding and assistance package. 
END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: JUSTICE MINISTER SAYS HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTION IS 
KEY FOR DJIBOUTI 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Minister of Justice, Ismail Ibrahim Houmed, told 
Ambassador that he intends to take a more active role in 
human rights promotion in Djibouti than the Ministry had 
previously.  The occasion for Houmed\'s declaration was the 
Ambassador\'s courtesy call on him March 4 at Ministry of 
Justice offices. 
 
2. (C) According to Houmed, human rights remains an issue not 
only between the government of Djibouti and the country\'s 
citizens, but among individuals concerned with civil and 
political rights.  The Minister presides over the Ad-Hoc 
Committee on Human Rights, which he created in 2002.  This 
Committee, comprised of ten members, includes lawyers, 
teachers, a human rights organization members, a journalist 
and a physician and is well-known for its criticisms of the 
current Government, Houmed said.  The Committee is a neutral 
body that has participated in various seminars and workshops, 
and has invited African human rights groups to visit 
Djibouti. Now, Houmed continued, the Committee plans to 
undertake a major project to report on the current state of 
human rights in Djibouti. 
 
3. (C) The initial phase of this project is funded by the 
U.S. government, through the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti, and 
consists of organizing a conference to debate human rights 
issues.  A participatory approach is planned whereby the 
government, civil society, non-governmental organizations and 
the opposition will be invited to take part.  Recommendations 
made during the conference will be compiled and made 
available to the public. International organizations such as 
the African Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations 
High Commission on Human Rights.  The Ad-Hoc Committee also 
expects to complete a first-ever  human rights report on 
Djibouti produced by the Government of Djibouti.  This report 
will be accessible to the public and will also be shared with 
the African Union and the United Nations, according to 
Houmed.  The Minister stated that he hopes to establish a 
fully independent human rights organization in Djibouti in 
the long-term.  A final priority of his is the implementation 
of numerous human rights conventions that Djibouti signed and 
ratified, however, implementation will be subject to 
sufficient human and material resources, Houmed said. 
 
4. (C) BIO-DATA on Houmed:  Ismail Ibrahim Houmed is an Afar 
in his mid-fifties.  He began his professional career in the 
field of nursing in Djibouti and immigrated to France in 
1967, where he continued to practice nursing.  Ismail is 
reported to have done some university studies in philosophy 
while in France.  Prior to Djibouti\'s independence, he was a 
member of the \"Mouvement Populaire pour la Liberation (MPL),\" 
an Afar political party opposed to the \"League Populaire 
Africaine pour l\'Independance (LPAI), a pro-independence 
political party.  Later, Ismail was a founding member of the 
\"Front pour la Restauration de l\'Unite Democratie\" (FRUD), 
which entered into armed conflict with the Government of 
Djibouti in the mid-90s.  He left Djibouti afterwards, but 
returned in 2000 and was soon nominated as Minister of 
Justice. (Note: The Government of Djibouti wanted to show 
that it harbored no grudges against the opposition party, and 
put in place two FRUD members as Ministers in its 
organization: Houmed, and Minister of Defense, Ougoreh Kifleh 
Ahmed.) 
 
5. (C) BIO-DATA continued:  Ismail wrote a controversial book 
about his political journey, harshly criticizing the current 
regime.  His colleagues at the Ministry of Justice have 
indicated privately that Houmed is difficult to work with 
because of a tendency to be suspicious by nature, and because 
he lacks experience in administration.  He is still a member 
of FRUD, but reportedly does not have a strong connection 
with the party at this time.

CHALLENGE ACCOUNT ELIGIBILITY 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) In Ambassador\'s recent meeting with Mahmoud Yusuf 
Ali, Minister for Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Ali stated that he believed all U.S. criteria and 
standards under the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) were 
achievable for Djibouti.  Democracy, he said, is Djibouti\'s 
ultimate objective and it recognizes the need to consider 
most productive ways to achieve that. 
 
------------------------------- 
Progress at the Political Level 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Ali took pride in what he described as national 
reforms at the political level. He noted the country\'s 
progression from single party representation to four parties, 
and finally to a \"genuine, multi-party system,\" culminating 
in the intention to host regional elections in October of 
this year.   On human rights, he said a committee has been 
established to look at the preservation and guarantee of 
human rights.  In addition, Djibouti has \"no political 
prisoners\" and its prisons remain open venues for inspection. 
 
-------------------- 
At the Justice Level 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C) At the judicial level, Djibouti has moved forward 
toward judicial reform, Ali emphasized.  A \"concierge\" to 
control the workings of the judicial system has been set up 
and it is an organ that respects separation of state and 
judiciary.  In addition, a state inspection committee is 
already operating with a function to prevent delays in 
judicial matters. 
 
4. (C) Ali said Djibouti is also taking steps to improve 
quality, integrity, and efficiency of judges.  For starters, 
it is raising salaries in order to encourage better justice 
performance.  He lamented the lack of a sufficient number of 
trained judges in Djibouti and said Djibouti is asking 
countries with a similar language and culture to loan judges 
for perhaps two to three years.  Lebanon has already been 
approached as its Court of Appeals system is similar to 
Djibouti\'s.  Senegal may also be approached.  The Government 
of Djibouti has dismissed an option to use French judges who 
are at the end of their careers in France.  Ali said France 
already has great influence in Djibouti at the economic 
level, thus it was believed \"unwise\" to open doors to their 
influence at the judicial level as well.  He said Djibouti 
wants greater transparency in its judicial system.  What 
happened with the Exxon-Mobil case (subsequent change of 
verdict), is an example of the system\'s failure, in this 
area, Ali said.  (Comment:  We have argued that is an 
egregious example of justice poorly served. End comment.) 
 
------------------------- 
And at the Economic Level 
------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Ali noted reforms currently under way, economically, 
in Djibouti.  He also said that a closer examination of 
economic assistance by donors is needed to ensure they are in 
synchronization with government objectives.  Djibouti prefers 
a \"program approach\" to assistance rather than a \"project 
approach,\" Ali said.  Arab states in the past had bilateral 
assistance programs with Djibouti, but shifted to 
multilateral giving through loans at favorable interest 
rates.  Djibouti has limited capacity to service these loans, 
Ali added, but is grateful for their investment in 
infrastructure.  The Kuwait Fund, he said, has invested in 
Djibouti\'s port and other funds in its energy sector.  Now 
the Arab Fund is investing in housing.  He indicated that 
Gulf country aid to Djibouti has slowed considerably in 
recent years, adversely affected by the two Gulf wars.  Also, 
Ali admitted, loans are increasingly seen by the Funds as a 
better way to exercise control over disbursements. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Despite the optimism of the Minster of Cooperation, 
Djibouti has considerable distance to go to attain 
eligibility for the incentive-based supplement to aid called 
the Millennium Challenge Account.  While \"encouraging 
economic freedom\" and \"investing in people.\" as policy 
categories, would yield a more favorable report card, there 
is still too much room for improvement in the category of 
\"ruling justly\" to cross the threshold in the short term. 
End comment.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. (C) Recent worker discontent in Djibouti brings the 
spotlight back to the subject of workers\' rights in this 
commercial city-state.  The International Labor Organization 
has long maligned the Government of Djibouti for its labor 
policies but clever manipulation of key players, strong arm 
tactics, and financial clout have kept a lid on this 
Pandora\'s box.  Moreover, the Government has instituted a 
policy in recent years to install government appointed shadow 
unions in place of freely elected labor unions, and succeeded 
in efforts to fracture and weaken the legitimate labor 
movement.  The country has witnessed worker flare-ups in two 
key sectors of the Djiboutian economy.  Either President 
Ismail Omar Guelleh wants personal political recompense for 
his intervention in those flare-ups in light of upcoming 
elections, or his circle of trust has grown small and he 
views these outbreaks as potential security threats.  End 
Summary. 
 
RECENT EVENTS 
------------- 
 
2. (C) Per reftel A, March 13 saw public transportation shut 
down in Djibouti as bus drivers and bus owners protested 
increased fuel prices.  Adan Abdou, elected Secretary General 
of the Djiboutian Workers Union (UDT), told Conoff that the 
bus drivers had been trying to unionize for some time but had 
been forbidden registration by the Minister of the Interior 
and had been pressured financially by bus owners to keep 
quiet.  They lost patience as they saw their profit margin 
further diminished by a 4 DF increase per liter 
(approximately US$.08 per gallon) in diesel prices. 
 
3. (C) President Guelleh sent a negotiating team to resolve 
the problem.  The four member team consisted of the 
President\'s brother, Said Omar Guelleh, the President\'s son, 
Liban Ismail Omar, the National Security Advisor and Chief of 
Intelligence, Hassan Said Khaireh, and one of the inner 
circle members of the elite Republican Guard, Captain Mohamed 
Djama.  Sources report that the 4 DF price increase was 
immediately repealed and that the representatives of the 
striking drivers were promised a return to 1998 fuel prices. 
Kamil Hassan, Secretary of the opposition Republican Alliance 
for Democracy (ARD), former International Visitor 
participant, and key player in the 2001 Dini-Guelleh peace 
accords, told Conoff that when the Mayor of Djibouti arrived 
at the meetings he was dismissed perfunctorily by Said Omar 
Guelleh and told to mind his own business.  The State 
newspaper, La Nation, published an article on Monday, March 
22nd titled \"After the strike, Elections!\"  The article went 
on to comment that \"the bus workers have been in a profound 
identity crisis for years...and suffered from real anarchy\" 
before closing with the line that \"elections for an organized 
union within regulations will be held on Friday, the 26th of 
March.\" 
 
4. (C) Port employees report that a strike by the dock 
workers was narrowly averted this week due to the 
intervention of the Chief of Service for Human Resources 
Houssein Kasim.  Apparently tension has been brewing at the 
port between the aforementioned Said Omar Guelleh, Chief of 
Technical Service, and Dubai Ports International installed 
Director General, Dutch national Johannes De Jong.  Guelleh 
has long been recognized as the de facto manager of the port 
and is apparently bristling at some of De Jong\'s efforts to 
gain better control of the facility.  Workers, meanwhile, 
have a list of complaints that include the formal recognition 
of their labor union, some manner of medical and disability 
coverage, and the standardization of pay scales amongst 
different shifts.  Adan Abdou told Conoff that the workers 
were prepared to strike this week when Human Resources head 
Kasim brought it to the attention of the Director General who 
agreed to a negotiating session with the workers.  This, in 
turn, apparently irked Guelleh who preempted the Director 
General with an aside meeting with the workers on March 22 to 
address their concerns. 
 
LABOR BACKGROUND 
---------------- 
5. (SBU) The Government of Djibouti has a history of trade 
union repression.  The harassment of duly elected trade union 
officials as well as the establishment of shadow trade unions 
whose leaders are appointed by the government are chapters in 
what is now a decade-long saga.  The ILO has restricted 
Djibouti\'s access to international conferences due to the 
Government of Djibouti\'s interference in trade union 
formation.  Broken promises made to the ILO include 
reintegrating fired union members into their state positions 
and halting interference in union affairs with the creation 
of shadow unions. 
 
6. (SBU) Per Reftels B and C, in 1999 the Government of 
Djibouti disbanded the duly elected Union Djiboutienne du 
Travail (UDT, Djiboutian Workers Union) and Union Generale 
Djiboutienne du Travail (UGDT, General Union of Djiboutian 
Workers) and held a shadow congress which elected 
representatives recognized by the Government.  According to 
the \"old\" (read legitimate) UDT, those active in unions are 
regularly harassed and fear for their jobs and the safety of 
their families. 
 
7. (SBU) At the end of September 2002 after pressure from the 
ICFTU and the USG (including discussions of workers\' rights 
provisions under AGOA) the UDT (the largest national trade 
union Congress with 21 affiliates) was permitted to hold a 
free congress for elections.  This congress was composed of 
both the \"real\" UDT and the Government \"shadow\" UDT.  Ahmed 
Djama Egueh and Adan Mohamed Abdou were elected as President 
and Secretary General, respectively.  One month later, 
elements of the Government held a second congress and 
appointed Said Mamoud Hassan, the Minister of Labor\'s cousin, 
as the President of a \"shadow\" UDT. 
 
8. (C) Most recently, according to UDT Secretary Sulaiman 
Djama, the Government claimed that UDT Secretary General 
Abdou must step down due to his role as a ranking member of 
an opposition party.  In July of 2003 the elected President 
of the UDT made a private accord with President Guelleh 
stipulating that if Abdou was removed from UDT office the 
Government would permit all of those union members who had 
previously been fired from their jobs for union activity to 
be rehired.  This would occur despite Government officials 
having already committed to these actions in previous 
negotiations with the ILO.  Abdou was publicly removed by the 
UDT President after a press release made by Egueh. 
Unfortunately for Egueh, none of the UDT member 
representation accept his move and while Abdou still sits for 
meetings, Egueh has been isolated.  No one has been 
reemployed.  The movement is fractured however, which may 
ultimately have been President Guelleh\'s goal. 
 
GOVERNMENT VIEW 
--------------- 
 
9. (SBU) The Minister for Employment and National Solidarity 
Mohamed Barkat Abdillahi told Regional LaborOff in October, 
2003 that the only two legitimate unions in Djibouti were 
those elected in 1999 in the \"First congress where leaders 
who truly represent workers took control,\" and those that 
were again re-elected in October 2002. (Note: the Government 
called both of these congresses and hand picked the 
\"election\" winners. End Note)  The Minister believes that he 
has good relations with both unions and with the employers 
association (Note: He is one of the largest employers as he 
owns a large insurance company, AMERGA and a construction 
company, Concorde).  The Minister claims that the rights of 
unions have always existed in Djibouti and that the main 
problem he faces is that certain union leaders want to remain 
in power forever irrespective of the wishes of the workers. 
He also said that he \"deplores the attitude of the ICFTU-AFRO 
for its archaic and colonialist attitude that supports those 
who want to hold onto power.\" 
 
10. (SBU) Regarding the Government\'s desire to have UDT 
Secretary General Abdou step down, the Minister quoted 
 
SIPDIS 
Article 31 of the UDT Constitution as saying that leaders of 
the union cannot also be political leaders. UDT 
representatives interpret Article 31 of their constitution to 
read that no UDT official can hold public office and UDT 
office simultaneously.  They point to January, 2003 
legislative elections when their second secretary was elected 
to Parliament on the Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progres 
(RPP) ballot and subsequently stepped down from his UDT post. 
 Only after his election to Parliament did this RPP official 
resign his UDT post implying that Secretary General Abdou 
need not resign his UDT post simply because he is a ranking 
member of the opposition ARD. 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. (C) The impact of USG demarches threatening the 
withdrawal of AGOA participation for Djibouti have had little 
effect on their labor policy as Djibouti does not take 
advantage of AGOA benefits.  The USG would have to leverage 
its other interests in Djibouti in order to have any real 
impact on Djibouti\'s abysmal labor record.  More interesting 
than the standard poor worker conditions in Djibouti however 
is the choice of mediators recently employed by President 
Guelleh.  One has to wonder why two members of his immediate 
family, his Director of National Security, and one of his 
personal \"heavies\" would be asked to intervene in an affair 
as mundane as a public transportation strike.  Perhaps 
Guelleh is losing confidence in his cabinet\'s ability to 
direct effective policy or, more likely, he is looking for 
clear lines of credit to interest groups that he can cash in 
when Presidential elections occur in 2005.  A third 
possibility is that with the recent discontent in his armed 
forces (see reftel d) he wanted to silence trouble quickly 
and thus sent in the big guns.  End Comment.

Djibouti. 
 
3. (U) BEGIN TEXT: Djibouti expressed its astonishment 
and its great surprise following the cancellation of 
the visit of German President Johannes Rau for reasons 
of a terrorist threat. 
- 
Djibouti, as an active member country in the

since January 2002, basic sound logistical support and 
a calm environment where possible security worries 
are stemmed by the excellent work of coordination of 
security services.

All of the security measures were in place to 
guarantee and assure, in the best conditions, the 
welcome of the President and his wife. 
- 
According to information at our disposal, we 
can assert, in complete confidence that the threats 
aimed at undermining the life of President Rau cannot 
be taken seriously. 
- 
The reaction of the spokesperson of the Anti- 
Terrorist coalition, present in Djibouti, broadcasted 
from the antennas of RFI (Radio France International) 
expressed the same astonishment and corroborate this 
assertion. 
- 
The Djiboutian president and his German

SUBJECT: ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT POSTPONED: DJIBOUTIAN PRESS 
COVERAGE 
 
 
1. (U) Immediately following the announcement of the 
postponement of the Arab League summit in Tunis, 
\"La Nation,\" the official government newspaper, ran 
three articles of commentary in the Monday, March 29th 
edition. 
 
2. (U) The first article, on the front page of \"La 
Nation,\" carried an immediate account from Tunis on the 
postponement of the Arab League summit.  The article 
stated facts, but had a few comments of disappointment 
sprinkled into the wording of the piece.  The article 
stated that Tunisia decided to postpone the summit due 
to differences of opinions concerning questions of 
democratic reform, protection of Human Rights, promotion 
of women\'s rights and the role of civil society.  The 
article quoted Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Hatem Ben Salem, as saying that the Tunisian propositions 
for Arab reforms were \"an affirmation of the value of 
tolerance, understanding and dialogue between 
civilizations while expressing categorical refusal of 
extremism, fanaticism, violence and terrorism.\"  Salem 
also alluded to the assassination of Sheik Yassin when 
he further expressed his \"profound regret for the 
postponement of the summit from which the Arab world was 
expecting a lot especially in these delicate 
circumstances which the Arab world is going through and 
the deadlock in which the Palestinian cause is in after 
the latest dramatic developments.\"  The article went on 
to comment that Arab reforms and the Arab-Israeli 
conflict set off serious differences and deadlock in the 
preparatory meetings of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs. 
The article stated that some ministers were surprised and 
did not understand the decision, while others thought it 
was imperative to get beyond the differences and reach a 
convergence of opinion on the two main issues; the Arab 
reforms and the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
 
3. (U) The second article ran on page six, of ten, in 
the Arab World section of the paper.  The article stated 
that Tunisia decided to postpone the summit, \"which 
seemed to get off to a bad start.\"  The reason cited 
for the postponement was the serious discord among the 
member countries on two of the main issues during 
preliminary planning meetings.  The preliminary meetings 
held Friday and Saturday were attended by the Ministers 
of Foreign Affairs for the member nations.  The article 
repeated many of the same facts from the front-page 
article, but elaborated that a large cause for the discord 
at the planning meetings stemmed from the \"order of the 
day,\" the topic of relaunching of an Israeli-Palestinian 
peace initiative.  The article quoted Jordanian Minister 
of Foreign Affairs as saying that the Arabs must come to 
an agreement quickly on a date and location for the summit. 
 
4. (U) The third article, also in the Arab World section 
of the paper, repeated many of the same facts as the 
first two but was more of an in-depth look at the reasons 
the countries were unable to come to a consensus.  The 
article included several quotes from Ministers that were 
slanted against Tunisia for postponing the summit, saying 
that they made a unilateral decision.  The article also 
specifically stated that the assassination of Sheik Yassin 
rendered continuation of the peace initiative as 
\"politically risky.\"  The article reported that general 
outcry from Syria and Libya over the mere inclusion of a 
proposed peace initiative and Arab League reforms made 
preparatory meetings \"intense\" and \"turbulent.\"  The two 
countries were reported to comment that these two issues 
were not among Arab priorities.  The chief of the 
political department of the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization (PLO), Farouk Kaddoumi, was reported to be 
in line with the Syrians and Libyans to denounce the plan 
for reforms.  However, another Arab spokesperson was 
quoted as saying \"The position expressed by Mr. Kaddoumi 
does not particularly represent the position of the 
Palestinian Authority, which is not opposed to the 
adoption of a plan for reform, but an acerbic critique 
of a Palestinian spokesperson against Egypt and Jordan 
for their ties with Israel.\"  An anonymous source is 
quoted as saying the representatives of these two 
countries insist on the \"necessity to settle the 
Arab-Israeli conflict in its entirety.\"

SUBJECT: LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR BASE NEGOTIATIONS 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE 
FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (U)  This is an action cable. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (C) Groundwork must be laid to ensure the upcoming round 
of lease negotiations transpire as smoothly as possible.  To 
this end, U.S. Embassy Djibouti proposes to hold a 
coordination meeting between French forces in Djibouti (FFDJ) 
and MARCENT Djibouti (MDJ) to pave the way for future lease 
negotiations.  Additionally, we ask that U.S. Embassy 
Djibouti be allowed to announce lease negotiations to the 
Government of Djibouti via diplomatic note when all parties 
concerned are prepared to proceed. 
 
-------------- 
Good Neighbors 
-------------- 
 
3. (C)  Currently, other than Camp Lemonier, no other 
military facilities exist on the South side of Ambouli 
International Airport.  MDJ wishes to acquire land to the 
East and access to the sea in order to facilitate required 
expansion plans.  The commander of FFDJ, MG Gerard Pons, has 
informally shared on several occasions with the Embassy and 
with Commander of CJTF-HOA an FFDJ desire for future 
construction plans on the south side of the runway.  From 
discussions with both MDJ and FFDJ it appears that both 
parties should be able to accomplish their respective 
expansion projects.  However, to preserve the current 
goodwill and prevent future conflict, both parties should 
conduct a meeting soon to lay out exact requirements and 
space needs of each side.  U.S. Embassy Djibouti is willing 
to host such a meeting during the planned April 25-27 trip to 
Djibouti by the OSD, Joint Staff, and CENTCOM.  Such a 
meeting will clear the air, dispel any suspicions and put the 
USG in a good position prior to the renegotiation of the Base 
Access Agreement for Camp Lemonier. 
 
-------------------------- 
Facilitating Communication 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C)  When the decision is made to move forward with new 
lease negotiations, we propose that the USG inform the 
Djiboutian government via diplomatic note from this Embassy. 
While we hold no illusions that this will ensure all relevant 
parties coordinate and collaborate within the Djiboutian 
government, it will put us on the high ground here in 
Djibouti when confronted by members of the DJG who claim to 
have been \"cut out\" of the process. 
 
5. (C) We have not been notified officially by the Djiboutian 
government who will negotiate for Djibouti in the next round 
of negotiations for Camp Lemonier.  However, it is a safe 
assumption that it will be Ambassador Olhaye in Washington, 
D.C.  It is also no secret among the Djibouti watchers that 
Ambassador Olhaye is not well liked by other senior members 
of the Djiboutian MFA or military.  As has been noted in past 
cables, the current lease for Camp Lemonier caused discontent 
amongst Djiboutian military members when it was discovered 
that their air base (otherwise known as the presidential 
hangar) had been, in their view, \"given away.\"  Notifying the 
DJG via diplomatic note from this Embassy will make clear to 
all concerned that there is no intention on our part to hide 
the process from anyone.

SUBJECT: DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION OF EACTI ENGLISH LANGUAGE 
PROJECT 
 
1. (U)   Post has received a high volume of requests in 
Djibouti for English language training.  Djibouti is a 
Francophone island in a predominantly English speaking Horn 
of Africa region.  The arrival of CJTF-HOA, the only U.S. 
Military base in Africa, has created 
an additional incentive for Djiboutians to learn English as 
they seek employment and contracts with Department of Defense 
contractors providing logistical support to the base. 
 
2. (U)  In response to this demand, Post approached the 
fledgling English language department at Pole University 
Djibouti (PUD), an emerging partner to Post\'s Public Affairs 
Section, to explore possibilities for collaboration.  Staff 
and students alike bemoaned the lack of a language laboratory 
where they could listen to native English speakers and 
practice pronunciation and comprehension.  After identifying 
a potential funding mechanism Post approached PUD Director 
Hiba Ahmed Hiba, accompanied by the English language 
department chief, and presented him with the idea.  Hiba 
responded positively and stated that his staff would prepare 
a proposal outlining their needs for a laboratory.  Post has 
information that the proposal is complete but remains on 
Hiba\'s desk. 
 
3. (U)  Conoff met March 29 with Mohamed Ali Hassan, Director 
of bi-lateral relations at the Djiboutian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, to solicit support in the establishment of an 
English language laboratory and American Corners at PUD.  The 
meeting was a follow-on to Ambassador\'s March 27 meeting with 
Hassan on other matters in which Hassan requested U.S. 
assistance in providing English language training 
opportunities for Djibouti.  Ambassador had explained to 
Hassan the existence of a language laboratory proposal under 
the East Africa Counterterrorism Initiative (EACTI) that had 
been funded but which languished with PUD.  Hassan asked for 
a copy of the letter to PUD offering the project, which 
Conoff subsequently delivered. 
 
4. (U)  Post has been delayed in the implementation of EACTI 
funds for these projects by the inaction of PUD Director 
Hiba.  The initiatives are actively supported by Hiba\'s PUD 
staff and Education Ministry officials.  Hassan asked to be 
courtesy copied on all Public Affairs related correspondence 
with Government of Djibouti institutions and commented that 
he would ask the Minister of Education to investigate the 
delay.  Hassan also said he would like the Embassy to explore 
ways in which the MFA could profit from U.S. assistance to 
create the institutional capacity to provide English language 
formation to its staff.  Ambassador Ragsdale and Conoff will 
meet with PUD Director Hiba April 1 to accentuate Post\'s 
desire to commence implementation of EACTI funds which must 
be obligated this fiscal year. 
 
5. (U) Comment: Post continues to actively pursue Public 
Diplomacy activities in this front line state in the Global 
War on Terrorism.  Post is working to complete the ground 
work for EACTI fund obligation but faces unique challenges. 
The lack of PD activities at Post since the closing of USIS 
some fifteen years ago has left a dirth of partners that must 
be rebuilt from the ground up.  The comparatively massive 
resources available to the French Cultural Center and the 
French Cooperation tacitly discourage engagement with U.S. 
partners.  In addition, significant portions of Post\'s 
limited human resources are consumed with media outreach. End 
Comment.

REF: DJIBOUTI 447 
 
1. (U) Summary: Following the kick-off conference to 
the African Rift Valley Geothermal Development Facility 
(reftel), La Nation, the government run newspaper, ran 
several in-depth articles on the events of the conference 
and geothermal potential for Djibouti in its March 31, 
2004 edition. Post feels this expansive coverage of the 
conference is an indication of the importance the 
Government of Djibouti is putting on this effort.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) The Djiboutian government is making a grand show 
of its newly announced commitment to pursuing geothermal 
energy with four and a half pages of articles, nearly 
half the paper,  in La Nation March 31 on the ARGeo 
conference that took place March 17-20.  PolOff and 
Econ/Comm Assistant attended the full conference and 
noted that the official photographer was present for all 
events and many sessions had Radio Television Djibouti 
(RTD) there as well.  La Nation\'s coverage included a 
summary of the conference and its outcomes, a history of 
the geothermal program in Djibouti, details of the ARGeo 
program, an interview on the potential of geothermal 
energy with Secretary General of the Ministry of Energy, 
Abdi Farah Chideh, and the full text of President 
Guelleh\'s message which was read at the opening of the 
conference.  With such fanfare given to the project, 
one gets the impression the Government of Djibouti has 
taken a \"no-turning-back\" attitude towards the pursuit 
of geothermal energy. 
 
3. (U) Among the most important points highlighted by these 
articles is the change in attitude of those responsible for 
energy and electricity in the government.  Secretary General 
of the Ministry of Energy, Abdi Farah Chideh, was quoted 
as saying \"the workshop marking the launch of the ARGeo 
project was a perfect success.  I do not see why I would 
doubt the success of the project itself.\"  Chideh in earlier 
meetings with PolOff had seemed very hesitant and doubtful 
of the proposals from an American company interested in 
developing the geothermal resources in Djibouti, saying 
that there was not enough research done.  Chideh mentioned 
that the government hoped the ARGeo project would result in 
\"a knowledge of the geothermal energy potential throughout 
Djibouti, ending in studying the possibilities of an 
eventual geothermal plant for the production of electricity, 
that is to say a less expensive energy for the benefit of 
the population.\" 
 
4. (U) The message from President Guelleh was very forward 
leaning noting that \"it should not escape our minds the 
need to adapt our economies to the new world environment 
marked by a technological and scientific revolution 
...Geothermal energy constitutes for our countries and 
our populations an alternative to attain progress and a 
real national independence.\"  Guelleh also commented that 
the theme of the conference was one that carried hope that 
would permit the country to put its strategies for 
sustainable development and the fight against poverty on a 
durable and solid base. 
 
5. (U) Comment: We note that the Honorary Consul for Japan 
in Djibouti, Maitre Farah Mourad, queried Ambassador very 
heavily on the prospects for geothermal development in 
Djibouti.  It is not clear if there is Japanese interest 
in a project.  Japan provides around US$ 10 million in aid 
per year to Djibouti, according to the Honorary Consul.

AND HIV/AIDS IN DJIBOUTI 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C) According to Djibouti\'s Minister of Health, Dr. 
Mohammed Ali Kamil, most recent studies indicate that the 
rate of HIV/AIDS infection in Djibouti is about 3 percent. 
During the Ambassador\'s courtesy call on him, the Minister 
said this rate indicates that Djibouti is in a state of 
\"generalized infection,\" which needs to be controlled before 
it becomes too late.  The small size of the country, he 
added, could make the fight against HIV/AIDS very efficient, 
in actuality, if donor assistance in the campaign against 
HIV/AIDS is made available. 
 
2. (C) Kamil said assistance from donors should focus first 
on regional disease-prevention programs since most of the 
patients with infectious diseases are foreigners from Somalia 
or Ethiopia (75 per cent in the districts and 50 per cent in 
Djibouti city). Indeed, he continued, most of the 4,000 
tuberculosis cases in Djibouti are Ethiopians. They are 
depleting Djiboutian resources, he claimed.  Kamil noted 
World Bank funding of a program aimed at reducing infectious 
diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria generally in 
Djibouti. \"This is the most important area of support 
Djibouti requires,\" he said. 
 
3. (U) The Minister also said UNICEF assists the Ministry of 
Health in the areas of vaccinations, mother-child health 
care, and mother-child HIV/AIDS transmission, with a total 
budget of USD 681,000 for 2004.  The World Health 
Organization contributed USD 500,000 of this amount, he said. 
 
 
4. (U) In this regard, Kamil told Ambassador that Djibouti 
wishes to be eligible for President Bush\'s Global AIDS 
Initiative. He expressed the view that his Ministry and 
Djibouti\'s health sector had completed a number of reforms 
that would support eligibility. It is the only country in the 
region with comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment 
capabilities.  Moreover, Djibouti has designated seven 
centers for HIV/AIDS treatment and has appointed an HIV/AIDS 
Coordination Committee comprised of 11 ministries. 
 
5. (U)  Comment: Current USAID programming in Djibouti 
already includes an additional focus on prevention of 
infectious diseases including tuberculosis, malaria and 
HIV/AIDS.  Its total obligation through a Strategic Objective 
Grant Agreement for Health with the Government of the 
Republic of Djibouti is USD 12 million.  End comment.

SUBJECT: RECENT TELECOM DEVELOPMENTS IN DJIBOUTI 
 
REF: PRETORIA 973 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Djibouti has begun to market itself 
as a potential hub for trade activity.  It is trying 
hard to bring the country up to speed for the 21st 
century with significant reform and development in the 
telecommunications sector.  Already home to a hub for 
the SEA-ME-WE#3 (South East Asia-Middle East-Western 
Europe #3) transoceanic cable, Djibouti is hoping to 
be the site for bigger, better bandwidth as 
a termination point for the new SEA-ME-WE#4.  The two 
cables serve as connectors for Internet and 
telecommunications between Europe and Asia.  The #4 
cable is proposed to have eight times the bandwidth 
of the #3 cable.  The Government of Djibouti sees 
the #4 cable as a crucial piece in the 
telecommunications development puzzle.  Djibouti 
Telecom is currently preparing a bid and searching 
for the necessary funding that the connection to 
SEA-ME-WE#4 will need. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) Telecommunications and Internet availability, 
connectivity and cost are some of the largest obstacles 
to conducting business in Djibouti.  Despite Djibouti\'s 
status as home to a large hub in the SEA-ME-WE #3 
transoceanic cable, the country only has a two-Megabit 
information capacity in its connection to the Internet. 
Djibouti currently has 270 access lines for the Internet 
available to individual customers.  These access lines 
have a maximum of 56Kbps connection speed.  Internet 
connections are extremely slow due to the overload of 
these access lines and cannot support most modern 
Internet technology, limiting the possibilities of 
business activities online.  However, Djibouti Telecom 
also offers the option for businesses to lease an access 
line of their own.  If a business chooses to lease an 
Internet access line, the highest bandwidth available is 
256Kbps.  The cost for leasing an access line is between 
US$ 1200 and US$ 2100 per month.  This cost prohibits most 
businesses from affording an access line of their own. 
 
3. (U) The average cost per month for Internet on a 
non-leased line ranges from US$ 16 to US$ 34 per month, 
depending on the plan chosen.  To put this into 
perspective with the Djiboutian economy, the reported GDP 
per capita is US$ 1,200 annually. (Note: This figure only 
includes those listed as citizens and does not factor in 
the fifty percent unemployment rate, meaning only half the 
population contributes to the GDP. End Note.)  These costs 
are prior to the 8.5 cents per minute rate charged for 
local calls, and the seven percent service tax that is 
charged on all telephone and Internet services.  If a 
Djiboutian spent just one hour per day online, the 
per-minute charges would be an additional US$ 153.  After 
all installation, taxes, monthly fees and per minute 
charges are added up and speed factored in, it is evident 
why most business who use the Internet do so only at 
Internet cafes. 
 
3. (U) Telephone lines and service in Djibouti are 
expensive and is considered a luxury to most Djiboutians. 
The average monthly cost for fixed line service is around 
six U.S. dollars.  The real cost is of course the per- 
minute charge.  The above mentioned price of 8.5 cents 
per-minute is a result of a January 2003 fifty percent 
price cut.  Since the option of GSM mobile phones has been 
introduced, with the ability to have less costly pre-paid 
usage, a number of people have requested cancellation of 
their fixed line, and opting instead to only use mobile 
phones.  Currently, Djibouti Telecom has approximately 
9,500 fixed lines available and 23,000 GSM service 
subscribers.  The actual number of fixed and GSM lines 
available is much lower.  The current overload of the 
telephone system causes connections to be unreliable and 
difficult to obtain, especially when dialing 
internationally.  International rates range from 90 cents 
per minute for Djibouti\'s immediate neighbors to $3.39 
per minute, with calls to the U.S. and most of the French- 
speaking western world falling in the $2.26 per minute 
category. 
 
4. (U) Djibouti Telecom is currently in negotiations to 
expand its bandwidth on SEA-ME-WE#3.  The company 
recently announced an increase to four megabits of 
information capacity.  Within six months, information 
capacity will increase to 45 Megs and ADSL service will 
be provided to individuals who want the increased 
bandwidth.  The Chinese government is funding a project 
to build a fiber-optic ring around Djibouti City to 
enhance the network capability of Djibouti Telecom. 
This project is critical to being able to increase the 
bandwidth and proceed with the overall development plan 
for telecommunications.  Though the project is scheduled 
for a completion date of 2005, it got off to a late start 
and a termination date has not been determined. 
 
5. (U) In the long term, a project spearheaded by South 
African Telecom (reftel) plans the construction of an 
Eastern African Submarine System (EASSy) to connect the 
east coast of Africa to the SEA-ME-WE#3 cable, starting in 
Mtunzini, South Africa and ending in Djibouti.  Djibouti 
Telecom has signed a Memorandum of Understanding and 
other preliminary agreements with the other telecom 
corporations along the East Coast.  Scheduled completion 
of this project is 2006. 
 
6. (U) The SEA-ME-WE#4 transoceanic cable is one of the 
most important development projects for Djibouti.  At a 
bandwidth eight-times greater than the #3 cable, 
SEA-ME-WE#4 is the project that would greatly impact the 
speed and quality of telecommunications over the next 
ten to twenty years.  After an unsuccessful negotiation 
last year, Djibouti is in the process of once again 
putting together a bid to the international consortium 
which is constructing SEA-ME-WE#4.  In order to bid on a 
connection, Djibouti will approach the banking community 
in order to appropriate around $30 million dollars in 
funding that access to the #4 cable will require.

E.O. 12958:  N/A 
TAGS: ASIG, AMGT, DJ 
SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR\'S POST MEMORANDUM - DJIBOUTI 
 
Post Memorandum 
United States Embassy Djibouti 
 
Djibouti is a close ally of the United States and a key 
partner in the global struggle against terrorism.  It hosts 
the only U.S. military base in sub-Saharan Africa, is 
headquarters for the Combined Joint Task Force- Horn of 
Africa, which directs coalition counter-terrorism operations 
in East Africa and Yemen, and is working diligently to 
stabilize the Horn of Africa, including to lessen tensions 
between Eritrea and Ethiopia and to achieve peace and 
stability in Somalia. 
 
-Embassy Goals and Objectives 
 
As reported in the Embassy\'s FY 2006 Mission Program Plan, 
the goals of Embassy Djibouti are to increase the 
effectiveness of Djibouti\'s partnership with the United 
States in the global war on terrorism, to promote regional 
stability through cooperation with Djibouti, to enhance the 
Embassy\'s support to U.S. citizens, to broaden public 
diplomacy strategies of the United States, and to improve 
management and organizational performance of the mission.  A 
number of performance indicators have been established to 
measure performance and to track progress in each of these 
areas. Post is above target in its strategic goals on 
counter-terrorism and regional stability, with the signing 
of a long-term agreement for the U.S. base at Camp Lemonier 
and full implementation of local training activities through 
the East Africa Counter-terrorism initiative.  More work is 
needed, however, in the areas of support to U.S. citizens, 
development of a full public diplomacy and public affairs 
program, and in the promotion of Management and 
Organizational excellence. 
 
-Operational Problems 
 
There are a number of operational and administrative support 
problems that inhibit Embassy Djibouti\'s achievement of its 
objectives.  As a SEP post and hardship differential post, 
with a difficult climate and location in a region of Africa 
that has previously been the target of terrorism, Embassy 
Djibouti has consistently failed to attract experienced 
officers for any of its key officer positions.  As of 
February 22, 2004, the date of arrival at post of this 
Ambassador, the Embassy\'s sole Consular, Public Diplomacy, 
Political/Economic, and General Services Officer positions 
were all filled by first-tour Junior Officers.   In 
addition, a first-tour Management Officer departed post the 
day of Ambassador\'s arrival after only a brief tenure.  That 
position is now being encumbered by an experienced WAE.  He 
departs June 30, but is not expected to be followed by a 
permanently assigned Management Officer in the interim. 
This will mean a continuation of interim staffing for the 
management section.  The steps to overcome these shortfalls 
include vigorous recruitment of more senior staff, but is 
unlikely to achieve the results post requires, given 
staffing realities in the Department in the near- term. 
 
-Performance of Operating Sections 
 
As this Ambassador only arrived at post one month ago, she 
is still in the process of conducting evaluations of the 
operating sections of the mission.  Initial impressions, 
however, are of a mission of American and Locally Engaged 
Staff who work earnestly and hard, and with tremendous 
dedication despite limited resources, to keep the mission 
afloat and to achieve U.S. objectives.  Performance by all 
sections has been admirable despite the absence of an 
Ambassador for eight of the past nine months and the absence 
of an experienced Management Officer for the same period. 
We want to protect U.S. citizens through stringent 
application of visa and refugee processing regulations, but 
are hampered, and will continue to be hampered in this area, 
by concerns about Consular staffing.  By August, 2004, the 
Consular Section will have lost -either by assignment or 
immigration - its entire staff consisting of one American 
officer, one American contract employee and on FSN 
assistant. With that loss, goes loss of experience.  We fear 
most the presence of weaknesses in the consular part of our 
operations that might inadvertently permit malafides to 
enter the United States, either as refugees or as holders of 
immigrant and non-immigrant visas. 
 
-Other Agency Support 
 
Other agency support for the mission seems superb, to the 
extent that Ambassador is able to judge in her brief tenure 
thus far.  The U.S. Agency for International Development 
(USAID) has been on the ground only since July of 2003.  It 
is in the process of managing a development assistance 
program of more than $30 million in the areas of education, 
health, and food security, while also recruiting staff and 
re-defining office space to meet its operational needs.  The 
current USAID Director arrived in February 2004.   The 
Security Assistance Officer, under Central Command (CENTCOM) 
and Department of Defense (DOD) auspices, is working closely 
with the Ambassador and has excellent ties with Djibouti\'s 
military.  In addition, a Naval Criminal Investigative 
Service (NCIS) officer has been thoroughly integrated into 
Embassy operations, including serving as back-up to our 
Regional Security Officer.  The NCIS officer is also the 
Embassy\'s vital liaison with Camp Lemonier and the Combined 
Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa stationed in Djibouti.

1. (U) PolOff, Econ/Comm Assistant and OBO 
representative met April 4 with Mohammed M. Ali Yamani, 
Managing Director of Maya Trading Company in Jeddah and 
Fahmi Ahmed Al-Hag, President Guelleh\'s Advisor on 
Investment.  Yamani recently signed a contract with the 
Government of Djibouti, including full land ownership 
rights, to develop the Haramous region of Djibouti city. 
(See Reftel)  Embassy met with Yamani to discuss the 
impact the Haramous Village development would have on 
possible sites for a New Embassy Compound.  All three 
possible sites are located within the Haramous Village 
area. 
 
2. (U) Al-Hag led off discussions reminding Embassy 
representatives that the U.S. had not made any formal 
requests for sites to the government and a decision 
would have to be made quickly due to the high demand 
for land in the last residential zoned sector of the 
city.  Al-Hag explained that the amount of land 
designated for the Haramous Village project is 840,000 
square meters, which was increased from the initial 
number cited in reftel.  Al-Hag also explained that 
though this region has been undeveloped up to this 
point, there are twenty landowners in the Haramous 
area that would be re-imbursed for the relinquishment 
of their holdings. 
 
3. (U) Yamani\'s attitude was very cordial and eager, 
commenting that the Embassy would be a client and any 
special considerations would be accommodated.  Yamani 
showed Embassy representatives a detailed plan of 
Haramous Village and discussed the time frame and 
process of construction.  Haramous Village is intended 
to be a new high-end residential area, with an average 
villa cost of $250,000-350,000.  The village will have 
260 total new villas, as well as a housing complex with 
apartments to rent.  These apartments will be available 
to rent for short periods of time for businessmen 
traveling through Djibouti for longer amounts of time. 
Haramous Village will have Mosques, reception halls, a 
recreation center, police and fire stations, a clinic, 
commercial center and a luxury hotel on the water. 
The project will have all the most modern technological 
infrastructure and will be equipped with piping for 
eventual sewage disposal systems that would accompany a 
waste water treatment plant if Djibouti were to convert 
from its current septic tank system.  Yamani emphasized 
that the project was at an early stage and all requests 
could be accommodated and plans adapted before 
construction began.  Yamani indicated a willingness to 
work with whichever site the U.S. picked for a new 
Embassy. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT: Post information reveals that Yamani 
has influential ties with the President\'s brother, 
Said Omar Guelleh.  Post has also heard rumors 
that bribes may have been passed to expedite the 
acquisition and processing of permits for the Haramous 
development project.  Post does not have credible 
evidence of these bribes, or that any money exchanged 
went beyond the standard favors that grease the wheels 
of business in Djibouti.  However, Post\'s impression 
of Yamani was that of a very honest, genial, and 
professional businessman willing to do the job right 
the first time and adapt to meet the needs of a 
potential client.  Any information Embassy Riyadh or 
Consulate Jeddah can shed on Yamani would be greatly 
appreciated.  End Comment.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Ambassador met April 7 at the Russian Embassy with 
Russia\'s Ambassador to Djibouti Alexandre Bregadze to note 
Deputy Minister Trubnikov\'s meeting with Deputy Secretary 
Armitage and to discuss the advancement of U.S.-Russian 
common interests in prosecuting the global war on terrorism. 
(see reftel)  Ambassador told Bregadze that the U.S. believes 
there is a need to work more closely with Russia in 
counterterrorism.  She noted that while Cold War images over 
the past decade have hindered bilateral cooperation between 
the U.S. and Russia on counterterrorism, we are now in a new 
era where the implications of terrorism for both nations are 
real. 
 
2. (S) Bregadze responded that he had also received 
communication from his government to develop more broader 
cooperation with the U.S.  He had been fully briefed on 
Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s meeting with Minister Trubnikov. 
Bregadze added that his mission had made an effort in this 
area with the American Embassy in the past, but had detected 
what he described as \"a measure of reluctance\" to engage. 
Ambassador responded that some of the concerns Bregadze 
expressed may relate to the previous state of relations 
between Russia and the United States or of language facility. 
The new era, however, now requires change.  She pledged the 
full cooperation of the Embassy and hoped that he would also 
reciprocate with his mission staff.  Ambassador conveyed to 
Bregadze, the name of Embassy\'s Regional Affairs Officer 
(RAO), who would be in a position to discuss with his Russian 
counterpart more technical aspects of our counterterrorism 
efforts. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador also stated that the Embassy has worked 
with Djibouti as part of the  Anti-Terrorism Assistance 
initiative of the U.S. to implement training of Djiboutian 
police and other law enforcement personnel in explosive 
incident countermeasures, post-blast investigations, VIP 
protection, hostage-taking negotiations and several other 
courses aimed at deterring and/or disrupting terrorist acts. 
She told Bregadze that Embassy\'s Regional Security Officer, 
with responsibility for Mission Security, would be able to 
brief his Russian counterpart on this training program. 
 
4. (S) Bregadze agreed and seemed pleased by the U.S. desire 
to cooperate. He stated, however, that he had a very small 
staff in Djibouti and none dedicated to counterterrorism. 
Yet there is an officer based at the Russian Embassy in Addis 
Ababa, he said, who has this portfolio and also services 
Djibouti.  Bregadze said he would ask this officer to get in 
touch with Embassy Djibouti\'s RAO. 
 
5. (C) Comment:  The Russian Ambassador is personable and an 
informed interlocutor, reads avidly, and selectively, has 
shared specific items with Ambassador, and appears to have a 
good grasp of U.S. strategic and economic interests in Africa 
and the Middle East.  He sees radical Islam, at the root of 
much of Middle East terrorism, as an ideology of poverty that 
has replaced ideologies such as Communism.  He sees no repeat 
no base for radical Islam in Djibouti. On Somalia, Bregadze 
expressed the belief that a federation of loosely associated 
states in Somalia proper might be the best route to peace 
there because of the intractable nature of tribal conflict. 
He also has expressed his conviction that no solution to the 
problem in Somalia is possible absent cooperation and input 
of Ethiopia. 
 
6. (C) Comment continued:  In response to Ambassador\'s 
comment on the difficulties of attracting staff to hardship 
posts in Africa, Bregadze stated that Russia\'s Foreign 
Ministry has a similar difficulty.  He said the problem is 
greater than the preferences of his country\'s diplomats. 
It\'s a matter of lack of bodies as experienced diplomats 
leave the Foreign Service for more attractive opportunities 
abroad or in the private sector. 
 
7. (C) Comment continued: Ambassador Bregadze served at 
Russia\'s mission in Paris as Cultural Attache and attended 
France\'s L\'Ecole Nationale de Science Politique.  End comment.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) During Ambassador\'s March 30 courtesy call on 
Minister of Agriculture Dini Abdallah Bililis, Bililis 
expressed gratitude for USAID funding of a livestock 
marketing/health certification facility and food security 
programs.  He also expressed appreciation for the assistance 
of Camp Lemonier and the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of 
Africa, especially in the area of water resource development. 
 On the latter, he stressed the importance of program 
coordination with his Ministry to balance projects among 
donors. 
 
2. (C) The Minister stated that although Djibouti is arid, 
agriculture could be developed with abundant water. 
Desalinization of may be the best source, and Lac Assal might 
benefit most, he added. According to the Minister, studies to 
determine Djibouti\'s agricultural potential are being 
undertaken with the help of the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), but with a very small funding amount of 
USD 10,000.  More funding to study Djibouti\'s potential for 
agricultural development is needed, the Minister stated. 
 
3. (C) Current Djiboutian \"farming\", the Minister continued, 
consists of small \"orchards\" in different areas of the 
country, such as in Assamo, As-Eyla, Bankoualeh and Randa, 
where vegetables and fruits are currently grown.  He said he 
realizes that overall development of agriculture in Djibouti 
is a real challenge, but that his government plans to move in 
\"step by step\" fashion toward that end, beginning with 
reinforcement of existing farming capabilities.  According to 
Bililis, a plan is afoot for a donor round table with 
Djibouti, Morocco, the Islamic Development Bank and FAO to 
secure necessary financing of a meaningful agricultural 
development program. 
 
4. (C) Bililis also confirmed Djibouti\'s keenness to develop 
its fisheries industry with help from the African Development 
Bank.  There is the need to protect that industry. 
Djibouti\'s Fisheries Code, he continued, aims more at 
guarding Djibouti\'s waters from foreign fishing vessels 
primarily from Yemen and Egypt than at facilitating a 
fisheries industry.  However, the South African Development 
Bank is planning to develop a shrimp farm in Godoria, he 
said. The Minister expressed disappointment in an Iranian 
investor who had promised to equip the existing port of 
Djibouti with modern fishing laboratories, but who ultimately 
failed to perform. 
 
5. (C) Comment: The human resource and financial costs of 
agricultural development in the absence of a large market, 
and the lack of skills in sustained agricultural production, 
are the greatest handicaps to full agricultural development 
in Djibouti despite Bililis\'s optimism. End comment.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Minister of Commerce and Industry, Saleban Omar 
Oudine, sees the planned port of Doraleh as key to a 
prosperous economic future for Djibouti.  In a March 31 
meeting with Ambassador, he talked about the port and its two 
key components: a fuel container terminal and a Free Zone. 
The container terminal will require relocation of operations 
of oil companies currently in Djibouti, including America\'s 
Exxon-Mobil, and the construction of new fuel reservoirs. 
Oudine accused oil companies of having caused a great deal of 
environmental harm to the existing main port, which he said 
will need to be cleaned after repositioning at Doraleh. 
 
2. (C) The Free Zone for commerce and industry envisioned for 
the port could serve land-locked Common Market for Eastern 
and Southern Market (COMESA) countries, according to Oudine. 
Uganda wants to lease space at the Free Zone in order to 
stock both imported and exported goods. As Djibouti is a 
member of both COMESA and the Africa Caribbean Pacific Group 
(ACP), Uganda could take advantage of Djibouti\'s ACP 
membership to export products to ACP countries, he said. 
Oudine also stated that Egypt is anxious to obtain private 
space at the Free Zone for use as a produce export point to 
reach the huge Ethiopian market. 
 
3. (C) Oudine continued that China has expressed interest in 
establishing a car-manufacturing facility in this Free Zone. 
China is becoming \"more aggressive\" in Africa broadly, with 
200 Chinese companies having organized a trade show in 
Ethiopia in 2003, he stated.  In his view, the Chinese are 
targeting low-income African countries which are more 
interested in low-cost goods than expensive high-quality 
products. 
 
4. (C)  Oudine expects that Turkish and Indian businesses 
will also have interest in the free zone.  He added that 
Jebel Ali in Dubai wants to decentralize its saturated market 
and some of its companies will need to be relocated to 
Djibouti in order to serve African buyers. 
 
5. (C) Djibouti\'s aim, Oudine said, is to create an 
environment conducive to development of services because it 
has no natural resources upon which to rely.  It does not 
want to be dependent on Ethiopia for revenues, for two 
reasons.  First, Ethiopia does not share Djibouti\'s values 
and second, a history of thirty years of socialism has made 
its countrymen difficult to work with.  Djibouti wants to 
develop commercial ties with other countries, Oudine 
continued, in order to be truly independent.  To support that 
effort, and boost the activities of the port, he said 
Djibouti is drafting a commercial code which will stress 
Djibouti\'s liberal economic policies and its desire not to 
impose barriers to trade. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  Despite Oudine\'s optimism, the Port of 
Doraleh remains an ambitious government-led project for 
Djibouti.  Assuming the financing hurdle is overcome, of 
great concern for Embassy in the short-term will be the 
impact of the proposed port container facility on operations 
of existing companies in Djibouti supplying fuel oil for 
domestic use, including Exxon-Mobil. We are looking at the 
implications of this issue, in direct consultation with 
Exxon-Mobil. Of great concern in the long-term will be the 
overall economic viability of the project, especially its 
Free Zone component, taking into account current and future 
economic trends. End comment.

1. (C) At her request, Ambassador met April 11 at the 
Presidency with President Ismail Omar Guelleh to present 
the USG\'s formal offer to purchase land for a new 
Embassy compound site in the Salines Est section of 
Djibouti.  The Ambassador was accompanied by Pol/Econ 
and GSO officers. (Notetakers)  The Ambassador stated 
that the U.S. had identified a site of approximately 
40,300 square meters and would like to begin construction 
as early as 2007.  The U.S.\'s offering price is USD 
1,800,000 to include provision for land fill, installation 
and delivery of utilities to the property, as well as all 
incidental rights and easements associated with the 
property.  She also gave the President a site drawing of 
the property in which the U.S. was interested and a 
non-paper in both English and French of specific points 
covering details of the offer, offer deadline, and U.S. 
rights under the Vienna Convention regarding dues, taxes, 
and fees directly related to purchase of property for a 
diplomatic mission.  (Note: Embassy passed the same 
details via diplomatic note to Djibouti\'s Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs on April 12.  See septel.) 
 
2. (C) Guelleh commented that he had heard rumors 
\"about town\" that the United States was seeking a 
suitable site and that it had hired a private firm to 
survey sites and do measurements, and that the findings 
had been compiled in a \"thick book.\" (Note: Guelleh was 
referring to the NEC Site Selection Report of August 
2003 prepared by DTZ Leadenhall of South Africa.  OBO 
commissioned the report and contracted local architect 
Daniel Dubois to do the survey.  End Note.) 
 
3. (C) Guelleh continued that the Government of Djibouti 
had contracted an investor to develop the site containing 
the tract the U.S. wishes to purchase.  (Note: The 
developer is Maya Trading and Real Estate Development 
Company.  See Reftels A and B. End Note.)  The developer 
would determine the price of the parcels, he said, after 
the Government of Djibouti does its own assessment, 
including the cost of utilities.  Guelleh added that his 
Government had not received from the U.S. any official 
request for land at the time the contract with the 
developer was signed.  Ambassador asked that Guelleh 
consider her meeting today with him, and the formal 
diplomatic note to follow repeating the request, as the 
U.S. government\'s formal offer to purchase.  Guelleh 
responded that he would be in agreement with allowing the 
U.S. to have the parcel of land it is requesting if it 
has not been granted to anyone else. 
 
4. (C) Guelleh then turned to the price of the parcel. 
He told the Ambassador he thought it was \"arbitrary.\" 
Per existing agreements regarding specifications and 
cost of government owned land, he continued, there were 
already buyers that had received land grants from the 
government.  The U.S. may now have to negotiate with 
these beneficiaries.  Ambassador interjected that the 
U.S. understood that a portion (approximately 7,142 
square meters) of the parcel in question had indeed 
been sold, but that the U.S.\'s interest was in the 
remaining 40,300 square meters of the parcel. 
 
5. (C) Guelleh commented that the Government generally 
takes 1000 Djiboutian Francs (approximately USD 6) per 
square meter in a land sale.  Beyond that, the cost of 
utilities and other land preparatory expenses, would be 
added.  He said that the U.S. offer equals roughly 5,000 
Djiboutian Francs per square meter (approximately 
USD 28), but at least 7,000 Djiboutian Francs per square 
meter (approximately USD 39) would be needed to cover 
roadways, networks and drainage.  Ultimately, he said, 
the developer would need to determine the final costs. 
He stated that his Government would review the offer and 
get back to the Ambassador with an assessment.

1. (C) In a meeting with President Guelleh April 11 
on an administrative matter, Ambassador mentioned that 
in January 2004, President Bush declared Djibouti 
eligible under the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
(AGOA), but concerns about the treatment of labor 
unions could still endanger that status.  She 
respectfully asked for President Guelleh\'s intervention 
in this matter, noting that it had already been raised 
with Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Badri Ali Bogoreh.  Ambassador passed a copy 
of talking points from Reftel A (in English) to 
President Guelleh. 
 
2. (C) Guelleh responded that the right to have labor 
unions was based on constitutional law.  He emphasized 
that the Government of Djibouti is willing and obliged 
to invest in the rights of workers to form unions. 
This commitment is based on a French colonial decree 
in 1952, which requires the government to intervene in 
all aspects of labor practices.  Between 1995 and 1997, 
attempts to reform the labor code were made on the 
recommendation of the World Bank.  Prior to the changes 
in the labor code, the Ministry of Labor intervened on 
issues of hiring, working conditions, dismissal and 
minimum wage.  The World Bank recommendations 
pushed for Djibouti to allow free market conditions to 
regulate the minimum wage and labor force. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador repeated that respect for labor 
practices are a very important condition for AGOA. 
Guelleh responded that the problem with the labor 
unions does not lie with the government but within 
the trade unions themselves. The 1952 law should be 
abolished as well as the minimum wage and the Service 
de Main d\'Ouevre (government labor service).  The 
Government of Djibouti should not have an official 
workforce to supply labor demand but the market should 
determine the allocation.  He commented that the labor 
unions have held elections, but each time the union 
organizes, it splits.  The labor unions also have money 
problems, of which the International Labor Organization 
and International Labor Organization of Africans are 
aware.  Guelleh commented that for the leaders of the 
trade unions, it becomes a way to profit personally and 
once elected the leaders do not want to give up their 
positions because of the benefits they receive. 
 
4. (C) Guelleh emphasized that the labor unions are 
supposed to defend the rights of the worker and nothing 
else.  He commented that the Government of Djibouti\'s 
role is to \"protect the workers from abuse and we assume 
it.\"  He continued to say that the government does not 
want to intervene in inter-trade union issues and should 
focus on protecting workers\' rights according to labor 
laws and the Law of Association, written in 1901.  The 
Government of Djibouti, he said, sees a conflict of 
interest when a person is Secretary General of the Labor 
Union and holds a key position in a political party. 
The goal of the government is to address issues of social 
protection, work accidents, and appeals to the labor court. 
Guelleh remarked that the Republic of Djibouti understands 
its role and has compensated parties for its infractions 
of labor regulations. 
 
5. (C) Comment: The issue of labor rights remains a 
delicate one for the Government, and an economic one. 
Embassy hopes that continued sensitization at the 
highest levels of the Djiboutian Government will bring 
about meaningful change.  End Comment.

Note Number 041 
The Embassy of the United States of America presents its 
compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Republic of Djibouti and has the honor to request the 
Ministry\'s approval to purchase that piece of land located 
in Salines Est, containing a total area of approximately 
40,321 square meters (forty thousand three hundred and 
twenty one square meters), and all rights of easements and 
appurtenances belonging to the said land to be developed 
as the Embassy Compound of the United States of America in 
Djibouti and notionally identified in attached Exhibit A. 
Exhibit A is for identification purposes only and will be 
permanently defined by a formal boundary survey to be 
conducted prior to settlement. 
 
The United States of America hereby submits an offer to 
purchase the property for a price of U.S. Dollars 
1,800,000 (one million, eight hundred thousand dollars). 
This offer is subject to our ability to satisfy normal due 
diligence conditions as well as final U.S. Government and 
Congressional approvals.  If this price is acceptable, we 
are prepared to immediately commence finalization of the 
appropriate purchase agreement documents necessary for the 
transaction.  The purchase price includes the requirement 
for filling of the land, compacting the fill and 
installation and delivery of utilities to the property. 
 
In light of the provisions of the Vienna Conventions on 
Diplomatic and Consular Relations concerning the payment 
of taxes by diplomatic and consular missions, the Embassy 
further requests the Republic of Djibouti, also in the 
spirit of reciprocity, to exempt it from the payment of 
all dues, taxes and fees directly assessed against a 
foreign government in connection with the purchase of 
property for its diplomatic mission, such fees to include 
exemption from recordation and/or transfer taxes which the 
United States would otherwise be obligated to pay as well 
as any and all other charges which do not constitute fees 
for specific services.  It is requested that an 
acknowledgment and approval of this request be written and 
delivered to the Embassy on or before April 25, 2004. 
 
The Embassy of the United States of America avails itself

SUBJECT: UNUSUALLY HEAVY RAINS CAUSE SEVERE FLOODING IN 
DJIBOUTI 
 
 
1. (U)  Summary:  Heavy rains and flooding earlier 
this week have resulted in loss of life and severe 
damage to Djibouti\'s infrastructure. This damage 
will present longer term dangers to the economic 
and social health of the country, including 
possible outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and malaria. 
Djiboutian officials have confirmed 46 dead and 
believe thousands to be homeless.  There are no 
reports of U.S. citizen casualties.  Minister of 
Interior Abdoulkader Wais has requested assistance 
from the U.S.  Post is working with the Government 
of Djibouti, other major donors (particularly the 
French), the U.S. military, International 
Organizations and NGOs to coordinate our response. 
An official request for disaster assistance will 
follow septel.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Heavy rains on April 13 caused severe flooding 
in Djibouti City. Flash floods, caused by dikes 
breaking in the Ambouli Wadi (river bed that is dry 
most of the year), have caused extensive damage in 
several neighborhoods of the city, destroying many 
structures and damaging the contents of homes and 
businesses.  The main route through Djibouti to the 
outer sections of Djibouti City was cut off by 
flooding rapids at 5:00 PM, April 13.  As of 11:00 am, 
April 14, 46 bodies had been recovered, only half of 
which have been identified. The death toll will 
continue to rise as more bodies are found. Estimates 
on the street are in the range of 150 people dead. 
The Government of Djibouti has made general and 
specific requests for assistance to the U.S. 
government and the French military, as it lacks 
adequate technical, material and financial resources 
to fully recover from the floods. 
 
3. (U) The highest priority for the government is to 
evacuate the floodwaters from homes and streets as 
quickly as possible.  This is in effort to prevent 
epidemics of Cholera and Typhoid similar to the 
aftermath of the 1994 and 1999 floods.  Since the 
ground has been saturated by watershed from heavy 
rains in Ethiopia and Somalia, the evaporation of 
the waters could take weeks.  The stagnating water 
will also expand the potential for Cholera, Typhoid 
and Malaria outbreaks.  Priority needs for the 
government are provisions and immediate shelter, 
medicine and vaccinations, water pumps, tents, and 
blankets.  Relief efforts are being coordinated by 
the Office of Civil Protection. 
 
4. (U) Roads into Djibouti from Ethiopia have several 
points where nothing larger than an SUV can pass, 
making transportation of commodities by truck virtually 
impossible.  The Djibouti-Ethiopian Railroad also has 
three major washout points that will take several weeks 
to repair.  This will affect both the commerce in 
Djibouti and Ethiopia, as a large portion of the 
imported goods come from Ethiopia and almost all food 
aid to Ethiopia goes through Djibouti. 
 
5. (U) The government estimates that 90 percent of the 
city\'s population has been affected and at least 
100,000 persons have been displaced.  Already there 
are 600 displaced persons housed in a school in the 
Balbala section, one of the higher points of the city. 
There are three schools that are severely flooded 
within the city and the Ministry of Education has 
suspended classes until Saturday. 
 
6. (U) U.S. Embassy local employees have also been 
affected severely, as most live in the two 
neighborhoods hit hardest by the flooding.  The extent 
of the local employee needs is not yet known, however, 
no loss of life among the Embassy community has been 
reported.

SUBJECT: ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL COUNTER TERRORISM 
FORCE IN DJIBOUTI 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE FOR REASON 
1.4 (A), (B) AND (D) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (S/NF)  Pursuant to the goals of the East Africa 
Counter-Terrorism Initiative (EACTI), U.S. Embassy Djibouti 
wishes to use its security assistance (SA) program to 
establish a national counter terrorism (CT) force within the 
Djiboutian military.  Because of multiple actors within the 
Djibouti security services, the U.S. Embassy will need to 
engage the Djiboutian Government (DJG) to designate this unit 
of focus and set a clear chain of command. 
 
----------------- 
Current Situation 
----------------- 
 
2. (S/NF)  Building host nation capacity in the area of 
counter terrorism is an extremely important component of the 
EACTI.  Djibouti currently is lacking a single national asset 
that can adequately respond to and mitigate regional 
terrorist threats.  The clear intention of the USG is to 
fight regional terrorist threats and to build regional 
stability through the programs of the EACTI. 
Programmatically, the EACTI assigns the function of CT 
capacity building in Djibouti to the Terrorist Interdiction 
Program (TIP) and the Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program 
(ATA).  These programs were funded at $500K and $2.3M 
respectively.  TIP and ATA are focused on customs and 
policing functions.  While important and vital to the overall 
CT effort, TIP and ATA do not allow for the crucial 
integration of the various governmental security elements 
that perform CT roles in the Republic of Djibouti. 
 
3. (S/NF)  Past discussions with several security 
organizations in Djibouti have indicated a desire on their 
part to participate in counter-terrorism training.  This is, 
in part, because of the current national architecture of 
security operations in Djibouti.  That architecture gives 
several different organizations responsibility for the 
various national assets within the country.  The Djiboutian 
Gendarmerie, for example, has responsibility for the 
International Airport and the maritime port perimeter.  The 
Djiboutian Army has responsibility for borders.  The Coast 
Guard has responsibility for approaches to the port.  The 
Republican Guard has responsibility for the Presidency and 
the Presidential residence.  Finally, the National Police 
have responsibility for security of the port\'s interior and 
Djibouti\'s cities and towns.  Yet, past informal attempts to 
get the Djiboutian security forces to consolidate their 
counter-terrorism mission into a single force were stiffly 
rebuffed.  Instead the DJG wishes to create such a 
counter-terrorism task force comprising all the elements 
listed above. 
 
4. (S/NF)  The creation of a task force would help mitigate 
the current scattered counter terrorism responsibilities of 
existing organizations.  That said, there remain many 
problems related to the effective accomplishment of any 
action executed by a force with multiple chains of command 
and organizational lines.  For a task force concept to be 
successful, a clear chain of command and control must be 
established at the outset.  The counter terrorism task force 
chain of command need not be a permanent realignment of 
forces.  It need only be an operational chain of command that 
takes effect in the event the Djiboutian National Command 
Authority assigns a mission to the counter terrorism task 
force.  The day-to-day functions of operations and training 
can remain the responsibilities of each security service. 
 
5. (S/NF)  Additionally, there are internal political 
dynamics within the DJG that must be considered.  A delicate 
balance of power exists currently between the various 
security services within the DJG.  Each service tends to act 
as its own lobby with the President and in some cases each 
has traditional family and clan ties that remain very 
important.  Giving each service a piece of the counter 
terrorism pie would serve to preserve this delicate balance. 
 
--------------- 
The Way Forward 
--------------- 
 
6. (S/NF)  U.S. Embassy proposes to formally approach the DJG 
and request establishment of a CT Task Force with a declared 
chain of command for the employment of it.  Once 
accomplished, a training case will be funded using Foreign 
Military Financing (FMF) money provided as part of the EACTI. 
 This training case will fund the necessary training modules 
to make the Djiboutian CG Task Force an effective force.

1. (U) As outlined in REFTEL (a), the Nation of Djibouti has 
suffered severe damage to it\'s infrastructure as a result of 
flooding in certain parts of the city.  Currently, there have 
been no official reports of instability or an increase in 
crime due to the flooding.  Clearly, the potential exists, 
but it is strictly speculation at this point. 
 
2. (SBU) Physical security at the Embassy remains intact with 
minimal adjustments.  Only a slight interruption in security 
operations occurred due to some Local Guard Force personnel 
being affected directly or indirectly by the flood.  RSO 
managed the manpower constraints effectively without placing 
personnel or property at risk. 
 
3. (C/NF) There was no damage to the technical security 
measures of the Embassy, but the security equipment UPS 
remains inoperative.  Due to the flooding there has been an 
increase in power spikes throughout the city causing outages 
all over to include the Embassy.  Without an operating UPS, 
the security cameras and a portion of the Entry verifications 
systems are affected every time there is a spike.  Post is 
well aware of ESO Addis\' request for replacement parts, but 
would like to request that the parts be expedited as quickly 
as possible. 
 
4. (SBU) Post would like to take this opportunity to kindly 
remind the Department that the need for an ARSO is greater 
now than ever before.  Post RSO is already stretched too thin 
and now that he has to deal with a natural disaster and 
minimal staffing, the demands on the security office are 
overwhelming.  Post requests that the Department strongly 
consider assigning an ARSO to Post as soon as possible.

WOMEN\'S AWARENESS IN DJIBOUTI 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) Minister of Women\'s Affairs Hawa Ahmed Youssef 
credits her awareness programs, first and foremost, with 
enlarging the voting lists of women in Djibouti.  She told 
Ambassador that women are, unfortunately, still reluctant to 
become candidates for Parliament or for regional positions, 
despite her campaigns to broaden political participation. 
Conscious of the reluctance, though, she fought hard and won, 
in her words, to have a law passed in Djibouti that would set 
aside ten percent of all parliamentary seats and regional 
offices for women.  She says there was fierce opposition from 
male parliamentarians, and it could not have happened without 
the support of President Guelleh.  Now, there are seven women 
in Parliament. 
 
2. (C) Asked by Ambassador to characterize the principal 
difficulty the Minister faces in managing the goals of her 
ministry, Hawa Youssef stated that it is the high illiteracy 
rate for Djibouti\'s women -- approximately 73 percent. This 
rate hinders written communication on issues especially when 
three local languages are required (Afar, Somali and Arabic) 
to inform women adequately on issues of concern to them.  In 
some cases, pictures, rather than words, are used to carry 
messages, and this takes careful design and planning.  She 
showed Ambassador a sample of her efforts in this area.  In 
addition, skits are often employed and public appearances by 
the Minister with oral dialogue on various topics. She 
recently led a seminar, which traveled to several Djiboutian 
cities, on the rights of women and the importance of good 
governance.  These techniques were also used to good effect, 
she said, during the launch of a campaign on HIV/AIDS 
awareness, anti-poverty strategies and legal rights of women 
in domestic situations. 
 
3. (C) The Ministry of Women\'s Affairs widely publicized to 
women the new Family Code, passed this year, a copy of which 
she provided the Ambassador.  (Note:  The code is Shari\'a 
based.)  In addition, the Ministry gives legal counseling to 
battered women and to women seeking divorce, although Youssef 
admitted that many withdraw their petitions when confronted 
with the fear of losing income previously provided by their 
husbands.  The  Ministry of Women\'s Affairs also monitors 
mosques and Islamic centers in Djibouti for what Ahmed 
described as \"anti-women propaganda\" in order to circumscribe 
these teachings.  She stressed to Ambassador that Djiboutian 
women are not influenced at all by women of Saudi Arabia and 
the Gulf countries.  Islamic traditions have never been as 
strict, she said, as in Arab countries, but this does not 
prevent Djibouti\'s women from being good Muslims. 
 
4. (C)  Hawa Youssef sees use of the stimulant \"khat\" as a 
problem for both men and women in Djiboutian society.  Its 
eradication is complicated by cultural habit, on the one 
hand, and by the need on the other for women to find sources 
of income for their families\' needs.  Khat selling may be the 
only form for some, especially widows. The challenge, she 
said, will be to find alternative sources of income for these 
women.  The smoking of \"shisha\" pipes is also a greater 
problem currently among young women, the Minister said, and 
suggested that sports, economic support of sports, and 
programs for women might provide a diversion for these habits. 
 
5. (C) Comment: Focused and sharp, Hawa Ahmed Youssef may be 
a good candidate for the International Visitors Program and 
Embassy will consider.  She was born in 1961, has fair 
command of English, and holds a Master\'s Degree in Law from 
France.  She was appointed in 1998 as Director of Women\'s 
Promotion, an office attached to the Presidency, before being 
appointed Minister in 1999.  Prior to 1998, she was an 
advisor to the Minister of Finance.  Hawa Ahmed Youssef is 
married and has three young children. 
 
6. (C) Comment continued: Her relative youth has brought some 
criticism from those with whom Ambassador has spoken who see 
her as \"not sufficiently combative\" to make the changes on 
women\'s issues that will be required.  Nevertheless, her 
commitment seems genuine and her method may be a conscious 
decision brought about by the need to survive among her 
sensitive, and powerful, male peers rather than to alienate. 
End comment.

TAGS: EAID, PREL, PGOV, SENV, DJ 
SUBJECT: DISASTER DECLARATION FOR FLOODS 
 
REF: (A) DJIBOUTI 551; (B) DJIBOUTI 540 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: In light of unusually heavy rains 
and resulting flooding early this week and the 
inability of the host government to respond 
adequately to the needs of the population, 
Ambassador declares the situation in Djibouti 
City a disaster.  Ambassador requests that 
immediate disaster relief funding be made 
available to assist in flood relief efforts. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) On April 13, torrential rains, heavy winds 
and high tides in Djibouti caused flash flooding 
and the River Ambouli to burst its banks in the 
capital.  Fifty-one people are officially 
reported dead, 37 missing, and over 9,000 
displaced.  Although flood waters are slowly 
beginning to recede in some areas of the city, 
weather forecasts predict additional rains may 
arrive in the next few days, causing 
international aid agencies to worry that 
additional people will be displaced. 
 
3. (U) The Government of Djibouti (GODJ) has 
expressed willingness to accept any assistance 
available from the USG and other international 
donors.  GODJ does not have the technical, 
material or financial capabilities to fully 
respond to the damage caused by the flooding. 
The government reports 51 bodies recovered, 
however, the total estimated by sources on the 
ground and French military is between 200-300 
dead.  GODJ reports that 90 percent of the city 
of Djibouti\'s population has been affected. 
 
4. (U) Immediate humanitarian assistance is 
needed in the form of medicines, mosquito nets, 
foodstuff for the displaced, clothing, roofing 
materials, pots and pans, sanitation, localized 
cisterns of potable water and the draining of 
standing flood waters.  Damage to infrastructure 
includes breaks in the municipal water system, 
breaks in the railroad into the city and 
portions of roads and bridges leading to the 
city washed out.  GODJ will carry out a more 
detailed needs assessment for rehabilitation 
efforts in the coming days. 
 
5. (U) Imminent health threats possible are 
outbreaks of Cholera, Malaria, Typhoid and other 
communicable diseases.  It is in the USG\'s 
interest to assure that outbreaks and 
contamination of the city water are prevented 
as this could severely affect the well-being 
of the civilian American community, as well 
as the American military base at Camp 
Lemonier. 
 
6. (U) Most of the city\'s population lives in 
densely populated shantytowns.  The Ambouli 
section of the city was the hardest hit by flash 
flooding, as it is in the flood plain of the Wadi 
and neighbors the levys/dikes that broke in the 
floods.  Those in Ambouli that did not lose homes 
lost their livelihood since many Ambouli 
residents produce what little agriculture 
Djibouti does have.  Another concentration of 
the city\'s population lives in Balbala, one of 
the areas of higher ground in Djibouti City. 
The main route to Balbala is to cross the Wadi 
at Ambouli.  This route was completely washed 
out.  Balbala has not had municipal water 
service since the flooding began.  The higher 
income portions of the city were also severely 
affected.  Gabode, a middle class neighborhood, 
still has two feet of standing water. 
 
7. (U) Current efforts by the international 
community are being led by the French military. 
The American military medical units are testing 
the water in several areas of the city and the 
mosquito larva to try to determine what potential 
diseases are most imminent. UN organizations 
present are planning on collaborating funds and 
other resources to focus on emergency needs and 
has appealed to donors to provide emergency 
assistance. ECHO and USAID/OFDA are currently 
in the country conducting a humanitarian 
assessment and more detailed reporting will 
follow septel. 
 
8. (U) As Chief of Mission, I hereby declare 
that a flooding disaster exists in the country 
and request international disaster assistance 
funding be made available immediately. The GODJ 
is not able to adequately respond to emergency 
needs, is willing to accept international 
assistance, and it is in the best interests of 
the USG to help.  Based on emerging needs and on 
organization capabilities, Embassy requests USD 
100,000 in international disaster assistance to 
provide to the World Health Organization (WHO). 
Funding would go towards the purchase of 
emergency medical kits for cholera and malaria, 
and mosquito nets in response to the recent 
flooding, as well as assist in mitigating 
impact of additional flooding.

SUBJECT: MINISTER OF AWQAF AND ISLAMIC AFFAIRS: RELIGIOUS 
EXTREMISM NOT IN DJIBOUTI\'S NATURE 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C)  Minister of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Mogueh Samatar 
Dirir described to Ambassador, during her courtesy call April 
7, the role of his ministry as one of having authority over 
all Islamic issues affecting Djibouti.  These issues include 
the manner in which mosques and religious schools should 
operate. Its central difficulty, as a relatively new ministry 
(2 years of age), he said, is the lack of necessary resources 
to implement all the programs in its pipeline. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador inquired about the role of the High Islamic 
Council that the Ministerial Council recently established, 
under the chairmanship of the Minister of Islamic Affairs. 
The Minister affirmed the plan for a High Islamic Council and 
said its mandate is to give advice to the Government on all 
issues and concerns of a religious nature. It will also take 
charge of and coordinate the activities of all Islamic 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) present in Djibouti, 
although he did not clarify how this would be done or how the 
additional portfolio overlaps with current ministerial 
operations. The Minister added, however, that the council 
would need adequate material assistance to fully function in 
the manner the Ministerial Council envisioned. 
 
3. (C) Dirir expressed regret that funding his ministry had 
previously received from Saudi Arabia had now diminished.  He 
cited as a cause the general political and economic 
constraints on Saudi assistance worldwide that have followed 
the events of September 11, 2001 in the United States.  He 
cautioned, however, that such support in the past was never 
used for extremist purposes.  Extremism in Djibouti is not 
likely, he continued, because of the calm and non-extremist 
nature of Djiboutians and because their traditions dictate 
that they think and behave otherwise.  Dirir added that 
Djiboutians have never been easily influenced by foreign 
ideology.  He said the majority of the country\'s Muslims 
followed the moderate Shafi\'i school of religious thought, 
although the Kadiri branch of Sufism is also present. 
 
4. (C) Asked about government oversight of mosque operations, 
Dirir said that in Djibouti, each imam of a mosque is 
currently free to preach on any topic he wishes.  However, 
the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs is planning to 
begin monitoring and controlling these sermons.  He said this 
is important to ensure that imams do not tout ideas that 
might be interpreted, either by others or by Djiboutians, as 
extremist. 
 
5. (C) On women\'s issues, the  Minister said his ministry 
does not yet have, but is planning to have, a family 
education department that would be dedicated exclusively to 
issues of women in Islam.  For now, the Awqaf ministry fully 
supports the agenda of the Ministry of Women\'s Affairs, 
co-located in the same building with the Ministry of Awqaf 
and Islamic Affairs. 
 
6. (C) BIO-DATA:  Somali by origin, Dirir is believed to have 
been born in Ethiopia. He speaks Arabic and Somali, but only 
limited French.  He was appointed Djibouti\'s first \"Qadi\" 
(religious judge) after its independence from France in 1977 
and served in that position until his appointment as Minister 
in 2002.

SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER AND MINISTER OF COOPERATION OFFER 
REASSURANCES ON ISSUE OF IRAQ 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Abdi Farah, and 
Minister of Cooperation within the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA), Mohamoud Ali Youssef, both drew Ambassador 
aside April 15, on the margins of an emergency meeting with 
heads of diplomatic missions on the subject of the flood 
disaster in Djibouti, to apologize -- and to reassure her -- 
in light of negative statements made the day prior by the 
President of Djibouti\'s National Assembly, Idriss Arnaoud 
Ali, on coalition Iraq policy.  Both ministers stated that 
the National Assembly President\'s remarks did not reflect the 
official policy of Djibouti. 
 
2. (C) The controversial remarks were made in a speech by 
Idriss Arnaoud Ali during the opening ceremony April 14 of 
the National Assembly\'s first ordinary parliamentary session 
for the 5th Legislature. In attendance had been the Prime 
Minister of Djibouti, Dileita Mohamed Dileita, cabinet 
members, heads of diplomatic missions and international 
organizations accredited to Djibouti and the 65 members of 
Djibouti\'s National Assembly. 
 
3. (U) The National Assembly President\'s remarks, in our 
translation from French, were as follows: \"The difficult 
situation prevailing today in Iraq preoccupies us a great 
deal. A widespread confrontation is being placed against 
Iraqis by the coalition forces.  The latest, far from 
bringing the Iraqi people peace, prosperity and democracy, so 
much promised and so much touted, is bringing on the contrary 
death, misery, suffering and domination.  Moreover, over the 
course of the past week, this war has reached its highest 
climax.  We deplore the several hundred deaths, especially 
civilian victims, whose only offense is having reclaimed 
their national sovereignty.  This situation must not endure, 
because it is all about innocent persons, women, children, 
who aspire only to live simply, in their own homes, in their 
country, and completely free.  We have the obligation to 
awaken consciences and to decry this lack of respect for 
human rights.  The National Assembly condemns without 
reservation all attacks on the sovereignty of Iraq, asks 
forces of the coalition to evacuate this country, and to 
leave the Iraqi people free to choose their own destiny.\" 
 
4. (C) The Minister of Foreign Affairs told the Ambassador 
that the statements \"had not been cleared\" by the President 
and do not reflect official Djiboutian policy on Iraq. 
Ambassador responded that she had been concerned because the 
remarks were harsh and inbalanced. The Minister agreed and 
repeated that the remarks do not reflect policy.  A few 
minutes later, MFA Minister of Cooperation Youssef repeated 
the Foreign Minister\'s apology to Ambassador and advised her 
that he had personally chided the National Assembly President 
after they were made.  He continued that Idriss had been 
responding to the audience for which the remarks were 
tailored and had not meant to imply that they were official 
policy. 
 
5. (C) Comment: There were actually two disturbing aspects of 
the speeches given on the occasion in question:  (1) the 
remarks on Iraq by Idriss Arnaoud Ali; and (2) the remarks on 
foreign country \"partnerships\" with Djibouti, made by Prime 
Minister Dileita.  Dileita failed to mention the United 
States, and cited only France, China, the Arab world, Iran 
and India in a discussion of \"cooperation partnerships\" now 
and in the future for Djibouti. The oversight of the U.S., 
and especially the humanitarian projects of CJTF-HOA, were 
vigorously raised by Ambassador with both Ministers. It may 
indeed have been a question of the intended audience, in this 
context, but the need for officials to obfuscate may be as 
telling as their subsequent need to apologize.  End comment.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT GUELLEH REVIEWS FIVE YEARS IN OFFICE 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: To commemorate the fifth anniversary 
of his election April 9, 1999 President Guelleh held 
a press conference with local journalists (not the 
opposition) April 7 to outline what he described as his 
accomplishments. He began with a short speech and 
answered questions for more than an hour.  Guelleh\'s 
assessment of his time in office was positive, naming 
restoring peace as his greatest accomplishment.  He 
also expressed his desire to create an economic market 
that would attract foreign direct investment.  On a 
regional level, Guelleh said the Government of Djibouti 
hopes for a peaceful resolution to the Somalia issue 
and considers overall relations with neighboring 
countries good.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) On the fifth anniversary of his election as 
President of Djibouti, Ismail Omar Guelleh highlighted 
the accomplishments of his administration in the areas 
of equality and social justice, public education, 
battling social vices, and what it means to be 
Djiboutian.  He commented that five years ago he asked 
the Djiboutian people to \"accompany me in the task of 
creating a society founded on our spiritual and cultural 
components.\"  Guelleh also addressed the idea of 
independence, saying \"Independence is more than an act 
of separation from the ancient colonial power.  It is 
above all the rescue of the self-respect, of the 
dignity of the Djiboutian people who exercise their 
liberty.  But independence is a process that continues 
every day.  It is the manner in which the Djiboutians 
exist in the world and in all of life.\" 
 
3. (U) Questions to Guelleh from the press focused on 
whether Guelleh felt he had fully accomplished his 
goals politically and economically.  Guelleh commented 
that he believed he had \"restored peace to the hearts 
of our citizens.  Peace has been my best success.  I 
believe I have responded to the appeals of the most 
disadvantaged of our population.  The respect of man 
has been at the center of our strategy.\"  (Note: 
Guelleh refers to the final peace treaty ending the 
civil war signed in 2001.  End Note)  Guelleh 
emphasized that his administration has put social 
sector needs first, as a base for development of the 
country, highlighting education, health, the role of 
women, habitat and water as the most important areas. 
Guelleh reminded the audience that \"to transform or 
construct a country takes generations...but I think I 
have modestly contributed to the rebuilding of our 
nation.\" 
 
4. (U) On the growth of the economy and whether it 
would foster sustainable development, Guelleh said the 
government has started to reduce the cost of living by 
bringing the scales of internal taxes on consumption 
down from 33 percent to 8 percent.  The next step is 
to rehabilitate the infrastructure of the country by 
engaging the workforce in professional training.  \"We 
commit ourselves\" Guelleh continued \"to creating the 
conditions necessary to attract foreign direct 
investment.  But the road is long and the difficulties 
remain with the recent price of oil.\"  Guelleh 
commented that despite these difficulties the economy 
was promising, a rise in youth employment statistics 
had been reported and for the first time Djibouti\'s 
growth rate surpassed its birth rate.  Guelleh detailed 
the efforts that the government has made, emphasizing 
stabilization of public finances, reducing debt and the 
deficit, and a research program for less costly and 
renewable energy. 
 
5. (U) On the issue of corruption and reforms, Guelleh 
refuted the idea that corruption has gained the most 
ground, saying \"It is a question of education in my 
opinion...If the directors don\'t speak, don\'t teach, 
don\'t educate the people, the spread of corruption 
risks becoming dangerous for the society and for the 
country as well as the people who risk the loss of 
their soul.\"  Guelleh also commented that \"It is us 
that need the reforms more than the World Bank or the 
IMF.  It is us that need structure and discipline. 
These reforms are strong and difficult.  But we have 
passed the most difficult point.\"  Guelleh went on to 
say the IMF Staff Monitored Program negotiated this 
spring would be good for the country and the Poverty 
Reduction Strategy was finally ready for review and 
decision of the administrative council at the World 
Bank. 
 
6. (U) Guelleh wrapped up the interview by addressing 
the Somalia issue, saying \"We would like that the 
Somali people and their representatives have a chance 
to talk amongst themselves.  We recommend that the 
international community be ready to help the Somali 
people rebuild their country.\"  In response to 
questions concerning how Djibouti\'s Somalia policy has 
affected relations with Ethiopia, Guelleh commented 
the two countries are \"linked by blood and history. 
The economy further ties us together,\" and that the 
two countries are compelled to work for the good of 
both countries.  Guelleh paralleled relations with 
Somaliland to relations with Ethiopia saying, \"I am 
obliged to facilitate life for our fellow citizens 
on both sides.  The question of sovereignty or 
non-sovereignty does not concern us.  It concerns 
the people of the country that must regulate their 
own affairs with their brothers.\"

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI ACCUSES FRENCH OF TRYING TO DESTABILIZE 
THE COUNTRY 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In reaction to an April 16 French 
program broadcast on TF1 and Radio France International 
regarding new developments in the Borrel case, the 
Djiboutian government issued a statement 17 April 
accusing France of attempting to destabilize the 
government of Djibouti.  The statement also cited 
\"the American presence\" as explaining France\'s 
\"obstinate will to harm the image of Djibouti and its 
President.\"  Recent declassification of French foreign 
intelligence agency documents relating to the 1995 
death of Judge Bernard Borrel in Djibouti have brought 
back to the surface controversy over whether President 
Ismail Omar Guelleh, then Head of National Security, 
was involved in the judge\'s death.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GOVERNMENT OF DJIBOUTI\'S STATEMENT 
---------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) The office of the Presidency of the Government 
of Djibouti (GODJ) issued April 17 an official press 
release via the Agence Djiboutienne d\'Information 
(ADI - Djiboutian Information Agency) accusing France 
of \"pursuing a single and unique objective: the 
destabilization of a country.\"  The statement expressed 
the Presidency\'s extreme dissatisfaction at the 
treatment of the Borrel affair in the French media and 
considered the piece an attack on the image of the 
Djiboutian government and its President.  The statement 
called the American presence in Djibouti an explanation 
for the French government\'s \"obstinate will to harm the 
image of Djibouti and its President.\"  The statement\'s 
conclusion asserted the Djiboutian government\'s intent 
to forge its own destiny. 
 
3. (U) Following is a translation of the statement issued 
by the Djiboutian Government: 
\"Yesterday, observers experienced some difficulty 
understanding the underlying motives and political meaning 
behind the media attack on the Borrel affair and 
accusations directed at the Republic of Djibouti and its 
President.  It appears today that the French state pursues 
a single and unique objective: the destabilization of a 
country. 
 
In fact, how else can one explain that from one note 
written by an agent of the DGSE immediately following 
the decision to declassify documents relating to the 
death of Judge Bernard Borrel, one hastily concludes 
that it was a political assassination. 
 
Convinced that it would be useful for all parties to put 
a definitive end to the controversy, Djibouti took the 
initiative 27 August 2003 to request that French 
authorities lift the secrecy from this affair.  A 
favorable response came on 10 March 2004.  But it was 
without planning on the manipulation and the will of 
the French government to cause harm.  This last, 
specialist in late recoveries, and little inclined to 
research the truth, engages once more in a media campaign, 
putting to work its agents of propaganda, RFI and TF1, 
who repeat hypnotically a single message: the 
assassination of Judge Borrel is no longer a doubt; It 
was President Guelleh and his entourage who were 
responsible for this.  It is in this manner that a 
poorly advised series, incoherent enough and which 
carries indelible traces of State manipulation, refers 
to the attacks at the Cafe de Paris in 1990.  One must 
remember that on the date Judge Borrel was assigned to 
Djibouti, the Cafe de Paris affair had already been 
tried, the perpetrators convicted and the case closed. 
 
It is permissible to suppose that if President Ismail 
Omar Guelleh bothers France, it is because he always 
poses himself as a leader who defends the promotion of 
the national interest.  He is the one who knew how to 
foil the strategy to divide the country, conceived and 
developed by France.  A strategy which unfortunately 
saw relative success in other areas of Africa, leading 
to a fate of inexpressible suffering and 
unconscionable misery. 
 
To those who know how to decipher the French political 
speech, the American presence in Djibouti explains the 
obstinate will to harm the image of Djibouti and its 
President. 
 
But it is in the exercise of its legitimate right to 
sovereignty that Djibouti establishes friendships and 
cooperation with the countries with whom it shares 
common values! 
 
Djibouti is determined to forge its own destiny.  The 
Djiboutian people, conscious of the stakes, support 
the President and his government in the pursuit of 
development objectives.\"

BACKGROUND ON THE BORREL CASE 
---------------------------- 
4. (SBU) The French judge Bernard Borrel, assigned to 
Djibouti in the early 1990\'s, was found burned at the 
bottom of a ravine on October 19, 1995.  The Djiboutian 
investigation of Borrel\'s death led to a conclusion of 
suicide, though no autopsy was done in Djibouti and the 
X-rays taken were not made available to French 
investigators.  Borrel\'s body was repatriated and 
buried in France, November 1995.  At that time, 
Borrel\'s wife initiated a request for an autopsy and 
investigation in the Court of Toulouse on the cause of 
Borrel\'s death.  The autopsy was done in February 1996, 
but results were not released for a full year.  The 
autopsy revealed Borrel had no soot in his lungs and 
therefore, did not die from burning. 
 
5. (SBU) After the autopsy, Elisabeth Borrel found 
documents among her husbands effects, relating to the 
Cafe de Paris attack in Djibouti in 1990.  The 
documents mentioned a request for audits of the case. 
Borrel had acted as the coordinator between the 
Djiboutian judge and the French judge in charge of the 
case, where Ismail Omar Guelleh is believed to be 
involved.  November 1997, French judges Roger le Loire 
and Marie-Paule Morrachini were nominated to look into 
the case.  In January 2000, their investigation turned 
up testimony from a witness who affirmed that judge 
Borrel was assassinated.  Mohamed Saleh Alhoumekani, a 
former officer in the Presidential Guard, accused 
Guelleh of ordering the killing of judge Borrel.  He 
claimed to have overheard a conversation on October 19, 
1995 between Guelleh and five men, one of whom said 
\"mission accomplished! The nosy judge is dead!\" 
 
6. (SBU) After no new results for several years, Mrs. 
Borrel pushed the case to be transferred to a new judge, 
Jean-Baptist Parlos.  Parlos ordered an exhumation and 
new autopsy of Borrel\'s body after a trip to Djibouti 
with three forensic experts in February 2002.  This 
autopsy revealed the cause to be a \"violent death due 
to external causes.\"  Cranial trauma, a fracture of the 
left forearm and an alternation of burned areas of the 
body led experts to believe that Borrel was killed by a 
blow to the head before being burned.  Based on the 
evidence from the new autopsy the prosecutor supports 
the medical experts\' theory that it was a murder.  In 
November 2003, the newest judge on the case requested 
declassification of ten documents held by the DGSE 
(French foreign intelligence agency) relating to the 
Borrel case.  The ten documents were released March 27, 
2004 causing a renewed media interest in the case. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: The Government\'s reaction to the 
French broadcast is strong and included ordering the 
French to stop work on disaster assistance in the 
aftermath of flooding in Djibouti.  The government 
also launched a media campaign of its own in an 
attempt to cast doubt on the veracity of the French 
broadcast.  Embassy will comment septel on 
implications for Djibouti-French relations and 
evaluate government of Djibouti accusation that 
France\'s actions at this time are linked to jealousy 
over U.S.-Djibouti relations.  End Comment.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
1. (U) This is a USAID/DCHA/OFDA reporting cable, which 
provides analysis on the humanitarian situation in Djibouti, 
following OFDA Regional Advisor\'s April 15-18 assessment on 
the impact of last week\'s flash floods. 
 
2. (U) In light of unusually heavy rains, resulting flooding 
and the inability of the host government to adequately 
respond, the US Ambassador declared a disaster in Djibouti 
on April 16 (reftel).  Although estimated deaths are 
expected to be much higher, 51 people are officially 
reported dead, 23 injured, 37 people missing and 9,000 
displaced to date.  United Nations agencies and U.S. and 
French military forces have assisted in emergency relief 
efforts and are working with the Government of Djibouti 
(GODJ) to determine additional needs.  The most pressing 
humanitarian concerns are focused on preventing widespread 
cholera, typhoid and other epidemics which followed similar 
flooding in 1994, and pre-positioned supplies will be 
critical. 
 
3. (U) USAID has responded to the emergency through 
USAID/OFDA\'s provision of USD 100,000 in international 
disaster assistance funds to the UN World Health 
Organization (WHO) for emergency health kits for cholera and 
diarrhea.  In addition, the U.S. military, in close 
collaboration with French military stationed in Djibouti, 
has provided 100 body bags, six water pumps and emergency 
water storage containers, and infrastructure repair on 
damaged roads and railroads.  DCHA/OFDA and Embassy Djibouti 
believe that the USG response has thus far, reflected an 
appropriate level of emergency support to the flooding 
disaster in Djibouti.  As additional needs emerge for 
mitigation, rehabilitation and recovery efforts, assistance 
from other donors should also be encouraged.  End summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Flooding in Djibouti 
-------------------- 
4. (SBU) On April 13, a combination of torrential rains, 
strong winds and high tides caused flash flooding and the 
River Ambouli to burst its banks.  Although the floods were 
sudden onset, the ground had already been saturated by 
watershed from heavy rains from the Ethiopian highlands. In 
the early hours of the morning, water levels rose several 
meters high within minutes in the Ambouli, Djebel, Gabode 
and Boulaos quarters of the city.  Since most of the 
population was sleeping and caught unprepared, flood waters 
rapidly swept away people and livestock.  The French 
military responded quickly and were able to rescue hundreds 
of people stranded on rooftops.  Although the GODJ has 
officially recovered 51 bodies, many bodies have not yet 
been recovered and the total estimated dead by the local 
population and French military is between 200-350. 
 
5. (U) Heavy damage in several neighborhoods is evident, as 
flood waters destroyed structures and damaged contents of 
homes and businesses.  Water and electricity supply has been 
cut in the most affected areas and damage to infrastructure 
includes breaks in the municipal water system, breaks in the 
railroad into the city and portions of roads and bridges 
leading to the city washed out.  Efforts are underway to 
restore water and electricity, which is expected to be 
available soon.  Rehabilitation work is also underway on the 
damaged roads and railroads, particularly as these represent 
the main trade routes between Djibouti-Ethiopia, and thus, 
the largest revenue generator. 
 
6. (SBU) In the most affected areas, houses were completely 
destroyed, displacing roughly 9,000 people.  The displaced 
have been temporarily sheltered in a primary school, but the 
GODJ reportedly want to resettle the displaced in new areas 
southwest of the city, where there are minimal or non- 
existent services.  International agencies have expressed 
concern about humanitarian implications if the GODJ moves 
forward without sufficient planning. 
 
7. (SBU) Much of the city\'s poor population lives in densely 
populated shantytowns (reftel).  Although water is beginning 
to recede, areas of the city with lower elevation have over 
a meter of water remaining.  With the resulting clean water 
shortages, stagnant muddy water already contaminated by 
livestock carcasses and broken sewage pipes, and 
environmental damage from the flood, the threats of epidemic 
prone diseases such as cholera are of pressing concern, 
particularly since water and vector borne diseases are 
already endemic in Djibouti.  (Note: the last major flood 
here occurred in 1994 and an estimated 120 people died. 
Following the 1994 floods, an outbreak of 8,000 cases of 
cholera and 32 deaths were registered.  End note.) 
 
8.  (U) The UN World Health Organization (WHO) and the 
Ministry of Health (MOH) estimate that 10,000 people in 
affected flooded areas are particularly vulnerable to a 
cholera epidemic, based on current conditions and 
similarities to the 1994 floods.  The floods have also 
disrupted provision of basic health services due to the 
total or partial destruction of main health care facilities 
in the area, notably the centers in Farahad, Ibrahim Balala, 
Arhiba and Amouli, which cover a population of 90,000 
people.  Medical equipment, drugs, cold chain and nutrition 
substitution stocks were lost.  The MOH is heading a health 
emergency group, which includes the UN, to rapidly re- 
establish basic health services in the affected areas, 
install emergency surveillance for epidemic prone diseases 
and strengthen preparedness for the expected cholera 
outbreak.  A response plan for cholera outbreaks has been 
developed by the MOH. 
 
-------------------------- 
Emergency Response to Date 
-------------------------- 
9. (SBU) Due to limited disaster response capacities within 
the country, a strongly coordinated multi-sectoral emergency 
response has not been evident outside of international 
organizations and the military. The strongest GODJ efforts 
have come from the MOH, who have developed emergency health 
response plans with WHO, repaired damaged health clinics and 
sent out mobile health teams for surveillance of epidemics. 
While the GODJ has clearly indicated that it will coordinate 
all relief efforts, international agencies are working hard 
to bolster these efforts.  Emergency assistance provided to 
date by various agencies includes: 
 
A) USAID: USD 100,000 provided by USAID/OFDA in response to 
the Ambassador\'s disaster declaration.  Disaster funds will 
be immediately channeled through the WHO for emergency 
health kits.  Emergency medical kits are expected to arrive 
by the end of the week from pre-positioned WHO stockpiles. 
Other development funds may be reprogrammed by USAID for 
mitigation and recovery efforts depending on the needs and 
priorities of the GODJ.  [Note: other donors have not yet 
provided funding for relief efforts, however the European 
Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) conducted a rapid 
assessment of the situation last week and may consider 
providing assistance pending identified needs. End note.] 
 
B) French Military: initial assistance included rescue of 
people stranded in the floods, utilizing heavy equipment to 
clear damaged railroads and roads, particularly along the 
Djibouti to Ethiopia road; removal of bodies and provision 
of body bags. Although the French military, assisted by the 
U.S. military, had begun working on repair of the city water 
supply system, the military has been pulled off working on 
the system and the Djiboutians have officially taken over 
repairs.  Recently aired French TV documentaries over the 
alleged political assassination of French Judge Bernard 
Borrel in 1994 led to heightened political sensitivities 
(detailed septel), which has impacted some relief efforts 
underway by the military. 
 
C) U.S. Military: in close coordination with the French 
military, the U.S. military has assisted in repairing 
damaged road, railroad and water supply infrastructure, 
provided 100 body bags, six water pumps and 350-gallon water 
storage containers, as well as sent medical teams out to 
sample the water and monitor health indicators. 
 
D) UN Country Team: WHO, UNDP, UNICEF and WFP are 
coordinating closely to determine additional needs for 
emergency and recovery responses.  The UN has requested 
disaster funds from their respective agency headquarters, 
which will be channeled into a coordinated response effort, 
addressing gaps not covered by other donors. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
10. (SBU) Despite political undercurrents and the GODJ 
desire to be seen as the only one leading and responding in 
the disaster efforts, stronger government capacity to manage 
disasters is needed since the country will always be 
vulnerable to climatic shocks. 
 
11. (SBU) Djibouti\'s greatest challenge continues to be 
underlying poverty, which is compounded by a wide range of 
structural constraints, particularly its limited natural and 
human resources and arid climate.  The economy remains 
fragile and UNDP estimates that Djibouti\'s per capita GDP 
has decreased in the past five years.  Many of the overall 
problems that Djibouti faces stem from chronic poverty and 
vulnerability. 
 
12. (SBU) DCHA/OFDA and Embassy Djibouti believe that the 
USG response has reflected an appropriate level of emergency 
support to the flooding disaster in Djibouti.  As additional 
needs emerge for mitigation, rehabilitation and recovery 
efforts, assistance from other donors should be encouraged. 
USAID and Embassy Djibouti will continue to closely monitor 
the humanitarian situation.  RAGSDALE

SUBJECT: FRENCH AMBASSADOR ON FLAP WITH DJIBOUTI GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 585 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) Ambassador held a long meeting April 20 with France\'s 
Ambassador to Djibouti, Philippe Selz to talk about 
French-Djibouti relations in light of the recent flap between 
the two countries over an outstanding matter involving the 
death in Djibouti in 1995 of Judge Bernard Borrel, a French 
national (see reftel).  In two harsh editorials April 19 in 
the government mouthpiece \"La Nation\", the French state was 
accused of using the death of the judge \"to serve its own 
strategic interest.\"  The editorials also said that calling 
the death of Borrel a political assassination perpetrated by 
the highest ranking people in Djibouti \"is actually a coup.\" 
France was also accused in the editorials of being the 
\"originator of the Rwandan genocide\" and of \"trying to 
destabilize its former French colonies.\" 
 
2. (C) The diatribe continued with accusations in the 
editorials that France was \"worried about its shrinking 
influence since Djibouti agreed to accommodate the American 
army,\" was looking down on \"the installation in Djibouti of 
the world superpower,\" and was \"irritated\" by the fact \"that 
American businesses might play a part in the Doraleh (port) 
project.\"  Djibouti\'s leaders, the editorial continued, \"will 
not be intimidated by the gesticulations of a colonial power 
which, receiving ill will in Europe, returns to Africa to 
recharge its power.\"  The ferocity of the editorials raised 
eyebrows and provoked much local speculation on their 
implications. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador initiated the meeting with Selz, who told 
her that President Guelleh had indeed been extremely angered 
by an April 16 French broadcast that carried remarks by the 
attorney for Judge Borrel\'s widow implicating Guelleh in the 
death of the judge. (reftel)  He gave a history of the Borrel 
affair, and said he expected it to remain in the public 
spotlight for quite some time as a lingering irritant in 
France-Djibouti relations. (Note: Selz used the term 
\"embarrassant\" to describe the affair\'s continuing impact. 
End note) Selz explained that Borrel\'s widow, herself a 
judge, is pursuing the matter religiously on the 
circumstances of her husband\'s death and has taken solace in 
statements of a member of the Djibouti opposition who has 
implicated Guelleh. 
 
4. (C) Selz said Djibouti\'s government officially demanded of 
France a public statement which, in essence, would deny the 
involvement of Guelleh in the death of Borrel.  Selz said he 
tried to explain that France could not comment publicly on an 
ongoing judicial investigation nor could it muzzle the free 
French press.  He said he reinforced in remarks to his 
Djiboutian interlocutors that France\'s government had played 
no part in, nor was in a position to deny or confirm, the 
remarks made by Mrs. Borrel\'s attorney in the televised April 
16 broadcast.  He said he did consult with his government, 
however, and a statement was issued by the French Foreign 
Ministry on April 17.  That statement, shared by Selz with 
Ambassador, and unofficially translated by Embassy, is as 
follows: 
 
Begin text: The attorney for the Borrel family spoke 
yesterday evening on TF1 regarding a judicial proceeding that 
is currently in process.  It is not appropriate for the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to comment on this. 
- 
On the other hand, we are keen to reaffirm the excellent 
cooperation the Djiboutian authorities have given in this 
affair, notably in the realm of international fact-finding 
commissions. 
- 
In particular, each time the cooperation of Djiboutian 
authorities was requested, they have granted without delay. 
 
End text. 
 
5. (C) Selz told Ambassador that this statement did not 
satisfy the Djiboutian government.  He said he has asked his 
government to consider issuing another statement which he 
hoped would be sufficiently strong to cool down tensions here 
yet not compromise this ongoing judicial investigation. The 
language he has proposed states, inter alia, that on the 
basis of recently declassified information, there is no 
implication of the involvement of the Djiboutian government 
in the death of Judge Borrel.  This would leave open, Selz 
said, the question of whether additional declassified 
information would reveal otherwise.   Privately, Selz said, 
there are indications that Borrel\'s death may well have been 
a suicide, if one considers some of the evidence and 
observations of those familiar with the case. 
 
6. (C) Selz also said that he had asked Foreign Minister Ali 
Abdi Farah to explain the Government of Djibouti\'s reference 
in its presidential communique on the subject of Borrel 
(issued August 17) in which Djibouti accused France of a 
\"strategy to divide\" the country.  Selz said Farah responded 
that he did not know.  Selz then told Farah that his 
government will ask him to explain this point and needed to 
have that information.  Farah agreed to call Selz back, did 
so, and stated that the reference was to the previous 
government of France\'s efforts to support Afars over Issas. 
Selz remarked that the Djiboutians did not want to understand 
that governments, as well as policies, in France do change. 
 
7. (C) Ambassador told Selz she had been troubled by the tone 
of the editorials but also by the Government of Djibouti\'s 
attempt to draw into the discussion, on an explicit basis, 
the U.S. presence in Djibouti.  She said there is no 
relationship between the Borrel case and the U.S. presence 
and the statements could well be viewed as an effort to use 
the U.S. presence to place pressure on France in this case. 
She noted that the U.S. and France are continuing to work 
well together in Djibouti -- as they did in last week\'s flood 
relief efforts -- and fully expects that relationship to 
continue.  Selz stated that he also saw the reference as an 
attempt to put pressure on France.  He lamented, though, that 
the case is not likely to go away soon, therefore he is 
recommending that a direct phone call occur between the 
President of France and the President of Djibouti, but is not 
sure if, or when, this might happen. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  Selz seemed taken aback by Guelleh\'s 
reaction on the Borrel issue, admitting this was the 
strongest France has seen on any issue between the two 
countries.  We thought it important to reassure him on U.S. 
intentions and also to make clear to France our strong 
aversion to Djibouti\'s efforts to draw our presence here into 
the matter.  We think the issue will cool down on its own as 
there will be strong domestic economic pressure as well on 
Guelleh to keep ties with France open and clear.  Ambassador 
was told by a prominent Djiboutian business person that 
Guelleh was \"not well-served\" by his advisors in his 
\"childish\" public handling of the French broadcast. Some 
speculate that the President\'s wrath over the issue was 
little more than a \"qat moment,\" which his handlers ran away 
with. End comment.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (U) Djibouti\'s media is giving broad coverage to a joint 
statement issued April 20 by France\'s Ministries of Defense 
and Foreign Affairs on the controversial Judge Bernard Borrel 
affair, involving the state of Djibouti (see reftels).  The 
text, unofficially translated by Embassy Djibouti, is as 
follows: 
- 
\"Within the framework of the investigation underway into the 
death of Judge Borrel, some documents classified 
\"secret-defense\" have recently been declassified.  This 
measure had been requested by the Djiboutian authorities 
themselves. It has allowed these documents to be added to the 
case file.  Contrary to assertions put forward by diverse 
organs of the press, nothing in these documents permit one to 
conclude that the Djiboutian authorities are involved.  Any 
other statement does not conform to reality.\" 
 
2. (C) The text of the statement is along the lines of the 
language France\'s Ambassador Philippe Selz had proposed to 
his government, and that he said he believed might help calm 
matters between the countries. (See reftel A).  Selz 
telephoned Ambassador April 21 to state that \"the storm is 
over,\" at least for now.  He told Ambassador, and French 
General Gerard Pons, Commander of French Forces stationed in 
Djibouti subsequently confirmed to her, that relations 
between Djibouti and France are returning to normal.  Both 
said that earlier, French military forces had resumed their 
routine interactions with Djiboutian forces. 
 
3. (C) Comment: The concern of French officials here is that 
real control over the case\'s publicity ultimately rests with 
Borrel\'s widow.  She is not likely to keep the matter low-key 
and we cannot predict future Djiboutian government reactions 
to any new revelations in this tragic case.  End comment.

SUMMARY 
--------- 
 
1. (U) U.S. Citizen Alan Funk (PPT# 156160695) has received a 
six month suspended prison sentence and a 1.6 million DF 
(U.S.$9,040) fine from the Djiboutian court of appeals for 
his role in a March 2000 traffic accident in which a 
Djiboutian man was killed.  Funk was absolved of any 
wrongdoing in the same case by a criminal court in November 
of 2000.  The overturning of the case four years later 
appears to involve serious and fraudulent misapplications of 
justice by the Djiboutian court of appeals.  If the decision 
stands upon second appeal to the Djiboutian Supreme Court USG 
intervention may be required to protect the rights of this 
American Citizen.  End Summary. 
 
THE ACCIDENT AND INITIAL VERDICT 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) American Citizen Warden Alan Funk (PPT# 156160695), an 
employee of International Development Relief Board (IDRB), a 
non-governmental organization, was sentenced to six months 
suspended imprisonment and 1.6 million DF (U.S.$9,040) in 
damages by a Djiboutian appeals court on April 17, 2004 for 
his role in a March, 2000 traffic accident in which a man was 
killed.  The sentence comes nearly four years after Funk was 
found innocent by a criminal court of any wrongdoing in 
November of 2000.  Funk\'s local attorney has appealed,  to 
the Djiboutian Supreme Court, the appeals\' court overturning 
and subsequent sentencing. 
 
3. (U) Funk reported to Conoff that in March of 2000, despite 
his best efforts to avoid contact, the car he was driving 
struck and killed a Djiboutian pedestrian on the Route 
D\'Arta, the only paved road departing Djibouti City.  Funk 
claims the man he struck was naked, deranged, and wandering 
aimlessly along the fast moving road.  Funk claims he later 
heard that the man had been chained to a tree in his family\'s 
compound before escaping to wander onto the highway. 
Eyewitness testimony by a Djiboutian citizen presented to the 
criminal court was largely responsible for his acquittal in 
November of 2000. 
 
4. (U) Funk received notice on April 17 that the Djiboutian 
court of appeals had overturned the criminal court\'s 2000 
decision.  According to Funk\'s legal council, French citizen 
Alain Martinet (note: also Post\'s legal retainer), the 
aggrieved party (the deranged man\'s family) had two years to 
file an appeal to the criminal court\'s decision.  When Funk\'s 
legal council raised this with the Appeals Court, the Appeals 
Court responded that the \"registry had been lost\" and thus it 
was impossible to say when the appeal had been filed.  Funk 
believes the family is upset that they have not received any 
compensation for the death as they might have under 
traditional Somali conflict resolution practices and so now 
want to seek damages in civil court.  Funk\'s acquittal in 
2000 makes it nearly impossible for the family to win any 
damages in civil court but if this appeals court conviction 
stands, the family\'s case in civil court would be much 
stronger. 
 
POLITICAL BACKDROP 
------------------ 
 
5. (C) This case is the second apparent misapplication of 
justice (see reftels) at the appeals court level in Djibouti. 
 At the behest of Exxon-Mobil, post had encouraged the 
Djiboutian government to remove or otherwise sanction several 
corrupt appeals court judges.  Post received strong but 
informal messages from the Minister of Justice, the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of the Presidency that 
\"the matter will be taken care of.\"  To date, post has seen 
no positive governmental action on the matter.  To the 
contrary, two of the most notorious judges were recently 
named to head the controversial \"cours de contentieux.\"  This 
is the branch of the appeals court which handles abuses of 
power and the post had been vacant for some eight years as 
highlighted in the Department\'s 2003 Human Rights Report on 
Djibouti. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) In light of recent Embassy approaches to Djiboutian 
officials on the urgent need for judicial reform, this 
seemingly mundane traffic \"manslaughter\" is notable.  Four 
years after his acquittal, in a case that resembles 
Exxon-Mobil\'s problems with forged court records and lost 
files, this respected American Citizen Warden who has worked 
in East Africa for over 20 years is convicted and sentenced 
by the very court at the heart of Embassy concerns.  We can 
only speculate whether this apparent miscarriage of justice 
is also motivated by showing the Embassy who defines the 
\"rule of law\" in Djibouti.  Regardless, we will continue 
working with Exxon-Mobil on their case, and wait to see if 
this case must be added to our grievance list. End comment.

SUBJECT: DORALEH PORT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS 
IN DJIBOUTI 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The prospective mega-project at 
Doraleh port in Djibouti offers significant 
opportunities for U.S. companies.  Dubai Ports 
International has hired an American company, 
Han-Padron Associates of New York, to do the 
feasibility study and full market forecast for all 
aspects of the project.  Moreover, a Master Plan 
for port sectors is to be completed by mid-November 
2004.  DPI and Han-Padron recently held talks in 
Washington with USTDA and EXIM on financing for this 
portion of the project.  A major issue to be resolved 
is the future of the existing oil company business in 
Djibouti - including U.S. company Exxon Mobil - once 
Emirates National Oil Company assumes management of a 
new oil container terminal envisioned for the new 
port.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Ambassador and Pol/Econ met April 15 with 
visiting Dubai Ports International (DPI) officials and 
American company Han-Padron Associates regarding future 
developments on the Doraleh Port project and to hear 
their brief on USTDA and EXIM meetings the group held 
in Washington the week prior.  DPI won its first 
contract with the Port of Djibouti in 1999.  Since 
then, DPI has acquired the contract for management of 
the Ambouli International Airport in Djibouti.  DPI 
told Ambassador and Pol/Econ that it appreciated the 
presence of both Djiboutian government officials and 
Department of State representatives at the Washington 
meetings.  They felt their presence gave greater 
credibility to their presentation to EXIM and TDA. 
 
TAKING PRELIMINARY STEPS 
------------------------ 
3. (SBU) DPI stated that from a business viewpoint, 
Djibouti is in line with the future of shipping in the 
region and that the Government of Dubai supports 
finding a commercially and financially feasible way to 
develop port possibilities in Djibouti.  In January 
2004 DPI put out a Request for Proposals (RFP) to get a 
development study and project started.  DPI began the 
bid process for Sole Source funding on February 15. 
Through a competitive bidding process, American company 
Han-Padron Associates was chosen to do the feasibility 
study and full market forecast for all sectors of the 
project: airport, port, free-zone, etc.  It will be 
necessary to study the current port as well as the 
future container terminal to answer pivotal questions 
on the development process, such as how does migration 
to the new container terminal facility happen and what 
is to be done with the current oil terminal. 
 
A MASTER PLAN IN THE WORKS 
-------------------------- 
4. (SBU) The creation of a Master Plan for Port sectors 
is to be completed by mid-November.  This plan will 
include what to do with the current port facility and 
how to take care of pollution at the oil terminal in 
that port.  DPI\'s view is that if there is a stable 
competitive service provider within a short distance 
from the East-West shipping route, there would be strong 
potential for use of Djibouti for transshipment 
activities from Dubai.  This possibility can provide a 
large potential economic benefit for Djibouti. 
Han-Padron brought TSG, a free-zone specialist based in 
Washington DC, Black & Veech, to look at water and 
electricity, and Mercator out of Tacoma, Washington to 
look at the marketing forecast.  DPI said it is very 
interested in working with the three American companies 
on the Doraleh project. 
 
NEED FOR QUICK TDA ACTION 
------------------------- 
5. (SBU) DPI mentioned one caveat: if the decision by 
USTDA to fund the feasibility study does not come 
quickly, DPI will have to look elsewhere immediately 
for financing.  It is under pressure from the 
Government of Djibouti to move forward.  The estimated 
cost of the project, from preliminary studies, is $300 
million.  This amount would rise to $750 million if 
the free-zone, water and electricity were added. 
Han-Padron will study the costs, and pros and cons of 
the project and whether the move to Doraleh will be 
financially and economically beneficial.  DPI is 
confident that over the lifetime of the project, a 
good return on investment is likely based on similar 
experiences in India and Romania.  The DPI official 
said the outlook is based on a project\'s predictions 
of minimal profit returns. 
 
ROLE FOR ENOC 
------------- 
6. (SBU) Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC) has 
contracted with the Government of Djibouti to build a 
21-tank farm at Doraleh with a capacity of 235,000 
cubic meters.  These tanks will be made available by 
ENOC for commercial leasing.  DPI addressed the concern 
expressed by oil companies currently in Djibouti, that 
the ENOC contract was a move to push them out of the 
Djiboutian market.  DPI clarified that these companies 
will have to lease a tank from ENOC and relocate to 
Doraleh if they choose to continue to do business in 
Djibouti.  The amount of pollution caused by existing 
tanks cannot be sustained, DPI said.  DPI indicated that 
the possibility of increased transshipment could allow 
the Djiboutian market to hold multiple competitors and 
emphasized that ENOC is not going to take existing 
business from others but will bring in new business. 
The oil farm project is set to go operational May 31, 
2005. 
 
THE LABOR QUESTION AND THE FUTURE 
--------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) Addressing the issue of employment and finding 
necessary skilled labor, DPI said the Master Plan will 
provide answers to these issues.  It is clear, DPI said, 
that a large number of skilled workers would need to be 
brought in for the construction of the facility.  DPI 
is also interested in promoting entrepreneurship in 
Djibouti and is looking to find seed projects to fund 
that would create business opportunities.  These 
businesses would then be encouraged to seek contracts 
with the port. 
 
8. (SBU) DPI said for the duration of the construction 
(15 months) it would like to have two Han-Padron 
associates on the ground in Djibouti to provide 
independent supervision.  The representatives hoped 
that, once they had procured office space and were set 
up, the Ambassador and the Embassy would stay in close 
contact.  Embassy pledged to do so.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR INAUGURATES SELF-HELP SEWING WORKSHOP 
PROJECT 
 
1.(U) Summary: The Ambassador, Pol/Econ and Self-Help 
Clerk traveled April 28, to the southern 
city of Dikhil to inaugurate a Self-Help project for 
the Dikhil Women\'s Union.  Hosted by the District 
Commissaire, the Ambassador toured Dikhil, including 
several farms and the town\'s computer center. 
Ambassador also met with the Commissaire and two of 
the twelve Dikhil district parliamentarians.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) In her first official visit to the outlying 
regions, Ambassador Ragsdale, accompanied by Pol/Econ 
and Self-Help Clerk, presided over the opening of a 
Sewing Workshop for the Women\'s Association in Dikhil. 
The Self-Help program gave a $5,000 grant to the 
Association Development de la Corne d\'Afrique, a 
non-governmental organization led by a parliamentarian 
from the Dikhil district, to finance a sewing workshop 
for the Dikhil Women\'s Union.  This grant was the first 
in more than a decade given to benefit the Women\'s Union. 
The sewing workshop had previously received a donation 
of ten sewing machines from UNICEF.  At the initial site 
visit to the proposed project, most of these machines 
were worn-out or non-functioning.  The $5,000 grant 
provided the sewing workshop with new equipment and 
material.  The women use their sewing center to display 
and sell their products to visitors.  The workshop will 
also serve as a valuable teaching facility for the 
town\'s young women and provide many with the 
possibility of earning their own income. 
 
3. (U) The Ambassador was escorted from the border of 
the Dikhil district into town by the gendarmerie and 
was met with a very warm welcome from the residents. 
Ambassador met immediately with the District 
Commissaire and two parliamentarians from Dikhil. 
Following the meeting Ambassador opened and toured 
the sewing workshop.  They extended an official welcome 
and Ambassador expressed her pleasure in having the 
opportunity to meet the Commissaire and inaugurate the 
center, which was followed by a visit to the town\'s 
computer training center.  Funded by a local 
businessman, the center provides training in computer 
applications to high school level students and 
businessmen.  The center also provides a connection to 
the Internet, courtesy of Djibouti Telecom, though it 
is only available to students and not all residents. 
 
4. (U) The day also included a roundtable discussion 
with other non-governmental organizations from Dikhil. 
Comments from the many associations were appreciative 
of American help and interest, but also offered a 
local perspective on American activities.  One 
association representative commented that America 
should work for peace throughout the world and not 
practice favoritism.  The secretary of the Women\'s 
Union commented that it was good to finally see the 
female side of American assistance.  The secretary 
nicknamed the Ambassador \"a new mother to the Women\'s 
Union.\"  The secretary\'s reference to previous American 
assistance was that of a well dug outside the city in 
September 2003 by the Civil Affairs team at Camp 
Lemonier.  Another association head entreated the 
Ambassador to not let this interest in Dikhil be the 
first and last.  Ambassador responded with brief remarks 
on development and the rededication of U.S. commitment 
to advancing rights and opportunities of women 
everywhere. 
 
5. (U) Following the roundtable discussion, the 
Ambassador toured the area around Dikhil, including 
two fruit farms and the well dug by the American 
military.  The well, the first half of a two part 
project, was not in use.  The parliamentarians and 
farmers explained that the American part of the 
project was to dig the 120 meter well and put in a pump, 
but the second half of the project was yet to be 
completed by the Office National des Eaux de Djibouti 
(ONED).  ONED\'s portion was to provide canalization from 
the well to the surrounding farms and to the town. 
There was no estimate on when this portion of the 
project would start.  The owners of the farms were part 
of the Agriculture Society of Dikhil and were pleased 
to welcome the Ambassador on a tour.  Two of the farmers 
who grew fruit gave the Ambassador bags of mangos, 
lemons and limes to take back to the Embassy.  A third 
farmer presented the Ambassador with a baby goat as a 
gift, presumably to eat,  although it has recently been 
adopted by an American officer at the Embassy. 
 
6. (U) Dikhil is known as the \"District of Unity\" 
throughout Djibouti.  With a population of 70,000 and a 
territory of 7,200 square meters, Dikhil\'s population 
is a conglomeration of all of Djibouti\'s ethnic groups - 
Somali, Afar and Arab.  The Commissaire said, in his 
meeting with the Ambassador before the inauguration, that 
the Dikhil District is one of the few places in Djibouti 
where the different groups live together as one community 
and not merely cohabitate.  The unique mixture of 
populations has led the governing authorities in Dikhil 
to create policies that all groups agree on.  The 
Commissaire also noted that because Dikhil has a large 
portion of nomads in its population, it has tailored its 
voting procedures to the nomadic heritage.  The district 
allows registration lists to be distributed to all 
polling centers in the Dikhil district so that a nomadic 
family is not tied to one single polling center, so long 
as it is within the Dikhil borders.

1. (S) Post convened a meeting of the Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) on 02 May, 2004 to review threat information 
as outlined in REFTEL and recent threat reporting from other 
sources.  The EAC discussed the potential of attacks on 
western targets and the addition of needed security measures 
to mitigate the threat.  Potential targets in Djibouti 
include the Embassy, the U.S. Military Base Camp Lemonier, 
and frequented establishments in the downtown area.  In 
addition, the EAC addressed the potential risk of personal 
attacks to American and other Western civilians as a result 
of the recent media exposure of inappropriate behavior on 
behalf of U.S. and British troops in Iraq. 
 
2. (S) The EAC was composed of the Ambassador, DCM, RSO, RAO, 
USLO, MgtOff, ConOff, PolOff and newly appointed Force 
Protection Officer (FPO).  The contents of REFTEL were 
discussed in detail and all parties agreed that current 
physical security measures at the Embassy remain sufficient 
to deter or disrupt an attack.  Mission personnel have been 
at a heightened level for a period of time and are carrying 
out appropriate personal security measures.  Recent physical 
security enhancements to the Embassy include: 
 
- The relocation of concrete barriers on to the adjacent lot 
for the purpose of increasing set back and impeding vehicle 
entry. 
- The placement of new 6 ft. concrete barriers on the 
beachhead behind the Embassy to increase set back and to 
prevent a breach of the perimeter by waterborne vessels. 
- The installation of portable drop arm barriers on the 
street in front of the Embassy to secure the street and 
prevent a breach of the perimeter by a VBIED. 
 
3. (SBU) Appropriate Military representatives from Camp 
Lemonier are aware of the current threat and will take 
measures IAW their SOPs.  US Military elements are also 
coordinating with the host nation and the French Forces in 
Djibouti (FFD) who have a formal defense agreement with the 
Government of Djibouti. 
 
4. (S) The EAC agreed that due to the general threat of 
attacks against Americans world wide and recent threat 
information emanating from the capture of Al Qaeda operatives 
in Djibouti, it would be prudent to reiterate the need for 
vigilance and personal security measures to the American 
community.  ConOff has forwarded the Departments world wide 
warning to all wardens and members of the community and has 
reiterated the need to maintain a low profile and strongly 
consider postponing activities that involve large groups of 
Americans or Westerners.  The Ambassador has scheduled a town 
hall meeting for community members on 09 May, 2004.  The 
Ambassador, RSO and ConOff will address current security 
concerns at that time.  In addition, The Ambassador will 
raise US security concerns officially with the Government of 
Djibouti. 
 
5. (S/NF) Note: Embassy and military officers have queried 
their respective sources as to the incidents in Iraq, but no 
information has surfaced that would indicate any 
anti-American sentiment.  This is not to say that the host 
nation would not voice its opinion on the incidents.  Past 
incidents have shown that, when pressured by its Arab League 
brethren, the Government of Djibouti will take an opposing 
stance on certain American Foreign policies so as not to lose 
face with the public.

SUBJECT: USG QUICK RESPONSE IN FLOOD AFFECTED  AREAS OF 
DJIBOUTI 
 
1. (U) On the early morning of 13 April, following 
high tides, strong winds and torrential rains in 
almost all districts of Djibouti, the river El Oued 
suddenly burst its banks and flooded several areas 
in Djibouti City affecting over 80 percent of its 
inhabitants.  Water rose over seven feet in many 
neighborhoods, washing away people and belongings. 
Fifty-nine bodies were eventually found and sent to 
the city mortuary, however, it is estimated that 
around 300 people died in this disaster.  Others are 
still missing and unaccounted for. 
 
2. (U) Many houses in the affected areas were destroyed 
causing displacement of several thousands of people who 
sought refuge with relatives in other parts of the city. 
Djiboutian officials have indicated that approximately 
1,500 remain without shelter, although there is evidence 
that many more have not been registered.  These persons 
were relocated to either the military camp of Sheik 
Osman or Balbala 2 primary school in poor sanitary 
conditions and scarce means to make a living.  More 
than one third of the displaced are children. 
 
3. (U) The water and electricity infrastructure was also 
heavily damaged.  With the resulting drinking water 
shortage, broken sewage pipes and environmental damage 
from the flood, the threats of epidemic prone diseases 
such as cholera were pressing health emergency.  It is 
estimated that around 300,000 people were vulnerable to 
these outbreaks. 
 
4. (U) The flood situation also disrupted provision of 
basic health services because of the total or partial 
destruction of four main health care facilities in the 
area.  Medical equipment, drugs, cold chain and 
nutrition supplement stocks were lost.  These centers 
cover around 90,000 of the population.  In addition, 
two health care centers in the outskirts of the 
affected areas faced increased demands of the displaced 
population housed in neighboring schools.  There are 
plans to relocate the displaced to PK12, a neighborhood 
at the outskirts of Djibouti City.  Relocation 
conditions in terms of shelter, water, food and 
latrines are not yet well defined.  On the national 
level, French and American armies were mobilized to 
help save those stranded in trees and roof tops, 
collect dead bodies and animals from the city streets, 
pump standing water away from neighborhoods into the 
sea, repair washed away bridges and railway lines and 
provide potable water to those in need. 
 
5. (U) In the 1994 flood in Djibouti, a cholera outbreak 
of 8,000 cases and 32 deaths were registered.  Another 
cholera outbreak was recorded in 1997 with 3,000 cases. 
The current post-flood situation in Djibouti poses a 
genuine emergency.  The Minister of Health, Dr. Ali 
Kamil, and his health emergency cell, have developed a 
master plan for cholera outbreak.  Four health centers 
in the affected areas have been rehabilitated and water 
restored.  Health services are being provided to the 
needy.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) has also installed 
an emergency surveillance system for epidemic prone 
diseases, such as malaria and cholera, and strengthened 
preparedness for facing an eventual outbreak of cholera 
in the affected area.  The cholera prevention program 
includes regionally pre-positioning Emergency Health Kits. 
 
6. (U) USAID Representative Janet Schulman worked very 
closely with the Minister of Health, his health 
emergency unit, World Health Organization (WHO) 
Representative Jihane Tawilah and Office of Foreign 
Disaster Assistance (OFDA) advisor Mia Beers to order 
critically needed emergency drugs and equipment.  On 
April 28, WHO Geneva sent by charter plane 
approximately 48 tons of emergency diarrhea medication 
which were ordered for Djibouti\'s MOH.  With the arrival 
of these drugs and equipment, critical stocks lost in 
the centers will be restored to enable the MOH to 
respond to any cholera and typhoid outbreaks.  Some 
USAID funding is being used to support public 
information campaign needs on ways to make water safe 
at the household level using boiling and chlorination 
as well as safe food preparation.  Nonetheless, access 
to safe water remains a basic requirement to prevent 
cholera epidemics; more efforts need to be directed 
towards providing safe drinking water as well as water 
for food preparation and bathing. 
 
7. (U) USAID/OFDA provided resources for WHO to bring 
into Djibouti within two weeks of the disaster: 
- 10 New Emergency Health Kits (NEHK) to cover drugs 
and medical supplies for 10,000 people for 
approximately three months. 
- 40 kits each of WHO Kit D, containing drugs to treat 
100 people affected by diarroheal diseases, including 
cholera, and Kit F, containing medical supplies to 
supplement Kit D. 
-Laboratory Supply for water surveillance and cholera 
testing, plus additional needed medication and supplies. 
- Large water dispensers for administration of bulk Oral 
Rehydration Solution. 
- Public Health Supplies and equipment for cleaning and 
disinfection (cresol, muriatic acid, chlorine and 
others to be locally purchased). 
- Chlorination supplies for water at household level. 
- Support logistics for daily water and health 
facilities surveillance for diarrheal diseases in the 
next three months. 
- Support for the development of public health 
education material. 
 
8. (U) Total USAID support for this disaster is $300,000. 
The Minister of Health and his emergency health unit, 
Schulman, and Tawilah were at the airport on April 28 to 
receive the WHO shipment.  The Djiboutian Presidential 
Republican Guards were on hand to unload the medication 
and supplies and to truck them to the central pharmacy 
under the watchful eyes of two logisticians sent in with 
the drugs by WHO Geneva.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI: EXPLOSION IN THE CITY LIMITS 
 
Classified By: RSO Marc Ramos for reason 1.4 (b) AND (c) 
 
 1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On 26 April, 2004 an explosion took place 
in Quartier 4 (Q4) in the city of Djibouti.  One person was 
injured and taken to the hospital for treatment.  The 
National Police (PN) conducted an investigation and submitted 
their findings to RSO Djibouti.  Several details of the 
incident remain inconclusive, but RSO will continue to work 
with Host Nation counterparts to try and solidify the 
information. 
 
2. (C) On 26 April, 2004 (time unknown) the Chief 
Investigator of the PN, Commander Omar Houssein, was notified 
by the PN command center that an explosion occurred in a 
house located in Q4 near the Cheik Issa Mosque.  Cmdr 
Houssein immediately initiated an investigation. 
 
Upon arrival to the site, Cmdr Houssein instructed an 
ambulance to transport a female, (ethnicity unknown), to the 
Djiboutian central medical facility - Peltier Hospital.  The 
PN then proceeded to question and subsequently arrest eight 
individuals at the site, who were suspected of involvement in 
the incident. 
 
The PN collected several pieces of metal, which they believe 
are fragmented parts of the explosive device.  An assessment 
of the blast pattern was conducted and the PN came to the 
conclusion that the device was placed in the kitchen ceiling 
of the house.  Unfortunately, the PN does not have the 
material resources to effectively identify the type or size 
of device used. 
 
The PN states that as a result of interviews, Youssouf 
Mohamoud Said (an Ethiopian Oromo male) is the primary 
suspect in detonation of the device.  In addition, the PN 
believe that Said and his brother, Djamal Mahamoud Said, are 
probably the individuals responsible for either carrying out 
or coordinating bombings aboard the Djibouti/Ethiopian train 
in the past year.  Unfortunately, Djamal fled the scene and 
is nowhere to be found.  The PN is continuing their 
investigation and have promised to keep the RSO informed as 
to the development of the case. 
 
3. (S) RSO Notes:  RSO believes that much of this information 
was passed to him in an effort to gain support for the 
Djiboutian theory on the train bombings.  The Djiboutians 
theorize that the Ethiopian government is behind the 
explosions on the train and they have made several attempts 
to solicit support from the USG in the manner of financial 
resources to invigorate a failing transport system. 
Djiboutians are well aware of the passion that Americans have 
for countering terrorism and use key words such as bombs, 
terrorists and security to garner financial and material 
assistance at available opportunities.  RSO will continue to 
monitor the investigation, but remains skeptical of 
information provided by Djiboutian authorities. 
 
4. (SBU) On a positive note, reports from several sources 
indicated that the Djiboutian investigative team responded 
quickly to the scene of the crime and conducted their 
investigation in a methodical and professional manner. 
Bystanders were impressed with the type of evidence 
collection equipment used and the precise application of 
specialized tools to secure the site and determine the 
location of the device   This sort of response can only be 
attributed to the successful contribution put forth by the 
Anti Terrorism Assistance program.  The techniques applied 
and equipment used is directly linked to the Post Blast 
Investigation Course and the Terrorist Crime Scene 
investigation course.  These courses have been crucial in 
enhancing the very capabilities needed to respond to an 
incident at the Embassy and is the best dollar for dollar 
investment the USG has in countering terrorism in Djibouti. 
 
 
5. (S) RSO requests ITA, PII and Embassies Addis Ababa, 
Asmara, Nairobi, Khartoum and Sanaa conduct name checks on 
the following persons to correlate any potential terrorist 
associations: 
 
- Mohamed Said Dirir - Djiboutian National (Landlord) 
- Youssouf Mohamed Said, Ethiopian Oromo (prime suspect in

SUBJECT: SECURITY CONCERNS IN LIGHT OF ATTACKS IN SAUDI 
ARABIA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Marguerita D. Ragsdale for reasons 1.4 (b) an 
d (d). 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Ambassador met with Minister of 
Cooperation, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, May 3, to discuss 
Embassy concerns in light of the attack in Yanbu, 
Saudi Arabia, on May 1st.  Ambassador explained that 
the Embassy has assessed that its security posture 
should remain the same but raised concern about the 
potential for violent public reaction in Djibouti. 
Youssouf expressed the Government of Djibouti\'s shared 
concern in maintaining the peace and security of U.S. 
citizens in country.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador spoke with Minister of Cooperation, 
Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, on potential security 
concerns for the Embassy and American citizens in light 
of the terrorist attack in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, and 
recent televised reports of prisoner mistreatment in 
Iraq.  Ambassador was clear that security measures at 
the Embassy were deemed adequate and should remain the 
same, but the attack in Yanbu raised concern about 
the possibility of smaller scale attacks.  Ambassador 
said that because of publicly expressed concerns 
that the attack in Yanbu may have been a reaction to 
televised reports in the Arab world of mistreatment of 
Iraqi detainees, she wanted to ensure that everyone is 
on the same page in terms of support of security 
related measures.  Ambassador states that she was 
unsure if the attack in Yanbu is an indication of a 
new trend of attacks aimed at smaller Western targets, 
rather than a group, or an anomaly. 
 
3. (C) Youssouf responded that the government understood 
the concerns and stated, for example, that it was not 
in the common interest of Djibouti and the U.S. to 
encourage public demonstrations because of their tendency 
to get out of hand.  He explained that in Djibouti City all 
of the vital government targets are located so close 
together that if something was triggered at one site, all 
would be in danger.  He agreed that security is a concern 
in light of the Yanbu incident and reports of prisoner 
mistreatment.  Youssouf said that while popular upheaval 
of this kind may be possible in other locations, 
Djiboutians have not had a history of such expressive 
feelings.  He commented that there was indeed a feeling of 
dismay and sympathy but the culture of Djibouti is more 
reflective and less spontaneous in their reactions. 
 
4. (C) Youssouf continued that he had just been at the 
National Assembly answering questions about the benefit 
Djibouti derives from the American presence.  It is 
important, he said, to remind the Djiboutian people of 
this.  He said the American image in Djibouti is quite 
good and that the government is engaged in a campaign 
to promote the good that the Americans have done.  The 
Government hopes that it will show the American interest 
in Djibouti as that of a friend and not possessing 
hegemonic intentions.  Youssouf indicated, however, his 
view that the more Iraq stabilizes, the less likely events 
such as Yanbu will occur.  He continued that stability 
needed to come as quickly as possible to Iraq.

1. (U) Ambassador delivered to Minister of Cooperation, 
Mahamoud Ali Youssouf on 3 May, the demarche requested 
reftel on the UN resolution for negotiation of a 
convention that would ban all cloning of human embryos. 
Ambassador explained to Youssouf that in 2003 the Sixth 
Committee of the UN considered a resolution put forward 
by Costa Rica for a comprehensive ban on human cloning, 
as well as a resolution proposed by Belgium for a 
partial ban.  The Committee had tabled the discussion 
until 2004. 
 
2. (U) She told Youssouf that Costa Rica has once again 
submitted their resolution for consideration.  The Costa 
Rican resolution is already being co-sponsored by the 
U.S. and 33 other nations.  Ambassador asked for 
Djibouti\'s co-sponsorship of the 2004 Costa Rican 
resolution. 
 
3. (U) Youssouf did not indicate if Djibouti would 
co-sponsor, but said his government would support the 
Costa Rican resolution for one reason only: cloning is 
morally against the laws of Islam.  He continued that 
this position has also been advocated by Al-Azhar in 
Egypt, which states that cloning is against the Islamic 
religion.  Youssouf sad he expected that this would also 
be the Arab League position.

COUNTER-TERRORISM SUPPORT 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (S) Ambassador, accompanied by RAO, paid a courtesy call 
on Hassan Said Khaireh, Chief of National Security Services, 
and his Deputy, Abdillahi Mohamed Abdillahi, on May 4 at the 
Presidency.  She began the meeting by thanking the two for 
their support in the global war on terrorism. She stressed 
the importance of continuing U.S.-Djibouti cooperation in 
this area, and praised the warm relations her two 
interlocutors had with RAO.  Hassan Said thanked the 
Ambassador and recalled the events of September 11 and their 
role in enhancing this cooperation. He pledged that the 
relations Ambassador described would continue. 
 
2. (C) Said noted ongoing efforts of his government to 
protect its borders and appreciated training opportunities 
offered through the U.S. Anti-terrorism Assistance (ATA) 
program. He expressed special concern, however, about the 
nation\'s ability to guard against smuggling via air routes, 
especially flights originating from Hargeisa in Somaliland 
and from Mogadishu.  Said stated that the weak area was in 
the large volume of baggage coming into Djibouti on these 
flights and insufficient capacity to inspect them.  He said 
he believed x-ray equipment could assist in this area.  He 
explained that none of the flights which come into Djibouti 
or depart from Djibouti have adequate procedures for baggage 
examination.  An x-ray exists for checking of large bags on 
arrival at the airport and a second x-ray for hand luggage 
once well inside the terminal building and just prior to 
movement to airport gates.  He stated that another was needed 
to provide a closer look at luggage and other items arriving 
into Djibouti, especially from Somaliland and Somalia. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador said she would look into the need he 
described and get back to him on whether assistance in this 
realm is possible.  She told Said that she was aware that 
additional funds had been allocated to Djibouti for a Safe 
Skies program and believed that the program may include 
airborne safety aspects as well as ground safety aspects. 
Perhaps, she said, there may be a way to fold in to the Safe 
Skies program the equipment he described. There will be 
further opportunities to discuss the Safe Skies program, 
Ambassador said, when Abdillahi attends the Department of 
Transportation and Transportation Security Administration 
conference September 22-24 in Johannesburg as part of 
Djibouti\'s delegation. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador expressed appreciation for the 
contributions Djibouti made to the dialogue at the recent 
EACTI conference in Kampala and said that she understood 
Djibouti had been a \"star\" at the conference.  Abdillahi who 
had been one of Djibouti\'s four representatives there, 
expressed pleasure at this perception and said he found the 
conference very useful.  He stated that Djibouti had a more 
critical role to play because of its direct involvement in 
many of the issues brought out in the conference.  Ethiopia, 
for example, was more narrowly focused on insurgency groups 
such as the OLF vice true terrorist organizations. 
 
5. (C) Abdillahi took the opportunity of the Ambassador\'s 
call to raise the disposition of the vacant building across 
the street from the Embassy.  The building had been largely 
emptied by Security Services after September 2001, in support 
of security measures for Embassy Djibouti.  Djibouti\'s 
government had asked the Embassy on earlier occasions if the 
U.S. would be interested in purchasing the building. 
Ambassador told Abdillahi that she would be pleased to raise 
the building\'s disposition with Washington, but that she 
would first require a specific proposal from the Government 
of Djibouti.  If the proposal is for sale of the building, 
for example, it should include price and other particulars. 
She noted her concerns, however, about the condition of the 
building and the potential problem posed by the building 
having several owners.  Hassan Said and Abdillahi responded 
that the Minister of Finance was working on such a proposal.

Classified By: Ambassador Marguerita Ragsdale. Reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
 1. (C) Summary:  Members of Djibouti\'s delegation to the 
April 22-23 East Africa Counter-Terrorist Initiative 
EACTI) Conference in Kampala relayed their observations 
of the event to Embassy officers.  The delegates found the 
conference a useful forum to express Djibouti\'s total 
commitment to the Global War on Terrorism and said they 
have a clearer idea of the threat of transnational 
terrorism than most neighboring countries, especially 
Ethiopia.  They expressed continued frustration at the 
delay in delivery of EACTI assistance, particularly 
speedboats for coastal defense.  They conceded that 
Djibouti had done a poor job of prioritizing training 
needs.  They indicated their belief that for success in 
counter-terrorism in the Horn of Africa, the U.S. should 
commit itself more forcefully in efforts to reintegrate 
Somalia into the East African community of nations. 
End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) From April 22 through April 23, 2004, delegates 
from eight East African countries and numerous branches 
of the U.S. government, met in Kampala, Uganda, to discuss 
EACTI issues.  Djibouti was represented by Abdillahi 
Mohamed Abdillahi, Deputy Chief of National Security 
Services; Lieutenant Colonel Osman Nour Soubagleh, 
Djibouti\'s liaison to the U.S. military; Mohamed Ali 
Hassan, Director of Bilateral Relations, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Mohamed Moussa Abar, 
Captain (Harbormaster) of the port of Djibouti; and 
Bryan Boyd, Force Protection Officer, American Embassy 
Djibouti. 
 
3. (C) Following the conference, the Djiboutian delegates 
met with Embassy officers to provide their reaction to the 
conference.  The delegates stated that the conference was 
a good initiative and very productive in bringing 
the East African countries together to discuss 
counter-terrorist issues with representatives from the U.S. 
government, particularly those from the U.S. State 
Department who are responsible for EACTI funding. They 
said they sincerely want the U.S. government to recognize 
that Djibouti is committed to fighting the Global War on 
Terrorism.  They also commented that their involvement 
in the conference, including participation in the 
discussions and presentations in two of the four 
breakout groups\' final reports to the plenary, are good 
examples of Djibouti\'s level of dedication. Abdillahi 
represented the group on \"Law and Law Enforcement\" 
while Hassan represented the group on \"Integration 
and Regional Cooperation.\" 
 
4. (C) The delegates shared with FPO officer their belief 
in the need to accelerate the initiative in Djibouti. 
They cited lack of delivery to date of engineering 
construction equipment and five patrol boats that are 
part of EACTI funding and requested an update on delivery 
status. The delegates however, were very pleased with 
progress of the TIP/PISCES program in Djibouti.  They said 
the Global War on Terrorism is unlike any other war in 
history and the need to move swiftly to fortify Djibouti 
is critical to its success.  They also stated that there 
is a need for the U.S. government to institute new 
procedures to combat terrorism more swiftly and that many 
of the procedures used by the U.S. government today 
were originally initiated during the cold war. 
 
5. (C) The delegates also admitted shortcomings in 
their own government, particularly in providing clear 
guidance and a timely response to requests by U.S. 
representatives on ways EACTI funding should be 
utilized in Djibouti.  The delegates stated that it is 
their goal to ensure that a list of well-conceived 
requests is prepared and an open dialogue is maintained 
to assist the U.S. government on properly allocating 
EACTI funding. 
 
6. (C) One delegate commented that he appreciated the 
frankness of American participants at the conference and 
believed that many of the comments made were crucial and 
important to the conference, particularly to his 
understanding of foreign policy issues and how EACTI 
works in other countries.  This delegate was particularly 
impressed by comments made from the U.S. representatives 
from Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
7. (C) The delegates concluded their overall summary of 
the conference by commenting on Somalia.  They said there 
is a great need for all participants, and especially the 
U.S., to devise a strategy to stabilize Somalia. They went 
on to say that it was extremely important that the U.S. 
spearhead peace efforts in Somalia, and that the U.S. 
should not run from the issue.  The delegates said 
Somalia is the largest safe haven for terrorists in 
East Africa and failure to deal with Somalia ultimately 
weakens the long-term anti-terrorist efforts of the 
U.S. and East African countries. 
 
8. (C) One delegate also commented that Somalia\'s seacoast 
covers over 3,000 km and reaches from Djibouti all the way 
to Kenya providing the greatest external border threat 
to other countries. Something needs to be done, they said, 
to address this vulnerability. They also wanted to 
emphasize that the issues of controlling the internal 
borders in various East African countries are more 
political than security-oriented. Greater efforts should 
be placed on controlling the airport, seaport, 
and seacoast. (Note: Comments about internal border 
security stemmed from a series of discussions at the 
conference that stressed the need for a national I.D. 
card to track movement of people. End Note.) He continued 
that borders between countries are not the overlying 
problem and many of the people in East Africa routinely 
cross from one country to the next daily. The 
delegates indicated that proper control of the movement 
of people between internal borders can be achieved by 
building structures such as wells and schools that will 
attract migrant and nomadic people to settle in a 
particular area.

SUBJECT: MAY DAY EVENTS POTENTIAL SIGN OF IMPROVEMENT IN 
DJIBOUTIAN LABOR RELATIONS 
 
REF: (A) DJIBOUTI 530 (B) DJIBOUTI 460 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) May Day celebrations in Djibouti City may be a 
sign that the Government is changing its position on 
labor relations between the Government and the 
legitimate national labor union.  Both the Union 
Djiboutienne de Travailluers (UDT) and the government 
created Union General Travailluers de Djiboutienne 
(UGTD) held rallies on 1 May to celebrate the Djiboutian 
Labor Day.  The significant event of this year\'s 
celebrations was the funding given by the Government of 
Djibouti to both unions to organize their rallies.  UGTD 
was given 1,000,000DF (approximately $5,600) and UDT was 
given 500,000DF (approximately $2,800).  Both rallies also 
received coverage on the local television news, though 
UDT received less time.  UGTD\'s rally was covered by a 
half-page column in La Nation, the government run 
newspaper, which ended by saying coverage of the UDT 
rally would follow in next editions. 
 
2. (C) Pol/Econ\'s conversations with UDT Secretary, 
Souleiman Djama and UDT Secretary General, Aden Mohamed 
Abdou, indicated that this gesture may be an improvement 
for the moment, but not for the long term.  Djama 
speculated that the Government\'s actions concerning Labor 
Day may be merely a play towards voters in preparation for 
the Presidential election next year or perhaps a show of 
positive steps in response to continued pressure from the 
international community to improve labor practices.  He 
continues that it was an improvement, but the motivations 
behind it were not certain.  Abdou was of a slightly 
different school of thought, saying that this gesture may 
have been a real step towards opening negotiations to 
recognize the legitimately elected UDT.  He also speculated 
that it may be a tactic to test the members of the UDT 
and to try to pull some to the government\'s side. 
Nevertheless, he said, this was a positive step.  The 
question was how long it would last. 
 
3. (C) Post believes that both Abdou and Djama\'s view 
on the apparent improvements have merit.  Reflecting on 
the long history of discord between the Guelleh 
administration and UDT, this sudden change in attitude 
seems to hide ulterior motives.  Time can only tell 
whether Guelleh\'s potential improvement turns out to be 
a genuine gesture of reconciliation.

1.  (U) On May 3, Ambassador raised with Mahmoud Ali Youssef, 
Minister of Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
the outstanding U.S. offer to purchase a site for a new 
embassy compound (NEC) in Djibouti.  Youssef, at that time, 
said he had did not yet have a response to the U.S. offer, 
although he had been prodding his government since it 
received our diplomatic note three weeks earlier on April 11. 
Youssef did ask, however, if the U.S. were certain that the 
land it wished to purchase had not been claimed by another 
buyer. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador responded that the U.S. team that put 
together our survey and offer was aware that part of the 
parcel of land it originally considered for purchase was no 
longer available.  Nevertheless, the team found the remaining 
area of the original parcel acceptable for USG needs and the 
offer of USD 1,800,000 put forward in Embassy\'s diplomatic 
note covered that portion of the remaining space available in 
the parcel. 
 
3. (C) In a follow-up phone call from Youssef to Ambassador 
on May 6, Youssef stated that  contrary to President 
Guelleh\'s remark (reported reftel A) that the Government of 
Djibouti would make a counter-proposal on price of the 
parcel, there would now not repeat not be a counter-proposal. 
 The amount the U.S. had offered, Youssef said, was 
acceptable. 
 
4.  (U) Youssef continued that since the price was 
acceptable, the matter of working out modalities -- so that a 
diplomatic note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
accepting the offer and laying out technical specifications 
could be finalized-- had been turned over to the Minister of 
Habitat, Urbanism, Environment and Planning, Abdallah 
Abdillahi Miguil.  Youssef told Ambassador that an 
appointment for her with Miguil had already been set for the 
following week. 
 
5. (SBU) Ambassador is scheduled to meet with Miguil on 
Monday, May 17, and will advise Department of outcome and 
remaining issues.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (SBU) This is an action message. 
 
2. (SBU)  Minister of Interior and Decentralization, 
Abdulkader Dualeh Wais, convoked Ambassador to the Ministry 
on May 8 to request additional USG financial assistance for 
Djibouti\'s upcoming regional elections.  Reftels reported an 
outstanding request from Wais for USD 500,000 for printing, 
computer networks, informational material, vehicles, repair 
of voter card distribution offices and an Independent 
Electoral Commission in support of these elections.  Embassy 
awaits Department\'s response to these earlier reftels. 
 
3. (SBU) In the May 8 meeting, Wais told Ambassador that 
regional elections were now planned for November, 2004 vice 
October.  He said that after elections are over, and a formal 
installation of officers, those elected must be given 
furnished offices out of which to operate and vehicles to 
reach constituents in their districts.  The total number of 
regional officers, he said, would equal 13:  one each from 
the districts of Obock, Dikhil, Tadjoura, Ali Sabieh, Arta 
and Djibouti.  In addition, in Djibouti there will be a 
\"Conseil\" or Director, for each of the \"arrondissements,\" or 
districts of Djibouti, and another individual to serve as 
overall advisor. 
 
4. (SBU) Wais acknowledged in the meeting that overall 
assistance has also been requested from France and the EU for 
these elections. 
 
5. (C) Comment:  Ambassador made no promises to Wais and it 
is unclear what money can be obligated in this fiscal year, 
or in FY 2005, for these elections.  Whatever the Department 
decides to provide, however, will require oversight and 
management to avoid opportunities for diversion of resources. 
 We can work with USAID to consider possible mechanisms 
through which to channel this assistance.  Financial support 
provided by the U.S. for Djibouti\'s legislative elections in 
2003 were managed by the Embassy\'s first-tour consular 
officer.  We do not believe this would be an effective or 
appropriate option for the mission with any funding for 
November\'s regional elections. 
 
6. (C) It is also unclear what France or the EU will provide 
Djibouti, if any amount, in this instance, although the EU 
representative stated that approval of the purchase of 4 x 4 
vehicles would be difficult.  Embassy recommends that 
whatever is provided be provided in coordination with other 
donors.  End comment.

SUBJECT: EXXON-MOBIL NOTIFIED OF TERMINAL CLOSURE AND LEAD 
ROLE FOR ENOC\'S HORIZON LTD. 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) Summary:  Exxon-Mobil has received notification that 
it must terminate its operations at the existing port 
effective May 2005 and relocate to the new Doraleh port. 
Storage tanks would be available at the new port for either 
rent or a possible shareholding arrangement with Horizon 
Terminals Ltd. of Dubai, which would manage the new oil 
terminal.  Exxon-Mobil\'s representative in Djibouti shared 
with Ambassador his angst over the notification and will be 
consulting with offices in Addis Ababa and in Fairfax to 
decide on next steps.  A number of issues remain unresolved, 
including compensation -- if any -- to the company for loss 
of its existing facility.  Ethiopia may have interest in a 
stake in Doraleh, but this would not appear to be welcome 
news for Doraleh shareholders. End summary. 
 
2. (C)In a meeting with Ambassador and DCM at the 
Ambassador\'s residence May 15, Alain Adam, Director General 
of Exxon-Mobil operations in Djibouti (Mobil),  shared two 
letters his company had received on the future of Mobil\'s oil 
storage facilities at the existing port of Djibouti.  The 
first, dated 10 May 2004 from Abdurahman Boreh, in Boreh\'s 
capacity as Chairman of Djibouti Ports and Free Zones 
Authority, gave \"official notice\" that Mobil\'s existing oil 
terminal at Djibouti\'s port would be closed effective May 
2005.  The letter went on to state that the move had become 
necessary for security and environmental reasons, that this 
was a \"final notice,\" and that services after the closure 
\"will be provided by the new oil terminal at Doraleh Port.\" 
(Note: Boreh, who is close to President Guelleh, is a 
prominent Djiboutian businessman with a 40 per cent stake in 
Doraleh port. Construction of Doraleh port is being managed 
by Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), and its shipping and 
terminalling subsidiary Horizon Terminals Ltd. (Horizon) will 
control the oil terminal. End note) 
 
3. (C) The second letter, from Elmi Obsieh Waiss, Minister of 
Equipment and Transport, was also dated 10 May.  It, too, 
confirmed the changeover date of May 2005 and the decision of 
the government of Djibouti to relocate petroleum activities 
to the new port at Doraleh. Waiss\'s letter asked Mobil to 
\"take all arrangements necessary to conform to this new 
organization.\"  Total and Shell directors in Djibouti, 
according to Adam, received the same letters. 
 
4. (C) Adam complained that the letters made no mention of 
how Mobil, Shell or Total would be compensated for their 
facilities at the existing port or what would happen to 
current employees working for the companies in Djibouti. He 
said he would be meeting with Waiss for further explanation 
and would follow that meeting with consultations in Addis 
Ababa with Mobil offices there and with Fairfax headquarters. 
 
5. (C)  Ambassador told Adam she would speak to Boreh 
directly to find out more details about the content and 
implications of the letters, and reached him by telephone in 
Dubai.  In an extended conversation, Boreh stated that for 
the past three years the Government of Djibouti had been 
telling Mobil that its terminal facility at the existing port 
must be moved because of pollution caused by leakage from 
containers belonging to the oil companies.  He said Mobil had 
also been told of the intention of the Government to build a 
new oil terminal facility at Doraleh, and indeed, had been 
invited to invest in the project.  \"Mobil expressed no 
interest in investing in this new facility,\" Boreh said. 
\"None of the oil companies expressed interest, except Total 
initially. They thought we were bluffing and that we would 
never build such a facility.  Well they were wrong,\" he said. 
 
6. (C) Boreh added that the shift in terminals is occurring 
primarily because of the leakage of oil from the existing 
aging tanks. It was important for Mobil and the others to 
understand, he said, that there is no plan to create a 
monopoly in oil services and facilities in Djibouti.  Horizon 
will not do trading in oil.  It will only do storage in 
Djibouti and Mobil and other oil companies will be obliged to 
rent storage tanks from Horizon.  It is not in Djibouti\'s 
interest, he continued, to have such a monopoly.  \"We are not 
here to close down the business of Mobil, but merely to 
upgrade operations.\"  Boreh told Ambassador that the cost of 
renting storage from Horizon is an issue that can be 
discussed as well as the possibility of shareholding in the 
same storage facilities.  He said he expected overall cost of 
operations for the oil companies to decline with the reduced 
labor force requirement resulting from the shift. Ambassador 
subsequently conveyed to Adam the content of her conversation 
with Boreh. 
 
7. (C) In a follow-up, Adam informed Ambassador that he, 
along with Total and Shell representatives, met with Waiss on 
May 18.  It was a short meeting.  In a nutshell, Adam said, 
Waiss told the group of the need to move their operations 
because of pollution over the preceding years, including 
damage to the existing port facilities. (Note:  Adam 
acknowledges pollution, but said Mobil has been engaged in 
vigorous clean-up operations at the port.  End note)   Adam 
said he asked Waiss what the Government of Djibouti intended 
to do about employees who would lose their jobs at the 
current facilities and who were already circulating Waiss\'s 
letter. Adam said Waiss had replied that if his letter was 
being circulated, it is because the oil companies had 
released it, not the Government of Djibouti. In any case, 
Djiboutian employees are \"our problem, not yours,\" Waiss 
reportedly told the group. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  Adam has made no effort to hide his angst 
over the demand broached by Boreh and the government but has 
perhaps been less aggressive in efforts to learn more about 
the Doraleh project (currently well underway as septel 
reports) or to figure creative ways Mobil might profit from 
the proposed new arrangement. This might call his 
effectiveness into question. We believe the Government is 
serious about its intent to close the existing terminal and 
were told the new facility is scheduled to come on line in 
May 2005.  We do not believe, however, that the Government 
has considered the issue of compensation for this American 
company or for others affected.  Boreh told Ambassador that a 
consultant will look at the matter of what happens to both 
the land under the existing terminal facility and the 
compensation issue and make recommendations to the Government 
of Djibouti.  Meanwhile, Adam is enroute to Addis Ababa and 
expects to have shortly views of his organization on 
recommended and preferred next steps here in Djibouti. 
Embassy is ready to assist, in consultation with Mobil. 
 
9. (C) Comment continued for Embassy Addis Ababa:  According 
to Boreh, Ethiopia has asked for a stake in the Doraleh 
facility, but it is unclear how it would finance 
participation.  Boreh was less than enthusiastic, we might 
add, about such a partnership, even if it were possible.  He 
said the Ethiopians are far too difficult people with whom to 
work.  End comment.

2. (U)  Following the announcement ending most commercial 
sanctions against Libya, the Banque Indosuez Mer Rouge 
branch located in Djibouti sent Embassy Djibouti a letter 
requesting assistance, on behalf of SVAMC SARL DJIBOUTI, 
in recovering assets frozen by Citibank New York under ILSA. 
The assets frozen were $74,000 USD in payment for the 
purchase by the Libyan Embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 
of four Suzuki vehicles from SVAMC SARL DJIBOUTI.  Embassy 
requests Department\'s assistance in resolving this 
long-standing issue. 
 
3. (U) Following is a brief outline of key dates in the 
SVAMC SARL DJIBOUTI case: 
--September 18, 2001: Libyan Embassy in Ethiopia 
purchases four Suzuki vehicles from SVAMC SARL DJIBOUTI 
for a total of $74,000 USD. 
--November 19, 2001: Gianni Rizzo, owner of SVAMC SARL, asks 
Banque Indosuez Mer Rouge (BCIMR) to inquire into the delay 
in payment for the Suzuki purchase. 
--December 4, 2001: Commercial Bank of Ethiopia informs BCIMR 
that the request was made to transfer funds to the SVAMC SARL 
account at Citibank New York, however the funds transfer had 
been blocked due to sanctions against Libya. 
--March 5, 2002: BCIMR requests Embassy assistance in 
resolving the issue of blocked funds. 
--March 6, 2002: SVAMC SARL DJIBOUTI files application to 
OFAC for a release of funds. 
--May 6, 2002: Department of Treasury sends notification of 
receipt of SVAMC SARL\'s request to release funds. 
--May 20, 2002: BCIMR requests Embassy assistance a second 
time to intervene due to SVAMC SARL\'s decision to bring the 
matter to the Djiboutian Courts. (It is unclear what, if any, 
Embassy action was taken at that time.) 
--May 3, 2004: BCIMR again requests Embassy\'s assistance in 
unblocking funds transfer for the SVAMC SARL transaction. 
 
4. (U) Embassy has made available in its consular section

SUBJECT: REPORT OF CRASH IN DJIBOUTI OF U.S. UNMANNED 
AERIAL VEHICLE 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (S) Commanding General of French Forces in Djibouti, 
Gerard Pons, told me during my regular weekly meeting with 
him on May 19 that he had been informed three days earlier, 
through a private Djiboutian citizen, of the crash in 
Djibouti \"last week\" of a U.S. small unmanned aerial vehicle 
(UAV).  The crash occurred, according to Pons, close to the 
town of Damerdjog, located between Djibouti\'s international 
airport and the town of Loyada near the Somali border.  Pons 
expressed displeasure that the flight had occurred without 
his having been informed of it.  He said that while he does 
not ask the U.S. about the purpose of its UAVs, he does ask 
that the U.S. extend the courtesy of at least informing of an 
intent to conduct such an operation.  He stated that flying a 
UAV of this type, near an international airport used by the 
French military, without advance notice, could be especially 
dangerous for helicopters. I and USLO Chief, who accompanied 
me in the meeting, reassured General Pons that we were not 
aware of any U.S. UAVs being operated in Djibouti, but 
promised to look immediately into the matter. 
 
2. (S) USLO Chief conducted an initial investigation just 
after with Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) 
personnel at Camp Lemonier.  He was told that JSOTF had 
indeed operated a UAV, that it was carrying a camera device, 
and that it had crashed.  At this time it is still unknown 
where the crash occurred. The incident had taken place, JSOTF 
stated, about a week prior. (Note: Further inquiries with 
JSOTF revealed that the operation may actually have occurred 
in April.  We cannot at this point confirm.)  According to 
information provided by JSOTF, debris from the UAV was 
subsequently retrieved by private Djiboutian nationals from 
the village of Damerdjog, who then approached the Camp 
offering to return the debris. (Note: It is unclear how the 
nationals identified the UAV as originating from the Camp. 
End note) It is understood that JSOTF paid a sum of money to 
the Djiboutian nationals for the debris.  We also understand 
that JSOTF is doing (or has already done) its own internal 
investigation to determine who may have launched the UAV and 
other material information associated with this incident. We 
have a secondary report that the UAV flight was a test run 
that failed. 
 
3. (S) COMMENT:  I am deeply concerned that a UAV operation 
-- test or otherwise -- was launched in Djibouti without 
advance notice to me or appropriate members of my Country 
Team, to the Government of Djibouti, or to the Commanding 
General of French Forces, whose units operate in the vicinity 
of Djibouti\'s civilian airport and the border with Somalia. 
 I have requested a meeting with the JSOTF Commander at Camp 
Lemonier for further details and will also raise this with 
General Robeson, the CJTF-HOA Commander.  We are concerned, 
of course, about potential fallout from the Government of 
Djibouti, although it has not lodged a formal protest as of 
this date. That still may come as word gets out in this small 
community.  In addition, the lack of notice could very well 
have caused an incident involving aircraft operating in the 
region, for which the U.S. could very well have been held 
accountable. End Comment.

SUBJECT: FIRST NATIONAL FORUM ON HUMAN RIGHTS  BOYCOTTED BY 
OPPOSITION 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: The Government of Djibouti\'s Ad-Hoc 
Committee on Human Rights held the first ever national 
forum on Human Rights 17-18 May, 2004.  This forum was 
funded by a DHRF grant from Embassy Djibouti and by 
United Nations Development Program (UNDP).  The main 
goal of this forum was to open debate on Human Rights 
among the population of Djibouti.  Results were to be 
incorporated into new laws on Human Rights and guides 
for parliamentarians on creating laws with human rights 
in mind.  However, the forum was boycotted by opposition 
leaders, including the President of the Djiboutian 
League of Human Rights.  The Minister of Justice 
commented in his opening remarks that the opposition 
was invited but didn\'t deem it useful to make their 
opinions public.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) Under extreme security and by invitation only, 
the Government of Djibouti held its first ever National 
Forum on the Status of Human Rights 17-18 May, 2004 at 
the hall of the Union National des Femmes Djiboutienne 
(UNFD - National Union of Djiboutian Women). 
Participants were required to show their invitation, 
pass through metal detectors and leave all mobile phones 
at the door before entering.  Those that did not have an 
invitation or came late were turned away.  Reportedly, a 
few reporters from Radio Television Djibouti (RTD) were 
turned away by the Republican Guard, even though they had 
invitations.  While participants waited for the opening 
ceremony to begin, a popular musician played songs of 
social commentary.  The forum began upon the arrival of 
President Guelleh, who presided over the opening 
ceremonies along with the Minister of Justice, the 
President of the Supreme Court, and the Prime Minister. 
 
3. (C) The site of the forum was a point of contention 
with opposition groups, who said they preferred \"a 
neutral site.\"  The initial location was to be the 
Palais du Peuple, a civic center built by China, but 
the air conditioning has been broken for several months 
so the site was nixed.  The alternate site acceptable 
to the opposition was the Sheraton Hotel.  According to 
a press release from the Djiboutian League for Human 
Rights (LDDH) carried in the May 19th edition of Realite, 
an opposition party journal, this option was ruled out 
for financial reasons, despite requests for extra funds 
from the UNDP, one of the donor organizations funding 
the forum.  This, however, was not the main reason for 
the boycott by the opposition.  In a \"Lettre Ouverte\" 
published in the 17 March 2004 edition of Realite, the 
four main opposition groups declared they would not 
attend the upcoming forum on Human Rights.  They said 
the Government of Djibouti had not made steps to 
fulfill its promises of decentralization written in 
the 2001 peace accords and had committed several 
violations of human rights.  President of the LDDH, 
Jean Paul Noel, told Pol/Econ the opposition felt that 
it was not worth its participation when nothing had 
been done on any of the Government\'s earlier promises. 
 
4. (U) In his opening statement at the Forum, Minister 
of Justice Ismail Ibrahim Houmed claimed that the 
opposition had been informed of the dates of the Forum 
and had agreed, but three weeks later published an open 
letter saying they would not attend and were not in 
agreement.  Houmed went on to say that two days before 
the forum, he sent invitations once again to the 
leaders of the opposition, but they did not deem it 
useful to express their contradictions in public. 
Houmed commented in his opening remarks that this 
conference is held with an international context in 
mind, contrasting notably with situations in 
Palestinian territories, Iraq and Ivory Coast.  Houmed 
also remarked that the \"great powers\" of the world had 
taken no action in Palestine and Iraq.  He went on to 
say that \"after the toppling of the dictator in Iraq 
and the promise of a free and democratic country, human 
rights are being abused.  The Iraqi people have lost 
their basic rights as human beings.  In a world on fire, 
Djibouti is an island of peace.\"  Houmed highlighted 
that \"of the 350 prisoners in the one jail in Djibouti, 
none are political prisoners and there is no death 
penalty.\" 
 
5. (U) Media reaction to the Human Rights forum was 
strong and broad.  The 19 May edition of Realite carried 
a press release from the LDDH stating that the forum 
should have been postponed until the next judicial 
session, in order to give the Ministry of Justice the 
necessary time to fulfill necessary conditions for the 
best success and transparency of the forum.  Among these 
conditions were holding the forum at a neutral site and 
ensuring participation of international Human Rights 
organizations to act as observers and the participation 
of all politicians. The statement also demanded 
tangible and palpable elements in favor of total 
independence of the judiciary and a solemn declaration 
of the end of impunity, and abuses of power by the 
installation of completely independent judicial 
structures. 
 
6. (U) Also in Realite, a press release from the 
Association for the Defense of Human Rights and 
Freedoms (ADDHL) deplored the absence of the 
International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH), based 
in Paris, the Inter-African Union for Human Rights 
(UIDH), based in Ouagadougou, as well as the Djiboutian 
labor unions.  It further said that without the 
participation of the opposition parties, the forum had 
become an item of non-interest.  The ADDHL added that 
the status of Human Rights could not be objectively 
described without discussion and debate. 
 
7. (U) Le Renouveau Djiboutien, the opposition journal 
of Daher Ahmed Farah -- arrested several times in 2003 
for his publications -- called President Guelleh \"the 
Champion of Violations of Human Rights.\"  The article 
also called the event only a \"family affair\" citing the 
absence of opposition parties and of defenders of 
Human Rights. 
 
8. (U) La Liberte, opposition journal of the Front pour 
la Restauration de l\'Unite et de la Democratie (FRUD), 
said the opposition \"could not support this parody of 
democracy.\"  It went on to say that by participating, 
the opposition\'s presence would have supported a regime 
that denies all free speech and civil liberties. 
Liberte also called the invitations \"selective,\" 
indicating that the true spectrum of the Djiboutian 
population had not been represented. 
 
9. (C) COMMENT: Post believes that the objectives of 
this forum were a step in the right direction on the 
issue of Human Rights in Djibouti.  However, with the 
boycott of opposition political parties, the forum may 
not bring the effective change that is desired by many 
in the population.  The reasons for the stagnation of 
change and implementation of the peace accords may lie 
with the Government, but the silence of the opposition 
on this matter does not help and does not reflect a 
true understanding of the importance of participation 
in democratic processes, regardless of their 
sentiments about the existing government.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: ETHIOPIAN OFFICIALS HOLD TALKS WITH DJIBOUTI 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) Minister of Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA), Mahmoud Ali Youssef, told Ambassador May 20 
during their meeting at the MFA on another matter, that the 
May 18-19 visit of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to 
Djibouti had gone very well.  Meles had come to Djibouti to 
inaugurate what Youssef described as the Ethiopian 
Government\'s \"most expensive embassy complex in Africa.\" 
(Note: Ambassador had attended the inauguration which took 
place in Djibouti on May 18. End note). 
 
2. (C) While Meles also met privately with Guelleh during his 
visit, the visit was an opportunity as well for Djibouti to 
launch the first meeting in five years of the 
Ethiopia-Djibouti Ministerial Committee.  The Committee 
included  Ethiopia\'s Seyoum Mesfin, Foreign Minister, Girma 
Birru, Minister of Commerce and Industries, Getachew Belai, 
Minister of Finance, Haile Assegide, Minister of State for 
Infrastructure,  Mulegeta Alemseged, described as \"Minister 
in the Office of the Prime Minister,\" and their Djiboutian 
counterparts. Also participating from Ethiopia were the 
Director General of African Affairs at Ethiopia\'s Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, and the Ethiopian Ambassador to Djibouti, 
Shemsudin Ahmed Robleh. Meetings of the Ministerial Group 
were in progress on May 20 when Youssef broke away to meet 
with Ambassador. 
 
3. (C) In a quick brief, Youssef said the Ministerial Group 
talks were focused on three key areas, the first being 
Somalia.  Djibouti hoped \"to bring Ethiopia around\" in its 
thinking on the future of Somalia.  The focus is to encourage 
Ethiopia to undertake higher level engagement in the Somali 
peace process. 
 
4. (C) The second area of Ministerial discussion, Youssef 
said, is development of Djibouti\'s new Port of Doraleh, whose 
construction is being managed by Emirates National Oil 
Company.  Ethiopia wants not only to invest in the port but 
in the possible development as well of an oil pipeline that 
would run directly from the Port of Doraleh to a point in 
Ethiopia, perhaps Addis Ababa, according to Youssef.  (Note: 
Fahmi al-Hag, Investment Advisor to President Guelleh 
(protect), told Ambassador several weeks ago that the 
Independent Petroleum Group (SAK) Kuwait (IPG) is interested 
in construction of a \"white oil\" pipeline from Doraleh port 
to a discharging or distribution terminal in Addis Ababa.  A 
pipeline \"order of magnitude cost estimate\" completed two 
years ago for the project makes note of Ethiopia\'s interest. 
Petronas of Malaysia is also said to be interested in this 
project. End note). 
 
5. (C) A third area of interest for the two delegations, 
Youssef said, is the SEA-ME-WE 4 intercontinental cable 
network that Djibouti wants to participate in but lacks the 
necessary capital to join singularly. Ethiopia may be 
interested in linking up with Djibouti for access and 
discussions are taking place on best means to initiate that 
involvement, according to Youssef. 
 
6. (C) Youssef said Djibouti was quite pleased about the 
prospect of talks with Ethiopia at the ministerial level 
because too much time had passed since the last session five 
years ago.  He commented, however, that it is never easy to 
negotiate with Ethiopians, so the talks have not been easy. 
In the history of dealing with Ethiopia, the farther it is 
apart from Eritrea, he mused, the closer it wants to move 
toward Djibouti.  Djibouti benefits economically from the 
existing tensions between the two countries and while 
unfortunate in a way, he said, it is \"a fact of life.\" 
 
7. (C) Comment: Youssef gave every indication that Djibouti 
is keen to make the most of the current economic advantages 
it enjoys with Ethiopia.  Direct Ethiopian investment in 
Djibouti would strengthen ties to an extent that would be 
more difficult to end should the political climate in the 
region change -- especially between Ethiopia and Eritrea -- 
in the not-too-distant future.  End Comment.

2. (SBU)  Summary:  Alain Adam, Director General of 
Exxon-Mobil operations in Djibouti (Mobil), briefed 
the Ambassador and DCM on May 23 about his meeting 
with Exxon-Mobil\'s East and Southern Africa Cluster 
Manager John DiTullio last week.  Mobil 
Djibouti\'s immediate plans are to ask 
clarification from the Government of Djibouti 
(GoDj) on the May 10 letters giving foreign oil 
companies a year before shutting down terminal 
operations at the old port; to approach 
Abdurahman Boreh, 40 percent partner in the new port 
of Doraleh, on the possibility of participating in the 
oil terminal there; and to tally up present assets and 
obligations to allow the company to do a cost-benefit 
analysis of maintaining operations in Djibouti by 
moving them to Doraleh.  Adam remains concerned about 
the lack of specifics on the new facilities, and 
whether the GoDj will seriously address the problem 
of compensation for lost physical assets and the 
company\'s financial obligation to the more than 80 
employees who will lose their jobs when the present 
terminal stops operations. End Summary. 
 
3. (SBU) Alain Adam, Director General of 
Exxon-Mobil operations in Djibouti (Mobil), 
was pleased with his meetings in 
Addis Ababa last week with Exxon-Mobil\'s 
East and Southern Africa Cluster 
Manager John DiTullio and that there had 
been a clear signal on how to proceed. 
He mentioned that the GoDj was continuing its 
negotiations with the Ethiopian government 
on supplying petroleum products.  Adam thought 
these meetings were not proceeding smoothly, 
and had been surprised when the Ethiopian 
Petroleum company (EPE) extended its contract 
with Mobil from December 31, 2004 through 
June 2005. 
 
4. (SBU)  Adam seemed particularly pleased that he 
had been authorized to deal directly with Abdurahman 
Boreh, 40 percent shareholder in Doraleh ports, 
on the possibility of moving operations there.  He 
hopes to see Boreh on May 28 or 29, if possible with 
Shell General Manager Jean Pierre Wyns, and Total 
representative Francois de Charnasse. (Note: Shell 
and Mobil have firm plans to conclude a joint venture 
to merge operations in Djibouti within the year. Total 
has recently joined these negotiations and may bring 
its operations into the joint venture, as well. End 
Note.) Adam said he wanted to clear up any 
misperception that Mobil was somehow opposed to 
the Doraleh project. 
 
5. (SBU) The May 10 letters from Boreh and the 
Minister of Transport will require considerable 
follow up. Initial plans are to write a letter to 
the Minister of Transport to obtain maximum details 
on the Doraleh port and the consequences of closure 
of operations at the existing port.  The letter will 
be vetted through Exxon-Mobil legal offices in 
Brussels in consultations with local attorney 
Alain Martinet. In the interim, Mobil will evaluate 
all its assets in Djibouti, including tanks, land, 
and the cost of a severance package to existing 
employees.  Exxon-Mobil will not accept, he said, 
any offset of its existing properties for clean-up 
costs the Government of Djibouti may seek to levy. 
\"The court case against Mobil for pollution is a 
different matter from being forced out of the 
country,\" Adam said. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: Adam seems better focused on how to 
proceed in resolving Mobil\'s principal problem with 
the Government of Djibouti. Unclear, specifically, are 
costs and conditions for using the Emirate National 
Oil Company (ENOC) facilities in Doraleh, and whether 
ENOC has obtained a contract for refueling U.S. 
naval vessels.  However, Adam now has a game plan. 
In the meantime, we will continue to consult with Mobil 
on this and other issues.  These include Government of 
Djibouti charges of Mobil polluting the harbor, and 
Mobil\'s difficulties with corrupt judges.  End comment.

SUBJECT: CJTF HOA COMMANDER\'S FAREWELL CALL ON PRESIDENT 
GUELLEH 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  For President Ismail Omar Guelleh, 
Djibouti\'s participation in the Global War on Terrorism is 
\"an honor.\"   He wants an end to conflict and hostility in 
the Horn of Africa region and is working directly with the 
President of the African Union to bring about a face to face 
meeting between Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and 
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.  During the farewell call 
by General Mastin Robeson, Commander of the Combined Joint 
Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTF HOA) based at Camp Lemonier 
in Djibouti, Guelleh said he hoped Ethiopia would take the 
first step.  Guelleh also welcomed General Robeson\'s informal 
proposal for billeting and training of Ugandan, Kenyan and 
perhaps other platoons, at Camp Lemonier.  He told Robeson 
that such acts can help facilitate an  improved political 
climate in the region.  Guelleh hailed Robeson as a \"pioneer\" 
who had taken responsibility as Commander of CJTF HOA and 
created a good working environment for relations between very 
different peoples.  Guelleh expects to attend the May 22-23 
Tunis Arab League Summit and said the situation in the 
Israeli-occupied territories should top the summit\'s agenda. 
End summary. 
 
2. (U) General Mastin Robeson, Commander of the Combined 
Joint Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTF HOA) based at Camp 
Lemonier in Djibouti, paid a farewell call May 20 on 
Djibouti\'s President Ismail Omar Guelleh.  General Robeson 
was accompanied in the call by CJTF HOA incoming commander, 
General Samuel Helland, by Ambassador, and by CJTF HOA 
political advisor Lange Schermerhorn.  Hassan Said Khaireh, 
Director of National Security Services  also sat in on the 
meeting. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Djibouti and Global War on Terrorism 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Robeson praised Guelleh as the strongest friend of the 
U.S. in the Horn of Africa region and attributed his own 
success over the past year to Guelleh\'s personal support.  He 
thanked Guelleh as well for the cooperation of Djibouti\'s 
military leadership, specifically General Fathi Ahmed 
Hussein, Major General of Djiboutian Armed Forces and General 
Zakaria Ibrahim Cheik, Major General for Djiboutian Defense, 
and for the opportunity given to CJTF HOA to partner with 
them in recent flood relief efforts.  Robeson also spoke of 
the strong relations that have existed between him and French 
forces, especially with their commander, General Gerard Pons. 
 Camp Lemonier, Robeson continued, was the most visible sign 
of friendship between the U.S. and Djibouti.  \"You never said 
no and you have taken care of us,\" Robeson added.  He also 
noted that plans are being developed in Washington to expand 
Camp Lemonier.  Guelleh responded that it was an honor for 
Djibouti to have contributed to the war against terrorism and 
to fighting what he described as \"these criminal gangsters, 
especially in this region.\"  He said he had not yet seen the 
plan for expansion of the Camp, but would like to and would 
study it. 
 
------------------------- 
Ethiopia-Eritrea Conflict 
------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Robeson raised with Guelleh his just-concluded 
farewell trip in the Horn of Africa.  He said he had met with 
President Isaias in Eritrea and with Prime Minister Meles in 
Ethiopia.  Guelleh asked Robeson for his views on why Isaias 
refused to see General Abizaid during the latter\'s recent 
swing through the region.  Robeson responded that Isaias had 
described the event as a misunderstanding.  He added that 
Isaias does appear to demonstrate concern about the growing 
hostility between Eritrea and Ethiopia.  However, Robeson 
said, the two men are quite different. 
 
5. (C) Guelleh acknowledged the tension between the two 
states and supported the view that the conflict involves 
distinct personalities.  Meles and Isaias \"were as brothers 
previously,\" Guelleh continued.  \"Now they are enemies.\"  He 
urged caution when talking with both men. \"Both are tough,\" 
Guelleh said, and \"there is a need to understand deeply the 
best means for their cooperation in order that they can 
achieve a better understanding of each other in social, 
political and other areas.\" 
6. (C) Guelleh expressed hope that Ethiopia would take the 
first step to find a solution to the Ethiopia-Eritrea 
conflict and to compromise. \"Someone should say that there 
are principles that should be applied.  Eritrea is saying 
implement the decision of the Boundary Commission, then talk. 
 Ethiopia is saying let us talk first because there is no 
guarantee that accepting the Boundary Commission\'s findings 
will make for a permanent peace.\"  From Ethiopia\'s 
perspective, Guelleh said, one needs to see how the border 
ruling will affect people on the ground. 
 
7. (C) Robeson replied that he hoped a regionalization of 
focus would help heal these kinds of differences.  He urged a 
NATO-like arrangement for the region that could achieve some 
of the same results seen in the aftermath of World War II in 
Europe.  Guelleh responded positively, saying he believed 
that with respect to Eritrea and Ethiopia, a lack of 
understanding exists from the top.  When two peoples are so 
inter-linked, their Heads of State should be obliged to talk. 
 Guelleh expressed his conviction that if Meles and Isaias 
could talk to each other \"if only for one hour,\" they would 
be able to resolve their differences.  Guelleh told Robeson 
that Djibouti is working directly with the Chairman of the 
African Union to achieve this outcome. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Looking Towards the Broader Region 
---------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Robeson noted the initial encouraging signals he had 
received in response to CJTF HOA\'s regional Chiefs of Defense 
conference which took place in late April, especially to 
proposals for billeting and training an Ugandan and Kenyan 
platoon, and perhaps other troops at Camp Lemonier.  Guelleh 
responded that Djibouti \"would be very happy to work with 
them.\"  He continued that if responsible working level people 
from countries in the region can have good relations with 
each other, that would facilitate an improved political 
climate in the region. 
 
---------------------- 
The Arab League Summit 
---------------------- 
 
9. (C) Ambassador raised with Guelleh his planned departure 
the following day for Tunis to attend the Arab League Summit. 
 Guelleh confirmed his attendance and said he hoped the 
session would be fruitful.  A key item that needs to be 
discussed, he stated, is the situation in the 
Israeli-occupied territories and the activities of Israeli 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon with respect to the Palestinians. 
On a positive note, Guelleh said, Israel had apologized for 
the most recent outcome of its actions in the Rafah refugee 
camp in Gaza.  He said it is important to press firmly for a 
two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the 
Palestinians.  Ambassador responded that President Bush has 
reiterated on more than one occasion his strong support for 
such a solution. She also noted that the U.S. had abstained 
in a mid-week vote at the U.N. on a resolution on Israel\'s 
incursion into Gaza. 
 
-------------------- 
Change of Command 
-------------------- 
 
10. (C) Robeson referred President Guelleh to his successor, 
General Helland, and briefed on Helland\'s achievements during 
his long military career.  Helland acknowledged Guelleh\'s 
welcoming response.  He was pleased to be in Djibouti and 
looked forward to working very closely with Guelleh and the 
members of his team.  Guelleh stated that all in the Horn of 
Africa region welcome the presence of America.  He described 
Robeson as a \"pioneer,\" who had taken responsibility as 
Commander of CJTF HOA, and  had created \"something from 
nothing\" while developing real relations with components in 
the region.  The result, Guelleh said, has been the creation 
of a good working climate of relations between very different 
peoples. 
 
11. (C) General Robeson cleared on this cable prior to his 
departure from Djibouti.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Mohammed M. Ali Yamani, owner of Maya Trading and Real 
Estate Development Company in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 
approached Ambassador and Management Officer May 17 regarding 
the USG offer to the Government of Djibouti to purchase a 
parcel of land in the Haramous section of Djibouti ville for 
a new Embassy compound (NEC) (See reftels).  In a meeting at 
the Embassy, Yamani stated that he is the sole owner of the 
parcel in question and that the parcel is part of a villa 
development project he is planning for the area.  Yamani 
refuted our understanding that the Government of Djibouti 
owned the parcel and produced a contract and a Djibouti 
presidential decree which, when translated, appeared to 
corroborate his assertion. Yamani also offered the property 
(40,321 square meters) that is the subject of our interest, 
plus an adjoining 7121 square meters we understood was owned 
by another buyer, all for the amount of \"between USD 250 and 
USD 300\" per square meter.  (Note: Yamani stated that the 
7121 square meter piece is NOT repeat NOT owned by anyone 
else. His suggested price is significantly higher than the 
amount we offered the Government of Djibouti for the parcel. 
End note.) 
 
2. (U) Ambassador subsequently sought clarification of 
Yamani\'s assertions in separate meetings with Minister of 
Presidential Affairs Osman Ahmed Moussa, and Minister of 
Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mahmoud Ali 
Youssef.  Moussa, who was signatory to the Yamani contract, 
stated that the contract does not convey ownership to Yamani 
and that he would provide further clarification of this in 
the next couple of days.  He did not do so.  Youssef, on the 
other hand, noted that he would be accompanying President 
Ismail Omar Guelleh the following day to Tunis to attend the 
Arab League Summit, would raise the matter enroute, and would 
respond when he returned three days later.  Youssef followed 
through on his pledge and in a brief to Ambassador, declared 
that Yamani does not own the parcel.  He said Yamani has not 
paid for any part of the site he intends to develop and that 
the Government of Djibouti would pass a presidential decree 
the very next day reserving to the USG the 40,321 square 
meters site.  In addition, Youssef stated that President 
Guelleh told him the U.S. should not negotiate anything with 
Yamani. 
 
3. (U) Ambassador responded that this statement of ownership 
alone would not appear to clear the matter.  Yamani has 
stated a claim and he may very well challenge the new decree 
judicially.  Youssef reassured that Yamani had no say in the 
matter, and that if he attempted to challenge the 
presidential decree, he could well lose all of his 
development project.  Ambassador impressed upon Youssef the 
importance of the Government of Djibouti clarifying this 
matter with Yamani, who is based in Jeddah.  We hope it will 
follow through. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador also told Youssef that Yamani wanted to 
sell to the USG a total of 47,442 square meters, which 
includes a section of the parcel that we understood had been 
reserved by another buyer.  She told Youssef that Yamani 
indicated the section is available.  Youssef responded that 
the decree could be amended before it is printed in the 
official gazette on May 26 to reserve the full rectangular 
parcel (47,442 square meters vice 40,321 square meters) for 
the USG.  Ambassador will seek clarification first if 
reservation of the full parcel will obligate the USG to buy 
the full parcel.  If it does not, we will ask the Government 
of Djibouti to reserve the full parcel (per Ragsdale/OBO 
telcon).  (Note: If OBO decides it wishes subsequently to 
take the full rectangular parcel, there would obviously need 
to be a slight adjustment upward in its original USD 1.8 
million offer to purchase. The advantage of the complete 
parcel is that it would give the USG full control of the NEC 
site from all sides.  End note.) 
 
5. (C) OBO may wish to begin thinking now about what it will 
do or should do with the existing embassy site.  Abdurahman 
Boreh, a prominent businessman in Djibouti with close ties to 
President Guelleh, told Ambassador on two separate occasions 
that the Government of Djibouti will want \"to possess\" the 
existing Embassy site once the U.S. vacates.  He stated that 
the Government of Djibouti will not approve closure of two 
roads -- one at the current site and one at the new site -- 
should the U.S. wish to retain the current site.  While the 
current site does not meet our security requirements and is 
small, it is in a prime location, is developed with several 
sound structures, and will likely have a number of interested 
buyers -- including other Governments and organizations with 
representation here.  Perhaps a land swap with the Government 
of Djibouti might be of interest.  In any case, this issue 
may be possible leverage as we enter into negotiations with 
the owner -- once determined -- of the proposed NEC site. 
6. (U) Embassy will seek clarification from its attorney, 
Alain Martinet, on implications of the decree and related 
issues.

  Africa and a strategic partner in the War on Terror. 
  Exposure to Americans has been limited and the population, 
  which is 90 percent Muslim, is often ambivalent about the 
  United States and our presence in country. As the only 
  French speaking country in English speaking East Africa, our 
  ability to tap into regional resources is limited. We 
  believe the international visitors program is an important 
  step to building strong Francophone support in this front

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI CELEBRATES INTERNATIONAL ANTI-TOBACCO DAY 
 
 1. (U) The Ministry of Health and the World Health 
Organization co-hosted Djibouti\'s celebration of the \"Journee 
Mondiale Sans Tabac (International Anti-Tobacco Day) on May 
31.  Pol/Econ officer joined international organization 
members and women\'s groups in attendance at the 
mini-conference the Ministry organized that covered the 
economic, social, health and religious impacts of tobacco 
use.  Khat chewing and Shisha smoking were also addressed as 
health risks that fall in the same category as smoking. 
Speeches given focused on an overarching link between poverty 
and the higher prevalence of tobacco addiction and other 
health issues related to tobacco.  The May 31 edition of La 
Nation ran an article on the health risks of tobacco uses, 
drawing many of their points from speeches given at the 
conference.  RTD (Radio Television Djibouti) was present at 
the conference and was expected to air details of the 
conference on the nation\'s evening news programs. 
 
2. (U) The coverage given to anti-tobacco campaigns in a 
country where more than 50 percent of the population smokes 
may be a trend that began in the higher ranks of the 
government.  In a May 16 broadcast of CNN\'s \"Diplomatic 
License\" hosted by Richard Roth, Djiboutian Ambassador to the 
United States Roble Olhaye spoke briefly on Djibouti\'s recent 
signing of the UN Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. 
Ambassador Olhaye commented that there have been small 
successes in reducing smoking but with the signing of the 
treaty, he said he fully expected a greater impact.  Djibouti 
signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control two days 
after the U.S. signed.

REF: DJIBOUTI 0741 (AND PREVIOUS) 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE 
FOR REASON 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (U) At the invitation of the Djiboutian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Ambassador, Management Officer and General 
Services Officer met on June 1 with representatives of MFA, 
Mohamed Ali Hassan, Director of Bilateral Relations, and 
Secretary General Badri Ali Bogoreh.  The purpose of this 
 
SIPDIS 
meeting was for MFA to hand over to the Embassy Decree number 
2004-0098/PR/MEFPCP dated May 29, 2004, signed by President 
Guelleh. 
 
2. (SBU) The Decree grants the USG 40,321 square meters of 
land in Djibouti\'s Haramous district for construction of a 
new embassy.  MFA representatives also wanted to finalize 
payment terms and conditions of the land purchase.  Both 
parties agreed the land would be acquired at the Embassy\'s 
offer price of $1.8 million.  This would exclude the small 
plot of land approximately 7,000 sq. meters, adjoining the 
proposed site. 
 
3. (U) Ambassador raised the concern that Mohamed Ali Yamani 
of Maya Trading Real Estate Development Co. (Maya) could 
subsequently interfere in the transaction by claiming land 
ownership based on the urban development contract signed by 
Maya and the Government of Djibouti dated February 4, 2004, 
and a previous Presidential Decree (2004-0026) ratifying the 
transaction.  The contract provides Maya with a temporary 
land grant (\"concession provisoire\") of 840,000 sq. meters 
for which payment is due in five annual installments starting 
in 2006.  The contract\'s seventh article obliges Maya to 
begin development during the first half of 2004.  While it is 
the Government of Djibouti\'s position that Maya holds a 
temporary grant only, Yamani may seek clarification with the 
Government of Djibouti regarding land title covered in the 
urban development contract.  The MFA representatives 
underscored that the Djiboutian Government remains 
titleholder of the proposed NEC site and chooses to sell the 
property to the USG. 
 
4. (U) The present Decree is an official decision by 
President Guelleh and reflects a commitment taken at Cabinet 
level.  The decision will be followed up, reportedly this 
week, with a diplomatic note.  For the Government of 
Djibouti, this note and Decree 2004-0098/PR/MEFPCP, should be 
interpreted as having full force.  For the MFA, any further 
dealings related to Yamani\'s claim would only cloud the 
transaction.  Ambassador affirmed our preference to work 
solely with MFA representatives to close the property deal. 
In response to Hassan\'s inquiry as to when payment could be 
made, Ambassador said she believed payment could be processed 
within 30 days of the closing and requested that the MFA 
specify in its diplomatic note preferred payment method and 
terms.  The Management Officer stressed the need to move as 
soon as possible to finalize this transaction since 
construction of the NEC is likely to commence within the next 
two years. 
 
5. (U) Later the same day, Ambassador, Management Officer and 
General Services Officer met with the Embassy\'s legal 
counsel, Alain Martinet, to understand where the USG stands 
legally if it proceeds with purchase from the Government of 
Djibouti.  Martinet first remarked that the present Decree 
does not identify which lot of Maya\'s temporary grant will be 
sold to the USG.  He also noted that before Yamani\'s urban 
development contract was signed, OBO/REPM/AQD\'s visit in 
December 2003 marked the Government\'s promise to sell the 
Haramous property to the USG.  It is now incumbent upon the 
Government to consult with Yamani to clarify the status of 
the urban development contract.  Martinet advised the USG not 
to approach Yamani directly on these issues in order to leave 
the matter for resolution between the Government of Djibouti 
and Maya. 
 
6. (U) With the assistance of Ibrahim Hamadou, Director of 
Land Records and Revenues at the Ministry of Finance, 
Martinet will confirm the legal titleholder of the proposed 
NEC site.  This is recorded, he said, in Djibouti\'s land 
registry (\"Livre foncier\").  Hamadou could also check the 
exact location of the land plot referenced in the present 
Decree.  Finally, Martinet would verify ownership of the 
adjoining lot to the proposed NEC site.  To protect the USG\'s 
interests, Martinet advised that the Government of Djibouti 
should issue another Decree stating the primacy of the 
current Decree over both the previous Decree involving Maya 
and the urban development contract.  Without an accord 
between the Djiboutian Government and Maya, he said, it would 
be possible for Yamani to seek damages from Djibouti, 
including return of the land plot.  Such a dispute would be 
resolved by international arbitration and the Paris court 
system, according to their contract.  However, should the 
matter go to court, enforcing the ruling in Djibouti will be 
problematic.  Martinet could not be specific as to the 
consequences for the USG, but indicated it would be 
disruptive (legally/public relations?).  It is now important 
for the USG to finalize the transaction with MFA and obtain a 
permanent land grant (\"concession definitive\"), Martinet 
said.  He continued that immediately following the 
transaction, the Embassy should also install a provisional 
perimeter fence around the plot to indicated ownership and to 
ensure that others do not build on it. 
 
7. (U) Embassy will pass copy of promised diplomatic note 
referenced in para 4 as soon as MFA provides. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  While the Government of Djibouti insists its 
May 31 Presidential Decree overrides any pre-existing 
contract, we are not certain if Yamani, or binding law, will 
hold the same view.  This will be an especially pertinent 
point if Martinet determines that Yamani is legal 
titleholder, after an examination of records.  If Yamani 
challenges and heads to arbitration, it will be a matter 
between Yamani and the Government, but could possibly delay 
our ratification of purchase and eventual construction.  He 
may also choose to bring the USG into a legal deliberation. 
We do not believe the Government of Djibouti plans to 
coordinate with Yamani. 
 
9. (C) Comment continued:  The nature of Yamani\'s contract 
also raises issues as the Government of Djibouti and Martinet 
told us that the contract sets a June 30 deadline for Yamani 
to begin preparation of the Haramous tract or the contract is 
null and void.  We will need to proceed carefully and should 
await the MFA\'s diplomatic note before deciding next step.

SUBJECT: PK12 RETURNS TO FULL OPERATIONS AFTER MAY EXPLOSION 
 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: The International Board of Broadcasters 
(IBB) radio station at PK12 is back to full operations after 
an explosion and subsequent detection of unexploded 
ordinance (UXO) on the site. Plans for full site clearance 
continue. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U)  At 2am on May 3 an explosion took place in an unused 
area of the PK12 compound, IBB\'s Radio Sawa site in 
Djibouti, which is a former French firing range. No one was 
injured and property damage was minimal.The explosion was 
determined by Djiboutian authorities and the RSO to be 
caused by UXO and not/not to be criminally related in any 
way. RSO prohibited all USG employees from accessing the 
site as a safety concern until the situation could be 
further examined and resolved. 
 
3. (U) IBB is currently pursuing full-clearance of the site 
through the engagement of two possible providers: The U.S. 
Military and the Djiboutian Military. Any clearance 
agreement would cover the entire site, plus 150-ft. from 
site perimeter. The Djiboutian military would sign a 
liability waiver in case of injury to their personnel during 
the clearance process. All associated costs would be borne 
by IBB. 
 
4. (U) On May 26, the RSO approved the return of American 
personnel to cleared areas of the site contingent upon 
posting of warning signs in multiple languages around 
affected area and briefings for all personnel on safety 
issues. 
 
5. (U) Every station employee (USG and local partner) was 
briefed. Security personnel at IBB and DOS, as well as Post 
and IBB management approved the content of the briefing. At 
Post\'s recommendation, each station employee signed a 
statement attesting that he or she had been instructed on 
which areas of IBB property were off-limits. These forms 
will be kept on file by IBB. 
 
6. (U) A team of explosives experts from Camp Lemonier 
surveyed the site. In this initial survey 36 pieces of 
unexploded ordinance were found and destroyed. The team 
leader proposed that the Camp Lemonier group provide a full 
sweep and clearance of the site in conjunction with the 
Djiboutian demining team. The clearance would be a training 
exercise, with minimal associated costs borne by IBB. 
 
7. (U) Comment: It is the opinion of the team leader that 
little or no additional ordinance will be found on the site; 
however, there is some concern that locals are finding UXO 
and bringing it to the site for disposal. The 36 pieces were 
removed from an unused area of the compound that is 
surrounded by a chain link fence, in addition to the usual 
perimeter fence and security.  No/no ordinance was found on 
developed areas of the compound. 
 
8. (SBU) The JAG at Camp Lemonier has rejected the team 
leader\'s proposal on the following grounds: 
 
\"From 10 United States Code Section 401, entitled 
\"Humanitarian and civic 
assistance provided in conjunction with military 
operations\": (a)(4) \"The Secretary of Defense shall ensure 
that no member of the armed forces, while providing 
assistance under this section that is described in 
subsection (e)(5)---(A) engages in the physical detection, 
lifting, or destroying of landmines (unless the member does 
so for the concurrent purpose of supporting a United States 
military operation); or (B) provides such assistance as part 
of a military operation that does not involve the armed 
forces.\" (e)(5) \"Detection and clearance of landmines, 
including activities relating to the furnishing of 
education, training, and technical assistance with respect 
to 
the detection and clearance of landmines.\" 
 
9. (SBU) Post and IBB and question whether the JAG 
interpretation is accurate given that this clearance does 
not deal with landmines and would take place on USG 
property. We understand that a similar project took place at 
the IBB site in Kuwait in 1993, with UXO cleared by DOD. IBB 
is following up through appropriate DOD channels in 
Washington.

TAGS: PREL, MARR, KPAO, FR, DJ, BBG 
SUBJECT: IBB SIGNAL INTERFERES WITH FRENCH RADIO OPERATIONS 
 
 
1.   (U) SUMMARY: The Commander of French Forces in Djibouti 
  told the Ambassador that signals from the International 
  Board of Broadcasters (IBB) Radio Sawa tower at PK12 were 
  interfering with French radio operations in Djibouti. Tests 
  by IBB imply that the problem rests in structural 
  deficiencies in the French HF towers as IBB signals are well 
  within normal and legal range. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   (U) During a regularly scheduled meeting at the end of 
  March, The Commander of French Forces in Djibouti, General 
  Gerard Pons, told Ambassador Ragsdale that signals from 
  IBB\'s Radio Sawa tower at PK12 were interfering with French 
  radio operations in Djibouti. He requested the Ambassador\'s 
  assistance in resolving the interference. 
 
3.   (U) PAO contacted technical experts at IBB and was 
  informed that the signals were well within acceptable 
  strength range and were being broadcast on a licensed 
  frequency. IBB hypothesized that the interference was likely 
  due to grounding problems with the French HF towers and 
  suggested the French buy filters and/or reground the towers. 
 
4.   (U) On April 8, IBB contacted the French Air Base 
  (`FAB\') in Djibouti about the continued problem and offered 
  to test the signal strength. However, as it was necessary 
  for the French to grant access to the problem towers to 
  conduct the tests, FAB declined. (NOTE: IBB technical 
  experts speculate that the French towers may be sensitive, 
  which might explain FAB\'s reluctance to grant access to the 
  problem equipment for testing. END NOTE). 
 
5.   (U) On April 28, a representative from IBB, the PAO and 
  a French technical contractor working at PK12 (`USG Team\') 
  met with several representatives of FAB. FAB informed IBB 
  that it was picking up Radio Sawa on HF towers used for 
  receiving signals. FAB also informed USG Team that the 
  interference problems had stopped after the extensive 
  flooding in Djibouti on April 13. 
 
6.   (U) The USG Team concluded that the sudden lack of 
  interference after ground saturation proved IBB\'s initial 
  grounding hypothesis and said that the problem appeared to 
  lie with structural deficiencies (grounding) with the French 
  towers. IBB stated that the problem would likely return 
  after the earth dried and offered to test the towers for 
  signal problems to confirm this hypothesis. FAB declined. 
  (see para 4). USG Team also offered FAB general advice for 
  resolving grounding problems. 
 
7.   (U) On May 16, FAB again contacted IBB about 
  interference and requested resolution, stating its belief 
  that the problem rested with the IBB signal strength. IBB 
  was granted access that same day to the problem towers and 
  used its own materials and experts to test signal strength 
  in conjunction with FAB. Testing proved that the IBB PK12 
  emissions were well within the International 
  Telecommunication Union standards for high-power broadcast 
  transmitters. Harmonic levels were measured at -80 (ITU 
  minimum is -70). 
 
8.   (U) Testing also determined that there should be no 
  interference, despite any HF grounding problems, as long as 
  the Radio Sawa signal remained in \"directional\" 
  transmission, the normal transmission mode. Although IBB has 
  licensed authority to transmit a non-directional signal, it 
  told Post it would only do so in cases of emergency or 
  extreme technical difficulty. 
 
9.   FAB witnessed the testing and acknowledged that the 
  procedures, process and measurement results were correct and 
  accurate. Post notes, however, that IBB observed FAB\'s HF 
  antenna system was below minimum accepted industry standards 
  for receiving antennas (the antenna grounding system was 
  absent in some places and eroded in others). IBB prepared 
  and delivered a technical report detailing necessary repairs 
  for the FAB HF receiving antenna system. 
 
10.  (SBU) COMMENT: IBB and AMEMBASSY Djibouti have made 
  every effort to be accommodating and helpful to the French 
  on this issue. General Pons seemed satisfied with the 
  outcome during a recent meeting with the Ambassador. Radio 
  interference problems currently being experienced by the 
  French are likely do to structural deficiencies with the 
  French HF towers. Post now considers this matter closed. END 
  COMMENT.

SUBJECT: TRIP REPORT: SELF-HELP SITE VISITS TO OUTER 
DISTRICTS 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Pol/Econ officer and Self-Help Clerk 
(SHC) traveled to the Southern districts of Dikhil and 
Ali Sabieh, May 16 and 17 and to the Northern districts 
of Tadjourah and Obock, June 1,2 and 3 to visit FY02 
and FY03 projects for follow-up and close-out visits, 
as well as initial visits for FY04 proposed projects. 
Both trips were highly productive and fairly well 
received by the different communities.  The following 
is a detailed trip report for both trips. End Summary. 
 
ALI SABIEH 
---------- 
2. (U) Ali Sabieh is one of Djibouti\'s smaller districts, 
situated southeast of Djibouti City bordering both 
Somalia and Ethiopia.  The town of Ali Sabieh lies just 
off the main trucking route into Ethiopia.  The district 
is home to the three refugee camps presently operating 
in Djibouti - Ali Adde, Holhol and Aour Aoussa.  The 
population of the district engages mainly in farming and 
herding of small livestock, though unemployment is a 
large problem for those in the main town.  This trend was 
very apparent in all of the districts visited.  The 
region is in the higher elevations giving it cooler 
temperatures than the lowland desert climates of Djibouti 
City and the large middle portion of the country. 
However, it still has the same arid landscape prevalent 
throughout Djibouti and water, as usual, is a primary 
concern.  For these reasons the Self-Help projects chosen 
in the Ali Sabieh district are especially vital to the 
livelihood of the communities.  From FY02 and FY03 
Self-Help funds, Embassy Djibouti was able to fund three 
projects focusing on water, farming and a sewing workshop 
for unemployed women. 
 
3. (U) In the small village of Dourreh, about 45 minutes 
drive from Ali Adde, the community requested Self-Help 
funds to reinforce and renovate existing wells, assist 
farmers in purchasing tools and equipment, and conduct 
training on soil and water conservation.  The two wells 
visited had been reinforced to provide greater protection 
from the erosion caused by rains flowing through the Oued. 
 
4. (U) The area immediately surrounding the Ali Adde 
refugee camp is one that has very few sources for potable 
water.  Currently, the villagers have to use the well 
inside the camp because it is the closest source to the 
town.  The community proposed building a well at another 
watering hole nearby to the majority of herders and farmers, 
however this site was claimed by the government so finding 
a new site was necessary.  The watering hole also happens 
to be located on the edge of the Oued, which would have 
inevitably meant that a flood could ruin the well 
completely.  This project is still underway, but the 
association has chosen a new site in a more secure spot 
along the Oued and has addressed the issue of 
counteracting erosion from the rains.  Once completed, it 
will provide a great service to the local population. 
 
5. (U) In the town of Ali Sabieh many women are without 
jobs, as well as many men.  The local women\'s association, 
which is one of the most active in the community, proposed 
a sewing workshop to train the young girls and women of 
the town.  The association uses a building in the old 
Catholic center that is no longer in use as a place where 
the women can come to work and display their products.  The 
sale of the products goes partially to the seamstress and 
partially to continuing the sewing workshop.  This 
association also has used a loan from the Fonds 
Djiboutienne de Development (Djiboutian Development Fund) 
to start its own microcredit service to help local women 
get their own businesses and ventures started.  The 
association started with a loan benefiting 20 women 
participating in the microcredit service and has been able 
to pay back the initial loan in full and expand the service 
to benefit 45 women. 
 
6. (U) Meetings with the town\'s various associations 
showed many needs, but a distinct lack of coordination 
among the different groups.  Three different groups 
expressed the need for youth sports venues and several 
mentioned the need for computer training and access.  One 
group had purchased computers but couldn\'t pay for the 
utilities necessary to run an information center, though 
if the group housed the computers at the town\'s Centre de 
Development Communitaire (CDC) it could have benefited 
from the government paid electricity.  Community leaders 
expressed some doubts about the program, reflecting on 
the lack of coordination and knowledge of the program 
throughout the community in past years.  Pol/Econ and 
Self-Help Clerk (SHC) addressed their concerns and 
highlighted the need for a better coordination, not only 
among associations but between the community and the 
Embassy.  Pol/Econ emphasized that in past years there 
may not have been a lot of interaction with the 
communities, but that the reason for this trip was to 
begin building a relationship with the community. 
 
DIKHIL 
------ 
7. (U) Neighboring the district of Ali Sabieh is the 
largest district in the country, Dikhil.  Dikhil\'s 
borders extend from the Ethiopian/Djiboutian border to 
the Gulf of Tadjourah.  Covering the mid-section of 
Djibouti, the climate is hotter and more arid than that 
of Ali Sabieh lending to many of the same concerns in 
the communities and in the main towns.  As in the other 
districts, wherever there is a slightly cooler climate 
and some vegetation nomadic herders and farmers can be 
found.  It is no different in Dikhil.  The highest 
levels of traffic to Ethiopia also have to pass through 
Dikhil.  This puts a heavy burden on the District\'s 
roads, which in some areas are becoming more rough, 
narrow and dangerous at night as more trucks travel 
them.  As in Ali Sabieh, Dikhil has not been very 
active in the Self-Help program in the past years and 
many of the same concerns were raised.  In FY02 and 
FY03, Embassy Self-Help funds were able to provide the 
materials for three projects to their individual 
communities.  The rehabilitation of a youth center, a 
soccer field, and a sewing center that was recently 
inaugurated by the Ambassador. 
 
8. (U) Many of the towns in the Dikhil district are 
either isolated and far removed from the main roads, or 
centered entirely on catering to the trucking industry. 
For these communities, the youth is a major emphasis. 
It is no surprise that alternative activities for youth 
are a major emphasis when the 50 percent unemployment 
rate is put next to the age ratios.  Forty-three percent 
of all Djiboutians are under the age of 14 and the median 
age of the entire population is eighteen.  Yoboki is one 
of Dikhil\'s towns that has the major trucking route going 
through the center of town.  The community youth 
association proposed the creation of a soccer field to 
provide the youth of the area an alternative to the 
vices that can sometimes come through with the trucking 
industry. 
 
9. (U) In stark contrast to Yoboki, As Eyla is so far 
from the main road that a local guide was needed to find 
the town.  The heavy rains in April had made it 
inaccessible, so several different roads were created to 
bypass the damaged parts.  In the middle of the desert 
the community is well organized.  The proposal from the 
community was to rehabilitate the town\'s youth center so 
that the large youth population would have some 
alternative to keep children from delinquency.  The 
project was well ahead of schedule and once finished 
will provide the youth with a library, a gathering room 
and a place to study after school. 
 
TADJOURAH 
--------- 
10. (U) Tadjourah is one of the larger districts in the 
country, located in the Northern part of the country with 
its borders extending from the Ethiopia to the coastline. 
Tadjourah\'s landscape is mostly mountainous and has a 
cooler climate than most of the other areas in the country 
but still suffers from very limited rainfalls.  The coastal 
region of Tadjourah is able to support more vegetation 
than many areas in Djibouti, which also support several 
agricultural growers.  There is a growing number of 
fishermen taking advantage of this abundant resource in 
the Gulf of Tadjourah.  This industry is only recently 
developing because of less supportive cultural attitudes 
towards fishing. 
 
11. (U) Tadjourah is by far the most active district in 
the Self-Help program, having a total of ten projects 
over FY02 and FY03.  The community leaders consistently 
submit a greater number of proposals than the other 
outlying districts.  Most of the projects focus on water 
resources in hard to reach areas, though the town of 
Tadjourah has a diverse range of projects to counter 
the unemployment problem.  Within the town limits of 
Tadjourah, the Self-Help program has funded a 
library/reading room for youth, equipment for a 
vocational school, and a computer workshop.  The Cardin 
Vocational School, run by the Catholic church, was in 
the midst of final exams when Pol/Econ and SHC visited. 
The work coming out of these classes was very well done. 
The center can accommodate 16 students for each 
three-year program and has lodging for the students that 
come from far out of town.  The vocational school 
teaches four disciplines: electricity, mechanics, carpentry 
and masonry.  Skilled workers in each of these areas are 
in short supply throughout Djibouti. 
 
12. (U) Site visits to the more remote projects involve 
steep, rocky, twisting dirt roads that at times do not 
look wide enough for a single vehicle.  The village of 
Ardo is at the base of the mountain that Bankouale, one 
of Djibouti\'s remote tourist sites, sits on.  The women 
of the village rely heavily on the sale of their crafts 
to passing tourists.  The community\'s proposed craft 
center located at the entrance of the village was about 
half-way through construction and proceeding well. 
The community will use this center to house the 
villagers crafts and have the women take turns running 
the center and baking for passers-by. 
 
13. (U) Not so far from Ardo and Bankouale are the 
hilltop towns of Assaya and Saoub.  Water projects were 
proposed for each of these villages.  In Assaya, the dam 
that was proposed has been completed and has already 
proved effective.  The community constructed a dam to 
block silt from filling the natural watering hole and 
deepened the hole.  The last rains stayed in the watering 
hole for 23 days, a drastic improvement from before.  In 
Saoub, the project to create two cisterns to collect 
rainwater had been completed, though the second cistern was 
destroyed in the last stages of construction by the floods 
in early April.  The first cistern was dry when visited, 
but had held water for sometime after the floods. 
 
OBOCK 
----- 
14. (U) Obock neighbors the district of Tadjourah and 
covers the most of Djibouti\'s Northern coastline. 
Obock is even more arid than Tadjourah and is much 
more desolate.  Once the capital of Djibouti, the town 
of Obock was one of the most badly damaged cities 
during the civil war in the early nineties.  This may 
contribute to the feeling that the city and district 
has been forgotten by the government and many NGOs. 
Obock has not been very active in recent years, 
according to one association leader because the 
government and NGOs come and do not follow through 
on their promises. The leader added that the town has 
given up on outside help.  Pol/Econ and SHC emphasized 
that this was precisely the reason Self-Help would be 
productive in Obock.  SHC emphasized that there were 
two projects already underway in Obock from FY03, both 
focusing on developing farming and agriculture. 
Pol/Econ and SHC were able to visit one of the completed 
projects, which has seen some benefit but is 
experiencing slight problems with management of equipment. 
Pol/Econ and SHC advised the association sponsor on ways 
to improve the situation. 
 
15. (SBU) COMMENT: Post feels the Self-Help program is 
making a significant impact on communities inside and 
outside of Djibouti City.  The concept of associations and 
non-governmental civil society aid is new to the 
Djiboutian culture but seems to be firmly taking root. 
Proposals from larger towns like Tadjourah and Djibouti 
City are consistently dynamic, creative and address 
vital needs of the communities.  Post believes that with 
the recent addition of staffing to the Pol/Econ section 
and the Self-Help program, it will be able to be more 
visible in the outlying regions.  The lack of an American 
presence and the existence of only word-of-mouth knowledge 
of the Self-Help program seemed to be the most often 
mentioned shortcomings of the program.  The success rate 
of projects in Djibouti seems  fairly consistent and the 
program has had few serious issues arise over the course 
of project implementation.  Post feels Self-Help has 
been and will continue to be a vital part Mission 
Djibouti\'s success.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI: WALK IN 06/09/2004 
 
1. (SBU) On 06/09/2004 at about 0930 hours an individual 
walked into the American Embassy in Djibouti requesting to 
speak with an American official.  After careful screening, 
RSO and Embassy Force Protection Officer (FPO) conducted a 
preliminary interview with the individual.  The individual 
stated that his name is Ali Shire Adan Abdulle; D/POB - 
03/03/1954, Mogadishu, Somalia and provided an identification 
card to corroborate his information.  Abdulle claimed that he 
came to the Embassy on behalf of a friend that wished to sell 
the U.S. government radioactive material.  RSO and FPO 
convinced Abdulle to contact his friend so that he could come 
to the Embassy and discuss his situation in person.  His 
friend agreed and arrived at the Embassy approximately 20 
minutes later. 
 
2. (SBU) RSO and FPO interviewed Mr. Mahdi Ubaidi Muhsen; 
DPOB - 06/09/1957, Ethiopia.  Muhsen did not have any form of 
identification.  Muhsen claims that he is in possession of a 
container full of plutonium and that he wishes to sell it to 
the U.S. government.  When questioned as to how he obtained 
this product, Muhsen stated that he is part of a group of 
Ethiopians that acquired the container in late 2001, but 
could not provide more detail.  Muhsen also stated that he 
had a brief-case full of vials that contained a substance 
that he referred to as Red Mercury.  He further states that 
he had tried to notify someone at the American Embassy in 
Sanaa, but that his story was not believed by the person he 
spoke to.  Muhsen could not remember any details of his 
conversation. 
 
3. (SBU) RSO recognized the details of a scam that had been 
attempted on a number of U.S. Embassies in the region 
including Djibouti and U.S. Military personnel at Camp 
Lemonier several times before.  Subjects were confronted and 
advised that there attempts to extort money from the U.S. 
Government was a serious matter and RSO would report them to 
the authorities.  RSO strongly encouraged Subjects to cease 
and desist their attempts to sell their products.  In 
addition, RSO informed Subjects that he would be advising the 
Host Nation Police Forces and other Diplomatic Missions of 
their activities.  Furthermore, RSO informed them that if it 
is discovered that they are attempting to pull another scam 
they could be subject arrest.

SUBJECT: HIRING FOR DORALEH PORT AND FREE ZONE SPARK LOCAL 
PROTESTS 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Protests by residents of the Afar neighborhood of 
Arhiba blocked Rue d\'Arta for several hours on 8 June 2004. 
The protests were sparked by information that led the 
residents to believe that the workforce hired by Dubai Ports 
International to construct and run the Doraleh Port Facility 
would be primarily expatriates and not Djiboutians. 
 
2. (C) Another factor that led to the protests was the fear 
of discrimination against Afars in the hiring process for the 
new port.  (Note: According to Econ FSN, Afars sense that 
national hiring practices have been discriminatory towards 
them and that a hiring quota similar to the allocation in 
place at the National Assembly should be extended to all 
sectors of government and the economy. End Note.)  Post\'s 
source at the Ministry of Justice indicates that Afar 
residents of Arhiba are demanding an agreement with the 
Government of Djibouti that all future hiring for the Doraleh 
Port Facility and the Djibouti Free Zone should guarantee a 
certain number of jobs to Afars. 
 
3. (C) The protests, largely street demonstrations, were 
broken up by the police, but only after negotiations. 
According to a police source, the units dispatched to the 
protests were instructed to make no arrests, use no violent 
force, and to negotiate a peaceful end.  These instructions 
are apparently the result of bad blood between the residents 
of Arhiba and the police, due to a particularly violent clash 
with Arhiba residents in the early nineties.  The police 
successfully negotiated an end to the protest on the terms 
that the residents would get the chance to meet with the 
Prime Minister and discuss their demand for a quota.  The 
same source said that the Arhiba residents will prepare a 
list of all Afar workers and their skill level, which will be 
given to the government.  The meeting with the Prime Minister 
is scheduled for the morning of 9 June.  Post will follow-up 
on the developments from this meeting. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: Post cannot confirm whether the work force 
hired for Doraleh Port Facility will be majority expatriate 
or not.  A meeting with the Doraleh construction supervisor 
revealed that of the nearly 2,000 employees to be hired, only 
250-300 would be Djiboutian.  This number was based on their 
assessment on the level of skilled workers present in 
Djibouti.  However, in a meeting with Abdourahman Boreh, the 
main Djiboutian force behind the Doraleh project, Ambassador 
was told that there would be a majority of Djiboutians hired 
and only those skills not present in Djibouti would be 
brought in from Dubai. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: The lack of skilled workers in 
Djibouti\'s workforce is the key roadblock to most foreign 
investment.  Without a strong surge in Djibouti\'s 
entrepreneurial spirit and a push to provide vocational 
training to the population, the government will not be able 
to provide Djiboutians the volume of job opportunities they 
seek. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED: RSO and U.S. Military Force 
Protection officers have been closely monitoring this 
protest.  Presently, there are no indications that the U.S. 
Embassy and U.S. Military Base or any of its personnel are at 
risk.  Although tensions are high among protesters and some 
vandalism has occurred in the form of rock throwing and 
burning tires, the crowds have stayed within the area of 
protest.  Americans have been advised to avoid those areas in 
which the protesters gather until the demonstrations have 
subsided. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI INAUGURATES FREE ZONE WITH SUPPORT FROM 
DUBAI INTERNATIONAL 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 597 
 
1. (U) Summary: Djibouti and its United Arab Emirates 
investor, Dubai International (DI), inaugurated June 5 the 
new Djibouti Free Zone (DFZ) with the participation of 
President Guelleh, cabinet officials, heads of diplomatic 
missions, and potential DFZ investors. The project, billed 
\"the first of its kind in Africa,\" is expected to change 
Djibouti\'s economic face and create a virtual Dubai in the 
Horn of Africa.  Ambitious to some, and a saving grace to 
others, the project -- along with the new Doraleh port coming 
on line in 2005 -- is seen as the gateway for trade to the 
African continent.  The DFZ offers pre-built warehouse units, 
open storage sheds, and land plots with benefits to include 
100 per cent foreign ownership, the absence of corporate 
taxes, duties, and currency restrictions, 100 percent 
repatriation of capital and profits, world class management 
practices, professional administrative support, and good 
quality logistics infrastructure.  Fifty-eight per cent of 
available warehouse space has been leased in the project\'s 
first phase, with Phase II and III to be completed by 2006. 
End summary. 
 
------------------------ 
The Compatibility Factor 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Djibouti launched its 17-hectare Free Zone on June 5. 
The zone, billed as the first of its kind in Africa, will be 
under the guidance and management of Jebel Ali Free Zone 
International (JAFZI) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
Applicants for space in the project are being offered the 
choice of warehouse units built to standards of those in 
Jebel Ali, or a plot of land on which to build their own 
customized facility.  JAFZI is touting the compatibility of 
warehousing, storage, distribution, light manufacturing and 
value-added activities of DFZ with Common Market for Eastern 
and Southern Africa (COMESA) rules of origin and the Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade agreement. 
 
----------------------- 
Incentives and Benefits 
----------------------- 
 
3. (U) Incentives and benefits offered by the DFZ will 
largely mirror those at Jebel Ali and will include, but not 
be limited to, 100 percent foreign ownership, the absence of 
corporate taxes, duties, and currency restrictions, 100 per 
cent repatriation of capital and profits, world class 
management practices, professional administrative support, 
and quality logistical infrastructure. Dubai-produced 
promotion material for the project highlighted the 
\"pro-business attitude of Djibouti in developing a 
diversified and self-sufficient economy\" and the intent of 
the DFZ \"to provide business investors in Africa with a 
platform from which to tap in to the potential of the African 
market.\"  Djibouti\'s  port and international airport (both 
currently managed by Dubai Ports International-DPI), plus the 
highway and rail link directly to Ethiopia\'s capital, and the 
soon-to-be completed new port and oil terminal at Doraleh, 7 
kilometers from Djbouti port, would support the DFZ. 
 
------------------------- 
Optimism from Investors 
------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The President of Djibouti, Ismail Omar Guelleh, Prime 
Minister of Djibouti, Dileita Mohamed Dileita, President of 
the Djiboutian National Assembly, Idriss Arnaoud Ali, 
Executive Chairman of Ports, Customs and Free Zone 
Corporation (the global parent of DPI and JAFZI), Sultan Bin 
Sulayem, the Executive Chairman of PCFC, Managing Director or 
Dubai International (DI), Mohammed Sharaf, and key Djiboutian 
investor Abdurahman Boreh participated in the inaugural 
event.  Also attending were a host of Djiboutian cabinet 
ministers, Djiboutian military leaders, members of 
parliament, heads of missions accredited to Djibouti and 
business persons from both Djibouti and the UAE. Ambassador 
and USLO represented Embassy Djibouti. 
 
5. (U) In remarks at the inauguration, DI Managing Director 
Sharaf noted his objective  to create an international 
network of free zones as a step towards enhancing Dubai\'s 
leading position in business.  In Djibouti, he said, a strong 
logistical free zone similar to Jebel Ali could service the 
African continent.  He told the assembled guests that 58 per 
cent of the existing warehouse space at DFZ had been leased 
with a further 8 per cent under option.  Forty-six per cent 
of current participants, Sharaf said, were from Dubai, 46 per 
cent from Djibouti, and 8 per cent from Ethiopia.  He also 
said the high demand for facilities and services had prompted 
a phase two development which would include an additional 34 
leased warehouse units and a 9,100 square meters short 
storage warehouse for humanitarian aid cargo.  Phase III of 
the project, to be implemented in 2006, will include 25 
warehouses and a new 64-unit office complex for trading and 
service sectors.  Sharaf said Phase III would dovetail with 
the new Doraleh port which would be fully on line by then. 
 
6. (U) In his speech, Abdurahman Boreh said the DFZ is part 
of the vision of President Guelleh to create a world class 
port and free zone in Djibouti.  The aim is to take advantage 
of services for income generation, as there is no other 
option, given the country\'s lack of resources.  He said 
Djibouti wants to attract quality foreign investment and 
described the hope and progress he saw in the new Doraleh 
port. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Vision, Success, and the Government\'s Commitment 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7. (U) Sultan Sulayem said the DFZ began \"as a result of a 
vision.\"  In addition, the success of DPI in managing both 
Djibouti\'s port and international airport \"has given us the 
confidence to start other projects in Djibouti\".  He 
mentioned the work of Han-Padron, a U.S. engineering 
consulting firm, which is preparing a master study for DI on 
the city of Djibouti, covering its airport, port, free zones 
and power and water needs.  Sulayem said it is important to 
ensure the success of what is being done in Djibouti. 
Results of the study will be initially presented to DI in 
November, 2004 and in final form in January 2005.  Sulayem 
also said plans are afoot to develop a 400-room five-star 
hotel in Djibouti, as well as 100 luxury villas and 500 
apartments. 
 
8. (U) In his turn, President Guelleh spoke of the strong 
relations between Djibouti and the UAE over the years. He 
said Djibouti wants to play a principal role in Africa and it 
is important to develop Djibouti and to get others to invest. 
He invited those listening to \"invest in this brotherly 
country\" and reaffirmed the Government of Djibouti\'s 
commitment to provide all necessary facilities. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (U) Comment: After the inauguration, Abdurahman Boreh 
hosted a lunch for the visiting entourage and potential 
participants.  The event reportedly secured commitment to the 
project from a number of UAE and Djiboutian business persons. 
 That commitment was conditioned, Post was told, on DPI\'s 
continued management and operation of the DFZ as well as 
Djibouti\'s air and sea ports.  Post notes that DPI has 
managed and operated the International Airport since 2002 and 
the existing Djibouti Port since 2000. 
 
10. (SBU) Comment continued:  Post is increasingly optimistic 
about the economic possibilities for Djibouti as a result of 
this project. We also want to share as much information as 
possible about it with American business. ConGen Dubai may 
receive inquiries on this project and we believe DI can 
provide the necessary detail. Much of the activity 
surrounding the DFZ is being driven by Abdurahman Boreh, the 
hard-charging, pragmatic, and results-oriented Djiboutian 
businessman with close ties to President Guelleh.  Boreh is 
frequently in Dubai and owns a residence there. He supports 
the view that the Dubai link will be Djibouti\'s renaissance, 
creating much-needed jobs, investment opportunities and 
economic diversification. On job creation, the lingering 
question is whether the skill sets of Djibouti\'s work force 
will be sufficient to take advantage of job opportunities 
created by the DFZ or by the Doraleh port project. End 
comment.

SUBJECT: PLOTTING A FUTURE FOR THE ETHIOPIA-DJIBOUTI RAILWAY 
 
1. (U) Ahmed Dualeh, Regional and Commercial Director in 
Djibouti of the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway, told Ambassador 
that the decision of Djibouti and Ethiopia to privatize the 
railway linking their capitals is well underway. Following a 
tender process to take place next year in 2005, the 
international private sector is expected to assume full 
control of the enterprise by 2006. Dualeh anticipates scant 
participation by local investors in the privatization scheme, 
citing a lack of capital, yet holds the view that the railway 
will be attractive to investors because it can be profitable, 
with adequate rehabilitation. An invitation for participation 
in the railway concession envisions 51 per cent of ownership 
of the railway passing to a single concession holder with 
participation of the Governments of Ethiopia and Djibouti at 
a minimum. The long-term value of the railway will be in the 
ability of Djibouti to be attractive as a transshipment point 
to other African destinations.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
Step One: End the Conflict 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Ahmed Dualeh, Regional and Commercial Director in 
Djibouti of the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway, said the U.S., as 
superpower, must work hard to end the Eritrea-Ethiopia 
conflict as a first step in supporting privatization and 
rehabilitation of the Ethiopia-Djibouti railway.  Doing so 
will minimize opportunities for disruption of the railway\'s 
services once privatization is achieved. Seeing a link 
between Ethiopian and Djiboutian economic development and the 
success of the railway, he is also linking sustained economic 
development with winning the global effort to confront 
terrorism.  \"A hungry man,\" he said, \"is easily influenced by 
negative forces.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
Step Two:  Seek Private Investors 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) At the inauguration in Djibouti on May 19 of 
Ethiopia\'s new multi-million dollar embassy compound, guests 
were provided a presentation from Swederail consortium 
inviting private investment in the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway 
Company. The consortium pointed out up front the railway\'s 
technical and physical constraints and its inadequacies in 
organization and management.  It cited these and a shortage 
of funds for parts and maintenance as causes of the railway\'s 
decline.  The result has been, it stated, an excessive number 
of locomotives and wagons out of commission and under repair, 
high operational costs, a weak resource base, lack of an 
improved system, and the inability of the railway to compete 
with flexible trucking.  The short-term challenge of the 
railway company, according to the consortium\'s presentation, 
is to find the necessary funding to catch up with the 
maintenance backlog of the railway.  The EU has approved 40 
million euros (USD 48.2 million) to finance rehabilitation of 
the line, which the consortium hopes will be a selling point 
for potential shareholders. 
 
4. (U) The deadline for submission of pre-qualification 
proposals for shares of the Ethiopia-Djibouti railway 
concession was set for May 31,2004.  After May 31, 
pre-qualified parties would be invited to submit their 
technical proposals for evaluation.  Tender documents would 
be sent no later than June 30 with technical proposals 
submitted by September 17.  After that, parties with 
satisfactory technical proposals would be invited to submit 
financial proposals and the final negotiation and signing of 
a concession agreement with the winner would take place by 
June 2005.  Management of the railroad under the concession 
agreement would commence September 2005, with the major 
shareholder given at least 51 per cent of shares.  The 
participation of the Ethiopian and Djiboutian governments 
would be minimal, according to the consortium\'s presentation. 
Issues of personnel and redundancy are among many other 
issues that will need to be addressed as the process of 
privatization moves forward. 
 
------------------------------ 
Step Three: Regain Lost Ground 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) France began construction of the Ethiopia-Djibouti 
railway in 1897.  It is one of the oldest in Africa and the 
most direct link from the Red Sea to Addis Ababa.  It is a 
meter-gauged single-track line of 781 kilometers of which 681 
kilometers are in Ethiopia.  According to Dualeh, Dire Dawa 
is the central station for operation of the line, hosts its 
maintenance workshops and employs most of the railway\'s labor 
force.  In 1981, the French share in what ultimately became 
the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Company, was taken over by 
Djibouti, creating a 50-50 joint commercial venture between 
Ethiopia and Djibouti.  Headquarters are located in Ethiopia 
and the Djibouti office is organized as a branch of the 
headquarters office. Management of the railway, however, is 
divided 50-50 between the two states, with  chairmanship 
rotating yearly between them. Current chair is Ethiopia, with 
Djibouti\'s Minister of Transport assuming the honors in 2005. 
 The railway\'s General Manager is Ethiopian and its Deputy 
Manager, who also resides in Addis Ababa, is Djiboutian. 
Director of Finance of the railway, according to Dualeh, is 
Ethiopian, as well as its Director of Human Resources.  Both 
are based in Addis Ababa.  The Technical Director of the 
railway is Djiboutian and he is based in Djibouti.  The 
railway\'s Transport and Commercial Directors are also 
Djiboutian and are based in Djibouti. 
 
6. (U)  Over the years, Dualeh said, the railway company has 
been caught up in the political and economic policies of 
Ethiopia and Djibouti and has declined in influence.  One 
hundred kilometers of track are badly in need of repair. In 
addition, the 1970s emphasis on the trade route by road from 
Assab in Eritrea to Addis Ababa exacerbated the railway\'s 
decline.  Commercial travel by railway to Ethiopia from 
Djibouti is currently less than 7 percent of total exports 
from Djibouti to Ethiopia, according to Dualeh.  He said the 
railway is not currently in a position, because of its poor 
condition -- including rolling stock and tracks -- to compete 
with the road, yet it could enhance Djibouti\'s attractiveness 
as a transshipment point to other African destinations. The 
railway currently has 14 locomotives, 442 wagons and 27 
passenger coaches.  Not all are operational at this time. 
The existing line capacity is about 6 trains per day per 
direction and carries approximately 800,000 tons of goods per 
year. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (U) Comment:  At the same time that Djibouti is supporting 
privatization of the railway, it is proceeding on other 
fronts to secure commercial investments that would enable 
Djibouti to become a vital transshipment point for other 
parts of Africa. If projects such as an oil pipeline from 
Djibouti\'s new port at Doraleh to Dire Dawa or Addis Ababa 
are completed, or road improvements confirm trucking as the 
preferred means of transport, the role of the railway could 
remain marginal.  The longer it takes to make the railway a 
vital alternative to other means of transport, and the longer 
the region remains unstable, the more difficult will be the 
railway\'s path out of marginalization. This point is sure to 
loom large with potential shareholders. End comment.

SUBJECT: THORNY ISSUES RAISED AT 27TH ANNIVERSARY 
CELEBRATION OF DJIBOUTI\'S ARMED FORCES 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (U) Summary:  June 6 marked the 27th anniversary of the 
creation of Djibouti\'s armed forces.  On the occasion, Chief 
of Defense, General Fathi Ahmed Houssein, addressed the 
troops with remarks that raised lingering thorny issues of 
adequate housing, health services, compensation and promotion 
that continue to affect troop morale and job satisfaction in 
a negative way.  The most controversial proposal, and the one 
least likely to be fully implemented, is to deduct from 
salaries of military personnel a set sum of nearly 
one-quarter of salary monthly to fund future housing. End 
summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
Post-Flooding: More Promises 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (U)  In his speech at the 27th anniversary celebration 
June 6 of the founding of Djibouti\'s armed forces, Chief of 
Defense, General Fathi Ahmed Houssein, reiterated his 
condolences to the members of the services who lost family 
members, personal effects and homes during the floods which 
had taken place in Djibouti two months prior, almost to the 
day.  He said his command takes the cases of these 
individuals seriously and that assistance would be 
distributed to them \"without delay.\"  He also told the troops 
that \"a study had been undertaken which would lay out 
possibilities for their re-housing,\" which has not yet been 
resolved. 
 
------------------------- 
Imposed Contribution Plan 
------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Perhaps most controversial among the General\'s remarks 
during the anniversary celebration was his outline to the 
troops, for the first time, of a proposed plan to retain from 
their salaries on a monthly basis, the sum of 10,000 
Djiboutian Francs (USD 56, out of an average salary of 40,000 
Djiboutian Francs (USD 226) to fund, over several years, a 
financing plan for military housing.  No other details were 
provided, although General Fathi remarked that implementation 
of the reserve funding was \"on hold\" until a personalized 
contract establishing duration and terms could be 
established. (Comment:  Commander of French Armed Forces in 
Djibouti, General Gerard Pons, told Ambassador and USLO 
during a meeting on June 9, that this proposed plan was a 
shock and had stirred much grumbling from the military rank 
and file as soon as announced. End comment) 
 
------------------------- 
Praising \"Transformation\" 
------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Among the list of accomplishments of the military over 
the past year, cited by General Fathi, were the following: 
 
-- creation of new regiments, including the Rapid Action 
Regiment, with added missions, including a new focus on the 
anti-terrorist struggle; 
 
-- increase in the capacity of the Artillery Regiment to 
optimize its fire power and mobility; 
 
-- enlargement of the capacity of the naval unit operating 
along Djibouti\'s maritime coasts, including equipping it with 
a high-speed medical motorboat to decrease evacuation time to 
sources of treatment; 
 
-- progress of the Demining Company and the declaration in 
January 2004 of Djibouti as mine-free; 
 
-- improvement of health structures of the Djibouti Armed 
Forces generally, for the benefit of Djibouti\'s citizens; 
 
-- the planned construction of a military hospital which 
would concentrate all military health structures into a 
single enclosure. According to General Fathi, this project is 
\"under discussion\" and \"in design phase;\" 
 
-- achievement in the future of a mixed modern garrison for 
officers that will also provide leisure space for the mental 
and physical well-being of soldiers; 
 
-- in Human Resources, continuation of training programs that 
currently have placed 110 trainees in 20 countries. There are 
also plans for additional training of pilots of aircraft and 
helicopters. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Acknowledging Problems in Benefits and Promotions 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5. (U) General Fathi spoke of a commission that \"is being set 
up\" to look at issues such as loans and death benefits for 
soldiers. He also told the assembled soldiers that \"I am not 
unaware of the unease of non-commissioned officers who await 
formal regularization of the grading of officers.  A 
commission will be designed, which will define methods of 
promotion.  The thorny problem of promotion freezes will 
know, I hope, a happy outcome at the end of the year.\" 
General Fathi went on to say that normal promotions had been 
delayed but that a list of promotions would be released 
\"before the end of the year or by the beginning of next year.\" 
 
-------- 
Comment 
-------- 
 
6. (C) During a meeting with Ambassador in mid-April, General 
Fathi expressed his unhappiness with the pace of U.S. 
provision of defense equipment promised and in the pipeline 
for Djibouti under Foreign Military Financing (FMF). He 
sought the Ambassador\'s help in quickening the pace of 
provisioning, so that the process of acquiring equipment is 
shortened.  In the General\'s words, \"security cannot wait\" on 
the slow process. He also asked for additional equipment, 
including a radar for joint use by the U.S. and Djiboutian 
militaries, and for an additional USD 100,000 annually to 
fund maintenance of Djibouti\'s Demining Company.  Ambassador 
took advantage of the opportunity of the April 25 Chiefs of 
Mission Conference hosted by the Combined Joint Task 
Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), to put Colonel Osman Nur 
Soubagleh, Commander of the Djiboutian Army Corps of 
Engineers, in contact with visiting DAS Theresa Whelan for 
further discussion. 
 
7. (C) Djibouti\'s military has other internal problems that 
require priority focus. The lingering issues of promotions, 
benefits, and post-flood assistance for soldiers and their 
families are unresolved.  Indeed, General Fathi has 
approached USLO for assistance in re-supplying the military 
and its troops with some of their flood losses.  It will be a 
challenge to meet these requirements in a timely manner, even 
if subsequently approved.  Moreover, the Armed Forces of 
Djibouti (FAD) are also experiencing difficulty in meeting 
payroll requirements.  Recent cuts in a food supplement for 
FAD service members proved so unpopular as to cause strikes 
at several military bases.  This new proposal to fund what 
many in the FAD deem to be a government obligation, is not 
likely to fare better.  End comment.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (S) This cable reflects the views of the Ambassador, 
Office of Regional Affairs, Regional Security Office, United 
States Liaison Office and the Commander of the Combined Joint 
Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA). 
 
2. (S) Post appreciates the Department\'s concern outlined in 
Ref A and wishes to clarify any misunderstanding created by 
Ref B.  Under the Ref B proposal, all counter-terrorism (CT) 
programs in Djibouti are not being placed under the military. 
 Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) training and programs under 
the Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP) will continue as 
currently operating.  Additionally, no new programs are 
envisioned or requested by Post.  The Djiboutian military has 
requested, and will receive, two Blanket Order Training (BOT) 
cases as part of its Border and Coastal Security programs. 
Post will use these BOT cases to purchase a variety of 
training that supports the stated goals of the Border and 
Coastal security programs.  Post would not, and could not, 
direct the Djiboutian Government (DJG) to pursue any 
particular course of action. 
 
3. (S) That said, the Djiboutian military (including the 
Gendarmerie, which falls under its jurisdiction) has 
approached Post and CJTF-HOA on several occasions outlining 
the need, and the current lack of capacity within the 
Djiboutian military, to support and augment other agencies of 
the Djiboutian government in the event of a terrorist act. 
Post and CJTF-HOA have advised the DJG that specific training 
on CT for the military cannot be pursued until the role of 
the Djiboutian military in CT activities is clearly defined. 
A recent ATA program review noted that the single greatest 
inhibitor to effective CT operations in Djibouti was lack of 
coordination among the various security agencies at the 
national level. We have stated to the DJG the importance of 
clearly defining the roles of its military organizations in 
support of CT operations.  With such coordination, and a 
clear delineation of roles, the military could receive 
training that would be in support of current U.S.-sponsored 
CT programs. 
 
4. (S) Post emphasizes that Ref B is not a request for 
additional programs or monies.  BOT cases are standard tools 
of the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) system and Djibouti\'s 
BOT cases will be used to support the goals of the East 
Africa Counter-terrorism Initiative as they are currently 
stated.  Post agrees with the Department that greater 
coordination among elements involved in CT activities is 
valuable.  If the DJG creates a national CT Task Force that 
includes portions of the Djiboutian military, post will 
inform the Department.

REF: DJIBOUTI 795 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Seven youths from the Arhiba neighborhood were 
arrested on the afternoon of 8 June, following protests 
against hiring practices at Djibouti\'s new Doraleh Port 
Facility and Free Zone.  These arrests were the subject of a 
second day of protests on 9 June. 
 
2. (U) Prime Minister, Dileita Mohammed Dileita, speaking 
before Parliament on 10 June said, these seven arrests were 
related to several graffiti messages that appeared on a 
public wall during the protests and that had possible 
terrorist connotations.  The Prime Minister stated that the 
arrests were not aimed at harming the community but rather 
were made as a precaution against what the government sees as 
\"outside influences\" seeking to use the youth.   He also said 
in his remarks that these graffiti messages and the force 
behind the protests needed to be investigated \"in order to 
protect friends and guests in Djibouti.\"  (Note: This comment 
refers to the French, American and coalition military 
presence in Djibouti.)  He told Parliament that these 
protests incite tribal hatred and that the Djiboutian 
government would not tolerate threats. 
 
3. (U) Four of the seven arrested claimed responsibility for 
the graffiti, the other three denied involvement.  Those that 
confessed were sent to Gabode prison pending full 
investigation.  The three who denied involvement were 
temporarily released on 12 June, pending a full 
investigation. 
 
3. (C) Comment: Pol/Econ and Econ FSN drove by the wall on 
which the graffiti had been scrawled.  The messages were 
heavily anti-government, anti-Guelleh and anti-the recently 
inaugurated Free Zone. Some of the messages included: \"The 
Free Zone is a Presidential Boutique,\" \"IOG (Ismael Omar 
Guelleh) profits, steals from the citizens, we will respond 
otherwise this time,\" \"IOG - the people are not fools, stop 
dreaming,\" \"Arhiba is united in misery against injustice and 
oppression.\"  Most of the graffiti messages had a similar 
content and did not explicitly indicate terrorist intentions. 
 The one message on the wall that is more likely to be 
construed as a terrorist threat stated: \"We like sacrifice, 
we have martyrs and we have terrorists.\"  This message is 
more likely aimed at eliciting a sharp government response 
rather than indicating anti-foreign sentiment.

SUBJECT: EACTI: PRIORITIZATION OF DJIBOUTI CT PROGRAMS 
 
REF: STATE 112122 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE 
FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) In response to reftel, Embassy Djibouti sections and 
agencies reviewed East Africa Counter-Terrorism Initiative 
(EACTI) objectives and supporting programs.  Embassy provides 
the following list of objectives and supporting programs in 
order of priority: 
 
a. (C) EACTI objective - Limit Freedom of Movement to 
Transnational Terrorists. 
 
(i) (C) Coastal Security.  Given that al-Qaida and other 
terrorists are transiting the Red Sea to the Horn of Africa 
and beyond, we propose developing a coastal security program 
for Djibouti that will bolster its capacity to deny 
terrorists freedom of movement in the littoral waters 
surrounding Djibouti.  This program will include capacity 
building for surveillance and interdiction of maritime 
traffic in the region.  Program source - Foreign Military 
Financing. 
 
(ii) (C) Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP).  TIP assists 
the Government of Djibouti (GODJ) in securing its borders by 
limiting terrorists\' capabilities to cross international 
boundaries to stage terrorist attacks and escape undetected. 
Through a series of networked computers and peripherals 
installed at airport entry and departure points, transit 
lounges and key sea and land border points, the TIP will 
bolster Djibouti\'s ability to identify arriving or transiting 
passengers suspected of having terrorist connections. 
Additionally, it will allow the GODJ to determine quickly who 
may be hastily leaving the country after an incident. 
 
(iii) (C) Safe Skies For Africa (SSFA).  The SSFA program 
seeks to improve sub-Saharan aviation infrastructure by 
targeting the now seven selected \"hub\" countries for advanced 
technical assistance in meeting the international aviation 
safety and security standards of the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO).  Djibouti has regular flights 
coming from and going to Hargeisa, Yemen, Dubai, Addis Ababa, 
Asmara and Paris.  Djibouti\'s airport currently primarily 
serves military uses, but would like to expand its passenger 
travel.  New economic ventures, such as the Doraleh Port, may 
lead to an increase in passengers and freight.  If Djibouti\'s 
air freight and passenger services do not meet current safety 
standards, it could deter incoming investors.  Increased 
training and security equipment at the airport can benefit 
Djibouti\'s economic performance at the same time that it 
ensures that all routes into Djibouti are secured and safe. 
 
(iv) (S) Border Security.  Djibouti shares a border with 
Somalia.  This same border is only 12 kms from the only U.S. 
military base in Africa.  It is critical to Djiboutian and 
U.S. interests to improve the ability of Djibouti to monitor 
and patrol its frontiers.  Recent intelligence reports 
indicate al-Qaida is operating along the Djibouti-Somalia 
border, portending critical implications for U.S. force 
protection.  Proposed program would include training as well 
as transportation and communications equipment.  Program 
source - Foreign Military Financing. 
 
(v) (C) Anti-Terrorism Training Assistance (ATA).  The ATA 
program is focused on enhancing the policing skills of GODJ 
security services to prevent or combat a terrorist action. 
Through a series of training programs geared specifically at 
countering terrorism, the ATA program increases a country\'s 
ability to defend itself against terrorism while providing 
greater security for U.S. personnel.  Special courses in 
airport and border security bolster the GODJ\'s ability to 
control its borders and enforce immigration law. 
 
b. (U) EACTI Objective - Counter Extremist Influence. 
 
(i) (U) Public Diplomacy Program.  Public diplomacy program 
activities influence Djiboutian, French and regional public 
opinion and decision-making consistent with U.S. national 
interests.  Increased interaction between the American and 
Djiboutian communities fosters goodwill and provides a venue 
for promoting programs and values that counter extremist 
influences.  Encouraging and framing Djibouti\'s success as a 
Muslim, Somali-speaking, American ally is key to the success 
of EACTI as well as our overall Mission Plan.  This takes 
many forms including distribution of books and other written 
materials supporting EACTI goals, increased person-to-person 
and cross-cultural interaction and television and radio 
broadcasts. 
 
(ii) (U) Self-Help.  The Self-Help program\'s goal is to 
encourage communities to better their own situation, while 
improving the U.S. relationship with host country nationals. 
Self-Help is one of the most visible and direct forms of U.S. 
assistance.  Embassy Djibouti has had more than 30 successful 
community development projects over the past two years. 
These projects go beyond giving financial assistance to the 
government.  They provide local communities with activities 
for children, places to study and tutor, vocational training, 
better resources for farming and greater access to water. 
The inaugurations of successful projects and programs have 
great impact on the hearts and minds of Djiboutians, more so 
than grants to the government. 
 
(iii) (U) Democracy and Human Rights Fund (DHRF).  The DHRF 
is an annual allotment from USAID that gives Posts the 
ability to fund small, short-term projects proposed by the 
government and private secret groups to promote human rights, 
good governance, political pluralism and democracy.  The 
funds have been especially useful in Djibouti for promoting 
awareness in the public sector and government awareness of 
human rights.  DHRF funds have also been vital in past 
legislative elections and in encouraging rights of the child. 
 
(iv) (C) Voice of America (VOA).  Radio and television 
broadcasts are the most effective means of reaching a mass 
audience in this largely illiterate country.  They further 
American values and goals consistent with EACTI and the 
Mission Performance Plan.  In addition to their shared 
culture, Djibouti\'s close proximity to Somalia, southern 
Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen makes it a natural launching point 
for programs that will reach across the borders of this small 
state.  For example, our current VOA feeds are in English 
(VOA) and Arabic (Radio Sawaa) and cover an arc from Sudan to 
Saudi Arabia. 
 
c. (C) EACTI Objective - Enhance Regional Counter-Terrorism 
and Law Enforcement Capabilities. 
 
(i) (U) International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA). 
Although ILEA is designed to address international crime, its 
focus on developing mid-level management for law enforcement 
and other criminal justice officials, is critical to the 
overall ability of the GODJ police force to prevent or 
counter a terrorist act.  The ability of the host nation to 
deploy an effective and professional police force is 
detrimental to countering terrorism in a region ripe with 
political instability and deteriorating communities. 
 
(ii) (U) The ATA program complements ILEA by providing 
specialized training in fields to which the GODJ would not 
normally be exposed.  Courses in post-blast investigation, 
senior crisis management, VIP protection and officer survival 
are just some of the courses that have helped bring the GODJ 
security services into a new era of law enforcement. 
 
(iii) (U) International Military Education and Training 
(IMET).  The IMET program serves to professionalize the 
Djiboutian military, expose Djiboutian officers to the United 
States and make the Djiboutian military more interoperable 
with the U.S. military. 
 
(iv) (U) Counter-Terrorism Fellowship.  This additional 
funding for education and training is very useful to continue 
the professionalization of the Djiboutian military and expose 
senior military and civilian leaders to U.S. strategic 
thinking in relation to the GWOT. 
 
2. (U) Post is aware that future funding of all programs will 
be reflective of the national interest as it evolves. 
However, given Djibouti\'s strategic location, key role in 
regional stability and high level of support for the U.S.-led 
war on terrorism, we believe most programs in Djibouti should 
be maintained at current funding levels. 
 
3. (U) Shortfalls and Additional Requirements. 
 
a. (C) Coastal Security.  Current FMF funding will allow the 
Djiboutian Coast Guard to procure boats for coastal patrol, 
interdiction and boarding operations.  Additionally, Djibouti 
will be able to construct small naval stations in the remote 
regions to ensure continual military presence in the littoral 
waters.  However, Djibouti\'s coastal security program 
requires radar to be effective.  Current FMF funding is not 
adequate to procure the necessary radar. 
 
b. (C) Somali Language Broadcasts.  Somalia is a known harbor 
for extremists.  We believe that increasing our Somali 
language output, especially through VOA, would be an 
effective means of reaching an important target population. 
VOA currently lacks the transmitter to reach Somalia, 
although the current station is amenable to and appropriately 
placed for such an addition.  A Somali language feed need not 
represent a change in policy as Djibouti is largely 
Somaliphone and would be a consumer of said products; 
therefore, such a feed would not qualify as direct 
engagement.  That said, the Department of State currently 
produces few, if any, Somali language products. 
 
c. (C) The training programs designed for the GODJ, as 
implemented through ATA and ILEA, are without a doubt one of 
the best dollar-for-dollar investments the U.S. Government 
(USG) has in countering terrorism in the Horn of Africa. 
Unfortunately, training is only a portion of what the 
Djiboutian security services require to maintain a 
professional police force.  The skills acquired through USG 
training can only go so far without the use of proper 
equipment.  The GODJ suffers from a depleted economy and is 
unable to procure adequate equipment for the security 
services.  Items such as handcuffs, radios, ballistic vests, 
riot batons, shields, helmets, ammunition for training and 
many other basic tools of the trade in their inventory are 
either obsolete or non existent.  The GODJ Security Services 
are in dire need of physical resources that are commensurate 
with the level of training received.  It would be in the best 
interest of the USG\'s counter terrorism program to provide 
either the actual resources or a monetary grant to procure 
essential equipment.

letter to Ambassador in thanks for the assistance provided by 
the U.S. Government during the devastating floods in April. 
Below is the transcribed text of the letter. 
 
2.  Begin text. 
 
The Minister for Health to Her Excellency Madam Ambassador of 
the United States 
Copy to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International 
Cooperation, in charge of relations with the Parliament 
 
I have the honor to transmit to you the thanks of the people 
of Djibouti and of my Department following the assistance your 
country provided for the flood disaster of April 2004. 
 
We were appreciative of your personal participation and those 
responsible at USAID to quickly answer the call for aid from 
the Ministry of Health. Thanks to your support, the potential 
for epidemics has been avoided and the health centers have 
been able to deal effectively with cases of diarrhea or other 
illnesses related to the catastrophe of last April. 
 
Lastly, I request that you convey our gratitude to your 
Government. 
 
I ask your acceptance, Excellence, of our respectful 
salutations.

1. (S) Post convened a meeting of the Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) on 17 June, 2004 to review threat information 
as outlined in REFTEL and recent threat reporting from other 
sources.  The EAC discussed the potential of attacks on 
western targets and the addition of needed security measures 
to mitigate the threat.  Potential targets in Djibouti 
include the Embassy, the U.S. Military Base Camp Lemonier, 
and frequented establishments in the downtown area.  In 
addition, the EAC addressed the potential risk of personal 
attacks to American and other Western civilians as they 
relate to the trend of recent attacks in Saudi Arabia. 
 
2. (S) The core EAC was composed of the Ambassador, RSO, RAO, 
USLO, Force Protection Officer (FPO) and U.S. Military J2X. 
The contents of REFTEL were discussed in detail and all 
parties agreed that current physical security measures at the 
Embassy remain sufficient to deter or disrupt an attack. 
Mission personnel have been at a heightened level for a 
period of time and are carrying out appropriate personal 
security measures.  In addition, the Ambassador held a 
special staff meeting to address the need for greater 
vigilance and security awareness. 
 
3. (SBU) Appropriate Military representatives from Camp 
Lemonier are aware of the current threat and will take 
measures IAW their SOPs.  US Military elements are also 
coordinating with the host nation and the French Forces in 
Djibouti (FFD) who have a formal defense agreement with the 
Government of Djibouti. 
 
4. (S/NF) Recent threat reporting indicates a spike in 
terrorist activity that continues to identify the Horn of 
Africa as a potential target.  U.S. Military representatives 
have been in negotiations with the Host Nation to implement 
active and passive measures to mitigate an attack against 
aircraft landing or taking off from Djibouti International 
Airport. In addition, Force Protection Officers from Camp 
Lemonier are currently addressing the threat of personal 
attacks on U.S. Military Personnel.  Several options are 
being considered to include establishing a Surveillance 
Detection Team to monitor pedestrian and vehicular activity 
surrounding the base. 
 
5. (S) The EAC agreed that due to the general threat of 
attacks against Americans world wide and recent threat 
information, it would be prudent to reiterate the need for 
vigilance and personal security measures to the American 
community.  ConOff has forwarded the Departments world wide 
warning to all wardens and members of the community and has 
reiterated the need to maintain a low profile and strongly 
consider postponing activities that involve large groups of 
Americans or Westerners.  The Ambassador will continue to 
raise US security concerns officially with the Government of 
Djibouti.

1. (U) SUMMARY: Pol/Econ met at Embassy Djibouti June 9 with 
Dr. Omar Duhod, Somaliland national, based in London, and a 
premier advocate for recognition.  Dr. Duhod requested a 
courtesy call with Embassy Djibouti on his way to Hargeisa. 
Pol/Econ and Dr. Duhod discussed the current situation and 
future of Somaliland.  Duhod also put forth several arguments 
for bringing in aid and investment to Somaliland. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Dr. Omar Duhod is a legally blind psychiatrist, of 
Somaliland origin, who lives in London and works part time at 
universities while working towards Somaliland recognition. 
He travels to Hargeisa about every three months to coordinate 
and meet with Somaliland officials.  Duhod, a former military 
doctor, was one of the first to start the Somaliland 
independence movement twenty years ago.  His demeanor was 
somewhat self-promotional but his opinions appeared very 
informed and positive for the future of Somaliland.  Duhod\'s 
main argument for U.S. recognition of Somaliland was the 
strategic position of the territory\'s coastline bordering the 
Arabian peninsula and the added advantage Somaliland could 
give to U.S. efforts in the war on terrorism. 
 
3. (C) When asked if Somaliland was aggressively seeking 
recognition from African neighbors, Duhod replied 
rhetorically \"how could it gain recognition from 
non-democratically elected governments that don\'t understand 
Somali problems and don\'t want to fix them?\"  Duhod commented 
that Djibouti has been more supportive, recently, of the 
Somaliland government.  He cited President Guelleh\'s March 
2004 interview with BBC Somalia in which Guelleh commented 
that Somaliland is a state built from nothing, and without 
foreign support.  \"There is no reason to ignore it.\"  Duhod 
also cited Djibouti\'s decision to accept Somaliland passports 
as positive. 
 
4. (C) On the Somali Peace Talks in Nairobi, Duhod stated 
that if Somaliland is forced to go back to Somalia, there 
will be civil war.  Somalis in Nairobi are those that 
committed atrocities, he added.  He also said that the union 
of Somaliland and Somalia after colonial independence was not 
legal because there was no formal act of unification. 
 
5. (C) Duhod was upbeat about the governing capability and 
democratic character of the elected government of Somaliland. 
 He asked Pol/Econ to consider whether economic assistance to 
Somaliland civil society would be possible in order to 
bolster the economy in Somaliland.  Duhod said the economy 
has been growing steadily but still needs much work, 
especially outside interest.  Pol/Econ said she would look 
into forms of assistance that might be available to community 
organizations, as well as other forms of commercial 
assistance and share that information with Duhod.

1. (C) On 8 June, Houssein Ahmed Farah, journalist for the 
opposition newspaper Le Renouveau and brother to famed 
opposition leader Daher Ahmed Farah - jailed several times in 
2003 for political reasons, was arrested after he failed to 
stop for the First Lady of Djibouti\'s convoy traveling 
towards the Presidency.  Farah was on his return from 
covering the protests in the Arhiba neighborhood (reftel) 
when he encountered the First Lady\'s convoy.  Farah, in court 
appearances, indicated that he did not see the convoy coming 
and was distracted by passengers, which caused him to 
continue into the intersection and the path of the convoy. 
Farah then reportedly immediately reversed and removed 
himself from the path of the convoy as ordered. The arrest 
was said to have been ordered by the First Lady, Kadra 
Mahamoud, after she arrived at the Presidency.  Farah was 
charged with \"endangering the First Lady\'s convoy\" and was 
detained at the Police Station until his arraignment on 12 
June.  The judge in the case gave Farah \"detention 
provisoire\" (temporary detention pending a trial) and sent 
him to Gabode prison. Farah\'s case was given expedited 
treatment and his trial took place 17 June. Farah was found 
not guilty and released. 
 
2. (C) Comment: Farah\'s arrest was reported in 
allAfrica.com\'s June 15th publication, which called it 
\"arbitrary\" and claimed he was held in solitary confinement 
in very poor conditions.  Post cannot confirm this portion of 
the report.  The opposition papers in Djibouti also reported 
the arrest as arbitrary and repression of freedom of the 
press.  Pol/Econ discussed the trial and arrest with Jean 
Paul Noel, President of the Djiboutian League of Human 
Rights.  Noel admitted that it was strange that Farah was 
held in \"detention provisoire,\" as it is not usual for a 
charge of this nature.  However, Noel said he would not be 
writing this up as an arbitrary arrest, because it is not 
entirely clear that it was arbitrary.  Post believes that 
Farah\'s arrest may have been slightly politically motivated 
because of the relation to Daher Ahmed Farah, but does not 
believe it is related to his status a reporter who covered 
the Arhiba demonstrations. End Comment.

1. (C) Pol/Econ delivered demarche, per reftel, to Director 
of Bilateral Relations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
Mohamed Ali Hassan, 21 June, urging the Government of 
Djibouti to publicly denounce the murder of American citizen 
Paul Johnson.  Hassan responded that  the Government of 
Djibouti\'s position on acts of terrorism such as this one is 
very well known, even if it is not regularly publicized. 
 
2. (C) Hassan made clear that the Government of Djibouti 
denounces this type of action, against any civilian American 
or otherwise, as barbaric and unacceptable.  He said Djibouti 
has always been a good friend to and stood with the United 
States against terrorism.  Hassan then asked whether 
Washington was the one asking for a public message. 
 
3. (C) Pol/Econ confirmed that the demarche was by request 
from Washington and the U.S. would like the government\'s 
stance to be public in order to make known that these acts 
are condemned by all nations throughout the world.  Hassan 
commented that the reason press statements are not released 
after each attack of this nature is that the Government of 
Djibouti is not well organized and does not have adequate 
press service to release such statements.  Hassan continued 
that the Government\'s one press attach is currently occupied 
by the Somalia issues in Nairobi.  Nevertheless, Hassan said 
he would bring up the issue of a press release with the 
Minister to see if it could be done. 
 
4. (C) Comment: Embassy is not optimistic the Government of 
Djibouti will take a public stand on the Johnson murder.  Its 
officials have made clear, however, in private comments to 
Embassy officers their personal condemnation of the killing 
of Johnson.  In most cases, this condemnation has been on 
religious grounds.  Ambassador, in her conversations with 
officials, has nevertheless urged a public statement.  End

 1. (U)Summary: With the help of Emirates National Oil 
Company (ENOC), Djibouti is moving ahead with its major port 
construction project at Doraleh. Increasingly seen as the 
future economic lifeline for Djibouti, the port\'s site 
manager, an Indian national of Dubai residency, admits that 
he is under pressure to complete the port two months ahead of 
schedule.  Shifts working day and night are expected to bring 
the project to fruition by November, 2004 vice January, 2005. 
 A primary segment of the port is an oil storage terminal 
facility that includes what ENOC describes as four storage 
tanks for the U.S. Navy.  In addition, the port is expected 
to have the capability to dock and service the largest of 
military vessels.  The port project has its own primarily 
imported labor force, and includes a housing camp with 
sleeping quarters, recreation facilities and meal delivery 
systems to make it self-sustaining.  Dubai has taken the lead 
in development of the project, with the support of key 
Djiboutian businessman Abdurahman Boreh and President Ismail 
Omar Guelleh.  As a result, the port has created high 
expectations for the economic development of Djibouti. Yet 
precise percentages of share ownership in the project remain 
vague, with even Ethiopia expected to take a small share. 
While the port project still has its skeptics, only stability 
in the region would appear to be the more difficult and 
unpredictable hurdle for Doraleh. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) President Guelleh\'s self-proclaimed economic gateway 
to Djibouti\'s prosperity -- its mega oil and container port 
at Doraleh-- is forging ahead at a pace of construction 
intended to bring the project to fruition two months ahead of 
schedule.  Ambassador, Pol/Econ, and Econ assistant made 
their second visit in two months to the port site, located 
seven kilometers from the existing port, to assess progress 
and to meet with the project manager.  Touted as a complement 
to the United Arab Emirates port of Dubai, the new port of 
Doraleh is expected to open Djibouti to markets in the Horn 
of Africa and beyond. 
 
3. (U) Our hosts for a tour and briefing were K.K. Menon, of 
Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), Site Manager for the 
Doraleh project, and Ayanleh Idriss Hassan, Terminal Manager 
for Horizon Ltd., an ENOC subsidiary.  Horizon, which will 
operate Doraleh\'s oil terminal, focuses primarily on the 
Singaporian and African markets for ENOC. ENOC established 
Horizon, according to Idriss, in order to consolidate and 
independently develop ENOC\'s oil and chemicals terminalling 
business globally. 
 
-------------- 
Ties that Bind 
-------------- 
 
4. (U) The port of Doraleh is the brain-child of Abdurahman 
Boreh, a prominent and self-assured Djiboutian businessman, 
who successfully convinced President Guelleh of the merits of 
taking advantage of the single income outlet available to 
resource-poor Djibouti -- that of services.  He began by 
establishing a partnership with Dubai investors and by 
encouraging the President to bring in Dubai Ports 
International to manage its existing port and international 
airport.  Dubai Ports International is investing USD 300 
million to develop the container terminal in Doraleh while 
ENOC is financing the port\'s oil terminal at a cost of USD 
130 million.  The port will include an oil terminal, whose 
construction began in June 2003, oil storage facilities, an 
oil refinery, a container port, a Free Zone and an industrial 
area with power station and desalinization plant.  Partners 
in the Doraleh project will also construct, at their own 
expense, a new road from Doraleh port to the national road 
linking Djibouti to Ethiopia. The Doraleh port, to be 
completed by January 2005 and to be made operational by May, 
2005, is not expected to replace or adversely affect Dubai 
port activities, according to Menon. It\'s primary focus will 
be Africa. 
 
---------------- 
Status report 
---------------- 
 
5. (U) Menon told us that the port\'s \"clients\" have applied 
pressure on ENOC to complete construction of the port ahead 
of schedule.  He is now on target to complete the project in 
November 2004, vice January 2005.  To remain on track, Menon 
is preparing to put in place a lighting arrangement at the 
port site that will allow night construction.  He also stated 
that \"the U.S. Navy\" is pushing for quick completion of the 
project in order to activate the four oil storage tanks set 
aside for the Navy\'s use.  According to Menon, of the U.S. 
Navy\'s four storage tanks at Doraleh, two have dimensions 20 
meters high x 47 meters deep and two have dimensions 20 
meters high x 37 meters deep.  All tanks will be equipped 
with a special membrane to prevent oil leakage and pollution 
of the soil beneath the storage tanks.  A total of nine 
storage tanks are currently under construction and we were 
shown the extent of progress on tanks reserved for the U.S. 
Navy. (Note: Embassy is still trying to confirm a U.S. Navy 
contractual engagement for Doraleh with ENOC. End note)  Oil 
companies currently operating in Djibouti, such as Exxon 
Mobil, Menon said, would be free to lease remaining tanks in 
the pool from Horizon.  (Note:  Mobil, Total and Shell have 
been informed of the Government of Djibouti\'s intent to close 
the companies\' existing storage tanks at the current port as 
soon as the new Doraleh facility is on line. See Ref B. End 
note)  When completed, the Doraleh oil terminal will have the 
capability to store 240,000 cubic meters of clean petroleum 
products, including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and kerosene, 
as well as fuel oil, chemicals, edible oil and liquefied 
petroleum gas. 
 
6. (U) Ambassador asked about the potential of the port to 
allow docking at port side of large U.S. military vessels. 
Menon responded that the Doraleh port would have a depth of 
28-30 meters and that the extent of the causeway into the sea 
would allow these vessels to acquire maximum security cordons 
to meet U.S. military standards and requirements. 
 
7. (U) On challenges encountered in the quest to speed up the 
project, Menon said he had had some difficulties with the 
causeway that will service the oil terminal because of a 
delay in delivery of necessary materials, due to the vacation 
season in Europe.  ENOC also faced problems with a local 
company contracted to crush stones for the project.  The 
company stopped its services temporarily in a dispute with 
Menon and ENOC over payment of \"royalties\" the company said 
it was obliged to make. Menon said ENOC refused to pay the 
royalties and contacted President Guelleh directly in the 
matter.  The matter was quickly resolved with no royalties 
being charged and services resumed. 
 
------------------ 
Manpower Resources 
------------------ 
 
8. (U) According to Menon, 322 local staff and 68 expatriates 
are currently working at the Doraleh site.  The number of 
expatriates is expected to reach as high as 340 in the short 
term because of ENOC\'s inability to recruit Djiboutians with 
the necessary skill sets to perform some of the 
highly-skilled jobs that the port requires, such as welding. 
Djiboutians employed are working primarily as laborers, 
drivers and security guards.  Menon blamed the cultural habit 
of chewing \"khat\" for the paucity of qualified workers.  He 
also spoke about a work ethic that discouraged Djiboutians 
from accepting jobs that required more than three hours of 
physical activity daily. (Note: At the site, shifts begin at 
0830 and end at 1830, with a two-hour lunch break. Use of 
\"khat\" is strictly forbidden during work hours. End note.) 
When questioned about the recent Afar demonstrations over 
hiring for Doraleh and the new Free Zone, (reftel A) Menon 
seemed unaware of the demonstrations and responded that 
tribal issues, in any case, were not within ENOC\'s purview. 
(Note: There are indications Boreh has assumed the role of de 
facto labor broker in local hiring for the Doraleh work to 
avoid such conflict. End note). 
 
9. (U)  Construction of housing for expatriate workers -- of 
Malaysian, Indian, Filipino and other origins -- at the 
project site is nearly complete.  It consists of 
self-contained modular living quarters with private 
bathrooms.  The compound has its own source of electricity, 
chillers for cooling, and a huge and modern kitchen. 
Currently, expatriate workers are housed half in a hotel in 
town and half at the completed portion of the camp.  All will 
continue to receive their meals at a local hotel, with 
specialized foods geared to nationality, until the kitchen at 
the Doraleh camp is complete. There are no housing provisions 
for Djiboutian workers. 
 
------------------------ 
Sorting Out Partnerships 
------------------------ 
 
10. (U) On our questions regarding the role and percentage of 
holdings in the port by investors, and specifically by 
Abdurahman Boreh, Menon declined to comment.  (Note: Boreh 
told Ambassador he owned 40 per cent of the Doraleh project, 
with ENOC owning the remaining 60 percent.  Some place 
Boreh\'s holdings at 20 percent, with the rest of the 40 per 
cent share divided equally between the Government of Djibouti 
and President Ismail Omar Guelleh. In addition, at the May 
18-20 meeting in Djibouti of the Ethiopia-Djibouti Economic 
and Commercial Ministerial Working Group, Ethiopia requested 
land at Doraleh to invest in and build a petroleum depot to 
accept petroleum products in transit to Ethiopia. The 
Djiboutian side explained to the Ethiopians that, for 
security reasons, it preferred to place petroleum activities 
at Doraleh in the hands of ENOC.  After much discussion of 
this issue, Djibouti rescinded and agreed to include Ethiopia 
in the project because of the two countries\' \"strategic 
partnership.\"  It is unclear if Ethiopia will follow through 
on its request and also unclear as to which partner would 
provide the percentage to Ethiopia.  End note). 
 
11. (U) Menon told us that when studies were made a few years 
ago about the feasibility of the Doraleh project, \"even 
President Guelleh did not believe it could materialize.\" 
ENOC believed in it from the beginning, he said proudly. The 
location is good as it is close to the sea with minimum need 
to reclaim land to build the port\'s infrastructure, he added. 
 
 
------------------------ 
More Investments Planned 
------------------------ 
 
12. (U) Menon commented that ENOC also planned to build a new 
hotel \"of high standing\" near the beach of Doraleh.  It will 
complement, he explained, the Haramous housing development 
project recently contracted by the Government of Djibouti to 
a Saudi investor. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (U) Comment: Post understands that the U.S. Trade and 
Development Agency (TDA) will likely fund U.S. company 
Han-Padron\'s feasibility study and full market forecast for 
all aspects of the Doraleh project and for a Master Plan for 
all port sectors of Djibouti. (Ref C)  Post believes this is 
a project worthy of investment.  While the port project still 
has its skeptics, Embassy fully expects it to be successful 
and is confident the port can open new and broad commercial 
opportunities for U.S. business.  With Dubai taking a 
pervasive lead role financially in the future of Djibouti, 
and with a government increasingly affirming its commitment 
to necessary internal social and economic reforms, only 
stability in the region would appear to be the more difficult 
and unpredictable hurdle for Doraleh.   End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  Mobil is enroute to a likely showdown with 
the Government of Djibouti over compensation and other issues 
arising from Djibouti\'s announcement that Mobil must close, 
on environmental grounds, its existing oil storage and 
distribution facility at Djibouti port by May, 2005.  Mobil 
will not accept the Government\'s requirement that it move its 
operations at that time to new storage facilities at Doraleh 
port, now under construction, and says it will close down its 
Djibouti operations.  Mobil does not support the view that a 
sound customer base exists to justify the move.  It also 
states that the move would require Mobil to join forces with 
a prime competitor, Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), 
which it is unwilling to do.  It also insists the U.S. 
military based in Djibouti has not helped Mobil by choosing 
to purchase its fuel needs from competing giant Total of

oil terminal facilities at the existing port of Djibouti in 
May 2005.  (Ref B) The three companies were offered the 
chance to relocate their services to Doraleh port, now under 
construction, which would involve leasing tanks from port 
shareholder Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), through its 
subsidiary Horizon Ltd. 
 
3. (C) Adam shared with Ambassador Mobil\'s official response 
to the May 10 letter, cleared by Mobil\'s lawyers in Brussels 
and Paris.  Addressed to the Minister of Transports, Elmi 
Obsieh Waiss, the letter made the following points: 
 
--  Closing Mobil\'s existing terminal would pose grave 
operational problems for Mobil and have adverse consequences 
for Mobil\'s continued international presence in Djibouti; 
 
-- The 12-month notice to Mobil for implementation of 
relocation is very short given the consequences that could 
accrue to Mobil, in social and financial terms; 
 
-- As requested during the meeting Mobil\'s representative had 
with the Minister of Energy on May 16, Mobil asks to be 
provided all necessary information, including alternatives, 
in order that it be able to evaluate the operational, legal, 
social and financial implications of a possible closing and 
transfer of its activities; 
 
-- The Exxon-Mobil group questions the reasons which led the 
Government of Djibouti to take its decision and is standing 
by to know the methods the Government will use to ensure full 
compensation to Mobil for any consequences resulting from 
closure of its facility. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Your Competitor Is Not Your Friend 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Adam told Ambassador that Mobil\'s competitor Shell 
(UK) had agreed to make the same points in a similar letter 
to the Minister.  (Comment: Contrary to Adam\'s understanding, 
Ambassador has learned that Shell may actually be leaning 
toward moving to Doraleh.  End comment)   Total would not 
agree to send such a letter, according to Adam, and has 
decided that France\'s interests in Djibouti would not lead it 
to take a position that might provoke a showdown with the 
Government.  It would re-locate to Doraleh. Commander of 
French Forces in Djibouti, General Gerard Pons, confirmed 
this separately to Ambassador during her weekly meeting with 
Pons. 
 
5. (C) Ambassador queried Adam about the position Mobil has 
decided to take. She advised that by casting its letter in 
the terms that it had, Mobil may have backed itself into a 
corner and created an obstacle to its current and future 
business prospects in Djibouti.  In addition, Djibouti may 
decide not to compensate Mobil or might prolong the issue of 
compensation on technical or environmental grounds. Timing, 
on the other hand, would be of the essence to Mobil, given 
the obligations it would need to settle with its employees 
before completing the shutdown of its operations. 
 
6. (C) Adam replied that Mobil would pursue the case legally 
if Djibouti were not clear on compensation.  He said Mobil is 
adamant that it (a) will not repeat not invest in Doraleh 
because there is not a sufficient customer base to justify an 
investment; and (b) it will not repeat not join with its 
competitor ENOC in any investment scheme.  He said 86 percent 
of Mobil\'s business in Djibouti is geared to the Ethiopian 
market.  As Ethiopia recently requested \"buy-in\" into the new 
port at Doraleh (see Ref A), this market share would end. 
Ambassador cautioned that Ethiopia has not moved beyond the 
discussion stage of this request. 
 
----------------------- 
Not Getting the Support 
Required to Stay Alive 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) Adam also said ten percent of Mobil\'s business is from 
the Djiboutian government.  As the government is already 100 
million Djiboutian francs (USD 565,000) in arrears to Mobil, 
he had given an order to discontinue all oil supplies on 
credit to the Government effective from June 22nd until the 
arrears are paid. This, he claimed, would put Djibouti in a 
difficult situation in advance of June 27th national day 
celebrations here.  Adam said he expects Djibouti to pay the 
arrears soonest.  Adam continued that it does not help 
Mobil\'s position that \"90 percent\" of all business of the 
U.S. military based at Camp Lemonier, under administrative 
support of Brown and Root, is being given to France\'s Total. 
He said he did not trust Brown and Root\'s motives. (Comment: 
Ambassador has raised with responsible officials at the Camp, 
on two recent occasions, the issue of the Camp\'s purchase of 
fuel from Total vice Mobil, a U.S. company. On each occasion, 
the Camp said it had decided to vary its vendors \"for force 
protection reasons.\"  In addition, she was told that Total 
had made certain adjustments more favorable to Camp 
servicing.  End comment.) 
 
8. (C) Adam stated to Ambassador that if the U.S. military 
could use Mobil\'s office and warehouse facilities at the 
port, Mobil would be interested in selling.  This might 
obviate an eventual showdown with the Government of Djibouti. 
 Adam estimated the value of the site at between USD 10-15 
million dollars.  Ambassador said she could not answer the 
question of U.S. military interest in, or need for, the site 
but would be pleased to pass on his informal offer.  She also 
asked for a site plan and would take a fuller tour at an 
early date.  Adam said Mobil would want to begin negotiations 
with a buyer as soon as possible, which might also include a 
severance package for its 44 employees. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
9. (C) Comment:  Mobil\'s tank site at the port -- which it 
owns -- could be a potential gold mine.  Embassy has learned 
from another U.S. corporate source (strictly protect origin) 
that the Government of Djibouti is being advised of the huge 
potential value of the existing port site, in the heart of 
Djibouti City, for future development of a residential, 
commercial, or recreational complex.  If true, Mobil may find 
its request for \"compensation\" for its facilities swiftly 
honored by the Government. 
 
10. (C) Comment continued:  On sale of Mobil\'s existing 
facilities in anticipation of its departure, the informal 
offer to the U.S. military is an intriguing one.  We will 
pass this expression of interest on to NAVCENT. 
 
11. (C) As for Mobil\'s future here, this U.S. corporation 
appears to have decided that the existing, or potential 
investment climate in Djibouti would not support long-term 
feasible investment.  We are not sure this is a wise position 
to take at this time, given the new economic momentum in 
Djibouti.  Yet Djibouti lacks oil resources and could offer 
only services primarily as an oil products provider.  Mobil 
may have decided to cut its losses and invest in other 
potentially lucrative exploration markets coming on line 
elsewhere.  End comment.

SUBJECT: PROGRESS ON USAID-SPONSORED FEWSNET IN DJIBOUTI 
 
1. (U) Ambassador and USAID Director met June 10 with hosts 
of the USAID-sponsored Famine Early Warning System Network 
(FEWSNET) in Djibouti, at FEWSNET offices.  FEWSNET\'s goal is 
to strengthen the ability of Djibouti to manage the risk of 
food insecurity, through timely and analytical early warning 
and vulnerability information.  USAID has granted development 
contractor Chemonics USD 1 million to set up a FEWSNET office 
in Djibouti to monitor and predict food access for one year. 
The project was formally launched in March 2004. To date, 
FEWSNET has conducted two studies: an Urban Livelihood 
Baseline and a Rural Livelihood Baseline survey.  To 
undertake these studies, FEWSNET engaged experts worldwide. 
2. (U) Major findings of its Urban Livelihood Baseline Study 
indicate that: 
 
-- Most food purchased in Djibouti is not grown locally; 
-- Approximately 60 percent of the population in the poorer 
parts of the city of Djibouti live on less than USD 1 per day; 
-- The main source of income for the very poor and poor are 
casual labor, petty trade, and pensions; 
-- Besides food, water, kerosene and education are other 
significant expenditures for the populace. Doubling the price 
of kerosene will significantly reduce food purchasing power 
of the very poor by 10 percent; 
-- Most of the very poor that chew qat receive it as a gift; 
-- Households are vulnerable to increases in prices for 
imported food commodities, changes in government policy that 
affects salaries, pensions, and cost of non-food items and 
migration into the city.  Variations in the activity at the 
Port and the construction sector that affects casual labor 
also affect the poor households; 
-- Recent price increases are undermining urban food 
security, which is likely to result in a decline in food 
access for the very poor, and food intake of the very poor 
has probably been below minimum international standards since 
last February, 2004; 
-- In urban settings, most food is purchased and levels of 
income and patterns of expenditure are critical to food 
availability to all households. 
 
3. (U) FEWSNET holds that urban food security could be 
improved through reduced taxes for importing staple foods, 
monetization of food to stabilize market prices, extension of 
school feeding programs to poor urban neighborhoods and 
increase in government subsidies of the cost of education. In 
Djbouti, FEWSNET found that there are significant hidden 
costs associated with education.  Sending one child to middle 
school requires an expenditure of 10 percent of the income of 
the very poor and sending a child to secondary school is 
beyond the means of most very poor households. 
 
4. (U) Major findings of the Rural Baseline Study indicate 
that: 
 
-- People in the Central Pastoral Zone of Djibouti are most 
dependent on remittance income from the city of Djibouti; 
-- People in the Southeast Roadside Zone are dependent on the 
sale of milk, wood, fruits and vegetables to Djibouti city. 
 
5. (U) FEWSNET will monitor government policies, activities 
in the port and construction sectors, livestock and crop 
production, surrounding countries supplying Djibouti with 
produce and movements in the cost of the expenditure basket 
of different wealth groups in Djbouti in its effort to 
monitor and predict food access.  FEWSNET expects to 
disseminate accurate and timely early warning information, 
improve decision-making and response planning, strengthen 
country and regional networks and strengthen capacities 
through training.

DJIBOUTIAN DEVELOPMENT 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 731 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Marguerita D. Ragsdale. 
Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Ambassador and Pol/Econ met 22 June, with 
visiting Black & Veatch Corporation Director of International 
Consulting Engineering Services, Shahid Qadri, visiting Han 
Padron Associates Engineers Project Manager, Tony Bryan, and 
Director General of Djibouti International Airport, David 
Hawker, also an employee of Dubai Ports International, to 
discuss Black & Veatch\'s involvement in Djibouti.  Black & 
Veatch, provides engineering consulting services to port 
projects throughout the world.  It will focus on the water 
and electricity supply for Djibouti\'s new port facility at 
Doraleh.  The meeting covered prospects for success of the 
Doraleh project and its impact on different sectors of 
Djibouti\'s economy. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) Black & Veatch\'s (BV) mission for this trip to 
Djibouti is an initial survey of Djibouti\'s port facilities 
in preparation for the master plan for Dubai Ports 
International that BV is developing on the country\'s 
transportation sector, including its marine and air ports, in 
cooperation with Han Padron (HP), a New York based marine 
engineering company.  BV is also assessing Djibouti\'s 
infrastructure needs and available resources, as well as how 
BV might provide support.  Qadri agreed that most companies 
are not in the business of charity, but what they can do 
often enhances development goals and opens doors for other 
investment opportunities.  BV\'s role in HP\'s feasibility 
study is covering all bases relating to the Doraleh port, 
although its expertise and focus lies in water and 
electricity.  The main question BV will answer is whether 
these two utilities should be supplied from existing units or 
whether new units should be constructed. 
 
3. (C) HP representative, Tony Bryan, said he understood 
Electricite de Djibouti (EDD) is not planning to provide 
electrical power to the new Doraleh port.  In meetings with 
EDD, EDD indicated its hope that Doraleh would generate its 
own power.  EDD also said it would be receptive to a buy-back 
agreement should Doraleh choose to build a generator that 
could produce surplus energy.  The surplus energy generated 
would then be sold to EDD.  The comment was made that EDD 
projected a three percent growth rate for Djibouti, but had 
not yet created a plan to adapt production to the country\'s 
future population or economic growth requirements. 
 
4. (C) Qadri stated that BV\'s mission is not to invest, but 
to research the necessary information to enable investors to 
make the best decisions about putting their dollars to 
optimum use.  This information will be placed in the HP 
transportation sector/port master plan.  BV also hopes the 
master plan will identify commercial options for other 
companies.  BV and HP both commented that it was not 
necessary for the Port of Doraleh to pay the full cost of the 
investment needed to bring it to fruition.  Rather, it was 
preferable to offer up investment opportunities to work in 
cooperation with the Port of Doraleh.  Qadri commented that 
while investment potentials existed, the high cost of energy 
may be a deterrent. 
 
5. (C) Ambassador noted that the three resident oil companies 
- Mobil, Shell and Total - were being required by the 
government of Djibouti to move to Doraleh. (See Reftel) She 
queried the representatives on whether, in their opinion, the 
storage tank rental arrangement with Emirates National Oil 
Company (ENOC) envisioned in the move might result in lower 
fuel costs.  Bryan responded that the situation in Djibouti 
was akin to a can of worms and it might be better to start 
over with a new arrangement than try to untangle and sort out 
the current mess.  Hawker added that the head of ENOC had 
told him that he had been pressuring the head offices of all 
three companies to get in on the Doraleh project for the past 
three years, but all had declined.  Hawker said this may have 
been because the companies didn\'t think the project would 
succeed.  However, now that the project is well underway and 
going well, he continued, Shell Aviation has apparently 
shown interest in getting in on it.  Dubai Ports 
International (DPI), which manages the current port and 
airport, has announced that it will construct a new airport 
terminal to service Doraleh. 
 
6. (C) On whether the new port would succeed, attendees of 
the meeting seemed confident.  However, all agreed with 
Ambassador that regional conflict might be the potentially 
disrupting factor.  The question of how much it will improve 
the Djiboutian economic situation is still undetermined. 
Bryan commented that the current structure of employment in 
Djibouti was poor and that over-employment of people was 
endemic to the system.  He continued that the new port will 
create a higher level of employment, giving those already 
highly-skilled a greater choice.  This in turn would lead to 
the creation of lower level jobs.  However, Bryan said, for a 
real change in the high unemployment level in Djibouti, 
matters may worsen before getting better.  He said the 
Djiboutian economy will not pick up drastically until there 
is a period of vast unemployment, where the social welfare 
structure of the family can no longer provide for those 
unemployed.  Another key to improving the economic situation 
is the lowering of salaries and exchange rates, two 
recommendations also made by the IMF and World Bank. 
However, the comment was made that the Djiboutian government 
may not be concerned about improvement in these areas as long 
as donor money is coming in.  Qadri opined that the 
Government of Djibouti was now opting to try the 
economic/commercial development approach, which would 
eventually accomplish the same goals.

SUBJECT: THE NEW DJIBOUTI TELECOM 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed. 
For reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Djibouti Telecom announced the completion of 
its infrastructure extension on 21 June 2004.  The extension 
is part of the new look that foreign management is bringing 
to Djibouti Telecom over the course of its two-year 
transitional period before privatization.  This step is part 
of a system upgrade, which includes the eventual offering of 
DSL speed Internet and the use of fiber optics in the 
telephone switches.  The latest upgrade has increased the 
Internet capacity to 47 Mbps, which is eleven times the 
previous bandwidth and allows greater access to international 
sites.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) Djibouti Telecom (DT) has a brand new look.  Starting 
late May this year, enigmatic billboards started appearing 
around town telling of a new start for Djibouti Telecom to be 
revealed in June.  The mystery behind these billboards was 
revealed shortly after: a new look and logo for the company 
and its affiliate services for mobile phone and Internet. 
Pol/Econ and Econ assistant met with Djama Aouled Djama, 
Director of International and Legal Affairs to find out more 
about the \"new\" Djibouti Telecom.  The change in image is 
being accompanied by an increase in capacity for the Internet 
and an eventual move to fiberoptics for the main switching 
center.  This increase brings the Internet bandwidth 
available to Djibouti\'s users up to 47 Mbps from 4Mbps.  The 
end goal for DT is to provide DSL service to commercial and 
residential clients.  They hope to unveil this new service at 
the end of June, though realistically it can be expected 
sometime this fall.  DT will also soon begin installing fiber 
optics for use in the switching of telephone lines. 
 
3. (C) Privatization looks to be a long process for Djibouti 
Telecom.  According to a law passed in 1998, which sets forth 
key steps for privatization, the company will go through a 
two-year transition period followed by an open tender in 
order to decentralize shares.  DT\'s two-year transition 
period, which started November 2003, has brought in foreign 
management contracted for the specific task of reorganizing 
the company, improving the company\'s operations and restoring 
financial credibility.  The new management team brought in 
includes a French telecom specialist as the Director General 
and a Tunisian specialist as the Director of Finance.  Djama 
commented that while the new team is certainly changing 
things, the changes are not in the right areas.  The team has 
been spending large sums to overhaul the look of DT, purchase 
cars and equipment, and improve the superficial face of DT. 
Djama noted that the new management has not made a move to 
focus changes on the efficiency and training of staff, both 
current and potential.  The current make-up of Djibouti\'s 
workforce has few trained technicians in telecom specialties, 
necessitating the contracting of more expensive foreign 
workers. 
 
4. (C) After the transitional period, an open tender will 
sell the bulk of the company\'s shares creating a Strategic 
Equity Partnership between the Government of Djibouti (GODJ) 
and the purchasing company.  The goal for the GODJ is selling 
49 percent of shares to private investment, though Djama 
commented realistically the government does not want to sell 
more than 30 percent.  He said he was doubtful about the 
success of the 1998 privatization law\'s implementation, 
citing the lack of interest so far and the fact that there 
are more problems to fix in Djibouti before it can attract 
the kind of company needed to successfully privatize the 
telecom sector.  Djama said most often the reasons government 
utilities are privatized are fiscal constraints, industry 
liberalization, improving quality of services, reducing 
costs, and complete overhaul of a sector of industry.  For 
Djibouti, the motivation appears to be a little of each as 
the government strives to update its industries to modern 
technology.  Djama said he believed that the privatization 
would succeed, it would just take much more time than 
planned. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: Post feels the privatization of the telecom 
industry in Djibouti will take time, but will eventually 
succeed.  Outside influences, especially foreign investment 
and the GODJ desire to connect to the transoceanic cable 
SEA-ME-WE4, will have positive effects on the reorganization 
and recreation of the telecom industry in Djibouti.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Ambassador hand-carried June 30 to Mohamed Ali Hassan, 
Director of Bilateral Relations at Djibouti\'s Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, an English version and a French translation 
of the diplomatic note provided paragraph 3 of reftel.  The 
Bilateral Relations Director acknowledged receipt of these 
documents by stamping and dating Ambassador\'s copies, at her 
request, for the Embassy\'s records. 
 
2. (C) Hassan asked for clarification of the language in the 
diplomatic note which specified that \"this new agreement 
would supersede several agreements currently in force between 
our two governments, which are related to the 2002 Access 
Agreement, concerning access to and use of the aforementioned 
properties, facilities, and infrastructure.\"  Ambassador 
responded that it would be the preference of the United 
States to unite existing accords with the Government of 
Djibouti, relating to the 2002 Access Agreement, under a 
single umbrella agreement.  She also reminded Hassan that the 
note is simply an announcement, as required to be met by June 
30 under the U.S.-Djibouti Access Agreement of 2002, of U.S. 
intent to renew for a longer stay and is not a delineation of 
access terms. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador also told Hassan that the U.S. would be 
represented in negotiations by Deputy Secretary of Defense 
Theresa Whelan, along with a negotiating team. The U.S. 
requests a list of Djibouti\'s negotiators as well as its 
preference for venue of talks.  She said the U.S. is willing 
to come to Djibouti, if Djibouti prefers.  Hassan responded 
that it was not yet clear who would take part on the 
Djiboutian side. He added his belief that Djibouti would 
probably prefer Washington as a venue for talks.  To Hassan\'s 
inquiry concerning when the U.S. required this information, 
Ambassador responded that it was needed as soon as possible. 
Hassan said he would try to get this information, but it was 
unlikely he would have it until after President Guelleh 
returns July 8 from the African Union conference in Addis 
Ababa. 
 
4. (C) According to Hassan, the Djiboutian side would require 
a draft of proposed terms of an access agreement in advance 
of the start of negotiations.  \"A list of what you want as 
compared to what you have now will allow us to conduct 
preliminary discussions in Djibouti with various elements,\" 
he explained.  He added that \"it is about knowing the impact 
of decisions we take, not just signing a document.\" 
Ambassador said she would pass this information to 
Washington, and would have a reply for him shortly.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI MAPS OUT EDUCATION REFORM 
 
 
1. (U) Djibouti\'s Minister of Education, Abdi Ibrahim Absieh, 
and Minister of Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Mahmoud Ali Youssef, recently assembled donor 
country representatives in Djibouti, as well as concerned UN 
offices, to outline Djibouti\'s education policy and steps 
toward education reform.  Both Ministers stated that human 
resources development through education and training is the 
primary strategic path towards reducing the country\'s 
poverty. 
 
2. (U) Absieh told the donors and representatives that thanks 
to his Ministry\'s efforts and the support of technical and 
financial partners, Djibouti had managed to improve access to 
primary education by increasing the number of classrooms from 
570 in 2000 to 748 in 2003.  In addition, the numbers of 
primary school teachers increased sufficiently to meet the 
demands posed by an increase in the number of students.  The 
average rate of primary education schooling, he said, went 
from 39 percent to 52 percent during the same period.  In 
addition, students and teachers in basic education increased 
respectively by 25 percent and 12 percent during this period. 
 Since the creation in Djibouti in 2000 of POLE University, 
the numbers of students in higher education increased due to 
an increase in the number of graduates from secondary 
schools.  He said POLE had made advances in improving 
education quality, program review, scheduling and teaching 
through a competency-based approach.  On a general level, 
regularization of teachers\' salaries had improved the level 
of motivation of teachers and contributed to a reduction in 
absenteeism. 
 
3. (U)  Absieh spoke about the institutional capacities of 
his Ministry to manage education reform. He said these 
capacities had been reinforced with the creation of a new 
organizational chart that is much more functional and the 
donation of a new building to the Ministry where all 
administration and teaching services are now based.  In 
addition, Education\'s share of the nation\'s budget has been 
in continuous growth for the past four years. 
 
4. (U) Absieh outlined the following objectives Djibouti\'s 
education sector hoped to achieve as a result of reform: 
 
-- work on improving girls\' education and education of 
children from underprivileged backgrounds and reducing the 
dropout rate; 
- 
-- set up a public pre-school which can be used as an example 
for development of private pre-schools; 
- 
-- increase available classrooms to help meet universal 
primary schooling of children from six to sixteen years; 
- 
--finalize reform of technical and vocational education by 
establishing Learning Centers in professional fields 
compatible with each region\'s economy; 
- 
--encourage private initiative in private education by 
adopting new legislation on modalities of creating and 
operating private schools; 
- 
-- provide student access to all textbooks and teachers\' 
guides compatible with new instructional approaches at all 
levels in basic education; 
- 
--consolidate program assessment and learning capacities of 
the Center for Research, Information and Production of 
National Education (CRIPEN) and accelerate introduction of 
radio, TV and new information and telecommunications 
technologies in teaching techniques. 
 
5. (U) Absieh added that to be able to run an education 
system that has drastically changed, new and modern 
management tools and training sessions are needed to improve 
organizational and planning capacities at all levels of 
administration.  He said decentralized structures will be 
created and careful study will be given to equipment and 
infrastructure.  Moreover, local communities and 
student-parent associations will be encouraged to participate 
in the management and maintenance of schools.  In non-formal 
education, public partners as well as NGOs will be involved 
in the development of a strategy for adult literacy programs. 
 
6. (U) The World Bank\'s representative, Ousmane Diagane, 
commended the Minister of Education for the efforts his 
department was making and encouraged similar meetings with 
donor partners on a regular basis.  He said such a meeting 
will enable donors to exchange information and coordinate 
their actions to support millennium challenge objectives, 
especially to achieve gender parity in education.  He also 
praised the quality of education in Djibouti, especially the 
availability of textbooks that is bringing the ratio from one 
textbook per four students down to a ratio of one textbook 
for each student.  However, he underlined that the number of 
school children should be increased and the recruitment of 
women in the teaching profession should be encouraged in 
order to further promote girls\' education.  He reminded the 
donor community of its commitment in Dakar to provide 
resources to each country at a level that will demonstrate a 
political will to extend education to all.  He said the World 
Bank has initiated a loan program to implement rapidly the 
\"Education for All\" program for countries with limited 
financial resources. 
 
7. (U) Based on a proposal put forward by France\'s 
Development Director, France was unanimously chosen as 
coordinator of the donor community in the field of education 
in Djibouti.  Its role will consist of coordinating the 
intervention of financial and technical partners and 
disseminating information as well as facilitating accelerated 
implementation of the \"Education for All\" program. 
 
8. (U) Comment: Through a grant of USD 12 million, USAID is 
assisting the Ministry of Education to implement the 
education reform program throughout the nation.  USAID 
support to Djibouti\'s basic education program (Grades 1-12) 
has four major elements:  increased access to basic education 
through school construction and rehabilitation; improved 
quality of teaching and learning; increased opportunities for 
girls\' education; and promotion of strategies and training to 
provide sustainable employment to school graduates, 
particularly girls.  Strategies to achieve these objectives 
rely on the provision of new information and communication 
technology services as well as traditional means to improve 
education, using both formal and non-formal education 
approaches to reach out to diverse and needy groups. 
 
9. (U) Other donors supporting education reform include 
France, which provides teachers for secondary schools, Saudi 
Arabia, which supports Koranic schools in an amount 
approaching USD 10 million, the World Bank, which is 
providing USD 10 million in soft loans for reform (new school 
construction) and the African Development Fund, which is 
engaged in school rehabilitation. End comment.

FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (U) Action requested paragraph 4. 
 
2. (C) Chief of National Security, Hassan Said Khaireh, has 
requested of the Ambassador, in a letter dated June 21, 2004, 
two mobile scanners and ten portable metal detectors \"to 
enable immigration and border police to control baggage 
arriving at the international airport of Djibouti.\"  Khaireh 
stated that the request was being made in the context of the 
struggle against international terrorism and the U.S. \"Safe 
Skies\" program. 
 
3. (C) Although the host nation has requested these items in 
an effort to strengthen security measures at its airport, 
Post believes the host nation lacks sufficient technical 
knowledge to use and properly deploy the equipment requested. 
 The host nation has stated to RSO its great concern about 
the lack of security aboard air carriers flying out of 
Somalia and into Djibouti.  The host nation considers it 
highly plausible that an individual could carry weapons or 
explosives aboard a flight originating in Somalia and 
subsequently bring these items into Djibouti.  Since the host 
nation cannot affect appropriate security measures in Somalia 
and the airlines lack resources to take on extensive security 
measures to mitigate this threat, it is prudent of Djibouti 
to seek other solutions.  Unfortunately, the type of baggage 
screening equipment it has requested does not appear to suit 
its needs.  Specifically, the type of portable x-ray scanners 
the host nation has requested cannot properly screen baggage 
on a continual basis because of their small size. 
 
4. (C)   Action requested:  Post believes that the host 
nation would be better off utilizing a belt-fed baggage 
scanner that can be installed permanently.  Should the 
Department approve this request, consultations should be 
conducted with the Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) to determine the proper equipment to deploy that can be 
easily operated and maintained in this environment. 
Instructors Lou Armour and Tracy Fields from the TSA 
conducted an airport security management course in Djibouti 
in December of 2002 and can provide a clear assessment of the 
requirements.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI CELEBRATES 27 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Djibouti marked the 27th anniversary of its 
independence from France, Sunday, June 27, 2004 with 
Government hosted celebrations including a military parade 
and a reception at the Presidential Palace.  Ambassador with 
USLO attended the early morning parade, and was accompanied 
by USLO, Pol/Econ, PAO and USAID at the presidential 
reception. There, in the presence of his cabinet, parliament 
members, the former President of Djibouti, village elders and 
a host of other Djiboutian citizens and invited guests, 
President Ismael Omar Guelleh addressed the population in two 
speeches: one in French and one in Somali.  In his remarks in 
French, he spoke about measuring progress, the necessity of 
building a democratic state, his own progress as President, 
ties with the larger world, and the problems of Iraq, the 
Palestinians, Somalia and Sudan in the Near East and Horn of 
Africa region.   Guelleh\'s speech in Somali was impromptu and 
was not published in the newspapers or copied to the 
diplomatic community.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) President Ismael Omar Guelleh\'s speech in French to 
the people of Djibouti began by underlining the importance of 
progress taking time, saying \"the progress of nations is not 
measured by a combination of ephemeral events, but by 
successive historic steps taken by each generation to leave 
the next with the best of its own.\"  Guelleh continued that 
in celebrating the day of independence, \"it reminds us to ask 
ourselves if each one of us has done all that can be done for 
succeeding generations.\" Guelleh transitioned into the topic 
of presidential elections by speaking of next year\'s 
celebration being led by \"the leaders chosen by the 
Djiboutian people in the next presidential election.\" 
 
3. (U) Guelleh commented that whoever is elected will be 
expected to build an efficient democratic state which stands 
against all forms of discrimination, continue to build a 
liberal economy to generate wealth and employment, construct 
a society of solidarity and favor a cultural renaissance in 
line with the times, respectful of the Djiboutian identity. 
 
4. (U) Guelleh was confident in assessing his performance of 
the objectives he initiated, saying \"I believe that we have 
reached the objectives that constitute a reinvention of a 
modern and modest nation, conscious not to just take the 
missions that it is able to accomplish, but determined to 
assume full responsibility, with forward thinking and the 
capacity of innovation.\"  Guelleh continued that \"the best 
sign of our commitment to independence and the most solid 
gauge of its longevity resides in the concretisation of our 
firm will to render justice to the women of Djibouti.\" 
Guelleh also highlighted his administration\'s creation of a 
Family Code of Law, which using a combination of French civil 
code and Sharia law, and replaces the use of Sharia law in 
family matters. 
 
5. (U) Guelleh\'s speech also addressed the widening of 
Djibouti\'s diplomatic circles and friendships around the 
globe.  Guelleh commented that the decision by COMESA to hold 
the next summit in Djibouti is a \"mark of confidence in the 
manner of Djiboutian diplomacy over the past 27 years 
striving to make an efficient instrument of service to our 
economic ambition and to present the international scene with 
a confirmation of our will to work towards peace and harmony 
throughout, for African and Arab-Islamic unity.\" 
 
6. (U) Speaking on the current round of Somali peace talks in 
Nairobi, Guelleh said that after two years of negotiation, 
its final phase \"fulfills the hopes that we have, in the 
course of this summer by the grace of God, for the creation 
of republican institutions under the sovereign will of the 
Somali people.\"  Guelleh then called for international 
support of the next Somali government saying, \"no structure 
of a State can be viable if the international community does 
not cement its support by furnishing and accompanying the 
institution of the next Somali government, with the human, 
material and financial means necessary to accomplish its 
mission.\" 
 
7. (U) Guelleh added, however, that \"by contrast, the 
Republic of Djibouti will never accept the destructive policy 
aimed at failure, which guides Mister Sharon in leading the 
Palestinian conflict.  He has anchored himself into a 
unilateral vision, excluding completely the Palestinian 
people with the firm will to install an Israeli country in 
the Palestinian territory.\"  He continued \"Mister Sharon 
demonstrates once again his will to simply deny the existence 
of the Palestinian people.  We remain convinced that, with 
this arrangement, there cannot be peace in the framework 
negotiated for the existence of two nations within viable 
territories.\" 
 
8. (U) Guelleh closed his speech by applauding the signing of 
the Sudan peace accords, congratulating the United Nations 
for their efforts to \"help the Iraqi people in their pursuit 
of peace and security,\"  He stated: \"We remain convinced that 
the process of returning the leadership of their own destiny 
to the hands of the Iraqi people by way of a provisional 
council constitutes the wisest road for the return of peace 
and security to the hearts and spirits of our Iraqi brethren, 
and we will continue to support all engagements carried out 
to safeguard the unity, the sovereignty of the Iraqi people 
and the integrity of Iraq.\" 
 
9. (U) Broad press coverage in \"La Nation\" newspaper was 
given to President Bush\'s message of congratulations on the 
occasion of Djibouti\'s national day.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (S) During the July 6 meeting of the U.S.-Djibouti 
Military Coordinating Committee, Abdurahman Boreh, Special 
Economic Advisor to President Ismail Omar Guelleh, told USLO 
Chief that the Government of Djibouti would like to construct 
a new international airport. He said an American consulting 
firm was already under contract to do a preliminary study and 
to produce a master plan. This future airport, he continued, 
would benefit U.S. military forces.  Essentially, the new 
airport would allow Djibouti to turn over its current 
international airport exclusively for military use. 
American, French, and Djiboutian military personnel would 
have complete control of the premises to enforce security and 
develop a runway that could meet all the services\' needs. 
When USLO Chief pressed on financing possibilities for a new 
international airport, Boreh admitted that financing was 
currently lacking. However, he offered the view that Shaykh 
Mohamed (bin Rashid?) of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, 
owner of Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC) and Dubai Ports 
International (DPI), would finance a new passenger terminal 
if the Government of Djibouti could finance the new airport\'s 
runways, ramps and control tower. 
 
2. (S) Intriguingly, Boreh stated that he hoped this time the 
U.S. military would \"plan ahead\" and \"think seriously\" about 
the opportunity that was before it, instead of making the 
same mistake that was made in 2002 when U.S. forces were 
offered Camp Lemonier, and all the land east to the sea, and 
turned it down.  USLO explained to Boreh that no element of 
the Department of Defense could pay for or assist in the 
development of a civilian airport.  Boreh smiled and said he 
was sure that some arrangement could be made during the 
upcoming negotiations for Camp Lemonier. 
 
3. (S) By decree of President Guelleh, the U.S.-Djibouti 
military coordinating committee was established in October, 
2003 to coordinate and facilitate U.S. military assistance to 
Djibouti.  The committee consists of, besides Boreh, Major 
Patrick Anderson, Embassy Djibouti\'s USLO Chief, Mohamed Ali 
Hassan, Director of Bilateral Relations in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Lt.Col. Abdurahman Dembil, Presidential 
Defense Advisor, and Col. Osman Soubagleh, Director of 
International Relations, Djiboutian Army Headquarters.  The 
committee meets weekly to discuss the status of security 
assistance programs and military issues in general.  During 
the July 6 meeting, all members of the committee expressed 
the desire that a new access agreement between Djibouti and 
the United States for use of Camp Lemonier be comprehensive 
and cover all future U.S. requirements for security, 
logistical support and training. 
 
4. (S) In other business at the July 6 meeting, Boreh sought 
USLO Chief\'s assistance in determining if the U.S. Navy had 
any concerns, or any additional requirements, following the 
June 30 tour by Captain Kurt Kunkel, N-4 of the Fifth Fleet, 
of the Port of Doraleh\'s construction site.  During Capt. 
Kunkel\'s visit to the port, the length of the berth became a 
topic of discussion.  The current Doraleh port project design 
calls for a berth of 210 meters with dolphin anchor points 
extending to 324 meters.  Boreh asked USLO Chief if these 
dimensions would be sufficient to meet anticipated use of the 
berth by the U.S. Navy.  (Note:  Ambassador had requested the 
visit of a NAVCENT representative to Djibouti to tour the 
Doraleh site after she learned from Exxon-Mobil Corporation 
that the U.S. Navy had contracted, under DESC auspices, to 
lease four container storage tanks from ENOC for future fuel 
storage at Doraleh.  End Note). 
 
5. (S) Comment:  Boreh\'s statement that Djibouti planned to 
build a new airport confirmed an earlier discussion 
Ambassador had with the Doraleh port site manager, K.K. Menon 
(strictly protect) on June 30.  The informal \"proposal\" that 
the existing airport could be turned over for combined 
military use, if a new airport is built, was conveyed to USLO 
only days after post delivered its diplomatic note to 
Djibouti\'s Foreign Ministry informing the Government of the 
U.S.\'s desire to re-negotiate agreements related to Camp 
Lemonier.  Post believes that the Government of Djibouti may 
see base negotiations as a vehicle to help finance a new 
international airport in Djibouti. It will likely argue that, 
while costly, a new airport would be in the best short and 
long-term interests of the U.S. End comment.

2. (C) Ambassador asked for a copy of the court brief, which 
Adam provided on July 10.  The brief, through La SCP Boivin 
et Associes (Attorneys-at-Law), based in Paris, and Alain 
Martinet, a local lawyer in Djibouti, presents as facts, per 
Embassy\'s informal translation, inter alia: 
 
-- that Mobil has operated in Djibouti since the 1970s; 
-- that Mobil is sole owner of the site of land on which its 
activities are taking place; 
-- that Mobil has made substantial improvements to the site 
over the years and that the site has the capacity to store 
around 90,957 cubic meters of hydrocarbons; 
-- that Mobil is a substantial employer in Djibouti-- with 43 
contract employees for an indeterminate duration and with an 
additional 39 temporary employees; 
-- that information concerning the new Port of Doraleh 
remains fragmentary, indeed incomplete, and does not allow 
Mobil to envisage what would be its place in the new 
infrastructure; 
-- that the excavation work for the new port only began in 
the month of June 2003, and this infrastructure could not 
possibly be operational, at best, until the end of 2005; 
-- and that Mobil had not received from the Djiboutian 
authorities any official information concerning the 
cancellation of petroleum activities on the site of the 
current and how the required transfer to Doraleh would take 
place. 
- 
In its court brief, Mobil also alleges that the decision of 
the Minister of Equipment and Transport, as enunciated in the 
May 10 letter, is illegal, in that the decision is: 
 
--tainted by defect of knowledge and is taken in ignorance of 
the general principle of respect for rights of the defense to 
present its observations; and 
--is not in conformity with the Constitution of Djibouti, is 
lacking in legal basis, does not support justifications of 
general interests, and leads to disproportionate and 
discriminatory consequences. 
 
3. (C) In her meeting with Mobil representatives, Ambassador 
reiterated her preference that Mobil not quit its operations 
in Djibouti, if at all possible.  She said it was important 
to have a major American company doing business in Djibouti 
and continuing its positive impact on the Djiboutian economy. 
 DiTullio said he believed the Government of Djibouti had not 
thought seriously about the loss of revenues and jobs that 
would follow a Mobil departure.  Adam pressed the point that 
it was not possible to complete the port of Doraleh in the 
time frame envisioned by the Government and that he had so 
informed the Government.  Ambassador cautioned that this 
might be a less effective position to take with a very 
sensitive Djiboutian government. She said, indeed, Emirates 
National Oil Company (ENOC)-- the project manager-- is moving 
toward 24-hour shifts to ensure completion of the Doraleh 
project AHEAD of schedule. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador also expressed to Mobil her willingness to 
approach President Guelleh directly on Mobil\'s behalf, if it 
is Mobil\'s corporate preference to fight to retain its 
operations at the existing port.  She said she believed Total 
would certainly press to do so, if it has not already done 
so, but was unsure about Shell. Indeed, Ambassador added, 
Total will likely present an argument that the Government of 
Djibouti needs a back-up terminal to Doraleh and that Total\'s 
facilities at the existing port might fill that need, 
especially if Shell and Mobil have already folded.  DiTullio 
thanked Ambassador for her willingness to support Mobil\'s 
presence here at the highest levels of the Djiboutian 
government and said he would let the Ambassador know as to 
the route corporate headquarters in Fairfax ultimately wished 
to take on this matter. 
 
5. (C) During the meeting, Adam repeated the offer that Mobil 
made earlier to the U.S. military to purchase its Djibouti 
site, should Mobil ultimately be obliged to vacate.  The site 
consists primarily of storage tanks, offices and warehouses. 
(see reftel A)  Ambassador said she understood that the U.S. 
military did not see an interest or need in purchasing the 
Mobil site.  Adam said Mobil would accept a leasing 
arrangement, if the U.S. military preferred. Ambassador 
suggested that it might be better for Exxon-Mobil\'s Fairfax 
headquarters to put forward such a plan formally to the U.S. 
Department of Defense, rather than broach it regionally or 
locally. 
 
6. (C) Adam also reiterated his long-standing complaint that 
Camp Lemonier has not used Mobil\'s services in its petroleum 
purchases in Djibouti. Ambassador encouraged, and DiTullio 
supported vigorously, that Adam set up direct contact with 
CJTF-HOA Commander  General Helland at Camp Lemonier on this 
issue.  DiTullio concurred, and stated that personal 
relations are very important. He added that it is also 
important to let the Camp know the aspects of Mobil\'s 
services that make it the superior vendor in Djibouti. Adam 
has since taken steps to follow up and Ambassador also raised 
this with General Helland during her weekly meeting with him 
on 7/12. 
 
7. (C) Comment: Mobil\'s court action may be primarily a 
tactical step to protect its considerable financial 
interests, more than focused on immediate remedies.  It is 
clear, however, that Mobil would prefer -- if business volume 
warranted -- to retain its operations at the existing port. 
If it cannot, it has also made clear that it is prepared to 
leave -- with full compensation for its losses expected of 
the Government of Djibouti. Mobil insists that the current 
Djiboutian economic environment cannot sustain the viability 
of four oil companies.  Ambassador has encouraged Mobil to 
think long-term, rather than short-term, and to consider 
future commercial possibilities if Doraleh turns out to be 
the economic powerhouse the Government of Djibouti expects. 
In addition, she has advised Mobil that it is a far greater 
challenge for a company to re-enter a market, and regain 
goodwill,  once it has vacated it. End comment.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
1. (C)  In separate meetings with Saleban Omar Oudine, 
Minister of Commerce and Industry, and Ismail Hussein Tani, 
President Guelleh\'s Cabinet Director, Ambassador discussed 
the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and 
Djibouti\'s expectations as new vice-chair of the organization 
and as host of the 2005 COMESA conference (at which time 
Djibouti becomes chair).  Both officials had accompanied 
President Guelleh to the May 31-June 8 COMESA conference in 
Kampala. 
 
2. (C) For Oudine, the year 2005 and Djibouti\'s forthcoming 
chairmanship is important because they open new economic 
opportunities for Djibouti.  The year 2005 coincides with the 
launch and inauguration of the country\'s new port at Doraleh, 
currently under construction.  Djibouti would use the annual 
conference, he said, as a platform from which to present the 
port to all COMESA participant countries and to encourage its 
use by land-locked countries such as Uganda, Malawi and 
Rwanda. Uganda, for example, might profit from Djibouti\'s 
services, since 20 percent of its imports and exports are 
currently stolen annually at the port facility it uses in 
Kenya.  Flights could shuttle cargo directly between Djibouti 
and Kampala, the Minister added. Rwanda might also benefit 
economically, Oudine said.  He noted that while Rwanda had 
been deeply interested in the presidency of COMESA for 2005, 
Djibouti had done some backroom politicking to persuade 
Rwanda to look instead toward 2006 as the year to seek the 
presidency. Djibouti needed the year 2005 to boost its 
economic hopes for Doraleh, the Minister said. 
 
3. (C) Oudine and Tani told Ambassador that unlike most 
COMESA countries, Djibouti has no resources to sell and can 
only look toward services as the best source for income 
generation. Besides encouraging transshipment of goods, it 
could take advantage of COMESA by encouraging the 
establishment of small industries that would operate with raw 
materials from COMESA countries.  According to Tani, the 
Government of Djibouti intends to promote its liberal 
economic regime, and the port of Doraleh, to convince COMESA 
countries that Djibouti is a natural and logical gateway to 
their markets.  They will be advised that purchasing goods 
through Djibouti rather than through Dubai will save both 
time and money. 
 
4. (C) Oudine remarked that at the last COMESA conference, 
customs uniformity was a key issue.  He said Djibouti sees 
advantages in uniformity and it and other members hope 
uniformity can be reached by December 2004.  However, most 
countries opted for a delay because studies on the impact of 
this new system were not yet complete. It was believed that 
customs uniformity would be advantageous for a country like 
Kenya but would be very difficult to implement in countries 
such as Somalia and Sudan. If uniformity, Oudine said, 
disadvantages a country in terms of revenue generated, 
perhaps the U.S. Agency for International Development might 
make funds available to compensate those countries for 
revenues lost.  Besides economic integration, Tani remarked 
to Ambassador that Djibouti and other COMESA members are 
determined to have COMESA play an important role in other 
areas such as conflict resolution and political stability, 
for the long-term benefit of member states. 
 
5. (C) Oudine and Tani admitted that hosting the COMESA 
conference\'s eighteen member states in 2005 will be a huge 
logistical challenge for Djibouti.  A special committee is 
being created now to handle preparations for next year\'s 
conference.  The Government of Djibouti is exploring ideas 
for housing guests, especially heads of state.  It hopes that 
some of the villas included in the new Haramous housing 
development project, led by the Saudi investment company Maya 
Trading, will be ready by then.  (Note:  Embassy understands 
from Maya Trading that houses envisioned for the Haramous 
project are intended to be sold to private individual 
investors.  End note)  Also, some of the local hotels, Tani 
said, are expected to dedicate rooms for COMESA to use in 
order to boost hotel capacity.  Dubai Ports International is 
also planning to build a hotel by reclaiming the sea near the 
Palais du Peuple opposite the port. Yet Tani does not expect 
the hotel to be completed by 2005.  Finding a conference room 
that is large enough should not be a problem, Oudine said, 
but other costs in producing such a conference will be 
involved so the Government of Djibouti will officially 
request assistance from the U.S. and international 
organizations in the lead-up to the conference. Ambassador 
responded that such requests would need to be clearly 
outlined and made with sufficient lead time. 
 
6. (C) Tani broached the idea that Djibouti may, repeat may, 
press to postpone the COMESA conference until November, 2005 
instead of June, 2005, but not for logistical reasons. 
Djibouti\'s presidential elections scheduled for 2005, the hot 
summer period from June through September, and Ramadan\'s 
occurrence in October may mandate a later time frame. He 
emphasized that no formal request for change of timing had 
yet been put forward. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  Upon his return from the Kampala summit, 
President Guelleh stated publicly that the choice of Djibouti 
as vice-chair and host for the 2005 COMESA summit is an 
\"international affirmation of Djibouti, which does not cease 
to play a more and more supreme role in international 
affairs.\"  That said, it is clear that Djibouti also sees its 
newly-claimed affirmation as a tremendous economic 
opportunity, of which it hastens to take advantage.  If 2005 
is to be Djibouti\'s \"economic year,\" COMESA is as good a 
platform as any for this ambitious and optimistic country to 
push the envelope just a bit more.  End comment.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) During Ambassador\'s call on Ismail Hussein Tani, 
President Guelleh\'s Cabinet Director, to discuss the Common 
Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) (see septel), 
Tani -- who describes his job as \"translating and explaining 
the agenda and vision of President Guelleh to Djiboutians\" -- 
commented on the huge Doraleh port project that is generating 
much debate in Djibouti.  The Government\'s critics call the 
project an example of Djibouti\'s subjugation to \"Dubai, 
Incorporated.\" 
 
2. (C) Tani preferred to describe Djibouti\'s Doraleh port 
project as a \"partnership\" between Dubai and Djibouti.  \"It 
is a win-win situation which we welcome because the 
relationship will boost Djibouti\'s economy,\" he told 
Ambassador.  It should be clear, though, he added, that the 
Doraleh port project belongs to Djibouti.  Emirates National 
Oil Company (ENOC) simply \"owns\" (his term) the oil terminal. 
 Dubai Ports International (DPI), (an ENOC affiliate) which 
manages the airport and existing seaport in Djibouti, has 
been authorized to manage Doraleh\'s construction and to 
search for sources of financing, Tani continued.  The 
authority of the Government of Djibouti, he remarked, is 
represented by Abdurahman Boreh (a prominent Djiboutian 
businessman and Doraleh port investor), and is very trusted 
by the Government.  Asked about Boreh\'s share in the project, 
Tani responded \"of course, Boreh has his personal interest in 
the port and owns some shares.\"  Yet our biggest partner for 
use of Doraleh, he told Ambassador, will be Ethiopia.  He 
clarified that Ethiopia will not be given any decision-making 
authority over the port because the port is intended to 
benefit \"all interested parties\" and not solely Ethiopia. 
 
3. (C) Tani stated that the Government of Djibouti is 
grateful for the U.S. Navy\'s (NAVCENT\'s) contract (via DESC) 
for four fuel storage tanks at Doraleh \"because the contract 
promotes the good reputation and viability of Doraleh port.\"

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Ambassador delivered reftel demarche 7/15 to Minister 
of Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mahmoud 
Ali Youssef.  She went over the points provided in reftel, 
tracking them by line item, while Youssef listened and took 
notes.  At the end of her presentation, the Ambassador said 
she would also provide a non-paper for the Government of 
Djibouti\'s use with its United Nations representative as we 
expected the vote on the proposed resolution to take place as 
early as the following day, 7/16. 
 
2. (C) Youssef then asked Ambassador what was her personal 
view, \"as a human being,\" of the wall that Israel is 
constructing. Ambassador responded that she preferred to view 
the issue of Israel\'s security wall in terms of the parties 
most affected by it and in terms of the response the United 
States has already made to it. For Israel, she said, it is 
its view that the wall offers the best protection for its 
citizenry from the probability of suicide bombers.  Since the 
wall\'s construction began, the number of incidences of 
suicide bombings has decreased.  Constructing the wall to 
prevent such attacks is a judgment that Israel has made, 
based on its perceived needs.  The Palestinians, she 
continued, view it as disproportionately burdensome on them 
on humanitarian grounds and as a \"land grab\" by Israel of 
occupied territory.  Some Palestinians take the position that 
if the wall should be created at all, it should be created on 
land that is Israel proper, and not part of the West Bank. 
From the U.S. perspective, the Ambassador continued, there 
are continuing concerns about the route the wall is taking, 
and we have made known those concerns to Israel. 
 
3. (C) Youssef responded that he wanted to speak very frankly 
about this issue.  He recalled a statement attributed to 
Benazir Bhutto, former President of Pakistan, on the practice 
of the veiling of women.  \"The only veil that truly exists,\" 
Youssef quoted Bhutto, \"is the one that is in the eyes of 
individuals.\"  Applying this to the conflict between Israelis 
and Palestinians, he said he is convinced that there is a 
mindset in that region now that is becoming very closed -- 
both on the part of Israelis and Palestinians. He fears that 
mindset more than anything else because it could mean the 
eventual impossibility of future dialogue.  He said he was 
convinced that Israel could build another wall if it wished, 
and perhaps five more, but it will never achieve security for 
itself in the process.  The only way that Israel can have 
security, he stated, is to have a dialogue, not build walls. 
To continue to blame the lack of dialogue on the Palestinians 
is not accurate. 
 
4. (C) Youssef continued that the United States has to take 
the lead role in making this dialogue happen.  To constantly 
endorse the actions of Israel, regardless of the nature of 
the action, and whether that position is right or wrong, is 
not helpful to this process.  The U.S., he went on to say, 
has put forward a very interesting proposal called the Middle 
East Partnership Initiative, which raises some very 
interesting possibilities for our region. Yet it will be 
impossible for the U.S. to move forward on that issue until 
the problem between Palestinians and Israelis is resolved. 
Moreover, constantly taking positions that are clearly 
one-sided and imbalanced with respect to Israel, he 
continued, undermines U.S. moderate partners such as Egypt 
and Jordan.  Youssef said he failed to see, \"as a human 
being,\" the sense sometimes in the positions the U.S. 
government is taking. 
 
5. (C) Youssef also said that it does not matter in the end 
whether Djibouti votes for the resolution calling for General 
Assembly endorsement of the International Court of Justice 
advisory opinion or abstains.  This resolution will be voted 
in the affirmative by the vast majority of U.N. members. 
This will leave, he said, the U.S. in the position of having 
to veto, which will ultimately be unhelpful for the U.S. and 
the eventual resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli problem. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  Djibouti has avoided taking public stances 
in its mainstream news media on the Palestinian-Israeli 
issue. However, sympathy for the Palestinian plight is 
revealed in official remarks, most recently in President 
Guelleh\'s speech on June 27 commemorating Djibouti\'s National 
Day.  In that message, Guelleh said \"Djibouti will never 
accept the destructive policy aimed at failure, which guides 
Mister Sharon in leading the Palestinian conflict.  He has 
anchored himself into a unilateral vision, excluding 
completely the Palestinian people, with his firm will to 
install an Israeli state within Palestinian territory.\" 
 
7. (C) Comment continued: Minister of Cooperation Youssef, 
one of the most thoughtful and respected officials in 
Djibouti\'s government, has lived and served as Djibouti\'s 
diplomat in several countries and speaks five languages 
fluently -- French, English, Afar, Arabic, and Somali.  In 
his remarks, he attempted to convey a perspective that is 
deeply-felt and personal.  Yet it is also quite 
representative of the general position of Djibouti, an Arab 
League member, and its largely Muslim citizenry. End comment.

SUBJECT: VISIT OF FRANCE\'S DEFENSE MINISTER TO DJIBOUTI: 
ANXIETY ABOUT U.S. PRESENCE 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) During Ambassador\'s 7/15 meeting with Minister of 
Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mahmoud Ali 
Youssef, Ambassador raised the July 8-9 visit to Djibouti of 
France\'s Defense Minister, Michele Alliot-Marie. 
Alliot-Marie had met during her time in Djibouti with 
President Ismail Omar Guelleh and Djiboutian military 
officials.  She had also visited an education project France 
is funding in Obock and France\'s Ambassador to Djibouti had 
hosted a diplomatic reception in her honor. 
 
2. (C) Youssef told Ambassador that this visit was 
Alliot-Marie\'s third in the past two years.  That, he said, 
is unprecedented in the history of the Djiboutian-French 
post-independence relationship. He said Alliot-Marie sought 
\"reassurances\" from Djibouti on the continuity of 
Djibouti-French relations and seemed clearly worried about 
the implications for that relationship of the U.S. military 
presence at Camp Lemonier.  According to Youssef, 
Alliot-Marie was concerned that Djibouti intended to replace 
France\'s military presence with an American presence. 
 
3. (C) Youssef said his government made clear to Alliot-Marie 
that France and Djibouti enjoy a special relationship and 
that there was no intention to displace France\'s presence. 
The U.S. has a different focus and it is the war against 
terrorism.  He said Alliot-Marie also asked for, and got, 
Djibouti\'s agreement \"in principle\" to obtain a tract of land 
near Camp Lemonier on which to station aircraft and 
accommodate a contingent of service persons.  He said he 
thought she sought guarantees on this issue in order to lock 
in an option for France prior to start of U.S. - Djibouti 
negotiations on access renewal. 
 
4. (C) Youssef said Alliot-Marie\'s request was not the first 
for this tract of land.  Former French Ambassador to Djibouti 
Roussel had asked for the land in January prior to the end of 
his tenure as ambassador. Youssef said there is no written 
agreement between Djibouti and France for the parcel in 
question.  (Comment: Commander of French Forces in Djibouti, 
General Gerard Pons, has made clear to us the interest of 
France\'s military in obtaining use of a tract of land 
adjacent to Camp Lemonier -- described locally as 15 hectares 
-- on which to station some of its aircraft. End comment.) 
 
5.  (U) France has approximately 2,850 service men and women 
in Djibouti and Djibouti is France\'s largest military 
presence outside France. In August, 2003, it agreed to pay to 
Djibouti 30 million euros annually (approximately $36 
million) for use of military facilities in country.  The 
agreement is for ten years. 
 
6. (C) Ambassador raised with Youssef the composition of 
Djibouti\'s delegation for talks on renewal of the U.S. access 
agreement.  Youssef said the composition of Djibouti\'s 
delegation would depend on where talks are held.  If they are 
held in Washington, Ambassador Olhaye would be the 
negotiator.  If they are held in Djibouti, the composition

to hold talks in Washington, in order to maintain 
confidentiality of discussions, for facilitation of language

issues, and because Olhaye has had greater experience in 
working with and understanding Americans.  (Comment: 
Youssef\'s statements would tend to indicate that Washington 
should consider taking the lead and proposing that locale as 
best venue for these negotiations. End comment.)

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI: RESPONSE TO GLOBAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT 
 
REF: STATE 151051 
 
1. (SBU) Per REFTEL, RSO submits the following responses for 
American Embassy Djibouti.  Narratives are keyed to paragraph 
four.  Criteria ratings are denoted in parentheses. 
 
A. Physical Security Upgrades (1) ) Post has recently 
increased its physical security posture by using concrete 
barriers and delta anti-ram barriers, but the lack of setback 
still remains the primary vulnerability.  Post is due to 
break ground on a new NEC in 2007.  Due to Post,s small 
size, all agencies are collocated on the Embassy compound. 
 
B. Chemical/Biological(C/B) Protection (1) ) Post has taken 
protective measures in accordance with Department 
regulations.  RSO recommends that the department research and 
invest in a standard and portable mail-handling container. 
 
C. Technical Security Upgrades (2) ) RSO has no technical 
recommendations.  However, RSO would like to recommend 
baseline technical training for RSOs assigned to lock and 
leave facilities.  Most lock and leave facilities are 
constituent Posts for SEOs and when systems fail it takes 
time for the SEO to arrive to Post leaving the facility 
vulnerable.  In addition, there are many small technical 
issues that an RSO could probably fix on his or her own with 
just a little training subsequently saving the USG, the 
Department, Post, the RSO and SEOs time and money. 
 
D. Armored Vehicle Program (3) ) Post has sufficient armored 
vehicle assets.  Unfortunately, current assets are inadequate 
for environments in underdeveloped countries. Extreme weather 
conditions, poorly maintained roads, non improved surfaces, 
narrow streets, lack of properly trained technicians and lack 
of replacement parts all add up to a vehicle platform that is 
used approximately 50% of the time.  RSO recommends that an 
alternative to the Suburban 4X4 armored platform be fielded 
in the same manner in which the Department acquired and 
fielded the armored BMW sedans. 
 
E. Guard Programs (2) ) Although the Guard Program is by far 
the best security investment Post has, it is also by far one 
of the most time and money consuming programs the RSO 
manages.  Without constant supervision and motivation the 
Guard Force loses its effectiveness and becomes a 
vulnerability rather than a security measure.  RSO recommends 
that at a Post where there is no ARSO a local program manager 
be hired at a grade level commensurate with the intelligence 
and experience required to handle the complexities of the 
culture and the logistics and administrative issues.  This 
would free up the RSO to concentrate on greater security 
concerns such as Emergency preparedness, counter-intelligence 
and counter-terrorism. 
 
F. Surveillance Detection (2) ) RSO recommendation in 
paragraph &E8 would also apply to the SD program. 
 
G. Residential Security (2) ) Although the Residential 
Security program has been effective in mitigating a criminal 
threat, the regulations and applications of security measures 
should be updated to take into consideration the increasing 
threat of terrorism against residential targets. 
 
H. Soft Targets (1) - RSO has no specific recommendations. 
 
I. Briefing Programs (1) ) Post supports arrival and 
refresher briefings. 
 
J. ATA assistance programs (1) ) Without a doubt, the best 
counter-terrorism initiative at Post. 
 
K. Emergency Management Programs (2) ) RSO has no specific 
recommendations other than those already being addressed. 
 
L. RSO Training (2) ) RSO recommends training as outlined in 
paragraph &C8.

1.(U) Action requested at paragraph four. 
 
2. (C) For the second time in three months, most recently 
during a meeting 7/19 at Djiboutian military headquarters, 
the Head of Djibouti\'s Armed Forces, General Fathi Ahmed 
Houssein, raised personally with Ambassador his considerable 
disquiet over the slow pace of acquisition and delivery of 
U.S. military defense equipment requested under the U.S. 
Foreign Military Financing Program (FMF).  Since the dates of 
request by General Fathi for select military items, primarily 
between March and July, 2003, and subsequent Letters of 
Request (LORs), only one Letter of Acceptance (LOA) has been 
signed and none of the requested equipment has been delivered 
or is enroute to Djibouti.  Oustanding equipment for Djibouti 
under FMF are: 
 
-- Heavy Road Construction Equipment (LOR October \'02; LOA 17 
July \'03; only spare parts have begun to arrive in country.); 
- 
-- Reconnaissance Helicopters (LOR 30 July \'03; Awaiting OSD 
decision) 
- 
-- Airfield Radar (LOR 30 July \'03; Received ROM data; 
awaiting Govt. of Djibouti decision) 
- 
-- Coastal Radar (LOR 30 July \'03; Awaiting Technical 
Assessment; Updated LOR 25 March \'04); 
- 
-- Fast Patrol Boats (LOR 30 July \'03; New LOR 14 March 04; 
JVI to take place after assessment visit 30 July) 
- 
-- Toyota Land Cruisers (LOR 9 May \'04; Awaiting LOA; with 
TACOM) 
- 
-- Wheeled Vehicle Package (LOR 30 July \'03; with TACOM) 
- 
-- Spare Parts for Wheeled Vehicles (LOR 30 July 03; with 
USASAC) 
- 
-- Communications Equipment for Wheeled Vehicles (LOR 30 July 
03; with CECOM); 
- 
-- Automation Package (LOR 30 July \'03; with IA) 
- 
-- Small Arms (M4 Carbines, M9 pistols, shot guns, M24 Sniper 
systems, MK19 Grenade Launchers, M2 .50 caliber) (LOR 30 July 
\'03; with TACOM). 
- 
 
3. (C) Reftels relate Djibouti\'s long-standing concern about 
the slow pace of FMF deliveries.  Djibouti has considerable 
International Military Education and Training (IMET) and FMF 
programs. FMF alone currently stands at USD 15.28 million and 
is expected to rise. 
 
4. (C) Action requested:  We are concerned that the slow pace 
of delivery of the equipment Djibouti has requested could 
become a key bilateral issue in upcoming U.S.- Djiboutian 
talks on renewal of access to Camp Lemonier.  The issue is 
already impacting relations with General Fathi at the Embassy 
level.  President Guelleh is also interested in this aspect 
of our military relationship and has requested Department of 
Foreign Affairs involvement in tracking of military 
assistance.  Request urgent DOD - DOS coordinated response 
that Ambassador can use to share with Government of Djibouti, 
and specifically General Fathi, that might allay concerns 
being expressed to us on the issue of FMF delivery.

 1. (U) Following Ambassador\'s July 28 briefing to Major 
General of the Armed Forces, Col. Osman Sobaghleh, on status 
of FMF cases for Djibouti as outlined in reftel (B), 
Ambassador received a written reply August 4 from General

Subject:  Foreign Military Financing (FMF) 
Ref:  Your unnumbered letter, 29 July 2004 
- 
I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 29 July 2004 
regarding the FMF intended for the Djiboutian Armed Forces. 
- 
I thank you especially for the good presentation of this 
program and its updating.  I am convinced that such an 
approach goes in the direction of reinforcing the already 
profitable relations between our two countries. 
- 
However, I regret to note that the delay in putting into 
place of the funds and that by consequence, the materials 
have not yet arrived at their destination.  We feel a major 
concern about these excessive delays in delivery of these 
materials. 
- 
Referring to the state of the program that you submitted to 
me, permit me to transmit to you, in return, the necessary 
observations that I have found: 
 
- The heavy engineering equipment for road construction is 
pending for a year and a half now. 
- 
- Training with members of CJTF-HOA is proceeding slowly. 
- 
- In June, the Toyota Land Cruiser vehicles were requested to 
be replaced with Land Rovers. 
- 
- Regarding parts and equipment for vehicles, the letters of 
acceptance DJ-B-BAL and DJ-B-BAM have already been signed and 
were sent in July, 2004. 
- 
- The air radar system was proposed in the summer for common 
use with U.S. forces in Djibouti and we wish to carry out 
this program with MARCENT (sic) Command in Bahrain. (Embassy 
comment: General Fathi seems to be confusing two separate 
potential projects.  In recent conversations with USLO Chief, 
General Fathi expressed a desire to develop joint programs 
for both air field radar at Camp Lemonier/Ambouli Airfield 
and coastal radar.  Fathi was told that such programs would 
likely have to be coordinated through MARCENT (for airfield 
radar) and NAVCENT (i.e. Bahrain) for coastal radar.  End 
comment) 
- 
- For the five fast high-speed motorboats and patrol craft, a 
delegation has already been assigned for the project.  We are 
still waiting for an answer. 
- 
- For the Obock Naval Base, the commission arrived in July 
and began its study, and we would like that the work begin 
quickly. 
- 
- Regarding Hummer vehicles, we note that the delivery period 
of 24 months is too long and we are in dire need of them for 
territorial security. 
- 
- The renovation of the frontier border stations has been the 
subject of a recent study to evaluate the work needed and we 
wish that this begin rather quickly. 
- 
- The reconnaissance helicopters are on continuing on standby. 
- 
However, as you have well underscored, the global war on 
terrorism is growing day by day and always with new facets. 
- 
Security of maritime coasts and land borders are of cardinal 
importance, and the mixed patrols between our two forces 
began some time ago. 
- 
This is why I have the honor to ask you to intervene with the 
appropriate authorities, as you have done before, in order 
that the process of funding and acquisition be accelerated so 
that our units are able to ensure their mission to protect 
and secure host forces present within the territory, within 
the framework of the global war on terrorism. 
- 
Our common concern today remains the security of host forces, 
and my responsibility as General of the Army pushes me to 
personally ask you that these materials get to us rather 
quickly, as it is the crux of the mission to which we are 
dedicated. 
Best regards, 
General Fathi Ahmed Houssein

3. (C) Comment:  Ambassador appreciates reassurances given 
during her recent consultations at DSCA and DOD.  She 
continues to urge that processing and delivery of FMF 
materiel to Djibouti be expedited as much as possible.  With 
a new implementing arrangement in the process of negotiation 
by DOD for the U.S. military presence in Djibouti, it will 
behoove us, for purposes of leverage, to be as responsive as 
we can to the requests Djibouti has put forward.  End

percent completion of the medians. THE U.S. Navy recently 
contracted two additional storage tanks, two outbuildings for 
storage of drums and diving equipment and a facility for 
security dogs. END SUMMARY 
 
2.(U) The Ambassador, accompanied by the acting Poloff and 
the Economic Assistant, paid a follow-up visit to Doraleh 
port on July 28. Host for the visit was K.K. Menon, site 
manager of the project for Emirates National Oil Company 
(ENOC). 
 
3. (SBU) The port showed marked progress in completion of the 
1080-meter causeway, the outer walls and the storage tank 
areas. Menon is confident that the U.S. Navy\'s four fuel 
storage tanks, edible oil tank, deblasting tank and asphalt 
tank will be ready on or before the contractual deadline of 
June 2005. Accord to Menon, the U.S. Navy has also contracted 
with ENOC to build two outbuildings for drum storage and 
diving equipment and a facility for security dogs. The 
350-meter ship jetty and the oil terminal will also open in 
June 2005, with the container portion of the port to follow. 
 
4. (U) Construction at the port site recently moved to 
round-the-clock and an additional 200 employees will arrive 
at the site next month, bringing the total of ENOC 
contractors to 450. About 90 percent of the materials 
necessary for the oil terminal have also arrived. The 
exception is an integral generator part from U.S.-based 
Caterpillar, Inc. for which delivery will take up to a year. 
Menon expressed dissatisfaction with the delay but has made 
provisions to put in place a temporary part for the generator 
in order not to affect the terminal\'s opening. 
 
5. (SBU) Although the U.S. Navy remains the only contracted 
storage tank lessee at the port thus far, Menon told the 
Ambassador that ENOC has been contacted by Shell Oil about 
erecting tanks that will stand separate from the rest of the 
oil terminal. Total, according to Menon, would use tanks 
currently under construction in a shared area. He said he was 
not been contacted by Mobil.

------------ 
Introduction 
------------ 
1. Good management and foreign assistance have greatly 
contributed to a healthier economy in Djibouti.  Hosting the 
COMESA conference in 2005 will give the Government of 
Djibouti (GOD) an opportunity to promote its liberal 
economic regime and the port of Doraleh, which is expected 
to jump start trade in the region.  The fishing port was 
conceded to foreign management and the railway company is 
following in its footstep.  IGAD\'s main achievement 
continues to be its sustained role in the positive 
development of both the Somali and Sudanese peace 
processes. 
 
-------------------------- 
Major Economic Development 
-------------------------- 
2. Amarreh Ali, Chief Economist at the Ministry of Finance 
and Economy, holds that vigorous management and financial 
aid from the USG and France have significantly ameliorated 
Djibouti\'s economy.  It has resulted in the first positive 
real growth (3.5%) in more than a decade.  Also, strong 
partnership with the IMF led to a Staff Monitored Program 
(SMP) for the year 2004.  The SMP consists of an informal 
agreement between GOD and IMF staff to monitor the 
implementation of the GOD\'s economic program for a period of 
one year.  This SMP will follow up the completion of the 
reforms required by the IMF in the first Enhanced Structural 
Adjustment Facility (ESAF), in particular.  There will also 
be some additional measures such as a Code of Commerce and a 
Labor Code.  The Memorandum of Economic and Financial 
Policies (MEFP) signed between the IMF and the GOD contains 
a detailed list of tasks.  The GOD is required to prepare 
progress reports on a regular basis.  The SMP is expected to 
restore GROD\'s credibility to the donors. 
 
3. Moreover, the IMF validated the GOD Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Papers (PRSPs) in June 2004.  The PRSP aims at 
reducing poverty and unemployment by improving living 
conditions for all the population.  This document was 
elaborated with the contributions of government agencies, 
civil societies, trade unions and private sector 
representatives.  It offers a comprehensive strategic 
framework to be implemented over horizons, 2006, 2010 and 
2015.  Improvements in the medium range include: reduction 
of the extreme poverty rate of 42.25% in 2002 to 36.1% by 
2006; sustained real GDP growth average to 4.6% during 2004- 
2006; increase of the schooling rate of 42.7% in 2002 to 73% 
by 2006; and decrease of infant death rate from 103.1 per 
1000 to 75 per 1000 by 2006.  Malik Garad, Chief Economist 
at the Central Bank, indicated that a consultative meeting 
of international organizations is scheduled for December 
2004 to prepare for a donors round table to be held in the 
first quarter of 2005. 
 
----------------------- 
Major Trade Development 
----------------------- 
4. In June 2004, the \"Societe Djiboutienne du Terminal 
Vraquier\" (STDV) owned by a Saudi Investor, started the 
construction of a bulk grain terminal at the port of 
Djibouti.  This project consists of two warehouses for 
grains and fertilizers, 12 packing units and two large 
cranes.  It should be completed in two years and has the 
objective of speeding up the unloading of food aid and 
fertilizers, which will make the port more competitive. 
 
5. The construction of a new port in Doraleh remains the 
most important project in Djibouti.  The project includes 
three phases: 1) an oil terminal, 2) a container terminal 
and 3) a large commercial/industrial free zone. The GOD 
awarded management of its ports to Dubai Port Authorities, 
which considers Doraleh Port as an extension of Dubai port. 
The oil terminal is expected to be operational by June 
2005.  Seawater depth of more than twenty meters will allow 
Doraleh Port to accommodate fourth generation ships carrying 
up to 8,000 containers.  The GOD is convinced that this 
investment will generate tremendous economic benefits to the 
country.  Please read ref B for more details on the oil 
terminal. 
 
6. Tenders for the Livestock Project are scheduled for 
August 2004 according to Mohamed Omar, Secretary General at 
the Chamber of Commerce. Livestock from the region, but 
mainly from Somalia/Somaliland and Ethiopia, would be 
quarantined in Djibouti and shipped to Gulf countries.   The 
GOD is discussing intensely with the Gulf Countries the 
possibility of lifting the ban on livestock from the 
region.  The project site, which covers 300 acres, is 
situated near the border with Somaliland to allow animals to 
be delivered by trucks.  Animals from Ethiopia could either 
come by truck or by railroad.   The project includes a pre- 
quarantine inspection area, a quarantine facility and a pre- 
shipping final inspection plot located at the port. 
Ron Omar, Livestock Project Coordinator at the Ministry of 
Commerce, is satisfied that this USAID funded project should 
become operational by the end of 2004. 
 
------ 
COMESA 
------ 
7. By hosting the COMESA Conference in 2005, the GOD intends 
to promote its liberal economic regime and the Port of 
Doraleh.  During its presidency in 2005, the GOD is 
determined to convince COMESA countries that Djibouti is the 
natural gateway to their market. 
Djibouti would like especially to attract land locked 
countries such as Uganda, Malawi and Rwanda.  Unlike most 
COMESA countries, Djibouti does not have an agriculture base 
but has to rely on services.  Abdoulrazak Idriss, COMESA 
Focal Point at the Ministry of Commerce, said that the 
adoption of a common external tax policy remained the main 
issue covered in the last COMESA Conference held in Uganda 
in June 2004.  A number of countries have not finalized 
studies of the impact of this new tax policy on their 
individual economies.  For instance, Djibouti gets 24% of 
its GDP from tax income so it needs a clear measurement of 
the impact of this new tax policy.  Mr. Idriss said Djibouti 
is not well integrated in the COMESA partly because most of 
the COMESA state members are English speaking, which causes 
a problem of communication.  He added that the Djiboutian 
business community is not well informed about the 
opportunities offered by COMESA. 
 
---- 
IGAD 
---- 
8. Continued efforts from IGAD greatly contributed to 
positive developments in the peace process both in Sudan and 
Somalia.  As a result, the Sudanese government and the Sudan 
People People\'s Liberation Movement signed a power sharing 
agreement in May 2004.  The Somali National Reconciliation 
Conference (SNRC), held in Kenya is in its last phase of 
seat attributions in the new Parliament.  The African Union 
agreed with IGAD in sending observers and a peacekeeping 
force in Somalia if a new government is established in 
Mogadishu.  In an effort to assist the SNRC, IGAD organized 
a two-day conference in Djibouti for the Somali business 
community on July 21 - 22, 2004 to obtain its commitment to 
support financially a new government in Somalia.  Other IGAD 
activities included the reappointment of Dr.Attala Hamad 
Bashir, IGAD Executive Secretary, for a second term, the 
validation of a five year (2004-2008) strategy, the 
reinforcement of the Conflict Early Warning and Response 
Mechanism (CEWARN), preparation of a regional strategy on 
terrorism and mainstreaming gender in the SNRC.  Finally, 
IGAD continued also to work in its core priorities such as 
desertification and food security. 
 
----------------------------- 
Country Privatization Efforts 
----------------------------- 
9. Serious financial and technical difficulties caused by 
old machinery and harsh competition from Ethiopian trucking 
companies led the GOD and Ethiopia, the Railway co-owners to 
the decision to concede the company to foreign management 
for a transitional two-year period.  On July 22, 2004, the 
Board of Directors pre-selected six foreign firms, which 
will soon receive the tender.  The European Union, which has 
been holding back an approved 40 million Euro grant (approx. 
USD 48.6 million) for many years is planning to release the 
funding during the transitional period to modernize the 
Railway Company. 
 
10. In April 2004, the GOD conceded its fishing port to a 
private firm, Djibouti Maritime Management Investment 
(DMMI).  DMMI\'s objective is to maximize existing fish 
production capabilities of the port to satisfy the local 
market first.  Then, DMMI plans to eventually target markets 
in the Arab Gulf States, Europe and USA. 
 
---- 
AGOA 
---- 
11. No exports were made as a result of AGOA because of the 
lack of factories in Djibouti.  However, the port of Doraleh 
represents a huge potential for AGOA.

Omar Djama, head of American affairs in the Bilateral 
Relations department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

should be condemned and were not in line with the peaceful 
nature of Islam.  He commented that perhaps at the next 
meeting of the Arab League, the countries might propose an 
official statement.  Poloff then asked if the Government of 
Djibouti would be considering making a public statement 
against the terrorist actions in Iraq individually.  Djama

GUELLEH 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Summary: Congressman Donald Payne and HIRC Ted Dagne 
met with President Ismael Omar Guelleh 9 August 2004 during a 
visit to the Horn of Africa region.  Poloff and Charge 
Gribbin accompanied.  Payne and Guelleh discussed regional 
stability, prospects for Somalia peace accords, the 
Eritrea/Ethiopian border dispute and the Darfur situation. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Guelleh began the meeting by summarizing the regional 
situation, saying that it had been struggling for decades 
against poverty, famine, and civil war.  He continued that is 
has been and remains Djibouti\'s first priority to stabilize 
the region.  Guelleh said the situation between Ethiopia and 
Eritrea is an issue of sensitivity and emotions, but with 
good will on both sides hopefully the situation will be 
resolved and thousands of displaced persons could return 
home.  Afterwards reconstruction and rehabilitation could 
begin.  He commented that each year $200 million is spent to 
keep UN peacekeepers on the border, money which could be used 
to help the people of the region.  Guelleh commented that 
Eritrea has real famine in that region.  On Somalia, Guelleh 
commented that the peace process will hopefully solve the 
problems of power sharing and provide a starting point for 
the transitional government.  He said it was necessary to put 
pressure on and money into Somalia, taking out the weapons 
and demobilizing and disarming the warlords.  Guelleh 
commented that reaching small, rural villages, AIDS and 
illiteracy were still large problems that would need to be 
improved in order to better the situation in Somalia. 
 
3. (C) Guelleh then said Djibouti was happy to have American 
forces present and to have participated in the fight against 
terrorism.  He commented that there have been very successful 
operations in 2002 and 2003 to stop the flow of persons 
trying to reach Somalia, which have resulted in improved 
maritime security and an end to piracy.  However, he 
continued, Yemen is still not stable and the movement of 
people from Pakistan and the Gulf countries to East Africa is 
a difficult problem for intelligence and armed forces. 
Guelleh stated that Djibouti wants to use its strategic 
position to contribute to international peace security. 
Guelleh then mentioned the cooperation between USAID and GODJ 
in developing education and health, saying both programs have 
had good progress.  Congressman Payne replied that he was 
pleased that Djibouti is stable, appreciates the welcome and 
open arms given to the American presence, and looks forward 
to continued cooperation with Djibouti. 
 
4. (SBU/NF) When asked by Congressman Payne about Somalia 
peace process and Somaliland, Guelleh replied that Somalia 
was probably the only country in Africa that could be titled 
a \"nation,\" based on its common race, culture, religion and 
language, and that Djibouti believes in the unity of Somalia. 
 He said Djibouti has social and economic ties to Somaliland 
because they are our neighbors and relatives, but Djibouti 
has always been for one Somalia.  Guelleh said that there is 
a movement calling for a presidential candidate from 
Somaliland and that may be a solution that could work. 
Guelleh said that the clans that make up Somaliland are half 
in the North and half in the South, and this might be a 
reason a Somalilander president could succeed.  If it did 
succeed, he said, it would be a very big change. 
Powersharing between the clans is the only way to peace. 
 
5. (U) As for Guelleh\'s suggestions on the Ethiopia/Eritrea 
border disputes, Guelleh said that Ethiopia had not rejected 
the decision, but wants to be sure that the demarcation was 
both practical and humanitarian and would be an end to the 
fight between the countries.  He also said that Eritrea feels 
that the international community is against them.  Payne 
replied that President Isaias of Eritrea has taken the 
awarding of Badme to Eritrea as the final decision and does 
not want more discussion and these sorts of corrections 
should have been made during the process.  Guelleh said the 
decision of the Hague is non-negotiable, a fact that the 
Ethiopians are aware of, but they feel practicality and 
humanitarian needs should be taken into account prior to 
demarcation. 
 
6. (U) Elaborating on Sudan, Guelleh said that it is 
necessary to determine who is Janjaweed who are Chadians 
hired by the Janjaweed and put pressure from a firm 
international community on them to stop.  He felt that if the 
parties cooperate there could be a resolution within two 
months.  Convincing people to go home from the camps may take 
longer however.

DJIBOUTI 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Summary: Congressman Donald Payne and HIRC Ted Dagne 
met with French Ambassador to Djibouti, Philip Selz, 9 August 
2004 during a visit to the Horn of Africa region.  Poloff and 
Charge Gribbin accompanied.  Payne and Selz discussed the 
recent French decision to transport aid into Darfur and the 
U.S./French cooperation in Djibouti.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Payne commented that the aims of the USG and France 
were the same, increase stability and improving the lives of 
the people of the region.  He also said he looked forward to 
cooperation between the U.S. and France in Chad and Sudan. 
Payne continued that there was disappointment in the American 
legislature at the lack of a sense of urgency concerning 
Darfur throughout the international community.  Elaborating 
on that point he commented that many in the international 
community feel that 30 days is to soon a deadline for a 
resolution without realizing that this problem has been going 
on for over a year.  Payne said that he was glad to see the 
French willing to help and perhaps that would get the 
international community to start acting. 
 
3. (C) Selz replied that France agrees with the Security 
Council\'s resolution but does not think the 30 day deadline 
will be met because the Sudanese government doesn\'t want to 
reign in the Janjawide.  Selz continued that the French feel 
it is more important that the month deadline result in a 
change of orientation and attitude among the Sudanese 
government.  He said from there we can hope that it begins 
taking action against the Janjawide in order to establish 
peace and provide humanitarian aid.  Selz repeated that the 
time frame given by the Security Council resolution is short. 
 Payne commented that the same message had been given to the 
Government of Sudan by Secretary Powell and UN Secretary 
General Kofi Annan over the pass few months, in reality 
giving it much more than 30 days to act. 
 
4. (U) On the French/American cooperation in Djibouti, Selz 
commented that though their reasons for having a presence in 
Djibouti differed the two countries share the same objective 
in the Global War on Terror.  Selz said one aspect of the 
Franco-American relations that could be improved was the 
exchange of intelligence regarding terrorism and security 
issues.  He stated that with the small amount of information 
given by the American military regarding a threat, it is 
difficult to appraise and evaluate the threat to the French 
population.  Selz commented that due to the nature of the 
threat in this region, the security situation could be 
slightly jeopardized by the lack of coordination between the 
armed forces present.  However, Selz did applaud the 
coordination that has been started among the donor countries 
in Djibouti on the education and health development programs. 
 
5. (C)  When asked what economic interests France had in 
Djibouti, Selz responded that aside from the French military 
community there were a number of import/export and 
transshipping companies and Total Oil, one of the three major 
oil suppliers in Djibouti.  Selz commented that all three 
companies will be facing a large problem posed by the 
Government of Djibouti\'s order to move to the new port 
facility within one year.  Selz said there is a lack of 
discussion between the Government and the companies.  He said 
he expected big problems in the coming months regarding this 
issue.

SUBJECT: CODEL PAYNE MEETING WITH DJIBOUTIAN MINISTER OF 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Summary: Congressman Donald Payne and HIRC Ted Dagne 
met with Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Abdi Farah, 9 
August 2004 during a visit to the Horn of Africa region. 
PolOff and Charge Robert Gribbin accompanied Payne to 
meetings with the Minister, President Guelleh (septel), and 
French Ambassador Philip Selz (septel).  Payne discussed the 
situation in Darfur, development and the Global War on Terror 
with the Minister. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Payne met first with Director of Bilateral Relations 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mohamed Ali Hassan. 
Hassan told Congressman Payne that Djibouti has seen 
strengthened relations with the USG in the recent years.  He 
commended civil affairs actions in the remote regions of 
Djibouti saying it is important to connect with the American 
military and have interaction in daily life.  Hassan said it 
was good to see expanded political, economic and social 
relations, as well as the return of USAID\'s development 
programs.  Hassan said that much of this was due to the work 
of the Djiboutian Embassy in Washington and the American 
Embassy in Djibouti.  Payne agreed that Djibouti\'s Ambassador 
Olhaye had been very effective in lobbying for legislation 
that was reflective of the needs of African nations and that 
he was well respected and active in his capacity as 
representative to the United Nations. 
 
3. (SBU) Hassan discussed briefly the impact the recent shift 
in attention to smaller countries in Africa has had on 
relations with the United States.  He commented that the 
level of activity and number of seminars specific to African 
problems has increased and has shown a greater interest in 
African nations.  Hassan noted that the translation of 
documents into French allowed a greater number of Francophone 
Africans to more clearly understand the issues and objectives 
of American foreign policy.  Hassan also commented that the 
American military presence in Djibouti has increased the 
level of interest Djiboutians have in working and interacting 
with Americans and learning English. 
 
4. (U) Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Abdi Farah, spoke in 
Somali and French using Hassan as translator for the 
Congressman.  Farah emphasized the appreciation the GODJ has 
for American actions to support and advance relations with 
Africa, especially its friendship with Djibouti.  He 
commented that relations with the U.S. are excellent and GODJ 
is grateful for the significant assistance in health, human 
resources and education.  Farah also commended the USAID 
assistance targeted at making Djibouti a center for cattle 
distribution in the region, which he said would reinforce 
Djibouti\'s economy and advance its role in the region. 
 
5. (C) Farah stated that the GODJ was grateful for the 
efforts made and will of the USG to fight against terrorism. 
He stated that it was a blind terrorism and it is necessary 
to fight against it.  GODJ feels that it does not show the 
right face of Islam, is a danger to humanity and considers 
the terrorist criminals that must be fiercely fought.  He 
also expressed Djibouti\'s determination to continue its 
support for the Global War on Terror. 
 
6. (C) When queried by Payne on suggestions to alleviate the 
problems in Darfur, Farah replied that as a member country of 
IGAD Djibouti was one of four countries to intervene in the 
Southern conflict and work towards an signed peace agreement. 
 He said now that the crisis in Darfur has happened, the 
countries of IGAD have taken it as a serious problem.  He 
stated that the American government, the international 
community and now the Arab League are trying to move forward 
and pressure the Sudanese government to stop the genocide in 
Darfur.  Farah stated that at an Arab League Foreign 
Ministers meeting, the League requested that the Government 
of Sudan put a stop to the situation in Darfur.  He was very 
clear that this is a new action for the Arab League to take 
and said it was a positive step in the right direction. 
Farah also stated that the African Union has made a decision, 
which must be implemented, to send African intervention 
forces.  He said it was important to maintain pressure on the 
Sudanese government.  Payne agreed that it is a positive sign 
for the Arab League to make a statement on the issue.

PRESIDENT GUELLEH 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 00585 
 
1. (U) Summary: Questions on the involvement of President 
Ismael Omar Guelleh in the death of French Judge Bernard 
Borel resurfaced due to Guelleh\'s upcoming visit to France. 
Lawyers in the case, reopened in France at the request of 
Borel\'s widow, are said to have expressed a desire to 
question Guelleh while he is in country.  French authorities 
have issued statements saying Guelleh will not be questioned 
based on standard international law regarding diplomatic 
immunity for Heads of States. 
 
2. (U) Issues surrounding the accusations of President Ismael 
Omar Guelleh\'s involvement in the alleged murder of French 
Judge Bernard Borel in 1995 arose once again due to President 
Guelleh\'s upcoming trip to France to commemorate the 60th 
anniversary of Allied landings in Provence in World War II. 
An investigation is open in France regarding the Judge\'s 
death at the request of his widow. 
 
3. (U) Lawyers involved in this investigation are said to 
want Guelleh to be questioned while in France.  The French 
Foreign Ministry has issued statements to French and 
International press agencies asserting the diplomatic 
immunity for President Guelleh during the August 14 - 16th, 
commenting that \"it is a fundamental principle of 
international law.\" 
4. (U) The 11 August issue of La Nation, Djibouti\'s national 
paper, ran the statement of French Ambassador to Djibouti, 
Philippe Selz, regarding this matter.  Selz\'s statement 
reinforced the idea of not commenting on investigations that 
are underway and emphasized that documents declassified in 
April 2004 did not indicate, nor imply, the involvement of 
the Djiboutian Head of State.  Selz commented that the 
Djiboutian authorities and Department of Justice have given 
the French investigators complete cooperation in this matter. 
 Selz ended his statement with a rebuttal aimed at comments 
heard on a French radio station that France will be 
embarrassed to have invited President Guelleh saying, \"France 
will be honored by the presence of President Guelleh at the 
15th of August ceremonies.\"

SUBJECT: RAILROAD UNIONISTS PROTESTS LATE SALARY 
 
1. (U) Summary:  Members of the Djibouti-Ethiopian Railway 
(CDE) union staged two protests the week of August 15th-19th. 
 Protests on Sunday, August 15th and Wednesday, August 18th 
were peaceful and did not result in any arrests.  The most 
apparent cause of this week\'s protests is the late payment of 
salaries for several months.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Sunday, August 15th approximately 100-200 railroad 
workers marched from the Djibouti City train station to the 
Ministry of Transportation in a peaceful demonstration.  The 
workers were angry at not having received salary payments for 
the month of July.  The protest dispersed quickly.  No 
arrests were made. 
 
3. (U) Wednesday, August 18th railroad union workers staged a 
peaceful strike intending to block the weekly vegetable 
train.  Police intervened and negotiated with the strikers to 
resolve the issue before the train was scheduled to arrive. 
By noontime the strikers and police had seemingly resolved 
the situation and the train was able to enter the station. 
 
4. (U) Conversations with Technical Advisor to the Minister 
of Transport, Mohamed Ali, indicate that the salaries were 
reportedly only one month late and are set to be paid August 
19th.  In response to Poloff query whether the incidents had 
underlying causes, such as the ongoing moves towards 
privatization, Ali said that these incidents were merely 
discontent over salary issues. 
 
5. (U) Continuing on the issue of the privatization of the 
railroad, Ali commented that six companies have been 
short-listed for the concession of the Djibouto-Ehtiopian 
Railway.  The concession is part of a 40 million Euro project 
financed by the European Union to privatize the railroad and 
turn it over to a private investor.  Ali said the 
announcement of the winning bid in the concession tender is 
expected for the beginning of 2005.  Of the six companies 
short-listed, two are American: African Initiative 2020 and 
Canac, a Canadian railway company that was recently sold to 
Savage Companies in early 2004.  Dubai Ports International, 
managers of the current Port of Djibouti, Djibouti 
International Airport and the new Doraleh Port Facility under 
construction also appeared on the short list.

4. (U) THE POLICE VICE SQUAD \"BRIGADE DES MOEURS\" AND THE

CHILD LABOR IN ADDIS ABABA, WHICH HAS REQUESTED A CENSUS OF 
CHILD LABOR IN DJIBOUTI.  THE MINISTRY PLANS TO CARRY OUT 
THIS CENSUS IN THE COMING MONTHS.

5. (U) OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRY OF YOUTH, THE MINISTRY OF 
INTERIOR, THE MINISTRY OF WOMEN PROMOTION AND FAMILY WELL- 
BEING, THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, AND THE MINISTRY OF LABOR 
ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT CHILDREN LIVING IN DIFFICULT 
CONDITIONS.  AS A RESULT, THE GOD FINALIZED ITS POVERTY 
REDUCTION STRATEGY PAPERS (PRSP) IN JUNE 2004.  THE PRSP 
AIMS AT REDUCING POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT BY IMPROVING 
LIVING CONDITIONS FOR ALL THE POPULATION.  GOVERNMENT 
MINISTRIES, CIVIL SOCIETIES, TRADE UNIONS AND PRIVATE SECTOR 
REPRESENTATIVES CONTRIBUTED TO THE ELABORATION OF THIS 
DOCUMENT.  IT OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK TO 
BE IMPLEMENTED OVER HORIZONS 2006, 2010 AND 2015. 
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MEDIUM RANGE INCLUDE: REDUCTION OF THE 
EXTREME POVERTY RATE OF 42.25% IN 2002 TO 36.1% BY 2006; 
SUSTAINED REAL GDP GROWTH AVERAGE TO 4.6% DURING 2004-2006; 
INCREASE OF THE SCHOOLING RATE OF 42.7% IN 2002 TO 73% BY 
2006; AND DECREASE OF INFANT DEATH RATE FROM 103.1 PER 1000 
TO 75 PER 1000 BY 2006. 
 
6.   (U) A Law passed in 2000 makes the school compulsory 
until the age of sixteen. Gross enrollment rates have risen 
from approximately 38% in 1998 to approximately 53% in 2003. 
This is a very low rate compared to the 85% average for Sub- 
Saharan countries and given that Djibouti\'s population is 
70% urban. There are some 65,000+ school-aged children not 
currently attending school. The ministry of education 
outlined a long-term perspective plan, which aims for 80% 
enrollment for the primary school by the year 2010.  This 
plan will also provide a system for tracking the progress of 
each individual child and will hold the school headmaster 
responsible for finding out why a child has left school. In 
September 2004, the Ministry of Education will launch a 
program aimed at increasing the numbers of nomadic children 
attending schools by raising community awareness and 
involvement. 
7. (U) The Government of Djibouti has created a National 
Policy for Youth in order to prevent children who are not in 
school from becoming delinquent.  The program focuses on 
community involvement and promotion of Community Development 
Centers to provide activities for the children.  The 
Community centers also act as reading rooms for children in 
school to do homework and study. 
 
--------------------- 
CHILD LABOR SITUATION 
--------------------- 
8. (U) NO STATISTICS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE 
CHILD LABOR SITUATION IN DJIBOUTI.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME 
INDICATIONS THAT LAST YEAR\'S MASSIVE TURNING BACK OF ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS HAVE REDUCED CHILD LABOR.  IN URBAN AREAS, 
CHILDREN ARE VERY ACTIVE IN THE INFORMAL ECONOMIC 
ACTIVITIES.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A COMPLETE LIST OF 
THEIR ACTIVITIES BUT THEY MOSTLY WORK AS SHOE CLEANERS, CAR 
WASHERS, KAT SELLERS OR DOMESTIC SERVANTS.  SOME OF THESE 
CHILDREN BECOME BEGGARS OR STREET PROSTITUTES.  IN RURAL 
AREAS, CHILDREN HELP THEIR PARENTS IN AGRICULTURAL OR 
LIVESTOCK CHORES.  MOST OF THESE CHILDREN ARE DISPLACED FROM 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND HAVE NO OTHER MEANS OF INCOME. 
TWO ORPHANAGE CENTERS ACCOMMODATE ABANDONED CHILDREN, STREET 
CHILDREN AND CHILDREN FROM VERY POOR FAMILIES.  THESE YOUTHS 
ARE PROVIDED WITH SHELTER, EDUCATION AND HEALTH COVERAGE. 
ALSO, SOME LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS GIVE 
SHELTER, FOOD AND EDUCATION TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF STREET 
CHILDREN. 
 
 
---------- 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
9. (U) DJIBOUTI DOES NOT HAVE ANY COMPREHENSIVE POLICY AIMED 
AT REDUCING THE WORST FORM OF CHILD LABOR BECAUSE IT DOES 
NOT SEE IT AS A PROBLEM.  THE GOD ALLOCATES ITS MEAGER 
RESOURCES TO THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY, WHICH REMAINS A 
PRIORITY. THE REHABILITATION OF DJIBOUTI\'S EDUCATION 
INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE A STEP TOWARDS REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF 
CHILD LABOR PRESENT IN THE ECONOMY.

Classified By:  CDA: REGribbin for reasons 1.5 b&d 
 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. Representatives Jeff Miller, John Boozman, 
Tom Cole and Madeleine Bordallo spent six productive hours in 
Djibouti on August 23.  They left with a solid appreciation 
of the  situation in the country and region and of U.S. 
undertakings here. End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The country team discussed U.S./Djibouti relations 
with the codel stressing that the current excellent state of 
ties is based on coinciding interests: that of the U.S. in 
combating terrorism in the region and of Djibouti\'s 
willingness - for a price - to be the platform for such a 
presence.  The representatives were pleased with the growing 
depth of cooperation on the military front, but also with the 
USG focus on economic and social issues, especially education 
and health via USAID projects. 
 
3. (SBU) The visitors toured Camp Lemonier, lunched with 
constituents, and were briefed on CJTF-HOA\'s mission and 
objectives in the region. The heat - about 120 degrees - 
underscored the difficulty of living and working conditions 
in the Horn of Africa. Certainly a highlight for 
Representative Bordallo was the discovery of a whole company 
of soldiers from Guam. General Helland and his staff 
discussed various community development projects relating to 
schools, wells and livestock in Yemen, Ethiopia and Kenya as 
well as Djibouti in order to make the point that such 
face-to-face encounters, done in the company of host country 
counterparts, achieved the objective of presenting the U.S. 
in a positive light. The delegation visited the primary 
school at Doudah (near the base, but unfortunately located 
near the city dump) that was renovated as part of Camp 
Lemonier\'s Community outreach program. 
 
4. (S) The representatives were also briefed on the nature of 
the terrorist threat in the region, U.S. efforts to identify 
it and cooperation with Djiboutian and other national 
authorities in countering it. One of the visitors asked, at 
least partially rhetorically, if such a US presence as 
exemplified by the Camp generated or mitigated the threat? In 
another comment, prior to the military briefing, another 
representative expressed curiosity as to why the U.S. troops 
were so separated from the local population. In light of 
ongoing talk in Washington about intelligence 
re-organization, Congressman Miller asked how CJTF-HOA intel 
concerns might best be served. General Helland stated that as 
a field commander he wanted to be able to task folks 
accountable to him for intelligence products. He observed 
that the existing system served that purpose well. 
 
4. (SBU) Comment: The representatives were mostly in a 
listening mode, but were clearly interested in learning more 
about this far corner of the world and U.S. interests and 
activities here. 
 
5. (U) This message was drafted after the codel\'s departure 
and was not cleared by them.

Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Political Assistant reported to Poloff that rumors 
have been circulating throughout town and within Foreign 
Affairs that changes in Djibouti\'s Embassies abroad will be 
coming soon, possibly as soon as September.  Washington DC, 
Asmara, Addis Ababa, Jeddah and Yemen are rumored to be where 
the changes will occur.  It has been said that Ambassador 
Olhaye, Djiboutian Ambassador to the United States, has been 
out of Djibouti for too long, and will probably be pulled 
from his assignment.  Rumors of who his replacement will be 
indicate that Director of Bilateral Affairs, Mohamed Ali 
Hassan, is expected to be tapped for the position.  Regarding 
Jeddah, rumors say Mohamed Aden, current Consul to Jeddah, 
has been making mistakes for many years and most likely will 
come back to Djibouti.  Word on the street is a consulate 
will open in New Delhi, India.  PolAsst said that these 
rumors have been circulating for several weeks, but have 
increased dramatically just recently.  Post will investigate 
these rumors and seek validation of possible changes. 
 
2. (C) COMMENT: Our key interest is, of course, in assuring 
that whoever negotiates for Djibouti regarding the extension 
of base rights does so with the full authority of their 
government.  We judge that Ambassador Olhaye carries/will 
carry that authority even if his tour in Washington/New York

distribute HI! Magazine in flight 
 
1.   (U) SUMMARY: Post today made an agreement with Djibouti 
     Airlines to distribute HI! Magazine as free, in flight 
     reading material. The airline will receive 150 copies 
     monthly to offer to passengers. Negotiations with Daallo, 
     another local carrier, are still pending. END SUMMARY 
 
2.   (U) Post proposed providing a monthly shipment of Hi! 
     Magazine to Djibouti Airlines for distribution as an in- 
     flight periodical. Djibouti Airlines operates out of Dubai, 
     United Arab Emirates and is owned by Moussa Rayleh Waberi, a 
     Djiboutian businessman who also owns Telstat (in partnership 
     with Houssein Bogoreh Bouh and Abdallah Houmed Mohamed). The 
     airline flies to: Aden, Yemen; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; 
     Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; Hargesa, 
     Somalia; and Borama, Somalia. 
 
3.   (U) The majority of patrons of Djibouti Airlines are 
     business or religious travelers to the Middle East and 
     middle class Djiboutians, Ethiopians and northern Somalians 
     (Somalilanders) traveling for business or pleasure. 
 
4.   (SBU) Post hopes this agreement will increase 
     distribution of HI! to the limited number of Arabic speakers 
     in the Horn of Africa by reaching business travelers from 
     the Middle East, as well as middle class travelers in 
     Somalia and southern Ethiopia.  Increased distribution 
     furthers specific MPP goals including influencing public 
     opinion.

SUBJECT: THE MESSAGE IS MISSING 
 
 
Classified By: CDA: REGribbin for reasons 1.5 b&d 
 
 1. (C) Summary. While most elements of the global war on 
terrorism are functioning well in the Horn of Africa, a key 
ingredient - the message in the Somali language to the people 
of the region - is missing. It is time to think again how to 
add this component to the mix. Post suggests Somali language 
broadcasts from the new IBB transmitting facility in 
Djibouti. End summary. 
 
2. (C) As addressees are aware much effort is going into 
learning about and containing the bad guys in this part of 
the world. Those charged with that responsibility are doing 
well. Additionally, programs included in the East Africa 
Counter Terrorism Initiative (EACTI) are doing their part to 
improve the counter-terrorism capabilities of HOA nations. 
Finally under both State/USAID and military aegis, 
development, grass roots and humanitarian projects are 
winning the hearts and minds of local communities. What is 
missing, however, is a wider communications effort designed 
to bring the message of friendship, non-confrontation with 
Islam and peace to the masses, especially Somali speakers who 
are the hosts, the recruits and the supporters of inimicable 
elements. Secondly, we judge that as the politics of Somalia 
and Somaliland mature, it behooves us to be better placed to 
foster the evolution of the sort of governments and polices 
conducive to global norms. Accomplishment of this will be 
difficult without a better means of communication to decision 
makers. 
 
3. (C) Despite the excellent public relations products 
produced by regional embassies and CJTF-HOA, we doubt if much 
American generated information gets through to Somali 
speakers, who are found in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia\'s Ogaden 
and Djibouti. Although Radio Sawa in Arabic now broadcasts 
from Djibouti, its transmissions are oriented towards the 
Arab world and, even though in the language of the mosques, 
they are largely unheard and poorly understood in the Horn of 
Africa. What we need is equivalent programming in the Somali 
language as well as the ability to tailor messages 
specifically to the circumstances in the Horn. We used to 
have some of this in VOA\'s Somali service. Now is the time to 
resurrect it if we are to have a solid chance to form 
attitudes in the region in a positive direction. Right now, 
America\'s absence from the radio airways concedes influence 
to the radicals, especially in regions where the USG has no 
community relations work on the ground. Let there be no doubt 
that our opponents capitalize on this advantage. 
 
4. (C) We have thought about several means to rectify the 
situation. First, we would not be adverse to offering 
government controlled Radio Djibouti an hour or so per day of 
U.S. produced programming. Radio Djibouti can be heard in 
Djibouti, the Ogaden and Somaliland. We would caution that 
this service and the GODj would likely be reluctant to use 
programming that seemed to them to be too political. We 
cannot judge much in advance where they would draw the line, 
but would have a better feel for it after discussions - were 
we authorized to do so. 
 
5. (C) An alternative would be to re-invigorate a daily 
Somali hour or two on VOA broadcasts to the region. 
 
6. (C) A third option would be to add a Somalia aimed 
transmitter to the new Djibouti broadcasting facility built 
for Radio Sawa by IBB and from that beam programming into the 
Horn. This would probably require an amendment to our 
agreement with the GODj, but we believe that is doable. 
Programming for such a station would all be Washington 
generated and merely rebroadcast from here. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  Apparently, this crucial element of the GWOT 
in the Horn of Africa slipped off the screens, but with the 
new installation of the IBB facility in Djibouti it is time 
to revisit it to see what might be done to rectify the 
situation. Please advise.

SUBJECT: DJBOUTIANS\' REGIONAL TRAVEL 
 
1. (U) Summary. September marks the beginning of the school 
year in Djibouti and with it, the return of thousands of 
Djiboutians who have spent the last few months in cooler 
neighboring climes. While historically part of the pattern of 
life, expanded travel indicates growing middle class wealth. 
The negative aspect from a security perspective is that it 
also indicates how easy moving around has become. End summary 
 
2. (U) Historically Djiboutians who could afford it, traveled 
themselves and/or sent their families to cooler inland areas 
from June through August, Djibouti\'s hottest months. This 
predilection to get out of town was re-enforced by the French 
habit of taking leave in August, but rather than go to the 
sea, Djiboutians go to the hills. The Dire Dawa region of 
Ethiopia is a favored destination because it is cooler, many 
Djiboutians have roots and extended families there and khat 
is readily available. Since khat is part of the local 
lifestyle for thousands of Djiboutians, a vacation without 
access to their daily jolt would be unthinkable. Nazreth and 
Addis Ababa are also desired Ethiopian destinations. Hargeysa 
in nearby Somaliland also serves the same purpose. All of 
these destinations can be reached by road as well as air and 
a journey to Dire Dawa can even be accomplished by a rickety 
old train. In all these destinations, Djiboutian oriented 
hotels and activities exist. 
 
3 (U). Djibouti\'s daily paper the Nation reported that a 
destination of choice this summer was Yemen. Sales of air 
tickets were up three-fold. The highlands of Yemen were 
reported to be cheap, cool and with a nice ambiance - also 
khat. On the reciprocal side the paper observed that a good 
number of persons from the Djboutian diaspora in Europe and 
Canada returned home in August to visit. 
 
4. (U) The extent of such regional tourism re-enforces 
extended family links and underscores the interconnectivity 
of folks in this region. For example, this week an embassy 
FSN brought us an appeal from a relative who is a minister in 
the Hargeysa government regarding Somaliland\'s viability. 
Certainly this web of family and friendship, which unites 
people of Somali ethnicity, is widespread. 
 
5. (SBU) Although not reported in the paper, the GODj\'s 
ability to track comings and goings through the airport will 
be greatly enhanced by the installation of the U.S. provided 
Terrorist Interdiction Program system, which is now in final 
testing. However, the land and sea borders remain very porous 
and records, even of those who travel in conformance with 
regulations, are very skimpy.  Thus, increased mobility of 
the citizenry at large also improves the mobility and 
hideability of bad actors.

SUBJECT:  THE MOOD IN SOMALILAND IS DEFIANT, YET 
APPREHENSIVE 
 
1. Summary. An embassy Djibouti FSN recently returned from 
several weeks leave in Hargeisa, Somaliland. He reported an 
active interest there in the Somalia National Reconciliation 
Conference that is taking place in Nairobi, but rejection of 
any effort by the conference or subsequently by the 
international community to subsume the sovereignty of 
Somaliland. Yet Hargeisa\'s mood was also one of apprehension, 
of not knowing what may happen. Additionally, the government 
of Somaliland left the door open a crack stating that it 
would consider dialogue with any new Mogadishu based regime. 
End summary. 
 
2.  Background. British Somaliland became independent on June 
26, 1960 and was acknowledged  by 34 nations, including the 
U.S. Five days later on July 1, it voluntarily joined with 
Italian Somalia to form the Republic of Somalia. The union 
worked satisfactorily until the Siad Barre regime in the 
seventies and eighties cracked down harshly on northerners 
using the full police and military might of the capital. In 
the anarchy that followed Siad\'s demise in 1991, Somaliland 
reclaimed its independence, affirmed by a national 
referendum. A functioning government that controls national 
territory has existed since that time, but the Somaliland 
state has not been recognized by any government. 
 
3. The IGAD led effort to reconstitute a viable government in 
Mogadishu culminated in the Somalia National Reconciliation 
Conference in Nairobi that is just winding up with the 
swearing-in of a Parliament. Selection of a president is 
still to come. On July 17, 2003 when the SNRC was being 
contemplated, the Somaliland Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
endorsed the event and exhorted all factions and groups in 
\"Somalia\" (meaning the former Italian colony) to participate. 
The Ministry added that \"Any claims or declarations of 
sovereignty over Somaliland by a future Somalia authority 
will be viewed by the Government of Somaliland as an 
indication of hostile intent.\" However, it added that 
officials in Somaliland \"do not eliminate the possibility of 
dialogue with Somalia as equal partners.\" 
 
4. Somaliland officials gave our FSN a copy of the July 
17,2003 declaration last week and told him that it remained 
the policy of the government. He was asked to communicate 
this information to embassy Djibouti. A copy of the document 
was faxed to AF/E. 
 
5. Our source reported that the Nairobi Reconciliation 
Conference was the hottest topic in the streets of Hargeisa. 
Youth are ready to take arms to defend their nation whereas 
wiser citizens seek other means to preserve the peace that 
has come in last ten years. Folks displayed sadness over 
non-recognition of Somaliland by the world at large and 
especially efforts by Djibouti to prevent that from 
happening. Most agreed that any undertakings to compel 
Somaliland to unite with Somalia would be unfair and 
rebuffed. 
 
6. Despite this bravado, our source concluded that 
Somalilanders are uncertain about the future and fear that in 
the existing limbo Somaliland\'s territorial integrity and 
sovereignty risk being chipped away. Apparently two of 
Somaliland\'s six regions, Sanag and Sool, are showing signs 
of disunity. Sanag is discontent with Hargeisa\'s rule while 
Sool appears to be shifting its allegiance to Puntland. 
 
7. Comment: Embassy notes that this is second hand reporting. 
Nonetheless, we judge it helps fill the void of information 
about what is going on in Somaliland, so we convey it in that 
spirit.

 2. (SBU) On August 31, 2004 at approximately 1200 hours 
U.S.Military Camp Lemonier in Djibouti was officially 
lockdown because of an alleged IED.  The suspected IED was 
located on the outer perimeter base of the camp.  EOD 
immediately responded and disabled the device.  There were no 
evidence of explosive material, power source or detonator 
found. 
 
3.  (SBU) Interviewed witnesses revealed Host Nation contract 
workers had been working in the vicinity of the alleged 
device.  Preliminary investigations suggest the device belong 
to one of the contract workers and was innocuous in nature. 
 
4.  (U) In the wake of this incident Post is improving its 
communication and reporting procedures with Camp Lemonier. 
 
5.  (SBU) Assessment:  It is more likely than not the device 
was innocuous and was inadvertently place on the fence by a 
Host Country contract worker.  RSO will continue to monitor 
the situation and report as needed.

SUBJECT: Djibouti Speaks Out on Darfur 
 
1. (U) The state run newspaper, La Nation, yesterday 
published a story saying that the Republic of Djibouti will 
support the Government of Sudan until the Darfur crisis is 
resolved. The story indicated that the Sudan situation is 
improving and that progress is being made at the Abuja 
conference. It opposed Western military intervention inside 
the Sudanese frontiers. 
 
2. (U) On August 21 the Minister of Information announced 
Djiboutian support for the Sudanese effort to resolve the 
Darfur crisis. Since then, the state news agency has been 
reporting stories favoring the Sudanese government and 
calling for large scale return of  refugees to Darfur. 
 
4. (U) Comment: This may be partly in response to the visit 
of Rep. Donald Payne paid Djibouti and other countries that 
share a border with Sudan, as well as the nomination of a 
new Sudanese Ambassador to Djibouti. Both urged the 
Djiboutian Government to take an official stand on Darfur. 
More likely it is a reflection of the Arab League stance on 
this issue. Djibouti is a member of the Arab League. 
 
5.  (U) Comment Continued: There is an ethically Sudanese 
community in Djibouti with a long history in the capital. 
The feeling about Darfur in this community, and in the 
Djiboutian society as a whole, is that the American 
government\'s preoccupation with Sudan parallels its stance 
toward Saddam before the current Iraqi war.

SUBJECT: POST RECOMMENDS PASSPORT REQUIREMENT FOR THOSE 
DEPLOYING TO CJTF-HOA 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Because some military members deployed to 
the Combined Joint Task Force- Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), 
Camp Lemonier, Djibouti, are redirected to jobs outside of 
Djibouti in countries that require US passports for entry, 
Post asks DOD to consider requiring all soldiers deploying 
to the CJTF-HOA or JSOTF staff to have a tourist and/or 
official passport before leaving the United States. END 
SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) Under the SOFA with Djibouti, only a military ID is 
required for military air entry into the host nation; 
however, Post\'s consular office processes six to twelve 
passport  applications each month, on average, 
for soldiers at CJTF-HOA who have been temporarily 
assigned to duty in other countries of the Area 
of Responsibility (AOR). Yemen, Eritrea 
and Ethiopia all require U.S. military members to 
present passports for entry. 
 
3. (U) Since September 11, passports cannot/cannot 
be issued from Posts, save emergency one entry passports 
back to the United States. Tourist passport applications 
are sent to the National Passport Center in New Hampshire. 
Official passport applications are sent to the Special 
Issuance Agency in Washington, DC. Processing takes a 
minimum of four weeks. 
 
4. (U) Comment: It has been Post\'s experience that 
the issuance delay negatively impacts CJTF-HOA\'s 
mission, as slots are often left empty until a 
passport can be issued. Post asks that DOD consider 
requiring those who may be deployed 
in AOR countries other than Djibouti to obtain a 
passport before leaving the United States. It is Posts\' 
opinion that this would greatly aid CJTF-HOA\'s 
responsiveness and flexibility.

1. (U) Summary: After a follow-up conversation with Secretary 
General of the Ministry of Energy, Farah Ali Ainan, on the 
NARUC Utility Regulators Conference in Bamako, Mali, Farah 
approached PolOff on possible U.S. assistance in the energy 
and mining sectors. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Secretary General of the Ministry of Energy, Farah Ali 
Ainan, said his recent trip to Mali to attend the Regional 
Coordination Conference and Workshop on Purchase Power 
Agreements and Contract, organized by the National 
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and USAID, 
will prove highly beneficial in many future ventures of the 
Djiboutian government.  Farah commented that he and his 
colleague, Aboulkader Oudoum Abdallah, Head of Climate Change 
and Clean Development at the Ministry of Environment, learned 
an exceptional amount about negotiations with private 
companies.  He added that the information learned in Mali 
will aid the Government of Djibouti in negotiating several 
future projects, including geothermal energy and exploration 
of mineral resources. 
 
3. (U) However, Farah continued, the Ministry of Energy is 
one of the poorest among the Djiboutian ministries and 
infrastructure for studying and developing a national energy 
plan is severely lacking.  Highest on Farah\'s list of the 
Energy Ministry\'s needs was human resources and technical 
training.  Farah  outlined a plan for the energy sector, 
which would provide the Government a better overview of 
renewable energy possibilities.  Farah said that the Ministry 
has come up with several ideas, but lacks the scientific 
training, as well as the funding to carry them out.  Among 
his ideas was setting up an Energy Commission that could help 
guide the Government and the power company, Electricite de 
Djibouti, in the usage and development of Djibouti\'s 
potential energy sources.  Farah added finally that the 
mining sector was another unexploited resource that Djibouti 
possesses and inquired about programs that could help develop 
the industry.  Djibouti has fair quantities of salt, gypsum, 
perlite and dytomite.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTIAN OPPOSITION LEADER DIES 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (U) President of the Djiboutian opposition party 
Republican Alliance for Democracy (ARD), Ahmed Dini Ahmed, 
died during the morning of 12 September 2004 at Peltier 
Hospital.  Dini had been suffering from lung cancer, which 
progressed into metastasis.  President Ismail Omar Guelleh 
reportedly visited Dini at the hospital last week and offered 
medical evacuation to France.  Dini reportedly refused the 
offer and chose to die in Djibouti. 
 
2. (U) President Guelleh sent a message of condolence to 
Dini\'s family, stating that \"the Almighty had recalled our 
brother and fellow citizen.\"  He continued that \"on behalf of 
the nation and myself personally, I am eager to express to 
the family of Ahmed Dini our deepest condolences.\"  Guelleh 
described Dini as a combatant for freedom, and a statesman of 
great qualities who has always known hot to fight for his 
faith and his opinions.  La Nation, the local Djiboutian 
government daily, carried a front page article on what it 
described as the \"disappearance\" of a great figure in 
national politics. 
 
3. (U) BIO: Ahmed Dini Ahmed, 70 years old, has been a 
prominent and important figure in Djiboutian politics since 
the days of colonial administration by France.  Born in the 
northern district of Obock in 1932, Dini began his political 
activity early and was very active in the labor unions.  He 
became a deputy in the Assemblee Territoriale de la Cote 
Francaise (Territorial Parliament) in 1959 and served twice 
as Minister in the territorial government.  Dini then turned 
his efforts towards independence for the country and with 
Hassan Gouled Aptidon, became one of the most ferocious 
opponents of the territorial government from 1967 to 1977. 
When Hassan Gouled Aptidon came to power at independence, 
Dini joined him as Prime Minister.  Approximately one year 
after independence, Dini went into voluntary exile after a 
disagreement with Aptidon.  In 1991, Dini rejoined the 
Djiboutian opposition, rising quickly to the top of the FRUD 
party.  Dini was at the head of the radical wing of the FRUD 
party during the civil war, and refused to sign the 1994 
peace agreements.  However, he did sign the final peace 
accord in 2001.  When the restrictions on how many political 
parties could exist ended, Dini created the opposition party 
Alliance Republicaine pour la Democratie (ARD Republican 
Alliance for Democracy), which has been the pillar at the 
center of the opposition coalition Union pour l\'Alternance 
Democratique (UAD Union for Democratic Alternance). 
 
4. (C) Comment: Pol Asst reported that the sentiment around 
town during the evening of 12 September was fearful.  The 
number of police checkpoints throughout the city was notably 
increased.  (Note: RSO\'s information indicates that this was 
most likely precautionary against public suspicion of foul 
play. End Note.)  Dini was buried just outside of Djibouti 
City at 9pm on 12 September.  The burial was attended by many 
Government officials and a huge number of his family, as well 
as the Sultan of Tadjourah and the traditional leaders of 
Tadjourah. 
 
5. (C) Dini\'s death will have a significant impact on the 
Djiboutian political scene, most especially the political 
face of the opposition. Dini was an integral part of 
Djiboutian politics for more than 50 years.  Dini was also 
known as one of the strongest personalities in the 
opposition.  The succession to Dini\'s position is likely to 
be a struggle between those that see themselves as legitimate 
successors, his family and sons, and those that claim to have 
been Dini\'s companion during his twenty years of exile.  The 
reaction and attitude of the other three opposition parties 
is a factor that also remains uncertain. End Comment.

1. (U) Six International Foundation for Education and 
Self-Help (IFESH) volunteers, consisting of three men and 
three women, arrived September 9 in Djibouti for a 10-month 
assignment to teach English in Djibouti\'s education system. 
They were met at the airport by Momodou Mombouray of IFESH 
headquarters, who is in Djbouti to help the volunteers settle 
in, and Djama Equeh, the newly-recruited IFESH country 
representative.  The arrival of the volunteers is a year-long 
collaborative effort by USAID/Djibouti, IFESH CEO, Dr. Julie 
Sullivan, and Djibouti\'s Ministry of Education.  Strong 
support has come from Minister of Education Abdi Ibrahim 
Absieh.              . 
 
2. (U) Three of the volunteers will be attached to Pole 
University in Djibouti, two to the Ministry of Education 
Research and Material Development units and the Teacher 
Training College, and one to the Industrial and Commercial 
High School of Djibouti.  All volunteers will live in 
Djibouti city.  Most have had extensive experience living and 
teaching in Africa south of the Sahara. 
 
3. (U) Ambassador welcomed the group at her residence for tea 
and discussions about their program.  She noted the 
Government of Djibouti\'s desire to have all its citizens 
learn English, and stressed the need for the volunteers to 
work toward achieving results that are tangible.  She also 
discussed the new English language laboratory that the 
Embassy has recently donated to Pole University.  Also 
present at this event were USAID Representative Janet 
Schulman and USAID Djibouti Basic Education Team Leader Steve 
Dorsey.  While on the Embassy compound, the volunteers 
received a security briefing from the Regional Security 
Officer and, as American citizens, registered at the 
Embassy\'s Consular office. 
 
4. (U) Minister of Education Absieh welcomed the volunteers 
in a huge press and media event on September 12.  Present at 
that event were the Secretary General of the Ministry of 
Education, Directors and Advisors of the Ministry of 
Education, including the President of Pole University, the 
President of the Teacher Training College, and Directors of 
Research, Instruction  and Planning.  During that event, 
USAID representative Schulman expressed her joy and pride in 
seeing the American volunteers in Djibouti and welcome them 
on behalf of USAID.  Minister Absieh stressed the need for 
the volunteers to feel at home, to get to know Djiboutians, 
and asked for their patience as the Ministry completed 
remaining renovations on their permanent housing.  He told 
the volunteers that he was glad to have them in Djbouti and 
would do everything to make their tour a success. 
 
5. (U) The volunteers spent and additional hour with the 
Directors and Advisors of the Ministry of Education 
discussing the Djiboutian education system and learning about 
their individual assignments and programs.  The volunteers 
had already toured parts of Djibouti during their first 
weekend in country, visiting Ali Sabieh to the South, 
Tadjourah to the north and Lake Assal, the scenic salt lake 
and lowest point on the African continent. 
 
6. (U) Funding for the Djibouti English language program is 
approximately USD 400,000 from an AID/W grant to IFESH.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S INTRODUCTORY CALL ON NEW COMMANDER OF 
FRENCH FORCES IN DJIBOUTI 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D.RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (A) AND (D). 
 
 1. (U) Ambassador, accompanied by USLO Chief, had her first 
meeting September 16 with General Michel Arrault, the new 
Commander of French Forces in Djibouti.  Arrault replaced 
General Gerard Pons, whose tour of duty ended August 1. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador noted the close cooperation and 
collaboration between the U.S. and France in Djibouti and the 
weekly meetings she had had with General Pons.  She told 
Arrault, that with his permission, she wished to continue 
this weekly contact.  Arrault concurred and noted that he had 
had the privilege to meet as well General Samuel Helland, 
Commander of the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa 
(CJTF-HOA).  Arrault said he looked forward to working 
closely with us. Ambassador noted the role of the CJTF-HOA in 
the global war on terrorism, but acknowledged the difference 
in function of France\'s military presence in Djibouti. 
Arrault responded that France\'s forces are in Djibouti as 
part of a mutual defense agreement with Djibouti that has 
existed since Djibouti\'s independence.  Its mission is 
therefore different.  Arrault noted that France had, on 
occasion, had the chance to participate with the CTF-150, but 
that its primary role in Djibouti is defense of Djibouti 
rather than the global war on terrorism. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador asked about France\'s military assistance to 
Djibouti, noting our own Foreign Military Financing (FMF) 
program here.  Arrault said France does have training and 
exercise programs with Djibouti but that their direct 
assistance amounts to 30 million euros (approximately USD 45 
million) annually, a figure which is provided through a 
complicated computation that includes rent for France\'s 8 
plus bases in Djibouti, taxes and other duties accruing to 
servicemen, plus cash that would bring any shortfalls on an 
annual basis up to this sum. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador remarked that the U.S. military was in the 
process of negotiating renewal of its Camp Lemonier lease, 
currently assessed at USD 15 million annually.  She noted her 
understanding that France wanted to reserve a portion of land 
near the Camp for use for aircraft parking and staff 
billeting.  She asked if France had reached an agreement with 
Djibouti on this issue.  Arrault responded that France has 
had an agreement in principle with Djibouti since December 
2003 for the land in question, and that \"Ambassador Selz 
(France\'s Ambassador in Djibouti) is pushing to conclude the 
matter.\"  Arrault went on to note \"confusion\" about the 
property as the precise area that the property encompasses 
\"keeps changing.\"  (Note: Both Ambassador and USLO Chief have 
seen a diplomatic note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of Djibouti which discusses an understanding between France 
and Djibouti on the matter of the land, but the evidence 
seems clear that there is no signed agreement between the 
sides.  No such formal agreement was signed during the visit 
in July of France\'s Defense Minister. In addition, Arrault\'s 
reference to changing land parameters would not indicate the 
existence of a binding formal agreement. End note.) 
 
5. (C) Ambassador spoke of the advantage that Arrault had as 
a newcomer in sharing a common language -- French -- with his 
military and political interlocutors.  She alluded to the 
clarity of intent that this would afford Arrault in his daily 
interactions with Djiboutians. Arrault responded that the 
sharing of French was not such an advantage in reality.  He 
said he found it difficult to understand some of the Afars 
and Issas with whom he spoke because of the different ways in 
which they used French.  In some instances, it was difficult 
to comprehend what exactly they were trying to communicate. 
In his view, the differences among Djiboutians ethnically 
were not bridged, unfortunately, by this common language of 
French. 
 
6. (U) BIO-DATA ON MICHEL ARRAULT (as provided):  General 
Michel Arrault was born November 10, 1952.  He entered the 
Air Force Academy and obtained his rating as a fighter pilot 
in March, 1976.  From 1976 to 1986, he flew the Mirage II and 
the Mirage F-1 and took command of an air defense fighter 
squadron in 1985.  During the Summer of 1986, he was 
positioned in the Office of the Inspector General of the Air 
Force in Paris, where he held the position of Deputy for 
Inspection, Fighter Operations.  In 1987, he was assigned to 
the 11th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying the Jaguar, and was 
Wing Commander in August, 1989.  After an Air War College 
course, he was assigned to Incirlik Air Force base Turkey, to 
assume the command of French forces attached to Turkey for 
\"Provide Comfort\" international operation.  He then took on 
the position of Deputy Commander of the Air Force Academy on 
June 1, 1992 and was responsible for all training programs 
for cadets.  In 1995, General Arrault was assigned as Base 
Commander at Luxeuil Air Force Base, operating the Mirage 
2000N in a nuclear deterrence role.  In 1997, he was 
positioned to the French Joint Headquarters, Paris, as 
capability manager in the nuclear forces department.  After a 
course with the \"Centre des Hautes Etudes Militaires\" in 
Paris, he was appointed as French Forces Commander in Chad. 
During the Summer of 2002, he was transferred to the 
Secretariat General for National Defense, Paris, as Deputy 
 
SIPDIS 
for International and Strategic Affairs.  He was appointed 
French Forces Commander in Djibouti. General Arrault has more 
than 3900 flying hours on several combat aircraft:  Alphajet, 
Mirage II, Mirage F1, Jaguar and Mirage 2000.  His awards and 
decorations include Officer in the Legion of Honor, Commander 
in the \"National Order of Merit,\" the \"Medaille de 
l\'Aeronautique and the Legion of Merit of the United States 
of America.  General Arrault is married with two children. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  General Arrault has limited English and is, 
therefore, more comfortable in French.  He has a less intense 
style than that of his predecessor General Pons, which may 
make for less intensity on the very issues of access to which 
Pons was so committed during his tenure here. End comment.

CJTF-HOA CHIEF INVITED 
 
 
 1. (U) During Ambassador\'s September 20 call on Dr. Attalla 
Hamad Bashir, Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental 
Authority on Development (IGAD), to present an invitation to 
him to attend a meeting of the Africa Partnership Forum 
(septel), Dr. Attalla indicated to her that he had extended 
to General Samuel Helland, Commander of the Combined Joint 
Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA), an invitation to speak 
at an IGAD workshop on terrorism.  The workshop, called the 
second IGAD Regional Workshop on Prevention and Combatting 
Terrorism, is scheduled to be held at the White Sands Hotel 
in Mombassa, Kenya on 18-21 October, according to Bashir.  He 
wanted the Ambassador to encourage the General\'s 
participation. 
 
2. (U) According to Dr. Bashir, the workshop is intended to 
bring together high-level members of IGAD member states from 
Defense, Internal Security, and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, as a way toward development of a coordinated 
regional strategy for dealing with terrorism in the region. 
He said he believed the CJTF-HOA has a perspective on this 
subject that might be useful in development of a strategy for 
achieving this.  As such, the invitation to General Helland 
was a request that he present a paper on \"The Challenges of 
the Task Force in Combatting Terrorism in the Horn of 
Africa.\" 
 
3. (U) The draft agenda for the conference, which Bashir 
shared with Ambassador, envisioned presentations by United 
Nations, European Union, and African Union experts on 
terrorism as well as statements by member states on the 
issue.  Also planned is a presentation by consultants Peter 
Marwa and Dr. Anneli Botha on the threat of terrorism in the 
region.  The conference would conclude with the presentation, 
discussion and adoption of a draft action plan for IGAD 
states. 
 
4. (SBU) Ambassador told Bashir that she agreed that the 
conference could be a very useful mechanism for close 
consultation and coordination among IGAD states on the issue 
of terrorism.  However, she was not sure of General Helland\'s 
schedule in the time frame noted, but would certainly 
encourage his participation or that of another representative 
of CJTF-HOA in his behalf.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. REASONS 1.4 (B) AND ( 
D). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  David Hawker, Dubai Ports International 
representative in Djibouti who manages Djibouti International 
Airport, confirmed to Ambassador the Government of Djibouti\'s 
interest in expanding the country\'s existing international 
airport at Ambouli.  Nothing firm is on the table, but issues 
of space will loom large in accommodating a second runway and 
in revamping or rebuilding the existing terminal.  Hawker 
sees U.S. use of the airport as incurring some additional 
cost for the airport.  At least USD 1.2 million will be 
required to purchase new fire engines to meet ICAO 
regulations as a result of the airport\'s accommodation of the 
U.S. C-5 \"Galaxy\" aircraft, according to Hawker. On the new 
seaport under construction at Doraleh, Hawker said 
clarification is needed from the U.S. Navy about the type and 
size of vessels it wishes to moor at the new port.  For now, 
Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), under its subsidiary 
Horizon, is not interested in accommodating the Navy\'s 
largest vessels, due to structural capacity limits of the 
Phase One oil terminal jetty.  Hawker also used the occasion 
of the Ambassador\'s call to again note that outstanding U.S. 
military aircraft parking fees ostensibly accrued to Camp 
Lemonier remain unsettled.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
The Future of the International Airport 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Ambassador asked Hawker where discussions were on the 
possibility of a new international airport, or expanded 
facility, for Djibouti.  Hawker said the Government of 
Djibouti wants to expand the current airport, but different 
elements that would be involved in planning -- potential 
private investors such as Djiboutian national Abdurrahman 
Boreh,  Defense which works with the U.S. and French military 
presence at the airport, the Foreign Ministry, and the 
Presidency --- are not coordinating with each other.  If 
there were coordination, Hawker opined, the current space 
allotted to the U.S. and France for military use would not 
have been provided. To build a new airport from scratch is an 
entirely different matter, he said.  \"It\'s dreadfully 
expensive.\"  Hawker continued that Dubai International has 
\"great interest\" in renovating or rebuilding the existing 
terminal at the airport and possibly constructing a second 
runway.   There were discussions already about expanding the 
terminal by 10 meters or so, he said, but was nixed as too 
costly for the space gained. It would be better to build a 
new terminal building.  That, with a second runway, would of 
course require more space than the airport currently has. The 
U.S. company Black and Veatch is looking at possibilities, 
but Hawker did not speculate on preliminary findings the 
company may have made. 
 
----------------------------- 
U.S. Naval Intent at Doraleh 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) In a discussion of progress, from site manager ENOC\'s 
perspective, in construction of the new Doraleh Phase One oil 
terminal facility, Hawker told Ambassador that it will be 
important to get clarification from the U.S. Navy about what 
would be the largest oil supply vessels it expected to bring 
into Doraleh to pick up and deliver fuel to its vessels 
offshore. Speaking frankly, he continued, he understood there 
was interest on the U.S. Embassy\'s side in possible carrier 
visits to port.  Hawker said his company is not particularly 
interested in servicing large vessels at its Phase I oil 
terminal container facility. He explained that the jetty at 
the new terminal could support a maximum of 80,000 dwt. A 
tanker, for example, is mostly underwater, creating less 
\"windage\", than an aircraft carrier, which is mostly above 
water and has extensions.  The jetty could not withstand the 
pressure of such a vessel unless piles were designed and 
manufactured differently.  However, once Phase II of port 
construction begins, which will include a container terminal, 
Hawker said, it would not be so difficult for a large carrier 
to come to shore.  However, he said he did not expect the 
container terminal to be operational until at least 2008. 
 
---------------------------------- 
The C-5 Increases Airport Expenses 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In a follow-on discussion of his office\'s interactions 
with Camp Lemonier, Hawker said the U.S. military\'s use of 
the airport\'s aircraft parking ramps necessitated some 
\"precision\" in guidelines as to what would trigger a parking 
charge to the U.S. military.  He said he would raise this 
soon with the Camp as there was a difference of perspective, 
for example, on what constituted \"overnight\" parking for U.S. 
aircraft.  It was important to collect these fees, Hawker 
continued, because of the added expense accruing to the 
airport of U.S. operation of C-5 aircraft in and out of 
Djibouti.  Hawker explained that under present ICAO 
guidelines, Djibouti qualifies for \"Category 7\" firefighting 
equipment.  Categories are defined in terms of the length and 
fuselage width of the aircraft operating out of the airport. 
These categories dictate the water capacity the engine is 
obliged to transport, among other requirements.  The entry 
and exit of U.S. C-5s (what Hawker termed \"Galaxy\" aircraft), 
increases that requirement to \"Category 9.\"  Thus new engines 
are needed.  He estimated the cost at USD 600,000 each for 
the two that Ambouli airport would require.  Hawker did not 
explicitly state that he wanted the U.S. to help foot the 
bill for the new engines.  However, he reiterated that the 
long-standing issue of sizable outstanding parking arrears 
attributed to Camp Lemonier has still not been resolved. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) Hawker, a UK national with links to the UAE and 
Djibouti, and with his vantage point grounded in the airport, 
is in a position to keep a firm finger on the commercial 
pulse of Djibouti.  He is generally well-informed and has not 
been reluctant to share his insight with the Embassy.  He 
continues to work the airport\'s specific issues of concern on 
the U.S. military side directly with Camp Lemonier, as 
Ambassador encourages.  End comment.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, EINV, SENV, DJ 
SUBJECT: DJIBOUTIAN-AMERICAN FISHING COMPANY LOOKING TO 
EXPAND EXPORT 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: The fishing sector in Djibouti has a new 
advocate in the form of Djibouti Maritime Management and 
Investment Company (DMMI), a joint venture owned in majority 
by Iranian-American investor Mehrdad Radseresht and 
Djiboutian businessman Youssouf Moussa Dawaleh. DMMI seeks to 
maximize the existing human and natural resources available 
to the fishing industry by providing the necessary services 
to local fishermen to get their catch to market, be it 
Djiboutian or export. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) DMMI was created in March 2004 after Youssouf Moussa 
Dawaleh, owner of the Pecherie de Boulaos (Boulaos Fish 
Market) and Parliamentarian from the Djibouti district, was 
tasked by President Ismael Omar Guelleh to turn the fishing 
port into a viable business entity.  It was originally built 
in 1997 by an Italian company with the aid of a French 
company\'s expertise.  Neither company used European 
standards, which in conjunction with the poor management of 
the fishing port rendered it unable to attract international 
buyers.  During Dawaleh\'s travels with President Guelleh, he 
met Mehrdad Radseresht, an Iranian-American investor based in 
the Middle East, and they decided to combine efforts to 
rehabilitate the fishing port.  DMMI is primarily owned by 
Radseresht at 55 percent, Dawaleh owns 40 percent and Port de 
Peche manager, Herve Prat, owns 5 percent.  DMMI was set up 
as a Free Zone company, allowing it duty free status, and 
given a 40-year concession for the lease of the Port de Peche. 
 
3. (U) DMMI\'s strategy is to maximize the existing human and 
natural resources in order to increase yearly production from 
500 tons to 2,000-3,000 tons per year.  Prat told Pol/Econ 
that the traditional fishing methods used by the fishermen in 
Djibouti are extremely well adapted to the environment and 
DMMI does not want to interfere with that method, merely 
enhance their capacity.  According to Prat, Djibouti has a 
fleet of 150 fishing boats, of which half are not operational 
or idle.  DMMI\'s plan is to rehabilitate the Port de Peche, 
provide an adequate place to anchor boats, provide free ice 
and duty free fuel and a cafeteria for the local fishermen. 
This will give the fishermen a comfortable and friendly place 
where they know they will have a market for their catch. 
Prat said that Port de Peche also has a fully equipped boat 
maintenance workshop that was funded by the United Nations 
Development Fund.  However, Prat said the project has 
remained locked and untouched because the Ministry of 
Agriculture has not yet named who will manage the workshop. 
 
4. (U) Well-equipped, DMMI\'s packing/processing operation 
sells fish to the Djiboutians and French ex-patriates and 
hopes to attract the American presence to their business as 
well.  Prat spoke frankly about the situation of fishing in 
Djibouti and presented realistic goals for the project. 
First, satisfy the local markets then move to the Arabian 
peninsula, where regulations are not as strict and air 
traffic connections already exist.  Prat said the African 
Development Bank is planning to fund the necessary upgrades 
to bring the port up to international standards, as well as 
build a lab for testing the fish.  According to Prat, a lab 
is not necessary for the moment and samples can easily be 
sent to France regularly for testing.  Prat did comment that 
the cost of production in Djibouti is forcing DMMI to use 
high margins to price their products. 
 
5. (U) The next phase of the plan to promote the already 
existing fishing industry in Djibouti is procuring a boat to 
provide access to the market for the fishermen in the 
northern region of the country.  The districts of Tadjourah 
and Obock have plentiful fishing waters and make up the 
majority of Djibouti\'s coastline.  However, both districts 
have extremely poor road infrastructure and a three to five 
hour drive to the capital.  By creating a boat service that 
can go to the fishermen, gather a daily catch and bring ice 
to the fishermen, this will allow greater access to the 
market for an underdeveloped region.  Prat specified that the 
boat would have to be designed to be fast, haul up to 6 tons 
each trip and be able to carry heavy loads of ice and living 
shellfish. 
 
6. (U) Prat asked Pol/Econ about the possibility of U.S. 
assistance for the project, in particular the funding and 
procurement of the boat.  Pol/Econ said she would look into 
the different programs available in the different agencies of 
the U.S. Government and would be happy to assist in making 
any business liaisons needed.  Prat also mentioned the idea 
of providing Camp Lemonier with locally caught fish. 
Pol/Econ explained the procedure of DOD procurement through 
the Defense Logistics Agency and offered to find contact 
information for the person who could arrange an inspection of 
the facilities in order to get DMMI certified as an 
authorized vendor.

1. (U) On September 22, Ambassador joined USAID 
Representative, POL/ECON and members of the Combined Joint 
Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) to inaugurate in 
Tadjoura and in Randa, two schools refurbished and funded by 
CJTF-HOA based at Camp Lemonier.  Ambassador cut the ribbon 
with the Director of each school and delivered brief remarks 
to the audiences that included the regional Commissar, a 
representative from the Ministry of Education, Mayors, school 
directors, staff, and students.  CJTF-HOA Chief of Staff, 
Colonel Craig S. Huddleston, also delivered brief statements 
at each event. 
 
2. (U) Both the Tadjoura Secondary School project and the 
Randa Primary School project had been managed by Sergeant 
Charles E. Dishman of CJTF-HOA Engineers, in coordination 
with Major Francois Ratinaud, Djibouti Country Desk Officer 
for CJTF-HOA.  At the Tadjoura school facility, 1,300 
students, 42 teachers and 5,000 family members benefited from 
a project that built and repaired the school\'s perimeter 
fence, painted the interior and exterior of the fence and 
repaired and replaced the roof on the principal\'s office. 
The local contractor was Enterprise Abdou Ali and the project 
was completed at a cost of USD 24,850. 
 
3. (U) At the Randa school facility, 315 students and 2,000 
family members benefited from a project for the safety of 
children.  CJTF-HOA built and repaired the critical retaining 
wall on the hillside adjacent to the school, repaired 
electrical wiring to classrooms enabling ceiling fans to 
operate, painted the interior and exterior of the school, 
repaired and replaced steps, and installed a roof on the 
principal\'s office.  The local contractor was Golf Enterprise 
and the project was completed at a cost of USD 78,623. 
 
4. (U) In remarks at both sites, the Ambassador expressed 
pleasure in joining her military colleagues in celebrating 
refurbishment of the schools.  She said projects such as 
these assist the Government of Djibouti achieve its aims and 
objectives to provide constructive education programs for 
Djibouti\'s youth.  America wants, as does the Government of 
Djibouti, to see those programs come to fruition in a 
physical environment that encourages learning and facilitates 
instruction, the Ambassador said. 
 
5. (U) The Ambassador continued that these school projects, 
like others the U.S. military has undertaken on behalf of the 
citizens of Djibouti, will enhance the bright future of the 
proud Tadjoura and Randa communities.  The work of the U.S. 
military, she added, is another example of the cooperation 
that is ongoing between the United States and Djibouti in 
education and in other fields. 
 
6. (U) The Ambassador concluded by noting the great pride the 
U.S. armed forces take in the projects they complete in 
Djibouti -- pride that is seen in the smiles on children\'s 
faces and in the enthusiasm of the teachers in the classroom. 
 She thanked her local hosts for welcoming her and her 
military colleagues and extended to both communities her best 
wishes for a productive and rewarding school year. 
 
7. (U) Comment: We cannot reiterate enough the value of 
simple but effective projects such as those CJTF-HOA has 
undertaken.  These quick impact undertakings are visibly 
appreciated by the people closest to them, especially in the 
rural areas.  We encourage their continuation as part of the 
good work Camp Lemonier is doing to make a difference in 
individual lives here in Djibouti. End comment.

upcoming elections. End Summary. 
 
IMPACT ON THE OPPOSITION 
------------------------ 
2. (U) In the January 2003 legislative elections, the UAD won 
36.9 percent of the vote.  This was the most significant gain 
for the opposition since the beginning of Djibouti\'s 
democratization in 1992. The main factor behind this 
percentage was the union of the opposition behind the 
charismatic leader, Dini, who was effectively the glue 
between the opposition parties.  The looming question is 
whether the next leader of UAD chosen will be Afar or Somali. 
 
 
3. (C) A secondary question that must be asked is: Will the 
opposition coalition hold together or splinter? In theory, 
whoever heads the UAD will be the opposition candidate for 
the presidential elections next spring. In reality, there are 
several paths for the opposition to take. Rumors about town 
suggest that opposition parties MRD (Movement for Democratic 
Renewal) and UDJ (Union for Democracy and Justice) might want 
to break the Afar hold on the lead of the opposition 
coalition. If an opposition member of Somali ethnic origin 
were to be placed as the presidential candidate opposite 
Guelleh, there is a potential for more Somali votes to go to 
the opposition. In this case, the Afar vote will only go to a 
Somali opposition candidate if he has a truly national vision 
and stays far from partisan politics. On the other hand, if 
the Afars maintain their hold on the opposition leadership, 
the ruling parties will depend on the Somali vote to tip the 
scales. In a third scenario, where the opposition presents 
two candidates - one Afar and one Somali, the opposition will 
most likely garner the majority of the Afar votes.  The 
Somali voters in this instance be split along tribal or clan 
lines, which could result in a decrease in the ruling party\'s 
margin. 
 
4. (C) Dini was the last big name in terms of opposition 
leaders for the Afars. The Afar community will feel a void 
where Dini once sat as there is not yet a credible 
personality that can argue the Afar interests as convincingly 
as did Dini with the ruling Issa majority.  There are other 
candidates but all lack the ease and eloquence of Dini. 
 
WHO\'S WHO OF DINI\'S HOPEFUL SUCCESSORS 
-------------------------------------- 
5. (C) At the moment, there are two camps vying for 
succession to Dini: those that claimed they fought political 
battles with him during his exile, and Dini\'s family and 
party cohorts. The most active are Kassim Ahmed Dini, Ahmed 
Dini\'s son, and Ahmed Youssouf, vice-president of ARD. In 
addition, Mohamed Daoud Chehem, president of PDD (Djiboutian 
Party for Democracy), Kassim Ali Dini, nephew of Ahmed Dini 
and member of ARD, Daher Ahmed Farah, president of MRD, and 
Ismael Guedi Hared, president of UDJ (Democratic Union for 
Justice) are vying for succession. 
 
6. (C) Kassim Ahmed Dini is known to possess great 
determination, however, he is not a likely candidate because 
of his youth and extreme tendencies in arguing for Afar 
interests.  Some feel that Kassim Ahmed is too focused on the 
Afar plight and ignores the other communities. Kassim Ahmed 
is also the editor-in-chief of La Realite, ARD\'s opposition 
journal. 
 
7. (C) Ahmed Youssouf, former Minister of Port in the late 
80\'s, is viewed as hot tempered and quick to react. He is the 
more likely candidate than Kassim Ahmed, but projections on 
how well he will do outside the ARD party cannot be made at 
this time. 
 
8. (C) Mohamed Daoud Chehem, is fairly balanced in terms of 
integrity and background. He has not displayed any tribal or 
clan favoritism, nor views that might qualify as extremist. 
Chehem served as Finance Minister from 1987 to 1991 before 
becoming an active leader in the armed rebellion by the FRUD 
party during the civil war in 1991-1993. Chehem announced 
last Monday his candidacy for President of Djibouti in the 
coming elections.  He said that his candidacy only speaks for 
his party and not the entire opposition coalition. Chehem 
stated the priorities of PDD\'s candidacy in a press release 
to Agence France Press as being \"the re-establishment of the 
authority of the State and the introduction of the rule of 
right, the democratization of the public life, the 
installation of an independent justice, the fight against 
corruption and nepotism and the restoration of public 
finances.\" 
 
9. (C) Daher Ahmed Farah is well-known in the Djiboutian 
political scene.  Farah was arrested several times in 2003 
for comments made against government officials in his party\'s 
journal (MRD), La Liberte.  Former military turned 
journalist, Farah has no experience in public affairs.  MRD 
is comprised mainly of Issa sub-clan Fourlaba ethnic 
Djiboutians.  The Fourlaba do not have a wide spread base 
throughout Djibouti, so a Fourlaba candidate may not garner 
many votes outside the sub-clan. 
 
10. (C) Ismael Guedi Hared, Issa sub-clan Saad Moussa, was 
known to be very generous towards his sub-clan, but very 
partisan against the other communities during his tenure in 
public office. If chosen as opposition candidate, only his 
sub-clan will be 100 percent supportive. 
 
11. (C) Comment: The key point in a discussion of the impact 
of Dini\'s death on Djiboutian politics is whether the 
opposition coalition will remain intact or the four parties 
go their own direction. The motivation behind PDD President 
Chehem\'s declaration of candidacy is a linchpin to 
deciphering this particular mystery.  If Chehem\'s declaration 
was done in collaboration with and the consent of the other 
three opposition parties, we might safely project that the 
opposition will present an Afar candidate and a Somali 
candidate.  Chehem\'s press release to AFP indicated that, in 
the event of a second round tie-breaking vote he would defer 
to the opposition candidate who gained the most votes.  This 
could indicate that the other parties were well aware of this 
action.  If the opposite holds, this could indicate that PDD 
is breaking from the coalition but leaving a loophole in case 
of success.

For reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Combating poverty, improving the nation\'s 
health and education infrastructures and services and 
promoting economic development are top priorities for the 
Government of Djibouti.  Embassy Djibouti and CJTF-HOA are 
working in tandem to assist in these areas.  Economic 
ventures undertaken within the country must be seen within 
the context of the desire of the President of Djibouti to 
boost Djibouti\'s economy.  Moreover, a major joint-venture 
port construction project with Emirates National Oil Company 
(ENOC)  is being touted as an integral part of Djibouti\'s 
economic future.  When the port comes on line in 2005, it 
will also support oil storage objectives of the U.S. Navy in 
the region under a contract with Defense Energy Support 
Center (DESC). 
 
2. (C) Djibouti\'s attitude toward the U.S. remains favorably 
disposed.  The U.S. military is in the process of negotiating 
extension of its lease and access at Camp Lemonier and 
President Guelleh has made known his desire to see the U.S. 
play a positive role in achieving security and stability in 
the Horn of Africa region.  He is urging international 
community support of the Somali reconciliation process but 
also agreed recently to host a Somaliland interests, office 
in Djibouti.  Foreign affairs agencies in Washington are 
re-examining core U.S. strategy for engagement in Somalia and 
Somaliland, but remain committed at this point to a  unified 
Somalia.  U.S.-Djibouti military and anti-terrorism 
cooperation remain strong and Djibouti continues to support 
our ongoing efforts at terrorist interdiction in the region. 
Djibouti is less than satisfied, however, with the pace of 
delivery of equipment promised or pledged under the Foreign 
Military Financing (FMF) program and has voiced its concerns 
with the Ambassador, to which we have been responsive. 
 
3. (C) On issues outside the region, President Guelleh has 
been quite vocal in expressing a deep disappointment with the 
lack of progress in ending the conflict between Israelis and 
Palestinians.  End summary. 
 
Focus on Domestic Development Priorities 
---------------------------------------- 
4. (C) The top domestic priorities for the Government of 
Djibouti are combating poverty, improving the nation\'s health 
and education infrastructures and services , and promoting 
economic development.  Through USAID, the U.S. is assisting 
the Government of Djibouti implement a nation-wide education 
reform program at funding of USD 14 million over three years. 
  We are also assisting the Government of Djibouti to 
increase, at a funding level of USD 12 million over three 
years, equitable access to health care particularly of the 
poor , and  the provision of quality and efficient health 
care to reduce infant, child and maternal mortality.  We are 
joined in these efforts by the numerous small school and 
clinic rehabilitation and refurbishment projects undertaken 
successfully by the Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa 
(CJTF-HOA) at Camp Lemonier. 
 
5. (C) The U.S. is  also assisting Djibouti increase 
opportunities for international sale of its livestock and is 
funding construction of a holding pen for livestock destined 
for the Arabian Peninsula to include veterinary inspection 
and export certification.  Camp Lemonier has expressed 
concerns about the proximity of the pen to the Camp and is 
seeking clarification  from USAID of the facility\'s 
environmental implications. 
 
6. (C) President Guelleh is the driving force behind many 
economic ventures that the Djiboutian government hopes will 
boost the nation\'s economy.  He is most proud of the port of 
Doraleh, and the economic potential he sees in this 
joint-venture construction project with Emirates National Oil 
Company (ENOC).  Doraleh is being touted as an integral part 
of Djibouti\'s economic future.  Once completed, it will have 
a Free Zone, an oil storage terminal facility, a container 
terminal, and a bulk terminal.  The oil terminal facility 
will be the first to come on line, with a target completion 
date of May, 2005.  Oil companies operating in Djibouti have 
already received notice of the requirement that they relocate 
their operations to Doraleh where they will be obliged to 
lease oil storage tanks from ENOC. Four of the oil storage 
tanks have been reserved for exclusive use of the U.S. Navy 
under an open-tender Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) 
contract with ENOC. 
 
7. (C) Djibouti is anxious to qualify in Fiscal Year 2005 for 
additional economic development assistance under the 
Millennium Challenge Act of 2003.  The Act authorizes the 
provision of economic assistance to countries that enter into 
compacts with the U.S. to support internal policies and 
programs that advance the prospects of lasting economic 
growth and poverty reduction.  Eligibility will depend on 
Djibouti\'s ability to demonstrate its commitment to just and 
democratic governance, economic freedom and investment in its 
people.  Djibouti still has much work to do in these areas, 
but we are cooperating with the Millennium Challenge 
Corporation (MCC) and the Government of Djibouti to provide 
the data needed for an earnest assessment. 
 
Looking at the Horn of Africa Region and a U.S. Role 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8. (C) President Guelleh expects a positive United States 
role in the achievement of security and stability in the Horn 
of Africa region and in the resolution of regional conflicts. 
 In his speech before the General Assembly of the United 
Nations on September 22, he highlighted the need for 
international support and assistance for regional 
peacekeeping efforts, as well as placing an emphasis on 
solving the problem of terrorism by getting at its root 
rather than reacting immediately with military force. In that 
address, he also detailed the problem of arms trafficking in 
Africa and the need to halt the diversion of Africa\'s 
resources away from its critical needs. 
 
9. (C) President Guelleh is also urging the international 
community to provide assistance and support to the Somali 
reconciliation process.  Djibouti, like the U.S, wishes to 
see a unified Somalia.  Nevertheless, Guelleh agreed recently 
to host a Somaliland interests, office in Djibouti and 
Somaliland continues to press the U.S. and other nations for 
political recognition.  U.S. foreign affairs agencies have 
begun a process of re-examining core U.S. strategy for 
counter-terrorism, political and economic engagement in 
Somalia and Somaliland, and our long-term policy with respect 
to both.  U.S. Embassy Nairobi recently conducted a security 
assessment of Somaliland by sending three of its officers, 
including the Regional Security Officer (RSO) to Hargeisa. 
 
Strong  U.S.- Djibouti Military 
and Anti-terrorism Cooperation 
------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) The attitude of the Government of Djibouti and the 
general population continues to be favorably disposed towards 
the United States.  U.S.- Djibouti military and 
anti-terrorism cooperation remain strong and Djibouti is 
supporting our ongoing efforts at terrorist interdiction. 
Training programs under the East Africa Counter-terrorism 
initiative (EACTI) have taken place with law enforcement, 
military, and intelligence personnel. Djibouti is less than 
satisfied, however, with the pace of delivery of equipment 
promised or pledged under FMF.  General Fathi, Commander of 
the Djiboutian Armed Forces, has raised this issue with 
Ambassador and with USLO Chief. We have received 
clarification from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency 
(DSCA) on the FMF process, and on delivery and have conveyed 
this information to General Fathi. General Fathi has also 
expressed to Ambassador, formally, his desire to see better 
coordination between the U.S. and Djibouti on use of local 
military firing ranges.  CJTF-HOA Commander Helland has 
addressed this issue with General Fathi and is sending a 
follow-up letter. 
 
11. (C) The U.S., under Department of Defense auspices, began 
on September 16 negotiations with Djibouti on renewal of the 
U.S. military\'s lease agreement for Camp Lemonier. Lead U.S. 
negotiator Theresa Whelan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Africa, has already provided Ambassador Olhaye in 
Washington with a draft agreement. 
 
Concerns About the Middle East 
------------------------------ 
 
12. (C) President Guelleh has not been very vocal publicly in 
either supporting or condemning the U.S.-led war in 
Afghanistan or in Iraq, perhaps out of deference to his 
country\'s hosting of the U.S. military.  In a conversation 
with the Ambassador in April of this year, Guelleh cautioned 
that U.S. efforts to \"shut down\" Moqtada al-Sadr were having 
the opposite effect.  Instead of earning the Shiite leader 
detractors, it was making him more popular.  (see reftel) 
 
13. (C) By contrast, Guelleh has been consistently vocal 
about his deep disappointment with a lack of progress in 
ending the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. 
Guelleh faults Israel for the impasse.  In his recent speech 
before the United Nations, he expressed the view that the 
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is part of a three and a 
half decades-long process of blatant confiscation of 
Palestinian lands, farmlands and water resources.  He 
criticized Israel\'s separation wall, which he stated makes an 
already explosive situation worse and creates irreversible 
facts on the ground.  Israel\'s actions, in Guelleh,s view, 
have made a mockery of the U.S. \"Road Map\" and rendered it 
worthless.  In this same speech, he described the 
Palestinians as \"struck with an indefinite deprivation, a 
sense of hopelessness and statelessness\" and criticized the 
United Nations for its inability to constrain Israel.

SUBJECT: VISIT TO GABODE PRISON 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Summary: Pol/Econ, USLO NCO, and Pol Asst visited 
Djibouti\'s civil prison, Gabode, on September 23rd.  Followed 
by a tour of the facilities, Pol/Econ discussed the 
conditions with the Director of the Prison, Mohamed Ismail. 
The following is reaction to the conditions and a brief 
overview of the conversation with Ismail. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The conditions at Gabode Prison were considerably 
better than Embassy staff expected to see based on the 
general impression from word on the street.  That said, one 
can imagine that conditions were spruced up a bit in the two 
weeks between the Embassy\'s formal request to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and our actual visit.  The prison grounds are 
all dirt and were fairly clean compared to some of the 
streets throughout Djibouti City.  Buildings that inmates 
occupy have cement flooring, which was usually covered in 
dirt or mud.  All areas have ceiling fans to cool them, 
except the infirmary which has the only air conditioner in 
the prison, but it has been broken for several months. The 
kitchen facilities are primitive and do not seem adequate for 
feeding 300 to 500 persons.  Animals that are slaughtered in 
order to feed the prisoners wander freely around the prison 
compound.  Trash is burned in the open, as is customary for 
most residents of Djibouti.  Buildings are extremely 
dilapidated.  There are four new buildings constructed by the 
Government of Djibouti that house male inmates doing shorter 
sentences.  One of the four has a problem with its electrical 
wiring and therefore stands empty while the prison 
administrators wait for someone who can fix it. The main 
generator for the prison is broken, funds are not available 
in the prison budget to fix it. 
 
3. (C) The women\'s facility is completely separated from the 
minors\' and men\'s sections.  During the visit there were 11 
women in the general area and one in criminal confinement. 
Ismail said that she had to be housed away from the other 
women or she would likely injure or kill them.  In the event 
of a woman having a child in prison, mother and child are 
kept together.  The conditions in the women\'s facility are 
described as luxurious compared to other prison facilities. 
The women have no beds and sleep on blankets piled on the 
cement floor.  There is a courtyard, a general sleeping 
quarters, a toilet and shower area immediately adjacent to 
the sleeping quarters and then the criminal confinement area, 
which has all of the above areas as well.  The toilet 
consists merely of two holes in the ground, where the 
sanitation piping is located and a bucket of clean water to 
wash with. 
 
4. (C) The infirmary appeared as dirty as other areas of the 
prison.  Upon entering the infirmary compound, we saw as many 
as eight sheep exit the infirmary compound when the door was 
unlocked.  There are beds in the infirmary, but the 
mattresses and bedding are extremely old and not clean.  The 
shower and toilet facilities are well separated from the 
sleeping quarters but are essentially the same as described 
in the women\'s area.  There were several people crowding 
around the courtyard and offices of the doctor.  We were told 
that there a doctor is always on duty, as well as one nurse. 
Medicine is provided by the Ministry of Health.  Donations 
from the Red Crescent were used in the past to supply the 
infirmary but that is no longer the case.  The one air 
conditioner in the prison is in the supply room of the 
infirmary.  It has been broken for several months.  Medicines 
are stored at room temperature - which in Djibouti is roughly 
the same as the outside air, ranging from 85 degrees 
Fahrenheit in the winter months to 130 degrees Fahrenheit in 
the summer months.  When asked if the supply of medicine was 
sufficient to treat the number of prisoners resident at 
Gabode in case of an emergency, the doctor said no, but 
conditioned that supplies were regularly replenished if they 
ran out. 
 
5. (C) The kitchen is roughly in the same state.  Food is 
brought in three times a day in order to prepare meals, 
according to Ismail.  The visit was around the time that the 
mid-day meal was being prepared. The meat was being butchered 
in unsanitary conditions.  The general food preparation area 
was as unhygenic as any other in the prison. Flies and 
insects swarmed the meat as it was being cut.  The prison 
employs one cook who is aided by the prisoners.  On a daily 
basis the prison prepares 70 kilograms of food per day.  The 
annual food budget is 13 million Djiboutian Francs (roughly 
730,000 USD).  Ismail said if the prisoner population remains 
at 350 the budget may stretch far enough when you factor out 
those that are being fed by their family.  He said frequently 
there is a deficit by September.  Many prisoners choose to 
have family bring them food, some even share with the other 
prisoners.  Ismail said that many of the families of patients 
in the infirmary fully supply the food for their kin.  He 
said the prison relies on a certain number to be fed by their 
family so that the rations provided by the prison can go far 
enough.  Ismail commented that there is much strain placed on 
the prison system by illegal foreigners.  He continued that 
there is the view in Djibouti that they are not Djiboutian, 
why should it be necessary to feed and house them and not 
send them home?  But, he said, it is not right according to 
human rights - we must take care of anyone that is arrested 
in Djibouti.  This places a great burden on the system. 
 
6. (C) The prison seems to be capped at a budgetary and 
physical capacity to care for 350 persons.  The annual budget 
does not adequately cover the expenses of the prison in terms 
of food, maintenance and administrative costs.  The physical 
capacity is limited by buildings that aren\'t usable, but the 
prisoners\' residence quarters seem crowded despite that. 
Ismail said that the prison depends on the twice annual 
amnesties - at Independence Day and Ramadan - to reduce the 
prisoner population.  This year\'s independence day amnesty 
released 200 prisoners.  Ismail said those that are released 
usually get arrested again soon after.  The budget used to be 
25 million DF annually but was cut to 13 million DF recently. 
 The budget does not include salaries of the 16 person 
administrative staff, which is paid by the government, nor 
for any repairs or maintenance.  Currently, there are 144 
prisoners waiting for judgment out of the 350 total.  14 
persons are in on \"criminal\" charges, one of which is serving 
a life sentence.  According to Ismail, the law states that a 
Djiboutian must be tried within four months of arrest for 
minor infractions and foreigners within six months. 
Prisoners arrested on more severe criminal charges must be 
tried within two years of arrest.  Ismail said the longest 
anyone has stayed without judgment is eight years - he did 
not specify the crime. 
 
7. (C) The prison recently acquired two vehicles for daily 
transportation needs, though Ismail stressed that the prison 
needs its own ambulance.  He commented that when a prisoner 
got sick in the past it was necessary to call the hospital 
and wait until the ambulance could get to them, sometimes 
several hours later.  With the two vehicles it now has, 
prison officials can carry the prisoner to the hospital, but 
they must compete with the traffic like any other car. 
 
8. (C) Ismail pressed the notion that the most important 
improvement needed for the prison was a separate medical 
treatment facility at the entrance of the prison to screen 
prisoners prior to placement with the rest of the prison 
population.  He said that it is necessary to examine and 
diagnose prisoners for diseases like tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS 
and pneumonia to avoid wide spread contagion.  Ismail was 
extremely concerned that the priorities were not in the right 
place.  He commented \"it is much better to have run down 
buildings with healthy people inside than brand new 
facilities with people spreading sickness.\"

SUBJECT: CONVERSATION WITH OPPOSITION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 1250 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Marguerita D. Ragsdale. 
For reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: In a statement to the press 30 August 2004, 
Mohamed Daoud Chehem, president of opposition Djiboutian 
Party for Development (PDD), declared his candidacy for the 
presidential race to take place in April/May 2005.  Chehem 
visited Ambassador Ragsdale 29 September as a courtesy call 
to explain his position.  Chehem\'s party is aligned with 
three other opposition parties in the Union for Democratic 
Alternance coalition.  Chehem explained that his candidacy 
was for his party alone and there are likely to be candidates 
from the other parties. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Mohamed Daoud Chehem, President of opposition 
political party PDD, paid a call September 28 on Ambassador 
Ragsdale to clarify the intent behind his 30 August 
announcement of his candidacy for president of Djibouti. 
Pol/Econ (notetaker) and Pol Assistant sat in on the meeting. 
 Chehem stated at the outset that he would like to clarify 
what his announcement means for the opposition coalition.  He 
continued that the opposition has the intent of presenting 
more than one candidate for next year\'s presidential race in 
order to reduce the chance of Ismail Omar Guelleh being 
re-elected.  Chehem explained that in Djibouti, people follow 
their tribe in voting.  If only one candidate is presented by 
the opposition there is no chance to use tribal alignments to 
the opposition\'s advantage.  Chehem explained that his 
announcement only concerned his own party and the other 
parties in the coalition would likely present their own 
candidates.  He assured Ambassador that he would defer to the 
opposition candidate with the most votes for the second round 
of voting. 
 
3. (C) In Djibouti\'s election procedures, if no candidate 
receives more than 50 percent of the vote, a run-off election 
must take place.  Chehem stated that by splitting the 
opposition in the first round, the possibility existed of 
pulling more Somali votes from Guelleh.  After the first 
round, the opposition would unite again against Guelleh. 
 
4. (C) Chehem then turned the topic of conversation to his 
thoughts on the state of governance in Djibouti.  In plain 
words, Chehem said, there is no state in Djibouti. Rather, 
the state consists of one man.  He continued that the 
disparity between rich and poor in Djibouti grows.  Chehem 
said that Guelleh and he \"do not have the same concept of 
serving the state.\"  On Guelleh\'s rule, he offered the view 
that there is too much corruption and total impunity.  There 
are laws on the books, but no one enforces them.  \"When 
Hassan Gouled was in power, Chehem added, there was at least 
a pretense of governance.\" 
 
5. (C) In Chehem\'s opinion, lack of money is not a problem in 
Djibouti.  He repeatedly said: \"we have the money, we have 
the resources, they are mismanaged, they go into the pockets 
of different people.\"  For Chehem, it is  the government that 
has created poverty in Djibouti.  Resources have been 
increased, but services decreased.  Chehem was adamant that 
many problems could be improved by better managing the 
state\'s income.  He continued that there needs to be more 
motivation for people to do better and severity and sanctions 
when people do wrong.  Chehem commented that there formerly 
existed a service to maintain and clean the city, in the 
capital and in the districts.  He continued that the 
resources to employ people for that service are still there 
but are not being used or funds for the service are being 
diverted.  Chehem stated that official fiscal assets for the 
state in the first six months of this year was 13.5 billion 
DF (approx. 76 million USD), and double that for the full 
year\'s budget.  This figure does not include aid funding from 
the French or the U.S., which adds another 40 billion DF 
(approx. 226 million USD), according to Chehem. (Note: Chehem 
did not detail what the annual output for payment of state 
obligations was for FY 2004. Without that balance post cannot 
comment on Chehem\'s claim of money mismanagement. End Note.) 
 
6. (C) When asked about economic projects that Guelleh has 
introduced, Chehem was extremely negative.  He stated that 
the project at Port of Doraleh is a private project that does 
not benefit the people.  Rather, its profits go to three 
people: businessman Abdourahman Boreh, President Guelleh and 
the state of Dubai.  He continued that 70 percent of the 
workers are foreigners and that Djiboutians are not happy 
with that.  Chehem did say that it is necessary to expand the 
port, but that this particular venture was a monopoly. 
 
7. (C) In response to Ambassador\'s question regarding whether 
Chehem perceived a desire by Djibouti to look northwards 
toward the Arab world or southwards toward Africa, Chehem 
stated \"We are an African country and we consider ourselves 
African.\"  He explained that Djibouti has stronger ties with 
Ethiopia and Somalia.  Somalia joined the Arab League to put 
more pressure on France to give Djibouti independence, and 
that once gained, Djibouti felt compelled to also join.  He 
commented that there formerly was business with Rwanda, 
Uganda and Zaire (Democratic Republic of Congo) at the port. 
Djibouti is ready to do resume such business, but there is no 
justice.  Chehem agreed that there was not a high volume of 
business from Africa at present, but in order to promote it, 
greater protections for the investors in the judicial system 
would be needed. 
 
8. (C) BIO: Chehem is an Afar from the northern region of 
Djibouti.  He was Director of the Cabinet for the Prime 
Minister in 1978 and served three years as Finance Minister. 
Chehem was a member of the armed faction of FRUD, the 
opposition party that rebelled in the early 1990\'s resulting 
in ten years of civil war. Chehem was jailed in 1990 for his 
involvement in FRUD. After his release he went to Ethiopia, 
but was extradited back to Djibouti in 1998. 
 
9. (C) COMMENT: Common opinion of Chehem in Djibouti is that 
he is fairly even minded and not predisposed to favor his 
clan over any other.  Reportedly, during his time as Finance 
minister, he tried to govern by the book and to accomplish 
change.  This is also the reported reason as to why he was 
removed from that position.  Chehem\'s demeanor is very 
congenial but he lacks the charisma of a leader.  His ideas 
seem honestly conveyed and he appears genuinely to desire 
change, but he lacks an explanation on how he would 
accomplish any of his goals.  Post cannot yet comment on the 
extent of support for Chehem in the Djiboutian community. 
END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI PASSES NEW LEGISLATION ON CITIZENSHIP 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: On 26 September the Permanent Commission of 
the Djiboutian National Assembly adopted a new law regarding 
qualifications for Djiboutian citizenship.  The new law is 
more liberal than the current requirements and will give 
greater rights to pass on citizenship to Djiboutian women. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) Currently, the law states that a person must show 
proof of both the mother and father having citizenship in 
order to be eligible for Djiboutian nationality.  The 
legislation adopted on 26 September will change the 
requirement to show proof of either the mother or the 
father\'s Djiboutian citizenship.  Due to the nature of the 
bookkeeping at the Population Services and the historically 
nomadic nature of the Djiboutian population, many cases 
depend on the applicant being \"well-known\" by the case 
workers, or the district commissioners in the instance of 
those outside Djibouti city. 
 
3. (U) Only the Service de Population (Population Service) 
within the Ministry of Interior has the responsibility and 
authority to issue national identity cards.  The Service de 
Population has one office in the capital city.  However, 
District Commissioners are also given authority to process 
cases and submit them to the main bureau in the capital. 
This, and the lack of funds, personnel and training, has led 
to there being a reported back-log of applications that 
number nearly 6,000. 
 
4. (U) Identity cards cost the applicant 2,000 DF (roughly 11 
USD) for the initial application. Replacements are much more 
expensive at 10,000 DF (56 USD).  The cost of even the 
initial application is prohibitive for the average Djiboutian 
family, whose average GDP per capita is measured at only 
1,200 USD annually. (Note: This figure does not take into 
account the over 50 percent unemployment rate. End Note.) 
Many families choose to use their money to purchase food for 
their children rather than apply for a national ID. 
 
5. (U) The lack of a National Identity Card can make a 
Djiboutian\'s life very difficult.  There are numerous tasks 
that one cannot accomplish without an identity card. 
Registering for school, getting a job, and collecting 
benefits are among many.  Because many children do not have 
ID cards and cannot go to school without one, the Service de 
Population is starting to expedite processing applications in 
batches by year of birth - starting with the most recent 
decade.  Occasional round-ups of illegal aliens can also be 
one situation where it is dangerous not to have a national 
identity card. 
 
6. (U) Said Aboubaker Bosoma, Director of the Service de 
Population said in a conversation with PolOff on 18 August 
that the present system, though simple, does not work well 
and the service does have a large back-log.  Bosoma said 
there is great need for their archives and processing system 
to be computerized in order to accelerate work.  He also 
commented that the new law, which at the time had not been 
passed, would facilitate working through the caseload by 
making it easier to attain citizenship.

SUBJECT: DEAF SCHOOL OPENS AT GIRLS\' ORPHANAGE 
 
1. (U) Summary: The Association for the Protection of Mother 
and Child opened 15 September a school for deaf children on 
the grounds of the Girls\' Orphanage.  Pol/Econ and Pol 
Assistant visited the school and toured the orphanage on 30 
September.  At the moment the center runs three classes daily 
for deaf children.  The Association hopes to have a total of 
six classes daily available in the future. Also available to 
the girls are study programs in vocational studies, Arabic 
language, and French language study programs. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) In Djibouti, as is the case in many parts of the 
world, having a deaf child is seen as a shame to the family. 
The subject is not discussed and the child is not engaged in 
the society as a whole.  For this reason, it is surprising to 
hear of a school for the deaf opening its doors to the 
public.  Placed within the grounds of the Girls\' Orphanage, 
the Association for the Protection of Mother and Child has 
opened three classes for deaf children, and their parents, in 
Djibouti City.  The director of the center, Yonis Awad Djama, 
said having three classes is merely a beginning and the 
center hopes to expand to six classes once more funds are 
available.  Djama said in preparation for opening, the center 
took a survey in the neighborhood of Balbala, one of the most 
populous neighborhoods, to find out a general number of those 
interested in such a center.  The survey showed, in Balbala 
alone, there were 300 deaf children.  Djama said there are 
probably many more throughout the capital city and in the 
districts. 
 
3. (U) Djama stated the belief of the center that all 
children should be cared for and a child\'s deafness should 
not mean the end of their world.  The school employs teachers 
from a similar association based in Somaliland.  The teachers 
are trained in Somaliland and use Kenyan sign language 
because it is closest culturally and will facilitate life in 
the region more than a European or American sign language. 
Djama said this project is being funded by the association 
itself to start, but it will have to request aid from other 
donors if there is an intent to maintain or expand classes. 
Classes are offered free of all charges to the parents of 
deaf children making it possible for families who have 
difficulty sending healthy children to school to consider 
their deaf child for schooling.  The average age in the deaf 
classes is six.  For the moment, the center is only taking 
students up to age 12.  Djama said there are plans to expand 
the age range. 
 
4. (U) The center tries to provide transportation to and from 
the child\'s house on a daily basis for both the parent and 
child.  They are limited by their resources which consist of 
a large bus donated by the French military.  It is difficult 
to get parts for the model of bus in Djibouti so it takes 
much longer to repair when it breaks. 
 
5. (U) The girls orphanage, and the Association as a whole, 
is one of the most active organizations in Djibouti City. 
The orphanage has reformed the way it operates in the past 
three years by placing an emphasis on self-sufficiency and 
giving the girls new opportunities to learn.  As well as the 
deaf school, the Association teaches classes in the Arab 
school program for girls unable to succeed in the French 
curriculum at Djibouti public schools.  The center tries to 
make all the girls feel as if they have a skill that they can 
do well.  In this regard, if the girls do not succeed in the 
Arabic curriculum, they are given the option of pottery or 
sewing.  All the girls in the orphanage attend these classes, 
which as Djama said, allows the girls to see that some people 
are stronger in certain subjects where others are not.  This, 
he continued, gives them a sense of pride instead of focusing 
on their lack of success in another subject. 
 
6. (U) The orphanage\'s sewing, pottery, and baking classes 
are part of workshops that the orphanage uses to support 
itself.  Girls that participate in the workshops earn a 
portion of the proceeds from the sale of their items - to 
encourage the idea that hard work is rewarded.  The center\'s 
bakery produces first for their own use and then sells the 
extra to the general public.  It is working on expanding the 
bakery to include more than just bread.  The desire is to be 
able to bake and sell the full range of baked goods, 
including sweet breads and pastries.  Djama also tries to 
involve the girls in management of the center. 
 
7. (U) The orphanage is also in the process to establishing 
and expanding its library.  With the aid of a grant from the 
Chinese, the orphanage now has computers in the library for 
the girls and a full computer center for training both 
orphanage residents and outside clients.  Djama said one 
person is employed to teach computer skills to the girls and 
as a cooperation with the Government, earns fees for classes 
given to the Service National Adaptee (Adapted National 
Service - a program within the Djiboutian army that combines 
job skill training and military service for young people). 
Djama wants to add an Internet connection to the library and 
to expand computer classes eventually.  He also said the lack 
of books and other learning materials is slow to be filled, 
but books in English are expected from the Embassy\'s Public 
Diplomacy office. 
 
8. (U) Djama encourages the idea of cooperation over charity. 
 In response to Pol/Econ\'s question regarding the level of 
volunteers from the French, American or Djiboutian community, 
he said the center prefers that if a person comes to teach 
the girls something, the center provides them a service in 
return.  For example, many French military wives help the 
girls with their lessons. In return, the girls teach the 
wives sewing or pottery.  Djama said bringing in people from 
other cultures for exchanges like this allows the girls to 
see that there is more to the world than just Djibouti.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI AND SAFE SKIES FOR AFRICA REVIEW 
 
REF: SECSTATE 203125 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: As Djibouti does not yet have a program 
under Safe Skies for Africa, Post endeavors to describe 
what the civil aviation officials on the ground hope a 
SSFA program could provide.  Djibouti\'s airport is not 
up to international standards as written by the ICAO, 
however, according to Airport Director, David Hawker, 
it is not far from standards.  The most critical point 
that needs to be addressed in order to be compliant is 
the existence of national legislation regarding airport 
standards.  Djibouti\'s department of Civil Aviation 
reportedly has a draft in the works.  However, Hawker 
hopes that the Government can be persuaded to adopt the 
ICAO legislation as its own rather than attempting to 
draft a new law from scratch. END SUMMARY. 
 
DJIBOUTI\'S RESOURCES ON THE GROUND 
---------------------------------- 
2. (U) Ambouli International Airport is a single runway 
airport located just outside the capital city of 
Djibouti.  The airport is flanked by the French Air 
Force Base, the American military base home to the 
Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa, and the Gulf 
of Tadjourah.  The airport presently can land, and does 
land, planes as large as the C-5 Galaxy.  Though the 
airport can land planes suitable for mass-cargo shipping, 
its air traffic is currently limited to mostly passenger 
flights. 
 
3. (U) Djibouti\'s air connections currently include 
weekly flights from Paris on Daallo Airlines, Air France 
and Ethiopian Airlines; flights to Addis Ababa three 
times weekly on Ethiopian Airlines; flights three times 
weekly to Dubai on both Djibouti Airlines and Daallo 
Airlines; twice weekly connections to Nairobi on Kenyan 
Airways; and British Airways services that connect to 
Asmara and Nairobi.  Djibouti Airlines also connects 
regionally to Hargeisa and Dire Dawa. Its capacity to 
handle cargo and freight shipping is currently minimal. 
 
4. (U) Security screening equipment is limited to two 
out of date belt-fed x-ray machines and two walk 
through metal detectors to scan baggage and personal 
goods.  Security lighting is well within ICAO regulated 
codes, thanks to a grant project by the French military. 
Both the American and French military have improved the 
exterior fencing around portions of the airport, but 
several hundred kilometers more is still needed. 
Fire-fighting equipment consists of one engine that can 
no longer make the length of the runway in two minutes, 
as required by safety regulations.  According to Hawker, 
there is no significant change since the last FAA 
evaluation of the airport, improvements are already 
underway. 
 
5. (SBU) Security for the airport is provided by a 
combination of National Police and Gendarme personnel. 
This arrangement has proven to be less than efficient. 
Overlapping and redundant responsibilities among the 
security services, coupled with the lack of clear 
legislation and detailed planning for airport security, 
engenders confusion and creates serious vulnerabilities. 
It is unclear as to which organization has the 
responsibility and jurisdiction to provide emergency 
response to critical situations.  In addition, while 
there is a controlled-access badge system in place, 
there is a significant abuse of privilege and a resultant 
lackadaisical attitude on behalf of the security 
personnel.  This deficiency presents a situation in 
which sensitive areas of the airport are loosely 
controlled and are easily penetrated by unauthorized 
personnel either posing as important officials or 
slipping past unwary sentries. 
 
6. (U) The airport land and infrastructure is owned 
by the Government of Djibouti but managed by Dubai 
Ports International.  The total budget of the airport 
is provided by funds generated by incoming and 
outgoing passenger and cargo traffic.  Currently, 
this traffic is barely enough to maintain existing 
functions.  Though there has been an increase in 
passenger traffic due to economic development projects, 
it is not yet enough to make the airport profitable. 
 
WHAT DJIBOUTI LACKS 
------------------- 
7. (U) Djibouti currently does not meet international 
regulations for fire fighting equipment.  Though it 
can land a plane as large as a C-5 Galaxy, it does 
not have the equipment that would bring it up to 
category nine fire-fighting standards.  The one engine 
the airport has is outdated and cannot get from one 
end of the runway to the other in under two minutes, 
as required by ICAO regulations. 
 
8. (U) Djibouti\'s airport is not certified, and cannot 
become certified until it has national legislation to 
comply with.  Hawker hopes that the Djiboutian Civil 
Aviation Authority and the Government of Djibouti will 
adopt the ICAO standards as its own.  Hawker said that 
in any case, the airport is working towards the ICAO 
standards regardless of how the legislation issue goes. 
 
9. (U) Hawker said the airport does not have an update 
Instrument Landing System (ILS). It is currently trying 
to procure a refurbished one from Talis Germany, but is 
encountering problems from Talis France which requires 
that Africa be serviced by Talis France.  The problem, 
Hawker said, with procuring the system from France is 
that it does not sell older models and a new one is 
far beyond the price range for the airport.  Djibouti\'s 
airport also does not have at present the means to 
calibrate radio aides, and is currently waiting for 
assistance from the French military. 
 
NOTE: (SBU) Djibouti received an airport security 
management course coordinated through the DS 
Anti-Terrorism Assistance program in December 2002. 
Although the course was effective and beneficial for 
the Djiboutians that attended, it also pointed out 
several deficiencies that include, but are not 
limited to; the lack of legislation for airport 
operations; the need for a government organization to 
regulate the airport and bring it into compliance with 
ICAO; the need for the development of a national civil 
aviation plan, an airport security plan and an air 
carrier operations plan; and the establishment of 
crisis management and contingency plans to deal with 
catastrophic events. Unless Djibouti can meet some of 
these basic requirements no amount of physical security 
will be adequate to deal with a crisis situation. 
 
WHAT DPI PLANS FOR DJIBOUTI\'S AIRPORT 
------------------------------------- 
10. (U) DPI hopes the new traffic brought in by 
economic development projects will bring greater 
revenue from cargo shipment.  With the new port at 
Doraleh coming on-line next year, there have already 
been requests for the airport to provide significant 
amounts of equipment to handle trans-shipment through 
the airport.  Hawker said there are several Dubai 
companies that are looking towards Djibouti\'s planned 
Airport Free Zone as an option to expand their 
over-extended offices in Dubai.  The estimated target 
for tons shipped through Djibouti\'s airport is 20,000 
per year with routes going from Dubai to Central Africa. 
 
11. (SBU) Hawker explained that airport has the 
resources and funds ready to construct the Airport Free 
Zone but has stalled in hopes of a new runway.  He 
explained that since the area between the airport and 
the two camps - Camp Lemonier in particular - is so 
small, the airport cannot expand and still have 
sufficient area around it for regulations sake.  Hawker 
proposes that the American and French military could 
easily take over the whole of Ambouli Airport if they 
could construct a new runway for the airport.  He 
identified a small airstrip that the French military 
uses close to the city that could \"cost effectively be 
expanded\" and DPI would then put up the funding for a 
new terminal.  The airstrip identified is in a 
convenient location to the new port and to the highway. 
Hawker added that taking over the existing airport would 
be beneficial in many ways to Camp Lemonier, particularly 
in the issues of space and security.  The target 
completion date for the Airport Free Zone remains 
this year. 
 
HOW DJIBOUTI SEES SAFE SKIES 
---------------------------- 
12. (SBU) There is a general sentiment of impatience on 
the issue of Safe Skies.  Both Hawker and the Director of 
Civil Aviation, Almis Haid, have expressed disappointment, 
and slight displeasure, at what they describe as Embassy 
requests for improvements needed for the past three years 
running yet giving no definitive word on whether Djibouti 
is in or out of the Safe Skies program.  Hawker commented 
that Haid had felt slighted after attending programming in 
2003 as a potential participant because the Djiboutian 
delegation was not included, in his opinion, to a 
satisfactory degree.  Hawker said that he hoped the 
upcoming conference in Johannesburg will prove to be more 
fruitful. 
 
SAFE SKIES AND SECURITY PROGRAMS 
-------------------------------- 
13. (SBU) Although immigration controls are currently 
considered to be ponderous, unresponsive and prone to 
mistake and abuse, a USG sponsored counter-terrorism 
initiative (Terrorist Interdiction Program - PISCES) 
is under way that will assist the Djiboutians in 
bolstering their tracking and registration capabilities. 
Upon completion of Phase-1 of the program, the 
immigration service will be able to document and screen 
potential terrorists using a network of computer systems 
and bio-metrics.  This system will have real time reports 
generated that will be monitored by the Security 
Services and Embassy personnel. 
 
14. (SBU) Djibouti\'s security services have received 
several training courses through DS/ATA that concentrate 
on enhancing their counter-terrorism capabilities.  In 
addition to DS/ATA training, Djiboutian police officers 
have begun training at the International La Enforcement 
Academy (ILEA) in Gaborone, Botswana. Although ILEA 
training is not geared towards countering terrorism, it 
does concentrate on the professional development of 
police managers.  This sort of training will provide the 
Djiboutians with managerial and organizational skills 
that will translate into more effective and traditional 
security operations.

SUBJECT: MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER ON RECENT U.S. AND 
CUBA VISITS 
 
REF: STATE 213112 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Marguerita D. Ragsdale. 
For reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) In a meeting October 6 with Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, Ali Abdi Farah, Ambassador asked for the Minister\'s 
impression of his and President Guelleh\'s recent trip to the 
United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), which also included 
stops in Washington and Cuba.  Farah spoke in general terms 
about the activities at UNGA and about President Guelleh\'s 
speech, a matter of public record. Ambassador commented that 
she thought it had been a comprehensive speech. Farah also 
gave an account of Guelleh\'s meeting with Department of State 
Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Newman which 
dovetailed reftel. Farah added that the President had 
exchanged views with Under Secretary for Political Affairs 
Marc Grossman, who had commended him for Djibouti\'s role in 
the struggle against terrorism. (Note: Embassy Djibouti has 
not received a report of this exchange. End Note.) 
 
2. (C) Farah stated that in Washington, Guelleh met with 
Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, Senator John Warner of 
Virginia and Senator Carl Levin of Michigan.  Farah was not 
able to give substantive details of the meetings, but offered 
the view that they had gone very well and that the 
Congressmen were very well versed on Djibouti and had 
discussed economic assistance, military cooperation, and 
cooperation in the global war against terrorism. He remarked 
that \"one Congressman\" had mentioned a point about the 
U.S.-Djibouti military agreement and that President Guelleh 
had queried what exactly the Congressman meant to say. \"All 
in all,\" he said, \"the meetings went well.\" 
 
3. (C) On Guelleh\'s visit to Cuba, Farah told Ambassador that 
the purpose was mainly focused on establishing an exchange of 
doctors and possible medical training.  He said there is 
great difficulty in finding medical schools that will accept 
Djiboutian students due to a lack of places available. 
However, Cuba has places and three years ago gave twenty 
spots to Djiboutians.  Farah said the hope for these 
negotiations was to expand that number to forty, as well as 
negotiate a number of trained specialists to work in 
Djibouti.  Currently there are five medical specialists from 
Cuba working in Djibouti.  He commented that the Cuban 
doctors are not expensive and are very competent. The 
Government of Djibouti pays these doctors a small stipend and 
provides housing at their assigned locations in the outer 
districts. 
 
4. (C) Farah mentioned that he would depart tomorrow for 
Nairobi to attend the Somalia conference where the 
transitional parliament will elect a new President of 
Somalia.  A very large number had now been narrowed, 
according to Farah, to 28 - down from 70.  Responding to 
Ambassador\'s inquiry, Farah said he was optimistic on the 
issue of Somalia because for the first time every faction is 
represented and everyone is participating.  When asked what 
the future of the self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland 
would be, Farah said, \"we\'ll have to see.\"  Farah said 
Somaliland has been functioning well for nearly 15 years, but 
relations with Somalia cannot be predicted until the new 
president is chosen.  The identity and personality of the 
president will determine Somalia\'s course of action with 
Somaliland.  Farah commented, \"we will discuss it.\"

   IMPASSABLE DURING RAINY PERIODS.  TRAINS ARE UNSAFE FOR 
   TRAVEL BECAUSE OF AGING CONDITION OF ROLLING STOCK AND 
   RAILS.  ALSO, THE SINGLE RAIL LINE LEADING OUT OF 
   DJIBOUTI HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY TERRORIST ATTACKS. ONLY 
   ONE MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CARRIER OPERATES OUT OF 
   DJIBOUTI, WHILE THREE OTHER REGIONAL CARRIERS OPERATE 
   INFREQUENT FLIGHTS. 
 
C. ADEQUACY OF IN-COUNTRY TRANSPORT: DJIBOUTI LACKS 
   SAFE AND RELIABLE IN-COUNTRY PUBLIC TRANSPORT. ROAD 
   ACCIDENTS ARE ENDEMIC DUE TO A LACK OF A COUNTRYWIDE 
   VEHICLE INSPECTION SYSTEM AND POOR DRIVING HABITS. 
   TAXIS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE SUBSTANDARD AT BEST AND 
   USE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT OUTSIDE OF DJIBOUTI CITY IS 
   PROHIBITED ON SECURITY AND SAFETY GROUNDS. 
 
D. RECREATION FACILITIES: WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
   POST\'S SWIMMING POOL, SMALL EXERCISE ROOM AND TENNIS 
   COURT, FEW RECREATIONAL FACILITIES ARE PRESENT SIMILAR 
   TO THOSE FOUND AT LARGER POSTS. AS A SEP POST WITHOUT A 
   MARINE SECURITY DETACHMENT, INITIATIVES AROUND WHICH A 
   NUMBER OF COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES CAN BE ORGANIZED ARE 
   ABSENT. ON ITS OWN, POST IS TRYING TO DEVELOP AND 
   INAUGURATE A \"SNACK-BAR\" TO ENCOURAGE AND FOSTER 
   COMMUNITY-BASED ACTIVITIES AND A PLACE FOR MISSION 
   MEMBERS TO MEET AND DINE TOGETHER. HOWEVER, BRINGING 
   THIS FACILITY ON LINE OVER THE COMING MONTHS WILL NOT 
   IMMEDIATELY MITIGATE THE PROBLEM THAT NOW EXISTS. THERE 
   IS NO FACILITY FOR LARGE-SCALE INDOOR MEETINGS AWAY 
   FROM THE OPPRESSIVE HEAT.  THE AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE, 
   LOCATED ON THE COMPOUND, IS TOO SMALL TO ACCOMMODATE A 
   SINGLE GATHERING OF AMERICAN STAFF. IN THE \"TOWN\" OF 
   DJIBOUTI, LITTLE OR NO PERSONAL ENTERTAINMENT OUTLETS 
   EXIST, SUCH AS LIVE THEATER OR CINEMAS FEATURING FIRST- 
   RUN ENGLISH LANGUAGE FILMS. QUALITY RESTAURANTS THAT 
   MEET MINIMUM U.S. HEALTH STANDARDS ARE FEW. GIVEN THE 
   PAUCITY OF RECREATIONAL ALTERNATIVES, AMERICAN OFFICERS 
   ARE LEFT TO THEIR OWN INITIATIVE TO BREAK UP THE 
   MONOTONY OF THE HOME-TO-OFFICE-TO-HOME ROUTINE. YOUNG, 
   UNACCOMPANIED OFFICERS ON THEIR FIRST TOUR OF DUTY, ARE 
   MOST IMPACTED AND THEY COMPRISE THE GREATER VOLUME OF 
   AMERICAN OFFICER STAFF. 
 
E. HOUSING CONDITIONS: POST HOUSING CONDITIONS ARE 
   SATISFACTORY.  HOWEVER, DUE TO LACK OF CONSTRUCTION 
   INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE COUNTRY, EXPANDING THE POST\'S 
   HOUSING POOL TO MEET THE GROWING NEEDS OF NEWLY 
   ASSIGNED OFFICERS HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC.  ASSIGNED 
   OFFICERS WAITING IN TEMPORARY QUARTERS TO GET INTO 
   PERMANENT HOUSING IS ONE OF POST\'S MOST PRESSING 
   PROBLEMS. THE FRONT OFFICE HAS PUT \"QUALITY OF LIFE 
   ISSUES\" HIGH ON POST MANAGEMENT\'S PRIORITY LIST. 
   NONETHELESS, AS POST GROWS INTO ITS NEW EMBASSY 
   COMPOUND (NEC) PLANNED FOR CONSTRUCTION IN FY-07, 
   EXPANDING STAFFING LEVELS WILL KEEP PRESSURE ON 
   MANAGEMENT TO PROVIDE AN EVER-INCREASING HOUSING POOL 
   FOR ITS ICASS CLIENTS. 
 
F. UNSANITARY CONDITIONS: DJIBOUTI HAS INHERITED A 
   FRENCH COLONIAL MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS NOT 
   BEEN KEPT IN GOOD REPAIR.  CONSEQUENTLY, HUMAN WASTE 
   DRAINAGE AND TREATMENT IN A CITY BARELY ABOVE SEA LEVEL 
   PRESENTS A HEALTH PROBLEM CITYWIDE. LEACHING OF WASTE 
   INTO GROUND WATER IS ALSO A SPECIAL CONCERN IN USG 
   HOUSING AREAS WHERE OCCUPANTS MUST TAKE SPECIAL CARE TO 
   BOIL AND FILTER HOUSEHOLD WATER PRIOR TO CONSUMPTION. 
   MOREOVER, THE CITY LANDSCAPE IS LITTERED WITH SOLID 
   REFUSE AND THE COUNTRY LACKS AN EFFICIENT WASTE AND 
   COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL SYSTEM.  THESE CONDITIONS ALONE 
   POSE SPECIAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. 
 
G. LACK OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES: CITY POWER SUPPLY IN 
   DJIBOUTI IS NOT UP TO MINIMUM STANDARDS.  FREQUENT 
   OUTAGES AND \"BROWNOUTS\" STRAIN THE EMBASSY\'S CAPACITY 
   TO SUPPLY POWER TO HOUSEHOLDS AND THE WORK PLACE. 
   PROVISION AND USE OF STAND-BY GENERATORS AT EACH 
   LOCATION IS A MUST. SURGES IN POWER ARE CONSTANT 
   REMINDERS OF INADEQUATE POWER LEVELS. 
 
H. LACK OF ADEQUATE MEDICAL/DENTAL CARE: AGAIN, POST 
   MUST SUBMIT THAT MEDICAL CARE IN DJIBOUTI DOES NOT 
   APPROACH THE MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE LEVELS FOR SIMILAR CARE 
   IN THE U.S. OR EUROPE. POST HAS A SMALL HEALTH 
   TREATMENT FACILITY ON THE EMBASSY COMPOUND STAFFED BY A 
   TCN HEALTH CARE MANAGER, WITH THE RMO RESIDENT IN SANAA 
   AND SCHEDULED FOR VISITS TO POST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. 
   FOR EMERGENCY CARE, POST MUST RELY ON AN \"AS AVAILABLE\" 
   ARRANGEMENT IT HAS ESTABLISHED WITH A FRENCH FACILITY 
   RESERVED FOR TREATMENT OF FRENCH MILITARY PERSONNEL. 
   FOR A COMPLETE REPORT ON BASIC MEDICAL CARE AT POST SEE 
   STATE MED\'S WEB SITE ON THE INTRANET. 
 
I. PREVALENCE OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE: FOLLOWING IS A 
   REPRESENTATIVE LIST OF DISEASES ENDEMIC TO DJIBOUTI: 
   COLDS AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES, DIARRHEA, HEPATITIS, 
   MALARIA, DENGUE FEVER, TUBERCULOSIS, SCHISTOSOMIASIS, 
   AND HIV/AIDS. MALARIA PROPHYLAXIS IS REQUIRED. 
 
J. UNUSUAL PERSONAL HAZARDS: IN ADDITION TO THOSE 
   STATED ABOVE, POST OFFERS PARTICULAR CHALLENGES AND 
   HAZARDS BECAUSE OF ITS UNIQUE LOCATION AS A FOCAL POINT 
   FOR THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.  ALTHOUGH, RISK OF 
   VIOLENT CRIME IS REMOTE, DISPLACED PERSONS FROM 
   SURROUNDING COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO FIND THEIR WAY TO THE 
   STREETS OF DJIBOUTI CREATING A POTENTIALLY VOLATILE 
   ENVIRONMENT. AS STATED ABOVE, THE POOR STATE OF 
   DJIBOUTI\'S TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE PLACES POST 
   PERSONNEL AT GREATER RISK FROM ACCIDENTS ALONE. 
 
K. EXCESSIVE COST OF TRANSPORTATION FROM POST TO A 
   SUITABLE RELIEF AREA:  TRANSPORTATION COSTS ON THE 
   SINGLE EUROPEAN CARRIER WHICH SERVICES DJIBOUTI, AIR 
   FRANCE, COMPARE FAVORABLY TO OTHER CARRIER AIR 
   TRANSPORT COSTS SERVICING THE SAME ROUTE, OR 
   ALTERNATIVE RELIEF LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE HORN OF 
   AFRICA REGION. ON A COST COMPARATIVE BASIS, COST OF 
   TRAVEL TO AN ALTERNATE RELIEF AREA FAR EXCEED THE COST 
   OF THE DIRECT ROUTE TO THE PRESENT DESIGNATED R&R 
   POINT. 
 
2. (U) POST STRONGLY RECOMMENDS REDESIGNATION OF 
DJIBOUTI AS ELIGIBLE FOR R&R TRAVEL BASED ON CONTINUING 
HEALTH AND WELFARE NEEDS AS OUTLINE ABOVE.

-------------------------------- 
1. Summary of Significant Events 
-------------------------------- 
 
A. Narrative Overview of Significant Events 
 
1. (U) RSO took R&R during the third quarter at which time 
TDY RSO Jeff Pursell filled in for the majority of time while 
ARSO James Jewett (Kampala) filled the gap for the last two 
weeks.  RSO would like to acknowledge the outstanding support 
provided by both TDY RSOs, particularly the wealth of 
experience and knowledge that RSO Pursell shared with the 
Embassy and US Military personnel. Details of RSO Pursell\'s 
TDY were forwarded to DS/IP/AF upon departure. 
 
2. (SBU) RSO Continues to work very closely with Host Nation 
counterparts and representatives of the Terrorist 
Interdiction Program to finalize the implementation of the 
program.  Technical setbacks have taken a toll on the 
project, but completion is at approximately 90%.  Final 
implementation is expected to be completed by 12/2004. 
 
In addition to the TIP/PISCES team, RSO supported other 
visitors to Post to include: 
 
- 07/24 to 07/26 - EDP Trainer, Kirk Baumann, for training 
and maintenance of detection equipment 
- 07/26 to 08/04 - Regional FMO, Felipe Cayabyab, for 
facilities review 
- 08/04 to 08/07 - STS John McKenna to repair technical 
security equipment. 
- 08/08 to 08/10 - CODEL Payne 
- 08/09 to 08/09 - CENTCOM CMDR - General Abizaid 
- 08/16 to 08/19 - Ship visit by the USS Denver 
- 08/23 to 08/23 - CODEL Miller 
 
3. (SBU) RSO has not received any reports of attacks on 
Americans during this quarter. As reported before, RSO and 
embassy personnel continue to monitor crime trends and RSO 
continues to work closely with host nation police to ensure 
the safety of all personnel. Reports of petty theft, fraud, 
assault, battery, sexual deviation, and unlawful trade 
continue to be reported informally.  Two violent crimes 
occurred within the city limits in the last month of the 
quarter, but neither crime was aimed at Americans.  One of 
the crimes involved two French military soldiers being 
stabbed by a Djiboutian national.  Host Nation Police have 
concluded that the incident was the result of alcohol abuse. 
 
4. (U) The First session of the International Law Enforcement 
Academy (ILEA), Law Enforcement Executive Development Program 
(LEEDP) began during the third quarter.  10 members of the 
Djiboutian government participated in session 12 of the 
LEEDP.  RSO received positive comments from senior leadership 
as to the professionalism of ILEA staff and the extensive 
curriculum of the ILEA. 
 
B. Mission Wide Emergency Action Drills: 
 
1. Chancery:  Although Post did not conduct traditional 
Embassy wide drills during this quarter, Post continues to 
develop and carry out emergency response drills with U.S. 
Military elements assigned to assist the mission in case of a 
crisis.  Several scenarios were acted out that took into 
consideration the need for U.S. Military components to assist 
the RSO in providing a defensive posture for the Chief of 
Mission as well as strengthening the physical security of the 
compound.  The USMC\'s Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team 
(FAST) out of Bahrain, conducted an exercise aimed at 
securing the compound and enhancing existing Mission 
security. 
 
(a) Bomb Drill - Projected for 4th Qtr 
(b) Fire Drill - Projected for 4th Qtr 
(c) Emergency Destruction Drill - projected for 4th Qtr 
(d) D&C Drill - 03/18/2004

A.  (SBU) Post did not convene the EAC during the 3rd 
quarter.  Post continues to be rated as critical for 
trans-national terrorism. RSO and other EMBOFFs continue to 
work closely with Host nation counter parts to monitor 
activity and strengthen cooperation.  RSO is working closely 
with DS, ORA, US Military and FBI personnel to monitor and 
coordinate threat reporting.

SUBJECT: FRANCE\'S MILITARY COMMANDER IN DJIBOUTI DESIRES 
GREATER REGIONAL FOCUS FOR FRENCH FORCES 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1.  (C) During the Ambassador\'s regular weekly meeting 
October 21 with General Michel Arrault, Commander of French 
Military Forces in Djibouti, General Arrault related his 
desire to have his forces become more active in regional 
security matters.  He said the threat of terrorism in this 
part of the world is certainly a factor in his thinking.  The 
General mentioned a trip undertaken by members of the French 
armed forces stationed in Djibouti to Massawa, Eritrea during 
the first week of October.  While the General did not 
elaborate on the activities of his forces during their visit, 
he said there were difficulties in working with the Eritrean 
government. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador observed that the unresolved conflict over 
border issues between Ethiopia and Eritrea may lead to 
Ethiopian suspicions about French-Eritrean cooperation, given 
the penchant for conspiratorial thinking among the two 
states.  Arrault agreed but did not comment on whether a 
similar visit of his forces was planned in the near future 
for Ethiopia.  Meanwhile, post has learned that the 5th 
Marine Overseas Regiment (Regiment Interarmee d\'Outre-Mer) of 
French Forces stationed in Djibouti is set to conduct 
training in Ethiopia to prepare Ethiopian forces for 
peacekeeping duty.  We do not have dates for such training. 
We note, however, that during the meeting with Ambassador, 
General Arrault queried whether peacekeeping by African Union 
forces anywhere in the Horn -- specifically in Darfur or in 
Somalia -- could work without significant physical 
involvement, and infusion of money, by external powers such 
as the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  Post views General Arrault\'s expressed 
desire for greater regional involvement as a significant 
shift in policy for French Forces Djibouti (FFDJ).  Both 
General Arrault and his predecessor, in prior conversations 
with us, have been consistently  negative toward the 
possibility of greater FFDJ participation in regional 
security matters.  Instead, they have stressed that France\'s 
sole mandate in Djibouti -- unlike our own -- is to uphold 
the bilateral defense agreement existing between Djibouti and 
France that guarantees France\'s defense of Djibouti against 
external attack.  Both he and his predecessor have routinely 
explained that FFDJ requires the approval of Paris for 
greater participation in Coalition activities such as those 
conducted by the Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa 
(CJTF-HOA) and the Combined Task Force - 150 (CTF-150).  We 
do not know if this new stance reflects merely General 
Arrault\'s desire and action or is at the direction of Paris. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: RPP CONGRESS OFFICIALLY NOMINATES GUELLEH FOR 
RE-ELECTION AS PRESIDENT 
 
-------------- 
Summary 
-------------- 
1.   (U) The RPP (People\'s Rally for Progress), the 
ruling party in the Djiboutian Government, held its 
annual Central Committee Congress October 6 and 7. 
The two-day event consisted of an ordinary session of 
the central committee, a body of 250 members gathered 
from around the country, and a second extraordinary 
session designating the party\'s candidate for the 
coming 2005 presidential elections. The congress 
nominated, as predicted, current President of the 
Republic of Djibouti, Ismail Omar Guelleh, as candidate 
for his own succession. Guelleh spoke on a broad base 
of national concerns in an address that seemed more 
like a campaign program. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The President of the People\'s Rally for Progress 
Party (RPP), Ismail Omar Guelleh, vice-president, 
Dileita Mohamed Dileita (Prime Minister of Djibouti), 
and General Secretary, Idriss Arnaoud Ali (President of 
the National Assembly), presided over and spoke at the 
October 6-7 congress in which the RPP nominated its 
candidate, Ismail Omar Guelleh, for President of 
Djibouti.  Hundreds of party members and sympathizers, 
as well as all members of government, community and 
religious leaders attended the Congress.   Guelleh gave 
a detailed assessment of what has been done in the RPP 
and emphasized that all party members and sympathizers 
should have knowledge about the political, economic and 
social situation of the country. He praised the 250 RPP 
Central Committee members for their critiques on the 
functioning of the party. 
 
3. (U) The General secretary reviewed the general 
policy of the party and its activity report. For the 
time being, RPP has 34 satellite offices spread 
throughout country. He asked the President of the party 
to think about how to fund political parties broadly 
since the multiparty concept is integral to the 
country\'s political infrastructure and political 
parties in Djibouti now have some serious financial 
problems that might jeopardize or compromise their 
existence. A juridical framework must be found for 
funding political associations. \"It would be 
democratically and politically correct that political 
parties benefit from public funding,\" the Secretary 
General added. On visits of party officials to the 
different satellite offices, he said the main 
complaints heard were about unemployment and lack of 
state documentation, such as the National Identity 
Card. The 2004 budget of the RPP is 23 millions FDJ 
(130 000 USD), of which 70% is provided by the state. 
 
4. (U) The second day of the congress was the official 
nomination of Ismail Omar Guelleh as the RPP candidate 
for re-election as president in 2005. Prime Minister 
Deleita announced the name of the candidate, which was 
followed by a standing ovation. The RPP is in an 
alliance composed of three other parties, FRUD (Front 
for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy), PPSD 
(Peoples Social democratic Party) and PND (National 
Democratic Party). The coalition parties were also 
represented at the congress. Mr. Aden Robleh Awaleh, 
president of PND, sent a press release from South 
Africa, where he is currently working as a Permanent 
Member of the Parliament of the African Union, 
supporting the candidacy of Guelleh. Guelleh requested 
an appointment with the other political parties in the 
ruling coalition, after the month of Ramadan at the end 
of November, to consider adopting a joint strategy. 
 
5. (U) In his acceptance speech before the congress, 
Guelleh drew an overall picture of what appeared to be 
his program for his second mandate. He emphasized that 
improving the situation of the poor is a necessary 
task. \"Actions have to be taken to promote social and 
economic progress for our weakest fellow-citizens, the 
most vulnerable and most fragile ones\" he said. 
Addressing government officials he stated, \"Whichever 
person is eager to be invested in the destiny of the 
national community must be measured by his capacity for 
humility, responsibility and competence while 
subjecting himself to the regulations of the 
Constitution.\" In remarks clearly directed at 
Djibouti\'s youth, Guelleh said he wanted to give back 
to the youth both confidence and initiative. For women 
in Djibouti, they should have their rightful place and 
role in the national community. As for economic policy, 
Guelleh said he wanted it targeted towards the needs of 
human beings so that poverty can be reduced. He said in 
his speech, he wished to launch a massive campaign of 
literacy programs in rural areas. He said that a sound 
economy exists where reasonable choices are made, and 
is founded on \"transparency, respect for universal 
management norms, and macroeconomic stability\". 
 
6. (U) The means and logistics put in place to 
guarantee a large gathering for the congress were 
primarily ground transportation. Buses were rented to 
transport party members and sympathizers from all over 
the country. Photos of the president and copies of 
speeches in French and Arabic were distributed to all 
800 persons present in the Congress Palace.

1. (U) Summary: The 30th general assembly of the Permanent 
Conference of African and French Consular Chambers (CPCCAF) 
took place in Djibouti from October 3 to October 6, 2004. 
Several Djiboutian high officials in the Djiboutian 
government, the President of the CPCCAF and the French 
Ambassador spoke at the opening ceremony.  Ninety delegates 
from 23 Chambers of Commerce members met in Djibouti to 
discuss the ways and means to strengthen partnerships 
between the French Chambers of Commerce and the African 
Chambers of Commerce.  This was the first time the General 
Assembly of the CPCCAF was held in Djibouti, East Africa. 
Pol/Econ and Econ/Com Asst spoke with Mr. Youssouf Tani, 
Vice-President of the Chamber of Commerce of Djibouti (CCD) 
and the Chief Coordinator for the conference, who seemed

Summary 
 
2. (U) The Prime Minister, the French Ambassador, the 
President of the CPCCAF, the President of the Chamber of 
Commerce of Djibouti and the Minister of Trade took turn to 
speak at the inauguration day.  The Djiboutian officials 
saluted the decision of the CPCCAF to hold its general 
assembly in Djibouti for the first time.  They elaborated on 
Djibouti\'s advantages including stability, liberal economic 
regime, strategic location, modern telecom but most of all 
the potential of the port of Doraleh as a regional 
distribution center.  They also commended the pertinence of 
the projects funded by the CPCCAF, which address the real 
needs of its African members.  Full of confidence, 
Ambassador of France to the Republic of Djibouti Phillipe 
Selz reiterated France\'s intention to continue to support 
the CPCCAF initiative, which is \"strengthening ties between 
France and the African countries\". 
 
3. (U) Ninety delegates representing Chambers of Commerce 
from Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central Africa, Comoros, 
Congo, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar, 
Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Chad, Togo, Rwanda, and 
France flew to Djibouti for the occasion.  The general 
assembly is held at a different African country every year 
but it is the first time that it is organized in Djibouti. 
According to Mr. Paul Obambi, President of the CPCCAF, 
President Guelleh requested Djibouti to be the venue of this 
30th assembly during his visit to France in 2002.  Mr. 
Obambi added that the CCD also played a major role in 
convincing the CPCCAF to organize its general assembly in 
Djibouti 
 
4. (U) Created in 1973, the CPCCAF is a cooperative 
association between France and its former African colonies. 
The CPCCAF, based in Paris is designed to provide technical 
assistance to the African chambers of commerce, which should 
result in better services to the African businesses.  One 
major objective of the CPCCAF is to mobilize the existing 
expertise within the CPCCAF and share it with other members 
to build their capacity, which is necessary for a well- 
structured and dynamic private sector.  The main topics of 
discussion included Institutional Capacity Building & Good 
Governance, Support to Firms & Development of Industrial and 
Commercial Services, Professional Training & Employment, 
Infrastructure & Investment, and Agriculture. 
 
5. (U) Mr. Tani said that he was satisfied with the 
assistance that the CCD received from its French 
counterparts.  For instance, the International Chamber of 
Commerce of Grenoble (France) trained two elected members of 
the CCD about their specific job fields.   The CCD also 
benefited from a training program of its members on private 
business management.  In addition, the CPCCAF organized a 
seminar for the Djiboutians tour operators.  Furthermore, 
the International Chamber of Commerce of Rouen (France) 
organized a visit to the port of Rouen, which has many 
similarities with the port of Djibouti, which was attended 
by Djiboutian businesses.  Seen as extremely important to 
Djibouti\'s economic development, the CCD has recently 
requested technical assistance from Paris International 
Chamber of Commerce in setting up a Regional Mediation 
Center in Djibouti.  This center will have the purpose of 
settling any commercial dispute as a legal alternative to 
the Court, which is slow and not always transparent.  It is 
expected that this initiative will bring some comfort to 
national and foreign investors. 
 
6. (U) Mr. Tani indicated that the conference was very 
successful and the CCD reached its target of introducing 
Djibouti to the CPCCAF, which represents more than 1 million 
African and French businesses.  The CPCCAF members visited 
the Port of Doraleh, which remains \"the most important 
infrastructure realized in East Africa\" according to Mr. 
Obambi.   Mr. Obambi assured that the African business 
community would be closely following the economic 
developments in Djibouti.  Mr. Tani said that the CPCCAF has 
been so successful that many countries are offering to join 
and that is an issue being discussed by the members of the 
CPCCAF.  He felt, however, that increasing the numbers of 
members will make the grouping \"impersonal\" and will damage 
all the affinities that have developed between the members 
over the years. Holding this general assembly in Djibouti 
shows the will of Djibouti officials to consolidate economic 
ties with France. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: To mark the importance of this event, 
almost the entire Ministerial Cabinet was present at the 
opening day, which confirms the current tendency of the GOD 
to show good faith and re-establish normal relations with 
France.  The limited assistance offered by the CPCCAF brings 
good benefits to the Chamber of Commerce of Djibouti.  It is 
clear, however, that the CPCCAF serves above all France\'s 
best economic and strategic interest.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (SBU) During a U.N. Day reception October 24, Ambassador 
spoke with Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) 
Executive Secretary Dr. H. Bashir Attalla regarding the U.S. 
understanding that the newly elected President of the Somali 
Transitional Federal Government, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, and 
Speaker of the new Somalia Transitional Federal Assembly, 
Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan, had wished to travel to the U.S. 
with a small group of advisors the preceding week. (See 
reftel)  Ambassador told Attalla the U.S. viewed such a visit 
as premature and had indicated its belief that it should be 
postponed. 
 
2. (C) Attala agreed that such a visit was premature and said 
IGAD had advised Yusuf, who was then in Ethiopia, of this. 
Attalla expressed personal disappointment that Yusuf had not 
focused on building a government in Mogadishu.  He commented 
that Yusuf preferred obviously to travel around the world, 
seek money, and perform a ceremonial presidential role. 
IGAD\'s advice to him, Attalla said, was to first get a 
government together in Mogadishu. 
 
3. (C) Attalla also commented that he had little personal 
confidence in Yusuf, whose purchase of his position as 
President of the Somali Transitional Federal Government is 
\"an open secret.\"  Attalla was also concerned that Yusuf may 
not be well, physically, as he has undergone a liver 
transplant, and that he is at least 10 years older than the 
age he publicizes. (Note:  According to Attalla, Yusuf is at 
least 79 vice 69. End note).  Moreover, Attalla questioned 
whether Yusuf had the intellectual capability for long-term 
leadership and nation-building. 
 
4. (C) On the Somalia conference to be held in Sweden October 
29, Ambassador asked Attalla if he or an IGAD representative 
would attend.  Attalla responded that IGAD would not be 
represented.  He said he believed the matter of Somalia 
should now be picked up actively by donor nations.  His 
preference, Attalla said, would be to shift IGAD\'s long-term 
focus from conflict management and peace-seeking to broader 
matters of regional policy.

SUBJECT: BORREL AFFAIR: ATTORNEY GENERAL SUMMONED TO 
FRANCE 
 
1. (U) Summary: French magistrate Bernard Borrel, found 
dead 80 Km north of Djibouti in 1995, has surfaced once 
again in the national media. The Court of Versailles in 
Paris summoned (for September 30th, 2004) Procureur de la 
Republique (Attorney General of Djibouti), Djama 
Souleiman, to present himself before the examining French 
magistrate to respond to a complaint entered by the widow 
of Bernard Borrel. For over ten years the case has 
remained open amid Mrs. Borrel\'s claims that members of 
the Government of Djibouti assassinated her husband 
because he discovered incriminating information regarding 
the 1990 bombing of the Caf de Paris in Djibouti City. 
Souleiman did not feel obligated to answer the summons 
from the French judge because, he said, \"Djibouti is an 
independent and sovereign country.\" End summary. 
 
2. (U) The government run newspaper, La Nation, ran the 
transcript of an (October 4th, 2004) interview with 
Procurer de la Republique, Djama Souleiman, regarding the 
summons by French magistrates to appear in court for 
testimony in the ongoing Borrel case. Djibouti\'s Attorney 
General, Djama Souleiman, was called (for Sept.30th) to 
testify in France before the examining judge in the case 
of the apparent murder of Judge Bernard Borrel in 
Djibouti in 1995.  The widow of the deceased brought the 
case to the French courts after a joint Djiboutian-French 
tribunal ruled the cause of death could not be 
determined.  Borrel\'s widow holds the belief that members 
of the Djiboutian Government assassinated her husband. 
When questioned as to why he did not respond to the 
judge\'s request, Souleiman said, \"French magistrates 
forget easily that Djibouti is an independent and 
sovereign country. They still think that Djibouti is a 
French territory. There is a judicial agreement between 
Djibouti and France since September 27th 1986 and that if 
they want to call me, they have to go through that 
procedure\". He highlighted that each country must respect 
the legal procedures of that agreement. 
3. (U) On the issue of whether the media\'s actions in the 
Borrel affair would damage the case, Souleiman commented 
that the wife of Judge Borrel has decided to believe in 
the assassination thesis although it is a suicide. On the 
other hand, Mr. Souleiman pointed the finger to the 
lawyer of Mrs. Borell, whom in his opinion \"has with 
racist condescension created an imaginary country where 
anything can happen.\" He continued, \"These racist 
attitudes find some echoes in certain media\'s treatment 
of Africa and Africans with contempt.\" 
4. (U) The approach of Djibouti\'s next presidential 
election and the sensationalist media coverage of this 
case is linked, according to Souleiman who stated the 
goal of Mrs. Borrel and her lawyers is to destabilize 
Djibouti.  He continued to say, \"they will have no 
influence,\" and admonished the French justice to stay 
impartial. 
5. (U) The question regarding the effect on the relations 
between France and Djibouti elicited a positive answer 
from Souleiman. He stated that the official reactions of 
the French government and the \"warlike declarations\" of 
Mrs. Borell have to be dissociated. In response to the 
query of how effective the judicial cooperation had been 
between the two countries, Souleiman concluded that 
during the last ten years Djibouti had done everything 
possible to satisfy the French justices. He said, \"I know 
of no place in the world that would open the doors of its 
presidency to a foreign institution for investigations 
purposes. We did that. Cooperation in all fields to be 
effective must have some reciprocity\". 
6. (SBU) Comment: In the past after the French media has 
brought up the Borrel affair, the Djiboutian national 
media runs stories against France. This occasion the 
government media sources in Djibouti were silent.  There 
are two thoughts as to why the government has not 
responded in the usual manner. First, the French Minister 
of Justice was heard the next day in Radio France 
International (French official radio broadcasted 
worldwide) and highlighted the obligation of presumption 
of innocence and admonished the judges not to hurry in 
any conclusions. Second, the joint statement issued 
recently from the French Defense and Foreign Affairs 
ministries was released clarifying their respective 
positions towards Djibouti and this case. This statement 
seemed to satisfy Djibouti officials.  Embassy lawyer 
Alain Martinet was also called to testify and did agree 
to the request of the French courts.

1. (U) Alleged violations of labor rights have come to the 
forefront of opposition party attentions after the Fourth 
Congress of International Education held in Porto-Allegre, Brazil 
16-26 July, 2004.  In its first few issues back from their summer 
holiday, La Realite, the opposition journal published by the 
Republican Alliance for Democracy (ARD), reported that the Porto- 
Allegre Congress on Education in global progress condemned 
Djibouti\'s union liberties and that a six point resolution was 
passed which demanded an end to alleged violations of labor 
rights there. End summary. 
 
2. (U) The Congress of International Education, an international 
education union from 161 countries, which represents 315 
organizations in which 26 million persons are affiliated. Two 
Djibouti education syndicates were represented in the fourth 
Congress: First Degree Syndicate (SEP) and Second Degree 
Syndicate (SYNESED). SEP and SYNESED are both affiliated with the 
Union of Djibouti Workers (UDT). Souleiman Ahmed Mohamed, ex- 
General Secretary of SYNESED and current Deputy General Secretary 
of UDT attended the congress. According to Ahmed, Djibouti was 
condemned for blocking development of syndicate liberties and 
violations of ILO Conventions. The Congress voted unanimously to 
approve a six-point resolution, according to the La Realite 
report. It reportedly required the Government of Djibouti to 
proceed unconditionally with the professional reintegration of 
all those who were sanctioned because of their union activities. 
The congress asked Djibouti to put an end to the obstacles to 
union liberties, to recognize and respect their freedom and 
independence as they are affiliated with international 
organizations like the International Confederation of Free 
Syndicates (CISL) and the International Education Congress. The 
final requirement was that Djibouti should open negotiations with 
unions and the chaotic situation has to come to an end. 
 
3. (U) Post would appreciate any information Embassy Brasilia can 
provide on this conference and any resolutions passed concerning 
Djibouti.

journal   of  the  ruling  party  RPP  (People\'s  Rally   for 
Progress),  carried  an  overview of  President  Ismail  Omar 
Guelleh\'s interview with BBC Somali while in New York  during 
Guelleh\'s recent trip to the U.S and Cuba.  In the interview, 
Guelleh reportedly focused on his goals for the New York  and 
Washington visits.  He also touched on relations between  the 
United States and Djibouti, the peace process in Somalia  and 
the American military base in Djibouti. End Summary. 
2.  (U)  According to Le Progres, the journal of  the  ruling 
RPP, President Guelleh spoke recently on BBC Somali about the 
main  goal  of  his visit to New York, which  was  the  peace 
process in Somalia. For him, the major issue was to set aside 
the   obstacles   that  have  ruined  the   preceding   peace 
conferences. Discussions with Secretary General of the United 
Nations, Kofi Annan, were mainly about Somalia. \"I asked  him 
to  receive  the  IGAD ministers to see developments  of  the 
peace  process  and  inform  the  Security  Council,  Guelleh 
reportedly  stated. Kofi Annan had responded that  \"It\'s  the 
first  time the six IGAD countries adopted a common  position 
on  Somalia.\" In the event, that the upcoming election  of  a 
transitional Somalian president disappoints warlords who  are 
seeking  a presidential seat, Guelleh stated \"We agreed  that 
the  Security  Council should execute its threat  and  brings 
those people to international justice 
3.  Regarding the purpose of his visit to Washington, Guelleh 
said  the  visit focused on meeting Senate and  congressional 
officials that are responsible for international, African and 
military issues. \"We\'re exchanging points of view on  how  to 
reinforce  peace  in Somalia.\"  Guelleh added  that  he  also 
\"wanted   to  meet  the  legislators  that  control  American 
policy.\"  Responding  to  a question  on  the  United  States 
choosing Djibouti as site for a major American military  base 
and  what  the  United  States  thinks  of  Somalia,  Guelleh 
responded \"They told me that they were outside of the  inter- 
Somali peace process discussions so far because they had  bad 
memories  in operation Restore Hope. But now they  intend  to 
support  the  new Somali government because it will  have  no 
ties   with   international  terrorism,  Guelleh   reportedly 
stated.\"

SUBJECT: RULING COALITION PARTIES REACT TO RPP CONGRESS 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 1356 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) In the days after the ruling party, People\'s Rally for 
Progress (RPP), held their conference nominating current 
President Ismail Omar Guelleh as the party\'s choice for 
presidential candidate in the 2005 elections, word of 
discontent from the ruling coalition partners started to 
surface.  Some Majority Union for Peace (UMP), the ruling 
coalition comprised of RPP, Front for the Restoration of 
Unity and Democracy (FRUD), Popular Party for Social 
Democracy (PPDS) and National Democratic Party (PND), party 
representatives are apparently feeling cheated by Guelleh and 
the RPP holding a single party congress. 
 
2. (C) Word on the street reports that a UMP meeting one 
month prior to the RPP congress was held in order to 
determine a plan of action for the upcoming campaign season. 
It is said that in this meeting the four parties agreed to 
hold a joint congress to nominate the coalition candidate for 
the 2005 election.  PPDS and FRUD members say the leadership 
was surprised to hear Guelleh and RPP had decided to hold a 
unilateral congress.  The party leadership also feels bruised 
egos from Guelleh\'s call on the second day of the RPP 
congress for the other three parties in the UMP coalition to 
meet and adopt a joint position, something that was 
reportedly formulated and decided upon one month prior in the 
UMP meeting. The general thought is Guelleh wanted to 
reassert his party\'s status as the sole party that really 
gathers and rallies the masses. 
 
3. (C) For the PPDS, two major personalities appear to be 
leading the party, both of which are reportedly feeling 
cheated and mistreated by the RPP.  Moumin Bahdon, former 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Boulaleh Barreh, former 
Minister of Interior, are the driving force in PPDS and both 
carry significant political and tribal weight. Bahdon and 
Barreh are both of Issa origin but come from the two major 
sub-clans that oppose the Mamassan sub-clan (Guelleh\'s 
sub-clan of origin). The two reportedly intend to \"show their 
muscles\" in the months before the election, knowing that it 
would show the danger of collapse in Guelleh\'s coalition. The 
idea of the appearance of a weak coalition and slight 
political disturbances is likely not to reflect well on the 
external image of Djibouti. This occurrence would be contrary 
to everything Guelleh has worked to portray over the course 
of his tenure as President.  Rumors have it that PPDS may use 
this tactic as a bargaining chip with Guelleh in order to up 
their profile in government from just a Ministerial level to 
a higher level in the Administration and security forces. 
(Note: It has been said that this last request may be because 
Bahdon had militia that was discreetly integrated into the 
Army beginning this year. End Note.) Contacts within the PPDS 
also mention that the party has the beginnings of a 
generational conflict between \"the rising generation\" and 
\"the old dinosaurs.\" 
 
4. (C) The FRUD leadership is rumored to believe that the RPP 
has \"misbehaved\" and demands reparation. FRUD already holds 
one ministerial position and 13 parliamentary seats. FRUD has 
seen a sudden increase in young Issa membership. Some believe 
this is in order to better portray itself as a national party 
and further remove itself from the Afar rebellion roots that 
created it. (Note: FRUD was one of the Afar parties that 
rebelled in the early nineties, which started the country\'s 
civil war. At the time of the peace accords in 1995, a 
portion of FRUD leadership joined the government and the rest 
remained in armed rebellion until the peace accords in 2001. 
The latter faction of FRUD, headed by Ahmed Dini Ahmed, is 
now the opposition party Republican Alliance for Democracy 
(ARD). End Note.) 
 
5. (C) The PND, headed by Aden Robleh Awaleh, has become the 
suspicious party in the coalition. Awaleh\'s fax, read the day 
of the RPP\'s announcement of Guelleh as their candidate, has 
apparently surprised the two other coalition members as much 
as, some say, high-ups in his own party. Opponents of Awaleh 
are suspect of his actions and say that he had curried great 
favor with Guelleh. Also it is said that his appointment to 
the Parliament of the African Union in Johannesburg is a 
reward from Guelleh and he is using it as an opportunity to 
create business connections for himself and Guelleh. 
 
6. (C) On the part of the RPP, it now appears that Guelleh is 
more at ease following the death of Ahmed Dini Ahmed, leader 
of ARD. Dini\'s presence has been a strong counter-balance to 
Guelleh in the past.  Guelleh is said to be in good shape 
politically and is untroubled by Dini\'s successor, Ahmed 
Youssouf, because Youssouf is not very active or charismatic. 
 Guelleh is said to be taking the attitude that there is no 
large threat to his position and that the other parties of 
the coalition should stay in the background and wait for his 
gifts. 
 
7. (C) Comment: Post cannot accurately comment on how much of 
the above rumor is truth. The  majority of it is reported 
through party members or word on the street. We will continue 
to keep close watch on both ruling party and opposition 
activities leading up to the election in 2005. These rumors 
and reports from within the parties could indicate that 
everything is not completely calm on either side of the 
Djiboutian political fence.

1. (U) Summary: The international Saudi newspaper Al Sharq Al 
Awsat reported on October 25th that the brainchild of the 
latest series of European aid workers killings in Somaliland 
has been caught. The Somali terrorist, who is said to be an 
activist of Al Ittihad Al Islamiya, a terror group linked to 
Al Qaeda, was caught in Ethiopia and the Ethiopian authorities 
handed him over to the self-proclaimed Government of 
Somaliland. Both the Al Sharq Al-Awsat and BBC Somali reports 
claim the U.S Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa based 
in Djibouti, participated in the extradition operation. End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) On October 25th the London based Saudi newspaper 
reported a press conference given by the Somaliland Minister 
of Interior, Ismail Adam Osman, who stated that there are new 
developments in the cases of European aid workers killed in 
Somaliland in late 2003 and early 2004. The minister stated 
that Ethiopian forces has handed over a Somali national 
suspected to be behind a number of terrorist operations that 
took place in Somaliland. The man called \"Mohamed Ali Issa\" is 
suspected to have arranged the assassination of one Kenyan 
national and one German national, working in the German non- 
governmental organization \"GTZ\" in early 2004 and the killing 
of two British teachers in the Somaliland city of \"Sheikh\" in 
October 2003. The minister said in his statement to the press, 
\"the suspect fled to Mogadishu, he was caught there and 
sustained injuries to his leg during the pursuit. He was moved 
to Djibouti to get necessary medical treatment. After that the 
Ethiopian forces handed the suspect to us.\" The report did not 
indicate if the minister identified those who arrested the 
suspected murderer. 
 
3. (U) Al Sharq Al-Awsat also reported information gathered 
from Somali news sources, which allege that CJTF- HOA, 
described as U.S counter-terrorist forces based in Djibouti, 
aided in the capture of Mohamed Ali Issa. The press conference 
reported that Somaliland authorities have indicted Al Ittihad 
Al Islamia (AIAI) and Al Qaeda networks for being responsible 
for the assassinations. The Minister continued that ten people 
have now been arrested in Hargeisa under the same charges and 
are waiting trial. Al Sharq Al Awsat ended its report by 
reminding that AIAI has been designated as a terrorist 
organization by the United States after the 9/11 events and 
considers it as Al Qaeda\'s arm in the Horn of Africa region.

politics have led to the release of demands to the Government 
of Djibouti for transparency in the upcoming presidential 
election. Reiterating many of the points stated in their 
unanswered letter to the Government 21 May 2004, the four 
leaders of the opposition coalition parties released a joint 
press statement demanding certain measures to ensure 
transparency in the election. Among the demands are a 
reformation and publication of electoral lists to ensure that 
they reflect the actual population, establishment of a 
National Independent Electoral Commission composed to 
impartial voters, and equal access to public media during the 
campaign. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The opposition coalition, Democratic Union for 
Alternance (UAD), published a joint press released signed by 
the leaders of the four parties demanding transparency 
measures be established to ensure a fair, democratic election 
in the upcoming presidential race, expected to be held April 
2005. UAD has repeatedly requested that the Government follow 
through on promises made in the 1992 constitution and 2001 
peace accord between the Government and the Armed faction of 
Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) - now 
opposition party Republican Alliance for Democracy. Among 
these promises are decentralization elections to establish 
regional councils which have greater autonomy for each 
district, the creation of a special statute regarding 
Djibouti City - which has been separated from what is now 
Arta district, the establishment of a communication law 
allowing the opening of independent radio and television, as 
well as the repayment of fees submitted by candidates in the 
2003 legislative elections. 
 
3. (U) Along with these promises, the opposition also 
believes it is necessary to amend certain policies regarding 
elections.  The desired amendments include: 
- the overhaul of electoral lists to reflect the true 
population created by voting bureaus in the district that the 
list represents, 
- publication of the electoral lists, 
- the reformation of the National Independent Election 
Commission (CENI) to include a parity of opposition and 
government members and a leader which is agreeable to both 
sides - currently 80 percent of the CENI are government 
members, 
- an amendment to the current election law to state that each 
party must receive a copy of the announced results as tallied 
by the CENI, 
- abandonment of the appointment of voting station assessors 
by the political parties in the contest, 
- and the free and equal access for all parties to public 
media such as radio, TV and newspapers. 
Without these issues being resolved the opposition does not 
believe that the elections can be anything but entrenched in 
massive fraud and incapable of producing a guaranteed honest 
and credible election. 
 
4. (SBU)  In conversation with Souleiman Farah Lodon, 
vice-president of Movement for Democratic Renewal (MRD), 27 
October Poloff learned that the opposition may entertain the 
notion of boycotting the election if their demands are not 
met.  However, Lodon noted that no decision would be made 
without the consent of all four parties. He continued that 
the opposition would use the same method for choosing a 
single candidate to represent them in the election.  Poloff 
then inquired about the September announcement of Djiboutian 
Party for Development (PDD) President Mohamed Daoud Chehem\'s 
intention to represent his own party in the race for 
President.  Lodon replied that Chehem rescinded his candidacy 
in a press statement on 18 October. He continued that the 
three other opposition party leaders had called Chehem to 
account for breaking agreements of the coalition by making a 
unilateral decision. Lodon commented that they then asked 
Chehem whether he would be in the coalition or whether his 
party would separate. Shortly after, Chehem released a 
statement indicating, according to Lodon, that he would 
rescind his candidacy. 
 
5. (U) Chehem\'s press statement reads as follows: \"Following 
the publication, in several international journals, of the 
announcement of my candidacy in the presidential election of 
2005, I have the honor of informing the other three parties 
of the Union for Democratic Alternance (UAD) that such a 
decision will be made only in conformity with the ways and 
customs of the Coordination, that is to say in a collegial 
manner. Consequently, I affirm that PDD remains still a party 
of the UAD. A division within itself will only profit the 
single party regime that mismanages the country.\" 
 
6. (C) Comment: Post has yet to verify whether Chehem has 
indeed withdrawn himself from the running. It is suspicious 
that Chehem\'s statement is phrased in such a way that it 
seems more like a clarification of support for coalition 
methods than a retraction. The process that Lodon described 
in which Chehem was told to make a decision between being in 
the coalition or not appears to have elements of coercion or 
intimidation to maintain a unified front. The candidacy, or 
non-candidacy, of Chehem does indicate that within the 
opposition there is a distinct difference in approach towards 
the election and a clear lack of coordination. End Comment.

VISIT TO DJIBOUTI 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Nigerian President Olesugun Obasanjo made a brief, 
unannounced visit to Djibouti 30 October while en route to 
Japan. The government run newspaper La Nation reported on 1 
November that during his time in Djibouti, Obasanjo met with 
President Ismail Omar Guelleh at the Djiboutian head of 
state\'s private residence.  According to La Nation the two 
Presidents discussed Somalia, Darfur, southern Sudan, and the 
request for African Union peacekeepers in Somalia. 
 
2. (U) On the issue of Somalia and the request for 
peacekeepers by newly elected President Abdillahi Youssouf, 
both Guelleh and Obasanjo reportedly expressed the desire to 
send their nations\' troops to Somalia as part of a contingent 
of peacekeepers.  Both also shared the same views regarding 
other support that might be needed by the new Somalian 
government.  La Nation commented that this was the same 
process carried out after the 2000 peace conference in Arta, 
Djibouti but the international community at that time did not 
follow up. 
 
3. (U) La Nation reported that the two presidents also 
discussed Darfur and North-South Sudan talks underway in 
Kenya. No details were provided but the upcoming United 
Nation Security Council (UNSC) meeting on Darfur to take 
place in Kenya, was noted. 
 
4. (C) Working level contacts in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs told Embassy Political Assistant several nominal 
details. The Obasanjo\'s visit was merely the length of his 
layover in Djibouti while waiting to fly to Japan. 
Originally, Guelleh was to meet Obasanjo in the VIP lounge at 
the airport but Guelleh requested discussions take place at 
his private residence not far from the airport. Sources also 
say the two Presidents discussed from where the funding for 
peacekeepers would come.  Regarding peacekeepers, the same 
source commented that since Ethiopia volunteered to send 
troops to Somalia, Djibouti would do the same. The general 
impression in Djibouti, as commented by one source, is that 
if one of the three countries on the frontlines with Somalia 
(Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti) is in, the other two will send 
troops. 
 
5. (U) Ambassador will seek more information from Ministry 
officials to elaborate on the topics discussed and 
corroborate information given by unofficial contacts at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTIAN OPPOSITION MEDIA THEMES, OCTOBER 27-28, 2004 
 
1. (U) Summary: The opposition journals during the week of 
October 24-28 focused on the alleged complaint against La 
Realite for slander filed by the Minister of Defense; the 
designation of the successor to Ahmed Dini Ahmed as president of 
the Republican Alliance for Democracy (ARD); and the 
distribution of school kits funded by United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID) in Djibouti. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) La Realite, published by the opposition party Republican 
Alliance for Democracy (ARD) reported October 27 that the 
Minister of Defense has lodged a complaint against the paper as 
a whole. The editor in Chief and his deputy were called to a 
hearing before the police for arguments. The story begins with 
an article published in the Realite one-week prior, October 20, 
concerning the Armed Forces inauguration of an air liaison 
linking Djibouti to the northern city of Obock. This liaison is 
meant to provide easier access to Obock, which is not easily 
reachable for common people. 
 
3. (U) The decision to establish a regular connection to Obock 
via military aircraft at the rate of USD 22.50 for a round trip 
was criticized by the opposition. The trip normally involves 
traveling overland a distance of 235 km by rough roads. The air 
liaison is direct and reduces the trip to 70 km. ARD denounced 
the action stating, \"Army intrusion into the private economy is 
the last thing that a citizen should expect from the military 
institution.\" The Minister of Defense, acting for the Army has 
introduced a legal procedure against the paper. Realite\'s report 
cites defamation as the charge but does not go into detail on 
the Minister\'s complaint. (Note: Embassy has not been able to 
reach contacts at the Ministry of Justice to verify or get 
further details of the Minister\'s charges against La Realite. 
End Note.) A trial date is not yet fixed. 
 
4. (U) La Realite reported 27 October that the opposition 
coalition, Union for Democratic Alliance (UAD) has finally 
designated a new president after the preceding Ahmed Dini in 
August. The current vice-president of UAD, Ismail Guedi Hared 
has been chosen to lead the coalition to the presidential 
elections of April 2005. 
 
5. (U) Le Renouveau, the newspaper issued by the Movement for 
Democratic Renewal (MRD) published two articles concerning the 
donation of school kits by the U.S government and the speech of 
the U.S Ambassador during the ceremony. The paper first reported 
that on October 21, the U.S Ambassador, \"has given 46,500 kits 
for students and 750 other kits for teachers and classes\". This 
donation was made under a USD 1.6 million program funded by 
USAID, but managed through UNICEF, said the article. The goal of 
this aid, as reported, is to assist the national education 
efforts and guarantee a better access to education by 
rehabilitating school infrastructures in rural and urban zones. 
The paper said: \"we came to know that an efficient distribution 
plan was set to ensure that materials go to their destination 
between 30 October and 3 November. The logistical support is 
jointly assured by the U.S military bureau for civil actions in 
Camp Lemonier and the Djibouti Armed Forces.\" Concerning the 
distribution, the paper continued, \"we\'re noticing here an 
effort for transparency by the American authorities that do not 
ignore the bad governance in place so they can ensure that 
materials arrive to their destinations.\" 
 
6. (U) The second article contained the speech by Ambassador 
Ragsdale printed in its entirety, which highlighted the honor of 
giving the supplies in the name of the U.S government to the 
Djiboutian Ministry of Education. Le Renouveau did not comment 
on the speech but highlighted Ambassador Ragsdale\'s remark that 
her government considers that every child has the right to 
receive a basic education and that the responsibility of 
ensuring that each child attends school is, in her opinion, the 
task of parents.\" The article also reported that the Ambassador 
affirmed that the U.S government has not only committed itself 
to raise the number of children that have access to education, 
but also to improve the quality of education.

SUBJECT: NEW SOMALIAN PRESIDENT SPEAKS ON CHALLENGES FACING 
TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Al Hayat a London based Arabic newspaper 
published 30 October an interview with the new President of 
Somalia. In the interview, widely read in Djibouti, he addressed 
several issues dealing with his return to Mogadishu, the 
disarmament process, terrorism in Somalia and the African Union 
military peacekeepers. He also touched on his hopes for relations 
with the United States of America, especially on the issue of 
counter-terrorism efforts. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) In an October 30th interview with the international Arabic 
paper Al Hayat, the newly elected president of Somalia, Abdillahi 
Youssouf Ahmed, reported that he will not to be able to go back 
to his country\'s capital for the time being. He commented that it 
would not be possible until peace and stability could prevail. 
Factors that could prevent that from happening are the wide 
spread presence of arms and munitions in the country. He 
mentioned some 55,000 armed militia personnel, 500 military 
vehicles and some 20 million weapons of different size exist in 
Somalia territory. The Somali president explained that for this 
reason, he needed international support to disarm militias and 
fight terrorism in Somalia. 
 
3. (U) On the issue of a possible terrorist presence in Somalia, 
Youssouf stated,\" There are numerous terrorist cells present in 
Somalia and this is caused by fourteen years of not having a 
government and we\'re trying to do whatever possible to track them 
down. When asked of the possibility of relations with the United 
States, he said\" I\'ll work with everyone helping with the 
reconstruction of Somalia and the establishment of peace in the 
country.\" He continued, \" We suffered the most from terrorism 
because terrorists are spread all over the country. We know that 
the United States is among the first nations that fought 
international terrorism. That\'s why I see no inconvenience for me 
and Americans to cooperate in eradicating this danger from our 
region and the world\". 
 
4. (U) As Al Hayat reported, Youssouf said that the challenges 
facing the new government are enormous and they cannot be 
resolved while living outside the country. He said he would not 
go to Mogadishu right away but it would be possible to start 
working from another region in Somalia. \"Somalia is not only 
Mogadishu\", he said. In response to whether he would use Puntland 
as an alternate site for the new government, he said:\" I can not 
move the government to my hometown. we\'ll choose another region 
within Somalia to begin the work\". Regarding the timeframe of the 
new government return to Somalia, Youssouf commented:\" I can not 
go to Somalia before I see the 30,000 peacekeeping forces I asked 
for from the African Union on the ground. I hope to see them in 
Somalia real soon\". 
 
5. (U) Regarding the topic of Somaliland and the future relations 
between the two nations, Youssouf stated\" We won\'t have a 
conflict with them nor ask them to join us by force. All we need 
is to choose the right time to engage in discussions to reach a 
peaceful solution.  I won\'t use violence even with those who 
opposed my election as president\". 
 
6. (U) Speaking on his relations with Arab world, he said\" I am 
going to Cairo at the beginning of the month to see the General 
secretary of the Arab League and present my propositions

negative views of the U.S. contribution.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) On October 21 and October 30, Ambassador and USAID 
Director joined Djiboutian officials and local UNICEF 
Director Thomas Davin, in the official unveiling and 
distribution of school kits provided by the Ministry of 
Education to primary school children in Djibouti under a 
USAID education grant of USD 1.6 million.  The distribution 
is part of a nationwide program in Djibouti that will see 
46,500 kits, containing exercise books, pencils, slate, 
eraser, pens, crayons, ruler and school bag, distributed to 
primary students in Djibouti\'s public school system.  The 
distribution will also include 750 instructor and classroom 
kits containing blackboard pens and other items for use by 
Djibouti\'s primary school teachers.

Government Support for Project 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) During the October 30 ceremony, both Prime Minister 
Dileita and Minister of Education Absieh thanked the 
Ambassador, USAID Director and the people of the U.S. for 
their support to education and economic development in 
Djibouti.  They expressed joy and satisfaction at the kits 
and extolled parents to send their children to school and 
extolled children to encourage their friends to come to 
school and remain in school.  For her part, the Ambassador 
stated that access to basic education is a right of every 
child.  She said she hoped the kits would help equip the 
students of Djibouti for their future this year, next year 
and for years to come. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Encouraging Education for All Youth 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The kits, designed to reduce the heavy burden on 
parents to purchase school materials for their children, are 
part of a campaign to encourage more of Djibouti\'s children 
of school age, especially girls, to enroll in school and 
remain in school. School fees have already been eliminated by 
the Government of Djibouti as part of its reform program and 
to encourage parents to send children to school.  School 
enrollment is currently at 53 percent overall in Djibouti, up 
from 39 percent in 1999 when education reforms began. Still, 
it is estimated that over 68,000 children of school age in 
Djibouti are not enrolling in local educational institutions. 
 
 
5. (U) USAID\'s support program for education reform also 
includes improvement in access to education through 
rehabilitation of city and rural school infrastructure, 
provision of school equipment, improvement in learning 
through training and in service training of teachers, 
supervisors and school inspectors.  It also includes 
development of a teachers\' handbook, establishment of teacher 
resource centers in each of the five provincial districts, 
encouragement of community support and participation in 
school maintenance, increased girls\' education and non-formal 
education activities. 
 
----------------------- 
Not Without Detractors 
----------------------- 
 
6. (U) In a surprisingly balanced October 24 article carried 
in the government newspaper La Nation, several parents were 
polled about their views on the efficacy of the kits.  Some 
expressed concern that the kits had arrived a bit late in the 
school year, and that most parents had already provided the 
essentials to their children.  Nevertheless, they stated, 
this donation should be continued in the future.  Others said 
the kits would permit them to save money in order to buy 
better clothes for their children or spend on other 
scholastic materials.  For others, the money might have been 
better spent on other items.  These included a first meal at 
school or, simply, daily milk, especially for students 
obliged to attend school on an empty stomach.  Still, other 
parents asked why the initiative of school kits was extended 
only to public primary schools.  They argued that private 
schools are not uniquely attended by rich students. 
 
7. (U) There were other parents who expressed the view in the 
La Nation article that they were not convinced of the 
practicality of the kit project and who said that they did 
not think the kits would permit much savings.  The costs, 
they said, were merely a \"drop in the ocean\" when compared 
with what was needed to educate a child.  Others doubted that 
the Ministry of Education could sustain such a project for 
the long term and questioned whether this year\'s donation was 
merely part of an electoral campaign. (Comment: President 
Guelleh runs for re-election in May, 2005.  End comment)  The 
article concluded by stating that it is \"access to education\" 
which in the end will enable Djibouti\'s students \"to fully 
integrate into the world of the new millennium and become 
responsible adults of tomorrow and future leaders of the 
country.\" 
 
------------------------ 
A Plan for Distribution 
------------------------ 
 
8. (U) The Ministry of Education\'s distribution plan for the 
school kits entails dissemination in the five provinces of 
the country between October 30 and November 3.  United States 
Military Civilian Affairs at Camp Lemonier and the Djiboutian 
National Army will jointly provide logistical support to 
regional governors (Commissars), school inspectors, and the 
community in this effort.

Committee (EAC) on 02 November, 2004 to review recent threat 
reporting from US Military sources.  The EAC discussed the 
potential of attacks on 
western targets and the addition of needed security measures 
to mitigate the threat.  Potential targets in Djibouti 
include the Embassy, the U.S. Military Base Camp Lemonier, 
and frequented establishments in the downtown area.  In

of HUMINT controlled sources, the EAC cannot reference a 
particular report at this time, but will immediately notify 
the Department as soon as a releasable report is published. 
On 11/02/2004, US Military sources received information 
indicating that a terrorist attack is being planned for 
execution within the next 48 hours against US Military and/or 
Coalition forces either in Djibouti and/or Ethiopia.  The 
source providing the information is still being vetted for 
credibility, but the information remains inconclusive and 
cannot be corroborated.  The methods, personnel, resources 
and operational planning is unknown at this time.  In light 
of coinciding events to include the Presidential elections, 
troop movements in the region, ongoing US Military operations 
in Iraq and the approaching end of Ramadan, the EAC believes 
that the possibility for such an attack is greater now than 
ever before.   Due to non-specific information and the 
questionable credibility of the source, the EAC has decided 
not to notify the American community of the threat until the 
information can be corroborated. 
 
3. (C) The EAC agreed that current physical security measures 
at the Embassy remain sufficient to deter or disrupt an 
attack.  In light of the general threat during the 
Presidential elections the Host Nation has increased its 
special Police presence around the Embassy during peak hours 
as an added security measure.  Mission personnel have been at 
a heightened level for a period of time and are carrying out 
appropriate personal security measures. Military 
representatives from Camp Lemonier are aware of the current 
threat and will take measures IAW their SOPs.  In addition, 
liberty has been restricted for the next 48 hours and joint 
US/Djiboutian Military patrols will be increased.  Coalition 
forces will be apprised of the threat  IAW National Security

For reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Ambassador met with Minister of Cooperation Mahamoud 
Ali Youssouf 3 November, at her request, to address several 
items.  Among them was a discussion on the nature of Nigerian 
President Olesugun Obasanjo\'s visit to Djibouti.  Youssouf 
confirmed reports in the local press (see reftel) that the 
visit was merely a refueling stopover for Obasanjo\'s aircraft 
and that discussion had focused primarily on Somalia.  He 
clarified that originally the arrangement was for Guelleh to 
meet Obasanjo in the VIP lounge at the airport, but Guelleh 
insisted that the two heads of state have discussions at his 
private residence.  Youssouf said that it was Guelleh\'s 
desire to discuss with Obasanjo details of the Darfur 
mediation, African Union peacekeepers to Somalia and 
prospects for international aid to Somalia.  These were 
relevant topics in the context of Obasanjo\'s AU role and the 
possible membership of Nigeria in the U.N. Security Council. 
He commented that the meeting between the two presidents had 
lasted less than one hour. 
 
2. (C) In response to Ambassador\'s question on whether 
Obasanjo had expressed his views on the likelihood of new 
Somalian President Abdillahi Yusuf being able to bring 
together the different factions, Youssouf commented only on 
the perspective of the Djiboutian government. He stated that 
President Guelleh thinks it will be very, very difficult for 
Yusuf to accomplish this task.  There are three big issues 
impeding Yusuf\'s success, he continued. First, he is known as 
a former military person, tough and inflexible. Second, he 
has been personally involved in the overall \"mess\" in 
Somalia.  Third, he is facing very serious problems with 
Somaliland, as evident by recent fighting between Puntland 
and Somalia that has claimed over 100 lives.  However, 
Youssouf commented, \"we think, given the situation and 
support of the international community, he seems to be moving 
in the right direction.\" 
 
3. (C) Youssouf then said the main question for Abdillahi 
Yusuf\'s new government was how to install itself in 
Mogadishu.  He said in order to do this Yusuf will need to 
make concessions to the Hawiye and Abgal, the clans that 
occupy the area around Mogadishu. Youssouf thought that this 
might mean appointment of an Abgal Prime Minister.  After 
concessions to the Hawiye and Abgal, Yusuf should then move 
towards pacifying the other factions, Youssouf said. 
However, he continued, \"this will be an impossible mission 
without African Union military support.\" Only after the 
factions were pacified will Yusuf be able to begin 
disarmament. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador commented that the process Youssouf 
described seemed a good one, but the question remains: Is 
Yusuf the one able to do it?  Youssouf made the comment that 
Djibouti was not initially behind Abdillahi Yusuf\'s candidacy 
but will support him because Djibouti needs peace and 
stability in Somalia. He continued that Somaliland\'s stance 
of non-cooperation was predictable because of the negative 
history between Yusuf and Somaliland. Yusuf was one of the 
officers in the army who moved to crush Somaliland resistance 
under Siad Barre.  Yet it is believed that Yusuf is the one 
needed to lead because he will be strong enough and have guts 
enough to handle a crisis decisively. Indeed, Youssouf 
commented, it is believed that Yusuf would be able 
successfully to crush any challenge to the new regime\'s 
authority. 
 
5. (C) Youssouf said the Government of Djibouti believes that 
Yusuf has already shown a willingness to make concessions. 
Yusuf had told the transitional parliament that it could 
select a Prime Minister either within or outside of 
parliament, as their choice.  He commented that Yusuf\'s main 
ambition was merely to come to office as President and once 
in office, be more flexible. He said Yusuf had made public 
plans to travel to Brussels, Cairo and New York. 
 
6. (C) Ambassador commented that the IGAD Executive Secretary 
preferred that Yusuf wait on planned visits to Brussels, 
Cairo and New York until he has a full government in place. 
Youssouf agreed that this was a wise course and said Yusuf, 
who Youssouf believed was now in Kenya, should have thought 
more thoroughly before going even to Ethiopia. He also stated 
that perhaps Yusuf was going quickly to visit international 
entities in order to gain legitimacy and financial support 
through their recognition of his status.

1. (U) Summary: Djibouti\'s delegation to the Safe Skies for 
Africa (SSFA) Conference in Johannesburg, South Africa, 
October 25-28 returned with effusive praise of their 
experience. Djiboutian aviation officials that attended 
included Technical Advisor to the Minister of 
Transportation, Mohamed Mahamoud, Chief of Air Traffic 
Control, Ibrahim Moussa, and Director General of Djibouti 
International Airport, David Hawker. Embassy Economic 
Assistant also attended. Djibouti\'s delegation was 
especially pleased by the official announcement of Djibouti 
as a member of the Safe Skies program. Henceforth, the 
Djiboutian aviation industry is now eligible to receive 
technical assistance and equipment under the SSFA program. 
Djibouti must now begin the agreements process with the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA) in order to benefit from the 
program.  End Summary 
 
 
2. (U) Djibouti\'s delegation to the October 25-28 Safe Skies 
for Africa (SSFA) Conference in Johannesburg showed 
continued interest in all subjects covered by SSFA program 
speakers during the conference. Government of Djibouti (GOD) 
officials were pleased with the opportunity to meet with 
SSFA authorities as well as participants from other 
countries in order to become familiar with the SSFA 
program. They were very impressed by the benefits obtained 
by other countries as a result of the SSFA program and hoped 
for the same in Djibouti. These advantages include secure 
airports, professionally trained staff, modern equipment, 
increased trade, and more routes for national airlines. They 
also noted the seriousness showed by countries like Kenya, 
Cape Verde and Uganda in implementing the SSFA program, and 
look forward to gaining similar experience. 
 
3. (U) SSFA officials told Djibouti\'s representatives at the 
Conference that during the course of the program, they would 
closely cooperate with the Ministry of Transportation, the 
Civil Aviation and the Airport. The Ministry of 
Transportation is responsible for implementing and 
coordinating government policy in road transportation, rail 
transportation, air transportation, sea transportation and 
weather forecast.  Like most ministries in Djibouti, the 
Ministry of Transportation lacks adequate financial and 
human resources. This lack of funding will probably make any 
commitment of resources from Djibouti difficult. 
 
4. (U) Djibouti\'s International Airport was contracted to 
Dubai Port International (DPI) for private management in 
June 2002. During that time DPI has acquired some equipment 
and trained several of its staff members. David Hawker, 
Director General of the Airport expressed the desire to 
integrate DPI training schedules with SSFA\'s training 
agenda.  SSFA indicated that it could provide training on 
the airport existing equipment if the equipment U.S. 
made. On the request for air navigation equipment made by 
Ibrahim Moussa, Air Traffic Control Chief, SSFA officials 
responded that funds are not sufficient to purchase them at 
this time but second hand equipment could be obtained and 
shipped at the expense of Djibouti International Airport if 
agreeable to the airport. 
 
5. (U) During bilateral talks with Djiboutian officials, DOT 
and DHS both stressed that they will offer technical 
assistance but it will be GOD responsibility to implement 
the program. In addition, strong support at ministerial or 
higher level is crucial for the success of the program. 
SSFA is committed to help Djibouti meet ICAO standards, 
promote airport security in the region to protect against 
terrorism, provide safe and secure passengers and cargo, and 
establish sound regional navigation and air traffic 
services, Djibouti\'s representatives were told. In addition, 
safe and secure travel is expected to lead to economic 
benefits. 
 
6. (U) Embassy briefed Almis Haid, Civil Aviation Director 
who, at the last minute could not attend. Haid said that 
SSFA program is a blessing for the Civil Aviation 
Department, which has been completely neglected for many 
years and does not play its proper supervisory role. The 
Civil Aviation Department has a very small staff and an 
insignificant operational budget. As for the National 
Airport Security Program, a draft completed by a French 
Consultant is available but has a lot of shortcomings 
according to Haid. This draft is currently being reviewed by 
the ICAO, which visited Djibouti last September to perform a 
safety audit of Djibouti\'s sole international airport. 
 
7. (U) The first step Djibouti needs to complete is the 
signing of a technical assistance agreement with the FAA. 
Then a SSFA team will visit Djibouti to complete a global 
initial survey, which will produce an individual roadmap of 
assistance to Djibouti under the SSFA program. SSFA 
officials stressed that all their tasks will be in 
consultation with the US Camp Lemonier in Djibouti in order 
to avoid activities that could put the security of the camp 
at risk. FAA will focus on safety and air navigation while 
TSA will deal with the security aspects. TSA will need to 
 
SIPDIS 
sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the GOD in 
order to run its activities in Djibouti. TSA handed a draft 
MOU to the Djiboutian delegation for its review. No comment 
has yet been provided by the Djiboutian government. 
 
8. (U) Comment: Since the airport is privately run 
government entity, post expects smooth follow-up and 
implementation of the SSFA program.  Hawker expressed 
confidence that SSFA and DPI could closely work together to 
enhance airport security and safety.  Post believes that 
actions from the Ministry of Transportation or the Civil 
Aviation are likely to be slow, primarily due to 
shortcomings in institutional organization and 
coordination.  However, we believe the political will and 
legislative support needed can be mustered.  Post hopes that 
strong desire and initial efforts shown by Djiboutian 
authorities at the Conference and immediately following will 
persist throughout the program. End Comment.

SUBJECT: DORALE TRANSMITTER GOES LIVE; NEGLIGIBLE 
INTERFERENCE WITH DORALE PORT 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: A medium wave transmitter at the Radio 
Television Djibouti (RTD) station in Dorale was activated on 
November 4, marking completion of phase one of the RTD- 
International Board of Broadcasters (IBB) joint renovation 
of the station. Concerns that the transmitter may interfere 
with cranes at the Port of Dorale have thus far been 
unfounded.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) On Thursday, Engineers activated the first of three 
to be installed by IBB at the RTD Dorale station. Another 
medium wave transmitter is scheduled for activation at the 
end of this year, and a short wave transmitter in the spring 
of 2005. 
 
3. (U) The $1.2 million renovation of the station and 
installation of the transmitters is part of a bilateral 
agreement between the Government of Djibouti (RTD) and IBB 
for the long-term lease and licensing of the PK-12 site used 
for Radio Sawa broadcasting. 
 
4. (U) There were some concerns that cranes at the new Port 
of Dorale, now under construction, would pick up energy from 
the transmitter, posing a potential danger to crane 
operators.  However, thus far tests have showed no/no-marked 
effect on the Port. 
 
5. (U) In a visit to the radio station on Thursday, Port 
representatives said they were unaffected by the transmitter 
but aware of the potential dangers. RTD has been and has 
said it will remain in regular contact with the Port about 
this issue, especially when the other two transmitters are 
activated. 
 
5. (U) Comment: As this is an RTD facility and not a USG 
facility, all parties are aware that any problems and 
incidents will be handled by RTD, with reports passed to IBB 
and post.

SUBJECT: PROGRESS CONTINUES AT DORALEH PORT 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Ambassador and Pol/Econoff visited the 
construction site of the new port facility at Doraleh on 
November 8 to track progress and obtain an update from the 
port\'s project manager K.K. Menon of Emirates National Oil 
Company (ENOC).  Ambassador\'s last visit had taken place in 
July.  Doraleh\'s construction schedule has remained, for the 
most part, on time and completion should be on schedule, 
according to Menon.  Menon and Ambassador discussed ENOC\'s 
contract with Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) for fuel 
tanks for use by the U.S. Navy, DESC tracking of port 
construction, and the assessment that DESC may be interested 
in leasing an additional four tanks to meet U.S. military 
needs.  Menon also noted progress made on the road connecting 
the new port of Doraleh to the city of Djibouti and the main 
route to Ethiopia.  The new port is still considered by 
Djibouti\'s government to be the country\'s gateway toward 
becoming a Dubai in the Horn of Africa region. End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Pylon Needs Have Changed 
------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The new port facility at Doraleh is coming along well. 
 Progress has been hampered slightly by difficulties with a 
soft sea floor and pylon construction.  Project Manager K.K. 
Menon of Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC) said in the 
initial survey of the sea terrain, the depth to reach hard 
earth on the sea\'s floor was 40 to 50 meters.  However, in 
some areas soil firm enough to construct pylons was not found 
until drilling to a depth of 60 to 70 meters.  Menon 
commented that this unexpected depth has caused the need for 
longer pylons, which have been found in Turkey.  Delays in 
completion of construction on time will hinge on whether 
these pylons will arrive on time.  The only other difficulty 
encountered in construction has been the constant need for 
Argon gas and the lack of a reliable shipping agent for the 
gas.  ENOC\'s solution to this problem is to create an Argon 
gas plant on site during construction, which would 
subsequently be dismantled when the new port comes on line. 
 
-------------------------- 
U.S. NAVY AS CUSTOMER 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Menon told Ambassador that a visit in October by a 
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Defense Energy Support 
Center (DESC) team evaluated progress on construction of the 
Phase I oil terminal at Doraleh, and specifically the four 
tanks to be leased by DESC for the U.S. Navy.  The team also 
made a final needs assessment for the contract.  Menon said 
that the team indicated there might be a requirement for an 
additional four oil tanks, making a total of eight.  Another 
topic discussed with the DLA/DESC team was the desired 
completion date.  According to Menon, DESC would like to 
start the contract two months early (April, 2005 vice a 
contract date of June, 2005) in order to facilitate a move 
from facilities in Yemen at the expiration of the Yemeni 
facility\'s contract.  Menon commented that ENOC would not 
commit to an early completion date but, still, is striving to 
meet that date. 
 
-------------------------------- 
GETTING LOCAL OIL COMPANY BUY-IN 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU)  The ongoing issue of oil companies Exxon-Mobil, 
Shell and Total being required by the government of Djibouti 
to move their operations to Doraleh was again raised as a 
topic of discussion. Menon informed Ambassador that the 
following day, November 9, the Director General of Djibouti\'s 
Exxon-Mobil office was to visit the port.  Menon did not 
indicate whether the intent of the visit was to enter into 
any discussion about leasing tanks or merely to get a closer 
look. However, he stated that ENOC was not pressuring 
companies to move because ENOC believes it would be 
beneficial for Djibouti to have an alternative source for 
oil.  In Menon\'s opinion, the government\'s demand is based on 
environmental reasons since tanks at the current port are 
extremely old and do not have the leak prevention mechanisms 
newer tanks have.  At Doraleh, he said, the tanks are being 
built with a system to monitor and detect any leaks that 
might happen.  Menon said this was unlikely because the tanks 
are constructed with computerized equipment that ensure even 
and thorough welding, and with a membrane beneath it to 
prevent leaks entering the ground soil. 
 
-------------------------- 
ETHIOPIA\'S VESTED INTEREST 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Rumors of Ethiopian involvement in ownership of 
Doraleh, or in the least contracting their own tanks at 
Doraleh, are now leaning towards the latter.  Menon told 
Ambassador that a delegation from Ethiopia\'s petroleum and 
trade ministries was to visit for three days later in the 
week.  Discussions have revealed that the Ethiopian 
government is serious, according to Menon, but the question 
of how long Ethiopia will take to commit remains. 
 
6. (U) Whether Ethiopia contracts tanks for its proprietary 
use or not, the road connecting Doraleh to the main truck 
route is an important factor.  Doraleh\'s construction 
includes rebuilding of the road to the city and creation of a 
connecting road to the existing truck route.  Construction 
started only recently but has been going smoothly and 
quickly.  Installation of fiberoptics underground for 
utilities wiring will also be part of the road construction 
project.  Menon was fully confident the roads would be 
completed on time and would not be an issue. 
 
-------------------------------- 
PERSONNEL RESOURCES AND DJIBOUTI 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) In terms of employment, Doraleh is still bringing in a 
large number of expatriate workers.  The total number is now 
around 620 persons, 30 percent of whom are Djiboutians.  Most 
of these Djiboutians are hired on a weekly basis in order to 
spread the few jobs available over a large number of people 
over time.  Menon said for the actual operation of the port, 
there will be a transition to permanent employees instead of 
rotating weekly workers.  Some will ultimately be hired from 
the rosters of Exxon-Mobil, Shell and Total local operations. 
 Other Djiboutians who fit the education requirements will be 
trained for six months to one year in Dubai and then begin 
their jobs at Doraleh.  Menon expected that there would 20 to 
30 Djiboutians trained in the first wave. 
 
----------- 
COMMENT 
----------- 
 
8. (C) The remaining planned phases of Doraleh port have yet 
to begin construction, although Menon indicated that work 
would commence in the next few months.  Phase 2, the 
container terminal, still is expected to be operational in 
September 2005.  A Phase 3 project remains in planning stages 
and a completion date has not been determined.  Moreover, 
ENOC plans now to reclaim part of the area attached to the 
causeway for use as additional port space. Both the port\'s 
principal local backer, businessman Abdurrahman Boreh, and 
the Government of Djibouti seriously view the Doraleh project 
as Djibouti\'s gateway toward becoming a Dubai in the Horn of 
Africa region.  Support from ENOC in this project -- and the 
commitment of the U.S. Navy -- have helped galvanize their 
sentiments.  End comment.

For reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (U) Summary:  Close to 19,000 people continue to be fed 
in Djibouti\'s three refugee camps.  The United Nations High 
Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Program 
(WFP) are coordinating efforts to assist with voluntary 
repatriation of refugees back to Somalia.  Their work is 
carried out through the Djiboutian National Office for

4.  (U) Between February and October this year, 7,575 
individuals turned in their ration cards and accepted 
resettlement packages.  Up to 1,200 additional refugees in 
Holl Holl and Ali Addeh have signed up for repatriation and 
are expected to turn in their ration cards by the end of 
2004. 
 
5.  (U) UNHCR and WFP observers verify that despite pressures 
from the Djiboutian Minister of the Interior to empty the 
camps, repatriation continues to be voluntary.  When a 
refugee signs up to return home, they are assigned to a 
convoy to be taken to Hargeisa.  At the time of departure, 
they turn in their ration cards and receive an assistance 
package, which includes a small amount of cash as well as 
nine months of staple foods. 
 
6.  (U) Since February, 13 convoys have departed Djibouti for 
Hargeisa  According to a local UNHCR representative, more 
frequent convoys are not possible because the resettlement 
programs in Hargeisa are struggling to absorb the inflow, 
which also includes refugees returning from camps in 
Ethiopia. Due to food crises in Ethiopia, emptying those 
camps has been a higher priority to WFP and UNHCR. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Repatriations to the rest of Somalia 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
7.  (U) The transit camp, Aour Aoussa harbors mostly refugees 
from Southern and Central Somalia.  A registration drive 
completed in early November counted 3,395 individuals living 
in Aour Aoussa.  ONARS oversaw the registration process, and 
simultaneously identified 1,342 candidates for voluntary 
repatriation. 
 
8.  (U) Such a high percentage of Aour Aoussa residents 
wanting to return home surprised organizers.  They are now 
grappling with the difficult logistics of the repatriation. 
The individuals come from all over Somalia and multiple 
repatriation destinations must be accommodated. 
Additionally, the mode of transportation is undecided.  One 
UNHCR representative informed ConOff that they are 
discouraging boat transport because of perceived difficulties 
in loading and unloading the available vessels.  However, 
they are balking at the quoted costs of using planes. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
The future of the refugee camps 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
9.  (U) Between 300 and 400 individuals in Holl Holl and Ali 
Addeh are not considered eligible candidates for 
repatriation.  These include refugees from the war between 
Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as Somali individuals awaiting 
visa petitions submitted by relatives in the U.S., Canada or 
the U.K. 
 
10.  (U) UNHCR and WFP hope to encourage all Somalilanders to 
return home by the end of 2006.  The plan then would be to 
move those individuals ineligible for repatriation together 
with anyone who chooses not to repatriate to Central or 
Southern Somalia into one refugee camp, and close the other 
two camps. 
 
11.  (SBU) Between February and October 2004, 7,575 
individuals turned in their ration cards and accepted 
resettlement packages.  However, according to local UNHCR 
representatives, only 20% of those that accepted the package 
actually crossed the border into Somalia.  It is unknown how 
many of the remaining 80% were actually bone fide refugees 
who have chosen to stay illegally in Djibouti, and how many 
were actually Djiboutian citizens who managed to get a ration 
card illicitly.  Some of those may have been staying in the 
camps, while many may have been dwelling and working 
elsewhere, coming to the camps only for the meals. 
 
12.  (C) Comment:  The high number of \"repatriation 
candidates\" that do not leave Djibouti is worrisome.  Most 
are suspected to be Djiboutian citizens that were simply 
getting free food.  The fraud is particularly egregious since 
most \"refugees\" have been collecting free meals for close to 
13 years.  However, whether they leave Djibouti or not, the 
number of individuals being fed through refugee aid money is 
decreasing, so involved parties seem to prefer not to 
acknowledge the issue. 
 
13.  (C) Local government officials may also be exerting 
quiet pressure to turn a blind eye to this practice, as it is 
in their interest to have their constituents fed.  ConOff was 
informed that any scheduled repatriations in early 2005 were 
likely to be postponed or canceled as repatriations will be 
an unpopular issue during the campaign season leading to 
elections in March. 
 
14.  (C) The Djiboutian Government has mandated that all 
refugee work by UNHCR, WFP, or any other similar organization 
must be coordinated locally through the National Office for 
Assistance to Refugees and Disaster Victims ONARS. 
Conversations with ONARS officials confirm post suspicions 
that they will have little to do and may lose their funding 
if the total number of refugees in Djibouti drops below 
5,000.  They recognize their vested interest in keeping the 
refugee numbers high.  While they seem to be cooperating for 
now, repatriations may find logistics becoming increasingly 
difficult throughout 2005 as the coordinators attempt to 
extend their employment. End comment.

SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION WEEK SHORT, BUT SWEET 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: This year\'s International Education Week 
(IEW) was successful, despite the fact that the Eid, paired 
with the Muslim work-week, shortened observance to three and 
a half days. Embassy-sponsored events included a soccer 
tournament, book donations, a lecture, art exhibitions, an 
Ambassadorial visit to a local school, and a lunch for 
children at the Ambassador\'s residence. The week\'s showcase 
was the school-to-school exchange project. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) Embassy Djibouti\'s participation in International 
Education Week (IEW) was a school exchange organized by the 
Public Diplomacy Officer. One hundred and fifty Djiboutian 
elementary/Middle School students from three schools drew 
pictures, wrote essays and created skits to express the 
theme \"A Day in My Life.\" Three Ohio schools were identified 
to do the same.  The projects will be packaged and mailed to 
their counterparts in each country.  Photos were taken at 
every event and will be burned to compact discs for each of 
the six participating schools (US and Djibouti), the 
Ministry of Education and the Embassy. 
 
3. (U) The Embassy provided beads, paint, macaroni and 
tissue paper to the Djiboutian schools that focused their 
IEW projects on art, due to a lack of English speakers. The 
Public Diplomacy Officer encouraged involvement by visiting 
the classrooms of participating schools over the course of 
November. 
 
4. (U) Other Embassy-sponsored events included a book 
donation to Middle School students, a panel about how to 
study in the U.S. for college students and a football 
tournament for high school students. The events were 
exceptionally successful exchanges that stressed not only 
the importance of education but also the bilateral 
relationship. Post was impressed by some of the sensitive 
themes explored by the students, including environmental 
pollution and female genital mutilation. Ideally, the 
relationship will continue between the US schools and the 
Djiboutian schools throughout the year with pen pal letters 
and other school-directed exchanges. 
 
5. (U) A breakdown of IEW events, with results, follows. 
Please note that all events were conducted in French, unless 
otherwise noted. 
 
On November 16: 
 
-- IEW officially opened with banners over all of the town\'s 
main entrances. The Public Diplomacy Officer visited each of 
the schools for a project exhibition and handed out t-shirts 
to every participating student and teacher with the 
Department\'s official IEW logo (translated into French), and 
the slogan \"Rapprocher les systems educatifs Djibouti-Etats- 
Unis D\'Amerique.\" The Public Diplomacy Officer also met with 
the Parent\'s Associations at some of the schools to discuss 
the importance of education. 
 
On November 17: 
 
-- Ambassador attended an exhibition and ceremony at Charles 
D. Foucault Middle School and, in conjunction with the 
Minster of Education, passed out t-shirts to participating 
students - who are part of an English class. She also passed 
out two books in English to each student, \"The Prince and 
the Pauper\" and \"Girls Who Rocked the World.\" (This is the 
school that did not receive a materials donation). The 
ceremony was covered by the local media. 
 
-- The Public Diplomacy Officer gave a radio interview on 
the importance and goals of International Education Week. 
 
-- The Public Diplomacy Section hosted a panel discussion at 
the local university titled, \"So You Want to Study in the 
US.\" The panel consisted of a short presentation by a 
representative from the International Foundation for 
Education and Self Help (IFESH) and was followed by a 
question and answer session. An IFESH teacher, the Djibouti 
IFESH coordinator, Embassy Djibouti\'s Consular Officer and 
Embassy Djibouti\'s TOEFL Administrator comprised the panel. 
About 75 people attended. 
 
On November 18: 
 
-- Twelve students, chosen by teachers from the 
participating classes for their high potential, attended a 
peanut butter and jelly and chocolate chip cookie lunch at 
the Ambassador\'s residence, followed by a tour of the 
residence and Embassy grounds by the Ambassador and the 
Public Diplomacy Officer. 
 
-- The visit was followed by a tour of an exhibition set-up 
in an Embassy conference room of all the student\'s IEW 
projects, so each could see the efforts of the other 
schools. 
 
-- The first round of an IEW girl\'s football tournament, 
organized by the Embassy for middle and high school aged 
girls, took place. Eleven teams, from both Djiboutian and 
French schools, took part and the number of spectators on 
the first night exceeded 200 people. Each participant 
received an IEW t-shirt (in different colors for each team). 
 
On November 19: 
* Tournament finals. The winning team in each division 
received a trophy donated by a local vendor. A third trophy 
was awarded for sportsmanship.

SUBJECT: EMBASSY DJIBOUTI REACHES OUT FOR RAMADAN 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Embassy Djibouti sponsored an information 
speech, several Iftaars (fast breakings) and a public 
service announcement during the Islamic Holy Month of 
Ramadan. Embassy staff also attended several Ifaars as part 
of its continued outreach to the country\'s Muslim community. 
END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) The Ambassador, Political Officer and U.S. Liaison 
Officer hosted Iftaars for women leaders, business leaders, 
political contacts and defense establishment contacts, 
respectively, during the Islamic Holy Month of Ramdan for 
2004. Each was well attended and well appreciated. They 
served as an excellent opportunity to bring contacts 
together from every section, as well as to introduce 
influential community members to many of the new staff at 
Embassy Djibouti. The inter-agency Women\'s Iftaar hosted by 
the Ambassador and spearheaded by the Pol/Econ Officer, was 
particularly well received and well attended by members of 
the government, parliament, private business, health and 
education sectors. Iftaar attendees often expressed their 
gratitude for the consideration the Embassy demonstrated by 
organizing events for Ramadan, and some were especially 
grateful that they were held in the private residences of 
Americans, as opposed to a reception area in town. 
 
3. (U) Djiboutians also reciprocated by hosting Iftaars to 
which member of the U.S. Embassy and Camp Lemonier were 
invited, among other guests. The Ambassador and CJTF-HOA 
Commander General Samuel Helland attended a particularly 
sumptuous Iftaar given by the Commander of Djiboutian 
Military Forces, General Fathi Ahmed Houssein. Other mission 
staff also benefited from invitation that extended from very 
simple to more elaborate affairs. 
 
3. (U) The Public Diplomacy Office placed a notice in the 
local newspapers in both French and Arabic wishing all 
Muslims a safe and productive Ramadan. Public Diplomacy also 
organized a \"Ramadan Information Speech\" for members of the 
Embassy and American military Community. The speech, 
attended by about 30 Americans, took place at the Embassy 
and was offered by a member of a moderate Islamic social 
service organization. The Embassy\'s effort to learn more 
about the most important month in this majority Muslim 
nation was well received by the mission staff, as well as by 
the social service organization, and the event had both 
educational and positive word-of-mouth public diplomacy 
benefits

SUBJECT: DPI CHAIRMAN PROPOSES U.S. MILITARY CONTROL OVER 
DJIBOUTI\'S AMBOULI AIRPORT 
 
REF: A. DJIBOUTI 1443 
     B. DJIBOUTI 1034 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) Summary:  Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Executive 
Chairman of Dubai Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation 
(the parent company to Dubai Ports International which 
manages Djibouti\'s existing maritime port and airport), has 
put forward a proposal that the U.S. military, based at Camp 
Lemonier, assume control in its entirety of Djibouti\'s sole 
airport at Ambouli.  In exchange for such control, the U.S. 
military would construct, at its own expense, a new civilian 
international airport that would support what Sulayem 
anticipates will be a growing tourism industry in Djibouti. 
Sulayem broached the proposal during a November 16 meeting, 
at his request, with Ambassador and Major General Samuel 
Helland, Commander of the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of 
Africa.  Sulayem said the expected influx of business and 
tourist travel through Ambouli airport might form a long-term 
security threat to Camp Lemonier, thus making more valuable 
U.S. control of the Ambouli facility as an airport 
exclusively for military use.  Sulayem\'s initial proposal did 
not include a clear role for France or its existing 
interests, preferring to leave the matter to the U.S. 
Sulayem\'s proposal is blessed by Djibouti\'s aggressive and 
key businessman Abdurrahman Boreh, who, with the Government 
of Djibouti and with Dubai Ports, Customs and Free Zone 
Corporation, are investing USD 120 million in construction of 
Djibouti\'s new shipping port, now under construction, at 
Doraleh.  It is not clear, however, if the proposal is 
blessed by Djibouti\'s President Guelleh. A meeting between 
Guelleh and Sulayem, that also would include Boreh, was 
scheduled for the same evening. There are important residual 
issues in Sulayem\'s proposition, such as presidential 
concurrence and our relationship with the French. There is 
also the nuts and bolts matter of cost and benefit to the 
U.S., which must ultimately drive the stance we take. End 
summary. 
 
2. (C) Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman of Dubai 
Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation (the parent company 
to Dubai Ports International which manages Djibouti\'s 
existing maritime port and airport), accompanied by 
Djiboutian businessman Abdurrahman Boreh and current General 
Director of DPI entities in Djibouti, David Hawker, met 
November 16 at the Embassy with Ambassador and Major General 
Samuel Helland, Commander of the Combined Joint Task Force 
Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA).  The meeting was at Sulayem\'s 
request, ostensibly to discuss the future of DPI in Djibouti 
and how its operations might affect Camp Lemonier, as well as 
the new Doraleh port now under construction (see reftels), in 
which Sulayem\'s company, the Government of Djibouti and Boreh 
are investing USD 120 million. Pol/Econ Officer sat in as 
notetaker. 
 
3. (C) Sulayem initiated discussions by making the point that 
Djibouti is in need of an updated international airport which 
could service an expected influx of business and tourist 
traffic once Djibouti\'s new Doraleh port comes on line.  He 
detailed the interest of Dubai Ports, Customs and Free Zone 
Corporation in investing in Djibouti through development of 
the country\'s tourism potential.  It would be his company\'s 
preference to cater to the high-end luxury tourist and 
business traveller, constructing hotels and recreation 
facilities for same. In Sulayem\'s view, natural growth 
stemming from traffic coming into and out of the Doraleh 
port, would significantly increase flight volume into and out 
of Djibouti.  This, in Sulayem\'s opinion, would not create an 
ideal security environment for Camp Lemonier, now based on 
the perimeter of Djibouti\'s existing single-runway civilian 
and military airport at Ambouli. 
 
4. (C) Sulayem said he believed the U.S. military would be in 
Djibouti for many years to come.  In addition, the U.S. Navy 
has contracted to lease at least four fuel storage tanks at 
the new Doraleh port, which will come on line between April 
and June of 2005.  Thus it is likely that Qatar, Kuwait and 
other Gulf countries would increasingly have less future 
appeal to the U.S. military for its security needs. He 
continued that Djibouti is ideal because of its strategic 
location, stable government and relative safety.  In such an 
environment, the military would naturally want to expand its 
base of operations and the logical location would be at the 
existing airport where it currently is billeted. 
 
5. (C)  Ambassador asked Sulayem what would he propose, in 
the scenario given, one do with  the French military, which 
also has basing facilities at the current airport?  She 
continued that Djibouti has already agreed in principle to 
grant France an additional 21 hectares at the current airport 
in order to help France meet its stated desire for added 
berthing and aircraft staging space. Sulayem responded that, 
unfortunately, \"France would have to be your problem.\" 
 
6. (C) Boreh interjected that he was aware of the agreement 
in principle in French, and appeared to confirm its 
existence.  He continued that this is why Djibouti so badly 
needs better coordination between its various sectors.  He 
said it was his intention to raise with President Guelleh, 
during a meeting he and Sulayem would have later that 
evening, the \"mixed signals\" Djibouti sometimes sends because 
of a lack of coordination. 
 
7. (C) Leaving aside the issue of France for the moment, 
Sulayem went on to say that it would be easier to move the 
civilian airport to a new location than to move the U.S. 
military base and expand the existing airport.  The 
Djiboutian military, which also uses the existing airport, 
would not be a problem because its fleet consists only of two 
helicopters and two fixed wing aircraft.  It could use the 
new airport.  Whoever took over the old airport should pay 
for construction of the new one, Sulayem said.  General 
Helland advised Sulayem that it was highly unlikely anyone in 
Washington would be convinced to pay for an entirely new 
airport.  Cost of construction, as well as the amount of 
money that would be needed to bring the existing airport up 
to standard would be prohibitive. 
 
8. (C) Sulayem and Boreh put the cost of a new airport at 
around USD 100 million.  They then put forward a series of 
alternative funding options, most of which were variations on 
ascribing cost for the U.S. military\'s base lease in 
Djibouti.  Boreh\'s first idea was to allocate specific funds 
from the cost of the base lease for construction of the new 
airport, which would be carried out by DPI and the Government 
of Djibouti.  Sulayem topped that idea with a suggestion that 
perhaps the base lease amount be waived altogether for a set 
number of years in return for funding of construction of a 
new airport.  The final option the two presented was a 
negotiated sale of the current airport to both the French and 
U.S. militaries and the proceeds used to help build a new 
airport.  This could give the U.S. all the land on one side 
of the runway and the French military all the land on the 
other side of the runway, including the existing terminal 
facility, Boreh suggested.  Ambassador and General Helland 
both expressed skepticism regarding the feasibility and 
financial practicality of Sulayem\'s proposition and its 
alternatives. 
 
9. (C) Comment:  We do not believe Sulayem and Boreh are in a 
position at the moment to offer or negotiate any of the deals 
they proposed in their meeting with Ambassador and CJTF-HOA 
Commander.  That said, they are to be taken seriously as 
interlocutors, given their fiscal and investment influence in 
Djibouti and their clout with President Guelleh.  Also, Boreh 
is an astute and serious businessman who is rarely deterred 
from a project he has set out to accomplish.  A new 
international airport for Djibouti remains very much on his 
radar.  The existing airport, with its single runway, is 
woefully inadequate for what he hopes to create for 
Djibouti\'s future. 
 
10. (C) Comment continued:  The pair may, for the moment, 
have the intention merely to plant ideas as the U.S. is in 
the midst of negotiations to renew its lease of Camp 
Lemonier.  There is no doubt that if the U.S. ultimately saw 
some value in the propositions-- or variants thereof -- 
Sulayem and Boreh could make it happen. However, there are 
important residual issues such as concurrence of President 
Guelleh, our relationship with the French, and implications 
for French interests here, in whatever we choose to do. 
There is also the nuts and bolts matter of cost and benefit 
to the U.S., which must ultimately drive our stance in 
Djibouti and which currently appears quite weak .  End 
comment. 
 
11. (U) General Helland has cleared this message.

1. (U) Embassy point of contact for Annual Terrorism Report 
is Pol/Econ Officer Erinn Reed (reedec@state.gov). Below is 
post changes to 2003 Country Section for Djibouti. 
 
2. (U) Djibouti, a staunch supporter in the global war on 
terrorism and a member of the Arab League, has taken a strong 
stand against international terrorist organizations and 
individuals. Djibouti hosts the only U.S. military base in 
Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to U.S. forces, it hosts 
Coalition forces from several countries on a rotating basis 
including France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Britain. There 
were no confirmed acts of domestic or transnational terrorism 
in Djibouti in 2004, but the Government took extraordinary 
measures from its limited resources to try and ensure the 
safety and security of Westerners posted in Djibouti. The 
Government received several million dollars during 2004 in 
training and assistance through the East African 
Counter-Terrorism Initiative to aid in its efforts to train 
security forces, secure borders and increase its capacity for 
maritime interdiction. Djibouti also joined the ranks of 
countries participating in the Safe Skies for Africa program 
in late 2004. Through this program, Djibouti is scheduled to 
receive funding to improve its airport security and 
infrastructure. The Government has also closed down terrorist 
linked financial institutions and shared security information 
on possible terrorist activity in the region. The 
counterterrorism committee under President Guelleh moved to 
enhance coordination and action on information concerning 
terrorist organizations. 
 
3. (U) In October 2002, the United States established the 
Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA). Based 
in Djibouti, CJTF-HOA coordinates Coalition anti-terrorism 
operations in six East African countries and Yemen. 
 
4. (U) Djibouti is party to three of the 12 international 
conventions and protocols relating to terrorism and signed 
the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of 
Terrorism on 15 November 2001.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI EXPRESSES INTEREST IN ANGLICIZATION 
 
1.  (U) Djibouti is an isolated francophone country, 
surrounded by countries where the official languages all 
include English.  The recent presence of the U.S. military 
in Djibouti has underscored a language barrier.  After the 
Government of Djibouti, the U.S. Government is the second 
largest employer.  Numerous conversations with Djiboutian 
citizens at all levels indicate an interest in \"anglicizing\" 
the country. 
 
2.  (U) Among Djiboutian youth, there is a growing 
recognition of the value of speaking English.  Job 
opportunities are limited in Djibouti with unemployment 
estimated to exceed 50%.  A command of English increases 
opportunities abroad for educated individuals and for 
professional positions with entities such as the U.S. 
Embassy.  Even the uneducated find that English gives them 
an advantage applying for jobs created by the U.S.  military 
at Camp Lemonier. 
 
3.  (U) English language clubs (for Djiboutians to practice 
English) at the university and high schools frequently ask 
the American Embassy for assistance with materials, money, 
time, and ideas.  During International Education Week, about 
75 students and teachers came to a joint presentation at the 
university by the Embassy and International Foundation for 
Education and Self-Help (IFESH).  The turnout was 
surprisingly large given that the students and teachers had 
been striking and most classes had not been in session for 
over a week. 
 
4.  (U) In addition, Mohamed Ali Hassan, Director of 
Bilateral Relations at the Ministry of Foreign Relations 
expressed to ConOff during a courtesy call a strong desire 
for more English language ability in the Djiboutian 
government.  He bemoaned the lack of language skills among 
his peers, stating that it hampers bilateral relations.  Mr. 
Hassan benefited from an International Visitor Program to 
the U.S., and talked about his experience enthusiastically, 
expressing hope that his colleagues in the Djiboutian 
government can experience the program as well. 
 
5.  (SBU) Comment: Djibouti is reaching out to its 
neighbors, attempting to increase trade opportunities in 
East Africa and the Middle East.  With funding from the 
United Arab Emirates, the Government is building a new 
deepwater port to position itself as a center of trade. 
Djibouti is a member of the Arab league.  While French is 
more commonly spoken in government, Arabic is also an 
official language in Djibouti.  Anglicization would open 
more opportunities within Africa, and reduce dependence on 
their Middle Eastern neighbors.  It is in U.S. interests to 
continue to encourage the interest in Anglicization and to 
assist Djibouti to develop English language capability. 
Embassy will work with the Department to explore 
opportunities to encouraged English language development in 
Djibouti.  End comment.

solution. He posed the question whether it would be wise to 
encourage Sudan to pursue a good path or to continue 
condemning it. Bogoreh said Djibouti would wait to see how 
the vote on the procedural motion went, then decide on the 
EU\'s resolution. He added Djibouti was in a delicate 
situation because Sudan is a friend and partner in IGAD. 
Bogoreh said that Djibouti should be very discreet when 
taking actions. Pol/Econ countered that the intent of the 
request for support on the EU resolution was to reinforce the 
message given by the Security Council and show the 
international community was fully committed to supporting the 
establishment of peace and stability in Sudan. Bogoreh 
replied that peace is essential to Sudan, human rights as 
well, but Djibouti would wait and see on the resolution.

SUBJECT: VISIT OF SOMALI PRESIDENT TO DJIBOUTI 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Summary: Newly elected President of Somalia, Abdillahi 
Youssouf Ahmed, came to Djibouti for a 24-hour visit on 
November 15, 2004. In a press conference with Djiboutian 
national media during the visit, Abdillahi Youssouf touched 
on the conflicting relations between Somaliland and Puntland, 
how he intends to manage the integration of Somaliland into 
the new federal entity of Somalia, and his three-phase plan 
to restore stability to war-torn Somalia. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) At the end of a 24-hour visit to Djibouti, new Somali 
President Abdillahi Youssouf Ahmed gave a press conference to 
Djiboutian national media. In the conference he explained his 
three-phase plan to return stability to Somalia: (i) 
disarmament, (ii) army building, and (iii) reconstruction of 
the country. Youssouf said he needed a foreign army to help 
rebuild Somalia\'s national military. His objective was not to 
put Somalia\'s population face-to-face with foreign forces. 
Rather, in order that these forces be accepted in Somalia, a 
Somali-speaking corps should guide them. He stated that 
Djibouti is closer to Somalia, and added that \"we need them 
on our side in this mission.\" Responding to a question 
concerning what he expected from the UN Security Council 
(UNSC) meeting in Nairobi on November 18 to discuss Sudan and 
Somalia issues, he stated that the UNSC should give financial 
support to an African force, because the African Union is 
still too young to do so effectively. Youssouf reported that 
he will present his program to members of the UNSC and will 
count on the UNSC to mobilize the necessary funds. Concerning 
a question on what the former transitional government, 
created at the Arta conference in 2000, has done and whether 
his cabinet will take the same path, the Somali president 
refused to criticize the former transitional government and 
said he would not repeat the same errors. Instead, he 
highlighted the importance of reconciling people and 
disarmament, two things the former government failed to do. 
He gave himself one year to fulfill these engagements. 
 
3. (U) On Somaliland-Puntland relations, Youssouf said the 
current state of relations does not please him. \"I used to be 
President of Puntland, now I am President of Federal Republic 
of Somalia and my duties are to observe the laws.\" He added 
that the conflict will only be solved by dialogue. On the 
issue of integrating the two self-proclaimed independent 
regions of Somaliland and Puntland, the Somali president 
stated that as soon as he is settled in Somalia, he would 
engage in negotiations with Somaliland. He said he believed 
Somaliland would eventually join the federation. 
 
4. (C) Comment: Sources said that the two presidents 
disagreed on the priorities of sending peacekeeping forces. 
Youssouf reportedly sought the support of Guelleh in his call 
for the international community to send forces to Somalia. 
Guelleh is said to have advised Youssouf that the priority 
was disarmament, not sending troops. He said the Somali 
warlords had to surrender their arms first, then African 
forces could come to Somalia. Guelleh also reportedly said 
that since many of the warlords are now parliamentarians, it 
would be likely that they supported the government. In 
addition, he highlighted the contradiction in having warlords 
in the government while still keeping heavily armed militias 
in Somalia. End Comment.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI: TRANSPARENCY OF BUDGETS/MILITARY SPENDING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 239929 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
A. General Overview of Auditing Procedures: 
 
1. (U) Expenditures by the Djiboutian military are audited on 
a yearly basis by the Chambre des Comptes (the Public 
Accounts Auditing Board).  The audit is limited to accounting 
books and other financial documents. Audits of military 
budgets are reported only to the President of the Republic, 
who is also the Supreme Commander of the military forces. 
The President is the only civilian authority that receives 
the audit of military expenditures. 
 
2. (U) A standard procedure for conducting annual audits 
exists, though it is not mandated by government policy or 
legislation. Judges from the Chambres des Comptes work with 
the Administration and Finance Direction of the Armed Forces, 
Gendarmerie, and the police in reviewing the accounting 
books. No audit is done on military bank accounts of petty 
cash funds. The Republican Guard\'s budget comes directly from 
the Presidency and is not audited. 
 
3. (U) The Minister of Finance is responsible for settling 
the military budget. The President finalizes the military 
budget with the advice of his Chief of Defense. All 
expenditures are co-signed by the Minister of Finance and the 
President\'s Chief of Defense. However he has little power to 
verify what funds in the military budget are spent on since 
the army budget is a discretionary power of the President. 
 
4. (C) Comment: It is generally understood that the 
government is unwilling to be transparent in the creation and 
use of military budgets for what it describes as security 
reasons. The capacity to audit the military expenditures does 
exist within the framework of the Chambres des Comptes. 
However, due to the sensitive nature of military affairs in 
Djibouti, the annual review seems to be more a theoretical 
verification than an actual audit. 
 
B. The Military Budget and On-Budget and Off-Budget Revenues 
and Expenses: 
 
5. (U) The military budget for 2004 totals 5.5 billion DF (30 
million USD) and provides for the Armed Forces and the 
Gendarmerie.  The National Police Force is funded from the 
budget for the Ministry of Interior. Off-budget receipts are 
not significant and are not audited. 
 
C. The Military Component of the National Budget: 
 
6. (U) The military budget makes up 19.5 percent of the total 
government budget. The military budget is second largest 
portion of the total state budget. Education comprises the 
largest portion of the state budget. Due to the large budget 
given to the military, political leaders turn to the armed 
forces to back public services, such as emergency medical 
services, air transport of civilians without access to the 
capital, and high-speed military boats used for medical 
evacuations from the northern regions. 
 
7. (U) The National Assembly devotes one of its two yearly 
sessions entirely to budgetary concerns.  Debates on budget 
priorities are televised nationally. However, input from the 
Parliamentarians is rarely taken into consideration.

SUBJECT: FRENCH CONSUL DJIBOUTI WANTS TO EMULATE U.S. VISA 
ADJUDICATIONS PROCESS 
 
Classified By: Andrea K. Lewis, Vice Consul 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (c) 
 
1. (U) Summary.  The French consul in Djibouti is very 
interested in the process by which AmEmbassy Djibouti 
adjudicates visas.  The Consul states that the American 
process appears more selective.  The French consulate is 
changing the adjudications process in Djibouti for Schengen 
(European Union) visas to emulate the American process.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (U) ConOff paid a courtesy call on the French consul in 
Djibouti, Marthe Meyrand.  Meyrand received ConOff warmly, 
asking lots of questions about American embassy methods for 
processing visa applications.  Meyrand is new in Djibouti, 
stating she has been in country about four months.  She said 
she wanted to revamp the process of adjudicating visas at the 
French consulate.  She stated she was less concerned about 
the danger of admitting potential terrorists, but would like 
to mitigate illegal immigration.  She was moderately familiar 
with section 214(b) of U.S. law, assuming all visa 
Non-Immigrant Visa applicants to be intending immigrants 
unless adjudicating officer is convinced otherwise. She 
stated that she wished French law made the same assumption. 
 
3.  (U) ConOff was given a full tour of the French Consular 
office and introduced to all its members.  One difference 
noted was that the French do not employ local staff in the 
consular section, as does the American Embassy; all employees 
are French citizens or dual nationals. 
 
4.  (U) Meyrand also asked about visa interviews.  ConOff 
informed her that all applicants except certain exempt 
diplomats were required to appear in person for interviews. 
She seemed pleased by this response and informed that she had 
also recently implemented an interview policy for Schengen 
(European Union) visas issued in Djibouti. 
 
5.  (SBU) Comment: When the French interview policy was 
implemented, it was not widely publicized, and ConOff heard 
from sources that local people were caught off guard.  Some 
anger was expressed; many Djiboutians consider it a right to 
go to France because of the historical colonization by the 
French, and the ongoing close ties between the countries 
since Djiboutian independence in 1977.  Prior to the new 
interview system, individuals could drop their paperwork with 
the French Consul and pick up their visa three business days 
later.  The interview system has been viewed as a statement 
of lack of trust.  End comment. 
 
6.  (U) Meyrand also asked about the U.S. Embassy\'s 
appointments system for visa interviews.  Due to low volume, 
AmEmbassy Djibouti does not require appointments, but takes 
walk-ins on specified days.  This information is publicly 
available in Djibouti.  Meyrand stated that a walk-in system 
would not work due to the significantly higher demand in 
Djibouti for French (now Schengen) visas than for American 
visas. 
 
7.  (SBU) Meyrand also raised the issue of name checks. 
ConOff was vague with answers, stating only that we do check 
applicant names with Washington.  Meyrand expressed 
frustration with the name check system available to her, 
stating that while it checked names across all Schengen visa 
countries, returned hits did not provide any useful detail 
either about the individual in question or their offense. 
 
8.  (C) While Meyrand asked many questions, she also offered 
information about the French Consular system.  ConOff was 
guarded with answers, and conscious of security issues. 
Meyrand was satisfied with vague answers and appeared pleased 
to accept publicly available information.  She told ConOff 
that she is trying to model the French adjudication process 
after the American process.  She stated that the U.S. seems 
far more selective in granting visas, and she would like to 
emulate that selectivity in granting Schengens in Djibouti by 
implementing as many of our processes as feasible into their 
system. 
 
9.  (C) Comment:  ConOff was surprised by the level of 
implied autonomy exercised by the French Consul in Djibouti 
to redefine the visa adjudications process.  Whether this 
autonomy exists in all French embassies is unknown.  Also 
surprising about the level of autonomy is that such decisions 
affect more than just France.  Schengen visas allow bearers 
to enter any European Union country.  Changing the 
adjudications process could affect all E.U. countries.  End 
comment.

SUBJECT: SWITCH IN BUTANE GAS SUPPLIER GIVES ENOC EXCLUSIVE 
ACCESS TO DJIBOUTIAN MARKET 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) The Government of Djibouti recently decided to switch 
providers of Butane cooking gas from a Yemeni company to 
Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC). The offer of a lower 
price for Butane gas is in contrast to the trend in global 
markets, where prices have gone up recently. However, the new 
deal is not only beneficial to the Government of Djibouti. 
With control over Djibouti\'s supply of Butane, ENOC now has 
an exclusive hold on providing hydrocarbons to Djibouti. The 
three other oil company\'s present in Djibouti (Shell, 
ExxonMobil and Total) have reportedly been informed of the 
decision, but negotiations are said to be ongoing in this 
matter. 
 
2. (U) The switch from the Yemeni company, which has 
subcontracted the rights to butane filling for Djibouti from 
Djiboutian businessman, Abdourahman Boreh\'s company, SOMPEC, 
for the past six years, to ENOC caused a two week gap in the 
supply chain of Butane. The shortage caused difficulties for 
hospitals, hotels, restaurants, and the expatriate community. 
The average Djiboutian family cannot afford Butane gas, but 
relies heavily on liquid gas at a fraction of the price. The 
Butane shortage nearly doubled the price of liquid gas for 
Djiboutian families. The two week shortage elicited no price 
controls or explanations from the Government. 
 
3. (C) Comment: The shortage in cooking gas and the resulting 
rise in price of liquid gas raise interesting questions 
regarding the government\'s attitude towards price regulation 
of gas. Djibouti has seen an unprecedented increase in fuel 
costs in the past two years, prompting the Government to 
issue promises to mitigate the effect of soaring 
international prices. However, as evidenced in this recent 
shortage and hikes in petrol prices this year, this is not 
always the case. The question remains whether the Government 
still stands behind the International Association of 
Hydrocarbons of Djibouti, the government entity responsible 
for regulating oil prices on the local market. The slow 
takeover of the Djiboutian oil and gas market by ENOC is also 
an issue that raises many unanswered questions, especially 
now that it seems to be receiving a monopoly from the 
government. Whether these moves towards ENOC will edge out 
competition and effectively close the market to free 
enterprise is one of the unknowns that could have a large 
impact on Djibouti\'s ability to attract investors. End 
Comment.

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
 
REF: DJIBOUTI 1377 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Summary: Two parties within the ruling coalition held 
congresses to select their presidential candidate and 
formulate plans for the elections scheduled for April 2005. 
The Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) 
held an ordinary session of the National Council on 24 
November. In meetings presided over by party president Ali 
Mohamed Daoud, the party members unanimously chose Ismail 
Omar Guelleh as their candidate. The Popular Social 
Democratic Party (PPDS) held its congress 25 November and 
also nominated Guelleh as their candidate for the 
presidential race. The four ruling coalition parties which 
comprise the Union for Popular Majority (UMP) have now all 
endorsed or nominated Guelleh as their candidate, making 
Guelleh the official UMP candidate. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The FRUD congress held 24 November unanimously 
selected President Ismail Omar Guelleh as the party\'s 
candidate for the presidential election scheduled for April 
2005. The president of FRUD, Ali Mohamed Daoud, stated that 
the last ten years of partnership with the ruling party, 
Popular Rally for Progress (RPP), have been overall very 
satisfying. However, Daoud did comment that despite the 
numerous promises fulfilled from the last presidential 
campaign, there were still points agreed upon in the peace 
accords from 1995 that have not been accomplished. Daoud 
specifically mentioned poverty, youth unemployment, social 
justice, and rural development as areas with unmet needs. 
(Note: FRUD was once the political faction of the rebellious 
movement of the same name that began the civil war in the 
early 1990\'s. The armed faction of FRUD is now known as the 
opposition party Alliance of Republican Democracy (ARD), the 
party of late Ahmed Dini Ahmed. End Note.) 
 
3. (U) The PPSD congress held 25 November also selected 
Guelleh as candidate and focused on the party\'s path for the 
future. The congress was led by party leader, Moumin Bahdon 
Farah, who emphasized the need for party members to enhance 
democracy within the party through participation in the 
functioning of the party by making monetary contributions to 
increase its budget. The PPSD celebrated its second 
anniversary as an official political party this year. Farah 
also asked party members to show commitment to party ideals 
like social welfare, the fight against poverty, and 
assistance to more vulnerable portions of the population. The 
PPSD approved Guelleh\'s economic and social program for the 
coming election and expressed their belief that the Doraleh 
project will contribute to a better life for all Djiboutians. 
 
4. (C) Comment: The Journal Officiel published September 15th 
announced the promotion of 14 military officers. However, 
according to sources within the Djiboutian military 
headquarters these 14 persons were not previously enlisted in 
the army. The source suspects that the promotions were given 
to members of the private militia of Aden Robleh Awaleh, 
president of the National Democratic Party (PND). Reportedly, 
when PND joined the ruling coalition UMP, Guelleh and Awaleh 
struck a deal to integrate and promote members of Awaleh\'s 
militia after attending the Hol Hol military academy. The 
decree granting the 14 promotions was not issued from the 
headquarters of the Djiboutian Armed Forces (FAD) and sources 
suspect that the decree came from the Military Cabinet of the 
Presidency. 
 
5. (C) Comment continued: Rumors are floating around town 
that the president and vice-president of PPSD have been given 
new SUV\'s by the government. Speculation on the reason for 
this gift points to the government sweetening the deal to 
keep the party in the coalition. This theory has some merit 
as both the president and vice-president of PPSD were said to 
be very upset by Guelleh\'s statements at the RPP congress in 
October (see reftel). End Comment.

SUBJECT: MASSIVE TRASH CLEAN UP CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED BY 
DJIBOUTIAN GOVERNMENT 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Summary: The Government of Djibouti has taken the 
first of many small steps to clean up Djibouti in launching a 
contest for the best \"Act and Keep Your City Clean\" poster. 
The contest opened for registration November 6th to 11th for 
children between the ages of 10 and 20.  The contest 
participants have a period of three days in which to submit 
their entries between November 27th to 30th. Pol/Econ met 
November 17th with the Director of the Technical Service of 
Djibouti, \"the Voirie,\" Djaffar Guedi, to find out more about 
the recent media focus on the trash problem and how the 
Voirie plans to solve it. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) For Djibouti, trash is a problem endemic to every 
region of the country, but most especially the capital city. 
Empty lots and shoulders of almost every road in the city 
quickly become the neighborhood dump. The prevalent attitude 
in Djibouti is \"beyond my wall is not my problem.\"  The 
government\'s lack of resources to effectively enforce 
littering laws in recent years has reinforced the public\'s 
apathetic view towards the trash problem and has made it 
acceptable to dump trash in any available spot. The sewage 
system in Djibouti is for all intents and purposes 
non-existent. The pipes that are in working order feed 
directly into the ocean not more than a mile from the nearest 
public beach.  Several of the more popular beaches in 
Djibouti are now abandoned because of the pollution. These 
sewer outlets have become popular places to dump household 
trash and even the neighborhood toilet.  Sewer backups 
frequently create puddles with an indescribable stench all 
over the city which remain until the sun dries them out. The 
potential for health hazards from the trash and sewage 
problems are numerous, including being breeding grounds for 
malaria carrying mosquitoes. 
 
3. (U) The Technical Service of Djibouti, known as the Voirie 
in French, is responsible for the maintenance and cleaning of 
the city. It is now their task to educate the Djiboutian 
people about the laws pertaining to proper trash disposal, 
fines for littering, and the potential economic and health 
risks that come with a city riddled with illegal trash dumps. 
The Director of the Voirie, Djaffar Guedi commented to 
Pol/Econ that the problem had to be attacked very slowly and 
continuously in order to make any progress. The campaign 
started this month shows that mentality. Since the campaign 
began, the government run newspaper La Nation has devoted 
space to the announcement of the poster contest. It has also 
carried the proclamation of the current trash disposal law, 
the proclamation of all trash regulations and a statement by 
the Voirie informing the public that surveillance teams will 
begin monitoring trash disposal in all neighborhoods and 
fines will be levied. According to Guedi, the Voirie is 
planning to air the same announcements on the radio to reach 
the illiterate population. La Nation also ran several 
articles and editorials prior to the campaign regarding the 
state of neglect the city is in, citing the citizens of 
Djibouti as the primary cause of the problem. 
 
4. (U) Guedi explained the thought process behind the poster 
contest and media awareness campaign as trying to get 
Djiboutian citizens to first realize that it is their own 
responsibility to keep the city clean.  He said once the 
population is fully aware that there are laws regulating the 
disposal of trash, the Voirie will start enforcing them. 
Guedi indicated that the Voirie\'s initial plan was to 
institute a 5,000 DF (roughly 30 USD) fine for each littering 
offense. Considering the average Djiboutian household makes 
around 1,200 USD annually, the fine is almost excessively 
steep.  Guedi responded to Pol/Econ\'s shock at the amount by 
saying if someone has to pay once, they\'ll never litter again 
to avoid paying twice. 
 
5. (U) Guedi stated that the entire campaign would start with 
the poster contest to make people aware, followed with a 
campaign to get people to use proper trash bags, enforcement 
of disposal laws, removing illegal street vendors, reducing 
the stray animal population, and continued regular trash 
pick-ups.  Pol/Econ inquired who would be responsible for 
picking up the trash that already infests the streets of 
Djibouti. Guedi replied each Friday, the Voirie conducts 
clean up operations in a different sector of the city. The 
Voirie supplies rakes, shovels and trucks to haul the trash 
away but works in coordination with community associations 
for manpower. Guedi commented that so far, more women were 
participating in the clean up days than men. 
 
6. (C) Guedi cited a major problem in the campaign as being 
the lack of adequate disposal facilities.  He commented that 
already the official city dump in Balbala was closed due to 
overfill and the city dump at Douda would soon reach 
capacity. Pol/Econ inquired as to why the Voirie was not 
using the incinerator donated by Camp Lemonier to mitigate 
some of the disposal problem.  Guedi replied that the 
\"incinerator\" was more of a large cooking pot and was not 
capable of handling the loads of trash produced by the city\'s 
several hundred thousand residents. He continued that the 
incinerator given by the camp could only be used for one type 
of trash, like wood, and that it was impossible to sort as 
much trash as the city threw away. (Note: The incinerator 
given by CJTF-HOA to the Government of Djibouti was intended 
to be a tool to help manage the trash problem, not solve it 
entirely in one go. Civil affairs teams at Camp Lemonier 
reportedly made exhaustive efforts to train the Djiboutian 
sanitation workers. However, training sessions were 
repeatedly missed by the Djiboutians, rescheduled and missed 
again. Information from the manufacturer of the incinerator 
indicate that it is not meant strictly for wood, but burned 
wood and other paper products as a source of energy. This is 
meant to aid its use in areas where oil and gas supplies can 
be inconsistent or expensive. The manufacturer did say the 
incinerator required the trash burned to be sorted by type 
and that some items, by nature, would not be able to be 
destroyed by fire. End Note.) 
 
7. (C) Guedi said that Camp Lemonier had requested the 
Government of Djibouti move Douda dump to a different 
location. (Note: Conversations with Camp officials indicate 
that a request to physically move the dump was not made. 
However, in current lease negotiations there is a requested 
provision to the lease to mandate that no trash is burned 
within 15 nautical miles of the Camp\'s boundaries to prevent 
the sometimes noxious smoke that blows into Camp Lemonier. 
End Note.) He continued that studies would have to be done to 
find an adequate area. Guedi then asked whether the U.S. 
Embassy or USAID would be able to assist the Voirie in the 
analysis of new sites for landfills. Pol/Econ said she did 
not know which agency is better placed to address such 
proposals. Pol/Econ continued that if the Voirie sent a 
detailed proposal to the Embassy, both agencies could review 
it and see if any resources could be found to help. 
 
8. (U) Pol/Econ also suggested that if the government was 
really serious about changing the mentality of the population 
it would have to set an example. She cited a project 
currently in the planning stages between Embassy\'s Public 
Affairs section and the City of Tadjourah for a Clean Up 
Tadjourah Day. The project was initiated by a civic 
association in Tadjourah who submitted a grant request for 
assistance from the Embassy. Pol/Econ suggested that perhaps 
Djibouti City could organize something similar with the 
participation of Ministers or even the President. She 
commented that Embassy programs could potentially assist in 
the planning and such a program would be a great way for the 
population to see that the government was truly concerned. 
 
9. (C) Comment: Many Djiboutians will say that the trash 
problem has been steadily increasing in the past ten years 
with very little government action to fix it.  According to 
Embassy local staff, there have been sporadic campaigns to 
clean up the city and enforce the laws, often around 
elections. The past campaigns have not worked well because 
there was little government follow through. One push to clean 
up the city in the early 1990\'s involved the city mayor 
confiscating all stray goats and sending them to prison, as 
food for the inmates. It is hard to tell whether this plan 
will work any better than previous ones, but in recent weeks 
Embassy officers have seen more frequent appearances of the 
often elusive trash trucks and even street cleaning teams 
sweeping at night. Many suspect that this campaign is merely 
a pre-election push to show voters how much the current 
administration does for them. Post is highly suspect of the 
will of the Government or even the Voirie to change or 
improve the trash situation. Guedi\'s commentary on the 
usefulness of the incinerator, combined with information from 
the Camp regarding unwillingness of the Voirie to learn how 
to use it suggests a tendency toward excusing inaction rather 
than fixing a serious national problem. End Comment.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT GUELLEH AND U.S-DJIBOUTI BILATERAL 
RELATIONS 
 
Classified By: AMBASSSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) Ambassador met with President Ismail Omar Guelleh on 
December 2, at her request.  The purpose of the meeting was 
to discuss the current state of U.S.-Djibouti bilateral 
relations as well as developments in the region.  Septels 
cover discussions on Camp Lemonier lease negotiations and 
regional developments.  Pol/Econ (Embassy notetaker) joined 
the Ambassador in the meeting at the Presidential Palace. 
Osman Ahmed, Minister of the Presidency, sat in with Guelleh 
on the Djiboutian side. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador began by asking Guelleh for an assessment 
of his September visit to the U.S. to participate in UNGA. 
He replied that the trip had been \"very, very good, very 
pleasant, and very fruitful.\" His meetings with members of 
the House and Senate were particularly interesting as they 
were his first opportunity to see how affairs are handled in 
respective departments and committees.  The meetings were 
also a chance for him to brief members of Congress on 
Djibouti\'s activities and to see how they view the relations 
proceeding.  Guelleh said the congressmen were also 
interested to hear Djibouti\'s views on relations between 
their two countries.  Guelleh expressed hope that he had 
succeeded in conveying his message well. He had not met with 
senior U.S. officials. He told Ambassador that during his 
trip, he had not wanted \"to disturb Administration 
officials,\" who seemed \"to have other issues on their mind\" 
during UNGA. He said, nonetheless, the trip was very useful 
and he had been particularly impressed by retired congressman 
Ronald Dellums of California and the meeting the two had had. 
 
3. (C) To Ambassador\'s invitation to Guelleh to provide his 
assessment of the current state of U.S-Djibouti bilateral 
relations, Guelleh responded that he wanted a closer 
relationship with the United States administration.  This is 
why, he said, Djibouti had hired a firm in the U.S. to assist 
in this effort.  He said Djibouti was committed to go forward 
and join countries that are \"closest to the hearts of the 
Administration and to the President of the United States.\" 
\"As you know,\" he recounted, \"Djibouti is a very poor 
country.\"  Yet the World Bank has determined that Djibouti is 
not eligible for certain loans because of its high per capita 
income among developing countries.  \"This is not good at 
all,\" he said, because Djibouti has genuine needs.  He said 
he had told Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Constance 
Newman during his visit to New York that he would like to see 
Djibouti on the list of countries with bilateral development 
assistance through USAID, in order to make the U.S. 
commitment to Djibouti more permanent.  Currently, and in 
prior years, he said, Djibouti has benefited on a more 
intermittent basis from Economic Support funds.  That 
assistance was cut off during the Clinton Administration.  A 
commitment of development assistance, Guelleh stated, would 
provide greater continuity.  Nevertheless, he said he was 
pleased with U.S.-Djibouti cooperation through assistance in 
the education and health domains. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador noted that health and education were the 
priorities for assistance that Djibouti set after Guelleh\'s 
visit to the U.S. in January, 2003.  She asked if he had 
identified other areas of need for Djibouti. Guelleh 
responded that desertification, water accessibility, the 
environment, and private investment from U.S. firms were also 
priorities.  He commented that it was very important that 
Djibouti attract more direct foreign investment.  For 
countries in Africa, that was the only way for development to 
succeed.  Ambassador mentioned the difficulty in encouraging 
U.S. businesses to seek commercial opportunities in Djibouti 
due to the country\'s small market size.  Yet the potential 
certainly exists, she said, in expanding to surrounding 
markets in the region.  Guelleh agreed, and said Singapore is 
an example of what Djibouti would like to become.  It is very 
small but serves all of its neighboring areas.  For example, 
a dream for Djibouti, Guelleh said, is to connect its railway 
to Durban, South Africa.  According to Guelleh, South Africa 
is a plausible market base and is very interested in the 
prospect of developing this rail line.  Djibouti would use 
the new port at Doraleh, managed by \"very efficient and 
successful people\" (note: Dubai Ports International. end 
note) as a way to attract business from landlocked countries. 
 Guelleh commented that from Mombasa to Mozambique, there was 
not an efficient port from which many landlocked countries 
with rich resources might benefit. 
 
5. (C) Ambassador noted additional U.S. assistance to 
Djibouti through Foreign Military Financing (FMF). Guelleh 
dismissed FMF\'s impact, saying he had \"given up\" on the FMF 
program.  The first request for material was in 2001, he told 
Ambassador, and it was for heavy-duty trucks.  \"To this day, 
not one truck has been delivered.\"  Ambassador responded that 
the FMF process does take time.  She said she had sent 
messages to Washington inquiring about the status of various 
FMF requests for Djibouti, and believed she had made some 
progress.  Also, she said, General Abizaid promised General 
Fathi during a recent visit that he would also explore the 
matter of FMF delays.  Guelleh shrugged his shoulders, and 
responded that FMF, unfortunately, is a complicated system 
issue for the U.S. 
 
6. (C) Comment: Key Djiboutian ministers, and Ambassador 
Olhaye, have long made a case for development assistance for 
Djibouti.  It is clear Guelleh wants a long-term U.S. 
assistance relationship-- and a long-term USAID presence. 
They believe this is possible under the current 
Administration. There is, however, little faith in the 
utility of FMF. Ambassador has addressed this in Washington. 
A discussion of larger implications of aid issues in 
Djibouti, the impact of Dubai, and the U.S.-Djibouti 
relationship to follow septel. End comment.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C)  Ambassador met with President Ismail Omar Guelleh 
December 2, at her request, to review progress in the U.S. 
bilateral relationship and to solicit the President\'s 
perspectives on regional developments.  The meeting took 
place at the Presidential Palace.  Ambassador and Guelleh 
were joined by Pol/Econ officer (notetaker for Embassy) and 
Minister of the Presidency Osman Ahmed (notetaker for 
Guelleh).  During the discussions, Ambassador raised Camp 
Lemonier access/lease negotiations currently underway in 
Washington between the U.S. Department of Defense and 
Djibouti\'s ambassador, Roble Olhaye. 
 
2. (C) Speaking in English, Guelleh responded that talks were 
proceeding slowly and that it had been difficult working with 
interlocutors at the Department of Defense. He said he did 
not understand why the Department of State and White House 
were not engaged in the negotiating process.  The Department 
of Defense \"lacks experience\" and prefers to \"impose demands\" 
rather than negotiate.  He concluded that the Department of 
Defense \"had become so large\" and \"tentaculaire\" (French, 
meaning tentacular, sprawling) \"that it now wants to act 
fully independent of the State Department.\"  Guelleh said he 
had asked Olhaye to seek a meeting with White House staff and 
State to make them aware of difficulties in negotiations, in 
order that they can assist should problems arise. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador asked Guelleh if Olhaye had briefed him on 
the U.S. military\'s land requirements at Lemonier.  She 
explained that the U.S. military was interested in use of all 
the territory extending from the existing Camp perimeter to 
and including the nearby island.  Guelleh nodded that he was 
aware, and said \"that\'s a lot of land.\"  \"We are ready to 
give you all the land you want,\" he added, \"but you have to 
give us a place to go.\"  Ambassador noted that Sultan Sulayem 
and Abdurrahman Boreh had put forward a proposal to her and 
General Helland, in a recent meeting (see reftel), that the 
U.S. take over the existing Ambouli airport for military use 
and construct a new international airport elsewhere in 
exchange.  She said the Sulayem/Boreh proposal initially had 
no clarification of a role for France, although the two 
subsequently suggested that France and the U.S. could share 
use of Ambouli.  She asked Guelleh if he was aware of the 
proposal.  He said he was aware of it and that he had also 
briefed Olhaye.  He asked the Ambassador what the U.S. 
thought of the proposal. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador replied that it was difficult for the U.S. 
to respond.  She said Sulayem and Boreh are not members of 
the Government of Djibouti.  If their proposal is a 
Government proposal, then he (Guelleh) might ask Ambassador 
Olhaye to raise it directly with Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Whelan.  Guelleh responded that he did not wish to put the 
proposal on the table until he had some preliminary reaction 
from the U.S.  If the U.S. were interested, Dubai Ports 
International (Sulayem\'s company) would be responsible for 
building a new terminal building and for extending and 
preparing the runway.  The U.S. would be responsible for 
taxiways, aircraft parking areas, and the air traffic control 
tower.  France would cover the rest of the airport 
infrastructure.  Ambassador asked Guelleh if he thought 
France would/could finance construction of a new airport? 
Guelleh responded that he \"would talk to them\" and also that 
he was certain they would be willing to pay their share of 
costs. (Comment: It was clear to Ambassador that Guelleh was 
not prepared to raise it with the French until he had an 
indication of U.S. interest in the overall plan. End comment) 
 Ambassador told Guelleh she would share his views with 
Washington. 
 
5. (C) Guelleh went on to say that he wanted a single 
agreement to encompass all issues surrounding the U.S. lease 
of Lemonier.  Ambassador explained that it would not be 
possible to combine the three into a single element, given 
the need for new negotiating authority, possibly under 
congressional mandate, were there to be a single agreement. 
Such a move would only further delay matters.  Guelleh 
appeared to understand, saying that \"if it is the desire of 
our counterparts, we don\'t mind keeping those as three 
different ones.\"  Ambassador recounted the three for 
information purposes, to which Guelleh responded that the 
\"Acquisitions and Cross Services Agreement (ACSA)\" was \"the 
most important.\"  He said the ACSA was \"more profitable\" for 
Djibouti.  However, he continued, it is not being implemented 
\"perhaps because of the laxity of Djibouti.\"  Ambassador 
stated that the ACSA remains in force but that she understood 
Djibouti had not presented the necessary documentation to 
enable that payments be made.  Guelleh admitted that this was 
a problem, saying \"that is why I refer to our laxity.\"  He 
did not say if there were immediate plans to address the 
issue. 
 
6. (C) Comment: Guelleh is clearly ill-at-ease by what he 
sees as \"slow\" and \"difficult\" negotiations in Washington. 
Some of this concern may reflect the influence of Abdurrahman 
Boreh, who made a similar point recently to Ambassador. 
Guelleh and Boreh want to keep the U.S. military account in 
Djibouti. There is no doubt on this score.  The proposal that 
the U.S. military join in an airport construction project in 
exchange for more land and benefits at Lemonier  -- which 
Guelleh appears to support in principle -- is intriguing on 
the surface.  How it would/could work in practice is another 
matter.  Sulayem has estimated a total construction price tag 
of USD 100 million.  If accurate, the U.S. share would be 
roughly a third -- not bad if the U.S. had a long-term lease 
and no other cost requirements under a new lease agreement. 
However, maintenance and preparation of Ambouli would need to 
be factored into the equation as well as whether a mechanism 
exists within Defense to accommodate such a scheme.  For the 
new airport, would there be a fixed charge to each partner? 
Who would manage the project?  How would cost overruns be 
handled?  Guelleh implies that details such as these could be 
worked out IF the U.S. first expresses interest.  Over to the 
Defense negotiating team.  End comment.

REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
 1. (C) In a meeting with President Ismail Omar Guelleh 
December 2 on other matters (reviewed septels), Ambassador 
also sought Guelleh\'s views on regional Horn of Africa 
developments. Topics covered included the new Ethiopian 
five-point peace proposal, Eritrean isolation and meddling in 
Darfur, Libya as regional spoiler, the new Somalia 
transitional president and the future of Somaliland. 
Pol/Econ accompanied Ambassador as notetaker. Guelleh was 
joined by his Minister of the Presidency, Osman Ahmed. 
 
---------------- 
Ethiopia-Eritrea 
---------------- 
 
2. (C) On Meles\'s new five-point proposal to end its conflict 
with Eritrea, Guelleh noted that it very heavily used the 
term \"in principle.\"  Meles had told him, Guelleh said, the 
hardest part of his work was done in putting forward the 
five-point plan. Now, he can look towards getting demarcation 
implemented.  However, Guelleh said, while getting 
demarcation implemented, it is important to open the door for 
discussion on how to solve the problem of Badme being now 
divided into two parts.  There might be human tragedies along 
the border that need resolution, and it would be crucial to 
determine who is responsible. The two leaders must talk 
directly, he said, despite the fact that Eritrea has 
denounced the five-point proposal outright.  He urged the 
U.S. to play a critical role because of its friendly 
relationship with both Ethiopia and Eritrea.  Eritrea\'s 
Isaias is very isolated, Guelleh said.  A third party-- 
Libya-- one of the few friends Isaias has remaining in the 
region, had entered the mix.  The U.S. should put pressure on 
Libya to assist with peace efforts because of that close 
relationship, Guelleh said. 
 
3. (C) Guelleh said he thought Isaias was now meddling in 
Darfur, arming rebels in an effort to de-stabilize Sudan. He 
said he believed this meddling is at the behest of Libya, as 
the arms being provided are of Libyan origin.  He 
re-emphazied that it is important for the U.S. to put 
pressure on Libya.  He also remarked that Isaias\'s actions 
had no logic.  \"He has enough problems in Eritrea that he 
needs to solve rather than looking elsewhere,\" Guelleh said. 
Guelleh was firm in his opinion that it would not be wise to 
give Isaias the impression that his behavior and actions 
against peace are condoned. 
 
----- 
Sudan 
----- 
 
4. (C) Ambassador asked Guelleh for his perspective on the 
current government in Sudan, and what impact a change in 
leadership might have on the country\'s future.  Guelleh 
stated that in his opinion, Bashir had changed focus.  He had 
abandoned old friends, mentors and policies because he wanted 
to seek greater normalcy for his country.  This is one reason 
Bashir has been open to genuine dialogue between North and 
South, Guelleh assessed, and had worked to remove extremists 
from his army and administration.  Guelleh also commented 
that he did not see any other leader currently on the scene 
in Sudan that could lead the country.  If elections were held 
today, Bashir would likely be elected by the majority of the 
people, Guelleh surmised.  He cautioned again, however, about 
Libya.  He said Qaddafi has long had an interest in 
de-stabilizing Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic 
and continues that policy. 
 
--------------------------- 
Somalia and Abdillahi Yusuf 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Guelleh noted that Yusuf had begun to form his 
government and that he appeared to be selecting other 
warlords.  He then said he wanted to watch the reactions of 
Somalis in the diaspora.  He did not think they would like 
Yusuf very much.  He said the approach to peace during the 
Arta Conference that Djibouti had hosted in 2000 was to keep 
the warlords out and to engage civil society.  That did not 
work, Guelleh said, but it would take time to see if Yusuf\'s 
plan of engaging warlords would fare better. 
 
6. (C) Guelleh said it was critical that the U.S. support 
Yusuf.  He could not succeed without that support.  If the 
Europeans see the U.S. supporting Yusuf, they would respond 
in kind.  He said it was unfortunate that the U.S. refused to 
permit Yusuf to travel to New York.  Ambassador noted that 
the U.S. position has been that it wants Yusuf to concentrate 
first on building a government and that building a government 
could then be followed by perhaps addressing other issues 
such as support for an African Union peacekeeping force in 
Somalia. 
 
---------- 
Somaliland 
---------- 
 
7. (C) Asked about the future of Somaliland and Djibouti\'s 
view of Somaliland, Guelleh said the international community 
must push Somaliland to create a climate suitable for talks 
with its brethren in the south.  Ambassador noted the 
firmness of FM Edna Ismail on Somaliland remaining an 
independent entity.  Guelleh said Somaliland must be 
persuaded to rejoin the Somalia body, perhaps in the form of 
a federation, but to rejoin all the same. (Comment: The idea 
of a federation has long been put forward by Djibouti but it 
is unclear what form it would take.  End comment)  He said 
Somaliland has, to its credit, been stable, yet that 
stability has been the result of it being comprised of a 
single tribe. \"We cannot encourage the idea of secession,\" he 
said. If we give Somaliland the green light to go its 
separate way, many countries will follow suit.  Guelleh 
confirmed that this was also the position of the African 
Union. 
 
8. (U) Khartoum and Tripoli minimize considered.

1. (U) This is an action request. 
 
2. (C) Djibouti is a small East African nation with a stable 
government, but has porous borders and exists amid conflicts 
in neighboring Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Djibouti is 
thus impacted negatively by the problem of large numbers of 
refugees and illegal immigrants. However, little trafficking 
in persons can be found. 
 
3. (C) The host government\'s primary focus is transnational 
terrorism and it has been consistently eager and cooperative 
in the Global War on Terrorism.  Yet, law enforcement 
capacity is at best limited. Despite Djibouti\'s strong will, 
identification, investigation, mitigation and prevention of 
transnational terrorism and illegal immigration are 
especially problematic with the present capacity. Djibouti\'s 
law enforcement is underfunded, suffers a lack of physical 
resources, and a distinct absence of professional 
development, research, and ability to train future forces. 
 
4. (C) Current anti-terrorism programs address immediate, 
short-term training needs, but fail to provide sustainability 
and long-term development of law enforcement agencies in 
Djibouti.  Post holds that proposals aimed at reinforcing 
overall capacity are preferable over those aimed at a single 
aspect of law enforcement problems in Djibouti. For example, 
a program that addresses the porous nature of Djibouti\'s 
borders with long-term sustainable law enforcement training 
would prevent transnational terrorism, trafficking in persons 
and illegal immigration and would better suit the needs of 
the host nation and the interests of the United States. 
 
5. (U) Action request: Post requests that INL consider 
developing a program that provides grass roots and academy 
training, enhances the long-term capacity of host country 
National Security Services, and allows for the professional 
development of law enforcement.

SUBJECT: SOMALILAND FOREIGN MINISTER SEEKS INTERIM STATUS 
FROM U.S. 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA D. RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C)  Edna Ismail Aden, Foreign Minister of Somaliland, 
told Ambassador December 5, during their meeting at the 
Sheraton Hotel, that Somaliland is interested in reviving 
\"interim status\" recognition for Somaliland first discussed 
and considered during the waning days of the Clinton 
Administration.  Such a status, she said, would give 
Somaliland greater security, provide access to international 
financial institutions, provide eligibility for development 
assistance, enable Somaliland to refine its credibility, and 
give Somaliland \"acceptable\" passports. \"We want,\" Aden said, 
\"to be brought in from the cold.\" 
 
2. (C) Aden, on a December 3-5 visit to Djibouti, requested 
the meeting with Ambassador and was accompanied by Abdillahi 
M. Duale, Somaliland\'s Minister of Information and National 
Guidance.  Aden and Duale had earlier met with President 
Guelleh.  Aden told Ambassador that she raised with Guelleh 
Somaliland\'s interest in \"revival\" of the \"interim status\" 
concept with the U.S. and that Guelleh had \"supported\" them. 
Despite Ambassador\'s probing, Aden was less clear on how that 
interim status would unfold or its implications.  Was she 
anticipating, for example, some type of informal recognition 
or agreement? 
 
3. (C) Aden replied that \"interim status\" could take any 
form.  The important point, she said, was that U.S. action 
would likely lead others to take similar steps.  She said a 
number of western countries had told her that they did not 
want to be the first to recognize Somaliland and likened 
Somaliland to a \"beautiful woman that no one wanted to marry.\" 
 
4. (C) Ambassador noted the U.S. and African Union positions 
to date, including that of Djibouti, which supported the 
concept of a Somali whole, rather than a cantonized entity. 
She said Abdillahi Yusuf appeared to be making efforts to put 
together a government, although he had not yet returned to 
Somalia.  Did Somaliland see possibilities in working with 
Yusuf as the new interim President?  Aden replied in the 
negative, and insisted that Yusuf is an individual who will 
never have the support of Somaliland\'s people.  The wounds 
are too deep, she said. (Comment: She showed Ambassador 
photos which she believed illustrated the atrocities that 
Yusuf had committed against Somaliland that could not be 
forgotten. End comment)   She continued that Yusuf is an 
individual who speaks positively, but behaves quite 
differently. He is a \"trigger-happy\" character who lacks the 
ability to control others, including his own relatives. 
Moreover, she said, Yusuf continues to talk as if Somaliland 
should bear some of the blame for its own suffering at his 
hands, an unfathomable notion.  There is no one in the 
current crop of warlords, Aden said, \"to whom Somaliland can 
safely be wedded.\" 
 
5. (C) Returning to the theme of Somaliland\'s worthiness for 
\"interim status,\"  Aden said  Somaliland was \"a model 
country\" for democracy in the region.  It has a controlled 
army, the diaspora is returning in large numbers, there are 
no arrears in salaries, no hunger and no malnutrition.  In 
addition, Somaliland has worked feverishly in the global war 
on terrorism.  She said that she had solicited help from Camp 
Lemonier, through the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of 
Africa (CJTF-HOA), on coastal and border security for 
Somaliland.  President Guelleh considered it a \"good idea\" 
that Somaliland send someone to Djibouti to work directly 
with CJTF-HOA to train in border security techniques.   This 
is important, she said, in view of efforts by Yemen to 
destabilize Somaliland, in cooperation with Abdillahi Yusuf. 
Aden accused Yemen of providing arms to Yusuf and of paying 
USD 2 million to help Yusuf get elected as interim Somali 
president.  She said Yemeni arms had already been used 
against Somaliland in recent clashes around Las Anod. 
 
6. (C) As for the African Union, Aden said she hopes to meet 
soon with President Obasanjo of Nigeria to discuss 
Somaliland\'s future and particularly the seat of Somalia in 
international organizations.  Somaliland had put forward 
several ideas on this score. 
 
7. (C) Aden and Duale were on their way back to Somaliland 
following a trip to Europe, where Aden said they had 
discussed the October Stockholm meeting on Somalia.  Aden and 
Duale had asked the EU that a portion of resources allocated 
to Somalia be also shared with Somaliland.

1. (U) Summary: On November 29th, the Djibouti National 
Assembly officially opened its second session, known as the 
budgetary session, for 2004 in a ceremony presided over by 
Prime Minister Dileita Mohamed Dileita. The ceremony, in 
which PM Dileita and National Assembly President Idriss 
Arnaoud Ali spoke, was attended by government officials, 
members of the Diplomatic corps, and UN agencies. The PM\'s 
speech highlighted the accomplishments of the 2004 budget and 
enumerated several significant line items for fiscal year 
2005. He also commented on current economic and political 
events in Djibouti, regional issues, and international 
concerns. President of the National Assembly, Idriss Around 
Ali\'s speech was slightly critical, lamenting the small 
amount of time given by the government to study the 2005 
budget. Ali also touched on upcoming reforms to invigorate 
the work of the National Assembly. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On the opening of the budgetary session of the 
National Assembly, November 29th, Prime Minister Dileita 
Mohamed Dileita\'s commentary on the performance of the 
Djiboutian economy was positive. He said despite climbing oil 
prices and the dollar\'s slump compared to the Euro, 
Djibouti\'s economy sustained its current level during 2004. 
Inflation was kept to three percent. Dileita also enumerated 
the government\'s hopes for the 2005 budget, citing four major 
projects that will be started during the fiscal year. 
Consolidating macroeconomic stability, launching economic 
growth, improving of human resources in education and health, 
and developing of socioeconomic infrastructures were named as 
key priorities for the Government. 
 
3. (U) According to Dileita, the 2005 budget is 43 billion DF 
(approx. 243 million USD). He also projected national growth 
to climb to as high as 3.5 percent. Dileita commented that 
projected budget savings will be reinvested in improving the 
capital-city through a clean-up campaign with a budget of 700 
million DF (3.9 million USD). Rehabilitation of urban 
infrastructures will comprise 315 million DF (1.8 million 
USD). Finalizing the Ali Sabieh cement factory through 
self-investment will take 1 billion DF (5.7 million USD). 
Social spending is also expected to rise substantially due to 
education, health and labor measures. 
 
4. (U) An 18 billion DF (101 million USD) program to 
construct schools and hospitals will be financed by foreign 
funding, including a new hospital for Balbala. The Cite Hodan 
housing project began by the Abu Dhabi Fund will be expanded 
from 842 units to 1842 units. Industrial projects such as the 
cement and ceramic factories in Ali Sabieh will also be 
launched. Rehabilitation of the road between Tadjourah and 
Obock is also slated for 2005 funding. Dileita also stated 
that planned rehabilitation of roads inside the city\'s 
commercial center has just begun and the Arta- Dikhil road 
construction has just been completed. 
 
5. (U) Dileita stated that due to the trust of international 
partners, public investments are growing. He cited examples 
of public projects to be done in 2005 including the 
construction of the Doraleh oil terminal, the regional 
livestock exportation center, the commercial center and 
housing development in Haramous, and construction of new 
international hotels. According to Dileita, these ventures 
would also lead to road improvements around the projects. 
 
6. (U) The speech of Idriss Arnaoud Ali, the President of the 
National Assembly, was somewhat critical towards the 
government, specifically mentioning the late passage of the 
budget to the Parliament. He lamented that budget discussions 
would not have sufficient time due to time constraints before 
the end of the years. (Note: The government had previously 
said that the budget proposal would not be delivered on time 
because it had to be approved by IMF specialists. The budget 
was not approved until the night before the opening ceremony 
of the session. End Note.) Ali requested the government stop 
the habit of delaying important proposals like the budget 
because the MP\'s needed to discuss it thoroughly before 
expediting it. 
 
7. (U) Ali, who seems to have the will to make changes, 
openly stated his regret for the dilapidated state of the 
National Assembly\'s building. He took the opportunity to 
announce that Parliament will move to the \"Palais du Peuple\" 
(the government convention center) until the new parliament 
building is completed. (Note: This project is being financed 
by a loan from Iran and is expected to take one year to 
complete. End Note.) Ali also announced  establishment of an 
Ad Hoc commission backed by an international expert to 
examine ways to improve the functioning of the parliament. 
 
8. (C) Comment: The Ad Hoc commission Ali refers to is part 
of a project financed by the UN Program for Development 
(UNDP). As part of this project, the National Assembly has 
brought in a former French MP, who used to be a 
constitutional professor, to serve as a consultant. 
Reportedly, he threw out almost every article of interior 
house rules and said that the work of a parliament was not 
understood at all in Djibouti. The MPs were doing merely a 
minute-by-minute record of the government\'s laws and this is 
not what their work should entail. He said among the 65 MPs, 
only 15 would stand as good parliamentarians in western 
standards. He also commented even in the French parliament 
only 55 out of 577 are considered truly effective. 
 
9. (C) Comment cont. On December 6th, the Minister of Finance 
reportedly told UNDP Country Representative that the French 
consultant was requested to leave Djibouti within 24 hours. 
This request came after the consultant criticized the 
government\'s habit of giving the Parliament only bureaucratic 
tasks, such as approving the budget, while neglecting the 
more important aspects of Parliamentary duties. The 
consultant is reportedly not being asked to leave after 
UNDP\'s Country Representative told the Minister of Finance 
that the National Assembly would first need to be consulted, 
as the consultant works now for the National Assembly. End 
Comment.

Classified By: Pol/Econ Erinn C. Reed for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: In a move aimed at currying the Djiboutian 
vote resident in Somaliland, Mohamed Daoud Chehem, President 
of the Djiboutian Party for Development (PDD), visited 
Hargeisa, Somaliland 1 December. While in Hargeisa, Chehem 
met with officials from Somaliland opposition party Kulmiye 
to discuss Djiboutian presidential elections slated for April 
2005. Chehem also gave an interview to reporters from the 
Somaliland daily newspaper \"Haatuf\" following the meeting. 
During the meeting, and announced in his interview, Chehem 
stated the intention to recognize Somaliland should the 
opposition win in April. News of Chehem\'s unilateral advance, 
meeting with Somaliland opposition and interview with the 
press created an uproar among the opposition coalition, Union 
for Democratic Alternance (UAD). As a result, in a joint 
meeting 5 December, UAD officials unanimously voted to 
exclude PDD from the coalition. The opposition journal, La 
Realite, called Chehem\'s actions a flagrant violation of 
UAD\'s agreement to unanimity. Somaliland Foreign Minister 
Ismail places little stock in the ability of PDD to be 
victorious in a run for Djibouti\'s presidency. However, if it 
did win, Somaliland would welcome recognition , in Ismail\'s 
words, \"with open arms.\" End Summary. 
 
2. (U) A delegation from the Djiboutian opposition party 
Djiboutian Party for Development (PDD) traveled to Hargeisa 
at the invitation of Somaliland opposition party Kulmiye. 
Mohamed Daoud Chehem, President of PDD, and Hassan Mohamed 
Hassan, Vice president of PDD, met with the executive 
committee of Kulmiye to discuss upcoming presidential 
elections in Djibouti and a possible cooperation between the 
two oppositions. The meeting was held behind closed doors, 
but both sides spoke to the press afterward. In an interview 
with Somaliland daily newspaper, Haatuf, Chehem stated if the 
opposition won in April, Djibouti would recognize Somaliland 
as an independent nation. Kulmiye officials said that they 
support this declaration. 
 
3. (U) The reaction to Chehem\'s statement among the 
opposition parties at home in Djibouti was less than 
enthusiastic. Chehem was landbasted for taking unilateral 
actions and speaking in the name of UAD without consultation. 
The leaders of the other three parties in UAD held a joint 
meeting 5 December to discuss Chehem\'s actions. In a press 
communiqu, the three leaders stated unanimously that PDD 
would be excluded from the coalition. The leaders cited 
repeated breaches of the UAD unanimity agreement, most 
notably Chehem\'s \"illegitimate\" announcement for presidential 
candidacy, as basis for the party\'s exclusion. 
4. (U) In the 8 December edition of \"La Realite\", published 
by the Republican Alliance for Democracy (ARD), ARD said it 
remains faithful to its former president Ahmed Dini Ahmed\'s 
declaration in 1992 on recognition of Somaliland. However, 
the current leaders of ARD said they would never assume that 
the whole of UAD supported that statement without 
consultation. The UAD would be weakened, the article 
continued, by an individual interested in pursuing personal 
gain and ready to betray the hopes of people. 
 
5. (C) Somaliland FM, Edna Ismail, commenting to Ambassador 
on the Kulmiye/PDD meeting, said it did not generate much 
public resonance, but had also been raised with her by 
President Guelleh. She said she believed that all know the 
chances of victory for PDD are slim and much hope is not 
placed on promises often made by campaigning politicians. \"It 
goes without saying, however, that if they win and they do 
recognize Somaliland,\" she added, \"we would welcome it with 
open arms.\" (Comment: This comment, in jest, should not be 
interpreted as an indication of support by Somaliland of the 
PDD. End Comment.) 
 
6. (C) Comment: Somaliland is closely tied to Djibouti 
through its economy and border, but most importantly through 
familial relationships. It is a common practice for 
Djiboutians to retire to Somaliland because of their roots, 
cost of living and climate. It is rumored that in past 
elections the government authorities have managed vote 
collecting operations in Somaliland. Some believe the 
Government of Djibouti has given Somalilanders Djiboutian 
National Identity Cards in return for a vote for the ruling 
party. The actual number of Djiboutians living in Somaliland 
is unknown, but estimated at around 2,500 persons - a large 
number in terms of Djiboutian elections. 
7. (C) Comment cont: PDD\'s goal is most likely aimed at 
pulling votes away from RPP in Somaliland by offering 
recognition, something Guelleh cannot promise without 
stepping on the toes of several international partners. PDD\'s 
actions, according to earlier conversations with Chehem (see 
reftel), have been driven by the desire to divide the voting 
population as much as possible to prevent Guelleh from 
receiving a majority right off the bat. Chehem\'s talks with 
Kulmiye on cooperation would help in this task, potentially 
meaning Kulmiye would campaign for PDD among the Djiboutian 
community in Somaliland. 
 
8. (C) Comment cont: Chehem is not known as a charismatic or 
popular individual in Djibouti. Information available to Post 
does not indicate that Chehem would be a candidate likely or 
able to attract the numbers necessary to defeat Guelleh. His 
strategy in catering to the Somaliland votes and utilizing 
cultural connections to divide the Djiboutian vote is 
cunning, but it is too soon to say whether it will bear any 
political fruit come April elections. End Comment.

SUBJECT: DISCUSSING SECURITY IN DJIBOUTI: OUR RESPONSE TO 
JEDDAH 
 
1.(U)SUMMARY: On 12/7/04 and 12/8/04 the Ambassador called 
meetings with all Embassy staff and available American 
wardens to discuss recent events at the U.S. Consulate in 
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. All attendees were reminded that both 
Foreign Service Nationals and Americans are considered 
targets for terrorists, and they were urged to remain 
vigilant about both personal and Embassy security. END 
SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) On 12/7 The Ambassador convened a meeting of 
Americans, FSNs and available wardens to share information 
about the Jeddah consulate attacks and to show unity with 
colleagues who were injured or killed. After a moment of 
silence, she emphasized the importance of security for 
Mission personnel and the American community. She invited 
the Regional Security Officer (RSO) to speak and to provide 
follow-up for members of the American community concerned 
about safety issues. 
 
3. (U) The RSO told the assembly that the security posture 
in Djibouti has not changed and that a threat of terrorist 
action remains. He reminded Americans and local staff to 
practice extreme vigilance. The RSO said that vehicles are 
frequently used in attacks against American interests and 
that surveillance generally takes place for some period of 
time before an attack. He underscored that suspicious 
activity should be immediately reported to the Embassy 
Security Staff. 
 
4. (U) On 12/8 the Ambassador called a second meeting to 
share additional details of the attack. She read the names 
of the dead and injured from the attack, including the 
positions they occupied at CG Jeddah, focusing staff 
attention on how terrorist attacks could impact a broad 
section of mission operations, not only local guards.  She 
reiterated the importance of personal security measures. The 
Ambassador advised Americans in the audience that the 
Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens to defer 
travel to Saudi Arabia and said that the Travel Warning for 
Saudi Arabia urges private Americans currently there to 
depart. 
 
5. (U) During this second meeting, the RSO described, in 
general terms, the attack itself, reporting that several 
people stormed the Embassy compound \"using vehicles, 
explosives and small arms fire to inflict as much damage and 
loss of life as possible.\" He reiterated the need for 
vigilance, teamwork and attention to security procedures and 
informed the Embassy staff that he would be meeting with 
each section individually over the next week to review these 
procedures. 
 
7. (U) Minutes of these two meetings were forwarded, for 
information purposes, to wardens who were unable to attend.

1. (C) Pol/Econ delivered demarche per reftel 9 December to 
Director of Bilateral Relations, Mohamed Ali Hassan. Hassan 
explained Djibouti\'s position on the two cases, particularly 
that of Iran, as a matter of differing approaches to the 
problem. For Djibouti, the approach utilized most often in 
the UN has become a \"little old\" and serves to accuse rather than 
engage that country in the problem. He commented that \"accusatory 
resolutions\" submitted time and again have had little or no 
effect on many situations around the world. He cited Israel 
and Kashmir as two examples. Instead, he proposed, these 
countries in question might be better approached by their 
close allies and neighbors. 
 
2. (C) Continuing, Hassan said the issue of Human Rights 
has been one discussed between Iran and Djibouti several times. 
This approach facilitates demarches as they come from trusted 
friends. One key to this approach was awareness and working to 
educate leaders of these countries on the issues of Human Rights. 
Hassan added that countries that submit the resolutions need to 
be receptive to solving issues in alternative ways. Pol/Econ 
commented that the resolutions concerned were likely to ensure 
that unacceptable policies were not condoned by inaction. 
Hassan agreed that the end goal of the two approaches were the 
same and that it was necessary to make certain actions that 
violated human rights were condemned.

ARREARS 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) Mobil Oil\'s Chief Executive in Djibouti, Alain Adam, 
met late on December 8 on an urgent basis with Ambassador to 
report that he had been approached at his office only an hour 
earlier by two representatives of Djibouti\'s security forces. 
 They had come to arrest him at the behest of Djibouti\'s 
Director of Finances at the Ministry of Finance, Abdullahi 
Guedi. 
 
2. (C) According to Adam this action was an outcome of the 
decision Adam had taken to terminate all fuel and oil 
supplies to the Government of Djibouti effective December 6 
until Djibouti made an effort to settle its nearly 
112,000,000 Djiboutian Francs ($633,000) indebtedness to 
Mobil for fuel and oil already delivered under contract to 
the Government of Djibouti.  At a minimum, Mobil was seeking 
immediately 40,000,000 Djiboutian Francs ($226,000), a 90-day 
arrears.  Adam said he had told the security officers that 
there was no basis for the Director\'s move to have him 
arrested and that he had merely attempted to collect a 
legitimate government-owed debt.  Adam presented evidence to 
the police of the indebtedness.  He said the security 
officials told him that they would depart but would return 
after they had further consulted with their superiors.  Adam 
left his office immediately after the security officials, to 
meet with his attorney, Alain Martinet, and subsequently with 
Ambassador.  Ambassador urged Adam to follow his attorney\'s 
advice and to keep the Ambassador informed on developments. 
As Mobil is an American company she stood ready to assist the 
company work with Government officials, if Mobil wishes her 
to do so.  Adam thanked Ambassador and pledged to keep her 
informed. 
 
3. (C)  Fortunately, Djiboutian security officials did not 
return to complete their arrest of Adam.  However, Adam, as a 
follow-up, sent a letter the next day, with copy to the 
Ambassador, outlining Government of Djibouti arrears to Mobil 
for fuel deliveries extending back to February, 2004.  On 
December 13, Adam met with Hassan Said, Director of National 
Security Services, who, according to Adam, confirmed sending 
the security forces to have him arrested.  Adam said he told 
Said that he understood Djibouti was in temporary financial 
difficulty, but that Mobil was a company that also had 
responsibilities.  Said had been attentive, Adam reported. 
He told Adam he would raise the matter directly with 
President Guelleh.  There should, Said had stated, be a 
response in a couple of days. 
 
4. (C) The evening prior, French Ambassador Phillippe Selz 
approached Ambassador at a reception and advised her of his 
plans to raise the threat of arrest and deportation of Adam 
with Djiboutian authorities.  Selz explained that as Adam is 
a French citizen, he had an obligation to move to avoid an 
incident posed by his possible arrest and deportation. 
Ambassador told Selz that as Mobil is a U.S. company, she is 
very concerned by the security forces\' actions and was 
prepared to intercede with the Government of Djibouti, if 
Mobil requests that she do so.  Her concern, of course, would 
be reassurance of equitable and fair treatment for this U.S. 
company which is seeking payment of an outstanding bill for 
services rendered. 
 
5. (C) Summary:  Adam and Director of Finances Guedi have 
little rapport at this point.  Guedi has threatened Adam that 
Mobil will \"never\" receive its money owed if it doesn\'t 
continue with fuel deliveries. Adam pledges to continue to 
refuse delivery.  Guedi is facing pressure from a government 
constantly forced by budgetary difficulties to juggle its 
creditors and accounts.  Adam, a business person, is looking 
at the bottom line and business purpose.  Might the 
Djiboutians look elsewhere for fuel needs?  Adam insists that 
Mobil has been the sole company among the three suppliers in 
Djibouti willing to provide fuel on credit to Djibouti. There 
are, nevertheless, reasons to be optimistic that the 
Government of Djibouti will not move further to carry out its 
threat to arrest Adam.  Adam has done a fairly good job of 
informing key players of his dilemma and the optics of an 
arrest on grounds of a demand for legitimate payment are not 
at all good for Djibouti.  Our guess is that at least part of 
the arrears will be settled in the coming days, although we 
are not sure out of what financial hat this rabbit will 
eventually be pulled.  End comment.

B) Do you have sufficient staff to meet consular MPP 
objectives? (If you believe you do not, describe steps you 
have taken to maximize staff efficiency.  Note any special 
circumstances at your post that hinder productivity. 
Specify the number, type, and grade of personnel you would 
need in order to fully meet MPP objectives).  Add any 
comments you might have on the effectiveness of training of 
new personnel (such as Congen, FSI language training, etc.) 
 
- The demands of the Consular section require a full-time 
dedicated officer. However, the only assigned officer also 
holds a Pol/Mil portfolio, as well as additional reporting 
duties. 
 
- We have sufficient FSN staff, but our senior FSN is 
retiring this year and an FSN-7 replacement will have to be 
hired for IVs. The other two staff members are both new, and 
need significant training. One of the two left on maternity 
leave two months after she was hired (due to complications, 
the leave was significantly earlier than expected) and she 
has not yet returned. We are doing onsite training, but 
training has been unstructured and the knowledge transfer 
has been slow. 
 
C) Do you have sufficient space to meet consular MPP 
objectives?  (If you believe you do not, describe the nature 
of the space limitations.  Note steps post has taken to 
address these limitations, including development of design 
proposals, allocation of post funds, requests for OBO or CA 
funding, etc.) 
 
- The consular space is insufficient. The waiting room is 
designed to have individuals sitting less than two meters 
from the only interview window. Compounding this situation, 
is the lack of microphones; the net result is that clients 
in the waiting room necessarily overhear all conversations 
at the interview window. 
 
- The physical layout of the consular workspace is badly 
designed, resulting in no direct access or line of sight 
from the office to the rest of the section where the FSNs 
work, and where the files and the cash register are kept. A 
proposal with alternative floorplans has been submitted to 
CA for funding consideration under the Consular Improvement 
Initiative. 
 
- There is only one window in the consular section to handle 
all interviews, cashier transactions, AmCit services, as 
well as any routine inquiries. 
 
D) Describe any management practices (such as off-site fee 
collection, use of a user pays call center, courier 
passback, post hosted web appointment system, business 
programs) that post has instituted in the past year.  Are 
these management practices effective?  Also, please list any 
management practices that have been discontinued in the past 
year, citing reasons for their termination. 
- No new management practices have been initiated or 
discontinued in the past year. 
 
E) Please advise whether and why post might benefit from a 
Consular Management Assistance Team (CMAT) visit.  (By 
year\'s end, CMAT\'s will have visited since their inception 
nearly 60 posts.  If a CMAT visited your post over the past 
year, please summarize any benefits and what steps, if any, 
could be taken to further enhance the productivity of CMAT 
visits.) 
 
- A CMAT visit would be welcome. All the current FSNs as 
well as the Consular Chief of Section have less than six 
months consular experience. The five-month gap between the 
last Consular Officer and the current Officer was filled by 
a succession of WAE TDYers with no overlap. A CMAT team 
could assist in pointing out efficiencies in procedures or 
processes that might normally have passed on through 
institutional knowledge. 
 
Systems: 
F) Do you have the equipment you need to meet consular MPP 
objectives?  (If you believe you do not, describe the 
equipment you need and efforts you have made to obtain it.) 
 
- Current equipment is adequate to meet mission objectives. 
 
G) How would you rate your consular section\'s satisfaction 
with automated consular systems (excellent, good, average, 
poor)? Are there any unresolved software or hardware issues? 
How do you rate the training of post personnel both within 
the consular section and in Management/IM on the use and 
support of Consular systems (excellent, good, average, 
poor)?  What types of assistance would you need from the 
next training and refresher teams coming from the consular 
systems division to assist consular system users? Please 
also comment on the quality of assistance provided by the CA 
Overseas Help Desk. 
 
- Consular section satisfaction with the automated systems 
is good. A significant benefit can be derived from learning 
best ways to use it. The Consular Officer was surprised to 
receive an email advising that the section was not using the 
automated passport system. The Officer was unaware of post\'s 
capability. Training is rated as poor since staff members 
present at the time of installation claim they were unaware 
of the capability. After figuring out how to use it, its 
automated process is immensely appreciated. 
 
- Attempting to run reports or gather data from our 
automated systems for the Consular Workload Statistics 
System proved to be a frustrating exercise that yielded 
unreliable results. We returned to manually adding totals 
from a year\'s worth of receipts to estimate consular 
statistics. 
 
- Djibouti would appreciate an automated systems training 
team to show us what systems are available, and how to use 
them effectively. A team from Washington came in June, but 
given the turnover in personnel we have requested an 
additional Orkand training visit, tentatively scheduled for 
February 5, 2005. 
 
H) Some posts have recently begun scanning 2-D barcodes to 
input DS-156 information into consular systems.  Please 
comment on other forms you would like to see automated and 
explain why. 
 
- Any systems that could reduce or better track paperwork 
involved in Visas 92s and 93s would reduce section\'s 
workload tremendously. 
 
ACS: 
 
I) What aspects of your ACS work are the most demanding? 
 
- Determining legitimate claims to citizenship - this often 
has to happen before assistance with other citizen issues 
can be rendered. 
 
- Passport applications are not challenging, but are the 
most time consuming part of our ACS work. 
 
- American military personnel from the local-based military 
camp take \"field trips\" to the embassy to request routine 
ACS activities that could be handled by phone or by mail, or 
to inquire about issues not handled by Embassy Djibouti\'s 
Consular section (such as Djiboutian visas). 
 
J) Describe the impact that added responsibilities for 
provision of victims assistance as well as reporting 
requirements (for example, in death cases and for serious 
crimes) have had on your workload. 
 
- The section has had very few cases of victims\' assistance. 
Those few cases have often focus on determining a valid 
claim to U.S. citizenship. Reporting our first death case 
became difficult, and continues as an open file six months 
after the death. The death was a U.S. citizen military 
contractor (not subject to the local SOFA) and the death and 
repatriation of remains were handled by the military and 
only reported to post after the fact. The case remains open 
because the military has not yet released all the details. 
 
Visas: 
 
K) What aspects of your NIV work are the most demanding? 
 
- Socio-economic status is not necessarily a good indicator 
of likelihood of an applicant to return. 
 
- A recent surge in third country nationals from Eastern 
Europe employed by the U.S. military contracting firm 
Kellogg, Brown & Root (KBR) has increased our NIV demand. 
 
L) Describe the impact that post-9/11 changes in NIV 
processing, such as special processing requirements, SEVIS, 
etc. have had on your workflow, including the amount of time 
it takes to conduct an interview. 
 
- Following 9/11, requirements for name clearances from 
Washington increased the workload and the waiting time for 
visas. 
 
M) Please comment on the impact that the fingerprinting 
requirement has had on consular space, processing time, and 
relations with your host country. 
- No discernable impact. A single fingerprint scanner was 
installed at the only interview window, and takes up no 
significant space. Fingerprinting appears to be accepted as 
a matter of course. The only pushback has been from lower- 
level government functionaries who remain subject to the 
fingerprinting requirement. 
 
N) What aspects of your IV work are the most demanding? 
(Discussion should address any backlogs and their causes). 
 
- Visas 92 and 93 are our most time consuming cases. The 
majority of these cases are Somali. There is no backlog, but 
cases frequently take years to adjudicate due to a severe 
lack of documentation, difficulties contacting the 
applicants, and the wait for DNA test results. We also have 
a high fraud rate, exacerbated by fluid family structure and 
differing definitions of family relationships (children are 
frequently raised by relatives, and informally \"adopted\" 
children are regularly petitioned as IR-2s or F2s.) 
 
O) If applicable, please describe the impact of the DV 
program on your workload. 
 
- Section does not handle DV cases. Djiboutian DV winners 
apply to Addis Ababa. 
 
P) What percentage of your NIV and IV applicants are third 
country nationals (TCNs)? From what countries are they? Do 
they speak a different language than post\'s designated 
language?  If so, how do you communicate with them? 
 
- Approximately half our NIV applicants and 90% of our IV 
applicants (including 92s and 93s) are TCNs. The IVs are all 
Somali nationals who come to Djibouti because there is no 
U.S. mission in Somalia. They speak Somali, which is not a 
designated language at post (French) but is spoken by all 
consular FSNs, who translate for the Consular officer. 
 
- The NIV cases are more varied, including either local 
residents from Indian citizenship or employees for the U.S. 
military contracting firm Kellogg, Brown & Root (KBR). The 
KBR employees mostly come from the former Yugoslavia 
(Croatia and Macedonia). They all speak English. 
 
Passport: 
 
Q) Discuss how your post has been affected by the Overseas 
Photodigitized Passports program (OPDP) deployed in 2003. 
Please note any major adjustments you have had to make to 
workflow or staffing.  Has the number of emergency passports 
issued at post decreased?  If so, by how much? 
 
- Post\'s first OPDP passport was just processed in November, 
2004. The process went very well, and results are 
satisfactory. This will likely reduce time spent on 
passports and increase AmCit satisfaction by improving the 
speed of return. A serious downturn in emergency passports 
is not anticipated, as emergency passports have not been 
issued in significant numbers. 
 
Fraud Prevention: 
 
R) Briefly summarize the types of fraud most frequently 
encountered at post and programs in place to combat that 
fraud, including use of investigation resources, tracking 
systems, electronic tools, liaison and information sharing. 
If post has conducted a validation study, what was learned 
from it?  Are you satisfied with the level of fraud 
prevention training for officers and FSNs?  If not, what do 
you believe you need to support your efforts in this area? 
Do you conduct in-house fraud training?  If so, who is the 
targeted audience and how often is it done? Do you conduct 
fraud training for non-Embassy consular contacts?  If so, 
who is the targeted audience and how often is it done?  Do 
local authorities effectively prosecute document vendors and 
smugglers? 
 
- While Djiboutian documents are usually genuine, fraud is 
rampant in Somali and Ethiopian documents. Somali passports 
are available for a low cost on the street, so passport 
waivers must be obtained for Somali nationals traveling to 
the U.S. Statements from two witnesses constitutes fact by 
Ethiopian law, so valid government certificates can be 
obtained to show any life event (e.g. birth, death, 
marriage) and cannot be taken at face value. 
 
- Family fraud is also common: DNA tests are routine to 
verify that \"spouses\" are not in fact siblings, and that 
children are biologically related to petitioning parents. 
 
- Djibouti has limited resources for fraud prevention and 
fraud detection training. The consular section lacks 
personnel dedicated to visa fraud investigations. 
 
- Djiboutian officials guard documents closely. The 
Government would likely deal seriously with a sudden 
appearance of fraudulent Djiboutian documents. (Not 
including refugee cards, but they have little value in the 
Consular section.) No attempt is made to curtail fraudulent 
Somali or Ethiopian documents. 
 
General: 
 
S) Describe country conditions that affect your ability to 
provide consular services (infrastructure, fraud, political 
setting, etc.). 
 
- Our refusal rates are lower than neighboring countries. 
French visas are easier to obtain than U.S. visas and have 
more employment appeal to the local francophone population. 
Most unqualified applicants apply to the French consulate 
instead of the U.S. Also, a significant number of would-be 
applicants \"test the water\" with a few questions about 
eligibility and then choose not to apply for a U.S. NIV. 
 
- The recent installation of the U.S. military camp has 
increased Embassy\'s workload significantly. While the 
military forces are covered by a SOFA, AmCit services have 
increased in the form of passport applications, voter 
services, and even adoption cases. The military camp has 
also dramatically increased the workload of non-AmCit 
services due to the large number of military contractors 
applying for U.S. NIVs. 
 
- Also, some of the contractors are bringing families to 
Djibouti. The recent worldwide attention on Djibouti as a 
key location in the Global War On Terrorism has increased 
U.S. Government personnel, attracted NGOs, and otherwise 
gained foreign (including U.S.) attention. According to 
Embassy wardens, three years ago only 50 AmCits were 
resident in Djibouti. Today there are more than 300 non- 
military citizens and more than 3,000 Americans total when 
DoD personnel are taken into account. 
 
T) Describe any other issue not raised in the preceding 
questions that you believe to be significant to the consular 
section\'s effectiveness in handling its responsibilities. 
 
- Post is in the process of initiating a validation study to 
assess NIV return rates. 
 
- The staffing gap in the consular section and rapid 
succession of TDYers filling that gap have been noted by 
both AmCits and Djiboutian government officials. Multiple 
individuals from both groups have expressed relief to learn 
that a permanent Consular officer is assigned for the next 
two years. 
 
- The Consular Section has only one officer who is also the 
Pol/Mil Officer as well as tasked with Somalia reporting, 
and refugee reporting. The consular position demands full- 
time attention, and should be delegated to a focused full- 
time officer. 
 
- The most recent OIG report was conducted during a time 
when a new TDYer had just arrived to fill the staffing gap 
and was unfamiliar with the needs of the section. The 
resulting OIG interview concluded that only 20 hours of 
officer time per week was required to manage the Consular 
section. Subsequent officers have found this estimate to be 
grossly inadequate. 
 
- The senior FSN is retiring at the end of 2004. One other 
experienced FSN left earlier this year. The two replacement 
hires have less than six months experience combined. We are 
evaluating the feasibility of bringing a TDY FSN from 
another similar post with experience in visas 92 and 93 for 
the purpose of training our FSNs.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI: SECURITY CONCERNS AT POST 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MARGUERITA RAGSDALE, 
for reason 1.4 (D) and (G) 
 
1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE, SEE PARAGRAPH 7. 
 
2. (C) Since the inception of the U.S. Military\'s base (Camp 
Lemonier) in 2002,  Djibouti has gained international 
notoriety as a staunch supporter of the Global War on Terror. 
 Although the arrival of the U.S. Military has brought with 
it several tangential benefits, including increased economic 
assistance primarily for education, health and infrastructure 
development, it has also brought with it a greater threat of 
terrorism from trans-national terrorist groups such as Al 
Qaeda and Al Ittihad Al-Islami (AIAI.) 
 
3. (C) Embassy Djibouti has worked diligently to monitor, 
report and mitigate the constant threat stream from the 
region in an effort to prevent another Nairobi or Dar es 
Salaam, or more recently, a Jeddah incident.  Our efforts 
have resulted in improved physical security and procedural 
awareness for security purposes, but the reality remains that 
we are far from being well protected. 
 
4. (S/NF) RSO Djibouti continues to work closely with Host 
nation police and U.S. Military personnel to provide an 
adequate response mechanism for the Mission in a crisis 
situation.  Unfortunately, Host Nation Police are 
inadequately trained, poorly equipped and highly unmotivated 
for such a task.  RSO is consistently addressing issues of 
reliability and procedures with Police leadership, but 
complacency, cultural challenges and extreme weather 
conditions all result in an ineffective first line of 
defense.  Camp Lemonier is fifteen minutes away by road and a 
contingent of Marines stand ready to assist the Mission, but 
the measure will only be effective as a reaction to an 
already devastating event.  We firmly believe that if an 
incident should occur, with a method of operation similar or 
parallel to what took place at Consulate General, Jeddah, the 
Djibouti Mission would suffer greater American and LES 
casualties. 
 
5. (S/NF) Djibouti remains a critical threat Post for 
trans-national terrorism and continues to receive threat 
information on a daily basis.  The compilation of information 
indicates, unequivocally, the potential for an attack to be 
carried out against the Mission and/or Camp Lemonier.  This 
is an impending threat that cannot be ignored.  The Camp 
continues to harden its perimeter, security procedures and 
internal structures and although the Embassy has made several 
improvements, it remains the softer and more attractive 
target for terrorists. 
 
6. (S/NF) Our Mission has tripled in personnel since 2002. 
Existing postage-stamp facilities on the Embassy compound are 
no longer adequate to provide a secure work place for 
American USG Officers and Locally Engaged Staff (LES) 
commensurate with the threat environment.  Office spaces, for 
Americans and LES, are spread throughout the compound over 
four buildings outside the Chancery the majority of which do 
not meet Forced Entry Ballistic Resistant Standards (FEBR.) 
Security features on these buildings have been improved, but 
can easily be defeated by a well trained and equipped 
terrorist or terrorist group. 
 
7. (C) A solution to the security dilemma we face is 
certainly to expedite development of the New Embassy Compound 
(NEC) destined to break ground in 2007 with an estimated 
completion date of 2010.  A purchase agreement for a NEC site 
was signed November 24, 2004 with the government of Djibouti. 
 The NEC will provide adequate and secure facilities needed 
to protect personnel in accordance with USG standards.  In 
the interim, I request that the Department deploy a team 
urgently to Djibouti to assess construction needs and cost 
for necessary and essential security upgrades for Embassy 
Djibouti with a view toward implementing these upgrades on an 
urgent basis.  Post\'s last technical and physical security 
upgrade was completed almost 5 years ago and many of the 
systems in place are now deficient or obsolete.  Post cannot 
handle any field expedient upgrades that are mandated given 
our limited budget and lack of technical expertise. 
 
 
8. (U) I am confident that you will provide a positive and 
quick response to this request. 
 
9. (U) My POC, for security, is RSO Marc Ramos at 
253-35-39-95 or 253-35-26-73 (secure).

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI - 2005 NATIONAL TRADE ESTIMATE 
 
REF: STATE 240980 
 
1. SUMMARY: DJIBOUTI OFFERS A STABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT 
IN A HISTORICALLY UNSETTLED REGION. DJIBOUTI HAS MAINTAINED 
CLOSE COMMERCIAL LINKS WITH FRANCE, WHICH WAS FORMERLY THE 
COLONIAL POWER AND MAINTAINS A LARGE MILITARY PRESENCE IN 
THE COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, DJIBOUTI IS NOW SEEKING TO EXPAND ITS 
ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THE 
UNITED STATES.  THE DJIBOUTIAN MARKET COULD PROVIDE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR U.S. BUSINESS IN SECTORS SUCH AS 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORT, ENERGY AND WATER PROCUREMENT. 
DJIBOUTI HAS NO MAJOR LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT WOULD 
DISCOURAGE FOREIGN INVESTMENT. CHALLENGES FOR POTENTIAL 
INVESTORS INCLUDE THE HIGH COST OF LIVING AND 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, AS WELL AS A SHORTAGE OF 
SKILLED WORKERS. FLUENCY IN FRENCH AND FAMILIARITY WITH 
FRENCH BUSINESS PRACTICES IN AFRICA WILL FACILITATE BUSINESS 
CONNECTIONS. THE DJIBOUTIAN GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY 
ESTABLISHED AN INDEPENDENT AUDITING UNIT IN AN EFFORT TO 
OVERCOME PROBLEMS OF CORRUPTION AND LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN 
THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS.  U.S EXPORTS TO DJIBOUTI IN 
2003 WERE US $31.7 MILLION AND CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF FOOD 
PRODUCTS AND USED CLOTHING.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Import Policies 
--------------- 
2. A license is required to sell or import to Djibouti.  The 
cost of licensing varies according to the professional or 
commercial activities undertaken and the value of the 
imported goods.  Regular import taxes vary from 5% to 40% 
according to the nature of the merchandise.  Ready-made 
clothing is taxed 20% while raw textile materials are 
subject to only an 8% tax.  Although basic commodities enjoy 
low import taxes, goods such as cigarettes and alcoholic 
beverages have required surplus taxes of 70% and 160% 
respectively. 
 
3. Customs officials require a commercial invoice with the 
bill of lading or the airway bill for all goods entering the 
country.  Shipping marks and numbers on the bill of lading 
must correspond exactly with those on the invoices and 
goods.  The goods should be cleared within four to ten days 
of arrival; otherwise they will be moved to a warehouse and 
additional fees will be levied. Cigarettes, fuel, cosmetics 
and other products smuggled through the borders compete with 
legally imported products and represent an important loss of 
revenue for the government. 
 
Standards, testing, labeling, and certification 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
4. There are no specific labeling or marking requirements on 
imports, except for cigarettes.  On order to fight the 
increasing contraband from neighboring countries the 
government has requested cigarette importers to pre-label 
product destined for the Djiboutian market.  It is advisable 
to print any label or marking in French, which is widely 
understood in Djibouti.  Djibouti\'s office for norms quality 
control is still in its nascent stages; thus, specific 
standards do not yet exist.  No testing is performed on any 
product before consumption.  In the case of pharmaceutical 
products, health authorities examine deliveries and issue a 
certificate to the importer after ensuring that a no 
prohibited product is included.  The list of prohibited 
pharmaceutical products is publicly available and can be 
obtained with the assistance of the Embassy. Other 
prohibited imports include illegal drugs, specific medical 
products, environmentally hazardous chemicals, toxic waste 
and some cosmetics. 
 
Government procurement 
---------------------- 
5. Government procurement is conducted through the Ministry 
of Finance.  If the value of the goods is less than 
Djiboutian Francs (DF) 5 million (US$ 28,257), procurement 
is made directly from the vendor. Conformity of the goods is 
verified by a Treasury official before payment is rendered. 
If the amount of the order exceeds DF 5 million, the 
Ministry of Finance calls for tenders, especially for 
projects financed by international donors. 
 
 
Export subsidies 
---------------- 
6. In 2003, Djibouti exported goods valued at about US$ 89 
million.  Exports consisted mainly of personal effects, 
personal vehicles, hides, skins, salt, and re-exported 
products.  The government of Djibouti does not subsidize 
exports. 
 
Intellectual property protection 
-------------------------------- 
7. A provision for intellectual property protection (IPR) 
exists in the penal code, which is inherited from the 
French.  However, it is not enforced.  Djibouti joined the 
African Organization for Intellectual Property Rights in 
1993.  In addition, Djibouti ratified World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO) convention, Paris convention on 
the protection of industrial rights, and Bern convention on 
the protection of literature and art works in January 2002. 
An increasing number of counterfeit products have come to 
the attention of the Ministry of Justice in recent years. 
Post is not aware of any existing prosecution for IPR 
infringement. 
 
Services barriers 
----------------- 
8. The government of Djibouti welcomes all foreign direct 
investment.  Djibouti\'s assets include a strategic 
geographic location, an open trade regime, a stable 
currency, substantial tax breaks and other incentives. The 
government of Djibouti has placed privatization, economic 
reform, and increased foreign investment as top priorities. 
 
9. Telecommunications and other state-owned public utilities 
are increasingly open to investors. Dubai Port International 
(DPI) manages both the port and airport. DPI is also the 
main investor in the Port of Doraleh project, which is 
slated to be completed in 2005 and will consist of an oil 
terminal, a container terminal and an industrial and 
commercial free zone.  Djibouti Telecom and the Railway 
Company are slated for privatization.  Conditions of the 
IMF\'s structural adjustment agreement for Djibouti stipulate 
increased privatization of government-owned monopolies. 
 
 
 
 
Investment barriers 
------------------- 
10. Djibouti\'s investment code guarantees investors the 
right to import all goods, equipment, products, or material 
necessary for their investment activities; freely display 
products and services; determine and run marketing policy 
and production; choose customers and suppliers; and set 
prices.  Foreign investors are also free to determine their 
own hiring/firing policy as long as it conforms to the labor 
code.  Some foreign observers have commented that the 
current labor code inordinately favors employees and thus 
deters increased foreign investment. In response, a new 
labor code has been drafted and is in the legislative 
approval process. If passed, it is expected to shift the 
balance of power favorably to employers. 
 
11. Djibouti has no foreign exchange restrictions.  There 
are no limitations on converting or transferring funds or on 
the inflow and outflow of cash.  The Djiboutian franc, which 
has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1949, is stable and 
easily converted to U.S. dollars or European currency.  The 
fixed exchange rate is 177.71 Djiboutian francs to the 
dollar. 
 
12. Corruption is an issue in Djibouti, although it is not 
as prevalent as in many other parts of the developing world. 
It poses a major problem in the judicial system and results 
in an extreme mistrust by foreign investors. Anti-corruption 
laws exist but are rarely enforced.  In the past five years, 
the government has established both the Chamber of Accounts 
and Fiscal Discipline (CAFD) and the State General 
Inspection to address corruption. The CAFD has the authority 
to verify and audit all public establishments for 
transparency and accountability and take necessary legal 
sanctions.  The State General Inspection is designed to 
complement the work of the CAFD by ensuring that human and 
material resources in the public sector are properly 
utilized.

SUBJECT: 2005 NTE ON THE ARAB LEAGUE - DJIBOUTI 
 
REF: STATE 262883 
 
1. (U) Post\'s 2004 report on the subject remains valid. 
Djibouti does not currently enforce any aspect of the 
boycott against the state of Israel. Israel\'s import code 
has not been removed from the local import codification 
manual and remains 624; however, there is little to no 
direct trade. 
 
2. (U) Djibouti\'s 2005 presidential elections are unlikely 
to bring any changes to the enforcement of the boycott.  As 
part of its foreign policy, Djibouti continues to be a 
fervent supporter of the Palestinian cause and does not 
hesitate to echo Arab condemnation of U.S. policy towards 
Israel and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

CONTROL STRATEGY REPORT INSTRUCTIONS PART II, FINANCIAL 
CRIMES AND MONEY LAUNDERING 
 
REF: STATE 254401 
 
INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
1. Much of the information included in Post\'s 2003-2004 
report remains the same. Djibouti is still the most stable 
country in the Horn of Africa. It is a financial hub in the 
sub-region, thanks to its US dollar-pegged currency and its 
unrestricted foreign exchange.  Officials from the Central 
Bank indicate that there were no recent instances of money 
laundering. The informal market remains important, and 
smuggled goods consist primarily of highly taxed cigarettes 
and alcohol. The Djibouti Free Zone (DFZ), managed by 
Dubai\'s Jebel Ali Free Zone, was inaugurated in June 2004. 
Once operational, the DFZ will approve and deliver licenses 
for up to 85 companies. Djibouti is not considered an 
offshore financial center but offshore institutions are 
permitted, and even encouraged, to settle at the DFZ.  Two 
existing commercial banks handle the bulk of financial 
transactions. The remainder of the demand is met by a 
growing number of hawalas.  The Central Bank makes efforts 
to closely monitor the activities of both the commercial 
banks and hawalas. 
 
Anti-money laundering legislation 
--------------------------------- 
2. On February 22nd, 2001, Djibouti signed the United 
Nations International Convention against Illicit Traffic in 
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which entered 
into force on May 23rd, 2001. Legislation criminalizing the 
financing of terrorism, as requested by UN Security Council 
Resolution 1373, is included in the Anti-Money Laundering 
Law passed in December 2002 as Law No. 196/AN/02/4emeL. 
Drafted by the three-year-old National Committee on 
Terrorism, this document contains provisions for prevention 
of, and punishment for, money laundering. 
 
3. The Anti-Money Laundering Law applies to financial 
institutions of all forms as well as professionals involved 
in financial matters. Regulated activities include money 
deposits, insurance, investment, real estate, casinos and 
entertainment.  The legislation also addresses international 
cooperation and allows for the freezing or seizing of assets 
in suspected terrorist finance cases.  The government 
regularly circulates the names of individuals and entities 
included on the UN 1267 sanctions committee\'s consolidated 
list.  The law also requires financial institutions to 
verify customer information, including current residence. 
This verification process promotes rigorous transparency and 
strict control of transactions. Furthermore, it imposes 
criteria for the following: customer identification; 
communication of information; documentation related to 
international cooperation; surveillance procedures for 
suspect accounts; and legal protection of professional 
secrecy for individuals reporting suspect transactions. 
 
4.  Professionals convicted of facilitating money laundering 
or terrorist financing can face five to ten years in jail 
and a fine of DF 25 to 50 million ($141,283 to 282,566). A 
finance professional that fails to report suspect 
transactions is liable for fines ranging from DF 10 to 25 
million ($56,513 to 141,283).  The Department of Treasury 
receives the proceeds of any assets seized or forfeited in 
terrorist financing cases. 
 
International Cooperation 
------------------------- 
5. Djibouti has not officially reached an agreement with the 
United States government on money laundering, but Central 
Bank officials have repeatedly indicated they would fully 
cooperate if requested. Djibouti has a formal, bilateral 
agreement with Ethiopia for exchange of information and 
extradition in money-laundering cases. Furthermore, the anti- 
money laundering legislation stipulates that Djibouti will 
cooperate with other countries by exchanging information, 
assisting in investigations, providing mutual technical 
assistance and facilitating the extradition process in money 
laundering cases. In addition, the Central Bank plans to set 
up an investigation bureau designed to monitor for money 
laundering and to provide expertise to the banking community 
concerning counterfeit money, including US bills. 
 
 
COMMENTS 
-------- 
6. DJIBOUTI\'S MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING 
STRATEGY TOOK A POSITIVE STEP WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE ANTI- 
MONEY LAUNDERING LEGISLATION; HOWEVER ENFORCEMENT OF THIS 
LAW REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT MAKES 
AN EFFORT TO CONTROL ALL FORMAL TRANSACTION POINTS, A LARGE 
NUMBER OF INFORMAL HAWALAS ESCAPE CENTRAL BANK REGULATION. 
IN ADDITION, CORRUPT CUSTOMS AGENTS CAN EASILY BE TEMPTED TO 
PERMIT LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO COME THROUGH THE BORDERS 
WITHOUT ANY DECLARATION. FINALLY, THERE IS A HISTORY OF 
POWERFUL, \"UNTOUCHABLE\" INDIVIDUALS PROTECTING SUSPICIOUS 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AS FOR THE DFZ, POST WILL MONITOR 
AND REPORT ON ANY MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES WHEN THE DFZ 
BECOMES FULLY OPERATIONAL.

     C. SANAA 3144 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Marguerita Ragsdale. 
For reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Ragsdale delivered reftel (B) 
demarche on December 22 to Minister of Cooperation in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf. Youssouf 
told the Ambassador that the meeting in Khartoum on December 
28 is a regularly scheduled one among the self-proclaimed 
\"axis\" of Sudan, Yemen and Ethiopia. He said it is highly 
unlikely Djibouti\'s President Ismail Omar Guelleh would 
attend (pending confirmation) and that to his knowledge no 
trip is currently planned to Khartoum by President Guelleh. 
Youssouf also said that Djibouti expects that at the axis 
meeting, Yemeni President Saleh will push for greater 
cooperation with Eritrea, which could likely cause the 
collapse of the axis before the end of the year. The 
Ambassador delivered the talking points on Sudan and Darfur 
for Youssouf\'s reference. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) The Ambassador and the POL/PD officer met with 
Minister of Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
Mahamoud Ali Youssouf to address the rumor that President 
Guelleh would be traveling to Sudan on December 26 and to 
deliver talking points on the U.S. position on Sudan and 
Darfur provided in reftel (B). 
 
3. (U) The Ambassador explained that the U.S. is concerned 
that recent events in Darfur will negatively impact 
north-south peace negotiations, and that Secretary Powell 
recently expressed strong displeasure with the Government of 
Sudan\'s failure to abide by commitments to end the violence. 
She asked that President Guelleh convey a strong message to 
Sudan about the importance of living up to its promises. 
 
4. (U) Youssouf indicated that the Djiboutian government is 
also acutely concerned about the Darfur situation, but that 
to his knowledge President Guelleh has no/no plans to travel 
to Sudan at the end of December. He promised to provide 
confirmation to the Ambassador, however, no later than 
Thursday, December 23. 
 
5. (C) Youssouf said that there is a meeting in Sudan at the 
end of the month for the Ethiopian, Sudanese and Yemeni heads 
of state. It is a regularly scheduled one among this 
self-proclaimed axis. He said Djibouti had been approached to 
join the axis several times in the past, especially by the 
Yemenis, and has each time declined because of what Djibouti 
perceives as the group\'s anti-Eritrean political agenda. 
Youssouf said Djibouti told the axis that a regional medium, 
IGAD, already existed, and that meetings promoting regional 
welfare should include all Horn of Africa states, including 
Eritrea, which had not been invited to any of the axis 
meetings. 
 
6. (C) Youssouf added that reports following the recent 
meeting of Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki to Yemen, and 
indications gleaned from the Yemeni president\'s recent 
declarations, leads him to believe that Yemeni President 
Saleh will use the December meeting to mediate in the 
Sudan-Eritrea and Ethiopia-Eritrea disputes and will carry a 
\"very positive, very peaceful message\" to Khartoum. This will 
be a clear change in position for Yemen, which spearheaded 
the formation of the axis, Youssouf said. 
 
7.(C) Youssouf said that tensions remain high between Eritrea 
and Ethiopia. He noted that the recent visit of a U.S. 
delegation to Eritrea, and not Ethiopia, raised questions 
from Ethiopia. Tensions are also high between Eritrea and 
Sudan, Youssouf said, and added that if Saleh promotes 
rapprochement it may cause the collapse of the axis. If Saleh 
cannot convince his counterparts to de-escalate tensions with 
Eritrea, Youssouf predicts Yemen will withdraw from the 
coalition. He added that disputes between Eritrea and other 
countries are poisoning regional relations and pose a \"very 
intricate problem\" in the region. 
 
8.(C) Youssouf said that if South African President Mbeki 
travels to Sudan at the end of December it will likely be to 
address Darfur and to stress the African Union\'s most recent 
and strongly-worded position on the Darfur crisis. 
 
9. (U) Khartoum minimize considered.

Ambassador Ragsdale that Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh 
did talk to Guelleh via phone earlier this week and attempted 
to convince him to attend the meeting, but that Guelleh 
reiterated the standing Djiboutian position on the axis: It 
has an anti-Eritrean political agenda and that meetings 
promoting regional welfare should include all Horn of Africa 
states or be mediated through IGAD (see reftel A). Djibouti 
does not wish to embark on such a program, Youssouf said.

1. (C) SUMMARY: On December 27, the Ambassador and CJTF-HOA 
Commanding General Samuel Helland met with the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Ali Abdi Farah, at the Minister\'s request, to 
discuss the proposed expansion of Camp Lemonier. The Minister 
said that Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh told him 
to convey a message that the Government of Djibouti (GODj) 
does not object in principle to the expansion of Camp 
Lemonier as part of lease negotiations, but that the GODj 
requires that technicians from the Department of Defense meet 
technicians from the GODj in/in Djibouti to do a physical 
survey of the proposed expansion area to avoid confusion over 
the proposed terrain\'s perimeter. The Minister also used the 
opportunity to thank CJTF-HOA for its involvement in civil 
affairs projects and to request three specific projects for 
the town of Arta. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador and CJTF-HOA Commanding General Samuel 
Helland met December 27 with Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali 
Abdi Farah, at the Minister\'s request, to discuss the 
proposed expansion of the territory of Camp Lemonier. No 
advance information on the purpose of the meeting had been 
provided. They were joined by the acting Pol/Econ officer 
(Embassy notetaker) and the Director of Bilateral Relations, 
Mohamed Ali Hassan (GODj notetaker and translator). The 
Minister began by stating that he had personally invited the 
Djiboutian Minister of Defense to join in the meeting, but 
that he was unable to participate due to another pressing 
matter. 
 
3. (C) The Minister continued that President Ismail Omar 
Guelleh specifically requested he convey a message that the 
GODj does not object in principle to the proposed expansion 
of Camp Lemonier, but that it is necessary that technicians 
from the U.S. Department of Defense meet technicians from the 
GODj on the ground in Djibouti to physically walk over the 
land proposed for the expansion. The Minister said the 
diagram submitted for the proposed expansion is not enough 
and that a physical survey is necessary and appropriate for 
transparency and to avoid misunderstandings over what 
constitutes the specific plot of land. He said that it does 
not matter to the GODj whether the technicians come from 
Washington or if the survey is done by American soldiers 
already stationed in Djibouti or by appropriate individuals 
from the Embassy. 
 
4. (C) The Minister stressed that the technicians must \"see 
and agree\" on the proposed plot of land before the GODj will 
approve the expansion. He termed it \"a question of 
confidence.\" He said the land is public property and that the 
GODj wanted to avoid the type of misunderstanding that 
happened during previous lease negotiations for Camp Lemonier 
concerning the Presidential hangar and its surrounding area. 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador inquired whether Djibouti\'s principal 
negotiator for lease discussions, Ambassador Olhaye in 
Washington, is aware of this request. The Minister responded 
that this is a matter that must be taken care of here in 
Djibouti and that Ambassador Olhaye is not in charge of the 
\"technical side\" of the negotiations because he cannot 
physically survey the land. This should be done in 
Djibouti.(COMMENT: The Minister never directly said whether 
or not Olhaye is aware of this request. END COMMENT) The 
Minister also stated that the President believes such a move 
is \"more transparent\" and \"more appropriate,\" so that 
Djibouti\'s army can understand the American military 
requirements and \"have confidence.\" 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador told the Minister she will convey the 
request to Washington, but the decision must be made there, 
as neither the Embassy nor CJTF-HOA are involved in the 
negotiations. General Helland concurred, and the Minister 
said he understood. 
 
7. (C) General Helland stressed to the Minister that there 
can be only one contact person for the survey, and that the 
Department of Defense currently considers Ambassador Olhaye 
to be the contact person for negotiations. The Minister said 
he will ask the President who should be considered the 
primary point of contact in Djibouti for the technical survey 
and will pass the information to the Ambassador by the 
afternoon of December 27 or the morning of December 28. 
 
8. (C) The Minister expressed President Guelleh\'s 
appreciation for the work the American military is doing in 
Djibouti, especially in its primary task: the struggle 
against terrorism. The Minister said that the GODj considers 
this struggle an important stability factor in the Horn of 
Africa. He said the civil affairs work being done in the 
districts is a good initiative and is greatly appreciated by 
the Djiboutian population. He called the school and hospital 
rehabilitations \"fruitful\" adding that they \"bring together 
the American military and the Djiboutian people.\" 
 
9. (C) In addition, the Minister said that during the recent 
Cabinet meeting led by the President in the town of Arta, the 
people complained about occasional noise from a nearby 
joint-use, French-American military training site; however, 
he said that overall the people of Arta were appreciative of 
the American civil affairs efforts in the town and are more 
comfortable with the American military presence following 
these projects. The Minister said he wanted to seize the 
opportunity posed by the General\'s presence to request three 
specific projects for Arta: a small incinerator similar to 
the one installed at Doudah; a small ambulance; and a fence 
around a primary school in the town. 
 
10. (C) The General told the Minister it is a honor and 
pleasure to be a guest in Djibouti and praised the work of 
Generals Fathi and Zacharia as interlocutors with CJTF-HOA. 
The said he looks forward to continuing to work with the GODj. 
 
11. (C) The Ambassador expressed her appreciation for 
CJTF-HOA\'s help to the Embassy and to Djibouti, and told the 
Minister that she hopes that base negotiations will be 
quickly and satisfactorily concluded. 
 
12. (C) COMMENT: The request by President Guelleh, through 
his Minister of Foreign Affairs, for a technical survey 
reflects, in Post\'s view, the Djiboutian military\'s lack of 
confidence in the capacity of Ambassador Olhaye to represent 
fully their interests in the current round of base 
negotiations. While it is a problem in need of an internal 
fix, it has reverberations for the U.S. The Djiboutian 
military does not want \"misunderstandings\" of lease and base 
details. There is an inexact understanding of the specifics 
of the volume of land the U.S. is requesting -- maps, 
diagrams and coordinates notwithstanding. The GODj wants the 
land \"walked off\" (in simple terms), so that there is clarity 
about what areas the Department of Defense envisions a future 
Camp Lemonier encompassing. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: PD FACILITATES LIBRARY OPENING, ENGLISH TEACHING 
WORKSHOP 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: To cap off its December events, Post recently 
facilitated a book donation to an elementary school in one of 
Djibouti City\'s poorest areas. In addition, Post arranged for 
two speakers to participate in a week-long methods and best 
practices workshop for night school English teachers. Both 
events were free of cost for Post. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) On December 20, PAO attended the grand opening of a 
library at Balbala I, a primary school located in one of 
Djibouti City\'s poorest areas. About 1700 students, aged 6 to 
12, are enrolled in the school, which is one of Post\'s 
International Education Week partners. About 250 books in 
French were donated by a church in Canada affiliated with a 
Diplomatic Security employee who served TDY in Djibouti. PD 
identified, packaged and delivered the books and will 
continue to monitor the library\'s use. The school plans 
expand use of the library for teacher training and may 
qualify as an American Corners recipient due to the large 
degree of community involvement on the campus. 
 
3. (U) During the week of December 26, the English Teacher\'s 
Association in Djibouti hosted a methods and best practices 
workshop for night school English teachers. The workshop 
focused on teaching large classes and instruction in English 
as a second language, including creating lesson plans, using 
visual aids and experiential learning. About 25 teachers 
attended. Post arranged two \"speakers of opportunity\" who 
participated in each day of the 4-day workshop. Both are 
English teachers from the U.S. in town on personal business 
loosely affiliated with the Embassy. 
 
4. (U). Post found the workshop to be an effective way to 
promote both English learning and American involvement in the 
community, two activities prominent in Post\'s MPP.

TABLE 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: On Sunday, January 2, the Ambassador met with 
Djibouti\'s Minister of Commerce and Industry, Saleban Omar 
Oudine, at his request. The main purpose of the meeting was 
to solicit the Embassy\'s financial support for a Round Table 
to promote trade. In addition, the Minister requested that 
USAID facilitate the Round Table, which would take place 
sometime after the April presidential election. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) The Ambassador met, on January 2, with Djibouti\'s 
Minister of Commerce and Industry, Saleban Omar Oudine, at 
his request. She was joined by the acting Pol/Econ Officer 
and an interpreter. The main purpose of the meeting was to 
solicit the Embassy\'s financial support for a proposed Round 
Table to promote trade, implement reform of Djibouti\'s 
commercial code and help assure confidence by investors in 
the fairness of Djibouti\'s judicial system. 
 
3. (U) Conference participants would discuss implementation 
of a recent commerce development study that recommended 
Djibouti improve its investment climate, including 
liberalizing its trade code and improving its commercial 
code. The intent, he said, is to \"put all the tools in place 
to give confidence to investors,\" before the opening of the 
Port of Dorale in the summer of 2005. The Minister said he 
saw the Round Table as a way to help the country modernize 
Djibouti\'s few exportable industries, namely salt and fish. 
The Minister said the government would solicit projects 
during the Round Table, although he was unclear who would be 
the conference\'s target. 
 
4. (U) Oudine asked for the Ambassador\'s support of his 
request to have USAID facilitate the Round Table. He said he 
already discussed this possibility with a USAID 
representative in Geneva at a recent conference in that city 
o/a November 28. The other possible facilitators would be the 
French Cooperation Office in Djibouti and The United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP), although UNDP is not favored as 
it already is a partner in the Round Table project. The 
Minister said that, in addition to UNDP and the French 
Cooperation, there are four obvious candidates for financial 
support of the Round Table: The International Monetary Fund, 
the World Bank, the International Cooperation Center (CCI), 
and another UN group. 
 
5. (U) The Ambassador told the Minister the Round Table 
project seemed very broad, and that pulling the requisite 
number of experts together might be difficult in a short 
amount of time. She added that she would like to be 
supportive of the project as it touches a principal area on 
which she plans to focus in the coming year: \"the economic 
prosperity and development of Djibouti.\" She agreed to 
discuss the project with USAID country director Janet 
Schulman when she returns to post next week and requested 
more information from the Minister, in the meanwhile.

1. (U) In the Ambassador\'s January 2 meeting with Djibouti\'s 
Minister of Commerce and Industry, Saleban Omar Oudine 
(reported Ref A), the Minister told the Ambassador that 
Djibouti and Rwanda have switched dates for hosting the 
annual Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) 
summit. Djibouti will now host the summit in 2006 (vice 
2005), and Rwanda will host the summit in 2005 (vice 2006). 
The reason for the change rests in Djibouti\'s inability to 
provide adequate infrastructure, especially hotels, in time 
for this year\'s summit. 
 
2. (U) The Minister said he believed the decision to switch 
the dates was a \"wise\" one, because it would be difficult for 
Djibouti to focus on the necessary infrastructure 
improvements as both presidential and regional elections are 
slated to take place in the spring of 2005. Post notes the 
decision despite backroom politicking by Djibouti to host the 
summit before Rwanda (reftel B). Oudine added that the 
inability to show off the Dorale port and the Djibouti Free 
Zone, which are slated to become fully operational this 
summer, was \"disappointing.\" 
 
3. (U) The Minister highlighted the popularity of the new 
Dorale port in other COMESA countries. At a recent conference 
in Kampala, several Ugandan businessmen expressed interest in 
using the Free Zone for imports and exports. Oudine did not 
specify the businesses, but hypothesized they would likely 
use Uganda airways as the transport link for cargo between 
Uganda and Djibouti. He said this is an attractive option 
because companies currently using the Port of Mombassa for 
imports and exports lose about 20 percent of their product 
annually due to graft and damage.

1. (U) France\'s Ambassador to Djibouti, Philippe Selz, told 
Ambassador January 6 that because of Djibouti\'s location, 
France would be using resources of its forces based here to 
assist with France\'s overall effort to assist tsunami 
disaster victims in Asia. 
 
2. (U) Selz told Ambassador that the French helicopter vessel 
\"Jeanne d\'Arc\" ended prematurely on January 3 its visit to 
Djiboutian territorial waters in order to assist with Asian 
relief efforts.  The vessel departed Djibouti on that date 
for Thailand and Indonesia, filled to the brim with resources 
taken primarily from stocks of the French military outposts 
in Djibouti.  According to Selz, the \"Jeanne d\'Arc\" carried 
seven tons of pharmaceuticals, three helicopters, logistical 
materials to assist in removing debris and building 
structures, 100,000 liters of bottled fresh water, 2000 
folding cots, a high volume of field rations, four medical 
experts from Bouffard Hospital in Djibouti, inflatable tanks 
for water, and products with which to treat water.  He said 
the ship was fully loaded, to the extent that it was forced 
to dismantle some of its pallets and fit items under sleeping 
berths and behind doors to enable transport of all the 
materials.  The vessel also carried, the French Ambassador 
stated, about 45-50 military personnel to assist with the 
relief effort.  The vessel is scheduled to reach its 
destination on January 10. 
 
3. (U) Selz commented that the \"Jeanne d\'Arc\" \"exhausted\" 
most of the reserve items the French military had in 
Djibouti.  He said he expected that French forces in Djibouti 
would be asked to do more in the coming days.

SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI REGIONS PROFILE 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: The great economic disparity between the capital, 
Djibouti city, and the regions outside Djibouti\'s capital is 
a major concern to the regions\' inhabitants. This disparity 
led to a civil war in the early 1990\'s and continues to 
greatly affect the country\'s politics. Post constructed this 
regional profile of Djibouti to better understand the 
development issues most important to the populations in each 
of Djibouti\'s four existing districts as both presidential 
and regional elections approach in 2005. It is divided into 
three parts: A snapshot of each district, district living 
conditions, and political expectations and leanings. END 
SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------- 
SNAPSHOTS OF THE DISTRICTS 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Djibouti is currently divided into the capital city, 
commonly referred to as Djibouti-ville, and four regional 
districts: Ali-Sabieh and Dikhil in the south, and Obock and 
Tadjourah in the north. Vital statistics follow: 
 
 
Ali Sabieh 
Location: South 
Population: 18 589 
Major economic activity: Trade, agriculture and industry. 
Tribe/sub-tribe: Issa/Fourlaba 
 
Dikhil 
Location: South 
Population: 19 592 
Major economic activities: Agriculture, livestock and tourism 
(underdeveloped) 
Tribe/sub-tribe: Issa/Odahgob, Afar/AdaiRasoul 
 
Tadjourah 
Location: North 
Population: 12 471 
Major economic activities: Agriculture and tourism 
Tribe/sub-tribe: Afar/Hassobas 
 
Obock 
Location: North 
Population: 3 297 
Major economic activities: Fishing and tourism 
Tribe/sub-tribe: Afar/Adai\'li 
 
------------------- 
Living Conditions 
------------------- 
3. (U) The great economic disparity between Djibouti\'s capital 
and its internal regions affects the regions\' populations to 
an extreme degree. The majority of economic activity in 
Djibouti is concentrated in and around the capital, Djibouti 
City. There is a limited overall benefit from trucking 
routes to Ethiopia that pass through the districts of Dikhil 
and Ali-Sabieh. Social sectors, such as education and 
health, are also more developed in the capital. The 
population of Djibouti is estimated at around 594,000 with 
67 percent concentrated in the capital city. The population 
of the four regions together total less than nine percent of 
the total population of Djibouti. The sparse population in 
the districts is an excellent indicator of the 
underdevelopment of the outlying regions, which in return 
reveals the major impetus for the majority of the population 
to seek subsistence in the capital city. 
 
4. (U) In general, the districts\' output in the national economy 
is very low. Rarely do products go from the regions to the 
capital. On the contrary, most of the needs of the 
district\'s population are brought from the capital city, 
Djibouti-ville. Until recently, there was no industry or 
manufacturing present outside the capital. In 2004, the 
government began projects to bring manufacturing and 
production to the district of Ali-Sabieh in order to court 
political favor. A water bottling plant was inaugurated in 
early 2004 and a cement production facility has started. To 
date, the production level of these two plants has been 
negligible. 
 
5. (U) Extreme poverty, unemployment and access to potable water 
of utmost concern for most of the district residents. 
Unemployment rates range from 61 percent in Obock and 
Tadjourah to 71 percent in Ali-Sabieh, the same district 
that hosted the three biggest public and semi-public 
investments in the districts during recent years. Despite 
some recent investment in the districts, there has not been 
a strategy to ensure the local population is benefiting from 
jobs created by the new ventures. Even among districts, the 
disparity of employment opportunities is growing. All recent 
investments have been centered on the southern districts of 
the country, due to its rich soil and unpredictable 
political leanings. Little government attention has been 
directed toward the northern region, and as a result there 
are no viable jobs available in these districts. Most 
northern residents eke out a living in the struggling 
fishing industry or subsist as goat, camel or sheep herders 
and as small-scale farmers of date palms or vegetables. 
Poverty is not declining in the regions despite the 
establishment of civil society organizations that claim to 
struggle against it. 
 
5. (U) Even with a massive national effort to spread employment 
opportunities across the districts, serious obstacles 
confront any attempts at progress. One of the most-dire 
needs in all of the districts is water. Nearly 47 percent of 
the inhabitants of Tadjourah do not have access to potable 
drinking water. The same is true for 27.5 percent of the 
population of Obock; 21 percent of Dikhil and 5.5 percent of 
Ali-Sabieh. The amount of the total family budget spent on 
food is nearly 70 percent in all four of the districts. Most 
people who live outside the city feel it is useless to talk 
of economic opportunities or progress until their most basic 
needs can be assured. 
 
6. (U) Access to health care and education are also severely 
lacking in most areas of the country outside the capital 
city. In each region, there is one health center and one 
primary education establishment, located in the district 
capital. Primary education is compulsory but access to 
schools is very difficult. In the country as a whole, the 
current education system has the physical capacity to 
accommodate only 30 percent of school-aged children. The 
primary education rate in the districts is roughly the same 
in all four regions, ranging between 55 and 60 percent. The 
percentage of children that go on to secondary school is 
significantly lower due mainly to the necessity for children 
to go to the capital to study the university preparatory or 
vocational curriculums. 
 
7. (U) Daily lifestyle well-illustrates wealth in Djiboutian 
society. For those in the capital city, and those in the 
districts that are not nomadic, home-ownership is the main 
indicator of wealth. For the nomadic portion of the 
population, wealth rests with the size of the herd. Nomads 
value their animals in a hierarchy. The goat, which provides 
milk and meat for the family, is the most valued, followed 
in descending order by cows, sheep and camels. If all the 
country\'s wealth were measured by housing, Obock would be 
the poorest district with only 575 houses for an estimated 
population of 3,200 people. Under this measure, the two 
richest districts would be the southern district of Ali- 
Sabieh (2969 houses for 18,500 people) and Dikhil (2829 for 
19,592 people). 
 
8. (U) The economic activities of the different districts have a 
common base in agricultural subsistence. However, the extent 
of agriculture practiced and the variety of other activities 
possible depend upon the district. Activities in the 
northern regions, which have drier climate but abundant 
coastline, are concentrated around fishing. The northern 
district of Tadjourah also has two tourist sites that 
generate small amount of income. The southern districts have 
comparatively fertile soil, which leads many to concentrate 
their activities in farming and herding. Raising livestock 
is a major activity for the nomads in the southern region. 
Its success is by genetic mixing of the herds caused when 
livestock from Somaliland pass through the region in search 
of grazing. Although Dikhil is the less-fertile southern 
district, it has a history of being comparatively wealthy, 
thanks to smuggling. Dikhil was once the hub for all 
smuggled goods coming from Ethiopia and in the early 1980\'s, 
was the most flourishing region, after the capital. However, 
in recent years, the smuggling operations have shifted their 
focus to the Djibouti-Somaliland border and the smuggling in 
Dikhil has decreased. In absence of smuggling, the district 
of Dikhil has quickly become one of the poorest regions of 
Djibouti. 
---------- 
POLITICS 
---------- 
 
9. (U) The population in the four districts has few political 
expectations from elected officials. Each district is more 
focused on basic needs than on political maneuverings. In 
Ali-Sabieh the issue is water scarcity, which prevents 
development of any kind. (Note: Water scarcity is one of the 
biggest challenges everywhere in the country, including the 
capital city. End note). The district of Dikhil is concerned 
primarily with women\'s health and the availability of 
veterinarians (since the district\'s livelihood is derived 
mainly from livestock). Health problems and lack of road 
connections, especially with Ethiopia, remain the biggest 
challenge for Tadjourah in its search for development. The 
population of Obock is seeking water and rehabilitation of 
roads to connect Obock with Eritrea and the other cities 
within Djibouti to improve quality of life. 
 
10. (U) The regional councils are responsible for all matters 
concerning the wellbeing of each district\'s population. They 
are currently appointed by the central government, are 
comprised of 14 members and are headed by the District 
Commissar (DC). The councils each have a budget of 50 
million FD (280 000 USD), which is currently supplied by the 
central treasury. The DC heads the provisional regional 
council, controls law enforcement agents, and has command of 
military forces assigned to the district. He also signs 
birth certificates and conducts primary immigration 
investigations. The DC is not autonomous, however.  He is a 
servant of the ruling party and his investigations are often 
directed by the central administration. The role of the DC 
is much more significant as elections approach because of 
his duties as the subordinate of the Ministry of Interior. 
He gives primary authorization to identity cards and can 
approve ad hoc voting cards. Once implemented, the new 
decentralization law will restrain functions of the DC and 
limit has portfolio to merely a representative of the State. 
The administrative and financial control of the regions will 
be turned over to elected regional councils. 
 
11. (U) Two tribes predominate Djibouti\'s social and political 
scene. The northern districts, Tadjourah and Obock, are 
inhabited by Afars. Ali-Sabieh is comprised mainly of Issas. 
Dikhil is a rare combination of all national communities: 
Afar, Issa, Arabs and others. For this reason it is called 
the \"Town of Unity\". The Issa community is generally viewed 
as more open to modernization, while the more traditional 
Afars are often considered more reluctant to change. 
 
12. (U) In order to analyze the potential outcomes for the 2005 
presidential elections, it helps to examine details from the 
most recent elections: 
 
Ali-Sabieh: In the presidential election of 1999, Moussa Ahmed 
Idriss opposed Ismail Omar Guelleh. Guelleh won the 
elections by 74 percent; however, the majority in Ali-Sabieh 
voted against Guelleh\'s ruling party, an unprecedented case 
in Djibouti elections\' history. One explanation for this 
might be that the district is known as \"rebellious,\" and has 
a general dislike for directives coming from the capital. 
Because of this, Ali-Sabieh is considered by politicians to 
be unpredictable and problematic. This might be one of the 
reasons the political power focuses development projects in 
that area, over other regions. The tribal composition of Ali- 
Sabieh may also be a factor. The majority of Ali-Sabieh 
inhabitants are Issa, sub-clan Fourlaba. This sub-clan is 
known to be the most forceful rival to Mamassan sub-clan, to 
which Guelleh\'s family belongs. In 1999, Guelleh\'s rival, 
Moussa Ahmed Idriss -- an Issa, but not a Mamassan -- 
succeeded in winning the vote in Ali Sabieh. 
 
Tadjourah: In the legislative elections of 2003, the opposition 
Union for Democratic Alternance (UAD) coalition made its 
strongest showing in Tadjourah. The UAD scored 18 bureaus 
out of 27, winning nearly all the Tadjourah-ville vote, as 
well as that of some of big villages of the district. The 
Minister of the Interior explained that the Guelleh- 
coalition won the district, nevertheless, because the nine 
bureaus it won were theoretically the most populous. 
 
Dikhil: Dikhil generally votes on the side of the ruling party in 
both presidential and legislative elections. As a peaceful 
and quiet district where Afars, Issas and other communities 
get along well with each other, it has thus far been adverse 
to conflict and has in the past voted in favor of the ruling 
party. 
 
Obock: Obock is unpredictable, as it does not belong to one 
particular Afar community. The district of Obock was the 
hometown of the late Ahmed Dini, a popular opposition leader 
who was exiled from Djibouti for 22-years1. Life in the 
region is difficult, with poverty so firmly established that 
voters do not believe their situation will change, no matter 
the promises made during campaigns. That makes the region 
more likely to vote against the ruling party than in other 
districts, as in the 2003 legislative election, where the 
UAD scored highly, walking off with most of the votes cast. 
13. (U) In conclusion, the political leanings of the districts 
are fluid depending, on each administration\'s promises and 
the level of discontent among the people at any given point 
in time. In that regard, no standardized prediction f 
district leanings in the 2005 presidential election can be 
made. 
 
14. (U) Khartoum minimize considered.

SUBJECT: Outreach in Djibouti -- Out of Step with Needs? 
 
1.(U) This is an action request; see paragraph 10. 
 
2. (U) SUMMARY: The lack of resources to address English 
language education is a serious detriment to public outreach 
in Djibouti. An extremely weak civil society and lack of 
technology limits Post\'s ability to pair with local partners 
for the reliable and successful administration of existing 
Department of State English language programs. A critical 
key to public outreach in this country, across class, tribe 
and gender, is English language education. Unfortunately, 
Embassy Djibouti is currently ill equipped to address this 
need on a large scale. END SUMMARY 
 
3. (U) While Djibouti is considered an ally in the War on 
Terror and a moderate nation, it is also 99 percent Muslim, 
an Arab League Member and rated \"high\" by the US government 
for transnational terrorism. It has porous borders and is 
located in the infamously rough neighborhood of the Horn of 
Africa, which also includes Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, 
Yemen and Sudan. More than 50 percent of Djibouti\'s 
population is under the age of 25, and 40 percent of its 
citizens live below the poverty line. The country has seen 
an increase in Wahabbist activity and influence since 
independence from France in 1977 and is in need of effective 
outreach. 
 
4. (U) Although there are tribal, ethnic and class 
divisions, a unifying feature of Djiboutian society is the 
desire to learn English, which is considered the language of 
the world market and the key to relations with most other 
nations. Contacts have noted that even most regional 
business is conducted in English, due to differences in 
Arabic dialects and the country\'s geographic isolation from 
other Francophone countries. An unofficial poll at Post 
found officers have been approached about English language 
education from an astounding range of sources, including 
officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, police 
officers, members of the Chamber of Commerce, herders in 
villages, high school students and even a khat seller on the 
street. 
 
5. (U) There is no formal system for learning English in 
Djibouti.  The English teachers who do exist often have 
language skills that do not exceed the State Department 
language rating of 1+/2, as evidenced recently during a 
workshop on teaching methods jointly organized by Post\'s 
Public Diplomacy Office and the English Teacher\'s 
Association of Djibouti. Even those who do acquire 
rudimentary English skills have difficulty advancing them, 
due to extreme poverty and a lack of scholarships or other 
financial assistance for higher education. There is no 
public library in Djibouti. 
 
6. (U) While the need for Embassy outreach via English 
language education is clear, the lack of a developed civil 
society and limited human resources at Post, pose an 
enormous challenge. While other small Posts have partner 
institutions for American Corners and other English language 
projects, Djibouti\'s weak institutions make locating 
trustworthy and reliable partners nearly impossible. The 
government, while willing to help, will not guarantee public 
access to English materials. For example, Post must 
regularly visit the country\'s only university to ensure that 
library materials we have donated are available for student 
use. Frequently we find them locked away and inaccessible 
and must appeal to the school administration to unlock the 
library\'s doors during school hours. 
 
7. (U) Post\'s Public Diplomacy section, which is entering 
its second year of existence, has spent much of its time in 
institution building, with some notable successes. We are 
active with an English Club at the University and have 
established an English Language Laboratory there with EACTI 
funds. We have funded the start-up of the country\'s only 
independent press group, which is now publishing newspapers 
semi-regularly and in three languages. We have helped the 
English Teacher\'s Association lay the groundwork for 
financial solvency and are about to sign an American 
Corner\'s agreement with them for their newly established 
classroom space. We are in the midst of pursuing an 
International Visitors alumni group and an agreement to 
regularly air \"Connect with English,\" (a Department of State 
English teaching video series) on local television. A focus 
of 2005 is identifying partners to begin hosting English 
language conversation groups, which we hope to provide with 
native English speakers with the help of the Combined Joint 
Task Force-Horn of Africa. 
 
8. (U) In addition, other agencies at Post have addressed 
the English education question. The Department of Defense\'s 
U.S. Liaison Office has established a $300, 000 language 
laboratory for the Djiboutian military, and USAID has 
facilitated the arrival of five teachers from the 
International Foundation of Education and Self-Help (IFESH), 
who are working at various schools in the capital.  Despite 
all of our inter-agency progress, however, we believe there 
is still a long way to go. 
 
9. (U) A variation on the American Corners theme would be an 
enormously successful tool in Djibouti. However, for Post to 
have confidence that its resources were being used properly, 
and that free and open access was being provided, it would 
require that we both rent the space for the Corners and hire 
a LES to manage it. French Cooperation currently operates a 
similar and enormously successful reading room in the 
capital which has about six tables and offers French- 
language periodicals and fiction and non-fiction books. 
Djiboutians can borrow books from the reading room for a 
marginal annual fee (about $3 US for students; $8 US for 
others). The reading room services approximately 500 
Djiboutians each week, according to French Cooperation. 
COMMENT: This would also solve Post\'s need for publicly 
accessible programming space which is extremely limited now, 
due not only to security concerns but also to space 
constraints on the compound. (For example, until recently, 
our Political Officer\'s desk was located in a hallway due to 
lack of space).  END COMMENT 
 
10. (U) Action requested: Post requests a one-year grant to 
rent off-compound space for a reading room and to hire a 
temporary LES for management. At the end of the one-year 
trial the project can be evaluated for effectiveness with a 
set of criteria jointly developed by Post and Washington. If 
the project is deemed unsuccessful, resources will be 
donated to schools and local associations via the Public 
Diplomacy grants program.

SUBJECT: DECENTRALIZATION 
 
 
  REF: DJIBOUTI 31 
 
  1. (U) Summary: Decentralization has been a topic of debate in 
  Djibouti since the country\'s civil war in the early 1990\'s. At 
  that time, the disparity between regions and the capital led 
  the opposition Front for Restoration of Unity and Democracy 
  (FRUD) to take up arms against the government. The peace accord 
  between the two parties in February 2000 created a legal basis 
  for granting districts greater autonomy. Since the creation of 
  the decentralization law in 2002, the population of Djibouti 
  has eagerly awaited elections for Regional Councils. In January 
  2004, President Ismail Omar Guelleh announced that elections 
  for regional governing councils would be held before year\'s 
  end. However 2004 has come and gone without any indication of a 
  specific date for the elections. Post recently looked at 
  decentralization, using discussions with parliamentarians, 
  political opposition members and NGOs as an opportunity to 
  examine political leanings, economic issues and potential 
  outcomes of regional elections in each of Djibouti\'s four 
  districts. End summary. 
 
 
  2. (U) Decentralization has been a topic of debate on the local 
  political scene for more than a decade. It first appeared in 
  the early 1990s, as one of the main issues of the Djiboutian 
  civil war. A platform item of the Afar opposition party Front 
  for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy(FRUD) was greater 
  autonomy for the districts of Djibouti in order to alleviate 
  some of the economic and social discrepancies between the 
  districts and the capital. The issue is especially important to 
  FRUD and the northern districts, as nearly two-thirds of the 
  north is inhabited by Afars and greater autonomy of their 
  regions is seen as giving political weight in the face of 
  Djibouti\'s \"Issa supremacy.\" The ruling party\'s \"disinterest\" 
  in decentralization, among other complaints, eventually led to 
  FRUD\'s rebellion in 1992. The second, and final, peace accords 
  signed between the armed wing of FRUD and the Government in 
  February 2000 provided for the creation of a law to grant more 
  autonomy to the districts via regional councils. The National 
  Assembly wrote and passed a law forming regional councils on a 
  provisional basis for a period of two years, at which time 
  popular elections would be held to choose permanent councils 
  member. President Ismail Omar Guelleh signed this law, making 
  it official, in 2002. (Note: The Government of Djibouti sought, 
  in the Spring of 2004, U.S. and other donor financial 
  assistance to help bring about these elections. The Department 
  did not respond, but there have also been no follow up 
  inquiries from the Djiboutian government. End Note). 
 
  3. (U) Each of the four districts of Djibouti currently has a 
  provisional regional council made up of 14 government-appointed 
  members. The two-year transitional period of limited power was 
  intended to give the districts the time to learn how to govern 
  themselves. This, in theory, would make a smoother transition 
  to full governing responsibility. Each region manages a budget 
  of 50 million Djiboutian francs (280 000 USD). Each budget is a 
  grant from public funds, as none of the districts has 
  mechanisms in place to generate their own income. The general 
  sentiment is that the performance of the provisional councils 
  over the past two years has been less effective than hoped. The 
  population\'s expectations for alleviation of poverty and an 
  improved quality of life have remained unmet (reftel). 
 
  4. (U) The most significant power holder in each regional 
  council is the District Commissar (DC). The DC heads the 
  provisional regional council, controls law enforcement agents, 
  and has command of military forces assigned to the district. He 
  also signs birth certificates and conducts primary immigration 
  investigations. The DC is not autonomous. Rather, he is a 
  servant of the ruling party and his investigations are often 
  directed by the central administration. The role of the DC 
  becomes more significant as elections approach. He gives first 
  authorizations to identity cards and can approve ad hoc voting 
  cards. Once implemented, the new decentralization law will 
  restrain functions of the DC, and he will serve merely as 
  representative of the State. The administrative and financial 
  control of the regions will be turned over to the elected 
  regional councils. 
 
  5. (U) Although regional elections were promised for 2004, 
  officials are reluctant to discuss why they have yet to 
  materialize. A major concern may be the financial implications 
  of decentralization. Both government officials and experts from 
  international organizations agree that no viable autonomy can 
  be expected from regions unless a degree of financial autonomy 
  accompanies it. That would mean local authority to collect 
  direct, indirect and property taxes for the region, rather than 
  for the central government. It is not clear yet whether the 
  rate of each tax would be determined locally or by the central 
  administration. International donors such as European Union 
  said they will back the decentralization process, but no solid 
  commitments of financial support have been made. 
 
  6. (U) The decentralization division of the Ministry of 
  Interior has done studies to determine how best to implement 
  regional governance. The result, according to the Ministry, is 
  that it is necessary to improve education levels among the 
  populace before district residents will be capable of governing 
  themselves. Much of the district population remains illiterate. 
  Local governance managers should be able to meet minimum 
  standards of knowledge and awareness, the Ministry says, and 
  for the time being, these expectations are far from being 
  realized. 
 
  7. (U) Government senior officials with whom post met seem to 
  understand that participation of local governments will enhance 
  democracy; however, these officials cannot give a deadline or 
  timeframe for making decentralization a reality. In Djibouti, 
  the President currently sets policy and he remains sole 
  individual capable of moving decentralization forward. Such a 
  move could entail relinquishing some of his control over the 
  country\'s day-to-day operations. 
 
  8. (SBU) The Djiboutian government is blaming international 
  donors, especially the European Union, for delaying 
  decentralization while the opposition community accuses the 
  government of stymieing establishment of regional governments 
  to serve its own power needs. President Guelleh understands 
  that he may be unable to stem the move toward decentralization, 
  but he may want to delay the process until after the coming 
  presidential elections. Regional elections have the potential 
  to increase significantly the influence of opposition parties, 
  and a regional council that does not fully support Guelleh 
  could have tremendous effect on the outcome of presidential 
  voting in some districts. 
 
  9. (SBU) Although decentralization is a solid step toward 
  democratization and may be good for districts in the long run, 
  it is doomed to failure without additional planning. There are 
  currently no mechanisms in place to train newly elected leaders 
  and the central government has failed to budget financial 
  resources in 2005 to support regional councils.

SUBJECT: REFUGEE REPATRIATIONS IN DJIBOUTI: CHAOTIC BUT 
ACHIEVED 
 
REF: 04 DJIBOUTI 01473 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  ConOff and a USAID representative 
observed UNHCR-directed refugee repatriations November 24 in 
Djibouti.  The process was disorganized and confrontational, 
and fraud was blatant.  But in the end, the day resulted in 
511 refugees repatriated from the Ali Addeh refugee camp in 
Djibouti to northern Somalia.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) On November 24, ConOff and a USAID representative 
accompanied UNHCR and the Djiboutian National Organization 
for Assistance to Refugees and Disaster Victims (ONARS) to 
witness the repatriation of 79 refugee families (511 
individuals) to northern Somalia, the relatively politically 
stable area known as Somaliland.  They had all been living in 
the Ali Addeh refugee camp in southern Djibouti for as much 
as 15 years.  The repatriation was one of a number of such 
events designed to return all refugees to Somaliland and 
close the refugee camps in Djibouti by 2006. 
 
3.  (U) The evening before the repatriation, the refugees 
arrived at a staging area outside the city of Djibouti.  They 
had been brought in trucks, complete with all the belongings 
they were taking back to Somaliland.  At the staging area, 
the trucks were filled with the repatriation package allotted 
to each family.  The package, varying slightly based on 
family size, consisted of 9 months worth of staple foods, 
cooking utensils, sleeping mats, protective tarps, etc. 
Packages also included U.S.  dollars, which were only to be 
distributed immediately prior to departure.  Each family was 
assigned to a truck according to their destination within 
Somaliland.  One truck was left empty as a precaution in case 
any other vehicle broke down en route. 
 
4.  (U) Observers arrived shortly after 9:00am.  We observed 
men leaving the staging area &in protest8 urged on by an 
elderly leader.  They were upset that a refugee had been 
arrested the previous evening after an altercation with local 
police.  According to UNHCR representatives (translating for 
Embassy personnel) the men declared solidarity with the 
arrestee and refused to leave without him.  (Comment.  ConOff 
believes the men waited until the arrival of the observers, 
to emphasize their point.  Most of the men only went about 
100 meters down the road and then sat under a tree to wait 
for resolution. End Comment.) 
 
5.  (U) Shortly after the men left, the women began 
organizing in groups to protest the food included in the 
package.  One older woman started inciting the others, 
declaring that the flour was old.  The arguments continued 
for more than an hour, and moved to other topics such as the 
substitution of dried peas for beans (they had been promised 
beans, but only peas were available at the time.) They 
demanded more cooking oil in place of the beans.  Oil is a 
more salable commodity, translating easily to cash. 
 
6.  (U) At some point during the argument, one of the women 
revealed to UNHCR that the man arrested was not from Ali 
Addeh, and therefore not eligible to be repatriated with this 
convoy.  While this argument was taking place, UNHCR 
employees were comparing names on the list from the camp of 
individuals that had volunteered for the convoy and turned in 
their ration cards, to the pink slips that they were given in 
exchange for the ration cards.  The double-checking was to 
precede the distribution of cash.  The process brought 
significant discrepancies to light.  About 20% more pink 
slips were presented than appeared on the official lists. 
This led to another heated argument.  The head of ONARS 
accused UNHCR of incompetence in running a repatriation 
operation.  The UNHCR employees became indignant and said 
they couldn\'t control fraud, and insisted that their 
signatures had been forged on the pink slips. 
 
7.  (U) It was decided that individuals not appearing on the 
original list would not be transported with this convoy. 
Food that had been allocated to them earlier that day was now 
unloaded from the trucks and two trucks were designated to 
return those stores to the warehouse in Djibouti.  This 
caused a protest from local laborers saying they had been 
employed only to load the trucks, not unload them.  Rapid 
negotiations led to a new fee agreement, and the food was 
reallocated appropriately. 
 
8.  (U) Meanwhile, a few of the refugees, seeing the cash 
being counted, claimed the dollars were counterfeit.  The 
currency was in stacks of crisp new bank bills, and it\'s 
possible that most refugees had never seen new bills. In a 
country where bills are circulated so often they become very 
worn, new documents may be considered suspect.  However, our 
driver informed ConOff that a few savvy individuals were 
angling to get the money in Euros because of the recent weak 
exchange rate for U.S.  dollars. 
 
9.  (U) By 1:00 pm, the organizers were becoming visibly 
anxious about the delays.  The trucks, special rugged 
vehicles required for the difficult conditions, had been 
brought in from Somalia and only had permission to remain in 
Djibouti for 48 hours.  The convoy had to cross the border 
before nightfall.  The intense heat was exacerbating issues, 
as observers had not planned to spend the day at the staging 
area.  Shelter from the sun, as well as food and drinking 
water were scarce.  A decision was made to move the convoy 
immediately, and resolve remaining issues on the other side 
of the border. 
 
10.  (U) On half hour later, an announcement was made that 
the convoy was leaving, and only individuals named on the 
original list drawn up at the camp would be transported.  The 
cash would be distributed after crossing the border.  An 
intense flurry of activity immediately followed.  As soon as 
it became clear that the assigned foodstuffs were no longer 
open for negotiation (no ground appeared to have been given), 
an instant barter system sprang up, and families began 
trading their goods amongst each other, bags of peas and 
maize moved from one truck to the next, while oil, cooking 
tins or other goods moved back to yet other vehicles.  Within 
half an hour, the trucks were loaded and the convoy lined up 
to head towards Somalia. 
 
11.  (SBU) Comment.  This was the 14th repatriation to take 
place from Djibouti in 2004.  ConOff was surprised that the 
process is still so chaotic.  The system for checking 
individuals against the official list of registered 
repatriation candidates was cumbersome, and ineffective.  The 
list was not alphabetized or organized in any other method 
that ConOff could determine.  Further, the organizers did not 
seem to know how many should be on the list, and therefore, 
how much food should be provided.  The trucks that were 
loaded with repatriation packages for individuals not on the 
official list created extra confusion and wasted time and 
effort.  The idea of distributing the cash after crossing the 
border seems to have been a decision of desperation; although 
it was immensely logical given the high degree of fraud, and 
observers were amazed it hadn\'t been done that way in the 
past.  Fraud was mentioned repeatedly throughout the day. 
Past repatriations have resulted in as little as 20% of 
individuals who accepted the package of food and money 
actually crossing the border into Somalia.  According to 
UNHCR, 515 individuals did in fact cross the border this time 
and accept their money on the other side.  It remains to be 
seen how many actually stay in Somalia, and how many sell 
their packages and return to Djibouti as refugees, as illegal 
economic migrants, or as Djiboutian citizens who managed to 
defraud the refugee coordinators. End comment. 
 
13. (U) As of December, 8,086 individuals comprising 1,632 
families have been repatriated from Djibouti to Somaliland in 
14 convoys.  The total number remaining in the refugee camps 
is 13,810 (Ali Addeh: 6,955 and Holl Holl: 6,855). In 
addition, the Aour Aoussa Transit Center holds 3,775 
refugees, 3,395 of whom are from South and Central Somalia.
