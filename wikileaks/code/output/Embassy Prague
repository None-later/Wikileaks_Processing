SUBJECT: DEMONSTRATIONS IN PRAGUE AND OTHER 
         CZECHOSLOVAK CITIES NOVEMBER 20 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  THE PRAGUE 
DEMONSTRATION OF NOVEMBER 20, AT MORE THAN 150,000 
PEOPLE, WAS THE LARGEST YET.  POLICE MADE NO ATTEMPT 
TO INTERVENE OTHER THAN TO CLOSE BRIDGES TO PREVENT 
THE CROWD FROM MARCHING ON PRAGUE CASTLE. 
DEMONSTRATIONS ALSO OCCURRED IN SEVERAL OTHER 
CITIES, INCLUDING BRATISLAVA.  MEDIA COVERAGE 
REMAINED MIXED, WITH \"RUDE PRAVO\" HOSTILE, 
\"SVOBODNE SLOVO\" FAVORABLE AND TELEVISION 
COVERAGE POSITIVE -- OR AT LEAST OBJECTIVE. 
WHETHER AS A THOUGHTOUT PLAN OR THE RESULT OF 
LEADERSHIP DISAGREEMENTS, THE REGIME SEEMS TO 
HAVE ADOPTED A CARROT AND STICK STRATEGY, WITH 
SOME CONCILIATORY GESTURES AND A PROMISE OF AT 
LEAST ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS COMBINED WITH A 
NONE-TOO-VEILED WARNING OF SUPPRESSION IF THINGS 
REMAIN OUT OF HAND.  IT ALSO IS CONTINUING ITS 
EFFORTS TO TAINT DEMONSTRATORS WITH CHARGES OF 
WORKING FOR FOREIGN INTERESTS.  IT CANNOT HAVE 
BEEN PLEASED, HOWEVER, BY A SOVIET PRESS SPOKESMAN 
STATEMENT THAT DESCRIBED THE DEMONSTRATIONS AS 
PART OF THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN EASTERN 
EUROPE.  IN ANOTHER PRESUMABLE REACTION TO THE 
DEMONSTRATIONS, GDR LEADER KRENZ HAS CANCELLED 
HIS VISIT TO PRAGUE.  (NOTE:  AS THIS CABLE GOES 
TO PRESS, CZECH REPUBLIC GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN 
KASIK ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTIGATION WOULD BE 
OPENED ON THE EVENTS OF NOVEMBER 17 AND WHETHER 
THE POLICE USED DISPROPORTIONATE FORCE.  END NOTE.) 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
2.  (U)  THE DEMONSTRATION DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING YESTERDAY, NOVEMBER 20, WAS THE LARGEST YET. 
THE COMMUNIST PARTY DAILY \"RUDE 
PRAVO\" ADMITTED TO 150,000 PEOPLE, BUT EMBOFFS PRESENT 
THOUGHT IT CLOSER TO 200,000.  THE CROWD GATHERED 
SLOWLY DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND DISPERSED 
GRADUALLY IN THE EVENING.  A LAST GROUP OF SEVERAL 
THOUSAND STOOD OUTSIDE CZECHOSLOVAK RADIO AT ABOUT 
10:00 P.M. AND THEN WENT HOME.  POLICE MADE NO EFFORT 
TO INTERFERE WITH THE CROWD AS LONG AS IT STAYED WITHIN 
THE \"GOLDEN CROSS\" AREA  OF WENCESLAS SQUARE AND 
NATIONAL AVENUE.  SECURITY FORCES DID CLOSE OFF THE 
BRIDGES GOING ACROSS THE RIVER TO PREVENT THE 
DEMONSTRATORS FROM TRYING TO MARCH ON PRAGUE CASTLE. 
 
3.  (U)  THE DEMONSTRATION APPEARED TO BE UNORGANIZED AND 
LEADERLESS, AND WHILE THERE HAS BEEN NO CALL FOR A 
GATHERING TODAY ONE IS GENERALLY EXPECTED.  OTHER 
DEMONSTRATIONS OCCURRED THE SAME DAY OUTSIDE PRAGUE. 
THESE INCLUDED BRNO (AN ESTIMATED 30,000 IN THE 
CENTRAL SQUARE), OLOMOUC (6,000), TEPLICE (1,000), 
LIBEREC AND OSTRAVA.  THEATERS AND SCHOOLS WERE CLOSED 
IN CESKE BUDEJOVICE, AS WELL AS PRAGUE -- WHERE 
PERFORMERS TALKED POLITICS WITH ANY AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO 
SHOWED UP.  DEMONSTRATIONS ALSO TOOK PLACE IN 
BRATISLAVA, BUT WE HAVE HEARD OF NO OTHERS IN SLOVAKIA. 
DEMONSTRATORS IN MANY OF THESE PLACES VOICED THE 
ANTI-GOVERNMENT AND ANTI-COMMUNIST DEMANDS HEARD IN 
PRAGUE, INCLUDING SUCH SLOGANS AS \"JAKES IN THE 
WASTEBASKET.\"  TELEVISION NEWS REPORTS SAID THAT 
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF DISTURBANCES IN OTHER PRINCIPAL 
CITIES SUCH AS PLZEN AND HRADEC KRALOVE, AND 
CONDEMNED THE NOVEMBER 17 POLICE BRUTALITY. 
 
REGIME REACTION 
--------------- 
 
4.  (C) THE ONLY REGIME FIGURE TO ADDRESS THE 
DEMONSTRATORS DIRECTLY IN WENCESLAS SQUARE WAS VASIL 
MOHORITA, CHAIRMAN OF THE SOCIALIST UNION OF YOUTH 
(SSM).  HE MADE SEVERAL POINTS THAT HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN 
HIS ORGANIZATION\'S STATEMENT PUBLISHED IN \"MLADA FRONTA\" 
THE DAY BEFORE (PRAGUE 8106), IN WHICH HE SUPPORTED 
THE STUDENTS, AND HE SAID THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE ANY 
PROSECUTION OF STUDENTS ARRESTED ON NOVEMBER 17 AND 
WOULD RESIGN IF THERE WERE PROSECUTIONS.  (COMMENT: 
WE REMAIN SUSPICIOUS THAT MOHORITA\'S COMMENTS ARE 
MORE AN EFFORT TO COOPT THE STUDENTS THAN TO SUPPORT 
THEIR DEMANDS.  END COMMENT.) 
 
5.  (U)  THE CPCZ PRESIDIUM HELD A SPECIAL SESSION 
DURING THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER 20 TO TRY TO DEAL 
WITH THE SITUATION  AND WITH \"EXPRESSIONS OF INTENSE 
CONCERN\" BY VARIOUS PARTY AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 
IT REJECTED STUDENT APPEALS FOR A GENERAL STRIKE 
NOVEMBER 27 AND CALLED ON STUDENTS TO RETURN TO CLASS 
AND ARTISTS TO RETURN TO WORK.  IT ALSO REPORTEDLY 
DISCUSSED PRACTICAL STEPS FOR RESTORING ORDER, AND 
SUPPORTED A JOINT STATEMENT RELEASED BY THE FEDERAL, 
CZECH AND SLOVAK GOVERNMENTS. 
 
6.  (C)  THIS STATEMENT, ENTITLED \"DIALOGUE YES, 
CONFRONTATION NO,\" INSISTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAD BEEN STRIVING FOR SOCIAL RESTRUCTURING AND 
DEMOCRACY AS WELL AS IMPROVING LIVING STANDARDS, 
GOING INTO SOME DETAIL ON THE LATTER POINT.  IT 
EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE CURRENT DISTURBANCES 
SINCE THESE \"ONLY PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO 
OPPOSE RESTRUCTURING.\"  THE GOVERNMENT WANTED A 
DIALOGUE AND A POLITICAL SOLUTION OF EXISTING 
PROBLEMS, BUT SUCH A SOLUTION \"CANNOT BE FOUND IN 
AN ATMOSPHERE OF EMOTION AND ANTI-SOCIALIST 
MANIFESTATIONS.\"  WHILE THE GOVERNMENT \"DID NOT WANT 
TO GO VIA A PATH OF CONFRONTATION WHICH THE ANTI- 
SOCIALIST ELEMENTS ARE TRYING TO FORCE ON US,\" IT COULD 
NOT AGREE TO THE VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE 
LAWS OF THE LAND OR \"WATCH HELPLESSLY ACTIVITIES OF 
THOSE GROUPS WHICH ACT AT VARIANCE WITH THE 
CZECHOSLOVAK LEGAL ORDER AND ARE INCITED FROM ABROAD.\" 
THUS ALL THREE GOVERNMENTS SUPPORTED THE MEASURES 
WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN TO KEEP ORDER.  (COMMENT: 
PRESUMABLY A REFERENCE TO SUPPRESSION OF THE NOVEMBER 17 
DEMONSTRATIONS AND A WARNING THAT SUCH ACTION COULD 
COME AGAIN IF NEEDED.  END COMMENT.) 
 
7.  (U) PRAGUE CITY PARTY CHAIRMAN MIROSLAV STEPAN, 
MEANWHILE, MET WITH CPCZ PARTY WORKERS OF THE MAJOR 
PRAGUE ENTERPRISES NOVEMBER 20 TO RALLY SUPPORT IN 
A PROBABLE EFFORT TO HEAD OFF A NOVEMBER 27 GENERAL 
STRIKE.  HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNISTS 
NOT BEING NEUTRAL IN THE CURRENT EVENTS AND TO OPPOSE 
THOSE FORCES WHO WANTED ALL OR NOTHING (I.E., WHO WERE 
NOT INTERESTED IN DIALOGUE OR COMPROMISE) AND STAND 
FIRM AGAINST EVENTS NOW GOING ON IN THE CITY. 
 
8.  (U) IN A REACTION FROM THE SOVIET UNION, SOVIET 
PRESS SPOKESMAN GERASIMOV WAS SHOWN ON CZECHOSLOVAK 
TELEVISION SAYING THAT THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE AN 
INTERNAL MATTER FOR CZECHOSLOVAKIA, BUT THAT THEY 
REPRESENTED A PART OF THE CURRENT PROCESS OF 
DEMOCRATIZATION IN EASTERN EUROPE.  PRESUMABLY IN 
RESPONSE TO EVENTS IN PRAGUE, GRD LEADER KRENZ 
CANCELLED HIS NOVEMBER 21 VISIT TO PRAGUE AFTER 
MUTUAL AGREEMENT WITH THE GOC. 
 
MEDIA REACTION 
-------------- 
 
9.  (U) \"RUDE PRAVO\" IS STICKING TO A LINE CRITICAL OF 
THE DEMONSTRATORS, PUBLISHING INTERVIEWS WITH WORKERS 
AND PARTY MEMBERS HOSTILE TO THE DEMONSTRATIONS AND 
SUGGESTING THAT SOME OF THE ORGANIZERS OF THE 
DEMONSTRATIONS ARE NOT STUDENTS.  IT LIMITED ITS 
COVERAGE OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS TO PRAGUE AND BRNO, 
WITHOUT MENTIONING THAT ANY HAD TAKEN PLACE 
ELSEWHERE. 
 
10.  (U) THE SOCIALIST PARTY PAPER \"SVOBODNE SLOVO,\" 
HOWEVER, REMAINED GENERALLY SYMPATHETIC TO THE 
DEMONSTRATIONS (PRAGUE 8106).  IT ALSO REPORTED 
THAT 400 JOURNALISTS HAD MET NOVEMBER 20 AND 
REJECTED THE POLICE ACTIONS ON NOVEMBER 17, AS WELL AS 
MAINTENANCE OF THE LEADING ROLE OF THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY.  THE JOURNALISTS SUPPORTED THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED 
INDEPENDENT CIVIC FORUM (PRAGUE 8108) AND CALLED UPON 
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CZECH JOURNALISTS\' UNION TO DO 
THE SAME OR RESIGN.  THEY ALSO CREATED AN OFFICIAL 
GROUP OF INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS. 
 
11.  (U) CZECHOSLOVAK TELEVISION COVERAGE WAS GENERALLY 
POSITIVE, OR AT LEAST OBJECTIVE.  IN ADDITION TO 
COVERAGE OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS IN PRAGUE AND OTHER 
CITIES, THERE WERE INTERVIEWS WITH THE STUDENTS AND 
OTHER DEMONSTRATORS, GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO PRESENT 
THEIR VIEWS TO A NATIONAL AUDIENCE.

SUBJECT: LOCAL SOVIET VIEW OF CZECHOSLOVAK 
         DEVELOPMENTS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  IN NOVEMBER 28 CONVERSATION WITH 
SOVIET COUNTERPART, DCM WAS TOLD THAT USE OF FORCE 
OR INTERVENTION OF CZECHOSLOVAK MILITARY IN POLITICAL 
SITUATION HERE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.  SOVIET 
EMBASSY EXPECTED AND IS RELAXED ABOUT CHANGES HERE, 
BUT WANTS TO SEE SOCIALISM PRESERVED.  THEY WOULD 
BE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS HERE WHICH 
SUGGEST \"ANTI-SOVIETISM.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN CONVERSATION WITH SOVIET DCM, MARAT KUZNECOV, 
AT YUGOSLAV NATIONAL DAY RECEPTION NOVEMBER 28, 
DCM WAS TOLD THAT SOVIET EMBASSY IS CONVINCED 
THAT \"NO MORE BATONS\" WILL BE USED HERE AND THAT 
THE CZECHOSLOVAK MILITARY WILL NOT RPT NOT INTERVENE 
IN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS.  KUZNECOV SERVED 
PREVIOUSLY IN BRATISLAVA AND WAS IN PRAGUE IN 
1968. 
 
4.  KUZNECOV SAID THAT SOVIET EMBASSY WAS AWARE 
THAT THERE WOULD BE CHANGE HERE AND AGREED THAT THERE 
SHOULD BE A MORE \"HUMAN\" APPROACH TO BUILDING SOCIALISM 
IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  HE THOUGHT IT NOTEWORTHY AND, BY 
IMPLICATION, POSITIVE THAT DUBCEK IN A WEEKEND ADDRESS 
IN PRAGUE HAD QUOTED GORBACHEV AS USING THE TERM 
(WHICH DUBCEK HIMSELF COINED IN 1968), \"SOCIALISM 
WITH A HUMAN FACE.\"  HE SAID THERE WILL CERTAINLY 
BE A SERIOUS DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION, BUT SAID 
HE INVARIABLY REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA. 
 
5.  ASKED WHETHER THE SOVIET EMBASSY IS RELAXED 
ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS HERE,KUZNECOV REPLIED THAT THE 
EMBASSY IS WATCHING CLOSELY TO SEE THAT CERTAIN 
OPPOSITION ELEMENTS DO NOT FOSTER A SPIRIT OF 
ANTI-SOVIETISM.  THE USSR WANTS SOCIALISM TO BE 
MAINTAINED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  THE NEW CZECHOSLOVAK 
COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP HAS PEOPLE IN IT WHO 
RECOGNIZE THAT THE 1968 PARTY PROGRAM HAD MANY 
GOOD ELEMENTS FOR BUILDING SOCIALISM.  WHEN DCM 
REMARKED THAT THERE WERE VARIOUS DEFINITIONS OF 
SOCIALISM AND THAT GORBACHEV\'S NOVEMBER 26 PRAVDA 
INTERVIEW (MOSCOW 33157) CONFIRMED THIS TO BE THE 
CASE, KUZNECOV SMILED BROADLY AND NODDED.  HOWEVER, 
HE SIMPLY REITERATED THAT IT IS IN THE SOVIET 
INTEREST TO KEEP CZECHOSLOVAKIA SOCIALIST AND TO 
AVOID ANTI-SOVIET AND ANTI-COMMUNIST SENTIMENTS. 
 
6.  KUZNECOV WAS MORE RELAXED AND FRIENDLY THAN 
USUAL AND JOKED THAT THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR HAD 
JUST BEEN PRESSING HIM, UNSUCCESSFULLY, FOR HIS 
VIEWS ON WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN HERE.  HE FIRST CHARACTERIZED 
THE SITUATION AS REFLECTING \"TENSION\" (NAPETI), 
BUT QUICKLY AGREED THAT \"DIFFICULT\" OR \"COMPLEX\" 
MIGHT BE BETTER TERMS AND THAT THERE WAS NO \"TENSION\" 
IN THE SENSE OF POSSIBLE USE OF VIOLENCE OR FORCE. 
HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE POSITIVE ASPECT OF DEVELOP- 
MENTS HERE INVOLVED A MORE \"HUMAN\" APPROACH TO 
SOCIALISM.  HOWEVER, HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE SOVIET 
POSITION IS THAT THEY WILL NOT INTERFERE IN THE 
INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES.

          PROSPECTS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  CZECHOSLVOAKIA\'S \"QUIET\" 
REVOLUTION, WITH THE CIVIC FORUM IN ITS 
VANGUARD, HAS REALLY ONLY JUST BEGUN, BUT IT 
HAS REACHED AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE IN FORCING 
THE REGIME TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE.  THE FORUM\'S 
REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT  UNDERESTIMATE THE LONG 
FIGHT AHEAD BEFORE THE LEGAL AND TACTICAL 
ROADBLOCKS THE CPCZ WILL PUT IN THE WAY OF 
ACHIEVING SUCH GOALS AS FREE ELECTIONS CAN BE 
OVERCOME AND THE PRESENT TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM 
CAN BE  GRADUALLY TRANSFORMED INTO A 
PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A NON-VIOLENT REVOLUTION 
------------------------ 
 
3.  WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA OVER 
THE PAST 12 DAYS IS NOTHING SHORT OF A POPULAR 
REVOLUTION, BUT A NON-VIOLENT ONE.  IT IS A 
REVOLUTION SPARKED BY STUDENTS AND ARTISTS IN 
REACTION TO THE BRUTAL SUPPRESSION ON NOVEMBER 
17 OF A STUDENT DEMONSTRATION AND THEN JOINED 
BY WORKERS AND THE GREAT MASS OF THE PEOPLE. 
LIKE THE PRAGUE SPRING OF 1968, THIS REVOLUTION 
HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE GRADUAL LOSS OF FEAR BY 
THE MAN IN THE STREET OF REGIME REPRESSION, 
BUT DIFFERS FROM 1968 IN THAT IT ORIGINATED 
FROM WITHIN THE YOUNGER GENERATION AND NOT SO 
MUCH FROM REFORM ELEMENTS WITHIN THE CPCZ.  IT 
THUS IS MORE OF A REJECTION OF THE 41 YEARS 
OF THE COUNTRY\'S COMMUNIST PAST. 
 
THE FORUM:  A LOOSE COALITION 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  BUT IF THIS REVOLUTION BEGAN SPONTANEOUSLY, ITS 
POPULAR FOCAL POINT QUICKLY BECAME THE \"CIVIC FORUM,\" 
SYMBOLIZED BY PLAYWRIGHT VACLAV HAVEL.  THE FORUM 
HAS ARTICULATED POPULAR DEMANDS BUT DECLINED BECOMING 
A POLITICAL PARTY.  ITS GREATEST SUCCESS, SO FAR, HAS BEEN 
IN MOBILIZING MASS DEMONSTRATIONS AND SUPPORT FOR A 
GENERAL STRIKE.  THESE TOPPLED THE OLD COMMUNIST 
PARTY LEADERSHIP AND FORCED THE GOVERNMENT (AND THE 
PARTY STANDING BEHIND IT) RELUCTANTLY INTO A DIALOGUE. 
 
5.  THE FORUM\'S REPRESENTATIVES ARE CAREFUL NOT TO 
EXAGGERATE THE CONCESSIONS, SPECIFICALLY AN END TO 
THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY\'S \"LEADING 
ROLE,\" THAT THIS DIALOGUE HAS PRODUCED UP TO NOW. 
THE FORUM\'S OBJECTIVES ARE MUCH BROADER.  IT WANTS 
NOTHING LESS THAN TO PREPARE THE GROUNDWORK FOR FREE 
ELECTIONS AND CONVERSION OF THE PRESENT 
TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM TO DEMOCRACY.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE REGIME TO ACHIEVE THIS HAVE ONLY 
BEGUN; THAT THEY WILL BE COMPLEX.  EVEN AFTER THE 
GOVERNMENT PRODUCES A NEW COALITION OF \"EXPERTS\" ON 
DECEMBER 3 AS PRIME MINISTER ADAMEC HAS PROMISED, THE 
FORUM EXPECTS DELAYING TACTICS, PROVOCATIONS AND 
ATTEMPTS TO PLAY ON ITS INTERNAL DIVISIONS. 
 
6.  THOSE DIVISIONS ARE VERY REAL.  REPRESENTED WITHIN 
THE FORUM ARE POLITICAL GROUPINGS THAT RANGE FROM 
REFORM COMMUNIST (THE RENEWAL GROUP) TO LIBERAL 
(THE DEMOCRATIC INITIATIVE).  SLOVAKS ARE REPRESENTED 
BY THEIR OWN SEPARATE PRO-DEMOCRACY ORGANIZATION, 
THE PUBLIC AGAINST VIOLENCE.  STUDENT GROUPS WHICH 
BEGAN THE STRIKE FOR CHANGE SEEM IRRITATED THAT THE 
FORUM HAS TAKEN OVER THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT 
FROM THEM.  WORKERS, AFTER FLEXING THEIR MUSCLES IN THE 
NOVEMBER 27 GENERAL STRIKE, SEEM READIER TO SUPPORT 
MORE INDUSTRIAL ACTION THAN THE INTELLECTUALS AND 
PROFESSIONALS HEADING THE FORUM. 
 
7.  THE FORUM IS TRYING TO PLAY THESE DIVISIONS DOWN 
BY EMPHASIZING ITS TRANSITIONAL, NON-POLITICAL 
CHARACTER AND BY KEEPING ITS SUPPORTERS\' ATTENTION 
ON ITS LONGER TERM GOALS FOR SOCIETY:  A MIXED 
ECONOMY, A PLURALISTIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND 
CZECHOSLOVAKIA\'S INTEGRATION INTO WESTERN EUROPE. 
INTERESTINGLY, THE FORUM\'S SEVEN CHAPTER PROGRAM 
STATEMENT (PRAGUE 8312) NOT ONCE MENTIONS THE WORD 
\"SOCIALISM.\" 
 
THE COMMUNIST PARTY, DOWN BUT NOT OUT 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.  IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS OF THIS REVOLUTION, THE 
CPCZ\' AUTHORITY AND CONTROL OF SOCIETY HAS BEEN 
ENORMOUSLY ERODED.  INTERNAL SPLITS HAVE DEVELOPED. 
A REFORM-MINDED PARTY GROUP HAS SET UP THE 
\"DEMOCRATIC FORUM,\" CALLING FOR A RE-EVALUATION OF 
1968 AND RE-ADMISSION OF PURGED PRAGUE SPRING 
FIGURES.  THE ELIMINATION OF PARTY CONTROL OVER THE 
MEDIA HAS BEEN DRAMATIC, AS TELEVISION AND RADIO NEWS- 
CASTERS OVERNIGHT BEGAN TO FUNCTION LIKE THEIR 
WESTERN COUNTERPARTS.  THE PARTY HAS FORESWORN USE 
OF FORCE IN A CENTRAL COMMITTEE RESOLUTION, THOUGH 
QUALIFYING THIS COMMITMENT BY REFERRING TO A NEED 
TO DEFEND LIFE, PROPERTY AND \"THE FUNDAMENTALS OF 
SOCIALISM.\" 
 
9.  ALTHOUGH REELING, THE PARTY IS NOT A SPENT 
FORCE, HOWEVER, AND IT WILL NOT WILLINGLY 
COMMIT POLITICAL SUICIDE BY MOVING TO FREE 
ELECTIONS.  IN A SPEECH ON NOVEMBER 28, THE 
NEW GENERAL SECRETARY KAREL URBANEK HAS CALLED 
ON HIS CADRES TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE AND SEEK 
TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE NOW LARGELY REFORM- 
MINDED MEDIA.  HE HAS REJECTED RECENT CALLS BY 
THE FORUM TO ABOLISH THE PEOPLE\'S MILITIA, 
REMOVE PARTY FIGURES AS FACTORY MANAGERS AND 
ELIMINATE BASIC PARTY ORGANIZATIONS IN 
ENTERPRISES.  URBANEK PLANS TO TRAVEL TO MOSCOW 
IN EARLY DECEMBER AND WILL CERTAINLY BE SEEKING 
SOME SIGN OF GORBACHEV\'S SUPPORT FOR HIS PARTY 
AND ITS FUTURE. 
 
10.  DESPITE ITS DISARRAY, THE CPCZ STILL HOLDS 
SOME STRONG CARDS.  THE PARTY STILL DOMINATES 
IMPORTANT SOCIETAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE 
SECURITY FORCES, AND STILL IS THE PREDOMINANT 
FORCE IN THE NATIONAL FRONT, AND WILL CONTINUE 
TO BE SO EVEN AFTER ITS LEGAL BASIS FOR THAT 
CONTROL IS ELIMINATED.  IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT 
THE REGIME HAS CHOSEN THE FRONT AS THE FRAMEWORK 
FOR DIALOGUE WITH THE CIVIC FORUM, THEREBY 
TRYING TO PRESENT THE FORUM AS THE \"OPPOSITION\" 
TO ESTABLISHED, PARTY-CONTROLLED INSTITUTIONS. 
 
 
WHERE THE REVOLUTION IS HEADED 
------------------------------ 
 
11.  VALTR KOMAREK, AN ECONOMIST TOUTED BY SOME AS 
POSSIBLE MINISTERIAL CANDIDATE IN A NEW COALITION 
GOVERNMENT, WAS ASKED THIS WEEK HOW LONG IT WOULD 
TAKE CZECHOSLOVAKIA TO CONVERT INTO A WESTERN-STYLE 
DEMOCRACY.  HE RESPONDED THAT THE COUNTRY DID NOT NEED 
TO RECEIVE DEMOCRACY IN DRIBS AND DRABS; THE PEOPLE 
COULD SWALLOW IT WHOLE.  IF THE COMMUNISTS CAN BE 
FORCED TO LET THE COUNTRY\'S LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS 
CONFORM TO THE PEOPLE\'S WILL, HE SAID, CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
COULD RESUME ITS REFORMIST, DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS 
ALMOST OVERNIGHT.  THAT IS AN ASSESSMENT THE 
EMBASSY SHARES. 
 
 
12.  THE  BRAKE ON THIS TRANSITION WILL BE THE 
ONE APPLIED BY THE PRESENT REGIME\'S LEADERSHIP AS 
IT MANEUVERS TO DELAY THE DATE OF REFORMS, 
PARTICULARLY FREE ELECTIONS.  THE REGIME HAS A NUMBER 
OF ROADBLOCKS, POLITICAL AND LEGAL, IT CAN PUT IN THE 
WAY.  AS GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY, 
JAN SKODA, HAS POINTED OUT TO US, MOVING UP THE 
DATE OF ELECTIONS WILL REQUIRE A TWO-THIRDS VOTE 
OF THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY.  THIS IS SOMETHING THE 
ASSEMBLY, A MAJORITY OF WHOSE MEMBERS ARE COMMUNIST 
AND LIKELY TO BE VOTED OUT, MAY  BE UNREADY TO AGREE 
TO.  HOWEVER, THE CZECH AND SLOVAK TENDENCY TOWARDS 
CONSENSUS AND LOSS OF LEGITIMACY BY THE CPCZ 
HIERARCHY SUGGEST THAT PARLIAMENTARIANS AS WELL 
AS OTHER FUNCTIONARIES WILL MOVE RAPIDLY TO 
SHOW \"REFORMIST\" COLORS. 
 
13.  QUICK ELECTIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN THE CIVIC 
FORUM\'S INTEREST.  MANY OF THE POLITICAL GROUPS IT 
REPRESENTS ARE ONLY IN AN EMBRYONIC STATE AND WILL 
NEED MORE TIME TO ORGANIZE.  IN THE MEANTIME, AS 
THE FORUM\'S LIST OF DEMANDS SUBMITTED TO ADAMEC ON 
NOVEMBER 28 (SEPTEL) INDICATES, IT WILL FOCUS ON 
THE PERSONNEL AND LEGAL CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM 
NECESSARY TO ASSURE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION 
TOWARDS DEMOCRACY.

SUBJECT:  THE CZECH CONSTITUTION 
 
REF: FBIS VIENNA AU, SERIAL NO. AU2412060192 (NOTAL) 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  THE CZECH REPUBLIC (CR) CONSTITUTION (FULL 
TEXT REFTEL), WHICH WILL TAKE EFFECT JANUARY 1, IS 
EXPLICITLY PART OF THE CR\'S EFFORT TO PROJECT ITSELF 
RAPIDLY AND FULLY INTO THE \"FAMILY OF EUROPEAN AND WORLD 
DEMOCRACIES.\"  THE FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUENT UNIT IS NOT 
THE CZECH PEOPLE AS A GROUP, BUT RATHER THE INDIVIDUAL 
CITIZEN OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC, WHOSE HUMAN AND CIVIL 
RIGHTS ARE ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED AND PROTECTED BY AN 
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, INCLUDING A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT 
AND SUPREME COURT.  THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE 
PROTECTION OF MINORITY VIEWPOINTS, BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE 
THE PRINCIPLE THAT NATIONAL OR ETHNIC MINORITIES HAVE 
SPECIAL RIGHTS BY VIRTUE OF THEIR NATIONAL OR ETHNIC 
DISTINCTIVENESS. 
 
2.  THE INDEPENDENT CZECH REPUBLIC WILL BE A 
PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, WITH A BICAMERAL LEGISLATURE 
(CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND SENATE).  THE PRIME MINISTER, 
HIS DEPUTIES, AND OTHER MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THE 
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  A MAJOR FUNCTION OF THE SENATE IS 
TO ENSURE CONTINUITY WHEN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES CANNOT 
FULFILL ITS RESPONSIBILITIES; OTHERWISE, IT IS FAR LESS 
POWERFUL THAN THE CHAMBER.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
REPUBLIC IS ELECTED BY BOTH CHAMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, AND 
EXERCISES POWERS SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER THAN THOSE OF THE 
GERMAN PRESIDENT, BUT LESS THAN THOSE OF THE PRESIDENT 
OF FRANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, 
AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES, THE CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES A 
SUPREME INSPECTION OFFICE (SOMEWHAT COMPARABLE TO THE 
GAO) AND THE CZECH NATIONAL BANK.  THE CONSTITUTION ALSO 
PROVIDES FOR WHAT IS TERMED \"TERRITORIAL 
SELF-ADMINISTRATION\" AT THE LEVEL OF MUNICIPALITIES AND 
OF REGIONS OR LANDS, BUT DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE 
MUNICIPAL OR REGIONAL AUTONOMY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BASIC PRINCIPLES 
---------------- 
 
3.  ACCORDING TO THE PREAMBLE, IT IS THE \"CITIZENS OF 
THE CZECH REPUBLIC IN BOHEMIA, MORAVIA, AND SILESIA\" WHO 
ADOPT THE CONSTITUTION, THROUGH THEIR FREELY ELECTED 
REPRESENTATIVES.  THE PREAMBLE AND CHAPTER ONE, \"BASIC 
PROVISIONS,\" REFER AT SEVERAL POINTS TO THE CR AS A 
\"STATE OF LAWS\", BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF ALL CITIZENS 
AND RESPECT FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN DIGNITY, 
FREEDOM, AND HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS.  INTERNATIONAL 
ACCORDS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS TO 
WHICH THE CR HAS COMMITTED ITSELF ARE BINDING AND TAKE 
PRECEDENCE OVER NATIONAL LAW, AND THE 
POST-VELVET-REVOLUTION CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND 
FREEDOMS IS DEFINED AS PART OF THE \"CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER 
OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC.\"  THE CONSTITUTION FORBIDS ANY 
CHANGES IN THE ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE CR AS A 
DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAWS, AND FORBIDS THE INTERPRETATION 
OF LEGAL NORMS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO THREATEN THE 
FOUNDATIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE. 
 
4.  ALL STATE POWER DERIVES FROM THE PEOPLE, AND THE 
POWER OF THE STATE IS DEFINED AS SERVING ALL CITIZENS. 
THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS BASED ON FREE COMPETITION OF 
POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH MUST RESPECT FUNDAMENTAL 
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND REJECT FORCE AS A MEANS OF 
ADVANCING THEIR INTERESTS.  WHILE THE WILL OF THE 
MAJORITY, EXPRESSED THROUGH THE FREE BALLOT, IS THE 
BASIS OF POLITICAL DECISIONS, THE CONSTITUTION STATES 
EXPLICITLY: \"DECISIONS BY THE MAJORITY PROVIDE FOR THE 
PROTECTION OF MINORITIES.\" 
 
THE LEGISLATURE 
--------------- 
 
5.  THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR A BICAMERAL 
LEGISLATURE:  A 200-MEMBER CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES 
(SUCCESSOR TO THE CZECH NATIONAL COUNCIL) AND AN 
81-MEMBER SENATE.  THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, BY FAR THE 
MORE POWERFUL OF THE TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, IS 
ELECTED EVERY FOUR YEARS, UNDER A SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL 
REPRESENTATION.  ELECTIONS TO THE SENATE WILL TAKE PLACE 
EVERY TWO YEARS, WITH ONE THIRD OF THE SEATS BEING 
FILLED EACH TIME.  (THE TERM FOR SENATORS IS SIX 
YEARS.)  SENATORS WILL BE ELECTED FROM SINGLE-MEMBER 
DISTRICTS.  WHILE DEPUTIES NEED ONLY BE TWENTY-ONE YEARS 
OLD, SENATORS MUST BE AT LEAST FORTY. 
 
6.  THOUGH SIMILAR IN THEIR ARRAY OF OFFICERS, COMMITTEE 
STRUCTURES, AND THE IMMUNITIES OF THEIR MEMBERS, THE TWO 
HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT HAVE SOME RATHER DIFFERENT 
FUNCTIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE ONLY TO THE 
CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, AND ONLY THE CHAMBER CAN APPROVE 
THE BUDGET AND THE FINAL YEAR-END ACCOUNTING.  ON THE 
OTHER HAND, THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC CAN DISSOLVE 
THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES UNDER CAREFULLY DEFINED 
CONDITIONS OF LEGISLATIVE GRIDLOCK. (SEE PARA 13.)  WHEN 
THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES IS DISSOLVED, THE SENATE STEPS 
IN AND CAN APPROVE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES PROPOSED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT, OTHER THAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS, THE STATE 
BUDGET, ELECTION LAWS, OR INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, WHICH HAVE THE 
FORCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.  (IN ORDER TO RETAIN ITS 
VALIDITY, HOWEVER, A MEASURE PASSED BY THE SENATE MUST 
BE CONFIRMED BY THE CHAMBER WHEN IT MEETS AGAIN.) 
 
7.  AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND THE 
SENATE IS REQUIRED TO DECLARE WAR OR APPROVE THE 
STATIONING OF FOREIGN TROOPS ON CZECH SOIL.  (A SIMPLE 
MAJORITY OF ALL DEPUTIES AND ALL SENATORS IS REQUIRED.) 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS REQUIRE 
3/5 OF ALL DEPUTIES AND 3/5 OF ALL SENATORS PRESENT FOR 
THE GIVEN VOTE.  REGULAR LAWS ONLY REQUIRE SIMPLE 
MAJORITIES OF ALL DEPUTIES OR SENATORS PRESENT FOR THE 
VOTE. 
 
8.  IN FACT, WHEN IT COMES TO REGULAR LAWS, THE CHAMBER 
OF DEPUTIES IS FIRMLY IN THE DRIVER\'S SEAT.  ALL DRAFT 
LAWS ARE INTRODUCED IN THE CHAMBER.  IF THE CHAMBER 
APPROVES A LAW, IT PASSES IT TO THE SENATE.  IF THE 
SENATE REJECTS A LAW PASSED IN THE CHAMBER, THE LAW GOES 
INTO EFFECT IF THE CHAMBER APPROVES IT AGAIN BY A SIMPLE 
MAJORITY OF ALL DEPUTIES.  A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF ALL 
DEPUTIES IS ALSO SUFFICIENT TO OVERTURN A VETO BY THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. 
 
9.  WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE SENATE 
DOES HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES COMPLETELY DISTINCT FROM 
THOSE OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  THE SENATE MUST 
APPROVE THE PRESIDENT\'S APPOINTEES TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
COURT, AND HAS THE POWER TO STRIP CONSTITUTIONAL COURT 
JUDGES OF THEIR IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION.  IT IS ALSO 
THE SENATE THAT HAS THE POWER TO INDICT THE PRESIDENT 
FOR TREASON, THE ONLY CRIME FOR WHICH THE PRESIDENT MAY 
BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED. 
 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC 
----------------------------- 
 
10.  CHAPTER 3 OF THE CONSTITUTION DEFINES EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH POWERS.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC (MINIMUM 
AGE 40) IS THE CHIEF OF STATE, ELECTED AT A JOINT 
SESSION OF THE TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT FOR A FIVE-YEAR 
TERM.  (THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT SERVE MORE THAN TWO 
CONSECUTIVE TERMS.)  A SINGLE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAN 
INCLUDE AS MANY AS THREE ROUNDS.  THE FIRST ROUND 
REQUIRES A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF ALL DEPUTIES AND A SIMPLE 
MAJORITY OF ALL SENATORS.  IN THE SECOND ROUND, A SIMPLE 
MAJORITY OF DEPUTIES PRESENT AND OF SENATORS PRESENT IS 
SUFFICIENT.  IN THE THIRD ROUND, A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF 
ALL DEPUTIES AND SENATORS, TAKEN AS A WHOLE, IS 
SUFFICIENT.  DESPITE ELECTION BY PARLIAMENT, HOWEVER, 
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE 
EXERCISE OF HIS OFFICE. 
 
11.  THE PRESIDENT\'S EXCLUSIVE POWERS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 
 
-- APPOINTS, DISMISSES, AND ACCEPTS THE RESIGNATION OF 
THE PRIME MINISTER AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, 
AND EMPOWERS A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS RESIGNED OR BEEN 
DISMISSED TO EXERCISE ITS FUNCTIONS TEMPORARILY; 
 
-- APPOINTS JUDGES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE 
CHAIRMAN AND DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE SUPREME COURT, THE 
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME INSPECTION 
OFFICE, AND THE MEMBERS OF THE BANK COUNCIL OF THE CZECH 
NATIONAL BANK; 
 
--  CONVENES SESSIONS OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES OR 
DISSOLVES THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES UNDER SPECIFIED 
CONDITIONS; 
 
--  SIGNS LAWS, OR CAN RETURN TO PARLIAMENT LAWS IT HAS 
PASSED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS; 
 
--  ISSUES PARDONS, COMMUTES SENTENCES, ORDERS THAT 
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS NOT BE OPENED OR BE DISCONTINUED, 
ERASES CONVICTIONS. 
 
12.  THE PRESIDENT ALSO EXERCISES A NUMBER OF POWERS 
JOINTLY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OR OTHER AUTHORIZED 
MINISTERS, IN THE SENSE THAT PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS IN 
THESE AREAS REQUIRE THE SIGNATURE OF THE PRIME MINISTER 
OR OTHER GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE TO TAKE EFFECT: 
 
--  REPRESENTS THE STATE IN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS, ACCREDITS 
AND RECALLS HEADS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS, RECEIVES HEADS 
OF FOREIGN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS; 
 
--  NEGOTIATES AND RATIFIES INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, OR 
TRANSFERS SUCH RESPONSIBILITY TO THE GOVERNMENT; 
 
--  CALLS ELECTIONS TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND 
SENATE; 
 
--  SUPREME COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES, APPOINTMENT AND 
PROMOTION OF GENERALS; 
 
--  CONFERS STATE DECORATIONS; 
 
--  APPOINTS JUDGES; 
 
--  GRANTS AMNESTY. 
 
13.  THE PRESIDENT IS EMPOWERED TO DISSOLVE THE CHAMBER 
OF DEPUTIES, IF IT IS CLEARLY DEADLOCKED OR OTHERWISE 
INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING ITSELF.  SPECIFICALLY, THE 
PRESIDENT MAY ACT WHEN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES VOTES 
NO-CONFIDENCE IN A GOVERNMENT WHOSE PRIME MINISTER WAS 
NAMED BY THE PRESIDENT AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  (NOTE: AFTER TWO FAILED 
ATTEMPTS TO WIN CONFIDENCE FOR A PRIME MINISTER OF HIS 
OWN CHOOSING, THE PRESIDENT IS REQUIRED TO NOMINATE A 
PRIME MINISTER PROPOSED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER 
OF DEPUTIES.)  DISSOLUTION ALSO IS POSSIBLE IF THE 
CHAMBER IS ADJOURNED FOR LONGER THAN PERMISSIBLE (120 
DAYS), HAS NO QUORUM FOR THREE MONTHS, OR FAILS FOR 
THREE MONTHS TO EXPRESS ITSELF ON A GOVERNMENT DRAFT LAW 
ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLACED THE QUESTION OF 
CONFIDENCE. 
 
14.  THE PRESIDENT HAS A LIMITED VETO POWER.  HE CAN 
RETURN UNSIGNED A LAW OTHER THAN A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, 
PROVIDING THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES WITH AN EXPLANATION. 
THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES VOTES AGAIN ON THE LAW, WITH NO 
AMENDMENTS ALLOWED, AND A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF ALL 
DEPUTIES IS SUFFICIENT TO OVERTURN THE VETO. 
 
15.  WHEN THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC IS 
VACANT OR THE INCUMBENT CANNOT EXERCISE HIS OFFICE, THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES EXERCISES MOST OF 
THE FUNCTIONS IN PARA 11, MOST IMPORTANTLY THOSE HAVING 
TO DO WITH APPOINTING AND DISMISSING THE GOVERNMENT AND 
CONVENING OR DISSOLVING THE CHAMBER.  THE PRIME MINISTER 
EXERCISES MOST OF THE FUNCTIONS IN PARA 12, INCLUDING 
THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND COMMAND OF THE ARMED 
FORCES. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT 
-------------- 
 
16.  THE ARTICLES DEFINING THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNMENT 
ARE MUCH LESS DETAILED THAN THOSE ON PRESIDENTIAL 
POWERS.  THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE TO THE CHAMBER OF 
DEPUTIES, AND AUTOMATICALLY OFFERS ITS RESIGNATION AFTER 
THE CONSTITUENT SESSION OF A NEWLY-ELECTED CHAMBER OF 
DEPUTIES.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC NAMES THE PRIME 
MINISTER, AND, AT HIS SUGGESTION, APPOINTS THE OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT MAKES ITS 
DECISIONS AS A BODY, ON THE BASIS OF A VOTE BY A SIMPLE 
MAJORITY OF ALL MEMBERS. 
 
THE JUDICIARY 
-------------- 
 
17.  THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE 
COURTS AND OF INDIVIDUAL JUDGES.  IT PROVIDES FOR A 
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF FIFTEEN JUDGES, APPOINTED FOR 
TEN-YEAR TERMS BY THE PRESIDENT WITH THE CONSENT OF THE 
SENATE.  THE JUDGES ARE BOUND ONLY BY CONSTITUTIONAL 
LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, AND THEIR MAIN 
FUNCTION IS TO REVIEW LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL REGULATIONS 
TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY ARE AT VARIANCE WITH 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OR A BINDING INTERNATIONAL 
AGREEMENT.  THEY ALSO RULE IN CASES WHERE STATE BODIES 
ARE ACCUSED OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTS. 
 
18.  UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, THE PRIMARY ROLE OF THE 
COURTS IS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS TO CITIZENS.  THE 
REGULAR JUDICIARY CONSISTS OF THE SUPREME COURT, THE 
SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE COURT, HIGH, REGIONAL, AND 
DISTRICT COURTS.  THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC APPOINTS 
JUDGES FOR AN UNLIMITED TERM.  THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT 
SPECIFY IN WHICH CASES JUDGES MAKE THEIR DECISIONS AS A 
PANEL, IN WHICH CASES JUDGES MAKE THEIR DETERMINATIONS 
INDIVIDUALLY, AND HOW CITIZENS OTHER THAN JUDGES MAY 
PARTICIPATE IN COURT DELIBERATIONS.  THESE MATTERS ARE 
LEFT TO DEFINITION BY SUBSEQUENT LAWS.  THE CONSTITUTION 
GUARANTEES EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.  COURT RULINGS ARE 
ALWAYS ANNOUNCED IN PUBLIC, AND COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE AS 
A RULE PUBLIC.  EXCEPTIONS CAN BE SPECIFIED BY LAW.  THE 
CONSTITUTION ALSO REFERS TO A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\'S 
OFFICE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE PUBLIC IN CRIMINAL 
PROCEEDINGS, BUT DOES NOT DEFINE THE STATUS AND 
JURISDICTION OF THE OFFICE, LEAVING THAT TO SUBSEQUENT 
LAWS. 
 
OTHER INSTITUTIONS 
------------------ 
 
19.  THE CONSTITUTION ALSO PROVIDES FOR A SUPREME 
INSPECTION OFFICE, DEFINED AS AN INDEPENDENT BODY WHICH 
PERFORMS INSPECTIONS OF THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE PROPERTY 
AND FULFILLMENT OF THE STATE BUDGET.  THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE REPUBLIC, UPON PROPOSAL OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, 
APPOINTS THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME 
INSPECTION OFFICE.  THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT, HOWEVER, 
FURTHER ADDRESS THE ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE 
OFFICE, LEAVING THAT TO SUBSEQUENT LAWS. 
 
20.  THE CZECH NATIONAL BANK, I.E. THE CENTRAL STATE 
BANK, RECEIVES SIMILAR TREATMENT.  THE CONSTITUTION 
DEFINES THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE BANK AS THE 
MAINTENANCE OF A STABLE CURRENCY, AND STATES IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO INTERVENE IN THE BANK\'S ACTIVITIES SOLELY ON 
THE BASIS OF LAW.  THE PRESIDENT APPOINTS THE MEMBERS OF 
THE BANK COUNCIL.  OTHER ASPECTS ARE LEFT TO BE 
DETERMINED BY SUBSEQUENT LAWS. 
 
TERRITORIAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION 
------------------------------- 
 
21.  THE MUNICIPALITY (OBEC) IS THE BASIC UNIT OF 
TERRITORIAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION, WITH LANDS (ZEME) OR 
REGIONS (KRAJE) AS HIGHER UNITS.  THE CONSTITUTION 
ITSELF DOES NOT LAY OUT THE SIZE AND BOUNDARIES OF THESE 
UNITS.  (NOTE: USE OF THE TERM \"LAND\" IS A SMALL 
CONCESSION TO MORAVIAN AND SILESIAN DESIRES FOR SOME 
RECOGNITION OF THE DISTINCT HISTORICAL STATUS OF THEIR 
AREAS.  IT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT, FOR THE DRAFTERS OF 
THE CONSTITUTION, THE \"LANDS\" TO ALL INTENTS AND 
PURPOSES WILL BE ANALOGOUS TO THE ALREADY EXISTING 
\"REGIONS\", RATHER THAN TO LARGER HISTORIC AREAS SUCH AS 
MORAVIA OR SILESIA.)  THE UNITS OF TERRITORIAL 
SELF-ADMINISTRATION ELECT THEIR OWN BOARDS OF 
REPRESENTATIVES FOR FOUR-YEAR TERMS, AND CAN OWN 
PROPERTY AND \"ENGAGE IN MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO THEIR 
OWN BUDGETS.\"  THE CONSTITUTION OTHERWISE LEAVES THE 
EXACT AUTHORITY OF THE BOARDS OF REPRESENTATIVES TO BE 
DEFINED BY SUBSEQUENT LAWS. 
 
TEMPORARY PROVISIONS AND ENTRY INTO FORCE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
22.  THE CONSTITUTION TAKES EFFECT JANUARY 1, 1993.  ON 
THAT DATE, THE CZECH NATIONAL COUNCIL, THE CURRENT 
REPUBLIC PARLIAMENT, WILL BECOME THE CHAMBER OF 
DEPUTIES, WITH ITS TERM TO END ON JUNE 6, 1996.  THE 
CONSTITUTION STATES THAT A PROVISIONAL SENATE WILL BE 
CONSTITUTED TO COVER THE PERIOD UNTIL REGULAR SENATE 
ELECTIONS ARE HELD.  UNTIL A PROVISIONAL SENATE IS IN 
PLACE, THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES WILL PERFORM THE 
FUNCTIONS OF THE SENATE.  (NOTE: A LAW TRANSFORMING THE 
CZECH DEPUTIES FROM THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY INTO A 
PROVISIONAL SENATE FAILED TO PASS THE CZECH NATIONAL 
COUNCIL.  A SOMEWHAT MODIFIED VERSION OF THE LAW WILL 
COME UP AGAIN, BUT PERHAPS NOT UNTIL MID-JANUARY.) 
 
EMBASSY COMMENT 
--------------- 
 
23.  IN ITS FUNDAMENTAL PROVISIONS, THE CZECH 
CONSTITUTION CLEARLY REFLECTS THE \"CIVIC PRINCIPLE\" 
CENTRAL TO THE IDEOLOGY OF THE CZECH GOVERNING COALITION 
PARTIES, ESP. THE CIVIC DEMOCRATIC PARTY (ODS) AND THE 
CIVIC DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE (ODA). .THE RIGHTS SPECIFIED 
IN THE CONSTITUTION ARE THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS OF A 
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RIGHTS THOSE CITIZENS DERIVE 
FROM THEIR BASIC HUMANITY.  THE GOVERNING COALITION 
SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED OPPOSITION EFFORTS TO INCLUDE THE 
CZECHOSLOVAK CHARTER OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS 
DIRECTLY IN THE CONSTITUTION, PUTTING THE CHARTER 
IMPLICITLY ON A SOMEWHAT LOWER LEVEL AS PART OF THE CR\'S 
\"CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER.\"  THE CHARTER INCLUDES SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC GUARANTEES, E.G. TO EMPLOYMENT AND PENSIONS, 
VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE BASIC CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS THE 
GOVERNING PARTIES FOCUS ON.  IT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT THAT 
THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE EQUALITY OF CITIZENS AS 
INDIVIDUALS, WITHOUT SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO RIGHTS OF 
GROUPS SUCH AS NATIONAL OR ETHNIC MINORITIES.  THE 
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS THAT THE CONSTITUTION DOES GUARANTEE 
ARE GUARANTEED UNEQUIVOCALLY, WITH NO ROOM FOR 
EXCEPTION, AND PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND 
REGULAR JUDICIARY.  THE CITIZEN HAS AMPLE RECOURSE 
AGAINST VIOLATIONS OF HIS RIGHTS BY THE INSTRUMENTS OF 
STATE POWER. 
 
24.  THE CZECH CONSTITUTION IS FULLY COMPARABLE TO THE 
CONSTITUTIONS OF CONTINENTAL WEST EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY 
DEMOCRACIES, AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE 1920 CONSTITUTION 
OF DEMOCRATIC CZECHOSLOVAKIA IS EVIDENT.  THE POWERS OF 
THE PRESIDENT MAY BE SLIGHTLY GREATER THAN THE CURRENT 
WEST EUROPEAN AVERAGE, REFLECTING BOTH THE TRADITION OF 
FIRST REPUBLIC CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND THE EFFORTS OF VACLAV 
HAVEL TO ENSURE THAT THE OFFICE HE HOPES TO HOLD WILL BE 
GENUINELY SUBSTANTIVE.  (CZECH PRIME MINISTER KLAUS, A 
STRONG ADVOCATE OF THE PARTY-BASED PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM 
OF GOVERNMENT, WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A SOMEWHAT WEAKER 
PRESIDENCY, BUT HAS LITTLE REASON TO BE DISSATISFIED.) 
 
25.  THE ONLY VISIBLE CONCESSION TO THE DEMANDS OF THE 
MORAVIAN AND SILESIAN AUTONOMISTS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
USE THE TERM \"LAND\" (ZEME) FOR THE HIGHER UNITS OF 
TERRITORIAL SELF-ADMINISTRATION, AND THE RIGHT FOR THE 
BOARDS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THOSE HIGHER UNITS TO 
PROPOSE LEGISLATION TO THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES.  THIS 
FALLS FAR SHORT OF WHAT THE MORAVIANS HOPED FOR. 
CONCESSIONS TO THE GREENS WERE SIMILARLY MODEST. 
ARTICLE 7 ONLY REQUIRES THE STATE TO \"SEE TO THE 
CAUTIOUS USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND TO THE PROTECTION 
OF NATURAL WEALTH.\"  THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT A 
SUBSEQUENT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CAN ESTABLISH WHEN THE 
PEOPLE MAY EXERCISE STATE POWER DIRECTLY, I.E. BY MEANS 
OF A REFERENDUM, BUT THIS DOES NOT GO NEARLY AS FAR AS 
THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT OPPOSITION HAD HOPED. 
 
26.  IN SUM, THE CZECH GOVERNING PARTIES HAVE REASON TO 
BE QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE CONSTITUTION.  THE SAME 
SHOULD BE TRUE FOR THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES.  THE 
CONSTITUTION APPEARS TO US TO INCLUDE ALL THE NECESSARY 
GUARANTEES OF POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND OF CIVIL AND HUMAN 
RIGHTS.  ALSO, WHILE THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT REFER 
SPECIFICALLY TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, IT IS CLEARLY THE 
PRODUCT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DEVOTED TO FREE-MARKET 
PRINCIPLES AND DO NOT WANT TO CONDITION PEOPLE\'S 
ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR AND LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES BY 
CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS.

REF: STATE 192153 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION JOHN J. BORIS 
PER 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) ON NOVEMBER 13, WE BRIEFED THE NEW DIRECTOR OF THE 
MFA\'S ASIA AND PACIFIC DEPARTMENT, IVAN JESTRAB, ON THE 
POINTS IN REFTEL ON AFGHANISTAN\'S FUTURE.  JESTRAB, WHO TOOK 
OVER AS DIRECTOR ON NOVEMBER 1 AFTER SERVING FOR SEVERAL 
YEARS AS THE CZECH AMBASSADOR IN NEW DELHI, EXPRESSED HIS 
APPRECIATION FOR THE INFORMATION AND HIS DESIRE TO CONTINUE 
THE CLOSE COOPERATION OF HIS PREDECESSOR WITH THE EMBASSY. 
SPEAKING MORE  GENERALLY, HE REITERATED THE STRONG SUPPORT OF 
THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC FOR THE WAR 
ON TERRORISM AND THE U.S. POLICY TOWARD AFGHANISTAN.  HE 
PROMISED TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH OTHER KEY PERSONNEL IN 
THE MFA, INCLUDING IVAN BUSNIAK, THE DIRECTOR OF THE EASTERN 
EUROPE DEPARTMENT, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CENTRAL ASIA, AND 
JOSEF KOUTSKY, WHO IS THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE MIDDLE EAST 
AND NORTH AFRICA DEPARTMENT.  OVERALL COORDINATION OF THE 
MFA\'S AFGHANISTAN POLICY, HE SAID, WAS HANDLED BY THE 
DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS, JAKUB KARFIK, A 
FORMER CZECH DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN ISLAMABAD.  THE NEW 
DEPUTY MINISTER FOR BILATERAL RELATIONS,   RUDOLF JINDRAK 
(AND FORMER CZECH AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY), WHO REPLACED HYNEK 
KMONICEK ON NOVEMBER 1, IS FOCUSED ON HIS AREA OF EXPERTISE, 
NAMELY EUROPE. 
 
2. (C) JESTRAB EXPRESSED PESSIMISM ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT 
NORTHERN ALLIANCE FORCES WOULD STOP SHORT OF KABUL.  NEWS 
REPORTS ALREADY INDICATED THEY WERE ENTERING THE CAPITAL.  HE 
WELCOMED ANY INFORMATION ON OUR THINKING ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF 
FORMING OF COALITION GOVERNMENT AND THE POSSIBLE 
PARTICIPANTS.  DURING HIS SERVICE IN INDIA, THE DIRECTOR HAD 
COME TO KNOW THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE\'S AMBASSADOR TO INDIA AND 
HIS WIFE AS PERSONAL FRIENDS AND FINE HUMAN BEINGS.  JESTRAB 
WAS RELIEVED TO LEARN HIS FRIEND SURVIVED THE ASSASSINATION 
OF MASOOD.  STILL, HE WAS SKEPTICAL WHETHER THE ALLIANCE, 
WITH ITS LIMITED ETHNIC MAKEUP, COULD ENSURE THE CREATION OF 
A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT.  THE RISK OF THE CARVING UP OF 
AFGHANISTAN INTO WARRING FIEFDOMS LOOMED LARGE.  A PROLONGED 
GUERRILLA WAR COULD ALSO DE-STABILIZE PAKISTAN.  IF A COUP 
CAME, IT WOULD LIKELY BE LEAD BY \"MEN IN BEARDS AND TURBANS\" 
(I.E., ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS) ALLIED TO THE TALIBAN. 
 
3. (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT AFGHANS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, 
JESTRAB NOTED HE HAD BEEN IN OFFICE A VERY SHORT TIME AND HAD 
NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO MEET ALL THE INTERESTED PLAYERS.  HE 
STATED, HOWEVER, THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY COUNTRYWIDE 
ORGANIZATION OF AFGHANS.  MOST OF THE AFGHANS WHO WERE IN THE 
COUNTRY HAD APPLIED FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM AND WERE HOPING TO 
STAY IN EUROPE; THEY DID NOT, HE SAID, WANT TO ATTRACT 
ATTENTION.  THE LOCAL AFGHANI EMBASSY WAS STAFFED BY A SINGLE 
DIPLOMAT WHOSE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE EVENTS OR POLICY WAS 
MINIMAL.  WE AGREED TO REMAIN IN CLOSE CONTACT.

SUBJECT: CZECH PARLIAMENT PASSES 2005 STATE BUDGET 
 
REF: PRAGUE 1426 
 
1.  By a 101-99 vote, the Czech Parliament approved on 
December 15 the 2005 state budget with a Kc 83.6 billion 
($3.7 billion) deficit -- essentially as presented to it by 
Prime Minister Stanislav Gross.  (The state budget differs 
from the overall public budget in that it excludes certain 
off-budget funds and local government.)  The budgeted deficit 
is less than 2003\'s expected Kc 114 billion actual state 
budget deficit.  The government reportedly expects to take in 
Kc 71 billion ($3.1 billion) more in taxes than in 2004, 
mainly due to increases in VAT receipts.  VAT rates increased 
this year, and consumption is growing along with GDP. 
Without a determined approach to containing expenditures, 
however, the deficit is unlikely to change much. 
 
2.  Defense expenditures are slated to increase slightly from 
2004 to Kc 52.9 billion ($2.35 billion), about 1.8% of 
projected 2005 GDP.  See reftel for a review of spending 
priorities in the budget. 
 
3.  The only serious issue at the end of the budget debate 
was what to do with savings from a delay in the scheduled pay 
increase for police and firemen.  KDU-CSL leader Miroslav 
Kalousek -- who had fought the police pay increase and been 
the leading proponent of budget austerity -- wanted to steer 
more than half of the money into agricultural subsidies, 
benefiting a major KDU-CSL constituency.  He failed to 
overcome the opposition of the CSSD members of parliament, 
supported by the Communists.  At first the Communists wanted 
to pay for the increase by cutting the defense budget, and 
many CSSD deputies agreed with that idea.  However, the small 
Freedom Union party (a coalition member) objected, and a 
compromise was worked out.  Farmers will receive their 
payments from the off-budget agricultural fund.  The savings 
from the police pay increase will be partly held in 
government reserves and partly spent on various current 
expenses, leaving the deficit as is.  This outcome satisfied 
PM Gross, who was pleased that \"no one will be able to go 
around the rural areas and claim they got them money\" -- a 
barb aimed at Kalousek. 
 
4.  As expected, the budget debate presented only a 
manageable threat to survival of the CSSD-KDU-Freedom Union 
coalition.  Next year\'s debate over the budget may be more 
contentious, and there is speculation that the KDU-CSL\'s 
Kalousek may foment differences with the CSSD to provide an 
excuse for leaving the coalition in advance of new elections. 
 In the meantime, the real challenge for the government is 
finding the political will to reform the pension and health 
systems in order to gain control of continuing high deficits 
and growing government debt.  The debt is expected to reach 
25% of GDP this year by GOCR calculations and even more if 
calculated in accordance with the European Union\'s ESA 95 
standards.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: SENV, EIND, EZ, EUN 
SUBJECT: COALED CASH - CZECH EMISSION TRADING PLAN: DRAFTED 
BY BUSINESS, FOR BUSINESS, WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED SUPPORT 
OF BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION. 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified -- not for Internet distribution. 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY.  The Czech Republic has proposed to the EU an 
emissions trading scheme that increases the ceiling on 
emissions above current levels.  Environmental groups point 
to conflicts of interest, say the Czech proposal ignores 
submission criteria and the government\'s own stated energy 
policy, and argue it amounts to massive subsidies to 
state-run and private firms; the Environment Ministry echoes 
this view.  But governing left-of-center Social Democrats 
have come down firmly on the side of business, and the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade largely dictated the terms of 
the Czech proposal.  Because of their delay in submitting a 
proposal for vetting, the Czech Republic will not be a part 
of the EU emissions trading scheme when it begins January 1. 
End Summary 
 
2. (U) The sectors of Czech industry that will participate in 
the emissions trading scheme have historically emitted 
approximately 89 million tons of CO2 annually.  Environmental 
NGOs, in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol, asked the 
government to submit a National Allocation Plan (NAP) under 
the EU\'s emissions trading scheme of 85 million tons, a small 
reduction.  However, the latest version of the Czech\'s NAP, 
which won\'t be approved by the European Commission in time 
for the January 1, 2005 start of the trading scheme, sets 
allocations levels at 107.6 million tons, an increase of 
roughly 21 percent. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
POTENTIAL TO REDUCE COAL CONSUMPTION NOT INCLUDED IN NAP 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
3. (U) The Czech Republic gets approximately 80 percent of 
its electricity from power plants that burn a soft form of 
coal.  The State energy plan had called for some of the 
dirtiest coal burning plants to be retired as the nuclear 
plant at Temelin came on line, or by 2010 at the latest. 
Temelin\'s two reactors have just finished their trial period 
and are now operating at full capacity.  Nearly all of their 
output is exported.  In fact, the Czechs are now the 7th 
biggest exporter of electricity in the world.  But none of 
the coal-fired plants have been shut down, nor have the 
reductions in coal consumption that these shutdowns would 
bring been included in the NAP, even though these shutdowns 
are part of the government\'s published energy policy. 
 
4. (U) Other potential reductions could be found in wasteful 
heating systems, and the old communist-era factories.  Older 
Czech buildings and the water pipes that deliver heat are 
badly insulated.   Many factories could reduce emissions 
simply by switching fuel from coal to gas.  But once again, 
there is no assumption in the NAP that any reductions will 
occur. 
 
5. (U) The Czech NAP was drawn up by the Ministry of Industry 
and Trade, which has not revealed the methods it used to 
arrive at the figure of 107.6 metric tons.  The business 
community was consulted.  The government then cited business 
confidentiality as the reason for excluding NGOs from the 
 
SIPDIS 
process.  Just under two-thirds of the allocations would go 
to the energy sector,  the main company of which, CEZ, has 
the Czech government as its main shareholder.  Another 
beneficiary would be the commercialized firm, Viltcovice 
Steel, which also has the state as its main shareholder.  As 
one environmental NGO pointed out, the Czech government has 
no incentive to force itself to make costly changes and 
reduce emissions at state-run firms.  On the contrary, 
surplus allocations of 18.6 million tons a year, if the 
market price stays near the current value of 9 Euro, could 
mean an extra 220 million dollars a year for Czech firms. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
CREATING A MARKET WHEN YOU,RE THE ONLY PLAYER 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Last year the world\'s biggest emissions and coal 
brokerage firm, Evolution Markets, teamed up with a Slovak 
Firm, Menert, to form Evolution Menert.  This firm advised 
several Central European governments, including the Czechs, 
on how to draft a NAP.   The firm, which has offices in 
Bratislava and Prague, is currently the only emissions broker 
in the two countries.  It stands to make healthy profits off 
the trade of surplus allocations.  As the firm,s own web 
page points out, \"Slovakia and the Czech Republic are 
positioned to be major participants in global greenhouse gas 
markets.  Both countries are currently well below their 
greenhouse gas emission reduction targets under the Kyoto 
Protocol.  In addition, Slovak and Czech government officials 
are encouraging investment in their energy infrastructure 
that will not only improve services, but also reduce overall 
levels of greenhouse gas emissions.\" 
 
7. (U) Environmentalists ask why, if the Czech Republic is 
already below its emissions target, and the government is 
encouraging further reductions in the levels of emissions, 
did the government and Evolution Mennert draft a plan with 
emission allocations 21 percent higher than the target?  Ivo 
Mravinac, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry and 
Trade offered one answer to this question: &It,s useful for 
the firms to have permission for emissions at higher levels 
so that if they do not use up their quota, they could trade 
the remainder with other countries.8 
------------------------------- 
MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND TIRADE 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) The Czech emissions trading proposal has touched off 
debate between government ministries, but there has been 
little political debate.  Both major political parties -- the 
center-left Social Democrats, who lead the governing 
coalition, and the center-right Civic Democrats, who are the 
main opposition party and generally practice a policy of zero 
tolerance towards the government -- support the proposed 
scheme.  Large Czech businesses, which initially opposed the 
emissions trading scheme, but now embrace it having realized 
the potential windfall it represents.  On the political 
scene, matters came to a head on November 2nd when the lower 
house of parliament undertook the second reading of a bill 
that would set conditions for participation in the scheme. 
The Ministry of the Environment had insisted that any 
revenues generated by the sales of allowances be spent on 
green technologies.  But a coalition of pro-business forces 
defeated this motion. The Minister of the Environment, Libor 
Ambrozek, felt that parliamentarians from both the government 
and opposition were conspiring, along with the directors of 
the nation,s largest industrial firms and the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade, to draft a bill that would favor business 
at the cost of the environment.  He sent the company 
directors SMS messages saying \"the changes have undoubtedly 
been prepared by you and the Ministry of Industry and Trade.\" 
 Ambrozek, a Christian Democrat normally considered a soft 
spoken gentleman, included a vulgar expression in his SMS, 
which touched off calls for his resignation by one member of 
parliament\'s committee on trade. 
 
9. (SBU) The Czech Plan is one of 4 NAPs that the European 
Commission must still approve. Poloff spoke with Dr. Jiri 
Hlavacek, a special advisor to the Minister of the 
Environment about the Czech NAP\'s chances in Brussels.  He 
acknowledged that most of the new EU states have had their 
NAP proposals cut by 20 percent, but added, \"We are prepared 
to go to Brussels and fight for this.\"  However, others at 
the ministry confided to Poloff that, \"He has to say this, 
although the current plan is politically indefensible.\" 
 
11. (SBU) Comment:  We can only wait and see how far the 
European Commission will cut back on the Czech NAP.  But it 
seems clear enough that the Czechs are not hoping for a 
market-based method of producing the most cost-effective 
reductions in greenhouse gases.  Instead, it appears that 
they, as was the case with other members of the former Soviet 
Bloc, see the scheme as a distortion of market forces, that 
might allow some Czech firms, including those run by the 
state itself, to reap windfall profits while avoiding the 
reductions in emissions that are the principal reason for the 
scheme,s existence.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Czech Chamber of Deputies approved the 
final chapters of the government\'s 2005 deployment plan on 
December 15.  The deployment plan, which reflects the 
government\'s priority in the Balkans, calls for up to 600 
troops for the KFOR mission in Kosovo, and up to 90 troops as 
part of the EU\'s operation in Bosnia.  In Iraq it covers the 
previously authorized team of military policy through 
February, 2005, as well as a small group of military surgeons 
in Basra; approximately 90 Czech troops will be deployed in 
Afghanistan.  Any deployment of military police in Iraq 
beyond February (as per ref B) would need separate 
parliamentary approval.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) The 2005 deployment plan approved by the Czech 
parliament on December 15 will cost the Czech government 1.3 
billion Crowns, or roughly 56 million dollars.  The plan 
authorizes the deployment of up to 850 personnel, or 
approximately 3.5% of the current Czech military force. 
 
3. (SBU) The 2005 deployment plan has been pending for some 
time.  Former Prime Minster Spidla\'s cabinet had approved the 
overall plan in July; the Senate approved it later in the 
summer.  But political instability, and opposition from the 
Civic Democrats (ODS) -- who want to limit the number of 
foreign deployments to three, and ideally two -- kept the 
comprehensive plan from being sent to the Chamber of Deputies 
for a vote.  The less controversial deployments, to Kosovo 
and Afghanistan, were separately approved by the Chamber in 
November, as was the two-month extension of the military 
policy in Iraq until after the Iraqi elections.  The new 
Bosnia mission was the most controversial and the explicit 
target of ODS criticism.  The GOCR intentionally scheduled 
the vote on the Bosnia mission to coincide with voting on the 
2005 budget, i.e., when the government was sure that it would 
have all coalition members in place to maintain its one-vote 
majority. 
 
4. (U) For the deployment to Kosovo, the number of Czech 
troops will grow from approximately 400 to 600 next year. 
They will operate in a joint battalion with 100 Slovaks in 
the Central Brigade, now commanded by Finns.  The Czechs 
expect to take command of the brigade in August of 2005. 
 
5. (U) In Bosnia, roughly 25 troops will accompany two M-17 
helicopters that are being sent for use by Eurofor HQ staff, 
and 40 Czechs will join 40 Austrians in a mechanized unit. 
Six Czech staff who have been at mission HQ will continue 
their assignments. 
 
6. (U) The Czechs will have approximately 90 troops in two 
operations in Afghanistan.  One group of 50, primarily 
engineers and demining experts, has been working with the 
ISAF mission in Kabul.  Their mission will continue in 2005. 
A second group of 40 light infantry recon troops and medical 
staff will be deployed as part of the German PRT in Faisabad. 
 
7. (SBU) The 4th contingent of Military Police training Iraqi 
police at a base in Shaiba, not far from Basra, as part of 
the multinational force, MNF-I, rotated back to Prague in 
December.  The 5th contingent of approximately 80 
MPs, which recently replaced them, will stay in Basra until 
February 28, consistent with the parliamentary decision last 
month.  No additional military police deployments were 
discussed during the parliamentary vote on December 15. 
Orders for the 5th contingent include breaking camp before 
their return to Prague. 
 
8. (U) The December 15 decision did include authorization for 
a six-member Czech surgical team that will remain in Iraq 
with a British field hospital.  Parliament also authorized an 
additional 35 troops from an NBC platoon to join the NATO 
Reaction Force in the second half of the year. 
 
9. (SBU) The GOCR is under increasing pressure from the U.S. 
and UK to extend (or otherwise replace) their military police 
in Iraq beyond February (reftels).  As discussed in more 
detail ref C, the next opportunity for the Czech parliament 
to approve additional Iraq deployments will be during early 
February.

SUBJECT: CRISIS IN RULING CZECH CSSD: PARTY STUCK BETWEEN 
ROCK AND HARD PLACE 
 
REF: PRAGUE 1845 
 
Classified By: Political Officer Renata Sykorova Turnidge for reasons 1 
.4(b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  The initial period of relative calm and 
promise of consolidation in the main ruling Social Democratic 
Party (CSSD) after Stanislav Gross took over as acting party 
chairman this summer effectively ended with its poor showing 
in the November regional and Senate elections.  The elections 
once again brought to the fore the fundamental differences in 
orientation among various groups in the CSSD, exposed Gross\'s 
shortcomings as the party\'s leader, and undercut his 
leadership authority.  Above all, the election fiasco showed 
that even a young and (relatively) vibrant leader like Gross 
cannot make up for the lack of a concrete strategy for 
transforming the party and winning back voters.  The CSSD is 
stuck at a crossroads:  it has to make a choice between 
returning to its socialist-oriented party roots, advocated by 
the loose grouping known as the Renaissance platform, or 
transforming into a European-style Social Democratic party, 
with Tony Blair\'s Labour Party as a model.  However, internal 
disputes and a lack of vision among party leaders prevent a 
real solution.  CSSD disunity promises to undermine the work 
of the already weak governing coalition.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Gross Defends Policy, Challengers Remain 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  The latest crisis in the governing Czech Social 
Democratic Party developed after the CSSD\'s abysmal 
performance in the regional and Senate elections in November, 
which came on the heels of the debacle in the June European 
Parliament elections.  PM and acting CSSD Chairman Stanislav 
Gross responded weakly, for instance by suggesting that the 
Senate ought to be abolished altogether; many in the party 
criticized Gross\'s leadership and his three-party coalition 
with the center-right Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL) and the 
Freedom Union (US-DEU); there was discussion about the wisdom 
and necessity of CSSD collaborating more closely with the 
unreformed communist party (KSCM).  Gross\'s lack of control 
over the party became clear when left-oriented Labor and 
Social Affairs Minister Zdenek Skromach announced that he 
would challenge Gross for the top post at the party\'s 
upcoming March Congress.  After weeks of relative silence, 
Gross surprised many when at the early December CSSD 
Executive Committee meeting he took a resolute stand against 
a minority government with the tacit support of KSCM or any 
outreach to the disgruntled former PM Zeman, and criticized 
the party\'s parliamentary faction for its lack of 
cohesiveness.  Although he received the mandate from the 
Committee to continue in his position and remain in coalition 
with the KDU-CSL and US-DEU, Gross failed to quiet growing 
internal dissent from the CSSD\'s left wing and former Zeman 
supporters. 
 
3.  (C) The fault lines between the different interest and 
ideological groups are constantly changing, but Gross and his 
supporters face the biggest challenge from the loose leftist 
bloc that includes the Renaissance platform advocating 
Zeman\'s return.  Skromach has emerged as the only potential 
challenger to Gross at the CSSD March Congress, but support 
for his leadership currently is limited and he is not seen as 
a natural leader by the disgruntled group.  Gross\'s close 
ally Petr Ibl recently threatened to resign as CSSD 
parliamentary caucus chair unless intra-party communication 
improves; his departure would be a severe blow to Gross. 
Ibl\'s threat is only the most visible sign of what party 
insiders tell us is a wave of previous Gross supporters 
abandoning him.  Still, none yet see any sign of a challenger 
who can win the support of the disparate party groupings and 
unseat Gross at the party congress in March. 
--------------------------- 
Party Stuck at a Crossroads 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) In their meetings with Embassy officers, CSSD members 
admit the party is in a deep crisis and risks extinction if 
it does not consolidate and come up with a cohesive party 
program that will win back voters.  The party is stuck 
between the choice of moving right towards the political 
center, or veering left towards cooperation with the KSCM. 
Gross, in partnership with the respected Minister of Finance 
Bohuslav Sobotka, sees the transformation of CSSD into a 
mainstream, liberal European Social Democratic Party along 
the lines of the British Labour Party as the only chance to 
revitalize CSSD.  They estimate that the Czech public 
increasingly views reform as necessary to solve the country\'s 
economic and social problems, including the poorly 
functioning health care and pension systems, and abuses of 
social benefits, among others.  Gross and Sobotka advocate 
filling the relatively open space on the center of the Czech 
political spectrum, but face opposition from CSSD hard-liners 
who would prefer cooperation with the Communists and a return 
to the party\'s socialist principles.  This group is 
represented loosely by Labor Minister Skromach, MPs like Jan 
Kavan and Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vladimir 
Lastuvka.  However, despite Skromach\'s announced candidacy 
for party chair, the left faction lacks a visible leader. 
According to MP Hana Orgonikova, Skromach is the media face, 
but not a real leader of the group. 
 
5.  (C) CSSD will hold a program conference in late January 
to work out ideological differences and decide on the course 
the party will take in the run up to the 2006 parliamentary 
election.  However, numerous party members are skeptical that 
any real decisions will be made or implemented at the 
conference.  They complain of the lack of expertise and 
vision in the party, pointing out the complete 
non-functioning of the expert commissions that should be 
working on policy recommendations and concepts.  Some 
describe the current stalemate in the CSSD as a \"dead 
period\", with nothing meaningful happening and the party 
leadership at a loss of how to implement changes that are 
needed.  And below the dysfunctional leadership are the large 
group of 70 CSSD MPs whose main (or sole) priority is to get 
themselves re-elected in 2006. 
 
-------------------- 
Zeman In The Waiting 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Complicating the difficult situation is former PM 
and honorary CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman, who has not gotten 
over what he perceives as his betrayal in the 2003 
presidential election by Gross and others.  It is unclear 
whether his public attacks on Gross and most of the rest of 
the party leadership are intended to simply encourage Gross\'s 
opponents, or if Zeman really wants to return to politics. 
While the Renaissance group actively seeks his return, some 
admit that he has passed his political prime and is in fact 
out of touch with CSSD or Czech politics.  Of interest is 
Zeman\'s continued relationship with President Klaus, which is 
difficult to size up.  Zeman and his wife recently dined at 
the Klaus\'s residence for \"personal reasons,\" but some CSSD 
members speculate that there is more to the relationship than 
meets the eye and that Klaus wants to help Zeman return to 
politics.  The Embassy is closely watching how this 
relationship will further develop. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Comment:  Keep an Eye on Communists 
----------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) The CSSD is being squeezed from both sides:  on the 
one hand it is loosing out to the much strengthened 
center-right Civic Democratic Party, which decisively won all 
this year\'s elections (reftel), and on the other to the 
Communist Party that enjoys reliable support from voters on 
the left.  The KSCM poses a real threat of becoming the 
second strongest party in the country, because its leader 
Grebenicek and others sense the incredible opportunity 
provided to them by CSSD\'s troubles.  Grebenicek\'s statements 
earlier this month that the Communist party should distance 
itself from the crimes committed under Communism -- KSCM\'s 
first public admission that such crimes took place under its 
predecessor -- is aimed at making the party appear more 
modern and acceptable to the Czech public.  CSSD will have to 
come up soon with a viable strategy to maintain a 
long-standing position on the Czech political scene, or risk 
political irrelevance. 
 
8.  (C) CSSD\'s internal problems inevitably impact the 
governing coalition.  In the past, internal squabbles in the 
largest government party raised tensions within the 
government and threatened passage of government-initiated 
legislation.  There are already signs that nothing much can 
be expected from the current government in the next 18 
months.  The CSSD internal situation played a role in the 
December 20 agreement of the coalition parties\' leadership to 
set limited goals for the coming year:  more efficient legal 
proceedings, consensus on pension reform, and ratification of 
the EU constitution.  As discussed septel, Gross\'s weak 
position will impact on our efforts to secure Czech support 
in Iraq and on other priorities.

SUBJECT: ATTORNEY GENERAL ASHCROFT\'S DECEMBER 14 VISIT TO 
PRAGUE 
 
 
-- SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. PROTECT ACCORDINGLY -- 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Attorney General Ashcroft met separately 
with the Czech Ministers of the Interior and Justice in 
Prague, December 14, 2004.  The Attorney General thanked the 
Czechs for their contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan, as 
well as for their cooperation with U.S. law enforcement 
agencies such as the FBI and the DEA.  Both sides agreed that 
the existing bilateral extradition treaty is outdated and 
needs to be replaced.  The Attorney General explained that an 
updated bilateral protocol to the US-EU extradition agreement 
would have to be negotiated in the future.  Justice Minister 
Nemec asked the US to reconsider its visa policy.  The 
Attorney General said he would share this with Secretary 
Powell in a meeting the following week. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
INTERIOR: GOODWILL, COOPERATION, AND A PERSONAL REQUEST 
 
 
2. (SBU) The Attorney General\'s meeting with Interior 
Minister Frantisek Bublan was characterized by gratitude on 
both sides for the level of successful and necessary 
cooperation between US and Czech law enforcement agencies, 
particularly the FBI and the DEA.  The one problem that was 
raised was the outdated bilateral extradition treaty, which, 
both agreed, needed to be replaced.  The Attorney General 
explained that he was in Europe to sign recently negotiated 
MLATs and extradition treaties with six of the 15 \"old\" 
members of the EU, and added that, while the US is 
negotiating with the EU-15 before doing the same with the 
countries that acceded this May, he was confident that some 
day there would be a similar signing with the Czech Republic. 
 Minister Bublan said he would like to learn from the 
instruments the AG is signing as it is likely that the future 
agreement with the Czech Republic would be along similar 
lines. 
 
3. (SBU) Minister Bublan closed the meeting with a personal 
request for the US government to help transport 2 armored 
vehicles to Baghdad, where they would be used by a security 
detail at the Czech Embassy in Iraq.  This request has 
already been passed through Embassy Prague\'s Defense Attache 
Office to Washington and EUCOM. 
 
JUSTICE: A FRANKER EXCHANGE ON EXTRADITION OF NATIONALS AND 
VISAS 
 
4. (SBU) The Attorney general\'s meeting with Justice Minister 
and Deputy PM Pavel Nemec also began with his expressions of 
gratitude for the Czech\'s demonstrated commitment to the rule 
of law, and for their contributions in the fight against 
terrorism.  He specifically expressed his thanks for keeping 
the Czech military policemen in Iraq until after next month\'s 
elections.  The AG also explained that the purpose of his 
trip was to sign recently concluded MLATs and extradition 
treaties with several EU states.  He added that the US has 
been working since 1997 on an updated extradition treaty with 
the Czech Republic and that he was \"eager to move forward on 
this.\"  The AG explained that the other EU states had, with 
regard to the question of extradition of nationals, taken 
what he referred to as \"a mature position,\" and said he hoped 
that the Czech Republic would see that it is in their 
interest to have an updated treaty. 
 
5. (SBU) Minister Nemec responded that he was also grateful 
for the existing level of cooperation on law enforcement. 
With regard to Iraq,  he said,  \"It was appropriate for a 
member of the alliance to act as we did.\"  Addressing the 
issue of extradition of nationals,  Nemec explained that this 
is a politically sensitive point.  He argued that the 
prevailing interpretation of the constitution, at least among 
the lawmakers he knows, is that the Czech constitution does 
not allow it. 
 
6. (SBU) Finally, on the touchy subject of US visas for Czech 
citizens,  the AG said the US Government sees the Czech 
Republic as a nation of growing economic prosperity and 
international influence.  He said he knows President Bush 
favors easy access for legitimate travelers, especially those 
from friendly nations, and pointed out that a bilateral 
working group is trying to improve the application procedure 
for Czechs wanting to travel to the US.  Nemec responded by 
asking the US to reconsider its visa policy.  He said this is 
a \"very sensitive problem,\" and explained that while, on the 
one hand, the US and the Czech Republic have great relations, 
on the other hand, Czechs feel discriminated against since 
citizens of many other EU states don\'t need visas to visit 
the US.  The AG promised to \"communicate your concerns\" to 
the Secretary of State in a meeting the following week.

Classified By: Deputy Political Counselor Mark Canning for reasons 1.4 
(a) (b) (c) and (g) 
 
1. THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  SEE PARA 7 
 
2. (C) As foreshadowed in Reftel A, the Czech Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs is, for the second time this year, soliciting 
US opinion on the possible sale of a Czech-produced passive 
radar system to Pakistan. 
 
3.  (C) As in the previous case, dealt with in Reftels B and 
C, this MFA request is based on a request from the Czech firm 
ERA to begin preliminary marketing discussions with the Air 
Force of Pakistan. Unlike the previous case, the proposed 
sale would not involve the passive system VERA-E, but an 
earlier, less powerful model of passive radar, the ASDD-01. 
 
4. (C) Reftel C describes U.S. concerns over a possible 
reexport of the VERA-E to China as the primary reason for 
opposing a VERA-E sale to Pakistan. The U.S. concern played 
an important role in the decision by the GOCR in July to deny 
ERA permission to move forward with marketing the system to 
Pakistan. The firm has recently approached the MFA with new 
information about the sale of a Swedish radar system, the 
Erieye, to Pakistan. The Erieye is made by Ericsson Microwave 
Systems and is described as an active, phased-array 
pulse-Doppler radar that can be used for Airborne Early 
Warning and Control Systems. The firm provided news reports 
stating Pakistan will purchase seven copies of the Eireye. 
 
5. (C) The firm argues that the ASDD-01 is based on the same 
technology as the Erieye.  In addition the firm has offered 
to discuss reexport concerns.  The firm made the suggestions 
that GPS equipment be included in the hardware to identify 
its location, and that unannounced spot checks of the 
equipment be agreed to in any potential contract. 
 
6. (C) Comment: In presenting the formal request for USG 
views on the proposed sale during a meeting on Dec 22, Czech 
MFA staff pointed out the huge symbolic benefits of any sale, 
even a non VERA sale. The GOCR, and the MFA in particular, 
which were publicly criticized for halting earlier requests 
to market VERA, are now under renewed public and private 
pressure from the politically-influential ERA to license 
exports.  As MFA staff did not hesitate to point out, good 
news on a high-profile sale like this would boost the ability 
of the weak Czech government to win approval for 
controversial policy moves, such as the further extension of 
Czech troops in Iraq.  End Comment. 
 
7. Please provide response in the next 90 days, if possible, 
to the Czech request for Washington advisory opinion.

SUBJECT: RFE/RL GETS \"NEW LEASE\" ON LIFE IN PRAGUE 
 
 
1.  (U) Sensitive But Unclassified - Not for Internet 
Distribution. 
 
2.  (SBU) The Czech cabinet announced on December 22 the 
approval of a new lease for Prague-based Radio Free 
Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), which will extend their tenure 
in their current headquarters building until December 31, 
2007.  The current five-year lease was due to expire at the 
end of this month, but GOCR officials had repeatedly assured 
us that the lease would be extended to cover the USG 
projected schedule of time necessary to move the radios to a 
safer location in Prague.  Due to a technical change in Czech 
law, a new lease was approved, rather than an extension of 
the current lease, but the conditions of the agreement remain 
the same. The government\'s decision was announced with little 
fanfare, and leading news outlets carried straightforward 
accounts noting that the lease was extended while the search 
for an alternate location remains ongoing. 
 
3.  (SBU) Otherwise, the search for a new location remains on 
track, with four companies submitting bids on November 23 to 
build a new headquarters for approximately 600 employees of 
the radios.  A multi-disciplinary team in Washington, with 
representatives from State OBO and the Broadcasting Board of 
Governors, is currently evaluating the bids, with a final 
decision planned for early in 2005.  Once a site is selected, 
the Embassy and Czech officials have pledged to use best 
efforts to fast-track the permitting process (an unusually 
tedious and bureaucratic process in this country that can 
easily take up to 12 months).  With this lease extension, 
progress on the RFE/RL relocation once again takes a giant 
step forward, to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.

SUBJECT: CZECH SUBMISSION FOR 2004-2005 INCSR, PART II 
MONEY LAUNDERING AND FINANCIAL CRIMES 
 
REF: 254401 
 
1.  Both geographic and economic factors render the Czech 
Republic vulnerable to money laundering. Tax fraud, narcotics 
trafficking, smuggling, auto theft, embezzlement, 
racketeering and trafficking in persons are the major sources 
of funds that are laundered in the Czech Republic. Domestic 
and foreign organized crime groups target Czech financial 
institutions for laundering activity; banks, currency 
exchanges, casinos and other gaming establishments, 
investment companies, and real estate agencies have all been 
used to launder criminal proceeds. 
2..  The Czech anti-money laundering legislation, Act No 
61/1996, Measures against Legalization of Proceeds from 
Criminal Activity, went into effect in July 1996. An 
amendment in 2000 requires a wide range of financial 
institutions to report all suspicious transaction to the 
financial analytical unit (FAU) of the Ministry of Finance 
and to freeze assets that belong to people listed by the UN 
Sanction committee. They also have to freeze all assets of 
subjects that belong directly or indirectly to subjects named 
on the UN Security Council list. The latest amendment that 
came into force in September 2004 brought several major 
changes and harmonized Czech legislation with the Second EU 
directive. The amendment extends the list of entities which 
must report transactions to attorneys, casinos, realtors, 
notaries, accountants, tax auditors, and entrepreneurs with 
transactions exceeding the EU-standard 15,000 euros. All 
listed financial institutions also have a new obligation to 
report not only suspicious transactions possibly involving 
money laundering, but also those that might be connected to 
the financing of terrorism.  In connection with that, the FAU 
is now authorized to share all information with the Czech 
Intelligence Service and the Czech National Security Bureau. 
It is hoped that this will improve the timeliness and nature 
of exchanges between the different agencies within the Czech 
government. However, the real effectiveness of communication 
from BIS and the National Security Bureau to the FAU remains 
to be tested. The FAU is newly authorized to cooperate and 
share information not only with other members of Egmont Group 
but also with other counterparts or international 
organizations under certain circumstances. 
3.  The Financial Analytical Unit, the Czech counterpart of 
Fincen, can only investigate accounts for which reports of 
suspicious transactions have been filled. FAU is an 
administrative unit without law enforcement authority. FAU 
can ask the banking sector to check for an account in the 
name of specific individual or organization. But FAU cannot 
order the check, or conduct the investigation itself. While 
post believes FAU conducts its investigations in an 
appropriate manner, those investigations only cover a tiny 
fraction of accounts in the country.  Moreover, their primary 
purpose has been and remains identifying tax evaders. 
 
4.  The financial institution that reports the suspicious 
transaction can freeze the account of its client for 24 
hours. This can be extended to 72 hours to give FAU time to 
find out whether there is any evidence of a crime. If there 
is, the case is forwarded to the financial police, who have 
another three days to gather necessary evidence. If enough 
evidence can be gathered to persuade a judge, the police and 
prosecutor continue their work and the account stays frozen 
throughout the investigation and prosecution, which could 
last months and years. If the judge isn,t satisfied with the 
evidence gathered within the 72-hour period, the funds must 
be released. These limits do not apply to accounts owned by 
individuals or organizations on the UN,s list of terrorists. 
 
5.  In July 2002, an amendment to the Criminal Code became 
effective. This amendment introduced a new, independent 
offense called &Legalization of Proceeds from Crime.8 It 
enables prosecution for legalization (laundering) of proceeds 
from all serious criminal activity punishable by up to five 
years of imprisonment if the person is as a member of an 
organized group or obtains considerable benefits from such 
offence. A sentence of eight years or forfeiture of property 
can be imposed for legalizing the proceeds from drug 
trafficking or other very serious crimes, or if the person 
commits the offence by abusing his official position. The 
latest amendment of the Criminal Code, that came into force 
in November 2004,  adds new definitions for terrorist attacks 
and for financing of terrorism. A penalty of up to 15 years 
of imprisonment can be imposed on those who support 
terrorists financially, materially or with other means. 
6.  An extensive revision of the Criminal Procedure Code, 
which facilitated the seizure and forfeiture of bank 
accounts, became effective January 1, 2002. It allows a 
judge, and in preliminary prosecution, a prosecutor or the 
police (with consent of a prosecutor) to freeze an account if 
the evidence shows that the financial means will be used to 
commit a crime, were used to commit a crime, or are proceeds 
from criminal activity. In urgent cases the police can also 
freeze the account without previous consent of the 
prosecutor, but to have to inform the prosecutor within 48 
hours, who then confirms the freeze or releases the funds. 
The Law on the Administration of Asset Forfeiture in Criminal 
Procedure, passed in August 2003, implements provisions on 
the  handling and care of seized property.  That became 
effective on January 1, 2004. 
7.  For years, the Czech Republic had been criticized for 
allowing anonymous passbook accounts to exist within the 
banking system. Legislation adopted in 2000 prohibited new 
anonymous passbook accounts. In 2002, the Act on Banks was 
amended to abolish all existing bearer passbooks by December 
31, 2002, and by June 2003, approximately 400 million euros 
had been converted. While account holders can still withdraw 
money from the accounts for the next decade, the accounts do 
not earn interest and cannot accept deposits. 
8.  The number of suspicious transaction reports transmitted 
to the FAU has increased significantly, while the number of 
reports evaluated and forwarded to law enforcement remains 
unchanged. This is interpreted as evidence of the active 
participation of mandated entities in the anti-money 
laundering regime. After clarifications to the reporting 
requirements in 1996, reporting rose from 95 unusual 
transactions per annum (1996) to 1,750 suspicious 
transactions in 2001, 1,260 in 2002, 1,970 in 2003 and 3,018 
from January through November 2004. The number of reports 
forwarded to the police increased from none the first year to 
115 in 2002 and 114 in 2003. From January through November 
2004 there were 90 reports forwarded to police; every case 
that was passed to law enforcement was investigated. 
9.  In July 2004, a new specialized police unit called the 
Financial Police (known also as Illegal Proceeds and Tax 
Crime Unit) was established. The Department of Criminal 
Proceeds and Money Laundering, which used to be part of the 
unit fighting organized crime, became a part of the newly 
established Financial Police.  It is still the main law 
enforcement counterpart to FAU, a partnership which has led 
to the first formal charges on money laundering. 
10.  In 2004, the Department of Criminal Proceeds and Money 
Laundering investigated 139 cases and secured assets valued 
at roughly US$90,000. This compares to 2003 when police 
secure approximately US$29,000 113 cases. In 2004 the 
department participated in 25 cases investigated by the Czech 
National Drug Headquarters and secured assets valued at 
US$700,000.  In 2003, 23 cases related to drug crimes were 
investigated and the department succeeded in securing assets 
valued at US$7,250,000. 
11.  The Ministry of Justice statistics for the first half of 
2004 show the first two convictions for attempting to 
legalize the proceeds of crime. The only penalties imposed 
were a suspended sentence and a fine. 4 people were 
prosecuted and 3 were accused, one case was suspended. In 
2003 there were 36 cases, five cases were suspended, 7 people 
were prosecuted and 7 were accused.  There were no 
convictions in 2003. One ongoing issue is that in the Czech 
Republic, law enforcement must prove that the assets in 
question were derived from criminal activity. The accused is 
not obligated to prove that the property or assets were 
acquired legitimately. 
12.  The Czech Government has approved the 2004 National 
Action Plan for the Fight against Terrorism. This document 
covers themes ranging from police work and cooperation to 
protection of security interests, enhancement of security 
standards, and customs issues. The FAU currently is 
distributing &terrorist lists8 to relevant financial and 
governmental bodies. Czechs now do have specific laws 
criminalizing terrorist financing and have legislation 
permitting rapid implementation of UN and EU financial 
sanctions, including action against accounts held by 
suspected terrorist entities or individuals. A new government 
body called the Clearinghouse was instituted in October 2002, 
under the FAU; its function is to streamline input from 
institutions in order to enhance cooperation and response to 
a terrorist threat. 
13.  Czech authorities have been cooperative in the global 
effort to identify suspect terrorist accounts (FAU has 
checked the accounts of about a thousand people since the 
September 11, 2001) but no accounts have been identified, and 
no terrorist assets have been confiscated. 
14.  The Czech Republic became a signatory to the UN 
International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing 
of Terrorism in September 2000, but has not yet ratified it. 
The main obstacle to ratification is the absence of 
legislation on criminal liability of legal persons 
(companies). This legislation has been proposed and will 
become a part of the whole recodification of the Criminal 
Code that authorities hope will take effect in 2006.  In the 
meantime, the government is trying to identify a different 
way through administrative or civil procedure to satisfy 
Convention requirements. 
15.  The Czech Republic is a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention and the World Customs Organization\'s Convention on 
Mutual Administrative Assistance for the Prevention 
Investigation and Repression of Customs Offenses. An 
extradition treaty and an MLAT are in force between the U.S. 
and the Czech Republic, though the extradition treaty is 80 
years old, based on outdated mutual lists, and does not allow 
the extradition of Czech nationals to the US. The Czech 
Republic has taken the necessary legislative measures to join 
the European Arrest Warrant.  However, the EAW has not been 
used and there is sharp debate about whether the Czech 
constitution even allows the extradition of nationals. It is 
hoped that a test case will resolve the issue in 2005. 
Formalization of an agreement between the Czech Republic and 
Europol took place in 2002. The agreement allows an exchange 
of information about specific crimes and investigating 
methods, the prevention of crime, and the training of police. 
Among the most important crimes cited in the cooperation 
agreement are terrorism, drug trafficking, and money 
laundering. 
16.  The FAU is a member of the Egmont Group, and is 
authorized to cooperate with its foreign counterparts, 
including those not part of the Egmont Group. The Czech 
Republic is a party to the Strasbourg Convention and actively 
participates in the Council of Europe,s Select Committee of 
Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures 
(MONEYVAL) as both evaluator and &evaluatee,8 and in 2001 
underwent a mutual evaluation by the Committee. The Czech 
Republic continues to implement changes to its anti-money 
laundering regime based on the results of the mutual 
evaluation. In May 2003, the Czech Republic also underwent a 
financial sector assessment by the World Bank/IMF. The Czech 
Republic is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and in 
December 2000 signed, but has not yet ratified, the UN 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Czechs 
wants to ratify the Convention together with its three 
supplemental Protocols which cause the delay in ratification. 
The Czech Republic also is a party to the Council of Europe 
Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of 
the Proceeds from Crime. 
17.  The Czech Republic should continue to enhance its 
anti-money laundering regime and should become a party to the 
UN International Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism. In addition, the Czech Republic 
should continue to work toward supporting and streamlining 
its prosecution regime, including shifting the burden of 
proof from the prosecutor to the defendant. The question of 
compensation of damages in cases of acquittal also needs to 
be solved. The Czech Republic should also take steps to 
facilitate the forfeiture of assets jointly owned, for 
example by husband and wife.  This is very complicated at the 
moment. The possible confiscation of property as substitution 
for illicit proceeds, would also be helpful.

SUBJECT: CZECH SUBMISSION FOR 2004-2005 INCSR PART 1, DRUGS 
AND CHEMICAL CONTROL 
 
REF: 249035 
 
1. SUMMARY. Illegal narcotics are imported to, manufactured 
in, and consumed in the Czech Republic. Marijuana, both 
imported, and to a much lesser extent grown locally, is used 
more than any other drug. Consumption of marijuana continues 
to grow, particularly among the young. The popularity of 
Ecstasy (MDMA) is also growing, especially among the young 
and &dance scene8 visitors, who consider it 
a&recreational8 drug. According to the ESPAD report for 
2003,  more than twice as many Czech students (44%) used 
marijuana or hashish than the ESPAD average (21%). 
Similarly,  twice as many Czech students (12%) used some 
other illicit drug than the ESPAD average (6%. The government 
has taken note of these trends and has altered its drug 
strategy for the next 5 years to include more anti drug 
education for the young.  On the positive side, the use of 
what the Czechs call problem drugs, such as heroin or the 
amphetamine Pervetine, decreased  slightly.  The level of 
cocaine use remains very low. Tobacco and alcohol consumption 
is very high. The Czech Republic is a producer of ephedrine, 
a precursor for Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS) and a 
producer of lysergic acid, ergometrine and ergotamine, used 
for production of LSD. 
 
Status of Country 
2.  Several factors make the Czech Republic an attractive 
country for groups in the drug trade. These factors include 
its central location, the closure of most of the traditional 
customs posts along the nation,s borders as part of EU 
accession in 2004, low detection rates for laundered drug 
money, low risk of asset confiscation, and relatively short 
sentences for drug-related crimes. The maximum sentence for 
any drug-related crime is 15 years. 
3.  The Czech National Focal Point for Drugs and Drug 
Addiction, which became fully operational in January 2003, is 
the main body responsible for collecting, analyzing and 
interpreting data on drug use.  It issues an annual report on 
the drug situation in the Czech Republic and cooperates 
closely with the European Center for Monitoring Drugs and 
Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). 
 
4.  The Focal Point report for 2003 indicates that the number 
of problem drug users is approximately 30, 000  (19,000 
Pervitine and 11,000 heroin users). This represents a 15% 
drop from the estimate of 35,000 problem users for the 
previous year.  Between 80 and 90 % of this group are 
intravenous drug users.  Focal point estimates that 60% of 
problem drug users are in regular contact with treatment 
centers, and drop-in centers.  Health officials say there 
were only 4 new cases of HIV  among problem drug users in 
2003.  They attribute the relatively low numbers of HIV and 
hepatitis infections to the fact that the majority of IV drug 
users are in contact with treatment centers and drop-in 
centers which offer needle exchange. 
 
5.  Authorities offer differing explanations for the decrease 
in heroin use. Some attribute it to effective substitution 
treatment with buprenorphin or methadone. Others, 
particularly among police officials, say the heroin market 
was unstable and lower amounts of heroin were available. 
 
6.  While the use of heroin declined significantly, 
consumption of softer drugs such as marijuana and Ecstasy 
increased in 2003. The annual report by the European School 
Survey Project on Alcohol and other Drugs (ESPAD) showed an 
increase in marijuana use from 34.8 % in 1999 to 43.6 % in 
2003.  Similarly, Ecstasy use grew from 3.4% in 1999 to 8.3% 
in 2003. The ESPAD report also highlighted increased trend in 
cigarettes smoking and alcohol consumption among 16 years 
olds. The report also confirms the decrease in experimental 
use of heroin and Pervitine. 
7.  One third of children have their first experience with 
legal drugs (tobacco and alcohol) at the age of 11. Children 
try illegal drugs, primarily marijuana, at the age of 14-16. 
While the average age of heroin users went up in 2003, 
suggesting fewer new young addicts, the average age of those 
using drugs with lower health risks went down. 
Country Actions Against Drugs in 2003 
8.  Policy Initiatives. There is an ongoing debate in the 
Czech government and society over whether there should be a 
more liberal line taken in regard to soft drugs,  in order to 
focus on hard drugs. In March, 2004,  the Christian Democrats 
announced their war on drugs, which, with its stricter policy 
on marijuana ran counter to the then prevailing liberal line 
of the government,s drug policy.   Due the important 
position of the Christian Democrats in the governing 
coalition, the preparation of the government,s drug policies 
for 2005-2009, as well as preparation for the recodification 
of the nation,s penal code, were interrupted. The proposed 
changes to the Penal Code would have divided drugs into soft 
and hard. That division and consequent lower penalties for 
soft drugs were behind the debate that led to the dismissal 
of Josef Radimecky, the man who until early December, 2004 
was the head of the body responsible for government drug 
policy.  But on one of the last business days of 2004 the 
government approved  the next five-year plan on drug 
strategy,  to a large extent along the lines suggested 
earlier by Radimecky.  The plan focuses on the fight against 
organized gangs that provide drugs, and taking steps to 
further lower the number of addicts. 
9.  Based on the results of an internal audit, the National 
Drug Headquarters, the main institution responsible for major 
drug cases, changed its organizational structure in June, 
2004.  They now have only two departments - focused on 
natural drugs; and on synthetic drugs and precursors. This 
structure allows much better coordination of existing cases 
and enables them to establish task forces. In the past there 
were six departments focusing on particular drugs (heroin, 
ecstasy, marijuana) or particular organized groups (Asians, 
ethnic Albanians, Africans, Russian speaking groups etc). The 
original structure showed problems in cases when a certain 
criminal group was involved in more than one activity and 
dealt with more than one kind of drug. The National Drug 
Headquarters also strengthened cooperation with The Financial 
Police Unit, which was established in July 2004 under the 
Ministry of the Interior. 
10.  The General Directorate of Customs underwent major 
changes in 2004 as part of the Czech Republic,s entry into 
the EU.  All of the traditional customs posts along the 
nation,s borders with Poland, German, Austria, and Slovakia, 
other EU states, were closed. The only remaining 
international customs post is at Prague,s International 
Airport.  8 mobile customs teams have also been set up and 
these teams now conduct random checks along highways, in 
warehouse, and at marketplaces. 
11.  The drug unit of the Czech Customs Service gained new 
responsibilities such as monitoring transports, and imports 
and exports of precursors from and to third countries. 
Beginning in January, 2005, they will also be responsible for 
monitoring the growth of poppies and technical cannabis 
(containing less than 2%THC). This monitoring used to be done 
by the Czech Ministry of Agriculture. 
Accomplishments 
12.  In the first half of 2004, the National Drug 
Headquarters, together with the Custom Service, seized 5.66 
kg of heroin; 35 691 ecstasy pills; 1.5 kg of 
methamphetamine, 26 kilograms of marihuana, 729 cannabis 
plants, 5.17 kg of hashish, 0.5 kilograms of ephedrine and 3 
kilograms of cocaine. They also found 105 laboratories for 
methamphetamine production. 
13.  There were several prominent arrests in the second half 
of the year. In November 2004, the National Drug 
Headquarters, in cooperation with Custom Service, arrested a 
five-member gang, two Czechs and three foreigners, suspected 
of organizing the export of heroin from the Czech Republic. 
The police seized 27 kilograms of heroin but suspect them of 
having smuggled roughly 220 kilograms of heroin to other 
European countries. 
14.  In cooperation with specialists from the U.S., Holland, 
Israel and Belgium, In September, 2004, the Czech National 
Drug Headquarters arrested the head of a Czech-Israeli gang 
that organized the export of ecstasy from Europe to the Los 
Angeles. 300,000 tablets were seized in the U.S.  Two Czechs 
were arrested in Austria while receiving payment for the 
sale. 
15.  According to the police statistics for the first half of 
2004, 1123 people were investigated for drug related crimes. 
1086 suspects were investigated for unauthorized production 
and possession of narcotics and psychotropic substances and 
poisons. 88 others were investigated for drug possession for 
personal use, and 37 were investigated for spreading 
addiction.  Comparisons with 2003 and 2002 are attached. 
 
16.  According to the statistics provided by the Ministry of 
Justice for the first half of 2004, the state prosecuted 1581 
suspects and accused 1389 others for drug related crimes. 
203 were accused of drug possession for personal use and 195 
were accused of spreading addiction. Courts have convicted 
693 people; among those there were 32 convictions for drug 
possession for personal use and 22 for spreading addiction. 
Comparisons with 2003 and 2002 are attached. 
 
17.  Statistics for year 2003 show that most of the convicted 
criminals (60%) receive conditional sentences for drug 
related crimes and only one fourth of convicted criminals is 
sentenced to serve time.  Only 14% of this latter group 
receive sentences higher then 5 years. The majority (72%) of 
those given prison sentences receive from 1 to 5 years.  For 
details see below. 
Corruption 
18.  Possession of a small amount of drugs is considered an 
administrative offence and possession of more than a small 
amount a criminal offence. The vague definition of what is a 
&small amount8 opened up the possibility for police 
corruption, allowing some venal officers to construe any 
amount as &small8 and treat the offense as an 
administrative one. To avoid any possible confusion and to 
eliminate possibilities for corruption, the Police President 
and Supreme Public Prosecutor issued internal regulations 
designed to clarify elements of the drug law that some feared 
allowed policemen too much discretion in whether to pursue 
drug cases. 
19.  In 2003 10 police officers committed drug related 
crimes. There were 9 cases of production and distribution of 
drugs, and 1 case of spreading addiction. Four of the 10 
police officials received sentences from four to nine years 
for trying to sell five kilograms of heroin, part of a larger 
amount confiscated in an earlier case. A prosecutor and his 
superior arranged for part of a drug seizure to avoid 
destruction and then arranged with two policemen to sell the 
heroin. In 2002 only 4 police officers committed drug related 
crimes (3 cases of production and distribution and 1 case of 
spreading addiction. All those cases were conditionally 
suspended. 
20.  Agreements and Treaties. The Czech Republic is a party 
to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and the World Customs 
Organization\'s Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance 
for the Prevention Investigation and Repression of Customs 
Offenses. An extradition treaty and an MLAT are in force 
between the U.S. and the Czech Republic, though the 
extradition treaty is 80 years old, based on outdated mutual 
lists, and does not allow the extradition of Czech nationals 
to the US. The Czech Republic has taken the necessary 
legislative measures to join the European Arrest Warrant. 
However, the EAW has not been used and there is sharp debate 
about whether the Czech constitution even allows the 
extradition of nationals. It is hoped that a test case will 
resolve the issue in 2005. The Czech Republic has signed, but 
not yet ratified, the UN Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime. 
Drug Flow/Transit 
21.  Marijuana cultivation used to be primarily for personal 
use only. However the police recently found many laboratories 
where the drug was cultivated hydroponically.  Police 
discovered three big laboratories in the first half of the 
year. The marijuana growers stated that they were encouraged 
by the signals of the government,s more liberal drug policy 
against soft drugs. Marijuana is also imported from Holland 
and more recently from Morocco via Spain. 
22.  Czech police focused their activities on ethnic Albanian 
drug gangs that import heroin mainly from Afghanistan via 
Iran and Turkey. There were no reports of imports of white 
heroin from Thailand or Burma. Heroin sometimes transits the 
Czech Republic via the Balkan Route to Northern and Western 
Europe. But police believe shipments are now smaller and more 
frequent, unlike the big heroin cases of the past. 
23.  Cocaine is mainly exported to the Czech Republic through 
Holland. It usually then transits through to Northern and 
Western Europe. It is delivered most often to the Czech 
Republic by individual travelers returning from visits abroad 
or by mail. Czech drug couriers mainly use the airport in 
Amsterdam where the cooperation with the local police is very 
complicated in terms of arrest. The local police more often 
than not confiscate the drug, but do not start prosecution. 
Due to the price of cocaine, to the degree it is used in the 
Czech Republic, it is mainly consumed by the middle and upper 
classes. 
24.  Pervitine, a synthetic amphetamine, is produced mainly 
by Czechs, primarily for local consumption. It is often 
produced in home laboratories where ephedrine, the main 
ingredient in Pervitine, is extracted from pills that are 
freely available. One Czech company, INC Roztoky u Prahy, had 
been producing tens of tons of ephedrine annually.  INC 
announced a production pause on 17 May, 2004, in connection 
with plans to sell the factory or the production technology. 
Neither of those two options have taken place, but all 
ephedrine stocks have been sold, mainly to the USA ( Novus; 
cca 30 tons), South Africa (cca 3 tons), Argentina and Brazil 
or to local companies. It looks as though INC plans to 
restart its production in 2005.  Pervitine is exported mainly 
to Germany and to a lesser extent to Austria. Czech knowledge 
of Pervitine production has also been exported to neighboring 
Slovakia. 
 
25.  Ecstasy, still the favorite drug of the &dance scene,8 
is imported mainly from Holland and Belgium. The import is 
organized among smaller, closed groups or individuals however 
the amounts of drug shipments are growing. Most ecstasy in 
the Czech Republic is in pill form.  There are no indicators 
for production of ecstasy or making pills from powder 
ecstasy. 
26.  The Ministry of Agriculture monitors the growth and sale 
of poppies that are cultivated for poppy seeds sold to EU 
markets or used in traditional Czech cooking. Total 
production in 2003/2004 (July 2003-June 2004) was 19,544 tons 
(16,918 tons in 2002/2003). 80 - 90% of production is 
exported. The Czech Customs Service will be responsible for 
monitoring growth as well as exports beginning January 2005. 
Domestic Programs (Demand Reduction). 
27.  School prevention programs have been and continue to be 
the most common prevention programs. Different after-school 
activities are organized by NGOs. The number of contact 
centers that provide needle exchange is growing. In 2003 1.7 
million needles were distributed. 
28.  In 2003, the state budget provided 317 million Czech 
Crowns, or $13.7 million to national drug programs and an 
additional 48 million Crowns, or  $2.1 million directly to 
the regions. The Government Commission for Coordination of 
Drug Policy received $4.45 million for projects at the local 
level, up from the 2002 amount of US$3.75 million. 
29.  The Commission needs to coordinate with other 
institutions to make sure that the resources for prevention 
and treatments programs will be spent wisely. It has been 
criticized for supporting programs to test the purity of 
ecstasy at &dance-parties8 in the past. Since there are 
many preventive as well as treatment programs and a lot of 
them are not very effective, the Committee came up with a 
proposal to evaluate programs, based on the &service 
minimum.8  At the same time, the Ministry of Health has 
supported establishment of a research and development project 
that focuses on evaluation of drug prevention and treatment 
programs. 
30.  The U.S. Department of State supports the prevention 
efforts of Lions\' Club, Lions\' Quest Program. Children are 
taught at elementary schools how to live a healthy life 
without drugs. This program, supported by the Ministry of 
Health and Ministry of Education, is now being implemented at 
several schools. 
Bilateral Cooperation 
31.  Czech police consider cooperation with the U.S., German, 
Austria, Israel, Switzerland and the UK as very good. Czech 
and German police continue to cooperate in Operation 
&Crystal8 to combat Pervitine trafficking. 
U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs 
Bilateral Cooperation. 
 
32.  The U.S. covers Czech Republic drug issues through the 
DEA office in Berlin.  They maintain an extremely active and 
cooperative relationship with Czech counterparts, 
particularly with the National Drug Headquarters.  DEA 
cooperates with NDH on investigations. DEA also assists with 
organizational changes at NDH and has provided training. The 
State Department has given grants for counternarcotics 
education and has provided equipment and training for customs 
officers. 
The Road Ahead 
33.  In the first half of the year the Government Commission 
for Coordination of Drug Policy did an analysis of Czech drug 
policy.  Based on the results of their analysis, they 
proposed a new drug policy strategy for 2005-2009. They 
proposed a general document to which they would add two 
action plans for 2005-2006 and 2007-2008. The priority will 
be given to public health concerns, including a balance 
between drug supply, demand reduction and risk minimization, 
and standardization and quality assurance of services such as 
primary prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. The 
government now runs nine drug treatment/substitution centers 
and wants to increase the number of these centers. The 
government also wants to implement a certification scheme for 
NGOs providing these services. Legal drugs, tobacco and 
alcohol, became another priority of the government. They want 
to focus more on misuse of these drugs by children, based on 
the latest research results. This strategy hasn,t been 
approved yet due to political differences over drug policy. 
34.  The Interior Minister intends to seek legislation 
approving undercover &buy-bust8 type operations and use of 
criminal informants, which he feels would help catch 
criminals and corrupt officials involved in the drug trade. 
The bill is prepared but hasn,t begun the legislative 
approval process. 
Chemical Control 
 
35.  The Czech Republic has a well-developed chemical 
industry and is a producer of precursors.  There are two main 
companies - INC Roztoky u Prahy, which annually produces tens 
of tons of ephedrine, which can be used to make the 
methamphetamine Pervitine;and IVEX (formerly Galena a.s. 
Ostrava), which annually produces hundreds of thousands of 
kilos of lysergic acid, ergometrine and ergotamine, which are 
used in the production of LSD.  Both companies are members of 
the Association of Chemical producers of the Czech Republic. 
A third company, Farmak a.s., imports ephedrine from India 
(in the past from Germany) to make medication against 
Parkinson,s disease.  INC announced a production pause on 17 
May, 2004, in connection to plans to sell the factory or the 
production technology. Neither of those two options have 
taken place, but all ephedrine stocks have been sold, mainly 
to USA ( Novus; cca 30 tons), South Africa (cca 3 tons), 
Argentina and Brazil or to local companies. It looks as 
though INC plans to restart its production. 
 
36.  The Czech Republic has signed the UN Conventions on 
Narcotic Drugs, on Psychotropic Substances, and against 
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances. Chemical control in the Czech Republic is 
regulated under law No. 167/1998 Col. on Addictive 
Substances. Addictive substances are regulated with national 
legislation; EU legislation regulates only trade in 
precursors and essential chemicals (EEC No 3677/90). The last 
amendment to the Czech Law on Addictive Substances from May 
2004 (No 466/2004 Col) fully harmonized the law with EU 
requirements; it changed Czech legislation mainly in the area 
of import and export of precursors and in the area of 
registration of producers, exporters, importers and sellers 
of essential chemicals. Czech legislation was much stricter 
than EU law before the amendment especially in the area of 
import of precursors where the Czech Ministry of Industry and 
Trade had to issue import license. Since 1 July 2004 any 
import licenses are not required but based on a very good 
cooperation with companies that import precursors the 
Ministry of Health still receives information about imports. 
This &step back8 was one of the requirements of EU for 
Czech EU membership. The current development in the EU in the 
area of precursors is taking direction of previous experience 
of new EU members like the Czech and Slovak Republic where 
the import licenses for precursors were required. It is 
expected that the current legislation will need to be changed 
again, probably in August 2005. For exports of precursors the 
Ministry still issues the export licenses but newly on 
special papers that cannot be duplicated (with special safety 
measures, such as holograms)  The Ministry would appreciate 
regular confirmation of receipt, especially from US 
companies. 
 
37.  Currently, substances in the Czech Republic are divided 
into four groups:  (1) narcotic and (2) psychotropic 
substances, (3) precursors and (4) essential chemicals. 
Groups 1, 2 and 3 require stricter rules; there has to be an 
&authorization for handling8 approved by the Ministry of 
Health.  No national authorization is required of pharmacists 
or doctors because regional offices control them. Group 4 
required registration of all people that are somehow involved 
with the export, import, production or sale of the essential 
chemicals. The new amendment from May 2005 now allows 
exceptions in handling as well as exporting of certain 
amounts of essential chemicals without any obligation to 
register at Ministry of Health.  This change and easier 
administration benefits companies with smaller consignments. 
 
38.  The Inspectorate of Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances 
of the Czech Ministry of Health, that monitors producers and 
dealers of precursors, is involved in the international 
monitoring operations Purple (control of potassium 
permanganate, used for cocaine production) and Topaz (control 
of acetic anhydride, used for heroin production).  Czech 
Republic has joined operation Prism, (control of ephedrine 
used for Pervitine production) but hasn,t started control 
procedures yet.  The Czech police and custom officers are 
still in the process of identifying the necessary mechanisms. 
 
39.  The Inspectorate also monitors distribution to 
pharmacies and the consumption of certain medicines and 
precursors (e.g ephedrine) because some pills that contain 
these substances, used for Pervitine production, are 
available without special prescriptions These pills contain 
less than 30 mg of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. All the 
information about consumption/distribution is provided to the 
National Drug Headquarters for their use while monitoring 
illegal production of Pervitine. The National Drug 
Headquarters is responsible for the detection of the abuse of 
precursors. 
 
40.  In 2001 the Ministry of Interior initiated the signing 
of a &Memorandum of Understanding8 between the police and 
customs service and the associations of the chemical and 
pharmaceuticals industry.  Companies agreed in the Memorandum 
to announce any suspicious purchases or sales. Several 
investigations have already been initiated based on such 
tips. 
 
41.  The General Directorate of Customs (under Ministry of 
Finance) undertook major changes during 2004 as part of Czech 
entry to EU.  Since the Czech Republic is surrounded by other 
EU states, the traditional border posts were closed and 
hundreds of staff were transferred to other assignments. 
Those border posts were great sources of information, and 
their closure has made the work of custom officers much more 
difficult especially in the area of monitoring movements to 
and from the country. The only remaining international 
customs check is at Prague,s airport.  Random checks are 
conducted by mobile teams along highways, at warehouses, or 
marketplaces.  The Czech Customs authorities have expressed 
the opinion that EU information sources and services are 
insufficient and don,t make their work any easier. 
 
42. The drug unit of the Czech Custom Service was not 
structurally changed by EU accession.   However, it has 
gained new responsibilities such as monitoring transports, 
imports and exports of precursors from and to third 
countries. They also will be newly responsible for monitoring 
the growth of poppy seeds and technical cannabis (contains 
less than 2% THC). 
 
43.  As part of the  European operation Seis Frontera, the 
Czech Custom Service will be given responsibility for the 
monitoring of carbonate sodium, which can be used in cocaine 
production. The Czech Republic doesn,t produce carbonate 
sodium but imports it from neighboring Slovakia. Only amounts 
over 100kg will be reported. Czech Custom Service still 
hasn,t designated their point of contact for this.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, KPAL, IZ, EZ, MEPP 
SUBJECT: CZECH MEP ON REPAIRING US-EUROPE RELATIONS 
 
 
Classified By: Political Officer Kimberly C. Krhounek for reasons 
1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  Longtime embassy contact and Member of the 
European Parliament (MEP) Jana Hybaskova termed herself 
shocked by the depth of anti-American feeling she has found 
at European institutions such as the Council and Commission, 
including knee-jerk reactions opposing any U.S. involvement 
in areas of EU concern.  She urged that the USG make 
relations with Europe a priority, \"invite\" European countries 
to participate more fully in Iraq and the MEPP, and make 
greater use of NATO as a unifying force to achieve common 
objectives.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) On January 4, we met with Czech MEP Jana Hybaskova 
during a visit home from Brussels.  A fluent Arabic and 
English speaker, Ms. Hybaskova had a 15 year career with the 
Czech MFA where she served as head of the Middle East 
Department and as Czech Ambassador to both Slovenia and 
Kuwait.  While in Kuwait, she proved to be an instrumental 
ally in getting coalition allies involved on the ground in 
Iraq.  Thanks in large part to her energy and effort, the 
Czechs had up to 16 experts working for the CPA, deployed an 
NBC unit and field hospital to Iraq, and launched 
humanitarian assistance programs which now include training 
diplomats, police and Iraqi judges.  Since being elected as 
one of the Czech Republic\'s first MEPs in June 2004, Ms. 
Hybaskova has joined the Group of European People\'s 
Party-European Democrats and chairs the Delegation for 
relations with Israel, among other committee assignments. 
Ms. Hybaskova has very strong views on the importance of the 
transatlantic relationship, and has been one of our biggest 
supporters on Middle East issues including Iraq and the MEPP. 
 
3.  (C) Hybaskova said one of the biggest shocks she received 
in Brussels was seeing the depth of anti-American sentiment 
within EU institutions.  While the European Parliament 
members are less virulent because they have such diverse 
constituency needs, she found the European Commission and 
Council to be \"really, really anti-American.\"  As one 
example, she cited the Commission\'s plan to cut a program 
from 20 million euros to 4 million euros, until someone made 
the argument that if that particular program was cut, the 
Americans would \"come in and fill the gap.\"  Immediately, the 
20 million euro allotment was restored.  She said that such a 
simple, knee jerk reaction is very common and is routinely 
used by MEPs to keep their pet projects funded. 
 
4.  (C) Hybaskova was very pleased that President Bush would 
soon be traveling to Europe and hoped the visit would be seen 
as a signal to Europeans that the USG values the 
transatlantic relationship.  She urged that the USG \"invite, 
and I mean really invite\" European countries to be more 
involved in planning and developments in Iraq and also in 
Israel and the Palestinian territories, as these were still 
the most sensitive issues in our relations.  She said that 
many Europeans are convinced that the USG only wants their 
money to fund projects, but that they are not welcome at the 
table to plan how best to implement important steps forward. 
She further urged that the USG use NATO as a primary unifying 
organization.  The NATO training mission in Iraq is a good 
example, as there is already a high degree of unity and 
consensus at NATO, so bringing it into areas where it has 
competence will make Europeans feel more involved. 
 
5.  (C) Comment.  Ms Hybaskova was clearly dismayed by the 
extent to which the dispute over Iraq had colored our 
relationship with the most important EU institutions.  Like 
many Central Europeans, she holds NATO in very high esteem, 
and believes that the USG will be able to achieve greater 
European involvement in Iraq and other areas by essentially 
\"going around the EU\" and operating through NATO\'s consensus 
mechanisms.  This is one way to avoid the politically charged 
atmosphere in Brussels.  As a long-time Arabist, Ms. 
Hybaskova will continue to play an important role in Middle 
East issues (she is currently planning to participate in EP 
election observer missions to the Palestinian Authority and 
Iraq), only now on the broader EU stage.  Given her youth 
(age 39) and energy, she can be one of those who will most 
strongly influence these issues within the EU during the 
coming years.  End comment.

FOR OIG/ISP, EUR/NCE, and EUR/EX 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ASIG, EZ, AMGT 
SUBJECT: POST RESPONSE TO OIG RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
REF: SEPTEMBER 2004 REPORT OF INSPECTION NO. ISP-I-04-39A 
 
1.  Prague submits the following responses to the formal 
recommendations of the referenced OIG report. 
 
2.  Recommendation No. 1:  Embassy Prague should request, 
and the Bureau of Consular Affairs and Bureau of European 
And Eurasian Affairs should approve and fund, an additional 
Foreign Service national position in the Consular Section to 
perform Consular management support duties.  (Action: 
Embassy Prague, in coordination with CA and EUR) 
 
Embassy\'s response:  Embassy concurs with the OIG 
recommendation and has taken action.  The FMO section has 
included the cost of an FSN-06 management support position 
in its budget forecast and will include the request in this 
year\'s MPP submission.  Embassy now awaits funding from 
Department to take further action on this recommendation. 
 
3.  Recommendation No. 2:  Embassy Prague should reissue a 
visa referral policy under Chief of Mission signature, 
consistent with the most recent guidance, and ensure that it 
is implemented consistently.  (Action:  Embassy Prague) 
 
Embassy\'s response:  Embassy reissued visa referral policy 
in Management Notice number 31/04 on 7/19/04. 
 
4.  Recommendation No. 3:  Embassy Prague should 
institutionalize the required record keeping and audit 
procedures described in the Consular Management Handbook to 
compare machine-readable visa fee collections against 
applications received.  (Action:  Embassy Prague) 
 
Embassy\'s response:  The Consular Section is now reconciling 
MRV collections with applications received, as required by 
the Consular Management Handbook. 
 
5.  Recommendation No. 4:  Embassy Prague, in coordination 
with the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, should 
formally study the feasibility of reconfiguring existing 
areas within the chancery to meet Consular space needs. 
(Action:  Embassy Prague, in coordination with OBO) 
 
Embassy\'s response:  The Embassy has been working with the 
Bureau of Consular Affairs (\"CA\") and the Bureau of Overseas 
Buildings Operations (\"OBO\") for over a year on enlarging 
the Consular Section to accommodate growth in staffing, 
increased numbers of applicants, and new legislatively- 
mandated visa requirements.  The ideal plan for the Mission 
is to construct a new facility in the third garden of the 
Mission compound.  However, neither CA nor OBO have the 
necessary funds to cover construction costs, estimated to be 
approximately USD 11 million, nor will they have those funds 
in the foreseeable future.  Therefore the Embassy has 
devised an interim plan to enlarge the Consular Section by 
expanding into adjacent areas of the Chancery currently 
occupied by other sections and remodeling other areas to 
accommodate their relocation.  While this solution is not 
ideal, we do not have the luxury of waiting many years for 
the eventual construction of a new Consular facility. 
 
We have received from CA funds in the amount of $42,000 for 
design of the expansion project and are working with a local 
architectural firm on the plans, which are currently at the 
35% completion stage.  Embassy will need additional funds 
from CA and/or OBO to cover the costs of renovation and 
relocation to implement this proposal.  We estimate the 
costs to be approximately $350,000 and have requested this 
amount from the Department. 
 
6.  Recommendation No. 5:  Embassy Prague should implement a 
more active monitoring schedule to scan all user folders for 
inappropriate material and document the review of randomly 
selected user libraries.  (Action:  Embassy Prague) 
 
Embassy\'s response:  ISO and ISSO Prague have implemented a 
bi-weekly random scan of user libraries, email, and folders. 
These reviews are documented in the ISSO Log. 
 
7.  Recommendation No. 6:  Embassy Prague should complete 
and implement the information system documentation 
requirements and provide copies of the plans to the Bureau 
of Information Resource Management.  (Action:  Embassy 
Prague) 
 
Embassy\'s response:  ISSO and Systems Managers have 
submitted the IT Contingency Plan and System Security Plan 
to DS for review. The Configuration Management Plan has an 
anticipated completion/submission date of 31 January 2004. 
 
8.  Recommendation No. 7:  Embassy Prague, in coordination 
with the Bureau of Information Resource Management, should 
work to approve an offsite alternate facility for classified 
information systems processing and storage.  (Action: 
Embassy Prague, in coordination with IRM) 
Embassy\'s response:  IRM equipment and contingency plans are 
available, but the lack of an offsite location cleared for 
the storage and processing reduces their effectiveness. Post 
IMO is currently working with IRM and DS to resolve 
this issue. DS regulations regarding offsite 
storage/processing of classified information severely reduce 
the options open to post regarding storage of contingency 
classified equipment/operations. 
 
9.  Recommendation No. 8:  Embassy Prague should discontinue 
the practice of authorizing U.S. government sponsored school 
employees to use the diplomatic pouch for personal mail 
services.  (Action:  Embassy Prague) 
 
Embassy\'s response:  Embassy is in the process of formally 
requesting a waiver from DPM in order to provide this 
service to the U.S. citizens currently working at the 
International School in Prague. 
 
10.  Recommendation No. 9:  Embassy Prague should enforce 
procedures to alert the Deputy Chief of Mission to 
delinquencies in the preparation of work requirements 
statements and/or performance evaluations by respective 
officers.  Such delinquencies should be noted in each 
respective officer\'s evaluation report.  (Action:  Embassy 
Prague) 
 
Embassy\'s response:  Embassy recognizes the importance of 
ensuring timely submission of local employee performance 
appraisals and has developed and implemented a systematic 
method to correct and prevent the problem from re-occurring. 
We now track performance appraisal due dates in our employee 
database.  During the first 5 days of every month, our HR 
clerk downloads a customized report of performance appraisal 
due dates and sends it out to all raters and reviewers, with 
a copy to the DCM.  The DCM is therefore made aware of any 
delinquencies and raters and reviewers are reminded monthly 
of upcoming due dates.  We anticipate that this new system 
will help ensure the timely submission of performance 
appraisals.

2.  (SBU)  PolCouns met with Jan Kara, Director of the Czech 
MFA\'s Department of United Nations Affairs, on January 6 to 
deliver reftel demarche regarding gaining European support 
for Community of Democracies invitations.  Overall Kara said 
the Czech Republic is flexible on the question of membership 
for the countries in question.  Specifically: 
 
-- Singapore:  Kara said that the Czech Republic 
preliminarily sees no problem with maintaining Singapore at 
their observer status. 
 
-- The Gambia:  CR agrees to maintain as an observer in light 
of their advances towards stable democracy 
 
-- Ukraine:  Kara agreed that Ukraine is \"going in a good 
direction\" and saw no reason why it should not be invited as 
a participant. 
 
-- Algeria:  This was the only country with which Kara 
expressed reservations about the U.S. position.  He stated 
that as there seems to be a general, similar level of 
democratization among North African nations, he didn\'t see 
why Algeria should be treated differently than, for example, 
Morocco and Tunisia (who are signatories to the Warsaw 
Declaration). 
 
-- Taiwan:  Kara recalled the CR\'s friendly relations with 
Taiwan and the CR\'s stated plan to support Taiwan as a 
participant.  He said that the CR\'s only worry would be the 
impact of Taiwanese participation upon potential Community of 
Democracies linkage to the United Nations, since Taiwan is 
not a UN member. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Kara made passing mention of several other 
countries, saying loosely that the CR is likely to be 
\"flexible\" about Haiti, Djibouti, Fiji, and the Solomon 
Islands.  He feels that the MFA\'s regional office may side 
with inviting Angola as an observer, but doubted this would 
be a major Czech priority.  He also stated that extending an 
invitation to Iraq would be great encouragement for them, 
provided their upcoming election goes well. 
 
4. (SBU)  Kara expressed readiness for further discussions 
regarding USG positions on positions in advance of the May 
Ministerial.

SUBJECT: CZECH POSITION ON EU CUBA POLICY 
 
REF: STATE 4900 
 
Classified By: Polec Counselor Michael Dodman for reason 1.4 b+D 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The Czech MFA appreciates reftel effort to 
remind European capitals of the real issues at stake in the 
EU debate over its common Cuba policy.  Czech efforts are 
currently focused on establishing a meaningful format for the 
structured EU dialogue with the opposition.  The Czech 
reading of internal EU debate in Havana since the partial 
unfreezing of relations is not encouraging:  COMs focused 
neither on the substance of dialogue with the opposition, nor 
the need to rebuff Castro\'s attempt to split EU member 
states.  The Czechs expect little progress at tomorrow\'s 
COLAT meeting, but promise to withhold Czech approval at the 
GAERC meeting unless the new measures have substance behind 
them.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Polec Counselor met with Czech MFA Americas Department 
Director Edita Hrda on Jan 10 to deliver reftel points in 
advance of the Jan 11 EU COLAT meeting.  Hrda welcomed the 
specific proposals in the U.S. paper and was especially in

Havana to work with the EU.  She appreciated that the U.S. 
paper was being delivered to all member states.  Hrda said 
she had low expectations for the upcoming COLAT meeting, 
which she will send her deputy to attend.  She expressed 
great frustration with both the form and substance of the 
internal EU debate, including: 
 
-- Luxembourg has limited ability to moderate the debate. 
The Presidency\'s Cuba expert is, according to Hrda, an 
officer at the Luxembourg embassy in the Hague; Luxembourg 
has no mission in Havana, so the Dutch will continue to 
represent the Presidency there, preventing the Dutch from 
taking a more forceful position in internal debates (although 
Hrda also noted in passing that the Czechs no longer consider 
the Dutch to be their \"partner\" on this issue). 
 
-- The first meeting of EU COMs in Havana took place the day 
after Castro\'s partial unfreezing of relations with EU 
missions.  Hrda termed this meeting a huge disappointment to 
the Czechs.  She summarized the readout from the Czech 
mission:  the planned agenda was completely jettisoned; the 
Spanish and most other EU members discussed their happiness 
with Castro\'s decision and steps they planned to take to 
normalize relations; the Czechs and the Poles expressed 
frustration and tried to focus COMs on the mandate (from the 
December COLAT meeting) for them to prepare a format for the 
new dialogue with dissidents; the Dutch were essentially 
silent, except to note the need to force the Cubans to 
unfreeze relations with the remaining member states and the 
Commission (a point helpfully seconded by Portugal). 
 
-- In the end the Dutch did circulate (but did not discuss) a 
draft proposal for the structured dialogue, which Hrda 
dismissed as a non-starter.  The Dutch proposal calls for 
quarterly meetings with COMs from the EU Troika, does not 
specify the topics to be discussed nor call for a 
sufficiently broad participation from dissidents.  Hrda 
stated clearly that the Czech government will not authorize 
FM Svoboda to support the December COLAT conclusions at the 
late-January GAERC meeting unless the Czechs are satisfied 
that the new measures are at least as significant as the 
previous EU common position. 
 
3. (C) In terms of next steps, the Czechs have prepared their 
own draft proposal for the structured dialogue.  It calls for: 
 
-- all EU COMs meeting four to six times per year with a 
group of five to six opposition leaders (to be selected in 
consultation with dissident groups), at EU embassies or 
residences, with an agenda covering \"political orientation of 
different groups; long-term vision of their role in the 
transformation; presentation of their opinions on substantial 
issues of Cuban political development and points of view on 
cooperation with the EU at the present stage, during the 
transformation process and after the transition to democracy.\" 
 
-- monthly meetings of all EU mission political counselors 
with a rotating group of up to ten opposition leaders or 
relatives of political prisoners, at EU embassies on a 
rotating basis, covering \"political orientation of different 
groups and their activities; information on development in 
regions; detailed information on persecution by government 
bodies; information on the health conditions of political 
prisoners, development of their lawsuits in the period before 
judgment.\" 
 
The GOCR intends to share this proposal with what Hrda termed 
the Czechs\' \"partners\" -- specifically the Poles (whom Hrda 
singled out as having been increasingly supportive of the 
Czech position), Slovaks, Slovenians, and Germans.  Hrda 
promised to study reftel points to determine which could be 
incorporated into the Czech draft. 
4. (C) In response to Polec Counselor\'s question, Hrda said 
the MFA is united in its approach to the EU\'s Cuba policy. 
She noted that there had been some concerns from her 
colleagues who manage EU affairs on a daily basis that a 
Czech position in opposition to that of many larger members 
states could hurt Czech interests (she noted specifically 
threats Czech diplomats claim to have received from the 
Spanish that the CR would \"pay a price\" for its position) but 
said that all the important players on the question (she 
listed FM Svoboda, DFM Kolar, MFA Political Director 
Schneider and MFA DG for Bilateral Relations Bombasova) were 
in favor of the principled approach Hrda continues to 
recommend.

SUBJECT: THE MOUSE THAT ROARED: CZECH EFFORTS IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST 
 
 
Classified By: Political Officer, Kimberly C. Krhounek, 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
 1.  (C) Summary.  During a January 10 lunch discussion, MFA 
Director of Middle East Affairs Ivo Silhavy discussed the 
Czech role in the Middle East Peace Process and upcoming 
elections in Iraq.  The Czechs see the Middle East as an area 
where they can play a role as an honest broker, making use of 
its good relations with Israel, Palestinian leaders and 
neighboring Arab states, as well as capitalizing on its 
\"neutral\" status as a small country with no ulterior motives 
in the region.  The Czech Republic will also serve this year 
as the NATO Contact Embassy for Israel.  Silhavy also 
discussed strong GOCR interest in sending observers to 
monitor Iraqi elections later this month, and the MFA\'s 
efforts to keep its Iraqi development budget from being 
raided by those seeking to boost Czech assistance to victims 
of the South Asia tsunamis.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) Silhavy said that the Czechs were very pleased with 
the January 9 elections in the Palestinian Authority, noting 
that they appeared to be largely free and fair.  This gives 
Mahmoud Abbas a fairly broad mandate to represent the 
Palestinian people in re-starting the peace process.  He 
noted that both sides seemed ready to come back to the 
negotiating table -- something that has often been missing 
historically.  The GOCR has made assisting the Middle East 
Peace Process a foreign policy priority and they are 
committed to seeing the roadmap implemented.  Silhavy said 
that the Czech Republic enjoys a reputation in the region as 
being \"neither pro-Israeli, nor pro-Palestinian\" and that it 
enjoys good relations with neighboring Arab countries as 
well.  FM Svoboda completed a trip to the Middle East in 
December 2004, where he visited a number of Arab states and 
in Israel met with the PM, FM and the Israeli Knesset, as 
well as with Palestinian leaders.  This year, the Czech 
Embassy will serve as the NATO Contact embassy for Israel. 
Silhavy stated that one advantage of the Czech Republic is 
that, due to it\'s being a small country rather than a 
superpower or major foreign policy player, it can bring ideas 
and encouragement to the table without anyone suspecting them 
of having another \"agenda\" where affecting the outcome could 
be put to their benefit. 
 
3.  (C)  Silhavy was also very interested in this month\'s 
elections in Iraq.  He said the MFA had identified a small 
number of people (probably 2-5) who are willing to go to Iraq 
to serve as election observers.  The GOCR is now waiting for 
further word from the Coalition authorities as to how 
security will be managed, in order to complete planning for 
their participation.  The Czechs met with a group of 25 
countries in Ottawa that is considering basing election 
observers out of Amman, Jordan, but they are also reviewing 
other possible missions where they can contribute.  The 
missing details about security will determine the final 
outcome; they want to know how the coalition plans to 
guarantee security for voters and observers on election day. 
Silhavy is also occupied with guarding his Iraqi assistance 
and development budget (approximately $1.4 million in 
transformation and cooperation funds), following the proposal 
by Minister of Industry and Trade Milan Urban to raid some of 
the Iraq budget to boost Czech assistance to the 
tsunami-stricken areas of South Asia.  Silhavy said that a 
 
SIPDIS 
final decision on this should take place on January 19 and 
that he was hopeful that his budget would remain intact. 
After all, he noted wryly, \"there is always money\" if the 
government decides it is a priority. 
 
4.  (C) The conversation also briefly touched on the issue of 
democracy in the Middle East and whether the Palestinian 
elections would spur additional democratization initiatives 
in the region.  Silhavy said that if Iraq can get the 
security situation under control, it will be the major test 
case for implementing democracy in the Middle East, which is 
now being \"exported\" there, rather than arising domestically. 
 
 
5.  (C) Comment.  Silhavy, like the two preceding MFA Middle 
East Department Directors, is a strong supporter of USG 
policies in the region.  Outside of Europe, promoting 
democratic change in both the Middle East and Cuba are two of 
the GOCR\'s most significant foreign policy goals.  Despite 
(or perhaps because of) the lack of a visible connection in 
both places, the Czechs have the ability to play a unique 
role in supporting USG initiatives there.  In both the Middle 
East and Cuba, the Czech Republic has shown the willingness 
to take a stand within the EU to push for policy initiatives, 
it has a wealth of experience in transitioning to democratic 
institutions and a market economy to share, and it believes 
that as a small country with no ulterior motives, it can play 
a significant role as \"honest broker.\"  The Czechs want a 
strong partnership with the U.S. in these areas.  If ket 
informed on USG policy initiatives, they will often be 
natural allies in helping shape the EU positions on issues 
when we seek European backing.  End comment.

SUBJECT: DSACEUR LETTER ON NTM PAVES WAY FOR CZECH 
GOVERNMENT TO SEEK  PARLIAMENTARY MANDATE FOR CONTINUED 
CZECH DEPLOYMENT IN SOUTHERN IRAQ 
 
Classified By: Deputy Political Counselor Mark Canning for reasons 1.4 
(B/D) 
 
1. (C) According to President Klaus\' office, the Czech 
government in its weekly 
cabinet session on January 12 decided to seek a parliamentary 
mandate for the 
continued deployment of the Czech company of MPs in southern 
Iraq.  The MOD 
was charged with preparing the draft for presentation to 
parliament, perhaps 
as early as the week of January 17 in a special parliamentary 
session.  The mandate 
will provide for the Czech unit to continue under MNF for 
now, but switch over 
to NTM when NTM Phase III starts later in the year.  We 
understand that the mandate 
is to provide for deployment until the end of February 2006. 
A DSACEUR letter 
that same day to FM Svoboda and MOD Kuehnl contained explicit 
assurances that the 
Czech contingent would be included under NTM when Phase III 
begins later this year, 
according to an informed Czech diplomat and the British 
Embassy, citing MOD 
sources. 
 
2. (C) MFA Deputy Director for Security Policy, Vaclav Balek, 
also told Poloff 
on January 12 that DSACEUR\'s letter, which Balek had read, 
indicated that the 
Czech military police now conducting training in Basra as 
part of the MNF, 
could continue the same mission in the same place as part of 
NATO\'s training 
mission in Iraq, once Phase III begins later this year.  Even 
though no specific 
date was given for the start of Phase III, the signal was 
sufficient for PM Gross\' 
Government to take a decision to seek parliament\'s approval 
for a mandate 
extension. 
 
3. (C) Balek said that the government will argue that 
participation in the 
NATO mission is an important long-term national goal and that 
a temporary 
extension of the mission under MFN should not prevent them 
from achieving their 
goal.  The government will also argue that it will cost much 
more to 
temporarily close the mission in Basra and fly everyone home, 
only to fly them 
back some months later and reopen the mission.  Balek was 
optimistic that the 
extension would be passed under these conditions. 
 
4. (C) Comment:  The current mandate expires on February 28. 
Although there will 
be criticism from left-wing CSSD deputies that the Czech unit 
was not included 
from the start under NTM, which has UNSCR authorization, the 
prospects for 
parliamentary approval now look better than ever.

SUBJECT:  CZECH REPUBLIC: 2005 INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 250356 
 
1.  Post\'s updated investment climate statement for 2005 
follows para 2. 
 
2. THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE 
 
Maintaining an open investment climate has been a key 
element of the Czech Republic\'s transition from a Communist, 
centrally planned economy to a functioning market economy. 
The Czech Republic\'s stable political and economic 
environment, its location on the doorstep of the European 
Union, its low cost structure and its well-qualified labor 
force make it an attractive destination for foreign 
investment.  Prior to its accession to the European Union on 
May 1, 2004, the Czech government harmonized its laws and 
regulations with those of the European Union. The Czech 
economy has experienced moderate growth in the past few 
years.  A rising government budget deficit could put 
continued growth at risk in the medium to long term, 
particularly if the current strong direct foreign investment 
flows slow down and European demand remains weak.  The Czech 
government offers attractive incentives for foreign direct 
investment.  Legally, foreign and domestic investors are 
treated equally.  Enforcement of intellectual property 
rights is improving.  According to U.S. Embassy 
calculations, the U.S. is currently the third largest 
investor in the Czech Republic, behind Germany and the 
Netherlands. 
 
Openness to Foreign Investment 
 
For several years, the Czech Republic has received more 
foreign direct investment (FDI) per capita than any other 
country of the former Soviet bloc. Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) has been growing recently (2.9% in 2003, and an 
estimated 3-4% in 2004), based largely on significant 
inflows of foreign investment and growing consumer demand 
supported in part by rising wages influenced by that 
investment.  Foreign investment is boosting productivity, 
creating new jobs and raising wages and domestic 
consumption.  It is also contributing to a trend of 
appreciation in the value of the Czech currency, the crown. 
This phenomenon is helping to keep inflation low (0.1% in 
2003, about 3.5% in 2004), but somewhat reduces the 
competitiveness of Czech exports.  Some unfinished elements 
in the transition, such as slow and uneven enforcement of 
contracts by the Czech courts, have adversely affected 
investment, competitiveness, and company restructuring. 
 
There have been numerous major U.S.  investments since 1990, 
and many American firms are looking closely at investing 
directly into the Czech Republic.  The government has 
harmonized most relevant laws with EU legislation and the so- 
called \"acquis communautaire\".  This effort has involved 
positive reforms of the judicial system, civil 
administration, financial markets regulation, intellectual 
property rights protection, and many other areas important 
to investors.  While there have been many success stories, a 
handful of investors have experienced problems, mainly in 
heavily regulated sectors of the economy such as the media 
and in enterprises where the state is a partner.  Investors 
also complain about difficulties in enforcing contractual 
rights, including security interests.  The slow pace of the 
court system is often compounded by judges\' lack of 
familiarity with commercial cases.  Needed reforms of the 
system for registering companies and the bankruptcy laws 
have been slow in coming.  Concerns about corruption have 
been voiced by foreign and domestic businesses alike. 
 
Organizational Structure of Investments 
 
Foreign investors can, as individuals or business entities, 
establish sole proprietorships, joint ventures, and branch 
offices in the Czech Republic.  In addition, the government 
recognizes joint-stock companies, limited liability 
companies, general commercial partnerships, limited 
commercial partnerships, partnerships limited by shares, and 
associations.  The government imposes a Czech language 
requirement for issuance of the trade licenses needed for 
most forms of business.  The requirement has been waived for 
citizens of EU countries, and under the terms of the U.S.- 
Czech bilateral investment treaty should be waived for U.S. 
citizens as well. 
 
National Treatment 
 
Legally, foreign and domestic investors are treated 
identically.  Both are subject to the same tax codes and 
laws.  The government does not differentiate between foreign 
investors from different countries, and does not screen 
foreign investment projects other than in the banking, 
insurance and defense sectors.  Upon accession to the OECD, 
the Czech government agreed to meet (with a small number of 
exceptions) the OECD standards for equal treatment of 
foreign and domestic investors and limitations on special 
investment incentives.  The U.S.-Czech Bilateral Investment 
Treaty contains specific guarantees of National Treatment 
and Most Favored Nation treatment for U.S. investors in all 
areas of the economy other than insurance and real estate. 
(See the section on the Bilateral Investment Treaty below) 
 
Exempted Sectors 
 
According to CzechInvest, the Czech agency tasked with 
attracting and facilitating FDI, all sectors of the Czech 
economy are open to foreign investment.  Investors in 
banking, financial services, insurance and broadcast media 
sectors must meet certain licensing requirements.  Some 
professions, such as architects, physicians, lawyers and tax 
advisors, require memberships in the appropriate 
professional chamber.  These licensing and membership 
requirements apply equally to foreign and domestic 
investors. 
 
Privatization 
 
More than eighty percent of the Czech economy is now in 
private hands after several waves of privatization of 
formerly state-owned companies since 1989.  Privatization 
programs have been open to foreign investors.  In fact, most 
major state-owned companies have been privatized with 
foreign participation.  The government evaluates all 
investment offers for state enterprises.  Non-transparent 
and unfair practices have been alleged in connection with 
some recent privatizations. 
 
Conversion and Transfer Policies 
 
The Czech crown is fully convertible for business purposes, 
including all trade transactions and investment transactions 
with one limitation: non-resident foreign individuals and 
companies without registered offices in the Czech Republic 
cannot purchase real estate.  Imports or exports of more 
than 350,000 Czech crowns in cash, travelers\' checks or 
money orders must be declared at the border. 
 
The U.S.-Czech Bilateral Investment Treaty guarantees 
repatriation of earnings from U.S. investments.  A 15% 
withholding tax is charged on repatriation of profits from 
the Czech Republic.  This tax is reduced under the terms of 
applicable double taxation treaties.  For instance, under 
the U.S. treaty, the rate is 5% if the U.S. qualifying 
shareholder is a company controlling more than 10% of the 
Czech entity, and 15% otherwise.  There are no 
administrative obstacles for removing capital.  The law 
permits convertibility into any currency.  The average delay 
for remitting investment returns meets the international 
standard of three working days. 
 
Expropriation and Compensation 
 
The Embassy is unaware of any expropriation of foreign 
investment since 1989.  Acquisition of property by the 
government is now only for public purposes (similar to 
property condemnation in the United States for public works 
projects) in a non-discriminatory manner, and in full 
compliance with international law.  It is unlikely that any 
investor losing property due to a governmental taking would 
not receive full compensation. 
 
Another issue of concern to foreign investors in the Czech 
Republic is restitution.  In 1990 and 1991, the federal 
government of Czechoslovakia enacted various laws aimed at 
compensating those people whose property was confiscated by 
the communist regime during the period of 1948-1989.  Under 
the restitution laws, persons have the right to claim 
compensation for property taken from them by the communist 
government.  Most claims for restitution of non-agricultural 
property had to be filed by October 31, 1991, and 
agricultural property by December 1992.  There were 
additional open seasons for claims in 1994 and 1998 
respectively but all deadlines for these claims expired on 
July 8, 1999.  In 2000, however, a new Law to Alleviate Some 
of the Property Damages Caused by the Holocaust entered into 
force.  It amends the restitution laws allowing the state, 
subject to certain conditions, to return communal Jewish 
property, works of art and land illegally seized by the 
Nazis to entitled Jewish communities and individuals. 
 
Although deadlines for submitting restitution claims are now 
past, it is nevertheless important that foreigners seeking 
to invest in the Czech Republic first ensure that they have 
clear title to all land and property associated with 
potential projects.  The process of tracing the history of 
property and land acquisition can be complex and time- 
consuming, but it is necessary to ensure clear title.  Title 
insurance is not yet offered in the Czech Republic. 
Investors participating in privatization of state-owned 
companies are protected from restitution claims through a 
binding contract signed with the government. 
 
Dispute Settlement 
 
The Czech Republic has a commercial code and a civil code 
that are largely based on the German legal system.  The 
commercial code details rules pertaining to legal entities 
and is analogous to corporate law in the United States.  The 
civil code deals primarily with contractual relationships 
among parties.  When the Czech Republic was formed in 1993, 
the new Czech government maintained the previous commercial 
and civil codes.  The laws have been extensively amended 
since then, but gray areas still remain.  The judiciary is 
independent, but decisions may vary from court to court. 
Commercial disputes, particularly those related to 
bankruptcy proceedings, can drag on for years.  Companies 
registration is in the hands of the courts and is sometimes 
slow and overly complicated. 
 
The need for an improved bankruptcy law remains an important 
structural impediment. Most observers believe the slow and 
uneven performance of the courts and weakness of creditors\' 
legal standing is an impediment to increased lending to 
small and medium enterprises.  The law also lacks provisions 
for corporate restructuring.  The Ministry of Justice has 
identified bankruptcy reform as a priority and appointed a 
commission to draft a completely new, effective bankruptcy 
law.  Progress has been slow and competing versions of the 
law are now under consideration. 
 
The Czech Republic ratified the Convention on the Settlement 
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other 
States in 1993. The U.S.-Czech Bilateral Investment Treaty 
provides for international arbitration of investment 
disputes with the state. The Czech Republic has also 
ratified the New York Convention on the Recognition and 
Enforcement of Arbitral Awards. As a signatory of the latter 
convention, it is required to uphold binding arbitration 
awards in disputes between Czech and foreign parties. 
However, arbitration of disputes between two Czech 
corporations outside the Czech Republic is not permitted, 
even if the owners are foreign. Applications for enforcement 
of foreign judgments can be made to the Czech courts and 
will be determined in accordance with a bilateral 
recognition treaty, if any, or otherwise pursuant to the 
requirements of Czech law. Judgments rendered in other EU 
countries are enforceable in accordance with applicable EU 
regulations. 
 
Investment Incentives 
 
In 1998 the Czech government approved a package of 
incentives to attract investment. The incentives are offered 
to foreign and domestic firms that make a $10 million 
manufacturing investment through a newly registered company. 
The package includes relief from corporate taxes for up to 
ten years, job-creation grants, re-training grants and 
opportunities to obtain low-cost land. A tax incentive is 
also available for expansion of an existing manufacturing 
investment. Subsidies are offered for services centers for 
software development, customer service and repairs. More 
recently, subsidies to attract high technology and research 
and development centers have been added. Tax deductions for 
new machinery, real estate tax relief, job creation grants, 
re-training grants, simplified customs procedures and duty- 
free import of machinery are also available under certain 
conditions to qualified companies. The incentives were 
developed with the assistance of the EU in order to ensure 
their compatibility with EU rules on industrial subsidies. 
Therefore, there has been no change to the incentive program 
as a result of the Czech Republic\'s accession to the 
European Union. 
 
The Czech Republic is in compliance with WTO TRIMs 
requirements. There are currently no general performance 
requirements imposed on foreign firms for establishing, 
maintaining, or expanding their investments, except in 
connection with the incentives described above. These 
performance requirements generally relate to the amount of 
investment or hiring of employees if special job-creation 
grants are received with the incentive package. For more 
information contact CzechInvest, Director Mr. Radomil Novak, 
phone: 420-296 342 501, fax: 420-296 342 502, address: 
Stepanska 15, 120 00 Praha 2, Czech Republic, 
marketing@czechinvest.org, www.czechinvest.org. Special 
performance requirements are negotiable. 
 
Foreign workers in the Czech Republic must obtain permits 
and visas in advance of their taking up employment and 
residence.  The process of obtaining the required permits 
can be time-consuming. 
 
Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
 
The right of foreign and domestic private entities to 
establish and own business enterprises is guaranteed by law 
in the Czech Republic. Enterprises are permitted to engage 
in any legal activity with the previously noted limitations 
in some sensitive sectors. Personal ownership of real estate 
by non-resident foreign individuals is not permitted, but 
since January 1, 2002, foreign companies registered to do 
business in the Czech Republic and Czech branches of foreign 
entities may own real estate, other than agricultural and 
forest land. Since May 1, 2004, EU, U.S. and some other 
nationals can purchase real property if they comply with 
temporary residence requirements.  Czech legal entities, 
including 100% foreign-owned subsidiaries, may own real 
estate without any limitations. 
 
Protection of Property Rights 
 
Existing legislation guarantees protection of all forms of 
property rights, both intellectual and physical. Secured 
interests in land (mortgages) and in personal property are 
permitted. Government subsidy programs are making mortgage 
financing more accessible, and consumers are becoming more 
used to using both secured and unsecured forms of credit. 
According to U.S. lawyers in the Czech Republic, enforcing 
judgments and foreclosing security interests in land and 
personal property can still be difficult in practice. 
 
Major amendments to the Commercial Code came into force in 
2001 that strengthen protection of creditors and minority 
shareholders. The law includes detailed provisions for 
mergers and places time limits on decisions by the 
authorities on registering of companies. New laws on 
auditing and on accounting were also enacted. These laws 
include the use of international accounting standards (IAS) 
for consolidated corporate groups. 
 
The Czech Republic is a signatory to the Bern, Paris, and 
Universal Copyright Conventions. In 2001, the government 
ratified the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Treaty on 
Performances and Phonograms. Domestic legislation protects 
all intellectual property rights, including patents, 
copyrights, trademarks, and semiconductor chip layout 
design. Amendments to the trademark law and the copyright 
law have brought Czech law into compliance with relevant EU 
directives and WTO TRIPs requirements. Changes to the civil 
procedure code, effective January 1, 2001, provide for ex 
parte search and seizure in enforcement actions. The Czech 
Republic increased copyright protection for literary works 
from 50 to 70 years, effective December 1, 2000, and boosted 
the powers of the customs service and the Czech Commercial 
Inspection to seize counterfeit goods. The Embassy continues 
to work with U.S. industry and Czech government officials to 
further improve enforcement of intellectual property rights. 
 
Transparency of the Regulatory System 
 
Tax, labor, environment, health and safety, and other laws 
generally do not distort or impede investment. Policy 
frameworks are consistent with a market economy. All laws 
and regulations are published before they enter into force. 
Opportunities for prior consultation on pending regulations 
exist, and all interested parties, including foreign 
entities, can participate. A biannual governmental plan of 
legislative and non-legislative work is available on the 
Internet, along with information on draft laws and 
regulations (often only in Czech language). Comments can be 
and are made by business associations, consumer groups and 
other non-governmental organizations, including the American 
Chamber of Commerce. 
However, bureaucracy and unnecessary red tape remain a 
source of complaints by both domestic and foreign investors. 
Delays and allegations of corruption are common, especially 
in the process of registering companies and changes to 
corporate structure, and are of particular concern to 
foreign companies operating in the Czech Republic. 
 
In content and principle, Czech competition policy meets 
OECD standards. A new Act on the Protection of Economic 
Competition entered into force in 2001, adopting rules 
consistent with EU competition policy as regards restrictive 
agreements, abuse of dominant position and merger control. 
 
Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investments 
 
The government privatized the last state-owned bank in 2001 
and foreign-controlled banks now manage 90% of total banking 
assets. The banking sector has recovered from the 1998-99 
recession, the poor payment discipline of many of the banks\' 
clients, and non-competitive loans offered in the early 
1990s. Stricter oversight by the central bank has been 
imposed. Commercial banks have returned to profitability 
after posting losses in 1999. As of April 1, 2004, the total 
assets of commercial banks stood at $14.1 billion. As of the 
same date, non-performing loans amounted to 11.2% of total 
credit volume, compared to 28.8% in 2000. This figure does 
not include non-performing loans (with a face value of $5.5 
billion as of March 31, 2003) transferred to the Czech 
Consolidation Agency, which is charged with liquidating 
them. Foreign investors have access to bank credit on the 
local market, and credit is generally allocated on market 
terms. In 2002, the banks for the first time established a 
mechanism for sharing credit histories of borrowers. 
 
The Czech securities market is still handicapped by a poor 
reputation generated by several years of lax regulation, 
fraud and scandals. Market capitalization of equities traded 
on the Prague Stock Exchange was 27.0% of GDP in 2003. Only 
a handful of stocks are actively traded.  The first 
successful initial public offering of a company\'s shares 
since the stock market opened in 1992 took place in 2004. In 
1998 the government created a Securities and Exchange 
Commission to function as capital market watchdog. The 
Commission has made important strides in establishing a 
regulatory framework for Czech capital markets and enforcing 
new rules. It has employed a large number of new staff. A 
new securities law was adopted in 2001 to improve regulation 
of brokers and dealers. Legislation adopted in 2002 gives 
the SEC more flexibility in issuing guidelines and requiring 
reporting of information. 
 
Political Violence 
 
The risk of political violence in the Czech Republic is 
extremely low. The Czech lands have never had a history of 
political violence or terrorism in modern times. Two recent 
historic political changes -- the \"Velvet Revolution\" which 
ended the Communist era in 1989 and the division of 
Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993 
-- occurred without loss of life or significant violence. 
 
Corruption 
 
Current law makes both giving and receiving bribes criminal 
acts, regardless of the actor\'s nationality. Jail sentences 
have been increased to up to eight years for officials, with 
stiffer penalties for bribery previously enacted by 
Parliament. Bribes cannot be deducted from taxes. Law 
enforcement authorities are responsible for combating 
corruption. These laws are applied equally to Czech and 
foreign investors. The Czech Republic ratified the OECD anti- 
bribery convention in January 2000. 
 
While there has been no lack of public accusations and 
suspicions of bribery, only a few cases have reached the 
prosecution and conviction stage. Allegations of corruption 
are most pervasive in connection with the court-controlled 
system of company registration and the police. Such 
allegations have also been raised in the course of recent 
privatizations and government procurements. A new government 
procurement law, required for EU accession, is intended to 
curb illegal activities in this sphere. The Transparency 
International chapter in the Czech Republic actively 
conducts public information campaigns through distribution 
of posters and has given numerous broadcast and print media 
interviews on corruption and bribery cases.  In 2004, the 
government proposed legislative changes and other actions to 
reduce corruption in public life. 
 
Bilateral Investment Agreements 
The former government of Czechoslovakia signed a bilateral 
investment treaty (BIT) with the United States, which came 
into effect in 1992. The Czech Republic adopted this treaty 
after the split with Slovakia. Changes to the treaty were 
agreed with the Czech Republic after extensive negotiations 
with the EU Commission and the Czech government during 2003. 
The amendments were narrowly tailored to meet EU concerns 
about perceived conflicts with the EU acquis communautaire. 
Subsequently, the Czech government is seeking further 
changes to the treaty that would affect its coverage and 
dispute settlement provisions.  To date, 70 countries have 
signed and ratified similar agreements with the Czech 
Republic. They include: Australia, Austria, Belgium- 
Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, 
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Indonesia, Italy, 
Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, North and South Korea, 
Mongolia, Norway, Paraguay, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, South 
Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the United 
Kingdom. Agreements with other countries are in the process 
of ratification. A bilateral U.S.-Czech Convention on 
Avoidance of Double Taxation has been in force since 1993. 
 
OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs 
 
Finance programs of the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation (OPIC), including investment insurance, have 
been available in the Czech Republic since 1991. Investors 
are urged to contact OPIC\'s offices in Washington directly 
for up-to-date information regarding availability of 
services and eligibility. The OPIC InfoLine (202) 336-8799 
offers general information 24 hours a day. Application forms 
and detailed information may be obtained from OPIC, 1100 New 
York Avenue, NW, Washington D.C. 20527. The Czech Republic 
is a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA). 
 
Labor 
 
The wide availability of educated, low-cost labor on the 
doorstep of the more expensive Western European labor market 
is a major attraction for foreign investors, particularly 
those looking to invest in manufacturing industries. Wages 
and benefits are on the rise, but the Czech Republic will 
still have far lower labor costs in the year 2004 than those 
in Western Europe. There are currently no significant 
shortages of specialized labor skills, though foreign 
investors still cite weaknesses in middle-management levels. 
Various factors, including rigidities in the housing market, 
reduce the mobility of Czech workers within the country. 
 
By law, all workers have the right to strike once mediation 
efforts have been exhausted, with the exception of workers 
in sensitive positions (nuclear power plant operators, 
military, police, etc.) Significant labor unrest remains 
rare, particularly in the private sector. Public sector 
unions, notably the rail workers and health workers, have 
staged strikes when the government tried to limit public 
sector wage increases. Increased labor activity has been 
noted in mining and steel industries due to current economic 
problems. Workers in the Czech Republic have the legal right 
to form and join unions of their own choosing without prior 
authorization. Currently, about one-third of the total labor 
force is a member of some labor organization. The overall 
number of union members has fallen sharply since 1991, 
reflecting the fact that union membership is no longer 
compulsory. 
 
The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs sets minimum wage 
standards. On January 1, 2001, a new labor code entered into 
force, harmonizing domestic rules with the EU. The standard 
workweek is 40 hours. Caps exist for overtime. Workers are 
assured 30 minutes of paid rest per work day and annual 
leave of at least four weeks per year. 
 
Foreign-Trade Zones and Free Ports 
 
Czech law permits foreign investors involved in joint 
ventures to take advantage of commercial or industrial 
customs-free zones into which goods may be imported and 
later exported without depositing customs duty. Duties need 
be paid only in the event that the goods brought into the 
free zone are introduced into the local economy. The 
investment incentive package also permits duty-free import 
of high tech goods and creation of additional foreign-trade 
zones. 
 
Currently authorized foreign trade zones in the Czech 
Republic are Cheb, Ostrava, Pardubice, Prague (2), Zlin, 
Trinec, Bor u Tachova, Frantiskov nad Ploucnici and Hradec 
Kralove. Rules for operations within a commercial or 
industrial customs-free zone are the same as in the EU. 
 
Foreign Direct Investment Statistics 
 
According to data compiled by the Czech National Bank and 
the U.S. Embassy, the stock of foreign investment in CR 
(including reinvestment of profits) totaled $41.1 billion in 
1993-2003 (56.4% of 2002 GDP). Germany and the Netherlands 
are officially the leading foreign investors. Their 
investments totaled $11.3 billion (31%) and $9.6 billion 
(26.0%) respectively, followed by the United States and 
Austria with $3.6 billion (10.1%) each, France with $2.2 
billion (6%), UK with $1.9 billion (5.2%). Other major 
investors include Belgium, Switzerland and Slovakia. In 2002 
inward flows of FDI reached $9.3 billion (13.3% of GDP and 
the second largest inflow per capita in Central and Eastern 
Europe, after Slovenia; as for FDI stock per capita, the 
Czech Republic is number one among these countries). The 
upswing in investment since 1998 is generally attributed to 
the introduction of investment incentives, as well as the 
Czech Republic\'s natural advantages. 
 
By sector, from 1993-2003 foreign direct investment flowed 
into manufacturing ($11.9 billion or 32.6%), financial 
services ($5.8 billion or 16%); trade, hotels and 
restaurants ($4.8 billion or 13.1%); transportation and 
telecommunications ($7.3 billion or 20%); real estate and 
business activities ($3.6 billion or 9.8%); and electricity, 
gas and water supply ($2.0 billion or 5.4%). Other sectors 
attracting foreign investment included mining and 
construction. Government officials anticipate the steady 
inflow of investment to continue, augmented among others by 
the eventual sale of the government shares in companies like 
the electrical utility CEZ and the telecom company Cesky 
Telecom. 
 
The stock of Czech direct investment abroad totaled $1.4 
billion as of December 2002. The flow of Czech investment 
abroad was $276 million in 2002, with principal destinations 
of Slovakia (40%), followed by Slovenia (26%), British 
Virgin Islands (11.0%), and the U.S. (4.6%).
