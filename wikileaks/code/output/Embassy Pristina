SUBJECT: THACI SCENESETTER: LEADER LOOKING FOR APPROVAL 
 
1. (U)   CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN K. MENZIES, COM, FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B&D) 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (C) DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF KOSOVO (PDK) PRESIDENT HASHIM 
THACI IS CONCERNED THAT WASHINGTON IS NEITHER MUCH INTERESTED 
IN NOR FRIENDLY TOWARDS HIM, AND WILL SEEK DEMONSTRATIONS OF 
APPROVAL, LARGELY TO BOLSTER HIS IMAGE IN KOSOVO, BUT ALSO 
BECAUSE HE WANTS THE RECOGNITION.  HIS POLITICAL STRENGTH IN 
KOSOVO A BIT RAGGED, THACI MAY BE MORE OPEN TO ENCOURAGEMENT 
TO BE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE, PARTICULARLY IN REACHING OUT TO 
KOSOVO SERBS.  IN HIS MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, WE SHOULD ALSO 
PUSH HIM TO DO HIS PART BEFORE AND AFTER THE NOVEMBER 
ELECTIONS TO CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY IN KOSOVO.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
POLITICIAN IN SEARCH OF... 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) AS PDK PRESIDENT THACI LEAVES KOSOVO FOR THE U.S. 
SEPTEMBER 11, HE IS A POLITICIAN WHOSE RHYTHM HAS BEEN BROKEN 
BOTH BY HIS COMPATRIOTS\' PREFERENCE FOR MOVING PAST THE WAR 
AND FOR POLITICAL MODERATION, AND BY AN ACUTE AWARENESS OF 
POLITICAL CHANGES IN WASHINGTON.  NEVER ONE TO LOOK TO OTHER 
EUROPEAN CAPITALS, THACI NOW FEARS THAT HIS STOCK HAS FALLEN 
IN U.S. POLICY CIRCLES.  A MAJOR REASON FOR HIS TRIP, HE HAS 
IMPLIED, IS TO GAUGE JUST HOW DEEP THE DISENCHANTMENT WITH 
HIM GOES THERE. 
 
 
...APPROVAL 
----------- 
 
4.  (C) SOMEWHAT COUNTER-INTUITIVELY PERHAPS, IT IS THACI WHO 
HAS MOST RELIED ON A PRESUMED \"ALLIANCE\" WITH THE U.S. TO 
BOLSTER HIS POLITICAL FORTUNES.  HIS POLITICAL FORTUNES IN 
KOSOVO HAVE SAGGED.  DEMOCRATIC LEAGUE OF KOSOVO (LDK) 
PRESIDENT RUGOVA HAS SOME 12 YEARS OF POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT 
AND LEADERSHIP IN KOSOVO, AS WELL AS STILL VERY STRONG 
POPULAR SENTIMENT IN HIS FAVOR.  THACI WILL ALWAYS FALL SHORT 
OF RUGOVA,S STATURE AS A FATHER FIGURE FOR THE K-ALBANIANS. 
AT A PRISTINA CULTURAL EVENT SEPTEMBER 8, RUGOVA APPEARED 
RELAXED AND CONNECTED WELL WITH THE AUDIENCE.  IN CONTRAST, 
THACI FELL FLAT IN HIS SPEECH. 
 
5.  (C) ALLIANCE FOR THE FUTURE OF KOSOVO (AAK) PRESIDENT 
RAMUSH HARADINAJ CAN POINT TO HIS OWN WAR RECORD WHEN HE 
NEEDS TO, BUT HAS NOT SAT ON HIS LAURELS, INSTEAD 
ENERGETICALLY PURSUING A RANGE OF POLITICAL ALLIANCES AND 
BROADENING THE APPEAL OF HIS COALITION.  SPECULATION IS RIFE 
THAT THE AAK WILL SURPASS THE PDK ON NOVEMBER 17 AND BECOME 
KOSOVO,S SECOND POLITICAL FORCE AND REAL OPPOSITION.  AS THE 
BRITISH COM PUT IT RECENTLY, THACI COULD BECOME \"YESTERDAY,S 
MAN\" IN KOSOVO. 
 
6.  (C) BOTH RUGOVA AND HARADINAJ ARE EAGER TO COOPERATE AND 
MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., OF COURSE, BUT NEITHER 
NEEDS US IN THE WAY THACI, WHO REMAINS PERSONALLY VESTED IN 
HAVING \"LIBERATED\" KOSOVO, SEEMS TO DO.  HE WILL BE ANXIOUS, 
AS THE CAMPAIGN SEASON STARTS IN KOSOVO, TO PORTRAY HIMSELF 
AS PLUGGED INTO THE USG IN WASHINGTON AND UN IN NEW YORK.  HE 
WILL SEEK A PUBLIC POLITICAL EMBRACE FROM U.S. OFFICIALS. 
 
 
...SUPPORT 
---------- 
 
7.  (C) THACI AND OTHER PDK LEADERS HAVE NOT DONE MUCH EITHER 
TO REDEFINE THEMSELVES IDEOLOGICALLY OR TO RE-ENERGIZE THE 
PARTY ORGANIZATION FOLLOWING THEIR DISAPPOINTING, BUT NOT 
WHOLLY UNEXPECTED, SHOWING LAST OCTOBER.  RUMORS OF 
INFIGHTING HAVE INCREASED DURING THE YEAR (ALTHOUGH THACI WAS 
ABLE IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY TO DISAPPEAR TO THE U.S. FOR 6 
WEEKS WITHOUT APPARENT CONCERN OVER A COUP D\'ETAT).  MORE 
THAN ONCE, THE PRESS STATEMENTS AND PUBLIC POSITIONS OF PDK 
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN AT VARIANCE, HIGHLIGHTING SHAKY CENTRAL 
CONTROL.  MOREOVER, THE PDK HAS SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN AND MEDIA 
SAVVY HIGH OFFICERS, MORE THAN ONE OF WHOM MAY SEEK AN EVEN 
HIGHER PROFILE IN THE PARTY.  ANOTHER DISAPPOINTING SHOWING 
IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS COULD SHARPEN THE INTERNAL 
CHALLENGE TO THACI. 
 
 
...ENCOURAGEMENT TO DO RIGHT 
---------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) DESPITE HIS POLITICAL WOES, HOWEVER, THACI IS SHOWING 
SOME OPENNESS TO POSITIVE STEPS ON THE KOSOVO SCENE.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, IN A RECENT DISCUSSION WITH THE COM, HE AGREED TO 
MEET WITH THE K-SERB LEADER MOMCILO TRAJKOVIC, PROVIDED USOP 
ASSISTED IN FACILITATING AND PROVIDING A VENUE.  THE KOSOVAR 
PRESS IS REPORTING ON THE INVITATION OF SERBIAN PM DJINDJIC 
FOR THACI TO VISIT BELGRADE.  EARLIER THIS SUMMER, WHEN 
DJINDJIC SUGGESTED ORALLY THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO MET WITH BOTH 
THACI AND KOSOVO PROTECTION CORPS (KPC) COMMANDER AGIM CEKU, 
THACI EXPRESSED SOME WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER A MEETING ON 
NEUTRAL GROUND.  WE DO NOT KNOW IF HE WILL GO TO BELGRADE (HE 
MAY SUSPECT A POLITICAL OR JUDICIAL TRAP), BUT HE HAS 
ACKNOWLEDGED RECEIVING THE SERBIAN PM\'S LATEST, AND MORE 
OFFICIAL, INVITATION. 
 
9.  (C) INTERESTINGLY, THOSE WHO ATTEND MEETINGS OF THE 
INTERIM ADVISORY COUNCIL (IAC) KNOW THAT IN PRIVATE, THACI IS 
COMFORTABLE AND GETS ALONG WELL WITH SERB OBSERVER RADA 
TRAJKOVIC, JOKING WITH HER EVEN IN SERBIAN.  PRECISELY 
BECAUSE OF HIS KLA LEADERSHIP DURING THE WAR, THACI IS 
POLITICALLY SAFER IN REACHING OUT TO KOSOVO SERBS THAN IS 
RUGOVA.  THE LATTER WAS MORE THAN ONCE PORTRAYED AS \"SOFT ON 
SERBIA\", AND FINDS THIS HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL 
VULNERABILITY.  THACI CANNOT BE ACCUSED OF COMPLICITY.  WE 
BELIEVE THAT HE RECOGNIZES THIS AND MAY SEEK TO USE DEALINGS 
WITH THE SERBS TO RAISE HIS PROFILE -- AND GAIN OUR APPROVAL. 
 WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE HIM TO UNDERTAKE CONSTRUCTIVE MOVES IN 
THIS DIRECTION, SINCE THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH HE AND HIS 
FOLLOWERS CAN DO A LOT TO IMPROVE THE CLIMATE FOR 
RECONCILIATION AND RETURNS. 
 
10.  (C) IN THE REGIONAL CONTEXT, AS EVENTS IN THE FYROM 
DEGENERATED DURING THE SPRING, THACI TOOK THE MOST 
CONSTRUCTIVE PUBLIC LINE FOR SOME TIME (WHATEVER HE OR HIS 
COHORTS MAY HAVE DONE LESS PUBLICLY), OFFERING POLITICAL 
SUPPORT TO HIS OLD MENTOR ARBEN XHAFERI, PRESIDENT OF THE 
ALBANIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDSH) IN FYROM AND MOST PROMINENT 
OF THE ALBANIANS IN PARTICIPATING IN GOVERNMENT THERE.  THACI 
MAINTAINED THIS SUPPORT DESPITE CRITICISM FROM WITHIN HIS OWN 
PARTY AS TO HIS LOYALTY TO THE ALBANIAN CAUSE. 
 
 
...A FUTURE 
----------- 
 
11.  (C) THACI TOLD THE COM RECENTLY THAT VIOLENCE HAS 
TAPERED OFF IN KOSOVO.  THERE ARE STILL OCCASIONAL REPORTS OF 
ATTACKS OR INSTANCES OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST LDK ACTIVISTS IN 
PARTICULAR, HOWEVER, AND THACI KNOWS WELL THAT PDK IS ALWAYS 
THE FIRST SUSPECT.  IN OUR PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS,  THACI IS 
ALREADY WARNING OF LDK POLITICAL DOMINANCE, WHICH HE FEARS 
WILL BECOME \"ONE-PARTY RULE.\"  USG OFFICIALS MAY WISH TO 
ENCOURAGE HIM TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUED REDUCTION OF VIOLENCE, 
TO BEHAVE CONSTRUCTIVELY DURING THE CAMPAIGN, AND TO DO HIS 
PART, NO MATTER WHAT THE ELECTORAL OUTCOME, TO CONSOLIDATE 
DEMOCRACY IN KOSOVO. 
 
12.  (U) BELGRADE MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, KDEM, NATO, YI 
SUBJECT: AAK ADAMANT ON INDEPENDENCE DECLARATION 
 
CLASSIFIED BY COM RENO HARNISH; REASON 1.5 B/D. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  IN A FEBRUARY 6 MEETING MARKED BY FRANK 
EXCHANGES, COM TOLD AAK PRESIDENT HARADINAJ THAT HIS PARTY\'S 
DRAFT DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WAS AN UNWELCOME AND 
POTENTIALLY DESTABILIZING DIVERSION THAT LEAVES THE REAL 
BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT SADLY NEGLECTED.  COM ASKED HARADINAJ 
TO CONSIDER WITHDRAWING IT FROM THE ASSEMBLY AGENDA. 
HARADINAJ ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE DECLARATION HAS NO CHANCE OF 
ENACTMENT THIS YEAR BUT INSISTED ITS PRESENT VALUE WOULD BE 
IN FRAMING A DEBATE THAT WOULD REACH FRUITION IN FUTURE 
YEARS.  HE AGREED THAT KOSOVO\'S GOVERNMENT HAD TO DO A BETTER 
JOB AND CONFIDED THAT, TO THIS END, ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT DACI 
IS WORKING WITH BRITISH INTERMEDIARIES TO ARRANGE A MEETING 
IN SWITZERLAND WITH PARLIAMENTARIANS FROM SERBIA TO DISCUSS 
PRAGMATIC ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) COM, DPO, AND ECON-POL CHIEF MET ON FEBRUARY 6 WITH 
ALLIANCE FOR THE FUTURE OF KOSOVO (AAK) PRESIDENT RAMUSH 
HARADINAJ TO URGE RECONSIDERATION OF HIS PARTY\'S DRAFT 
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE (ENGLISH TRANSLATION FORWARDED 
PREVIOUSLY).  COM TOLD HARADINAJ THE USG CONSIDERS BOTH THE 
AAK DRAFT AND SERBIAN PM DJINDJIC\'S CALL FOR FINAL STATUS 
NEGOTIATIONS TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE \"MANUFACTURED CRISES\" 
THAT ARE PARTICULARLY UNWELCOME IN WASHINGTON AT THIS TIME 
WHEN USG\'S FOCUS IS OUT OF EUROPE.  COM SAID NEITHER 
INITIATIVE HAS ANY PROSPECT WHATSOEVER OF GAINING USG 
SUPPORT.  THE MISGUIDED EFFORTS, HE ADDED, STOOD TO BENEFIT 
ONLY EXTREMIST ENEMIES OF PEACE IN KOSOVO WHO WOULD DELIGHT 
IN WATCHING DISCORD GROW BETWEEN KOSOVO\'S ALBANIAN AND SERB 
COMMUNITIES.  FINALLY, COM URGED HARADINAJ TO CONSIDER THAT 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S SERIOUS SUPPORT FOR KOSOVO WAS 
NOT BEING MATCHED BY SIMILARLY SERIOUS EFFORT ON THE PART OF 
THE KOSOVARS WHO HEAD THE PROVISIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF 
SELF-GOVERNMENT (PISG).  HE SAID THE KOSOVO ASSEMBLY IN 
PARTICULAR, WITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS, HAD SHOWN LITTLE 
INTEREST AND LESS EXPERTISE IN THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT AND 
URGED HARADINAJ AND COLLEAGUES TO GET ABOUT THE ESSENTIAL IF 
MUNDANE GROUNDWORK NECESSARY TO PRIVATIZATION AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN GRANDSTANDING ON INDEPENDENCE. 
 
3. (C) HARADINAJ REPLIED IN SIMILAR CIVIL YET FRANK TONES. 
TAKING AS HIS POINT OF DEPARTURE THE RECENT SERBIA-MONTENEGRO 
PREAMBLE REFERENCE TO KOSOVO AS PART OF SERBIA, HE SAID \"A 
SIMILAR THING HAPPENED IN 1974 WHEN THE FRY CONSTITUTION 
REFERRED TO KOSOVO AS PART BOTH OF YUGOSLAVIA AND SERBIA.\" 
THEN, AS NOW, HE SAID THE KOSOVARS WERE TOLD THAT THE 
REFERENCE WAS MEANINGLESS BUT KOSOVO THEN SPENT DECADES 
TRYING TO GET OUT OF THOSE BOXES.  THE IC, HE SAID, DID NOT 
GO TO BELGRADE ON THE SERBIA-MONTENEGRO CHARTER AS IT IS NOW 
COMING TO PRISTINA TO SAY, \"THIS IS DESTABILIZING; DON\'T DO 
THIS.\"  HE AGREED THE PISG MUST DO A BETTER JOB AND OFFERED 
TO REDOUBLE EFFORTS BUT DID NOT SEE PRAGMATIC GOVERNANCE AS 
INCONSISTENT WITH A DEBATE ON INDEPENDENCE.  HE VOLUNTEERED 
THAT KOSOVO WOULD NOT ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE THIS YEAR BUT 
INSISTED THAT MOVING THE DISCUSSION IN THIS DIRECTION IS A 
SIGN THAT A \"MATURING\" AAK IS READY TO \"TELL OUR FRIENDS NOT 
JUST WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.\"  HE SUGGESTED THAT THE USG 
SHOULD JUST ALLOW THE DECLARATION DEBATE TO UNFOLD SO AS NOT 
TO BE DISTRACTED FROM PRESSING CONCERNS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE 
WORLD.  COM ASSURED HIM THE USG WOULD CONTINUE TO DEVOTE 
ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO KOSOVO AND WOULD NOT STAND BY AND ALLOW 
PRISTINA-BELGRADE TENSIONS TO MOUNT OVER MANUFACTURED CRISES. 
 
PRISTINA-BELGRADE ASSEMBLY INITIATIVE 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) IN REACTION TO COM RECURRING SUGGESTION THAT THE PISG 
SHOULD FOCUS ON GOVERNANCE OVER INDEPENDENCE, HARADINAJ 
CONFIDED THAT (ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT NEXHAT) DACI ON FEBRUARY 5 
TOLD HIM HE WAS WORKING WITH BRITISH INTERMEDIARIES ON A PLAN 
FOR THE PARLIAMENTS OF KOSOVO AND SERBIA TO BEGIN 
CONSIDERATION OF TECHNICAL ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN.  DACI 
AND A KOSOVO ASSEMBLY DELEGATION ARE MAKING PLANS TO TRAVEL 
TO SWITZERLAND FOR NGO-SPONSORED MEETINGS.  THE PLAN CALLS 
FOR A DELEGATION FROM THE SERBIAN PARLIAMENT TO TRAVEL TO 
SWITZERLAND AT THE SAME TIME ON UNRELATED BUSINESS AND FOR 
DACI AND HIS SERBIAN COUNTERPART TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
TRIPS TO MEET AND PAVE THE WAY FOR MORE FORMAL PARLIAMENTARY 
CONTACT TO FOCUS ON TECHNICAL TOPICS SELECTED FOR LACK OF 
POLITICAL OVERTONE.
