SUBJECT: CHAD: 1987 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 42378 
 
1.  CHAD DOES NOT ENGAGE IN OR SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  RATHER, THIS COUNTRY HAS LONG BEEN THE TARGET 
OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT OR SPONSORED BY LIBYA, 
WHOSE ULTIMATE GOAL IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HABRE REGIME 
AND THE EXPANSION OF LIBYAN HEGEMONY SOUTHWARD. 
 
2.  LIBYAN TERRORISM HAS BEEN LARGELY INEFFECTIVE OVER 
THE PAST YEAR DUE TO A COMBINATION OF ITS OWN INCOMPE- 
TENCE, THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES OF ACCESS TO THIS 
ISOLATED LAND, AND (MOST IMPORTANT), THE TIRELESS EFFORTS 
OF THE CHADIAN SECURITY SERVICES, WHICH FOILED SEVERAL 
ATTEMPTS TO SMUGGLE ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES INTO THE COUNTRY. 
 
3.  DURING 1987, ONLY TWO ATTEMPTS AT TERRORISM WERE IN 
ANY WAY SUCCESSFUL IN CHAD.  IN MARCH 1987, A LIBYAN- 
SPONSORED TERRORIST ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY A BRIDGE CONNECT- 
ING NDJAMENA TO KOUSSERI IN CAMEROUN.  THE TERRORIST DID 
SUCCEED IN BLOWING HIMSELF UP, BUT ONLY DAMAGED THE 
BRIDGE, WHICH WAS BACK IN LIMITED OPERATION WITHIN HOURS. 
IN OCTOBER 1987, A BUILDING BELONGING TO AN AMERICAN 
PRIVATE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION IN THE PROVINCIAL TOWN OF 
MOUNDOU WAS DAMAGED BY AN EXPLOSION FOR WHICH LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE LIBYAN-INSPIRED TERRORISTS WERE 
RESPONSIBLE.

REF: (A) NDJAMENA 795, (B) NDJAMENA 800 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
- 
2. SUMMARY:  QADHAFI WARNED DEBY DURING LATTER\'S RECENT 
VISIT TO LIBYA THAT THERE COULD BE NO STABILITY IN CHAD 
IF BILATERAL RELATIONS DID NOT REMAIN POSITIVE. 
BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH FRANCE ARE GOOD AND DEBY IS 
INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE ON 
DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUES, ACCORDING TO DEPARTING 
FRENCH AMBASSADOR.  END SUMMARY. 
- 
3.  ALONG WITH MANY OTHER WELL-WISHERS, I WAS AT 
N\'DJAMENA AIRPORT AT NOON TODAY, FEBRUARY 26, TO SAY 
FAREWELL TO DEPARTING FRENCH AMBASSADOR GENDREAU.  HE 
PULLED ME ASIDE TO NOTE POINTS MADE BY PRESIDENT DEBY 
IN THEIR FINAL MEETING EARLIER THE SAME MORNING. 
ACCORDING TO GENDREAU, AT THEIR MEETING IN BENGHAZI 
LAST WEEK, QADHAFI ESSENTIALLY THREATENED DEBY WITH 
DESTABILIZATION IF CHAD DID NOT MAINTAIN FRIENDLY 
RELATIONS WITH LIBYA.  QADHAFI REFERRED TO THE 
INGRATITUDE OF EARLIER CHADIAN LEADERS AND NOT SO 
SUBTLY INDICATED TO DEBY THAT HE COULD MAKE TROUBLE IF 
DEBY FOLLOWED SUIT.  GENDREAU SAID THAT DEBY RESENTED 
THIS LANGUAGE AND REMAINS ON GUARD TOWARDS QADHAFI AND 
LIBYA. 
- 
4.  GENDREAU ALSO COMMENTED ON CHAD-FRANCE RELATIONS 
WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS GOOD, AND HE ADDED THAT LOCAL 
FRENCH BUSINESSMEN, ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER MERCHANTS, 
SAY THEY NOTE AN IMPROVED ATTITUDE OF CHADIAN 
AUTHORITIES TOWARD THEM.  IN RESPONSE TO MY COMMENT 
REGARDING DEBY\'S NEED TO DEAL WITH EMERGING DOMESTIC 
POLITICAL PROBLEMS, GENDREAU SAID THAT THE CHADIAN 
PRESIDENT IS INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE NEED FOR 
FLEXIBILITY IN THIS AREA. 
- 
5.  COMMENT:  THIS WAS A HURRIED CONVERSATION THAT DID 
NOT ALLOW TIME TO EXPLORE THE POINTS MADE BY GENDREAU. 
AS INDICATED REF (A), THE CHADIANS WHO ACCOMPANIED DEBY 
TO BENGHAZI WITH WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN HAVE INDICATED 
THAT DEBY\'S SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS WERE ONLY PARTLY 
SUCCESSFUL.  IT IS NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER GENDREAU 
WAS REFERRING TO QADHAFI\'S MENACING SPEECH OR REMARKS 
MADE PRIVATELY TO DEBY.  IN ANY CASE, GENDREAU\'S REPORT 
SUGGESTS THAT DEBY AND QADHAFI DID NOT ESTABLISH A GOOD 
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.  WE ARE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED BY 
GENDREAU\'S COMMENTS ON THE MOOD OF FRENCH BUSINESSMEN 
HERE SINCE BUSINESS ACTIVITY IS AT A STANDSTILL. 
HOWEVER, THE FRENCH GENERALLY PROBABLY FEEL LESS 
HOSTILITY FROM THE GOC THAN WHEN HABRE WAS IN POWER. 
ON DOMESTIC ISSUES, IT MAY BE THAT BY NOW DEBY IS 
RESPONDING TO INTENSIFYING PRESSURE FROM SOUTHERNERS 
AND OTHERS TO KEEP HIS PROMISES REGARDING 
DEMOCRATIZATION, BUT SO FAR THERE IS LITTLE TANGIBLE 
PROOF OF SUCH AN ATTITUDE REPORTED BACK TO US BY OTHER 
SOURCES, OTHER THAN DEBY\'S OWN INNER CIRCLE.  (REF B).

2.  SUMMARY:  SENIOR GOC OFFICIALS HAVE STRESSED TO ME 
THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. AND OTHERS IN OUR EFFORTS TO 
COUNTER LIBYAN TERRORISM, AND THEY HAVE PROVIDED 
ASSURANCES THAT THEY WILL RESIST LIBYAN EFFORTS TO 
NEUTRALIZE WESTERN INFLUENCE IN THIS REGARD.  FOREIGN 
MINISTER AHMAT BRIEFED ME ON THE PRIME MINISTER\'S 
RECENT VISITS TO NIGER, NIGERIA, CAMEROON AND LIBYA. 
HE SAID THAT THE GOC WILL SOON SEND DELEGATIONS TO 
KHARTOUM AND BANGUI AS WELL.  WHILE GENERALLY PLEASED 
WITH THE SUPPORT OF CHAD\'S NEIGHBORS, THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER HAD A REALISTIC SENSE OF WHAT IS AND WHAT IS 
NOT POSSIBLE.  IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT, THE GOC SEEMS 
MORE CONCERNED THAN USUAL TO MAINTAIN THE SUPPORT OF 
THE USG, AND IT RECOGNIZES THAT WILL REQUIRE 
CONSIDERABLE CARE IN DEALING WITH LIBYA.  END SUMMARY.

-------------------------------- 
FOLLOW-UP TO PAN AM/UTA DEMARCHE 
-------------------------------- 
- 
3.  FOLLOWING LAST FRIDAY\'S PAN AM 103/UTA 772 DEMARCHE 
(REF A), PRESIDENT DEBY SUMMONED ME ON SATURDAY.  HE 
ASSURED ME THAT CHAD SUPPORTED OUR POSITION REGARDING 
LIBYAN TERRORISM.  HE NOTED CHAD\'S OWN LOSSES ON THE 
UTA 772 FLIGHT AS WELL AS ITS OTHER CONCERNS REGARDING 
LIBYA.  HE ALSO SAID THAT SENIOR LIBYAN OFFICIALS HAD 
PHONED HIM SEEKING HIS SUPPORT.  HE CLAIMED TO HAVE 
REJECTED THEIR ENTREATIES.   HE SAID HE GAVE PRECISE 
INSTRUCTIONS TO PRIME MINISTER ALINGUE NOT TO FALL INTO 
ANY LIBYAN TRAPS REGARDING THE PAN AM/UTA ISSUE. 
- 
4.  ON MONDAY, JANUARY 20 FOREIGN MINISTER MAHAMAT 
SALEH AHMAT, WHO ACCOMPANIED ALINGUE ON HIS RECENT 
TRIPS TO NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, REITERATED THE POINTS 
MADE BY DEBY.  HE SHOWED ME THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE SIGNED 
IN TRIPOLI THE DAY BEFORE.  HE DREW MY ATTENTION TO THE 
UNEQUIVOCAL CONDEMNATION OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN 
ALL ITS FORMS, NOTING THE INNOCENT LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN 
LOST.  THE TEXT APPEARED TO BE STRENGTHENED BY THE 
CHADIANS, AND IT NOTED THAT EACH SIDE EXPLAINED ITS 
RESPECTIVE POSITION.   THE LIBYANS DID MANAGE TO GET 
THE CHADIANS TO AGREE TO LANGUAGE NOTING THE THREATS 
AND INTIMIDATION WEIGHING ON THE LIBYAN PEOPLE.  CHAD 
MADE SUPPORTIVE STATEMENTS TO THE LIBYAN PEOPLE WHO 
FACED THREATS OF DESTABILIZATION TO THE SUB-REGION. 
- 
------------------ 
ALINGUE\'S MEETINGS 
------------------ 
- 
5.  ON ALINGUE\'S MEETINGS IN NEIGHBORING CAPITALS, 
AHMAT SAID THAT AT EACH STOP, INCLUDING TRIPOLI, THE 
RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS OFFERED TO SUPPORT THE GOC.  IN 
NIGER HE SAID THE GON WAS UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORTIVE 
BUT EXTREMELY LIMITED IN TERMS OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY 
COULD DO GIVEN DIFFICULT DOMESTIC PRIORITIES AND 
LIMITED FUNDS.  HE SAID THAT THE BULK OF THE REFUGEES 
WOULD BE MOVED TO DIFFA FROM N\'GUIGMI AND SOME OF THE 
LEADERS WOULD BE PLACED IN DOSSO.  HE SAID THE 
NIGERIANS AGREED TO OPEN THE BORDER WHICH IS IMPORTANT 
TO PEOPLE WHO TRADE ACROSS THE FRONTIER.   AHMAT NOTED 
THAT THE REBELS DID NOT OBSERVE THE CLOSED BORDER IN 
ANY CASE, SO THERE WAS NOTHING GAINED BY KEEPING IT 
CLOSED.  HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT ABUJA WOULD ACT BUT 
SKEPTICAL THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD OVERCOME 
THE EFFECT OF SUPPORT THE REBELS ARE ABLE TO GARNER IN 
BORNU.  AHMAT SEEMED GENERALLY SATISFIED WITH THE 
MEASURES BEING TAKEN BY THE CAMEROONIANS.  WHEN I ASKED 
WHETHER HE FELT THAT THE GOC HAD LIBYAN SUPPORT, HE 
REPLIED, QUOTE WELL, THAT IS WHAT THEY SAY.  UNQUOTE. 
- 
6.  AHMAT SAID THAT PRIME MINISTER ALINGUE INTENDS TO 
LEAD DELEGATIONS SOON TO CAR AND SUDAN, AND HE SAID 
THAT THE GOC IS BEING ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH THE 
SENEGALESE IN DAKAR.  HE SAID THAT THE MEETINGS IN 
NIGER, NIGERIA AND CAMEROON ENTAILED FAIRLY SPECIFIC 
NEGOTIATIONS WHILE THOSE IN OTHER CAPITALS WERE MORE IN 
THE NATURE OF BRIEFINGS TO SENSITIZE CHAD\'S NEIGHBORS 
TO THE IMPORTANCE N\'DJAMENA ATTACHES TO THE REBEL 
THREAT.  TALKS IN DAKAR WOULD BE AIMED AT PRESSING THE 
GOS TO EXERT GREATER CONTROL OVER HABRE.  AHMAT CLAIMED 
THAT REBEL LEADER GOUKOUNI GUET HAS RETURNED TO 
SENEGAL, PRESUMABLY TO PLAN NEXT MOVES WITH HABRE. 
- 
----------------------------------- 
CHADIAN PERCEPTION OF THE U.S. ROLE 
----------------------------------- 
- 
7.  THE CHADIANS SEEM TO HAVE LINKED SEVERAL RECENT 
DEVELOPMENTS.  THE REBEL ATTACKS AND THE WAVE OF 
ARRESTS THAT FOLLOWED, HAVE SHAKEN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN 
THE DEBY REGIME, AND IN THIS CONTEXT OUR VOLUNTARY 
DEPARTURE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS SEEN AS A FURTHER BLOW.  IN 
THE MEANTIME, OUR DEMARCHES (AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE 
FRENCH) BOTH ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND LIBYA APPEAR TO 
HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON DEBY.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT MANY IF 
NOT ALL OF THOSE ARRESTED WILL SOON BE TRIED OR 
RELEASED AND THAT DEBY\'S PRO-LIBYAN CHIEF OF STAFF 
HASSAN FADOUL KITIR IS TO BE FIRED.  THE STATEMENTS BY 
DEBY AND AHMAT WERE MEANT TO ASSURE US THAT THE GOC, IN 
PART TO PRESERVE U.S. SUPPORT, IS CONDUCTING ITS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH LIBYA WITH GREAT CARE.  FROM DEBY\'S 
PERSPECTIVE, IN THE AFTERMATH OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS 
MONTH, IT IS CRUCIAL TO HAVE U.S. SUPPORT BECAUSE OF 
THE LEGITIMACY IT BESTOWS ON HIM. 
- 
8.  AT THIS POINT, WE WANT TO WAIT TO SEE IF INDEED THE 
ACTIONS NOTED IN PARA 8 WILL BE TAKEN, AND IF THEY ARE 
WHAT REACTIONS WILL FOLLOW.  WE ANTICIPATE MAKING 
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THAT TIME.

REF:  NDJAMENA 402 AND PREVIOUS (ALL NOTAL) 
 
CLASSIFIED BY D. HALSTED. REASON 1.5 (B,D). 
 
1.  (U) PRESIDENT DEBY BROUGHT BACK FROM HIS FEBRUARY 3- 
5 VISIT NEWS OF THE FORMATION OF THE COMMUNITY OF SAHEL- 
SAHARA STATES (COMMUNAUTE DES ETATS SAHELO-SAHARIENS, OR 
CESS).  CESS, ACCORDING TO DEBY\'S ANNOUNCEMENT, WOULD 
APPEAR TO BE FIVE STATES: LIBYA, CHAD, NIGER, MALI, AND 
SUDAN.  THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, BURKINA FASO, 
TUNISIA AND EGYPT WERE OTHERS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN 
REPRESENTED AT THE TRIPOLI MEETING, AND MAY ALSO BE PART 
OF THE NEW ORGANIZATION. 
 
2.  (U) DEBY SAID THE IDEA DATED BACK TO 1972.  CESS 
WOULD BE FIRST AN ECONOMIC GROUPING, THEN LATER A 
POLITICAL ASSOCIATION, GIVING A GROUP OF LANDLOCKED 
STATES OCEAN FRONTAGE.  UNITY THEMES FIGURED IN HIS 
DESCRIPTION: \"AT A TIME WHEN IMPORTANT GROUPS ARE BEING 
FORMED IN EUROPE AND ASIA, WE HAVE A DUTY, AS AFRICANS, 
TO DEVELOP THE REALITY OF TOTAL AFRICAN INTEGRATION.\" 
CESS IS TO FOCUS ON ECONOMIC COOPERATION IN AGRICULTURE, 
INDUSTRY, ENERGY, COMMERCE AND FINANCE.  PROVISIONAL 
HEADQUARTERS WILL BE IN TRIPOLI, WITH LIBYAN MAHDI 
AZHARI AS EXECEUTIVE SECRETARY AND CHADIAN ADOUM TOGOI 
AS HIS DEPUTY.  QADHAFI WAS NAMED PROVISIONAL PRESIDENT 
OF CESS. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT.  CESS IS NOT LIKELY TO AMOUNT TO MUCH, 
AT LEAST WHERE CHAD IS CONCERNED.  IT MAY PROMPT SOME 
DEBATE AS ANY AGREEMENT WILL PROBABLY BE REVIEWED BY THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  CHAD WOULD GO TO CONSIDERABLE 
LENGTHS TO ACCOMODATE QADHAFI, WHO IS GENERALLY REGARDED 
WITHIN CHAD\'S RULING GROUP AS A MENACE.  UNDER BETTER 
CONDITIONS, CHAD WOULD HAVE A GENUINE INTEREST IN A 
ROUTE TO THE MEDITERRANEAN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENT 
TRANSPORTATION ARRANGEMENTS. 
 
4.  (C) THE ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT ADOUM TOGOI SOLVES ANY 
MYSTERY OF WHERE HE WENT AFTER HIS NAME SURFACED AS A 
COUP PLOTTER AGAINST DEBY.  ALREADY A LEGEND FOR HIS 
PRO-LIBYAN SYMPATHIES, TOGOI LOST HIS JOB AS CHAD\'S 
AMBASSADOR TO LIBYA WHEN HE GOT INTO A FIST FIGHT IN 
NOVEMBER 1996 YEAR WITH THEN-FOREIGN MINISTER KEBZABO 
OVER DIFFERENCES ABOUT LIBYAN POLICY, ALL RIGHT IN FRONT 
OF A VISITING LIBYAN DELEGATION.  DEBY GAVE HIM A JOB AT 
THE PRESIDENCY SO HE COULD KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.  TOGOI 
WAS REMOVED FROM THAT JOB LAST NOVEMBER, AND THERE 
ENSUED - FOR THIS REASON AND EVIDENTLY OTHERS - THE 
CHALLENGE TO DEBY\'S LEADERSHIP FROM FELLOW ZAGHAWAS 
(REFTELS).

OF SUDAN REFUGEES IN EASTERN CHAD 
 
REF: A. A) 04 STATE 207288 
 
     B. B) 04 NDJAMENA 0957 
 
1. This is an action cable.  Please see para 8. 
 
2. Disaster Determination.  Under Section 062, Volume 2 of 
the Foreign Affairs Manual, I hereby determine that the 
Republic of Chad is suffering from a disaster which exceeds 
the host country\'s ability to provide an adequate response, 
that the host country has specifically requested donor 
support and has demonstrated its willingness to accept USG 
assistance, and that it is in the interest of the USG to 
respond. 
 
3. Background.  Since April 2003, more than 200,000 Sudanese 
from the western Darfur region have fled their villages and 
sought refuge in eastern Chad.  A massive assistance program 
coordinated by the UNHCR has been organized, resulting in the 
successful relocation of refugees to ten refugee camps 
established at least 50 km from the border, and one transit 
camp.  The U.S. is the lead donor in a multidonor effort, 
having provided a total of $75.6 million during FY 2004-05. 
Camp conditions are not yet uniformly meeting international 
minimum standards for caloric intake, potable water, 
immunization and number of children per teacher, but the 
situation has steadily improved.  Following a five-month 
blanket supplementary feeding program for children under five 
and pregnant/lactating mothers, global malnutrition rates 
dropped from 35.6 percent (CDC) in June to 17.4% 
(MSF/Holland) at the end of December. The availability of 
water has been a major obstacle to the sustainability of camp 
operations and continues to pose serious problems which may 
result in relocation of some refugees to new camps further 
inland where water availability is less problematic. 
 
4.  Despite recognition on the part of the host country, 
donors and the NGO community as early as December 2003 that 
the impact of successive waves of refugees from the Darfur 
would be deleterious to Chad\'s rural populations in the 
border area, little has been done to offset the negative 
effects resulting from increased demand placed on a fragile 
environment and on a resilient, but resource-strapped 
population. The Embassy therefore issued a disaster 
declaration in June 2004 (Ref B) which focused on water 
shortages faced by the local population, with the objective 
of increasing both the quantity and the quality of potable 
water.  The cabled funding request for installation of thirty 
wells was put on hold pending a formal assessment of the 
water/sanitation situation by an OFDA consultant; the cabled 
funding request to improve water quality by providing water 
purification kits and hand soap through UNICEF was approved. 
Despite completion of the water/san assessment in August, 
funding for the wells was not forthcoming; conversely, for 
the sanitation component, UNICEF completed procurement of the 
water purification kits/hand soap and supervised their 
distribution to the local population through NGO camp 
managers.  Meanwhile, the U.N. system has become increasingly 
attuned to the need for assisting host country populations 
and has developed and included 63 project summaries which 
have been incorporated into its 2005 Consolidated Appeal to 
the donor community.  In addition, the World Food Program 
conducted November 17-26, 2004 a rapid food needs assessment 
of host populations in the east, resulting in a series of 
recommendations to include targeted free distribution to the 
most vulnerable groups, school feeding, a program to assist 
with seed distribution, and a set of Food for Work activities 
all focusing on the local population. 
 
5.  Objectives: 
 
a) The current disaster declaration is to draw attention to 
the dramatic situation faced by Chad\'s rural populations in 
the refugee-affected border region and to initiate an 
immediate relief program which will be implemented in the 
form of Food for Work activities in collaboration with the 
non-governmental organization, ACTED, and with the World Food 
Program (WFP) which will provide the food rations.  The 
Ambassador\'s disaster authority of $50,000 will be used to 
 
 
provide ancillary inputs to Food for Work activities 
undertken by the local population, with supervision from 
ACTED, in the Bahai region where the Oure Cassonitransit 
camp has been located.  Funding not to ecee $50,000 will be 
granted to ACTED by the Embssy for the procurement of tools, 
supplies and lmited technical assistance required to 
implement  set of Food for Work activiies recommended by 
WFP.  Typical projects would include environmental protection 
(creation of tree nurseries and outplanting), construction of 
water retention infrastructure (check dams and ponds), rural 
road and airstrip repair, and well digging.  An ACTED 
technician is currently in the east attempting to define in 
more detail the FFW activities (locales, numbers of 
participants, costs).  The grant agreement will include a 
site listing of the activities to be undertaken and a line 
item budget. 
 
b) It is envisaged that additional relief activities will be 
submitted by the NGO community directly to OFDA also 
benefiting the local population.  This will be separate from 
the Ambassador\'s disaster authority of $50,000. 
 
6. Target Population.  There are an estimated 722,247 
Chadians living in the six departments where Sudanese 
refugees have been relocated: 
 
Department     Chadian      Region      Sudanese camps 
               Population 
 
Ennedi est         28,247   B.E.T       Oure Cassoni 
Kobe               44,681   Wadi Fira   Iridimi/Touloum/Am 
Nabak 
Dar Tama           73,625   Wadi Fira   Kounoungo/Mile 
Ouaddai           233,931   Ouaddai 
Assongha          160,007   Ouaddai 
Farchana/Bredjing/Treguine 
Sila              181,756   Ouaddai     Goz Amer/Djabal 
 
Total             722,247 
 
The proposed free distribution recommended by WFP for the 
local population in these departments will target 117,200 
persons.  In addition, an estimated 32,000 Chadian children 
will be fed in the school feeding program. The FFW planning 
document included in the rapid food needs assessment projects 
3,600 participating households (approx. 18,000 persons).  WFP 
anticipates collaboration on FFW activities with several 
NGOs, including ACTED for the northern Ennedi Est (Bahai) 
department. 
 
7.  GOC Request for Assistance.  An appeal for disaster 
assistance following a massive refugee influx from Darfur was 
first transmitted by the Government of Chad to the diplomatic 
corps February 6, 2004.  In the appeal, reference is made to 
the negative effect of refugees on the local population. 
Since then, there have been numerous demarches made on behalf 
of the GOC to the Embassy and other donors for the provision 
of relief for local populations.  Chad\'s President declared 
to a visiting CODEL December 10 that the economic and 
environmental toll being taken as a result of the refugee 
crisis was \"catastrophic,\" urging that action be taken to 
redress current imbalances. Similar messages have been 
conveyed by Chadian authorities to Embassy personnel on a 
regular basis for more than a year.  When the PRM/DAS visited 
the border area in January 2004, local authorities were 
already drawing attention to the negative impact of refugees 
and the need to provide assistance to host populations. The 
drafting of a U.N. Consolidated Appeal for FY 2005 is in 
recognition of this. 
 
8. Action requested.  Embassy requests a fund cite for 
$50,000 which will be granted to ACTED for the organization 
and supervision of FFW activities implemented by the Chadian 
population in refugee-impacted zones.  Upon receipt of the 
fund cite, Embassy will draft and sign the grant instrument, 
after which the obligating document will be sent to 
USAID/OFDA for recording. 
 
 
9. Please advise.

 1.  (C) Summary.  The Sixth Session of the Joint Commission 
on the Darfur Humanitarian Cease-fire (JC) was unable to 
break through the impasse over the Government of Sudan\'s 
(GOS) offensive operations in December.  The mediation team 
and international community failed to persuade the movements 
to re-engage in the process.  The movements insist that the 
GOS withdraw to its pre-December 8 positions and were angry 
over reports of the GOS attack at Mellit on January 3.  They 
rejected the Chairman\'s conclusions, walking out before they 
were read.  The AU and JC expects to hold a meeting with the 
parties sometime over the next two weeks, perhaps in Addis 
Ababa.  Finally, we suspect that the French Ambassador in 
Chad is using his position representing the European Union 
(EU) to advance the interests of the Chadian Government and 
the National Movement for Reform and Development (NMRD).  End 
Summary.

2. (U) General Mahamat Ali Abdullah chaired the sixth session 
of the Joint Commission on the Darfur Humanitarian Cease-fire 
which was held from January 3 to 4 in N\'Djamena.  Charge 
d\'Affairs Casebeer, P/E Officer, and DATT represented the 
U.S.  The African Union was represented by Sam Ibok and 
Boubou Niang.  The Chad Mediation team included Allam-mi 
Ahmad, General Khamis Ouardougou, and Ambassador Mahamat 
Habib Doutoum.  The Government of Sudan\'s delegation included 
General Mahamad Ahmed Mustapha Eldabi and Esmat Zain Alabdeen 
and Sudan\'s Ambassador to Chad Osman M.O. Dirar.  The 
European Union was represented by France\'s Ambassador to Chad 
Jean-Pierre Bercot.  Ezzedine Choukri-Fisher and Taye-Brook 
Zerihoun represented the United Nations.  Jaed A.A. 
Alhoudere, Libya\'s Ambassador to Chad, and the Nigerian 
Ambassador to Chad M.K.Y. Argungu also attended.  The Sudan 
Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) was represented by Adam 
Shogar and Jamal-Abdulrahman Arbab.  Ahmed Lissan Tugod spoke 
for the Movement for Justice and Equality (JEM).  JEM\'s other 
representative to the JC, Talgedin Niam, is in Libya.

MOVEMENTS NOT BUDGING ON GOVERNMENT WITHDRAWAL 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
3.  (C)  From the outset of the meeting, the Movements did 
not want to participate unless the Government withdrew from 
the positions it occupied during its offensive in December. 
However, Movement representatives Shogar and Tugod told P/E 
officer that they came to the meeting out of respect for JC 
Chairman Ali.  The movements insisted that the JC deal with 
the conclusions of the fifth session of the JC held in Abuja 
that called for the immediate cessation of the Government 
offensive and withdrawal of its troops to pre-December 8 
troop positions.  In addition, the Movements raised the 
military action at Mellit that had just commenced at the 
beginning of the JC meeting.  The Movements did not agree to 
the agenda, which had changed from the one distributed with 
the invitation to the meeting.  (Comment: The changed agenda 
was actually an improvement to the first one.  The AU and 
international community persuaded Ali to drop the agenda item 
pertaining to the Libyan proposal for a committee to verify 
the parties\' military positions on the ground.  Instead, the 
CFC will veryify pre-December 8 positions.  End Comment.)

4.  (C) General Mahamad Ahmed Mustapha Eldabi, leader of the 
Government of Sudan\'s delegation, said that the GOS has 
stopped fighting but is not withdrawing.  The GOS refused to 
allow the conclusions of the fifth session to be discussed 
before the conclusions of the fourth session, which included 
recommendations which the movements had not yet fulfilled. 
The GOS also challenged the rebel movements to declare their 
April 8 positions to the JC.  Aside from these issues, the 
 
 
GOS agreed to the JC\'s procedures and findings in an effort 
to look more cooperative than the Movements.  This included 
accepting the Chairman\'s conclusions which were critical of 
the GOS.  It also presented two papers entitled \"Positive 
Results of the Recent GOS Foperations for Public Security and 
Humanitarian Situation\" and \"GOS Proposals for Strengthening 
the JC\".

FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO END THE IMPASSE

5.  (C)  AU, Chad mediation team, and international community 
attempted to amend the agenda to allow both sides to talk 
about whatever they wanted whenever they wanted, hoping that 
the conclusions of the fourth and fifth sessions would 
eventually be covered.  For a number of hours, both sides 
traded accusations.  The JEM angrily presented a GOS letter 
dated December 13 which explained the offensive military 
operations to the CFC and notified rebel movements to move 
out of occupied areas within four hours.  The SLM/A and JEM 
continued to insist that the GOS declare whether or not its 
forces have withdrawn to pre-December 8 positions.

CEASE-FIRE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN\'S REPORT 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
6.  (C)  The report of Cease-fire Commission Chairman Festus 
Okonkwo confirmed that the Government had not withdrawn. 
Okonkwo said that the GOS had given maps of its positions to 
the CFC.  He told us privately, however, that the GOS noted 
on its maps that the rebels only held four positions.  This, 
according to Okonkwo, is not true.  The rebel movements 
pulled back during the offensive to avoid loss of life. 
Civilians bore the brunt of the Sudanese operations.  Okonkwo 
reported that since December 17, Darfur had remained 
relatively quiet.  A notable exception was an NMRD attack on 
a GOS firewood party on December 24, 2004.  The NMRD abducted 
one soldier and seized a GOS vehichle; both were released 
later. 
 
7.  (C) Okonkwo also told the JC that the failure of the 
movements to give the CFC their positions is seriously 
hindering his work.  He added that the deployment of 
additional monitors and protection forces and the 
verification of positions will be delayed without this 
information. 
 
8.  (C) The CFC reported that the GOS had responded to the 
list of prisoners given by the Movements.  The GOS claims 
that the persons on the list are accused of criminal activity 
and are not prisoners of war.  According to the GOS, 27 
persons are accused in the March 2003 coup attempt, 29 
persons are accused in the September 2004 coup attempts, 25 
persons are accused of forming cells to undermine the 
constitution, 10 were released from September to December 
2004 for lack of evidence, and fifteen persons on the list 
are not being detained by the Government. The Movements have 
not responded to the Government\'s list of \"hundreds\" of 
prisoners of war. The Movements told us, but not the JC, that 
they were working on it. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
CHAIRMAN\'S CONCLUSIONS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
9.  (SBU)  Chairman Ali noted that the CFC cannot discharge 
its mandate due to the parties\' failure to respect the 
decisions of the fourth and fifth JC sessions.  He stated the 
GOS needs to withdraw without delay to its pre-December 8 
positions, in particular from Marla, Ishma, and Labado.  The 
movements were requested not to occupy positions evacuated by 
the Government.  The CFC would verify the situation. 
(Comment: AU rep Ibok changed April 8 to December 8 in the 
first draft of Ali\'s conclusions.  End Comment.)  The JC 
asked the GOS should disarm the jandjaweed without delay. 
The movements must give their positions to the CFC and 
respond to the GOS list of prisoners of war.  Earlier in the 
meeting, but not in the conclusions, Ali indicated that the 
GOS should release the prisoners the movements listed, 
regardless of the \"criminal offenses\" with which they are 
 
 
charged.

10.  (C) As of January 3, Deputy Force Commander BG Jean 
Bosco Kazura and the Gambian Protection Force members arrived 
in Sudan.  According to Okonkwo, there are now 1059 personnel 
comprising 244 military observers, 789 Protection Force 
Members, eleven Cease-fire Commission members, nine 
international support staff and six civilian policemen.  The 
Protection Force members include: 201 Nigerians, 392 
Rwandans, and 196 Gambians.  There are seventeen AU military 
observers in Abeche, Chad.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FRENCH ROLE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
11.  (C) France\'s Ambassador to Chad Jean-Pierre Bercot, who 
is representing the EU, raised the issue of the NMRD in the 
opening round of discussion between the Chad mediation team, 
the African Union, and the international community.  Bercot 
asked whether or not the NMRD will be included in the peace 
process.  He wanted to know if the other rebel movements had 
been \"vacuumed\" up by the NMRD  Finally,  he asked if there 
had been any commission contact with the parties since Abuja 
to determine if progress can be made in the peace process. 
 
12.  (C)  Chairman Ali explained that the issue of including 
the NMRD in the Abuja process had been raised previously and 
the JEM had threatened to walk out if NMRD was included.  Ali 
said that the NMRD wants to be part of the process. However, 
Chad as mediator, cannot insist on it.  It is up to the AU 
and other members of the process to decide.  Ali told Bercot 
that the situation on the ground is not clear and that the 
AU\'s CFC is best-placed to answer that question.  Allam-mi 
Ahmad, Special Advisor to President Deby for International 
Relations and member of the Chad Mediation Team, said that 
the NMRD was not included because of questions about its 
legitimacy from the international community and AU.  He said 
that he hoped that a comprehensive agreement would eventually 
be reached that includes all Darfurian parties.  He warned 
that if the process with the SLM/A and JEM reaches an 
impasse, then the issue of which parties are included in the 
talks should be revisited. 
 
13.  (C) The AU\'s Sam Ibok and Chairman Ali said the NMRD is 
not part of the Abuja process, but that the Cease-fire 
Commission is talking with them.  Bercot persisted, saying 
that the European Union needed to know if the NMRD will be 
recognized as a party.  If not, Bercot queried, is the NMRD 
an interlocutor in the process?   Ibok told Bercot that the 
AU has many peace processes where not all the parties are 
involved directly, but are consulted.  During the second day 
of talks, Bercot rushed into the room with an \"important\" 
message for Ali.  At that time, rebel representatives 
observed Allam-mi giving Bercot a copy of the Chairman\'s 
conclusions hours before the meeting ended and well before 
any of the parties saw them.  This action heightened the 
movement\'s suspicions of the intentions of the French and of 
the JC procedures.  For the second time, it appeared the 
chairman\'s conclusions were written before the end of the 
meeting. 
 
- - - - - - 
WHAT\'S NEXT 
- - - - - - 
 
14.  (C)  The AU was discouraged by the inflexibility of both 
parties.  Ibok expressed his frustration several times during 
the meeting and suggested waiting until early February to 
begin the next round of talks.  Shogar and Tugod held a 
marathon meeting with JC Chairman Ali and Daoussa Deby, 
President Idriss Deby\'s brother, on January 5.  The outcome 
of that meeting was the possibility of holding another 
JC-like meeting in another two weeks.  This could occur in 
Addis Ababa.  During the JC, the Chad Mediation team passed 
out a draft terms of reference paper for the establishment of 
the Joint Humanitarian Facilitation and Monitoring Unit 
(JHFM) to be headquartered in El Fasher.  This draft will be 
 
 
considered at the next JC.  (Note: A copy of this document 
and the Chairman\'s conclusions were scanned to AF/SPG and 
Embassy Khartoum.  End Note.)  In the absence of AU personnel 
in N\'Djamena, P/E officer assisted in making arrangements for 
eight members of the movements, who have been stranded in 
Chad since December 22, to leave for El Fasher on January 6.

COMMENT 
- - - - 
 
15. (C)  No progress was made at this JC. The movements are 
losing faith in the AU\'s ability to enforce the JC\'s 
conclusions and remain suspicious of the JC procedures.  We 
are working with the AU and Ali on improving communications 
over procedural issues prior to the JC meetings in order to 
avoid arguing over the agenda for two days.  We also warned 
the movements that \"preconditions\" and the appearance of 
inflexiblity is playing into the hands of those who do not 
want the process to move forward and propose the NMRD as an 
alternative.  The GOS delegation seems confident in its 
ability to take actions without consequences for the peace 
process.  We are concerned that the French Ambassador\'s 
remarks about the NMRD may not reflect the EU position on the 
NMRD. 
 
16.  (U) Khartoum and Tripoli Minimize Considered.

SUBJECT: CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC REFUGEES: DON\'T FORGET US! 
 
 1.  Summary.  Central African refugees told Ambassador Wall 
not to forget their plight during his visit to Amboko Camp in 
Gore on December 14.  Amboko, in southern Chad near the 
border with Central African Republic, has been open since 
June 2003 and hosts 13,800 refugees who fled political unrest 
in their own country.  The refugees expressed concern that 
the humanitarian crisis in eastern Chad has overshadowed 
their situation.  They provided a list of needs, including 
insufficient food rations and other non-food items; 
insufficient construction materials, agricultural and 
educational needs; and finally, a lack of support for 
handicapped and vulnerable individuals.  The local Chadian 
population hosting the Central African Republic refugees is 
better off than their counterparts in eastern Chad.  However, 
local Chadian authorities pointed out disparities in 
educational facilities between the refugee camp and nearby 
schools.  End Summary.

AMBOKO CAMP 
- - - - - - 
 
2.  UNHCR Gore hosted Ambassador Wall, P/E officer, and 
commercial assistant to a visit to Amboko Refugee Camp on 
December 14.  The Governor of Doba Rodai Batinda and Prefet 
of Nyapende joined the U.S. delegation for the camp visit. 
The refugees organized a rousing arrival ceremony, with 
singing and dancing school children, a meeting with the 
refugee committee, and a tour of the medical facilities. 
Fifty-percent of the 13,800 refugees in the camp are from the 
Salamat and Ronga ethnic groups.  These Muslim traders were 
originally from Chad.  Forty-nine percent of the refugees are 
Christian farmers from the Kaba ethnic group.  The camp is 
divided into four zones, one inhabited by Muslims, two by 
Christians, and one is mixed.  All decisions are made by 
consensus and only carried out if approved by the presidents 
of all four zones.  UNHCR meets weekly with the refugee 
representatives, local authorities, and international 
partners to coordinate camp activities.  Africa Concern 
manages the camp.  UNHCR noted that the non-governmental 
organizations working in the camp need more training.

REFUGEES: DON,T FORGET US 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
3.  Leaders of the various refugee committees told Ambassador 
Wall that they appreciate the assistance of the United States 
and UNHCR.  However, they are concerned that the Central 
African refugees are being forgotten in the surge of donor 
activity to assist the Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad. 
They asked that donors treat all of the refugees equally. 
They also pointed out that some donors do not think of the 
Central African refugees as refugees any more. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
4.  Food distribution to Amboko camp continues to experience 
significant delays and irregularities.  During September, 
October, and November, food distributions were incomplete, 
delayed, or not received.  The refugees raised this issue and 
complained that the only food supplies they receive, when 
they receive it, are sorghum, beans, and oils.  They want a 
different source of protein.  WFP used 380 metric tons of 
sorghum from food stores for refugees in eastern Chad to 
ensure a food distribution took place in Amboko in December. 
Irregular food distribution has created a high level of 
tensions within the camp, putting humanitarian workers at 
risk.  UNHCR hopes that restoring regular distributions will 
lower the potential for unrest.  The access road from Gore to 
the camp remains in bad condition and UNHCR proposes that a 
food-for-work program be used to improve the road and employ 
refugees.  Sections of the road from Gore to Moundou have 
recently been graded.  There also is discussion of improving 
a local airstrip near Gore to improve access and regularize 
 
assistance deliveries.  In addition, the road from Moundou to 
Gore is vulnerable to banditry. 
 
- - - - - - - - 
MEDICAL CENTER 
- - - - - - - - 
 
5.  The refugees raised concern over the departure of 
MSF-Belgium from the camp.  MSF-Belgium established and 
managed the medical center at the camp, but a headquarters 
decision was made that the emergency is over and MSF-Belgium 
is needed elsewhere.  Malaria is the key medical issue in the 
camp.  One case per week of severe malnourishment is 
registered each week.  COOPI, an Italian non-governmental 
organization plans to take over health care operations in 
January 2005. 
 
- - - - 
HOUSING 
- - - - 
 
6.  The camp residents want more construction materials to 
build homes, particularly roofing to withstand the heavy 
rains.  All refugees have tents, but many want more permanent 
structures.  African Concern is helping the refugees build 
mud and brick homes.  Over 400 have been constructed in the 
last quarter of 2004.  Many refugees have built homes on 
their own. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
REFUGEES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
7.  The refugees emphasized the issue of persons with special 
needs.  The camp has a significant number of physically 
disabled refugees, blind persons, and widows.  The refugees 
noted that the handicapped have no way of getting around or 
any activities to keep them occupied or generate revenue. 
African Concern and Notre Dame de la Paix are implementing a 
program to assist these vulnerable groups. 
 
- - - - - 
EDUCATION 
- - - - - 
 
8.  Heavy rains have badly damaged the camp school, which had 
been hastily constructed during the emergency phase of the 
operation.  Currently, fourteen buildings host 1800 refugee 
children; 1200 boys and 600 girls.  Although the rate of 
girls not attending school is not considered high, a school 
feeding program has been proposed to attract more girls.  The 
refugees would like assistance for the high-school aged 
children, who have to walk seven kilometers to attend class 
in Gore.  For the adults, the refugees would like a technical 
skills center and the opportunity to participate in 
micro-enterprises.  After leaving the camp, local authorities 
showed the Ambassador a school nearby school attended by 
Chadian children which consisted of a thatched structure and 
an outdoor blackboard. 
 
- - - - - - - 
CAMP SECURITY 
- - - - - - - 
 
9.  All Central African refugees were admitted to Chad, but 
an official registration has not yet been done.  UNHCR 
reports that the security in the camp is precarious.  There 
are reports of ex-liberators in the camp, which has 
heightened security concerns. There are two Chadian 
policemen, two gendarmes, and six soldiers providing camp 
security.   UNHCR recommends that security is reinforced to 
the same level of the camps in eastern Chad.  The salaries of 
the security personnel in the camp have recently have been 
increased. 
 
- - - - 
COMMENT 
 
- - - - 
 
10.  There was no discussion of when the Central African 
refugees would return to their country.  Amboko has more of a 
village feel to it than a refugee camp.  It was clear from 
the refugee demands that they are struggling with being in 
stage of limbo two years after their arrival to Chad.  The 
Chadian Government is disappointed that the camp management 
is being turned over to another international organization 
(Africa Concern) rather than a Chadian-based non-governmental 
organization.

 1.  (C) SUMMARY.  During a visit to Moundou on December 13, 
a ruling party member treated Ambassador Wall to a tour 
d,horizon of key issues facing Chad.  Masagar Mbairidoum 
Lucas, the Secretary General of Moundou, described growing 
security problems, societal violence, and the culture of 
impunity gripping the country.  He cited the weakness of 
Chad,s opposition parties as a reason for public 
acquiescence to the ruling Movement for Patriotic Salvation 
(MPS).  Lucas, comments about President Deby,s quest for a 
third term are an indication of the level of dissatisfaction 
among some members of the ruling party.  END SUMMARY.

STRANGE TWIST

2.  (C) Ambassador Wall was scheduled to meet with Governor 
Mahamat Bechir Cherif.  Upon arrival, security at the 
Governor,s residence indicated that the Cherif was in his 
office.  Instead, the Ambassador, P/E officer, and commercial 
specialist were shown into the office of the Secretary 
General, Masagar Mbairidoum Lucas.  Lucas explained that the 
Governor was busy making arrangements for President Deby,s 
trip to the region the following week and could not see the 
Ambassador.

CULTURE OF IMPUNITY

3.  (C) Lucas provided a surprisingly frank assessment of the 
current state of affairs in Chad for a ruling party insider. 
Lucas stated that the justice system in Chad does not work. 
Judges are killed, threatened, and too afraid to do their 
jobs.  A culture of impunity reigns.  Lucas said that the 
justice system must be made to serve the people.  If a 
country has a strong judicial system, the actions of a head 
of state are not as important.  The fact that Chadians cannot 
afford to eat, travel safely, or get paid regularly indicates 
that there is a problem in Chad.  To make matters worse, 
Chadians are victims of those who extort money and carry out 
attacks along the roads.  According to Lucas, prior to ousted 
former President Hissein Habre\'s rule, Chadians were safe. 
Lucas stated that Deby,s critical mistake was not 
dismantling Habre,s security apparatus.  Habre,s people are 
still a key component of the security services.

THIRD TERM

4.  (C)  Lucas did not hesitate to criticize plans for 
President Deby to stay on for a third term.  God gave Deby 
power but he is losing his good grace, Lucas stated.  Leaders 
need to leave power when the time comes.  One must do what is 
best for the country.  Deby should allow someone else to take 
over, Lucas argued.  He did not doubt that the upcoming 
referendum would result in amending the constitution to 
permit Deby to serve additional terms.

OPPOSITION BANKRUPT

5.  (C)  There is no real opposition in Chad, Lucas lamented, 
and this allows the ruling party to remain in power. 
Opposition deputies make a lot of noise but what have they 
delivered to their constituencies, he asked.  The lack of a a 
viable opposition political platform allows the ruling party 
to take credit for programs that were started long before 
Deby came along.  For example, the original oil exploration 
was begun in the late 1980s, yet Deby uses the oil project as 
proof of his effectiveness. Lucas asked what has Deby done to 
improve the state of the roads in Chad.   (Note: Quite a lot, 
actually.  End Note.) 
 
6.  (C) Lucas left Lol Choua,s opposition RDP party in April 
because he felt that the opposition was not presenting a 
platform to the public.  He told President Deby when he 
agreed to join the ruling Movement for Patriotic Salvation 
that he would be frank and honest about how he saw things. 
He described himself as an &old man8 without higher 
political ambitions so he does not have to worry if Deby does 
 
 
not like what he says.

FARMER-HERDER VIOLENCE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
7.  (C) Lucas explained that the level of societal violence 
in Chad is rising because of weak local administration and 
the growing intolerance between groups being promoted by the 
regime.  During the period of disorder after the civil war, 
Lucas said, there were often cases of squatters taking over 
fields held by others.  Herders are better armed now because 
weapons are easily available through Chad,s porous borders. 
They need the arms to protect themselves from the increasing 
number of bandits and cattle thieves. 
 
8.  (C)  Land chiefs previously settled disputes between 
farmers and herders.  However, prefets and gendarmes became 
involved in dispute resolution, and traditional methods of 
conflict resolution are now not respected.  Currently, 
justice goes to the party that pays the official the most. 
This has created a spiral of violence and intolerance between 
farmers and herders.  In addition, Lucas believes that the 
herders, search for water points and pasturage for their 
cattle, particularly by Peuhl herders from Niger and 
Cameroon, has increased the number of recent conflicts. 
There are many situations were the violence is 
herder-on-herder, not herder versus farmer.  Lucas pointed 
out that southerners also raise cattle and that there are 
associations in the region trying to regulate the growing 
problems and reduce the level of violence.

COMMENT

9.  (C)  Lucas is a southerner, and his views reflect 
southern discontent with the Zaghawa-dominated government and 
upcoming referendum.  But we find it interesting that his 
boss sent him to talk with the Ambassador.  Governor Cherif, 
a northerner who is close to Deby, may have preferred to use 
his deputy to deliver a perspective he was not comfortable 
delivering himself.  Lucas, who claimed to have nothing to 
lose politically, obviously had no such reservations.
