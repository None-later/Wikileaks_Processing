2.  SUMMARY: CANADIANS FIND LTTE HAS LITTLE SYMPATHY HERE 
AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO BECOME ACTIVE AGAIN IN TAMIL NADU. 
POLICE COMMISSIONER BELIEVES THERE ARE STILL 3,000 LTTE 
MEN IN TAMIL NADU, MOST WITH WEAPONS OF SOME KIND. 
ACCORDING TO S. RAMACHANDRAN, CHIEF MINISTER MGR IS \"OK\" 
AND RETURNING OCTOBER 31.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
3.  CANADIAN DEPUTY HIGH COMMISSIONER GARY SMITH AND 
IMMIGRATION COUNSELOR DEL MCKAY SHARED WITH US THE RESULTS 
OF THEIR THREE-DAY VISIT TO MADRAS AND ENVIRONS.  PAIR 
SAID THEIR TALKS CONFIRMED \"REAL MADRAS DISINTEREST\" IN THE 
LTTE, THOUGH NOTING (AS OTHER OBSERVERS HAVE) THAT FULL- 
SCALE SLAUGHTER OF LTTE COULD INCREASE TENSION.  POLICE 
AND COMMISSIONER DEVARAM TOLD THEM THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
(GOTN) ESTIMATES THERE ARE STILL 3,000 LTTE MEMBERS IN 
TAMIL NADU AND THAT MOST OF THEM HAVE AT LEAST RETAINED 
THEIR SIDEARMS, IF NOT OTHER WEAPONS.   NEITHER POLICE 
NOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS EXPECT LTTE TO BECOME ACTIVE 
HERE AGAIN.  SMITH ADDED THAT SEVERAL POLICE OFFICIALS 
APPEARED EAGER TO CRACK DOWN ON THEM IF THEY DID (THIS 
SQUARES WITH OUR READINGS, TOO). 
 
4.  HOME SECRETARY T. VENKATRAMAN SEEMED VERY RELAXED 
OVER THE RECENT SPATE OF DMK, DK AND OTHER ARRESTS WHICH 
HAVE NETED ABOUT 7,000 PEOPLE (SEE ALSO REFTEL).  ABOUT 
400 OF THE LEADERS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO A PRISON 
\"OUTSIDE\" MADRAS WHERE THE WILL BE HELD FOR A FEW DAYS 
TO COOL OFF.  SMITH ADDED THAT VENKATRAMAN CERTAINLY 
WASN\'T GOING TO STAY LATE AT THE OFFICE TO FOLLOW THE 
MATTER AND CITED THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF 
RELAXED VIEW HELD BY MOST GOTN OFFICIALS THEY SPOKE WITH. 
 
5.  CANADIANS SAW FOOD MINISTER S. RAMACHANDRAN (RAM) 
EVENING OCTOBER 28.  RAM CONFIRMED TODAY\'S PRESS REPORTS 
THAT MGR WILL RETURN TO MADRAS MID-MORNING OCTOBER 31 
VIA BOMBAY.  RAM SAID MGR WAS \"OK, BUT PRESSED AS TO 
WHETHER HE WAS \"HEALTHY,\" SAID NO.

SUBJECT: N. RAM: LTTE CRUSHED, MAHATHAYA DEAD? 
 
1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  \"THE HINDU\" ASSOCIATE EDITOR N. RAM JUST RETURNED 
FROM A VISIT TO COLOMBO, WHERE HE INTERVIEWED JAYAWARDENE 
AND SPOKE TO MEMBERS OF IPKF, JOURANLISTS AND OTHERS.  HE 
OFFERED THESE THOUGHTS TO CG AND POLECON OFF AT LUNCH 
NOVEMBER 2.: 
 
3. ACCORDING TO JAYAWARDENE AND IPKF SOURCES, THE LTTE 
HAS BEEN CRUSHED AND IS ON THE RUN.  BASED ON LTTE 
INTERCEPTS, RAM IS ALMOST SURE THAT MAHATHAYA (THE LTTE 
NO. 2) WAS KILLED IN THE ASSULT ON CHAVAKACHERI.  INTERCEPTS 
SAID THAT SOMEONE AT THE VERY TOP, BUT NOT PRABHAKARAN, 
WAS KILLED.  RAM BELIEVES THAT THIS COULD ONLY DESCRIBE 
MAHATHAYA.  LOCAL PRESS HAS REPORTED UNCONFIRMED RUMORS 
OF HIS DEATH.  LTTE\'S YOGI HAD TOLD RAM EARLIER THAT 
MAHATHAYA WAS LTTE\'S CANDIDATE FOR CHIEF MINISTER OF THE 
NORTHERN AND EASTERN PROVINCE.  RAM SAID THAT THE INDIAN 
MILITARY ALSO FOUND HIM TO BE SOMEONE WITH WHOM THEY COULD 
DEAL.  HIS DEATH, UNLIKE PRABHAKARNA\'S, WOULD BE A BLOW 
TO A FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS. 
 
4.  PRABHAKARAN WAS \"CERTAINLY\" BEEN WOUNDED IN A 
SEPARATE INCIDENT, PROBABLY WHEN INDIAN PARATROOPERS 
LANDED NEAR HIS HEADWUARTERS.  RAM ALSO FINDS IT VERY 
CURIOUS THAT PRABHAKARAN\'S NAME HAS NOT BEEN USED AT 
ALL BY THE LTTE RECENTLY -\"HE\'S COMPLETELY OUT OF SIGHT.\" 
 
5.  RAM ESTIMATES THAT 1,000 LTTE FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN 
KILLED, INCLUDING 700 IN THE ASSAULT ON CHAVAKACHERI ALONE. 
 
6.  RAM\'S BASIC VIEW OF RECENT EVENTS IN JAFFNA IS MORE 
POSITIVE (FROM AN INDIAN PERSPECTIVE) THAN WE HAVE HEARD 
FROM ANY OTHER KNOWLEDGABLE SOUCE HERE.  IT MUST BE 
CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OF HIS RECENT TRIP TO 
COLOMBO AND HIS EARLIER PRE-AGREEMENT CONCERN FOR THE LTTE. 
SUBSTANTIAL CROSS CURRENTS IN TAMIL ELITE OPINION PREVENT 
US FROM DISCERNING ANY \"LINE\" DOMINANT HERE.  NO ONE HAS 
MUCH REAL SYMPATHY FOR THE LTTE; KARUNANIDI AND THE DMK 
SUPPORT THEM FOR OPPORTUNISTIC REASONS, AND EVEN MGR\'S 
RETURN (BEING COVERED SEPTEL) HAS NOT YET CLARIFIED AIADMK 
THINKING ON THE SUBJECT. 
 
7.  ONE THING RAM WAS CLEAR ON: THE GOI WILL NOT BE 
EASILY LED INTO ANY KIND OF COMPROMISE.  GURKHA TROOPS ARE 
SURROUNDING THE NALLUR TEMPLE NEAR JAFFNA, AND THERE 
WILL BE NO STAND-DOWN, SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS, OR 
CEASE FIRE UNTIL THE LTTE LOUDLY AND PUBLICLY AGREES TO 
START HANDING OVER ARMS AND ABIDE BY THE JULY 29 AGREEMENT. 
RAM CONFIRMED THE EARLIER REPORTED \"NECKLACE KILLINGS\" 
OF FIVE INDIAN SOLDIERS AND THE BRUNING TO DEATH OF 13 
OTHERS.  HE HASTENED TO ADD THAT NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN 
CONFIRMED TO THE PRESS BECUASE THE GOI WANTED TO KEEP 
EMOTIONS DOWN.  BUT THE ARMY KNOWS, AND IT IS PRETTY 
BLOODY-MINDED RIGHT NOW.  PRABHAKARAN OR ANY OTHER 
LEADERSHIP FIGURE WOULD HAVE TO \"WAVE A VERY WHITE 
FLAG\" TO SURVIVE HIS/THEIR OWN SURRENDER.

          BECOMING THE LTTE\'S ELDER STATESMAN? 
 
1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  CHIEF MINISTER KARUNANIDHI\'S OBVIOUS TILT 
TOWARDS THE LTTE IS GENERATING WIDESPREAD CONTROVERSY AND 
DISMAY IN TAMIL NADU, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE DMK 
LEADER\'S STRAINED RELATIONS WITH THE TIGERS IN THE PAST. 
SINCE DECEMBER, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS, 
THE CHIEF MINISTER HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO 
DEMONSTRATE HIS COMMITMENT TO THE TIGERS -- AT WHAT WOULD 
APPEAR TO BE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL COST.  NO POLITICAL 
FIGURE  HERE, LEAST OF ALL FROM THE DMK, CAN EXPLAIN 
TO ANYONE\'S SATISFACTION THE GAMEBOOK KARUNANIDHI IS 
USING.  AS HE BECOMES MORE AND MORE OF A \"TAMIL EELAM 
HARDLINER\", SOME MAY FEEL HE IS BURNING BRIDGES 
WITH DELHI.  WE ARE AT PRESENT BAFFLED. 
END SUMMARY 
 
 
3.  TAMIL NADU CHIEF MINISTER KARUNANIDHI\'S SUDDEN AND 
COMPLETE IDENTIFICATION WITH THE LTTE IS GENERATING STRONG 
POLITICAL CONTROVERSY IN THE STATE.  RECENT EVIDENCE OF 
HIS TILT IN FAVOR OF THE TIGERS ABOUNDS: HIS KIND WORDS 
FOR LTTE HOSPITALITY AFTER THEIR ABDUCTION OF TAMIL NADU 
FISHERMEN ALLEGEDLY IN SRI LANKAN WATERS AND HIS PRAISE 
FOR THE LTTE FOR \"PROTECTING\" A SECOND 
GROUP OF FISHERMEN \"CAPTURED\" BY THE SRI LANKAN NAVY, HIS 
REFUSAL TO PERMIT TAMIL REFUGEES ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER 
MILITANT GROUPS TO LAND IN THE STATE, AND HIS 
BLATANT REFUSAL TO ATTEND AN IPKF WELCOME RECEPTION IN 
MADRAS MARCH 25 (MADRAS 1034).  SOME OBSERVERS FEEL THERE 
MAY BE A DEEPER DESIGN TO THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S PRO-LTTE 
STANCE. 
 
4.  THE CONTROVERSY HAS SPREAD TO THE FLOOR OF THE TAMIL 
NADU LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY-  CONGRESS(I) MLA\'S, ALONG 
WITH THEIR AIADMK ALLIES, CHALLENGED THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S 
PATRIOTISM FOR NOT ATTENDINO LAST MONTH\'S IPKF RECEPTION 
AND HIS CRITICISM OF THE BEHAVIOR OF THE IPKF, AND 
FOLLOWED THEIR HARSH WORDS WITH A WALKOUT BY ALL CONGRESS 
AND AIADMK MLA\'S.  THE LOCAL PRESS JOINED THE 
FRAY BY ALMOST UNIVERSALLY CRITICIZING THE CHIEF 
MINISTER\'S BEHAVIOR TOWARDS THE IPKF JAWANS.  EVEN THE 
DMK\'S OWN ALLIES, SUCH AS CPI(M) MLA K. RAMANI, 
TOOK EXCEPTION TO THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S INSULT TO THE 
INDIAN ARMY. 
 
5.  FEW PUNDITS WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MACHIAVELLIAN 
KARUNANIDHI DISPLAYS RELUCTANCE TO CHANGE SIDES WHEN 
POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY DICTATES.  HOWEVER, HIS CURRENT KIND 
WORDS FOR AND BLATANT SUPPORT IN FAVOR OF THE LTTE APPEAR 
TO BAFFLE THE DMK\'S PARTNER, JANATA DAL, AS WELL AS THE 
ADVERSARY CONGRESS(I).  UPON REGAINING POWER IN JANUARY 
1989, KARUNANIDHI COOPERATED WITH DELHI, MET ON 
NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WITH RAJIV GANDHI AND REFRAINED FROM 
ANY OVERT CRITICISM OF THE PRIME MINISTER\'S SRI LANKAN 
POLICIES.  WHEN THE NEWLY ELECTED NATIONAL FRONT 
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO WITHDRAW THE IPKF BY 
MARCH 31, KARUNANIDHI INSISTED THAT A PACT AMONG 
THE RIVAL TAMIL MILITANT GROUPS BE PURSUED. 
FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS, HE ENGAGED IN FRUITLESS 
MEDIATION TALKS TO THIS END. 
 
6.  THE LTTE HAD NEVER BEEN KARUNANIDHI\'S FAVORITE SRI 
LANKAN TAMIL MILITANT GROUP, PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF THEIR 
CLOSE TIES WITH HIS ARCH-RIVAL, THE LATE M.G. RAMACHANDRAN 
IN FACT HIS DISDAIN FOR THE GROUP WAS MANIFESTED 
OFTEN IN THE PAST.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE DMK CAME BACK TO 
POWER, THE LTTE MADE OVERTURES TO THE NEW TAMIL 
NADU GOVERNMENT, TO WHICH THEY RECEIVED LITTLE RESPONSE. 
ONCE THE MEDIATTION TALKS BEGAN IN DECEMBER, AND 
SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE LTTE\'S ANTON BALA- 
SINGHAM AND KARUNANIDHI, THE CHIEF MINISTER CHOSE TO 
IGNORE THE OTHER GROUPS, ADVISING THEM TO BURY THEIR 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE LTTE AND SUPPORT THEIR OBVIOUS POWER 
POSITION AND ASSIST IN DEVELOPING A VIABLE TAMIL POLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT.  EPRLF LEADERS, INCLUDING TAMIL PROVINCE 
CHIEF MINISTER VARADARAJA PERUMAL, ARE BELIEVED TO 
HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE GOI THAT KARUNANIDHI HAD TURNED 
PARTIAL. 
 
7.  HARD EVIDENCE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S CHANGE OF 
HEART TOWARDS THE LTTE EMERGED AT THE FEBRUARY DMK 
STATE CONFERENCE IN TRICHY.  WITH HIS NEPHEW, UNION 
MINISTER MURASOLI MARAN, PRESENT ON THE DAIS, KARUNANIDHI 
HIMSELF READ OUT THE PARTY\'S RESOLUTION WHICH ENDORSED 
THE LTTE\'S BRAVE AND SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE AGAINST THE 
INDIAN ARMY. 
 
 
8.  COMMENT:  WHAT LIES BEHIND THE CHIEF MINISTER\'S 
PUZZLING VOLTA FACE?  EVEN SOME DMK COLLEAGUES HAVE 
CONFESSED TO CONSULATE REPS THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA, 
ALTHOUGH VARIOUS THEORIES ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN 
COFFEE HOUSES, NEWSPAPER OFFICES AND PARTY HEADQUARTERS. 
WHILE ALL AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE 
FOR KARUNANIDHI TO CONTINUE OVERT SUPPORT FOR THE 
SEVERAL LOSERS AMONG THE SRI LANKAN TAMIL POLITICAL 
GROUPS, HIS ENERGETIC AND UNWAVERING AND TOTALLY 
UNCRITICAL AGREEMENT WITH THE LTTE\'S EVERY MOVE IS 
RAISING NUMEROUS EYEBROWS, AND ALIENATING MEMBERS OF 
HIS OWN PARTY. 
 
9.  ONE EXTREME VIEW, TO WHICH WE DO NOT SUBSCRIBE, IS 
THAT KARUNANIDHI IS INTERESTED IN A TAMIL EELAM VARIANT 
FOR HIS INDIAN STATE.  ANOTHER, PERHAPS MORE CREDIBLE 
THEORY, IS THAT THE LTTE HAS THREATENED KARUNANIDHI WITH 
A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF MILITANT 
VIOLENCE IN TAMIL NADU, ENOUGH PERHAPS TO LEAD TO THE 
IMPOSITION OF PRESIDENT\'S RULE, IF HE DOESN\'T BOOST 
THEIR CAUSE.  OTHERS POINT OUT THAT THE CHIEF MINISTER, 
THOUGH A CHARTER MEMBER, WAS NEVER AN ENTHUSIASTIC 
ADHERENT OF THE NATIONAL FRONT (AND IN FACT JUST 
ABSENTED HIMSELF FROM THE NATIONAL INTEGRATION COUNCIL 
SESSION IN DELHI) AND MAY BE CARVING OUT A PLACE 
WHERE HE CAN POSITION HIMSELF IN A POST VP SINGH WORLD. 
STILL OTHER LOCAL INTERLOCUTORS POINT TO HIS INCREASING 
WITHDRAWAL FROM PERSONAL CONTACT (NO PRIVATE PRESS 
INTERVIEWS AND FEW ONE-ON-ONE MEETINGS) AND CONCLUDE 
HE IS LOSING HIS ONCE FIRM AND CANNY GRIP ON TAMIL NADU 
POLITICAL LIFE.  THERE ARE ALSO THOSE WHO CONTINUE 
TO BELIEVE THAT HE SINCERELY DEDICATED HIMSELF TO THE 
EARLIER NEGOTIATIONS, WANTS TO BRING ABOUT REAL PEACE 
AMONG THE SRI LANKAN TAMILS, AND BELIEVES THAT HE 
CAN ONLY POSITION HIMSELF TO RESUME THESF DISCUSSIONS 
IF HIS CREDIBILITY WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT PLAYER -- 
THE LTTE -- IS UNQUESTIONED. 
 
10.  WE QUICKLY ADMIT THAT WE DON\'T KNOW THE ANSWERS. 
HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE KARUNANIDHI IS CRACKING UP NOR 
DO WE THINK THAT HE IS ABOUT TO JOIN A MOVEMFNT FOR A 
GREATER TAMIL INDEPENDENT STATE.  WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT 
HE IS UP TO SOMETHING AND IN THE ABSENCE OF HIS CHIEF 
CHUM AND ADVISOR, NEPHEW MURASOLI MARAN, IS CONFIDING 
IN NO ONE.

1. (U) SUMMARY: The current split in the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) hamstrings the Sri Lankan 
peace process and might even degenerate into a 
\"bloodbath,\" warned security analysts who met DAS 
Donald Camp during his May 15 visit to Chennai.  They 
predicted a standoff between Karuna, the better 
general, and Prabhakaran, the autocrat who brooks no 
dissent.  Indian state government officials foresaw an 
interruption of refugee repatriations.  All feared that 
a multi-polar state, ideal for breeding terrorists, 
might emerge.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Analysts See Stalemate, Covert Ops, Muslim Alienation 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2. (U) \"This is going to lead to a stalemate that will 
hinder peace moves,\" lamented V. Suryanarayanan, former 
Director, Center for South East Asian Studies, 
University of Madras.  Other speakers at the Observer 
Research Foundation (ORF) expressed complementary 
views.  Colonel Hariharan, former Chief of Military 
Intelligence of the Indian peacekeeping Force in Sri 
Lanka, indicated that Karuna was a better general than 
Prabhakaran and would likely win any conventional 
confrontation.  So, he hypothesized that \"a covert 
operation is likely to have already been launched\" to 
assassinate Karuna.  B. Raman, former additional 
director of the Research and Analysis Wing (India\'s 
CIA), added that Karuna, no fool, would not have split 
from Prabhakaran unless he sensed growing popular 
discontent in the East against Prabhakaran\'s northern 
LTTE faction.  Raman added that Karuna must have 
believed that Prabhakaran planned to eliminate him so 
he defected, with a powerful force, while he still 
could. 
 
3. (U) ORF panelists described the current split as a 
defining event for the LTTE.  \"The image that the LTTE 
is a monolithic structure is broken once and for all,\" 
V. Suryanrayanan noted.  The apparent failure of the 
LTTE\'s famed intelligence wing to prevent this crisis 
stunned the analysts.  \"Looks like intelligence outfits 
of non-state actors are as fallible as their state 
counterparts,\" A.S. Paneerselvam, Sun Television 
network\'s chief news editor, observed.  T.S. 
Subramanium, special correspondent, Frontline Magazine, 
predicted that \"Pottu (LTTE\'s Intelligence Chief) will 
pay with his life\" for the oversight. 
 
4. (U) ORF panelists also predicted increasing 
alienation among Sri Lankan Muslims.  They noted that 
neither Prabhakaran nor Karuna offered Muslims hope of 
adequate representation in any government.  This, 
coupled with a growing sense of Muslim identity, 
virtually ensured alienation with potential for 
extremism.  The panel referenced previous calls for a 
\"separate Muslim police force\" and the flow of Gulf 
money to Sri Lanka as evidence.  They noted a \"rich 
potential for radicalization,\" and hinted at others who 
would want to take advantage of the situation, gliding 
into references to what they called Lashkar-e-Toiba 
\"sleeper cells\" in South India and especially 
Hyderabad.  They implied that the Muslims of Eastern 
Sri Lanka could be ripe for such contacts. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
State Officials Fear For Security and Refugees 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5. (U) \"We are watching the situation for it has 
security implications for the state,\" Lakshmi Pranesh, 
Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) 
offered at a separate meeting between DAS Camp and GoTN 
officers.  Her statement echoed earlier reports of 
Indian concern (REF A).  The GoTN fears the LTTE split 
will stop the repatriation of Sri Lankan refugees from 
Tamil Nadu (REF B).  \"We repatriated 1500 refugees last 
year,\" T. Pitchandi, Secretary Public and 
Rehabilitation, told DAS Camp.  The GoTN continues to 
work with the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in 
Chennai to facilitate issuing Sri Lankan travel 
documents for the refugees (REF C). 
 
6. (U) COMMENT: South Indian security experts have 
warned that the LTTE\'s split may signal a tectonic 
shift in Sri Lanka\'s political environment that could 
have international repercussions.  India\'s Tamil Nadu 
state has already considered the implications for its 
refugee population.  In the shadow of the current 
crisis, South India feels vulnerable to a break down in 
Sri Lanka.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: DUMPING DUTIES ARE LEAST OF SHRIMP FARMERS\' 
WORRIES 
 
REF: CHENNAI 00944 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Early fears that USDOC anti-dumping 
duties on warm water shrimp from India could become a hot- 
button political issue appear to be groundless.  Shrimp 
farmers do not blame the duties for their problems, but 
rather four years of slumping international demand. 
While politicians initially rallied to the farmers\' 
cause, interest has waned, and the current political 
configuration makes future action unlikely.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
SHRIMPING INDUSTRY ON DECLINE FOR PAST FOUR YEARS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (U) To gauge the effects of the recent USDOC anti- 
dumping duties on shrimp farmers in Andhra Pradesh, Post 
spoke to farmers in the East Godhavari district as well 
as other industry experts.  Located in northeastern 
Andhra Pradesh, the East Godhavari region saw a shrimping 
boom in the 1990s.  However, according to the farmers, 
the good times came to an end four years ago, when a 
series of shocks hit the industry.  First, \"white spot\" 
disease struck the shrimp farms, forcing farmers to use 
more antibiotics than European Union phyto-sanitary 
regulations allowed.  In 2002, Japanese importers 
complained that Indian shrimp had a \"muddy smell.\" 
Closing this second international market dropped the 
price of 20-count shrimp from USD 9.50 to USD 6.50. 
 
3. (U) The drop in shrimp prices over the past four years 
mirrored an increase in feed supply prices, worsening the 
situation for farmers.  According to Bakshinathan, 
Assistant Director of the Shrimp Authority of India - 
Tamil Nadu, South Indian farmers rely on fishmeal 
imported from Thailand, Chile, and Peru.  Global weather 
patterns have reduced the supply of fishmeal from these 
countries, boosting the price.  Because of this, 
Bakshinathan said, \"The industry is going through a 
difficult period.  Farm gate prices have been falling, 
making the activity unprofitable.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
SHRIMP FARMERS DO NOT BLAME WOES ON ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4. (U) Following the anti-dumping duties in 2004, the 
price of a kilogram of 20-count shrimp dropped to USD 
5.90.  While farmers noted the effect of the duties on 
their industry, they felt that the penalties were not 
solely responsible for the decline.  According to 
Maniraju, President of the Aquaculture and Shrimp Farmers 
Association of the East Godhavari District, \"The duties 
are just one more problem in a long list of 
difficulties.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
AFTER INITIAL ACTIONS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT INDIFFERENT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (U) Initial reports indicated that the Andhra Pradesh 
state government might take up the farmers\' cause at the 
national level.  Shortly after the imposition of the 
duties, Chief Minister Y.S. Rajashekar Reddy sent a 
letter to the prime minister urging action on the matter 
(Reftel).  In addition, former BJP president Venkaiah 
Naidu\'s personal shrimping interests in Vishakapatnam led 
him to raise the issue.  However, East Godhavari shrimp 
farmers told Post that these efforts soon tailed off. 
According to Maniraju, Reddy was simply paying lip 
service to pre-election promises.  Maniraju added that 
local leadership has been even less responsive.  When 
asked about the needs of shrimp farmers in East 
Godhavari, Arun Kumar, the Member of Parliament 
representing the area, stated that he believed the 
activity was not environmentally friendly. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
EXPORTERS MAD, BUT DUTIES NO LONGER A POLITICAL ISSUE 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
6. (SBU) COMMENT: It seems unlikely that the anti-dumping 
duties will be as important a political issue as once 
thought.  Early reports that they could hurt bilateral 
relations appear to have been misleading.  After an 
initial flurry of activity, local and state politicians 
seem to have dropped the farmers\' cause.  Local Congress 
leadership seems unlikely to assume a cause that would 
indirectly help a prominent former BJP leader.  In 
addition, fear of losing domestic suppliers may have 
prompted shrimp exporters to overstate the farmers\' anger 
and political muscle.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: \"NON-FUNCTIONAL\" TAMIL NADU ANTI-CONVERSION ACT NOW 
\"DEAD\" 
 
REF: 03 Chennai 675 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  After defeat at the polls in May, Tamil 
Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa quickly reversed a number 
of initiatives that she had undertaken during the previous 
three years.  Among the reversals was the controversial 
Tamil Nadu Anti-Conversion Law banning forcible religious 
conversions.  The Anti-Conversion Law, which the government 
never enforced, is now history.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------ 
The Anti-Conversion Law & Its Repeal 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) In October 2002, the Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) 
proposed an ordinance banning religious conversions that are 
carried out by \"force, allurement, or fraudulent means\" 
(REFTEL).  The GoTN framed rules to implement the Anti- 
Conversion Law and passed it by ordinance in March 2003. 
Passage by ordinance does not require approval by the state 
legislature.  Following her defeat in the May, 2004 
parliamentary elections, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister 
Jayalalithaa announced the repeal of the Anti-Conversion Law 
along with a variety of other policy course changes ranging 
from reinstatement of free power for farmers to free bus 
passes for students.  Two senior GoTN officials recently 
confirmed to Pol Off the repeal of the Anti-Conversion Law, 
and the fact that no legislative approval is required to 
implement its repeal.  Mr. T. Pitchandi, GoTN Secretary for 
Public and Rehabilitation, pronounced the post-mortem, \"The 
anti-conversion bill is dead\". 
 
---------------------- 
A \"Non-Functional\" Law 
---------------------- 
 
3. (U) Mr. Ramagopalan, who convened the Hindu Munnani, an 
NGO espousing Hindu causes, described the Anti-Conversion 
Law as \"non-functional.\"  He added, \"The Hindu Munnani filed 
over 1,000 cases of conversions in 2003 but police stations 
did not take appropriate action to register them.\"  Vishwa 
Hindu Parishad (VHP) General Secretary Mr. R. Narayanswami 
said that even after passing the act in 2003 the government 
\"did not make sincere efforts to identify conversions\" that 
took place in Tamil Nadu.  He blamed this inaction on the 
state government\'s concern about not antagonizing minority 
voters in the run-up to the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. 
Christian authorities confirmed that conversions of Tamil 
Nadu citizens continued during 2003-2004 but were performed 
out of state. 
 
-------------------------- 
Repeal & Its Repercussions 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (U) COMMENT: All communities agreed that the reversal of 
the Anti-Conversion Law was a clear attempt by Chief 
Minister Jayalalithaa to regain popularity in the wake of 
the 2004 elections.  Following a huge electoral defeat, 
Jayalalithaa announced the reversal of many measures taken 
over the last three years including abandoning the 
controversial Anti-Conversion Law.  While she presumably 
hopes reversing the law will attract votes from some who 
voted against her party in May, Hindu groups suggest her 
party may lose some share of the majority Hindu vote.  Mr. 
Narayansami reminded Pol FSN that the, \"Pro-Hindu Bharatiya 
Janata Party at the center dislodged the Hindutva 
(nationalism) plank and faced the consequences.\"  END

SUBJECT: BLASTS ROCK HYDERABAD; EXTORTION NOT NAXALITE 
POLITICS TO BLAME 
 
1 (U) SUMMARY: A series of four bomb blasts in Hyderabad 
over the past several weeks appears to be the work of a 
small splinter group called the Communist Party of United 
States of India (CPUSI).  The explosions were all relatively 
small and seem to have been geared toward creating panic 
that might be exploited for the extortion of money from 
wealthy targets.  The People\'s War Maoist group, normal 
suspects in this type of incident in Andhra Pradesh, do not 
appear to have been involved in these incidents.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
FOUR BLASTS IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (U) The latest in a series of bomb blasts in Hyderabad 
was probably targeted at media mogul Ramoji Rao whose ETV 
network serves nearly one billion viewers in India and 
abroad.  Rao also owns \"Eenadu,\" India\'s largest circulation 
Telugu language daily with over one million readers.  The 
most recent blast occurred on November 4 near \"Kalanjali\" a 
popular handicraft showroom owned by Rao\'s family.  It was 
just the latest in a series of bomb explosions in the city. 
Two weeks earlier, an irrigation canal pipeline was blown up 
and last week, in separate incidents, explosions damaged two 
busses owned by private colleges in the city.  Gelignite 
residue was found at all of the bombsites. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
NOT THE USUAL SUSPECTS THIS TIME 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3. (U) When this type of action occurs in Andhra Pradesh, 
the usual suspects are the People\'s War group (PW) who 
recently announced their merger with another large Indian 
Maoist group, the Maoist Communist Center (MCC).  This time, 
though, it doesn\'t appear to be their work.  They are 
engaged in talks with the government of Andhra Pradesh and 
have announced a ceasefire during the talks. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
---- 
POLICE BELIEVE EXTORSION IS THE MOTIVE 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
----- 
4. (U) Hyderabad Police Commissioner R. P. Singh told Post 
that the explosions appear to be the work of a small 
splinter group that broke away from the Naxalites and call 
themselves the Communist Party of United States of India 
(CPUSI).  Singh said that police were \"90% sure\" that this 
same group was behind all four blasts.  Extortion seems to 
have been the motive.  The group apparently was using the 
attacks to spread panic in the city as a prelude to 
extorting money from wealthy targets like Rao, private 
colleges with deep pockets and others. 
 
------------------------ 
MORE TO COME? 
------------------------ 
 
5. (U) COMMENT:  Violence in Andhra Pradesh like this series 
of explosions has often been the work of Naxalite Maoists. 
This time, however, it appears to have been a prelude to an 
effort at extortion by a small group who broke away from the 
Naxalites.  Without quick apprehension of the suspects, more 
blasts seem likely.  END COMMENT

SUBJECT: VEERAPPAN\'S DEATH PUTS DHARMAPURI\'S FUTURE IN 
DOUBT 
 
REF: 03 CHENNAI 1422 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A seventeen-year manhunt ended with the 
shooting death of K.M. Veerappan, the famed forest 
brigand of Dharmapuri.  The shootout was the culmination 
of months of planning by the Government of Tamil Nadu 
(GoTN) and the police Special Task Force (STF).  The 
operation showcased the organizational capacity of the 
state police, but leaves questions about security in the 
region.  With Veerappan gone, the GoTN must integrate 
Dharmapuri into the rest of state or security concerns 
may persist.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
POLICE GUN DOWN BRIGAND AFTER 17-YEAR MANHUNT 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) After 17 years of futilely searching for the 
famed forest brigand, Veerappan, the Tamil Nadu police 
finally brought his banditry to an end.  Having 
infiltrated the Veerappan\'s gang, STF agents convinced 
the aging bandit to seek medical attention for an eye 
condition.  On October 18, the agents lured Veerappan 
into an ambulance, which took the brigand and three 
members of his gang to a prearranged location near 
Papparapatti, where 60 additional agents waited in 
hiding.  According to news reports, the STF agents used a 
loudspeaker to ask Veerappan to surrender.  He did not 
initially respond, and after repeated entreaties 
allegedly opened fire on the police.  The STF agents 
responded with heavy gunfire that killed the brigand and 
three accompl 
es.  The agent posing as the ambulace 
driver escaped unharmed. 
 
3. (SBU) The shooout brought an end to Veerappan\'s three- 
decade eign of crime in the dense Sathyamangalam forests 
of the Dharmapuri district of northern Tamil Nadu. Known 
for his uncanny knowledge of these forestareas, the 
brigand got his start as a teenager paching elephants. 
He later expanded into smuggling sandalwood, a material 
that fetches a high price in India due to its role in 
religious ceremonies.  In an effort to stave off capture, 
Veerappan allegedly killed at least 120 people, of whom 
many were forest and government officials.  He caught the 
nation\'s attention in 2000 when he captured Kannada film 
star Rajkumar and held him for 109 days, before releasing 
him under mysterious circumstances. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
VEERAPPAN\'S END A MAJOR VICTORY FOR CM AND TOP POLICEMAN 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
4. (U) For Tamil Nadu\'s chief minister, J. Jayalalithaa, 
bringing Veerappan\'s reign to a close was a significant 
political victory.  She rose to power in 2001 partly on 
the strength of her campaign promise to hunt down the 
brigand more effectively than the opposition party had. 
After three years of frustration, she took the 
opportunity to gloat over fulfilling her promise.  At a 
public meeting organized by the Federation of Indian 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the ASEAN 
Secretariat on October 20, she exulted in her success, 
 
SIPDIS 
calling Veerappan\'s death \"a dream come true.\"  She also 
lavished praise on the STF, granting a house site and 
$6,000 to 770 former and current agents.  In addition, 
she gave them one-step promotions in rank at a widely 
publicized public event. 
 
5. (SBU) The mission\'s success also vindicated STF 
Additional Director of Police, Vijay Kumar.  A no- 
nonsense approach that created trouble for him earlier in 
his career drew considerable praise from the media and 
politicians in the Veerappan incident.  Before receiving 
his current assignment, Vijay Kumar served as the Chennai 
City Police Commissioner from 2001 to 2003.  During this 
time, his \"shoot first, ask questions later\" approach 
cleaned up the city, but landed him in trouble, 
particularly when he shot Pannayar Venkatesan, a criminal 
with ties to the powerful Nadar community.  Vijay Kumar\'s 
failure to arrest five journalists from The Hindu 
(Reftel) led the Chief Minister to transfer him to the 
much less desirable STF posting. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
OPERATION REQUIRED MONTHS OF COORDINATION AND PLANNING 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6. (U) The success of \"Operation Cocoon\" also highlighted 
the intelligence and planning capabilities of the Tamil 
Nadu police.  Long considered among the most professional 
and most capable forces in India, the STF operation 
showed that the state police are now capable of sustained 
surveillance, intelligence, and infiltration campaigns. 
The shootout was the culmination of ten months of 
planning in coordination with several branches of the 
Tamil Nadu state government.  To counter the brigand\'s 
extensive intelligence network in nearby villages, the 
STF obtained licenses for agents to operate vans and 
taxis, in addition to installing agents in small shops 
and tea stands.  The intelligence gathered by these 
agents was crucial to coordinating the confrontation that 
led to Veerappan\'s death. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
FIRST INSTANCE OF INTERSTATE POLICE COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (SBU) In addition to demonstrating the organizational 
capacities of the Tamil Nadu state police, \"Operation 
Cocoon\" marked the first instance of prolonged and formal 
interstate police cooperation between Tamil Nadu and 
Karnataka.  The location of the Sathyamangalam forests on 
the border between the two states had long allowed 
Veerappan to evade local police by crossing the border. 
Regular meetings between the regional police chiefs from 
each state, interoperable communication sets, and 
operations by local police forces in their neighboring 
state tightened the net around the brigand, significantly 
limiting his movement.  According to Pitchandi, Secretary 
Public in the Government of Tamil Nadu, neither state had 
ever cooperated on such a significant law enforcement 
operation.  Venkatakrishnan, Director General - 
Intelligence for Tamil Nadu agreed, noting, \"There was a 
degree of interaction at the local level between the two 
states that did not exist in the past.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS QUESTION AGGRESSIVE POLICE TACTICS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
8. (SBU) While government and law enforcement officials 
celebrated Veerappan\'s death, human rights activists 
publicly questioned the STF\'s actions.  Noting that STF 
agents had sustained serious injuries in past encounters 
with Veerappan, human rights lawyers wondered how none 
were hurt in an allegedly intense shootout.  They also 
questioned the procedures followed in the postmortem 
examination.  The doctor conducted the exam with several 
police officers standing over him and hundreds more 
demanding access to the building.  Coupled with the 
initial plan by police to cremate the body (finally, he 
was buried) and refusal to allow examination of the 
ambulance, many activists doubted the claim that the 
police killed Veerappan in an \"encounter.\"  Many implied 
instead that he had been simply ambushed with no 
opportunity to surrender. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
VEERAPPAN\'S DEATH - A POWER VACUUM IN DHARMAPURI? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
9. (SBU) So complete was Veerappan\'s hold on the 
Sathyamangalam forests that his death leaves the future 
of the region in doubt.  Acknowledged to be one of the 
least developed districts in Tamil Nadu, Dharmapuri has 
been effectively unserved by the state government for 
many years.  Its poverty and remoteness make it an ideal 
breeding ground for discontent.  According to Pitchandi, 
\"The terrain is ideally suited for a Veerappan Junior.\" 
Veerappan reportedly had links to Tamil nationalist 
groups like the Tamil Nadu Liberation Army (TNLA) and the 
Tamil Nadu Retrieval Troops (TNRT), but K.P. Sunil, Vice 
President - News at Jaya TV, discounted any shared 
ideology.  He said that these groups have long been 
active in the area, due to their subtle links to the 
majority caste in the area, the Vanniars.  Veerappan was 
simply using these groups for weapons and support, and 
was not interested in furthering their cause.  Post 
sources believed increased support for Tamil nationalist 
groups would be unlikely, as the mainstream Pattali 
Makkal Katchi (PMK) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam 
(DMK) draw considerable support from Vanniar youth 
groups, leaving little room for the TNLA and TNRT. 
According to K. Chandru, a lawyer and human rights 
activist, \"Even if the Government of Tamil Nadu does 
nothing, the PMK and DMK will keep [the TNLA and TNRT] at 
bay.\" 
 
10. (SBU) Despite the brigand\'s link to the predominant 
caste in Dharmapuri, local political parties are not 
attempting to turn Veerappan into a hero.  According to 
Dr. Jeyaranjan, Director of the Institute of Development 
Alternatives, \"There is no attempt to iconize (sic) 
Veerappan.\"  Both the PMK and the DMK have refrained from 
condemning his killing, passing up the chance to turn his 
death into a political rallying point.  According to A.K. 
Moorthy, PMK Member of Parliament, Veerappan belonged to 
a very small subcaste within the Vanniar community, 
further dampening the political response to his death. 
 
11. (SBU) In addition to Tamil ultra groups, the People\'s 
War has also been active in Dharmapuri.  While this 
Maoist group has found success and support in Andhra 
Pradesh, the high urbanization of Tamil Nadu has limited 
the group\'s opportunities.  Dharmapuri\'s lack of 
infrastructure has allowed the People\'s War to gain a 
small foothold in the region.  However, according to 
Jeyaranjan, the People\'s War is not indigenous to 
Dharmapuri and does not have Veerappan\'s knowledge of the 
forests, limiting their activities to the plains. 
Jeyaranjan speculated that the STF would remain in 
Dharmapuri for at least a year, making expansion 
difficult for the People\'s War. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
GOTN RECOGIZES NEED FOR DEVELOPMENT, BUT PLANS VAGUE 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
12. (U) With Veerappan no longer terrorizing government 
and police officials in Dharmapuri, the way is clear for 
the GoTN to integrate Tamil Nadu\'s \"Wild West\" into the 
rest of the state.  According to Professor K. Nagaraj of 
the Madras Institute for Development Studies, \"The state 
government has invested heavily in the area,\" promoting 
mango cultivation and floriculture.  However, the forests 
remain isolated and cut off from the rest of the state\'s 
infrastructure.  The Chief Minister has talked of an 
integrated development plan, but her Home Secretary, 
Sheela Rani Chunkath, was not able to elaborate on the 
details of the plan.  \"No money has been allocated yet,\" 
she said. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
GOTN\'S TASK: DEVELOP REGION OR FACE NEW SECURITY THREATS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
13. (SBU) Comment: While Veerappan\'s death removed the 
main security threat in Dharmapuri, the conditions that 
spawned his power remain.  Its poverty, isolation, and 
lack of infrastructure leave the area ripe for further 
security threats.  The current contenders for power lack 
either knowledge of the local terrain or local political 
support, giving the GoTN time to bring this comparatively 
lawless region back into its reach.  However, if the 
Chief Minister fails to deliver the development she 
promises, the region could remain the \"Wild West\" of 
Tamil Nadu and pose future security concerns for the 
state.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NAXALITE CONSOLIDATION A CAUSE FOR WORRY 
 
REF: A) 03 Calcutta 516, B) Chennai 1244 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The merger of India\'s two largest 
and best organized Maoist groups, the Peoples\' War 
(PW) and Maoist Communist Center (MCC), into the 
Communist Party of India (Maoist) is likely to expand 
the horizon of their ambitions.  It will help these 
\"Naxalites\" knit together their areas of entrenchment 
in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, 
and Bihar right up to Nepal and work toward their goal 
of a \"Compact Revolutionary Zone.\"  The PW and MCC are 
believed to have at least 4,000 armed guerillas, and 
may have considerably more than that with some Indian 
think tanks putting the number of armed PW-MCC 
militants at 6,500 to 7,000.  They could become a 
serious threat to stability and prosperity at the sub- 
regional level.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
We Have Already Merged, Say Indian Ultra Leftists 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2.  (SBU) On October 14, Ramakrishna, State General 
Secretary of Andhra Pradesh\'s most successful Maoist 
 
SIPDIS 
group, Peoples War (PW), announced in Hyderabad that 
his organization had merged with the Maoist Communist 
Center (MCC), to create the Communist Party of India 
(Maoist), aka CPI (Maoist), and not to be confused 
with the CPI (Marxist) that currently governs in West 
Bengal and Tripura.  In 2003, the PW and MCCI had been 
added to the list of \"Other Terrorist Groups\" in the 
State Department\'s \"Patterns of Global Terrorism\" 
report.  According to Ramakrishna, the merger took 
place on September 21.  The Maoists thus appear to 
have thumbed their noses at the Indian intelligence 
officials who reportedly urged a meeting of Chief 
Ministers and officials of several Indian states on 
September 21, to prevent the long expected merger (Ref 
A).  Ramakrishna also announced that the military 
wings of these organizations - Peoples\' Guerrilla Army 
of PW and the Peoples\' Liberation Guerrilla Army of 
MCC - would merge in December and retain the latter 
name, PLGA. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
PW: The Deadliest Maoist Group In India 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) The PW has about 2,000 armed guerillas in 
different states of India, according to a senior 
intelligence officer of Andhra Pradesh (AP).  They 
have a formidable presence in 12 of AP\'s 23 districts, 
particularly in the \"Telengana\" areas and northern 
coastal districts, running parallel administrations in 
over a hundred villages.  In recent years, PW presence 
has spread to most other districts of AP.  According 
to AP sources, PW is also strong in several districts 
of Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Madhya 
Pradesh.  A GOI presentation made during a conference 
of Chief Ministers in Hyderabad suggested that as many 
as 125 of India\'s 602 districts may now be affected. 
Security think tanks report that PW possesses AK 
series rifles, LMGs, SLRs, carbines, .303s, grenades, 
revolvers, pistols and landmines.  Additionally, in 
2004 they used crude, inaccurate, three-stage rockets 
to attack police stations in the Guntur and Prakasam 
districts.  A technical squad manufactures 12-bore 
guns and ammunition, repairs all kinds of weapons and 
assembles grenades.  The newspaper The Hindu and two 
think tank organizations have reported that former 
LTTE militants have provided arms training to PW 
guerrillas, including training in claymore mine 
technology.  In October 2003, PW triggered nine 
claymore mines that nearly killed former AP Chief 
Minister Chandrababu Naidu, providing clear evidence 
of its lethal powers. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
MCC: Less Cohesive But With More External Links 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  (SBU) AP Intelligence sources believe that MCC has 
cadre and weapon strength almost equal to the PW, but 
that the ranks are less cohesive and disciplined.  The 
MCC is strongest in Bihar and Jharkhand with some 
presence in Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Chhattisgarh, 
Orissa, West Bengal and a few districts of 
Maharashtra.  The MCC is believed to have played a 
major role in uniting the major Maoist groups in India 
and Nepal.  Indian think tanks have reported increased 
cooperation between MCC and the Communist Party of 
Nepal (Maoist) since 1996, including joint training 
camps in India.  AP intelligence sources said that 
MCC\'s better connection with transnational channels is 
worrisome to Indian law enforcement agencies as it 
will now be available to the more effective PW as 
well. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Good-bye to Turf Wars: Consolidation Is In 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (SBU) The notoriously splintered Naxalites of 
India have been on a consolidation path since the late 
Nineties.  In 1998, the CPI (ML) Party Unity of Bihar, 
a major opponent of the MCC, merged with the PW, 
eventually reducing the infighting between various 
Naxalite groups in the region.  PW and MCC had been 
talking merger for a long time but discussions broke 
down in 1995 following internecine turf wars.  About 
2001, both sides announced a truce and started 
operational coordination leading to the recent merger. 
In the recently launched talks between the AP 
Government and the state\'s Maoists, another Naxalite 
organization, CPI (ML) Janashakthi, participated in 
coordination with PW leaders.  Thus, the recent 
mergers and coordination efforts have brought together 
four of India\'s largest and most well organized Maoist 
groups. 
 
6.  (SBU) In 2001, the MCC, Nepalese Maoists and PW 
formed a South Asia umbrella organization of ultra 
left groups, The Coordination Committee of Maoist 
Parties and Organizations of South Asia (CCOMPOSA). 
According to a CCOMPOSA press statement issued on July 
1, 2001, the nine founding members of the CCOMPOSA 
include the following three parties from Bangladesh: 
Vanga Purba Bangala Sarbahara Party (CC), Purba 
Bangala Sarbahara Party (Maoist Punargathan Kendra), 
Bangaladesh Samyabadi Party (ML); the following four 
parties from India: MCC, Peoples War, Revolutionary 
Communist Center of India (MLM), Revolutionary 
Communist Center of India (Maoist); one party from 
Nepal: Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist); and one 
party from Sri Lanka: Communist Party of Ceylon 
(Maoist).  The CCOMPOSA has had three international 
conferences so far, the latest of which was held March 
16-18, 2004, according to a press release published on 
the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) website on April 
10, 2004.  The release said that Kishore, a Maoist 
leader from Nepal, works as Convener of the CCOMPOSA. 
The political resolution of the third conference vowed 
to \"unite all the Maoist forces in the region ever 
more closely, build greater bonds of unity with the 
struggling forces of the region and turn the 
respective countries of South Asia into a strong 
bastion of world revolution,\" according to the press 
release. 
 
------------------------------ 
\"They Will Begin To Think Big\" 
------------------------------ 
 
7.  (SBU) AP Intelligence Deputy Inspector General 
Poornachandra Rao told Post that he worries that, 
after the merger, \"the Naxalites will now begin to 
think big, and thinking big is important.\"  According 
to Rao, a PW Naxalite hitherto holed up in a jungle in 
central Andhra Pradesh will now dream of a larger area 
under the militants that extends beyond the state or 
the country\'s boundaries.  For years, Indian security 
experts have been giving warnings of a larger leftist 
agenda to create a \"Compact Revolutionary Zone\" 
stretching across Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, 
Jharkhand, and Bihar to Nepal.  Rao does not regard 
the present strength of the \"armies\" of PW and MCC as 
a daunting force, but believes that it could grow. 
 
----------------------- 
Conflict On Caste Lines 
----------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Rao told Post that despite the merger 
conflicts between MCC and PW continue at the ground 
level.  He believes that one of the areas of conflict 
is the fact that the PW leadership, largely of upper 
caste Hindu background, rules over the lower 
caste/Dalit rank and file while in MCC, the leadership 
and rank and file are alike of lower caste background. 
Such tensions will probably to make coordinated 
activity more difficult, according to Rao.  In 
addition, some of the groups that are nominally part 
of the CPI (Maoist) may be reluctant to relinquish 
power at the local level and may continue acts of 
extortion outside of the organization\'s umbrella. 
 
---------------------- 
PW Is the Clear Winner 
---------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Rao also told post that in the new entity, 
CPI (Maoist), the PW leadership clearly retains the 
upper hand.  General Secretary of the PW, Ganapathy, 
remains General Secretary of CPI (Maoist).  Ganpathy 
(real name Muppala Lakshmana Rao) was born around 1950 
in the Karimnagar District of Andhra Pradesh.  He has 
been a hardcore leftist for over 35 years and has 
operated underground for 25 years, waging war on 
police, police-informants, political leaders and 
\"feudalists\".  In 1992, he took over the PW leadership 
ousting its founder Kondappalli Seetharamaiah. 
------------------- 
The Naxalite Agenda 
------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) The Naxalites reject parliamentary 
democracy and wage a protracted \"people\'s war\" to 
usher in a \"New Democratic Revolution\" that would 
establish \"People\'s Government.\"  To that end, they 
engage in guerrilla warfare, inspired by Maoist 
thought.  The successive stages of their declared 
program are to build \"bases\" in villages, form 
\"guerrilla zones\" on the way to declaring them as 
\"liberated zones,\" encircle towns and cities and seize 
political power.  Ramakrishna, the AP State Secretary 
of the former PW, told the press on October 12 that 
\"Using the Dandakaranya region (which covers 
continuous forest tracts in Maharashtra, AP, MP, 
Chattisgarh, and Orissa) as a lever, we will liberate 
the people of this country to establish people\'s 
rule.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (SBU) Although the Naxalites are numerically not 
strong enough to operate the prospective \"Compact 
Revolutionary Zone\" running across the contiguous 
jungles in several states, India\'s socially and 
economically disadvantaged millions could feed these 
insurrectionist forces.  Certainly the success of 
Nepal\'s Maoists in undermining the governance of that 
nation serves as an inspiration and a goal for India\'s 
CPI (Maoist).  Post notes that PMO internal security 
advisor MK Naryanan has described Naxalism as the 
single largest internal security threat to India.  The 
PW-MCC consolidation can only add to the threat. 
 
12.  (SBU) The Maoists have relentlessly attacked 
India\'s \"mainstream communist\" parties, CPI(M) and the 
CPI, for their \"capitulation to imperialism\" - meaning 
their market-friendly policies.  Already pressed by 
their own cadre and ideologues who do not have to cope 
with issues of governance in the real world, the 
CPI(M) and CPI will now have now to defend themselves 
from the increasingly articulate Maoists, too.  The 
mainstream leftist parties are likely to be now 
increasingly wary of market liberalization for fear of 
concerted attacks from the consolidating Naxalites. 
With 62 MPs in the national parliament, the CPI(M) and 
CPI have a major influence on GOI policies. 
 
13.  (SBU) The Naxalites are flourishing where there 
is a vacuum in state governance - primarily in remote 
tribal areas.  Given the intra-state reach of the CPI 
(Maoist) it appears that the GOI operates at a 
disadvantage in leaving it to the states to address 
them.  A successful strategy to combat the Naxalites 
must have two prongs:  one, the security aspect 
whereby police and paramilitary forces confront them 
directly; and two, the development aspect, whereby the 
state dries up their support and reasserts control 
through the provision of services to the people.  We 
do not believe that the CPI (Maoist) is likely to 
become an existential threat to the GOI at any time in 
the foreseeable future.  However, if governance issues 
are not addressed, there is a substantial possibility 
of the CPI (Maoist) becoming a more serious threat to 
stability and prosperity at the sub-regional level.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Tamil Nadu police arrested one of 
India\'s most prominent Hindu religious leaders, 
Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswathi of Kanchi, accused 
of murdering a former aide.  The arrest has shocked 
Tamil Nadu, but there is little public anger.  The 
move upset a miniscule group of the AIADMK\'s Brahmin 
supporters, but enhanced Jayalalithaa\'s image as a 
tough, fearless leader and silenced opponents who 
criticized her partiality to fellow upper caste 
Hindus.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
TAMIL NADU POLICE ARREST PROMINENT HINDU PONTIFF 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (U) On November 11, a special police team from 
Tamil Nadu arrested one of India\'s most prominent 
Hindu religious leaders, Shankaracharya Jayendra 
Saraswathi of Kanchipuram (aka Kanjivaram), for his 
alleged role in the murder of a former accountant. 
The police force flew to Mahaboobnagar, Andhra 
Pradesh, where Shankaracharya happened to be and 
arrested him without confrontation.  The following 
morning, they returned Shankaracharya to Chennai and 
produced him before the First Class Judicial 
Magistrate of Kanchipuram, the location of his Math 
(pronounced Mutt), his religious seat and headquarters 
for his religious organization.  He was remanded to 15 
days\' judicial custody and is currently lodged in 
Vellore prison, 90 miles west of Chennai. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
PONTIFF ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING TO MURDER FORMER AIDE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3. (SBU) The Superintendent of Police of the Cuddalore 
District told local media that the 70-year-old 
Shankaracharya played a \"significant role\" in the 
September 3 murder of Shankararaman, a former 
accountant for the Math.  According to a report in The 
Hindu, the police charged the Pontiff under the Indian 
Penal Code sections for conspiracy, murder and 
abetment.  Senior Chennai journalists told Post that 
Shankararaman had been publicly questioning perceived 
irregularities in the Math\'s accounts after he quit 
the job and joined a local Vaishnavite (i.e., 
competing) temple in Kanchipuram.  G.C. Shekhar, 
Principal Correspondent of the Hindustan Times, added, 
\"The police would have got clinching evidence of the 
Shankaracharya\'s involvement; otherwise [Tamil Nadu 
Chief Minister] Jayalalithaa would not have permitted 
the arrest.\"  State police have also allegedly found 
evidence of financial transactions between the Math 
and several men arrested in connection with 
Shankararaman\'s killing, in addition to a confession 
by one of the men linking the Pontiff to the murder. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
SHANKARACHARYA A LONGTIME SUPPORTER OF JAYALALITHAA 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4. (SBU) Although the AIADMK party is an offshoot of 
the rationalist DMK, its chief minister, Jayalalithaa 
is publicly a devout Hindu and devotee of the 
Kanchipuram Math.  In return, the Pontiff publicly 
supported Jayalalithaa during the controversy over her 
anti-conversion law.  They have also made several 
public appearances together at religious functions. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
DMK CONGRATULATES POLICE, STOPS PROTESTING CASE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (SBU) Rather than using the arrest to stir public 
ire, the opposition party DMK instead canceled a 
demonstration planned for November 13 protesting 
inaction on the murder case.  DMK President 
Karunanidhi congratulated the Tamil Nadu police for 
what he called an \"honest action.\"  A bitter opponent 
of the Brahmin-dominated Kanchipuram Math, the DMK 
leader has always kept true to the Dravidian political 
line, rallying lower castes and rationalists against 
the Math leadership. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
ARREST DOES NOT CAUSE LAW AND ORDER PROBLEMS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Despite Shankaracharya\'s prominent stature as 
a religious leader, his arrest of the Pontiff did not 
lead to public disturbances in Tamil Nadu. \"It is a 
shocking news, but only the Brahmin community will be 
angry,\" said a senior journalist, pointing out that 
the Brahmins are a tiny minority in the state. 
Government Secretary (Public Department) Pitchandi 
added, \"The community is shocked, [but] do not plan to 
react.  We do not apprehend any law and order 
situation developing on this arrest.\"  BJP Chennai 
District President Kumaravelu said, \"He is the 
patriarch of the Brahmin community, [so] the arrest 
will not evoke a response amongst a majority of 
Hindus.  I am sure there is considerable evidence of 
his involvement in the murder.\"  Sources told Post 
that some Brahmin organizations and possibly the state 
branch of the VHP are likely to organize 
demonstrations in the coming days, though did not 
expect violence. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
CM FURTHER STRENGTHENS HER HAND BEFORE ELECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT: Since her party\'s national assembly 
election debacle earlier in the year, Jayalalithaa has 
pursued a series of moves that have made the AIADMK a 
better potential coalition partner.  Following the 
rollback of fiscal reforms (Ref A), the inauguration 
of the Veeranam water project, and the killing of 
noted brigand Veerappan (Ref B), the arrest of the 
Kanchipuram Pontiff gives the chief minister another 
chance to improve her standing.  The DMK had accused 
Jayalalithaa of not actively pursuing Shankaracharya, 
which limits their ability to profit from his arrest. 
Support from a Brahmin community that traditionally 
supported her will weaken, but that will be offset by 
support from Tamil masses that do not revere the 
Kanchipuram Pontiff as much as their own caste and 
community leaders, film stars, or even politicians. 
Look for Jayalalithaa to pursue similar measures to 
consolidate power leading up to the 2006 elections.

SUBJECT: BJP\'S BID TO EXPLOIT PONTIFF\'S ARREST A FLOP IN 
TAMIL NADU 
 
REF: CHENNAI 1418 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Although the BJP and Viswa Hindu 
Parishad (VHP) shouted themselves hoarse about the arrest 
of Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswathi, their protests have 
fallen on deaf ears in Tamil Nadu.  A call for a bundh 
(strike) failed, no non-Brahmin parties joined the 
protests, and even Tamil Brahmins are not up in arms.  This 
poorly conceived maneuver is isolating the BJP from the 
local parties and is highlighting the lack of resonance in 
the South of BJP-style Hindutva.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
BJP BUNDH IN TN: FULL OF SOUND AND FURY, SIGNIFYING NOTHING 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Following the arrest of Shankaracharya Jayendra 
Saraswathi on November 11 for conspiracy to murder 
(reftel), the BJP and VHP organized a series of protests to 
capitalize on alleged public anger.  However, the 
demonstrations gained little to no traction in Tamil Nadu. 
The latest, a nationwide \"bundh\" or general strike, led to 
isolated incidents of stone throwing in Tamil Nadu, but 
otherwise failed to disrupt daily life.  Business in 
Chennai continued as usual. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
DMK QUESTIONS THE MOTIVES FOR THE ARREST 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU/NF) After an earlier intense campaign for the 
Shankaracharya\'s arrest, DMK President M.K. Karunanidhi has 
now attributed \"political and personal motives\" to the 
chief minister\'s decision to arrest the pontiff. 
Karunanidhi congratulated the police for their success and 
termed the arrest \"an honest act, he said, \"As far as 
Jayalalithaa is concerned, there is a background of 
vindictiveness.\"  According to G.C. Shekar (protect), a 
senior Chennai-based journalist, Karunanidhi may be 
receiving inside information on the investigation from the 
principal investigating officer, Superintendent of Police 
Shaktivelu.  \"Karunanidhi might have heard from 
(Shaktivelu) that the evidence linking the Shankaracharya 
to the murders is not firm.  So he might have wanted to 
have a political escape route for himself,\" Shekar 
speculated.  Other press reports hypothesized that 
Karunanidhi was attempting to back off from a cause that 
was directly benefiting his political rival. 
 
--------------------------------- 
OTHER LOCAL PARTIES KEEPING QUIET 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU/NF) Rather than using the Shankaracharya issue 
to further their own political agendas, the majority of the 
local parties in Tamil Nadu have remained silent about the 
arrest.  Neither the MDMK, the PMK, the Congress Party, nor 
the Dalit Panthers have spoken out against the arrest or 
joined the VHP\'s protests.  According to R.K. Radhakrishnan 
(protect), a senior correspondent for The Hindu, \"Except 
the Brahmins, nobody is bothered (by the arrest).\"  Less 
than 3% of Tamil Nadu\'s population is Brahmin, and the 
other parties do not readily take up Brahmin causes. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
TAMIL BRAHMINS UPSET, BUT NOT TAKING IT TO THE STREETS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5. (SBU/NF) Tamil Brahmins are shocked and upset by the 
Shankaracharya\'s arrest, but are not participating in great 
numbers in the BJP/VHP protests.  According to 
Radhakrishnan, the Brahmin community is instead \"engaged in 
their highest form of protest: writing letters to the 
editor of The Hindu.\"  More than anger at the arrest 
itself, the prevailing feeling amongst Tamil Brahmins seems 
to be resentment over the post-arrest treatment of the 
pontiff.  \"Ninety percent of the Brahmins feel the 
Shankaracharya should have been treated more respectfully 
by putting him up in a guest house instead of in jail,\" 
Shekar said. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
CM STICKS TO HER GUNS: \"I HAVE EVIDENCE OF HIS INVOLVEMENT\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa was not 
cowed by the BJP\'s threat of strikes and disturbances.  On 
November 17, she told the state assembly that she had 
\"shocking, firm evidence of (the Shankaracharya\'s) 
involvement\" in the murder.  \"Some may question the 
propriety of the arrest of an influential religious head. 
The government does not expect bouquets for arresting him, 
nor does it fear brickbats for not arresting him.  The 
government headed by me has taken the action under the 
principle that all are equal before the law,\" she added. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
AFTER BUNDH FAILURE, ADVANI SOFTENS BJP MESSAGE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
7. (SBU) Acknowledging the bundh\'s flop in Tamil Nadu, BJP 
President L.K. Advani warned the state government not to be 
misled by the people\'s silence.  He said that a large cross 
section was deeply anguished by the manner in which the 
Shankaracharya was arrested and treated.  However, he 
stopped short of attacking Jayalalithaa personally.  The 
police had asked the courts for an additional two days\' 
police custody of the Shakaracharya for further 
investigation.  However, the Kanchipuram court refused to 
extend the Shankaracharya\'s police custody, so that his 
status moved to that of judicial custody.  (The effect is 
to spare him further direct, \"private\" police 
interrogation.)  Advani used this ruling as an excuse to 
call off the bundh. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
FAILED PROTESTS ISOLATE BJP FROM DRAVIDIAN PARTIES 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8. (SBU) COMMENT: By organizing protests in Tamil Nadu, the 
BJP has pushed the local Dravidian parties away at a time 
when it should be courting them.  Instead of wooing either 
the AIADMK or DMK in anticipation of the 2006 state 
elections, the BJP is irritating both parties by trying to 
rouse sentiment where there is none.  In addition, the BJP 
seems unaware that it is viewed as a Brahmin party in a 
state that is 97% non-Brahmin.  Even the non-BJP political 
leaders who joined the protest, such as Sumbrahmanian Swamy 
(Janata Party) and former President Venkataraman, are 
widely regarded as elite Brahmin leaders.  Absent an 
external threat, Hindutva is a difficult sell in Tamil 
Nadu.  Unless threatened by a force inimical to all Hindus, 
Tamilians tend to identify themselves on caste or 
linguistic bases, and tend to view the BJP\'s message as 
Brahmanical and suspect.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: KARNATAKA GOVERNMENT IN LIMBO 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Bangalore, India\'s leading 
technopolis and the capital of Karnataka, is burdened 
with a tardy and incomplete state government led by 
contending coalition partners.  Local business leaders 
complain that the new Singh government has overshot 
the mark in shifting focus from urban to rural 
development and they have even threatened to move out 
expansion projects, but the Congress-JDS coalition 
government has not responded convincingly.  Chief 
Minister Dharam Singh\'s pliable politics, however, 
might permit the coalition to limp along longer than 
Bangalore business leaders would like.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
Karnataka Government in Limbo 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Nothing better epitomizes the current state 
of the Karnataka Government than its inability to 
build a full cabinet team.  Five months have passed 
since the Congress-Janata Dal-S (JDS) coalition 
government, the first of its kind in the state, came 
to power.  Chief Minister Dharam Singh has established 
and missed several deadlines for expanding the cabinet 
from its present strength of 12 ministers to the full 
strength of 34.  According to Bangalore journalists, 
the conflicts between Congress and JDS leaders as well 
as the infighting within the JDS have prevented Singh 
from accomplishing the task.  Important portfolios 
such as primary education, health, and IT have no 
political heads of their own.  \"Dharam Singh has to 
look after 24 portfolios, apart from coalition 
politics; how can you expect anything better?\" asked 
Ranganath, Editor of Bangalore\'s prominent daily, the 
Kannada Prabha. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
JDS - Congress Tension Delays Projects 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Deep divisions in the coalition have also 
thrown a monkey wrench into the works of several 
projects.  Business houses had expected the much- 
delayed Bangalore airport project at Devanahally to 
proceed faster than it has, given that the same party 
is in power at the Center and in the state.  \"We have 
a coalition government in the state, you know,\" Chief 
Executive Officer Albert Brunner of Bangalore 
International Airport explained to Post, \"The present 
Deputy Chief Minister (who belongs to the JDS) wants 
to reexamine the state support agreement the previous 
Congress government had finalized, and it takes much 
longer than we expected.\"  Brunner, however, was 
hopeful that the issue would be sorted out eventually, 
perhaps within a few days.  India Today correspondent 
Steven David was more pessimistic about the airport, 
citing whimsical, politically driven changes to the 
plan that carried significant additional financial 
costs. 
 
4. (SBU) The Bangalore-Mysore Infrastructure Corridor 
project of the previous government is also stuck, 
after JDS leader Deve Gowda charged the previous 
Congress Government with corruption.  Former Chief 
Minister SM Krishna reacted angrily with a letter to 
the Chief Minister asking him to scrap the project and 
return the acquired land to the farmers.  Krishna\'s 
pet private-public partnership to facilitate 
Bangalore\'s infrastructure development - the Bangalore 
Agenda Task Force - is another casualty of the change 
of government.  The project, though still alive on 
paper, remains completely non-functional. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Industry Captains Complain of Misplaced Priorities 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5. (SBU) During recent meetings in Bangalore conducted 
by visiting New Delhi PolCouns, politicians, 
journalists, and business leaders complained that the 
Singh government had overshot in shifting its focus 
from urban to rural development.  Several, including 
Infosys Chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy, assailed Chief 
Minister Singh for his lack of any vision for 
Karnataka\'s future.  As evidence of his misplaced 
priorities, several IT leaders cited the Chief 
Minister\'s failure to meet even once with the 
technology community.  The director of a top-tier US 
technology company remarked that unlike the past (when 
the office of Chief Minister Krishna was a stop on the 
itinerary of every visiting US executive) his CEO 
wouldn\'t even ask to call on Chief Minister Singh, 
preferring to go straight to the source in New Delhi, 
where the government is viewed as more responsive to 
industry concerns.  Releasing company results on July 
23, Azim Premji, Chairman of Wipro and India\'s richest 
man according to Forbes, threatened to relocate all 
expansion projects elsewhere if the city\'s 
infrastructure is not improved. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Dharam Singh Promises; Industry Skeptical 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Many Post contacts have expressed doubt that 
the Karnataka Chief Minister has the focus or dynamism 
to deliver on his promises.  Pressured by industry 
leaders, Chief Minister Dharam Singh has made some 
attempts to publicly recognize the importance of 
Bangalore\'s infrastructure, announcing on November 15, 
for instance, that the government would repair 900 km 
of road surface in Bangalore.  Consul General Haynes 
asked the Chief Minister on November 18 if the project 
had started and the Chief Minister said only \"We will 
assuredly do it.\"  On November 1, inaugurating 
Bangalore IT.Com, Dharam Singh announced a $90 million 
Hi-Tech City Project in Bangalore spread over 1070 
acres and said: \"We will leave no stone unturned to 
ensure that Bangalore maintains its pre-eminent 
position as an IT destination in India and the world.\" 
Karnataka IT Secretary Shankarlinge Gowda informed 
Post, however, that apart from an increase in the tax 
on computer hardware from 5% to 12%, nothing has 
changed in the new government\'s IT policy.  Industry 
remains skeptical of Dharam Singh\'s ability to deliver 
responsive administration. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Delhi: Yes to Bangalore, but Farmers Come First 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (U) On October 19, the Deccan Herald reported that 
Prime Minister Singh called Chief Minister Dharam 
Singh to urge him to repair the Bangalore city roads 
in response to complaints from the IT czars.  The 
Times of India reported on October 21 that several 
Bangalore industrialists raised the matter also with 
Rahul Gandhi, Sonia\'s son and an MP in his own right, 
when he toured the city. \"No new industries are coming 
to Bangalore...If investors drop Bangalore from their 
list, it will be India\'s loss,\" they reportedly told 
him, reminding him that the competition was not with 
any other Indian city but with China.  According to 
the newspaper, Rahul Gandhi\'s reply was: \"Indian 
politics is narrowly focused on issues and short-term 
gains.  Here, in Bangalore you are working on the 
latest of technologies while in my constituency 
(Amethi in UP) and other villages there are people who 
are living without water and electricity too.  I feel 
sad about this and have been grappling with this 
situation day in and day out.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Congress\' Partner Competing for Farmer Vote Bank 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
8. (SBU) The JDS is even more focused on the 
agriculture sector, a priority area the Congress would 
not like to leave exclusively to their coalition 
partner.  Talking to Consul General Haynes, Bangalore 
Deputy Chief Minister and JDS leader Siddaramaiah, who 
also handles the Finance portfolio said that one of 
the most important things the new government has done 
is to make available subsidized loans from cooperative 
societies to farmers at 6% interest in place of the 
12.5-13.5% interest charged previously.  He has also 
doubled the annual budgetary allocation for 
agriculture from its previous $100 million. 
Industries Minister and JDS leader P.G.R. Sindhia 
acknowledged to PolCouns that the state government has 
been slow to address Bangalore\'s yawning 
infrastructure gap and was \"still finding its feet.\" 
But he was unapologetic about the JDS focus on rural 
constituencies, arguing that this was an overdue 
corrective to former Chief Minister Krisna\'s urban 
preoccupation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Villagers Don\'t Care for IT, But Bangalore Helps All 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
9. (SBU) According to Ranganath, Karnataka citizens in 
general, particularly the ones outside Bangalore, are 
not excessively concerned over Bangalore\'s IT sector\'s 
concerns.  \"If they were a manufacturing industry, 
there would have been a little more support from the 
people,\" he observed.  However, he added that over a 
period of time, the government\'s incompetence on all 
fronts would affect the popularity of the government.\" 
Business sources, meanwhile, continue to point out 
that Bangalore provides about 60% of the state\'s GDP, 
and any shortfall in Bangalore would affect the entire 
state. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Pro-Farmer Policy Fig Leaf Can\'t Hide Inefficiency 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
10. (U) COMMENT: Interpreting the 2004 election 
results as a mandate to change from a pro-urban, IT 
driven development strategy, the present government 
seems to have found an excuse for being less active on 
the IT front despite loud protests from business 
leaders.  On paper, the new government\'s priorities 
are rural development and farmers\' welfare, areas that 
no government can ignore.  In reality, however, the 
leaders spend more time and energy on coalition 
politics, warring over spoils and settling old scores. 
To the new generation of Bangalore businessmen, at 
least, it is back to the old Congress politics of 
muddled thinking, lip service to the poor, and an 
increasingly irrelevant government.  But Dharam 
Singh\'s flexible politics may help to keep his 
government in power much longer than Bangalore\'s 
business community would like.  END COMMENT
