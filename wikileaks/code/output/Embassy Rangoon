1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.

2.  SUMMARY:  ON APRIL 24, BURMA\'S RULING MILITARY 
COUNCIL ISSUED ITS MOST DRAMATIC POLITICAL STATEMENT 
IN MORE THAN A YEAR.  IT PLEDGED TO RELEASE AN 
UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF POLITICAL DETAINEES \"PROMPTLY\", 
TO OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH OPPOSITION POLITICIANS WITHIN 
TWO MONTHS, AND TO CONVENE A \"NATIONAL CONVENTION\" SIX 
MONTHS LATER.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT BREAKS SIGNIFICANT NEW 
GROUND BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE EXISTENCE OF POLITICAL 
PRISONERS AND BY SETTING TIME FRAMES FOR INITIAL MOVES 
TOWARD CONSTITUTIONAL RULE.  COMING ONE DAY AFTER 
GENERAL THAN SHWE REPLACED SAW MAUNG AS HEAD OF STATE, 
IT REINFORCES EARLIER SPECULATION THAT THE FORMER 
LEADER MAY HAVE BEEN THE PRINCIPAL ROADBLOCK TO 
ADOPTION OF A MORE PRAGMATIC APPROACH ON POLITICAL AND 
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. 
 
3.  NEVERTHELESS, THE MILITARY RETAINS TIGHT CONTROL 
AND IS STILL FOLLOWING THE BASIC SCENARIO OUTLINED IN 
ITS DECLARATION 1/90, A COMPLEX MULTI-STAGED PROCESS 
UNLIKELY TO PRODUCE A CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT BEFORE 1994 
AT THE EARLIEST.  AS THE PLEDGE TO RELEASE POLITICAL 
DETAINEES CONTAINS A GAPING LOOPHOLE -- THE EXCLUSION 
OF THOSE WHO \"ENDANGER STATE SECURITY\" -- IT IS ALSO 
UNCLEAR WHETHER AUNG SAN SUU KYI OR ANY OTHER MAJOR 
OPPOSITION FIGURES WILL BE FREED.  STILL, IT IS A 
LONG-AWAITED STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND HAS BEEN 
GENERALLY WELL RECEIVED BY BURMESE OF ALL STRIPES.  WE 
THUS RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER ISSUING A 
CAREFULLY NUANCED STATEMENT CHARACTERIZING THE BURMESE 
ANNOUNCEMENT AS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT AND STRESSING 
THAT WE WILL BE WATCHING ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND 
BROADENING WITH KEEN INTEREST.  (SEE PARA 11.)  END 
SUMMARY. 
- 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT REVIVES BURMESE POLITICAL HOPES 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4.  ON APRIL 24, ONE DAY AFTER GENERAL THAN SHWE 
REPLACED SAW MAUNG AS CHIEF OF STATE (REF A), BURMA\'S 
RULING STATE LAW AND ORDER RESTORATION COUNCIL (SLORC) 
MADE A SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT.  IT PLEDGED: 
 
-- TO RELEASE AN UNSPECIFIED NUMBER OF POLITICAL 
DETAINEES \"PROMPTLY\"; 
 
-- TO OPEN A DIALOGUE WITH ELECTED PARLIAMENTARIANS 
AND THE REMAINING POLITICAL PARTIES WITHIN TWO MONTHS; 
AND 
 
-- TO CONVENE A \"NATIONAL CONVENTION\" SIX MONTHS 
LATER. 
 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT, SIGNED BY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF AND 
SLORC SECRETARY-1 KHIN NYUNT, HAD THE INSTANT EFFECT 
OF REVIVING POLITICAL HOPES AMONG THE BURMESE POPULACE 
AND RAISING EXPECTATIONS THAT MOVEMENT TOWARD A 
CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY IN THE REALM OF THE 
POSSIBLE. 
 
5.  OUR OWN INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND THAT OF SEVERAL 
SOLID BURMESE SOURCES IS THAT THIS REPRESENTS A 
SIGNIFICANT BREAK WITH THE PAST.  THE MOST STRIKING 
ASPECT OF THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT IS ITS 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT BURMA HAS DETAINED PEOPLE FOR 
POLITICAL REASONS, A 180-DEGREE REVERSAL FROM PREVIOUS 
ASSERTIONS THAT ALL DETAINEES HAD \"VIOLATED EXISTING 
LAW.\"  HOWEVER, HOW THE GOB WILL IMPLEMENT ITS 
COMMITMENT TO RELEASE THESE PEOPLE REMAINS AN OPEN 
QUESTION:  THE ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS A LOOPHOLE IN 
EXCLUDING THOSE WHO \"ENDANGER STATE SECURITY\" AND DOES 
NOT MAKE IT CLEAR WHETHER THE RELEASES WILL INCLUDE 
PERSONS ALREADY CONVICTED OF \"CRIMINAL\" OFFENSES -- AS 
OPPOSED TO THOSE MERELY \"ARRESTED AND DETAINED\" FOR 
POLITICAL REASONS. 
 
6.  IN AN OPTIMISTIC VEIN, ONE FORMER POLITICIAN 
SPECULATED TO US THAT THE \"SECURITY\" EXCLUSION IS 
LARGELY A FACE-SAVING PHRASE AND THAT UP TO 90 PERCENT 
OF POLITICAL PRISONERS COULD BE ON THE STREETS 
SHORTLY.  HOWEVER, A MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS ASSESSMENT WAS 
PROVIDED BY TWO SEASONED BURMESE JOURNALISTS (PROTECT) 
WHO DO NOT EXPECT THE IMMINENT RELEASE OF AUNG SAN SUU 
KYI OR ANY OTHER ACTIVE OPPOSITION FIGURES LIKE NLD 
LEADERS KYI MAUNG AND FORMER GENERAL TIN 00.  MOST 
SOURCES AGREE THAT THE AUTHORITIES WILL PROBABLY LIFT 
THE HOUSE ARREST OF U NU, SINCE THE ELDERLY AND 
ENFEEBLED FORMER PRIME MINISTER HAS NOT BEEN CONVICTED 
OF ANY CRIME AND HARDLY REPRESENTS A SECURITY THREAT 
AT THIS POINT. 
 
------------------------------------- 
POLITICAL \"DIALOGUE\" FINALLY IN SIGHT 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  THE COMMITMENTS TO MEET WITH POLITICAL LEADERS AND 
TO CONVENE A NATIONAL CONVENTION ARE NOT NEW, AND MUST 
BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SLORC\'S \"DECLARATION 
1/90\" -- A CONVOLUTED ROADMAP FOR EFFECTIVELY NEGATING 
THE RESULTS OF THE 1990 ELECTIONS.  ACCORDING TO THAT 
DECLARATION, THE SOLE FUNCTION OF THE NATIONAL 
CONVENTION WILL BE TO DRAFT A CONSTITUTION WHICH WILL 
STILL BE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY SLORC AND POSSIBLY A 
NATIONAL REFERENDUM.  ONLY AFTER ADOPTION OF THE 
CONSTITUTION WOULD NEW ELECTIONS BE HELD AND POWER 
TRANSFERRED TO A (LIKELY COSMETIC) CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
8.  NEVERTHELESS, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE GOB HAS 
PROVIDED ANY TIME FRAME FOR EVEN THESE INITIAL STEPS 
TOWARD DRAFTING A CONSTITUTION.  IN FACT, FORMER 
CHIEF OF STATE SAW MAUNG EXPLICITLY TOLD OUR CHARGE IN 
JANUARY THAT THERE IS \"NO TIME FRAME\" FOR MOVES TOWARD 
CONSTITUTIONAL RULE.  INTELLIGENCE CHIEF KHIN NYUNT 
AND OTHERS HAD ALSO INDICATED EARLIER THAT THE 
POLITICAL PARTIES THEMSELVES WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TAKE 
THE INITIATIVE FOR CONVENING A NATIONAL CONVENTION -- 
AN INVITATION TO \"SUICIDE\" GIVEN THE GOB PENCHANT FOR 
PICKING OFF THOSE WHO SHOW POLITICAL INITIATIVE.  NOW, 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLEDGED TO START TALKS WITHIN TWO 
MONTHS WITH THE LEADERS OF THE \"POLITICAL PARTIES 
EXISTING LAWFULLY\" AND \"INDIVIDUAL\" MP\'S.  HOW THEY 
WILL IMPLEMENT THIS AND WHETHER POLITICIANS WILL BE 
FREE TO TAKE INDEPENDENT POSITIONS REMAINS TO BE 
SEEN. 
 
-------------------------------- 
BUT PARTICIPATION MAY BE LIMITED 
-------------------------------- 
 
9.  BASED ON THE NEW LEADERSHIP\'S STATEMENT, THE GOB NOW 
APPEARS WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH SOME BUT NOT ALL OF 
THOSE ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT IN THE MAY 1990 
ELECTIONS:  ACCORDING TO THE LATEST OFFICIAL 
ANNOUNCEMENTS, 98 OF THE 485 ELECTED MP\'S HAVE EITHER 
BEEN DISQUALIFIED (68), RESIGNED (12), OR DIED (8) 
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.  AN ADDITIONAL 20 OR SO ARE 
BELIEVED TO BE IN DETENTION, EITHER CONVICTED OR 
AWAITING TRIAL BUT NOT YET FORMALLY DEREGISTERED BY 
THE ELECTIONS COMMISSION.  OF THE ORIGINAL 235 PARTIES 
FORMED IN 1989 AND THE 93 THAT CONTESTED THE 1990 
ELECTIONS, ONLY TEN REMAIN LEGAL.  AMONG THESE ARE THE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY (NLD), THE SHAN NLD, AND 
THE PROGOVERNMENT NATIONAL UNITY PARTY, WHICH TOGETHER 
ACCOUNTED FOR 423 OF THE ORIGINAL PARLIAMENTARIANS. 
THE GOVERNMENT\'S REFERENCE TO \"INDIVIDUAL\" MPS 
APPARENTLY INCLUDES TWO GROUPS:  THOSE ELECTED FROM 
PARTIES WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN ABOLISHED, AND A HANDFUL 
OF NLD MPS WHO HAVE EITHER RESIGNED OR BEEN EXPELLED 
FROM THE PARTY. 
-------------------------- 
COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION 
-------------------------- 
 
10.  THOUGH THERE ARE MANY UNCERTAINTIES AND CAVEATS 
IN THE SLORC\'S SHORT STATEMENT, IT SEEMINGLY 
REPRESENTS THE FIRST PROMISE OF A BREAK-UP OF BURMA\'S 
POLITICAL LOGJAM.  WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE ON THE 
FACTORS LEADING UP TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BUT IT NOW 
APPEARS SAW MAUNG -- DESPITE HIS LACK OF DAY-TO-DAY 
MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS 
-- MAY HAVE BEEN THE KEY IMPEDIMENT TO ANY POLITICAL 
OPENING.  WHATEVER THE CASE, HIS DEPARTURE HAS 
PROVIDED A CONVENIENT EXCUSE FOR THAN SHWE, PRESUMABLY 
ACTING ON THE ADVICE OF KHIN NYUNT (AND POSSIBLY NE 
WIN) TO MOVE FORWARD -- AT LEAST ON PAPER.  WHILE 
DOMESTIC CONSIDERATIONS WERE PROBABLY KEY, WE ALSO 
ASSUME THAT MOUNTING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE -- 
INCLUDING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND 
SOME QUIET ENCOURAGEMENT FROM CHINA -- MAY HAVE PUSHED 
THE MILITARY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
 
11.  WHILE ANY U.S. REACTION SHOULD UNDERSCORE THE 
NEED FOR DEEDS RATHER THAN MERE WORDS, EMBASSY 
BELIEVES IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR DEPARTMENT TO 
NOTE THE LATEST GOB COMMITMENTS AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD 
GREATER RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL 
RULE.  ALONG THESE LINES, A NUANCED STATEMENT SHOULD 
STRESS THAT WE WILL BE OBSERVING THE IMPLEMENTATION 
(AND BROADENING) OF THIS PROGRAM WITH GREAT INTEREST.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  DURING A RECENT LENGTHY TALK WITH CHARGE, A 
LEADING THAI BUSINESSMAN WITH OVER 100 FISHING BOATS 
PLYING BURMESE WATERS PROVIDED CHAPTER AND VERSE ON 
CORRUPTION AMONG RANGOON\'S RULING GENERALS.  ADMITTING 
THAT HE PERSONALLY MULES IN ABOUT 50,000 DOLLARS IN 
CASH DURING WEEKLY TRIPS TO BURMA, THE ENTREPRENEUR 
SAID THAT PERHAPS 15 PERCENT OF THIS MONEY WAS 
EARMARKED FOR PAYOFFS TO SENIOR GENERALS.  (THE 
REMAINDER GOES TO THE GOB FOR FISHING RIGHTS.) 
 
3.  DILATING ON WHO GETS WHAT, THE THAI BUSINESSMAN 
NOTED THAT FORMER MINISTER FOR FISHERIES LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL CHIT SWE HAD LONG BEEN THE \"PRIME RECIPIENT\". 
\"TAUGHT BY THE THAI\", HE SAID, \"THE MINISTER HAS AN 
EXQUISITE SENSE AS TO HOW TO RECEIVE A BRIBE AND YET 
PRESERVE SOME DEGREE OF DENIABILITY.\"  ACCORDINGLY, 
CHIT SWE DECLINES ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS WITH THAI 
BUSINESSMEN, INSISTING THAT ALL DISCREET DEALINGS BE 
WITH HIS SON WHO ALSO ESCORTS DEPARTING ENTREPRENEURS 
THROUGH CUSTOMS WITHOUT THE USUAL CHECKS AS PART OF 
THE FAMILY\'S SERVICES.  COMMENT:  MOST RECENTLY, CHIT 
SWE\'S SON CAME TO THE AIRPORT ON 20 MINUTES NOTICE TO 
SQUIRE A GROUP OF SOME 60 THAI ENTREPRENEURS THROUGH 
CUSTOMS. 
 
4.  AS FOR OTHER DEALINGS WITH MEMBERS OF THE RULING 
STATE LAW AND ORDER RESTORATION COUNCIL (SLORC), THE 
BUSINESSMAN OBSERVED THAT ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TIN 00 
WAS ALSO A RECIPIENT OF DIVERSE GRATUITIES.  HOWEVER, 
MAJOR GENERAL TIN 00 HAD A REPUTATION FOR 
\"RENEGOTIATING DEALS AND OTHERWISE BEING DIFFICULT\". 
MOREOVER, EVER SINCE HIS TEENAGE SON HAD RECEIVED A 
MERCEDES BENZ FOR BROKERING ONE DEAL AND TAKEN TO 
DRIVING IT AROUND TOWN, TIN 00 HAS BEEN UNDER CLOSE 
SCRUTINY BY THE BURMESE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE (DDSI) 
WHOSE AGENTS CONDUCT SPOT CHECKS ON HIS RESIDENCE. 
COMMENT:  ACCORDING TO THIS BUSINESSMAN AND ANOTHER 
SOURCE, INTELLIGENCE CHIEF KHIN NYUNT FORCED TIN 00 TO 
TURN THE MERCEDES BENZ OVER TO THE GOB. 
 
5.  WHILE HIS OWN BUSINESS DEALINGS DO NOT INVOLVE ANY 
OF THE JUNTA\'S TRUE HEAVYWEIGHTS, THE THAI 
ENTREPRENEUR NOTED THAT SEVERAL OF HIS PEERS HAVE HAD 
DEALINGS WITH KHIN NYUNT\'S WIFE -- WHO HAS A FONDNESS 
FOR EXPENSIVE JEWELRY -- AND WITH THE SON OF NEW HEAD 
OF STATE THAN SHWE.  IN BOTH INSTANCES, GRATUITIES 
HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN LIMITED TO COMPARATIVELY MODEST 
GIFTS AS A REWARD FOR INFLUENCE PEDDLING.  DESPITE 
THAN SHWE\'S APRIL 23 PROMOTION, THE BUSINESSMAN 
DOUBTED THAT BURMA\'S NEW LEADER WOULD \"ENRICH HIMSELF 
UNDULY ON THE JOB\" OR \"ALLOW CORRUPTION BY OTHER 
GENERALS TO INCREASE\".  IN THIS REGARD, THE 
BUSINESSMAN OBSERVED THAT GENERAL THAN SHWE LIVED 
AUSTERELY EVEN BY BURMESE STANDARDS AND HAD LITTLE USE 
FOR SUCH WESTERN LUXURIES AS AIR CONDITIONING.

REF:  RANGOON 2558 (NOTAL) 
 
1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  ON MAY 6-7, TWO SOURCES WITH UNUSUALLY GOOD 
ACCESS TO BURMA\'S MILITARY LEADERSHIP PROVIDED CHARGE 
WITH A TOUR D\'HORIZON ON RECENT POLITICAL 
DEVELOPMENTS HERE.  BOTH CONFIRMED OUR INITIAL 
ASSESSMENT OF BURMA\'S APRIL 23 \"PALACE COUP\" WHEREIN 
FORMER HEAD OF STATE AND ARMED FORCES COMMANDER SAW 
MAUNG CEDED PLACE TO GENERAL THAN SHWE WHILE 
INTELLIGENCE KHIN NYUNT REMAINED \"DE FACTO PRIME 
MINISTER\" AND BEARER OF NE WIN\'S EPISODIC POLICY 
SUGGESTIONS (REFTEL).  CONCURRING THAT SAW MAUNG WAS 
GONE FOREVER DESPITE FACESAVING OFFICIAL RHETORIC TO 
THE CONTRARY, THEY NOTED THAT HIS SECURITY 
DETACHMENTS (ABOUT 1300 SOLDIERS IN ALL) HAD BEEN 
TRANSFERRED WITHIN 24 HOURS.  AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER 
HAVE ALSO BEEN DETAINED FOR QUESTIONING BY MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE (DDSI).  ADDITIONALLY, THE DDSI IS 
CLOSELY MONITORING ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TIN 00 AND 
SEVERAL OTHER SENIOR MILITARY WHO HAD ARGUED FOR 
KEEPING SAW MAUNG IN POWER DURING SEVERAL MID-APRIL 
SLORC STRATEGY SESSIONS. 
 
3.  ONE SOURCE, A LONGTIME NE WIN CONFIDANTE, SAID 
THAT SAW MAUNG\'S RETIREMENT, WHILE PRECIPITATED BY A 
SHARP DECLINE IN HIS HEALTH IN EARLY APRIL, HAD 
ACTUALLY BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. 
IMPARTING MESSAGES VIA KHIN NYUNT, NE WIN HAD AT 
LEAST TWICE PUT OUT THE WORD THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THE 
AILING SENIOR GENERAL TO CONSIDER STEPPING DOWN. 
COMMENT:  THIS TRACKS WITH EARLIER AARO/RANGOON 
REPORTING AND OTHER EMBASSY INTELLIGENCE.  HOWEVER, 
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE INITIAL IMPETUS CAME FROM 
NE WIN OR FROM THAN SHWE/KHIN NYUNT WHO HAD EARLIER 
PUSHED SAW MAUNG UNSUCCESSFULLY TO INITIATE SOME 
POLITICAL/ECONOMIC REFORMS.  IN THIS REGARD, OUR 
OTHER SOURCE -- THE ONLY FOREIGNER GENUINELY CLOSE TO 
THE JUNTA -- ALLOWED THAT IT WAS DISTINCTLY POSSIBLE 
THAT KHIN NYUNT HAD PRESENTED NE WIN WITH REASONS FOR 
LEVERING SAW MAUNG OUT OF POWER.  THESE MAY THEN HAVE 
BEEN PLAYED BACK, WITH NE WIN\'S IMPRIMATUR, TO THE 
COLLECTIVE SLORC IN MID-APRIL. 
 
4.  ONE INFORMANT NOTED THAT WHILE THE SLORC HAD 
COLLECTIVELY AGREED THAT SAW MAUNG SHOULD STEP DOWN, 
THE FINAL PUSH CAME VIA A FOLLOW-UP LETTER FROM NE 
WIN.  QUOTING SAW MAUNG\'S SON AND STAFF AIDE AS HIS 
SOURCES, OUR INTERLOCUTOR SAID THE LETTER HAD BEEN 
HAND DELIVERED BY A \"WEEPY\" KHIN NYUNT.  REACTING 
ANGRILY -- \"NE WIN COULD HAVE TOLD ME PERSONALLY\" -- 
SAW MAUNG THEN DESPATCHED HIS SON TO NE WIN\'S 
RESIDENCE WITH A RECLAMA, WHICH PROVED UNSUCCESSFUL. 
THEREAFTER, SAW MAUNG WAS UNDER HEAVY SEDATION MIXED 
WITH PULLS FROM THE BOTTLE, AND ALL BUT INERT ON 
APRIL 23. 
 
5.  LOOKING AHEAD, BOTH SOURCES SAID THAT THE NEW 
REGIME\'S RECENT POSITIVE STEPS DID NOT PRESAGE A 
WHOLESALE LIBERALIZATION OF BURMA.  THE MILITARY 
MIND-SET THAT PERCEIVES THE ARMY AS \"INDISPENSIBLE TO 
A BELEAGUERED, FRAGILE NATION\" IS STILL THERE.  THAT 
SAID, THEY EXPECTED AT LEAST HALTING PROGRESS TOWARDS 
A COSMETIC DEMOCRACY AND TRUE ECONOMIC REFORM.  TO 
THESE ENDS, SENIOR REGIONAL COMMANDERS ARE TO BE 
CALLED IN WITHIN A WEEK OR SO TO DISCUSS BANKING 
LIBERALIZATION, CURRENCY RATE READJUSTMENT AND WAYS 
TO BUILD ON THE RECENT GOB CEASE-FIRE VIS-A-VIS THE 
KAREN INSURGENTS. 
 
6.  AS FOR THE STABILITY OF BURMA\'S REVISED MILITARY 
LEADERSHIP, NEITHER FORESAW AN/ SPECIFIC IMPENDING 
PROBLEMS.  THAN SHWE, THOUGH NOT PARTICULARLY CLOSE 
TO THE OLDER MEMBERS OF THE SLORC, ENJOYS GENERALLY 
GOOD TIES WITH THE KEY UPCOUNTRY COMMANDERS AND 
ACCEPTABLE WORKING RELATIONS WITH KHIN NYUNT AND 
OTHER MAJOR PLAYERS IN RANGOON.  ALSO, LEST THE 
WATERS BE UNDULY ROILED (AND TO CONCENTRATE HIS OWN 
POWER), THE NEW HEAD OF STATE PLANS FOR NOW TO LEAVE 
THE DEPUTY ARMED FORCES COMMANDER AND ARMY CINC 
POSITIONS VACANT.  COMMENT:  WE HAVE ALSO HEARD 
INDICATIONS THAT THAN SHWE HAS ABOLISHED OR WILL SOON 
ABOLISH THESE POSITIONS.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S LEADER EXUDES CONFIDENCE -- AND A 
         SOFTER LINE 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  THE INDIAN AMBASSADOR TOLD CHARGE TODAY THAT HIS 
FAREWELL MEETING WITH GENERAL THAN SHWE ON SEPTEMBER 
17 HAD REINFORCED HIS SENSE THAT RANGOON\'S NEW HEAD 
OF STATE IS SOMEWHAT SERIOUS ABOUT LIBERALIZING BURMA 
-- AND ENCOUNTERING RESISTENCE ON THIS SCORE FROM 
POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE CHIEF KHIN NYUNT.  ELABORATING, 
HE CHARACTERIZED THAN SHWE AS \"ASSIDUOUSLY PEDDLING A 
SOFTER LINE\" BOTH RE INDIAN-BURMESE RELATIONS AND 
INTERNAL POLITICAL EVOLUTION.  THE GENERAL ADMITTED, 
FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE MILITARY \"CANNOT STAY IN POWER 
TOO LONG WITHOUT RISKING UNPOPULARITY\" AND THAT 
BURMA\'S \"POOR ECONOMY WON\'T RECOVER WITHOUT FOREIGN 
EXPERTISE AND INPUTS.\"  THAN SHWE ALSO VENTURED THAT 
THE \"FRACTIONING (SIC: FRAGMENTATION) OF BURMA CAN 
ONLY BE AVOIDED IF THE PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT IN AND CAN 
SHARE IN THE CAKE.\" 
 
3.  WHILE GENERAL THAN SHWE INTERLARDED THESE 
ADMISSIONS WITH MORE CONVENTIONAL GOB RHETORIC ON THE 
MILITARY\'S CONTINUING ROLE IN KEEPING THE COUNTRY 
TOGETHER, HIS \"LIBERAL\" ADMISSIONS WENT WELL BEYOND 
THE NORM -- EVEN FOR PRIVATE TALKS.  STRONGMAN KHIN 
NYUNT -- WHO SAT IN BUT WAS STUDIOUSLY KEPT OUT OF 
THE DISCOURSE BY THAN SHWE -- WAS CLEARLY 
DISCOMFORTED BY ALL THIS CANDOR.  AT ONE POINT, THE 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF EVEN VIGOROUSLY NODDED HIS HEAD IN 
DISAGREEMENT.  COMMENT:  DURING THAN SHWE\'S TALK WITH 
THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR SOME MONTHS BACK, THE 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF TWICE BROKE IN TO DISAGREE WITH 
HIS BOSS. 
 
4.  DURING THE DISCUSSION OF INDIAN-BURMESE 
RELATIONS, THAN SHWE CHARACTERIZED TIES AS \"ON THE 
IMPROVE\" BUT THEN FAULTED NEW DELHI FOR SOURING THE 
RELATIONSHIP IN THE FIRST PLACE, CHIEFLY BY ALLOWING 
ALL INDIA RADIO TO RUN AMOK.  HOWEVER, HE CAREFULLY 
BALANCED THIS \"HISTORICAL\" CRITICISM BY OBSERVING 
THAT THE RECENT VISIT TO INDIA BY DEPUTY FOREIGN 
MINISTER AND REGIME INSIDER U AYE HAD GONE VERY 
WELL.  LOOKING AHEAD, THAN SHWE HOPED THAT HIS 
FOREIGN MINISTER WOULD SOON GET AN INVITATION TO NEW 
DELHI.  THE INDIAN AMBASSADOR RESPONDED BY NOTING 
THAT FURTHER POLITICAL PROGRESS IN BURMA WOULD EASE 
THE WAY FOR HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGES. 
 
5.  TURNING TO THE PRC-BURMA NEXUS, THE INDIAN 
AMBASSADOR VOICED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S CONCERN THAT CHINA 
MAY BE ALLOWED TO BUILD A NAVAL BASE ON THE ANDAMAN 
SEA COAST (SEPTEL HAS DETAILS).  THAN SHWE BRUSHED 
AWAY THIS FEAR, NOTING THAT \"BURMA LACKS THE MONEY 
FOR ANY JOINT BUILDING OF A NAVAL BASE\" AND 
\"CERTAINLY WON\'T ALLOW CHINA OR ANY FOREIGN POWER TO 
HAVE A BASE HERE.\"  WHEN THE INDIAN AMBASSADOR 
PURSUED PRC-BURMESE TIES FURTHER BY ASKING ABOUT THE 
ARMS RELATIONSHIP, THE HEAD OF STATE OBSERVED THAT 
\"HIS COUNTRY HAD FEW ALTERNATIVES.\"  CLOSING THE 
SUBJECT, HE TOLD THE INDIAN AMBASSADOR NOT TO WORRY 
AS \"BURMA IS ADEQUATELY CONCERNED ABOUT SOVERIGNTY 
ISSUES.\"  COMMENT:  A WORLD-CLASS UNDERSTATEMENT. 
 
6.  GENERAL COMMENT:  THAN SHWE CONTINUES TO IMPRESS 
US AS MORE INTERESTED IN PURSUING A LIBERAL COURSE 
THAN EITHER HIS PREDECESSOR SAW MAUNG OR KHIN NYUNT, 
AT LEAST BY BURMESE MILITARY STANDARDS.  (A VIEW 
SHARED BY OTHER WESTERN EMBASSIES HERE.)  THOUGH THIS 
HAS NOT LED TO AN OPEN SPLIT BETWEEN BURMA\'S TWO TOP 
GUNS -- IN PART BECAUSE THE RULING GENERALS PERCEIVE 
A STRONG NEED FOR A UNITED PUBLIC FRONT -- THERE ARE 
QUASI-OVERT SIGNS OF FRICTION.  FOR EXAMPLE, KHIN 
NYUNT RECENTLY TOOK THE UNUSUAL STEP OF COMPLAINING 
TO THE THAI AMBASSADOR ABOUT THE GOB\'S (READ THAN 
SHWE\'S) ADMISSION TO HOLDING POLITICAL PRISONERS. 
THIS ACTION, THE STRONGMAN CLAIMED, WAS CLEARED BY 
NEITHER MOFA NOR HIMSELF.

REGIONAL COMMANDER MAUNG AYE SLATED TO FILL THE 
JUNTA\'S NOMINAL NUMBER TWO POSITION.  INTELLIGENCE 
CHIEF KHIN NYUNT WILL GET A SOMEWHAT FANCIER TITLE AND 
WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO CALL MOST OF THE SHOTS.  IN 
OTHER ARMED FORCES DAY DEVELOPMENTS, THOUGH CHIEF OF 
STATE THAN SHWE\'S SPEECH WAS LESS STRIDENT THAN 
SIMILAR MESSAGES BY HIS PREDECESSOR, IT GAVE NO HINT 
OF COMPROMISE ON THE MILITARY\'S DEMAND FOR A LEADING 
ROLE IN BURMA\'S FUTURE POLITICAL SYSTEM.  IN KEEPING

2. (U)  CAREFUL OBSERVERS OF THE BURMESE OFFICIAL 
MEDIA LEARNED THIS WEEK THAT A NUMBER OF TOP MILITARY 
OFFICERS WERE PROMOTED ON THE MARCH 27 ARMED FORCES 
DAY HOLIDAY (REFS A AND B).  NONE OF THE CHANGES WAS 
SPECIFICALLY ANNOUNCED, BUT REPORTS ON THE ARMED 
FORCES DAY CEREMONIES INCLUDE NEW TITLES WHICH CONFIRM 
THAT AT LEAST TWELVE MAJOR GENERALS WERE ELEVATED TO 
THE THREE-STAR LIEUTENANT GENERAL RANK.  AMONG THOSE 
PROMOTED WERE THE FOLLOWING SEVEN SLORC MEMBERS, ALL 
OF WHOM HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL 
MONTHS FROM POSITIONS AS REGIONAL MILITARY COMMANDERS 
TO TOP JOBS IN GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES: 
 
-- MINISTER FOR DEVELOPMENT OF BORDER AREAS AND 
NATIONAL RACES MAUNG THINT (FORMERLY NORTHEAST 
REGIONAL COMMANDER); 
 
-- MINISTER OF LABOR AYE THOUNG (FORMERLY SOUTHERN 
COMMANDER) ; 
 
-- MINISTER OF MINES KYAW MIN (NORTHWESTERN COMMAND); 
 
-- MINISTER OF HOTELS AND TOURISM KYAW BA (NORTHERN 
COMMAND) ; 
 
-- MINISTER OF TRADE TUN KYI (CENTRAL COMMAND); 
 
-- MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND DEFENSE SERVICES 
ADJUTANT GENERAL MYINT AUNG (SOUTHEASTERN COMMAND); 
AND 
 
-- MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS MYA THINN (WESTERN 
COMMAND) . 
 
RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS MINISTER MYO NYUNT WAS ALSO PROMOTED 
FROM MAJOR GENERAL TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL, THOUGH HE 
RETAINS HIS POST AS RANGOON REGIONAL COMMANDER FOR THE 
TIME BEING. 
 
3. (C) FOUR OTHER MAJOR GENERALS WERE PROMOTED TO 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL AND WILL SOON BE GIVEN NEW POSTS, 
ACCORDING TO MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SOURCES: 
 
-- EASTERN REGIONAL COMMANDER MAUNG AYE WILL BECOME 
THE NOMINAL \"NUMBER TWO\" IN THE MILITARY HIERARCHY, 
FILLING A VACANCY THAT HAS EXISTED SINCE GENERAL THAN 
SHWE REPLACED SENIOR GENERAL SAW MAUNG AS SLORC 
CHAIRMAN AND DEFENSE SERVICES COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 
ALMOST A YEAR AGO.  MOST SOURCES BELIEVE THAT MAUNG 
AYE WILL SOON BECOME DEPUTY CINC OF THE DEFENSE 
SERVICES (TATMADAW) BUT REMAIN UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE 
WILL ALSO MOVE INTO THE VACANT ARMY CINC AND/OR SLORC 
DEPUTY CHAIRMANSHIP POSITIONS.  THAN SHWE HAD OCCUPIED 
THESE POSTS CONCURRENTLY WITH THE NUMBER TWO 
\"TATMADAW\" SLOT. 
 
-- POWERFUL MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF KHIN NYUNT 
WILL REPORTEDLY MOVE INTO A NEWLY CREATED THREE-STAR 
POSITION AS DIRECTOR OF \"STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE\" 
(SOURCES ARE UNSURE OF THE PRECISE TITLE) WHILE 
RETAINING HIS POSITION AS SLORC SECRETARY-1.  HE MAY 
GIVE UP THE FORMAL DESIGNATION AS DIRECTOR OF DEFENSE 
SERVICES INTELLIGENCE (DDSI) BUT HIS NEW, BROADER 
DUTIES WILL INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF DDSI AS WELL AS ALL 
OTHER MILITARY AND CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. 
 
-- TIN 00 WILL KEEP HIS JOB AS SLORC SECRETARY-2 WHILE 
MOVING FROM ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF TO HEAD ONE OF THE 
MILITARY\'S TWO BUREAUX OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS (BSO-I). 
HE REPLACES LIEUTENANT GENERAL AND MINISTER OF 
INDUSTRY-1 SEIN AUNG IN THIS POSITION, RESPONSIBLE FOR 
COORDINATING ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS IN UPPER BURMA. 
 
-- MILITARY APPOINTMENTS SECRETARY MAUNG HLA WILL 
REPLACE LIEUTENANT GENERAL AND FORESTRY MINISTER CHIT 
SWE AS HEAD OF THE OTHER SPECIAL OPERATIONS BUREAU 
(BSO-II), RESPONSIBLE FOR LOWER BURMA MILITARY ACTIONS. 
 
4. (LOU)  CHIEF OF STATE THAN SHWE DELIVERED THE 
TRADITIONAL ARMED FORCES DAY ADDRESS FOCUSING ON THE 
TATMADAW\'S HISTORY IN THE STRUGGLES AGAINST 
IMPERIALISM, FASCISM, AND INTERNAL INSURGENCY (REF C). 
THE SPEECH WAS LESS HARD-LINE THAN THOSE GIVEN BY SAW 
MAUNG ON THIS OCCASION IN RECENT YEARS, OMITTING 
HOSTILE REFERENCES TO THE BRITISH AND JAPANESE WHICH 
HAD RILED THOSE NATIONS\' DEFENSE ATTACHES.  THAN SHWE 
SHOWED NO SIGN OF COMPROMISING ON DOMESTIC POLITICAL 
ISSUES, HOWEVER:  WHILE HE REPEATED THE MILITARY\'S 
STANDARD PROMISE TO TRANSFER POWER AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE, HE INSISTED THAT THE TATMADAW MUST PLAY A 
LEADING ROLE IN BURMA\'S FUTURE POLITICAL SYSTEM. 
 
5. (LOU)  ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH ARMED FORCES DAY, 
THE GOB PUBLISHED SPECIAL NEWSPAPER SUPPLEMENTS AND 
ORGANIZED AN EXHIBIT ON THE HISTORY OF THE TATMADAW 
AND ITS LEADING PERSONALITIES.  SEVERAL OBSERVERS 
NOTED THE STARK CONTRAST WITH THE TENOR OF LAST YEAR\'S 
COMMEMORATION, WHICH FEATURED GUSHING TRIBUTES TO THE 
MILITARY CAREER OF SLORC CHAIRMAN SAW MAUNG.  THIS 
YEAR THERE WERE NOTABLE GAPS WHERE THERE HAD ONCE BEEN 
REFERENCES TO THE EX-CHIEF OF STATE.  WHILE FORMER 
DICTATOR NE WIN STILL FIGURES PROMINENTLY IN THE 
TATMADAW\'S HISTORY, SAW MAUNG -- THE MAN WHO ONCE 
CLAIMED HE HAD \"SAVED BURMA\" -- HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A 
NON-PERSON. 
 
6. (C)  COMMENT:  THIS YEAR\'S ARMED FORCES DAY 
PROMOTIONS APPEAR TO SIGNAL STABILITY RATHER THAN 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WITHIN BURMA\'S RULING CIRCLE. 
SEVERAL OF THE RECENTLY APPOINTED GOVERNMENT MINISTERS 
-- SUCH AS TUN KYI, KYAW BA, AND KYAW MIN -- WERE 
PROBABLY GIVEN THEIR THIRD STARS AS BELATED PAY-OFFS 
FOR THEIR EARLIER AGREEMENT (UNDER PRESSURE) TO GIVE 
UP LUCRATIVE POSITIONS AS REGIONAL COMMANDERS. 
PROMOTING VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE SLORC\'S MAJOR GENERALS 
ALSO EASED THE WAY FOR KHIN NYUNT\'S OWN ELEVATION TO 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL:  ELEVATING THE RELATIVELY JUNIOR 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE ALIENATED 
THOSE WITH GREATER MILITARY SENIORITY.  WHILE WE 
ASSUME HE WILL SHOW DUE RESPECT FOR THE COMMANDING 
ROLES OF THAN SHWE AND NOW MAUNG AYE, WE WOULD STILL 
EXPECT KHIN NYUNT TO CALL THE SHOTS ON MOST DOMESTIC 
AND FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES.  WHATEVER HIS NEW FORMAL 
TITLE, THIS WILL BE LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE ROLE HE 
FIRMLY OCCUPIES AS POLITICAL STRATEGIST AND 
DECISION-MAKER ON ALL IMPORTANT ISSUES.

2.  SUMMARY:  DESPITE UNUSUALLY INCLEMENT WEATHER, THE 
49TH BURMQY WENT OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT ON MARCH 27.  IN 
HIS HOLIDAY ADDRESS, SLORC CHAIRMAN THAN SHWE STRESSED 
THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE MILITARY IN BURMESE NATION- 
BUILDING AND CALLED FOR NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND 
STABILITY.  WITHOUT PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT ARMY CINC LTG 
MAUNG AYE WAS AWARDED HIS FOURTH STAR ON MARCH 21, THUS 
FIRMING UP HIS FORMAL SUPERIOR RANKING TO POWERFUL 
INTELLIGENCE CZAR LTG KHIN NYUNT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
DON\'T RAIN ON MY PARADE 
----------------------- 
 
3.  THE MOST REMARKABLE ASPECT OF THE RITUAL MASS 
MARCH AND SPEECH BY THE DEFENSE SERVICES COMMANDER AND 
SLORC CHIEF, SENIOR GENERAL THAN SHWE, WAS THE 
UNSEASONAL SQUALL (THE FIRST IN 118 YEARS OF 
RECORD-KEEPING) THAT COINCIDED WITH THE EVENTS. 
SHOWING THEIR METTLE, NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THE SLORC 
FLINCHED FOR AN UMBRELLA; NEWSPAPER PHOTOS SHOW THE 
WHOLE SLORC LINEUP, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAN SHWE, 
SOAKED TO THE SKIN.  NOT SURPRISINGLY GIVEN THE 
STRENGTH OF SUPERSTITION HERE, THE FREAK WEATHER 
PROVED TO BE GRIST FOR THE MILLS OF THE MANY BURMESE 
LOOKING HERE FOR OMENS OF THE SLORC\'S IMPENDING DEMISE. 
 
4.  IN A SHORT AND MINIMALLY POLEMICAL SPEECH, SENIOR 
GENERAL THAN SHWE CHARACTERIZED THE MILITARY\'S MAIN 
TASK NOW AS CREATING CONDITIONS TO ENSURE POLITICAL 
AND ECONOMIC STABILITY EVEN AFTER POWER IS TRANSFERRED 
TO A NOMINALLY CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT (NO TIMEFRAME 
SPECIFIED).  HE LAID SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON NATIONAL 
RECONCILIATION BUT SPOKE SPECIFICALLY ONLY OF THE NEED 
FOR A MEETING OF THE MINDS WITH ARMED INSURGENTS, NOT 
THE SLORC\'S POLITICAL OPPONENTS.  HE ALSO POINTED TO 
THE NATIONAL CONVENTION AND THE NEW CONSTITUTION AS 
SERIOUS FACTORS IN BURMA\'S POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT. 
INTERESTINGLY, THOUGH THAN SHWE HIMSELF CLAIMED \"THE 
NATION IS STRONG ONLY WHEN THE TATMADAW (ARMY) IS 
STRONG,\" THE GOVERNMENT RADIO COMMENTATOR REMINDED 
LISTENERS THAT THE MILITARY EXISTS FOR THE COUNTRY, 
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.  NOTE:  WHETHER COINCIDENTAL 
OR NOT, THIS PHRASE WAS FREQUENTLY USED BY AUNG SAN 
SUU KYI DURING HER PRO-DEMOCRACY CAMPAIGNING. 
 
5. (ORIGINAL TEXT MISSIN) ...WESTERN AMBASSADORS 
EITHER HAVING DISCREETLY LEFT TOWN FOR THE WEEKEND OR 
SIMPLY DECLINING OUTRIGHT THEIR INVITATION TO THE ARMED 
FORCES DAY BANQUET, THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR FOUND 
HIMSELF THE TEMPORARY DEAN OF THE LOCAL DIPLOMATIC 
CORPS.  BESIDES OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES, RUSSIA, 
YUGOSLAVIA AND ISRAEL ALL SENT DIPLOMATS TO THE 
DINNER, WHICH REPORTEDLY WAS OTHERWISE UNREMARKABLE. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
ERADICATING HISTORY WITH A HISTORY MUSEUM 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.  REGARDING OTHER ASPECTS OF THE ARMED FORCES DAY 
CELEBRATION, SEVERAL CONSPICUOUS PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS 
WERE SUCCESSFULLY RUSHED TO COMPLETION IN TIME FOR THE 
HOLIDAY.  THESE INCLUDED A DAM NEAR PROME, A 
MILITARY-SPONSORED BUDDHIST MONASTERY NEAR THE 
SHWEDAGON PAGODA, AND THE DEFENSE SERVICES MUSEUM. 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE MASSIVE NEW MUSEUM ENTAILED THE 
DEMOLITION OF THE COLONIAL-ERA JUBILEE HALL, THE SITE 
OF MANY IMPORTANT EVENTS IN BURMA\'S POST-INDEPENDENCE 
HISTORY (INCLUDING AUNG SAN\'S STATE FUNERAL).  THE 
MUSEUM\'S INITIAL EXHIBITION FOCUSES ON BURMESE 
MILITARY HISTORY (LESS HISTRIONIC THAN EXPECTED) AND 
THE WORK OF THE REGIONAL COMMANDS.  INDICATIVE OF THE 
SEAMLESSNESS OF THE MILITARY/GOVERNMENT WEB HERE, EACH 
MINISTRY, WHETHER OR NOT HEADED BY A MEMBER OF THE 
ARMED FORCESQY DEVOTED TO ITSACTIVITIES. PUBLIC 
ATTENDANCE HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN DISAPPOINTING. 
 
----------------- 
A QUIET PROMOTION 
----------------- 
 
7.  TO DATE THE SLORC HAS NOT USED THE ARMED FORCES 
CELEBRATION TO ANNOUNCE PROMOTIONS.  ACCORDINGLY, 
WITHOUT FANFARE, THE ARMY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, LTG 
MAUNG AYE, WAS AWARDED HIS FOURTH STAR ON MARCH 21. 
SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN LISTED SIMPLY AS \"GENERAL,\" 
INCLUDING IN THE PORTRAIT PANTHEON MOUNTED IN THE 
ENTRANCE OF THE JUST OPENED DEFENSE SERVICES MUSEUM. 
GOB CONTACTS VIEW HIS PROMOTION AS SIMPLY ROUTINE, 
COMING AFTER THE TRADITIONAL YEAR\'S WAIT IN THE FOUR 
STAR ARMY CINC BILLET.  ALL THE SAME, MAUNG AYE NOW 
FORMALLY OUTRANKS KHIN NYUNT AND IS EVEN MORE THAN 
BEFORE THE OBVIOUS CHOICE TO SUCCEED THAN SHWE, SHOULD 
THE SLORC CHIEF CEDE THE REINS ANYTIME SOON.

1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  THE CHINESE DCM TOLD US THE PRC 
CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING POLITICAL DIALOGUE, 
AND BELIEVES THE MILITARY REGIME IS SINCERE IN ITS 
DEALINGS WITH AUNG SAN SUU KYI (ASSK).  WHILE HE 
STATED HIS BELIEF THAT OUTSIDE PRESSURE IS COUNTER- 
PRODUCTIVE, HE GAVE SOME REASON TO BELIEVE BEIJING 
MIGHT PROVIDE DISCREET SUPPORT FOR RAZALI\'S 
INITIATIVE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE DIALOGUE 
------------ 
 
2.  (C)  CHINESE DCM TANG YING TOLD DCM ON 26 JULY 
THAT CHINA CLOSELY FOLLOWS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN 
BURMA AND HAS BEEN CONCERNED FOR SOME TIME ABOUT 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STABILITY IN THIS COUNTRY (REF 
A).  ACCORDING TO TANG, THE PRC SEES BURMA\'S 
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM AS POLITICAL. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        RANGOO  01171  01 OF 02  282145Z 
3.  (C)  TANG NOTED THAT BEIJING WELCOMES THE 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN ASSK AND THE RULING STATE PEACE AND 
DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL (SPDC) AND HOPES THAT IT WILL, 
OVER TIME, LEAD TO A MORE STABLE POLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT WHICH WILL PERMIT BURMA TO DEVELOP MORE 
RAPIDLY ECONOMICALLY.  HIS GOVERNMENT WAS PLEASED TO 
SEE THE RELEASE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND REOPENING 
OF A HANDFUL OF NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY (NLD) 
LOCAL OFFICES. 
 
4.  (C)  TANG BELIEVES THAT THE SENIOR SPDC 
LEADERSHIP IS QUITE SERIOUS AND SINCERE ABOUT TRYING 
TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE NLD THAT WOULD RESOLVE 
THE POLITICAL IMPASSE.  HE BELIEVES THE SPDC IS 
TAKING A LARGE RISK IN ENGAGING IN TALKS, BOTH 
BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE DISSENTION WITHIN THE MILITARY 
ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED, AND BECAUSE IT RISKS FURTHER 
PRESSURE AND CONDEMNATION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY IF THE TALKS FAIL. 
 
5.  (C)  TANG ASSERTED THAT THE RESOLUTION OF BURMA\'S 
POLITICAL PROBLEMS IS PRIMARILY A DOMESTIC ISSUE, 
WHICH MUST BE RESOLVED BY THE VARIOUS BURMESE 
PARTIES.  HE STRESSED THAT FROM BEIJING\'S 
PERSPECTIVE, OUTSIDE PRESSURE OR INTERFERENCE COULD 
IN FACT COMPLICATE BURMESE RESOLUTION OF THE 
POLITICAL STALEMATE IN THE COUNTRY.  HE SUGGESTED 
THAT THE BEST THING THE USG COULD DO AT THIS STAGE 
WAS TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT THE PROCESS.  HE BELIEVED 
THIS WAS THE BEST WAY TO ENCOURAGE THE SPDC TO TAKE 
FURTHER STEPS. 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        RANGOO  01171  01 OF 02  282145Z 
 
6.  (C)  TANG NOTED THAT CHINA WAS INTERESTED IN THE 
RAZALI PROCESS, BUT DID NOT OFFER A STRONG STATEMENT 
OF SUPPORT FOR IT, EVEN AFTER OUR BEING TOLD OF THE 
IMPORTANCE THE USG ATTACHES TO THIS INITIATIVE.  HE 
DID SAY THAT THE CHINESE AMBASSADOR HAD TRIED TO 
ATTEND RAZALI\'S BRIEFING DURING HIS JUNE VISIT, BUT 
MISSED IT WHEN HE DID NOT RECEIVE WORD ON THE CHANGED 
TIME AND LOCATION OF THE BRIEFING. 
 
RECENT CHINESE OFFICIAL VISITS 
------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C)  TANG EXPLAINED THAT THE RECENT TRAVEL OF 
YUNNAN PROVINCIAL VICE GOVERNOR SHAO QIWEI TO BURMA 
WAS TO INSPECT THE PAUNGLAUNG HYDROPOWER PLANT.  TANG 
DECLINED TO ESTIMATE WHEN THIS PLANT (WHICH IS BEHIND 
SCHEDULE) MIGHT BE PUT INTO SERVICE.  HE NOTED THAT 
THE RECENT VISIT OF THE MINISTER FOR RURAL PLANNING 
AND LAND USE HAD RESULTED IN AN MOU TO COOPERATE IN 
MINING.  TANG SAID THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC

9.  (C)  COMMENT:  AS NOTED IN REF B, RAZALI MAY BE

INITIATIVE.  OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH TANG LEAD US TO 
BELIEVE THAT, WHILE THERE WILL BE DISTINCT LIMITS TO 
CHINESE WILLINGNESS TO PUSH FOR CHANGE PUBLICLY, THE 
CHINESE EMBASSY HERE MAY BE WILLING TO QUIETLY 
SUPPORT THE PROCESS.  TANG HAS TOLD US PREVIOUSLY 
THAT HE AND OTHER EMBASSY OFFICERS HAVE ADVOCATED FOR 
BASIC REFORM IN INFORMAL CONTACTS WITH BURMESE 
COUNTERPARTS.  AS A MAJOR SUPPORTER OF THE SPDC, 
CHINESE VIEWS, HOWEVER DISCREETLY THEY MAY BE 
TRANSMITTED, ARE LIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT.  FROM THE 
CHINESE STANDPOINT, A MORE STABLE AND ECONOMICALLY 
VIBRANT BURMA WOULD MAKE A BETTER NEIGHBOR.

REF: (A) BANGKOK 2907 (B) BANGKOK 3147 (C) RANGOON 574 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CDA PRISCILLA CLAPP. REASON: 1.5 (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: THE THAI GOVERNMENT WAS PLEASED WITH BURMESE 
ARMY COMMANDER MAUNG AYE\'S VISIT. ACCORDING TO THE THAI 
EMBASSY\'S POLITICAL COUNSELOR, THE THAI GOVERNMENT NOW SEES 
HIM AS A \"PRAGMATIC\" MAN OF RISING INFLUENCE IN BURMA WITH 
WHOM THEY MAY BE ABLE TO WORK SUCCESSFULLY. WHILE IN 
THAILAND, MAUNG AYE MET WITH THE KING, PRIME MINISTER THAKSIN 
AND DEFENSE MINISTER CHAVALIT.  HE ALSO PROMISED TO IMPROVE 
COUNTER-NARCOTICS COOPERATION, TO RESTRICT THE ACTIVITIES OF 
THE UNITED WA STATE ARMY\'S HONG PANG COMPANY AND TO ESTABLISH 
TWO NEW TOWNSHIP BORDER COMMITTEES.  IN ADDITION, HE PUT THE 
FINAL TOUCHES ON A NEW FISHERIES JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT 
WHICH WILL REPORTEDLY BE SIGNED IN RANGOON THIS WEEK.  ON THE 
OTHER HAND, MAUNG AYE DID NOT RESPOND TO THE MESSAGE CONVEYED 
BY THAI FOREIGN MINISTER SURARKIART TO SECRETARY 1 KHIN NYUNT 
IN EARLY APRIL REGARDING PROPOSALS FROM THE SHAN STATE ARMY 
FOR TALKS, THOUGH THE CURRENT QUIET ON THE BORDER HAS 
SUGGESTED TO SOME WITHIN THE THAI GOVERNMENT THAT TALKS MAY 
HAVE ALREADY STARTED. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) MAUNG AYE AND KHIN NYUNT: THE THAI EMBASSY\'S POLITICAL 
COUNSELOR, KALLAYANA VIPATTIPUMIPRATES, TOLD POLOFF MAY 2 
THAT THE RECENT VISIT BY BURMESE ARMY COMMANDER MAUNG AYE TO 
THAILAND HAD GONE WELL. MAUNG AYE, HE SAID, WAS NOW A FIGURE 
OF MAJOR INTEREST TO THE THAIS. MANY FELT THAT MAUNG AYE\'S 
POSITION WITHIN THE GOB WAS ENHANCED AND KHIN NYUNT\'S 
DIMINISHED BY EVENTS IN MARCH, INCLUDING THE ARREST OF THE 
FAMILY OF KHIN NYUNT\'S MENTOR AND PATRON.  KHIN NYUNT, HE 
SAID, STILL SEEMED TO BE FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF FOREIGN POLICY 
AND THE MILITARY\'S INTELLIGENCE NETWORK.  HOWEVER, THERE WERE 
SIGNS THAT HE NO LONGER HAD A FREE HAND IN DEALING WITH 
BORDER ISSUES AND BURMA\'S MANY ETHNIC GROUPS.  SEVERAL GROUPS 
CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH KHIN NYUNT, INCLUDING SOME CEASEFIRE 
GROUPS AND SOME ETHNIC CHURCH GROUPS (THE KACHIN BAPTIST 
CONVENTION), HAD RECENTLY COME UNDER PRESSURE, KALLAYANA SAID. 
 
3. (C) MAUNG AYE, MEANWHILE, WAS A MYSTERY MAN FOR THE THAIS 
-- THE SUBJECT OF MANY CONTRADICTORY REPORTS REGARDING HIS 
FEELINGS TOWARDS THAILAND AND HIS PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE. 
AFTER MEETINGS BETWEEN MAUNG AYE AND THE KING, THE PRIME 
MINISTER (ON FOUR SEPARATE OCCASIONS) AND DEFENSE MINISTER 
CHAVALIT, HOWEVER, THE THAIS HAD COME AWAY WITH THE 
IMPRESSION THAT MAUNG AYE WAS \"A PRAGMATIC MAN\" WHO WAS \"NOT 
NECESSARILY HOSTILE TO THAILAND.\" 
 
4. (C) ETHNIC GROUPS: KALLAYANA SAID THAT THE THAIS HAD 
EXPECTED MAUNG AYE TO RESPOND TO THE MESSAGE REGARDING TALKS 
WITH THE SHAN STATE ARMY WHICH THAI FOREIGN MINISTER 
SURAKIART HAD RELAYED TO KHIN NYUNT IN EARLY APRIL (REFTEL 
A).  THAT MESSAGE BASICALLY STATED THAT THE SHAN STATE ARMY 
WAS READY FOR TALKS, BUT WOULD ONLY ACCEPT TERMS COMPARABLE 
TO THOSE GIVEN THE WA, WHICH WOULD LEAVE THEM IN CONTROL OF 
THEIR OWN CEASEFIRE AREA.  MAUNG AYE, HOWEVER,  SAID NOTHING 
ABOUT THE MATTER AT ALL.  THIS LED THE THAIS TO CONCLUDE, 
KALLAYANA SAID, THAT THE BURMESE HAD EITHER DISMISSED THE 
SHAN STATE ARMY\'S PROPOSED TERMS AS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, 
OR HAD ALREADY ESTABLISHED A BASIS FOR TALKS WITH THE SHAN 
STATE ARMY WITHOUT THAI HELP.  IN ANY CASE, KALLAYANA NOTED, 
THE NORTHERN BORDER THIS YEAR WAS FAR QUIETER THAN IT HAD 
BEEN FOR SOME TIME. 
 
5. (C) KALLAYANA ALSO SAID THAT THE THAI GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN 
IN TOUCH WITH THE KAREN NATIONAL UNION\'S FORMER CHAIRMAN BO 
MYA WHILE HE WAS HOSPITALIZED IN BANGKOK. THE KNU, HE SAID, 
WAS GROWING WEAKER AND WEAKER, AND BO MYA BELIEVED THAT IT 
WAS TIME TO STRIKE A DEAL WITH THE BURMESE. 
 
6. (C) BORDER INCIDENTS: KALLAYANA SAID THAT THE MOST RECENT 
BORDER INCIDENT, WHICH ERUPTED LAST WEEK WHEN UNITS FROM THE 
THAI THIRD ARMY TOOK PRISONER THE SON OF THE COMMANDER OF THE 
WA\'S 171ST BRIGADE, WOULD PROBABLY BE RESOLVED WITHIN DAYS. 
THIRD ARMY COMMANDER UDOMCHAI, HE SAID, WAS JUST TRYING TO 
TEACH THE WA A LESSON.  UDOMCHAI HAD BEEN PERSONALLY 
EMBARASSED BY A WA ATTACK THAT HAD FORCED CANCELLATION OF A 
VISIT BY THE THAI QUEEN TO HIS AREA, AND HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR 
WAYS EVER SINCE TO PAY THE WA BACK. KALLAYANA SAID THAT HE 
EXPECTED BORDER INCIDENTS LIKE THIS MOST RECENT ONE TO 
CONTINUE, GIVEN UDOMCHAI\'S ANGER, BUT EMPHASIZED THAT THEY 
DID NOT REFLECT THAI GOVERNMENT POLCIY AND WOULD NOT 
INTERRUPT THE GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN THAI/BURMESE RELATIONS. 
 
7. (C) NARCOTICS COOPERATION: PM THAKSIN TOLD MAUNG AYE THAT 
THERE NEEDED TO BE GREATER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE THAI 
OFFICE OF THE NARCOTICS CONTROL BOARD AND THE BURMESE CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE FOR DRUG ABUSE CONTROL IN SHARING INTELLIGENCE AND 
CARRYING OUT JOINT OPERATIONS.  MAUNG AYE AND BURMESE HOME 
MINISTER TIN HLAING, WHO SAT IN ON THE MEETING, AGREED. 
THAKSIN ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE HONG PANG 
COMPANY, WHICH IS THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR MOST OF THE WA 
COMMERCIAL INVESTMENTS, AND RECEIVED A COMMITMENT FROM MAUNG 
AYE THAT THE HONG PANG COMPANY WOULD BE SHUT DOWN \"WITHIN TWO 
WEEKS.\"  MOREOVER, ACCORDING TO KALLAYANA, THAI INTELLIGENCE 
REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE COMPANY\'S BRANCHES ON THE BORDER 
ARE INDEED BEING SHUT DOWN. 
 
8. (C) ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: KALLAYANA SAID THAT 2,860 ILLEGAL 
BURMESE IMMIGRANTS HAD BEEN RETURNED TO BURMA AS OF APRIL 30. 
 ANOTHER 20,000 WERE IN HOLDING CAMPS IN THAILAND.  HE NOTED 
THAT THE THAIS WERE PRESSING FOR QUICKER REPATRIATIONS AND 
HAD ASKED THE BURMESE TO OPEN TWO ADDITIONAL RECEIVING 
CENTERS AT KAWTHOUNG AND TACHILEIK, IN ADDITION TO MYAWADDY. 
HE ALSO SAID THAT THE THAIS HAD AGREED TO SCREEN RETURNEES 
FOR HIV/AIDS, BUT HAD MADE NO COMMITMENTS REGARDING SHARING 
THE TREATMENT COSTS FOR THE MANY BURMESE WHO MAY HAVE 
CONTRACTED AIDS IN THAILAND.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THAILAND HAD 
RAISED WITH THE BURMESE THE POSSIBILITY OF INVOLVING THE 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION (IOM) IN THE 
REPATRIATION EXERCISE, BUT SAID THAT THE BURMESE HAD NOT YET 
REPLIED TO THAT PROPOSAL. 
 
9. (C) BORDER DEMARKATION AND CONTROL:  THERE HAD BEEN NO 
FURTHER PROGRESS ON BORDER DEMARKATION, KALLAYANA SAID, BUT 
PM THAKSIN HAD ASKED MAUNG AYE TO OPEN TWO NEW TOWNSHIP 
BORDER COMMITTEES IN THE KANCHANBURI AND THREE PAGODAS PASS 
AREAS.  HE ALSO PROPOSED THAT THE TOWNSHIP BORDER COMMITTEES 
REMAIN PERMANENTLY IN SESSION TO HANDLE ANY DISPUTES THAT DID 
EMERGE.  MAUNG AYE REPORTEDLY AGREED TO BOTH PROPOSALS. 
 
10. (C) FISHERIES: THE FINAL DETAILS OF THE GIANT FISHERIES 
JOINT VENTURE WHICH THE THAIS AND THE BURMESE HAVE BEEN 
NEGOTIATING SINCE THAKSIN\'S JUNE 2001 VISIT WERE REPORTEDLY 
WORKED OUT DURING MAUNG AYE\'S VISIT.  THE AGREEMENT WILL 
REPORTEDLY BE SIGNED THIS WEEK IN RANGOON AND THE FIRST 
OPERATIONS SHOULD START SHORTLY THEREAFTER. 
 
COMMENT 
 
11. (C) THREE POINTS ARE WORTH NOTING HERE.  FIRST, THE 
THAI/BURMESE RECONCILIATION THAT BEGAN LAST SPRING IS STILL 
MOVING FORWARD.  THE TWO COUNTRIES SEEM AS DETERMINED NOW AS 
THEN TO ROOT OUT THE PROBLEMS -- FROM ILLEGAL MIGRATION TO 
NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING AND SUPPORT FOR INSURGENT GROUPS -- 
THAT HAVE PLAGUED THEIR RELATIONS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL 
DECADES.  MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE, BUT THEY ARE STILL 
WORKING ON THE ISSUES. 
 
12. (C) SECONDLY, THE THAIS ARE PROBABLY RIGHT TO PAY MORE 
ATTENTION TO MAUNG AYE, THOUGH THEY MAY BE OVER-EMPHASIZING 
THE DEGREE TO WHICH MAUNG AYE\'S STAR HAS RISEN IN RECENT 
WEEKS. CERTAINLY MAUNG AYE APPEARS TO HAVE GAINED FROM THE 
NOVEMBER RE-ORGANIZATION OF THE REGIONAL COMMANDS, WHICH 
ALLOWED HIM TO PLACE OFFICERS HE TRUSTED IN MAJOR COMMAND 
POSITIONS.  HOWEVER, HIS GREATER INFLUENCE ON BORDER ISSUES, 
PARTICULARLY ISSUES AFFECTING THE ETHNIC AND CEASEFIRE 
GROUPS, MAY SIMPLY REFLECT A GROWING FEELING WITHIN THE 
GOVERNMENT THAT RELATIONS WITH THESE GROUPS ON THE BORDER ARE 
A SECURITY MATTER FOR THE ARMY. AS SUCH, THEY MAY NOW BE 
CONSIDERED MORE PART OF MAUNG AYE\'S PORTFOLIO, RATHER THAN 
KHIN NYUNT\'S. 
 
13. (C) FINALLY, MAUNG AYE\'S COMMITMENT REGARDING THE 
SHUTDOWN OF THE HONG PANG COMPANY WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED 
CLOSELY. THAT COMPANY NOW HOLDS MOST OF THE UNITED WA STATE 
ARMY\'S COMMERCIAL INVESTMENTS, AND IS HEAVILY INVOLVED IN A 
NUMBER OF LARGE CAPITAL PROJECTS.  IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT 
THE WA WOULD SIMPLY WRAP IT UP ON ORDERS FROM THE BURMESE. 
MORE LIKELY, THEY WILL SIMPLY MOVE ITS OPERATIONS OFF THE 
BORDER. IN FACT, LABOR MINISTER TIN WINN CONFIRMED TO THE 
CHARGE\' ON MAY 6 (REFTEL C) THAT SOME HONG PANG BRANCH 
OFFICES IN TACHILEIK AND AND OTHER BORDER TOWNS WERE BEING 
CLOSED.  FURTHERMORE, EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS LQUIDATED, IT 
COULD RE-EMERGE UNDER ANOTHER NAME.  THE WA NEED SOME VEHICLE 
TO HOLD THEIR INVESTMENTS AND LIKELY WILL RESPOND TO ANY 
PRESSURE FROM THE BURMESE WITH CHANGES THAT ARE AT BEST 
COSMETIC. END SUMMARY.

REF: RANGOON 613 
 
Classified By: CDA PRISCILLA A. CLAPP FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  The regime announced yesterday that it 
had released 32 political prisoners; 14 NLD members and 18 
others, mostly students.  The NLD was told of only 24 
releases, its 14 members and 10 students the regime said were 
arrested for supporting NLD activities.  Despite the 
discrepancy in reporting, the NLD hopes these releases 
presage more significant releases of NLD members and students 
in conjunction with the upcoming visit of Special Envoy 
Razali and others. End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  The regime announced the release of 32 political 
prisoners yesterday (7/28); 14 NLD members and 18 others. 
Following its normal procedure, the regime faxed a brief 
statement from its spokesperson to selected &friendly8 
embassies (the U.S. is not among them) and local press 
representatives.  The statement provided just the names of 
those released and stated that they had been returned to 
their families from various correctional facilities and were 
&resting comfortably.8   This was the largest single 
release of prisoners by the regime since talks with NLD 
General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi began in December 1999. 
None of the 14 NLD prisoners were senior or prominent 
officials although two were township level leaders before 
their arrests.  Most of the non-NLD prisoners were students 
who were arrested along with NLD members but were not 
registered party members. 
 
NLD notified of only 24 releases..... 
 
3. (C)  Visiting NLD headquarters to obtain their views on 
the releases, Poloff was told that NLD Secretary U Lwin had 
received a call from Military Intelligence (MI) alerting him 
only to the release of 14 NLD members and 10 students who 
were arrested with NLD members.  MI did not mention the other 
eight releases which the regime had announced to others.  U 
Lwin did not have any explanation for the discrepancy. 
(Note:  The difference in the method the regime notified the 
NLD and the press and the differences in the numbers provided 
is just one example of how carefully the regime continues to 
attempt to control information.  Perhaps the regime did not 
provide eight of the names to the NLD because the prisoners 
were not affiliated with the NLD, although their releases 
were certainly a result of NLD efforts.  As usual, however, 
the regime provided no explanation for its actions. End 
Note.) 
 
4. (SBU)  This discrepancy in numbers aside, U Lwin was 
pleased with the releases, noting that although no 
significant NLD leaders were released the number of prisoners 
released is much higher than the five to ten prisoners the 
regime has been releasing periodically since the talks began. 
 He said he believes the releases are an effort to 
demonstrate political progress prior to upcoming visits to 
Burma by UN Special Envoy Razali (8/2), Japanese Foreign 
Minister Kawaguchi (8/3), and Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir (8/18). 
 
More releases imminent? 
 
5. (C)  This release of 14 NLD members brings the total 
number of remaining NLD prisoners down to 261, according to U 
Lwin.  He said that he is hopeful that the regime will 
&clean the slate8 and release the remaining prisoners in 
conjunction with Special Envoy Razali,s visit.  This is a 
necessary and long overdue action which would pave the way 
for progress on dialogue, he said. 
 
6. (SBU)  U Lwin was also pleased that the regime included 
student activists in these releases.  He said the NLD has no 
estimate of the number of these activists remaining in prison 
but there are many.  Many of these students, he explained, 
were arrested for participating in NLD rallies when they were 
quite young and had little understanding of the consequences 
of their actions.  Some who are still in prison were arrested 
as long ago as 1989, according to U Lwin.  He and Vice 
Chairman U Tin Oo expressed hope that yesterday,s releases 
are a harbinger of more student releases in the near future. 
7. (SBU)  Discussing the total number of remaining political 
prisoners, U Lwin said the NLD does not know how many non-NLD 
ethnic political prisoners exist in addition to the student 
activists.  He said the number of Karen, Shan, and other 
ethnic political prisoners could be substantial, especially 
near the border areas.  (Note:  This explains in part at 
least the continuing inconsistent estimates of political 
prisoners by Amnesty International, ICRC, and others. End 
Note.)

1. (C)  National League for Democracy Central Executive 
Committee members (\"the uncles\") told Chief of Mission on 
September 9 that they appreciate continued U.S. support for 
their party and encourage increased pressure on the regime 
for democratic change.  COM Martinez agreed with the uncles 
that the regime may be backing away from political 
reconciliation at this time, but also noted that it was 
illogical to do so with the EU troika in Rangoon and the UN 
General Assembly about to convene.  She assured them of 
continued U.S. pressure for democratic reform but cautioned 
that the threat of a trade ban would be more effective than 
actually imposing the ban.  The uncles also mentioned that 
Aung San Suu Kyi has not met with Secretary One - Lt. General 
Khin Nyunt or Senior General Than Shwe since her release from 
house detention on May 6.  End Summary 
 
Uncles Thank U.S. For Continued Support; Request More Pressure 
 
2. (C)  At an introductory meeting with Chief of Mission 
Carmen Martinez on September 9, NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe, 
Vice Chairman U Tin Oo, Secretary U Lwin, and Central 
Executive Committee member U Nyunt Wei (the uncles) said they 
appreciated continued U.S. support for their efforts to move 
the regime toward democratic reform.  For instance, they 
said, they were \"very pleased, very happy\" that the U.S. had 
expressed concern over the recent arrest and sentencing of 
two NLD members for possessing a banned publication. (Note: 
They said they heard this on a short-wave radio broadcast. 
End Note.)  COM Martinez asked how the uncles interpreted the 
regime\'s latest series of actions.  She noted that the regime 
has had several opportunities recently to do simple things - 
releasing political prisoners, investigating Shan rape cases, 
not arresting NLD members and students protesters - that 
would have helped mute international criticism.  Instead the 
regime appears to have decided to assert control just as the 
EU troika is in Rangoon, the UN resolution on Burma is being 
formulated, and the UN General Assembly is about to convene. 
Chairman U Aung Shwe summed up his assessment of the regime\'s 
backward shift by saying \"they just don\'t want to talk to 
us.\" 
 
3.  (C)  The uncles said the only way the regime would 
continue moving forward on reforms would be in response to 
continued pressure from the U.S. and others.  They said that 
the recent lack of action by the regime after the relatively 
positive atmosphere during the Razali visit was an indication 
that the \"carrots\" some in the international community have 
been using to encourage reform do not have the desired 
effect.  The regime will accept the carrots but allow change 
\"on their own schedule,\" which is far too slow.  CEC member U 
Nyunt Wei asked if the U.S. was still considering a trade ban 
on Burma, noting that this might bring about change.  Asked 
if it would not also hurt the poor by decreasing employment, 
he said it would hit the business people closest to the 
regime most and they would, in turn, put pressure for reform 
on the generals.  COM Martinez said she would pass this view 
on, but noted that the threat of a trade ban would probably 
be more effective pressure than implementing the ban.  She 
reasoned that the economic effects of the ban would be 
minimal and the generals would use the ban as an excuse for 
their poor state of the economy (Note: As they currently do 
with the investment ban.  End Note). 
 
Party Offices, Newspaper, Legal Actions for Prisoners 
 
4.  (C)  Secretary U Lwin said the NLD is ready to open NLD 
offices nationwide, except for Kayah State, whenever it gets 
agreement with the SPDC.  There are no NLD leaders available 
to staff an office in Kayin State; the State Chairman was 
recently released from prison but he is old and bedridden due 
to a stroke.  Regarding the publication of an NLD newspaper, 
the uncles said the NLD has applied to the Ministry of Home 
Affairs for permission to publish the paper but, \"like so 
many things,\" it is \"under consideration at higher levels.\" 
Regarding the release last week of eight political prisoners, 
the uncles said that most of those released had served most 
of their sentences when they were released.  One, they noted, 
was not an NLD member but a 70-year-old woman arrested in 
1996 or 1997 for operating a copier machine to duplicate 
political materials.  Only two of those released were NLD 
members; others were only supporters of the party. 
5. (C)  Vice Chairman U Tin Oo said the NLD would attempt to 
provide legal assistance to the two students arrested for a 
political protest at city hall on August 18 (refs a and b). 
The NLD is working with a local lawyer, U Kyi Win, to find 
out when and where the students\' trial will be held and to 
provide them legal counsel.  The NLD has been in touch with 
the families of the two students but, so far, the government 
has not notified the families of the trial date.  U Tin Oo 
said the NLD\'s strategy is to force the trial into the public 
realm so the process is at least somewhat transparent. 
Otherwise, he noted, the sentence will just be announced and 
the two will go to prison with no due process. 
 
6. (C)  Adding to the mystery of whether ASSK has met with 
senior level officials since her release on May 6, the uncles 
stated, contrary to what ASSK herself indicated (see ref c, 
para. 4), that she has not met with Secretary One Lt. General 
Khin Nyunt or Senior General Than Shwe. 
 
Comment 
 
7. (C)  The uncles\' call for increased international pressure 
is a familiar refrain, but questions remain as to how 
involved they actually are in the negotiations with the SPDC. 
 Aung San Suu Kyi has held these negotiations very close to 
her chest and even her closest advisors may have little idea 
of what progress is or is not being made.

SUBJECT: PATRIOT DAY IN RANGOON 
 
1.  (U) Some 325 invited guests, including high-ranking GOB 
military and civilian officials, Aung San Suu Kyi and the 
senior NLD leadership, Muslim representatives, ethnic 
leaders, and about 100 resident American citizens gathered 
September 11 in downtown Rangoon to observe Patriot Day. 
COM Martinez presented a short address and read President 
Bush\'s Patriot Day announcement.  The MSG detachment posted 
the colors, a Kachin choir sang U.S. patriotic songs, and 
the gathering observed a minute of silence to honor the 
victims and heroes of the terrorist attacks. 
 
2.  (SBU) Following the 30-minute ceremony, invitees 
repaired to a reception hosted by DAO.  Aung San Suu Kyi\'s 
rare public appearance created a stir, particularly as the 
event also brought together senior military officers, ethnic 
leaders, religious clerics (including the spokesman of 
Burma\'s Shi\'a community), the diplomatic corps, and business 
leaders.  GOB authorities worked closely with the hotel and 
RSO to provide excellent and unobtrusive security for the 
event.  Media coverage was good, and many resident Amcits 
voiced appreciation for being included.  COM drew on very 
helpful media talking points provided by PA for her remarks. 
 
3.  (SBU) This event, a successful, dignified commemoration 
of Patriot Day, also provided a much-needed venue to bring 
together Burmese of various political and ethnic persuasions 
who rarely have the opportunity to meet face-to-face.  ASSK 
told the COM that it was \"wonderful\" to meet with young 
attendees (e.g., the members of the Kachin choir) and also 
with many ambassadors who she said \"rarely come close to 
me.\"  At one point several senior ethnic leader and Aung San 
Suu Kyi were conversing in a corner--we quickly scanned the 
room for the senior GOB representative (instant tripartite 
dialogue?) but he had unfortunately just departed.  Given 
the many compliments we received from numbers ambassadors 
and from ASSK on the excellent contact opportunities the 
event provided, post plans more such large public diplomacy 
events in the future.

SUBJECT: EU TROIKA IN BURMA 
 
Classified By: CDA Ron McMullen. Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: The EU Troika will not recommend any change 
in the EU\'s common position on Burma.  That is the conclusion 
of British diplomats who accompanied the team on all of their 
visits in Yangon. Foreigners were uniformly concerned about 
deteriorating economic conditions, while Aung San Suu Kyi and 
ethnic leaders sharply criticized the government for its 
delay in releasing political prisoners and opening up a 
serious political dialogue on constitutional issues.  EU 
senior officials will meet October 11 to consider the 
Troika\'s report, but, barring dramatic developments between 
now and then, will likely recommend that the EU keep its 
common position unchanged. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The EU Troika completed a disappointing visit to Burma 
September 10 and probably will not recommend any change in 
the EU\'s common position on Burma.  According to British 
Embassy diplomats who accompanied the team on their visits, 
the group met with an almost unrelenting stream of 
pessimistic judgments on the state of the government\'s 
stalled dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and on the economic 
and social situation in Burma.  The singular exception was 
Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win, who assured the 
troika that there was \"a growing sense of confidence in the 
country,\" and \"a strong sense of national identity.\"  The 
country, he said, was on \"the right path to fulfill its 
vision of a united democratic Burma.\" 
 
3.  (C) All others were less sure of the country\'s future. 
Leon de Riedmatten was embarrassed and disappointed by the 
lack of progress in the government\'s talks with Aung San Suu 
Kyi.  Ethnic leaders exhibited a \"touchy reliance\" on Aung 
San Suu Kyi to represent their interests in the current 
political talks, but were unremittingly harsh in their 
condemnation of the government, calling for additional 
sanctions.  Aung San Suu Kyi was more measured in her 
comments but was still \"bitterly disappointed\" by the 
government\'s delays in releasing political prisoners and in 
opening a meaningful political dialogue on constitutional 
issues.  Nevertheless, she reportedly endorsed continued 
humanitarian assistance for Burma and told the EU troika that 
they \"must support UNDP\" in its operations in Burma. 
 
4. (C) Foreign observers were focused on the economy.  ASEAN 
Ambassadors painted a bleak picture, with some suggesting 
that economic hardships could lead to social unrest.  The 
Chinese Ambassador, surprisingly, endorsed this view, 
emphasizing what he saw as an essential need for financial 
reform.  UN and INGO heads, finally, lamented the 
difficulties of work in Burma and showed some discomfort with 
the current need for dual accountability: to both the 
government and Aung San Suu Kyi. While they admitted the 
political necessity of talking to both the government and the 
opposition, every contact they made with one side, they said, 
cost them with the other. That, however, was just life in 
Burma. 
 
5. (C) The troika did not see Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, who was 
apparently detained in Monywa.  The British are not sure how 
to interpret this.  On the one hand, they believe Khin Nyunt 
wanted the troika visit to take place, having overruled 
Foreign Minister Win Aung, who sought to have the visit 
delayed.  On the other hand, Khin Nyunt has been known to 
duck meetings that promise to be difficult, as this one would 
have been. If that was the case this time, then the delays in 
Monywa may just have been a convenient excuse. 
 
6. (C) In any case, the Troika came away from this visit with 
little to use in recommending any changes in the EU\'s common 
position on Burma. They will prepare a report that will be 
considered by a meeting of EU senior officials on October 11, 
but, barring some dramatic changes here between now and then, 
it is hardly likely that the EU will alter its position in 
any significant way. 
 
Comment 
 
7. (C) The EU mission caught the mood of the day in Burma. 
Foreign missions are anxious about the deteriorating economic 
conditions, while domestic political actors are disappointed 
by the lack of meaningful dialogue between the government and 
Aung San Suu Kyi.  While there is nothing unusual about this 
-- political despair and economic anxiety are almost chronic 
conditions in Rangoon -- nevertheless, the reports the Troika 
received during this visit will leave them with little 
latitude in regard to policy recommendations. So far as we 
can see (and barring any dramatic developments over the next 
few weeks), Burma will have to live with the EU\'s common 
position as it is right now. End Comment.

SUBJECT: ROHINGYA REFUGEE UPDATE 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Government of Burma has unofficially 
told UNHCR that it would accept 5,000 of the remaining 
22,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.  That would leave a 
residual 17,000 people in Bangladesh to be locally settled 
or otherwise accommodated.  UNHCR Rohingya repatriation 
assistance will cease as of June 30, 2003.  40,000 potential 
asylum seekers from Burma\'s Chin state are presently in 
India\'s Mizoram state.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Hitoshi Mise, the UNHCR\'s deputy director for the 
EAP region, briefed the diplomatic corps in Rangoon June 18 
on his discussions with the GOB about Rohingya refugees. 
Mise said he found the Deputy Minister of Immigration 
\"unusually flexible\" and secured GOB agreement on three 
logistical issues regarding Rohingya refugee repatriation. 
The Deputy Minister, speaking off the record, told UNHCR 
that the GOB would consider accepting up to 5,000 of the 
22,000 refugees still in Bangladesh. 
 
3.  (SBU) Mise noted that this would leave some 17,000 
Rohingyas in Bangladesh.  He said UNHCR might have to re- 
verify their refugee status, as many of the individuals left 
Burma in 1991 or 1992.  Local settlement in Bangladesh might 
be a likely prospect for the residual 17,000, Mise mused 
aloud, while noting he planned to travel to Dhaka shortly to 
discuss these issues with the Government of Bangladesh. 
 
4. (SBU) The governments of Burma and Bangladesh have agreed 
that UNHCR repatriation assistance to Rohingya refugees 
would cease on June 30, 2003, Mise reported.  UNHCR reps 
added that the resettlement assistance programs for the 
232,000 returned Rohingya refugees would continue beyond 
that date. 
 
5.  (SBU) UNHCR representatives at the briefing reported 
that some 40,000 dislocated people from Chin state are 
currently in Mizoram.  As the UNHCR has no presence in 
Mizoram (individuals seeking refugee status must apply in 
New Delhi) and with the Mizo/Zomi ethnic group straddling 
the India - Burma border, Mise said it is very difficult for 
these folks to establish refugee status.  Resident UNHCR 
head Rajiv Kapur commented that the numbers of Burmese 
applying for refugee status in New Delhi are small but 
growing (about 700 over the last three months).  He also 
commented that the official residence of Indian Defense 
Minister George Fernandes is currently being used to house 
large numbers of displaced Burmese.

SUBJECT: RUMORED PROMOTIONS IN THE SPDC 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  News services are reporting that the State 
Peace and Development Council has promoted some of its top 
generals.  Although the SPDC has not officially announced the 
promotions, rumors in Rangoon appear to indicate that at 
least four of the top Generals may have been promoted.  If 
true, the promotions would be a further consolidation of 
power by Senior General Than Shwe, ensuring control over his 
top echelons.  It is too early to judge whether this 
consolidation of power would indicate that the Senior General 
is positioning for continued military control of the country 
or if he may be setting the stage for a transition to 
civilian government. End Summary. 
 
2. (C)  Information provided by Embassy contacts appears to 
support reports by Kyodo News and the BBC that the SPDC has 
promoted some of its top brass.  Although the SPDC has not 
announced any promotions, rumors in Rangoon indicate that at 
least four of the senior brass may have been promoted; 
General Maung Aye has been promoted to Deputy Senior General, 
Lt. General Khin Nyunt has been promoted to General, and two 
Major Generals, Thura Shwe Mann and Kyaw Win, have been 
promoted to Lt. Generals.  If these promotions are confirmed, 
they will indicate a consolidation of power by Senior General 
Than Shwe.  Promoting Maung Aye to Deputy Senior General ( a 
position that has never existed before) will end speculation 
on possible jockeying for position between he and Lt. General 
Khin Nyunt.  Promoting Khin Nyunt to General, reportedly with 
duties as \"Military Advisor,\" will move him up from his 
traditional role as head of the country\'s infamous Military 
Intelligence.  This may help make him more palatable with the 
international community as a regime interlocutor and put to 
rest doubts about any lingering allegiance to his mentor, 
ex-strongman General Ne Win.  Kyaw Win will presumably take 
up Khin Nyunt\'s old position as intelligence chief and Thura 
Shwe Mann, who is now Chief of Staff - Army, may move up into 
Maung Aye\'s position of Deputy Commander in Chief of Defense 
Services.  Both of these Generals are stalwart Than Shwe 
supporters.  Their positions just below Maung Aye and Khin 
Nyunt will keep the latter focused on supporting the Senior 
General.  If there are any weaknesses, they will know they 
could easily be replaced. 
 
Comment 
 
3. (C)  Again these promotions are still just rumors at this 
point.  If they are verified, they are clearly an effort by 
Senior General Than Shwe to consolidate his position and 
control.  It is still too early to judge, however, whether 
these moves would indicate his desire to perpetuate military 
control of the country or perhaps move slowly toward some 
form of civilian control.  There is speculation that the SPDC 
will have to do something soon to mitigate international 
criticism that it has stalled on progress toward dialogue 
with the NLD.  This consolidation may be part of a strategy 
to defray this criticism.  That strategy, if it exists, is 
not yet clear to Rangoon observers.

it awaits both UNDP board and Burmese government approval for

Assistant Resident Representative David Dallah told us that 
in the upcoming year the UNDP here would focus on carrying 
out existing grassroots programs, and implementing 
agricultural and socio-economic assessments that the board 
approved in concept last year. 
 
3. (SBU) Ms. Suzaki and Mr. Dallah repeated their complaint 
(see Ref B) that the UNDP is unable to work efficiently here 
because of its mandate\'s restrictions regarding cooperation 
with government authorities.  They said that the recent UN 
review of UNDP\'s Burma activities concluded that the UNDP\'s 
Human Development Initiative (HDI) program here would be far 
more cost effective if it were able to take advantage of 
technical and professional staff resident in various Burmese 
government ministries.  The UNDP representatives also said 
that there are difficulties in coordinating actions with 
other UN agencies which are permitted to work with and 
through host government officials. 
 
4. (SBU) Though it does not plan to raise the matter during 
board discussions of Burma, the UNDP is considering 
preparation of a macroeconomic study aimed at advising the 
GOB on ties between economic reform and poverty reduction. 
This is a regional UNDP program, which the agency is 
currently carrying out in China, Cambodia, Vietnam, 
Bangladesh, Nepal, and Indonesia.  The idea is to complete a 
case study and then proffer policy recommendations to the 
government, with the aim of building capacity within the 
government and local \"think tanks.\"  Though the UNDP 
representatives stressed that this program was not conceived 
locally, we expect that the UNDP office here asked 
headquarters to include Burma in this regional program. 
 
Obstructionist \"Shining Star\" Sees the Light 
 
5. (C) The newly appointed liaison for UNDP and UNICEF 
activities, Minister for National Planning and Economic 
Development U Soe Tha, is apparently easing his initial 
bureaucratic stance toward UNDP projects.  U Soe Tha assumed 
the UNDP portfolio in July 2002 (Ref A) at the expense of the 
creative and more economically savvy Brigadier General David 
Abel.  According to UNDP staff here, after a rocky start the 
relationship with U Soe Tha has improved markedly.  Though 
the Minister has not yet approved UNDP\'s activities for the 
upcoming year, UNDP representatives are optimistic and 
pleased that the Minister and his staff have become more 
responsive.  The UNDP officials believe that someone higher 
in the food chain has encouraged U Soe Tha to show progress, 
and quickly. 
 
6. (C) Comment: We think it unnecessary to raise during the 
UNDP board\'s Burma deliberations the matter of U Soe Tha\'s 
administration of UNDP\'s activities.  However, it might be 
useful to urge the Burmese government to act promptly on 
approval of UNDP\'s country projects.  UNDP staff here said 
that a more aggressive intervention would have been welcome 
in July, but now, they fear, any pointed criticism could have 
negative consequences.  We will continue to monitor this 
evolving relationship, especially as it impacts UNDP\'s 
efforts to work with Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD.  End 
comment.

REF: RANGOON 1053 
 
Classified By: DCM RONALD MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Premier Oil\'s decision to pull up stakes here 
seems based more on financial necessity than the pressure of 
boycotts.  Petronas, Premier\'s partial owner and business 
partner in Burma, agreed to sell back its shares in Premier 
in exchange for the British firm\'s position in the Yetagun 
gas field, worth about $150 million.  This makes eminent 
sense considering the Malaysian state-run oil firm\'s desire 
to solidify its already influential position in Burma\'s up- 
and down-stream energy markets.  End summary. 
 
Premier\'s Loss, Petronas\' Gain 
 
2. (SBU) Premier Oil\'s announcement on September 15 that it 
would sell its shares in the offshore Yetagun gas field came 
as no surprise to local energy industry sources.  According 
to one western oil man, Premier, a relatively small 
independent energy producer, had \"bitten off more than it 
could chew\" in operating the Yetagun field.  He speculated 
that Premier\'s operating partners -- notably Malaysia\'s 
Petronas and Thailand\'s PTT -- were increasingly unhappy with 
the way Premier was operating the field.  In addition, 
difficulties working with the local government increased the 
operating costs of the Yetagun field. 
 
3. (SBU) These comments tally with Premier\'s assertion that 
it liquidated its position here to reduce overall company 
debt levels, to focus on other core investments, and to rid 
itself of the 25 percent foreign ownership (by Malaysia\'s 
Petronas and Amerada-Hess from the United States) that had 
made outside acquisition -- a stated Premier objective -- 
unlikely.  Industry sources here say that the complexities of 
unwinding Premier\'s investment, and the transfer of 
operations to Petronas, will likely keep the British firm 
here until after November. 
 
4. (SBU) Petronas was more than happy to buy out its 
erstwhile partner.  The Malaysian energy parastatal will 
become the field\'s operator after absorbing Premier\'s 26.7 
percent share in Yetagun, upping to nearly 60 percent 
Petronas\' total stake in the $600 million investment.  This 
acquisition fits well with other evidence that Petronas is 
here for the long haul.  Aside from holding a majority stake 
in Yetagun, Petronas also recently inked understandings with 
the Burmese government to survey and possibly develop 4 
blocks near the Yetagun field. 
 
5. (SBU) Petronas is also heavily involved in the downstream 
side of the energy game here in Burma, despite the economic 
hazards.  A top-level Petronas official told us that the 
company has, for four years, held the sole supply contract of 
petroleum and diesel fuel oil for the Ministry of Gas and 
Energy -- though the military\'s Myanmar Economic Holdings 
Limited also imports quantities of diesel fuel for domestic 
consumption.  This $200 million a year deal is paid 50 
percent cash and 50 percent in agricultural products, with a 
year\'s credit for all payments.  These are extremely generous 
terms, considering the Burmese government\'s chronic foreign 
exchange shortage.  Nevertheless, Petronas has made them work 
out, at least thus far. 
 
Government\'s Reaction: Huh? 
 
6. (C) One sad anecdote, which speaks volumes of the 
country\'s dismal investment climate, came during a courtesy 
call to the Ministry of National Planning and Economic 
Development\'s Directorate for Investment and Company 
Administration -- the main contact for foreign investors. 
During the course of our conversation with the Deputy 
Director General we asked for the government\'s reaction to 
the news reports of Premier\'s decision.  Blank, embarrassed, 
stares indicated that the news of the $150 million investment 
shuffle had not yet trickled down to the office which must 
\"approve\" such decisions. 
 
Comment 
 
7. (C) We think the international divestment lobby played no 
more than an incidental role in Premier\'s decision.  From all 
we have heard, it was simply a business move.  On the other 
hand, the transfer of Premier\'s assets to Petronas will add 
to the substantial stake that Malaysia (through Petronas) has 
already established in Burma\'s energy sector.  It is now 
Burma\'s major oil product supplier as well as one of the 
largest investors in Burma\'s offshore gas fields.  As others 
have chosen to shy away from Burma, Malaysia has bought in 
and has now solidified a position that should give it 
significant influence for years to come.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMESE INVESTMENT CLIMATE STILL HOSTILE 
 
This cable is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
 1. (U) As a companion to the recently submitted Burma 
investment climate statement, we want to summarize the key 
problems that plague the country.  The full text of the 
investment climate statement will be posted on the National 
Trade Data Bank and is available via email from 
wohlauerbv@state.gov. 
 
2. (SBU)  New U.S. investment in Burma has been illegal since 
1997.  Burma is a country blessed with extensive natural 
resources, low labor costs, and a great potential for 
tourism.  It is also an ASEAN member.  However, even if 
sanctions were removed, an extraordinarily hostile investment 
climate would hold U.S. investment -- as it has held all 
other investment -- to a very low level.  In Burma\'s FY 
2001-02, flows of investment dropped nearly 90 percent from 
the previous fiscal year to only $17.46 million for seven 
projects. 
 
3. (SBU) Burma\'s investment laws are relatively liberal, but 
their implementation is racked, at all levels, with 
corruption.  The ruling military junta, the State Peace and 
Development Council (SPDC), has promised an \"open door\' 
economic policy and urged foreign firms to invest, but 
regularly comes out with punitive and capricious regulations, 
which make investment for foreigners difficult if not 
possible.  The regulations are so vague and so conflicting 
that it is almost impossible for an investor to be fully 
confident that it is doing business \"legally.\" 
 
4. (SBU) Some lowlights of the past year: (1) an oral 
directive forbidding renewal of existing trading permits, or 
issuance of new ones, for foreign firms; (2) a increasing 
disparity between the official exchange rate (6 kyat to the 
dollar) and the market rate (1300 to the dollar and falling); 
(3) continuing restrictions on the use of foreign exchange 
for imports unless the imports are matched by exports; (4) 
government expropriation of a foreign firm without 
compensation; and, (5) increasing consumer boycotts in the 
United States and Europe on products made in Burma. 
 
5. (SBU) Barring significant practical change, we do not 
expect Burma\'s investment climate to improve.  We have not 
seen any movement toward reform in recent years and expect 
none in the immediate future.  In fact, if recent events are 
any indication, the situation for investors will most likely 
deteriorate in the period immediately ahead.

SUBJECT: REGIME FEEDS ON ITS OWN 
 
REF: RANGOON 602 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  On September 26, the regime sentenced 
ex-dictator General Ne Win\'s son-in-law and three grandsons 
to death by hanging for attempted treason.  The son-in-law, 
one of the grandsons, and some business associates were also 
sentenced to varying lengths of hard labor for economic 
crimes.  The verdicts culminate highly publicized trials that 
began in early May.  A lack of hard evidence did not appear 
to hinder the court, and most believe the attack on the Ne 
Win family was orchestrated to quash any doubts about Senior 
General Than Shwe\'s ultimate authority in Burma.  Most 
observers believe the Senior General will now step in to 
commute the death sentences, balancing his display of 
strength with one of compassion.  However, there is the 
possibility that the four will indeed be hanged.  The general 
public views the whole affair as a power play between the 
elite, with little or no bearing on their daily lives.  End 
Summary. 
 
Guilty On All Counts... 
 
2. (SBU)  The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) 
handed down death sentences for high treason to the 
son-in-law and three grandsons of ex-strongman General Ne Win 
in a hearing on September 26.  Culminating trials that began 
in early May (reftel), the hearing, which was open to family 
members, journalists, and diplomats, lasted from early 
morning into the evening as the judges summarized evidence 
that the four men had conspired to overthrow the government 
and illegally imported cars and cellular telephones.  The 
first phase of the hearing summarized evidence of economic 
crimes by grandson Kyaw Ne Win, a locally renowned gang 
leader and thug, son-in-law Aye Zaw Win, and a handful of 
their local business partners.  For these crimes, Kyaw Ne Win 
received 49 years of hard labor, while the others received 
lesser sentences of hard labor. 
 
3. (SBU)  The second phase of the trial listed evidence of 
high treason against the grandsons and son-in-law, focusing 
primarily on the testimony of a military officer, a letter 
from the son-in-law to the court appealing for mercy (which 
was interpreted as an admission of guilt), and items seized 
from the houses and businesses of the four such as radios, 
flashlights, and guard uniforms.  Although the evidence 
appeared weak, the judge sentenced the four to death by 
hanging for attempting to seize State power and life 
imprisonment for enticing the military to betray the State. 
(Note:  We have been told that, bizarrely, in verdicts 
entailing death and life imprisonment, the hangman\'s rope is 
removed from the corpse and kept in prison to serve the life 
sentence after the execution.  End Note.) 
 
4. (SBU)  Although family members in attendance cried as the 
verdicts were announced the four defendants appeared resigned 
to their fate.  When told they had seven days to file an 
appeal, the father brusquely stated, \"if the State wants to 
kill us, we will not fight it,\" and the boys nodded their 
agreement.  It is up to the Supreme Court to set the date and 
time of the executions.  The wife and mother of the 
defendants, Ne Win\'s formerly powerful daughter Sanda Win, is 
reportedly still under house arrest with the ex-strongman at 
the family\'s lakeside compound.  We have no information yet 
on how she or Ne Win reacted to the verdicts. 
 
5. (SBU)  Comment:  The verdicts have generated only mild 
public interest in Burma.  While there is no love lost for 
the Ne Win clan, most average Burmese see the trial and 
verdicts as the end of a struggle among the elite, which will 
have little or no effect on their lives.  With economic 
conditions continuing to spiral downward and prices 
skyrocketing, most citizens are focusing on their next meal 
rather than the travails of the power elite.  Among our 
contacts, most do not believe the regime will carry out the 
death sentences.  The arrest and trial of the family members 
have already demonstrated the regime\'s power and its 
intolerance of dissent, even among those previously 
considered \"untouchables.\"  In this view, the Senior General 
could now demonstrate his compassion by commuting the death 
sentences and leaving the four to serve life sentences.  A 
minority view is that with the publicity attached to the 
public trial and verdicts, the Senior General must let the 
sentences stand to demonstrate that the military is resolute 
in its undertakings. End Comment.

SUBJECT: IMF: TAKE YOUR ADVICE AND... 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: IMF proposals for marginal economic reforms 
in Burma have been brushed aside by the government.  Japanese 
efforts to stimulate interest in reform in return for limited 
adjustment aid will likely get a similarly cold reception. 
Nonetheless, international financial bodies and donor 
community experts should maintain contacts.  They need to 
rebuild their knowledge of the Burmese economy.  They also 
need to continue their economic education of the Burmese 
technocrats who will one day be called on to administer an 
economically viable state.  End summary. 
 
Show Me the Money 
 
2. (C) Traditionally the IMF\'s suggestions for incremental 
economic reform fall on deaf ears here.  We understand that 
the IMF will once again propose that the Burmese government 
take marginal steps to: (1) begin to unify the market and 
official exchange rates, (2) liberalize agricultural exports, 
(3) improve tax collection, and (4) improve state-owned 
enterprises\' budgetary discipline.  Although the IMF\'s report 
of its July mission to Burma is not yet published, already 
the word is that the Burmese government will ignore its 
proposals.  The official line of the Burmese government has 
long been that no economic reforms will be possible without a 
large structural adjustment loan.  The IMF, restricted by 
U.S. policy from extending new funding to Burma, has 
repeatedly tried to convince the naysayers in Rangoon to 
undertake limited, incremental reform measures that would not 
require a large financial investment. 
 
3. (C) A top Burmese businessman and former government 
finance official said the regime was unlikely to shift its 
position any time soon.  He said that the ruling generals are 
fixated on national pride.  The government will dismiss all 
IMF or World Bank advice as long as those institutions 
\"patronize\" Burma and refuse to treat it like a full member 
-- that is by giving it access to funding.  He admitted that 
the Ministry of Finance had discussed repaying its 
International Financial Institution (IFI) arrears as a \"sign 
of good faith,\" but ultimately rejected the notion on the 
grounds that the gesture would not result in any new loans 
coming Burma\'s way. 
 
Japan, Asia\'s Answer to the IMF 
 
4. (C) The Japanese government is also getting in on the 
economic advice game.  A large team of technical consultants 
and scholars has been regularly visiting from Tokyo to work 
with Burmese government officials on economic reform.  One of 
the team\'s leaders, a professor of international studies from 
Yokohama, told us that the Japanese government has had some 
success in the region in the past where the IMF has failed, 
getting Vietnam to accept conditionality for a 20 billion yen 
bilateral economic adjustment loan.  Ideally, the team leader 
claimed, the Japanese government would like to arrange for 
Prime Minister Koizumi and Senior General Than Shwe to sign 
off on a similar structural adjustment loan agreement during 
the upcoming ASEAN leaders meeting in Cambodia. 
 
5. (C) The team leader was not optimistic that the current 
Burmese regime would adopt economic reform measures. 
However, he was concerned that if no effort was made to push 
reform, and to support the few reform-minded technocrats 
here, then any new democratic government would inherit a 
country with very dim economic prospects.  He felt that such 
support would only be possible through a carefully monitored 
and disbursed structural adjustment loan.  Further sanctions 
or economic isolation, he posited, would sound a death knell 
for budding reformers. 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C) No one is surprised that the ruling junta scoffs at 
the IMF proposals.  Despite this, we think that the U.S. 
government should encourage IMF and World Bank technical 
missions to Burma, as long as they are not tied to any new 
funding.  Even if the government will not listen to reason, 
at least these IFIs can rebuild their knowledge base with a 
view to providing critically necessary adjustment funding 
quickly when and if a political change occurs.  Likewise we 
think the Japanese should continue with their efforts. 
Although we are dubious that the government will listen to 
Japan any more than it will to the IMF, it is important for 
communication to continue between Burma and donors on issues 
of economic reform.  End comment.

SUBJECT: STRONG ETHNIC SHOWING AT NLD\'S 14TH ANNIVERSARY 
 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Amidst strong support from Western 
diplomats and ethnic representatives the NLD celebrated its 
14th anniversary on September 27 in downtown Rangoon.  NLD 
leaders called for the SPDC to enter into dialogue without 
delay for the benefit of the country.  An array of leaders 
from ethnic parties pledged to continue working hand in hand 
with the NLD.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The NLD celebrated its 14th anniversary on September 
27 with a ceremony at its headquarters in downtown Rangoon. 
Approximately 500 people attended the ceremony, including NLD 
members, ethnic party leaders, Ambassadors from the United 
States, Australia, Britain, France, and Germany, staff from 
the Indian, Japanese, and Norwegian embassies (ASEAN 
countries were notably absent), the WHO country 
representative, UNICEF staff, and local press. 
 
3. (SBU) NLD General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi gave a brief 
keynote address saying that on her recent trips around the 
country she has seen that people lack security.  She stated 
that the SPDC should not try to break the people but work for 
their benefit and the benefit of the country.  On a 
conciliatory note, she said that the NLD wants to work for 
the \"national cause,\" calling on the SPDC to join hands with 
the NLD to enjoy the fruits of democracy. 
 
4. (SBU) NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo then read a lengthy 
statement recounting the origins of the party in 1988 and 
what it stood for then and still stands for today i.e., that 
sovereignty descends from the people, that human dignity is 
not to be crushed under foot, that free and fair elections 
must be held, that the rights of minorities must be 
respected, and that there must be equality before the law. 
He then gave a brief historical overview of the 1990 
elections, the SLORC\'s \"failure to honor\" the election 
results, and subsequent problems with the National 
Convention. He noted that it is imperative to have a 
practicing democracy to solve the political, economic, 
social, educational, and health problems of Burma and 
challenged the SPDC to work together with the NLD for the 
benefit of the people. 
 
5. (SBU) Turning up the heat just a little, U Tin Oo recalled 
that upon ASSK\'s release in May the SPDC declared that it was 
\"opening a new historic page,\" noting that these words can 
only be meaningful if there is dialogue between the SPDC and 
NLD.  He clarified that there has been no dialogue yet, 
neither a \"defacto\" dialogue nor a \"low-level\" dialogue, and 
said the SPDC must have the will to engage in dialogue.  He 
called for the release of all political prisoners \"without 
any further delay\" and said the NLD\'s policies on the results 
of the 1990 election, the National Convention which started 
in 1993, the drawing of the National Constitution, foreign 
investment, and tourism will remain unchanged until there is 
substantive and meaningful dialogue. 
 
6. (SBU) The leaders of virtually all prominent, and some 
obscure, ethnic political parties were in attendance and 
several took the podium to read letters of felicitation and 
to pledge their support to the NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi. 
Leaders from the Shan State Kokang Democratic Party, the 
United Nationalities League for Democracy, the Mon National 
Democratic Front, the Kamans National League for Democracy, 
the United Nationalities Alliance, and the 23 Veterans group 
read letters of support for the NLD.  Sitting with the NLD 
Central Executive Committee were leaders from the Mon, Zomi 
(Chin), Arakan, Shan, Karen, Kachin, and Karenni parties 
represented in the 1990 elections.  U Aye Tha Aung, the 
Arakan League for Democracy leader who serves as Secretary on 
the Committee Representing the Peoples\' Parliament, was also 
in attendence. 
 
7. (C)  Comment:  The NLD, and particularly Aung San Suu Kyi, 
continued to call for political progress in a 
non-confrontational manner.  They noted the urgent need for 
political change to address growing problems in the country 
without putting the blame on the SPDC for the deteriorating 
conditions.  Unfortunately, it does not look like the 
non-confrontational approach is bearing fruit, and it will be 
difficult to sustain over the long run without some progress. 
 Clearly the most significant aspect of the ceremony was the 
support shown by the ethnic parties.  Not only did they show 
up in force at the event, they publicly stated that they are 
working hand in hand with the NLD and would continue to do 
so.  This strengthens the NLD\'s claim that it enjoys the 
support of the ethnic groups.  Whether it works to encourage 
or discourage the SPDC to enter into dialogue, time will 
tell.  End Comment.

REF: TOKYO 5480 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Japanese Ambassador Yuji Miyamoto delivered a 
message from Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi when he 
presented his credentials to Than Shwe on September 16. 
According to sources at the Japanese Embassy, Miyamoto also 
went into some detail about political transition, Japanese 
aid, and economic reform in Burma. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Japanese Aid: Koizumi\'s letter made three points.  It 
reaffirmed the historic friendship between Japan and Burma; 
it emphasized the importance of motion towards democracy; and 
it reiterated Foreign Minister Kawaguchi\'s offer to give 
special consideration to any aid projects that were agreed 
between the NLD and the government.  According to Koizumi\'s 
letter, such projects would be handled \"outside normal 
channels,\" meaning that they would be approved and funded at 
no cost to Japan\'s normal aid budget in Burma.  Such projects 
would be, according to the letter, a pure bonus for the 
country. 
 
3. (C) Economic Reform: The Ambassador, on his own, raised 
economic reform issues.  He noted that Japan was finalizing 
its report on Structural Adjustment in Burma and asked Than 
Shwe to consider reading it in full.  Than Shwe simply nodded 
at that suggestion. 
 
4. (C) Political Transition: Than Shwe told the Ambassador 
that the GOB was committed to democratization.  However, he 
made no promises regarding the pace or timetable for change. 
Rather, he emphasized that national unity, education, and 
economic development had to come before democracy.  Burma had 
failed in the past, he argued, because it had not been ready 
for western-style democracy.  He wanted to be sure this time 
that it did not fail again. 
 
5. (C) Comment: Miyamoto made good use of his time with Than 
Shwe, delivering messages that need to get through, but which 
rarely reach Than Shwe.  The Japanese have also obviously 
done some thinking about the best way to encourage 
cooperation between the government and the NLD.  Hence, the 
offer of aid on basically no-cost terms. End Comment.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY: THIRTY PEOPLE, INCLUDING SEVERAL 
RELATIVELY WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL ACTIVISTS AND AT 
LEAST ONE FORMER NLD MEMBER, WERE ARRESTED IN 
RANGOON ON SEPTEMBER 25.  IT IS NOT CLEAR YET WHAT 
CHARGES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST THE THIRTY.  THERE 
ARE HINTS, HOWEVER, THAT THESE ARRESTS MAY BE PART 
OF A MORE GENERAL SWEEP FOR ACTIVISTS IN RANGOON. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) THE STATE PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL 
(SPDC) ARRESTED ABOUT THIRTY BURMESE ACTIVISTS IN 
RANGOON ON SEPTEMBER 25. RELIABLE SOURCES HAVE 
CORROBORATED THE ARRESTS AND REPORTED THAT MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE CONFISICATED SOME PUBLICATIONS FROM THE 
RESIDENCES OF THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED.  INCLUDED 
AMONG THE PEOPLE ARRESTED WERE SEVEN RELATIVELY 
WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL ACTIVISTS: ZAW PHAY WIN, YE 
KYAW SWA, HLA HTUT SOE, U MYINT, YIN MAUNG, NE WIN 
AND LWIN KO MAUNG. ZAW PHAY WIN HAS BEEN ARRESTED 
SEVERAL TIMES SINCE 1988 AND WAS OPERATING A WELL- 
KNOWN PRIVATE TUTORING SERVICE IN DOWNTOWN RANGOON. 
FIVE OF ZAW PHAY WIN\'S COLLEAGUES FROM THE TUTORING 
SERVICE WERE ALSO AMONG THOSE ARRESTED.  YE KYAW SWA 
AND HLA HTUT SOE ARE OLD STUDENT ACTIVISTS WHO WERE 
JAILED FROM 1989-94, AND THEN AGAIN IN 1996. SOME OF 
THE ARRESTED ACTIVISTS WERE REPORTED TO BE CONNECTED 
TO THE UNION OF BURMA DEMOCRATIC FRONT (UBDF), A 
DEFUNCT POLITICAL PARTY ASSOCIATED WITH MOE THEZUN, 
WHO WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR NEW 
SOCIETY (DPNS).  U MYINT WAS A FORMER NLD MEMBER. 
 
3. (SBU) THESE ARRESTS MAY BE PART OF A CONTINUING 
SWEEP FOR ACTIVISTS IN RANGOON. THERE WERE ALSO 
REPORTS IN RANGOON ON SEPTEMBER 29 THAT SEVERAL 
MONKS HAD BEEN ARRESTED.  IN ADDITION, SINCE EARLY 
SEPTEMBER, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTEDLY BEEFED UP 
NIGHTTIME, HOUSE-TO-HOUSE CHECKS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
UNREGISTERED OVERNIGHT GUESTS. IN BURMA, FAILING TO 
REGISTER SUCH GUESTS IS ITSELF A CRIME.

SUBJECT: BURMESE GOVERNMENT REPORTS TO THE USG ON 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  The GOB is prepared to act on human 
trafficking, but has not put together programs that will 
fully treat the problem.  In a report presented to the 
Embassy in August, the GOB acknowledges the problem facing 
Burma and lays out the legislative, enforcement, training, 
and preventive measures it has taken to deal with 
trafficking.  Unfortunately, the report is incomplete, with 
little discussion of such key issues as the GOB\'s funding of 
anti-trafficking activities, its cooperation with destination 
countries, and its handling of repatriated victims of 
trafficking.  Our conclusion: our message on trafficking has 
gotten through.  The GOB is concerned and is prepared to act, 
but has not put together programs that are anywhere near 
commensurate with the scale of the problem here.  End Summary. 
 
Political Commitment 
 
2. (SBU) According to the GOB report, Burma is committed to 
dealing with trafficking.  It established the Myanmar 
National Committee on Women\'s Affairs (MNCWA) in 1996 
following the Fourth World Conference on Women and assigned 
that committee responsibility for trafficking issues in 
Burma.  The Committee\'s patron is Secretary One Khin Nyunt, 
whose wife also serves as head of the Committee\'s Education 
Group.  MNCWA working committees have also been organized at 
the state, division, district, and township levels. 
According to the report, there are now 324 MNCWA township 
working committees in Burma; i.e., one in each of the 
nation\'s townships. 
 
National Plan of Action and National Initiative 
 
3. (SBU) MNCWA also adopted in 1997 a National Plan of Action 
for Trafficking in Women and Children.  That plan calls for 
an assessment of trafficking in Burma, formation of a 
national task force, a program of national workshops, 
training for concerned officials, rehabilitation of victims 
of trafficking, and the distribution of educational materials 
on trafficking.  In 2000, MNCWA adopted a National Initiative 
on the Trafficking of Women and Children, which includes 
preventive, protection, enforcement, prosecution, and 
reintegration strategies.  Copies of both documents are 
attached to the government\'s report. 
 
Legal Framework 
 
4. (SBU) There are no specific human trafficking laws in 
Burma, according to the report.  However, there are laws 
which can be applied in cases of trafficking.  These include 
the 1993 Child Law, which includes provisions against the 
sale, abuse, or exploitation of children; the 1949 
Suppression of Prostitution Act, which prohibits any efforts 
to force or entice a woman into prostitution; and the Penal 
Code which forbids kidnapping and any effort to \"convey any 
person beyond the limits of the Union of Myanmar without that 
person\'s consent.\"  The report also notes that the Supreme 
Court issued Directive No. 1/01 on February 2, 2001 regarding 
punishments for human traffickers.  Copies of the relevant 
laws are attached to the report. 
 
Monitoring the Borders 
 
5. (SBU) Burma\'s immigration and emigration controls are 
tight, according to the report.  On the Thai border alone, 
there are 23 checkpoints run by the Police, Immigration 
Supervisory Board, and the Customs Department.  During the 
period May 2000 to June 2002, the report states, 22,208 men, 
women, and children were prevented from crossing the border 
\"in order to prevent them from becoming involved in nefarious 
activities, including sexual exploitation.\"  Approximately 
9,000 of these people were women.  According to the report, 
no legal action was taken against any of those who were 
turned back; rather, they were counseled on the dangers of 
illegally working abroad and sent back to their homes.  The 
report also notes that women between the age of 16 to 25 are 
absolutely prohibited from crossing the border unless 
accompanied by a legal guardian. 
 
Law Enforcement 
 
6. (SBU) Many traffickers have also received long sentences. 
According to the report, between 1999 and July 2002, Burma\'s 
courts have given 104 human traffickers prison sentences 
ranging from 3 to 14 years. 
 
Preventive Measures 
 
7. (SBU) The GOB has put a special focus on education, 
according to the report.  Between 1999 and June 2002, 10,822 
village-level seminars were held by MNCWA and/or NGOs to 
educate poor families to the dangers of trafficking.  In Mon 
State, eastern Shan State, and Kayin State, these seminars 
were carried out in cooperation with the United Nations 
Inter-Agency Project on Trafficking in Women and Children in 
the Mekong Sub-region (UN-IAP). 
Protection of Victims 
8. (SBU) The report asserts that victims of trafficking are 
not treated as criminals.  It also states that there are 
rehabilitation centers, and Vocational Training Centers for 
Women in Yangon, Mandalay, Myeik, and Kengtung, and Women\'s 
Development Centers in Yangon and Mandalay.  According to the 
report, legal has been taken only against those found guilty 
of trafficking. 
 
Root Causes 
 
9. (SBU) The report argues that the main causes of 
trafficking are poverty and ignorance and marshals all of the 
government\'s statistics on development to demonstrate concern 
for those issues.  In particular, it notes that the 
government has established twelve training centers since 1992 
in towns adjacent to Burma\'s borders.  Altogether, these 
centers have provided vocational training to 10,128 girls and 
women over the past decade. 
 
International Cooperation 
 
10. (SBU) Burma is a signatory to the 1950 Convention for the 
Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and Exploitation of the 
Prostitution of Others.  It is also a party to the Convention 
on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, and to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In addition, the 
GOB has become a regular participant in regional and 
bilateral meetings on trafficking (15 in all) since 1997 and 
has cooperated with the UN-IAP on programs to raise awareness 
and build NGO and government capacity in regard to 
trafficking problems. 
 
Non-Governmental Organizations 
 
11. (SBU) According to the report, Burma has enlisted the 
support of NGOs like the Myanmar Red Cross Society, the 
Auxiliary Fire Brigade, the Myanmar Maternal and Child 
Welfare Association, and the Myanmar Women Entrepreneurs 
Association in the fight against trafficking.  As an example, 
it notes that the Maternal and Child Welfare Association has 
implemented a literacy campaign for 410,000 women in remote 
areas, conducted vocational classes, and extended 
micro-credit loans amounting to nearly 150 million kyat over 
the past decade. 
 
Embassy Assessment of the Report 
 
12. (SBU) The MOFA report is obviously intended to put the 
best face on the GOB\'s counter-trafficking efforts and is, 
unfortunately, packed with a variety of facts and figures 
from GOB programs that are, at best, tangentially related to 
the trafficking.  It is also short of some key statistics. 
While it provides more information than needed on the number 
of pencils and notebooks distributed under various programs, 
it does not provide any significant information on the 
resources that the GOB has specifically allocated to its 
program on human trafficking.  It also provides little 
information regarding the number of trafficking victims it 
has actually assisted or repatriated from neighboring 
countries.  In support of its claim that the Government is 
committed to the international fight against trafficking, it 
details the international meetings it has attended and 
agreements it has signed.  However, it fails to provide any 
significant information on its cooperation with Thailand or 
other destination countries.  Similarly, it provides a lot of 
very specific information on government-affiliated NGO 
programs for women, but does not even hint at any 
coordination with the international NGOs in Burma that are 
working on the issue. 
 
13. (SBU) Oddly, the report gives only passing mention to 
what we consider the most effective anti-trafficking activity 
in the country, the United Nations Inter-Agency Project 
(UN-IAP) on Trafficking in Women and Children in the Mekong 
Sub-region.  This small but active project has pushed hard 
for GOB inter-agency coordination and action on trafficking 
issues, and has created a program for multi-sectoral 
\"service-provider\" training (i.e., police, immigration, law, 
and social welfare workers, among others).  Since August 
2001, it has held three training workshops for 100 key 
personnel from the police, immigration, health, and education 
services.  The UN-IAP has also actively sought improved 
interaction among international NGOs, GOB personnel, regime 
affiliated NGOs, and others that need to be involved to 
effectively address human trafficking challenges in Burma. 
 
14. (SBU) In spite of these weaknesses, it is clear that the 
Government has focused more attention on trafficking in 
persons this year than it has in the past.  In what appears 
to be a direct response to the Embassy\'s Trafficking in 
Persons Report, the Government met with Embassy officials 
earlier this year to determine what is needed to comply with 
TIPS criteria.  Since these meetings, the Government has 
initiated an information campaign to highlight the perils of 
trafficking.  An MNCWA delegation, headed by Secretary One 
General Khin Nyunt\'s wife, has also conducted highly 
publicized visits to border regions to meet with women in an 
effort to discourage them from falling victim to unscrupulous 
traffickers.  The state-controlled press is also running 
almost daily stories on trafficking victims that authorities 
have intercepted, counseled, and returned to their families. 
 
15. (SBU) These activities are a step in the right direction. 
 They demonstrate that the Government is aware of the need to 
act against human trafficking, and they serve to heighten 
public awareness of the potential dangers of trafficking. 
However, they need to be further reinforced by effective 
action specifically targeted at traffickers.  Right now, many 
of the trafficking \"busts\" described in the newspapers appear 
to be of men and women who are simply attempting to migrate 
(albeit illegally) to Thailand, not trafficking victims. 
Reportedly, only a fraction of the illegal Burmese migrants 
to Thailand are trafficking victims, i.e., people who have 
been deceived, coerced, or forced into working conditions 
they did not choose.  The rest are simply happy to be there, 
and out of Burma, whatever their employment status. 
 
 
16. (SBU) Finally, the government\'s heavy-handed approach to 
interdicting all illegal migrants has the potential to 
actually drive people into the hands of traffickers.  This is 
particularly true of the government\'s ban on exit visas for 
women from 16 to 25 who are not accompanied by their legal 
guardian.  For such women, the only recourse is often a 
trafficker. 
 
17. (SBU) In short, it is apparent that the government is 
making an effort to address concerns about human trafficking. 
 MNCWA\'s national action plan is a good plan.  It is based on 
international models and we will continue to push the 
government to implement it.  However, the government\'s 
approach does have some rough edges.  It needs to be more 
tightly focused on traffickers specifically.  Other aspects 
of the approach need to be beefed up, particularly in regard 
to cooperation with destination countries and the 
repatriation and reintegration of victims.  Fortunately, 
UN-IAP and a few international NGOs are already working here 
and should prove important allies in bringing the government 
closer to a complete and effective response to its current 
problems with trafficking in persons.

SUBJECT: BURMA: BREADBASKET AND BASKET CASE 
 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Persistent reports of unrest at food 
warehouses and distribution points in Burma suggest the 
government ration system may be breaking down.  If true, then 
food problems will only become worse for Burma\'s poorest in 
coming months as inflation accelerates, the kyat continues 
its free-fall, and corruption corrodes the government\'s 
ability to deliver basic commodities at subsidized prices. 
End summary. 
 
Supply is Up, So is the Price 
 
2. (SBU) Burma does not have a food shortage.  While 
government statistics are always suspect, the information 
available suggests that Burma has consistently produced as 
much or more rice per capita as any other country in the 
world.  According to local numbers compiled by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Burma annually produces about 800 
pounds of rice per person, i.e., as much as Thailand, and 
more than either Vietnam or Bangladesh. 
 
3. (SBU) This year, Burma seems to be headed again for a 
relatively good rice crop.  While heavy rains have damaged 
crops in central Burma and in the Irrawaddy delta, Burma 
nevertheless appears headed for a wet season harvest that is 
roughly equivalent to last year\'s 15 million tons. 
 
4. (C) Stocks are also allegedly ample.  By government fiat, 
all rice merchants must retain a 120-250 bag surplus 
(depending on each merchant\'s sales volume) that the regime 
can order onto the market at a subsidized price through the 
Rice Millers Association.  In addition, government officials 
claim to have \"strategic\" reserves for use during national 
emergencies, though there are real questions as to how large 
those strategic stocks are -- or if they even exist. 
 
The Price of Tea in Burma 
 
5. (C) Despite this evidence of adequate supply, there have 
been persistent tales of hardship among poorer families and 
rumors of sporadic unrest at rice distribution centers across 
the country.  These appear to be the result of three primary 
problems.  The first is wage and price pressures generated by 
decades of bad economic management by the government.  Forty 
years of military rule has crippled economic activity, while 
the government has supported itself in recent years 
essentially with money printed at the Central Bank.  For 
workers, this translates into a combination of unemployment 
and inflation that has held down wages and boosted prices. 
Over the past 12 months, retail prices in Rangoon have 
increased by approximately 60 percent, while wages have 
remained stagnant.  Right now rice in the open market in 
Rangoon is going for 300 to 350 kyat per pyi (2.2 kilograms), 
while factory workers make on average only 300 to 500 kyat 
per day, government pensioners only 600 to 800 kyat per 
month, and an average laborer or street merchant perhaps 100 
to 200 kyat per day. 
 
6. (C) The second factor is a poorly functioning public 
ration system, which covers politically sensitive items like 
rice, cooking oil (imported palm oil from Malaysia), 
gasoline, and soap.  Whenever rice prices begin to rise, the 
government orders the Rice Millers Association to work with 
local township authorities to determine the amount of rice 
needed and then procure it at a subsidized price set by the 
central government.  The township authorities are then 
responsible for distribution at this below market price to 
local families. 
 
7. (C) However, even the government\'s subsidized prices 
(recently raised from 100 to 130 kyat per pyi for rice) are 
too high for some.  There is also no needs test; the ration 
is available to all citizens regardless of their economic 
circumstances.  Consequently, many who do not need the 
subsidized rice claim their ration anyway to resell on the 
open market, exhausting stocks.  Moreover, because 
distribution centers are disorganized in checking 
identification for disbursement of subsidized cooking oil, a 
blossoming industry has emerged for those who are able to get 
multiple rations to resell for a handsome profit.  Finally, 
supplies are uncertain thanks to corruption among the 
township authorities.  We have heard of two recent cases 
where the police arrested local authorities for lying about 
availability of subsidized rice so that they could resell it 
in bulk on the black market. 
 
8. (C) The third factor in the food problem is the obstacles 
to the domestic rice trade that the government imposes in an 
effort to stem the border trade in rice.  Earlier this 
summer, for instance, rice shipments from Magwe Division to 
northern Rakhine State were reportedly cut off entirely in an 
effort to stop cross-border sales to Bangladesh that are 
stimulated by the subsidized prices in Burma.  The result is 
local shortages, usually in the border regions adjacent to 
China, India, Bangladesh, and Thailand. 
 
Comment 
 
9. (C) The net result for the government of this system of 
rations, subsidies, and trade barriers is a highly 
politicized food distribution system that could backfire as 
inflation continues to rise, and truly steep differentials 
emerge between open market and subsidized prices.  Thus far, 
only the poorest in Burma have suffered very much.  However, 
if the system does break down and the government does find 
itself incapable of keeping its implicit promise to deliver 
food at \"reasonable prices,\" especially in the major urban 
areas, then real trouble could result.  The government is 
gambling that it can maintain control of the ration system 
until the wet season harvest in October and November.  If as 
predicted the harvest is adequate, then the simple increased 
availability of food should put a damper on rice price 
pressures for a few months.  However, if the harvest is below 
expectations, there could be more widespread difficulties. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: DOWNER PUSHES REFORM DURING VISIT TO RANGOON 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Australian Foreign Minister Downer told Than 
Shwe and Khin Nyunt that the GOB should move convincingly to 
open a political dialogue with the NLD \"within the next one 
to two weeks.\"  He also urged the government to free all 
political prisoners.  Khin Nyunt replied that he \"fully 
subscribed\" to Downer\'s views on the need for prompt action 
on political transition; however, neither he nor Than Shwe 
made any commitments regarding a timetable for dialogue or 
the release of political prisoners.  Aung San Suu Kyi 
welcomed Downer\'s visit (\"every bit of help was needed\"), but 
was resolutely skeptical about the GOB\'s plans for dialog. 
She told Downer that there was no dialog with the government 
and that she was not convinced that the GOB was committed to 
political change.  She was also skeptical about Australian 
aid initiatives, including the Australian human rights 
training program.  She was not opposed to assistance per se, 
provided it was \"transparent, accountable, and independently 
monitored.\"  However, she did object to any assistance whose 
\"nature and manner\" was determined by the government.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) Australian Ambassador Trevor Wilson told diplomats 
October 4 that Australian Foreign Minister Downer had been 
nervous about the public reaction to his decision to visit 
Burma, but left satisfied with the results of the visit.  He 
had come at the urging of UN Special Envoy Razali Ismail and 
wanted to convey Australia\'s views directly to Burma\'s 
leaders.  That plus the opportunity to form his own views 
about the situation in Burma made for a good visit. 
 
The Message 
 
3. (C) Downer conveyed the same message in separate meetings 
with Senior General Than Shwe, Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, 
Foreign Minister Win Aung, and Home Minister Tin Hlaing. 
Australia was concerned about the slow pace of political and 
economic change in Burma.  It was essential, he said, that 
Burma move as soon as possible (\"within one to two weeks\") on 
political reform and transition in a way that was convincing 
to the international community.  This basically meant 
substantive talks with the NLD on political transition.  It 
was also essential that Burma publicize those moves and 
supplement them with measures to establish good faith, 
basically through the release of all political prisoners. 
Downer predicted that such moves would have \"a big impact\" 
internationally, and would help restart foreign investment 
flows for Burma. 
 
4. (C) On the economy, Downer told both Than Shwe and Khin 
Nyunt that Burma had to adapt to globalization; it could not 
cut itself off from the world.  It needed technocrats to run 
the economy and assistance to deal with its many humanitarian 
problems.  Political transition, however, was the key.  If it 
did not move forward on political transition, it would not 
get the support it needed from the world community. 
 
Secretary One 
 
SIPDIS 
 
5. (C) In reply, Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt told Downer that he 
\"fully subscribed\" to Downer\'s views about taking steps to 
show that the process of political transition was on track. 
He also stated that that he believed it was essential that 
the GOB cooperate with UN Special Envoy Razali, UN Special 
Rapporteur Pinheiro, and the ILO.  However, neither he nor 
Senior General Than Shwe made any commitments to Downer 
regarding the timing of any steps in regard to political 
transition.  Neither did any member of the government make 
any commitments regarding the release of political prisoners. 
 
6. (C) Khin Nyunt did claim that the dialog with the NLD was 
not stalled.  He also called Aung San Suu Kyi\'s shift to \"a 
more constructive approach\" a very positive step, one that 
had allowed the government and the NLD to deal with each 
other on a basis of mutual understanding \"like members of one 
family.\" 
 
Than Shwe 
 
7. (C) Than Shwe did not mention either the dialog or Aung 
San Suu Kyi.  However, he did emphasize that he did not want 
the military to remain in power forever, or ever again have 
to assume power in Burma.  That was not good for the either 
the country or the military.  Rather, he wanted to build a 
democratic system that would endure.  For Burma, that 
required national unity, education, and economic development. 
 Than Shwe did not respond to Downer\'s points regarding the 
economy, but also did not object to Downer\'s grim description 
of Burma\'s economic prospects, and did not ask for any type 
of Australian assistance. 
 
Home Minister Tin Hlaing 
 
8. (C) Downer told Home Minister Tin Hlaing that there was no 
reason for the GOB to hold any political prisoners and that 
he hoped that all would be released quickly.  He also told 
Tin Hlaing that Australia was very satisfied with its 
counternarcotics cooperation with Burma and had just decided 
to assign a second liaison officer from the Australian 
Federal Police to the Embassy in Rangoon.  Australia was also 
happy with its human rights training for Burmese police 
officers, but wanted to expand the program to include 
organizations like the NLD.  Tin Hlaing said that the GOB was 
\"prepared to consider that,\" however, according to Ambassador 
Wilson, details on the expanded program still have to be 
worked out. 
 
Aung San Suu Kyi 
 
9. (C) Aung San Suu Kyi told Downer that she was glad he had 
come.  \"Every bit of help was needed,\" she said, to move the 
GOB forward on political transition.  However, she stated 
categorically that no dialog was taking place with the 
government.  She also said that there had been no significant 
contacts between the GOB and the NLD, and that she was not 
convinced that the GOB was committed to the process of 
political change.  In regard to aid, she also told Downer 
that she was not opposed to any type of assistance for Burma, 
provided that assistance was \"transparent, accountable, and 
independently monitored.\"  However, she had reservations 
about any assistance provided to the government and \"would 
not support\" any assistance whose \"nature and manner\" was 
determined by the government.  She was also skeptical about 
the value of Australia\'s human rights training for the 
government.  Progress on human rights, she said, would depend 
on political change.  No amount of training could substitute 
for that.  She also said that she prefers a coordinated 
approach to aid; an approach that was coordinated among 
donors would have more impact on the GOB; it would also leave 
fewer \"loopholes\" for the government to exploit. 
 
Comment 
 
10. (C) It is hard to say what impact Downer\'s visit will 
have on the reform process here.  His comments regarding 
political transition, the economy, and the growing 
humanitarian problems in Burma were certainly on the mark. 
However, it is hard to tell how seriously the government took 
those remarks.  While Khin Nyunt asserted that he \"fully 
subscribed\" to Downer\'s views on the need for prompt and 
convincing motion in regard to political transition, Than 
Shwe did not take up that theme, nor did anyone else echo it. 
 As usual, we will simply have to wait and see whether there 
is any significant motion over the next several weeks. 
 
11. (C) The Australians\' initiative on human rights training 
for organizations \"like the NLD,\" and the Home Minister\'s 
response to that initiative, was also interesting.  It may be 
that the GOB is now ready to consider opening the doors 
somewhat in regard to involving the NLD in assistance 
programs, if only as recipients.  If true, even that would be 
a step forward, although the entire initiative still needs to 
be discussed with the NLD.  According to Ambassador Wilson, 
Downer did not discuss Australia\'s plans for the program with 
Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 
12. (C) Finally, it was gratifying to hear how direct Downer 
was with Than Shwe.  According to Ambassador Wilson, Khin 
Nyunt and Win Aung had both asked Downer to go easy on Than 
Shwe and not be so rude as Japanese Foreign Minister 
Kawaguchi in raising awkward issues.  To his credit, Downer 
ignored the GOB advice and followed Kawaguchi\'s example. 
Than Shwe needs to hear what Downer had to say and, in Post\'s 
view, it is good that Downer was willing to take the 
political risks and political heat associated with this visit 
in order to put his points across. End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The GOB is continuing its investigation of 
the Shan rape cases.  According to Brigadier General Kyaw 
Thein, a national intelligence team has investigated the 
first 71 of the 173 cases cited in the License to Rape report 
and so far found evidence of rape in five cases.  The other 
cases could not be substantiated, the Brigadier General 
claimed, at least on the basis of the information in the 
License to Rape report.  The team will reportedly complete 
investigations of all 173 cases over the next several months. 
 The team has given a copy of its preliminary report to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and encouraged MFA to brief UN 
Special Rapporteur Pinheiro on their findings.  We urged Kyaw 
Thein to share the report in its entirety with Pinheiro so 
that he could cross-check facts with sources in Thailand. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The GOB has continued its investigation of the Shan 
rape cases that were first described by the Shan Human Rights 
Foundation and the Shan Women\'s Action Network in their joint 
report, License to Rape.  According to Brigadier General Kyaw 
Thein, the GOB detailed a national intelligence team to look 
into all 173 cases outlined in the report.  Thus far, the 
team had completed the investigation of 71 cases.  Of those 
71, 5 appeared to reflect real cases of rape, Kyaw Thein 
commented.  The other 66 could not be substantiated, at least 
thus far, on the basis of the information in the \"License to 
Rape\" report.  Either the villages did not exist at the time 
the incidents were reported to have taken place, or the 
investigators were not able to trace the identities of the 
women who claimed to be victims. 
 
3. (C) The five cases that the team had been able to 
substantiate were cases number 55, 60, 3, 53, and 69 in the 
License to Rape report.  However, in each case, and 
particularly in regard to the last three cases, the facts 
were slightly different from those described in the report. 
 
Case No. 55 - The License to Rape report states that the 
SPDC\'s township officer, Captain Ant Maw raped a woman in her 
home in Murng Wee village in Nam Kham township of 
Northeastern Shan State.  According to the national 
intelligence team, Captain Ant Maw and the woman had lived 
together, but there was no rape.  Nevertheless, Captain Ant 
Maw was reprimanded for conduct unbecoming an officer and 
forced to retire. 
 
Case No. 60 - The License to Rape report states that Corporal 
Naing Htay from 324th Light Infantry Battalion raped a 
14-year-old invalid in Murng Yaen Village of Nam Tu township 
in Shan State in August 1998.  According to the national 
intelligence team, the culprit was a Lance Corporal Ton Naing 
of the 324th LIB, who was subsequently convicted of rape and 
sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with hard labor. 
 
Case No. 3 - The License to Rape report states that a soldier 
from the 333rd Light infantry Battalion raped a 26-year-old 
Lahu woman in Murng Sart township of Shan State in May 1992. 
According to the national intelligence team, there was a rape 
of a Lahu woman in that village by a Burmese Army soldier 
from the 333rd Light Infantry Battalion, but the rape 
occurred in April 1999, not May 1992.  The soldier\'s platoon 
leader paid compensation to the woman and no complaint was 
ever filed by the village.  The battalion did not report the 
incident and no action was ever taken against the soldier. 
 
Case No. 53 - The License to Rape report states that a 
soldier from Murng Ton raped a 29- year-old Lahu women in the 
Murng Ton area on July 16, 1998.  According to the national 
intelligence team, there is no record of a rape in 1998, but 
a private from the 277th Light Infantry Battalion raped a 
10-year-old Lahu girl in that area on April 17, 2002.  The 
soldier fled, but was shot dead while resisting arrest 
several days later. 
 
Case No. 69 - The License to Rape report states that two 
soldiers from the 225th Light infantry battalion raped a 
25-year-old woman in her home in Murng Ton township on 
November 21, 1998.  Again, there is no evidence of a rape in 
1998, but, according to the national intelligence team, on 
August 27, 1995, a private from the 255th LIB raped a 20 
year-old Palaung girl in Murng Ton township.  The private was 
convicted of rape and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment; his 
two accomplices were given three years each and his platoon 
leader was reprimanded for failing to maintain control of his 
men. 
 
4. (C) Brigadier Kyaw Thein said that the national 
intelligence team would look into the other 103 cases cited 
in the License to Rape report.  He also said that the team 
had given a copy of its preliminary report to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and had encouraged the Ministry to brief UN 
Special Rapporteur Pinheiro on their findings.  Poloff 
advised Brigadier Kyaw Thein that it would be best simply to 
give Pinheiro a copy of the report.  He could then 
cross-check the facts with sources in Thailand and get to the 
bottom of the 66 cases the GOB had not been able to 
substantiate, as well as the other 103 the GOB had yet to 
look into.  Kyaw Thein said that he would find out if that 
would be possible. 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C) The GOB told us on August 1 (ref A) that it was aware 
of 10 cases of rape involving soldiers in Shan and Kayah 
states.  (It is possible that not all of these were 
incorporated in the SHRF and SWAN report.)  On August 23, we 
witnessed the ludicrous GOB press conference in which the 
regime claimed that no soldiers were involved in rapes (ref 
B).  The October 7 update from Brigadier General Kyaw Thein 
-- one of the most credible and straight-forward Burmese 
military officers -- appears to indicate that the Burmese 
government finally recognizes that it has a serious human 
rights and public relations problem on its hands.  While the 
GOB seriously damaged the little credibility that it has with 
the international community at its press conference on August 
23, this ongoing investigation may herald an effort within 
the military to come to terms with this issue.  Instilling 
military discipline and justice, particularly in regard to 
non-combatants in a guerrilla war, is the key to rectifying 
this problem.  The upcoming Pinheiro visit may help in this 
regard, if the GOB takes steps to involve him in a process 
consistent with international standards (and credibility).

SUBJECT: ARAKAN ROHINGYA NATIONAL ORGANIZATION CONTACTS 
WITH AL QAEDA AND WITH BURMESE INSURGENT GROUPS ON THE THAI 
BORDER 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Under pressure from Bangladesh, the Arakan 
Rohingya National Organization (ARNO) contacted the Karenni 
National Progressive Party in late August 2002 regarding the 
possibility of relocating its bases to KNPP-controlled 
territory on the border between Thailand and Burma. According 
to a report prepared by Burmese military intelligence, ARNO 
also sought membership in the Democratic Alliance of Burma, a 
loose confederation of Burmese insurgent groups now operating 
on the Thai/Burmese border.   KNPP reportedly refused ARNO\'s 
request.  The DAB also rejected ARNO\'s application for 
membership, but has forged a \"military alliance\" with ARNO, 
according to the paper.  The Burmese also report that ARNO\'s 
Chairman Nurul Islam, has received a U.S. visa and is en 
route to the United States via Saudi Arabia.  The facts in 
the Burmese paper appear plausible.  Its purpose is probably 
to draw a connection between Al Qaeda, which has supported 
ARNO, and Burmese insurgent groups active on the Thai border. 
 End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The following are edited excerpts from a Burmese 
military intelligence report on the Arakan Rohingya National 
Organization.  It was given to us on October 7 by Brigadier 
General Kyaw Thein, ostensibly to clarify recent news reports 
alleging connections between Al Qaeda and ARNO forces based 
in Burma.  According to Kyaw Thein, there are links between 
ARNO and Al Qaeda, but all of ARNO\'s bases are in southeast 
Bangladesh. 
 
3. (C) Begin text: 
 
Arakan Rohingya National Organization (ARNO) -- Its 
Historical Background & Latest Situation (Sept, 2002) 
 
Historical Background 
 
Muslim Terrorist-Insurrection groups such as the Rohingya 
Solidarity Organization (RSO), Arakan Rohingya Islamic Front 
(ARIF) and Hak Kavt group combined and established the 
Rohingya National Council (RNC) on 28 October, 1998.  The RNC 
was then reorganized as the Arakan Rohingya National Council 
(ARNC).  The Rohingya Liberation Army (RLA) was also formed 
by combining all the armed insurgents of the groups.  The 
Arakan Rohingya National Organization was formed to organize 
all the different Rohingya insurgents into one group under 
pressure from Muslim groups outside Burma. 
 
Organization of ARNO 
 
The headquarters of ARNO was opened at No. (30 Ju-ma-khar 
street, Ju-ma-khar ward, Chittagong in Bangladesh.  Their 
camps are based at Zai-Lar-Saw-Ri HQ camp--map reference 
(PG-2916), Daw-Maw-Sri camp--map reference (P6-0537) and 
Kyar-Laung-Taik camp--map reference (PG-2026).  ARNO group 
had an estimated strength of about 200 insurgents, of whom 
about 170 are equipped with a variety of arms.  A Central 
Committee of ARNO is organized as follows: 
 
(a)  Chairman 
(b)  Military Commander 
(c)  Secretary 
(d)  Asst Secretary (Chittagong Office-in-Charge) 
(e)  Central Committee Member (Asst Military-in-Charge) 
(f)  do 
(g)  Central Committee Member 
(h)  do 
(i)  do 
(j)  Foreign Liaison-in-Charge 
(k)  Foreign Fund Raiser 
(l)  Representative for Malaysia 
(m)  Cox\'s Bazaar District Organizer 
(n)  Finance Officer 
(o)  Liaison Officer 
(p)  Advisor 
(q)  Camp Commander (Zai-La-Saw-Ri Camp) 
(r)  Deputy Camp Commander 
(s)  Camp Commander (Daw-Maw-Sri Camp) 
(t)  Camp Commander (Kya-Long-Taik Camp) 
 
Meeting of Five Members of ARNO with Taliban leader Osama Bin 
Laden 
 
Five members (names still under inquiry by the GOB) of ARNO 
attended a high-ranking officers\' course with Al Qaeda 
representatives on 15 May, 2000 and arrived back in 
Bangladesh on 22 June.  During the course, they discussed 
matters relating to political and military affairs, arms and 
ammunition, and financing with Osama Bin Laden.  Mohamed Arju 
Taida and Mohamed Rau-Sheik Ar-Mar Darsi from the Taliban 
were present with them at the meeting.  Ninety members of 
ARNO were selected to attend a guerrilla warfare course, a 
variety of explosives courses and heavy-weapons courses held 
in Libya and Afghanistan in August, 2001.  Thirteen out of 
these selected members participated in the explosives and 
heavy-weapons training. 
 
Arrival of Two Taliban at ARNO Headquarters 
 
Al Ha-Saud and Al Ja-hid, two members of Taliban group, 
arrived at ARNO\'s headquarters in Zai-La-Saw-Ri Camp on 2 
November, 2001 from the Rohingya Solidarity Organization\'s 
(RSO) Kann-Grat-Chaung camp.  They met with Nur Islam 
(Chairman), ZaFaur-Ahmed (Secretary) and Fayos Ahmed (acting 
Chief-of-Staff Army), ARNO, and discussed the reorganization 
of RSO and ARNO.  It was learned that ARNO/RSO and Taliban 
groups planned to hold a meeting on 15 November, 2001. Nur 
Islam, Chairman of ARNO, also declared that the Arakan 
Rohingya Islamic Front (ARIF) and the Rohingya Solidarity 
Organization (RSO) had agreed to reorganize as integrated 
members of ARNO. However, Mullah Dil-Mar from RSO did not 
agree with this re-organization and resigned with his 
entourage of insurgents. 
 
Foreign Correspondents Arrived at ARNO Headquarters 
 
Ban-Draban correspondent from Bangladesh, Ha-Saud-Ahmed and 
two foreign correspondents (still under inquiry by GOB) went 
to ARNO\'s headquarters at the Zai-La-Saw-Ri Camp and met with 
the acting Camp Commander who was Chief-of-Staff Army Salein. 
They inquired about the following data. 
 
(a)  Day, Month and Year of establishment of ARNO 
organization. 
(b)  Attitude and objective. 
(c)  The year the ARNO had departed from Myanmar. 
(d)  Present strength of forces and fighters. 
(e)  Types of Arms and Quantity. 
(f)  Is it to build Rakhine as a separate and an independent 
(State/Nation) or to ask for Democracy? 
(g)  List of Anti-Myanmar groups in Bangladesh. 
(h)  Muslim organizations and Non-Muslim organizations in 
Bangladesh to be separately identified. 
(i)  Necessary funding and funding countries. 
(j)  The present financial situation. 
 
Vice Chairman of ARNO Fayos Ahmed\'s Meeting with Insurgent 
Leaders based and active in Thailand 
 
Fayos Ahmed, Vice-Chairman of ARNO, along with U Maung Lu Gyi 
from NUPA (National Unity Party of Arakan), arrived in 
Bangkok from Bangladesh on 27 August, 2002 and proceeded to 
Chiang Mai.  Then, through the Burma Border Consortium, 
including the help of an English woman named Mrs. Pippa 
Curwen, wife of DAB Aye Saung, they talked with the leaders 
of KNPP (Karenni National Progress Party) -- Aung Than Lay 
(Vice Chairman), Raymond Htoo (General Secretary), U Khu-Ral 
(joint General Secretary) and Aung Myat (Chief of Staff - 
Army).  Fayos Ahmed said that ARNO had been told to leave 
Bangladesh by the Bangladesh authorities and that it was 
difficult for them to continue in Bangladesh.  He also 
mentioned that the USA and other various organizations were 
continuously watching them on account of assumed contacts 
with the Al-Qaeda group.  So he asked for a camp to be opened 
in a suitable place in the area of KNPP, in as much as 
Thailand was the most suitable country for them. 
 
Then Fayos Ahmed met with Mai-Aik-Hpone, Secretary of 
Pa-Laung State Liberation Front (PSLF), Khun-Okkar, Chairman 
of Pa-O People Liberation Organization (PPLO) and Aye Maung 
from the Lahu national group.  In addition, he discussed the 
ARNO\'s critical situation with Chiang Mai-based VOA, BBC and 
RFA news media, NGOs in Thailand and Shwe-Kharr of the Chin 
National Front (CNF).  He proceeded from Chiang Mai to Mae 
Sod on 5 September and talked with Bo Mya (Vice-Chairman), 
Pado Man-Sha (General Secretary) and Tar-Ma-La-Baw at KNU 
headquarters. 
 
Fayos Ahmed discussed with KNU the above mentioned matters 
and the possibility of ARNO\'s becoming a member of DAB. 
Application for a membership in DAB by ARNO was not granted 
on the objection of Aung Sein Tha from Democratic Party of 
Arakan (DPA) and Khaing Soe Aung from Arakan Liberation Party 
(ALP).  Both Khaing Soe Aung and Aung Sein Tha bitterly 
rejected the proposal on the grounds that the Rohingya were 
not indigenous to Rakhine State and that they could not 
accept them at all as ethnic people.  Though DAB has not 
granted the membership to ARNO, it has made a military 
alliance with ARNO. 
 
According to Fayos Ahmed, ARNO Military-in-Charge, Salem 
Ulah, had contacts with Al-Qaeda and some members of ARNO 
forces were arrested when they were sent to join the Taliban 
in Afghanistan and attacked the Americans.  These ARNO forces 
were sent to Afghanistan along with Rohingya groups in 
Karachi, Pakistan. Rohingya groups are in many countries like 
Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, UAE, Palestine and 
Australia.  Chairman Nurul Islam has received an American 
visa and departed for Saudi Arabia from Bangladesh, with an 
intent to reside in Saudi Arabia for a short period and then 
depart for the United States.  Fayos Ahmed, during his short 
stay in Thailand, met with Dr. Allen from NCGUB Foreign 
Affairs Department, David Htaw from KNU and David Smile from 
Burma Lawyer Council (BLC).  He went to Thailand as an editor 
of a news media and returned to Bangladesh on 12 September. 
 
Investigation of Members of Rohingya Jihad Caught in Singapore 
 
Hanbali and Baasyia are leaders of Jemaah Islamiyah 
(JI)-organized Rabitatul Mujahideen group which was involved 
in the whole region as a Muslim organization.  Through 
contacts with Muslim groups in the region, active cooperation 
was achieved in matters of training, weapons-buying, 
financing, exchange of information and terrorist military 
operations.  The other organizations which cooperated were 
Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM), two organizations in Southern 
Thailand and Rakhine and Rohingya terrorist-insurgents in 
Myanmar.  ARNO has established a contact with Al-Qaeda and 
five Central Committee members of ARNO paid a visit to 
Afghanistan in April, 2001.  Besides, ARNO has also 
cooperated with Republic of Islam Aceh (RIA) and Egyptian 
Jammah Jihad Mesir (JJM).  It is believed that there exists a 
small community of Rohingya\'s in Patuwat, Malaysia.

Comment 
 
4. (C) The Burmese report has enough specificity to make it 
generally plausible. The Government of Bangladesh advised 
ARNO in May that it had to clear out of its bases in 
southeastern Bangladesh and, shortly thereafter, 195 members 
of the Arakan Army turned themselves in to the Burmese.  As 
yet, ARNO has not moved from Bangladesh.  According to the 
Burmese, ARNO and RSO together still maintain eight bases in 
Bangladesh.  If the Burmese report is correct, however, they 
are looking for a new base of operations. 
 
5. (C) The Burmese view all these groups as terrorists. 
Their purpose in giving us this report is to make sure we are 
aware of the alleged contacts between ARNO and the Burmese 
insurgent groups on the Thai border.  Presumably, they hope 
to bolster relations with the United States by getting credit 
for cooperation on the CT front.  End Summary.

SUBJECT: THAI/BURMESE AGREEMENT TO REOPEN THE BORDER 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Thai Permanent Secretary Tej Bunnag told the 
Burmese October 7 in Rangoon that the Thai cabinet decided to 
prohibit any Thai-based groups from attacking neighboring 
countries, according to Thai embassy sources.  He also 
reportedly said that Prime Minister Thaksin so instructed the 
new Minister of Defense.  The Burmese were evidently 
satisfied.  All border crossings are to reopen on October 15. 
 End Summary. 
 
2. (C) According to Thai embassy sources, the agreed minutes 
of the October 7 meeting between Thai Permanent Secretary Tej 
Bunnag and Burma\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win 
were pre-cooked with an eye to public consumption in 
Thailand.  However, Bunnag also provided oral assurances 
regarding security as part of the negotiations to reopen the 
border.  Basically, Bunnag briefed the Burmese on the Thai 
cabinet decision (reportedly taken on June 28) not to allow 
any groups to use Thai territory for attacks on neighboring 
countries.  Bunnag also told the Burmese that Prime Minister 
Thaksin had directly instructed new Thai Defense Minister 
Thammarak to relay that decision to the First and Third Army 
Commanders, and to ensure that both complied. 
 
3. (C) Other issues incorporated in the agreed minutes 
included narcotics cooperation, border trade, illegal 
workers, and refugees.  On border trade, the Thais agreed 
that all transactions will have to be settled in accordance 
with Burmese trade rules, which now require letters of credit 
rather than telex transfers or cash payments.  On illegal 
workers, the two sides agreed to hold the next joint task 
force meeting in Yangon on November 11.  On the other two 
issues -- refugees and counternarcotics -- the decision was 
simply to renew discussions and cooperation on the same terms 
as before. 
 
4. (C) Thai embassy sources also said that the agreement to 
open the border covered all border crossing points, and not 
just the three major crossings, as reported in the press.  On 
October 15, the three major crossings at Kawthoung, Myawaddy, 
and Tachileik will all be open, as well as all 20 smaller 
crossing points, this source claimed. 
 
5. (C) Finally, Thai embassy sources emphasized that 
relations between Burma and Thailand were still far from 
normal, despite the agreement on opening the border.  The 
newspaper references to Thailand as \"Yodya\" and the ban on 
advertising of Thai products still continued.  Nevertheless, 
the Thai embassy was hopeful that those irritating measures 
would also end as news of the agreement filtered through the 
Burmese bureaucracy. 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C) An improvement in Thai-Burma relations may bolster the 
chances of cooperation on narcotics and other regional 
issues.  It could also serve to reduce the regime\'s concerns 
about perceived Thai support for Burma\'s ethnic insurgents. 
Such a reduction could possibly bolster the confidence of 
some SPDC members on beginning serious dialogue with the NLD 
and ethnics, although other regime supporters would just be 
glad to see troubles on the Thai border diminish.  End

1. (C) Summary: Power is flowing nearly 24 hours a day in the 
capital.  The government is making this happen through a 
hodgepodge of policy proclamations, full dams at the 
hydropower plants, and expensive, and potentially dangerous, 
stopgap measures.  Because of increasing agitation over food 
prices, the regime is trying to hold this Potemkin village 
together until after the harvests in November.  However, as 
we see no long-term solution on the drawing board, we expect 
darkness to descend again by the end of the dry season.  End 
Summary. 
 
Light at the End of the Tunnel? 
 
2. (U) Denizens of Rangoon have been pleasantly surprised by 
nearly 24 hour electricity in their homes since September 18 
or 19.  The government asserts that this will be the reality 
from now on as additional natural gas is brought into the 
city from the offshore Yadana field.  Also, the government 
says, a turbine in a Rangoon-area power plant has been fixed 
allowing for full capacity generation of power.  The 
government mouthpiece newspaper New Light of Myanmar has been 
filled with photos and stories of officials from the Ministry 
of Electric Power visiting power plants, factories, and 
government offices offering \"guidance\" on production and 
conservation of electricity. 
 
3. (C) The government is, in fact, able to pipe some gas now 
from Yadana to the capital.  However, there is less to their 
claims than meets the eye.  This gas is coming over a 
haphazard collection of poorly constructed pipelines of 
varying diameters running from Kanbauk in Tanintharyi 
Division up to Hpa\'an and then on to Rangoon.  A Ministry of 
Energy official claims it is now piping 50 million cubic feet 
a day (mcfd) through this pipeline network (although he 
admitted that most of this was consumed by factories and 
power plants along the way).  UNOCAL says that supplies now 
are running about 40 mcfd, though how long the pipeline can 
sustain the volume remains a question mark.  Because of its 
poor quality, the existing Burmese pipeline system could 
easily be disabled through corrosion, flooding along the 
pipeline\'s path, or explosion. 
 
No Easy Way Out 
 
4. (C) Other than this shaky supply from Yadana, the 
government is relying on four things to keep the lights 
burning in Rangoon. 
 
-- First, the government has ceased piping 8 mcfd of gas per 
day from the onshore A\'Pyauk field, near Rangoon, to a power 
plant near Thaton.  This supply has been redirected to power 
plants in the Rangoon area. 
 
-- Second, the government is now firing up existing 
hydropower plants whose dams are full following the heavy 
monsoon season this year. 
 
-- Third, the government is pushing massive conservation 
efforts, both in the ministries and at state-owned factories. 
 Ministry buildings, government schools, and hospitals are 
kept dark except for emergencies.  A representative of a 
foreign oil company told us that the government has ceased 
sending gas to its fertilizer and methanol plants. 
 
-- Finally, the government is spending precious hard currency 
to import high-speed diesel fuel (at around $40/barrel) to 
run generators and dual-fuel turbines. 
 
5.  (C) These strategies may be effective in the short term, 
but are not sustainable.  As reported in Refs B and C, the 
A\'Pyauk gas field is nearly drained, producing at under 40 
mcfd and declining rapidly.  The other major onshore gas 
field, in Nyaung Doun, is masking some of A\'Pyauk\'s decline 
(producing between 25 and 45 mcfd depending on whom you ask), 
but is being exploited too quickly.  This unwise strategy 
shortens the fields economic life span and risks spoiling the 
gas by sucking water into the reserve.  Based on our sources, 
we think the A\'Pyauk field could run dry within a year.  The 
Nyaung Doun field should hold out a few more years, but 
unsound drilling practices could reduce yield and drive up 
costs of production. 
 
6. (C) Hydropower is also only a temporary balm.  If 
conditions are perfect, hydropower plants in operation can 
generate 350-390 MW of power (Rangoon relies on hydropower 
for 250 MW), but nearly 40 percent of this will be lost 
during transmission.  However, some of these plants are in 
dire need of refurbishment, and in any event, this peak 
generating capacity is available only during the period of 
least demand, during the post-monsoon \"cool season\" (October 
to February).  The dams are usually quite low, and generation 
capacity much reduced, during the \"hot season\" period of peak 
demand (March to July).  The government claims that 2136.6 MW 
of new hydropower will be available over the next five years 
as new dams and plants are built.  However, only about 510 MW 
of new generating capacity is predicted between now and the 
end of 2003 -- and we are skeptical of this number. 
 
7. (C) The Burmese government claims it is moving away from 
fueling its power plants with imported oil as it is a very 
expensive solution -- particularly as the cost of Malaysian 
and Sumatran oil rises alongside Middle East oil.  Domestic 
oil fields are producing about 6000 barrels a day, but the 
production is not economical and provides only about 60 
percent of total domestic demand during normal times.  No new 
oil production is forecasted, although the Chinese National 
Petroleum Company has agreed to work with the Ministry of 
Energy to try and pump out any remaining oil in the old Pyay 
fields north of Rangoon. 
 
8. (C) Finally, radical conservation by government ministries 
will have no real impact on the energy situation here.  More 
alarming is if the government continues to keep hospitals and 
schools in the dark.  Though keeping fertilizer and other 
factories idled will have the largest impact on energy 
conservation (we estimate that heavy industry here consumes 
about 85 mcfd of gas) the impact on the economy, and in the 
case of fertilizer plants food yields, will be devastating. 
 
Which Way Out? 
 
9. (C) Unfortunately there are no quick, or cheap, solutions. 
 The most logical move would be for the Burmese to claim the 
right it negotiated several years ago to 125 million cubic 
feet a day of Yadana gas by approving the Total/UNOCAL plan 
to build a 20-inch pipeline directly from the Yadana to 
Rangoon.  This has been tabled since the end of 2000 due to 
reluctance by Senior General Than Shwe to front the $750 
million (over 15 years) price tag.  A Ministry of Energy 
official said, though, that there was no interest now in 
continuing with this project.  Instead the focus would remain 
on using the existing domestically constructed pipelines, 
cooperating with neighboring countries on regional pipeline 
projects, and on developing hydropower.  The latter two 
priorities are long-term solutions. 
 
10. (C) If, as we predict, Burma\'s dwindling onshore gas 
reserves suddenly become unreliable, the only short-term 
option for the Burmese government will be to try its luck 
buying additional gas from the Yadana pipeline consortium, 
expensive and unlikely if the Thais increase demand or if the 
Burmese do not upgrade their pipeline network.  Another 
option would be to negotiate with the Yetagun operators for a 
share of its Thai-destined gas, though this too would be a 
very expensive solution.  Failing this, the Burmese might 
have to return to the most expensive option of all, shifting 
their plants back onto imported oil, and increasing their 
purchases from Malaysia. 
 
Comment 
 
11. (C) We cannot predict exactly when the lights will start 
going out again, but we would be surprised if the government 
could keep its expensive patchwork of stopgap measures in 
place for long.  Because of growing unrest over mounting food 
prices, see Ref A, the government is desperate to maintain 
the illusion of government sacrifice and electricity upgrades 
until after the rice harvest in October of November. 
However, once the flush of monsoon-driven hydropower subsides 
in January and February, the government will be stuck trying 
to supply nearly all the country\'s energy needs with imported 
oil and gas.  This is an impossible proposition for an 
already foreign exchange-poor country.  End comment.

SUBJECT: LATEST GOB REPORT ON SHAN RAPES FINDS FIVE OUT OF 
173 CASES VERIFIABLE 
 
REF: (A) RANGOON 1070 (B) RANGOON 1304 
 
1.  (U) Summary:  On October 16, the GOB presented results of 
its latest investigation of the allegations contained in the 
Shan Human Rights Foundation\'s \"Licence to Rape.\"  The GOB 
claims that it has now re-investigated all 173 cases and 
found that only five cases bear even any \"similarity\" to the 
incidents in the SHRF report.  The GOB has invited UN SR 
Pinheiro to visit Shan State but was not specific as to what 
investigative activities, if any, he will engage in.  We 
should insist that SR Pinheiro take an active role in looking 
into the SHRF allegations when he visits Shan State as there 
must be a better accounting of what actually happened.  The 
GOB\'s latest approach to the SHRF report shows that they may 
be developing an understanding that they cannot just deny 
allegations of human rights abuses, but the GOB\'s numbers 
just do not add up.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) On October 16, the GOB, in the person of the Deputy 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, briefed all of the chiefs of 
diplomatic missions and heads of UN agencies on the results 
of the GOB\'s latest investigation of the allegations 
contained in the May 2002 Shan Human Rights Foundation\'s 
\"License to Rape.\"  This second GOB investigation was only 
motivated by the realization that the whitewash that the GOB 
tried to pass off in their report of their original 
investigation in August 2002 (see Ref  A) earned them nothing 
but skepticism and derision from the international human 
rights community and the press.  The DepFonMin stressed 
repeatedly that this investigation was \"on site, on the 
ground, and personal.\" 
 
3.   (U) Post previously detailed some of the findings of 
this latest GOB report that had been passed to us while it 
was in draft stage.  Two of the reported incidents vary 
considerably from what we had been told in confidence by a 
seniior military officer in early October (see Ref  B).  A 
summary of the latest GOB findings is as follows (post is 
faxing the GOB summary of the five cases to EAP/BCLTV and the 
GOB is translating the complete report of the investigations 
of the 173 cases into English for distribution).  Case 
numbers refer to corresponding cases in the SHRF report: 
 
- Case 3:  Some confusion on actual name of the perpetrator, 
but it was an attempted, and unsuccessful, sexual assault. 
The attacker apologized to the victim publicly and paid a 
monetary compensation to her.  The victim did not press any 
further charges. 
 
-- Case  53:  Villagers reported the rape to the local 
platoon commander who then ordered the attacker to be brought 
in for questioning.  The soldier resisted, opened fire on his 
senior office, and was killed in the ensuing gunfight. 
 
-- Case 55:  A clandestine love affair that became very 
public.  The couple was caught \"in the act\" and publicly 
embarrassed.  According to the GOB investigation, the victim 
said she had not been sexually molested against her will, the 
soldier paid compensation to her, her parents, and some 
neighbors.  The soldier was also transferred out of the area. 
 
-- Case 60:  A disabled schoolgirl was raped twice in one 
day, once by a Burmese soldier and once by a soldier of the 
Shan State National Army (SSNA).  The Burmese soldier was 
tried and sentenced to 10 years hard labor.  The SSNA soldier 
was executed by the SSNA. 
 
-- Case 69:  The details of the dates of the incident were 
different than the SHRF report.  However, the crime did occur 
and one of the attackers was sentenced to life imprisonment 
and two other soldiers were each sentenced to three years at 
hard labor.  The senior officer in charge of the soldiers 
forfeited a year of service. 
 
4.  (U) The GOB now claims to have investigated all 173 cases 
of sexual violence against women recounted in the SHRF report 
and states that these are the only cases that bore even any 
\"similarity\" to the incidents in the SHRF report.  The 
DepFonMin also stated that the GOB has invited UN Special 
Rapporteur Pinheiro to visit Shan State but declined to be 
specific as to what investigative activities, if any, he will 
engage in. 
 
5.  (U) The DepFonMin also stated that any future possibility 
of an independent investigation by an international 
organization would be \"another matter\".  He stated 
\"categorically\" that the GOB considers such an investigation 
to be an infringement on its national sovereignty. 
 
6.  (U) Comment:  Although the number of cases that the GOB 
is even admitting had some foundation in fact is still 
appallingly small, this latest approach to the whole question 
of the SHRF report indicates they may perhaps be developing a 
glimmer of understanding that they cannot just deny 
allegations of human rights abuses and play the role of 
conspiracy victim.  Their handling of this latest briefing on 
the SHRF report was much more professional, coherent, and 
detailed than the previous one, which was a fiasco (see Ref 
A).   However, SR Pinheiro should take a very active role in 
looking into the SHRF allegations when he visits Shan State. 
Ideally, the UNHCR could send a team to delve into the 
allegations.  There must be a better accounting of what 
actually happened - the GOB\'s numbers just do not add up and 
claims of national sovereignty do not as wash as a basis to 
refuse to allow independent investigation of the violence 
depicted in the SHRF report.

WITH PINHEIRO DURING THIS VISIT AND STRESS THAT HE MUST NOT 
STEP BACK FORM CONFRONTING THE GOB AND EXERTING EVERY 
PRESSURE TO MAKE THEM AGREE TO THE OHCHR INVESTIGATIVE TEAM. 
HOWEVER, THE USG AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS WILL NEED TO COMMIT TO 
FUNDING AN OHCHR \"FACT FINDING\" MISSION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) SR PINHEIRO BRIEFED EU, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, AND U.S. 
REPRESENTATIVES ON HIS PLANS OR HIS VISIT TO BURMA AND IN 
PARTICULAR HIS PLAN OF ACTION REGARDING INVESTIGATION OF THE 
SHAN RAPE ALLEGATIONS.  HE OUTLINED THREE OPTIONS: 
 
-- PLAN A - A JOINT INVESTIGATION BY SPDC, NLD AND ETHNIC 
REPRESENTATIVES (ALL AGREED THIS IS A NON-STARTER) 
-- PLAN B - AN INVESTIGATION (THE TERM FACT-FINDING IS 
PREFERRED AS \"INVESTIGATION\" REALLY RAISES THE GOB\'S HACKLES) 
BY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORS OPERATING UNDER PINHEIRO\'S UNSR 
HUMAN RIGHTS MANDATE (TO INCLUDE PARTICIPATION BY THE UNSR

SOLE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING THE SHAN RAPE ALLEGATIONS (THIS 
WOULD TAKE PLACE IF AT ALL, IN THE FAR DISTANT FUTURE AS 
OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD NOT BE NOT HIGH ON THE CURRENT UN AGENDA) 
 
3.  (SBU) AFTER SOLICITING COMMENTS FROM THE VARIOUS MEMBERS 
AROUND THE TABLE, PLAN B (JUST AS IN REFTEL) PINHEIRO AGREED 
THAT PLAN B IS THE ONLY OPTION THAT WOULD SATISFY THE GOB\'S 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ONLY OPTION 
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITY WOULD FIND 
CREDIBLE.  PINHEIRO STATED THAT HE WOULD PUT THIS PROPOSAL tO 
THE GOB IN COURTEOUS BUT VERY STRONG TERMS AND WOULD ADVISE 
THEM THAT IF THEY DID NOT AGREE, THEN HIS UPCOMING REPORT TO 
THE UN WOULD BE VERY HARSH. 
 
4. (SBU) PINHEIRO SAID THAT THE GOB WOULD HAVE TO AGREE AND 
GUARANTEE THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT PLAN 
B: 
 
--  FREE ACCESS TO ALL VICTIMS AND WITNESSES 
--  FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT TO ALL LOCALES INCLUDING AND 
ESPECIALLY BORDER AREAS 
--  FREEDOM TO DECIDE THE COMPOSITION OF THE TEAM 
--  FREEDOM TO DECIDE THE LENGTH OF TIME THE TEAM WOULD NEED 
FOR THE INVESTIGATION 
--  FREEDOM TO VERIFY THAT COOPERATING WITNESSES/VICTIMS DID 
NOT SUFFER REPRISALS 
 
5. (SBU) PER REFTEL, PINHEIRO STRESSED THAT FUNDING COULD BE 
A STUMBLING BLOCK AND ASKED FOR REASSURANCES THAT FUNDS WOULD 
BE FORTHCOMING, ASSURANCES THAT HE RECEIVED VERY CLEARLY FROM 
THE U.S., AUSTRALIAN, AND U.K COM\'S PRESENT, AND WITH SOME 
INDICATION FROM OTHERS AROUND THE TABLE THAT THEY WOULD ALSO 
BE WILLING TO FUND. 
 
6.  (SBU) SR PINHEIRO SAID THAT THE GOB HAD PLANNED A VERY 
FULL PROGRAM FOR HIM IN SHAN STATE BUT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF 
GOING THERE.  HE SAID HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DISCOVER 
ANYTHING DURING HIS CURRENT VISIT CONDITIONS AND THE GOB 
WOULD USE A VISIT TO SHAN STATE AS A \"BENEDICTION\" OF THEIR 
ACTIONS.  HE ALSO COMPLAINED THAT HE WAS VERY IRRITATED THAT 
SPDC SPOKESMAN HLA MIN HAD BEEN TOUTING HIS VISIT AS BEING A 
RESPONSE TO A GOB INVITATION TO INVESTIGATE THE RAPE 
ALLEGATIONS.  PINHEIRO SAID THIS WAS PART OF HIS NORMAL 
SCHEDULE OF SR VISITS AND NOT PREDICATED ON INVESTIGATING THE 
RAPE ALLEGATIONS. 
7.  (SBU) PINHEIRO WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO 
FOLLOW THE GOB\'S VERY DETAILED PLAN FOR HIS VISIT BUT WOULD 
PURSUE HIS OWN AGENDA IN ADDITION TO AN OUTBRIEF FOR THE SAME 
GROUP HE MET WITH TODAY, HE ASKED TO MEET WITH COM PRIVATELY 
THIS WEEKEND TO PROVIDE A READOUT AFTER HIS FIRST FEW DAYS 
HERE AND TO DISCUSS OUR FINDINGS IN RELATION TO THE RECENT 
VISIT OF DRL/IRF\'S PAUL MARTIN.               . 
 
8.  (SBU) COMMENT:  SR PINHEIRO\'S MESSAGE WAS CONSISTENT WITH 
THE POSITIONS HE EXPRESSED IN HIS RECENT MEETINGS WITH EAP 
DAS MATT DALEY AND DRL A/S LORNE CRANER.  WE WILL STAY IN 
CLOSE CONTACT WITH PINHEIRO DURING THIS VISIT AND STRESS THAT 
HE MUST NOT STEP BACK FROM CONFRONTING THE GOB AND EXERTING

REF: A. (A) STATE 190339 
     B. (B) STATE 157297 
     C. (C) 01 RANGOON 1747 
 
1. (U) Summary: Burma has responded well to the criteria 
outlined in our certification demarche.  It has continued to 
enforce its counternarcotics laws, increased pressure on 
cease-fire groups such as the United Wa State Army, and 
sharply reduced the production of opium and heroin within its 
territories.  It has also improved its counternarcotics 
cooperation with China and other states, contributing to the 
arrest of several major drug traffickers wanted abroad. 
Seizures of opium, heroin, and other narcotics have also 
increased in 2002, though ATS seizures have lagged.  In 
addition, Burma enacted new money laundering legislation in 
2002 and should open up its first cases under the new law 
before the close of the year.  It also continued to prosecute 
corrupt police and military officers.  Between 1995 and May 
2002, a total of 248 police and military officers were 
disciplined for narcotics-related corruption and drug abuse. 
Finally, in cooperation with UNDCP and several international 
NGOs, Burma has maintained a simple, but apparently effective 
demand reduction program that has held drug abuse in Burma to 
one of the lowest levels in the region.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The paragraphs below are keyed to the criteria 
outlined in our certification demarche. 
 
3. (U) Drug Dealers: Comply with the provisions of UN Drug 
Conventions by taking demonstrable and verifiable actions 
against high level drug traffickers and their organizations, 
such as arresting and convicting leading UWSA drug producers 
and traffickers 
 
The GOB has continued to enforce its counternarcotics laws. 
While its reach was limited in the past by the special 
dispensation it had given several major cease-fire groups on 
the Chinese border, nevertheless, over the past fourteen 
years, it has made almost 90,000 arrests on drug-related 
charges.  Of those arrested, 42 were eventually sentenced to 
death, 37 were given life imprisonment, and an additional 
12,500 were given prison terms of more than 10 years.  During 
the first eight months of 2002, Burma has arrested another 
4,148 suspects.  It has also continued with prosecutions.  In 
the five months up to May 2002, 850 drug dealers were given 
prison terms in excess of ten years. 
 
Several of these arrests and convictions were directly the 
result of cooperation with the United States, Australia, 
China, Thailand, and other states.  These included: 
 
-- Cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the Australian Federal Police in the 
seizure of 357 kilograms of heroin in Fiji in October 2000. 
Death sentences were eventually handed down in Yangon for two 
drug kingpins connected with this case. 
 
-- Cooperation with Thailand in the seizure of 116 kilograms 
of heroin and 7.8 million methamphetamine tablets in February 
2002.  Two of the principals behind this shipment were also 
eventually convicted in Yangon and sentenced to \"indefinite\" 
(i.e., unending) terms in prison. 
 
-- Cooperation with China in a series of arrests and seizures 
that have continued throughout 2001 and 2002 all along the 
Chinese border following the signature of a Chinese/Burmese 
MOU on counternarcotics operations in January 2001.  Since 
then, Burma has turned over 22 separate fugitives to China, 
including members of one group (Tan Xiao Lin and company) 
which China described as the \"largest armed drug-trafficking 
gang in the Golden Triangle.\" 
 
-- Cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the Chinese police on a seizure of 12.5 
kilograms of heroin in Hong Kong on July 11, 2002. Evidence 
collected in that case will provide the basis for one of the 
first prosecutions in Burma under the GOB\'s new money 
laundering law. 
 
-- Cooperation with Thailand and the United States in the 
arrest of Yang Chia-ho, a United Wa State Army officer and a 
confederate of the notorious Wa chieftain, Wei Hsueh Kang. 
Yang Chia-ho was taken into custody together with more than 5 
million methamphetamine tablets and 41 kilos of heroin in 
Tachileik, Burma on October 4, 2002. 
 
Burma has also ratcheted up the pressure on cease-fire groups 
like the Wa and the Kokang Chinese, who were originally left 
relatively free to develop the narcotics trade in their 
self-administered areas along the Chinese border.  Starting 
in September 2001, the GOB has mounted a series of joint 
operations in cooperation with the Chinese which resulted in 
a series of major arrests in Laukkai, the capital of Kokang 
Chinese Special Region No. 1.  In March, 2002, it also 
demanded that new counternarcotics decrees be issued by the 
Wa, the Kokang Chinese, and other cease-fire groups.  Those 
decrees outlawed participation in any aspect of the narcotics 
trade.  The GOB also demanded and received cooperation from 
the United Wa State Army in bringing to heel several 
fugitives wanted by China in April and May 2002.  In 
addition, it has begun a campaign to close down the liaison 
offices of armed groups like the United Wa State Army, and of 
companies associated with those groups in Tachileik, 
Myawaddy, and other towns on the Thai/Burmese border. 
Finally, the GOB has continued to hold all of the cease-fire 
groups to their pledges to end opium production in their 
territories.  U Sai Lin\'s Special Region No. 4 around Mong La 
has been opium-free since 1997 and the Wa are, thus far, on 
track to eliminate opium by 2005.  The Kokang Chinese missed 
their opium-free target (scheduled for the year 2000), but 
have paid a heavy price for that failure in terms of 
increased attention from both the Burmese and the Chinese 
police. 
 
4. (U) Narcotics Elimination: Increase opium eradication and 
provide location data for verification purposes; 
significantly increase seizure rates for opium, heroin, and 
methamphetamines; control the diversion of precursor 
chemicals; and destroy significantly more heroin and 
methamphetamine laboratories. 
 
Opium production in Burma declined for the sixth straight 
year in 2002.  According to the U.S./Burma Joint Opium Yield 
Survey, the maximum potential yield for opium in Burma in 
2002 totaled only 630 metric tons, down 235 metric tons (or 
27 percent) from 2001.  Over the past six years (i.e., since 
1996), opium production in Burma has declined by more than 75 
percent, dropping from an estimated 2,560 metric tons in 1996 
to 2002\'s total of only 630 metric tons.  Approximately half 
of this decline reflects a decline in acreage under 
cultivation (which dropped by more than half to only 78,000 
hectares in 2002).  The remainder was due to lower yields 
(now only about 8 kilograms/hectare) throughout Burma. 
 
The results in regard to methamphetamine production are 
harder to measure.  While figures for the production of 
methamphetamine production in Burma are batted about (e.g., 
400 million, 600 million, or 800 million pills), the basis 
for these estimates is unclear.  As a result, it is difficult 
to judge on the basis of current information to what degree 
Burma is or is not making progress in controlling 
methamphetamine production. 
 
It is clear, however, that narcotics seizures in Burma have 
increased during 2002, at least in regard to opium and 
heroin, most of which is trafficked through China. During the 
first eight months of 2002, the GOB seized 1,563 kilograms of 
opium and 213 kilograms of heroin.  This compares with 
seizures of 1,629 kilograms of opium and 96 kilograms of 
heroin during all of 2001.  In contrast, seizures of 
methamphetamine tablets were lower during the first eight 
months of 2002, totaling only 3,605,615 pills.  This may 
reflect a complete disruption of the ATS trade out of Burma 
as a result of the tensions with Thailand, poor Burmese 
enforcement efforts or simply new methods and routes of 
trafficking that the Burmese have yet to uncover.  Whatever 
the reason, recent large seizures by Burmese forces in 
Tachileik (see above) have begun to make up the deficit. 
 
GOB eradication efforts have also continued.  Altogether, the 
GOB appears to have eradicated slightly less than 7,400 
hectares of opium poppy during the 2001/02 crop year, a total 
approximately equal to 10 percent of the acreage under opium 
cultivation.  It also provided the United States with 
information on the states, townships, and villages within 
which these eradication campaigns were conducted and has 
agreed to provide GPS coordinates for verification purposes 
during the coming crop year. 
 
5. (U) International Cooperation: Continue cooperation with 
China and Thailand and Expand Cooperation to other 
neighboring countries such as India. 
 
Burma has been able to recruit strong allies in its efforts 
to eliminate drugs.  Since 2001, Burma has signed MOUs with 
China (in January) and Thailand (in June).  The MOU with 
China laid down the ground rules for joint operations, which 
in turn led to a series of arrests of major traffickers 
during the spring and summer of 2001 (see above). 
 
Burma\'s MOU with Thailand committed both countries to closer 
police cooperation on the border.  This was firmed up during 
an August 2001 meeting of police chiefs from both sides of 
the border who agreed to share information and establish 
joint \"narcotics suppression coordination stations\" in the 
Chiang Rai/Tachileik, Mae Sot/Myawaddy, and Ranong/Kawthoung 
border areas.  During Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt\'s September 2001 
visit to Thailand, Thailand also offered a 20 million baht 
(about $440,000) alternative development project in Burma. In 
May 2002, tensions on the Thai/Burmese border disrupted this 
nascent cooperation, but, with the resolution of those 
problems, both governments have committed themselves to 
renewed cooperation. 
 
Burma also participated actively in multilateral meetings on 
narcotics control.  These included a regional ministerial 
meeting (organized in cooperation with UNDCP) on drug control 
in Rangoon in May, 2001, and a quadrilateral ministerial 
meeting involving Burma, Laos, China, and Thailand in August 
2001.  In November 2001, Burma agreed to contribute to the 
ACCORD plan of action, which serves as an umbrella for a 
variety of global programs aimed at strengthening the rule of 
law, promoting alternative development, and increasing civic 
awareness of the dangers of drugs.  It has also supported the 
1993 Memorandum of Understanding that was signed among the 
six regional states -- Burma, China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, 
and Cambodia -- to control narcotics production and has 
participated in all meetings of that group.  Put simply, 
Burma is part of every major multilateral narcotics control 
program in the region. 
 
Finally, Burma has signed drug control cooperation agreements 
with virtually all states in the region.  These include 
agreements with Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, the Philippines, 
India, and the Russian Federation, in addition to China and 
Thailand. 
 
6. (U) Money Laundering: Enforce existing money laundering 
laws, including asset forfeiture provisions, and fully 
implement and enforce Burma\'s new money laundering 
legislation. 
 
The GOB enacted new and relatively powerful money laundering 
legislation in June 2002.  That legislation criminalizes 
money laundering in connection with virtually every kind of 
serious criminal activity and levies heavy responsibilities 
on banks in regard to reporting.  Penalties are also 
substantial.  The police, in cooperation with the Central 
Bank and the Attorney General\'s office, have developed rules 
and regulations to implement the law, which should be 
published shortly.  The government has also held training 
seminars on money laundering and financial investigations in 
Mandalay and other cities.  Investigations have started, and 
it is expected that the first prosecutions under the new law 
will take place before the close of 2002.  The GOB\'s goal now 
is to establish a record of enforcement over the coming year 
that will justify Burma\'s removal from the Financial Action 
Task Force\'s list of non-complying countries. 
 
The GOB is also drafting new Mutual Legal Assistance 
legislation which should be enacted in 2003.  Once enacted, 
that legislation will facilitate the negotiation of Mutual 
Legal Assistance Treaties and greater legal and judicial 
cooperation in pursuing money laundering and other cases. 
 
7. (U) Corruption: Prosecute drug-related corruption, 
especially corrupt government and military officials who 
facilitate drug trafficking and money laundering. 
 
In 2001, the GOB indicated that 32 Burmese police officers 
have been punished for narcotics related corruption since the 
beginning of 2000.  Punishments took the form of 
imprisonments, terminations, demotions, and forced 
retirements.  Jail sentences have been imposed on 17 
officers, including 1 police major and 2 police lieutenants. 
Four officers have been terminated, including 2 police 
lieutenants, and six officers were forced to retire, 
including 4 police lieutenants.  Over the same period of 
time, they said, 7 Burmese army soldiers, including 1 major 
and three other officers, were charged with narcotics-related 
corruption. 
 
In 2002, the GOB expanded this list of prosecutions to 
include over 200 police officials and 48 Burmese Army 
personnel who were punished for narcotics-related corruption 
or drug abuse between 1995 and May 2002.  Of the 200 police 
officers, 130 were imprisoned, 16 were dismissed from the 
service, 7 were forced to retire, and 47 were demoted. 
 
8. (U) Demand Reduction: Expand demand reduction, prevention 
and drug treatment programs to reduce drug use and control 
the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
 
If the level of drug use is the measure of success in demand 
reduction, then Burmese programs have been a success.  The 
overall level of drug abuse is low in Burma compared with 
neighboring countries.  According to the GOB, there are only 
about 70,000 \"officially registered\" drug abusers in Burma. 
While this is undoubtedly an underestimate, even UNDCP 
estimates that there may be no more than 300,000 people 
(still less than 1 percent of the population) who abuse drugs 
in Burma.  Most, particularly among the older generation, use 
opium, but use of heroin and synthetic drugs is rising, 
particularly in urban and mining areas. 
 
Burmese demand reduction programs are in part coercive and in 
part voluntary.  Addicts are required to register and can be 
prosecuted if they fail to register and accept treatment. 
Altogether, more 21,000 addicts were prosecuted for failing 
to register between 1994 and April 2002. 
 
Demand reduction programs and facilities are strictly 
limited, however.  There are six major drug treatment centers 
under the Ministry of Health, 49 other smaller detox centers, 
and 8 rehabilitation centers which, together, have reportedly 
provided treatment to about 55,000 addicts over the past 9 
years.  There are also a variety of narcotics awareness 
programs conducted through the public school system. 
According to UNDCP, approximately 1,200 high school teachers 
participated in seminars, training programs, and workshops 
connected with these programs in 2001.  In addition, the 
government has established demand reduction programs in 
cooperation with INGOs.  These include programs with CARE 
Myanmar, World Concern, and Population Services 
International, all of which focus on injecting drug use as a 
factor in the spread of HIV/AIDS.

1. (C) Summary:  Japanese experts say that Japan plans to 
discuss economic reform during Prime Minister Koizumi\'s 
meeting with Senior General Than Shwe at the November ASEAN 
3 meeting in Phnom Penh.  They have also promised to share 
with us a copy of their proposed program for Burmese 
structural adjustment.  End summary. 
 
Economic Aid Plan? Not Yet. 
 
2. (C)  Professor Masahiko Ebashi, one of the leaders of a 
Japanese government-sponsored team here to work with the 
Burmese government on structural reform, told the Chief of 
Mission that the Japanese government is eager to get economic 
reform started in Burma, and is willing to pay for it.  The 
team of Japanese experts will complete its work here soon, 
expecting to finalize a report by December for publication 
next March. 
 
3. (C) Professor Ebashi was discouraged by the complete 
disinterest of the Ministers with whom his team was supposed 
to be working.  Only Brigadier General David Abel, the 
regime\'s sole competent economic mind, has worked closely 
with the group.  However, Ebashi was encouraged that 
technocrats in the Central Bank and other agencies had shown 
a \"genuine\" interest in reform.  He said his group had 
concluded that it was essential to build capacity now within 
the GOB through engagement and promotion of economic reform. 
It will be too late if the international community waits 
until the political situation changes.  Further sanctions 
and/or continued economic isolation, he fears, will destroy 
whatever influence these nascent reformers have. 
 
4. (C) The leadership of Burma has made it clear, however, 
that they will not implement any reforms unless there is 
accompanying finance.  Ebashi said that he believed the IMF 
had made a mistake by issuing reform instructions with no aid 
to back it up (see Ref D).  To avoid similar problems, his 
team was designing a program of incremental economic 
structural adjustment aid, each tranche of which would be 
tied to specific economic reforms.  This model had worked 
before in Vietnam, he said.  However, Burma could not be 
subjected to the same strict conditionality as Vietnam, 
Ebashi argued.  Ebashi said that he hopes a reform package 
for Burma could be developed in time for the bilateral 
meeting scheduled between Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi and 
Burma\'s Senior General Than Shwe at the November ASEAN   3 
Summit in Phnom Penh. 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C) Ebashi may be the only one thinking along these lines, 
however.  Japanese Embassy officials here tell us that while 
a bilateral meeting at the ASEAN   3 is in the works, nothing 
is finalized yet.  If this meeting is arranged, one official 
said, economic reform will certainly be a topic for 
discussion, but there will not be talk of structural 
assistance.  The Japanese government, he said, recognizes 
that any talk of financial assistance for structural reform 
would be premature, pending further motion on political 
transition in Burma.  He also said that the GOJ would share 
with us a copy of its report on structural adjustment here 
when it is ready, and would consult with the United States, 
the IMF, and the World Bank before taking any significant 
steps in Burma.  End comment.

1. (C)  Summary: At an October 28 briefing, UN Special 
Rapporteur Pinheiro told diplomats in Rangoon that during his 
12-day visit to Burma he strongly encouraged the SPDC to 
address continuing human rights abuses.  He also encouraged 
the international community to implement programs that will 
promote human rights in Burma (citing Australia\'s human 
rights training program as an example), or conditions will 
get much worse.  Democratic reform, in his view, is not in 
the offing and human rights problems in Burma are too 
pressing to wait for this change.  Pinheiro said Secretary 
One Khin Nyunt was \"not negative\" in response to his call for 
action on abuses and was proud of the SPDC\'s successes.  Khin 
Nyunt cited actions to combat narcotics, trafficking in 
persons, and HIV/AIDS as evidence of progress.  Pinheiro said 
the SPDC has been responsive to ICRC recommendations for 
improvements in prisons and conditions for political 
prisoners, in particular, have improved as a result. 
Pinheiro proposed to the SPDC the expansion of ICRC 
monitoring to areas of continuing conflict.  He also 
encouraged the SPDC to endorse one of three options for an 
international assessment of the alleged systematic rapes by 
the military in Shan State.  While Pinheiro\'s briefing was 
characteristically upbeat - designed to keep the door open 
with the regime - he privately expressed his frustration to 
COM Martinez, noting that he does not know how much longer he 
will continue as SR if the regime does not address continuing 
serious abuses.  End Summary. 
 
General Assessment 
 
2. (C)  On October 28, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights 
in Burma Paulo Sergio Pinheiro (SR) briefed the diplomatic 
corps here at the completion of his 12-day visit, the fourth 
visit since he was appointed.  The SR said that the SPDC had 
cooperated fully in his requests for meetings and assisted 
him in all logistical aspects of the visit.  He had met with 
Secretary One Khin Nyunt, the Foreign Minister, Deputy 
 
SIPDIS 
Foreign Minister, the Ministry of Home Affairs and other SPDC 
officials in Rangoon and at the regional level when he 
traveled to Mon State.  The SR said he carried the same 
message to all these officials at each meeting: the SPDC 
needs to do more now to address the serious human rights 
abuses in the country.  He characterized the officials\' 
responses to this appeal as \"not negative.\"  He said that 
while they did not make any specific commitments in response, 
they did not harshly rebut his statement that problems exist; 
he took this as a positive indication.  Secretary One 
described to the SR how the SPDC had taken many positive 
steps, citing in particular, progress in combating narcotics, 
trafficking in persons, and HIV/AIDS.  The SR was surprised 
by Secretary One\'s openness compared with previous meetings 
in discussing political prisoners.  Rather than denying the 
existence of political prisoners as he had done in the past, 
Secretary One said the GOB has released over 400 political 
 
SIPDIS 
prisoners in \"direct response\" to the SR\'s requests, and 
readily discussed with the SR remaining categories and 
subcategories of political prisoners. 
 
3. (C)  SR Pinheiro appealed to the international community 
to \"cooperate now\" with the SPDC on ways to improve human 
rights in the country.  He said there is no reason to hope 
for democratic change anytime soon - \"democracy (at least the 
Western version) is far away in the minds of these gentlemen\" 
- and conditions demand action now on programs that will 
improve human rights.  Pinheiro emphasized that \"if there is 
not greater cooperation now things will get much worse.\"  He 
cited the Australian human rights workshops for SPDC 
officials as an example of an activity that has been 
criticized but which he endorses because it sensitizes 
trainees to international human rights standards.  He 
strongly encouraged the international community to \"engage\" 
by identifying community activities in cooperation with the 
NLD that will secure better human rights. 
 
ICRC Gets High Marks 
 
4. (C)  SR Pinheiro said his visits to prisons indicate that 
the International Committee for the Red Cross is continuing 
to make good progress in improving prison conditions.  He 
said the ICRC has made over 200 visits to 80 facilities in 
the last two years, and prisoners confirm to him that, as a 
result, conditions have greatly improved.  Pinheiro said that 
he has heard no reports of abuses of political prisoners in 
the last two years.  He noted that while prison conditions 
for the general prison population are now generally worse 
than that of political prisoners, the conditions are not that 
bad compared to some others in the world (e.g. he cited the 
deplorable conditions in some lock-ups in Sao Paulo.) 
 
5. (C)  Hoping to build on the ICRC\'s successes in prisons, 
Pinheiro proposed to the SPDC (after previously clearing with 
ICRC) that ICRC be allowed to establish a presence in all 
areas of armed conflict to report on abuses in 
confidentiality to the SPDC.  He did not yet have a response 
 
SIPDIS 
to the proposal. 
 
Follow-up on Shan Rape Allegations 
 
6. (C)  Pinheiro said the SPDC had thoroughly briefed him 
their latest investigation into the Army\'s alleged use of 
systematic rape in Shan State.  He said that while the 
investigation appeared to be professional and the SPDC had 
apparently put a lot of energy into it, he told them that no 
one would believe it because it was done by the military. 
Warning SPDC officials that if they persisted in just denying 
the allegations they would face serious consequences from the 
international community, he offered three options for an 
independent assessment (as reported in reftel).  The options 
were: 
 
-- a national Ombudsman or Commission (composed of opposition 
and government members) created with the assistance of the 
UNHRC (which ASSK agreed to participate in although she was 
skeptical if it could work, he said); 
 
-- a team of experts led by the SR to investigate the 
charges; and 
 
-- a Commission of Inquiry with a mandate from the UN 
Secretary General or UNHRC. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
7. (C)  Pinheiro said he believes the second option would be 
the most effective and he had told the SPDC this.  He noted 
that a prerequisite for any of the options would be 
sufficient funding from the international community (Note: 
COM Martinez told the group the U.S. would support the idea 
but pressed others, not just the EU but ASEAN and other 
neighboring countries, to also provide resources so that it 
did not appear to be a U.S. controlled activity.  End Note.) 
Pinheiro also said that any inquiry should not be limited to 
just the Shan State rape allegations but should address 
abuses in general in areas of conflict; \"black areas.\"  He 
emphasized that abuses by armed insurgent groups must also be 
addressed in the inquiry, as this is a problem that is rarely 
mentioned. 
 
8. (C)  Pinheiro said he will not mention these options in 
the press briefing on his trip (wanting to give the SPDC 
flexibility in its response) but he told the SPDC that if 
they do not express a preference to him by the time of his 
report on November 6, he is prepared to initiate option two 
(in which he would personally participate).  He said the 
regime appears seriously concerned about international 
criticism regarding the allegations and he thinks the SPDC 
will allow some independent assessment, although they have 
previously stated this was out of the question. 
 
Comment 
 
9. (C)  While Pinheiro\'s briefing to the diplomatic corps was 
characteristically upbeat (he wants to keep the door open 
with the regime in order to continue to push for reforms), he 
has privately expressed his frustration to COM Martinez 
regarding the regime\'s lack of action to curb continuing 
abuses.  He told the COM early in the visit that he came to 
Burma with a view to keeping communications open with the 
regime and giving them the benefit of the doubt whenever 
possible.  He said his patience is running out as he sees 
very little progress on curbing serious human rights abuses, 
especially in areas of conflict.  He said he does not 
believe, on balance, that abuses of religious freedom or 
prisoners for instance make Burma the \"world champions\" 
compared to abuses in other countries, but he does find the 
pervasive SPDC control over every citizen\'s life oppressive 
and the abuses against citizens deemed enemies of the state 
unacceptable.  It is these abuses, unfortunately, that the 
SPDC seems least willing to address.  Pinheiro told the COM 
that he may not continue as SR if he does not see some change 
by the SPDC in the near future.  He quipped that they would 
be sorry to lose him, someone who has been willing to try to 
work with them, if he is replaced by an SR from a country 
with a less flexible Burma policy than Brazil, i.e., the 
Scandinavians or EU.

1. (SBU)  On October 23 the Committee Representing the 
Peoples, Parliament (CRPP) announced that it was appointing 
four new ethnic members and inviting other political parties 
to join.  The CRPP was created by the NLD and ethnic parties 
in September 1998 to represent the Parliament that was 
elected in 1990 but never allowed to take power.  The parties 
represented by the CRPP won approximately ninety percent of 
the seats in the 1990 elections.  When the Committee was 
created in 1998 the regime responded harshly, arresting more 
than 200 activists and Members of Parliament-elect. 
 
2. (C)  Expanding the CRPP at this time is an important step 
in publicly consolidating ethnic support behind the NLD and 
improving communications and coordination between ethnic 
groups (which the junta attempts to keep isolated and 
factionalized).  It also creates a good mechanism for 
incorporating ethnic concerns into any NLD dialogue with the 
SPDC on national reconciliation, should that occur.  The big 
question is whether these actions by the CRPP will also serve 
to prod the SPDC toward a dialogue or just lead to another 
crackdown.  The ethnic political leaders tell us they believe 
this was \"the right card to play\" as MP-elects with a 
responsibility to show the people that they are concerned for 
their well-being.  SNLD Chairman Hkun Htoon Oo also said, 
however, that Military Intelligence had already contacted him 
warning that he and the other ethnic groups are being 
\"confrontational\" by officially joining the CRPP, which the 
military has always viewed as a slap at its rule. 
 
3.  (C)  The CRPP could figure in a future political 
transitional phase, but the potential clout of this largely 
moribund committee is difficult to judge.

1. (U) Summary: The GOB has provided a response to our 
request for additional information on Burma\'s performance in 
regard to the criteria set by the U.S. government for 
certification of its counternarcotics efforts in 2002. 
Included in the package are: 
 
-- statistics on all seizures of narcotic drugs and precursor 
chemicals in 2001 and 2002; 
 
-- a status report on all cases prosecuted under Burma\'s 
counternarcotics laws in 2001 and 2002; 
 
-- GPS coordinates for all Burmese eradication programs in 
2001 and 2002; 
 
-- GPS coordinates and case details on all heroin refineries 
destroyed in 2001 and 2002; 
 
-- A listing of all major seizures of narcotics and precursor 
chemicals in 2001 and 2002 with names, dates, and map 
references; 
 
-- Details on the repeated on-site visits made by U.S. and 
UNDCP representatives to opium producing regions in Burma in 
connection with the annual opium surveys done by both the 
United States and UNDCP; and 
 
-- Details on the seizure and destruction of opium poppy 
seeds in 2001 and 2002. 
 
2. (U) The entire package testifies to a strong effort that 
was also documented in our first report (ref B) on Burma\'s 
counternarcotics efforts.  Burma has reduced opium production 
to less than one-quarter of its level in 1996; it has 
cooperated effectively with the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the Australian Federal Police; it has 
established productive cooperative arrangements with China, 
Thailand, and other regional states; it has participated 
effectively in multilateral arrangements organized by UNDCP 
to curb trafficking in the region; it has enacted powerful 
new money laundering legislation under which the first 
prosecutions are already being prepared; and, working in 
particular with China, it has curbed the activities of drug 
gangs operating in cease-fire areas governed by the United Wa 
State Army, the Kokang Chinese, and others.  Even the 
reported decline in seizures of precursor chemicals and 
methamphetamine tablets in 2002 is probably testimony to the 
impact of Chinese/Burmese pressure on drug producing gangs 
that are either being forced out of Burma or shut down 
altogether.  Provided public order holds together here, we 
also believe Burma could be one of the world\'s few outright 
success stories in regards to narcotics control over the next 
half decade.  End Summary. 
 
3. (U) We have faxed copies of the GOB\'s latest report to 
INL/AAE Director Bill Bach and EAP/BCLTV Desk Officer Josh 
Glazeroff.  INL/AAE Southeast Asia desk officer John 
Underriner also carried a copy of these materials back to 
Washington.  The following is the essence of the report: 
 
4. (U) Objective 1 - Drug Traffickers 
 
The GOB has brought more than 4,000 separate cases against 
narcotics traffickers over the past two years; 2,592 of these 
cases were prosecuted in 2001; 1,475 during the first seven 
months of 2002.  Of all these cases, 172 were dismissed for 
lack of sufficient evidence and 259 defendants were 
acquitted.  The remainder (a total of 3,853 over the full 
nineteen months) were convicted.  Six were given the death 
penalty; 137 were given \"unlimited\" sentences; 10 were given 
life sentences; 1,927 were given sentences in excess of 10 
years, and the remainder were given sentences of less than 10 
years. 
 
5. (U) Objective 2 - Eradication, narcotics seizures, and the 
destruction of meth labs and heroin refineries. 
Eradication: The GOB eradicated more than 50,000 acres of 
opium poppy over the past two crop years.  Of this, 26,113 
acres were destroyed during the 2000/01 crop year; 25,862 
hectares during 2001/02.  It has also provided GPS 
coordinates for verification purposes for 44 sites where 
major eradication efforts took place in 2000/01 and/or 
2001/02.  In addition, the GOB burned 164,000 kilos of poppy 
seeds capable of seeding more than 40,000 hectares during the 
six month period between April and October 2002.  According 
to Brigadier General Kyaw Thein, the head of MI\'s 
counternarcotics division, the destruction of those seeds, 
together with continued pressure on the Kokang Chinese and 
other cease-fire groups, should reduce the acreage under 
opium cultivation by about half in 2003. 
 
Monitoring and Verification Visits: USG and/or UNDCP 
personnel visited every major poppy growing district in 
Burma, including every township in Wa controlled areas, as 
part of our opium survey programs in 2002.  Details on the 
complete coverage afforded by the two surveys are available 
in UNDCP\'s Report on its 2002 Opium Survey and the USG\'s 
report on Joint US/Burma Opium Yield Survey.  The complete 
coverage of the UNDCP survey, in particular, accounts for the 
virtually complete agreement between the two surveys on the 
current extent of opium cultivation and its steep decline 
over the past five years.  Similar programs are planned for 
2003. 
 
Seizures: Through October 2002, the GOB has seized 1,631 
kilos of opium, 285 kilos of heroin, 8,832,000 
methamphetamine tablets, and 226 kilos of cannabis.  For all 
of 2001, the numbers were 1,629 kilos of opium, 97 kilos of 
heroin, 32,439,000 methamphetamine tablets, and 284 kilos of 
cannabis. 
 
Refineries: The GOB destroyed fourteen heroin labs in 2001 
and 7 thus far in 2002.  For verification purposes, it has 
provided GPS coordinates on all of these sites.  It has also 
provided details on 6 meth labs that were destroyed during 
the first nine months of 2002. 
 
Precursor Chemicals: In 2002, the Ministry of Health issued 
notification No. 1/2002 identifying 25 substances as 
precursor chemicals and prohibiting their import, sale, or 
use in Burma.  Seizures of precursor chemicals during the 
first nine months of 2002 included 1,220 kilos of ephedrine, 
2,908 kilos of acetic anhydride, and 21,552 kilos of other 
chemicals.  In 2001, the totals were 3,922 kilos of 
ephedrine, 12,318 liters of acetic anhydride, and 174,191 
liters of other chemicals. 
 
6. (U) Objective 3 - International Cooperation 
 
Bilateral Cooperation: Burma\'s counternarcotics cooperation 
with China has expanded dramatically in 2002.  Details are in 
ref B.  In the latest development, on October 15, Burma 
arrested and turned over Li Kyin Kam to Chinese police 
authorities.  Li Kyin Kam was reportedly a major trafficker 
and fugitive from Chinese justice.  Burma has also resumed 
its cooperation with Thailand, which has continued its 
planning for a $400,000 alternative development program 
opposite the Thai border in the vicinity of Tachileik. 
Details of Burmese/Thai law enforcement cooperation will be 
worked out at the upcoming HONLEA meeting in Bangkok. 
Mekong Survey: Planning for the survey has resumed following 
a resolution of the border tensions between Thailand and 
Burma.  Burma has designated a group of 3 officials from the 
Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control to coordinate with 
Chinese, Thai, and Lao officials on the survey. 
Ministerial Level Meeting: Ministerial level drug control 
meetings between Thailand, Laos, and Burma have been held 
every two years since 1992.  Burma will host the next. 
 
Cease-fire Group Liaison Offices: All liaison offices for 
\"national races,\" including all the liaison offices of the 
United Wa State Army and other cease-fire groups, in 
Tachileik, Myawaddy, and Kawthoung have been closed. 
 
7. (U) Objective 4 - Money Laundering 
 
The new money laundering law was passed in June; a Central 
Control Board chaired by the Home Minister was established in 
July; training for financial investigators was conducted 
Rangoon and Mandalay in August and September; the initial 
investigations were begun in October; and the first cases are 
expected to be submitted to the court under the new law 
before the end of the year.  Burma was left on the Financial 
Action Task Force\'s list of non-complying countries in June 
pending implementation of the new law.  Burma will be 
eligible for removal in June 2003. 
 
8. (U) Objective 5 - Bribery and Corruption 
 
Action has been taken against 12 police officers involved in 
five cases of narcotics-related bribery and corruption in 
2002.  Four were given prison terms; one was discharged; four 
were demoted; and three were given official warnings. 
 
9. (U) Objective 6 - Demand Reduction 
 
The Burmese government opened an additional 18 major drug 
treatment centers and 22 drug treatment clinics throughout 
Burma in 2002. 
 
Final Note 
 
10. (C) In a meeting November 1, we passed on to General Kyaw 
Thein the additional information requests (ref F) that had 
emerged from the October 29th meeting in Washington and 
assured him again, as INL Assistant Secretary Rand Beers had 
assured him in Washington, that \"other political issues\" 
would not play a role in the U.S. government\'s decision on 
certification of Burma\'s counternarcotics efforts.  Kyaw 
Thein pointed out that several of the new requests; e.g., 
regarding implementation of Burma\'s money laundering law, had 
been answered by this latest package of materials, but

SUBJECT: NLD STATUS REPORT: SIX MONTHS AFTER ASSK\'S RELEASE 
 
REF: RANGOON 575 AND 578 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  Almost six months after her release from 
house detention, ASSK continues with a disciplined, 
non-confrontational strategy to rebuild her political forces 
while attempting to draw the regime into dialogue on national 
reconciliation.  She has succeeded in reviving NLD 
leadership, reopening offices, and rebuilding ties with other 
political entities, including ethnic groups.  She has 
traveled to various locations outside Rangoon, met with UN, 
NGO and foreign officials, and refined her stance on 
international assistance and other issues.  While carefully 
avoiding any direct criticism of the regime, ASSK has 
expressed her dismay at deteriorating social and economic 
conditions and consistently called on the SPDC to join with 
the NLD in fostering positive change.  She also continues to 
press the SPDC for the release of all political prisoners, 
and restoration of political freedoms for Burma\'s people and 
its political parties.  In sum, ASSK has kept the moral 
pressure on the regime, while slowly but surely expanding the 
political space for political parties and other members of 
the opposition.  However, she has been careful throughout not 
to give the SPDC any reason to end the NLD\'s somewhat 
increased liberties.  End Summary 
 
Building Trust, Rebuilding the Party 
 
2. (SBU)  The May 6 release of Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK), after 
almost 19 months of house detention (reftels), was expected 
to mark the end of confidence building and the beginning of 
substantive dialogue on national reconciliation between her 
party, the National League for Democracy, and the ruling 
junta, the State Peace and Development council (SPDC). 
Unfortunately, the SPDC has not responded to the NLD and 
international community\'s calls for dialogue, political 
reform, and the release of all political prisoners.  It has, 
however, released about 158 political prisoners since May. 
At the same time, SPDC economic policies are creating greater 
hardships throughout the country.  The SPDC also began 
arresting and sentencing political activists in greater 
numbers than it had since confidence-building talks began in 
October 2000.  Altogether, about 45 persons were detained in 
August and September, although about half of these were 
subsequently released.  Meanwhile, ASSK has maintained a 
well-disciplined, non-confrontational strategy to rebuild her 
political forces while attempting to draw the SPDC into 
dialogue. 
 
3. (SBU)  In the first few weeks after ASSK,s May 6 release, 
government officials harassed some of the individuals and 
organizations that she visited.  She was prohibited from 
visiting government projects, UN organizations were warned 
not to meet with her, and staff of an international NGO were 
harassed after her visit to their project site.  Discreetly 
and patiently, ASSK worked with military intelligence (MI) to 
address these and other actions that contradicted the 
government\'s commitment to allow her freedom of movement. 
 
4. (SBU)  ASSK has also kept her own party under control. 
She has prohibited any NLD criticism of the SPDC.  The NLD 
made no public mention of the limitations on her movements or 
harassment of those with whom she met.  When she traveled to 
project sites and witnessed the desperate conditions people 
live under she made no public criticism of the SPDC. 
Instead, she cited the conditions as an imperative for the 
SPDC, NLD, and others to work together to address the needs 
of the people.  Even when the SPDC arrested NLD youth in 
Rangoon for carrying illegal literature and NLD leaders in 
Shan State for \"acts against the state,\" she did not speak 
out except to insist that they receive legal representation 
and due process. 
 
5. (SBU)  ASSK also avoided any public criticism of the SPDC 
on human rights issues including the allegations of military 
rapes in Shan State.  Despite rumors of some grumbling within 
the NLD over this conciliatory stance, ASSK has enforced 
strict party discipline.  As a result, there have been no 
instances of lower level leaders or members publicly 
criticizing the regime. 
 
Pressure Builds for Action 
 
6. (SBU)  While ASSK has used the time since her release to 
travel to five locations in states and divisions to reopen 
party offices (now up to 66 out of 330) and rebuild party 
organization, she has also had to contend with increasing 
internal and international pressure for a change in the 
decade old political stalemate between the NLD and the SPDC. 
The international community viewed her release with optimism 
and donor countries, the UN, and NGOs began positioning for 
increased assistance to the country.  At the same time, the 
increasingly dire humanitarian crisis in Burma put pressure 
on ASSK to agree to increased levels of humanitarian support. 
 With no real political progress, however, she has emphasized 
that foreign assistance would be welcome only if it did not 
directly benefit the SPDC and was carefully targeted and 
monitored to ensure that it reached the people.  Based on 
this criteria, she has endorsed HIV/AIDS funding by the U.S. 
($1m to international NGOs) and the U.K. ($15 million to UN 
agencies and international NGO,s) and other discrete 
assistance projects in the country. 
 
7. (SBU)  ASSK has also faced pressure from ethnic groups who 
support the NLD but who want their interests represented in 
any dialogue with the SPDC.  Shortly after her release ASSK 
met with ethnic leaders and convinced them that dialogue with 
the SPDC must begin with the NLD and later, at an appropriate 
stage, expand to include ethnic groups.  She reassured them 
that the NLD would be negotiating for all the people of 
Burma, not just the NLD constituency.  Special Envoy Razali 
also advocated this approach, and encouraged ethnic leaders 
to meet and develop common positions so they would be 
prepared when tripartite dialogue began.  As months went by 
and the SPDC failed to initiate dialogue with the NLD, ethnic 
groups became increasingly frustrated by the lack of 
progress. 
 
The CRPP: A Shift in Tactics? 
 
8. (SBU)  On October 23 the NLD and ethnic parties announced 
the expansion of the Committee Representing the Peoples, 
Parliament (CRPP), a Committee the SPDC views as a direct 
challenge to its legitimacy.  The CRPP, after all, had 
declared when it was founded in 1998 that the SPDC was not 
the legitimate government and that the CRPP would act as a 
parliamentary body until the military allowed a return to an 
elected government.  Widespread arrests of Members of 
Parliament-elect and political activists (some of whom remain 
in prison) followed. 
 
9. (SBU)  The revival and expansion of the CRPP now (to 
include leaders of four ethnic parties that received a 
substantial number of ethnic votes in the 1990 elections) 
appears to be a calculated move to consolidate ethnic support 
behind the NLD, facilitate coordination among the ethnic 
groups and the NLD, and prod the SPDC toward substantive 
dialogue.  Apparently, ASSK believes changed circumstances 
will prevent another crackdown similar to the one in 1998. 
She has demonstrated that she can maintain confidentiality in 
her discussions with the SPDC, that she can maintain party 
discipline to work constructively with the regime, and that 
she enjoys the support of at least some ethnic leaders. 
Apparently, ASSK hopes this will be enough to deter the SPDC 
from initiating a new round of political arrests. 
 
Next Steps.... 
 
10. (SBU)  While there is no sign that the SPDC is yet moving 
toward substantive dialogue with the NLD on constitutional 
issues, deteriorating economic conditions and international 
pressure for change may combine to spur the regime in that 
direction.  Special Envoy Razali will return to Rangoon on 
November 12 and will likely call for the SPDC to follow 
through on its earlier commitments to work with the NLD, 
increase political freedoms, and release political prisoners. 
 The international community is also pressing the regime for 
political reforms to address reports of human rights abuses 
and the looming humanitarian crisis.  Many here believe the 
SPDC has backed itself into a corner with its poor management 
of the economy.  In any case, the NLD has continued to press 
for change, albeit quietly. 
 
11. (SBU)  Looking ahead, however, there must be questions as 
to how long the current disciplined dialogue will endure 
without real progress on central issues.  Unquestionably, the 
continued confidence-building has been welcome.  Given the 
hate that has built up in Burma over the past 60 years, there 
will be scope for additional confidence-building between all 
the communities for at least the next several generations. 
Nevertheless, unless all parties are soon showed a goal, and 
a road map for democratic change, then even the small measure 
of goodwill that has been built up between the government and 
the opposition could be washed away.  Both sides seem to 
recognize this, but both must equally be willing to act on 
critical issues.  ASSK now is ready to act.  We have seen no 
indication, however, that the SPDC is willing to meet her, 
even halfway.

1. (SBU) Summary:  The regime\'s continued mismanagement of 
the Burmese economy has given another push to its downward 
slide in recent months.  The government\'s increasing reliance 
on trade restrictions, rather than fiscal and monetary policy 
measures, has slashed imports and halted temporarily the 
plummeting of the kyat.  However, this hamfisted approach 
will leave key structural issues completely unaddressed and, 
in the long run, do more harm than good.  End summary. 
 
Trade: \'Tis Better to Give than Receive 
 
2. (U) GOB trade figures for the first half of 2002 reflect 
an improving trade balance for Burma.  According to 
government statistics, exports have risen about 10.5 percent 
while imports have plummeted over 35 percent.  As a result, 
the government can brag of the first trade surplus in many 
years.  However, the reality for the economy is much more 
negative. 
 
3. (SBU) The decline in imports reflects a number of factors 
-- including the closure of the Thai border for several 
months over the summer.  Even more significantly, however, 
the government has actively discouraged imports over the past 
year in hopes of conserving foreign exchange.  In recent 
weeks, import requests, all of which must be cleared at the 
highest levels, have been regularly denied or edited.  The 
government requires that all foreign exchange spent on 
imports be offset by export earnings.  Also, according to a 
1998 regulation, 80 percent of an entity\'s imports must be 
off a government-approved list of \"essential\" items -- a list 
that frequently changes and often has little to do with what 
is truly essential to the economy. 
 
4. (SBU) Exports rose during the same period largely because 
of Burma\'s increasing role as an exporter of seafood and a 
strong early showing for rice exports.  However, exports for 
the full year may sink due to a sharp decline in exports of 
garments and textiles to the United States and growing 
questions over the availability of rice stocks.  Reliable 
sources have told us that rice warehouse managers sold much 
of their stock when prices started to rise, expecting to buy 
it all back when prices fell.  Continuing high prices have 
made this impossible.  As a result, exports are being pinched 
during the second half of 2002.  For the government, the 
choice will be between fulfilling export goals and keeping 
the people fed.  As in the past, we expect the government to 
choose political stability over exports. 
 
Inflation: Countdown to Blast Off 
 
5. (SBU) Inflation, meanwhile, will worsen in upcoming months 
as import controls are felt.  During the August-October 
period, the overall consumer price index rose 7.4 percent 
(with the CPI of imports leading the way with a nearly 10 
percent jump).  The price of key edible staples rose even 
faster, with rice up 14.3 percent, beans up an average of 10 
percent, and fish paste up 12.5 percent. 
 
6. (SBU) Official import limitations, of course, have only a 
partial impact on the supply of goods.  Despite government 
efforts to crack down on illicit as well as legal imports, a 
robust black market in consumer goods and other imported 
materials has always managed to keep consumers and producers 
well supplied.  However, as in the past, prices will increase 
across the board, reflecting the risks and costs associated 
with smuggling and black marketing. 
 
Exchange Rate:  Riding the Roller Coaster 
 
7. (SBU) The dollar rate for the kyat has gyrated wildly 
during the past three months.  After hitting an all-time high 
of 1310 kyat to the dollar on September 25, the kyat 
appreciated nearly 24 percent to 1000 kyat/dollar by the end 
of October, before again dropping to about 1075 kyat/dollar. 
 
8. (SBU) There are at least three reasons for the short-term 
strengthening of the kyat.  First, the military-controlled 
Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd. (UMEHL) lost its 
lucrative right to import diesel and cooking oil.  Because 
UMEHL, unlike other importers, was not required to pay for 
its imports with export earnings, the holding company had 
been a major consumer of black market dollars.  With its 
operations now curtailed, the demand for foreign exchange in 
the black market has fallen sharply.  Second, the authorities 
cracked down on the widely popular, but illegal, gambling 
networks.  The organizers of these gambling rings were large 
consumers of black market dollars, daily changing their large 
kyat earnings into dollars (in effect funding capital 
flight).  Finally, seasonal factors have played a role, 
including a demand for kyat to fund harvest purchases, and an 
influx of foreign exchange as the tourist season gets 
underway. 
 
9. (SBU) The kyat\'s recent strength, of course, will not 
endure, if only because the currency will shortly have to 
cope not only with the nearly inevitable breakdown of the 
government\'s trade controls, but also with the irresistible 
force of the government\'s annual budget financing, which is 
felt most clearly in the months from February through April. 
Each year at that time, the GOB drops several hundred billion 
kyat into the market, with a predictable impact on the kyat\'s 
value against all other currencies. 
 
Investment: Bottoming Out 
 
10. (U) The foreign investment situation could not be worse. 
During the first half of 2002, investment was down 97 percent 
from the same period a year earlier.  During the first half 
of 2002 there was only a single approved investment, by a 
Hong Kong textiles firm, for a mere $1.5 million.  Opaque 
policymaking, corruption, government interference, and a 
generally bad investment climate were the prime factors 
behind the decline.  This year, as a result, seems a total 
loss.  However, the numbers could get a small bump up next 
year from expected investment in mining in the north, and in 
the off-shore energy sector. 
 
Comment 
 
11. (SBU) Watching the GOB manage the Burmese economy is like 
watching a man trying to tie his shoes with one hand.  The 
GOB has only one policy tool -- trade restrictions (coupled 
with arrests) -- that it knows how to use at all, and it uses 
that tool in every contingency.  Prices too high?  Restrict 
trade!  Kyat depreciating?  Restrict trade (and arrest 
people)!  Investment falling?  Restrict trade (and 
investment)!  Never, ever, however, is there any effort to 
develop some balance in the government\'s fiscal operations, 
or any restraint in regard to monetary policy.  Given that 
approach, there is really little one can expect except 
increasing financial imbalances, soaring prices, and 
eventually collapsing production.  Sad to say, but that is 
the future of the Burmese economy.  End comment.

TAGS: SNAR, EAID, BM, ADB 
SUBJECT: U.S. SANCTIONS: DIRECTED AT BURMA OR THE REGION? 
 
 
1. This is an action message.  See paragraph 9. 
 
2. Summary: The United States is now poised to oppose an ADB 
regional grant for alternative development in the Greater 
Mekong Subregion (GMS) on the grounds that Burma-specific 
legislation applies to all such regional grants.  That 
position will have wide ramifications, potentially crippling 
the ADB\'s ability to support GMS loans and grants. It will 
also undercut regional support for U.S. sanctions policy on 
Burma and damage U.S. efforts to promote donor support for 
alternative development projects in Southeast Asia.  That was 
not the intent of the Burma legislation, but it will be the 
effect, if the USG does not review and reverse the proposed 
decision on the ADB grant.  End Summary. 
 
3. The ADB\'s Executive Board will shortly take up a proposed 
$2 million technical assistance grant for cooperation on 
alternative development for drug control in the Greater 
Mekong Subregion.  As its name implies, the grant will 
promote sub-regional cooperation in major opium producing 
areas.  It has three basic components.  The grant will help 
implement the joint China/ASEAN ACCORD plan of action on drug 
control, assist in monitoring opium production, and promote 
alternative development activities, including food security, 
health and education programs, crop diversification, and 
improved land use planning.  In Burma specifically, the 
technical assistance would pick up activities from the Wa 
Alternative Development Project that were cut when that 
project was downsized in 2000. 
 
4. This grant would directly support U.S. alternative 
development initiatives in Southeast Asia.  Over the past 
five years, the United States has been the strongest 
supporter of alternative development activities in the Golden 
Triangle.  In Burma alone, the United States has contributed 
over three-quarters of the donor funding for the Wa 
Alternative Development project, a total of over $8 million 
since 1998.  We have also lobbied strongly for broader donor 
support for these programs, with some success.  Since 2000, 
Japan has scaled up its support for alternative development 
programs in Burma from an original grant of $500,000 to 
$700,000 in 2001 and $1.673 million in 2002, almost $1 
million more than we will contribute this year.  In 2002, 
Germany became the third major donor to join up, putting up 
$1.25 for alternative development in the Wa territories. 
Meanwhile, Thailand and China have begun planning for their 
own alternative development programs with Burma. 
 
5. These projects, moreover, have been successful.  The Wa 
Alternative Development Project in particular has contributed 
to a sharp reduction in opium cultivation in the project 
area.  It has also helped eliminate leprosy from the project 
area, established new health and education facilities, and 
helped close a food deficit which has always been a prime 
motivating factor for opium production by village farmers. 
In addition, it has opened a window on the Wa territories for 
foreign observers, exposed the Wa to concerted international 
pressure regarding drug trafficking, and directly supported 
Burma\'s nationwide drug control program, which has reduced 
opium production by more than 75 percent over the poast six 
years; i.e., from an estimated 2,560 metric tons in 1996 to 
only 630 metric tons last year. 
 
6. Despite this success, the United States is now proposing 
to frustrate the ADB\'s efforts to get involved in alternative 
development in Southeast Asia by voting against the proposed 
regional grant.  Essentially, that decision was based on some 
Burma-specific legislation that directs the Secretary of 
Treasury to instruct the USEDs at all IFIs to vote against 
\"any loan or other utilization of funds .... to or for 
Burma.\"  In this case, however, the proposed grant is not \"to 
or for Burma,\" alone.  In fact, the Government of Burma will 
never see a cent of the money.  Rather, the grant will be 
distributed through UNDCP for use in countries throughout the 
sub-region, including China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and 
Cambodia.  As a consequence, a \"no\" vote in this case will 
have widespread ramifications.  Not only will it undercut our 
efforts to promote alternative development in the Golden 
Triangle, it will also effectively extend Burma-specific 
sanctions to the entire Greater Mekong sub-region, 
potentially outlawing any lending by the World Bank, the ADB, 
or any other IFI to any type of regional project from which 
Burma might benefit in any way. 
 
7. Such a vote would also inevitably undercut regional 
support for our Burma policy.  Our sanctions policy, after 
all, is intended to punish Burma, not its neighbors.  If we 
persist now in extending those sanctions to all regional 
collectives in which Burma participates, we will risk 
alienating the very front line states whose support we need 
if sanctions are to be effective.  The point is critical and 
worth emphasizing.  There is no better way to undercut 
regional support for our Burma policy than to apply our 
sanctions collectively to all regional states.  That, 
however, will be the effect of U.S. votes against regional 
projects. 
 
8. In short, the proposed U.S. decision to vote no on the ADB 
grant can result in crippling the ability of IFIs to support 
GMS loans and grants; it will undercut regional support for 
U.S. sanctions policy on Burma; and it will damage U.S. 
efforts to promote donor support for alternative development 
projects in Southeast Asia. None of this was the intent of 
the original Burma legislation; however, it will be the 
effect and the USG should take time now to step back and 
review its proposed decision on this ADB grant. 
 
9. Action requested: A \"yes\" vote on the ADB\'s grant for 
alternative development in the Greater Mekong Subregion.

1. In response to our request (ref D), the Government of 
Burma has provided a third package of information on its 
counternarcotics program.  The latest package includes an 
outline of measures that the GOB has taken to implement its 
new money laundering law, a list of members of the United Wa 
State Army who have been arrested on narcotics during 2002 
and the names and case histories of police officers who have 
been prosecuted for narcotics-related corruption during 2002. 
 Copies of this information have been forwarded to INL/AAE 
and EAP/BCLTV.  The main points are as follows. 
 
Money Laundering 
 
2. Burma enacted its new money laundering law on June 17.  On 
July 4, it established an eleven member Central Control Board 
chaired by the Minister of Home Affairs to oversee 
implementation of the new law.  Draft regulations for the new 
law were developed in workshops conducted by the Central 
Committee for Drug Abuse Control and the Attorney General\'s 
office in workshops in Rangoon and Mandalay in August and 
September.  In July, 35 financial investigators were trained 
with assistance from the Australian Federal Police and 
others, before being formed up into two financial 
investigation teams.  Those teams have since begun 
investigations of several specific cases on which indictments 
on money laundering charges are expected within the next 
thirty days.  DEA officers in Rangoon have been involved in 
developing one of these cases and can corroborate Burmese 
statements regarding the investigations and the GOB\'s plans 
for prosecutions. 
 
UWSA Cases 
 
3. The GOB has provided a list of 18 members of the United Wa 
State Army who have been arrested in 2002 on 
narcotics-related charges.  The list includes the name and 
address of each culprit, a summary of the case and an 
indication of the sentence that was dished out.  Amounts 
seized in the cases range from the very large (33 kilograms 
of heroin) to the very small (190 methamphetamine tablets). 
None of the arrestees appears particularly high ranking, 
though recent cases included the son of a UWSA township 
commander, and members of the UWSA\'s  418th and 468th 
divisions.  The full list is as follows: 
 
-- On 10/19/02, NYI MI of Nam Kham Township, Burma was 
arrested for possession of .002 kilograms of heroin.  The 
drugs were located and seized following a routine vehicle 
inspection near the village of Kon Naung in Thit Naung Pin 
Township.  NYI MI is currently pending trial. 
 
-- On 10/4/02, .002 kilograms of heroin were seized from the 
personal belongings of AIK SAY of Lashio Township.  The 
seizure was made after AIK SAY was stopped and question by 
the police.  AIK SAY is currently awaiting trial. 
 
-- On 9/4/02, AIK SAN, son of a UWSA Township Commander, was 
arrested at the Asia World Checkpoint in Kutkai Township. 
AIK SAN was arrested for possession of 190 methamphetamine 
tablets and currently awaits trial. 
 
-- On 8/12/02, UWSA Division 468 member KYA LAW was arrested 
by police authorities after two (2) kilograms of opium were 
seized from a false compartment inside the vehicle occupied 
by KYA LAW.  KYA LAW is awaiting trial. 
 
-- On 8/10/02 UWSA member TUN AG of Muse, Burma was arrested 
while in possession of 930 methamphetamine tablets in Man 
Wane Ward, Muse.  TUN AG awaits trial. 
-- On 8/2/02, .00015 kilograms of opium were seized from AIK 
AUNG of Tan Yang Township, Burma.  AIK AUNG was stopped and 
questioned by the police after acting suspiciously.  AIK AUNG 
is currently pending trial. 
 
-- On 7/31/02, Burmese authorities arrested AIK KWAT of 
Lashio Township for possession .001 kilograms of heroin. 
Authorities arrested the defendant following the seizure of 
the heroin on the defendant\'s person.  AIK KWAT was sentenced 
to twelve (12) years imprisonment. 
-- On 7/2/02, 33 kilograms of heroin was seized from within a 
vehicle containing a false compartment.  Defendant AIK YI was 
identified as the driver for the UWSA Division 418.  AIK YI 
currently awaits trial. 
 
-- On 6/7/02, 10,000 methamphetamine tablets were seized from 
UWSA member AIK KET.  Authorities also arrested O PHAT PA MOK 
and two unnamed Thai nationals in connection with the 
seizure.  All four defendants are awaiting trial. 
 
-- On 5/9/02, three defendants were arrested following the 
execution of a search warrant in Hopan Township, Burma. 
Burmese authorities located and seized 26 methamphetamine 
tablets and .001 kilograms of heroin.  Defendants NYI MYAT, 
MA EI NWE and MA EI PA LOT are pending trial. 
 
-- On 5/7/02, AIK GWAN of Hopan Township, Burma was arrested

Corruption 
 
4. In September (see ref A), the GOB advised us that 200 
police officials and 48 army personnel had been disciplined 
for narcotics-related corruption or drug abuse between 
January 1995 and May 2002.  It has now provided the names and 
case details of twelve police officers who were disciplined 
for narcotics related corruption in 2001 and 2002.  Those 
cases are as follows: 
 
-- On 4/9/02, Police Inspector AUNG WIN was dismissed from 
the Myanmar Police Force following a complaint filed by a 
victim that the officer received a bribe for selling opium 
and concealing evidence in gambling, assault, disorderly 
conduct, and sexual assault investigations. 
 
-- On 3/24/02, Police Inspectors WIN NAING, WAI LWIN TUN, 
AUNG ZAW MIN, and Police Corporal ZAW WIN were demoted to the 
next rank and a two years time limit imposed for promotion 
eligibility following the execution of a unwarranted search 
of a residence.  A formal complaint was filed after no 
narcotics were located at the residence and the officers 
demanded and received Kyats 50,000 (approximately $50.00) for 
transportation charges of the suspect to police headquarters. 
 
-- On 11/14/01, Police Inspector MYO MYINT and Sergeants AUNG 
THAN HTAY and NYUNT WIN were formally reprimanded after 
giving false testimony during the trial of two drug suspects. 
  The drug suspects were acquitted on all charges. 
 
-- On 2/9/2001, Police Inspectors MOE SWE, KHIN HTUN and 
Police Corporal THAUNG TUN WIN were arrested by the Yangon 
Division for substituting an arrested narcotics violator with 
another individual for an undisclosed quantity of currency. 
All three defendants were dismissed from the Myanmar Police 
Force on 1/12/02 and sentenced to ten (10) years for 
accepting the bribe and ten (10) years in violation of 
Anti-Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances Laws.  The 
sentences will be served consecutively. 
 
-- On 10/9/00, Police Inspector TIN MAUNG OO of the Pabetan 
Township Police Station was dismissed from the Myanmar Police 
Force and sentenced on 8/28/00 to three (3) months of 
rigorous imprisonment after demanding money from a drug 
suspect. 
 
Comment 
 
5.  The GOB has responded promptly to all of our requests for 
information on 
on its counternarcotics program.  If there is other specific 
information that the Department requires for its decision on 
certification of Burma\'s program, or other issues connected 
with the criteria for certification, please advise ASAP so 
that post can make an immediate approach to the GOB or other 
sources and obtain the required data.

SUBJECT: RAZALI: CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD CASE 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Razali told diplomats at an early evening 
briefing today that the dialog between the NLD and the SPDC 
appeared to be stalled as much by a personality conflict 
between Aung San Suu Kyi and Than Shwe as anything else. 
Each one is imperious in his own way and neither is ready to 
compromise.  The visit also made clear that Than Shwe was the 
decision-maker in Burma; any commitments made by Khin Nyunt 
had to be confirmed by Than Shwe.  That said, Khin Nyunt had 
broached the idea of reconvening a reformulated National 
Convention -- a suggestion that is apparently acceptable, at 
least in principle, to both ASSK and the ethnic parties. 
Khin Nyunt also suggested that 200 to 300 additional 
political prisoners and security detainees could be released 
by the close of the year, though, again, as with all other 
matters, Than Shwe failed to confirm the commitment. Finally, 
Razali confirmed that he would continue as Special Envoy, 
with his next visit possibly occurring early next year. End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) UN Special Envoy Razali told diplomats November 15 
that he would continue in his role as facilitator for the 
talks between the NLD and the GOB.  He was, he said, 
beginning to get a feel for \"the complexities of the 
situation\".  He had met with Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, Aung San 
Suu Kyi representatives of the ethnic communities and Senior 
General Than Shwe and understood now that there were at least 
\"two levels of decision-making\" within the SPDC.  Any 
commitments by Khin Nyunt had to be confirmed by Senior 
General Than Shwe.  Furthermore, there was probably blame on 
both sides for the lack of progress on the dialogue. 
 
3. (C) Razali described his meeting with Khin Nyunt as \"very 
good, very candid and very relaxed.\"  Razali took Khin Nyunt 
up on his failure to deliver on his August promise to Razali 
regarding the start of real dialog. Khin Nyunt said he was 
doing his best, trying to act \"as a catalyst between the NLD 
and the SPDC.\"\' However, every aspect of exchanges with the 
NLD were examined every week in detail by the SPDC.  As a 
result, it was difficult to move forward on anything.  Khin 
Nyunt also told Razali that there was \"a channel of 
discussion\" between the NLD and the SPDC.  The Minister of 
Education (a cousin of Than Shwe, he is also Secretary 
General of the USDA), the Deputy Minister of Information and 
Brigadier General Than Thun had met four times with Aung San 
Suu Kyi in \"round table discussions\" which Khin Nyunt 
described as \"positive and constructive.\"  in the same 
breath, however, he also complained that ASSK had to take the 
discussions more seriously.  Seemingly, she was disdainful of 
both the participants and the topics on the table.  In fact, 
Razali said, when he met with her, she was scornful of the 
meetings with the Minister of Education et al. 
 
4. (C) Khin Nyunt also told Razali that he is prepared to 
reconvene the National Convention with adjustments in its 
rules and procedures, though, when pushed on what adjustments 
would be made, was vague.  Similarly, Khin Nyunt also 
suggested that as many as 300 additional political prisoners 
and security detainees could be released before the close of 
the year. Aung San Suu Kyi, Razali said, agreed that the NLD 
would rejoin a properly reformulated National Convention. 
According to Razali, representatives of ethnic parties also 
accepted the idea of a reconvened Convention. 
 
5. (C) Than Shwe gave Razali only fifteen minutes, but that 
was enough to convince Razali that Khin Nyunt and Than Shwe 
were not always on the same page.  Than Shwe for instance did 
not commit to reconvening the National Convention and, 
according to Razali, even now he cannot say whether or not 
the GOB will go that route.  Similarly, when the topic turned 
to consultations with the NLD regarding humanitarian 
assistance for Burma -- an idea which Khin Nyunt had accepted 
-- Than Shwe, while not saying a word, gave every indication 
of acute discomfort.  He also failed to confirm Khin Nyunt\'s 
commitment on the release of political prisoners.  The most 
he would say is that he would \"do the best for the country.\" 
Than Shwe also vetoed Razali\'s final meeting with Aung San 
Suu Kyi, which had been scheduled for Taungyi in Shan State, 
where she is traveling on NLD business.  According to Than 
Shwe, ASSK was on a \"political tour\" and any meeting by 
Razali with her while she was on that tour would show undue 
favoritism for the NLD. 
 
6. (C) In general, Razali concluded that the relationship 
between ASSK and Than Shwe was extremely difficult.  There 
was a great deal of suspicion of ASSK\'s activities and 
apparently Than Shwe felt that somehow, somewhere ASSK had 
offended him on two occasions, though nobody would say 
exactly what the offense was.  As for ASSK, she simply had a 
\"hard personality\" that Than Shwe (and others) had difficulty 
dealing with. 
 
7. (C) On other topics, Razali said that he had been warned 
not to raise Burma\'s economic situation with Than Shwe. 
Presumably, the senior general had gotten an earful from 
other ASEAN members during the ASEAN summit in Phnom Penh. 
He also suggested that he might be back in January or 
February for what will be his tenth visit.

SUBJECT: THE ILO: SLOWLY ESTABLISHING A WORKING PRESENCE IN 
BURMA 
 
REF: GENEVA 4706 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  The new ILO liaison officer in Rangoon met 
with Secretary One General Khin Nyunt this week and received 
assurances that the SPDC would work with the ILO to address 
problems with forced labor.  She was also told that she can 
travel freely anywhere she wants in Burma.  These assurances 
and the establishment of the new ILO office in Rangoon are 
positive steps, but the GOB has not yet presented an 
acceptable plan of action on forced labor.  The ILO office in 
Rangoon is looking for clear direction from next week\'s ILO 
Governing Body meeting to reinforce its efforts in regard to 
the plan of action.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C)  ILO Rangoon\'s Deputy Liaison Officer Richard Horsey 
told Poloffs on November 15 that the ILO\'s new liaison 
officer, Ms. Nguyen-Perret, met with Secretary One General 
Khin Nyunt, Home Affairs Minister Tin Hlaing, and the GOB\'s 
Implementation Committee on Forced Labor during the past 
week.  Earlier, she had also met with Minister of Labor Tin 
Win.  The meeting with Secretary One was positive, according 
to Horsey; where S-1 had once denied any instances of forced 
labor, he now admitted that it had once been government 
policy to \"ask for\" labor contributions.  S-1 said that 
regulations against forced labor had now been issued; 
however, there were still problems, particularly in the 
border areas.  Horsey said that this was a remarkable change 
of position, which reflected the government\'s evolving 
understanding of the forced labor issue.  S-1 also told Ms. 
Nguyen-Perret that she was free to travel anywhere she chose 
in Burma. 
 
3. (C)  Horsey said he and Ms. Nguyen-Perret had only taken 
one trip so far, a one-day trip to Kyauktan, a small town 
just east of Rangoon (and, coincidentally, Khin Nyunt\'s home 
town).  The pair had not investigated allegations of forced 
labor on the visit but they did find copies of the 
government\'s ordinances on forced labor prominently posted in 
two locations.  In the future, they plan to travel widely, 
beginning with a weeklong trip in December.  Horsey said the 
ILO team will give the government one-day notice of their 
travel plans, except when they plan to meet with government 
officials, in which case they will give more notice. 
 
4. (C)  ILO Rangoon is now negotiating for a visit by an ILO 
High Level Team to work out the details of a GOB plan of 
action to deal with forced labor.  The local office wants 
enough antecedent progress on the plan to make the team\'s 
trip worthwhile.  It is pushing the government to have 
something ready for the team as soon as possible, but no 
later than January or February, i.e., in time for the plan to 
be taken into consideration at the March Governing Board 
meeting. 
 
5. (C)  Horsey stated that the plan of action should include 
the following three elements: 
 
-- an investigation mechanism that would cover both the 
military and the wider civilian population.  The problem now 
is that the GOB\'s Implementation Committee on forced labor 
does not have access to or influence over the military, where 
most forced labor problems occur.  In the future, either the 
military would have to be included in the committee or, 
better, a mechanism would have to be set up to utilize the 
military\'s inspector general and/or the adjutant general to 
enforce the government\'s rules on forced labor.  In addition, 
the procedures of the Implementation Committee would have to 
be reformed.  Right now, the Committee was not making any 
record of any of its investigations and, in fact, was not 
effectively pursuing cases; 
 
-- a nationwide presence for the ILO, with mechanisms for 
receiving complaints, and for disseminating information on 
forced labor through pamphlets, training, etc.; 
-- a portfolio of ILO supported technical assistance projects 
that would teach the government how to deal with development 
issues at the village level without resort to forced labor. 
 
6. (C) Horsey noted that the government has been pushing for 
ILO technical assistance projects while putting the other two 
elements on hold.  He has responded that the first two 
elements need to be in place before any meaningful technical 
assistance projects can begin. 
 
7. (C)  Horsey did not expect any dramatic developments at 
the upcoming Governing Body meeting.  The GOB was pushing for 
\"a reinterpretation\" of the 1999 ILO resolution on Burma to 
allow the ILO to provide technical assistance in areas other 
than forced labor.  The ILO mission here, however, has told 
the government that this was the wrong approach.  Horsey said 
ILO Rangoon has told the government that there was already 
plenty of latitude to receive technical assistance for 
critical labor issues within the guidelines laid down by the 
1999 resolution.  There was no need for a revision. 
Moreover, he told the government that most ILO members would 
view any GOB effort to reinterpret the 1999 resolution with 
suspicion. 
 
8. (C)  Horsey said ILO Rangoon was looking for clear 
direction from the Governing Body on next steps with Burma 
such as an approved action plan.  This would give the office 
something specific to work on with the GOB prior to the next 
GB meeting in March.   He said there was no need for any 
change in any of the Burma resolutions, but a recognition of 
the steps the GOB has taken, together with a clear 
endorsement of the ILO\'s concept of an appropriate plan of 
action would be welcome.

SUBJECT: GOB RELEASES 115 POLITICAL PRISONERS 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: The GOB released another 115 political 
prisoners on November 21.  The NLD has received the names of 
50 NLD members who were released as well as one other who 
military intelligence mistakenly identified as an NLD member. 
 ICRC received all 115 names.  This brings the total number 
of political prisoners released since the talks began between 
the NLD and the government to about 550, of which more than 
400 have been NLD members.  According to NLD spokesman U 
Lwin, only about 110 NLD members remain in prison. End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) The National League for Democracy\'s spokesman, U Lwin, 
told Poloff November 22 that his contacts in military 
intelligence had provided him last night with a list of 51 
supposed NLD members who had been released as part of the 
GOB\'s announced release of 115 political prisoners on 
November 21.  According to U Lwin, 50 of the 51 were indeed 
NLD members, though none were particularly high-ranking. 
Most were \"students\" (actually individuals who were now 30 to 
40 years old after spending years in prison), including the 
one non-NLD member, who had been swept up with a group of NLD 
members at the time of their original arrest.  Otherwise, the 
group included only one member of an NLD state-wide executive 
committee and \'two or three\" township committee members. 
None of the 16 NLD MPs were released; neither were any other 
high profile prisoners (NLD or not) part of the release. 
 
3. (C) U Lwin said that the latest releases, when completely 
confirmed, would bring the total number of political 
prisoners released since the start of the talks between Aung 
San Suu Kyi and the military to about 550, of which more than 
400 were members of the NLD.  Altogether, he said, there are 
now only about 110 NLD members still in detention, though 
that group includes many major figures, including U Win Tin 
and the 16 NLD MPs. 
 
4. (C) U Lwin noted that some of the press stories on the 
releases stated that 57 NLD members had been released.  So 
far as he knew, that was not true, but he feared that some 
NLD members might have been offered their release, but 
refused to sign the warning given every paroled prisoner. 
That warning stated that released prisoners could be made to 
serve the remainder of their sentences, if arrested again on 
similar charges.  U Lwin said that the NLD had told the 
prisoners that this was not a pledge of good behavior; it was 
simply part of the procedures for release and that no 
released prisoners had ever yet been re-arrested. 
Nevertheless, some prisoners still refused to sign the 
warning.  Hence his concern about the discrepancy in numbers. 
 
 
4. (C) ICRC\'s protection officer, Christophe Hartmann, told 
Poloff that ICRC had received a list of 115 prisoners who had 
been released from various prisons throughout Burma on 
November 21.  However, the released prisoners had not yet 
checked in with ICRC.  Only when the prisoners had checked in 
would ICRC be prepared to say that the full release had taken 
place. 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C) In this case, DCI, the Burmese public relations firm, 
appears to have gotten its facts right.  Apparently, the GOB 
did release 115 prisoners November 21 though it may take some 
days to fully confirm that number.  According to U Lwin, the 
release was probably timed to coincide with the UN\'s 
consideration of the resolution on Burma and the upcoming 
SAIS conference on Burma in Washington.  It may also have 
been the first tranche of the 200 to 300 political prisoners 
Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt told Razali the government may release

Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1.  (S) Summary:  An official Burmese delegation headed by 
the Minister of Forestry traveled to Baghdad in March and 
concluded agreements to cooperate with the Government of Iraq 
on trade, banking and finance, oil and gas, scientific 
research and technical issues, and in other areas.  The 
agreed minutes of the Burma-Iraq meetings, marked \"Secret\" by 
the GOB, were presented to the Government of Burma in October 
and obtained by Post in November.  A copy will be pouched to 
EAP/BCLTV.  End Summary. 
 
2. (S) The 4-6 March 2002 Baghdad meetings were an outgrowth 
of the \"Agreement on Trade, Economic, Scientific and 
Technical Cooperation between the Government of the Union of 
Myanmar and the Government of the Republic of Iraq\" signed on 
6 August 2001 in Baghdad, according to this document. 
 
-- The seven-person Burmese delegation was lead by Aung 
Phone, Minister of Forestry, and included the deputy minister 
of energy, the Burmese ambassador to Egypt, and the managing 
director of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd, a large 
state-owned conglomerate. 
 
--  The 23-member Iraqi side was led by the Minister of 
Planning, Dr. Hassan Al-Khattab.  The Burmese delegation was 
also \"received by\" Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadhan, 
Deputy Prime Minister Hekmat Al-Azawi and the ministers of 
finance, trade, oil, and agriculture. 
 
3. (S) The vague and wide-ranging agreement included pledges 
to cooperate in such benign fields as honeybee breeding and 
garbage disposal systems.  The counter-trade proposal 
suggested Burmese agricultural and other products be traded 
for Iraqi \"fertilizers, bitumen, and sulfer\" (sic).  The two 
sides pledged to exchange \"scientific and technical 
information between specialized scientific research 
institutions in both countries in the fields of irrigation 
and water resources management.\"  The minutes end with an 
agreement to hold a second session of the Joint Committee in 
Rangoon in March 2003. 
 
4. (S) We note that the two dictatorships also agreed to 
draft a bilateral agreement \"concerning National News 
Agencies, TV Broadcasting organizations\" and to an \"exchange 
of training courses, on a reciprocal basis in the field of 
media and information.\" 
 
5.  (S) Comment:  The Burma-Iraq trade reported by other 
channels may be an outgrowth of the 2001 agreement and/or 
this March 2002 session of the Burma-Iraq Joint Committee. 
The agreed minutes of this meeting contain no individual 
elements that are particularly worrying in themselves.  The 
document clearly portrays the relationship between Iraq and 
Burma as cordial and cooperative, with a pledge \"to further 
enhance relations between the two countries in all fields.\"

SUBJECT: MORE INFORMATION ON BURMA\'S COUNTERNARCOTICS 
PROGRAM 
 
REF: A. RANGOON 1355 
     B. RANGOON 1415 
     C. RANGOON 1473 
 
1.  The GOB has recently released a bevy of information on 
its counternarcotics efforts, most of which we have reported 
in our previous cables (reftels).  However, in this cable we 
are providing some new information as follows: 
 
UN Protocol 
 
2.  The GOB has decided to accede to the 1972 Protocol to the 
UN\'s 1961 Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs.  Once signed, 
this will mean that Burma has become party to all of the UN\'s 
major narcotics conventions, including the 1961 Single 
Convention, the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic 
Substances, and the 1988 UN Drug Convention. 
 
Bilateral and Multilateral Agreements 
 
3.  Burma has signed bilateral narcotics control agreements 
with all of its near and some of its not so near neighbors. 
These include agreements with China, Thailand, India, 
Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos, the Phillipines, and Russia.  It 
is also a partner in UNDCP\'s six nation ACCORD plan of action 
in Southeast Asia and a member, with China, Thailand, and 
Laos, in the Mekong Sub-regional Cooperative Program against 
drugs. 
 
New Destiny Project 
 
4.  During the spring of 2002, the GOB collected 
approximately 290 metric tons of poppy seed in exchange for 
winter food crop seeds and other support.  According to the 
government, this is enough to seed approximately 40,000 
hectares of opium poppy, and is the basis of its prediction 
that it will cut the area under opium cultivation in Burma 
from approximately 80,000 hectares to 40,000 hectares during 
the current crop year. 
 
Seizures and Arrests 
 
5.  The latest figures for arrests and seizures indicate that 
the GOB has arrested 3,730 suspects in 2,529 drug-related 
cases from January 1, 2002 through November 15.  During that 
same time period, it seized 1,737 kilograms of opium, 300 
kilograms of heroin, 262 kilograms of marijuana, 9,191,000 
stimulant tablets, and 1,711 kilograms of ephedrine.  Most of 
these numbers are in line with previous years, though the 
seizures of stimulant tablets are well below last year\'s 
total of more than 32 million.

eradication program, illustrates what may happen more broadly 
in the Wa territories as the Wa push forward with their 
program.  Left to fend for itself with only minimal supplies, 
almost one-quarter of the village\'s population died within a 
period of less than 3 years.  Picked up by UNDCP as emergency 
case when it was on the verge of returning to opium farming, 
Song Keh is now slowly recovering from the trauma of the 
experience.  However, UNDCP does not have the resources or 
the mandate to deal with the thousands of villages and 
hundreds of thousands of villagers who will be affected by Wa 
efforts to fulfill their pledge to make their territories 
opium-free by 2005.  As matters stand now, many villagers 
will pay for that program with their lives -- a fact that has 
caught the attention of Aung San Suu Kyi, among others in 
Burma. End Summary. 
 
2.  Nothing illustrates the human cost of the Wa opium 
eradication programs so well as the fate of Song Keh, a Wa 
village that was forcibly relocated to the Nam Lwe valley (in 
northern Shan State, near the border with China) in 1999.  A 
village of about 480 mostly Christian Wa, Song Keh was 
originally located north of Pang Sang near Mong Maw in one of 
the thickest opium growing regions of the Wa territories. 
Relocated to Nam Lwe, the villagers were given essentially 
the same support given all resettled villagers by the United 
Wa State Party -- a stretch of wooded bottom land, 6 months 
of food, building materials for their houses, some basic 
medicines, and, in the case of Song Keh, 10 buffalo to help 
with the initial plowing. 
 
3. However, in Song Keh\'s case, as in the case of many 
relocated villages, the supplies proved sadly inadequate, 
leaving the village at the close of 2001 on the verge of 
collapse.  By October 2001, when Poloff first visited the 
village, the population had dwindled to only 373 as death had 
claimed almost ten percent of villagers each year since the 
time they were relocated.  Forty-two died in 1999, 36 in 
2000, and 30 in 2001, with most deaths coming from 
malnutrition, complicated by severe anemia, chest infections, 
and intestinal diseases.  Village food production amounted to 
only about 10 percent of the village\'s annual needs and, even 
supported by income from other jobs, villagers faced a food 
deficit equivalent to four to six months of annual 
consumption.  In short, they were condemned to starve.  The 
original buffalo had all been slaughtered, there was no clean 
water source or sanitation facilities for the village and, 
out of desperation, most had moved back into opium 
cultivation.  Virtually all of the village\'s 67 acres had 
been seeded in opium for the 2001/02 crop year in an effort 
to generate cash for food. 
 
4.  That decision, in turn, nearly proved to be the death 
knell for the village.  As it turned out, Song Keh\'s fields 
lay exactly in the middle of an area that the Wa and UNDCP\'s 
Wa Alternative Development Project had designated as an opium 
free area.  Consequently, when the village\'s crop blossomed, 
it was quickly felled by a joint Wa/UNDCP eradication program 
in February and March 2002. 
 
5.  Fortunately, UNDCP did not leave the matter there, but 
put together a program for the critically stricken village. 
This included deployment of a mobile health team, child 
immunization, the distribution of mosquito nets, and the 
construction of new water points and toilet and sanitation 
facilities.  Clothes and rice (about 19 tons) were handed out 
on an emergency basis.  Seeds for summer and winter crops 
were also distributed.  A school was built, classes started, 
and plans laid for the installation of three low-lift pumps 
for irrigation, as well as a new rice storage facility. 
 
6.  The entire program cost less than $20,000, but the 
effects were immediate.  By November 2002, when Poloff 
visited again, village deaths had dropped by two-thirds to 
only 11 in the year to date; 42 children are in school; all 
the village children have been vaccinated; and there is no 
opium.  All of the villages 67 acres have been seeded in food 
crops for the 2002/03 winter season. 
 
7. Song Keh is, of course, an extreme case.  It was only one 
of 13 villages that were relocated from areas north of Pang 
Sang to areas around Mong Hpen in 1999 and 2000 and, while 
there was suffering in all, none of the others ended up in 
the desperate straits that developed in Song Keh.  That said, 
Song Keh is as vivid example as one will ever find of what 
can happen when villages are forced out of opium production 
without sufficient economic support. 
 
8.  For the Wa territories, of course, this is critical. 
Over the next three years, the territories as a whole are to 
complete a transition to opium-free status, essentially as a 
result of Burmese and Chinese political pressure.  Several 
thousand villages with a population of between 300,000 and 
400,000 people will be affected.  As of now, however, only 
those resident in the Wa Alternative Development Project area 
(about 40,000 people) will receive any support at all (and 
that only to the end of 2003).   The rest will essentially be 
left to fend for themselves or to the mercies of the Wa\'s 
relocation program.  In either case, many will die. 
 
Comment 
 
9. Two points are worth stressing about this situation, 
First, the risks that the Wa are taking with their own 
population gives some sense of the pressure they are under 
from both the Burmese and the Chinese to get out of opium. 
While the Wa have never been cautious about spending lives 
for the sake of real strategic objective, the fact that they 
are willing to spend lives in this cause gives a sense of its 
importance to them. 
 
10.  Secondly, someone will pay for the elimination of opium 
in the Wa territories and Burma more generally.  It is not a 
cost-free exercise. As matters stand now, most of those costs 
will be borne by upland villagers who have few options other 
than opium production. (Aung San Suu Kyi made this exact 
point to the Chief of Mission and Poloff on December 2.)  The 
Wa authorities and the Government of Burma may kick in some 
support, but, as Song Keh\'s experience demonstrates, it is 
hardly likely to be enough.  The international community, 
which will benefit most from the elimination of opium here, 
could also help. However, as yet, there is no sign that the 
international community will act on a scale sufficient to 
prevent a tragedy, essentially because of sensitivities about 
work with the Wa in Burma.

SUBJECT: INITIAL MONEY LAUNDERING INVESTIGATIONS IN BURMA 
 
REF: RANGOON 908 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Burma has begun at least two investigations 
under its new money laundering law.  It has frozen assets 
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and applied to the 
courts for forfeiture of a variety of property connected with 
two high-profile narcotics cases.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Burma has moved with extraordinary speed to deal with 
problems of money laundering identified by the Financial 
Action Task Force.  On June 17, 2002, it enacted a powerful 
new law which criminalized money laundering in connection 
with virtually every kind of serious criminal activity.  A 
Central Control Board chaired by the Minister of Home Affairs 
was established in July and training for financial 
investigators was conducted in Rangoon and Mandalay in July 
and August.  Most importantly, the first investigations under 
the new law were begun within weeks of its passage.  Two 
cases, in particular, stand out.  The first involves the Gold 
Uni Investment Company; the second is directed at Tuan Sin 
Htan, one of the principals in the October 2000 Fiji drug 
bust. 
 
Gold Uni Investment Company 
 
3. (C) On July 12, police officials in Hong Kong discovered 
12.5 kilograms of heroin concealed within a shipment of raw 
jade stones from Burma.  They relayed information to Burma\'s 
Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), which 
immediately opened up an investigation.  Numerous arrests 
followed.  On July 19, Burma\'s new financial investigation 
unit was also tasked with pursuing leads in regard to bank 
accounts and currency transfers.  As a result of the work of 
the financial investigation unit, CCDAC has now filed under 
the new money laundering law for forfeiture of assets worth 
approximately Burmese Kyat 166 million (i.e., USD 166,000). 
The assets include four residential buildings, one poultry 
feed factory, five automobiles and one motorcycle, and five 
raw jade stones.  In addition, CCDAC has filed for a court 
order freezing all savings and checking accounts of suspects 
in the case, and is auditing eleven other accounts to 
determine if there is any further cause for action against 
other individuals. 
 
Tuan Sin Htan 
 
4. (C) On October 28, a multinational investigation team 
seized 357 kilograms of heroin in Suva, Fiji.  Shipping 
documents pointed to a Burma-based trading company, KMT 
Trading Enterprise.  CCDAC opened an investigation and, using 
powers granted under both its 1993 Narcotics Law and the new 
money laundering law, identified the following assets for 
forfeiture: 12 buildings, one golf course, one recreation 
center, two orange groves, two vehicles, three heavy 
construction vehicles, and one plot of undeveloped land.  It 
also froze all of the checking and savings accounts of the 
company and seized cash totaling approximately Burmese Kyat 
31 million (i.e., USD 31,000). 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C) The Burmese police have not hesitated to use the 
powers granted by the money laundering law.  What is 
surprising is that, at least to date, they have been careful 
to ensure that the law is applied only in clearly criminal 
cases.  This is important, because the powers in the law are 
truly extraordinarily.  Basically, it states that the 
government has the right to seize the funds or property of 
anyone who cannot \"clearly prove with valid evidence\" how he 
obtained the money or property in question.  Since almost no 
one can prove the source of funds in Burma, where 
record-keeping is a lost art, this means, in effect, that all 
funds on deposit in the banking system are potentially at 
risk and any indiscriminate investigations could provoke a 
panic.  Sensitive to this, police have focused on clearly 
criminal cases, at least to date.  Nevertheless they have 
produced some striking results and could produce more as they 
become more familiar with financial investigations.

SUBJECT: EX-STRONGMAN NE WIN DIES WHILE UNDER DETENTION 
 
 
Classified By: DCM: RON MCMULLEN FOR REASON 1.5(D) 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  Ne Win is dead.  The news has not yet hit 
the streets in Rangoon, but Ne Win\'s son told the DCM that 
reports of his father\'s death were true.  Ne Win\'s death is 
likely to have little political impact.  However, many in 
Burma will have trouble believing that \"the old man\" is 
finally gone.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Ne Win\'s son Ngwe Soe told DCM this afternoon that 
press reports that his father had died were true.  Following 
up on press reports that Ne Win died at 7:30 this morning, 
December 5, DCM attempted to visit the residence where Ne Win 
and his daughter Sanda Win have reportedly been under house 
arrest since March.  Authorities at the scene refused to 
comment on the reports but DCM encountered Ngwe Soe waiting 
by the police roadblock to the compound and apparently not 
allowed to enter.  Ngwe Soe acknowledged that his father was 
dead but asked that the DCM not convey this to reporters who 
were waiting nearby.  While we have no specific information 
on the cause of death, \"the old man,\" as he is known here in 
Rangoon, has suffered from heart disease for years.  In 2001, 
he reportedly received a pace-maker at a hospital in 
Singapore and he may have made at least one follow-up visit 
since that operation. 
 
2. (U)  Ne Win, who ruled Burma with an iron fist from the 
late 1950\'s until the late 1980\'s, has lived in virtual 
seclusion for most of the last 15 years.  Although he is 
blamed for single-handedly destroying what had been a vibrant 
Burmese economy with his personal brand of pseudo-socialist 
policies, and for brutally crushing any political dissent, he 
was also grudgingly admired for his charismatic personality. 
He swept people into his cause and then, just as quickly, 
imprisoned, tortured, and killed those he perceived to be a 
possible threat.  In the late 1980\'s when dire conditions 
from his economic policies created riots and protests, he 
retired from power and was succeeded by the State Law and 
Order Council (SLORC).  In 1997, the SLORC renamed itself the 
State Peace and Development Committee (SPDC) and remains in 
power today. 
 
3.  (U)  Ne Win was 91 years old and is survived by two 
wives, two daughters, two sons and two-step daughters from 
his four marriages.  One daughter, Sanda Win, jealously 
guarded access to the father over the years and attempted to 
promote his legacy through her own three sons.  Other family 
members, including ex-wives and other children, were 
reportedly allowed only infrequent \"audiences\" with Ne Win. 
 
4. (U)  Sanda\'s efforts to promote her sons as successors to 
the Ne Win throne came to an abrupt and unexpected halt 
earlier this year when the sons and their father were 
arrested on charges of high treason and economic 
improprieties.  While the sons were roundly despised in 
Rangoon for their violent excesses and flagrant disregard for 
the law, few here believe that they had the brains or 
inclination to plot a coup attempt.  Their arrests and 
subsequent sentences, and Sanda and Ne Win\'s house arrest, 
are generally believed to be an effort by SPDC Senior General 
Than Shwe, once a Ne Win underling, to wipe away any 
speculation that he was still under Ne Win\'s influence. 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C)  We expect most ordinary Burmese will react to Ne 
Win\'s passing with glee but, unfortunately, it is unlikely 
that his death will have any effect on the current regime\'s 
political or economic policies.  Senior General Than Shwe has 
made a pointed effort in recent years to distance the SPDC 
from Ne Win\'s legacy and put an end to rumors that Ne Win 
still wielded any power.  Furthermore, Than Shwe, like Ne Win 
before him, has asserted his personal control through purges 
of powerful ministers and military members.  Of the original 
19 SLORC members only three - Than Shwe, Maung Aye, and Khin 
Nyunt - remain, and Than Shwe\'s authority is clearly 
unchallenged.

SUBJECT: BURMA: BANKS AND CONSTRUCTION BOOMS, A BAD MIX 
 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The puzzling construction boom, continuing in 
Rangoon despite the dismal economy and an unclear demand, is 
being fueled by speculation by builders and investors. 
Unfortunately for the economy, private banks have not learned 
the lessons of Japan and are throwing caution to the wind in 
their financing of economically questionable construction 
projects.  With their loan portfolios already grim, many of 
these private banks could be wiped from the map if and when 
the Central Bank ever takes steps to bring credit under 
control.  End summary. 
 
Paving Paradise 
 
2. (SBU) Even in the midst of the country\'s economic crisis, 
the construction industry in Rangoon is still relatively 
active.  The newspapers regularly report on shining new 
office or apartment complexes, and bamboo scaffolding is 
evident on every block.  Part of the SPDC\'s drive to have a 
\"modern and developed\" city is to make prime land readily 
available for development.  These plots, owned either by the 
Office of the Prime Minister\'s Yangon City Development 
Council (YCDC) or the Department of Construction\'s Human 
Settlement and Housing Development department, are put out 
for bid.  Interested construction companies (or consortia) 
negotiate with the owner for the right to build.  The firms 
offer the respective government agency an equity share 
(usually 30-50 percent of the space) in exchange for a 
renewable 60-year lease.  The winning firm need not make any 
official payments to the government in exchange for the 
construction rights.  However, informal payments and close 
connections with key government officials, especially 
Secretary-1 General Khin Nyunt, are invaluable. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
3. (SBU) Many of the largest construction firms are part of 
keiretsu-style integrated holding companies that include a 
major private bank.  In addition, lending rates, set 
nationally by the Central Bank of Myanmar are about 15 
percent -- well below annual inflation rates.  Thus it is not 
surprising that construction firms rely largely on bank 
financing for their projects.  Financing is possible through 
the pre-sale of apartments and office space.  Banks assist in 
this as well by offering generous loans to potential 
renters/buyers. 
 
If You Build It, Will They Come? 
 
4. (SBU) Members of the country\'s largest construction 
industry association told us that business is good because 
demand for new housing and office space continues to be very 
high.  They asserted that rapid construction of new 
apartments is being pushed forward by Rangoon\'s population 
growth.  (Note: This seems unlikely as the vast majority of 
Rangoonites cannot afford the luxury apartments or offices 
constructed by these firms.)  The builders said that in 
addition, wealthy business people and high-ranking officers 
are buying many of the new apartments, condos, and offices as 
a hedge against a plummeting kyat. 
 
5. (SBU) There is no question that real estate is now viewed 
as the hedge of choice in an economy where anyone who can 
afford to keeps their kyat holdings low.  However, it seems 
unlikely that the minuscule upper class (even purchasing two 
or more units as pure investments) could support ongoing and 
planned construction.  An independent economist following the 
construction sector said that construction firms are also 
speculating, taking out cheap kyat loans and putting the 
money into something more solid, even without reliable demand 
projections.  Also, he noted, these construction firms were 
taking their time in building, trying to whip up demand for 
their \"exclusive\" properties along the way. 
 
Banks Rolling the Dice 
 
6. (SBU) As long as the government is eager to develop prime 
downtown locations, construction firms can get unlimited 
cheap loans, the kyat continues its decline, and the Rangoon 
glitterati view real estate as a solid investment, the 
construction bubble should continue to inflate despite the 
economy\'s problems.  However, the participation in this boom 
of many of the nation\'s private banks could be edging them 
toward a Japan-style banking crisis.  All the signs are 
there: an industry building excessively expecting the market 
to remain high, unfettered bank lending to companies based on 
personal connections rather than objective analysis of future 
income potential, and collateral in real assets priced at 
their inflated value.  The private banks here already suffer 
from poor management, high reserve requirements, irrational 
government-set lending and deposit rates, and high 
non-performing loan portfolios.  A fall in real estate 
prices, or a credit crunch imposed by the Central Bank, could 
quickly ruin these banks by dumping on them an immense 
additional burden of bad debt. 
 
7. (C) Comment: The question, then, is not whether the 
private banks that binged on real estate will collapse, but 
what the impact of their collapse will be.  The immediate 
impact on society will not be great.  Certainly the 
construction industry and a few other sectors dominated by 
private firms will suffer from a reduction in their 
free-flowing capital.  However, the formal private banking 
sector in Burma is still small relative to the entire 
economy.  Most individuals and most businesses will get by, 
as they do now, without significant bank loans or deposits. 
Few would suffer if some private banks went bad.  Longer 
term, though, the effects would be more pronounced, 
particularly if the Central Bank bails out failed banks by 
essentially printing money.  The net result then could be a 
de facto mass nationalization of the banks and another huge 
setback for hopes of financial and economic reform.  End 
comment.

1.  (U)  The regime confirmed ex-dictator Ne Win\'s death with 
a brief obituary from the family buried on the second to the 
last page of today\'s State-controlled newspapers.  Tucked 
between the weather forecast and television schedule, the 
obituary was a brief statement that Ne Win died at 7:30 in 
the morning on December 5th and, based on his wishes, was 
cremated at a private cemetery in Rangoon at 1:30 that 
afternoon. 
 
2.  (U)  There is no indication that the SPDC is planning any 
state ceremonies or official recognition of Ne Win\'s death, 
despite the fact that he ruled the country for almost three 
decades.  The MOFA Americas\' Division Director told Poloff he 
was not aware of any government plans to honor Ne Win, saying 
he only knew what he had read in the obituary.  With the 
general public\'s attitude toward the death ranging from 
relief to satisfaction, the regime may be assessing the 
appropriate official response.  The Buddhist custom is for 
friends, neighbors and the public to visit the home of the 
deceased on the seventh day after the death to offer 
condolences to the family and donations to the monks who have 
prayed to help his soul into another life.  This gives the 
regime some time to decide what, if anything, it will do to 
recognize Ne Win\'s demise. 
 
3.  (U)  Word of Ne Win\'s death did not spread as quickly as 
expected through the streets.  By late evening on December 5, 
a sampling of the general public indicated that few had heard 
that he was dead.  When they heard the news, the most common 
response was \"finally.\"

1. (C) Summary: UN Special Envoy for Burma Razali Ismail, 
during his November visit to Rangoon, paid a call on the 
SPDC\'s Minister for National Planning and Economic 
Development, and focal point for SPDC-UN relations, U Soe 
Tha.  As he did during Razali\'s previous visit in August, the 
Minister played Razali the same unbelievable tune: touting 
the country\'s economic progress, explaining the necessity of 
GOB \"involvement\" in UNDP programs, and justifying limiting 
Aung San Suu Kyi\'s access to UN project sites.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Post has recently obtained an official GOB readout of 
the meeting between the SPDC\'s economic planning czar U Soe 
Tha (the GOB focal point for UNDP and UNICEF projects in 
Burma) and Razali when he visited Rangoon in mid-November. 
During the brief meeting, Razali asked U Soe Tha about the 
sagging Burmese economy and for a progress report on the 
projects proposed by the UNDP for the fourth iteration of its 
Human Development Initiative (HDI-IV). 
 
3. (C) On the economy, U Soe Tha repeated almost verbatim his 
message from August, citing purported year-on-year double 
digit GDP growth rates thus far in FY 2002-03, an increase in 
exports resulting in a trade surplus, and an \"improving\" 
budgetary situation.  He did admit that inflation was 
\"slightly high,\" but said that \"necessary measures\" were 
being taken to reduce the inflation rate. 
 
4. (C) On the UNDP\'s HDI-IV projects, U Soe Tha told Razali 
that 6 of 7 proposed projects would likely get underway 
sometime this month.  However, it is unclear whether these 
projects have actually been approved by the cabinet, or just 
by \"concerned ministries.\"  We also understand that the 
UNDP\'s planned agricultural sector review has gotten the nod. 
 On a less encouraging note, the Minister repeated his August 
warning to Razali that \"the GOB will be more involved in the 
HDI-IV than it was in the HDI-III.\"  Once again, though, the 
Minister did not flesh out the details of this planned 
\"involvement.\" 
 
5. (C) As he did in August, Razali expressed his concern that 
ASSK be allowed to visit and study HDI-IV program sites.  U 
Soe Tha was unmoved, though, repeating his earlier reply that 
government approval was necessary if any \"outsider\" wished to 
study projects sites that were \"the responsibility of 
government organizations.\" 
 
6. (C) Comment: Razali did not push U Soe Tha on the economy 
as much as in August, leading us to think that the Envoy is 
realizing that debating the finer points of economic reform 
with the witless Minster is a fool\'s errand.  The regime is 
claiming that it is removing obstacles to the UNDP\'s HDI-IV 
programs.  However, UNDP tells us that progress on this front 
has in fact been quite limited.  Likewise, the repeated, but 
vague, threat of increased government attention to UNDP 
projects and the apparent continued official reluctance to 
allow ASSK access to aid project sites are of concern.  End 
comment.

that only 75 of these 115 political prisoners have been 
released.  NLD Secretary U Lwin told Poloff that he could 
account for only 50 NLD members and one student from another 
political party that had been released, and \"maybe about 20 
other releases.\"  The NLD Political Prisoners Support 
Committee (PPSC), which offers legal and financial support to 
families of all political prisoners, can account for only 75 
releases from the 115.  The PPSC said it has verified this 
information with the International Committee for the Red 
Cross. 
 
2.  (C)  Several of the political prisoners released after 
the November 19 announcement told Poloff that they were 
required to sign an agreement accepting the conditions of 
Section 401 of the penal code.  Under this section, the 
prisoners are subject to serving the remainder of their 
current sentences if they are rearrested for any reason.  The 
prisoners reported that some of their fellow prisoners 
refused to sign the 401 agreement and that this may have been 
the reason they were not released.  U Lwin opined that 
political prisoners who are close to the end of their 
sentences are more willing to sign the agreement than those 
who have several years to go.  Those with long sentences do 
not want the fear of an automatic long sentence hanging over 
them, he said.  Others choose not to sign on principle. 
There were some political prisoners released just after talks 
with Aung San Suu Kyi began who were not required to sign the 
Section 401 agreement, but apparently all are now required to 
sign.

Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Ethnic Kachin cease-fire groups have 
benefited significantly from semi-autonomous economic control 
of their areas of influence.  The commercial arms of these 
armies turned political groups are involved in everything 
from jade and gold mining to sugar milling and liquor 
production.  Unfortunately, to date little of this economic 
windfall has trickled down to the poor residents of the 
cease-fire groups\' remote areas of control.  However, with 
some political changes afoot, this imbalance may start to 
change.  End summary. 
 
Background 
 
2. (SBU) Two Embassy staff recently visited Myitkyina, the 
capital of Kachin State.  Kachin State is located in the far 
north of Burma, bordered on the east by China and on the 
northwest by India.  For more than 40 years, the state was 
caught up in the turmoil of civil war, with a cease-fire 
agreement between the government and the predominate Kachin 
Independence Army (KIA) signed only in 1994.  On the economic 
side, Kachin State is mountainous and very rich in natural 
resources, containing the world\'s only pure jadeite mines as 
well as gold, timber, and other mining.  Despite these 
riches, the people remain very poor and the economy quite 
undeveloped.  The riches gained from the jade and gold mines 
do not trickle down very far, and according to one Kachin 
leader in Rangoon, the SPDC has put little or no development 
funding into the state since 1994 (though it has granted NGOs 
access to the area).  Increasing Chinese economic influence 
in the state has further intensified local people\'s concerns 
that their state\'s wealth is being exported. 
 
3. (SBU) Since the cease-fire, the armed groups have begun to 
focus on political and economic matters within their zones of 
control.  The Kachin Independence Organization (KIO; the 
political wing of the KIA), and, to a lesser extent, the New 
Democratic Army - Kachin State (NDA-K), both have corporate 
arms which occupy themselves primarily with earning revenue 
from natural resource extraction and some customs collection. 
 The KIO, through its commercial arm, Bu Ga Co., Ltd, has the 
widest economic interests including a sugar mill and a rum 
distillery. 
 
A Smorgasbord of Natural Resources... 
 
4. (C) According to Bu Ga, and other Kachin business leaders, 
under the terms of the 1994 cease-fire agreement, the KIO and 
NDA-K have some autonomy in the development of the natural 
resources within their \"territories.\"  If the SPDC wants to 
offer for bid areas for timbering or mining within the KIO 
zone, there has to be an agreement struck between the SPDC, 
the KIO, and the investor.  The details are unclear of how 
these agreements are structured.  The lack of such an 
agreement can lead to violence.  We heard one tale of a KIA 
attack several years ago on a Chinese firm that signed an 
agreement with the SPDC to mine coal in a KIA-controlled area 
without consultation with the Kachin group. 
 
5. (SBU) For plots not put up for bid by the SPDC, the KIO 
says it is free to negotiate directly with private firms. 
Non-KIO Kachin jade miners and businessmen told us that 
dealing with the KIO is often easier than negotiating with 
the SPDC because the smaller bureaucracy means fewer bribes. 
The sections of the Irrawaddy River that run through KIO 
territory can be dredged for gold without government 
approval.  For portions of the river within SPDC-controlled 
territory, mining is only possible in a joint venture with 
the corporate front of the Burmese army\'s powerful Northern 
Command. 
 
6. (C) However, according to Kachin sources, neither the 
local Kachin-owned jade mining firms, nor Bu Ga, have the 
capital to invest in the heavy machinery needed for serious 
mining.  For that equipment, local firms grudgingly link up 
with the military\'s Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd, 
with overseas Chinese who are prevented by Burmese law from 
directly investing in jade mining, or with companies tied to 
Wa, Kokang, and Pa-O ethnic cease-fire groups in Shan State. 
 
7. (C) There are conflicting tales on logging.  In theory, 
the KIO political leadership asserts, there is a KIO ban on 
logging in its cease-fire zone.  Only under very special 
circumstances, and with the agreement of the government, can 
some logging be undertaken.  An example of such an exception 
is some teak logging that was permitted by the KIO and SPDC 
in order to clear land for expansion of the Myitkyina-Bhamo 
road.  In reality, Bu Ga is still involved in the logging 
industry, both buying whole logs from the government for 
processing and export, and cutting trees illegally for sale 
over the Chinese border.  Bu Ga told us the logging in the 
KIO regions is constrained more by the depletion of good 
trees than by political mandates. 
 
...And A Few Non-Traditional Ventures 
 
8. (SBU) Through a quirk of the cease-fire accord, the KIA 
(through Bu Ga) was forced by the SPDC to take over a 
decrepit and money-losing sugar mill near Myitkyina.  The 
mill, circa 1956, suffers from a lack of raw materials (most 
local farmers would rather pan for gold than grow sugar 
cane), chronic spare part shortages (due to government import 
controls), and poor quality control.  One way Bu Ga is trying 
to make up for these shortcomings is by turning the sugar 
cane into rum for sale locally. 
 
9. (SBU) Another good source of income for the KIA is customs 
revenue.  The KIA, which controls most of the Burma-China 
border in Kachin State, maintains good relations with local 
Chinese frontier officials.  The KIO seems to have the 
primary right to collect customs on trade that comes through 
the controlled border areas. 
 
Regional Development Misses the Gravy Train 
 
10. (SBU) It is difficult to get a clear picture of whether 
the KIA\'s economic benefits are being transmitted in a 
meaningful way to the grassroots level.  We did not travel to 
the KIA zone, but NGOs in Myitkyina told us that the areas 
around the Chinese border are the poorest and least developed 
in the State.  Likewise, KIO leaders were not able to point 
to any concerted effort to turn a portion of the revenue 
earned by the KIA and its commercial arm into community and 
economic development.  The one exception is the Kachin 
Baptist Convention, a group closely affiliated with the KIO, 
which has been working independently and with other community 
and religious groups on health education and community 
development projects in some remote villages. 
 
11. (C) Comment:  Despite significant economic benefits that 
have come the way of the cease-fire groups and their 
affiliated businesses, until now, regional economic 
development has not been a priority of the Kachin ethnic 
leadership.  However, there is some optimism that this may 
change.  The KIO is under new, younger leadership (as of 
January 2002), which has dedicated itself to more \"openness\" 
and a better \"connection with the masses.\"  KIO leaders also 
told us they would like to attract more tourism and foreign 
investment in infrastructure in its area.  Likewise, the KIO, 
the NDA-K, and the smaller Kachin Democratic Army (operating 
in northern Shan State) have apparently unified politically 
under the Kachin National Consultative Assembly (KNCA).  The 
KNCA is asserting that two of its primary goals are economic 
development and improved education for all Kachin people. 
End comment.

DEMOCRACY\'S AMBRAMOWITZ 
 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  Following meetings with several SPDC 
officials, former Ambassador Morton Ambramowitz met at the 
EMR with NLD Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi on December 5th.  The 
COM and the PAO were also present.  In a discussion that 
lasted nearly two hours, Ambramowitz checked his impressions 
and the assertions of the SPDC officials with ASSK.  He asked 
for ASSK\'s reading of the gravity of the situation facing the 
country and the prospects for change, and her views on how 
best to provide humanitarian assistance.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U)  The former ambassador, now a Director of the National 
Endowment for Democracy, had met earlier with the Home, 
Labor, and Education Ministers, as well as with Kyaw Thein 
and Hla Min.  A meeting with S1 General Khin Nyunt was 
cancelled at the last minute.  Ambramowitz reported that a 
theme he had not heard in his last visit in 1997, the 
\"integration of the ethnic nationalities,\" permeated all his 
discussions with SPDC officials.  Most officials averred that 
there was no economic crisis, and the SPDC was moving at its 
own pace toward transition, because the integration of the 
nationalities was not secure enough to move precipitously to 
a new arrangement. 
 
3. (C)  ASSK replied that in her recent visit to Shan State 
she found \"strong solidarity between the ethnicities and us\" 
and greater support than the NLD enjoyed twelve years ago. 
She said she was encouraged that the Shans had evidently laid 
aside ethnic considerations and had recognized that the most 
important need was for political change.  Even in the go-go 
border town of Tachileik, she found \"amazing support,\" 
signifying that the merchants dependent on the border trade 
had realized that there could be no economic development 
without political change.  She indicated that she would 
complete a round of visits to each of the States during this 
dry season. 
 
4. (C)  Ambramowitz asked whether a \"humanitarian crisis\" 
exists and, if so, should more assistance be given, even if 
through the Burmese Government?  ASSK agreed there were very 
serious problems, such as HIV/AIDS, the quality of education, 
and the health care system.  While she said she didn\'t 
believe the system was on the verge of collapse, something 
very small could spark \"unforeseen circumstances.\"  She said 
that assistance programs should be expanded, but not through 
the SPDC.  Although she allowed there have to be dealings 
with the government, there should be \"no compromise\" on the 
basic requirements for accountability, transparency, 
independent monitoring, and providing no benefit to the SPDC. 
 She offered the Network Project (a UNICEF early childhood 
development program) as an example of a program that worked 
without helping the SPDC and promoted pluralism at the same 
time.  She expressed dismay that USG assistance for this 
project may not be continued. 
 
5. (C)  She complained that the SPDC was able to \"pressurize\" 
the UN agencies against cooperating with her, and asked, if 
UN agencies cave in to pressure on this front \"how can we 
trust them\" on other matters.  She pointed out it must be 
questioned whether humanitarian assistance would help the 
Burmese people provide for themselves in the future.  \"Are 
they going to survive just to die another day?  Or are they 
going to survive to change the system?\" 
 
6. (C)  Ambramowitz said he was leaving Burma with the 
impression that the current regime would make very little 
effort to deal with her or to move toward civilian 
government, and asked whether the only way to effect change 
under these circumstances would be to encourage a split in 
the military.  ASSK agreed he was \"basically right\" and that 
it was probably Sr. General Than Shwe who opposed change. 
She opined that he could not be as firmly in control as is 
supposed because he is \"too lazy to do his homework\" and lets 
people around him do all the work.  She said the 
international community must keep up the pressure, continue 
to point out that change is inevitable and at the same time, 
make clear to those in the military that favor political 
change that reasonable elements are appreciated, and give 
them more confidence. 
 
7. (C)  As the discussion wound down, ASSK said it was 
necessary to continue to \"work on practical terms\" and \"build 
up the strength of the people -- but that\'s our (e.g. the 
party\'s) job and . . . we\'re not doing badly.\"  She said 
although she cannot say the NLD as an organization is getting 
stronger -- citing the stumbling blocks to opening branch 
offices including harassment by local PDC\'s and USDA\'s -- 
support for the party is getting much stronger.

SUBJECT: KACHIN JADE MINING: THE ROAD TO RICHES AND RUIN 
 
REF: RANGOON 1571 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Jade mining and smuggling are big business 
in Kachin State.  Concession sales provide revenue for both 
the government and the Kachin ethnic cease-fire groups. 
However, little trickles down to the average citizen.  End 
summary. 
 
Jade Mining Ain\'t What it Used to Be 
 
2. (SBU) Kachin State has the world\'s only pure jadeite 
mines.  However, according to Kachin jade miners and various 
community leaders, the jade industry is not what it used to 
be.  In the past, the jade mines (focused on the town of Hpa 
Kant, northwest of Myitkyina) were the employer of last 
resort for local people.  If all else failed, it was always 
possible for an individual to try his luck at jade mining. 
Now, the jade mines have been re-organized by the government 
to cater to larger mining companies that rely more on heavy 
machinery than manpower.  While this has cleaned up the wild 
west image of Hpa Kant, the economic outlet and opportunities 
for local people have also declined significantly. 
 
3. (SBU) Most Kachin mining executives started as small time 
prospectors, making their money as independent miners and 
traders.  Now they have companies that, while capital-poor, 
are able to offer experience and knowledge of the local 
mining conditions.  Engineers and geologists are shunned in 
the Kachin jade fields, while a nose for the rock is rewarded 
handsomely.  The capital, and heavy equipment, necessary for 
today\'s mining industry comes from three primary sources: (1) 
Chinese investors from the PRC operating at arms length or 
with illegally acquired Burmese ID papers; (2) the Burmese 
military\'s Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd.; or, (3) 
businesses from the Wa, Kokang, or Pa-O cease-fire groups who 
have the cash to buy the heavy equipment, but not the 
expertise to mine effectively. 
 
4. (SBU) On the surface, the SPDC\'s Ministry of Mines 
operates a rational bidding system.  Periodically, the 
government auctions off surprisingly short 3-year leases on a 
number of plots (of varying size) for prospecting and 
development.  Bidders must put down a 100,000 kyat (about 
$100) deposit for each bid, which is returned if the bid is 
not successful.  The government establishes a minimum bid for 
each plot (usually 1 million kyat ($1,000), but can be up to 
55 million kyat ($55,000) for the best areas).  The bidding 
process is far from transparent, as bidders are not allowed 
to be present when the Ministry of Mines unseals the bids. 
Not surprisingly, those with the best connections usually get 
the best plots.  The Kachin miners say that partnering with 
UMEHL ensures the best results during the bidding process, 
but that the company is an unreliable partner that takes far 
more than its share of the profits. 
 
5. (SBU) In areas of the state that are under the 
semi-autonomous control of the ethnic Kachin cease-fire 
groups, the process is a bit different.  For plots not 
specifically put up for bid by the SPDC, Kachin Independence 
Organization (KIO) business representatives told us that they 
are free to negotiate directly with private firms.  Non-KIO 
Kachin jade miners and businessmen told us that dealing with 
the KIO is often easier than negotiating with the SPDC 
because the smaller bureaucracy means fewer bribes. 
 
Taking the Backdoor 
 
6. (SBU) There are two ways to get high-quality jade stones 
onto the market.  The first, and more popular, route is to 
hire couriers to illegally bring stones over the border 
directly, or via Mandalay, to buyers in China or Thailand. 
This bypasses the government\'s ostensibly rigid controls on 
the sale of gems, and also the government\'s taxation system. 
The second, legal, route is to pay an up front 20 percent tax 
to the Ministry of Mines, bring the stones to Rangoon for 
sale at the semi-annual gem emporium, and then pay taxes on 
the profits (as well as various bribes along the way). 
According to the miners, the only benefit of the second 
route, besides its legality, is that foreign exchange profits 
from these sales are \"white\" and thus can be used for 
importing, etc. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  The restructuring of the jade mining 
industry has brought about some positive short term 
reductions in drugs and prostitution in mining towns. 
However, these short term localized benefits are overshadowed 
by increasingly serious economic and social ills across the 
state.  Though NGOs can and do make a difference, until the 
government and KIO focus on turning mining profits into 
economic development, and creating economic alternatives for 
local people, the humanitarian problems in Kachin State will 
continue to expand.  End comment.

SUBJECT: USDA TO IMPLEMENT SENIOR GENERAL,S PLAN 
 
 
1.  Summary: The Union Solidarity Development Association 
(USDA) finally held its annual general meeting on November 
15, about two months after it was initially expected. 
Apparently Senior General Than Shwe had to overcome 
resistence by some members before the event could be staged. 
The strong rhetoric of the meeting gave every indication that 
the Senior General is still determined that the organization 
will play a central role in the country\'s future. End Summary. 
 
2.  At its ninth annual general meeting the USDA declared 
itself resolute to stand as a \"consolidated national force\" 
and to shift from a \"quantitative\" to a \"qualitative\" power 
by selecting the \"cream\" from among its members to serve as 
leaders \"in order to exist as long as the world does.\"  The 
USDA general meeting is usually held on September 15, the 
anniversary of the organization,s founding in 1993.  This 
year the general meeting was postponed, reportedly due to 
resistance from leaders who no longer wanted to participate. 
 
3.  According to local sources, members from 30 government 
offices resisted becoming \"full-time\" USDA officials on the 
grounds that they would lose their monthly government 
salaries.  (USDA is composed of a 
\"voluntary\" workforce).  After two months of discussions, the 
Patron of the USDA, SPDC Senior General Than Shwe, apparently 
overcame resistance by the newly \"full-time\" and unsalaried 
officials and held a four-day annual general meeting 
beginning on November 15. 
 
4.  Once the meeting went forward, key SPDC officers and 
members fell in line and showed their support for the USDA 
(and Than Shwe) by discussing development tasks for each of 
the seven sectors based on the state\'s \"five-year plan.\" 
They also selected the most qualified of the 520 USDA 
delegates in attendance, \"the cream,\" to lead groups 
addressing these development tasks.  The seven groups 
addressed the following tasks: economics, administration, 
organization, social, culture, education, and union 
development. 
 
5.  Key SPDC officials who attended the meeting were Senior 
General Than Shwe, USDA Central Executive Committee members 
(composed of ten SPDC ministers), representatives of the 
National Convention Convening Commission, the Office of the 
President, the Attorney General, the Chief Justice, the 
Auditor General, and Chairman of the Civil Service Selection 
Training Board.  The 520 delegates were USDA representatives 
of states, divisions, districts, and townships led by USDA 
General Secretary U Than Aung.  The meeting was somewhat 
similar in composition to a parliamentary convention, except 
there were no elected officials. 
 
6. The USDA meeting concluded with its members pledging their 
support for twelve objectives, three causes, and any 
\"instructions\" from Senior General Than Shwe.  A contingent 
of USDA members from high school sang the song \"eternal 
union.\" 
 
7.  Comment:  The annual meeting appears to have affirmed 
that Senior General Than Shwe is continuing to move forward 
with the SPDC\'s plan for managing the country,s affairs. 
The strong rhetoric of the meeting gives every indication 
that the Senior General is determined that the USDA play a 
central role in the country,s future.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S ECONOMIC PROSPECTS: HOW LOW CAN THEY GO? 
 
REF: A. RANGON 1468 
 
     B. RANGOON 1248 
 
1. (U) The full text of the Burma Country Commercial Guide is 
available on the internet or via email from 
wohlauerbv@state.gov.  The following is a summary. 
 
2. (U) The U.S. Government has an official policy to neither 
encourage nor discourage trade with Burma.  Since May 1997, 
the U.S. Government has prohibited new investment by U.S. 
persons or entities.  A number of U.S. companies exited the 
Burma market even prior to the imposition of these sanctions, 
however, due to the increasingly poor business climate, and 
mounting criticism in the United States from human rights 
groups, consumers, and some shareholders because of the 
Burmese government\'s serious human rights abuses and lack of 
progress toward democracy.  No new sanctions were applied 
during FY 2001-02, although President Bush has continued the 
national emergency in place regarding the situation in Burma. 
 The U.S. Congress has been deliberating a bill that would 
impose additional sanctions on the import of Burmese textiles. 
 
3. (U) Burma\'s economy remains over 60 percent dependent on 
agriculture and extraction of natural resources.  The 
manufacturing sector makes up only 8 percent of GDP.  Burma\'s 
principal exports are natural gas, garments, beans and 
pulses, teak, and prawns and seafood.  Burma is also one of 
the world\'s leading producers of opiates.  U.S.-Burma trade 
is heavily skewed in favor of Burma.  Burmese garment exports 
to the United States, which more than doubled in 2000 to $415 
million, fell slightly in 2001 and are headed for a sharper 
decline in 2002.  U.S. exports to Burma, mostly machinery, 
totaled only $11.3 million in 2001 and are also off in 2002. 
 
4. (SBU) Most of the population is located in rural areas and 
survives at subsistence levels.  Nearly half the children 
suffers from malnutrition, and many children never enter 
primary school.  Drug use and HIV/AIDS are problems that are 
growing unchecked.  UN agencies and several international 
NGOs are in Burma, but their effectiveness is limited by lack 
of government cooperation and the restrictions many countries 
have on the provision of humanitarian assistance to Burma. 
The country\'s infrastructure, including the telephone 
network, is in a terrible state of disrepair.  Likewise, the 
educational infrastructure is in ruins as the government has 
kept universities closed for much of the past fifteen years. 
As a result, human resources have been severely damaged, with 
potentially serious long-term consequences. 
 
5. (SBU) Economic information is very difficult to obtain, as 
the government does not publish reliable data -- or in some 
cases, any data.  The economy suffers from serious economic 
distortions, including an official exchange rate that 
overvalues the Burmese kyat about 200 times.  Expansionary 
monetary policies and state deficit spending have contributed 
to inflation, which rose to over 60 percent for FY 2001-02. 
Foreign exchange is likewise in very short supply, with an 
average of only two or two and one half months of import 
cover throughout FY 2001-02.  The government has responded to 
this foreign exchange shortage by squeezing importers. 
 
6. (SBU) As reported in reftels, we see no sign that the 
government is moving toward improving its investment climate 
or reforming its economic policies.  In the year ahead, this 
ongoing mismanagement will only intensify the impact of 
forthcoming economic blows due to low levels of new foreign 
investment, and probable declines in key exports.  As usual 
the people, some of whom are already relying on government 
rice rations for survival, will bear the brunt of this 
further economic disintegration.

1. (C) Summary: Embassy Rangoon wants to provide 
clarification and counterpoint to reftels reporting on Burma 
counterterrorism and counternarcotics issues. When discussing 
drugs and thugs, accurate information is absolutely crucial 
to framing USG counternarcotics stategy in the context of 
Burma-Thai relations.  Reftels draw some unwarranted 
conclusions that distort the discussion of narcotics and 
terrorism issues in Burma and Thailand. Post also encourages 
more support for Burmese/Thai cooperation on the 
methamphetamine problem as, in contrast to opium (which is 
being attacked effectively at its source in Burma), it is a 
regional problem which must be dealt with through regional 
strategies. The Thaksin government appears to understand this 
but, to judge from recent reports, that understanding is not 
yet wide-spread within the ranks of Thai officials.  End 
Summary. 
 
Terrorism 
 
2. (C) Reftel A concludes that the evidence suggests the SPDC 
is bombing Burmese embassies as part of a \"dirty tricks\" 
campaign against pro-democracy groups in Thailand. There is 
no doubt that defaming these groups is a priority for the 
SPDC. However, more facts, and an examination of the motives 
of all parties involved, are needed before basing such a 
conclusion solely on information provided by an FTUB (Free 
Trade Union of Burma) contact with \"allies\" at the Thai NSC. 
Right now, saying the letter bombs are just \"dirty tricks\" is 
unwarranted. 
 
3.  (C) Two points in particular stand out.  First, aside 
from initial press mention of the  receipt of the letter 
bombs, the GOB has not heavily publicized the mail bombing 
campaign against their embassies. If the SPDC was trying to 
blame the FTUB or any other Thai based pro-democracy groups, 
one can bet they would be mounting one of their heavy-handed 
media blitzes and accusing those groups of terrorist acts. 
Secondly, the reason the GOB has not turned the bombs over to 
the Thais is because, according to our sources, the bombs 
were either destroyed (in some cases), or turned over to the 
host-country authorities where the targeted Burmese embassies 
are located. These embassy letter bombings are now under 
investigation by Burmese and, according to Ref A, Thai 
authorities. Once that investigation is complete the guilty 
parties  can be named. Right now the word of the FTUB should 
not be considered the final word on the letter bomb incidents. 
 
Counternarcotics 
 
4. (C) Comments by high ranking RTA officials that the 
Burmese army is flooding Thailand with a billion tablets of 
methamphetamines have morphed from allegations to \"fact\". 
Although the \"billion tablet\" allegations were subsequently 
denied in the press by RTA spokesmen, that number has become 
imbedded in the Burma-Thai counternarcotics discussion  and 
it distorts any clear picture of Burmese counternarcotics 
efforts as well as Thai interdiction programs. In Ref B, 
Bangkok reports discussing the RTA statement with senior Thai 
ONCB officials who are quoted as telling Bangkok NAS that 
\"any estimates of next year\'s amphetamine production were 
obviously based on speculation and varied widely\" (the RTA 
officials\' predictions of one billion methamphetamine pills 
into Thailand this year is also incompatible with available 
data from DEA and ONCB). According to Reftel C, seizures in 
Thailand\'s northern provinces totaled  about 22 million pills 
 - a number that suggests either unusually inept Thai 
interdiction efforts or that the flow of methamphetamines is 
well below a billion tablets. 
 
5. (C)  Comment: When discussing drugs and thugs, accurate 
information is always absolutely crucial to framing USG 
counternarcotics and counterterrorism strategy - so should it 
be in discussing these issues in the regional context of 
Burma and Thailand. Post offers our views as counterpoint and 
clarification to reftels and makes this observation: in 
contrast to opium, which is being attacked effectively at its 
source in Burma, methamphetamine production and trafficking 
are regional problems and they must be treated through 
regional strategies and cooperation. The same applies to 
counterterrorism efforts. The Thaksin government appears to 
understand this but, to judge from recent reports, that 
understanding is not yet wide-spread within the ranks of Thai 
officials.  End Comment.

I. Summary 
 
While Burma is the world\'s second largest producer of illicit 
opium, its overall production in 2002 was actually only a 
fraction of its production in the mid-1990s.  According to 
the joint U.S./Burma opium yield survey, opium production in 
Burma totaled no more than 630 metric tons in 2001, down more 
than 26 percent from a year earlier, and less than 
one-quarter of the 2,560 metric tons produced in Burma in 
1996. 
 
Over the past several years, the Burmese government has 
significantly extended its counternarcotics cooperation with 
other states.  In 2001, it signed counternarcotics MOUs with 
both China and Thailand, and, in both 2001 and 2002, joined 
with China in joint operations in northern and eastern Shan 
State which resulted in the destruction of several major drug 
trafficking rings, including one group which the Chinese 
called one of the largest \"armed drug smuggling groups in the 
Golden Triangle area.\"  Cooperation with Thailand was 
interrupted by tensions on the border during the summer of 
2002, but has been revived as tensions have eased. 
 
In 2002, Burma also responded to rising international 
concerns regarding the quality of its anti-money laundering 
regime by enacting a powerful new money-laundering law that 
criminalizes money laundering in connection with virtually 
every type of major criminal activity.  The first 
investigations under this law began in July, resulting in the 
seizure of several hundred thousand dollars in assets. 
 
Burma is a party to the 1961 UN Single Convention, the 1971 
UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention.  It has also announced that it will shortly 
adhere to the 1972 Protocol to the 1961 Single Convention. 
 
II. Status of Country 
 
Burma is the world\'s second largest producer of illicit 
opium.  However, its overall production in 2001 was actually 
only a fraction of its production in the mid-1990s. 
According to the joint U.S./Burma opium yield survey, opium 
production in Burma totaled no more than 630 metric tons in 
2002, down 26 percent from a year earlier, and less than 
one-quarter of the 2,560 metric tons produced in Burma in 
1996. Approximately half of this decline reflects a decline 
in acreage under cultivation (which dropped by more than half 
to only 78,000 hectares in 2002).  The remainder was due to 
lower yields (now only about 8 kilograms/hectare) throughout 
Burma. 
 
Burma also plays a role in the regional traffic in 
amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  Drug gangs based in the 
Burma/China and Burma/Thailand border areas annually produce 
several hundred million methamphetamine tablets for markets 
in Thailand, China, and other Southeast Asian states on the 
basis of precursors imported from neighboring states.  Burma 
itself does not have a chemical industry and does not produce 
any of the precursors for methamphetamine or other artificial 
drugs.  Neither is there any significant market in Burma for 
ATS. 
 
Burma has a small, but growing drug abuse problem.  While the 
government maintains that there are only about 70,000 
registered addicts in Burma, surveys conducted by UNDCP, 
among others, suggest that the addict population could be as 
high as 300,000 (i.e., still less than 1 percent of the 
population), with opium the major source of addiction.  There 
is also a growing HIV/AIDS epidemic, linked in part to 
intravenous drug use.  According to surveys, 57 percent of 
all intravenous drug users in Burma have tested positive for 
the HIV/AIDS virus. 
 
Money-laundering is also an area of concern.  While 
international money flows through Burma are small, given the 
undeveloped state of its banking system and tight government 
controls on all funds transfers, the Financial Action Task 
Force in June 2001 placed Burma on its list of 
non-cooperating territories, because of concerns regarding 
weaknesses in Burma\'s anti-money laundering regime.  Burma 
has since responded by enacting a powerful new money 
laundering law, seizing assets, and preparing prosecutions in 
several major cases. 
 
III. Country Actions Against Drugs 
 
A. Policy Initiatives 
 
Burma\'s official counternarcotics plan calls for the 
eradication of all narcotics production and trafficking over 
a fifteen year period, starting in 1999.  The plan is to 
proceed by stages, with eradication efforts coupled to 
alternative development programs in individual townships, 
predominantly in Shan State.  Altogether, 54 townships have 
been targeted, 25 of which are to be taken on during the 
first five years of the program. 
 
The government has received very limited international 
assistance in support of these efforts.  The most significant 
is UNDCP\'s Wa Alternative Development Project (WADP) which is 
financed by the United States, Japan and, since 2002, 
Germany.  A five-year, $12.1 million program, this project 
encourages alternative development in a small portion of the 
territory controlled by the United Wa State Army.  There is 
also a small, U.S.-financed project in Northern Shan State 
(Project Old Soldier) and a Japanese effort to establish 
buckwheat as a cash crop in the Kokang and Mong Ko regions of 
northeastern Shan State.  In addition, the Thai government 
agreed in 2001 to extend its own alternative development 
projects across the border into the Wa-controlled Southern 
Military Region of Shan State. 
 
B. Accomplishments 
 
Narcotics Seizures: Summary statistics provided by the 
Burmese police indicate that the Burmese police, army, and 
the Customs Service together seized approximately 1,631 
kilograms of raw opium, 285 kilograms of heroin, and 8.8 
million methamphetamine pills during the first ten months of 
2002.  This compares with seizures of 1,629 kilograms of raw 
opium, 97 kilograms of heroin, and 32 million methamphetamine 
pills during all of 2000.  Major cases included the following: 
 
--    In cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the Australian Federal Police, Burmese 
police contributed to the seizure of 357 kilograms of heroin 
in Fiji in October 2000.  Death sentences were eventually 
handed down in Yangon for two drug kingpins connected with 
this case. 
 
--    In cooperation with Thailand, Burmese police 
contributed to the seizure of 116 kilograms of heroin and 7.8 
million methamphetamine tablets in February 2002.  Two of the 
principals behind this shipment were also eventually 
convicted in Yangon and sentenced to \"indefinite\" (i.e., 
unending) terms in prison. 
 
--    In cooperation with China, Burmese police have 
contributed to a series of arrests and seizures throughout 
2001 and 2002 all along the Chinese border.  Altogether, 
Burma has turned over 22 fugitives to China, including 
members of one group (Tan Xiao Lin and company) which China 
described as the \"largest armed drug-trafficking gang in the 
Golden Triangle.\" 
--    In cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement 
Administration and China, Burmese police contributed to the 
seizure of 12.5 kilograms of heroin in Hong Kong on July 11, 
2002.   Evidence collected in that case will provide the 
basis for one of the first prosecutions in Burma under the 
GOB\'s new money laundering law. 
 
--    In cooperation with Thailand and the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration, Burmese police arrested Yang 
Chia-ho, a Kokang Chinese who is reportedly a confederate of 
the notorious Wa captain, Wei Hsueh Kang.  Yang Chia-ho was 
taken into custody together with more than 5 million 
methamphetamine tablets and 41 kilos of heroin in Tachileik, 
Burma on October 4, 2002. 
 
Arrests and Prosecutions: Over the past fourteen years, the 
Burmese government has made almost 90,000 arrests on 
drug-related charges.  Of those arrested, 42 were eventually 
sentenced to death, 37 were given life imprisonment, and an 
additional 12,500 were given prison terms of more than 10 
years.  During the first eight months of 2002, Burma has 
arrested another 4,148 suspects.  It has also continued with 
prosecutions.  Altogether, the Burmese government has brought 
more than 4,000 separate cases against narcotics traffickers 
over the past two years; 2,592 of these cases were prosecuted 
in 2001; 1,475 during the first seven months of 2002.  Of 
these cases, 172 were dismissed for lack of sufficient 
evidence and 259 defendants were acquitted.  The remainder (a 
total of 3,853 over the full nineteen months) were convicted. 
 Six were given the death penalty; 137 were given \"unlimited\" 
sentences; 10 were given life sentences; and 1,927 were given 
sentences in excess of 10 years.  The remainder were given 
sentences of less than 10 years. 
 
Refineries:  The GOB destroyed 14 heroin labs in 2001 and 7 
through the first nine months of 2002.  It has also destroyed 
6 meth labs during the first nine months of 2002. 
 
Precursor Chemicals:  In 2002, the Ministry of Health issued 
notification No. 1/2002 identifying 25 substances as 
precursor chemicals and prohibiting their import, sale, or 
use in Burma.  Seizures of precursor chemicals during the 
first nine months of 2002 included 1,220 kilos of ephedrine, 
2,908 kilos of acetic anhydride, and 21,552 kilos of other 
chemicals.  In 2001, the totals were 3,922 kilos of 
ephedrine, 12,318 liters of acetic anhydride, and 174,191 
liters of other chemicals. 
 
Eradication: The GOB eradicated more than 50,000 acres of 
opium poppy over the past two crop years.  Of this, 26,113 
acres were destroyed during the 2000/01 crop year; 25,862 
acres during 2001/02.  In addition, the GOB burned 164,000 
kilos of poppy seeds capable of seeding more than 40,000 
hectares during the six month period between April and 
October 2002.  According to the Burmese government, the 
destruction of those seeds, together with law enforcement 
actions is expected to reduce the acreage under opium 
cultivation by about half in 2003. 
 
C. Law Enforcement Measures 
 
Drug-enforcement efforts in Burma are led by the Central 
Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), which is comprised 
of personnel from various security services, including the 
police, customs, military intelligence, and the army.  CCDAC 
now has 18 drug-enforcement task forces around the country, 
with most located in major cities and along key transit 
routes near Burma\'s borders with China, India, and Thailand. 
As is the case with most Burmese government entities, CCDAC 
suffers badly from a lack of adequate resources to support 
its law-enforcement mission. 
 
The legal framework for Burma\'s law enforcement efforts is 
provided by its 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances Law.  As demanded by the 1988 UN Drug Convention, 
that law contains legal tools for addressing money 
laundering, the seizure of drug-related assets, and the 
prosecution of drug conspiracy cases. 
 
Burma was placed on the Financial Action Task Force\'s list of 
non-cooperating territories in June 2001 because of 
continuing deficiencies in its anti-money laundering regime. 
In response, the GOB enacted a powerful new money laundering 
law in 2002 which criminalized money laundering in connection 
with most major offenses.  A Central Control Board chaired by 
the Minister of Home Affairs was established in July; 
training for financial investigators was conducted in Rangoon 
and Mandalay in August and September; the initial 
investigations were begun in July; and, using the provisions 
of the law, assets have been frozen and/or seized in several 
major narcotics-related cases.  The first prosecutions under 
the new law should take place within the next several months. 
 With assistance from UNDCP, the Burmese government is also 
in the process of drafting a new mutual legal assistance law, 
which should lay the groundwork for judicial and law 
enforcement cooperation across borders in the prosecution of 
money laundering and other cases. 
 
In 2000 and 2001, the Burmese government also launched its 
first major campaigns against trafficking by former insurgent 
groups.  In November 2000, the GOB took advantage of a mutiny 
within the Mong Ko Defense Army to seize Mong Ko and put that 
band and its leader, Mong Sa La, out of the narcotics 
business.  It also sharply stepped up its pressure on the 
Kokang Chinese, who missed their year 2000 target for 
establishing an \"opium free\" zone throughout their 
self-administered territories.  Starting in September 2001, 
the Burmese joined with the Chinese government in a series of 
joint operations which resulted in the destruction of heroin 
factories and meth labs throughout the Kokang Chinese Special 
Region No. 1 and the arrest of major traffickers. 
 
In 2001, for the first time, the government also established 
a police and military intelligence presence in the Wa 
territories. In March, 2002, it demanded that new 
counternarcotics decrees be issued by the Wa, the Kokang 
Chinese, and other cease-fire groups.  Those decrees outlawed 
participation in any aspect of the narcotics trade.  In April 
and May 2002, the GOB also demanded and received cooperation 
from the United Wa State Army in bringing to heel several 
major fugitives wanted by China.  In addition, it has closed 
down the liaison offices of armed groups like the United Wa 
State Army, and of companies associated with those groups in 
Tachileik, Myawaddy, and other towns on the Thai/Burmese 
border.  Finally, the GOB continued efforts to hold 
cease-fire groups to their pledges to end opium production in 
their territories.  U Sai Lin\'s Special Region No. 4 around 
Mong La has been opium-free since 1997 and the Wa are, thus 
far, on track to eliminate opium by 2005.  The Kokang Chinese 
missed their opium-free target (scheduled for the year 2000), 
but have paid a heavy price for that failure in terms of 
increased attention from both the Burmese and the Chinese 
police. 
In 2001, the GOB also began a crackdown on the array of 
militias (some government-sponsored Ka Kwe Ye; i.e., village 
defense forces, and others the remnants of former insurgent 
bands) that the GOB had previously allowed to cultivate opium 
in the Kutkai-Lashio region of northern Shan State. 
According to military intelligence officials, with peace now 
prevailing in most of the countryside and the government no 
longer in need of the local security services these groups 
provided, steps are now being taken to slowly claw back their 
privileges, including the right to grow and traffic opium. 
 
D. Corruption 
 
There is no evidence that the Burmese Government is directly 
involved in the drug trade.  However, officials, particularly 
army and police personnel posted in outlying areas, have been 
prosecuted for drug abuse and/or narcotics-related 
corruption.  According to the Burmese government, over 200 
police officials and 48 Burmese Army personnel have been 
punished for narcotics-related corruption or drug abuse 
between 1995 and May 2002.  Of the 200 police officers, 130 
were imprisoned, 16 were dismissed from the service, 7 were 
forced to retire, and 47 were demoted. 
 
E. Agreements and Treaties 
 
Burma is a party to the 1961 UN Single Convention, the 1971 
UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention.  It has also announced that it will shortly 
adhere to the 1972 Protocol to the 1961 Single Convention. 
In addition, is also one of six nations (Burma, Cambodia, 
China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam) that are parties to UNDCP\'s 
sub-regional action plan for controlling precursor chemicals 
and reducing illicit narcotics production and trafficking in 
the highlands of Southeast Asia. The GOB has signed bilateral 
drug control agreements with India in 1993, with Bangladesh 
in 1994, with Vietnam in 1995, and with the Russian 
Federation, Laos, and the Philippines in 1997. 
 
Burma is part of every major multilateral narcotics control 
program in the region.  In November 2001, Burma agreed to 
contribute to the ACCORD plan of action, which serves as an 
umbrella for a variety of global programs aimed at 
strengthening the rule of law, promoting alternative 
development, and increasing civic awareness of the dangers of 
drugs.  It has also supported the 1993 Memorandum of 
Understanding that was signed among the six regional states 
-- Burma, China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia -- to 
control narcotics production in Southeast Asia. 
 
In 2001, Burma signed additional counternarcotics MOUs with 
China (in January) and Thailand (in June).  The MOU with 
China, in particular, laid down the ground rules for joint 
operations, which in turn led to a series of arrests and 
renditions of major traffickers during the spring and summer 
of 2001 (see below). 
 
Burma\'s MOU with Thailand commits both countries to closer 
police cooperation in narcotics control.  In August 2001, 
both countries also agreed to establish joint \"narcotics 
suppression coordination stations\" in the Chiang 
Rai/Tachileik, Mae Sot/Myawaddy, and Ranong/Kawthoung border 
areas.  In addition, during Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt\'s 
September visit to Thailand, Thailand also offered 20 million 
baht (about $440,000) for the establishment of a new 
alternative development program in the Southern Military 
Region of Shan State, which is now occupied by the United Wa 
State Army. 
 
This nascent counter-narcotics cooperation between Thailand 
and Burma was interrupted by tensions on the border during 
the summer of 2002.  However, as tensions have eased, 
cooperation has resumed. 
 
Finally, Burma has continued its operational cooperation with 
DEA, the Australian Federal Police, and other western and 
regional police agencies.  In April, that cooperation 
resulted in the arrest of two Burmese citizens who were 
accused of exporting 357 kilograms of heroin to Fiji (see 
above).  Both have since been tried, convicted, and sentenced 
to death. 
 
F. Cultivation and Production 
 
According to the US/Burma Joint Opium Yield Survey, opium 
production declined in Burma for the sixth straight year in 
2002. The survey found that the maximum potential yield for 
opium in Burma in 2002 totaled only 630 metric tons, down 235 
metric tons (or approximately 26 percent) from 2001. Over the 
past six years, opium production in Burma has declined by 
more than 75 percent, from an estimated 2,560 metric tons in 
1996 to only 630 metric tons in 2002.  The area under 
cultivation has dropped by more than half, from 163,100 
hectares in 1996 to approximately 78,000 acres in 2002. 
Yields have similarly been cut by more than half, from an 
estimated 17 kilograms per hectare in 1996 to levels (about 
8.0 kilograms per hectare in 2001) that are now comparable to 
those in neighboring states such as Laos. 
 
Results from a UNDCP-sponsored census survey throughout Shan 
State in 2002 largely corroborated these results. According 
to UNDCP, Burma produced approximately 828 metric tons of 
opium on 81,000 hectares of land in 2002. 
 
G. Drug Flow/Transit 
 
Most ATS and heroin in Burma is produced in small, mobile 
labs located in the Burma/China and Burma/Thailand border 
areas, primarily in territories controlled by active or 
former insurgent groups.  A growing amount of methamphetamine 
is reportedly produced in labs co-located with heroin 
refineries in areas controlled by the United Wa State Army, 
the Kokang Chinese, and the Shan State Army - South.  Heroin 
and methamphetamine produced by these groups are trafficked 
primarily through China, Thailand and, to a lesser extent, 
Laos, India, Bangladesh, and Burma itself. 
 
Precursors for the trade are primarily produced in India, 
China, Thailand, and other regional states.  Burma does not 
have a chemical industry and does not produce ephedrine, 
acetic anhydride, or any of the other chemicals required for 
the narcotics trade.  Similarly, the major markets for all of 
these narcotic drugs lie in neighboring states.  Relatively 
little is sold in Burma itself. 
H. Demand reduction 
 
The overall level of drug abuse is low in Burma compared with 
neighboring countries.  According to the GOB, there are only 
about 70,000 \"officially registered\" drug abusers in Burma. 
While this is undoubtedly an underestimate, even UNDCP 
estimates that there may be no more than 300,000 people 
(still less than 1 percent of the population) who abuse drugs 
in Burma.  Most, particularly among the older generation, use 
opium, but use of heroin and synthetic drugs is rising, 
particularly in urban and mining areas. 
 
Burmese demand reduction programs are in part coercive and in 
part voluntary.  Addicts are required to register and can be 
prosecuted if they fail to register and accept treatment. 
Altogether, more 21,000 addicts were prosecuted for failing 
to register between 1994 and April 2002. 
 
Demand reduction programs and facilities are strictly 
limited, however.  There are six major drug treatment centers 
under the Ministry of Health, 49 other smaller detox centers, 
and 8 rehabilitation centers which, together, have reportedly 
provided treatment to about 55,000 addicts over the past 9 
years.  There are also a variety of narcotics awareness 
programs conducted through the public school system. 
According to UNDCP, approximately 1,200 high school teachers 
participated in seminars, training programs, and workshops 
connected with these programs in 2001.  In addition, the 
government has established demand reduction programs in 
cooperation with INGOs.  These include programs with CARE 
Myanmar, World Concern, and Population Services 
International, all of which focus on injecting drug use as a 
factor in the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
 
IV.  U.S. Policy Initiatives 
 
A.    Policy and Programs 
 
Direct USG counternarcotics assistance to Burma has been 
suspended since 1988, when the Burmese military suppressed 
the pro-democracy movement.  The USG now engages the Burmese 
government in regard to narcotics control only on a very 
limited level.  DEA, through the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon, 
shares drug-related intelligence with the GOB and conducts 
joint drug-enforcement investigations with Burmese 
counternarcotics authorities.  Other U.S. agencies have 
conducted opium yield surveys in the mountainous regions of 
the Shan State in 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 
and 2002 with essential assistance provided by Burmese 
counterparts.  These surveys give both governments an 
accurate understanding of the scope, magnitude, and changing 
geographic distribution of Burma\'s opium crop. 
 
The U.S. Government regularly urges the Burmese government to 
continue to take steps to curb narcotics production and 
trafficking.  Specifically, we have encouraged the Burmese 
government to: 
 
--    Comply with the provisions of UN Drug Conventions by 
taking demonstrable and verifiable actions against high level 
drug traffickers and their organizations; 
 
--    Increase opium eradication and significantly increase 
seizure rates for opium, heroin, and methamphetamines; 
control the diversion of precursor chemicals; and destroy 
significantly more heroin and methamphetamine laboratories; 
--    Continue cooperation with China and Thailand and expand 
cooperation to other neighboring countries such as India; 
 
--    Enforce existing money laundering laws, including asset 
forfeiture provisions, and fully implement and enforce 
Burma\'s new money laundering legislation; 
 
--    Prosecute drug-related corruption, especially corrupt 
government and military officials who facilitate drug 
trafficking and money laundering; and 
 
--    Expand demand reduction, prevention and drug treatment 
programs to reduce drug use and control the spread of 
HIV/AIDS. 
 
B. Bilateral Cooperation 
 
USG counternarcotics cooperation with the Burmese regime is 
restricted to basic law-enforcement operations.  The U.S. 
provides no bilateral material or training assistance.  DEA\'s 
liaison with Burmese policy makers and military officials -- 
conducted mainly through DEA\'s office in Rangoon -- focuses 
on providing intelligence on enforcement targets and 
coordinating investigations of international drug-trafficking 
groups. 
 
C. The Road Ahead 
 
The Burmese government has committed itself in recent years 
to effective counternarcotics measures, has found major 
regional allies (particularly China) in this fight, and has 
built up the capacity to identify and punish drug traffickers 
and major trafficking organizations, even within the context 
of very limited resources.  Based on experience in dealing 
with significant narcotics-trafficking problems elsewhere in 
the world, the USG recognizes that large-scale and long-term 
international aid -- including development assistance and 
law-enforcement aid -- would help curb drug production and 
trafficking in Burma.  However, recurring human rights 
problems have limited international support of all kinds, 
including support for Burma\'s law enforcement efforts.  The 
USG believes that the Government of Burma should continue to 
combat corruption, enforce its narcotics and money-laundering 
legislation, and deal with drug abuse.  Its efforts have 
produced measurable results.  Continued, they could lead to a 
sustained reduction in all forms of narcotics production and 
trafficking from an area that has been one of the world\'s 
major drug trafficking centers.

Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (U)  Summary:  In a recent visit to the small border town 
of Myawaddy in eastern Karen State, Poloff found some 
residual conflict between regime forces and Karen National 
Union (KNU) forces.  Although the KNU appears to have been 
reduced to hit and run, guerilla-type attacks, the rugged 
mountain terrain has thwarted regime efforts to gain total 
control of the area.  The border with Thailand in this area 
of Karen State appeared quite porous with Burmese workers and 
small shipments of goods moving back and forth to Thailand, 
mostly outside official channels.  Aside from the township of 
Myawaddy, which is closely tied to the Thai economy, the 
areas in this part of Burma are suffering badly from the 
continued fighting and failed economic and social programs of 
the SPDC.  While the local population complained bitterly 
about the regime there was little evidence of support for the 
KNU\'s continued raids, which disrupt commercial activities. 
The NLD was reorganizing in several towns we visited and its 
leaders said it has more support than ever due to the failed 
policies of the SPDC. End Summary. 
 
The Road Less Traveled..... 
 
2. (U)  Poloff traveled by car from Rangoon to the eastern 
Karen State border town of Myawaddy from November 19-21. 
This was the first time in recent years that the SPDC had 
allowed a foreigner other than International Committee for 
the Red Cross staff to travel to Myawaddy from Rangoon. 
(Ironically, foreigners can freely enter Myawaddy from the 
Thailand side of the border between the hours 6 a.m. and 6 
p.m.)  The drive took a bone rattling 13 hours over two days 
to cover just 290 miles. 
 
Thamanya Sayadaw 
 
3. (U)  The venerable Buddhist Abbot Thamanya Sayadaw is a 
vocal, if slightly eccentric, advocate of political change in 
Burma living near the town of Hpa\'an.  Besides seeing to the 
upgrading of local roads, the Sayadaw provides protection and 
support for a growing community of followers near his 
monastery.  The Sayadaw\'s community appeared to be thriving; 
businesses were active, homes were wooden instead of thatch, 
and there were more cars, trucks, and motorcycles than in 
towns nearer to Bago, thanks to contributions from around 
Burma which the Sayadaw has funneled back into his community. 
 We were told that while the SPDC does not approve of the 
Sayadaw\'s politics (Aung San Suu Kyi\'s first trip from 
Rangoon after her May 6 release was to see him) they 
grudgingly accept his community activities because he is so 
popular with the people. 
 
4. (U)  Given the fractious political situation in Burma and 
the lack of government funding for public projects, the 
Sayadaw appears to have carved out a small but healthy patch 
of civil society.  In many ways, he is the epitome of a 
Buddhist saint -- a source of grace and charity for his 
people, who in turn accept his claims of semi-divine status. 
The people, in any case, work hard and share in the benefits 
of a functioning community. 
 
6. (U)  The abysmal condition of the rest of the roads from 
Bago to Hpa\'an (at some points it was easier taking the ox 
cart path than to stay on the road) was indicative of the 
generally backward conditions in the area outside the 
Thamanya\'s safety net.  While the economy is agrarian, it 
appears to be limited to small-scale subsistence farming.  In 
one area there were remnants of what once must have been 
large rubber plantations.  Now, families harvest the rubber 
independently, cure the sheets of rubber in front of their 
huts, and sell them for about fifty cents a piece.  The only 
industries visible along the route were a palm oil plant, a 
sugar mill near Hpa\'an and several rock quarries. 
 
Burma Army and DKBA Attempt to Control the Border 
 
7. (U)  Leaving Hpa\'an on the road to Myawaddy, the frequency 
of Burma Army encampments and Democratic Karen Buddhist Army 
(DKBA) patrols increased significantly.  The DKBA, a group 
which rebelled from the largely Christian KNU and reached a 
cease-fire agreement with the SPDC in the late 1990\'s, has 
continued to attract young Karen Buddhists who are looking 
for action.  There are an estimated 5,000 DKBA troops in 
Myawaddy alone and the organization reportedly controls most 
of the economic activity in the corridor from Thailand to 
Hpa\'an.  The DKBA\'s relative wealth was evident as they were 
typically seen in new Ford and Toyota double cab trucks 
carrying five to twelve DKBA \"soldiers\" in the back.  The 
DKBA soldiers\' morale was visibly higher than the Burma Army 
troops, who generally looked sullen and underfed, but it did 
not appear that discipline was high.   Relations between DKBA 
and Burmese Army troops  appeared good, though they did not 
mix forces or appear to socialize together.  We followed one 
DKBA soldier on a motorcycle who was handing out money to 
Burmese soldiers posted along the road.  He told Poloff that 
he was providing \"tea money,\" amounting to about fifty cents, 
to each of soldiers \"just to help them out.\" 
 
8. (U)  DKBA and Burma Army troops were in evidence from a 
checkpoint 30 miles west of the Thai border onward.  As the 
road climbed through the jungle, two or three Burma Army 
soldiers were stationed every few hundred yards.  There were 
signs warning of mines along the roadside and bridges were 
closely guarded and encircled with two sets of bamboo fences, 
presumably to deter KNU attacks on the bridges.  The Burma 
Army had several outposts on the road, each with double 
layers of bamboo fencing that could be closed once traffic 
had passed.  The army troops stationed on the mountain were 
dug-in and remained mostly out of sight.  We were told by 
various sources that there were KNU attacks every week or 
two, mainly by snipers on army troops or ambushes of DKBA 
vehicles on the main road, in addition to skirmishes in the 
jungle.  There were also reportedly villages in the area, 
even within Myawaddy township, that still supported the KNU 
in spite of the government\'s decade long effort to quash 
them. 
 
Myawaddy - Almost Heaven..... 
 
9. (U)  On the outskirts of Myawaddy a long line of buses and 
trucks queued on the road to process through a checkpoint. 
When Poloff arrived at the checkpoint, officials demanded to 
know why he was there and then attempted to search the 
vehicle.  Once cooler heads prevailed the officials backed 
down, but it was clear that the intimidation level for normal 
travelers was quite high.  On the return trip through this 
checkpoint the following morning, there were approximately 
fifty to sixty heavily laden trucks and buses waiting for 
inspection before their journey over the mountain range. 
 
10. (U)  Once in the town of Myawaddy, the heavy military 
presence of the mountain pass and checkpoints gave way to a 
thriving commercial center more closely linked to the economy 
in Thailand than in Burma.  In fact, the residents and 
merchants used the Thai baht instead of the Burmese kyat in 
all transactions.  Also, virtually everyone, even bicycle 
trishaw drivers, carried a Thai cellular telephone. 
Ironically, with landlines to Rangoon down or of such poor 
quality that calls were almost impossible, the cellular 
phones made it easier to call Singapore from Myawaddy than to 
call Rangoon (international rates to Burma are extremely 
high). 
 
11. (U)  There were also many more new vehicles in Myawaddy 
than in areas further inside Burma.  Locals explained that 
the DKBA controls vehicle imports into Myawaddy but the 
vehicles cannot be registered with the Burmese government or 
taken past Myawaddy (although this appears to be loosely 
enforced, as we saw many DKBA in new trucks and motorcycles 
on the road to Hpa\'an).  The prices for these vehicles were 
one-tenth the price of similar vehicles in Rangoon where 
imports are tightly controlled by the SPDC.  One source 
estimated that of the 1,000 vehicles in Myawaddy only 50 were 
registered with the Burmese government.  These fifty, 
however, were said to be the only ones allowed to transit 
freely to Thailand.  Thus, they generated a lot of income for 
their owners by transiting goods and people across the border. 
 
12. (U)  Although Burmese immigration officials prohibited 
Poloff and two accompanying local staff from crossing \"the 
friendship bridge\" into Thailand (\"we cannot allow it without 
instructions from higher authorities\"), other Burmese were 
allowed to cross for a fee of about fifty cents.  Just under 
the bridge, right in front of a Burma Army bunkered machine 
gun nest, there was an active trade in illegal crossings by 
boys with inner tubes willing to paddle passengers across the 
shallow river for a few pennies.  The border is quite porous 
in Karen State, with the Burma Army controlling the two 
\"official\" crossing points, Myawaddy and Three Pagodas Pass, 
while the DKBA controls five other \"major\" crossings.  The 
KNU or others control many smaller crossings.  Thus, we were 
told, when the Burmese government closed the border earlier 
this year, it diminished the flow of people and goods at 
official crossings but most of the traffic just shifted to 
other crossing points. 
 
13. (U)  Poloff attempted to visit the SPDC reception center 
for the repatriation of Burmese migrants from Thailand but 
was blocked from the facility first by an armed soldier, then 
by a military intelligence (MI) officer.  The only 
information the MI officer was willing to share about the 
facility was that it continued to process repatriations even 
while the border was closed and that most returning migrants 
spend only one night at the center before being transferred 
to Hpa\'an for additional processing. 
 
NLD On the Rise 
 
14. (C)  Poloff met with NLD leaders in Hpa\'an, Kawkareik, 
and Myawaddy, all of whom were rebuilding their party 
organizations and believed that the NLD enjoyed more popular 
support now than in 1990.  They all said that while most 
people are still afraid to openly support the NLD, 
frustration with SPDC policies and the economy is very high 
and the people want change.  In Hpa\'an and Myawaddy, the 
leaders said that MI was aware of their reorganization 
activities and was not blocking them (although harassment of 
their families and business activities continued.) 
 
15. (C)  In Kawkareik, the NLD leader said that he did not 
think MI was aware of his reorganization activities but that 
they would be now that we had visited (MI was closely 
monitoring the entire trip).  He said that this was fine, he 
wanted to tell MI the truth and he did not fear their 
reaction.  In 1998, he had closed the NLD office under 
pressure from MI because \"we thought they were going to kill 
us.\"  Recently, he said he senses that MI, at least in his 
town, no longer wants the conflict and is doing the minimum 
to follow up on orders from Rangoon.  Poloff asked that he 
try to get word to NLD headquarters if he was wrong and there 
was any retribution based on Poloff\'s visit (the same message 
was conveyed to each NLD leader visited).  Thus far we have 
received no reports of problems. 
 
16. (C)  Asked if the local population supported the KNU in 
its fight against the SPDC, the NLD leaders opined that while 
the people despise the regime, they also are tired of the 
fighting that disrupts their lives.  They said only a small 
percentage of the population still actively supports the KNU 
while the majority want peaceful change through NLD and Aung 
San Suu Kyi.  Asked if the DKBA would support the NLD if it 
there were free elections, the NLD leaders said it might. 
They noted that DKBA support for the SPDC is based only on 
the economic concessions it receives; otherwise it too 
condemns SPDC policies.  The NLD leaders felt that if the 
DKBA had a choice it would join hands with the NLD.

1. (C)  Summary: On a recent visit to Karen State, Poloff was 
told by an International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) 
representative that the agency is making progress on 
establishing a meaningful presence in the area.  While 
progress has been slow, the ICRC has had some success in 
providing clean water to residents, assisting mine victims, 
and delivering messages to families of prisoners.  The agency 
has also helped improve conditions in labor camps.  The ICRC 
has not yet succeeded in establishing contacts with military 
commanders -- a step ICRC feels is essential for 
investigations of alleged human rights abuses in the area. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  In late November, Poloff met with the head of the 
ICRC office in Karen State, Ms. Amela Husagic.  Ms. Husagic 
and two other ICRC international staff provide coverage of 
Karen State from their offices in the state capital, Hpa\'an. 
Husagic said the ICRC has four priorities in the area: 1) 
water sanitation for hospitals, schools, and homes; 2) 
orthopedic care for mine victims; 3) delivering messages to 
families of prisoners; and 4) protection activities. 
 
3.  (U)  While the ICRC has had a presence in Hpa\'an since 
2000, Husagic said it has been a slow process to gain access 
to local officials and build confidence with them.  The ICRC 
has remained patient, however, has developed good relations 
with key authorities, and is starting to implement programs. 
For example, the ICRC has provided clean water supplies (tube 
wells) for two township hospitals, supplies to build simple 
toilets in some homes and schools, and training to improve 
sanitation.  In addition, in January the office will open an 
orthopedic care facility in Hpa\'an to provide prosthetics and 
therapy for mining victims.  While the ICRC has assisted in 
providing orthopedic care through government clinics in other 
areas of Burma, this is the first independent ICRC orthopedic 
care clinic. 
 
4.  (C)  In providing communications between prisoners and 
their families, Husagic said she and her colleagues have been 
allowed to travel throughout most of Karen State to deliver 
messages to family members.  Identifying and working through 
the process for obtaining government permission to travel has 
been slow, she noted, but now the ICRC has standing 
permission to travel between Hpa\'an and Kawkareik, and other 
specific travel requests are generally processed quickly. 
 
5. (C)  Husagic said her office does not conduct prison 
visits because the only prison in Karen State, on the 
outskirts of Hpa\'an, is under construction and not scheduled 
to open until January 2003.  Her team has requested access to 
two \"New Life\" and other prison labor camps the SPDC has 
established in Karen State.  She explained that the New Life 
camps are a type of labor camp located in previously 
undeveloped border areas the government wants to populate. 
The prisoners at the New Life camps are required to clear the 
jungle, plant agricultural products, and build villages.  The 
prisoners\' families are encouraged to live near the camps and 
are given some land and other incentives to encourage them to 
stay in the area when the prisoners complete their sentences. 
 (Note: The ICRC Head of Delegation in Rangoon told Poloff 
recently that although the New Life idea sounds reasonable, 
the camps have not been successful because of difficult 
living conditions and isolation. End Note.) 
 
6. (C)  Husagic said she has been allowed to visit one of the 
New Life camps and some of the other labor camps in Karen 
State.  While not wanting to provide specific details due to 
ICRC\'s confidentiality rules, she said life in the camps is 
generally quite hard but that ICRC\'s presence has led to some 
improvements. 
 
7. (C)  When Poloff queried whether ICRC had attempted to 
follow-up on allegations of SPDC abuses in Karen State, 
Husagic responded that she has not yet been able to establish 
communications and working relations with the responsible 
officials, i.e. the Burmese military, necessary for this 
activity.  She said that although she had built up good 
contacts with many local township and Military Intelligence 
officials, she did not have access to Burma Army field 
commanders.  She also noted that the lines of authority 
between various military authorities in the field are not 
clear and appear to vary depending on location.  The Nasaka 
(a combined force of MI, Customs, Immigration, and the Police 
Force) appeared to be in charge in certain areas while MI or 
the Army appeared to have the upper hand in other areas. 
This was complicated by the fact that some authorities 
apparently report to the Regional Commander while others 
reported directly to various elements in Rangoon. 
 
8. (C)  Husagic is working to establish the relations 
necessary to extend protection activities in the area.  She 
said she continues to hear credible reports of continuing 
abuses in Karen State and the ICRC will continue to press for 
access in order to mitigate these abuses.  She noted, 
however, that this is the most sensitive aspect of the ICRC\'s 
activities and it will take time to develop.

     B. (B) RANGOON 1059 
 
Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: UNHCR says that forced labor continues in 
northern Rakhine State, but maintains that there has been no 
significant new outflow of refugees from Burma.  According to 
UNHCR\'s Resident Representative, he has pressed the 
government hard regarding forced labor, but may need 
additional support to bring the practice to an end. End 
Summary. 
 
No New Refugees 
 
2. (C) UNHCR\'s Resident Representative Rajiv Kapur told 
Poloff that there had no significant recent outflow of 
refugees from northern Rakhine State.  UNHCR monitors the 
populations in Rohingya Muslim villages in the area and had 
found no change.  He has also talked to the UNHCR office in 
Bangladesh.  According to Kapur, both offices agreed that the 
recent crowds of Rohingya Muslims that had gathered in 
Teknaf, Bangladesh were mostly illegal Burmese migrants who 
had fled the Bangladesh army\'s recent campaigns against 
crime.  Apparently, the migrants felt safer presenting 
themselves as recent refugees than as long-term illegal 
migrants. 
 
Forced Labor 
 
3. (C) Kapur said that he continued to press the government 
hard regarding forced labor in northern Rakhine State. In 
general, the situation had improved.  Forced labor was down 
to very low levels in three of the four townships in which 
UNHCR operates.  The army, military intelligence, and the 
township peace and development committees have sworn off the 
use of forced labor, Kapur stated.  However, the NASAKA 
(Burmese border police) commander in Maungdaw North continued 
to make demands for forced labor.  Altogether, there were 
twenty incidents of forced labor in Maungdaw North in October 
affecting 68 percent of that township\'s 32 villages.  Kapur 
said that he had raised the NASAKA Commander\'s behavior with 
the government (reftel B) to no effect, and, in early 
December, warned Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win that 
the GOB was inviting an adverse reaction from the 
international community by its failure to act.  According to 
Kapur, the meeting was tense, but KMW promised to \"try\" to 
have the problem addressed \"to the extent he could.\" 
However, he cautioned Kapur that the GOB\'s cooperation with 
UNHCR could be affected, \"if there was a mixing of mandates 
among UN agencies.\" 
 
UNDP\'s Resident Representative 
 
4. (C) Kapur recommended that the USG pay special attention 
to the selection of the new UNDP Resident Coordinator for 
Burma.  The right person, he said, could ensure that all UN 
agencies played a role in monitoring human rights abuses, 
something most were reluctant to do now.  He had found that 
you could get a reaction from the government, if you were 
consistent, objective, and firm.  With UN agencies now 
establishing an almost nationwide presence, they could play a 
significant role, given the right leadership.  According to 
Kapur, the Resident Coordinator\'s position had already been 
advertised and the selection would likely be made before 
February. 
 
Comment and Action Recommendations 
 
5. (C)  The UN agencies now are in a position to do far more 
on human rights than they have to date.  Many are 
establishing programs in border regions inhabited by ethnic 
minorities and can play a role in bringing human rights 
abuses to the attention of the SPDC leadership.  Such reports 
may not get immediate action, but they will at least ensure 
that the SPDC can no longer pretend to be ignorant of the 
problems or dismiss them as the fabrications of opposition 
groups.  Motivating the UN agencies to play a role in 
protecting human rights, however, will require the right 
person as UNDP\'s resident coordinator.  We recommend that the 
Department give this some attention and, if we have a 
candidate that can really do the job here, put him or her 
forward. 
 
6. (C) As for Kapur\'s points on forced labor, he will need 
support.  We have weighed in with Khin Nyunt, and will raise 
the issue again.  Other funders of UNHCR\'s program, however, 
should speak up as well.

1. (C)  Summary: India, Thailand, and Burma will do a survey 
of the proposed road link from India to Thailand through 
Burma.  Work of the Kaladan road/river network from Mizoram 
to Sittwe in Burma\'s Rakhine State is also moving forward.  A 
Thai/Burmese border committee meeting from December 26 to 28 
will focus on \"border security,\" while January will see a 
series of visits by Thai Army officers to Rangoon, including 
Supreme Commander Surayud.  End Summary. 
 
Road Link 
 
2. (C) The Indian DCM, Rahul Kulshrestha, and the Thai 
Political Counselor, Kallayana Vipattipumiprates, told Poloff 
that the trilateral meeting held in Rangoon December 4 and 5 
resulted in an agreement for \"technical field study\" on the 
route alignment for the proposed road from Tamu on the 
Burmese/Indian border to Myawaddy on the Thai/Burmese border. 
 According to both, the survey is intended to resolve 
differences between Burma, which argued for new roads in many 
areas, and India and Thailand, which want to use as much of 
the current road structure as possible.  The survey will take 
place in March or April and will set the stage for a 
follow-up, \"senior level\" meeting, probably in June 2003, 
that will focus on sources of financing.  According to 
Kulshrestha, the road will be a two lane \"class III standard\" 
road running from Tamu to Pagan and then down through 
Nyaunglebin to Moulmein, Hpa\'an, and Myawaddy.  The Indians 
are to take care of the stretch to Pagan, the Burmese the 
section from Pagan to Moulmein, and the Thais the part from 
Moulmein to Myawaddy. 
 
3. (C) The road makes sense for all three nations, according 
to Kulshrestha and Vipattipumiprates.  For India, the road 
will provide an outlet to the sea (through Rangoon) for 
Manipur and other provinces in India\'s northeast.  For 
Thailand, a good road from Myawaddy to Moulmein will 
facilitate trade with Burma and access to the sea for areas 
in Thailand\'s northwest.  For Burma, the road will improve 
communications and solidify links with Thailand and India. 
 
Kaladan Road/River Network 
 
4. (C) According to Kulshrestha, work on the proposed Kaladan 
Road/River network is also moving ahead.  That network will 
run from Saiha in Mizoram down through Burma\'s Chin State to 
the Kaladan River and out to the sea by Sittwe.  For India, 
the road/river network\'s purpose is basically the same as the 
India/Thailand road link above; it is intended to provide an 
outlet to the sea for Mizoram and other states in India\'s 
northeast. 
 
Thai/Burmese Border Committee Meeting 
 
5. (C) A Thai/Burmese Border Committee meeting has been 
scheduled for December 26 to 28.  The topic will be \"border 
security.\"  According to Vipattipumiprates, who will attend, 
that means both drugs and the remaining Burmese insurgents in 
Thailand. 
 
Visits 
 
6. (C) In a good sign for bilateral relations, there will be 
a series of visits by Thai Army officers to Rangoon next 
month.  According to Vipattipumiprates, the Thai Army 
Commander in Chief Somdhat is due to visit from January 20 to 
January 22, followed by the new Thai Defense Minister 
Thammarak with the Supreme Commander Surayud and the other 
Chiefs of Service in tow.  One of the Thai princesses is also 
reportedly scheduled to come as a representative of the Thai 
king sometime in March.

SUBJECT: AUTHORITIES ATTEMPT TO BLOCK ASSK IN RAKHINE STATE 
 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  Authorities have attempted to block 
citizens from greeting Aung San Suu Kyi over the last four 
days as she toured Rakhine State in western Burma.  ASSK has 
commended those who have turned out for their bravery and 
scolded authorities for threatening instead of serving the 
people.  The orders to interfere with the visit appear to 
have come from the USDA (under Senior General Than Shwe) 
while military intelligence (under Secretary One Khin Nyunt) 
claims to have no role in these activities.  This appears to 
be an indication of potentially significant differences 
within the regime on how best to manage ASSK\'s growing public 
support.  The remaining five days of the trip may give an 
idea of which approach will hold sway.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  NLD Secretary U Lwin told Poloff that authorities 
have taken actions over the last four days to block citizens 
from turning out to see Aung San Suu Kyi as she tours Rakhine 
State in western Burma.  He said citizens were warned to not 
show any support for ASSK when she passed through their 
towns, and fire brigade, police, and Union Solidarity and 
Development Association (USDA) members turned out to 
discourage anyone who defied the warnings.  (Note:  The USDA 
is a mass organization under the regime\'s control.  End Note) 
 Still, according to U Lwin, the people did turn out, in 
crowds ranging from an estimated 10,000 to 50,000 people, 
surprising even the NLD in their determination to see ASSK. 
When authorities reacted with riot police and fire trucks, 
ASSK intervened, leaving her vehicle, climbing atop a fire 
truck, and angrily chiding the authorities for threatening 
the people they were supposed to be serving.  She commended 
the people for their bravery in exercising their rights to 
come and listen to her, saying that she continues to work 
with the government and the people for positive change in the 
country. 
 
3.  (C)  U Lwin said he provided the above information to 
press reporters on December 19 at the request of ASSK, who 
was becoming frustrated with the continued harassment by 
authorities.  He said he had received daily updates from ASSK 
on the three previous days on efforts to block her visit and 
had transmitted these concerns to Military Intelligence in 
Rangoon to no avail.  On the fourth day, when yet another 
incident occurred, ASSK said it was time for U Lwin to make 
the harrassment known to the press.  She also asked that he 
convey to Military Intelligence reports that USDA Central 
Executive Committee Member (and Minister for Post and 
Telecommunications, and Hotels and Tourism) Thein Zaw had 
come to Rakhine State just prior to her visit and given 
instructions that citizens were not to show any support for 
ASSK.  Interestingly, when U Lwin told Brigadier General Than 
Tun, MI\'s interlocutor with the NLD, about the planned press 
conference and Thein Zaw\'s activities, Than Tun responded 
that MI was doing all it could to facilitate ASSK\'s travels, 
that he did know or have control over what Thein Zaw was 
doing, and that U Lwin should go ahead with the press 
conference.  U Lwin said he intentionally chose not to 
mention Thein Zaw by name to the press but that they know 
that the USDA is playing a leading role in obstructing the 
visit. 
 
4.  U Lwin attested that MI has been very responsive to the 
NLD\'s requests for support during ASSK\'s travel.  He noted 
that they have held roads open for her late at night and 
waived document checks at normal checkpoints.  He said that 
Thein Zaw\'s actions to prevent citizens from seeing ASSK 
appear to be coming from the USDA hierarchy, which ultimately 
leads to the Patron of the organization, Senior General Than 
Shwe.  While U Lwin did not want to speculate on the 
significance of MI\'s effort to distance itself from USDA\'s 
actions in Rakhine State, he did acknowledge that it appeared 
to represent a split in how different elements of the SPDC 
are reacting to ASSK\'s travel. 
 
5.  We spoke to three NLD Members of Parliament-elect from 
Mandalay Division about this incident; all thought it was 
extremely positive as it highlighted ASSK\'s determination to 
stand up to repressive measures.  They added that her 
admonition to local authorities not to thwart democracy and 
the peoples\' will would resonate well with many public sector 
employees.  When we asked about potential fallout from the 
SPDC, they opined (perhaps naively) that ASSK cannot now be 
detained or fettered without risking a major reaction.  One 
of the MPs-elect said the NLD\'s statements citing overzealous 
local authorities as the cause of the problem might give the 
SPDC a way to play down the incident, should they choose to 
do so. 
 
6.  Comment:  Tens of thousands of people in an \"ethnic\" 
state reportedly cheering on ASSK as she faced down security 
authorities cannot be a comforting image to the generals in 
Rangoon.  The apparent lack of communication and coordination 
between the USDA hierarchy (under Senior General Than Shwe) 
and the MI hierarchy (under Secretary One Khin Nyunt) may be 
a telling indicator of differing strategies for dealing with 
ASSK and her popular appeal.  As the rest of the trip plays 
out (she is expected to be on the road for about 5 more days) 
we may get a better idea of whether these differences are 
fundamental or superficial.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: A WA SELF-PORTRAIT 
 
 
1.  Summary: A paper prepared by the Wa for international 
visitors to their territories portrays their region as a 
relatively poor, but developing part of Myanmar that is 
struggling to rid itself of opium.  The Wa describe their 
Special Region as an indivisible part of Burma, though they 
also underline their continued interest in autonomy.  Some of 
the points ring true; others; e.g., regarding the Wa 
commitment to democratic principles, are simply hilarious. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  In paragraph 8 below is a lightly editted paper that was 
drafted by the United Wa State Party last Spring for 
distribution to international visitors.  While it is 
obviously meant to present the Wa in the best light, it does 
make some interesting points.  First, in a telling comment on 
the real state of power relationships between the GOB and the 
Wa, the very first line commits the Wa flatly to the Union of 
Burma.  It states that \"Wa State is an indivisible part of 
the Union of Myanmar.\"  Autonomy is still an issue of 
interest to them, but, at least according to this paper, 
independence is not. 
 
3. The paper also provides a purported breakdown of revenue 
for Wa State (as the UWSA calls its territories along Shan 
State\'s borders with China and Thailand), at least in 
percentage terms.  The interesting lines are the \"allocation 
from the Union government,\" which represents the development 
and food subsidies provided by the GOB; the tax, which, 
according to Wa Chairman Pauk Yu Chan, mostly represents a 
tax on opium; and the \"partner\'s share fund,\" which probably 
represents the whole variety of kickbacks which the Wa 
receive from criminal gangs operating in and through their 
teritories. 
 
4.  There are no numbers for the value of the revenue, but it 
is not hard to do some calculations from numbers which Pauk 
Yu Chan provided to Poloff and representatives from the 
German and British embassies on November 27.  According to 
Pauk Yu Chan, about half the UWSP\'s revenue goes to pay the 
salaries of members of the United Wa State Army and the 
United Wa State Party, all of whom are paid at a rate of one 
Chinese Yuan per day.  Assuming 25,000 personnel total in 
both the UWSA and the UWSP, that works out to total 
expenditures on salaries of less than $10 million and total 
Wa revenues of less than $20 million. 
 
5.  That $20 million number for revenues is also roughly 
compatible with figures Pauk Yu Chan provided for the Wa 
opium tax.  According to Pauk Yu Chan, the opium tax, levied 
at a rate of about 7 percent of the value of the crop, brings 
in about 12 percent of the UWSP\'s total revenue.  Given 
UNDCP\'s estimate of opium production in Wa territories (22 
percent of Burma\'s total crop; i.e., the equivalent of 120 to 
160 metric tons), and a farmgate price of between $125 and 
$150 per kilogram for raw opium gum in Wa State, the overall 
value of the Wa opium crop would be somewhere between $15 
million and $20 million, and the take to the UWSP from the 
opium tax somewhere between $1 million and $1.4 million. 
While there are ways to move this number up or down (e.g., if 
the Wa convert some of the opium to heroin, or tax only a 
portion of the opium crop), the final total for the UWSP\'s 
annual revenues will still probably come out somewhere in the 
range of $20 million.  There is, of course, no way to know 
whether the accounts in the paper are complete or if the 
figures provided by Pauk Yu Chan are correct.  If they are, 
however, then Wa financial resources may be a good deal less 
than many assume. 
 
6. The list of public works completed by the UWSP over the 
past 14 years is also fairly remarkable.  It is also probably 
accurate.  Every visitor to the Wa territories is struck by 
the sharp contrast between the state of development in the 
territories controlled by the Wa as opposed to conditions in 
GOB-controlled areas of Shan State.  Working phones, 
hard-paved roads, and 24-hour per day electricity from 
hydropower plants that are still only working at one-third of 
capacity suggest that at least some of the Wa revenues (and 
probably a large portion) have been invested in the 
development of the region. 
 
7.  Finally, the Wa claim to have eliminated about half the 
opium cultivation in their territories over the past 12 
years.  That proportion may be correct, but no one can really 
tell since there were no international observers in the area 
in 1990.  However, the Wa are wildly wrong regarding their 
estimate of current production.  According to the Wa, their 
territories now produce only 30 metric tons of opium per 
year.  According to UNDCP, the total is probably somewhere 
between 120 and 160 metric tons. 
 
8. Begin text: 
 
I.  Brief Introduction of Wa State 
 
Wa State is an indivisible part of Union of Myanmar, as a 
minority autonomous region (People\'s Government of Wa State), 
we only ask the Union Government to grant us more power in 
self-administration. 
 
In the past history of Wa Region, it was a territory of 
anarchy without organization and leadership.  In the period 
of Communist Party of Myanmar, as the second stage in the 
history of Wa region, there were mainly wars and few 
constructions in the region, which brought only disaster to 
Wa people.  Therefore, we seceded from the Communist Party of 
Myanmar in 1989, established Special Region (Wa State) 
Government, Myanmar.  The People\'s Government of Wa State has 
subdivisions with different levels as follows:  County 
Government, Town Government, Township Government.  There is 
also a chief and secretary in every village.  We use these 
governing entities to administer Wa territory.  Our principle 
is governing with democratic means and laws. 
 
We mainly use persuasion and education in our administration, 
and executive methods as a supplement. 
 
In past years, the Union Government has created a peaceful 
and stable environment for our construction, supplied us with 
great support in finance, materials, techniques, etc.  For 
instance, the Union Government has given us hundreds of sites 
in Mengsuk, Mohkuk and Phakant to exploit ruby and jade 
mines, and permitted us to establish trading companies in 
many cities in Myanmar.  We sincerely thank the Union 
Government for its concerns and supports. 
 
WADP (Wa Alternative Development Project) and other 
international charities have made great efforts to help us 
with drug control in recent years; they have developed many 
projects in Wa State and made some achievements.  The Wa 
people express their sincere thanks. 
 
The Wa people have already understood that opium poppy cannot 
bring them fortune but disasters, and opium has damaged their 
health and mind, blocked Wa\'s development of productivity. 
Therefore, the Wa State has made up its mind to eradicate 
opium poppy growing, change its poor economic structure, 
rebuild new communities, and increase the pace of social 
modernization. 
 
II.  Revenue Resource 
 
1.  From the allocation of the Union Government     20% 
2.  Incomes from trading business                   21% 
3.  Tax                                             14% 
4.  Partner\'s share fund                            21% 
5.  Mine products                                   20% 
6.  Tourism industry                                 4% 
 
III.  Development and Construction plan 
 
A.  Education: Thirteen years ago, there were only 20 primary 
schools with 480 students in Wa region.  There are 289 
schools with 20,754 students now, including 5 middle schools. 
 
B.  Health Care: There were only 4 hospitals and 8 clinics 
with 150 persons as medicine staff in Wa region 13 years ago. 
 There are 20 hospitals and 160 clinics with 590 persons as 
medicine team in Wa State now. 
 
C.  Energy Resource Construction: Wa people used oil pine 
wood and oil lamp for lighting in the long history.  There 
was only a hydro power station with 40 kilowatts capacity in 
the Wa region 13 years ago, which was not sufficient for 
lighting in Pangkham.  In period of peaceful construction, we 
have built 7 hydro power stations with 13,900 kilowatts 
capacity in the past 10 years. 
 
D.  Road Construction: There were a few raw roads with a 
total length of only 300 km in Wa region 13 years ago; the 
total length of roads is now 3,000 km.  There are main roads 
with 730 km in the northern part of Wa State, most of them 
are paved with cubic stones, and more than 30 bridges have 
been built with the roads.  Now all the counties are 
connected with roads paved with cubic stone; all towns are 
connected with raw roads.  We have achieved our Ten Years 
Plan in road construction; the road system can basically 
supply transportation in Wa State. 
 
There are standard roads paved with sand and rubble for 505 
km in the southern part of Wa State, with 47 bridges. 
 
E.  Local industry: Wa State has developed its local industry 
in some sectors, such as Hongpang Distillery, Cigarette 
Factory (40,000 cases per year as product capacity), 
Goodhealth Jewelry, Longtan Tin Smelter (1,000-1,500 tons of 
fine tin per year as its scale), and Pangkham Peace Beer 
Factory. 
 
F.  Agriculture: We have invested more than (RMB)Y10 millions 
in agriculture sectors, constructed Mengkar conduit and 
Wanleng Dam as agricultural infrastructures, which can supply 
irrigation to 23,000 mu (1 acre=6.66 mu) of paddy rice fields 
 (However, because of insufficient funds, few paddy rice 
fields have actually been irrigated).  These agricultural 
projects have been funded by Wa State Government, not 
including local government\'s funds. Moreover, since the truce 
and entering peaceful construction period, each division, 
regiment of our troop can supply food for about 4 months by 
itself.  The real action of troop\'s taking part in 
agricultural and local construction encourage people\'s 
activities; as a result, people\'s income increased 30% on 
average. 
 
Alternative projects as follows: Wa State has developed 
rubber plantations on 53,660 mu, tea on 8,000 mu, various 
fruits on 6,600 acres and 160,000 teak trees.  It also 
developed a breeding industry, establishing a pig farm in 
Kyaing Teng and two chicken farms in Tachileik. 
 
Other alternative projects are under development. 
 
IV.  Drug control works 
 
The history of opium poppy growing in Wa region is more than 
a hundred years.  It is impossible to eradicate poppy growing 
in a short time.  Therefore, the Wa State Government made a 
plan in November 1990 to reduce the poppy growing area 
year-by-year, and to completely eliminate poppy growing 
within 10-15 years.\' 
 
In the past ten years, the Wa State Government has done a lot 
of propaganda about drug control among its cadres, solders 
and common people.  The intention of eliminating drugs in Wa 
State has been fully understood by every Wa person. 
 
In 1997, Wa State Government proclaimed the complete 
elimination of poppy growing in the whole Wa region by the 
end of 2005. 
 
In 1990, the estimated poppy growing area was 10,000 acres 
with total opium production of about 60 tons.  In 1994, the 
area was 8,000 acres and production was about 48 tons, and 
5,000 acres in 2000 with about 30 tons of total opium 
production. 
Wa State had destroyed great deal of drugs and processing 
mills in Namteng, Nawi, Hotao and Yawnting, etc, the value of 
drugs and equipment is more than a hundred million USD.

Classified By: DCM RONALD MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  International NGOs (INGOs) are working 
well in Kachin State.  Though few in number, they are 
providing urgently needed programs for HIV/AIDS, malaria, 
tuberculosis, and rural health care.  There are some types of 
aid programs, and geographic regions, that remain out of 
reach for the INGOs.  However, if the INGOs\' good relations 
with local officials persist, additional progress is likely. 
End summary. 
 
HIV/AIDS:  Good News and Bad News 
 
2. (SBU) INGOs in Kachin State (Burma\'s northernmost state, 
with a population of about 1.2 million) are focusing almost 
exclusively on health care -- testing, basic provision, and 
education.  On the HIV/AIDS front, there is some good and bad 
news.  On the positive side, the INGOs working most directly 
on HIV/AIDS agree that there is increasing acceptance and 
usage of condoms by sex workers.  Furthermore, pimps are in 
many cases now taking the side of the sex workers in trying 
to convince clients to use condoms. 
 
3. (SBU) Despite these positive indicators, INGOs report that 
sex workers are still willing to go without condoms if the 
money is better or if the sex worker \"like\" the client. 
Also, because of the combination locally of very high poverty 
and a small class of very wealthy Burmese and Chinese 
business people, the population of sex workers in Kachin 
State is growing as quickly as in Rangoon.  HIV infection 
rates are also very high among sex workers.  One INGO 
estimated a HIV infection rate of around 50 percent among a 
population of sex workers in a local disco. 
 
TB: Cases Up, But So Is Treatment 
 
4. (SBU) On the tuberculosis front, there also seems to be a 
mixed bag.  One INGO that is active with TB testing and 
treatment says that it is finding more cases of TB, but that 
more and more people are coming in for testing and treatment. 
 The problem of TB is compounded, INGOs agree, by the 
slumping economy as many people do not have enough to eat, 
and are thus more susceptible to TB (and other debilitating 
diseases) and slower to recover. 
 
Good Cooperation with the Authorities -- So Far 
 
5. (C) INGOs report that relations are good with local 
government authorities in Kachin State.  The local health 
director has given tacit permission for NGOs to provide 
services that the government is supposed to be providing, but 
does not (for example TB testing and treatment).  Usually, 
local health officials are frightened of taking any 
initiative to allow NGOs to provide any parallel services 
(even if the government in fact is not providing these 
services).  Relations are also good with the Northern 
Military Command\'s chief medical officer (who apparently 
speaks English quite well and is a fan of the BBC).  However, 
the military has not allowed INGOs access to the military 
hospital in town. 
 
6. (C) A true test of the local authorities\' willingness to 
let the INGOs provide essential services will come in the 
area of intravenous drug use (IDU) intervention.  This is a 
very sensitive proposition in Burma, with needle exchange and 
substitution programs still illegal.  In Kachin State, one 
INGO operates a very unofficial and subterranean needle 
exchange program in Mogaung (about 50 miles from Myitkyina), 
which relies on the local police turning a blind eye.  The 
INGO is trying to start a similar exchange program in 
Myitkyina, but is facing more police scrutiny.  There is 
clearly much potential, and need, for an expansion of harm 
reduction in the Myitkyina area, but there must be 
significant discussion beforehand with the various local 
authorities. 
 
Neediest are out of Reach 
 
7. (SBU) Despite the successes and access they have had, the 
INGOs agree that the remotest 25 percent of the state (along 
the border areas controlled by Kachin cease-fire groups) has 
the most urgent need for humanitarian assistance.  However, 
these regions are still mostly out of their reach.  Of the 
INGOs, World Concern seems to have the best access to the 
remoter areas.  However, funding problems have forced it to 
scale back its operations.  Some of Kachin State\'s indigenous 
NGOs may also be getting to these areas, but not to provide 
health care services.  There are also rumors that 
church-based NGOs operating in China,s Yunnan Province 
occasionally cross the border to provide some services (of an 
undetermined nature) in neighboring Kachin villages. 
Comment 
 
8. (SBU) Kachin State would be an excellent laboratory for 
any expansion of U.S. humanitarian aid programs -- especially 
for building the capacity of local NGOs.  The INGOs in place 
are well-established, have clear and reasonable objectives, 
and have good working relations with the necessary 
authorities (without relying upon them).  Likewise, the local 
NGOs in Kachin State, unlike their cousins in Rangoon, seem 
to be comparatively independent of government control and 
influence.  Part of this is certainly the result of the 
current personalities in key government positions in Kachin 
State.  Another important factor is the relative unity of the 
Kachin people, and their leaders\' so far successful balancing 
act of keeping good personal relations with the government, 
while retaining a relatively independent program of community 
development.  End comment.

1.  (C) Summary: At a press conference December 31, Aung San 
Suu Kyi continued to express \"cautious optimism\" about the 
possibility of political change in Burma in 2003, but 
complained about harassment during her recent trip to Rakhine 
State.  Post recommends that the Department support her 
comments with a statement that calls for change in Burma and 
for GOB action to protect the rights of political parties 
(see para 7 for suggested text of statement).  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) In a year-ending press conference held at the NLD\'s 
Shwegondine headquarters in Rangoon, Aung San Suu Kyi 
complained about USDA harassment during her recent trip to 
Rakhine State, but continued to express cautious optimism 
about the possibility for political change in Burma in 2003. 
Overall, she said, there had been some good developments in 
Burma in 2002, but not as much as the country demands.  Some 
political prisoners had been released, but the NLD\'s position 
remained that all should be released immediately, without 
pre-conditions.  Similarly, the NLD had been able to open 
some (about 90) of its 300 township offices, but had not been 
allowed to open all that it was ready to open.  At the 
insistence of the authorities, some openings had been 
delayed.  By and large, she said, her travels in Burma had 
also gone well, with the cooperation of the authorities. 
However, her recent trip to Rakhine State, in particular, had 
been marred by disturbances instigated by the USDA and other 
semi-official organs of the government. 
 
3. (U) ASSK also said that she had been encouraged by the 
spirit of the Burmese people, but \"saddened\" by the state of 
the nation.  She had found, she said, a great sense of 
\"national solidarity\" and a general awareness of the need for 
change.  However, there was also a great concern about the 
state of the economy and about the plight of farmers, who 
were now obliged to sell a portion of their crop to the 
government at below market prices.  The Burmese people, she 
said, deserved a better standard of living and a better 
governance.  Hopefully, they would get both in 2003. 
 
4. (U) In response to questions, she provided some details 
about the harassment she had endured during the trip to 
Rakhine State.  One government minister (reportedly the 
Minister of Tourism Thein Zaw) had gone ahead to Mrauk Oo and 
other cities and had urged the people not to turn out for the 
NLD leaders.  The USDA, the Myanmar Red Cross, and the War 
Veterans had then cooperated to block off streets in many 
towns.  Other members of the USDA had distributed leaflets 
questioning ASSK\'s patriotism and loyalty because of her 
marriage to a foreigner.  Together, these actions showed, 
ASSK said, how some elements in the government felt about her 
travels.  NLD Spokesman U Lwin had been told in Rangoon that 
none of the harassment had been ordered by the SPDC and, she 
said, she was prepared to accept that; however, the 
harassment had plainly been coordinated at some level 
(perhaps the state level), since the same events occurred 
again and again throughout the trip. 
 
5. (U) In regard to her talks with the government, ASSK 
insisted that there was no dialogue.  There also was no 
confidence-building -- that was over.  Relations with the 
government, she said, were now in a \"state of limbo.\"  She 
was prepared to join in a dialogue with the government at any 
time, with no preconditions.  However, it had to be a real 
dialogue, not a \"show-piece.\" 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C) This was ASSK\'s second press conference since she was 
released in May.  Her intent was plainly to call attention to 
the events in Rakhine State and to suggest that the 
government may not be sincere in its dealings with her. 
While she was careful not to accuse the SPDC itself for any 
wrongdoing during her trip to Rakhine State, she made it very 
clear that she held them responsible for the state of the 
nation and the delays in the start of \"real dialogue.\"  She 
was also plainly walking a fine line in all her comments -- 
never willing to actually breach whatever understandings she 
has with the government regarding political behavior, but, at 
the same time, making sure that everyone understood who the 
bad guys are in Burma. 
 
Action Recommended 
 
7. (C) Given ASSK\'s comments, post suggests that the 
Department make a statement of support for ASSK and the 
dialogue process.  The British Embassy has told us that they 
plan to recommend that their government (and the EU) also put 
out messages.  We leave it to the Department to work out the 
exact text (perhaps in coordination with the British), but 
something along the following lines might be appropriate. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
\"In a press conference in Rangoon on December 31, Aung San 
Suu Kyi described the harassment to which she was subjected 
during her recent trip to Burma\'s Rakhine State.  While it is 
not clear who is responsible for the actions of semi-official 
government organizations like the Union Solidarity 
Development Agency, the War Veteran\'s Organization, and the 
Myanmar Red Cross, it is clear that efforts by 
government-affiliated groups to harass opposition party 
leaders cannot help a national reconciliation process to 
which the Burmese government itself has committed itself. 
The United States calls on the Government of Burma to ensure 
that all political parties can carry their message to the 
Burmese people in safety.  We also call on the State Peace 
and Development Council to join with the NLD and 
representatives of Burma\'s ethnic communities in a real 
dialogue regarding constitutional issues.  Change is needed 
in Burma.  As Aung San Suu Kyi said December 31, the Burmese 
people deserve a better government and a better standard of 
living.  Every effort should be made to see that they get 
both in 2003.\"

SUBJECT: BURMESE FOREIGN MINISTER ON GOB COUNTERNARCOTICSS 
EFFORTS 
 
 
 1. (SBU) Summary:  Taking the opportunity of remarks before 
the assembled Rangoon diplomatic corps on New Year\'s Eve, the 
Burmese Foreign Minister digressed for ten minutes from his 
set speech to make very reasoned comments on the  GOB\'s 
desire to prove the credibility of its efforts against 
narcotrafficking.  Although he is not seen as a heavyweight 
in terms of power, he is known as being close to Senior 
General Than Shwe, reportedly because he never brings 
unpleasant news to the Senior General and always \"follows 
instructions\".  Therefore, the FonMin\'s message about the 
GOB\'s committment to counternarcotics efforts can be judged 
as having come from the top and is a surprising change from 
the GOB\'s usual tactic of \"deny, deny, counter-accuse\". End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) Taking the opportunity of a remarks before the 
assembled Rangoon diplomatic corps at noon on New Year\'s Eve, 
the Burmese Foreign Minister digressed for ten minutes from 
his set speech to comment on the  GOB\'s desire to prove the 
credibility of its efforts against narcotrafficking. 
Although some of the FonMin\'s stated goals may be 
unattainable ( i.e. reducing opium production in 2003 to 80 
per cent of the 2002 production), he sent a strong message 
that he would do everything in his power as Vice Chairman of 
the CCDAC  (Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control) to 
maintain momentum in the GOB\'s counternarcotics program. 
 
3. (U) He also called for regional assistance and cooperation 
with China, Thailand, Lao, Cambodia and India in combating 
ATS production, particularly with regards to controlling the 
flow of precursor chemicals.  The FonMin steered clear of the 
usual GOB tactic of claiming that Burma was the subject of a 
conspiracy or a smear campaign in regard to its 
counternarcotics efforts, saying instead that he was 
\"ashamed\" to see his country named in the international press 
as a major source of drugs. 
 
4. (U) The FonMin also called the situation of the farmers 
who are participating in opium substitution projects 
\"tragic\".  He said that the GOB knew it was the farmers that 
suffered the most and assured the audience that the GOB was 
sending additional food assistance to them to keep them from 
going back into opium production.  He said that the GOB was 
not asking for foreign assistance, but that direct foreign 
assistance to the farmers would be welcome.   He also 
mentioned the GOB\'s agreement with the Wa in which the Wa 
pledged to be out of opium production by 2005, saying 
\"pledges were no longer enough\", there had to be action and 
concrete proof that they were getting out of narcotrafficking 
 
5. (U) At the luncheon after the speech, the FonMin continued 
to talk about how intent the GOB and he, personally, was, to 
rid the country of opium production and of the importance of 
aiding farmers in crop substitution projects.  He asked the 
COM if the USG would provide assistance with crop yield 
surveys and satellite imaging to assist in eradication 
efforts (hopefully an indication that the next CNC survey 
will not be thrown off track by the probable of 
non-certification of Burma\'s counternarcotics efforts). 
 
6. (SBU) Comment:  The FonMin has a reputation for being 
non-controversial and it was highly uncharacteristic of  him 
to digress from the standard \"roads, bridges and visits\" 
speech to speak extemporaneously about the GOB\'s narcotics 
problem.  Although he is not seen as a heavyweight in terms 
of power, he is known as being close to Than Shwe, reportedly 
because he never brings unpleasant news to the Senior General 
and always \"follows instructions\".  Therefore, the FonMin\'s 
message about the GOB\'s commitment to counternarcotics 
efforts can be judged as having come from the top and is a 
surprising change from the GOB\'s usual tactic of \"deny, deny, 
counter-accuse\". End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S GARMENT INDUSTRY SEAMS DOOMED 
 
REF: 02 RANGOON 666 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  The threat of sanctions, the ongoing 
consumer boycott, and the GOB\'s own inane trade and 
investment policies are decimating the Burmese garment 
sector.  The upcoming elimination of textile quotas in 2005 
should put the final nail in the Burmese garment industry\'s 
coffin.  The regime gains little from the garment industry; 
trade sanctions now will only give the government cover for 
its own mistakes.  End summary. 
 
U.S. Taste for Burmese Garments Declines 
 
2. (SBU) U.S. imports of Burmese garments rose steadily 
through 2001 when they topped out at $415 million (about 80 
percent of Burma\'s total garment/textile exports).  However, 
thus far for 2002 the numbers tell a very different tale with 
U.S. garment imports off 30 percent year on year to about 
$250 million (through October 2002). 
 
3. (SBU) What gives?  The drop off, according to local 
industry sources, is due in part to consumer boycotts in the 
United States which have been steadily eroding demand for the 
\"Made in Myanmar\" label.  A second, related, reason is the 
looming threat that the U.S. Congress will impose textile 
sanctions. 
 
4. (SBU) However, there are also production problems here. 
Foreign investors (primarily from China, Taiwan, and South 
Korea) flocked to the Burmese garment sector in the 1990s 
seeking to take advantage of Burma\'s low cost and placid 
workforce, and the fact that, because of the small scale of 
the industry, most of Burma\'s textile products are allowed 
quota-free import to the United States (64 percent of Burma\'s 
garment exports in 2001 were non-quota items to the United 
States).  However, in 2002, the number of operational 
foreign-owned garment factories has plummeted as foreign 
investors and buyers grow increasingly reluctant to sign any 
long-term deals with Burmese factories because of sanction 
threats and consumer boycotts, and the impending expiration 
of the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA) on December 31, 2004. 
With quota considerations no longer constraining choices, 
most investors have quickly turned their backs on Burma.  A 
capricious and unfriendly business climate has also 
contributed to this exodus. 
 
Government Gains Minuscule, Workers Need Jobs 
 
5. (SBU) Though export numbers, and values, look high, in 
fact the regime earns very little.  We estimate that most 
garment manufacturers here, 95 percent of which are private, 
are paid only for \"cutting, manufacturing, and packaging\" 
(CMP) services generally worth about 20 percent of each 
shipment.  The GOB then takes about 10 percent of the 20 
percent in taxes, as well as some income from the small 
number of government-owned and joint venture garment 
factories.  Overall, on $200 million in exports to the United 
States, the government might earn $5 million at most. 
 
6. (SBU) The industry does benefit Burmese workers.  In this 
perilous economic period of high inflation and unemployment, 
the industry supports an estimated 100,000 unskilled workers 
(who in turn support an estimated 400,000 family members). 
Though wages are low on a global scale, they are average to 
above average for Burma -- and often include some minimal 
health and insurance benefits. 
 
Prospects are Bleak 
 
7. (SBU) Burmese industry sources tell us that the drop off 
of exports to the United States will not likely be replaced 
by sales elsewhere.  Currently, there is no other country or 
region that comes close to U.S. consumption of Burmese 
textile exports.  Though EU markets may pick up some of the 
slack, the same consumer boycotts that make exporters wary of 
the United States are also active there.  More importantly, 
the MFA is a global agreement which will be phased out in 
Europe as well as the United States after 2005. 
 
8. (SBU) In short, garments are a dying industry in Burma. 
It flourished in the context of quota arrangements, which, 
for a brief period, overshadowed an atrocious trading and 
investment climate.  With these quotas now being phased out, 
manufacturers are wisely moving elsewhere. 
 
Comment 
9. (SBU) In that context, it is really hard to say what 
impact even a total ban on trade with the United States would 
have on Burmese garment exports.  Such a ban might accelerate 
the decline of the industry, but it will also give the GOB 
political cover for short-sighted economic and industrial 
policies that have scared away investment.  They will make 
for great political theater (both in the United States and 
here), but their real impact on economic life here and on the 
regime will be close to negligible.  The only ones who will 
really suffer will be those workers who lose their jobs one 
year early.  And they, unfortunately, will tend to blame the 
United States rather than their own government.  That however 
is one of the penalties for imposing sanctions on a dying 
industry.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S INDEPENDENCE DAY; THE NLD CALLS FOR 
DIALOGUE; THE GOB FOR DISCIPLINE 
 
REF: 02 RANGOON 1663 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen M. Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s January 4 Independence Day 
celebrations produced no new gestures of reconciliation and 
perhaps a slight hardening of positions on both sides.  The 
National League for Democracy called for an end to political 
oppression, the release of all political prisoners, and the 
initiation of a \"real\" political dialogue on constitutional 
issues.  It also indicated that there was no room for any 
reciprocal, confidence-building gestures from the NLD until a 
real political dialogue was started.  The government rejected 
international criticism of the harassment to which Aung San 
Suu Kyi had been subjected in Rakhine State and called on all 
parties to \"play by the prevailing rules and regulations.\" 
It also focused its Independence Day speeches almost 
exclusively on history and the economy, saying nothing at all 
about political transition.  End Summary. 
 
NLD Celebration 
 
2. (U) The NLD celebration took place as usual before a crowd 
of about 500, including ethnic representatives (mostly 
members of the Committee to Represent the People\'s 
Parliament), diplomats from most Western embassies and Japan, 
and representatives of the UN agencies.  The highlight was 
the presentation of a new party resolution which reaffirmed 
the party\'s willingness to work cooperatively with the 
military on political transition, but which also condemned 
the continuing political oppression in Burma and called for 
the start of a \"real dialogue\" on constitutional issues. 
Until that dialogue started, the resolution said, the party 
would stand by its current positions.  It would demand that 
the results of the 1990 election be implemented and would 
refuse to attend the National Convention convened by the SPDC 
to draft a new constitution.  It would also continue to hold 
to its current position on aid: aid should be granted to 
Burma only for humanitarian purposes and then only under 
conditions that would ensure that it was \"transparent, 
accountable, and independently monitored.\"  In her oral 
remarks, ASSK added a call for selfless dedication to the 
party.  If the party was rent by the pursuit of individual 
ambition, it would inevitably dissolve. 
 
The GOB Celebrations 
 
3. (U) The GOB itself had nothing to say about democracy or 
political transition in any of its official Independence Day 
messages.  Delivered before the usual crowds of thousands, 
those speeches focused almost exclusively on history and the 
economy, and the current need for austerity.  There was not a 
word about democracy or political transition.  Moreover, in a 
statement released that same day, the GOB rejected 
international criticism of the harassment the NLD encountered 
in Rakhine State (reftel) and called on all political parties 
\"to play by the rules and regulations of the political game.\" 
 The local authorities in Rakhine State, the GOB said, were 
only applying the law and, in particular, the current ban on 
all outdoor political rallies. 
 
Other Groups 
 
4. (U) Two other groups also chimed in with political 
statements.  U Tha Gyaw, the Chairman of the National Unity 
Party, which is basically the reincarnation of Ne Win\'s old 
Burma Socialist Program Party, called for a multiparty 
democracy.  Similarly, at an event attended by ASSK and other 
NLD leaders, the Veteran Politicians Group (basically General 
Aung San and Ne Win\'s contemporaries) called for the SPDC and 
the NLD to start \"a meaningful political dialogue at the 
earliest possible moment.\" 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C) Independence Day may not have produced any progress on 
political transition, but it at least produced some clarity 
regarding both sides\' positions.  ASSK has been saying for 
some time that the period of confidence-building is over. 
From the party\'s Independence Day resolution, it is now clear 
what she means by that: until a \"real dialogue\" has begun, 
there is no room for reciprocal gestures by the NLD (e.g. 
calling for additional aid or any easing of sanctions). 
Evidently, the NLD has come to the decision that it has few 
cards to play and cannot play any of those cards prematurely. 
 Once there is a real prospect for change; i.e., some real 
dialogue with the government, then the NLD can call for some 
relaxation of the current pressure.  Until that point is 
reached, however, the party (or at least ASSK) now apparently 
believes that the best counsel is simply to hold firm. 
 
6. (C) The GOB meanwhile has laid down some markers of its 
own, cautioning the NLD not to abuse the political freedoms 
it\'s been given.  The \"evolving political transition in 
Myanmar will continue unabated, provided that political 
parties also play by the prevailing rules and regulations of 
the political game.\"  The hint is that the government will 
react firmly to any efforts to provoke unrest or 
confrontation. 
7. (C) Finally, the positions of the NUP and the veteran 
politicians are both interesting.  The NUP has always been 
one of the props of the regime.  That it is now choosing to 
come down publicly in favor of multiparty democracy is a 
strong indication of the direction in which it sees the 
political winds blowing.  Similarly, the Veteran Politicians 
Group has long called for dialogue.  This is the first time, 
however, that it has issued that call in company with the NLD 
and Aung San Suu Kyi.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: UPDATE ON WWII REMAINS RECOVERY IN BURMA 
 
Classified By: CHIEF OF MISSION CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.5 (D) 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  The recovery of the remains of some 600 
WWII missing personnel (mostly crews of aircraft that crashed 
while flying \"the hump\" from India to China) is an important 
USG priority in Burma.  With fairly good cooperation from the 
Government of Burma, the recovery operation is moving ahead 
more or less on schedule.  The limited availability of 
helicopters this dry season is a major obstacle and has 
probably reduced significantly the operation\'s chances of 
dramatic success in the initial phases.  There are many 
policy and public diplomacy minefields that Post will try to 
help the operation avoid while working in this sensitive 
area.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) PROGRESS TO DATE:  Following the September 2002 
framework agreement reached between visiting DASD Jennings 
and S1 General Khin Nyunt, three Burmese officials traveled 
to the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii 
(CILHI) for a familiarization visit.  A well-attended Joint 
Planning Meeting held in Rangoon in October ironed out many 
technical details of the operation.  The U.S. side included 
CILHI, DoD\'s Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office 
(DPMO), and Embassy Rangoon -- both State and DAO.  A health 
and logistics advance team visited Burma in December to 
establish medevac and other logistical procedures.  The team 
to scout out potential recovery sites, the Investigative 
Element (IE), is scheduled to arrive in Rangoon January 12. 
 
3.  (SBU) THE IMPORTANCE OF HELICOPTERS:  Most of the 
probable crash sites are located in Kachin State in the far 
north of Burma.  Dense jungles, high mountains (up to 19,000 
ft.), and poor roads make travel by land difficult. 
Poisonous snakes, bandits, drug traffickers, thousands of 
armed members of the Kachin Independence Army, and rugged 
terrain make off-road travel in this area difficult. 
Helicopter medevac capability would be important for any 
sustained trek to a crash site by a recovery team.  Normally 
both the scouting team, the IE, and the actual recovery team 
(the Recovery Element, RE) would use helicopters extensively. 
 
 
4.  (C) THE LACK OF HELICOPTERS:  The Burmese air force has a 
fleet of Soviet-era helicopters and a small number of 
helicopters given by the USG to the GOB two decades ago for 
drug eradication purposes.  Given maintenance and repair 
practices, the reliability of these aircraft is unknown. 
Further, during the October technical talks the Burmese air 
force\'s opening rental price was $16,000 per blade hour, 
which they quickly dropped to $8,000/hr. after the loud, 
unison guffaw from the U.S. side.  This is still two to three 
times the going commercial rate.  Rather than be fleeced to 
rent helicopters of uncertain reliability, the COM and DATT 
strongly recommended that commercial helicopters be used to 
augment GOB helicopters in the recovery efforts. 
Unfortunately, it appears that the DoD-certified helicopter 
lease companies in the region are booked up until mid to late 
February.  This means the January IE will be restricted to 
land transport. 
 
5.  (C) LIMITATIONS OF A LAND-BASED IE:  Locating and 
excavating promising recovery sites is no mean feat. 
Normally an IE would helicopter to a potential site 
identified by a combination of aerial reconnaissance and 
local human information.  If the site looked promising to the 
IE after its helicopter-borne visit, a landing zone would be 
cut and larger helicopters would ferry in the RE to work the 
site.  If the January IE were restricted to Kachin State\'s 
road network, a general impression of the topography of the 
possible crash site would be about all an IE could glean in 
the field.  The IE also will interview inhabitants who claim 
to know of crash sites.  It seems likely that CILHI will need 
to conduct further investigations in late February just prior 
to the beginning of the recovery effort when commercial 
helicopters are available.  This compressed and restricted 
scouting phase will make it more difficult, but not 
impossible, to achieve a major recovery success this year. 
 
6.  (C) POLITICS, SENSITIVITIES, AND PUBLIC DIPLOMACY:  Post 
is keenly aware of the sensitivities of working (on any 
issue) in Burma.  The remains recovery operation in Kachin 
State is a particularly complex, sensitive, and difficult 
case. 
 
--  The 1.2 million Kachin have a particular affinity for 
Americans; over 10,000 fought alongside U.S. troops in WWII 
and U.S. Baptist missionaries have converted many Kachin to 
Christianity.  A long-running Kachin separatist movement, 
spearheaded by the 20,000-strong Kachin Independence Army, 
has signed a cease-fire with Rangoon\'s military government 
but retains its weapons and controls much of Kachin State. 
As one observer bluntly put it, \"Kachins like Americans but 
distrust (ethnic) Burmese.\"  The investigative and recovery 
teams will likely pass back and forth between territory 
controlled by Burmese soldiers and armed KIA members. 
Interviewing Kachins who claim knowledge of crash sites in 
front of ethnic Burmese members of Military Intelligence also 
poses some challenges. 
 
-- While S1 General Khin Nyunt, who heads Burma\'s military 
intelligence, is the point man for the GOB on the recovery 
efforts, it will be the regional military commander in Kachin 
State (who doesn\'t report to Khin Nyunt) who controls the 
military resources on the ground.  Just as there appeared to 
be a different approach on helicopter rental between MI and 
the Burmese air force, we could possibly see independent 
action in Kachin State not in keeping with the outline agreed 
to with MI.  However, the DATT held coordination discussions 
27 DEC 02 with military commander Maung Aye and S1 Khin Nyunt 
to help head off any such difficulties. 
 
-- Post personnel are aware of standard procedures routinely 
employed by MI in Burma.  For example, MI apparently 
attempted to dragoon an English-speaking local to translate 
for the December logistics visit.  A member of the DAO took 
note, and asked that the man be released from his translating 
duties, which he was.  This same officer saw MI brusquely 
interrogating a Kachin interlocutor just after his discussion 
with the American.  The officer approached his MI minders and 
told them to stop harassing the man, which they did.  Post, 
DPMO, and CILHI have discussed in detail with the GOB the 
serious negative ramifications of any forced labor or forced 
contributions being used to support this project.  The main 
concern is that some local Burmese commander might not get 
the word from on high. 
 
7.  (C) COMMENT:  We are optimistic that the remains recovery 
effort will be successful.  It is important that the Embassy 
- State and DAO - play an active leading role in the 
operation to help avoid potential local pitfalls.   Perhaps 
the most promising sites (some of which are extremely remote) 
can only be investigated and excavated next dry season, after 
thorough analysis of local knowledge and a 
helicopter-assisted IE.  Nevertheless, the recovery of even a 
few remains this year is important, both in itself and to 
establish procedures for an ongoing recovery effort.  End 
Comment.

1. (SBU) Summary:  The surprisingly large informal banking 
sector in Burma has become a major cause of inflation, and a 
threat to the stability of the already weakened Burmese 
economy.  A crackdown combined with a general liberalization 
of the official banking sector would be the best course for 
the GOB and Burma\'s economy.  Unfortunately, given the 
regime\'s economic track record, that is probably the least 
likely scenario of all.  End summary. 
 
Gold Bars and Monks\' Robes 
 
2. (SBU) There is evidence that the regime is pondering 
clamping down on Burma\'s legally murky, but nonetheless 
booming, informal finance sector.  This past Fall, 
authorities gave the order to shut down two of the roughly 20 
extant non-bank financial institutions on charges that the 
firms\' management was involved in embezzlement and egregious 
corruption.  (One was caught at the airport trying to flee 
with a suitcase stuffed with dollars, the other was arrested 
for secretly casting gold bars.)  The government has ordered 
the two companies to repay all depositors, but this seems 
unlikely in the short run.  The larger of the two outfits has 
said nothing will be forthcoming before May.  Even if 
repayments do eventually occur, they will likely be pyas on 
the kyat. 
 
3. (SBU) The informal banking sector in Burma found its niche 
due to the ineffectual and overregulated private banking 
sector and the average Burmese person\'s mistrust of banks 
under government scrutiny.  Taking advantage of loopholes in 
the law, nascent entrepreneurs (and con men) began to take 
deposits or investments and to establish non-bank finance 
companies under the Cooperatives Law or the Myanmar Company 
Act.  The attraction was the lack of regulation.  Neither 
cooperatives nor companies, are supervised by the Ministry of 
Finance and Central Bank or subject to normal banking 
regulations.  Hence, for these institutions at least, there 
were no reserve or liquidity requirements, nor any 
restriction on lending or borrowing rates. 
 
4. (SBU) Some of these institutions outright offer interest 
rates 5 or 6 times the legal deposit rate (e.g., as high as 
50 or 60 percent per annum); others offer the same 
enticement, but insist that depositors are buying \"shares\" in 
the institution (and its underlying real estate and other 
commercial investments) that happen to pay out a 60 percent 
rate of return.  However, despite the rhetoric, none of these 
venture capital outfits are public firms, and none are 
scrutinized by the government or a board of directors. 
 
5. (SBU) These institutions generally take the money that is 
deposited and immediately invest it, usually in some private 
venture benefiting the banks\' ownership.  Often the funds go 
into rapidly appreciating assets, such as real estate, 
automobiles, gold, and gems.  However, much investment has 
also found its way into the industrial sector, funding 
ventures in everything from seafood exporting to the 
production of monks\' robes.  The danger to consumers is that 
very few of these banks actually keep cash on hand.  As a 
result, whenever the underlying investments go bad, there is 
a risk that either the institutions will go bust or that 
promised interest rates or returns on investment will funded 
by new deposits -- a classic pyramid scheme. 
 
A Hidden Giant 
 
6. (SBU) Because of total absence of data, financial experts 
here are reluctant to estimate the number of depositors or 
the value of deposits now lodged with these unofficial 
financial institutions.  However, they agree that the sector 
is booming and that both are likely quite high.  One private 
banker said he would not be surprised if \"non-bank financial 
institutions\" had as much as 250 billion kyat (about half 
what is held in the official banking sector) sloshing through 
them.  These same experts said these institutions might have 
between 100,000 and 200,000 depositors -- including small 
savers, business people, and military officers. 
 
7. (SBU) Even if the deposits are only half this estimate, 
they represent a massive amount of unsupervised, \"illegal\" 
funds that could well be a major source of the excess money 
supply and speculative investment that are driving up 
inflation here.  Last year, consumer price inflation in the 
Rangoon area was about 60 percent, with prices of assets such 
as real estate and automobiles rising even higher.  The fact 
that thousands of depositors, many of them quite small time, 
have their money in these schemes also raises the specter of 
serious political and economic turmoil should these 
institutions suddenly collapse. 
 
Government Crackdown: Stop or We\'ll Say Stop Again 
 
8. (SBU) The informal banking sector is basically a time bomb 
waiting to go off.  Left alone, it will inevitably crash, 
potentially bringing down asset markets with them. 
Consequently, there is no question but that the government 
should take action against these firms simply in the interest 
of stability.  However such actions have downsides.  For one, 
several banking experts have told us that high-level military 
officials are shareholders or major depositors in these 
institutions.  Second, at this sensitive time, the GOB won\'t 
likely risk the political discontent that could come from 
essentially ruining thousands of small depositors who have 
deposited billions of kyats in these institutions.  Third, 
too-rapid government seizure and auctioning of these 
companies\' assets (to repay depositors) could also place 
significant deflationary pressures on asset prices.  This 
could then undermine the portfolios of legitimate banks and 
cause a serious banking crisis (see reftel). 
 
Comment 
 
9. (SBU) Despite the risks, it is in the GOB\'s best interest 
to shut down this dangerous network.  If it does, the 
question is whether it will do so intelligently, by 
instituting real banking reform alongside a slow but steady 
crackdown on these shadow banks, or not.  If legitimate 
private banks could set their own deposit and lending rates, 
under the supervision of the Central Bank and the Ministry of 
Finance, they could attract many small depositors who are now 
forced to look to the black market for some real return that 
competes with inflation.  Funds would move from relatively 
high-risk to relatively low-risk institutions, banks would 
get the funding and liquidity they now badly need, and asset 
market prices would remain basically stable.  That sort of 
intelligent liberalization, however, is probably the least 
likely scenario.  If the past is prologue, the GOB will 
either let the current bubble build, while doing nothing, or 
crack down hard with no accompanying banking reforms.  In 
either case, the economy (and Burma\'s small depositors) will 
pay the price, either now or later.  End comment.

SUBJECT: END GAME IN BURMA\'S ETHNIC WARS 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Burma has basically won its ethnic wars. 
While some small-scale operations continue, the situation now 
is nothing like it was in the late 1980s.  Then, 20 separate 
insurgent groups could put more than 60,000 troops in the 
field in Burma.  Now, the five or six groups that remain 
active can muster at most 5,000 troops.  All, moreover, have 
been reduced to guerrilla operations; none are any longer 
capable of holding territory in Burma. 
 
2. (C) Behind these developments lie an integrated GOB 
political, military, economic, and diplomatic strategy that, 
in many ways, was the exact opposite of Ne Win\'s approach. 
Led by Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, the GOB has mixed political 
negotiations with military force, economic inducements, and 
diplomatic initiatives to isolate, defeat, co-opt, and slowly 
re-integrate its armed opponents within the Burmese Union. 
The entire 14-year campaign is an excellent example of the 
political skills the SPDC can display when issues of high 
interest to them are at stake. 
 
3. (C) Problems remain, however.  It is still not clear how 
the government plans to integrate these former insurgent 
groups and their special regions into an enduring 
constitutional order.  International appreciation of the 
government\'s victory has also been strictly limited. 
Regional states like China, India, and Thailand have accepted 
the GOB\'s victory.  In the West, however, the view is 
decidedly more negative.  While some Western governments have 
welcomed the re-establishment of order in areas previously 
governed by criminal elements, for most, the allegations of 
human rights abuses that accompanied the GOB\'s campaign have 
only solidified their view of the GOB as a brutal 
dictatorship.  Finally, but perhaps most seriously, there is 
no guarantee that the government\'s work will last.  For 
whatever success the GOB has had in ending the ethnic wars 
and reconstructing the Union of Burma, it has failed 
miserably as a government -- to the point of never even 
laying a secure fiscal basis for continued rule.  If that is 
not corrected, then all of the GOB\'s work in reconstructing 
the Union, through war, diplomacy, and political 
negotiations, could well be washed away.  End Summary. 
 
4. (C) For all intents and purposes, the GOB has won its 
ethnic wars.  While low intensity operations continue on both 
the eastern and western borders, the situation now is nowhere 
near what it was when the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (SLORC) seized power in 1988.  Then, the GOB was 
faced with over 20 active insurgent groups capable of putting 
a combined total of over 60,000 soldiers in the field.  The 
Kachin Independence Organization controlled the largest 
portion of Kachin State; the Burmese Communist Party held 
most of northern Shan State east of the Salween river; Khun 
Sa\'s Mong Tai Army was ensconced in southern and western Shan 
State; and the Karen National Union held broad swathes of 
Karen State.  Now, virtually none of this remains.  The only 
armed opposition still in the field -- the Karen National 
Union (KNU), the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP), 
the Shan State Army (South), the Chin National Front (CNF), 
and the Arakan Rohingya National Organization (ARNO) -- taken 
altogether, can perhaps put 5,000 troops in the field.  All, 
moreover, have largely been reduced to guerrilla operations. 
None are capable any longer of holding territory in Burma. 
 
National Defense and Counter-insurgency Strategy 
 
5. (C) Behind this change lies an integrated GOB political, 
military, and economic strategy that has matured as the GOB 
has moved away from the simple-minded defense strategies of 
the Ne Win and U Nu years.  Ne Win basically believed that 
the greatest threats to Burma would arise from its nearest 
neighbors (China, India, and Thailand) and that its greatest 
strength lay in its natural defenses -- the mountains and 
forests that surround the Burman heartland.  Burma, he 
believed, could rely on natural obstacles to hold up any 
attacker and on a lightly armed people\'s army to cut the 
enemy to pieces in the forests.  It became, as a consequence, 
policy under both the U Nu and Ne Win governments to leave 
the wilderness areas intact -- in effect, to sacrifice the 
development of those border areas to Burma\'s national defense 
priorities. 
 
6. (C) That approach, however, had disastrous side-effects, 
providing both the motive and the opportunity for ethnic 
rebellions.  It antagonized the ethnic inhabitants of the 
outlying regions, who found themselves cut off from any hope 
of development.  It also limited the government\'s writ in 
those areas, as the wilderness that the Burmese created 
proved equally impenetrable from the Burmese side.  The 
Burmese Army could mount dry season sweeps through these 
regions, but it could not maintain a presence in the face of 
popular resistance.  As a result, the GOB rapidly found 
itself surrounded not by buffers to invasion, but by 
safe-havens from which bandits and insurgents could operate 
with impunity.  Law and order broke down and ethnic 
insurgencies spread to the point where, by the mid-1980s, 
virtually all of Burma\'s inland borders were in the hands of 
insurgents. 
 
The Turning Point 
 
7. (C) Fortunately for the government, the insurgents had 
their own problems.  Factionalism was rife and foreign 
support uncertain.  China, in particular, backed off from 
support of the Burmese Communist Party (BCP) after the rise 
of Deng Xiao Ping in the late 1970s.  Thailand, similarly, 
swung back and forth between support for ethnic rights in 
Burma and concern about the refugee, crime, and public health 
problems generated by the insurgencies in Burma.  As a 
result, neither the GOB nor the insurgents could gain the 
upper hand until events brought in new leadership, both in 
Rangoon and among the major insurgents during the late 1980s. 
 In Rangoon, the military established a new military council 
(the State Law and Order Restoration Council) in place of Ne 
Win\'s failed dictatorship.  Six months later (in March and 
April 1989) a series of mutinies tore the BCP into a set of 
smaller ethnic armies whose first priority was not national 
revolution, but peace and development for their own regions. 
 
8. (C) Recognizing the opportunity (and the necessity for 
change), the GOB, led by Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, basically 
turned government policy on its head.  Within months, the GOB 
negotiated  political agreements with four factions of the 
BCP -- the Kokang Chinese under Peng Kya Shin, the Wa under 
Kyauk Ni Lai and Pauk Yu Chan, the Shan, Akha, and Lahu under 
Sai Lin, and the BCP\'s Kachin under Ting Ling.  Active 
hostilities were brought to a close, while the former 
insurgents were allowed to keep their arms and to administer 
the territories they occupied.  Khin Nyunt described the 
approach as giving the ethnic groups what they wanted -- 
peace and an opportunity for development.  The final 
agreements, however, also solidified splits among the ethnic 
factions and helped ensure that the GOB would never again 
have to face the combined strength of the BCP in the field. 
 
9. (C) Over the next half-decade, the GOB offered the same 
basic political deal to all other insurgent groups.  It also 
added military, economic, and diplomatic elements to its 
strategy.  On the military side, the Burmese Army ditched the 
idea of fighting a \"people\'s war\" -- a doctrine which had 
kept its own lightly armed forces on a par with the 
insurgents -- and began to add manpower, heavy weapons, and a 
logistic tail that would allow it to sustain operations 
year-round in insurgent areas.  It also concentrated against 
the most recalcitrant groups -- the KNU and Khun Sa\'s Mong 
Tai Army -- eventually forcing the Mong Tai Army into 
surrender and the KNU out of Burma entirely.  On the economic 
side, it sweetened the deal.  Originally, the GOB offered the 
former insurgents only control of the economic resources 
within the territories they administered.  Basically, this 
amounted to border trade, logging and mineral rights, and the 
illicit traffic in narcotics.  Beginning in 1990, however, 
the GOB added a borderlands development program, which has 
since contributed more than 20 billion kyat (according to 
government figures) to development in areas controlled by the 
former insurgents.  It also passed out mineral rights within 
Burma proper and opened up the Burmese economy to investments 
by the insurgent groups, allowing the Wa, for instance, to 
make investments in banks, airlines, plantations, ranches, 
and factories throughout Burma.  While this has been 
controversial, with many Burmese accusing the government of 
selling off the economy\'s crown jewels to criminal elements, 
it has also given the former insurgents a stake in the Union 
and opened development opportunities for them that go beyond 
crime. 
 
10. (C) This promise of peace, development, and self-rule, 
when combined with the threat of increased military action 
and the lure of economic benefits, proved irresistible to 
most insurgent groups.  Between 1990 and 1995, seventeen 
separate groups reached agreements with the government, 
including the Kachin Independence Organization, the Kayan New 
Land Party, the New Mon State Party, the Pa\'O National 
Organization, the Palaung State Liberation Party, and a 
variety of other smaller groups.  One year later, the Mong 
Tai Army surrendered, leaving the KNU as the only significant 
insurgent group still in the field.  Even the KNU, however, 
was only a shadow of its former self.  Split into two rival 
religious factions (the KNU proper and the Democratic Karen 
Buddhist Army, which has since allied itself with the GOB), 
the KNU has not been able to carry out any significant 
military operations in Burma since 1996. 
 
Finishing the Job 
 
11. (C) Since then, the GOB has focused on reducing the 
remaining centers of resistance and re-incorporating the 
former insurgent territories within the Burmese Union. 
Neither problem has been solved, but the outlines of the 
government\'s plans are clear.  In the case of the remaining 
active insurgencies, the GOB will continue to combine offers 
of negotiation with military and diplomatic pressure.  For 
the KNU, the KNPP, and other groups that the GOB recognizes 
as legitimate representatives of national races in Burma, the 
GOB has basically left the terms of the 1988-95 agreements on 
the table.  As then, it is prepared to offer peace, amnesty, 
self-administered areas, and the right to keep their arms and 
private armies in return for pledges of loyalty to the Union 
and a renunciation of armed struggle.  In contrast, it has 
offered the Shan State Army-South only the surrender terms 
originally accepted in 1996 by their original leader, Khun 
Sa, and his Mong Tai Army. 
 
12. (C) Meanwhile, the GOB has maintained the military 
pressure on these armed groups, extending its operations 
right up to the Thai border, while relocating villages in 
Shan, Karen, and Kayah States on which the Shan State Army 
(South), the KNU, and the KNPP depend for support and 
shelter.  For the insurgents, the effect of these operations 
has been devastating.  Without the protection of a sheltering 
population and faced with a serious enemy, most have 
abandoned significant military operations.  The SSA now 
almost never operates anywhere outside the range of covering 
fire from Thai guns, while the KNU and KNPP have slowly 
drifted towards banditry. 
 
13. (C) Finally, on the diplomatic front, the GOB has taken 
advantage of Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra\'s 
interest in stability, legality, and economic development in 
northeast Thailand, and in securing Burmese cooperation in 
pursuing those aims, to reduce Thai support for insurgent 
groups.  This effort came to a head during the summer of 
2002, following clashes on the Thai/Burmese border.  Since 
then, it has become increasingly clear that the days of 
launching insurgent attacks on Burma from Thai soil may 
finally be over.  The remaining Burmese insurgent groups in 
Thailand may be able to continue their political activities; 
cross-border military action, however, will likely become 
increasingly difficult. 
 
14. (C) This new Thai government approach has, in turn, put 
the insurgents in a difficult position, forcing many to 
seriously consider negotiations.  The KNPP, in fact, has 
already split, with one fairly large group under Richard Htoo 
having accepted the government\'s terms -- essentially 
resuming the cease-fire agreement originally negotiated in 
1995.  The KNU is also deep in negotiations with the GOB, 
although it remains to be seen whether KNU strongman Bo Mya 
will ever be able to bring himself to accept a cease-fire. 
Even the SSA has asked for terms, though the difference 
between what they are asking for (essentially autonomy within 
their own self-administered region) and what the government 
will give (basically an amnesty plus a new start in life for 
individuals) is huge. 
 
Re-integration 
15. (C) The GOB has coupled its continuing counter-insurgency 
operations with efforts to re-incorporate former insurgents 
in the Union.  Its approach has basically been to maintain 
the spirit of the original cease-fire agreements -- at least 
while the GOB was negotiating similar agreements with others 
-- but to make clear that 1) everything depends on the 
capacity of the former insurgent groups to maintain order in 
their territories and 2) that nothing in those agreements 
gives anyone the right to violate the law, or ignore other 
political and administrative arrangements prevailing in the 
Union.  The Kokang Chinese, in particular, have felt the bite 
of the first condition.  When a coup by the Yang family (the 
traditional rulers of the Kokang) and a counter-coup by Peng 
Kya Shin split the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army 
in to three separate groups during the mid-1990s, the GOB 
picked a favorite (Peng Kya Shin) and moved in to 
re-establish a Burmese Army presence (and now dominance) in 
the previously sacrosanct cease-fire area.  Similarly, when a 
mutiny split Mon Sa La\'s Mong Ko Defense Army in 2000, the 
Burmese Army moved in, occupied Mong Ko and wiped both 
competing bands off the map. 
 
16. (U) The GOB has also slowly extended its administrative 
reach into the former insurgent territories through subsidies 
and aid programs, the re-establishment of education and 
health services, and introduction of Burmese police and 
military operations.  In 2001, for the first time, the GOB 
established a Burmese police presence in the Wa territories 
and a Burmese military intelligence office in the Wa capital 
of Pang Sang.  Requests for permission for government visits 
to cease-fire areas or Burmese military transit through these 
areas have also become largely perfunctory.  Where once it 
really did ask permission, the GOB now merely notifies the 
cease-fire groups that it is coming, and then goes, 
regardless of whether it receives an answer or not. 
 
17. (C) On the legal front, the GOB has conditioned its 
support for former insurgent groups on pledges by the groups 
to make their regions opium-free.  Sai Lin of Shan State 
Special region No. 2 around Mong La pledged to make his 
region opium-free by 1997, and has apparently done so, albeit 
while building Mong La into a flourishing center for gambling 
and prostitution.  Peng Kya Shin of the Kokang Chinese, 
similarly, pledged to be out of opium by 2000, but failed, 
and is now paying the price for that failure through an 
extended joint Burmese/Chinese police crackdown on Kokang 
narcotics operations.  As for the Wa, they are due to be out 
of opium by 2005 and are apparently on track. 
 
18. (C) Finally, by some well-managed diplomacy, the GOB has 
earned China\'s support for both its law enforcement and its 
political efforts.  Aroused by the growth of narcotics 
trafficking from Burma into and through Yunnan Province, 
China has changed from the historic ally of the BCP remnants 
that now form many of these cease-fire groups into one of 
their most resolute opponents, regularly demanding (and 
getting) cease-fire group cooperation in the suppression of 
narcotics production and trafficking all along its border 
with Burma.  As nothing else could, these aggressive Chinese 
law enforcement operations have illustrated for the 
cease-fire groups the potential political consequences of 
continued involvement with narcotics.  In simplest terms, the 
Chinese and the Burmese together have made it known that 
these  groups have no political future, if they stay with 
drugs. 
 
Conclusions 
 
19. (C) A few basic points stand out from this history. 
First, Burma\'s ethnic wars are all but over.  While a few 
peace agreements have yet to be negotiated, all of those that 
matter (with the KNU, the KNPP, and the SSA) could be 
completed within the next few months, i.e., by the close of 
the coming dry season. 
 
20. (C) Secondly, the SPDC is anything but a simple extension 
of Ne Win\'s previous dictatorship, at least in its dealings 
with the ethnic insurgents.  Where Ne Win was content to 
neglect and exploit the border areas for the sake of security 
in the Burman heartland, the SPDC has made defense of the 
Union -- the entire Union -- a national priority.  That 
approach has had its own consequences for ethnic minorities 
-- the wars the SPDC has waged in the ethnic areas have been 
real wars, not the trivial sweeps once orchestrated by Ne 
Win.  However, the peace, autonomy, and opportunity for 
development that the SPDC has offered these groups have been 
equally real.  There has been no false dealing, a la Ne Win. 
 
21. (C) Thirdly, the political skills the SPDC has 
demonstrated in dealing with these insurgencies belies their 
image in the West as political buffoons.  While the SPDC has 
generally responded ineptly when asked to perform in 
accordance with the Western agenda on political and economic 
liberalization, on issues of vital concern to themselves 
(like these internal wars), they have acted with skills that 
many other states (think of Russia with the Chechens) can 
only envy.  The difference is in part a matter of priorities. 
 For the GOB, issues affecting the integrity of the union 
come first; nothing else really gets as much high-level 
attention. 
 
22. (C) That said, it is also worth noting that whatever 
success the GOB has had in dealing with the insurgencies, 
there are still major unresolved problems.  To start with, it 
is still not clear how the government plans to integrate ad 
hoc structures like the special regions into an enduring 
constitutional order.  While it has been willing to allow the 
cease-fire group leaders a voice in Burma\'s constitutional 
debates, inviting several to its now suspended National 
Conference, there is a large group of Burmans (and Burmese 
Army officers), who would just as soon see these groups and 
their special regions disappear entirely.  For the 
government, keeping faith with the cease-fire leaders while 
responding to the interests of these other influential groups 
will be a challenge. 
 
23. (C) There has also been little international recognition 
of the government\'s victory.  Regional states, such as 
Thailand, China, and India, which were the countries most 
affected by Burma\'s ethnic wars, have generally accepted the 
GOB\'s success. In their view, the resulting stability was 
far, far better than the lawlessness and anarchy that 
prevailed for so many years.  In the West, the view is more 
jaundiced.  Like regional states, some Western governments 
have welcomed the re-establishment of order in areas 
previously dominated by criminal elements.  However, others 
were horrified by the human rights abuses that accompanied 
the government\'s campaign in ethnic areas, solidifying their 
view of the GOB as a brutal dictatorship. 
 
24. (C) Finally, but perhaps most seriously, there is really 
no guarantee that the government\'s work will last.  For 
whatever success the GOB has had over the past fourteen years 
in ending the ethnic wars and reconstructing the Union of 
Burma, it has failed miserably in dealing with its own 
problems as a government.  Even setting aside the deep 
resentment that it has engendered among the Burmese 
themselves through the long denial of their basic human and 
political rights, and its failure to deliver any semblance of 
prosperity, it has also failed to establish a fiscal basis 
for continued government.  Having tried, like many before 
them, to run a government on the surpluses of state-owned 
enterprises, the  SPDC has been left high and dry as those 
surpluses have disappeared.  None of these problems are easy 
to deal with, but, if the government does not deal with them 
effectively, then all of its work in reconstructing the 
Burmese Union, through war, diplomacy, and political 
negotiations, could well be washed away.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/08/2013 
TAGS: EAID, PHUM, BM, UNDP, Human Rights, NGO 
SUBJECT: UNDP\'S PROGRAM IN BURMA - LINKING BASIC HUMAN 
NEEDS AND BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d), 
 
1. (C) Summary: UNDP will be seeking a more flexible mandate 
for its operations in Burma at the January 21 meeting in New 
York.  The USG should support that request, but should also 
demand that UNDP and other UN agencies play a more active 
role in regard to human rights monitoring and protection on a 
day-to-day basis in Burma.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) UNDP has scheduled a meeting in New York on January 21 
to review UNDP\'s program in Burma.  The centerpiece of that 
meeting will be an independent evaluation done in May and 
June, 2002 on UNDP\'s programs here.  That assessment 
basically concluded that UNDP\'s projects in Burma are being 
carried out in accordance with the instructions of the 
Governing Council and the Executive Board.  The report also 
concluded that UNDP\'s projects are having a significant 
positive impact on the intended beneficiaries.  According to 
the report, UNDP\'s projects addressed all the critical areas 
mandated by the Executive Board, with a strong emphasis on 
the poorest segments of Burma\'s rural population.  Moreover, 
most of the projects exceeded their goals and targets and all 
were delivered within budget. Among the most notable 
accomplishments were the establishment of \"self care\" 
facilities in 3700 villages involving over 370,000 women; the 
development of water and sanitation programs in 2400 
villages; the establishment of micro-credit schemes in 11 
townships; the creation of over 1000 community self-reliance 
groups covering more than three-quarters of the target 
households; and improvements in food production with the 
result that 80 percent of the villages within UNDP\'s program 
area are now self-sufficient in food 
 
3. (U) For all this success, however, the assessment also 
notes that UNDP\'s programs now reach only a small percentage 
(about 4 percent) of Burma\'s rural population.  The impact of 
projects has also been undermined by the macro-economic 
policy environment within which they are implemented.  In 
addition, little has been done to deal with the devastating 
impact that economic shocks and natural disasters can have on 
vulnerable rural populations. Finally, but most seriously, 
the sustainability of all of all of UNDP\'s projects is 
questionable.  Most are now being implemented through ad hoc 
structures with few, if any links, to national institutions, 
such as the national health and education services.  As a 
result, there is a real question as to how many will survive, 
if and when UNDP funding is cut off.  The assessment traces 
several of these problems -- particularly the problems 
regarding sustainability -- to UNDP\'s current mandate, which 
directs UNDP to allocate its resources in Burma only \"to 
programs which meet humanitarian and basic human needs 
through projects which have a sustainable impact at the grass 
roots level in the areas of primary health care, the 
environment, HIV/AIDS, education and food security\" and 
recommends that UNDP expand that mandate to bring it in line 
with that of other UN agencies in Burma. 
 
4. (C) We basically agree with the assessment.  For all its 
good work, UNDP\'s program in Burma has basically become a 
high-cost, low-impact program that is not adequately serving 
the needs of either donors or its intended recipients.  If 
UNDP continues as it has to date, it will only ensure that 
its programs reach only a fraction of the rural population 
with activities whose impact and sustainability will both be 
strictly limited.  To act efficiently and effectively on 
behalf of Burma\'s poor, UNDP needs to be able to work on a 
larger scale with local government officials and national 
institutions, including representatives of social and 
economic service ministries, such as the Ministries of 
Health, Education and Agriculture.  Such latitude to work 
with the GOB\'s economic and social service ministries will 
not contribute to the repressive powers of the regime, but 
will ensure that the social and economic programs that UNDP 
is seeking to establish in Burma will have the institutional 
underpinnings to ensure their durability.  It will also bring 
UNDP\'s mandate in line with the mandates of other UN 
agencies, like UNICEF (one of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s favorite 
organizations), which already works closely and productively 
with Burma\'s Health and Education Ministries.  That 
collaboration has not compromised UNICEF\'s programs in any 
sense, but has allowed it to support programs of major 
importance, such as the eradication of polio, which can only 
be done on a nationwide basis.  Similar flexibility in regard 
to the implementation of UNDP\'s program would allow similar 
results in regard to both the scope and impact of UNDP\'s 
rural development programs. 
 
5. (C) That flexibility, however, should be combined with 
additional responsibilities.  If UNDP is to be granted more 
flexibility to develop more effective and more valuable 
programs, then the USG should also demand that it play a more 
effective and forthright role in providing for not only basic 
human needs, but also basic human rights in Burma.  Right 
now, of all the UN agencies in Burma, only the ILO and UNHCR 
have joined with ICRC in consistently bringing human rights 
violations to the attention of the GOB.  While several others 
(notably UNICEF and UNDP) have established relatively 
widespread programs in Burma (e.g. for UNDP, in Burma\'s Dry 
Zone, the Irrawaddy Delta, Shan State and remote border areas 
of Chin, Kachin and Rakhine States), none have yet been 
willing to play an effective monitoring, protection and 
advocacy role on human rights issues.  In some cases, this 
has led to severe criticism of UNDP\'s programs by groups -- 
such as Aung San Suu Kyi\'s National league for Democracy -- 
which have accused to the UN of turning a blind eye to the 
regime\'s abuses. This neglect of human rights issues by the 
UN agencies has also left day-to-day reporting on human 
rights issues in the hands of politically motivated groups, 
often based in Thailand, of varying credibility.  The net 
result has been a situation which benefits no one, least of 
all the UN agencies. 
 
6. (C) In recent months, the GOB has shown an increased 
willingness to allow human rights monitoring in sensitive 
areas throughout Burma by the ILO, the ICRC and UNHCR.  The 
UN, and particularly UNDP, which provides leadership for all 
UN agencies here, should take advantage of this new 
flexibility to lay down markers regarding its overriding 
interest in protecting the basic human rights of Burma\'s 
rural poor.  We have discussed this with UNDP\'s outgoing 
resident coordinator and he believes, as we do, that such 
human rights monitoring and advocacy work is necessary, and 
can be done effectively by UNDP and the other UN agencies, 
given adequate support and direction from the Governing 
Council and the Executive Board. 
 
7. (C) In short, we are convinced that UNDP needs a more 
flexible mandate in order to do their job properly in Burma. 
They should be able to discuss macro-economic issues of key 
importance to rural populations with the relevant 
authorities.  They should also be able to work with the 
Burmese social and economic ministries in exactly the fashion 
that other UN agencies already do.  However, we are equally 
convinced that there is scope and need for greater action in 
regard to the protection of human rights in all the areas 
where the UN is active in Burma.  From that perspective, we 
recommend that the US delegate to the upcoming UNDP meeting 
discuss with UN staff and other Executive Board members the 
possibility of coupling any plans to increase the flexibility 
of UNDP\'s mandate in Burma with an expanded mandate in regard 
to human rights monitoring and protection activities among 
Burma\'s rural population.  The UN, as a body, has already 
recognized its responsibility for human rights in Burma by 
the appointment of a Special Rapporteur.  However, it needs 
to develop the capacity to carry out those responsibilities 
at a grass roots level on a day-to-day basis. Making the 
protection of human rights an integral part of UNDP\'s mandate 
in Burma will help meet that need.

SUBJECT: JAPAN EXPANDS DEBT RELIEF; AGREES TO HOST 
CONSULTATIVE GROUP ON BURMA 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Japan has agreed to host a consultative group 
meeting on Burma in mid-February.  It is also edging towards 
support for economic reform in Burma.  How far it can or 
should go in that regard, absent real political reform, will 
likely be one of the prime topics at the February meeting. 
End Summary. 
 
Consultative Group Meeting 
 
2. (C)  The Japanese Government has agreed to host a 
consultative group meeting on Burma in mid-February. 
According to Japanese Embassy sources, the agenda will 
include political transition, economic reform and human 
rights issues.  The Japanese may also take advantage of the 
meeting to present a summary of the economic reform 
recommendations that have emerged from their Structural 
Adjustment Project.  The Thai and Indian Embassies have both 
told us that their governments plan to attend. 
 
Structural Adjustment Program 
 
3. (C) The latest workshop on the Japanese Structural 
Adjustment Program was held December 21 and 22.  David Abel 
headed the Burmese side; a Japanese academic (Professor 
Odaka) headed the Japanese.  The Burmese accepted the 
Japanese recommendations, including currency unification, but 
argued as usual that they needed time and financing support 
for major adjustments.  The Japanese also pushed the idea of 
\"special zones\" for industry and agriculture within which 
some of the GOB\'s regulations might be lifted.  Again, the 
Burmese accepted the idea, but made no commitments on 
implementation. 
 
4. (C) The next step will be a government-to-government 
meeting (as opposed to the latest workshop, which was billed 
as an academic exchange) probably in early March to work on 
an implementation plan for the proposed reforms. At that 
point, Japanese Embassy sources indicated, they will have to 
talk about programs of financial support. 
 
Debt Relief 
 
5. (C) The Japanese government will provide Burma with debt 
relief equivalent to about 150 billion yen ($1.3 billion) 
under a program that will be implemented starting in February 
2004 and which will cover all maturities coming due after 
April 2003.  According to the Embassy, the program will not 
cover arrears to Japan, which, in Burma\'s case, are now 
equivalent to about $2 billion.  Those arrears will still be 
available for use as leverage in encouraging economic reform. 
 
6. (C) The program is not specific to Burma, although Burma 
is easily the largest beneficiary.  The debts of a whole 
variety of heavily-indebted states, totaling about 900 
billion yen, will be forgiven under the program.  There is 
also no connection to political developments in Burma. 
According to Japanese Embassy sources, the new debt relief 
initiative was the product of a general review of Japanese 
debt relief practices.  Previously, the Japanese had forgiven 
debt on an annual basis by providing matching grants for any 
debt service paid by heavily-indebted countries.  However, 
asking countries to come up with the debt payments before 
relief could be granted made the whole program dependent on 
recipient nations\' cash flow.  Whenever recipient nations had 
cash flow problems; i.e., whenever they needed the relief 
most, the whole program broke down.  The new approach will 
avoid those problems. 
 
Comment 
 
7.  The Japanese are obviously edging towards support for 
economic reform in Burma.  They will want to talk about this 
at the Consultative Group meeting in February and will likely 
argue that it is time to move beyond humanitarian assistance 
and the treatment of symptoms in Burma to the treatment of 
root causes.  That in turn could set the stage for a debate 
as to whether anything can or should be done to treat these 
problems absent real political reform. End Comment.

SUBJECT: THAI MINISTERS POISED TO OVERRUN RANGOON 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary; At least six Thai ministers and the Chiefs of 
the Thai Armed Services will all parade through Burma during 
January in pursuit of agreements on trade and illegal 
workers, among other issues.  There may also be some action 
on the border in early February between the Burmese and the 
Shan State Army (South). End Summary. 
 
Visits 
 
2. (C) There will be a parade of Thai ministers in Rangoon in 
January.  According to Thai Embassy sources, between January 
17 and January 27, the Thai Ministers of Education, Commerce, 
Labor, and Science and Technology, the Chiefs of the Thai 
Armed Services, and Deputy Prime Ministers Chavalit and Korn 
will all visit Burma.  The Thai Minister of Defense and 
Supreme Commander Surayud may also accompany the two Prime 
Ministers. 
 
History 
 
3. (C) The Education Minister will focus on the treatment of 
Thai/Burmese history in each nation\'s textbooks.  He 
reportedly led the effort to purge Thai textbooks of a lot of 
their anti-Burmese venom and plans to urge the Burmese to 
take similar steps in regard to the anti-Thai propaganda that 
pollutes many of their history books. 
 
Border Trade 
 
3. (C) The Commerce Minister will try to reach agreement on 
settlement arrangements for border.  The Thai have been 
pushing for some time for an arrangement that would allow the 
settlement of accounts on border trade only once every six 
months, rather than on a transaction-by-transaction basis. 
Normally this would work to Burma\'s benefit, because it would 
allow Burma to run an automatically financed deficit in its 
trade with Thailand, but. given current Burmese efforts to 
crack down on over- and under-invoicing, and on capital 
flight through trade channels, the proposal had not sparked 
much interest among the Burmese.  The Commerce Minister hoped 
to change this during his visit. 
 
Illegal Workers 
 
4. (C) The Two Deputy Prime Ministers and the Labor Minister 
will focus on illegal Burmese workers in Thailand.  Thailand 
submitted a draft MOU on the repatriation of illegal workers 
to Burma on October 7, but had not received a response. 
Meanwhile, NaSaKa (Burmese border police) officers had begun 
to raise questions about procedures for the return of illegal 
workers.  Basically, NaSaKa wanted to apply the same 
procedures now used on the Bangladeshi border with refugees 
to ensure that all persons who were sent back from Thailand 
really were Burmese citizens.  They also wanted to open only 
one repatriation point (at Myawaddy), rather than the three 
requested by Thailand.  The Thais believed that the Burmese 
procedures were impractical, and hoped to talk them out of 
them during the upcoming meeting.  If they were successful, 
they would sign the MOU on January 27.  If not -- and right 
now that seemed most probable -- then they would talk some 
more. 
 
Insurgents and NGOs 
 
5. (C) On other issues, the Thai Embassy sources said that 
the Royal Thai Army had pushed many of the Shan State 
Army-South\'s largest armed units into Burma and was now 
waiting for the Burmese to finish them off, probably with an 
attack in early February.  The Thai sources said that the RTA 
would not block the border, but would not allow the SSA units 
to re-enter Thailand armed.  If they fled the Burmese, they 
would have to leave their arms behind.  As for the NGOs on 
the border, Prime Minister Thaksin had ordered that the rules 
and regulations governing their operations be \"streamlined\" 
and enforced.  This had spooked some of the NGOs and led to 
protests by many of the European embassies in Bangkok. 
However, there was no intent to shut the NGOs down 
completely, the Thai sources said.  The RTG only wished to 
ensure that they operated fully in accordance with the law. 
The Shan Rape Cases 
 
6. (C) The Thai Embassy sources also confirmed that the RTG 
had never raised the Shan rape cases with the GOB.  Asked 
why, given the close ethnic relations between the Thai and 
the Shan (Shan is the Burmese word for Siam), the Thai 
officers said that the RTG had questions about the 
reliability of the NGO reports.  The Thai government knew the 
political background of both the Shan Human Rights Foundation 
and the Shan Women\'s Action Network and was not prepared to 
rely on their reports on such inflammatory issues.  The only 
statement on the case to date had been made by the Chairman 
of the Thai Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Committee, but he 
had been speaking individually, not on behalf of the RTG. 
 
Comment 
 
7. (C)  The Thais and Burmese are almost a classic case of 
historic enemies trying to feel their way to a new 
relationship, with Thais, at least for the moment, the 
suitors.  Nothing is easy; every issue is emotionally 
fraught.  Nevertheless, the two sides are making progress. 
If they can strike some agreements in January on the 
treatment of history, border trade and/or illegal workers, 
then the next round of talks should be that much easier. 
However, there is a lot of history to overcome and there is 
always the chance that untoward events will derail the entire 
process. End Comment.

REF: RANGOON 45 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary. During a conversation with David Rockefeller 
at the Chief of Mission\'s residence on January 12th, Aung San 
Suu Kyi talked about the need for a speedy transition, the 
dangerous state of the nation\'s education system, and her 
growing public support outside Rangoon.  Unfortunately, ASSK 
had little to say to Mr. Rockefeller\'s repeated question: 
\"what can we do to help?\"  However, she made it evident that 
she still opposed \"engagement,\" though additional blanket 
sanctions were also not the answer.  She did tout working 
with the International Labor Organization (ILO) to identify 
and punish export-focused factories with unacceptable working 
conditions.  However until there is a clear public 
pronouncement from her, we see little chance that the 
international community will alter its varied interpretations 
of what\'s \"best\" for Burma.  End summary. 
 
Mr. Rockefeller Comes to Rangoon 
 
2. (SBU) David Rockefeller and his traveling party came to 
Burma for a 10-day tourist trip throughout the country. 
While here he took the opportunity to meet with local 
business leaders and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK), and plans 
to meet with Secretary One, General Khin Nyunt.  ASSK joined 
the Rockefeller party at the Chief of Mission\'s residence for 
an informal Sunday tea and discussion about the current 
situation in Burma. 
 
Sanctions: Psychological Not Economic Damage 
 
3. (C) Three times David Rockefeller, and other members of 
his party, pressed ASSK about \"what the United States 
could/should be doing\" to help expedite change here.  Though 
ASSK was adamant that \"speedy change\" was essential, she did 
not give specific prescriptions for how U.S. policy could 
force the issue.  She mentioned only that there should be 
better policy coordination between nations and between 
international organizations. 
 
4. (C) On sanctions, ASSK was more specific.  She insisted 
that while sanctions caused minimal economic damage to the 
regime, the \"psychological impact\" has been significant.  She 
pointed to the informal boycott of tourism as helping to foil 
the regime\'s ballyhooed efforts to make Burma a major tourist 
destination.  Such a boycott, she said, also has an impact on 
the government\'s pocketbook and has the residual benefit of 
preventing Burma from being a country over reliant on tourism 
for hard currency earnings.  ASSK did admit that there was 
some benefit to travelers coming to Burma if they take the 
time to \"learn as much as possible about the country.\" (Note: 
despite ASSK\'s support of the informal boycott, she has told 
us on several occasions she opposes an outright tourism ban. 
We note that despite her reluctance to have Burma become 
reliant on tourism, currently the industry provides one of 
the very few relatively well-paying job opportunities for 
English speaking young people.) 
 
5. (C) On the question of textile sanctions, ASSK was a bit 
less sanguine about their benefits.  She does not support 
full-scale sanctions because of the disproportionate damage 
they would cause to working people.  Instead, she said, more 
creative solutions were needed to focus as much as possible 
on helping the workers while attacking the regime.  One idea, 
she suggested, was to team up with the International Labor 
Organization (ILO) to require inspections of all 
export-producing garment factories in Burma.  Only those that 
the ILO certified as providing healthy working environments 
would be allowed to export to the United States.  She added 
that exports could be banned outright from the few factories 
that were controlled in whole or in part by the government. 
(Note: we\'d heard indirectly of this proposal before, but it 
was the first time she\'d mentioned to us directly.  It shows 
a clear position of ASSK against broad trade sanctions that 
would hurt labor-intensive industries.  However, as 
inspections are not part of the ILO\'s mandate here we will 
have to follow up with the local ILO representative to assess 
the feasibility of this idea.) 
International Community is Losing its Way 
6. (C) ASSK had sharp words for countries that she saw moving 
toward policies of engagement with the SPDC regime.  She said 
that engagement with the regime helped its efforts to justify 
its own existence and policies, making it harder to convince 
the SPDC to step down.  She singled out Japan and Australia 
for having \"less than helpful\" attitudes.  Specifically she 
criticized Japan\'s \"reluctance to offend\" and recent decision 
to forgive $1.3 billion in debt (see reftel).  She said this 
move, along with China\'s offer to give $200 million in soft 
loans to Burma, will give a large psychological (though not a 
large economic) boost to the regime.  Australia, she said, 
while giving \"lip service\" to democracy is actually more 
\"ASEAN than ASEAN\" in its relations with the regime and its 
reluctance to rock the boat.  (Note: ASSK was likely 
referring to the Australians\' work with the regime on a human 
rights training program.) 
 
7. (C) ASSK was less critical of ASEAN members and China. 
She said that none of these countries actively supports 
democracy in Burma, but at least they are \"honest\" about 
their true positions.  Twice she mentioned the PRC, saying 
that while it is no friend of democracy, it is very pragmatic 
and appreciates stability.  She thought it would be 
worthwhile to work with China to convince them to take \"a 
more pragmatic approach\" at least to border issues (e.g., 
drug production and smuggling).  It will also be important, 
she said, to include China in international cooperative 
efforts to make change here. 
 
8. (C) She was slightly less charitable about Malaysian 
leader Dr. Mahatir, who was not given permission to see ASSK 
during his latest trip to Rangoon.  She said that she was 
unhappy he did not take the initiative to come and see her, 
instead asking the regime for permission.  In addition, it 
was a \"pity,\" she said, that following his visit Dr. Mahatir 
did not come out publicly to express his disappointment about 
his treatment by the regime. 
 
Political Situation: Improving, But too Slow 
 
9. (C) The Rockefeller group was interested generally in the 
current political state of play.  She said that repression of 
the people has decreased since she and the SPDC began their 
\"exchange of views\" in September 2000.  She was also 
encouraged by seeing on her travels the amount of grassroots 
support for her and the NLD.  On her recent trips to Shan and 
Arakan States, she said that she was received even more 
warmly than she had been during her travels in 1988-89, just 
prior to the 1990 elections.  Another difference from \'88-\'89 
is the increased support she\'s noticed from young people and 
members of various ethnic nationalities.   On a negative 
note, she insisted that the regime\'s talk of change is only 
superficial, aimed cynically only at improving its 
international image. 
 
10. (C) Despite the positives, ASSK was very concerned that 
change was coming far too slowly.  She joked about those who 
advise her to be \"patient\" or \"go slow,\" saying \"slow is one 
thing, a snail\'s pace is another.\"  The longer change takes, 
she warned, the more difficult it will be to restart the 
country under a new government.  She said that this was a 
particular problem because of the current state of the 
education system.  Very few young people today, except those 
affiliated with the military or those who can study abroad, 
are getting a quality education.  There is a very real 
concern that Burma will soon become a country of \"uneducated 
people,\" with terrible consequences for the nation\'s 
political and economic future.  She said that the current 
regime\'s hostility toward education and economic reform is 
the primary reason that Burma cannot develop along the lines 
of other previously military-ruled Asian nations (namely 
Taiwan and South Korea), where government support for 
education remained strong. 
 
Policy Changes Apparent, but Not Public 
 
11. (C) Based on this discussion, and others we\'ve had with 
her in recent months, ASSK\'s position may be shifting ever so 
slightly.  She recognizes the increasing humanitarian 
catastrophe that is occurring here because of the regime\'s 
neglect.  She is skittish of additional sanctions because of 
their huge economic impact on the people, and limited 
economic impact on the regime.  One of ASSK\'s economic 
advisors has told us privately that he is pushing her hard to 
publicly open up for additional international assistance 
(carefully monitored and disbursed so as to avoid the 
government) for education and basic healthcare.  ASSK did 
not, however, take the opportunity of having a supportive and 
sympathetic Mr. Rockefeller on hand to clearly propose any 
significant new directions.  We have told ASSK, and will 
continue to do so, that it is essential that she speak out 
directly if she wants the international community to follow 
her lead in revising its collective Burma policies.  End 
comment.

SUBJECT: BAD GOVERNANCE HAMPERS UNICEF\'S EFFORTS IN BURMA 
 
Classified By: CDA, a.i. RON MCMULLEN FOR REASON 1.5(D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  UNICEF\'s $12m annual program in Burma is 
striving to improve child welfare in a country where 35% of 
children under the age of 5 are malnourished.  It has 
achieved some laudable successes, but overall prospects are 
severely constrained by an inept, illegitimate, and corrupt 
military regime.  DCM participated in a UNICEF-organized trip 
to normally restricted areas of Shan State January 9-12.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) UNICEF\'S EFFORTS WELL-RECEIVED IN SHAN STATE: 
UNICEF organized a familiarization visit for diplomats to 
Shan State January 9-12 to coincide with National 
Immunization Day.  The group visited schools, rural clinics, 
and administrative centers southeast of Taunggyi in townships 
normally off limits to foreigners.  These rugged hill tracts 
are populated by non-Burman ethnic groups, particularly Shan 
and Pa-O, that have bridled at rule from Rangoon.  The UNICEF 
group was everywhere warmly received by the local people, who 
appeared genuinely grateful for UNICEF\'s health and education 
programs. 
 
3.  (U) JAPANESE AID EVIDENT:  The Japanese ambassador was 
given something of a hero\'s welcome, as many nurses opened 
nearly empty medicine cabinets in rural clinics to show 
essential drugs donated by Japan in conjunction with UNICEF 
programs.  At one stop a grateful health worker pulled up on 
a Japanese-donated motorcycle, offering to give the Japanese 
ambassador a lift to the next site.  At every school the 
group passed out Japanese pencils to students--all donated to 
UNICEF by Japan for this purpose. 
 
4.  (SBU) COMMUNITIES PITCHING IN:  Villagers nearly 
everywhere add their own resources to supplement or build on 
UNICEF projects.  Most UNICEF-assisted schools had certified 
government teachers who spoke Burmese; younger students spoke 
Shan or Pa-O, but little or no Burmese.  Parents in most 
cases hired local, non-certified teachers (fluent in the 
vernacular) to augment the Ministry of Education provided 
faculty.  At one school the community replaced the hand pump 
on a UNICEF-provided tube well with a diesel-powered pump to 
supply safe water to the entire community (see below).  Local 
residents often assist government nurses and doctors at rural 
clinics, who make about $5 and $8 per month, with food and 
other in-kind support. 
 
5. (C) BUT POOR GOVERNANCE UNDERMINES PROSPECTS:  UNICEF is 
perhaps the most effective of the various UN agencies 
operating in Burma and has made notable progress in 
eradicating polio, iodizing salt, and providing vitamin A 
supplements to children.  The diplomats on this trip 
personally administered oral polio immunizations and vitamin 
A supplements to scores of two-year olds at various UNICEF 
locations.  Next month the GOB Ministry of Health is going to 
announce that wild polio has been eradicated in Burma. 
 
--  However, just as an ebb tide lowers all boats, so too 
does poor governance in Burma harm overall levels of child 
welfare despite a few specific improvements brokered by 
UNICEF. 
 
-- At the school with the diesel-powered water pump, the 
village has seen the price of diesel fuel quadruple since 
they bought the pump 16 months ago.  Due to soaring fuel 
costs, the village can only afford to run the pump for an 
inadequate ten hours per month.  The SPDC\'s economic 
mismanagement is causing inflation and other hardships for 
the country\'s rural poor (i.e., most Burmese). 
 
-- In one Pa-O township the (ethnic Burman) health officials 
told us they could not access the southern third of the 
region readily, due to an uneasy relationship with the Pa-O 
National Organization, an ethnic rebel group that signed a 
cease-fire with the SPDC.  An edgy truce is better than 
active combat, but the advent of a legitimate, representative 
administration would improve access to child welfare programs 
particularly in ethnic minority regions. 
 
-- The Shan State Guest House in Taunggyi is a beautiful 
colonial-era structure.  Situated a thousand feet above it on 
a cliff is a sprawling mansion called \"Mount Pleasant.\"  The 
group of diplomats, having just spent 3 days visiting bare 
local clinics staffed by dedicated nurses making $5 per 
month, discovered that Mount Pleasant is a new military 
guesthouse reserved for senior generals.  Secretary 1 Khin 
Nyunt particularly favors it, we were told.  Oddly, the 
guesthouse sports a large megalithic structure rather like 
Stonehenge in its front yard.  Such SPDC resource 
allocations, i.e., building itself posh mountaintop retreats 
while 35% of the country\'s children are malnourished, 
according to UN figures, ought to give pause to international 
donors when asked by Burma for concessional aid. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  If UNICEF and its sister UN organizations 
were better funded and more flexible, they might be able to 
make marginal improvements in child welfare and other aspects 
of human development in this poor country.  Absent a 
representative and accountable government, however, their 
efforts are likely to be minimized or undone by a military 
regime more intent on its own well-being than on that of the 
people of Burma.  End Comment.

1.  This is an action message.  See paragraph 7. 
 
2.  Summary: The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has 
invited the USG to participate in the final evaluation of the 
Wa Alternative Development Project.  We have been the prime 
movers behind this project.  If possible, we should plan to 
participate in the evaluation.  End Summary. 
 
3.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has invited 
the United States and other major donors to the Wa 
Alternative Development Project to participate (at their own 
expense) in the project\'s final evaluation.  UNODC has 
contracted for two international and one independent Burmese 
experts to conduct the evaluation from March 7 to April 3, 
2003.  Donor experts (one each) would complement that team. 
 
4.  We recommend that the USG accept the invitation.  The 
United States has been the prime donor for the Wa Alternative 
Development Project.  While other donors (Italy, Germany, and 
Japan) have lately stepped in to pick up some of the 
financial burden, the United States has contributed about 
two-thirds of the project\'s $11 million cost over the past 
four years.  Simple prudence dictates that we ensure that 
those funds were well spent. 
 
5.  Secondly, there may be lessons to be learned from the 
project, which appears to have done relatively well in an 
extraordinarily short period, despite the stress induced by 
cuts in donor support in 2001.  Through the end of 2002, the 
project had hit its targets for opium reduction, health, and 
education, and was opening up a new phase (through the 
construction of a Japanese financed canal in the Nam Kar 
basin) that may allow it to entirely close the food deficit 
in the project area.  That is a fairly remarkable performance 
for a project that was executed under extraordinarily 
difficult circumstances. 
 
6. Thirdly, UNODC has proposed extending and expanding its 
alternative development projects in Burma as part of its next 
five year plan, starting in 2004.  That plan calls for 
extending the Wa Alternative Development Project through 2008 
and expanding its coverage to areas in the Wa territories 
north of Pang Sang and into areas controlled by the Kokang 
Chinese.  Both areas are major centers of opium production 
and operations in them will require a major expansion of 
UNODC\'s budget in Burma.  Before the United States commits 
support for that effort, we should be certain that the 
current approach is both appropriate and effective. 
 
7. Action requested: Designation of a U.S. expert to 
participate in UNODC\'s evaluation of the Wa Alternative 
Development Project from March 7 to April 3, 2003.

SUBJECT: BURMA: THE ILLUSION OF ECONOMIC STABILITY 
 
REF: A. RANGOON 30 
 
     B. 02 RANGOON 1468 
 
Classified By: CDA a.i., Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Since last Fall, Burma has seen the formation 
of new government economic advisory committees, a relatively 
stable kyat, and slowing consumer price inflation.  Could 
this mean the regime is finally taking real steps to improve 
the economic situation?  Unfortunately not.  The exchange 
rate stability is illusory, the slowing consumer price rises 
mask a still rampant inflation rate.  As for the committees, 
nothing good can come of them.  End summary. 
 
Government Committees: Training Grounds for Corruption 
 
2. (C) As a sign of its earnest efforts to remedy the 
nation\'s economic woes, the regime established in September 
several committees to monitor and advise on the nation\'s 
economic crises.  These green ribbon committees, all chaired 
by top SPDC members and military trustees, are ostensibly 
looking at issues ranging from fuel conservation to commodity 
price control.  While this seems encouraging, local 
economists say that such a move is commonplace and rarely 
turns into legitimate reform.  More likely, some opined, 
these committees end up as training grounds for young 
officers on how to take advantage of the country\'s economic 
distortions for their own benefit. 
 
Exchange Rates: Pressure is Building 
 
3. (SBU) Nonetheless, statistics collected by the Embassy 
show a relatively stable dollar/kyat market exchange rate 
over the past two months.  The kyat raced from 900 in August 
to 1310 kyat/dollar in mid-September before plateauing at 
about 1000 kyat/dollar from October through the end of 2002. 
This value of the kyat is still lower than it was at the 
beginning of 2002 (720 kyat/dollar), and is still 167 times 
below the official rate (6 kyat/dollar).  However, it is 
significant that such stability could come, and endure, 
without any evident economic reforms or positive changes in 
the business climate. 
 
4. (SBU) As we reported in Ref B, this curious period of 
stability is largely due to the government\'s decision to 
remove a major distorting factor from the foreign exchange 
market.  The military-directed Myanmar Economic Holdings, 
Ltd. (MEHL), not required like other importers to cover their 
import expenses with export revenues, had been a major 
consumer of black market dollars to fund its exclusive right 
to import diesel fuel and palm oil for cooking.  These import 
privileges, unfortunately bred significant corruption and 
higher prices.  Thus, the regime, in cooperation with MEHL\'s 
new leadership, decided in late 2002 to crack down on MEHL 
and re-assign the right to import diesel and cooking oil to 
state-controlled entities.  This decision in a stroke reduced 
significantly the demand for \"uncovered\" dollars on the open 
market.  The government also periodically fine tunes the 
exchange rate through \"administrative measures\" (e.g., 
arresting large money changers). 
 
5. (SBU) The government\'s increasing miserliness on the 
granting of import licenses also helps to explain the 
stability of the kyat.  Over the past several months, 
importers have complained about regular GOB refusal of 
license requests or extremely slow approval.  Also, they say, 
even approved licenses are regularly for 50 percent less than 
the amount requested.  Reflecting this, the recorded value of 
imports fell throughout 2002 by about 35 percent, according 
to official statistics. 
 
Prices: Consumer Goods Steady, but Inflation Roars 
 
6. (SBU) Despite a drop in the official value of imports, 
there has been no sharp rise in the cost of imported consumer 
goods in Rangoon.  From October through December, the price 
changes of our basket of imported consumer items have been 
about the same, or in one case lower, than the overall 
monthly CPI increase, which itself has slowed over the past 
three months.  The only significant increase in price in 
December\'s basket came from cooking oil -- perhaps a reaction 
to the new government-controlled importing and distribution 
arrangement. 
7. (C) A number of factors appear to explain this.  First, 
importers tell us that they have kept their volume steady, 
despite tighter import controls, by shifting their purchases 
from better quality, more expensive Thai, Japanese, Korean, 
and western products to cheaper Chinese goods.  Second, for 
consumer goods a virile black market here has kept the supply 
relatively steady, combined with some import substitution 
(particularly in snack foods and dry noodles) and some dip in 
demand commensurate with decreasing standards of living. 
Finally, the import statistics may be somewhat misleading as 
many importers underinvoice to bring in more product for 
their dollar\'s worth of export revenue, covering themselves 
by converting kyat earnings at the curbside market and moving 
it offshore through the black market exchange system (hon 
ti).  However, importers tell us that Customs has been 
cracking down on this practice lately, unilaterally marking 
up the invoice or requiring proof in the form of export 
records from the country of origin. 
 
8. (C) Furthermore, broader inflation remains a serious 
problem countrywide, especially when combined with stagnant 
wages and the eroding value of the kyat.  We estimate the 
rate for Rangoon in 2002 at about 60 percent.  One of the 
most serious causes is excess money supply due to the Central 
Bank\'s monetizing of chronic GOB budget deficits.  This, 
combined with a weak banking sector and the depreciation of 
the kyat, has led business people to unload kyat and snatch 
up legal assets (especially real estate, cars, gold, and 
gems) as fast as they can.  The resulting asset bubbles have 
been exacerbated by the boom in informal financial 
institutions that are investing in these same assets their 
surprisingly large deposits (see Ref A).  The high cost of 
transportation and imported fertilizer and tractors, combined 
with supply and distribution problems have also kept rice 
prices at historic high levels.  Likewise, the dysfunctional 
distribution system for fuel has led to steep price hikes for 
black market diesel and gasoline. 
 
Comment 
 
9. (C) In short, there is little evidence that the recently 
stabilized exchange rate has anything to do with any new 
stability in the economy.  While regime policies imposing 
tighter import controls and reining in the greedy MEHL have 
helped economize on foreign exchange and have helped squeeze 
out some corruption from the trading system, there has been 
no real effort to deal with the excess liquidity generated by 
the central government\'s budget deficit and the still 
expanding operations of the unofficial financial 
institutions.  Absent moves in these areas to deal with the 
rapidly expanding money supply, there is little that tighter 
enforcement of the GOB\'s current rules can do.  As a 
consequence, most people are still looking to a sharp 
increase in the exchange rate this spring.  Eighteen months 
ago, we forecast an exchange rate of 1800-2000 kyat/dollar by 
the end of Burmese FY 2002-03 (March 31).  Now it appears 
that the exchange rate may come in at the low end of that 
range, but even that will represent a near doubling of the 
exchange rate against the dollar in one year -- not in any 
sense a sign of a stabilizing economy.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA SEEKS CLOSER CHINA TIES 
 
REF: BEIJING 1078 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: DCM RON MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: BILATERAL TIES BETWEEN THE CHINESE AND 
BURMESE GOVERNMENTS SEEM TO BE STRENGTHENING AT ALL LEVELS 
AND ON MANY FRONTS.  FROM THE BURMESE SIDE, THE RECENT 
EXCHANGE WITH THE PRC OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS EMPHASIZES THE 
FACT THAT BURMA IS BANKING ON DEVELOPING AN ENDURING SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA.  FROM EMBASSY BEIJING\'S REPORTING, 
IT APPEARS THAT THE PRC HAS A SIMILAR OBJECTIVE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GRANTS, LOANS, AND BOATS 
 
2. (C) FOLLOWING UP ON EMBASSY BEIJING\'S READOUT OF THE 
HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGE OF VISITS BETWEEN BURMA AND CHINA, WE 
SPOKE WITH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC 
DIVISION DIRECTOR DAW YIN YIN MYINT.  HER ACCOUNT OF THE 
VISITS CORROBORATED BEIJING\'S REPORT REGARDING THE EMPHASIS 
ON TECHNICAL COOPERATION, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AID, AND DEBT 
RELIEF.  ACCORDING TO DAW YIN YIN MYINT, THE TOTAL DEBT 
FORGIVEN BY THE PRC DURING THE RECENT VISITS WAS ABOUT 640 
MILLION RMB (ROUGHLY $80 MLN).  THIS IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN 
THE CALCULATION OF $65 MILLION WE MADE BASED ON COPIES WE 
OBTAINED OF THE DEBT RELIEF AGREEMENT. 
 
3. (C) DAW YIN YIN MYINT ALSO DISCUSSED WITH US THE QUESTION 
OF CHINESE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF THE IRRAWADDY RIVER AS AN 
OUTLET TO THE SEA FOR CHINESE MERCHANT VESSELS.  ACCORDING TO 
DAW YIN YIN MYINT, THIS PROJECT WAS FIRST DISCUSSED DURING 
CHINESE PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN\'S VISIT TO RANGOON IN DECEMBER 
2001.  HOWEVER, SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN NO PROGRESS MADE 
BECAUSE OF FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS OVER WHETHER THE RIVER 
WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONAL WATERWAY (ALLOWING 
CHINESE SHIPS TO FLY THE CHINESE FLAG), OR SIMPLY A CARGO 
TRANSIT ROUTE (REQUIRING THE USE OF BURMESE VESSELS).  A 
CHINESE DIPLOMAT STATIONED HERE ADDED THAT THE MATTER HAD 
BEEN STUCK OVER WHO WOULD PAY FOR THE NECESSARY DREDGING AND 
IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY TO MAKE THE RIVER FULLY NAVIGABLE FROM 
BHAMO IN SOUTHERN KACHIN STATE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE DELTA 
REGION. 
 
CHINA SEEKS ITS SOUTHWEST PASSAGE 
 
4. (C) ACCORDING TO DAW YIN YIN MYINT AND OTHER GOB 
OFFICIALS, SENIOR GENERAL THAN SHWE AND THE SPDC ARE 
PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING TIES WITH CHINA\'S YUNNAN, 
AND TO A LESSER DEGREE SICHUAN, PROVINCES.  SINCE DECEMBER, 
MOFA HAS HOSTED THREE DELEGATIONS FROM YUNNAN PROVINCE TO 
DISCUSS CLOSER ECONOMIC AND INVESTMENT TIES, IMPROVED 
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE BORDER AREA, AND ALSO \"BORDER 
MANAGEMENT\" CONCERNS (SUCH AS IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS AND 
COUNTERNARCOTICS). 
 
5. (C) IT IS CLEAR THAT BURMA VIEWS CHINA AS ITS MOST 
IMPORTANT ALLY IN THE REGION RIGHT NOW.  ALTHOUGH THE SPDC IS 
CURRENTLY COURTING GOOD TIES WITH INDIA, DAW YIN YIN MYINT 
SAID THAT THE BURMESE REGIME IS CULTIVATING A \"SPECIAL\" 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRC IN HOPES THAT THESE TIES WILL 
STRENGTHEN AND CONTINUE TO BEAR FRUIT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. 
 ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THE 
PRC IS VERY INTERESTED IN CLOSER TIES WITH BURMA AS AN 
ECONOMIC OUTLET TO THE SEA AND INTO THE REST OF SOUTHEAST 
ASIA.  THE BURMESE MOFA INSISTS, THOUGH, THAT FROM ITS POINT 
OF VIEW CHINA\'S RECENT ATTENTIONS ARE NOT \"AGGRESSIVE\" IN 
NATURE, AND THAT THERE IS NO QUID PRO QUO EXPECTED IN 
EXCHANGE FOR THE NEW SOFT LOANS AND ECONOMIC AID. 
 
COMMENT 
 
6. (C) THE FREQUENT OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS, THE AMOUNT OF 
CHINESE ASSISTANCE AND LENDING TO BURMA, AND THE INCREASING 
BILATERAL CONTACTS AT THE WORKING LEVEL INDICATE A MATURING 
OF THE BURMA-CHINA RELATIONSHIP.  ALTHOUGH AMONG AVERAGE 
BURMANS THERE IS STILL STRONG SUSPICION, AND SOME RESENTMENT, 
OF CHINESE INVESTMENT AND INFLUENCE IN THE COUNTRY, THE TWO 
GOVERNMENTS SEEM FOR THE TIME BEING TO BE FORGETTING OLD 
RIVALRIES AND BUILDING VERY STRONG ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND 
MILITARY TIES.  SIMILARLY, BURMESE TIES WITH INDIA, THAILAND, 
AND BANGLADESH ARE RAPIDLY EXPANDING IN A NETWORK OF REGIONAL 
SUPPORT THAT HAS HELPED DEFLATE WESTERN EFFORTS AT PRESSURE. 
ONE BURMESE OBSERVER HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE SPDC WAS 
REDOUBLING ITS EFFORTS AT REGIONAL FENCE-MENDING IN PART TO 
BUILD A BUFFER AGAINST WESTERN PRESSURE AND SANCTIONS.  PUT 
SIMPLY, BURMA IS NO LONGER ISOLATED AS IT ONCE WAS.  ON THE 
CONTRARY, EVERY ONE OF ITS NEIGHBORS APPEARS TO BE WORKING 
HARD TO REBUILD TRADE, INVESTMENT, AND INFRASTRUCTURE TIES 
WITH BURMA.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO REMEMBER AS 
WESTERN STATES CONSIDER WAYS OF DIRECTING THE GOB TOWARDS 
CHANGE.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: RUSSIAN MIGS AND REACTORS 
 
REF: 02 RANGOON 942 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Russia now has the only bilateral military 
and technical cooperation agreement with Burma, according to 
a Rangoon-based Russian diplomat. A draft agreement for the 
sale of a 10 megawatt research reactor was approved by the 
Russian government last year and is now under study by the 
GOB.  Twelve MIG-29s have also been delivered though they 
remain bare of weapons packages. End Summary. 
 
Military and Technical Cooperation  Agreement 
 
2. (C)  A Russian emboff told Poloff on January 30 that 
Russia is the only country that has a military and technical 
cooperation agreement with Burma.  Supposedly, that agreement 
was worked up to provide a framework for the sale of the 
nuclear reactor.  A first set of consultations under the 
agreement was held in Russia in 2002.  The next set will take 
place in Rangoon this year. 
 
Nuclear Reactor 
 
3. (C) Russia has approved a \"draft agreement\" for the sale 
of a 10 megawatt research reactor to Burma, but has still not 
received a response from the GOB, which has been studying the 
agreement since last year.  The Russian officer believes that 
money is the problem; the GOB does not have the $150 million 
that would be required to complete the whole project. 
Nevertheless, it is locked in to working with Russia.  Six 
hundred Burmese students (350 in 2001 and 250 in 2002) have 
already been sent to Moscow for training on all aspects of 
uranium mining and processing, and on reactor operation and 
research.  Once trained on Russian reactors, they\'re not 
going to be able to work on anything else. 
 
4. (C) As for uranium, the Russian said that the Burmese have 
identified four deposits and sent samples to Pakistan for 
assessment last year.  Reportedly, the assessment was 
positive; the ore is suitable for processing into reactor 
fuel.  However, it is still not clear how much uranium is 
available in each site.  For that, some further geological 
investigations will be necessary. 
 
5. (C) Asked why the GOB would want to spend $150 million of 
money they don\'t have on a reactor, the emboff said that he 
believed the GOB\'s ultimate objective was to become an 
exporter of reactor fuel \"in 10 to 20 years.\"  In any case, 
he insisted that the reactor (a 10 megawatt, light water 
system) was not suitable for the production of weapons.  He 
also said that the North Koreans were not involved in the 
reactor project.  The North Koreans wanted to sell Burma two 
submarines, he said, adding that he did not think they were 
looking to transfer any nuclear technology. 
 
MIG-29s 
 
6. (C) The Burmese have taken delivery of 12 MIG-29s, but 
have not paid anything other than the initial down payment, 
according to the Russian.  The remaining payments have been 
rescheduled over four years.  Nevertheless, Russia is ready 
to be patient.  MIG-29s have an operational life of about 40 
years, and the GOB will require spare parts, training, 
maintenance, and upgrades for as long as they maintain their 
MIG fleet.  In other words, the Russians feel they have the 
Burmese hooked and are content to wait for payment on the 
original purchase, so long as that purchase continued to 
throw up opportunities for further sales.   Reportedly, the 
MIG-29s are so far bare of any weapons packages.  The Russian 
Emboff speculated that they may have some political value to 
the GOB, as indicators of the GOB\'s long-term ambitions for 
the air force, but right now were essentially useless as 
weapons of war.  (DAO note:  Some MIG-29 training is in 
process.  The Burmese are also reportedly negotiating with 
Ukraine for air-to-air missiles though there are no confirmed 
reports of deliveries as yet.)

SUBJECT: UNHCR TO CLOSE IN BANGLADESH 
 
REF: DHAKA 190 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez, Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: UNHCR tells us it plans to close down its 
refugee operations in Bangladesh at the end of 2003.  In 
2004, it will look at the possibility of closing its 
operations in Burma\'s northern Rakhine State.  Whatever the 
merits of the decision in Bangladesh, in Burma, premature 
closure of UNHCR\'s operations will raise the risks of a new 
refugee crisis.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Hitoshi Mise, the Deputy Director for UNHCR\'s Asia 
Division told diplomats on February 4 that UNHCR would end 
support for refugee repatriation from Bangladesh on June 30, 
2003 and close down UNHCR\'s operations in Bangladesh entirely 
at the end of 2003.  It would review UNHCR\'s operations in 
Burma in 2004 and make a decision then whether to close there 
as well, probably at the end of 2004. 
 
3. (C) Mise said that this decision had been coming for some 
time.  UNHCR\'s operations in Bangladesh and Burma were among 
the most UNHCR\'s protracted.  Moreover, most refugees have 
already been repatriated.  Of the 250,000 refugees that left 
Burma for Bangladesh in the early 1990s, 230,000 have already 
returned.  Only 22,000 remain in Bangladesh and while 
approximately 1,000 were still returning each year, that was 
less than annual camp births and not enough to reduce the 
refugee population.  Of the remaining refugees, only about 
7,000 had been cleared by Burma for repatriation, but, even 
among those, not all were ready to return.  Some had 
protection problems; others had a variety of family or 
economic reasons for refusing repatriation. 
 
4. (C) In any case, UNHCR had tried to work out arrangements 
to allow the remaining refugees to establish a new 
\"self-sustaining capacity\" in Bangladesh, pending 
repatriation to Burma.  They had presented this plan to 
Bangladesh\'s Foreign Secretary in January, but, since the 
plan involved refugees working within the local economy, the 
Foreign Secretary rejected the program as a cover for local 
resettlement of the refugees.  This left UNHCR with few 
options, according to Mise.  Hence the decision to close the 
camps. 
 
5. (C) Mise emphasized that at least the June 30 deadline was 
not hard and fast.  If refugees wanted to return to Burma 
after that date, UNHCR would most likely provide some 
assistance.  It had also opened a dialogue with other UN 
agencies to ensure there was support for the refugees who 
remained behind in Bangladesh after December 31, 2003. 
 
6. (C) Mise also said that he believed that the Government of 
Bangladesh was looking for a way to put the refugee problem 
behind them.  Burmese contacts had told him that the 
Bangladeshis had scarcely raised the refugee issue during 
Than Shwe\'s December visit.  Bangladesh\'s State Minister for 
Foreign Affairs had also told him unofficially that 
Bangladesh could not grant the remaining refugees asylum, for 
fear of becoming a target country for other refugees, but was 
looking for another way out -- \"a discreet solution to the 
problem.\"   In that context, UNHCR\'s approach, by taking the 
burden of decision off the Bangladeshis, could work. 
 
Comment 
 
7. (C) UNHCR may be right in this case.  We have heard the 
same comments from Burmese sources about fading Bangladesh 
government interest in the refugee question.  Nevertheless, 
the BDG does need a way out and UNHCR, by acting 
unilaterally, may allow the BDG to avoid responsibility for 
the decision while still accepting the fait accompli. 
 
8. (C) That said, there may be problems.  According to 
UNHCR\'s Resident Representative in Rangoon, there are 
probably 3,000 to 5,000 refugees still in camps in Bangladesh 
that have legitimate protection problems and a legitimate 
fear of political persecution, should they return to Burma. 
What happens to those individuals if they find themselves 
unable to support themselves in Bangladesh?  Secondly, the 
entire Rohingya Muslim community in Northern Rakhine State 
remains under intense military, political, and social 
pressure.  UNHCR, through its protection services, has been 
able to deflect some of these pressures.  However, there is 
really no one to replace UNHCR, if it pulls out.  Efforts to 
establish development programs in northern Rakhine State 
under the auspices of other UN agencies (e.g., through the 
Basic Needs Assessment Program in 2000 and 2001) have made 
little progress.  More importantly, however, UNHCR is the 
only UN agency that has maintained a consistent focus on 
human rights in its operations.  All others have shied from 
the issue.  Its exit, consequently, may leave the Rohingya 
Muslim population unprotected and raise the risks of a new 
exodus.  That does not necessarily have to be the result, but 
Post strongly suggests the USG discuss with the United 
Nations and other interested parties alternate protection 
arrangements that could substitute for UNHCR\'s operations in 
northern Rakhine State.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S TOURIST SECTOR: LIES, DAMN LIES, AND 
STATISTICS 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Can there really have been 500,000 foreign 
tourists, including 15,000 Americans, in Burma last year? 
Despite the GOB\'s triumphant claims, we think not.  Evidence 
from the local tourism industry, the Embassy\'s Consular 
Section, and a measure of plain common sense, suggest a much 
smaller number of U.S. tourists.  End summary. 
 
Americans Flocking to Burma? 
 
2. (U) The Burmese Ministry of Hotels and Tourism (MOHT) 
recently trumpeted a victory for the 2002 tourist season. 
The country, so the Ministry claimed, finally achieved the 
long sought after goal of 500,000 foreign visitors.  Because 
of severe shortages of flight capacity, and the very limited 
tourist season, we are dubious of the overall numbers. 
However, even if we take them at face value they are not as 
impressive as they initially seem.  According to MOHT 
accounts, there were 270,000 entries by travelers from China, 
Thailand, Laos, and India who crossed the border by land for 
a day or two.  Of the remaining 230,000 visitors, 218,000 
came by air from other Asian countries (including 23,000 from 
Taiwan and 21,000 from Japan). 
 
3. (U) The Ministry also took much pleasure in announcing an 
alleged increase in U.S. visitors to Burma.  One of the 
regime\'s newspapers, The Myanmar Times, reported, 
\"Surprisingly give (sic) the U.S. Government\'s harsh stance 
on Myanmar; it was American tourists who visited most 
frequently from the western nations\" (about 14,500 entries in 
2002 according to the MOHT).  Though this number is still 
less than 3 percent of all purported visitors to Burma, it 
would indicate a sharp increase in U.S. tourism to Burma over 
the last three years. 
 
Wishful Thinking 
 
4. (SBU) Though we have no way to conclusively verify or 
disprove the MOHT\'s claims, we are very skeptical.  Tourism 
from Europe may have increased, due to expanded flight 
capacity in 2002 from Italy and Austria.  However, tourism 
industry sources here say that the Burmese government has 
been known to inflate the number of western tourist entries 
for reasons of national pride and in order to bolster claims 
of respectability.  Another possibility is that the MOHT 
statistics were taken wholesale from the Immigration Service 
with no effort to break them down by the visitors\' status or 
length of stay.  Therefore U.S. passport holders who are 
long-term residents of Burma would be counted as one 
\"visitor\" each time they re-entered the country. 
 
5. (SBU) The Embassy\'s consular statistics tend to bear out 
these assumptions.  Only a couple of hundred U.S. citizens 
registered at the Embassy in 2002 (a small percentage of the 
alleged 14,500 at a time when U.S. travelers are eager to 
register when they travel abroad).  In 2002 there was only a 
single death of a U.S. citizen tourist, no arrests of U.S. 
tourists, about 20 welfare/whereabouts cases involving 
short-term U.S. visitors, and only four U.S. tourists seeking 
a replacement passport.  If the 14,500 number were accurate, 
these low consular data would make Burma a statistical 
anomaly in the consular world. 
 
How Many Then? 
 
6. (SBU) The accurate number of U.S. tourists, and overall 
visitors to Burma, is impossible to know.  For evacuation 
purposes, the Embassy recently made a very generous estimate 
of 10,000 U.S. tourists in Burma during 2002.  Anecdotal 
evidence from hoteliers and travel agents in Rangoon suggests 
an even lower figure of around 7,000 or 8,000.  Whatever the 
true number of tourists, it is even less important than the 
small number the GOB claims.  In any case, the plain fact is 
that U.S. tourism contributes very little to the Burmese 
economy.

1. (C) Summary: The SPDC\'s recent trips to India, China, and 
Bangladesh, together with its exchanges with Thailand, are 
intended to shore up regional support for Burma in 
anticipation of a possible deterioration in Burma\'s relations 
with the West. According to the Director of MFA\'s Southwest 
and Southwest Asia Division, recent visits to India and 
Bangladesh, in particular, focused on infrastructure links, 
and trade and investment.  Reportedly, Burmese Foreign 
Minister Win Aung came back from India with a $25 million 
soft loan, among other promises. End Summary. 
 
India 
 
2. (C) U Ye Myint, the Director of South and Southwest Asia 
Affairs in Burma\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told poloff 
on February 4 that Foreign Minister Win Aung\'s January 19 - 
23 trip to India was not intended to reassure India regarding 
Burma\'s ties with China.  While Win Aung\'s trip immediately 
followed SPDC Chairman Than Shwe\'s trip to China, it was part 
of an effort to shore up Burma\'s regional relations in 
anticipation of a deterioration in relations with the West. 
Right now, no regional states support Western sanctions on 
Burma and the SPDC, with its flurry of recent visits, wanted 
to make sure that there was no change in the position of 
front-line states.  Than Shwe visited Bangladesh and China, 
Win Aung visited India, and Thailand\'s Prime Minister was 
shortly expected in Rangoon.  In each case, the focus of the 
visit had been, or would be, economic cooperation. 
 
3. (C) In India, Win Aung visited New Delhi, Banglaore and 
Calcutta.  In New Delhi, he met with the Vice President, 
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Bajpayee, Finance Minister (and 
former Foreign Minister) Jaswant Singh, and the new Foreign 
Minister Yaswant Sinha; in Bangalore, he met Hyderabad\'s 
Chief Minister and, in Calcutta, had meetings with the Indian 
and Burmese business communities.  Reportedly, the 
discussions produced a $25 million \"soft\" loan from India and 
an invitation to India\'s Vice President to reciprocate 
General Maung Aye\'s year 2000 visit to India.  They also 
reviewed progress on a number of infrastructure projects, 
including the trans-Burma highway, which is to run from Tamu 
on the Indian border to Myawaddy on the Thai border; the 
Kaladan Road and River network which is to lead down from 
Mizoram to Sittwe; and the proposed Tamanthi Hydropower plant 
on the Chindwin River.  According to U Ye Myint, all three 
projects are still in the study stage.  A technical team from 
India is due later this month to decide on the \"alignment\" 
(i.e., route) for the trans-Burma highway; a second team is 
completing studies on the Kaladan River and on enlargement of 
the port at Sittwe (to allow it to take vessels of up to 
6,000 tons); while a third is gathering data for the proposed 
1,000 megawatt plant at Tamanthi.  Hyderabad\'s Chief Minister 
also promised cooperation on IT development, while a private 
Indian business group (not further identified) floated the 
idea of a joint venture investment in a zinc and tin mine in 
Burma. 
 
4. (C) Win Aung also reviewed the bidding on other issues, 
including border control, India\'s interest in ASEAN, and the 
development of BIMSTEC.  In regard to border control, Win 
Aung reiterated Burma\'s interest in cooperation with India in 
controlling insurgents, but ruled out joint patrols. 
According to U Ye Myint, this refusal of joint patrols was a 
long held position which was intended to avoid any 
concessions on sovereignty that other neighbors might 
exploit.  Over time, he said, India had come to understand 
and accept that position.  On ASEAN, U Ye Myint said, Burma 
promised to support India\'s interest in closer cooperation 
and closer ties.  It also reiterated its intent to play an 
\"active role\" in BIMSTEC 
 
Bangladesh 
 
5. (C) Than Shwe\'s December visit to Bangladesh went equally 
well.  According to U Ye Myint, Bangladesh recently adopted 
its own \"Look Eastward\" policy.  Just as India re-assessed it 
relations with Burma when it saw Chinese/Burmese cooperation 
on the rise, so Bangladesh has done the same as it has 
watched Burmese/Indian relations improve.  During the recent 
visit, he said, the BDG said almost nothing about the 
problems of the Rohingya Muslims and refugee repatriation. 
The focus was almost entirely on trade, investment, and 
infrastructure links.  The BDG was interested in a road link 
from Dhaka through Burma and eventually onward to Thailand, 
shipping links between Chittagong, Rangoon and other coastal 
ports, improved border trade arrangments, and a new trade 
settlement arrangement that would facilitate bilateral trade. 
 The GOB had no intrinsic objections to any of the proposals, 
U Ye Myint said, but had not yet responded formally to any. 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C) U Ye Myint\'s explanation of the SPDC\'s recent travels 
rings true.  The GOB appreciates the support it has received 
from neighboring states in bringing to a close many of its 
long running insurgencies, and in dealing with other common 
problems, like narcotics.  It also values the cushion that 
regional states have provided against the impact of Western 
sanctions.  We also note a report in the anti-regime 
Democratic Voice of Burma of January 28 attributed to the 
SPDC\'s Lt. Gen. Soe Win, in which the general \"guaranteed 
that there would be no military intervention against Burma by 
the American government...as Burma is friendly with China, 
this kind of scenario could be protected against.\"  If the 
DVB quote is accurate, it suggests that the GOB now believes 
that it can rely on regional support not only in dealing with 
common problems (like refugees, narcotics, and regional 
development), but also the West.  Some foreign observers 
still characterize Burma\'s military regime as xenophobic, but 
the SPDC found out long ago that its interests are better 
served by engagement, at least with near neighbors, than by 
any effort to keep the world at a distance.  That, in fact, 
was one of the major changes that took place when the current 
crew of generals replaced Ne Win back in 1988.  End Comment.

1. (SBU)  Summary:  The State Peace and Development Council 
(SPDC)  announced on February 1 the selection of a new 
\"Secretary 2\" and the rotation, including two retirements, of 
several regime ministers.  The outgoing ministers won\'t be 
missed.  The incoming Secretary 2 may eventually establish 
himself as a successor to Secretary 1.  End Summary. 
 
A New Secretary 2 - Lt. Gen. Soe Win 
 
2. (C)  On February 1, the SPDC announced that Lt. General 
Soe Win had been assigned as Secretary 2 in the junta.  The 
Secretary 2 post (the fourth most senior position in the 
 
SIPDIS 
junta) had been vacant since February 2001, when Lt. General 
Tin Oo was killed in a helicopter accident.  Soe Win, who is 
approximately 50, worked his way up through various military 
commands before being promoted to Brigadier General in 1996 
as Commander of the North-West Region.  In 1997, he became a 
member of the junta during its transition from the State Law 
and Order Committee (SLORC) to the SPDC.  In November 2001, 
he was promoted to Air Defense Commander.  He also serves as 
one of the Patrons of the Union Solidarity and Development 
Association (USDA), a mass organization used as a base of 
political support by the SPDC. 
 
3. (C)  Lt. General Soe Win is not very well known, and 
appears to have made his name through allegiance and dutiful 
service rather than exceptional performance.  The North-West 
Command is SPDC Vice Chairman Maung Aye\'s home turf and it is 
believed that Soe Win is closer to the military side of the 
junta (General Maung Aye) than to the intelligence side 
(General Khin Nyunt).  Ultimately, of course, all are 
currently under the firm hand of Senior General Than Shwe. 
 
4. (C)  In late January, Soe Win was in the press for the 
first time since his promotion in 2001.  The Democratic Voice 
of Burma reported that he told a USDA meeting in Pyay that 
the SPDC would not talk to or hand over power to the NLD. 
According to the DVB, he urged the gathered USDA members and 
civil servants to not have any contact with the NLD and to 
continue in their service to the country. 
 
New Ministers 
 
5. (C)  Effective February 2, the SPDC also retired Minister 
of Health Major General Ket Sein and Minister of Finance and 
Revenue U Khin Maung Thein and transferred Minister of Rail 
Transportation U Pan Aung to the Prime Minister\'s Office. 
Major General Aung Min replaced U Pan Aung as Minister of 
Rail Transportation.  Major General Aung Min is married to 
the sister of the newly installed Minister for Economic 
Planning and Economic Development, U Soe Tha, who in turn is 
reportedly close to Than Shwe.  This family connection may 
partly explain the change. 
 
6. (C)  The new Minister of Health, Dr. Kyaw Myint, is a 
physician who has served as a Deputy Minister and a Director 
General in the Ministry of Health.  He is well regarded by 
NGOs and UN officials here and served as Chairman of the WHO 
Executive Board in Geneva last year.  His main qualification 
for the minister\'s position, however, is that he has served 
as personal physician to Senior General Than Shwe and his 
family.  We have no information available yet on the new 
Minister of Finance and Revenue, Major General Hla Tun. 
 
7. (C)  The SPDC also announced on February 2 that it was 
increasing the number of Deputy Chief Justices from two to 
three and the number of Supreme Court Justices from eight to 
twelve.  According to the GoB, an interest in \"smooth and 
speedy administration of justice in the interest of the 
people...\" lay behind the additional appointments.  In the 
Attorney General\'s office the number of Deputy Attorneys 
General was increased from one to three. 
 
Comment 
 
8. (C)  As usual, it is not clear what lies behind all these 
changes, but a couple of general points can be made.  First, 
these promotions and retirements are standard practice as the 
SPDC has frequently rotated senior military officers among 
the 93 SPDC, minister, or deputy minister positions. 
Meanwhile, the NLD and other political parties have largely 
maintained the leadership structures that were in place at 
the time of the 1990 election.  As a result, the generational 
contrast between leadership in the SPDC and that in the 
opposition parties (most of whom are Ne Win contemporaries) 
is becoming increasingly stark. 
 
9. (C)  Secondly, the appointment of a new Secretary 2 gives 
Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt two potential successors - Major 
 
SIPDIS 
General Kyaw Win at military intelligence and Lt. General Soe 
Win at the SPDC.  If he is now sidelined, the powers he holds 
could well be split. 
 
10. (C)  As for the ministers, neither the outgoing Minister 
of Finance nor the departing Minister of Health is going to 
be missed.  Both presided over institutions that were 
national disgraces.  The Ministry of Finance, through its 
inability to manage the budget was the prime culprit in the 
inflationary surge that has threatened to overwhelm Burma\'s 
economy over the past two years, while the Ministry of 
Health\'s management of the health system earned Burma the 
booby prize in the WHO\'s ranking of national health systems 
in 1999.  The new appointees may do no better but the 
incumbents were proved failures. 
 
11. (C)  Finally, the additional justices, deputy justices 
and deputy attorneys general may reflect some incipient 
interest in law reform and the use of legal processes in 
Burma.  This does not mean, of course, that the regime will 
not always get its way, but it does mean they may become a 
little more adept in moving the case load now burdening the 
courts, and in finding the appropriate legal pretext for its 
moves.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: Burma may have found a patch for its energy 
problems in 2003.  A slower decline at the aging A\'Pyauk gas 
fields (about 50 miles north northwest of Rangoon), 
unexpectedly large finds of gas in the recently developed 
Nyaungdon field (about 20 miles northwest of the capital), 
and better than expected performance by the pipeline from 
Kanbauk (in Tanintharyi Division) to Hpa\'an (in Kayah State) 
and Rangoon, apparently have lifted supplies of gas in lower 
Burma from 114 mcfd in early 2002 to perhaps as much as 178 
mcfd by the end of February 2003.  Some of these numbers are 
still soft, but, the overall supply of gas and electricity 
should be better (and perhaps far better) in Rangoon in 2003 
than it was in 2002.  There may also be some substantial 
savings of foreign exchange (perhaps as much as $100 million) 
on anticipated oil imports that now will not be required. 
Longer term (meaning 2004), the GOB is banking on hydropower 
to meet its energy needs.  By the end of 2003, the Ministry 
of Electric Power hopes to have an additional 355 megawatts 
of hydropower generating capacity on line, as well as a new 
125-megawatt coal-fired plant. If successful, that could 
produce the first balance between electricity supply and 
demand in Burma that anyone has seen for many years. However, 
it is still too soon to declare Burma\'s energy crisis over. 
If the new found gas gives out before the GOB can bring on 
line its planned hydropower plants, Burma could find itself 
saddled in late 2003 and early 2004 with the same sort of 
shortages that plagued life here in 2002. End summary. 
 
The GOB\'s Got Gas... 
 
2. (C) Burma may not face the same problems with electricity 
supplies during the dry season of 2003 as it did in 2002. 
When we reviewed Burma\'s energy balance last year, the 
situation looked grim (see Ref B).  Nationwide demand for 
natural gas stood at 234 million cubic feet per day (mcfd), 
while supplies were estimated at only about 114 mcfd because 
of the rapid decline in production in the A\'pyauk fields, 
which had always provided the vast majority of Burma\'s 
onshore gas.  The net result was that gas supplies were not 
even sufficient to meet the demands of Burma\'s gas-fired 
electricity generating facilities, much less that of the 
country\'s urea, methanol, steel, and other plants.  The GOB, 
as a result, was obliged to shut down a good portion of its 
industrial capacity and convert a number of its gas-fired 
generating plants to diesel.  Even so, day-to-day electricity 
generating capacity dropped to between 550 and 600 megawatts 
during the dry season of 2002; i.e., to only 65 to 70 percent 
of Burma\'s estimated 800 to 840 megawatt demand.  Blackouts 
and brownouts became the rule throughout lower Burma, 
including Rangoon. 
 
3. (C) Since then, however, the GOB appears to have hit a 
stretch of luck.  While production at the A\'pyauk fields 
continues to decline, from 116 mcfd in 1998 to about 35 mcfd 
today, the GOB\'s development of the Nyaungdon field has gone 
far better than anyone predicted.  Late last year, that field 
was producing only about 25 mcfd.  This year, according to 
government press releases, new discoveries have pushed 
production at Nyaungdon\'s 14 wells to more than 60 mcfd. 
According to Ministry of Electric Power planners, GOB workers 
are working overtime to replace the current 8-inch pipeline 
with one sufficient to carry the larger flow.  Reportedly, 
that new, larger capacity pipeline should be ready by the end 
of February. 
 
4. (C) At the same time, the pipeline which the government 
installed to carry gas from the Yadana export pipeline at 
Kanbauk to Hpa\'an (later extended to Rangoon) has apparently 
performed far better than expected.  When the pipeline was 
first completed in 2001, most western experts judged it would 
never carry more than 10 to 20 mcfd, given its poor quality 
and contract terms which guaranteed only 20 mcfd to the 
government.  However, the Ministries of Energy and Electric 
Power now claim that they are pushing 50 mcfd through the 
pipeline -- more than enough to meet the demand of the new 
cement plant at Hpa\'an while still leaving supplies for 
Rangoon\'s electricity facilities. 
5. (C) The net result of these developments is that Burma 
could have 60 mcfd to 70 mcfd of additional gas over and 
above levels in early 2002, even after allowing for the 
decline in production in the A\'pyauk field.  In fact, 
assuming the best-case scenario, the GOB could have available 
as much as 178 mcfd of natural gas (128 mcfd being the total 
onshore production of gas from all fields including A\'Pyauk 
and Nyaungdon, plus 50 mcfd from offshore) -- a level not 
seen since 1998. 
 
...But Will the Juice Flow? 
 
6. (C) Of course, it remains to be seen how real and how 
sustainable these increased supplies will prove to be.  The 
full 60 mcfd of gas from Nyaungdon has yet to arrive in 
Rangoon.  Furthermore, the Nyaungdon field in particular 
appears to have been developed entirely with a focus on the 
economy\'s short-term needs, without any attention to 
sustainability.  If the development program has been too 
aggressive, then that field too could peter out (as the 
A\'pyauk field has) far sooner than the GOB now expects. 
 
7. (C) In the case of the Kanbauk-Hpa\'an-Rangoon pipeline, 
there are two issues: contract terms and durability.  The GOB 
may now be drawing more than the 20 mcfd it is entitled to 
under its contract.  However, if it is, it is probably 
because of a short-term quirk in the system.  It is possible 
that Thailand cannot, for technical reasons, use all of the 
pre-paid gas that it has available in the stock it has built 
up under its \"take or pay\" contracts.  Producers in the 
second major offshore gas field, Yetagun, may also not yet be 
ready to use their full share of the pipeline\'s capacity.  If 
not, this may allow for additional gas to be pumped, from the 
Yadana field, for Burmese consumption.  In either case, Burma 
could shortly find itself squeezed back to the 20 mcfd to 
which it is actually entitled, as Thai drawings increase 
and/or Yetagun production comes up to full capacity.   As for 
durability, the pipeline was not built to the highest 
standards.  In fact, the most common prediction at the time 
it was completed was that it would blow up or blow out every 
time it was filled.  That, in fact, was the result during its 
first weeks of operation.  Since then, it has settled down, 
but there is still the risk that an accident will take the 
pipeline down for several weeks or months. 
 
8. (C) Nevertheless, the bottom line now is that the lights 
are on in Rangoon and they could stay on throughout the dry 
season, if the augmented supplies of gas can be sustained. 
Since October, there have been occasional outages, but we 
have not had anything like the rolling blackouts that plagued 
Rangoon during 2002\'s dry season.  Equally importantly, if 
the GOB has been able to bring an additional 60 to 70 mcfd of 
gas on-line since early 2002, there will be major savings of 
foreign exchange.  Each 22 mcfd of gas effectively translates 
into 1 million barrels per year of diesel fuel.  At current 
prices, consequently, an additional supply of 65 mcfd of gas 
would mean potential savings of up to 3 million barrels per 
year of diesel worth approximately $100 million - $120 
million.  It would also mean less downward pressure on the 
kyat, which at 1100 kyat/dollar, is still running well above 
the 1200 to 1400 kyat/dollar rate that we predicted for the 
end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003. 
 
I\'ve Got One Word For You: Hydropower 
 
9. (C) The Ministry of Electric Power asserts that the 
long-term solution to all these uncertainties and stop-gap 
solutions is hydropower.  According to the Ministry\'s 
Director General for Planning, there is now 390 mw of 
installed hydropower capacity in Burma, but this is only 
about 1 percent of Burma\'s estimated potential.  In its most 
recent 5-year plan, the GOB set the ambitious goal of 
installing an additional 2000 mw of hydropower capacity by 
2006 (pie in the sky at best).  Unlike many older hydropower 
plants, which are located in remote border or mountainous 
areas, many of the new plants are to be constructed in river 
valleys closer to the main power grids around Mandalay and 
Rangoon.  Mini-hydropower and other small plants will also be 
built to electrify more rural areas. 
10. (C) The DG admitted that for the next two years, the 
objective is to patch as quickly as possible current energy 
shortages.  Thus, planners hope that by the end of 2003 the 
Ministry\'s Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE) will have 
completed two hydropower plants with a combined 355-mw 
capacity (the Paunglaung dam in southern Mandalay Division 
with 280 mw, and the Mone dam in central Magway Division with 
75 mw).  They also hope to bring on line one coal-fired 
thermal plant with 125-mw capacity.  This additional 
capacity, once plugged into the grid could make up the 
current deficit in power production in lower Burma, while 
replacing imports of diesel, and reducing the GOB\'s exposure 
to gas supplies.  By 2005, the planners estimate, the new 
hydropower capacity should be well ahead of total demand, 
allowing strategists to ponder longer-term energy plans. 
 
Comment 
 
11. (SBU) If all goes as planned, for the next several months 
at least supplies of gas and electricity to the capital 
should top the levels available in 2002.  If the planned 
hydropower is actually installed and available as predicted, 
then this additional gas supply may in fact bridge the gap. 
 
12. (C) Of course, there will still be a case for the 
construction of a major pipeline to bring Burma\'s offshore 
gas onshore for domestic use, if only to fuel now idled 
industrial facilities.  However, accessing that gas will not 
be the sort of critical political event that finding supplies 
of fuel was this year.  Had the citizens of Rangoon had to 
spend one more season in the dark with living standards 
undermined by a rapidly depreciating kyat, this government 
truly could have been in trouble.  Even now, it\'s not secure, 
but with the energy situation now apparently under control, 
at least to some degree, it may have more breathing space 
than we anticipated several months ago.

SUBJECT: A NEW WAVE OF POLITICAL ARRESTS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C)  Reuters reported on February 10 that the regime had 
arrested 12 opposition activists for plotting to create 
unrest in Burma.  The report did not provide many details on 
the arrests but it did note that 7 low-level members of the 
National League for Democracy (NLD) members and the Secretary 
General of the Shan National League for Democracy (SNLD), Sai 
Nyunt Lwin, were among those arrested. 
 
2. (C)  By late afternoon on February 10, NLD Secretary U 
Lwin told Poloff that the regime\'s internal security branch, 
Military Intelligence (MI), had alerted him to only two 
recent arrests of NLD members, both on February 6.  He said 
that earlier on February 10, MI had contacted him again to 
say that one of these members had been released but that the 
other, Khin Win from Kamayut township in Rangoon, was going 
to be charged with conspiring with exile groups against the 
State.  U Lwin said MI had not mentioned the additional 
arrests reported by Reuters but he had heard on Radio Free 
Asia that there had been 20 new political arrests. 
 
3. (C)  During the meeting with U Lwin, reports came in of 4 
more NLD members arrested that day in Rangoon townships. 
Two, Thein Gyi and Thaung Gyi, were regular party members, 
while two others, Tun Nyin and Tin Htut, were township NLD 
secretaries.  Tin Htut was arrested just minutes before, when 
 
SIPDIS 
he and another NLD member were walking to the headquarters 
office.  The companion told Poloff that MI did not state why 
Tin Htut was being arrested and warned the companion that it 
was no concern of his.  (Note:  Later, NLD headquarters 
contacted the Embassy to report that Tin Htut had been 
released; MI had apparently arrested the wrong person.  End 
Note) 
 
4. (C)  DCM met with SNLD Chairman Khun Htun Oo, who said 
that the party\'s General Secretary (who was arrested on 
February 7, which happens to be Shan State Day) was still 
under arrest.  KHO said he had spoken to MI and was told that 
there had been 14 arrests, 7 NLD and 7 others.  Among the 
others were the General Secretary\'s nephew (who had since 
been released), students, fortune tellers and people involved 
in the informal banking sector.  The reason for the arrests 
according to KHO\'s MI contact was a plot by students to 
collaborate more closely with monks.  There was supposedly 
approximately USD 1,500 associated with this \"plot.\" 
 
5. (C)  Comments:  While the details of these new political 
arrests are obviously still sketchy, it appears that there is 
a new crackdown underway against political activists.  The 
final number of arrests and the junta\'s reasons for the 
arrests should be clarified over the next few days.  End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: JAPANESE VIEWS OF RAZALI\'S MISSION 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: According to Japanese Embassy sources in 
Rangoon, at the upcoming UN meetings in Tokyo, Japan will 
argue that the current sanctions-based western approach to 
Burma has failed and should be revised to allow for a more 
gradual process of transition, more direct aid support and 
more dialogue with regional states regarding the implications 
of change in Burma.  The Japanese Ambassador to Burma, Yuji 
Miyamoto, has taken the lead on formulating this approach and 
will likely be the prime GOJ spokesman at the meetings.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) The GOJ believes that the Razali process will have to 
be reformulated before it can make any further progress in 
Burma.  According to the Japanese Embassy\'s Political 
Counselor, Rokuichiro Michii, the GOJ, led by Ambassador 
Miyamoto, has reached a number of conclusions in recent 
weeks.  First, the GOJ believes that Than Shwe has emerged as 
the single important decision-maker in the GOB; \"everything,\" 
according to Michii, \"centered on him.\"  Secondly, there was 
now little pressure for change in Burma.  While Burma\'s 
economic situation was problematic, the problems were not 
serious enough to force change.  Similarly, Western ties with 
Burma were now minimal and Western sanctions ineffectual, 
given the absolute absence of front line state support for 
sanctions.  India, China, Thailand and all other regional 
states were now all engaged with the GOB, Michii noted; none 
were prepared to put their relations with Burma at risk for 
the sake of political change.  On the contrary, all now 
effectively provided a cushion of support for the GOB in the 
face of western sanctions. 
 
3. (C) The GOJ also believed that no confidence had been 
re-established between the GOB and the NLD, despite two years 
of talks. While the SPDC had made \"tactical concessions,\" 
there were \"no incentives\" for it to change, Michii said. 
Meanwhile, there were many \"risks\" to embarking on a course 
of political change while active insurgencies continued in 
the countryside.  As for the NLD, it too feared to 
compromise, acording to Michii.  Aung San Suu Kyi\'s release 
in May had created high expectations, which could backfire on 
the party if the NLD settled for anything less than a full 
participatory democracy.  On the other hand, the NLD also 
knew the risks of trying to force the pace of change.  In 
1990 and 1998, it had been the victim of government 
crackdowns and did not want to go that route again.  Hence, 
it had settled for an ineffectual middle course -- demanding 
change, but doing nothing directly to press the government 
towards change. 
 
The Problems 
 
4. (C) As for UN Special Envoy Razali, Micchi said, Japan 
supported him and his efforts.  It also believed that 
Razali\'s \"facilitation\" had produced some results; e.g., the 
release of political prisoners and some additional political 
space for the NLD.  However, there were problems with the 
current process.  First of all, Razali did not enjoy full 
international support.  By and large, regional states, 
including front line states like India, China and Thailand, 
viewed Razali\'s mission as a western initiative meant to 
serve western interests in human rights even at the expense 
of issues of high interest to regional states like narcotics 
control, refugees, and regional development.  Those states 
might give lip service to Razali\'s efforts, but none were 
prepared to sacrifice their relations with Burma for the sake 
of his program.  Secondly, Razali had set his sights too 
high, according to Michii.  Given adequate incentives, the 
GOB might sign on for some process leading to a \"guided 
democracy;\" however, it would not accept the full 
participatory democracy that the West, following the NLD, was 
now demanding.  Finally, the GOJ felt that the international 
community had used only \"sticks and no carrots\" in dealing 
with the SPDC.  It had not toned down its rhetoric and had 
not delivered on promises of support even for humanitarian 
issues. 
Japanese Proposals 
 
5. (C) To deal with these problems, the GOJ plans to 
recommend in Tokyo that the international community take 
steps to make Razali\'s mission relevant to, or at least 
compatible with, regional interests.  In its view, if we 
continue as we are today, with western states headed in one 
direction and regional states in another, then the chances 
for any succesful internationally led effort at change will 
be small.  Secondly, the Japanese will argue that the West 
should be realistic regarding its expectations for change. 
The NLD might be constrained regarding the types of change it 
could advocate, but the West need not remain locked in that 
same box.  If a slower, but ultimately more promising process 
could be worked out, then that is the direction in which we 
should move with or without an explicit endorsement from the 
NLD.  Finally, if the West truly wanted the Razali process to 
work, it had to be more generous, Michii said.  Right now, 
the west was advocating radical change without providing any 
restructuring support.  Not unreasonably, the GOB and most 
regional governments questioned the wisdom of that approach 
in a country with such deeply-rooted problems. 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C) The analysis above is not new, but it is accurate. 
There is little pressure for change or inclination towards 
compromise in Burma now.  The economy is faltering, but not 
so badly as to completely undermine the government\'s hold on 
power.  Western sanctions hurt, but not enough to threaten 
the government.  Meanwhile, those same sanctions alienate 
regional states, who feel that the West has placed its 
interest in human rights before their interest in regional 
stability and regional development.  As a result, the West 
has ended up trying to run a blockade without front-line 
state support.  Not surprisingly, that approach has failed. 
 
7. (C) Whether anything else is possible is the real 
question.  The prescription the Japanese plan to offer fits 
the diagnosis, but they will need the bedside manner of 
saints to make that prescription go down with Western 
governments.  More dialogue with regional states regarding 
the regional implications of change in Burma, more realistic 
goals for the process of transition and more direct aid 
support for change could all help the transition process. 
When all is said and done, however, the GOJ will essentially 
be asking the West to distinguish its political goals from 
those of the Burmese domestic political opposition led by 
Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD.  The Japanese may be right in 
arguing that the NLD is trapped by the current configuration 
of political forces into taking a maximalist position. 
Unfortunately, they may find that the West as a whole is in 
exactly the same position. 
 
8. (C) In any case,  USG representatives should be prepared 
to react to the Japanese analysis and presentation in Tokyo. 
From what we understand, this position has been well vetted 
within the GOJ and could determine Japanese policy in Burma 
for some time to come, regardless of any decisions taken at 
the coming meeting.  End Comment.

REF: RANGOON 71 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The UN country team in Burma has painted a 
stark picture of the nation\'s humanitarian situation.  It has 
also forecast dire consequences for Burma\'s poor, and for 
regional stability, if the situation is not addressed 
quickly.  The UNDP Resident Representative in Rangoon will 
present the country team\'s findings during the upcoming Tokyo 
meetings.  Resolution of these problems, and the prevention 
of a full-blown crisis, depend first and foremost on a more 
responsible and responsive government.  However, there are 
ways to make marginal improvements and to perhaps delay the 
onset of crisis.  As it has with the fight against HIV/AIDS 
here, the U.S. government should consider contributing to 
this effort.  End summary. 
 
Humanitarian Crisis in the Making 
 
2. (C) During the upcoming Tokyo meetings on Burma, the UNDP 
Resident Representative in Rangoon plans to deliver a dire 
assessment of the humanitarian situation facing Burma.  The 
assessment stems from a recently completed UN report entitled 
\"A Review of the Humanitarian Situation in Myanmar.\" 
According to the report, Burma\'s persistent consumer price 
inflation (estimated by the Embassy at about 60 percent in 
2002, with higher levels for key staples), combined with the 
serious erosion of basic social services (for example, the 
GOB has budgeted only $25,000 for fighting HIV/AIDS), have 
put the country\'s poorest people on the precipice of 
disaster.  The UN report is the first of two volumes; the 
second will include some \"quick impact\" project proposals and 
go into the country-specific problems of delivering and 
monitoring humanitarian assistance in Burma. 
 
3. (C) The results of the malignant combination of inflation 
and poor social services, according to the report, are 
increasing poverty, landlessness, food insecurity, spreading 
disease (especially TB, malaria, and HIV), and a 
deterioration in the country\'s education system.  These 
factors are not felt equally across the country, hitting 
particularly hard ethnic minorities residing in remote border 
areas and peri-urban slum dwellers.  The report recognizes 
rapidly expanding disparities between urban, peri-urban, and 
rural populations. 
 
4. (C) The report also stresses how symptoms combine to 
exacerbate the situation.  Some examples: malnutrition and 
poor food security hamper people\'s ability to fight disease 
and thus earn income; poor access to clean water leads to 
high child and infant mortality; and, a weak education system 
undermines a country\'s economic strength. 
 
5. (C) The UN points out that the impact of Burma\'s 
accelerating humanitarian crisis is also felt well beyond the 
country\'s borders.  It is very disruptive to regional 
stability, and a major obstacle to the international 
community\'s efforts to combat trafficking in persons, 
HIV/AIDS, and other social plagues.  In particular, the 
report illustrates in detail the connection between poverty, 
malnutrition, and slipping educational standards, on the one 
hand, and narcotics production and use, the AIDS epidemic, 
prostitution, and trafficking in persons. 
 
Who\'s to Blame? 
 
6 (C) The report gives the SPDC the credit and blame it 
deserves.  The UN is justifiably concerned with being too 
harsh on the GOB, but realizes the importance of giving a 
relatively frank assessment to those assembled in Tokyo. 
According to one UN official here, there was much discussion 
in the UN country team regarding how far to go in each 
direction.  Apparently there was concern that traditional 
opponents of the SPDC would use overwhelming criticism of the 
regime as further justification for withholding any 
international assistance that might be used to \"bail the 
government out\" of its predicament. 
 
7. (C) Nonetheless, the final UN report seems to have struck 
a good balance.  The GOB gets credit for improvement of water 
and sanitation facilities, construction of schools, improving 
stability in border regions via ceasefire accords, and 
reducing opium cultivation.  However, the UN makes it clear 
that the GOB\'s actions have not done enough -- for example 
pointing out the lack of well-trained teachers to staff the 
new schools.  In addition, the report, while not specifically 
mentioning the SPDC, asserts that \"humanitarian issues...are 
often an extension of...weaknesses in the policy framework, 
stability, peace and security, the macro-economic 
environment, level and quality of social services, civil 
society participation, and transparency and accountability.\" 
 
How to Stop the Slide 
 
8. (C) The UN report\'s prescription is very straightforward: 
find a way to meet the needs of the people.  This should be 
the first priority for all parties, inside and outside of 
Burma, interested in the future of the country.  The report 
correctly points out that simply ignoring the gorilla in the 
room will not make it go away.  In fact, this policy of 
neglect will only lead to increased regional tensions, 
\"vulnerability and social instability.\" 
 
Comment 
 
9. (C) We agree with the UN\'s assessment, and its blame for 
the situation.  In particular, the UN\'s outline of areas of 
concern is right on target.  Continuing to ignore the 
multitude of very serious social ills in Burma will doom it 
to an ill-fed, under-educated, and unhealthy generation -- 
the generation that could well be called on to rebuild a 
democratic nation.  Admittedly, these problems cannot be 
completely resolved unless the current regime changes its 
priorities.  While the international community cannot carry 
the entire burden in the interim, it can certainly contribute 
to some incremental improvements.  As U.S. AID has found with 
its nascent HIV/AIDS program in Burma, there are 
international NGOs that are able to work quite independently 
of the current regime in areas of critical humanitarian need.

1. (SBU)  Summary:  The National League for Democracy and 
other opposition parties represented by the Committee 
Representing the People\'s Parliament (CRPP) celebrated 
Burma\'s Union Day on February 12 at NLD headquarters.  In 
this first ever CRPP public celebration of a national 
holiday, the growing ranks of the CRPP called on the regime 
to live up to its pledge to enter into dialogue with the 
opposition for political change.  The SPDC also held an event 
commemorating Union Day and stated that the military 
government continues to pursue peace and tranquillity as a 
prerequisite to political change.  The public display of 
ethnic political solidarity at the CRPP event was a high 
point for its members, and a test of the regime\'s toleration 
for dissenting political opinion.  End Summary. 
 
NLD Celebration Brings Out Ethnic Show of Support 
 
2. (SBU) In spite of the regime\'s recent arrests and 
harassment of political activists, members of the Committee 
Representing the People\'s Parliament (CRPP) showed up in 
force on February 12 at National League for Democracy 
headquarters to celebrate Burma\'s Union Day.  NLD and CRPP 
Chairman U Aung Shwe kicked off the event stating that it was 
a CRPP, not NLD, celebration (the CRPP\'s first ever public 
celebration of a national holiday).  Dozens of Members of 
Parliament Elect, most of whom have served months if not 
years in prison for their political activities, were crowded 
into the headquarters building, joined by diplomats including 
the U.S. Charge d\'Affaires, the Ambassadors of Great Britain, 
Italy, and Australia, UN representatives and the press. 
Hundreds of supporters (and a contingent of the regime\'s 
military intelligence) on the street in front of the building 
listened as the words of Aung San Suu Kyi and the leaders of 
several other political parties represented by the CRPP were 
broadcast out from the meeting hall. 
 
2. (SBU)  The speeches by ASSK, the CRPP and leaders of 
specific political parties all carried a common theme:  1) 
the \"union\" of Burmese nationalities engineered by General 
Aung San in 1947 is under siege due to the divisive policies 
of the SPDC and its predecessors; 2) current conditions - the 
lack of human rights, discrimination against ethnic 
nationalities, and economic hardships - are untenable and 
require political change; and 3) the SPDC must follow through 
on its stated commitment to begin political dialogue, the 
only solution to these problems.  While this is the standard 
refrain for the NLD, it is significant that, through the 
CRPP, a broader coalition of political representatives are 
now able to make the appeal in public. 
 
3. (SBU)  For the record, CRPP membership has continued to 
expand over the past few months and now includes 
representatives of the following parties that won seats in 
the 1990 elections: the NLD, the Shan NLD, the Union Pa-o 
National Organization, the Arakan League for Democracy, the 
Zomi League for Democracy, the Democratic Party, the Party 
for National Democracy, the National Democratic Party for 
Human Rights, the Kamans NLD, the Mon National Democratic 
Front, and two independent MP\'s-elect.  Only the first three 
of these parties are still legally registered, the rest were 
deregistered by the regime shortly after the elections and 
have since been considered \"illegal.\" 
 
SPDC Event Focuses On More of the Same 
 
4. (SBU) The SPDC celebrated Union Day with a flag ceremony, 
the naming of a white elephant, the positioning of a giant 
alms bowl at the regime pagoda on Mindhamma Hill and a dinner 
for USDA and SPDC officials.  The flag ceremony is a 
tradition handed down from the Ne Win era when a Union of 
Burma flag with the 1947 Panglong Agreement attached in a 
holder was taken to each of the seven states and divisions. 
The SPDC ceremony takes a Union Flag to four points in the 
city (elapsed time approximately 40 minutes) before it is 
raised in front of city hall.  The white elephant is the 
third addition to a white elephant park the regime created 
about two years ago.  The white elephant is a sign of good 
luck and prosperity for the country.  The giant alms bowl was 
fabricated in Mandalay and has been ceremoniously transported 
to Rangoon by the regime, collecting donations at every stop. 
 The placement of the alms bowl at the foot of the regime 
pagoda and alabaster Buddha image at Mindhamma Hill is 
intended to gain merit. 
 
5. (SBU)  In the evening, Senior General Than Shwe hosted a 
reception and dinner at the President\'s Residence Compound 
for SPDC officials, USDA representatives from state and 
divisions, various governmental NGOs, and traditional 
cultural troop members from states and the Tenassarim 
Division.  The press release on the event also notes that 
leaders of national races were in attendance, but it does not 
identify who those leaders were.  The stated objectives of 
the SPDC\'s  Union Day activities were \"for all nationals to 
safeguard the national policy - non-disintegration of the 
Union, non-disintegration of the national solidarity, and 
perpetuation of sovereignty; to keep the Union Spirit alive 
and flourishing among the entire people; for all nationals to 
strive in harmony for the emergence of an enduring State 
constitution that will pave the way for the building of a new 
discipline-flourishing democratic nation and to ward off, 
with national unity, the danger of destructionists from 
inside and outside the nation who are disturbing the 
stability, peace, modernization and development of the 
State.\"  In short, no changes from previous years; stay the 
course and do not make waves. 
 
6. (C)  Comment:  The CRPP\'s public celebration of Union Day 
was a high point for the elected leaders of ethnic parties 
since they were stripped of their positions in 1990.  There 
was a definite air of excitement as these leaders spoke out 
on the injustices their people currently live under and 
called on the regime to work together for political change. 
However, given the regime\'s past actions against the CRPP 
(almost all were arrested in 1998 when the CRPP was formed) 
and recent arrests and harassment of political activists (see 
reftel) this may be a short-lived high.  Nevertheless, the 
SPDC is allowing the CRPP to continue to function at this 
time.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The SPDC presented its evidence against 
political activists arrested over the last month in a 
February 10 press conference.  The activists were allegedly 
conspiring with \"insurgent and terrorist\" groups in Thailand. 
 While one of those arrested was allegedly planning some 
explosions, the rest were reportedly only guilty of 
attempting to distribute leaflets against the regime and 
planning protests.  The regime issued a statement on February 
13 complimenting \"the vast majority\" of political figures in 
the country who are not acting outside the law.  The NLD told 
Emboffs that while it had no specific knowledge of the 
alleged actions of the NLD members among those arrested, it 
did not doubt that they may have connections with exile 
groups.  The arrests obviously serve as a warning that 
political activities are still very closely monitored and 
that any criticism of the regime will be dealt with harshly. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (U)  On February 11, the state-controlled newspaper, \"The 
New Light of Myanmar,\" provided a detailed account of a 
February 10 Ministry of Defense news conference on recent 
arrests of political activists.  The purpose of the news 
conference was to provide information on \"the anti-government 
activities perpetrated by expatriate NLD terrorist insurgents 
and NCGUB in cooperation with some members of the NLD and 
SNLD parties within the country.\"  It also claimed that the 
All Burma Democratic Student Front (ABSDF) played a role in 
the activities. 
 
3. (U)  The evidence presented against the activists was a 
rambling, often incoherent description of trips various 
individuals made between the border area and Rangoon, 
training in insurgent camps in Thailand, transfers of funds, 
Xeroxing of anti-government pamphlets, and \"causing unrest.\" 
The most serious charges, of planning to cause explosions, 
were leveled at a Thet Nwe, alias Nyein Lu, who was 
reportedly sent by the expatriate NLD and ABSDF in Thailand. 
The offenses of the rest of those arrested revolved around 
political organizing activities of a Maung Maung Aye, who was 
reportedly planning to stage two protests in Rangoon in 
April. 
 
4. (U)  In justifying the crackdown, the regime spokesperson 
at the press conference said that \"during the transitional 
period, the government wants to see stable, peaceful and 
disciplined political movement.  Holding the attitudes and 
thoughts of 88, some politicians found weaknesses and faults 
with the government and the Tatmadaw, exaggerated them and 
caused unrest.  It was found that they commited destructive 
acts after contacting with unlawful groups secretly and 
receiving assistance from them.  Such acts are to be 
exposed.\" 
 
5. (U)  On February 13, the SPDC Information Committee issued 
a statement that the regime appreciated \"the vast majority\" 
of political figures in Burma that are working toward 
transition peacefully and by legal means.  Noting that the 
government is laying a foundation of peace and stability and 
ensuring that all 10 political parties in Burma may act 
freely and without interference within the framework of the 
law, it said the government regretted when some members of 
political parties acted in violation of their own party\'s 
regulations and deliberately broke national laws.  It noted 
that \"these individuals will, of course, be tried fairly in a 
court of law, and are considered innocent until proven 
guilty.\" 
 
6. (C)  NLD Spokesperson U Lwin and Aung San Suu Kyi have 
told embassy officers that while the NLD had no direct 
knowledge of the alleged actions of the NLD members 
implicated in the arrests, they did not doubt that the 
charges may be at least partly true.  They said that while 
the NLD tries to maintain tight party discipline precisely to 
avoid any activities the regime may deem illegal, some 
members probably do have contacts with exile groups (in 
itself an illegal act), and may take more risks as a result. 
U Lwin cited an incident about two months ago when military 
intelligence called him complaining bitterly that someone had 
placed NLD flags along the entire length of the historic U 
Bein footbridge near Mandalay (an incident not noted in the 
recent arrests).  U Lwin said he honestly had no idea who had 
done this but he sent word to the Mandalay NLD office that MI 
was threatening to make arrests if there were any additional 
problems.  He said these recent arrests should serve as a 
reminder to those outside the country who criticize the NLD 
for not being more assertive that it takes very little to end 
up in prison. 
 
7. (C)  Comment:  These arrests obviously serve as a warning 
that political activities are still very closely monitored 
and that any criticism of the regime will be dealt with 
harshly.  The NLD continues to maintain a non-confrontational 
profile in hopes of demonstrating to the SPDC that it can and 
will play according to the regime\'s strict rules.  It is a 
difficult line to hold given rapidly deteriorating 
socio-economic conditions, but the alternative would be a 
return to the confrontations, arrests, and attrition of NLD 
members in the 1990\'s. 
8. (C)  Comment Cont\'d:  One worrisome aspect of the February 
13 SPDC information sheet is that it specifies that only the 
10 legal parties may act freely.  Most of the political 
parties in the opposition coalition group, the Committee 
Representing the Peoples\' Parliament (CRPP), were 
deregistered by the regime after the 1990 elections and are 
not included in the 10 legal parties.  Hopefully, the 
information sheet was not meant as a warning of possible 
arrests if these parties continue to participate in the CRPP. 
 End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s expected banking crisis is no longer 
pending; it\'s here.  According to bankers in Rangoon, 
depositors withdrew more than one-quarter of their deposits 
with Burma\'s private banks during the week ending February 
14, following revelations of connections between the private 
banks and a set of unofficial financial institutions which 
collapsed en masse at the end of January.  The banks have 
imposed restrictions on withdrawals and appealed to the 
government through Secretary 1 for support.  Indications are 
that the government will step in with the supply of needed 
liquidity, but, as of close of business February 19, no plan 
commensurate with the problem had yet been announced.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) The long expected crisis in the Burmese banking sector 
(reftels) hit last week.   Martin Pun, the General Manager of 
one of Burma\'s largest private banks (Yoma Bank), told the 
DCM on February 16 that depositors had withdrawn more than a 
quarter of their deposits with Burma\'s private banks during 
the week ending February 14.  According to Pun, a total of 
some 70 billion kyat (about USD 70 million) was withdrawn, 
with 19 billion kyat going out the doors on February 14 
alone.  Hardest hit was Asia Wealth Bank (AWB), the largest 
of Burma\'s private banks.  Over the weekend, private banks 
met and agreed to place concerted limits on all withdrawals. 
Starting February 17, all private banks will allow 
withdrawals of only 500,000 kyat/week from checking and 
savings accounts.  They also appealed to Secretary 1 for 
central bank support and an effective government guarantee of 
all deposits in the private banks.  Reportedly, the 
government has agreed to provide support, but has not yet 
issued a public announcement regarding its plans.  Meanwhile, 
concerns remain as to whether banks will be able to meet the 
public\'s demand for cash as the week goes on. 
 
3. (C) Behind all of these developments was the collapse at 
the end of January of several unofficial financial 
institutions (Arrow, Aye Yar Myay, Ngwe Zone, Kahing Marlar, 
and others) who took loans and deposits against promises of 
returns of 5 to 10 percent/month.  These institutions had 
flourished by investing in real assets during the high 
inflation days of 2001 and 2002, but had been caught out by 
tighter government enforcement of banking rules, the 
stabilization of the kyat over the past 6 months at a rate of 
about 1,100 kyat/dollar, and a flattening out of the asset 
price inflation which had carried them to profits during the 
previous two years.  No longer able to deliver the returns 
they promised, these institutions either folded or, in the 
case of the few that still remain standing, unilaterally 
placed restrictions on payments out. 
 
4.  (C) Unfortunately for the private banks, several of these 
unofficial financial institutions were their clients.  In 
particular, Arrow was affiliated with AWB, and its collapse 
precipitated the run, first on AWB, then on all the private 
banks.  The run started slowly at the beginning of February, 
but rapidly gained momentum, cresting on February 14.  Even 
now there are signs that the panic is not over.  On February 
17 and 18, there were crowds at several banks and others (AWB 
and Myanmar Universal Bank) had effectively closed to the 
public and gone to an appointment system for depositors 
seeking funds.  While there has been no serious violence as 
yet, public frustration is building.  On February 18 and 19, 
in fact, there were reports of stone-throwing at several 
locations. 
 
5. (C) As yet, however, it is still not clear who the public 
will hold responsible for this fiasco.  In some ways, of 
course, the government is obviously to blame.  It created the 
repressed financial system and rip-roaring inflation that set 
the conditions for the growth of the unofficial financial 
institutions that have now collapsed.  It also licensed many 
of those companies, albeit not for banking operations.   In 
addition, it was obviously lax in its supervision of the 
banks, who were allowed to lend freely (and imprudently) to 
companies involved in blatantly illegal operations.  Finally, 
its response to the crisis has left a lot to be desired. 
Even as of close of business on February 18; i.e., three 
weeks after the start of the run, the government had still 
not issued any public statement re-assuring depositors or 
guaranteeing financial support for the banks. 
 
6. (C) That said, the private banks will not escape blame. 
When all is said and done, they did the dirty work.  They 
were the ones who took deposits in good faith and then lent 
those deposits on to companies whose operations were not even 
legal, much less viable in the long term.  They may also be 
the ones who pay the highest price for this fiasco.  If they 
survive at all, they will end up propped up by government 
money and dependent on the government for their continued 
survival.  They may also be obliged to endure much closer 
government supervision of their management of funds, which 
could be embarrassing for many of the private bank managers. 
 
7. (C) It also remains to be seen what impact this crisis 
will have on real output and prices in Burma.  Restricted 
credit should hit both, but if the government steps in to 
meet the liquidity needs of the private banks, we could see a 
sharp fall in the exchange rate (as cash holders move their 
withdrawn funds offshore) and a spike in the inflation rate, 
depending on how quickly and completely the government makes 
up for the banks\' lost deposits.  However, even that effect 
may be muted, if the government trails the rate of 
withdrawals (as it should), forces some banks out of business 
(like AWB) and encourages the rest to clean up their lending 
acts.  Added to this will be the impact of the collapse of 
the unofficial financial institutions whose operations 
assumed huge proportions over the past three years. 
Reportedly, those institutions ran up assets and liabilities 
totaling over 200 billion kyat over the past three years. 
Now, with their collapse, that whole unofficial credit 
creation system will be wiped away.  That alone will have an 
impact on prices and output in Burma, regardless of how well 
or badly the government handles the banking crisis.

REF: RANGOON 213 
 
Classified By: CDA, a.i. Ron McMullen.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s banking crisis has continued to build 
in the absence of government action.  Several private banks 
have effectively closed, while the Myanmar Bankers 
Association has agreed to further reduce the limits on 
withdrawals to only 200,000 kyat (i.e., $200) per account per 
week.  Government banks have continued to operate normally, 
but their deposits represent only a small fraction of the 
entire banking system\'s.  Moreover, even their operations 
have been interrupted to a degree by the problems at the 
private banks.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Burma\'s banking crisis continued unabated on February 
19 in the absence of any effective government response. 
While the Central Bank has reportedly extended emergency 
credits to several banks and brought in several truckloads of 
bills to meet the banks demands for cash, the government 
itself has still not issued any statement regarding its 
intent to support the private banks.  Some of the 
government\'s steps have even been counterproductive.  On 
February 17, the government instructed Myawaddy Bank, which 
is affiliated with the Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited 
(MEHL), to transfer all official government and military 
accounts to the Myanmar Economic Corporation\'s Inwaa Bank. 
This order had nothing to do with the banking crisis; it was 
essentially precipitated by MEHL\'s fall from grace as the 
favored military corporation in country.  Nevertheless, 5 
billion kyat in deposits crossed the street, putting the 
joint venture Myawaddy Bank in trouble along with the private 
banks. 
 
3. (C) As might be expected under these circumstances, lines 
have continued to form in front of all the private banks, 
forcing several to effectively close.  Meanwhile, the Myanmar 
Bankers Association (an unoffical grouping of private 
bankers) agreed on February 18 to further reduce the limit on 
withdrawals from 500,000 to 200,000 kyat (i.e., about $200) 
per account per week.  There are also increasing signs of 
payment problems, in part because some of the steps taken by 
the private banks ostensibly to slow withdrawals (e.g., a ban 
on account transfers even between branches of the same bank). 
 That ban may facilitate controls on withdrawals, but it also 
makes it nearly impossible for any company to do business. 
 
3. (C) Thus far, fortunately, only private banks have been 
affected by the crisis.  Government-owned banks such as 
Myanmar Economic Bank, Myanmar Investment and Commercial 
Bank, and the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank have all continued 
to operate normally without restrictions on withdrawals. 
However, even they have been affected in cases where they 
have to arrange settlements through the private banks.  For 
instance, MFTB regularly redeems foreign currency by 
crediting the customer\'s kyat account at a local bank.  With 
private banks shutting down and limiting withdrawals, 
however, few customers want to see their accounts credited 
with any amount of kyat.  Moreover, the relative confidence 
people seem to have in government-owned banks does not 
reflect the quality of their operations.  Rather, the public 
appears simply to believe that the government is far more 
likely to stand behind its own banks than the private banks. 
 
4. (C) Finally, observers are increasingly sensitive to the 
potential political consequences of this crisis.  One of the 
best economic correspondents in country believes that 
mismanagement of this crisis could signal the beginning of 
the end for this government, or at least its current economic 
policy.  On February 18, he received \"a panicky call\" from 
the Office of the Chief of Military Intelligence asking him 
to do an options paper for GOB review.  He has recommended, 
he said, government guarantees of deposits scaled to the size 
of deposits (e.g., 100 percent for small depositors and 
running down to zero for those over a certain limit).  He has 
also recommended triage for the troubled banks, though 
whether the government has the capacity to pick the good 
banks from the bad remains to be tested. 
 
5. (C) In short, the public is now waiting on the GOB, which 
needs to make clear how it intends to deal with this crisis. 
If it does nothing, or waits too long to sort out the mess, 
it could find itself faced with increasing political as well 
as economic problems.

Classified By: CDA a.i. Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The GOB has agreed to extend loans beginning 
next week to the country\'s beleaguered private banking 
sector.  However, the regime blames the banks for their 
predicament, and has apparently decided to let the crisis run 
its course without trying any extraordinary new steps to 
reassure depositors.  Hectic efforts by bankers to lure back 
customers, combined with some short term measures allowing 
banks access to their reserves at the Central Bank, are 
keeping the peace for now.  Next week will be a test for this 
approach, however, as almost all companies in the country 
have to meet payroll obligations on February 28.  If 
employees are not paid that day, there could be trouble.  End 
summary. 
 
Turning the Corner? 
 
2. (C) There was some optimism on February 20 that the 
banking crisis here had \"turned the corner.\"  This sentiment, 
apparently stemming from an analysis sent to Senior General 
Than Shwe, is based on an agreement between the government 
and stricken private banks for the Central Bank to advance an 
undisclosed amount of money to the banks within a week.  This 
new money, hot of the presses, will be collateralized by the 
real assets now being used as collateral for the banks\' 
outstanding loans.  Reportedly the Finance Ministry has also 
demanded that each of the private banks\' chairmen put up 
their own residence as part of the collateral. 
 
3. (C) In the meantime, the GOB has allowed banks to draw 
from their reserves on deposit at the Central Bank.  Thus far 
AWB has drawn \"several billion\" kyat by converting many of 
the GOB bonds it held in the Central Bank.  Yoma Bank has 
taken about 5 billion kyat (roughly $5 million at current 
rates).  Other banks have drawn or will reportedly draw an 
estimated 1 to 2 billion kyat per institution.  These draw 
downs will not come close to matching the outflow thus far, 
however, which is estimated at more than 200 billion kyat 
($200 million; with AWB and Yoma Banks losing 120 billion and 
60 billion kyat respectively).  That total is equivalent to 
about 40 percent of the banks\' total deposits (now reported 
as about 550 billion kyat) and virtually all of their cash on 
hand at the start of the crisis. 
 
4. (C) The hardest hit banks now are still relying on 
emergency measures to keep themselves afloat until the 
Central Bank advances are organized and paid out.  According 
to the Yoma Bank chairman, these measures include stopping 
all new lending, including credit card operators; calling in 
whatever loans it can; offering \"guaranteed\" accounts; and an 
advertising campaign urging customers to return deposits of 
any amount.  In addition, the banks are continuing to ration 
out weekly withdrawals.  Currently Yoma Bank and others are 
handing out chits to customers supposedly entitling them to a 
withdrawal (currently 100,000 kyat) several days in the 
future. 
 
GOB: \"Let Them Stew in Their Own Wine\" 
 
5. (C) For now we do not expect the GOB to take any more 
aggressive or strategic action to aid the banks in returning 
confidence -- and deposits.  Economic journalists and bankers 
with whom we spoke have all agreed that the top 
decisionmakers here (read: Vice Senior General Maung Aye and 
Senior General Than Shwe) still view the banks\' problems as 
their just reward for flouting the law with shady deals. 
\"Let them stew in their own wine,\" is one reported comment by 
Maung Aye.  The SPDC leadership has long been reported to 
dislike the private banking sector (or at least some members 
of it) because it is \"politically uncontrollable.\" 
Unfortunately, the consequences of the regime\'s actions, if 
they prove inadequate, will be felt by all twenty private 
banks, even though the junta\'s ire (and current crisis) was 
apparently provoked by the actions of only a few bankers. 
 
All Quiet...For Now 
 
6. (C) The combination of measures the banks have put in 
place seems to be working for now.  Crowds have dispersed 
from in front of bank branches, and there have been no 
further reports of stone throwing or other civil disorder. 
Presumably individual depositors will remain calm as long as 
there is some credible promise of payment and some hope to 
recover their funds.  If the banks get the transfusion they 
need from the Central Bank, matters may sort themselves out. 
Some business people, in fact, are confident that the lines 
of credit will restore enough liquidity to get commerce, 
largely frozen since February 18, moving again. 
 
7. (C) Because those with kyat are holding tight in case of 
further emergency, asset prices have been dropping rapidly. 
The price of gold has dropped 35 percent since February 14 
and the dollar has fallen to 950 kyat/dollar (after dipping 
to 800 kyat/dollar briefly on February 19).  This trend 
should reverse in the short term if confidence is restored. 
However, we may not see a return to the same rates of general 
inflation and kyat depreciation that prevailed before the 
crisis.  One healthy result of the this crisis has been to 
purge the economy of the uncontrolled credit creation system 
run by the informal financial system.  With hindsight, it now 
appears that their operations might have accounted for as 
much as half of the credit creation and half the inflation 
that plagued Burma over the past three years.  Provided the 
Central Bank retires its advances to the banking system as 
customers return their deposits, not at all a sure thing, 
overall inflation in Burma could settle to levels much lower 
than we have witnessed over the past several years. 
 
How Long Can the Peace Hold? 
 
8. (C) The coming week will test the current government 
strategy.  In particular there are two dates looming that 
might exacerbate the situation.  First, Senior General Than 
Shwe is scheduled to leave for Malaysia this weekend.  As he 
is the sole arbiter of policy, should a downturn occur early 
next week the GOB will likely be paralyzed.  Second, pay day 
across the country for many wage earners is February 28.  If 
a significant number of employers are unable to meet payroll, 
there could be some serious consequences.

SUBJECT: AUNG SAN SUU KYI AVOIDS JAIL, CALLS REGIME\'S 
BLUFF 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Aung San Suu Kyi was found guilty of 
wrongful restraint February 21 in a civil suit brought by 
her cousin.  The NLD Chairman says the court\'s judgment was 
\"definitely politically motivated,\" and her lawyer outlined 
several procedural irregularities.  Daw Suu reportedly 
objected to the judgment and the process and was prepared to 
go to jail for a week rather than admit guilt and pay a 
nominal fine.  As two thousand people crowded around the 
courthouse, the government backed off, issuing a \"suspension 
of judgment\" decree, handing Aung San Suu Kyi another 
principled victory, for the time being at least.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The Incident 
 
On May 8, 2002, two days after Aung San Suu Kyi was released 
from house arrest, her maternal cousin, Soe Aung, appeared 
on her housing compound and accosted her in front of the NLD 
leadership.  He punched her and was banished from the 
compound.  She sued him for \"outraging the modesty of a 
woman\" and he counter-sued her for wrongful restraint.  The 
cousin had once lived in a small building on the family 
compound, and apparently wanted to move back in. 
 
3. (SBU) \"Politically Motivated\" 
 
At a February 21 press conference at NLD HQ, Aung San Suu 
Kyi\'s lawyer and the assembled party leadership detailed the 
events of the day.  Both ASSK and her cousin were found 
guilty and received small fines or short jail terms.  ASSK 
objected to the process and judgment, refusing to pay the 
small fine and claiming she would go to jail for the seven 
days if necessary.  Her lawyer detailed some legal 
irregularities.  When a U.S. reporter asked if the NLD 
leadership thought the case was politically motivated, the 
NLD Chairman answered, \"It definitely was politically 
motivated.\" 
 
4. (SBU) How\'s That? 
 
Soe Aung is said to have been put up to this by the regime. 
Local political analysts tell us a number of ASSK\'s family 
members have been approached by the SPDC and encouraged to 
bring lawsuits against her.  Entangling her in tawdry civil 
litigation with family members would diminish her status of 
international icon.  We know of at least one other suit 
filed against her by a family member. One also wonders how 
Soe Aung could have gotten access to her compound, isolated 
as it is by tight police checkpoints. 
 
5. (SBU) So What? 
 
What was perhaps a regime-supported smear effort has 
backfired, as ASSK once again stood by her principles and 
called the government\'s bluff.  Given the tension in the 
city arising from the ongoing banking crisis, the 
authorities perhaps sensed that this event could have 
sparked trouble.  The regime has backed down for now, but we 
note the judgment was only suspended, not overturned.

1. (C) Summary: The GOB has finally made a public statement 
(on February 21) and committed to a strategy that will 
hopefully spark a turnaround and begin to reshape the private 
banking sector.  As the crisis enters its second week, we can 
only await the effect of the GOB\'s strategy on depositors, 
industry, and wage earners.  End summary. 
 
S-1: Go About Your Business 
 
2. (C) Secretary One (S-1), General Khin Nyunt, made the 
first public GOB statement on the banking crisis on Friday 
the 21st.  To ensure its readers would not skip over the 
important message, which was buried toward the end of a 
ponderous speech on the economy, the SPDC mouthpiece \"The New 
Light of Myanmar\" printed in bold type (in both the English 
and Burmese language editions) S-1\'s brief statement on the 
banks. 
 
3. (C) The comment, surprisingly measured, called on people 
to \"do their work as usual without any worry concerning the 
banks.\"  The causes for the current crisis were not 
\"destructionist elements,\" but negative \"rumors\" about the 
safety of the banks.  S-1 assured listeners that money is 
safer in the banks than outside, and that \"banks guarantee 
the safety of the savings.\"  While not going so far as to 
extend a GOB guarantee of people\'s savings, S-1 did say that 
\"the government is rendering assistance for the convenience 
of the people.\" 
 
Assistance Being Rendered 
 
4. (C) In fact, the GOB did start off the week with some 
efforts to get the crisis under control.  Bankers and other 
businessmen corroborated a rumor we\'d been hearing that the 
Central Bank had extended lines of credit worth 25 billion 
kyat (about $25 million) to the three largest private banks 
-- AWB, Yoma, and KBZ -- and between 10 billion and 20 
billion kyat total to three other private banks -- MOB, MUB, 
and Mayflower.  As mentioned in Ref A, this money is being 
offered only to banks that can provide collateral (real 
assets) both on their books and in their possession.  At the 
end of business on February 24, limits on withdrawals were 
still in place and most private banks still were offering 
only 100,000 kyat (about $100) per week to depositors. 
 
5. (C) We\'ve also heard that the quasi-governmental 
association overseeing Burma\'s industrial zones has 
instructed garment factory owners to discuss with their 
bankers the lifting, if need be, of withdrawal ceilings to 
allow for factories to meet payroll requirements on February 
28.  The details and background of this order are unclear, 
but the businessmen posited that the regime had ordered 
private banks to support factory payroll operations as part 
of the deal for additional loans from the Central Bank. 
 
6. (C) Trading companies and other firms needing to meet 
payroll have not received similar instructions.  However, one 
large trader with whom we spoke said that he expected banks 
to offer some sort of preferential system of withdrawals for 
corporate customers as payday draws near. 
 
Comment 
 
7. (C) The GOB appears to be stumbling toward a reasonable, 
market-based solution to the current banking crisis.  It 
hasn\'t provided an across-the-board guarantee of deposits, 
and has required the banks to cough up real collateral in 
return for the additional liquidity they require.  The 
collateral will help ensure banks retire their borrowings 
from the Central Bank as soon as they can, while the lack of 
a deposit guarantee will leave the onus on depositors, if and 
when they do get access to their accounts, to choose the best 
bank for any return deposits they make.  Some banks -- 
basically the worst of them -- will go under, but that\'s the 
price of bad operations.  Only if all banks threaten to sink 
will the GOB have to do more. End comment.

Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The simultaneous crash of the formal and 
informal banking sectors in Burma starting February 14 led 
many to expect the worst.  Although day laborers and small 
depositors have been hit the hardest, thus far calm has 
dominated.  People are frustrated, but not angry enough to 
take political action.  The reasons for this tranquillity are 
manifold, but primarily revolve around the relatively small 
role played by the financial sector here as well as the 
seemingly endless patience of the Burmese people.  End 
summary. 
 
Trust in Private Banks is Weak 
 
2. (C) With all the concern about the recent private banking 
crisis, it is important to remember that out of an IMF 
estimated 1.3 trillion kyat (M2) sloshing through the white, 
brown, and black markets of Burma, the twenty private banks 
estimated that they held only 550 billion kyat when the 
recent crisis hit on February 14.  The rest was on deposit 
with the informal banking sector, out in circulation as cash 
in the hands of the public, or in the state-owned banks.  The 
result is that the formal banking system in Burma does not 
have deep roots.  Private banking has been available for less 
than ten years, and many average Burmese have been slow to 
understand and trust the system.  In addition, the GOB\'s 
artificial ceiling on deposit rates (10 percent per year) has 
been a major disincentive to depositors facing inflation 
rates of 60 percent and higher.  Finally, the steady 
depreciation of the kyat over the past several years (down 
315 percent against the dollar since January 2000) has 
dissuaded private and corporate customers from keeping many 
kyat assets.  One estimate we heard was that 90 percent of 
the business community keeps little or no kyat (either in the 
bank or on hand), preferring to change all kyat immediately 
into gold or dollars, which can be cashed in as need be. 
 
3. (C) Those lining up outside banks over the past week are 
primarily traders, who keep money in the banks for a short 
time to facilitate transactions or secure access to credit; 
some private companies who use banks for handling accounts 
receivable and payroll; and a few smaller depositors who were 
too honest to invest their kyat in real assets or the 
informal banking sector, and too nervous of demonetization to 
keep money under their pillows.  Very few of the elite rely 
significantly on the banking system, instead keeping their 
money in real estate, autos, dollars, gold, or other rapidly 
appreciating assets. 
 
Pay Packet Comes With Apologies 
 
4. (C) The average Burmese is harder hit by the decline of 
the formal banking sector as a wage earner than as a 
depositor.  Large construction firms, who feast on cheap 
credit (lending rates are held to only 15 percent per year) 
to build high-rise apartments and office towers, have had to 
stop their projects and thus payment of their day laborers. 
Likewise, many factories and other firms that had been using 
the private banks have been unable to pay their day laborers 
since last Monday the 17th, and are fearing the end of the 
month\'s larger payroll obligations. 
 
The Meek Shall Inherit One Percent a Month, Maybe 
 
5. (C) Though wage earners may suffer if the private banks 
are not liquid by week\'s end, many are already under pressure 
due to the nearly simultaneous crash of the 250 billion kyat 
informal financial sector.  An estimated 100,000-200,000 
depositors, many pensioners or other naive investors who were 
taking advantage of the \"too good to be true\" rates available 
at these shadow banks (described in Ref E), lost their shirts 
when these nineteen institutions crashed.  There were rumors 
that many of the elite, and several of the private banks, 
were also involved with these informal banks.  However, the 
numbers are not likely high enough for this shady sector\'s 
demise to unhinge society here. 
6. (C) The future is uncertain for the legions of depositors 
caught up in the informal banking crash.  Apparently the GOB 
has seized the assets of the shadow banks and has formed a 
\"Liquidation Committee\" to sell off the properties and 
ostensibly use the proceeds to repay depositors.  However, 
there has been no public announcement of the Committee\'s 
exact intentions or any timeline.  One or two of the larger 
informal banks have also announced that they would continue 
to add interest (at one percent a month) to their depositors 
accounts, for a lump payout sometime in late 2003 or early 
2004.  None of the bankers or businessmen with whom we spoke 
believes this tale, however. 
1987 Revisited? 
 
7. (C) The jury is still out on who will be hit hardest by 
the latest economic fiasco.  Many businessmen now are 
effectively whistling past the graveyard, but, with the GOB 
talking about liquidation proceedings for the real assets 
accumulated by the informal financial institutions, the 
prospects for any further speculative gains on real property 
has to be limited.  The private banking crisis might also 
feed some agitation if workers miss their monthly pay, and 
day laborers go into their second week without wages. 
However, widespread unrest still seems unlikely for three 
reasons. 
 
8. (C) First, people are more diversified than they were 
during the demonetization of 1987 but, more importantly, the 
demonetization of 1987 destroyed the value of the most 
commonly held financial asset in Burma -- the kyat.  In 
contrast, this 2003 crisis has actively boosted demand for 
and the value of kyat, as individuals have built up 
precautionary and transactions balances in their homes.  The 
government\'s rescue plan hinges on extending collateralized 
loans to the troubled private banks.  If banks repay these 
loans, and the government retires the money when it\'s 
returned, the long term impact of the crisis may ease 
inflation and stabilize the kyat primarily through the 
destruction of the uncontrolled credit creation system run by 
the informal banking institutions.  These played a larger 
role than initially suspected in the country\'s recent lurches 
toward hyper-inflation and the sharp depreciation of the 
kyat.  In short, people may have difficulty gathering access 
to their deposits now, but there is hope that the kyat they 
do get will have more lasting value, or at least will 
depreciate more slowly than in recent years. 
 
9. (C) Secondly, who can complain about losing money in 
blatantly illegal Ponzi schemes (which is effectively what 
the informal financial institutions were)?  The GOB could 
have acted sooner, and more methodically, to curb the 
speculation through these companies, but investors knew they 
were taking awful risks in hopes of awesome gains. 
 
10. (C) Finally, the Burmese people are patient.  Despite one 
or two rock-throwing incidents, as the crisis unfolded on 
February 17 and 18 most customers dispersed peacefully with 
nothing but assurances from their bankers that at least some 
money would be available if they came back \"next week.\"  For 
the average Burmese bank customer, so far, that has been 
enough.

2.  (SBU)  Begin report text: 
 
Embassy Rangoon Human Rights Strategy for Burma 
 
The United States has staked out a position in Burma as a 
resolute advocate of human rights and rapid political change. 
 We have also worked with like-minded countries to maintain 
maximum international pressure on Burma, pending reform. 
That pressure includes continued trade, investment, and 
travel sanctions; the denial of any form of aid support, with 
the single exception of humanitarian assistance; continued 
public criticism of Burma; support for democratic movements 
opposed to the current dictatorship; and public diplomacy 
programs focused on democratic values, human rights, and good 
governance.  It also includes support for international 
efforts to foster change in Burma, through the missions of UN 
Special Envoy Razali and UN Special Rapporteur on Human 
Rights Pinheiro, as well as the efforts of the ILO, the ICRC, 
and other international organizations. 
 
Sanctions: In coordination with the European Union and other 
states, the United States has imposed comprehensive sanctions 
on Burma.  They include an arms embargo; a ban on all new 
U.S. investment in Burma; the suspension of all bilateral 
aid, including counternarcotics assistance; the withdrawal of 
GSP privileges, the denial of OPIC and EXIMBANK programs; 
visa restrictions on Burma\'s senior government officials; and 
a hold on all new lending or grant programs by the World 
bank, the IMF, the ADB, and other international financial 
institutions.  We have also maintained our representation in 
Burma at the Charge d\'Affaires level since 1990. 
 
Public Criticism: The United States has co-sponsored annual 
resolutions at the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission 
on Human Rights that highlight and draw international 
attention to the continued human rights violations in Burma. 
We also support the ILO\'s unprecedented decision which calls 
on all ILO members to review their relations with Burma in 
view of its \"widespread and systematic\" use of forced labor, 
as well as the ILO\'s efforts since then to bring the Burmese 
government in compliance with its obligations.  Annual U.S. 
reports on human rights and religious freedom in Burma have 
also painted a grim picture of continuing violations here. 
 
Public Scrutiny: The United States has encouraged increased 
public scrutiny of the human rights situation in Burma.  We 
have supported the missions of UN Special Envoy Razali, who 
has traveled to Burma eight times since 2000, and the mission 
of UN Special Rapporteur Pinheiro, who has visited Burma four 
times.  Their combined efforts have resulted in the release 
of over 500 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, 
additional freedoms for the political opposition 
(particularly in regard to ability to travel), and the 
re-opening of opposition political party offices.  We have 
also encouraged ICRC\'s efforts to improve the conditions of 
Burma\'s prisons, facilitate the release of political 
prisoners, and protect vulnerable ethnic populations.  ICRC 
now has over 40 expatriate staff in Burma and access to many 
previously restricted areas along the Thai border.  In 
addition, we have urged all UN agencies to join UNHCR (now 
active among the Rohingya Muslim minority in northern Rakhine 
State) in providing protection services and advocacy on human 
rights issues in areas where they are active.  Finally, we 
have pushed the Burmese government to accept visits by 
reputed international human rights organizations, such as 
Amnesty International, which completed its first visit to 
Burma in February 2003. 
 
Support for the Democratic Opposition:  The United States 
annually provides $6.5 million in support for the Burmese 
democratic opposition.  These funds are programmed through 
the National Endowment for Democracy, among others, and are 
used for the collection and dissemination of information on 
democracy and human rights, and the support of democratic 
groups, including women\'s, labor, and ethnic groups, in Burma 
and along Burma\'s borders.  Specific activities include 
support for newspapers, radio broadcasts, and investigations 
of human rights violations, as reported by refugees and 
exiles. 
 
Advocacy: The U.S. Mission in Burma has been a persistent and 
effective advocate for human rights.  We maintain frequent 
contacts with the political opposition, including the 
National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi, and 
regularly consult with a range of opposition leaders 
regarding initiatives that will affect the struggle for 
democracy in Burma.  We maintain similar contacts with 
representatives of Burma\'s ethnic minorities who have been 
struggling for a voice in Burma\'s government for more than 
half a century.  We have also pressed the government in 
strong and public terms to honestly and effectively 
investigate allegations of human rights abuses.  In 2002, 
when the Burmese government categorically denied that its 
soldiers had been involved in any of the rapes detailed in a 
report entitled \"License to Rape,\" the Mission\'s Charge\' 
called the government to account at a public press conference 
and continued to press for an investigation of the charges by 
an independent international team.  Those efforts resulted in 
continued international attention to the case, continued 
government investigations of the charges, and a government 
invitation to UN Special Rapporteur Pinheiro to investigate 
the case.  The U.S. Mission in Burma has also spoken out 
firmly in support of the political rights of the democratic 
opposition.  When Aung San Suu Kyi was harassed by 
government-affiliated organizations during a tour of Rakhine 
State, the U.S. Mission coordinated statements with Great 
Britain, among others, which called the government to account. 
 
Public Diplomacy: We continue to focus public diplomacy 
programs on democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and 
good governance.  In FY 2002, the Embassy\'s Public Affairs 
section spent $205,000 on speaker programs, exchange 
programs, and publications and other information outreach. 
In FY 2003, we expanded our international visitors program by 
$105,000 to include six additional grantees from civil 
society organizations active in their communities.  In 
addition, the Public Affairs section\'s direct teaching 
program offered tuition waivers worth $8,000 to 33 students 
denied the opportunity to study elsewhere because of their 
political beliefs.  These programs target individuals from 
humanitarian aid NGO\'s, the political opposition, religious 
and ethnic groups, the press, and academia, with the aim of 
assisting civil society organizations in developing their own 
effective advocacy on democracy and human rights issues in 
Burma.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Mounting public frustration with the 
country\'s disgraced, largely Chinese-owned, private banks has 
led to fears among the Chinese business community and others 
of an anti-Chinese backlash.  Though this remains a 
possibility, particularly if SPDC decides it needs a 
convenient scapegoat, the vast majority of depositers appear 
thus far more inclined to blame the SPDC, rather than the 
Chinese, for their troubles.  End summary. 
 
Chinese Dominance in Banking Sector 
 
2. (C) There is no denying the Chinese dominance in the 
banking sector.  Of the nation\'s twenty private banks, only 
eight are actually owned and operated by private citizens (as 
opposed to various government ministries or the military\'s 
economic arms).  Of these eight privately held private banks, 
six of them have chairmen or primary owners of Chinese 
descent.  Of the odd banks out, one is run by a Shan crony of 
Senior General Than Shwe, the other by a Burman. 
 
3. (C) The Chinese were less prominent in the recently 
imploded informal financial institutions as, in those, 
Burmans and Muslims also played a large role.  Of the 16-17 
shadow banks whose ownership we have been able to trace, only 
four were Chinese or ethnic Chinese Burmese.  Four were 
Indian or Muslim, and the rest Burman. 
 
Finger Pointing 
 
4. (C) There is some concern (particularly in the Chinese 
business community) that the dominance of ethnic Chinese in 
the disgraced banking sector will trigger public resentment 
against the Chinese population.  There is some history of 
this, with anti-Chinese riots occuring in the 1960s.  Indeed, 
it is not outside the SPDC\'s bag of tricks to try and divert 
political discontent caused by its bungling of the banking 
crisis, by surreptitiously feeding the notion that the 
\"conniving\" Chinese are to blame. 
 
5. (C) However, barring some obvious act of provocation, we 
don\'t think this is likely.  Commentators here tell us that 
while people may have lost faith in the banks, most don\'t 
connect their downfall with the ethnicity of their ownership. 
 However, the problem may be that people here, consciously or 
unconciously, factor enthnicity into their calculations about 
the probability of a GOB rescue.  In any case, the banks 
hardest hit by withdrawals (AWB, Yoma, MUB, MOB, and 
Mayflower) have by and large been owned or managed by ethnic 
Chinese banks.  Finally, the possibility of ethnic strife 
remains in the back of many minds.  As one economic 
journalist warned us, because of residual anti-Chinese 
sentiment among Burmans, it would not be too difficult to 
stir up ethnic-derived conflict. 
 
6. (C) That all said, our feeling so far is that the public\'s 
ire will fall squarely on the ruling junta.  After enduring 
fifteen years of economic mismanagement and political 
oppression by the SLORC/SPDC regime, the public (at least in 
Rangoon) is primed to blame its daily woes on the junta.  In 
the meantime, the ethnic Chinese chairmen and management of 
the private banks are bending over backward to regain their 
customers trust -- through notices, advertising, and efforts 
to explain the situation and fairly disburse available funds. 
 Provided these bankers are not caught up in some new 
scandal, they should be able to avoid any undue blame for the 
current crisis.

SUBJECT: MUSLIM REPRESSION AND RESENTMENT NEAR BURMA\'S 
BORDER WITH BANGLADESH 
 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ. REASON: 1.5 (D) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  The Burmese regime\'s repression of the 
mostly Muslim population of northern Rakhine State, located 
along the border with Bangladesh, is breeding resentment and 
poverty.  DCM visited the area in mid-February as part of a 
trip to the region organized by UNHCR for diplomats.  UNHCR\'s 
protective services are limiting the oppression and its 
coordination of NGO and other UN agency projects is providing 
the only development effort in the region.  The security 
forces in northern Rakhine State, reportedly numbering 8,000, 
are an extractive presence, largely self-financing and/or 
self-enriching.  Incidents of forced labor have fallen due to 
the completion of a UN-supported gravel road that has reduced 
the security forces\' need for forced porterage to isolated 
outposts.  End Summary 
 
2. (SBU) POOR, CROWDED, AND ISOLATED:  The three townships 
(akin to counties in the U.S.) nearest the Bangladesh border 
in Rakhine State have a population of 800,000, the vast 
majority of whom are Bengali-speaking Muslims.  About a 
quarter of a million people in this area have returned to 
Burma after fleeing as refugees to Bangladesh in the 1990s. 
By almost any socio-economic measure this is Burma\'s poorest 
and most crowded rural region--the UN reports 61% of children 
are malnourished and 35% are severely stunted.  The area 
consists of mountainous peninsulas flanked by tidal estuaries 
that are too brackish for irrigation.  The 18 feet of rain 
per year falls in 5 months, meaning there are two seasons: 
dust and mud.  There is no motorable road connection with 
Bangladesh--the only official entry point from Bangladesh is 
the estuary port of Maungdaw. 
 
3.  (C) NO RECENT INSURGENT ACTIVITY:  According to 
residents, NGO and UN expatriates, and UN and NGO local staff 
members intimately familiar with the region, there has been 
no serious insurgent activity in northern Rakhine State for 
several years (notwithstanding insurgent press releases). 
One source claimed the last major incident was in 1994.  A 
French NGO worker related an incident from 2001 in which four 
members of the security forces were murdered at night in 
their camp.  He believed it had something to do with forced 
prostitution or trafficking in women and was probably not 
insurgent related.  After the murders, her continued, the 
security forces rounded up the inhabitants of a nearby 
village and penned them in a field for two days with no food 
or water.  Two toddlers, who were left at the village, 
reportedly died.  Other sources said that occasional slit 
throats or stabbings are sometimes vaguely attributed to \"the 
RSO\" (the Rohingya Solidarity Organization, commonly used to 
refer to any Muslim insurgents), but are likely the result of 
local resentments and outraged husbands or fathers.  \"RSO\" 
members (i.e., militant Muslim refugees) total about 200 
individuals, according to one informed local estimate. 
 
3.  (C) RAPACIOUS SECURITY FORCES:  UN sources report that 
there are some 8,000 security force personnel occupying about 
80 sites in the three townships.  Most are members of the 
hybrid Burmese border patrol known as NaSaKa (the Burmese 
acronym for Border Immigration HQ).  Nearly every bridge, 
tunnel, intersection, hamlet, and government building is 
\"guarded\" by a detachment of armed men.  We met with the 
notorious NaSaKa commander Aung Ngwe who is such an egregious 
abuser of human rights, even by Burmese military standards, 
that he was previously ordered back to Rangoon for a sharp 
reprimand.  However, he is back commanding the border region, 
with his actions unchanged, according to locals. 
 
4  (C) SECURITY FORCES SELF-FINANCING, SELF-ENRICHING:  UN 
and NGO staffers say the security forces extract revenue and 
labor from the local population at every opportunity, in 
part, they contend, because the SPDC has made the conscious 
decision to make security operations there self-financing. 
This approach has the added \"benefit\" of dampening the pull 
factor from even more-crowded nearby areas of Bangladesh, 
they add.  For example, Aung Ngwe has licensed nearly every 
conceivable economic activity to a crony, friend, or partner. 
 Poor woodcutters must sell their daily cuttings to the 
monopoly licensee for 8 kyat a bundle; Aung Ngwe\'s buddy 
turns around and sells it for 20 kyat.  We drove through a 
large GOB cashew plantation.  Aung Ngwe personally pockets 
the proceeds from the cashew nuts, we were told, but allows 
the villagers who pick the crop to keep some of the cashew 
fruit.  Every checkpoint extracts a 50 kyat fee or a pack of 
cigarettes from the cargo bicycles that move rice and 
provisions through the township.  Aung Ngwe even sold the 
right to charge tolls on a bridge connecting the port of 
Maungdaw to the center of town--the tollbooth has since been 
removed after UN complaints.  Muslims routinely must bribe 
officials to travel within or between the three townships. 
 
5.  (C)  HUMAN RIGHTS:  The UNHCR documents reports of 
incidents of forced labor and forced contributions in the 
area.  The number of incidents has fallen in 2002, the UNHCR 
explains, not because of a change in GOB policy or action, 
but because of the completion of a road financed by a WFP 
food-for-work project and the Japanese NGO BAJ.  This road 
allows NaSaKa easier motorized access to hitherto isolated 
outposts close to the Bangladesh border and has reduced the 
need for porterage services of the locals. 
 
--  At one village the Australian DCM was slipped a note by a 
person requesting protection/support from GOB oppression.  A 
UNHCR staffer said, \"Bad news.  MI minders saw the note being 
passed, so now we\'ll have to visit this village two or three 
times a week for the next couple of months to make sure that 
everybody here is ok.\" 
 
-- DCM spoke with one landless Muslim man who, amid tears, 
explained that his daughter was in jail and he had no money 
to pay for transport to the township capital, bribe the 
soldiers at the numerous checkpoints along the way, or to 
bribe the judge.  His daughter had accused the GOB-appointed 
village headman of sexual assault, as had another young woman 
in the village.  When NaSaka commander Aung Ngwe heard of the 
accusation against the village headman (his friend), he 
ordered the two women arrested.  The village headman is also 
in jail, but has access to resources to sway the outcome of 
proceedings, our contacts explained. 
 
6.  (C) RETURNEES AND UNHCR:  About 25 refugees per week are 
returning from Bangladesh--all by boat through the river port 
of Maungdaw.  UNHCR estimates approximately 5,000 will be 
willing and able to return by time of the closure of the 
UNHCR repatriation program at the end of June.  This means 
that weekly returnee rates will need to increase at least 
ten-fold to meet this deadline.  Once out of the repatriation 
business, UNHCR staffers admitted that they will be 
hard-pressed to justify the continuation of their programs in 
the border area, which in reality are a mix of UNDP-type 
development activities and normal ICRC protective services. 
 
7. (SBU) WHAT\'S IN A NAME?:  When returning refugees are 
processed at Maungdaw UNHCR helps them fill out the 
immigration and customs forms.  Returnees are asked to 
declare their ethnicity, nationality, and religion.  The 
standard and approved method by which UNHCR helps fill out 
the cards yields the following:  Ethnicity - Bengali; 
Nationality - Myanmar; Religion - Muslim.  While the 
returnees are not considered citizens of Myanmar, they are 
apparently considered nationals. 
 
--  DCM did not once hear the word \"Rohingya\" used by anyone 
to describe Muslim Bengali-speakers.  Rather, \"Muslim\" is 
used.  One Muslim local staffer explained he had once written 
Rohingya on a form, but was told by the local authorities not 
to use it. 
 
--  \"RSO\" is commonly used to describe any Muslim insurgents, 
frequently accompanied by a vague wave in the direction of 
the Bangladeshi border. 
 
--  Buddhist Rakhine-speakers are usually called Rakhines. 
 
--  Arakan, another term for the state, people, and language, 
was used in private conversation by pro-democracy individuals 
in the ancient Arakan capital of Mrauk-Oo and elsewhere. 
Aung San Suu Kyi and her allies in the Arakan League for 
Democracy also use \"Arakan.\" 
 
--  Almost everybody used Yangon and Myanmar vice Rangoon and 
Burma, but quite a few people used Burmese (vice Myanmar) 
when referring to the language and \"Myanmar people\" when 
referring to the Burmese nationality.  Several Arakanese 
voiced lingering resentment at the destruction of the capital 
city of Mrauk-Oo by Burmese invaders in 1754. 
 
-- Nobody used the older term \"Akyab\" for the city of Sittwe, 
the capital of Rakhine State. 
 
8.  (C) THE STATUS OF ISLAM:  The practice of Islam is not 
restricted, commander Aung Ngwe assured us.  Indeed, we saw 
many Muslims worshipping throughout the area.  One catch is 
that the authorities prohibit the construction or repair of 
mosques.  As a result, most mosques are in severe disrepair. 
In Maungdaw, the largest city in the (almost completely 
Muslim) township of 431,000 people, the central mosque has no 
roof.  On a Muslim holiday we witnessed thousands of 
worshippers crowded into what in effect was an courtyard 
enclosed by a brick wall painted green--and this in a city 
that gets 18 feet of rain per year. 
 
 
9.  (C) INDIAN PLANS IN THE AREA:  During the many hours we 
spent traveling on the broad rivers of northern Rakhine, the 
Indian ambassador detailed an approved GOI-GOB plan to 
connect NE India to the Bay of Bengal via a road-river link 
utilizing the Kaladan River.  India and Burma would dredge 
and, where needed, widen, the Kaladan River to enable cargo 
ships to ply most of the distance between Sittwe and the 
Indian border.  The northern-most link would entail about 40 
miles of blacktopped road.  A cargo terminal would be built 
at Sittwe and at the navigable northern end of the Kaladan 
River, he reported.  This route will cut by three-quarters 
the transport time for goods between NE India and Calcutta, 
he claimed.  Survey and planning has commenced, he added, 
with the project to be concluded \"in about six years.\" 
 
10.  (C) COMMENT:  The GOB policies in northern Rakhine are a 
wonderful example of how not to win friends and influence 
people.  The seething resentment is almost palpable and is, 
in fact, visible.  As we traveled by boat up the rivers and 
estuaries from central to northern Rakhine State, the UNHCR 
staff suggested that we note the reaction of people along the 
riverbanks to our presence.  Sure enough, during the first 
part of the voyage people called out, smiled, and waved as we 
sped past.  Further on, folks wouldn\'t even return a wave, 
and often stepped back into the brush as we approached.  The 
change occurred about the same place Buddhist temples stopped 
appearing in villages.  The Muslim-majority townships felt 
like an area suffering from an oppressive occupier, with 
Islam the prime uniting and potentially mobilizing force. 
End Comment.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAID, SOCI, ECON, BM, NGO 
SUBJECT: NEW HEALTH MINISTER PROGRESSIVE ON VCT 
 
1. (U) This is an action request for EAP/BCLTV.  Please see 
paragraph 7. 
 
2. (SBU) Summary:  The COM had a productive courtesy call on 
the new Health Minister, pressing him on expanded VCT, 
discussing an expected private health care law, and 
presenting the case for visits to Burma by Orbis and 
Operation Smile.  The Minister said he looked forward to 
future U.S.-Burma dialogue on VCT and humanitarian aid 
issues, and that he would try to be available when the USG 
delegation led by OES DAS Chow comes to Rangoon at the end of 
March.  End summary. 
 
Voluntary Counseling and Testing Progress Possible 
 
3. (SBU) The Chief of Mission paid a courtesy call on the new 
Health Minister, Dr. Kyaw Myint, on February 26.   From the 
outset of the meeting, it was clear the new Minister has 
taken a far more positive position on INGO participation in 
voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), than had his 
predecessor.  Responding to the COM\'s questions, the Minister 
said that the GOB would be willing to allow INGOs to provide 
VCT services for at-risk communities (including TB patients). 
 However, he agreed that, the devil was in the details.  He 
would not elaborate on what the outstanding details were, or 
how the GOB currently stood on them, but he did urge the U.S. 
government to send out someone to work out these details with 
the Ministry.  Along these lines, the Minister was curious 
why the CDC visit had been canceled, and said he looked 
forward to its return. 
 
Private Healthcare Soon to Be Legalized 
 
4. (SBU) When asked about the status of a long-awaited law 
legalizing private health care, the Minister turned to his 
deputies to respond.  They were evasive, saying only that the 
draft was in with the Attorney General\'s office, and that 
when it emerged it should be ready for promulgation.  The law 
will allow provision of health care by properly licensed and 
supervised private clinics and pharmacies (currently private 
clinics operate without official sanction).  The Minister\'s 
staff was vague on the matter of foreign participation in the 
new private health care sector.  However, the message seemed 
clear that foreigners would not be allowed to participate 
unless they were physicians licensed by the Myanmar Medical 
Association. 
 
Orbis, Operation Smile Welcome 
 
5. (U) The COM queried the Minister on the possibility of 
U.S.-based non-profits Orbis and Operation Smile coming to 
Burma.  The Minister replied that Orbis was \"an old friend\" 
and could come anytime (Note: Orbis was in Burma most 
recently in 2000).   He mentioned that there was already 
significant international assistance for cleft palate and 
facial reconstructive surgery, and that local doctors were 
also performing these operations for the poorest children. 
However, he said that Operation Smile should come to discuss 
with the MOH a possible visit to Burma.  The COM gave the 
Minister some background information on Operation Smile and 
Orbis and told him we would advise these organizations of his 
response. 
 
Looking for Help 
 
6. (SBU) The Minister volunteered the fact that Burma and the 
GOB desperately need additional international assistance and 
funding to effectively tackle the country\'s health-related 
priorities.  He said the small amount of such funding and 
advice to date have been major obstacles to success.  The 
Minister urged the United States to become more engaged, by 
exchanging proposals for areas of possible cooperation.  The 
COM responded that we expected a visit at the end of March of 
a USG delegation, led by OES DAS Chow, looking to discuss 
matters of health and humanitarian assistance.  The Minister 
responded that he would try to find time on his schedule to 
meet with the delegation. 
 
Action Request 
 
7. (SBU) For EAP/BCLTV:  Please contact Operation Smile and 
Orbis to relay the Minister\'s message.  Operation Smile, if 
interested in coming to Burma, should consider sending a 
representative to lay the groundwork with key MOH officials.

Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Week two of the banking crisis started with 
grand hopes of a resolution to liquidity problems, but closed 
with little change in the overall situation.  The GOB started 
the week strong, with the apparent extension of Central Bank 
loans on the 24th, but remained disturbingly silent and 
inactive the rest of the week.  Banks continue to hemorrhage 
deposits, and are maintaining, and in some cases reducing, 
their withdrawal limits.  Despite a stalled economy, and 
without significant assistance from the banks, companies 
scrimped and saved to ensure payday passed on the 28th with 
no apparent disruption.  However, it appears employers may 
have used up their last reserves to meet payroll, and may 
have little left to face any future shocks.  End summary. 
 
Banks Still in Doldrums 
 
2. (C) Rumors at the beginning of the week that Burma\'s 
private banks would lift their weekly withdrawal limits by 
February 26 proved to be greatly exaggerated.  It is clear 
that some private banks are having more trouble than others, 
but all are in increasingly desperate straits.  All private 
banks maintained withdrawal ceilings throughout the week. 
However, until February 27, some were still able to provide 
500,000 kyat (about $500) per week to customers.  By fiat of 
the Myanmar Banking Association, as of February 27 all banks 
were told to reduce their weekly limits to no more than 
100,000 kyat (though some banks were reportedly only able to 
provide 50,000 kyat per customer/week).  Bankers report 
dismal conditions at branches across Burma, though the 
tightest situations remain in Rangoon and Mandalay. 
 
3. (C) According to our calculations, over the course of this 
week the combination of tokens and withdrawal limits applied 
by the banks allowed for withdrawals of at most 30 billion 
kyat.  In fact, banking sources say that net outflows were 
likely quite close to the full 30 billion -- a bad sign for 
the banks.  AWB, KBZ, and the other large banks have been 
willing in a very few cases to lift their withdrawal limits 
slightly for major depositors who needed emergency cash to 
meet their payrolls.  However, the amounts that the banks 
actually allowed to be withdrawn were reportedly far lower 
than their customers demanded.  Two bankers reported that 
military intelligence insisted on vetting all requests for 
emergency withdrawals, approving very few. 
 
4. (C) On the plus side, bankers reported some return of 
deposits (mostly into so-called \"guaranteed\" accounts). 
However, the number of returnees was relatively 
insignificant.  Likewise, businesspeople report that the 
banks asked borrowers to repay immediately between 25-40 
percent of their outstanding balances.  However, business and 
banking sources have told us that borrowers have no ability 
to repay since commerce has slowed to a halt and companies 
are conserving every kyat on hand to pay employees and other 
current expenses.  We\'ve heard rumors as well that banks have 
sold or are trying to sell some of their real assets in an 
effort to bolster cash reserves. 
 
5. (C) All in all, the total estimated withdrawals this week 
make the total outflow over the last two weeks roughly 230 
billion kyat (about 200 percent of estimated cash on hand in 
all private banks at the beginning of the crisis).  In 
response, the GOB this week reportedly extended 33 billion 
kyat in loans to the three most troubled banks (AWB, Yoma, 
KBZ).  The Central Bank also allegedly loaned 20 billion kyat 
to three second-tier banks (MUB, MOB, and Mayflower). 
However, comments from some bankers (including Yoma Bank\'s 
General Manager) have raised some questions as to whether all 
of these Central Bank advances ever were actually made. 
 
Wages Will Be Paid, But No Thanks to Banks 
 
6. (C) The limited exceptions to the withdrawal limits 
described above were not adequate to bail out most companies 
facing payroll on February 28.  Despite this, businesspeople 
were nervously optimistic that they would be able to pay 
their workers on time.  Garment firms, and other 
export-oriented industries, are paid in foreign exchange. 
These industries have cashed in some of their dollar reserves 
(at a relatively poor exchange rate) to get enough kyat to 
pay salaries.  Other firms with kyat revenues are following 
the same model, cashing in real assets or borrowing money 
from private lenders using these assets as collateral. 
Traders are cutting back on their purchases this week, at a 
cost to commerce, in order to conserve cash for payday.  The 
bottom line as of the end of February 28th, is that we\'ve not 
seen or heard any evidence that employers have failed to meet 
their obligations. 
 
7. (C) The mad dash to cash in dollars combined with people\'s 
high expectations and the disappointing reality have had a 
strong impact on the dollar/kyat market.  After dipping 
briefly to 800 kyat last week, the dollar recovered on 
expectations of firm government action, back up to 1060 on 
February 25.  When withdrawal limits did not come off, and 
when employers realized they were on their own, the dollar\'s 
value dropped rapidly to 950 kyat/dollar on February 27, 
where it remained through February 28. 
 
How Long Can it Last? 
 
8. (C) Economists, bankers, and businesspeople are unclear 
how long the crisis will last, though there is no optimism 
that a solution is in the offing.  Though Burma has suffered 
nearly every economic indignity imaginable, a banking crisis 
is relatively uncharted waters.  Bankers continue to hope 
that at a minimum the GOB will be willing to add new money to 
meet demands for liquidity.  Even the most optimistic 
observers, though, are less sure that the government will 
take the correct steps to fully heal the patient (e.g., by 
liberalizing the conditions under which the banks operate) 
when and if the bleeding is stanched.

1. (C) Summary: The regime has pulled the rug out from under 
the private banks, denying them any Central Bank credit. 
Though some reconfiguration of the banking system seems 
inevitable, the GOB has been mum so far on its exact 
intentions.  The longer the delay in action, the longer the 
country\'s economic paralysis will extend, and the bigger the 
mess the regime will inherit in the mid- to long- term.  End 
summary. 
 
GOB\'s Sleight of Hand 
 
2. (C) Accounts early last week of Central Bank loans to 
troubled private banks turned out to be totally false.  We 
reported that the Central Bank had extended loans of up to 53 
billion kyat (about $50 million) to the six most desperate 
banks in exchange for collateral (including the personal 
residences of their Chairmen).  In reality, the Finance 
Ministry had been leading the banks on with promises of loans 
if the collateral was right.  After a week of berating bank 
owners for incompetence and demanding in-depth assessments 
the banks\' various real properties, the Finance Ministry told 
assembled bankers on March 3rd that there would be no loans 
or other new money for anybody. 
 
The Run Continues 
 
3. (C) The banks are on their own.  Without GOB help, the 
short-term survival of the largest, and hardest hit, private 
banks (AWB and Yoma Bank) will depend on their ability to 
call in outstanding loans, bring in new (or return) deposits, 
and cash in on existing assets.  So far these efforts have 
largely failed.  According to economic sources, most 
borrowers, facing a cash crunch of their own, have refused to 
repay their loans, and some have even stopped making their 
regular interest payments.  Potential investors, even if they 
have the cash, are reluctant to buy up AWB\'s and Yoma\'s 
distressed assets for fear of coming under investigation for 
ties to \"criminal elements\" in the banking sector. 
 
4. (C) With things as they are now, the situation could 
rapidly go critical.  Despite increasingly smaller weekly 
withdrawal caps (now set at 100,000 kyat ($100) per week), 
roughly 230 billion kyat has fled the banks during the last 
two weeks.  Due to the tightening restrictions, total 
withdrawals for this week will slow to at most 18 billion 
kyat (down from 30 billion last week).  As the slow bleed 
continues, however, there is growing risk that some of the 
banks will start to run out of cash within the next week or 
so.  These failures could be delayed for several weeks, 
though, even without GOB help, if banks are more successful 
than they have been in cobbling together some new cash. 
 
Playing God with the Banks 
 
5. (C) The decision by the GOB, made at the highest levels, 
to withhold Central Bank credit lines clarifies earlier 
suspicions that the SPDC rulers have no love for the private 
banking system, and would like to see some or all of the 
existing private banks dead.  To this end, the GOB will 
apparently conduct thorough reviews of each banks\' loan 
portfolio and operations.  Though the Central Bank\'s twenty 
audit teams have yet to swing into action, the SPDC has 
allegedly assigned a mid-level military officer as a Cadre 
for each of the teams.  This inclusion of military officers 
is a sign that the final analyses of the banks may be based 
as much on political agendas than financial facts. 
 
6. (C) Assuming the regime has decided to review the banks\' 
operations, the timing of this next move is uncertain.  One 
economist guessed that the regime would wait until the first 
major bank runs out of cash before sending in the 
military-led audit teams.  In any event, the financial 
investigations will likely wait until Military Intelligence 
completes its own inquiries into allegations of embezzlement 
and illegal foreign exchange trading that hang over the heads 
of some top bankers. 
7. (C) It is equally hard to predict who the GOB will allow 
to remain standing when the dust clears.  If the auditors do 
their job properly, a bank\'s survival will depend primarily 
on the quality of its loan portfolio (now a big question 
mark) and the cleanliness of its daily operations.  However, 
the X-factor is the weight the GOB will give to politics and 
cronyism.  For example, while AWB (as the epicenter of the 
banking crisis) is a logical choice for destruction or 
dismantling, the bank has outstanding several large loans 
given to major construction firms for projects in which the 
GOB is involved.  KBZ Bank is a logical survivor, as the 
Chairman is close friends with Vice Senior General Maung Aye. 
 However, KBZ\'s lending practices are reportedly among the 
least sound of any of the privates. 
 
8. (C) One theme that we\'ve been hearing around town is 
merger.  Many are predicting that the regime will force the 
merger of many of the smaller private banks so that there is 
more competition and a better spread of deposits (before the 
crisis, AWB and Yoma together held about 65-70 percent of 
total deposits).  However, we have no solid evidence that the 
GOB is actually planning to do this, or, if so, when and how 
they plan to do it. 
 
The Future is Hazy 
 
9. (C) The GOB\'s decision not to make clear its intentions 
has left the banking and business community in a bitter mood. 
 No one debates the wisdom of doing an honest and thorough 
review of the banks and subsequently disposing appropriately 
of bad banks, bad loans, and bad bankers.  If done quickly 
and properly, this could be a good thing for the economy. 
However, the longer the government waits to take charge, the 
more expensive any final solution will be.  In addition, the 
longer the economic paralysis stemming from the banking 
crisis continues, the greater the damage to the already weak 
economy, and the increasing chance for some degree of social 
unrest.

Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  On February 28, ILO Liaison Officer Ms. 
Perret-Nguyen provided Emboffs with a status report on her 
efforts to engage the regime on forced labor before the ILO 
Governing Board meeting on Burma in late March.  Ms. 
Perret-Nguyen has been focusing on getting the regime to 
accept a plan of action on forced labor to present to the 
Governing Board.  To date, the regime has not agreed to 
include even minimally necessary elements in the plan of 
action such as a pilot project area or a mediator.  In 
addition, the military, the primary user of forced labor in 
Burma, still remains off limits to the government\'s 
implementation committee on forced labor.  Ms. Perret-Nguyen 
is encouraging the U.S. and others to impress upon the 
Burmese government the importance of providing at least a 
minimally acceptable plan of action to the GB.  Otherwise, 
she expects GB members will have run out of patience with 
regime delays and move to enforcing sanctions.  End Summary. 
 
No News is Bad News 
 
2. (C) ILO Liaison Officer Ms. Perret-Nguyen told Emboffs on 
February 28 that she is frustrated with the lack of progress 
on forced labor in Burma since her arrival in Rangoon six 
months ago.  Specifically, she said the Convention 29 
Implementation Committee the government established in 
response to the ILO\'s call for action on forced labor 
continues to be ineffectual and the government is dragging 
its feet on submitting a meaningful plan of action to the 
Governing Body. 
 
3. (C)  Perret-Nguyen said the Implementation Committee 
members are always polite and cordial to her but on substance 
there has been no progress.  She said that when she brings 
allegations of forced labor to the committee\'s attention it 
invariably reports back that there was no evidence to support 
the allegations or, if there was evidence, military 
operations were involved and the committee could not 
intervene.  She said that she continues to receive credible 
reports that forced labor continues unabated in all areas 
where the military is active.  Perret-Nguyen is convinced 
that the military commanders have not received any 
instructions on how to implement the 1999 and 2000 directives 
issued to curtail the use of forced labor, so they continue 
with past practices.  She said that the patience of the 
Governing Body with the regime\'s delays on taking action 
against forced labor are wearing thin and the government 
needs to provide clear evidence that it will put action 
behind its words at the March Governing Body meeting. 
 
Key Elements In Plan of Action 
 
4. (C)  Ms. Perret-Nguyen said she has worked hard to 
convince the regime of the benefits of a sound plan of action 
on forced labor but it has been very slow going.  She has 
focused on the following priorities: 1) the designation of a 
mediator or facilitator to receive complaints and liaise with 
the Implementation Committee; 2) an assessment of the 
complaints evaluation system; 3) a study of alternatives to 
the use of forced labor; 4) the reform of the system for 
inspections and allegation verifications;  5) a public 
information campaign; and 6) an ILO-funded pilot area. 
Perret-Nguyen said that although the ILO and the government 
have exchanged drafts of a proposed work plan they are \"no 
where near\" agreement on a text.  She said her encouragement 
that when the regime begins to show action on the problem 
assistance will be forthcoming appears to be falling on deaf 
ears. 
 
5. (C)  As the Governing Body meeting draws near, 
Perret-Nguyen has honed in on obtaining a minimally 
acceptable plan of action from the government just to have 
something to show at the meeting.  Her office would not claim 
that this minimal plan is sufficient but it would give the GB 
something to review.  Her bottom line on a \"minimally 
acceptable\" plan would include the creation of a mediator and 
the acceptance of a pilot project, points the government has 
not yet been willing to accept.  She said that even if the GB 
determines that this minimal plan is not good enough, she 
could use that feedback to push for a better plan. 
 
Last Ditch Efforts? 
 
6. (C)  Perret-Nguyen said she hopes the regime relents at 
the last minute and agrees to the minimally acceptable plan 
of action, noting that the regime has a history of responding 
to the ILO officials when they are at the airport about to 
leave Rangoon.  For example, she said, when she was departing 
for Geneva for the last GB meeting, the regime presented her 
with three points or concessions to address ILO concerns. 
(Note: One of these was to appoint a representative of the 
Inspector General\'s office to the Implementation Committee in 
order to provide the committee with a link to military 
authorities; this appointment never materialized according to 
Perret-Nguyen.  End Note.) She said she hopes the regime will 
do the same this time and present her with the minimally 
acceptable work plan just before she leaves town.  She is not 
convinced, however, that the regime understands the 
importance of delivering a plan of action to the GB meeting. 
She senses that either the regime does not understand that GB 
patience for continued delays has run out or that it does not 
care.  She requested that the U.S. provide any support it can 
prior to the GB meeting to impress upon the Burmese that it 
is time for action on forced labor.  She said she has 
approached others in the diplomatic community to support her 
efforts.  If the regime does not accept at least some of the 
ILO\'s recommendations for the plan of action, Perret-Nguyen 
believes the GB will toughen its stance and revisit 
implementation of sanctions agreed to in 2000 but held in 
abeyance pending actions by the regime. 
 
7. (C)  Comment:  The Chief of Mission will meet with the 
Minister of Labor to impress upon him the importance of 
demonstrating to the GB the regime\'s commitment to addressing 
forced labor.  We will point out the benefits of a pilot 
project and a mediator, and encourage an improved 
investigation and enforcement mechanism.  Unfortunately, it 
is likely that the Minister of Labor understands these issues 
all too well but is not in a position to determine whether or 
not to cooperate with the ILO.  The junta\'s military leaders 
dictate these matters and they have a long-held vested 
interest in using forced labor to support the military 
infrastructure.  Perret-Nguyen noted that the military 
continues to remain outside the Implementation Committee and 
does not appear to have any commitment to reducing forced 
labor.  Until this changes, we can expect cooperation with 
the ILO mission to be slow at best. End Comment.

1. (C) A reliable source with very close personal ties to top 
military medical officers corroborated recent DAO Rangoon 
reports that Vice Senior General Maung Aye has been 
hospitalized.  Our source indicated, though, that Maung Aye 
had been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer that is not 
treatable in Burma.  The source hypothesized that the SPDC 
Vice Chairman would soon be sent to Singapore for treatment. 
 
2. (C) Comment: The apparent serious illness of Maung Aye 
leads us to begin speculation on an SPDC without its current 
second-in-command.  The obvious choice of successor based on 
rank and seniority is General Khin Nyunt (now Secretary One). 
 However, according to one former army officer, it would be 
unprecedented for a military intelligence officer (who is 
also not a graduate of the Defense Service Academy) to take 
over as Deputy Commander-in-Chief.  The other major players 
in the SPDC now are reportedly too junior to be considered 
for the Deputy position.  Thus, the structure of a Burmese 
regime sans Maung Aye could look much different than it 
currently does.  We doubt, though, whether policy would 
change significantly.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA: THIRD ANNUAL TIP REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 22225 
 
1. (SBU) The following report responds to the checklist 
provided in reftel requesting information on trafficking in 
persons activities in Burma.  The report will also be 
forwarded to EAP/BCLTV in Word format. 
 
Begin Report: 
 
Overview of Country\'s Activities - 
 
A. Burma is a country of origin for international trafficking 
of men, women, and children, primarily for sexual 
exploitation but also for labor exploitation.  Internal 
trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labor also 
occurs throughout the country.  There are no reliable 
estimates of the magnitude of the international or internal 
trafficking.  The government does not effectively collect 
such information and, due to strict government controls over 
information flow, there are no independent assessments of the 
problem.  The government estimates that only 46 women were 
trafficked to Thailand in 2002, for instance, while other 
sources generally estimate that there are thousands of 
trafficking victims to Thailand each year.  Sources for 
information on trafficking include government affiliated 
non-governmental organizations, international 
non-governmental organizations, UN offices in Burma, and 
international non-governmental organizations in Thailand. 
Women and girls are the primary international trafficking and 
internal sex trafficking victims while internal forced labor 
trafficking appears to include victims of all ages and both 
sexes. 
 
B.  Internationally, Burmese men, women, and children are 
trafficked primarily to Thailand but also reportedly to 
China, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan. 
Internally, sex trafficking of women and girls occurs from 
villages throughout the country to urban centers and to other 
centers for prostitution such as trucking crossroads, fishing 
villages, border towns, and mining and military camps. 
 
C.  There has been no discernible change in the direction or 
extent of trafficking in recent years, although, as 
mentioned, there is no effective monitoring of the problem. 
 
D.  The Myanmar National Working Committee on Women\'s Affairs 
(MNCWA), a self-sustaining (does not receive government 
funding) government organization, in conjunction with the UN 
Interagency Project on Trafficking in the Sub-Mekong Region 
(UN-IAP) plans to collect data on trafficking in selected 
townships this year.  The results of this survey are not 
available for this year\'s report.  On the extent of forced 
labor in the country, the International Labor Office believes 
that it still occurs wherever the military has a presence, 
but there is no accurate estimate of the number of victims 
per year. 
 
E.  Burma is not a destination country for trafficking in 
persons. 
 
F.  Poverty is the driving force behind trafficking in 
persons for sex and exploitative labor practices in Burma. 
Victims are either attempting to make a better living for 
themselves or, more commonly, attempting to make money to 
provide a better standard of living to their family.  Young 
girls in families are the most common targets.  The 
traffickers at the village level are often older women who 
provide \"a connection\" for the local girls.  Once out of the 
village the girls may pass through several brokers before 
they end up in a brothel in another part of Burma or in a 
foreign country (most frequently Thailand).  Victims are 
generally trafficked by the cheapest means available, in the 
back of trucks or in buses.  Because of tight controls over 
travel near border areas, victims would typically require 
false documentation or bribes to make it through military, 
immigration, and customs check-points, or through the many 
\"unofficial\" border crossings controlled by cease-fire and 
anti-government groups. 
 
G.  During the year, the government has greatly increased its 
commitment to combating sex trafficking, focusing on media 
awareness campaigns and the arrest and prosecution of 
traffickers.  On the issue of forced labor, however, the 
government has continued to do the minimal necessary to avoid 
the implementation of sanctions by ILO member organizations. 
A particularly sensitive aspect of the military\'s continuing 
use of forced labor is the use of forcibly conscripted child 
soldiers, a practice that has been highlighted in the press, 
which continues but is difficult to quantify, and which the 
government denies.  There have been no prosecutions to our 
knowledge of government officials linked to TIP or against 
Army personnel involved in forced labor.  It is very 
difficult to identify any funding specifically allocated for 
TIP.  The government generally tasks groups to achieve policy 
initiatives without providing sufficient funding.  For 
instance, the most active government organization on sexual 
trafficking, the MNCWA, is \"self-sustaining,\" meaning it 
depends on donations and volunteers to implement its 
programs. 
 
H.  Yes, there is undoubtedly some complicity of government 
officials in sexual trafficking, although it is probably 
limited to local or regional officials attempting to 
supplement meager salaries by turning a blind eye to 
trafficking activities.  There are some reports that Military 
Intelligence (the internal intelligence service) controls 
some brothels and, by extension, would be involved in 
trafficking.  We do not have reliable information on the 
extent to which this is happening.  Military officials and 
township officials are directly involved in trafficking for 
forced labor inside the country.  This practice remains 
common throughout the country, but is worst in the border 
areas.  We are aware of no prosecutions of government 
officials for either sex or forced labor trafficking. 
 
I.  The government\'s ability to address sex trafficking is 
limited by the lack of funding allocated for social programs. 
 Burma is among the lowest ranked countries in the world for 
per capita expenditures on health and education services, for 
instance.  The government over the past 14 years has 
drastically cut funding for social services in order to fund 
military priorities.  This trend continues still. Also, 
because of the government\'s serious economic mismanagement, 
poverty and widespread corruption have become the norm. 
Economic desperation is continually cited as the root cause 
of sex trafficking in the country; people do things they 
would not have considered if they had better economic 
opportunities. 
 
Prevention: 
 
A.  Yes, the government this year has begun to acknowledge 
that sex trafficking is a serious problem.  However, the 
government has not publicly acknowledged, especially inside 
the country, that forced labor continues to be a serious 
problem. 
 
B.  The Ministry of Home Affairs is the lead agency in 
anti-trafficking actions for sexual trafficking with support 
from the Ministries of Social Welfare, Immigration, and 
Labor, the Supreme Court, and the Attorney General.  The 
Labor Ministry is the lead agency on forced labor. 
 
C.  Yes, the MNCWA has conducted seminars, produced and shown 
videotapes on television, and developed radio programs 
highlighting the perils of trafficking.  On forced labor, the 
government has posted in public places directives issued in 
1999 and 2000 prohibiting the use of forced labor.  There has 
been no assessment of the effectiveness of the sexual 
trafficking awareness campaign.  Forced labor appears to be 
continuing unabated in spite of the posting of the directives 
against it. 
D.  Although the MNCWA and other social services 
organizations have programs to provide women with income 
generating skills and to encourage women to take a greater 
role in the community, these programs are dwarfed by the 
desperate conditions of most women in the country.  Given the 
government\'s absence of funding for these programs (they are 
largely \"self-sustaining\"), they reach only a small 
percentage of the women in need. 
 
E.  Prevention has been the focus of the government\'s efforts 
this year, with public awareness campaigns, workshops, and 
township \"talks.\"  There is no specific budget for these 
activities, however, they are just included in the policy 
programming of relevant Ministries and organizations within 
existing resources. 
 
F.  The government attempts to control \"civil society\" and 
ensure that all citizens support the policies of the regime. 
Local township organizations are extensions of the military 
junta and use a combination of a spoils system and 
intimidation to ensure support for government policies.  As a 
result, the citizenry generally attempts to minimize its 
contacts with these organizations.  On the issue of 
trafficking, citizens are encouraged to attend workshops and 
talks in order to show support for the government policies. 
Because these government programs are self-sustaining, 
citizens are, at least in some cases, also required to make 
cash \"donations\" to support the programs. 
 
G.  The borders with neighboring countries are porous.  While 
the government controls numerous official border crossings, 
there are probably hundreds of other crossings under the 
control of cease-fire groups, anti-government groups, and 
smugglers.  We are not aware of any monitoring of immigration 
or emigration patterns, or the analysis of this data for 
patterns of trafficking. 
 
H.  Yes, there is a multi-agency task force under the 
guidance of the Home Ministry to address sexual trafficking 
in persons and a Convention 29 Implementation Committee under 
the Ministry of Labor to address forced labor.  (See 
Prevention - B.)  There is no public corruption task force. 
 
I.  The MNCWA participates in regional and world conferences 
on women\'s issues, including trafficking.  However, there has 
not been any regional coordination on specific interventions 
to prevent, monitor, or control sex trafficking. 
 
J.  Yes, there is a national plan to address sexual 
trafficking in persons, which has been disseminated by hand. 
The MNCWA developed the plan in coordination with the 
relevant ministries including Social Welfare, Immigration, 
and Home Affairs.  The plan was not coordinated with 
international NGO\'s working on TIP.  There is no national 
plan to address the issue of forced labor. 
 
K.  The Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, Brigadier General 
Thura Myint Maung, is the Chairman of the Human Trafficking 
Prevention Work Committee.  The Minister of Labor is the 
person responsible for addressing forced labor. 
 
Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers: 
 
A.  No, there is no law specifically prohibiting trafficking 
in persons.  As was the case last year, the laws used to 
prosecute human traffickers are a combination of laws against 
kidnapping and prostitution.  The government is considering 
whether to adopt new legislation specifically addressing 
trafficking in persons but a decision is still pending.  The 
Attorney General\'s office said it believes existing laws are 
adequate to prosecute traffickers while the Ministry of Home 
Affairs stated a new law may be necessary. 
B.  Sentences for trafficking in persons have ranged from 
five to twelve years, with most cases carrying a sentence of 
seven years imprisonment. 
C.  Penalties for prostitution are up to ten years 
imprisonment, sexual assault of an adult is up to two years, 
and sexual assault of a minor is up to ten years. 
 
D.  The government states that it has prosecuted 93 cases 
against human traffickers.  It states that it has arrested 
160 trafficking brokers.  It has provided the Embassy and 
G/TIP with extracts of 30 of the prosecutions.  Some of these 
prosecutions appear to be against traffickers while others 
appear to be against migrant smugglers.  There have been no 
prosecutions relating to forced labor. 
 
E.  Human trafficking for sexual exploitation appears to be 
primarily small-scale operations using village contacts that 
feed into more established trafficking \"brokers.\"  There is 
no evidence of travel or tourism agencies being involved in 
the trafficking.  We have no information on where profits 
from this kind of trafficking end up.  Human trafficking 
relating to forced labor is directed by the military and 
supported by township officials who arrange to meet the 
military\'s requirements. 
 
F.  The prosecutions of traffickers that we have reviewed 
indicate that most arrests occur as the result of \"tip-offs\" 
to local police rather than investigations.  While the 
government maintains extensive and intrusive controls over 
the population, trafficking in humans is not the target of 
these efforts. 
 
G.  The government does not provide this specialized training 
but the UN-IAP has conducted workshops that touch on this 
aspect of trafficking. 
 
H.  No, there is no evidence that the government is 
cooperating with other governments on the investigation and 
prosecution of trafficking cases.  When G/TIP and Emboff 
recommended greater cooperation with Thailand on this issue, 
government officials were non-committal. 
 
I.  No, there have been no extraditions of human traffickers 
to other countries.  Burmese law prevents the extradition of 
nationals except under exceptional circumstances. 
 
J/K.  Given the pervasive government control that exists over 
the activities of all citizens, there has to be some 
tolerance and/or collusion of government officials in sexual 
human trafficking in order for the practice to continue on a 
large scale.  The National Committee Against Human 
Trafficking told G/TIP and Emboff, however, that there have 
been no arrests or prosecutions of government officials 
involved in trafficking.  On forced labor, the military is 
the driving force behind the practice, and there have been no 
related arrests or prosecutions. 
 
L.  No, the government has not signed any of these 
international instruments. 
 
Protection and Assistance to Victims 
 
A.  The MNCWA and the Ministry of Social Welfare assist 
returning trafficking victims.  The assistance largely 
consists of counseling and job training at care centers 
before the women are returned to their families.  The MNCWA 
states that in 2002 a total of 15 victims were counseled at 
these facilities before being returned to their families, 
while 122 victims were transferred directly back to their 
families. 
 
B.  No, the government does not provide funding to foreign or 
domestic NGOs for services to victims.  Foreign NGOs have 
provided some services and support to the government and 
local NGOs beginning this year.  For the first time, 
international NGOs have coordinated a limited number of 
victim repatriations with the government and local NGOs and 
provided public awareness materials to the government 
(pamphlets to the Ministry of Home Affairs at its request). 
 
C.  There appears to be a growing understanding of the need 
to protect victims, especially those returning from 
international trafficking.  We have heard of no returning 
victims being arrested or jailed. 
 
D.  There has not been much focus on this aspect of sexual 
human trafficking in public awareness campaigns to date and 
we know of no case in which the victims have filed suit 
against traffickers.  In the area of forced labor, victims do 
not have an adequate mechanism for lodging complaints or 
seeking prosecutions. 
 
E.  We do not have any information on the level of protection 
the government can or does provide witnesses in trafficking 
cases. 
 
F.  The UN-IAP has established an excellent workshop for 
government officials on the recognition and provision of 
assistance to victims of sexual human trafficking.  The 
workshops are intended to be self-sustaining, with government 
officials becoming the workshop trainers.  The workshops 
appear to be very effective and are being offered to an 
ever-expanding number of officials who interface with the 
trafficking issue (police, social workers, immigration 
officials, etc.).  The training has not been provided to 
Burmese Embassy staff in other countries and we have no 
information that these staff have instructions on engaging 
with NGOs working with trafficking victims.

E.O. 12958:    N/A 
TAGS: CVIS, CMGT, BM 
SUBJECT: VISA BANS: A COMPARISON OF U.S. AND E.U. POLICIES 
IN BURMA 
 
1. SUMMARY: An analysis of American and E.U. visa policies 
toward Burmese \"who formulate, implement, or benefit from 
policies that impede Burma\'s transition to democracy\" shows 
that American and E.U. consular officials refuse to issue 
visas to more or less the same people, but sometimes for 
different reasons.  Although the two approaches yield 
similar results, the American system is more flexible and 
easier to implement. END SUMMARY. 
 
The U.S. Visa Ban 
----------------- 
 
2.  A 1996 Presidential Proclamation bans entry into the 
United States, as immigrant or non-immigrants, of senior 
Burmese government officials and \"other persons who 
formulate, implement, or benefit from policies that impede 
Burma\'s transition to democracy\" and their immediate family 
members.   Such persons are ineligible to receive visas 
under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Section 
212(f). 
 
3. Individuals in the following categories (and their 
immediate families) are subject to INA Section 212(f): 
-- State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) members; 
-- Government ministers; 
-- Senior officials of the Union Solidarity and Development 
Association (USDA); 
-- Other senior government officials above the rank of 
colonel or director general. 
 
These categories overlap to a large extent.  For example, 
the Minister of Defense is an SPDC member and USDA senior 
officials are either SPDC members or cabinet ministers. 
Some ministers and all SPDC members are generals. 
 
4.  These categories are enumerated for ease in 
implementation; however, the ban is not limited to 
individuals who fall within these categories.  Any other 
person \"who formulates, implements, or benefits from 
policies that impede Burma\'s transition to democracy\" could 
be found ineligible to receive a visa under Section 212(f). 
 
5.  For practical reasons, the U.S. ban does not identify 
specific individuals, but rather, categories of applicants 
ineligible under 212(f).  U.S. embassies and consulates 
accept visa applications from any applicant physically 
present in their consular districts.  Consular sections 
around the world could not be expected to recognize specific 
individuals.  Any Burmese applicant who lists a rank above 
colonel or a title above director general on his/her visa 
application should be refused, regardless of where they 
apply.  Also, the Burmese government often makes dramatic 
personnel changes at the senior levels, which may or may not 
be widely or promptly reported.  Maintaining an up-to-date 
list of individuals ineligible under Section 212(f) would be 
time-consuming and difficult. 
 
The E.U. Visa Ban 
----------------- 
 
6.  The E.U. annually develops a list of specific Burmese 
officials who are ineligible to receive visas.  Their list 
could be divided into the following categories: 
-- SPDC members; 
-- Potential SPDC members: 
-- Regional commanders; 
-- Cabinet ministers (includes deputy ministers); 
 
7.  All of the individuals listed by the British Embassy in 
July 2002 fall into one or more of the categories used to 
implement the U.S. visa ban.  However, some Burmese 
officials that might fall into the U.S. catch-all category 
of \"other senior government officials above the rank of 
colonel or director general\" may not be specifically named 
on the E.U. list (e.g., not all generals are SPDC, regional 
commanders, or cabinet ministers). 
 
The E.U. Proposal 
----------------- 
 
8.  The E.U. proposes to expand their list to include senior 
members of the USDA and \"certain other individuals who 
formulate, implement, or benefit from policies that impede 
Burma/Myanmar\'s transition to democracy, and their 
families.\"  This last category would include senior 
officials of the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Limited 
(UMEHL) and companies owned by UMEHL, prominent bankers and 
other \"cronies.\" 
 
9.  Their proposed wording is virtually identical to the 
wording of the Presidential Proclamation.  Thus, individual 
businessmen specified on the E.U. list could also be found 
ineligible to receive a visa under INA Section 212(f). 
Although we might, in fact, refuse the same people, our 
justification would be slightly different.  For example, 
many UMEHL officials are retired generals and/or ministers 
who the government rewarded for their services to the 
regime.  Whereas the E.U. might refuse such UMEHL officials 
as \"cronies,\" we might refuse them for having been career 
beneficiaries of regime policies. 
 
10.  On a practical level, identifying all persons who 
\"benefit from policies that impede Burma/Myanmar\'s 
transition to democracy\" is an impossible task.  Such a list 
could only include the most conspicuous beneficiaries of 
government policies.  \"Behind-the-scene\" beneficiaries could 
travel freely.  Even if Western diplomats were able to 
develop a comprehensive list of beneficiaries/cronies, it 
would need to be constantly updated.  For example, prominent 
private bankers who many would have considered \"cronies\" 
three months ago, might not be considered so today.  In 
fact, several of the bankers/businessmen on the E.U.\'s 
proposed list might now be ineligible under INA Section 
214(b) (presumed immigrant intent), rather than under 
Section 212(f).

SUBJECT: OPIUM CULTIVATION DOWN SHARPLY IN BURMA 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: According to UNODC experts, Burma\'s notorious 
Kokang Region is now free of opium.  So is northern Shan 
State from Kutkai to Muse.  According to UNODC\'s opium 
surveyors, preliminary indications from the data they have 
collected throughout Shan State suggest that the area under 
opium cultivation in Burma may be reduced by as much as 30 to 
50 percent this year, despite excellent weather throughout 
the opium growing territories.  Yields, however, will be 
higher and it is still too soon to say whether the overall 
crop will be higher or lower.  According to UNODC, former 
poppy farmers from the opium-free areas are on the move 
throughout Shan State, seeking work and food for their 
families.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Jeremy Milsom, who is supervising UNODC\'s survey of 
opium production in Burma, told poloff on March 11 that the 
GOB\'s efforts to curtail opium production had had a major 
impact in 2003.  According to Milsom the Kokang region and 
all of northern Shan State from Kutkai to Muse was free of 
opium.  UNODC teams had been through all of those areas and 
had found no opium at all.  UNODC saw no evidence of opium in 
Shan State Special Region No. 4 around Mong La, which had 
declared itself opium-free in 1997.  Milsom said that UNODC 
was still compiling its date for central, eastern, and 
southern Shan State and that it was still hard to estimate 
the overall reduction in opium acreage throughout Shan State. 
 Nevertheless, an initial survey of the data suggested that 
the overall reduction could be in the range of 30 to 50 
percent of last year\'s 80,000 hectare crop. 
 
3. (C) On the downside, Milsom said that there was not much 
reduction of opium acreage in the Wa territories, which were 
now the only region in Burma where there was any latitude at 
all for opium cultivation.  (The Wa are pledged to end opium 
production in 2005.)  Even there, however, UNODC was able to 
verify that townships around the Wa heartland of Mong Maw and 
its capital of Pang Sang were free of opium.  Ironically, 
Milsom noted, in the past, outside observers had always 
attributed a majority of Burma\'s opium production to the Wa 
territories, even though surveys had regularly shown 
production in the Wa territories to be only 20 to 25 percent 
of Burma\'s whole crop.  This year, however, with the 
reduction in the other cease-fire areas and in government 
controlled territories, the Wa could indeed end up producing 
a majority of Burma\'s opium. 
 
4. (C) Milsom also noted that yields were definitely higher 
this year, thanks to timely rains in November and December. 
As a result, it was still too early to say whether the 
overall opium crop in Burma would be higher or lower than 
last year.  If the increase in yield offsets the decline in 
acreage, it would be higher; otherwise it would be lower. 
 
5. (C) Finally, Milsom noted that the impact of the end of 
opium production was being felt throughout northern Shan 
State.  Former opium farmers were flocking into the Wa 
territories seeking work to support their families. 
Fortunately, the rice crop this year in the Wa territories 
was excellent and there was work.  In future months and 
years, however, the fate of these farmers and their families 
will depend on what alternatives they find to opium 
production. 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C) Two points are worth making here.  First, if these 
preliminary indications hold up, the Burmese may, in fact, 
reduce acreage under cultivation even in a good weather year. 
 This year the weather has been excellent and prime growing 
areas like the Kokang region, Kutkai, and Muse are all free 
of opium, essentially as a result of firm GOB enforcement 
actions.  Weather had little, if anything, to do with those 
changes. 
 
7. (C) Secondly, the former opium poppy farmers now searching 
for the means of livelihood in Shan State need the support of 
the GOB and the international community.  The international 
community can and should provide more assistance for 
alternative development programs that will give these farmers 
options.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS: PASSING THE BUCK ON TO BORROWERS 
 
REF: RANGOON 299 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The GOB has settled on a response to the 
banking crisis that will likely just expedite the disaster it 
is ostensibly trying to avoid.  The regime, through a 
military-run committee, demanded that banks restore liquidity 
by calling in loans.  With the economy at a standstill, many 
businesses will now have to make their March payrolls while 
under increasing pressure from the banks and Military 
Intelligence for prepayment of loans.  End summary. 
 
The GOB\'s \"Market-Based\" Solution 
 
2. (C) After early hints that the regime might rescue Burma\'s 
troubled banks with Central Bank loans, it has instead 
settled on a \"solution\" to the private banks liquidity 
problems that throws the burden on to business and other 
borrowers.  The first step down this path came with the 
formation in early March of the \"Private Bank Management 
Committee,\" chaired by politically influential SPDC member 
Quartermaster General Lieutenant General Tin Aung Myin Oo. 
The regime charged this Committee, which also includes top 
Finance Ministry and Central Bank officials, to work closely 
with Military Intelligence (MI) to resolve the problems in 
the banks. 
 
3. (C) The Committee directed that banks rebuild their cash 
position through early repayment of loans.  Repayments are to 
occur according to a rigid timetable, with 40 percent of 
outstanding loans due by the end of April.  Not all borrowers 
are subject to the Committee\'s fiat, though.  According to 
one banker, while his bank had to provide a list of large 
borrowers (of 50 million kyat -- about $50,000 -- and up), 
AWB (the locus of the banking crisis) had to submit data on 
all of its borrowers to the Committee.  Those borrowers who 
are reluctant or unable to pony up the called loans will 
probably have to answer to MI, one banker suggested. 
 
Business Shoulders the Burden 
 
4. (C) Local businesspeople, meanwhile, are shaking their 
heads at the GOB\'s decision to make them responsible for the 
resolution of the banks\' problems.  Most companies are 
already staggering under the weight of the credit crunch 
(private bank loans have not been granted since the start of 
the crisis) and the inability to draw fully on deposit 
accounts in various private banks.  The cash flow problems 
afflicting many businesses will only be exacerbated by the 
new obligation to repay nearly half of outstanding loans 
(including even mortgage loans) in short order.  Reflecting 
these concerns, and the current scramble for kyat, the value 
of the dollar has dropped nearly 13 percent in value against 
the kyat since March 1 (bottoming out at 840 kyat/dollar on 
March 14), and the spot value of gold fell an additional 2.25 
percent in the week ending March 14.  Depressed asset prices 
will add an additional burden to businesses trying to offload 
some of their property to make ends meet. 
 
5. (C) Meanwhile, while borrowers tremble, the situation for 
some banks may be stabilizing.  With withdrawal limits for 
each depositor steady at 100,000 kyat/week, the private banks 
still face a maximum outflow of only 18 billion kyat/week. 
One official at a large bank told us that his institution had 
been able, between new deposits and hastened loan repayments, 
to counteract withdrawals and even witness a small net 
improvement in its cash position during the week ending March 
14.  However, this situation is tenuous at best. 
Additionally, total deposits have continued to decline -- a 
sure sign of fading public confidence in the banks. 
 
Asking for Trouble 
 
6. (C) The GOB\'s curious policy decision, which simply 
encourages the banking crisis to infect the broader economy, 
is, of course, exactly the opposite of what most Central 
Banks do when faced with a bank run.  Normally Central Banks 
do back flips to avoid calling loans because of the negative 
spillover effects such actions have.  In Burma, however, that 
most shunned of options has become the government\'s policy 
choice.  Presumably this is because the GOB fears the 
inflationary impact of bailing out the private banks. 
However, the net result of this decision is just to spread 
the pain from one set of innocent bystanders (the depositors) 
to another (the borrowers).  In no way does this help. 
 
7. (C) Hopefully, the government will take another look at 
this approach.  In any case, however, it is becoming 
increasingly apparent that the entire catastrophe will have 
at least two results.  First, more and more of the economy 
will go underground, the only place where credit is available 
and trade can now transpire.  Even when the banking mess is 
cleaned up, most commerce may remain in the shadows, having 
learned its lesson on the hazards of doing business in the 
daylight.  Second, the short-term future for companies, their 
employees, and the economy as a whole, is imperiled.  At the 
end of March, already weak firms, faced with payroll and 
accelerated loan payments, could easily go under or be forced 
to lay off thousands of workers -- with potentially serious 
social consequences.  And, if they survive March, they may 
have to do the whole dance again in April (and every month 
thereafter).  Not a pleasant prospect for anyone in business 
in Burma these days.

SUBJECT: LABOR MINISTER REJECTS ILO ACTION PLAN 
 
REF: RANGOON 300 
 
1. (SBU)  COM Martinez met with Labor Minister Tin Winn on 
March 18 to encourage greater Burmese cooperation with the 
ILO on forced labor.  Specifically, the COM urged the 
Minister to accept Rangoon ILO Liaison Officer Ms. 
Perret-Nguyen\'s recommendations for a plan of action to be 
presented at the ILO Governing Body on March 26-27.  While 
Tin Winn said he has worked closely with Ms. Perret-Nguyen on 
the proposed plan of action, his government could not accept 
elements of the plan that she deemed essential for a 
minimally acceptable presentation to the GB.  Tin Winn said 
his government would not accept the concept of a \"mediator\" 
empowered to receive and follow-up complaints regarding 
forced labor.  He also rejected the idea of a pilot region 
where forced labor would be strictly prohibited and 
alternatives explored because, as envisioned by the ILO, the 
mediator would play a central role in the pilot region. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Responding to COM\'s recommendation that the 
government\'s implementation committee against forced labor 
needed a representative from the army (the largest user of 
forced labor in the country), Tin Winn said the government 
considered putting a representative from the military 
Inspector General\'s office on the Committee but decided a 
military intelligence officer with experience in 
international relations would be more appropriate.  Minister 
Tin Winn said the Burmese government has adequate mechanisms 
in place for receiving and investigations of complaints of 
forced labor and adequate laws for prosecution when 
necessary.  The Labor Minister emphasized that the GOB will 
continue to focus on public awareness campaigns to ensure 
that citizens understand that forced labor is not legal.  He 
dismissed the COM\'s comments that most victims of forced 
labor remained fearful of reporting abuses. 
 
3. (SBU)  Later the same day, ILO Liaison Officer Ms. 
Perret-Nguyen told COM that, on the eve of her departure for 
the GB meeting in Geneva, she was very discouraged by the 
government\'s intransigence on even the minimal elements 
necessary for a meaningful plan of action.  Ms. Perret-Nguyen 
said the GOB appears to have reached a critical juncture on 
the issue of forced labor; it does not know how to wean 
itself off of a dependency on forced labor yet it is 
unwilling to allow the ILO, or any outsiders, the necessary 
access to help solve the problem.  She said that in a meeting 
on March 5th, the Labor Minister asked if GOB acceptance of 
the two minimally required elements she was proposing to 
include in the action plan would satisfy the GB.  When she 
responded that the GB would probably ask for more steps to be 
taken (but she would work together with the GOB to address 
these concerns), the Minister said that there was no 
incentive for the GOB to accept these minimal elements if 
more requirements were to follow.  Perret-Nguyen said that 
the Minister appeared to be in the difficult position of 
attempting to appease the ILO without allowing real changes 
(i.e., greater transparency) that he knew Senior General Than 
Shwe and other memebrs of the military leadership would 
reject.  As it stands now, she said, she cannot endorse the 
government\'s plan and she expects that the GB will be quite 
critical of it.

AND MANDALAY RALLY 
 
 
Classified By: DCM RON MCMULLEN FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  On March 18, NLD Central Executive 
Committee members told Embassy officials that the SPDC 
included 3 NLD prisoners in the 45 prisoners released on 
March 16.  However, the NLD also charged that the SPDC 
continues to condone, if not direct, harassment of the NLD 
and Aung San Suu Kyi.  The prisoner releases are the first 
since last November and are probably linked to Special 
Rapporteur Pinheiro\'s visit this week.  End Summary. 
 
Three NLD Prisoners Released 
 
2. (SBU)  On March 16, the SPDC announced the release of 45 
prisoners described as \"elder inmates, females, either 
pregnant or with young children, and those incarcerated for 
disturbing peace and tranquility.\"  The announcement was 
provided to the local press but, as far as we have 
ascertained, not to the diplomatic community.  The SPDC has 
made similar releases of pregnant women and women with 
children over the past year at the request of Special 
Rapporteur for Human Rights Sergio Pinheiro.  With Pinheiro 
arriving in Rangoon on March 19, it may be that the prisoner 
release was motivated by his visit, although the SPDC has not 
made the connection explicit. 
 
3. (C)  According to NLD CEC members, there were 3 NLD 
members among those released.  One of the NLD prisoners is 
elderly and another has epilepsy, according to the NLD, so 
the organization was pleased to have them out of prison. 
That said, the CEC members went on to note that these are the 
first NLD prisoners released since last November and that 
there are many other elderly and sick NLD prisoners still in 
prison.  NLD Secretary U Lwin also stated that the identities 
of the 115 prisoners the regime claims to have released in 
November have never been clarified. 
 
Pamphlets Attack ASSK and Authorities Harass NLD Members 
 
4. (C)  The NLD CEC members said that the distribution of 
defamatory pamphlets against Aung San Suu Kyi continues at 
many locations throughout the country.  The NLD leaders found 
it implausible that the regime cannot identify those 
distributing the pamphlets when it closely monitors all 
citizens\' activities, especially the publishing and 
distribution of written materials. 
 
5. (C)  The NLD leaders said that, since February, there has 
also been an increase in repression against NLD members at 
locations throughout the country.  They cited the following 
examples: a) authorities discouraged NLD members from working 
at the NLD office in Kawthaung, the southernmost town in 
Burma; b) an NLD Member of Parliament elect in southern Shan 
State was told by local authorities to resign from a position 
he held at a local monastery; and c) authorities in Bago 
questioned and harassed the landlord of the NLD office there. 
 NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe argued that while local officials 
took these actions against NLD members, they may have been 
done at the direction of central authorities.  U Aung Shwe 
noted in particular that in some of the locations where 
harassment is occurring relations between the NLD and local 
authorities have traditionally been good. 
 
Ex-members and USDA Hold Anti-NLD Rally in Mandalay 
 
6. (C)  The NLD CEC members said recent press reports 
regarding an anti-NLD rally in Mandalay on March 9 were true. 
 Two ex-NLD members organized the rally with support from 
Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) members. 
The rally denouncing the NLD was held in Kanaung Hall, which 
is owned by Minister of Industry-1 Aung Thaung; a former a 
Military Intelligence officer and current USDA official. 
 
7. (C)  Comment:  The release of the 45 prisoners, including 
the 3 NLD members, is probably directly linked to Special 
Rapporteur Pinheiro\'s visit this week.  Pinheiro will almost 
certainly urge the regime to release the political prisoners 
as soon as possible, as he has often done in the past. 
Whether these urgings will have any more impact than they 
have in the recent past remains to be seen, particularly in 
view of the NLD\'s allegations of increased regime harassment. 
 End Comment.

1. (SBU)  Summary:  On March 20, UN Special Rapporteur 
Pinheiro briefed the U.S., EU, Japanese, and Australian 
Ambassadors on his current visit to Burma.  Pinheiro said the 
6-day visit is to update information prior to his March 31 
presentation to the UN Human Rights Committee and to request 
government approval for a human rights assessment team to 
visit Burma.  Pinheiro stated that his impression was that 
since his last visit in November, there has been no real 
progress on basic freedoms in Burma and, in fact, there had 
been some negative developments.  He told COM privately after 
the meeting that he was increasingly frustrated with the lack 
of progress on human rights and that he does not have any 
indication that the regime is sincere about reforms.  End 
Summary. 
 
Overall Assessment - Poor 
 
2. (C)  UN Special Rapporteur briefed the U.S., EU, Japanese, 
and Australian Ambassadors on March 20 on his current visit 
to Burma, asking for their impressions of recent developments 
on human rights in the country.  Pinheiro said his impression 
is that there has been no progress on basic freedoms since 
his last visit in November 2002 and, in fact, he believes 
there have been some negative developments.  He cited as 
examples the increase in harassment of the NLD and Aung San 
Suu Kyi, the lack of cooperation with the ILO on forced 
labor, and the failure to release any political prisoners 
until just days before his visit.  Pinheiro said it is 
becoming increasingly apparent to him that the SPDC does not 
want dialogue with the NLD at this time.  Meanwhile, he said, 
the SPDC\'s recent diplomatic achievements, such as the recent 
visit of the Thai Princess and the Bangladeshi Prime 
Minister, help mitigate international pressure for reform. 
 
3. (C)  Pinheiro said he was seeking current information on 
conditions in Burma for his presentation to the UN Human 
Rights Committee on March 31.  In addition to obtaining the 
views of the gathered Ambassadors, he said he would be 
meeting with SPDC Secretary One Khin Nyunt, the Home 
Minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, Aung San Suu 
Kyi, ethnic leaders, and \"all the usual suspects.\"  He also 
planned to visit Insein prison, a labor camp, and the tomb of 
U Thant (the only Burmese UN Secretary General).  Pinheiro 
said the short length of this visit did not allow any field 
visits.  He would be staying in Rangoon, but on his next 
visit he hoped to travel to Rakhine State. 
 
Proposed Human Rights Assessment Team 
 
4. (C)  Pinheiro said he would also seek SPDC approval of his 
proposal for a human rights assessment team to visit Burma, 
hopefully later this year.  Following up on the need for an 
independent assessment of the Shan rape allegations, Pinheiro 
said he has been back and forth a great deal with the Burmese 
on a mutually acceptable assessment.  He is now proposing a 
five-person team to conduct a 3-5 week assessment looking at 
human rights issues including rape, child soldiers, and the 
treatment of civilians in areas of conflict.  He does not 
know how the regime will react to this latest proposal but 
said he does not plan to continue making proposals and 
counter-proposals.  If the regime refuses to accept this 
proposal or if they delay, he said, he would go ahead with an 
assessment and published report based on information he has 
gathered along the Thai border.  He assumes that this would 
upset the GOB, but asserted that they would have only 
themselves to blame for not being responsive to his proposals 
to assess conditions from inside Burma. 
 
5. (C)  Pinheiro told the Ambassadors that if his proposal 
for an assessment team is accepted, he hoped the 
international community would provide funding for it.  COM 
Martinez and others assured Pinheiro that funding for the 
assessment would not be a problem.  The Australian Ambassador 
said he had been encouraging SPDC officials to agree to the 
assessment and told them that his government would provide 
funding. 
 
Ambassadors\' Feedback 
 
6. (C)  COM Martinez urged Pinheiro to press the regime to be 
more transparent in actions it takes on human rights.  As an 
example, she cited the March 16 release of 45 prisoners, some 
of them political prisoners, which local diplomats learned 
about only from rumors and press reports from foreign 
sources.  Similarly, the SPDC announced the release of 115 
prisoners last November but never provided a list of names of 
those released.  She said that, as a result, there has never 
been a full accounting of who was actually released in spite 
of efforts by several Embassies and the local press to sort 
it out.  Pinheiro said he shared the COM\'s frustration, 
agreeing that the regime does not provide information in an 
open or transparent manner even when it appears to be in its 
best interests to do so.  For example, the SPDC told him that 
the 45 prisoners released on March 16 included 15 elderly 
people, 15 women, and 15 political prisoners, but did not 
provide him with a list of names.  Now, he has learned that 
there may have only been a handful of political prisoners in 
the group.  (Note:  The NLD says only three of its members 
were released.  We have no information on other political 
prisoners among those released.  End Note.)  He added that 
whether it was a handful or fifteen, the regime\'s failure to 
release any political prisoners since his last visit was 
inexcusable and he intends to push hard for the unconditional 
release of all political prisoners. 
 
7. (C)  The COM also urged Pinheiro to emphasize to the SPDC 
the need to show their commitment to improving the human 
rights situation by committing fiscal resources to the 
process.  Setting up committees and organizations to mount 
public information campaigns was pointless if there were no 
fiscal resources to carry out investigations or assist 
victims, and the SPDC needs to know that the international 
community is not fooled by these tactics. 
 
8. (C)  The British Ambassador thanked Pinheiro for his 
December report, noting that with the way small segments of 
his report were misrepresented by regime-backed press he may 
want to be more careful of his wording in this report. 
Pinheiro said he believed his December report was accurate 
and that the executive summary, in particular, was a 
\"devastating\" criticism of the regime\'s failures.  He said he 
could not be responsible for how various periodicals \"spun\" 
his statements.  The British Ambassador added that if he 
comments again on the need for greater humanitarian 
assistance by the West, he should balance this with some 
information on the constraints and harassment that NGOs face 
in Burma, SPDC efforts to block assistance, and the need for 
humanitarian assistance to focus on progress on human rights. 
 Pinheiro said he agreed on all points and, specifically, he 
planned to include more on the constraints on NGOs in this 
report. 
 
9. (C)  The Japanese Ambassador stated that there is no 
question as to whether the SPDC is right or wrong; they are 
clearly wrong.  The key question now is how to persuade them 
to make improvements.  He argued against continued sanctions 
and tough rhetoric and encouraged engagement as a means to 
effective positive change.  The Australian Ambassador noted 
that engagement has been the policy of his country for more 
than one year and, so far at least, it has been a one-way 
street.  He cautioned that it has to be a two-way street for 
any progress to occur; the regime has to be willing to 
change. 
 
10. (C)  The French argued for continued sanctions and 
claimed that the regime does respond to this kind of 
pressure.  The German Ambassador drew the conversation back 
to practical measures for improving human rights in Burma, 
recommending that Pinheiro work with his UN colleagues to 
make human rights reporting part of every UN officer\'s 
responsibilities.  The Australian Ambassador recommended that 
Pinheiro\'s report should be a little harsher than the last on 
forced labor and child soldiers, both of which he believes to 
be widespread problems, and more balanced in its discussion 
of religious freedom.  The Ambassador said that while 
religious activities are restricted, most religious leaders 
have found ways around the restrictions and are quite active. 
 Pinheiro thanked the Ambassadors for their views and 
promised an outbrief on the results of his visit on March 26. 
Privately - \"Very Frustrated\" 
 
11. (C)  In a private meeting following the briefing, 
Pinheiro confided in COM Martinez that he is very frustrated 
with the regime\'s lack of progress on human rights.  Pinheiro 
said he has tried to provide openings for the regime to 
demonstrate some improvements on human rights but they 
continue to deny basic freedoms across the board.  He is 
questioning whether there is really an interest in the higher 
echelons of the regime for any improvement in human rights. 
He is not particularly hopeful that the SPDC will accept his 
proposal for a human rights assessment team.  If they do not, 
and he publishes a report based on information gathered along 
the Thai border, he anticipates that his relations with the 
regime will deteriorate.  He would prefer to maintain an open 
dialogue, he said, but without any positive action by the 
regime he must report what he finds.

SUBJECT: PINHEIRO SUSPENDS MISSION TO PROTEST GOVERNMENT 
EAVESDROPPING 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Pinheiro suspended his fifth mission to Burma 
on March 24 to protest a government eavesdropping incident at 
a supposedly confidential interview he conducted.  He will 
not return until he receives an explanation of the incident 
and a renewed government commitment to the guidelines for his 
missions.  On a more positive note, Pinheiro also reached 
agreement in principle on a UNHCR mission to Shan and Karen 
States to assess allegations of GOB violence against ethnic 
communities and the issue s of child soldiers and forced 
relocations.  Provided the detailed modalities for the 
mission can be worked out, and the GOB is able to meet 
Pinheiro\'s demands in regard to the eavesdropping incident, 
then he will return in May to complete his current mission 
and start the UNHCR assessment. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights Paulo Pinheiro 
had good and bad news for assembled diplomats on March 24. 
The bad news was that he will suspend his fifth mission to 
Burma two days early to protest government eavesdropping at a 
supposedly confidential interview in Insein prison on March 
22.  The good news is that he has reached agreement in 
principle with the GOB on a UNHCR mission to assessment 
allegations of rape and other government violence against 
ethnic minorities in Shan and Karen States, including the use 
of child soldiers and forced relocations. 
 
Eavesdropping Incident 
 
3. (C) The eavesdropping incident took place in a meeting 
room at Insein Prison on March 22.  According to Pinheiro, 
about one hour into a supposedly confidential interview he 
found a \"wireless microphone\" working below the table. 
Terming the instrument \"amateurish,\" and \"an example of 1940s 
technology,\" Pinheiro said that he found it hard to believe 
that any member of the SPDC\'s senior leadership had 
authorized the eavesdropping.  Nevertheless, the guidelines 
for his mission, including the complete confidentiality which 
is to be accorded all sources, is clear.  Consequently, he 
had no choice but to suspend his mission on the spot. 
Pinheiro added that he will not return until there is an 
acceptable explanation of the incident by the government, and 
a re-commitment by the government to all the guidelines for 
his mission. 
 
Assessment in Shan State 
 
4. (C) On a more positive note, Pinheiro said that he reached 
agreement in principle with Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt on March 
21 regarding a UNHCR assessment of the allegations of rape 
and other government violence against ethnic minorities in 
Shan and Karen States.  The exact modalities for the UNHCR 
assessment have to be worked out in negotiations with the 
SPDC\'s Brigadier General Than Tun and Deputy Foreign Minister 
Khin Maung Win.  However, Pinheiro indicated that mission\'s 
mandate would include allegations of forced relocations and 
the use of child soldiers, as well as allegations of rape. 
 
Political Prisoners 
 
5. (C) Pinheiro indicated that he did not make much progress 
in regard to political prisoners.  In fact, there appeared to 
have been some stiffening in the government position.  The 
government had provided the names and other identifying 
information on the 115 prisoners released last November, as 
well as the 48 released this year.  However, it continued to 
draw a distinction between prisoners who were members of 
political parties, and all other security detainees.  The GOB 
believes that only the former are political prisoners, while 
Pinheiro and the ICRC have been firm in asserting that all 
1,200 to 1,400 security detainees are political prisoners and 
should be released immediately.  The GOB was also cautious 
about commitments to new releases.  While they indicated that 
they would continue to release aged or sick prisoners on 
humanitarian grounds, they made no commitment about a general 
release of political prisoners. 
 
Political Dialogue 
 
6. (C) Finally, Pinheiro noted that the political dialogue 
between the National League for Democracy and the SPDC had 
fallen victim to mutual suspicions.  Each side accused the 
other of being insincere, almost in the same exact words, 
according to Pinheiro.  The SPDC in particular complained 
that the NLD had not responded to their gestures in releasing 
Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, allowing NLD 
offices to re-open and allowing senior NLD leaders to travel 
freely throughout Burma.  The NLD meanwhile continued to 
assert that there was no \"real dialogue.\"  (Note:  Pinheiro 
told COM privately after the meeting that the GOB\'s claim 
that Brigadier General Than Tun has meet with ASSK ten times 
since the Special Rapporteur\'s visit in November was 
confirmed by ASSK.  However, ASSK said that the meetings had 
not resulted in any substantive dialogue. End Note.) 
 
7. (C) Pinheiro was also mildly sarcastic regarding Aung San 
Suu Kyi and the other NLD leaders.  They wasted, he said, one 
hour of his three-hour meeting with them on a pointless 
semantic debate regarding \"principled engagement,\" a term he 
had used in his report.  He defended the concept, and said he 
would proceed as he described in the report, but nevertheless 
agreed to drop the use of the term, since the NLD found it 
offensive. 
 
Next Steps 
 
8. (C) According to Pinheiro, the ball is now in the SPDC\'s 
court.  It has \"to demonstrate that it wants to continue\" 
with the Special Rapporteur\'s visits.  That will require an 
explanation of the eavesdropping incident and guarantees 
against any further incidents like it.  In addition, Pinheiro 
said, it will be necessary to have agreement in detail very 
soon on the modalities for a UNHCR mission to Shan and Karen 
States (along with donor funding for the mission).  If those 
conditions could be met, Pinheiro said, he would definitely 
consider returning in May.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason 1.5 (d). 
 
 1. (C) Summary: Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia\'s 
three day visit to Burma produced understandings on trade, 
transport connections, and refugees.  Terrorism was not 
discussed, but, according to the Bangladeshi Defense Attache, 
Bangladesh has continued with efforts to clean up its side of 
the border. End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) The visit of Bangladesh\'s Prime Minister Khaleda Zia 
went very well, according to Bangladesh\'s Defense Attache, 
Brigadier Salim Akhtar.  The visit was meant to reciprocate 
Than Shwe\'s December 2002 visit to Bangladesh and underline 
Bangladesh\'s new interest in relations with Burma and the 
other states of Southeast Asia.  Begum Zia met with Than Shwe 
for about 90 minutes on March 20 and agreed on a number of 
key points, including: 
 
-- A Road Connection between Dhaka and Rangoon:  According to 
Brigadier Salim this will involve construction of a small 
bridge upstream on the Naaf River and a short stretch of road 
in Burma\'s Rakhine State.  If all goes well, construction on 
the bridge and road will start this year. 
 
-- Coastal Shipping: An MOU signed on March 20 will allow 
direct service between Chittagong and Rangoon.  Until now, 
cargoes between the two states were shipped via Singapore, 
 
-- Trade: A second MOU established a joint trade commission 
and a bilateral trading account.  Both arrangements are 
intended to facilitate trade. 
 
-- Refugees: Essentially, the two sides agreed to let the 
Rohingya Muslim refugee issue die.  Burma recommitted itself 
to accepting back all refugees who could establish their 
credentials as genuine residents of Burma; Bangladesh made no 
commitments, but implicitly agreed to accomodate any refugees 
who could not or would not return to Burma. 
 
Burmese Business Community Bullish on Bangladesh 
 
3. (C) According to members of the Union of Myanmar Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry (UMCCI), the trade fair that 
accompanied PM Zia\'s visit may lead to better ties.  Burma\'s 
exports to Bangladesh now largely consist of smuggled goods 
(mostly rice) or transhipped consumer products from China. 
While the business leaders don\'t believe improved trade ties 
will end smuggling, they do hope for some increase in legal 
trade (e.g.; agricultural and wood products from Burma in 
return for pharmaceuticals and cement from Bangladesh). 
 
False Rumors 
 
4. (C) According to Salim, the two sides did not discuss any 
plans for energy cooperation.  U.S. companies in Bangladesh 
(meaning UNOCAL) had attempted to promote a pipeline from a 
prospective gas field off Burma\'s Rakhine State to Bangladesh 
and then onwards to India, but there has been no official 
backing for the proposal from either Burma or Bangldesh. 
Similarly, according to Salim and the UMCCI representatives, 
news stories of Burmese plans to lease rice cultivation land 
to Bangladeshi entrepreneurs appeared to reflect only the 
musings of Bangladeshi private sector interests.  There had 
been no discussion at all of that possibility during the 
official talks. 
 
Terrorism 
 
5. (C) Salim also said that the two sides did not get into 
any serious discussion of terrorism along their common 
border.  However, he said that the Burmese were aware of 
Bangladeshi efforts to clean up the area.  Salim said that 
the Bangladeshi Army had run sweeps through the area in June 
2002, December 2002, and February 2003.  The target was 
gun-running by the Rohingya Solidarity Organization (RSO), 
which he said was funneling arms from Thailand to criminal 
gangs in Bangladesh.  Salim noted that the RSO had only 150 
to 200 men under arms and were more a nuisance than a serious 
threat to anyone.  Nevertheless, the BDG was determined to 
deal with the problem and to bring it to an end by June 2003, 
if possible. 
Strategy 
 
6. (C) Salim said that this new openness in relations with 
Burma was part of Bangladesh\'s own \"Look Eastward\" policy. 
Just as India had reopened relations with Burma out of an 
early 1990s fear of encirclement by China and its allies, so 
Bangladesh has taken the same step out of a similar fear of 
encirclement by India and its allies.  According to Salim, 
there was also the lure of trade with Southeast Asia.  For 
too long, he said, Bangladesh had focussed its foreign policy 
on India, China, and the West, without ever considering the 
opportunities in Southeast Asia.  This visit, together with 
the exchange of visits between Begum Zia and Thailand\'s Prime 
Minister Thaksin in December 2002, were steps towards a 
broader and more balanced set of relations for Bangladesh. 
Comment 
 
7. (C) Bangladesh is the latest of the regional states to 
discover Burma.  Like China, India, and Thailand before it, 
Bangladesh has evidently come to the conclusion that there is 
more to be gained from dealing with Burma than from shunning 
it.  From the Burmese side, there\'s no arguing that the SPDC, 
increasingly isolated politically by the West, is having 
signficant diplomatic success in improving its economic and 
political relations with neighbors and ASEAN partners.  The 
visit of Prime Minister Zia, on the heels of a trip by Senior 
General Than Shwe to Vietnam, demonstrates that this 
diplomatic campaign, at first focused on the major players 
(India, China, and Thailand), is now expanding to countries 
with which Burma has not had historically strong ties.  End

1. (SBU) Summary:  Armed Forces Day, March 27, saw the 
military government mount its traditional large military 
parade and host a state banquet in the posh Armed Forces 
grand hall and theater.  The pro-democracy parties celebrated 
Anti-Fascist Resistance Day (commemorating the 1945 switch of 
General Aung San\'s Burmese army from the Japanese to the 
Allied camps) with a well-attended gathering in the hall of 
the decrepit NLD national headquarters building.  The 
eventful day included two bombs (see reftels), which killed 
two and injured five.  The devices may have been planted by a 
radical student group frustrated with the lack of progress on 
the return to democracy.  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
Armed Forces Day 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U) Undeterred by the early morning discovery of a IED in 
a park in central Rangoon, the Burmese military held its 
customary military parade of some 8,000 well-drilled troops. 
Senior General Than Shwe made short remarks to the assembled 
group that included foreign military attaches. 
 
3.  (U) In the evening Than Shwe hosted a black tie gala 
affair for about 400 people, including top military officers, 
government officials, and representatives of the diplomatic 
corps and international organizations.  The dinner and 
cultural show was held in the spacious Armed Forces grand 
hall and theater complex in northern Rangoon. 
 
4.  (C) Senior General Than Shwe looked happy and fit.  One 
of his favorites, General Shwe Mann, once again stood in for 
ailing Vice Senior General Maung Aye.  During the socializing 
period prior to dinner the top four senior generals stood 
apart from the crowd while most invitees were busy exchanging 
greetings with various contacts and friends.  Oddly, almost 
no one approached the four top generals.  After an 
embarrassingly long spell, the ambassador from Singapore went 
up and spoke briefly to General Khin Nyunt. 
 
5.  (C) After dinner the guests were treated to a cultural 
show performed by the Ministry of Culture troupe.  The 
evening culminated with a musical drama entitled \"Brilliant 
Endeavors of King Bayinnaung,\" introduced by the MC as 
 
\"reflections on this beloved king, who, utilizing all his 
physical and mental prowess to advance the well-being of his 
people, with the army\'s help, constructed many roads and 
bridges to tie the land together.  He also propagated the 
Buddhist faith with many generous contributions to temples, 
monasteries, and pagodas.\" 
 
(NOTE: probably ninety percent of Than Shwe\'s public 
appearances consist of inspecting roads and bridges or making 
donations to Buddhist groups, leaving little doubt about the 
real-life hero of the evening\'s musical drama.) 
 
 
--------------------------- 
Anti-Fascist Resistance Day 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) About 400 supporters of pro-democracy parties crammed 
together in the run-down headquarters of the NLD, with scores 
of people outside listening to the presentations on 
loudspeakers.  There was no visible security force presence 
and the participants were not hindered in any way.  Diplomats 
representing the U.S., Britain, Australia, Japan, France, 
Italy, and Korea attended, as did reps from UNDP, UNICEF, and 
UNODC. 
 
7.  (U) Speaking forcefully in Burmese, Aung San Suu Kyi 
recalled her father\'s aims in leading Burma\'s drive toward 
independence.  She also echoed JFK\'s \"ask not\" speech when 
she said: 
 
There are some people who ask, \"when will we achieve 
democracy?\"  Instead of asking such a question, ask yourself 
whether you are doing your duty and contributing towards it. 
We need to overcome such difficulties as we did during the 
revolutionary period against fascists.  We will surely 
succeed! 
 
8.  (U) After her short extemporaneous speech, ASSK sat on 
the floor on a woven mat alongside NLD party representatives 
from around the country and listened in the stifling heat to 
the other speakers.  Monks, student groups, and at least 6 
other political parties were represented at the event. 
Former Defense Minister U Tin Oo, the NLD\'s Vice Chairman, 
gave the lengthy keynote address, calling for national unity 
and a strong military with a dignified position within a 
democratic Union.  Afterwards ASSK came over and warmly 
thanked the Charge\' for attending. 
 
9.  (C)  The NLD\'s geriatric Central Executive Committee, 
seated in a row of chairs behind the podium, resembled the 
front porch, one might imagine, of Rangoon\'s Home for the 
Aged and Infirm. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C) The events of the day, punctuated by the lethal 
mid-day bomb blast, illuminated many differences between the 
ruling State Peace and Development Committee and the 
pro-democracy parties in style, aims, power, and wealth.  The 
democratic parties, absent progress on substantive dialogue 
leading to political transition, run the risk of becoming 
irrelevant in the eyes of those who impatiently chafe at the 
regime\'s repressive rule.  The terrorist bombs of March 27 
reinforce the view of some people of the need for continued 
strong military rule, while for others they highlight ongoing 
resistance to such rule.  The challenge ahead for Aung San 
Suu Kyi and the NLD is to effect visible signs of peaceful 
progress in the face of determined intransigence on the part 
of the ruling SPDC and the violent provocations from a small 
number of anti-regime radicals.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATOR RECEIVES SANCTUARY INSIDE 
BRITISH EMBASSY 
 
 
Classified By:  COM CARMEN MARTINEZ. REASON: 1.5 (D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  A young man involved in a sidewalk 
pro-democracy demonstration April 4 dashed into the British 
embassy to avoid arrest and as of April 7, remains inside. 
His co-demonstrator, a monk from Bago, is in regime hands. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) British embassy sources tell us that on Friday, April 
4, a monk held up a pro-democracy placard while another young 
man unfurled a pro-democracy flag on the sidewalk in front of 
the British embassy in Rangoon.  Within ten seconds the monk 
was grabbed by police and hustled off into custody.  The 
other young man bolted into the embassy\'s lobby.  The 
demonstrator is still inside as of April 7, being housed in a 
consular section interview room.  The demonstrator does not 
want to go outside, fearing (with some justification) that he 
is likely to be arrested and sentenced to seven years in 
prison.  The British embassy has been providing temporary 
sanctuary, has been in close contact with London, and has 
discussed the issue with Burmese officials. 
 
3. (C) Our British contacts emphasize that the young 
demonstrator inside the embassy is not affiliated with the 
NLD.  He is an ethnic Burman, is not a student, and does not 
appear to be highly educated.  His flag sported a circle 
around a fighting peacock on a red field, a general symbol of 
student resistance.  It was attached to the flagstaff upside 
down, we noted.  The young man told the British that the 
monk, whom he assumes is being interviewed by the police, 
does not know his true name.  The monk, reportedly from the 
city of Bago, also uses a pseudonym. 
 
4. (C) The British embassy staff did not indicate what they 
intend to do with their young guest.  Burmese MFA says this 
is the first such incident in fifteen years, and tells the 
British that they would be lenient with the young man (a 
claim the British aren\'t buying).  Post will review our 
policy on humanitarian sanctuary and walk-ins with the local 
guard force, MSG detachment, and other embassy staff.

REF: RANGOON 365 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Another payday passed without incident on 
March 31, but that does not mean that all is well in Burma. 
The banking crisis continues grimly on, with increasing 
negative spillover into the general economy.  Though bankers, 
borrowers, and businesses are begging for mercy, government 
policies have thus far only exacerbated the pain.  The GOB\'s 
objective is uncertain; it may simply want to clear out some 
bad banking operations.  Alternatively, it may be aiming for 
some more general government takeover of the private banking 
sector.  End summary. 
 
All Quiet on the Industrial Front 
 
2. (C)  Another payday came and went on March 31 without 
disturbance.  Industrialists and bankers with whom we spoke 
said that for the most part workers were paid at least part 
of their salary through a patchwork of short term measures. 
Those with a steady income (such as garment exporters) had no 
problem, others continued selling off dollars or other assets 
(at depressed prices) and/or borrowing privately from 
cash-rich firms to make ends meet.  In other cases factory 
owners had to beg forbearance from workers, extending only 
25-50 percent of employee salaries.  Some bankers reportedly 
tried to open their coffers to large private corporate 
customers to help them meet their responsibilities, but were 
rejected by the GOB\'s banking \"oversight\" committee, the 
Private Bank Management Committee. 
 
3. (C) All were adamant, though, that another peaceful payday 
is no indication that the banking crisis is resolved or that 
the economy is back on track.  Private banks are still 
restricted by fiat from offering more than 100,000 kyat 
(about $110 at current rates) per week to each depositor.  As 
a result, kyats remain in short supply as businesses and 
others hoard whatever kyat they have pending a return of 
economic confidence and liquidity to the market.  Reflecting 
this, the kyat/dollar rate has settled at about 900, despite 
a brief uptick in dollar value in the week ending March 21st 
due to the government\'s biannual international gem auction. 
 
Bankers or Victims? 
 
4. (C) The regime\'s major policy thrust continues to be 
forcing borrowers to repay 40 percent of their outstanding 
loans by April 30.  In only the second GOB statement on the 
banking situation since it began, Secretary One, General Khin 
Nyunt, told the Union of Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry on March 29, \"in consideration of those who had 
deposited money in the banks, in the long-term interests of 
the banks, and to strengthen the national economy, those who 
have taken loans from the banks should try to repay the debts 
speedily.\"  Bankers report that they, with assistance from 
Military Intelligence, have been somewhat successful in 
getting borrowers to return money, but that not all companies 
are able to meet the requirement.  However, bankers assert, 
this approach is killing their customers.  It may help settle 
their obligations to depositors, but in the end, banks, 
businesses and individuals will all go under collectively. 
Corporate borrowers complain that the demand for loan 
repayment, the lack of new credit, and the general economic 
doldrums, have frozen their production and eroded profits. 
 
5. (C) On top of this, according to several bankers, some of 
the private banks are no longer accepting new deposits.  It 
is unclear whether this is due to a new directive from the 
Committee, or whether private banks are interpreting broadly 
a previous order to cease offering so-called \"special 
deposits\" (deposits whose total value the banks would 
guarantee).  Whatever the case, while loan repayments will 
keep up with demand for withdrawals for now, a cut-off of new 
deposits, combined with existing prohibitions on extending 
new credit, will slowly starve the banks to death. 
 
6. (C) Though the origin of this new policy is debatable, 
bankers and economists are predictably blaming the 
government.  They argue that the SPDC is intentionally 
softening up the largest private banks for future liquidation 
or merger with either a government bank (namely Myanmar 
Economic Bank) or one of the two military-run banks (Innwa 
Bank and Myawaddy Bank).  The rumor mill\'s money is on the 
relatively young and agile Innwa Bank (run by the Myanmar 
Economic Corporation (MEC)) as MEC\'s Chairman, Quartermaster 
General Lieutenant General Tin Aung Myint Oo, is now in 
charge of the Private Bank Management Committee.  Experts 
estimate that at current rates of repayment and withdrawals, 
private banks can last another one to six months before they 
go under. 
 
GOB\'s Rose-Tinted Glasses 
7. (C) Though the current economic problems are clear to 
economists, bankers, and businesspeople, the GOB sees it 
differently.  The new Minister of Finance (a general whose 
previous area of concern was ordnance production) recently 
told one highly placed source that the strengthening kyat, 
deflation of the asset bubbles, and the stabilization or 
decline of prices of many consumer goods prove that the GOB\'s 
response to the banking situation has been just what the 
doctor ordered.  Bankers tell us that this same \"tough love\" 
sentiment pervades nightly Private Bank Management Committee 
sessions. 
 
The Blame Game Continues 
 
8. (C) The government\'s position has always been that private 
bankers got themselves into this mess and can damn well get 
themselves back out by calling in the speculative investments 
and insider loans that seem to have characterized private 
banking in Burma.  In econspeak, one might say that the 
government is sensitive to the moral hazard that would emerge 
from too precipitous a bailout of some of the larger private 
banks.  Bankers themselves, of course, see things 
differently.  They point to the antecedent conditions under 
which they were obliged to operate, while implicitly asking 
whether there was any other way to make money in banking when 
deposit and lending rates were capped at levels 5000 basis 
points below inflation.  Both sides are of course right, just 
as both sides were originally wrong in their behavior.  Right 
now, however, sorting out who was right and who was wrong is 
not nearly as important as containing the crisis\' infection 
of the rest of the economy. 
 
9. (C) The fact is, however, that the government\'s approach 
has thus far only worsened the liquidity crunch.  While the 
regime\'s actions have produced some unintended benefits in 
reducing general inflation and popping the asset price 
bubbles that had grown up in recent years, it has also placed 
most businesses under extraordinary pressures.  So far, the 
government seems to believe that only a few of the largest 
private banks will go down, when all is said and done, and 
that state and military-owned banks will be able to pick up 
the slack.  However, there are no firewalls between the 
private banks and the government-run institutions.  Moreover, 
government-owned banks will almost certainly be far less 
inclined than their private sector competitors to seek out 
non-government borrowers, depositors, and business 
opportunities.  While the economy could undoubtedly do with a 
more restrained credit-generation machine, an expansion of 
the government banking sector will most certainly chill the 
overall economic environment, push more of the economy 
underground, and set back Burma\'s meager economic development. 
 
10. (C) In short, the government here is playing a high-risk 
game.  It may be right.  We haven\'t seen the loan books of 
any of these banks, and can\'t really say if the GOB is 
justified in coming down on them so hard.  However, we can be 
certain that if the regime is wrong, the entire Burmese 
economy will pay a heavy price for the SPDC\'s mistakes.

1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph seven. 
 
2. (C) Summary: The language of the recent FY 2003-04 omnibus 
spending measure\'s managers\' report (asking us to work with 
the NLD on a \"new initiative\" to outline a comprehensive 
needs assessment) seems at odds with subsequent guidance (Ref 
A) limiting this assessment only to democracy-related 
programming.  We ask that the Department revisit this issue 
with the Hill to see if there is support for a slightly less 
restrictive approach that would still address the primary 
concern that USG assistance does not in any way benefit the 
SPDC regime.  End summary. 
 
3. (C) We appreciate Ref A\'s elaboration on the language in 
the FY 2003-04 omnibus spending measure\'s managers\' report 
regarding working with the NLD to identify and address the 
\"urgent needs\" of the Burmese people.  We were surprised, 
though, by the expectation that traditional limitations on 
general ESF funding would apply to this \"new initiative.\" 
The managers\' report discusses other earmark-funded programs, 
namely for fighting HIV/AIDS, that are not limited to 
democracy promotion.  We welcomed what we thought was indeed 
a \"new initiative\" along these lines; to look -- as always in 
tandem with the NLD and its leadership -- with an unbiased, 
unjaded eye at what the most pressing priorities are. 
Consulting with the NLD on the best way for the USG to 
promote democracy in Burma does not constitute a \"new 
initiative.\"  This has been the backbone of our work here for 
many years. 
 
4. (C) The managers\' report asks us to use the \"expertise of 
the leadership\" of the NLD to determine and address the 
\"urgent needs of the people of Burma.\"  Nowhere does it imply 
that the intent of the managers was to limit these findings 
to new democracy programming.  Indeed, from elsewhere in the 
managers\' report (such as the section requesting a report 
from U.S. AID on the conditions of Burmese refugees and 
displaced persons) it is evident that Congress this year is 
interested in exploring the \"root causes\" of the crises 
facing the people of Burma.  This is a laudable objective. 
Though lack of freedom and deplorable human rights are a 
fundamental reason for the suffering of all Burmese people 
(displaced or not), the more immediate causes of the 
humanitarian crisis facing the Burmese people are horrendous 
health, sanitation, and educational deficiencies.  These are 
the issues that other bilateral donors are now addressing, in 
some cases quite independently of the SPDC. 
 
5. (C) Limiting before the fact any discussion to democracy 
promotion programs seems to go against the managers\' intent. 
It also ignores the NLD leadership\'s previously expressed 
ideas that \"urgent needs of the people of Burma\" go well 
beyond such programs.  The NLD leadership has welcomed U.S. 
support for HIV/AIDS, childhood development programs, 
environmental conservation, and protection of workers rights 
inside the country.  While none of these fits directly within 
the limited definition of democracy and governance programs, 
there\'s no question that all would reside on the list sought 
by Congress of \"urgent needs.\" 
 
6. (C) A third argument for allowing more slack in the reins 
is that by giving the NLD and its leadership more flexibility 
to guide USG assistance efforts, the party will gain status 
and credibility with the SPDC, hopefully convincing it of the 
NLD\'s important and indispensable role in the future of the 
country.  As reported in Ref B, at the most recent ICG 
meeting in Tokyo, U.N. Special Envoy Razali urged donors to 
work closely with the NLD while developing aid programs 
specifically as a way to build up ASSK and the NLD and 
perhaps get the dialogue jump started.  From the local angle, 
U.S. assistance to NLD-promoted humanitarian projects will 
help cement the role of the NLD as a party truly interested 
in and dedicated to the \"needs of the people.\" 
 
7. (C)  Action request:  We urge the Department to return to 
the Hill to revisit this matter with all/all authors of the 
report language, to decide whether it\'s truly in USG 
interests to put the democracy promotion limitation on the 
consultative process before we\'ve heard what the NLD has to 
say.  We propose instead to approach the NLD and its 
leadership with the broader aim of identifying programs that 
address the urgent needs of the people (as requested by the 
report language) and also scrupulously avoid \"providing 
direct support to the SPDC\" and its affiliated organizations.

SUBJECT: REGIME EASES UP ON ASSK HARASSMENT 
 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary: NLD spokesman U Lwin told Poloff on April 
7 that ASSK and party were harassed by SPDC and local 
authorities representatives for the first few days of their 
visit to Chin State.  However, Military Intelligence (MI) 
officials, who provided earlier assurances that there would 
be no such harassment, have apparently stepped in to prevent 
further incidents.  The sequence of events indicates that the 
SPDC is still working out how best to manage relations with 
the NLD within Senior General Than Shwe\'s overarching 
hard-line policy.  End Summary. 
2. (SBU)  In spite of the authorities, efforts to prevent 
people from turning out for ASSK as she traveled through 
Magwe Division to Chin State, NLD spokesman U Lwin told 
Poloff that large crowds chose to risk official threats of 
\"serious consequences\" to greet her.  He cited as an example, 
a town in Chin State in which the community turned out in a 
silent candle vigil along the roadside to welcome ASSK and 
her party as they arrived late at night.  According to U 
Lwin, harassment during the first four days of the visit 
included the following: 
 
-- local authorities played loud recordings of Buddhist 
prayers and sermons denouncing ASSK as an enemy and stating 
that she was unwelcome; 
 
-- the Minister of Information and Deputy Ministers of Home 
Affairs, Religious Affairs, and Mines visited the area just 
ahead of ASSK telling their local employees and other 
residents along her route to stay home during her visit. 
They threatened serious actions against any employees and 
their families who showed support for the NLD, noting that 
videotapes would be taken to identify those who turned out to 
see ASSK; 
 
-- the Deputy Minister for Mines told his Ministry\'s 
employees that there would be no dialogue with the NLD or 
transfer of power (Note: This echoes similar remarks 
attributed to Secretary Two Lt. General Soe Win at a USDA 
gathering in Pyay about two months ago.  End Note); 
 
--  local authorities believed to be USDA members used 
abusive language to disburse crowds gathering to meet ASSK 
and threatened actions against locals painting signs wishing 
ASSK good health. 
 
3. (SBU)    U Lwin said he reported these abuses as he 
learned of them to the NLD\'s MI liaison, Brigadier General 
Than Tun, who had earlier provided assurances to U Lwin and 
ASSK personally that there would be no such harassment on 
this trip.  U Lwin told Poloff that Than Tun appeared 
genuinely surprised that the harassment was occurring, and 
that it was being directed by SPDC Ministers and Deputy 
Ministers.  A turning point apparently came on April 6, 
according to U Lwin, when election committee authorities 
(under the Ministry of Home Affairs) in Haka, the capitol of 
Chin State, refused to allow ASSK to open the NLD office 
there.  Prior to the trip, MI had agreed to allow ASSK to 
open six NLD offices during her trip, including the office in 
Haka.  U Lwin said he reported the incident to MI at noon and 
within 15 minutes, the NLD party in Haka called to tell him 
they had received word that they could open the office. 
Since that time, U Lwin told Poloff, the harassment of ASSK 
and her party appears to have ended, and she opened another 
township office early on April 7 without incident. 
 
4. (C)  Comment: Although ASSK will be traveling for 
approximately five more days and more harassment could occur, 
U Lwin appeared hopeful that MI has now stepped in to ensure 
the rest of the trip goes smoothly.  The SPDC\'s handling of 
the trip highlights continuing internal differences on how 
best to handle relations with the NLD.  The dispatching of 
the Minister of Information and several Deputy Ministers to 
the area to whip up public sentiment against ASSK and 
threaten those interested in turning out to see her is 
consistent with the hard-line that Senior General Than Shwe 
appears to have laid down on no dialogue or power sharing 
with ASSK.  These actions indicate little interest in 
pursuing the non-confrontational relations between the SPDC 
and NLD that Special Envoy Razali has tried to nurture since 
late 2000.  However, MI appears to be pursuing a less harsh 
approach, perhaps hoping to avoid negative international 
press such as that received after the harassment of ASSK on 
her Rakhine trip late last year.  While MI must conform to 
the Senior General\'s overall hard-line stance, its efforts to 
coordinate ASSK\'s travel, even if only to avoid bad press, 
provide her the opportunity to continue to rebuild the party 
structure and patiently but consistently push for democratic 
reform. End Comment.

SUBJECT: FUNDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR OPPOSITION 
YOUTH 
 
 
1.  Summary:  In three separate meetings in recent months, 
democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) has raised the issue 
of providing educational opportunity to opposition youth who 
are denied the right to attend Burmese universities and 
denied passports to travel abroad for study.  She has 
appealed for some way to provide \"correspondence courses\" so 
that these youth can continue to work toward a degree at a 
recognized institution of higher learning.  Post endorses 
this idea as being worthy of support and suggests Department 
investigate a grant arrangement with a university or 
education NGO to administer a correspondence program. 
 
2.  Apparently fearful of the political power of an organized 
student body, which manifested itself in political uprisings 
in 1988, 1990, 1994, and 1996, the military regime has 
succeeded in effectively destroying Burma\'s university 
system.  Universities were closed for six out of the last ten 
years.  Campuses were relocated to distant suburbs so 
students would have less time to congregate together.  Now 
\"distance learning,\" the Ministry of Education\'s latest 
affront to education, allows students to attend classes two 
weeks a semester after months of \"self study.\"  At the same 
time the regime degraded the university system, they built up 
a system of degree institutions for the military, to which 
their own children are ensured entrance. 
 
3.  However, there is no place in either side of the two tier 
system for political dissidents.  Younger political prisoners 
arrested in 1996 and recently released on the occasion of a 
visit from a UN envoy have learned that they may not return 
to their studies to complete their university degree. 
(Several of them have been admitted to English classes at the 
American Center free of charge to give them some possibility 
for self-improvement.)  Children of dissidents are also 
denied places at university as punishment for their parents\' 
misdeeds.  Former political prisoners are also denied 
passports.  They may not go abroad even if they had the 
economic wherewithal to afford overseas study. (Oppression by 
the regime ensures they do not.) 
 
4.  ASSK has asked us, if students may not go to the 
university, to find a way to bring the university to them. 
Post suggests the department investigate a grant to a 
university or educational NGO to administer a program of 
correspondence (not/not internet-based distance learning) 
courses leading to an undergraduate degree at an accredited 
institution for opposition-affiliated youth who are denied 
other educational opportunities. 
 
5.  Post Public Affairs Section could assist the grant 
program in the following ways: 
-- assist program (or university) administrator with 
identifying candidate students; 
-- offer students use of the American Center Library and 
reference service; 
-- offer students limited use of personal computers to 
complete assignments; 
-- offer occasional writing labs and discussion sessions for 
student participants; 
-- facilitate mailing of course material and assignments via 
diplomatic pouch. 
 
6.  Post estimates that the program may require a full-time 
administrator at first, possibly dropping to half-time after 
the program is established.  If not resident in Rangoon, the 
administrator would probably need to travel to Rangoon for 
extended periods.  Post estimates that perhaps five qualified 
candidates could be found for the first semester, and 
possibly more.  They should be fully funded for at least a 
half-time courseload.  If it were possible to also fund a 
small stipend, students could dispense with working and might 
be able to handle a full courseload.  Even $100 a month could 
pay all living expenses.  It would be desireable to secure 
out-year funding, if possible, so that the course of study 
would not be interrupted. 
 
7.  ASSK has also appealed to the British Embassy, which has 
expressed interest in collaborating with Embassy Rangoon, in 
the same way we have collaborated on other training programs. 
 They are seeking funding to sponsor two students.  Their 
political officer suggested that the Open University in 
London might be able to tailor a course of study for the 
Burmese students.  Post would be open to any solution that 
satisfied the need for higher education, whether it involves 
a U.S. institution or an English one.

1. (C) Summary: Minutes from a short meeting between the 
Japanese Ambassador and the Burmese Minister of National 
Planning and Economic Development emphasize the new 
pro-engagement policy outlined by the Japanese at the recent 
ICG meeting in Tokyo.  The Ambassador\'s remarks give some 
insight into Japan\'s vision of its policy in Burma, both 
bilateral and as part of the larger Japan-ASEAN relationship. 
 End summary. 
 
Japan Stresses its Independence 
 
2. (C) In a meeting on February 21, the Japanese Ambassador 
to Burma reiterated to the Minister of Economic Development 
and National Planning, U Soe Tha, Japan\'s determination to 
push ahead with a more ambitious policy of engagement with 
Burma.  According to classified GOB minutes of this meeting, 
the Japanese Ambassador also gave the Minister a short 
readout of the Tokyo Informal Consultative Group (ICG) 
meeting that took place on February 15 (described in Ref A). 
 
3. (C) The minutes record that the Ambassador reported the 
ICG\'s conclusion that the United States, the United Kingdom, 
and \"western groups\" have not been succesful in trying to 
pressure Burma.  Instead, the international community should 
try a new \"way\" of extending more assistance to Burma.  In 
that spirit, the Ambassador told the Minister Japan will 
provide more humanitarian assistance and advice on economic 
reform and political development.  He added that Japan will 
begin to take action regardless of what other nations decide 
to do.  The Ambassador stressed that other countries and 
international organizations are seeking their own ways to 
start assisting Burma.  However, even if the international 
community does not join in, Japan will carry out its 
intentions -- even if the Japanese government has to 
\"confront challenges\" to do so. 
 
4. (C) The Japanese Ambassador, according to the minutes, 
went on to say that Japan must consider its relations with 
Burma in the larger context of Japan-ASEAN ties, and 
strengthening the influence of ASEAN.  Somewhat more 
cryptically, the minutes record the Japanese Ambassador 
urging the Minister to ponder seriously the importance of 
Burma\'s relations with India and the PRC. 
 
5. (C) The Minister replied to the Ambassador quite 
positively, complimenting him for his understanding of the 
\"true situation\" in the country.  He urged the Ambassador to 
work hard to ensure the Japanese government would soon carry 
out the policy that had been outlined. 
 
Ties that Bind? 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador\'s approach to the Minister dovetails 
very well with the strong new position of engagement laid out 
by the Japanese delegation at the ICG.  The only disconnect 
between the two was the mention of using greater engagement 
to encourage political dialogue; a theme Japan supported at 
the ICG, but which the Ambassador apparently failed to 
mention during his meeting with U Soe Tha.  The Ambassador\'s 
assertion that Japan will act independently of other parties, 
and his remarks on the importance of Japan\'s ties with ASEAN, 
and thus Burma, might be interpreted as a reminder by the 
Ambassador of Japan\'s importance as a regional power -- 
competing as it is with the aggressive diplomacy in Burma of 
China and India.

Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1.(C) Summary: Reliable sources indicate that Razali\'s next 
visit could be delayed until late summer and, as the Special 
Envoy\'s tenth trip to Rangoon slips, so does his ability to 
rescue the political dialogue. On his next visit, Razali must 
have substantial meetings with the Senior General; he should 
deliver a formal written message from SYG Annan expressing 
disappointment with the stalemate in the political dialogue, 
urging the immediate and unconditional release of all 
political prisoners, and urging the implementation of 
effective economic reform efforts; and he  must insist on 
meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi. There is no guarantee that any 
of these actions will push the SPDC down the path to 
meaningful political dialogue with the opposition.  But they 
can make it clear to the regime that the \"comfort zone\" they 
have established in the region does not extend to the larger 
international community.  The regime must understand that a 
visible commitment to political dialogue and economic reform 
is the only way to mitigate international condemnation and 
address the country\'s continuing decline.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The latest word from reliable sources indicates that 
Razali\'s next visit will not take place before the very end 
of April or early May, and could be delayed until late 
summer.  As the Special Envoy\'s tenth trip to Rangoon slips, 
so does his ability to rescue the political dialogue from a 
quagmire of distrust and broken promises.  Although Razali 
received unanimous public statements of support at the 
February ICG meeting in Tokyo (Ref A, para 5) for continuing 
his mission, he had little to offer the group in the way of 
new strategies to move the regime (and particularly Burma\'s 
supreme ruler, Senior General Than Shwe) closer to a real 
political dialogue with the opposition.  In addition, since 
Razali\'s \"face\" with the generals is predicated on his 
relationship with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir, he will 
inevitably lose some of that face as the time draws near for 
Mahatir to step down from office in October.  Signs of 
Razali\'s waning prestige with the generals include the 
insulting few minutes he was given with Than Shwe on his 
November 2002 visit, and the regime\'s success in pressuring 
him to cancel a visit to Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 
3. (C) Razali has been described by those in recent contact 
with him as variously pessimistic, frustrated, or jaded.  He 
definitely appears to be out of fresh ideas.  In a side 
meeting with the COM and EAP/DAS Daley the morning after the 
Tokyo ICG, Razali floated the idea of having SYG Annan write 
a letter to Than Shwe regarding the need for political and 
economic reform but then asked somewhat helplessly \"But then 
who could deliver it to Than Shwe?\"  Given that the obvious 
person to deliver such a letter would be Razali himself, his 
question reinforced a sense of frustration (and perhaps his 
naivet), just as when he told the assembled diplomatic corps 
in November that he had just come to the realization that the 
agreements with anyone in the regime, including Secretary One 
Khin Nyunt, meant nothing without the final word by Than Shwe 
(see Ref B, para 2). 
 
4. (C) It was apparent at the Tokyo ICG that Razali hopes to 
use Rangoon UNDP\'s upcoming report on the results of its 
\"Humanitarian Review Exercise\" (scheduled for summer release 
to the GOB, civil society groups, the NLD and other political 
parties for the consultative process before being finalized) 
as a tool to break the political stalemate (Ref C, para 6). 
This confirms recent information received from Razali\'s 
assistant (see Ref D, para 5), but raises the concern that 
the humanitarian issues could be lost in acrimony between the 
NLD and the SPDC. Ralzali promoted the idea of strengthening 
the NLD by including them in development of new humanitarian 
aid programs and he should press the regime to allow 
participation by the NLD and civil society organizations in 
addressing the dire humanitarian needs of the Burmese people. 
What Razali should not do is insist on making dialogue 
between Aung San Suu Kyi and the Senior General/ Secretary 
One an absolute condition for implementing the 
recommendations that will arise from the UNDP assessment. 
 
5. (C) We have also heard that Razali has toyed with the idea 
that 2006 (when Burma takes over the chairmanship of ASEAN) 
could be used as a target date for possible moves toward some 
powersharing with the NLD.  This is unrealistic - the regime, 
and most of all, Than Shwe, has no intention of sharing their 
place in the ASEAN sun with Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD. The 
regime\'s active regional diplomacy with its ASEAN partners, 
China, India, and Bangladesh plainly demonstrates its 
determination to show that the regime can maintain its power 
and gain regional acceptance, even legitimization, without 
any concessions to the democratic opposition. 
 
6. (C) Razali used the Tokyo ICG meeting to exhort the ASEAN 
members to use their good offices to push the regime to 
address economic and humanitarian issues, which would in turn 
impact positively on the political process.  We also 
understand that in contacts with our embassy in Jakarta he 
floated the idea of approaching the Indonesian government to 
use their influence on the regime.  It seems Razali thinks 
that perhaps the Indonesians can hold them out as an exemplar 
of a military government\'s transition to democracy and 
convince the SPDC that reforms are necessary.  However, we 
must agree with Jakarta\'s assessment of Razali\'s idea - it 
will have little resonance with the Indonesian military or 
foreign ministry - just as pressuring the junta for political 
or economic reform has no resonance with ASEAN as a whole. 
ASEAN\'s distaste for pressuring the regime was aptly 
illustrated at the Tokyo ICG where the Burmese FonMin 
successfully lobbied ASEAN countries to keep their 
Rangoon-based ambassadors at home (Ref  B). 
 
7. (C) Razali has also expressed interest in a so-called 
\"invitation to dialogue with the U.S.\"  issued by the regime 
a few days after the Tokyo ICG. Again, this is a misplaced 
hope. This press statement, in which the regime called on the 
U.S. to \"join us in open, constructive dialogue towards 
humanitarian, economic and political development,\" was never 
an official overture by the junta.  In fact, after we saw it 
in the foreign press, we contacted MOFA, which denied 
knowledge of the statement.  Two days later, the COM spoke 
personally with Secretary One (General Khin Nyunt), and the 
Deputy FonMin requesting a formal opportunity to explore the 
meaning of \"invitation to dialogue\", and the following week 
the COM posed the same question to Senior General Than Shwe. 
 The response from all the \"decision makers\"?  A weak smile, 
a nod, and an evasive \"yes, we can discuss it.\"   The only 
\"discussion\" of this \"invitation to dialogue\" has come from 
SPDC spokesman Col. Hla Min who said what was meant was that 
the regime was open to more visits by US officials as long as 
they did not \"come to lecture.\" 
 
8.  (C)Comment: What should Razali be aiming at on his tenth 
visit?  The Special Envoy is one of the few arrows that we 
have in the quiver and the visit could be our last shot, so 
he must be aimed directly at Senior General Than Shwe. Razali 
cannot accept a dismissive meeting on the fly as he did on 
his last visit - he must have substantial meetings with the 
Senior General.  Razali should also deliver a formal written 
message from SYG Annan expressing disappointment with the 
stalemate in the political dialogue, urging the immediate and 
unconditional release of all political prisoners, and urging 
the implementation of effective economic reform efforts. 
Razali must also insist on meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi (and 
not cave in to the Senior General as both he and PM Mahatir 
have done on their most recent trips).  There is no guarantee 
that any of these actions will push the SPDC down the path to 
dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi.  But they can signal to the 
regime that the \"comfort zone\" they have established in the 
region does not extend to the larger international community. 
 The regime must understand that a visible commitment to 
political dialogue and economic reform is the only way to 
mitigate international condemnation and address the country\'s 
continuing decline. End Comment.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 04/04/2013 
TAGS: PGOV, PINR, BM 
SUBJECT: SUCCESSION ISSUES 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: There are no laws or rules governing 
succession within the SPDC in Burma.  Nevertheless, Than 
Shwe, Maung Aye and Khin Nyunt have begun to line up 
successors, including in particular Lieutenant Generals Thura 
Shwe Mann, Soe Win and Tin Aung Myint Oo.  These are the 
three youngest members of the SPDC but apparently they 
already enjoy more of Than Shwe\'s confidence than any of the 
other officers on the Council.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The recent illness of the SPDC\'s No. 2, General Maung 
Aye, has focussed attention on how the SPDC will deal with a 
vacancy in one of its top three spots.  It has only dealt 
with such a problem once -- in 1993, when a mentally ill 
General Saw Maung was bumped aside in favor of his Deputy 
Than Shwe.  Since then the SPDC has twice purged lower 
ranking members of the council (in 1997 and 2001), and 
replaced Secretary 2 Tin Oo, who was killed in a helicopter 
crash, but has never touched the senior triumvirate of Than 
Shwe, Maung Aye, and Khin Nyunt. 
 
3. (C) There are reasons for this.  Most obviously, there is 
no law nor any rules governing succession at the top.  Senior 
General Than Shwe, as Commander in Chief of Defense Services 
and Prime Minister, can relieve or retire anyone below him in 
either the military or the government; no one can touch him, 
however.  There are no fixed terms of office, fixed 
retirement ages, or periodic votes within the SPDC regarding 
its own leadership.  So long as Than Shwe is able and willing 
to serve, and to serve in partnership with Maung Aye and 
Secretary 1 Khin Nyunt, all three will stay. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
The SPDC 
 
4. (C) Secondly, there is now a huge gap between the top 
three and all the other members of the SPDC.  In that regard, 
the SPDC is a very different animal from its predecessor, the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). SLORC was a 
college of near equal viceroys, with most members having not 
only seats on the council, but also individual ministerial 
portfolios and/or regional military commands.  In contrast, 
the 10 that now serve with the top 3 on the SPDC have little 
independent power or authority.  They include a chief of 
staff (Thura Shwe Mann), four aging special operations 
commanders, and five staff positions (including the Adjutant 
General, the Quartermaster General, and DGs for military 
training, defense industries, and air defense).  None of the 
10, however, has any direct command of combat troops or 
direct authority in local affairs.  Responsibilities in these 
areas are now largely left to the regional commanders, none 
of whom have seats on the SPDC.  Similarly, none of the 10 
hold any ministerial positions.  While most of Burma\'s 32 
ministries are still headed by active duty military officers, 
none of those ministers (with the exception of Prime Minister 
Than Shwe) sit on the SPDC. 
 
5. (C) In short, in Burma now, we are not dealing with a gang 
of thirteen.  We are dealing with a gang of three.  With 
perhaps three exceptions, the other ten on the SPDC are there 
largely as padding to keep the regional military commanders 
at some distance from the centers of national authority.  In 
one sense, this is simply insurance against a coup; in 
another, it is a natural separation of powers that 
effectively leaves only those at the very top in a position 
to direct the Army, the intelligence services and the 
government. 
 
6. (C) It also leaves succession issues entirely in the hands 
of the top 3.  With power now divided as it is, no one else 
in the SPDC, the government, or the regional commands is 
really in a position to influence that process.  Than Shwe 
and company will serve as long as they want and will choose 
their own successors when they leave. 
 
The Next Generation 
 
7. (C)  Right now, those designated successors appear to be 
the youngest members of the SPDC: Army Chief of Staff Thura 
Shwe Mann, the newly appointed Secretary 2 Soe Win, and, 
possibly, Quartermaster General Tin Aung Myint Oo.  All three 
are Lieutenant Generals, but their Burmese Commission Numbers 
(which indicate the dates of their commissions) and Defense 
Service Academy class numbers (11 and 12) suggest that all 
three entered the service years after their colleagues on the 
SPDC.  Thura Shwe Mann, in particular, is both a favorite of 
Than Shwe and an officer with a distinguished combat record. 
He is also the fourth ranking member of the SPDC and the only 
member of the military other than Than Shwe and Maung Aye 
with a complete view of the Army\'s operations.  Should Maung 
Aye die or step up into Than Shwe\'s position, then Thura Shwe 
Mann would likely take over as Commander in Chief of the 
Army.  Soe Win similarly would likely take over as Secretary 
1, if Khin Nyunt were to move up or step aside.  He is the 
least known of the three, but served as rector at the 
University for the Development of National Races in the 
mid-1990s and may have a reputation for being able to work 
with the ethnic minorities.  As for Quartermaster General Tin 
Aung Myint Oo, he simply seems to be a man with a future.  He 
has been picked by Than Shwe to coordinate the government\'s 
response to the current banking crisis and could step up into 
more general responsibilities for the economy, if he\'s 
successful and the SPDC restructures to create an independent 
position with responsibilities for economic affairs.  Right 
now, Maung Aye (the Chairman of the Trade Policy Committee) 
handles both economic and military affairs, while Khin Nyunt 
takes care of political issues. 
 
Potential Problems 
 
8. (C) This may all change as time goes on, of course.  SPDC 
members have a way of disgracing themselves (as in the case 
of former Secretary 3 Win Myint) and there really is no 
reason to believe that the most recently designated 
successors will be any more immune to the temptations of 
power than their predecessors have been.  Barring any such 
untoward events, however, the succession probably will run 
from Than Shwe to Maung Aye to Khin Nyunt, and then on to 
Thura Shwe Mann, Soe Win, and possibly Tin Aung Myint Oo. 
 
9. (C) In fact, in the entire succession, there is probably 
only one tricky issue, which involves handling Khin Nyunt and 
the position of Army Commander in Chief, if and when Maung 
Aye moves up or out.  As noted above, Lieutenant General 
Thura Shwe Mann is the logical choice to step in as Army 
Commander in Chief, when Maung Aye moves on.  However, he 
can\'t command Khin Nyunt, who is now the Army\'s only full 
general.  At the same time, Khin Nyunt would have trouble 
taking over as Army Commander in Chief himself, for two 
reasons.  First, Khin Nyunt\'s specialty is military 
intelligence; he has never held a combat command.  Secondly, 
he is an OTS graduate -- essentially the product of an ROTC 
program.  While this is not necessarily a problem for 
officers seeking senior ranks in the Burmese Army (Than Shwe 
himself is an OTS graduate), it is enough, when taken in 
conjunction with his lack of combat command experience, to 
raise questions as to whether the Army would accept him as 
their Chief. 
 
10. (C) This problem can be handled in a variety of ways, but 
our guess is that, when the time comes, the SPDC will simply 
split Maung Aye\'s current responsibilities, making Khin Nyunt 
Deputy Commander in Chief of Defense Services and No. 2 in 
the SPDC, while Thura Shwe Mann steps up to be Commander in 
Chief of the Army and No. 3 in the hierarchy.  That would 
keep ranks in order within the SPDC while still allowing the 
Army to be commanded by a man with combat experience. 
 
11. (C) In short, for all the risks that can surround any 
transition within a dictatorship, the SPDC\'s top three 
probably have the problem as well under control as could be 
expected. They\'ve basically found the men they want to use 
and while there are potential problems out there, there are 
also potential solutions that will avoid pointless rivalries. 
 This will all have to be tested when the time comes, but for 
now, the system appears strong and flexible enough to survive 
the loss of any one of the three at the top.

SUBJECT: CAN BURMA\'S RICE REFORMS WORK? 
 
REF: 02 RANGOON 1292 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Rice merchants are nervously anticipating 
the impending privatization of Burma\'s rice markets.  Though 
the long-term benefits of this step are manifold, a hurried 
implementation of this drastic policy could have some 
unwelcome side effects in the short haul.  End summary. 
 
GOB Washes it\'s Hands of Sticky Rice Trade 
 
2. (SBU) The GOB is preparing to turn over to the private 
sector all aspects of the rice trade, according to the Union 
of Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry (UMCCI), and the 
Rice Millers\' and Merchants\' Associations.  According to the 
businessmen, beginning with the next monsoon crop (sowed in 
June, harvested in October/November), farmers will be exempt 
from their usual mandatory advance sales to the government, 
and merchants will be allowed (with a few significant 
restrictions) to freely sell and export rice. 
 
3. (SBU) This sudden change of policy came as a bolt from the 
blue on March 31, when Secretary Two (Lt. Gen. Soe Win) 
called a snap meeting of the UMCCI and top rice merchants. 
According to a UMCCI official, as far as he knew, there had 
been no prior deliberations on changing rice policy, although 
the UMCCI and others had been lobbying for some time for the 
move.  There\'s also little evidence that the GOB had been 
consulting with international agriculture or privatization 
experts to draw up an effective strategy.  The official 
speculated that the government has grown increasingly 
concerned with the rising price of rice on the domestic 
market, and wanted to pass on to the private sector the 
responsibility for this sensitive issue. 
 
4. (SBU) The broad outlines of the GOB\'s privatization 
strategy trickled out in the March 31 meeting and a follow-up 
session on April 5.  Another confab is likely sometime after 
April 20.  Rice merchants say they think an official 
announcement of the policy change should come within the 
month, alongside the formation of a Rice and Paddy Trade 
Steering Committee that will direct and control all aspects 
of the privatization.  As envisioned, the Committee will be 
chaired by Lt. Gen. Soe Win.  Its membership will include the 
Ministers of Commerce, Agriculture, Industry (1), and Energy, 
and six private sector representatives. 
 
Freedom to Buy and Sell...Sort Of 
 
5. (SBU) Though the policy is not yet official, according to 
the UMCCI and rice merchants the regime will no longer 
purchase rice or paddy from farmers, leaving buying and 
milling to the private sector to arrange.  The GOB, through 
the Steering Committee, will determine the domestic demand 
for rice as well as the amount needed to continue 
compensating civil servants and the military.  There will 
also be a undetermined buffer built in for emergency and 
required ASEAN stockpiles.  The rice merchants will be 
required to sell this total amount to the Ministry of 
Commerce\'s Myanmar Agriculture Produce Trading (MAPT) company 
either at cost or at the prevailing market price. 
 
6. (SBU) Existing agricultural traders, as well as a number 
of new private export firms the UMCCI hopes to establish, 
will be free to export any surplus above this calculated 
amount.  The government will take its usual 10 percent export 
tax, and will require the exporter to exchange an additional 
50 percent of its export earnings with the GOB at a 
yet-undetermined rate.  The regime will also earn income from 
renting out MAPT warehouses to private exporters. 
 
Private Sector Sweats Lack of Technology, Education 
 
7. (SBU) Though the private sector representatives with whom 
we spoke were quite enthused about their new opportunity, 
they were also quite anxious.  They complained they\'d been 
given no time to prepare for this change, and were now 
rushing around trying to organize Rice Merchants\' Association 
branches across the country.  Additionally, they admitted 
that the private sector had no infrastructure to provide 
education and technology to farmers and merchants, keys to 
the success of this experiment.  Right now, a UMCCI official 
said, they were banking on promises of continued government 
support and a new program of loans or grants to help upgrade 
badly outdated milling equipment.  Without the education and 
new technology, one rice merchant warned, there\'s no way 
Burmese rice will compete in the long term. 
 
8. (SBU) Financing will also be a problem.  With only a 
couple of month\'s warning, rice growers will be stuck this 
season without the traditional government advance purchase 
payments that, while unfairly low, were still the farmers\' 
main source of cash to purchase seeds, fertilizer, fuel, and 
other inputs.  It is unclear whether the GOB\'s Myanmar 
Agricultural Development Bank will expand its currently 
paltry agricultural loan program to make up for this 
shortfall.  With the demise of the private banking sector, 
rice merchants and farmers may have to turn to the existing 
informal lending networks, with their exorbitant interest 
rates, in order to take full advantage of their new 
opportunity. 
 
Will Prices Fall? 
 
9. (SBU) With no preparation for change and a steep curve for 
improvement of technology and education, the hoped-for supply 
boom could be at least a season or two off.  However, newly 
liberated merchants are licking their lips over the potential 
demand for exports of Burmese paddy and milled rice, despite 
lackluster quality.  Bangladeshi traders clamor for as much 
paddy as they can grab, sparking robust border trade (legal 
and illegal) along the Rakhine State-Bangladesh frontier. 
Likewise, large global rice traders (such as Malaysia\'s 
Petronas) regularly come up short when the GOB suddenly 
re-allocates export rice for domestic consumption. 
 
10. (SBU) For rice traders, however, the devil of the new 
policy will lie in its details.  Rice has always been a 
politically sensitive product in Burma, and the government 
has in its hands more than enough power to ensure that the 
new market freedoms do not disrupt domestic supplies.  MAPT 
may exert effectively a right of first refusal on all major 
rice contracts; the government can cancel the export permits 
of companies whose actions threaten to be disruptive to 
markets; and, if all else fails, can simply ban rice exports. 
 Though they claim to have full faith in the GOB\'s 
intentions, traders are, of course, aware of this.  They have 
seen the business of foreign traders in beans and pulses 
handicapped by the decision last year to cease issuing 
permits to trade for foreign firms.  As a result, whatever 
the opportunities companies may see emerging from the new 
government rice policy, entrepreneurs almost certainly will 
move cautiously in risking their capital in these untested 
waters. 
 
11. (SBU) That said, government action in this area is 
welcome.  This may be a one-off move by the GOB, but it also 
could be the first step toward broader agricultural reforms 
that the Japanese, in particular, have been pushing as part 
of their economic adjustment programs.  If these first steps 
go well, others could follow.

SUBJECT: ASSK GIVES PRESS A DOWNBEAT ASSESSMENT OF HER YEAR 
OF FREEDOM 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  Aung San Suu Kyi told reporters and 
diplomats April 23 that her trips to various regions of the 
country reassured her that ethnic groups are anxious for 
national reconciliation.  She provided details on how the 
trips had been marred by attempts to intimidate NLD 
supporters.  ASSK also said there has been no progress on her 
dialogue with the SPDC and that relations have actually 
\"digressed\" somewhat.  It is becoming clear, she said, that 
the SPDC is simply not interested in national reconciliation. 
 She reiterated that basic NLD policies - on tourism, 
sanctions, investment assistance - will not change until 
there is real dialogue; however, the NLD stands ready to 
cooperate on humanitarian assistance.  Publicly critical of 
the regime for the first time since her release, ASSK 
appeared to be ratcheting up the pressure, if only slightly, 
for the regime to act on commitments for political 
transition.  End Summary. 
 
One-year Assessment 
 
2. (SBU)  In a press conference on April 23 at NLD 
headquarters, Aung San Suu Kyi provided an assessment of 
events since her release from house detention almost one year 
ago, on May 6, 2002.  She divided her remarks into two 
general themes: her travels around the country; and the 
status of NLD relations with the regime.  Her travels, she 
said, had demonstrated that the ethnic groups continue to 
have a strong desire to work toward national reconciliation 
if given a chance to participate in a \"true union\" of Burma. 
She also cited examples, however, of how the trips have been 
marred by authorities harassing her party and intimidating 
people interested in seeing her.  Photos of her recent visit 
to Chin State were on display showing, among other things, 
the large crowds that turned out and the six offices that she 
opened.  Also shown were photos of large logs laid across the 
road to impede her progress by Union Solidarity and 
Development Association (USDA) members and a group of USDA 
members who confronted her party on several occasions.  ASSK 
said that it was obvious that the USDA and Ministry officials 
who visited Chin State to discourage people from turning out 
for her visit were under orders from Rangoon.  She called on 
the SPDC to clarify the role of the USDA and explain why it 
has the power to take such actions if it is, as is claimed, 
only a social and welfare organization. 
 
No Progress On Reconciliation 
 
3. (SBU)  ASSK said it was very disappointing that since her 
release last May, the SPDC has not made any attempts to move 
forward with discussions on national reconciliation.  She 
said that her release was supposed to mark a shift from 
confidence building to more substantive exchanges including 
discussions on national reconciliation.  Instead, relations 
have been static and the SPDC seems to want to avoid any 
motion towards national reconciliation.  ASSK made the 
analogy of a child making excuses for not taking a bath; 
after a point it becomes clear that the child just does not 
want the bath.  She said that, based on the SPDC\'s continued 
avoidance of discussions on national reconciliation the NLD 
has had to conclude that the regime is just not interested. 
 
4. (SBU)  ASSK honed in on the insincerity of the SPDC\'s 
claims that it wants national reconciliation by noting that 
there has been no mention of the NLD or the SPDC\'s actions 
towards the party in the local media.  The regime\'s comments 
on reconciliation are always directed at the international 
press and diplomats, she claimed, indicating that the 
comments are intended only to mitigate international 
criticism.  She called on the SPDC to explain why it has 
never published any reports on confidence building, her 
trips, or national reconciliation, in the local press. 
 
5. (SBU)  ASSK also took the SPDC to task for its poor 
treatment of UN Special Envoy Razali, noting that if the 
authorities were serious about achieving reconciliation they 
would not restrict his travel to or activities within Burma. 
Specifically, ASSK said the SPDC should not have blocked 
Razali from visiting her in Taunggyi (Shan State) in November 
2002 or delayed his visits to the country, as they are 
reportedly currently doing. 
 
Policies Will Not Change Without Dialogue; Offer Stands For 
Cooperation On Assistance 
 
6. (SBU)  ASSK reiterated that with no dialogue on national 
reconciliation, the NLD will not change its basic policies on 
tourism, investment, sanctions, and assistance.  She noted 
that the NLD has continued to make it known that it would 
like to cooperate with the SPDC on humanitarian assistance 
projects but, even on high visibility problems such as 
HIV/AIDS, the authorities have indicated \"they are not 
interested in working together.\" 
 
7. (SBU)  In response to a question from an Australian 
reporter (ABC) on the Australian government\'s decision to 
move toward engagement with the SPDC while the EU and U.S. 
appear to be heading toward tighter sanctions, ASSK said she 
had clearly communicated her disappointment to the Australian 
government on its shift in policy.  She said the SPDC needs 
to be reminded that maintaining the status quo is not 
possible, change is inevitable and they should not attempt to 
block it (noting that as Buddhists they should know and 
accept this). 
 
8. (C)  Comment:  This was a more confrontational approach 
from ASSK than we have seen since confidential talks began in 
October 2000.  The lack of progress on dialogue one year 
after her release from house detention, coupled with 
continued and perhaps more systematic harassment on her trips 
around the country, apparently prompted a slight shift in 
strategy.  Still, she was somewhat cautious in her remarks 
and reiterated several times that there are no personal 
animosities between her and the SPDC and that she wants to 
work together for national reconciliation.  She appeared to 
be ratcheting up the pressure, albeit only slightly, for the 
regime to act on previous commitments for political 
transition.  We expect the regime will respond shortly with a 
press conference of its own.  End Comment.

SUBJECT:  A VISIT TO A WWII REMAINS RECOVERY SITE 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  COM, DASD Jerry Jennings (POW and MIA 
Affairs), DATT, and others inspected ongoing WWII remains 
recovery operations in Burma\'s northernmost Kachin State on 
March 23.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  After flying from Rangoon to the Kachin capital of 
Myitkyina aboard a USAF C-12 out of Bangkok, the USG 
delegation paid a courtesy call on the Burmese military\'s 
Northern Region Commander, Major General Maung Maung Swe. 
The COM, DASD, and party then flew 30 miles northwest of 
Myitkyina on a Lao West Coast leased helicopter to Burma 3, 
the crash site of a C-47 lost during WWII. 
 
3.  The CILHI recovery operation was being carried out on a 
steep slope at an altitude of approximately 7,500 feet. 
Most of the airplane wreckage visible on photographs taken 
some months earlier had been removed by pilferers prior to 
the team\'s arrival.  Still, the photographs provided enough 
identifying data to apparently correlate the crash site to a 
C-47A lost on August 19, 1944, with a manifested crew of 
seven. 
 
4.  After inspecting the recovery operation in Kachin State, 
the group flew back to Rangoon and met with S-1 General Khin 
Nyunt.  (NOTE: Khin Nyunt, the regime\'s third-ranking 
official and Chief of Military Intelligence, has been a 
staunch supporter of the remains recovery operation.  End 
Note)  During the call, DASD Jennings thanked the GOB for 
its good cooperation throughout the recovery operation and 
for providing increased security for the American recovery 
team due to the war in Iraq.  He asked the GOB to help 
protect crash sites from pilfering to allow U.S. 
anthropologists to better assess them, and to review the 
possibility of using GOB helicopters in support of future 
remains recovery operations. 
 
5.  General Khin Nyunt stated that the level of cooperation 
for this project was possible because of the cease-fires the 
GOB had reached with former ethnic insurgents that had long 
battled the GOB in the area.  He also gave assurances that 
the GOB would take measures to protect the sites from 
pilferage. 
 
6.  Comment:  The GOB\'s willingness to assist and its 
ability to gain cooperation from various cease-fire groups 
in Kachin State increases prospects for the success of 
future recovery operations.  Several probable crash sites 
have already been identified for possible excavation in the 
future.  Reporting of additional crash sites has already 
risen as the U.S. presence in Myitkyina has sparked the 
local population\'s interest in remains recovery operations.

Classified By: CDA, A.I. RON MCMULLEN, REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  EAP DAS Matt Daley, COM, and note taker 
spent over an hour and a half with Aung San Suu Kyi at her 
residence April 27 discussing a host of political issues.  UN 
Special Envoy Razali\'s influenced was undermined, in the NLD 
leader\'s view, when Malaysian PM Mahathir bowed to the 
regime\'s insistence that he not meet with her during his 
August visit.  The regime\'s harassment of ASSK and 
intimidation of NLD members mounted after her travel to 
ethnic states showed her strong backing there, she continued. 
 On national reconciliation, ASSK said the NLD is willing to 
cooperate but not submit, adding, \"cooperation can be carried 
just so far, if one side is not interested.\"  At the close of 
the long and productive meeting she said, \"I rely on you to 
take a firm stand--they only respond to pressure.\"  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) RAZALI PROCESS:  When COM asked if Mahathir\'s upcoming 
retirement had weakened Razali\'s standing with the SPDC, Aung 
San Suu Kyi agreed that much of Razali\'s influence is derived 
from his close relationship with Mahathir.  ASSK added that 
when Mahathir \"kowtowed\" to Than Shwe during the August visit 
and agreed to cancel a planned meeting with her, \"that hurt 
Raz and us.  It was after that that their attitude toward us 
began to harden.\"  She explained the SPDC thinking as, \"If 
Mahathir can be faced down, why bother with Razali?\" 
Regarding Razali\'s proposal that ASSK make suggestions to the 
SPDC on humanitarian assistance projects, she added, somewhat 
dismissively, \"I\'ve provided suggestions.\" 
 
3. (C) HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION:  ASSK said harassment 
began when her trip to Shan State in November showed she had 
widespread support among Burma\'s ethnic minorities.  She said 
the regime let her travel to Shan State because it gauged she 
had little support there, having only sampled opinion in a 
provincial capital populated by cautious civil servants. 
Outside the provincial capital the crowds were large and 
enthusiastic.  Harassment was bad in Arakan, she said, adding 
that the SPDC orchestrated \"systematic harassment to ensure 
my trip would not receive popular support.\"  It did 
nevertheless.  Intimidation continued in Chin State, although 
the harassment lessened somewhat when the NLD directly called 
the regime on this and asked that it be stopped, she noted. 
 
COMMENT:  The generals often justify four decades of military 
rule by the need to \"preserve the Union\" from fragmentation 
by ethnic separatists.  Does ASSK\'s support in ethnic areas 
show that the Union could be preserved by democratic means, 
thus jeopardizing the regime\'s self-proclaimed raison d\'etre? 
 END COMMENT. 
 
4. (C) DIALOGUE AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION:  ASSK said the 
generals need to \"get out of denial mode.\"  In Buddhism, she 
reflected, a good man admits his errors, but a wicked man 
does not.  She said the regime leaders \"are not good 
Buddhists, having a congenital inability to confront their 
own mistakes and shortcomings.\"  She said that if the SPDC 
thinks the NLD will put up with continued harassment and 
intimidation for the sake of reconciliation, \"they\'re 
mistaken.\"  \"This is blackmail.\"  She mused, \"How much more 
can we do?\"  \"We are prepared to cooperate but not submit.\" 
Regarding the lack of progress on dialogue, ASSK noted, \"They 
have the responsibility to give more--we are the aggrieved 
party.\"  She urged the U.S. to maintain its supportive stand, 
saying \"if they think you\'re going to act tough, they\'ll back 
down.\" 
 
5.  (C) RELATIONS WITH OTHER STATES: ASSK appreciated DAS 
Daley\'s overview of recent developments in Thailand, and 
offered comments on various states\' interactions with Burma. 
She was perhaps toughest on Australia and Japan, saying, 
\"They are dishonest and self-deceptive when they say they are 
doing something to help democracy; they are really concerned 
about relations with the regime.\"  ASSK said that China and 
the ASEAN countries were more straightforward and therefore 
perhaps easier to deal with.  She singled out the ambassador 
of the Philippines as the instigator of an effort to close 
off all contact between her and the ASEAN ambassadors.  She 
admitted having a soft spot for India, explaining that 
India\'s warming with the SPDC was primarily a reaction to 
Chinese inroads in Burma. 
 
6.  (C) SANCTIONS, AID:  Regarding any prospective U.S. trade 
ban, ASSK said she intended to stay at arm\'s length from the 
issue, stating, \"If it were to happen, it would be much 
better if it comes from you as your own decision.\"  Aung San 
Suu Kyi expressed strong interest in continued financial 
support for Prospect Burma, a scholarship program for Chin 
and other exiles in India.  She asked for two small favors: 
assistance in procuring a low-light camcorder to record 
evening events and incidents on her upcountry travels, and 
help in finding a second-hand Toyota SUV that she could 
purchase.  She also told of a village in Sagaing Division 
threatened by USDA supporters.  The USDA warned that if the 
villagers turned out to cheer ASSK, their village would be 
burned down.  They did and it was.  The NLD is investigating 
this incident.  If in fact the village was torched as 
reported, ASSK said it would be a powerful statement to 
supporters of democracy if this village could be rebuilt 
(stealthily, with NLD and USG help). 
 
7.  (C) Than Shwe\'s \"Little Secret Weapon:\" Aung San Suu Kyi 
said the regime had intended to turn the Union Solidarity 
Development Association (USDA) into a political party though 
which the generals could continue to run the country, perhaps 
in a more acceptable, quasi-democratic guise.  \"I don\'t think 
this will work,\" ASSK opined.  She said that unlike Ne Win\'s 
socialist party, which was supported by some people on 
ideological grounds, there is no ideology associated with the 
SPDC or the USDA.  It is only patronage and repression that 
keeps the regime together, she said.  Some lower ranking 
military officers are disillusioned and want change, while 
others are awaiting their turn at the trough, she concluded. 
 
8.  (C) COMMENT:  Aung San Suu Kyi, who looked healthy and 
relaxed, was in a talkative, reflective, and strategic 
mood--she was perhaps drawn out by Daley\'s visit.  Somewhat 
uncharacteristically, she thanked him at length for a book he 
had given her on a previous visit, and said she hoped he 
would return soon.  He said he might be back in the region in 
June.  Often visitors see a harried, detail-driven, and 
determined (bordering on stubborn) ASSK, but on this occasion 
she had a broader picture in mind and seemed eager to talk, 
and to listen. End Comment. 
 
9.  (U) DAS Daley has cleared this message.

SUBJECT: BURMA HRDF GRANT PROPOSALS 
 
REF: STATE 79965 
 
OVERVIEW 
 
1. (U)  Embassy Rangoon submits the four proposals described 
below in response to reftel request for projects promoting 
democracy and human rights.  The projects were chosen because 
they directly support U.S. goals in Burma in regard to 
strengthening civil society and democratic principles.  They 
are small projects which bolster the efforts of local 
organizations to instill and nurture critical thinking, 
freedom of expression, and, ultimately, self-determination in 
a society where these practices have been almost eliminated 
by 40 years of harsh military rule.  Three projects focus on 
ethnic minority groups while one would work with youth 
located in Rangoon.  All are grassroots projects with 
potential for long-term benefits beyond HRDF resources. 
 
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES/REQUIREMENTS 
 
2. (SBU)  Because the military government attempts to closely 
control the activities of all organizations in the country 
and is suspicious of the motives behind any Western funding, 
these projects will require careful implementation to avoid 
endangering the local organizations.  While Embassy 
representatives will be able to occasionally visit the 
organizations or project sites in conjunction with general 
Embassy business, and the organizations will be able to 
provide full accounting for all funding, any overt 
acknowledgement of the projects as State Department funded 
activities could jeopardize the local organizations.  For 
this same reason, funding would have to be disbursed in cash 
rather than bank transfers (which are monitored).

logistical arrangements to the Embassy point of contact: 
Political Officer John Haynes.  The proposals have been sent

4. (SBU)  Begin text of proposals: 
 
PROJECT ONE - ETHNIC MINORITY DIALOGUE INITIATIVES 
 
Background:  The Metta and Shalom Foundations (local NGO\'s) 
recently formed the Ethnic Mediators Fellowship (EMF) ) a 
group of 25 key persons from various ethnic groups who are 
directly involved in political mediation in Burma.  These 
individuals are involved in facilitating dialogue within 
their own ethnic groups in order to develop a greater sense 
of unity and common vision. The EMF is a key group 
strategically placed to support dialogue within ethnic groups 
and collaborative efforts across ethnic lines. Though the 
overall EMF group is currently being provided with training 
and consultations, individual ethnic teams are often 
underfunded and unable to move the dialogue process forward 
within their own ethnic group. 
 
Goal:  Enhance and encourage the dialogue processes within 
three ethnic groups by assisting with the logistical expenses 
of the mediator teams. 
 
Budget:  $15,000 for one year. 
 
Expected Outcome:  Three ethnic groups will have planned and 
conducted dialogue sessions within their ethnic communities. 
The experience gained from these dialogue sessions will 
inform the groups, thinking about future processes and will 
assist in establishing dialogue as a means by which conflict 
can be addressed. 
 
PROJECT TWO: SUMMER SCHOOL YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
 
Background:  Few opportunities exist in Burma for youth to 
develop the requisite skills to be productive members of a 
functioning democracy. The formal education program uses only 
rote memorization and few models exist which promote critical 
thinking skills.  Though the formal educational system has 
been constrained by the military government policies of the 
past 40 years, informal mechanisms exist to build these 
capabilities. One such possibility is through the summer 
youth camps conducted by private cultural, social, and 
religious groups.  These youth camps already teach ethnic 
minority languages, art, music, and other activities. A group 
of motivated individuals can supplement the existing programs 
with approaches which enhance creativity and critical 
thinking skills. Assistance is needed, however, in developing 
a curricula and training an initial group of teachers to 
pilot such a program. 
 
Goal:  Enhance the creative, critical thinking, and 
communication skills of youth. 
 
Budget:  $10,000 for one year. 
 
Expected Outcome:  Curricula will have been developed, 5 
teachers will have been trained, and the curricula tested 
during the March - May 2004 school holiday. 
 
PROJECT THREE - NON-FORMAL CIVIC EDUCATION PROGRAM 
 
Background:  There has been growing interest by civic 
organizations in Burma who are looking for ways to implement 
a non-formal civic education curriculum in boarding hostels, 
vocational training programs, summer camp and school 
programs, as well as other venues.  The program desired would 
teach students about self-governance and participation, 
conflict resolution, respect for diversity and social 
responsibility. 
The Myanmar Institute of Theology (MIT) would like to better 
develop a civic education curriculum that was developed in 
the late 1990,s, implemented by the Kachin Baptist 
Convention (KBC).  This curriculum continues to be used in 
the KBC,s boarding hostels around the country.  MIT proposes 
to build upon the KBC,s civic education curriculum, and make 
it more broadly available for use by other groups and in 
other settings.  This will require a review of the curriculum 
and its adaptation to other cultural settings. 
 
MIT has the ability to provide the monitoring, reporting and 
accounting required for this project, as well as to provide 
staff to implement the technical aspects of this project, in 
conjunction with other resources available in the community. 
 
Goal:  Revise and update a civic education curriculum and 
make it available for use in multiple, non-formal education 
settings in Burma. 
 
Budget:  $10,000 for one year. 
 
PROJECT FOUR - KAREN DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE CIVIL EDUCATION 
AND CAPACITY BUILDING 
 
Background:  The Karen Development Committee (KDC) is an 
unofficially organized, nationwide group of Karen community 
members who are actively supporting and undertaking programs 
for the social and political development of all Karen people 
in Burma.  KDC membership draws from all the major regions 
where Karen people live, as well as all the ethnic subgroups, 
and religious backgrounds. 
 
Objectives:  During 2003-4, the KDC is forming chapters in 
the five geographic regions where Karen people are 
concentrated, and is seeking financial assistance to 
undertake the objectives of: 
 
-- Planning and establishing the KDC regional networks of 
people in these areas to undertake social organizing, 
encourage dialogue between intra-ethnic factions, and 
implement development projects; and 
 
-- Conducting workshops in the regions on topics which could 
include social organizing; civic education; peace education; 
planning for development projects; the faces of power; and 
women and development. 
 
The Karen Development Committee has the capacity to provide 
for accounting, monitoring and reporting for the use of any 
funds received. 
 
Budget:  US$15,000 is requested for one year.

SUBJECT: REGIME RELEASES SALAI TUN THAN, 20 OTHER POLITICAL 
PRISONERS 
 
1. (U)  In a May 4 press release, the State Peace and 
Development Council (SPDC) announced the release of 21 
political prisoners.  Dr. Salai Tun Than, a well-respected 
academic who was arrested for staging a one-man political 
demonstration in 2001 was among those released.  Salai Tun 
Than is an alumni of the University of Georgia and, as a 
result, has been of particular Congressional and Embassy 
interest since his arrest.  In fact, COM Martinez raised 
Salai Tun Than\'s case directly with the third-ranking general 
in the regime, Secretary One General Khin Nyunt, in a meeting 
on April 27.  This appears to be what triggered his release. 
Poloff met with Salai Tun Than and two of his daughters 
(including Yuzana, with whom Poloff has met previously) on 
May 5 and found him tired but well and extremely happy to be 
out of prison.  Salai Tun Than said authorities made a 
special point of telling him that his release was not the 
result of any external pressure.  He told Poloff, however, 
that in his opinion prisoner releases would only occur as a 
direct result of pressure. 
 
2. (U)  The professor also reported that he had been required 
to sign a \"Section 401\" agreement, which obligated him to 
serve the remaining balance of his sentence if he is taken 
into custody again.  He said he was a little nervous about 
how the authorities might react to a  meeting with Poloff but 
he was taking the chance because he has had contacts with the 
Embassy in the past.  He said he plans to return to his 
earlier activities as much as possible (advocating 
agricultural reforms for Chin farmers), hoping that if he is 
\"transparent\" in his activities, authorities will have no 
grounds to rearrest him. 
 
3. (U)  Regarding his recent hunger strike, Dr. Tun Than said 
prison authorities quickly acceded to most of his demands (no 
hoods on political prisoners, permission to possess a Bible, 
a clock in the ward of political prisoners at the prison 
hospital) so he called off the strike after just two days. 
He said just prior to the hunger strike on April 27, prison 
authorities had begun questioning him about the activities he 
might undertake if he were released.  The professor now 
realizes that authorities were already considering whether to 
release him at that time.  He said he told the authorities he 
planned to thank the NLD\'s Aung San Suu Kyi for her party\'s 
support for his family during his incarceration.  The 
authorities told him this was not a wise thing and he said he 
agreed that he would not do it if he were a \"normal\" citizen, 
but he had a special situation and would want to pay his 
respects.  He said the authorities finally relented when he 
invited them along to visit the NLD, but cautioned him to not 
discuss politics. 
 
 
4. (U)  Among the other political prisoners released, there 
were 12 NLD members, including two who are well-known in the 
organization.  Win Thein was a young student who provided 
security for Aung San Suu Kyi in the early days of the party. 
 He was arrested in 1989 and is now 36 years old.  Ms. Kyi 
Kyi Win is an NLD member from a Rangoon suburb who has been 
jailed since 1998 because of activism on behalf of the party 
in all parts of the country.  NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo told 
Poloff, \"she used to give Military Intelligence fits!\"  The 
NLD was pleased to have the releases but noted that there are 
many more cases of old, and infirm political prisoners, many 
of whom have been in prison well past their original 
sentences.

1. (C) Summary: The new Japanese \"Three Pillars\" strategy of 
humanitarian aid, economic reform, and democracy was 
officially unveiled on April 29.  The Japanese ambassador in 
Rangoon explained the details and origin of this policy to 
the Chief of Mission (COM) during a lunch on May 5.  Though 
he did not expect U.S. support, the ambassador asked for U.S. 
understanding and pointed out how the U.S. and Japan 
strategies might be complementary in achieving democratic 
reform.  End summary. 
 
The Three Pillars Strategy 
 
2. (C) During a lunch at his residence on May 5, Ambassador 
Miyamoto gave a readout to the COM, DCM, and Economic Officer 
(notetaker) on the recent visit to Rangoon of former Prime 
Minister Yoshio Mori.  Mori visited April 29-May 2 on behalf 
of two private Japanese foundations.  The ambassador stressed 
that Mori was not an envoy of the Japanese government. 
 
3. (C) The former prime minister met with the SPDC leader, 
Senior General Than Shwe, and delivered to him a letter from 
current Japanese PM Junichiro Koizumi explaining the new 
Japanese \"Three Pillars\" strategy for relations with Burma. 
This policy, which the Japanese government described in 
detail at the February Informal Consultative Group on Burma 
meeting (Ref C) is founded on the concept of \"total 
engagement\" with the Burmese regime; engaging on humanitarian 
aid, economic reform, and progress toward democracy. 
 
4. (C) The ambassador clarified the reasoning behind this 
definitive Japanese policy shift.  He characterized Japan\'s 
recent Burma policy as fickle and rootless, changing with the 
political winds.  These vagaries had eroded the traditional 
trust and influence that Japan felt it had with the regime 
and the Burmese people, adding that the Burmese people had a 
\"warm place in their heart for the Japanese.\"  The ambassador 
said that upon arriving in the summer of 2002, he began to 
examine the situation on the ground to see how the Japanese 
might reassert themselves.  His conclusion was that the 
Japanese government should rebuild its foundation of trust 
with the Burmese regime through 360-degree engagement.  He 
contrasted this with the Chinese and ASEAN engagement 
policies that provide assistance without pushing for 
political or economic reforms, and with the U.S. and European 
policies that rely on sanctions and pressure for reform with 
no assistance. 
 
5. (C) The new policy is ambitious and, the ambassador 
admitted, quite risky.  However, the ambassador opined that 
something new was needed to break the current impasse, and 
thus it was worth a try.  He was unable to respond, though, 
to the COM\'s questions regarding the specific measurements 
of, or a timetable for, the policy\'s success or failure.  He 
would only say that success would be measured in 
(unspecified) political reform.  Later in the meeting, the 
ambassador, who clearly has a large personal stake in the 
policy\'s success, indicated that a personal goal for him 
would be substantial progress within a five-year time frame, 
though again it was unclear what exactly the endgame was. 
The new Japanese policy will have no conditionality, nor will 
it receive a large budget for implementation.  Instead, 
proposed projects would be approved for funding by Tokyo on a 
case by case basis. 
 
Trust But Verify 
 
6. (C) Miyamoto stressed that at this point the strategy is 
focused only on rebuilding trust and relations with SPDC 
decisionmakers.  He pointed out his aim to gain easier access 
to SPDC Secretary One, General Khin Nyunt, and the frank 
exchange of views between ex-PM Mori and Senior General Than 
Shwe.  When the COM asked how the Japanese would ensure that 
messages about political and economic reform would get 
through to the top, the ambassador quickly replied that if 
this problem arose PM Mori (or another senior envoy) could 
return to deliver the message personally.  According to 
Ambassador Miyamoto, PM Mori had invited Senior General Than 
Shwe to spend two or three days in Tokyo as \"his guest\" 
following Japan-ASEAN meetings coming up in December. 
 
7. (C) The ambassador claimed that if he had closer ties with 
Burmese leaders he would be able to read their intentions, 
and that their close ties would keep the SPDC honest.  He 
said that the Burmese government would respond better to 
earnest requests for necessary changes from a government with 
whom it has good personal ties, than to demands and pressure 
from hostile governments.  The COM was skeptical of the 
Japanese reliance on trust and goodwill as the basis for the 
policy\'s success. 
 
8. (C) If the relationships are established, the Japanese 
will push forward with their specific objectives.  The UN\'s 
overdue humanitarian assessment was mentioned as a possible 
benchmark for basic human needs assistance, while the 
long-awaited Japan-Burma economic structural adjustment 
review would be the economic starting point.  It was less 
clear what the Japanese had in mind for an opening gambit on 
the political side.  However, the Ambassador said he would 
use his hoped-for new relationships to push the SPDC to give 
increased importance to the visits of UN Envoys Razali and 
Pinheiro. 
 
Don\'t Stand in the Way 
 
9. (C) The overall message, diplomatically conveyed, was that 
the Japanese were going to try a bold new policy, and while 
they didn\'t expect U.S. support, they hoped that the United 
States would not object.  Ambassador Miyamoto told the COM at 
least twice that he thought the United States and Japan could 
work together with complementary policies aimed at the same 
objective -- democracy in Burma.  We are not yet 100 percent 
convinced that Japan\'s intention is as wholeheartedly 
democratic as the ambassador claimed.  Although it could be 
helpful to have a close ally, who at least professes to be in 
favor of democratic reform, with good access to Senior 
General Than Shwe, we remain skeptical that the regime 
understands that the goal of the Japanese policy is political 
reform and transition to democracy.

SUBJECT: 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF \"SIAM-BURMA DEATH RAILWAY\" 
COMMEMORATED 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  COM, DATT, and others participated in a 
May 1 Australia-organized ceremony commemorating the 60th 
anniversary of the infamous Siam-Burma Death Railway.  133 
Americas were among the estimated 12,000 Allied POWs who 
perishing while slaving on the railway\'s construction.  This 
was the first time the GOB has permitted the C-12 out of 
Bangkok to fly from Rangoon to Moulmein (Mawlamyine).  The 
usual high-profile presence of Military Intelligence minders 
was largely absent during this trip and the GOB did not 
attempt to place a \"safety officer\" on board the C-12. 
Perhaps the GOB\'s lighter touch on this trip was an 
outgrowth of the successful, confidence-building WWII 
remains recovery mission concluded last month.   END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) Four surviving Australian POWs were among the 60 or 
so mostly Australian civilians who traveled to Thanbyuzarat, 
the Burma terminus of the railway constructed with forced 
POW and \"native\" labor in WWII.  The COM joined the 
Australian and British ambassadors for a short service at 
the cemetery, at which former POW Dr. Rowley Richards was 
the keynote speaker.  The surviving POWs were the event\'s 
center of focus and willingly shared their memories and 
experiences.  Dr. Richards recounted that, while en route to 
a POW camp in Japan after the completion of the railway, his 
ship was torpedoed by a U.S. submarine.  He was fished out 
of the ocean by a lifeboat and arrived in Japan just prior 
to the nuclear attacks.  As a prison doctor he undoubtedly 
saved many American lives, commenting, \"On my rounds I used 
to linger longer than I should have with the Americans, as I 
was fascinated by the accents of your chaps from the Bronx.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) This was the first time the GOB has permitted the 
C-12 out of Bangkok to fly from Rangoon to Moulmein 
(Mawlamyine).  Flying on the C-12 saved the Embassy group a 
15-hour round-trip drive over dangerous roads.  Situated 100 
miles and a 35-minute flight southeast of Rangoon, Moulmein 
is Burma\'s fourth largest city and a former capital of 
British Lower Burma.  Airport formalities were non-existent 
in Moulmein and apart from a slightly delayed takeoff 
(caused by a dog napping on the tarmac), the flights were 
without incident.  The blacktop road running 40 miles south 
from Moulmein to Thanbyuzarat winds through miles of rubber 
plantations; although in past years the area has been 
plagued by insurgency, the road featured only one security 
checkpoint.  Embassy Rangoon extends its thanks to Embassy 
Bangkok, particularly to the DAO and C-12 crew, for the 
generous use of the aircraft. 
 
4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  We noted that the normal high-profile 
presence of Military Intelligence minders was largely absent 
during this trip.  Further, the GOB did not attempt to place 
a \"safety officer\" on board the C-12 this time.  This was 
also the first year the GOB permitted the Australian embassy 
to host a formal ceremony at Thanbyuzarat.  Perhaps the 
GOB\'s lighter touch on this trip was an outgrowth of the 
successful, confidence-building WWII remains recovery 
mission concluded last month.  End Comment. MARTINEZ

1. (C) SUMMARY:  EAP DAS Matt Daley, COM, and DCM (note 
taker) met with Secretary 1, General Khin Nyunt April 27 in 
Rangoon.  General Khin Nyunt emphasized counter-terrorism 
cooperation and the added security the GOB has provided to 
the U.S. Embassy.  Daley urged the GOB to accelerate dialogue 
with the NLD, to increase press freedoms, and to release more 
political prisoners.  Since the meeting, twenty-one political 
prisoners have been released, including Dr. Salai Tun Than 
(Ref B). According to the Burmese embassy in Washington, Dr. 
Salai Tun Than\'s release was ordered in direct response to 
DAS Daley\'s request.  He also called on Senior General Than 
Shwe to meet with UN Special Envoy Razali soon.  S-1 said 
Razali would be invited for a visit in June.  The General 
said Aung San Suu Kyi was \"conceited\" and although allowed to 
travel around the country, had criticized the government in a 
\"very condescending manner.\"  DAS Daley suggested he \"set 
aside the protocol book, invite her to lunch, and sit down 
and talk with her with no set agenda.\"  Results of the 
demarche requested Ref A were reported separately.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) COUNTER-TERRORISM: Secretary 1, General Khin Nyunt 
(the head of Military Intelligence and the third-ranking 
officer in the ruling State Peace and Development Committee) 
was accompanied by the Foreign Minister, the Deputy Foreign 
Minister, and three other officials during the call by Daley, 
COM, and DCM. 
 
-- After reftel demarche was delivered and discussed (see 
septel reply to Ref A), Khin Nyunt spoke of the close 
counter-terrorism cooperation extended by the GOB to the USG, 
highlighting the added security provided the embassy during 
the war in Iraq.  Daley thanked S-1 for the added security 
and noted that terrorism in Southeast Asia was a bigger 
concern than many people had previously realized. 
 
-- Khin Nyunt recounted the March 27 bomb attacks in Rangoon, 
reporting one fatality (vice two, as we had previously 
thought).  Daley noted that when we learned of these 
bombings, we called them acts of terrorism and condemned 
them.  S-1 also termed the recent sabotage of a natural gas 
pipeline, reportedly by KNU insurgents, a terrorist attack. 
(NOTE: the GOB has frequently attempted to blur the 
distinction between terrorism per se and other forms of 
violence related to ongoing ethnic insurgencies.) 
 
-- The general added, \"We are trying our best to prevent 
terrorism--we are taking steps to assure that our country 
will not be used as a stepping stone to export terrorism to 
other countries.\" 
 
3. (C) DIALOGUE WITH THE NLD: Daley stated that there is a 
sense of disappointment in the U.S. and in the broader 
international community that the process of dialogue appears 
to be losing momentum.  We would hope this process could be 
accelerated, DAS Daley emphasized.  General Khin Nyunt 
responded pointedly, saying: 
 
\"We are not trying to avoid dialogue with the NLD, but she 
(ASSK) is very conceited.  Anyway, she has not yet proposed 
any dialogue.  We let her travel in the country and what does 
she do?  She criticizes the government in a very 
condescending manner and stirs up the people against the 
government.\" 
 
Daley commented that while Aung San Suu Kyi was undoubtedly 
strong-willed both in personality and principles, the 
government is powerful, and need not fear destabilization if 
it moves forward on the democracy and human rights agenda. 
Further, he had never known her to make a disrespectful 
comment about the military as an institution even as she 
called for a transformed polity.  DAS Daley urged Khin Nyunt 
to set aside the protocol book, invite Aung San Suu Kyi to 
lunch, and open a discussion with no set agenda. 
 
4. (C) POLITICAL PRISONERS: Daley made a strong pitch to Khin 
Nyunt to make a mass release of political prisoners as soon 
as next month, adding that freeing all the political 
prisoners would not threaten regime stability.  This would be 
seen as an act of confidence and good faith by other nations, 
international organizations, and potential business partners. 
 The more serious threat to the regime is economic, DAS Daley 
continued, and an act of confidence and good faith could help 
on that front.  COM proposed that, pending the release of all 
political prisoners, the GOB release a group of approximately 
190 prisoners who are suffering from severe physical and 
mental illnesses.  COM and DAS also requested that an Embassy 
consular officer be allowed to visit Dr. Salai Tun Than, as 
his case has generated substantial congressional and public 
interest and concern in the United States.  Regarding all 
three proposals, General Khin Nyunt nodded and said, \"I will 
look into it.\" (Note: Per Ref B, three political prisoners 
were released just a few days after this meeting.  Dr. Salai 
Tun Than and 17 other political prisoners were released on 
May 4th.  According to the Burmese embassy in Washington, the 
release of Dr. Salai Tun Than was ordered in direct response 
to DAS Daley\'s request.  End Note). 
 
5.  (C) THE MEDIA: At Aung San Suu Kyi\'s request, DAS Daley 
commented that the GOB-controlled media does not acknowledge 
or even mention the NLD, in contrast to the regime\'s press 
releases to foreign governments and media outlets, which 
frequently mention prospects for possible cooperation or 
talks with the NLD.  Could there be a bit more openness in 
the local media?  S-1 did not respond. 
 
6. (SBU) RAZALI: When DAS Daley pressed Khin Nyunt to invite 
UN Special Envoy Razali back to Burma quickly and to assure 
that he meets with Senior General Than Shwe, Khin Nyunt 
replied that unfortunately the schedule for May was full.  He 
was happy to announce, however, that Razali had just been 
invited to come back in June. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT: As always, Khin Nyunt conducted himself in 
the polished, professional manner that has become something 
of his trademark.  Within a regime of distinctly unpolished 
generals, one of his key roles is to be the presentable face 
of the SPDC to foreigners.  He was cordial and seemingly 
agreeable even on the issue of a mass political prisoner 
release.  However, he lost his suavity momentarily when 
describing Aung San Suu Kyi.  There is clearly no love lost 
between them.  Interestingly, as Daley made the point on 
moving the political dialogue forward, the MFA attendees and 
even Major Myo Aung could be seen to nod their heads in 
agreement.  End Comment. 
 
8. (U) DAS Daley has cleared on this message.

1. (C) Summary: The future is not clear, and certainly not 
bright, at end of the second full month of the Burmese 
banking crisis.  The banks\' restrictions on withdrawals are 
still in place as are orders that banks recover outstanding 
loans.  Bankers continue to speculate on mergers and 
bankruptcies, though none have yet gone under.  Companies\' 
ability to muddle through, and the resurgence of the 
underground financial system, have managed to contain the 
economic spillover in the short term.  However, the absence 
of effective private banks will constrain long-term growth 
and may hinder future economic reforms.  End summary. 
 
The End is Nigh? 
 
2. (C) Bankers and businessmen are more certain than ever 
that the private banking system is finished.  During the 
month of April the government remained silent on the banks\' 
problems and made no move to lessen controls on the banks or

limits also remained at 100,000 kyat (about $100) per week 
per depositor, and new deposits were negligible, because of 
low public confidence in the banking system, and the 
government\'s refusal to sanction special treatment for new 
depositors.  The GOB\'s Private Bank Management Committee 
continues to meet nightly, requiring all private banks to 
submit records of that day\'s withdrawals, deposits, and loan 
repayments. 
 
3. (C) For the second month in a row, the private banks, 
under order from the Bank Management Committee to bring in as 
much as 70 percent of their loans by the end of April, are 
leaning on their borrowers (with the help of Military 
Intelligence) to repay as much, and as quickly, as possible. 
The Committee seems to be focused primarily on the larger 
banks, like Yoma Bank, AWB, and KBZ Bank, which had the vast 
majority of outstanding (and likely rotten) loans, and which 
were recipients of Central Bank advances at the start of the 
crisis.  However, even the smaller banks are under pressure 
from the authorities, and from their own deteriorating bottom 
lines, to call in what they can. 
 
4. (C) Despite this pressure, large and small bankers tell us 
that they had little success meeting their April objectives. 
One banker blamed a continuing slowdown of the economy, plus 
the general need for cash around the Burmese New Year 
festivities (April 13-17), for the sluggish recouping of 
loans.  On top of zero deposit growth, the slowing of loan 
repayments has led to worsening cash positions in April for 
the banks with whom we spoke. 
 
Industry Continues to Limp Along 
 
5. (C) On the bright side, it appears that the majority of 
employers met payroll again in April.  So far it appears that 
banks are willing (with Committee approval) to open their 
safes for large corporate customers.  The Union of Myanmar 
Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) 
reports that none of its members is complaining about an 
inability to pay workers.  According to one banker, the Bank 
Management Committee has been very willing to approve 
requests for withdrawals over 100,000 kyat for emergencies 
such as payroll and tax payments.  However, the Committee 
reportedly often authorizes only 50-75 percent of the amount 
requested. 
 
6. (C) Though it is too early to make any confident 
assertions, there are some signs that the liquidity crisis 
may be easing, at least so far as the real economy is 
concerned.  Apparently, enough cash has returned to 
circulation to restart some commerce, raise some asset 
prices, and fund a measure of capital flight.  In any event, 
beginning in mid-April, the price of the dollar and some used 
cars started to creep back up (the dollar gaining 8 percent 
on the kyat after declining nearly 20 percent in February and 
March).  We give credit to the already large informal banking 
network in Burma, which was able to take over a portion of 
private banks\' lending, payment, and remittance activities. 
Banking, in short, hasn\'t so much died in Burma as just gone 
partially underground. 
 
What\'s the Plan? 
 
7. (C) Private bankers argue that the GOB\'s policies seem 
designed to bankrupt the private banks or force them into 
mergers with their state or military-owned counterparts. 
Some even hint that the GOB might move at the end of May, 
when 100 percent of outstanding loans are ostensibly due for 
repayment to the largest banks.  However, an official in one 
of the country\'s larger banks said that at the current rate 
his bank could survive another 2-3 months before giving up 
the ghost.  An official at a smaller private bank said that 
his institution could last at least through September. 
8. (C) The government itself has been silent on its plans. 
Nevertheless, it may view its actions as simply a prudent way 
to squeeze speculative excesses out of the economy and hold 
bankers accountable for their previous misdeeds.  The 
relatively quick deflation of asset bubbles, and stable 
consumer prices since the regime began its tough-love 
strategy are taken as proof by top GOB officials that this 
type of approach has been effective in dealing with the 
banking problem while protecting the country\'s economic 
situation. 
 
Comment: \"Bankers\" or \"Banking\" Crisis? 
 
9. (C) For all the dire predictions of disaster that 
accompanied the initial run on the banks and the decision to 
limit withdrawals, the Burmese economy seems to be coping. 
Trade continues, most retail prices have stabilized, and 
payrolls are being met -- though some large construction 
projects have stopped.  In part this is due to the cash-based 
character of the Burmese economy.  Few people ever used 
banks; the 550 billion kyat in recorded deposits at the 
private banks in fact was only one-third to one-quarter of 
estimated total money in circulation.  The underground honti 
exchange system has also been able to step up to provide a 
ready substitute for at least a portion of the private banks\' 
payment services.  More expensive and less reliable than 
private banks, the honti system is nevertheless available 
everywhere in Burma.  Finally, the net value added by private 
banks to Burma\'s economy had declined in recent years as the 
banks, faced with ever expanding inflation and debilitating 
government banking regulations, moved more and more into 
speculative investments of doubtful economic value.  That has 
stopped, hurting speculators -- in many cases bankers 
themselves. 
 
10. (C) In short, the longer this episode continues, the more 
it appears to be a crisis for the individual banks rather 
than Burma\'s economy as a whole.  In the end, some private 
banks and some large families may be bankrupted, but to judge 
by events to date, the economy will continue to tick along, 
albeit at a slower pace.  Nevertheless, there will be a price 
to pay.  Unless government banks can pick up the slack, the 
inevitable chill on economic expansion and commerce caused by 
the lack of a formal banking sector might limit the potential 
for future economic reforms, such as the recent 
liberalization of the rice market.

SUBJECT: BURMA: WHO WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR FREEING RICE? 
 
REF: RANGOON 448 
 
1. (C) Summary: The GOB\'s official announcement of its rice 
liberalization policy answered the questions: who, what, 
where, and when.  However, why, how, and how much are still 
vague.  Until these questions are answered, the success of 
the new policy will be uncertain.  However, we are encouraged 
by the direction the government seems to be taking in the 
agricultural sector, and hope that it will continue.  End 
summary. 
 
Unfunded Mandates 
 
2. (SBU) The details of the government\'s new rice policy, 
announced officially on April 24, were largely as reported in 
reftel.  However, there are four key areas left unaddressed 
or vague in the regime\'s announcement.  First and foremost is 
the question of funding for the new reform policy.  The 
government avows that it will no longer force farmers to sell 
in advance, at prices well below the market, a certain number 
of baskets of paddy.  Instead, the GOB will procure from 
merchants at their \"purchase price\" whatever milled rice (or 
unmilled paddy) it needs for supplementing the incomes of 
civil servants and the military.  Ministry of Agriculture and 
Irrigation (MOAI) officials tell us that the GOB, through the 
newly formed \"Myanmar Rice Trading Steering Committee,\" will 
play a role in setting this \"purchase price\" though it will 
be market-driven. 
 
3. (SBU) It is unclear how the regime will finance these new, 
more expensive purchases.  Even if the government buys 
cheaper paddy from merchants, the Ministry of Commerce\'s 
Myanmar Agriculture Produce and Trading (MAPT) company could 
face procurement costs as much as 40 billion kyat (roughly 
$40 million) higher than last year.  In the government\'s 
recently published budget, there is no increase reflected in 
expected expenditures for the Ministry of Commerce or MAPT. 
However, supplementary appropriations are legal and routine, 
and deficits, including the deficits of state economic 
enterprises like MAPT, are funded automatically by the 
Central Bank.  In short, if all else fails, there is always 
the printing press. 
 
4. (SBU) A high-ranking MOAI official agreed that MAPT would 
be on the hook for much larger procurement expenses than 
before, and that this issue would have to be monitored 
closely.  However, he pointed out that expanded production in 
the long run should drive down domestic prices, and thus 
MAPT\'s expenses.  Also, under the policy proposal the 
government is set to benefit richly from expected increases 
in rice exports.  The government already nets 10 percent from 
a tax on all exports, a practice that will continue. 
However, in this new export regime, traders will have to turn 
over 50 percent of after-tax foreign exchange earnings to the 
government, in exchange for 50 percent of the trader\'s 
documented kyat expenses, plus some \"acceptable,\" but yet 
undetermined, profit margin. 
 
5. (SBU) There is also the possibility that the government 
may choose to cover the cost of the new policy with new 
taxes, particularly on agriculture.  Up to now, the only 
significant taxes farmers paid in Burma were those implicit 
taxes applied through government procurement at below market 
prices.  With that procurement now ended, farmers should be 
fair game for new and more efficient taxes, particularly 
taxes on land.  Part of the proceeds from these taxes could 
be applied, if the government sees fit, to the cost of a rice 
subsidy. 
 
6. (SBU) Another option would be for the government to cut 
its rice subsidies to government employees (about 80 million 
baskets per year) and/or replace it with a salary increase. 
Rumors of such an increase have been floating around for 
several months.  However, this raise did not materialize with 
the commencement of the new fiscal year (April 1), and there 
is no hint from the budget numbers that such a huge increase 
in spending is in the cards.  Absolute cuts in the rice 
subsidy, meanwhile, are possible, but would be politically 
unlikely. 
 
No Credit, No Education, No Problem! 
 
7. (SBU) The serious question of credit was also not 
addressed in the GOB\'s policy proclamation.  Starting this 
monsoon crop cycle (June), farmers will not receive the 
advance procurement payments from MAPT that, while small, 
were the main source of credit for purchasing fertilizer, 
seeds, diesel fuel, and other inputs.  According to the MOAI 
official, this issue has not been resolved.  The banking 
sector will be little help, with private banks under water 
and the state-owned Myanmar Agricultural Development Bank 
lending a maximum of 5,000 kyat ($5) per acre.  MOAI and rice 
merchants forecast that farmers will muddle through by taking 
loans, at high interest rates, from the large informal 
financial sector and, ironically, by making advanced sales to 
consortia of rice merchants and to MAPT. 
 
8. (SBU) Similarly, the question of needed technology and 
education was left unresolved.  A Union of Myanmar Federation 
of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) official told 
us that his organization was working with FAO to establish 
some small training seminars for entrepreneurs and possible 
fact-finding trips to the newly liberalized rice markets of 
Vietnam and Cambodia.  However, he complained that the regime 
had made no mention of any new training programs or education 
above the existing, inadequate agricultural extension and 
research programs.  The MOAI Director General for Planning 
admitted that there had been no new money extended for 
training and education in the recent Ministry budget despite 
his division\'s regular requests.  However, his division and 
the Ministry were working informally to get whatever 
technical advice it could from Japan, South Korea, and from 
Burma\'s ASEAN neighbors. 
 
Why Now? 
 
9. (SBU) Perhaps only Than Shwe\'s astrologer knows for sure 
why the SPDC chose to introduce such a major new initiative 
just before planting began.  We believe the new policy had 
been building momentum for some time, influenced by intense 
lobbying from the UMFCCI and the MOAI, and a number of other 
factors.  First, domestic pressure on the government due to 
record high rice prices was making rice a political hot 
potato.  The transfer of responsibility to the private sector 
will give the GOB a scapegoat should the price of rice 
continue its upward climb.  Second, SPDC Senior General Than 
Shwe was reportedly much impressed during his recent visit to 
Vietnam by that country\'s success in liberalizing its rice 
exports, adding to the regime\'s comfort level in privatizing 
its own rice market.  Leaders here often return from abroad 
with \"good ideas\" that are announced and implemented with 
unusual alacrity. 
 
10. (SBU) Another factor that cannot be ignored is the 
influence of the work Japanese economic experts have been 
doing with their Burmese counterparts to put together a 
comprehensive economic structural reform roadmap.  High on 
the list of priorities is the need for agricultural reform, 
particularly of the rice sector.  According to a MOAI 
official, this advice had significant resonance among some 
Burmese government officials.  The Japanese ambassador to 
Burma agreed with this assessment, telling the COM recently 
that he thought Japan\'s agricultural recommendations had had 
a definite impact on the GOB\'s decision to open the rice 
market. 
 
Rice Liberalizations Good, But Not Enough 
 
11. (SBU) Traders are also questioning their ability to buy 
and sell on a country-wide basis.  Right now, military 
commanders in the countryside are under orders to maintain 
local self-sufficiency, and have powers to block trade across 
district lines if that self-sufficiency is threatened.  As a 
result, in late April in northern Shan state, the regional 
commander was posting signs forbidding any transfers of rice 
between districts in southern Kachin and northern Shan 
states, even as the new rice liberalization measures were 
being announced.  If the new rice marketing policies are to 
work properly, the government will have to not only free the 
trade, as it has, but also unify the market by curtailing the 
powers military commanders now have to limit commerce.  If 
that is not done, the free market policies will have, at 
most, only localized effects. 
 
12. (SBU) Likewise, rice liberalization cannot succeed in an 
economic policy vacuum.  Without complementary reforms (such 
as a reduction of price inflation and re-establishment of 
some functioning formal financial system), farmers and 
merchants will not be able to take full advantage of the 
benefits of a free rice market. 
 
Only the Beginning? 
 
13. (SBU) It\'s hard to know at this early stage whether rice 
liberalization is the vanguard of a host of agricultural 
reforms or just an isolated action.  Businessmen, rice 
merchants, foreign diplomats, and government officials are 
all in the dark.  We can hope, though, that the move on rice 
will give courage to those in the private sector and various 
ministries who have been pushing for fundamental agricultural 
and economic reform measures.  MOAI officials have told us 
they are going to push for a reform of the agriculture 
taxation system as soon as possible.  The Japanese government 
is trying to further bolster economic reformers by outlining 
clear objectives and strategies.  We too can assist by 
providing examples of U.S. \"best practices\" and offering 
whatever we can to the anemic, but burgeoning, private 
agricultural sector.

SUBJECT: ENERGY GIANTS FUND BURMESE MODEL VILLAGES 
 
REF: RANGOON 71 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: A visit to the Total/UNOCAL pipeline zone 
in Tanintharyi Division revealed an impressive level of 
socio-economic development.  A lack of government 
interference, and the determination of well-funded corporate 
citizens to push the envelope, have allowed for decent living 
standards, comparative religious freedom, and the development 
of nascent democratic institutions.  Considering these 
companies\' ambitious and progressive policies, and the GOB\'s 
apathy toward funding basic services, the significant 
potential we witnessed would certainly dwindle if the firms 
left.  End summary. 
 
Unprecedented Independence 
 
2. (SBU) COM, Pol Officer, Econ Officer, and PAO traveled 
with TotalFinaElf and UNOCAL (the \"partners\") representatives 
to the area surrounding their 63 km onshore gas pipeline in 
Burma\'s southernmost Tanintharyi Division.  The partners have 
established a corridor around the pipeline encompassing 23 
villages, the largest of which is Kanbauk, located about 150 
miles as the crow flies southeast of Rangoon.  Twenty of the 
villages are Burman majority, while the other three are 
Karen.  The partners have been allowed unprecedented 
independence in providing and managing development funds, 
with $1.2 million budgeted for 2003, for a total of $10 
million since the projects began in 1995, into these 
villages.  This has led to an undeniably superior level of 
economic and social development in the pipeline zone compared 
to other villages in the area and elsewhere in Burma (even in 
other \"model villages\" assisted by NGO or UN entities).  The 
whole zone had a strong, but positive, feel of a company 
town; organized, funded, and operated by the energy 
consortium. 
 
3. (U) The partners do not rely on INGOs or the government to 
carry out their projects.  Instead, they use their own local 
staff of 25 doctors, agronomists, safety experts, and 
teachers, as well as several dozen laborers for road 
maintenance. 
 
4. (SBU) The partners claim that the government keeps a very 
light hand on the 23 villages under the partners\' 
\"protection,\" providing only security for the area.  The 
military, which is the primary government entity in the area, 
allegedly leaves all of the economic enterprises alone and 
does not harass the schools or hospitals operated with the 
assistance of the partners.  Rare abuses by individual 
soldiers are reported to the partners via elected village 
councils and a complaint is passed on to the regional 
commanders.  According to Total, these few complaints have 
been resolved satisfactorily. 
 
5. (SBU) Though there is no way to completely verify the 
predictably rosy claims of the partners, there is no question 
that the economic and social standards of living for 
residents of the pipeline zone appear comparatively high. 
Further circumstantial evidence of a light GOB presence: in 
our travels, we saw only one or two soldiers, one small army 
base in Kanbauk, and one small USDA office tucked behind a 
well-stocked general store in Kanbauk. 
 
Economic Development: Opportunity and Access 
 
6. (SBU) The partners\' strategy for economic development in 
the pipeline zone has two elements: economic opportunity and 
infrastructure development.  The partners have been allowed 
to carry out both with the explicit and implicit approval of 
the government, but apparently with no interference. 
 
7. (U) The partners have provided numerous economic 
opportunities, mostly agricultural diversification and 
expansion projects.  In one case, using an agronomist hired 
away from the Ministry of Forestry, the partners built a 
nursery to grow 30,000-40,000 indigenous seedlings per year 
(mostly cashews, but also a wide range of other cash crops, 
such as black pepper, lime, rambutan, and durian) for 
distribution to local farmers.  Other economic development 
projects include pig and chicken breeding centers (complete 
with veterinarian and vaccination program) and a large 
pineapple and rubber plantation within which farmers are 
given deeds to plots after a probationary period. 
 
8. (SBU) On the infrastructure side the partners\' 
achievements are remarkable.  Without government 
interference, the partners have built a 63 km sealed road 
that tracks the pipeline (which is buried two meters 
underground).  They have also constructed numerous all-season 
dirt roads that branch off the main road into the villages 
being served.  We witnessed these roads being scrupulously 
maintained by staff and equipment provided by the partners. 
9. (SBU) Socio-economic infrastructure is encouraged through 
education and health assistance, as well as a rare 
micro-credit program.  The partners have been allowed to 
build and stock seven new clinics in various villages, and 
provide medicine, equipment, and personnel to the 
pre-existing government hospital in Kanbauk.  Aside from 
offering free treatment to villagers, the clinics focus on 
childhood vaccinations, family planning, and testing for and 
treatment of malaria, TB, and other endemic diseases. 
Likewise, the partners have been allowed to build and 
renovate 44 schools, provide learning materials, computers, 
and supplement the meager income of the 250 local government 
teachers (thus discouraging the supplemental \"tuition\" 
classes that most public school teachers across the country 
operate).  The partners have also been allowed to set up a 
private remedial tuition school aimed at those students who 
have failed their matriculation exams.  This latter project 
is most notable as the government is traditionally very 
reluctant to allow new private schools, and very heavy-handed 
on those that are permitted to exist. 
 
10. (U) Total\'s statistics show impressive results from these 
investments.  In education, Total indicates an 18 percent 
increase in enrollment since the 2000-01 school year.  In 
health, infant mortality is down 65 percent since 1997 (to a 
rate well below the national average), and mortality from 
malaria, water and foodborne diseases, and respiratory 
infections down 70 percent, 99 percent, and 90 percent 
respectively. 
 
11. (SBU) The micro-credit program is another important 
success, as banking laws generally make such schemes illegal 
in Burma.  Another exception is made for the UN, which 
carries out small micro-credit programs (using INGOs) in some 
areas in which it operates.  The partners admitted that 
they\'d never received explicit permission from the GOB to run 
this program; however, neither have government authorities 
interfered with the program (or tried to hijack funds) since 
its inception in 1997.  According to Total statistics, in 
2002 560 local people took loans (up to a maximum of $500) 
worth 25.2 million kyat (roughly $25,000 at current exchange 
rates).  The loans, which an elected village committee of 
four people, mostly teachers, distributes, are for a 6-month 
term, with interest due for 5 months at 2 percent per month. 
Since 1997, according to Total, there have been no defaults. 
 
12. (U) We saw one example of the micro-credit program at 
work.  A small businessman in a Karen village was putting the 
finishing touches on a small cashew nut processing \"factory.\" 
 When completed, the factory will employee eight women and 
produce roughly 150 kg of shelled cashews per day.  When 
producing at top capacity, the women will be paid about 
1000-2000 kyat ($1-$2) per day, a very generous paycheck when 
the average factory laborer earns about 500-1000 kyat per 
day.  More encouragingly, the owner had a rudimentary 
business plan, envisioning early sales to Dawei, the largest 
city nearby, and Kanbauk, then Rangoon, and hopefully someday 
for export over the nearby Thai border. 
 
Free Religion and Democracy in Burma? 
 
13. (SBU) The partners have also made surprising progress 
encouraging and developing democratic and religious 
institutions in the pipeline zone.  In one of the Karen 
villages, the partners funded the reconstruction of the 
village\'s 40-year old Baptist church.  The partners have 
built or renovated four other churches as well as two 
Buddhist pagodas.  Under the current regime, renovation or 
construction of new non-Buddhist religious buildings is not 
generally allowed; a complaint we\'ve heard loud and clear 
from the Christian community and one that resonates in 
Burma\'s annual religious freedom report. 
 
14. (SBU) The pipeline zone villages are also nurturing very 
primitive democratic institutions, again seemingly without 
government opposition.  The partners have worked with each 
village to establish elected \"Village Communication 
Committees\" (VCC) that liaise between the residents and the 
partners\' local representatives.  Though some of these 
Committees include the government\'s village Peace and 
Development Council designate, Total claims that these bodies 
operate freely and complain readily if there is government 
malfeasance.  As noted earlier, there is also a democratic 
element to the micro-credit program, which is run by a 
committee of four people, elected each year by the various 
VCCs.  Again, though this committee\'s membership is often 
mostly teachers (government employees), Total asserted that 
funds are not misdirected or misused. 
 
Little Things Mean A Lot, If the Environment is Ripe 
 
15. (SBU) At first glance, there are two key reasons for the 
success of the pipeline zone.  First, the partners\' programs 
can focus on the whole development picture, not just offering 
assistance but ensuring that locals have access to it.  We\'ve 
seen other similar economic development projects founder 
because of access problems.  Second, the partners, though 
consulting with GOB officials as necessary, are able to 
independently manage their ambitious and aggressive 
programming. 
 
16. (SBU) Another lesson learned is the ability, if there is 
a receptive environment, to do much with little in a country 
as starved for everything as Burma.  We define \"receptive 
environment\" as one which allows adequate political and 
managerial freedom by the implementing organization, and 
which has adequate transportation infrastructure.  If such an 
environment exists, $1 million-$2 million spread annually 
over a broad range of activities can have impressive success 
in improving living standards.  Without such an environment a 
program ten times as large will have only half the impact. 
Unfortunately at this time, as we\'ve reported (see reftel), 
the poor environment for aid in most of the country makes 
successes like UNOCAL-Total\'s a rarity. 
 
17. (SBU) One problem with the overall strategy is that much 
of it is not self-sustaining.  The extant small businesses 
and agricultural and breeding projects already underway would 
presumably continue to some degree.  However, the health 
clinics, schools, roads, livestock care, and micro-credit 
programs would likely deteriorate without the annual cash 
infusions from outside.  The partners are acting as a 
surrogate, and seemingly beneficent, government, so unless 
the GOB decides to start funding basic services and 
infrastructure (unlikely in the visible future), this is a 
problem if Total and/or UNOCAL pull out of Burma.  Should 
this occur, unless their successors have the same pressure 
from stockholders and human rights groups to \"do the right 
thing,\" the projects and programs funded by the partners 
might dissipate.

1. (U) Summary: After a month-long assessment, a UNODC 
mission told diplomats April 10 that \"opium production in 
Burma was plainly ending.\"  Northern Shan State, including 
areas controlled by cease-fire groups like the Kokang 
Chinese, was essentially clear of opium production.  However, 
farmers were paying the price for eradication.  Normally 
subsisting on incomes of less than $200/year, farmers and 
their families may starve this year. End Summary. 
 
\"The Era of Opium Cultivation in Burma is Ending\" 
 
2. (U) After a month-long assessment of the Wa Alternative 
Development Project in northeast Shan State, UNODC\'s 
assessment mission told diplomats, representatives of UN 
agencies, and INGOs April 10 that \"the era of opium 
cultivation in Burma is plainly ending.\"  According to the 
mission, opium cultivation had largely ended in northern Shan 
State.  This was true even in cease-fire areas that were 
previously centers of production.  Shan State Special Region 
1 in the Kokang, in particular, is completely clear of opium. 
 According to the assessment mission, cultivation continues 
in the territories controlled by the United Wa State Army, 
but even there cultivators are aware of the pending deadline 
fixed by the Wa authorities.  By the end of the 2004/05 
growing season, the Wa-controlled Special Region 2 is also 
scheduled to be opium-free. 
 
People May Starve 
 
3. (U) The downside of these developments, however, is a 
potential humanitarian catastrophe among the farmers 
dependent on growing opium for their income.  According to 
the mission, farmers in northern and eastern Shan State are 
already poor.  Yearly incomes run about $200/year, malaria is 
endemic, and child mortality rates (i.e., the number of 
children that die before the age of five) may run as high as 
35 percent, according to surveys done by INGOs.  Most 
critically, the region is deficit in food.  Farmers in the 
region have annually produced food sufficient to feed their 
families for only four to five months each year.  For the 
balance of the year, they fed their families with income from 
opium. 
 
4. (U) That income has now disappeared, and farmers have 
begun to move seeking work.  Wages, in turn, have collapsed. 
According to the mission, the wage for day labor in the 
Kokang has dropped sixty percent in recent months from 
approximately 10 Chinese yuan per day to only 4 yuan now (the 
equivalent of about 50 cents).  Meanwhile, some families have 
begun mortgaging property to meet current expenses; others 
have moved to larger cities like Kutkai, Lashio, and Laukai 
to beg.  Still others have begun to economize on 
non-essential expenditures, like education.  According to the 
mission, primary school attendance in the region has dropped 
60 percent in 2003. 
 
5. (U) The mission anticipates that this situation will grow 
rapidly worse both this year and in years to come.  Farmers 
in Shan State have not yet even begun to plant the monsoon 
rice crop, which will not be harvested until October. Between 
now and then, families will be left to cope on the basis of 
whatever resources they can find.  The crisis will also 
almost certainly expand as other regions go out of opium. 
The population of the Kokang region is only 200,000; the 
population of the Wa territories is 600,000 -- three times as 
large.  As those territories end opium production, the 
problems now evident in the Kokang and other areas of 
northern Shan State could multiply. 
 
 
Recommended Response 
 
6. (U) UNODC\'s assessment mission said that it is still 
working out the details of a proposed response, but 
anticipated that the cost of dealing with the consequences of 
opium eradication would overwhelm the resources of the GOB 
and of the cease-fire groups.  The entire budget of the 
Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, which ruled in the 
Kokang, was only 8 million yuan (i.e.; $1 million) per year. 
Similarly, while the Government of Burma claimed to have 
pumped over 40 billion kyat (about USD 40 million) in to the 
border regions over the past 14 years, this latest crisis was 
only one of several facing it.  Both might try to provide 
relief, but neither would be able to provide assistance on 
the scale required. 
 
7. (U) The mission said that it would recommend basically two 
programs: a 2-year program of humanitarian assistance and a 
15-year program of alternative development assistance that 
built on the experience gathered from the Wa Alternative 
Development Program.  It had not yet put a dollar value on 
the required assistance for either, but had at least 
developed a package of 3 proposed interventions for the 
emergency program and 20 proposed interventions for the first 
five years of the 15-year program.  Once complete, the 
15-year program would recommend a consolidation of project 
activities around Mong Pawk and an extension of those 
activites to areas in the Wa territories north of Pang Sang, 
and to the Kokang. 
 
Opposition Leaders Concerned 
 
8. (C) The UNODC mission\'s evaluation of the situation in 
northern Shan State was stark, but accurate.  Recently, 
opposition party members in Kutkai, Lashio, and Muse, 
including members of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s National League for 
Democracy, called Poloff\'s attention to the plight of farmers 
who were forced out of opium this year with little support 
from the government other than a sporadic distribution of 
seeds for alternative crops.  According to the political 
parties, there is risk of starvation in this area. 
 
9. (C) Secondly, what the team found in northern Shan State 
is only part of the story.  Much of the opium production in 
northern Shan state has been eliminated; some, however, has 
simply been pushed into other regions.  NLD members in Kachin 
State in particular complained of large new areas of opium 
production around Bhamo, and possibly as far north as the 
Tanaing Valley north of Myitkyina.  Similarly, UNODC reports 
that production in central Shan State from Keng Tung over to 
Taunggyi and Pinlaung has also increased this year, partially 
offsetting the decline in northern Shan State.  Overall, it 
appears that opium cultivation will be down substantially in 
Burma as a whole this year; however, progress has been 
uneven.  In some areas, like northern Shan State, opium has 
been virtually completely eradicated.  In others, more 
acreage is under opium cultivation than has been the case for 
some years. 
 
Comment 
 
10. (C) The fate of former opium farmers in Burma will depend 
on how well donor nations respond to UNODC\'s appeal for 
assistance for some of the poorest people in the world.  The 
Japanese have indicated that they do intend to be heavily 
involved in the Kokang.  The European Union has also lately 
decided to provide $1.8 million for two INGOs (Aide Medicale 
International and Maltheser) to work closely with UNODC on 
the provision of basic health services in the Wa territories. 
 However, more will be needed.  In October 2002 (reftel), 
UNODC put forward a proposed program of approximately $4 
million/year for alternative development in Burma.  That 
program may be scaled up now on the basis of the assessment 
report, but even so, the total scale of the program required 
in Burma will be modest when measured against the need or 
against the opportunity of shutting down one of world\'s 
traditional centers of opium production. End Comment.

SUBJECT: THIRTEEN YEARS ON, NLD CALLS ON JUNTA TO HONOR 
1990 ELECTIONS 
 
1. (U)  Summary:  At a ceremony honoring the 13th anniversary 
of multiparty elections in Burma, the National League for 
Democracy, which won 392 out of the 485 elected seats, called 
on the regime to honor the election\'s results.  Citing the 
junta\'s pledges from the pre- and post-election period that 
it would allow elected representatives to take office, the 
NLD lambasted the State Peace and Development Council for 
failing to honor these commitments.  NLD leader Aung San Suu 
Kyi did not attend the ceremony, as she continued a 
month-long visit to northern Burma.  Despite continuing junta 
harassment of her party and supporters along the route, large 
crowds have greeted her at every stop.  Finally, there were 
new arrests of political activists on May 19, while others 
arrested in February were released.  End Summary 
 
2. (SBU)  On May 27, at a crowded and sweltering ceremony at 
NLD headquarters, party representatives called on the SPDC to 
honor the results of multiparty elections held in 1990.  With 
electricity to the building cut off (purposely?), the 
temperature inside soared as well wishers, press, and 
representatives of other political parties crowded in to hear 
the proceedings.  Diplomats from the U.S., UK, Germany, 
France, Japan, and a smattering of UN agencies attended the 
event.  Conspicuously absent were any diplomats from ASEAN 
countries.  Speakers from the NLD and other parties held the 
SPDC to account for its failure to follow through on public 
statements over the years that it would return to the 
barracks and allow the elected officials to govern the 
country.  There were tributes to elected Members of 
Parliament who continue to press for recognition of the 
elections and, as a result, have sacrificed their freedom and 
the well being of their families.  Although 40-50 MPs-elect 
attended the event, a rumored larger turnout of MPs from 
around the country did not materialize. 
 
ASSK Still On the Road 
 
3. (U)  NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi, reportedly in Mandalay 
on her return from a trip to Kachin State, did not attend the 
ceremony.  Her traveling party and citizens hoping to see her 
have been harassed and intimidated at almost every location 
on the trip.  Large crowds of supporters have nonetheless 
turned out, ignoring authorities\' threats of retaliation. 
ASSK is expected to return to Rangoon on or about June 2, in 
anticipation of UN Special Envoy Razali\'s visit from June 
6-10. 
 
New Political Arrests and Releases 
 
4. (U)  Three NLD members, including one MP-elect, were 
reportedly arrested in Sagaing Division May 19 for discussing 
rice problems with local farmers.  The three were reportedly 
sentenced to 2 years in prison under a law dealing with 
public disturbances.  The MP-elect, U Win Myint Aung, was the 
first MP-elect since 1998 to receive a prison sentence 
(although many have been detained or put under house arrest). 
 The other two members were officers in the NLD Tabayin 
township office.  We have heard reports that six other NLD 
members may have been arrested in the same township, but no 
additional information is yet available. 
 
5. (SBU)  Late-May Foreign radio broadcasts report three 
members of the Arakan League for democracy were released 
April 6 - 12.  On May 20 the SPDC released Sai Nyunt Lwin, 
the Secretary General of the Shan Nationalities League for 
Democracy (SNLD) from Insein prison in Rangoon.  Sai Nyunt 
Lwin was arrested along with several NLD members on February 
8 for allegedly distributing democracy literature and for 
acts against the State.  Sai Nyunt Lwin turned state\'s 
witness and was not charged, while those he testified against 
received sentences ranging from five years to life.  Sai 
Nyunt Lwin reportedly claimed his testimony did not lead to 
the convictions as the others did not deny the charges 
against them.  He is being reinstated as the SNLD\'s Secretary 
General.  This episode has soured relations between the NLD 
and the SNLD, Burma\'s second largest party.  SNLD Chairman 
Hkun Htun Oo was noticeably absent from the May 27 elections 
ceremony at NLD headquarters.

SUBJECT: ROHINGYA PROJECT PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 85587 
 
1.  Summary: Embassy Rangoon would like to apply for a 
$20,000 grant from PRM\'s Ambassador\'s Fund for an assessment 
of communicable diseases among returning refugees in Burma\'s 
northern Rakhine State.  If done immediately, the assessment 
can provide the basis for a comprehensive health program in 
northern Rakhine State funded by the European Commission 
Humanitarian Aid Organization and/or the Federal Republic of 
Germany.  End Summary. 
 
2.  Embassy Rangoon would like to apply for a $20,000 grant 
from PRM\'s Ambassador\'s Fund for an initial assessment of 
communicable diseases in northern Rakhine State.  Northern 
Rakhine State is one of the least developed regions in Burma 
and has twice been the source for major refugee crises (in 
1978 and 1991), as Rohingya Muslim residents of the area fled 
increasing Burmese Army control and religious discrimination. 
 Most refugees (220,000 out of 240,000) have since returned 
to Burma, but conditions in northern Rakhine State make 
recurrence of a refugee crisis as likely as ever.  Health 
conditions are particularly bad.  Recent surveys indicate 
that 55 percent of the population of northern Rakhine State 
live under survival or critical conditions.  Access to 
essential health services is limited to urban settings, and 
the entire region is plagued by acute and chronic illnesses, 
associated with high mortality.  Infant mortality (death 
within the first year of life) is reported to be an 
astounding 141/1000 births.  Malaria, tuberculosis, and 
intestinal diseases are also rampant, aggravated by a high 
degree of malnutrition.  Tuberculosis is a particular 
problem.  According to one survey, 9 percent of all 
households in Northern Rakhine State have had at least one 
person ill with tuberculosis, and 67 percent of all persons 
surveyed recognized the disease as a major health concern. 
 
3.  Donor support for the population in the region, 
meanwhile, is limited and may decline further, if action is 
not taken now.  UNHCR, which has orchestrated relief 
operations in northern Rakhine State since 1994, is phasing 
out.  It is scheduled to end repatriation of refugees from 
Bangladesh at the end of 2003 and has hinted that it may 
close its operations in Burma altogether at the close of 
2004. 
 
3.  Our proposed project will help fill a gap in basic 
services for this threatened population.  It will do an 
assessment of the current situation in Northern Rakhine State 
in regard to communicable diseases and provide an initial 
package of basic support, pending development of an 
integrated health services project.  The implementing agency 
would be Malteser, a German INGO with extensive experience in 
completing health projects and assessments in third world 
nations.  In Burma, Malteser is already engaged in a $1.2 
million malaria control project in the Wa territories of 
northern Shan State, with funding from the European 
Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO). 
 
4.  We believe this is an excellent project.  If executed as 
outlined, it will lay the basis for a comprehensive health 
program among one of the most vulnerable popoulations in 
Burma.  It will also help protect that population from the 
neglect and abuse that might follow UNHCR\'s exit. In 
addition, it will facilitate a handoff of operations in 
Northern Rakhine State from UNHCR to agencies and INGOs with 
a longer development focus. 
 
5.  There are risks in the project.  The GOB has approved 
Malteser\'s survey in northern Rakhine State, but Malteser 
will need to negotiate an MOU with the Ministry of Health, 
before it can undertake  programs that go beyond the survey. 
In addition, funding for the follow-on comprehensive health 
program is not totally in place.  While Maltheser has 
received solid indications of support from both ECHO and the 
FRG, final commitments will only be made once the survey is 
completed and the need has been fully documented.  Finally, 
this project will be most effective, if it is done 
immediately, before the close of June 2003.  If the survey is 
delayed beyond that, it may not be possible to begin delivery 
of basic health services during the current rainy season. 
This is not necessarily a fatal problem, but it does put a 
premium on early approval of the project. 
 
7.  On balance, we believe the proposal merits funding. It\'s 
cheap; it promises to be effective, and it may catalyze donor 
funding for a population we care about for both humanitarian 
and human rights reasons.  It will also be executed by an 
excellent INGO with proven record of success.  Finally, as 
U.S. law requires, Maltheser\'s involvement will ensure that 
none of the funds pass to or through the government here. 
 
8. We have faxed a copy of the full proposal to PRM and will 
be happy to follow up on any questions PRM may have.

SUBJECT: NLD, GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS CLASH IN NORTHERN BURMA 
 
1. (C) Summary: The military junta may be preparing a new 
crackdown on Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for 
Democracy.  At a news conference May 31, the government 
accused the NLD of provoking a riot in Sagaing Division 
northwest of Mandalay that left four dead and more than 50 
injured. It also closed NLD headquarters and placed members 
of the NLD\'s Central Executive Committee under house arrest 
in Rangoon.  Aung San Suu Kyi herself, and senior members of 
her traveling party, have been held in Ye Oo in Sagaing 
Division, ostensibly for their own safety. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) At a press conference held May 31, the SPDC accused 
the NLD of provoking a riot on May 30 in Depeyin in Sagaing 
Division northwest of Mandalay.  According to the government, 
Aung San Suu Kyi\'s traveling party was met by a crowd of 
about 5,000 anti-NLD protesters as it reached Depeyin.  An 
argument broke out which degenerated into about a riot, 
leaving four dead and more than 50 wounded.  According to 
news reports (which we have not been able to confirm), Aung 
San Suu Kyi\'s car was also hit by gunfire.  She was not hurt, 
but was taken, together with 19 members of her traveling 
party, to Ye Oo in Sagaing Division (also northwest of 
Mandalay), where she was held, ostensibly for her own safety. 
In Rangoon, NLD headquarters was closed and members of the 
NLD\'s Central Executive Committee were placed under house 
arrest. Burmese police special branch members told Poloff on 
May 31 that both NLD spokesman U  Lwin and CEC member U Nyunt 
Wei have been detained under section 10(B) of Burma\'s Public 
Security Act, which allows the government to detain 
\'subversive elements\" for up to one year without a trial. 
Most likely, all other members of the NLD\'s Central Executive 
Committee have also been placed under house arrest. 
 
3. (U) Earlier in the day, the government\'s official 
newspaper, the Myanmar Alin carried stories on its front and 
back pages which accused the NLD of provoking disturbances in 
Chaung U and Mon Ywa in Burma\'s Sagaing division.  According 
to the newspaper, in Ye Bo San village and Mon Ywa, ASSK\'s 
party, reportedly about 150 people traveling in 16 cars and 
70 motorcycles, ended up in an altercation with \"peaceful 
protesters\" that left several injured and resulted in both 
sides filing charges at local police station.  According to 
the government, this followed clashes earlier in the month in 
Kachin State and Mandalay Division between NLD supporters and 
protesters. 
 
4. (U) As yet, the NLD has not yet been able to provide its 
version of these latest events.  Earlier in the week, 
however, the NLD\'s U Lwin had described the clashes in Kachin 
State and Mandalay Division as having been provoked by regime 
supporters, who physically threatened Aung San Suu Kyi and 
her party. 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C) We do not have the full story yet on the events in 
Sagaing, but this may be the beginning of a new government 
crackdown on the NLD.  There have been rumors in Rangoon for 
several days that June was to be the month in which the 
government brought the NLD to heel. The events in Sagaing may 
be the start of that campaign. End Comment.

Minister of Labor.  In company with Ambassadors from Germany 
and Italy and the British Charge, she also confirmed NLD 
Central Executive Committee members have been effectively 
placed under house arrest. She also visited NLD headquarters 
and confirmed that it had been closed and sealed by the 
regime.  Aung San Suu Kyi reportedly is returning to Rangoon, 
probably in police custody.  Reportedly special facilities 
are being constructed for her in Daukyant, on the outskirts 
of Rangoon, where she may be held once she returns.  We hope 
we are wrong, but it appears that the government is gearing 
up for a prolonged period of repression.  End Summary. 
 
Demarche Delivered 
 
2. (U) The Chief of Mission delivered reftel demarche in 
written form to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this 
afternoon.  Despite repeated attempts, she was not able to 
reach any MFA officials to deliver the points orally.  We 
will ask for meetings with Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung 
Win and Minister of Labor Tin Winn (the former Burmese 
Ambassador to the United States, who briefed reporters on the 
situation on Friday) to make the points in person on Monday. 
The British are doing a parallel demarche. 
 
NLD Offices Closed; Central Committee Members Under House 
Arrest 
 
3. (C) With the Ambassadors from Germany and Italy, and 
Britain\'s Charge\', the Chief of Mission attempted to call on 
NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe and NLD Spokesman U Lwin, but was 
turned away by Burmese police.   Nobody can enter or leave 
the CEC members\' houses, and all of their phones have been 
cut off, but the police refused to admit that that 
constituted house arrest (or protective custody.).  The 
Australian Charge\' was invited to accompany the group, but, 
surprisingly, was instructed by Canberra to stay away.  The 
Charge also confirmed that NLD headquarters has been closed 
and sealed by the government. 
 
Aung San Suu Kyi Returning to Rangoon 
 
4. (C) According to our police contacts, Aung San Suu Kyi is 
on her way back to Rangoon.  The government offered to fly 
her back, but she chose to return by car, spending the night 
of June 1 in Taungoo.  Most likely, she is traveling in 
police custody.  Reporters in Rangoon tell us that ASSK will 
be detained once she returns.  In fact, signals point to her 
being detained not in her own house, as on every previous 
occasion, but in special government facilities in Daukyant on 
the outskirts of Rangoon. 
 
Events in Depeyin 
 
5. (U) Meanwhile, the government press has provided 
additional details of the riot in Depeyin.  Apparently, a 
convoy of about 40 motorcycles and 9 cars that were 
accompanying ASSK were met by a crowd of about 5,000 anti-NLD 
protesters as they arrived in Depeyin northwest of Mandalay 
at 8 pm on May 30.  Fighting broke out when the NLD convoy 
attempted to break through the crowd.  One vehicle 
(apparently not from the NLD convoy) hit a tree, killing 
four.  Another vehicle (from the convoy) ran into a ditch.  A 
third (not belonging to the NLD convoy) was set on fire, 
allegedly by NLD supporters.  Altogether, four persons were 
killed and fifty wounded in the fighting and auto accidents. 
None of participants in ASSK\'s main party were hurt, however. 
 Early reports that her vehicle was hit by gunfire also 
appear to have been false. 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C) The situation is serious. The turmoil that has 
surrounded ASSK\'s latest trip has apparently alarmed the 
government.  In any case, while its statements have had a 
\"more in sorrow than anger\" tone, particularly in regard to 
Aung San Suu Kyi personally, its actions in placing the 
members of the NLD\'s Central Executive Committee under house 
arrest, in sealing the NLD\'s headquarters and township 
offices, and now possibly preparing special detention 
facilities for Aung San Suu Kyi, all suggest that we may be 
in for a prolonged bout of repression. 
 
6. (C) None of this bodes well for UN Special Envoy Razali\'s 
upcoming visit.  To judge from its recent actions, the 
government is done talking to the NLD.  Unless it relents, 
there is probably little point in a new visit by the UN Envoy.

Classified By: COM CMartinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  No one has yet claimed responsibility for 
the bombings in Tachileik on May 21, though the Burmese have 
blamed the Shan State Army (South) and the Thai blame the Wa. 
 The good news is that Thai and Burmese police officers are 
cooperating in the investigation, though it remains to be 
seen whether either side will turn up enough evidence to pin 
the case on the Wa, the Shan, or some other group.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) No one has yet claimed responsibility for four 
bombings which left four people dead (two civilians and two 
police) in the Thai/Burmese border town of Tachileik on May 
21.  According to Burmese police, the bombs went off at a 
police station, a gas station, a power plant, and a monument 
to King Bayinnaung, one of Burma\'s heroes in its wars with 
Thailand.  The Burmese have blamed Yawd Serk\'s Shan State 
Army (South), while Thai Deputy Prime Minister Chavalit has 
hinted that one faction of the Wa (led by United Wa State 
party Chairman Pauk Yu Chan\'s youngest brother, Pauk Yu Hwa) 
may be responsible.  However, no one appears to have enough 
hard evidence to pin blame on any particular group. 
 
3. (U) The attacks came at the end of a month-long series of 
bombings throughout Burma.  Since April 15, bombings have 
occured on a gas pipeline, in a cinema hall, at an 
archealogical site in Pagan and in Tachileik.  Altogether, 
the attacks have killed five and wounded more than fifty 
civilians.  In addition, the government has outlined about 20 
different incidents involving alleged assaults by Karen 
National Union and Shan State Army (South) troops on 
villagers in Karen and Shan States during the first four 
months of 2003.  These attacks and ambushes killed 33 people 
(including 4 monks) and wounded 42, according to the 
government. 
 
4. (U) The KNU has accepted responsibility for the pipeline 
bombings, but has denied involvement in any of the other 
incidents.  According to KNU General Secretary, Pado Man 
Shah, the gas pipeline is a legitimate military target.  The 
Shan State Army (South) has denied responsibility for all the 
attacks and has suggested that some of the attacks on 
villagers may have been carried out by Burmese Army soldiers 
dressed in SSA (South) uniforms. 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C) It will likely be some time before hard evidence is 
available to implicate one or another group in these recent 
bombings.  It seems clear, however, that both the SSA (South) 
and the KNU are moving towards unconventional tactics, out of 
desperation or in response to Thai government efforts to 
restrict their activities.  As Chavalit has suggested, 
narcotics may also play a role in the violence.  In any case, 
the good news is that the Burmese and the Thai police forces 
are apparently cooperating in the investigation of the attack 
in Tachileik.  The two sides may reach different conclusions, 
but at least they are sharing information, rather than 
trading accusations, as is usually the case.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The NLD has been effectively shut down in 
Burma.  Its offices have been closed and its senior leaders 
are under detention.  Aung San Suu Kyi has been brought back 
to Rangoon, ostensibly for \"her own protection,\"  but it is 
not clear yet where she is being held.  Universities, which 
were scheduled to re-open today for the new semester, have 
been kept closed by the government.  Reportedly, a curfew has 
been imposed in Mon Ywa in Sagaing Division in northwest 
Burma, but the situation is quiet in Rangoon, with no signs 
of additional security beyond a few additional MI 
surveillance teams.  End Summary. 
 
Aung San Suu Kyi 
 
2. (U) Aung San Suu Kyi has been brought back to Rangoon, but 
it is not clear where she is being held.  Speculation 
suggests that she may be either at Insein Prison, where 
special quarters were built for her during the late 1990s, or 
at the police camp in Htaukyant where NLD Vice Chairman U Tin 
Oo was held during his latest detention in 2000.  No 
diplomats or international press have seen ASSK since she was 
detained \"for her own protection\" on May 30.  We have been 
able to confirm that NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe and NLD 
spokesman U Lwin are under detention in their homes.  U 
Lwin\'s daughter told us today that U Lwin saw the Chief of 
Mission, the British Charge\' and the Italian and German 
Ambassador\'s, when they attempted to visit him on June 1, and 
appreciated the visit 
 
NLD Offices 
 
3. (U) All NLD state and township offices have been closed 
and sealed throughout Burma.  According to NLD party workers, 
none have been left open.  However, no NLD party workers 
beyond ASSK, the central committee members and those picked 
up in Depeyin have been detained. 
 
NLD Version of Events in Depeyin 
 
4. (C) Some NLD party workers have suggested that the riot in 
Depeyin was the result of a pre-planned government ambush. 
Supposedly, the NLD had received notice days before the riot 
that the government planned to stage an attack in Depeyin 
using convicts released from Mandalay Prison.  Reportedly, 
the tactics used by the rioters matched the reports received 
by the NLD. 
 
Universities and Secondary Schools 
 
5. (U) Most universities were advised last night that the 
next school semester will start June 16, rather than June 2. 
Today, only the medical colleges were open and operating. 
Secondary schools have also been closed for the month of 
June, though the government has attributed that closure, 
which was announced in late May, to a fear of SARS, rather 
than the recent political events. 
 
Curfews and Marshal law 
 
6. (U) Rangoon is quiet.  While military intelligence has put 
some additional surveillance teams on the street, presumably 
to check the public mood, there is no sign of increased 
security.  In the north, a curfew has reportedly been imposed 
in Mon Ywa, though we have not been able to confirm this as 
yet. 
 
Diplomatic Pressure 
 
7. (C) We sent a follow-up note to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs today asking for meetings with the Ministers of 
Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and Information to discuss the 
incidents in the north and ASSK\'s detention. (Copies of these 
notes have been faxed to EAP/BCLTV.)  As yet, the Ministry 
has not responded to our requests.  The Japanese Ambassador 
told us that his government had called in the Burmese DCM in 
Tokyo; similarly, the British called in the Burmese 
Ambassador in London. 
8. (C) The Japanese Ambassador has asked for meetings with 
Secretary 1, the Foreign Minister and the Home Minister, thus 
 
SIPDIS 
far without success.  The Home Minister, in fact, cancelled 
out of a dinner which the Japanese Ambassador had scheduled 
for June 1.  The Japanese Ambassador indicated that he 
intends to deliver a demarche which makes clear that the 
Japanese government \"cannot tolerate\" the detention of Aung 
San Suu Kyi and the closure of the NLD offices. 
 
Press Coverage 
 
9. (U) The official press has gone quiet on the clashes 
between NLD and regime supporters.  After two days of stories 
regarding the riot in Depeyin, there was nothing in Monday\'s 
official Burmese press.  However, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs announced late today that it will hold a briefing for 
diplomats tomorrow. 
 
Comment 
 
10. (C) The bottom line right now is that the NLD has been 
shut down.  Its offices have been closed and its senior 
leadership, including Aung San Suu Kyi, is under detention. 
The only question is how severe and how extended this new 
bout of repression will be.  So far, all the signs suggest 
that democratic forces in Burma may be in for long, hard 
period ahead.  End Summary.

1.  (C) After consultation with DOD DAS Jennings and other 
appropriate individuals involved in the W.W.II Remains 
Recovery Technical talks scheduled for June 4-6 in Rangoon, 
the mutual decision to postpone the talks was made today, 
June 2.  The most recent regime crackdown on the democratic 
opposition in Burma (reftels), has resulted in the detention 
of Aung San Suu Kyi and at least 10 senior members of her 
National League for Democracy under pretense of \"protective 
custody\" for their own safety.  This is an inappropriate 
setting for interaction between DOD elements and the military 
regime.  We have conveyed to DAS Jennings that Embassy 
Rangoon continues to fully support the W.W.II Remains 
Recovery Mission. 
 
2) (C) The talks were scheduled at this time to discuss 
operational details for a mission in December 2003 or January 
2004 (after the local rainy season) and can easily be 
rescheduled.  It was decided that it would be best to 
postpone the meeting rather than send conflicting signals to 
the Burmese government regarding our unhappiness with this 
latest round of political repression.  We are also concerned 
that the media or members of Congress could interpret 
technical talks at this time as DOD and State conducting 
\"business as usual\" with the regime at the same time that the 
USG is denouncing the junta\'s actions. 
 
3) (C) We have advised Major General Thein Shwe, of the 
Office of the Chief of Military Intelligence, of the 
postponement of the technical talks.  We informed him that it 
would be inappropriate to conduct the talks due to the 
current circumstances.  We reiterated our commitment to the 
recovery mission from a humanitarian perspective and told the 
general we would reopen discussions on the topic when 
appropriate.

SUBJECT: INSIDERS\' VIEWS ON HOW TO INFLUENCE BURMA\'S RULING 
GENERALS 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (S) Summary: Burma\'s businessmen have been telling us in 
no uncertain terms that neither economic sanctions nor 
constructive engagement will expedite political reform under 
the current circumstances.  With surprising unanimity, these 
insiders have asserted that \"coercive persuasion\" is the only 
possible solution.  End summary. 
 
An Informal Poll of Movers and Shakers 
 
2. (S) In light of the increasing intransigence of the regime 
in general, we\'ve been listening closely to our most reliable 
private sector contacts who work closely with the regime, on 
how to influence the political process.  We pass on these 
views not as a policy prescription, but to add to the ongoing 
debate, sparked by UN Envoy Razali during the February 
Informal Consultative Group (ICG) meetings in Tokyo, over how 
to better advance the process of transition in Burma. 
 
3. (S) Some of our sources are former military officers, both 
recently retired and of the Ne Win era, now using their close 
contacts still in service and in the government to advance 
their economic careers.  Others are long-standing private 
businessmen, both Burmese and foreign, who, manipulating 
close ties with ministers, military intelligence, and others 
in power, have learned the ropes and are now living high on 
the hog.  Despite their success, some of the sources are 
growing disenchanted with the regime\'s mismanagement of the 
economy and the country.  Others view each GOB economic 
misstep as something on which to capitalize for increased 
profits.  None expressed any particular love for ASSK or the 
NLD leadership, often citing their advancing age and 
inability to express a clear policy vision.  However, most 
agreed that there was currently not any other option. 
 
4. (S) The results of our soundings were surprisingly 
unanimous: to expedite political change, economic sanctions 
don\'t work, but neither would pure constructive engagement. 
The results of sanctions -- as measured by changes in the 
regime\'s behavior and achievement of U.S. policy aims -- have 
been quite limited.  According to the observers, the failure 
is due the sanctions\' inability to hit the ruling generals 
\"where they live,\" that is by threatening directly their hold 
on power. 
 
Economic Sanctions: Laughed Off 
 
5. (S) Our contacts told us that economic sanctions have 
missed their target for three main reasons.  First and 
foremost, unilateral sanctions cannot succeed.  U.S. 
sanctions have failed because of the inability to win 
multilateral cooperation, particularly from regional states. 
In the past several years, the Burmese government has worked 
hard and successfully to spin a cocoon of economic protection 
by strengthening trade, investment, and other ties with its 
neighbors.  The net result is that Burma now has friendly 
relations with all its neighbors.  This includes even 
democracies like India, Thailand, and Bangladesh, which 
continue to support, at least verbally, political transition 
in Burma.  For all of these neighbors, Burma simply holds too 
many of the keys to regional security and development to be 
sanctioned, embargoed, or isolated.  Even such anti-regime 
stalwarts such as the UK and the Nordic countries have 
started expanding their aid programs in Burma, though for 
reasons entirely different than those of the regional states. 
 While regional states are all focused on their basic 
political and economic interests in Burma, for the Europeans 
the growing humanitarian crisis has become an issue that 
parallels their interest in political transition. 
Businessmen are confident that should the United States 
impose a trade ban, the regime would shrug it off, benefiting 
as they do, both legally and illegally, far more from massive 
border trade with Thailand and China than from the minuscule 
amounts shaved off exports of garments and seafood to the 
United States. 
 
6. (S) A second factor is that sanctions have been 
politically useful to the regime, providing cover for its 
economic failures.  The regime is certainly vexed by 
reductions in foreign exchange earnings, whatever the cause, 
however the GOB\'s own policies are more to blame for these 
problems than any economic measures taken by foreign states. 
Evidence of this is the mass divestments of companies from 
all over the world, regardless of their home government\'s 
Burma policy. 
 
7. (S) Third, all of our contacts pointed out that, as they 
saw it, the government has nothing to win and everything to 
lose by making major concessions in the current environment. 
With this view of life or death, it\'s no surprise that the 
regime is able to easily weather the slight discomfort caused 
by unilateral U.S. sanctions. 
 
Constructive Engagement? 
 
8. (S) So what will work?  Most agreed that the regime might 
respond to carrots for non-political reforms.  However, the 
carrot would have to be sizable and clearly stated -- such as 
a large aid package or agreement to support an international 
financial institution effort to fund economic reforms -- and 
tied to specific reforms.  The consensus was clear that the 
regime would not be willing to take carrots, no matter the 
size, in exchange for major political reforms.  Even with the 
promise of money the rulers of Burma had little to gain, and 
much to lose, by agreeing to changes in the power structure. 
 
Coercive Persuasion 
 
9. (S) Our discussions always turned to the projection of 
force.  Contacts of various political stripes concurred that 
the only way to convince the senior generals to cede power 
was through \"coercive persuasion,\" that is wielding a large 
stick aimed directly at the heart of the leadership.  Time 
and again, we heard the assertion that this regime 
understands only the language of force, and would be 
influenced only if it is convinced it has more to lose 
personally from holding out than from coming to the table. 
The most important point, though, is that any coercive 
persuasion would need to be explicit and serious, and come 
with a firm timetable and deadline.  The regime, with its 
large cushion of regional relations and its experience facing 
down external pressure, would not respond to bluffs and vague 
gestures. 
 
10. (S) Despite our contacts\' strong views, none could give a 
clear example of how this kind of pressure has been 
successfully applied to the top leadership.  They explained 
their conviction in the Burmese cultural context, where even 
powerful men grudgingly do what they\'re told because someone 
more powerful extends an unrefusable offer.  No one would be 
specific on what the most useful stick for the current junta 
should be.  However, through a mix of allegories, metaphors, 
and obfuscation each implied that the only solution would be 
a direct challenge to the junta, possibly including force, if 
it did not agree to negotiate.  There was consensus that the 
regime would respond better to this stick if it were mixed 
with tangible carrots (help to relocate, guarantees of 
protection from revenge or prosecution, economic assistance, 
etc.) 
 
The Silent, Quaking Majority 
 
11. (S) Another common theme we\'ve heard is the existence, 
but inaccessibility, of a silent majority of high ranking 
military officers and civilian administrators who are unhappy 
with the current regime.  During the February ICG meetings, a 
hypothetical approach to reform minded \"Officer(s) X\" was 
debated as a possible alternative policy direction.  One of 
our contacts, who was a decorated army officer, said that 
many of the active duty officers from his \"batch\" (now 
colonels and brigadiers) and high-ranking civil government 
employees (including some Ministers) with whom he socializes, 
have expressed quiet but serious discontent with the regime. 
This sentiment stems largely from the SPDC\'s heavy handed 
management style, and the insecurity in which the ruling 
class must live its life.  Also, we\'ve heard from former and 
serving military contacts alike that officers feel that the 
regime is not taking adequate care of the troops, but instead 
spending vast sums on literal and figurative white elephants. 
 The ruling junta\'s evident recent decision to reduce 
expected salary raises to military officers and enlisted men 
only adds to this discontent. 
12. (S) The contact opined, though, that this discontented 
group is likely unreachable because while it dislikes aspects 
of the current system, it is enslaved to it.  First, though 
disenchanted, this group is unwilling to make sacrifices for 
the good of the country.  These officials owe their power and 
wealth to the current rulers, and thus are unwilling to take 
any anti-regime initiative that could lead to disaster for 
them and their families.  The second reason, according to our 
source, is that none of these officers and civilian officials 
has reached their positions of power and influence without 
accumulating some skeletons in their closets.  Thus, they, 
like the top leadership, are fearful that working for a 
change to the system (no matter how despised) could lead to 
prosecution or revenge on them or their families from any new 
civilian government. 
 
Comment 
13. (S) There are a few important caveats to note when 
considering the conclusions of these observers.  First, 
despite our contacts\' clear hinting that a military solution 
would be the most effective, such an adventure would be of 
questionable interest to the USG.  For obvious reasons, the 
risks of a military expedition on the borders of China, and 
at the juncture of two nuclear-armed states (China and India) 
would probably outweigh possible rewards.  Second, many 
educated Burmese these days are grasping at the idea of U.S. 
military action as a tidy solution to intractable and complex 
political problems.  However, our sources assert that they 
supported direct action long before the U.S. campaign in 
Iraq.  Third, it is difficult to completely write off the 
potential for other policies working to effect change here. 
While neither sanctions nor constructive engagement has been 
totally successful, neither has ever really been tried in a 
coordinated fashion by the entire international community.

1. (C) Summary: Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win\'s 
briefing for diplomats on the recent deadly clash between NLD

he provided a faithful rehash of government press reporting 
on the incident, he would not say where Aung San Suu Kyi or 
other members of the NLD leadership are being held or why NLD 
offices in Rangoon had been closed.  He could only assure 
diplomats that both measures were \"temporary\" and that 
neither Aung San Suu Kyi or any of the members of the NLD 
leadership had been charged with any crime.  On Razali, he 
said it was up to the Special Envoy to decide whether he came 
to Burma June 6 as planned, but noted that he could not 
guarantee that Razali would see Aung San Suu Kyi, if he came. 
 Razali may be willing to continue his mission on those 
terms, but we don\'t see the point. So long as she remains in 
detention and the NLD offices remain closed, Razali should 
stay away. In the meanwhile, we plan to send officers to 
Depeyin to see what we can determine regarding events there. 
It may be impossible to re-assemble any clear picture of 
events on May 31, but we believe it is essential to show our 
interest and concern.  End Summary. 
 
The Government\'s Briefing 
 
2. (U) At a briefing for diplomats on June 3, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Khin Maung Win provided a rehash of the government\'s 
side of the story regarding the recent riot in Depeyin. 
According to the Minister, the events in Depeyin were 
provoked by the youth wing of the NLD and militant Buddhist 
monks who had affiliated themselves with the NLD.  He said 
that there had been a variety of incidents leading up to the 
riot on May 31.  He asserted that a 21-year old girl had been 
run down in Shwebo and, in Indaw on May 26, NLD supporters 
had attacked villagers with \"sticks, iron pipes and bicycle 
chains.\"  In Depeyin on May 31, the NLD convoy, consisting of 
nine cars and about 40 motorcycles, were stopped by a crowd 
of 5,000 local people about 2 miles outside the town, he 
said.  As the NLD tried to push its way through the crowd, 
fights broke which eventually left four dead and fifty 
hospitalized.  Initially, there were \"no Burmese police or 
military forces\" on the spot, according to the DepFonMin. 
Security forces from Mon Ywa only arrived about two hours 
after the altercation started.  They secured the situation, 
took Aung San Suu Kyi and her party into \"protective 
custody\", and took count of the casualties.  The government 
still has not identified all the dead, missing, or injured, 
but says categorically that neither Aung San Suu Kyi nor NLD 
Vice Chairman U Tin Oo were injured. The DepFonMin also 
denied that gunshots were fired during the course of the 
incident. 
 
3. (U) On Aung San Suu Kyi, the Minister said that the 
government had been obliged to  provide \"temporary 
protection\" for her and her party.  Similarly, the NLD had 
been asked to \"temporarily\" close their offices throughout 
the country.  The DepFonMin asserted that the government had 
\"no animosity or hostility\" towards Aung San Suu Kyi, and 
maintained that, for the government, the \"greatest nightmare\" 
is that some harm might come to her.  However, some of the 
NLD youth had acted \"very rashly,\" and there was \"growing 
resentment\" against the NLD in Burma.  He also assured 
diplomats that the process of national reconciliation would 
continue and hoped \"that the international community will 
understand the situation and not complicate it.\" 
 
Diplomats Reaction 
 
4. (U) Diplomats reacted to brief with incredulity and tough 
questions that focused on Aung San Suu Kyi\'s health and 
circumstances, the situation of the NLD\'s Central Committee 
members, and the government\'s reasons for closing NLD offices 
throughout Burma.  The DepFonMin would not say where Aung San 
Suu Kyi was being held, though he did say she was not in the 
notorious Insein prison.  He also said that neither she nor 
any of the other leaders of the NLD would be charged with any 
crime.  When pressed regarding access to ASSK and the other 
NLD detainees by the COM, the British Charge, and the French, 
German and Norwegian Ambassadors, however, he stated flatly 
that \"for security reasons,\" it would not be possible for any 
diplomats to have access to either Aung San Suu Kyi or any of 
the other members of the NLD\'s leadership and gave no time 
frame for the \"temporary\" detention.  His answer regarding 
the NLD\'s offices was much the same; the offices had been 
closed down as a \"temporary measure for security reasons.\" 
On SE Razali\'s upcoming visit, the DepFonMin said that he had 
been in touch with the Special Envoy on both June 2 and June 
3 but it was entirely up to Razali as to whether he came or 
not.  However, he emphasized that at \"his level\" (the 
DepFonMin\'s) he could not assure Razali that he could meet 
with Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 
5. (U)  The DepFonMin also ruled out any international 
investigation of the incident.  Burma, he said, was \"very 
conscious of its independence\" and would never allow 
foreigners to dictate to it.  When the COM informed the 
DepFonMin that officers form the Embassy were traveling to 
Depeyin on June 4, he was taken off guard, but did not 
indicate that the area would be off limits to travel. 
 
6. (U) The DepFonMin\'s answers satisfied no one.  The COM was 
emphatic in stating that the GOB\'s credibility on this matter 
was gone, and that the diplomatic community could not be sure 
whether Aung San Suu Kyi and the other NLD members were alive 
or dead.  Without access, no one could verify any part of the 
government\'s story. She also questioned the credibility of 
the government\'s account of the events in Depeyin and 
insisted that names of the dead should be released.  The 
British noted that, in large measure, the GOB\'s own 
credibility and reputation was at stake - if we could not 
verify the government\'s statements, others would undoubtedly 
question them.  The Italian Ambassador similarly expressed 
his concern and that of the EU regarding the situation and 
read a statement from the EU. 
 
Comment 
 
7. (C) This was a deservedly brutal session for Khin Maung 
Win.  His account convinced no one.  In fact, his 
presentation left behind the impression that the government 
have stage-managed recent events in order to end the latest 
tentative political liberalization episode in Burma, and to 
scuttle the UN-sponsored dialogue process.  It is hard 
otherwise to understand how Aung San Suu Kyi\'s party could 
have run into a mob of 5,000 anti-NLD agitators at night on a 
country road without any government security present.  The 
government\'s actions since then in closing all NLD offices 
and holding all senior NLD leadership incommunicado also 
suggest that the government has a broader agenda than simply 
assuring internal security.  Burmese government spokesmen 
will deny this, as the DepFonMin did in the briefing today, 
but the government\'s seeming indifference to the strong 
international reaction to the latest events, and to Razali\'s 
mission, suggests that neither political transition nor 
international opinion carries any weight with them at the 
moment.  Internal security and keeping the junta\'s power 
intact comes first, even if that means political repression 
and international condemnation. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT:  For the United States and other countries 
which have focused their policy on the goal of a transition 
to democracy and increased respect for human rights and the 
rule of law, these latest developments are powerfully 
negative.  The GOB may restore ASSK\'s liberty and may allow 
the NLD to re-open its offices, but there is little doubt 
that it will do so only on terms that make explicit that 
political liberty will always be subordinate to the internal 
security concerns of the regime in Burma.  Razali may be 
willing to continue his mission on those terms, but we don\'t 
see the point, unless there is some clarification of the 
government\'s intention regarding the teatment and liberties 
of the NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi.  So long as she remains in 
detention and the NLD offices remain closed, Razali should 
stay away.  End Comment. 
9. (U) We are sending two officers and an FSN employee to 
Depeyin to see what we can determine on the ground regarding 
events there.  It may be impossible to re-assemble any clear 
picture of events on May 31, but we believe it is essential 
to show our interest and concern.

to Than Shwe and not fold as he did last time.  It is time 
for tough talk, not soft words and ASEAN-style diplomacy. 
This needs to be conveyed to the Special Envoy in a very 
clear and forthright manner.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Post continues in its conviction (in line with 
Department, Ref A) that Special Envoy (SE) Razali should not 
come to Rangoon absent firm assurances that he will be 
allowed a meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi.  However, we 
understand that the SE is still undecided (Ref B) as to his 
course of action and may be considering the scenario outlined 
in para 2, Ref C - coming to Rangoon even if the regime holds 
firm on no ASSK contact.  In this hypothetical scenario 
Razali would arrive June 6 and present a formal request to 
see ASSK.  If the SPDC refuses his request, Razali would 
leave Rangoon immediately, making public the reasons for his 
early departure.  Granted, this might allow the SE more 
options and keep the regime from claiming that Razali, not 
the GOB, had scuttled the visit. 
 
3. (C) The question mark in this hypothetical scenario is 
Razali\'s resolve in the face of senior general Than Shwe\'s 
intransigent dictatorial style.  It should be remembered that 
on Razali\'s last visit in November 2002, he complied with 
Than Shwe\'s demands that the SE not go to Shan State to meet 
with ASSK on one of her political trips.  It should also be 
recalled that Than Shwe gave the SE a paltry 10-15 minutes of 
his time on the last visit, and there is no indication that 
there will be a more substantive meeting, or any meeting at 
all, this time. 
 
4. (C) In addition, Razali\'s mentor Prime Minister Mahatir 
steps down in October 2003 and Razali\'s influence will wane 
in proportion (I posited this idea to the Malaysian 
Ambassador in a meeting with other ASEAN and EU ambassador\'s 
- he agreed that Razali\'s clout is tied to his mentor\'s 
status as Prime Minister).  As Razali has maintained his 
business ties to the regime (his company has the contract for 
the new Burmese passports), and Mahatir\'s clout will be 
waning with the regime, Razali will be wary of really 
confronting Than Shwe and leaving in a manner that would burn 
his bridges behind him. 
 
5. (C) Comment:  If Razali chooses to come without guarantees 
of any kind (the regime has said quite publicly \"it is up to 
him\"), then he needs to know that he is expected to stand up 
to Than Shwe and not fold as he did last time (and as PM 
Mahatir did in August of 2002 when he cancelled his visit to 
ASSK because he \"wanted to be a good guest\").  The 
discouraging developments of the past week have changed the 
focus of the Special Envoy\'s role from that of facilitating a 
political dialogue to making Than Shwe give tangible proof of 
the regime\'s oft-stated commitment to national 
reconciliation.  It is time for tough talk, not soft words 
and ASEAN-style diplomacy.  This needs to be conveyed to the 
Special Envoy in a very clear and forthright manner.  End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: UNFPA\'S BURMA SCORECARD IS GOOD, SO FAR 
 
REF: STATE 137010 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: UNFPA, into the second year of its 
four-year \"special program\" in Burma, is encouraged by its 
successes.  To help ensure further progress, though, the 
agency\'s Rangoon office hopes that a chronic shortage of 
contraceptives will be remedied in short order.  The agency 
plans to expand both the width and depth of its program in 
the next two years, continuing to work with local and 
international NGOs, other UN agencies, and the Burmese 
government.  UNFPA\'s programs address serious health and 
social needs in Burma, and thus expansion will benefit many 
underserved women and adolescents.  However, we\'ll keep an 
eye on two potential pitfalls of expansion: a deterioration 
in monitoring, and an expansion in leakages.  End summary. 
 
UNFPA Spreads its Wings in Burma 
 
2. (U) The UNFPA established itself well in the first year of 
its program in Burma.  Though UNFPA has worked in Burma since 
1969, it only established a country office in the summer of 
2002.  UNFPA\'s representation in Burma was raised in 2003 
from chief of operations to representative level.  Currently 
UNFPA is into the second year of its $16 million, four-year 
program. 
 
3. (U) UNFPA\'s programs in Burma address behavior change, 
adolescent reproductive health, and general reproductive 
health services.  It generally tries to build the capacity of 
the decrepit rural healthcare network of health centers and 
sub-centers by providing resources and training.  On the 
population side, UNFPA continues its work analyzing the 
numbers from a 2001 fertility and reproductive health survey 
it carried out with the Burmese government.  UNFPA recently 
took over the responsibility, normally held by UNICEF, to 
provide drugs for people with sexually transmitted diseases. 
The agency is also involved in HIV/AIDS education and 
prevention as part of the UN country team\'s Expanded Theme 
Group on HIV/AIDS, and is awaiting Ministry of Health 
approval to begin its own HIV/AIDS programming -- centered on 
education and \"100 percent condom usage.\" 
 
Maternal Mortality is the Key Problem, Focus 
 
4. (SBU) There\'s no question that UNFPA\'s mission to address 
maternal mortality tracks with the country\'s needs.  In 1997, 
the maternal mortality rate in Burma was about 255 per 
100,000 live births.  Raw statistics collected at the end of 
2001 indicate that the rate has increased since then. 
 
5. (U) There\'s also strong evidence of demand for UNFPA\'s 
activities, both education and contraceptive supplies. UNFPA 
estimates that only 29 percent of married women of 
reproductive age use contraceptives.  In its operating area, 
UNFPA is only able to supply 12-15 percent of likely clients. 
 Consequently, urban women avail themselves of a booming 
black market for counterfeit, expired, or uncertified 
contraceptive devices brought over from China.  In rural 
areas, UN agencies, NGOs, and other commentators tell us, 
women turn to illegal abortions as a contraceptive measure. 
 
6. (U) Additionally, UNFPA, along with various INGOs, helps 
fills a niche for contraceptive choice.  Though the 
government has focused on 100 percent condom distribution as 
part of its HIV/AIDS program, there\'s not been much attention 
on other modes of contraception. 
 
7. (U) Through its training programs, aimed at the vastly 
female rural health corps and health statisticians, UNFPA 
helps build capacity among female caregivers and 
administrators. 
 
Relations with NGOs, Donors, and the Government 
 
8. (U) UNFPA carries out its work in conjunction with rural 
government health workers, other UN agencies (especially the 
WHO), international NGOs, and local government-controlled 
NGOs (including the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare 
Association and the Myanmar Medical Association).  UNFPA\'s 
condom distribution is contracted to PSI, with which U.S. AID 
works closely to implement its nascent $1 million HIV/AIDS 
program in Burma.  Other partner INGOs include Marie Stopes 
International, the International Planned Parenthood 
Federation, and the Japanese Organization for International 
Cooperation in Family Planning.  Save the Children and World 
Vision also provide reproductive health services here, but 
are not currently affiliated with UNFPA. 
 
9. (SBU) The INGOs with whom we spoke were generally positive 
about UNFPA\'s operations here.  Some were a bit critical of 
UNFPA\'s, and all UN agencies\', dealing with the regime and 
government NGOs.  However, they admitted that the UN had 
little choice but to work with the government to some degree, 
and UNFPA was more vigilant than others in minimizing GOB 
interference. 
 
10. (U) UNFPA\'s usual bilateral donors (the Netherlands and 
the Scandinavian countries) are not active in reproductive 
health in Burma, having put their limited Burma assistance 
funds into the fight against HIV/AIDS.  However, the Japanese 
government is doing some work on reproductive health.  UNFPA 
receives some limited grassroots funding from the Japanese 
Embassy in Rangoon for renovating rural health clinics.  We 
were told that Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) 
was planning a $2-$3 million multi-year program to provide 
reproductive health alongside UNFPA in several dozen 
townships. 
 
11. (SBU) UNFPA\'s relations with its two government 
interlocutors, the Ministry of Population and Immigration 
(MOPI) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), are generally good. 
UNFPA\'s representative reports that MOPI has been 
surprisingly helpful and efficient in collaborating to 
improve population statistics (there\'s been no official 
census taken since the one UNFPA helped organize in 1983). 
The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been somewhat more 
bureaucratic and slow -- a complaint heard from many UN 
agencies and health INGOs.  However, the UNFPA representative 
reported that under the new Health Minister, Dr. Kyaw Myint, 
cooperation and efficiency have increased.  For example, 
Minister Kyaw Myint responded rapidly to UNFPA\'s request to 
establish 20 new clinics/information centers/social halls 
aimed at adolescents.  This proposal had languished for 
months under the previous minister. 
 
12. (SBU) Though UNFPA does not channel its funds through the 
MOH or other government ministries, it does work directly 
with local health officials and government-run clinics.  It 
also relies on the MOH\'s central distribution network to get 
contraceptive devices sent to the various townships.  The 
UNFPA representative complained that this distribution 
network is slow and inefficient, but that there is no other 
alternative if the GOB is to allow UNFPA to continue its 
operations. 
 
Future Plans are Ambitious 
 
13. (SBU) Aside from the hoped-for HIV/AIDS program, UNFPA 
intends to expand its capacity-building work.  The Rangoon 
office intends to bring in consultants in 2003 to conduct a 
thorough gender analysis.  In part, the impetus for this 
study is the evolving economic role for women in Burma, as 
more and more men seek economic opportunities outside the 
country.  Following up this study, UNFPA, alongside the 
Myanmar National Working Committee for Women\'s Affairs, plans 
to do several workshops on gender issues and trafficking in 
persons aimed at male policymakers at all levels of 
government. 
 
14. (SBU) Though it is limited by its MOU with the government 
to reproductive health, UNFPA is also examining a pilot 
project to work with the UN Interagency Project to Combat 
Human Trafficking in the Mekong Sub-Region\'s (UNIAP) 
expanding Burma operations.  Specifically, UNFPA is looking 
to assist a small, local development group (headed by 
Catholic and Buddhist nuns) in Mon State to provide small 
loans and other assistance to women and girls who might 
otherwise seek a more dangerous living over the border in 
Thailand. 
Problems and Obstacles Remain 
 
15. (SBU) UNFPA\'s small operation in Burma allows it to exist 
with fewer obstacles than other, larger UN agencies. 
However, there are three issues worth watching.  First, a 
major problem faced by UNFPA in Burma is a lack of funding 
for contraceptive supplies.  Though condoms are not a 
problem, procurement of contraceptive pills, injections, 
IUDs, and the \"morning after\" pill has been inadequate.  The 
representative said that UNFPA\'s procurement for Burma is 
$800,000 in the hole for 2003, in large part due to a drop 
off of bilateral donations and a general reduction of UNFPA\'s 
funding around the world. 
16. (SBU) Exacerbating this problem is leakage and government 
misuse of what contraceptive supplies UNFPA can bring into 
the country.  That being said, at this point leakage of 
contraceptives for resale into the black market is not as 
large a problem as it is for drugs and other high-value 
items.  There are allegations that the government hijacks 
some supplies of condoms, in particular, for their own use, 
or for \"donation\" to a government-controlled NGO.  However, 
the seriousness of this problem is unclear. 
 
17. (SBU) Monitoring, always a difficult task in Burma, is 
easier for UNFPA because of the small size of its program. 
Currently the agency is operating in 84 townships (about 25 
percent of the country\'s total), mostly in more heavily 
populated rural areas that have better transportation 
infrastructure.  Thus it is easier for UNFPA staff to make 
regular monitoring missions.  The representative said that he 
or his staff are making about four monitoring trips per month 
to various program sites.  However, UNFPA aims to expand to 
100 townships by 2005, which could put a strain on monitoring 
effectiveness without additional hiring.

REF: RANGOON 664 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  Late on June 7, Special Envoy Razali 
briefed COM Martinez on his meeting earlier in the day with 
SPDC Secretary One Khin Nyunt.  Khin Nyunt told Razali that 
the crackdown on the NLD was in response to actions by ASSK 
that constituted an unacceptable threat to the SPDC.  He 
assured Razali that ASSK was in good health and provided two 
photos dated May 31 to prove it.  Razali said he did not 
contest Khin Nyunt\'s justification for the crackdown, 
choosing instead to make the case that it was absolutely 
essential that he gain access to her on this visit.  Khin 
Nyunt said this was not his decision to make and asked for 
Razali to make the case for access to ASSK directly to Vice 
Senior General Maung Aye in a meeting early Monday.  The SE 
is well aware that this may just be a ploy to wear out his 
patience so he will leave and the SPDC can claim that he 
\"quit.\"  Razali is determined to go the last mile and see 
Maung Aye, although he did not seem hopeful of the outcome. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C)  Special Envoy Razali and his team (Hitoki Den, Damon 
Bristow, and Leon DeReidmatten) met with COM Martinez on June 
7 to provide a read-out of his meeting earlier in the day 
with SPDC Secretary One General Khin Nyunt.  In what he 
termed \"a long session\" with Khin Nyunt, Razali said he made 
a strong case for access to Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK), saying, 
among other things, that it would be an embarrassment to 
ASEAN to not allow the Special Envoy access.  Razali said 
Khin Nyunt responded with a long explanation of the SPDC\'s 
perception that ASSK posed an unacceptable threat to the 
state based on her recent actions.  Khin Nyunt provided 
photos of crowds that have gathered to hear ASSK at various 
stops and said she had begun to deviate from the agreement 
she had with the SPDC on the parameters of her travel.  Khin 
Nyunt said that in addition to the agreed to visits to NLD 
offices, ASSK had begun impromptu visits to monasteries and 
delivering roadside talks, often taking the opportunity to 
criticize the government and the performance of civil 
servants.  Khin Nyunt stated that the regime had evidence 
that ASSK had also been meeting with other political parties, 
some of whom had ties to groups responsible for recent 
bombings in Burma. 
 
3. (C)  In a strange twist, Razali said Khin Nyunt posited 
that ASSK\'s more threatening stance began after a January 
2003 meeting she had with ex-Charge d\'Affaires to Rangoon 
Priscilla Clapp (Note: Clapp made a personal visit to Rangoon 
in January.  If she met with ASSK, it was with no Embassy 
involvement.  End Note.)  COM asked Razali to clarify if Khin 
Nyunt indicated that the regime believed that Clapp was in 
Rangoon on instructions from Washington or if they understood 
that she was on a personal visit.  Razali said this was not 
clear from what Khin Nyunt said but the regime clearly linked 
the change in ASSK\'s strategy to the Clapp visit.  (Comment: 
This is in all likelihood a red herring thrown out by Khin 
Nyunt in order to build on the theme that ASSK is a pawn of 
foreign governments.  We do not know, however, how much the 
regime may believe its own propaganda.  End Comment.)  Khin 
Nyunt said that the regime had evidence that the NLD had 
recently been working with other political parties to \"bring 
things to a boil\" before Razali\'s visit and that there was a 
plan to proclaim democracy on June 17, ASSK\'s birthday and to 
demand a transfer of power by September. 
 
4. (C)  Razali said he was dumbfounded by the logic behind 
Khin Nyunt\'s presentation.  \"What do they expect, the people 
love her, of course they are going to turn out.\"  And he was 
very concerned with the regime\'s response to this perceived 
threat; \"If they think the crowds that came out to see her 
were bad, wait until they see what will happen if they 
continue to hold her.\"  He deemed it totally illogical to 
respond to this perceived threat with a harsh crackdown. 
Razali said he did not want to take on the substance of Khin 
Nyunt\'s presentation at that point and, instead, he told Khin 
Nyunt there would be time to hash through all of these issues 
later but the immediate priority was to get access to ASSK. 
Khin Nyunt responded by showing Razali two photographs dated 
May 31 showing ASSK sitting on a four-poster bed in nice 
surroundings with a few females, possibly her assistants. 
Razali said ASSK looked fine, \"not a scratch,\" in the photos, 
but he told Khin Nyunt that this was no substitute for 
meeting with her.  At this point, Khin Nyunt told Razali, \"I 
can\'t do it, it\'s not my decision, it is a group decision.\" 
Razali implored Khin Nyunt to take the issue to the others 
necessary to make the decision and make the case, reiterating 
that it was of utmost importance. 
 
5. (C)  Khin Nyunt finally responded by asking if Razali 
would meet with Vice Senior General Maung Aye on Monday, June 
9 in the morning to make the case for access to ASSK directly 
to him.  Razali told COM that this would be the first 
substantive meeting he would have ever had with Maung Aye. 
Razali speculated whether Khin Nyunt needed Maung Aye\'s 
support in order to take the issue to Senior General Than 
Shwe or if perhaps Maung Aye is behind the recent hard-liner 
retrenchment and crackdown.  Razali said Maung Aye has gone 
to lengths to avoid any substantive discussion with him, so 
Razali looks forward to hopefully gaining an insight into the 
decision making process of the junta\'s top three, in addition 
to obtaining access to ASSK.  He said he was not very 
confident that they would allow him access to her but there 
was at least a small chance.  At any rate, he felt that he 
would probably know after the Maung Aye meeting whether or 
not he would gain access to ASSK.  If not, he said he would 
probably leave on the noon flight to Kuala Lumpur. 
 
6. (C)  Discussing the intense press interest in his visit, 
Razali said he would just say at this point \"he continues to 
work hard to obtain access to ASSK.\"  After discussing 
various scenarios for a departure statement with the COM, he 
felt it probably best to provide a short statement in Rangoon 
before departing for KL where he will provide a full briefing 
to the international press. 
 
7. (C)  Comment:  The SE is well aware that the SPDC is 
probably trying to wear out his patience hoping he will leave 
so they can claim that the SE \"gave up.\"  Razali is 
determined, however, to go the last mile and see Maung Aye on 
June 9.  At this point though the SE did not seem hopeful of 
getting access to ASSK.  This is particularly worrisome as we 
and others in the diplomatic community are receiving more 
frequent reports that ASSK may have received serious injuries 
in the May 30 attack.  End Comment.

1. (C)  Summary:  UN Special Envoy Razali gave COM a private 
read-out of his meeting this morning, June 9, with Vice 
Senior General Maung Aye.  Maung Aye told Razali that \"as a 
special consideration\" to the UN and Razali\'s efforts, the 
SPDC had reversed a previous decision to not allow anyone 
access to Aung San Suu Kyi, and Razali could see her June 10 
at 10:00 in the morning at an undisclosed location.  The only 
conditions on the visit were that Razali cannot divulge where 
the meeting takes place and he must be brief in speaking with 
her.  When Razali asked when ASSK would be released, Maung 
Aye responded, \"As soon as it is possible.\"  Razali is 
briefing the diplomatic corps on these developments just 
prior to his visit to ASSK on June 10, and then leaving on a 
flight to Singapore at noon at the request of the SPDC.  He 
said he would not provide this information to any other 
members of the diplomatic corps except the Japanese 
Ambassador until the morning briefing.  COM said she would 
alert Washington but otherwise keep the information 
close-hold. End Summary. 
 
2. (C)  Special Envoy Razali briefed COM privately this 
afternoon (June 9) on his meeting earlier this morning with 
SPDC Vice Senior General Maung Aye.  This was Razali\'s first 
substantive meeting with the SPDC number two and he said it 
went quite well.  Razali said it was interesting to see the 
dynamics in the meeting, with Maung Aye relaxed and clearly 
in charge.  Maung Aye told Razali he was aware of the 
situation, Razali\'s efforts, and (interestingly) PM 
Mahathir\'s concerns.  He told Razali that \"as a special 
consideration\" to the UN and to Razali\'s efforts, the request 
to grant him access to ASSK had been reviewed by \"the 
organization\" and it was decided to reverse a previous 
decision to bar all access to her.  (Note:  Neither Razali 
nor post has ever heard of \"the organization\" before.  Razali 
said he plans to follow-up with the Foreign Minister to get a 
better understanding of what it refers to.  This could be a 
term for an SPDC policy council or a smaller subset of key 
decision-makers.  End Note.)  Maung Aye said Khin Nyunt would 
provide Razali with the details of the meeting and began to 
excuse himself.  In an effort to get a commitment for future 
meetings with Maung Aye, Razali noted how useful it had been 
to talk to him and said he hoped to meet with him in the 
future; he said Maung Aye just smiled.  Finally, Razali asked 
Maung Aye when ASSK would be released.  Maung Aye gave the 
enigmatic reply, \"As soon as it is possible.\" 
 
3. (C)  Khin Nyunt then took Maung Aye\'s chair and brought 
out a book with handwritten details on how the visit to ASSK 
would be handled.  He told Razali that he would be taken to a 
military headquarters where he would meet Brigadier General 
Than Tun (the military intelligence officer normally assigned 
as a liaison to ASSK).  The two of them would go together to 
another location to meet her.  Khin Nyunt told Razali that 
the two conditions for the meeting would be that Razali could 
not divulge the location of the meeting to anyone and that he 
had to keep the meeting brief.  Khin Nyunt added that Razali 
\"should not be concerned by the location where they meet\" 
because ASSK would be brought there for the meeting from 
another location.  Finally, Khin Nyunt asked Razali how long 
he planned to remain in Rangoon.  When Razali said he was 
flexible depending how things were progressing, Khin Nyunt 
suggested that he leave on the 12:15 P.M. Silkair flight to 
Singapore right after his meeting with ASSK.  Razali said he 
was a little taken aback by this, but he agreed.  (Note: 
Razali said he would provide Poloff with information on the 
ASSK meeting at the airport, if possible.  End Note.) 
 
4. (C)  COM asked if Razali had brought up the condition of U 
Tin Oo or other NLD members and supporters that have been 
detained and reportedly injured.  Razali said he had not 
raised this, preferring to focus on ASSK first and foremost. 
He said he would be meeting with the Foreign Minister later 
in the day and planned to discuss access to other detainees, 
the steps necessary to get national reconciliation back on 
track, and the decision-making process of the junta.  Razali 
said it was fascinating to see how relaxed and confident 
Maung Aye was and how Khin Nyunt was clearly in a subservient 
role in Maung Aye\'s presence.  Most significantly, he felt, 
was that there was no mention of Senior General Than Shwe 
during the meeting.  Razali said it was clear to him that he 
will need to engage with Maung Aye to a greater degree in 
order to move forward with his mission.

1. (C)  Summary:  UN Special Envoy Razali had a brief meeting 
with Aung San Suu Kyi this morning (June 10) and reported to 
diplomats later that she was not injured and was \"feisty, as 
usual.\"  While Razali was quite pleased, with good reason, 
that he gained access to ASSK, he made no progress on

With all NLD leaders under detention, all NLD offices closed, 
and arrests of members continuing, conditions are now worse 
than they were in October 2000 when the SE began his mission.

progress on the road to national reconciliation.  End Summary. 
 
Razali Confirms ASSK Is Okay 
 
2. (C)  On June 10, SE Razali told diplomats seeing him off 
at the airport that he had just met with NLD General 
Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi and that she was in good

condition.  He said ASSK was outspoken and \"feisty, as usual\" 
and she \"did not have a scratch on her.\"  The meeting took 
place at an undisclosed location (Razali told us yesterday 
that he had agreed with authorities not to disclose the 
location) and Razali\'s three assistants, who usually 
accompany him in meetings with ASSK, were not allowed to 
attend.  Instead, Brigadier General Than Tun, who normally 
serves as military intelligence\'s liaison officer with ASSK, 
was in the room during the meeting.  As evidence of ASSK\'s 
good health, Razali told the diplomats that she appeared to 
be giving some terse instructions to BG Than Tun in Burmese 
periodically during the meeting. 
 
3. (C)  Razali would not comment on what he discussed with 
ASSK but in response to a direct question said he did not 
raise the issue of the May 30 attack on her party as they 
traveled in Sagaing Division.  (Note: It seems odd that 
Razali would not raise this issue, since the attack is what 
precipitated ASSK\'s detention and international concerns that 
she was injured.  Hopefully, he will provide more information 
on this in a more private meeting.  End Note.)  The COM said 
she hoped Razali had conveyed to ASSK the intense 
international interest and concern in her well-being.  He 
replied that she was aware of \"all this.\" 
 
No Shift Evident In SPDC Position 
 
4. (C)  The COM asked Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win, 
who was presiding over the send-off, whether anyone else 
would now be able to have access to ASSK.  The DFM responded 
that, \"in all honesty, we are not thinking along those lines 
for the time being.\"  When the COM asked why ASSK continues 
to be held incommunicado, the DFM said it was \"for her own 
safety and security.\" 
 
5. (C)  While it is a relief that the SE has been able to 
determine that ASSK is alive and well, Razali\'s brief and 
closely monitored meeting with her was the minimum the SPDC 
could have done to address international criticism generated 
by the May 30 attack on her convoy and ensuing crackdown on 
the NLD.  The SPDC probably calculated that they might not be 
able to weather the storm of international protest (and 
possibly domestic unrest) if Razali left Rangoon 
empty-handed.  Having made this concession to international 
pressure, we expect the SPDC will now slide back into 
business as usual, and continue their crackdown on the NLD. 
(The DFM\'s remarks on her continued \"protective custody\" are 
the handwriting on the wall.) 
 
6. (C)  The SPDC\'s crackdown over the past ten days has 
produced conditions worse than those when Razali began his 
mission in October 2000.  At that time, at least some NLD 
offices were still open (none are now) and ASSK was under 
detention at her residence and could receive some 
international visitors.  Now she and NLD Vice Chairman U Tin 
Oo are being held incommunicado at undisclosed locations (and 
his health is still a concern), all other NLD leaders are 
under house detention, and arrests of NLD members are 
continuing. 
 
7. (C)  Comment:  Razali was quite pleased, with good reason, 
that he gained access to ASSK.  In his determination to do 
this, however, he failed to get any commitment from the SPDC 
on next steps on reversing their crackdown on the NLD. 
Razali noted (without apparent irony) that both Secretary One 
Khin Nyunt and Vice Senior General Maung Aye had assured him 
that they were still committed to the national reconciliation 
process.  Most distressing is that Razali was unable to 
address the larger objective of focusing the SPDC 
(particularly Senior General Than Shwe) on the urgent need to 
make tangible progress on the road to national 
reconciliation.

SUBJECT: SPDC STRIKES CONCILIATORY TONE IN SECOND BRIEFING 
ON MAY 30 AMBUSH 
 
REF: RANGOON 0647 
 
1. SUMMARY:  In a June 10 briefing for journalists and 
diplomats following UN Special Envoy Razali\'s departure from 
Rangoon, the Foreign Ministry provided more details of the 
May 30 ambush of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s (ASSK) motorcade near 
Depeyin and side-pedaled on several issues connected to the 
attack.  Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win announced 
that an official inquest by the Ministry of Home Affairs is 
underway and more details would be forthcoming.  The COM 
again requested a full accounting of the injured, dead and 
detained.  She also expressed the expectation that the SPDC 
would not merely return to the status quo ante May 30 but 
would take concrete steps forward on the path of national 
reconciliation. This briefing was unexpectedly conciliatory 
indicating that the government is on notice that the issue is 
bigger than access to ASSK and the NLD members - they must 
try to build some credibility, quickly, if they expect anyone 
to believe their \"commitment to national reconciliation.\" 
End Summary. 
 
2.  DeputyFonMin (DFM) Khin Maung Win reiterated that the 
SPDC regarded the events of May 30 as \"most unfortunate\" and 
that the \"safe custody\" measures for ASSK are temporary and 
will be lifted \"as soon as the situation returns to normal.\" 
He said Special Envoy Razali was granted the \"special 
gesture\" of a meeting with ASSK for two reasons:  to show 
their continuing cooperation with the United Nations, and 
because of the SPDC\'s trust in confidence in Mr. Razali 
himself. 
 
3.  He announced that the Ministry of Home Affairs had opened 
an official inquest into the May 30 \"incident.\"  Preliminary 
investigations show that violence erupted when ASSK\'s convoy 
attempted to \"plow through a crowd blocking the road.\"  He 
made much out of the fact that this occurred late at night in 
\"an area with no public lighting, there was much confusion, 
and things got out of hand.\"  (Note:  The government appears 
to be developing a new approach to describing the situation. 
Unlike the tone of certainty accompanying the statements of 
the last press briefing - \"There were 5000 people gathered. 
...  There were no military or police present at the time of 
the attack. ...  Only fifty were injured. ... No arrests were 
made - the government is emphasizing uncertainty, the 
confusion and dark, and that the inquest is \"ongoing\" and 
more details may yet be uncovered.  It gives them more leeway 
to retract or contradict statements made earlier.  End Note.) 
 
4.  The DFM \"clarified\" several statements made at the June 3 
briefing (Reftel).  He was careful to say, instead of \"50 
injured\" that 48 people presented themselves at the hospital 
for treatment, leaving the possibility that there were more 
injured who did not.  In response to a question about 
arrests, he said that no one had been \"arrested per se\" but 
that, \"as they say in the British newspapers, several people 
are helping us with our inquiries.\" 
 
5.  He reiterated that both Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo were 
not hurt in what the SPDC is now calling \"a melee\" instead of 
an \"incident.\" 
 
6.  Diplomats present reiterated their desire to have access 
to ASSK and Tin Oo.  The COM requested that the government 
provide a full accounting, including names of the dead and 
injured at the scene.  The DFM replied that he would try to 
comply.  She also expressed the expectation that SPDC would 
demonstrate their stated commitment to the national 
reconciliation process not merely by releasing ASSK and other 
detainees and reopening the NLD offices, but going forward 
with concrete steps to bring about national reconciliation. 
The DFM said he shared that sentiment, as \"we do not want to 
return to confrontation.\" 
 
7.  Comment:  This briefing was unexpectedly conciliatory. 
However, the assembled dip corps expressed disappointment 
that the government continues to stonewall on the issue of 
access to ASSK and the NLD leadership, and on the issue of 
the conditions and location of their detention.  But it 
appears that the government is starting to realize that 
attacking and accusing the NLD of provoking the clash, or 
claiming an international smear campaign against the SPDC, 
won\'t wash. They are also on notice that the issue is bigger 
than access to ASSK and the NLD members - they must try to 
build some credibility, quickly, if they expect anyone to 
believe their \"commitment to national reconciliation\".  End 
Comment.

MOVE FORWARD ON RECONCILIATION 
 
REF: RANGOON 665 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  On June 11, COM had a frank meeting with 
Minister of Home Affairs Colonel Tin Hlaing to discuss the 
recent crackdown on the NLD and to deliver an  advance copy 
of this year\'s Trafficking In Persons report.  On recent NLD 
detentions, Tin Hlaing denied press reports that the 
government told Special Envoy Razali that Aung San Suu Kyi 
would be released in immediately or in two weeks, saying 
there was no timetable for her release.  He assured the COM, 
however, that the International Committee of the Red Cross 
would have access to recent detainees once a police 
investigation of the incident on May 30 is completed 
(although this contradicts what ICRC has been told, see 
septel).  The Minister provided a detailed account of SPDC 
internal security concerns prior to May 30, and a description 
of what occurred the night of the clash.  The COM said that 
allowing Embassy officers to visit the site of the clash was 
a positive approach.  COM then described some of the 
information Emboffs collected which indicated a premeditated 
attack by trained individuals (some disguised as monks) and 
did not support the government\'s version of events.  She 
stressed the extreme importance the USG placed on a credible 
investigation of the attack and full accounting for the 
people who have been missing or were detained since then. 
She reiterated that the U.S. saw no justification for the 
continued detention of ASSK and other NLD members and called 
for their immediate release.  She urged the Minister to take 
actions to undo the harsh measures taken over the past 12 
days and to use his influence to get the national 
reconciliation process back on track.  She also provided the 
Minister a copy of the Trafficking in Persons report, noting 
that the government\'s failure to make progress on forced 
labor was the primary reason Burma was still on Tier 3.  The 
Minister said his government \"takes U.S. views very much to 
heart,\" and asked the COM to keep in close communication with 
him.  End Summary. 
 
NLD Crackdown 
 
2. (C)  In a June 11 meeting with Home Minister Tin Hlaing 
(accompanied by the Deputy Home Minister and an interpreter) 
the COM asked for clarification of news reports that Special 
Envoy Razali had said Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) might be 
released immediately or within two weeks.  The Minister said 
there must have been some mistake because there was no 
timetable set for her release.  He said that her protective 
custody is a temporary situation but there has been no 
decision when she might be released.  The Minister said a 
formal police investigation of the incident that occurred on 
May 30 is underway, intimating that the results of the 
investigation will have a bearing on ASSK\'s release. 
 
3. (C)  The COM expressed the USG\'s concern regarding those 
missing after the May 30 clash and urged the Minister to 
provide an accurate account of what transpired that night and 
to account for those that are missing, injured, or dead.  She 
asked if any charges had been fixed against those jailed 
after the attack and why 19 of the NLD leaders from the 
convoy were reportedly in protective custody and still 
incommunicado.  The Minister said no charges had been made 
against anyone yet, that 25 of the people detained that night 
were released yesterday, and that others were being held as 
part of the investigation.  He said the 19 NLD leaders were 
still in protective custody because, \"The situation is 
confusing, not stable, and not to our liking.  We want the 
dust to settle, then diplomats will be able to visit these 
individuals.\" 
 
The SPDC\'s Version of Events 
 
4. (C)  He elaborated that the SPDC had evidence and 
intelligence that the incident was pre-planned (he did not 
elaborate by whom).  He shared the following information, 
which he deemed \"very confidential,\" regarding events leading 
up to the incident: 
 
-- Earlier this year, ASSK and Senior General Than Shwe had 
dinner together and agreed on steps to national 
reconciliation and democratic reform.  Part of the agreement 
was that ASSK could rally her supporters in NLD offices but 
not elsewhere, and she could travel to any part of the 
country.  (Note:  This is the first official confirmation of 
this meeting.  ASSK has always avoided any direct discussion 
or even acknowledgment of meetings with Than Shwe or Khin 
Nyunt when we have met with her.  End Note.) 
 
-- Up until January or February, everything went according to 
plan and there was no tension.  Then, the SPDC received 
information that the NLD was planning a political change in 
June and ASSK started to break the rules established for her 
travels (see reftel, para. 3; this parallels what S-1 said to 
Razali.)  She began to hold roadside meetings and speak to 
crowds gathered to see her at monasteries.  She started 
traveling without keeping military intelligence advised of 
her plans, sometimes traveling through the night.  This 
caused problems for them because they could not provide her 
adequate security.  Military intelligence warned her 
repeatedly to keep them advised of her travel plans, but she 
did not. 
 
-- In Kachin State, the SPDC found that a lot of people did 
not like ASSK and this became a big concern for the 
government.  ASSK continued to cause problems which 
aggravated the people such as not paying tolls at bridge 
crossings, causing traffic jams with her motorcade, and using 
monks as a means of taking advantage of uneducated poor 
people. 
 
-- At the same time, insurgent groups along the Thai border 
began rallying support for ASSK, producing pamphlets, and 
planting explosive devices.  These activities seemed to be 
\"in synch\" with her activities. 
 
-- Secretary One Khin Nyunt had planned to meet with ASSK in 
May but at the last minute she said she would be traveling, 
and she designated NLD Secretary U Lwin to meet with 
Secretary One. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
5. (C)  Note: It is very unlikely that these \"confidential\" 
tidbits are original thoughts from the Minister; they are 
most likely the party line on why ASSK\'s activities could not 
be allowed to continue (the points about people not liking 
her because she did not pay bridge tolls, disrupted traffic, 
etc., have been leveled before and are becoming tiresome). 
The failure to coordinate her travel with authorities, fears 
of links to subversive groups, and the affront to Khin Nyunt 
for proposing a substitute to represent her at a requested 
meeting with him, combined with concerns about her growing 
popularity and independence, sound closer to the mark as to 
why the SPDC was unhappy.  End Note. 
 
6. (C)  The Minister then segued into the events of May 30, 
saying that it was very confusing because it was dark that 
night but, so far, the following information was available. 
ASSK was supposed stay in Mon Ywa that night but instead 
chose to travel toward Depeyin.  At a certain place in the 
road, there were 2,000 (down from the governments previous 
claim of 5,000) people \"who were against her\" who had blocked 
the road.  Her motorcycle escort turned back when it saw 
these people but her car (with lights switched off) forced 
its way straight through the crowd, fortunately not injuring 
anyone.  The second car, carrying NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo, 
also attempted to force its way through the crowd but it hit 
some people and came to an abrupt halt.  A trailing 
motorcycle ran into it and crashed.  The third car ran over 
the motorcyclist, killing him, and the whole convoy came to a 
halt.  Violence then broke out until security police reached 
the scene, restored order, and took the injured to the 
hospital.  U Tin Oo got out of his car and walked to Depeyin 
where he was put in protective custody; he was uninjured. 
After ASSK made it through the crowd, she also met the police 
and was taken into protective custody. 
 
U.S. Concerns 
7. (C)  The COM said the information was appreciated and that 
the lack of interference with the Embassy officers who 
visited the site of the clash on June 4-5 was a positive 
step.  She said that the information the Emboffs gathered 
from many people in the area, and the items they found at the 
scene, did not support the Minister\'s account of the 
incident.  She provided a synopsis of the attack as related 
to Emboffs by many sources, which indicated that the convoy 
was blocked by trucks and attacked by an organized and 
trained group of armed individuals who wore white armbands to 
identify themselves.  She said the idea that 2,000 local 
people would congregate in a field at night to attack ASSK 
was not a credible story and she hoped the government 
investigation would provide a more credible account.  The COM 
also reiterated the USG\'s deep concern for the people missing 
and possibly injured or dead as a result of the attack.  She 
urged the Minister to ensure a full accounting, including 
names of the dead, as soon as possible. 
 
ICRC Access 
 
8. (C)  The COM noted that the ICRC has a standing agreement 
with the government to be notified of new political arrests 
and to have access to these detainees as quickly as possible, 
and asked if ICRC had been given access to those detained on 
May 30 or to other NLD members detained since that night. 
The Minister responded that the ICRC did not have access to 
these detainees yet but that it would be granted access as 
soon as possible.  He said that normally ICRC is not granted 
access to detainees while an investigation is underway.  The 
COM emphasized the importance of granting ICRC access to 
these detainees as quickly as possible.  The Minister 
responded that he was the focal point for the ICRC, he knew 
the importance of their work, and he would make sure they got 
access.  (Note:  According to the head of ICRC in Rangoon, 
Secretary One Khin Nyunt told him on June 10 that ICRC would 
 
SIPDIS 
not get access to detainees taken in at the May 30 incident 
or since.  The Home Minister was present at that meeting but 
perhaps he still hopes to gain access for ICRC.  End Note.) 
 
National Reconciliation Is Top Priority 
 
9. (C)  The COM said that the USG and the world is watching 
and the SPDC needs to not only restore the political climate 
that existed prior to the May 30 clash, but go beyond that in 
order to demonstrate that it is still committed to national 
reconciliation.  She urged the Minister to do everything he 
could to quickly move the process forward and reminded him 
that he once told her \"I do not like to keep Burmese people 
in jail\".  (Note:  While we do not have any illusions that 
the Minister has the authority to act alone on this, he is 
one of the more approachable Ministers and he has good access 
to Secretary One.  Certainly the COM\'s comments will be 
reported to at least that level, and hopefully higher.  End 
Note.) 
 
Trafficking in Persons 
 
10. (C)  The COM provided the Minister with a copy of this 
year\'s Trafficking In Persons report and Poloff provided an 
overview of the Burma section of the report.  TIP falls under 
the Minister\'s purview and Poloff was able to report on 
several areas in which the Ministry and its partners had made 
progress on TIP during the year.  Poloff noted, however, that 
Burma remained a Tier 3 country on the TIP ranking in large 
part due to its failure to make adequate progress on forced 
labor, which is included in the U.S. definition of TIP.  The 
Minister appeared to appreciate receiving the report and 
feedback on his Ministry\'s actions (he does not have 
authority on forced issues). 
 
11. (C)  Comment:  Despite the frank and candid nature of the 
COM\'s message in this one-hour meeting, the Minister was very 
cordial and stated in his closing remarks that he \"takes U.S. 
views very much to heart,\" and asked that the Embassy 
continue to provide him with news releases and information on 
this matter and other issues as it becomes available.  As 
with a handful of other Ministers, we have the impression 
that the Home Minister recognizes the serious problems in his 
government.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S OPIUM FIELDS -- GOING, GOING, .... 
 
REF: RANGOON 575 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez. Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: According to information presented by UNODC\'s 
Resident Representative, Burma eliminated approximately 
one-quarter of its opium fields in 2003.  According to 
UNODC\'s latest survey, the acreage under opium cultivation in 
Burma in 2003 totaled only 62,100 hectares, down 24 percent 
from 2002.  The reduction, according to UNODC, was equivalent 
to the entire current crop in Laos. End Summary. 
 
Acreage under Cultivation 
 
2. (C) UNODC will release its worldwide opium survey in New 
York next week.  In a pre-brief on June 13, UNODC\'s Resident 
Representative told the Chief of Mission that opium 
cultivation in Burma had again declined radically.  According 
to UNODC\'s survey, the acreage under opium cultivation in 
Burma in 2003 totaled only 62,100 hectares, down 24 percent 
from 2002 and more than 60 percent from the 163,000 hectares 
planted in Burma in 1996.  The Resident Representative noted 
that the reduction in acreage under cultivation in Burma in 
2003 was equivalent to Laos\' entire current crop. 
 
3. (C) According to UNODC\'s numbers, the reduction was 
sharpest in northern Shan State, where acreage under opium 
cultivation was down 45 percent. In eastern Shan state, the 
reduction was 26 percent; in southern Shan State 19 percent. 
Only in the Wa territories did acreage under cultivation 
increase.  While the acreage under opium cultivation was down 
in the Wa Alternative Development Project area around Mong 
Yang and Mong Pawk (by about 12 percent), in the Wa 
territories as a whole, acreage under cultivation was up 21 
percent to 21,300 hectares (i.e., about one-third of Burma\'s 
total production.) 
 
Yield/Hectare 
 
4. (C) Largely offsetting the decline in acreage, however, 
was a sharp increase in yield, thanks to excellent weather. 
According to UNODC, the yield/hectare throughout Burma was up 
about 27 percent from 10.2 kilograms per hectare to 12.9 
kilograms per hectare.  As with acreage under cultivation, 
yields were also highest in the Wa territories at about 16.1 
kilograms per hectare. 
 
Production 
 
5. (C) Overall production, finally, came in at about par with 
2002, as increased yields per hectare approximately offset 
the decline in acreage under cultivation.  According to 
UNODC\'s numbers, Burma produced about 810 metric tons of 
opium in 2003, down only marginally from the 828 metric tons 
UNODC estimated in 2002. 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C) A couple of points stand out from UNODC\'s survey. 
First, the weather for opium production was excellent for 
opium production in Burma in 2003.  There was no drought. 
Yet acreage under production declined radically, most 
logically as a result of government efforts. 
 
7. (C) Secondly, in 2003, the government held the cease-fire 
groups to their pledges regarding opium. In fact the largest 
declines in 2003 took place in territories controlled by the 
Peng Kya Shin\'s Kokang Chinese, which had pledged to be out 
of opium production by 2000, and then reneged.  In 2003, 
thanks to Burmese government pressure, the acreage under 
cultivation in the Kokang Chinese capital district of Lawkai 
was cut to barely 20 percent of its 2002 level. 
 
8. (C) Finally, in 2005 the government will get another 
opportunity to show if it is really ready to take on the the 
ceasefire groups.  As matters now stand, 2005 is to be the 
last year of opium production in the Wa territories.  End 
Comment.

1. (C) Summary: ICRC expects to visit Aung San Suu Kyi and 
the other detained NLD leaders within the next few days. 
Meanwhile, the universities have reopened and Rangoon remains 
quiet. End Summary. 
 
ICRC To See ASSK and Other NLD Leaders 
 
2. (C) ICRC officers have advised us that ICRC has been given 
permission to see Aung San Suu Kyi and the other NLD leaders 
who were detained following the May 30 ambush in Depeyin. 
ICRC officials are to meet with GOB representatives today or 
tommorow to work out the modalities for the visits, which 
will probably take place during the weekend of June 21 and 22. 
 
Detainees Released 
 
3. (U) In a diplomatic note dated June 13, the GOB said that 
it had released 46 persons who had been detained in 
connection with the May 30 attack in Depeyin.  Twenty-five 
people were released on June 11; 21 on June 12.  Apparently, 
however, none of the persons released were picked up at the 
scene of the attack.  From information we have been able to 
gather, all appear to have been detained after the event as 
the GOB searched for signs of a conspiracy. 
 
Universities Open; Rangoon Quiet 
 
4. (C) Universities and secondary schools reopened throughout 
Burma on June 16.  Thus far, the country remains quiet.  With 
the exception of a very few small and isolated 
demonstrations, the public has not taken to the streets to 
protest the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi or the closure of 
the NLD offices.  Some preliminary security arrangements have 
been put in place in Rangoon (e.g.; some additional barbed 
wire at Rangoon\'s city hall and a few more MI surveillance 
units on the street), but there are no signs yet that the 
government anticipates any serious trouble.

1) (C) Summary:  Leon de Reidmatten (Special Envoy Razali\'s 
liaison in Rangoon) informed COM and EU Ambassadors that, 
according to the SE, Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) was in Insein 
Prison in Rangoon.  ASSK told Razali she believed that she 
was being held under the provisions of Section 10(a) of a 
1975 law titled \"Law to Safeguard the State Against the 
Dangers of Subversive Elements\".  This law allows for the 
\"detaining and arresting\" of an individual, and holding that 
individual for up to five years in a detention facility. 
ASSK has never been held under 10(a) before.  Her previous 
periods of detention were under house arrest.  De Reidmatten 
said he has already informed ICRC that ASSK is being held in 
Insein prison, but he added that he did not believe ICRC 
would be successful in seeing her any time soon.  End Summary. 
 
2) (C) Leon de Reidmatten (Special Envoy Razali\'s liaison in 
Rangoon) briefed the COM, and the French, German, Italian and 
UK ambassadors on Thursday, June 19, upon his return from 
meeting with the SE in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, June 17.  He 
told the group that, according to the SE, the site of 
Razali\'s meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon was Insein 
Prison.  He said that ASSK was being held in a special 
freestanding two-room cell, with toilet facilities, that had 
been built specifically for her in the mid- 1990\'s, although 
she has never occupied it before (Note:  de Reidmatten 
actually saw this structure when he was visiting Insein in 
connection with his previous job with the ICRC.  End Note). 
ASSK is being guarded by three female prison guards. 
 
3) (C) Razali told de Reidmatten that ASSK said she believed 
she was being held under the provisions of Section  10(a) of 
a 1975 law titled \"Law to Safeguard the State Against the 
Dangers of Subversive Elements\".  This law allows for the 
\"detaining and arresting\" of an individual, and holding that 
individual for up to five years in a detention facility 
(Note: in practice, many prisoners are held longer under 
10(a) and it is also used to detain prisoners even after they 
have completed their formal sentences.  End Note).  Another 
section of this law, Section 10(b), allows for the 
\"restraining\" of individuals for up to one year under house 
arrest, but the period can be extended, as has been the case 
previously with ASSK (Note: the ten members of the NLD 
Central Executive Committee are (CEC) are apparently being 
held under this provision, confirming what the guards in 
front of two of the CEC members\' houses let slip to COM when 
she tried to visit on June 1.  End Note). 
 
4) (C) Although we do not know on what ASSK bases her belief 
that she and the members of the CEC (and possibly many 
others), are being held in order to \"Safeguard the State\", 
the regime\'s clumsy pretense that they are under \"protective 
custody\" is ridiculous and insulting.  In response to direct 
questioning by the COM on several occasions, both privately 
and publicly, the Deputy Foreign Minister and the Minister of 
Home Affairs denied that ASSK or the members of the CEC are 
under arrest.  Perhaps technically, this is true - perhaps 
they are being detained or restrained and not arrested.  But 
the fact is they are prisoners, and probably will be for a 
long time. 
 
5)  (C) De Reidmatten told COM he wrote to the Minister of 
Home Affairs to ask if ASSK was being held under 10(a), but 
the Minister has not confirmed, denied, or clarified the 
conditions of her detention.  De Reidmatten said he has 
already informed ICRC that ASSK is being held in Insein 
prison, but he added that he did not believe ICRC would be 
successful in seeing her any time soon. 
 
6)  (C) Comment: The briefing from de Reidmatten is the first 
time that anyone in the group had heard from Razali as to 
ASSK\'s specific location or conditions of detention. This is 
also the first time that we have heard that ASSK told Razali 
she believed that she was being held under 10(a).  ASSK has 
never been held under 10(a) before.  Her previous periods of 
detention were house arrest under the provisions of 10 (b). 
\"Detaining and arresting\" ASSK under Section 10(a) would 
signal that the regime may be determined to retain a tight 
grip on her and the NLD for a very long time to come and does 
nothing to support their claims of commitment to the process 
of national reconciliation.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S COUNTERNARCOTICS PERFORMANCE 
 
REF: A. STATE 100273 
     B. STATE 153955 
 
1.  Summary:  The Burmese government (GOB) has reduced opium 
cultivation, cooperated with the United States, Australia, 
China, Thailand, and other states on a series of major 
narcotics cases, and continued to prosecute traffickers.  It 
has failed in regard to its new money laundering law, whose 
implementation has been delayed by the collapse of Burma\'s 
private banking system.  The GOB has deliberately chosen to 
give the Wa and other former insurgent groups time to exit 
the narcotics trade - the last of these grace periods expires 
in 2005.  The GOB has cracked down whenever former insurgent 
groups have broken their pledges and, after 2005, the United 
Wa State Army, like all other groups in Burma, will be fair 
game for government enforcement actions.  Burma\'s current 
narcotics legislation (basically the 1993 Law on Narcotic 
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) is more than adequate for 
the investigation and prosecution of major drug offenses.  It 
has been used already to put more than 10,000 felons behind 
bars with sentences in excess of ten years each.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. The paragraphs below are keyed to the criteria outlined in 
our counternarcotics demarche (reftel A). 
 
3. Facilitate the participation of independent monitors to 
verify poppy eradication and other counternarcotics efforts. 
 
Burma cooperates with the United States on its annual opium 
yield survey and UNODC on census surveys of opium production. 
 In fact, all recent estimates of opium and heroin production 
in Burma have been compiled by the United States and the 
United Nations on the basis of these surveys.  According to 
the United States, Burma reduced opium production by more 
than three-quarters between 1996 and 2002.  According the 
United Nations, Burma reduced its opium production by more 
than half over the same period.  The results of the U.S. 
survey in 2003 is not yet available.  According to the United 
Nations, Burma reduced its opium fields by a further 24 
percent in 2003, despite good weather.  By their estimate, 
the acreage under opium cultivation in Burma in 2003 declined 
to only 62,200 hectares, down more than 100,000 hectares from 
the area under cultivation in 1996. 
 
Burma cooperates closely with the United States\' Drug 
Enforcement Administration and the Australian Federal Police 
on narcotics enforcement activities.  Both DEA and AFP 
maintain active offices in Burma.  Both offices have 
maintained detailed records of the Burmese government\'s 
seizures, arrests, and other law enforcement operations in 
recent years.  DEA\'s file, compiled and verified by agents 
who have been involved in investigations in Burma, is 
available in Washington. 
 
4. Arrest and prosecute the senior leadership of heroin and 
methamphetamine trafficking organizations. 
 
Burma has arrested over 90,000 persons on drug-related 
charges over the past 15 years.  Through the end of 2002, 42 
persons were sentenced to death for drug-related offenses in 
Burma, and another 37 were imprisoned for life.  During the 
same period, more than 12,500 persons were sentenced to 
prison for ten years or more for narcotics-related offenses. 
These arrests and prosecutions continued in 2003.  While 
statistics on prosecutions are not yet available, preliminary 
data indicate that Burma arrested more than 700 suspects in 
drug-related cases during the first three months of 2003. 
 
Many of these arrests and convictions involved major drug 
syndicates.  Many also involved close cooperation with the 
United States, Australia, and other western law enforcement 
agencies.  Among the most notable were the following: 
 
-- Cooperation with the United States and China in the 
investigation of the \"1-2-5\" syndicate, which led to the 
arrest of 28 persons in the United States, Hong Kong, China, 
and India in May 2003.  Reportedly, this group had been 
responsible for the export of more than $100 million in 
heroin to the United States since 2000. 
 
-- Cooperation with China in a series of arrests and seizures 
that have continued throughout 2001 and 2002 all along the 
Chinese border following the signature of a Chinese/Burmese 
MOU on counternarcotics operations in January 2001.  Since 
then, Burma has turned over 60 fugitives to China, including 
members of one group (Tan Xiao Lin and company) which China 
described as the \"largest armed drug-trafficking gang in the 
Golden Triangle.\" 
 
-- Cooperation with Thailand in the seizure of 116 kilograms 
of heroin and 7.8 million methamphetamine tablets in February 
2002.  Two of the principals behind this shipment were also 
eventually convicted in Rangoon and sentenced to \"indefinite\" 
(i.e., unending) terms in prison. 
 
-- Cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement 
Administration and the Australian Federal Police in the 
seizure of 357 kilograms of heroin in Fiji in October 2000. 
Death sentences were eventually handed down in Rangoon for 
two drug kingpins connected with this case. 
 
5. Establish a mechanism for reliable measurement of 
methamphetamine production and demonstrate progress in 
reducing production and increasing seizures. 
 
There is no mechanism for reliably measuring illicit 
methamphetamine production in any country, including the US. 
The most commonly used procedure is to take seizures and 
multiply by 10.  If applied to Burma, that measure would 
suggest production of 320 million tablets in 2001, 94 million 
tablets in 2002, and 19 million tablets during the first 
three months of 2003.  However, the GOB believe that this 
reduction in seizures is due more to changing patterns of 
methamphetamine production and trafficking than it is to the 
overall reduction in production.  Since 2002, under pressure 
from the GOB, more traffickers have taken to mixing chemicals 
at sites along the Chinese/Burmese border and then shipping 
the product in powder or crystal form along the Mekong River 
to plants in Laos, Thailand, and Burma where the drug is 
flavored for local markets and stamped into tablets.  The net 
result is that the product spends far less time in Burma than 
before; hence, the lower seizures. 
 
6. Establish an effective program for the control of 
precursor chemicals. 
 
Burma does not have a precursor chemical industry; nor does 
it produce any of the precursor chemicals used in the 
manufacture of heroin, amphetamine-type stimulants, or other 
synthetic drugs.  All chemicals used for the production of 
narcotics in Burma (with the exception of opium itself) are 
imported from China, India, Thailand, and other states.  None 
are produced locally. 
 
Burma has outlawed 25 precursor chemicals, including 
ephedrine, acetic anhydride, and even caffeine (in bulk). 
However, it has not yet been able to stem trafficking from 
neighboring countries, despite seizures in 2002 which 
amounted to 2,900 liters of acetic anhydride, 26,000 liters 
of chemical liquids, 4,800 kilograms of chemical powders, and 
1,700 kilograms of ephedrine.  On the other hand, it has 
begun to build the international cooperation that is required 
to control this trade.  In January 2003, Burma held its first 
trilateral conference with India and China on precursor 
chemicals, and in March met bilaterally with India on the 
same topic.  As a result of those meetings, India is now 
considering creating a 100-mile wide exclusion zone along its 
border with Burma within which any possession of ephedrine 
would be illegal.  A similar zone on the Indian frontier 
already exists for acetic anhydride. 
 
7.  Create a special task force of police and prosecutors to 
target and investigate high-level drug traffickers and drug 
trafficking groups. 
 
Drug enforcement efforts in Burma are led by the Central 
Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), which is comprised 
of personnel from the police, customs, military intelligence, 
and the army.  CCDAC now has 21 drug-enforcement task forces 
around the country, with most located in major cities and 
along key transit routes near Burma\'s borders with China, 
India, and Thailand.  CCDAC\'s units are underfunded and badly 
equipped.  Nevertheless, they are bringing narcotics 
traffickers to heel and securing convictions.  As noted 
above, more than 90,000 persons have been arrested for 
narcotics-related offenses in Burma over the past 15 years 
and more than 10,000 have sentenced to 10 years or more in 
prison.  CCDAC has also developed arrangements for 
cooperation with the United States, China, Thailand, and 
India, among others, that have allowed law enforcement agents 
around the world to move effectively against major drug 
cartels. 
 
Burma, in short, has an organization that has already proved 
that it can move effectively against high-level drug 
traffickers and drug trafficking groups.  What it does not 
have is a political situation that will allow it to move 
aggressively against former insurgent groups, like the United 
Wa State Army and others implicated in the drug trade, for 
fear of reigniting the insurgencies that devastated eastern 
Burma for so many decades before 1989.  Burma has 
deliberately chosen to slowly wean these former insurgent 
groups from their dependence on the narcotics trade, while 
building power at the center to use when the grace periods it 
has allowed these groups run out.  In 1997, the Eastern Shan 
State Army of Sai Lin promised to end opium production in its 
cease-fire area and did so.  In 2000, the Kokang Chinese of 
Pen Kya Shin broke their pledge to end opium production and, 
since 2001, have been raked by counter-narcotics operations 
that have been mounted by both the Burmese and Chinese 
governments.  In 2003, as a result, opium production in the 
Kokang Chinese capital district of Lawkai was a mere fraction 
(20 percent) of its level two years earlier.  In 2005, the 
United Wa State Army is scheduled to end opium production. 
If it fails, it will get the same treatment from the Chinese 
and Burmese that the Kokang Chinese have already tasted. 
 
8.  Fully implement and enforce Burma\'s money-laundering 
legislation. 
 
The GOB enacted new and relatively powerful money laundering 
legislation in June 2002.  That legislation criminalizes 
money laundering in connection with virtually every kind of 
serious criminal activity and levies heavy responsibilities 
on banks in regard to reporting.  Penalties are also 
substantial.  Implementation of the new legislation has 
lagged, however.  While the government held training seminars 
on money laundering, started several investigations, and 
seized assets in connection with several major narcotics 
cases, it has not yet prosecuted these cases as violations of 
the money-laundering law.  Neither has it published 
regulations to guide bank reporting in regard to suspicious 
transactions. 
 
The net result is that the government is effectively working 
only with the asset seizure provisions of its 1993 narcotics 
law.  Perhaps deterred by a banking system crisis which 
ripped through the country in February 2003, it has not 
really yet put its money laundering legislation to work. 
 
9.  Take effective measures to stem the flow of illicit drug 
money into the banking system and economic enterprises and to 
end joint economic ventures with the leaders of drug 
trafficking organizations. 
 
Money, illicit or otherwise, is not flowing into Burma\'s 
banking system, which collapsed in February 2003.  Since then 
deposits at Burma\'s banks have declined by estimated 40 
percent, with the hardest hit banks being those, like the 
Asia Wealth Bank, Myanmar Mayflower Bank, and Myanmar 
Oriental Bank, that were rumored to have connections with 
criminal elements.  The GOB has not attempted to bail the 
banks out of their current predicament; rather, it has let 
them slowly collapse as monuments to bad banking. 
 
A variety of factors contributed to this banking system 
crash, including a long-standing climate of financial 
repression, the collapse of Burma\'s informal financial 
institutions, and the introduction of Burma\'s new money 
laundering law, which required bank depositors to prove, if 
challenged, the legal origin of their funds.  Since accurate 
record-keeping is a rarely practiced art in Burma, many 
businessmen reacted to the new legislation, and the 
possibility that the government might seize their funds, by 
withdrawing their deposits.  This was probably not the 
primary cause of the crash, but was one of the straws that 
broke the back of Burma\'s banks. 
 
The GOB does not have joint ventures with the leaders of drug 
trafficking organizations.  Rather, it has given corporations 
like the United Wa State Party\'s Hong Pang Company outright 
concessions for the operation of a variety of businesses 
which range from farms to ranches to ruby mines and other 
trading and industrial establishments.  This has been 
controversial, both in Burma and abroad, but the GOB has 
argued that it is necessary, for two reason: (1) to give 
known narcotics trafficking groups an alternative source of 
income; (2) to tie these groups more closely to the Burmese 
economy.  The Burmese view is that these former insurgents 
are less likely to go back into rebellion if they have 
interests in the Burmese economy. 
 
10.  Amend Burma\'s substantive and procedural criminal laws 
to facilitate effective investigation and prosecution of 
major drug traffickers. 
 
With UNODC\'s assistance, Burma has recently completed the 
draft of a new mutual legal assistance law which will 
facilitate legal and judicial cooperation with other 
countries.  Reportedly, this draft legislation will be made 
law later this year.  The legal regime will also be helped by 
the final publication of the rules and regulations for the 
2002 money laundering law.  However, with the banking system 
now imploding, that is not a critical issue. 
 
Otherwise, Burma\'s current narcotics legislation (basically 
the 1993 Law on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) 
is more than adequate for the investigation and prosecution 
of major drug offenses.  It is completely in compliance with 
the recommendations of the 1988 UN Drug Convention and has 
been used already to put more than 10,000 felons behind bars 
with sentences in excess of ten years each.

SUBJECT: NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS - BURMESE GOVERNMENT CENSORS 
U.S. PERIODICALS 
 
 
1. (U) The Burmese government is now censoring or controlling 
distribution of some foreign periodicals that are normally 
sold with official authorization in Burma.  This is an effort 
to remove international reports of the May 30 attack on the 
National League for Democracy (NLD) convoy in Depeyin and 
subsequent detainment of Aung San Suu Kyi and the leadership 
of the NLD. 
 
2.  (U) TIME and NEWSWEEK, which are distributed by a local 
bookstore, were censored by the Burmese Press Scrutiny Board 
to eliminate any such reports.  We have attempted to locate 
and buy the June 16 and June 23 issues of TIME, with no 
success (Note: the June 16 issue of TIME featured a photo of 
some of the bloody clothing and weapons that Embassy officers 
recovered at the site of the May 30 attack. End Note.). The 
June 16 issue of NEWSWEEK is available -  minus pages 15-18 
containing the article \"The Missing Lady\", written by Joe 
Cochrane (although the magazine\'s Table of Contents lists the 
article beside a picture of Aung San Suu Kyi).  Other popular 
foreign periodicals, such as the English language editions of 
the major Thai dailies, the \"Bangkok Nation\" and the \"Bangkok 
Post\", continue to be sold uncensored (although several days 
old) on the streets of Rangoon. 
 
3.  (U) These foreign publications, together with 
international broadcasters such as VOA, RFA and BBC, are a 
vital source of information for Burmese, who cannot read 
reliable reports in the vernacular press.  The only reporting 
on the events of May 30 they have seen in the 
government-controlled press have been articles blaming any 
\"unrest\" on the actions of the NLD and repeating the 
government\'s dubious numbers of death and casualties. 
 
4) (U) The Embassy American Center makes uncensored versions 
of major international periodicals such as TIME, NEWSWEEK, 
International Herald Tribune, and many others, available to 
the public six days a week. Burmese journalists and others 
continue to keep abreast of events inside their country by 
reading these foreign media at the American Center.  In 
recent weeks, the American Center Library has been even more 
crowded than usual, particularly with students whose 
universities were shut following the May 30 ambush.

REF: RANGOON 4 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The Embassy has received much solicited and 
unsolicited reaction to the impending U.S. sanctions. We\'ve 
heard from foreign diplomats, businessmen, resident U.S. 
citizens, some NLD members, and GOB economic officials. 
Generally people understand our motives, but are very 
skeptical that our choice of action will prove effective. 
Even the bureaucrats seem resigned to the inevitable 
punishment.  The NLD members with whom we spoke support the 
U.S. efforts, though they agree that sanctions imposed 
without the support of ASEAN or China would not be enough to 
force this regime to change its mind on political reforms. 
As for American citizens, the two most specific concerns come 
from long-term residents, concerned about their ability to 
continue living and working here, and from U.S. exporters 
with containers on the docks who are unsure whether they 
should give the order to load. End summary. 
 
The Diplomats 
 
2. (SBU) Both the Korean and French commercial attaches 
requested meetings to discuss pending U.S. trade sanctions. 
The Korean attache raised his concerns about the likely fate 
of around 40 Korean investors who are running garment 
factories.  Garments make up a very large portion of Burmese 
exports to the United States.  He told us that most of these 
investors would have to pack up and try to move on should the 
U.S. market become inaccessible to them.  He said, though, 
that the larger Korean investors (such as Daewoo, which has a 
joint venture garment factory with the Union of Myanmar 
Economic Holdings, Ltd.) would likely remain in Burma, 
attempting to sell more to the European market. 
 
3. (SBU) The French attache was not critical of the new 
possible sanctions, admitting that his government too was 
considering (in the EU context) additional measures.  Both he 
and his Korean colleague understood the reasons the United 
States wanted to take action.  However, they both questioned 
whether the import ban could damage the government when the 
vast majority of garment sector factories and output is in 
private sector hands.  (This is a fact, reported in reftel, 
we\'ve noticed various editorials and NGO press statements 
seem to misunderstand.)  Both pointed out that the import ban 
would lead to factory closures and unemployment at a time of 
pre-existing economic hardship. 
 
The Businesspeople 
 
4. (SBU) Garment factory owners are understandably frightened 
by the likely import ban.  They repeated their oft-heard 
refrain that the garment industry contributes very little to 
government coffers, employs about 100,000 workers (mostly 
women), and is nearly 100 percent private sector.  However, 
they understand that the root of their problems was not U.S. 
sanctions, but inept GOB economic policies.  Other exporters 
of products to the United States (a fishery owner and a 
timber merchant) said they are not really concerned about the 
ban, as their major markets are elsewhere, but scoffed at the 
notion that the new sanctions would have even a psychological 
effect on the country\'s policymakers. 
 
The US Citizens 
 
5. (SBU) The economic and consular sections have been getting 
a steady stream of calls from U.S. citizens concerned about 
the impact of the pending import ban, and the possibility of 
a travel ban.  In both sections these inquiries have followed 
a familiar thread: What are the details of the new sanctions? 
 Will it hurt my business/ability to travel to, or live in, 
Burma?  As these measures will have no impact on the regime, 
why is the U.S. government imposing them? 
 
6. (SBU) The two most specific concerns come from long-term 
American residents in Burma, concerned about their ability to 
continue living and working here, and from U.S. exporters 
with containers on the docks who are unsure whether they 
should give the order to load.  This latter group fears that 
the sanctions will come into effect while their shipment is 
en route, and Customs in the United States won\'t accept any 
grandfathering.  When more details are available on these two 
topics, we plan to put out a bulletin to U.S. citizens in 
Burma and hold a town meeting to try and address their 
concerns. 
 
The Opposition 
 
7. (C) We had a chance to brief a few of the remaining free 
mid-level NLD officials on the proposed U.S. sanctions. 
Those with whom we spoke have little economic background, but 
understand sanctions and their use as a policy tool.  They 
were quite supportive of sanctions as a gesture of U.S. 
displeasure with the SPDC and its recent actions.  The 
officials opined that the psychological impact on the regime 
would outweigh the comparatively minor economic damage and 
unemployment (100,000 workers out of a workforce of roughly 
10-20 million) that would be caused by the new sanctions. 
The NLD members support the U.S. efforts, though they agreed 
that sanctions imposed without the support of ASEAN or China 
would not be enough to force this regime to change its mind 
on political reforms. 
 
The Government 
 
8. (C) We also discussed impending sanctions with officials 
of one of the state-owned trade banks, and of the 
GOB-affiliated Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI).  The UMFCCI official, 
representing Burmese private sector interests, told us he and 
most of the UMFCCI membership understood the motivation for 
sanctions, and who was really to blame for Burma\'s dismal 
business climate.  He quizzed us carefully on what, if 
anything, could stop the rush toward an import ban.  We told 
him that at this point, nothing short of a significant and 
irreversible step toward political transition (i.e., more 
than just the release of ASSK) would change the direction of 
U.S. policy.  We advised him to use UMFCCI\'s limited, but 
existent, lobbying power with the SPDC to try and convince 
the regime to take these steps if it wanted a chance to stave 
off the new sanctions. 
 
9. (C) The banker asked for an explanation of all of the 
pending sanctions, but did not seem surprised at our actions. 
 He asked us to keep him apprised of the changing situation, 
particularly as regards the asset freeze, as the two 
state-owned foreign trade banks (Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank 
and Myanmar Investment and Commercial Bank) both have some 
assets remaining in accounts at their U.S. correspondent 
banks.  He said that the bank had not noticed any slowdown in 
the number of Letters of Credit requests at the bank, but 
that he\'d heard several bank customers complaining of 
canceled export orders from the United States and Europe.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez.  Reason: 1.5 (d). 
 
 (C) 1. Summary: According to a report from a recently 
released inmate, conditions in Burma\'s Insein prison have 
deteriorated badly following the discovery of a microphone in 
a room being used by UN Special Rapporteur Pinheiro for 
interviews with inmates in March (reftel A).  The prison 
warden at Insein was replaced immediately following that 
incident and the new warden has imposed a new, and far 
harsher, regime which has rolled back many of the 
improvements introduced by ICRC since 1999.  TVs, newspapers 
and all writing materials and writing implements have been 
taken away, and socializing is strictly controlled.  Food, 
sanitation and health conditions remain poor, security has 
increased and prisoners are now regularly subjected to 
punishing physical exercises, and beaten.  Political 
prisoners are segregated from the general prison population, 
but there are indications that some may have been abused, 
including some who may have been in Aung San Suu Kyi\'s convoy 
on May 30.  We have passed a copy of the report to ICRC. 
They have confirmed that the warden at Insein Prison was 
replaced following the incident with Special Rapporteur 
Pinheiro.  They have also promised to investigate conditions 
at Insein when they next visit, probably in July. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The following is an edited version of the former 
inmate\'s report. 
 
The former inmate is not a political prisoner.  He was 
arrested by the police in August 2002 and was locked up in 
Insein prison until he was released on bail in March 2003. He 
met with ICRC during ICRC\'s prison visit in November 2002. 
After ICRC,s visit, the warden of Insein prison improved the 
facilities and arranged some entertainment programs for the 
prisoners.  The improved system lasted until March 2003, when 
the incident occurred with Special Rapporteur Pinheiro 
(reftel A). The authorities immediately changed the prison 
warden on the grounds that he had damaged the image of the 
government. 
 
The inmate was rearrested and sent back to the Insein prison 
in June 2003.  He found that the prison had changed totally. 
Security was much tighter.  He and other inmates were 
searched thoroughly, and the snacks he brought with him were 
taken away by the prison authorities.  He was also ordered to 
leave all papers, pens, books, and other items at the gate. 
On their first day, the new inmates were made to sit on the 
wet ground in the rain, while the new warden laid down the 
rules for prison operations.  In his speech, the warden told 
them that they were there because they are criminals and that 
the prison authorities would treat them like criminals.  The 
authorities did not care about ICRC, the warden said.  The 
world community may say the condition of this jail is poor 
but \"we do not care\" because this is prison --  a place to 
keep criminals like them.  The warden also warned that if 
inmates tell anyone about happenings within the prison, they 
will suffer severe punishment and will spend the rest of 
their life in the prison, regardless of their current 
sentences. 
 
The inmate said that all inmates are now obliged to fall in 
and perform &ponsan8 -- punishing physical exercises -- 
each morning.  This practice had been stopped following 
ICRC\'s visit November 2002, but was resumed in June.  If the 
inmates could not perform according to order, they were 
beaten with rough batons.  Since June 12, the new warden has 
also banned all TVs and newspapers from the prison. No 
prisoner is now allowed to carry a ball pen, a piece of paper 
or anything that can be used to write. 
 
Health and sanitation conditions are also poor.  Many inmates 
who suffer from communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, 
hepatitis B; etc. remain in the general prison population; 
they have not been segregated.  Toilets are in poor shape and 
little water is available for bathing.  Food is also poor. 
For lunch, inmates get a bowl of thin bean soup and a plate 
of rice. For dinner, they get a bowl of &Yay-Baw-Law,8 a 
kind of prison soup composed of herbs and vegetables found in 
the prison courtyard, a small portion of &Ngapi8 (fish 
paste - sometimes with &maggots8) and a plate of rice. The 
rice was generally full of crushed rice, husks and stones. 
Socializing has also been restricted.  There is no 
entertainment, all prison visits are monitored, and all 
packages brought to the prison are screened thoroughly by 
plain-clothes security personnel. The prison has also now 
forbidden inmates to sit or talk together in groups of more 
than four; any inmates found sitting together in larger 
groups are beaten. 
 
Political Prisoners 
 
Political prisoners are kept in a special barracks next to 
the barracks in which the inmate was kept.  The whole 
building is built of concrete and well protected by walls so 
that nobody can see the political prisoners and their 
activities. The barracks are divided into cells that can 
house two or three persons.  At present, however, there were 
8 to 10 persons in a cell.  Altogether, there are an 
estimated 230 inmates in the barracks for political 
prisoners.  The political prisoners\' barracks has a small 
courtyard and, unlike the other barracks, does have a bathing 
hall and a walking place where the political prisoners are 
allowed to walk in the early morning.  Occasionally inmates 
see political prisoners, in hoods to conceal their 
identities, dragged from the political prisoners barracks to 
the prison hospital.  On the third day of his detention, the 
inmate himself saw seven hooded prisoners dragged to the 
hospital by prison officials.  When he asked one of the 
prison guards who the prisoners were, he was told that they 
were the &problem makers who went along with Suu Kyi.8  He 
also heard that there is a special &bungalow8 next to the 
political prisoners\' barracks where Aung San Suu Kyi is 
supposed to be detained, but is not sure that that is true. 
(Note: However, this information correlates with reftel B, 
para. 2 regarding the special \"bungalow\" built for Aung San 
Suu Kyi within Insein.) The inmate also said that the prison 
wards are now watched not only by prison guards, but also 
plain clothes personnel. 
 
3. (C) Comment: We will have to wait until ICRC visits Insein 
before judging whether all the details in this report are 
accurate.  However, it does have the ring of truth.  It would 
make sense for the authorities to tighten security and 
discipline following the incident with Pinheiro.  That would 
be even more true if NLD members who were picked up following 
the attack in Depeyin were lodged at Insein.  Whatever the 
reason for the crackdown, however, it does appear that the 
GOB may have begun to roll back, at least at Insein prison, 
reforms encouraged by ICRC following its 1999 to 2002 prison 
visits.  If so, it would be one more setback for 
international efforts to improve human rights in Burma.  End

1.  (C)  Summary:  Pol/Econ chief, accompanied by a senior 
Burmese FSN, went to the residences of eight of the ten CEC 
members on June 26.  We found the security at the houses of 
the Central Committee members lax in contrast to 2000, when 
the GOB posted military intelligence agents (MI) and Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officers at the houses of the CEC 
members.  Any easing may have been a result of the GOB not 
believing that we would continue pressing to see the 
detainees in the face of continuing stonewalling by the 
government.  Continued visits by U.S. Embassy officials serve 
to keep not only the GOB, but also the democratic opposition, 
on notice that we will continue to protest what is happening 
here.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C)  As part of post\'s continuing efforts to gain access 
to members of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the 
National League for Democracy (NLD), Pol/Econ chief, 
accompanied by a senior Burmese FSN, went to the residences 
of eight of the ten CEC members on June 26.  The GOB 
continues to insist publicly they are not under arrest.  Our 
information, gleaned from loose-lipped guards at the gates, 
as well as from conversations with members of the detainees\' 
families, indicates otherwise.  In reality, the detainees are 
under house arrest under the provisions of Section 10 (b) of 
a 1975 law \"restraining\" them for up to year (Ref A - in 
practice they can be held as long as the GOB sees fit). 
 
3. (C)  We found the security at the houses of the Central 
Committee members lax in contrast to 2000, when the GOB 
posted military intelligence agents (MI) and Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officers at the houses of the CEC 
members.  The current security is also less than was in place 
in the first few days after the May 30 attack on ASSK and her 
followers in Depeyin, when MI and MOFA were very much in 
evidence when we were barred from entering the houses of 
detained CEC members (Ref B).  Currently, those same houses 
are being watched by low-level local government officials and 
USDA members. 
 
4. (C)  We did not get a chance to talk to the detained NLD 
leaders, although several looked out from the windows of 
their houses.  We did talk to members of the households of 
several of the detainees and were told that family members 
are being allowed to go in and out of the residences.  From 
the information we gathered from the relatives, it seems the 
detainees are in relatively good health and are allowed 
visits from physicians.  To judge from the reactions of the 
family members, these latest visits were welcome, just as 
before (Ref C).  We will continue these visits as part of our 
ongoing efforts (Ref D) to remind the GOB and the democratic 
opposition, in a public way, that the USG\'s support for the 
NLD  is still strong. 
 
5. (C)  We took this opportunity to deliver invitations to 
the CEC members for post\'s upcoming Independence Day 
reception, and we were able to leave the invitations with 
members of the household in all but one case.  Post was 
amused to see the French press release announcing that they 
have invited Aung San Suu Kyi and the other detained NLD 
leaders to their Bastille Day ceremony on July 14.  In fact, 
the French have passed their Bastille Day invitations to the 
CEC and ASSK to us for delivery and we will try to deliver 
them next week.  Hopefully, the French will come along. 
 
6. (C)  Comment: The apparent slight easing of security and 
permitting family members access to the detained CEC members 
should not be taken as a sign that detainees will be released 
any time soon.  Any easing may have been a result of the GOB 
not believing that we would continue pressing to see the 
detainees in the face of continuing stonewalling by the 
government.  However, continued visits by U.S. Embassy 
officials serve to keep not only the GOB, but also the 
democratic opposition, on notice that we will continue to 
protest what is happening here.  End Comment.

Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The input on pending U.S. sanctions on 
Burma continues to roll in.  In the last several days we\'ve 
heard the fears and concerns of the largest U.S. investor in 
Burma, Unocal, and also from 28,000 garment workers.  End 
summary. 
 
Unocal Sees Unintended Consequences 
 
2. (SBU) The Chief of Mission met with a local Unocal 
representative on June 25 to hear the largest U.S. investor 
in Burma\'s concerns over the intended, and possible 
unintended, consequences of the proposed new Burma sanctions. 
 Unocal was most concerned that the remittance and travel 
bans, if applied without any exceptions for pre-existing 
business operations, could lead to an untenable operating 
situation for the energy company.  The Unocal rep hinted that 
these sanctions could force the company to reconsider its 
investment stake in Burma if it were not grandfathered. 
 
3. (C) The unintended negative consequences of a Unocal 
divestment would be at least three-fold.  First, the company 
would have to sell out to another energy firm -- many of 
whom, including China\'s national oil company, are snooping 
around looking to farm into an existing development -- paying 
a 40 percent Burmese capital gains tax on the sale directly 
into the regime\'s coffers.  Though the Unocal official could 
not offhand tell us how much the gains would likely be, or in 
what form the payment would be made, he made it clear that 
this would be pure profit for the Burmese government. 
Second, of the likely new investors, except for current 
partner Total, none would put up the amount of money 
currently spent by Unocal for social and economic development 
in its pipeline zone (see Ref B).  Third, there is the 
prospect of Chinese influence over a large portion of 
Thailand\'s natural gas imports if the Chinese national oil 
company took over Unocal\'s position. 
 
4. (SBU) Perhaps a bit prematurely, the Unocal official also 
told us the firm\'s concerns about sanctions not yet under 
consideration.  He said any expansion of a trade ban to 
include U.S. exports to Burma would be extremely damaging to 
Unocal\'s platform and pipeline operations.  Several key parts 
are imported from the United States, and not easily 
substituted.  If one of these parts went down, and importing 
a replacement was illegal, the pipeline, which carries 
significant volumes of natural gas to Thailand, might have to 
slow or stop its operations temporarily.  The result of this, 
the rep explained, would be \"the lights going out in parts of 
Bangkok.\" 
 
Garment Workers Speak Out 
 
5. (SBU) We were visited on July 3rd by a delegation from the 
Burmese Garment Manufacturers Association (GMA) and the Union 
of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(UMFCCI).  The delegation presented a letter to President 
Bush urging him to veto the proposed import ban legislation 
(faxed to EAP/BCLTV).  Attached to this letter were two large 
boxes filled with petitions, signed by 28,000 garment workers 
from factories in the Rangoon area.  Apparently the GMA went 
to its members and asked them to explain to their workers the 
likely impact of import ban legislation on their livelihood. 
After this the petitions were made available for signature. 
The delegation assured us that this was done on a totally 
voluntary basis, with no coercion.  Though there\'s no way to 
verify this, there\'s no reason to believe that any force 
would be needed to get the signatures. 
 
6. (SBU) We agreed to forward the letter to Washington and 
keep the GMA apprised of the progress of the legislation. 
However, we also urged the GMA and UMFCCI to use their 
lobbying and organizing ability to bring the message to the 
SPDC that only political change could turn the tide for their 
factories and workers.  The delegation laughed and said 
simply, \"Not possible.\"

Dear Mr. Secretary-General 
 
Subject:  The Disgraceful Situation in Burma after the Crisis 
at Da-Ba-Yin Township 
 
In the evening of May 30, 2003 some members of the National 
League for Democracy (NLD) including U Tin Oo, Vice Chairman 
and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, General Secretary while traveling 
on an organizational tour were savagely attacked by a group 
of thugs between Kyi village and Da Ba Yin town in Sagaing 
Division resulting in several deaths and injuring hundreds of 
NLD members.  The government has not clarified nor provided 
details of the above event. 
 
Moreover, it is learnt that U Tin Oo, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi 
and the youths who accompanied them on the journey were 
seriously harmed and are also held under detention without 
any legal ground. 
 
Hence the undersigned, the representatives who were duly 
elected at the Multiparty Election held in 1990, on behalf of 
the people of Burma, have sent a letter of protest to Senior 
General Than Shwe, Chairman of the State Peace and 
Development Council, calling for:- 
 
(1) Immediate release of U Tin Oo, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and 
all others who were arrested at the site of the crisis. 
(2) Unconditional release of U Aung Shwe, Chairman and other 
Central Executive members of NLD who are kept under house 
arrest since May 31, 2003. 
(3) Reopening of all NLD offices sealed by the government and 
resuming of legal political party functions. 
(4) Official independent investigation and statement of facts 
regarding the events including the number of deaths, wounded, 
missing and detained persons. 
(5) Compliance and implementation of the Resolutions and 
Recommendations of the General Assembly, the Security Council 
and other Agencies of the United Nations. 
 
The above demands are made for the people of Burma as well as 
for the whole community of the world.  We firmly believe that 
the current impasse in this country is not only a disgrace to 
the Nation but is also becoming a threat to the peace and 
security of the whole region. 
 
Attached herewith a copy of the abovementioned letter in 
Burmese version with a humble request that the case should be 
brought to the notice of the Security Council for necessary 
action. 
 
Yours sincerely,

1. (S)  Summary: Reverend Saboi Jum, the head of the Kachin 
Baptist Convention, has revealed plans by ethnic leaders to 
appeal directly to the head of the SPDC for a return to the 
path of national reconciliation. Jum asked COM if the release 
of Aung San Suu Kyi alone  would be enough to ease US 
pressure on the junta. COM told Jum that the release of Aung 
San Suu Kyi was important, but not enough to ease USG 
pressure for release of all political prisoners, improved 
human rights for all Burmese, and credible signs of 
commitment to a transition to democracy. Given Jum\'s 
closeness to the SPDC\'s Secretary One Khin Nyunt, it was an 
excellent opportunity to reinforce the USG message. End 
Summary. 
 
2. (S) Reverend Saboi Jum, the head of the Kachin Baptist 
Convention and one of the most respected ethnic leaders in 
Burma met with COM and DCM on July 9.  Jum and his brother, 
Hkun Myat (a businessman) are both very close to the number 
three man in the SPDC, Secretary One, General Khin Nyunt. 
(Note: Jum played a vital part in negotiating the Kachin 
cease-fire agreement, as did Khin Nyunt. Hkun Myat also 
assisted in mediating cease-fire agreements with Karenni, Mon 
and Karen insurgent groups. End Note) 
 
3. (S) Jum\'s stated purpose at the meeting was to reveal 
plans by ethnic leaders to appeal directly to Senior General 
Than Shwe (head of the ruling SPDC junta) for a return to the 
path of national reconciliation.  Jum said that a decision 
was taken by group of ethnic leaders earlier this month to 
draft a letter to Senior General Than Shwe appealing to him 
to allow renewed political activity on the part of the NLD, a 
release of political prisoners, and the release of Aung San 
Suu Kyi. 
 
4. (S) Jum said the letter would be given to Than Shwe on 
July 19, Martyrs Day (commemorating the assassination of 
General Aung San - Burma\'s national hero and the father of 
Aung San Suu Kyi).  Jum said he was confident the letter 
would actually be delivered to Than Shwe, as Jum is very 
close to a monk that is a personal aide to the Senior 
General.  (Jum said he would provide COM with a copy of the 
letter.) 
 
5. (S) Jum asked if the USG\'s tough position on trade 
sanctions and punitive measures against the regime could be 
softened by the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.  He specifically 
asked, \"So, if they release Aung San Suu Kyi, would that be 
enough for the United States?\"  COM told Jum that the release 
of ASSK was extremely important and should take place 
immediately, but that the USG remained committed to the 
resolution of the even larger problem of the SPDC\'s failure 
to live up to its stated commitment to national 
reconciliation.  The COM told Jum that the USG would not ease 
up its pressure for release of all political prisoners, 
improved human rights for all Burmese and credible signs of 
commitment to a transition to democracy. 
 
6. (S) Comment: We feel strongly that Jum was on a mission 
from not just the ethnic leaders re the planned appeal to 
Than Shwe, but also from Khin Nyunt.  Jum seemed disappointed 
by COM\'s response to his question regarding the \"softening\" 
effect ASSK\'s release would have on the USG\'s toughening 
Burma policy.  Given Jum\'s closeness to Secretary One, it was 
an excellent opportunity to reinforce the USG message via 
this channel.  End Comment.

REF: RANGOON 560 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The situation for some of Burma\'s largest 
private banks may have stabilized for the time being, though 
it is still critical.  The government, despite some tinkering 
around the edges, has still not revealed its vision for the 
future.  We\'re sure of only two things: the economy will limp 
along without causing political discontent, and there will be 
some shell of a private banking sector at the end of the 
tunnel.  End summary. 
 
Banking Situation: A Move out of ICU? 
 
2. (C) The government has done little in the past several 
months to definitively resolve the predicament of the 
nation\'s private banking sector.  Private bankers tell us 
that they are still required to report nightly to the 
government\'s Private Bank Management Committee detailed 
information on that day\'s withdrawals, transfers, and loan 
repayments.  Despite this regular interaction between bankers 
and regulators, there are apparently no discussions or 
consultations on root problems or next steps.  The government 
has not moved beyond its March instructions to banks: collect 
all outstanding loans, bad or good, to repay depositors. 
 
 
3. (C) Despite this uncertain situation, two bankers with 
whom we spoke said that their banks (both in the top six by 
deposits) had stabilized, though their condition was still 
critical.  With the current restrictions in place, recovery 
and normal operations were not possible.  These two banks 
were not extending new credit or taking new deposits, 
allegedly on the instruction of the Bank Management 
Committee.  However, the two banks had paid out between 50-65 
percent of their deposits and recovered around 50-60 percent 
of outstanding loans.  With this, each bank had about an 
equal amount of remaining deposits and loans trickling in and 
out.  This tenuous balance was being padded by fees earned 
from a recovering demand for intrabank transfers, now about 
40 percent of pre-crisis levels at one large bank, and 
savings from expanding layoffs and asset sales.  The two 
bankers said they thought this basic stability was the case 
for the other major private banks as well.  However, other 
sources have told us that Yoma Bank, the country\'s second 
largest private bank, was suffering more serious liquidity 
problems because of difficulties getting loans repaid. 
 
Government\'s Response: Bad Medicine? 
 
4. (C) In early June the Central Bank took steps to tighten 
practices supposedly being abused by private banks.  First, 
the Central Bank informed all private banks that as of 
October 1 they would have to repay or transfer to another 
type of account all call deposit accounts.  These call 
deposit accounts were popular with banks, and depositors, as 
they offered an annual 4-10 percent interest rate, compounded 
daily, with no restrictions on withdrawals.  A banking source 
said these accounts were used by banks to entice inflows of 
\"hot\" money to mask poor liquidity ratios.  A second move by 
the Central Bank raised the interest rate for outstanding 
Central Bank credit lines immediately from 11 percent to 13 
percent, and demanded repayment of outstanding credit lines 
ASAP.  Again, regulators suspected banks were abusing their 
lines of credit, with the lower interest rate, to paper over 
structural problems and fuel irresponsible lending. 
 
5. (C) Though both of these moves are sensible, their 
promulgation at this sensitive time, and with no accompanying 
assistance or reforms, may cause further hardship to the 
larger private banks, which hold more call deposits and 
Central Bank credit.  According to statistics, Asia Wealth 
Bank (the country\'s largest) has an outstanding 15 billion 
kyat (about $15 million) line of credit with the Central 
Bank.  Yoma, Kanbawza Bank, and Myanmar Overseas Bank hold 5 
billion, 5 billion, and 1.5 billion kyat respectively. 
 
6. (C)  Despite its latest marginal actions, the government 
has yet to release a new set of guidelines explaining the 
future of the private banking sector.  There\'s been no major 
new directive since March, when the government refused to 
bail out the banks and demanded that borrowers immediately 
repay their loans.  For several months bankers and economists 
have been predicting that these new guidelines will come 
\"next month.\"  However, to date there\'s been nothing firm, 
only rumors that the Bank Management Committee had given an 
extra three to six months for banks to recover their 
outstanding loans and rebuild their capital base with cash, 
or other very liquid assets.  After that, the rumor goes, the 
government will issue clean bills of health to those banks 
that have met the challenge, and dispose, somehow, of those 
that haven\'t.  The future is uncertain even for those that 
make the cut, though, with additional rumors that the Central 
Bank will merge these banks with government or 
semi-government banks, or hang stringent new operating 
requirements on survivors.  There is speculation that all new 
loans will have to get Central Bank approval, and that 
paid-in capital requirements will be much higher. 
 
Business Community Down, But Not Out 
 
7. (C) The business community has found a way to get along 
for five months without a reliable private banking sector. 
Though bankers report that they are no longer helping out 
employers with large withdrawals to meet payroll, business 
community leaders say that most companies are getting by 
through diversification, the sale of assets, laying off of 
workers, or cutting salaries.  The informal domestic 
financial network is also helping by picking up some of the 
slack for credit and fund transfers.  The availability of 
intrabank transfers is also keeping commerce from collapsing 
entirely.  Diversified companies, those with access to black 
market money or lucrative government contracts (government 
banks are still operating without difficulty) are also better 
able to weather the economic storm. 
 
8. (C) Also helping the sluggish economy is a relatively 
stable inflation rate, brought to heel because of the 
economic slowdown and reduction in both money supply and 
circulation caused by the banking meltdown.  The monthly 
consumer price index declined three out of the last five 
months, and held stable in the other two.  The unintended 
consequences of the crisis and the government\'s reaction have 
also kept the kyat stable against the dollar, defying 
pre-crash expectations that the kyat\'s depreciation would 
continue unabated. 
 
Throw Away the Crystal Ball 
 
9. (C) Prognostication on the banking situation is often a 
fool\'s errand.  However, we draw two conclusions after five 
months.  First, the banking crisis has caused an economic 
slowdown and layoffs, but there will be no resulting 
political upheaval.  The informal economy and people\'s 
general tolerance for economic misfortune have softened the 
blows.  Second, when the situation is finally resolved, there 
will be a private banking sector of some shape and size. 
However, some important questions that remain are: How many 
banks will be liquidated/merged?  How independent will the 
survivors be? and perhaps most importantly, Will a critical 
mass of customers come back to the revived banks and risk 
losing their money once again?

SUBJECT: BURMA: HUNDI MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND 
 
REF: A. RANGOON 846 AND PREVIOUS 
 
     B. RANGOON 30 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (S) Summary: In the absence of a reliable method for 
remitting foreign exchange, the \"hundi\" system flourishes in 
Burma.  The system is used by nearly everyone in the country 
who needs to get dollars in or out, from NGOs to military 
officers.  Though hundi in Burma is undoubtedly used to 
facilitate drug trafficking, we\'ve no evidence to date that 
it\'s being used to finance terrorism or anti-American groups 
in Burma.  End summary. 
 
Never Did Trust Those Banks 
 
2. (U) Though hundi is best known in Burma as a way to send 
and receive foreign exchange without dealing with burdensome 
and extortionate regulations, the system is also fairly well 
established as a way for buyers and sellers to move kyat 
around the country.  This latter system has been 
reinvigorated since the decline of the private banking system 
this year. 
 
3. (U) The international hundi system in Burma has been alive 
and well since the Socialist era (1962-88) when no private 
banking existed, and locals were not allowed to hold any 
foreign currency.  Burmese working abroad (especially 
merchant seamen) availed themselves regularly of hundi as 
they were legally obliged to remit their dollars to family 
members\' accounts at government banks.  Account holders could 
withdraw the money, but only in kyat at the overvalued 
official 6 kyat/dollar rate. 
 
4. (U) The SPDC (nee SLORC) takeover in 1988, ostensibly 
ushered in a new era of \"market reforms,\" where private 
companies, organizations, and individuals who earned foreign 
exchange were allowed to open foreign exchange accounts at 
the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank and the Myanmar Investment and 
Commercial Bank.  However, in a typically counterintuitive 
policy, Burmese nationals were still prohibited from holding 
foreign exchange.  When the Foreign Exchange Certificate 
(FEC) was introduced in 1993, Burmese nationals were allowed 
to withdraw their foreign exchange in that form.  However, at 
market rates the FEC is worth about 10-40 percent less than 
the still proscribed greenback.  Furthermore, the government 
takes an automatic 10 percent tax off the top of any foreign 
exchange deposits. 
 
How Does it Work? 
 
5. (SBU) Dealers in transnational hundi operate in a similar 
fashion to their American counterparts.  A Burmese expatriate 
or foreign business person in Rangoon will approach a dealer 
to have their dollars transferred to the dealer\'s counterpart 
at the other end of the network.  The dealers will arrange 
with their counterpart some verification method to ensure the 
right person gets the transferred funds.  Money arriving in 
Burma via hundi is paid out in kyat, at a market-based 
exchange rate.  The settlement of the dealers\' accounts of 
either end of the transaction can occur in many ways, 
depending on whether the relationship of the dealers is 
familial or business. 
 
6. (SBU) Hundi dealers operating in Burma are widespread and 
can be part of a large, global, family network or merely a 
one-man operation.  Local brokers tend to work as money 
changers, gold or gem merchants, traders, or travel agents. 
Hundi is also run on occasion by individuals out of their 
homes.  The hundi network in Burma is found primarily in the 
Chinatown section of Rangoon, along the Thai and Chinese 
borders, and in the country\'s commercial hub Mandalay.  The 
system is clearly illegal, violating the government\'s very 
strict foreign exchange control regulations. 
 
7. (SBU) Hundi operators in Burma rely on both direct and 
hub-and-spoke transfers of cash, depending on how large their 
particular network is.  One of the larger family-based 
networks has affiliates in Rangoon, Mandalay, Chiang Mai, 
Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Kunming, and San Francisco. 
Smaller brokers, or those without ties, will use Bangkok or 
Singapore as hubs to get money forwarded all over the world. 
Though Burmese migrant workers in the Middle East also use 
the hundi system, we\'ve heard no allegations of major hundi 
operators in Rangoon with direct ties to those countries. 
 
8. (SBU) Hundi dealers earn fees in three primary ways, and 
often in combination.  First, they might take a percentage of 
the transaction -- usually around 5 to 6 percent.  A second 
option is for the dealer to offer a skewed exchange rate and 
rake in the difference.  Finally, the user and dealer might 
cut some side business deal. 
9. (SBU) Businessmen complain that the Burmese transnational 
hundi system is expensive, and not always run by honest 
brokers.  However, they admit that businesses and individuals 
have little choice when they need to get cash overseas. 
Since there is no legal recourse if a dealer doesn\'t hold up 
his end of the bargain, hundi dealers are known to abscond 
from time to time with the money with which they have been 
entrusted.  Rumors that a hundi dealer along the Chinese 
border had disappeared with millions of dollars worth of Asia 
Wealth Bank\'s (AWB) wealth helped spark the initial run on 
that bank, and the subsequent general banking crisis, in 
February 2003. 
 
10. (SBU) Dishonesty in the Burmese hundi system is fueled by 
a number of country-specific ingredients.  First is the 
users\' lack of legal alternatives to transfer funds overseas. 
 Second, someone intent on stealing a \"shipment\" of foreign 
exchange in cash poor Burma, would need only one large score 
to ensure a comfortable underground retirement.  Finally, 
Burma\'s convoluted economic system encourages patronage, 
corruption, \"working the system,\" and making a quick buck. 
Thus, making a killing in the underground hundi market makes 
as much sense to a budding \"entrepreneur\" as trading in cell 
phones or presenting fraudulent import invoices. 
 
Who\'s Using Hundi? 
 
11. (C) Over the past decade, the expansion of Burma\'s 
international trade, the slow but steady intrickle of 
international NGOs and small investors, and the continuing 
disincentives to use the formal system have allowed hundi to 
flourish.  It is impossible to know exactly how much flows in 
and out through this illegal, and thus very private, system. 
However, we\'ve heard estimates from knowledgeable sources 
that from $600-800 million per year comes into the country, 
and at least $600 million streams out.  This is notable in 
contrast to the IMF\'s CY 2002 estimates of $470 million in 
foreign exchange reserves, and $1 billion in total money 
supply. 
 
-- Burmese seamen and expatriates use hundi to remit dollars 
to their economically ravaged families.  It\'s estimated that 
50,000 Burmese are working overseas now (15,000 are seamen). 
 
-- Exporters, faced with a 10 percent tax on export earnings, 
often underinvoice and instruct their overseas buyers to 
deposit the difference informally into offshore bank accounts 
(usually in Singapore).  These traders then use the hundi 
system to repatriate this money from their offshore accounts 
when they need to convert their dollars to kyat. 
 
-- Importers, who must have offsetting export income for all 
imports, also often underinvoice to maximize the amount they 
can bring in or to avoid customs duties and other taxes.  The 
importers then settle the difference with their overseas 
sellers informally using hundi.  It\'s been alleged that the 
government turns a blind eye to this use of hundi for large 
corporations involved in priority construction projects. 
 
-- Foreign investors and international NGOs use hundi to get 
money into the country, evading the 10 percent tax on foreign 
exchange deposited the government banks.  By avoiding the 
banks, investors and NGOs also evade the requirement of 
withdrawing their foreign exchange deposits in FEC.  Though 
it would be possible for local Muslim charities to use the 
hundi system to bring funds into the country, we have no 
evidence that they are doing so. 
-- Wealthy individuals in Burma use hundi to illegally 
expatriate their hidden dollar assets and/or send money to 
children living and studying overseas.  The student visa 
function here is complicated as even the wealthiest 
prospective student\'s ability to pay for schooling often 
defies documentation requirements. 
 
Guns, Drugs, and Terror? 
 
12. (C) Because the hundi system in Burma is widespread with 
many small-scale operators, it can be easily used for 
nefarious purposes.  Though authorities keep an eye on the 
larger hundi dealers, it is very difficult for them to 
consistently crack down on all dealers.  There is also the 
question of conflict of interest.  Military Intelligence (MI) 
is charged with keeping an eye on the hundi and black market 
currency exchange dealers (usually the same people) to 
enforce currency laws, adjust the dollar/kyat exchange rate, 
and monitor significant inflows of foreign exchange destined 
for anyone affiliated with known insurgents or other 
\"destructionists.\"  However, these same MI officials are 
often making money from this same hundi system, either as 
operators or by taking bribes from operators.  Furthermore, 
MI, and other government officials to the highest levels, 
rely on these hundi/currency exchange dealers, just like 
everyone else, for their services. 
 
13. (C) We have evidence that the hundi system in Burma is 
used to facilitate the narcotics trade.  For example, drug 
traffickers in Thailand or Hong Kong will send funds via 
hundi into Burma to pay the local suppliers or producers. 
However, dealers involved in this type of hundi are more 
often than not guilty only of a sin of ignorance.  Dealers 
rarely explore the source of the funds flowing through their 
shops or the backgrounds of their customers. 
 
14. (S) We\'ve no evidence that the hundi system here is being 
used for external financing of any terrorist network.  While 
the potential is there should such a network emerge in Burma, 
we think the chances are relatively slim.  Though MI\'s 
involvement in the hundi system creates a certain amount of 
moral hazard, and the risk is always present of an individual 
MI officer taking a bribe to turn the other way on a 
dangerous transaction, we believe MI\'s shadowy presence in 
hundi, and Burmese people\'s instinctive fear of MI scrutiny, 
would dissuade most provocateurs from trying to funnel in 
large sums using hundi.  Funding for any potential terrorist 
activity is much more likely to come in via courier; also an 
easy proposition considering the porous borders, often 
outside government control, and notoriously venal customs and 
regional military officers.

SUBJECT: MP\'S-ELECT SHARE THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1.  (S) Summary:  MPs-elect told us July 18 that they expect 
Aung San Suu Kyi to be released fairly soon, that the party 
remains strong and its members dedicated and loyal, and that 
they hope to avoid any \"sporadic\" anti-regime action that 
could serve as a pretext for an even tougher crackdown on the 
pro-democracy movement.  If and when the NLD acts, the MPs 
continued, it would be on a coordinated, nation-wide basis. 
The British Embassy here has heard talk of NLD plans to 
declare a parallel government.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S) Emboffs, accompanied by a British diplomat, met in 
Rangoon July 18 with five Members of Parliament Elect (i.e., 
elected in the junta-annulled 1990 election).  Four are 
provincial-level NLD leaders and one is a member of the Party 
for National Democracy (the party of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s first 
cousin and prime minister of the NCGUB, Dr. Sein Win).  Two 
of the five were recently released from detention after being 
arrested in the post-May 30th crackdown on the NLD.  A brief 
recap of significant points follows: 
 
-- They do not expect ASSK will be imprisoned for a long 
period, as international and domestic pressure is building on 
the regime to release her. 
 
-- The local party members remain dedicated and \"are willing 
to gather and strike if we ask them.\" 
 
-- The party has yet to take any concerted action, as the 
members await direction from its leaders.  \"We have pledged 
ourselves to Aung San Suu Kyi and U Aung Shwe and would not 
want to do anything against their wishes.\" 
 
-- If, however, ASSK and U Aung Shwe are not soon released, 
the provincial-level leadership will meet to coordinate 
national policy. 
 
-- They say any anti-regime action must be national and 
coordinated.  They fear that sporadic violence, particularly 
in Rangoon or Mandalay, could spark an even harsher military 
crackdown on democracy supporters. 
 
-- The SPDC claims ASSK provoked the \"clash\" of May 30th and 
planned some violence in Rangoon in an attempt to spur a 
general uprising, they explained.  The MPs-elect are 
concerned that some student hotheads may play into the SPDC\'s 
hands by undertaking scattered violent acts. 
 
-- Overall, the MPs said they welcomed the events since May 
30th, as they might prove to be a catalyst for positive 
change.  One of those recently released said somewhat 
ruefully, \"Experience can be a wonderful teacher, but lately 
the school fees have been very high.\" 
 
3. (C) The British diplomat afterwards told us she had heard 
from other MPs-elect that some MPs-elect are considering 
announcing a parallel government.  (We have heard the same, 
but only third-hand.)  She added that in her recent 
discussions with Thailand-based anti-regime youths, it is 
apparent that some leaders are pressing for direct action and 
now reject any hope of resumed \"dialogue.\"  These young 
people have taken heart \"from the language of the bill your 
Congress just passed,\" she said. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: We note that the Burmese Freedom and 
Democracy Act includes the sentence, \"The policy of the 
United States, as articulated by the President on April 24, 
2003, is to officially recognize the NLD as the legitimate 
representative of the Burmese people as determined by the 
1990 election.\"  We will seek to provide measured advice to 
any MPs-elect who might be considering declaring a parallel 
government on the basis of this or other statements.  End 
Comment.

1. (U) This is an action request.  See para 2. 
 
2.  (SBU) Summary:  In order to expand its democracy training 
and outreach, Embassy proposes to establish an American 
Center Teaching Annex in Mandalay (see reftels), Burma\'s 
second largest city and its geographic and cultural center. 
The American Center Teaching Annex would enable post to 
include significantly larger numbers of those supporting 
political change in these regions in public diplomacy 
outreach programs fostering democracy and civil society, a 
core MPP goal.  The most recent GOB crackdown on opposition 
parties throws into stark relief the need and utility of 
another outreach channel to those organizations and 
individuals. 
 
An OIG team visiting post in February applauded post,s plans 
to expand outreach beyond the capital.  Among its draft key 
judgments:  \"The (Public Diplomacy) section continues to make 
significant strides in its outreach efforts and conducts a 
highly successful educational program in Rangoon.\"  The OIG 
recommended that Post provide for the Department an analysis 
of alternatives for establishing an outreach center in 
Mandalay. 
 
Post herein offers an assessment of three possible options 
for the establishment of the Mandalay outreach center: 
 
A) Opening an American Center Teaching Annex in USG-owned 
property: Utilize former Mandalay Consulate property for the 
Center and begin the program with four FSNs and two AmCit 
grantees; 
 
B) Leasing the USG property to an Educational NGO to perform 
outreach programs under a grant agreement: Have an American 
educational NGO provide program activities similar to Public 
Diplomacy programs at the USG-owned property; and 
 
C) Opening an American Center Teaching Annex as a Tenant in 
Commercial Space: Rent commercial space in Mandalay, sell the 
USG-owned property, and begin the program with four FSNs and 
two AmCit grantees. 
 
Funding would need to come from a variety of sources, but 
could include ESF from the \"Burma Earmark\" for democracy 
programs.  In making this assessment, site visits to Mandalay 
were conducted by the COM, DCM, PAO, GSO, and RSO, as well as 
by two DS Regional Security Engineers, an OBO architect, and 
the OIG team. 
 
ACTION REQUEST:  that the Department review the options and 
select which, if any, it deems most appropriate and name a 
point of contact to work with Post to implement the proposal. 
 End Summary. 
 
THE NEED FOR AN AMERICAN CENTER TEACHING ANNEX, MANDALAY 
 
3. (SBU) Even before the May 30 ambush on Aung San Suu Kyi\'s 
motorcade and the subsequent arrests of hundreds of democracy 
supporters, Burma was a country subject to Orwellian 
censorship and control by the military dictatorship.  There 
is no free press, free speech, or right of assembly.  The 
universities, historically a source of political activism, 
have been virtually dismantled by the regime.  Graduating 
high school students must wait more than a year before space 
opens for them in a university \"distance learning\" program. 
Thus, at precisely the time they are making life decisions 
and are perhaps most open to influence, thousands of young 
adults are turning to the American Center in Rangoon each 
month to use the Library/Information Resource Center (IRC), 
attend films or lectures, or join English language classes. 
These English language classes have a high content of civil 
society training, such as critical thinking, expressing 
opinions and persuading others, mediating disputes and 
conflicts, etc.  A number of the students in the English 
language classes are former political prisoners, or 
representatives of opposition political parties or minority 
ethnic groups, who have been granted tuition waivers for the 
classes. 
 
4. (C) For the past year, through an ESF Burma Earmark grant, 
post has been providing governance training and English 
classes (eight hours a week) for seven to twelve opposition 
leaders.  The program was begun at the request of opposition 
leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the participants are her 
hand-picked representatives -- predominantly MP\'s elected in 
1990, but never seated -- her shadow Ministers and successors 
to the aging party leadership.  Because of the importance of 
this program to ASSK, she asked that the training be 
continued for a second year.  During the first year of the 
program, ASSK also sought to include party leaders and MP\'s 
from other provinces.  A group of three Mandalay MP\'s moved 
to Rangoon for two six week sessions, but were unable to keep 
up with the main cohort because they could not be away for 
long from party responsibilities in Mandalay.  Another group 
including a Shan, a Mon, and a Karen party member were able 
to come for just one session.  A clear benefit to 
establishing a public diplomacy facility in Mandalay would be 
to extend activities like this high priority (but stealth) 
training program to NLD leadership in Mandalay and 
neighboring states and divisions.  This is one reason ASSK 
herself has endorsed establishing an American Center Teaching 
Annex in Mandalay. 
 
5. (C) The enthusiastic reception ASSK received in Mandalay 
and neighboring divisions, which led directly to the SPDC\'s 
dastardly May 30 ambush and crackdown on the National League 
for Democracy party leadership, demonstrates that there is a 
groundswell of popular support for political change in these 
regions.  All offices of the NLD (the only place party 
members can legally assemble) have been closed.  If the GOB 
experimentation with a longer leash for the opposition 
parties is indeed over, and the NLD\'s freedom of activity is 
curtailed, their ability to operate in the Mandalay region 
and beyond will be severely restrained.  Post can best aid 
democratization efforts, and our core MPP goal of a return to 
democracy, by increasing the capacity (widening the pipeline) 
to deliver training and information about the outside world 
to these supporters of political change. 
 
6. (SBU) The American Center Teaching Annex in Mandalay need 
not be an open-ended commitment.  In the period before 
democracy returns to Burma, and in the transition period, it 
would be in a unique position to provide valuable training 
for civil society organizations, particularly the democratic 
opposition.  Once democracy returns, the USG could 
investigate deeding the facility and its apparatus to a local 
institution as a democracy think tank or an American Studies 
Institute, as was done with many USIS libraries during the 
1990\'s. 
 
OPTION A  OPENING AN AMERICAN CENTER ANNEX IN USG-OWNED 
PROPERTY (FORMER MANDALAY CONSULATE) 
 
7. (SBU) Reftel A provided post,s rationale for opening an 
American Center Annex at the former consulate building 
Mandalay.  Reftels B and C, reported on the RSO,s security 
survey of the site and on probable costs associated with 
opening an American Center Annex there. 
 
8. (SBU) To recap, under Option A, the Teaching Annex would 
be staffed by a combination of LES (4) in the 
Library/Information Resource Center, and English 
teachers/trainers (2) hired through a grant agreement, with 
supervision from the PAO in Rangoon.  The former Consulate 
building offers approximately 3700 square feet well 
configured to function as a small American Center.  It could 
include two teaching classrooms and a language/computer lab 
in the upstairs rooms, and a Library reading room, reference 
section, and office space in the downstairs rooms.  An OBO 
architect, concluding a site visit in May, reported: \"The 
property is in excellent condition and would be well-suited 
for use as an American Center,\" citing the building\'s 
excellent location, accessibility, and setback. 
 
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS 
9. (SBU) The RSO determined (see Ref B) that the building is 
&in good to excellent condition8 has &excellent setback 
and reasonably effective safe area/office complex.8  &Basic 
structures are fundamentally sound and could be made 
operational with appropriate upgrades and DS exceptions to 
specific standards.8 
 
10. (SBU) According to 12 FAH-6, H-020, Definition of Terms 
the Annex would be a Public Office Facility. (\"Facility, 
which exists for public use or functions, such as libraries 
and cultural centers.  It is located in a commercial or 
residential building not collocated with the chancery or 
consulate.  No classified material is maintained.  U.S. 
Government may or may not be sole occupant.\")  Thus it would 
be governed by the physical security standards for \"Public 
Office Facilities\" as provided by regulation 12 FAH-6, 
H-111.8, Physical Security (Public Office Facilities - Such 
as Libraries and Commercial Offices). 
 
11. (SBU) The current property was acquired prior to 1991 and 
therefore falls in the category of an Existing Office 
Building, 12 FAH-5, H-111, Differentiation Between Existing 
and New Buildings; 12FAH-5, H-112, Existing Office Building 
(EOB).  Thus, no waiver for collocation or setback is 
required, according to SECCA, 1999, A.1, 00 State 82682.  (\"A 
quick reference checklist for waiver requirements involving 
building collocation and setback follows: A. No waiver 
required: 1) Existing U.S. diplomatic facilities as of 29 
November 1999....\") 
 
12. (SBU) If this option is chosen, RSO is ready to prepare a 
formal Site Survey and Security Upgrade Plan for the facility 
utilizing 12 FAH-5 and 12 FAH-6 as specific guidelines. 
These reports would provide DS the exact site layout, 
recommended security upgrades, and define those physical 
security standards that are not feasible as defined per 
regulation.  This would satisfy the requirement of 12 FAH-5, 
H-121.2, Exceptions to Standards, and serve as the 
documentation to support a funding request for security 
upgrades, 12 FAH-5, H-121.1, Applicability. 
 
FUNDING CONSIDERATIONS 
13. (SBU) Reftel C discussed post,s estimates of funding 
needs for this option.  Post estimated approximately $200,000 
in non-recurring expenses and about $95,000 in recurring 
costs, including salaries for locally engaged staff.  English 
teachers/trainers would be recruited through a grant to an 
educational NGO, at additional cost.  (A similar grant 
arrangement using Burma Earmark ESF is under consideration 
this fiscal year to assist the Rangoon American Center\'s 
English Teaching Program.) 
14. (SBU) In Ref D, AID indicated to State Desk Officer its 
estimation, after consultation with its Legal office, that of 
the $295,000 post estimated would be needed for year one, 
most could be covered by ESF.  (This may include costs for 
furnishings, computers and telecommunications, generator, 
electrical upgrade and maintenance costs, program materials, 
books, janitorial, grounds keeping, utilities, and fuel.) 
 
15. (SBU) AID advised that non-project costs, such as raising 
the perimeter fence and providing security guards, could not 
be allocated to ESF.  Funds for this, which post estimated at 
$45,000, will need to be found elsewhere.  Some recurring 
costs such as LES salaries ($37,000) should come from PD 
allotment.  PAO would request an increase in PD allotment 
from EAP/PD to meet this new cost. 
 
OPTION B: LEASING THE USG PROPERTY TO AN EDUCATIONAL NGO TO 
PERFORM OUTREACH PROGRAMS UNDER A GRANT AGREEMENT 
 
16. (SBU) The USG property (former Consulate Building) could 
be leased to an international NGO active in Education 
programs to run programs similar to Public Diplomacy 
programs, but not under the direction of the country PAO. 
Funds from the Burma earmark, with appropriate notification 
to Congress, could be used in a multiyear grant to pay for 
most startup and recurring costs associated with the project. 
 Security upgrades would not be required by law. 
 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POST AND GRANTEE 
17. (SBU) The grantee NGO would administer a program with 
aims similar to the country public diplomacy program, but 
would not be under the supervision of the country PAO.   In 
accordance with grants policy, the PAO could function as a 
program officer to the grant, ensuring that the program is 
being run in good faith, but could not provide day-to-day 
direction.  PAS Rangoon could cooperate on programs and could 
provide some materials and assistance to the grantee, as it 
does to other local organizations 
 
18. (SBU) As part of the grant agreement, the USG could lease 
the former consulate building to the NGO for a nominal fee of 
$1 per year.  The facility would not be a diplomatic 
installation, but may have a status equivalent to the British 
Council, which has quietly operated a small reading room in 
Mandalay for two years.  Post hopes that the grantee would 
enjoy protection from GOB harassment because of its 
affiliation with a diplomatic entity.  The NGO would have to 
register with the Government of Burma. 
 
19. (SBU) The grantee could recruit and provide 
teacher/trainers for the English language programs, and could 
locally recruit a reference librarian and other clerical 
support staff.  The grantee,s program could host speaker and 
cultural presentations from PAS Rangoon on a quarterly basis. 
 The grantee could network with other civil society 
organizations in Mandalay and help the PAO to identify 
exchange participants from Mandalay and northern Burma.  The 
grantee,s library staff could help disseminate PAS 
Rangoon,s publications and products. 
20. (SBU) The grantee could not be expected to perform the 
policy advocacy role of a State Department public diplomacy 
program. 
 
21. (C) In addition, without the diplomatic cover of the USG, 
it is unclear whether the grantee could effectively run the 
stealth governance program described in paragraph 4 above. 
 
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS 
22. (SBU) By leasing the property to the NGO, the USG is no 
longer obligated by regulation to bring the property up to 
security standards mandated for USG diplomatic installations. 
 However, because the site has strong association with the 
United States, and because American citizens may be among the 
grantee,s staff, the place may run some risks of being a 
target of terrorism, as do many American NGO\'s around the 
world.  The Department will have to decide whether it has a 
perceived obligation to provide the same security upgrades it 
would to an American Center. 
FUNDING CONSIDERATIONS 
23. (SBU) By AID,s estimation, in consultation with its 
Legal office, costs for furnishings, computers and 
telecommunications, generator, electrical upgrade and 
maintenance costs, program materials, books, annual staffing 
costs, janitorial, grounds keeping, utilities, and fuel could 
be covered by ESF.  Although most of the above will be 
provided by the grantee, it might be expedient for post 
(still using ESF) to provide procurement and importation of 
furniture, computers, and other aspects of the facilities 
upgrade. 
 
24. (SBU) AID advises that non-project costs, such as raising 
the perimeter fence and providing security guards, could not 
be allocated to ESF.  If these are deemed necessary, funds 
will need to be found. 
FINDING THE RIGHT GRANTEE 
25.  (SBU) In preliminary discussions, post has not found a 
grantee willing to take on such a novel arrangement.  The 
representative of one large Educational NGO with extensive 
worldwide experience, already in grant relationships with 
both AID and State, has told PAO they would be willing to 
provide English teachers to a USG operated facility in 
Mandalay (as per Option A or C).  But the representative said 
they would not be interested in taking on a challenge like 
Option B &on our own.8  The well-known difficulties of 
establishing a relationship with the GOB, together with the 
controversy inherent in teaching English with a democracy 
bent, apparently makes the risks outweigh the benefits for 
this organization.  While there may be more zealous or less 
experienced organizations willing to take up the challenge, 
post would need to weigh the judiciousness of entering into a 
close programming association with them. 
 
OPTION C OPENING AN AMERICAN CENTER ANNEX AS A TENANT IN 
COMMERCIAL SPACE 
 
26. (SBU) In May, GSO, PAO, and RSO, accompanied by regional 
Security Engineers, visited several commercial properties 
available for rent in Mandalay.  GSO and PAO identified two 
as best meeting requirements for the proposed program in 
acceptable downtown mixed retail/residential areas. 
Available commercial space affords no setback from road or 
neighbors, and is often adjacent to open sewers or other 
eyesores.  While rents are not high, there would be costs 
associated with security upgrades and other modifications. 
 
27. (SBU) Property One is a new, four-story, reinforced 
concrete structure, currently configured as living space, 
sharing one half of the ground floor with a fast food retail 
shop.  The ground floor hall has ample room to install a PAC. 
 With some modifications, the upper three floors could be 
configured to serve as classrooms, office space, library 
reading room, and event space.  Rent was quoted at 
$1,000/month for 5880 square feet. 
 
28. (SBU) Property Two is a three-story space in a row of 
similar shops in a new, reinforced concrete structure.  Most 
are not yet occupied but are designed for street-level 
retail, and mixed retail/residential above.  The first floor 
could accommodate a PAC and office space, and the upper two 
floors could accommodate a 1500 square foot library reading 
room and two English teaching classrooms. Rent was quoted at 
$2000/month for 4536 square feet.  There are many similar 
rental spaces available in this newly redeveloped quarter of 
Mandalay, which is a joint venture of the local government 
and some (Chinese) businessmen. 
 
29. (SBU) In the interests of thoroughness, GSO and PAO also 
investigated commercial space in Mandalay,s centrally 
located hotels, but found nothing appropriate.  The Sedona 
Hotel offered space configured as serviced apartments and 
space designed for their own administrative offices 
accessible only through a service stairway.  Access and space 
configurations were problematic in both.  The Mandalay Swan 
Hotel offered four adjoining shops spaces adjacent to the 
hotel with a very pleasant entrance off quiet 68 th street. 
The total space, under 1500 square feet, could accommodate 
the teaching classrooms but the associated 
library/information resource center program. 
 
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS 
30. (SBU) As with every commercial property examined, there 
is no setback from the street, or from neighboring buildings, 
which are as near as six inches away.  Because of the high 
price of land in central Mandalay, new structures are built 
on their entire allowable footprint (and possibly beyond it). 
 The facility would be governed by the physical security 
standards of 12 FAH-6, H-111.7 - Physical Security Tenant of 
Commercial Office Space.  Collocation and setback waivers 
would have to be sought. 
 
FUNDING CONSIDERATIONS 
31. (SBU) Startup and recurring costs and possible sources of 
funding would be similar to Option A, with the addition of 
annual rent of $12,000 to $24,000.  Also, security upgrades 
will be at least as expensive as for Option A, and possibly 
higher. 
THREE OPTIONS: PRO\'S AND CON\'S WEIGHED 
 
32. (SBU) Option A Pro,s and Con,s: 
Pro,s: 
 
--  The attractive USG-owned facility is in good to excellent 
repair, requiring little upgrading (other than security) and 
reconfiguration. 
 
--  On a large parcel of land, it has excellent setback and 
could be brought up to security standards with some outlay. 
 
--  USG-owned means no delay or harassment from local 
authorities, also no additional recurring costs from rent 
($12,000 ) $24,000/year). 
 
--  American Center Teaching Annex (vs. grant agreement with 
NGO) means mission has control over all program content. 
 
--  Prime location for reaching target groups 
 
Con,s: 
 
--  Post will have large initial outlays for start-up and 
security upgrade (but not necessarily larger than with other 
options). 
 
33. (SBU) Option B Pro,s and Con,s 
Pro\'s: 
 
--  No legal requirement for security upgrade. 
 
--  NGO programming would share most Country PD goals. 
 
--  More recurring costs, such as salaries, could be covered 
by ESF through the grant agreement. 
 
Con\'s: 
 
--  Mission would not have supervisory role or control over 
all program content. 
 
--  NGO could not play Policy Advocate role of PD. 
 
--  Without diplomatic or USG employee status, NGO, program, 
and participants may be subject to more harassment by GOB and 
local authorities. 
 
34. (SBU) Option C Pro,s and Con,s 
Pro,s: 
 
--  The commercial space identified, though in some ways 
inferior to the USG owned property in Mandalay, could be made 
as serviceable. 
 
--  Locations are as good as the USG owned property. 
 
Con,s: 
 
--  Being a \"tenant in commercial space\" is meant to lower 
the facility\'s desirability as a terrorism target because it 
would entail too much collateral damage to other tenants. 
But crowded urban locations afford more chances for 
terrorists to hide.  With no setback from neighbors or the 
street, these locations may be less secure than the USG owned 
property set apart on a large parcel of land. 
 
--  Post will have to spend the same amount of dollars, if 
not more, for necessary security upgrades on the rental 
properties as on USG-owned property. 
 
--  Post will have to secure a setback waiver and other 
waivers for the rental properties. 
 
--  With a rental property, post gives GOB and local 
authorities an entry point for harassment.  The authorities 
may use threats or pressure on the landlord to cause delays 
or interference with services to the PD program.  The 
landlord of the current American Center in Rangoon was jailed 
before the Center opened in 1991.  And Mandalay authorities 
used threats to hotel employees to disrupt a PD cultural 
program in January 2003 (Rangoon 00134).  Post may even spend 
funds on security upgrades only to find the landlord renege 
on the contract because of pressure from authorities. 
 
--  Implicit in this option is post\'s disposal of the USG 
property, i.e., sell it back to the despotic Burmese regime 
for what was paid for it (now worth $75), leading to a huge 
windfall for the Generals, and a public affairs embarrassment 
for the Department.

1.  (C) Trouble in Sittwe:  Local officials on July 22 
reportedly tore down a mosque in Sittwe, 70 miles SE of the 
Bangladeshi border, and arrested seven Muslims, one of whom 
subsequently died in custody.  This information came to us 
from Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and UN contacts.  Apparently the 
mosque\'s leadership made unauthorized improvements to the 
structure, resulting in the decision by local authorities to 
tear down the whole building.  Buddhist monks and Muslim 
shopkeepers also clashed on July 18 in Pyinmana, a small town 
between Mandalay and Rangoon, according to local media 
reports. 
 
2.  (SBU) Paramilitary training:  A trusted Burmese contact 
claims the USDA-affiliated \"Power Ranger\" militia is 
receiving rudimentary riot-control and military training in 
central Burma and elsewhere.  \"They are being told their 
mission is to hold up any attacking Americans long enough for 
Russia and China to come to the rescue,\" he explained. 
Chuckling, he added, \"The Russians--that\'s a good one.\" 
Media reports also claim the GOB is training a paramilitary 
\"Peoples Militia\" in Arakan State to assist in putting down 
any general uprising. 
 
3.  (C) Comment: Muslim-Buddhist troubles have periodically 
flared up in Sittwe and elsewhere.  We frequently hear 
stories of pro-SPDC \"fake monks\" allegedly inciting violence 
against Muslims to deflect anti-regime ire.  This does not 
seem to be the case in these latest incidents, and, with the 
political temperature in Burma quite high, any incident could 
quickly get out of hand.  A leader of the student rebellion 
of 1988 told us recently that he thinks there will be 
substantial bloodshed in Burma before year\'s end.  Perhaps 
the training of various paramilitary groups indicates the 
generals share this view.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURNING FOR BOOKS IN BURMA: HIGH SUCCESS 
WITH LOW TECH 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  American Center publications and 
library programs are currently enjoying new highs of 
popularity.  The military government of Burma 
censors the press, dictates radio and television 
broadcasts, limits access to the internet, and 
controls every educational institution across Burma, 
creating a hunger for unbiased and free information. 
Public Affairs Rangoon\'s strategy to promote 
American values relies on old-school information 
delivery techniques:  paper products in the form of 
books, magazines, and pamphlets.  Despite lean 
economic times and less disposable family income for 
most Burmese, the past months have seen a steady 
increase in new library memberships and in 
subscriptions to post publications.  While the trend 
predates the May 30 ambush of democracy leaders, PAS 
experienced a large uptick in attendance in June 
when populations were particularly hungry for 
uncensored information from abroad about events in 
their own country. End summary. 
 
LINING UP FOR LIBRARY CARDS 
------- 
2. During the month of June, Four hundred and fifty 
new members enrolled in the Library/IRC and 6,724 
patrons walked through its doors and checked out 
4,108 books, cassettes, and videotapes.  The 
Library\'s patrons are overwhelmingly young adults. 
Nearly 60 percent of those visiting in June were 
university students.  Another 25 percent were 
students of English and high school graduates 
waiting for places to open at Rangoon\'s 
universities.  The remaining patrons included 
medical doctors, government bureaucrats, teachers, 
lawyers, and other professionals. 
 
3. Public and university libraries are only poorly 
stocked and maintained.  Government restrictions 
limit content and little funding means most books 
are dated, if not worm-eaten.  Only the libraries 
run by the American Center and the British Council 
offer anything close to a modern, comprehensive 
library.  Even with the American Center\'s modest 
collection of 8,000 volumes and 70 periodicals, the 
demand for our services is strong and continues to 
rise.  At just 500 kyat (about 50 cents) a year, 
most any Burmese can afford to join the American 
Center Library.  New memberships have averaged 370 a 
month, and are climbing, since December 2002.  One 
recent Saturday in July, 173 new members joined. 
The Library now has nearly 11,000 active members. 
 
4. The demand for library services is not limited to 
Burmese living in Rangoon.  Just prior to the May 30 
crackdown on democracy activists, the American 
Center Library went on the road to participate for 
the first time in the book fairs of two universities 
outside of Rangoon, the Bago Degree College and Pyay 
University.  The universities were enthusiastic 
about collaboration with the American Center.  They 
assisted us in gaining permission from the Ministry 
of Education and the Ministry of Information to 
display our books on their campuses and even 
rescheduled their fairs for our benefit when the 
Ministry of Information delayed granting approval. 
(The Ministry granted its permission after 
physically inspecting all sixty books intended for 
our display.) 
 
5. At the book fairs, the American Center displayed 
about 60 titles covering environmental science, 
globalization, HIV/AIDS, and drug abuse.  Professors 
and students alike browsed our traveling collection, 
some stopping to read intently.  Many teachers wrote 
down the titles and authors and requested IRC 
assistance in acquiring these books for use in their 
courses.  Good dictionaries and titles on the 
environment were in particular demand on both 
campuses. 
 
6. We took the rare opportunity of being on campus 
to distribute free copies of post produced 
publications.  At Pyay, pandemonium ensued when word 
spread that the American Center was giving books 
away, and the line to receive them soon snaked out 
the door of the exhibit hall.  In total, more than 
1,800 copies of American Center produced magazines 
were distributed along with nearly 1,000 books from 
the American Center book translation program. 
Titles distributed included \"Democracy in America\" 
by De Tocqueville, \"My American Journey\" by Colin 
Powell, and other biographies and works of fiction. 
 
7. Bago Degree College has about 1500 full time 
students while another 10,000 attend as distance- 
learners.  All are undergraduate students.  Pyay 
University boasts a student population of roughly 
5,000 (of which three quarters are undergraduate 
students) with another 20,000 enrolled in their 
distance learning courses.  The DPAO and the 
American Center Library team, accompanied by the 
Bangkok Regional Librarian Officer, feel confident 
they greeted a high percentage of both student 
bodies.  Both Bago Degree College and Pyay 
University invited American Center participation in 
their 2004 book fairs. 
 
B.  NEW LOOK, NEW APPEAL FOR PERIODICALS 
------ 
8. Following a makeover and a subscription drive 
that closed recently, paid subscriptions to post- 
produced publications in English and Burmese (see 
para 10) rose more than 27 percent over last year. 
(A total of 24,200 subscriptions in 2003, over 
19,013 subscriptions for 2002.)  Our press and 
publications staff injected a more vital feel to our 
venerable publications, with more articles meant to 
appeal to youth and the use of vibrant colors and 
tag lines to make features stand out.  In addition 
to increased subscriptions, positive reader feedback 
has also surged. 
 
9. The American Center\'s printing press publishes 
over 700,000 pages of material every month. 
Contractors translate some materials, exchange 
participants and other Center contacts write 
original articles, and American Center staff edits 
the whole.  Then in-house staff, led by a 
professional graphic artist, designs each 
publication, does the camera work, plate-making, and 
four color printing.  By running a printing press 
inhouse, PAS eliminates one avenue of pressure the 
Burmese government could use to delay our 
publications. 
 
10. Description of periodical publications: 
 
a. American News & Views (circulation:  fewer than 
100) is the Post\'s daily newsletter, based entirely 
on Washington File\'s EPF section.  It is edited in- 
house for substance and clarity.  ANV is aimed at 
laying the groundwork for future media placement. 
By limiting distribution to fewer than 100, the 
American Center may circumvent the Press Scrutiny 
Board (government censor board) review of content. 
 
b. News & Features USA (circulation:  6,975) is a 
biweekly containing backgrounders from the 
Washington File, Electronic Journals, etc. 
 
c. American Mosaic (circulation:  8,757) is a 
monthly publication containing articles from the VOA 
Special English program.  Written in simple English, 
the publication is targeted to young Burmese 
students of English. 
 
d. Lin Yaung Chi USA (circulation:  8,468) is a 
bimonthly Burmese-language publication providing 
information and knowledge about various aspects of 
the United States. Targeted readers are the general 
Burmese public. 
 
e. Enduring Freedom (circulation: 10,000) a monthly 
Burmese-language publication published in support of 
the global war on terrorism.  It is distributed free 
at the IRC, as an insert in other publications and 
by embassy personnel.  Entire issues have been 
reprinted in the progressive bimonthly journal, 
Light of Islam (circulation 6,000).  In the months 
following September 11, 2001, the newsletter was 
published monthly.  Leading up to and during the 
recent conflict in Iraq, EF was published weekly. 
One entire issue of Enduring Freedom detailed Saddam 
Hussein\'s crimes against the Iraqi people. 
 
11. PAS Rangoon also runs an active book translation 
program.  In FY 2002, two books were translated into 
Burmese:  Katherine Graham\'s \"Personal History\" and 
Secretary Powell\'s \"My American Journey.\"  The 
 
SIPDIS 
Secretary\'s autobiography passed the censor board in 
 
SIPDIS 
record time and was a swift seller, popular with 
both democratic opposition and military government 
types. (The embassy hopes it conveyed positive 
images of healthy military-civilian relations and 
roles, but has yet to see any manifestation of such 
influence in the Burmese military rulers.)  Thomas 
Friedman\'s \"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\" will head 
to press in September and Paul Krugman\'s \"The 
Accidental Theorist\" in December. Henry Hazlitt\'s 
\"Economics in One Lesson\" is already in process for 
2004 publication. 
 
C. SATISFYING THE HUNGER BEYOND RANGOON 
------ 
12. Comment:  There is a hunger for information 
across Burma.  Because the media is not free and the 
education system is failing, many people look to the 
American Center to help fill in gaps created by the 
regime.  The crowds visiting the American Center in 
Rangoon daily testify to that.  And whenever 
American Center staff are able to travel, we see 
firsthand the hunger for information and contact in 
places like Pyay or Bago or Mandalay.  Although a 
particularly conservative military commander governs 
the second largest city, Mandalay, the people of 
that city come to our programs in larger than 
expected numbers. 
 
13.  In their own effort to extend beyond the 
capital, the British Council made a one-time 
endowment with year 2000 funds to create ten 
Millennium Centers (similar to our American Corners 
concept but focused exclusively on English language 
education) housed at community civil society 
organizations -- often the local YMCA or a church- 
based learning center -- in secondary cities across 
the country.  The British Council also opened a 
satellite office/reading room in Mandalay.  The 
American Center actively supports the Millenium 
Centers with English teaching materials donations 
and by conducting English teacher training courses 
for their personnel. 
 
14. In a country where the communication 
infrastructure is archaic and the government 
controls the media, the American Center relies on 
tried and true public diplomacy tools.  In other 
countries, what Edward R. Murrow called \"the last 
three feet\" might be closed by a modem or by a 
televised interview.  But not in Burma.  In Burma, 
\"old-school\" brick and mortar and \"low-tech\" paper 
and ink consistently reach our hungry young audience 
with a high degree of success.  Only with more of 
each will we reach farther.  End Comment.  MCMULLEN

2. Summary:  New U.S. investment in Burma has been illegal 
since 1997.  New sanctions imposed in 2003 ban imports of 
Burmese products into the United States and forbid all 
financial transactions between a U.S. person and Burma. 
Burma is a country blessed with extensive natural resources, 
low labor costs, and a great potential for tourism.  It is 
also a member of ASEAN.  However, even if U.S. sanctions were 
removed, an extraordinarily hostile investment climate would 
hold U.S. investment as it has held all other investment to a 
very low level. 
 
Though local investment laws are liberal on the surface, 
their implementation is racked, at all levels, with 
corruption.  The ruling military junta, the State Peace and 
Development Council (SPDC), despite pledging itself to an 
\"open door\" economic policy and urging foreign firms to 
invest, regularly comes out with punitive and capricious 
regulations, which make investment for foreigners difficult 
if not impossible. 
 
Our view of the current investment climate is very dim.  We 
have not seen any movement toward reform in recent years and 
expect none in the next year.  In fact, if recent events are 
any indication, the situation for investors could well become 
worse before it improves. End summary. 
 
3. Preface:  U.S. Investment Subject to Sanctions 
 
On May 20, 1997, by Executive Order 13047, the President 
imposed economic sanctions prohibiting new investment by U.S. 
persons or entities in Burma (Myanmar).  Those sanctions were 
based on the President\'s determination that the Government of 
Burma (GOB) has committed large-scale repression of the 
democratic opposition.  The Cohen-Feinstein Amendment to the 
Foreign Operations Act of 1997 formed the legal basis for the 
investment ban.  The U.S. government every six months reviews 
sanctions policy.  Since sanctions were imposed in 1997, the 
State Department has found no measurable progress toward 
political liberalization in Burma. 
 
Prior to the imposition of sanctions, a number of 
high-profile U.S. investors had already withdrawn from Burma. 
 An active anti-Burma consumer movement in the U.S. caused 
investing in Burma to be high risk in terms of corporate 
image.  The federal investment sanctions ban new investment 
but allow companies already invested in Burma to remain. 
 
The 1997 ban on new investment is in addition to a number of 
sanctions the U.S. imposed against Burma following the 
military crackdown against civilian democracy activists in 
1988 and the failed election of 1990.  The U.S. opposes the 
extension of international financial assistance to Burma, 
prohibits military sales, suspended economic aid and 
commercial assistance programs, banned the issuance of U.S. 
visas to members of the military, political, and economic 
elite, and downgraded our representation in Rangoon from 
Ambassador to Charge.  In addition, the U.S. continues to 
engage in a vigorous diplomatic effort to promote political 
and human rights reforms. 
 
Since the early 1990\'s U.S. commercial policy toward Burma 
had been neither to encourage nor to discourage trade or 
investment.  With the 1997 investment ban, that policy was 
revised to prohibit new investment. 
 
4. Openness to Foreign Investment 
 
With a view to attracting foreign investment, the Burmese 
government instituted the Foreign Investment Law (FIL) on 
November 30, 1988.  The basic priorities of foreign 
investment, according to the FIL, are as follows: 
 
(a) Promotion and expansion of exports; 
(b) Exploitation of natural resources that require heavy 
investment; 
(c) Acquisition of high technology; 
(d) Support for production and services requiring large 
amount of capital; 
(e) Expansion of Employment opportunities; 
(f) Development of facilities that would reduce energy 
consumption; and, 
(g) Regional development. 
 
According to the State-owned Economic Enterprises Law, 
enacted in March 1989, the Government state-owned enterprises 
have the sole right to carry out the following economic 
activities: 
 
(a) Extraction of teak and sale of the same in the country 
and abroad; 
(b) Cultivation and conservation of forest plantations with 
the exception of village-owned firewood plantations 
cultivated by the villagers for their personal use; 
(c) Exploration, extraction, sale, and production of 
petroleum and natural gas; 
(d) Exploration, extraction, and export of pearls, jade and 
precious stones; 
(e) Breeding and production of fish and prawns in fisheries 
which have been reserved for research by the Government; 
(f) Postal and telecommunications services; 
(g) Air transport and railway transport services; 
(h) Banking and insurance services; 
(i) Broadcasting and television services; 
(j) Exploration, extraction, and exports of metals; 
(k) Electricity generating services other than those 
permitted by law to private and cooperative electricity 
generating services; and, 
(l) Manufacturing of products relating to security and 
defense. 
 
However, the law provides that the Myanmar Investment 
Commission (MIC) may, \"in the interest of the State,\" make 
exceptions.  Exceptions have been made in areas such as banks 
(though not for foreign investors), petroleum and natural gas 
extraction, and air services.  This discretion, though, like 
most else resides in the hands of the cabinet and senior 
generals. 
 
According to the FIL, the MIC must review all investment, 
either foreign or domestic.  However, due to corruption 
within the MIC, the ruling State Peace and Development 
Council (SPDC) removed much of the MIC,s real influence at 
the end of 1999.  Potential investors must still work through 
the MIC, but it has lost the authority to make a decision. 
Interested foreign companies still approach and submit 
proposals through the MIC, which in turn gets approval from 
either the Cabinet (chaired by SPDC Chairman and Prime 
Minister Senior General Than Shwe) or the Trade Policy 
Council (TPC, chaired by SPDC Vice Senior General Maung Aye). 
 The Cabinet and the TPC have the same membership so the 
choice of decision-making body is made on a case-by-case 
basis.  Though MIC has no power or authority to protect 
foreign companies, we have no evidence of overt 
discrimination against foreign investors. 
Once the government grants permission to invest, a foreign 
company must get a \"Permit to Trade\" (essentially a business 
license) from the Ministry of National Planning and Economic 
Development\'s Directorate of Investment and Companies 
Administration (DICA).  In a typical \"Catch 22\" that has for 
all intents and purposes closed Burma to most new foreign 
investment, since February 2002 the government is no longer 
permitting DICA to issue new permits or renew existing ones 
for foreign firms.  This decision has disrupted the business 
of many foreign investors, and forced closure of several 
foreign manufacturing firms. 
 
In theory once a company has the \"Permit to Trade\" it may 
then use it to get residence visa status, lease cars and real 
estate, etc., and to get import and export licenses from the 
Ministry of Commerce.  The Ministry of Commerce has had a 
policy in place since the end of 2001, though there is 
nothing in writing, to only issue import licenses to those 
firms who are export earners. 
 
The existing foreign investment law and its procedures are 
positive for investors on paper.  However, in practice, it is 
very difficult to make the system work properly due to poor 
transparency and corruption all along the line.  The senior 
generals making the decisions do not seriously consider the 
law when they want to take action for or against investors. 
 
The FIL allows for FDI as a wholly foreign-owned venture or a 
joint venture with any Burmese partner (individual, private 
company, or state-owned company).  Sole proprietorships or 
partnerships are equally acceptable.  Overall, the FIL 
requires that at least 35 percent of equity capital in all 
JVs and partnerships be foreign-owned.  Officially, the 
minimum foreign investment is $500,000 for manufacturing 
investments and $300,000 for services. 
 
The military, via the military economic enterprises, the 
Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd. (UMEHL) and the 
Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), is involved in many 
economic activities.  To set up a joint venture, foreign 
firms have reported that it is useful to be affiliated with 
MEHL or MEC in order to receive the proper business permits. 
Nonetheless, entering into business with MEHL or MEC does not 
guarantee success for the foreign partner, and some foreign 
investors report that their military partners are parasitic, 
making unreasonable demands, providing no cost-sharing, and 
sometimes muscling out the foreign investor after an 
investment is up and running. 
 
5. Conversion and Transfer Policies 
 
According to the Foreign Investment Law, investors in Burma 
have a guarantee that they can repatriate profits (after 
taxes).  The law also provides that, upon expiry of the term 
of the contract, the investor of foreign capital has the 
right to the foreign currency in which the investment was 
made.  However, due to the shortage of foreign exchange it is 
in reality not easy for foreign investors to legally transfer 
their net profits abroad.  Foreign currency can be 
transferred abroad only after obtaining permission from the 
Foreign Exchange Management Department of the Central Bank of 
Myanmar. 
 
Likewise, multiple exchange rates in Burma make conversion 
and repatriation of foreign exchange very complex and ripe 
for corruption.  The official rate of 6 kyat to the dollar is 
grossly overvalued.  The government issues Foreign Exchange 
Certificates (FEC) that trade somewhat closer to the market 
rate but are still overvalued.  Generally speaking, foreign 
companies get rid of kyat earnings as quickly as possible -- 
usually by purchasing FEC or dollars at some variant of the 
market rate.  The government has allowed foreign companies to 
use dollars or FEC to pay utility and telephone bills, and 
rental charges.  It has also allowed foreign firms to deposit 
dollars in a state bank for withdrawal as FEC by the 
company\'s employees. 
In Burma, only three state banks, the Myanma Economic Bank 
(MEB), the Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), and 
the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) are allowed to deal with 
foreign exchange transactions.  In practice the MFTB and MICB 
handle most of these transactions.  The MFTB mainly handles 
foreign currency transactions of government organizations, 
businesses, and individuals, and the MICB caters primarily to 
companies and joint ventures.  MEB handles foreign currency 
transactions in border trade regions. 
 
Because most of Burma,s international trade is done in U.S. 
dollars, the restrictions on provisions of financial services 
by U.S. banks will cause serious disruption to the legal 
foreign trading system.  U.S. banks will no longer be able to 
offer trade facilitation or correspondent banking services, 
making the use of U.S. dollar letters of credit problematic. 
 
As of July 29, 2003, the correspondent accounts of MEB, MFTB, 
and MICB in the United States are frozen, along with all 
other assets and property. 
 
Private banks, despite assuming a large share of banking 
activity in the last several years, are not permitted to deal 
in foreign exchange.  In February 2003 there was a major run 
on private banks, and as of now their future is uncertain. 
However, there is no indication that if the private banking 
system is revitalized it will be given the right to deal in 
foreign currency. 
 
6. Expropriation and Compensation 
 
The Burmese Foreign Investment Law provides guarantees 
against nationalization during the investment\'s \"permitted 
period\" of investment.  However, a number of foreign firms in 
various sectors have been forced to leave the country when 
the terms and conditions of their investment agreements have 
not been honored.  In recent years two large Japanese firms 
exited Burma after they found they were not able to operate 
as they had been led to believe.  Additionally, there have 
been cases where the government has seized the assets of 
foreign and local investors (without compensation), when the 
investment turned out to be very profitable. 
 
The most recent example we know of is the case of a Swiss 
cement importer and distributor that was forced out 
ostensibly because it was not operating according to its 
permit.  In reality, the government turned the company out, 
after significant investment in plant and equipment, because 
the investor was able to sell better quality, cheaper cement 
than its government-controlled competitors.   In another case 
in 1999-2000, the military-owned MEC confiscated a large 
brewery that an expatriate Burmese businesswoman had made 
profitable.  The local courts were not helpful and to date 
the investor has been unable to get compensation from the GOB. 
 
7. Dispute Settlement 
 
Private and foreign companies are at a disadvantage in 
disputes with government organizations.  Arbitration is 
addressed under the 1944 Arbitration Act.  Foreign investors 
generally prefer to use international arbitration, though the 
Burmese government will try to stipulate local arbitration in 
contracts it signs with foreign investors.   If handled 
locally, difficulties arise since the central leadership 
controls the whole legal mechanism.  The courts are not 
independent and cannot make free and fair decisions.  There 
is no recourse available for companies who face an adverse 
administrative decision.  Burma is not a member of the 
International Center for the Settlement of Investment 
Disputes nor is it a party to the New York Convention. 
 
The legal system in Burma is ostensibly under the control of 
the Attorney General\'s Office and the Supreme Court. 
However, neither the Attorney General nor the Supreme Court 
is independent.  Burmese criminal and civil laws are modeled 
on British law as practiced during the colonial period -- 
which ended in 1948.  Every township, state, and division has 
its own law officers and judges.  However, the township, 
state and divisional SPDC branches have supreme authority 
over judicial decisions at the local level. 
 
There is no bankruptcy law in Burma. 
 
Foreign companies have the right to bring cases, and defend 
themselves, in local courts.  However, as the SPDC ruling 
junta controls all the courts, foreign investors who have had 
conflicts with the local government, or even had their 
business illegally expropriated, have had little luck getting 
compensation. 
 
8. Performance Requirements and Incentives 
 
Officially, companies covered under the Foreign Investment 
Law are entitled to a tax holiday period of three consecutive 
years.  Under the law this tax holiday can be extended with 
permission of the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC). 
Investors are also eligible, at the MIC,s discretion, for a 
number of other incentives including: accelerated 
depreciation of capital assets, a waiver of customs duties 
and taxes on imported machinery and spare parts during the 
period of construction, or on imported raw materials during 
the first three years of commercial production, etc.  Again, 
the TPC and the Cabinet, not the MIC, make decisions on these 
incentives and extensions. 
 
There are no official performance requirements for new 
foreign investors in Burma, but the government does require 
an investor purchase local machinery, fire, marine, and 
personal liability insurance.  Unofficially, the government 
often requires companies to commit to a certain level of 
exports before being allowed to invest.  The government then 
requires compliance reports every three months with evidence 
of export or explanation why the goals were not met.  We have 
no evidence that action is taken against firms that do not 
meet their initial export targets. 
 
There is no requirement that foreign investors buy or hire 
from local sources.  Technology transfer is not generally a 
pre-requisite for investment. 
 
According to Burmese law, any enterprise operating under the 
Foreign Investment Law or the Myanmar Companies Act must pay 
a 30 percent income tax rate.  Withholding tax on royalties 
and interest is 15 percent for resident foreigners and 20 
percent for non-resident foreigners.  Tax collection in Burma 
is very lax, but foreign investors are an easy target for the 
cash-strapped tax authorities.  The Burmese fiscal year ends 
March 31 and tax returns are due by June 30. 
 
A surprising reversal of the government\'s mantra of \"open 
door economy\" came in a February 2002 verbal directive which 
outlawed the issuance of new, or renewal of existing, 
\"Permits to Trade\" for trading firms owned by foreigners (or 
by foreigners and Burmese).  This was done ostensibly to 
promote local trading firms, but has served only to further 
distort the local marketplace.  The authorities have not 
published any official notice of this directive but it is 
being enforced, including against foreigners who have tried 
to evade the directive by listing their company under the 
name of a Burmese colleague or friend. 
 
9. Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
 
By law, foreigners may not own land, and may only rent 
property on a short-term basis. 
 
A private entity can establish, buy, sell, and own a business 
only with the review and approval of the MIC (and by proxy 
the top leadership). 
 
10. Protection of Property Rights 
 
Burma does not yet have adequate IPR protection.  Patent, 
trademark, and copyright laws and regulations are all 
deficient.  Thus Burma is unlikely to meet WTO TRIPS 
obligations in the near to medium term.  After Burma joined 
ASEAN in 1997, it agreed to modernize its intellectual 
property laws in accordance with the ASEAN Framework 
Agreement on Intellectual Property Cooperation.  However, an 
IPR law, first drafted in 1994, still awaits approval and 
implementation.  A Patents and Design Act was introduced in 
1946, but never brought into force.  Thus the Indian Patents 
and Designs Act of 1911, which was enacted under British 
colonial rule, continues to govern the registration of 
patents and designs. 
 
Piracy of music CDs, video CDs, CD-ROMS, DVDs, books, 
software, and designs is evident nationwide, especially in 
the two major urban centers of Mandalay and Rangoon. 
However, given the small number of customers (most Burmese 
are too poor), and the lack of adequate infrastructure (e.g., 
reliable electricity), we do not believe piracy has a 
significant adverse impact on U.S. products, which, are in 
any case, not readily available.  There is little evidence of 
widespread use of pirated software and hardware by government 
agencies, though the nascent computer and IT sector often 
relies on pirated software for training courses and other 
uses. 
 
Burma has no trademark law, though trademark registration is 
possible.  Some firms place a trademark caution notice in the 
local newspaper, declaring ownership of their trademarks. 
Once this notice has been published, criminal and/or civil 
action can be taken against trademark infringers.  Title to a 
trademark depends on use of the trademark in connection with 
goods sold in Burma.  While a Copyright Act was promulgated 
in 1914, no means to register a copyright was ever 
instituted.  There is thus no legal protection in Burma for 
foreign copyrights. 
 
In the vast majority of cases, real estate is purchased with 
cash or using regular bank loans.  However, there are a few 
banks that offer rudimentary mortgage facilities.  Foreigners 
may not generally avail themselves of this, though, because 
they may not own land. 
 
11. Transparency of the Regulatory System 
 
Burma is notorious among foreign businesspeople for its 
complete lack of regulatory and legal transparency.  All 
existing regulations, including those covering foreign 
investment, import-export procedures, licensing, foreign 
exchange, etc., are subject to change, with no advance 
notice, at the whim of the senior ruling generals.  The 
economic decision-makers here are influenced strongly by 
wealthy cronies, the demands of state-owned enterprises, and 
of the military-controlled Myanmar Economic Corporation and 
the Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd.  The government also 
regularly issues new regulations with no notice and with no 
opportunity for review or comment by any non-governmental 
domestic or any foreign market participants.  Furthermore, 
new regulations or regulatory changes are rarely published. 
Instead, they are communicated verbally to interested 
parties.  If a new regulation or law is published it will 
appear in the government\'s mouthpiece newspaper, the New 
Light of Myanmar (Myanma A\'Lin or in the Burma Gazette. 
 
Burma\'s health, environmental, tax, and labor laws as written 
do not impose a major burden on investment.  However, the 
protean nature of the regulatory and legal situation -- and 
the irregular enforcement of existing laws -- makes 
investment tricky without good, and well-connected, local 
legal advice. 
 
12. Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
 
Burma has no true equity or debt markets, and the notion of 
portfolio investment is not well understood by the average 
person.   Burmese authorities have said in the past that the 
existence of capital markets is essential for the development 
of a well-functioning financial system.  To this end, the 
Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB) and Japan\'s Daiwa Institute of 
Research Co. Ltd. established a joint venture, the Myanma 
Security Exchange Centre Ltd., to set up a stock exchange. 
This exchange is in existence, though moribund, with only one 
listed company -- a forestry joint venture.  A few companies 
have also begun to sell bonds privately and on a very small 
scale.  Private companies, both foreign and domestically 
controlled, are generally small and thus their shares are 
closely held by a small number of people or entities -- often 
within a family.  There is a securities law being drafted 
now, but no interested private parties have been allowed to 
see, or comment on, the draft. 
 
A large bank run in February 2003, and the subsequent 
decision by the government to avoid bailouts, has effectively 
cut off the private banking system from the market. The 
state-owned and semi state-owned banks were not impacted by 
this crisis.  Government instructions and internal bank 
policies have made it impossible for private banks to take in 
new deposits or loans, and weekly withdrawals are capped. 
Currently the private banks are in limbo, the government 
indecisive for now on whether to liquidate, actively 
restructure, or rescue the troubled institutions. 
 
Foreign firms do not have access to bank loans since the 
banks require collateral of land or real estate, neither of 
which foreigners can own.  Since mid-2002 the use of gold as 
collateral has been forbidden.  Loans in kyat are available 
for local companies and individuals from state and, until 
February 2003, private banks.  Interest rates are currently 
running about 15 percent per year with inflation about 3 
times that.  Because of these negative real interest rates, a 
lack of adequate supervision, and a shortage of banking 
experience the private banking system, even at its peak, was 
very unstable.  Private banks engaged in reckless lending and 
suffered high levels of non-performing loans.  Though 
statistics are not available, it is believed that public 
banks, forced to bankroll the regime\'s pet projects and 
personal needs, also have extremely large numbers of 
non-performing loans. 
 
A 1990 banking law permitted foreign banks to open branches 
in Burma but not to conduct business in the local market. 
These offices may serve as a trade and commercial liaison for 
local and foreign clients.   For a variety of reasons, 
including the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, the 
slow local business climate, and the lack of liberalization 
of the banking sector, most of the original 49 foreign banks 
have left Burma, or downgraded their representation, in the 
past five years.   U.S. persons may not provide financial 
services to Burma. 
 
Burma has no standard accounting system.  International 
accounting firms in country, though they may offer only 
\"consulting services,\" adhere to the General Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP).  We have heard that the Burmese 
government is trying to establish a separate Myanmar 
Accounting Principles (MAP) system, but this is still on the 
drawing board. 
 
13.  Political Violence 
 
In May 2003, government-affiliated thugs ambushed a convoy 
carrying opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi while she was 
traveling in northwest Burma.  Dozens were killed or wounded 
during the attack.  Two bombs went off in downtown Rangoon in 
early 2003.  A small incendiary device exploded at a downtown 
pagoda in 1996, and Burmese authorities reportedly found 
other bomb devices in 1999 and 2000.  The military government 
tightened security around the international airport in 
Rangoon after two RPG devices were discovered near the 
airport in early 2002. 
 
Burma experienced major political unrest in 1988 when the 
military regime jailed and/or killed an undetermined number 
of Burmese democracy activists.  In 1990, the military 
government refused to recognize the results of an election 
that the opposition won overwhelmingly.  Burma experienced 
major student demonstrations in 1996, and demonstrations 
occurred in August and September of 1998.  Popular unrest and 
violence continue to be possible. 
 
For the last decade there has been sporadic anti-government 
insurgent activity in various locations, such as an attack on 
a natural gas pipeline in the Tanintharyi Division and bomb 
attacks against family members of senior military officials 
in Rangoon.  Chin and Arakan States and the Thai-Burma border 
area in Burma\'s southern Shan, Mon, Karenni, and Karen States 
have been the scenes of occasional fighting between 
government forces and various insurgent groups.  In February 
2001, several people were killed and some tourists left 
stranded during shelling and cross-border gunfire in the town 
of Tachileik, Shan State.  The Thai-Burma border is closed 
from time to time due to increased insurgent activity, most 
recently in 2002. 
 
14.  Corruption 
 
Corruption is systemic in Burma and is considered by 
economists and businesspeople to be one of the most serious 
barriers to investment and doing business in Burma.  Because 
of the Byzantine and capricious regulatory environment, 
rent-seeking activities are rampant and very little can be 
accomplished, from the micro to the macro, without paying 
\"tea money.\"  We think this problem will only get worse at 
all levels as inflation and the erosion of the kyat further 
impoverish government bureaucrats and as senior leaders seek 
additional income from a shrinking number of investment 
projects. 
 
Corruption is a jailable offense in Burma, and has been since 
1948.  However, the anti-corruption statute is applied only 
when the senior generals want to take action against some 
official who has become an embarrassment.  In all other cases 
corruption is considered a very normal practice -- indeed a 
requirement for survival.   The major, though by no means 
only, areas where investors run into corruption are: when 
seeking investment permission, taxation, when applying for 
import and export licenses, and, when negotiating land and 
real estate leases. 
 
15.  Bilateral Investment Agreements 
 
Burma has signed bilateral investment agreements, known as 
\"Protection and Promotion of Investment\" agreements with the 
Philippines, the PRC, and Vietnam.  Except for increasing 
investment from the PRC, these agreements have had little 
impact on incoming investment from Vietnam or the Philippines. 
 
16.  OPIC and Other Insurance Programs 
 
Due to U.S. law OPIC does not operate in Burma.  Burma is not 
a member of the World Bank\'s Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA). 
 
17.  Labor 
 
In 1989, the United States withdrew Burma\'s eligibility for 
benefits under the generalized system of preferences (GSP) 
due to the absence of internationally recognized worker 
rights.  Labor unions are illegal in Burma.  Workers are 
unable to organize, negotiate, or in any other way exercise 
control over their working conditions.  Although regulations 
set a minimum employment age and wage, and maximum work 
hours, these are not uniformly observed, especially in 
private factories and other establishments.  The government 
uses forced adult labor in infrastructure construction and 
porterage for the military in active combat zones.  These 
labor practices are not consistent with Burma\'s obligations 
under ILO Conventions 29 and 87, and thus explain why the ILO 
imposed sanctions against Burma in 2000.  The United States 
strongly supported this decision. 
 
Burma,s cost of labor is very low, even compared to some of 
its Southeast Asian neighbors.  Burmese over the age of 40, 
and particularly those over 65, tend to be very well 
educated.  However, a sad side effect of the repeated closing 
of Burmese universities over the past 15 years is that the 
current 15-30 year old demographic is sorely lacking in 
technical skills.  Many Burmese, though, speak at least some 
level of English.  Many educated Burmese studied English in 
mission schools during the British colonial and early 
independence period.  After the nationalization of private 
and mission schools in 1964, the socialist government 
mandated English courses in school starting from the middle 
school.  However, soon thereafter then-dictator General Ne 
Win ordered that English instruction begin in kindergarten 
after his daughter failed an English exam and was rejected 
for studies in the U.K. 
 
The government does not publish unemployment figures. 
However, anecdotal evidence and the recent divestment by many 
foreign companies, support the assumption of a very high 
level of unemployed and underemployed in non-agricultural 
sectors.  An average factory worker in Burma will make about 
500-800 kyat per day. 
 
18.  Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
 
The government has set aside as \"industrial zones\" large 
tracts of land surrounding Rangoon and Mandalay.  However, 
these zones are merely zoned for industry and do not come 
with any investment incentives. 
 
There are no free trade zones in Burma. 
 
19.  Foreign Direct Investment Statistics 
 
Note:  Investment figures published by the GOB include only 
investment approved by the Myanmar Investment Commission 
(MIC).  These figures do not include investments not 
submitted for MIC approval, such as a myriad of small and 
medium Chinese projects. 
 
According to government figures at the end of March 2003, 
cumulative foreign investment approved by the MIC totaled 371 
projects, valued at US$7.5 billion.  This amount is 1.2 
percent higher than the cumulative total listed at the end of 
March 2002.   However, it should be noted that this 
cumulative number does not factor in subsequent divestment, 
or investment that was approved but that did not actually 
enter the country. 
 
Extrapolating from the latest government statistics on FDI 
flow for the Burmese FY 2002-03 (April-March), we estimate a 
357 percent year-on-year increase in new FDI approvals 
($86.95 million) in 4 sectors compared with total new 
investment approvals in FY 2001-02 ($19.002 million).  The 
new investments came from Malaysia ($44 million in oil and 
gas and $18.25 million in fishery), Hong Kong ($12.88 million 
in manufacturing), Singapore ($6.1 million in fishery), 
Switzerland ($3.38 million in mining), Brunei ($2.04 million 
in fishery) and Korea ($0.3 million in manufacturing). 
 
Despite the hangover from the Asian financial crisis, the 
trickle of approved new investment since 1997 has come almost 
exclusively from Asian countries.  Malaysia, Singapore, 
Switzerland, and Korea registered new investment in Burma in 
FY 2002-03.  Western countries have largely stayed away from 
the Burma market.  U.S. investment has been zero since 1997 
when the U.S. government imposed an investment ban. 
 
In stock terms, the United States is the fifth largest 
foreign investor in Burma with 16 projects totaling US$582 
million.  U.S. investment approved prior to May 1997, which 
was grandfathered under the U.S. investment sanctions order, 
is largely centered in oil and natural gas exploration.  The 
small number of other U.S. firms in Burma is involved 
primarily in tourism, management, consulting, and trading. 
While Malaysia is ranked 4th in FDI stock, it was 1st in new 
FDI agreements in 2002-03 (according to Burmese government 
statistics).  These official statistics do not take into 
consideration considerable new investment, some of it 
state-financed, from the PRC. 
 
Major non-U.S. foreign investors in Burma are: Petronas 
(Malaysia), Total (France), Ivanhoe Mines (Canada), PTT, Plc. 
(Thailand), Shin Satellite (Thailand), Keppel Land 
(Singapore), China National Construction and Agricultural 
Machinery Import and Export Co. (PRC), and the China 
International Trust and Investment Corporation (PRC). 
 
So far there is no concrete evidence of large-scale 
investment abroad by Burmese companies.  However, we believe 
that some wealthy Burmese individuals and small family 
businesses have made a few investments in neighboring ASEAN 
countries.

HOMES OF OTHER NLD LEADERS 
 
 
Classified By: CDA, a.i. Ron McMullen for reason 1.5 (d) 
 
1.  (S) NLD insiders tell us Aung San Suu Kyi has recently 
been held in the house of a military officer on the complex 
of a counter-terrorism unit in Hlegu Township, a few miles 
north of Rangoon\'s international airport.  We do not know if 
she is there permanently or was moved temporarily (from the 
Clear Water Pond facility or elsewhere) to facilitate the 
ICRC visit.  We hope to get a readout from the ICRC head of 
delegation August 4th on his recent meeting with ASSK.  A 
visiting academic with good links to the SPDC has asked to 
see her, but so far has received no reply. 
 
2.  (C) On July 30 emboffs drove to the Rangoon homes of 
eight senior NLD leaders who are being held under house 
arrest.  In most instances the homes were guarded by one 
policeman and a municipal ward representative (typically an 
unemployed young man paid \"tea money\" by MI to restrict 
access to the house).  In some cases the police permitted us 
to deliver packets of \"American News and Views\" right to the 
houses, but more often they took the packets with a promise 
to deliver them once the contents were cleared by their 
superiors.  We know that as of August 1 NLD Chairman U Aung 
Shwe has not received the packet we delivered. 
 
3.  (C) We understand that this rather lax house arrest 
system has enabled NLD activists to occasionally sneak into 
the homes of the party leadership to pass news and receive 
instructions.  We will continue our rather high-profile 
regular visits, whether or not we are successful in getting 
printed material to the detainees, to remind the SPDC and the 
detained NLD leaders that we remain concerned about their 
plight.

SUBJECT: NATIVES RESTLESS OVER SCOPE OF NEW SANCTIONS 
 
 
1. This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 5. 
 
2. The Charge d\'Affaires, a.i. and Econoff held briefings on 
the new U.S. sanctions on July 30th for U.S. citizens, and 
July 31st for Burmese and third-country businesspeople, NGOs, 
and the diplomatic and UN community.  Both briefings were 
well-received.  We asked the attendees not to debate U.S. 
policy, but to stay focused on technical issues.  Generally 
the two audiences complied, but were genuinely shocked, and 
in some cases irked, by the ramifications of the sanctions -- 
particularly the ban on financial services.  We tried to give 
general advice and explanations about the sanctions, but 
advised all to contact an attorney or OFAC directly to 
discuss specific cases. 
 
3. The U.S. citizens, including representatives of U.S. 
companies and U.S.-based NGOs, were concerned that they would 
not be able to import their personal effects when they 
returned to the United States.  Many have lived in Burma for 
years, and have accumulated Burmese-made products of 
significant value.  Several asked whether there might be some 
kind of waiver for U.S. citizens to carry home personal 
effects, or for those who could prove they had purchased 
Burmese products before the import ban went into effect. 
U.S. citizens conducting business in Burma were quite worried 
that they would no longer be able to get U.S. dollars 
transferred to Burma from the United States or a 
third-country.  The businesspeople agreed that the impact of 
the sanctions would depend in part if the GOB can adapt its 
trade policy to accept letters of credit in currencies other 
than the U.S. dollars. 
 
4. The second briefing filled the American Center auditorium 
beyond capacity and was somewhat more heated than the first. 
Representatives of foreign embassies in Rangoon were upset 
that remittances of dollars into Burma to fund Embassy 
payrolls and operations were not covered by the first general 
license.  Several Ambassadors urged us to pressure Treasury 
to issue such a license for them as soon as possible.  The UN 
representatives were pleased to be included in the initial 
general license, but confused as to how they would be able to 
bring in funds without relying on frozen correspondent 
accounts in the United States.  Many businesspeople and NGO 
representatives asked about the status of payments that fall 
afoul of the remittance ban and asset freeze, whether these 
payments would also be frozen, or merely returned to sender. 
 
5. Action requested:  We would appreciate specific guidance 
on the legality of transactions (both for those with general 
licenses and those without licenses) in U.S. dollars from a 
third-country bank outside the United States, directly to a 
state-owned bank in Burma.  Also, please advise whether U.S. 
dollar letters of credit, even if between a third-country 
bank and a Burmese bank, will become problematic under the 
new law.

1. (SBU) Summary: The new U.S. sanctions on Burma will have a 
negative impact on the economy as a whole, and the garment 
sector in particular.  NGOs believe that the unemployment 
caused by the sharp decline of the garment industry will lead 
to an increase of trafficking in persons and attempted 
emigration.  However, the already massive flood of unemployed 
young women and men seeking economic alternatives will likely 
largely swallow this uptick.  Nonetheless, the U.S. 
government should act quickly to ensure the activities of 
NGOs providing outreach to potential and actual trafficking 
victims are not diminished by the new sanctions.  End summary. 
 
Sanctions Put a Bullet in Garment Sector 
 
2. (SBU) The new Burma sanctions, which among other 
punishments ban imports of Burmese products into the United 
States, are already beginning to have a visible impact on a 
local garment sector already weakened by declining demand and 
poor global competitiveness.  As reported in Refs A and F, 
the predominately private sector-controlled Burmese garment 
industry relies almost exclusively on the U.S. market, and 
the garment manufacturers here have asserted that it will be 
very difficult to replace U.S. customers with European Union 
or Japanese buyers. 
 
3. (SBU) With the garment sector collapse, we estimate that a 
large percentage of the sector\'s estimated 100,000 jobs, 
mostly in the Rangoon area, will be at risk.  In Burma\'s 
dismal economy, these workers, mostly young women, some of 
whom are the primary wage earner for their families, will 
have very few positive economic prospects.  Certainly some 
will be absorbed by the agricultural and informal economic 
sector (selling tea or forest products in the marketplace). 
Others will migrate to the vigorous karaoke and nightclub 
sector of Rangoon to take jobs as hostesses and/or 
prostitutes.  A third group, of indeterminate size, may head 
for the borders to seek opportunities in Thailand or China. 
 
NGOs Uncertain Over Workers\' Future 
 
4. (SBU) According to international NGOs in Rangoon that work 
to prevent trafficking in persons, the new sanctions will 
likely cause an uptick in the number of women seeking to find 
entertainment or sex industry jobs inside Burma, and sex and 
manufacturing industry jobs over the border in Thailand and 
China.  The NGO representatives admitted, though, that the 
ranks of young, unemployed job seekers -- and cases of human 
trafficking as a result -- will swell only slightly by the 
closure of the garment factories.  Job brokers, both 
legitimate and sinister, operating in Burma already benefit 
from a huge supply of potential laborers due to the chronic 
economic problems in Burma, and the relatively strong 
currencies and economies of Thailand and China.  The NGOs 
report that already brokers have increased their fees from 
50,000 kyat (about $50) to 100,000 kyat.  The average garment 
factory employee earns about 12,000-20,000 kyat/month 
($12-$20/month). 
 
5. (SBU) NGOs are concerned about the paucity of legitimate 
employment opportunities inside Burma for the former textile 
workers and other young women.  One NGO told us as part of 
its outreach program it previously assisted young women at 
risk to get jobs at garment factories.  This will no longer 
be an option.  NGOs do not foresee the government taking any 
steps to create new jobs for young women.  In fact the 
government\'s anti-trafficking watchdog, led by SPDC Secretary 
One\'s wife, has announced a campaign to shut down all karaoke 
shops and massage parlors (most of which do not offer sex); a 
step that would cut off a major alternative to outright 
prostitution for jobless girls and women. 
 
GOB Actions Indifferent 
 
6. (SBU) Thus far, the government has done nothing to prepare 
for, or soften, the impact of the factory closures.  Instead, 
senior leaders and their journalistic mouthpieces have been 
making political hay of the \"weapon of mass destruction\" 
launched by the United States to cause \"human rights abuses\" 
and force Burmese girls into \"sexual slavery.\"  Garment 
manufacturers tell us the government has ordered the factory 
owners to pay all employees a severance package equal to 
3-months salary.  However, it\'s yet unclear whether the 
businessmen, already suffering from a 6-month banking crisis 
and a generally poor business situation, will be able to make 
these payments. 
 
7. (SBU) The government also seems prepared to redouble 
efforts to crack down on migration, particularly by women, 
along the most traveled routes to the Thai and Chinese 
borders.  However, NGOs fear, this type of interdiction will 
only force would-be economic migrants to seek alternative, 
more dangerous escape routes. 
 
8. (SBU) It is always possible that the regime will take 
administrative measures to sop up some of the new 
unemployment, such as expanding public works projects or 
forcing private investors to hire a certain number of new 
employees.  However, we\'ve heard only hints and rumors of 
this, and think it possible only if the unemployment begins 
to cause some political ferment in the poorer parts of 
Rangoon. 
 
Comment: Assistance Needed 
 
9. (SBU) While the Burmese government bears ultimate 
responsibility for softening the economic blow to garment 
sector workers, neighboring states and the U.S. government 
should also look at ways of assisting those NGOs who are 
aiding trafficked women and those at risk of being 
trafficked.  There may be opportunities to contribute 
additional U.S. aid to credible INGOs working independently 
of the GOB in the area of trafficking.  However, the 
immediate need is for a liberal general license, waiving 
restrictions imposed by the latest sanctions, for those NGOs 
that remit dollars into Burma.  Punctuating this need, on 
August 8 twenty-six health, education, and environment NGOs 
met with the DCM to complain that without a resolution of the 
remittance problems, they would have to shut down their 
operations within 2-3 weeks.  Indeed, many NGOs reported that 
they were already cutting back their outreach because of the 
inability to replenish funds.

Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Businesses have faced more trouble than they 
expected from the new U.S. sanctions on Burma.  While local 
traders are scurrying to find a creative solution to their 
financial problems, the Burmese government has refused to 
take any action other than attempt to reassure the business 
community with empty promises that \"all will be well.\"  We 
see a number of likely economic consequences coming in the 
short term, though the X-Factor remains any possible policy 
response by the regime.  End summary. 
 
Businesses: Why Me? 
 
2. (C) Those in the business community who rely on banks and 
official trade channels are in a panic over the impact of the 
new Burma sanctions.  Because of the pre-sanctions focus on 
minimizing exposure to the ban on imports of Burmese products 
into the United States, few took the time to understand how 
seriously their operations would be curtailed by the ban on 
financial services.  Because legal, non-border, foreign trade 
in Burma is almost exclusively in U.S. dollars, importers and 
exporters have found themselves unable to open new letters of 
credit and unable to easily get payment on letters of credit 
that weren\'t settled before the sanctions took effect at 
12:01 am EST on July 29. 
 
3. (C) Burmese traders report that their exports and imports 
have ground to a halt as the foreign banks with whom they 
normally do business, mostly in Singapore, have stopped 
honoring letters of credit involving the Burmese state-owned 
foreign trade banks: Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB), 
Myanmar Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), and the 
Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB).  These banks hold the monopoly 
on foreign exchange and official foreign trade transactions. 
 
4. (C) A number of European and Asian investors told us that 
the new obstacles caused by the financial sanctions, combined 
with the dismal pre-existing investment climate, will make it 
impossible to stay in Burma.  A Korean diplomat told the DCM 
that Korean investors in the garment sector (30-40 
individuals or firms) are beginning to seriously explore 
options for decamping to Sri Lanka, Vietnam, or just across 
the border into Thailand.  Those foreign investors that 
choose to remain will likely fall into three categories: 
those who are able to make their money on illegal border 
trade or border trade in Chinese yuan or Thai baht, those who 
can arrange barter trade, and those who foolishly believe the 
sanctions will be lifted as soon as Aung San Suu Kyi is 
released.  This latter bit of wishful thinking is widespread, 
despite our repeated public assurances to the contrary. 
 
5. (C) However, despite their agitation, most local traders 
with whom we spoke were sanguine that they would find a 
creative solution to what is merely the latest obstacle to 
their doing business.  Said one, \"our government has been 
imposing their sanctions on us for 40 years, so we\'ll have no 
trouble adapting to yours.\"  Indeed, some of our more wily 
business contacts report that they\'ve already established new 
modus vivendi to continue their trading businesses without 
problem. 
 
Government: Who Us? 
 
6. (C) According to several business sources, the Ministry of 
Commerce and the Office of the SPDC Chairman co-hosted an 
emergency session on the new sanctions on August 4 for 
Burmese traders.  The well-attended meeting went about one 
hour with presentations by the Minister of Commerce, the 
Minister of Economic Development and National Planning, a 
minister from the SPDC Chairman\'s office, and the Deputy 
Finance Minister.  Despite the augustness of the presenters, 
all reports indicate that the GOB had no advice for the 
panicky businesspeople other than to continue on as best they 
can in the new environment, and to resolve any specific 
concerns with their bankers.  The policymakers offered no 
hint of any pending regime reaction to the new sanctions, and 
only mentioned in passing the wisdom of expanding barter 
trade or conducting commerce in a currency other than the 
U.S. dollar. 
 
7. (C) Businesspeople close to government economic officials 
tell us that the regime is still in a state of denial, poorly 
understanding the full impact of the sanctions on the 
country\'s official trade sector.  Apparently these officials, 
and likely those above them, are still clinging to the 
expectation that China and/or India will come to Burma\'s 
financial assistance -- an expectation that may have some 
merit (see Ref B and C). 
8. (C) Aside from a virulent July 31st attack on U.S. 
sanctions policy by SPDC Secretary One General Khin Nyunt, 
there has been little public GOB response since the sanctions 
were imposed.  A report written for SPDC Secretary Two Lt. 
General Soe Win on the Embassy\'s sanctions briefing on July 
31st (Ref A) was very factual, accurately summarizing the 
briefing\'s contents with no editorial commentary.  Likewise, 
the Minister of Commerce\'s session for traders reportedly 
contained no anti-U.S. rhetoric or finger pointing. 
 
The Future: Who Knows? 
 
9. (C) Over the next few weeks and months, we see the 
following as some of the possible specific consequences of 
the sanctions: unemployment as garment factories and other 
employers shutter for lack of business; a sharp reduction in 
the GOB\'s official reserves as the inflow of legal U.S. 
dollars stops; an increase in the already large, 
predominately U.S. dollar-denominated informal economy 
(especially border trade); a resulting boost for neighboring 
economies and for the ethnic groups that control key border 
trade areas; an increase in the kyat value of the U.S. dollar 
as supplies dwindle and importers must buy cash from the 
marketplace; and, a steady decrease in the kyat value of the 
U.S. dollar denominated Foreign Exchange Certificate.  Though 
the economic problems will ripple through the middle class, 
and then into the working class as unemployment results from 
the expected shuttering of factories and other employers, it 
is far too early to predict any social unrest. 
 
10. (C) The X-Factor is the reaction of the Burmese 
government.  It could ease the woes of local traders by 
publicly encouraging trade in another foreign currency or 
loosening import restrictions (which currently require 
importers to hold offsetting accounts of U.S. dollar export 
proceeds in a government bank account).  It could also go the 
other direction, conserving precious foreign exchange by 
enforcing more strictly existing foreign exchange control 
laws that forbid Burmese citizens from holding foreign 
currency, or tightening import restrictions.

SUBJECT: GOB\'S CONCERNS OVER AUGUST 7 SECURITY INCIDENT 
 
1.  Post has received information from the Department that 
uniformed Secret Service arrested 3 Burmese students at the 
Burmese embassy the morning of August 7 after they tried to 
use a ladder to remove the Burmese flag and replace it with 
their own (a Burmese dissident report on the incident said 
they were attempting to unfurl a banner from a balcony that 
said \"EXPEL THE AMBASSADOR NOW\").  There is also a vigil 
planned by the students for 8:00 p.m. on August 8.  Post 
understands that SS has beefed up security at the chancery 
and the Ambassador\'s residence and that the Burmese will 
request a permanent fixed post. 
 
2.  The COM was called to the Foreign Ministry late Friday 
afternoon, August 8, to meet with the Director General for 
Political Affairs.  The reason for the summons was to 
express the GOB\'s concern over the incident detailed below. 
The DG confirmed that the Burmese Embassy was receiving a 
response to their request for extra security but wanted to 
reiterate the GOB\'s concern, especially as it relates to 
the intrusion into diplomatic premises.  The DG said they 
could \"deal with protests\" but were worried that \"things 
could get out of hand\".  The COM assured the DG that the 
U.S. Government took its responsibility for protecting 
diplomatic missions with the utmost seriousness and that 
she would relay the GOB\'s concern to the Department. 
 
3.  As frequently noted in post\'s reporting on security 
issues, the GOB is very responsive to our requests for 
ongoing security at the Chancery, the American Center, and 
diplomatic residential compounds and they have responded 
positively and quickly to requests for enhanced security 
for special events.  The GOB also provided a bodyguard 
detail for the COM (and offered the same for other Embassy 
senior officers) during the run-up to Iraq and until the 
active fighting was declared over. 
 
4.  Action Request:  Given the physical vulnerabilities of 
our aging USG facilities here, we need continued GOB 
cooperation on security issues.  Post urges that GOB 
requests for upgraded security be met with a timely 
and effective response.

1. (U) Ref A article in the Thai daily Bangkok Siam Rat

deliveries, although they have been denied direct access to 
her.   Asked to comment about rumors of her death, a senior 
Ministry of Defense official told Emboff on August 11 that 
ASSK was \"alive, eating regularly, and even gaining weight.\" 
 
3. (U) Comment:  Without direct access to Aung San Suu Kyi, 
we cannot report with certainty on her current status. 
However, the SPDC maintains an intensely secretive posture 
with regard to her \"protective custody\" and the status of all 
NLD members detained in the aftermath of the May 30 attack on 
her convoy.  As a result, we fully expect that rumors about 
her state of health will continue to flourish.

1. (C) We received a letter dated July 29, addressed to 
President Bush and signed by sixteen rank and file Rangoon 
Division members of the National League for Democracy (NLD). 
A translation of the letter and a copy of the original has 
been pouched to EAP/BCLTV. 
 
2. (C) The letter offered thanks to the President, the 
Congress, and the Senate for \"keeping a conscientious watch 
over the democratic forces of Burma...\" and expressed 
wholehearted support for the Burmese Freedom and Democracy 
Act and the Executive Order.  The letter also promised that 
the signatories would \"join hands in democratic activities 
not only for Burma, but also for the world.\" 
 
3. (C) This seemingly independent and brave move by local NLD 
members to show their support for the sanctions reflects the 
general support for sanctions expressed to us by most average 
Burmese.  Most educated Burmese, not involved in business, 
with whom we spoke have agreed that this government cannot 
understand anything but pressure, and that a certain amount 
of pain is acceptable in the pursuit of democratic change. 
Even businesspeople facing the full brunt of economic 
sanctions privately accede that the SPDC is fully to blame 
for the country\'s economic and political mess and they can 
understand the U.S. policy to take strong action.  The 
beleaguered merchants add, though, that they sincerely hope 
the U.S. policy objectives can soon be attained before too 
much damage is done to the economy and Burmese workers.

REF: A. RANGOON 563 
     B. RANGOON 448 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: With only two or three months remaining 
before rice harvest time, private traders and agronomists are 
dubious that the GOB\'s rice liberalization policy will be a 
real short term success.  Too many uncertainties and holes 
remain for that to happen.  However, all agree that the 
regime will ensure, by bribery and force, that enough private 
sector entities take advantage of the policy for it to be 
deemed a \"success.\"  End summary. 
 
Sanctions Impact Minimal 
 
2. (SBU) According to a private sector agricultural expert 
with whom we spoke, the new U.S. remittance and import bans 
will have little impact on the GOB\'s new, liberalized rice 
policy.  According to the GOB policy, announced suddenly in 
late March 2003, the government will end its 40-year monopoly 
on rice exports as well as its much maligned policy of 
mandatory advanced procurement from farmers at prices well 
below market.  Instead, according to the still sketchy plan, 
the private sector will have the freedom to buy and sell, 
locally and abroad, at whatever price the market will bear. 
Of course the government will maintain some control, sharing 
the export revenues and also procuring rice from merchants at 
cost for domestic need. 
 
3. (SBU) Most of the country\'s rice exports, which are 
extremely low quality, go to francophone West Africa, either 
directly or through a third country as a component of some 
barter arrangement.  Thus, it may be easier to shift the 
currency of the trade from U.S. dollars into euro -- a 
currency of choice, he asserted, for West Africa.  We have 
heard from other sources that the government intends to allow 
letters of credit and other trade facilitation to be carried 
out in other major currencies, but preferably the euro. 
 
Private Sector Dubious 
 
4. (SBU) Though the rice scheme seems on course for some 
success come harvest time in October or November, none of the 
outstanding questions raised in reftels has been answered, 
and there remains little incentive for small traders to get 
involved.  The government\'s policy has not been issued in 
writing, adding an element of uncertainty for potential rice 
exporters.  Likewise, there is no indication that the regime 
will set a price floor to guarantee farmers\' income. 
 
5. (SBU) Though optimistic in theory, small private traders 
are skeptical about the profitability of getting involved 
during this inaugural year.  For one, the export price of 
Burmese rice (mostly poor quality) is quite low, but \"fair\" 
domestic prices tend to be high because of low yields per 
acre and high prices of transportation and imported 
agricultural inputs like fertilizer, diesel fuel, machinery, 
etc.  Also, prospective exporters will have to contend with 
the government\'s intended revenue sharing scheme (explained 
in detail in reftels).  Finally, traders complain, the 
government\'s proposal to procure, at cost, a to-be-determined 
amount of rice for domestic consumption will leave profit 
margins even thinner, and even less predictable. 
 
Guaranteed Success 
 
6. (C) Cynical traders and agricultural economists agree that 
whatever the hurdles, the regime will stack the deck to 
ensure at least an illusion of success for its new gambit. 
Already the government\'s agricultural procurement and trading 
company, Myanmar Agricultural Produce Trading company (MAPT) 
is mobilizing its stocks for possible export using cutout or 
crony private sector firms.  It\'s not unusual for the GOB to 
pressure a private firm to conduct a money losing, but 
politically important, transaction in return for some more 
lucrative contract or concession in another area.  Also, one 
economist reported, the government\'s rice policy guru, SPDC 
Secretary Two Lt. General Soe Win, summoned leaders of the 
 
SIPDIS 
country\'s rice and paddy merchants organization and 
encouraged them to collude to keep a ceiling on domestic 
procurement prices, to ensure as large an export margin as 
possible -- at the expense of local farmers. 
 
GOB Deals From the Bottom 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: Until the harvest and export seasons begin 
in earnest at the end of this year, we\'ll not be able to 
comment authoritatively on the new rice strategy\'s 
effectiveness.  Though we still feel the plan is an important 
and generally positive move, four months after the its 
announcement we are less convinced than before that this is 
the first of many agricultural reforms.  Likewise, based on 
the regime\'s lackluster efforts to flesh out other recent 
economic \"policies\" (such as those to resolve the banking 
crisis and deal with sanctions), we are dubious that the GOB 
will make the effort to address the many nagging and 
expensive, but crucial, details that would aid the policy\'s 
ultimate triumph.  Instead, we think the regime will 
typically first try administrative solutions to make sure 
there is a neat facade of success, no matter the reality. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMESE DEPUTY FM: \"U.S-BURMA RELATIONS AT ROCK 
BOTTOM\" 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Burma\'s Deputy Foreign Minister (DFM) told 
us on August 12 that the country\'s ruling generals are deeply 
upset with new U.S. sanctions and concerned about their 
impact on the Burmese economy, but feel confident they can 
mitigate any negative consequences.  He said that the 2003 
Burma Freedom and Democracy Act and Executive Order 13310 had 
sent U.S.-Burma relations to \"rock bottom\" and that there 
needed to be a cooling off period before progress on 
bilateral issues could resume.  The DFM demurred on our 
request to see detained NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi and 
declined to specify a timetable for the release of ASSK or 
other detained NLD leaders.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The Chief of Mission met at her request on August 12 
with Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win to discuss a 
variety of bilateral issues and to inquire about his July 
travels throughout the region.  The DFM said that SPDC 
Chairman General Than Shwe had sent him as a personal envoy 
to \"let friends know about the situation (in Burma) and to 
address their concerns.\"  He did not offer specific details 
about his meetings with regional leaders, but intimated that 
his discussions in Japan and Malaysia had been difficult.  He 
said he received a \"sympathetic\" hearing in Brunei, 
Singapore, and the Philippines, noting that Philippine 
President Arroyo had made herself personally available 
\"despite serious domestic challenges.\" 
 
ASSK Transfer? 
-------------- 
 
3. (C) The DFM said that he had faithfully reported to the 
SPDC generals the content of his July discussions in New York 
with EAP DAS Matt Daley, including his message that the GOB 
would transfer detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi 
(ASSK) to her Rangoon compound for continued \"protective 
custody\" if the authorities were not in a position to release 
her altogether.  The COM urged the DFM to obtain permission 
for her to visit ASSK and to immediately release NLD 
executive committee members under house arrest.  When the 
Pol/Econ chief pressed for a specific timeline to transfer or 
release ASSK, the Deputy FM cringed and said \"I will not push 
(the generals) on this issue.\"  The COM urged the DFM to 
arrange for her to meet personally with General Khin Nyunt 
(SPDC Secretary One) with whom she would directly pursue the 
issue of ASSK\'s detention. 
 
The Generals Finally Get the Message 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) The DFM said he had told DAS Daley in New York that 
the GOB hoped to return to the political status quo that 
existed before the May 30 \"incident\" (note: the premeditated 
attack on ASSK and her convoy), but that the Burma Act and 
Executive Order had sent U.S.-Burma relations to rock bottom. 
 The Deputy FM described the SDPC generals as \"very upset\" 
with the sanctions and said they were deeply offended by a 
photo of the Oval Office signing ceremony and the \"apparent 
joy\" of those present (President Bush and several Members of 
Congress).  The Deputy FM said that as a result of the 
sanctions, nothing at the moment could be accomplished 
bilaterally, particularly on those issues discussed with DAS 
Daley.  He said the GOB did not feel compelled to make 
concessions because of the sanctions, but noted that his 
government was realistic and expected there to be a serious 
impact on the economy.  He added, though, that the GOB is 
\"confident we can mitigate the consequences\" of the new 
sanctions. 
 
5. (C) The COM told the Deputy FM that it was indeed the 
intent of the E.O. to make the Burmese leadership concerned, 
noting that it is incumbent upon the GOB to release ASSK and 
other NLD detainees in order create the conditions necessary 
for a return to dialogue.  She added that the Deputy FM 
should tell the senior SPDC leadership that despite the 
severity of the executive order, there are provisions to lift 
sanctions if conditions warrant, which demonstrates the hope 
of the USG that the SPDC will act accordingly.  DFM Khin 
Maung Win replied that \"we need a cooling down period\" and 
said he was not in a position to comment on the status of the 
NLD leaders, but that his availability to meet with the COM 
was a sign that \"the door is open to dialogue\" (note: the GOB 
has been more unresponsive than usual over the past month to 
our requests for meetings with senior officials). 
 
6. (C) The COM also inquired about visits to Burma by U.N. 
envoys, noting in particular that the U.S. fully supports the 
return of UNCHR Special Rapporteur Pinherio and his human 
rights team to follow up on his most recent mission.  The DFM 
said he had spoken that morning with U.N. Special Envoy 
Razali and, although Razali had expressed his desire to 
return to Burma immediately, the DFM said it was a \"matter of 
timing\" before any visits of either U.N. envoy could be 
arranged. 
 
 
Comment:  Flatfooted? 
--------------------- 
 
7. (C) We have long suspected that GOB officials are 
reluctant to deliver bad news to the ruling generals.  Deputy 
Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win\'s repeated references to the 
ire of the SPDC leaders over new U.S. sanctions leads us to 
believe that no one adequately prepared the isolated generals 
for the broad impact of the import ban and the assets freeze. 
 The DFM himself seemed surprised that, in his words, the 
executive order had cast a wider net than the Burma Act 
passed by Congress.  The GOB has been very slow to recover 
from the initial impact of the sanctions (and they have 
repeatedly declined our open offer for a briefing on the 
technical aspects of the executive order).  Perfectly 
illustrating the GOB\'s state of ignorance regarding 
sanctions, the Deputy FM inquired \"off the record\" as to how 
his business \"friends\" could apply for a general license to 
gain access to funds frozen in U.S. bank accounts.  That, we 
told him, is just the point: the sanctions are intended to 
send a clear and unambiguous message that the time is over 
for business as usual.  End comment.

1.  (C)   Summary:  The Japanese Ambassador to Burma says 
that he will urge his Deputy Foreign Minister to address next 
steps in Burma during a September meeting with Deputy 
Secretary Armitage.  He advocates that the U.S. and Japan 
 
SIPDIS 
quietly collaborate in developing a package of carrots and 
sticks to entice and prod the SPDC toward political reform. 
The Ambassador, known for his pro-engagement stance, does not 
appear to be in sync with Tokyo\'s evolving Burma policy.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (C)   On August 14, the Japanese Ambassador to Burma, 
Yuji Miyamoto met with the COM to discuss views on next steps 
in Burma.  Miyamoto said that Japanese Deputy Foreign 
Minister Takeuchi would meet with Deputy Secretary Armitage 
in Washington on September 5 and he, the Ambassador, was 
hopeful that the two senior officials would discuss 
developments in Burma (note: the Japanese here do not appear 
to be aware of SE Asia Division Director Yamanouchi\'s 
tentatively scheduled meeting with EAP DAS Daley on September 
3, per reftel A). 
 
3.  (C)  Ambassador Miyamoto said that he would propose to 
his headquarters that Tokyo and Washington talk in secret to 
\"form a grand design\" for supervising constructive change in 
Burma.  He would urge that a package of \"carrots\" be 
developed to balance existing sticks (sanctions, suspended 
assistance, etc.) aimed at Burma\'s military regime.  Miyamoto 
said he was frustrated with the lack of progress in Rangoon 
and offered his view that U.N. special envoy Razali needed to 
be in a position to offer more to the SPDC in exchange for a 
return to dialogue and transition to democracy. 
 
4.  (C)  Miyamoto said that the GOJ supported the Thai 
roadmap in principle, but that ownership of the plan had to 
shift to Razali and/or ASEAN because the Burmese would never 
trust the Thais or accept the possibility that Thailand could 
one day claim responsibility for democratizing Burma.  He 
criticized Thai politicians for pandering to their own 
constituencies and using public venues, rather than discrete 
diplomacy, to advance the roadmap. 
 
5.  (C)  Ambassador Miyamoto affirmed that Japan would not 
undertake new assistance programs in Burma, nor would it 
renew programs that expire or run their natural course.  He 
noted, however, that he had yet to receive an official 
directive from Tokyo on GOJ assistance policy and added that 
Deputy Foreign Minister Takeuchi, a hardliner on Burma 
policy, might be \"shuffled\" away from his current portfolio 
following party elections in late September. 
 
6.  (C)  Miyamoto said that he meets regularly with SPDC 
ministers, and generally writes SPDC Secretary One General 
Khin Nyunt every two or three weeks.  He said his consistent 
message to the Burmese was that Burma-Japan relations had 
entered a new, and unwelcome, phase following the May 30 
attack against Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) and her NLD convoy. 
The generals must endeavor to restore the dialogue process, 
he tells the GOB, and they should also avoid the trap of 
counting on India and China for moral and financial support. 
 
7.  (C)  Miyamoto concluded with his view that, despite 
rumors to the contrary, the SPDC would not release ASSK 
before the ASEAN summit in October.  He said that the 
generals would not risk being viewed domestically as 
responsive to international pressure.  Furthermore, he added, 
the SPDC would only release ASSK in the short term if she 
made political concessions, which Miyamoto quickly 
acknowledged the opposition leader would never do. 
 
8.  (C)  Comment:  Ambassador Miyamoto, prior to May 30, was 
well known for his articulate defense of unconditional 
engagement with the SPDC as a means of effecting political 
change in Burma.  He has changed his tune in the aftermath of 
the premeditated attack, but does not yet appear to have 
caught up with Tokyo\'s view that the first priority is to 
seek the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.  The COM told Miyamoto 
that we have not seen the Thai roadmap, nor endorsed the 
concept, but agreed that such an approach must be 
multilateral and not bilateral.

1. (C) Summary: Hints of two informal trade policy changes 
(an attempted shift from the dollar to the euro and 
unofficial liberalization of border trade) may steer the 
post-sanctions environment in a clearer direction.  Border 
trade will boom, especially if the regime is serious about 
reforms on the frontier.  However, \"normal\" trade will 
decline despite a GOB promise to accept euros as legal 
foreign exchange.  In the meantime, businesses are still 
frozen, carefully weighing their options before committing 
money to any new trading mechanism.  The SPDC leadership 
remains defiant, confident that dents to the state\'s coffers 
will not impact personal wealth and power.  End summary. 
 
Policy of Winks and Nods 
 
2. (C) On August 10, the SPDC Chairman\'s office and the 
Ministry of Commerce co-chaired a second meeting of 
entrepreneurs to discuss the impact of and responses to the 
new U.S. sanctions, especially the ban on financial services. 
 Burma\'s dollarized economy and trading system absorbed a 
staggering blow, for which it was totally unprepared, when 
financial transactions could suddenly no longer be cleared 
through the United States.  The blow was exacerbated when 
several Singapore banks, the nexus of Burma\'s commerce, 
refused to engage in any Burma-related transactions outside 
of Singapore. 
 
3. (C) Typically no clear policy pronouncements emerged from 
this session; however, several attendees reported to us that 
they interpreted two potentially significant shifts in GOB 
trade policy from the circumlocution and vague \"instructions\" 
issued by the five ministers present. 
 
4. (C) The first is that the government is apparently now 
accepting non-U.S. dollar foreign currencies for official 
remittances and Letters of Credit (L/Cs).  The euro is the 
currency of choice, with euro accounts allegedly available 
for the first time in the state-owned foreign trade banks. 
The GOB is also apparently now requiring all overseas Burmese 
who remit their salaries to a state-owned bank to do so in 
euros, yen, or Singapore dollars -- though only euro accounts 
will be allowed.  Likewise, state-owned enterprises must do 
remittances and L/Cs in euros. 
 
5. (C) The second significant change hinted at is an 
unofficial liberalization of border trade.  There were no 
details of this liberalization given by the ministers in 
their presentations.  However, one businessman reported that 
during a coffee break one of the ministers implied that 
foreign exchange regulations would be unofficially loosened 
to allow individuals and companies to hold foreign exchange, 
especially \"border\" currencies (baht, yuan, rupee, etc.). 
Also, import license approval authority will be devolved to 
local Commerce Ministry Border Trade Division authorities, 
who are reportedly more lenient with import license requests. 
 Currently, all import license requests, including those for 
border trade, must be cleared in Rangoon.  Over the last 
several months importers report that central government 
authorities have been granting at most 25 percent of their 
requests. 
 
What Does It All Mean? 
 
6. (C) Traders and economists from all quarters agree on 
three things.  First, trade has ground to a halt as companies 
come out of their initial shock and seek alternatives to get 
their businesses rolling again.  Second, whatever these 
alternatives may be, they will not, for the most part, rely 
on normal trade involving banks inside Burma.  Finally, 
recovery will be very slow as no trader will want to be the 
first to dip a toe into the uncharted waters of the 
government\'s unpublished policy changes. 
 
7. (C) Those who can most easily shift from formal trade 
using Burmese banks to other methods will survive most easily 
in the new reality.  Border trade, legal and illegal, ought 
to boom, with legal trade prevailing if the regime is more 
transparent regarding policy changes.  Traders agree that 
imports, especially consumer and intermediate goods but even 
some capital goods, will be most easily shiftable to the 
border.  If the GOB is serious about liberalizing border 
trade, there will likely be an upsurge in imports due to 
unmet demand for consumer goods such as cooking oil. 
However, transportation difficulties and the greater expense 
of border trade may push up the prices of such imports. 
Exports are not as transferable, since much of the 
government\'s exports go to non-bordering countries.  One 
trader estimated that 60 percent of the current total import 
volume could be done via border trade, while only 20 percent 
of exports could be carried out that way. 
8. (C) Without a clearer GOB policy and more liquidity in the 
market, it is unlikely that formal trade in euros, or other 
non-U.S. dollar currency, will catch on.  Some euro L/Cs may 
be opened in the short term to clear the pipeline of deals 
already signed and import licenses granted but not yet used. 
Also, euro L/Cs would be available for third country banks 
skittish of doing dollar transactions involving Burma. 
However, traders felt that most trade requiring an L/C would 
transpire in dollars outside of Burma (i.e., between a third 
country bank and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank\'s account in 
Singapore), with the proceeds delivered to Burma via hondi 
(informal remittances), courier, or account balancing. 
Barter, counter, and \"import first\" trade are also likely to 
take hold, especially in the official sector, though the 
regime has not yet endorsed this method of trade for private 
firms.  All of these methods, though, will involve extra 
expense and administrative effort, further muddying already 
murky business waters. 
 
9. (C) The government\'s (as opposed to the SPDC leadership\'s) 
pocketbook is likely to suffer with the shifting trade 
situation.  Without some commitment to the hinted trade 
policy reforms, most border trade will move into the \"black\" 
and \"gray\" sectors, which pay more bribes than customs 
duties.  Fewer exports also mean reduced income from the 10 
percent export tax.  A trade deficit is likely for the next 
year, which will put upward pressure on kyat as will the 
steady demand for U.S. dollars by businesses, NGOs, and 
government officials.  Though sanctions may reduce the 
country\'s official dollarization, the U.S. dollar will likely 
remain everyone\'s preferred liquid commodity.  The government 
can only control the exchange rate by arresting money 
changers and restricting the official outflow of foreign 
exchange by manipulating import licenses.  Neither of these 
is sustainable, especially if more and more trade moves out 
of the central government\'s domain. 
 
Government Reaction: Hurt Feelings, But Defiant 
 
10. (C) Despite the obvious economic damage being done to the 
country by sanctions, none of our contacts believes members 
of the SPDC are being materially hurt.  As one senior Burmese 
economist put it, \"the country\'s leaders\' riches and power 
are not linked at all to the prosperity of the country.\" 
Though there is certainly a psychological impact on the 
regime (see Ref A), our reports indicate that this angst is 
being channeled into defiance and spine stiffening.  Among 
the regime\'s senior leadership is the reported prevailing 
sentiment that the SPDC will not be seen as \"kneeling down\" 
to the United States or Aung San Suu Kyi.

encouraging, if a bit precocious considering the country\'s 
decrepit economic state.  However, the realities are not as 
impressive: the Internet remains heavily censored and well 
beyond the means of all but a few individuals and businesses, 
the few cyber cafes that have opened to date are losing 
money, and the regime and its cronies retain a monopoly on 
provision of Internet services.  End summary. 
 
Background: Internet in Burma 
 
2. (U) The first stab at \"wiring\" Burma came in 1998-99 when 
a private company began offering e-mail service.  The GOB, 
planning at about the same time to introduce its own e-mail 
and Internet service through parastatal Myanma Post and 
Telecommunications (MPT), expropriated the private business 
and officially \"introduced\" the Internet to Burma in 2000 
through the mptmail.net.mm domain.  Later, the military 
controlled \"private\" IT firm Bagan Cybertech took over as the 
country\'s primary Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Bagan 
Cybertech constructed the Bagan IDC & Teleport facility at 
the shiny new Myanmar Information and Communications 
Technology (MICT) Park in Rangoon in 2002.  Since then, Bagan 
Cybertech has provided censored Internet and Bagan Net 
(Intranet) access to private companies and individuals. 
 
3. (U) Bagan Net is available to most all who can afford the 
exhorbitant, by local standards, start up and usage fees.  It 
currently offers about 2,000 sites and has roughly 16,000 
subscribers.  According to one IT industry representative, 
companies and individuals can apply to Bagan Cybertech to add 
specific sites to the Intranet, and Bagan Cybertech usually 
approves these applications -- unless the site is 
objectionable.  Internet access, which is available only to 
carefully vetted individuals, companies, and the diplomatic, 
UN, and NGO communities, has many Internet sites accessible. 
However, all obvious anti-government websites such as 
BurmaNet and Irrawaddy are blocked.  Likewise pornographic 
sites, some religious sites, and free e-mail sites (e.g., 
Hotmail, Yahoo) are blocked.  There are about 1,000 current 
Internet subscribers.  Authorities of Bagan Cybertech, in 
full collaboration with Military Intelligence (MI), have 
complete authority to make decisions on granting Internet or 
Intranet access after investigating applicants. 
 
4. (SBU) The cost for Internet access is still high for 
ordinary people, especially to get broadband -- essential in 
a country with a decrepit telecommunications infrastructure. 
Bagan Cybertech is selling an Internet package with optional 
broadband wireless telephone line for an astronomical $19,000 
for individuals and $22,000 for private companies.  Aside 
from the cost of the telephone line, Bagan Cybertech has 
several packages for Intranet service which range from 8,000 
kyat (about $8) a month for 10 hours to 40,000 kyat (about 
$40) a month for unlimited usage.  All packages require a 
60,000 kyat ($60) annual fee and provide one e-mail account. 
Bagan Cybertech\'s Internet packages, available to only 
handpicked individuals and companies, is far more expensive. 
Private customers pay 24,000 kyat ($24) a month for 20 hours 
or 72,000 kyat ($72) a month for unlimited use.  Companies 
are charged 76,000 kyat ($76) a month for unlimited usage. 
The average Burmese worker makes about 500-800 kyat/day, so 
the cost of Intranet/Internet access is out of reach to all 
but expatriates and the wealthiest Burmese. 
 
Cyber Cafes: An Unecessary Luxury For Most 
 
5. (SBU) The government, which has rhetorically made IT 
development a key plank in its platform of \"modernization\" of 
the Golden Land, announced in mid-2003 that select private 
firms would be given permission to open cyber cafes.  These 
cafes would ostensibly give the general public access to the 
rarefied Internet (vs. Intranet) without the huge expense or 
invasive vetting procedure.  The option to open a cafe would 
be given to the fifty shareholders of the Myanmar Information 
and Communications Technology Development Corporation 
(MICTDC), an IT development and \"venture capital\" firm funded 
and controlled by the government but operated by Bagan 
Cybertech and fifty private firms.  In May, the first two 
companies, Maykha Networks Co. and Fortune International Co., 
bit on the offer.  Subsequently nine other companies opened 
internet cafes in the Rangoon area, and twenty-one total 
licenses were issued.  Maykha Networks Co. is owned by Dr. Ye 
Naing Win, son of SPDC Secretary One, General Khin Nyunt, and 
Fortune International Co., which now has three cafes open, is 
run by a successful businessman with close government ties. 
Dr. Ye Naing Win also runs Bagan Cybertech. 
6. (SBU) The other companies given licenses thus far to open 
cyber cafes are: 
 
1)    CTT Co. 
2)    Geocomp Co. 
3)    Intelet Co. 
4)    KMD Co. 
5)    MCC Co. 
6)    Myanmar Datacom Co. 
7)    Maxtech Co. 
8)    MIT Co. 
9)    Noble Land Co. 
10)   TKK Co. 
11)   United Engineering Co. 
12)   Winner Co. 
13)   Forever Group Co. 
14)   Cyber Land 
15)   Yuzana Group. Ltd. 
16)   Myanmar Millenium Group. 
17)   Raynet 
 
7. (U) On top of paying initial equipment and Internet 
hook-up costs, private firms wishing to open a cyber cafe 
must shell out 200,000 kyat ($200) for a license and pay 
50,000 kyat ($50) a month to MICTDC.  Rent and other 
operating costs for the cafes run about 1.5 million to 2 
million kyat ($1,500-$2,000) per month.  Initially the new 
cyber cafes charged 1,000 kyat ($1) per hour for Internet 
access, but raised their fees to 1,500 kyat per hour 
beginning in June.  The cafes are open to all comers, but 
each visitor (Burmese and foreigner) must register, giving 
detailed personal data in exchange for a login number that 
can be used by authorities to track an individual\'s site 
visits.  Access to the Internet via a cyber cafe does not 
include a private e-mail account. 
 
Still in the Red 
 
8. (SBU) Surfing at a cyber cafe is extremely expensive for 
ordinary people, and Internet awareness and education are 
still quite low for the average Burmese.  Thus the cyber cafe 
pioneers are not yet turning a profit.  One cyber cafe 
manager said he needed at least 45 visitor/hours per day -- a 
steep target in these tough economic times.  However, 
profitability is not likely the first priority.  Several 
officials from companies that have opened, or who are 
considering opening cyber cafes, admitted that they\'d done no 
market research or business analysis of any sort.  Some 
opened the cafes as learning centers for their more 
profitable computer classes, others may be giving in to 
government pressure to advance the regime objective of a 
\"wired Burma,\" possibly in return for a lucrative favor later 
on.

1. (C) Summary: According to the Thai Ambassador to Burma, 
the Burmese regime has yet to offer any official or 
substantive reaction to the Thai \"roadmap.\"  Although the 
Thai Embassy here has not been included in RTG efforts to 
garner support for the roadmap, the Thai ambassador believes 
that the proposal will not succeed unless it becomes a 
multilateral effort.  That said, he expects the SPDC will 
proceed on its own terms without regard to international 
proposals or pressure.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Thai Ambassador Oum Maolanon, joined by political 
counselor Kallayana Vipattipumiprates, met on August 18 with 
COM and pol/econ chief to discuss recent Burma-related 
developments.  Maolanon said that he had not yet seen the 
Thai \"roadmap\" for Burma, but he understood it to be a 
lengthy and comprehensive document.  He noted that the 
proposal was the product of \"only two or three senior Thai 
officials, including specific input from Foreign Minister 
Surakiart.\"  Ambassador Maolanon observed that he had 
received no instructions from Bangkok to pursue the roadmap 
with the GOB and intimated he was perplexed at why the issue 
was being handled without Thai Embassy involvement. 
 
3. (C) Maolanon reported that to date the SPDC has yet to 
respond to Thai overtures.  Maolanon anticipated a reaction 
late on August 18 when Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win 
summoned him to MOFA headquarters.  However, Maolanon and 
Kallayana later revealed to the COM that the meeting with the 
DFM was a \"weird\" encounter that lasted less than three 
minutes.  Maolanon said the DFM handed over some papers of an 
administrative nature, but he had no official communication 
for the Thai Prime Minister or Foreign Minister and said 
nothing about the roadmap, other than to comment that \"the 
leaders are engaged in internal discussions.\" 
 
4. (C) Maolanon offered his view that the Burmese were 
unlikely to accept a bilateral proposal from Thailand as a 
roadmap for next steps.  He said that any such proposal would 
have to be a larger multilateral effort to be palatable to 
the SPDC, but added that the Burmese generals would move 
ahead only on their own terms--including any decision related 
to the release of detained NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi.  He 
agreed that ASEAN members would be unhappy to have the Burma 
crisis dominate October ASEAN meetings in Bali, and suggested 
that the SPDC may try to find some breathing room by 
transferring ASSK from detention at an undisclosed location 
to house arrest at her Rangoon compound. 
 
5. (C) Bio note:  Ambassador Maolanon will finish his three 
year tour in Burma in the coming months and return to Bangkok 
where he expects to be take up duties in October at the MFA 
as Director General of American and South Pacific Affairs.

\"COMPROMISE\" 
 
REF: RANGOON 993 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The Japanese Embassy in Rangoon is quietly 
pursuing a proposal, apparently endorsed by a senior GOJ MOFA 
official who visited Burma on August 20, that would require 
Aung San Suu Kyi\'s commitment to turn a blind eye to the 
violent May 30 attack on her convoy in exchange for her 
release and a resumption of political dialogue.  We can 
appreciate the GOJ\'s frustration with the political stalemate 
in Burma, but we don\'t believe such a drastic compromise on 
the part of ASSK or the NLD is in the cards.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) According to Japanese Embassy Political Counselor 
Ichiro Maruyama, an unnamed senior official of MOFA\'s Asia 
Pacific Division made a quiet visit to Rangoon on August 20 
and met with Brigadier General Kyaw Thein (Chief of Staff for 
military intelligence) to discuss the current political 
crisis in Burma.  The MOFA official stopped off in Rangoon 
after a swing through SE Asia, including a meeting in Kuala 
Lumpur with U.N. Special Envoy Razali (Note: We believe the 
MOFA official may have been Asia Pacific Division Deputy DG 
Shinichi or SE Asia Division Director Yamanouchi.  End note). 
 
3. (C) Maruyama told the Pol/Econ chief that the Japanese 
Embassy has developed a proposal for the SPDC, apparently 
endorsed by the visiting MOFA official, which would involve 
an agreement between Burma\'s military regime and detained NLD 
leader Aung San Suu Kyi to make respective compromises aimed 
at resolving the current stalemate.  Under the Japanese 
proposal, ASSK would agree not to criticize the May 30 attack 
on her convoy in north central Burma, and in turn the SPDC 
would agree to release her from detention, resume a political 
dialogue, and produce a timeline for a transition to 
democracy. 
 
4. (C) Pol/Econ chief opined that ASSK and the NLD were 
unlikely to agree to turn a blind eye to a premeditated 
attack and subsequent crackdown that had resulted in scores 
of NLD members and supporters killed, for which the SPDC has 
offered no apology nor admitted any role.  Maruyama agreed 
and said the proposal was a long shot, but responded that the 
GOJ is eager to undertake any effort that can help resolve 
the current crisis.  Asked if the GOJ had pursued permission 
from the SPDC to see ASSK, Maruyama said the MOFA official 
had requested a visit, but military intelligence officials 
replied with an emphatic \"no\" and explained that SPDC 
Chairman Than Shwe alone made all decisions related to ASSK\'s 
detention. 
 
5. (C) According to Maruyama, the Japanese Embassy will 
quietly pursue their proposal with the SPDC and if there is 
sufficient interest in the \"compromise\" scenario, PM Koizumi 
will phone SPDC Chairman Than Shwe to discuss details. 
Maruyama said that the GOJ believes a credible international 
mediator is necessary to carry out the proposal, but that 
Special Envoy Razali, the most likely candidate, is 
frustrated with the situation in Burma and has been 
repeatedly denied a visa for a return visit to Rangoon.  The 
GOJ is therefore giving consideration to consulting with the 
U.S. and ASEAN to identify a special mediator who would 
complement, or even replace, Razali and his dialogue efforts. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  Maruyama, like his Ambassador (reftel), 
favors engaging the Burmese regime and is displeased with his 
government\'s decision to suspend new assistance from Japan to 
Burma.  He and his colleagues have excellent contacts with 
the Burmese military intelligence who report that the SPDC is 
looking for a face-saving opportunity to release ASSK. 
However, the Japanese Embassy does not have close ties to the 
NLD and we suspect that any effort to pursue such a drastic 
compromise -- one that would require ASSK to overlook to 
worst setback to the democracy movement in over a decade -- 
will fall flat.

Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) According to local military and civilian contacts, the 
ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has ordered 
the formation of a \"People\'s Militia\" (\"Pyi-thu-sit\" in 
Burmese) in the administrative division of Rangoon.  Military 
commanders allegedly issued written instructions ordering 
local authorities to provide at least 200 persons from each 
of the division\'s 45 townships, which includes the capital 
city of Rangoon, to begin service by the end of August.  The 
instructions also stated that military officials would 
provide each of the division\'s roughly 9,000 \"volunteers\" 
with meals, a daily wage of 200 Kyat (about 20 cents), basic 
military training \"to protect (Burma) from subversive dangers 
such as a U.S.-led invasion.\" 
 
2. (C) Local sources also claim that since July the Myanmar 
War Veterans Organization (MWVO) has played a leading role in 
training female members of the regime\'s so-called \"social 
associations,\" such as the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare 
Association (MMCWA), in basic defense techniques.  Former 
military officers apparently equip the women members with 
bamboo poles for attack exercises and instruct them to defend 
their families against \"external forces.\"  Emboffs have 
witnessed ragtag platoons of women, armed with assorted poles 
and sticks and dressed in assorted uniforms, drilling in the 
Rangoon area in recent weeks (Note: SPDC Adjutant-General Lt. 
General Thein Sein chairs the Central Organizing Committee of 
veteran\'s organization (MWVO) and SPDC Chairman Senior 
General Than Shwe is the official patron.  Dr. Khin Win Shwe, 
wife of SPDC Secretary-1 General Khin Nyunt, chairs the 
maternal and child welfare organization (MMCWA).  End note) 
 
Comment: The Enemy Within 
------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The creation of a People\'s Militia would be the next 
logical step in the militarization of a country whose 
governing and economic functions are almost wholly 
administered by military authorities.  Local officials in 
Rangoon Division reported to our contacts that the formation 
of the Rangoon \"Pyi-thu-sit\" is an exercise designed to 
prepare the local population for an invasion of enemy forces 
from outside of the country.  Such propaganda is expected 
from the regime, particularly in the wake of new U.S. 
sanctions and in unison with SPDC opposition to U.S.-led 
action in Iraq, and is also indicative of rising 
anti-American sentiment propagated by some senior officials. 
 
4. (C) It is uncertain whether SPDC Chairman Than Shwe, Vice 
Chairman Maung Aye, and other regime leaders truly believe 
military action against Burma is realistic.  However, the 
SPDC is quite capable of creating and training a militia as a 
pretext for more aggressive tactics aimed at internal 
opponents of the regime, including the NLD and its 
supporters.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURMESE GENERAL KHIN NYUNT AS PRIME MINISTER: 
PROMOTION OR DEMOTION? 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  SPDC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe\'s 
unexpected August 25 realignment of Burma\'s military and 
government hierarchy may undercut SPDC Secretary-1 General 
Khin Nyunt, the regime\'s number three leader.  Khin Nyunt\'s 
new assignment as Prime Minister is expected to be largely 
ceremonial and his continued control of the powerful military 
intelligence portfolio may be temporary.  Chairman Than Shwe 
also ousted five cabinet members regarded as Khin Nyunt 
supporters, and replaced them with his own proteges, four 
generals and a retired colonel.  The new changes are 
consistent with Than Shwe\'s consolidation of power that began 
with the marginalization, and subsequent death last year, of 
former strongman Ne Win.  We do not expect at this point that 
the new alignment will lead the regime to change its tune on 
the NLD or alter its defiance of the international community. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
CH-CH-CH-CHANGES 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C) In the GOB\'s normal evening radio news broadcast on 
August 25, the SPDC announced that Chairman Than Shwe had 
appointed General Khin Nyunt, formerly the regime\'s number 
three man, as Prime Minister.  Than Shwe, who previously held 
the Prime Minister job himself, also promoted the regime\'s 
number four man, Lt General Soe Win, to replace Khin Nyunt, 
and Lt General Thein Sein (a former regional commander) to 
move up to SPDC Secretary-2. 
 
3. (C) Khin Nyunt\'s replacement as S-1, Soe Win, is the 
reputed planner and executioner of the May 30 \"Black Friday\" 
ambush of NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and a Than Shwe 
loyalist who was earlier this year promoted to Lt General and 
elevated to the S-2 position.  The same broadcast also 
announced the retirement of five marginal GOB ministers, all 
of whom were regarded as Khin Nyunt supporters.  Among those 
ousted was General David Abel, the only non-Buddhist member 
of the cabinet and the regime\'s former economic guru, held in 
high regard by Burma\'s business and diplomatic communities. 
 
WHO\'S IN, WHO,S OUT 
------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Embassy sources agree that the Prime Minister 
appointment \"bumps\" Khin Nyunt up and out of the way, 
depending if he retains control of military intelligence and 
his seat on the SPDC.  Significantly, none of the newly 
appointed ministers are known to be Khin Nyunt supporters. 
The new Secretary-1, Lt General Soe Win, is considered a 
faithful \"yes man\" to Than Shwe.  He is widely assumed to be 
the mastermind and the on-scene commander of the SPDC\'s 
violent ambush on ASSK and her NLD convoy in Depeyin on May 
30.  Than Shwe only recently elevated Soe Win within the SPDC 
to the long-vacant post of Secretary-2, then shortly after 
promoted him to Lieutenant General.  New to the top hierarchy 
is Lt General Thein Sein as SPDC Secretary-2, who vaulted 
over several other generals for the regime\'s number four 
position. 
 
NEWLY APPOINTED 
--------------- 
 
5. (C) The new SPDC and cabinet changes, according to the 
official GOB announcement (brief bio notes in parentheses): 
 
General Khin Nyunt, Prime Minister (former SPDC Secretary-1 
and currently holds the military intelligence portfolio as 
Chief of OCMI). 
 
Lt General Soe Win, SPDC Secretary-1 (former SPDC S-2, USDA 
Central Executive Committee member, mastermind of May 30 
attack). 
 
Lt General Thein Sein, SPDC Secretary-2 (former Adjutant 
General, USDA Rangoon Division Chair, Myanmar War Veterans 
Organization Chairman, responsible for organizing new 
\"People\'s Militias\"). 
 
U Ko Lay, Minister at the Prime Minister\'s Office (former 
Rangoon Mayor, USDA leader, retired colonel). 
 
Major General Thein Swe, Minister at the Prime Minister\'s 
Office (former OCMI Department head, Air Force Officer, son 
runs Myanmar Times). 
 
Brigadier General Thura Myint Maung, Minister for Religious 
Affairs (former Deputy Minister for Home Affairs, is a USDA 
leader). 
 
Brigadier General Thein Aung, Minister for Forestry (former 
Deputy Minister for Energy, USDA leader). 
 
Major General Htay Oo, Minister for Cooperatives (former 
regional commanding officer). 
 
Retired: 
 
Lt General Min Thein, Minister at the SPDC Chairman\'s Office 
Brigadier General Abel, Minister at the SPDC Chairman\'s Office 
U Pan Aung, Minister at the Prime Minister\'s Office (retired 
military officer) 
Lt General Tin Ngwe, Minister for Cooperatives 
U Aung Khin, Minister for Religious Affairs (retired military 
officer) 
 
 
COMMENT:  IS KHIN NYUNT OUT? 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The changes appear to be a continuation of Than 
Shwe,s 10-year effort to consolidate power.  In 2002, Than 
Swe ordered the arrest of family members of former strongman 
Ne Win for alleged coup plotting, signaling the demise of Ne 
Win\'s quiet, but firm, influence on the SPDC.  Ne Win died 
with little fanfare last year, apparently creating an opening 
for Than Shwe, should he so choose, to further marginalize 
Khin Nyunt, a former Ne Win favorite. 
 
7.  (C) One wild card in this realignment, however, is 
whether Prime Minister Khin Nyunt will keep his position as 
the Chief of OCMI, the Gestapo-fashioned military 
intelligence apparatus that keeps all of Burma\'s government, 
military, and society in check.  With the intelligence 
portfolio, he has teeth.  Without it, he\'ll be nothing more 
than a figurehead.  End comment.

cabinets, Senior General Than Shwe continues the regime\'s 
patronage-based tradition of rewarding his supporters with 
wealth-generating positions and by retiring those who are no 
longer useful or may have questionable allegiances.  END 
SUMMARY.

3.  (C)  Burma will now have two Deputy Foreign Ministers. 
The current one, Deputy Foreign Minister U Khin Maung Win, 
will reportedly remain in his job and will still be the 
deputy leader of delegation to UNGA.  There is widespread 
speculation that Khin Maung Win could take over as Foreign 
Minister as the current FM, Win Aung, has been very open 
about his desire to retire to a Buddhist monastery.  The new 
additional Deputy Foreign Minister, U Kyaw Thu, may possibly 
be assigned responsibility for regional issues and building 
the regime\'s diplomatic defenses in preparation for this 
Fall\'s ASEAN meeting. 
COMMENT:  HOW DO YOU SPELL P-A-T-R-O-N-A-G-E? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) In this current round of assignments in one of the 
world\'s largest government cabinets, Senior General Than Shwe 
continues the regime\'s patronage-based tradition of rewarding 
his supporters with wealth-generating positions and by 
retiring those who are no longer useful or may have 
questionable allegiances.  The new Ministers and Deputy 
Ministers in the resources and business-related ministries 
can now begin to personally benefit from the 
institutionalized graft that make these positions so worth 
while.   For example, the new Mayor of Rangoon is in the best 
position for earning money, evidenced by former Rangoon Mayor 
and Than Shwe\'s golfing buddy U Ko Lay, who was allegedly 
able to earn over one million USD a year through kickbacks. 
Even the new Vice Mayor is in a lucrative position as he has 
authority to sign some contracts for the city.  End comment.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The Chinese Ambassador to Burma provided us 
on August 27 with an overview of the purpose and results of 
SPDC Vice Chairman General Maung Aye\'s recent \"routine\" China 
visit, China\'s negative view of U.S. sanctions and their 
implications for regime change, the rationale behind recent 
Chinese troop movements along the Burmese border, and the 
potential for additional Chinese economic aid to Burma. 
China, according to their Ambassador, will maintain its 
long-standing policy of non-interference in Burma\'s internal 
affairs, while actively engaging with the current regime to 
bring about economic growth and gradual political change. 
U.S. sanctions, he argued, are counterproductive and will 
lead to greater suspicion of ASSK by the military regime and 
diminish prospects for political change in Burma.  End 
Summary. 
 
General Maung Aye\'s China Visit:  Business as Usual 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (C) During an August 27 meeting with COM, Chinese 
Ambassador to Burma Li Jinjun offered that a top-level 
Burmese mission to China in late August had been planned for 
almost a full year, implying it was not a reaction to the 
events of May 30th.  Li acknowledged, however, that the 
participation of the regime\'s second in command, SPDC Vice 
Chairman General Maung Aye, had not been expected and only 
came about after the events of May 30.  Li added that the 
proximity of Maung Aye\'s visit to a realignment of the 
Burmese government following his return to Rangoon (refs A, 
B) was merely a \"coincidence.\" 
 
3. (C) Li described the Maung Aye trip as a \"normal and 
friendly\" bilateral visit, noting that similar exchanges, 
particularly military, are routine.  Li affirmed press 
reports that Maung Aye had met with leaders from China\'s 
Central Military Commission (CMC), as well as with President 
Hu Jintao and State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan, to discuss 
regional and bilateral issues.  Li demurred on the COM\'s 
request for more details and stated that China\'s Burma policy 
was consistent and continued to be based on China\'s \"five 
basic principles of coexistence and non-interference in the 
internal affairs of other countries,\" points he said both Hu 
Jintao and Tang Jiaxuan had emphasized during their meetings 
with Maung Aye. 
 
\"Sanctions Interfere...With Our Paychecks\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Li explained that China opposes U.S. sanctions on 
Burma and views the measures as interference in Burma\'s 
internal affairs.  Nonetheless, because the current situation 
in Burma has led to heightened international concern, China 
has urged the regime to take \"proper steps\" to keep the 
process of national reconciliation moving forward.  The key, 
said Li, is increasing the speed of economic development. 
Too much pressure on Burma, such as that being imposed by the 
U.S. and others, will be counterproductive and undermine 
chances for the speedy release of ASSK, he opined. 
 
5. (C) Li said that prior to the Maung Aye visit he had met 
with SPDC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe, who was 
\"emotional and angry\" over U.S. sanctions and international 
pressure placed on Burma.  Than Shwe complained to the 
Chinese Ambassador that the international community failed to 
recognize his contributions to Burma, alleging that foreign 
governments were engaged in efforts to get rid of him. 
Ambassador Li assessed that the Burmese generals believe the 
SPDC is being treated unfairly, and it is therefore difficult 
for them to take steps to release ASSK from detention. 
 
6. (C) Li observed that U.S. sanctions have hurt Chinese 
businesses in Burma, leaving them with a \"negative impression 
of the U.S.\" because the greatest impact is on foreign 
manufacturers and Burmese citizens, not the Burmese regime. 
COM responded that the violent May 30 attack had required a 
strong reaction from the U.S. and that sanctions were a 
message to the SPDC that the regime needs to make a credible 
move to return to the pre-May 30 era by releasing ASSK and 
others and beginning a meaningful political dialogue.  (Note: 
 At a follow-on lunch we hosted for the Chinese Embassy\'s 
political section, the Chinese political counselor expressed 
dismay over U.S. sanctions, and then emotionally complained 
that she and her colleagues are unable to receive their U.S. 
dollar-denominated salaries because wire transfers from their 
New York accounts have been blocked for over a month.) 
 
We Shall Engage 
--------------- 
 
7. (C) Li said that whether the current regime ultimately 
will accept a government led by ASSK depends on whether 
mutual mistrust can be reduced; ASSK cannot continue with her 
confrontations and expect the support of the Burmese Army 
should she become leader of the country.  Furthermore, 
current international pressure makes the military government 
even more mistrustful of ASSK\'s intentions.  The 
international community, including the U.S., EU, and ASEAN, 
must take immediate steps to reduce pressure on the regime, 
as positive change will only be possible in an environment 
where an inclusive, rather than an isolationist, approach is 
used.  Thus, China will maintain close contact with the 
current government.  Li indicated he had urged U.N. Special 
Envoy for Burma Razali Ismail to put pressure on the U.S. to 
adopt a similar approach. 
 
8. (C) Li said the recent appointment of former SPDC 
Secretary -1 General Khin Nyunt as the Prime Minister was not 
 
SIPDIS 
a surprise and would be helpful in improving Burma\'s 
international image.  This realignment suggests the military 
regime may be moving toward separation of political and 
military affairs, a move which should facilitate the 
resumption of the dialogue process.  Li said he viewed the 
appointment as a promotion and believes that Khin Nyunt\'s 
responsibilities should be further modified to include the 
SPDC\'s economic portfolio, but exclude his current role as 
chief military intelligence, in order to effect greater 
separation of powers between the military and civilian sides 
of the government. 
 
Unifying PLA Border Protection 
------------------------------ 
 
9. (C) COM inquired about reports of recent Chinese troop 
movements on the Sino-Burmese border.  Li acknowledged the 
reports were true, but said that the PLA movements were also 
a \"coincidence\", intimating they had nothing to do with Maung 
Aye\'s visit to Beijing, the SPDC realignment, or recent Thai 
threats against the ethnic Chinese United Wa State Army 
(UWSA) in Burma.  Li explained that the PLA has a national 
responsibility for maintaining China\'s land borders, but 
until recently Burma and the DPRK have been exceptions to 
this practice.  In January 2003, Li claimed he personally 
lobbied Luo Gan, who is in charge of border management, 
suggesting that unified management of China\'s borders under 
the PLA would be beneficial in combating illegal migration, 
drug trafficking, and prohibited mining and forest 
activities.  Li said that while Beijing had made the decision 
at the beginning of the year to replace police and 
immigration personnel on the Burmese border with regular PLA 
units, central authorities had just recently implemented the 
order. 
 
More Economic Aid? 
------------------ 
 
10. (C) Pol/Econ Chief inquired about the mid-August signing 
of a USD 200 million Chinese loan to Burma for the purpose of 
constructing a hydropower plant.  Li noted the timing of this 
event was another \"coincidence;\" the \"soft\" loan had been 
agreed to in January 2003 but the final signing, originally 
scheduled to take place in April or May, had to be postponed 
because of the SARS crisis in China and the May 30th 
\"incident\".  Li commented that the shortage of electricity in 
Burma is not only contributing to a stagnant economic 
development situation, but also is impacting negatively on 
the lives of the Burmese people.  Li did not respond whether 
China had plans at this time for additional loans or 
assistance, but intimated that bilateral aid would continue 
to be a primary policy tool in Burma. 
 
Comment: We\'ll Do It Our Way 
---------------------------- 
11. (C) Li is a polished diplomat who smoothly and without 
apology articulated his government\'s seemingly contradictory 
policies of non-interference in Burma and intense engagement 
with the SPDC.  While there are some areas of agreement 
between the U.S. and China on Burma, including the need for a 
quick resumption of dialogue and significant economic and 
political reform, Li gave every indication that China will 
continue to follow its own path and cannot be expected to 
support U.S. sanctions or added pressure on Burma\'s regime to 
release ASSK and resume a political dialogue.  To the 
contrary, Li suggested that China is looking for 
opportunities to provide the generals with support and succor 
in order to offset their increased isolation from the rest of 
the international community. This attitude indicates hopes 
that China would take an active role in urging meaningful 
change by the SPDC are misplaced, at least for now.  End

SUBJECT: PM KHIN NYUNT\'S SPEECH: THE BURMESE ROAD TO 
\"DISCIPLINED DEMOCRACY\" 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  On August 30 General Khin Nyunt delivered 
his first speech as Prime Minister (and perhaps the first 
such policy address from Burma\'s military regime in over ten 
years), promising a seven-step transition to a \"disciplined 
democracy.\"  However, his \"Road Map of Myanmar\" offers 
nothing that hasn\'t been promised before during the military 
regime\'s 15-year rule.  Absent any details--or even a basic 
timeline--the speech did nothing to convince observers in 
Burma that the SPDC has any intention of giving up power. 
Khin Nyunt\'s specific criticism of ASSK and the NLD gives us 
further evidence that the SPDC is determined to dismantle the 
pro-democracy movement.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) On Saturday August 30, SPDC General Khin Nyunt 
delivered a policy speech \"clarifying the future policies and 
programs of the State\" to a large cast of military and 
government officials, including members of the junta\'s 
governing council, cabinet ministers, regional military 
commanders, and representatives of state-sponsored 
organizations.  The 80 minute address, delivered Saturday 
morning at Rangoon\'s refurbished Parliament building, was his 
first policy pronouncement as Burma\'s new Prime Minister and 
was broadcast later in the day on official television.  The 
GOB did not invite the diplomatic corps, ethnic groups, or 
international NGOs to the speech. 
 
The SPDC Saviors 
---------------- 
 
3. (C) In his policy speech, a rarity for leaders of the 
Burmese regime, General Khin Nyunt extolled the virtues of 
the armed forces (\"Tatmadaw\") and delivered a stale defense 
of the 1988 military coup which brought the current regime to 
power.  Citing dubious economic data, and incongruous 
statistics such as \"128 PhD students produced in the last 
three years\" and \"1,012 miles of new railroads since 1989,\" 
Khin Nyunt devoted the first half of his speech to the SPDC\'s 
standard argument that the military alone is capable of 
leading Burma\'s diverse population and saving the country 
from falling into chaos. 
 
4. (C) Khin Nyunt used his address to direct pointed 
criticism at the National League for Democracy (NLD) and Aung 
San Suu Kyi (ASSK).  Alleging that the NLD had \"placed the 
attitude and wishes of an individual (ASSK) and the interests 
of its own party above the national cause,\" Khin Nyunt blamed 
the NLD for the collapse of the National Convention in 
1996--and, by inference, blocking a transition to 
democracy--and for convincing \"some big countries\" to 
unjustly pressure the SPDC.  He also accused the NLD of 
\"continuous political manipulations to bring down the present 
government,\" a thinly veiled accusation that ASSK had 
provoked the May 30 violent attack against her and her convoy 
of party members and supporters.  These negative references 
were the only specific mention in the speech of the 
democratic opposition. 
 
Road Map to a \"Disciplined Democratic System\" 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) In his speech, Khin Nyunt unveiled what he called a 
seven step \"Road Map of Myanmar.\"  Without offering details 
or specifying a timeline, the PM said the government would, 
step-by-step, reconvene the National Convention; implement a 
\"genuine and disciplined democratic system;\" draft a new 
constitution; adopt the constitution through a national 
referendum; hold parliamentary elections; convene a new 
Parliament; and form a new Parliamentary-based government. 
The reference to a \"disciplined democracy,\" and repeated 
references to the need for a home-grown democratic system, 
suggested that the SPDC anticipates the military will 
maintain supreme authority over any future government. 
 
Comment: Hopes Dashed 
--------------------- 
6. (C) Despite widespread mistrust of the military regime, 
many Burmese had some expectations that Khin Nyunt\'s speech, 
given his recent appointment as Prime Minister and the rarity 
of direct policy communications from the regime, might 
actually deliver some new, if not good, news.  On both 
accounts, the Burmese people were sorely disappointed.  Khin 
Nyunt\'s \"Road Map of Myanmar,\" while neatly packaged, is 
nothing more than a collection of empty promises proffered by 
the SLORC and SPDC at different junctures over the past 
fifteen years.  \"We\'ve heard all of this before\" has been a 
common refrain on the streets of Rangoon over the past two 
days. 
7. (C) General Khin Nyunt\'s speech also underscored the 
SPDC\'s apparent resolve to exclude ASSK and the NLD from the 
political process in Burma.  He specifically noted that the 
government would reconvene the National Convention \"that has 
been adjourned since 1996,\" which by definition describes the 
Convention after the NLD withdrew in protest.  Many observers 
here had also hoped that Khin Nyunt would announce a release 
of political prisoners, a Burmese tradition in speeches \"from 
the throne,\" and give some indication as to when the SPDC 
would free ASSK and her colleagues from \"protective custody.\" 
 Not only did the PM fail to deliver on these expectations, 
his personal criticism of ASSK and the NLD leads many to 
believe that the regime has every intention of completing the 
total dismantling of the NLD, a process that began with the 
May 30 attack and was followed by the shuttering of all NLD 
offices and a mass roundup of NLD leaders and members.  End 
comment.

1. (C) Reftel A conclusion that there is a discrepancy 
between MOFA Tokyo and the Japanese Embassy in Rangoon 
matches our assessment that Japanese Ambassador Miyamoto and 
his senior staff strongly oppose their headquarters on Burma 
policy.  As we noted in refs B and C, Miyamoto, and his 
political counselor, have made clear to us and others in 
Rangoon that they strongly advocate close and unconditional 
engagement with the Burmese regime, in contrast to Tokyo\'s 
evolving policy in the wake of the May 30 attack on, and 
subsequent detainment of, ASSK. 
 
2. (C) Japanese Ambassador Miyamoto recently told COM that he 
plans to personally lobby Diet Members for support in 
reversing the GOJ decision to suspend new assistance to 
Burma.  Miyamoto has made several semi-public comments on 
Japan\'s new aid policy, mostly recent at a meeting of the 
mini-Dublin Group on August 26, noting his less than 
favorable views on cutting assistance to Burma.  He notes 
wryly that although he has seen press reports on the new GOP 
policy, he has yet to receive official instructions from 
Tokyo (Note: Myamoto will return to Tokyo this week for 
consultations followed by several weeks of personal leave). 
 
3. (C) We do not see any evidence that Miyamoto plans to 
cease and desist his campaign to step up engagement with the 
SPDC.  Given upcoming meetings between MOFA Division Director 
Yamanouchi and EAP DAS Daley, and between the Japanese Deputy 
Foreign Minister and Deputy Secretary Armitage, we believe it 
essential for Department principals to be aware of the 
Japanese Embassy\'s efforts to reverse GOJ policy.  Japan\'s 
decision to suspend new assistance has weakened the 
confidence of the SPDC generals and presents a more unified 
front on the part of the international community.  Continued 
Japanese pressure is essential to helping our efforts to 
press the regime to release ASSK and begin a meaningful 
political dialogue.

SUBJECT: UNDP BURMA\'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT READOUT 
 
 
1. (U)  SUMMARY:  COM and PolOff attended the UNDP,s Annual 
Assessment Mission debriefing for the diplomatic corps on 
August 28 to hear observations of, and recommendations for, 
UNDP,s Burma operations.  The assessment team reported that 
UNDP,s Burma programs have all been properly designed to 
have the intended grassroots impact and are making a 
difference, but expressed concerns that programs will face a 
sustainability challenge in the future.  The team also noted 
there was not the rapid deterioration in rural area living 
conditions as was reported by the previous year\'s Assessment 
Mission.  The Assessment Mission\'s official report will be 
available after it is presented to the September UNDP 
Executive Board.   END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) Over a nine-day period in late August, a UNDP 
two-person Assessment Mission, Mr. Robert Shaw and Mr. Mirza 
Shafiquer Rahman, randomly sampled township and village-level 
UNDP programs in both the Irrawaddy delta region and in 
eastern Rakhine State.  The mission examined the UNDP,s 
Human Development Initiative ) Level 4 (HDI-4) projects, 
which entails Integrated Community-Based Development in 
2,3000 villages, Community-Based Development in 400 villages, 
micro credit in 1,700 villages, and HIV/AIDS programs. 
 
3. (U) Regarding the micro credit issue, the Assessment 
Mission noted that rural Burma suffers a huge demand for 
rural credit, especially following the 2003 banking crisis. 
UNOPS executes the program and uses the international NGOs 
\"PACT\" in central Burma and \"GRET\" in Shan Sate, and a 
subcontracted Indian company in the Delta region.  Village 
money lenders charge 125 percent interest on average, but are 
able to stay in business because the farmers no longer have 
access to government subsidized fertilizer and must borrow to 
buy commercial fertilizer.  Even at such high interest rates, 
there is still a market for money lending since farmers have 
limited or no access to credit. 
 
4. (U) According to UNDP briefers, the January 2003 UNDP 
executive board meeting had discussed the possibility of 
enabling micro credit programs in Burma to achieve 
sustainability by becoming a legal entity.  However, the 
board decided that it isn\'t appropriate for UNDP to work with 
the GOB on this, leaving current UNDP micro credit 
intervention programs as the only option.  The Assessment 
Mission noted during their debriefing that the micro credit 
program is not sustainable if UNDP can\'t institutionalize it 
by making it a legal entity in Burma.  Stressing that there 
is a huge demand from the rural areas for more credit, but 
when the UNDP funding ends, there will be no more program. 
 
5. (U) The Assessment Mission also mentioned what they saw as 
problem areas:  Ongoing UNDP program monitoring and 
evaluation can be improved, micro financing is 
undercapitalized, and the Burmese agricultural sector needs 
to be reviewed.  Shaw went on to identify what he termed 
strategic challenges: policy dialogue with the GOB, program 
sustainability, eventual institutionalization of programs, 
and future directions for UNDP in Burma. 
 
6. (U) UNDP Resident Representative Charles Petrie, who 
arrived in Burma to take up duties in July, closed the 
debriefing by saying that he is undertaking a few changes to 
improve the UNDP programs in Burma, including more fully 
using the Analysis and Planning Unit, focusing on replicating 
programs in neighboring townships and villages, and promoting 
partnership between the UN agencies and international NGOs in 
Burma, which UNDP will push with a November Community Based 
Initiative workshop for international NGOs.  He has also 
directed his staff to conduct a living conditions survey as 
well as an agricultural survey that the Assessment Mission 
had recommended. 
 
7. (SBU) The Assessment Mission leader concluded that there 
was not a rapid deterioration in rural area living conditions 
as had been reported by last year\'s Assessment Mission. 
UNDP Burma\'s senior staff confided to PolOff that last year, 
the Assessment Mission had focused on a township in the 
Irrawaddy delta ) where the townships villages had been hit 
by serious floods, followed by pestilence, and forced labor 
levies from the local battalion commander during the harvest 
season.   The triple punch was disastrous for the villagers 
and thus skewed that Assessment Mission\'s country-wide 
conclusions. 
 
8. (U) According to the Assessment Mission, their conclusions 
will be available on the UNDP web site in November or 
December and will be represented at the next UNDP Board 
meeting in the middle of September.

1.  (C) SUMMARY: On Sunday, September 7, SPDC Chairman Than 
Shwe made new appointments to the five top jobs in the 
National Convention Convening Commission, the first step in 
implementing the Burma\'s \"roadmap\" to democracy. 
Significantly, for the first time a member of the ruling 
military junta, SPDC Secretary-2 Lt Gen Thein Sein, has been 
appointed to the committee and will serve as the Chairman. 
Taken along with a recent SPDC and cabinet realignment over 
the previous two weeks, this newest change is strong evidence 
the Junta is pushing ahead with it\'s pre-set battle plan to 
march down the \"Burmese Road To Democracy,\" with the ultimate 
objective of appearing in the eyes of the region, if not the 
international community, to have a more visually acceptable 
form of government.   Details of the new appointments are 
provided in paragraph 2.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ANNOUNCED APPOINTMENTS 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (U) SPDC Chairman and Senior General Than Shwe announced 
on September 7 new leadership appointments for the National 
Convention Convening Commission, the 18-member body that is 
responsible for convening the constitutional convention and 
creating committees to draft the new constitution.  The 
following are the new Commission leaders, with embassy 
biographical data in parenthesis: 
 
(a) SPDC Secretary 2 Lt Gen Thein Sein, Chairman (Armed 
Forces Adjutant General, 
Former Commander of Golden Triangle Region, Head of Myanmar 
Economic Corporation, 
USDA Patron, War Veterans Organization (WVO) Organizing 
Committee Chairman) 
 
(b) Chief Justice U Aung Toe, Vice-Chairman; (Chief Justice 
since 1988, responsible for 
writing the finished 1995 constitution draft, was briefly 
Chairman in 1996) 
 
(c) Minister of Electric Power Maj Gen Tin Htut, 
Vice-Chairman; (Formerly Commander of Eastern 
Command HQ, USDA Executive, WVO member) 
 
(d) Ministry of Information Brig Gen Kyaw Hsan, Secretary; 
and (Former Dep Commander of N.W. 
Command, Deputy Min of Commerce, USDA Executive and Campaign 
Manager, WVO member) 
 
(e) Director of Directorate of Public Relations and 
Psychological 
Warfare Maj Gen Khin Aung Myint, Joint-Secretary  (Previously 
Commandant of Min of 
Defense Compound, Dep Minister for Military affairs) 
 
STEP #1 On the Burmese Road to Democracy 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) This is the first time the SPDC has assigned an SPDC 
member to the Commission.  It is also the first time they 
have assigned senior USDA members.  With the SPDC\'s new S-2 
as Chairman, combined with the continuing presence of Maj Gen 
Kyaw Win, Deputy Chief of OCMI, and Brig Gen Than Tun, Head 
of Office for OCMI, there is now plenty of muscle on the 
commission to accomplish it\'s mission.   Step One on the 
recently-announced Burmese Road Map for Democracy is to 
convene the Constitutional Convention, and it appears that Sr 
Gen Than Shwe has just given marching orders to the new 
Commission Chairman to do exactly that -- convene the 
constitutional convention. 
 
OPTIONS FOR THE NEW CHAIRMAN 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) If the new Commission Chairman does reconvene the 
convention, he will have three options to chose from.  The 
committee can either reassemble the original NLD-dominated 
1993 convention, reconvene the NLD-boycotted 1996 convention, 
or \"pack the court\" and convene a new body of pliable 
delegates appointed by the government and encompassing as 
many ethnic groups as convenient.  The committee will not 
likely go with option one above, since it means involving the 
NLD.  Option two is more likely as it doesn\'t involve the 
NLD, and provides the appearance of being fair to 
non-discriminating observers.  Option three is likely if 
option two becomes too difficult, but will give the least 
appearance of legitimacy as it blatantly disenfranchises 
those who want to participate in a genuine democratic process. 
 
ETHNIC ROAD BLOCKS AHEAD? 
------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The first real roadblock on the \"Burmese Road to 
Democracy\" may come from the ethnic groups.  The second 
largest opposition party in Burma, the Shan National League 
for Democracy (SNLD), stated this weekend it would boycott 
any convention that did not allow the free discussions of 
opinions and ideas -- which was the reason the NLD walked out 
of the 1993 convention in the first place. The Wa are also 
reportedly leery of participating in a reconvened 1996 
convention.  How the SPDC will clear these possible 
roadblocks will determine early on the legitimacy of this 
entire process. 
 
STILL MOVING FORWARD 
-------------------- 
 
6.  COMMENT:  The generals have decided to re-package 
themselves as a sop to their neighbors in the region, and 
they will likely do it with a military-style approach that 
dictates actions to be taken in a set sequence -- as 
evidenced in the last three weeks worth of changes.  However, 
their plan may have difficulty accounting for the unexpected. 
 The very strong international response to reports of ASSK\'s 
hunger strike caught the SPDC flat footed and angered them 
into hurling charges against the U.S. of trying to upstage 
the Prime Minister\'s new road map.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BURMA: UNODC MAKES A PITCH FOR KOKANG/WA 
INTERVENTION (KOWI) 
 
REF: RANGOON 707 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  The UNODC has been making a quiet pitch 
for support among donors for a new counternarcotics 
intervention in the Wa and Kokang areas of Burma\'s Shan State 
(dubbed the \"KOWI\" project).  UNODC Burma resident 
representative Jean-Luc Lemahieu recently conducted a round 
of bilateral consultations within the diplomatic corps and 
gave a more detailed description of the proposed KOWI 
intervention at an August 26 mini-Dublin Group meeting.  He 
also shared more details from the 2002-2003 UNODC opium 
survey, which concluded that overall opium cultivation is 
sharply down in Burma, but revealed disturbing signs that the 
Wa are increasing opium activity in advance of their 2005 
deadline to cease cultivation.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) In a private meeting with COM and P/E chief, Lemahieu 
reported that UNODC\'s Wa project had been extended for two 
years, primarily to enhance the project\'s community 
development component, and he was hopeful that USG funding 
would return to previous levels (which he indicated was USD 
700,000).  Lemahieu suggested that the USG had decreased Wa 
funding in favor of increased support for counternarcotics 
activities in Afghanistan.  In response to COM\'s inquiry 
about a standing Wa commitment to cease opium cultivation by 
2005, Lemahieu said that reports the Wa had postponed their 
target date by two years were false and the GOB\'s drug czar, 
General Kyaw Thein, had personally confirmed that the Wa are 
keeping to their promised schedule.  However, Lemahieu 
acknowledged that there is intense pressure within the Wa 
population to increase opium cultivation, explaining that 
farmers are unconvinced that there will be sufficient 
resources to offset future losses of income. 
 
UNODC 2002/2003 Opium Survey 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) At an August 26 mini-Dublin Group meeting, chaired 
by the Japanese Ambassador, Lemahieu said that UNODC\'s 
2002/2003 crop survey had determined that Burma experienced a 
24 percent decrease in overall opium cultivation.  However, 
there had been a marginal increase in production due to 
improved weather conditions.  In specific regions, the Kokang 
areas of northeastern Shan State experienced a 50 percent 
decrease in cultivation (which Lemahieu described as too 
fast, not allowing the GOB enough time to consolidate gains), 
while Wa areas saw a 20 percent increase.  Queried by 
mini-Dublin Group participants about the disturbing Wa 
increases, Lemahieu explained that the Wa were likely taking 
advantage of an \"open window\" for short-term profit before 
the 2005 moratorium on production.  In fact, he added, the 
yield in parts of the Wa territory was above 13 kg per 
hectare, approaching Afghanistan yield levels, which implies 
the use of outside technical assistance, irrigation, and 
fertilizer--inputs heretofore not a part of the Burma opium 
industry. 
 
4. (SBU) UNODC\'s Lemahieu appealed for donor pledges for the 
next opium survey, noting that their was a need to support 
salaries for counterpart units and a desire to extend the 
survey into Kachin and Rahkine States.  He observed that the 
political situation in Burma (i.e. the aftermath of the May 
30 attack on Aung San Suu Kyi) had caused some donors to back 
off of previous pledge commitments. 
 
Donor Issues 
------------ 
 
5. (SBU) At the 8/26 mini-Dublin meeting, Lemahieu described 
the USG as a \"traditional pillar of support\" for UNODC, and 
added that solid funding was also in the pipeline from 
Germany (USD one million) and Italy (USD 100,000) for the 
existing Wa project and from Australia for other Shan State 
projects.  Australia also reported that it now has both a 
permanent police advisor and a technical assistant attached 
to the Narcotics Task Force in Mandalay.  The Japanese 
delegation said that they would provide USD 500,000 for the 
Kokang project, but noted a Tokyo decision to cease new 
development funding in Burma as a result of the May 30 
attack.  Last year, Japan contributed USD 1.2 million under 
the Human Security Fund to construct a canal in the Wa 
region.  COM reported to participants that President\'s 
certification decision would be announced in mid-September 
and that a new DEA representative had recently arrived in 
Burma. 
 
KOWI: Kokang/Wa Intervention 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) According to UNODC, a joint assessment conducted 
with Japanese and NGO participation in March and April 
revealed the urgent need to counter the growth of cultivated 
land in northern Wa territory and a worsening humanitarian 
situation in Kokang areas.  The result is a Kokang and Wa 
Intervention (KOWI) proposal, a five year, USD 12.85 million 
project comprised of 20-plus varied components.  Japan, which 
is apparently prepared to commit USD 500,000 for emergency 
assistance to the Kokang, has identified four priority KOWI 
components: food security, rural development, agricultural 
development, and a development of a \"comprehensive strategy.\" 
 The World Food Program (WFP), which also participated in the 
joint assessment, pledged an immediate contribution of USD 
200,000 for immediate food security needs, and several NGOs 
will collaborate in food for work programs. 
 
6. (C) Lemahieu noted that the GOB was not initially very 
receptive to an international presence in the Kokang area, 
but reluctantly agreed to two field missions and the WFP 
immediate response project.  With regard to advancing the 
proposed KOWI intervention, Lemahieu said that UNODC wanted 
to get a full commitment for funding from donors before 
devoting substantial UNODC resources to planning and 
undertaking initial steps. 
 
Expanding the Mini-Dublin Group? 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) At the August 26 mini-Dublin Group meeting, several 
participants suggested that the next meeting should include 
representatives from neighboring countries affected by trade 
in narcotics and precursor drugs.  UNODC reported that China 
in particular has expressed a keen interest in discussing 
drug cooperation efforts.  This appears to be an outcome of 
the August 2001 Beijing Declaration on regional law 
enforcement cooperation between Burma, Thailand, Laos, and 
China.  As a result, UNODC proposed, and participants agreed, 
to invite China, Thailand, and India to the next mini-Dublin 
Group meeting.

BETWEEN ENGAGEMENT AND DEMOCRACY SUPPORT 
 
REF: BEIJING 12297 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  During a September 10 meeting with COM, 
Indian Ambassador to Burma Rajiv Kumar Bhatia described 
India\'s Burma policy as having two pillars:  engagement with 
the regime and support for democracy.  India will continue to 
move forward on both fronts simultaneously, he said, striking 
what it considers to be an appropriate balance between the 
two objectives based on India\'s strategic interests.  Bhatia 
expressed concern about a recent public statement by 
Indonesian Foreign Minister Wirajuda urging the SPDC to 
release Aung San Suu Kyi prior to the upcoming ASEAN Summit 
in Bali, remarking that it would only incite a nationalistic 
and contrary response from the regime.  Further high-level 
statements certainly would derail prospects for her immediate 
release, he said.  Bhatia views the appointment of General 
Khin Nyunt as Prime Minister and moves to reconvene the 
National Convention as positive, stressing that we should not 
mechanically assume these actions are \"more of the same\" but 
rather interpret them as possible indicators of greater 
flexibility by the SPDC and the start of a phased succession. 
 End summary. 
 
A Two-Pillar Policy 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) The two pillars that form the basis of India\'s Burma 
policy are engagement with the regime and support for 
democracy, said Bhatia.  India continues to show its 
sensitivity to democratic sentiments by pushing privately at 
the highest levels of the Burmese government for the 
immediate release of ASSK, dialogue with the NLD, and 
transition to democracy.  Bhatia pointedly noted, however, 
that what constituted an appropriate balance between the two 
pillars had to be decided by India according to its strategic 
interests.  Noting that recent high-level Indian civilian and 
military visits to Burma had been in the pipeline for 1-2 
years, Bhatia rhetorically questioned whether they should 
have been postponed after the 30 May incident and answered 
\"no,\" as one pillar of India\'s policy is engagement, 
afterall.  In fact, he said U.S. strategic interests 
vis--vis Burma, including HIV/AIDS, terrorism, and narcotics 
trafficking demand continuous engagement with Burma, not 
alienation.  Bhatia described Burma as a country looking for 
a model, commenting that any path to democracy must be 
adapted to local circumstances and that India is looking for 
signs that Burma is committed to its own path, rather than 
one imposed from outside. 
 
Remarks by Indonesian Foreign Minister \"ill-timed\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3. (C) Bhatia characterized the recent statement by 
Indonesian Foreign Minister Wirajuda on the need to release 
ASSK prior to the upcoming ASEAN Summit in Bali as \"not 
especially helpful,\" arguing that it would incite a 
nationalistic response from the Burmese government at odds 
with the objective of securing ASSK\'s immediate release. 
Bhatia later commented that the statement \"unnerved\" him and 
assessed that any further similar statements by other 
governments, what he labeled \"high-level chatter,\" would 
derail any prospect for a good outcome on this issue.  In 
response, COM remarked that continued international pressure 
was both necessary and effective, noting the regime has taken 
concrete action in response to international pressure and 
that during periods of no such pressure, there was no 
movement at all.  Bhatia agreed that pressure on the regime 
does result in a response, but that it must be calibrated 
properly, implying both the statement by Foreign Minister 
Wirajuda and recent U.S. actions had not been (read: 
sanctions and attention drawn to ASSK\'s hunger strike). 
 
The National Convention 
----------------------- 
4. (C) With regard to the seven-point roadmap outlined by 
Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt on August 30 and recent 
announcements on reconvening the National Convention, Bhatia 
said that if the National Convention really is reconvening, 
the matter should be straightforward.  However, there was no 
real continuity in the make-up of the Convening Commission 
and he was hearing a hard-line view from his contacts on the 
question of whether or not the NLD would be allowed to 
participate.  Nonetheless, Bhatia believed the regime was 
making an attempt to get the NLD back into the process and 
that in contrast to the situation 10 years ago, the 
possibility for flexibility on the part of the SPDC existed. 
\"We should not mechanically assume it will only be more of 
the same,\" he exhorted.  In Bhatia\'s assessment, the recent 
changes are not purely cosmetic and should be viewed with 
limited optimism, although not interpreted as a signal that 
democracy is on the way.  Bhatia also offered that Khin Nyunt 
has shown tremendous resilience, moving from the \"umbrella 
boy\" of former dictator Ne Win to a \"linchpin\" in the SPDC. 
 
Engagement \"Pillar\" appreciated by MOFA 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) During an introductory courtesy call on 15 August, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Director responsible for 
South Asia U Ye Mying told Pol/Econoffs that India and Burma 
have a \"fine tradition of friendship\" and that close 
relations with its neighbors are the priority for Burma.  Ye 
Mying also noted that in addition to high-level bilateral 
visits, sectoral exchanges were increasingly 
institutionalized and of benefit to both sides.  In separate 
conversations with other Indian Embassy officials in 
late-August and early September, Pol/Econoffs were told that 
Burma attaches greater importance to the relationship with 
India than does India, as trade with Burma is only a small 
part of overall Indian trade and that while bilateral 
mechanisms for cooperation have had some successes, they 
generally have provided forums for discussion and building 
trust rather than resolving key issues. 
 
Comment: No Desire to Tip the Boat 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) While the Indian Ambassador remarked several times 
during the 10 September exchange that India remains focused 
on the immediate release of ASSK and other political 
prisoners as well as the quick resumption of dialogue on 
transition to democracy, he made it clear that India will 
continue to engage actively with the current government.  A 
spate of recent high-level civilian and military visits 
reinforces this message and suggests that like China, India 
does not intend to back away from the current regime and 
views as counterproductive what it considers to be increased 
international pressure and attempts to isolate the regime. 
Our interlocutors at the Indian Embassy tell us that the 
insurgency issue on the Indo-Burmese border is the most 
difficult bilateral issue now confronting the two countries, 
and India does not want to take any action on Burma\'s 
domestic political situation that could derail progress on 
this border problem.  While India\'s two pillar approach may 
serve U.S. interests in terms of providing a counterbalance 
to China\'s increasing influence in Burma, we recommend that 
we enter into a dialogue on Burma with New Delhi that 
parallels our dialogue with Beijing (reftel).  End comment.

REF: RANGOON 994 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Following the recent application of new U.S. 
trade and financial sanctions on Burma, the GOB has faced 
considerable difficulty in utilizing U.S. dollars for 
official foreign trade transactions.  Third country 
entrepreneurs are unable, or unwilling, to issue letters of 
credit in U.S. dollars, forcing many Burma-based businessmen 
to resort to elaborate barter exchange and informal 
remittances.   GOB authorities, who remain defiant as the 
dollarized Burmese economy continues to absorb the blow of 
sanctions, recently issued an official directive ordering 
banks and entrepreneurs to switch from U.S. dollars to Euros, 
Japanese Yen, or Singapore dollars for new and existing L/Cs 
and export/import licenses.  The business community is highly 
skeptical, weary of income loss due to currency exchange 
requirements, and there are few signs that the new policy is 
catching on.  End Summary 
 
2.  (SBU) Following President Bush\'s signing of the Burma 
Freedom and Democracy Act in July, Burma\'s principal trade 
finance institutions, the Myanma Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) 
and the Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank (MICB), 
experienced an almost complete blockage of U.S. dollar 
transactions.  U.S. sanctions prohibit financial services to 
Burma, which had a broad and direct impact on Burma\'s 
dollar-based foreign trade when trade transactions could no 
longer be cleared through the U.S.   Many foreign-based 
financial institutions refused to conduct U.S. dollar 
transactions with companies in Burma and denied letters of 
credit in U.S. dollars.  Among those shutting down 
transactions were many Singapore banks, who play an important 
role in Burma\'s trade and overall economy. 
 
3.  (C) As a result of the immediate trade crisis, Lt. 
General Min Thein, then Minister of the Office of the 
Chairman of the SPDC, chaired a meeting in mid-August with 
entrepreneurs to discuss the sanctions (reftel).  Although no 
clear policy pronouncements emerged from this session, 
ministers in attendance subsequently collaborated to develop 
a plan to direct foreign trade away from the U.S. dollar 
toward several \"alternative\" currencies.  We learned in early 
September that the Ministry of Commerce had issued an 
official directive on August 12, directing banks and 
entrepreneurs to amend values of goods in existing U.S. 
dollar export and import licenses, and all future licenses, 
in Euro, Japanese Yen, or Singapore dollars \"for opening L/Cs 
and for payments.\" (Note: the GOB made no public announcement 
regarding this directive.  End note). 
 
4. (C) Comment: Businessmen in Burma, already fatigued by 
corrupt practices of the regime and frustrated by the GOB\'s 
reluctance to deal effectively with the sanctions, have no 
faith that the plan to de-dollarize the economy will succeed. 
 Traders are already complaining that the new directive will 
cause significant currency exchange losses and they predict 
that overall official trade will decline sharply by the end 
of 2003.  Ironically, Lt. General Min Thein, who was behind 
the plan to switch to Euro/Yen/Singapore dollar trade, was 
ousted from the cabinet in an SPDC cabinet shuffle on August 
25.  End comment.

1. (C) SUMMARY: Post has received information that Rangoon 
police arrested seven university students on July 14 for 
attempting to reopen the Rangoon University Student Union and 
are holding them in Insein prison   The Junta\'s repressive 
actions at the smallest signs of student political activity 
indicates its continued fear of organized dissent on campuses 
and its continued willingness to use strong tactics to 
instill fear in other students.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  On September 13 Pol Off learned from a reliable 
source that the Burmese police had arrested seven 
Rangoon-area university students on July 14 for trying to 
reopen the Rangoon University Student Union, which had been 
de-registerd and dynamited by former dictator General Ne Win 
in July, 1962.  The students were held incommunicado until 
September 12 when the Special Branch of the Police 
Intelligence Wing notified the parents of the arrested 
students of their pending prosecutions.  The students remain 
in Rangoon\'s Insein prison, waiting for their trials to start. 
 
3.  (C)  The GOB plans to prosecute the students under 
Section Five of the Emergency Provisions Act of 1950, which 
prohibits spreading false news or undermining the Union. 
They are also being charged under the Press and Publication 
Acts which prohibit circulating uncensored documents, and the 
Organization Acts which prohibit the reforming of a banned 
organization.  Their trials are expected to begin within a 
week, will likely be short and result in guilty verdicts with 
immediate sentencing of 7-20 years.  The arrested student\'s

DG told us on September 18 that the specific dates for the 
visit are \"under negotiation,\" due primarily to the imminent 
departure of several GOB cabinet members to New York for the 
UNGA, but added that the visit would take place \"within

that they have heard Alatas will arrive as early as September

Alatas would visit Burma only in his capacity as a personal 
envoy for President Megawati, and not on behalf of ASEAN. 
 
2. (C) Comment:  A visit by Alatas to Rangoon, just two weeks 
prior to the ASEAN Summit in Bali, provides an excellent 
opportunity for a key ASEAN country to press the SPDC regime 
to release Aung San Suu Kyi and her detained NLD colleagues. 
The SPDC will make every attempt to use his visit, and the 
expected September 30 visit of U.N. Special Envoy Razali (ref 
C), to soften the frosty reception that Burma will face in 
Bali.  Furthermore, it is likely that the SPDC will chastise 
Alatas for FM Wirajuda\'s recent public call for ASSK\'s 
release (ref A).  We hope that Alatas is prepared to bite 
back and deliver a strong message that there will be no 
political progress until the NLD leadership is released from 
detention.

OPERATIONS 
 
REF: RANGOON 846 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The Burmese government seems poised to allow 
private banks to resume operations if they meet seven 
financial conditions.  The government has severely limited 
private banking operations since a run and subsequent crash 
in February.  Even without the authorities\' blessing, many 
smaller private banks have already re-opened for business. 
Sadly, we don\'t see the government\'s \"resolution\" of this 
eight-month-old crisis including the reforms necessary to 
rebuild a discredited, eviscerated private banking system. 
End summary. 
 
Rule of Sevens 
 
2. (C) According to banking sources, the GOB has made a 
decision to \"resolve\" the banking crisis in October.  Though 
nothing has been released formally, apparently the Finance 
Ministry has informed private bankers via the Bank Management 
Committee -- the committee formed to ride herd on disgraced 
private bankers following the private banking system\'s 
collapse in February. 
 
3. (C) Details are still sketchy, but according to the 
\"resolution\" plan, as of October 1 private banks will be 
expected to meet seven conditions.  Banks that do not meet 
all seven will not be allowed to re-open, though there is no 
mention of how the government intends to dispose of these 
delinquents. 
 
-- (1) Deposits cannot exceed seven times paid-in capital. 
-- (2) Total loans can be no more than 70 percent of total 
deposits. 
-- (3) As announced in June, all \"call deposit\" accounts 
(popular \"hot money\" accounts that offered an annual 4-10 
percent interest rate, compounded daily, with no restrictions 
on withdrawals) must be closed. 
-- (4) All Central Bank of Myanmar credit lines must be 
repaid.  According to one banker, most of the banks, which 
took only minimal credit when the crisis broke, have paid off 
their debt.  However, banks with larger outstanding debt -- 
such as Asia Wealth Bank (the country\'s largest), which 
borrowed 15 billion kyat (about $15 million) -- are in more 
difficult straits. 
-- (5) All Central Bank loans made against banks\' government 
bonds must be repaid. 
-- (6) Only government bonds will be considered as paid-in 
capital.  Currently government bonds pay 8.5 percent for 3 
years or 9 percent for 5 years while inflation is running 
30-40 percent thus far in 2003. 
-- (7) Private banks must bring all their accounts into line 
with pre-existing, but largely ignored, bank management 
requirements.  These include IMF-recommended 5-10 percent 
reserve requirement (depending on the type of deposit), 20 
percent liquidity requirement, and 10 percent capital 
adequacy ratio. 
 
4. (C) At this time, banking sector pundits are predicting 
that among the largest (by deposits) pre-crash banks, KBZ 
Bank (run by a close associate of Vice Senior General Maung 
Aye), Myanmar Mayflower Bank (capitalized largely by ethnic 
Wa businessmen), and Myanmar Overseas Bank will clear the 
hurdle -- or be allowed over the hurdle for political 
reasons.  Asia Wealth Bank and Yoma Bank, by far the two 
largest banks, and the two banks accused of the worst banking 
practices, are not expected to make the cut and will 
supposedly be reassessed at year\'s end. 
 
Throw Back the Little Ones 
 
5. (C) On a positive note, officials from some of the 
fourteen smaller private banks tell us that most of their 
institutions have already passed the seven tests, and have 
not been stopped from resuming normal operations -- though 
they have not received official clearance to do so.  However, 
this will do little to assist the economy or return money to 
the private banking system.  These banks have very small 
capital bases and loan portfolios, few depositors, few 
branches, and are generally in place to serve niche markets. 
Also, bankers concur with our assumption that most average 
Burmese will eschew the private banks, large and small, for 
years to come regardless of the government\'s certifications. 
 
Haven\'t We Learned Anything? 
 
6. (C) We had hoped that the government would learn some 
lessons from this eight-month-old crisis and address 
fundamental flaws that helped spark and fuel the debacle. 
The needs were clear: punish rogue bankers, rebuild consumer 
confidence, create an independent Central Bank and task it to 
improve oversight of lending practices, apply and enforce 
reasonable financial standards, and relax some of the 
burdensome regulations -- such as capping deposit and lending 
rates well below inflation -- that encouraged cowboy banking 
in order to turn a profit.  Though some of the GOB\'s new 
conditions are sound, none of these crucial issues was 
adequately addressed.  The GOB has kept its onerous pre-crash 
policies intact and imposed broad new standards.  Adding a 
low deposit ceiling and lending limitations to interest rate 
caps will make turning a profit nearly impossible.  The 
government has also made no specific commitment to 
independent oversight of lending -- other than threats of 
more frequent visits by military intelligence to suspect 
borrowers. 
 
7. (C) Certainly some businesspeople will bring their 
deposits and other business back to private banks when and if 
they emerge \"rehabilitated.\"  However, it is unclear how the 
government expects private banks to win back the majority of 
their suspicious customers and otherwise operate in this new, 
more restrictive environment.  Perhaps it does not.  There 
have long been rumors that the GOB\'s top leadership disliked 
the private banks because they were \"disruptive forces\" and 
controlled significant cash reserves.  True or not, in this 
atmosphere we don\'t see the private banking sector being able 
to return even to its relatively small pre-crash role in the 
Burmese economy.

1. (SBU)  On September 19, Aung San Suu Kyi\'s surgeon told 
several diplomats and assembled reporters that ASSK had 
undergone a \"major\" three hour surgery from noon to 3:00 p.m. 
 The surgeon, Dr. Tin Myo Win, who is also ASSK\'s personal 
physician, declined to discuss the reason for the operation, 
but said the surgical team had consisted of himself, two 
anesthesiologists, and one gynecologist.  Dr. Tin Myo Win 
reported that the surgery was \"100 percent successful\" and 
that no blood transfusion was required.  ASSK remains 
hospitalized, and under military guard, at the Asia Royal 
Cardiac Hospital in downtown Rangoon where the operation took 
place. 
 
2. (C) According to Embassy sources, ASSK was admitted to the 
hospital late on September 17 (reftel) and surgery was 
originally scheduled for September 18, but was then postponed 
for one day.  We made several visits to the hospital on 
September 19 and requested an opportunity to see ASSK and 
deliver flowers.  Hospital authorities initially denied ASSK 
was a patient, but eventually acknowledged her presence and 
accepted the flowers, but refused to allow a personal visit. 
Military intelligence officers have sealed off two floors at 
the hospital, including the top floor (9th) where ASSK is 
reportedly recuperating.  Several dozen NLD supporters were 
at the hospital today, quietly seeking information, but there 
was no other democratic opposition activity observed in 
Rangoon. 
 
3. (C) Comment: We understand that ASSK\'s doctor is under 
strict orders not to reveal specific information about her 
condition, or to comment on how long her stay at the hospital 
will last.  This surgery was clearly more than a \"routine 
outpatient procedure,\" as we had heard yesterday.  Sources 
tell us the operation was for a gynecological procedure, and 
we are also aware that ASSK suffers from a serious stomach 
ulcer.

1. (C) Summary: According to Aung San Suu Kyi\'s personal 
physician, the detained leader is \"doing extremely well\" 
after three days of post-operative recovery, although he 
expects her to remain in the hospital for at least another 
seven days.  He has cleared her medically to receive 
visitors, and believes that Indonesian Special Envoy Alatas 
will see her this week.  Although SPDC military intelligence 
personnel exert full control over the doctor\'s meetings with 
diplomats, and will not allow us to see ASSK, his reports are 
credible that she is receiving good care.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) P/E chief met on September 20 and again on September 
22 with ASSK\'s personal physician, Dr. Tin Myo Win, for 
updates on her recovery from gynecological surgery on 
September 19.  SPDC military intelligence (MI) arranged and 
supervised our meetings with the doctor, which also included 
diplomats from the British Embassy, at the Asia Royal Cardiac 
Hospital.  Dr. Tin Myo Win reported that ASSK was making a 
\"remarkable\" recovery from her operation, and on September 21 
was already able to eat solid foods provided by friends and 
supporters.  On September 22, her third day of post-operative 
recovery, ASSK was able to stand and walk around her 9th 
floor room, which her physician says has a view of the 
Shwedegon Pagoda, Rangoon\'s most prominent and revered 
landmark.  Dr. Tin Myo Won said that ASSK would remain at the 
hospital and under his care for at least another week until 
her stitches are removed and she has recovered from what he 
described as \"quickly scheduled, semi-emergency surgery.\" 
 
3. (C) At our meeting on September 20, Dr. Tin Myo Win said 
that ASSK was aware he would be briefing U.S. and British 
diplomats and she asked him to deliver a brief message that 
read: \"In accordance with her own decision, ASSK will take 
care of her own expenses, but I must add the authorities have 
been most helpful.\"   The physician told us that Embassy 
gifts of flowers and baked goods, as well as a message from 
her London-based son Alexander via the British Embassy, had 
been delivered to ASSK (after being photographed by MI 
officers).  However, according to the physician, MI handlers 
blocked delivery of our package that included recent 
newspapers and magazines.  Large crowds of up to 200 NLD 
supporters gathered at the hospital on Saturday and Sunday 
seeking information on ASSK\'s condition and Dr. Tin Myo Win 
said that they were deeply concerned over rumors that ASSK 
had cancer, but that after preliminary tests he was \"99 
percent certain\" that tissue removed during the operation was 
non-malignant. 
 
4. (C) Dr. Tin Myo Win said that as a result of ASSK\'s speedy 
recovery, he had medically cleared her to receive visitors as 
of Monday September 22.  He said that MI would not allow 
diplomats to see her, but would possibly accept a visit from 
one local relative or supporter.  In response to our inquiry, 
the physician said he believed ASSK would also be allowed to 
receive Indonesian Special Envoy Ali Alatas, who arrived in 
Rangoon on September 21. 
 
5. (C) Summary:  Dr. Tin Myo Win has provided us with the 
only available independent verification that ASSK is 
recovering successfully from her surgery.  We have no reason 
to doubt his reports.  That said, we have only been able to 
meet with him in recent days under the watchful eye of 
military intelligence operatives who, per their usual 
treatment of Western diplomats in Burma, videotaped and 
photographed our encounters with the doctor in an automotive 
repair shop across the street from the hospital.  Despite the 
secrecy surrounding her surgery and her continued detention, 
however, the SPDC has, by all appearances, allowed ASSK to 
obtain proper medical care.  The Rangoon rumor mill now has 
it that the regime has no choice but to transfer her to house 
arrest for longer term rest and recuperation, and not return 
her to detention at a Rangoon military compound.  On this 
political issue, however, her doctor will not speculate.  End 
Summary.

SUBJECT: BURMA: REGIME STEPS UP MILITIA TRAINING 
 
REF: RANGOON 1025 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The SPDC is moving forward with its 
country-wide militia training program, particularly in the 
capital city of Rangoon (reftel).  In early September, 
ward-level Peace and Development Council bosses in Rangoon 
began the process of ordering individual families to provide 
one person and 5,000 kyat (5 USD) for a 45-day training 
session.  The SPDC is using this stepped-up militia training 
partly as a psy-ops campaign to keep the population off 
balance and focused toward an unidentified \"external threat,\" 
and partly to develop an auxiliary force of the riot police 
and regular military.  Either way, militia service is an 
additional, and unwelcome, burden on an already beleaguered 
population.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) Since the beginning of September, ward-level SPDC 
councils throughout Rangoon have circulated letters to all 
families notifying them that they are ordered to provide one 
person from the family between 18 to 60 years of age to 
attend compulsory 45-day militia training.  Each person 
enrolling must pay 5,000 kyat (roughly 5 USD) for uniforms 
and equipment, which is around two week\'s salary for an 
average laborer in Rangoon.  Families not able to send a 
delegate are required to pay 1,500 kyat a day for 45 days, 
with 500 kyat going to a \"volunteer\" who takes their place, 
and 1,000 kyat going to the local SPDC fund.  This scheme 
should also allow wealthier families to buy their way out of 
the requirement, while at the same time padding SPDC coffers. 
 Less-wealthy families are tending to send an older, near 
retirement-age person to the training in order not to lose 
the income of younger wage earners still in their prime. 
 
3.  (SBU) In addition to militia training for civilians, riot 
police instructors are on a daily training regimen in 
downtown ministry buildings to train civil servants in riot 
control tactics.  Local police and public service members are 
provided with refresher and advanced courses in civil 
defense, light arms use, riot control, surveillance, 
communications relay, and property defense.  Emboffs have 
observed militia training in recent weeks, including basic 
military drill instruction for civil servants on the upper 
floors of two ministry buildings in downtown Rangoon.  In 
addition, high-level staff members are reportedly being given 
weapons training. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT: The SPDC officially says the militia 
training is to fend off an \"external attack,\" but it is also 
perceived publicly as an attempt by the regime to distract 
the population from their worsening economic situation. 
Regardless of the motives, militia training is another 
unwelcome SPDC burden for those forced to participate and a 
potentially lethal weapon for use in suppressing opposition 
to the regime.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BURMA SANCTIONS: BUSINESSES ADAPTING IN A FROZEN 
ECONOMY 
 
REF: RANGOON 1118 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Many businesses have adapted fairly well to 
the July economic sanctions on Burma, though overall economic 
activity has dropped notably.  Many have embraced trade in 
euros, while some have sought to move their traditional 
dollar-based business to the Thai and Chinese borders.  Still 
others are settling their transactions outside of Burma. 
Despite these attempts to adapt, none of these alternatives 
is perfect.  Sanctions will have a long-term impact on the 
economy; however, in the absence of economic reforms, the 
Burmese government remains by far the largest enemy of the 
Burmese economy.  End summary. 
 
Eur-OK With Me 
 
2. (C) Nearly two months since the introduction of additional 
wide-ranging Burma sanctions -- banning imports of Burmese 
goods into the United States and forbidding provision of 
financial services to Burma by U.S. persons -- most Burmese 
traders have settled on one of three options for survival. 
The first option is to try and shift all import and export 
contracts from the U.S. dollar to a different currency, 
predominately the euro.  Prior to the new sanctions, the U.S. 
dollar was the currency of choice for all international 
transactions.  However, the financial services ban, combined 
with the skittishness of most foreign banks to do any U.S. 
dollar business with a Burmese entity, have forced Burmese 
banking authorities and import-export firms to scramble for 
alternatives. 
 
3. (C) The GOB has accommodated desperate traders to some 
degree.  As reported in reftel, in mid-August the Commerce 
Ministry informally issued instructions to banks and 
entrepreneurs to amend values of goods in existing U.S. 
dollar export and import licenses, and all future licenses, 
in Euro, Japanese Yen, or Singapore dollars \"for opening L/Cs 
and for payments.\"  Government trade banks are also allowing 
businesses to open accounts in these alternative currencies. 
Though the government banks will still issue 
dollar-denominated L/Cs, they are forcing the Burmese 
customer to sign a letter assuming all risk of loss. 
 
4. (C) After some confusion and chaos surrounding the sudden 
shift, the situation has settled considerably as the majority 
of companies that must use the banking system are reluctantly 
opening euro accounts and negotiating with buyers and sellers 
to alter their terms of business.  Some large traders have 
even applauded the move, citing the relative stability and 
strength of the euro. 
 
5. (C) There are at least three major flaws in this system, 
which contributed to the initial sharp drop in trade volume 
following the imposition of sanctions (though there has been 
some rebound in recent weeks).  First, some traders 
unfamiliar with the euro, and suspicious of the government\'s 
policies, have been reluctant to make the switch, instead 
basically ceasing their legal trading operations.  Second, 
some foreign exporters -- particularly in Asia -- want 
payment in U.S. dollars, and are charging a 6-7 percent 
premium to amend contracts into euros to cover foreign 
exchange risk.  Interestingly, Burmese importers with whom we 
spoke seemed totally unaware of the OFAC license allowing for 
U.S. dollar financial transactions pursuant to exports to 
Burma.  Finally, the euro has little use on the street here. 
No black market has evolved and the government banks are not 
allowing euro account holders to withdraw their euros -- only 
to convert to U.S. dollars and then withdraw them as normal 
in Foreign Exchange Certificates.  The euro only has value to 
traders who can use their euro export earnings to get 
euro-denominated import licenses from the government -- which 
requires importers to have foreign exchange in the bank to 
cover any imports. 
 
Run For the Border 
 
6. (C) The second option, for businesspeople trading with 
China or Thailand, is an expansion of border trade operations 
-- both licit and illicit -- which can be done in several 
currencies without relying on L/Cs.  This is an imperfect 
solution.  While it avoids the euro hassles, it entails 
additional transportation and other \"administrative\" costs. 
Traders are not able to move the same volume of product that 
they had previously imported or exported via container.  This 
method is also not a good substitute for those dealing in 
large capital goods.  Though the GOB is easing settlement 
procedures for legal border trade, permission to import 
remains tightly controlled.  Though rumors persist that the 
government will liberalize import licenses for border 
commerce, this has not yet occurred.  Traders report that for 
legal border transactions they still must contend with the 
increasingly tight-fisted import license process administered 
by the Ministry of Commerce, and directed by SPDC Vice 
Chairman General Maung Aye. 
 
7. (C) Because of these obstacles, legal border trade has not 
increased much since sanctions -- though many traders are 
setting up shop in border entrepots.  However, we\'ve heard 
that there has already been an expansion of black market 
importing.  With diminishing legal trade, due both to the 
sanctions and the government\'s continued tight control on 
import licenses, shortages of consumer goods and some 
commodities (such as rubber resin) have appeared in Rangoon. 
When possible, traders have seized on these shortages to 
expand their importing of the needed product, import license 
or no, to fill the gap. 
 
Keeping it at Arm\'s Length 
 
8. (C) A final option for traders, particularly exporters, is 
to conduct settlements in U.S. dollars outside of Burma -- 
primarily in Singapore and Hong Kong.  Traders report that 
two Singaporean banks in particular are being used to settle 
L/Cs in U.S. dollars via intra-bank transfer between a 
Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) account and the account of 
a buyer/seller in the same bank.  The offshore U.S. dollars 
are either kept abroad or remitted to Burma using hundi. 
Burmese entrepreneurs tell us that so far the GOB is 
accepting this method of settlement, provided the proper 
import licenses are held and export taxes are paid.  However, 
one well-connected trader opined that the government will 
have to crack down on this soon, as it is reducing the amount 
of hard currency coming into Burma. 
 
Comment: Sanctions Can\'t Take the Whole Blame/Credit 
 
9. (C) Despite the fact that Burma\'s wily business community 
is adapting to the new economic realities, the sanctions will 
have some long-term negative impact on the economy.  Traders 
are unanimous that without counterbalancing economic reforms, 
sanctions will contribute to a significant decline in overall 
trade volume (though an increase in border trade will make up 
some of this decline) and a net outflow of foreign exchange. 
Many export-focused manufacturers and small trading companies 
may go under -- with possible benefits for larger, better 
connected firms.  Price increases are also a real possibility 
with the shortages of imported goods, especially those not 
easily replaceable via border trade.  However, the chilly 
business environment and persistent banking problems will 
also keep money supply and velocity sluggish, which may 
continue to hold down inflationary pressures. 
 
10. (C) However, it is important to remember that sanctions 
are not the only, or even the primary, cause of Burma\'s 
economic troubles.  Traders with whom we spoke blame the 
government\'s ongoing tightfisted import license policy, where 
approvals run at only 25-50 percent of requests, as much as 
sanctions for the bleak trade picture.  Also, businessmen 
have confided in us that they, and many of their colleagues, 
are leaving the country for \"awhile\" or easing back on their 
business operations because they find operating in the 
current business climate too treacherous.  Their discontent 
comes not only from the chaos caused by sanctions, but also 
from the general mismanagement of the economy by the 
government, and the GOB\'s increasingly aggressive policy of 
pressuring businesses to take on unprofitable or risky deals 
in the \"national interest.\"

1. (C) Summary: On September 23, ASSK\'s doctor again briefed 
diplomats on her post-surgery recovery and reported that 
biopsy reports indicated tissue removed during the operation 
was non-malignant, but that surgery had been the only option 
to address a \"pre-cancerous\" condition.  Over 150 NLD 
supporters assembled at the hospital today, braving a heavy 
military intelligence presence with hand-written signs of 
support for the NLD leader and the pro-democracy movement. 
The Indonesian Embassy declined to give a briefing to 
diplomats on the Alatas visit, or to affirm whether the envoy 
has requested a meeting with ASSK.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) In a now daily routine, ASSK\'s personal physician, Dr. 
Tin Myo Win, briefed us on September 23 at the Asia Royal 
Cardiac Hospital where she is recuperating from September 19 
surgery.  At our request, and that of the British Embassy, 
diplomats from the French, Italian, German, and Japanese 
embassies joined us for the briefing.  The enlarged 
diplomatic group drew close scrutiny from SPDC military 
intelligence officers who filmed the entire briefing. 
 
3. (C) Dr. Tin Myo Win reported that ASSK is eating regular 
meals and is medically capable of receiving visitors, 
although he said \"no one has yet been allowed to see her, 
other than her physicians and military liaison officers.\" 
The doctor said that many supporters had requested an 
opportunity to see ASSK, but that as her physician he 
believed it appropriate for only \"one or two special guests\" 
to visit (Note: the doctor\'s implication was that he believes 
ASSK would welcome a visit by Indonesian special envoy 
Alatas, who is currently in Rangoon, and U.N. Special Envoy 
Razali, who is expected in Burma on September 30.  The 
Italian Ambassador told us that he had contacted the 
Indonesian Ambassador to seek a briefing on the Alatas visit 
for E.U. (and U.S.) Embassies.  His Indonesian counterpart 
refused to say whether Alatas has requested a meeting with 
ASSK and said he would consider giving a briefing on the 
Alatas visit \"after Bali.\"  To this, the Italian Ambassador 
responded to the Indonesian, \"You must be joking.\"  ASSK 
confidante Leon de Riedmatten told us he got the same 
reaction from the Indonesian Embassy.  End note). 
 
4. (C) Dr. Tin Myo Win told the assembled diplomats that he 
had received post-surgery biopsy reports, which indicated 
that the \"organ\" he had removed was non-malignant.  However, 
he added that he could not determine what specific disease 
had afflicted ASSK and that surgery had been the only option 
to address her \"pre-cancerous\" condition (Note: Dr. Tin Myo 
Win will not reveal her specific malady, but media and local 
sources speculate that ASSK had an emergency hysterectomy. 
End note). 
 
5. (C) Queried whether ASSK would be returned to detention, 
Dr. Tin Myo Win said he had requested on medical grounds that 
he have daily access to the NLD leader after she is 
discharged from the hospital.  He added that this would be 
most easily accomplished at her home compound, but that this 
decision would be made by the \"authorities.\" 
 
6. (C) Over 150 NLD supporters were peacefully assembled 
today in front of the hospital while the diplomats met across 
the street with ASSK\'s doctor (in the same automotive repair 
shop used for previous briefings; see reftel).  Most of the 
supporters were holding small signs that wished ASSK a speedy 
recovery, although several held photos of the democracy 
leader and signs written in English that read \"Freedom from 
All Pain.\" (Note: Traditionally, such minor expressions of 
protest have resulted in detention and long prison sentences. 
 End note.) 
 
7. (C) Comment: We believe that ASSK\'s doctor is quietly 
attempting to convince the SPDC to transfer her to house 
arrest, rather than return her to detention at an undisclosed 
military compound.  Although our ultimate objective is her 
complete release, house arrest would be a small step in the 
right direction toward her eventual freedom.  End comment.

1. (SBU) Summary:  After claiming with much fanfare to have 
had a USD 700 million trade surplus last year (a claim 
doubted by most not dressed in a uniform), the Burmese 
government will not likely repeat the farce this year. 
Admittedly making an accurate assessment of Burma\'s trade 
balance is a fool\'s errand, as much of the Burmese trade 
balance is unaccounted for (narcotics out, weapons in, and 
everyone cheating on invoices).  However, we can predict that 
if economic bumbling continues, tough new U.S. economic 
sanctions ought to put the official trade balance into the 
red for the current fiscal year (ending March 30, 2004).  End 
summary. 
 
Legally, Exports and Imports are Down... 
 
2. (C) The prognosis for the country\'s primary export 
commodities is mixed, but generally down.  Imports are also 
suffering from increasingly tight government controls.  We 
are loath to make any firm statement on dollar amounts, as 
reliable statistics are not provided by the GOB.  Numbers we

in FY 2002-03, according to the GOB).  Reliable energy 
industry sources estimate that natural gas sales to Thailand 
from the offshore Yetagun and Yadana fields will amount to 
USD 650 million - USD 700 million this calendar year (though 
Burmese government estimates are closer to USD 900 million). 
Despite U.S. sanctions that ban the remittance of U.S. 
dollars into Burma, natural gas payments will likely remain 
in U.S. dollars, payable into Burmese government accounts in 
Singapore.  Forecast: Stable and solid foreign exchange 
earner. 
 
(ii) Timber: The official forecast for timber (mostly teak) 
exports, the second largest export in FY 2002-03 accounting 
for about USD 300 million, is bad.  One experienced timber 
merchant told us that the government had not allowed any new 
private cutting permits or private exports of sawn timber 
since May.  The reason is unclear, but the source told us the 
regime was reassessing all private sector contracts to try 
and eradicate, or re-apportion, some of the corruption that 
plagues the timber industry.  Three notes: Unless timber 
exporters find a replacement market, the cut-off of exports 
to the United States could slice USD 3 million off Burma\'s 
export earnings.  Second, the government has the monopoly on, 
and continues to export, logs and some sawn timber -- with 
tenders now denominated in euro.  Finally, official 
statistics and our forecasts do not take into account the 
significant illegal logging that occurs, particularly by 
businesses operated by Kachin ceasefire groups in the 
Kachin-China border zones.  Forecast: Legally down 
significantly. 
 
(iii) Beans and Pulses: Exports of beans and pulses (9 
percent of exports in FY 2002-03), almost entirely to India, 
will remain a reliable export, though volume and earnings 
will likely dip.  Earnings will be hit by declining quality 
combined with a near monopsony by Indian buyers and soft 
demand.  Agribusiness contacts tell us the beans and pulses 
trade (not easily moved to border trade) has adapted to U.S. 
sanctions by moving offshore, with settlements of contracts 
done in U.S. dollars in Singapore banks.  However, volume is 
still 25 percent off of what it was last year at this time, 
after dropping 50 percent or more in the weeks after the 
sanctions were applied.  Forecast: Down significantly. 
 
(iv) Seafood: Fish and prawns, accounting for about USD 150 
million in FY 2002-03, are a relative bright spot.  The new 
import ban will cut into export earnings and volume -- 
possibly USD 10 million for CY 2003.  However, reliable 
sources have told us some exporters have been sending their 
products to Malaysia and Indonesia for relabeling and onward 
export to the United States.  Also hitting export volume, 
many seafood exporters are voluntarily cutting back their 
business rather than face government pressure to use their 
export earnings to import government-priority items.  On the 
other hand, some opportunistic seafood exporters are taking 
advantage of the situation to expand exports, using euro 
L/Cs, in exchange for GOB promises of import licenses to 
bring in potentially lucrative diesel and palm oil shipments. 
 Also, FDI in the fisheries sector is comparatively good 
(about USD 26 million in FY 2002-03).  Forecast: Stable and 
reasonably reliable foreign exchange earner. 
 
(v) Rice: A real unknown.  Without warning in April the 
government announced the liberalization of rice exports -- a 
long-desired agricultural reform.  Thus far, major private 
sector exporters are wary of jumping in because of very 
uncertain profit margins due to high domestic prices, low 
international prices, and unclear government pricing and 
profit-sharing provisions of the new policy.  However, some 
companies and associations close to the government will take 
the plunge, and the parastatal agricultural product exporter, 
Myanmar Agricultural Product Trading (MAPT), will likely play 
a behind-the-scenes role to ensure the policy has some 
\"successes\" in its inaugural season.  Production levels are 
still uncertain, with the harvest due to start in October or 
November.  The weather has been OK, but farmers this year 
were forced to plant without access to the credit they 
normally received from the government via controversial 
advance purchasing agreements -- canceled under the new 
policy.  The government has said that only surplus rice that 
is not needed domestically can be exported, but there are not 
reliable statistics for production or domestic demand. 
Forecast: Down, but by how much is not yet clear. 
 
(vi) Garments: The Burmese government does not consider 
garments a major export product, though the sector relies on 
exports to the United States.  The revenue from garment 
exports is in the form of fees for the piece work the Burmese 
factories provide rather than from the sales of the garments 
themselves.  Nonetheless, with the U.S. import ban in place, 
the majority of Burmese garment factories will gradually 
shutter -- one estimate was that 99 factories had shut since 
the new sanctions took hold with a loss of 25,000-40,000 
jobs.  Assuming exports to the United States would have held 
steady for the remainder of CY 2003, Burma\'s resulting loss 
in foreign exchange will probably be around USD 20 million, 
with a net loss to GOB coffers of perhaps USD 5 million in 
taxes and fees.  Forecast: Basically zeroed out. 
 
3. (SBU) Though overall exports look weaker this year, the 
government has been squeezing tight on imports as well.  The 
regime still requires all import licenses be backed by 
dollars earned by exporting.  Even with these export dollars 
in hand, traders complain heartily of the government\'s recent 
refusals to approve more than 25-50 percent of an importer\'s 
request.  Though this import policy has been particularly 
miserly in the last six months, we see it worsening as the 
country\'s foreign exchange reserves decline due to sanctions 
and drooping exports. 
 
...But What\'s Law Got To Do With It? 
 
4. (SBU) When pondering trade balances, you have to consider 
the uncountable informal trade flows that wash across the 
Chinese, Thai, and Bangladeshi borders.  There are also a 
number of intangible factors that arise due to the convoluted 
nature of the Burmese economy and the mind-bending 
distortions it creates.  These two aspects of Burma\'s 
international trade make an accurate assessment of trade 
balance quite tricky. 
 
5. (C) On the export side, Burma remains a major producer of 
illegal narcotics (opium and amphetamine type substances), 
though this export commodity is also suffering from increased 
regional vigilance.  Ceasefire groups also conduct a very 
lucrative and undocumented trade in timber and gems, 
particularly from Kachin State.  Rice paddy is also illegally 
shoveled in vast quantities into the Bangladeshi maw. 
Finally, exporters are famous for lying on their manifests -- 
declaring only 70 percent of the true value of their sales to 
authorities, and receiving the difference in hard currency 
under the table from sympathetic foreign buyers. 
 
6. (C) In recent days, exports are also suffering as imports 
get squeezed.  The reason?  Exporters have made piles of 
money selling their export revenue at a tidy premium to 
importers desperate for cash (remember, importers can only 
import as much as they have export foreign exchange to pay). 
As the demand for legal imports drops, the demand (and thus 
market premium) for the export dollars drops.  The loss of 
this profitable side business is another disincentive to 
exporting at full capacity (see Reftel for discussion of 
other exporting barriers). 
7. (C) Imports are equally mysterious, with most \"sensitive\" 
government imports such as weapons and military equipment, 
and training and technology for the alleged Magway Division 
nuclear power plant all going off book.  Importers are also 
notorious for undervaluing their shipments, a necessary evil 
with the GOB\'s reluctance to grant the full amount requested 
for import licenses. 
 
Comment: Can the Government Help? 
 
8. (C) Government financiers and local entrepreneurs are at a 
loss at how the GOB could refloat easily the sinking legal 
trading sector.  Already the government has encouraged 
official trade in hard currency other than dollars, and has 
liberalized the settlement process for legal border trade 
(see Reftel for explanation).  Allowing the private sector to 
engage in barter trade would help exporters and importers as 
would further liberalization of border trade, like loosening 
import license restrictions.  However, in previous 
experiments along these lines the government witnessed a 
sharp rise in imports (and outflow of foreign exchange) with 
little benefit to uncompetitive exports.  With the foreign 
exchange situation likely to get more precarious, we don\'t 
think the GOB will go down that road again.

1. (C) SUMMARY: The Union Solidarity and Development 
Association (USDA), a mass membership organization sponsored 
by the ruling SPDC, staged massive rallies on September 20 in 
Rangoon and Mandalay as a show of support for Prime Minister 
General Khin Nyunt\'s \"Road Map to Democracy.\"  The junta will 
repeat these rigid, tightly controlled mass rallies in the 
remaining division and state capitals over the next three 
weeks.  On September 22, SPDC Chairman Senior General Than 
Shwe appointed thirteen new members to the National 
Convention Convening Commission, a group that is dominated by 
senior military officers, like the Commission\'s executive 
leadership selected several weeks ago (ref a).  The rallies 
and appointments are further signs that the SPDC is moving 
toward convening the National Convention without the 
participation of the democratic opposition.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) On September 20, the USDA held massive political 
rallies in Rangoon and Mandalay to drum up support for the 
SPDC\'s seven-step \"Road Map to Democracy\" (ref b).  According 
to GOB and independent sources, over 15,000 USDA partisans 
and members of government organizations packed an indoor 
arena in downtown Rangoon, and nearly 20,000 participated in 
a similar event held at an outdoor sports stadium in 
Mandalay.  USDA members from a cross section of Burma\'s civil 
service, blue collar, and artisan classes attended, all 
carefully segregated by professional occupation and dressed 
in USDA-mandated uniforms for each of their columns. 
 
3. (SBU) The regime\'s official newspaper, the New Light of 
Myanmar, has given four straight days of front page coverage 
to the rallies, including photos of thousands of youths lined 
up in neat civilian uniforms.  The images of uniformed and 
thoroughly bored USDA partisans eerily bring to mind rallies 
of yesteryear totalitarian regimes.  Pictures of the rallies 
also appeared on the SPDC\'s website (www.myanmar.com), 
including images of USDA brass leading slogans with raised, 
clenched fists. 
 
4. (U) On September 23, SPDC Chairman Senior General Than 
Shwe appointed thirteen new members to the National 
Convention Convening Commission, the body responsible for 
oversight of a National Convention and the drafting of a new 
constitution.  Six of the new members are senior military 
officers, including Brigadier General Than Tun, who serves as 
the regime\'s liaison with Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT:  This is the first time the SPDC\'s 
mouthpiece, \"The New Light of Myanmar,\" has given extensive 
coverage to USDA activities since the May 30 Depeyin attack 
on ASSK and NLD supporters.  USDA members played a key role 
in planning and carrying out that attack.  Holding such large 
rallies now, coupled with SPDC promotions of local officials 
associated with the attack, are strong indications that the 
junta feels very secure in its control over the democratic 
opposition.  As for next steps, we have no clear indication 
on a timeline for reconvening the National Convention. 
However, given heavy military control of the Convening 
Commission and the prominent role the SPDC has carved out for 
itself in any potential transition, local Burmese joke that 
the \"Myanmar Road Map\" is really nothing more than a \"MI 
(Military Intelligence) Road Map.\"  END COMMENT.

1. (C) Thai Embassy officials in Rangoon deny press reports 
that Thai Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai came to 
Rangoon for a one day visit on September 25, but said he will 
be coming for a visit next week.  However, other local 
diplomatic sources and international press stringers insist 
that the Thai FM arrived in Rangoon this morning on a private

that he came to town to meet SPDC leaders to discuss the

Embassy Rangoon reports that their colleagues in Bangkok

2. (C) Comment: We gather that it would not be unusual for 
the Thai Embassy to be uninformed about a \"quiet diplomacy\" 
visit of their Foreign Minister or other senior Thai 
officials.  However, Thai diplomats here have informed us 
that Prime Minister Thaksin is expected in Rangoon in 
November, along with his Cambodian and Lao counterparts, for 
a meeting of the \"Economic Cooperation Strategy (ECS),\" 
apparently a Thai initiative aimed at bringing poor ASEAN 
performers up to speed with the rest of the region.

1. (C) Summary:  He came, he saw, he left.  Indonesian 
special envoy Ali Alitas made a four-day visit September 
21-24 to deliver personal messages to the SPDC from President 
Megawati.  In his own words, he did not want to \"impose\" on 
the regime with regard to ASSK and accepted at face value the 
SPDC\'s claim that the democracy leader was not medically 
cleared to receive visitors (a claim contradicted by ASSK\'s 
personal physician, ref b).  According to the Indonesian 
Ambassador here, Indonesia does not want \"extraneous issues\" 
(referring to the detention of ASSK) to affect the agenda at 
the upcoming ASEAN summit in Bali, which will focus on less 
controversial themes.  By all accounts, the Alatas visit may 
lead the SPDC to believe that they will not be called to task 
in Bali for their recent misdeeds.  End summary. 
 
Alatas Visit: His Own Take 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (C) On September 24, Indonesian special envoy Ali Alatas 
gave a press briefing on his four-day visit to Burma, just 
prior to his return to Jakarta.  According to the British DCM 
here, who was allowed to attend the briefing, Alatas insisted 
that he came to Burma as a special envoy of President 
Megawati, not as a representative of ASEAN (note: his point 
was foreshadowed by the GOB, per ref A.  end note.)  Alatas 
downplayed his visit and offered that the SPDC is \"carefully 
and positively\" considering ASSK\'s detention, which the 
regime described as \"temporary and for her own protection.\" 
Alatas concluded he was \"satisfied\" with his visit, but said 
that it would be for others to judge the success of his brief 
stay.  After Alatas told the press that he did not see ASSK 
because the GOB had informed him she did not have \"medical 
clearance\" for a personal visit, our British colleague took 
the envoy aside and told him that ASSK\'s physician had 
declared her medically fit to receive guests.  Alatas replied 
that he didn\'t want to \"impose\" on the authorities with 
regard to with ASSK. 
 
The Indonesian Embassy Version 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) On September 25, Indonesian Ambassador-designate Wyoso 
Prodjowarsito gave a one-hour briefing to the diplomatic 
corps on the Alatas visit.  (Note: The Indonesian Ambassador 
has been in Rangoon for only one month and has not yet 
presented credentials.  End note).  Joining the COM were 
Ambassadors and/or Charges from the UK, Italy, Korea, 
Germany, France, Australia, and Japan.  A junior diplomat 
from China and Leon de Reidmatten, local liaison for U.N. 
Special Envoy Razali, also attended. 
 
4. (C) According to Prodjowarsito, Alatas met on Monday 
September 22 for one hour with Prime Minister General Khin 
Nyunt and on Tuesday September 22 for 45 minutes with SPDC 
Chairman Senior General Than Shwe.  Participants in the 
latter session included Khin Nyunt, SPDC Vice Chairman 
General Maung Aye, SPDC Secretary 1, Secretary 2, and \"many 
other officials.\"  Alatas\' only other official meeting was 
dinner with the Deputy Foreign Minister after his arrival on 
Sunday.  The \"spirit\" of Alatas\' meetings with the PM and 
with Than Shwe was very cordial, and Alatas was impressed 
that the SPDC Chairman conducted his entire meeting in 
English. 
 
5. (C) On the basis of Indonesia and Burma\'s \"long-standing 
friendship, dating back to their struggles for independence,\" 
Alatas delivered a personal letter from Megawati to Senior 
General Than Shwe and an invitation to PM Khin Nyunt to 
attend the ASEAN Bali Conference in October (the PM 
apparently accepted the invitation).  Prodjowarsito said that 
Megawati\'s letter to Than Shwe \"did not mention ASSK.\" 
Alatas believes that the seven-point \"Burma Roadmap to 
Democracy\" will be implemented faithfully with the 
\"participation of all parties,\" including the NLD and ethnic 
groups.  Alatas did not pressure either the PM or Than Shwe 
on a timeframe for the implementation of the roadmap, but 
believes that \"it will be implemented faithfully.\"  His 
meetings focused on \"big picture issues\" outlined in the 
roadmap and especially the prospect of transition to a 
market-oriented economy. 
 
6. (C) Prodjowarsito said that President Megawati had no 
intention to pressure the GOB and \"the special envoy had no 
intention to pressure for the release of ASSK.\"  Although 
Alitas had planned to see ASSK, PM Khin Nyunt advised him 
that \"her condition was good, but her doctor advised against 
visitors.\"  In any case, Prodjowarsito said, seeing ASSK was 
not Alatas\' priority.  However, Alatas did tell PM Khin Nyunt 
that Indonesia did not want ASSK\'s continued detention to be 
\"counterproductive,\" either to the ASEAN agenda in Bali or to 
overall progress on the SPDC\'s roadmap.  Alatas did raise the 
\"tragedy\" of May 30 with the PM, who responded that ASSK\'s 
detention is temporary and that \"she will be released from 
the guest house,\" but offered no timeframe. 
 
7. (C) Ambassador Prodjowarsito emphasized that Indonesia 
does not want \"extraneous issues\" (referring to the detention 
of ASSK) to affect the Bali agenda, which will focus on more 
cooperative themes such as a \"Bali declaration.\"  He said 
that there is currently no specific agenda item dedicated to 
a Burma discussion, but explained that Burma issues can be 
raised under an agenda item titled \"Current Developments.\" 
 
And On To The Next Visitor 
-------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Leon De Reidmatten told the group that U.N. Special 
Envoy Razali will arrive in Rangoon the morning of September 
30 and depart on October 2.  However, de Riedmatten did not 
indicate that the SPDC has confirmed a meeting with either 
ASSK or Than Shwe.  De Riedmatten said this 11th visit will 
be different from previous visits, as Razali will have to 
evolve from \"being a facilitator into being a negotiator.\" 
Razali will need to negotiate the composition of a reconvened 
National Convention, from which the regime has to date 
excluded the democratic opposition.  De Riedmatten said that 
Razali will also need at least two meetings each with the PM, 
Than Shwe, and ASSK in order to \"negotiate a compromise 
between the regime and the lady.\" 
 
Comment: Off the Hook in Bali? 
------------------------------ 
 
9. (C)  We are not privy to the contents of the 
correspondence delivered by Alatas to the SPDC.  However, his 
public diplomacy here in Rangoon was disappointing.  He 
missed a rare opportunity to visit with ASSK, seek her views 
on the situation prior to the ASEAN summit, and offer her 
regional support in the aftermath of the SPDC\'s premeditated 
and violent attack of May 30.  This \"soft\" approach may 
encourage the regime to not return ASSK to detention after 
her pending hospital discharge.  However, it is likely that 
Alatas\' \"friendly\" visit leaves the generals with the 
impression that they will not have to account for their many 
misdeeds when they meet with their regional counterparts in 
Bali.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S MAGIC FEC: WHAT GOES DOWN MUST COME UP 
 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: After following closely the gyrations of 
the U.S. dollar/kyat market exchange rate, the Burmese 
Foreign Exchange Certificate\'s (FEC) value has diverged 
significantly in recent months.  Sharp dips and climbs 
unrelated to the greenback are very unusual, and no solid 
explanation is available for recent occurrences.  However, 
the recent moves have reinvigorated speculation over the 
FEC\'s future with no satisfactory conclusions except that the 
increasingly useless FEC has little importance to the Burmese 
economy.  End summary. 
 
The SPDC and its FEC 
 
2. (SBU) The Foreign Exchange Certificate (FEC) was 
introduced in 1993, as a way for exporters, Burmese 
nationals, and others who earned foreign exchange to withdraw 
their money from government banks -- the only banks 
authorized to hold foreign currency -- without the GOB losing 
any of the precious cash.  The FEC cannot be converted back 
into hard currency, ensuring that the government would get 
every penny of the mandated USD 300, later USD 200, 
conversion to FEC imposed on foreign independent travelers 
from 1994 until August of this year.  The banks hand out FECs 
at a 1 FEC to USD 1 rate, with FEC in theory backed by actual 
foreign exchange reserves.  At first, the FEC could be 
exchanged legally at only the official 6 kyat/FEC rate. 
However, in July 2001 authorities bowed to the active black 
market and changed the authorized FEC rate to 450 kyat/FEC -- 
still lower than the market rate prevailing at the time. 
 
3. (SBU) With the continued weakening of the economy, 
increasing inflation, and depreciating kyat, the FEC\'s black 
market value has strayed significantly from its fixed 450 
kyat value -- maxing out at 1095 kyat/FEC in October 2002. 
However, during most of this period the FEC/kyat value tended 
to track fairly closely the gyrations of the USD/kyat rate. 
Until the spring of 2003, the FEC/USD gap was stable, with 
the greenback worth about 5-10 percent more, widening 
occasionally to 15-20 percent depending on the comparative 
demand for the more liquid, but illegal, U.S. dollar vs. the 
legal, but less useful and non-covertible, FEC. 
 
4. (SBU) The FEC/USD gap began to widen in early May 2003 as 
the dollar\'s relative stability against the kyat was not 
matched by a steadily weakening FEC.  Talk of the FEC\'s 
abolition, a recurring theme in the country\'s hyperactive 
rumor mill, fed this move out of FEC.  The FEC dove 26 
percent in late June/early July as merchants became 
increasingly reluctant to accept FEC at par with the U.S. 
dollar.  Even some government businesses, previously willing 
to accept or even mandating payment in FEC, refused to take 
it.  After a brief FEC revival, the GOB\'s removal of its 
airport FEC counters on August 15th was taken as evidence by 
many of imminent demonetization of the FEC, and brought the 
FEC crashing down to 540 kyat/FEC on August 19 -- its lowest 
point in two years.  Because many were at the same time 
buying up U.S. dollars in anticipation of the impact of U.S. 
sanctions, in late August the FEC/USD gap reach an historic 
level, about 42 percent. 
 
5. (SBU) Beginning in mid-August a strange reversal of the 
FEC\'s fortunes began.  Predictably, because of continued 
import controls, combined with a move by the government to 
respond to new U.S. sanctions by denominating all letters of 
credit in euro, the dollar\'s value against the kyat slipped 
-- down 5 percent by mid-September.  However, for no apparent 
reason, the FEC went the other direction rocketing 45 percent 
against the kyat during that period.  By late September, the 
yawning USD/FEC gap had closed to 15 percent. 
 
What Gives? 
 
6. (C) Understanding how currencies move in Burma is a 
difficult task even when they do what they\'re \"supposed\" to. 
When one of the three (kyat, U.S. dollar, FEC) does something 
starkly counterintuitive, comprehension is all the more 
elusive.  However, the reviving FEC may be a result of a 
concentrated strategy by some actor or actors to reduce the 
supply of FEC in the marketplace while sparking speculative 
demand.  The demise of the garment sector, largely due to new 
U.S. sanctions banning imports of Burmese goods into the 
United States, is another apparent factor. 
 
7. (C) On the supply side, the most obvious change is the 
removal on August 15th of the requirement for all foreign 
tourists to exchange USD 200 into 200 FEC.  Overnight, and 
without subsequent explanation, the authorities removed the 
exchange counter from the Rangoon airport arrivals hall. 
More diaphanous evidence of a supply-side explanation comes 
to us from an array of business sources who report it very 
difficult to find large supplies of FEC from the usual black 
market brokers. 
 
8. (SBU) Problems in the country\'s garment sector may also be 
impacting the supply of FEC.  Garment factories, employing 
100,000-200,000 workers, generally changed FEC export 
earnings into kyat to pay salaries.  Now that many of these 
factories are closed and many employees have been laid off, 
this monthly infusion of FEC is no longer occurring. 
 
9. (C) On the demand side, a coordinated campaign of rumors 
may be encouraging some speculative demand.  Currently, very 
few businesses are obligated to accept FEC -- international 
hotels, airlines, and some government utilities for example. 
However, several of our most reliable business sources have 
independently reported to us that various 
government-controlled commodities previously sold in U.S. 
dollars -- most notably sugar, GSM cellphones, and gems (the 
biannual international gems emporium is coming up in 
mid-October) -- must now be purchased only with FEC.  Sources 
also reported that Myanma Petroleum Products Enterprise, the 
parastatal gasoline and diesel retailer, is now selling large 
amounts of diesel only in FEC.  However, these rumors seem to 
have little backing.  Government entities controlling these 
commodities deny that there has been any change in their 
previous U.S. dollar-only policy, but it\'s clear that the 
rumors are out there and may be leading to some speculative 
purchasing or hoarding of FECs. 
 
Comment: What Lies Ahead for the FEC? 
 
10. (SBU) The FEC\'s future is as uncertain as its recent 
levitation.  Other than to \"save face\" by prolonging a worn 
out policy, or protect the hoarded wealth of a few generals, 
the GOB has no real reason to keep the FEC, as there are very 
few practical uses for it.  Even most Burmese paid in foreign 
exchange (such as Embassy, UN, and international NGO 
employees) never make FEC withdrawals, instead transferring 
the foreign exchange in their bank accounts into the account 
of a broker who gives them an \"account transfer\" kyat rate -- 
usually somewhere between the current black market rates for 
FEC and U.S. dollars.  Presuming currency laws would continue 
to prohibit Burmese citizens from holding foreign exchange, 
abolishing the FEC might even give a boost to demand for the 
beleaguered kyat -- shops and utilities accepting FEC would 
have to convert to kyat. 
 
11. (SBU) Some argue that the current appreciation of the FEC 
is a GOB plot to informally eliminate the FEC by gradually 
removing it from circulation.  More likely, though, after 
this current inexplicable blip, the FEC will remain in the 
market and resume its normal role as a safer, but 
second-best, choice for cash holdings.  Either way, the FEC 
has been so marginalized in recent months that we don\'t see 
much impact on the economy for the better or worse.

1. (C) SUMMARY: A MOFA official told us that the GOB will 
host a \"major\" (by Burmese standards) summit the first week 
of November.  Thai, Lao, and Cambodian heads of government 
will meet with their SPDC counterpart to pursue the Thai-led 
\"Economic Cooperation Strategy (ECS).\"  According to MOFA 
sources, the Indian Vice President will visit Burma prior to 
the summit.  The SPDC will be happy to host the summit to 
accommodate PM Thaksin\'s strategy while at the same time 
trying to improve their post-May 30 international image.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Americas Director Thant 
Kyaw verified to Poloff that, during the first week of 
November, heads of government from Thailand, Laos, and 
Cambodia will attend what he characterized as \"Burma\'s 
first-ever summit meeting.\"  The summit will be held in the 
ancient royal capital of Bagan, in central Burma, and MOFA 
expects over 200 participants to attend.  The GOB is now 
forming subcommittees for the meeting and MOFA directors are 
frantically scrambling to prepare the infrastructure-poor 
tourist site for the onslaught.  Kyaw also said the Indian 
Vice President will visit Rangoon for consultations with the 
SPDC just prior to the ECS summit. 
 
3.  (C) Thant Kyaw also relayed that Thai Foreign Minister 
Surakiart, during his September 25 half-day visit (reftels A 
and B), met with the entire Burmese cabinet and SPDC Chairman 
Sr Gen Than Shwe, as well as separately with Prime Minister 
General Khin Nyunt and the Burmese Deputy Foreign Minister. 
Thant Kyaw commented that Rangoon, with large hotels and 
conference rooms, was a much better choice for the ECS 
Summit, and that the MOFA Americas Division staff would be 
completely occupied with the summit from now until its end. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT:  This summit, a major deal for isolated 
Burma, will likely be used by the regime as a chance to turn 
the spotlight away from domestic woes and repair its post May 
30th image.  The summit will provide neighbors with a 
post-ASEAN opportunity to help legitimize the SPDC and give 
further support to the regime\'s \"Road Map to Democracy.\"  END

     B. RANGOON 1164 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: After a promising start, Burma\'s efforts in 
2003 to implement its year-old money laundering law have 
fallen well shy of international expectations.  The likely 
culprits?  The collapse of the private banking sector, 
persistent corrupt cronyism, and a lack of technical 
capacity.  Since none of these problems is easily fixable, 
Burma may not meet stringent international standards for some 
time -- though we expect some progress in 2004.  End summary. 
 
One Step Forward, Long Drift Back 
 
2. (SBU) The Burmese money laundering law was greeted with 
much international approval and optimism when it was issued 
in June 2002.  Indeed, as reported in Reftels A, the first 
months after the law\'s enactment were encouraging as Burmese 
law enforcement officials participated in regional financial 
crime seminars and the GOB held its own training for 
financial investigators in Rangoon and Mandalay. 
 
3. (C) Since then however, and despite pressure by the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF), there has been little 
progress in developing any of the implementing regulations 
crucial for the 2002 law to have any effect.  In Burma, new 
laws are not enforceable until all necessary rules and 
regulations are in place.  According to knowledgeable GOB 
sources, the regulations have been drafted three different 
times since June 2002, and the latest version is now with 
relevant ministries (Home Affairs, Finance, and Agriculture) 
for comment.  Ministry comment is only the second of a 4-step 
process that ends with final consideration by the Cabinet. 
There are at least three possibilities for the delays in 
getting needed rules: (1) the February 2003 collapse of the 
private banks; (2) the traditional conflict between the 
written law and the \"verbal law\" of the senior leadership and 
its cronies; and, (3) a lack of technical expertise. 
 
Banks Sink 
 
4. (C) As reported in Reftels B, the private banking sector 
in Burma is under water.  Following a run on private banks in 
February, these institutions basically shut down -- rationing 
withdrawals, and not offering new deposits or loans. 
According to a senior GOB official, the fragility of the 
private banking sector has made authorities very wary of 
imposing strict new reporting requirements on the banks. 
Indeed, when the law was first passed, expectations that 
banks would have to report transactions over 500,000 kyat 
(around US$500) to the Central Bank sparked a mini-run on a 
few of the banks -- especially those with alleged ties to 
criminal activities.  With this in mind, one former 
government banker told us he thought the banking crisis had 
essentially killed motivation in the Finance Ministry to push 
forward the necessary money laundering rules. 
 
5. (C) Without these rules, though, public and private banks 
are not obliged to report on any particular deposit.  In 
reality, though, the Central Bank can maintain some 
oversight.  Throughout the current crisis, private bank 
records have been passed daily to Central Bank for review -- 
a trend that will probably continue.  Also, a former 
government bank official said that state-owned banks would 
probably report any large deposit, unless the customer is 
well-known to the bank -- or to senior government officials. 
 
B\'Zat U B\'Dei = I Am The Law 
 
6. (C) This latter \"know your customer\" exception is 
important.  Senior officials and their family and associates, 
along with most others with any wealth, are regularly 
involved in large, usually undocumented, transactions.  In a 
land where the \"b\'zat u b\'dei\" or \"mouth law\" of high-level 
officials takes precedence over written law, it is thus 
difficult to imagine regulators imposing money laundering 
rules that will be reliably enforced.  One senior economist 
told us that his friends in the private and public banking 
sector understand the need to report large or suspicious 
transactions, but fear the repercussions of informing on 
relatives of senior GOB leadership more than any legal 
penalties. 
 
7. (C) \"Mouth law\" and basic, endemic, corruption have 
hindered enforcement of existing financial regulations.  A 
1986 law that requires proof of origin for funds spent on 
land transactions is poorly enforced because of underpaid 
regulators, institutional cheating on the part of buyers and 
sellers (who often keep the same name on a deed through 
several generations of sales), and the political influence of 
many large landholders. 
 
We Need Help! 
 
8. (C) Though the chicken of regulations must come before the 
egg of enforcement, Burmese law enforcement authorities 
complain that their money laundering efforts will continue to 
fall short of international expectations without more 
technical aid.  It will be essential to staff the nascent 
Financial Intelligence Unit with well-trained investigators. 
However, officials complain these efforts are stymied by 
sanctions that prevent GOB attendance at the International 
Law Enforcement Academy and limit frequent and meaningful 
training with American financial crime specialists. 
 
Now, The Good News 
 
9. (SBU) Even without progress on the 2002 money laundering 
law\'s implementing regulations, Burma still has good tools to 
fight money laundering, and is using them.  Under the 1993 
\'Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\' law, money 
laundering associated with drug trafficking is considered a 
criminal offense and can lead to prosecution and asset 
seizure.  Using this law, authorities have seized more than 1 
billion kyat in assets since 1993.  According to GOB sources, 
80 percent of local money laundering is drug-related, with 
the balance coming largely from gem and timber smuggling. 
 
10. (SBU) Another positive sign, the Ministry of Home Affairs 
(MOHA) -- whose minister holds the chair of the Central 
Control Board established by the 2002 law to oversee GOB 
action against money laundering -- seems quite serious about 
building its law enforcement capacity.  MOHA officials are 
actively courting international assistance and training and 
are emphasizing international liaison work.  MOHA also 
reports the GOB is keen to join the Asia Pacific Review Group 
as a full member, but lacks the funds to pay membership 
expenses. 
 
11. (C) A mutual legal assistance law is being drafted with 
UN assistance to facilitate cooperation between Burma\'s law 
enforcement agencies and their foreign colleagues.  However, 
a GOB official involved in the law\'s drafting said that a 
draft is not yet finalized and there is no timetable for its 
completion or passage.  Another knowledgeable source 
mentioned that the SPDC leadership was somewhat reluctant to 
follow through on this legislation because of possible 
\"foreign interference\" in the government\'s legal process.  In 
the meantime, a Burmese police source said even without a 
formal law or treaties there has been good international 
cooperation on at least two major drug cases, though nothing 
notable since late 2002 (see 02 Rangoon 1553). 
 
Comment: Maybe Next Year 
 
12. (C) In a nutshell, the GOB has had continued success in 
fighting money laundering, but has failed so far to bring its 
overall anti-money laundering legal framework up to snuff. 
As explained above, part of the GOB\'s failure this year 
stemmed from the unexpected meltdown of the financial sector. 
 This problem will remain, as will other, more longstanding, 
barriers.  However, there are elements in the government who 
seem eager to push through necessary regulations and 
legislation -- though subsequent enforcement (especially by 
the weak Central Bank) will be another matter.  Thus, while 
we expect the GOB to make some forward progress in 2004, 
bringing the country\'s anti-money laundering efforts fully up 
to international standards may take some time.

1. (C) Summary: UN Special Envoy Razali departed Rangoon on 
October 2nd, calling his trip a \"total failure.\"  Though he 
did not achieve any tangible results, his visit was important 
in assessing the degree of open mindedness on all sides for 
the SPDC\'s recently announced \"road map to democracy.\"   All 
on the opposition side seemed willing to give the regime\'s 
plan a try, as long as they could freely participate.  The 
regime, though, would not commit to this yet.  Sadly, judging 
from the statements of the autocrat Senior General, it may 
not ever.  End summary. 
 
\"Total Failure,\" But an \"Historic Opportunity\" 
 
2. (SBU) On the evening of October 2nd, UN Special Envoy 
Razali told assembled diplomats that his three day visit to 
Rangoon had been necessary, but \"a total failure\" in getting 
tangible results.  After initial delays, Razali was able to 
meet once with National League for Democracy (NLD) leader 
Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) at her house.  He also met at length 
with Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt, and briefly with 
State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) Chairman Senior 
General Than Shwe.  Razali also spent several hours meeting 
on October 1st with representatives of ethnic minority 
political factions. 
 
3. (SBU) Razali said that he got the impression during his 
meetings with the opposition groups that the Prime Minister\'s 
recently outlined \"road map\" for democratization, beginning 
with a reconvening of the National Convention was being 
viewed as an \"historic opportunity.\"  However, for this 
opportunity to bear fruit, all sides had to participate 
actively and freely both in establishing the modalities for 
the Convention, and in drafting the actual constitution. 
 
ASSK Ready to Rejoin Battle 
 
4. (SBU) Unfortunately, the Prime Minister could not (or 
would not) commit to including the eager opposition groups in 
this way.  Though General Khin Nyunt did not \"reject out of 
hand\" Razali\'s notion that the NLD and other groups be 
included in the National Convention Convening Commission, the 
Prime Minister said it was too early to agree to such a step. 
 Razali opined, and ASSK later agreed, that the Prime 
Minister did not have the \"mandate\" to agree to such an 
initiative -- hinting that the final say on this matter lay 
with the Senior General. 
 
5. (SBU) According to the Special Envoy, ASSK looked healthy, 
was in good spirits, and said she expected to be fully 
recovered \"in a few weeks.\"  He noted that she shared the 
cautious optimism of the ethnic opposition groups, and said 
she was willing \"under certain circumstances\" to work with 
the new Prime Minister and his road map proposals.  However, 
ASSK was adamant that she, the detained members of the NLD 
Central Executive Committee, and those jailed during the 
Depeyin attacks, be released before she would cooperate in 
any way.  She insisted, further, that she would not accept 
release unless these others were released with her.  ASSK was 
also concerned that NLD offices, shuttered after the May 30th 
attack, be re-opened.  However, she apparently did not make 
this a condition for cooperation with Khin Nyunt. 
 
6. (C) Razali indicated that ASSK was still \"incensed\" over 
the May 30th Depeyin ambush.  However, he said in their 
conversation she put the need for an investigation of the 
attack into \"perspective,\" saying that such an inquiry was 
essential \"someday.\" 
 
They\'re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha, Ha! 
 
7. (C) Perhaps the most sobering moment of the briefing was 
Razali\'s description of his session with Senior General Than 
Shwe.  Though the Senior General was in an \"affable mood,\" 
and had \"lost weight,\" he came after Razali right away asking 
if \"one person was more important than the state, than 52 
million people?\"  Razali responded that one person was not, 
but that this one person represented the welfare of the other 
51,999,999.  Than Shwe also insisted that there was no need 
for political parties to represent the will of the people, 
pointing out that the recent \"mass rallies\" (totally stage 
managed by the regime; see ref C) in favor of the road map 
showed that the people already support the government and its 
policies.  This statement verifies in our mind the fact that 
the Senior General has completely lost touch with reality -- 
whether willfully or because of his sycophantic advisors is 
unknown. 
 
Comment: Not Much Hope, For Now 
 
8. (C) The mood of Razali\'s briefing was resigned, but not 
pessimistic.  Clearly the opposition groups, including ASSK, 
are willing to keep an open mind on the SPDC\'s road map. 
Furthermore, the Special Envoy said that he was \"impressed\" 
by the Prime Minister\'s determination \"to do something.\"  A 
pall, though, was cast by the acceptance, spoken and 
unspoken, that the less flexible Senior General was still 
pulling all the strings.  Than Shwe\'s clear hatred of ASSK, 
and his complete removal from reality, are major impediments 
to prospects for genuine progress under the regime\'s new 
initiative.  Nonetheless, Razali indicated that he\'d try to 
come back in a couple of months -- apparently quashing rumors 
that this visit would be his last if there were no success -- 
to see if there was more room for compromise or dialogue.

1. (SBU) Summary: By reviving a second defunct National 
Convention planning committee, and staffing it with 
government officials, the Burmese regime is moving nearer to 
realizing step one of its seven part democracy plan. 
Participation of ethnic minority, and other opposition 
groups, is still nowhere in evidence.  Packing these 
committees with rubber stampers, and refusing to discuss 
modalities of a constitutional convention with any outsiders, 
may expedite the \"successful\" re-convening of the National 
Convention.  However, the farther down the road the GOB goes 
without any buy-in from the opposition, the less chance of 
the SPDC democracy road map leading to any meaningful 
political change.  End summary. 
 
SPDC Gives Itself a Push 
 
2. (U) Burma\'s ruling State Peace and Development Council 
(SPDC) announced on October 2nd that it would \"reconstitute\" 
the National Convention Convening Work Committee (NCCWC) as 
part of its 7-step \"road map\" to democracy.  The first of 
these steps is the re-convening of the National Convention, 
which was suspended in 1996.  The Committee\'s been staffed 
with 35 members, including three active duty military and 
three ex-military, and a member of the Union Solidarity 
Development Association Central Executive Committee.  There 
were no members of ethnic or other opposition groups named to 
the Committee.  The NCCWC will be chaired by U Aung Toe, the 
country\'s chief justice. 
 
3. (U) The NCCWC was first formed in 1992, but has been 
defunct since the National Convention was suspended in 1996. 
The purpose of the Committee is to offer administrative 
support to National Convention delegates -- such as arranging 
transportation and publishing services. 
 
4. (U) The reformation of the NCCWC comes on the heels of the 
regime\'s naming of 18 members to the National Convention 
Convening Commission (NCCC) -- the body responsible for 
organizing and ultimately re-convening the National 
Convention (see Ref B).  Like the nominees to the NCCWC, the 
initial members of the reinvigorated Convening Commission are 
all affiliated with the regime -- the Chairman is SPDC 
Secretary-2, Lt. General Thein Sein.  However, the NCCWC 
 
SIPDIS 
members, with a few exceptions, are at first blush not 
political hardliners, but senior civil servants in various 
logistical, information, and technical fields. 
 
Comment: Where\'s the Opposition? 
 
5. (SBU) It is discouraging to see the regime steadily march 
toward achieving step one of its democratization plan without 
including of any ethnic or other opposition group members. 
Though this strategy of exclusion may speed up \"progress,\" it 
will scuttle any chance that it might lead to some genuine 
democratic reform.  As reported in Ref A, the major lesson 
from UN Special Envoy\'s recent visit was that the SPDC\'s road 
map could work, but only if both the government and 
opposition participated freely and equally in all stages. 
Unfortunately, Razali felt that the senior SPDC leadership 
had no immediate intention to allow this.  The SPDC\'s 
subsequent naming of a second all-GOB National Convention 
body offers some concrete proof that his assessment is 
correct.

SUBJECT: BURMA HOSTS \"ACCORD\" REGIONAL DRUG TASKFORCE; 
APPEALS FOR MONEY LAUNDERING ASSISTANCE 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: On Oct. 16 Burma hosted the law enforcement 
taskforce of the ASEAN region\'s cooperative counterdrug 
entity, ACCORD.  Members agreed that amphetamines pose the 
biggest drug threat to the region, lauded UNODC 
computer-based training for law enforcement, and demonstrated 
varying degrees of progress on money laundering issues.  For 
its part, Burma uncharacteristically kept the drug meeting 
apolitical but made a last-minute appeal for assistance in 
enacting a mutual legal assistance law, barely two weeks 
before FATF is likely to recommend countermeasures.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) On October 16, the Government of Burma hosted a 
one-day meeting of ACCORD, the \"ASEAN and China Cooperative 
Operations in Response to Dangerous Drugs.\"  The session was 
the second meeting of ACCORD\'s \"third pillar\" (law 
enforcement) since the entity was established in 2000 with 
the objective of pursuing a drug-free ASEAN by the year 2015. 
 In addition to ACCORD members (the ten ASEAN countries and 
China), attendees also included observers from UNODC, 
Interpol, Germany, Australia, Belgium, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Japan, and the United States (Embassy DEA and 
P/E chiefs represented the latter).  The ACCORD meeting 
followed by one day the 24th Meeting of ASEAN Senior 
Officials on Drug Matters (ASOD), also held in Rangoon. 
 
3. (U) Burmese Police Colonel Hkam Aung chaired the 
taskforce, and UNODC and each of the ACCORD members gave 
presentations on progress achieved with the five action steps 
of the law enforcement pillar: law enforcement training, 
precursor control, international cooperation, judicial drug 
control, and money laundering legislation.  UNODC said that 
the U.N. calls ACCORD the \"best counternarcotics plan in the 
world\" and urged members to increase multilateral 
cooperation.  Thailand, represented by General Chartchai 
Suthiklom, Deputy Secretary-General of the Thai Narcotics 
Control Board, gave perhaps the most comprehensive treatment 
of all third pillar issues by any single ACCORD member. 
Brunei also gave a detailed assessment of counterdrug 
actions.  Cambodia\'s presentation, though less sophisticated, 
was notable for its honest assessment of a growing domestic 
drug abuse problem, particularly among school children. 
Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines gave mediocre 
presentations that were neither comprehensive nor 
forward-leaning. 
4. (C) The country presentations varied considerably in their 
quality and, although it was difficult to draw overall 
conclusions from the diverse presentations, several 
region-wide themes emerged.  First, the entire ACCORD 
membership considers the production and trafficking of 
amphetamine-type substances (ATS) to be the fastest-growing, 
and most significant, drug challenge in the region.  Second, 
of the law enforcement pillar\'s five action steps, law 
enforcement training appears to be the most successful. 
Members reported very positively, in particular, on efforts 
to use and implement UNODC computer-based training programs 
(CBT). 
 
5. (C) Finally, the weakest action step, from our 
perspective, is the development of money laundering 
legislation and authorities.  Only a handful of the countries 
could speak definitively on this issue, and several members 
(including China) ignored the topic altogether.  Indonesia 
reported that it is no longer a FATF \"blacklisted\" country, 
but pressed UNODC for more training of police officers on 
financial investigations.  UNODC responded that training is 
available, but with regard to \"blacklisting\" does not support 
the \"unilateral determination\" of whether individual 
countries are cooperating sufficiently on money laundering. 
Indonesia, eliciting laughter from ACCORD members, especially 
the Burmese delegation, urged UNODC to convince FATF to take 
the same approach. 
 
6. (C) Comment: The SPDC, Burma\'s military regime, which 
typically uses rare opportunities to host regional meetings 
as a means to enhance its legitimacy, managed to resist 
hijacking the ACCORD meeting for political objectives.  The 
Burmese police officials who represent Burma at ACCORD were 
professional during this meeting and their military minders 
made only ceremonial appearances.  The Burmese gave accurate 
and positive reports on recent, successful efforts to reduce 
opium production and cultivation.  On money laundering 
issues, however, the Burmese were woefully inaccurate and 
unprepared.  Police Colonel Sit Aye, director for 
international affairs at the Central Committee for Drugs 
Abuse Control (CCDAC), reported that a mutual legal 
assistance law had been drafted and sent to the Ministry of 
Home Affairs on October 13 for ministerial-level review. 
However, he appealed before ACCORD members and observers to 
the UNODC for technical assistance in finalizing the process. 
 When we queried Colonel Sit Aye in a pull-aside whether this 
appeal appeared to be \"too little, too late\" to meet FATF\'s 
November 3 deadline for enacting legislation, he demurred and 
said the matter was out of his hands.

1. (C) Summary:  The SPDC recently arrested a former U.S. 
Embassy FSN and seven university students for distributing 
pamphlets deemed critical of the regime\'s \"roadmap for 
democracy.\"  Additional arrests of NLD supporters indicate a 
continued low tolerance for dissent, and the regime was 
likely emboldened by ASEAN\'s recent endorsement of SPDC 
\"progress\" toward democracy.  We have several reports that 
military intelligence officers are attempting to pressure 
opposition activists into participating in a reconvened 
National Convention.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) According to Embassy sources, SPDC military 
intelligence (MI) agents arrested veteran political activist 
U Win Naing and seven university students o/a September 26 
for distributing leaflets in Rangoon Division that criticized 
Prime Minister Khin Nyunt\'s seven-point \"roadmap for 
democracy.\"  Authorities released U Win Naing, after 9 hours 
of questioning and released five of the students after six 
days of interrogation.  (Note: U Win Naing is a former BBC 
and VOA stringer and, until 1995, worked at the U.S. Embassy 
in Rangoon as an FSN in the political and economic section. 
End note). 
 
3. (SBU) Embassy sources believe that of the seven students 
arrested o/a September 26, two of them, NLD youth members Han 
Win Aung and Myint Myint San, remain detained at Rangoon\'s 
Insein Prison where they risk 7-year sentences under Burma\'s 
\"Printing and Publisher\'s Registration Act of 1962,\" a law 
that prohibits the unauthorized distribution of published 
materials.  The GOB has made no official mention of the 
arrests or subsequent trials; sources only learned of the 
developments from family members of other political prisoners 
at Insein Prison and from the released activists. 
 
4. (C)  U Win Naing told Emboff that MI officers not only 
interrogated him about his political activities and the 
pamphlet distribution, but also questioned him about the 
SPDC\'s reconvening of the National Convention.  The MI 
officers asked him, hypothetically, whether he would attend 
the Convention if invited, noting that he could be invited as 
an individual, not as a member of a political party.  U Win 
Naing responded that with \"modification to procedures\" and 
increased transparency he would consider attending. 
 
5. (SBU) Additional Embassy sources also report that during 
the week of October 13-17, MI authorities detained several 
NLD supporters (NFI) who had participated in a silent protest 
during Aung San Suu Kyi\'s recent surgery and hospital stay 
(reftel). 
 
6. (C) Comment:  With NLD offices shuttered and the party\'s 
entire senior leadership in detention or under house arrest, 
the SPDC\'s low tolerance for political dissent is not 
surprising.  Local democracy activists have very little cover 
for their activities, and ASEAN\'s recent endorsement of the 
SPDC\'s \"progress\" toward democracy gives the regime 
additional confidence to tighten the noose on the dissident 
population.  On October 17, NLD leaders told visiting 
EAP/BCLTV Director that recent NLD detainees had experienced 
interrogation similar to that of U Win Naing.  MI attempts to 
pressure prodemocracy activists into participating in a 
reconvened National Convention provide further evidence that 
the SPDC hopes to select carefully a cast of delegates that 
gives the illusion of broad representation and is primed to 
rubber-stamp a new constitution.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA: PAYING TAXES TO THE DMV 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: In a nightmare bureaucratic scenario that 
unites tax authorities, the department of motor vehicles, and 
military intelligence, as of October 6th the Burmese 
government is using a mandatory annual car registration 
exercise to try and collect desperately needed tax revenue. 
Tax collection has been a serious problem for GOB coffers as 
taxpayer evasion, and tax collector corruption, have 
conspired to keep explicit tax revenues at a minuscule 2-3 
percent of GDP (per the government\'s inflated statistics). 
This new strategy will collect some short-term funds, and may 
punish a few scofflaws.  However, it comes at a bad time 
economically for consumers, further complicates an already 
confusing taxation system, and does little to address the 
serious problem of corruption among tax collectors.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (SBU) A new taxation scheme, focusing on annual motor 
vehicle registration by car owners, got underway on October 
6.  Those registering must prove that they paid income taxes 
on the money they used to purchase the car -- no mean feat in 
a country where paying income taxes often leads to more 
negative government attention than not paying.  If the owner 
cannot provide this evidence, s/he will be assessed on the 
spot a tax of 15 percent of the current market value of the 
car -- as set arbitrarily by Internal Revenue Department 
(IRD) -- not of the original purchase price.  Though 15 
percent is much lower than the normal maximum 50 percent 
income tax rate, in fact the amount of taxes paid will be 
quite high in kyat terms.  Car values have skyrocketed, 
alongside other \"assets,\" due to a weak kyat and rampant 
inflation in recent years.  Thus, ten years ago if someone 
had 400,000 kyat in income to buy a car, s/he would have 
owed, at the highest income tax rate, 200,000 kyat as income 
tax.  The same car now is being valued by the IRD at 10 
million kyat -- a 1.5 million kyat, or $1,700 at current 
exchange rate, tax liability under the new scheme. 
 
3. (SBU) This strategy will punish some tax evaders; however, 
it does little to address other aspects of the revenue 
collection problem -- particularly corruption.  Though 300 
military intelligence officials have purportedly been trained 
to manage this new car tax scheme, these officers will likely 
be only slightly less crooked than the brazenly venal, and 
incompetent, Road Transport Administration Department staff 
that normally oversees car registration and sales tax 
matters.  Anecdotes are rolling in already of payoffs made 
directly to the adjudicating official in exchange for a clean 
bill of health.  We\'ve also heard several complaints that 
everyone, even those who can provide the proper paperwork, is 
being assessed the punitive tax. 
 
4. (SBU) The timing of the move is not ideal.  The Burmese 
economy is scraping bottom, the private banking system has 
collapsed, and there is little formal commerce and nearly 
zero domestic investment.  The government is doing nothing to 
stimulate economic activity or thoughtfully reform the 
troubled tax system.  Adding a new, large burden on the 
country\'s mostly middle class car owners will likely take 
even more kyat out of circulation as people are forced to 
tighten their longyis to pay the new taxes.

REF: A. RANGOON 1313 
     B. RANGOON 1253 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraphs 5 
and 6. 
 
2. (C) For reasons laid out in Ref B, we think it unlikely 
that the Burmese government will produce adequate money 
laundering regulations and a draft mutual legal assistance 
law by the November 3 deadline set by the Financial Action 
Task Force (FATF).  According to FATF, if the deadline passes 
without action, the body will recommend that its members 
impose certain \"countermeasures\" impacting their domestic 
banks\' dealings with Burma. 
 
3. (C) Note: On October 16, during a regional drug task force 
meeting in Rangoon (ACCORD) GOB officials reported that a 
mutual legal assistance law had been drafted and was 
undergoing ministerial-level review (see Ref A).  However, 
officials appealed to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC) for technical assistance in finalizing the process. 
Our observation to the GOB\'s senior money-laundering expert 
that this appeal appeared to be \"too little, too late\" was 
met with stony silence.  End note. 
 
4. (C) We understand that the countermeasure options 
available to the United States come under Section 311 of the 
USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.  Most of the alternatives presented 
in this section would only reinforce the recently imposed ban 
on financial transactions between a U.S. person and Burma, 
and the freezing of assets of Burma\'s state-owned foreign 
trade banks.  However, we think that the Section 311 
sanctions could nonetheless be used to put additional 
pressure on the Burmese economy. 
 
5. (C) Action request 1:  If the Burmese fail to meet FATF 
requirements, we suggest the Department work with the 
Treasury Department to invoke part (b)(2) of Section 311, 
which appears to compel U.S. banks to \"obtain and retain 
information concerning the beneficial ownership of any 
account\" opened by a Burmese person or his/her agent.  This 
requirement would dovetail with section 4(a) of the 2003 
Burma Freedom and Democracy Act, and might help uncover the 
degree to which SPDC members, government and military 
officials, and others close to the regime, have assets inside 
the United States.  This is particularly the case as we\'ve 
heard that high-ranking Burmese officials keeping their money 
in the United States may be doing so using the name of a 
family member or other agent resident in the United States. 
 
6. (C) Action request 2: We further urge State and Treasury 
to push other FATF members -- particularly members of the 
European Union, Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong -- to impose 
their own reporting requirements for Burma transactions. 
Burmese business officials complain that many international 
banks are reluctant now to engage in any transaction with a 
Burmese party, even if such a transaction would not fall 
afoul of U.S. law.  However, some banks -- particularly in 
Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore -- are continuing to legally 
facilitate settlements of international financial 
transactions that include Burma.  New, stricter guidelines 
for transactions with Burma might encourage those banks still 
legally working with Burma to stop.  Likewise, EU 
coordination could be beneficial, as the GOB is encouraging 
businesses to use the euro as a replacement for the U.S. 
dollar.

REF: RANGOON 1314 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In the last few months, the SPDC created 
two new Office of the Chief, Military Intelligence (OCMI) 
special units in Rangoon to focus on monitoring and 
responding to political challenges to the new 7-point 
roadmap.  The offices, Special Unit Number 1 and Special Unit 
Number 2, have authority to arrest, interrogate, and detain 
suspects without notifying the 26 existing Ward-level OCMI 
offices, and may also have a mandate to support the execution 
of the seven-point roadmap to democracy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  U Win Naing, a local political operator briefly 
detained in late September by OCMI (see reftel), told Poloff 
that a few months ago, OCMI opened two new special units in 
northern Rangoon evidently dedicated to handling only the 
most sensitive of political cases.  As proof of this, Naing 
cited how he was arrested and taken not to the local OCMI 
office, one of 26 in the Rangoon area, but to a new OCMI 
office on the north end of Rangoon.  He described it as OCMI 
Rangoon Division #2 Special Unit, and explained that this new 
unit is much more powerful than Rangoon\'s 26 local Township 
OCMI units.  The 26 different township OCMI units and three 
special support units are each commanded by a major.  The two 
new Special Units are each commanded by a lieutenant colonel 
and have three majors as deputies.  After his release later 
that day, U Win Naing was told by his local Township OCMI 
office contact that they had been completely unaware of his 
arrest, questioning, and release until after the fact. 
 
3.  (C) Through his nine-hour questioning by OCMI #2 Special 
Unit was quite civil, Win Naing also said that while on a 
bathroom break he saw two interrogation rooms where the 
prisoners were in handcuffs and blindfolds, and were kept 
standing during their interrogation.  Win Naing also said 
OCMI required him to sign a secrecy agreement regarding his 
questioning, which delayed his reporting the arrests to 
western diplomats and news media for two weeks.  Win Naing 
said he believed the new Special Units were designed to be an 
upgrade of the OCMI. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT:  This is the first time Post has received 
information of these new OCMI Special Units.  The SPDC is not 
tolerating any public opposition regarding the roadmap or any 
other political issue.  However, the SPDC has less control 
over the ethnic leaders, who publicly reject the roadmap and 
a Constitutional Convention unless the democratic opposition 
is fully involved in the process.  It is possible that the 
SPDC created the Special Units to assist in pushing forward 
the seven-point roadmap, by focusing the Units specifically 
on interdicting anti-roadmap activities and by also actively 
pressuring opposition politicians to join in the process.  It 
appears that the new unit was responsible for sounding out U 
Win Naing in his willingness to attending a new 
Constitutional Convention, despite his publicly stated 
opposition of the roadmap in its present form.  If this 
proves to be true, the new OCMI Special Units will become 
very well known to opposition politicians.  END COMMENT.

Classified By: CDA a.i. Ron McMullen For Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) We\'ve been hearing tales of cheating to circumvent new 
U.S. economic sanctions, particularly the ban on importing 
Burmese products into the United States.  Though we don\'t 
have a sense yet of the volume of this malfeasance, it\'s 
becoming clearer that some exporters of garments and seafood, 
unwilling to give up easily, are relabeling their products or 
transshipping them through regional countries to the United 
States.  This is not at all surprising, as the garment 
industry in particular, which relied almost exclusively on 
the U.S. market, has been hit very hard by the new sanctions. 
Though most Burmese seafood goes to Asia and Europe, some 
exporters relied on U.S. sales.  In CY 2002, $27 million 
worth of Burmese seafood was imported into the United States. 
 In CY 2003, $19 million worth had already arrived in the 
United States when the sanctions took effect in late August. 
 
2. (C) Businesspeople with whom we spoke provided second-hand 
accounts of local garment manufacturers keeping a fraction of 
their workforce in place, sewing \"Made in\" China, Korea, or 
Taiwan labels on garments destined for the United States. 
Corroborating this, we\'ve noticed that private shops around 
Rangoon selling \"seconds\" from local garment factories have 
started stocking a peculiar number of items labeled \"Made in 
Korea.\"  As most garments manufactured in Burma are non-quota 
items, it seems strange to relabel locally made products 
except to evade an embargo.  U.S. Embassy officials have also 
unexpectedly been denied access to both Burmese and 
Korean-operated garment factories in recent weeks. 
 
3. (C) On the seafood side, a longtime expatriate seafood 
exporter, who sells exclusively to Europe, told us in 
confidence that many of his less scrupulous colleagues were 
sending their shrimp and fish to Malaysia or Indonesia for 
relabeling and onward shipment to the United States. 
Separately, econoff surreptitiously overheard two boozy local 
businessmen involved in seafood exporting talking about the 
extra expense and difficulties of getting their product to 
the United States using a third country.

SUBJECT: POPPIES, AK-47S, AND WOLFRAMITE: A TRIP TO WA AND 
KOKANG 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: A brief visit to a major opium production 
region in eastern Burma, some of it well outside the writ of 
the Rangoon generals, presented some clear themes.  The 
non-Burman militias and governments that hold sway in the 
eastern border zones govern a region that is far more reliant 
on China than Rangoon for its economic well-being.  Poppies, 
opium, and heroin are on the decline, while amphetamines are 
gaining strength.  The reduction of poppy production is in 
part due to some economic development and crop substitution 
programs.  However, all admitted much more needed to be done 
-- and the international community should help.  The question 
that stuck in our mind, though, is whether the obviously 
wealthy ethnic leaders were doing enough on their own to give 
their people a better, drug-free, life.  End summary. 
 
Where in the World? 
 
2. (U) To publicize its efforts to fight narcotics 
production, and to make the case for more international aid, 
the Burmese counter-narcotics police and military 
intelligence organized a trip for ASEAN, EU, Japanese, and 
U.S. diplomats and police officials into northern Shan State, 
and the otherwise off-limits Special Regions One (Kokang) and 
Two (northern Wa).  Shan State is the largest of Burma\'s 14 
states and divisions, and forms a large \"bubble\" on the 
eastern portion of the country, bordering China, Laos, and 
Thailand.  This particular trip focused on the primary border 
crossing at Muse, along the northern border of Shan State and 
China, before swinging east into the semi-autonomous Special 
Regions on the northeastern Shan-China border.  This rather 
inaccessible area is notorious for insurgent groups, and the 
production of poppies, opium and heroin, and now amphetamines. 
 
3. (U) The Wa and Kokang zones are visitable now because of 
cease-fire agreements the government negotiated in the late 
1980s and 1990s.  In exchange for significant political and 
economic autonomy, the regions were opened up to \"outsiders\" 
-- both Burmans and international organizations -- to assess 
the narcotics situation and try to reduce production and 
trafficking.  Although the Burmese national police and 
military maintain large presences in the two Special Regions, 
both the Wa and Kokang ethnic groups maintain their own 
leadership structure and well-armed militias, and seem to run 
their own local government with minimal interference from the 
central government. 
 
Drugs: Beating Poppies Into Rubber Trees 
 
4. (SBU) Poppy growing and the production and trafficking of 
opium and heroin seem to be on the decline.  A senior Kokang 
leader said his region has been poppy and opium free since 
2002.  Police sources reported that local seizures of heroin 
have been rising steadily since 2001, but that seizures of 
raw opium are down significantly since 2002.   One of the 
most serious challenges now, the police reported, is stopping 
the production and export of amphetamine type substances 
(ATS) and the import of ATS precursor chemicals.  These 
trends track with our own findings, and the findings of the 
joint U.S.-Burma annual opium survey. 
 
5. (U) There was much talk from all sides of the importance 
of crop substitution and other economic development programs 
as antidotes to poppy and ATS production.  The GOB officials 
(police and military) along with the Wa and Kokang ethnic 
representatives all complained that without more 
international support, though, these efforts were doomed to 
failure.  Besides a lack of international aid, local 
officials pointed out other constraints to the success of 
crop substitution: the lack of secure and accessible markets 
for the new cash crops (China has agreed to accept a lot duty 
free, but infrastructure remains a problem); the difficulty 
of finding suitable crops for the local soil and climate for 
which there is also a demand in China; and, the lack of 
adequate motorized transport and good roads to take the new 
crops to market. 
 
6. (SBU)  Despite these constraints, in this corner of Shan 
State there were a number of examples of substitution efforts 
underway.  However, our brief visits to these sites and the 
one-sided presentations we heard made it difficult to assess 
these projects\' significance or success.  Throughout the 
region we saw hillsides once dominated by poppies, but now 
covered in rubber trees, sugar cane, and other cash crops. 
We also saw efforts in the Kokang, Wa, and Burmese zones to 
develop some economic alternatives for farmers; whether it be 
a rubber plantation and factory in Wa, a Japanese 
government-sponsored buckwheat growing program in Kokang, or 
a 1000-acre \"model\" training farm near Lashio, in 
Burmese-controlled northern Shan State. 
7. (SBU) One controversial aspect of the substitution 
programs is the forced relocation of poppy farmers to new 
terrain.  In both Namtik (Wa region) and Laukaing (Kokang 
region), local leaders were proud of recent efforts to move 
600 and 200 households respectively from hillside farming 
areas to lowland areas.  In both cases the leaders said they 
had given housing and farming assistance to the transplants, 
but they gave no details and we had no chance to talk 
directly with the farmers. 
 
Politics: China\'s Burmese Protectorate 
 
8. (U) The dominance, vice influence, of China in the whole 
area was startling.  Particularly in the Wa and Kokang ethnic 
zones, there was very little economic or cultural Burmese 
influence.  Because of difficult terrain and road conditions, 
these areas were far more accessible to China\'s Yunnan 
Province than to the main trade routes inside Burma.  In 
Laukaing (still well inside the Burmese border), kyat was not 
accepted (only PRC yuan), Burmese was not widely spoken, and 
there were no Burmese products in sight. 
 
9. (U) The economic reliance of the region on China is 
pervasive, and indicative of the importance of China to 
Burmese consumers around the country.  As mentioned, the 
success of the crop substitution programs in Wa and Kokang 
rests, in part, on the ability to establish reliable, 
accessible, and untaxed markets on the Chinese side of the 
border.  Even in other regions of Burma, though, the 
consumption of cheap Chinese consumer goods is a way of life 
from Rangoon to the remotest outpost.  An Embassy official 
recently visiting Tamu on the Indian border noted the 
prevalence of Chinese products versus Indian products, 
despite relative proximity of the area to India. 
 
10. (U) The importance of China is not limited to economics 
and trade, though.  During our Shan trip, there was much 
focus on cross-border cooperation for narcotics control. 
Burmese police and military officials credited improved drug 
interdiction cooperation, and some prisoner exchanges, to 
regular consultations with their Chinese counterparts. 
 
Economics: One Word for You...Wolframite 
 
11. (SBU) The level of development in the towns of the Wa and 
Kokang regions, the quality of the ethnic militias\' weapons 
and uniforms, and the newness and quality of the ethnic 
leadership\'s vehicles, indicated diverse and significant 
sources of income that cannot be explained solely by the 
success of the new cash crops.  Much of this is assumed to 
come from narcotics trafficking.  On the legitimate side, the 
Wa leaders mentioned they had local mining concessions 
(producing wolframite and some coal, which was bought by 
China) and some jade claims to the northwest in Kachin State. 
 Wa and Kokang businesspeople are also involved in various 
manufacturing ventures as well as large construction and 
public works projects across the country .  Popular locally 
owned and operated brothels and casinos were widely available 
in the larger towns of the Wa and Kokang regions. 
 
12. (SBU) The main crossing for border trade was in Muse, 
which is connected to Mandalay via Lashio along a very good 
tollway built and operated by Asia World (a company founded 
in the 1990s by a former Kokang leader, and suspected 
narcotrafficker, Lo Hsing-han).  There are at least four 
checkpoints along this route where trucks must stop and be 
searched by Customs officials.  At the checkpoint closest to 
the border, Customs officials say that they check 30-40 
outgoing trucks per day and 35-50 incoming.  Though the 
inspections appeared diligent while the delegation was there, 
Rangoon-based border traders report that the inspection 
process primarily involves paying a pre-arranged fee to the 
chief inspector.  These traders complain that without some 
\"facilitation\" each of the checkpoints can hold up a shipment 
anywhere from one day to one week. 
 
Comment: Meet You Halfway 
 
13. (SBU) It is clear that without more and better economic 
development programs, including crop substitution, it will be 
difficult for dirt poor locals to be enticed away from drug 
production and trafficking.  Although our visit was very 
short, it appears that the local ethnic officials -- who seem 
to be able to spend significant funds on luxury items and the 
development of very modern entertainment facilities -- may 
not be contributing all they should to improving the 
standards of living of their people.  This phenomenon is not 
limited to the Wa and Kokang.  In other areas, such as 
eastern Kachin State, where ethnic cease-fire groups have 
been given lucrative economic autonomy by the government, 
little seems to trickle down to the average person.  This is 
something that should be pondered when considering additional 
international assistance for these regions.

SUBJECT: BURMA: KOREAN FACTORY OWNERS COMPLAIN 
 
 
Classified By: CDA a.i. Ronald K. McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY: Since the U.S. import ban became law on July 
28, 10 of the original 35 Korean-owned garment factories in 
Burma have closed.  The remaining 25 factories are hanging on 
by filling European orders, but are continuing layoffs.  Laid 
off workers have returned to their home towns and villages 
because of a scarcity of jobs in the Rangoon area.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) Two Korean factory owners and the Korean Embassy\'s 
Commercial Attach told EAP/BCLTV Director and Poloff on 
October 22 that of the original 35 Korean-owned garment 
factories and suppliers in Burma, 10 have closed since the 
start of new U.S. sanctions in late July.  The 25 remaining 
factories are relying on orders from Europe to keep their 
production lines open but are still being forced to lay off 
additional workers. 
 
3.  (U) The two factory owners questioned the intended target 
of the U.S. sanctions, complaining that their workers had 
only lost their jobs and could simply return home, while 
foreign investors were the only ones really hurt.  The Korean 
owners said they had lost huge sums of money since the 
sanctions, but they couldn\'t take their capital goods out of 
the country, mainly because the plants are legally owned by 
Burmese front companies that won\'t allow the move. 
 
4.  (U) One of the owners said his factory employed 1,200 
fairly well-educated workers.  Of them, one third could read 
and understand English, and over 200 others were university 
students.  A factory job was appealing to university 
students, as it could bring more social mobility, at $17 to 
$20 a month pay, than any other job a university graduate 
could land.  Once laid off, their workers had to return to 
their home village as there were not many other options for 
employment in the Rangoon area.  The owners said they were 
not aware of former workers being forced into the sex trade, 
and they thought this outcome was unlikely. 
 
5.  (C) In an ironic twist, one of the remaining Korean 
factories was trying to expand its production line but 
couldn\'t because of difficulty hiring laid off workers.  The 
workers wouldn\'t take the new jobs because of the expensive 
daily commute to the new factory on the other side of town. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  The Korean owners\' complaint about being 
the target of sanctions is sour grapes.  The BCLTV Director 
pointed out to the two owners that they knew it was risky to 
invest in Burma, and that import ban legislation had been 
discussed for years.  Interestingly, the Koreans admitted 
that about 100 Chinese, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese-owned 
garment factories were able to close down, pack up, and ship 
out all their plant equipment just before sanctions took 
effect, primarily because they had not created Burmese front 
companies when setting up operations in Burma.  The Korean 
decision to go with a Burmese front company seemed more 
advantageous during start up, but now proves to be a major 
mistake when trying to flee the country.  As for workers and 
the sex trade, this is another source that supports the view 
that laid-off garment factory workers have returned to their 
villages or have sought other, albeit scarce, jobs in other 
sectors and have not yet made the sex trade their number one 
choice for follow-on employment.  That said, Rangoon does in 
fact have a large enough sex industry, as well as 
entertainment industry, to absorb workers laid off from the 
garment factories.

SUBJECT: VIEW FROM A RANGOON STREET KIDS SHELTER 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: On October 21 the director of an NGO-funded 
Rangoon street kids drop-in shelter reported an absence of 
GOB impressment for portering and forced enlistment of street 
children compared to previous years.  The shelter director 
believes the U.S. sanctions have increased local unemployment 
as Rangoon-area companies are unable to pay for imported raw 
materials and must layoff workers.  However, she claimed the 
closing of garment factories has not resulted in an increase 
of street kids. END SUMMARY. 
 
REACHING OUT TO STREET ORPHANS 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  On October 21 visiting EAP/BCLTV Director and Poloff 
toured an NGO-funded street kids drop-in shelter in Rangoon. 
World Vision established the shelter in 1997, with the 
mission to protect street children from abuse and educate 
them on health and hygiene.  The center provides a place to 
stay for up to three years for about 10 girls and 40 boys who 
are street orphans or whose parent(s) are living on the 
streets themselves.  The shelter\'s outreach program provides 
much needed nutritional and medical care to children 
suffering from malnutrition and other diseases associated 
with poverty. Through word-of-mouth, the shelter attracts a 
small fraction of the estimated thousands of children living 
on the streets of Rangoon.  Freedom to come and go during the 
day is very appealing and allows some kids to find light work 
in the nearby market to earn pocket money.  One of the 
Center\'s goals is to informally educate the street kids, who 
have never attended state schools, by giving them an 
equivalent to the GOB\'s minimum standard of a fourth-level 
education. 
 
NO MORE FORCED PORTERING? 
------------------------- 
 
3.  The Shelter director and three teenage residents reported 
that they haven\'t heard of any cases in the past two years in 
which street kids were press ganged in Rangoon for military 
portering duties.  Forced military recruiting has taken a 
different turn as well.  The Army recruiters still corral 
underage teens to get them to join the military, but now 
those who don\'t want to join are released.  Recently, two 
underage teens from the shelter were taken to join the army, 
but one said \"no thanks\" and was allowed to return to the 
shelter.  The other, described as a difficult youth, was not 
let go. 
 
UNEMPLOYMENT UP 
--------------- 
 
4.  The shelter director claimed that sanctions have 
increased local area unemployment because factories could not 
pay for needed import materials and were forced to layoff 
workers.   However, there have not been any children of 
garment factory workers turning up at the shelter. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  This is the first report received of a 
cessation in street children being forced into military 
portering.  It is also the first time post has heard that 
army \"recruiters\" are giving underage teens the option to say 
\"no\" to a recruitment pitch.

SUBJECT: RELIGIOUS/ETHNIC TENSIONS SPREAD TO RANGOON 
 
Classified By: CDA a.i. Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: For the past four nights, October 25-28, and 
coinciding with the advent of the holy month of Ramadan, 
Rangoon has experienced low-scale religious violence between 
Muslims and Buddhists that originally flared up in 
mid-October in upper Burma.  The motives for these attacks, 
their instigators, and allegations of government involvement 
remain hazy.  Religious conflict is not new in Burma, and 
there is a long history of tension between the Buddhist 
majority and the local \"Indian\" community, a growing, 
religiously diverse population of South Asians that 
encompasses most of Burma\'s several million Muslims. 
However, religious and ethnic violence is rare in the capital 
city and the Muslim community is apprehensive about further 
attacks.  The regime has take firm action, deploying riot 
police and troops that have minimized injuries and property 
damage.  However, religious and ethnic tensions are 
significant and underscore general political and economic 
discontent throughout Burma.  End summary. 
 
Religious Conflict Comes to Rangoon 
 
2. (C) According to eyewitness accounts, on four consecutive 
nights October 25-28, Buddhist monks and other \"unruly\" 
civilians have attacked mosques, shops, and homes in several 
of Rangoon\'s four major Indian/Muslim quarters.  Muslim 
youths have responded with rock throwing and several injuries 
have been reported.  Embassy officers visited the Muslim 
quarters and observed some broken windows and minor 
destruction of cars and storefronts.  Local residents report 
that government authorities have deployed riot police and 
army troops into the affected neighborhoods to secure the 
areas and to lead early morning clean-up operations, leaving 
very little evidence of the violent confrontations.  The GOB 
has reportedly instituted an indefinite 7:00 pm curfew on 
monasteries in the Rangoon area, but has not made any public 
acknowledgment of the skirmishes. 
 
3. (C) The Rangoon incidents come on the tail of several 
violent Buddhist-Muslim confrontations on October 11-12 and 
19-20 in two towns near Mandalay.  A representative of a 
Islamic organization in Rangoon told us that these two 
incidents claimed nine lives and led to the destruction of 
two mosques and several homes.  The representative said he 
thought the clashes emanated from a personal business dispute 
and then spread along religious lines.  He blamed local 
authorities for doing nothing initially to prevent the 
conflict from spreading. 
 
4. (C) According to local contacts, a large troop and police 
presence in the Mandalay area initially prevented the 
mid-October disturbances from spreading directly into Burma\'s 
second largest city.  However, according to sketchy reports, 
authorities arrested a prominent Buddhist monk on October 28 
for delivering anti-Muslim sermons and troops were 
subsequently dispatched to quell a violent 
counter-demonstration led by several hundred monks at a 
Mandalay monastery. 
 
The Government Responds:  No Problem 
 
5. (C) Following the mid-October skirmishes in the Mandalay 
area, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs convoked ambassadors 
from six Muslim countries and the Ministry of Religious 
Affairs summoned leaders of Burma\'s four main Muslim groups 
to brief them on developments.  According to our diplomatic 
colleagues, the GOB downplayed the violence and gave 
assurances that the government had full control of the 
situation.  The Pakistan DCM told us on October 28 that the 
Muslim diplomatic corps planned to deliver a joint demarche 
before the end of the week expressing deep concern over the 
latest attacks and skirmishes in Rangoon.  He said that the 
tight-knit South Asian and Muslim communities were 
apprehensive about further violence.  He added his own view 
that religious tensions were an annual occurrence in Burma, 
coinciding with various religious holidays, but that violence 
in Rangoon was rare. 
 
6. (C) On October 28, the Minister of Religious Affairs gave 
Muslim leaders an additional briefing and claimed that the 
attacks near Mandalay and in Rangoon had been the work of 
\"underground cells of political opposition groups\" hoping to 
embarrass Burma during the APEC Summit and various ASEAN 
meetings.  The Minister detailed government actions to date, 
including the detention of the anti-Muslim monk in Mandalay 
and the arrest of 43 monks involved in the Rangoon attacks, 
and promised that the GOB would do all it could to prevent 
further religious violence.  However, the Minister urged the 
Muslim leaders to take care of themselves and their 
communities, avoiding any provocation or acts of revenge. 
One Muslim leader told us that local government officials had 
separately threatened to arrest any Muslim calling the 
faithful to prayer via loudspeaker or undertaking any other 
publicly \"provocative\" act.  Muslim leaders tell us they will 
do what they can, but add that they cannot stop their 
followers from \"defending themselves or their homes.\" 
 
History Often Repeats 
 
7. (C) Small-scale religious violence in Burma is unusual, 
especially in Rangoon, but hardly unprecedented.  There was a 
small skirmish between Buddhists and Muslims in a town about 
150 miles south of Mandalay in July and a larger incident 
occurred in 2000 in Pyay, about 200 miles northwest of 
Rangoon.  There is also a long history, tracing back to the 
British colonial era, of mutual mistrust and dislike between 
the predominately Buddhist Burman majority and the minority 
Muslim, Hindu, and Christian Burmese citizens of Indian 
origin.  In fact, the South Asian community was until late in 
the colonial period the majority ethnic group in Rangoon, 
outnumbering native Burmans.  It is a common belief, though 
unsubstantiated, that the government itself often provokes 
these Buddhist-Muslim clashes to divert people\'s attention 
from food shortages or other economic and political problems. 
 
Comment: Who\'s to Blame? 
 
8. (C) The complicated nature of inter-religious relations in 
Burma makes motive for these latest disturbances hard to 
grasp.  Muslim leaders in Rangoon reject the GOB\'s claims of 
sinister political \"destructionists\" and assert that the 
attacks were too well organized to be anything but 
government-sponsored.  We have no solid proof that the GOB or 
one of its instruments were involved, though, and it seems 
illogical to inflame traditional tensions in the heart of the 
capital city. 
 
9. (C) The Mandalay and Rangoon flare ups, provoked by the 
SPDC or not, are likely fueled this year by overlapping major 
Buddhist and Muslim holidays.  During this period, hotheads 
of both religions are at the peak of chauvinism; identifying 
themselves most powerfully as Buddhists or Muslims -- rather 
than Burmese citizens all suffering together under the same 
yoke.  Though it appears the regime is taking steps to ensure 
these tensions remain in hand, an increasingly large Muslim 
community in Rangoon may be less likely than in the past to 
take religious violence lying down.

SUMMARY 
--------- 
 
1. (C) Summary: Chinese Ambassador to Burma Li Jinjun posited 
in a late October meeting that current efforts by the 
international community on Burma should be aimed at 
establishing a platform for stable cooperation between Aung 
San Suu Kyi (ASSK) and the SPDC.  The U.S. should consider 
lifting economic sanctions, at least partially, and work with 
China to identify concrete areas for cooperation between ASSK 
and the SPDC.  ASSK should seek to de-emphasize her role as 
leader of the Burmese democratic and human rights movement 
and take steps to portray herself as a statesperson willing 
to grapple with economic development issues.  The May 30th 
attack on Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters was an almost 
inevitable outcome of a poorly managed process after ASSK\'s 
release in 2002 from house arrest.  It is only a matter of 
time before ASSK is released from her current detention, 
although the SPDC will not take any action that could be 
perceived as being the result of outside pressure, the 
Chinese Ambassador concluded.  End Summary. 
 
What a difference a year makes 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) In an October 22 meeting with Chinese Ambassador Li 
Jinjun, EAP/BCLTV Director Judith Strotz noted that the 
situation in Burma had changed significantly and for the 
worse since her meeting with Ambassador Li the year before; 
that the result had negative implications not only for 
stability within Burma but for the region as a whole; and 
that the U.S. remained concerned about indications that Burma 
was seeking to obtain a nuclear reactor from Russia and 
weapons from North Korea. 
 
3. (C) Ambassador Li stated that the international community 
sometimes had the view that China was happy with the SPDC; 
this was not the case.  He continued that he had not been 
surprised by the May 30th attack on National League for 
Democracy (NLD) leader Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK), commenting 
that the initial response to ASSK\'s release from house arrest 
in May 2002 from all parties, including the international 
community, had been overly optimistic and ignored that ASSK 
and the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) were only 
in the initial stages of confidence-building.  In addition, 
ASSK had insufficient opportunities to engage in dialogue 
with the SPDC, a problem that was compounded by the failure 
of ASSK, the SPDC, and the international community to 
formulate a concrete plan of action.  As a result, ASSK\'s 
increased freedom, the activities she and the NLD pursued, 
and the SPDC\'s response to them, rather than building 
confidence, created doubt and disappointment on both sides. 
 
4. (C) Continued and increased pressure by the United States, 
Japan, the European Union (EU), and ASEAN for ASSK\'s 
immediate release will be counterproductive as the SPDC will 
not take any action that could be perceived as being the 
result of outside pressure, Ambassador Li said.  In addition, 
by focusing only on ASSK\'s release, the international 
community runs the risk of creating a situation that will 
lead to a repeat of the May 30th attack.  ASSK\'s release 
should not be a precondition for lifting sanctions or 
returning to dialogue, argued Ambassador Li.  Rather ASSK, 
the SPDC, and the international community should aim at 
establishing a stable platform of cooperation between ASSK 
and the SPDC, an approach that UN Special Envoy Razali 
supports.  Thus, the United States, the United Kingdom, and 
other EU countries that support ASSK must not ignore recent 
steps taken by the SPDC, including the assignment of General 
Khin Nyunt as Prime Minister and the recently announced road 
map.  Criticism will only shut down prospects for progress, 
Ambassador Li stated.  A better option is the tack being 
taken by ASEAN, which provides Burma with space to come up 
with its own solution. 
 
ASSK:  Democracy Fighter or Stateswoman? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) According to Li, now that the SPDC has announced the 
road map, the ball is in ASSK\'s court.  Her apparent lack of 
response to the road map--which Ambassador Li said it is in 
her best interest to support--gives the impression that the 
SPDC has the upper hand.  It is positive, however, that ASSK 
has said that she is pleased with Khin Nyunt\'s selection as 
Prime Minister, Ambassador Li noted.  ASSK should be wary of 
sticking too tightly to her principles, as should the SPDC, 
if there is to be progress.  ASSK should de-emphasize her 
role as leader of the Burmese democratic and human rights 
movement and take steps to portray herself as a statesperson 
willing to grapple with economic development issues.  He 
suggested that ASSK could join the SPDC on a commission to 
review international aid projects.  In response to Strotz\'s 
comment that the SPDC had turned down this suggestion from 
Razali, the Ambassador said that initially Razali saw his 
mandate as promoting political reform; however, he now 
believed that work also needed to be done on economic issues, 
implying that a future suggestion might have a more positive 
response.  SPDC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe regards 
ASSK as a member of the military family, but a rebellious one 
who has been influenced negatively by external influences, 
according to Ambassador Li.  Strotz noted that a number of 
military family members had met unhappy ends, including 
former leaders Tin Oo and Ne Win. 
 
6 (C) Although China has continued to adhere to its policy of 
non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign 
countries post-May 30th, China has approached the SPDC on 
issues such as economic growth, social stability, and the 
welfare of the Burmese people in an effort to help the SPDC 
deal with those issues more effectively.  While China can\'t 
claim to have a great deal of influence with the SPDC, these 
measures have had some impact, Ambassador Li assessed.  It is 
not enough to persuade the SPDC, however.  The U.S. might 
want to use its influence to persuade ASSK to take some kind 
of action, Ambassador Li suggested. 
 
Have you met with Aung San Suu Kyi? 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Strotz commented that there are areas of commonality 
in the U.S. and Chinese understanding of Burma.  She agreed 
that the U.S. and the international community need to look 
beyond ASSK\'s release in order to avoid a repeat of the 
events of the past year.  Strotz also noted that the U.S. 
deliberately had not criticized the road map, suggesting only 
that it should include ASSK, the NLD, and the ethnics groups 
and that it would be useful to have some sort of timeline. 
 
8. (C) Strotz added that the U.S. had a more positive view of 
ASSK\'s role.  The release of ASSK was a priority.  The USG 
could not engage ASSK if we continued to be denied access to 
her.  ASSK needed information from multiple sources in order 
to be able to respond to the current situation.  Since this 
information was being withheld from her, ASSK likely did not 
have sufficient data to assess the current situation. 
Responding to Director Strotz\'s question concerning whether 
Ambassador Li would consider meeting ASSK, Ambassador Li 
acknowledged that ASSK was an important person and that the 
NLD was an important political force in Burma.  However, it 
would not be prudent for him to meet with ASSK at this time, 
as doing so would have a negative impact on his ability to 
meet with the \"top three\" senior SPDC officials, said 
Ambassador Li.  He added that they share their \"inner 
thoughts\" with him. 
 
Support the Road Map 
-------------------- 
 
9. (C) Ambassador Li indicated he was pleased to learn that 
the U.S. has not publicly criticized the road map, although 
U.S. comments on the need for a timeline and inclusion of the 
NLD were not necessarily helpful.  Urging more public U.S. 
support of the road map, Ambassador Li suggested that perhaps 
the U.S. could go further and show a positive response, 
partially lifting sanctions.  Then, the SPDC will resume 
confidence-building initiatives with ASSK, although not 
necessarily dialogue, as both sides still are skeptical of 
one another, offered Ambassador Li.  The SPDC and ASSK must 
engage in concrete, substantive cooperation in specific 
fields to establish a firm foundation for further dialogue. 
China and the U.S. should work to foster cooperation between 
the SPDC and ASSK.  China is doing what it should and hopes 
that the U.S. will as well, Ambassador Li said in closing. 
 
10. (SBU) Strotz noted that the U.S. believed the SPDC 
responded positively to pressure but, when it felt it had 
leeway, it took negative actions.  The sanctions conveyed a 
clear message to the SPDC and we hoped that they would help 
bring about positive change. 
 
Comment:  Chicken or Egg? 
------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Ambassador Li\'s approach this time was quite 
different from that of a year ago.  He continued to urge 
engagement with the regime and argue against exerting 
pressure on Burmese leaders.  However, he was much clearer on 
China\'s displeasure with the SPDC and on the steps China had 
taken to influence the situation, while continuing to mouth 
support for non-interference in internal affairs.  Also, he 
was much more forthright on the need for ASSK to play a role 
in the future of Burma. End Comment.

conditions, thanks to the education and dedication of the 
doctor and the support of MSF-Holland.  It provides a glimpse 
of the terrible health conditions faced by the vast majority

2.  (U) On October 21 EAP/BCLTV Director and Poloff toured an 
MSF-Holland HIV/AIDS clinic in the Hlaing Thaya Township 
slums located in a swamp across the river west of Rangoon. 
The GOB established this township following the 1988 uprising 
with the aim of resettling troublemakers to an inhospitable 
area.  At each of their three Rangoon-area HIV/AIDS clinics, 
MSF-Holland also runs a Maternal and Child Care program, a 
nutrition program, and a counseling service for people living 
with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The nutrition program feeds about 40 
to 60 malnourished children and about a dozen acute care 
adults a day. Besides malnutrition, the clinic\'s patients 
commonly suffer from TB, diarrhea, STDs, and HIV/AIDS.  The 
Maternal and Child Care program has registered 54,000 
patients since it opened in August 1994, and provides 
prenatal care, family planning, STD treatment, STD 
counseling, commercial sex worker treatment and counseling, 
Males who have Sex with Males (MSM) and male STD care, and 
HIV/AIDS care and support to about 100 patients a day.  The 
clinic\'s Burmese director, Dr. Myiet, also noted that the 
clinic had seen cases of cholera.

3. (U) The clinic\'s director related how the GOB made it 
illegal for foreigners to test for HIV/AIDS. Only government 
labs can do so.  However, if a GOB clinic or lab does the 
test, confidentiality is not provided.  As a work-around, NGO 
clinics will draw a blood sample, assign a random 
identification number, and then send the sample to the GOB 
clinic or lab to be tested.  Patient confidentiality is 
thereby maintained. 
4.  (U) Another problem related to confidentiality is 
involuntary HIV/AIDS testing.  Government hospitals and 
medical clinics routinely test suspect patients for HIV/AIDS 
without the patient\'s knowledge or permission.  If they test 
positive, the GOB clinic merely informs the unsuspecting 
individual, then leaves them to cope on their own with the 
aftermath.  MSF-Holland has developed a special counseling 
service in their Hliang Thaya Township HIV/AIDS clinics to 
help these new PLWHAs adjust to the shock of being HIV 
positive, how to prevent transmission to others, and help 
them develop a family support plan. 
 
ART 
--- 
 
5.  (U) In April this year, MSF-Holland implemented a 
three-drug-cocktail Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) drug 
therapy program with the target of supporting 100 PLWHAs in 
Hliang Thaya Township.  ART is exponentially higher in cost 
than any other drug therapy, such as treatment for malaria. 
To prevent GOB clinics from packing the program with 
relatively wealthy, well-connected patients who can bribe 
their way into treatment, the MSF-Holland clinic mutually 
decides with the referring GOB clinic who actually enters the 
program.  MSF-Holland also requires that candidate patients 
for the program must already reside in the Hliang Thaya 
Township slum. 
 
NO INCREASE IN SEX WORKERS 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) Following the implementation of the U.S. import ban, 
the clinic director, Dr. Myeit, had expected an increase in 
new sex workers showing up at the clinic for treatment and 
counseling.  However, she admitted she had not yet seen any 
sex workers who had previously worked in a garment factory. 
 
7.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The clinic director, not unlike some NGOs 
based in Thailand, had since July expected to see an influx 
of new ex-garment factory workers enter the sex trade.  This 
shows that the GOB\'s anti-U.S. sanctions propaganda campaign 
has been quite successful by claiming that the U.S. was 
forcing garment factory workers into the sex industry. 
However, according to the clinic director\'s finding, this 
does not seem to be happening yet on any noticeable scale. 
On the contrary, according to two Korean factory owners who 
have recently fired most of their workers (reftel), the women 
have returned to their home villages or, for the few who 
could afford to stay in Rangoon, are pursuing legitimate 
jobs. 
 
8.  (SBU) The MSF-Holland clinics provide the only medical 
support for Hlaing Thaya Township, and it is very evident 
that humanitarian NGOs operating just in Rangoon alone are 
saving thousands of Burmese children and adults each year 
from preventable extreme malnutrition and from TB, STD, or 
AIDS-related deaths.  But it is only a drop in the bucket. 
The humanitarian situation outside the reach of the few NGO 
clinics is a very different story.  END COMMENT. 
 
9.  (U) This message was cleared by EAP/BCLTV Director Judith 
Strotz.

SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The Japanese Ambassador to Burma, Yuji 
Miyamoto, is urging U.N. Special Envoy Razali to conduct his 
dialogue efforts \"in secret\" and to replace his pro-ASSK 
liaison officer in Rangoon, two points the Japanese believe 
might lead the SPDC to be more cooperative.  The Japanese 
also want Razali to establish an office in Rangoon in support 
of his efforts.  Meanwhile, the Japanese Embassy in Rangoon 
is keen to smooth feathers of SPDC generals who are miffed 
over PM Koizumi\'s public criticism of Burma at the ASEAN Bali 
Summit.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Japanese Embassy political counselor Ichiro Maruyama 
told us on October 29 that his Ambassador, Yuji Miyamoto, had 
departed on a brief mission to Kuala Lumpur to meet with U.N. 
Special Envoy Razali.  According to the political counselor, 
Ambassador Miyamoto planned to encourage Razali to continue 
his efforts aimed at achieving a political dialogue between 
the SPDC and ASSK, but to conduct his dialogue efforts 
\"quietly, if not secretly.\"  Maruyama said that the SPDC 
trusted Razali, but would never respond positively to his 
\"arrogant\" public diplomacy and high-profile visits. 
 
3. (C) Counselor Maruyama also said his Ambassador would tell 
Razali that the SPDC has lost total faith in Leon de 
Riedmatten, the former ICRC chief who serves as Razali\'s 
liaison in Rangoon.  According to the Japanese Embassy, in 
the aftermath of the May 30 attack the SPDC believes that de 
Riedmatten is too close to ASSK and cannot represent the 
neutrality required of a U.N. envoy.  The Japanese Ambassador 
was also prepared to appeal to Razali to establish an office 
in Rangoon that would allow the U.N. envoy to be better 
prepared and informed for his infrequent visits to Burma. 
 
4. (C) Maruyama was quick to point out that Ambassador 
Miyamoto was not a \"messenger\" for the SPDC in reaching out 
to Razali.  However, he acknowledged that regime contacts had 
intimated to the Japanese Embassy that it would be \"helpful 
if Razali was made aware\" he needed to dump de Riedmatten and 
to be more discreet in his handling of dialogue efforts. 
Maruyama added that the idea for Razali to establish a 
permanent office in Rangoon was hatched by the Japanese 
Embassy, but that the SPDC was receptive to the concept. 
 
5. (C) Counselor Maruyama also noted that Japan would be 
hosting an ASEAN Summit in December to commemorate 30 years 
of Japan-ASEAN cooperation.  He said that his Embassy was 
\"worried\" that Burmese Prime Minister Khin Nyunt would not 
attend the summit due to SPDC ire over Japanese PM Koizumi\'s 
public airing in Bali of concerns regarding Burma.  As a 
result, the Japanese Embassy will advocate to headquarters in 
Tokyo that the GOJ refrain from criticizing Burma for the 
next month or so and send the Japanese Foreign Minister or 
Deputy Foreign Minister to Rangoon in November to 
hand-deliver an invitation to PM Khin Nyunt for the December 
summit. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  The Japanese tell us here that they believe 
Razali has little hope of succeeding with his dialogue 
efforts.  However, they support the U.N. process and want to 
keep Razali engaged for lack of better alternatives. 
Contrary to assertions that Ambassador Miyamoto is not a 
\"messenger\" for the SPDC, the Japanese here continue to 
maintain close contacts with military intelligence and seem 
inclined to push Razali in a direction that might elicit 
better cooperation from the regime.  The Japanese believe 
that they played a helpful role in supporting secret talks in 
1993 that secured a presence in Rahkine State for the UNHCR 
(using their influence with then-High Commissioner Ogata), 
and would like Razali to take the same approach.  As for 
efforts to get PM Khin Nyunt to attend the Japan-ASEAN 
Summit, the Japanese Embassy in Rangoon is known for its 
pro-engagement stance, often getting ahead of the Japanese 
MOFA on Burma policy.  Counselor Maruyama did not respond to 
our observation that PM Koizumi\'s remarks in Bali regarding 
Burma were right on the mark.  End Summary.

1.  (S) Russian Ambassador Oleg Kabanov told EAP/BCLTV 
Director Judith Strotz and DCM October 22 that Russia\'s 
proposal to sell a nuclear research reactor to Burma was 
\"basically frozen,\" adding that Burmese students are in 
Russia studying (at Burmese expense) nuclear engineering and 
technology.  Kabanov said he raised the potential reactor 
deal with senior GOB officials twice in the last eighteen 
months and was told both times, \"we\'ll get back to you.\" 
Kabanov indicated Russia was eager and willing to conclude a 
sales deal, and professed that if the deal were to go 
forward, all IAEA standards and safeguards would apply.  All 
this tracks closely with Embassy Moscow\'s October 22 
discussion with Minatom, reftel.  When asked if some third 
country could possibly have concluded a sales agreement with 
Burma in the meantime and perhaps even begun construction, 
Kabanov said he didn\'t know. (Note: media, embassy, and 
other-source reporting suggests that construction on some 
sort of nuclear facility may have already begun.  These 
reports are yet to be verified.  End Note) 
 
2. (S) Director Strotz reiterated USG concern regarding 
reports of Burma\'s unregulated nuclear aspirations in light 
of Burmese interest in acquiring weapons from North Korea. 
 
3. (C) The Russian ambassador also said Russian mechanics 
maintain the Burmese Air Force MIG-29s under the terms of an 
after-sales service contract.  He said no Russians fly the 
MIGs, they only maintain them.  \"I am happy to report that so 
far none of them have crashed,\" he said with a grin.  When 
the contract is up, the aircraft technicians depart, the 
ambassador stated, unless the contract is renewed or extended.

ADDRESS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: U.N. human rights envoy Pinheiro has kicked 
off an ambitious week in Burma during which he hopes to 
secure: the release of ASSK and all NLD members detained 
since the May 30 attack; an agreement to conduct an 
assessment of the attack; the reopening of political party 
offices; amnesty for all remaining political prisoners; and 
movement on an assessment mission on the military rapes in 
Shan State.  Pinheiro is frustrated by the \"linguistic 
contortions\" of a government that has been uncooperative and 
by a regime that is responsible for a particularly egregious 
year of human rights abuses.  Nonetheless, the human rights 
envoy is determined to press ahead.  We admire his tenacity, 
but there are no signs the regime intends to make any 
concessions in the short term.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) UNCHR Human Rights Special Rapporteur Paulo Sergio 
Pinheiro called on the Chief of Mission on November 3 at the 
beginning of a week-long mission to Burma.  Pinheiro\'s 
current visit to Burma is his first since he cut short an 
investigative mission in March upon discovering an electronic 
listening device during a \"confidential\" interview with a 
political prisoner.  Pinheiro was accompanied by two 
Geneva-based UNCHR Associate Human Rights Officers, Hulan 
Tsedev and Federila Donati. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
3. (C) Pinheiro said that he had hoped to make a longer visit 
to Burma in order to collect appropriate information for his 
next report to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, due on 
November 12.  Despite the short window of opportunity 
provided by the regime, the human rights envoy said he had a 
full schedule that included meetings with Prime Minister 
General Khin Nyunt, Minister of Home Affairs Col. Tin Hlaing, 
SPDC Secretary-2 Lt-Gen Thein Sein, and Deputy Foreign 
Minister U Khin Maung Win.  Pinheiro said he would visit 
political prisoners and had also requested meetings with Aung 
San Suu Kyi (ASSK) and other members of the NLD Central 
Executive Committee under house arrest in Rangoon.  (Note: 
Pinheiro will probably not see U Tin Oo, who is imprisoned in 
remote Sagaing Division, or U Lwin, whom the SPDC allowed to 
travel to Mandalay on October 31 to see his dying son, who 
passed away on November 1.  End note). 
 
4. (C) Pinheiro said that during his past missions to Burma 
he had been frustrated by \"ritual\" meetings with the GOB that 
lacked any real substance.  As a result, for his current 
visit he had provided the GOB with advance talking points 
which he hoped would generate a genuine dialogue, if not 
concessions on the part of the regime.  His ambitious goals 
for the current mission include: the immediate release of all 
those arrested or deprived of liberty in connection with the 
May 30 incident; an agreement on his proposal to conduct an 
assessment of the May 30 attack; the opening and reopening of 
all political party offices; consideration of the modalities 
for the amnesty of all remaining political prisoners; an 
agreement on the modalities and the timing of a Shan State 
(military rapes) assessment; and for the regime to reaffirm 
its commitment to establish a National Human Rights 
Institution according to the Paris Principles. 
 
5. (C) The human rights envoy said he was also extremely 
frustrated by the regime\'s inability to offer any compromises 
or to implement any of his many recommendations.  \"I can\'t 
continue like this,\" said Pinheiro, adding that he had 
previously recommended to the regime, without success, the 
immediate and unconditional release of all political 
prisoners, a cessation of arbitrary arrests, the lifting of 
restrictions on the political parties, and various 
legislative and judicial reforms.  He said the regime\'s 
description of ASSK\'s five-month prison detention and house 
arrest as \"protective custody\" was simply another example of 
\"linguistic contortions\" that underscored the SPDC\'s 
inability to adopt international norms with regard to human 
rights. 
 
6. (C) In response to Pinheiro\'s inquiry about USG 
expectations, we said that new sanctions were indicative of 
U.S. sentiment toward the regime.  Although Washington might 
publicly welcome the release of ASSK and the rest of the NLD 
leadership, the U.S. would continue to press hard for the 
release of all political prisoners and would, absent concrete 
steps toward a transition to democracy, maintain sanctions. 
We also shared with Pinheiro and his delegation our views on 
the current human rights situation, drawing the U.N. team\'s 
attention to forced participation in USDA mass rallies to 
support the regime\'s \"roadmap to democracy;\" pressure on 
civil servants and citizens to join newly created people\'s 
militia; and the arrest and detention of NLD supporters who 
provided logistical support for ASSK\'s 2002-2003 upcountry 
travels.  We provided Pinheiro with a sanitized report of the 
May 30 attack and photographs of the attack site and injuries 
sustained by eye-witnesses. 
 
7. (C) Comment: Pinheiro, though frustrated, expressed 
determination to fulfill his mandate and undertake all 
possible measures to improve Burma\'s deplorable human rights 
situation.  He admitted that it has been a \"very bad year\" 
for human rights abuses and he was visibly moved when he 
described his encounters with victims and eye-witnesses to 
the May 30 premeditated assault on ASSK and her convoy.  We 
are supportive of his creative approach in giving the GOB 
something to chew on before he meets with senior officials 
this week.  However, we do not expect the regime to be very 
forthcoming on any of his fundamental objectives.  End 
comment.

5 to clarify his ambassador\'s position regarding Swiss 
citizen Leon de Riedmatten, Razali advisor and head of

2.  (C) Kawamura stated that his Ambassador, Yuji Miyamoto, 
had not demarched or suggested to Razali in their October 27 
meeting in Kuala Lumpur that de Riedmatten be removed as 
Razali\'s facilitator or advisor, nor would he make such a 
suggestion in the future.  The Japanese DCM said that Razali 
heard directly from the GOB that it has lost confidence in de 
Riedmatten, adding that the Japanese embassy had heard the 
same thing from the GOB.  Kawamura added that de Riedmatten, 
seen by the SPDC as being too close to Aung San Suu Kyi, has 
lost his heretofore excellent access to ASSK and senior 
regime leaders. 
 
3.  (C) Comment: The Japanese DCM said he was providing the 
above clarification on specific instructions from his 
ambassador.  Could be that reftels prompted Tokyo to once 
again rein in the Japanese ambassador, an avid advocate of 
engagement with the SPDC, who has been way out ahead of Tokyo 
several times over the past year. 
 
4.  (C) Comment, Continued:  Prior to May 30, de Riedmatten 
was just as close to ASSK as he is now (but then had regular 
access).  Further, Khin Nyunt agreed on May 28 to allow Leon 
to function as ILO ombudsman for labor issues and abuses, 
indicating a high degree of trust in de Riedmatten for this 
sensitive position.  What has happened since then is not that 
Leon de Riedmatten has changed, but that the SPDC regime has 
been bolstered by what it sees as a vote of confidence from 
ASEAN and continued high-level courting from India and China. 
 It has decided to bull its way forward with its self-imposed 
solution while ignoring input from anyone else.  End Comment.

SUBJECT:  EVEN THE DEAD ARE OPPRESSED 
 
 
1.    SUMMARY:  The Burmese junta on November 1 ordered the 
demolition of a large Christian cemetery in a Karen 
neighborhood of Rangoon.  Graves not exhumed by family 
members of the deceased by December 2 will be bulldozed, as 
the regime plans to build a condominium on the site.  Emboff 
witnessed the macabre scene of scores of families grimly 
exhuming the bodies of loved ones during a visit to the 
cemetery.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Sawbwagyigone cemetery, located in Insein 
Township, is a large, 100-year old cemetery containing the 
graves of over 5,000 people, mostly Karen and Shan 
Christians.  It is reportedly the largest Christian cemetery 
within Rangoon\'s city limits.  After the November 1 All 
Souls Day ceremony, the community was told by the Yangon 
Peace and Development Council about government plans to 
build a condo on the site and the December 2 deadline for 
removing the graves. 
 
3.  Emboff visited the cemetery with an FSN November 6. 
Scores of families were busy breaking open the graves of 
their relatives.  A typical grave includes a two-foot high 
brick and concrete structure over a coffin buried just below 
ground level.  Some people carried black garbage sacks to 
gather remains from decomposed coffins.  More recently 
buried coffins were being taken away intact.  Many Christian 
ministers were there with distraught families to offer 
prayers and solace.  The FSN showed Emboff the graves of his 
mother and sister and discussed his family\'s plans to dig up 
and move their remains.  A neighboring grave had already 
been exhumed, but for some reason the bare skull was left 
sitting on the remaining above-ground structure. 
 
4.  Municipal authorities told families the government would 
provide ground for re-burial in a distant, undeveloped area. 
One family member said, \"but what if they want to use that 
land in five years; won\'t we just have to move the graves 
again?\"  A Karen doctor has reportedly offered to buy the 
cemetery land from the GOB to prevent a condo from being 
built there, even though the cemetery must go.  The 
community backs this proposal, as the doctor would build a 
Karen cultural center there that could honor the memories of 
the twice departed. 
 
5.  Insein Township is populated largely by members of the 
Karen ethnic minority.  Emboff talked with an elderly Karen 
women at the cemetery who said she was 9 years old during 
the Karen uprising of 1949 and remembers government aircraft 
bombing Insein - at that time a Karen rebel stronghold.  She 
said her 16 year old brother died fighting the Burmese 
government in the revolt, another was still MIA, and that 
her cousin had been captured and imprisoned for years.  Many 
cars and vans of families gathered for the exhumations 
sported Karen flag bumper stickers or window decals. 
 
6.  The regime in 2000 ordered the obliteration of a Chinese 
Buddhist cemetery three miles down the road.  Today a still- 
unfinished garish municipal hall occupies that site.  Muslim 
and other cemeteries within the city limits have suffered 
similar fates. 
 
7.  COMMENT:  The families exhuming the remains of their 
loved ones were grim and forlorn, but Emboff heard no 
rumblings of outrage or dissent.  One wonders what it would 
take for the downtrodden, docile citizenry of Burma to mount 
even a symbolic protest.  Perhaps the old woman, who lost 
much of her family in 1949, feels she and her family have 
already paid too high a price for acting on their political 
convictions.  End Comment.

Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s private garment manufacturers claim 
100 closed factories and 50,000 jobless as of the end of 
October -- with another 25,000 likely out of work by year\'s 
end.  However, last-minute, limited garment orders from 
Europe will postpone the death of the Burmese garment 
industry into 2004.  As of yet, there\'s still no overwhelming 
evidence of large numbers of garment workers turning economic 
migrant or karaoke hostess.  However we will wait until 
severance packages and other opportunities dry up before 
making a firm assessment of the social cost of the garment 
sector\'s demise.  End summary. 
 
Burma\'s Garment Makers Emerge from Woodwork 
 
2. (C) Citing increased attention from military intelligence, 
Burmese owners of private garment factories have refused to 
meet us since the implementation of the U.S. import ban in 
late August.  This import ban cut off the industry\'s primary 
market for clothing -- worth around US$ 70 million to the 
Burmese economy in 2002.  However, we were able to sit down 
on November 5th with a representative of one of the largest 
private firms, a regular and reliable pre-sanctions contact 
of the Embassy\'s, to hear the Burmese view of the state of 
affairs in the garment sector.  Several Korean investors in 
the garment sector recently aired their grievances to us as 
reported in reftel. 
 
3. (C) The Burmese factory owner told us that an unexpected 
20 percent rise in orders from Europe (due to the Euro 2004 
soccer tournament), had softened the landing for his factory, 
and those of his colleagues.  Nonetheless, he had already 
closed two of his seven factories, with a loss of 1,000 jobs, 
and will close another this month -- 500 more jobs.  Through 
the end of October, the loosely organized Burmese garment 
manufacturers\' association reported 100 factories closed with 
a loss of about 50,000 jobs.  He commented that the damage 
was almost done, predicting another 50 factories and 25,000 
jobs lost in the next two months before capacity and demand 
returned to equilibrium.  He feared, though, that there would 
be another round of closures in 2004, when the limited Euro 
2004 orders dried up. 
 
The Mystery of the Laid-Off Garment Worker 
 
4. (C) Our contact agreed with his Korean colleagues\' 
assessment that few laid-off workers (nearly all young women) 
had thus far sought refuge in the entertainment industry or 
headed for the Thai border.  Instead, he thought, most had 
unsucessfully sought work in other stricken garment houses, 
before heading back to the fields of their home villages. 
However, he warned that it was really too early to make any 
firm statements on the ultimate fate of these people.  By 
law, factory owners are required to give each laid-off 
employee a three-month severance package.  When these 
packages start to dry up, in a month or two, the economic 
situation for these unemployed, and their families, could 
become dire.  He would not speculate on the ultimate 
destination for his ex-workers.  He said that the 
entertainment industry was \"not for everybody,\" however, he 
also asserted that employment opportunities for young women 
are extremely limited. 
 
5. (C) What is clear for now is that the government will 
offer little assistance.  Adopting the attitude it has relied 
upon when faced by troubled traders and bankers, the Minister 
of Industry (1) told a group of the largest local garment 
factory owners that they should surivive \"the best you can on 
your own.\"  When pressed, the Minister offered that 
government factories might be able to temporarily hire 5-10 
percent of the unemployed garment workers, but at a wage far 
lower than in the private factories.  (Government wages 
across the board are pitiful, with a civil servant at the top 
of the wage scale earning 10,000 kyat (about US$11 at current 
rates) per month.  Private garment factories usually offer 
around the equivalent of US$15-$20 per month, or more, plus 
overtime.) 
Grim Future, But Details Aren\'t Clear 
6. (C) From our observations and recent discussions with 
garment manufacturers, NGOs, and other businesspeople 
(including some potential hirers of ex-workers) we reach two 
conclusions: (1) U.S. sanctions are expediting the death of 
an already sickly garment sector and new orders from Europe, 
or elsewhere, will not arrive to save the day; and, (2) it\'s 
too early to make absolutly definitive assertions on the fate 
of all of the 50,000-100,000 workers who have already lost, 
or who will likely lose, their garment jobs.  No one claims 
that there are revolving doors between the garment factories 
and the Thai border, or the restaurants, karaoke lounges, 
massage parlors, and discos of Burma\'s cities.  However, with

1. (C) SUMMARY:  Additional information on the May 30 Depeyin 
attack continues to emerge from victims and eyewitnesses, 
providing new context and clarity to the regime\'s true role 
in the premeditated assault on ASSK and the NLD.  On November 
4, NLD members smuggled to us video footage of Aung San Suu 
Kyi (ASSK) and the NLD convoy, taken in the days and hours 
preceding the attack, which portrays the phenomenal support 
the NLD leader enjoys in Burma\'s hinterland as well as clear 
evidence of the aggressive position authorities took against 
her convoy.  New testimony obtained in late October from 
three wounded survivors also underscores the regime\'s direct 
role in facilitating the attack, which resulted in the 
political killings of at least 6 NLD members, an unknown 
number of supporters, and perhaps as many as 70 members of 
the convoy\'s self-appointed security escort of motorcycle 
outriders.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Video Evidence: The Eve of the May 30 Attack 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C)  On November 4, NLD supporters at the behest of ASSK 
smuggled a videotape to the U.S. Embassy, requesting that it 
be delivered to UN Human Rights Special Rapporteur Pinheiro. 
The one-hour tape, filmed by NLD cameramen, documents the 
final four days of ASSK\'s swing through northern Burma and 
ends the night of May 29, just 24 hours before the deadly May 
30 attack on the NLD convoy.  Juxtaposed against footage of 
many thousands of cheering villagers and townspeople, who 
gathered to welcome ASSK and listen to her speeches, are 
numerous shots of government security forces and USDA 
\"protesters\" who grew in numbers over the course of the trip 
to harass the passing NLD convoy. 
 
3. (C) In one scene on the video, government-sponsored 
protesters half-heartedly waved anti-NLD signs; however, 
local villagers berated the protesters and pulled down their 
signs, prompting USDA minders to rush in and prod the 
protesters to keep in line.  In one small village, the camera 
records a large group of protesters who suddenly drop their 
anti-NLD signs, rush across the road to join NLD supporters, 
and spontaneously join in singing the Burmese National Anthem 
as a sign of support for the convoy.  Further footage 
portrays USDA thugs increasingly angry and abusive as the 
convoy made its way through small towns and villages on the 
planned return trip to Rangoon. 
 
4. (C) The videotape also shows footage of government 
security forces maintaining a constant presence along the 
convoy route and at village stops, including military 
intelligence and police vans, trucks, motorcycles, and jeeps 
littering rural roadsides.  By the time the NLD convoy 
reached Myin Mu in Sagaing Division during mid-day on May 29, 
the USDA had dramatically increased its numbers and added 
several packed tour buses, light trucks, and sedans to its 
own parallel convoy.  As ASSK and her delegation reached the 
outskirts of Monywa, the last major town on the route before 
the attack in Depeyin, hundreds of young motorcycle riders 
joined the NLD\'s twelve-vehicle convoy to act as a buffer 
against the USDA convoy.  Finally, as the NLD convoy entered 
Monywa that evening, authorities cut off the town\'s 
electricity.  The final scene of the tape shows a massive, 
candle-lit crowd of thousands welcoming the NLD convoy into 
an eerily darkened downtown Monywa. 
 
5. (C)  The Embassy showed the tape with accompanying 
translation to visiting UN Human Rights Special Rapporteur 
Paulo Pinheiro on November 6 during his visit to Rangoon. 
Pinheiro was taken aback by the huge size of the crowds 
turning out in every town and village through which the NLD 
convoy passed.  He had previously been under the impression 
that the NLD delegation was being greeted at every stop by 
masses of anti-NLD protesters and that very few locals were 
supporting the NLD.  He felt strongly that this tape should 
be shown to ASEAN leaders, who to this point don\'t believe 
ASSK has any popularity left in Burma.  He advised that 
Razali should see the tape and use it in further briefings 
with ASEAN.  Pinheiro will see that international television 
media outlets receive a copy of the tape when he leaves Burma. 
 
Survivors: Witnesses to the Blood Bath 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) On October 30, three survivors of the May 30 attack 
secretly traveled to Rangoon to give their eyewitness 
 
SIPDIS 
accounts to Embassy officers.  All three showed us permanent 
wounds from the attack, including scars, punctures, and 
broken bones.  The three survivors, NLD members based in 
Mandalay, were in the first and third cars immediately behind 
ASSK\'s vehicle during the attack on May 30.  Their testimony 
picks up the story from where the videotape ends.  At dusk on 
May 30, ASSK, eleven additional NLD cars, a truck full of 
pro-NLD monks, and hundreds of volunteer pro-NLD security 
\"outriders\" left Monywa and arrived at Kyi village.  Earlier 
in the day, ASSK, apparently aware of the increasingly 
aggressive posture of the USDA and local authorities, had 
ordered her entire delegation to use passive resistance if 
attacked. 
 
7. (C) As the convoy passed through Kyi village, a local monk 
ran up and asked ASSK if she would address the villagers, 
adding that they had been waiting for her all day.  NLD Vice 
Chairman U Tin Oo, in the lead car, pulled over to wait about 
30 yards further down the road.  At that moment, a column of 
USDA buses, trucks, and sedans that had tailed the NLD convoy 
for the previous three hours stopped and unloaded.  Hundreds, 
possibly thousands, of USDA members armed with bamboo staves, 
sharpened wooden stakes, and slingshots began attacking 
villagers and motorcycle outriders at the rear of the convoy. 
 The villagers fought back, trying to seize weapons from the 
USDA attackers.  Some members of the NLD convoy stepped out 
of their cars and could see the melee illuminated by 
headlights from trucks in the rear.  After five minutes, the 
USDA attackers began attacking the NLD convoy itself, 
advancing forward on both sides of the road firing bicycle 
spokes from the slingshots and using their weapons to beat 
the occupants of each successive NLD car. 
 
8. (C) According to one of the eyewitnesses, Kin Maung Thaun, 
NLD Mandalay Division Executive Member and a passenger in the 
third car behind ASSK\'s vehicle, was hit several times in the 
head by a USDA youth who pleaded with him, \"Uncle, please lie 
down and pretend you are dead; I was told to kill you.\"  Kin 
Maung Thaun slumped down as instructed, while the attackers, 
always aiming at the head, badly beat four women and killed 
two other men in his car.  Before the USDA reached the lead 
car, eight of ASSK\'s bodyguards surrounded her but were 
either beaten to the ground or were forced off into nearby 
rice paddies.  The wounded driver from Kin Maung Thaun\'s car 
saw the USDA smash ASSK\'s windshield, so he ran forward to 
help protect her.  The USDA beat him, breaking his right arm, 
and pierced him above the eye with a bicycle spoke.  When the 
driver fell down, the attackers wrenched his broken arm and 
continued beating him for 10 minutes.  Thirty minutes into 
the attack, ASSK\'s own driver, with ASSK still unscathed but 
now unprotected, sped her away from the attack scene and to 
the next village (Note: ASSK was then detained by local 
authorities.  End note). 
 
9. (C) After ASSK safely escaped the scene, USDA attackers 
shifted from beating and killing to looting the NLD vehicles. 
 Two hours after the attack began, a USDA leader blew a 
whistle that sounded retreat to the attackers and waiting 
buses.  Kin Maung Thaun, the NLD Mandalay official, then 
climbed out of his car and saw three dead NLD members in the 
car behind his.  He then hid with three other NLD men in a 
rice paddy about 80 yards from the head of the NLD convoy. 
Around 11:30 PM, about 1.5 hours after the USDA mob had left, 
military and riot police forces arrived and began to clean up 
the attack site, washing down the road and arranging the NLD 
vehicles to look as if they had been in accidents.  Riot 
police used their shields to bring sand to cover the diesel 
and blood stains on the road surface.  Kin Maung Thaun then 
watched them use a blanket to load at least fifteen severely 
wounded and dead onto a waiting truck.  Around 3:00 AM on May 
31, a group of high level officials arrived from Monywa, 
slowly passed alongside the destroyed NLD convoy, and left 
the scene. 
 
Comment:  A Well-Planned Attack 
------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) The new video and eyewitness testimony provides more 
clarity on the methodology the regime used to attack and shut 
down the NLD in May.  As the NLD\'s trip progressed through 
Mandalay and Sagaing Divisions, and as ASSK drew larger and 
larger crowds even in the face of ever-stiffer government and 
USDA intimidation, the regime tried increasingly hostile and 
aggressive tactics with the hopes of dissuading the NLD from 
continuing.  This in turn generated more support for the NLD 
in each town and village, and eventually led to hundreds of 
NLD supporters on motorcycles joining to provide security 
from the growing USDA menace.  Faced with the huge 
candlelight reception in Monywa on May 29th, held in the face 
of more government and USDA intimidation, the regime then 
chose not to risk attacking the NLD in a public area, and 
instead safely attacked in a remote village on a desolate 
stretch of road where very little civil population was 
available to rise up and come to her defense. 
 
11. (C) The USDA youth telling the older NLD member to 
\"pretend you are dead, uncle,\" because he was ordered to kill 
him, is compelling evidence that the regime, through its 
agents in the USDA, ordered these people killed for political 
reasons.  This conclusion is further supported by the 
government security forces being continuously present 
throughout the entire trip up to Monywa after which they 
suddenly disappeared.  The regime held back its security 
forces so the USDA could attack and destroy the NLD convoy, 
kill supporters, neutralize NLD leadership, and leave the 
government with plausible deniability.  We have provided 
Pinheiro with both the video tape and pictures of the wounded 
survivors so he will have a fuller understanding of the 
context surrounding the May 30 human attack.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  Pinheiro summarized to COM on November 6 
that his present visit was a bust and he sees regression in 
the human rights situation since his last trip to Burma.  The 
SPDC did not concede to him any of the outcomes he\'d hoped 
for during this visit, including releasing the May 30 
prisoners, reopening political offices, allowing an 
assessment of the Shan State rapes, and agreeing to an 
assessment of the May 30 attack.  Though he found ASSK in 
good health and in a very good mood when he met her earlier 
on November 6, he also found her isolated and out of touch 
with the political situation.  He felt that the NLD \"uncles\" 
are under \"illusions\" of having influence they don\'t possess 
with their assessment that the roadmap is a \"fake\" and will 
be overturned at the UNSC.  ASSK is open to having visitors, 
but will not herself initiate any requests for such to the 
SPDC.  She feels the regime treats her courteously; however, 
before any dialogue or compromise she still insists the GOB 
or the UN must conduct a credible assessment of the May 30 
attack.  In a meeting with PM Gen Khin Nyunt, Pinheiro heard 
a clear intent by the regime to unilaterally execute their 
roadmap for democracy.  Pinheiro is leaving for Bangkok on 
Saturday, November 8 after briefing the Rangoon press and 
diplomatic corps.  He will fly to New York on November 11 to 
make his report to the United Nations on the 12th.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
AN ISOLATED ASSK 
 
2.  (C)  On the evening of November 6, UN Special Rapporteur 
for Human Rights, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, joined UNDP Res Rep 
Charles Petrie, former ICRC head Leon de Reidmatten, and the 
British Ambassador at the COM\'s residence to review a newly 
acquired videotape of ASSK\'s last few days on the road before 
the Depeyin attack (reftel A).  After the viewing, Pinheiro 
recounted his meeting with ASSK a few hours earlier in the 
afternoon, and said he found her to be in good health, 
lively, and full of humor.  He said it is \"scary\" that ASSK 
is so isolated and he believes her confinement is not good 
for her grasp of political realities. 
 
3.  (C) When Pinheiro asked her if she would initiate 
requests to have visitors, ASSK specifically stated that she 
will not do so.  According to UNDP\'s Petrie, who joined 
Pinheiro in his meeting with ASSK, the NLD leader wants to 
avoid any special treatment not afforded to her detained NLD 
colleagues.  Though she will meet with anyone who requests 
and succeeds in getting SPDC authorization for a visit, she 
will not initiate any requests on her own.  ASSK added that 
she would be angry with Pinheiro if he does not comply with 
her wishes on this issue, a position with which the Special 
Rapporteur told COM he disagreed. 
 
4.  (C) At the request of U Tin Oo\'s wife, Pinheiro had asked 
the Minister of Home Affairs to move U Tin Oo from his 
isolated prison in northern Burma and bring him back to 
Rangoon and under house arrest where he would be safer. 
However, ASSK rejected this too, saying that there should be 
no special treatment for NLD prisoners until all were 
released. 
 
5.  (C) Pinheiro related how ASSK portrayed firm control and 
conviction in her political position.  She said she had won 
several important \"victories\" since Depeyin, including her 
dictating to the SPDC the decision and the timing for her 
recent surgery, and her telling the SPDC she would not return 
to Insein Prison but would go into house arrest instead.  She 
told Pinheiro she is very pleased with the recently expanded 
U.S. sanctions on the regime.  She also feels that the SPDC 
treats her courteously, singling out Brig Gen Than Tun for 
special praise as being a gentleman and easy to negotiate 
with.  She admitted that she had made a \"mutually agreed 
security arrangement\" with the SPDC, as stated recently in 
the press by Brig Gen Than Tun, but asked Pinheiro not to 
question the regime about it as it might prove embarrassing 
to them. 
6.  (C) When asked what she thought about the SPDC roadmap, 
ASSK simply said that \"it doesn\'t exist\" and that the SPDC 
has no right to develop a roadmap.  She said the only 
possible roadmap is one that is negotiated between the SPDC 
and NLD.  Regarding Depeyin, ASSK still insists the GOB or 
the UN conduct a credible investigation or assessment. 
According to Pinheiro, she said she doesn\'t want a pound of 
flesh, she just wants people held accountable for the deaths. 
 ASSK pointed out that there are hard-liners and there are 
the less-hardliners, but that the international community 
doesn\'t want to weaken the hand of the moderates by pressing 
too hard on the investigation.  She also said she is ready 
for dialogue and compromise, but not until the regime tells 
everything about what happened at Depeyin. 
 
\"UNCLES UNDER ILLUSION\" 
 
7.  (C) Pinheiro met with NLD Central Executive Committee 
members Aung Shwe, Nyunt Wei, and with the oldest of the 
\"uncles,\" Lun Tin.  He characterized the uncles as being 
completely isolated.  Though they have no visitors and no 
phones, they do receive some newspapers and are somewhat 
informed about the current political situation.  However, 
they are under an \"illusion\" that they are very powerful 
within Burma, and that pressure will come from the UNSC, or 
in the form of a \"Foreign Ministers\' Troika.\"  As further 
proof of their isolation, Pinheiro cited how they told him 
the SPDC roadmap was a \"fake,\" that it will be discussed in 
the Security Council, and then will finally be decided by 
negotiation between the SPDC and the NLD. 
 
SPDC REGRESSION 
 
8.  (C) From his meetings with the Minister of Home Affairs, 
the Foreign and Deputy Foreign Ministers, and the Prime 
Minister, Pinheiro concluded the SPDC showed no signs of 
interest in consultation or dialogue with ASSK, but will 
consult with the ethnic groups.  Pinheiro advised the regime 
leaders that the Depeyin attack presented both a \"regression 
and an opportunity,\" and that this can be the moment of 
healing and forward movement.  Khin Nyunt pointed to the 
extensive mass rallies around the country as proof that the 
people support the roadmap.  The Minister of Home Affairs 
told Pinheiro he didn\'t like Pinheiro\'s proposed methodology 
for the Shan State rape investigation.  Brig Gen Than Tun 
told Pinheiro a Shan rapes assessment would be very 
\"intrusive.\" 
 
9.  (C) COMMENT:  Pinheiro, as his latest visit drew near to 
a close, seemed dissatisfied and displeased with the lack of 
progress on his mandate.  He was also concerned about the 
growing isolation of ASSK and the CEC.  While the SPDC moves 
forward with its forced-march down the road to its version of 
democracy, there are fears that ASSK will still be under 
house arrest and the NLD totally neutralized when the forced 
march is completed.  END COMMENT.

1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Pinheiro gave a downbeat assessment to the 
diplomatic corps of his visit this week to Burma. He repeated 
most of his themes from his November 6 meeting at the COM\'s 
residence (reftel), and he was obviously restraining himself 
from showing his true level of frustration with the regime. 
Pinheiro privately told the COM that he will give a much 
harsher critique of his visit when he reaches Bangkok.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Regarding the SPDC\'s total failure to grant any of his 
goals on this visit, UN Special Rapporteur of the Commission 
on Human Rights, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, very carefully 
announced to the well represented Rangoon diplomatic corps 
that the SPDC \"did not refuse\" his six appeals.  He related 
how he told the SPDC that they cannot count on his seal of 
approval in the UN without including civil and political 
rights in their roadmap process, and that his credibility 
will disappear unless they make significant prisoner 
releases.  Pinheiro said he had warned the SPDC that he will 
have to pursue his Shan rapes investigation externally if 
they don\'t cooperate with him, and that it will be the SPDC\'s 
fault if it happens that way. 
 
3.  (C) Pinheiro confirmed that 136 NLD members had been 
arrested since May 30, and that of those 101 had been 
released and 35 were still being held.  He also confirmed 
that Aung San Suu Kyi was not being held under any provision 
of the security laws, though inexplicably the eight elderly 
CEC members are. 
 
4.  (C) Regarding the roadmap, Pinheiro said he\'d told the 
SPDC he is not a facilitator for the political process, but 
the authorities can\'t have political success without the 
inclusion of basic political freedoms.  After all of his 
meetings with the SPDC and Government ministers, he concluded 
that for the SPDC, the 1990 elections \"are completely off the 
radar.\"  Though Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt told 
Pinheiro that the NLD can join in one of the eight groups of 
\"farmer\'s,\" \"worker\'s,\" and \"politician\'s\" delegates that 
will participate in the National Convention, Pinheiro told 
the diplomats that there is apparently no inclusion of the 
NLD in the process. 
 
5.  (C)  Finally, Pinheiro announced that he proposed to the 
authorities that they should release immediately, by November 
12 at the latest, the 35 remaining May 30 NLD prisoners as 
well as the 8 CEC members under house arrest, since \"they 
pose no danger to you.\"  He also had told the authorities he 
had a clear picture of the events surrounding Depeyin and 
that he will mention it in his speech at the UN.  (Note: A 
strong hint regarding the NLD video, digital pictures, and 
survivor testimonies provided by the Embassy.  See reftel). 
End note.)  He closed by saying he hoped the \"roadmap\" didn\'t 
become a \"roadblock\" like in other parts of the world.  If 
the SPDC \"wants to play, then OK.\"  But, in Pinheiro\'s 
opinion, they have to implement basic human rights into the 
process or it won\'t work.

1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Former ICRC Head and assistant to UN 
Special Envoy Razali, Leon de Reidmatten, briefed COM on his 
November 7 Bangkok meeting with Thai Foreign Minister 
Surakiat. De Reidmatten said that from the discussion that 
took place between SE Razali and FM Surakiat, it is clear the 
SPDC aim is to have an elected government in place by 2006, 
the year of the ASEAN summit in Rangoon.  SE Razali\'s 
position is that sanctions don\'t work, engagement doesn\'t 
work, so now it is time for the UN to be more active by 
putting forward a \"plan\" similar to the SPDC road map.  It is 
becoming ever more clear that the SPDC had an end state, and 
an end date, in mind when they announced the road map back in 
August - the end state is a sitting \"elected\" government, and 
the end date is the ASEAN Summit 2006. De Reidmatten 
expressed alarm at ASSK\'s continued isolation - coupled with 
the regime\'s increasing confidence in the aftermath of the 
Bali summit. Observations from both de Reidmatten and UNSR 
Pinheiro (Ref A) underscore the need for more pressure on the 
regime to include the opposition in the road map - pressure 
that must be exerted by ASEAN countries (Thailand, Indonesia, 
Malysia), India, China, and Japan, in conjunction with 
ongoing UN efforts. END SUMMARY. 
 
Special Envoy Razali meets with FM Surakiat 
 
2.  (C) Leon de Reidmatten, former ICRC Head of Delegation to 
Burma and currently the Assistant to UN Special Envoy Razali, 
told the COM that in the November 7 meeting with SE Razali 
and the Thai Foreign Minister, SE Razali was told that the 
Thais are concerned that Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD will be 
left out of the whole political process now unfolding in 
Burma.  De Reidmatten said the Thais have discussed the 
Burmese roadmap with Khin Nyunt, but that the Thais are not 
very clear on \"what the road map really means,\" that Than 
Shwe wants to pursue the road map without any detours, and 
that PM Khin Nyunt and General Maung Aye think it is 
important to include the opposition in the process, but \"not 
at any cost.\"  De Reidmatten said that from the discussion 
that took place between SE Razali and FM Surakiat, it is 
clear the SPDC aim is to have an elected government in place 
by 2006, the year of the ASEAN summit in Rangoon. De 
Reidmatten said that SE Razali\'s  position is that sanctions 
don\'t work, engagement doesn\'t work, so now it is time for 
the UN to be more active by putting forward a \"plan\" similar 
to the SPDC road map. 
 
3.  (C) Reidmatten said that Thai DepPermSec Virasakdi 
Futakul told him during the meeting (and later at dinner on 
November 7) that at the December 10-11 ASEAN summit in Tokyo, 
PM Khin Nyunt will answer ASEAN\'s questions on the SPDC\'s 
road map and will explain the implementation plan. De 
Reidmatten said Futrakul thinks the SPDC will then relax 
their restrictions on the NLD and will release Aung San Suu 
Kyi from confinement. 
 
 
Pinheiro Visit to Rangoon 
 
4.  (C) De Reidmatten described Pinheiro\'s latest visit to 
Rangoon (Nov. 3-8) as a chance for the SPDC to test the 
waters and find out how much it can get away with by not 
improving human rights and keeping the NLD locked up and out 
of the political process. In de Reidmatten\'s opinion, the 
SPDC didn\'t give Pinheiro anything on this visit (refs A and 
B), and the SPDC is waiting for the world\'s reaction to 
Pinheiro\'s speech to the UN on November 12 to see if it can 
keep plowing straight ahead with their road map.  De 
Reidmatten thinks the SPDC hasn\'t quite decided how to go 
about taking the next step in the road map, but it is 
definitely getting bolder about moving forward without the 
NLD. 
 
ASSK in Isolation 
 
5. (C) Echoing SR Pinheiro\'s observations (see ref A) 
Reidmatten expressed great concern at how ASSK is being 
\"isolated\" and increasingly left out of the political process 
in Burma.  Reidmatten commented that \"the NLD has to come 
back to reality\" and realize the SPDC is moving ahead without 
it.  He was concerned, just like SR Pinheiro, that ASSK and 
the NLD \"uncles\" were being unrealistic in thinking that 
their refusal to accept the possibility of participating in a 
road map developed by the SPDC was a show of strength that 
would be supported by UNSC action. De Reidmatten pointed out 
to COM that in order to have an elected government in place 
in 2006, the SPDC will have to hold elections in 2005.  That 
requires a referendum on the constitution in 2004.  So there 
will have to be a constitutional convention in early 2004, 
probably January. De Reidmatten said he was so worried about 
the momentum the SPDC was gathering that he would try to 
convince ASSK to write a letter directly to Gen. Than Shwe 
stating that the NLD was willing, and should be allowed  to 
participate in the road map.  De Reidmatten said that unless 
ASSK and the NLD are more realistic re the need for 
participation in the political process NOW, he feared ASSK 
and the \"uncles\" would be released to face an new 
constitution and an elected government that excluded them 
completely. 
 
6.  C) COMMENT: It is becoming ever more clear that the SPDC 
had an end state, and an end date, in mind when they 
announced the road map back in August - the end state is a 
sitting \"elected\" government, and the end date is the ASEAN 
Summit 2006. Pinheiro and de Reidmatten\'s emphasis on ASSK 
and the NLD\'s increasing isolation, coupled with the regime\'s 
increasing confidence in the aftermath of the Bali summit, 
underscores the need for continuing pressure on the regime to 
include the opposition  - pressure that must be exerted by 
ASEAN countries (Thailand, Indonesia) and India, China, and 
Japan in conjunction with ongoing UN efforts.

SUBJECT: GOB RELEASES EIGHT MAY 30 POLITICAL PRISONERS 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The GOB announced on November 10 the release 
of eight political detainees, including six known members of 
the NLD arrested following the May 30 premeditated attack on 
ASSK and her convoy.  The releases are clearly calculated to 
soften the blow of a damning U.N. report on the human rights 
situation in Burma to be delivered to the UNGA on November 
12.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) On November 10, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
announced the release of eight Burmese democracy activists 
detained since the May 30 attack in Depeyin on Aung San Suu 
Kyi (ASSK) and her NLD convoy.  In what has become standard 
practice for the GOB, the MFA made the announcement in a 
release to all diplomatic missions in Rangoon, except the 
U.S. Embassy. 
 
3. (U) The MFA provided minimal information on the detainees, 
stating that \"with regard to the events of the night of May 
30, it is learnt that 8 more persons were released and sent 
home on 9th November 2003.\"  However, in contrast to recent 
releases of political detainees, the GOB did provide a list 
of detainee names and their prison locations.  Authorities 
released four of the detainees from Shwebo and Khamti jails 
in Sagaing Division, two from the Myitkyina jail in Kachin 
State, and two from Insein jail in Rangoon, the latter being 
Burma\'s most notorious prison for political dissidents. 
 
4. (C) Contrary to international press reports, not all of 
the released detainees appear to be members of the NLD party. 
 Embassy NLD sources are unable to verify that the two 
detainees released in Myitkyina, Daw Ngwe Kyaing (female) and 
Tin Soe, are regular members of the party and neither of the 
two appear on lists of activists missing since the May 30 
assault. 
 
5. (C) Six of the released detainees, however, are well known 
NLD members.  They include Tun Zaw Zaw, Aung Soe, Hla Oo, 
Teza Naing, Daw May Hnin Kyi (female), and U Hla Min.  The 
most prominent of the six are Tun Zaw Zaw, an NLD youth 
leader who was partially blinded during a previous stint in 
jail, and U Hla Min, an NLD Member of Parliament-elect from 
Thaninthayi Division and a participant in a U.S. Embassy 
public diplomacy democracy program.  Both of the two NLD 
members are considered close confidants of ASSK and \"second 
generation\" leaders of the NLD movement. 
 
6. (C) Three of the released NLD members were arrested in 
connection to their direct participation in the ill-fated NLD 
convoy, including Hla Oo, Teza Naing, and Aung Soe.  Local 
police and military intelligence officials arrested the three 
en masse on May 31 near Depeyin, the day after the attack. 
The other released NLD members were arrested during a 
nationwide SPDC-led sweep that shut down the entire NLD party 
structure in the aftermath of the May 30 attack.  Among those 
arrested during the sweep were U Hla Min and May Hnin Kyi, 
who were both detained in June and then re-arrested in July 
for alleged parole violations.  May Hnin Kyi, also an NLD 
MP-elect, was originally detained with eight other NLD women 
in Mandalay for writing a letter to SPDC Chairman Senior 
General Than Shwe calling for ASSK\'s immediate release. 
 
7. (C) Comment: The release of eight political detainees is 
welcome news.  However, this decision by the SPDC is clearly 
calculated to soften the blow of U.N. human rights envoy 
Pinheiro\'s expected report to the UNGA on November 12.  The 
regime made no substantive concessions to the rest of 
Pinheiro\'s numerous requests on the human rights front and 
continues to detain dozens of NLD members and some 1,300 
political prisoners.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  Indian Vice President Shekhawat\'s November 
2-5 visit to Burma was the most senior mission by an Indian 
leader in 16 years and the latest in a string of high-profile 
visits from India and other neighboring countries.  The 
Burmese regime pulled out all the stops for the visit, though 
concrete results were limited.  However, from a public 
relations perspective, the SPDC scored a major victory and 
demonstrated its ability to draw in regional leaders who are 
keen to pursue bilateral objectives, but willing to overlook 
Burma\'s deplorable political situation.  Notably absent from 
Shekhawat\'s proceedings was a human rights agenda and 
anything more than a passing reference to democratization. 
End Summary. 
 
A \"Special Place\" for Burma 
 
2. (C) On November 5 Indian Vice President Bhairon Singh 
Shekhawat concluded a 4-day visit to Burma that included 
stops in Rangoon, Mandalay, and Bagan.  The visit, the 
highest-level mission by an Indian leader in 16 years, 
received extensive and laudatory official press coverage. 
The Vice President met with numerous SPDC officials, 
including Chairman Senior General Than Shwe and Shekhawat\'s 
counterpart and host, SPDC Vice Chairman Vice-Senior General 
Maung Aye.  The official government newspaper, the New Light 
of Myanmar, gave daily coverage to Shekhawat\'s schedule and 
published a lengthy joint statement on the visit. 
 
3. (U) Vice President Shekhawat announced publicly that Burma 
has a \"special place\" in India\'s \"Look East\" policy and that 
India is seeking to double bilateral trade to $1 billion in 
the next three years.  However, concrete results of the trip 
were limited to a $57 million \"credit line\" to upgrade a rail 
link between Rangoon and Mandalay; a bilateral agreement on 
visa exemptions for official and diplomatic passports; and an 
unspecified MOU between the Burmese Ministry of Education and 
India\'s Ministry of Human Resource Development.  In late 
October, prior to the visit, the two sides also signed an 
agreement extending a $25 million credit line to Burma for 
importing Indian capital goods and \"consultancy\" services.  A 
glossy 50-page magazine issued by the Indian Embassy in 
commemoration of the Shekhawat visit extolled \"age old ties, 
new age relations\" between the two countries. 
 
Concern Over China Outweighs All 
 
4. (C) Indian Embassy officials characterized the trip 
primarily as a \"goodwill visit,\" and acknowledged that India 
might face criticism from the West for sending such a 
high-level official to exchange pleasantries with Burma\'s 
totalitarian regime, particularly in the wake of a massive 
crackdown on the democratic opposition.  However, our Indian 
contacts were quick to point out that India had numerous 
bilateral objectives that outweighed any trepidation about 
international reaction.  India, they said, had experienced 
decades of frosty relations with Burma, exacerbated by a 
thorny insurgency along the border between Manipur and Chin 
States.  The current warming between New Delhi and Rangoon 
created an opportunity to seek progress in resolving mutual 
border concerns and to secure Burma\'s support for India\'s 
aspirations to join the UN Security Council.  Most 
importantly, according to our Indian interlocutors, India 
intends to seize every opportunity to counter growing Chinese 
influence in Burma, even if this requires cozying up to the 
SPDC. 
 
5. (C) Contrary to the GOI\'s assertions that Shekhawat 
underscored the importance of democratization during his trip 
to Burma (ref A), our GOB contacts indicate that the Indians 
raised few political issues and \"nothing that was 
objectionable\" to the SPDC.  The regime gave Shekhawat a 
standard presentation on its seven-point road map for 
democracy, a plan notable for its glaring omission of Burma\'s 
pro-democracy parties and a timeline for a transition to a 
democratic government.  In the November 5 joint statement, 
the Indian Vice-President \"expressed support for the national 
reconciliation process and progress in the transition to 
democracy,\" a position that echoed the recent endorsement by 
ASEAN of Burma\'s road map. 
 
Comment:  A Missed Opportunity 
 
6.  (C) Vice President Shekhawat\'s visit was a domestic 
public relations success for the Burmese regime and reflects 
an emerging SPDC strategy to host senior-level leaders and 
regional meetings to increase its legitimacy and bolster its 
international image.  The Indian Embassy here will likely 
maintain a veneer of support for democratization, but will 
actively pursue trade promotion and other exchanges to 
counterbalance what India perceives as unchecked (by the 
U.S.) Chinese influence in Burma.  Ironically, Shekhawat\'s 
visit coincided with that of UN Special Rapporteur for Human 
Rights Pinheiro and the Indians thus missed an easy 
opportunity to address serious democracy and human rights 
issues with the SPDC.  Indian Embassy officials told us that 
Shekhawat put no pressure on the regime behind the scenes and 
his symbolic unveiling of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the 
University of Rangoon received scant press coverage. 
Meanwhile, democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, inspired by the 
non-violence tactics of Gandhi, remains under house arrest on 
University Boulevard, less than a mile from the University of 
Rangoon and the new statue.  End Comment.

 1. (C) Reftel indicated that UN Special Envoy Razali had 
requested a copy of the NLD videotape of the May 2003 ASSK 
convoy in northern Burma.  His intention to provide the tape 
to certain international journalists as a way to bring 
external pressure on the SPDC would fulfill a request by 
ASSK, as we understand it, through NLD intermediaries. 
 
2. (C) We would be happy to pouch a copy of the videotape to 
Embassy KL.  We note that the tape is primarily raw footage 
of the convoy and of various ASSK and NLD speeches, all in 
Burmese.  Shots of large crowds of supporters that number in 
the tens of thousands and scenes of aggressive MI and USDA 
thugs are visually very powerful.  However, we believe it 
would be most effective for an Embassy Rangoon officer to 
brief Razali during a viewing of the tape.  In addition to 
the speeches and chants in Burmese, the tape includes 
numerous posters and signs written in Burmese as well as 
footage of monks, pro-NLD villagers, anti-NLD protesters, and 
GOB handlers that create a subtle, yet crucial, sub-text to 
the convoy story. 
 
3. (C) We would suggest that Embassy KL communicate to Razali 
our offer to brief him on the videotape.  The most convenient 
opportunity to do so would be if Razali plans to be in 
Bangkok again soon, or during his next visit to Rangoon. 
Should neither opportunity be a short-term possibility, we 
could also send a briefing officer to KL with the videotape 
in hand.

1. (C) Summary: An Embassy trip to Burma\'s Kachin State 
secured additional support for our WWII remains recovery 
operations, but also revealed that the Government\'s ten-year 
old cease-fire agreement with the region\'s former insurgents 
masks deep suspicion of the SPDC and an active desire for 
self autonomy.  Drug use and HIV/AIDS are on the rise in 
Kachin State, but there are few signs of GOB attention to the 
development of Burma\'s northernmost region and the regime\'s 
primary focus is on securing a full surrender of the 
independence movement.  Much to the chagrin of the SPDC, the 
local population retains a close affinity for the United 
States, a legacy of American missionaries and close 
cooperation between Kachin Rangers and U.S. soldiers during 
WWII.  End Summary. 
 
Kachin State: A Remote Mixing Pot 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The DCM and the Defense Attache (DATT), joined by 
several other Embassy officers, traveled on October 1-3 to 
Kachin State, Burma\'s northernmost territory, wedged between 
China and India.  The main objective of the mission was to 
secure additional support for ongoing operations to recover 
the remains of World War II servicemen, but the trip also 
afforded Emboffs an opportunity to meet with a broad range of 
groups and ethnic minorities who reside in a region of Burma 
rich with a history of conflict and intrigue. 
 
3. (U) Most natives of Kachin State are of Tibeto-Burman 
origin and many of the local ethnic groups, as a result of 
19th and early 20th century American missionaries, are 
nominally Christian.  However, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and 
animist practices are also influential and the Kachin State 
capital city of Myitkyina is a mixing pot of Burma\'s many 
ethnic and religious groups.  Until the early 1990s, the 
Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) and its military arm, 
the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), controlled most of the 
state.  The Burmese regime reached a cease-fire agreement in 
1993 with the KIA, ending an active insurgency.  However, 
until just a couple of years ago the SPDC continued to treat 
Kachin State as a sensitive area and restricted the movement 
of foreigners and many Burmese.  The SPDC continues to 
designate some remote areas of Kachin State as off limits to 
U.S. Embassy personnel, including the jade-mining center of 
Hpakan. 
 
Cooperation for Remains Recovery 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Thousands of U.S. soldiers were killed along the 
\"Burma Road\" in Kachin State during WWII, aiding efforts to 
repel the Japanese invasion of Burma and supplying the China 
front with flights over \"The Hump.\"  The remains of several 
hundred airmen are missing in Kachin State and the Department 
of Defense and the U.S. Embassy began recovery efforts in 
2002.  U.S.-trained Kachin Rangers played an important combat 
and intelligence role in defeating the Japanese in the region 
and local sentiment remains overwhelmingly pro-American, even 
to this day. 
 
5. (C) In Myitkyina, the Embassy delegation met with SPDC 
Deputy Northern Commander, Brigadier General San Htun, to 
discuss plans for an upcoming investigative mission and a 
follow-on site excavation planned for February 2004.  BG San 
Htun informed the DCM and DATT that he was under strict 
instructions from his commanding officers in Rangoon to 
support fully the humanitarian/military operation, and added 
that he intended to provide complete security for all U.S. 
personnel participating in recovery efforts.  Regional 
military intelligence chief, Lt Col Tin Aung Gyi, said he was 
concerned that some of the proposed excavation sites were 
remote and inaccessible by helicopter, observing that snakes 
could pose problems for the American recovery teams (Note: 
LtC Tin Aung Gyi, speaking in Burmese, clarified to the 
Deputy Commander that he had referred to the reptile, not the 
\"other kind of snakes,\" a thinly veiled reference to KIA 
insurgents.  End note.) 
 
The Baptists 
------------ 
 
6. (SBU) Also in Myitkyina, the Embassy delegation held a 
lengthy meeting with the leadership of the Kachin Baptist 
Convention (KBC), a powerful association of church groups 
founded in 1910 by American Baptist missionaries.  With over 
300,000 members, the KBC plays an important role in Kachin 
politics and social development (former Secretary General 
Rev. Saboi Jum helped broker the 1993 cease-fire agreement). 
 
7. (C) KBC leaders were pessimistic about the state of 
affairs in Kachin State, criticizing the SPDC for morally 
corrupt governance and chastising the KIO for shady 
practices.  According to the KBC leaders, Kachin State is 
experiencing a disturbing growth in prostitution, opium 
cultivation and trafficking, and HIV/AIDS.  KBC youth leaders 
claimed that up to 60 percent of male teenagers in the state 
had used heroin or amphetamines, and that many young Kachin 
women were entering the sex industry in Rangoon or Thailand. 
As a result, the KBC remains closely engaged in the provision 
of basic services throughout the State. 
 
8. (C) The KBC leadership reserved its harshest criticism for 
human rights abuses attributed to the SPDC.  They claimed 
that most involuntary portering for military troops had ended 
with the 1993 cease-fire agreement, but said the regime 
continued to force local populations to provide labor for 
infrastructure projects and to participate in the SPDC\'s new 
people\'s militia.  The leaders also noted that government 
authorities had forced over 30,000 local residents, including 
all students and civil servants, to attend recent mass 
rallies in support of PM Khin Nyunt\'s road map for democracy. 
 
9. (C) According to the KBC leaders, NLD leader Aung San Suu 
Kyi\'s visit to Kachin State in May had many repercussions for 
local party members and supporters.  Military intelligence 
agents arrested NLD partisans and the USDA intimidated 
locals, threatening punishment for those who supported the 
NLD delegation or even stood on the streets to observe ASSK\'s 
passing convoy.  The wife of a homeowner who lodged ASSK in 
Myitkyina was arrested shortly after the visit and, over five 
months later, remains in detention.  USDA officials paid 
local unemployed youth and thugs with cash and booze to 
harass the NLD convoy and hit vehicles with sticks, and one 
bystander who saluted ASSK was severely beaten. 
 
The Catholics 
------------- 
 
10. (C) Catholic Church leaders of the diocese of Myitkyina 
hosted the Embassy delegation and, much like the Baptist 
leadership, expressed deep concern over dramatic increases in 
the use of illicit drugs and rising HIV/AIDS infection rates 
throughout Kachin State.  Senior priests, who represent a 
state-wide congregation of over 48 priests and 100,000 active 
Catholics, were sharply critical of the SPDC.  They expressed 
embarrassment, as one priest put it, \"for appearing to be 
deaf and dumb shepherds\" unable to lead their people out from 
under the heavy rule of an authoritarian regime. 
 
11. (C) In a formal speech to the U.S. delegation, a senior 
priest spoke on behalf of archdiocese Bishop Francis Tang, 
who was out of the country during our visit.  The speech, 
risky by Burmese standards in its political overtones, 
recalled cooperation between Americans and the 
\"temperamentally war-like\" Kachins to free the region from 
Japanese occupation.  The priest said that the Kachin people 
have a great desire and drive for self-autonomy, and their 
support for allied troops during WWII was symbolic of their 
ongoing aspirations for freedom.  Privately, the priests and 
nuns who met with us were even more fiery in their political 
views, with several inquiring as to when the U.S. would send 
troops into Burma to oust the SPDC. 
 
Big Brother is Watching 
----------------------- 
 
12. (C) The day after our meeting with the Catholic leaders, 
military intelligence (MI) agents descended on the parish 
compound and interrogated the priests and nuns about their 
hosting of the Embassy delegation.  Indeed, MI maintained a 
visible presence during our three days in Kachin State, 
tailing our small motorcade, staking out our hotel, pressing 
all of our interlocutors for details on our meetings, and, in 
several cases, discouraging local organizations from meeting 
with us altogether.  The KIO and a local OSS 101 veterans 
group both scrapped scheduled meetings with us due to 
heavy-handed pressure by MI officers. 
 
13. (C) Our visit to Myitkyina also included meetings with 
several international and local NGOs, including MSF-Holland 
(AZD), Metta Development Foundation, and the Shalom 
Foundation (the latter two created by Rev. Saboi Jum).  While 
these organizations are focused on separate priorities--such 
as health, agriculture, and conflict resolution--we heard a 
common theme about the resolve of the Kachin people to embark 
on self-help initiatives in the absence of resources from the 
SPDC.  While the NGOs muted their criticism of the regime, it 
was evident from our visit that the SPDC has done little 
since the cease-fire agreement to improve basic needs in 
Kachin State. 
 
North of North 
-------------- 
 
14. (C) The trip to Kachin State concluded with a half-day 
visit to Putao, a former British military post (Ft. Hertz) 
and Burma\'s northernmost town.  According to DAO records, 
this was the first visit to Putao by a U.S. military aircraft 
in at least 20 years.  The SPDC only recently opened Putao to 
foreign visitors and, with the town located in a pristine 
Himalayan zone, is beginning to encourage ecotourism in the 
region.  Our stay was too short to talk politics with the 
locals, but we were struck by the diversity of hill tribes 
and other ethnic groups, each with their own distinct housing 
architecture.  Although former dictator Ne Win expelled 
foreign missionaries from Burma in the 1960s, American 
Baptist and Assembly of God missionaries had also extended 
their reach to Putao and one of their legacies is thriving 
citrus fruit production. 
 
Comment:  Jade for Bridges 
-------------------------- 
 
15. (C) The SPDC continues to support our joint humanitarian 
remains recovery operations, but the regime is keen to limit 
U.S. influence in Kachin State over fears of rekindling an 
active insurgency.  The upcoming 10th anniversary of the 
cease-fire agreement between the GOB and the KIA, coming in 
close proximity to the KIO\'s revolutionary day on February 5, 
provides the SPDC with a pretext to seek a full surrender of 
the Kachin independence movement.  Although the Kachin people 
welcome the cessation of open hostilities, a desire for self 
autonomy remains strong and there is widespread 
disappointment that the cease-fire has not resulted in 
greater prosperity and government assistance in such sectors 
as health and education.  To the contrary, the SPDC is 
closely involved in the extraction of wealth from the State\'s 
natural resources such as timber and precious stones, 
primarily gold and the world\'s highest quality jade, which 
enriches only a select few locals.  In return, the SPDC has 
delivered little more than a few token infrastructure 
projects.

1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Burmese regime is quietly selecting 
delegates for a National Convention, the first step in 
implementing a new constitution, and may convene a body 
stacked with pro-SPDC delegates as early as January.  The NLD 
says it won\'t participate absent broader negotiations and 
Burma\'s leading ethnic pro-democracy party says (for now) it 
won\'t participate without the NLD.  However, many other 
ethnic nationalities now say they will send delegates.  It 
may prove impossible for ASSK and the NLD to influence, much 
less negate, the contrived \"democratic\" outcome of the 
fast-running SPDC road map.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SPDC IS RUNNING THE SHOW 
 
2.  (S) The SPDC is rapidly coming closer to accomplishing 
the first step in its \"road map to democracy:\" the holding of 
a National Convention to draft a new constitution.  According 
to a well-placed GOB source, and corroborated by ethnic 
leaders, the SPDC may announce in late December that it will 
convoke a 700-member National Convention as early as January 
2004.  Based loosely on a formula used for the ill-fated 1993 
National Convention, the SPDC in October began identifying 
and vetting nominees for eight \"delegations,\" giving more 
weight this time around to groups under the direct influence 
of the regime: 
 
- State Service Personnel (both military and civil service); 
- National Races (both ethnic political leaders and the 
cease-fire groups); 
- Peasants; 
- Workers; 
- Intelligentsia and Technocrats; 
- Elder Statesmen (retired senior ranking civil servants and 
retired politicians); 
- Political Parties (NLD, SNLD, National Unity Party, etc.); 
- Elected Officials (from the 1990 elections); 
 
CONVENTION DESIGN BY SPDC, INC. 
 
3.  (S)  According to our source, the SPDC is seeking to 
convoke a National Convention that is overwhelmingly 
pro-SPDC, including a 200-member delegation of military and 
civil servants.  In a first, the regime\'s mass member 
organization, the Union Solidarity and Development 
Association (USDA), will also participate and a 130-strong 
\"National Races\" delegation will encompass the cease-fire 
groups (CFG) and ethnic nationalities vetted by the SPDC 
(Note: Many CFG leaders are involved in lucrative, 
regime-granted economic concessions. End Note.)  Unlike the 
1993 Convention, the regime will not give the \"Elected 
Officials\" delegation the power of the pen for drafting a 
constitution.  Our sources tell us that the SPDC has already 
completed a draft and will expect the Convention to rubber 
stamp the final version. 
 
4.  (C) Citing security concerns, the SPDC will hold the 
convention in an old Officer Training School in Hmawbi, 
twenty miles north of Rangoon.  To underscore its 
seriousness, on Nov. 11 the SPDC published an unusual 
political notice in the government daily specifying as a top 
objective for the next Armed Forces anniversary in March \"to 
accomplish successfully the seven-point State road map.\" 
Significantly, the notice also warned that the SPDC will use 
the people\'s militia to \"crush all destructive elements\" 
disturbing progress on the road map, an ominous threat to the 
NLD. 
 
IS THE NLD IN, OR OUT? 
 
5.  (C) For their part, Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD have not 
signaled any intent to participate in a National Convention. 
According to UN Special Rapporteur Pinheiro\'s account of his 
recent discussions with ASSK, the only acceptable road map is 
one that is negotiated between the SPDC and NLD (ref A).  On 
Nov. 3 senior military intelligence official Brig Gen Kyaw 
Thein told the leaders of the cease-fire New Mon State Party 
(NMSP) that the NLD would be invited to join the National 
Convention as a political party.  However, Kyaw Thein said he 
had no idea whether the NLD, which won the 1990 elections, 
would also be included in the \"Elected Officials\" delegation. 
 
 
ETHNICS PREPARED TO PLAY BALL 
 
6.  (C) In early November, the SPDC extended a National 
Convention invitation to the main cease-fire groups -- Mon, 
Kachin, and Karenni.  All of the groups have RSVP\'d \"yes,\" 
but stipulated that they must be able to exercise their 
democratic rights in the process.  In the meantime, the 
leading ethnic democratic opposition party, the Shan 
Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD), says it won\'t 
participate without the NLD being involved.  SNLD leader Hkun 
Htun Oo, whose party garnered the second largest number of 
seats in 1990, also feels that the road map, as promulgated 
by the regime, does not meet SNLD requirements for political 
progress in Burma. 
 
COMMENT: A MOVING TRAIN 
 
7.  (C) Intent on hosting a glorious ASEAN summit in 2006 as 
an \"elected\" government (ref B), the regime has cobbled 
together a road map that commences with a showcase National 
Convention.  The SPDC may offer the NLD a deal to bring it 
into the Convention, or expect the party to request an invite 
on bent knee.  If the NLD refuses to get on this moving 
train, the SPDC may feel it will be vindicated in the eyes of 
ASEAN.  Regardless of the scenario, however, the regime has 
no intention to give the democratic opposition a voice in the 
drafting of a constitution.  Once the convention starts, the 
SPDC will control the venue, the agenda, and the outcome. 
Time and room to maneuver is running out for the democratic 
opposition.  END COMMENT.

1.  (C) NLD MP-elect U Hla Min, 65, credits UNSR Pinheiro 
with winning his release from prison November 9 after the 
regime held him for five months without charge.  Hla Min is 
the last of the Professional Development Program (PDP) 
students swept up in the post-May 30 anti-NLD crackdown to be 
released.  (Note:  PDP - protect - is a stealthy, 
embassy-sponsored training and development program for senior 
NLD cadre.)  Emboff met with Hla Min November 17 and received 
the following details of his arrest and imprisonment.  Hla 
Min\'s account typifies the personal sagas of numerous NLD 
members after May 30. 
 
2.  (C) Hla Min was traveling with Aung San Suu Kyi\'s convoy 
on her ill-fated trip, but he stayed behind on May 19 to get 
two broken-down cars repaired.  Help came from the Kachin 
Independence Organization, which may have inflamed the SPDC, 
he speculated.  Hla Min was arrested on June 3 in Rangoon and 
was kept at a township Military Intelligence camp for 45 days 
before being transferred to Insein Prison.  When he asked why 
he was imprisoned, \"disturbing the peace\" was the only answer 
he got.  He was able to call his family three times early on, 
received three food parcels while in Insein, and saw a doctor 
daily, who recorded his heartbeat and blood pressure. 
 
3.  (C) UNSR Pinheiro interviewed Hla Min on November 5 and 
expressed puzzlement as to why he was imprisoned.  Apparently 
no formal charges were ever filed against Hla Min, which 
enabled the authorities to release him on November 9.  Hla 
Min credits the Pinheiro interview for his relatively early 
release.  Hla Min said that had the regime filed formal 
charges, he was apt to have been sentenced to seven years, 
plus the two years knocked off his 1997 - 2001 jail term. 
When asked about any political plans, the NLD MP-elect 
shrugged and replied, \"We are just followers--with our 
leaders in prison we can\'t do anything.\"

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: In Burma, the Buddhist monkhood is a force 
second in size and power only to the ruling military.  The 
Burmese government has coerced and cajoled the country\'s most 
senior abbots into political line, thus indirectly 
controlling the rank and file.  However, the monkhood is a 
large and diverse group, and the senior abbots may not have 
the respect they once commanded.  Thus, the GOB\'s ironclad 
control over the whole group may be impermanent.  End summary. 
 
Proverb: \"Where Civil Power Fails, Religious Power is 
Required\" 
 
2. (U) At 400,000 strong, Burma\'s Buddhist monkhood, or 
sangha, is a force matched only in manpower by the equally 
robust Burmese military.  This number does not include the 
estimated 100,000 Buddhist nuns, women who have taken the 
tonsure to receive religious education, but who have no 
political power and do not receive the same respect from 
society as do their male counterparts.  The sangha is highly 
revered (as the military was) and is a vital element of 
Burmese history and national identity.  Like the military, 
the sangha defies easy categorization and generalizations. 
However, there is an organizational structure and some basic 
delineations that clarify the political role played by this 
important civil society group. 
 
3. (U) Traditionally, the reigning civil authority is 
reluctant to take direct action against the monkhood. 
Instead, orders and guidance impacting the sangha come 
directly from a 10-member ruling committee and its 47-member 
working committee.  Thus, control of these committees, 
comprised of senior abbots from around the country, is 
essential to control of the country\'s monks.  Not 
surprisingly, the GOB\'s Ministry of Religious Affairs 
hand-picks the committee members. 
 
A Sect for Every Monk 
 
4. (SBU) Beneath the state-controlled governing bodies, the 
monkhood is divided into three main sects: Thudamma, 
Shwekyin, and Nget Twin. 
 
-- Thudamma:  The largest and most influential sect. 
Thudamma is comparatively liberal in discipline and doctrine 
and is close to the government.  The sect\'s leaders are 
generally chosen because of a close relationship with SPDC 
officials.  The GOB often gives abbots from this sect 
preference when filling vacancies on the national sangha 
committees. 
 
-- Shwekyin: The second largest sect.  Shwekyin is much more 
conservative, requiring its members to practice austerity and 
strict adherence to Buddhist principles.  Though leaders of 
this sect tend to strike a politically neutral position, 
dealing with both the GOB and the democratic opposition, the 
Burmese leadership lends support to this sect because of its 
size and its solid reputation in international Buddhist 
circles.  The leader of the Shwekyin is always named vice 
chairman of the aforementioned sangha working committee. 
 
-- Nget Twin: The smallest of the three sects.  Nget Twin 
members have a religious and political profile close to that 
of the Thudamma sect, but are not involved in social 
activities. 
 
Young Man, There\'s a Place You Can Go 
 
5. (SBU) These days, Buddhism\'s political influence lies with 
the sangha and its associations.  Buddhism\'s original 
political arm, the Young Men\'s Buddhist Association (YMBA), 
founded in 1906, played a crucial role during the early fight 
for Burmese independence.  However, the organization is a 
shell of its former self.  The YMBA\'s current leader avows 
the group is apolitical, focusing now on promoting Buddhist 
education for children -- a campaign encouraged by the 
government -- and other humanitarian work.  The Ministry of 
Health, grasping around for local, independent NGOs to shore 
up an application to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, 
and Malaria (GFATM), drafted the YMBA to help provide 
HIV/AIDS education.  The YMBA will do this, by encouraging 
children to live clean, ethical lives according to Buddhist 
principles. 
 
Proverb: \"A Monk\'s Greed is Immeasurable\" 
 
6. (C) There is a long tradition in Burma of Buddhist monks 
leading opposition to unjust rulers.  Recognizing this, the 
military regime has displayed impressive stick and carrot 
work over the last 15 years to intimidate and co-opt the 
sangha\'s senior leadership and thus ensure the rank-and-file 
monks remain politically \"correct.\"  However, the sangha is 
not an entirely neutralized political force.  Many senior 
monks, especially of the Shwekyin faction, try to avoid 
choosing sides.  Furthermore, the abbots\' control of their 
acolytes, many of whom are not lifelong monks, may not be 
unquestioned.  We\'ve heard reliable accounts of young 
novices, though sworn to obedience and humility, grumbling 
over the cash and prizes they see the government heaping upon 
their greedy leaders.  Such grumbling may continue following 
the November 6th decision of the sangha working committee, 
with quiet direction from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, 
to close monastic schools, and impose a curfew on remaining 
monks, to avoid further Muslim-Buddhist violence (reftel).

Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Burma\'s 83rd National Day anniversary, 
commemorating a 1920 student strike that accelerated the 
independence movement, passed quietly on November 18 with the 
SPDC and the NLD and other pro-democracy groups holding 
separate, low-key ceremonies.  Broader NLD demonstrations 
failed to materialize, despite prodding from exile groups, 
and the regime\'s intelligence apparatus kept a close watch on 
all pro-democracy activities.  The SPDC released 58 prisoners 
on the eve of the holiday on \"humanitarian\" grounds, although 
none of the elderly men and pregnant women released were 
considered political prisoners.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On November 18 Burma observed National Day, a holiday 
that commemorates a 1920 student-led strike that protested 
the British colonial government\'s ham-fisted control of 
university-level education.  The strike empowered the Young 
Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA) and other nascent political 
groups, thereby galvanizing the independence movement. 
Although this year is the 83rd anniversary of the strike, 
National Day was not adopted until after independence in 1948. 
 
3. (SBU) On the morning of National Day this year, a small 
group of NLD members gathered at the Kyak-htat-gyi (\"Six 
Levels\") Pagoda near the party\'s shuttered headquarters in 
downtown Rangoon and offered meals to local monks.  Later in 
the day, a group of about 100 NLD youths proceeded to the 
Shwedagon Pagoda, Burma\'s most revered Buddhist shrine, and 
paid respects at a small monument dedicated to student 
leaders of the 1920 strike.  SPDC military intelligence 
maintained a heavy presence throughout the day at the 
Shwedagon Pagoda and videotaped the NLD youths.  There were 
no reports of arrests. 
 
4. (SBU) Also on National Day, the Veteran Politicians, a 
pro-democracy group of elderly activists and former GOB 
officials, held a commemorative event for about 400 guests. 
The Veterans called for the release of all political 
prisoners and a tripartite dialogue involving the nation\'s 
three largest forces (the SPDC, the NLD, and the ethnics) as 
\"the only way to peace and national reconciliation.\"  NLD 
members who attended the event issued a statement requesting 
the reopening of NLD offices and the unconditional release of 
the party\'s leaders, exhorting the regime to \"avoid 
procrastinating and leading the country into further depths 
of poverty.\" 
 
5. (C) The exiled National Council of the Union of Burma 
(NCUB), in a November 17 notice, had described NLD plans for 
a \"major event\" on National Day, including nationwide 
protests.  However, other than religious ceremonies at local 
pagodas, no such protests materialized. 
 
6. (U) On the eve of National Day, the GOB issued a statement 
announcing that it had commuted the sentences and released 58 
prisoners, \"taking into consideration humanitarian reasons.\" 
According to the GOB statement, 49 of the released prisoners 
were females either pregnant or with young children and the 
remaining nine were over the age of 65 years.  None the of 
the released prisoners were considered by the GOB or the NLD 
to be political detainees. 
 
7.  (C) Comment: The GOB\'s statement also noted that the 
Government \"will continue to release those that will cause no 
harm to the community nor threaten the existing peace, 
stability and the unity of the nation.\"  Observers in Rangoon 
interpret this as a message that the SPDC will only release 
political prisoners who confess to their transgressions and 
agree to refrain from future political activities.

SUBJECT: EXPOSING RISKS OF HIV/AIDS IN BURMA 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  The Ministry of Health held Burma\'s second 
annual HIV/AIDS exposition in Rangoon, attracting 70,000 
visitors, raising HIV/AIDS awareness, and administering 
on-site HIV/AIDS tests to those interested.  However, whether 
the expo successfully reached Burma\'s high-risk populations 
is unknown.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  The GOB held its second annual HIV/AIDS exposition in 
downtown Rangoon on Nov. 4 - 9, drawing PM Gen. Khin Nyunt 
and daily crowds of 10,000 visitors.  It was so well attended 
in fact that authorities extended the expo until November 12. 
 Representatives from the Ministry of Health, along with 
UNAIDS, UNICEF, WHO, UNDP, Population Services International 
(PSI), Medecins Sans Frontieres-Holland, Myanmar Maternal and 
Child Welfare Association, Myanmar Medical Association, 
Myanmar National Railways, and a host of other GOB, 
international NGO, and Government operated NGO organizations 
answered questions and handed out HIV/AIDS-related literature. 
 
3.  A walk around the exposition hall made it clear the event 
was designed to raise awareness and educate at all levels -- 
curious citizens, government employees, and thousands of 
visiting school children -- on the risks and consequences of 
activities that can spread HIV/AIDS.  Frank and sometimes 
graphic presentations of HIV/AIDS transmission vectors and 
HIV/AIDS symptoms adorned the walls of many of the booths. 
Visitors were given a plethora of professionally produced 
pamphlets on HIV/AIDS issues, including themes of 
heterosexual and homosexual transmission, intravenous drug 
use transmission, mother-fetus transmission, home-based care 
for family members living with HIV/AIDS, and also effective 
use of male and female condoms. 
 
4.  In addition to educating, the Ministry of Health also 
administered \"confidential\" HIV/AIDS tests and counseling on 
site, and by day seven of the expo had drawn blood from over 
130 visitors.  The Ministry also showcased an HIV/AIDS 
counseling telephone hotline reportedly available to the 
public throughout the year. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  Whether the exposition successfully targeted 
high risk groups was hard to gauge, but it was heartening to 
see the general population so well represented in the 
audience.  Though the confidentiality of the HIV/AIDS tests 
offered on site was impossible to determine, the Ministry 
official staffing the booth seemed firmly convinced that the 
testing process and results would be kept confidential.  The 
GOB will mark World AIDS day on December 1 with a low-key 
field day in a Rangoon Park, co-sponsored by UNAIDS and the 
Ministry of Sport.

1. (SBU) Summary: Two Iftaar dinners hosted recently by the 
Embassy community made great strides in improving already 
good relations with the Burmese and Diplomatic Muslim 
communities.  There were good exchanges on religious 
diversity, the role of Islam in the United States, religious 
tensions in Burma, and the importance of multilateral 
cooperation to combat terrorism.  Both events will lead to 
several follow-on steps, which will advance Embassy 
political, security, and religious freedom policy objectives. 
 End summary. 
 
Muslim Leaders Break Bread for Iftaar 
 
2. (U) A November 19 Iftaar dinner hosted by Chief of Mission 
(COM) and Embassy staff was extremely well received by nine 
Burmese Muslim leaders, and their spouses, who told us they\'d 
never before been invited by the U.S. Embassy to such an 
event.  The attendees at the dinner included scholars, and 
representatives of the Muslim youth league, Burma\'s only 
Muslim newspaper, and one of the country\'s two primary Muslim 
groups -- the Islamic Religious Affairs Council.  Burmese 
Muslims are predominately Sunni, however, the leader of the 
country\'s Shi\'ite minority also attended. 
 
3. (U) The dinner was quite collegial, with the COM 
discussing the importance of religious diversity and the 
prominence of Islam in the United States.  She also made the 
point that in discussions with the Burmese government on 
terrorism, the U.S. government was adamant that legitimate 
security concerns were not a pretext for further Burmese 
government oppression of the Muslim community. 
 
4. (C) On recent Buddhist-Muslim violence (ref c), the 
attendees said that there had been no further incidences 
since late October.  However, they admitted, there was still 
some atmosphere of fear in the Muslim quarters of Rangoon. 
One of the Iftaar guests had to leave the dinner early 
because he was due for \"neighborhood watch\" duty -- 
apparently arranged with the government so any sparks can be 
quickly reported to a responsible military official. 
 
5. (C) Another leader told us that the Ministry of Religious 
Affairs in mid-November reminded the Muslim community again 
to be wary and avoid \"provocative actions.\"  Consequently, 
the leader said, the Muslim organizations were warning their 
members this Ramadan to avoid paying homage all night at the 
graves of their relatives.  Leaders also said they had not 
asked for recent GOB actions to restrict Buddhist monks and 
monasteries (ref b).  On the contrary, they feared this 
crackdown might provoke Buddhist resentment against Muslims. 
 
Our Dinner with Muslim Diplomats 
 
6. (U) On November 15, the Air Attach also hosted an Iftaar 
dinner at his home for Defense Attaches from Bangladesh, 
Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia and their families.  The 
guests said they enjoyed the evening and were very pleased 
with the fellowship that came from breaking fast together. 
During the evening, those present discussed issues such as 
the root causes of international terrorism, how to deal with 
terrorists, and the need for further cross-border information 
sharing and cooperation.  In the end, all agreed that 
building relationships that increase our mutual understanding 
is a crucial first step toward working better together in the 
future to stop trans-national terrorism and other national 
security threats. 
 
Comment: The Beginning of Beautiful Friendships 
 
7. (SBU) Both Embassy-hosted Iftaars were solid stepping 
stones to even closer relations with the Burmese and 
diplomatic Muslim community.  The Defense Attach and other 
Embassy officials will continue to engage Rangoon-based 
diplomats from Muslim countries on security cooperation, and 
local religious and political issues.  In addition, we are 
already planning several follow-on steps for cultivating our 
ties to the Burmese Muslim community.  Following the COM\'s 
Iftaar dinner, several of the Muslim leaders invited Embassy 
hosts to their headquarters to attend future Iftaar dinners. 
Another leader invited the Chief of Mission to visit a local 
madrassa that teaches about Islam in English.  We also 
received many requests from the Burmese Muslims for more 
information on Muslims in the United States; requests that 
our Public Diplomacy section will quickly meet.

1. (C) Summary:  Burma hosted a four-country economic summit 
in mid-November, producing few tangible results but 
delivering another public relations coup for a military 
regime in the hunt for international legitimacy.  The Thai 
Embassy in Rangoon says that their delegation pressed the 
generals in private on democracy issues, but the summit 
itself was decidedly apolitical.  End Summary. 
 
The Economic Cooperation Strategy 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) On November 12, Burmese Prime Minister General Khin 
Nyunt hosted his counterparts from Thailand, Cambodia, and 
Laos for an inaugural summit of the \"Economic Cooperation 
Strategy\" (ECS).  The summit, held in the ancient capital of 
Bagan, was preceded on November 10 by a senior officials 
meeting (SOM) and a foreign ministers meeting (FM) in 
Rangoon.  As noted in ref A, the four prime ministers had 
originally agreed to the summit during an April gathering in 
Bangkok. 
 
3. (SBU) The GOB has not responded to requests from the 
diplomatic community for a post-summit brief, although the 
official press gave considerable coverage to the ceremonial 
aspects of the event.  According to our local contacts, and 
the Thai Embassy in Rangoon, the summit produced a \"Bagan 
Declaration\" on mutual economic and trade issues and a 
ten-year ECS Plan of Action.  The summit participants agreed 
to hold a Summit every two years, and SOM/FM meetings in 
intervening years.  As the inaugural host, Burma will hold 
the Secretariat through 2005 (which includes hosting a SOM/FM 
in 2004). 
 
And a Little Time For Politics 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) According to the Thai Embassy, the joint summit did 
not address Burma\'s domestic political situation (although 
the Bagan Declaration made a passing reference to generic 
ASEAN governance principles).  However, PM Thaksin had a 
working breakfast with PM Khin Nyunt on November 11 and 
reportedly encouraged the SPDC to include all political 
parties and ethnic groups in the regime\'s road map for 
democracy.  Thaksin also pressed for increased 
counternarcotics cooperation, expressing a desire to \"solve 
the drug problem once and for all.\"  The Thai Embassy 
observed that PM Thaksin\'s pitch for Burma to become an 
active partner in the ECS was an easy one, noting that the 
Burmese PM appeared \"desperate\" for the Thai economic 
cooperation offered under the strategy. 
 
5. (C) The Thai and Burmese Foreign Ministers also held a 
bilateral meeting in Rangoon to discuss economic matters and 
road linkages (the latter is a priority for the SPDC and the 
Thai have offered soft loans, but neither side has yet to 
designate a budget).  During their working dinner, FM Win 
Aung claimed to his Thai counterpart that NLD leader Aung San 
Suu Kyi is not under arrest and that the GOB is fully 
committed to a democratic transition. 
 
The Burmese Contribution 
------------------------ 
 
6. (C) The SPDC left the substantive heavy hitting to the 
Thai and reserved their elbow grease for the logistics of 
putting on, by Burmese standards, a major international 
event.  Over 200 officials were part of the four delegations, 
and several ministries--including Foreign Affairs, Defense, 
and Transportation--relocated their key departments to Bagan 
for the duration of the summit.  We understand that, for the 
most part, the summit went off without a hitch.  However, the 
co-owner of Burma\'s premier golf resort in Rangoon told us 
that an unfortunate incident involving a wayward golf cart 
sent the Lao Prime Minister\'s golf bag to the bottom of a 
water hazard, where several of his clubs were lost in the 
muck. 
 
COMMENT:  Thai Initiative, SPDC Showcase 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) As predicted (ref B), the SPDC did not measure the 
success of the Bagan summit by deliverables.  Indeed, the 
only tangible outcome of the event was the apparent signing 
of six \"memos\" between Thailand and other participants on 
energy and industrial development, none of which are binding 
and none of which included all four of the ECS countries. 
Rather, the key objective for the regime was the Nov. 11 
photo op of three neighboring prime ministers calling on SPDC 
Chairman Senior General Than Shwe, an opportunity that 
provided considerable mileage for the Burmese generals in 
their hot pursuit of international legitimization. 
 
8. (C) Despite the seemingly transparent goals of the ECS, 
most observers in Rangoon, including the Thai Embassy, tell 
us that the strategy is a personal initiative of PM Thaksin 
designed to boost productivity in the \"laggard\" ASEAN 
countries and to broaden the resource base for the Thai 
economy.  As one Thai diplomat put it, \"Thailand cannot be 
well off if our neighbors are dragging,\" adding that Thailand 
accounts for 91 percent of the combined GDP of the four ECS 
countries.  The ECS prime ministers also endorsed a Thai-led 
tourism campaign titled \"Four countries, one destination,\" 
agreeing to pursue a single visa valid for travel in any of 
the four countries.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BUSINESSWOMEN KNOCKING ON TEAK CEILING 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: While striving to retain its political 
independence, the Myanmar Women\'s Entrepreneur Association 
(MWEA) has had some success helping established Burmese 
businesswomen climb the business ladder.  Though it has had 
less success building economic capacity at the lower rungs of 
the ladder, MWEA continues to run a small micro-credit 
program in several Rangoon markets.  All in all, we are 
encouraged that a large, but neglected, portion of the 
Burmese business community is being exposed to important 
international business principles.  End summary. 
 
Stanford in the Lead 
 
2. (SBU) The Myanmar Women\'s Entrepreneur Association (MWEA), 
founded by a Burmese graduate of Stanford University\'s MBA 
program, is focusing on a neglected element in Burma\'s 
atrophied economy -- women.  Women often do not have access 
to as much capital as men, and social norms frown on young 
women (under 40) being too ambitious or aggressive in 
business or elsewhere.  However, Burmese tradition does not 
prohibit women from entering the workplace or running a 
business.  In fact, women dominate certain, mostly retail or 
brokering, sectors of the economy.  Though girls still face 
educational discrimination at the lower levels, the country\'s 
relatively new MBA program has gone from 1/3rd women to about 
40-50 percent women in about five years. 
 
3. (U) MWEA, now with approximately 1,200 members, was 
founded in 1995 and has managed to steer a tenuous path 
between government approval, a necessity for survival, and 
co-option -- the death knell for creativity and independence. 
 Unlike other women\'s \"NGOs\" in Burma, MWEA does not have any 
grande dame (usually the wife of one of the State Peace and 
Development Committee\'s Big 3) at its helm -- instead it is 
chaired and co-chaired by senior Burmese businesswomen. 
Likewise it is not directly affiliated with any government 
ministries, nor does it receive any GOB funding.  After some 
debate, MWEA decided against affiliating itself with the 
government\'s mass member political organization the Union 
Solidarity and Development Association (USDA). 
 
Going Low... 
 
4. (SBU) To try and boost up women on the lowest rungs of the 
business ladder, MWEA is running an income generation program 
in several Rangoon marketplaces.  MWEA is reluctant to call 
its work \"micro-credit,\" as such a program would fall afoul 
of Burma\'s archaic banking laws.  However, MWEA is providing 
very small loans (usually about US$5) and charging 3 percent 
monthly interest over 12 months.  Interest is plowed back 
into a revolving fund, allowing larger loans (up to US$10). 
Even in Burma, though, there is not much that can be done 
with such small sums.  The ultimate objective is to gradually 
expand the amounts available and then teach participants how 
to borrow from the official banking system. 
 
5. (SBU) Though micro-credit has had success in Burma, under 
the auspices of UNDP or large foreign corporations, MWEA has 
thus far been frustrated.  The founder commented that most 
small businesswomen in the markets are ignorant and 
suspicious of formal banking and are thus reluctant to do any 
paperwork or take on any formal responsibility -- even for a 
larger sum of money.  MWEA\'s micro-loans are now all done 
informally.  She also blames a lack of managerial resources 
and vision at her own organization for the program\'s poor 
results.  The larger internationally funded micro-credit 
projects in Burma, she argues, benefit from a large support 
infrastructure, including education for borrowers and regular 
assistance from project staff, that MWEA cannot muster. 
 
Going High... 
 
6. (SBU) The MWEA has had more success working with its 
membership, generally women already firmly on the ladder. 
MWEA\'s founder told us she is encouraged to see more and more 
young, technically savvy women joining the organization.  She 
credits regular seminars and workshops, many of which are 
funded by foreign governments and foundations, for inspiring 
some members with new ideas about sound business practices. 
She is pleased that younger women, both MWEA members and at 
the country\'s MBA program, seem to be absorbing concepts of 
accountability and corporate responsibility that are not part 
of Burma\'s traditional business culture.  Likewise, she said, 
the notion is sinking in that there is a linkage between 
national economic growth and a positive business climate -- a 
concept quite foreign to the current regime and its cronies. 
 
Comment: Building Capacity 
 
7. (SBU) Because women are not generally commanding 
large-scale manufacturing or construction companies, they are 
perhaps less susceptible to government pressure and the 
allures of corruption and cronyism.  We don\'t want to 
overstate the role of these entrepreneurs in the current 
economic system, or the ability of the MWEA to work miracles. 
 However, it is encouraging to see a business organization 
dedicated to spreading the gospel of corporate governance, 
accountability, and entrepreneurship among Burma\'s relatively 
independent businesswomen.

SUBJECT: SPDC LIFTS HOUSE ARREST RESTRICTIONS FOR FIVE NLD 
LEADERS 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  On November 23 and 24, the SPDC lifted house 
arrest restrictions imposed upon five senior NLD leaders. 
NLD members welcome the news that five of the \"Uncles\" have 
been released; however, the party\'s four core leaders, 
including ASSK, remain under SPDC-imposed isolation.  The 
Department should welcome the lifting of restrictions for the 
five CEC members, but continue to insist on full freedom for 
remaining NLD leaders, the release of detained party members, 
and the release of all political prisoners.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On November 23 and 24, Burma\'s military regime, the 
SPDC, quietly lifted house arrest restrictions on five 
members of the NLD\'s Central Executive Committee (CEC). 
Authorities had placed the five leaders -- U Nyunt Wei, U 
Than Tun, U Hla Pe, U Soe Myint, and U Lun Tun -- under house 
arrest in the aftermath of the May 30 assault on Aung San Suu 
Kyi (ASSK) and her NLD convoy.  Remaining CEC members ASSK 
(General Secretary), U Lwin (Spokesman), and U Aung Swe 
(Chairman) continue to be held under house arrest while NLD 
Vice Chairman, and CEC member, U Tin Oo remains imprisoned in 
a Sagaing Division jail. 
 
3. (C) Three of the \"released\" CEC members -- U Than Tun, U 
Nyunt Wei, and U Hla Pe -- met together on November 24 to 
take stock of recent developments and to consider next steps 
for the NLD.  According to the three, SPDC Brigadier General 
Than Tun, head of the regime\'s military intelligence 
political department, visited each of the NLD leaders\' homes 
on November 23 to inform them individually that all 
\"security\" restrictions had been lifted.  The NLD\'s U Than 
Tun pressed Brigadier General Than Tun on the release of 
remaining CEC members and was told to \"be patient.\"  However, 
the general apparently intimated that he had forgotten about 
U Lun Tun, who was subsequently released on November 24. 
 
4. (C) The SPDC informed the released CEC members that they 
are free to associate and engage in political activities, but 
that NLD offices will remain shuttered.  U Than Tun told us 
that his house will serve as de facto party headquarters for 
the foreseeable future.  The CEC\'s immediate objectives, 
according to the freed leaders, include seeking the release 
of remaining CEC members and pursuing plans to reopen NLD 
offices. 
 
5. (C) On November 24, we stopped by U Nyunt Wei\'s house for 
a visit.  Family members told us he was out enjoying his new 
found freedom and we saw no signs of military intelligence or 
police surveillance at his compound, unlike our attempted 
visit on November 3 when MI thugs blocked our path and 
forcibly pushed U Nyunt Wei back behind his gate.  We also 
met on November 24 with second tier NLD leaders who had 
secretly convened a rump NLD leadership council just one week 
 
SIPDIS 
ago to consider next steps for the party.  However, with news 
that senior NLD leaders are back on the active roster, the 
mid-level members have mutually agreed to back down and 
\"await instructions\" from the party hierarchy. 
 
6. (C) Comment: Freedom for half of the NLD\'s senior 
leadership is welcome news.  However, the party\'s four core 
leaders remain under SPDC-imposed isolation.  Post recommends 
that the Department welcome the lifting of restrictions for 
the five CEC members, but continue to insist on full freedom 
for remaining NLD leaders, the release of NLD members 
detained in connection to the May 30 attack, and the release 
of all political prisoners.  End comment.

Classified By: RONALD K. MCMULLEN, DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION, REASON 1.5( 
C). 
 
1.   (U)  The following are incidents of hostile intelligence 
service activity reported by Embassy officers in recent weeks. 
 
2.   (S/NF)  On November 11 the Deputy Chief of Mission 
hosted an event at his residence for the official Amcit 
community.  Military Intelligence (MI) officers  questioned 
two drivers as they waited outside the DCR compound. 
According to one driver, MI used intimidation tactics and was 
more aggressive than in previous encounters.  In particular, 
the MI officers asked about the purpose of the event, who was 
in attendance, the position and title of the attendees, 
residential addresses, and phone numbers. 
 
3.   (S/NF)  On November 18 Post learned that MI officers 
were using a copy of an Embassy in-country travel itinerary 
to identify and question contacts visited on a domestic 
orientation trip.  MI even questioned an individual listed on 
the itinerary with whom Emboffs did not meet. We do not know 
how, or if, MI officers obtained a copy of the actual 
itinerary or information contained in the itinerary.  The 
document was created on the State Department unclassified 
email system and forwarded between various sections within 
the Embassy for revision.  The document was also faxed over 
local telephone lines to Shan State in advance of the trip. 
It is also possible that MI pieced together the information 
from phone calls made from Post to Shan State. 
 
4.   (S/NF)  Foreigners and diplomats are regularly 
surveilled in Burma.  The Government of Burma (GOB) 
aggressively targets western events, hotels, meeting areas, 
popular restaurants and maintains a heightened state of 
paranoia.  Intelligence collection is the regime\'s primary 
mechanism for maintaining internal control and monitoring 
political opposition.  These activities occur throughout the 
country wherever foreigners are found. 
 
5.   (SBU)  RSO Rangoon has repeatedly cautioned employees 
about operational security and the aggressive intelligence 
collection efforts of the GOB.  RSO encourages employees to 
immediately report any incidents of surveillance, 
questioning, and photographing including harassment of 
dependents and domestic staff.  RSO reviews the required 
contact reporting policies set forth in 12 FAM 262 with all 
newly assigned personnel.  RSO does not feel that the 
above-mentioned incidents are the result of heightened 
hostile intelligence service activity, but are more likely 
indicative of the GOB\'s normal targeted efforts against the 
United States.

SUBJECT:  BURMA: 2003 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: A) STATE 301352  B) RANGOON 380 
 
1. (SBU) Letters below correspond to questions in ref A, 
para 2. 
 
A.  Burma\'s solid position against international terrorism 
continued in 2003.  Burma has ratified, acceded to, or 
signed six of the twelve international counter-terrorism 
conventions and indicated it is considering fast action on 
at least five more (ref B).  It has conducted in-house 
reviews of obligations and implications of joining several 
others.  The regime previously enacted, but has not yet 
implemented, an anti-money laundering law that could help 
block terrorist assets.  The military government is fighting 
several low-intensity conflicts against ethnic insurgents. 
At least one of these groups is alleged to have ties to 
South Asian extremist (possibly terrorist) elements. 
 
B.  The junta has occasionally sought to portray insurgent 
attacks against infrastructure (i.e., bridges and pipelines) 
as terrorism, but there were no known incidents of 
international terrorism per se in Burma during 2003.  On 
March 27 two IEDs were found in Rangoon, one of which 
exploded and killed two municipal workers.  The 
perpetrators\' identities and motives are unclear, but the 
junta arrested a number of anti-regime activists on charges 
related to these incidents.  Dozens of IEDs exploded or were 
discovered in various locations throughout Burma during the 
year.  With the exception of two bombings of an oil 
pipeline, claimed by the insurgent Karen National Union, 
there were no claims of responsibility for these acts. 
 
C.  No. 
 
D.  The regime applies the rule of law sporadically and the 
judiciary is not independent.  There is no extradition 
treaty with the United States, although the rendering of 
suspects to third countries is technically possible. 
 
E.  The Burmese cooperate in information sharing on counter- 
terrorism issues. 
 
F.  An example of Burma\'s counter-terrorism cooperation is 
the security presence the regime has provided to seven U.S. 
diplomatic sites, including the chancery, embassy annexes, 
and several residences.  It has maintained the closure of 
Merchant Street, a major municipal artery fronting the 
chancery, at the USG\'s request and despite the inconvenience 
to the city.  Without that street closure the chancery would 
have no frontal setback. 
 
G.  None. 
 
H.  No. 
 
I.  The Burmese strong anti-terrorism position in 2002 has 
been somewhat muted in 2003, perhaps in reaction to the war 
in Iraq, which the Burmese junta strongly opposed.

1. (C) Summary: Senior NLD leader U Nyunt Wei, newly released 
from house arrest, says his pro-democracy party will refuse 
to participate in the regime\'s reconvened National 
Convention.  He expressed surprise at his own release and 
pondered whether ASSK and other CEC members might also get a 
surprise release.  The freed NLD \"Uncles\" will soon feel 
pressure from the party\'s rank and file to take action in the 
face of SPDC plans to enact a new constitution.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On November 25 we called on U Nyunt Wei, the NLD\'s 
Harvard-trained senior economist and a member of the party\'s 
nine-person Central Executive Committee (CEC).  The SPDC 
released U Nyunt Wei and four of his CEC colleagues on 
November 23-24, after more than five months of house arrest 
(reftel).  The 77 year-old party activist, and Member of 
Parliament-elect, is in good health and says he is well 
rested after months of reading books on Buddhism and 
following political developments via BBC and VOA short-wave 
radio broadcasts. 
 
3. (C) U Nyunt Wei says that he has no idea why the regime 
decided to release him and other CEC members at this time. 
He had mentally prepared himself to spend several years under 
house arrest while the SPDC proceeded with a National 
Convention and new elections.  He intimated that he expects 
the regime will keep ASSK and other CEC members isolated, but 
noted that \"maybe the authorities will surprise them, like 
they did me.\"  He offered that the SPDC may have released 
some CEC members now because \"we are old men or because they 
expect us to join the National Convention.\" 
 
4. (C) Shrugging off his house arrest, U Nyunt Wei described 
the regime\'s treatment of NLD leaders as \"part of our job 
description.\"  He called GOB authorities \"idiots\" for 
claiming NLD leaders were not under house arrest or were in 
so-called \"protective custody.\"  The feisty NLD official said 
the regime has the power and confidence to arrest and detain 
at will and therefore should have no reason to distort their 
actions.  \"And yet,\" U Nyunt Wei lamented, \"they perpetuate 
the Big Lie, much like the Nazis and the Soviets.\" 
 
5. (C) U Nyunt Wei said he had met earlier with his fellow 
released CEC members.  On this, their second, day of freedom, 
however, the \"Uncles\" convened at CEC member U Lun Tin\'s 
house because the latter, having suffered a stroke, is 
physically unable to move about the city.  U Nyunt Wei said 
the CEC members have agreed that they will refuse to 
participate in the SPDC\'s reconvened National Convention. 
\"The reasons the NLD walked out in 1995 remain valid,\" he 
said, \"the SPDC must bring democratic principles and 
practices to any process that addresses the future of Burma.\" 
 U Nyunt Wei added that he would be more favorable toward a 
Constituent Assembly of elected representatives, rather than 
a sham Convention. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  U Nyunt Wei is clearly enjoying his new 
freedom and observed that he welcomed the odd feeling of 
being able to depart his modest Rangoon compound and escort 
us from his gate to our car.   Whether he is enjoying being 
back in the political saddle is less certain.  He told us 
that when his SPDC handler arrived to inform him that house 
arrest restrictions had been lifted, he joked \"My dear 
general, you don\'t realize what work you are creating for 
me.\"  As the regime plows forth toward a new constitution and 
most of their peers are enjoying retirement, U Nyunt Wei and 
the other aging NLD \"Uncles\" will feel considerable pressure 
from the party\'s restless rank and file to create a new path 
forward for the democracy movement.   End comment.

1. (C) Summary: Considering the dismal state of the Burmese 
economy, it is surprising that the Burmese state remains both 
viable and stable.  How is that people are able to quietly 
endure and survive?  How can the ruling military regime be in 
a stronger position than ever?  We see three major factors at 
work: (1) a well developed informal economy, (2) a sufficient 
supply of food and of high-value, highly prized natural 
resources, and (3) wealthy and friendly neighbors who are 
willing to conduct business as usual despite the economic and 
political transgressions of the current regime.  Though these 
do not make a good recipe for long-term economic development, 
they work well enough for immediate survival. End summary. 
 
First the Bad News 
 
2. (C) There can be no dispute that over the last several 
years, Burma\'s formal economic indicators have been quite 
negative.  Tales are legion, and well documented by the 
international media, the IMF, the UN, and Embassy Rangoon 
(ref E, F, G), of misguided economic policies leading to 
economic woe and hardship for the Burmese people, spiraling 
inflation and a plummeting kyat, the hollowing out of Burma\'s 
formal economy, and departing foreign investors.  We continue 
to be pessimistic about the formal economy\'s future, and are 
confident that the next IMF Article IV assessment (due out 
early next year) will bear us out. 
 
3. (C) The UN and international NGOs have also made clear the 
terrible social conditions in which the Burmese people live; 
in part due to poor economic policies, in part due to cruel 
budgetary choices by the GOB.  For example, the GOB budgeted 
only US$10 million, about one percent of the proposed 
national budget in FY 2003-04, for health for a population of 
50 million (ref H).  Unfortunately, we do not anticipate a 
reverse in these trends anytime soon. 
 
The Cockroach Lives 
 
4. (C) However, like the proverbial cockroach in a nuclear 
blast, the Burmese economy and the country\'s senior 
leadership continue to survive and, in the case of the 
generals and their cronies, thrive in this harsh climate.  We 
see three major reasons for this: (1) a large, 
well-established, and cushioning informal economy, (2) 
abundant and highly sought after natural resources, and (3) 
politically and economically supportive neighboring states. 
It is these factors which help keep Burma from becoming a 
classic \"failed state\" and can explain, in part, the Burmese 
people\'s placid acceptance of what the numbers show to be 
increasingly hard times. 
 
Wanna Buy a Watch? 
 
5. (C) The informal economy, though arguably the most 
important to the people\'s ability to survive, is the most 
difficult to quantify.  We have heard estimates that the gray 
and black market, with strong roots in the nation\'s socialist 
era (1962-88), is as much as three or four times larger than 
the formal economy.  This sector encompasses a vast array of 
shops and vendors, cottage industries, unreported farming, 
gambling and entertainment, narcotics, and financial 
services.  This sector also includes extremely active 
smuggling networks -- particularly overland with neighboring 
China, Thailand, and Bangladesh, and with Malaysia by sea via 
Burma\'s southern port of Kawthaung.  Because of Burma\'s 
restrictive and confusing import regulations, most of this 
smuggling brings in needed consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, 
diesel fuel, cooking oil, or whatever else is in shortage at 
the moment.  Outflow is in agricultural products and 
high-value items like hardwoods, gems, and narcotics. 
 
6. (C) People are very comfortable with these informal 
methods, often more so than with \"newfangled contraptions\" 
like private banks.  The informal economy is also incredibly 
elastic -- able to expand and contract easily in response to 
the country\'s evolving economic condition. 
Trading Teak for Legitimacy 
7. (C) The country\'s abundant resources and fertile soil are 
crucial to the people\'s survival, but are also exploited by 
the ruling regime.  Though price inflation and distribution 
problems have led to widespread malnutrition and even food 
shortages in parts of the country, few are starving.  Despite 
a lack of reliable data, we believe Burma still produces an 
annual food surplus.  With a weak manufacturing sector, and 
government jobs paying next to nothing, farming and resource 
extraction remain the country\'s largest employers -- both 
organized and informally.  Also, especially in rural areas, 
people rely on consumption and informal selling of 
agricultural and forest products to supplement their diets 
and incomes. 
 
8. (C) Government or military domination, either through 
monopoly or licensing, of the extraction and sale of 
high-value natural resources and some farm products provides 
a steady source of foreign exchange income through export 
revenue and taxes, profit sharing, leases, and license fees. 
Solidifying this cash flow is the comparative wealth of 
neighbors like Thailand and China, who have an appetite for 
Burmese raw materials.  Burma also benefits because some of 
its resources, such as jade and teak, are considered the 
highest quality in the world.  Thus there is very strong 
international demand for these products that has proven very 
resistant to boycott pressure. 
 
9. (C) Two notable cash cows for the government are copper 
and natural gas.  According to IMF statistics, Burma\'s copper 
production rose from 472,000 long tons in FY 1997-98 to 24.5 
million long tons in FY 2001-02.  Copper industry sources 
tell us deposits, which are focused in one area near Monywa, 
Sagaing Division, are such that extraction could be increased 
manifold if financing were available.  This mine is in the 
process of being sold to the Chinese quasi-parastatal CITIC. 
As for natural gas, the development of two offshore sites by 
foreign investors, and a ready customer in Thailand, mean 
about US$350 million net for the GOB coffers per year 
beginning in 2003.  There is also talk of new South 
Korean/Indian investment in a potential gas field off the 
coast of Rakhine State. 
 
Help from Non-Interference Policies 
 
10. (C) The \"friendly neighbors\" factor dovetails with the 
other parts of the equation, and is the most vital to the 
survival of the ruling junta.  As reported in ref C, from the 
Thai perspective trade with Burma is relatively small 
potatoes.  However, for Burma, a consistently reliable Thai 
market for natural gas and timber -- accounting for the 
majority of Burma\'s US$902 million of exports to Thailand in 
2002 -- is very important to the regime\'s wallet and well 
being.  According to RTG statistics, imports of Burmese 
products have risen steadily since 1998.  These numbers are 
understated due to an unknown quantity of illegal exports 
(mostly drugs and timber) to Thailand from border zones under 
the economic suzerainty of various ethnic ceasefire groups. 
Burmese people and private businesses rely on consumer goods 
imported and smuggled from Thailand.  Further north, IMF 
numbers show that Chinese demand for Burmese raw materials, 
mostly gems and timber, is still relatively small, but has 
steadily increased since 1998. 
 
11. (C) It\'s not just China and Thailand\'s taste for 
GOB-controlled natural resources that help keep the regime in 
power and resistant to U.S. sanctions.  China has been 
actively extending trade benefits, seller\'s credit, and other 
concessional loans to Burma.  Thailand just recently 
launched, at a summit meeting in Burma, an \"Economic 
Cooperation Strategy\" to extend loans, development aid, and 
trade preferences to Burma, Laos, and Cambodia (refs A and 
B).  India too is joining the game, though bilateral trade is 
still tiny in comparison to Thailand and China, extending new 
trade credits and cheap loans (ref D).  Public political 
support from China, India, and Thailand gives the SPDC 
tremendous confidence and comfort to go alongside economic 
survivability. 
 
Comment: SPDC Won\'t Go Down with the Ship 
 
12. (C) The extraction and export by the government and its 
foreign and local contractors, of raw resources, with no 
local value added, is wasteful and does little to develop the 
economy -- which remains 50 percent agricultural.  Also, 
there are already whiffs of resource exhaustion of some 
precious metals and gems, and a fear of deforestation is 
clear and present.  These trends may accelerate as the regime 
becomes more desperate for cash in the face of U.S. sanctions 
that have been effective in cutting off most formal conduits 
for the inflow of U.S. dollars.  The SPDC is not making 
policy for long-term, efficient, development of the economy 
but for self-perpetuation and national stability.  Thus its 
survivability and the sustainability of the Burmese people at 
subsistence levels are feasible in the short-term, regardless 
of what the economic numbers say.

1. (C) Summary: Recently released senior leaders of the NLD 
indicate they will remain politically active and press ahead 
with the challenge of reviving the democracy movement and 
protecting the survival of their political party.  However, 
the \"Uncles\" admit that they find it difficult to form a 
political strategy in the absence of their detained CEC 
colleagues, including ASSK.  In the interim, they welcome 
external pressure and encourage more of the same.  End 
Summary. 
 
The Uncles Re-Emerge 
-------------------- 
 
2. (C) On December 2, COM and Emboffs called on the recently 
released members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) 
Central Executive Committee (CEC).  The Burmese regime lifted 
house arrest restrictions on U Nyunt Wei, U Than Tun, U Hla 
Pe, U Soe Myint, and U Lun Tin on November 23 and 24 and the 
five leaders have been meeting regularly at U Than Tun\'s 
modest Rangoon residence.  Although the NLD \"Uncles\" did not 
suffer any serious health problems while under house arrest, 
the leaders, who average 80 years of age, are clearly coping 
with the aches and pains of aging. 
 
3. (C) The Uncles, who have only met with British and 
Americans among the diplomatic corps (reftel), described 
themselves as actively picking up NLD party activities where 
they left off before house arrest in early June.  They 
convene every work day of the week and within recent days met 
with several NLD division leaders to discuss regional party 
activities.  The NLD leaders said that they have been meeting 
freely without military intelligence interference, although 
they have experienced periodic phone outages and do not have 
authorization to reopen party offices (note: a bevy of MI 
agents conducted surveillance of our meeting with the Uncles. 
 End note). 
 
No Political Games 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) U Nyunt Wei described the current environment as \"an 
exciting, important period of change,\" but acknowledged that 
the Uncles were operating \"somewhat in the dark\" without the 
remaining four members of the CEC, including ASSK.  They 
Uncles said they do not know if or when their colleagues will 
be released, but they plan to initiate communications with 
ASSK.  \"However,\" U Nyunt Wei insisted, \"we will not march 
down University Avenue to knock on her door so that Radio 
Free Asia can report the regime turned us away.\"  He 
explained that the Uncles will not play political games with 
the SPDC, but will go about their business quietly, including 
opening a back channel to communicate with ASSK and other CEC 
members. 
 
5. (C) U Nyunt Wei reiterated an NLD position that the party 
would refuse to participate in the SPDC\'s reconvened National 
Convention (reftel).  \"We walked out in 1995 for good 
reason,\" he said, \"and our concerns still remain valid.\"  The 
SPDC\'s road map, said the Uncles, will not succeed.  U Hla Pe 
said that for the past 15 years the SPDC had harassed and 
intimidated the NLD, but now \"we face the worst situation 
possible\" in which the regime can indiscriminately \"do what 
they want,\" detaining NLD members and supporters without any 
warning or indication of their intent.  \"The Depeyin attack 
was our darkest moment,\" he said, \"and now the regime has 
physically split the party leadership in half.\" 
 
Keep Up the Pressure 
-------------------- 
 
6. (C) The NLD Uncles expressed full support for U.S. 
sanctions and international pressure, observing that these 
actions had secured their release.  They urged continued 
pressure, \"as a means to support the NLD\'s policy of change 
through non-violence\" and to help revive the NLD party\'s 
ability to operate.  Each of the Uncles expressed their 
desire to see the United Nations remain engaged in the 
political process and said they hoped the U.N. Security 
Council would address the situation in Burma.  The CEC 
members were pleased to learn from us that the UNGA Third 
Committee had adopted a tough resolution on Burma, including 
a call for a full and independent investigation of the May 30 
assault, but they observed that the SPDC is \"not the first 
government to ignore U.N. resolutions.\" 
 
7. (C) COM expressed strong support for the CEC leaders and 
briefed the Uncles on policy developments since their 
detention in June.  She noted that new U.S. sanctions had 
received overwhelming support from Congress and that the 
Administration remained focused on keeping up the pressure. 
She also told the Uncles that recent video footage of the NLD 
convoy, broadcast on November 28 by the BBC, had demonstrated 
to the world the phenomenal support that the democracy 
movement enjoys from the Burmese people.  COM also urged the 
Uncles to be realistic about expectations of UNSC action, 
given other, ongoing crises and opposition from some UNSC 
members.  U Than Tun replied to the latter point by asking 
\"How can we neutralize the Chinese?\"  We suggested as a 
starting point that the CEC members seek out a meeting with 
the Chinese Ambassador to exchange views. 
 
8. (C) We queried the elderly CEC members about plans for the 
future of the NLD party and how they intend to develop 
leaders from younger generations.  \"We don\'t need them,\" 
replied U Nyunt Wei, explaining that young NLD members want 
democracy, but were raised under Burmese socialism and \"know 
nothing about life and liberty.\"  The NLD leaders explained 
that the party and the CEC were formed in the midst of the 
1988 democracy demonstrations on a \"consensus\" basis and that 
the NLD\'s core leadership would continue to guide the party 
for the foreseeable future. 
 
Comment:  Change from Within or Without? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The released NLD CEC members are determined to remain 
politically active and to press ahead with reviving the 
democracy movement.  However, their immediate focus is on 
logistics, such as freeing ASSK and their other CEC 
colleagues and seeking to reopen party offices.  Without 
ASSK\'s direct leadership, however, the Uncles do not intend 
to implement any new party initiatives or develop a strategy 
to deal with an imminent National Convention and other SPDC 
actions.  The NLD Uncles see their hands as tied by ASSK\'s 
continued detention and may be hoping the answer to the 
political crisis lies in additional international pressure. 
\"We don\'t want more sanctions, we want you to invade,\" said U 
Nyunt Wei as we departed.  Though his smile indicated he may 
have been joking, like many Burmese, the CEC members may have 
diminishing hopes that internal efforts can ultimately thwart 
authoritarian rule.  End comment.

SUBJECT: WORLD AIDS DAY IN BURMA 
 
REF: RANGOON 1489 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  The GOB, close on the heels of its 
well-attended HIV/AIDS Exposition (reftel), on World AIDS Day 
held ceremonies and HIV/AIDS activities in Rangoon and other 
cities.  According to two government-controlled weeklies, the 
GOB ranks HIV/AIDS as the number three national health 
concern.  UNAIDS Country Coordinator expressed concerned that 
the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Burma is not given enough 
attention.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  The Ministry of Health held an indoor ceremony on 
December 1 in Rangoon attended by UN agencies\' staffs, INGOs, 
local NGOs, diplomats, and several hundred Ministry of Health 
civil servants.  The Ministry also held World AIDS Day 
ceremonies and awareness activities in other cities around 
the country.  The Deputy Minister of Health told the audience 
that Burma\'s strong cultural values have contributed to 
preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, and also help in the care 
of those infected, adding that the \"kind-hearted nature of 
the Burmese contributed to the care and support of PLWHA.\" 
The PM\'s wife, Dr. Daw Kin Win Shwe, also attended as the 
Head of the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association. 
 
3.  According to the UNAIDS Myanmar Country Coordinator the 
HIV infection rate is now 2.4 percent for the general Burmese 
population.  Using the Ministry of Health\'s HIV/AIDS data 
from testing army recruits (2 percent infection rate), blood 
donors (1.23 percent), and mothers giving birth (2.8 
percent), UNAIDS puts the infection rate for the general 
population above the 2 percent \"epidemic\" threshold.  Though 
the GOB figures are considered reliable, UNAIDS notes that 
because IV drug users are not counted, and the country\'s 
total population is unknown, and that since many expecting 
mothers don\'t use hospitals, finding a solid figure for 
infection rate is a bit of a red herring.  He felt instead 
that the focus should be on the HIV/AIDS incidence rate. 
 
4.  To coincide with World AIDS Day, the GOB-controlled 
weekly, \"The Myanmar Times\" cited HIV/AIDS as third among 
Burma\'s national health concerns after malaria and 
tuberculosis.  The article states that \"statistics from the 
National Blood Center in Yangon show that about one percent 
of the blood donors have HIV,\" that two thirds of the 
registered injection drug users have HIV, and that the GOB is 
promoting condom use to prevent heterosexual transmission. 
The GOB is also cooperating with the UN to \"tackle the 
problem of illicit drug use and HIV infection.\" 
 
5.  COMMENT:  The Rangoon ceremony, held entirely in English, 
and the rather candid article in the \"Times\" (which is read 
only by the expatriate community), appeared to be mostly 
window dressing designed specifically for foreign 
consumption.  The message to the UN, to foreign donors, and 
to the NGOs, is that the GOB is concerned about the HIV/AIDS 
problem in Burma, has taken steps to address the problem, and 
any assistance in fighting HIV/AIDS in Burma is welcome. 
Health care spending, however, tells a different story.  In 
2002 the GOB spent a paltry 14.2 cents per person on basic 
health care.  END COMMENT.

1.  (C) SUMMARY: According to Embassy sources, a secret SPDC 
court on November 28 sentenced to death nine persons, 
including a magazine editor and several individuals actively 
involved with opposition movements, for allegedly planning to 
assassinate regime leaders and bomb key government 
installations.  The SPDC denied the accused individuals legal 
representation during their trials and has made no official 
announcement regarding their death sentences, fueling local 
speculation that the GOB is using trumped up charges to send 
a message to detractors and would-be supporters of regime 
change. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C)  According to Embassy sources, on November 28 a 
special court at Rangoon\'s Insein prison sentenced nine 
people to death on charges of treason under Section 122 of 
the Burmese Penal Code.  In a late July sweep, military 
intelligence (MI) agents had arrested twelve individuals and 
accused them of being underground agents with connections to 
anti-SPDC exile groups and ethnic rebels.  The nine members 
of the group sentenced to death were also accused of planning 
to assassinate SPDC leaders by planting bombs at five sites 
around Rangoon on Martyrs Day (July 19). 
 
3. (C) Three individuals (Aung Lun, Myo Htwe, and Myo Chit) 
remain in detention without formal charges. The nine 
individuals sentenced to death (and brief bio information) 
are: 
 
--Thet Zaw (AKA Zaw Thet Htwe):  Chief editor of the sports 
magazine \"First Eleven\" and a former leader of the now-banned 
Democratic Party for New Society (DPNS). 
 
--Naing Min Kyi (AKA Min Hyi): Member of the New Mon State 
Party (NMSP). 
 
--Naing Yakkha (AKA Ne Win): Member of the NMSP youth wing. 
 
--Than Tun: Student activist. 
 
--Zar Naing Tun (AKA Phyu Lay). 
 
--Shwe Manh (AKA Zayar Oo). 
 
--Aye Myint: Attorney. 
 
--Zaw Myo Htet: Attorney and active leader of Mon National 
League for Democracy (MNLD). 
 
--Khabell (AKA Mya Sein): Sergeant with the Karen National 
Union (KNU). 
 
4. (U) Under Burmese law, those sentenced to death can appeal 
their cases to the High Court (formerly known as the Supreme 
Court).  As practiced under the current regime, the High 
Court will uphold the verdicts and refer them to the Head of 
State, SPDC Chairman Sr Gen Than Shwe.  However, the Senior 
General has never made a decision on a death penalty case, 
effectively leaving the prisoners in perpetual death row 
limbo.  Although there have been numerous death penalty cases 
in recent years (most recently, the high profile case of the 
son-in-law and grandchildren of former dictator Ne Win), the 
last person executed in Burma was army captain Ohn Kay Myint 
in the 1980s for planning a mutiny. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: In what has become an almost annual exercise, 
the SPDC arrests anti-SPDC activists and charges them with 
treason (in 2002, thirty were arrested during a single 
sweep).  MI makes a special effort to publicly link the 
accused with exiled opposition groups to give the appearance 
that the NLD and other domestic political parties are guilty 
by association.  While there are occasional signs of support 
for a violent overthrow of the regime, the SPDC has never 
held an open trial for alleged coup plotters or made 
available evidence of such plotting.  The sports magazine 
editor sentenced to death in the latest secret trial, Zaw 
Thet Htwe, ran afoul of the SPDC this summer when he 
published articles on the GOB\'s mishandling of 
foreign-donated funds to promote soccer in Burma.  END

1. (C) Summary:  The SPDC acknowledged on December 5 that it 
had recently released up to 16 NLD party members who had been 
detained in connection with the May 30 Depeyin attack.  By 
the regime\'s own admission, 14 individuals associated with 
the attack remain in detention.  The regime\'s decision to 
release more detainees is not purely humanitarian, but rather 
may be the result of a quiet dialogue with ASSK and/or an 
effort to ensure a warm reception at several upcoming 
international forums.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) During a December 5 press conference to unexpectedly 
announce new money laundering regulations (septel), the SPDC 
verified international press reports that the regime had 
released as many as 16 NLD party members.  The group of 16 
activists, all members of the NLD youth division, had 
provided security for ASSK and her convoy during a swing 
through northern Burma and were detained following the May 30 
Depeyin attack. 
 
3. (C) For the past six months, the 16 NLD members have been 
detained in Hkamti prison, a remote town in northern Sagaing 
Division, and were apparently released on December 2. 
According to NLD sources, however, the released party members 
are at the mercy of local government authorities for 
transportation out of their remote location and only a few 
have been able to contact their families.  As of December 5, 
the NLD was able to verify the release of only eight party 
members, but found credible the government\'s claim that a 
total of 16 had been released. 
 
4. (SBU) During the recent visit of U.N. Special Rapporteur 
Pinheiro (ref C), the human rights envoy pressed the SPDC for 
the release of 35 specific political detainees, most of whom 
were NLD party members detained in connection with the May 30 
convoy.  The regime released eight of the detainees on 
November 9 (ref B), leaving 27 on the Pinheiro-NLD list.  The 
SPDC now claims that with the latest release of 16 prisoners, 
only 14 individuals associated with the May 30 attack remain 
in detention.  By NLD calculations, which correspond with the 
SPDC figures, 11 party members are still held in Sagaing 
jails, including NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo, and three NLD 
CEC members remain under house arrest in Rangoon (U Lwin, U 
Aung Shwe, and Aung San Suu Kyi). 
 
5. (U) According to NLD sources, the following party youth 
members were released o/a December 2: 
 
--Myo Nyunt (Rangoon). 
 
--Myo Thaw, aka Ko Pauk (Rangoon). 
 
--Myint Kyaw (Rangoon). 
 
--Thet Tun (Rangoon). 
 
--Kwaw Zin Win (Irrawaddy). 
 
--Toe Lwin (Irrawaddy; believed to have suffered serious head 
injuries on May 30). 
 
--Min Lwin (Mandalay). 
 
--Myint Wai (unknown hometown). 
 
6. (U) According to NLD sources, the following party youth 
members were held at Hkamti prison and were likely among 
those released o/a December 2: 
 
--Tun Myint (Rangoon) 
 
--Than Tun (Rangoon) 
 
--Myo Zaw Aung (Mandalay) 
 
--Aung Naing (Mandalay) 
 
--Than Htay (Mandalay) 
 
--Aung Kyaw Oo (Mandalay) 
 
--Zaw Win Tun (Mandalay) 
 
--Kyaw Soe Linn (Mandalay) 
 
7.  (S) Comment:  The SPDC\'s motives for releasing NLD 
detainees (and issuing long-awaited money laundering 
regulations; septel) are clearly not humanitarian.  First, 
there are credible reports that ASSK has continued to press 
her SPDC interlocutors for the release of her colleagues, the 
reopening of NLD offices, and a full investigation of the May 
30 attack.  The regime may be trying to meet her part of the 
way in order to continue a quiet dialogue and head off a 
renewed public standoff, in which ASSK could regain regional 
sympathies.  Secondly, the regime is preparing to defend its 
road map for democracy at several upcoming forums, including 
the Japan-ASEAN summit in Tokyo December 11-12 and a 
Thai-sponsored Burma meeting on December 15.  Releasing NLD 
party members, who were the victims of a brutal attack, 
increases the likelihood of a warm reception at those venues.

1. (SBU) Summary: As if from thin air, the Burmese government 
has issued long-awaited regulations to accompany a money 
laundering law passed in June 2002.  Simultaneously, the 
government launched an investigation into two banks 
pinpointed by the United States as linked to 
narcotraffickers.  While we are cautiously optimistic, some 
omissions and obstacles remain and it is uncertain whether 
these new rules can and will be enforced effectively. End 
summary. 
 
Regulations from Heaven 
 
2. (U) Much to everyone\'s surprise, the Burmese government on 
December 5 released long-awaited regulations to accompany its 
June 2002 anti-money laundering statute.  It was the absence 
of these regulations, and the GOB\'s refusal to make any 
comment on their likely appearance, that in part led the 
Financial Action Task Force\'s (FATF) on November 3rd to ask 
member states to impose countermeasures on Burma. 
 
3. (U) The new regulations seem pretty good on paper.  They 
track the 2002 law very closely, requiring banks, land 
management agencies, and Customs to report on any suspicious 
or large transaction.  They also require Burma\'s Central 
Control Board (CCB) to form a Financial Investigation Unit 
(FIU) and oversee an elaborate administrative process for 
investigating and judging money laundering cases.  The 
regulations allow for temporary and permanent seizures of 
assets and lay out stiff penalties for money laundering 
associated with eleven criminal offenses, and for corruption 
of government and private agencies responsible for enforcing 
the law.  According to the Home Ministry, whose minister will 
chair the CCB, the regulations will be applied retroactively, 
and investigations of suspicious transactions dating back to 
June 2002 will begin once a FIU is up and running. 
 
4. (SBU) Though the regulations are a good start, there are a 
few things lacking and some potential problems.  For one, the 
regulations do not include a threshold amount for reporting 
transactions.  A Home Ministry official said this is 
\"expected,\" but without it the law will remain hobbled. 
Second, some crimes that are major arenas for money 
laundering, such as corruption and illegal gambling, are not 
included in the list of predicate offenses.  Third, the Home 
Ministry admits that Burma does not currently have the 
capacity to carry out effective investigations outside of 
narcotics-related money laundering.  For this last problem, 
the GOB blames a lack of resources and the international 
community\'s reluctance to offer significant assistance. 
 
On the Case 
 
5. (SBU) Notwithstanding the limited knowledge and experience 
of investigators, the GOB announced its first money 
laundering investigations will target Myanmar Mayflower and 
Asia Wealth banks.  Both of these private banks, with alleged 
ties to narcotraffickers, had been identified by the U.S. 
Treasury Department as being of particular money laundering 
concern.  Though it initially disputed the Treasury claims as 
\"spurious,\" in a later press conference the GOB cited the 
Treasury findings as the impetus for these inquiries (ref B). 
 The CCB has established an investigative body headed up by a 
well-educated, but firmly pro-SPDC, accountant.  Most of the 
rest of the team hails from various ministries. 
 
Comment: Wait and See 
 
6. (SBU) We don\'t know for sure why these regulations came 
out when they did and with no warning.  The Home Ministry 
claims it was just the natural course of events, but we doubt 
it.  None of the overt barriers to completing the regulations 
-- especially moribund private banks and the lack of capacity 
-- has been overcome since FATF made its final request for 
action to the Burmese government in October (ref C).  We 
think it more likely that the regulations were issued in 
their current state as a political gesture, to address FATF 
and U.S. pressure or perhaps to shine up the SPDC\'s 
reputation on the eve of Burma\'s two December summit meetings 
-- the Japan-ASEAN meetings and the Thai-hosted summit. 
 
7. (SBU) It is too early to know whether the regulations will 
be an effective deterrent to money laundering.  The capacity 
and will to enforce the rules properly is one question mark, 
and an area in which the United States and the UNODC could 
assist.  Another important unknown is whether the government 
can convince private bankers, currently decimated by an 
unresolved nearly year-old banking crisis, to systematically 
report on their dwindling customer base.  In a land where 
people go to extremes to avoid being noticed by the 
government, a vigilant banker may see his depositors flee to 
more lenient banks or into the large informal financial 
sector -- where monitoring and regulation will be nearly 
impossible.  Finally, corruption, as always, may take hold 
and erode effectiveness of the law.  End comment.

REF: RANGOON 1339 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Some clear themes emerged from a trip to the 
Burmese corner of the Golden Triangle.  The area\'s cities are 
relatively affluent, thanks to border trade.  However, this 
affluence, combined with low education levels, poor 
healthcare, and very little international attention, has 
helped this region to become a locus of social problems such 
as prostitution, HIV/AIDS, and trafficking of women.  Though 
the region is notorious for opium, it seems narcotics 
production is waning, though peddling and drug use remain a 
problem.  Finally, the increasing influence of China, to 
include a renminbi-denominated border economy, is a trend 
that will remain for the long term. End summary. 
 
Background: The Wild East 
 
2. (U) In an effort to assess the social and economic 
conditions in Burma\'s border regions, in early December two 
Embassy officers visited a mountainous corner of eastern Shan 
State, the country\'s largest administrative region, smack in 
the middle of the Golden Triangle near the Chinese, Thai, and 
Lao borders.  This part of Shan State is still primarily wild 
and inaccessible, with few roads and very little other 
infrastructure.  It is also a region with close ethnic ties 
to Thailand and China.  Though its largest single ethnic 
group is Akha, the majority of people are of various Tai 
subgroups or ethnic Chinese.  The area is also quite diverse 
religiously, with Christians comprising approximately 40 
percent of the population.  There is also a small Muslim 
community and many animists in the hills. 
 
3. (U) As with other border zones in Shan State (see reftel), 
this area of eastern Shan State -- made up of Kyaingtong, 
Tachileik, and Mongla townships -- relies far more on its 
foreign neighbors than on the Burmese regime in Rangoon.  The 
road west to the Shan capital of Taunggyi and the main 
Mandalay trade route is long and hard, passing through very 
rough, mountainous, and dangerous terrain.  The roads east to 
China and south to Thailand are, to the contrary, very good. 
Thus it is no surprise that it is its geographic, not legal, 
identity that defines this region.  In fact as we reached 
Mongla, the absence of ethnic Burmans, the almost exclusive 
use of spoken and written Mandarin, and the renminbi economy 
suggested that we had crossed the border into China. 
 
Affluence But Many Social Problems 
 
4. (U) Kyaingtong, the hub of the three townships, is more 
affluent than most towns of equivalent size elsewhere in 
Burma.  Tachileik, to the south, is the major point in Shan 
State for legal Thai-Burma border trade.  Although Mongla, to 
the northeast, is not yet an official China border trade 
crossing point, many products, primarily consumer goods, come 
in illicitly through the extremely porous and rugged 
frontier.  Farmers bringing their produce to market in 
Kyaingtong find they can get somewhat better prices because 
traders there are often buying for export to China and 
Thailand.  Likewise, border towns Tachileik and Mongla enjoy 
regular electricity and phone service, a luxury in the rest 
of Burma, purchased from over the border. 
 
5. (C) However, the region\'s comparative affluence, and 
proximity to international borders (which attract many 
jobless from around the country), combined with the region\'s 
remoteness, generally poor infrastructure, and low education 
levels have led to some serious social consequences. 
Religious, UN, and NGO officials all point to this Golden 
Triangle area as a hot zone for HIV/AIDS and trafficking in 
women.  Unfortunately, though, there has not yet been much 
international attention to this area.  A Catholic priest in 
Kyaingtong told us he had been unable to raise even US$10,000 
from international charities he\'d contacted for grassroots 
HIV/AIDS care and income generation projects to dissuade 
women from going to Thailand for sex work.  Currently only 
U.S.-based NGO World Vision and a skeleton UNDP office 
provide humanitarian aid out of Kyaingtong, and their 
operations were criticized by locals for having too much 
overhead and too little grassroots impact. 
 
6. (C) Anecdotes from community leaders in Kyaingtong and 
UNDP officials in Rangoon indicate that movement of young 
women, voluntarily or otherwise, through Tachileik into 
Thailand for sex work is a serious problem.  Interestingly, 
these girls are not primarily local, but originate from the 
poorest parts of Burma and travel or are trafficked to the 
Thai border area to work in brothels on both sides of the 
frontier.  Prostitution, and HIV/AIDS, are also present in 
Mongla, though the girls are generally imported from Yunnan 
Province.  The consensus was that the trafficking and 
prostitution situation would worsen if the Rangoon government 
continued to tighten border trade restrictions, hurting local 
economic prospects, and if the country\'s general economic 
situation continued to decline, enticing girls to make the 
long trek to look for work. 
 
Drug Free Zone? 
 
7. (C) Though the Golden Triangle region is historically 
notorious for cultivation of opium poppies, we heard mixed 
reports on the extent of current drug production and use. 
According to UN officials and local businessmen in Mongla, a 
boomtown built with drug proceeds in the mid-1990s, poppy 
cultivation in the immediate region has decreased and 
methamphetamines have not caught on.  Both pointed north, to 
the Wa region, when discussing current centers for opium and 
methamphetamine production.  However, community leaders in 
Kyaingtong asserted that drug use and peddling were a growing 
problem in town.  A Catholic priest noted he had expelled in 
2002 two boarders at his mission\'s orphanage for selling 
drugs in the dormitory.  The priest added that low-level drug 
pushing is an increasingly common fall-back profession for 
young men who lose their jobs in construction or trading. 
 
8. (SBU) Poppy-substitution agricultural projects, in early 
stages of development, were evident outside poverty stricken 
villages along the 60-mile Kyaingtong-Mongla road.  As in 
northeastern Shan State (reftel), the crops produced along 
this stretch (mangoes, rubber, lychees, and other cash crops) 
are destined for the Chinese market.  Other non-drug economic 
potential in the region is not so clear.  Mongla\'s 
incongruous and flashy casinos and hopping nightclubs are 
surely generating some cash, though not for locals since 
nearly all the employees in these joints are short-term 
Yunnanese migrants.  Furthermore, business is terrible 
because of a recent Chinese government effort to keep its 
citizens out of the casinos by limiting tourists to short day 
trips.  Thus hundreds of Chinese tourists per day visit Thai 
transvestite revues, a shocking pink anti-drug museum, a 
Thai-owned jade emporium, and an atrocious zoo, but are 
steered clear of the casinos.  We heard claims of other 
economic benefits coming from nearby jade and manganese 
mines, and an ore processing factory in Mongla -- though 
these seem marginal. 
 
Politics: Let\'s Just Make Money 
 
9. (C) There is an interesting political mixture in this 
region.  Though Kyaingtong and Tachileik have more dealings 
with China and Thailand, they are still ostensibly under the 
control of the Rangoon government and its military.  Mongla 
and the surrounding cease-fire-delineated Special Region 
Four, on the other hand, are squarely the domain of the 
National Democratic Alliance Army-Eastern Shan State 
(NDAA-ESS) and its long-time leader Lin Minxiang (aka U Sai 
Leun, aka U Sai Lin).  For the last thirty miles to the 
border, and throughout Mongla, we did not see a single 
Burmese government entity, including at the Chinese border 
checkpoint, other than a ramshackle immigration office in 
Mongla and two public schools.  In contrast, there was a 
modern, multi-story building housing the Chinese PLA border 
presence.  The Chinese operation was very professional in 
appearance, with several uniformed PLA soldiers in evidence 
on their side of the checkpoint, including one standing at 
attention on a raised dais. 
 
10. (C) The political temperature in both Kyaingtong and 
Mongla was low, with people focused more on border trade than 
politics in Rangoon.  Locals we approached were willing to 
speak openly and at length about regional economic and social 
conditions.  Religious affairs appeared in relatively good 
shape.  The Christian leaders with whom we spoke told us 
while they were officially constrained by Burma\'s 
pro-Buddhist regulations, they were nonetheless able to 
operate quite freely on the sly to renovate buildings, build 
small new structures, and provide religious education.  A 
priest told us that the Ministry of Religious Affairs had, a 
decade ago, even ruled in the Catholics\' favor in a boundary 
dispute with a neighboring Buddhist temple.  In the early 
morning hours we heard the call of the muezzin from 
Kyaingtong\'s mosque. 
 
11. (C) Our contacts had little to say about the upcoming 
SPDC-managed National Convention.  An FBIS-translated article 
from a Shan opposition group\'s news agency claimed that the 
leadership of Mongla was in a low-level dispute with Rangoon 
authorities over the make up of Special Region Four\'s 
delegation to the new Convention.  We also learned that in 
the first Convention in 1993 Mongla\'s delegation had pushed 
for autonomy.  However, the central government refused, 
citing an obscure regulation requiring an autonomous zone to 
have at least two townships -- Mongla has only one. 
Apparently this request will be raised again in the new 
Convention, though the same result is expected. 
 
Comment: The Long Arm of China 
 
12. (C) The most notable aspect of these trips to the Shan 
border is how quickly the bonds of central Burmese control 
are slipped, and how easily these ostensible Burmese towns 
identify with their foreign neighbors.  This is most 
noticeable in the ethnic cease-fire zones that have some 
legal autonomy.  However, even the towns under Burmese 
control -- like Kyaingtong, Tachileik, and Muse in the north 
-- identify osmotically with the booming markets across the 
border rather than the depressed markets of central and lower 
Burma.  This reality makes it clear that Rangoon\'s relations 
with ethnic groups along the border now and in the future 
will not just be about political-military issues, but also 
about economic influence.

1. (SBU) Summary: A new UN resident representative for Burma 
is attempting to complete a humanitarian needs assessment and 
strategy report that his predecessor failed to extract from 
the UN bureaucracy.  The report is intended to come alongside 
an ambitious data collection project, which should help focus 
limited international aid in the most vulnerable areas. 
While we welcome the UN\'s renewed effort, and hope to be 
pleasantly surprised, we are skeptical that these important 
reports will be produced on schedule and as planned.  End 
summary. 
 
Once More, With Feeling! 
 
2. (SBU) The new UN country team (UNCT) in Burma is trying 
again to issue a humanitarian needs assessment paper.  This 
paper, which is supposed to lay out an honest appraisal of 
the country\'s vulnerabilities and offer some proposed 
stakeholder responses, has been delayed for months reportedly 
due to UN internal bureaucratic wrangling. 
 
3. (SBU) An early draft of the second attempt at this report 
is quite similar to the last effort outlined in reftel and at 
the February Informal Consultative Group meeting on Burma. 
According to UNDP in Rangoon, when this draft is complete it 
will be used as a starting point for consultations with the 
GOB, NGOs, and donors.  After a background section, the 
report will look at the UN\'s current country operations, 
highlighting successes and also obstacles to efficiently 
providing assistance.  Next, for each of four broad areas of 
concern (poverty, social services, crime, and regional 
disparities), the report will outline the key systemic 
barriers to progress and suggest several, general, project 
proposals.  Finally, the report will address ways that the UN 
apparatus in Burma could work smarter; by bolstering internal 
and external coordination, expanding partnerships, and 
improving accountability and monitoring. 
 
4. (SBU) We\'ve learned from UN sources here that to help 
focus international efforts based on the humanitarian 
strategy paper the UNCT is also launching an ambitious, and 
long overdue, effort to accurately map socio-economic 
vulnerability throughout the country.  The consultants hired 
for this project will first review, with the assistance of 
NGOs and embassies, all existing data for standard indicators 
now used by UNDP to assess a country\'s humanitarian 
condition.  After the review, the UN will seek to fill data 
holes and upgrade any existing information that has not been 
verified.  The UNDP tells us this entire project should be 
complete by the end of February.  However, considering the 
lack of reliable data, and the UN\'s determination to do this 
work without soliciting GOB assistance, this may be wishful 
thinking. 
 
Needed: More Spine 
 
5. (SBU) We are skeptical that the new UNCT\'s plans and 
timetables will be as easily achieved as expected.  Accurate 
data collection will be difficult and time consuming without 
using government health, education, and agricultural 
officials around the country.  However, if asked to help, 
these officials will be reluctant at best to help collect 
information that would contradict the GOB\'s claims of a 
poverty-free, healthy, and well-fed and educated nation. 
Second, the UN here, apart from UNHCR, has a reputation for 
knuckling to GOB pressure and being reluctant to publish 
anything too brutally honest.  This reputation will have to 
be surmounted if any resulting report is to be credibly 
received and become the basis for any expanded international 
humanitarian efforts.

1. (C) A multilateral meeting on Burma, held December 15th in 
Bangkok, appears to have been a political victory for Burma\'s 
ruling regime.  Readouts of the meeting from Tokyo (ref A), 
Washington, and Bangkok indicate that there were some tough 
questions put to the Burmese representative, Foreign Minister 
Win Aung, but that the event was largely stage-managed to 
ensure maximum comfort for the Burmese representative.  For 
instance, supposedly all invitations to the event were first 
submitted to the Burmese government for veto.  By all 
accounts, FM Win Aung was able to blow off the tough 
questions but was given full rein to blow smoke on the 
country\'s \"uniquely\" troubled history, the status of Aung San 
Suu Kyi\'s (ASSK) detention and her participation in the 
pending National Constitutional Convention, and to \"explain\" 
Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt\'s 7-step \"road map to 
democracy\" (explored in detail in ref B). 
 
2. (C) Intentionally or not, this event will likely prove to 
be another shoulder chuck to the Burmese junta in its 
surprisingly successful campaign to bolster its international 
relations in the wake of its attack on ASSK in late May and 
the imposition of new U.S. sanctions in July and August.  The 
GOB\'s success winning over its neighbors and, eventually, 
ASEAN are well documented.  However, the attendance at the 
event of several non-Asian countries that have been critical 
of the regime\'s human rights abuses will give new confidence 
to the regime that it now has international, not just ASEAN, 
\"understanding\" (\"support\" is a luxury, not a necessity) to 
pursue the PM\'s \"road map\" at its own pace, in its own way, 
without undue pressure from abroad.  The GOB noted in a 
December 17 \"information\" sheet, responding to public U.S. 
skepticism of the \"road map\" process, that \"Support for the 
National Convention is strong in Myanmar, in the region, and 
even among groups which have long been opposed to the current 
government.\" 
 
3. (C) Other than this retort, there has been no announcement 
or briefing by the Burmese government on the Thai forum\'s 
outcome.  More surprisingly, there have been no propaganda 
pieces yet in the government\'s mouthpiece \"The New Light of 
Myanmar,\" though the December 18 edition of the 
semi-independent \"Myanmar Times\" included an article and 
photo from the Bangkok meeting.  In contrast, there was 
significant coverage in the \"New Light\" of PM Khin Nyunt\'s 
visit to Japan for the Japan-ASEAN summit meeting on December 
11-12, including several reprints of a smiley Khin Nyunt 
shaking hands with Japanese PM Koizumi.

I. Summary 
 
1.  Burma is the world\'s second largest producer of illicit 
opium and the second largest cultivator of opium poppy.  The 
gap between Burma and the number one producer of illicit 
opium and number one cultivator of poppy, Afghanistan, 
increased considerably in 2003.  Burma remains the primary 
source of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) in Asia, 
producing hundreds of millions of tablets annually. Although 
still a major producer of illicit opium, Burma\'s overall 
production in 2003 declined substantially for the seventh 
straight year. According to the joint U.S./Burma opium yield 
survey, opium production in Burma totaled no more than 484 
metric tons in 2003, down more than 23 percent from a year 
earlier, and a fraction of the 2,560 metric tons produced in 
Burma in 1996. Burma\'s opium is grown predominantly in Shan 
State, in areas controlled by former insurgent groups. Since 
the mid-1990s, however, the government has elicited 
\"opium-free\" pledges from each cease-fire group and, as these 
pledges have come due, has stepped up law enforcement 
activities in areas controlled by these groups. The ethnic Wa 
group in northeastern Shan State has pledged to end opium 
production and trafficking at the end of the 2005 poppy 
harvest, but the government has done little to curb its 
current cultivation and production activities. Wa cultivators 
now account for approximately 52 percent of Burma\'s total 
poppy crop.  Major Wa traffickers continue to operate with 
apparent impunity, and United Wa State Army (UWSA) 
involvement in methamphetamine production and trafficking 
remains a serious concern. During the 2003 drug certification 
process, the USG determined that Burma had \"failed 
demonstrably\" to meet its international counternarcotics 
obligations. 
 
2.  Over the past several years, the Burmese government has 
extended significantly its counternarcotics cooperation with 
other states. In 2001, it signed counternarcotics (Memoranda 
of Understanding) MOUs with both China and Thailand, and has 
joined with China in annual joint operations in the northern 
and eastern Shan State, which resulted in the destruction of 
several major drug trafficking rings, including a group that 
the Chinese called one of the largest \"armed drug smuggling 
groups in the Golden Triangle area.\"  Cooperation with 
Thailand increased considerably in 2003 as the Thai 
government pursued an aggressive domestic \"drug-free\" policy. 
 The Thai Prime Minister and other cabinet-level officials 
visited Burma in 2003 to discuss counterdrug cooperation with 
senior leaders of the Burmese military government. 
 
3.  The Burmese government released long-awaited money 
laundering regulations in December 2003.  These regulations 
are designed to allow implementation of a 2002 money 
laundering law which, in response to rising international 
concerns regarding the quality of its anti-money laundering 
regime, criminalized money laundering in connection with 
virtually every type of major criminal activity.   The new 
regulations lay out eleven predicate offenses including 
involvement in narcotics, human and arms trafficking, 
smuggling, counterfeiting, hijacking, cyber crime, illegal 
operation of a financial institution, and \"offenses committed 
by acts of terrorism.\"  Money laundering is punishable by 
imprisonment and the regulations will be applied 
retroactively to June 2002. 
 
4.  Burma is a party to the 1961 UN Single Convention, the 
1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 
UN Drug Convention. 
 
II. Status of Country 
 
5.  Burma is the world\'s second largest producer of illicit 
opium.  However, eradication efforts, enforcement of 
poppy-free zones, alternative development, and a shift toward 
synthetic drugs have combined to depress cultivation levels 
for the past three years.  2003 was the first year that 
weather was not a major factor in the declining poppy 
cultivation trend.  According to the joint U.S./Burma opium 
yield survey, the total land area under poppy cultivation in 
Burma was 47,130 hectares in 2003, a 39 percent decrease from 
the 77,700 hectares under cultivation in 2002. Estimated 
opium production in Burma totaled approximately 484 metric 
tons in 2003, a 23 percent decrease from 630 metric tons in 
2002, and less than one fifth of the 2,560 metric tons 
produced in Burma in 1996 (a 71 percent decline in eight 
years).  Although climate was not a factor in declining 
cultivation in 2003, improved weather conditions during 
critical growth periods did improve yields for the region\'s 
poppy farmers. In 2003, yields rose to 10.3 
kilograms/hectare, a substantial increase from the previous 
year (estimated at 8.1 kilograms/hectare) and a return to the 
robust yields of the early and mid-1990s though still less 
than the peak level recorded in 1996. 
 
6.  Burma also plays a major role in the regional traffic in 
amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  Drug gangs based in the 
Burma/China and Burma/Thailand border areas annually produce 
several hundred million methamphetamine tablets for markets 
in Thailand, China, and India on the basis of precursors 
imported from neighboring states.  Burma itself does not have 
a chemical industry and does not produce any of the 
precursors for methamphetamine or other artificial drugs. In 
2003 there were troubling signs that a nascent domestic 
market for ATS began to emerge in Burma, although 
deteriorating economic conditions will likely stifle 
significant growth in consumption.  During the first ten 
months of 2003, ATS seizures totaled less than 4 million 
tablets, a decline from previous modest levels of 
approximately 10 million tablets seized per year. Aside from 
these seizures, the government did not take significant steps 
to stop ATS production and trafficking.  Opium, heroin, and 
ATS are produced predominantly in Shan State, in areas 
controlled by former insurgent groups. Starting in 1989, the 
Burmese government negotiated a series of individual 
cease-fire agreements, allowing each group limited autonomy 
and a measure of development assistance in return for peace. 
Initially, these agreements permitted the former insurgents 
to continue their narcotics production and trafficking 
activities in relative freedom. Since the mid-1990s, however, 
the Burmese government has elicited \"opium-free\" pledges from 
each cease-fire group and, as these pledges have come due, 
has stepped up law-enforcement activities in the respective 
cease-fire territories.  Although virtually the entire opium 
crop is cultivated in the eastern Shan State, there is also 
minor and widely scattered cultivation in the States of Chin, 
Kachin, and Kayah and in Sagaing Division. 
 
7.  In 2003, the Burmese government continued its 
counternarcotics activities, primarily poppy crop 
eradication, in the Kokang region of northeastern Shan State 
controlled by Peng Jiasheng\'s Myanmar National Democratic 
Alliance Army (MNDAA), which had pledged to be opium-free by 
2000. The government applied only modest pressure on the Wa 
in 2003, claiming it cannot crack down faster because the 
Wa\'s opium-free pledge does not come due until the end of the 
2005 poppy harvest.  Premature action against the Wa, the 
government claims, would jeopardize Burma\'s national 
security, as the UWSA is a formidable military force.  Under 
the terms of the cease-fire agreements, the Wa and other 
groups involved in the drug trade are largely immune from 
government action. For instance, Burmese troops cannot enter 
Wa territory without permission from the UWSA and the GOB is 
unwilling to risk confronting the Wa, a potent organization 
with a well-manned and well-trained military force.. 
However, the government continued a more aggressive stance on 
its own travel in Wa territory, merely informing UWSA 
officials of such visits rather than seeking advance 
permission. Nevertheless, the government has yet to put 
significant pressure on the Wa to stop illicit drug 
production or trafficking. 
 
8.  UNODC and joint USG/GOB 2003 opium poppy survey results 
demonstrated partially effective enforcement of poppy-free 
zones, but may also indicate a shift toward synthetic drugs. 
Substitute crops and alternative development projects that 
would provide farmers economically viable alternatives to 
poppy cultivation have not replaced opium production and its 
profitability.  For regions to become truly drug free, the 
government must make a considerable commitment, assisted 
where possible by the international community, to undertake 
an extensive range of counternarcotics actions, including 
crop eradication, effective law enforcement, and alternative 
development. The government must foster cooperation between 
the government and the ethnic groups involved in drug 
production and trafficking, including the Wa, to eliminate 
poppy cultivation and opium production. 
 
9.  The GOB must also address the explosion of ATS that has 
flooded Thailand and is trafficked to other countries in the 
region. A domestic market for the consumption of ATS also 
emerged in Burma, a disturbing trend that, although less 
significant that other societal woes, could prove to be a 
destabilizing factor in the long-term.  The UNODC estimated 
that in 2003 there were at least 15,000 regular ATS users in 
Burma. The GOB must make a firm commitment and a concerted 
effort to stop production of ATS by gaining support and 
cooperation from the ethnic groups, including the Wa, 
involved in ATS, as well as through closing production labs 
and preventing the diversion of precursor chemicals needed to 
produce synthetic drugs.  No ATS labs were reported destroyed 
in 2003. 
 
10.  Burma has a small, but growing drug abuse problem. While 
the government maintains that there are only about 70,000 
registered addicts in Burma, surveys conducted by UNODC, 
among others, suggest that the addict population could be as 
high as 300,000 (i.e. still less than 1 percent of the 
population), with opium the major source of addiction 
(135,000 regular users of heroin, including up to 30,000 
intravenous drug users).  Recreational use of illicit drugs, 
including ATS, is on the rise.  There is also a growing 
HIV/AIDS epidemic, linked in part to intravenous drug use. 
According to surveys, 57 percent of all intravenous drug 
users in Burma have tested positive for the HIV/AIDS virus. 
Infection rates are highest in Burma\'s ethnic regions, and 
specifically among mining communities in those areas, where 
opium, heroin, and ATS are readily available. 
 
11.  Money laundering is also an area of concern. In November 
2003 the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) called upon 
member countries to impose countermeasures against Burma for 
its failure to pass a mutual legal assistance law and its 
failure to issue regulations to accompany the \"Control of 
Money Laundering Law\" passed in 2002.  Burma responded by 
releasing new money laundering regulations on December 5, 
2003, but has yet to address the mutual legal assistance law 
issue. 
 
III. Country Actions Against Drugs in 2003 
 
 
12.  Policy Initiatives. Burma\'s official 15-year 
counternarcotics plan calls for the eradication of all 
narcotics production and trafficking by 2014, one year ahead 
of an ASEAN-wide plan of action that calls for the region to 
be drug-free by 2015 . The plan is to proceed by stages, with 
eradication efforts coupled to alternative development 
programs in individual townships, predominantly in Shan 
State.  Altogether, the GOB identified 54 townships for the 
programs and targeted  25 of them during the first five years 
of the program. 
 
13.  The government has received limited international 
assistance in support of these efforts. The most significant 
multilateral effort is the UN Office of Drugs and Crime\'s 
(UNODC) Wa Alternative Development Project (WADP), which is 
financed by the United States, Japan, and Germany. A 
five-year, $12.1 million program, this supply-reduction 
project encourages alternative development in a small portion 
of the territory controlled by the United Wa State Army. 
UNODC extended the project from 2003 until 2005 and expanded 
the number of villages targeted for community development 
work from 4 to 16.  Also in 2003, the UNODC and the Japanese 
government announced plans to establish an intervention in 
the Wa and Kokang areas (dubbed \"KOWI\") aimed at supporting 
the humanitarian needs of farmers who have abandoned poppy 
cultivation.  A joint humanitarian assessment, consisting of 
UN agencies and NGOs, traveled to the Kokang and Wa areas 
earlier in the year and concluded that farmers had lost up to 
70 percent of their income and were increasingly susceptible 
to disease, internal displacement, and food insecurity. 
Several international NGOs have partnered with the UNODC, and 
Japan and Italy were early donors. 
 
14.  Bilateral counternarcotics projects include a small, 
U.S.-financed project in northern Shan State (Project Old 
Soldier) and a substantial Japanese effort to establish 
buckwheat as a cash crop in the Kokang and Mong Ko regions of 
northeastern Shan State. The Thai government has since 2001 
extended its own alternative development projects across the 
border into the Wa-controlled Southern Military Region of 
Shan State. 
 
15.  Burma hosted several multilateral counterdrug meetings 
in 2003, including a precursor control meeting in January 
with India, China, and UNODC; a precursor control meeting in 
July with India, China, Thailand and Laos; and, in October, 
the law enforcement task force of the ASEAN and China 
Cooperative Operations in Response to Dangerous Drugs 
(ACCORD).  Burma also participated in a Mekong fact-finding 
survey in July with China, Laos, and Thailand and a precursor 
control meeting in Thailand that included India, China, Laos, 
and Thailand.  The five countries agreed on cross-border 
cooperation to stop the flow of precursor chemicals among the 
countries of the Mekong river sub-region. 
 
16.  The Government of Burma supported a UNODC effort in 2001 
to form a \"Civil Society Initiative\" (CSI) to conduct 
awareness activities and programs regarding the dangers of 
drug abuse and HIV/AIDs.  The CSI, which partnered with NGOs 
and local celebrities, held a successful anti-drug concert 
and marathon in 2002.  However, the GOB failed to support a 
two-day anti-drug music festival in 2003, which was 
subsequently canceled. 
 
17.  Narcotics Seizures:   Summary statistics provided by 
Burmese drug officials indicate that during the first ten 
months of 2003 Burmese police, army, and the Customs Service 
together seized approximately 1,247 kilograms of raw opium, 
488 kilograms of heroin, 78 kilograms of marijuana, 102 
kilograms of methamphetamine powder, 156 kilograms of 
morphine, and 4.5 million methamphetamine pills.  This 
compares with seizures during all of 2002 of 1,631 kilograms 
of raw opium, 285 kilograms of heroin, and 8.8 million 
methamphetamine pills.   Heroin seizures, almost double the 
previous year, were at the highest levels since 1997. 
Seizures of ATS in 2003 continued a downward trend and may be 
related to adjustments in trafficking patterns or to 
Thailand\'s aggressive 2003 \"drug free\" policy, which greatly 
reduced the market for Burma-produced ATS, at least in the 
short-term.  The relatively tiny amount of ATS seized (less 
than 4 million tablets) had no effect on the scope of the 
growing problem. 
 
18.  The Ministry of Health identifies 25 substances as 
precursor chemicals and prohibits their import, sale, or use 
in Burma.  Seizures of precursor chemicals declined 
substantially during the first ten months of 2003 and 
included 266 kilos of ephedrine, 2,540 liters of acetic 
anhydride, and 37,557 liters of other precursor chemicals. In 
2002, the first year the GOB issued a notification 
identifying illegal precursor chemicals, the totals were 
substantially higher: 3,922 kilos of ephedrine, 12,318 liters 
of acetic anhydride, and 174,191 liters of other chemicals. 
 
19. Major cases in 2003: 
 
-- In cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA), police in India, China, Canada, and 
Burma contributed to the arrest of a total of thirty 
narcotics suspects in all five countries and the seizure of 
approximately 36 kilograms of heroin and one ATS laboratory. 
-- In cooperation with China, Burmese police contributed to a 
series of arrests and seizures throughout 2003 along the 
Chinese border.  Since 2001, Burma has turned over 22 
fugitives to China, including members of one group (Tan Xiao 
Lin and company), which China described as the \"largest armed 
drug-trafficking gang in the Golden Triangle.\" 
 
-- During a nine-day operation at the end of March near 
Taunggyi in western Shan State, Burmese authorities seized 
68.6 kilograms of morphine, 42 kilograms of opium, 720 liters 
of precursor chemicals, and a cache of weapons and ammunition. 
 
-- On February 1, 2003, Burmese authorities located and 
dismantled a clandestine heroin refinery near Kutkai 
township.  A search of the site revealed 404 liters of ethyl 
alcohol and other precursors and drug production 
paraphernalia. 
 
-- On July  17, 2003, Burmese authorities located and 
dismantled a clandestine heroin refinery near Kutkai 
township.  A search of the site revealed 6 kilograms of 
morphine, 86.2 liters of ether, 229.64 liters of other 
precursor chemicals, and several weapons. 
 
-- On July 19, 2003, Burmese authorities located and 
dismantled a clandestine heroin refinery near Theinni 
township.  A search of the site revealed 10.28 kilograms of 
opium, 5.6 kilograms of heroin, 141.96 kilograms of poppy 
seeds, and 1,795.7 liters of precursor chemicals. 
Authorities arrested five suspects. 
 
-- On July 31, 2003, Burmese authorities located and 
dismantled a clandestine heroin refinery near Kutkai 
township.  A search of the site resulted in the seizure of 
36.4 kilograms of opium, 62.45 kilograms of heroin, 2352.6 
liters of ether, 3102.6 liters of chloroform, and a cache of 
weapons and ammunition. 
 
-- On August 1, 2003, Burmese authorities in Mandalay seized 
approximately 153 kilograms of ephedrine and arrested two 
suspects. 
 
-- On August 21, 2003, Burmese authorities seized 
approximately 529,800 methamphetamine tablets, a cache of 
weapons, and ammunition and arrested one suspect. 
 
-  On August 24, 2003 Burmese police cooperated with Thai 
authorities in Chiang Mai, Thailand on the seizure of 500,000 
methamphetamine tablets, four firearms, and three suspects 
(the three suspected drug traffickers died while in 
detention). 
 
20.  Arrests and Prosecutions:  In 2003, Burma arrested 3,336 
suspects on drug related charges, according to official 
statistics.  In addition, the GOB arrested nine United W 
State Army (UWSA) officers in August 2003. 
 
21.  Refineries. The government dismantled 7 heroin labs 
through the first ten months of 2003, compared to 17 from the 
entire previous year.  The GOB destroyed no meth labs in 
2003, although 6 were destroyed in 2002. 
 
22.  Eradication. The government eradicated more than 21,000 
hectares (51,892 acres) of opium poppy over the past three 
crop years.  However, only 683 hectares were destroyed during 
the 2002/03 crop year, a mere fraction of the 10,466 hectares 
destroyed during the 2001/02 crop year and the 10,568 
hectares destroyed during the 2000/01 crop year. 
Nonetheless, overall eradication accounts for almost 
one-third of the reduction in area under poppy cultivation 
since 2001.  In addition, during the first ten months of 2003 
the government burned 164,000 kilos of poppy seeds capable of 
seeding more than 40,570 hectares (100,250 acres). The 
destruction of those seeds, together with law enforcement 
actions, reduced the area under opium cultivation by more 
than one third in 2003. 
Law Enforcement Measures. The Central Committee for Drug 
Abuse Control (CCDAC)--which is comprised of personnel from 
various security services, including the police, customs, 
military intelligence, and the army-leads drug-enforcement 
efforts in Burma.  CCDAC now has 18 drug-enforcement task 
forces around the country, with most located in major cities 
and along key transit routes near Burma\'s borders with China, 
India, and Thailand.  As is the case with most Burmese 
government entities, CCDAC suffers badly from a lack of 
adequate resources to support its law-enforcement mission. 
 
23.  Burma\'s 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 
Law provide the legal framework for the country\'s law 
enforcement efforts. As demanded by the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, that law contains legal tools for addressing 
narcotics-related money laundering, the seizure of 
drug-related assets, and the prosecution of drug conspiracy 
cases.  The State Peace and Development Council passed a 
broader \"Control of Money Laundering Law\" in 2002 and in 
December 2003 issued regulations to implement the law. 
 
24.  In November 2003, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 
called upon member countries to impose countermeasures 
against Burma for its failure, among other shortcomings, to 
issue regulations to implement its 2002 money laundering 
statute or to pass a mutual legal assistance law.  With 
assistance from UNODC, the Burmese government is in the 
process of drafting a legal assistance law and, if passed and 
enacted, could create a framework for judicial and law 
enforcement cooperation across borders in the prosecution of 
money laundering and other cases. 
 
25.  In 2002, the government, having established a police and 
military intelligence presence in the ethnic Wa territories, 
demanded that the Wa, the Kokang Chinese, and other 
cease-fire groups issue new counternarcotics decrees. Those 
decrees outlawed participation in any aspect of the narcotics 
trade. The GOB also demanded and received cooperation from 
the UWSA in bringing to heel several major fugitives wanted 
by China. In addition, it has closed down the liaison offices 
of armed groups like the UWSA, and of companies associated 
with those groups in Tachileik, Myawaddy, and other towns on 
the Thai/Burmese border.  In December 2003, the GOB announced 
an investigation of two private banks associated with the Wa 
(Asia Wealth and Myanmar Mayflower), identified by the United 
States as entities of \"primary money laundering concern.\" 
 
26.  The GOB continued efforts to hold cease-fire groups to 
their pledges to end opium production in their territories. U 
Sai Lin\'s Special Region No. 4 around Mong La has been 
opium-free since 1997 and the Wa are maintaining their pledge 
to eliminate opium by the end of the 2005 harvest.  However, 
according to the 2003 joint U.S./Burma opium yield survey, 
poppy cultivation increased in the Wa Special Region by over 
5,500 hectares and the area now accounts for 52 percent of 
Burma\'s total poppy crop.  The Kokang Chinese missed their 
opium-free target (scheduled for the year 2000), and extended 
their deadline to 2003.  Although much of the opium crop has 
now been eliminated, the Kokang paid a heavy price in terms 
of increased attention from both the Burmese and the Chinese 
police. Several of the ethnic trafficking armies also control 
amphetamine production labs and extensive trafficking 
operations. These remain largely intact and are a major 
factor in amphetamine trafficking in Southeast Asia and 
beyond. 
 
27.  The government continued its crackdown begun in 2001 on 
the array of militias (some government-sponsored village 
defense forces, and others the remnants of former insurgent 
bands) that the government had previously allowed to 
cultivate opium in the Kutkai-Lashio region of northern Shan 
State. According to military intelligence officials, with 
peace now prevailing in most of the countryside and the 
government no longer in need of the local security services 
these groups provided, steps are now being taken to slowly 
scale back their privileges, including the right to grow and 
traffic in opium. 
 
28.  In 2003, for the third-consecutive year, Burma\'s opium 
poppy crop declined.  The latest crop was 36 percent below 
the previous year\'s level and the smallest crop in ten years. 
 According to USG imagery-based estimates, about 47,130 
hectares of crop was cultivated during the 2002-2003 growing 
seasons, down from 77,700 in 2001-2002.  2003 was also the 
first year that weather was not a major factor accelerating 
the drop in cultivation level.  Sources of the large decline 
included law enforcement, a conscious shift away from opium 
to synthetic drugs by the region\'s drug lords, and localized 
alternative development success. 
 
29.  Corruption. There is no reliable evidence that senior 
officials in the Burmese Government are directly involved in 
the drug trade. However, lower level officials, particularly 
army and police personnel posted in outlying areas, have been 
prosecuted for drug abuse and/or narcotics-related 
corruption. According to the Burmese government, over 200 
police officials and 48 Burmese Army personnel were punished 
for narcotics-related corruption or drug abuse between 1995 
and 2003.  Of the 200 police officers, 130 were imprisoned, 
16 were dismissed from the service, 7 were forced to retire, 
and 47 were demoted. No Burma Army officer over the rank of 
full Colonel has ever been prosecuted for drug offenses in 
Burma. This fact, the prominent role in Burma of notorious 
narcotics traffickers (e.g. the Lo Hsing Han clan, Khun Sa, 
Wei Hsueh Kang, etc.), and the continuance of large-scale 
narcotics trafficking over years of intrusive military rule 
have given rise to speculation that some senior military 
leaders protect or are otherwise involved with narcotics 
traffickers. 
 
30.  Agreements and Treaties. Burma is a party to the 1961 UN 
Single Convention, the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic 
Substances, and the 1988 UN Drug Convention. In September 
2003 the amended 1971 UN Protocol on Psychotropic Substances 
took effect in Burma.  In addition, Burma is also one of six 
nations (Burma, Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam) 
that are parties to UNODC\'s sub-regional action plan for 
controlling precursor chemicals and reducing illicit 
narcotics production and trafficking in the highlands of 
Southeast Asia. 
In 2003, the Chinese and Thai governments stepped up 
bilateral counterdrug cooperation efforts with Burma and, 
with the GOB, established joint Border Liaison Offices (BLO) 
along their respective borders to facilitate the sharing of 
intelligence. 
 
31.  Cooperation with Thailand in particular increased 
considerably in 2003 as the Thai government pursued an 
aggressive domestic \"drug-free\" policy.  Thai cabinet-level 
officials visited Burma several times during the year to 
discuss counterdrug cooperation with senior leaders of the 
Burmese military government.  Burma\'s 2001 MOU with Thailand 
commits both countries to closer police cooperation in 
narcotics control and they subsequently established joint 
\"narcotics suppression coordination stations\" in the Chiang 
Rai/Tachileik, Mae Sot/Myawaddy, and Ranong/Kawthoung border 
areas. In addition, Thailand implemented a 20 million baht 
(about $440,000) new alternative development program in the 
Southern Military Region of Shan State, which is now occupied 
by the United Wa State Army. In December, the Burmese and 
Thai Prime Ministers met in Shan State to review the project 
and to discuss counternarcotics cooperation, 
 
32.  While not formally funding alternative development 
programs, the Chinese government has encouraged investment in 
many projects in the Wa area, particularly in commercial 
enterprises such as tea plantations and pig farms and has 
assisted in marketing those products in China through 
relaxation of duty taxes. 
 
33.  Cultivation and Production. According to the 2003 
U.S./Burma Joint Opium Yield Survey, opium production 
declined in Burma for the seventh straight year. The survey 
found that the maximum potential yield for opium in Burma in 
2003 totaled 484 metric tons, down 146 metric tons (or 
approximately 23 percent) from 2002. Over the past seven 
years, opium production in Burma has declined by more than 81 
percent, from an estimated 2,560 metric tons in the peak year 
of 1996 to 484 metric tons in 2003. The area under 
cultivation has dropped by almost two-thirds, from 163,100 
hectares in 1996 to approximately 47,130 hectares in 2003. 
Yields have similarly been reduced, from an estimated 17 
kilograms per hectare in 1996 to about 10.3 kilograms per 
hectare in 2003.  However, the 2003 opium/hectare yield rate 
increased by about 18 percent from the previous year, 
reflecting favorable weather and more intense cultivation in 
Wa areas. 
 
34.  Results from a UNODC-sponsored census survey throughout 
Shan State in 2003 largely corroborated the results of the 
U.S./Burma Joint Opium Yield Survey.  According to UNODC, the 
area under poppy cultivation in 2003 declined by 23 percent 
from the previous year and by 62 percent since 1996. For its 
2003-04 opium survey, the UNODC\'s Illicit Crop Monitoring 
Program (ICMP) will be extended to cover areas in Kachin and 
Chin States and Sagaing Division, in addition to the entire 
Shan State. 
 
35.  Drug Flow/Transit. Most ATS and heroin in Burma is 
produced in small, mobile labs located in the Burma/China and 
Burma/Thailand border areas, primarily in territories 
controlled by active or former insurgent groups. A growing 
amount of methamphetamine is reportedly produced in labs 
co-located with heroin refineries in areas controlled by the 
United Wa State Army (UWSA), the Kokang Chinese, and the Shan 
State Army-South (SSA-S). Heroin and methamphetamine produced 
by these groups are trafficked primarily through China, 
Thailand, India and, to a lesser extent, Laos,  Bangladesh, 
and Burma itself. 
 
36.  Precursors for refining these narcotic drugs are 
primarily produced in India, China, and Thailand. Burma does 
not have a chemical industry and does not produce ephedrine, 
acetic anhydride, or any of the other chemicals required for 
the narcotics trade. Similarly, the major markets for all of 
these narcotic drugs lie in neighboring states. However, 
there were signs in 2003 that Burma\'s small domestic market 
for drug consumption grew, especially the consumption of ATS. 
 
 
37.  Demand Reduction. The overall level of drug abuse is low 
in Burma compared with neighboring countries. According to 
the GOB, there are only about 70,000 \"officially registered\" 
drug abusers in Burma.  This is undoubtedly an underestimate, 
and even the UNODC estimates that there may be no more than 
300,000 people (still less than 1 percent of the population) 
who abuse drugs in Burma. Most, particularly among the older 
generation, use opium, but use of heroin and synthetic drugs 
is rising, particularly in urban and mining areas.  NGOs and 
community leaders reported growing numbers of disaffected 
youth using heroin and ATS, particularly in ethnic minority 
areas. 
 
38.  Burmese demand reduction programs are in part coercive 
and in part voluntary. Addicts are required to register with 
the GOB and can be prosecuted if they fail to register and 
accept treatment. Altogether, more than 21,000 addicts were 
prosecuted for failing to register between 1994 and 2003 
Demand reduction programs and facilities are strictly 
limited, however. There are six major drug treatment centers 
under the Ministry of Health, 49 other smaller detox centers, 
and eight rehabilitation centers which, together, have 
reportedly provided treatment to about 55,000 addicts (UPDATE 
to include 2003 figures) over the past ten years. There are 
also a variety of narcotics awareness programs conducted 
through the public school system. According to UNODC, 
approximately 1,200 high school teachers participated in 
seminars, training programs, and workshops connected with 
these programs in 2001. In addition, the government has 
established demand reduction programs in cooperation with 
NGOs. These include programs with CARE Myanmar, World 
Concern, and Population Services International (PSI), all of 
which focus on injecting drug use as a factor in the spread 
of HIV/AIDS. 
 
IV. U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs 
 
39.  Policy and Programs. The USG has suspended direct 
counternarcotics assistance to Burma since 1988, when the 
Burmese military began its suppression of the pro-democracy 
movement. The USG now engages the Burmese government in 
regard to narcotics control only on a very limited level. 
DEA, through the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon, shares drug-related 
intelligence with the GOB and conducts joint drug-enforcement 
investigations with Burmese counternarcotics authorities. 
Other U.S. agencies conducted opium yield surveys in the 
mountainous regions of the Shan State in 1993 and 1995 and 
annually from 1997 through 2003 with essential assistance 
provided by Burmese counterparts. These surveys give both 
governments an accurate understanding of the scope, 
magnitude, and changing geographic distribution of Burma\'s 
opium crop. 
 
40.  The U.S. Government regularly urges the Burmese 
government to take additional steps to curb narcotics 
production and trafficking. Specifically, the USG has 
encouraged the Burmese government to: 
 
-- Comply with the provisions of UN Drug Conventions by 
taking demonstrable and verifiable actions against high level 
drug traffickers and their organizations; 
 
-- Increase opium eradication and significantly increase 
seizure rates for opium, heroin, and methamphetamines; 
control the diversion of precursor chemicals; and destroy 
significantly more heroin and methamphetamine laboratories; 
 
-- Continue cooperation with China and Thailand and expand 
cooperation to other neighboring countries such as India; 
 
-- Enforce existing money laundering laws, including asset 
forfeiture provisions, and fully implement and enforce 
Burma\'s new money laundering legislation; 
 
-- Prosecute drug-related corruption, especially corrupt 
government and military officials who facilitate drug 
trafficking and money laundering; and 
 
-- Expand demand reduction, prevention, and drug treatment 
programs to reduce drug use and control the spread of 
HIV/AIDS. 
 
41.  The Road Ahead. The Burmese government has committed 
itself in recent years to expanded counternarcotics measures 
and has made significant gains in reducing opium poppy 
cultivation and opium production. The GOB has enlisted major 
regional allies (particularly China and Thailand) in this 
fight, and has built up the capacity to identify and punish 
drug traffickers and major trafficking organizations, even 
within the context of very limited resources. Based on 
experience in dealing with significant narcotics-trafficking 
problems elsewhere in the world, the USG recognizes that 
large-scale and long-term international aid-including 
development assistance and law-enforcement aid-would help 
curb drug production and trafficking in Burma. However, 
recurring human rights problems have limited international 
support of all kinds, including support for Burma\'s law 
enforcement efforts. 
 
42.  The USG believes that the Government of Burma should 
continue to reduce opium cultivation and production, combat 
corruption, enforce its narcotics and money-laundering 
legislation, and deal with drug abuse. Its efforts to date 
have produced measurable results. The USG strongly urges the 
GOB to sustain and intensify those efforts so that its 
counternarcotics efforts are commensurate with the scope of 
the problem. The USG also urges the GOB to take efforts to 
combat the production and trafficking of ATS and to stem the 
growth of a domestic market for the consumption ATS before 
this problem becomes more significant. Burma should expand 
its law-enforcement campaign to the most prominent 
trafficking groups and their leaders. In addition, the USG 
encourages the GOB to continue its expanded efforts to 
cooperate with other countries in the region. Continued and 
intensified, these efforts could lead to a sustained 
reduction in all forms of narcotics production and 
trafficking from an area that has been one of the world\'s 
major drug trafficking centers. 
 
43. Statistical information: Tables e-mailed to INL/AAE and 
EAP/BCLTV on 12/19/03. 
 
Financial Crimes/Money Laundering 
 
Suspicious activity reports: 
 
44.  Burma. (For UPDATE in Washington). An analysis by FinCEN 
of the Suspicious Activity Reporting System, for the period 
January 1, 2002 to October 31, 2002, revealed that there were 
eight SARs that could be linked to transactions associated 
with Burma. Most of the reported activity involved suspicious 
wire transfer activity to or from Burma or involved a citizen 
of Burma. SARs reported wire transfers originating in Tokyo, 
Hong Kong, and Singapore flowing into the United States and 
sent by individuals using Burmese passports for 
identification. Banks identified the activity as suspicious 
due to a lack of information linking the activity to 
legitimate funds. Additional activity reported on the SARs 
included structured cash deposits made by Burmese citizens in 
an apparent attempt to avoid BSA filing requirements. 
 
45.  Burma. Renamed the Union of Myanmar by its ruling junta, 
Burma has a mixed economy with substantial state-controlled 
activity--mainly in energy, heavy industry, and forestry--and 
with private activity dominant in agriculture, light 
industry, and transport. Burma\'s economy continues to be 
vulnerable to drug money laundering due to its 
under-regulated financial system, weak anti-money laundering 
regime, and policies that facilitate the funneling of drug 
money into commercial enterprises and infrastructure 
investment. 
 
46.  On November 3, 2003, the Financial Action Task Force 
(FATF) called upon member countries, including the United 
States, to impose countermeasures against Burma for its 
failure to pass a mutual legal assistance law and to issue 
regulations to accompany the June 2002 \"Control of Money 
Laundering Law\" (State Peace and Development Council Law No. 
6/2002).  The United States took immediate action on FATF\'s 
request, issuing on November 18 two proposed rules that would 
declare Burma, and two private banks (Asia Wealth and Myanmar 
Mayflower) entities of \"primary money laundering concern.\" 
 
47.  When adopted, the rules, to be issued pursuant to the 
2001 USA PATRIOT Act, will \"prohibit covered financial 
institutions from establishing, maintaining, administering, 
or managing in the United States any correspondent or 
payable-through account for, or on behalf of\", the two named 
banks or any other Burmese financial institution.  The rules 
will also prohibit any correspondent account maintained for 
any foreign bank if the account is used to provide banking 
services indirectly to the two named banks or any other 
Burmese financial institution.  The U.S. Treasury Department, 
under existing sanctions, already advises U.S. financial 
institutions to give enhanced scrutiny to all financial 
transactions relating to Burma. 
 
48.  Unexpectedly, and perhaps in response to FATF pressure, 
the Burmese government released the long-awaited money 
laundering regulations on December 5, 2003.  The regulations 
track closely with the 2002 law and, on paper, create many of 
the tools necessary for gains in addressing money laundering. 
 The regulations lay out eleven predicate offenses including 
narcotics activities, human and arms trafficking, smuggling, 
counterfeiting, hijacking, cyber crime, illegally operating a 
financial institution, and \"offenses committed by acts of 
terrorism.\" 
 
49.  Burma\'s 1993 Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 
Law only criminalized narcotics-related money laundering. 
The December 2003 regulations are more comprehensive and 
reprise the 1993 law\'s requirement of suspicious transaction 
reporting for banks, realtors, and customs officials.  The 
new regulations also impose severe penalties for 
transgressors of the law, but do not yet set a threshold 
limit or include a specific timetable for required submission 
of suspicious transaction reports (STRs), beyond \"without 
delay.\"    Money laundering is punishable by imprisonment, 
and the regulations will be applied retroactively to June 
2002 once threshold amounts are established. 
 
50.  The 2003 money-laundering regulations task the 
government\'s Central Control Board on Money Laundering to 
form the Burmese Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which may 
conduct investigations into money laundering cases based on 
STRs.  The Central Control Board, chaired by the Minister for 
Home Affairs, will enforce the legislation.  The Board will 
set policy, direct the Investigation Body (that performs 
money laundering investigations and conducts seizures), 
direct the Preliminary Scrutiny Body (that ensures due 
process and finalizes the case), cooperate with other 
international money laundering groups, and organize 
investigation teams.  The legislation provides full access to 
all financial records for investigators from the FIU.  The 
UNODC is assisting the Burmese government in its efforts to 
draft a mutual legal assistance framework. 
 
51.  Burma is an observer jurisdiction to the Asia/Pacific 
Group on Money Laundering and a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention.  Over the past several years, the Government of 
Burma (GOB) has significantly extended its counternarcotics 
cooperation with other states.  The GOB has bilateral drug 
control agreements with India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Russia, 
Laos, the Philippines, China, and Thailand.  In 2002-2003, 
Burma expanded cooperation with Thailand and China to jointly 
combat trafficking in drugs and precursor chemicals in 
northern and eastern Shan State.  Burma has signed, but not 
yet ratified, the UN International Convention for the 
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (CONFIRM).  Burma 
has not signed or ratified the UN Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, which entered into force on 
September 29, 2003.  Currently, Burma does not provide 
significant mutual legal assistance or cooperation to 
overseas jurisdictions in the investigation and prosecution 
of serious crimes. 
 
52.  Burma must increase the regulation and oversight of its 
banking system, and end policies that facilitate the 
investment of drug money in the legitimate economy.  Burma 
should ensure its money laundering law is enforced fairly and 
thoroughly.  The GOB should also criminalize the financing 
and support of terrorism.  Burma should provide the necessary 
resources to the administrative and judicial authorities that 
supervise the financial sector and enforce the financial 
regulations to successfully fight money laundering.

1. (C) Summary: A leading coalition of ethnic minority 
political parties, associated with Burma\'s cease-fire groups, 
insists that the SPDC must engage with ASSK and other 
political leaders before reconvening a National Convention. 
The coalition also demands that the country\'s ethnic groups 
must be able to select their own delegates to the Convention 
and that subsequent steps in the regime\'s \"road map\" must be 
the product of a tripartite dialogue.  The regime is unlikely 
to take heed and will instead reserve its negotiating chits 
to deal with the country\'s active insurgent movements.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (SBU) In a letter to the U.S. Embassy dated December 10, 
the United Nationalities Alliance (UNA), a leading coalition 
of ethnic opposition parties, lambasted the SPDC\'s attempts 
to reconvene a National Convention as \"an insult to the will 
of the (Burmese) people and the civilized international 
community.\"  The UNA acknowledges that the regime\'s 
seven-point \"road map\" for a transition to democracy had some 
merit, but the alliance is highly critical of the SPDC\'s plan 
to resume the same flawed Convention process that was 
abandoned in 1996. 
 
3. (SBU) According to the UNA, the ethnic parties have a 
\"serious desire to participate in the political process of 
national building\" and view the National Convention, if 
genuine and democratic, as an essential step to achieve a new 
constitution, political stability, and economic development. 
However, according to the UNA, the SPDC is manipulating the 
process by hand-picking pro-regime Convention delegates, 
neglecting democratic principles, and ignoring the UNGA Burma 
resolution. 
 
4. (SBU) In its December 10 letter, the UNA stated its view 
that the regime must take three key steps prior to 
reconvening the National Convention: 
 
--engage in a substantive political dialogue with ASSK and 
other political leaders, including representatives from the 
ethnic groups; 
 
--accord each group participating in the Convention the right 
to select its own delegates; 
 
--implement subsequent steps in the \"road map\" on the basis 
of a tripartite dialogue among the SPDC, the NLD, and the 
ethnic nationalities. 
 
5. (C) Background note:  The UNA was formed in 2002 by 
Burma\'s second largest democratic opposition party, the Shan 
Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD), and nine other 
political parties representing the country\'s seven major 
ethnic minority groups as a means to achieve common 
objectives and support a tripartite dialogue.  In 1992 the 
SPDC banned a predecessor coalition, the United Nationalities 
League for Democracy (UNLD) and in subsequent years 
\"de-registered\" most of the political parties that currently 
belong to the UNA. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  Hkun Htun Oo, Chairman of the SNLD and a 
Member-elect of Parliament, is the leading force behind the 
UNA and its December 10 letter.  The Shan politician is 
closely aligned with the NLD and has been a leading advocate 
among the ethnic groups on behalf of ASSK, insisting that the 
regime engage her before reconvening the National Convention. 
 However, the rest of the UNA is comprised of small parties 
who have little to lose by holding out for inclusion of the 
NLD.  The SPDC is unlikely to bend to the demands of the UNA 
and will instead reserve its negotiating chits to deal with 
the country\'s active insurgent movements.  Nonetheless, the 
UNA\'s letter stands in contrast to recent press reports that 
indicate many leading ethnic groups are throwing their weight 
behind the regime and its \"road map\" process.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  According to NLD sources, released CEC 
members are consulting with party lawyers on building a 
possible legal case to press for the release of ASSK and 
other NLD officials.  Using Burma\'s opaque court system is 
unlikely to get the SPDC to budge, but legal action could 
generate renewed domestic attention to the plight of the NLD 
movement, if not indirect pressure on the regime to deal with 
ASSK.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) We met briefly on December 30 with NLD senior official 
U Nyunt Wei to pass on holiday greetings and discuss recent 
developments.  The five NLD Central Executive Committee (CEC) 
members released in late November continue to meet on a daily 
basis to discuss party business and strategies.  Although 
military intelligence (MI) officers merely surveilled our 
meeting with U Nyunt Wei from a polite distance, they 
outright rebuffed our attempts on the same day to visit NLD 
Chairman U Aung Shwe and family members of NLD Vice Chairman 
U Tin Oo.  Both of the latter NLD leaders have been detained 
since the May 30 Depeyin attack (U Aung Shwe is under house 
arrest in Rangoon and U Tin Oo is in a Sagaing Division 
prison). 
 
3. (C) According to NLD sources, the released members of the 
NLD CEC are consulting with party lawyers and building a 
legal case to press the SPDC to free their colleagues.  In 
addition to U Aung Shwe and U Tin Oo, NLD General Secretary 
Aung San Suu Kyi and NLD Secretary (and spokesperson) U Lwin 
remain under house in Rangoon. 
 
4. (C) U Nyunt Wei told us that the legal tact stems in part 
from press reports that the SPDC claims to have extended an 
invitation to the NLD to attend an imminent National 
Convention.  \"There has been no such invitation,\" U Nyunt Wei 
said, \"but should there be one, we will insist that we must 
be able to consult with our leadership in order to form an 
official reply.\"  U Nyunt Wei added that while the released 
NLD CEC members are able to meet together and move about 
Rangoon, they are still precluded from meeting or 
communicating with ASSK. 
 
5. (C) U Nyunt Wei also said that the \"CEC Five\" had recently 
sent letters to participants in the December 15 
Thai-sponsored Burma meeting.  The released leaders have 
requested debriefings on the Bangkok discussions and they 
have to date received affirmative replies from the French and 
the Italians.  U Nyunt Wei noted that the CEC request to the 
Chinese Embassy was their second such correspondence, the 
first was sent in early December at our suggestion as a means 
to engage the Chinese, but the NLD had to date received no 
official reply to either letter. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  Despite the legal merits of addressing the 
prolonged detention and house arrest of NLD leaders, using 
Burma\'s opaque, Dickensian court system to seek the release 
of ASSK and her colleagues is unlikely to get the SPDC to 
budge.  However, ASSK has employed this tactic before and 
successfully put the regime on the defensive.  It is probable 
she has personally directed the released CEC members to 
consult with the lawyers on making a possible legal case.  In 
the absence of any visible progress in the rumored, but 
unconfirmed, \"secret\" dialogue between ASSK and the SPDC 
generals, a court case would generate renewed domestic 
attention to the plight of the NLD movement, if not indirect 
pressure on the regime to deal with ASSK.  End comment.

SUBJECT: DON\'T BLAME US FOR BURMA\'S WIMPY MANUFACTURING 
SECTOR 
 
REF: RANGOON 1425 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Though U.S. sanctions have hurt some 
Burmese manufacturers, these punitive measures are not 
primarily to blame for the sector\'s perilous situation.  An 
array of systemic problems, chronic mismanagement by the 
government, and periodic external shocks, have made Burma a 
wasteland for efficient and productive industry.  Even if 
sanctions were lifted tomorrow, we think the manufacturing 
base here, including the garment sector, would still face a 
very long and difficult road to competitiveness.  End summary. 
 
Sanctions: Piling On 
 
2. (SBU) Those who would blame new U.S. economic sanctions 
entirely for the demise of the country\'s manufacturing, and 
particularly garment, sector don\'t have the whole story. 
Though the U.S.\'s ban on Burmese imports removed the garment 
industry\'s most important market and clipped the wings of 
some other manufacturers providing components for products 
ultimately destined for the U.S. market, this ban was really 
just an extra layer of punishment on a manufacturing sector 
that\'s been sanctioned by its own government for years. 
 
3. (U) Even before the latest U.S. sanctions, the garment 
industry and most other manufacturers were in pretty poor 
shape.  According to the GOB\'s own statistics, manufacturing 
made up only 9 percent of the economy in FY 2002-03.  This 9 
percent is dominated by bloated state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs) producing sub-par goods for the domestic market in 
factories with Soviet-sounding names like the \"No. 1 Jute 
Processing Factory.\"  Manufacturing is centered in several 
large blocks of farm land rezoned for industry, established 
around Rangoon and Mandalay to take advantage of large pools 
of cheap labor.  Other factories, especially of the 
state-owned variety, have been built in various spots in the 
Burmese countryside for more political than economic reasons. 
 The ruling SPDC junta\'s Senior General Than Shwe\'s small 
hometown of Kyaukse is packed to the rafters with 
government-constructed cement, brick, and tractor factories. 
 
Foreign Investment: The Siren\'s Song 
 
4. (U) Despite the government\'s lofty rhetoric about 
welcoming foreign investment to help reform these SOEs, 
little investment has come into these factories, and only a 
few joint ventures (usually with the military\'s Myanmar 
Economic Holdings, Ltd.) remain to manufacture clothing, 
automobile engines, motorbikes, etc.  The government claims 
US$1.6 billion in \"approved\" FDI in the manufacturing sector 
since 1988.  However we suspect far less actually came into 
the country.  The vast majority of foreign investment, both 
independent and JV, in the manufacturing sector is in the 
export-oriented portion of the garment industry, a portion 
basically abandoned by the government, to take advantage of 
Burma\'s extraordinarily low wages -- even by regional 
standards.  Another source of investment for Burma\'s 
manufacturing sector has been coming via concessional loans 
and tied aid, mostly from China and India.  These millions of 
dollars have flowed in to establish factories producing items 
such as sewing machines, agricultural machines, wire, and 
bicycles. 
 
5. (SBU) Those foolish enough to be enticed into the country 
by cheap wages, or those few domestic entrepreneurs that 
attempt to run factories at an international standard, have 
been buffeted by a multitude of pre-existing and systemic 
problems that add so much to the bottom line, that initial 
wage advantages are eroded. 
 
-- First is a chronically unreliable power supply and the 
high cost of imported diesel fuel.  One electronics component 
factory we visited pours 45 percent of operating expenses 
into fuel and power generation. 
 
-- Second, no access to new capital and poor financial 
services.  Foreign investment is almost nil.  Burma has no 
functioning capital markets and private banks, the major 
source for manufacturers\' borrowing, have been unable to lend 
or do inter-bank transfers since the start of a banking 
crisis in February 2003.  Insurance is also insufficient, 
with manufacturers complaining there is none available for 
products or inputs being delivered to/from the port. 
 
-- Third, poor infrastructure.  Dismal roads and disorganized 
trucking make transportation difficult and expensive. 
Telecommunications infrastructure is in terrible condition, 
and the Internet is expensive and censored. 
-- Fourth, the double whammy of virtually no domestically 
produced inputs and very tight import restrictions.  This 
makes \"just-in-time\" delivery impossible as it requires most 
factories to warehouse spare parts and several months of 
imported inputs. 
 
-- Fifth, a poorly educated workforce that requires extensive 
training and constant oversight.  This extends to domestic 
entrepreneurs, who are seldom knowledgeable about 
international business practices and often lack vision that 
extends beyond turning a quick buck. 
 
-- Finally, because the domestic Burmese market is so 
sluggish, and kyat revenues essentially worthless except to 
pay local wages, manufacturers must focus on the export 
market.  Unfortunately, the government imposes a 10 percent 
export tax and requires a license for all exports. 
 
Government Folly 
 
6. (SBU) Most sad economic stories here can be traced to the 
government\'s incompetence and/or negligence.  The 
manufacturing sector is no exception.  Export taxes, import 
restrictions, a dysfunctional energy policy, and difficulties 
repatriating foreign currency profits, are just a few 
government-erected barriers to manufacturing.  Such behavior 
extends to the \"vision thing\" as well.  Though the government 
wisely extends some benefits to export-oriented manufacturers 
working on consignment, such as garment makers, it has 
refused to seek out and establish an appropriate niche for 
Burma\'s industrial products.  Thoughtful Burmese economists 
and entrepreneurs argue that Burma\'s industrial policy should 
focus on developing the \"supporting industries\" that Thailand 
is outgrowing.  However, the government, insistent that Burma 
is already a developed, modern nation, pours time and 
treasure into developing an IT sector and an automobile 
industry. 
 
Comment: Look Beyond Sanctions 
 
7. (SBU) A quick review of the country\'s manufacturing 
sector, the alleged epicenter of the new economic sanctions, 
shows that there is more to the country\'s suffering 
manufacturing base and high unemployment than meets a glib 
eye.  In picking through the carnage of Burma\'s economy the 
challenge will be to assess how much of the damage was caused 
by the U.S. sanctions, and how much by long-standing economic 
mismanagement or some exogenous factor.  Our initial review 
indicates the blame lies far more with the latter two reasons 
than with the first.  Two comments by businesspeople impacted 
by sanctions sum up this preliminary conclusion: \"these 
sanctions are like leprosy on a cancer patient,\" and \"how can 
your sanctions hurt us?  We\'ve been sanctioning ourselves for 
40 years.\"

1.  (C) Summary:  Prime Minister Khin Nyunt and Senior 
General Than Shwe hosted weekend functions involving 
Rangoon\'s diplomatic corps that illustrated the marked 
contrast in their styles.  Khin Nyunt is engaging and 
polished, while Than Shwe is distant, grandiose, and strikes 
some observers as somewhat dazed.  Despite these differences 
in style, both seem committed to the generals\' continued 
control of Burma, either in uniform or in mufti.  End Summary. 
 
Khin Nyunt Woos Dip Corps... 
 
2.  (SBU) Apologizing to the heads of embassies and UN 
organizations for being largely inaccessible to them since 
becoming Prime Minister on August 25, General Khin Nyunt 
hosted a \"Social Dinner\" at a large GOB guesthouse January 
2nd.  On arrival he slowly made his way down the receiving 
line, smiling and chatting amicably with many along the way. 
He gave a speech in excellent English, reviewing the 
highlights of 2003 and pledging amity and prosperity for 
2004.  During dinner a band performed mostly western music 
while an army of waiters served the nine-course meal.  At the 
evening\'s conclusion the Prime Minister (dressed in 
traditional Burmese garb) and Mrs. Khin Nyunt shook the hands 
of all departing guests and wished them a happy new year. 
Clearly General Khin Nyunt attempted to play the role of the 
charming host and gracious Prime Minister. 
 
Than Shwe\'s Independence Day Celebration 
 
3.  (C) Senior General Than Shwe, in contrast, hosted a black 
tie affair January 4 to mark the 56th anniversary of Burma\'s 
independence from Britain.  He arrived at the venue -- 
ironically, Burma\'s largely unused parliament building -- in 
a dress uniform featuring an assemblage of medals and 
decorations.  Than Shwe was preceded down the receiving line 
by a tight phalanx of twenty one photographers who shot rolls 
of film during the four minute exercise.  (Comment: why 
twenty one photographers in a country with a 
government-controlled press?  Certainly one or two official 
photographers would have sufficed, unless the press gaggle 
was to glorify the spectacle of Than Shwe\'s entry.)  Trailed 
by Prime Minister Khin Nyunt and Vice Senior General Maung 
Aye, the Senior General worked his way down the diplomatic 
receiving line, robotically shaking the hands of the 
assembled, often not even looking at them, let alone saying 
anything. 
 
Is That Senior General Anawrahta or King Than Shwe? 
 
4.  (C) After the 400 guests had quickly wolfed down dinner, 
all moved into a large hall and were treated to a Myanmar 
Cultural Night.  The evening\'s climax was a musical and dance 
tribute to King Anawrahta, the first unifier of the country. 
The Founder King was seen inspecting public works projects, 
paying homage to venerable monks, rallying the troops and 
citizenry, and building a stable and prosperous kingdom.  At 
that point the dancers froze and a cinema-sized screen began 
showing heroic clips of General Than Shwe inspecting public 
works projects, making donations to monks, addressing huge 
outdoor USDA rallies, and winning the adulation of all.  The 
blatant political crudeness of the \"cultural show\" caused 
some diplomats and UN officials new to Rangoon to gasp, then 
choke back snickers, although the more experienced knew this 
to be Than Shwe\'s standard fare. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  Khin Nyunt as polished politician versus 
Than Shwe as a Brezhnev-like dotard and buffoon are two 
superficial images probably reinforced among some who 
attended these two events.  It does not automatically follow, 
however, that there is any real policy difference between 
them despite the vast difference in style and demeanor.  Many 
diplomats charmed by Khin Nyunt\'s hospitality may be tempted 
to view him as a political \"moderate,\" when the evidence 
seems to indicate he remains steadfastly committed to the 
generals\' control of Burma.  He may be keener than some, 
however, to have the generals\' control continue in civilian 
attire, as opposed to Than Shwe\'s penchant for heavily 
bemedaled uniforms.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: On January 4, the 56th anniversary of Burma\'s 
independence, pro-democracy political parties and supporters 
held quiet, but well-attended, commemorative events in 
Rangoon.  In contrast to the regime\'s official ceremonies, 
heavily militarized functions that trumpeted the SPDC\'s 
self-proclaimed accomplishments (reftel), the pro-democracy 
events emphasized Burma\'s early struggle for independence and 
democracy and the unfinished business of achieving a 
government \"for the people and by the people.\"  Hundreds of 
party members and supporters braved the intimidating presence 
of military intelligence agents to be seen and counted at 
events sponsored by the Veteran Politicians and the NLD.  End 
Summary. 
 
The Veterans: Return Power to the People 
 
2. (U) Early on independence day, the Veteran Politicians, a 
pro-democracy association of former government and military 
officials, hosted a ceremony attended by over 400 guests and 
representatives of political parties and organizations. 
Among the attendees were several elderly survivors of the 
\"We-Burma Association\" (a nationalist movement founded in the 
1930s), members of the NLD Central Executive Committee, 
representatives of the UNLD and UNA (ethnic democracy 
coalitions), Members-Elect of Parliament, and members of the 
Committee to Represent the People\'s Parliament (CRPP).  The 
U.S. Embassy was the only diplomatic mission in attendance at 
the Veterans\' ceremony, which was held in the warehouse of 
privately owned Rangoon factory. 
 
3. (U) Thakin Thein Pe, Chairman of the Veteran Politicians, 
criticized the regime for repression and harassment and 
called for an investigation into the May 30 Depeyin attack on 
NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi.  He expressed hope that in the 
new year the \"people\'s power\" would be returned to the people 
of Burma, but questioned whether the regime\'s \"road map\" 
would achieve reconciliation given unresolved issues 
associated with the National Convention abandoned in 1996. 
 
4. (U) In a \"Commemorative Appeal,\" the Veterans reissued 
their 1999 call for tripartite talks among the SPDC, the NLD, 
and the ethnic nationalities; criticized the regime for 
ignoring the results of the 1990 elections; and called for 
the unconditional release of all political prisoners. 
 
The NLD: Regaining Independence 
 
5. (U) Following the Veterans\' ceremony, the NLD held a 
religious ceremony at a monastery in central Rangoon.  Over 
700 party members and supporters attended the event (we were 
again the only diplomatic mission in attendance).  The 
monastery\'s abbot delivered a passionate sermon in which he 
muted direct criticism of the SPDC, but cited the Buddha\'s 
pursuit of spiritual independence as a model for the current 
struggle to achieve basic freedoms. 
 
6. (U) NLD CEC member U Than Tun responded to the sermon with 
a brief speech in which he criticized the regime\'s closing of 
party offices.  He described Buddhism as the country\'s only 
reliable institution, having survived both the British and 
the Japanese, and noted that religion (as opposed to the 
military regime) is capable of helping the Burmese \"regain\" 
their independence. 
 
7. (U) In an independence day declaration, the NLD called for 
national reconciliation and dialogue, recalling that the 
Burmese people had voted for the NLD 1990 with an 
\"overwhelming\" desire to restore democratic rights lost when 
the military seized power in 1962. 
 
Comment: Question Authority - One Day at a Time 
 
8. (C) These quiet pro-democracy events paled in comparison 
to the radical demonstrations of the late 1980s and pro-NLD 
independence day rallies in previous years.  However, it is 
remarkable that hundreds of political party members and 
supporters turned out this year given the regime\'s heightened 
repression of political dissent.  Indeed, military 
intelligence agents were active at both functions, filming 
all speeches and participants, including several NLD members 
recently released from prison.  Pro-democracy activists, 
unable to meet at shuttered NLD headquarters and subject to 
arbitrary arrest, found welcome refuge with the Veteran 
politicians and at the monastery.  This was a rare 
opportunity to defy the authorities - if just for a day. End 
comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA: LIBERALIZED RICE EXPORTS AREN\'T SO LIBERAL 
 
REF: 03 RANGOON 563 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The GOB\'s sudden decision to \"suspend\" 
exports of rice was the latest foible in the move toward 
allowing the private sector to export rice for the first time 
in 40 years.  Aside from further underlining the regime\'s 
ambivalence about giving up control of Burma\'s most important 
political-economic commodity, the move also emphasizes its 
priorities for appeasement: the urban masses first, then 
everyone else.  End summary. 
 
Stop the Exporting! 
 
2. (SBU) Much to everyone\'s surprise, on January 2nd the 
government announced an abrupt \"suspension\" of all exports of 
rice, sesame, garlic, onion, chili, and corn.  This 
suspension applies to everyone, even if an export license or 
signed contract is in hand, the only exception being a single 
ship that was being loaded in the Port of Rangoon.  The 
announcement was disappointing considering the private sector 
was only beginning to take greater advantage of the rice 
market liberalizations offered by the GOB in April 2003. 
 
3. (SBU) The April policy change removes the government from 
all stages of the rice pipeline and allows all private sector 
comers to buy directly from farmers and export freely.  Of 
course \"freely\" is a relative term in Burma, but by all 
accounts in recent months some private entrepreneurs -- 
mostly those affiliated with the quasi-governmental Union of 
Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(UMFCCI) -- were buying rice, having it milled, and selling 
it to foreign buyers independently of government 
interference.  One source told us that after a very slow 
start (only about 10,000 tons actually shipped by the private 
sector since April), export contracts of 16,000 tons and 
18,000 tons had been inked for shipment in January.  By 
contrast, in 2002 -- when the agricultural trading parastatal 
exported about 900,000 tons -- Burma shipped out a minimum of 
40,000 tons per month. 
 
4. (SBU) Though the government did not publicly announce the 
suspension, a business journal affiliated with Military 
Intelligence ran a short article saying there would be a 
temporary freeze on exports to ensure the retail price of 
domestic rice did not rise.  The fear is that hundreds of 
thousands of government workers, who on January 4th lost 
their monthly rice ration in exchange for a 5,000 kyat (about 
US$5.50) monthly stipend, would rush out into the Rangoon 
market, buying up rice and pushing up prices -- potentially 
sparking instability.  The article stated that this 
suspension would last only a \"short time,\" though the meaning 
of this is not clear. 
 
Stumbling Toward Controlled Liberalization 
 
5. (SBU) The government\'s justification is not logical -- 
though not necessarily false.  With exports way down from 
2002, this season\'s harvest (November-December) quite good, 
domestic paddy and retail rice prices falling steadily over 
the last few months, and the government no longer purchasing 
rice in the marketplace, there seems little reason to fear a 
price spike.  It\'s possible, therefore, that the suspension 
has a more sinister motive.  Perhaps the government, always 
starved for foreign exchange, wants to get back into the rice 
exporting game while the gap between domestic retail prices 
(now about US$90 per ton) and higher world prices is quite 
wide. 
 
6. (SBU) In either case, the move is indicative of the 
regime\'s half-hearted support of liberalization.  Following 
its April 2003 announcement, the government was silent for 
five months before finally issuing lengthy and convoluted 
guidelines that set unreasonably high price floors for the 
exported rice and required prospective exporters to seek 
approvals and clearances by several government agencies 
before shipping.  The guidelines also outlined how exporters 
would only be able to keep 50 percent of net foreign exchange 
earnings, the balance to be kept by the GOB in exchange for 
the equivalent in kyat -- converted at a rate favorable to 
the GOB of course. 
 
7. (SBU) In addition to issuing overly bureaucratic rules, 
the government has not approached the rice reforms 
holistically, instead just waving a wand and making the rice 
markets \"free.\"  Systemic problems remain, and there has been 
no effort since April to fix any of them.  For instance, the 
government\'s skittishness on supply and prices is worsened by 
a complete lack of reliable statistics on rice production and 
consumption.  The Burmese regime remains unwilling to reach 
out for advice on rice market liberalization despite lessons 
available locally in India, Thailand, and Vietnam. 
 
Comment: Stability is Paramount 
 
8. (SBU) Even if the export restrictions on rice are lifted 
soon, we wonder if the already cautious private exporters 
will risk being burned twice.  This episode also illustrates 
two important points about the GOB\'s philosophy of control. 
First, it\'s clear that the sanctity of contracts and the 
rights of the private sector, even if it is operating at the 
request of the government, come second to political 
considerations.  Second, if we are to believe the 
government\'s explanation for the moratorium then the regime 
clearly fears pushing the urban masses too far -- even if the 
resulting policies damage the regime\'s credibility, and the 
bottom lines of traders, farmers, millers, and potentially 
the economy as a whole.  End comment.

SUBJECT: CULTIVATING THE FOURTH ESTATE 
 
1.  The Rangoon American Center hosted Burma\'s first 
journalism training course, conducted by the Indochina Media 
Memorial Foundation (IMMF), an independent media support 
foundation based in Thailand, November 10 to 23, 2003.  The 
two-week course was designed to introduce young journalists 
to the highest standards of international journalism, to 
sharpen their writing and reporting skills, while raising 
their awareness of ethical issues and the journalist\'s role 
in society.  PAS Rangoon selected 12 participants from four 
of the leading quasi-independent publications in the 
country, those who struggle to print real news while 
contending with the regime\'s censor board.  The program 
supported two MPP goals: Gaining Acceptance for U.S. 
Institutions and Values, and Supporting Democracy and Human 
Rights. 
 
2.  The participants, ranging in age from 20 to 35, included 
seven women and five men.  (Because of Burmese government 
policy making it difficult for women to get passports, only 
Burmese men have been able to participate in IMMF\'s past 
training sessions in Cambodia and Thailand, thus our 
emphasis on including women.)  They are working journalists 
at four of Rangoon\'s leading privately owned newspapers: 7 
Day News Journal, Kumudra News Journal, Living Color 
Business Magazine, and Today Media Group.  We call these 
publications \"quasi-independent\" because all content here, 
even that of privately owned media (including publications 
of the American Center), must be passed by the Ministry of 
the Interior\'s Press Scrutiny Board. 
 
3.  Trainer Jeff Hodson led two weeks of intensive hands-on 
training in journalistic skills.  Using discussion, 
lectures, videos, case studies, individual feedback from the 
instructor, group critiques, and a variety of 
reporting/writing assignments, the participants practiced 
bread-and-butter skills such as interview techniques, how to 
write a strong lead, how to recognize good quotes from bad 
quotes, and how to write a good profile.  And they debated 
journalism ethics, international journalism standards, and 
the role of the journalist in their society.  They discussed 
Burma\'s unique press environment and their particular 
difficulty of how to predict what the Press Scrutiny Board 
will allow to be published. 
 
4.  The training course was held in a classroom of the 
American Center\'s English Teaching Program designed and 
wired for such training sessions.  Because they easily fit 
in with our usual English Class crowd, the journalists 
aroused no suspicion with the Military Intelligence who sit 
outside the American Center gate.  An added benefit of 
post\'s robust English Teaching Program is the ability to 
hold this and other types of training sessions without 
rousing the regime\'s attention.   This type of training 
could be replicated in Mandalay, as well, if a branch 
American Center is opened there. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  In a country that has no press freedom, there 
has been no institution to provide training to the people 
working for the quasi-independent media in Burma.  Thus, the 
younger generation of journalists has to rely on on-the-job 
training by their chief editors, the majority of whom have 
not received any systematic journalism training themselves. 
The training offered a rare opportunity for young 
journalists to get real training and gave them exposure for 
the very first time to international standards of 
journalism.  The journalists, their editors, and the 
American Center are all eager to repeat this type of 
training and to take it further.  We will be working with 
the IMMF as well as Internews, both of whom receive Economic 
Support Funds (ESF), to increase opportunities for this type 
of training inside Burma.

Classified By: CDA, a.i. Ronald K. McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  After several days of confusion about who is 
coming and when, local contacts reported today, Thursday Jan 
15, that a 21-strong KNU delegation led by Gen. Bo Mya has 
arrived from Bangkok.  While here, the KNU will reportedly 
only discuss a cease-fire and Karen autonomy, not the 
national convention.  Some observers think a cease-fire 
agreement is possible.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  According to Prof. Saw Simon Tha, a leader of the 
Karen community in Rangoon, Karen National Union (KNU) leader 
General Bo Mya arrived in Rangoon today at the head of a 
21-person delegation to discuss terms with Prime Minister 
General Khin Nyunt for a KNU-SPDC cease-fire.  The KNU 
delegation is here because of Thai PM Thaksin\'s initiative to 
resolve regional conflicts and push forward with regional 
economic development, according to Professor Tha.  Gen Bo Mya 
is reportedly accompanied by six KNU Central Executive 
Committee members. 
 
3.  (C) According to Professor Simon Tha, who led two 
delegations of Karen to Mae Sot in late November and again in 
late December to speak to the KNU leadership on behalf of the 
Karens in Rangoon, Bo Mya may have the authority to sign a 
cease fire with the SPDC while on this trip.  Prof. Tha said 
he was optimistic, and feels it likely a cease-fire will be 
signed.  However, Bo Mya will only discuss a cease-fire and 
steps required for Karen autonomy within a federal union. 
The KNU is seeking a deal from the SPDC similar to what the 
Wa have where they keep their own arms, run their own police 
and jails, and manage their own regional economic and 
cultural development programs with Rangoon handling national 
defense and foreign policy.  Though PM Khin Nyunt has told 
Prof. Tha that all ethnic groups, cease-fire or not, will be 
able to come to the National Convention, the KNU will 
reportedly not discuss joining the national convention on 
this visit. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT: According to other sources, the SPDC is now 
planning January 16-18 for its three-day quarterly general 
meeting with SPDC members, regional commanders, the cabinet, 
and light infantry division commanders.  This may indicate 
the SPDC didn\'t hold the meeting in Dec 03 due to 
expectations of KNU to reach a cease-fire agreement with the 
KNU shortly before the New Year.

1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The five NLD CEC members not under house 
arrest continue to meet daily and are pushing the security 
envelope further.  The CEC is \"putting the house back in 
order\" and has held meetings with NLD Chairs from all of 
Burma\'s States and Divisions.  Township-level meetings have 
begun as well.  The CEC received briefings from most of the 
participants in the Dec 15 Thai-sponsored Burma meeting in 
Bangkok.  The CEC says a KNU cease-fire is a good thing and 
won\'t hurt them in a National Convention.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) Four of the five free NLD Central Executive Committee 
members met with PolOff January 14 to discuss recent 
developments.  U Nyunt Wei, the NLD\'s economic advisor, 
provided the following points: 
 
- NLD is busy putting its house back in order.  Though still 
not in communication with ASSK, the rump CEC has held 
meetings with NLD Division and State Chairs, and are now 
beginning meetings with township-level Chairs.  So far the 
security forces have not interfered.  The message the CEC 
most frequently hears from the rank and file party membership 
is \"when will the revolution start?\" 
 
- At the request of the CEC (ref B), the French, Italian, 
German, Japanese, UNDP, and Razali\'s representative Leon de 
Reidmatten have all stopped in to brief the CEC on the 
December Thai-sponsored meeting on Burma (ref C).  The 
Chinese and Indians have declined to accept the invitation. 
 
- The CEC mailed a confidential letter to Sr Gen Than Shwe 
first week of January \"respectfully requesting\" the SPDC 
explain what the 7-point road map is all about.  U Nyunt Wei 
offered that it is difficult to plan if NLD doesn\'t know what 
the details are.  No response to date. 
 
- The CEC disagrees with UNSYG Annan\'s categorization of the 
SPDC road map as a democratic transition, and views it 
instead as the legitimization of a military dictatorship. 
 
- The road map is nothing new, it merely states the steps 
that have always been needed to form a new government.  The 
timing of the announcement of the road map was designed to 
take attention away from the Depeyin attack, and to respond 
to U.S. sanctions. 
 
- The visit of KNU leader Gen Bo Mya is a good thing -- 
\"everyone should be talking and not shooting\"\" each other. 
Nyunt Wei feels \"Bo Mya won\'t throw 50 years of work down the 
drain to promote a dictatorship.\"  And a KNU cease-fire would 
not weaken the NLD\'s position on the National Convention 
(NC).  \"They can hold it without us anyway.\" 
 
- The CEC is aware of the Shan Nationalities League for 
Democracy (SNLD) decision to send delegates\' names to the 
SPDC for the NC.  (Comment: But the SNLD has not committed to 
participate unless its stringent conditions are met.)  U 
Nyunt Wei opined it is possible the SPDC is going to pull 
many of the ethnic groups into the NC. 
 
- Regarding political tactics used for the road map, the SPDC 
will press for what is wants, then the NLD will do the same 
-- and then compromise will follow.  Nyunt Wei again said 
that the entire road map process is merely designed to 
legitimize a military dictatorship. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT:  The continued detention of ASSK and other 
NLD leaders has heretofore paralyzed the democracy movement. 
However, the rump CEC\'s dogged determination to press on is a 
clear reminder that the SPDC can tighten the noose but not 
extinguish the flame of dissent.  The CEC\'s letter to Sr Gen 
Than Shwe is indication that the NLD has not ruled out 
participation in the National Convention.  END SUMMARY.

SUBJECT: BURMA: RUMORS OF CONSTRUCTION OF A NUCLEAR REACTOR 
NEAR MINBU 
 
REF: STATE 297614 AND PREVIOUS 03 RANGOON 1427 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (S/NF) An expatriate businessman who travels regularly to 
Magway Division recently volunteered to an Embassy Officer 
that he had heard rumors that a nuclear reactor was being 
built near Minbu, in central Magway Division on the Irawaddy 
River.  The businessman added that he personally had seen a 
\"massive\" barge containing large-sized rebar being unloaded 
on a trip to the area.  After asking local residents about 
the rebar\'s purpose, he was told that similar size barge 
shipments were arriving almost weekly and that the rebar was 
to be used in the construction of unnamed/unidentified 
factories.  In the opinion of the businessman, the quantities 
involved as well as the diameter of the rebar suggested a 
project larger than \"factories.\"  Along these lines, the 
businessman noted that there was a new airport near Minbu 
with a landing strip that, based on its length and thickness, 
seemed excessive, adding that \"you could land the space 
shuttle on it.\" 
 
2.  (S/NF) Comment:  Rumors of construction of a nuclear 
facility in/near Magway Division date back to 2002 and 
generally refer to alleged Goverment of Burma (GOB) and 
Russian cooperation on a nuclear research reactor project. 
Similar rumors, sans the \"Russia\" angle, have been 
circulating with greater frequency within diplomatic and 
expatriate circles since a November 2003 Far Eastern Economic 
Review (FEER) article which described signs of growing 
military ties between North Korea and Burma.  While we have 
no direct evidence of this alleged cooperation, rumors of 
ongoing construction of a nuclear reactor are surprisingly 
consistent and observations of activity such as that 
described above appear to be increasing, as are alleged 
sightings of North Korean \"technicians\" inside Burma.

SUBJECT: BURMA CAN\'T FIGHT PHONY PHARMAS FROM INDIA AND 
CHINA 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Sick Burmese are suffering under a flood of 
fake, unregistered, or sub-standard pharmaceuticals primarily 
imported from India and China.  Though honest importers and 
the government are making some efforts to deal with the 
situation, little can be done without a better regulatory 
framework, more government enforcement resources, and an 
improvement of the economy.  End summary. 
 
A Flood of Knock-Offs 
 
2. (SBU) A prominent physician, drug importer, and head of 
the Myanmar Pharmaceutical Suppliers Entrepreneur Association 
(MPSEA), echoed recent statements by WHO that ersatz, 
unregistered, and sub-standard medicines were growing 
problems for Burma.  Though domestically produced Burmese 
fakes are limited mostly to local-label vitamins and mild 
pain relievers, the majority of imported counterfeits are 
powerful brand-name antibiotics and other drugs used to fight 
serious infectious diseases like TB.  He asserted that 
increasing poverty in Burma was driving demand for cheaper 
drugs and that supply was abundant due to booming counterfeit 
drug industries in neighboring India and China.  Poor legal 
controls on the distribution of pharmaceuticals in Burma, 
wide-open borders, and inadequate government resources to 
enforce existing regulations exacerbate the problem. 
 
3. (SBU) Currently the law requires all drugs for sale in 
Burma be tested by and registered with the GOB\'s Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).  In reality, though, the FDA has 
few resources to spot check pharmacies -- usually quite 
informal -- and drugs for sale to ensure they are genuine and 
registered.  Instead, the government is dealing with the 
growing problem by trying to arrest distributors and 
importers suspected of dealing in fake pharmaceuticals.  On 
December 13 of last year, authorities arrested several people 
and seized more than five million phony imported antibiotic 
capsules. 
 
Don\'t Do (Fake) Drugs! 
 
4. (SBU) In the current environment, it is a losing battle 
against these dangerous medicines.  The doctor said that 
counterfeiters are so good now it is impossible to tell a 
drug is fake from its appearance or packaging.  Only lab 
tests can tell the difference between real pharmaceuticals 
and the chalk or flour fillers favored by fraudsters.  In 
Burma such testing is quite difficult due to a lack of 
knowledge, labs, and human resources.  Even prices offer no 
clue.  Though knock-offs have gained market share because 
they are cheap, there is no way for a consumer to know 
whether a certain drug is being sold \"below market\" value. 
There are no common benchmark prices for drugs amongst the 
country\'s distributors -- only a tiny number of which are run 
by someone with any pharmacological training.  Also, clever 
counterfeit dealers often discount their wares only a small 
amount (perhaps 5 kyat (0.5 cent) per tablet) to avoid 
arousing suspicion. 
 
5. (SBU) For now, the doctor said, his association is 
striving to educate the government and consumers via the 
media regarding the dangers of counterfeit or sub-standard 
pharmaceuticals.  Association members have also agreed to 
police themselves, trying to avoid buying and distributing 
bad medicine and encouraging other sellers in their 
marketplaces to eschew the cheap but dangerous drugs. 
Finally, the MPSEA is reaching out to the best-established 
pharmacies and private clinics around Rangoon, urging them to 
pay a little more to buy from well-known multinational 
companies via reputable importers -- such as MPSEA members. 
 
Comment: Little Can Be Done 
 
6. (SBU) The Association\'s best education efforts and the 
government\'s arrests only scratch the surface.  Nothing will 
stop the inflow and consumption of bogus drugs until there is 
a better regulatory framework and more resources for 
enforcement.  Currently there is no system of prescriptions 
and no requirements for the establishment of a pharmacy or 
for selling even the most potent medication.  The situation 
may get worse, the physician opined, if India cracks down on 
its domestic sales of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and its 
producers rely even more on Burma for sales.  End comment.

SUBJECT: UWSA SEEKS TO IMPORT PRECURSOR CHEMICALS LEGALLY 
 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  The leadership of the United Wa State Army, 
while trumpeting the dramatic reduction of opium poppy 
production in Wa territories, is seeking special dispensation 
to openly import precursor chemicals, ostensibly for the 
industrial processing of natural rubber.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) POOR EX-POPPY FARMERS:  UWSA leader Pu Yu Chen (as he 
transliterates his name) told a visiting group of GOB 
officials and diplomats January 24 that the sharp drop in 
opium poppy cultivation has created severe hardships for 
former poppy farmers and their families.  Half of all people 
in UWSA territory lacked food security Pu Yu Chen claimed, 
calling on the GOB and the international community to provide 
increased assistance.  Note: The UWSA territory, known as 
Special Region #2 in Rangoon, has a population of about half 
a million, with 400,000 in the northern region bordering 
China and 100,000 recently transplanted to the southern 
region bordering Thailand.  End Note. 
 
3.  (C) PRECURSORS, PLEASE:  Pu Yu Chen received the visiting 
delegation in the UWSA capital of Pan San, a prosperous 
looking Chinese-style city of about 25,000.  Discussions and 
lunch took place in a modern multi-story  building situated 
next to a three-story massage parlor.  Chen introduced much 
of his cabinet, then detailed infrastructure, economic 
development, and crop-substitution projects undertaken by the 
UWSA.  The rubber industry featured prominently in Chen\'s 
economic plans.  Indeed, the rugged hills ringing Pan San had 
been terraced and planted with young rubber trees.  Chen then 
made a special plea.  To add value to natural resources and 
create jobs, the UWSA wanted to process the natural latex 
into finished rubber products.  To do this they needed to 
import certain chemicals, some of which, he explained, were 
unfortunately deemed precursor chemicals used in 
methamphetamine production.  Pu Yu Chen said he hoped the 
UWSA would be allowed to do this, as the Wa\'s opium-free 
economic future depended on projects such as this. 
 
4.  (C) FUNNY BUSINESS:  The delegation heard the same pitch 
by UWSA district leader Lu Shin Kya in Nam Teek, a new town 
of maybe 10,000 people located where the borders of China, Wa 
territory, and the Kokang region meet (98-50\' N, 23-27\' E). 
Lu Shin Kya said \"only 600\" families still produced opium 
poppies in his district, down from 2,800 previously.  The 
UWSA district leader asked the GOB ministers for a soft loan 
of $100,000 to build a rubber-processing factory, for which 
they would need to import some \"chemical pharmaceuticals.\" 
The Italian DCM told us he had visited Nam Teek last year and 
had seen a rubber factory housed in a new building but with 
apparently old or unused machinery inside.  \"There is some 
funny-business going on here,\" concluded the Italian. 
 
5.  (SBU) TRAVEL NOTE:  The DCM and DEA country attach 
traveled January 23 - 26 on the Ministry of Home Affair\'s 
\"Study Visit to Border Areas and Middle Part of Myanmar.\" 
The group, including five GOB cabinet ministers, eight 
ambassadors, and two dozen other diplomats and UN reps, 
undertook a tightly scripted tour that entailed eighteen 
takeoffs and landings in Russian-built and Burmese Air Force 
maintained MI-17 helicopters.  Meanwhile, P/E Chief traveled 
overland with UNODC to some of the same UWSA border areas and 
will report his very different (\"less scripted\") experiences 
and perspectives septel. 
 
6.  (C) SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE WA: 
 
-- The UWSA enjoys the highest degree of autonomy and 
self-administration of any of the 17 cease-fire groups.  It 
often seemed that the UWSA\'s Special Region #2 was not part 
of Burma.  Even car license plates were unique, beginning 
with Latin script \"SW\" in the south and \"NW\" in the northern 
zone (for Southern Wa and Northern Wa, respectively). 
 
-- While Pan San looked prosperous, many civilians in the 
southern Wa zone looked poor, bedraggled, and unhealthy. 
 
-- The UWSA troops wore green uniforms with a red patch over 
the left shirt pocket that read, in English, \"UWSA Army.\" 
Many of the AK-47 toting UWSA troops, especially in the 
southern zone, were teenagers. 
 
-- On many occasions the high-powered delegation (five senior 
GOB cabinet ministers, eight ambassadors, etc.) was entirely 
under the control of heavily armed UWSA troops.  In 
security-paranoid Burma, this demonstrates an extremely high 
level of trust and confidence between the UWSA and the SPDC. 
7.  (C) Comment:  Over lunch in Pan San some members of the 
group rather ungenerously wondered aloud if our host\'s 
blatant request to be allowed to import precursor chemicals 
legally was an indication that the Wa drug producers planned 
to stay in the same business, only change their product line.

SUBJECT: CHINESE DAMS, CHINESE INFLUENCE IN BURMA 
 
REF: RANGOON 88 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1.  (SBU) SURGING CHINESE SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFLUENCE:  Emboffs 
traveling on GOB-organized \"Study Visit\" to border regions 
and central Burma January 23 - 26 witnessed a high degree of 
Chinese socio-economic influence across a 325-mile stretch of 
Burma\'s Shan State border with China, especially in the 
self-administered autonomous regions of ethnic minority 
cease-fire groups.  Even in the interior northern towns of 
Lashio, Kengtung, and Maymyo (Pwin U Lwin) we saw and heard 
clear indications of major Chinese economic inroads.  Another 
emboff who traveled to the Chinese border regions with UNODC 
will report septel on some striking indications of Chinese 
dominance of the economy and social fabric in some parts of 
Burma\'s frontier regions. 
 
2.  (SBU) THE HIGH DAM:  Emboffs visited the Ye Ywa Dam site, 
located 39 miles SW of Mandalay.  Scheduled for completion in 
2007, the 433 foot high dam will create a reservoir filling a 
canyon some 45 miles long.  When completed the dam\'s hydro 
plant will generate 790 MW of electricity, adding 
significantly to the current countrywide total of perhaps 
1,500 MW.  A Swiss firm, Colenco Power Engineering Co., has 
provided the engineering consulting expertise, and the 
Export-Import Bank of China provided a $200 million soft loan 
to cover two-thirds of the hard-currency costs of the 
project.  This loan was agreed to during Senior General Than 
Shwe\'s January 2003 visit to the PRC, and is to be used to 
purchase Chinese equipment and material for the dam project. 
The GOB sees this project providing the energy for industrial 
expansion of a large swath of central Burma in coming years. 
 
3.  (SBU) CHINESE CONSULTANTS, TIED LOANS:  After visiting a 
major irrigation scheme near Salin on the Irrawaddy River in 
Magway Division (equipped with massive Chinese pumping 
equipment) emboffs then toured a nearly complete, 
multi-purpose dam 48 miles WNW of Minbu.  The Mone Dam is 
financed by a soft Chinese loan of $32 million from the China 
International Investment & Trust, specifically for the 
purchase of Chinese equipment and material.  In addition, the 
Mone Dam utilizes Chinese engineering consultants.  Schedule 
to be finished in March 2004, the 200 foot high dam will 
provide irrigation water and 75 MW of hydro-electricity. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT:  With no guiding political ideology, Burma\'s 
military regime seems to be pursuing the aim of \"legitimacy 
through infrastructure.\"  Chinese soft loans for Burmese 
infrastructure projects provide the capital-poor SPDC with a 
lifeline to resources badly needed to meet the regime\'s 
developmental goals. 
 
5.  (S) COMMENT CONTINUED:  Emboffs were flown on a Burmese 
Air Force MI-17 helicopter the 48 miles across the dry, flat 
plains of Magway Division from Mone Dam to Minbu on a clear 
day with good visibility.  If the GOB were attempting to hide 
a sensitive weapons or other facility NW of Minbu, it seems 
odd that they chose to fly us over that route.  At Mone we 
witnessed around-the-clock work being done to complete the 
dam within the next 60 days, including the installation of 
heavy-gauge (inch and a half) iron re-rod in the 210-foot 
deep concrete-lined surge tank.  Reports (ref) of 
suspiciously heavy rebar being off-loaded at Minbu could 
conceivably have been based on sightings of materials being 
rushed to complete the Mone Dam.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: AN ODD TRIP WITH FIVE BURMESE MINISTERS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Two Emboffs joined five senior Burmese 
cabinet ministers and others in a four-day, 1,400 mile \"Study 
Visit\" of border areas and central Burma January 23 - 26. 
Traveling at close quarters with these ministers revealed 
them to be greedy, pampered, highly organized, and 
perpetually exposed to a Potempkin village image of Burma. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) The Study Visit, and annual affair mounted by the 
Ministry of Home Affairs, included seventeen diplomats and 
six UN and NGO representatives.  A main focus of the trip was 
the need for additional assistance to impoverished rural 
border areas that formerly grew opium poppies.  (See septels 
for other aspects of this trip.)  The SPDC seemed to have 
three objectives in mounting the tour: 
 
A) to influence the travel-restricted, Rangoon-bound 
diplomatic corps by highlighting the SPDC\'s \"successes\" in 
normally inaccessible parts of the country; 
 
B) to show local potentates, both cease-fire group leaders 
and Burmese military officers, that the GOB is willing to 
help by bringing potential investors and aid donors to their 
areas; and 
 
C) to renew and reinforce the personal patron-client ties 
linking the ministers and local leaders. 
 
3.  (SBU) TIGHT SCRIPTS, BLESSEDLY RELIABLE HELICOPTERS: 
Emboffs and others went into the tour with eyes wide open, 
knowing full well that the trip would be tightly scripted and 
carefully planned with SPDC aims in mind.  The logistical 
coordination was carried off like clockwork, despite remote 
locations, rugged terrain, and the fact that much of the 
territory visited was under the control of cease-fire groups, 
not the GOB.  The group made eighteen takeoffs and landings 
in Burmese Air Force Russian-made MI-17 helicopters (the 
model involved in the 2002 crash that killed the SPDC\'s then 
Secretary 2).  The two MI-17s were configured with 24 
 
SIPDIS 
aircraft-type seats each and proved reliable, if noisy and 
cramped.  One was built in 1992, the other in 1997, according 
to the aircrews.  A Russian company had a service contract 
until 2001, but now all maintenance is reportedly done by the 
Burmese Air Force. 
 
4.  (SBU) A TYPICAL STOP:  Most of the tour was spent in 
ethnic minority areas of Shan State bordering China or 
Thailand, areas where opium poppy cultivation in recent years 
had been the main agricultural activity.  A typical stop went 
something like this: 
 
-- helicopters land at freshly prepared helipads, visitors 
disembark and are met by cease-fire group leaders, then 
parade down long lines of locals turned out to greet the 
VIPs.  Hundreds of villagers clap, listlessly wave small 
Burmese flags, or chant \"Mingalaba\" (the typical Burmese 
greeting), though few, if any, of the villagers speak 
Burmese.  The villagers are not smiling. 
 
-- Group approaches a fleet of parked Land Cruisers, followed 
by vans, and a bus or two.  Most vehicles do not have Burmese 
license plates, but sport those of the local cease-fire 
group\'s autonomous region.  Locals hold placards outside each 
vehicle with the names of the intended passengers--all in 
strict protocol order.  Ministers, ambassadors, and various 
lower life forms mount vehicles, which roar off in a cloud of 
dust to a meeting hall. 
 
-- Lectures begin, usually after a brief welcome by the local 
authority.  Each lecture includes a PowerPoint presentation, 
a statistical compilation of infrastructure built, and a plea 
for additional international assistance.  Juice or pop, 
bottled water, fruit, tea, and savory snacks are on coffee 
tables near each chair.  There are clearly marked flush 
toilets available at every stop.  The Foreign Minister 
usually gets in the last word, then the group dashes out to 
the vehicles to inspect a development project or two. 
 
-- After visiting a rice mill, Japanese-funded clinic, or 
Thai-funded agro project, the vehicles roar back to the 
helipad, where a folkloric troupe dances us farewell.  As the 
gale-force wash of the helicopter blades throws a wall of 
grit and debris over the hapless dance troupe, we lift off 
for the next event on the itinerary. 
 
5.  (C) GI\'ME THAT THING, WHATEVER IT IS:  The ministers 
expected to be comped wherever they went.  The group stayed 
in government-owned hotels, a few of which were specially 
stocked with a variety of give-away items.  In Maymyo (Pyin U 
Lwin) the ministers went out for an early golf game and 
helped themselves to new balls, socks, and hats from the pro 
shop, according to an accompanying diplomat.  They got crates 
of tangerines when the group visited a citrus farm.  One 
minister requisitioned leftover promotional satchels at a dam 
construction site and had his batman carry the lot out to the 
helicopter.  After each lunch or overnight stop, the 
ministers\' lackeys hauled out bottles of booze, wrapped 
presents, and other goodies. 
6.  (C) VICE?  WHAT VICE?:  Many of the notoriously sordid 
border cities we visited were surprisingly quiet, almost 
deserted.  Our GOB hosts attributed it to Chinese New Year 
celebrations and travels.  However, another Emboff was in the 
border-crossing town of Mongla the day after the Study Visit 
left, and found it buzzing with vice, business, and shady 
characters (septel).  In one Wa town UNODC reps said the 
casino had been closed down the night before the group 
arrived. 
 
7.  (C) NO RESPECT:  Oddly, the ministers were formal and 
very protocol conscious, but fairly discourteous to each 
other.  Often during one minister\'s lecture, another would 
stand up and begin talking to someone else.  Commerce 
Minister Pyi Sone, wearing four heavily bejeweled rings, said 
almost nothing the whole trip.  He did beam broadly when his 
colleagues announced that the next stop (Mong Ywan) was where 
he had led the successful attack on drug baron Khun Sa\'s last 
stronghold in 1996.  Foreign Minister Win Aung was a real 
\"gas bag,\" to quote one participant, who always wanted to 
have the last word on any subject.  Labor Minister Tin Win 
twice mentioned, in hurt tones, the United State\'s 1997 
sanctions, imposed when he was ambassador in Washington. 
Home Affairs Minister Tin Hlaing was the only one always in 
uniform and took a leading role when we met with the Wa and 
Kokang leadership.  Border Areas Minister Thein Nyunt was 
pleased to see billboards featuring pictures of him meeting 
Kokang leaders in the Kokang capital of Laukkai.  In short, 
the group of five always seemed to be jockeying for position, 
profile, or advantage. 
 
8.  (C) PAMPERED: During one long helicopter flight Emboff 
was startled to see a police major jump up from his seat and 
dash toward the front of the aircraft.  No emergency, just 
that Brig. General Khin Yi, Director General of the Burmese 
Police Force, was struggling to get his arm out of his jacket 
sleeve.  When the group arrived at Magway airport to fly back 
to Rangoon, we noted five police officers standing at 
attention in the terminal, all holding long black umbrellas. 
Odd, we thought, since it hadn\'t rained in Magway since 
September.  When the five ministers began the seventy-foot 
amble out to the aircraft, the Parasol Patrol leaped into 
action, unfurling the umbrellas and running to catch the 
ministers, awkwardly holding them above the ministers\' heads 
to keep any strong rays from discomforting the VIPs. 
 
9.  (C) COMMENT:  While many of the diplomatic participants 
were embarrassed or put off by the ministers\' attitudes and 
behavior, the ministers themselves seemed to quite enjoy the 
trip.  After the power, fawning, and advantages accruing to 
the ministers under the military regime, wouldn\'t it be hard 
for them to go back to the barracks and return to ordinary 
soldiering, we wondered?  Despite the nature of the Study 
Visit, Embassy Rangoon\'s participation was worthwhile for 
several reasons.  It gave us insights to the various 
ministers and their interactions with local authorities, got 
us into remote areas of interest to the USG (such as the UWSA 
capital of Pan San and some sensitive parts of Magway 
Division), allowed us to successfully twist the arms of 
ministers on outstanding bilateral issues, and enabled us to 
see UNODC and other assistance projects in action.  A weird, 
but worthwhile trip.  End Comment.

TAGS: EAGR, TBIO, SOCI, PGOV, BM, Avian Influenza 
SUBJECT: AVIAN FLU: BURMA TIGHTENS DEFENSES TO REPEL NEW 
THAI INVADER 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: There appears to be no avian influenza yet 
in Burma and the government has taken the initiative to keep 
it that way.  An interagency committee has begun a broad 
prevention program, which includes cutting off imports of 
baby chicks from Thailand.  Though we are relatively 
confident in the GOB\'s assessment thus far, it will be very 
difficult to know when and if the \"bird flu\" makes the jump 
into Burma.  End summary. 
 
Battening Down the Hatcheries 
 
2. (SBU) In response to outbreaks of \"bird flu\" elsewhere in 
Asia, the Burmese government first took steps on January 20 
to address the prospects of the disease moving into Burma\'s 
chicken population.  The joint Ministry of Health/Ministry of 
Livestock and Fisheries \"Work Committee for Prevention and 
Treatment of Avian Influenza\" determined that there was no 
flu in Burma (a notion later seconded informally to the Chief 
of Mission by the local WHO rep) but that preventive measures 
should be initiated immediately to educate the people and 
strengthen controls on imported chickens. 
 
3. (SBU) This latter measure became more urgent after January 
23, when neighboring Thailand, the source of millions of 
Burma\'s imported chicks, finally admitted its flocks were 
harboring several cases of the disease.  On January 24, the 
Committee announced a moratorium on the import of any poultry 
products without a health certificate verified by the 
Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries.  The Committee also 
announced it would order local SPDC cadres and health and 
livestock officials to increase inspections across the 
country of local poultry farms -- especially those in the 14 
townships along the Thai border.  Finally, the Committee 
launched an aggressive education campaign in local media 
aimed at both farmers and consumers.  The GOB has not yet 
ordered any culling of Burma\'s chicken flocks, though there 
are rumors that the Committee has pre-emptively ordered the 
quarantine of chicken farm workers along the Thai border. 
This has not been verified, though. 
 
Chicken Farming a Booming Business 
 
4. (SBU) The GOB\'s vigilance is wise considering the huge 
number of domestic and imported chickens raised and sold 
across the country.  According to a Ministry of Livestock and 
Fisheries official, last year there were 62 million chickens 
raised in Burma.  Burmese farmers -- including at government 
and military-owned farms -- have been raising increasing 
numbers of chickens in response to a government campaign to 
produce more \"Myanmar meat and fish\" to feed booming urban 
populations and the supposedly increasing number of foreign 
tourists.  For the latter audience local chicken farmers have 
been importing more and more Thai chicks (known as \"CP 
chickens,\" taking the name a large Thai agribusiness concern) 
in recent years -- 12 million in 2003.  Native Burmese 
chickens are what we would affectionately call \"free range;\" 
quite tough and scrawny, laying small and often fertilized 
eggs.  The CP chickens, farm-raised, tend to be larger, of 
better health, and produce more, larger, and unfertilized 
eggs. 
 
5. (SBU) A local chicken farmer with whom we spoke said that 
he knew of no outbreaks of the avian flu.  However, he said 
somewhat superstitiously that fellow Rangoon-area poultry 
farmers had been complaining about a reduction in egg 
production in the latter half of January.  He also mentioned 
the sudden deaths of 30,000 chickens along the southern 
Burma-Thai border in mid-January, but thought it was due to 
colder than normal weather in that region. 
 
Comment: Is it Really Safe? 
 
6. (SBU) As during the SARS scare of 2003, it will be 
difficult to know for sure whether Burma remains avian flu 
free.  The government has made its claims, but it is not at 
all clear that the GOB would make an announcement if it found 
evidence of the flu -- instead possibly dealing quietly with 
the suspected cases and maintaining the \"flu free\" posture. 
Even with best intentions the GOB will have little luck 
controlling the lengthy and porous Thai border if someone is 
intent on importing potentially infected Thai chickens.  The 
plummeting local price of chicken meat and eggs, though, 
makes it economically illogical for a Burmese farmer to do 
so.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA SANCTIONS: GARMENT INDUSTRY TAKES STOCK 
 
REF: 03 RANGOON 1425 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: We are getting a slightly clearer picture of 
the impact of last year\'s U.S. import ban on the Burmese 
garment industry -- the industry most directly impacted by 
the measure.  Even the most optimistic garment manufacturers 
say they will not survive 2005, when the global quota system 
will end, unless the import ban is lifted in 2004.  Employers 
lament the number of layoffs thus far, and predict more as 
the year progresses.  Finally, based on information gathered 
from our garment industry contacts, it does not appear that 
large numbers of garment workers have entered the region\'s 
flourishing illegal sex and entertainment industries.  End 
summary. 
 
The Calm Before the Storm 
 
2. (SBU) Six months after the implementation of a ban on 
Burmese imports into the United States, garment makers have 
basically written off their industry\'s future.  Burma\'s 
garment industry, operating purely on a low-profit \"cut, 
manufacture, and package\" (CMP) basis, had relied on the U.S. 
market for about 80 percent of its orders. 
 
3. (C) Industry representatives are not in accord on the 
viability of the garment sector once global quotas are 
abolished in 2005.  Some think they could take advantage of 
rising labor costs in China to squeeze out some market share 
based solely on low wages.  However, others insist that the 
high non-wage costs of production in Burma, particularly 
energy costs, and the total lack of domestically produced 
inputs, including fabric and accessories, have already doomed 
the garment sector.  All agreed, though, that if U.S. 
sanctions continue through 2004 nothing can save the 
remaining garment factories.  No matter their assessment, all 
of the garment manufacturers with whom we spoke are packing 
their parachutes, fully preparing to try and bail out over 
greener pastures by the end of this year. 
 
Critical Condition 
 
4. (C) According to estimates given us by several garment 
factory owners, since sanctions went into effect in late 
August 2003, about 120 out of roughly 300 factories have 
closed.  50,000-60,000 workers have lost their jobs both from 
shuttered plants and other factories trying to stay alive by 
sloughing off a few workers every month.   The manufacturers 
told us that most of these closures and lay-offs had occurred 
in the first few months of sanctions, and that the situation 
was in stasis at the moment.  Some unexpected, but 
short-term, orders from Europe had frozen firings and factory 
closures, though no factories have re-opened as has been 
reported in the media. 
 
5. (C) Though the fate of the newly unemployed workers, 
mostly young women, is still debatable one factory owner had 
an anecdote which provides an unscientific glimpse at one 
group of workers.  He told us that when he recently contacted 
300 ex-workers to try and rehire them to take advantage of 
some new orders, he was surprised that only 60 took him up on 
his offer.  Of the 240 that refused to come back, he said 
about 180 had gone back to their rural hometowns and were, he 
opined, forbidden by protective families to return to the 
city.  Another 50 had stayed in Rangoon and taken lower 
paying, but far easier, service jobs.  The remaining ten had 
entered the entertainment industry, though he thought most 
had become waitresses or karaoke hostesses rather than 
prostitutes. 
 
Government Help is Too Little Too Late 
 
6. (C) As mentioned in reftel, the government has made a 
half-hearted effort to hire some laid-off workers to take up 
similar positions (at less than half the pay) in new 
state-owned textile plants.  Our private sector contacts said 
they knew of no former employees that had grabbed this 
opportunity.  The government has also loosened a few 
regulations for garment makers, including the one which 
previously banned them from using their export income to 
finance imports, which is helping moribund garment makers to 
keep their heads above water. 
 
Comment: The Picture Sharpens 
 
7. (C) As always, predicting the fate of laid off workers, 
and the industry itself, is difficult.  However, we are 
getting a slightly clearer image of the post-sanctions shake 
out of the garment sector.  The regime has no intention of 
helping make the industry more competitive with neighboring 
countries for non-U.S. orders.  It\'s also clear that garment 
manufacturers are pragmatically preparing for the worst, 
though still hoping that the plight of their factories and 
workers will move Congress to lift the import ban this year. 
Finally, information gathered from our garment industry 
contacts does not indicate that large numbers of garment 
workers have entered the region\'s flourishing entertainment 
or illegal sex industries.  Though inevitably some ex-workers 
have been enticed into the entertainment industry, it seems 
that others have, for now, just returned home to be 
re-assimilated into farm work or local cottage industries. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: SUPPORTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY: THE U.S. 
RECORD - BURMA 
 
REF: STATE 333953 
 
BEGIN TEXT: Burma continues to be ruled by a highly 
authoritarian military regime that reinforces its firm grip 
with a pervasive security apparatus.  The Government\'s 
extremely poor human rights record worsens and it continues 
to commit numerous serious abuses.  Citizens still do not 
have the right to change their government.  Security forces 
continue to commit extrajudicial killings and rape, forcibly 
relocate persons, use forced labor, conscript child soldiers, 
and has reestablished forced conscription of the civilian 
population into militia units.  During the year, 
government-affiliated agents may have killed possibly as many 
as 70 pro-democracy activists.  Disappearances continued, and 
members of the security forces tortured, beat, and otherwise 
abused prisoners and detainees. 
 
The United States, human rights and democracy strategy for 
Burma advocates respect for human rights and rapid political 
change.  We work with like-minded countries to maintain 
maximum international pressure on Burma, pending reform. 
That pressure includes a new prohibition on financial 
services, a new import ban, increased travel sanctions, and 
continued investment sanctions; the denial of any form of 
aid, with the exceptions of humanitarian assistance and 
support for democratic movements; continued public criticism 
of the Burmese regime; and public diplomacy programs focused 
on democratic values, human rights, and good governance.  It 
also includes support for international efforts to foster 
change in Burma, through the missions of UN Special Envoy 
Razali and UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Pinheiro, as 
well as the efforts of the International Labor Organization 
(ILO), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), 
and other international organizations. 
 
The United States, in coordination with the European Union 
(EU) and other states, has imposed numerous sanctions on 
Burma.  These U.S. sanctions include a ban on all financial 
services to Burma; a ban on all imports from Burma; an arms 
embargo; a ban on all new U.S. investment in Burma; the 
suspension of all bilateral aid, including counternarcotics 
assistance; the withdrawal of Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) privileges; the denial of Overseas Private 
Investment Corporation (OPIC) and EXIMBANK programs; visa 
restrictions on Burma\'s senior government officials; and 
opposition to all new lending or grant programs by the 
international financial institutions.  And since 1990, we 
have maintained our representation in Burma at the Charg 
d\'Affaires level. 
 
Burma continues to be hostile to all forms of political 
opposition.  The Government cracked down severely on the main 
opposition party in May 2003, killing possibly as many as 70 
democracy supporters, and shuttering all 300 opposition party 
offices in Burma.  The U.S. encourages UN efforts to free the 
approximately 150 incarcerated on May 30, as well as the 
pre-existing 1,300 political prisoners in Burma.  During 
travels throughout Burma, U.S. officials have also personally 
interviewed victims of political violence and facilitated 
access for other such U.S. investigations into human rights 
abuses. Furthermore, the USG maintains frequent contacts with 
influential members of the political opposition regarding 
initiatives that will affect the struggle for democracy in 
Burma. 
 
The U.S. Government promotes the rule of law and democracy by 
providing information exchange and civic education programs 
on human rights, democratic values, and governance issues. In 
2003, the U.S. dedicated over $200,000 to speaker programs, 
exchange programs, publications, and other information 
outreach. Furthermore, the USG\'s direct teaching program 
offers tuition waivers worth $9,555 to 35 students denied the 
opportunity to study because of their political beliefs.  In 
addition, we provided $4.0 million in support of the Burmese 
democratic opposition in Fiscal Year (FY) 2002. These funds 
are programmed through the National Endowment for Democracy 
(NED) and others and focus on democracy and capacity-building 
activities and on the collection and dissemination of 
information on democracy and human rights. 
 
The U.S. urged the Burmese regime, which does not allow 
domestic human rights groups to function independently and is 
hostile to outside scrutiny of its human rights record, to 
accept visits by international human rights organizations. 
Amnesty International completed its second visit to Burma in 
2003. 
 
The U.S. has co-sponsored annual resolutions at the UN 
General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights that 
highlight and draw international attention to the continued 
human rights violations in Burma.  The 2003 UNGA resolution 
adopted by consensus calls for an independent investigation 
of the May 2003 attack on the democratic opposition. 
 
The U.S. continued to encourage the GOB to allow workers\' 
rights and unions and to discontinue its use of forced labor. 
 We support the continuation of a liaison office of the ILO 
in Burma which made efforts to bring the Government into 
compliance with its international labor obligations. 
 
The U.S. approved $104,000 in FY04 funding for a trafficking 
in persons program to raise awareness among Burmese 
vulnerable to Burma-to-Thailand trafficking, and to support 
anti-trafficking efforts of local NGOs.  END TEXT.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/03/2014 
TAGS: EAID, PGOV, PREL, BM, UNICEF, NGO, Ethnics 
SUBJECT: FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF UNICEF BURMA 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Thirty-five percent of Burma\'s children 
are malnourished, while one out of ten dies by age five, 
according to UNICEF.  Emboff traveled with a UNICEF team to 
Karen and Mon States recently to observe UNICEF\'s field 
operations.  Embassy Rangoon is highly supportive of UNICEF\'s 
activities in Burma and hopes U.S. funding for these programs 
remains strong.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) ON THE ROAD WITH UNICEF: 
 
UNICEF works in 62 of Burma\'s 324 townships (counties) 
running projects targeting rural health, basic education, and 
water resources to help the country\'s vulnerable children. 
Emboff joined seven other diplomats, UNICEF\'s new Country 
Director, and local authorities in a visit to project sites 
in Mon State January 19 - 21.  Mon State, in southeastern 
Burma, is home to the Mon ethnic minority, which speaks a 
language in the Khmer family.  Mon State is relatively 
peaceful today, apart from some residual banditry/insurgency 
in its southern district.  We traversed parts of Karen State 
and noted that farms, villages, and towns there were visibly 
poorer and run down, probably a result of a half-century of 
civil strife. 
 
3.  (U) USE THE LATRINE, WASH YOUR HANDS 
 
One of UNICEF\'s major activities is helping community schools 
teach and practice \"The Four Cleans.\"  We visited several 
schools that had UNICEF-assisted potable water projects, 
sanitary latrines, and programs to teach students healthful 
habits regarding toilets, drinking water, clean hands, and 
safe food.  With diarrhea the second-leading killer of 
children after malaria, instilling even these health 
fundamentals can save lives. 
 
4.  (U) DIPLOMATS AGAINST BRAIN DAMAGE 
 
UNICEF has a very successful program to iodize Burma\'s salt 
supply.  The group visited a salt evaporation company and 
inspected the iodine-adding process.  Thanks to UNICEF\'s 
efforts, the majority of Burma\'s salt is iodized and the rate 
of goiter and related problems, including potential brain 
damage, is much reduced.  The company had white baseball caps 
printed for our visit with the admonition \"Prevent Brain 
Damage\" emblazoned across the front.  NOTE: This gaggle of 
diplomats probably caused some confusion and amusement among 
locals as we later visited many villages, all wearing our 
caps bearing this slogan. 
 
5.  (U) \"I visited a prostitute and now have AIDS\" 
 
UNICEF provides teachers in rural schools with training in 
special life skills dealing with sensitive issues like 
reproductive health and HIV/AIDS.  We witnessed a 
role-playing class in a middle school in which students were 
tasked with acting out difficult situations.  One seventh 
grader got up in front of his classmates and the foreign 
visitors and said, \"I went to the city last weekend.  While 
there I visited a prostitute.  Now I have AIDS.\"  The 
role-player hung his head in sadness, his classmates loudly 
applauded his presentation, he beamed, and sat down. 
 
6.  (SBU) A MON PTA 
 
We met with the Parent Teacher Association at Wargaru Primary 
School.  None of the parents spoke a word of Burmese, let 
alone English.  We had a spirited, thrice-translated 
discussion about their aspirations for the community, their 
families, and the school.  It was at this location our 
Burmese military escort got out of their trucks and deployed 
in defensive positions in the woods around the school.  None 
of the children spoke any Burmese when they started 
kindergarten.  None of the government-supplied teachers spoke 
Mon and there was no printed material in Mon in the school. 
We later visited the neighboring high school and saw a 
language lab and computer room donated by an expatriate Mon 
living in the United States.  The high school\'s students, 
despite starting school without speaking Burmese, scored much 
higher than average on the national high school exam. 
 
7.  (SBU/NF) VOLUNTEER \"MICROSCOPIST\" WANTS OUT 
 
UNICEF provides supplies and equipment (a traditional 
doctor\'s \"black bag,\" etc.) to volunteer midwives and 
volunteer health assistants in rural clinics who support the 
salaried nurses and rare doctors.  Nurses recently had their 
salaries doubled to about $10 per month; the volunteers work 
for tips.  We met one volunteer who was trained to work with 
a modern microscope to identify malaria in blood samples. 
She proudly showed off her microscope and rudimentary lab to 
the UNICEF group and accompanying GOB health officials. 
After the group moved on, two diplomats remained behind to 
examine the lab.  At that point the young microscopist 
grabbed both diplomats by the arm and pleaded in English, \"I 
want to go to another country.\" 
 
8.  (SBU/NF) COMMENT:  Unlike UNDP, UNICEF Burma is not 
prohibited from working with elements of the Government of 
Burma.  Indeed, targeting the health, education, and public 
water sectors almost by definition must involve at least 
local authorities.  UNICEF has been very effective in most of 
its programs, but had a reputation of being somewhat 
administratively lax.  This may have been due to its 
partnership with elements of the GOB (for some of which 
\"administratively lax\" would be a big improvement) or to past 
UNICEF management practices.  With a new, experienced Country 
Director on board, along with a new UN Resident Coordinator, 
we expect UNICEF to continue or expand its ongoing good 
works, while doing so in a shipshape manner.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: SPDC TRIES TO ENHANCE \"UNDERSTANDING\" OF BURMA 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: A two day seminar on \"Understanding Myanmar\" 
on January 27-28 was certainly the first time we have seen 
the government willing to discuss its policies in even a 
reasonably open forum.  However, few attendees took the 
opportunity to publicly push important issues with the often 
senior-level panelists.  All sessions were characterized by a 
lack of substantive presentations from the panels (expected) 
and generally laudatory remarks and overwhelming support of 
Burma\'s \"recent efforts\" by the non-diplomat conference 
attendees. The seminar was useful in some ways: we received a 
clearer picture of the purported mechanics of the roadmap; it 
illustrated that the comfort zone that the regime has 
constructed among its ASEAN neighbors and China, Japan, and 
India extends deeply into the academe of the region and it 
shows that in its own clumsy way, the regime sees the need 
for greater public relations efforts. END SUMMARY. 
 
Khin Nyunt - Ready for Prime Time 
 
2. (C) Before an audience of diplomats and carefully selected 
friendly academics from around the world, Prime Minister 
General Khin Nyunt kicked off a two-day conference on 
\"Understanding Myanmar\" on January 27.  The PM spoke in 
English, with a a TelePrompTer, and his message was heavy on 
unbelievable statistics purportedly demonstrating Burma\'s 
alleged advances in health care and higher education.  The PM 
also stressed the country\'s \"steady course in its effort to 
promote a market-oriented system in spite of the unilateral 
sanctions instituted by some Western countries.\"  The PM 
(resplendent in his military uniform and surrounded by a 
large entourage, many also in uniform) stressed familiar 
themes, such as the importance of national unity and peace 
and stability as prerequisites for a transition to a 
democratic system.  The PM took no questions after his circa 
20-minute speech, although, in somewhat presidential fashion, 
he remained in the meeting hall shaking hands and chatting 
with diplomats and academics amidst the glare of camera 
flashes (FYI: A reliable embassy contact with very good 
access to the highest levels of the SPDC told the COM later 
that the PM and his entourage had wanted to appear in 
national dress rather than military uniforms, but after an 
exhaustive attempt to convince Senior General Than Shwe of 
the public relations benefit of this tactic, he insisted on 
the military regalia). 
 
We Have the Roadmap - Here\'s How to Read It 
 
3. (U) Throughout the address on the regime\'s road map, 
\"Burma Road Map to Democracy: The Way Forward,\" presented by 
Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win, there was no specific 
mention at all of the NLD or its leader Aung San Suu Kyi 
(ASSK).  However, the DepForMin made what may have been the 
only direct allusion to the NLD and ASSK, noting that the 
previous National Convention had failed because of the 
\"activities of one person and one political party\". 
 
4. (U) The DepForMin mercifully did not read a prepared 
paper, instead speaking extemporaneously in English for 
around 40 minutes and smoothly, although superficially, 
addressing questions such as the significance of the road map 
(\"it is a demonstration of our commitment to democratic 
principles\"), timing for the National Convention (\"this 
year\"), and what Burma means by \"disciplined democracy\" (\"a 
democracy that does not adversely effect historical 
traditions or national unity\").  The DepForMin provided an 
outline of the envisioned future Burmese democratic state, 
which will include an executive president limited to two, 
five-year terms; a bicameral legislature, one elected by 
national vote and the other comprised of equal numbers of 
representatives from each of Burma\'s states; regional 
legislatures headed by Chief Ministers; and judicial organs 
at the center and in the regions.  The DepForMin asserted 
that Burma would not go back to a one-party state and would 
have a multi-party system based on the \"universal principles 
of liberty, justice and equality.\"  In regard to reconvening 
the National Convention, the DepForMin said that it would be 
a continuation of the previous one (a point he reiterated 
several times) and that its composition would not change.  In 
terms of party delegates, it would be entirely up to the 
individual parties to determine who to send to the reconvened 
Convention. 
 
5. (C) After the DepForMin concluded his presentation, there 
were several interventions in which participants from several 
ASEAN countries as well as China and Japan read universally 
laudatory prepared statements regarding the road map.  In the 
ensuing Q and A session, the COM asked the DepForMin what 
policies were being developed and what measures would be put 
in place to give its citizens the knowledge and confidence to 
express their needs and opinions in a free and open manner. 
But he was spared answering when the panel chairman declared 
the session closed.  During the break between sessions, the 
DepForMin told the COM he could not answer this publicly but 
there would be programs to advise the citizens of their right 
to express their opinions \"as long as they did not adversely 
affect the stability of the country.\" 
 
Peace and Stability - What It Takes to Get Them Back In the 
Fold 
 
6. (U) During the session on \"Efforts for the Prevalence of 
Peace and Stability\", Brigadier-General Kyaw Thein, the 
Office of the Chief of Military Intelligence Head of 
Department and chief interlocutor on drug issues, focused on 
what he described as the indispensable role of \"genuine\" 
peace mediators during the Government\'s negotiations with 
Burma\'s various insurgent groups.  In conclusion, Kyaw Thein 
stressed that success depended on the commitment of both 
sides and that the Government maintains an open door policy 
in regard to talking to remaining armed insurgent groups. 
One of the panelists, retired Professor U Htun Aung Chien, an 
ethnic Karen who was identified as having played a 
significant role in the KNU negotiations, made a number of 
interesting albeit vague remarks about the importance of both 
trust and \"gentleman\'s agreements\" in achieving positive 
results.  Neither the presenter nor the panelists mentioned 
the importance of a tripartite dialogue to the achievement of 
lasting peace or stability. 
 
Suppression of Narcotic Drugs - It\'s a Myanmar Problem 
 
7. (SBU) Perhaps the most professional and straightforward 
presentation was that of Police Colonel Hkam Awng, Joint 
Secretary of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse.  Col. Hkam 
 
SIPDIS 
Awng is our key police contact and has worked closely with 
DEA for many years.  His presentation, in nearly flawless 
English, relied on slides with statistics from the UNODC and 
the joint US/Burma opium yield surveys that have been taking 
place since 1993.  He emphasized that precursor chemicals for 
amphetamine and heroin production are not manufactured in 
Burma and that cultivation and production were steadily 
declining.  The presentation was notable in its emphasis on 
Burma\'s responsibility for the situation and for the detailed 
explanation of its efforts to combat its narcotics problem. 
There was little attempt to blame the US or other western 
countries.  The only reference to external influences was 
that \"...the much lower level of inflow of external 
assistance has\" not \"diminished Myanmar\'s determination\" to 
overcome the problem, and he asked that \"more and more 
countries...join hands with Myanmar.\" 
 
Foreign Relations -- Metaphors and Allusions 
 
9. (SBU) Director General of the MOFA\'s Political Department 
U Thaung Thun led the first session on January 28 on 
\"Priorities in Burma\'s Foreign Policy.\"  In contrast to the 
Deputy Foreign Minister\'s presentation the day before, the DG 
did not stray from his prepared remarks and gave little more 
than a historical overview of significant events in Burma\'s 
recent history, beginning with its loss of independence to 
the British.  The highlight was the somewhat dated example 
given to illustrate Burma\'s independent foreign policy -- the 
stand Burma took in 1956 UN voting on the Hungarian issue 
(pre-dating the military\'s seizure of power in 1962).  The DG 
did make several enigmatic and unscripted remarks during his 
speech, including, \"you can either have a beautiful mosaic or 
a house of Babel\" in regards to the national races issue and 
\"if it is true that whoever rules the heartland rules all, 
Burma is the heartland,\" during his comments on the strategic 
location of Burma between south and southeast Asia. 
 
How Many Bridges Does it take To Build an Economy? 
 
10. (C) The presentation on Burma\'s economic and development 
situation was equally fatuous.  The main speaker, the rector 
of Burma\'s Institute of Economics, turned in a superb 
performance as a talking head giving a stupefying 40 minute 
regurgitation of the SPDC\'s propaganda (roads and bridges 
equal development).  He insisted the current government had 
taken great strides in economic reform, but could only come 
up with one example -- the loosening of restrictions on the 
private sector for trading and exporting rice. 
Unfortunately, the SPDC had \"temporarily\" suspended this very 
liberalization not three weeks ago.  The most useful 
contribution came from one of the designated discussants who 
gingerly proposed that the private sector in Burma needs 
better \"enabling conditions and more stability\" and that 
Burma\'s system needs to provide a social safety net for 
people and for businesses that fail. 
 
The United Nations - Cooperation Burmese Style 
 
11. (SBU)  The MOFA\'s Director General for International 
Organizations and Economic Affairs U Win Mra gave a 
presentation on \"Cooperation with the United Nations.\"  He 
talked mostly about human rights rather than UN cooperation, 
bemoaning the \"undeserved\" foreign criticism of Burma\'s human 
rights record, clarifying for all that \"the Government 
protects human rights by providing food and shelter to the 
people.\"  U Win Mra proudly noted that Burma was the first 
country to sign the 1949 Universal Declaration on Human 
Rights, \"which forever associates Burma with the values of 
the declaration.\"  He neglected to mention that the 1949 
signature was made by a new democratic government.  The DG 
said globalization has brought exposure to human rights in 
the country, that it was impossible to even hold a discussion 
like this in the past, and that \"we are trying to change, 
step by step -- gradually.\"  On forced labor, U Win Mra 
announced the GOB has brought laws into line with 
international expectations, and will carry out the ILO\'s plan 
of action.  On AIDS, he took umbrage with outsiders who say 
\"we aren\'t giving enough money to fight HIV/AIDS -- we are!\" 
 
12. (C) Conveniently, the DG spoke so long that there was 
little time for real discussion or questions.  However, a 
Malaysian attendee managed to squeeze in a final word, 
lauding the GOB on its labor practices, asking \"why only now 
do other countries care about using porters when Asian 
militaries and the British used them for years.\"  When 
Emboffs buttonholed the DG after his presentation, U Win Mra 
agreed that it would be better for Burma if the GOB allowed 
diplomats and press to travel and report on what is really 
happening in the countryside, instead of forcing total 
reliance on Burmese exiles in Thailand for news.  Regarding 
the March release of the Human Rights Report on Burma, U Win 
Mra seemed genuinely interested in updating the Embassy next 
time around on positive actions the GOB has taken in reported 
cases of rapes in ethnic areas, but cautioned that the 
military doesn\'t want to be embarrassed by an international 
investigation such as the one Special Rapporteur Pinhiero has 
proposed. 
 
Human Rights - Nobody Likes Me, Everybody Hates Me... 
 
13. (C) The most disappointing and cliche\'d performance was 
that of Burma\'s Ambassador to the UK, Kyaw Win.  Rather than 
the theme of a Burma intent on pursuing an independent 
foreign policy and reliant on its own resources as set out by 
the Prime Minister and echoed in the presentations of the 
DepForMin and others, Ambassador Kyaw Win presented an 
endlessly detailed litany (complete with Power Point) of 
Burma\'s victimization by the US and others through a 
corruption of the mechanisms of the UN.  He also 
characterized political opposition to the regime as merely a 
\"reflection of the desires of western countries.\"  At the end 
of his presentation, a few very supportive interventions were 
allowed (one by a British invitee who lauded the government\'s 
strides in addressing the need for training in human rights, 
labor rights, etc., and the other a garment factory owner 
lambasting the US for the trade ban which he claimed 
destroyed his business), followed by an attempt to close the 
session quickly by eyeballing the audience and claiming there 
were obviously no questions. 
 
14.  (C) However, the COM and the UK Ambassador in Rangoon 
insisted on asking questions to the dismay of the session 
chair.  The COM asked Kyaw Win why his presentation, with its 
portrayal of Burma as a victim rather than as a country 
intent on pursuing an independent foreign policy, was so at 
odds with the vision presented by the Prime Minister and 
other members of the senior leadership.  Kyaw Win at first 
pretended he did not understand the question (he speaks 
flawless English) and when the COM repeated her question, he 
said he just wanted to \"explain the evolution of the UN 
process\" and would say no more.  The UK Ambassador then rose 
to challenge his point about the democratic opposition being 
a reflection of the West, pointing out that it was a 
reflection of the will of the Burmese people as expressed in 
the 1990 elections. The UK Ambassador also said she would 
welcome the chance to continue this debate in the session or 
in the press, noting that of course this would not be 
possible as there is no free press.  The session was 
immediately brought to a close. 
 
Comment 
 
16. (C) This was certainly the first time we\'ve seen the 
government willing to discuss its policies in even a 
reasonably open forum.  However, few attendees took the 
opportunity to publicly push important issues with the often 
senior-level panelists.  All sessions were characterized by a 
lack of substantive presentations from the panels (expected) 
and generally laudatory remarks and overwhelming support of 
Burma\'s \"recent efforts\" by the non-diplomat conference 
attendees (disappointing).  Although several academics asked 
questions and made minor suggestions which could have been 
construed as being (at least a teeny, weeny bit) critical of 
the regime there was no genuine dialogue or exchange of 
ideas. Even the Indian Ambassador, who can be counted on to 
be sympathetic to the regime\'s performances, remarked to the 
COM how \"inappropriate\" it was for the PM and his entourage 
to show up in uniform and behave as if it was a \"state 
occasion\" when the event was purported to be an academic 
seminar.  He also remarked that a conference on Burma during 
which no one mentioned the NLD or Aung San Suu Kyi was not a 
real conference. Burma specialist Dr. Robert Taylor commented 
that \"he had learned little\" from the seminar. Interestingly, 
many of us were apparently in a a different seminar from 
former UK Ambassador to Thailand Derek Tonkin, who made an 
intervention praising the seminar as \"the non-governmental 
face\" of the Bangkok Process, and as heralding a \"new dawn 
for democracy.\" 
 
17. (C) The seminar was useful in some ways: we received a 
clearer picture of the purported mechanics of the roadmap; it 
illustrates that the comfort zone that the regime has 
constructed among its ASEAN neighbors and China, Japan, and 
India includes academia as well as governments; and it shows 
that in their own clumsy way, the regime sees the need for 
public relations efforts.  It also shows that Senior General 
Than Shwe can tell PM Khin Nyunt what to wear.

1. (SBU) Summary: Burma does not have any reported cases of 
avian flu.  Though the government is taking precautionary 
measures (ref B), if an outbreak were to occur the regime 
would be ill-prepared to face it.  However, even if the worst 
happens, due to current USG Burma policy it\'s unlikely that 
we\'d have any room to provide direct assistance.  End summary. 
 
Burma Still Has No Flu 
 
2. (U) Ref A request for information indicated that Burma was 
currently affected by one of the strains of avian influenza 
currently sweeping Asia.  As reported in ref B, and verified 
with local WHO officials on February 4th, to the best of 
anyone\'s knowledge this is not/not the case.  The Burmese 
government has not yet reported any cases of avian flu among 
its large flock of domestic and imported chickens. 
 
3. (U) As reported in ref B, the GOB has taken a number of 
actions including launching a public education campaign and 
freezing imports of chickens from Thailand unless they are 
cleared by the Burmese Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries 
(MOLF).  MOLF together with the Ministry of Health is also 
prepared to use MOLF\'s antiquated veterinary testing 
facilities to test any sick birds from private farms and from 
government chicken farms run by the Myanmar Farm Enterprise. 
However, the GOB has not yet begun any culling of domestic or 
previously imported chickens.  We have not heard that MOLF is 
vaccinating chickens. 
 
Comment: Poorly Prepared, But We Can\'t Help 
 
4. (SBU) As we mentioned in reftel, the government\'s secrecy 
reflex and the difficulty of getting accurate news from the 
provinces will make it tough for us and the WHO to ever be 
\"absolutely certain\" that avian flu is not in Burma. It is a 
concern, however, as Burma\'s inadequate medical 
infrastructure (for both man and beast) would be very hard 
pressed to effectively contain any new epidemic.  Likewise, 
it is very unlikely that the GOB will provide adequate 
equipment or training for personnel assigned to taking care 
of the problem.  However, we note that whatever the situation 
with Burma\'s chickens, and with the GOB\'s capacity to handle 
an outbreak, current U.S. policy would make any direct USG 
assistance to address the problem extremely unlikely.  End 
comment.

1. (C) Summary:  On the heels of a cease-fire agreement 
between the Burmese regime and the insurgent Karen National 
Union (KNU), the UNHCR will sign an agreement with the GOB 
o/a February 13 allowing unprecedented access to former 
conflict areas along the Burma-Thailand border.  UNHCR plans 
to assess current conditions in Karen (Kayin) and Mon States 
and in Tenasserim (Tanintharyi) Division with a view to 
determining future needs for the hypothetical resettlement 
and repatriation of several hundred thousand refugees and 
IDPs.  UNHCR and the GOB, however, are anxious to quell 
rumors that repatriation or resettlement is imminent.  UNHCR, 
in fact, believes that conditions in the eastern border 
region are currently far from conducive for the return of 
displaced persons to their homes.  Meanwhile, in western 
Burma, resettlement of Muslim Rohingya refugees is nearing 
completion, but the SPDC continues to treat this 
long-suffering population as third-class citizens.  End 
Summary. 
 
An Agreement in Principle 
------------------------- 
 
2. (C) UNHCR representative Rajiv Kapur called on COM and P/E 
chief February 5 to explain recent developments that led to 
an \"agreement in principle\" with the GOB that will permit 
UNHCR unprecedented access to former conflict areas in Karen 
(Kayin) and Mon States and in Tenasserim Division.  Jean 
Marie Fakhouri, UNHCR Director for Asia and the Pacific, will 
visit Burma February 12-14 to sign the final agreement. 
 
3. (C) Kapur said that UNHCR has been pushing for access to 
the eastern border areas for the past three years.  The 
region, rife with insurgent activity for decades, has 
produced hundreds of thousands of internally displaced 
persons and refugees who have fled to neighboring Thailand. 
UNHCR has been anxious to assess conditions for eventual 
repatriation operations, but the SPDC has long considered 
much of the region highly sensitive and strictly off limits 
to diplomats, NGOs, and international organizations.  Indeed, 
Kayah State is still considered sensitive and will not be 
included in the UNHCR agreement. 
 
The Boss Weighs In 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) According to Kapur, key senior GOB officials are 
worried about rumors that UNHCR will soon close its Burma 
operations upon completion of resettlement activities in 
Rahkine (Arakan) State on the western border with Bangladesh. 
 Given the massive refugee problem on Burma\'s eastern 
borders, these officials are keen to keep UNHCR active in 
Burma and demonstrate GOB cooperation with the international 
community.  Rajiv confided to us that he did not discourage 
the rumors of a UNHCR pullout, because he believes that it is 
essential to get into the East, especially Mon and Karen 
States. 
 
5. (C) The issue of UNHCR access to the East came to a head 
in mid-January, following the SPDC\'s substantial progress in 
cease-fire talks with the rebel Karen National Union (KNU) 
(reftel).  Kapur said that the SPDC/GOB was split on allowing 
the UNHCR short-term access, with the Ministries of 
Immigration and Foreign Affairs in opposition due to their 
concerns over UNHCR\'s leading role on protection issues. 
According to Kapur, Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt made 
the call in favor of UNHCR and directed the Minister of Home 
Affairs to provide full support.  This was followed by a late 
night exchange of letters between the Home Ministry and 
UNHCR, culminating in an \"agreement in principle.\"  However, 
Khin Nyunt has instructed his deputies to ensure that the 
arrangement with the UNHCR \"does not complicate talks with 
the KNU.\" 
 
Don\'t Open the Floodgates - Yet 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Kapur stressed that UNHCR does not plan to establish 
field offices, as this might entice Thailand to prematurely 
\"encourage\" refugees to return to Burma (note: Kapur said 
that the RTG is already \"spreading the word\" that the UNHCR 
has an access deal with the GOB, giving some the false 
impression that there is already a repatriation agreement in 
place.  \"We must rein in the Thai,\" said the UNHCR 
representative.  End note).  UNHCR\'s intentions are to send 
assessment teams into the eastern border region to establish 
a full understanding of current conditions, to determine 
future needs for hypothetical resettlement (protection 
monitoring, health centers, etc), and to develop a 
repatriation plan should the GOB pursue one at a later date. 
 
7. (C) The final agreement signed next week will give UNHCR 
full access to the region, including the ability to establish 
future operational bases in the population centers of Pa\'an, 
Tavoy, Myawaddy, and Mudon.  Kapur said that UNHCR has built 
a detailed database on Thailand-based refugees and has a 
decent idea of where most repatriated refugees would intend 
to resettle.  However, he added, the situation is 
particularly complex because many Karen refugees originally 
fled from Irrawaddy (Ayeyarwady) and Bago Divisions (further 
west, now predominantly ethnic-Burman areas) in which the 
SPDC is highly unlikely to allow refugees to resettle. 
 
8. (C) Kapur said that repatriation and resettlement in the 
eastern region will be very difficult due to the large 
numbers involved and the extremely isolated and difficult 
terrain.  Furthermore, much of the territory suffers from the 
ravages of war and neglect, including substantial land mines. 
 
9. (C) According to Kapur, UNHCR will make an appeal to 
donors for a \"supplementary operation\" budget to conduct the 
UNHCR assessment in the eastern border areas.  He said the 
refugee organization wants \"to start small and just get some 
people on the ground.\"  UNHCR has not yet developed a full 
budget, but he expects the initial appeal would be for about 
$1 million and would target current donors who already 
support operations in Rahkine (Arakan) State including the 
United States, the UK, and the Scandinavians. 
 
Meanwhile, on the Western Front... 
---------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) At the end of our meeting, Kapur briefly addressed 
the situation in Rahkine (Arakan) State.  He said that UNHCR 
hopes to tackle the Burma-Thailand border refugee problem 
with its experience in successfully repatriating over 236,000 
Muslim Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh to western Burma. 
He said the GOB has become increasingly flexible with the 
Rohingyas, noting that UNHCR has succeeded in obtaining 
residency cards and Burmese language instruction for 
returnees as a way to help meet requirements for future 
citizenship. Very few refugees who want to return to Burma, 
Kapur said, remain in Bangladesh. 
 
11. (C) However, Kapur acknowledged there has been no 
progress in establishing freedom of movement for the 
returnees and, overall, the GOB continues to treat them as 
third-class citizens.  \"The SPDC wants to keep the Muslims in 
check, but they are in fact creating ripe conditions for 
extremists.\"  Furthermore, Kapur claimed, the GOB has been 
actively spreading propaganda among the predominantly Muslim 
returnee population, claiming that \"the United States is 
carrying out a plot to create tensions between Buddhists and 
Muslims in Burma as a way to destabilize the country.\"  Kapur 
said that senior SPDC officials have been engaged in 
perpetuating these claims, including an unnamed Major General 
who recently visited northern Rahkine (Arakan) State. 
 
Comment: Rare Access 
-------------------- 
 
12. (C) At the end of February, we hope to join UNHCR on a 
three-day visit to the western border of Rahkine (Arakan) 
State for a closer view of repatriation operations.  However, 
our general view is that UNHCR has been doing important work 
in Burma, particularly on protection and other human rights 
issues.  We would encourage PRM and the Department to respond 
favorably to an appeal to support an assessment of the 
eastern border region.  Few outsiders have had access to 
these areas over past decades and UNHCR will have the 
opportunity to make important recommendations on the future 
of several hundred thousand displaced persons.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S BANKS: THE YELLOW FLAG IS LIFTED 
 
REF: 03 RANGOON 1164 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: After months of speculation and rumor the 
government has allowed three of the country\'s six biggest 
private banks to resume operations -- albeit under strict new 
regs and a promise to roll heads if there are any foul ups. 
Though some of the new regulations are sound, others are 
overly rigid and punitive.  Likewise, the future of the 
country\'s two largest banks, not included in the 
liberalization, remains in limbo.  Thus we are skeptical that 
the government\'s move will prime the pump and get large 
amounts of money flowing into the economy through the private 
banks.  End summary. 
 
Don\'t Mess This Up 
 
2. (SBU) With a stern warning to fly right this time, or 
else, the GOB on February 3 allowed three private banks to 
resume operations.  The three banks, Kanbawza, Myanmar 
Universal, and Myanmar Oriental, were the third, fifth, and 
sixth of the \"Big Six\" banks (by deposit size).  They have 
been inactive since the government effectively shuttered them 
following a disastrous run on private banks in February 2003. 
 The three other large banks, two of which are under 
investigation for money laundering and ties to 
narcotrafficking, remain under wraps with no word as to their 
ultimate fate.  Fourteen other very small private banks have 
been operating relatively freely for several months now, 
though without official government sanction.  These small 
banks were not mentioned in the amnesty, though we expect 
them to continue their low level business. 
 
3. (SBU) The decision to release the three banks has been 
rumored to be in the works for nearly six months now (see 
reftel) and it is unclear why the Bank Supervisory Committee, 
responsible for \"resolving\" the banking crisis, took so long 
to fire the starter\'s gun.  The newly freed banks will be 
forced to abide by a long list of stringent new requirements, 
though, some of which were discussed previously (reftel) and 
some that are new. 
 
The New Law of the Land 
 
4. (SBU) The new regulations aim to keep a bank from getting 
too large and powerful and to limit a customer\'s ability to 
quickly move money in and out of the banks.  Some of the regs 
are quite responsible, but others may prove too rigid to 
allow profitable and customer-friendly banking.  We are also 
disappointed to see the government has apparently not 
reformed its own arcane banking regulations, which, in part, 
encouraged the type of profligate lending and dealings that 
led to the crash in the first place. 
 
5. (SBU) The regulations governing the three banks are as 
follows: 
 
-- (1) Deposits may not exceed seven times paid-up capital. 
If regulators find a violation of this, the bank must pay a 
fine equal to 2 percent of the excess amount; 
-- (2) Banks are no longer allowed to accept \"hot money\" call 
deposits (Note: these were very popular with banks, and 
depositors, as they offered an annual 4-10 percent interest 
rate, compounded daily, with no restrictions on withdrawals. 
End note.); 
-- (3) Savings account customers can make only one withdrawal 
and one deposit per week, though the amount is unlimited; 
-- (4) Fixed deposit terms are now three, six, nine, and 
twelve months.  Prior to the crash the terms were one, two, 
three, and four weeks; 
-- (5) Interbank borrowing is prohibited; 
-- (6) Lending must be based on \"strong\" collateral (not 
further defined except to prohibit the use of gold and 
jewelry); 
-- (7) Banks may not lend to their own directors or 
directors\' spouses or these people\'s affiliated companies; 
-- (8) Banks must appoint loan inspectors and \"arrange to 
prosecute\" those who fail to repay loans (Note: the 
government\'s responsibility in these areas is not clarified. 
End note.); 
-- (9) Banks may not offer credit card services; 
-- (10) Banks must maintain a liquidity ratio of at least 20 
percent, a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10 percent, and 
a loan/deposit ratio of between 70 and 80 percent.  These 
last requirements existed prior to the 2003 crash, but were 
poorly enforced. 
 
Comment: Banks Just Happy to Be Alive 
 
6. (SBU) Bankers with whom we spoke were pleased to be 
allowed to resume their business no matter the new 
restrictions.  However, when pressed they admitted they were 
not very optimistic that the new, more restrictive, 
environment would allow them to attract back the customers 
who fled during the crash and subsequent mishandling of the 
crisis by the government.  In the first day after re-opening 
there were many customers -- to date prevented by government 
regulation from withdrawing more than 100,000 kyat per week 
($115) -- who rushed in to clean out their accounts.  On the 
macro level, we don\'t think the re-opening of these three 
banks will have much lubricating influence on the country\'s 
decrepit economy.  Though included in the \"Big Six,\" these 
banks held only a tiny percentage of the deposits and loans 
compared to the country\'s two largest, still embattled, banks 
-- Asia Wealth and Yoma.  End comment.

SUBJECT: SPDC STILL ARRESTING NLD MEMBERS 
 
REF: RANGOON 91 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Despite talk of a \"new year of 
transition,\" the SPDC has perpetuated old habits by 
continuing to arrest NLD members for conducting peaceful 
political activities.  These latest arrests, over a dozen 
total, stand in contrast to reports of an on-going dialogue 
between ASSK and the SPDC aimed at the short-term objective 
of releasing all remaining post-Depeyin NLD prisoners.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) According to Embassy and National League for Democracy 
(NLD) sources, the SPDC\'s Office of the Chief of Military 
Intelligence (OCMI) has arrested numerous NLD members in 
recent weeks.  On January 4, MI agents in Rangoon Division 
arrested U Myint Aye, NLD Chairman of Kyimaingdaing Township, 
and U Tin Maung Kyi, a local youth organizer.  The two were 
reportedly rounded up for the illegal distribution of over 
3,000 Burmese language copies of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, originally provided by the UNDP.  The NLD 
believes that OCMI\'s \"Unit 7\" interrogated the two men and 
then transferred them to Rangoon\'s Insein Prison, before 
releasing them to NLD CEC member U Nyunt Wei in early 
February. 
 
3. (C) Sources also indicate that OCMI arrested NLD youth 
leader Myint Ngwe in Yenanchaung Township (Magwe Division) on 
January 21 for the unauthorized distribution of leaflets on 
HIV/AIDS.  On January 30 and 31, respectively, OCMI arrested 
Maung Maung Kyaw Aye, NLD Secretary of Dabnon Township and U 
May, NLD Chair of Htantapin Township (Rangoon Division), for 
unknown reasons. 
 
4. (SBU) On February 11, OCMI arrested seven NLD members in 
Bogalay Township (Irrawaddy Division) for allegedly planning 
NLD party ceremonies to commemorate Union Day on February 12. 
 MI agents picked up one of the seven members when he 
returned from Rangoon to Bogalay with the NLD\'s Union Day 
statement. 
 
5.  (C) COMMENT:  The SPDC made loud noises in mid-January to 
draw attention to their release of 26 NLD members imprisoned 
in connection with the May 2003 attack on ASSK and her NLD 
convoy.  The act was gratuitous, as none of those released 
had ever been officially charged, but led some observers to 
believe that the regime was beginning to ease up on the 
pro-democracy movement.  Old habits die hard, however, and 
these latest arrests are further indication that the SPDC has 
little intention of giving the NLD any genuine breathing room 
to function as a political party.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) Summary:  The Burmese regime has transferred 77 
year-old NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo from a remote prison cell 
in northwest Burma to house arrest in Rangoon.  All NLD 
members detained for direct participation in the May 2003 NLD 
convoy have now been released from prison.  However, along 
with U Tin Oo, senior NLD leaders ASSK, U Aung Shwe, and U 
Lwin remain under house arrest (neither of the latter two 
were part of the convoy).  Some of those released may have 
been re-arrested in recent weeks and many NLD members rounded 
up in the aftermath of the convoy attack linger in prison 
cells.  U Tin Oo\'s transfer, after more than eight months of 
prison internment, is a positive development and a likely 
product of an ongoing dialogue between the regime and ASSK. 
However, USG and international pressure played a role and we 
will continue to press the regime for the full release of all 
NLD detainees and all political prisoners.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) According to NLD and GOB sources, over the weekend 
of February 13-14 regime authorities transferred National 
League for Democracy (NLD) Vice Chairman U Tin Oo from a 
prison cell in remote northwest Burma to his residence in 
central Rangoon.  After a two-day journey in the custody of 
security officials, he arrived at his home at about 6:00 p.m. 
on Saturday February 14 where he now remains under house 
arrest. 
 
3. (C) Emboffs visited U Tin Oo\'s house on the morning of 
Sunday February 15.  Security was tight at the house, with 
numerous armed soldiers and plainclothes military 
intelligence agents on the scene.  A mid-level officer from 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also present.  He 
indicated that central authorities had expected U.S. mission 
representatives to make an early visit to U Tin Oo\'s house 
and subsequently directed MOFA to dispatch an officer to run 
interference with any diplomats who sought a meeting with the 
NLD leader. 
 
4. (C) Officials on the scene at U Tin Oo\'s house denied our 
request to see the NLD leader or his wife.  We offered that a 
quick opportunity to say hello, even in the presence of 
authorities, could address local speculation that U Tin Oo is 
in poor health.  The MOFA official agreed with the merits of 
the proposal, but pleaded that he was \"just doing his job\" 
and had strict orders to bar any visitors from seeing U Tin 
Oo or entering the residential compound.  MI agents at the 
house asserted that U Tin Oo had arrived the evening before 
and the agents claimed that he was in good health. 
 
5. (SBU) Authorities originally arrested U Tin Oo during the 
night of May 30-31, 2003 following a premeditated attack on 
NLD General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) and her convoy 
in southern Sagaing Division.  U Tin Oo and ASSK were 
co-leaders of the month-long convoy that visited NLD party 
offices and supporters throughout central and northern Burma. 
 U Tin Oo has spent the eight and a half intervening months 
in a prison cell in Kale (Kalay), located in remote northwest 
Sagaing Division.  Over the past few months authorities had 
already released all other NLD members also detained on May 
30-31 and imprisoned with U Tin Oo at the Kale prison (reftel 
a and b). 
 
6. (SBU) According to official GOB figures, corroborated by 
the NLD, all NLD members detained for direct participation in 
the May 30 convoy (approximately 151 individuals) have now 
been released from prison and only U Tin Oo and ASSK remain 
under house arrest.  However, dozens or perhaps several 
hundred NLD party members and supporters detained during a 
nationwide crackdown in the aftermath of the convoy assault 
may still linger in prison cells without official charges. 
NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe and NLD Secretary/Spokesman U Lwin, 
who did not participate in the May 2003 convoy, also remain 
under house arrest in Rangoon.  According to several sources, 
authorities may have also re-arrested a handful of the 
released convoy participants in recent weeks. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  U Tin Oo\'s transfer to house arrest is a 
positive development.  His family, deeply concerned over his 
isolation in Sagaing Division and the impact of the attack 
and detention on his health, is extremely relieved to have 
him home.  We suspect that the transfer is the product of an 
ongoing dialogue between the regime and ASSK.  However, USG 
and international concern and pressure clearly played a 
significant role and we will continue to press the regime for 
the full release of the entire NLD leadership as well as the 
country\'s 1,300 political prisoners.  End Comment.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  The GOB celebrated Burma\'s 57th Union Day 
with an official ceremony in Rangoon\'s People\'s Square, 
attended by high-level SPDC officials and their faithful 
minions.  Diplomats were invited to a low-key MOFA event 
co-hosted by the Myanmar Asean Women\'s Friendship 
Association.  The NLD held a morning observance at a local 
pagoda and then, in defiance of local authorities, marched in 
formation to the party\'s de facto national headquarters.  The 
leading ethnic democracy coalition, the United Nationalities 
Alliance (UNA), hosted a commemorative dinner that attracted 
cease-fire groups and the NLD CEC.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NLD: At the Pagoda, in the Street, and on the Stump 
 
2. (C) The NLD began its parallel Union Day commemoration on 
February 12 with a morning religious ceremony at the Sasana 
Gonyi Monastery, on the grounds of ASSK\'s favorite Rangoon 
pagoda.  The five released members of the NLD\'s Central 
Executive Committee (CEC), representatives from the Committee 
to Represent the People\'s Parliament, U.S. and British 
diplomats, and about 400 NLD members attended the ceremony. 
 
3. (C) At noon, all of the NLD members queued in pairs and 
marched peacefully several miles to CEC member U Than Tun\'s 
residence -- the NLD\'s de facto national headquarters.  A 
truckload of military intelligence agents, police officers, 
and a local township SPDC official closely followed the 
procession, but did not interfere.  OCMI photographers 
stationed every 50 meters along the route thoroughly 
documented the march with their long lenses. 
 
4.  (C) Upon the procession\'s arrival at U Than Tun\'s 
residence, CEC member U Soe Myint called for the release of 
ASSK and other detained NLD leaders and demanded that the GOB 
allow the five CEC members to meet ASSK at the earliest 
opportunity.  MP-elect U Khun Myint Tun from Thaton Township, 
Mon State, read out the NLD\'s Union Day statement, calling 
for \"the unity of all ethnic nationalities\" and reiterating 
NLD policies of equality, autonomy, and cultural freedom. 
 
Ethnics: Dinner With the UNA 
 
5.  (C) On the evening of Union Day, Shan Nationalities 
League for Democracy (SNLD) Chairman Hkun Htun Oo hosted a 
dinner for the ethnic democracy coalition, the United 
Nationalities Alliance (UNA).  The event was attended by 
about 75 representatives from Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin 
Zomi, Mon, Burman, Rahkine, and Shan political parties, as 
well as political veterans, the NLD CEC, NLD MP\'s-elect, and 
U.S. Embassy representatives.  Notably, this was the first 
time that major cease fire groups such as the KIO and the 
NMSP attended a political function with elected 
representatives of the political parties. 
 
6. (SBU) The UNA distributed a statement calling for the 
release of political prisoners and a tripartite dialogue 
among the SPDC, the NLD, and ethnic groups as called for by 
the UNGA.  The ethnics talked about a \"second Panlong 
agreement,\" referring to the 1947 agreement reached between 
General Aung San and the ethnic minority groups.  A Kachin 
representative commented that the SPDC will go forward with 
the road map and those who do not participate will be left 
behind. 
 
Government: A Ceremonial Hoist 
 
7.  (C) The GOB held its official Union Day ceremony by 
hoisting the union flag at City Hall and holding an ethnic 
parade for selected guests at the People\'s Park.  Among those 
invited were core USDA members and representatives of the 
election commission and sundry National Convention 
committees.  In typical fashion for major national holidays, 
members of the general public were prohibited from attending 
and security was tight.  Rangoon Division\'s SPDC military 
commander read a statement from SPDC Chairman Senior General 
Than Shwe urging support for the regime\'s road map.  The 
Chairman himself later hosted a state dinner and 
uncharacteristically skipped his uniform and wore a 
traditional longyi and a traditional Burmese headdress. 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  The NLD road march from the pagoda and the 
public reading was a brave pushing-of-the-envelope, and it 
was good  to see that the SPDC may be giving the NLD a tiny 
bit more latitude to operate.  However, it would be worse for 
the democracy movement if the now-free CEC members were again 
imprisoned.  The well attended UNA dinner highlights the 
level of cooperation ethnic nationalities have with each 
other and with the cease-fire groups and the NLD.  END 
COMMENT.

REF: RANGOON 172 
 
1.  (SBU) UNHCR Director for Asia and the Pacific, Mr. Jean 
Marie Fakhouri, told Rangoon diplomatic corps February 13 
that the GOB was giving UNHCR the green light to enter Karen 
(Kayin) State, Mon State, and Tenasserim (Tanintharyi) 
Division and conduct limited operations beginning March 1. 
Fakhouri corroborated the details of the operations as 
foreshadowed by UNHCR Country Representative to COM on Feb 5 
(reftel).  He highlighted that initial operations will be 
limited to \"roving presence\" UNHCR teams that will assess 
infrastructure upgrades required to support the possible 
return of Karen refugees and IDPs. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Fakhouri explained that UNHCR wants to dampen Thai 
hopes for quick refugee returns to Burma and is focused on 
avoiding a repeat of the 1996 rushed return of Mon refugees 
following the New Mon State Party cease-fire.  Fakhouri 
estimated UNHCR will need $800,000 to $1 million this year 
for the Phase 1 roving presence operations, and will brief 
donors once back in Geneva.  Fakhouri also expressed concern 
about the pervasive mine problem in the region.

SUBJECT: IN SEARCH OF PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT: THANLYIN AND 
KYAUKTAN 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: A recent trip to Prime Minister General 
Khin Nyunt\'s home region of Kyauktan and Thanlyin (previously 
called Syriam), only a 45-minute jaunt southwest of downtown 
Rangoon, proved once again that kinship in this 
patronage-rich society has its privileges.  The region is 
still very underdeveloped and agrarian, however there are a 
number of incongruous development projects that are 
magnificent and idle memorials to the largesse of its 
favorite son.  Though only a small corner of the country, the 
region displays aspects of the GOB\'s economic development 
strategy evident countrywide: a \"bigger is better\" approach 
to infrastructure, pork barrel spending, a pervasive Chinese 
influence, and neglect of existing industries.  End summary. 
 
Thanlyin: The Company Town 
 
2. (SBU) A first stop in Thanlyin, the capital of southern 
Rangoon (Yangon) Division, revealed an aging company town 
with few economic prospects.  Nearly everyone in the city is 
employed by one of several state-owned enterprises -- a glass 
bottle factory, a tin processing plant, a steel processing 
plant, several technical universities, and a GOB garment JV 
with Daewoo.  The largest employer is, and has been for 
nearly a century, an oil refinery -- the second largest in 
Burma.  The refinery, first operated by the British, can 
process about 650,000 gallons per day though it rarely 
operates at capacity.  There is also a large naval shipyard 
and base between Thanlyin and Kyauktan, but locals say that 
it is staffed entirely by naval officials brought in from 
outside the region. 
 
Thilawa Port: Style Over Substance 
 
3. (SBU) The private sector has barely set foot in Thanlyin, 
although it is very close to the capital over a bridge newly 
built by the Chinese and even closer to the country\'s largest 
container port, Thilawa, located between Thanlyin and 
Kyauktan and completed in 1997 also with Chinese assistance. 
Though able to handle three large container ships at one 
time, a port official admitted that during boom times the 
gigantic and modern facility handles only two ships a month. 
The overgrown train tracks emanating from the port emphasize 
this point.  When we were there a small Bangladeshi grain 
vessel was in port but no activity was visible.  Traders and 
shippers in Rangoon say the ports along Rangoon\'s river front 
are smaller but far busier and more convenient for access 
into the city and beyond.  The Thilawa port, they claim, is 
too far from any industry or consumers to be a logical option. 
 
Kyauktan: A Pilgrimage to Khin Nyunt\'s Hometown 
 
4. (SBU) Khin Nyunt\'s actual birthplace, the riverside town 
of Kyauktan, is still quite rural with an economy based on 
agriculture, shrimp farming, fish drying, and tourism -- a 
famous floating pagoda lies just offshore.  Thanlyin natives 
gripe that since Khin Nyunt rose to prominence in 1988, juicy 
development projects have bypassed the larger town in favor 
of Kyauktan.  Indeed, Kyauktan\'s roads and public buildings 
are far newer and better maintained than in other small towns 
in the region and a cell phone tower, a very rare commodity 
outside Rangoon proper, dominates the town\'s skyline. 
 
5. (SBU) Nonetheless, Kyauktan again proves that public works 
projects alone do not make economic development.  Near 
Thilawa port, SPDC favorite Asia World Co. (the conglomerate 
founded in the 1990s by ethnic Kokang drug lord Lo Hsing Han) 
has built a network of well-paved roads with grassy medians 
passing through a vast \"development zone.\"  As far as we 
could tell the zone is currently populated by a single 
unfinished and apparently abandoned wire factory, a number of 
tumbledown huts, and dozens of stray dogs.  Likewise, in town 
we saw a spanking new \"e-library\" that had been \"donated\" to 
General Khin Nyunt by sycophants at the Union of Myanmar 
Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry.  The library 
building is nice and has five new computers available for 
use.  However, no \"e\" is available -- neither Internet access 
nor, quite often, electricity.  Would-be computer geeks are, 
however, able to borrow any one of a hundred pirated software 
titles including English and Chinese language CDs and at 
least two \"How to be a Hacker\" instructional discs. 
 
In Khin Nyunt\'s House There are Many Mansions... 
 
6. (SBU) Religious harmony, a theme we\'ve noticed elsewhere 
on our travels, appeared to repeat itself in Thanlyin and 
Kyauktan.  Although Buddhist structures were clearly dominant 
and better maintained, Catholic and Protestant churches exist 
alongside mosques and an internationally renowned Buddhist 
meditation center.  At a 400-year old mosque in Thanlyin, one 
Muslim official told us that in the region the majority 
Buddhists get along quite well with the large Muslim 
minority.  There were no incidents of violence here during 
the inter-religious disturbances that flared up in Rangoon 
last October and November. He said that the government fears 
the size and power of the Muslim community in Thanlyin and 
thus does not harass it or enforce laws forbidding the 
renovation of non-Buddhist religious structures. 
 
Comment: One Economic Development Plan Fits All 
 
7. (SBU) The economic situation and various development 
projects in Thanlyin and Kyauktan illustrate some important 
points about the GOB\'s current development \"strategy.\" 
First, projects like Thilawa port symbolize the GOB\'s 
obsession with huge infrastructure projects, completed for 
the glory of the country regardless of cost or usefulness. 
Second, the port and the Thanlyin-Rangoon bridge reiterate 
the pervasiveness of Chinese investment and assistance in 
these type of grandiose, but economically questionable, 
projects.  Third, the location of these infrastructure 
projects alongside the Asia World \"development zone\" and the 
\"e-library\" show the nature of the pork barrel spending in 
Burma, where the hometowns of the senior leadership get 
priority regardless of appropriateness.  Finally, the sad 
state of Thanlyin\'s major state-owned, potentially 
profitable, industries is a typical result of SPDC 
development priorities that focus on newness and flash rather 
than strengthening or rationalizing boring old existing 
industries.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The five free members of the NLD\'s Central 
Executive Committee (CEC) attempted on February 17 to visit 
Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) at her Rangoon residence, where she 
is under house arrest, but were rebuffed by the Burmese 
regime.  The \"uncles\" have in recent weeks taken a more 
visible and proactive role in leading party activities, 
including a quiet march on Union Day, meetings with 
diplomats, and correspondence with the regime that demands 
the release of NLD leaders and space to operate as a 
political party.  The regime responded with veiled threats 
directed at the uncles and cut their phone lines, but has 
otherwise turned a blind eye to their activities.  As for the 
regime\'s road map and a renewed National Convention, the CEC 
says \"been there, done that\" but refuses to take a public 
stand until ASSK and their other colleagues are released. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) We spoke on February 19 with NLD Central Executive 
Committee member U Nyunt Wei, who gave us detailed background 
regarding an unsuccessful attempt on February 17 by the five 
released members of the NLD CEC to visit ASSK, who remains 
under house arrest at her University Avenue residence in 
Rangoon.  The CEC has been increasingly visible in recent 
weeks, including a successful effort at leading a quiet 
procession of party members and supporters through a portion 
of central Rangoon on Union Day (ref A).  (Note:  Of the 
nine-member CEC, five were freed from house arrest in 
November, while the most senior four members, including ASSK, 
remain in detention.  End note.) 
 
It\'s In the Mail 
---------------- 
 
3. (C) According to U Nyunt Wei, the NLD CEC had in recent 
months written three consecutive letters to SPDC Chairman 
Senior General Than Shwe and PM General Khin Nyunt.  The 
first two letters appealed for the release of ASSK and other 
NLD leaders detained without charges and requested an 
opportunity to visit ASSK at her home.  Their third and most 
recent letter, delivered in early February, specified to the 
SPDC leaders that the NLD CEC wanted to speak with ASSK about 
top-level party matters.  The NLD CEC has received no 
response to any of their letters. 
 
4. (C) Parallel to their latest letter, the NLD \"uncles\" told 
an SPDC intermediary that they planned to make a unilateral 
visit to ASSK\'s residence in the absence of a timely response 
to their request.  The intermediary, a Burmese Army major, 
pleaded with the uncles not to proceed and promised he would 
report their concerns to his chain of command.  However, U 
Nyunt Wei said, the uncles replied that \"we won\'t wait 
indefinitely.\" 
 
University Avenue Breakdown 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (C) On the morning of February 17, having received no 
response from the SPDC, the five elderly uncles flagged down 
two taxicabs and headed for University Avenue.  U Nyunt Wei 
recounted with delight that the two cabbies, recognizing the 
uncles and their famous destination, refused to accept cab 
fare.  Arriving at ASSK\'s heavily guarded compound at around 
11:00 a.m., the uncles were seated across the street while 
military intelligence (MI) agents fetched a more senior-level 
interlocutor.  The regime officer who appeared apologized to 
the uncles, but said that no visitors were allowed to enter 
ASSK\'s compound.  \"And besides,\" the major said, \"if ASSK 
wants to see you, she will have to make an official request.\" 
 The uncles suggested that the army major consult with ASSK 
directly on her wishes and the hapless officer demurred, 
responding \"I don\'t have permission myself to enter the 
compound.\" 
 
6. (C) U Nyunt Wei said the uncles exchanged friendly banter 
for about an hour with their regime interlocutors.  The 
senior regime officer on the scene claimed that the SPDC was 
undertaking efforts to \"improve the political situation\" and 
cited as an example the recent transfer from prison to house 
arrest of NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo (ref B).  In what the 
uncles interpreted as a threat to keep quiet, the major 
exhorted the NLD CEC not to create \"untoward incidents which 
will inevitably cause problems and force the SPDC to blame 
the NLD leadership.\"  Following what U Nyunt Wei described as 
a \"light standoff,\" MI agents escorted the uncles home in 
government vehicles. 
 
A Train to Nowhere 
------------------ 
 
7. (C) U Nyunt Wei took advantage of our meeting to reiterate 
the CEC\'s position on the regime\'s road map for democracy. 
\"We will not take a public stand,\" he said, \"unless all nine 
members of our Central Committee can meet together freely to 
discuss our views.\"  We inquired about the CEC\'s ability to 
get input from ASSK on the road map and other party issues 
while she is under house arrest.  U Nyunt Wei smiled and 
said, \"We have no official communications with her,\" 
intimating that the uncles make use of a back channel to 
communicate with ASSK. 
 
8. (C) With regard to the December Thai-hosted meeting on 
Burma, U Nyunt Wei said that the CEC had written to all of 
the Bangkok participants to exchange views.  To date, the 
uncles have not heard a single word back from China, India, 
or any of the ASEAN participants.  U Nyunt Wei said he was 
particularly galled at not hearing from the Indians, the 
\"so-called largest democracy in the world.\"  He added, 
however, that the CEC greatly appreciates the ongoing support 
and contact from the U.S. and the U.K. missions.  \"Without 
you, we have no one,\" he said. 
 
9. (C) However, Ambassadors from Australia, Italy, France, 
and Germany and the Japanese political counselor have all 
responded to the NLD appeal and met with the released CEC 
members in recent weeks.  U Nyunt Wei said that while the NLD 
leaders appreciated the opportunity to hear first-hand about 
the Bangkok meeting, the diplomats all had a similar message 
which warned the NLD that \"the train is leaving, and you need 
to get on board (with the road map process).\"  The NLD 
leaders responded, \"we\'ve been on that train and it\'s not 
going anywhere worthwhile.\" 
 
10. (C) U Nyunt Wei said that it was impossible to envision 
participating in a National Convention without the release of 
ASSK and other NLD leaders and the re-opening of NLD offices. 
 He concluded that it would be \"foolish\" for the NLD to 
repeat the failed experience of the 1993 Convention which was 
convened under similar circumstances and failed miserably. 
\"We got off that train for a good reason,\" he said. 
 
Comment:  Taking Charge 
----------------------- 
 
11. (C) The released NLD CEC members are clearly pushing the 
envelope with the SPDC.  While they may have some limited 
contact with ASSK, we suspect the main motivating factor in 
pursuing more visible tactics may be to appease the youth 
wing of the NLD, which by all accounts is frustrated with the 
stalemate and growing restless.  Also, ASSK has expressed in 
the past her own desire to see the CEC take a more proactive 
role in leading the party when she is incarcerated or 
otherwise isolated by the SPDC.  The regime has responded to 
the feisty uncles by cutting the phone lines of several CEC 
members and restricting the others to outgoing calls only 
(which prohibits the uncles from receiving inquiries from 
international journalists).  However, overall SPDC 
intimidation since their late 2003 release has been, by 
regime standards, fairly limited.  End Comment.

1.  (C) SUMMARY: The Department\'s Burma Desk Officer joined 
Poloff and PolFSN on an early February three-day 500-mile 
road trip from Rangoon to Mon and Karen States, which lie on 
Burma\'s southeastern border with Thailand.  NLD members we 
met in Mon and Karen States seemed fairly well organized and 
mentally in the game.  Representatives remained in contact 
with national leaders, each other and local members, even 
with their offices shuttered.  All seemed ready, and even 
eager, for continued pursuit of democracy as soon as they are 
given the opportunity to express their views freely and to 
organize openly. END SUMMARY. 
 
MON STATE NLD: STILL IN THE WILDERNESS 
 
2.  (C) Moulmein NLD MP-elect and Mon State NLD Vice Chair 
Naing Thaung Nyo recounted that the NLD won 16 out of 20 
seats in the state in 1990.  Of those 16 MPs, five have 
resigned and one has gone into exile to join the NLD-LA. 
Their NLD offices were closed after May 30 and members are 
unable to move around freely due to tight security controls. 
Like the NLD Central Executive Committee (CEC) in Rangoon, 
they are trying to mobilize in their own way and are using 
the home of the provincial Chairman as their party office. 
The Mon State NLD sent representatives to meet with the five 
free NLD CEC leaders a month after their release from house 
arrest.  They remain in communication with their colleagues 
in Rangoon and follow their directives. 
 
ANY KNU CEASE-FIRE IMPACT? 
 
3.  (C) The Vice Chairman stated that the SPDC-KNU cease-fire 
will have \"no effect\" on the NLD.  There is no political gain 
for the SPDC because their goals in the cease-fire are too 
divergent from the KNU\'s.  He then tempered his remarks, 
saying the participation of the KNU in a national convention 
might lead to pressure on the NLD to join. 
 
4.  (C) In the Vice Chairman\'s opinion, the SPDC is now 
unable to maneuver politically due to economic and social 
constraints, and is using the road map as the way to escape 
from this situation.  Asked if the NLD in Mon State has 
discussed the PM\'s road map, the Vice Chairman replied, 
officially \"there is no discussion of the road map within the 
Mon State NLD membership, the topic is not under 
consideration.\"  He then offered that \"the heart of the road 
map is undemocratic, so it can\'t work for the ethnics nor for 
the NLD.\"  He defined this thought further by saying the road 
map would be acceptable and would be fine for a political 
transition, except for the part about the military taking the 
leadership role in Burmese politics. 
 
NO NLD POLITICAL PRISONERS? 
 
5.  (C) No NLD members in Mon State were arrested after the 
May 30 Depeyin attack.  Six local NLD youth arrested in 1997 
were recently released, leaving about 40 other non-NLD 
political prisoners in the Moulmein prison.  Each month, the 
Mon State NLD Humanitarian Assistance Committees visits them 
to provide food and clothing. 
 
KAREN STATE NLD HOLDING STEADY 
 
6.  (C) Emboffs also visited Daw Nant Khin Htwe Myint, Vice 
Chairman of the Karen State NLD and MP-elect from Pa-an 
Township, capital of Karen State.  She reported that there 
were 2,000 NLD members in Pa-an, and another 5,000 in the 
seven Townships around Karen State, with many more inactive 
or \"sleeping\" members.  She stated that May 30 had not 
brought a change in the political, economic, or social 
situation in Karen State.  Prior to May 30, freedoms had been 
thoroughly oppressed, and there hadn\'t been an open NLD 
office.  Pa-an had been scheduled for a visit by ASSK to 
reopen the NLD office there.  The MP-elect uses her house as 
the NLD gathering point in Pa-an.  She has already met with 
the NLD CEC in Rangoon to discuss the road map and finds it 
and the National Convention unacceptable. 
 
KNU CEASE-FIRE?: TOO EARLY TO TELL 
 
7.  (C) Regarding the impact of the KNU cease-fire, Daw Nant 
Khin Htwe Myint said \"it is too early to say.\"  The KNU 
hadn\'t discussed the cease-fire with the NLD, but the 
Vice-Chair noted that the mentality and objectives of the KNU 
and NLD are the same, and pointed out that ASSK had always 
publicly supported ethnic group declarations or statements. 
The MP-elects\'s brother, Saw Soe Htut, is a KNU CEC member. 
 
8.  (C) Regarding political prisoners, in Karen State, there 
are no NLD members currently in detention.  However, there 
are still 20 students in jail convicted under law 17(I) for 
alleged connection with illegal organizations -- particularly 
the KNU. 
 
NLD LIFE IN A SMALL TOWN 
 
9.  (C) We visited a small NLD office in Thaton Township, 
halfway between Rangoon and Moulmein.  Daw San Myint, the 
Vice Chair, told us that there were 19 NLD organizers and 
3,000-4,000 NLD members in the township.  However, the 
organization and recruiting were static for the time being. 
The last party meeting was held January 23 at her house, the 
regular office having been shuttered -- though the local NLD 
still pays the 9,000 kyat ($10 USD) monthly rent for the 
office space.  The local representatives of the military 
junta periodically visit her house to check on recent NLD 
activity. 
 
REGIME SECURITY GOONS INTERFERE 
 
10.  (C) The security controls on the NLD were very evident 
during our visit, including the Office of the Chief of 
Military Intelligence (OCMI) visiting our hotel twice in 
Moulmein demanding the staff question us on our purpose for 
the visit.  Our first attempt to visit the NLD Chairman in 
Moulmein was spoiled after OCMI learned of our presence in 
the city and subsequently placed security at the entrance of 
the Chairman\'s house.  He was only able to meet with us by 
setting up an early morning meeting in a restaurant the next 
day.  In Pa-an, the Vice-Chairman told us that OCMI would 
visit her house following our visit to question her on the 
reason we had come. 
 
11.  (C) COMMENT: Considering the post-May 30 pressure the 
NLD has been under, the NLD members appeared to be very 
upbeat and ready for the next opportunity to bring their 
fight into the open.  The heavy presence of OCMI could be 
felt in Moulmein, but surprisingly, Pa\'an felt a little less 
restricted.  In the small town of Thaton, the only security 
pressure reportedly came from the chatty local Peace and 
Development Council Chairman, which could explain why Thaton 
NLD members can be so vocal in their desire for change.  END 
COMMENT.

1.  (C) SUMMARY: Emboff and FSN met Feb 14 with a high-level 
New Mon State Party (NMSP) delegation visiting Rangoon to 
meet with the PM and to attend the 57th Union Day activities 
-- including the State Banquet hosted by Than Shwe.  The 
NMSP, one of the major cease-fire groups, discussed a wide 
array of issues in Mon State, including religious tolerance, 
how GOB officials are involved in trafficking in persons, a 
festering SPDC land confiscation issue, the KNU cease-fire 
effect on the road map, Mon refugee concerns, Burmese Army 
child soldiers, and DKBA drug running.  END SUMMARY. 
 
RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE, TO A POINT 
 
2.  (C) Our Mon interlocutors told us there are numerous 
Muslim communities in Mon State, especially in the 
NMSP-controlled areas between Moulmein and Kyaikmayaw 
Townships.  The October and November Buddhist-Muslim riots in 
central Burma didn\'t affect Mon State even though the 
majority of the Mon State population is Mon Buddhist.  The 
NMSP leaders said this tolerance is due to the NMSP policy of 
\"harmonious settlement\" of communities and because the NMSP 
\"allows the Muslims to practice freely as long as they don\'t 
create any problems.\" 
 
OFFICIAL INVOLVEMENT IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
 
3.  (C) Human trafficking is rampant in Mon State, a main 
route for migrants and traffickers heading to Thailand, 
Singapore, and Malaysia through southeast Burma.  Because of 
the depressed local economy, the NMSP allows males to travel 
from their communities across the borders.  For Mon women, 
the NMSP and Mon community leaders, while trying to educate 
their women on the dangers of migration, approach the problem 
by simply banning Mon women from traveling.  But brokers and 
traffickers have organized a systematic process with the help 
of field-level officials from GOB immigration, police, the 
Burmese Army (BA), and the Office of the Chief of Military 
Intelligence (OCMI), and they are still taking an untold 
number across.  According to the NMSP, these lower-level 
officials \"coordinate trafficking activities with the Thai 
and Malay police.\"  The total number of trafficking victims 
is unknown, but the NMSP believes it is a \"large number.\" 
(Embassy Comment: The NMSP leaders didn\'t specify if these 
were cases of trafficking or migrant smuggling.)

4.  (C) According to the NMSP leaders, in July 2003, the BA 
confiscated land to expand its Yay Township brigade by ten 
battalions, dispossessing families from about 3,000 acres of 
land.  The NMSP leadership raised the matter with then 
Secretary-1 (now PM) Khin Nyunt in August 2003 and requested 
 
SIPDIS 
compensation for the land.  The General promised the GOB 
would compensate land owners, but after several days the SPDC 
said it would only compensate for plants left behind at a 
rate of 300 kyat (.31 cents) for fruit bearing trees, and 150 
kyat (.15 cents) for trees without fruit.  Owners would get 
no compensatino for land without plants as the land was 
declared \"State Owned Property.\"  NMSP has not accepted this 
answer, and has sought ICRC assistance to settle the matter. 
 
 
KNU CEASE-FIRE: FOR THE ROAD MAP 
 
5.  (C) NMSP expects the SPDC and KNU will eventually reach a 
political settlement since the SPDC is eager to settle all 
its ethnic problems as soon as possible to execute the road 
map.  NMSP also commented that two 70-truck convoys of three 
BA battalions seen by Emboffs in Mon State in early February 
could be BA preparations for new offensive operations. 
(Comment: However, Karen contacts told us during a a Feb 12 
Union Day Dinner with the UNA that these large BA convoys 
could be reinforcements for the demarcation process and to 
provide security for an imminent Mae Sot-to-Myawaddy road 
project.) 
MON IDP/REFUGEES: DEFORESTATION WHILE SITTING TIGHT 
 
6  (C) According to the NMSP leadership, there are three Mon 
\"refugee\" camps just on the Burma side of the Thai-Burma 
border, Kolokhani, Yay-Chaung Phya, and Kin-Chung Phay, with 
1,500 families totaling 7,000 internally displaced persons. 
Before the 1996 SPDC-NMSP cease-fire, these IDPs were forced 
to evacuate their native villages and resettle in the camps 
on the border.  The Burma Border Coalition (BBC) provides 
rice and MSF-Holland provides health care to the IDPs. 
However, the NMSP is increasingly concerned that three months 
ago, BBC reduced assistance to the Mon IDPs and that they are 
facing food and medicine problems.  The Mon IDPs have begun 
clearing the forests in the surrounding area to prepare for 
planting the rice crops they will now need. 
 
7.  (C) According to the NMSP leaders, currently these IDPs 
have little intention of returning to their original villages 
because of better job opportunities in Thailand.  The IDPs 
are also concerned about the fragility of the SPDC-NMSP 
cease-fire, which they feel could be violated by the SPDC at 
anytime.  Several concerns have to be answered before IDPs 
return to their home villages: 1) because of their long stay 
along the border they will feel alien if resettled back 
inside the region; 2) educational concerns for the children; 
3) health care concerns; 4) work concerns.  Asked if the 
SPDC-NMSP cease-fire is fragile, the NMSP replied \"it is only 
a gentlemen\'s agreement.\" 
 
JUST SAY \"NO!\" TO THE DRUG-RUNNING DKBA 
 
8.  (C) The NMSP Vice Chairman told Poloff that in early 
January the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), a pro-SPDC 
KNU splinter group, tried to smuggle heroin and 
methamphetemines to Thailand though NMSP territory near Three 
Pagoda Pass.  An NMSP patrol stopped and challenged the DKBA 
convoy, resulting in a short fire-fight.  The DKBA retreated, 
leaving behind one DKBA killed, a small bag of heroin, and a 
handful of methamphetemines.  The NMSP, negotiating through 
OCMI intermediaries, had to compensate the family of the dead 
DKBA soldier with 1 million kayt (about $860) to resolve the 
issue with the DKBA.  The NMSP informed the DKBA they won\'t 
allow any drug trafficking through their area. 
 
ANY CHILD SOLDERS? 
 
9.  (C) According to the NMSP, there are \"a lot of 15 and 16 
year old child soldiers in the DKBA.\" As for the BA, the NMSP 
leaders estimated there are about 30 soldiers per BA 
battalion under 18 years of age, some 15 and 16.  When 
pressed on the number actually observed, our NMSP 
interlocutors said they hadn\'t seen many recently, adding 
their number \"was just a guess.\"  However, they offered that 
in the BA, underage soldiers are kept in support jobs back in 
headquarters compounds, or are posted to frontier areas where 
foreigners won\'t see them.  Young people don\'t want to join 
the BA, but USDA and the Fire Brigades force them to join the 
army.  (Comment: Their \"30 child-soldiers per battalion\" 
figure could be an figure based on NMSP experience fighting 
the BA in the mid 1990s when BA recruiting efforts would have 
been more frantic and child recruiting more common.  However, 
if still current, the number would equate roughly to 6,450 
child soldiers in the BA\'s estimated 215 battalions) 
 
10.  (C) COMMENT: The Mon leaders were very engaging and 
talkative, which makes for a very refreshing meeting in this 
police state.  The land confiscation issue has remained a 
major bone of contention between the NMSP and the SPDC, and 
if the SPDC continues to ignore Mon requests for 
compensation, the eight-year-old \"gentlemen\'s agreement\" 
cease-fire may possibly be undermined.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: AMERICAN CENTER SPEAKER PROMOTES DIALOGUE ON 
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Embassy Rangoon\'s Public Affairs Section 
hosted Fulbright Scholar Jeffrey Kamakahi for programs on 
diversity, inequality, and social change with Burma\'s many 
ethnic, racial, and religious groups.  Though the target 
audiences greatly appreciated his visit, they also expressed 
their continued distrust of the ruling SPDC (particularly 
with regard to the seven point \"road map to democracy\") and 
the Burman/Buddhist majority.  Despite common calls for NLD- 
SPDC-ethnic group dialogue and demands for federalism, the 
ethnic groups\' internal divisions prevent a unified approach 
to the SPDC.  The Muslim community, marginalized and 
oppressed by the SPDC and having no natural minority ethnic 
affiliation, feels particularly powerless.  End Summary. 
 
Diversity and the Need to Look to the Future 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) From February 8-14, Professor Jeffrey Kamakahi, a 
professor of sociology from St. John\'s University in 
Minnesota, and current Fulbright Scholar at Sendai 
University in Japan, visited Burma (with Regional Fulbright 
funding support) to give presentations on diversity, 
inequality, and social change to a variety of ethnic, 
racial, and religious groups.  As a reflection of the value 
Americans place in a diverse society, the program\'s 
objective was to help our target audiences view diversity 
positively and find mechanisms to constructively address 
inequality. 
 
3.  (U) The programs were directed at both cross-ethnic 
political groups, such as the United Nationalities Alliance 
(UNA) and the Ethnic Nationality Mediators\' Fellowship 
(ENMF), and mono-ethnic organizations, such as the Karen 
Development Committee (KDC) and the Shan Language and 
Literacy Association.  In addition, the Professor met with 
religious-based groups and individuals, such as the faculty 
and students of the Myanmar Institute of Theology, the 
recently retired Catholic archbishop of Rangoon, an 
interfaith group organized by the Mandalay YMCA, and Muslim 
Community religious and social leaders, as well as a student 
group from a prominent Islamic Center. 
 
4.  (U) In his presentations, Professor Kamakahi stressed 
the importance of looking to the future to establish a sense 
of \"identity\" as a basis for increasing solidarity within a 
society, rather than clinging solely to traditional ideas of 
race and ethnicity that often divide communities.  He 
contended that ethnic and religious majorities are not as 
monolithic as they seem and can often find common cause with 
minority groups.  He also emphasized, however, that the 
majority often gets its way and that those with power try to 
keep it. 
 
\"Second-class Citizens\" Mistrust Government But Lack Unity 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) All the groups with whom Professor Kamakahi met 
are attempting to address ethnic/religious identity issues 
both in the general sense of coexisting equitably and 
peacefully with a Burman-Buddhist majority, and in the 
specific sense of determining how to defend their 
ethnic/religious interests in the context of the SPDC\'s 
seven-point road map to democracy.  The road map includes 
convening a national constitutional convention and holding a 
referendum on the new constitution to be followed by 
parliamentary elections to form a new government.  The SPDC 
has been conducting bilateral negotiations with a number of 
ethnic groups to participate in the constitutional 
convention.  In that context, all groups expressed gratitude 
to Professor Kamakahi for provoking discussion and providing 
intellectual tools to address diversity issues. 
 
6.  (SBU) Professor Kamakahi\'s program also revealed a 
unanimity among groups that ethnic and religious minorities 
are treated as \"second class citizens\" even in the areas in 
which they constitute a majority and that the SPDC (with its 
policies of \"divide and rule\" and \"Burmanization\") could not 
be trusted.  Most also called for a \"tripartite\" dialogue 
among the SPDC, NLD, and the ethnic groups. 
 
7.  (SBU) In many instances, the mistrust of the SPDC 
extended to the Burman/Buddhist majority as well.  A UNA 
participant explained: \"I hate Burman authority, not Burman 
people,\" though he added that the SPDC was a \"master race\" 
government.  A Shan interlocutor commented that while he had 
no problem trusting other ethnic groups, he could not trust 
ethnic Burmans.  Similar sentiment was expressed in meetings 
with other ethnic and religious groups.  In fact, none of 
the ethnic groups have built significant alliances with the 
members of the Burman-Buddhist majority.  (Ironically, in 
Mandalay, ethnic Burman Buddhists who expressed sympathy for 
the plight of non-Buddhists, had nothing but mistrust for 
the burgeoning Chinese community there.) 
 
8.  (SBU) Ethnic groups\' common consensus disintegrates over 
a number of issues, including what actions should be taken 
in light of the SPDC road map.  As much as the ENMF (which 
is working with ethnic cease-fire groups) supports the 
national constitutional convention envisioned by the SPDC 
(under certain conditions), the UNA opposes it, and both 
believe they represent the best interests of their own 
ethnic groups.  Perhaps revealing his own ideas on 
diversity, one UNA representative likened an SPDC invitation 
to the constitutional convention to \"inviting a Muslim to 
eat pork.\"  The ENMF\'s more positive posture towards the 
road map has drawn criticism for its leader, Reverend Saboi 
Jum.  Retired Catholic Bishop Gabriel, himself a Karen, 
accused Saboi Jum of being an opportunist, personally 
profiting financially from cease-fire negotiations. 
 
9.  (SBU) Another factor contributing to ethnic disunity was 
the perception of each group\'s importance vis--vis the 
other groups.  For example, because of the KNU\'s support of 
Burmese exile groups on the Thai border and the Karen 
minority\'s wide geographic distribution within Burma, the 
Karen community believes it is a leader among ethnic groups. 
Commenting about participation in the national convention, a 
Karen business leader said: \"If we go in, the rest (of the 
ethnic groups) will follow.\"  Similarly, the Shan community 
still feels an acute historical grievance: they believe that 
the Union of Burma only exists because of the Shan 
nationality\'s agreement to join in 1948. 
 
 
Muslims Feel Powerless and Unrepresented 
----------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) Having emphasized their Burman identity in the 
past, the Muslim community feels particularly helpless in 
the face of SPDC oppression.  For example, SPDC authorities 
insist on identifying Muslims as \"mixed race,\" a negative 
attribute in the SPDC\'s \"pure Burman\" race construct. 
Muslim leaders have supported the NLD in the past, but they 
do not feel the NLD\'s support in return.  And because they 
have no natural ethnic affiliation (as some of the Christian 
denominations do), Muslim interests are not even voiced (let 
alone represented) in the current political environment. 
The Muslims reserved particular disappointment for the 
Indian, Malaysian, and Indonesian governments for their 
indifference to the plight of Burmese Muslims. 
 
11.  (SBU) In that context, the Muslim leaders appreciated 
Professor Kamakahi\'s message of seeking commonality with 
other groups in order to forge a future-oriented identity. 
Commenting on the Professor\'s lecture to a student group 
from a prominent local Islamic Center (the first such 
Embassy event with this group), a Muslim leader said: 
\"You\'ve said the right thing.\" 
 
12.  (SBU) Comment:  Professor Kamakahi commented that most 
of the groups seemed to be at the \"pluralism\" phase of 
diversity, with each group defining itself by its past and 
negotiating with other groups for its own parochial 
interests.  However, given the enthusiasm that greeted this 
program, perhaps ethnic and religious groups will begin to 
explore points of commonality among groups in Burmese 
society (including the Burman/Buddhist majority) that will 
help address constructively their historical grievances and 
current political aspirations. End comment.  MARTINEZ

1. (C) Summary: As is its custom, the GOB released with no 
warning news of three important steps toward the 
implementation of its anti-money laundering law.  It 
announced the setting of threshold amounts for banking and 
real estate transactions, and the naming of members to its 
nascent Financial Investigation Unit.  However, it refused to 
make public any specifics.  Though these are key moves in 
principle, the lack of openness and the GOB\'s dire lack of 
capacity to fight financial crime lead us to advise caution 
in giving Burma\'s money laundering regime a clean bill of 
health.  End summary. 
 
Oh, By the Way, We Reformed 
 
2. (C) With no prior warning, the Burmese Minister for Home 
Affairs on February 19 sent a letter to the Financial Action 
Task Force (FATF) secretariat informing the body of three 
significant anti-money laundering directives approved by the 
GOB cabinet on January 8.  First, the letter indicated the 
Minister, as chairman of the new money laundering Central 
Control Board (CCB), had set a \"specific,\" though 
unmentioned, threshold amount for reporting requirements. 
Second, the CCB had set a \"specific,\" though again 
unmentioned, threshold amounts for real estate transactions. 
Finally, the CCB formally named representatives to the 
Financial Investigation Unit (FIU). 
 
3. (C) The three January directives close several gaps that 
remained even after the GOB in December 2003 issued 
long-awaited regulations to promulgate its June 2002 Control 
of Money Laundering Law (CMLL; see ref C).  It was, in part, 
the lack of these regulations that led FATF last November to 
officially urge its member countries to impose 
countermeasures against Burma.  The other half of FATF\'s 
concern, the lack of a mutual legal assistance framework law, 
has not yet been addressed. 
 
Thresholds Set, But We\'re Not Telling 
 
4. (C) According to a close Embassy source, and member of the 
FIU, the specific contents of the three directives remain 
highly classified.  He said the CCB reported the threshold 
amounts only to the banks, the FIU, and Central Bank of 
Myanmar.  Likewise for the real estate transaction threshold. 
 We learned from other sources in the GOB and at private 
banks, though, that the threshold amount for banks was set at 
100 million kyat (roughly US$120,000).  However, private 
bankers told us, they had yet to receive any written 
notification on this new requirement.  We have not yet been 
able to verify the threshold amount set for real estate 
transactions. 
 
The FIU: Outfitted But Not Ready for Battle 
 
5. (C) The FIU membership announcement is also classified, 
however, our FIU contact was willing to tell us who was on 
the list.  The director of the FIU will be a police Colonel 
from the Myanmar Police Force\'s Central Committee for Drug 
Abuse Control (CCDAC).  He will have two deputies, one from 
the Police Force\'s Central Investigation Division (CID) and 
one from the Ministry of Home Affairs\' Bureau of Special 
Investigation (BSI).  (Note: The Myanmar Police Force is also 
under the aegis of the Home Affairs Ministry.) 
 
6. (C) The rest of the committee is made up of a Lt. Colonel 
from CCDAC, and deputy director-level officials from BSI, the 
Central Bank, the Land Record Department, the Internal 
Revenue Department, the Customs Department, and the Auditor 
General\'s office.  There will also be three administrative 
staff from the CCDAC, the Police Force, and the BSI.  The 
investigative staff will be made up of various officers from 
the BSI, CID, CCDAC, and Customs. 
 
7. (C) In the context of asking for more international 
capacity building, our contact admitted that there was a real 
dearth of well-trained financial investigators in the Burmese 
law enforcement community.  This, he said, would be the 
primary barrier to enforcement of the money laundering 
statute.  He told us that since the FIU\'s formation in 
mid-January, there had not been any reports from banks and no 
investigations begun by the FIU.  This is not a good sign. 
Although private banks have been in shambles since a banking 
crisis struck in February 2003, and thus will not be engaging 
in major transactions (see ref B), the FIU\'s investigations 
were supposed to be retroactive to the passage of the CMLL in 
June 2002, when the private banks were at the peak of their 
freewheeling ways. 
 
Comment: Some Good, But No Credibility 
8. (C) The appointment of solidly professional, vice 
political, officials to the FIU is a reassuring step. 
Likewise, we concur that the lack international training on 
fighting money laundering and terrorist financing will be a 
large obstacle to the successful enforcement of Burma\'s now 
\"complete\" money laundering regime.  However, we are dismayed 
that once again the senior SPDC leadership is clearly having 
a hard time committing fully to a policy step.  This is too 
bad, as it will keep Burma from getting whatever credit is 
due from making important reforms, at least on paper.  It 
also makes us suspicious of the SPDC\'s motives, and leaves us 
to advise caution until there is evidence of real action 
taken.  The result of the ongoing investigation into two of 
Burma\'s most notorious private banks, due in early March, 
will be the first test of the SPDC\'s earnestness to combat 
money laundering.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA: WFP PLANS EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE TO 
EX-POPPY FARMERS 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The World Food Programme (WFP) plans to 
initiate on March 1 a one-year program to assist former poppy 
farmers suffering from food insecurity.  The program will 
cost about $4 million and target about 180,000 beneficiaries 
in the ethnic Kokang and Wa border areas through 
food-for-work activities, school feeding, and vulnerable 
group feeding.  In addition to consulting with the U.S. 
Embassy, the WFP Country Director recently met with leaders 
of the pro-democracy opposition to discuss the new program. 
The initiative is similar to existing WFP food assistance in 
Burma and also appears to be closely coordinated with UNODC 
counter-drug initiatives in the Wa and Kokang regions.  We 
have faxed the project proposal to EAP/BCLTV.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) According to the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) 
Burma Country Director Bhim Udas, WFP plans to target about 
180,000 people in the Kokang and Wa regions with a one-year 
emergency food program to assist former poppy farmers and 
their families who are suffering from severe food insecurity. 
 In response to an urgent request from the Kokang Authority 
and the GOB, WFP already assisted about 50,000 poor ex-poppy 
farmers in the Kokang area during the last three months of 
2003. 
 
3. (SBU) The \"Emergency Food Assistance to Ex-Poppy Farmers\" 
is planned for the period March 1, 2004 through February 28, 
2005 and would include almost 10,000 metric tons of food at a 
total cost to WFP of just over $4 million.  A March 2003 
joint assessment of humanitarian needs, conducted by the 
UNODC and JICA (Japanese aid agency), determined that farmers 
in the heart of Burma\'s poppy regions on average now only 
grow enough rice to live on for about half a year.  U.N. 
agencies expect food insecurity to increase as pressures 
mount on local Wa authorities to cease poppy cultivation 
entirely by 2005.  Currently, the average poppy farmer earns 
about $160 cash per year from the sale of opium, which 
represents roughly 70 percent of the farmer\'s total cash 
income. 
 
4. (SBU) Based on the findings of a recent WFP rapid needs 
assessment, WFP will target 90,000 people in the Wa region, 
60,000 people in Kokang, and 30,000 in Kutkai, Muse, and 
other areas in Shan State.  WFP will assist beneficiaries 
through food-for-work activities (50,000 participants, 
reaching 165,000 beneficiaries), primary school feeding 
(45,000 children), and vulnerable group feeding (5,000 
elderly, disabled, and chronically sick people).  WFP 
currently has a field office in Laukai (Kokang) and to help 
implement the new program will open two additional field 
offices (Lashio and Pangsang).  WFP expects to implement the 
overall program through its existing partners, which include 
CARE, World Vision, and ADRA. 
 
5. (SBU) WFP is planning its emergency food program largely 
in response to UNODC\'s appeal for partners to help implement 
\"KOWI\" (Kokang and Wa initiative) to keep farmers poppy-free. 
 In the Wa region, WFP will tap into existing UNODC resources 
including office facilities and a comprehensive database.  In 
exchange, UNODC plans to establish a technical coordination 
unit (TCU) within existing WFP facilities in the Kokang 
region as a key first step in implementing its KOWI 
initiative. 
 
6. (SBU) Udas, the WFP Country Director, says that the WFP 
food program will be mostly independent of the Burmese 
regime.  However, \"NATALA,\" the GOB\'s intra-ministerial body 
that administers border area affairs, will facilitate WFP\'s 
program discussions with local authorities in Special Regions 
#1 and #2 (self-governed by former Kokang and Wa insurgents) 
and secure GOB permission for static and mobile 
communications equipment. 
 
7. (C) Comment: WFP\'s Country Director has submitted a 
proposal and budget to his Executive Director in Rome, where 
WFP is expected to make an appeal to donors for support.  In 
addition to his approach to us, Bhim Udas recently consulted 
with members of the NLD\'s Central Executive Committee on the 
emergency food assistance program.  (Note: We have not heard 
the results of his meeting with the pro-democracy opposition 
leaders.  End note.)  The new WFP program is in line with 
existing WFP food assistance in Burma\'s central dry zone, 
with repatriated refugees in Rahkine State along the 
Bangladesh border, and also appears to be closely coordinated 
with UNODC counter-drug initiatives in the Wa and Kokang 
regions.  End comment.

REF: 03 RANGOON 1314 
 
Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The SPDC has handed down prison sentences 
ranging from 7 to 17 years to six university activists who 
distributed a handful of leaflets criticizing the regime\'s 
\"road map for democracy.\"  This harsh treatment is business 
as usual for a regime that tolerates no dissent.  Meanwhile, 
Burma\'s neighbors continue to send special envoys and VIPs to 
Rangoon, but few are willing to address human rights issues. 
End summary. 
 
2. (C) The Burmese regime, at a secret trial inside Rangoon\'s 
infamous Insein prison, handed down on February 20 sentences 
ranging from 7 to 17 years to a group of six young political 
activists detained since September 2003 for distributing 
leaflets that criticized the SPDC\'s \"road map for democracy.\" 
 
 
3. (C) The six convicted activists were part of a larger 
group of university students originally detained o/a 
September 26 (reftel).  In addition to the students, 
authorities had also detained and later released U Win Naing, 
a former U.S. Embassy FSN and veteran political activist. 
Neither U Win Naing nor any of the sentenced activists are 
members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) or 
affiliated with registered political parties.  However, they 
are strong supporters of the pro-democracy movement and are 
frequently referred to as Burma\'s \"Third Force\" or \"Third 
Way\" of independent activists who join the NLD and the 
pro-democracy ethnic groups in opposition to the regime. 
 
4. (SBU) The students allegedly distributed a handful of 
leaflets in Rangoon Division last September, in which they 
called on the SPDC to honor the 1990 elections (that the NLD 
won decisively) and urged Burmese citizens not to support the 
regime\'s seven-point road map. 
 
5. (C) According to Embassy sources, all six of the student 
activists were convicted of undertaking prohibited political 
activities.  In addition, two students, Nandar Sit Aung and 
Kyaw Soe Moe, were convicted of \"illegal assembly\" for 
organizing the group.  Nandar Sit Aung, who received the 
longest sentence (17 years), was also convicted under 
immigration provisions of the law for having contact with 
Thailand-based exile groups. 
 
6. (C) Embassy sources identify the following student 
activists sentenced at Insein Prison on February 20: 
 
Nandar Sit Aung: Sentenced to 17 years. 
 
Zaw Lin Tun: Sentenced to 12 years. 
 
Kyaw Soe Moe: Sentenced to 12 years. 
 
Han Win Aung: Sentenced to 7 years. 
 
Lwin Ko Lat (aka Win Ko): Sentenced to 7 years. 
 
Kyaw Kyaw: Sentenced to 7 years. 
 
 
7. (C) Comment:  These harsh sentences are business as usual 
for a regime that tolerates no dissent.  Regretfully, among a 
long parade of regional leaders calling on the generals since 
the unveiling of the road map last August (the latest 
including the new Malaysian Prime Minister and the new 
Filipino Foreign Secretary; see forthcoming septel), scant 
few are willing to raise concerns over human rights abuses. 
End summary.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S PATRONAGE SYSTEM: THE DOG WAGS THE TAIL 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s military leadership thrives atop a 
flourishing patronage system that dates back hundreds of 
years.  The junta holds the key to huge success or crushing 
failure for those in business, the military, or civil 
service, but only rewards the most loyal and pliable.  Such 
an environment breeds fear, suspicion, and above all 
begrudging support for the status quo.  Unfortunately this 
climate makes it very difficult to expect that the generals 
will be challenged by disgruntled members of the military or 
business community.  After all, who will be the first to risk 
his position and family\'s future welfare by taking a stand? 
End summary. 
 
Patronage Makes the World Go \'Round 
 
2. (C) As the Burmese kings did for hundreds of years, the 
current ruling military State Peace and Development Council 
(SPDC) relies on a strict system of patronage to secure its 
power.  The regime controls nearly all the country\'s 
resources and means of production.  Loyalty and political 
\"correctness\" are rewarded by the junta well before 
competence, strategic vision, upright moral behavior, or even 
seniority.  Everyone knows very clearly that unquestioning 
obedience to the regime\'s leaders is the difference between a 
lucrative promotion or contract and sudden retirement or 
arrest.  This applies to across ethnic lines to people in the 
three key segments of Burmese society: military, business, 
and civil service (including the government-dominated worlds 
of arts and academia). 
 
3. (C) Ensuring the success of this patronage system, 
particularly in the business world, is what could be called 
the \"Rainy Day\" strategy.  The business climate and legal and 
regulatory frameworks for entrepreneurs here are so arbitrary 
and protean that most would-be businesspeople find it 
extremely difficult to carry out their affairs in full 
compliance with Burmese law.  Any business would soon go 
under if it abided scrupulously by often conflicting 
currency, tax, registration, trade, and other laws and 
regulations.  However, the regime and its minions, which use 
the Byzantine business climate for rent-seeking purposes, 
turn a blind eye to most transgressions unless they want to 
exert pressure.  At such time Military Intelligence will show 
up with a file full of misdeeds and threaten confiscation 
and/or deportation.  Thus most booming businesses, especially 
those of the cronies, become reliant on pleasing the 
government to keep the money flowing and avoid that midnight 
knock on the door. 
 
4. (C) From our contacts in the three key segments of 
society, it\'s clear that few in Burma, even those with 
significant wealth and power, are happy with the way the 
country is run.  However, despite some misconceptions to the 
contrary, we see no signs that this unhappiness will 
materialize into open opposition to the SPDC.  Who will be 
the first to risk his position and family\'s future welfare by 
taking a stand?  After all, the regime\'s leaders do not rely 
on their business cronies, senior civil servants, and senior 
military officers for support.  It is the other way around. 
 
Business: Offers They Can\'t Refuse 
 
5. (C) There are many illustrations of the patronage system 
at work in the business world.  The chairman of one of the 
country\'s largest construction companies told us he spent a 
great sum of money (he wouldn\'t say exactly how much) to 
upgrade the Rangoon-Mandalay highway under what he thought 
was a build, operate, transfer (BOT) arrangement with the 
government.  When the renovations were complete he was 
summarily dismissed by the senior SPDC leadership, his BOT 
\"contract\" ignored.  Despite this outrage, he could not 
complain or break with the SPDC because there is no other 
source for preferential future access to prime deals for his 
construction and other businesses. 
 
6. (C) Another example is the case of Senior General Than 
Shwe\'s current golden boy, U Tay Za.  Tay Za, who despite his 
lack of business knowledge (he is a military academy drop-out 
who pimped for various GOB elite before marrying into a 
venerable Burmese business family), runs a large conglomerate 
active in Burma and Singapore and has been given essentially 
the monopoly on lucrative private timber exporting, brokerage 
services for the GOB\'s weapons purchases, and other money 
makers.  In exchange, though, \"Godfather\" Than Shwe will ask 
Tay Za from time to time to personally fund special services 
such as medical trips to Singapore for the generals and their 
families and building and stocking a glitzy \"prestige 
project\" shopping mall in downtown Rangoon -- selling luxury 
products at prices very few in the country can afford.  In 
addition, there are rampant rumors that Than Shwe has pushed 
Tay Za to the altar with the Senior General\'s ugly duckling 
eldest daughter, with whom the business mogul has carried out 
a poorly concealed affair.  No matter that the favorite son 
is still married to his first wife. 
 
The Military: Kiss Up, Kick Down 
 
7. (C) There are also examples of the patronage system at 
work in the military ranks.  The highest profile is the story 
of current Prime Minister, and chief of intelligence, General 
Khin Nyunt.  The General made his way up the ranks ahead of 
more senior, more battle-hardened, and perhaps more competent 
officers because of his reliable service as, quite literally, 
\"umbrella boy\" to the longtime dictator of Burma General Ne 
Win (who ruled from 1962-88). 
 
8. (C) As a matter of policy, the SPDC ensures its military 
officers are fat, if not happy.  Lower-ranking officers get 
free cars, a tremendously valuable commodity, and extra 
gasoline to sell on the black market.  After attaining the 
rank of Lieutenant Colonel, an officer gets his first taste 
of the really good life: a plot of land in Rangoon, access to 
free building materials, and low interest government loans to 
build a house.  Once completed, the new house can be rented 
out and loan payments safely ignored. 
 
9. (C) Access to these money-making positions are limited, 
though.  Former military officers told us that promotions to 
the ranks and billets with access to the best graft and 
thievery opportunities are reserved for the most loyal 
subjects.  Soldiers who slog through the lower ranks, often 
acting as no better than laborers or servants to senior 
officers, understand quickly that toeing the line is the only 
way to get a taste of the pie.  Like in the business world, 
the senior leaders prefer to promote those to top military 
and ministerial jobs (almost always held by senior military 
officers) who have skeletons in the closet, which can be used 
at an opportune time to ensure good behavior. 
 
You Better Watch Out 
 
10. (C) The system works because the SPDC leadership means 
business.  No one, no matter how big, is safe if he 
embarrasses the leadership or, worse, threatens it.  The most 
notable case is the arrest and sentencing to death in 2002 of 
the son-in-law and grandsons of General Ne Win.  With their 
patron di tutti patrons on his death bed, the Ne Win 
relatives were swept up without hesitation by the SPDC for 
allegedly plotting a coup. 
 
11. (C) In another very recent example, the previously 
untouchable mayor of Rangoon U Ko Lay was fired and may be 
facing prosecution (septel).  The exact reason is not clear, 
but a well-placed business source told us it was because of 
egregious graft and corruption that proved embarrassing to 
the senior leaders.  The Mayor was notorious in the business 
community for his arrogance and for constantly requiring 
\"gifts,\" even if just a $5 plastic clock. 
 
Comment: Core is Rotten, But Solid 
 
12. (C) The nature of this patronage arrangement makes us 
doubt the conventional wisdom that splits within the military 
ranks will bring down the system.  Though few may be 
satisfied with the SPDC\'s policies or direction, they also 
know they are an integral part of the system and thus may not 
survive its dismantling.  The patronage system also militates 
against influencing the senior generals by leaning on their 
business cronies.  The cronies have little inherent value to 
the generals except their pliability and willingness to do 
the GOB\'s bidding -- in exchange for valuable recompense. 
Others could, and have been, found to replace anyone falling 
from favor.  End comment.

SUBJECT: FILIPINO ENVOY MAKES LOW-KEY VISIT TO BURMA 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Filipino Foreign Secretary Albert made her 
debut visit to Burma February 18-19 to get to know her 
Burmese counterpart and to resurrect a moribund 
Burma-Philippines Joint Commission.  Her public remarks were 
laudatory of regime road map efforts.  However, she did not 
meet with the Head of State, and the SPDC, which may view the 
Philippines as close to the U.S., gave the visit perfunctory 
treatment.  This was yet another missed opportunity by an 
ASEAN country to encourage the SPDC to make progress on a 
political dialogue.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Philippines Foreign Affairs Secretary Delia Domingo 
Albert, at the tail end of a swing through several mainland 
ASEAN countries, visited Rangoon February 18-19.  During her 
24-hour visit Secretary Albert met Prime Minister General 
Khin Nyunt and Foreign Minister U Win Aung.  Albert will 
return to Rangoon in April to participate in a meeting of the 
Burma-Philippines Joint Commission that will address 
cooperation in human resources development, trade, and 
agriculture. 
 
3. (C) The Philippines Ambassador to Burma, Phoebe Gomez, 
told the COM on Feb. 25 that a primary objective of the visit 
was for Albert to \"get comfortable\" with her Burmese 
counterpart, U Win Aung, prior to a March ASEAN retreat in 
Hanoi.  Gomez said she encouraged the visit as a way to kick 
start the Joint Commission, which was set up in 1997 during a 
visit of President Ramos but to date has not convened. 
Ambassador Gomez also allowed that she had pushed hard for 
this visit as she \"needed to do something\" in Burma, 
observing that other ASEAN countries, especially Thailand, 
were \"very active here.\" 
 
4. (C) Ambassador Gomez said that the GOP needs to establish 
\"one to one\" channels of communication with the Burmese, 
claiming that her government faced difficulties here because 
the Philippines is treated differently from the other ASEAN 
countries due to a close relationship with the United States. 
 The Ambassador said she did not press for a meeting between 
her Secretary and SPDC Chairman Than Shwe.  Gomez intimated 
to COM that she was afraid that a meeting might not be 
granted because of the perceived relationship with the U.S. 
or because the Burmese may be waiting for May Filipino 
presidential elections to see what the outcome could mean for 
the Philippines-Burma bilateral relationship. 
 
5. (U) According to the government-controlled \"Myanmar 
Times,\" in a February 19 interview Secretary Albert said that 
the Philippines supports the SPDC\'s road map for democracy. 
The newspaper quoted the Foreign Secretary as saying \"Both 
bilaterally and regionally we are good partners... in ASEAN 
we help each other to ensure that the vision of (a leader of 
a member state) could be implemented.\"  Ambassador Gomez said 
the remarks attributed to Albert were accurate, but the 
Filipino DCM told us separately that the quote was not 
exactly in line with the Philippines statement issued after 
the Bali ASEAN summit last October. 
 
Comment: What Ally? 
 
6. (C) We view this visit as another missed opportunity by a 
key ASEAN country to encourage the SPDC to make progress on a 
political dialogue with the democratic opposition.  Part of 
the problem may be Ambassador Gomez.  She has always been a 
little too close for comfort to the regime, hanging with the 
generals\' wives and at times appearing to be significantly 
out of line with Manila\'s Burma policy.  Gomez avoids the 
opposition groups like the plague and has never tried to meet 
with ASSK, even when other ASEAN ambassadors paid ASSK a 
courtesy call in May 2002.  She told us previously that she 
did not like late Foreign Secretary Ople\'s critical stance on 
Burma, which made life \"uncomfortable\" for her in Rangoon.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  U Ko Lay, who served as Rangoon\'s powerful 
mayor for fifteen years following the military regime\'s rise 
to power in 1988, has endured five months of disgrace 
stemming from an investigation into his corrupt practices and 
culminating in his forced retirement.  The murky demise of a 
former soldier-hero and powerful money maker for the regime, 
who once enjoyed a regular Sunday golf game with SPDC 
Chairman Than Shwe, is further evidence that no individual in 
Burma is untouchable when the generals wake up on the wrong 
side of the bed.  End Summary. 
 
Kingfish Ko Lay 
 
2. (C) Regime authorities have ousted U Ko Lay, Rangoon\'s 
powerful former mayor and a favorite \"son\" of the SPDC\'s 
senior generals, and placed him under investigation for 
corruption.  SPDC Senior General Than Shwe had removed U Ko 
Lay from the mayoral job in August 2003 and \"bumped him up\" 
to the Office of Prime Minister during preliminary 
investigations.  For five months, U Ko Lay served as a 
Minister without Portfolio under PM General Khin Nyunt until 
the ousted mayor\'s forced retirement in early February. 
 
3. (C) U Ko Lay was appointed Mayor of Rangoon in 1988, when 
the current regime came to power, and held the office for 
fifteen years.  He also served as Chairman of the Yangon City 
Development Committee (YCDC), the capital city\'s omnipotent 
municipal authority that has broad economic interests and 
controls expansive real estate holdings.  As Mayor, 
considered by many to be on par with the regime\'s regional 
military commanders, he reported directly to SPDC Chairman 
Senior General Than Shwe and by all accounts tapped YCDC 
assets to supply the SPDC generals with a regular source of 
supplemental income and services. 
 
All in the Family 
 
4. (C) According to many observers, U Ko Lay\'s tenure and 
power as Rangoon mayor was secured through close ties to the 
SPDC and, in particular, to Senior General Than Shwe, a 
regular Sunday golfing partner.  U Ko Lay earned his military 
credentials in the Burmese Army, rising to Colonel during 
several years of combat experience in the 1980s fighting the 
Communist Party of Burma in the Wa and Kokang regions on the 
border with China.  U Ko Lay also enjoyed close family 
connections to the junta, a helpful ingredient in the 
retention of power, through his daughter\'s marriage to the 
son of the late Lt. General Tin Oo, the SPDC\'s fourth ranking 
member until his death in a 2001 helicopter crash. 
 
One For You, Two For Me 
 
5. (C) According to GOB sources, as Mayor of Rangoon U Ko Lay 
amassed a personal real estate empire that included over 400 
apartments and numerous houses.  By all accounts, U Ko Lay 
gained considerable wealth from kickbacks and from YCDC 
income-generating projects in farming, livestock, and 
recreation facilities.  He reportedly demanded a cut of any 
action on his turf--including, for example, skimming 
membership fees at YCDC\'s public golf course--which angered 
the business community who found his petty corruption above 
and beyond the reasonable \"rent seeking\" norm. 
 
6. (C) The SPDC officially sacked U Ko Lay on February 4. 
According to the Rangoon rumor mill, he was then placed under 
arrest.  However, GOB sources claim that punitive actions 
were limited to a freeze of his assets, a physical search of 
his main Rangoon residence, and quiet retirement.  In 
addition, the GOB fired several dozen of U Ko Lay\'s long-time 
cronies at City Hall and elsewhere in the municipal 
government, placing several in detention and others under 
investigation. 
 
Comment: Here Today, Gone Tomorrow 
 
7. (C) It is unclear why U Ko Lay fell from the good graces 
of the SPDC generals.  Family connections to the SPDC may 
have been soured by his son-in-law\'s extramarital affair with 
one of Senior General Than Shwe\'s daughters.  A more likely 
explanation, however, is that greed got the best of U Ko Lay 
and he exceeded even the generous bounds of a regime built on 
corruption.  Sources say he also failed to adhere to the 
unspoken rules of the military leadership\'s informal 
patronage system and properly award his hierarchy (reftel). 
His demise is a further example that no individual in Burma 
is untouchable:  cross the generals, or fail to \"pay\" proper 
respect, and you will be punished.  End Comment.

Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  EU ambassadors resident in Rangoon and 
Bangkok met recently with the Burmese Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister.  The EU ambassadors assured COM that the 
meeting was not for the purpose of delivering any new EU 
policy message.  COM cautioned them that they needed to be 
extremely careful of letting the regime think it could expand 
the comfort zone that it has been steadily building with 
ASEAN, China, and India, into the EU, and urged them not to 
let the regime spin the meeting as a public show of EU 
support for the road map or as a follow-on to the \"Bangkok 
Process.\"  The EU reps said that unless there was some 
significant change in the political circumstances before 
April 2004 there was no initiative afoot to either soften or 
harden the EU Common Position.  It seems that the EU 
assemblage was careful not to send the signal that the 
regime\'s current \"democratization\" efforts are being viewed 
through the same rose-colored glasses worn by ASEAN, China 
and India.  The non-resident EU ambassadors seemed more 
frustrated with the slow progress and lack of time frame for 
the road map than those who are resident and used to \"SPDC 
time\", especially when it comes to any commitment to the 
release of ASSK.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On Monday, February 23, EU ambassadors resident in 
Rangoon and Bangkok met with Prime Minister Khin Nyunt and 
Foreign Minister Win Aung.  As the FonMin emphasized during 
the meeting, this was the first time that the PM had met with 
a group of ambassadors since taking over his new position on 
August 30 (FYI: in fact, for most, if not all, of the EU 
ambassadors at the meeting, even those resident in Rangoon, 
it was the first time they had met with Khin Nyunt in his 
guise as Secretary 1 or as Prime Minister, except for those 
few who had met him in a cursory protocol encounter when they 
presented their credentials.  End FYI.) 
 
3. (C) The COM met with the EU ambassadors just prior to 
their meeting with the PM.  The COM urged the assembled group 
to be very careful not to let the regime spin the meeting 
with the PM as a show of EU support for the road map or as a 
follow-on to the \"Bangkok Process.\"  The EU reps assured the 
COM that the meeting was not for the purpose of delivering 
any new EU policy message.  The COM also cautioned them to be 
extremely careful of letting the regime think it could expand 
the comfort zone that it has been steadily building with 
ASEAN, China, and India into the EU.  The EU reps also said 
that, unless there was some significant change in the 
political circumstances before April 2004, there was no 
initiative afoot to either soften or harden the EU Common 
Position. 
 
4. (C)  The EU reps said they were taking advantage of the 
presence of the assembled group to discuss the possibility of 
establishing an office of the European Commission for 
Humanitarian Assistance (ECHO) in Rangoon to oversee EU 
funded humanitarian projects that are already underway in 
Burma (FYI: It seems that many EU Ambassadors are unhappy 
with the lack of input they have on project 
funding/management as it is all managed, in a somewhat 
high-handed manner, by the head of the European Commission in 
Bangkok. End FYI).  When the opportunity to meet with the PM 
came up, of course they had to take advantage of it. 
 
5. (C) The hour long meeting was mainly taken up with a 55 
minute monologue by the PM on the cultural and political 
history of Burma.  However, as the PM arrived at \"current 
events\" he did say that \"everybody, and I mean everybody\" 
will be included in the National Convention.  However, the 
FonMin, in an unusually bold (for the FonMin) intervention, 
corrected the PM to say that \"everybody that is eligible to 
participate will participate.\"  The PM also said that the 
National Convention would probably be convened in fall 2004. 
 
6. (C)  As the PM brought the meeting to a close, the Dutch 
ambassador (the EU rep in Bangkok) was able to claim five 
minutes to make a few points.  He stated that the EU was 
waiting to see what results the road map brings before 
passing judgment.  He also expressed EU support for Special 
Envoy Razali and urged that the regime allow Razali to return 
and carry out his mandate soon.  He emphasized that the 
National Convention could only be viable with the 
participation of the democratic opposition and the ethnic 
groups. 
 
7.  (C) The Dutch ambassador also asked the PM to clarify a 
recent statement attributed to Thai Prime Minister Thaksin 
Shinawatra that Aung San Suu Kyi would be released from house 
arrest in October, 2004.  The PM did not give a definitive 
response, saying instead \"I am doing everything possible.\" 
EU reps commented that at least the PM did not try to 
continue the regime\'s farce that ASSK is not under house 
arrest. 
 
8. (C)  COM was able to corroborate much of the readout of 
the meeting later that evening in a conversation with the 
FonMin at the Brunei National Day Reception.  The FonMin, in 
fact, gave COM a very slightly condensed version of the 
history monologue and repeated that \"everybody that is 
eligible to participate will participate.\" 
 
9. (C) Participating in the meeting with the PM were 
ambassadors of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, 
Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, and the Delegation of the 
European Commission (all eight resident in Bangkok), along 
with the ambassadors of Germany, France, Italy, and the 
United Kingdom (resident in Rangoon).  The Irish 
ambassador-designate (accredited and resident in Malaysia) 
was also present for the EU meeting on ECHO operations and 
for the COM\'s meeting with EU reps.  However, as Ireland has 
not formalized diplomatic relations with the GOB he did not 
attend the meeting with the PM (FYI: Irish ambassador told 
COM he was excluded due to some bumbling but was told the 
following day, at his meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister 
Khin Maung Win, that the PM had been \"expecting him\" along 
with the other EU reps.  End FYI.) 
 
10. (C) Comment: It seems that the EU assemblage was careful 
not to send the signal that the regime\'s current 
\"democratization\" efforts are being viewed through the same 
rose-colored glasses worn by ASEAN, China and India.  The 
regime has not tried to reap any particular PR benefits from 
this meeting as press coverage has been minimal.  The 
non-resident EU ambassadors seemed more frustrated with the 
slow progress and lack of time frame for the road map than 
those who are resident and used to \"SPDC time\", especially 
when it comes to any commitment to the release of ASSK.  End

1. (S) Summary: Burma\'s efforts to fight terrorist financing 
suffer from several systemic and policy problems -- including 
corruption, a massive informal economy, and lack of 
professional capacity.  Likewise, the GOB has been slow to 
complete its UN reporting requirements and has not yet taken 
action against any individual or entity listed by the UNSC. 
However, the regime is taking steps to improve its money 
laundering regime and it remains cooperative with USG 
counterterrorism priorities in Burma.  Furthermore, we have 
no evidence that any assets of designated individuals or 
groups are being held in Burma -- though the nature of 
Burma\'s informal financial system make assurances impossible. 
 Now that Burma has a legal framework and investigative unit 
to fight terrorist-related money laundering, it could be the 
time to develop a low-level USG-GOB cooperative relationship 
on this issue -- much as we have, with positive results, on 
narcotics.  End summary. 
 
No Banking System, No Capacity = Big Problem? 
 
2. (C) There are several systemic obstacles hindering Burma\'s 
efforts to effectively monitor and control financial crimes, 
including terrorist financing.  First, the banking system in 
Burma is in shambles.  Private banks are only gradually 
returning to life after a year\'s hiatus following a massive 
bank run in February 2003.  The government has yet to allow 
two of the three largest (by asset and deposit) pre-run 
private banks to return to action.  State-owned banks, 
including several quasi-state banks managed and owned by the 
military, were not affected by the banking crisis, though 
they attract few customers.  These banks instead provide 
cheap (or free) credit for various GOB-priority projects. 
Only the three state-owned foreign trade banks are allowed to 
handle foreign exchange deposits and transactions. 
 
3. (C) A second problem is the country\'s traditional, and 
continued, reliance on the informal economy -- including a 
large hundi/hawallah network (ref D).  This network, which is 
used by all sectors of Burmese society, is loosely organized, 
which makes monitoring and enforcement very difficult.  This 
problem is exacerbated by a third systemic shortcoming, which 
is the dire lack of capacity and knowledge of financial crime 
among Burmese law enforcement agencies.  This knowledge gap 
is due to the failure, until very recently, of the GOB to 
focus on financial crime and money laundering, and also due 
to U.S. sanctions that prohibit or discourage cooperation 
with and assistance to GOB officials.  The USG is not able to 
invite GOB officials to ILEA training, for example. 
 
4. (C) Finally, Burma suffers a problem that is common to 
many other countries: corruption.  Extremely low wages for 
GOB officials, combined with poor education and training, 
make Burma\'s law enforcers and financial watchdogs highly 
susceptible to turning a blind eye. 
 
One Step Forward, A Half Step Back 
 
5. (C) The GOB is taking steps to improve its ability to 
prevent illegal use of the financial system, however.  Over 
the past few months, the GOB has issued the regulations 
necessary to implement a 2002 law that for the first time 
explicitly criminalizes money laundering associated with a 
number of crimes -- including terrorism (ref B).  Prior to 
2002 only narcotics-related money laundering could be 
prosecuted.  Burma\'s banks will now be required to file 
reports on suspicious transactions, or those above a 
threshold amount believed to be 100 million kyat (around 
US$120,000).  (Note: the GOB has not announced the threshold 
amount, only that it has set one.)  The law also establishes 
a Financial Investigative Unit (FIU), headed by a 
well-respected Police Colonel currently in the 
counternarcotics agency, dedicated to investigating financial 
crimes. 
 
6. (C) With each positive step the GOB takes, however, it is 
hampered by other policies that will make more difficult the 
prevention of money laundering.  First, continued economic 
mismanagement is pushing more and more of the economy 
underground (including financial services), driving out 
foreign investors, and crippling the private banking system. 
As the GOB\'s hard currency reserves dwindle, in part due to 
the 2003 U.S. sanctions that ban the remittance of U.S. 
dollars to Burma, the GOB is increasingly turning a blind eye 
to or even encouraging the unlimited import of foreign 
exchange by whatever means available. 
 
7. (C) Likewise, there remains a conflict of interest in the 
monitoring of the country\'s informal financial system.  The 
new FIU chief has pledged strong action on controlling the 
hundi system -- illegal under Burmese law.   However, with 
legal remittances of foreign currency made extraordinarily 
difficult by antiquated foreign exchange control laws and new 
U.S. sanctions, senior GOB and military officials and 
business cronies of the government rely even more on hundi 
for expatriating their holdings and importing dollars needed 
for local business ventures.  Also, it is well known that the 
Military Intelligence service, which trumps all when it comes 
to investigative and law enforcement matters, is often making 
money from this same hundi system, either as operators or by 
taking bribes from operators (ref D). 
 
How About the 1455 Report? 
 
8. (C) Burma is one of the 108 countries that is tardy in its 
submission of the report mandated by UNSC Resolution 1455 
(ref C).  In addition, Burma\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
corroborates there have been no actions taken by the GOB 
against any individual or entity listed pursuant to UNSC 
counterterrorism resolutions.  However, as the deputy 
director of MOFA\'s international organizations office (a 
longtime UN veteran) told us, Burma had been among the first 
to issue a UNSC Resolution 1373 report and was currently 
working on its third 1373 submission.  He explained that the 
GOB thought completion of the 1373 reporting was first 
priority, but that the 1455 report would be released \"soon.\" 
He stressed, though, that the delay in submission in no way 
indicated a flagging of the GOB\'s determination to be a good 
partner in the UN\'s terrorism fight. 
 
Nothing We Know Of 
 
9. (S) To the best of our knowledge there is no evidence that 
terrorist groups are using Burma\'s banking system or that 
designated individuals or groups have assets in Burma. 
However, the nature of Burma\'s informal financial system 
makes assurances impossible.  On counterterrorism in general, 
cooperation with the GOB has been good.  Burma is a police 
state and is very cautious and mindful of anyone that might 
cause a disturbance.  Burma\'s leadership knows that any 
domestic entity that is anti-American would likely be 
anti-regime first. 
 
Comment: A USG Role if We Want It 
 
10. (C) It is up to the ruling SPDC to make the type of 
systemic and policy changes necessary for Burma to put in 
place a functional anti-terrorist financing regime.  However, 
the USG could certainly assist along the margins.  Providing 
small-scale technical assistance of some variety to the 
professional members of the FIU would pay dividends: adding 
badly needed capacity, removing an excuse the GOB can use for 
not complying with its money laundering law, and making 
Burma\'s working-level law enforcers better partners in the 
War on Terror.  As we\'ve seen with our limited cooperative 
relationship with front line Burmese counternarcotics forces, 
a little can go a very long way here.  End comment.

Summary. 
 
2. (C) On March 5, COM met with Leon de Reidmatten (UN 
Special Envoy (SE) Tan Sri Razali\'s man in Rangoon) and got a 
readout of Special Envoy Razali twelfth visit to Rangoon. De 
Reidmatten was present at Razali\'s two meetings with Aung San 
Suu Kyi (ASSK) and accompanied the SE to the meeting with 
Prime Minister (PM) Khin Nyunt (but was not privy to the 
actual meeting).  He also took part in the SE\'s meeting with 
U Tin Oo (the senior NLD leader only recently released from 
prison into house arrest), and accompanied the SE to a 
meeting with Labor Minister U Tin Winn. 
 
3. (C) De Reidmatten confirmed that Razali had complied with 
the SPDC\'s instructions forbidding any formal meetings with 
diplomatic representatives (read EU and the U.S.).  He also 
said that Razali had requested a second meeting with the PM 
but it never came about.  The SE also requested a meeting 
with General Maung Aye (the Army Commander in Chief), but the 
PM said there was no need for this as \"Maung Aye is with me.\" 
 The SE\'s request for a meeting with SPDC Chairman Senior 
General (SG) Than Shwe was met with the excuse that the SG 
was traveling, \"probably on purpose\", according to de 
Reidmatten. 
 
4. (C) De Reidmatten emphasized the following points: 
 
-  Razali said that the PM wanted a new role for Razali that 
would move the process forward - he wanted the SE to be more 
than a \"facilitator.\" 
 
- the PM made \"very clear\" to the SE that all parties would 
be invited to participate in the National Convention. 
 
-  Razali believes that the PM has \"internal problems\" in 
that Than Shwe is an obstacle to moving the process forward. 
 
- the PM has little room to maneuver and is \"at the mercy\" of 
Than Shwe. 
 
-  the PM said the SE\'s proposal for a tripartite group 
(government, NLD, ethnic groups) to initiate a dialogue on 
the transition process was \"premature\" and progress could 
only be made \"step by step.\" 
 
-  the PM was anxious to tout progress in the regime\'s 
dialogue with ASSK, showing photos of three meetings between 
her and the Deputy Chief of Military Intelligence, General 
Kyaw Win. 
 
-  The PM made a point that the regime \"does not want 
interference in its dealings with the NLD.\" 
 
5. (C) De Reidmatten said that Razali\'s strategy is to 
\"strengthen Khin Nyunt\" by getting other countries that have 
influence with the regime (read Than Shwe) to push for more 
support for the PM (de Reidmatten suggested that it would be 
very useful if the U.S. could approach the Chinese to use 
their influence in this capacity).  De Reidmatten provided 
COM with a draft of the planned March 5 press release by 
UNSYG Annan which states \"The Special Envoy believes that the 
PM should be given a full mandate to follow through on the 
transition to democracy.\" 
 
6. (C) De Reidmatten\'s readout of the SE\'s two meetings with 
ASSK had some highs and lows.  ASSK appears to be in fine 
health and spirits, \"better than ever.\"  However, she is 
frustrated by the fact that although the regime told her in 
November that she would meet with the PM in December, Than 
Shwe has blocked the encounter. 
 
7. (C) ASSK also wants out - now! She asked Razali to push 
hard for her release, and for the release of the three other 
members of the NLD Central Executive Committee that remain 
under house arrest.  She said that the SPDC road map is a 
possible way to achieve change, but unless she is free to 
work with the NLD leadership there can be no negotiations. 
De Reidmatten quotes her as saying \"after all it (read the 
NLD) is a democracy even if I am the boss\" and that those who 
claim that remaining under house arrest is part of her 
political strategy are absolutely wrong.  Razali plans to 
make this clear in the UNSYG statement to be released March 
5. 
 
8. (C) ASSK told Razali that she was very supportive of the 
sanctions and that she had told the SPDC that she was.  De 
Reidmatten said ASSK was angry about the regime\'s accusations 
that she was too much under the influence of the U.S. and the 
U.K., and said that such accusations \"were an insult.\"  ASSK 
also said she was aware of the efforts of the Unites States 
and the U.K. on behalf of her, and her party, and was deeply 
appreciative. 
 
9. (C) ASSK said she recognizes the efforts of the PM and 
feels that he is trying to move the process along.  She said 
she that she is willing to work with the PM.  But, according 
to de Reidmatten (who knows her very well) the possibility of 
ASSK and Than Shwe ever having a dialogue is becoming more 
remote.  ASSK will talk to Than Shwe if she has to, but there 
is so much bad history between them that it will probably not 
result in anything positive. 
 
10. (C) Moving to the SE\'s other meetings, de Reidmatten 
characterized the meeting with U Tin Oo as being more for the 
purpose of verifying the elderly NLD leader\'s state of health 
(good).  U Tin Oo was surprised to see the SE - he had been 
brought to a government guest house by his MI warders and was 
expecting to see ASSK.  U Tin Oo was reluctant to speak on 
anything other than the events of May 30 (confirming what we 
all know - it was brutal and government sponsored).  As to 
the meeting with Labor Minister U Tin Winn, de Reidmatten 
said it was useless and not worth recounting.  Razali had 
tried to engage the Labor Minister on various subjects, to no 
avail. 
 
11. (C) Despite the fact that Razali\'s UN handlers said there 
would be no meetings or briefings for diplomats, Razali did 
have some meetings with individual diplomats, including a 
private meeting with the Japanese ambassador and a three-way 
meeting with the French Ambassador and the German Charge. 
There was also a spur of the moment lunch with the Malaysian, 
Australian and Italian ambassadors. 
 
12. (C) Comment:  The fact that Razali came and met with ASSK 
twice is good - as is the news that she is even more open to 
dialogue with the regime.  If the SPDC continues in the farce 
that she is not under house arrest or that she is \"at home\" 
voluntarily, then it will once again prove their callous 
insincerity.  As to the PM\'s protests of wanting to do his 
best but being hog-tied by the Senior General, we should 
remain skeptical - especially after his alleged comment that 
\"Maung Aye is with me.\"  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA: FOURTH ANNUAL TIP REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 07869 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The following report responds to the 
checklist provided in reftel requesting information on 
trafficking in persons activities in Burma from March 2003 to 
March 2004.  The report will also be forwarded by e-mail to 
EAP/BCLTV in MS Word format.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BEGIN REPORT 
 
Overview of Country\'s Activities: 
 
A. Burma is a country of origin for international trafficking 
of men, women, and children, for sexual and labor 
exploitation.  Internal trafficking for sexual exploitation 
and forced labor also occurs.  There are no reliable 
estimates of the magnitude of the international or internal 
trafficking.  The government does not effectively collect 
such information and, due to strict government controls over 
information flow, there are no independent assessments of the 
problem.  The government has no estimate for the number of 
people trafficked in 2003.  However, other sources generally 
estimate that there are thousands of trafficking victims each 
year, primarily destined for Thailand.  Sources for 
information on trafficking include the Government of Burma, 
government affiliated non-governmental organizations, 
international non-governmental organizations, diplomatic 
missions, and UN offices in Burma.  Women and girls are the 
primary international trafficking and internal trafficking 
victims while internal forced labor appears to include 
victims of all ages and both sexes. 
 
B.  Internationally, Burmese men, women, and children are 
trafficked primarily to Thailand for factory, fishing, and 
sex industry work, but also to China, Bangladesh, Taiwan, 
India, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, Macao, and Japan. 
Internally, trafficking of women and girls occurs from 
villages throughout the country to urban centers and to other 
centers for  prostitution such as trucking crossroads, 
fishing villages, border towns, and mining camps. 
 
C.  In 2003 the United States imposed an import ban on 
Burmese products, which played a role in the closure of 
numerous garment factories.  Several NGOs expressed concerns 
that former garment workers, especially young women, may be 
at an increased risk of trafficking.  There has been no 
discernible change in the direction or extent of trafficking 
in recent years, although, although there is no effective 
monitoring of the problem. 
 
D.  An international NGO is conducting a limited survey on 
women trafficked into the sex industry and expects to make 
conclusions in 2004.  Also, in May of 2004 the UN and the GOB 
plan to create a joint trafficking in persons database. 
However, the GOB has not planned to carry out any surveys to 
document the nature and extent of trafficking in Burma.  Post 
is unaware of reports from any surveys conducted last year. 
The International Labor Organization confided that forced 
labor still occurs in ethnic areas where the military has an 
operational presence, but there is no accurate estimate of 
the number of victims per year. 
 
E.  Burma is a destination point for possibly hundreds of 
Chinese and number of East European females working as 
prostitutes in brothels and casinos in Special Regions #1, 2, 
and 4  along the China/Burma border in Shan State.  These 
women, some of whom actually believe they are in China, 
provide sexual services primarily to Chinese businessmen and 
tourists.  Post has no information whether these women have 
been trafficked, or if they came specifically seeking work in 
the sex industry. 
 
F.  Poverty is the driving force behind trafficking in 
persons in Burma.  It is often the case of voluntary economic 
migrants being targeted and exploited by \"brokers\" at the 
Burmese border, or upon arrival in the country of 
destination.  Girls in poor families are the most at risk. 
Also at risk are boys and members of minority ethnic groups. 
The traffickers at the village level are often women 
returning from working in Thai factories or the sex industry 
who provide a \"connection\" for the local girls.  Traffickers 
may promise a restaurant job or educational opportunities, 
but once over the border the victim ends up in the 
entertainment or sex industry, or in an abusive domestic job. 
 Victims are generally trafficked by the cheapest means 
available, in the back of trucks or in buses.  Because of 
tight travel controls near border areas, victims would 
typically require false documentation such as fake family 
registration certificates, or bribes to make it through 
military, immigration, and customs check-points, or through 
the many \"unofficial\" border crossings controlled by 
cease-fire and anti-government groups.  Several sources 
reported that once across the border the victims are often 
turned over to Thai police who use official vehicles to move 
the victims further into the Thailand. 
 
G.  During the year, international agencies and NGOs credited 
the government for demonstrating political will to combat 
trafficking and for improvement in cooperation with UN 
agencies and NGOs.  GOB efforts include a national seminar in 
May 2003 on trafficking, media awareness campaigns, and the 
arrest and prosecution of 518 traffickers and smugglers since 
July 2002.  The GOB set up a 40-person Anti-trafficking 
national police unit in March 2004, co-located with 
Australian government funded Asia Regional Cooperation to 
Prevent People Trafficking (ARCPPT).  On the issue of forced 
labor, however, the government has continued to do the 
minimal necessary to avoid the implementation of measures by 
ILO member states.   Although the numbers are difficult to 
quantify, the military continues to forcibly conscript 
soldiers, including children.  However, the government no 
longer denies the existence of the child soldier problem.  In 
two recent cases, the ILO was able to obtain the release of 
two underage soldiers.  The GOB wrote a letter to the ILO 
acknowledging the existence of the two child soldiers.  In 
January 2004, the GOB has established a national-level 
working group to address the issue of recruiting under-age 
soldiers for the Burmese army.  There have been no 
prosecutions to our knowledge of government officials linked 
to TIP or of Army personnel involved in forced labor.  The 
GOB will not identify any funding specifically allocated for 
TIP.  The government generally tasks groups to achieve policy 
initiatives without providing sufficient funding.  For 
instance, the most active government organization on 
trafficking, the Myanmar National Committee on Women\'s 
Affairs (MNCWA), depends wholly on donations and volunteers 
to implement its programs. 
 
H.  The Home Affairs Ministry states there is no complicity 
of GOB officials in trafficking.  However, NGOs report that 
government officials are complicit in trafficking, although 
it appears limited to local or regional officials who are 
supplementing meager salaries by taking payment for turning a 
blind eye to trafficking activities.  According to one 
report,  Village and Township-level Peace and Development 
Councils (local variant of the SPDC) earn money from 
trafficking, and also from skimming remittances from migrants 
working in Thailand.  There are some reports that the Office 
of the Chief of Military Intelligence (OCMI, the internal 
intelligence service) controls some brothels, hotels, and 
karaoke bars, and, by extension, may be involved in 
trafficking.  We do not have reliable information on the 
extent to which this is happening.  There have been no 
reports of punitive measures taken against these individuals. 
 Military officials and township officials are reported to be 
directly involved in trafficking for forced labor inside the 
country.  This practice is worst in the border areas.  There 
have been no prosecutions of government officials for either 
trafficking or forced labor. 
 
I.  The GOB set up a repatriation center on the Burma-Thai 
border, which has processed 10,427 illegal migrants returning 
from Thailand since September 2001.  The GOB also provided 
reintegration support to six trafficked girls repatriated 
from Thailand and to three trafficked girls repatriated from 
Malaysia.   However, the government\'s ability to address 
trafficking in persons is limited by the lack of funding 
allocated for social programs.  Burma is among the lowest 
ranked countries in the world for per capita expenditures on 
health, education, and social welfare services.  The 
government over the past 15 years has drastically cut funding 
for social services in order to fund military priorities. 
This trend continues still.  Also, because of the 
government\'s serious economic mismanagement, poverty and 
widespread corruption have become the norm.  Economic 
desperation is continually cited as the root cause of sex 
trafficking in the country. 
 
Prevention: 
 
A.  Yes, the government publicly acknowledges that 
trafficking in persons is a serious problem in Burma.  The 
government has also indirectly acknowledged that forced labor 
is a serious problem by allowing the presence of the ILO in 
Burma.  The government has publicly acknowledged it has a 
problem with recruiting child soldiers, and in January 2004 
announced the establishment of a ministerial-level Committee 
for the Prevention of the Recruitment of Child Soldiers to 
address the problem.  However, the efficacy of this committee 
has not yet been demonstrated. 
 
B.  The Ministry of Home Affairs is the lead agency in 
anti-trafficking actions for trafficking in persons with 
support from the Ministries of Social Welfare, Immigration, 
and Labor, the Supreme Court, and the Attorney General.  The 
Labor Ministry is the lead agency on forced labor. 
 
C.  The Ministry of Home Affairs says it educated 86,744 
people on trafficking between September 2001 and August 2003. 
 The Social Welfare Bureau\'s six-person Mobile Training Team 
trains State and Township-level social workers on trafficking 
prevention.  Also, the MNCWA has conducted seminars, produced 
and shown videotapes on television, and developed radio 
programs highlighting the perils of trafficking.  On forced 
labor, the government has posted in public places directives 
issued in 1999 and 2000 prohibiting the use of forced labor. 
There has been no assessment of the effectiveness of the 
trafficking awareness campaign.  Forced labor appears to be 
continuing in the ethnic areas in spite of the posting of the 
directives against it, though in the one region for which we 
do have statistics, the data shows forced labor has declined 
in two out of three townships. 
 
D.  Although the MNCWA and other social services 
organizations have programs to provide women with income 
generating skills and to encourage women to take a greater 
role in the community, these programs are dwarfed by the 
desperate conditions of most women in the country.  Given the 
government\'s absence of funding for these programs (they are 
largely \"self-sustaining\"), they reach only a small 
percentage of the women in need. 
 
E.  Due to budget constraints, the GOB does not support its 
prevention activities very well.  For example, the six-person 
Social Welfare Bureau\'s Mobile Training Team is limited in 
funding and is unable to spend much time out in the provinces 
conducting training.  The Bureau plans to split the team into 
two groups of three in increase its coverage this year. 
 
F.  Government ministries have an increasingly good 
relationship with UN agencies and NGOs that are concerned 
with trafficking issues.  The UN and NGO \"Working Group on 
Trafficking\" meets quarterly, and in January 2004 discussed 
ways with the GOB to improve collaboration on GOB/NGO roles 
in repatriation, and to include the NGOs from the start of a 
repatriation case. However, the government attempts to 
control \"civil society\" organizations and ensure that all 
citizens support the policies of the regime.  Local township 
organizations are extensions of the military junta and use a 
combination of a spoils system and intimidation to ensure 
support for government policies.  As a result, the citizenry 
generally attempts to minimize its contacts with these 
organizations.  On the issue of trafficking, citizens are 
encouraged to attend workshops and talks in order to show 
support for the government policies. 
 
G.  The GOB does not adequately monitor its borders, and Post 
is not aware of any monitoring of immigration or emigration 
patterns, or the analysis of such data for patterns of 
trafficking.   While the government controls numerous 
official border crossings, there are probably hundreds of 
other crossings under the control of cease-fire groups, 
anti-government groups, and smugglers.  The Ministry of Home 
Affairs told Emboff it has pointed out to the Immigration 
Ministry that overly tight exit controls on females force 
them to use illegal means to migrate and eliminates legal 
protections that a passport could give them. 
H.  Yes, there is a multi-agency task force under the 
guidance of the Ministry of Home Affairs to address 
trafficking in persons and a Convention 29 Implementation 
Committee under the Ministry of Labor to address forced 
labor.  (See Prevention - \"B.\")  There is a public corruption 
task force, but it is not allowed to investigate public 
officials unless directed to do so by OCMI.  In October 2003 
the GOB contacted a Rangoon-based Australian Aid organization 
(Asia Regional Cooperation to Prevent People Trafficking) to 
set up a 40-person Anti-Trafficking Police Unit under the 
Director General of the Burmese National Police Force.  The 
unit is scheduled to open in April of 2004 and will have a 
40-person office in Rangoon, 6 Task Forces, and 10 provincial 
units. 
 
I.  The MNCWA participates in regional and world conferences 
on women\'s issues, including trafficking.  The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs is in the final stages of drafting an MOU 
with the Thai government on repatriation.  However, there has 
not been any regional coordination on specific interventions 
to prevent, monitor, or control sex trafficking. 
 
J.  The MNCWA developed a national plan to address 
trafficking in 2002 in coordination with the relevant 
ministries including Social Welfare, Immigration, and Home 
Affairs.  The plan was coordinated with UNIAP.  There is no 
national plan to address the issue of forced labor, though 
one was prepared in 2003 by the ILO.  That plan was shelved 
following a May 2003 attack by government thugs on the leader 
of the pro-democracy opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her 
convoy. 
 
K.  The Myanmar Women\'s Affairs Federation (MWAF) and the 
Preventive Committee for Trafficking in Person are 
responsible for developing anti-Trafficking programs within 
the GOB.   The Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, Brigadier 
General Thura Myint Maung, is the Chairman of the Human 
Trafficking Prevention Work Committee.  The Minister of Labor 
is the person responsible for addressing forced labor. 
 
Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers: 
 
A.  There currently is no law specifically prohibiting 
trafficking in persons.  As was the case last year, the laws 
used to prosecute human traffickers are a combination of laws 
against kidnapping and prostitution.  However, the Attorney 
General, with the help of the Ministry of Home Affairs, has 
drafted a new law specifically targeting traffickers, 
although it has not yet been promulgated. 
 
B.  Sentences for trafficking in persons have traditionally 
ranged up to 10 years with hard labor, with a recent increase 
of the maximum penalty to life in prison.  Most cases carry a 
sentence of five or more year\'s imprisonment.  136 cases 
received the maximum sentence between July 2002 and December 
2003.   Traffickers who have been sentenced are serving their 
terms. 
 
C.  Penalties for prostitution are up to ten years 
imprisonment, sexual assault of an adult is up to two years, 
and sexual assault of a minor is up to ten years. 
 
D.  The government states that it has prosecuted 294 cases 
against \"540 brokers and traffickers\" (304 male and 236 
female) since July 2002.  1,475 \"victims\" were identified 
(795 males 650 females).  The Ministry of Home Affairs admits 
that some of those cases involve human smugglers and not 
traffickers.  There have been no prosecutions relating to 
forced labor. 
 
E.  Human traffickers appear to be primarily free-lance 
small-scale operators using village contacts that feed into 
more established trafficking \"brokers.\"  There is no evidence 
of travel or tourism agencies being involved in the 
trafficking.  There are multiple reports that low-level and 
regional government official are involved in trafficking (see 
Overview section answer \"H\").  Except for the report of 
Village and Township-level Peace and Development Councils 
earning money from trafficking, and also from skimming 
remittances from migrants working in Thailand, Post has no 
other information on the destination of trafficking profits. 
However, the new Police Task Force will have a money 
laundering unit set up to investigate this issue.  Human 
trafficking relating to forced labor is directed by the 
military and supported by township and regional military 
officials who arrange to meet the military\'s localized labor 
requirements. 
F.  The prosecutions of traffickers that we have reviewed 
indicate that most arrests occur as the result of \"tip-offs\" 
from the MNCWA to local police rather than investigations. 
While the government maintains extensive and intrusive 
controls over the population, trafficking in humans is not 
the target of these efforts. 
 
G.  The Social Welfare Bureau Mobile Training Teams, 
comprised of Deputy Director-level staff from the Attorney 
General\'s office, Ministry of Education, Department of Social 
Welfare, Myanmar Women Affairs Federation, Department of 
Immigration, and the Police Force have trained 300 
township-level officials in 10 states.  Also, AusAid will 
train the new Police Task Force.  UNIAP and Save the Children 
(UK) conduct workshops that touch on this aspect of 
trafficking. 
 
H.  There is some sharing of information between the Ministry 
of Home Affairs and the Thai Government on some trafficking 
issues.  However, there is not yet cooperation in 
investigating and prosecuting trafficking cases.  The Social 
Welfare Bureau told Emboff that MOFA is currently preparing 
an MOU on cooperation with Thailand (see Prevention answer 
\"I\").  The Ministry of Labor signed an MOU on \"Cooperation in 
Employment\" with the Thai Ministry of Labor in June 2003, 
part of which is aimed at suppressing trafficking to 
Thailand.  The Ministry of Labor is proposing procedures to 
implement local level cross-border cooperation called for in 
the MOU. 
 
I.  No, there have been no extradition of human traffickers 
to other countries.  Burmese law prevents the extradition of 
nationals except under exceptional circumstances. 
 
J/K.  Given the pervasive government control that exists over 
the activities of all citizens, some tolerance and/or 
collusion of low-level provincial government officials in 
human trafficking is assumed in order for the practice to 
continue on a large scale (see Overview section answer \"H\"). 
On forced labor, the military is the driving force behind the 
practice, and there have been no related arrests or 
prosecutions. 
 
L.  The government signed ILO convention 29 on Forced and 
Compulsory Labor in 1955.  Burma is considering becoming 
party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (CRC) on the sale of children, child 
prostitution, and child pornography, but has not signed yet. 
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the \"Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children\" has been approved by the 
cabinet and is awaiting the Foreign Minister\'s signature. 
 
Protection and Assistance to Victims: 
 
A.  The Myanmar Women\'s Affairs Federation (MWAF) and the 
Social Welfare Department jointly assisted trafficking 
victims with counseling and job training at care centers 
before the women are returned to their families.  The MWAF 
states that in 2003 a total of  150 victims were counseled at 
these facilities.  HIV/AIDS screening is available, though 
there have been a few reported cases of involuntary testing. 
 
B.  No, the government does not provide funding to foreign or 
domestic NGOs for services to victims.  Foreign NGOs continue 
to provide some services and support to the government and 
local NGOs beginning for the second year.   International 
NGOs have coordinated a limited number of victim 
repatriations with the government and local NGOs and continue 
provided public awareness materials to the government. 
 
C.  There is a screening process in place to transfer victims 
detained in Thailand to an NGO based in Burma that does 
provide long-term care.  There are no reports of victims 
being arrested inside Burma. 
D.  There is a good understanding of the need to protect 
victims, especially those returning from international 
trafficking.  We have heard of no returning victims being 
arrested or jailed. 
 
E.  There has not been much focus on this aspect of human 
trafficking in public awareness campaigns to date and we know 
of no case in which the victims have filed suit against 
traffickers.  In the area of forced labor, victims do not 
have an adequate mechanism for lodging complaints or seeking 
prosecutions. 
 
F.  We do not have any information on the level of protection 
the government can or does provide witnesses in trafficking 
cases. 
 
G.  The Social Welfare Bureau\'s Mobile Training Teams provide 
training to government officials on the recognition and 
provision of assistance to victims of human trafficking. 
Post is unable to determine if training has been provided to 
Burmese embassy staff in other countries and we have no 
information that these staff have instructions on engaging 
with NGOs working with trafficking victims.  However, the 
Burmese embassy in Bangkok does provide consular and 
investigative assistance to trafficking victims brought to 
its attention. 
 
H.  The GOB provides medical assistance and shelter to 
trafficking victims who are identified as victims during 
repatriation from Thailand.  See \"A\" and \"B\" above; also 
\"Overview - I.\" 
 
I.  Save the Children UK and World Vision work with 
trafficking victims in Burma.

SUBJECT: BURMA DENIES NUCLEAR OR MISSILE LINKS WITH NORTH 
KOREA 
 
Classified By: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES, A.I. RONALD K. MCMULLEN. 
REASON 1.4 (B & H). 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY:  Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win told 
the CDA, a.i. March 9 that Burma \"has no links whatever with 
North Korea regarding nuclear technology or missile 
technology,\" and has no intentions of buying missiles or 
missile technology from North Korea.  He allowed that Burma 
had purchased some (unspecified) equipment from North Korea 
previously and that North Korea had offered to sell Burma 
missiles.  \"We have no intention of buying any missiles or 
missile technology from North Korea,\" he averred.  Burma\'s 
plans for a nuclear reactor are still on the drawing board, 
he continued, and \"would be for purely research purposes.\" 
He said Burma was \"not very keen\" on reestablishing 
diplomatic relations with North Korea, and wanted us to know 
that North Korea would \"most likely\" attend the ARF 
inter-sessional group meeting in Rangoon in April.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Burmese Deputy Foreign Minister Khin Maung Win called 
in the Charge\' d\'Affaires, a.i. March 9 to \"set the record 
straight regarding media and Congressional allegations\" on 
Burma\'s relations with North Korea, particularly in two 
fields: a) nuclear and missile technology, b) narcotics 
trafficking.  MFA\'s Director General for Political Affairs 
and the Director of the Americas Division also attended the 
meeting. 
 
3. (S) The Deputy Foreign Minister got straight to the point, 
claiming that Burma has \"no links whatever\" to North Korea in 
the area of missiles, missile technology, or nuclear 
technology.  \"At one point we bought some equipment from 
North Korea, but actually this has stopped.\"  KMW also 
revealed that \"North Korea offered missiles.\"  He went on to 
avow that Burma has no intention of buying missiles or 
missile technology from North Korea.  He said Burma\'s stated 
interest in acquiring a nuclear reactor is public knowledge, 
but the process \"is still on the drawing board, and in any 
case would be for research purposes only.\" 
 
4.  (S) Regarding rumored speculation that a North Korean 
shipment of heroin seized off Australia was evidence of 
Burmese and North Korean collusion, KMW denied any link 
between the GOB and North Korean drug running.  CDA, a.i. 
noted that Burmese narcotics police had recently provided a 
variety of local heroin samples to U.S. law enforcement 
authorities and that \"fingerprinting\" processes might help 
identify the origins of a particular heroin shipment and 
perhaps help dispel any false accusations. 
 
5. (C) Khin Maung Win said that while North Korea has \"made 
some approaches, we are not very keen to establish diplomatic 
relations with North Korea.\"  The Deputy Foreign Minister 
said that Burma had invited North Korea to the ARF 
inter-sessional group meeting to be held in Rangoon next 
month purely in the context of ARF membership.  North Korea 
has not yet officially replied, he stated, but a North Korean 
delegation is \"most likely coming.\"  He mentioned this, he 
explained, so as not to \"surprise\" the United States on this 
issue. 
 
6. (C) The CDA, a.i. raised UN Special Envoy Razali\'s recent 
visit and pressed for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the 
other political prisoners.  The Deputy Foreign Minister said 
Razali felt his visit had gone well, but KMW added nothing 
about a release of ASSK or anyone else.  The CDA, a.i. noted 
that March 12 is NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo\'s 77th birthday, 
adding that after such a long spell in prison and now under 
house arrest, he should be given special consideration.  No 
response from the DFM, but he did smile when the CDA, a.i. 
threatened to deliver a birthday cake to U Tin Oo\'s home. 
 
7.  (SBU) After exchanging updates on the progress of the 
joint Opium Yield Survey currently under way in Shan State 
and the WWII Remains Recovery operation being conducted in 
Kachin State, the CDA, a.i. gave the DFM a copy of the 
February 22 Parade Magazine which featured Senior General 
Than Shwe as #2 in a list of the world\'s top ten worst 
dictators.  He explained that the magazine was private and 
that the article was not a statement of USG policy. 
\"Sometimes critical information from Washington, like that in 
our Human Rights Report, is official, but in this case it was 
not,\" the CDA, a.i. said.  The DFM thanked the CDA, a.i and 
asked him to convey to the Department the GOB\'s message on 
North Korea. 
 
8.  (C) COMMENT:  The Deputy Foreign Minister\'s denial of any 
link between North Korea and Burma in the nuclear, missile, 
or narcotics fields was about as categorical as possible. 
Whether it is true or not is another matter.  Post is 
somewhat puzzled by the timing of this meeting, but was glad 
of the opportunity to discuss with the GOB serious policy 
matters.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: CAMPUS COMMOTION: RANGOON AND MYITKYINA STUDENT 
PROTESTS 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: According to Embassy sources, recent 
student-led protests over administrative issues at two 
university campuses, one located in a Rangoon suburb and the 
other in Kachin State in northern Burma, resulted in military 
intervention to restore \"order.\"  These reports indicate the 
regime remains determined to prohibit even minor dissent on 
the country\'s few remaining campuses.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) In mid-March, several hundred students at a government 
computer science institute in Hlawgar, located some 20 miles 
north of central Rangoon, reportedly boycotted classes to 
protest against a lecturer in a dispute involving attendance 
issues.  As a result, school authorities identified 175 
students (about 75 percent of the student body) as ineligible 
to sit for final exams for failure to attend regular classes. 
 The ruling led to a spontaneous demonstration and the 
institute\'s rector appealed to Rangoon\'s Military Commander, 
who dispatched troops o/a March 16 to take control of the 
campus. 
 
3. (C) In a separate incident, o/a March 11 several hundred 
students at Myitkyina University in Kachin State reportedly 
massed at a downtown police station to protest the arrest of 
two fellow students who had refused demands from a police 
officer for bribe money.  Military units intervened to assist 
police in quelling the protest and arrested as many as ten 
students.  Sources claim that the university has remained 
closed since March 11.  Although international media sources 
have reported the events in Myitkyina and claims that 
soldiers fired warning shots, Embassy officers who visited 
the city on March 17 reported no unusual activity or evidence 
of lingering tensions. 
 
4. (C) Comment:  The SPDC closed most urban campuses in the 
early 1990s as a result of 1988 student political 
demonstrations.  The few \"satellite\" and \"distance learning\" 
campuses that have reopened in recent years are located in 
remote, rural locations as a means to discourage student 
activism.  These recent, seemingly minor, student actions 
appear to be innocuous administrative protests.  However, 
reports of military intervention indicate the depth of regime 
paranoia regarding campuses as potential hotbeds of political 
activism.  End comment.

Classified By: COM Carmen M. Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY: Burma is interested in new program 
possibilities under the President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS 
Relief (ref A) and has requested further consultations with 
the Embassy and USAID Bangkok to examine details of what the 
emergency plan actually means for Burma.  Probably for 
reasons of control, the GOB says it is worried that the new 
plan could lead to an unmanageable and counterproductive 
plethora of NGOs in Burma.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) COM and Poloff met on March 18 with MOFA Political 
Director General U Thaung Tun to discuss our letter delivered 
February 26 (reftel B) on the President\'s Emergency Plan for 
AIDS Relief.  According to Thaung Tun, the GOB welcomes the 
President\'s new plan and applauds the U.S. fight against 
HIV/AIDS on a global scale.  He added that Burma would like 
more details on how the plan will work, and requested that 
the Embassy and USAID in Bangkok discuss specifics with the 
Ministry of Health in the near future at the Director General 
or Deputy Director General level.  Discussions should include 
clarification on the plan\'s time frame, funding, and the 
geographical area to be covered. 
 
3.  (C) The DG evidenced concern about the plan causing an 
increase in the number of NGOs in Burma.  He said too many 
NGOs working the problem would be counter productive, and 
iterated that any new NGOs would have to arrange MOUs 
individually with the appropriate ministry before operating 
in Burma.  The COM pointed out that the President\'s Emergency 
Plan will likely use existing mechanisms (currently 
supporting four NGOs) for any new funds, including U.S. 
contributions to the Global Fund and to UN agencies that 
address HIV/AIDS in Burma. 
 
4.  (C) The COM raised the need for the GOB to allow NGOs to 
conduct HIV testing, pointing out that 20 percent of NGO 
clients never come back for test results or post-test 
counseling due to a one-week wait imposed by government 
testing labs.  Exchange rates also need to be rationalized 
for the international agencies and NGOs. The present official 
exchange rate of Kyat 450 to $1 is far more expensive to NGOs 
and international agencies than the going street rate of Kyat 
850 to $1 -- not to mention the programming difficulties this 
artificial rate causes. 
 
5.  (C) COMMENT:  The GOB seems to be quite interested in the 
plan\'s new funding possibilities to fight HIV/AIDS over the 
next several years.  The decision to invite the COM in to 
discuss the plan was made at least at the Foreign Minister 
level.  The leadership is also likely concerned about 
controlling a mass of new NGOs descending on Burma to fight 
HIV/AIDS.  We will request USAID Bangkok to assist us in 
going over the plan\'s implications with the Ministry of 
Health.  END COMMENT.

1.  (C) SUMMARY:  MOFA Political Director General U Thaung 
Tun, covering a range of political issues, reiterated to COM 
on March 18 the GOB\'s position that Burma has refused North 
Korea offers to buy missiles and has no intention of resuming 
diplomatic relations with DPRK.  He that although the GOB is 
still training technicians in nuclear technology, Burma has 
shelved plans to build a nuclear reactor with Russian help. 
On internal issues, he reported that the National Convention 
(NC) will be held this calendar year and that GOB Ministries 
have already appointed delegates.  U Thaung Tun categorized 
UN Envoy Razali as being \"upbeat\" on his recent visit, though 
Thaung Tun admitted he was out of the loop on Razali\'s 
meetings with ASSK.  He tantalizingly predicted that the 
pre-May 30 level of interaction between MOFA and the U.S. 
Embassy are about to resume, and urged the COM to \"keep 
knocking because the door is about to open.\"  Chinese Vice 
Premier Wu Yi will visit Burma next week to discuss economic 
issues.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TIES WITH DPRK 
-------------- 
 
2.  (C) During a March 18 meeting to discuss HIV/AIDS (reftel 
A), MOFA Political Director General U Thaung Tun told COM 
that with regard to restoring diplomatic relations with North 
Korea \"we had a lot of overtures from them, but don\'t really 
want them.\"  He reiterated a GOB position recently put forth 
by the Deputy Foreign Minister (ref C) and said that the DPRK 
has \"offered to sell us missiles, but we don\'t have any 
dealings with the North.\"  Since the DPRK is also a member of 
the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), Burma has invited them to 
send a delegation to the ARF meeting in Rangoon in mid-April 
(ref B).  U Thaung Tun has not heard yet if the DPRK will 
attend, and recalled that they didn\'t attend the November ARF 
meeting he co-chaired in Beijing, although that was due to 
the concurrently running six-party talks. 
 
NO MORE NUKES (FOR NOW) 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (C) U Thaung Tun told COM that the government has shelved 
its plan to build a nuclear facility with Russian assistance. 
 He stated that Burma\'s gas fields provide enough energy to 
meet Burma\'s current needs.  However, he added that Burma 
continues to train the technicians that would have been 
needed for the nuclear project, although he did not offer an 
explanation. 
 
THE CHINESE ARE COMING 
---------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The DG also told us MOFA is preoccupied for the next 
week with preparations for a looming visit by a Chinese Vice 
Premier Wu Yi.  Also a State Council Member with an economic 
portfolio, Wu\'s visit will be focusing on economic issues, 
and was arranged to reciprocate Maung Aye\'s visit to China 
last fall. 
 
PM DIALOGUE WITH ASSK 
--------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Asked how the recent visit of UN Special Envoy Razali 
(red d), U Thaung Tun told COM he agreed with the UN press 
release and say Razali \"was upbeat.\"  He added however, that 
\"we don\'t know the details on the visit, those are kept on a 
need-to-know basis.\"  Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt is 
focused on political progress in Burma, and as evidence the 
DG cited the PM\'s meeting with the KNU in January to achieve 
the cease-fire.  Thaung Tun tried to underscore this further 
by explaining that the PM\'s un-named \"high-level emissaries,\" 
though not the PM himself, are meeting with ASSK and there is 
an important dialogue now going on. 
 
RAZALI AND THE ROAD MAP 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (C) The COM noted Razali\'s suggestion that PM Gen Khin 
Nyunt should be given a \"full mandate\" implies there is a 
division in the leadership.  Thaung Tun responded that is was 
more a question of Razali judging Burma from the fact that 
\"we have a collective leadership,\" but quickly added that the 
leaders \"have a consensus now and will move forward with it.\" 
 He added that everyone has to have a say in the NC, 
including the political parties, the ethnic nationalities, 
and the KNU.  COM noted that this should logically mean the 
ASSK will be released and the NLD allowed to participate, 
whereupon Thaung Tun demurred slightly and said that he 
didn\'t want to differ from the Deputy Foreign Minister\'s 
logic on this question. 
 
7.  (C) Thaung Tun told COM that the \"PM says the NC will be 
held this year,\" and that every Ministry has already been 
asked to name representatives.  (NOTE: Americas Division 
Director U Thant Kyaw told Poloff that MOFA officials only of 
much higher rank than his will attend.)  The COM advised the 
DG that if the NC isn\'t held this year, Burma will have no 
credibility on the world stage.  Thaung Tun said he agreed 
with the COM on this, and added that \"the PM is a serious 
person.  To not succeed wouldn\'t only look bad for him, but 
would invite chaos.\"   The DG noted that as proof of the PM\'s 
intentions, intense physical preparations for the National 
Convention (NC) were being made at a place outside Rangoon. 
The NC must have room for all the delegates, including from 
the armed groups.  He thought there would be 800 to 1,000 
delegates vice the 700 delegates for the 1993 convention. 
 
BETTER MOFA-U.S. EMBASSY TIES? 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) The COM asked Thaung Tun if he has passed on the 
Embassy\'s requests for loosening restrictions on MOFA staff 
contacts with U.S. Embassy officials and restoring the level 
of Embassy access to GOB officials to pre-May 30 levels.  The 
DG responded that the message has been passed, and for the 
COM to \"keep knocking, the door\'s about to open.\" 
 
9.  (C) COMMENT: The DG\'s unexpected but not-surprising 
tidbits on their relationship with North Korea indicate that 
the generals are concerned about current U.S. attention to 
Burma-DPRK dealings.  As to the better Embassy-MOFA ties that 
Thaung Tun hinted were soon coming, those would likely 
accompany the opening of the door for ASSK and the NLD and 
the announcement of the national convention.  However, there 
is no official date for the NC, and ASSK is still under house 
arrest.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) Summary:  While spending ten days in remote Shan State 
with a senior military intelligence officer during the annual 
USG-Burma opium yield survey, we were constantly told that 
Prime Minister Khin Nyunt has undertaken a full-court press 
to implement his \"road map\" to democracy.  This focus has 
interesting implications for General Khin Nyunt\'s 
subordinates, who now carry much of the water on his regular 
duties, including relations with Burma\'s ethnic groups.  Our 
principal interlocutor on the survey, Brigadier General Kyaw 
Thein, underscored the political challenges of dealing with 
the country\'s diverse ethnic groups and we observed him 
interact with leaders of cease-fire groups ranging from SPDC 
\"vassals\" to former adversaries who now enjoy considerable 
autonomy.  One measure of the SPDC\'s influence in the ethnic 
areas of Shan State is the manner in which each ethnic group 
treats poppy cultivation.  For some, it is a fading 
extracurricular activity, while for others it is a way of 
life.  End Summary. 
 
General Kyaw Thein 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) Our recent USG-Burma joint opium yield survey, 
conducted throughout remote locations in Shan State March 
3-12, gave us an extended opportunity to exchange views with 
Brigadier General Kyaw Thein, leader of the Burmese survey 
team and a senior official in the Office of the Chief of 
Military Intelligence (OCMI).  Gen. Kyaw Thein had oversight 
of the entire Burmese portion of the opium survey, which 
involved months of preparation, several Burmese military 
aircraft, dozens of extremely remote survey sites, and 
hundreds of military and government personnel. 
 
3. (C) Kyaw Thein, who reports directly to deputy OCMI chief 
General Kyaw Win and OCMI chief (and Prime Minister) General 
Khin Nyunt, has long held the regime\'s lead on narcotics 
issues, including oversight of the Central Committee for 
Drugs Abuse Control (CCDAC), the GOB\'s principal 
counternarcotics unit housed at the Ministry of Home Affairs 
and staffed by police and military intelligence officers. 
Kyaw Thein\'s working title is Chief of the OCMI Internal 
Relations Division (IRD), within the military intelligence 
directorate.

4. (C) Kyaw Thein confided to us that he and several of his 
colleagues have picked up additional duties following the 
appointment of his senior boss, Khin Nyunt, to the Prime 
Minister position in August 2003.  Contrary to general 
speculation, he said, Khin Nyunt did not, and will not, lose 
his existing military intelligence and ethnic relations 
portfolios, nor did he simply take on ceremonial duties as 
Prime Minister.  Rather, General Khin Nyunt had taken on an 
array of new responsibilities as head of government, yet 
counted on his subordinates to carry much of the weight of 
his existing \"work requirements.\" 
 
5. (C) As a result of Khin Nyunt\'s promotion, according to 
Kyaw Thein, the deputy chief of OCMI (Kyaw Win) has 
subsequently shouldered much of the burden for managing the 
day to day operations of the SPDC\'s vast military 
intelligence apparatus.  Meanwhile, Kyaw Thein and several 
other officers have taken on responsibility for managing many 
of the regime\'s relations with Burma\'s ethnics, including the 
coddling of cease-fire groups and courting of insurgent 
hold-outs. 
 
6. (C) BGen Kyaw Thein, who indicated that he relished the 
opportunity to spend ten days in the field and away from the 
burdens of his office, said that under the direction of PM 
Khin Nyunt, life for senior OCMI officials had become \"the 
road map, all day and every day.\"  Khin Nyunt is keen to 
implement initial steps in the road map plan as early as 
possible and, particularly for Kyaw Thein, oversight of 
counternarcotics activities had become a secondary priority 
in recent months. 
 
A Convention Cast of Thousands? 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Kyaw Thein offered his view that despite the 
full-court press on implementing the road map, reconvening 
the National Convention would not take place before at least 
the end of June.  He said the regime was finding it a 
challenge to accommodate all of the ethnic groups, 
particularly those who had reached cease-fire arrangements 
with the SPDC since the last ill-fated National Convention, 
which lasted from 1993 until 1996 (Note: approximately 15 
armed ethnic opposition groups and splinter organizations 
have made peace with the SPDC since 1993.  End note).  The 
SPDC, said Kyaw Thein, anticipated a vast increase in the 
number of delegates participating in a new Convention, 
perhaps as many as double or triple the 700-plus who 
participated in 1993. 
 
8. (C) Regarding discussions involving a National Convention 
and a new constitution, Kyaw Thein said the regime had to 
approach each ethnic organization as a unique entity, as 
every ethnic grouping had its own distinct \"personality\" and 
identity.  As an example, he noted that during the peak of 
insurgent conflicts in the 1980s, the Burmese Army 
categorized the major armed ethnic groups by their favored 
battle tactics:  the Wa preferred full frontal assaults, the 
Karen favored ambushes, the Kachin used snipers, and the Chin 
were well know for digging in and holding solid defensive 
positions. 
 
Friends, Former Foes, and Those In Between 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9. (C) During our opium survey travels, we encountered 
numerous cease-fire groups and observed Kyaw Thein take a 
slightly different approach with each.  He was clearly most 
at ease with the so-called \"vassal\" groups, ethnic entities 
which were among the first to cut mutually beneficial deals 
with the SPDC in the late 1980s and early 1990s such as the 
Pa-O National Organization (Special Region 6), the Kokang 
(Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army-MNDAA, Special 
Regional 1), and the Kachin Defense Army-KDA (Special Region 
5).  Kyaw Thein was also at home among the residents of a 
unique tri-village region known as \"Lon-Htan\" in northern 
Shan State, where locals gave early support to the Burmese 
Army against the Burmese Communist Party and were rewarded 
with limited autonomy, including the right to run their own 
people\'s militia. 
 
10. (C) Kyaw Thein\'s relations were less relaxed with the 
more aggressive leaders of the Shan State Army-SSA (Special 
Region 3) and the United Wa State Army-UWSA (Special Region 
2).  These cease-fire groups occupy the largest of Burma\'s 
dozen-plus special regions and arguably have the greatest 
autonomy.  However, in exchange for self-rule, many observers 
believe these regions have received little in terms of 
assistance from the GOB and consequently continue to tolerate 
and \"tax\" the drug business as a means of procuring 
development funds.  Kyaw Thein\'s last field command, before 
his promotion to HQ positions in Rangoon, was on the front 
lines against the UWSA. 
 
It\'s My Poppy and I\'ll Grow If I Want To 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) We visited several Shan and Wa villages where local 
leaders were particularly defiant about their poppy 
livelihoods.  In one Shan village under SSA control, farmers 
said they had no knowledge of the illegality of growing poppy 
and declared that they would continue to produce opium for 
the foreseeable future as their only source of supplemental 
cash income.  Kyaw Thein conceded that in many parts of Shan 
State fully under central authority, the GOB had low 
expectations for weaning \"hold out\" farmers off of poppy and 
did not expect substantial progress until the GOB\'s goal of 
becoming poppy-free in 2014. 
 
12. (C) Wa territory is a different story, however.  UWSA 
authorities have declared a deadline of 2005 for ceasing the 
cultivation of poppy, but not all Wa villages are on board 
with this objective and several local leaders took advantage 
of Kyaw Thein\'s presence, as well as the rest of our joint 
survey team, to declare their own intentions. 
 
13. (C) One example of local Wa defiance was the village of 
Yaung Luhk, located in close proximity to the border with 
China, where the entire population of 113 families cultivates 
poppy and farmers fetch over $300 per kilo of opium, almost 
three times the average market price in the interior of Shan 
State.  The local UWSA chairman belligerently declared to 
Kyaw Thein, in our presence, that he and his villagers were 
fully aware of the 2005 deadline but had no intention of 
stopping poppy cultivation unless the Burmese and the 
international community provided them with cash assistance. 
In another Wa village we met up with Pao Yu Lian, younger 
brother of UWSA Chairman Pao Yu Xiang, who encouraged local 
leaders to press General Kyaw Thein for assistance in 
exchange for ceasing poppy cultivation. 
 
Comment: An Uneasy Peace 
------------------------ 
 
14. (C)  The GOB has, since the augmentation of our bilateral 
sanctions in July 2003, instituted a de facto 
non-fraternization policy that prohibits most Burmese 
military and civilian officials from unauthorized contact 
with U.S. diplomats.  Spending ten days in remote Shan State 
with Brigadier General Kyaw Thein was a rare opportunity to 
observe a senior military officer interact with foreign 
diplomats, subordinates, local officials, and especially 
diverse ethnic groups.  Although he enjoyed the basic perks 
of a one-star general, he was friendly and professional with 
the ethnic groups and we did not see him exact a \"visit tax\" 
like other senior officials we have observed in the field 
(reftel). 
 
15. (C) We took particular note in the hearty laughs he 
shared with leaders of ethnic groups in the SPDC camp, 
including a friendly exchange with KDA officials who pitched 
him on revisiting the terms of their 1991 cease-fire 
agreement to broaden their share of jade mining concessions. 
As for relations with the Wa, it has been 15 years since the 
UWSA reached a cease-fire with the GOB.  However, it was 
abundantly clear during our survey that, at best, an uneasy 
peace exists between the two sides and Kyaw Thein was merely 
a guest while in Wa territory.  He appeared embarrassed by 
our encounters with defiant Wa poppy growers, and privately 
acknowledged that UWSA authorities will have a difficult time 
meeting their 2005 poppy-free deadline.  End Comment.

1.  Summary:  Members of the National Convention Convening 
Work Committee demonstrate scant appreciation for the guiding 
principles and mechanics of constitution drafting.  There is 
no indication the planned drafting process will involve 
genuine dialogue, negotiation, debate, or collaboration.  By 
all appearances, the SPDC and their proxies on the Work 
Committee, and not the delegates to a reconvened National 
Convention, will unilaterally address fundamental issues such 
as separation of powers, state and local authority, and 
individual rights.  The role of a reconvened National 
Convention, it appears, will be to simply bless the finished 
product, one that ensures a preeminent governing role for the 
military.  End Summary. 
 
2. On March 25, Emboffs and a PD-sponsored speaker, a senior 
U.S. judge, met with three members of the National 
Convention\'s \"Convening Work Committee.\"  The committee is a 
35-member group of senior GOB officials, appointed by SPDC 
Chairman Senior General Than Shwe in October 2003, that has 
the nominal task of preparing draft constitutional language 
for a reconvened National Convention.  Chief Justice U Aung 
Toe chairs the committee and at least seven deputy ministers 
are among its members. 
 
3. Our interlocutors from the Convening Work Committee were 
committee secretary U Thaung Nyunt and members Dr. Tun Shin 
(Deputy Attorney General) and Dr. Thaung Nyunt (Ministry of 
Health advisor).  Thaung Nyunt described the committee\'s 
objective as \"formulating and approving the basic principles 
for a new constitution.\"  He said that potential delegates to 
a reconvened National Convention will be allowed to make 
proposals on the draft constitution, but that the Work 
Committee \"will give them the facts,\" implying that any 
proposal would have to fit a pre-determined framework 
determined by the SPDC. 
 
4. According to the Work Committee members, the GOB intends 
to use the 1993-1996 National Convention, which collapsed 
with inconclusive results, as the starting point for the 
drafting of a new constitution and the reconvening of a new 
Convention.  The National Convention initially had 702 
delegates and, according to Thaung Nyunt, \"suffered a number 
of casualties\" and concluded with only 543 delegates. (Note: 
A number of political parties, including the NLD, and ethnic 
groups withdrew in protest over a lack of democratic 
practices in drafting a new constitution and were 
subsequently banned from the Convention.  End Note) 
 
5. The Work Committee members said that the 1993-1996 
National Convention had already identified chapter headings 
and 104 \"fundamental principles\" for a new constitution. 
Furthermore, of the 15 chapters, the suspended Convention had 
already completed work on the \"detailed basic principles\" of 
the first six, including the State fundamental principles, 
the State structure, the Head of State, the Legislature, the 
Executive, and the Judiciary.  A reconvened National 
Convention, the members said, would not make any changes to 
the chapter headings, to the \"progress achieved\" on the first 
six chapters, or to the 104 principles. 
 
6. The task of a new Convention, Thaung Nyunt intimated, 
would be simply to sign off on the final nine chapters and on 
the overall constitution.  There will be no voting at the 
reconvened National Convention, he said, \"Our job is to avoid 
the disintegration of the Union and our objective is to reach 
a consensus within the Convention.\"  Thaung Nyunt declared 
that the Convention \"will be a success, because we have made 
a considerable effort.\"   On timing, he would only say that 
an announcement on the reconvening of the National Convention 
would take place \"in the very near future.\" 
 
7. We pressed the Work Committee members to describe steps 
the GOB has taken to address the shortcomings of the 
1993-1996 National Convention, which failed to produce a new 
constitution.  \"Res ipso locutor,\" said the Deputy Attorney 
General, \"things speak for themselves and you will see the 
results soon.\"  We also asked if the Committee had reviewed 
existing constitutions to draw on the experience of other 
countries.  Thaung Nyunt said that the GOB is not ignoring 
other constitutions, but declined to identify any models or 
examples. 
 
Comment: Just Sign On the Dotted Line 
 
8. Many potential delegates to a reconvened National 
Convention have held out hope that the SPDC\'s \"road map to 
democracy\" may actually create opportunities for genuine 
dialogue, negotiation, debate, and collaboration in crafting 
a new constitution that addresses fundamental issues such as 
separation of powers, state and local authority, and 
individual rights.  Our conversation with members of the 
Convening Work Committee, which reports directly to SPDC 
leaders, revealed no consideration for such a process. 
9. Key details of several constitutional issues not fully 
addressed in 1993-1996 are still unresolved, including the 
role of the Armed Forces, elections, and the rights and 
duties of the citizenry.  However, the Work Committee views 
the basic principles that address these issues as set in 
stone, including language that states the Tatmadaw (Armed 
Forces) \"has the right to independently administer all 
affairs concerning the forces\" and \"has the right to take 
over and exercise State power\" in any undefined emergency 
that \"could cause disintegration of the Union.\"  A reconvened 
National Convention, it appears, will be expected to bless a 
constitution that ensures a preeminent governing role for the 
military.

1. (C) Summary:  On March 27, the SPDC celebrated the 59th 
Anniversary of Armed Forces Day with a traditional military 
parade, sundry speeches lauding the accomplishments of the 
modern Burmese Army, and an official state dinner complete 
with a now-standard depiction of Senior General Than Shwe as 
a heroic Burmese king.  There were no reports of security 
incidents and the day passed quietly.  Meanwhile, the 
political opposition, absent Aung San Suu Kyi and others who 
remain under house arrest, held parallel commemorative events 
attended by several hundred supporters who honored Burma\'s 
resistance fighters and founders of the independence 
movement.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The SPDC celebrated on March 27 what is perhaps its 
most significant holiday of the year, Armed Forces Day.  The 
day was originally known as \"Resistance Day\" and commemorated 
Aung San\'s decision to throw Burmese Army support behind 
international forces allied against the Japanese.  Ne Win 
changed the name in 1962 to \"Revolutionary Day,\" but the 
holiday has been referred to as Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) Day 
since implementation of the 1974 constitution.  The SPDC 
makes only passing reference to the historical origins of the 
holiday and now uses the occasion to glorify the exploits of 
the Burmese Army and to re-emphasize the necessity of 
military control as a means of ensuring national unity. 
 
3. (U) This year\'s military parade was standard fare: 
thousands of well-drilled troops on display for regime 
leaders and invited guests, including foreign military 
attaches.  Senior General Than Shwe made brief remarks and, 
in a thinly veiled threat directed at the democratic 
opposition and their supporters, called on his \"comrades\" to 
\"repulse courageously whatever dangers that threaten the 
nation.\"   He made no reference to the SPDC\'s road map, but 
gave the regime\'s generic defense of its 1988 coup, stating 
that \"the Tatmadaw was compelled to assume the 
responsibilities of the State as the people were faced with a 
generally deteriorating and extremely critical situation.\" 
Unlike last year\'s celebrations, marked by several bombings, 
the day passed quietly and reportedly without incident (ref 
C). 
 
4. (C) The SPDC\'s Big Three (Than Shwe, Maung Aye, and Khin 
Nyunt) appeared to be in good shape and high spirits at an 
official dinner held at the military\'s HQ complex in northern 
Rangoon.  Than Shwe chatted extensively with a visiting 
Japanese veteran, Shigemoto Okuda, who had trained Aung San, 
Ne Win, and the other \"Thirty Comrades\" early in WWII.  When 
the DCM commented to Than Shwe on cooperation experienced 
during a recently concluded WWII remains recovery operation, 
the Senior General did not wait for the translator to 
interpret, but replied, \"Yes, I am glad to hear that.\"  Maung 
Aye, absent during the military parade earlier in the day and 
rumored by some to be ill, seemed relaxed, had a firm 
handshake, walked briskly, and otherwise looked hale. 
 
5. (SBU) Besides some members of the diplomatic and defense 
attach corps, the official dinner included several hundred 
senior members of the military, government, and the Union 
Solidarity and Development Association (USDA).  After a 
hurried dinner, the guests were \"treated\" to the SPDC\'s 
standard after-dinner cultural fare, including the 
now-obligatory video transformation of an image of an early 
heroic Burmese king into the smiling visage of Senior General 
Than Shwe. 
 
6. (C) As on recent holidays (refs A and B), the democratic 
opposition held several parallel commemorative events.  The 
NLD honored 63 surviving war veterans who had served under 
General Aung San during WWII and the subsequent independence 
movement, and issued a five-page statement that called for 
national reconciliation and a transition to democracy. 
Several hundred party members, supporters, and U.S. Embassy 
officers attended the event, which was held at unofficial 
party headquarters (the modest Rangoon house of CEC member 
Than Tun).  Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD\'s other top leaders, 
in attendance at a similar event last year, remain under 
house arrest. 
 
7. (SBU) Later in the day, the Veteran Politicians hosted a 
dinner to celebrate Burma\'s resistance movement.  Several 
hundred veterans, NLD and other opposition party members and 
leaders, and representatives of the democratic ethnic groups 
(UNLD, UNA) attended the subdued affair.  As during the NLD 
event earlier in the day, U.S. Embassy officers were the only 
members of the diplomatic community in attendance.  Military 
intelligence (MI) agents were on the scene and organizers 
reported no unusual harassment or intimidation, although MI 
officers had earlier in the week warned the NLD not to hold 
Resistance (Armed Forces) Day events as they would 
\"jeopardize talks between the SPDC and the NLD.\" 
 
8. (C) Comment:  We asked several of the elderly veterans who 
attended political opposition events, decked out in their 
medals honoring bravery and military service, if they had 
attended any of the SPDC\'s official functions.  They chuckled 
and said that in order for veterans and other national heroes 
to attend the Armed Forces Day parade, they must submit 
applications weeks ahead of time requesting invitations.  In 
the words of one NLD leader, \"The Tatmadaw has attempted to 
hijack our holiday; however, as we celebrate \"Resistance Day\" 
we honor not only our past, but our present as well.\"

Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D). 
 
1. (C) In a March 24 conversation, the Russian ambassador in 
Rangoon, Oleg Kabanov, told the COM that he had met with the 
Burmese Minister of Science and Technology, U Thaung, on 
March 23 and discussed the status of the proposed 
Burmese-Russian nuclear reactor project that has been hanging 
fire, according to Kabanov, \"for at least four years.\" 
Kabanov said that he asked the Minister if the GOB intended 
to proceed with the nuclear project or to cancel it 
completely as there has been no formal agreement signed 
between Burma and Russia nor has there been any indication 
that the GOB has any fiscal resources to dedicate to the 
project.  Kabanov said the Minister assured him that the GOB 
did not want to cancel the project although there was 
currently no funding for it. 
 
2. (C) Kabanov said that it was apparent to him that the GOB 
had never fully understood the commitment, in terms of time, 
money and personnel resources, required for the project.  He 
said that someone \"probably gave the idea to Senior General 
Than Shwe and he liked it because having a reactor would give 
the country international prestige\" but now no one wanted to 
tell the Senior General that the idea should be abandoned as 
it would be a case of \"kill the messenger.\" 
 
3. (C) Kabanov said that he had never seen any progress on 
the project in his two and a half years in Rangoon, and did 
not expect to see any during his tenure.  He said that in any 
case, the Russian government would insist on Burmese nuclear 
technicians working under Russian supervision and in 
accordance with IAEA standards for such a project.  According 
to Kabanov, the GOB wants a reactor to produce isotopes for 
medical and agricultural purposes (for irradiating seeds to 
increase yield). 
 
4. (C) Kabanov also said that there were about 1,000 Burmese 
studying in Russia, in a wide variety of fields.  Some are 
studying nuclear technology, but the majority are scattered 
among a variety of disciplines. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  This conversation with Kabanov reiterated 
what he has said previously regarding Russia - Burma nuclear 
cooperation.  He remains consistent and insistent in his 
statements that the GOR considers the issue stalled for now 
and for the near future.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  Indonesian Ambassador to Burma, Wyoso 
Prodjowarsito, revealed on March 31 that Presidential Advisor 
Ali Alatas may revisit Burma o/a April 17, although that date 
could slip due to the concurrent Burmese New Year. 
Prodjowarsito portrayed Indonesia as a close friend of Burma 
and suggested that Alatas would offer the regime \"help and 
advice.\"  Alatas, as during his most recent visit in 2003, 
will not make a meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi \"a top 
priority.\"  Prodjowarsito\'s preview gives us the impression 
that Alatas does not intend to depart from his soft approach 
toward the Burmese regime.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On March 31 COM and P/E Chief called on Indonesian 
Ambassador to Burma, Wyoso Prodjowarsito, and learned that 
Indonesia had yet to receive an invitation to the second 
Bangkok meeting on Burma, scheduled for April 30 (ref B). 
However, Prodjowarsito had recently met with the Burmese 
Deputy FM and expected an invitation imminently. 
Prodjowarsito offered his own view that the first Bangkok 
meeting, held last December, was helpful in that the GOB had 
agreed to attend and sent FM Win Aung as its envoy.  However, 
Prodjowarsito said, the GOB had provided no new information 
at the first session and expectations would be higher for 
something concrete at the upcoming meeting. 
 
3. (C) Prodjowarsito said that Indonesian Presidential 
Advisor Ali Alatas was scheduled to arrive in Burma o/a April 
17, but noted that this date fell on Burmese New Year and 
could slip due to the related water festival, which 
effectively shuts the GOB down April 12-17.  According to 
Prodjowarsito, \"Indonesia is a close friend of Myanmar; 
Alatas will visit at the invitation of the GOB and he will 
offer the Burmese whatever help and advice we can.\" 
Prodjowarsito said that when Alatas made his most recent 
visit to Burma in September 2003 (ref C) he had met with SPDC 
Chairman Than Shwe and Prime Minister Khin Nyunt, meetings he 
would likely pursue again.  \"However,\" the Ambassador added, 
\"it has never been Alatas\' top priority to see Aung San Suu 
Kyi and he will not pursue that opportunity unless she asks 
for it.\" 
 
4. (C) Prodjowarsito told the COM that the U.S. should not 
pressure the SPDC.  \"You have to be patient,\" he said, \"and 
you need to lift sanctions in order to give the GOB some room 
to breath.\"  COM replied that the regime was responsible for 
its own predicament and stated that there are numerous steps 
(e.g. the release of ASSK and the rest of the NLD leadership; 
the release of 1,300 political prisoners; etc.) that the SPDC 
could take to improve its standing with the international 
community.  The COM referred to a statement the GOB had 
issued on March 28, critical of recent U.S. Congressional 
testimony on Burma, that complained no country can transform 
itself into a democracy \"overnight.\"  The COM observed that 
the military had seized power in 1962 and said, \"Forty two 
years hardly qualifies as \"overnight.\" 
 
5. (C) Comment:  The Indonesian Ambassador in Rangoon is not 
a major player and he seemed somewhat uninformed about recent 
Burma developments.  He does, however, get more deeply 
involved when Alatas is in town.  According to Ambassador 
Prodjowarsito, Alatas operates independently from UN Special 
Envoy Razali as well as from the Bangkok process.  Although 
separate reporting (ref A and previous) indicates that Alatas 
does in fact coordinate with others on Burma, we did not get 
the impression from this meeting that the Indonesian 
Presidential Advisor intends to depart from the \"soft\" 
approach he took during his previous visit.  End Comment.

2.  (C) A Rangoon-based Arakan (Rakhine) politician and two 
Arakan Muslim leaders told us April 9 that they expect a 
severe reaction against Muslims in Arakan State sooner or 
later, following the attack on the Burmese Embassy in Kuala 
Lumpur by several Arakan Muslim refugees on April 7.  They 
fear the GOB, which already represses the Muslim population, 
will further restrict National Registration Card issuance, 
passport issuance, domestic travel, and property ownership. 
The Arakanese Muslim clerics will instruct followers during 
Friday prayers to take precautionary measures when dealing 
with the authorities. 
 
3.  (C) The Arakan leaders all agreed the motive of attack 
was personal, not political, gang, or terrorist related -- 
evidenced by the home-made weapons used in the attack.  If 
they had been terrorists, our interlocutors pointed out, the 
attackers would have done much more damage.  The Muslim 
Arakan leaders said the attackers were not related to 
al-Qaida, and they felt that \"al-Qaida will not target 
Burmese interests overseas because they (al-Qaida) won\'t get 
any profit from destroying Burmese properties.\" 
 
UNHCR ALSO EXPECTS TROUBLE 
 
4.  (C) The UNHCR Representative to Burma, Rajiv Kapur, 
related to the COM April 8 that the MOFA Director General for 
International Organizations had convoked him to demand an 
explanation for a UNHCR letter allegedly found on the 
attackers identifying them as \"Rohingya Muslims from 
Myanmar.\"  Kapur told the DG that when UNHCR in Malaysia 
denies refugee status to a Muslim from northern Arakan State, 
UNHCR issues them a a rejection letter simply identifying 
them as such.  Kapur expects there will be negative 
consequences for the Muslims in Arakan State, but as yet, 
UNHCR officers and NGO partners have not detected any 
incidents. 
 
THE TWO-TIME LOSER 
 
5.  (C) GOB contacts told us today that the Burmese 
Ambassador to KL is none other than U Hla Maung, who was also 
the Burmese Ambassador to Thailand in 1999 when former 
Burmese students raided and occupied the Burmese Embassy.  U 
Hla Maung was formerly commander of a special OCMI unit 
responsible for handling Political Detentions, 
Interrogations, and Security Affairs for GOB VIPs. 
 
5.  (C) COMMENT:  That the GOB treats overseas Arakan Muslims 
with contempt is no surprise, considering the GOB\'s 
restrictive policies against the Bengali-speaking Muslims in 
northern Arakan State (ref B).  However, it is noteworthy 
that, just before the biggest Burmese Buddhist holiday of the 
year when latent inter-religious tensions could suddenly 
flare, the GOB in its press release avoided inflaming 
tensions by not mentioning the ethnicity or religion of the 
attackers.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) Summary:  Our recent calls on six Rangoon-based EU and 
ASEAN diplomatic missions to discuss the second meeting of 
the \"Bangkok Process\" on Burma revealed a range of 
assessments on the road that lies ahead.  Most of the 
missions believe that the SPDC will release ASSK within days 
or weeks and they almost uniformly view the Bangkok Process 
as a helpful mechanism to achieving forward movement.  To the 
contrary, we see every sign that the SPDC has agreed to 
participate in Bangkok as a means to pacify the international 
community.  The generals intend, as always, to go where they 
want, how they want, and when they want.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) April 7-8 COM and P/E Chief called on a half dozen 
available EU and ASEAN Ambassadors (and one Charge) to 
discuss recent political developments and to gain insight 
into the upcoming Bangkok meeting on Burma on April 30.  Key 
highlights follow in paras 3-7. 
 
3. (C) The British: 
 
-- Ambassador Vicky Bowman said that the RTG had not issued 
an invitation to the UK to attend the Bangkok meeting nor had 
the UK requested one.  \"However,\" she added, \"we would go if 
invited,\" noting that Foreign Secretary O\'Brien was keen to 
use any opportunity to press the GOB on the need to make 
forward movement.  In the interim, the UK is helping to push 
for the EU to get a seat at the table. 
 
-- Bowman expressed her strong \"gut feeling\" that the SPDC 
will allow ASSK to meet with the entire NLD CEC o/a April 15 
and then release her from house arrest a day or two later. 
She cited a number of factors that lead her to this 
conclusion:  UN Special Envoy Razali\'s assessment that ASSK 
will be released o/a April 17; pressure from the Thai and 
other ASEAN countries; the upcoming ASEM meeting on April 
17-18, the success of which hinges in part on progress in 
Burma (on the latter point, Bowman said that the Japanese 
have been telling the ASEAN countries that the EU \"will 
crumble\" and let Burma participate in ASEM). 
 
-- Bowman said her Home Office has prepared a draft statement 
should ASSK be released within the next week or so.  In that 
statement, the UK would welcome ASSK\'s freedom and note that 
their Ambassador in Rangoon \"intends to see her as soon as 
possible.\"  We noted our doubts about ASSK\'s imminent 
release, but agreed that contingency language was sensible, 
given that Rangoon will shut down for water festival April 
12-16.  However, we advised that it might be more helpful to 
note that the British Ambassador \"hopes\" to see ASSK, given 
that ASSK\'s intentions are unknown.  We also noted that if 
Washington issued a statement upon her release, the USG would 
also likely call for the reopening of NLD offices. 
 
4. (C) The Germans: 
 
-- Charge d\'affaires Christoph Retzlaff said that an MFA Asia 
Director (A/S equivalent) would represent Germany at the 
Bangkok II meeting.  He said that new participants for the 
next round include Norway, Switzerland, Bangladesh, Laos, and 
Malaysia.  He added that the EU wants an invitation, but the 
Thai are being \"cautious.\" 
 
-- Retzlaff said that Germany had no illusions about the 
value of the Bangkok Process, observing that it was not a 
decision-making mechanism and Burmese FM Win Aung had no 
mandate from the SPDC to negotiate.  However, he said, it is 
a positive development that the GOB actually agrees to 
discuss internal matters and, in turn, may be \"influenced 
when exposed to the international community.\" 
 
-- Retzlaff observed that it is very clear that the entire 
road map process depends on the participation of the NLD. 
The SPDC may now be in a \"comfortable\" position, having 
announced the reconvening of the National Convention, but the 
regime will lose all credibility if the process is not open 
and inclusive. 
 
-- According to Retzlaff, the German Embassy recently took 
the lead on an EU joint demarche on the GOB which provided 
suggestions for a successful National Convention and urged 
the adoption of democratic procedures in drafting a new 
constitution.  \"The problem,\" he said, \"is that these guys 
don\'t react to the outside world.\" 
 
5. (C) The French: 
 
-- Ambassador Jean-Michel Lacombe said that the Quai\'s Asia 
Director (A/S equivalent) will represent France at Bangkok 
II, but will first travel to Rangoon to \"see as many people 
as he can.\"  France, said Lacombe, wants to give the Bangkok 
Process a chance to work. 
 
-- Lacombe said he believed ASSK would soon be released and 
opined that the GOB would not have announced the reconvening 
of the National Convention \"without some understanding with 
her.\"  We observed that the regime had likely made the 
surprise announcement to reconvene at an earlier date than 
expected simply to be in a position to bring a \"deliverable\" 
to the Bangkok meeting. 
 
-- Lacombe added that he felt enhancing EU sanctions would be 
counterproductive and described such action as \"more for 
domestic consumption in Europe\" than for having an impact in 
Burma where the GOB has ample economic support from 
neighboring countries. 
 
6. (C) The Italians 
 
--  Italy plans to \"downgrade\" their participation at Bangkok 
II from Deputy Foreign Minister to the Asia Director level. 
Ambassador Raffaele Miniero said that Italy would advocate a 
carrot and stick approach to the SPDC.  \"We must be careful 
and not say the road map is rubbish,\" Miniero said.  \"We 
didn\'t react when the regime released ASSK in 2002 and they 
failed to continue forward progress.\" 
 
-- In this regard, Miniero said, Italy was prepared to 
discuss at Bangkok II possible assistance to Burma if the 
regime takes appropriate steps.  COM replied that simply 
reconvening the National Convention should not be the only 
measure of progress; the regime must release ASSK and other 
NLD leaders and allow full participation and transparency in 
the drafting of a new constitution. 
 
-- Miniero said he recently met with Burmese Deputy Foreign 
Minister U Kyaw Thu and told the DFM that the GOB needed to 
have ASSK and the NLD on board in order to have a successful 
road map process.  The DFM responded, \"Don\'t expect too 
much.\"  Miniero concluded that the GOB is not worried about 
the National Convention process, but has greater concerns 
about national elections and how some among the international 
community will respond.  He added that the GOB only wants to 
do something that is acceptable to ASEAN, especially in time 
to host the ASEAN Summit in 2006, and doesn\'t care about the 
West. 
 
7. (C) The Lao and the Cambodians: 
 
-- Lao Ambassador Chanthavy Bodhisane said that Laos would 
join Bangkok II \"to gain understanding about how the process 
is unfolding.\"  He said he had no confirmation from Vientiane 
that the GOL had accepted an invitation from the RTG, but 
said that Laos would participate as recognition of \"growing 
Lao-Thai cooperation.\" 
 
-- We inquired if Laos intended to approach the Burmese 
pro-democracy opposition to gain their perspective before 
Bangkok II.  Bodhisane replied, \"No way.\" 
 
-- Cambodian Ambassador Hul Phany said he had read in Bangkok 
papers that Cambodia would be invited to Bangkok II.  \"We 
would go if invited,\" he said, \"but we have received no 
invitation.\" 
 
-- Phany said that a National Convention without ASSK and the 
NLD \"would not be interesting.\"  He said that all political 
parties must be allowed to participate and he expressed hope 
that negotiations would lead to a new constitution. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  If the Rangoon missions are any indication, 
EU governments will use Bangkok II as an opportunity to 
gently prod the GOB in the right direction, while the ASEAN 
governments are prepared to accept the minimal steps taken 
thus far as sufficient evidence the GOB is already on the 
right track.  Both approaches are premised in part on the 
assumption that SPDC leaders accept that the Bangkok Process 
will provide sign posts that they need to follow on their 
road map to democracy.  To the contrary, we see every sign 
that the SPDC has agreed to participate in Bangkok as a means 
to pacify the international community.  They intend, as 
always, to go where they want, how they want, and when they 
want.  End Comment.

1. (S) Summary:  During our April 19 visit to re-opened NLD 
headquarters, recently released Chairman U Aung Shwe played 
down press reports that he believes ASSK\'s release is 
imminent and denied rumors of a meeting between top SPDC and 
NLD leaders, but acknowledged that the regime had allowed him 
and other detained CEC members to meet with ASSK in 
mid-March.  The released NLD leaders told us they believe 
their party has some leverage vis-a-vis the regime\'s 
reconvening of the National Convention, but that they will 
wait and see what develops in the coming weeks.  The release 
of U Aung Shwe and NLD Secretary U Lwin, and the reopening of 
party headquarters, has given the party a visible morale 
boost, but the pro-democracy movement will remain hobbled 
until the release of ASSK and U Tin Oo and the re-opening of 
all NLD party offices.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On April 19, COM and P/E Chief called on NLD 
Chairman U Aung Shwe and Secretary U Lwin, both released on 
April 13 after spending over ten months under house arrest. 
We met at NLD headquarters in central Rangoon, re-opened on 
April 17, where about a hundred NLD party members were busy 
cleaning musty offices and fielding questions from 
international media stringers.  NLD CEC member U Nyunt Wei, 
released last November, also joined the one-hour meeting. 
 
3. (C) U Aung Shwe, quoted earlier in the day in 
international press reports as expecting the release of Aung 
San Suu Kyi \"within one or two days,\" told us with a smile 
that he had no specific information regarding ASSK\'s status, 
but said that he and his colleagues remained \"ever hopeful\" 
that she and NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo would be released 
soon. 
 
4. (S) We asked the NLD leaders about fresh rumors that the 
detained NLD top leadership (ASSK, U Tin Oo, U Aung Shwe, and 
U Lwin) had met in March with SPDC Chairman Than Shwe, PM 
General Khin Nyunt, and other top regime leaders.  U Aung 
Shwe acknowledged that the four NLD party leaders held a 
brief meeting among themselves to discuss party business in 
mid-March, but denied that there had been any contact with 
the SPDC generals.  He demurred on discussing the content of 
the NLD meeting or identifying the location, describing their 
talks as \"secret,\" and said he had no idea why the SPDC had 
allowed the detained party leaders an opportunity to meet. 
 
5. (C) The CEC members agreed with COM\'s observation that the 
SPDC had issued invitations to some NLD members to attend the 
reconvened National Convention to give the regime at least a 
limited ability to claim it was being \"inclusive\" and blame 
the NLD for a failed process should the leading opposition 
party choose to boycott.  U Lwin said that in 1995, after his 
party departed the Convention, the regime stated that it 
\"could do anything without the NLD.\"  In reality, he added, 
they were unable to move ahead without the NLD and the 
Convention collapsed shortly thereafter.  \"We have some 
leverage,\" said U Aung Shwe, \"but we will wait and see what 
develops in the coming weeks.\" 
 
6. (C) The NLD leaders said that they believed about 30 NLD 
members had received direct invitations to attend the 
reconvened Convention.  (Note: The NLD was allotted 86 
delegates to the 1993 Convention, plus an additional five 
party representatives. End Note)  They said no NLD member 
would act on their invitation (and U Aung Shwe said he had 
even refused to take receipt of his invitation from a 
military intelligence courier), but allowed that the regime 
might be able to persuade four former NLD party members, 
dismissed by party leaders, to attend the Convention under 
the NLD banner. 
 
7. (C) U Lwin said that the NLD insists that the SPDC address 
the significant shortcomings of the aborted 1993-1996 
National Convention before giving serious consideration to 
participating in a renewed Convention.  U Nyunt Wei added 
that the Burmese people would not blame the NLD for a stalled 
process.  \"Our people won\'t be duped,\" he said \"the generals 
are obviously moving toward a constitutional dictatorship and 
their road map is nonsense and nothing more than eyewash.\" 
8. (C) U Aung Shwe said that U.S. sanctions \"have been very 
helpful\" and U Lwin added that the NLD welcomes recent U.S. 
and EU statements drawing attention to their release and 
other developments regarding the NLD.  \"Our real task now,\" 
added U Nyunt Wei, \"is to counter the propaganda of the 
regime that has Kofi Annan and others in the international 
community, especially Special Envoy Razali, believing that 
the generals are serious about a transition to democracy.\" 
The NLD leaders described the drafting of a new constitution 
as a fait accompli and said they were offended that some 
countries insist the NLD get on the boat or risk missing an 
opportunity to partake in a transition.  \"We don\'t like the 
captain of the boat,\" said U Nyunt Wei, \"and we don\'t like 
the destination.\" 
 
9. (C) Comment:  U Aung Shwe and U Lwin were in very good 
spirits and fully engaged in rejuvenating NLD activities at 
party headquarters.  U Aung Shwe, who at age 86 is the eldest 
of the CEC members, appeared to be in robust health while 80 
year-old U Lwin, who suffered a stroke in the mid-1990s, was 
frail but was deftly handling a spontaneous press conference 
when we arrived.  Although their release, and the opening of 
party headquarters, has given the party a visible boost of 
much needed morale, we suspect that the pro-democracy 
movement will remain hobbled until the release of ASSK and U 
Tin Oo and the re-opening of all party offices.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  Malaysia\'s ambassador to Burma believes that 
the GOB is \"firm\" in wanting to postpone the April 29-30 
Bangkok II meeting in order to avoid \"getting clobbered\" by 
the international community.  Nonetheless, he believes that 
the signs are good ASSK will be released soon and assesses 
that the NLD would be foolish to boycott the National 
Convention.  The Malaysian ambassador, more informed and 
insightful than many of his ASEAN colleagues, gave us the 
impression that Malaysia may use the Bangkok meeting and 
other upcoming venues to press the SPDC to make more 
progress.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On April 19 COM and P/E chief met with Malaysian 
Ambassador Dato Cheah Sam Kip, continuing our round of calls 
on Rangoon missions to discuss recent developments, including 
preparations for a potential second meeting of the \"Bangkok 
Process\" on Burma (ref A). 
 
3. (C) Ambassador Cheah said that Malaysia had not yet 
decided who to send to Bangkok II, scheduled for April 29-30, 
but noted that his Foreign Minister had already received an 
invitation from the Thai Government (RTG).  He expressed 
pleasure that Malaysia had been invited, noting somewhat 
bitterly that neither the RTG nor the GOB had wanted his 
country at the table for the initial meeting in December. 
Cheah, observing that Malaysia had provided strong support 
for Burma\'s effort to join ASEAN, said that the \"SPDC is very 
good at turning its friends into its enemies.\" 
 
4. (C) According to Ambassador Cheah, the GOB has taken a 
firm stance on postponing the Bangkok II meeting.  Despite 
Thai FM Surakiart\'s quick trip to Rangoon on April 10 to 
press the GOB to stick to the meeting as scheduled (ref D), 
the Burmese \"do not want to go to Bangkok and get clobbered, 
which will happen if Aung San Suu Kyi is not released.\" 
Cheah agreed with the COM\'s observation that SPDC Chairman 
Than Shwe was fearful of letting ASSK free to conduct party 
business and the ambassador added that international 
reaction, including that of Malaysia, would be \"very adverse\" 
if the regime did not release her before reconvening the 
National Convention on May 17. 
 
5. (C) Cheah said that in his view the \"signs are good\" that 
ASSK will be released very soon.  He noted that Special Envoy 
Razali was wrapping up a trip to Geneva and hoped to visit 
ASSK \"just after\" her release.  However, if she is not 
released soon, he said, GOB participation in a Bangkok 
meeting would be of no value.  Therefore, Cheah continued, 
absent further progress the Thai should not push to hold the 
meeting as scheduled.  He added that the regime shows no 
desire to take on board suggestions from the international 
community and merely \"tolerates\" the visits of (Special 
Envoy) Razali and (Special Rapporteur) Pinheiro. 
 
6. (C) Ambassador Cheah said it would be \"foolhardy\" of the 
NLD to boycott the Convention process.  \"They absolutely must 
participate,\" he added, \"and we will give ASSK that message.\" 
 (Note: NLD CEC members told us later in the day that they 
are \"offended\" that some countries insist the party must 
partake in a process designed to rubber stamp a constitution 
that is already drafted (ref B).  End Note) 
 
7. (C) Comment:  Although we continue to have doubts about 
\"signs\" that ASSK\'s release is imminent, Ambassador Cheah was 
decidedly more informed and insightful than many of his ASEAN 
colleagues in Rangoon (ref A).  He noted with delight that 
former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir had in recent days 
apparently expressed disappointment with the pace of 
democratization in Burma and had expressed \"regret\" over 
bringing the country into ASEAN.  Although available press 
reports indicate that Mahathir was more circumspect in his 
public remarks, Cheah intimated that Malaysia may seek to use 
Bangkok II or other upcoming venues to press the SPDC to make 
the National Convention and constitution drafting an 
inclusive and more open process.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: A recent joint visit by Bangkok and Rangoon 
Econoffs to Ranong and Kawthaung, along the southern 
Burmese-Thai border, shows business as usual in the informal 
movement of goods and people.  However, the formal economy on 
both sides is sluggish due to the continued ban on Thai 
fishing in Burmese waters and the Burmese government\'s 
perpetually capricious economic policies.  For Kawthaung 
(Burma), economic activity from the southern border trade 
continues to provide critically needed goods, and the border 
crossing remains an important outlet for workers from the 
interior seeking better economic opportunities in Thailand 
and Malaysia.  In Ranong (Thailand), locals are giving up on 
Burma and looking regionally for their economic future.  End 
summary. 
 
Waiting for Fish: Ranong 
 
2. (U) To assess the current environment along the Thai-Burma 
border, Bangkok and Rangoon Econoffs traveled March 15-19 to 
two major border trade points -- Ranong (Thailand) and 
Kawthaung (Burma) and Mae Sot (Thailand) and Myawaddy (Burma; 
septel).  Separated by a wide river mouth on the Andaman Sea, 
Ranong and Kawthaung are tied together by the fishing 
industry and modest amounts of legal and illegal trade. 
According to Ranong Fisheries Association sources, more than 
2,000 fishing boats (of various sizes) call Ranong home 
despite the fact that rich Burmese territorial waters have 
been off-limits to Thais for several years.  Local 
businesspeople still blame the previous Thai Prime Minister 
Chuan Leekpai whose tough Burma policy led to the Burmese 
regime\'s cut off of Thai access to Burmese waters. Other Thai 
fishing industry sources blame overzealous Thai fishermen for 
decimating Burmese fish stocks in the 1990s, which led to a 
permanent Burmese crackdown. 
 
3. (SBU) Whatever the reason, the fishing ban is slowly 
strangling Ranong\'s once vibrant commercial fishing and 
processing industry.  Local Thai waters are not as rich, and 
severe responses by the Burmese Navy to poaching -- 40 Thai 
boats were seized in 2003 -- discourage poaching in Burmese 
waters.  While a few fish processing plants remain, they buy 
much of their raw materials from Songkhla and other fishing 
grounds to the south to supply the domestic market. 
 
4. (C) Border trade between the two countries is steady, but 
stifling GOB import controls and foreign exchange laws 
prevent it from booming.  This environment keeps traders on 
their toes and requires creativity in sourcing and methods. 
The local Thai Customs chief noted that when the Burmese 
regime closed the border for trade in May 2002, Chinese 
products replaced Thai goods in Kawthaung\'s markets.  Ranong 
Chamber of Commerce officials told us they would never invest 
in Burma because of its unstable business environment, and 
that trade is only possible on a small scale between 
\"friends.\"  A Burmese border trader agreed, saying only a 
small group Burmese businessmen in Kawthaung can thrive on 
trading with Ranong, using small boats to import consumer 
goods and diesel fuel -- usually illegally -- and export 
foodstuffs. 
 
5. (SBU) Ranong\'s business community, and local RTG 
officials, say the future of Ranong is as much or more 
regional than bilateral.  There is a vision of a major 20,000 
ton-per-year port at Ranong that would serve as Bangkok\'s 
access to the Andaman Sea and points west.  There is also 
hope that the touristic development of Burma\'s untouched 
Myeik Archipelago (800 islands lying offshore of Kawthaung 
and north) will be a boon for Ranong\'s hotels, boat 
operators, and tour guides. 
 
Tourism and Palm Oil: Kawthaung 
 
6. (C) In Kawthaung, Burma\'s southernmost point, local 
businesspeople are rather pessimistic about the town\'s 
economic future.  Its proximity to Thailand and Malaysia, and 
the number of small craft that ply the coastal waterways, 
will always ensure its role as a border trading and smuggling 
center and a mustering area for illegal migration to Thailand 
and Malaysia.  However, Kawthaung\'s lack of infrastructure 
and neglect by the GOB will likely retard any major 
development (such as tourism or fisheries). 
 
7. (C) A major GOB campaign underway north of Kawthaung is 
the development of large import-substituting palm oil and 
rubber plantations.  Small businesspeople with whom we spoke 
supported the program, wherein the GOB will give low-interest 
loans and other assistance to set up these farms.  However, 
this will be a crony-dominated program though larger, more 
savvy entrepreneurs admitted they were dubious that the 
government would ultimately prove a reliable consumer, at a 
fair price, of the end product. 
 
Comment: Diverging Priorities 
 
8. (C)  Action along the Ranong-Kawthaung border, while 
relatively sleepy, illustrates several national trends. 
Particularly we saw in action the chilling effect on legal 
commerce of the Burmese regime\'s capricious and often 
punitive policies.  Fortunately for local businesspeople, 
their close historical personal ties allow a continuation of 
trade on the informal level.  However, this is no way to 
sustainably expand cross border economic ties.  Sadly the 
Burmese business community is helpless to improve its lot. 
However local Thai entrepreneurs can and are moving on, 
looking elsewhere for their economic future.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary: A recent visit by Bangkok and Rangoon 
Econoffs to Mae Sot and Myawaddy, the largest trading point 
on the Burmese-Thai border, shows trade volumes that are 
flourishing despite U.S. sanctions and increasingly ludicrous 
Burmese trade policy.  Even more than it does the sleepy 
Kawthaung-Ranong border (ref A), Rangoon relies on Mae Sot as 
a source of daily consumer items as well as more crucial 
industrial inputs -- like diesel.  Coming the other way, more 
than 2500-4000 Burmese a day cross legally into Thailand at 
this border point, with many more crossing illegally across 
the trickle of a river that demarcates the border.  Some come 
as day laborers, others looking for more permanent illegal 
work.  Though the business environment is tough, both Mae Sot 
and Myawaddy businesspeople look forward to a long and 
profitable relationship between the two sides -- whatever it 
takes.  End Summary. 
 
Crossing By Land 
 
2. (U) To assess the current environment along the Thai-Burma 
border, Bangkok and Rangoon Econoffs traveled to two of the 
three major border trade points. The first of these was 
discussed in ref A (septel will look at broader border 
issues).  The second -- Mae Sot, Thailand and Myawaddy, Burma 
-- is 140 miles east of Rangoon and 240 miles northwest of 
Bangkok and is separated only by a trickle of a river.  This 
crossing, the largest by trade volume of the three, has a 
long history of legal and illegal commerce.  The third 
crossing is in northern Thailand at Mae Sai and Tachileik (in 
Burma\'s Shan State). 
 
3. (U) Mae Sot-Myawaddy, joined seven years ago by the 
\"Friendship Bridge,\" is a classic land border crossing with 
trucks stuffed with consumer goods rumbling into Burma\'s 
still somewhat unstable Karen State, toward the Andaman Sea 
coast or Rangoon.  Coming in the other direction are some 
Burmese agricultural products and raw materials and about 
2,500-4,000 Burmese workers -- mostly ethnic Karen, Mon, and 
Burman -- per day.  Many more Burmese likely cross illegally 
into Thailand near Mae Sot across the Moei River. 
 
Trucking to Rangoon: Mae Sot and Myawaddy 
 
4. (U) Unlike the somewhat shaky state of the 
Kawthaung-Ranong dynamic, the Mae Sot and Myawaddy economic 
relationship is extremely vigorous and hugely in Thailand\'s 
favor.  The road west from Myawaddy to Rangoon is still poor, 
running one way on alternating days, and passing through 
regions still controlled by insurgent groups.  It is 
nonetheless the closest border crossing to Rangoon and is 
thus a magnet for exports to Burma -- often illegal -- from 
Mae Sot, elsewhere in Thailand, and from third countries via 
Bangkok.  The Mae Sot Chamber of Commerce estimated that only 
30 percent of goods that cross into Burma at Mae Sot 
originate locally in Tak Province.  These goods are trucked 
to Mae Sot, over the bridge (or across the shallow Moei 
River) into Myawaddy, and then hauled on Burmese vehicles 
onward to Moulmein or Thaton on the Andaman coast or to 
Rangoon. 
 
5. (C) According to Thai Customs and Mae Sot Chamber of 
Commerce numbers, the total trade volume is now about 800 
million baht (USD 20 million) per month with 95 percent of 
that Thai exports.  Official statistics show the trade made 
up of Thai consumer products, vegetable oil, MSG, plastic 
pellets, textiles, construction inputs, and diesel fuel 
trading for Burmese frozen and dried seafood, livestock, 
peanuts, bamboo, non-teak wooden furniture, and fish maw. 
Burmese legal exports were cut in half in 2003 when the RTG 
banned the import of teak furniture and teak logs without a 
GOB certificate of origin.  Thai businesspeople had been 
secretly sending Thai teak, the cutting of which is currently 
 
SIPDIS 
banned, to Burma to be re-imported as \"Burmese\" furniture or 
logs. 
 
6. (C) Smuggling is a major component of the Mae Sot-Myawaddy 
trade.  Because the GOB bans most of what Thailand exports to 
Burma (especially consumer goods), only 10 percent of the 
Thai exports, mostly construction inputs, enter Burma at the 
GOB Customs checkpoint on the Friendship Bridge.  The 
remaining 90 percent is checked out of Thailand legally at 
one of the 16 RTG Customs docks stretching 5 km along the 
Moei River, and then smuggled into Burma on the other side. 
Smuggling is not as active coming from Burma, though Thai 
businesspeople estimate that contraband teak products and 
gems add another 10-20 percent per month to the Thai import 
numbers.  Thai Customs told us that there are also periodic 
seizures of amphetamines -- including a shipment in October 
2003 of 9.4 million pills.  Strangely, Myawaddy 
businesspeople complained it was necessary to smuggle Thai 
cement into the border areas, as RTG authorities purportedly 
ban this border trade to avoid giving the GOB material to 
build bunkers. 
 
7. (C) Another boon to Mae Sot and Myawaddy border traders is 
the weaker GOB hand in Karen State.  Though the Friendship 
Bridge is controlled by the Burmese army and \"NaSaKa\" 
inter-agency border force, the smaller riverine border trade 
crossings and the transportation network once inside Burma 
have been left in the hands of the ethnic Karen armed groups 
-- especially the pro-Rangoon Democratic Karen Buddhist Army 
(DKBA).  Though there are countless DKBA and anti-Rangoon 
Karen National Union (KNU) checkpoints on the 
Myawaddy-Rangoon road, Thai exporters and Burmese importers 
alike say they are content with the arrangement as a single 
payment to an ethnic broker in Myawaddy is usually adequate 
to ensure a safe journey.  Contrast this to trade routes 
firmly in the GOB\'s hands such as Kawthaung where, Burmese 
importers complain, multiple payments are required though 
they do not guarantee hassle-free passage.  Thai exporters 
were unanimous, though, that business would be even better if 
there were a cease-fire agreement completed between the SPDC 
and the KNU. 
 
Comment: 
 
8. (C) The relentless movement of goods from Mae Sot to 
Myawaddy is one of the major sources of lifeblood for Burma\'s 
troubled economy and government (ref C).  Though the trade 
flows we examined are solidly in Thailand\'s favor, the 
products sold are generally not unique and are easily 
replaced -- even in Myawaddy\'s marketplaces -- by Chinese 
goods.  Thailand\'s border entrepreneurs often look westward 
for natural resources off limits or not available 
domestically or from other bordering states.  Thus, a 
Thai-Burma border closing, as occurred in 2002, would hurt 
the Mae Sot Thai exporting community as much or more than the 
Burmese.  End comment

 1.  (C)  Summary:  The Chinese ambassador to Burma 
characterized the recent visit by Vice Premier Wu Yi as a 
\"big event\" for bilateral relations, noting 21 agreements had 
been signed and commenting that China had selected areas of 
cooperation that would be of import not only to the current 
regime but to any future Burmese government.  Ambassador Li 
stated his view that ASSK would be released prior to May 17th 
and that recent movement on the National Convention 
demonstrated a compromise had been reached between the 
government and the NLD.  Li had a positive view of the 
Bangkok Process and urged that all international participants 
behave (read: be non-confrontational) so that this window on 
Burma would remain open.  End Summary. 
 
Outcome of Vice Premier Visit:  Agreements and MOU\'s 
 
2.  (C) During a April 6 meeting between COM and the Chinese 
ambassador to Burma, Li Jinjun, Ambassador Li provided an 
overview of Vice Premier Wu Yi\'s March visit (refs A and B), 
describing it as a \"big event\" for bilateral relations. 
Noting that trade between Burma and China has been developing 
smoothly, Ambassador Li said the purpose of the recent visit 
was to explore and deepen bilateral cooperation in five 
mutually agreed upon spheres:  agriculture, infrastructure, 
natural resources, manufacturing, and human resource 
development.  In addition, China offered to provide increased 
funding via development assistance, preferential loans, and 
export credits.  Ambassador Li commented that China had 
selected areas that would be of import not only to the 
current regime but to any future Burmese government.  While 
noting that 21 agreements had been signed, Li did not mention 
an accord to reschedule around $120 million in unpaid Burmese 
debt to Chinese firms (ref B). 
 
3.  (C) Ambassador Li acknowledged that formal bilateral 
trade heavily favors China and that China is making efforts 
to improve the trade balance by helping Burma to export its 
natural resources.  When asked by COM whether Wu Yi had used 
her meetings with regime leaders Than Shwe, Maung Aye, and 
Khin Nyunt to initiate discussion on the need for significant 
economic and financial reforms, Ambassador Li explained that 
it would not have been appropriate for her to do so because 
such topics are considered sensitive by the current regime 
and, in any event, China does not interfere in the internal 
affairs of sovereign nations.  Ambassador Li conceded, 
however, that the speed of reform depends on the current 
leaders and that if they don\'t \"open their minds,\" it doesn\'t 
matter how fast China is willing to move forward on assisting 
with economic reform.  (Note:  In 2003, senior GOB leaders 
elected to completely ignore a comprehensive economic reform 
framework compiled at great expense by the Japanese 
government. End Note.) 
 
The National Convention and the Bangkok Process 
 
4. (C) Ambassador Li blithely offered that the release of 
Aung San Suu Kyi was not a problem and that the SPDC and NLD 
merely needed to \"agree on timing,\" later stating that ASSK 
definitely would be released prior to the start of the 
National Convention on 17 May.  He also said that SPDC 
Chairman Than Shwe had told Wu Yi that the military 
government did not intend to \"stay on stage\" forever and 
wanted to hand over power to an \"appropriate\" group. 
Ambassador Li assessed that recent efforts such as the 
Bangkok Process and the announcement of the date for 
reconvening the National Convention demonstrated the 
government\'s increased confidence.  Ambassador Li said that 
the announcement strongly indicated that a compromise must 
have been reached between the government and the NLD. 
 
5. (C) When pressed by COM on whether Vice Premier Wu Yi had 
raised the National Convention process, Ambassador Li 
reaffirmed that China does not interfere in this type of 
internal affair and said that \"the details were not 
important.\"  Without any trace of irony, Ambassador Li then 
explained that the key issue in regard to the National 
Convention was creating a cooperative atmosphere.  COM urged 
the PRC, given its significant influence in Burma, to tell 
the GOB that the road map process had to be inclusive, as the 
GOB was likely to take such advice to heart.  Demurring on 
this point, Ambassador Li agreed, however, that the process 
of a transition to democracy needed to be inclusive and that 
the NLD had to be involved. 
 
6. (SBU) Ambassador Li opined that the Bangkok Process was 
valuable because it provided the international community with 
a window into the current situation in Burma and the Burmese 
government with a view of the \"real attitude\" of the 
international community.  As a result, the international 
community must not make any mistakes that would result in the 
Burmese government closing this window and should strive to 
make positive remarks so that the Burmese government will 
continue to move forward.  In an aside, Ambassador Li 
commented, again without irony, that perhaps the best 
approach to take with the current regime is to treat it in 
the same way one would treat a child, e.g., encourage good 
behavior with appropriate rewards.  COM countered that 
pressure was necessary and that the GOB would not have taken 
any steps had pressure not been exerted. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  China continues to increase its economic 
investment in Burma while maintaining its hands-off approach 
on internal political issues, as evidenced by Ambassador\'s 
Li\'s continued reluctance to meet with opposition figures, 
despite approaches by the NLD (ref C).  Ambassador\'s Li\'s 
recognition that a cooperative, trusting atmosphere is a 
necessary prerequisite for eventual democratic transition 
notwithstanding, he appears to have little interest in 
playing a role or even advocating concrete measures to 
achieve this aim.  Quite the contrary, China\'s continued 
diplomatic and economic support for the current regime helps 
immunize it to U.S. and international pressure.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The Chinese ambassador to Burma advocates 
shifting international focus from counter-drug activities 
toward alternative and long-term development as a means to 
keep farmers from cultivating poppy and producing opium.  He 
said current PRC counternarcotics activities in Burma are 
mostly Yunnan-based, although Beijing is undertaking efforts 
to apply greater central oversight in order to improve 
China\'s cooperation with international efforts.  We suggested 
that a PRC contribution to UNODC programs would be an 
important sign of China\'s willingness to coordinate efforts. 
The Chinese ambassador was receptive to the idea.  End 
Comment. 
 
2. (U) On April 6, COM and P/E officers met with Chinese 
Ambassador Li Jinjun to discuss the recent visit of Vice 
Premier Wu Yi and sundry developments in Burma (reftel). 
During that meeting, we had the opportunity to exchange views 
on a variety of counternarcotics issues. 
 
\"Move Beyond Anti-drug Activities\" 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Ambassador Li said he had recently visited the Kokang 
border region of northeastern Shan State and concluded, as he 
had in the neighboring Wa region, that counterdrug efforts 
should not be limited to ceasing opium production.  He said 
that the international community should help local poppy 
farmers with alternatives and basic survival.  \"Without 
poverty alleviation,\" Li said, \"drugs will stay,\" adding that 
he anticipates some Wa farmers will be unable to meet the 
2005 opium-free deadline.  Li said that China has provided 
assistance for rubber plantations, but noted that many 
alternative crops had minimal opportunities for value-added 
production and he advocated international support for job 
creation, income generation, and energy production. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador Li observed that Kokang and Wa farmers 
faced severe short-term food shortages that accompanied their 
reduction in poppy cultivation.  He noted the \"positive\" 
intervention this year of the World Food Program and NGOs to 
provide emergency food assistance (and said that the WFP was 
procuring some food rations from Chinese markets), but said 
that in the long-term farmers needed their own income \"to be 
able to buy their own food from China and other sources.\" 
 
China Seeks Coordination 
------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Li said that to date local authorities in Yunnan 
Province had the primary lead on China\'s counternarcotics 
efforts in Burma and are engaged in cross-border cooperation, 
investment in factories, and \"town to town assistance.\"  He 
said, however, that authorities in Beijing were undertaking 
new efforts to bring Yunnan-based activities under central 
PRC government control in order to \"coordinate 
counternarcotics efforts with the international community, 
including the U.S.\" 
 
6. (C) The COM asked Ambassador Li about Chinese views on Wa 
druglords who have well known relations with Chinese 
traffickers and investors.  Li responded that the PRC\'s 
central drug committee is focused on these activities and 
recently opened a branch office in Yunnan Province to monitor 
local anti-drug efforts.  However, Li said his top priority 
remained to shift the focus from counternarcotics activities 
toward development issues and he would continue to \"try and 
convince Beijing\" to redirect resources appropriately. 
 
Ante Up 
------- 
 
7. (C) In response to Li\'s stated desire of the PRC to 
encourage greater international cooperation, we urged him to 
seek Beijing assistance for UNODC activities in Burma.  We 
noted that, at China\'s request, the local version of the 
mini-Dublin group had recently expanded to include the PRC, 
India, and Thailand as recognition of their interest and 
involvement in addressing Burma\'s drug problems.  Even a 
symbolic PRC contribution to UNODC\'s Wa or Kokang projects, 
we said, would be an important sign of China\'s interest in 
improving international coordination, adding that UNODC 
projects contained several alternative development components 
that matched China\'s objectives more closely than those of 
the U.S. 
 
8. (C) Ambassador Li said the suggestion of a Chinese 
contribution to UNODC was \"a very good idea\" and he would 
propose it to Beijing.  \"Our current approach is at the local 
level,\" he acknowledged, \"and we need be in sync with the 
rest of the international community and the UN framework is 
very effective.\" 
 
9. (C) Comment: Subsequent to our meeting with Ambassador Li, 
we suggested to UNODC representative Jean-Luc Lemahieu that 
he consider sending copies of his KOWI and Wa project 
proposals to the Chinese Embassy.  He agreed and was pleased 
to learn about Ambassador Li\'s enthusiasm, but expressed 
doubts that China, a recipient of UN funding, would \"tip the 
balance\" and donate to a UN program in Burma.  Nonetheless, 
Lemahieu said that in recent months China had stepped up 
counternarcotics activities and in general was becoming 
\"increasingly open and cooperative with UN and regional 
activities.\"  End Comment.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Leaders of the pro-regime National Unity 
Party (NUP) reveal an outlook on Burma and the world 
reminiscent of the bygone days of Ne Win and his \"Burmese Way 
to Socialism\" ideology, which viewed the international 
community, and domestic dissenters, as enemies of the state. 
The NUP stands firmly behind the current military regime, 
which has a similar view of the world but lacks any ideology 
or real intellect, thus allowing the party to maintain a 
flimsy, but national, political operation.  However, we see 
little evidence the SPDC has identified the NUP as its 
vehicle for any future electoral process.  A more likely 
vehicle is the regime\'s mass member organization, the USDA, 
which is capable of mobilizing millions of obedient 
\"volunteers\" on short notice.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) P/E chief recently met with leaders of the National 
Unity Party (NUP), the pro-regime political party that in 
1988 succeeded former dictator Ne Win\'s Burma Socialist 
Program Party (BSPP).  The senior member among the NUP 
leaders was U Khin Maung Gyi, a member of the party\'s Central 
Executive Committee and a former Minister of Commerce under 
Ne Win. 
 
3. (C) Khin Maung Gyi claimed that his NUP party had changed 
its philosophical outlook over the past 16 years since the 
BSPP and Ne Win were ousted from power.  Given Burma\'s 
transformation from a planned economy to a mixed market 
economy, he said, the NUP no longer advocated a purely 
socialist approach to governance.  However, he added hastily, 
the NUP\'s major themes remained the same: \"We work for the 
people and seek an equitable distribution of income.\" 
 
4. (C) NUP leaders claim that their party has 500,000 \"card 
carrying\" official members throughout Burma and another 2.5 
million \"sympathizers and associate members.\"  Khin Maung Kyi 
said that the party had lost about half of its membership 
after GOB officials, with NUP support, instituted regulations 
that bar civil servants from joining political parties. 
Furthermore, the Electoral Commission has placed a moratorium 
on new membership in all parties, \"in order,\" he said 
sympathetically, \"to preserve national stability.\" 
Nonetheless, he added, the NUP has over 300 functioning 
offices in Burma, \"in every township, except those east of 
the Salween River (in ethnic minority areas of Shan State).\" 
 
5. (C) Khin Maung Gyi said that the NUP had encouraged the 
GOB to reconvene the National Convention and declared that 
his party would \"absolutely\" attend in order to \"say what is 
on our minds.\"  When pressed on the NUP\'s objectives, he said 
the NUP would seek to \"bridge gaps\" between political 
parties, but insisted that the 1993-1996 Convention had 
already covered the basic sections and fundamental principles 
for a new constitution.  \"We have just a few minor details to 
address,\" he said, \"and the constitution will be complete.\" 
 
6. (C) When queried about the role of the NLD and Aung San 
Suu Kyi, Khin Maung Gyi was dismissive and referred to the 
NLD as \"undercover communists.\"  He claimed that Burma had 
only two truly \"national\" political parties (the NUP and the 
NLD), and the NUP was clearly \"the largest and most widely 
represented.\"  He claimed that the NUP had garnered half of 
the popular vote in 1990 elections and said the NLD no longer 
had a national presence.  (Note: the NUP came in fourth place 
behind the NLD, the SNLD and the ALD and won only ten of 485 
seats in Parliament.  End Note)  We observed that, given the 
GOB\'s closure of NLD offices and persecution of NLD leaders 
and members, it was irresponsible to conclude the NLD did not 
have a national operations.  Khin Maung Gyi replied that the 
closure of NLD offices was \"superficial\" and that NLD members 
had ample opportunity to \"be active (underground).\" 
 
7. (C) Although Khin Maung Kyi allowed that \"all political 
parties must be at the National Convention, including the 
NLD,\" he said there was no room to be \"partisan.\"  The 
Convention, he said, \"will decide the future of the country 
for the next two decades and this is not an opportunity for 
disagreement -- we must think of the national interest.\"  We 
noted that ASSK remained under house arrest less than a 
quarter mile from NUP headquarters and questioned how this 
could constitute participation in the process.  \"NLD leaders 
are under arrest,\" he replied, \"because they refuse to leave 
home.\" He added that, while the NLD has a certain courage in 
dissenting from SPDC policies, \"we, the NUP, follow the rules 
and stay in bounds, because these are not normal times.\" 
 
8. (C) Comment: Khin Maung Kyi and his NUP colleagues were 
full of fire and brimstone, eerily reminiscent of the bygone 
days of Ne Win and his \"Burmese Way to Socialism\" ideology, 
which viewed the international community, and domestic 
dissenters, as enemies of the state.  The NUP, ironically, 
appears quite comfortable under the thumb of their new 
masters, the SPDC military regime, which has a similar view 
of the world, but lacks any fundamental political ideology or 
intellectual approach to governance.  The NUP stands firmly 
behind the regime and thus enjoys ample patronage and 
resources to maintain a flimsy, but national, network. 
However, we see little evidence the SPDC has identified the 
NUP as its vehicle for any future electoral process.  A more 
likely vehicle is the regime\'s mass member organization, the 
Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), which is 
capable of mobilizing millions of obedient \"volunteers\" on 
short notice.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: Despite predictions that new U.S. sanctions 
would cause major changes in border trade and migration, a 
recent visit by Bangkok and Rangoon Econoffs to two of the 
three major Thai-Burma border crossings (refs A and B) shows 
business as usual in the movement of goods and people. 
Though border trade has not spiked since the sanctions came 
into effect, it continues to grow because of the generally 
informal nature of the border trade.  The flow of economic 
migrants to Thailand has also not risen dramatically since 
the new sanctions took effect, but thousands of Burmese 
continue to flock across the border in search of better 
economic opportunity.  The Thai government has started some 
assistance programs aimed at developing Burma\'s border area 
economy.  However, local businesspeople on both sides are 
skeptical that such an approach will have much impact.  End

Border Trade Booms Despite Sanctions

effect in July 2003), on the Thai-Burmese border at Ranong

(Thailand)-Myawaddy (Burma; ref A) businesspeople said they\'d 
seen few notable changes.  Since July 2003, the volume of 
trade has continued to rise in both areas, though there has 
been no unusual jump in volume either legal or illegal.  Thai 
traders in Mae Sot said they have noticed a more lax attitude 
at Burmese Customs to the free flow of goods in the last 
year.  However, a Burmese trader in Kawthaung said that, to 
the contrary, import licenses for border trade have become 
dearer since Rangoon re-asserted control over issuance -- a 
right previously devolved to local GOB Border Trade 
Department officials. 
 
3. (C) Border trade trends are independent from those of 
non-border commerce (which has fallen dramatically since last 
summer) because of the informal nature of border trade, even 
if done legally.  Businesspeople contract almost exclusively 
with friends, and payments are nearly always routed via an 
unofficial, and illegal in Burma, hundi system.  (The hundi 
system is an unofficial network that is used worldwide to 
send remittances and provide trade settlement across 
borders.)  For legal border trade imports into Burma, 
underinvoicing is the rule, with hundi payments used make up 
the difference.  Thai-Burma border traders are further 
insulated from the impact of the 2003 sanctions because they 
rarely use USD for their transactions, instead dealing in 
Burmese kyat or Thai baht. 
 
4. (C) Thai businesspeople on the border were universally 
negative about the U.S. sanctions.  Though they are unlikely 
democracy boosters and are no champions of the Burmese 
everyman, some pled the case of the \"poor Burmese\" suffering 
under sanctions-induced economic problems, making it 
impossible for them to \"think of democracy.\"  Others were 
more parochial, saying sanctions induced increased illegal 
immigration which burdened Thailand.  Most supported PM 
Thaksin\'s decision to engage with the SPDC, saying the 
previous PM\'s support for U.S. policy on Burma had led to a 
GOB crackdown on Thai trade and businesspeople in general. 
 
5. (C) However, Thai and Burmese businessmen did not blame 
sanctions for the poor economic climate in Burma and the need 
for smuggling.  Instead they pointed to the mercurial trade 
policy of the GOB.  All agreed that nearly all products could 
be traded legally or illegally depending on the current GOB 
restrictions. 
 
Economic Migrants: An Unstoppable Flow 
 
6. (C) It is clear that Burma\'s major export to Thailand at 
both border points is people.  An international NGO in Ranong 
(Thailand) told us as much as 40 percent of the city\'s 
250,000 population is Burmese, the vast majority working  in 
fish processing factories and in construction.  Many more 
cross over and move further inland into Thailand seeking a 
better economic situation elsewhere.  Likewise in Mae Sot, 
the population of Burmese migrants is very high, with 
2,500-4,000 crossing into Thailand every day.  Many return to 
Myawaddy at night, but many others stay to work in shops, in 
the agricultural sector, or in the foreign-owned garment 
factories of Mae Sot. 
 
7. (C) Labor organizers in Mae Sot report that these 
migrants, even those few who register with the Thai labor 
authorities, face harsh working conditions and wages about 50 
percent of the Thai minimum wage (about USD 3.50/day). 
However, even this small sum is probably 100-250 percent what 
they would make as laborers in Burma so the inflow of Burmese 
workers is relentless. 
 
8. (C) Local representatives of World Vision, a USG partner 
in anti-trafficking and HIV/AIDS efforts in the region, 
report that while trafficking of Burmese women into Ranong is 
rare, Mae Sot does serve as a portal for trafficked persons 
and economic migrants to other destinations in Thailand.  One 
estimate from Ranong was that only 10 percent of migrants 
there were \"trafficked,\" and few illegal Burmese in town were 
working as prostitutes.  Mae Sot has a more organized labor 
export business from Burma -- involving the private sector 
and authorities on both sides of the border -- which charged 
would-be migrants USD 175 a head to cross through the jungle 
and USD 375 a head to be smuggled in by truck. 
 
9. (C) Thai NGOs and local factory owners told us that there 
had not been a large increase in migrants since the new 
sanctions, which also banned imports of Burmese products, 
took hold last July.  However, the steady inflow of workers 
was certainly higher than the demand for cheap labor on the 
Thai side in both Ranong and Mae Sot.  One labor NGO leader 
in Mae Sot said that he had seen an increase in female job 
seekers from Rangoon and Mandalay since the sanctions, 
alongside the normal crowd from Karen and Mon States. 
 
Thailand\'s ECS Plan Has Little Impact at Border 
 
10. (SBU) Since the initiation of the Economic Cooperation 
Strategy (ECS) program in 2003 (ref E), the RTG has worked to 
spur bilateral trade and provide technical training and 
development aid to Burma.  The Thai Finance Ministry is 
currently considering eliminating import tariff rates on 751 
products from Burma under the ASEAN Integrated System of 
Preferences (AISP). According to Thai Ministry of Commerce 
(MoC) officials, the RTG will soon allow duty free entry of 
eight agricultural products -- maize, sweet corn, soybeans, 
potatoes, eucalyptus, sesame seeds, and cashew nuts -- from 
Burma, Laos, and Cambodia.  Under the ECS program, Thailand, 
a net importer of soybeans, plans to provide technical 
training to Burmese farmers to help improve quality; in Mae 
Sot, local businessmen opined that at some point in the 
future, contract farming might be a viable investment, 
boosting agricultural trade.  In addition, the RTG has vowed 
to build a road from Myawaddy to the base of the Karen hills 
18 km from the border as part of a larger effort to create a 
road link across central Burma, from Thailand to India. 
According to a Thai MFA source, this project is \"well under 
way,\" with funding from the Asian Development Bank. 
 
11. (SBU) Businessmen in Ranong, however, complained that the 
ECS program favors large Thai companies with close ties to 
leaders in Bangkok, and will likely have very little impact 
on the realities of cross border trade in the provinces.  In 
any case, as both Thai MoC officials and local traders 
pointed out, the ECS program did little to improve the 
biggest hurdles in dealing with Burma -- the chronically 
uncertain investment climate.  The constant threat of 
appropriation by the GOB leaves little incentive for Thai 
businessmen to seek local partnerships.  A Thai MoC official 
noted that efforts to forge a bilateral investment and border 
trade agreement have been ongoing for almost ten years,  with 
little success.  Even if such an agreement were possible, she 
admitted, this document would still be \"just paper.\" 
Comment: Squeezing the Balloon 
12. (C) The RTG\'s efforts to stimulate the border economy are 
logical considering the demand for some Burmese products and 
the desire to stem illegal migration.  However, the success 
of this project, like so many other traditional efforts to 
develop Burma\'s rudimentary economy, will depend on the will 
of the Burmese regime to take advantage of the proffered 
assistance.  For instance, the Burmese government is 
inexplicably banning the export of some of the products for 
which Thailand is thinking of allowing tariff-free access. 
Even if the ECS projects do not succeed in stimulating 
Burma\'s formal economy and legal trade, and U.S. sanctions 
continue, we are confident that the close personal links 
between businesspeople on both sides of the borders will 
ensure informal trade of goods continues to pick up a good 
deal of the slack.  Likewise, until employment opportunities 
in Burma increase drastically, the allure of even Thailand\'s 
worst-paying jobs will be significant for hundreds of 
thousands of poor Burmese.  End comment

1. (C) Summary:  According to an MFA contact, Burma has opted 
out of the second meeting of the \"Bangkok Process\" and 
requested a postponement of at least one month, likely part 
of an effort to focus exclusively on reconvening the National 
Convention on May 17.  We suspect the GOB realizes that the 
recent release of two NLD CEC members and the reopening of 
NLD headquarters is, in the eyes of the international 
community, no substitute for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 Should the SPDC continue to detain ASSK, the generals are 
likely to assiduously avoid any venue where criticism could 
derail the reconvening of the Convention.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) According to the Director of the Americas Division at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U Thant Kyaw, the GOB has 
officially informed the Thai Government that Burma will not 
attend the second meeting of the \"Bangkok Process,\" scheduled 
for April 29-30. 
 
3. (C) On April 23, U Thant Kyaw told us the GOB had informed 
the RTG that Foreign Minister U Win Aung was \"not available\" 
in late April and had therefore requested a postponement of 
Bangkok II for \"at least one month.\"  He said that 
discussions were under way between the GOB and the RTG to 
identify a new date, a process that has been somewhat 
hampered by the absence of Deputy FM U Khin Maung Win, who is 
on leave following the untimely death of his wife earlier 
this week. 
 
4. (C) In response to our query on the reason for postponing 
the meeting, U Thant Kyaw would only say that the \"matter is 
complicated and difficult to explain.\"  He acknowledged that 
FM Win Aung had previously agreed to attend the meeting and 
noted that the RTG had already issued official invitations to 
participants.  However, he added, the FM is \"involved in 
serious matters and must be in Rangoon during the coming 
weeks.\" 
 
5. (C) Comment:  We have seen several signs that the SPDC is 
clearing the deck to prepare for the reconvening of the 
National Convention on May 17.  In addition to the Bangkok 
meeting, the GOB has apparently postponed the next round of 
peace talks with the KNU, which had been scheduled to resume 
this month.  Ultimately, however, the regime\'s motives 
involve more than mere scheduling conflicts.  Senior GOB 
officials clearly realize that the recent release of two NLD 
CEC members and the reopening of NLD headquarters is, in the 
eyes of the international community, no substitute for the 
release of Aung San Suu Kyi.  Should the SPDC continue to 
detain ASSK, the generals are likely to assiduously avoid any 
venue where criticism could derail the reconvening of the 
National Convention.  End Comment.

1.  (C) SUMMARY:  According to a well-placed, Rangoon-based 
ethnic Karen leader, the Karen National Union (KNU) will send 
a two-person observer delegation to the National Convention 
(NC) in May.  The postponed SPDC-KNU talks originally 
scheduled for late April could take place in late May, 
despite the resumption of the NC on May 17.  Local Karen 
sources say 12 ethnic Karens, including three Rangoon-based 
Karen civic leaders and five Democratic Karen Burmese Army 
(DKBA) members, will attend the NC as full delegates.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) According to a senior Rangoon-based Karen Development 
Community (KDC) leader involved in setting up the January 
SPDC-KNU cease-fire talks, even though the talks planned for 
late April have been postponed (ref A), the KNU is planning 
to send a two member \"observer\" delegation to the National 
Convention.  The contact further reported that the observer 
group will supposedly consist of KNU General Secretary Pad 
Mahn Sha, and Joint General Secretary Pado David Htaw, and 
will not participate in any formal NC discussions or debates. 
 The KDC leader was optimistic that SPDC-KNU talks will 
resume in mid-May and will conclude with a lasting 
settlement. 
 
3.  (C) Our KDC contact also informed us that the SPDC has 
invited him and two other Karen civic leaders from Rangoon, 
and one previously unknown Karen schoolteacher from Myawaddy 
(COMMENT: Most likely a trustworthy, pro-regime USDA member), 
to attend the NC as \"Specially Invited Guest\" delegates.  In 
addition, the SPDC has invited five DKBA delegates to attend. 
 Another senior Rangoon-based KDC leader, who was present at 
the January SPDC-KNU cease-fire talks and has strong ties 
with the GOB, affirmed that over 10 ethnic Karens will be 
attending the NC. 
 
4.  (C) The KDC leader with strong GOB ties commented to us 
that the one-month postponement of SPDC-KNU talks is a good 
thing, as it will give the KNU commanders more time to 
prepare for the discussion on demarcation and troop 
placement.  He believes that the SPDC will agree to give the 
KNU seven areas of control, corresponding to the present 
mountainous locations of the seven KNU brigades in eastern 
Karen State.  Apparently, the SPDC will also allow a KNU 
office to be set up in Pa-an (Hpa-an), the capital of Karen 
State. 
 
5.  (C) COMMENT: If the KNU has agreed to send observers to 
the Convention, the KNU then will at least be able to confer 
with the friendly Burma-based ethnic Karen delegates during 
the NC and discuss issues pertaining to pan-Karen political 
and cultural aspirations.  The KNU observers could also 
confer with several other ethnic delegations concerning 
constitutional issues important to them all.  However, in 
agreeing now to send observers, the KNU may have given up 
scant remaining leverage they could have used in the next 
round of talks with the SPDC.  END COMMENT.

1.  (C) On April 25 the GOB released 24 more of the estimated 
250 pro-democracy activists arrested across Burma in the 
government crackdown immediately following the May 30, 2003 
attack on the National League for Democracy (NLD) convoy at 
Depayin.  Four other NLD members, including an MP-elect, who 
had been arrested the week prior to the Depayin attack, were 
also released on April 25.  Though the GOB has been releasing 
a handful of post-Depayin prisoners every month or so (ref) 
NLD sources estimate over 100 of them are still in detention. 
 
 
2.  (U) Since the approximately 250 activists (both NLD 
members and NLD supporters) were arrested on the fringes of 
the Depayin attack, and as they were not part of the official 
NLD convoy on May 30, their numbers were not included in the 
official NLD and UN list of 135 people arrested at Depayin. 
Of the \"official\" 135, all have been released except for Aung 
San Suu Kyi and U Tin Oo, who both remain under house arrest 
in Rangoon. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT:  Some of the newly released activists (10 
from Mandalay prison and 17 from Shwebo prison) had received 
sentences ranging from two years or to nine years in prison 
for various fabricated criminal offenses.  Releasing them 
after less than a year served may be a sign the GOB is 
attempting to entice the NLD to join the National Convention. 
 The regime may be hopeful that the releases will help to 
remove festering reminders of the May 30 attack in advance of 
the May 17 opening of the National Convention.  END COMMENT.

REF: RANGOON 174 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Three of Burma\'s private banks, re-opened 
under tight new regulations in February, seem to be surviving 
nicely in the new environment.  With deposits reaching 
pre-crash levels, the banks are set to start issuing loans 
for the first time since February 2003.  However, this bright 
spot is a mere candle in Burma\'s long economic night, as the 
largest private banks (holding 65 percent of pre-crash 
deposits) remain closed indefinitely.  End summary. 
 
If You Open, It Will Come 
 
2. (SBU) Much to the relief of the three newly re-opened 
private banks, some customers have returned bringing with 
them significant deposits.  On the other side of the ledger, 
withdrawals have stabilized.  The authorities allowed these 
three banks, Kanbawza (KBZ), Myanmar Universal (MUB), and 
Myanmar Oriental (MOB), to re-open on February 3 almost 
12-months after the private banking sector collapsed 
following a massive run.  As a condition of their re-opening, 
the government imposed several new and quite restrictive 
regulations (reftel), including a ban on credit cards and a 
\"temporary\" cap on deposits at seven-times paid-in capital. 
Two other private banks, the largest by deposits and assets 
pre-crash, Asia Wealth (AWB) and Yoma, remain shuttered with 
no sign of an imminent change.  The last of the \"big six,\" 
Myanmar Mayflower, the fourth largest pre-crash, also remains 
under wraps (and ostensibly under investigation, alongside 
AWB, for money laundering). 
 
3. (C) Since being freed to operate, KBZ and MOB have been 
receiving more deposits than expected.  Two KBZ officials 
told us that they were nearly up against the deposit ceiling 
-- a predicament they hadn\'t expected for another several 
months.  Other banking sources estimated that MOB would hit 
its cap sometime in June.  There is no word on the status of 
MUB\'s deposit inflows.  The new deposits are likely from 
traders who had been forced during the period of banking 
shutdown to send and receive domestic remittances via the 
informal hundi network.  This is a widespread and oft-used 
system, though it is rather risky and has trouble handling 
extremely large transactions. 
 
4. (C) To address this potential deposit cap problem, the 
banks have two choices: increase their capital or, in 
traditional Burmese fashion, ignore the new rule.  According 
to banking sources, the re-opened banks have not yet been 
audited by GOB authorities to ensure compliance with the new 
restrictions, though an oversight committee remains in place. 
 Another factor that will encourage scoffing the law is the 
reluctance of owners to pony up more cash.  Because of a 
stagnant business environment, few in Burma are flush with 
capital these days.  Also, the banks are still in precarious 
situations and are thus not yet low-risk investments. 
 
Let the Lending Begin 
 
5. (SBU) Another positive sign is the GOB\'s approval of new 
lending by the three re-opened banks.  Though this right was 
ostensibly given back in February, banking officials told us 
it was not until April 6th that authorities actually gave the 
green light.  Per the new regulations, loans may not exceed 
80 percent of deposits. 
 
Comment: A Drop in the Bucket 
 
6. (C) When new loans make it into the economy, it will help 
lubricate a machine that\'s been cash-starved for more than a 
year.  Likewise, increasing deposits will help keep domestic 
commerce above water.  However, we remain skeptical that this 
\"soft\" re-opening of the private banking sector will energize 
the economy much.  The reason is the relatively small 
contribution KBZ, MUB, and MOB make to the country\'s 
financial condition.  Look at the numbers: KBZ, the largest 
by far of the three liberated banks, has only 6.2 billion 
kyat (about US$7.5 million) in paid-up capital.  This means 
its maximum deposits are $52.5 million and maximum new loans 
are US$42 million.  For comparison sake, at the end of 2002 
(just before the crisis) Burma\'s private banks reported about 
US$625 million (at the current 820 kyat/$ rate) in deposits 
and outstanding loans of about US$430 million.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  For the first time in a year the NLD CEC met 
this week as a full group, including detained leaders ASSK 
and U Tin Oo.  Over the course of two private sessions, 
facilitated by military intelligence, the party leadership 
formed a series of \"suggestions\" that the SPDC must take on 
board in order for the NLD to attend the upcoming National 
Convention.  Among their demands, the CEC insists on the 
release from house arrest of ASSK and U Tin Oo, the reopening 
of all NLD offices, and a timetable for the regime\'s road 
map.  Party leaders also seek to have their long-standing 
procedural concerns regarding the Convention addressed in a 
dialogue between ASSK and regime leaders.  Although NLD 
Chairman U Aung Shwe says if the regime agrees to NLD 
suggestions the party will attend the Convention, the free 
CEC members led us to conclude that the NLD may be 
considering attendance as a tactical move and they harbor few 
expectations the process will involve meaningful political 
dialogue.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) With two weeks remaining before the SPDC reconvenes 
the National Convention (\"adjourned\" since 1996), Rangoon has 
over the past week been the scene of intense deliberations 
among political opposition party leaders and, by some 
accounts, negotiations with regime envoys on conditions for 
participation in the Convention.  (Note: The National 
Convention is scheduled to reconvene on May 17, but 
registration for delegates begins on May 14.  End Note) 
 
Reunited 
-------- 
 
3. (C) On April 27, the SPDC allowed all nine members of the 
NLD Central Executive Committee (CEC) to convene and discuss 
party matters.  The two-hour session included General 
Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) and Vice Chairman U Tin Oo, 
 
SIPDIS 
both detained under house arrest, and took place at ASSK\'s 
lakeside house in central Rangoon.  Military intelligence 
approved the meeting and arranged for the transfer of U Tin 
Oo from his house, but permitted the CEC to hold their 
discussions in private.  According to NLD Secretary U Lwin, 
the CEC, convening for the first time as a whole in almost 
one year, met for about two hours but came to no resolution 
on participation in the National Convention. 
 
4. (C) The entire NLD CEC met again on Thursday April 29, 
under the same conditions as on April 27, and their internal 
discussions lasted for over five hours.  P/E chief and 
visiting desk officer-designate met on April 30 with all 
seven of the \"free\" CEC members and discussed recent 
developments. 
 
Might We Suggest... 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) According to Chairman U Aung Shwe, \"two days was 
sufficient\" for the NLD leadership to meet and develop a 
party position on attendance at the National Convention. 
Although the CEC members were cautious about revealing 
details of their internal discussions, they said that the NLD 
had prepared a list of \"suggestions\" for the SPDC to 
consider.  The NLD leaders studiously avoided using the term 
\"conditions,\" but insisted that the regime needed to agree to 
all of the NLD suggestions in order for the party to attend 
the upcoming Convention. 
 
6. (C) U Aung Shwe and party spokesman U Lwin said that, at a 
minimum, the regime needed to release ASSK and U Tin Oo, open 
all NLD party offices closed since May 2003 (note: a total of 
210 offices), and provide a timetable for the \"road map to 
democracy.\"  CEC member U Nyunt Wei added that the NLD 
insisted all offices be reopened because with only the 
Rangoon headquarters in operation, \"we (the NLD) are merely a 
head without a tail.\" 
 
7. (C) We raised with the CEC members their statement of 
April 16 (ref C) which laid out the party\'s specific demands 
and grievances with regard to procedural issues at the 
Convention as well as the reasons for their departure from 
the last Convention in 1995.  U Aung Shwe would not 
characterize these issues as \"conditions\" or \"suggestions\" in 
the context of their current position, but said that the 
party believed they must be the topic of discussion between 
ASSK and regime leaders before the Convention reconvenes. 
 
8. (C) \"If they agree (to our suggestions), we will go to the 
Convention,\" U Aung Shwe said, characterizing NLD demands as 
reasonable.  However, the Chairman also said that he had no 
basis to determine how the regime would respond and observed 
that the SPDC\'s overall plan for a transition was more like a 
\"road block\" than a \"road map.\"  He added that the NLD CEC 
had no immediate plans to meet again as whole and would only 
do so once the SPDC is prepared to respond to the NLD 
position.  The Chairman did not identify specifically how 
they had communicated their new position to the regime, but 
intimated that ASSK would soon meet with regime 
representatives. 
 
Those Who Help and Those Who Don\'t 
---------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) U Lwin expressed frustration with members of the 
international community (\"except the U.S.,\" he added) that 
continued to try and pressure the NLD to attend the National 
Convention.  He said that some countries had approached the 
party to ask, \"You wanted a dialogue, now why are you 
hesitating?\"  U Lwin, visibly angry, said that the NLD 
represented the majority of Burmese and had every right to 
demand concessions from the junta. 
 
10. (C) U Lwin also said that some countries had intimated 
that the NLD, by prolonging the political stalemate, was 
somehow responsible for the suffering caused by international 
sanctions.  \"We have suffered for sixteen years under the 
SLORC and SPDC regimes,\" he said, \"sanctions can not be 
blamed for the (junta\'s) actions; you (who impose sanctions) 
should not retreat because the pressure doesn\'t cause any 
more suffering than we already experience.\"  (Note: We 
informed the CEC members that legislation had been introduced 
in Congress on April 29 to extend the U.S. import ban and 
they nodded with satisfaction.  End Note). 
 
11. (C) In response to our inquiry about any possible role 
for countries in the region, U Nyunt Wei identified ASEAN as 
\"part of the problem.\"  He observed that few among the ASEAN 
countries adhered to democratic principles and many had 
vested interests with the current Burmese regime.  He noted 
that UN Special Envoy Razali had encouraged the NLD to \"turn 
a new page\" but he, U Nyunt Wei, opined that the NLD had no 
more pages to turn.  U Aung Shwe dismissed Thai efforts to 
bring the GOB to the table with some members of the 
international community and said that the \"Bangkok Process 
has nothing to do with us (in the NLD).\" 
 
Comment: A Tactical Move 
------------------------ 
 
12. (C) The seven elderly NLD CEC members appeared healthy 
and relaxed, despite what they described as a long week of 
discussions and developments.  Although international press 
reports have described NLD leaders as optimistic about 
attending the National Convention, the free CEC members 
declined to make any prognosis on the regime\'s response to 
their most recent demands.  However, Chairman U Aung Shwe was 
adamant that the NLD would not repeat the 1993 experience in 
which party delegates attended the Convention while ASSK was 
under house arrest.  Although U Aung Shwe concluded that if 
the regime agrees to NLD suggestions the party will attend 
the Convention, his comments, and those of his colleagues, on 
the regime\'s road map led us to conclude that the NLD may be 
considering attendance as a tactical move and they harbor few 
expectations the process will involve meaningful political 
dialogue.  End Comment.

1. (C)  On April 24 DATT and P/E Chief had an opportunity to 
chat at length with Major General Kyaw Win, second in command 
to General (and Prime Minister) Khin Nyunt as the powerful 
deputy chief of Burma\'s military intelligence.  The occasion 
was a social event, but a significant portion of our 
discussions dealt with political developments in Burma.  A 
few highlights: 
 
--The \"Bangkok Process:\"  General Kyaw Win said that the SPDC 
had decided to \"postpone\" participation in the Bangkok 
Process in order to focus exclusively on reconvening the 
National Convention on May 17 (refs A and B).  He said that 
the GOB would be willing to return to the table in Bangkok, 
but did not specify a date.  He dismissed speculation that 
delegates would register for the Convention and then disband 
for the monsoon season, insisting that the Convention would 
convene \"for at least two months,\" and suggesting that the 
SPDC expected nothing less than a fully approved constitution 
to emerge from the process. 
 
--SPDC-KNU Peace Talks:  Kyaw Win also said that the regime 
had postponed peace talks with the KNU as yet another means 
to clear the deck for the National Convention (refs C and D). 
 The General played down the importance of the peace talks 
with regard to forging a new constitution and talked 
confidently about \"dealing\" with the KNU at an appropriate 
time and place. 
 
--The Old Man\'s Health:  Regarding local rumors that SPDC 
Chairman Than Shwe had recently fallen seriously ill, Kyaw 
Win said that in fact it was the Senior General\'s son who had 
health problems.  Kyaw Win said he had been with Than Shwe 
near Mandalay in mid-April when the Chairman received word 
that his son had been hospitalized in Rangoon with acute 
appendicitis. Than Shwe immediately cut short his upcountry 
travel and his entire delegation returned to Rangoon, setting 
off a spate of rumors that the Chairman had suffered a stroke 
(Note: Than Shwe appeared on state-run television on April 
27, his first \"public\" appearance since Burma\'s April 12-16 
water festival period.  End note). 
 
--Prime Minister Khin Nyunt:  Kyaw Win lamented that his boss 
at the Office of the Chief of Military Intelligence (OCMI), 
General Khin Nyunt, was a consummate workaholic who made it a 
challenge for his subordinates to enjoy leisure time on the 
weekends.  Khin Nyunt convenes a daily briefing with his top 
advisors every single day of the year at 7:30 a.m., even on 
holidays and weekends, and spends his \"free time\" conducting 
inspections and touring the regime\'s latest infrastructure 
projects.  The 59 year-old Kyaw Win, an avid tennis player, 
painter, and photographer, joked that it was part of his job 
description to get mental and physical exercise on behalf of 
Khin Nyunt. 
 
2. (C) Comment:  Although Khin Nyunt retained the military 
intelligence portfolio after assuming new duties as Prime 
Minister last August, General Kyaw Win\'s role increased 
substantially as the day-to-day manager of the SPDC\'s vast 
intelligence network.  His remarks on the National 
Convention, and ongoing efforts to clear the deck before May 
17, were yet another indicator that the regime intends to let 
nothing get in the way of this first step in the Prime 
Minister\'s \"road map.\"  End comment.

SUBJECT: ENERGIZING BURMA\'S SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTREPRENEURS 
 
REF: RANGOON 465 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The executive director of the American 
Chamber of Commerce in Thailand visited Rangoon explaining 
the benefits of a more active civil society role for the 
business community and delivering the message that combined 
voices were more effective in pushing reform.  Progressive 
businesspeople embraced these ideas.  They were keen to take 
steps to counterbalance the dirigisme, cronyism, and 
corruption that currently dominate Burma\'s business 
environment and indicated they wanted to be prepared for a 
future, more democratic Burma.  End summary. 
 
Words to the Wise 
 
2. (SBU) During an April 26-27 visit to Rangoon, the American 
Chamber of Commerce in Thailand\'s executive director spoke to 
several groups of progressive small and medium entrepreneurs: 
including the Myanmar Women\'s Entrepreneur\'s Association, a 
group of female executive MBA students, and a panel of 
increasingly politically active businesspeople.  The message 
to each was clear: businesspeople have a responsibility to 
point out the shortcomings of their government\'s economic and 
trade policies and try to encourage reform.  This point of 
view resonated with the audiences who, unlike the SPDC 
cronies and corrupt businesspeople who dominate Burma\'s 
economy, have a more global outlook and chafe under the 
regressive economic and political policies of the ruling SPDC. 
 
3. (SBU) Another important theme of the visit was that a 
collective voice was better than one, or none.  The message, 
promoting the role of trade associations in civil society, 
was that a government will lend more weight to an opinion 
delivered unanimously on behalf of a large constituency.  In 
the Burmese context, the anonymity granted by this type of 
approach also has tremendous appeal.  Assuming the SPDC wants 
the economy to develop (not at all assured), it might be 
willing to listen to a block representing the entrepreneurs 
the regime relies on to fulfill its \"national objectives\" 
more than the advice of academics, international 
organizations, or foreign governments. 
 
4. (SBU) Many of the businesspeople opined that the regime\'s 
often bizarre economic policymaking may be based in part on 
ignorance rather than obstinacy.  If this is true, the 
executive director made the case that business associations 
have an educating role to play.  The trick, all agreed, was 
finding the best conduit to the key one or two decisionmakers. 
 
Civil Society Lacks Business Input 
 
5. (SBU) At a well-attended talk at the American Center, the 
executive director addressed the topic of \"Business in Civil 
Society.\"  The remarks focused on issues like corporate 
citizenship and the advocacy and educating role of a trade 
association.  As business here plays very little role in 
society other than to make money, these topics were fairly 
new ground for most of the attendees.  However, the concepts 
were very well received and elicited many questions on the 
mechanics of business groups and many requests for further 
capacity building. 
 
Comment: Cautious but Interested 
 
6. (SBU) Throughout the sessions, the businesspeople were 
initially cautious and somewhat skeptical, coming up with 
many excuses why they couldn\'t become more politically 
active.  However, as our discussions progressed they came to 
accept the idea that the business community was not yet 
playing an adequate or positive role in civil society and 
that it should take steps to become better organized. Even if 
influencing this current government was difficult, thought 
and preparation now would pay dividends for progressive 
entrepreneurs in a future, democratic Burma.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NLD LOOKING AHEAD TO CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM? 
 
REF: RANGOON 544 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.4 (B & D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Post has received some indications from NLD 
insiders that the party plans to focus its efforts on the 
constitutional referendum phase of the SPDC\'s road map. 
Rather than fight against terribly long odds at the 
stacked-deck National Convention, the party may feel its 
continuing mass appeal offers the best hope of turning back 
the regime\'s plan to frog-march Burma to a 
military-controlled \"disciplined democracy.\"  End Summary. 
 
2.  (S) Looking Ahead:  At our early May meeting with two NLD 
insiders and Aung San Suu Kyi confidants, the discussion did 
not dwell at all on the National Convention, but revolved 
around questions concerning constitutional referenda, 
including an urgent request for information directly from 
Aung San Suu Kyi.  One of our interlocutors said, \"What would 
happen if the referendum on the constitution failed? 
Wouldn\'t that be interesting?\" 
 
3.  (SBU) Doing the Math:  About thirty NLD members have 
received invitations to participate in the National 
Convention, as have six former members.  When the National 
Convention began in 1993 it had 702 participants.  Between 
700 and 900 invitations have been issued for May 17th, 
although some speculate the number of participants could go 
as high as 1,400.  We have been told that there will be no 
voting and all decisions will be by consensus.  With a 
maximum of 3.5% of the delegates, the NLD is not apt to carry 
the day.  The party must realize that the likelihood of an 
SPDC-backed draft constitution being approved is very high. 
 
4.  (SBU) Why Bother to Attend, Then?:  The NLD said it would 
attend the National Convention if three \"suggestions\" (not 
demands or conditions) were agreed to: A) release the two 
senior NLD leaders still under house arrest, B) open 210 
party offices, and C) set a firm timeline for the whole road 
map, as reported reftel.  Detailed concerns about National 
Convention procedures, which scuttled the 1993-96 effort, 
could be discussed in due course, the NLD allowed.  These 
three softball conditions have very little to do with the 
National Convention per se.  The NLD attended before when 
ASSK was under house arrest and prior to the 2002-03 opening 
of so many district offices.  The opening date of May 17 
seems firm.  So why make these suggestions rather than just 
attend or announce a boycott? 
 
5.  (C) Taking it to the People:  All three suggestions are 
vital for the NLD to have a chance of turning back the SPDC\'s 
road map at the constitutional referendum phase.  Aung San 
Suu Kyi and U Tin Oo need to be out and able to fire up the 
party faithful.  District and provincial offices are 
important for grass-roots coordination.  A fixed date means 
the SPDC can\'t procrastinate forever.  Thus, the three 
suggestions support the notion that the referendum, not the 
National Convention, is where the NLD may chose to make its 
stand.  The NLD will not be able to control the convention, 
but might hope to stun the regime with a show of support at 
the ballot box.  Will the regime allow a free and fair 
referendum vote?  Maybe so, maybe not, but if the junta 
cheats on the referendum vote, what chance does the planned 
general election have to be fair?  Better to find out now, 
perhaps. 
 
6.  (S) Comment:  The NLD as an organization is in bad shape. 
 Some previously stalwart Youth Wing leaders recently fled 
the country in despair.  There is no good reason for the 
regime to agree to the NLD\'s three suggestions, apart from a 
minimal need to have the road map process appear at least 
superficially inclusive.  Encouragingly, the regime has 
allowed the full NLD leadership to meet three times in the 
past fortnight, but it has not yet responded to the NLD\'s 
suggestions.  If the NLD\'s suggestions are not agreed to, 
Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD will have to review their policy 
of forbearance and patience.  If the three suggestions are 
agreed to, the party can gear up for a political fight on the 
referendum, while perhaps sitting passively through the 
National Convention.  This has the added advantage of kicking 
the NLD make-or-break point down the road another six months 
or so.  End Comment.

1.  (C) SUMMARY: UNHCR\'s first assessment mission into 
Burma\'s south-eastern border area in early April found a 
heavy presence of Burmese Army troops and a lack of the basic 
infrastructure needed to support the tens of thousands of 
refugees projected to eventually return from Thailand. 
Though UNHCR continues planning for refugee repatriation, a 
formal SPDC-KNU political settlement remains a precondition 
for any returns, which UNHCR now doesn\'t expect to begin 
until early 2005.  As for IDPs, a Rangoon-based Karen leader 
reports that if SPDC-KNU talks scheduled for late May are 
successful, Karen IDP resettlement could soon after begin in 
the Papun Township in eastern Karen State.  END SUMMARY. 
 
INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
2.  (C) Rangoon UNHCR Representative Rajiv Kapur told COM on 
April 8 that a UNHCR assessment team successfully surveyed 
three Karen townships in Tenasserim (Tanintharyi) Division in 
early April and determined that basic infrastructure needed 
to support the thousands of refugees that would return to 
that area was lacking.  Besides finding approximately 25,000 
Burmese Army troops garrisoned in the townships, in the 15 
village tracts around Tavoy (Dawei) the SPDC has designated 
for settling returning refugees there is no significant local 
economy and no drinking water, and health clinics will be 
unable to adequately address returnee health issues.  Though 
there are schools available, they have no furniture, books, 
or teachers.  However, the Tavoy army commander facilitated a 
very well organized trip for UNHCR, indicating to UNHCR the 
SPDC is taking the return of refugees and IDPs seriously. 
 
3.  (C)  Kapur described how 15 to 20 families had already 
spontaneously returned to the Tavoy area following the 
January SPDC-KNU verbal cease-fire agreement (ref A).  He 
said UNHCR won\'t be able tell the difference between a 
returning refugee and a returning IDP, and admitted that he 
didn\'t think UNHCR should have to make a distinction since 
the reason for flight was exactly the same.  Kapur also told 
us that according to the ICRC office in Tenasserim Division, 
the SPDC is not allowing IDPs and refugees to return to their 
original burned-out villages in what is now a no-man\'s land 
near the border.  The government is settling the returnees 
further into the interior next to military bases, which could 
expose them to forced labor and forced contribution abuses in 
the future.  Kapur forecast that the \"right of return\" to 
their original villages will become a main issue for UNHCR. 
 
4.  (C)  Help may be on the way.  A senior Karen community 
leader in Rangoon told us that Japan International 
Cooperation Agency (JICA) and World Concern presented a plan 
April 26 on regional development to upgrade infrastructure in 
the areas the Karen refugees will return to.  JICA\'s Rangoon 
representative said that JICA\'s Chairperson, Professor Ogata, 
has given her full support for infrastructure and social 
development in the Karen State.  However, the GOB has not yet 
approved JICA\'s MOU application to conduct road building, 
irrigation, agriculture, malaria, and HIV/AIDS programs. 
 
EFFECT FROM SPDC-KNU DELAY 
 
5.  (C) Regarding the recently postponed SPDC-KNU talks (ref 
A), Kapur later told Poloff UNHCR has made it very clear all 
along that an SPDC-KNU settlement is a precondition for any 
refugee repatriations.  He added that the GOB hasn\'t asked 
UNHCR to begin any repatriations to date, and \"from the UNHCR 
perspective that is fine because the earliest returns would 
be no sooner than early in 2005.\"  Because of the lack of 
roads in the area and daunting logistics required, 
repatriations will have to be to only two or three areas at a 
time.  For example, repatriating the 9,000 refugees to Tavoy 
requires bringing them from Thailand by sea.  UNHCR will 
conduct a second assessment trip to the border area (COMMENT: 
Probably in eastern Karen State) in the near future, and is 
planning activities aimed at improving the situation for the 
population as a whole. 
 
MEANWHILE, 100,000 IDPs IN THE WINGS... 
 
6.  (C) A Rangoon-based Karen religious leader reported that 
if an agreement is made during the next round of SPDC-KNU 
talks, Karen church groups will draw up a detailed 
resettlement plan for Karen IDPs, with the first returns 
going to Papun Township in eastern Karen State.  The Karen 
leader said Karen religious groups had registered 100,000 
Christian Karen IDPs inside the Burmese border. 
 
7.  (C) COMMENT:  Once an SPDC-KNU settlement is agreed, the 
gate could open for a large influx of refugees and IDPs 
wanting to return to what are now economically stagnant and 
infrastructure-poor areas in Karen State, Mon State, and 
Tenasserim Division.  The UNHCR assessment missions over the 
next several months, and NGO funding currently under 
consideration, will do much to help prepare for possible 
returns.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) Summary:  According to top NLD leaders, as of May 12 
the SPDC has not responded to NLD \"suggestions\" put forth two 
weeks ago that would improve the political environment and 
allow the party to attend the regime\'s forthcoming reconvened 
National Convention.  Registration for the Convention will 
take place on May 13-14, which has given rise to rumors and 
speculation that GOB authorities will respond positively at 
any moment to the NLD suggestions, which include the release 
of party leaders ASSK and U Tin Oo and the opening of party 
offices.  However, there are no visible signs that the SPDC 
intends to respond at all.  NLD officials say they will wait 
until the close of registration on May 14 for a response from 
the regime, at which time the party plans to release a 
statement addressing their participation in the Convention. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On the eve of the registration period (May 13-14) for 
the regime\'s imminent National Convention, Rangoon is rife 
with rumors and speculation regarding the status of detained 
NLD leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and U Tin Oo, as well as the 
opposition party\'s intentions with regard to participation in 
the Convention. 
 
3. (C) We met briefly on May 12 with several NLD CEC members, 
including party spokesman U Lwin, Chairman U Aung Shwe, and U 
Nyunt Wei.  The latter reported that the NLD has to date 
heard no response from the SPDC to the party\'s \"suggestions\" 
(conditions) for participation in the Convention (ref B).  U 
Nyunt Wei added that the NLD has also received no overtures 
from GOB authorities for a dialogue with NLD leaders on 
Convention issues or other substantive political matters. 
 
4. (C) U Lwin said that the NLD planned to wait until the 
evening of Friday May 14, following closure of registration 
for the Convention, for a response from the SPDC.  At that 
time, with or without a response from authorities, the NLD, 
he said, plans to issue a statement expressing its official 
stance on participation.  U Lwin suggested that the closure 
of registration on May 14 is not the final opportunity for 
the party to decide on participation, intimating that the NLD 
may in fact have additional leeway given that the first three 
days of the Convention (May 17-19) will be reserved for 
sundry ceremonial and housekeeping procedures. 
 
5. (C) U Lwin acknowledged that many pro-democracy ethnic 
political parties were waiting for the NLD to declare a final 
position on participation before making their own 
determinations.  He said that the NLD planned to communicate 
with the ethnic parties at an appropriate time, but the party 
leadership was still deliberating on an appropriate mechanism 
and venue.  U Lwin observed that the NLD would not provoke 
the regime by meeting openly with the leading ethnic 
political coalition, the UNA, whose members included many 
banned parties.  However, he added, the NLD would likely 
convoke the Committee to Represent the People\'s Parliament 
(CRPP), slightly more palatable to the regime, for a joint 
meeting at NLD headquarters. 
 
6. (C) Comment: According to NLD sources, the party\'s top 
four leaders (including ASSK and U Tin Oo) met again as a 
group on May 8 and may have also held subsequent meetings. 
Despite U Nyunt Wei\'s information that GOB authorities have 
not pursued a dialogue with the NLD, there have been reports 
that SPDC envoys continue to meet privately with ASSK. 
Regardless of what meetings may have taken place, there is 
scant information available on the regime\'s intentions 
regarding the NLD\'s requests and no visible signs that the 
SPDC is actively preparing to release ASSK or U Tin Oo or to 
allow the NLD to reopen upcountry offices.  End comment.

1. (S) NLD spokesman U Lwin requested a meeting with P/E 
chief on May 13 and reported that he had met the previous 
evening with ASSK.  He conveyed to ASSK the Embassy\'s 
oft-repeated offer to assist her and the NLD in any way 
possible.  ASSK, who was \"delighted and very encouraged\" by 
the USG\'s continuing support, requested that U Lwin share 
with us the following: 
 
--ASSK has recently held a number of secret, but productive, 
meetings with SPDC envoys, including Minister of Home Affairs 
Colonel Tin Hlaing and OCMI deputy chief Major General Kyaw 
Win, and the regime has agreed with many of the NLD\'s 
demands.  For example, if the NLD agrees to attend the 
National Convention, the party will be allowed to choose its 
own delegates, which could include members who are currently 
under arrest.  The regime has also agreed, in principle, to 
allow the reopening of NLD offices, but only on a gradual 
basis and commencing after the conclusion of the Convention. 
 
--On the NLD\'s most important requirement, the release of 
ASSK and U Tin Oo, the SPDC refuses to budge.  ASSK met with 
Tin Hlaing and Kyaw Win on May 12 and, according to U Lwin, 
\"she had a very tough time.\"  Although the two envoys have 
undertaken many recent efforts \"to try and please ASSK and 
the NLD, they were extremely rigid on the issue of releases.\" 
 
--The NLD will not attend the Convention unless ASSK and U 
Tin Oo are released.  U Lwin allowed that the SPDC might 
commit to releasing the two after the Convention is over, 
\"but that would be unacceptable.\"  He added that ASSK is not 
looking out for her own well being, but demands to be 
released on principle so her party can participate in the 
Convention process.  U Lwin also noted that SPDC envoys have 
ignored the fate of U Tin Oo in these discussions and focused 
exclusively on ASSK, a source of irritation to the NLD 
leaders. 
 
--It is abundantly clear to NLD leaders that on the question 
of releasing ASSK there is a division within the senior ranks 
of the SPDC.  He described SPDC Chairman Than Shwe as 
representing \"the hard-line\" which is worried that ASSK would 
pursue the May 2003 Depeyin attack with the media were she to 
be released.  U Lwin noted that Home Minister Tin Hlaing 
represented Than Shwe\'s rigid stance on ASSK\'s release, while 
Kyaw Win (who reports directly to Prime Minister Khin Nyunt) 
has been somewhat flexible. 
 
--ASSK expects to meet again with SPDC envoys late on the 
evening of May 13.  If the envoys do not have good news on 
releasing her and U Tin Oo, ASSK will demand a definitive 
answer from the SPDC no later than Saturday May 15. 
 
2. (S) U Lwin said he \"hopes for the best, but expects the 
worst.\"  He believed that if the regime refuses to release 
ASSK and U Tin Oo, and the NLD in turn declines to attend the 
Convention, military intelligence could immediately place 
members of the NLD CEC back under house arrest.  Should this 
scenario unfold, U Lwin said that he would instruct an 
intermediary to deliver a statement to the U.S. Embassy and 
several trusted international media stringers expressing NLD 
views on the situation.  ASSK, he said, suggested that the 
USG \"do whatever it thought was practical with such a 
statement.\"  U Lwin added that the NLD would welcome any 
suggestions from the USG on next steps \"should this worst 
case scenario emerge.\" 
 
3. (S) Comment: NLD leaders have been very cautious in their 
recent interactions with Emboffs and other diplomatic 
missions, clearly not wanting to derail ongoing negotiations 
with the SPDC.  However, now that the eleventh hour 
approaches on the May 17 reconvening of the National 
Convention, the NLD may soon desire a boost from friends and 
supporters outside the country--should negotiations collapse 
and the party\'s situation deteriorate further.  If the SPDC 
gives in, however, there may be a different outcome 
altogether.

1. (C) Summary:  The NLD, failing to secure the release of 
party leaders ASSK and U Tin Oo, declared publicly on May 14 
that the party will not attend the SPDC\'s National 
Convention.  Burma\'s leading pro-democracy ethnic coalition 
will follow suit.  However, NLD leaders allow that if the 
regime chooses to continue bilateral negotiations, the NLD 
would be prepared to listen.  Given that further 
clarification is unlikely prior to May 17, we advise that in 
the interim the Department continue calls for the release of 
NLD leaders and for all parties to be allowed to participate 
in the reconciliation process, but refrain from direct 
commentary on the National Convention itself.  End comment. 
 
2. (U) The National League for Democracy (NLD), at a dramatic 
May 14 press conference, declared publicly that the party 
will not participate in the SPDC\'s National Convention, 
scheduled to reconvene on May 17.  The press conference was 
attended by international media stringers, over two hundred 
NLD supporters, numerous ethnic party leaders, and several 
diplomats, including COM and representatives from the 
British, French, German, Italian, and Japanese embassies. 
 
3. (U) NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe read a brief statement at the 
conference and stated that the NLD had strongly desired to 
attend the Convention and had offered the SPDC \"minimal 
conditions\" for NLD participation.  He said that the NLD had 
achieved an agreement with the regime on the right of 
political parties to choose their own delegates to the 
Convention and made limited progress on allowing debate and 
discussion on substantive portions of the draft constitution. 
 However, he said that SPDC authorities had not clarified how 
they would implement free debate at the Convention, nor had 
they agreed to open NLD offices immediately or release NLD 
Vice Chairman U Tin Oo and General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 
4. (U) U Aung Shwe concluded his statement, to thunderous 
applause from party members and supporters, by saying that 
\"the NLD does not believe it will be able to benefit the 
nation by participating; therefore, it has been decided that 
the NLD will not attend the National Convention.\" 
 
5. (C) Following the reading of statement, P/E chief talked 
briefly with Hkun Htun Oo, leader of the SNLD and chairman of 
the United Nationalities Alliance (UNA) coalition of 
pro-democracy ethnic parties, who joined a joint UNA-NLD 
meeting after the press conference.  Asked what approach the 
pro-democracy ethnics parties would take to the question of 
participation in the Convention, Hkun Htun Oo stated \"the 
same as the NLD.\" 
 
6. (C) NLD leaders tell us that they issued their statement 
on the basis that registration for the Convention closed 
today, May 14.  However, COM also spoke with NLD CEC members 
U Lwin and U Nyunt Wei who intimated that the NLD was 
engaging in a game of brinkmanship with the regime.  They 
allowed that if the regime signaled its intent to talk over 
the weekend, the NLD would be prepared to listen.  \"The 
Convention doesn\'t begin for three days,\" said U Nyunt Wei, 
\"the ball is now in (the regime\'s) court.\" 
 
7. (C) Comment: Although the NLD statement was unambiguous, 
several scenarios could unfold over the coming days.  The 
SPDC will plow ahead with the Convention and has no intention 
of postponing opening ceremonies on May 17.  However, a 
boycott by the NLD and the leading ethnic parties poses a 
serious challenge to the regime\'s road map.  Authorities 
could respond with a renewed crackdown on the democratic 
opposition (ref A), or they could continue quiet negotiations 
to entice NLD and UNA participation.  Given that further 
clarification is unlikely prior to May 17, we advise that in 
the interim the Department continue calls for the release of 
NLD leaders and for all parties to be allowed to participate 
in the reconciliation process, but refrain from direct 
commentary on the National Convention itself.  End comment.

SUBJECT: SPDC REJECTS CEASE-FIRE GROUPS\' NC APPEAL 
 
REF: RANGOON 600 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen M. Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The SPDC rejected an 11th hour appeal from 
Burma\'s eight largest cease-fire groups on May 12 to allow 
free discussions during the National Convention.  The SPDC\'s 
reported response on May 13 stated the Prime Minister is 
upset the cease-fire groups don\'t want the military involved 
in the political process.  The PM pointed out that in fact 
the military will only be a minority of 100 in the new 
400-member parliament.  In the end, on May 14 the cease-fire 
groups headed off to the convention site as planned.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) Eight cease-fire groups submitted a joint letter May 
12 to the Chairman of the National Convention Convening 
Commission, Secretary-1 Lt Gen Thein Sein, asking for 
amendment of the draft constitution\'s six political 
objectives, which they described as \"unsuited for the 
peoples\' wishes for a democratic process.\"  The letter also 
asked for amendment of the 104 principles, which they see as 
\"incompatible with democratic reforms,\" and for the promise 
of free discussion with any individual or organization during 
the upcoming National Convention. 
 
3.  (C) In reply, Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt 
reportedly sent the SPDC\'s chief ethnic armed group 
negotiator Col San Pwint to tell the cease-fire groups that 
the Prime Minister is \"upset\" that the cease-fire groups want 
the military to stay out of politics, especially after he has 
done so much for them.  The PM believes the letter was \"not 
written intentionally,\" and feels there is a misunderstanding 
regarding the military\'s role in politics.  The PM\'s envoy 
claimed that with just 100 out of the 400 seats in the 
parliament, the military will only have a minority platform 
in politics.  The Prime Minister hoped the cease-fire groups 
would remain within the good graces of the government. 
 
4.  (C)  COMMENT: In the early afternoon on May 14 the 
cease-fire groups, despite their misgivings about procedures, 
made their way to the Convention site prepared to participate 
on May 17.  They continue to aspire to overturn the six 
objectives and 104 principles, or at least to fix a timeline 
for phasing the military out of the legislature and 
government.  However, without the participation of the NLD 
and the SNLD (ref), there are far fewer critical voices to 
add to theirs.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) Summary:  Leon de Reidmatten (LDR), UN Special Envoy 
Razali\'s \"man in Rangoon\" told COM that up until May 12, NLD 
leaders believed that an agreement had been reached to allow 
the party to participate in the National Convention.  Despite 
the NLD\'s May 14 announcement that they would not 
participate, LDR believes there is still a very faint 
possibility of a compromise.  LDR said that Prime Minister 
Khin Nyunt is now \"very weak\" and unable to deliver on his 
long-standing promises of a meeting between ASSK and the \"Big 
Three\" of the SPDC.  He said the current impasse demonstrates 
that Senior General Than Shwe has a firm grip on power and 
little or no intention to enter into a real dialog with the 
opposition.  On the subject of SE Razali, LDR believes Razali 
still wants to travel to Rangoon soon and knows that the SE 
will need to come prepared to overcome the NLD\'s perception 
that he is asking more from it than from the SPDC in the way 
of compromise.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) COM met with UN Special Envoy Razali\'s \"man in 
Rangoon,\" Leon de Reidmatten, on the morning of Monday, April 
17.  De Reidmatten, a close confidante of Aung San Suu Kyi, 
said he was surprised on Friday, May 14, when the National 
League for Democracy announced (Ref A) it would not 
participate in the National Convention (NC).  According to 
LDR, up until Wednesday, May 12, ASSK and the other NLD 
leaders believed, based on their talks with SPDC 
interlocutors (the Minister of Home Affairs and the Minister 
of Labor), that the following agreement had been reached 
which would have allowed the party to participate in the NC: 
the two remaining senior NLD party leaders, ASSK and U Tin 
Oo, would be released from house arrest before the opening of 
the NC; the NLD offices could reopen; and the NLD would be 
allowed to select 54 delegates to the NC. 
 
3. (C) However, LDR said he had not known before the May 14 
press conference that the compromise fell apart on Thursday 
night, May 13, when the SPDC interlocutors advised the NLD 
that Senior General Than Shwe refused to approve it.  The 
regime\'s best offer would be for ASSK and U Tin Oo to remain 
under house arrest and NLD branch party offices would remain 
closed, but the opportunity for the NLD to name delegates to 
the NC apparently remains on the table.  LDR said that the 
SPDC representatives tried to assuage ASSK by praising her 
past cooperative attitude (saying she was \"so dutiful\") and 
then tried to get her to instruct the NLD to participate 
under these obviously unacceptable conditions. 
 
4. (C) According to LDR, ASSK could not accept the terms 
offered the night of May 13, and the NLD announced its 
non-participation on the morning of May 14.  Shortly 
afterwards, LDR was approached by regime representatives and 
asked to try and get the NLD to compromise and participate in 
the NC.  LDR said he told the regime representatives he would 
not make an approach to the NLD unless he could propose the 
following:  the regime would set a date, preferably within a 
few weeks, for the release of ASSK and U Tin Oo; the regime 
would provide a firm timeline for the reopening of NLD branch 
offices; and the NLD would be allowed to freely name 54 
delegates to the NC.  Only under these conditions would he 
propose to the NLD the idea of participating in the NC while 
ASSK and U Tin Oo remain under house arrest and the NLD 
offices remain closed.  The regime envoys agreed and then he 
discussed the terms with NLD spokesman U Lwin on Saturday. 
By that same evening U Lwin advised him that ASSK and the NLD 
leadership were amenable to the compromise (terms of which 
had apparently been floated before). However, as of the 
morning of May 17, LDR says he has not been contacted further 
by the regime and does not believe the NLD has received a 
response to the compromise offer. 
 
5. (C) LDR feels that there is still a very faint glimmer of 
hope that the regime might see the light.  He praised the 
restraint shown in the Department\'s and the UNSYG\'s 
statements over the weekend regarding the state of the NC 
process.  He feels there are still face-saving ways the 
regime could accept the compromise offer and allow the NLD to 
participate, despite missing the NC opening ceremonies today. 
 The regime could claim that the first week, or even two, was 
being devoted to administrative and logistical matters, or 
that the start of monsoon season had delayed the arrival of 
other delegates, or could manufacture a host of other excuses 
for allowing the NLD\'s late entry into the NC. 
 
6. (C) LDR also said that ASSK was frustrated that the regime 
did not believe her assurances that she would not press too 
soon for an investigation of the May 30, 2003, Depeyin attack 
(Note: ASSK told UN Special Rapporteur Pinheiro on his last 
visit in November 2003 that there was a need for restraint on 
this matter, see Ref B.  End Note).  LDR said that ASSK knows 
there are those in her party that could be considered 
\"hardliners\" who want to use May 30 against the regime, but 
that she can control them and will take full responsibility 
for the party\'s actions if she is released. 
 
7. (C) In reference to the cease-fire groups that are 
participating in the NC, LDR said that he thought the SPDC 
would have a tough time handling them and keeping them in the 
process if they stick to their demands for amendment of the 
SPDC\'s six political objectives (Ref C).  He felt the 
cease-fire groups\' demands were tougher than the three 
\"suggestions\" the NLD conveyed to the SPDC in late April (see 
Ref D). 
 
8. (C) LDR said he had not spoken to SE Razali today, but he 
felt that the SE still wants to come to Burma soon.  LDR said 
he was wrestling with developing recommendations for what 
approach the SE should take if another visit is allowed by 
the regime.  COM reminded LDR that she, the Australian, and 
the U.K. COM\'s had told LDR that the NLD felt like the 
international community and the SE were asking the NLD to 
make all the compromises and hoped that the SE understood 
that the NLD needed to be reassured that equal pressure was 
being placed on the SPDC.  LDR said he was also aware of the 
NLD\'s sentiments and would emphasize this to the SE. 
 
9. (C) The meeting concluded on a down beat note - LDR said 
that Prime Minister Khin Nyuent is \"very weak\" and unable to 
deliver on his long-standing promise of a meeting between 
ASSK and the \"Big Three\" - Senior General Than Shwe, General 
Maung Aye, and the Prime Minister himself.  In LDR\'s view, 
the current impasse demonstrates that the Senior General has 
a firm grip on power and little or no intention of entering 
into a real dialog with the opposition. 
 
10. (C) Comment:  Although the recent events are highly 
discouraging, we agree with LDR\'s assessment that there could 
still be a very faint possibility of a compromise that would 
allow NLD participation in the NC (FYI: COM was told by one 
of the COM\'s that attended the opening of the National 
Convention this morning that Deputy Foreign Minister Win Aung 
told a small group of COM\'s at the ceremony that procedurally 
it would be difficult for the NLD to participate at this late 
date, but that a political decision to allow their 
participation could be a possibility. End FYI).  On the 
subject of Razali, if he should be allowed back in by the 
regime, he will need to come prepared to overcome the NLD\'s 
perception that he is asking more than they can continue to 
give in the way of further compromise with the SPDC.  End

1. (C) Summary:  The Burmese regime\'s National Convention 
reconvened on May 17 with over 1,000 hand-picked delegates in 
attendance, but without the participation of the NLD and the 
UNA nor the presence of the U.S. and EU missions.  The NLD, 
on the basis that its existing demands are reasonable and 
that SPDC Chairman Than Shwe shows no signs of relenting on 
the release of ASSK, sees little room for a late compromise 
that would allow NLD participation in the Convention.  The UN 
Special Envoy has not abandoned hope, however, and we should 
continue to support UN efforts aimed at a compromise. 
However, if by the end of this week the SPDC continues to 
charge ahead without the democratic opposition, we should 
call a spade a spade and denounce the Convention process. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On May 17, the SPDC reconvened the National Convention 
for the purpose of drafting, as attempted without success in 
1993-1996, a \"firm and enduring Constitution.\"  Noticeably 
absent from opening ceremonies at the isolated \"Nyaunghnapin\" 
(Two Banyon Trees) Camp north of Rangoon were the NLD and 
members of the United Nationalities Alliance (UNA) ethnic 
party coalition (ref B).  The GOB also invited diplomatic 
missions to participate in the opening ceremonies; those who 
declined the invitation included the U.S., EU members, and 
Israel missions. 
 
3. (SBU) The opening day of the Convention was devoid of 
substantive discussions and invited dignitaries were 
shepherded around the Convention site, a tightly-controlled 
USDA training center, to view the recently refurbished 
facilities, including gift shops and a golf driving range. 
According to several participants, 1,076 registered delegates 
were present to kick off the Convention.  Military 
intelligence transported most delegates by bus on May 13-14 
and authorities advised delegates that they would stay at the 
Convention site for at least two months and would only be 
allowed to depart on weekends with \"special permission.\" 
 
4. (U) In an unusual statement issued on May 14, the GOB 
acknowledged the NLD non-participation and observed that the 
party had decided not to attend because the NLD \"has no faith 
in the National Convention\" and because \"U Tin Oo and Daw 
Aung San Suu Kyi are not able to travel freely and the NLD is 
still unable to reopen its offices.\"  In that same statement, 
the GOB said it had asked the NLD leaders to \"wait patiently\" 
(under house arrest) while the government gave \"priority to 
stability and peace.\" 
 
5. (C) We met with NLD spokesman U Lwin on May 17 at NLD 
headquarters, where authorities had apparently cut the 
party\'s phone lines earlier in the day.  U Lwin affirmed that 
UN Special Envoy Razali, through his Rangoon-based 
intermediary Leon de Riedmatten, had approached NLD leaders 
with a view to helping continue negotiations between the SPDC 
and the NLD (ref A).  U Lwin said that there was little to 
discuss, given: a) that the NLD had already demonstrated 
great flexibility, even to the point of being willing to 
begin the Convention on the basis of promised dates from the 
regime for the future release of ASSK and U Tin Oo and for 
the future reopening of NLD offices; and b) that SPDC envoys 
had indicated Senior General Than Shwe was dead set against 
releasing ASSK (ref A). 
 
6. (C) U Lwin welcomed the Department\'s May 14 statement, and 
noted the party\'s ire over the regime\'s desire to accommodate 
the cease-fire groups, \"who used to shoot at the Burmese 
army,\" but not negotiate with the peaceful NLD.  U Lwin said 
that the real focus should now be on the United Nations and 
Kofi Annan.  The UNSYG, U Lwin said, \"is the man for the 
moment and he has the responsibility to follow through on his 
pronouncements (that Burma should be democratic by 2006).\"  U 
Lwin said that the UNSYG needed an effective envoy for the 
job, observing that \"Razali, like (senior UN official and 
former envoy) de Soto before him, has failed.\" 
 
7. (C) The NLD and others must now contend with a possible 
regime crack down on parties which are boycotting the 
Convention by invoking \"Law Number 5/96,\" a decree issued by 
SPDC Chairman Than Shwe in 1996 following the departure of 
the NLD from the first Convention.  Under that draconian law, 
individuals and organizations are prohibited from delivering 
unauthorized speeches or statements about the National 
Convention or the draft Constitution.  Violators, including 
those who refuse an invitation to attend the Convention, are 
subject to up to 20 years imprisonment and their 
organizations can be declared unlawful.  SNLD leader Hkun 
Htun Oo declined to speak with Emboffs on May 17 and an 
intermediary said the UNA chairman was \"laying low\" over fear 
of arrest. 
 
Comment:  What Next? 
-------------------- 
 
8. (C) The Department\'s statement of May 14 effectively 
brought attention to the NLD\'s (and the UNA\'s) decision to 
boycott the Convention, the regime\'s failure to improve the 
political environment, and the need for substantive 
discussions.  We note that UNSYG Kofi Annan took a similar 
approach and also allowed that there may be additional time 
for the parties concerned to reach an agreement.  As of May 
17, the opportunity for further negotiations appears to be 
very slim, although the next few days will likely be reserved 
for little more than logistical housekeeping at the 
Convention.  Given that the UN has not yet abandoned hope for 
a compromise, the most helpful role for the U.S. may be to 
protect what little space exists by continuing to draw 
attention to the regime\'s long-standing promise to release 
all original Depeyin detainees (only ASSK and U Tin Oo remain 
in detention) and to reopen NLD party offices (returning to 
the status quo prior to May 30, 2003). 
 
9. (C) However, if by the end of this week there are no signs 
that the SPDC intends to budge, we would advise a 
hard-hitting statement that dismisses the utility of a 
constitutional-drafting process that excludes representatives 
who have a legitimate claim to represent the majority of the 
Burmese people (the NLD and the UNA member parties won a 
combined 89% of the seats in the 1990 legislative elections). 
 Without an open, deliberative, and participatory National 
Constitution, the regime\'s road map lacks any credibility as 
a plan for a transition to democracy.  End Comment.

REF: A. RANGOON 223 
     B. RANGOON 34 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s military and its economic tentacles 
are apparently benefiting from the GOB\'s January freeze on 
private sector rice exports, buying up thousands of tons at 
discount prices.  Though the purchases are good for farmers 
who were stuck with massive surpluses when private exporters 
stopped buying, the freeze and the evident return of 
government participation in the rice markets may be the death 
knell for the short-lived policy that freed the rice trade in 
2003 from 40 years of government control.  End summary. 
 
\"Temporary\" Ban: Day 163 
 
2. (C) Private sector exports of rice, liberalized after 40 
years with much fanfare in March 2003, were abruptly 
\"suspended\" in January 2004 (ref B) leaving in the lurch many 
exporters -- some with contracts already signed.  Though the 
GOB announced at the time the ban was only \"temporary,\" to 
date there has been silence as to when the restrictions might 
be lifted. 
 
3. (C) The ostensible justification for the export freeze was 
a fear that domestic supply would dwindle below demand. 
Publicly the government cited a possible spike in demand 
following the January announcement that rice subsidies to 
civil servants would be replaced with a 5,000 kyat monthly 
stipend (ref A).  Privately, rice traders and economists told 
us the government was fearful because its poor statistics and 
controls meant there were no reliable accounts of how much 
rice was in GOB warehouses or what domestic consumption 
really was.  In either event, the already low domestic price 
for paddy in early 2004 -- about US$117 per 100 baskets 
(about 2.5 tons) -- remained stable, and even sank slightly 
in the aftermath of the export ban and the civil servant 
compensation reform. 
 
4. (C) With domestic prices cheap and stable, the GOB, always 
in need of foreign exchange, should have been comfortable to 
lift the ban.  However, the private sector remains frozen 
out.  There have been no legal exports of rice since January 
-- not even for barter trade deals.  According to reliable 
sources with firsthand knowledge of rice exports, in FY 
2003-04 (April-March), only 80,000 metric tons of rice were 
legally exported.  For comparison, in FY 2002-03 roughly 
700,000 metric tons of rice were legally exported. 
Transportation of rice domestically toward the border areas 
is outlawed, though much is smuggled out across the borders 
to Bangladesh and China anyway.  Recent sales to World Food 
Programme projects have come from the GOB\'s stocks, set aside 
in theory to meet its ASEAN buffer requirement. 
 
Military Feasts While Exporters Starve 
 
5. (C) According to several rice industry sources, the GOB 
has not re-opened exports in order to give the military a 
chance to fill its granaries while domestic prices are cheap 
and also to allow the military\'s two \"private\" companies 
(Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd. (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic 
Corporation (MEC)) to build up stockpiles that can later be 
exported for a large profit.  According to one knowledgeable 
commodities broker, the military has purchased more than 35 
million baskets of paddy (about 800,000 tons) from local rice 
traders -- far more than is needed to feed the troops. 
 
Production and Prices Unclear 
 
6. (C) In the short term, this massive military purchasing 
has had a beneficial impact for farmers, driving domestic 
prices up nearly 20 percent to around US$140 per 100 baskets 
of paddy (around 2.5 tons).  This is still far lower than it 
has been in recent years, but is considered the break-even 
point for most producers.  However, the chaos and insecurity 
caused by the GOB\'s gyrating rice policies will likely lead 
to reduced supply next season as farmers err on the side of 
caution.  The dry season area under cultivation was smaller 
than usual, and agriculture insiders are predicting a sharp 
year-on-year drop in plantings for the larger monsoon crop. 
This combined with too much or too little rain could squeeze 
supply when the main harvest occurs at the end of the year. 
Fortunately any supply problems will be mitigated somewhat by 
the domestic surpluses remaining from the 2003 monsoon 
harvest due to unmet expectations of exporter demand. 
 
Comment: Burma\'s New Private Sector 
 
7. (C) The direction of the GOB\'s ever evolving rice policy 
is troubling.  The regime, getting cold feet at the prospect 
of losing control of the politically sensitive rice market, 
is apparently swapping the old monopoly exporter Myanmar 
Agricultural Products Trading (MAPT) for new monopolists MEC 
and MEHL.  More insidious, however, is the fact the SPDC will 
claim these two firms are private (they are owned in part by 
individual military shareholders) and thus the policy of 
private rice exports has not changed.  Given their good head 
start, MEC and MEHL will destroy genuine private sector 
competitors when the export market is finally re-opened to 
\"free\" trade.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary: Anti-money laundering legislation and 
supervision were the topics of three days of discussions 
between FATF and the Burmese government.  Though the GOB has 
made much progress on paper, concerns remain over some 
troubling details and prospects for proper enforcement.  As 
FATF considers Burma\'s status, we urge a tough line on 
lifting countermeasures.  However, while pressuring the 
country\'s policymakers we should be finding creative ways to 
encourage Burma\'s law enforcers who, though badly outmatched, 
demonstrate the will to take on money laundering activities. 
End summary. 
 
Burma on the FATF Hot Seat 
 
2. (U) Based on Burma\'s failure to adequately address 15 of 
25 specific Financial Action Task Force (FATF) areas of 
concern, FATF declared Burma a \"Non-Cooperative Country or 
Territory\" in 2001.  (Note: the number of failing grades has 
subsequently been reduced to nine.)  In 2003, because of a 
lack of required anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and 
a mutual legal assistance (MLA) law, the FATF called on its 
members to impose additional countermeasures against Burma. 
Since then, the GOB has issued both the regulations and the 
MLA law. 
 
3. (SBU) During an unprecedented May 10-12 closed-door 
meeting, GOB finance and legal officials explained Burma\'s 
new AML regulations and MLA law and answered tough questions 
from a visiting FATF delegation.  An official of Japan\'s 
financial intelligence unit co-chaired the sessions, and 
delegations from the U.S. Treasury Department, the Australian 
Federal Police, and UNODC also attended.  Encouragingly, the 
GOB sent knowledgeable working-level officials to the 
meetings.  They were forthcoming and unusually willing and 
eager to pass on whatever documentation and information they 
could.  With a few important exceptions, the GOB delegates 
responded frankly, with inadequate or vague answers seemingly 
due to a lack of technical knowledge or the authority to 
respond authoritatively. 
 
Several Problem Areas Remain 
 
4. (C) Though the FATF delegation acknowledged the GOB\'s 
efforts thus far, there remain several technical or systemic 
problems.  Among these are: 
 
-- (1) a complete failure thus far by banks and real estate 
brokers to submit any suspicious transaction reports 
(although several hundred large-cash transaction reports have 
so far been submitted to anti-money laundering authorities); 
-- (2) an unusually high threshold limit for bank reporting 
(100 million kyat -- roughly US$117,000); 
-- (3) zero progress thus far in investigating two private 
banks (Asia Wealth and Myanmar Mayflower) known for their 
ties to narcotics-related money laundering (ref B); 
-- (4) inadequate measures by the Central Bank to ensure 
criminals do not own banks; 
-- (5) the inability to close a loophole that allows 
unsupervised \"non-bank financial institutions\" to operate 
legally and freely (refs C and D); 
-- (6) the failure to include \"fraud\" as a predicate offense 
for anti-money laundering action.  (Note: the GOB argued that 
in Burma fraud monetary values were too small to merit money 
laundering investigations.  The failure of last year\'s 
multi-million dollar pyramid schemes (ref D) contradicts 
this); 
-- (7) a troubling clause in the new mutual legal assistance 
law that allows \"the Government\" to overrule, without giving 
justification, decisions made by the body established to 
adjudicate assistance requests; and, 
-- (8) the questionable legal status of the MLA.  While the 
GOB claims that this legislation is \"in force,\" it would 
appear that further implementing regulations are needed. 
 
5. (C) An Embassy-sponsored meeting for the visiting Treasury 
officials with local bankers, economists, realtors, and 
economic journalists illuminated the mismatch between what 
GOB financial authorities say, what the law requires, and 
what actually happens.  Inadequate resources, a lack of 
knowledge, corruption, and rampant tax evasion all conspire 
to make oversight of banks and real estate transactions very 
difficult.  In addition, an interesting theme emerged that in 
Burma and its informal economy money laundering is systemic 
and omnipresent, not a fringe behavior that can be easily 
monitored and eradicated.  One very intelligent and 
internationally savvy economist present even argued that in 
the short run money laundering might be a good thing since 
there are no other sources of investment capital in Burma at 
the moment. 
 
Japanese Push for \"A Way Out\" 
 
6. (C) Unfortunately, the FATF co-chair from Japan and the 
GOJ delegation seemed more interested in helping Burma \"find 
a way out of the situation\" than dispassionately assessing 
the regime\'s efforts thus far.  This position is far closer 
to that presented by the Japanese Embassy in Rangoon than to 
that presented in recent FATF plenary sessions.  Though the 
Australians had representatives at the meetings, he did not 
make any interventions or pose any questions. 
 
Comment: Next Steps Will be Crucial 
 
7. (C) FATF\'s Asia Review Group will meet Burma on June 13 in 
Korea.  The FATF plenary will also meet in Paris from June 28 
to July 2.  From our standpoint, it\'s important to recognize 
Burma\'s progress and response to international pressure. 
However, as for lifting countermeasures, FATF should hold 
Burma to an exacting standard since it is evident that the 
SPDC will call the tune on Burma\'s AML efforts regardless of 
what\'s written on paper.  A strong case for continued 
countermeasures can made on existing deficiencies in the 
mutual legal assistance framework.  Likewise, as the only 
multilateral sanction in place on Burma, the FATF 
countermeasures should be held in place as long as is 
justifiable.  This being said, we urge again (ref A) 
consideration of some kind of USG information sharing or 
indirect capacity building to assist those at the GOB working 
level who honestly want to enforce the new laws.  End comment. 
 
8. (U) This cable has been cleared with the Treasury 
delegation.

1. (C) Summary:  The Burmese regime\'s National Convention has 
thus far revealed little more than instructions and warnings 
to its hand-picked delegates who will have no opportunity to 
reconsider pre-drafted components of a new constitution.  It 
is clear that the SPDC has reconvened the Convention simply 
to rubber stamp a new constitution as the first step toward a 
military-controlled \"disciplined democracy.\"  The generals 
seem to view the boycott by the NLD and the UNA as a mere 
irritant, given an attending cast of delegates that will 
bless the entire process.  Although the more restive 
cease-fire groups in attendance could create some minor 
drama, the SPDC has no intention of letting this version of 
the National Convention spin out of its control.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The SPDC\'s National Convention nears completion of 
its first week in session and GOB authorities, as 
anticipated, show no signs of allowing open debate or 
reconsideration of pre-drafted components for a new 
constitution.  The new constitution, once \"approved\" by the 
1,000-plus hand-picked delegates, will allow the armed forces 
to retain a preeminent role in the governance of Burma. 
 
3. (U) According to official reports, 1,076 delegates are in 
attendance at the Convention, or as the GOB puts it, \"98.9 
percent of the 1,088 (registered) delegates.\"  Although the 
regime categorizes over 60 percent of the delegates as 
representatives of Burma\'s ethnic nationalities, many of 
these pro-regime delegates are identified as members of 
obscure social organizations and unknown political splinter 
groups (e.g., the \"KNPP Dragon Group,\" the \"Homein Region 
Welfare and Development Group,\" the \"Rahkine Group of the 
Burma Communist Party,\" etc.) 
 
4. (SBU) The regime has emphasized that the delegates 
represent a broad spectrum of Burmese society; however, only 
25 delegates represent political parties and a mere 12 
delegates are members-elect of Parliament, from among the 485 
MPs elected in 1990 (Note: Among the MPs-elect in attendance 
at the Convention, six are former NLD members who were 
dismissed from the party in the 1990s.  End note.)  One 
elderly delegate, from the pro-regime Union Karen League, is 
unable to walk or to speak and was reportedly hospitalized 
upon arrival at an on-site medical facility. 
 
5. (SBU) An unknown number of delegates at the Convention, 
though likely the majority according to Embassy sources, are 
civil servants and members of the SPDC\'s mass-member 
organization, the Union Solidarity and Development 
Association (USDA).  In fact, many local Burmese deride the 
Convention as nothing more than a mass rally of the USDA and, 
in a play on words in the Burmese language, refer to the 
event as the \"Cheat the Nation Convention.\" 
 
6. (U) State-controlled media have devoted considerable print 
and air time to \"coverage\" of the National Convention which, 
for the first week, has consisted mostly of a series of 
instructions and warnings for delegates regarding their role 
in the proceedings.  In the opening days, Minister for 
Information Brigadier General Kyaw Hsan, in his capacity as 
Secretary of the Convention\'s Convening Commission, spelled 
 
SIPDIS 
out a series of \"procedures\" for delegates, including 
(exactly as published): 
 
--Whenever entering or going out of the meeting hall, all are 
to bow to the State flag; 
 
--Do not talk about the interests of organizations and 
persons that are not in the framework of law; 
 
--A delegate is to discuss the topics in line with the 
proposal paper sent (and approved) in advance and not to 
discuss the topics that are not included in the paper; 
 
--When the plenary meeting or the meeting of the delegate 
groups are in progress, the delegates are not allowed to walk 
out individually or in groups; 
--Delegates are advised to put on suitable clothes, to avoid 
having bath at an unreasonable time and eat junk food. 
 
--These regulations are prescribed not for repression but for 
the interest of the national races and the delegates. 
 
7. (U) Lt General Thein Sein, the junta\'s fifth-ranking 
member and chairman of the Convening Commission, addressed 
the delegates with a sober message that the 1993-1996 
National Convention had \"already formulated\" the basis for a 
State Constitution and informed the delegates that their 
present, and unique, duty was to ensure \"the emergence of a 
discipline-flourishing democracy.\" 
 
8. (C) Thein Sein\'s message struck a discordant note with the 
main cease-fire groups in attendance at the Convention, many 
of whom view the drafting of a new constitution as their only 
opportunity to codify the autonomy they enjoy on most 
administrative, security, and economic matters.  In addition 
to the grievances expressed by a loose coalition of eight 
major cease-fire groups, expressed via letter to Prime 
Minister Khin Nyunt on May 12 (ref B), two leading Kachin 
cease-fire groups (the KIO and the NKA-K) also wrote to the 
PM on May 16 urging the SPDC to make accommodations allowing 
the NLD to participate, observing that a failed Convention 
would be an \"ugly blemish on Burma\'s history.\" 
 
9. (C) Comment:  There is no question that the SPDC has 
reconvened the National Convention to rubber stamp a 
pre-drafted constitution as the first step toward a 
\"disciplined democracy.\"  To the regime, the NLD and the UNA 
boycott (ref A) is apparently a mere irritant to this 
showcase event, given the generals\' ability to assemble, in 
some cases with the help of threats and intimidation, a cast 
of delegates that will bless the entire process.  Although 
the cease-fire groups could create some drama through further 
public airing of their grievances, or even an eventual 
walk-out, such actions are unlikely to deter the SPDC, which 
has no intention of letting this version of the National 
Convention spin out of its control.  End Comment.

1.  (C) A special two-judge panel of the Burmese Supreme 
Court on May 12 supported a secret lower court\'s ruling from 
November 2003 that two men, Naing Min Kyi and Aye Mint, are 
guilty of treason for contacting the International Labor 
Organization (ref).  However, on the basis of a lack of 
evidence the panel changed the specific treason charges 
against them to \"aiding and abetting people committing 
treason\" and reduced their sentences from death to three 
years in prison. 
 
2.  (C) The special panel also upheld the ruling by the lower 
court for a third defendant, Shwe Man, who was found guilty 
of treason partly for contacting the ILO and partly for 
allegedly plotting to assassinate SPDC leaders.  The panel 
reduced Shwe Man\'s sentence from death to life in prison. 
 
3.  COMMENT: The special panel\'s ruling, which we believe was 
ordered by the highest levels of the regime, at first glance 
appears a positive development since it overturns several 
death sentences.  However, three years in jail simply for 
contacting the ILO is still unacceptable and runs counter to 
the regime\'s previously stated willingness to create a 
permissive environment for the ILO to operate in Burma.  END

1. (SBU) Summary: In the COM\'s first meeting with Burma\'s 
Forestry Minister we were able to finally get the GOB\'s 
official line on wildlife trafficking and illegal timbering, 
and clarify an outstanding rumor regarding the punishment of 
a Ministry official for illegal contact with the Embassy. 
Though the Minister did not seem particularly engaged, 
conservation NGOs tell us he is pretty good on the important 
issues.  Perhaps Burma\'s protected, but neglected, regions 
will benefit.  End summary. 
 
From the Woodwork 
 
2. (SBU) After waiting nearly four months for a response to 
our meeting request, the Minister of Forestry agreed with 
less than a day\'s notice to meet the Chief of Mission (COM) 
on May 21st.  There was no explanation for the delay or why 
the Minister was willing to meet now, in the midst of the 
reconvening of the National Constitutional Convention. 
 
3. (SBU) Minister Brigadier General Thein Aung took office in 
August 2003.  He is a major political player, holding a 
position on the Central Executive Committee of the SPDC\'s 
mass-action group, the Union Solidarity and Development 
Association.  Before his promotion he was a Deputy Energy 
Minister.  Minister Brig Gen Thein Aung took over a month 
after the forced retirement of his predecessor U Aung Phone 
-- reportedly sacked for particularly egregious corruption. 
U Aung Phone has also been tied in the international press to 
the scandal surrounding the Iraqi Oil-for-Food program -- 
though undoubtedly this had no impact on his removal. 
 
A Man of Few Words 
 
4. (SBU) During the meeting, the COM covered the scope of 
environmental issues here.  She noted the Forestry Ministry\'s 
cooperation in recent months with the Smithsonian and 
California Academy of Sciences for an annual wild elephant 
survey, with a consortium led by Total and UNOCAL to set 
aside for protection a large swath of land around their 
natural gas pipeline in southeastern Burma, and with U.S. 
conservation NGO Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).  WCS is 
the implementing partner in a newly announced 4,800 square 
mile tiger preserve in northwest Burma.  The COM also queried 
the Minister about Burma\'s problems with illegal and 
unsustainable logging and with trafficking of wildlife over 
the Chinese border. 
 
5. (SBU) The Minister was quite reticent and did not seem 
overly pleased to see us.  He accepted the COM\'s comments 
with a nod and answered her questions with pat explanations 
of \"improved cooperation\" within the ministries and with Thai 
and Chinese government officials to cut down on the export of 
illegal timber and endangered species.  He pointed to the 
capture by the army of \"100 logging trucks\" near the Chinese 
border as evidence of the GOB\'s serious efforts. 
Nonetheless, reftels and other reports published in recent 
months by conservation NGOs and scientists in China\'s Yunnan 
Province point out the continued magnitude of both timber and 
wildlife trafficking from Burma to China and Thailand. 
 
6. (SBU) The Minister did explain that Prime Minister Khin 
Nyunt (known for his relatively pro-conservation tendencies) 
had established a new committee on environmental conservation 
under the chairmanship of Foreign Minister U Win Aung.  The 
committee is now working on reforestation projects in Pegu 
Yoma (a heavily timbered region north of Rangoon) and on 
income generation and education programs among populations 
resident in or alongside protected areas.  Both of these 
campaigns, the Minister said pointedly, were sorely in need 
of international or INGO financial and technical assistance. 
 
Forestry Official Faces the Music 
 
7. (C) The Minister became slightly more animated when the 
COM asked for clarification of a February report from the 
Democratic Voice of Burma that a Forestry Ministry official 
had been sentenced to death for transmitting sensitive 
documents to the U.S. Embassy.  The Minister verified that 
indeed an official, U Sann Min, had been arrested after the 
post office intercepted unspecified documents he was mailing 
to the Embassy.  He said, however, that he had no knowledge 
of U Sann Min\'s sentence.  The COM stressed that the Embassy 
had no knowledge of this incident and certainly had not been 
soliciting classified materials from any Forestry Ministry 
officials.  The Minister took this on board without comment. 
 
National Convention? What National Convention? 
 
8. (C) Seeking a top political operator\'s view of the newly 
reconvened National Convention, the COM asked about the 
Convention\'s recent discussions on the future of the 
country\'s conservation, forestry, and ecotourism policies. 
The transcript of these deliberations had taken up dozens of 
column-inches in the May 20th New Light of Myanmar newspaper. 
 The Minister seemed completely puzzled by this question and 
moved on to something else. 
 
Comment: Prospects are Positive 
 
9. (C) Despite a perfunctory performance in the meeting, the 
Minister\'s attitude toward conservation has received 
relatively high marks by conservation NGOs in Rangoon. 
Perhaps this is just in comparison to his notoriously corrupt 
predecessor, who focused all his attention on the income 
generating side of the Ministry (timbering) at the expense of 
conservation projects.  Though these projects, and Burma\'s 
protected areas, continue to suffer from a lack of human and 
financial resources, perhaps with a more conservation-focused 
Minister and Prime Minister in place, and with new sources of 
private funding coming online (for instance from Total and 
WCS), the future for Burma\'s protected areas may be a bit 
brighter.  End comment.

Classified By: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ; REASON 1.4(D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The United States wants to dominate Burma 
in order to penetrate China\'s soft underbelly, according to 
Burmese Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt.  The PM, speaking 
with a visiting ethnic leader, laid out his strategic views 
of the United States and China.  Burma must resist U.S. 
pressure, Khin Nyunt went on, as China would never stand for 
it and Burma could be destroyed.  While this view may strike 
some observers as ludicrous, Chinese and U.S. Cold War 
policies in the region -- specifically, alleged USG support 
for KMT remnants operating from Burma and Chinese aid to the 
ethnic guerrillas of the Communist Party of Burma -- continue 
to influence Burmese military views of U.S. intentions and 
potential Chinese reactions.  Khin Nyunt\'s tight relationship 
with the Wa and Kokang narco-warlords along the Sino-Burmese 
border, most of whom were members of the Communist Party of 
Burma (CPB), in part may reflect the GOB\'s concerns that a 
perceived Chinese and U.S. rivalry could embroil Burma.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Post has recently viewed a video of the December 2003 
meeting between Khin Nyunt and Karen National Union leader Bo 
Mya.  Post linguists deem an exile-produced translation of 
the dialogue to be generally accurate.  General Khin Nyunt is 
usually very formal and highly protocol conscious.  However, 
in this bizarre discussion Khin Nyunt and Bo Mya get quite 
personal, revealing that they both dye their hair while 
debating whether they should call each other \"uncle/nephew\" 
or \"older brother/younger brother.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) After nearly a half hour of familial banter, 
General Khin Nyunt provides the following strategic overview 
of U.S. intentions toward Burma and China: 
 
Begin Translation: 
 
\"America on the other side is exerting pressure.  That is 
because they want Myanmar to be their follower.  Only when 
Myanmar becomes their follower will they be able to penetrate 
China from the side (\"using the side door\").  Myanmar is a 
very important country or a strategic nation for America, Pha 
Tee (\"uncle\").  That is why America wants Myanmar to be their 
follower or keep it under its influence.\" 
 
\"If Myanmar accepts that status, America will be able to use 
Myanmar as a staging ground to penetrate China.  That is the 
reason why America is exerting a lot of pressure on our 
nation.  Hence, we do not have the slightest bit of trust in 
America.  We will not be their follower, Pha Tee.  If we do 
that, our country will be destroyed.  Why would China stand 
for it?  Am I right?  If America were to penetrate China from 
our borders, China will not accept it, and our country will 
be in trouble.\" 
 
\"Hence, in order to prevent our country from getting into 
trouble and make it stable, we have to associate with the 
Kala (derogatory term for Indian) and the Chinese.  But we 
cannot associate with America because it is exerting immense 
pressure on us.  We have to make friends with ASEAN countries 
and with neighboring countries.\" 
 
End Translation. 
 
4.  (SBU) A number of senior Burmese leaders have made their 
politico-military careers fighting the mutant legacies of 
USG-supported KMT units that retreated into northern Burma 
after the Chinese civil war a half-century ago.  In January 
Emboffs participating in a GOB tour of Shan State (reftel) 
noted that the five GOB cabinet ministers, all senior 
military officers, grew excited as the aircraft prepared to 
land at an isolated outpost.  One of the senior military 
officers turned to an embassy officer and explained, \"This 
next stop is where the Commerce Minister led a successful 
attack against one of Khun Sa\'s last strongholds in 1995.\" 
(Note: The Mong Tai Army, led by drug lord Khun Sa, evolved 
from ethnic insurgents with previous links to the KMT 
remnants in Burma.  End Note) 
 
5.  (C) Part of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt\'s political (and 
financial?) clout comes from his close relationship with the 
Kokang and Wa cease-fire groups located along the 
Sino-Burmese border.  With 25,000 troops under arms, these 
groups control much of the legitimate and smuggled border 
trade with China.  Until its implosion in 1989, the CPB\'s 
formidable Peoples Army was manned by many Wa and Kokang 
troops and supported by the Communist Party of China.  Khin 
Nyunt\'s success of binding the border-straddling Wa and 
Kokang groups firmly to Burma has been one of his major 
accomplishments.  The United Wa State Army (UWSA) is 
currently led by a former member of the CPB Central Committee 
and is headquartered in the same town as was the CPB.  That 
the UWSA is the biggest narcotics outfit this side of 
Afghanistan means Khin Nyunt mingles with some pretty shady 
characters on a regular basis.  In August 2003 when Khin 
Nyunt lost the Secretary 1 title, UWSA troops went on full 
alert for two days, fearful that their main patron in Rangoon 
was being ousted. 
 
6.  (SBU) The National League for Democracy\'s leadership has 
also been affected by this dynamic.  The NLD\'s deputy 
chairman, U Tin Oo, earned his military reputation as a 
field-grade officer fighting KMT units; his rise to Minister 
of Defense meant that when he joined the NLD he was seen as a 
man of clout and influence.  He met his wife, an army doctor, 
after being wounded in combat against a KMT unit decades ago, 
he told us last year. 
7.  (U) SPDC spokesman Colonel Hla Min, in the April 2004 
edition of his work \"Political Situation of the Union of 
Myanmar and Its Role in the Region,\" articulates the SPDC 
line that the United States seeks to dominate Burma in the 
context of U.S. strategy vis--vis China.  He writes: 
 
\"Therefore, from the western point of view, Myanmar could be 
deemed to be the weak link in the regional China containment 
policy as primarily advocated by the United States.  Their 
attempt to turn Myanmar into a satellite state of the West by 
their blatant interference in Myanmar\'s internal affairs 
under the much abused and misused pretext of human rights and 
democracy is quite obvious.\" 
 
8.  (C) Comment and Conclusion:  The regime\'s seemingly 
reflexive anti-Americanism may in part be based on this 
time-warped strategic view of U.S. intentions toward China 
and the fear that Burma would be caught in between.  This 
strategic misperception is reinforced by the current, 
entirely deserved criticism the USG regularly levels at the 
junta.  It is perhaps understandable that during the height 
of the Cold War era the Burmese military may have viewed the 
KMT units in Burma as America\'s surrogates and saw the CPB\'s 
Wa and Kokang guerrillas as China\'s proxies.  Paradoxically, 
if the Burmese regime\'s embrace of China is meant to help it 
maintain its sovereignty in the face of perceived American 
efforts to make Burma a U.S. satellite, this poses a 
substantial risk to Burma\'s future -- Chinese trade, 
investment, cultural, and political inroads, especially in 
northern and northeastern Burma, are becoming increasingly 
dominant.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  Burma\'s ruling SPDC views China as its key 
bilateral partner and seeks to use the relationship as 
evidence of its legitimacy and to offset pressure by the 
international community, particularly the United States, for 
concrete movement toward national reconciliation and 
democracy.  The Burmese regime\'s engagement with China has 
resulted in significant political gains in this regard.  The 
PRC has been particularly effective in accessing Burma\'s 
government elites.  China\'s ability to influence regime 
leadership, however, seems to be more limited.  The PRC is 
the dominant economic force in Burma and is a regular 
provider of tied aid via grants and low interest loans. 
Large-scale and freewheeling border trade lends a lifeline to 
Burmese consumers and businesspeople suffering from GOB trade 
policies.  It also provides an important outlet and source of 
foreign exchange to the Burmese government, blocked by U.S. 
sanctions from using the international banking system for 
U.S. dollar-based international commerce. 
 
2. (C) It is the Burmese military, particularly those 
officers with direct experience confronting the PRC-supported 
Burmese Communist insurgency, which remains the most wary of 
China\'s motives.  Nonetheless, senior-level contacts between 
the two governments and Chinese economic largesse will 
continue.  However, the GOB will seek to balance China\'s 
increased influence by expanding its bilateral cooperation 
with India in an effort to maximize its \"bennies\" from both 
neighbors.  End Summary. 
 
Political: 
 
3. (C) Burma, specifically the ruling State Peace and 
Development Council (SPDC), views China as its key bilateral 
partner.  In addition to regarding China as a reliable 
provider of grants, training, and low interest loans, the 
regime seeks to use the deepening, supportive relationship as 
evidence of its legitimacy and to offset political pressure 
by the international community, particularly the United 
States and the European Union (EU), for concrete movement 
toward national reconciliation and democracy.  While we 
assess that the Burmese military harbors a lingering wariness 
about Chinese motives and influence, we can note no criticism 
of China by regime officials, either in private or in the 
press.  Although the GOB remains reluctant to provide 
concessions on issues of past import to China, such as 
development of the Irrawaddy River transport route to the sea 
(ref L), our interlocutors on both sides focus on the 
positive mutual benefits of the current relationship.  In 
addition, we have no evidence that the regime considers China 
either a regional \"hegemon\" or a potential neighborhood 
bully. 
 
4. (C) Economic assistance aside, the most obvious indication 
of the emphasis the Burmese regime places on the relationship 
is the well-publicized access Chinese central government and 
provincial officials, especially those from Yunnan province, 
routinely have to Burma\'s three top leaders, SPDC Chairman 
Senior General Than Shwe, SPDC Vice Chairman Vice Senior 
General Maung Aye, and Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt. 
Beginning with Chinese President Jiang Zemin\'s trip to Burma 
in December 2001 and culminating most recently with the March 
visit of Vice Premier Wu Yi (ref D), there has been a steady 
stream of high-level visits back and forth, most of which 
have an economic/business focus.  Besides Wu Yi\'s trip, 
highlights in 2004 include a visit by the Deputy Minister of 
the PRC Ministry of Economy and Commerce in January and the 
Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People\'s Consultative Conference 
(CPPCC) in late February (he met with Than Shwe).  Vice 
Senior General Maung Aye went to China in August 2003.  These 
visits, as well as those by local Yunnanese economic 
officials and representatives of Chinese state-owned 
enterprises, and businessmen, garner extensive coverage in 
Burma\'s government-controlled newspaper as well as GOB press 
releases/information sheets.  Even the Chinese Ambassador\'s 
April 21 call on Khin Nyunt, who ws identified on the 
occasion as General rather than Prime Minister, merited a 
front-page article in the government-controlled newspaper. 
(Note:  PM Khin Nyunt is the Chairman of the Leading 
Committee for implementation of agreements on economic 
cooperation between Burma and China. End Note.) 
 
5. (C) As a result of its policy of engagement with China, 
the Burmese regime has achieved public political gains on an 
issue of primary concern to the Burmese regime -- 
international legitimacy.  China has not publicly criticized 
Burma and has given the regime key public support on issues 
such as U.S. sanctions and Burma\'s human rights situation. 
In this regard, we note public statements by Chinese State 
Councilor Tang Jiaxuan in August 2003, immediately after the 
United States imposed more stringent sanctions, in which he 
said he opposed any moves to isolate the Burmese regime. 
Another more recent public relations success for Burma was a 
comment by the Chinese ambassador to Geneva during debate on 
a U.N. Commission on Human Rights resolution critical of 
Burma\'s human rights record, in which he said Beijing 
regretted that the resolution did not fully and accurately 
reflect the human rights situation in Burma.  Locally, we 
point to consistent efforts by the Chinese ambassador to urge 
the United States and other like-minded nations to reduce 
pressure on the regime and, in the specific case of the 
United States, to withdraw sanctions.  This despite 
assurances from the Ambassador to us in several meetings that 
transition to democracy is inevitable, necessary, and must 
include the primary opposition group, the National League for 
Democracy (NLD).  However, we assess that the overall 
Sino-Burmese relationship has not been tested to any degree 
in recent years.  In addition, this public posture of lauding 
relations between the two countries belies at least some 
wariness on the part of military and economic elites who 
remember the Chinese-sponsored Burmese Communist insurgency 
and fear a potential impact on local businesses (see para 8), 
respectively. 
 
6. (C) Though the PRC has been particularly effective in 
accessing government elites, its ability to influence regime 
leadership seems to be more limited.  Nonetheless, the 
continued outpouring of soft loans and debt forgiveness and 
willingness to participate in Burmese-hosted and reciprocal 
high-level visits, such as the delegation to China led by 
Maung Aye, suggest China takes the relationship equally 
seriously, albeit for different reasons.  Looking at China\'s 
motivations from a local perspective, China\'s key objectives 
are tied to its concern with potential political and economic 
instability in a bordering country; a belief that economic 
development is key to and a necessary prerequisite for 
political development; an interest in reducing the spread of 
drugs from Burma to China\'s Yunnan province and beyond; and 
growing demand for consistent, and nearby, sources of natural 
resources.  While our Chinese interlocutors are always 
\"on-message\" in their acknowledgment of progress in all areas 
of cooperation, we judge that Sino-Burmese counternarcotics 
efforts have had limited success; that Chinese efforts to 
secure access to needed natural resources, such as timber, 
are becoming more successful (though often through informal 
means); and that there is growing frustration with the 
Burmese regime\'s perceived inability to develop and follow 
sound economic policies.  On the question of stability, we 
view the Chinese as being pragmatic -- for as long as the 
current regime maintains power, the PRC will focus its 
efforts on deepening relationships with current political and 
economic elites.  Should Burma\'s domestic political situation 
change, the PRC will respond by building relationships with 
the new elites.  We do not expect the Chinese Embassy to 
develop ties with political opposition leaders at this time, 
as they consider doing so would compromise current 
influence/access for no apparent gain.  In fact, the Chinese 
ambassador has made this point explicitly in all our meetings 
with him. 
 
Economics: 
 
7. (C) The PRC is the dominant economic force in Burma. 
Large-scale and freewheeling border trade lends a lifeline to 
Burmese consumers and businesspeople suffering under bizarre 
GOB trade policies.  It also provides an important outlet and 
source of foreign exchange to the Burmese government blocked 
by U.S. sanctions from using the banking system for U.S. 
dollar-based international commerce.  China\'s small investors 
and traders are omnipresent in Burma\'s large cities and in 
the mines and forests of Kachin and Shan States.  Finally, 
the PRC government provides an almost endless stream of soft 
loans and grants for Burma\'s \"economic development\" and to 
promote exports of Chinese (usually Yunnanese and Sichuan) 
products and services.  Chinese companies are the primary 
foreign participants in most, if not all, of Burma\'s largest 
public works projects: roads, bridges, and power plants. 
Burma\'s ethnic Chinese, sometimes with far closer ties to 
China than Rangoon, are among the most powerful \"domestic\" 
businesspeople in Burma. 
 
8. (C) Though there is a long history of a Chinese merchant 
class in Burma, economic ties between the two countries were 
sour until the mid-1990s due to the PRC\'s support until 1989 
of the Burmese Communist Party, a once powerful insurgent 
group.  In a capital-starved nation, consumers and some 
businesses welcome the current influx of Chinese money (both 
from the PRC and from ethnic Chinese) and products.  However, 
many cash-poor ethnic Burman, Kachin, and other 
businesspeople criticize the \"invasion\" for crowding them 
out.  The Burmese garment sector also fears that it will not 
be able to compete with China in exporting to Europe and 
other nations once textile quotas are removed in 2005. 
However, the poor state of the industry - due to the GOB\'s 
economic policies and a U.S. import ban - is eroding its 
competitiveness even before the deadline. 
 
9. (C) Alongside continued PRC tied aid comes forgiveness or 
rescheduling of unpaid debt.  During a January 2003 visit to 
China by Than Shwe the PRC agreed to forgive $80 million (ref 
L), and in a March 2004 visit to Burma by Vice Premier Wu Yi, 
the PRC rescheduled $120 million in overdue debt from $560 
million worth of tied aid (ref E).  Though the PRC seems 
willing now to be flexible on debt repayment, we are 
concerned with potential future consequences of Burma\'s 
massive build-up of Chinese debt.  Depending on how the 
political winds blow, this debt service will either cement a 
colonial bond or become a huge burden for a democratic regime 
that may favor the West. 
 
10. (C) For China, it appears the closer economic ties and 
millions of dollars of state money invested (with little 
likely to be repaid) are aimed at propping up regional 
exporters and developing preferential access to Burma\'s vast 
natural resources.  The Chinese ambassador here recently told 
us his government was keen to \"reduce China\'s trade surplus\" 
with Burma (ref D).  An agreement signed during the Wu Yi 
visit more explicitly spelled out China\'s interest in getting 
preference for investments in Burma\'s natural gas and oil, 
and in named copper and nickel deposits (ref C).  Discussions 
with MOFA\'s China hand also revealed a PRC interest in 
getting unfettered access to the sea via Burma\'s Irrawaddy 
River. 
11. (C) According to official Chinese media sources, 
bilateral trade in 2003 was $1 billion, up from about $860 
million in 2002.  During the Wu Yi visit, the two sides inked 
a bilateral agreement that, among other things, pledged to 
expand trade volume to $1.5 billion by 2005 (ref C). 
According to Xinhua-cited data, $900 million of the current 
trade volume is Chinese exports while $170 million is Burmese 
exports.  Media-cited PRC data asserts that $490 million of 
the trade volume is between Yunnan and Burma (border trade). 
None of these figures presumably include the significant 
smuggling in both directions.  To China go timber, gems 
(mostly jade from Kachin State), and drugs (opium, heroin, 
and methamphetamines).  To Burma come all variety of consumer 
goods, which GOB import restrictions categorically forbid. 
The majority of legal exports from Burma are agricultural 
products, while the largest Chinese exports are machinery, 
raw materials for Burma\'s piecework textile factories, and 
metals. 
 
12. (C) Border regions, especially in Shan State where roads 
are better than in Kachin State, look to China more than 
Rangoon for investment and economic growth.  Often 
transportation links are better between peripheral cities and 
the Chinese and Thai borders than between the cities and 
Rangoon.  Opium poppy substitution projects in northern Shan 
State hinge on developing reliable export markets in China 
for the new rubber, fruit, and grain being grown.  To this 
end the PRC promise to reduce tariffs for the poorest ASEAN 
members is a boon.  The RMB is freely used in Burmese border 
towns for trade transactions and is also the currency of 
choice for local consumers and shopkeepers in these areas 
(ref F and I).  Chinese (Mandarin) is also the language of 
choice in local schools and for the growing local commercial 
class. 
 
13. (C) Chinese investment: according to notoriously 
unreliable GOB statistics, as of the end of FY 2002-03 
(April-March) the PRC ranked only 15th in the level of 
\"approved\" FDI with 13 projects worth $64.15 million.  Hong 
Kong was 10th with 29 approved projects worth $162.72 
million.  (Note: The GOB only counts historically approved 
FDI, not actual or remaining foreign investment.)  This 
official number is clearly absurd.  Xinhua cites Yunnanese 
officials who claim investment in Burma for their province 
alone is between $200 million and $400 million.  GOB 
statistics seem not to take into account the innumerable 
small investments by Chinese merchants in Rangoon, Mandalay, 
and north and east of Mandalay to the Chinese border.  The 
numbers also don\'t account for illegal Chinese investments in 
gold and jade mining projects in the rivers and hills of 
Kachin State.  These latter investments in particular are 
made by PRC Chinese through a local cut out, by PRC Chinese 
who buy phony Burmese ID papers, or by ethnic Chinese Burmese 
citizens -- many of whom have amassed significant capital in 
the drug trade (ref M). 
 
Military: 
 
14. (C)  It is the military, particularly those officers with 
direct experience confronting the PRC-supported Burmese 
Communist insurgency, that remains the most wary of China\'s 
motivations.  Nonetheless, this wariness has not impeded the 
strengthening of this aspect of the Sino-Burmese relationship 
nor led to efforts to decrease reliance on Chinese-supplied 
armaments.  The Chinese military attach (milatt) appears to 
have the same kind of access on the military side that the 
Ambassador has on the political side; the newly arrived 
milatt, who has had multiple tours in Burma, was received by 
Vice-Senior General Maung Aye in late April, soon after his 
arrival. (See ref O, \"Burmese Military Intelligence Officer 
Comments on PLA Efforts to Expand Military Influence in 
Burma.\") 
 
Comment: 
 
15. (C) We anticipate continued senior level contacts between 
the two governments and continued Chinese economic largesse, 
albeit tied to specific companies and heavily oriented toward 
Yunnan Province, as China further consolidates its position 
as Burma\'s key partner.  For its part, we expect the GOB will 
continue to pander to China, at least on the surface, 
allowing consistent access to the \"top three,\" accepting tied 
aid, and continuing the ongoing positive public relations 
campaign in the local press.  However, the GOB also will seek 
to balance China\'s increased influence by expanding its 
bilateral cooperation with India in an effort to maximize its 
\"bennies\" from both neighbors.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: ILO\'s man in Rangoon briefed diplomats on 
ambiguous news from Burma\'s Supreme Court, increased forced 
labor reports, and the GOB\'s inadequate responses.  All of 
these issues will be discussed in Geneva on June 5th in the 
context of the ILO\'s postponed timetable for a Plan of Action 
for Burma.  At this point we think it premature to support 
resuming the Plan.  End summary. 
 
Guilty, But Not as Charged 
 
2.  (C) The ILO\'s Liaison Officer Richard Horsey briefed the 
Rangoon diplomatic community, including the COM, on May 25th 
on a wide array of labor and human rights issues.  On the 
matter of the three individuals sentenced for, among other 
things, having in their possession public ILO documents and a 
ILO business card (reftel), Mr. Horsey indicated that the ILO 
was not at all pleased by the special two-judge Supreme Court 
panel\'s recent decision to uphold the conviction but reduce 
the sentences.  He said that the decision, of which he\'d only 
seen an informal version, did not specifically reject the 
lower court\'s identification of the possession of ILO 
materials as treasonous.  He also said there was concern 
because the Panel\'s decision identified the Thailand-based 
Free Trade Unions of Burma (FTUB) as a treasonous 
organization and thus, by extension, all those who contacted 
the FTUB could be guilty of treason or conspiracy.  Horsey 
noted that the head of the FTUB, U Maung Maung (son of NLD 
Central Executive Committee member Nyunt Wei), had previously 
been found guilty of treason in absentia and that the court 
was citing contact of any kind with U Maung Maung as 
treasonous. 
 
3. (C) Mr. Horsey said that he and the ILO 
facilitator-designate in Burma, Mr. Leon de Reidmatten, had 
re-visited on May 25th the three convicts in Insein Prison. 
The prisoners reported that they had not been given access to 
their lawyers to request an appeal. (Note: under Burmese law 
they can appeal their case to the full Supreme Court and then 
to the head of state.)  Horsey said the ILO planned to 
contact the attorneys forthwith to pass on this request. 
 
Complaints Up, Responses Down 
 
4. (C) Turning to broader ILO operations in Burma, Mr. Horsey 
said that ILO officials could travel freely and had regular 
and cordial meetings with the Labor Minister U Tin Win.  He 
said that he was encouraged by the increasing number of 
incident reports that individuals were filing with the ILO 
office in Rangoon.  These allegations were coming in mostly 
from the Rangoon area, but also from other corners of the 
country, and were being made by activists but also by 
villagers.  The ILO had received about 40 reports since 
January 2004, with 30 coming since March (following the 
initial news of death penalty sentences for the ILO 
contacts).  Mr. Horsey said that after initial review he had 
passed 22 of these cases onto the GOB for action. 
Encouragingly, Horsey reported, the GOB had taken rapid and 
effective action on the first few cases -- in two cases 
returning child soldiers to their families and in another 
case firing a local official overseeing forced labor. 
However, even while the GOB was taking appropriate action, in 
its official replies to the ILO the GOB has thus far denied 
finding any evidence to back up the complaints. 
 
5. (C) After its initial burst of activity, the GOB has been 
less responsive on more recent cases.  Horsey said he had 
heard no response on any of the last 15 allegations forwarded 
for action.  Horsey hypothesized that this could be an honest 
oversight, due to a sore lack of investigative capacity. 
However, he admitted he had no way to know for sure. 
 
Whither the Plan of Action? 
 
6. (C) Mr. Horsey canvassed the assembled diplomats (from the 
UK, Italy, France, Germany, Australia, Japan, South Korea, 
and the United States) regarding the ILO Applications 
Committee\'s discussion in Geneva on June 5th of Burma and its 
postponed Plan of Action.  None actively supported a quick 
reinstatement of the Plan\'s timetable.  The Chief of Mission 
stressed that there were few signs of positive action by the 
GOB since the last deliberation in March and the recent 
decline in the quantity and quality of the GOB response to 
complaints was cause for caution, as the GOB would read 
implementation of the plan of action now as blessing their 
response (or lack thereof). Mr. Horsey agreed, but said the 
ILO would be encouraged if, by June 5th, the GOB publicly 
announced that the Supreme Court had agreed to hear the 
appeals of the three convicted for their ILO ties. 
Ultimately, he said, the ILO would not be satisfied unless 
the GOB released the two individuals now convicted of 
conspiracy and reduced further the sentence of the individual 
convicted of treason to one of possession of an illegal 
satellite phone. 
 
Comment: No Goodwill, No Support 
 
7. (C) Given the ILO rep\'s less than upbeat briefing, it 
seems premature to discuss a return to the proposed timetable 
for implementing the Plan of Action.  Though it\'s good news 
that people feel more comfortable to approach the ILO with 
complaints, the GOB still appears to lack commitment to 
addressing this issue.  Resolving complaints quietly is not 
the same as publicly admitting a case of forced labor and 
prosecuting the offender.  Also, as the ILO here rightly 
points out, the cases of the ILO contacts are far from 
satisfactorily resolved.  Though the courts, and thus the 
SPDC, have moved off their untenable death sentence position, 
they are still poised to criminalize contact with the primary 
representative of Burma\'s disbanded labor unions and leave 
unresolved the legal status of contact with the ILO.  End 
comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The NLD on May 27 marked 14 years since the 
party\'s stunning victory in the 1990 general elections.  At a 
somber event at party headquarters, attended by several 
hundred members and supporters, the NLD demanded that the 
results of the 1990 elections be implemented without delay. 
Despite the party\'s remarkable patience and persistence, 
however, the resolve of the military regime to retain full 
power remains undaunted.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The National League for Democracy (NLD) held a somber 
commemorative event on May 27 at party headquarters in 
Rangoon to mark the 14th anniversary of the 1990 general 
elections, won overwhelmingly by the NLD, but the results of 
which have never been recognized by the military regime. 
Several hundred party members and supporters attended the 
function, as did a dozen diplomats including COM, British 
Ambassador, UNDP resident representative, and officers from 
the Embassies of Japan, Germany, France, Italy, and 
Australia.  Absent, of course, were NLD Vice Chairman U Tin 
Oo and General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi who remain under 
house arrest. 
 
3. (U) NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe delivered a statement in 
which the NLD demanded that the results of the 1990 elections 
be implemented without delay, declaring that \"the country\'s 
political, economic, and social crises can only be solved by 
calling the Pyithu Hluttaw (Parliament) composed of members 
elected and mandated by the people.\" 
 
4. (U) U Aung Shwe and other NLD speakers avoided direct 
reference to the SPDC\'s ongoing constitutional Convention, 
which the vast majority of Members-elect of Parliament, 
including NLD and other pro-democracy party members, are 
boycotting.  However, the NLD Chairman made several pointed 
swipes at the regime\'s road map process, quoting sundry SPDC 
leaders, including Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt, who 
have over the years made unambiguous promises to allow an 
elected body of delegates draw up a new constitution. 
 
5. (SBU) Several leaders of ethnic parties affiliated with 
the NLD delivered statements of support, calling for the 
release of ASSK and U Tin Oo and a political dialogue (the 
Kaman NLD even boldly declared the National Convention 
\"illegitimate.\")  However, noticeably absent from the 
function was Hkun Htun Oo, leader of Burma\'s leading ethnic 
opposition party, the SNLD.  Hkun Htun Oo is also chairman of 
the multi-ethnic, pro-democracy political coalition, the 
United Nationalities Alliance (UNA).  The regime has in 
recent days made veiled threats toward the UNA, emphasizing 
that the coalition is not registered (and is therefore 
illegal) and that most of its member parties are barred from 
political activities. 
 
6. (C) As a backdrop to the NLD\'s commemorative event, the 
military regime continues to flood state-run media with 
coverage of the National Convention, extolling the \"progress\" 
achieved by its hand-picked delegates in drafting a new 
constitution.  According to sources who have had clandestine 
contact with sequestered delegates, regime authorities have 
blocked almost all participants from leaving the remote 
Convention site.  Over the weekend of May 22-23, during a 
lull in scheduled events, numerous delegates unsuccessfully 
sought permission to leave in order to attend to personal and 
business matters.  However, the expansive USDA training 
center is heavily guarded and the authorities have 
essentially responded \"With karaoke rooms, a golf course, a 
beauty shop, and a hospital, you have all you need right here 
on the premises.\" 
 
7. (C) Comment:  For some in the NLD it seems impossible that 
14 years have passed since their stunning victory at the 
polls in 1990.  The cruel reality that the SPDC has blocked 
party members from assuming their rightful role as leaders of 
a freely elected Parliament has not, however, undercut the 
party\'s drive to press for democracy and national 
reconciliation.  Patience and persistence, however, have done 
little to chip away at the resolve of the military regime to 
retain full power.  End Comment.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
 
Burma remains the world\'s second largest producer of illicit 
opium, although in 2003 the world\'s top producer, 
Afghanistan, produced 83 percent more opium than Burma. 
However, Burma\'s role in the regional production and traffic 
of amphetamine-type substances (ATS) is growing. 
 
In our view, over the past year the GOB has made substantial 
gains in reducing poppy cultivation and opium production; 
expanding cooperation with other countries in the region; and 
establishing drug-related laws and regulations.  The GOB has 
made minimal progress with a law-enforcement campaign 
targeting the most prominent trafficking groups and their 
leaders, although ongoing cooperation with the DEA and others 
may yield more positive results.  The GOB recognizes the 
serious problems that ATS pose to the country and to the 
region, but has made minimal progress in stemming the growth 
of ATS production and trafficking.  The GOB has, overall, 
made insignificant progress in combating corruption; 
fostering counternarcotics cooperation between itself and the 
ethnic groups involved in drug production and trafficking, 
especially the Wa; and enforcing its narcotics and 
money-laundering legislation. 
 
(1) PERFORMANCE IN AREAS IDENTIFIED IN THE 1988 UN DRUG 
CONVENTION 
 
A. Cultivation/manufacturing 
---------------------------- 
 
Specific Goal: In 2003, the USG and others in the 
international community urged the GOB to establish a 
mechanism for the reliable measurement of methamphetamine 
production and demonstrate progress in reducing production 
and increasing seizures.  This was not fully accomplished in 
2003 and remains a valid goal for 2004. 
 
Performance:  Burma continues to play a leading role in the 
regional traffic of ATS.  Drug gangs based in the Burma/China 
and Burma/Thailand border areas annually produce several 
hundred million methamphetamine tablets for markets in 
Thailand, China, and India.  In 2003 there were troubling 
signs that a nascent domestic market for ATS began to emerge 
in Burma, although deteriorating economic conditions could 
stifle significant growth in consumption. The UNODC estimated 
that in 2003 there were at least 15,000 regular ATS users in 
Burma. 
 
GOB authorities dismantled two ATS labs in early 2004.  In 
2003 ATS seizures totaled just over 4 million tablets and for 
the first quarter of 2004 authorities seized less than a half 
a million tablets.  These seizures represent a steep decline 
from previous modest levels of approximately 10 million 
tablets seized in 2002 and over 30 million seized in 2001. 
The GOB believes that its cooperation with the DEA and with 
neighboring countries, as well as intense counterdrug 
measures undertaken in Thailand and in China, may have 
reduced the regional market for Burma-produced ATS.  These 
pressures may have also forced drug gangs to change their 
modus operandi, including a reduction in overall production 
and a shift toward more sophisticated trafficking methods and 
routes that overwhelm Burma\'s meager detection capacity. 
However, the major manufacturers and traffickers of ATS, 
mostly ethnic Chinese, continue to operate in Burma\'s remote 
border areas under the control of armed, former insurgent 
groups and therefore of limited access to central government 
authorities.  The Burmese government has yet to put 
significant pressure on the ethnic Kokang and Wa authorities 
in these areas to cease ATS drug production or trafficking. 
 
General/additional comments:  Burma\'s performance has been 
very solid in reducing the cultivation of poppy and the 
production of opium.  In 2003, Burma cultivated less than one 
quarter of the poppy grown in Afghanistan and produced 83 
percent less opium.  Since 1994, Burma has reduced its 
cultivation of poppy by 69 percent and, over the past ten 
years, the production of opium has shrunk by 76 percent. 
According to preliminary results of the latest UN survey and 
the most recent U.S.-Burma joint opium yield survey, the 
trend of declining cultivation and production continued in 
2004.  We assess that progress achieved toward eradicating 
poppy and opium is due to the GOB\'s eradication efforts and 
enforcement of poppy-free zones, cooperation with donors on 
alternative development, a sharp shift towards synthetic 
drugs in consumer countries, and, at times, poor weather. 
B. Consumption/demand reduction 
------------------------------- 
 
General comments:  The overall level of drug abuse is low in 
Burma compared with neighboring countries, in part because 
many Burmese cannot afford a drug habit.  According to the 
GOB, since 1993 there have been only about 80,000 \"officially 
registered\" drug abusers in Burma.  However, the UNODC 
estimates that there may be some 300,000 people who currently 
abuse drugs in Burma.  Most drug users smoke opium, but use 
of heroin is rising, particularly in urban and mining areas. 
Synthetics are increasingly available and cheap, making these 
drugs accessible to a growing segment of the population. 
 
Burmese demand reduction programs are in part coercive and in 
part voluntary.  Addicts are required to register with the 
GOB and can be prosecuted if they fail to register and accept 
treatment.  There are six major drug treatment centers under 
the Ministry of Health, 49 other smaller detox centers, and 
eight rehabilitation centers which, together, have reportedly 
provided treatment to about 55,000 addicts over the past ten 
years.  The UNODC also operates a limited detox program and 
there are a variety of narcotics awareness programs conducted 
through the public school system.  In addition, the 
government has established demand reduction programs in 
cooperation with NGOs, including programs with CARE, World 
Concern, and Population Services International (PSI). 
 
Burma, in cooperation with UNODC, has an effective public 
relations campaign which taps celebrities and well-known 
athletes to promote drug-free living.  The joint GOB-UNDOC 
\"Civil Society Initiative\" (CSI), which also partnered with 
NGOs, held a successful anti-drug concert and marathon in 
2002.  However, the GOB failed to support a two-day music 
festival in 2003, which was subsequently canceled due to 
political concerns over crowd control.  The GOB visibly 
advertises its serious penalties for drug-related violations 
of the law, including the death penalty for trafficking of 
illicit substances. 
 
C. Trafficking 
-------------- 
 
Specific Goal: In 2003, the USG and others in the 
international community urged to GOB to create a special task 
force of police and prosecutors to target and investigate 
high-level drug traffickers and drug trafficking groups. 
This was partially accomplished in 2003.  A more appropriate 
benchmark for 2004 will be the effective use of these 
existing mechanisms for the arrest and prosecution of top 
drug traffickers (see section E). 
 
Performance:  Drug enforcement efforts in Burma are led by 
the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), which 
is comprised of personnel from the police, customs, military 
intelligence, and the army.  CCDAC now has 21 
drug-enforcement task force units around the country, with 
most located in major cities and along key transit routes 
near Burma\'s borders with China, India, and Thailand.  CCDAC 
plans to open a new task force unit in Myawadi on the Thai 
border in late 2004.  In 2002, CCDAC established its own 
Financial Investigation Unit (FIU) and, in 2003 and 2004, 
this entity initiated 8 cases leading to 26 arrests and the 
seizure of roughly $1.3 million in assets. 
 
CCDAC\'s units are under funded and badly equipped. 
Nevertheless, we assess that Burma has the capacity to move 
effectively against high-level drug traffickers and drug 
trafficking groups (see Section E).  However, the central 
government lacks the political will to move aggressively 
against former insurgent groups, like the United Wa State 
Army and others implicated in the drug trade, for fear of 
re-igniting the insurgencies that devastated eastern Burma 
for so many decades before 1989. 
 
In 1997, the Eastern Shan State Army of Sai Lin promised to 
end opium production in its cease-fire area and did so.  In 
2000, the Kokang Chinese broke their pledge to end opium 
production and Burmese and Chinese governments subsequently 
mounted intense counter-narcotics operations.  In 2003, as a 
result, opium production in the Kokang Chinese capital 
district of Lawkai was a fraction of its level two years 
earlier.  In 2005, the United Wa State Army is scheduled to 
end opium production.  However, opium yield surveys in recent 
years indicate that poppy cultivation in northern Wa 
territories is actually increasing. 
 
D. Illicit crop eradication/substitution 
---------------------------------------- 
 
Specific Goal: In 2003, the USG and the UNODC requested that 
the GOB facilitate the participation of independent monitors 
to verify poppy eradication and other counternarcotics 
efforts.  This was accomplished in 2003 and again in 2004 and 
remains a valid, ongoing objective. 
 
Performance:  Burma cooperates with the United States on its 
annual opium yield survey and with the UNODC on census 
surveys of poppy cultivation and opium production.  In fact, 
all recent estimates of opium and heroin production in Burma 
have been compiled by the United States and the United 
Nations on the basis of these surveys.  The U.S. and Burma 
conducted joint opium yield surveys in 1993, 1995, and 
annually from 1997 through 2004, giving both governments an 
accurate understanding of the scope, magnitude, and changing 
geographic distribution of Burma\'s opium crop.  In 2004, the 
UNODC survey extended beyond Shan State to include rapid 
assessments in Sagaing Division, Chin State, and Kachin 
States. 
 
General/additional comments:  The government has eradicated 
more than 35,000 hectares of opium poppy over the past three 
crop years.  Despite a recent decline in annual rates, 
overall eradication accounts for nearly half of the reduction 
in area under poppy cultivation since 2001. 
 
The most significant multilateral effort in support of 
substitution efforts is the UNODC\'s Wa Alternative 
Development Project (WADP), which is financed by the United 
States, Japan, and Germany.  A five-year, $12.1 million 
program, this supply-reduction project encourages alternative 
development in a small portion of the territory controlled by 
the United Wa State Army.  UNODC extended the project from 
2003 until 2005 and expanded the number of villages targeted 
for community development work from 4 to 16.  Also in 2003, 
the UNODC and the Japanese government announced plans to 
establish an intervention in the Wa and Kokang areas (dubbed 
\"KOWI\"), aimed at supporting the humanitarian needs of 
farmers who have abandoned poppy cultivation. 
 
Bilateral counternarcotics projects include a small, 
U.S.-financed substitution project in northern Shan State 
(Project Old Soldier) and a substantial Japanese effort to 
establish buckwheat as a cash crop in the Kokang and Mong Ko 
regions of northeastern Shan State.  The Thai government has 
since 2001 extended its own alternative development projects 
across the border into the Wa-controlled Southern Military 
Region of Shan State. 
 
E. Interdiction and law enforcement cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
Specific Goal:  In 2003, the USG and others in the 
international community urged the GOB to arrest and prosecute 
the senior leadership of heroin and methamphetamine 
trafficking organizations.  This was partially accomplished 
in 2003 and remains a valid objective for 2004. 
 
Performance: More than 96,000 persons have been arrested for 
narcotics-related offenses in Burma over the past 16 years, 
of which nearly 56,000 have been convicted and sentenced. 
Burmese courts have sentenced over 14,000 of these offenders 
to 10 years or more in prison and sentenced to death 58 of 
the most significant traffickers and producers.  Preliminary 
data indicate that Burma arrested just under 1,000 suspects 
in drug-related cases during the first three months of 2004, 
of which 889 were prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced. 
 
Many of these arrests and convictions involved major drug 
syndicates.  Many also involved close cooperation with 
U.S., Australian, and other regional law enforcement 
agencies, including China, India, and Thailand.  Among the 
most notable were the following: 
 
-- In March 2004, a joint cross-border investigation 
involving Burmese and Chinese authorities, and the DEA, led 
to the arrest in Burma of one major Burmese heroin 
trafficker, Yan Shuk Lon, and in China of three major Chinese 
heroin traffickers.  Burma is prosecuting Yan Shuk Lon for 
the trafficking of over two metric tons of heroin which were 
seized in China. 
 
-- Ongoing cooperation with the United States and China in 
the investigation of the \"1-2-5\" syndicate, which led to the 
arrest of 28 persons in the United States, Hong Kong, China, 
and India in May 2003.  Reportedly, this group had been 
responsible for the export of more than $100 million in 
heroin to the United States since 2000. 
 
-- Ongoing cooperation with China in a series of arrests and 
seizures that have continued through 2004 along the Chinese 
border following the signature of a Chinese/Burmese MOU on 
counternarcotics operations in January 2001.  Since then, 
Burma has turned over 60 fugitives to China, including 
members of one group (Tan Xiao Lin and company) which China 
described as the \"largest armed drug-trafficking gang in the 
Golden Triangle.\" 
 
Despite these accomplishments, Burma has failed to bring to 
justice several high-profile individuals known for their 
current or past drug trafficking activities, including Khun 
Sa and Wei Hsueh-kang, both of whom are under indictment in 
the United States. 
 
F. Asset Seizure 
---------------- 
 
General comments: There have been no known seizures made yet 
under the 2002 anti-money laundering law.  However, under a 
1986 law on the ownership of properties obtained by unlawful 
means, the Bureau for Special Investigations (BSI) has opened 
41 cases, arrested 16 individuals, and seized roughly $2.3 
million in assets.  Under the 1993 Narcotic Drug and 
Psychotropic Law, the CCDAC\'s Financial Investigation Unit 
has, since 2002, opened 8 cases, made 26 arrests, and seized 
$1.3 million in assets.  Under that same 1993 law, CCDAC\'s 
central headquarters has over the past decade opened 1,694 
cases, made over 2,000 arrests, and seized an additional $1.3 
million in assets.  In September 2003, the CCDAC obtained a 
court order to freeze all savings and checking accounts of 
all defendants and possible co-conspirators linked to a 
heroin seizure in Suva, Fiji in 2000.  According to GOB 
authorities, Burma has seized more assets in the last two 
years than over the previous ten years. 
 
G. Extradition and mutual legal assistance 
------------------------------------------ 
 
Specific Goal: In 2003, the USG and UNODC urged the GOB to 
amend Burma\'s substantive and procedural criminal laws to 
facilitate effective investigation and prosecution of major 
drug traffickers.  This was accomplished in early 2004, 
although a new mutual assistance law has yet to be tested.  A 
more appropriate benchmark for 2004-2005 will be the full 
implementation and application of the new law. 
 
Performance: The GOB passed a \"Mutual Assistance in Criminal 
Matters Law\" in April 2004.  The law, written largely by 
UNODC, establishes a framework for the GOB to cooperate with 
law enforcement agencies from all countries, even those with 
whom Burma does not have a mutual legal assistance treaty. 
The new law does not cover extradition, but could facilitate 
cooperation on narcotics and other cases.  However, we remain 
concerned with some provisions of the law that give the SPDC 
veto power over cooperation decisions without requiring an 
explanation.  There is also some confusion over whether the 
law is actually in effect pending implementing regulations. 
 
H. Drug treatment 
----------------- 
 
See Section B above on consumption/demand reduction. 
 
I. Control of precursor/essential chemicals 
------------------------------------------- 
 
Specific Goal: In 2003, the USG and others in the 
international community urged the GOB to establish an 
effective program for the control of precursor chemicals. 
This was only partially addressed in 2003 and remains a valid 
objective for 2004. 
 
Performance:  Burma acceded to the 1988 UN Convention on the 
Control of Chemicals in 1991, but did not establish a 
Precursor Control Committee until 1998.  This committee 
issued a notification in 2002 identifying 25 chemical 
substances as precursor chemicals, including several not 
prescribed by the UN Convention, and prohibiting their 
import, sale, or use in Burma.   In January 2003, Burma held 
its first trilateral conference with India and China on 
precursor chemicals and later expanded to include Laos and 
Thailand.  This multilateral group met in May 2004 and will 
meet again in India in 2005.  As a result of this 
cooperation, India and China have taken steps to divert 
precursor chemicals away from Burma\'s border areas; India has 
added ephedrine to a 100-mile wide exclusion zone for acetic 
anhydride along its border with Burma; and Burma is 
encouraging India to add caffeine to this list.  Burma also 
participates in a UNODC regional project on the \"Control of 
Precursor Chemicals in East Asia.\" 
 
General/additional comments:  Precursors for refining these 
narcotic drugs are primarily produced in India, China, and 
Thailand.  Burma does not have a chemical industry and does 
not produce ephedrine, acetic anhydride, or any of the other 
chemicals required for the narcotics trade.  Similarly, the 
major markets for all of these narcotic drugs lie in 
neighboring states.  However, there were signs in 2003 that 
Burma\'s small domestic market for drug consumption grew, 
especially the consumption of ATS. 
 
Seizures of precursor chemicals declined substantially in 
2003 and included 308 kilos of ephedrine (down 82 percent 
from 2002), 2,562 liters of acetic anhydride (down 80 percent 
from two years prior), and 37,000 liters of other precursor 
chemicals (also down nearly 80 percent from two years prior). 
 Preliminary statistics for the first quarter of 2004 
indicate a continuing decline in seizures.  GOB authorities 
believes that seizures of precursors have declined for the 
same reasons seizures of ATS have declined, namely that 
various pressures may have reduced the regional market for 
Burma-produced ATS and also forced drug gangs to shift toward 
more sophisticated trafficking methods and routes that 
overwhelm Burma\'s meager detection capacity (see Section A). 
 
J. Money Laundering 
------------------- 
 
Specific Goals: In 2003, UNODC and the Financial Action Task 
Force, of which the U.S. is a member, requested that the GOB: 
1) fully implement and enforce Burma\'s money-laundering 
legislation; and 2) take effective measures to stem the flow 
of illicit drug money into the banking system and economic 
enterprises and to end joint economic ventures with the 
leaders of drug trafficking organizations.  This was only 
partially accomplished in 2003 and remains a valid objective 
for 2004. 
 
Performance:  In November 2003 the multilateral Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF) asked its members to impose 
countermeasures on Burma for failure to implement the GOB\'s 
2002 anti-money laundering statute and to introduce a mutual 
legal assistance law.  In December 2003, the GOB issued the 
money laundering regulations; in January 2004 it set 
reporting threshold amounts for bank and real estate 
transactions; and in April 2004 it passed mutual legal 
assistance legislation.  The money laundering regulations 
established an interagency Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) 
and a mechanism for banks and realtors to report, and the 
government to investigate, large or suspicious transactions. 
Though the regulations as written are generally good, some 
aspects are troubling, such as an unusually high threshold 
amount for suspicious transactions (roughly $115,000).  We 
also remain concerned about the GOB\'s ability, and to a 
lesser degree willingness, to enforce its new money 
laundering regulations.  Corruption, rampant tax evasion, and 
ill-equipped law enforcers and banking regulators will weigh 
against proper enforcement. 
 
As of May 2004, the FIU had received 638 cash/property 
transaction reports but zero suspicious transaction reports. 
These reports have yet to lead to any investigations by the 
FIU.  Investigations launched in December 2003 into the money 
laundering activities of two private banks (Asia Wealth and 
Myanmar Mayflower) are moribund. 
Burma\'s private banking system is slowly recovering from a 
massive crisis in February 2003.  As of May 2004, all but 
three of the country\'s 20 private banks had resumed 
operations, though under far stricter Central Bank 
regulations.  Three of the four largest pre-crash banks, Asia 
Wealth, Myanmar Mayflower, and Yoma, remain alive but out of 
action with no prospect for re-opening.  Even with the slow 
re-emergence of the private banking system, unregulated 
financial flows remain the rule.  Informal \"hundi/hawallah\" 
financial remittance systems remain very active both for 
domestic and international transactions.  Though the real 
estate bubble of 2001-03 has popped, immovable property (both 
commercial and residential) remains a popular destination for 
illicit cash.  Likewise, gems smuggled to China or Thailand 
continue to be a popular method for remitting dirty money 
from Burma.  Drug trafficking organizations have large and 
lucrative business enterprises, including construction, light 
manufacturing, mining, and banking. 
 
(2) PERFORMANCE IN ACCOMPLISHING GOALS DESCRIBED IN ANY 
APPLICABLE MULTILATERAL NARCOTICS AGREEMENT 
 
Burma\'s official 15-year counternarcotics plan calls for the 
eradication of all narcotics production and trafficking by 
2014, one year ahead of an ASEAN-wide plan of action that 
calls for the region to be drug-free by 2015. The plan is to 
proceed by stages, with eradication efforts coupled to 
alternative development programs in individual townships, 
predominantly in Shan State. Altogether, the GOB identified 
54 townships for the programs and targeted 25 of them during 
the first five years of the program. 
 
(3) PERFORMANCE IN PREVENTING AND PUNISHING PUBLIC CORRUPTION 
 
Although there are many reports and much speculation, there 
is no definitive evidence that senior officials in the 
Burmese Government are directly involved in the drug trade. 
However, lower level officials, particularly army and police 
personnel posted in outlying areas, are widely believed to be 
involved in facilitating the drug trade and some officials 
have been prosecuted for drug abuse and/or narcotics-related 
corruption.  According to the Burmese government, over 200 
police officials and 48 Burmese Army personnel were punished 
for narcotics-related corruption or drug abuse between 1995 
and 2003.  Of the 200 police officers, 130 were imprisoned, 
16 were dismissed from the service, 7 were forced to retire, 
and 47 were demoted.  No Burma Army officer over the rank of 
full colonel has ever been prosecuted for drug offenses in 
Burma. 
 
The GOB does not have joint ventures with the leaders of drug 
trafficking organizations.  Rather, it has given corporations 
like the USWA\'s Hong Pang Company outright concessions for 
the operation of a variety of businesses which range from 
farms to ruby mines and other trading and industrial 
establishments.  This has been controversial, both in Burma 
and abroad, but the GOB has argued that such arrangements are 
necessary to give known narcotics trafficking groups an 
alternative source of income and to bring these groups more 
closely under central government control.

SUBJECT: NEW BANGLADESH COMMERCIAL OFFICE: MUCH A-BUZZ 
ABOUT NOTHING? 
 
Classified By: DCM Ronald K. McMullen for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1. (SBU) Pol/Econ Officers paid a courtesy call on newly 
arrived Bangladesh Commercial Counselor Mohammed Aftabuzzaman 
on May 13, 2004.  Aftabuzzaman has been charged with opening 
a commercial office and increasing bilateral trade between 
Burma and Bangladesh, which he characterized as currently 
insignificant.  Existing trade is focused on pharmaceuticals 
and agricultural products, although Aftabuzzaman had no 
Bangladesh statistics on trade volume, claiming that the 
numbers were in Dhaka but had not been sent to him.  As a 
result, Aftabuzzaman had spent his first several weeks 
in-country trying to collect statistical information, 
observing that the GOB seemed reluctant to share any customs 
and trade data, and that his meetings with various 
ministries/departments had not resulted in needed 
information.  Aftabuzzaman seemed perplexed by what he 
described as the GOB,s \"reserve\" about sharing basic 
information. 
 
2. (SBU) When questioned about near-term plans, Aftabuzzaman 
suggested that the first meeting of a joint trade commission 
might be held, but that a date and venue had not been 
determined; a visit by the new Bangladesh Commerce Minister 
also was a possibility.  Aftabuzzaman indicated that a trade 
fair that had been scheduled for March was canceled due to 
lack of interest on the part of Bangladeshi businessmen, but 
had little else to offer on this topic.  Aftabuzzaman said a 
future trade fair was possible, although nothing was being 
planned currently.  Aftabuzzaman found it difficult to 
identify current obstacles to more vigorous bilateral trade 
between Bangladesh and Burma, again commenting on his 
difficulty in getting customs and other data from his own and 
the Burmese government. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  This is Aftabuzzaman,s, a career Ministry 
of Finance auditor, first overseas assignment.  He seems to 
have been set adrift by his own government, arriving here 
with little in the way of marching orders and background, and 
is now confronting yet another impasse as he seeks to engage 
with host-country officials to collect trade data.  End 
comment.

SUBJECT: BURMESE TAKE TO THE ETHER TO AVOID SANCTIONS 
 
REF: A. RANGOON 138 
     B. 03 RANGOON 1337 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: BURMESE BUSINESSES HAVE A WELL-EARNED 
REPUTATION FOR CREATIVITY IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES.  MANY 
HAVE FOUND WAYS TO WORK AROUND LAST YEAR\'S BAN ON U.S. 
FINANCIAL SERVICES (INCLUDING TRADE FACILITATION AND CREDIT 
CARD SERVICES).  ONE OF THE LATEST METHODS INVOLVES LARGER 
COMPANIES USING OFFSHORE AFFILIATES AND THIRD-PARTY 
FACILITATORS TO OFFER CREDIT CARD SERVICES IN RANGOON. 
THOUGH WE CAN\'T SAY IF THIS SCHEME LEADS TO VIOLATIONS OF 
U.S. SANCTIONS, IT SURELY CIRCUMVENTS THEM AND IS CONTRARY TO 
THE DESIRES OF THE MAJOR U.S. CREDIT CARD FIRMS WHO LAST 
SUMMER ANNOUNCED THEY WOULD SUSPEND THEIR BURMA OPERATIONS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
ADAPT, ADOPT, AND IMPROVE 
 
2. (SBU) DESPITE U.S. SANCTIONS THAT PROHIBIT U.S. PERSONS 
FROM PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THE DECISION BY 
MASTERCARD, VISA, AND AMERICAN EXPRESS TO SUSPEND THEIR 
OPERATIONS IN BURMA, MANY HOTELS, SHOPS, AND TRAVEL AGENCIES 
AROUND RANGOON ARE STILL ACCEPTING CREDIT CARDS.  MOST ARE 
NOT KEEN TO DO SO, TAKING A CARD FROM A CUSTOMER ONLY IN A 
PINCH.  HOWEVER, OTHERS ADVERTISE AGGRESSIVELY THAT 
\"MASTERCARD AND VISA ARE ACCEPTED!\" 
 
3. (SBU) HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?  AS REPORTED NUMEROUS TIMES 
(REFTELS), BURMESE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY DEVIOUS IN 
FINDING WORK-AROUNDS TO MINIMIZE THE DISRUPTION OF VARIOUS 
SANCTIONS.  AS ONE BUSINESSMAN TOLD US WHEN THE NEW U.S. 
SANCTIONS TOOK EFFECT IN JULY 2003, \"WE\'VE HAD SANCTIONS FROM 
OUR OWN GOVERNMENT FOR FORTY YEARS.  YOURS WILL HAVE LITTLE 
EFFECT.\"  SOME TRADERS, PREVENTED FROM USING U.S. DOLLAR 
LETTERS OF CREDIT WITH A BURMESE BANK, ARE NOW USING AN 
ELABORATE ACCOUNT SETTLEMENT PROCESS THAT OCCURS IN OFFSHORE 
BANKS (MOSTLY IN SINGAPORE).  OTHERS ARE SHIFTING AS MUCH AS 
POSSIBLE TO BORDER TRADE AND ITS CASH-BASED TRANSACTIONS. 
NEARLY ALL USE AN ALREADY ACTIVE INFORMAL REMITTANCE SYSTEM 
(CALLED \"HUNDI\" OR \"HAWALLAH\") TO MAKE AND RECEIVE U.S. 
DOLLAR PAYMENTS. 
 
THE MAGIC OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY 
 
4. (SBU) THE HOTELS, SHOPS, AND SERVICES THAT ARE ACCEPTING 
PLASTIC AGAIN IN RANGOON ARE RELYING PRIMARILY ON MERCHANT 
ACCOUNTS SET UP OFFSHORE OR BY INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.  IN 
THE FORMER CASE, AN ENTITY IN RANGOON THAT HAS A CORPORATE 
PARENT OR SUBSIDIARY WITH A MERCHANT ACCOUNT IN A BANK 
OUTSIDE BURMA CAN PHONE IN NUMBERS OR DELIVER CREDIT CARD 
SLIPS TO THEIR AFFILIATE FOR PROCESSING.  THE SETTLEMENT, AS 
FAR AS THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY AND U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS 
CONCERNED, IS BETWEEN THE MERCHANT ACCOUNT IN SINGAPORE, 
BANGKOK, OR HONG KONG AND THE CUSTOMER\'S ACCOUNT IN NEW YORK, 
FRANKFURT, OR LONDON. 
 
5. (SBU) IT\'S NOT CLEAR EXACTLY HOW THE LATTER LOOPHOLE WORKS 
-- WHETHER THE BUSINESS CAN CONTRACT WITH AN ONLINE COMPANY 
(SUCH AS WORLDPAY) DIRECTLY OR WHETHER IT MUST DO SO UNDER 
THE NAME OF ITS OFFSHORE AFFILIATE.  WHICHEVER THE CASE, SOME 
ARE USING THESE THIRD-PARTY SERVICES TO PROVIDE MERCHANT 
ACCOUNTS AND SETTLEMENT SERVICES. 
 
COMMENT: ILLEGAL OR INEVITABLE? 
 
6. (SBU) THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE BURMESE COMPANIES\' 
ACTIVITIES LEAD TO VIOLATIONS OF U.S. SANCTIONS OR WHETHER 
THEY ARE MERELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A LEGAL LOOPHOLE TO 
CONTINUE SOME MEASURE OF BUSINESS AS USUAL.  IN ANY EVENT, WE 
THINK IT WORTHWHILE TO INFORM THE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES THAT 
THEIR SERVICES ARE BEING OFFERED IN BURMA DESPITE THEIR 
INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY.  THEY CAN, IN TURN, INFORM 
THEIR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS THAT TRANSACTIONS THEY ARE 
FACILITATING MAY BE INDIRECTLY SENDING MONEY TO BURMA.  END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT: ACTIVISTS ARRESTED ON ANNIVERSARY OF DEPAYIN 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CDA A.I., RONALD K. MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY: ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
REGIME-ORCHESTRATED ATTACK ON THE NLD AT DEPAYIN ON MAY 30, 
2003, THE REGIME ARRESTED AT LEAST NINE VERIFIED AND POSSIBLY 
DOZENS MORE YOUTHS INVOLVED IN DISTRIBUTING COPIES OF THE UN 
UNIVERSAL DECLARATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS.  THE NLD HELD 
RELIGIOUS SERVICES IN RANGOON AND MANDALAY TO COMMEMORATE THE 
ATTACK, BUT IN GENERAL THE ANNIVERSARY PASSED UNOBSERVED BY 
THE GENERAL POPULATION.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (C) THE BURMESE REGIME ARRESTED AT LEAST NINE VERIFIED 
AND POSSIBLY DOZENS MORE OF THE 43 PRO-DEMOCRACY YOUTHS WHO 
WERE HANDING OUT BURMESE-LANGUAGE COPIES OF THE UN UNIVERSAL 
DECLARATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ON MAY 30 IN AN ORGANIZED 
COMMEMORATION OF THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE REGIME\'S 
ATTACK ON AUNG SAN SUU KYI AND HER NLD RETINUE AT DEPAYIN. 
THE 34 YOUTHS STILL NOT ACCOUNTED FOR ARE EITHER IN HIDING OR 
HAVE ALSO BEEN ARRESTED BY THE AUTHORITIES.  MOST OF THE 
YOUTHS ARE NLD MEMBERS, WHO REPORTEDLY HANDED OUT THE 
LEAFLETS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION OF THE NLD 
CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  THE DEMONSTRATORS HAD NOTIFIED 
THE UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE BY LETTER ON MAY 28 THAT THE 
2003 ATTACK WAS A VIOLATION OF SECTION 20, PARA ONE OF THE 
DECLARATION, AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HELP THE UN\'S 
MISSION IN BURMA BY DISTRIBUTING THE PAMPHLETS. 
 
3.  (C) TWO U.S. EMBASSY LOCAL STAFF WITNESSED SEVERAL OF THE 
ARRESTS AND REPORTED THAT THE MI OFFICERS BADLY BEAT TWO OF 
THE YOUTHS, HITTING THEM IN THE FACE AND BODY DESPITE 
REPEATED ENTREATIES FROM THE YOUTHS TO STOP.  FOUR BYSTANDERS 
CAUGHT READING THE PAMPHLETS WERE ALSO ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO 
A POLICE STATION, BUT WERE LATER RELEASED.  THE NLD YOUTHS 
WERE ALL WEARING KACHIN LONGYIS (OFTEN WORN BY PRO-DEMOCRACY 
ACTIVISTS OF ANY ETHNICITY) AND TEE SHIRTS WITH A PICTURE OF 
UNIFORMED GENERAL AUNG SAN WITH THE TITLE \"INDEPENDENCE 
LEADER\" ON THE FRONT AND \"FREEDOM FROM FEAR\" WRITTEN ON THE 
BACK IN BURMESE. 
 
4.  (C) THE NLD OFFICIALLY OBSERVED THE DEPAYIN ANNIVERSARY 
WITH A PRIVATE RELIGIOUS SERVICE FOR ABOUT 100 MEMBERS AND 
SUPPORTERS IN A NORTHERN RANGOON SUBURB AND FOR ABOUT 100 
MORE AT A BUDDHIST MONASTERY IN MANDALAY.  IN A SEPARATE 
INCIDENT, POLICE ARRESTED ONE WOMAN IN THE PARK ACROSS THE 
STREET FROM THE EMBASSY ONLY A FEW MINUTES AFTER SHE BEGAN 
CHANTING PRO-NLD SLOGANS AND CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF ASSK 
AND U TIN OO. 
 
5.  (C) THE REGIME HAD BEEN ON A HEIGHTENED SECURITY ALERT 
FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK LEADING UP TO THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
ATTACK, POSTING SEVERAL ADDITIONAL NATIONAL ARMED POLICE 
COMPANIES IN COMBAT GEAR AT FIVE LOCATIONS IN RANGOON. 
ACCORDING TO THE ORGANIZER OF THE EVENT, THUREIN AUNG, WHO 
WENT UNDERGROUND SHORTLY AFTER THE ARRESTS, THE FOLLOWING IS 
A PARTIAL LIST OF THOSE ARRESTED: 
 
1. MYO THAN HTET (NLD TAMWE) 
2. MYINT KYAW OO (NLD SHWE PYI THAR TOWNSHIP) 
3. MYO MIN WAI    (NLD SHWE PYI THAR TOWNSHIP) 
4. MYO MIN SOE (NLD KAMAYUT TOWNSHIP) 
5. NE SOE (NLD SHWE PYI THA TOWNSHIP) 
6. KYAW KYAW (NLD DAGON MYO THIT TOWNSHIP) 
7. THAN WIN AUNG (NLD DAGON MYO THIT TOWNSHIP) 
8. MYO MIN (NLD MAYANGONE TOWNSHIP) 
9. MYO MIN MAUNG (NLD KUNCHANGONE TOWNSHIP) 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT: THE REGIME HAS BEEN VERY SENSITIVE TO ANY 
PUBLIC MENTION OF THE DEPAYIN ATTACK, AND WAS EVIDENTLY QUITE 
PREPARED TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PREVENT ANY SMALL CORE OF 
NLD SUPPORTERS FROM SPARKING A GENERAL DEMONSTRATION AGAINST 
THE REGIME.  THAT THE REGIME WOULD ARREST ANYONE FOR HANDING 
OUT A UN PUBLICATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AGAIN UNDERLINES THE 
MORAL TURPITUDE OF THIS GOVERNMENT.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: VIEWS FROM THE THREE RING NATIONAL CONVENTION 
 
REF: RANGOON 637 AND PREVIOUS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: DCM RON MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: AFTER A THREE WEEK LOCKDOWN AT THE NATIONAL 
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, 700 DELEGATES GOT A WEEKEND PASS 
FOR JUNE 5-6.  DESPITE THIS RELEASE, NEWS FROM NYAUNG HNA PIN 
HAS BEEN SCARCE.  SOME SECOND AND THIRD-HAND TALES HAVE BEEN 
TRICKLING OUT ATTESTING TO THE FARCICAL AND PRE-ORDAINED 
NATURE OF THE EVENT.  THE ANECDOTES DON\'T SHOWER MUCH GLORY 
ON THE REGIME OR THE CONSTITUTIONAL DELEGATES.  THERE ARE 
PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT SOME OF THE CEASE-FIRE GROUPS WILL 
HOLD OUT FOR \"REAL REFORM.\"  HOWEVER, WE SEE LITTLE CHANCE 
THAT THESE GROUPS WILL GIVE UP THEIR CURRENT ECONOMIC BIRD IN 
THE HAND.  IN ANY EVENT, IT\'S UNLIKELY THE SPDC WILL GIVE 
THESE GROUPS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANY MEANINGFUL 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CONVENTION PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TALES OUT OF SCHOOL 
 
2. (C) PAGING JAMES MADISON:  THE SPDC ORDERED A PRESTIGIOUS 
BURMESE EX-AMBASSADOR TO THE CONVENTION SITE TO ADD SOME 
GRAVITAS TO THE EARLY PROCEEDINGS.  WHEN SUBSEQUENTLY 
RELEASED FROM DUTY, HE COMPLAINED TO A FRIEND THAT THE 
DELEGATES THE SPDC HAND-SELECTED WERE \"RUFFIANS,\" WITH NO 
POLITICAL SAVVY OR SERIOUS UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR 
RESPONSIBILITIES. 
 
-- (C) THE LIVING IS EASY, PART 1: ONE ETHNIC KARENNI 
DELEGATE CONTACTED HIS FRIEND DESPERATELY ASKING FOR ONE 
MILLION KYAT (ABOUT US$1,100).  THOUGH HE HAD COME TO THE 
CONVENTION WITH A FAT ROLL OF CASH, THE REPRESENTATIVE HAD 
SPENT IT ALL GAMBLING WITH FELLOW DELEGATES AND TAKING 
ADVANTAGE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT -- MASSAGES, KARAOKE, SHOPPING 
-- SET UP ON-SITE BY THE REGIME TO MOLLIFY THE CAPTIVES.  THE 
DELEGATE HAD ALSO ASKED FOR A SHIPMENT OF 30 GAMEBOYS, \"TO 
PASS THE TIME WHILE ALL THOSE OTHERS ARE TALKING AND TALKING.\" 
 
-- (C) THE LIVING IS EASY, PART 2: RUMOR HAS IT THAT LEGIONS 
OF YOUNG FEMALE \"ASSISTANTS\" HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO THE 
CONVENTION SITE TO PROVIDE EXTRACURRICULAR SERVICES TO THE 
WEARY DELEGATES. 
 
-- (C) LOOK AND SIGN: ONE ETHNIC DELEGATE COMPLAINED TO HIS 
FRIEND THAT THE ATTENDANT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAD MADE IT 
CLEAR THAT THE DELEGATES WERE NOT EXPECTED TO DISCUSS OR 
CONTRIBUTE BUT MERELY TO \"HTAUK PI HTOU\" (\"REVIEW AND SIGN\") 
THE FINAL, PRE-COOKED DOCUMENTS ULTIMATELY PRESENTED THEM. 
 
COMMENT: A BIRD IN THE HAND 
 
3. (C) RUMORS PERSIST THAT SOME OF THE BETTER ORGANIZED 
CEASE-FIRE POLITICAL GROUPS, SUCH AS THE KACHIN INDEPENDENCE 
ORGANIZATION, WILL HOLD OUT AT THE CONVENTION FOR SOME REAL 
REFORM.  THERE WAS EVEN SOME HOPE, UNREALIZED, THAT SOME OF 
THE ETHNIC DELEGATES WOULD REFUSE TO RETURN TO THE CONVENTION 
AFTER THEIR WEEKEND GETAWAY.  SUPPOSEDLY THESE GROUPS ARE 
GETTING PRESSURE TO DELIVER WHAT THEY\'D BEEN PROMISING SINCE 
THEIR RESPECTIVE CEASE-FIRES -- SOME MEASURE OF AUTONOMY. 
 
4. (C) WE THINK THESE RUMORS WILL REMAIN JUST THAT SINCE THE 
CEASE-FIRE GROUPS ARE UNLIKELY TO BREAK WITH THE SPDC, AND 
RISK LOSING ECONOMIC BENEFITS THEY RECEIVE FROM THE REGIME, 
OVER THE HYPOTHETICAL POLITICAL FORM OF A FUTURE BURMA. 
UNLESS THEY\'RE WILLING TO RESUME FIGHTING THE GOVERNMENT THE 
CEASE-FIRE GROUPS HAVE LITTLE LEVERAGE WITH AN SPDC THAT IS 
FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF THE NC.  HOWEVER, CEASE-FIRE GROUPS HAVE 
ADMITTED THEY AREN\'T PREPARING FOR A RETURN TO ARMED 
CONFLICT, SO IT IS LIKELY THEY WILL ACCEPT WHATEVER THE SPDC 
HANDS THEM AT THE CONVENTION.  END COMMENT.

CLASSIFIED BY: COM CARMEN M. MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  THE NATIONAL CONVENTION (NC) RESUMED JUNE 7 
AFTER A TWO-DAY RECESS.  THOUGH THE SPDC\'S EMPTY PROMISES TO 
RE-EXAMINE THE 104 PRINCIPLES HAVE LEFT THE ETHNIC CEASE-FIRE 
GROUPS (CFGS) RATHER FRUSTRATED, THE CFGS PARADOXICALLY STILL 
HOPE FOR SOME DELIVERABLES ON THE SHARING OF POWER IN THE NEW 
CONSTITUTION.  HOWEVER, THE ETHNICS, WHO HAVE BY DEFAULT 
BECOME THE ONLY VOICE OF POTENTIAL CRITICISM AT THE NC, ADMIT 
THEY EXPECT VERY LITTLE FROM THE NC, WHICH MAY ADJOURN IN 
LATE JUNE FOR A TWO-MONTH BREAK.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BACK ON THE RESERVATION 
 
2.  (C) WEEK FOUR OF THE NATIONAL CONVENTION BEGAN JUNE 7 
WITH ALL DELEGATES RETURNING TO THE NYAUNG HNI PIN NC SITE 
AFTER 700 OF THEM TOOK THEIR FIRST WEEKEND RECESS SINCE THE 
NC STARTED.  CFG REPRESENTATIVES IN RANGOON TELL US THEY ARE 
UNHAPPY THE SPDC HASN\'T ALLOWED OPEN DEBATE OF THE 104 
PRINCIPLES AND SIX OBJECTIVES AS WAS HOPED PRIOR TO THE 
CONVENTION START (REF B). THE NEW MON STATE PARTY (NMSP) AND 
THE KACHIN INDEPENDENCE ORGANIZATION (KIO) CFGS EVEN SENT A 
LETTER TO THE NC COMMISSION ASKING FOR A REVIEW OF THE 104 
PRINCIPLES BUT WERE REBUFFED.  IN THE END THE CFGS AVOIDED 
CONFRONTING THE SPDC, AND THOUGH PREVIOUSLY MUCH-DISCUSSED, 
DID NOT USE THE WEEKEND RECESS TO STAGE A BOYCOTT OR SIT-OUT. 
 
 
WHAT DISSENT CHANNEL? 
 
3.  (C) ETHNIC LEADERS TELL US THAT BY DEFAULT, THE CFGS IN 
THE \"SPECIALLY INVITED GUESTS\" DELEGATE CATEGORY HAVE BECOME 
THE ONLY DELEGATES AT THE NC WILLING TO BE CRITICAL OF THE 
SPDC OR VOICE INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  HOWEVER, ONE DELEGATE IN 
THE \"POLITICAL PARTY\" CATEGORY, AN MP-ELECT EXCOMMUNICATED 
FROM THE NLD, TOLD US HE AND THE OTHER HANDFUL OF EX-NLD 
DELEGATES ARE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE NLD 
DURING THE CONVENTION, SINCE THEY WERE ELECTED ON THE NLD 
TICKET IN 1990.  HOWEVER, UNLIKE THEIR CFG CO-DELEGATES WHO 
CAN COMMUNICATE WITH ETHNIC LEADERS IN RANGOON BY SATELLITE 
PHONE AND COURIER, THESE EX-NLD DELEGATES HAVE HAD NO 
OFFICIAL CONTACT WITH, AND RECEIVE NO INSTRUCTIONS FROM, 
ANYONE OUTSIDE OF THE REMOTE NC COMPOUND. 
 
STATES RIGHTS! 
 
4.  (C) THE 19 CFGS HAVE JOINTLY SIGNED A PAPER TO BE 
SUBMITTED THIS WEEK TO THE NC WORKING COMMITTEE FOR WRITING 
CHAPTERS 4, 5, AND 6 DRAFTING GUIDELINES.  THESE CHAPTERS 
WILL ADDRESS SHARING OF POWER BETWEEN THE STATES AND THE 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE, AND 
JUDICIARY FUNCTIONS.  THE CFGS ARE SEEKING FORMAL AUTONOMY IN 
CULTURE, RELIGION, EDUCATION, AND LAW.  HOWEVER, THE KIO VICE 
CHAIRMAN MAJ GEN ZAU SEIN, DOES NOT REALLY EXPECT THE NC 
WORKING COMMITTEE TO INCORPORATE THE CFGS\' DESIRED LANGUAGE 
IN THE FINAL GUIDELINE PAPER. 
 
5.  (C) UNDER THE SPDC\'S SIX OBJECTIVES AND 104 PRINCIPLES, 
THE DRAFTING GUIDELINES WILL RESERVE 25 PERCENT OF POSITIONS 
IN THE FEDERAL, STATE/DIVISION, DISTRICT, AND TOWNSHIP-LEVEL 
LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE, AND JUDICIAL BODIES FOR MILITARY 
OFFICERS.  IN SPITE OF THIS, KIO LEADERS SAY THEY REMAIN 
HOPEFUL THAT THE SPDC WILL GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO TAKE HOME. 
IF IN THE END THEY DO GO HOME EMPTY-HANDED, THEY \"WILL ASSESS 
THEIR OPTIONS AT THAT TIME.\" IF THE KIO FEELS THE PROCESS TOO 
UNDEMOCRATIC, THEY WILL CONSIDER NOT SENDING A REPRESENTATIVE 
TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL DRAFTING COMMITTEE.  (NOTE: THE NEXT 
STEP, DRAFTING THE CONSTITUTION, IS STEP TWO IN THE \"ROAD MAP 
TO DEMOCRACY.\") 
 
SWIFTLY GO THE DAYS 
 
6. THE SHAN STATE ARMY AND KIO LEADERS TELL US THE NC WORKING 
COMMITTEE WILL REVIEW THE CHAPTERS 4, 5, AND 6 DRAFTING 
GUIDELINE PAPERS AND WILL COMBINE THEM INTO ONE PAPER.  THAT 
FINAL GUIDELINE PAPER WILL BE EDITED BY THE SPDC AND THEN 
PRESENTED TO THE NC PLENARY SESSION IN MID-JUNE FOR \"COMMENT\" 
AND APPROVAL.  THE NC WILL LIKELY THEN ADJOURN FOR A FEW 
MONTHS.  NEXT ON THE NC TO-DO LIST IS WRITING THE DRAFTING 
GUIDELINES FOR CHAPTER 7, WHICH WILL ESTABLISH THE CHIEF OF 
THE ARMED FORCES AS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, AND WILL RESERVE 
THE RIGHT OF THE MILITARY TO TAKE POWER IF THE COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF DEEMS THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY TO BE UNSTABLE. 
 
7.  (C) COMMENT: THE CFGS EVIDENTLY HAVE REALIZED THAT THE 
SHARING-OF-POWER CHAPTERS 4, 5, AND 6 ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT 
TO THEM, AND THEY HOPE THE DRAFTING GUIDELINES WILL CODIFY 
THE LONG-SOUGHT AUTONOMY FOR THEIR ETHNIC STATES.  HOWEVER, 
THEY FULLY ADMIT THEY\'RE UNABLE TO AFFECT SUCH A FAVORABLE 
OUTCOME -- AN ADMISSION THAT THE SR GEN THAN SHWE IS IN FULL 
CONTROL OF THIS PROCESS.  SINCE THERE ARE NO PREPARATIONS FOR 
RESUMING ETHNIC INSURGENCY, MUCH LESS A BOYCOTT OF THE NC, 
FINAL DRAFTING GUIDELINES FOR A STRONG CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND 
WEAK DEPENDENT ETHNIC STATES CONTROLLED BY THE MILITARY SEEMS 
A FOREGONE CONCLUSION.  END COMMENT.

VISIT 
 
REF: RANGOON 719 AND PREVIOUS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: A SURPRISE, BUT WELCOME, MEETING BETWEEN THE 
CHIEF OF MISSION AND THE DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER WAS MORE 
SIGNIFICANT FOR ITS OCCURRENCE THAN ITS CONTENT. 
NONETHELESS, DURING THE CORDIAL 30-MINUTE EXCHANGE THE COM 
PRESSURED FOR A ROLE FOR THE NLD IN THE \"ROAD MAP FOR 
DEMOCRACY,\" AND HEARD VERIFICATION OF GOB INTENTION TO SIGN 
THREE ADDITIONAL UN COUNTERTERRORISM PROTOCOLS, THE LATEST 
GOB PERSPECTIVE ON THE ONGOING NATIONAL CONVENTION, AND 
ASSURANCES THAT THE SPDC REMAINED IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH 
ASSK.  WE HOPE THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY SUCH INFORMAL 
SESSIONS AFTER A LONG STRETCH IN WHICH SENIOR GOB OFFICIALS 
HAVE BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO MEET.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BETTER ON COUNTERTERRORISM 
 
2. (SBU) THE CHIEF OF MISSION (COM) TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE 
FIRST EVER VISIT TO THE EMBASSY BY DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
(DFM) KHIN MAUNG WIN (A 1985 FULBRIGHTER AND GRADUATE OF 
SAIS) TO DISCUSS SEVERAL KEY BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL 
ISSUES.  THE DFM HAD COME ON THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 9TH TO 
SIGN THE PRESIDENT REAGAN CONDOLENCE BOOK (SEPTEL), AND HE 
AGREED (AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF INDECISION) TO COME UPSTAIRS 
FOR A GLASS OF SPRITE.  IT WAS THE FIRST VISIT OF A SENIOR 
GOB OFFICIAL TO THE EMBASSY SINCE A PREVIOUS DFM CAME IN 1994 
TO SIGN THE CONDOLENCE BOOK FOR THE LATE PRESIDENT NIXON. 
THE DCM AND A P/E OFFICER ALSO ATTENDED THE 30 MINUTE 
MEETING. 
 
3. (C) THE CURRENT DFM VERIFIED FOR US WORD WE\'D HEARD LAST 
WEEK THAT BURMA WAS PREPARED TO SIGN THREE MORE OF THE 12 UN 
COUNTERTERRORISM PROTOCOLS.  BURMA IS A SIGNATORY TO EIGHT 
ALREADY, AND WILL LIKELY SIGN THE PROTOCOLS ON HOSTAGES, 
PROTECTED PERSONS, AND PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES BEFORE THE UNGA 
MEETING.  ACCORDING TO THE DFM, THE \"POLITICAL APPROVAL\" FOR 
WAS IN PLACE AND THERE WERE JUST SOME \"PROCESSES\" TO COMPLETE 
BEFORE THE FINAL SIGNING.  WHEN BURMA SIGNS THESE THREE ONLY 
THE SAFEGUARDING OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL PROTOCOL WILL REMAIN 
UNSIGNED. 
 
SAME ON CONVENTION 
 
4. (C) THE DFM BRIEFED ON A FEW KEY POINTS ON THE ONGOING 
NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION (NC).  WHEN THE COM FIRST 
ASKED ABOUT THE DFM\'S ROLE, HE LET SLIP THAT \"THANKFULLY\" HE 
HADN\'T BEEN DRAFTED INTO DAILY ATTENDANCE AT THE PRISON-LIKE 
NC SITE (REFTELS).  HE SAID, THAT THE NC PROCESS WAS MOVING 
ALONG THOUGH HE WOULDN\'T HYPOTHESIZE ON WHEN THE FINAL 
GUIDELINES FOR THE DRAFTING OF THE CONSTITUTION WOULD BE 
COMPLETE. 
 
5. (C) THE COM ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY SIGNIFICANCE TO A 
RECENT SHIFT IN GOB COMMON-USE JARGON FROM NATIONAL 
\"RECONCILIATION\" TO NATIONAL \"RECONSOLIDATION\" WHEN 
DISCUSSING GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO DRAFT THE CONSTITUTION.  HE 
REPLIED THAT THIS WAS INDEED AN INTENTIONAL SHIFT, REFLECTING 
THE GOB\'S DESIRE TO USE A \"STRONGER\" WORD TO DESCRIBE THE 
NEWLY VIGOROUS EFFORT TO NOT JUST RECONCILE ETHNIC AND BURMAN 
GROUPS, BUT MERGE THEM TOGETHER IN A MORE COHESIVE UNION.  TO 
US, THOUGH, IT SEEMS LIKE THE MASK SLIPPING TO REVEAL THE 
GOB\'S REAL CONSTITUTIONAL INTENTIONS: BRING EVERYONE INTO THE 
FOLD WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT. 
 
6. (C) THOUGH THE JARGON HAS CHANGED, THE DFM ADDED, THE GOB 
IS STILL INTENDING TO BE FLEXIBLE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
SPECIFIC DESIRES OF THE ETHNIC CEASE-FIRE GROUP DELEGATES. 
THOUGH THIS FLEXIBILITY MAY EXIST IN PRINCIPLE AND ALONG THE 
MARGINS, WE\'VE SEEN NO EVIDENCE SO FAR THAT THE 
SPDC-CONTROLLED NC IS WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THE CORE DEMANDS 
OF THE CEASE-FIRE GROUPS FOR SOME KIND OF A FEDERAL SYSTEM 
(REFTEL). 
 
WORSE ON ASSK 
 
7. (C) THE COM ASKED WHETHER THE SPDC WAS CONTINUING ITS 
CONTACTS WITH AUNG SAN SUU KYI AND WHETHER OR NOT THE GOB 
VIEWED PARTICIPATION OF THE NLD IN THE NC AS STILL POSSIBLE. 
THE DFM SAID THAT CONTACT WAS ONGOING, THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW 
THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE MEETINGS, BUT THAT IT WAS PROBABLY 
\"TOO LATE\" FOR THE NLD TO PLAY ANY MEANINGFUL ROLE IN THE NC. 
 THE COM CLEARLY TOLD THE DFM THAT NLD PARTICIPATION IN THE 
NC AND THE SPDC\'S \"ROAD MAP FOR DEMOCRACY\" WAS ESSENTIAL FOR 
THE PROCESS TO HAVE ANY LEGITIMACY. 
 
COMMENT: GOOD MEETING, PREDICTABLE CONTENT 
 
8. (C) THOUGH LITTLE GOOD NEWS EMERGED FROM THE SHORT 
DISCUSSION, THE FACT THAT IT OCCURRED WAS VERY POSITIVE. 
NORMALLY THIS KIND OF HIGH-LEVEL MEETING OCCURS ONLY AFTER 
EXTENSIVE PREPARATORY WORK RESULTING IN A VERY STAGED AND 
CANNED EXCHANGE.  THE COM URGED THE DFM TO MAINTAIN MORE OPEN 
AND INFORMAL LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE EMBASSY ON 
IMPORTANT BILATERAL ISSUES.  THE DFM AGREED, AND SEEMED 
EARNEST IN HIS DESIRE TO DO SO.  OF COURSE HE DOES NOT HAVE 
THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE GOOD ON HIS PROMISE.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S IMPORTERS TAKE ANOTHER BLOW 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A PLAN TO STICK IMPORTERS WITH HUGE NEW 
CUSTOMS EXPENSES IS PAR FOR THE COURSE.  IT ADVANCES THE 
GOB\'S DUAL ECONOMIC PRIORITIES -- RAISING REVENUE WITHOUT 
REFORMING THE DECREPIT TAX SYSTEM AND DISCOURAGING IMPORTS. 
THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY IS HARD TO PREDICT.  FLOURISHING 
SMUGGLING AND UNDERINVOICING MAY NEGATE MUCH OF THE BURDEN, 
BUT THERE COULD BE SOME INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SMOOT-HAWLEY BURMA STYLE 
 
2. (SBU) BURMESE AUTHORITIES HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY THE 
COST FOR IMPORTERS BRINGING THEIR PRODUCTS IN LEGALLY.  AS 
USUAL THERE WAS NO WARNING OF THIS MOVE AND NO OFFICIAL 
ANNOUNCEMENT OR EXPLANATION.  HOWEVER, IMPORTERS TELL US THAT 
CUSTOMS OFFICIALS ON JUNE 15TH BEGAN ASSESSING DUTY FOR THEIR 
PRODUCTS AT AN EXCHANGE RATE OF 450 KYAT/$.  PREVIOUSLY THE 
RATE WAS 100 KYAT/$.  THUS, TO BRING IN A $100 PRODUCT 
FACING, SAY, A 5 PERCENT TARIFF THE IMPORTER WOULD HAVE TO 
SHELL OUT 2250 KYAT (ROUGHLY $2.40 AT THE BLACK MARKET RATE) 
IN DUTY RATHER THAN 500 KYAT (ABOUT 55 CENTS) UNDER THE 
PREVIOUS SYSTEM. 
 
3. (SBU) ON TOP OF THIS, THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE HAS RAISED 
TENFOLD THE COMMERCIAL TAX, PAYABLE ON ALL IMPORTED ITEMS 
MEANT FOR RESALE EXCEPT FOR FIVE ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES.  THIS 
TAX WAS REDUCED 90 PERCENT IN 1996 DURING THE LAST ADJUSTMENT 
OF THE CUSTOMS EXCHANGE RATE.  IT HAS NOW BEEN RETURNED TO 
ITS 1996 LEVEL.  THE OVERALL SITUATION FOR IMPORTERS HAS BEEN 
FURTHER EXACERBATED BY A 15 PERCENT DEPRECIATION OF THE KYAT 
OVER THE LAST MONTH (THUS INCREASING THE COST OF \"EXPORT 
DOLLARS\" NEEDED TO APPLY FOR AN IMPORT LICENSE). 
 
4. (SBU) THIS NEW POLICY IS NOT ILLOGICAL (THE GOB NEEDS 
REVENUE AND IMPORTERS HAVE BEEN BENEFITING SINCE 1996 FROM A 
TAX BREAK AND AN EXCHANGE RATE FAR BELOW MARKET LEVEL) AND IT 
FITS WELL INTO THE GOB\'S TWIN ECONOMIC \"STRATEGIES\" OF 
SEEKING NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE AND LIMITING IMPORTS. 
HOWEVER, IT BURDENS AN ALREADY TROUBLED SECTOR AND WILL DO 
LITTLE TO FIX LARGER SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WITH REVENUE 
ENHANCEMENT.  IN LIEU OF CREATING A FUNCTIONING INCOME TAX 
SYSTEM, AUTHORITIES HAVE IN RECENT MONTHS SOUGHT TO RAISE 
MONEY BY IMPOSING HUGE NEW CAR TAXES, SHAKING DOWN LOCAL AND 
FOREIGN BUSINESSES, AND ARE NOW EXPANDING CUSTOMS REVENUE 
WITHOUT RAISING TARIFFS.  SIMILARLY, FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW 
THE GOB HAS TRIED TO CONSERVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND PROMOTE 
IMPORT SUBSTITUTION INDUSTRIES BY STARVING THE ECONOMY OF 
IMPORTS -- THOUGH PREDICTABLY BANNED OR RESTRICTED IMPORTS 
FLOW FREELY OVER THE BORDER FROM THAILAND AND CHINA. 
 
CRANKY CRONIES 
 
5. (C) ACCORDING TO A WELL-CONNECTED BUSINESSMAN, WHEN 
HEARING OF THIS NEW POLICY -- ALLEGEDLY HATCHED BY TRADE 
POLICY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, AND SPDC NUMBER TWO, VICE SENIOR 
GENERAL MAUNG AYE -- THREE OF THE SPDC\'S TOP BUSINESS CRONIES 
APPROACHED PRIME MINISTER GENERAL KHIN NYUNT TO COMPLAIN. 
APPARENTLY THE PM PROMISED TO RAISE THE ISSUE WITH BIG MAN 
SENIOR GENERAL THAN SHWE AT THE NEXT CABINET MEETING, BUT 
WOULD NOT COMMIT TO ANY FAVORABLE RESULT. 
 
COMMENT: BLACK MARKET WILL SAVE THE DAY 
 
6. (C) IT IS HARD TO PREDICT THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY OF 
THIS MOVE.  WITH THE BANKING SYSTEM STILL IN TATTERS, 
BUSINESSPEOPLE WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO COME UP ON SHORT 
NOTICE WITH HUGE QUANTITIES OF KYAT TO PAY OFF THEIR LARGE 
NEW CUSTOMS LIABILITIES.  HOWEVER SO MANY OF BURMA\'S IMPORTS 
(PARTICULARLY CONSUMER GOODS) COME \"DUTY FREE\" VIA BLACK 
MARKET SMUGGLING OR THROUGH WIDESPREAD ABUSE HERE OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL DUTY FREE SYSTEM.  THERE IS ALSO A LONG 
TRADITION OF UNDERINVOICING OF IMPORTS AND THEN SETTLING THE 
DIFFERENCE INFORMALLY VIA THE GLOBAL HONDI REMITTANCE 
NETWORK.  THESE TWO MODALITIES WILL CERTAINLY BECOME MORE 
POPULAR TO EVADE THE NEW COSTS.  HOWEVER, THE POLICY COULD 
HAVE AN INFLATIONARY IMPACT, BUMP UP THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR, 
AND DRAMATICALLY LIMIT THE VOLUME OF SOME CRUCIAL IMPORTED 
INPUTS.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BURMESE USING THAIS TO VIOLATE U.S. IMPORT BAN 
 
REF: 03 RANGOON 1337 
 
1.  SUMMARY: BURMESE GARMENT FACTORY OWNERS ADMITTED TO AN 
EMBASSY OFFICER THAT THEIR COMPANY IS CIRCUMVENTING THE U.S. 
IMPORT BAN ON BURMESE PRODUCTS BY EXPORTING THEIR \"U2\" AND 
\"ADIDAS\" BRAND GARMENTS OVERLAND TO BANGKOK, AND THEN 
RE-EXPORTING THROUGH A THAI COMPANY DIRECTLY TO THE UNITED 
STATES.  THE FACTORY OWNERS SAID THEIR COMPANY WAS INITIALLY 
HURT BY THE JULY 2003 IMPORT BAN, BUT WAS ABLE TO RECOVER BY 
SHIPPING TO THE UNITED STATES USING THIRD COUNTRY 
RE-EXPORTERS.  POST BELIEVES THIS \"RE-EXPORT\" FORMULA IS NOT 
UNUSUAL, WITH TRANSSHIPMENTS BY OTHER COMPANIES POSSIBLY 
BEING MADE THROUGH THAILAND, S. KOREA (REFTEL), AND PERHAPS 
SINGAPORE, HONG KONG, AND TAIWAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  DURING VISA INTERVIEWS AT THE EMBASSY JUNE 10, TWO 
CO-OWNERS OF THE RANGOON-BASED D. FREDERICK INTERNATIONAL 
COMPANY, LIMITED TOLD THE INTERVIEWING CONSULAR OFFICER (WHO 
IS ALSO THE EMBASSY POLOFF) THAT THEY WERE GOING TO THE 
UNITED STATES IN LATE JUNE OR EARLY JULY TO VISIT A NAMED 
U.S. CITIZEN WHO WORKS AT A CULVER CITY, CA IMPORT/EXPORT 
BANK TO SCOUT OUT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR COMPANY. 
ONE OF THE OWNERS, MR ABOO BACKER, SAID HE WAS VERY PROUD OF 
HIS COMPANY\'S QUICK RECOVERY AFTER THE JULY 2003 U.S. IMPORT 
BAN.  HE TOLD POLOFF HOW HIS COMPANY IMPORTS FABRIC FROM 
THAILAND OR CHINA, TURNS IT INTO FINISHED GARMENTS WITH 
EITHER THE \"U2\" OR \"ADIDAS\" LABEL AT HIS 850-PERSON RANGOON 
GARMENT FACTORY, THEN EXPORTS THE GARMENTS OVERLAND THROUGH 
THE BORDER TOWN OF MYAWADDY TO BANGKOK.  THEIR BANGKOK 
PARTNER COMPANY, SAKON M.D. COMPANY, LTD, RE-EXPORTS THE 
GARMENTS DIRECTLY TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A SLIGHT FEE.  MR. 
ABOO BACKER PROUDLY CONFIDED THAT THIS RE-EXPORT ARRANGEMENT 
\"ONLY COSTS A LITTLE MORE.\" 
 
3.  IN HOPES OF STRENGTHENING THEIR VISA CASE, THE TWO 
CO-OWNERS PRODUCED A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE U.S. CONSULAR 
OFFICER IN RANGOON FROM THEIR THAI BUSINESS PARTNERS AT SAKON 
M.D. CO., AND A COPY OF THE THAI COMPANY\'S REGISTRATION. 
INTERESTINGLY, THE LIST OF COMPANY DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS 
INCLUDES NOT ONLY NAMES OF THAIS, BUT ALSO A BURMESE AND A 
CHINESE WITH A TAIWANESE NAME, INDICATING TIES TO OTHER THIRD 
COUNTRIES FOR THE BURMESE COMPANY.  (NOTE: POST IS ENTERING 
THE NAMES OF THE SMD SHAREHOLDERS INTO THE CONSULAR LOOKOUT 
SYSTEM.)  THE TWO APPLICANTS WERE EVENTUALLY DENIED UNDER INA 
214(B), FOR INTENDING TO VIOLATE U.S. IMPORT LAWS. 
 
4.  THE LARGE SCALE OF D. FREDERICK\'S MANUFACTURING 
OPERATIONS IS TYPICAL OF THE DOZENS OF BURMESE GARMENT 
MANUFACTURES WHO MAY ALSO BE RE-EXPORTING TO THE U.S. THROUGH 
THAILAND OR OTHER NEARBY COUNTRIES.  IN A GIVEN MONTH, D. 
FREDERICK BUYS $50,000 WORTH OF COTTON AND POLYESTER FABRIC 
FROM THE ZAINSHAN DONGFENG KNITTING GARMENT CO., IN NINGBO, 
CHINA.  THEN THE 850 FACTORY WORKERS TURN THE FABRIC INTO 
FINISHED GOODS WITH LABOR COSTS OF $34,000 A MONTH.  BURMESE 
CUSTOMS EXPORT DECLARATIONS FROM A TWO-WEEK PERIOD IN JULY 
AND AUGUST 2003 LIST THREE D. FREDERICK CO. SHIPMENTS OF 
MEN\'S SUITS AND COTTON POLO SHIRTS TO A NAMED AMERICAN 
COMPANY IN LOS ANGELES (VIA SINGAPORE) WORTH $100,000. 
THOUGH WE DON\'T KNOW ALL THE TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER 
OVERHEAD COSTS UNDER THE CURRENT RE-EXPORT ARRANGEMENT, THE 
BURMESE CO-OWNER U SAN YU SAID THAT HE MAKES ABOUT $50,000 TO 
$80,000 A MONTH FROM THE BUSINESS. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  THAT THIS COMPANY WAS ABLE TO SHIP OVER 
$100,000 WORTH OF GARMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES DURING THE 
FINAL PRODUCTION SPIKE THE MONTH PRIOR THE AUGUST 2003 IMPORT 
BAN INDICATES THE SCALE OF IMPORT BAN VIOLATIONS COULD BE 
RATHER LARGE.  THE QUESTION REMAINS AS TO HOW MANY OF THE 
OTHER REMAINING GARMENT FACTORIES IN BURMA THAT EXPORTED TO 
THE UNITED STATES BEFORE AUGUST 2003 ARE NOW USING THIS 
\"RE-EXPORT\" FORMULA. 
 
6.  A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE JULY 2003 IMPORT BAN, MANY GARMENT 
FACTORY OWNERS TOLD US THAT EU BUYERS WERE KEEPING THEM IN 
BUSINESS WITH INCREASED ORDERS FOR BURMESE-MADE GARMENTS.  WE 
NOW HAVE SOLID EVIDENCE THAT RE-EXPORTING THROUGH A THIRD 
COUNTRY HELPED AT LEAST ONE BURMESE GARMENT MANUFACTURER 
RECOVER FROM THE IMPORT BAN.  END COMMENT.

     B. RANGOON 223 
     C. 03 RANGOON 1316 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: BURMA\'S FY 2004-05 STATE BUDGET MAGICALLY 
APPEARED IN LATE APRIL, SPORTING FIGURES AND PREDICTIONS FROM 
UNKNOWN SOURCES.  UNSURPRISINGLY, THE MILITARY GETS A BOOST, 
BUT SO DO HEALTH AND EDUCATION.  THE INITIAL TAKE CALLS FOR A 
REDUCED DEFICIT DUE TO INCREASED TAX RECEIPTS AND AN IMPROVED 
STATE-OWNED SECTOR.  HOWEVER, THERE IS NO OBVIOUS 
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS OPTIMISM, SO WE EXPECT LITTLE 
IMPROVEMENT TO THE GOB\'S BOTTOM LINE THIS FISCAL YEAR.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
PICK A NUMBER, ANY NUMBER 
 
2. (SBU) AS IF BY MAGIC, THE GOB MADE APPEAR, IN A MUSTY 
CORNER OF THE APRIL EDITION OF ITS MONTHLY BURMESE LANGUAGE 
GAZETTE, ITS FY 2004-05 (APRIL-MARCH) BUDGET.  THE BUDGET HAS 
NOT BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPER OR FOR WIDE PUBLIC 
DISTRIBUTION SINCE 2001.  THE NUMBERS ARE PURE HYPOTHESIS, 
ESTABLISHED IN AN OPAQUE PROCESS INVOLVING THE VARIOUS 
MINISTRIES AND THE TOP SPDC BRASS.  AS THERE IS NO 
PARLIAMENTARY OR OTHER OVERSIGHT OVER GOVERNMENT SPENDING, 
THE BUDGET FIGURES ARE ALSO MERELY GUIDELINES, AUGMENTED BY 
AN ANNUAL SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET THAT IS ONLY REVEALED 
POST-FACTO AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  IN FY 2003-04, THE 
GOB GRANTED ITSELF A SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET THAT INCREASED 
ADMITTED EXPENDITURES 34 PERCENT AND BALLOONED THE BUDGET 
DEFICIT 382 PERCENT FROM INITIAL ESTIMATES. 
 
3. (SBU) THE BUDGET NUMBERS, EVEN INCLUDING THE SUPPLEMENT, 
ARE OFTEN UNDERSTATED.  MUCH GOVERNMENT SPENDING, 
PARTICULARLY ON THE MILITARY SIDE, OCCURS OFF THE BOOKS. 
LIKEWISE, SIGNIFICANT NON-TAX GOVERNMENT REVENUE IS NOT 
REPORTED BY REGIONAL MILITARY AND CIVIL OFFICIALS WHO PREFER 
TO KEEP IT FOR THEMSELVES RATHER THAN TURN IT IN TO THE 
CENTRAL FUND.  ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT THE BUDGET REPORT DOES 
NOT INDICATE AT WHAT EXCHANGE RATE THE NUMBERS, IN KYAT, ARE 
CALCULATED.  WE ASSUME A 6 KYAT/$ RATE (THE OFFICIAL GOB 
RATE), THOUGH OTHER RATES ARE POSSIBLE FOR CERTAIN REVENUES 
AND EXPENDITURES.  FOR EXAMPLE, UNTIL JUNE 15TH, CUSTOMS 
REVENUE WAS CONVERTED AT THE 100 KYAT/$ RATE (REF A). 
 
4. (SBU) MORE INTERESTING THAN THE QUESTIONABLE FIGURES, 
THEREFORE, ARE THE TRENDS AND BUDGETARY PRIORITIES AND THE 
FORECASTED BUDGET DEFICIT OR SURPLUS.  IN THE PAST, THIS 
LATTER FIGURE HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF INFLATION -- 
SINCE THE GOB ALMOST ALWAYS PRINTS MONEY TO FINANCE ITS 
BUDGET SHORTFALLS. 
 
MAKING SOCIAL SPENDING DISAPPEAR 
 
5. (SBU) OVERALL, THE GOB EXPECTS EXPENDITURES TO DIP 4.3 
PERCENT FROM THE TOTAL FY 2003-04 FIGURE (INCLUDING THE 
SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATION).  THE SINGLE LARGEST LINE ITEM 
IN THE FY 2004-05 BUDGET IS FOR THE DEFENSE MINISTRY, WITH 
NEARLY 10 PERCENT OF THE PROJECTED EXPENDITURES.  DEFENSE\'S 
BUDGET IS UP 54 PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR\'S INITIAL FIGURE AND, 
AS MENTIONED, IS LIKELY FAR BELOW THE ACTUAL AMOUNT SPENT ON 
MILITARY AFFAIRS.  IT IS ALSO LIKELY ONLY A STARTING POINT. 
IN FY 2003-04 THE SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET ADDED A GENEROUS 57 
PERCENT TO THE AMOUNT INITIALLY BUDGETED FOR THE MINISTRY. 
 
6. (SBU) SOCIAL SPENDING DOES NOT FARE AS WELL.  THOUGH THE 
GOB IS EARMARKING NEARLY 6 PERCENT OF THE BUDGET FOR THE 
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH WILL ONLY GET 
1.5 PERCENT OF EXPENDITURES -- THOUGH THIS IS UP 108 PERCENT 
FROM ITS FY 2003-04 INITIAL ALLOTMENT.  THE HEALTH NUMBER IS 
ALSO UNDERSTATED AS SEVERAL OTHER MINISTRIES CONTRIBUTE TO 
THE OVERALL HEALTH SPENDING PICTURE. 
 
7. (SBU) OTHER PRIORITIES FOR 2004-05 ARE: FINANCE AND 
REVENUE (5.5 PERCENT OF THE BUDGET), CONSTRUCTION (4.6 
PERCENT), AND AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION (3.8 PERCENT). 
 
STATE-OWNED FIRMS: FROGS TO PRINCES? 
 
8. (SBU) OPTIMISTICALLY, THE GOB HAS PROJECTED FY 2004-05 
REVENUES TO JUMP 31.5 PERCENT, LED BY AN EXPECTED 73 PERCENT 
INCREASE IN TOTAL TAX RECEIPTS AND 31.5 PERCENT INCREASE IN 
REVENUES FROM DOZENS OF ANTIQUATED STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES 
(SOES).  THE BUDGET ALSO CALLS FOR A 9.5 PERCENT DECLINE IN 
EXPENDITURES FOR THE SOES.  HOWEVER, THESE PROJECTED DECLINES 
OFTEN TURN INTO INCREASES OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR AS THE 
COMPANIES CONTINUE TO HEMORRHAGE MONEY.  IN FY 2003-04 THE 
SOES RECEIVED A 44 PERCENT BONUS IN THE SUPPLEMENTARY 
APPROPRIATION PROCESS.  LIKEWISE WE ARE DUBIOUS THAT THE GOB 
WILL BE ABLE TO MILK ANOTHER 73 PERCENT FROM A ESSENTIALLY 
NON-EXISTENT TAX COLLECTION SYSTEM. 
9. (SBU) THE BUDGET ENVISIONS AN ANNUAL DEFICIT THAT IS 52 
PERCENT DOWN FROM LAST YEAR\'S POST-SUPPLEMENT DEFICIT. 
HOWEVER, THE PROJECTED DEFICIT IS 132 PERCENT LARGER THAN THE 
INITIAL FY 2003-04 PROJECTED DEFICIT.  THE ROSY 2004-05 
PREDICTION IS BASED ON THE HUGE REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS 
MENTIONED ABOVE PLUS A PROJECTED 67 PERCENT DECLINE IN THE 
SOES OVERALL OPERATING DEFICIT -- WHICH MADE UP 58 PERCENT OF 
THE \'03-\'04 TOTAL DEFICIT POST SUPPLEMENT. 
 
10. (SBU) LIKE THE EXPECTED REVENUE INCREASES, IF PAST IS 
PROLOGUE WE THINK THE EXPECTED SOE IMPROVEMENTS ARE ALSO 
WISHFUL THINKING.  IF THE COMPANIES GET THE SAME 44 PERCENT 
BOOST FROM THE FY 2004-05 SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATION THAT 
THEY DID FROM THE FY 2003-04 ONE, THE SOES\' DEFICIT WOULD 
RISE 29 PERCENT COMPARED THE FY 2003-04 DEFICIT. 
 
COMMENT: BUDGETARY PRESTIDIGITATION 
 
11. (SBU) BECAUSE THERE IS NO COMMENTARY PRESENTED ALONG WITH 
THE BUDGET NUMBERS, AND THE FIGURES GIVEN ARE SO FLEXIBLE, IT 
IS HARD TO MAKE FIRM PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BURMA\'S 
DOMESTIC FINANCES.  HOWEVER, WE WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE 
BUDGETARY SITUATION IMPROVED MUCH THIS YEAR.  THERE IS NO 
SIGN THAT THE REGIME INTENDS TO REFORM ITS TAXATION SYSTEM 
AND ITS HALF-HEARTED REVENUE ENHANCEMENT PLANS TO DATE ARE 
EASILY DEFEATED BY THE HUGE UNTAXED INFORMAL ECONOMY 
(REFTELS).  LIKEWISE, WE\'VE SEEN NO EVIDENCE OF ANY 
PRIVATIZATION OR OTHER RATIONALIZATION OF THE STATE-OWNED 
SECTOR THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT IN ITS 
COLLECTIVE BOTTOM LINE.  END COMMENT.

REF: RANGOON 695 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: DCM RONALD K. MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY: AROUND 300 NLD PARTY FAITHFUL ATTENDED A 
CEREMONY AT NLD HEADQUARTERS IN RANGOON TO MARK THE 
NLD-CREATED BURMESE NATIONAL WOMEN\'S DAY AND ASSK\'S 
COINCIDENT 59TH BIRTHDAY, WHILE THE USUAL HEAVY SECURITY 
PRESENCE LOITERED NEARBY.  THE DAY PASSED PEACEFULLY, AND NO 
ARRESTS WERE MADE DESPITE A BALLOON RELEASE AND BLARING 
PRO-ASSK MUSIC ON LOUDSPEAKERS OUTSIDE THE NLD PARTY 
HEADQUARTERS, AND DESPITE A VERY PUBLIC NLD PROCESSIONAL 
MARCH TO THE SHWEDAGON PAGODA AND BACK.  ONLY THE U.S. 
EMBASSY ATTENDED THE BIRTHDAY CEREMONY, AND ONLY THE BRITISH 
EMBASSY JOINED US IN ATTENDING THE PROCESSION AT THE PAGODA. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  DURING THE JUNE 19 CEREMONY AT NLD HEADQUARTERS 
MARKING NATIONAL WOMAN\'S DAY AND ASSK\'S 59TH BIRTHDAY (HER 
EIGHTH ONE IN DETENTION), THE NLD CENTRAL WOMEN\'S COMMITTEE 
DEMANDED ASSK\'S RELEASE, AND CALLED ON BURMESE WOMEN TO BREAK 
THE GLASS CEILING IN THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL 
SECTORS.  NLD SPOKESMAN U LWIN IN HIS RAMBLING SPEECH ALSO 
CALLED FOR ASSK TO BE RELEASED, AND TOLD THE AUDIENCE THE 
MILITARY WON\'T TRANSFER POWER TO ASSK BECAUSE SHE IS A WOMAN. 
 HE CLAIMED THAT THAT ASSK HAS GIVEN THE GIFT OF UNITY TO 
BURMA, THOUGH IRONICALLY ETHNIC NATIONALITIES HADN\'T BEEN 
INVITED AND DID NOT ATTEND THE CEREMONY. 
 
3.  (U) THE RANGOON PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL GAVE 
PERMISSION FOR THE GATHERING, AND THE USUAL HEAVY MI AND 
NATIONAL POLICE PRESENCE ACROSS THE STREET WAS PLAINLY 
EVIDENT.  POLOFF FOLLOWED THE POST-RALLY NLD PROCESSION TO 
THE SHWEDAGON PAGODA, THE LARGEST PAGODA IN THE WORLD, WHERE 
THERE APPEARED TO BE ONE SECURITY OFFICIAL FOR EVERY THREE 
NLD PRESENT.  THERE WERE NO ARRESTS, THOUGH MANY OF THE NLD 
YOUTH, SEVERAL WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED ON MAY 30 AND DETAINED 
FOR SEVERAL DAYS FOR PASSING OUT THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION 
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (REFTEL), WORE THEIR UNIFORM TEE-SHIRTS WITH 
A PICTURE OF GENERAL AUNG SAN ON THE FRONT AND \"FREEDOM FROM 
FEAR\" WRITTEN IN ENGLISH ON THE BACK.  DURING THE 45 MINUTE 
VISIT TO THE SHWEDAGON, PLAINCLOTHES MI, THE UNIFORMED 
NATIONAL POLICE, AND PAGODA SECURITY OFFICERS MADE OBVIOUS 
ATTEMPTS TO BLEND INTO THE CROWD, OUT OF FEAR THAT U.S. AND 
BRITISH DIPLOMATS WOULD FIND THEIR PRESENCE OPPRESSIVE. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT:  THOUGH THIS IS THE EIGHTH TIME ASSK HAS 
SPENT HER BIRTHDAY IN DETENTION, THE NLD FAITHFUL IN 
ATTENDANCE APPEARED FULLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THE QUIET 
FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY.  HOWEVER, THE ADVANCED AGE AND LOW 
ENERGY LEVEL OF THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \"UNCLES\" WERE 
IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE YOUTH AND ACTIVISM OF THE NEW 
GENERATION OF NLD, WHO CONTINUE TO BE KEEN TO TAKE THE 
PRO-DEMOCRACY MESSAGE TO THE STREET.  EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT 
WAS THE DEARTH OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT, MUCH LESS VOCAL SUPPORT, 
FROM THE THOUSANDS OF ONLOOKERS AS THE HUNDREDS OF NLD MADE 
THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CROWDED NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE SHWEDAGON 
ENTRANCE.  FURTHER EVIDENCE OF A NATION COMPLETELY SUBDUED BY 
THE REGIME, EVEN ON THE BIRTHDAY OF GENERAL AUNG SAN\'S 
SO-FAMOUS DAUGHTER.  AND PERHAPS AS NOTEWORTHY, NONE OF THE 
OTHER EU \"FRIENDS\" OF THE NLD SHOWING UP IS EVIDENCE OF 
WANING INTERNATIONAL INTEREST.  END COMMENT.

1. (SBU) ACCORDING TO UNODC\'S BURMA OFFICE, ON JUNE 21ST 
EIGHT AGENCIES OF THE BURMESE GOVERNMENT SAT DOWN WITH THE 
UN, INGO, AND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS FOR 
THE KOKANG AND WA INITIATIVE (KOWI) TO DISCUSS BARRIERS TO 
SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION.  NO DONORS WERE INVITED TO ATTEND. 
 ACCORDING TO UNODC IT WAS THE FIRST TIME ALL PARTNERS WERE 
AT THE TABLE TOGETHER WITH RELEVANT GOB AGENCIES TO DISCUSS 
THE PROGRAM.  IF SUCCESSFUL, KOWI WILL PROVIDE CROP 
SUBSTITUTION AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS WHO FORMERLY 
RELIED ON GROWING OPIUM POPPIES. 
 
2. (SBU) AT THE MEETING, CHAIRED BY THE HOME AFFAIRS 
MINISTRY\'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE FOR DRUG ABUSE CONTROL (CCDAC), 
THE 17 IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS TABLED A LIST OF EIGHT 
OPERATIONAL AREAS IN WHICH IMPROVEMENT WAS NEEDED IN THE WA 
AND KOKANG REGIONS.  UNODC SAID THE PARTNERS WOULD FURTHER 
FLESH THESE ISSUES OUT THEN PRESENT THEM FORMALLY (THOUGH IN 
AN INFORMAL WAY) TO THE GOB FOR FURTHER ACTION.  THE EIGHT 
AREAS ARE: 
 
-- IMPROVED TRANSPORT AND ACCESS INTO THE REGION AND WITHIN 
THE REGION (PARTICULARLY BETWEEN MILITARY REGIONS); 
-- SECURER METHODS TO TRANSFER FUNDS INTO THE REGION; 
-- BETTER ACCESS TO CHINA (FOR PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND FOR 
BANKING OF NEEDED FUNDS); 
-- BETTER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN RANGOON AND THE FIELD AND 
BETWEEN IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS.  THE BEST WOULD BE AN 
INDEPENDENT COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THAT IS NOT RELIANT ON THE 
GOB\'S ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND IS NOT CONTROLLED BY THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES; 
-- BETTER SECURITY, INDEPENDENT OF THE MILITARY OR POLICE 
FORCES WHOSE ACTIVITIES IN THE WA AND KOKANG CEASE-FIRE AREAS 
ARE OFTEN CONSTRAINED, FOR WORKERS IN THE REGION; 
-- ACCESS TO A RELIABLE MEDEVAC SERVICE; 
-- MORE LENIENT IMPORT RESTRICTIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR 
AUTOMOBILES.  WE NOTE THAT THIS IS A BURDEN FOR ALL NGOS, AND 
OTHERS WITHOUT DUTY-FREE PRIVILEGES, OPERATING IN BURMA. 
THOUGH ILLEGALLY IMPORTED CARS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE 
BORDER AREAS, THE GOB ONLY ALLOWS THE CLOSEST BUSINESS 
CRONIES TO LEGALLY IMPORT VEHICLES; AND, 
-- DEVELOPMENT OF A LONG-TERM PLAN BY THE GOB TO ENSURE 
SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROJECT FOLLOWING THE PHASE-OUT OF UN 
INVOLVEMENT. 
 
3. (SBU) COMMENT: CONSIDERING THE VAST NUMBER OF INVOLVED 
PARTIES, CONTINUATION OF THIS TYPE OF ALL-HANDS COORDINATION 
WILL BE VITAL TO MAXIMIZING THE POTENTIAL OF THE KOWI 
PROJECT.  THE CONCERNS THE PARTNERS RAISED ARE EXTREMELY 
VALID, BUT THEY WILL BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO RECTIFY.  EVEN 
IF PARTNERS, OR DONORS, ARE WILLING TO FOOT THE BILL, WE ARE 
DOUBTFUL THE GOB WILL BE ABLE TO (OR WILLING TO IN SOME 
CASES) ADDRESS MANY OF THESE SENSITIVE ISSUES.  END COMMENT.

REF: A. RANGOON 728 
     B. BANGKOK 3954 
 
Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Bangkok-based representatives of Unocal were 
in Burma to introduce a new regional chief.  While paying a 
courtesy call on PM General Khin Nyunt, the Unocal reps heard 
upbeat talk of Burma\'s energy sector and of Burma-Thai 
relations.  The PM also made vague promises of a release of 
ASSK and of NLD participation in the ongoing National 
Convention. We suspect the PM was not giving Unocal the 
straight scoop on these topics, though it\'s always possible 
he\'s seeing matters far differently than we.  End summary. 
 
Gas Development: Pie in the Sky 
 
2. (SBU) Representatives of Unocal paid a courtesy call on 
Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt on June 17th.  The reps, 
based in Bangkok, were in town to introduce a new regional 
manager who will assume responsibilities for Unocal\'s stake 
in an offshore gas project -- Yadana.  According to one of 
the Unocal officials, at the meeting, the PM also raised the 
issue of new natural gas developments off the west coast of 
Burma.  The GOB and the developers of these \"finds,\" Korean 
firms Daewoo and Korea Gas and Indian companies the Oil and 
Natural Gas Commission and the Gas Authority of India, are 
touting enormous reserves of more than 14 trillion cubic feet 
(tcf).  (Note: By comparison, the two gas fields currently 
being exploited by international consortia, and which 
generate around $300 million per year for the GOB, reportedly 
have 9.7 tcf in proven reserves. End note.)  However, other 
energy sector sources have cast doubt on this claim as 
premature at best.  Only two test wells have been drilled, 
the first a dry hole.  More test drilling is ostensibly 
scheduled for this fall. 
 
3. (SBU) The PM told Unocal that the GOB, presumably with 
international assistance, plans to build an LNG plant within 
the next 2-3 years.  Currently the GOB is backing the idea of 
a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, vice a pipeline through 
Bangladesh, as the best method of exporting the gas to India. 
 According to Unocal this plan is still very far fetched 
since the viability of the site has not yet been established, 
let alone at the volume necessary to justify the construction 
of a multibillion dollar plant. 
 
Thaksin: Burma\'s Best Friend 
 
4. (C) The PM then turned to the issue of Burma-Thai 
relations.  Oddly, and contrary to the reports of the RTG 
(ref B), General Khin Nyunt was quite positive, saying that 
bilateral relations were at a high point because of the 
constructive attitude of Thai PM Thaksin. 
 
5. (C) Finally, Unocal reportedly urged the PM to allow all 
parties, including the NLD, into the National Convention (NC) 
and to release all political prisoners.  Khin Nyunt implied 
that GOB was intending to release ASSK but that timing was 
undecided.  He also said there was still a chance for the NLD 
to join the month-old NC -- at variance with comments from 
the Deputy Foreign Minister two weeks back (ref A).  The PM 
also noted the SPDC was still hopeful on reaching a written 
cease-fire with the last remaining major insurgent group, the

Khin Nyunt: Deluded or Lying? 
 
6. (C) Comment: Unocal has always proven to be a useful 
interlocutor, as it has regular and cordial contact with 
senior GOB officials.  From Unocal\'s report of Khin Nyunt\'s 
comments on key economic and political matters, it\'s clear 
that the PM is either: lying, deluded, or thinking wishfully. 
 We suspect the third on the gas reserves, and the first on 
the Thai relationship and the NLD\'s NC participation.  End 
summary.

SUBJECT: THE MADRASSAS OF RANGOON 
 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (S) Summary: Despite pervasive and sometimes aggressive 
religious discrimination that favors Burma\'s Buddhist 
majority, Islamic religious education has survived and 
flourished in Rangoon Division.  Though Rangoon\'s madrassas 
operate under vigilant MI attention, there are up to 130 
schools -- some of which offer full-time boarding programs. 
Rangoon\'s madrassas, and Burma\'s main Islamic groups, rely on 
international assistance for their operation.  However, we\'ve 
no evidence that these institutions are hotbeds of any 
anti-American sentiment or teachings.  End summary. 
 
Islamic Education Flourishes in Rangoon 
 
2. (SBU) According to GOB data, there are 111 madrassas in 
Rangoon Division, with 20 major boarding schools -- which 
take students between the ages of 11 and 24.  Muslim leaders 
in Rangoon say that the total number of madrassas is closer 
to 130, though they agree that there are 20 major 
institutions.  The remaining schools are small 
community-based institutions that teach local youth, boys and 
girls from the age of three, about the Qu\'ran and Islam. 
 
3. (SBU) Though we don\'t know the total number of students in 
Rangoon-area madrassas, one large madrassa principal told us 
the \"Big 20\" have around 1800 total students and the largest 
community-based schools have around 150 students at any one 
time. 
 
4. (SBU) At the larger schools the course of study is from 
four to 10 years, depending on whether the student is 
striving for \"Maulvi\" status or simply the \"Hafiz\" title. 
Particularly bright madrassa students in Rangoon are 
sponsored by local Muslim groups to continue their studies 
abroad -- especially in India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and 
Egypt.  According to one madrassa administrator the most 
popular foreign universities for Rangoon madrassa students 
are the Kassimia Deobandhi University in India, the Mazawahir 
rul Ulum in India, and the Al Azhal University in Egypt.  Of 
course this overseas travel by Muslims is often complicated 
by discriminatory GOB policies that make it difficult for 
members of \"sensitive\" populations to get a passport.  Thus, 
there is a thriving passport brokerage industry (mostly for 
genuine passports acquired with bribes or fake names) in 
Rangoon\'s Muslim community. 
 
5. (SBU) There is surprising freedom in the Rangoon 
madrassas, which may or may not exist in other parts of the 
country.  They are allowed to teach a wide array of basic and 
advanced Qu\'ranic studies, including Qu\'ranic doctrine and 
recitation of the Qu\'ran.  Also, the GOB exempts those 
students attending the boarding madrassas from attending 
regular government school -- a benefit not offered to 
students at tolerated Christian or Hindu religious schools. 
The madrassas offer Arabic, English, and Burmese classes and 
often one or more other language such as Urdu or Farsi.  One 
local madrassa even offers a basic computer course, though 
this is rare because of lack of funds and instructors in 
fields other than language and religious studies. 
 
Foreign Influence Exists Under MI\'s Watchful Eye 
 
6. (C) Despite this fairly positive situation, the madrassas, 
the instructors, the students, and the curriculum fall under 
the ever watchful eye of the Ministry of Religious Affairs 
and the ubiquitous military intelligence (MI).  Through MI 
infiltration and spot checks by other authorities, the GOB 
tries to ensure the madrassa instructors do not stray into 
political or other sensitive matters -- including 
anti-Americanism.  Likewise the authorities try to keep tabs 
on the students at these madrassas by requiring the schools, 
especially the larger boarding schools, to present a daily 
list of overnight students and their activities.  The MI also 
keeps an eye on the comings and goings of the day madrassa 
pupils. 
 
7. (C) This does not always stop outside influence at the 
local madrassas.  Traveling Islamic teachers from Pakistan, 
India, China, and Iran in particular, occasionally appear as 
guest speakers at local mosques and madrassas.  Usually these 
visitors come in on tourist visas and are camouflaged and 
protected by the local community as much as possible from 
prying eyes.  However, we suspect the MI knows about these 
cases and allows them to happen anyway. 
 
8. (S) The madrassas, and the Muslim community in Burma as a 
whole, survives to a large extent on outside funding.  Such 
funding is very difficult to track, as it comes in almost 
always by courier or via Burma\'s vast informal \"hundi\" 
remittance network directly to local individuals or 
organizations.  However, local Muslim groups tell us 
charitable organizations from Saudi Arabia, India, Turkey, 
and Pakistan send money regularly.  One name mentioned was 
the Al Rashid-Muslim Brotherhood Foundation from Karachi. 
(Note: We were unable to determine if this is the same as the 
Al Rashid Foundation on the terrorist finance list.)  Other 
funds are raised from wealthy local Muslim businesspeople. 
 
Comment: Even Activists are Politically Neutral 
 
9. (S) Though the madrassa system is large and active, and 
external funding is widespread, we have no evidence that 
these schools are harboring anti-American elements or 
teaching anti-western doctrine.  Though we believe perhaps 50 
percent of the major madrassas in Rangoon are headed by 
individuals who could be classified as \"fundamentalist,\" fear 
of MI intervention keeps their preaching and teaching from 
being explicitly anti-American or anti-western.  In fact, the 
madrassa system is a bright spot in Burma\'s otherwise dim 
religious freedom picture.  End comment.

SUBJECT: GOB BLAMES EXILE GROUPS FOR JUNE 26 BOMBINGS 
 
REF: RANGOON 676 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: On June 26th, three small bombs exploded and 
four were disarmed at the main Rangoon train station.  The 
GOB blamed exile opposition groups for the incident, just as 
it did for a similar event last July.  We think it more 
likely the GOB did this itself to try to besmirch these 
opposition groups and build legal cases against people who 
have contact with them.  End summary. 
 
No Flowers are Safe 
 
2. (SBU) According to a GOB press conference, early in the 
morning hours of June 26th three small \"mine bombs\" exploded 
in flower pots under a major overpass next to Rangoon\'s 
central train station.  The GOB spokesman said that four 
similar bombs were found and disarmed before they could 
explode and insisted there had been no casualties.  The 
police closed off access to the station on June 26th while 
army engineers purportedly searched the train station for 
further explosive devices.  Several truck-loads of troops in 
combat gear deployed around Rangoon\'s City Hall -- not far 
from the station. 
 
3. (C) According to a police source, military intelligence 
(MI) apparently had prior warning of the bombing, which 
allowed them to \"uncover\" four of the bombs before they 
detonated.  The source also said there may have been minor 
injuries to a couple of bystanders. 
 
Treasonous Minions and External Destructionists to Blame 
 
4. (SBU) The press conference explicitly blamed the 
Bangkok-based Free Trade Unions of Burma (FTUB), and its 
leader U Maung Maung, for the bombing.  Maung Maung is the 
son of NLD Central Executive Committee member U Nyunt Wei. 
The GOB also blasted several well-known exile opposition 
groups -- namely the All Burma Students\' Democratic Front 
(ABSDF), the National League for Democracy-Liberated Areas 
(NLD-LA), the National Coalition Government for the Union of 
Burma (NCGUB), the National Council of the Union of Burma 
(NCUB), and the Democratic Party for New Society -- for their 
participation in the alleged plot. 
 
5. (SBU) The GOB made a clear linkage between the alleged 
attack of June 26th and a similar \"plot\" uncovered in July 
2003.  This latter case led to the arrest and death sentence 
for twelve individuals, including three who it was later 
discovered were convicted largely based on evidence of ties 
to the ILO and the aforementioned FTUB (reftels).  The GOB 
press conference even mentioned two of these people, U Shwe 
Mann and U Min Kyi, and their FTUB ties in the context of the 
recent bombings. 
 
6. (C) The naming of the FTUB, and U Maung Maung, as the 
chief instigator of this latest \"terrorist\" incident is 
clearly an effort to further stress the \"treacherous\" aspects 
of the group and those who have contact with it -- such as 
the three arrested in 2003.  (Note: a Supreme Court panel in 
May ruled that the FTUB was a treasonous organization.)  It 
is also part of a recent crackdown on those who\'ve had 
contact with exile opposition groups.  In early June two NLD 
organizers, U Tin Myint and Ma Than Than, were arrested for 
having contact with the NLD-LA (also an outlawed 
organization). 
 
Heading for the Border? 
 
7. (C) It is not exactly clear why the GOB is feeling 
particularly threatened by the exile groups these days.  One 
theory is that many former political prisoners and other 
opposition figures are contacting these groups in preparation 
for fleeing across the border to Thailand.  This theory may 
have credulity.  Opposition sources told us that U Tin Myint 
and Ma Than Than were in touch with the NLD-LA regarding 
their escape from Burma.  Many other NLD youth have 
reportedly done the same.  Our Public Diplomacy section 
reports that many former political prisoners who have been 
taking classes at the American Center have come by recently 
to say \"good-bye\" before heading for Thailand. 
Comment: For Show 
 
8. (C) We are pretty confident that this latest incident is 
yet another chapter in the GOB\'s regular, and pathetically 
unsuccessful, effort to discredit insurgent or exile 
opposition groups by linking them to vague attacks on the 
\"Union\" or, in the most recent case, \"the success of the 
National Convention.\"  Thankfully the bombs planted were not 
large enough to cause any damage or any (serious) injuries. 
More alarming is the fact that the GOB seems to be circling 
its wagons to defend against international criticism of the 
arrest and sentencing of people for contacts with groups 
deemed critical of the regime.  This regressive behavior does 
not bode well for future ILO cooperation or for any 
liberalization of the political situation.  End comment.

SUBJECT: THE MANDALAY NLD: ON THE DEFENSIVE 
 
REF: RANGOON 612 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen M. Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: The regime has recently increased its efforts 
to suppress the actions of the NLD in Mandalay through 
intrusive and intimidating surveillance of senior NLD 
members. Despite the regime\'s efforts, the NLD maintains a 
positive spirit while it continues to hold out hope for UN 
intervention.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE REGIME\'S HUNGRY EYES: SURVEILLANCE THAT WON\'T SUBSIDE 
 
2. (C) In an office adorned with the usual ASSK 
paraphernalia, NLD Mandalay members initially informed Poloff 
that after the NLD decided not to participate in the National 
Convention, there had not been any significant increase of 
\"intimidation, interference or disturbance\" on the part of 
the regime with respect to the NLD\'s activities. However, 
senior members then reported that they work under the 
ever-watchful (and increasingly intrusive) eyes of the 
Special Branch of police (SB), whose presence, intentionally 
or unintentionally, is all but discreet. The NLD believes 
that the regime is using the very obvious surveillance 
presence to send a strong message to the public that the 
security apparatus is in full control -- not the people\'s 
elected representatives and their democracy party. 
 
3. (C) According to our NLD interlocutors, the regime has 
also opened up an economic offensive, targeting NLD members\' 
businesses and threatening their workers.  The children of 
the NLD upper tier are often not allowed to attend 
post-secondary school or join the civil service, and every 
year, members are arrested on the anniversary of the NLD\'s 
founding and the anniversary of the NLD\'s overwhelming 
victory in the last election in 1990.  Torture and cruelty 
during interrogations are not uncommon for the NLD political 
prisoners, some of whom are MP-elects. Several members showed 
us the serious injuries they suffered at the hands of the 
government while in custody following the May 30, 2003 
attacks at Depayin.  Whenever incarcerated, they are treated 
as \"petty criminals,\" and such treatment \"degrades their 
integrity.\" 
 
4. (C) On another front, according to our NLD contacts, the 
USDA (the regime\'s mass membership organization) is forcing 
USDA membership on whole village populations across Mandalay 
Division using pre-prepared membership forms, intimidation, 
and deception.  The USDA is now claiming 100% membership in 
some areas. The NLD also reports that the USDA submits 
inaccurate information to the higher echelons of government, 
ridiculously exaggerating the scope of the NLD\'s \"subversive\" 
activities, which allows the USDA to use more repressive and 
intrusive tactics in stifling the NLD. 
 
5. (SBU) As has become ritual, the NLD leaders told us they 
seek a UN resolution to enforce the election results 
nullified by the SLORC/SPDC and requests the United States to 
pressure the UN and ASEAN towards this end. 
 
COMMENT: OLD FAITHFUL 
 
6. (C) The NLD delegation in Mandalay demonstrates a high 
level of risk-tolerance and patience, given the viciously 
oppressive nature of the ruling junta. They continue to 
maintain their conviction that U.S. policy will bring about 
the change they seek in the GOB.

1. (C) Summary: UN Special Envoy Razali\'s \"Man in Rangoon\" 
painted a gloomy picture of the current state of the NLD. 
While the party and its executive board remain in stasis, 
awaiting the release of General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi, 
the GOB steams ahead along its bogus democracy \"Road Map.\" 
Though NLD leaders are finally getting the message that 
international pressure alone will not achieve domestic 
political change, some of the party\'s youngest and most 
motivated members are already fleeing in frustration for the 
Thai border.  End summary. 
 
\"We are Completely Stuck\" 
 
2. (C) In a July 7th meeting with the Chief of Mission (COM), 
Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) confidant and UN Special Envoy 
Razali\'s \"Man in Rangoon\" Leon de Riedmatten (LDR) painted a 
notably gloomy picture of the state of the NLD.  While the 
GOB\'s self-described \"Road Map to Democracy\" and 
constitutional National Convention steam ahead (ref B) he 
said he was frustrated that local stakeholders, namely the 
NLD Central Executive Committee (CEC) and ASSK (still under 
house arrest), had been unwilling to express an opinion or 
propose a strategy for taking things in another direction. 
\"We are completely stuck,\" he lamented. 
 
3. (C) LDR noted that the NLD apparatus remained in a 
dangerous \"wait and see\" mode, with the CEC apparently 
awaiting the release of party General Secretary ASSK before 
devising any policy alternatives.  He said that although 
clandestine channels of communication that the NLD has been 
using remain in place, for the last several months he\'d heard 
nothing from ASSK and had gotten very little sign of 
intellectual life from the mostly octogenarian members of the 
CEC. 
 
Too Much Reliance on the International Community 
 
4. (C) LDR revealed that he had distributed to ASSK, the CEC 
members, and other opposition political organizations a copy 
of a UN-drafted paper on \"what the UN could and could not do\" 
for Burma.  The purpose was to stress that complete reliance 
on the international community, and particularly a UN \"silver 
bullet,\" to bring about change was unproductive.  He pointed 
out to the opposition politicians that \"only 40 countries had 
sponsored the General Assembly resolution on Burma, with 150 
abstaining.\"  He did suggest to the CEC, though, that if they 
wanted to raise the Burma situation with the UN Security 
Council they should send a letter directly to the UNSC chair 
asking for consideration. 
 
5. (C) The message has apparently gotten through, said LDR. 
The CEC members had not raised a UNSC resolution with him, 
always a staple of conversations with the NLD, during their 
last few meetings together. 
 
Comment: Time Slipping Away 
 
6. (C) LDR stressed that the release of ASSK was key, as only 
she could organize and motivate the party to take action. 
However, the regime knows this as well, and thus will be 
unlikely to release her so long as it continues its 
\"progress\" along the Road Map and continues to reap 
international support -- or at least avoid public criticism 
as it did at the recent ARF meetings in Jakarta.  Meanwhile, 
the party is being hollowed out.  We\'ve noted with some alarm 
many NLD youth, who seem the most eager and motivated of the 
NLD\'s entire structure, heading for the Thai border (ref A). 
This mini-exodus is likely out of a sense of frustration with 
the regime\'s oppression and obstinacy but also, perhaps, with 
their own party\'s inability to take action or even 
communicate a clear policy.  End comment.

 1.  (C) Summary: A visit to Senior General Than Shwe\'s 
hometown of Kyaukse revealed a town of above average 
development, but with lingering religious tensions.  After 
Buddhist-Muslim religious riots here in October 2003, there 
seems to have been little attempt by anyone to systematically 
eliminate the root causes.  Neither, however, do the tensions 
seem to have affected people\'s daily life  -- focused like 
most other Burmese lives on subsistence.  End summary. 
 
In Search of Peace and Development? Try Kyaukse. 
 
2.  (U) Embassy Officers visited Senior General Than Shwe\'s 
hometown of Kyaukse in central Burma on June 28 and found 
tidy, leafy streets with neat houses radiating out from a 
small, yet bustling town center. The ten burned out 
Muslim-owned four-story buildings, in various stages of 
reconstruction, around the town\'s center square are a 
reminder of the religious riots that occurred here last 
October.  Beside this, though, there were none of the usual 
signs of government neglect so evident in other towns and 
villages in Burma -- a fringe benefit of being a senior 
general\'s hometown (ref A).  Kyaukse is located in Mandalay 
Division, an hour\'s drive south of Mandalay city along a 
well-engineered four-lane divided highway with 
concrete-reinforced bridges over most of the major creeks. 
 
Kyaukse USDA Leaves Us at the Altar 
 
3.  (C) The Secretary of the Kyaukse District Union 
Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), the GOB\'s mass 
member organization, evidently had obligations at the 
National Convention in Rangoon and was unavailable to meet 
with us.  Instead, Poloff attempted to meet with 
township-level USDA officials.  However, they never showed up 
at the district offices as promised, and finally the head of 
the USDA local office said that without the permission from a 
\"higher authority the USDA cannot meet any foreign guest.\" 
 
Legacy Remains of Religious Violence 
 
4.  (C) Poloff visited the residence of a Muslim family to 
ask about the inter-communal riots in October 2003 (ref C) 
and was told the family was forced to flee for their lives 
when Buddhist mobs attacked Muslim shops and homes in the 
middle of the town. The arrival of intelligence agents ended 
our dialogue with the family, but they added that nine 
Muslims burned to death in their homes that day.  Muslim 
leaders in Rangoon had previously given us accounts of the 
violence and the GOB\'s response (refs B and C). 
 
5.  (C) To get the other side of the story, Poloff visited 
the Kyaukthinbaw monastery on Kyaukse hill, which currently 
houses 30 monks.  Poloff met with monks who informed him that 
the Abbot of the monastery, Ven. Wisuda (73) and his young 
driver were killed by a Muslim mob from Letpan village, four 
miles away from Kyaukse, on their way to a Buddhist \"robe 
offering ceremony\" in his native village.  Their bodies were 
dumped into Zawgyi Creek.  This event re-ignited \"dormant\" 
tensions between the Buddhist and Muslim communities, and 
culminated with riots in Kyaukse on October 22. 
 
6.  (C) Kyaukse\'s finest scoured Letpan for four days in 
search of the culprits responsible for the Abbot\'s murder. 
The monks informed Poloff that authorities told them 26 
Muslims were arrested and put on trial at the Mandalay 
Divisional Court.  Of these, 20 were sentenced to death, five 
were given long prison terms, and one minor was given seven 
years imprisonment. Though these numbers differ slightly from 
our previous understanding (ref B), local Muslim sources 
verified these monks\' figures.  (Note: though not mentioned 
in Kyaukse, the GOB also took stern legal and administrative 
measures against Buddhist monks in Rangoon for their part in 
subsequent religious violence in the capital.) 
7.  (C) Notably, the monks stated their belief that tensions 
between the two religious groups was what sparked the 
religious violence.  Hence, they are eager to engage in 
inter-faith dialogue to mitigate the situation.  This account 
contradicts statements by Rangoon Muslim leaders who were 
quick to blame GOB provocateurs, not latent religious 
tension, for the riots (ref B). 
 
Comment: Not in His Backyard 
 
8.  (C) Though there has been no decisive resolution to last 
year\'s religious riots, tensions seem to have dissipated and 
they do not seemed to have caused a change in the behavior of 
Kyaukse\'s ordinary citizens.  The harsh punishments doled out 
by the regime in response to last October\'s events hammer 
home its conviction that there is no room in Burma for 
\"instability,\" religiously inspired or not, especially in The 
Big Boss\' hometown.  End Comment.

says that while the SPDC gives \"regular\" consideration to 
releasing ASSK, the GOB will not repeat a 1995 \"mistake\" of 
freeing the NLD leader that led to the collapse of the 
National Convention.  The Minister, while cordial, criticized 
our recent TIP report on Burma, dismissed concerns over 
forced labor, cited unspecified progress in fighting 
corruption, and underscored GOB expectations that the UWSA 
will cease poppy cultivation in 2005.  The COM urged greater 
dialogue on TIP issues, called for an unambiguous statement 
on the free association of Burmese citizens with the ILO, and 
pressed for the release of ASSK and U Tin Oo.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On July 9 COM and P/E chief called on the Minister for 
Home Affairs, Colonel Tin Hlaing, and exchanged views on a 
variety of human and drug trafficking issues as well as 
Burma\'s National Convention.  On June 16 COM had provided 
several relevant GOB and SPDC officials with copies of the 
annual TIP report and requested an opportunity to discuss 
trafficking issues.  To date, Tin Hlaing is the only senior 
official to respond to our request. 
 
TIP: Tears at Tier 3 
-------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Col Tin Hlaing said he was \"greatly discouraged\" to 
read the TIP report on Burma, complaining that the 
conclusions were biased and that the global report had placed 
too much emphasis on countries of origin.  He lamented that 
Burma remained a Tier 3 country while numerous countries with 
inferior plans of action and legislative efforts had earned 
Tier 2 rankings. 
 
4. (C) Tin Hlaing said that the GOB had prepared, with PM 
Khin Nyunt\'s blessing, a new law on human trafficking. 
However, UN agencies had advised the GOB not to issue the new 
legislation before allowing experts to review and comment. 
Tin Hlaing said that the GOB had \"hastily\" issued money 
laundering legislation last year and was now facing \"hiccups\" 
with FATF and the international community.  Therefore, 
according to the Minister, the GOB plans to \"go slow\" on the 
trafficking legislation, but will have the new law in place 
by October when Burma hosts a regional \"Inter-Ministerial, 
Inter-Country Consultation on Human Trafficking.\" 
 
5. (SBU) The COM observed that while the GOB had improved 
cooperation with UN agencies and NGOs, Burma\'s Tier 3 
designation was primarily a result of forced labor practices. 
 The COM also noted that although the GOB had issued a 
comprehensive statement on June 26 detailing trafficking 
convictions and sentences, this information was provided too 
late for the TIP report--more than a week after publication 
of the report and months after initial Embassy requests for 
updates on TIP-related actions.  \"You can\'t give us too much 
information,\" the COM said, urging Tin Hlaing to strive for 
greater dialogue with the USG on trafficking issues. 
 
Clarify the ILO Issue 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) Minister Tin Hlaing alleged that the practice of 
forced labor had declined considerably in Burma in the 
absence of major military offensives against ethnic insurgent 
groups.  He claimed that the Burmese Army (BA) is training 
battalions to use pack animals instead of humans and the BA 
is also constructing roads to remote border areas, thereby 
reducing the need for forced portering.  He also said that 
the GOB held a weekly meeting at the Ministry of Defense to 
review child soldier issues and had recently invited UNICEF 
to visit and inspect army recruitment centers. 
 
7. (C) The COM observed that the GOB\'s poor human rights and 
labor practices had delayed implementation of the ILO\'s Plan 
of Action.  She raised the recent case of three individuals 
convicted of treason for having contact with the ILO and 
urged the GOB to issue a statement clarifying that 
association with the ILO is not a punishable act.  Tin Hlaing 
claimed that the judge in the ILO case had made an \"error,\" 
but that the courts had subsequently reduced the sentences 
and excluded mention of the ILO.  The COM pressed back and 
said that reducing the death sentences did not address the 
larger problem that contact by Burmese citizens with the ILO 
was understood to be a criminal offense.  \"You must clarify 
this issue with an unambiguous public statement,\" urged the 
COM. 
 
Drugs: Shortcomings and Goings 
------------------------------ 
 
8. (SBU) The COM raised a recent GOB announcement regarding 
supervision of controlled precursor chemicals.  Minister Tin 
Hlaing said that a law on precursor chemicals is already in 
place, but explained that his Ministry had recently issued 
related guidelines to improve implementation.  He said that, 
given recent success in reducing poppy cultivation and opium 
production, the GOB now placed greater emphasis on stimulants 
(ATS) and precursor chemicals. 
 
9. (C) The COM asked Tin Hlaing about the GOB\'s reaction 
should the United Wa State Army (UWSA) not adhere to its 
deadline to cease poppy cultivation in 2005.  The Minister 
grew defensive and declared that the Wa would keep their word 
and the GOB fully expected cultivation to end by September 
2005.  He said the GOB\'s most significant concern was that 
drug syndicates would continue to operate along the border 
area, with a greater focus on ATS.  In this regard, Burma 
hoped to achieve improved cooperation with China and Thailand 
on counter-ATS activities. 
 
10. (C) We noted to Tin Hlaing that Burma has made gains in 
reducing poppy cultivation and establishing drug-related laws 
and regulations, adding that we hoped to repeat a successful 
joint opium yield survey again in 2005.  However, we told the 
Minister, the GOB needed to address significant shortcomings 
in combating corruption and enforcing existing 
narcotics-related legislation--including taking action 
against drug kingpins such as Wei Hsueh Kang.  Tin Hlaing 
claimed, but did not offer details, that the GOB had taken 
\"serious action\" against corruption, including the recent 
arrest of Bao Yu Yi, the notorious younger brother of UWSA 
leader Bao Yu Chen (Note: To our knowledge, the GOB played no 
role in the arrest.  End note).  Tin Hlaing also claimed that 
the GOB could do nothing about Wei Hsueh Kang \"because he is 
no longer in the country.\" 
 
National Conventioneers Take a Break 
------------------------------------ 
 
11. (C) Tin Hlaing said that the National Convention had 
adjourned on July 9 because \"delegates need a break after two 
months of exchanging views,\" but would reconvene in October 
or November.  COM asked if there was a possibility for the 
NLD to participate when the NC reconvened and Tin Hlaing 
replied, \"we would consider such a request, because we don\'t 
want them entirely out of the process.\" 
 
12. (C) COM pressed for the release of NLD leaders ASSK and U 
Tin Oo, observing that Tin Hlaing has previously told her, 
the COM, that he \"doesn\'t like putting Burmese people into 
jail.\"  The Minister replied that the SPDC gives serious 
consideration to releasing the two NLD leaders and regularly 
discusses international community views on this issue. 
However, he added, \"we must consider internal implications 
(of their release).  We will not repeat our mistake (of 1995) 
when we released ASSK and delegates subsequently withdrew 
from the National Convention (leading to the collapse of the 
Convention).\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
13. (C)  We are hopeful that Tin Hlaing\'s response to our 
request for a discussion on TIP issues may lead to a more 
regular dialogue at senior GOB levels on human and drug 
trafficking.  Nonetheless, the paltry efforts to rectify 
problems associated with the ILO cases, as well as the tardy 
June 26 clarification provided on TIP actions, give us every 
indication that the GOB\'s modus operandi will continue to be 
\"too little, too late\" on many of these issues. 
 
14. (C) Tin Hlaing played a key role in negotiations with 
ASSK leading up to the reconvening of the National Convention 
in May and has first-hand knowledge of the various 
compromises that the NLD was willing to make in order to join 
the Convention process.  However, he also knows that SPDC 
Chairman Than Shwe nixed an arrangement leading to ASSK\'s 
release.  Tin Hlaing\'s observations that the SPDC will not 
repeat the 1995 \"mistake\" underscores that the regime likely 
intends to keep ASSK and U Tin Oo under house arrest for the 
foreseeable future.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: The constitutional National Convention (NC) 
\"adjourned\" (as the state press put it) on July 9th, ending 
an eight week session that has gone largely according to the 
SPDC\'s script.  The NC will allegedly reconvene in the late 
Fall to continue its \"deliberations.\"  We see no reason why 
the NLD will be included in this next session, as it was 
excluded without repercussions during phase one.  Likewise, 
we see little chance that the ethnic cease-fire groups will 
jeopardize their economic status quo by taking a significant 
stand opposing the regime\'s pre-scripted constitutional 
process.  End summary. 
 
National Convention: That\'s A Wrap 
 
2. (SBU) The National Constitutional Convention (NC) 
adjourned for a recess on July 9th following an eight week 
run at a site 20 miles north of Rangoon.  The NC, which is 
step one of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt\'s seven-step \"Road Map 
to Democracy,\" brought together around 1,000 delegates, 
divided into nine groups, but did not include the National 
League for Democracy (NLD) or any of the ethnically-based 
opposition parties.  The state-controlled \"New Light of 
Myanmar\" newspaper had extensive coverage of the NC and the 
\"adjournment,\" including a spread on July 12th showing SPDC 
Secretary Two Lt. Gen. Thein Sein seeing off the delegates at 
 
SIPDIS 
3:45 am. 
 
3. (SBU) This first eight weeks of the NC dealt with the 
guidelines for drafting the legislative aspects of the new 
constitution, though there was little evidence of any genuine 
debate.  Guidelines for drafting the judicial and executive 
portions of the constitution await the next session of the 
NC.  There was no word on when, or if, the role of the 
military in the new constitution would be discussed. 
According to Secretary Two, and Chairman of the National 
Convention Convening Committee (NCCC), the NC will reconvene 
when the rice harvest is in and the weather is \"fine and 
pleasant.\"  By anyone\'s count, this means no sooner than 
November. 
 
4. (SBU) During the recess, the NC Working Committee 
officials (all good party men) will draft the final 
guidelines for the legislative portion of the constitution. 
Ostensibly they will take into consideration the proposals 
submitted by the nine groups of delegates.  However, thus 
far, the SPDC and its NC puppets have shown little interest 
in allowing any outside input at all on substantive matters 
already covered in the regime\'s \"104 principles\" left over 
from the NC\'s last session, which collapsed in 1996. 
 
Comment: All Aboard! 
 
5. (C) The National Convention, and by extension the whole 
\"Road Map,\" have turned out to be a complete railroading. 
The SPDC has completed the first phase smoothly with no 
substantive debate and without NLD interference.  The 
delegate group of \"specially invited\" ethnic cease-fire 
groups (CFGs) was the only group of the nine who had anything 
new to say during the eight-week NC session (ref B), but the 
CFGs appear to have struck out thus far in their efforts to 
squeeze more states\' rights out of the pre-cooked guidelines. 
 We are now waiting to see if the CFGs make good on their 
previous, frustrated threats (to us, not to the GOB) to 
refuse to return to the NC when it is next convened (ref B). 
We are skeptical, though, as the CFGs hold very few cards and 
may be reluctant to jeopardize their current economically 
beneficial arrangements with the SPDC over political issues 
the CFGs understand poorly.  End comment.

SUBJECT: Western China Woos Burma Trade 
 
REF: Chengdu 305 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  The largest-ever business delegation to 
travel to Burma from Southwest China\'s Sichuan province 
visited Rangoon in late June for a Chinese-export trade 
fair.  Ironically, many Chinese goods exhibited at the fair 
are on Burma\'s list of items restricted or banned for 
import.  Burmese businessmen share a desire to increase 
bilateral trade, and have traveled to Sichuan to drum up 
interest in Burma\'s raw materials and other exports. 
Reported trade between Burma and Sichuan/Chongqing is one- 
sided: exports from Sichuan and Chongqing to Burma totaled 
over USD 100 million in 2003, while imports from Burma to 
Chongqing were under USD 400,000 and imports to Sichuan 
totaled zero.  The fair was part of a broader effort by 
local governments in Southwest China to promote trade with 
Southeast Asian nations and of the GOB to showcase its 
increasingly close ties to China.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) This cable is a joint report by Embassy Rangoon and 
Consulate General Chengdu. 
 
Motorbikes, Pesticides, and Other Delights 
----------------------------------------- 
3. (U) The largest-ever business delegation to travel to 
Burma from Southwest China\'s Sichuan province attended a 
trade fair organized in Rangoon June 29-July 1 by the 
Sichuan and Chongqing offices of the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).  Embassy Rangoon 
EconOff visited the fair, which featured 43 Chinese 
exhibitors displaying an array of motorcycles, generators, 
light agricultural machinery, pesticides, traditional 
medicines, consumer goods, and foodstuffs.  CCPIT officials 
in Sichuan told ConGen Chengdu that they were emphasizing 
exports to Burma of agricultural products, medicine, and 
\"infrastructure projects,\" which include equipment and 
engineering services. 
 
High-Level Connections 
---------------------- 
4. (SBU) According to Sichuan trade promotion officials, the 
Burmese government gave high-level attention to the event. 
Five Burmese ministers attended the exhibit and each had one- 
on-one meetings with Chinese companies.  The impetus for 
organizing the trade fair reportedly came from the new 
Commercial Officer at the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon, Mr. 
Tang Hai, who previously served as Vice-Director of 
Sichuan\'s Commerce Bureau (formerly known as the Foreign 
Trade Bureau).  Tang may be hoping to use his new position 
to help out old friends back in Sichuan. 
 
Just \"Window Shopping\" 
---------------------- 
5. (SBU) Ironically, the vast majority of Chinese goods 
exhibited at the trade fair (such as vehicles and all 
consumer goods) are on Burma\'s list of items restricted or 
banned for import for protectionist or foreign exchange 
conservation reasons.  In addition, few of the Chinese 
attendees spoke English or Burmese, and those that did 
admitted that they had not made any deals -- nor did they 
expect to -- and that they had not been given permission by 
the GOB to import any more of their products than they could 
display.  Despite heavy promotion in Burma\'s state- 
controlled media, Rangoon EconOff observed that the fair was 
poorly attended by local businessmen and the only booths 
drawing attention were those giving away freebies. 
 
Legal or Underground Market? 
---------------------------- 
6. (SBU) One ethnic Chinese businessman told Rangoon EconOff 
before the fair that he recently led a group of top Burmese 
executives on a promotional tour of Sichuan province trying 
to drum up demand for Burmese raw materials and other export 
goods.  A parallel goal of the trip was to seek suppliers 
for Burma\'s vast import needs.  The businessman spoke 
encouragingly of expanding future ties between Burma and 
Sichuan, saying that to date most trade ties with China have 
been with Yunnan province, which shares a long border with 
Northern Burma.  He was not clear, though, on whether new 
trade ties with inland areas such as Sichuan and Chongqing 
would be conducted through official channels (\"white\") or by 
smugglers (\"black\"). 
 
7. (U) There are signs that Sichuan-based companies are 
already seizing better business opportunities in Burma. 
According to sources in Rangoon, Sichuan Machinery Import 
and Export Company has inked a deal with Myanmar Electric 
Power Enterprise to provide electric transmission 
infrastructure -- probably using a massive supplier\'s credit 
China granted to Burma over the past few years -- for a new 
hydropower project under construction along the Burma-China 
border. 
 
One-Sided Trade 
--------------- 
8. (U) Official Chinese government statistics indicate that 
trade between Burma and Sichuan/Chongqing is extremely one- 
sided.  China recorded no imports from Burma to Sichuan in 
2003, and in 2002 imports from Burma totaled only USD 
40,000.  Similarly, Chongqing authorities reported importing 
nothing from Burma in 2002, and only USD 380,000 worth of 
goods in 2003, mostly minerals and other raw materials. 
Chongqing\'s exports to Burma spiked in 2003, surpassing USD 
95 million, as the city increased the number of motorcycles 
it shipped to Burma - despite official GOB restrictions on 
such imports.  This was nearly double the almost USD 50 
million in exports Chongqing sent to Burma in 2002. 
Sichuan\'s exports to Burma fell in 2003, dropping to USD 
13.4 million compared to USD 21.2 million in 2002. 
 
9. (U) China\'s trade figures show that about one-third of 
China\'s total reported commerce with Burma is conducted 
through Yunnan province (Ref A), which borders Burma, Laos 
and Vietnam.  Sichuan province is located north of Yunnan, 
and does not border any foreign country.  Reported exports 
from Yunnan to Burma rose 20.6 percent in 2003 and another 
40 percent in the first four months of 2004, while imports 
rose 27.2 percent and 20.4 percent in the same time periods. 
These figures likely do not take into account significant 
smuggling activity in both directions.  From Burma come 
gems, illegal narcotics, and teak; from China come a wide 
array of consumer goods and vehicles. 
 
Comment 
------- 
10. (SBU) Officials in Southwest China are under pressure to 
maintain high rates of GDP growth and have thus adopted 
export promotion strategies that include aggressively 
reaching out to Southeast Asian nations.  Chinese contacts 
have told ConGen Chengdu that the recent Sichuan/Chongqing 
trade fair in Rangoon was an effort to build on Chongqing\'s 
recent success in selling motorcycles to Burma, though we 
doubt that it will do much to expand legal exports.  The 
personal connection between the Chinese Embassy\'s new 
Commercial Officer and Sichuan foreign trade officials was 
another important factor.  More broadly, Southwest China has 
a clear interest in promoting exports to Southeast Asian 
markets as well as in acquiring more raw materials for use 
by its manufacturers.  The GOB is always keen to use trade 
fairs to showcase its increasingly close ties with the PRC 
as a counterweight to deteriorating relations with the 
United States and Europe.  However, it appears to see such 
trade fairs as nothing more than a PR opportunity. End 
comment.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: GOB claims of significant releases of 
political prisoners in 2004 are a bit misleading.  While many 
have been freed this year, most are those who have been 
picked up and then quickly released without charge, or those 
who were arrested following last May\'s attack on ASSK\'s 
convoy but never charged.  Aside from these \"revolving door\" 
releases, and despite continued international pressure, only 
13 of the 1,300 long-term political prisoners in Burma have 
been freed this year -- a pace far slower than 2003\'s release 
rate.  End summary. 
 
Some Real Releases, Most are \"Revolving Door\" 
 
2. (C) According to opposition sources, the GOB recently 
released three long-term political prisoners before 
completion of their sentences.  The three, U Thar Ban, Dr. 
Maung Maung Kyaw, and Ma Su, were sentenced to seven years 
imprisonment in 1998 for assisting in the compilation of a 
seven-volume history of the Burmese student movement. 
Student groups in Burma, especially the Rangoon University 
student union, have always been a font of anti-government 
activity.  A fourth person, U Min Thu, also sentenced for 
this \"crime\" died in prison on June 12 after a long illness. 
 
3. (SBU) So far in 2004 there has been a relatively steady 
trickle of press reports or GOB press statements trumpeting 
releases of political prisoners.  Of the 24 pro-democracy 
activists arrested so far this year for handing out pamphlets 
or other such offenses, 22 have been released.  Only U Tin 
Myint (an NLD lawyer) and Ma Than Than Htay (an NLD 
organizer) have not been released and are likely to end up 
with long prison sentences for their alleged contacts with 
the Federation of Trade Unions of Burma (FTUB), an exile 
group in Thailand that has been branded a terrorist 
organization by the regime (ref A).  The GOB also released 
around 50 NLD political prisoners who were arrested, but 
never charged, following the GOB ambush of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s 
(ASSK) convoy near Depeyin on May 30, 2003.  These 50 were 
not part of the \"official\" NLD and UN list of 153 arrested at 
Depeyin -- all of whom have been subsequently released save 
ASSK and NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo (ref B). 
 
4. (C) The GOB is trying to take credit for releasing 
political prisoners by counting \"revolving door\" releases of 
those picked up recently but not charged, and those held 
without charge following a post-May 30 sweep.  Looking only 
at long-term, non-Depeyin, prisoners, our count shows the GOB 
can only take credit so far this year for 13 releases.  Most 
of those released had either served out their sentences or 
were very close to finishing them.  In addition to U Thar 
Ban, Dr. Maung Maung Kyaw, and Ma Su, long-term political 
prisoners released to date in 2004 were: 
 
- Myint Naing: sentenced to 25 years in 1991, later reduced 
to ten years.  He served the full ten years. 
- Tin Tun: a champion boxer sentenced in 1993 to 20 years. 
- Soe Tun: a Rangoon Technical Institute student arrested 
1996. 
- Tin Aye: a lawyer sentenced in 1998 to seven years 
- Wa-ben Soe: ill with cancer. 
- Khin Cho Myint: served 10 years. 
- Kyaw Kyaw: arrested 1999. 
- Ne Oo Maung Maung: arrested 1999. 
- Min Min Soe: arrested 1999. 
- Myint Oo: arrested 1999. 
 
Comment: A Slow Pace 
 
5. (C) Despite its propaganda, and defiant of continuous USG 
and UN pressure to release political prisoners, the GOB has 
freed only 13 of the more than 1,300 long-term political 
prisoners in 2004.  This pace is far slower than 2003, when 
the GOB released more than 100 long-term political prisoners. 
 It is reflective of the regime\'s regressive policies in 
general toward political opponents occurring, ironically, 
alongside the steady march down the GOB\'s much trumpeted 
\"Road Map to Democracy.\"  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA NGOS LAY OUT CONSERVATION PRIORITIES 
 
REF: 2004 OESI FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR \"CONSERVATION 
 
     GATEWAY\" 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: A team of locally based environmental NGOs, 
backed by local experts, has produced a comprehensive 
analysis of Burma\'s most pressing priorities for biodiversity 
conservation.  The report is the first of its kind that we\'ve 
seen and is realistic in its objectives and its assessment of 
the key barriers to success: weak civil society, limited 
resources, and poor government policies.  We think the USG 
can help address some of the report\'s central challenges 
without violating restrictions on passing assistance to the 
GOB.  End summary. 
 
First, Identify the Problem 
 
2. (U) A Rangoon-based contractor for UK NGO BirdLife 
International led a small team of Rangoon-based INGOs in 
drafting a comprehensive assessment of Burma\'s conservation 
priorities (pouched to EAP/BCLTV).  The report, entitled 
\"Investment Opportunities in Biodiversity Conservation by 
Civil Society in Myanmar,\" was drafted at the behest of a 
group of local environmental NGOs and academics following an 
August 2003 roundtable discussion of the critical situation 
for Burma\'s biodiversity.  The Chief of Mission (COM) and 
econoff attended a July 9 briefing on the results of the 
assessment. 
 
3. (U) The group, and subsequent draft report, identified in 
Burma 72 priority sites, ten priority corridors, and at least 
145 globally threatened species in Burma.  The major threats 
to these areas and species were: (1) overexploitation of 
certain animal species for food and the international 
wildlife trade (mostly to China), (2) habitat loss (from 
logging and infrastructure projects), (3) conversion to farm 
land (especially oil palms); and, to a lesser degree, (4) 
invasive species and (5) pollution.  The report\'s authors 
were cautious not to put too much blame on the GOB for these 
situations, though they did clearly mention the negative 
impact of poor administration of environmental policies, 
anemic GOB spending on conservation, and environmentally 
unfriendly development and land-use policies. 
 
Next, Be Realistic 
 
4. (U) The NGOs and experts responsible for the report agreed 
that considering the poor state of civil society and a dearth 
of funding it was unrealistic to expect positive 
\"conservation outcomes\" for each of these priority areas. 
Thus, the report\'s authors established a more manageable list 
of areas where conservation partners could focus their 
energies. 
 
5. (U) In the final analysis, the experts chose seven 
priority corridors.  Within these corridors the authors 
identified 37 priority sites and four additional sites 
outside the corridors (because they contained globally 
endangered species or globally threatened species endemic to 
Burma).  Finally, the experts narrowed the list of species to 
38 -- including 11 globally endangered species and nine 
globally threatened species endemic to Burma. 
 
Better Coordination and Education Needed 
 
6. (U) The report also stressed the need for a better 
conservation infrastructure in Burma.  These \"thematic\" or 
strategic priorities included making biodiversity and 
conservation a part of broader GOB policy decisions, building 
civil society\'s capacity to participate in conservation, and 
improving coordination among local and international NGOs to 
most efficiently use limited resources. 
 
Who\'ll Foot the Bill? 
 
7. (U) One of the most important obstacles to achievement of 
the report\'s \"conservation outcomes\" is lack of funding.  The 
report blamed sanctions by \"western governments\" for 
discouraging investment in this area and also the GOB for not 
attaching enough budgetary importance to conservation.  The 
GOB as a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity 
has committed to providing financial support for biodiversity 
protection, however little has materialized.  Likewise local 
civil society and private sector actors have provided 
basically nothing for conservation.  Though the funds are 
lacking for effective protection, the report rightly 
recognizes the GOB\'s improving attitude toward conservation 
with its recent decisions to set aside two large areas of 
land as protected areas. 
 
8. (U) The report identifies the Japanese government and the 
UN as the largest bilateral and multilateral donors to Burma, 
though neither spend particularly much on conservation 
programs.  The multilateral development banks (MDBs) are not 
active in Burma due to Burma\'s arrears to the World Bank and 
U.S. opposition to MDB programming in Burma.  Likewise large 
private environmental funds, such as the Critical Ecosystem 
Partnership Fund, do not offer grants for Burma because they 
often receive significant contributions from the World Bank 
and other private foundations that will not support anything 
in Burma. 
 
9. (SBU) In this thrifty environment, the UN resident 
coordinator in Rangoon is taking the lead to try and respond 
to the the report\'s challenge to find investment.  In a 
sidebar conversation with the COM, representatives of the 
German and Japanese Embassies, and several INGOs, during the 
July 9 briefing, the UN official said he intends to approach 
the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) to see about getting 
GEF funding into Burma.  He cited the recent success of 
getting money approved for Burma from the Global Fund for TB, 
Malaria, and HIV/AIDS as evidence that proper monitoring and 
accountability mechanisms are in place here to receive 
disbursements of GEF funds.  The GEF focal point for Burma is 
the director of the National Commission for Environmental

Comment: There\'s Merit, But Not Money 
 
10. (SBU) We welcome the report as the first in-depth 
analysis of the country\'s conservation priorities.  The 
report is comprehensive and realistic in its scope and its 
prescriptions.  Finding funding will be a challenge, though 
the GEF may be a good (though longer-term) partial solution. 
In the more immediate term, we think the USG can help this 
worthy cause in a small way without violating restrictions on 
assisting the GOB.  Two of the report\'s strategic priorities 
(building civil society and improving NGO coordination) are 
precisely the objectives driving a proposed local 
\"Conservation Gateway\" NGO that would act as a clearinghouse 
for information, allow coordination among environmental NGOs 
already on the ground, and integration of new entrants (ref 
memo).  Minimal USG funding, either from OES or EAP 
resources, would get this Gateway up and running in short 
order.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  On July 14 Burma\'s Deputy Foreign Minister 
led a briefing of the Rangoon dipcorps on the recently 
adjourned National Convention (NC).  He did not rule out 
future participation by the NLD in the constitution drafting 
process, but gave no indication that efforts are underway to 
accommodate any opposition parties.  The otherwise standard 
GOB briefing only grew interesting during a testy Q and A 
period.  Numerous hard-hitting and pointed questions gave the 
DFM some indication that few, if any, among the international 
community view the Convention as a meaningful process. 
Nonetheless, the briefing was further evidence that the 
regime has no plans to deviate from a script that calls for 
Convention delegates to bless a pre-drafted constitution. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On July 14 Deputy Foreign Minister U Khin Maung Win 
led a briefing for the Rangoon diplomatic corps on the 
recently adjourned National Convention (ref A).  Several 
dozen embassies and international organizations were 
represented at the one hour event.  Although the DFM led off 
the session, he left the bulk of the cursory briefing to U 
Thaung Nyunt, the dour secretary of the NC\'s \"Convening Work 
Committee\" (ref B). 
 
3. (U) U Thaung Nyunt summarized the general proceedings to 
date of the National Convention, which reconvened on May 17 
and adjourned on July 9, and ongoing efforts to finalize the 
drafting of a new constitution.  He suggested that although 
nine of the constitution\'s chapters remain unfinished, little 
work would take place during the NC recess because delegate 
groups had already submitted discussion papers and proposals. 
 He added that the Convention itself was not encumbered by 
voting, because \"all discussions lead to a consensus.\" 
 
4. (U) An otherwise humdrum GOB briefing grew interesting 
during a testy question and answer period.  The German 
Ambassador chastised U Thaung Nyunt for giving a presentation 
that merely repeated information provided in state-run media 
and demanded that MFA officials \"shed more light on the NC 
process.\"  The Pakistan ambassador raised questions stemming 
from rumors that the NC had adjourned because of difficulties 
with the ethnic groups and because the GOB intended to draw 
in \"other political parties\" (read: the NLD).  The DFM 
dismissed these rumors and, ignoring the political party 
question, claimed that the NC had simply recessed for a 
scheduled adjournment to allow delegates to address personal 
business. 
 
5. (U) The COM pursued the political party angle and asked if 
the GOB would seek discussions with the NLD leading to future 
opposition participation in the Convention.  U Thaung Nyunt 
said that the GOB had already invited the NLD to attend, 
\"despite the party\'s demand for more seats,\" and suggested 
that the ball was in the NLD\'s court.  The DFM took the 
podium and declared that \"NLD participation depends on many 
factors and circumstances and we prefer not to go into any 
details at this time.\"  However, he allowed that the door was 
not closed on future NLD participation (Note: NLD CEC members 
told the COM and P/E chief later that evening that the GOB 
has not approached the party since negotiations broke down on 
May 13.  End note.) 
 
6. (U) The UK ambassador questioned the GOB officials about 
reports that the ethnic cease-fire groups (CFGs) at the NC 
were prohibited from submitting a proposal on states\' rights. 
 U Thaung Nyunt said \"like in a democracy, the other seven 
groups (of GOB hand-picked delegates) simply agreed not to 
accept the CFGs\' proposal.\"  The DFM interrupted and said 
that the proposals, which addressed power sharing scenarios, 
were never rejected; \"we simply asked the CFGs to withdraw 
their proposals because they offered ideas that are not in 
keeping with present conditions in the country.\" 
 
7. (C) Comment: Although DFM U Khin Maung Win, a former 
Fulbrighter and graduate of Johns Hopkins University, has 
emerged as one of the GOB\'s more polished spokesmen, the 
career diplomat had more difficulty than usual on this 
occasion satisfying a feisty diplomatic corps.  He seemed 
nonplused not just by the expected probing questions from the 
U.S. and EU missions but also by the pointed inquiries from 
several of the normally more reserved Ambassadors, which gave 
the DFM some indication that few in the international 
community view the National Convention as a meaningful 
process.  Nonetheless, the briefing was further evidence that 
the regime has no plans to deviate from its script which 
calls for Convention delegates to bless a pre-drafted 
constitution.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA\'S GARMENT SECTOR TAKES A TURN FOR THE BETTER 
 
REF: A. RANGOON 768 
 
     B. RANGOON 138 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: New garment orders from Europe and Canada 
have put about 25,000 back to work around Rangoon.  These 
orders are offering a much smaller profit margin than normal, 
though, thus the GOB is gaining little extra income from the 
new business.  Despite the good news, garment factory owners 
continue to suffer from low demand and poor competitiveness, 
though they swear they are not transshipping.    End summary. 
 
Europe and Canada to the Rescue 
 
2. (C) A senior member of Burma\'s Garment Manufacturers\' 
Association (GMA) told us that fresh orders from Europe and 
Canada this spring have proved a huge boon for the 
beleaguered sector.  Orders from Asia remain stagnant.  He 
noted, though, that production is still about 50 percent off 
from the same period last year -- prior to implementation of 
the U.S. import ban in August.  Also foreign buyers are only 
paying 50 percent of what they were paying last year, so 
profit margins are quite tight even as orders increase. 
 
3. (C) Nonetheless, he said that GMA members had been 
rehiring workers laid off since the import ban at a rapid 
pace to meet the new orders.  He estimated that 25,000 
workers had been re-hired so far this year.  (Note: Rangoon\'s 
semi-official \"Myanmar Times\" last week even had an article, 
in its English version, lauding increased employment in 
Rangoon\'s industrial zones, particularly garment factories.) 
However, he admitted that in 2003 and early 2004 lay-offs 
were about 15 percent higher than he had previously thought 
(ref B).  Thus, the net employment situation in the garment 
sector stands now about 45,000 off of pre-August 2003 levels. 
 The official was optimistic that the new orders would 
continue to come in throughout the summer, but he did not 
think there would be many additional hires.  Likewise, he 
said no closed factories had re-opened due to the new demand. 
 
4. (C) A South Korean Embassy official here concurred with 
the GMA assessment.  He told us that a handful of moribund 
Korean-owned garment factories (many if not most of the 
foreign garment factories here are run by Koreans) had come 
back to life due to new orders. 
 
Transshipment: \"Not Us!\" 
 
5. (C) We raised with the GMA official the problem of 
transshipment or relabeling of Burmese garments for export to 
the United States (ref A).  He denied that it could be a 
widespread problem, saying the profit margin for Burma\'s 
exclusively Cut, Manufacture, and Package (CMP) garment 
factories was far too slim to afford the extra expense of 
transshipping.  He said a transhipper to Thailand would have 
to pay huge bribes to Customs, particularly on the Thai side, 
or equally large transportation costs to smuggle the garments 
in small bundles across the river that marks the border.  He 
admitted, though, that he had \"heard\" some garment 
manufacturers here had been stuck with product following the 
advent of sanctions in August 2003 and had sent them overland 
through Thailand for relabeling and onward shipment to the 
United States.  He did not know the name of the Thai company 
used in this alleged transshipment. 
 
Comment: Good News for U.S. Policy 
 
6. (C) The recent turn of events in the garment sector is 
positive for U.S. policy objectives in two ways.  First, the 
rehiring has taken a chunk out of the unemployed garment 
workers, most of whom are young women (a fact used as 
anti-American propaganda by the regime).  Second, because the 
profit margins are slimmer than ever for the companies, the 
amount of money going into the GOB\'s coffers from this 
increased production of CMP garments is negligible.  End 
comment.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Leon de Riedmatten, UN Special Envoy 
Razali\'s representative in Rangoon, says that UNSYG Kofi 
Annan hopes to organize a consultative group meeting on Burma 
on the margins of the upcoming UNGA to discuss next steps and 
strategies.  The UNSYG will most likely invite traditional 
consultative partners on Burma--including the U.S., EU 
members, and Japan--as well as other \"influential\" countries 
such as China.  An invitation to the GOB is being considered, 
but is not certain.  Meanwhile, de Riedmatten says it is 
highly unlikely that the GOB will allow Razali to return to 
Burma in the near future, perhaps not even before the end of 
2004.  De Riedmatten, usually a source of optimism and 
energy, says he is frustrated by the unresolved stalemate in 
Burma and has run out of potential solutions.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Following a July 19 Martyr\'s Day commemoration at NLD 
headquarters (septel), COM and P/E chief met with Leon de 
Riedmatten, local representative for UN Special Envoy for 
Burma Razali Ismail.  De Riedmatten had recently returned 
from a trip to Bangkok where he joined Razali for 
Burma-related meetings on the margins of the international 
AIDS conference. 
 
3. (C) De Riedmatten said that he and Razali had met with 
UNSYG Kofi Annan in Bangkok to discuss developments in Burma 
and to consider a U.N. strategy for next steps.  According to 
De Riedmatten, the SYG was \"very well briefed\" on Burma and 
used the meeting to press Razali to be more proactive with 
his diplomatic efforts, rather than simply react to 
SPDC-controlled events inside Burma.  Implementing this 
advice, Razali and de Riedmatten flew to Vientiane to meet 
with the GOL and found the Lao \"well informed about the SPDC 
version of events, but nonetheless inquisitive about all 
developments in Rangoon.\" 
 
4. (C) The UNSYG also encouraged Razali to support Thailand\'s 
diplomatic efforts to engage the regime.  Razali subsequently 
met with PM Thaksin and found the RTG enthusiastic about 
pursuing the Bangkok process, despite being \"burned\" by the 
regime in April when the GOB pulled the plug on the Bangkok 
II meeting. 
 
5. (C) According to de Riedmatten, UNSYG Annan was receptive 
to Razali\'s pitch to organize a Burma meeting among 
interested foreign ministers in late September on the margins 
of the upcoming UNGA (ref B).  In fact, de Riedmatten said, 
the UNSYG committed to using UN Secretariat resources to pull 
the consultative meeting together.  The UNSYG would likely 
invite not only traditional participants in previous Burma 
meetings--including the U.S., EU members, and Japan--but 
would also reach out to other \"influential\" countries such as 
China and perhaps others in the region.  De Riedmatten said 
that an invitation for Burmese participation was not yet 
certain. 
 
6. (C) Turning to the Burmese political stalemate, de 
Riedmatten said it was unlikely the SPDC would allow Razali 
to visit Burma anytime soon, perhaps not even before the end 
of 2004.  He observed that the generals are \"very 
comfortable\" with the status quo and are not feeling any 
particular international pressure.  To the contrary, de 
Riedmatten said, ASEAN\'s tepid statement at the ARF had given 
the GOB a free pass (Note: De Riedmatten said he had seen an 
early draft of the ASEAN statement which was \"fairly hard 
hitting\" until the GOB succeeded in getting a watered-down 
final version.  End note.) 
 
7. (S) De Riedmatten said he continued to be perplexed by the 
lack of communication from Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains 
under house arrest but has an ongoing, proven ability to 
communicate clandestinely.  De Riedmatten, a long-time 
confidant of ASSK\'s, said he regularly sends in briefing and 
background papers, but in recent months has rarely heard 
anything in response.  \"She shows no sign of impatience or 
frustration,\" said de Riedmatten, \"and perhaps I even detect 
resignation.\"  He noted that he had at one point in the last 
few months recommended that ASSK consider civil disobedience 
as a tool to apply internal pressure on the regime.  ASSK 
turned down the option because in her view the NLD would not 
be able to secure widespread support for any acts of 
disobedience. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  De Riedmatten, usually optimistic about new 
possibilities and options, was unusually downbeat during our 
July 19 meeting.  \"I\'ve completely run out of ideas,\" he 
said, \"and I am at a loss about we can do next.\"  He was 
particularly frustrated with the NLD CEC, observing that 
their decision to take a pass on the National Convention was 
\"perhaps a sound and strategic decision, but in the interim 
they have done nothing and have failed to present any 
alternative strategy to the NC process.\"  He opined that the 
consultative meeting in New York could \"help to reinvigorate 
an international consensus\" but quickly added that such a 
meeting would not likely produce any meaningful results 
inside Burma.  End Comment.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  The GOB and the NLD marked Martyrs\' Day on 
July 19 with separate, low-key events.  The GOB, per its 
tradition, took all necessary measures to ensure a quiet and 
subdued holiday.  At NLD headquarters, opposition parties 
held a brief event for several hundred supporters, members, 
and diplomats and issued a statement criticizing the SPDC for 
ignoring the 1990 election results and for using \"irrelevant 
excuses\" to retain military control.  Meanwhile, NLD CEC 
members told Emboffs that on July 15 the NLD convened the 
Committee to Represent the People\'s Parliament (CRPP) for the 
first time in over 14 months and to date there have been no 
repercussions.  The SPDC, it appears, has succeeded in 
placing sufficient limits on the democracy movement and does 
not feel threatened by the occasional party event or meeting. 
 End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The GOB and the NLD marked Burma\'s 57th Martyrs\' Day 
on July 19 with separate, low-key events commemorating the 
1947 assassination of independence leader Aung San and 
members of his cabinet.  The GOB version was a \"ceremony,\" 
devoid of emotion or public participation, where officials 
and diplomats delivered wreaths and paid respects at the 
Soviet-style Martyrs\' Mausoleum in central Rangoon.  Security 
was extremely tight at the mausoleum, a \"public\" monument 
that has been generally closed to visitors since a 1983 
bombing orchestrated by North Korean agents that targeted the 
visiting ROK cabinet. 
 
3. (U) At NLD headquarters, opposition parties held a brief 
event for about 200 hundred supporters and political party 
members.  Some 25 diplomats were in attendance (including 
COMs from the U.S., UK, French, and German embassies as well 
as other diplomats from local UN missions and the Australian, 
Italian, and Japanese embassies).  In addition to an NLD 
statement read by party chairman U Aung Shwe, representatives 
from the Shan State Kokang National Democratic Convention 
Party, the Veteran Politicians, and the Kaman National League 
for Democracy (Arakan) delivered supporting speeches. 
 
4. (U) The NLD statement criticized the SPDC for ignoring the 
1990 legislative election results and for using \"irrelevant 
excuses\" to retain military control of the country, 
admonishing the generals to be honest with the Burmese people 
and admit \"we are holding on to power because we do not wish 
to relinquish it.\"  The NLD acknowledged that a 
constitutional convention is a \"true national need,\" but 
rejected the regime\'s current National Convention as one that 
did not result from consultations between the SPDC and the 
political parties that were victorious in 1990. 
 
5. (SBU) Curiously, while the NLD paid homage to founding 
father Aung San, the party made no reference to his daughter, 
NLD General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi, or to NLD Vice 
Chairman U Tin Oo, both of whom remain under house arrest. 
(Note: CNN International broadcast a Martyrs\' Day story on 
July 20, reporting incorrectly that ASSK had \"declined\" to 
attend events commemorating her father or to pay respects at 
the Mausoleum.  End Note.) 
 
6. (C) Meanwhile, as the NLD\'s official function was taking 
place, several small groups of NLD members attempted to enter 
the nearby Martyrs\' Mausoleum to pay their respects.  GOB 
security forces would only allow entrance to NLD members who 
removed party insignia, such as NLD pins, badges, and 
traditional jackets.  Several dozen party members complied 
and entered the monument grounds, while government soldiers 
blocked several dozen others who refused to obey.  (Note: 
NLD leaders, who described the NLD members as acting 
individually and not officially on behalf of the party, later 
told the COM and P/E chief on July 21 that military 
intelligence agents had closed down a nearby tea shop where 
NLD members had congregated after being turned away from the 
mausoleum, although there were no arrests.  End Note.) 
 
7. (C) On July 16, prior to Martyrs\' Day, Emboffs met 
privately with NLD CEC members U Aung Shwe and U Lwin to 
discuss party activities and plans for Martyrs\' Day and 
beyond.  Although they said that they were in communication 
with ASSK on an \"almost daily\" basis, the CEC members 
described the party as being in a \"wait and see\" mode with no 
plans for immediate action.  However, they did reveal that 
the CRPP (Committee to Represent the People\'s Parliament) had 
convened the day before, on July 15.  Twelve of the CRPP\'s 
fourteen surviving members attended the meeting (minus ASSK 
and U Tin Oo) and discussed the National Convention and other 
political developments.  According to U Lwin, the CRPP made 
no substantive decisions, but did agree to meet again and/or 
issue a statement on September 16, the 6th anniversary of the 
founding of the CRPP. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  The GOB, per its tradition, took all 
necessary measures to ensure that Martyrs\' Day was a quiet 
and subdued holiday.  The NLD, though critical of the regime, 
was considerably restrained, given in particular that ASSK 
and U Tin Oo remain under house arrest and all party offices, 
except for headquarters, remain shuttered.  As for the 
Committee to Represent the People\'s Parliament, this was the 
first meeting since the May 2003 Depeyin attack.  The SPDC 
has in the past perceived CRPP activities as provocation and 
frequently responded with arrests and other forms of 
harassment.  To date, the NLD and other political party 
leaders report no repercussions from the July 15 meeting. 
The SPDC, it appears, has succeeded in placing sufficient 
limits on the democracy movement and does not feel threatened 
by the occasional party event or meeting.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  According to NLD CEC members, the party 
quietly launched a petition drive on July 19 to secure 
signatures on a letter to the SPDC demanding that the regime 
release ASSK and U Tin Oo from house arrest, allow all party 
offices to reopen, and free all political prisoners.  To 
date, 66 MPs-elect and 456 other individuals have signed 
petitions although party leaders do not know, or will not 
reveal, what they will do with the petitions when the project 
is complete.  The CEC has invited NLD divisional and township 
leaders to expand the campaign through Burma, but the party 
says that success is uncertain given that all interior NLD 
offices remain shuttered.  NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe 
apologized for announcing the petition drive to the press 
before informing the U.S. and other supportive countries 
about the effort and committed to achieving better 
communications.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On July 21, COM and P/E chief called on NLD Chairman U 
Aung Shwe and Secretary/Spokesman U Lwin to discuss overnight 
international press reports that claimed the NLD had launched 
a petition campaign for signatures on an open letter to the 
SPDC.  According to the press reports, the NLD had kicked off 
the campaign at the party\'s July 19 Martyrs\' Day 
commemorative event (ref A).  However, Emboffs were present 
at that function and observed no petition-related activities. 
 
3. (S) U Aung Shwe acknowledged that the NLD had undertaken, 
with ASSK\'s blessing, a new campaign to garner signatures on 
a petition demanding that the SPDC release ASSK and U Tin Oo 
from house arrest, allow all party offices to reopen, and 
free all political prisoners.  However, the NLD CEC leaders 
said that they had only informed party members about the 
petition campaign during a closed-door session at party 
headquarters on July 19 after the departure of diplomats and 
other invited guests.  \"We needed to keep this effort 
confidential until the very last minute,\" explained U Aung 
 
SIPDIS 
Shwe, suggesting that the NLD did not want the SPDC to thwart 
their efforts. 
 
4. (S) According to the NLD CEC leaders, they have provided 
two petition books for signatures: one for Members-elect of 
Parliament and another for general party members and the 
public.  On the afternoon of Martyrs\' Day, about 200 
individuals signed the books at NLD headquarters.  To date, 
66 MPs-elect have signed the first book and 456 individuals 
have signed the second.  U Aung Shwe said that the CEC had 
invited NLD divisional and township leaders to expand the 
effort throughout Burma, although he added that he was unsure 
how they would succeed given that all interior NLD offices 
remain shuttered. 
 
5. (S) According to the NLD CEC members, the party does not 
know what it will do with the two petition books.  When we 
queried whether the NLD would deliver the books to the SPDC 
or otherwise publicize the results of the campaign, U Lwin 
replied, \"we\'re not sure.\"  He added that the regime has to 
date done nothing to impede party members and others from 
going to NLD headquarters to sign the petitions. 
 
6. (S) COM also asked the party leaders about the recent 
convening of the Committee to Represent the People\'s 
Parliament (ref A).  U Aung Shwe, requesting that his 
information remain confidential, said that the CRPP is 
preparing a report on next steps for the pro-democracy 
movement.  However, he added that the NLD did not know what 
the paper would address or when it would be completed.  P/E 
chief noted local rumors that NLD rank and file members were 
demanding more action from the NLD CEC.  U Aung Shwe 
acknowledged that some members were frustrated and pressing 
for a more proactive stance, but he dismissed them as \"just a 
few individuals.\" 
 
7. (S) COM asked the two NLD leaders if they desired a 
statement of support or other assistance for their petition 
drive.  U Aung Shwe demurred, but replied \"feel free to let 
Washington know about our campaign and that we plan to 
continue the effort until the end of August.\" 
 
Comment: Help Us Help You 
------------------------- 
 
8. (S) Low-level NLD sources claim that the petition campaign 
was actually the initiative of regional NLD party members and 
that the CEC reluctantly took ownership at the last minute. 
U Aung Shwe and U Lwin, however, insisted to us that the CEC 
had launched the effort and that ASSK was fully on board. 
 
9. (S) The COM took the opportunity to once again urge the 
CEC members to communicate more closely with the U.S. 
Embassy, noting that she and several other Emboffs had met 
with them on four separate occasions in the past six days and 
heard nothing from them about their petition effort (ref A). 
\"Help us help you,\" she said, noting that NLD supporters in 
Congress and elsewhere in the U.S. frequently look to the 
State Department to ascertain the validity of press reports 
on NLD developments inside Burma.  U Aung Shwe apologized, 
repeating the party\'s desire to keep their effort 
confidential but acknowledging that party leaders had talked 
 
SIPDIS 
with journalists before talking with U.S. and others who 
support NLD efforts to pursue reconciliation and democracy. 
He and U Lwin committed to keeping the U.S. informed on 
future developments and said they \"fully appreciated that the 
U.S. Embassy has closely supported the NLD ever since 1988.\"

1.  Summary: Dr. Jack Chow, Assistant Director-General for 
the World Health Organization for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria (HTM), called on the COM on July 21 to discuss his 
visit to Burma during which he met with the GOB Minister of 
Health and other health officials, announced 92 million in 
new funding for Burma to help combat the spread of HTM, and 
discussed the WHO\'s \"3 by 5\" global initiative for combating 
HIV/AIDS.  End Summary. 
 
2.  WHO Assistant Director-General Dr. Jack Chow (former U.S. 
AIDS envoy) told the Chief of Mission on July 21 that earlier 
in the week he had met with GOB Minister of Health Dr. Kyaw 
Myint to announce that Burma is to receive a Global Fund 
grant, totaling 92 million over the next 5 years, to combat 
the three target diseases of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
malaria.  Chow commented that the GOB has made progress in 
admitting that there is a serious HIV/AIDS problem in Burma 
and that \"now, no one denies AIDS exists here.\"  Chow said 
that Kyaw Myint welcomed international support to combat 
HIV/AIDS, and the Health Minister also communicated how much 
he had valued a 2003 CDC visit, adding that the GOB would 
very much welcome another visit in the future. 
 
3.  According to Dr. Chow, the Health Minister said he was 
\"stunned and jealous\" by the number of INGOs operating in 
Thailand, which he had observed firsthand after attending the 
International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, and indicated that 
he was open to advice and support from such international 
groups.  (Note: in a previous conversation between COM and 
MOFA Political Director General U Thaung Tun, the DG 
expressed concerns that the President\'s Emergency Plan for 
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) would result in a \"counter productive\" 
proliferation of NGOs in Burma, per ref A.  End Note).  Dr. 
Chow opined that the minister\'s \"rhetoric was ahead of his 
(GOB) team,\" but said that support from the WHO would give 
the minister a \"deliverable\" for fighting HTM, which would 
help him garner support from his GOB counterparts. 
 
4.  Dr. Chow went on to discuss the WHO,s \"3 by 5\" treatment 
target and said that part of the aid Burma receives will be 
to implement this program, in conjunction with the greater 
HTM program, to combat these three \"global diseases of 
poverty.\"  According to Chow, there are plans in the works to 
hold a signing ceremony in Rangoon to initiate the grant 
agreement, possibly sometime in the next month, and he is 
hopeful that Richard Feacham, Executive Director of The 
Global Fund, will attend.  Dr. Chow also hopes to return to 
Rangoon for the initiation of the program.  The grant to 
Burma will be administered through the UNDP, which will be 
the principle recipient and manager for the program. 
 
6.  Comment:  The Minister of Health\'s positive response to 
the WHO is encouraging in the fight against AIDS, as is the 
substantial funding from the Global Fund.  However, 
infrastructure problems, a lack of proper medical facilities, 
and lingering issues over confidential testing may hamper 
efforts to treat patients.  The WHO,s \"3 by 5\" program also 
aims to strengthen health systems and technical assistance 
in-country, a necessity in Burma with its meager health 
facilities.  The GOB\'s growing openness toward discussing 
treatments and prevention for HIV/AIDS is also good sign, 
particularly in a country where, until recently, condoms were 
illegal and government denial made the disease all but 
unmentionable.  End Comment

SUBJECT: IRRAWADDY FLOODING DRAWS SCANT INTEREST 
 
1. (SBU) Starting July 18th, heavy rains caused the upper 
Irrawaddy River to overflow its banks, and flood waters 
reportedly reached four to ten feet in the Kachin State 
capital of Myitkyina.  Local NGOs in Myitkyina reported the 
worst flooding since 1997, fouled wells, thousands homeless, 
and perhaps 50 dead.  Other Kachin towns down river of 
Myitkyina also reported flooding, though we have no 
information on any major destruction or casualties.  Local 
sources tell us the waters in Kachin State are receding. 
 
2. (SBU) By July 25th the Irrawaddy flooding was beginning to 
affect Mandalay (about 250 miles down river from Myitkyina). 
Local NGO officials told A/DCM and visiting EAP/BCLTV deputy 
director, traveling in Mandalay, that the situation looked to 
be the worst for thirty years -- though they knew of no 
significant damage or loss of life yet.  Already the waters 
are beginning to wash over the Rangoon-Mandalay highway and 
parallel railway line, both built near the river.  Damage to 
these transport routes could cause significant economic 
problems as Mandalay, Burma\'s second largest city, is the 
commercial hub for supplying most of Upper and Central Burma 
with goods brought in from China. 
 
3. (SBU) Despite the worrying situation, thus far the GOB has 
taken no visible action nor asked for international 
assistance.  In the July 28th edition of regime mouthpiece 
\"The New Light of Myanmar,\" an article recounts a July 24-25 
visit to Myitkyina by the SPDC\'s Secretary Two (S-2) Lt. Gen. 
Thein Sein.  S-2, after \"fulfilling the requirements of the 
victims,\" told local officials that this type of flooding was 
normal and that \"such kind of incident does not last long.\" 
He added that, in any event, \"the magnitude of damage and 
loss was small.\"  According to the UNDP in Rangoon, and the 
UN resident coordinator, UN agencies in Burma are closely 
monitoring the flooding and have told the GOB they are 
prepared to offer assistance.  No such request has come yet, 
though, so the UN has not yet mounted any relief efforts. 
 
4. (SBU) On July 27th, the MOFA Director General for 
Political Affairs U Thaung Tun, in a meeting with EAP/BCLTV 
deputy director and P/E chief, was equally dismissive of the 
flooding.  \"It\'s not as bad as it looks,\" he said, \"and while 
we would accept help from our friends, we have no plans to 
request assistance from the UN community.\"

     C. 03 RANGOON 1417 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: There has been much talk recently of 
perceived \"rifts\" in the senior military leadership of Burma 
and between the regional commanders and the central command 
structure.  Some claim that these rifts are based on starkly 
differing views on the best political path for Burma to take. 
 However, they are likely more deeply rooted in a 
long-standing and complex web of friction over economic 
interests and fundamental intra-military rivalries.  In any 
event, we see no way that these economic and other 
differences will lead to any systemic change.  End summary. 
 
Political Differences are Skin Deep 
 
2. (C) It has become popular lately to blame perceived 
frictions among the senior leaders, between combat troops and 
military intelligence (MI), and between field commanders and 
the central command on fundamental political differences.  We 
are skeptical that any such differences would go very deep. 
Military leaders across the board are in the same boat 
politically.  It\'s hard to envision any democratic political 
system in which any military leader would be better off than 
he is now.  Thus we believe it is more appropriate to look at 
traditional academic and economic rivalries when seeking to 
explain any internecine conflict. 
 
My Old School 
 
3. (C) The long-standing rivalry between graduates of various 
military officer programs cannot be ignored but shouldn\'t be 
overstated.  Traditionally there were four ways to become an 
officer: do four years (now three years) of university study 
at the highly selective Defense Services Academy (DSA); do a 
post-graduate year-long course at the Officers Training 
School (OTS); do a two-year post-high school apprenticeship 
program followed by a year in the field; or, make your way up 
the ranks based on merit, connections, or luck.  The latter 
two systems have the fewest representatives in the top 
echelon, and the apprenticeship program was reportedly 
scrapped a few years ago.  Thus, the most politically 
important actors in Burma are generally DSA graduates (who 
view themselves as the elite \"West Pointers\" of the Tatmadaw) 
and those of the OTS (who have some jealousy of the DSA grads 
but think of themselves as more worldly as they\'ve attended 
university outside the military sphere).  There is also a 
particular bond between graduates of DSA, who call each other 
\"brother,\" and in particular those of like classes (or 
\"batches\") who have regular reunions. 
 
4. (C) The current leadership is well divided between the 
different schools.  SPDC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe 
(1954) and Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt (1960) are OTS, 
while SPDC number two Vice Senior General Maung Aye (1959) 
and rising star Lieutenant General Shwe Mann (1969) are DSA. 
This could explain some of the purported tension between Khin 
Nyunt and Maung Aye.  However, it cannot be assumed that 
differing military educational background is the most 
important element in intra-service relationships.  Graduates 
of different schools also often make good bedfellows: Shwe 
Mann (DSA) is known to be a right-hand man of Than Shwe 
(OTS).  Also, graduates of the same schools can be rivals or 
enemies.  For example Maung Aye and Shwe Mann (both DSA) are 
thought to be competing to succeed Than Shwe and there are 
rumors that Khin Nyunt and Than Shwe (both OTS) don\'t see eye 
to eye on some issues.  Outside of the SPDC, we note that a 
similar trend is visible.  For instance, Senior General Than 
Shwe\'s most trusted toady in military intelligence is a DSA 
grad -- MI Deputy Chief Major General Kyaw Win.  Similarly, 
Khin Nyunt\'s closest deputy, Brigadier General Kyaw Thein, is 
DSA. 
 
MI and the Army: Economic Divisions of Labor 
 
5. (C) The business interests of the regional commanders and 
other combat troops (the \"Tatmadaw\"), championed on the 
national level by Vice Senior General Maung Aye, are based 
largely on graft and muscle.  These officers, often tasked by 
their superiors to be self supporting, skim from local 
businesses, sell off military supplies (particularly food and 
fuel), force private entities to partner with them 
(especially in extractive industries), collect road tolls, 
offer protection services, etc.  General Maung Aye, as 
chairman of the Trade Policy Committee also has significant 
authority over extremely lucrative import licenses, which he 
doles out to favored civilian and military cronies.  Two 
enormous exceptions to the Tatmadaw\'s normal, more mercenary, 
approach to business come with the military-controlled 
corporations: the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and 
Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd. (MEHL).  The latter 
conglomerate in particular, whose shares are majority owned 
by the various regional commands, runs business ventures 
across the spectrum either independently or in a joint 
venture partnership (ref C). 
 
6. (C) In contrast to the regional commands, the vast MI 
apparatus (controlled by Prime Minister Khin Nyunt) is a far 
more sophisticated \"mafia-like\" operation.  Aside from taking 
graft and running protection rackets, MI divides up its 
territory and is very active running its own small business 
fronts, especially hotels and restaurants, and controlling 
essential junctures of the economy -- such as the informal 
financial remittance system and border trade smuggling.  It 
also has a hand deep into the entertainment industry -- 
gambling, karaoke, nightclubs, and some prostitution. 
Regional MI commanders can also use their leverage over 
regional commanders to horn in on the economic rents being 
earned by these Tatmadaw officers -- who are usually much 
higher rank than their MI colleagues.  This is much resented, 
but there is little the regional commander can do if he 
wishes to avoid a bad report going into his MI file. 
 
Turf Wars 
 
7. (C) Aside from MI \"poaching,\" another factor generating 
tensions in the ranks is the expanding economic role of 
ethnic cease-fire groups (CFGs) -- given economic concessions 
a decade or more ago by Prime Minister, then Secretary One, 
Khin Nyunt in exchange for peace.  These groups -- such as 
the Wa, Kokang, Kachin, and Pa-O -- are seen as affiliated 
with the MI because of the primary role played by General 
Khin Nyunt in the negotiation of the cease-fire accords and 
the long animosity between these groups and the combat troops 
against whom they fought for many years. 
 
8. (C) As the CFGs grow wealthier from their local 
concessions, they have expanded outside of their designated 
\"special regions\" and are bringing their capital and 
connections into ethnic Burman areas, stealing market share 
in areas that were traditionally the feeding trough of the 
regional commanders.  One active Rangoon businessman told us 
that when he wanted to set up shop in Bago, about 50 miles 
northeast of Rangoon, he engaged a transplanted ethnic Wa 
fixer rather than dealing directly with the regional 
commander.  Another Rangoon businessman agreed with this 
decision, saying the CFG leader is likely to be a much 
longer-term business partner than a regional commander who 
could be transferred anytime. 
 
9. (C) This is a new phenomenon and has the potential of 
expanding MI-Tatmadaw acrimony in the future.  Despite any 
anger the regional commander might feel, these CFG reps are 
seen as \"untouchable\" because of their close ties with the 
Prime Minister and MI.  This area of conflict is only 
lessened now, we have been told, by CFG desires to minimize 
antagonism with the regional commanders to reduce 
interference in any ongoing illegal activities. 
 
Business and Family are Key for Big Three 
 
10. (C) This business-based conflict between various elements 
of the military trickles up, with complaints at the local 
levels eventually reaching the ears of respective \"champions\" 
in Rangoon.  Friction ensues as the Prime Minister and Maung 
Aye try to maximize their respective civilian patronage 
networks and keep their respective troops fat and happy.  The 
veto power of Senior General Than Shwe, who is very weak in 
business and economic matters, adds to the discord and 
confusion. 
 
11. (C) Some retired military officers now in business argue 
that Than Shwe abhors business and does not like his 
subordinates involved in it.  Supporting this theory, Than 
Shwe\'s children, with one notable exception, are not involved 
in large economic concerns as are most other privileged kids 
of senior military officials.  Most of Than Shwe\'s known 
offspring are in the foreign ministry, others just lazily 
reap the low-lying fruit granted them as progeny of \"Number 
One.\"  On the contrary, General Khin Nyunt has been described 
by Rangoon businessmen as a \"Thaksin-like\" Prime Minister, 
seeking to dominate both the economic and political worlds. 
He and his MI apparatus are like economic octopi trying to 
take a leading role in all the perceived \"cutting edge\" 
sectors like tourism, IT, etc.  The PM has set up two of his 
three sons (the third is a senior MI officer) in powerful 
economic positions: one is the head of the country\'s dominant 
IT firm and another is the publisher of a respected business 
magazine (among other business interests). 
 
12. (C) Vice Senior General Maung Aye is deeply interested in 
business, but has thus far his family has been incapable of 
competing with Khin Nyunt\'s for economic dominance.  Maung 
Aye\'s daughter runs Queenstar computer business, which has 
not flourished in competition with Khin Nyunt\'s 
well-organized control of the industry (either directly or 
through an MI-managed Computer Association of private firms 
who were allocated market share). 
 
Comment: Will They Play Nice? 
 
13. (C) The bottom line is that there is no evidence to 
support the conclusion that high-level frictions are caused 
by differing views of the country\'s destiny or the path to 
it.  There are other areas of rivalry that have been a source 
of friction for many years and will likely continue to be so. 
 Rivalries over dividing the economic pie are manifold and 
complex and will continue to grow if the economy becomes more 
open to regional foreign trade and investment and as the CFGs 
continue to edge up to the table.  While these areas of 
disagreement may be bad for morale, and cause anxiety among 
the top echelon, they are not serious enough to upset the 
apple cart.  As long as the regime continues to run its 
country according to plan, with little successful 
international or domestic pressure, the desire to maintain a 
common political front will surmount any other areas of 
discord.  End comment.

1.  (C) Summary:  Both the PRC Embassy and the Burmese 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) described Burmese Prime 
Minister Khin Nyunt\'s 11-18 July visit to China, his eighth 
overall though the first as PM, as a huge success.  The 
visit, during which Khin Nyunt met senior Chinese leaders and 
reportedly discussed Burma\'s \"road map\" to democracy, focused 
heavily on economics and resulted in 12 signed agreements 
(detailed below).  Both the PRC CDA and a MOFA official 
alluded to problems with Burma\'s capacity to move forward on 
joint projects in a timely manner.  In related events, the 
COM offered to broker an informal exchange between Chinese 
Embassy officials and NLD members at her residence.  COM also 
raised with the PRC CDA press reports claiming a purported 
U.S.-based Chinese dissident had been arrested in Burma and 
turned over to Chinese authorities.  Separately, an NLD CEC 
member told the PRC DCM that the PRC model of economic 
development leading to political change was a good model for

Is the Carrot Too Big For the Stick? 
 
3.  (C) COM and Pol/Econoff met with Chinese Charge 
d\'Affaires (CDA) Yu Boren on July 23 for a readout of the 
11-18 July visit to China of Burmese Prime Minister (PM) 
General Khin Nyunt.  Yu\'s comments were consistent with those 
reported ref A.  Yu described the visit, the eighth by Khin 
Nyunt to China but his first as PM, as successful, resulting 
in 11 (actually 12) signed agreements, and confirmed that at 
seven days, it was somewhat longer than similar trips hosted 
by China for foreign dignitaries.  Yu said the focus of 
discussions had been bilateral relations, noting that Khin 
Nyunt\'s access to President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen JiaBao, 
Chairman of the National People\'s Congress Wu Bangguo, and 
Politburo Standing Committee Member Luo Gan illustrated the 
importance China had attached to the visit.  On the political 
side, Yu said Khin Nyunt had raised Burma\'s National 
Convention and stressed his commitment to the \"road map\" to 
democracy in his meetings with Chinese leaders.  In response, 
Yu claimed China urged accelerated democratization and 
political reconciliation, while reaffirming its policy of 
non-interference in Burma\'s internal affairs. 
 
4.  (C) COM asked Yu how China reconciled what appeared to be 
diverging messages to the GOB, encouraging accelerated 
political reform while providing continued and extensive 
economic assistance not tied to progress on the political 
front.  Yu said that the GOB attached great importance to 
China\'s advice and that China had urged the GOB to respond 
positively to international offers of assistance and to move 
forward with political reconciliation.  Yu pointed to Khin 
Nyunt\'s comments to Chinese leaders that political stability 
led to economic growth as evidence of Khin Nyunt\'s commitment 
to move forward with democratization. (Comment: A rather 
optimistic interpretation in our view. End Comment.) 
 
5.  (C) COM pressed Yu for details on several of the new 
economic agreements, including the size of a debt 
rescheduling agreement (ref C); what the \"Master Plan for 
Hydropower Projects\" entailed; and whether the GOB was able 
to use/spend the aid/loans being provided by China 
effectively.  Yu did not offer any statistics on debt 
rescheduling.  On hydroelectric power, he said that China\'s 
objective was to help Burma harness its considerable water 
resources to generate local electricity for domestic 
consumption.  Yu assessed that Chinese economic assistance 
had been somewhat effective overall, but did not provide 
details.  He noted some Chinese-sponsored projects had not 
been successful because insufficient attention had been paid 
to issues such as the local availability of needed raw 
materials and markets.  Yu remarked that the GOB needed to 
adopt a new style of economic management, which is why the 
GOB delegation\'s visit to several of China\'s Special Economic 
Zones (SEZ) had been so important. 
 
6.  (C) On the margins of the discussion, COM offered to host 
a lunch to broker an informal exchange between Chinese 
Embassy officials and NLD members at her residence; Yu said 
he would raise the matter with his ambassador.  COM also 
asked about press reports claiming that in late May, a 
purported U.S.-based Chinese dissident, Peng Ming, had been 
arrested in Burma and turned over to Chinese authorities. 
Yu, with apparent sincerity, said that he had no knowledge of 
the incident; requested copies of the relevant press reports; 
and commented in English that China and Burma have a \"special 
relationship\" and that \"if would be dangerous for such people 
to come here.\"  (Note:  GOB sources separately affirmed that 
Burmese authorities arrested and handed Peng Ming over to PRC 
officials in late May.  End Note.) 
 
The Burmese Take... 
 
7.  (C) MOFA DG for Political Affairs, U Thaung Tun, in a 
July 27 meeting with visiting EAP/BCLTV deputy director and 
P/E chief, said Khin Nyunt\'s visit was a logical step \"in a 
history of long relations\" and that the Chinese \"went the 
extra mile\" to put on a productive and welcoming visit.  The 
DG said Khin Nyunt held a number of senior-level meetings to 
discuss expanding bilateral cooperation (especially in the 
energy and counternarcotics sectors) and to address regional 
peace and security issues (including initiatives to increase 
ASEAN integration with greater Asia). Pol/Econoff separately 
met with MOFA Assistant Director (AD) of the East Asia and 
Pacific Division Political Department U Aung Kyaw Zan on 
August 2.  The AD described Khin Nyunt,s visit as 
\"successful and very significant\" and provided a detailed 
overview of the 12 agreements that had been signed (see below 
annex).  The AD noted that Khin Nyunt and Luo Gan had 
discussed expanding the scope of cooperation on border issues 
beyond the parameters of an agreement signed in 1997.  Areas 
identified for broadened cooperation were narcotics, 
transnational crime, and boundary issues.  The AD suggested 
that there were plans to open two or three additional border 
points within the next few years. 
 
8.  (C) The AD said the most important of the 12 agreements 
signed was the one related to hydropower, which includes 
Chinese support for a 750 megawatt power plant.  (Note:  In 
contrast to information received from the Chinese CDA, MOFA 
DG and AD said 12 agreements had been signed; 11 in Beijing 
and a 12th in Shenzhen.  A list of the agreements is provided 
below; all detail was provided by MOFA AD.)  When asked if 
there were any points of friction in the Sino-Burma 
relationship, the AD remarked that the Chinese have been 
disappointed with Burma\'s ability to implement projects in a 
timely manner, although he characterized the issue as 
\"minor.\"  The AD said that Khin Nyunt had extended an 
invitation to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to visit Burma, but 
that there had been no discussion of possible timing thus 
far. 
 
 
NLD CEC Member Meets Chinese DCM 
 
9.   (C) At a reception hosted by COM July 27, P/E Chief 
facilitated the introduction of NLD CEC member and economic 
policy advisor U Nyunt Wei and Chinese DCM Yu Boren.  During 
the ensuing conversation, Yu stated that Burma had made 
progress on economic development but that more needed to be 
done.  Yu characterized Khin Nyunt as someone who had a true 
understanding of the type of economic development strategy 
Burma needed to employ in order to advance; but was 
noncommittal on whether he believed Khin Nyunt had the 
authority to move forward with his economic agenda.  For his 
part, Nyunt Wei indicated that the Chinese model, which he 
defined as pursuing economic development and transition to a 
market economy in order to achieve increased political 
freedoms, was one that Burma should seek to emulate. 
 
China:  Friend or Foe? 
 
10.  (C) When asked whether Chinese economic assistance was 
viewed by the majority of Burmese people as generally 
positive or negative, an NLD MP-Elect said that many Burmese 
viewed the Chinese with suspicion and considered Chinese 
products available in the Burmese market to be of extremely 
low quality.  MOFA AD was somewhat less negative, expressing 
his view that while there was suspicion and mistrust, there 
also was recognition that China was bringing benefits to 
Burma.  The AD was unwilling to engage on the degree to which 
senior SPDC leaders, some of whom had been involved in 
suppressing the Burmese Communist insurgency, harbored 
lingering mistrust of Chinese intentions. 
 
Annex:  List of Signed Agreements 
 
11.  (U) The following is a list of signed agreements between 
the PRC and the GOB (all detail provided by GOB): 
 
1) Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation between 
the Government of the Union of Myanmar and the Government of 
the People\'s Republic of China.  China is to provide a mobile 
x-ray container for use in border inspections on the 
China/Burma border. (ref B) 
 
2) Exchange of Notes on the Project of International 
Convention Center.  China is to send experts to Burma to 
identify and survey a site for a new international convention 
center, construction of which is to be completed prior to 
Burma\'s assumption of the ASEAN Chairmanship in 2006. 
 
3) Exchange of Notes on the Master Plan for Hydropower 
Projects in Myanmar.  China will provide a $5 million grant 
to formulate a comprehensive hydropower plan for Burma; this 
agreement was an outgrowth of the March 2004 visit by Vice 
Premier Wu Yi. 
 
4) Exchange of Notes on the Master Plan for Thanlyin-Kyauktan 
Industrial Zone.  Myanmar has invited unnamed/unspecified 
Chinese companies, many of which are based in Shanghai, to 
invest in the industrial zone, which will focus on 
information technology and the information industry.  While 
Myanmar is using China\'s Special Economic Zones (SEZ) as a 
model for this initiative, Myanmar is not seeking to emulate

5) Exchange of Notes extending 50 Million RMB Yuan 
interest-free loan for the provision and shipment of rails 
for the Myanmar Government. 
 
6) MoU between the Ministry of Communications, Posts and 
Telegraphs of the Union of Myanmar and the Ministry of 
Information Industry of the People\'s Republic of China in the 
field of Information and Communications.  China will assist 
Myanmar in formulating communications policy and development

8) Debt Rescheduling Agreement between China Export & Credit 
Insurance Corporation and the Ministry of Finance & Revenue 
of the Union of Myanmar.  The agreement rescheduled $94 
million in debt that was due on November 1, 1999.  China has 
extended a two-year grace period, which started on July 1, 
2004.  (Note:  This is less than the $120 million in debt 
that an earlier draft of the agreement proposed to reschedule 
(ref C)).

1. (U) Summary: On August 4 the GOB Ministry of Health 
facilitated a signing ceremony in Rangoon which initiated the 
tuberculosis (TB) component of a Global Fund (GF) grant to 
Burma, the country\'s first tranche of funding from the GF. 
The first two-year phase of the TB component is for $6.9 
million, part of a $98.4 million grant package to combat TB, 
HIV/AIDS, and malaria in Burma.  The grant structure 
designates the UNDP as the Principle Recipient (PR) of the 
funding, KPMG as the auditor, and five local and 
international health NGOs as grant sub-recipients.  Several 
of the sub-recipients are GOB-affiliated and, to ensure 
transparency, all recipients, including UNDP, will be subject 
to stringent financial and technical auditing.  Any attempt 
by the GOB to manipulate this initial TB tranche would be 
risky business, given that over $90 million in remaining GF 
resources hang in the balance.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) At an August 4 signing ceremony to initiate Burma\'s 
first tranche of an anticipated five-year, $98.4 in Global 
Fund resources to fight TB, HIV/AIDS and malaria, Minister of 
Health Dr. Kyaw Myint stated that a $6.9 million grant 
agreement to fight tuberculosis was \"groundbreaking\" as it 
marked the first time Burma has received Global Fund 
assistance.  He noted that the TB funding would allow for 
improved treatment and detection of the disease, hopefully 
increasing recovery rates between 70 and 85 percent.  UNDP 
resident representative (and UN resident coordinator) 
Charles Petrie also spoke and emphasized the \"watershed\" 
nature of the TB component given that Burma was the first 
Global Fund recipient country to put into place all GF 
requirements and that future components (HIV/AIDS and 
malaria) will be modeled on this first program.  In his 
remarks, Petrie also cautioned that there are several steps 
that still need to be taken with the TB component, such as 
finalizing a procurement plan and completing capacity 
assessment of the sub-recipients. 
 
3. (U) The TB component consists of a $4.2 million grant over 
one-year and a total of $6.9 million over the next two years. 
 The UNDP will be the Principal Recipient (PR) and 
administrator of all Global Fund resources and a Local Fund 
Agent (LFA), KPMG, will audit both financial and technical 
aspects of the grant.  The TB sub-recipients include 
Population Services International (PSI;$570,748), the Myanmar 
Red Cross Society ($20,000), the Myanmar Medical Association 
($27,000), the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association 
($230,000), and the National TB Control Programme 
($6,149,379). 
 
4. (C) P/E officers met separately with UNDP rep Petrie 
subsequent to the signing ceremony to discuss details of the 
grant.  Petrie related that the Health Minister had \"gone out 
on a limb\" for the program, having relinquished considerable 
financial and programmatic control to the UNDP, and had been 
extremely nervous that the grant would fall through at the 
last minute.  Petrie was pleased that he had been able to get 
what he described as \"almost\" concessions from the Health 
Minister in order to satisfy all the GF requirements, but he 
noted that there were further issues to resolve regarding tax 
exemption status and exchange rate issues. 
 
The Auditor: Big Brother is Watching 
 
5. (SBU) Petrie emphasized the role of the outside auditor in 
the grant, stating that KMPG would be privy to everything 
UNDP does, to the point of being intrusive.  KMPG will review 
and evaluate every UNDP report before it goes to Geneva, and 
will be responsible for both financial and technical 
reviews--audits that Petrie said were far more substantial 
than in other GF recipient countries.  Petrie stated that in 
Burma complete transparency was the goal.  There will be such 
a degree of operational scrutiny that, for example, the 
independent auditor will monitor the chain of drug 
distribution all the way from distributor to patient. 
 
Sub-Recipients: Under a Watchful Eye 
 
6.  (SBU) According to Petrie, the sub-recipient 
organizations were selected after a thorough technical review 
and would all be subject to the same accounting procedures. 
Other than small payments for travel and per diem to 
community volunteers, no funds will flow directly to 
government organizations.  UNDP will pay all fees for 
services directly, and provide procurement of all goods, 
equipment, and commodities on behalf of the sub-recipients. 
Monitoring and evaluation of program performance will be 
conducted by \"technical sub-groups\" including UN agency 
partners (WHO and UNAIDS), NGOs, and national 
representatives.  For the TB component, the World Health 
Program (WHO) will lead the technical sub-groups in 
implementing monitoring and evaluation processes as well as 
technical support. 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  Burma\'s first Global Fund tranche arrives 
after several years of difficult negotiations and a series of 
rejected GOB applications.  GF managers sought to keep funds 
out of Government of Burma control and the resulting 
compromise grants UNDP sole responsibility for program 
results and financial accountability.  The reality, however, 
is hard to ignore.  The GOB \"owns\" Burma\'s efforts to tackle 
tuberculosis, a fact that GF managers clearly realized when 
accepting an arrangement to collaborate with the GOB\'s 
National TB Control Program and several local NGOs that have 
close ties with the regime.   Any attempt by the GOB to 
manipulate the initial TB tranche, however, would be risky 
business given that over $90 million in remaining GF 
resources hang in the balance.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The NLD CEC has established regular 
communications with ASSK and U Tin Oo.  An ongoing NLD 
petition drive to free the two leaders has proven minimally 
appealing to party members and supporters, and has also 
encountered some regime resistance in Mandalay and Sagaing 
divisions.  With the regime apparently ignoring the NLD and 
the party itself lacking plans for imminent action, NLD 
leaders assess accurately that the political environment is 
\"rather quiet these days.\"  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Charge d\'Affaires, a.i. and A/DCM met on August 10 
with NLD CEC members U Lwin and U Nyunt Wei.  U Lwin, 
describing the overall political environment as \"rather quiet 
these days,\" observed that the SPDC had made no overtures to 
the NLD since the party\'s decision in mid-May to boycott the 
National Convention (currently in recess).  He noted that the 
regime seemed more concerned with foreign affairs than with 
the domestic political opposition, citing Prime Minister Khin 
Nyunt\'s recent travels to China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and 
Cambodia. 
 
3. (C) The NLD is busy with an ongoing petition drive which, 
the CEC members said, \"was causing the authorities some 
concern\" (reftel).  According to U Lwin, the party has 
received about 1,000 signatures at headquarters, but 
considerably more upcountry (e.g. Magway Division, with over 
5,000 signatures).  U Lwin said that the petition drive was 
an optional undertaking for regional party leaders and was 
\"not popular everywhere,\" including Rangoon where many 
residents are \"more interested in playing the lottery.\" 
However, U Lwin added, most members of the Veteran 
Politicians group (pro-democracy, retired government 
officials) had signed the petition. 
 
4. (C) U Nyunt Wei said that the petition effort had 
encountered resistance in Mandalay and Sagaing Divisions. 
Local authorities had not physically impeded party members 
from signing the petition, but had put into place 
intimidating surveillance at signing locations.  And, 
according to U Lwin, USDA officials (the regime\'s mass-member 
organization which carried out the 2003 attack in Sagaing on 
ASSK and her NLD convoy) had warned local NLD leaders that 
the petition campaign could provoke anti-NLD elements and 
\"lead to clashes.\" 
 
5. (C) U Lwin said that the NLD CEC now maintains quiet, but 
regular, communications with ASSK.  \"We hear from her on a 
daily basis,\" said U Lwin, observing with surprise that he 
and his colleagues were able to send in parcels and letters 
to ASSK \"with no interference from the authorities.\"  (Note: 
We have used other channels in recent months to send in 
briefing papers and other messages, but have received no 
substantive responses.  End note.)  U Lwin also said that the 
CEC has regular contact with NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo, who 
is in \"good health and good spirits,\" via his wife who visits 
NLD headquarters daily.  U Lwin said, however, that neither 
ASSK nor U Tin Oo have been allowed to visit other CEC 
members since negotiations with the SPDC broke down in May. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  The CDA, a.i. used this opportunity to 
re-extend the Embassy\'s offer to assist the party in any way 
possible, including capacity building efforts through public 
diplomacy programs.  U Lwin and U Nyunt Wei did not cite any 
specific immediate needs, but intimated they would 
communicate the offer to ASSK.  While the two elderly leaders 
appeared to be in good spirits, they revealed no plans for 
imminent party action and said that had no timetable or 
specific objective for the petition campaign.  The NLD CEC 
plans to convoke the Committee to Represent the People\'s 
Parliament (CRPP) for that group\'s sixth anniversary in 
September, but has not yet developed an agenda.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: UNHCR\'s activities in the recently opened 
eastern border areas are gaining momentum.  As the GOB 
expands its preparations for possible future repatriation of 
refugees in Thailand, the UNHCR is expanding its roving 
presence and basic infrastructure work.  We support the UNHCR 
request for some short-term funds to get a larger expatriate 
presence in the region, a hotbed of human rights abuses, as 
soon as possible.  End summary. 
 
GOB Gets its Act Together 
 
2. (SBU) UNHCR\'s Rangoon representative Rajiv Kapur told the 
Chief of Mission on July 21st that UNHCR staff had just 
completed a fourth trip to the Thai border regions (areas of 
Karen and Mon States and Tanintharyi Division) since a 
February agreement with the GOB to allow UNHCR access to 
assess conditions for potential repatriation of refugees from 
Thailand (refs A and B).  Kapur said he was very pleased to 
see that the various Burmese army regional and tactical 
commanders in the area, after initial suspicion and reluctant 
cooperation, had come to \"accept UNHCR\'s mandate\" and are now 
helpful in facilitating UNHCR\'s trips.  Kapur reported no 
difficulties in going wherever and meeting with whomever he 
wanted. 
 
3. (C) He also said that the GOB is going full steam ahead in 
preparing the area for the potential returnees.  The 
government is actively upgrading 57 village tracts to 
sub-township level and planning for constructing schools, 
hospitals, and, naturally, offices for local \"Peace and 
Development\" Councils and Union Solidarity and Development 
Association (the regime\'s mass member organization) branches. 
 Kapur, one of the savviest UN officials in Burma, said it 
was evident this development campaign was primarily to ensure 
the regime\'s immediate political control of returnees.  Kapur 
said he has made it clear to GOB authorities that UNHCR would 
not support forced resettlement of returnees, when the time 
comes, to these sub-townships.  Returnees must have the right 
to settle in the towns or in the surrounding countryside as 
they chose. 
 
UNHCR Outreach Gets Moving 
 
4. (SBU) Nonetheless, Kapur was quite excited by plans for 
immediate UNHCR activity.  Though planning repatriation would 
wait until the government had finalized a cease-fire with the 
Karen National Union (KNU; refs C and D), there is work to be 
done for UNHCR upgrading water systems, sanitation, and 
existing schools and clinics.  He said the baseline 
conditions in the eastern border areas are far better than in 
northern Rakhine State (on the Bangladesh border) where UNHCR 
had to start from scratch building infrastructure for 
repatriated Rohingya refugees. 
 
5. (C) A positive element of these UNHCR advance missions is 
the regular visitation of expatriate officials into these 
previously off-limits areas -- hotbeds of human rights 
abuses.  Kapur pointed out that only ICRC and MSF-Holland 
have limited permanent expatriate staff in the eastern 
regions.  Senior Karen officials in Rangoon told us that they 
very much support having some UNHCR presence in the region. 
They said that Karen refugees and IDPs trust the UNHCR the 
most, even before their own political and military leaders. 
 
Balance of Power in Karen State 
 
6. (C) Kapur commented that during the course of his four 
trips he has had some revelations on the political balance of 
power in these border regions.  Particularly he described the 
weakness of the KNU, which controls only patchy and 
economically unviable areas around Myawaddy and in the Douna 
mountain range and is often surrounded by large detachments 
of GOB troops and rival militias.  Conversely, he noted, 
elements of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA; a 
splinter KNU group allied with the SPDC) are \"everywhere\" and 
their arrogant postures telegraph an intent to stay 
\"indefinitely.\" 
 
7. (C) On the economic side, Kapur noted that the DKBA is a 
major economic player in the region, particularly in the 
import-export business.  He said DKBA convoys bringing trade 
goods to and from the Myawaddy border crossing are 
commonplace.  An interesting twist, he said, is that the DKBA 
and KNU often pay protection money to each other to ensure 
safe passage through each other\'s zones of control. 
The Pitch: The Sooner the Better 
8. (C) Kapur made a pitch for immediate funds to expedite the 
formation of a larger and more permanent assessment officers\' 
presence in the eastern region.  He said that the EC, the 
Japanese, and the Australians have already contributed 
$400,000 each and he is hoping for $250,000 from the United 
States for the rest of CY 2004.  The money is needed now 
because there is nothing in the UNHCR\'s 2004 budget for the 
eastern border activities (as they were not foreseen during 
UNHCR\'s previous budget discussions) and UNHCR headquarters 
is unwilling to give additional funds for non-emergency 
extra-budgetary projects.  According to an August 3rd letter 
from Kapur, U.S. monies would be used for the salaries of six 
UNHCR international protection staff members ($239,600), 
travel expenses for assessment missions to the border region 
($5,980), two satellite phones ($2,520), and one laptop 
computer ($1,900). 
 
Comment: A Worthy Cause 
 
9. (C) It does not appear that there will be a formal UNHCR 
appeal for funding from HQ in Geneva.  Thus, we urge PRM and 
USAID to take a look at UNHCR-Burma\'s request.  We support 
expanding UNHCR\'s temporary international presence in this 
poorly understood area, which has been a hotbed of some of 
the GOB\'s most egregious human rights abuses in the past 
decades.  Likewise, active UNHCR participation in the GOB\'s 
preparatory work for returnees will help prevent any untoward 
activities and may diminish the risk of forcible 
repatriations.  Finally, we have been very impressed with 
UNHCR\'s work in Burma under its current management, which is 
quite firm with the GOB and avoids the rose-tinted glasses 
that often afflict UN operations here.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The National League for Democracy (NLD) on 
August 16 initiated a legal maneuver requesting that Burma\'s 
High Court order the GOB to release ASSK and U Tin Oo and to 
allow the party to reopen its offices.  NLD leaders are under 
no illusion that the effort will force the regime to respond. 
 Nonetheless, the party\'s quiet action could create a modicum 
of internal pressure on the GOB to deal with a democracy 
movement it has all but ignored for the past three months. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) NLD CEC member and party spokesman U Lwin met on 
August 16 with the A/DCM to inform the Embassy that his party 
was in the process of filing an appeal before Burma\'s High 
Court seeking the release of NLD leaders Aung San Suu Kyi 
(ASSK) and U Tin Oo and the reopening of NLD party offices 
throughout Burma.  The Burmese regime has for the past 15 
months detained the two NLD leaders and kept shuttered all 
NLD party offices outside of Rangoon. 
 
3. (C) According to U Lwin, on August 16 NLD Chairman U Aung 
Shwe and party lawyers began efforts to file a request in 
person before the High Court in Rangoon, while regional party 
officials undertook a simultaneous effort before the High 
Court in Mandalay.  The Rangoon request addressed 
specifically the detention of ASSK and U Tin Oo, who are 
under house arrest in the capital city, and the status of 
party offices throughout Lower Burma.  The action at the High 
Court in Mandalay, which has jurisdiction over civil matters 
in Upper Burma, dealt with the status of party offices in 
that region. 
 
4. (C) U Lwin emphasized that the NLD was not suing the GOB, 
but rather was requesting that the High Court intervene \"to 
correct illegal acts undertaken by the regime.\"  The party, 
in an effort that parallels the objectives of an ongoing 
petition drive (ref B), is seeking relief under a civil code 
\"Specific Relief Act\" that gives the High Court the authority 
\"to make an order requiring any specific act to be done... by 
any person holding a public office.\"  In other words, through 
its legal requests, the NLD wants to High Court to tell the 
GOB that it has no legal basis either to keep party offices 
closed or to continue holding ASSK and U Tin Oo under house 
arrest. 
 
5. (C) Comment:  The NLD has previously used legal tactics to 
advance political efforts or to stymie the regime\'s 
harassment and intimidation, including ongoing efforts to 
defend ASSK against politically-motivated civil and criminal 
suits initiated by a disgruntled brother and cousin, 
respectively.  NLD leaders are under no illusion that 
invoking the \"Specific Relief Act\" will force the GOB to 
allow the party to resume where it left off prior to the May 
2003 Depeyin attack.  Indeed, U Lwin acknowledged that High 
Court officials might refuse to accept the NLD petition (in 
which case the NLD plans to drop the requests in the mail and 
issue a press statement drawing attention to their actions). 
Nonetheless, the effort could create a modicum of internal 
pressure on the GOB to deal with a democracy movement it has 
all but ignored for the past three months.  End comment.

REF: RANGOON 887 (NOTAL DEA REPORT)

1. (C) Summary:  Burma\'s largest heroin seizure in history 
(592 kilos seized along the southern coast in early July) has 
uncovered a major drug trafficking syndicate with possible 
connections to traffickers and markets in Thailand, Vietnam, 
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Australia, India, and the United 
States.  Unusually, most of the local players are Muslim 
Sino-Burmese, with no ties to traditional traffickers based 
in the ethnic Wa and Kokang regions on the Chinese border. 
Likewise, the seized heroin appears to have originated in the 
Taunggyi area of southwest Shan State--not in Wa territory, 
Burma\'s traditional source for major heroin shipments.  More 
importantly perhaps, a post-seizure investigation has shed 
further light on a major sea-shipping route from Rangoon to 
the Andaman Sea, one which the GOB has virtually no capacity 
to thwart and may well offer drug traffickers a viable, 
low-risk option to move their product for the foreseeable 
future.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) A/DCM and PolEconoff met on August 13 with Burmese 
Police Colonel Hkam Awng to discuss details about an ongoing 
investigation into the seizures by GOB authorities of 592 
kilos of heroin in Tanintharyi (Tenasserim) Division in 
southern Burma (reftel).  Colonel Hkam Awng, as Joint 
Secretary of Burma\'s Central Committee for Drugs Abuse 
 
SIPDIS 
Control (CCDAC), is the GOB\'s lead working-level counterdrug 
official.  He described the combined seizure (well over 500 
kilos seized on July 9 and more than 70 kilos seized during 
subsequent searches) as the largest in Burmese history and 
one of the most significant in the world, with a \"street 
value\" of over USD 75 million. 
 
3. (SBU) According to Hkam Awng, the July 9 seizure was a 
case of good luck.  Local police in a small village on 
Burma\'s southern coast arrested a \"suspicious\" character on 
July 8, which led to additional arrests and the first of two 
related heroin seizures on the following day.  As reported 
reftel, a follow-on investigation determined that in late May 
smugglers were originally trafficking the heroin via a small 
fishing vessel through the Gulf of Martaban, just south of 
Rangoon, when crew members mutinied, murdered the vessel 
owner and two others, and brought the heroin ashore for 
storage. 
 
4. (C) Hkam Awng said that as a result of the seizure, the 
GOB has uncovered a major heroin trafficking syndicate. 
Burmese police have to date arrested 36 Burmese persons and 
are cooperating closely with the DEA, the Australian Federal 
Police, and Thai drug officials.  The investigation has thus 
far revealed possible connections to heroin traffickers and 
markets in Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Indonesia, 
Australia, India, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and 
Dallas.  Despite insights gained on the operational aspects 
of the syndicate, however, investigators have been unable to 
trace all financial flows associated with the heroin 
transactions. 
 
5. (C) Hkam Awng said that although the syndicate \"kingpins\" 
appear to be based in Taiwan and/or Hong Kong, most of the 
local players are young (late 20s, early 30s) Muslim 
Sino-Burmese men and women from Kengtung in eastern Shan 
State.  These individuals appear to have no ties to 
traditional Sino-Burmese drug traffickers, older men who are 
based in the ethnic Wa and Kokang border regions of northern 
Shan State.  A second unusual aspect is that the heroin 
seized appears to have originated in the Taunggyi area of 
southwest Shan State, a region that has experienced a 
dramatic decline in poppy cultivation in recent years, unlike 
northern Wa territory along the China border which is Burma\'s 
principal, and growing, source of poppy, opium, and heroin 
(as well as ATS). 
 
6. (C) Colonel Hkam Awng said that although the GOB was 
vaguely aware that traffickers had started shipping heroin 
south through Rangoon, the July 9 bust shed significant light 
on a major sea-shipping route--the scope of which has 
\"shocked and surprised\" GOB authorities.  GOB investigators 
have since discovered that the syndicate behind the July 9 
case has been operative since 2002 and is responsible for the 
trafficking of at least 2,000 kilos of heroin by land from 
Shan State to Rangoon and then onward to the Andaman Sea. 
The July 9 seizure was the fifth in a series of shipments, 
but, said Hkam Awng, \"we missed the first four, which 
averaged over 400 kilos each.\" 
 
7. (SBU) According to Hkam Awng, the syndicate\'s modus 
operandi has been to ship heroin from Rangoon by small 
fishing trawlers under cover of darkness.  Concealment of the 
drugs is rudimentary at best (i.e. heroin packed into 
coolers), but the traffickers are equipped with high-tech 
communication equipment including radios, satellite phones, 
and GPS devices.  The small boats then rendezvous south of 
Burma in the Andaman Sea with large cargo vessels.  In the 
case of the July 9 seizure, for example, traffickers had 
originally planned to transfer their heroin shipment to a 
1,000-plus ton Vietnamese-flagged cargo vessel. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  The GOB, Colonel Hkam Awng acknowledges, has 
a serious problem on its hands.  The July 9 heroin seizure 
and related arrests are good news for the country\'s 
counterdrug professionals and may have disrupted a 
substantial international syndicate.  However, the 
investigation into the July 9 case has also fully exposed a 
drug trafficking route which Burma has virtually no capacity 
to thwart.  The country has no Coast Guard and its poorly 
equipped Navy has no counterdrug mandate.  Customs inspection 
capabilities fall well below international standards and the 
ports are notoriously corrupt.  Absent senior-level GOB 
attention, substantial domestic resources to detect coastal 
trafficking activities, and close cooperation from 
neighboring countries, the \"southern sea route\" may well 
offer drug traffickers a viable, low-risk option to move 
their product for the foreseeable future.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: With the worst of Rangoon\'s dry season 
blackouts easing during the current monsoon rains, many are 
pondering whether the GOB will fix Burma\'s chronic energy 
problems before next spring.  Signs most definitely point to 
\'No.\' Burma\'s energy situation continues to suffer from three 
major problems: lack of access to natural gas, poor 
maintenance of existing infrastructure, and a single-minded 
obsession with vast hydropower projects whose finish dates 
are regularly missed.  We see very little to indicate the GOB 
intends to expand efforts to fix any of these. End summary. 
 
Don\'t Want Gas 
 
2. (SBU) Though Burma has abundant offshore, and some 
onshore, natural gas deposits the GOB has stubbornly refused 
to use these resources to feed domestic demand.  During 
2003-04\'s annual dry season (November-May) electricity 
crisis, the GOB did not change this position.  Instead, talk 
in policymaking circles remained focused on construction of a 
liquefied natural gas plant on the western coast to export 
all that might emerge from a prospective offshore development 
of gas near the Rakhine coast (ref B).  This shortsightedness 
was lightly papered over by an increase in production of gas 
for domestic consumption at the Nyaungdoun gas field (about 
50 miles west of Rangoon).  The field, which is being 
unsustainably overdeveloped, is producing around 80 million 
cubic feet per day (mcfd), up from about 60 mcfd a year ago. 
The increase made up for the steady decline of Burma\'s other 
major domestic gas field, A\'Pyauk (about 50 miles northwest 
of Rangoon), where production fell from 35 mcfd in mid-2003 
to around 20 mcfd in mid-2004. A western energy source told 
us that both gas fields should be tapped out within the next 
couple of years, and there are no replacements being 
considered. 
 
3. (SBU) Industry estimates of Burma\'s total natural gas 
demand (for power generation and industry) remain stable at 
around 240 mcfd.  To augment the roughly 140 mcfd the 
government takes from Nyaungdoun, A\'Pyauk, and a smattering 
of other fields, the GOB continues to purchase between 25-45 
mcfd of offshore gas from the foreign consortium that 
operates the Yadana and Yetagun offshore gas fields.  The 
vast majority of the gas from these fields (around 900 mcfd 
combined in CY 2004) is sold to Thailand under an existing 
\"take or pay\" deal with Thai energy authorities.  However, 
the GOB purchases some and diverts it northward from where 
the undersea pipeline comes onshore at Kanbauk in Tanintharyi 
Division.  This gas, except 4-5 mcfd which is sent all the 
way to Rangoon, is earmarked for a GOB cement plant in 
Myaingalay, though, so it does not impact the electricity 
situation for Rangoon much. Rangoon\'s turbines do continue to 
benefit from 8 mcfd of gas, previously being sent from 
A\'Pyauk to the plant, which is being reversed to feed 
Rangoon\'s local power generation facilities. 
 
Infrastructure Woes 
 
4. (C) This supply shortage leaves a deficit of around 50-60 
mcfd just to fuel Burma\'s anemic industrial sector and 
handful of gas/diesel-powered generating turbines.  When the 
gap is filled, which it was not very often during the dry 
season, it must be with expensive imported high-speed diesel 
from Malaysia. Curiously, despite the apparent decline in GOB 
purchases of diesel fuel, a reliable commodities trade 
watcher told us imports of diesel remained stable in FY 
2003-04 (April-March).  We suspect much of this imported fuel 
went to private generators (a necessity for all factories, 
hotels, office buildings, and those homes that can afford 
them) and trucks. 
 
5. (C) However, supply of natural gas and the GOB\'s 
willingness to import diesel are only half the problem. 
Energy sources report that infrastructure is in dire 
condition and there is little effort, or money, to fix it. 
Burma\'s pipelines are in a worrisome state and at least 2 of 
Rangoon\'s 11 gas/diesel-powered turbines are broken down. 
These infrastructure woes are compounded by 35-year old 
transmission lines (from remote hydropower plants which 
provide around 50 percent of Burma\'s electricity) that leak 
more than 40 percent of their load.  The GOB seems to be 
taking some preliminary action to address this latter 
problem, seeking aid from South Korea to replace some or all 
of the country\'s existing 132 and 230 kV transmission lines 
with new 500 kV lines. However, there is no timetable for 
this upgrade. 
 
Water Remains the Future 
 
6. (C) The GOB\'s 30-year energy plan is obsessed with 
hydropower -- upgrading existing hydropower plants and 
building a vast network of new ones -- with no contingencies 
or strategies to capitalize on natural gas or other power 
sources.  Currently, about 50 percent of Rangoon\'s 
electricity demands are met, or aren\'t met, by the aging 
Lawpita hydropower dam (built by the Japanese with war 
reparations) located east of Rangoon in Kayah State.  It 
seems unlikely with the political situation as it is that 
on-again-off-again Japanese government financing for upgrades 
to this plant will resume anytime soon.  However, with the 
help of significant and recurrent tranches of concessional 
Chinese government suppliers credit (ref B), the GOB is 
pressing ahead with a dozen hydropower projects aimed at 
adding 2000 mw to country\'s power generation capacity by 
2006. 
 
Comment: No Strategy, No Power 
 
7. (C) We don\'t see the GOB approach being successful in the 
short run.  Unpredictable onshore gas supplies could drop at 
any time, making Rangoon consumers more reliant on imported 
diesel or Godot-like hydropower.  The latter seems unlikely. 
In 2003, the GOB asserted that two plants with 480 mw 
capacity would be finished by year\'s end.  Neither was 
completed.  In 2004, the GOB is predicting that only one 
plant near Mandalay with 75 mw capacity will be completed. 
We are doubtful.  Even if it is done, though, it will likely 
have little impact on Rangoon\'s electricity woes.  Nearly all 
notable plants with a chance of completion in the next couple 
of years are located in Upper Burma, far from Rangoon, and 
aimed at electrifying Mandalay and the nearby town of Kyaukse 
-- Than Shwe\'s hometown. Fortunately, Rangoon\'s residents and 
businesses have become adept at dealing with the GOB\'s 
damaging economic policies, and small-scale private power 
generation should continue to make up for some of the slack. 
End comment.

1. (SBU) MORE OPPRESSION:  At the recent funeral of a famous 
Burmese writer (and NLD MP-elect), the Charge, a.i. met the 
wife of political prisoner Dr. Than Nyein.  Dr. Than Nyein 
was elected on the NLD ticket in 1990 from PM General Khin 
Nyunt\'s hometown of Kyauktan.  The NLD MP-elect was 
sentenced to prison in 1997 for pro-democracy activities and 
completed his seven-year sentence last month.  His wife, who 
seemed quite distraught, said that the regime has 
indefinitely extended his sentence under provision 10-A of 
the law and has refused to explain his non-release. 
 
2. (SBU) FAMILY TIES:  We understand that Dr. Than Nyein\'s 
distraught wife is General Khin Nyunt\'s first cousin. 
Further, this woman reportedly grew up in the same household 
as Khin Nyunt and served as his older sister-type figure and 
caregiver.  Dr. Than Nyein himself is PM Khin Nyunt\'s 
brother-in-law, as Madam Khin Nyunt (Khin Win Shwe) is Dr. 
Than Nyein\'s sister. 
 
3. (SBU) COMMENT: Family ties often correlate with political 
positions in Burma, especially as the military regime is 
void of any ideology apart from a cold-blooded desire to 
stay in power through repression and its shadowy network of 
patron-client relationships.  However, loyalty to the regime 
trumps almost every other connection, including, as the case 
of General Khin Nyunt demonstrates, close family ties.

SUBJECT: SUPPORT FOR BURMESE POLITICAL PRISONERS 
 
Classified By: CDA, A.I. RON MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The NLD runs a modest but very successful 
program to assist its imprisoned members.  Post is interested 
in exploring ways to bolster this NLD effort and/or find 
parallel means to help political prisoners and their 
families.  See action request para 8.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) NLD HQ ABUZZ:  The NLD national headquarters was a 
hive of activity, as is usually the case, during one of our 
many visits there earlier in August.  The ground floor of the 
decrepit two-story building was jammed with party members 
involved with HIV/AIDS awareness projects, women\'s self-help 
activities, child nutrition and care workshops, and many 
other civic programs.  At one desk two young women were 
talking to an NLD volunteer, filling out forms and answering 
questions.  We asked if we could join them; they agreed and 
we sat down to observe what was happening. 
 
3.  (C) HIGH SCHOOL REBEL:  One of the women was the sister 
of an NLD Youth League member who had been imprisoned for 
pro-democracy activities just after he graduated from high 
school.  Her brother has served four years of his six-year 
sentence, the woman explained, and had recently been 
transferred from Rangoon\'s infamous Insein Prison to another 
prison five hours north of the city.  She was at NLD HQ, she 
went on, applying for the monthly monetary support for 
imprisoned NLD members. 
 
4.  (C) AN APPLE A DAY:  The NLD volunteer explained that the 
party\'s political prisoner support committee provides up to 
2,000 kyat (about $2.50) per month to the families of 
political prisoners.  These meager funds are to enable a 
prisoner to buy \"a little cooking oil, some vegetables, or 
perhaps some fresh fruit\" from prison authorities.  The NLD 
volunteer said she processes about 60 such requests for 
assistance each week. 
 
5.  (C) ICRC HELP:  When we asked the applicant if her 
brother or her family had received assistance from any other 
source, she said no.  She did say that she was grateful to 
the ICRC, which had given her the equivalent of $15 for bus 
fare and expenses to visit her brother when he was 
transferred upcountry.  We asked the NLD volunteer if she was 
aware of any other group helping political prisoners.  She 
checked with a number of colleagues, and came back to say 
nobody knew of any other source of support for political 
prisoners. 
 
6.  (C) FUNDING TROUBLES:  According to a knowledgeable FSN, 
funding for the NLD\'s political prisoner support committee is 
a very sensitive issue.  If local Burmese are known to 
contribute to the fund, they often find themselves quickly 
arrested by the police on trumped-up, but unrelated charges. 
The NLD has a very firm policy of not accepting foreign 
assistance.  What frequently happens, the FSN continued, is 
that wealthy expatriate Burmese will send a trusted family 
member some money, with the understanding that the family 
member will quietly contribute it to the NLD fund for 
political prisoners.  We estimate that the NLD distributes a 
total of approximately $7,500 per year to political prisoners 
and/or their families. 
 
7.  (C) COMMENT:  This tiny sum probably does more to keep 
the NLD\'s flickering flame alive than many other 
pro-democracy programs costing a great deal more.  Post would 
like to discuss with various USG entities potential 
modalities or parallel programs that could support 
pro-democracy political prisoners regardless of party 
affiliation.  We would also be interested in exploring ways 
to help the families of the prisoners, if possible. 
 
8.  (C) REQUEST:  We note that that National Endowment for 
Democracy has provided up to $80,000 per year in Burma 
earmark funds in recent years to a grantee organization 
called \"The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners 
(AAPP),\" which aims to provide direct assistance to Burmese 
political prisoners and their families.  No one we have 
talked to (including the NLD and ICRC) seems to have any 
knowledge of this organization or of its activities inside 
Burma, if any.  Post would appreciate an assessment from the 
Department, USAID, or the NED of the AAPP\'s effectiveness as 
we begin to explore ways to be helpful to political prisoners 
and their families.

1. (C) Summary:  In mid-August the Burmese regime rounded up 
nine members and supporters of the National League for 
Democracy, including two MPs-elect, at several upcountry 
locations.  NLD leaders believe that the arrests are in 
retaliation for the party\'s ongoing petition drive to release 
NLD leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and U Tin Oo and to reopen NLD 
offices.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) O/a August 11, military intelligence (OCMI) agents 
arrested three NLD members and supporters in Lashio (Shan 
State) on trumped up charges of importing unlicensed 
electronic equipment from China for their local retail 
business.  The charges, under Section 51 of the Export and 
Import Control Act, carry a potential sentence of 3 to 5 
years, plus fines. 
 
3. (C) Among those rounded up in Lashio was U Than Htay, an 
NLD Member-elect of Parliament.  U Than Htay is a well-known 
lawyer who has frequently served as the NLD\'s liaison with 
ethnic minority groups in northeast Burma.  He provided ASSK 
with substantial logistical and political support for her 
ill-fated May 2003 trip through the region, which ended in an 
SPDC-instigated ambush in Sagaing Division. 
 
4. (SBU) O/a August 16, OCMI officials arrested six NLD 
members and supporters in Myaungmya (Irrawaddy Division), 
including NLD Member-elect of Parliament U Aung Kyin.  MI 
charged the group with distributing \"illegal videos\" from 
their small video rental shops.  Under Burma\'s \"Television 
and Video Law,\" the six face up to two years in prison. 
(Note: Most video shops in Burma offer bootleg copies of 
popular foreign films, which the regime considers illegal 
unless vetted by SPDC censors--a costly and cumbersome 
undertaking.  Enforcement of the law is rare, and usually a 
pretext for politically motivated harassment.  End note.) 
 
5. (C) Comment: NLD sources told Emboffs on August 24 that 
they believe the arrests are a response by the SPDC to the 
party\'s ongoing petition drive (refs A and B).  Although the 
regime has turned a blind eye to the modest petition effort 
in Rangoon, OCMI has implemented intimidating surveillance at 
upcountry signing locations and the USDA, the regime\'s 
mass-member organization, has threatened violence against 
petition organizers.  The two MPs-elect arrested in 
mid-August are both divisional NLD leaders, responsible for 
organizing local petition efforts.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: ALLEGED NORTH KOREAN INVOLVEMENT IN MISSILE 
ASSEMBLY AND UNDERGROUND FACILITY CONSTRUCTION IN BURMA 
 
Classified By: CDA, A.I. RON MCMULLEN FOR REASON 1.5 (A/C). 
 
1.  (S) SUMMARY: North Korean workers are reportedly 
assembling \"SAM missiles\" and constructing an underground 
facility at a Burmese military site in Magway Division, about 
315 miles NNW of Rangoon, according to a local embassy 
employee.  The FSN\'s source is his cousin, an army captain 
assigned to an engineering unit purportedly working near the 
alleged site.  This unsolicited account should not be taken 
as authoritative, but it tracks with other information 
garnered and reported via DAO and various other channels. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (S) A Foreign Service National employee who has worked for 
Embassy Rangoon for five years related to a group of embassy 
officers on August 26 an account of North Korean activity 
that the FSN heard the prior week from his cousin.  This 
cousin (who the FSN refused to name) is said to be an army 
captain attached to an engineering unit (designation unknown) 
based near the Irrawaddy river town of Mimbu in west-central 
Burma.  The captain, reportedly posted in the Mimbu area for 
a month or two, was recently in Rangoon, where he met with 
his FSN cousin and recounted the following.  The FSN 
described his cousin as \"proud and boastful\" of his exploits 
as an engineer, adding that the captain had been drinking 
when the FSN wheedled details from him. 
 
3. (S) According to the captain\'s account, some 300 North 
Koreans are working at a secret construction site west of 
Mimbu, Magway Division, in the foothills of the Arakan Yoma 
mountains.  (Comment: the number of North Koreans supposedly 
working at this site strikes us as improbably high.  End 
comment.)  The captain claims he has personally seen some of 
them, although he also reported they are forbidden from 
leaving the construction site and that he and other 
\"outsiders\" are prohibited from entering.  The FSN was 
confident that his cousin had the ability to distinguish 
North Koreans from others, such as Chinese, who might be 
working in the area.  The exact coordinates of the 
camouflaged site are not known, but it is reportedly in the 
vicinity of 20,00 N, 94,25 E. 
 
4. (S) The North Koreans are said to be assembling \"SAM 
missiles\" of unknown origin.  When we asked the FSN if his 
cousin specified \"SAM missiles,\" he said yes.  As the 
captain\'s reported account continues, the North Koreans, 
aided by Burmese workers, are constructing a 
concrete-reinforced underground facility that is \"500 feet 
from the top of the cave to the top of the hill above.\"  He 
added that the North Koreans are \"blowing concrete\" into the 
excavated underground facility. 
 
5. (S) The captain\'s engineering unit is supposedly engaged 
in constructing buildings for 20 Burmese army battalions that 
will be posted near the site.  Of these, two battalions are 
to be infantry; the other 18 will be \"artillery,\" according 
to this account. 
 
6. (S) After hearing this account from the FSN, emboffs asked 
why he had taken the extreme risk of engaging in such a 
conversation with his cousin.  He said that nothing the North 
Koreans were doing in Burma could be good for his country, 
and that he felt a loyalty to report this information to the 
embassy.  Emboffs thanked him for his efforts and asked him 
to be very careful, not doing anything further on this topic 
unless specifically so instructed. 
 
7. (S) COMMENT:  The FSN\'s second-hand account of North 
Korean involvement with missile assembly and military 
construction in Magway Division generally tracks with other 
information Embassy Rangoon and others have reported in 
various channels.  Again, the number 300 is much higher than 
our best estimates of North Koreans in Burma, and exactly how 
the captain allegedly came to see some of them personally 
remains unclear.  Many details provided by the captain\'s 
account, as relayed by his FSN cousin, match those provided 
by other, seemingly unrelated, sources. 
 
8. (S) COMMENT CONTINUED:  We cannot, and readers should not, 
consider this report alone to be definitive proof or evidence 
of sizable North Korean military involvement with the Burmese 
regime.  The captain\'s description made no reference at all 
to nuclear weapons or technology, or to surface-to-surface 
missiles, ballistic or otherwise.  We deem the FSN to have 
honestly and reliably related the account of his boastful 
cousin, but we have no way of knowing whether the cousin was 
honest, or was a plant or fabricator.  This account is 
perhaps best considered alongside other information of 
various origins indicating the Burmese and North Koreans are 
up to something ) something of a covert military or 
military-industrial nature.  Exactly what, and on what scale, 
remains to be determined.  Post will continue to monitor 
these developments and report as warranted.

1. (C) Summary:  According to senior GOB police officials, 
Burma has undertaken a plethora of activities in recent 
months to combat trafficking of persons.  We see ample 
evidence that the GOB continues to demonstrate a growing 
political will to combat trafficking and to improve 
cooperation with UN agencies and NGOs, especially with regard 
to the trafficking of women and children.  However, paltry 
resources, under trained staff, an inability or unwillingness 
to target corrupt and complicit officials, and indifference 
over the gravity of forced labor practices will continue to 
stymie overall progress on TIP issues.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Rangoon P/E Chief met in late August with Police 
Brigadier General Wynn Myiang, Burma\'s third-highest ranking 
police official and the country\'s lead authority on TIP 
issues, and Police Lt. Colonel Rallyan Mone, head of a new 
Anti-Trafficking Unit, to discuss ongoing efforts to combat 
trafficking in persons.  Our discussion followed a July 9 
meeting between the COM and the Minister of Home Affairs, 
during which we pressed for a more regular dialogue on TIP 
issues (ref A).  According to General Wynn Myiang, there have 
been a number of recent TIP developments: 
 
--On October 27-29 Burma will host the Coordinated Mekong 
Sub-regional Ministerial Initiative Against Trafficking 
(COMMIT), where the six countries of the region plan to 
finalize a multilateral MOU on trafficking (refs B and C). 
The UN Interagency Project on Trafficking in Women and 
Children (UNIAP) will join the GOB in co-sponsoring this 
regional TIP forum. 
 
--Burma will host a TIP workshop September 6-7 co-sponsored 
by the Asia Regional Cooperation to Prevent People 
Trafficking (ARCPPT) and UNIAP.  According to the UNODC 
resrep in Rangoon, the UNODC\'s Chief of Human Trafficking, 
Burkkard Damman, will attend \"to help move Burma\'s draft law 
on trafficking closer to promulgation.\" (Note: The Minister 
of Home Affairs says that PM Khin Nyunt has endorsed the law, 
but the GOB is going slowly in order to avoid problems that 
occurred with \"hastily\" issued money laundering legislation 
last year - ref B.  End note). 
 
-On March 30, Burma acceded to two protocols of the 2000 UN 
Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNCTOC): 
one protocol to prevent, suppress, and punish trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children; and a second protocol 
against the smuggling of migrants by land, sea, and air (a 
third protocol on arms is still \"under review\"). 
 
--The police force\'s new Anti-Trafficking Unit, set up in 
April 2004, has now established field offices in the border 
towns of Myawaddy, Tachilek, Muse, Lweje, and Kawthaung to 
\"prevent and intercept trafficking\" to Thailand and China. 
ARCPPT will complete training of 40 police officers for the 
unit by December 2004 for deployment in early 2005. 
 
3. (U) GOB officials estimate that they intercept 
approximately 1,000 trafficking victims per year.  \"However,\" 
added Rallyan Mone, \"we believe there are an additional 2,000 
undetected victims per year.\"  Since establishing a 
\"Preventative Working Committee for TIP\" in July 2002, 
authorities have arrested 795 offenders (resulting in 335 
convictions) and intercepted 2,181 victims (about half of 
whom were women).  In 2003, the only year for which there is 
full-year data, there were 377 arrests, 184 convictions 
(including two cases that resulted in life imprisonment), and 
932 victims identified.  Through July 2004, police have 
arrested 255 offenders and intercepted 706 victims.  GOB 
investigations, however, have not revealed the complicity of 
GOB officials or military personnel. \"We are unable,\" General 
Wynn Miang said, \"to identify any regional officials who may 
turn a blind eye to trafficking activities.\" 
4. (SBU) The GOB continues to cooperate with international 
organizations and NGOs to repatriate trafficking victims 
(principally women engaged in prostitution in Thailand). 
Over the past three years, these operations have included 
efforts led by Save the Children-UK (145 victims 
repatriated), World Vision (115 victims), and UNIAP (26 
victims).  In July, the Home Affairs Ministry processed 20 
women repatriated from Thailand, about half of whom appear to 
have been victims of the Burma-Thailand sex trade (Note: The 
GOB exploits many of these exercises by parading victims 
before the local press for photo-ops of GOB officials 
lecturing the young women and providing them with token 
resettlement packages.  End note.) 
5. (C) Comment:  Our meetings with GOB officials over the 
past two months lead us to conclude that our assessment in 
the latest annual TIP report remains valid (ref B):  the GOB 
continues to demonstrate a growing political will to combat 
trafficking and improve cooperation with UN agencies and 
NGOs, especially with regard to the trafficking of women and 
children.  However, paltry resources, under trained staff, an 
inability or unwillingness to target corrupt and complicit 
officials, and indifference over the gravity of forced labor 
practices will continue to stymie overall progress on TIP 
issues.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  UNHCR\'s latest assessment mission along 
Burma\'s eastern border revealed KNU strength to be 
significantly diminished and, by contrast, an alarming and 
widespread presence of DKBA soldiers \"who resemble the Hell\'s 
Angels\" in appearance, swagger, and influence.  Meanwhile, on 
the western front near the border with Bangladesh, UNHCR 
staff have discovered a \"massive increase\" in the use of 
forced labor to implement PM Khin Nyunt\'s recent instructions 
to construct a series of six bridges.  UNHCR, normally 
successful in resolving such abuses through dialogue with 
local military commanders, has hit a brick wall with the GOB 
and requests USG assistance in raising concerns with a regime 
that appears indifferent to the potential for renewed heat 
from the ILO.  End Summary. 
 
The East - Born to Be Wild 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On August 30, UNHCR representative Rajiv Kapur called 
on the Charge d\'Affaires a.i and P/E chief to update us on 
recent refugee-related developments.  UNHCR staff had just 
completed a fifth assessment trip to former conflict areas 
along the Thai border.  Kapur said that UNHCR had reached a 
very high level of trust with GOB officials and local 
military commanders, to the point that the fifth mission took 
place without official escorts or handlers and UNHCR staff 
moved about without restrictions.  The latest mission took 
place in the Kaykarek and Myawadi areas of east central Karen 
State and a planned sixth mission will visit the Papun area 
of northwest Karen State. 
 
3. (C) Kapur said it has become evident that the Karen 
National Union (KNU) insurgent movement is \"extremely 
marginal\" inside Burma.  The UNHCR missions, which have 
covered vast territory throughout remote areas of Karen and 
Mon States and Tanintharyi Division, have discovered a very 
minimal KNU presence.  In places where KNU troops are 
present, said Kapur, \"they are so stretched and so thin that 
they have no local authority,\" which, he added, could 
diminish the prospects for eventual repatriation to KNU-held 
areas.  He opined that the SPDC will nonetheless press ahead 
with peace talks as one way to further marginalize the NLD 
and the pro-democracy movement. 
 
4. (C) In contrast to the KNU, Kapur said that the Democratic 
Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA, a pro-regime splinter of the KNU) 
is \"very extensive throughout the region.\"  Kapur said the 
DKBA troops are easily recognized by their rebel appearances: 
long hair, bandannas, and automatic weapons strapped to their 
motorcycles.  They usually travel in \"gangs\" of six or seven 
and \"resemble the Hell\'s Angels\" when they barrel down remote 
roads, demanding that all traffic, including UNHCR vehicles, 
pull over to make way.  \"I don\'t know if the GOB will be 
capable of rolling them back,\" said Kapur, adding that the 
DKBA appears to be profiting handsomely from border trade 
with Thailand, as evidenced by a steady stream of 
DKBA-licensed trucks transporting consumer goods into Burma. 
 
The West - A Bridge Too Far 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Kapur also briefed us on disturbing events in Rakhine 
State along the western border with Bangladesh, where UNHCR 
provides protection and other support for repatriated 
Rohingya refugees.  UNHCR staff have for the past month 
observed a \"massive increase\" in the use of forced labor in 
the region.  Rajiv said that PM General Khin Nyunt, following 
an official visit to Bangladesh in April, had toured northern 
Rakhine State and instructed local authorities to build 
bridges to facilitate local trade and development.  Regional 
commanders subsequently implemented the PM\'s \"instructions\" 
and, according to Kapur, are building six bridges using 
forced labor \"on a major scale,\" including children. 
6. (C) Kapur said that in the past he has secured the 
cooperation of local military commanders in resolving human 
rights abuses.  However, in this most recent case the 
military is refusing to meet with UNHCR to discuss the 
problem.  Kapur raised the forced labor issue with the DFM 
Khin Maung Win, who was initially dismissive but subsequently 
responded that General Khin Nyunt had issued \"cease and 
desist\" orders to regional commanders.  However, Kapur said 
this has had no effect on overzealous authorities intent on 
completing the bridges.  Kapur has informed the Rangoon ILO 
office, but he believes that the SPDC is indifferent to the 
ILO and potential action against the regime already in the 
works for the November ILO Governing Board meeting.  Kapur 
added that Leon de Riedmatten, UN Special Envoy Razali\'s 
local liaison, has also reported that the use of forced labor 
is \"again on the rise throughout Burma.\" 
7. (C) Comment:  Kapur is a respected interlocutor who has 
done a credible job of managing some of the UN\'s most 
sensitive and critical operations in this highly politicized 
environment.  We don\'t take his reports of renewed forced 
labor lightly and will pursue further information from NGOs, 
IOs, and other Embassy sources.  Kapur also asked for USG 
assistance, suggesting that it would be helpful if we were to 
make the GOB aware of our concerns over the Rakhine situation 
(without implicating the UNHCR).  We will use forthcoming 
opportunities to address this development with appropriate 
GOB officials.  It has been a year of substantial setbacks 
for overall efforts on forced labor and if these latest 
reports are accurate, the November ILO GB will once again 
face a knotty Burma problem.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The National League for Democracy (NLD) held 
a series of recent meetings that pitted state and divisional 
party officials (younger leaders who demand a pro-active 
stance approach to the regime) against members of the NLD 
Central Executive Committee (octogenarians who are 
disinclined to stir the SPDC hornet\'s nest in the absence of 
the NLD\'s detained senior leaders).  The regime, meanwhile, 
believes that it has rendered the NLD increasingly incapable 
of mounting a serious threat, an assessment that may 
underestimate the NLD\'s capacity to remain a thorn in the 
thigh of totalitarian rule.  Nonetheless, with Aung San Suu 
Kyi (ASSK) under house arrest, most offices shuttered, and 
lessening international pressure on the Burmese regime, the 
NLD has hit an all-time low point.  The growing chorus of 
voices from among the NLD\'s younger members demanding party 
action is one indication that the status quo is creating 
considerable frustration within the pro-democracy movement. 
Summary. 
 
2. (C) From August 25-30 the NLD CEC hosted a six-day seminar 
at Rangoon headquarters with several dozen of the party\'s 
state and divisional leaders.  According to party Chairman U 
Aung Shwe, the session was a productive effort to address 
numerous party issues, but he admitted that emotions ran high 
during contentious discussions regarding potential party 
actions and demands from the ranks for leadership changes. 
 
3. (C) Seven members of the nine-member CEC (whom the SPDC 
detained after the May 2003 Depeyin attack but subsequently 
released between November 2003 and April 2004) began an 
executive meeting on September 1 to analyze and discuss the 
results of their seminar with local party leaders.  However, 
according to party sources, the CEC is not inclined to 
implement any of the recommendations put forth by the 
regional leaders while CEC members ASSK and U Tin Oo remain 
under house arrest.  Recommendations from the rank and file 
membership included the following: 
 
--Expand the Central Executive Committee:  Local leaders 
would like to see more diversity on the CEC, including women 
and youth.  However, the current CEC members say that an 
expansion is not in the party\'s by-laws and, furthermore, is 
impossible to undertake without the presence of ASSK and U 
Tin Oo (Note: the CEC has nine members and one vacancy.  U 
Kyi Maung, who passed away on August 26, resigned in 1998 
after a falling-out with ASSK and was not replaced). 
 
--Expand the Central Committee:  In theory, local NLD members 
elect the 30 members of the Central Committee (CC) who, in 
turn, appoint or elect the CEC.  In practice, top party 
leaders (ASSK, U Tin Oo, or U Aung Shwe) have hand-picked 
members of the CEC and the CC.  As with the CEC, NLD members 
would like to see more women and youth on the Central 
Committee.  However, in 1989 the then-SLORC jailed or forced 
the retirement of most CC members and the regime responded in 
similar fashion after a 1998 reorganization by arresting all 
members of the CC.  The current CEC believes that 
reinvigorating the CC now would provide no benefit to the 
party and would simply provoke the SPDC. 
 
--Convene a \"Pyi Thu Hluttaw\" (People\'s Parliament):  The NLD 
won 395 of 485 seats in the 1990 elections and party members 
have always believed that the Parliament belongs rightfully 
to the pro-democracy movement.  In 1998, the NLD formed the 
Committee to Represent the People\'s Parliament (CRPP), which 
included participants from 14 political parties.  However, 
the SPDC responded with a massive wave of arrests, forced 
resignations, and prolonged repression.  The CEC will mull 
over this recommendation, but is unlikely to take serious 
action.  The NLD, however, plans to lead efforts to 
commemorate the sixth anniversary of the CRPP on September 16. 
 
--A small, but vocal, number of NLD members apparently 
demanded that the CEC \"politicize\" an ongoing petition 
campaign to free party leaders and reopen party offices (ref 
C), press the international community to introduce the Burma 
question at the UN Security Council, and even consider moving 
the party toward an armed struggle against the military 
regime.  The CEC reportedly rejected these suggestions out of 
hand as being either impractical or against party objectives. 
 
Comment: \"We\'ve Got Them Right Where We Want Them\" 
 
4. (C) According to a foreign diplomat in Rangoon, who has 
close contacts with the SPDC\'s military intelligence, the GOB 
recently completed a classified assessment of the NLD party 
for the SPDC leadership.  The GOB analysis reportedly 
observes that the NLD has a rigid hierarchy that does not 
adhere to democratic practices within the party structure, 
has no tolerance for internal dissent, and is incapable of 
mounting a serious threat against the regime.  Such barbs 
would sting the NLD leadership, which prides itself on 
transparency, inclusiveness, and a long-term commitment to a 
peaceful transition to democracy.  However, the reported GOB 
analysis would be music to the generals\' ears, affirming that 
the SPDC has successfully implemented a campaign of 
harassment, intimidation, and repression that has rendered 
the NLD harmless. 
 
5. (C) We would maintain that the regime underestimates the 
NLD\'s reserve of support among the Burmese people and the 
capacity to remain a serious thorn in the thigh of 
totalitarian rule.  Nonetheless, it is clear that with party 
leaders in detention, offices shuttered throughout the 
country, and lessening international pressure on the Burmese 
regime (especially on the part of ASEAN and other in the 
region), the NLD has hit an all-time low point.  The growing 
chorus of voices from among the NLD\'s younger members 
demanding party action is one indication that the status quo 
is creating considerable frustration within the pro-democracy 
movement.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  Record rainfall in July and August led to 
historic flooding throughout Burma, rendering thousands 
homeless and causing severe damage to rice crops.  The 
Burmese regime denied that any flooding occurred and arrested 
individuals for distributing video footage of flooded towns. 
GOB efforts to reclaim damaged fields and replant rice will 
do little to thwart the likelihood of a decline in national 
rice production for 2004.  However, the GOB could prolong an 
ongoing rice export ban to avoid social unrest stemming from 
shortages or price increases.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Unusually heavy monsoon rains in July and August led 
to severe flooding in most low-lying areas of Burma.  The 
Irrawaddy river peaked on July 27 at 1.4 meters in Mandalay, 
the highest recorded level in 30 years, rendering thousands 
of people homeless and temporarily cutting off the Mandalay 
International airport.  Water levels in Bago Division were 
still well above the danger mark at the end of August, after 
reaching the second highest recorded level in history.  The 
Chindwin and Thanlwin rivers also rose above the danger 
level, flooding dozens of towns, submerging aquaculture 
farms, and pushing dams and reservoirs beyond capacity. 
According to NGOs and local officials, farmers lost homes, 
livestock, and acres of rice fields, as well as rice stored 
for domestic consumption. 
 
3. (C) Sources at the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation 
tell us privately that over 200,000 acres of rice may have 
been seriously damaged or lost.  Although casualties were 
minimal, local villagers report that as waters recede they 
face fouled wells, infectious diseases, and poisonous snakes 
forced into inhabited areas.  Neither the GOB nor the Myanmar 
Red Cross (MRC) have released official damage figures, but 
Embassy sources report that floods may have displaced over 
100,000 households. 
 
4. (C) The Burmese regime has reacted predictably to this 
latest natural disaster.  Several senior GOB officials denied 
to Embassy officers than any flooding had occurred or 
downplayed the impact by describing rising rivers as a 
seasonal phenomenon (\"A little water won\'t hurt anyone\" said 
one MFA official).   In late August we received credible 
reports that military intelligence had arrested several 
individuals for distributing videos of flooding in Kachin 
State. 
 
5. (U) SPDC Secretary 2, Lt. Gen Thein Sein, emerged 
mid-flooding to inspect affected areas, but official press 
coverage made no mention of damage or casualties.  Private 
journals refrained from covering the flooding for fear of 
political backlash, although one obscure health magazine 
cited the distribution of lunch packets to flood victims in 
Sagaing, providing some Burmese with the only domestic 
reports of the flooding.  The Myanmar Times, a 
government-affiliated weekly newspaper, devoted some coverage 
in late August to flooding, but minimized the damage by 
emphasizing casualties in neighboring India and Bangladesh. 
 
6. (C) UN agencies, who concede they were caught off guard by 
a cyclone that hit Rakhine State in May, tell us that they 
have been prepared for the past two months to provide 
emergency flood relief at a moment\'s notice.  However, the 
regime has declined to request foreign assistance.  The MRC 
provided evacuation assistance and privately admits that 
farmers who lost rice crops may require long-term aid. 
Additional groups that mobilized with assistance include 
Swiss Aid, the Metta Foundation (a reputable and independent 
Burmese NGO to which U.S. mission employees and FSNs have 
privately contributed funds and clothing to help flood 
victims), the Kachin Baptist Convention, World Vision, and 
the National League for Democracy.  These organizations have 
assisted with cleaning wells and procuring mosquito netting, 
sand bags, oral rehydration packets, rice, and drinking 
water. 
 
7. (C) Comment: Officially, the GOB says that efforts are 
underway to reclaim flooded farmlands and replant damaged 
rice crops.  With only two months left in the growing season, 
these efforts will do little to thwart the likelihood of a 
drastically reduced rice yield and a corresponding fall in 
national rice production for 2004.  However, due to the GOB\'s 
rice export ban (reftel), there are considerable stocks of 
rice in the hands of traders and millers (an estimated 
300,000 metric tons).  The GOB will certainly not admit to a 
fall in production and could prolong the export ban to avoid 
social unrest stemming from a shortage or an increase in 
price.  \"Creative\" exemptions to the export ban, however, 
will permit the GOB to continue to earn much-needed foreign 
exchange.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: AMERICAN CENTER ANNEX IN MANDALAY: FREQUENTLY ASKED 
QUESTIONS 
 
1.  (SBU) Given the summer-cycle turnover in personnel 
working on Burma issues, we thought it would be helpful to 
provide a quick synopsis of the plan to establish an annex 
of Rangoon\'s American Center in Mandalay.  This informal 
format provides Embassy Rangoon\'s perspective on many 
questions frequently asked by those who have not seen all of 
the exchanges on the Mandalay project over the past two 
years.  Embassy Rangoon seeks broad, active support to move 
this project ahead without delay. 
 
Q1:  DO YOU INTEND TO REOPEN CONSULATE MANDALAY? 
 
--Absolutely not.  We plan to use the former Consulate 
facility as an annex or extension of Rangoon\'s American 
Center.  Mandalay will be a platform to project our Public 
Diplomacy pro-democracy and civil society programs into 
Upper Burma, a location more accessible to Burma\'s 
politically significant ethnic minorities. 
 
Q2:  WILL FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS BE POSTED TO MANDALAY? 
 
--No American direct-hire employees, FSOs or any other 
category, will be posted in Mandalay.  Only grantees and PSA- 
Plus locally engaged staff will work there. 
 
Q3:  WHAT\'S THE STATUS OF THE MANDALAY FACILITY? 
 
--Consulate Mandalay, housed in a USG-owned property, was 
closed in 1980.  The facility was thereafter used as a USG 
guesthouse until the mid-1990s.  Contract caretakers funded 
by the State Department have protected and maintained the 
facility since. 
 
Q4:  WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITIES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN THERE? 
 
--The American Center\'s Public Diplomacy programs provide a 
unique environment for pro-democracy and civil society 
activities, a top U.S. priority in Burma.  Mandalay will 
house English teaching programs (incorporating a strong dose 
of civics, critical thinking, and participatory learning), 
cultural events featuring America\'s diversity and 
creativity, specialized professional training programs for 
pro-democracy and civil society groups, an information 
resource center providing access to American publications 
and computers, and other programs similar to those offered 
at Rangoon\'s American Center. 
 
Q5:  HOW WILL THIS BE PAID FOR? 
 
--Most of the ongoing and once-off expenses can be covered 
by the multi-million dollar Burma Earmark funds.  These ESF 
monies currently go to support pro-democracy activities 
inside and (mostly) outside of Burma.  Both Post\'s PD 
allotment and recycled funds will be used for appropriate 
start-up and recurring costs.  Last month Post recalculated 
the estimated cost of facility make-ready and security 
upgrades.  This new figure, $25,000, is well below an 
earlier estimate of $40,400.  The majority of the costs not 
covered by potential ESF, PD, Post PD allotment, or recycled 
funding would be DS expenses.  Start-up costs for 13 Local 
Guard Force members and their annual recurring expenses 
would be an estimated $85,000 and $68,000 respectively. 
(See following FAQ for other options on funding guards.) 
 
Q6:  WHAT ABOUT SECURITY CONCERNS? 
 
--Mandalay is classified as a low-threat city in the 
Security Environment Threat List and the American Center 
annex is a Public Office Facility.  This means that 
relatively modest physical security standards apply.  These 
include standard features such as solid doors, adequate 
exterior lighting, grilled first-floor windows, Mylar, and 
other moderate requirements.  Some sort of guards or 
caretakers are needed to screen visitors and vehicles. 
Whether the guards/caretakers need to be part of the 
embassy\'s Local Guard Force or could be contract guards 
hired by the grantee (and paid for by the grantee, as could 
be stipulated in a draft grant) is open to discussion. 
 
Q7:  WHY DO THIS NOW? 
 
--Burma\'s military dictatorship has in recent years 
successfully closed down or neutered most aspects of normal 
civil society.  The National League for Democracy (NLD) and 
the democratic ethnic minority parties are on the ropes. 
Mandalay can provide space to nourish and develop democratic 
leaders and organizations likely to play a key role in 
Burma\'s future.  Upper Burma is home to a wide range of pro- 
democracy political parties and is an important base of 
support for the NLD.  In Mandalay, the country\'s second 
largest city, our numerous interlocutors constantly request 
the kind of programs envisioned for this facility.  The 
building is available, the bulk of the funding is available, 
the need is great, and the longer we wait, the greater the 
chances that the dimly flickering flame of hope may be 
extinguished. 
 
Q8:  WILL THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA OBJECT? 
 
--The British recently opened a branch British Council 
library and information center in Mandalay.  They did so 
without fanfare or explicit GOB permission.  The GOB did not 
object when the American Center expanded its off-site 
Rangoon compound into a neighboring building for English 
teaching.  The GOB informally allows a large number of 
language institutes, training centers, and even schools 
(such as the USG-supported International School Yangon) to 
function, despite a formal GOB monopoly on such activities. 
 
Q9:  WHAT DOES AUNG SAN SUU KYI THINK ABOUT THIS? 
 
--Burma\'s democracy champion and Nobel Peace laureate told 
us, prior to her most recent arrest, that she supports the 
idea.  She is a co-founder of an ongoing specialized 
democracy-training program undertaken at the American Center 
in Rangoon.  She has nominated candidates for scholarships 
in our English Language training and has actively followed 
students\' progress.  She tells us that members of her party 
who live upcountry find it difficult to travel to Rangoon to 
participate in Public Diplomacy activities, given the great 
distances and limited infrastructure. 
 
Q10:  WHAT WOULD BE THE REACTION ON THE HILL FROM MEMBERS 
AND STAFFERS WHO FOLLOW BURMA ISSUES? 
 
In January 2004, Embassy Rangoon COM, PAO, and P/E Chief 
provided detailed briefings on the proposed project to 
senior Senate staff member Paul Grove and senior House staff 
members James McCormick and David Killion, and received a 
positive and encouraging response.  Subsequently, Paul Grove 
contacted the COM to advise her that he had briefed Senator 
McConnell and that the project had the \"green light\". 
 
Q11:  HOW CAN ONE HELP?  PROMPT ACTION NEEDED 
 
--Any assistance in moving this project promptly through the 
bureaucratic maze would be greatly appreciated, e.g., 
quickly clearing the Mandalay Decision Memo (that will go 
from EAP to M) and urging others to do likewise.  We seek 
immediate approval for this project with the understanding 
that Post will work closely with concerned parties on the 
implementing details.  Embassy Rangoon stands ready to 
answer any questions or provide any clarifications desired. 
We have had positive reactions to our briefings conducted 
for key Hill staffers and senior Department officials.  Post 
has encouraged visitors to go to Mandalay to inspect the 
facility; approximately twenty have done so since we first 
initiated this project in 2002. 
 
--How to best support Burma\'s beleaguered democracy 
movement?  Extra funding to decreasingly relevant exile 
political groups probably won\'t help much.  Establishing a 
platform for our effective Public Diplomacy programs in 
Mandalay will.

1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 11. 
 
2. (C) Summary:  The ILO\'s Burma representative corroborates 
UNHCR reports of a \"serious resurgence\" in forced labor in 
Rakhine State.  He adds that the GOB has dismissed all recent 
ILO interventions on forced labor and appears to be 
completely indifferent to potential countermeasures imposed 
by the international community.  We\'ve requested a meeting 
with the Minister of Labor to raise our concerns about these 
forced labor reports and alleged GOB complicity and to 
highlight potential repercussions for Burma at the November 
ILO Governing Board meeting.  End Summary. 
 
3. (C) P/E chief met on September 8 with Richard Horsey, 
liaison officer for the International Labor Organization 
(ILO), to discuss recent reports of a surge in the use of 
forced labor in Rakhine State.  Horsey not only corroborated 
the alarming reports we\'ve heard from UNHCR and others 
sources (ref A), but assessed that the forced labor situation 
near the western border \"is the most serious it has been in 
years.\" 
 
4. (C) Horsey said that the ILO first learned from 
independent sources in July that local military units in 
northern Rakhine State were rounding up villagers to rebuild 
six bridges in northern Maungdaw Township, near the border 
with Bangladesh.  Military commanders required each nearby 
village to provide 45 persons per day to work on the project; 
villages unable to contribute labor were forced to offer cash 
payments to local authorities.  The project contractor, who 
reportedly has close ties with SPDC military intelligence, 
provided small food packets or \"minuscule\" cash payments to 
some villagers, but most were uncompensated. 
 
5. (C) The ILO made a written intervention to the GOB on July 
23, documenting the reports of forced labor in Rakhine State 
and requesting action to address the problem.  Horsey noted 
that villagers forced to work on the bridges were unable to 
partake in the seasonal planting of rice, leading to food 
shortages and reduced family income.  The GOB responded in 
late August that its \"Convention 29 Implementing Committee\" 
had dispatched a field observation team to Rakhine State and 
concluded that there was no merit to the reports of forced 
labor, \"which appear to be nothing more than rumors spread by 
jealous contractors.\" 
 
6. (C) Horsey was not surprised by the GOB\'s flat denial. 
The ILO, he said, has made 35 interventions thus far this 
year to the GOB, documenting credible reports of forced labor 
throughout Burma.  The GOB has responded to roughly two 
thirds of the inquiries, ignoring the remaining third, and 
denying in every case that any forced labor existed.  In one 
egregious example, Horsey provided the GOB with a first-hand 
account of forced labor in Chin State, including photos of 
women and children working on a road project.  The GOB 
acknowledged that the project existed, but claimed that all 
work was \"mechanized\" and required no human labor whatsoever. 
 
7. (C) In early September, Horsey met with the GOB\'s 
Interagency Implementing Committee on forced labor and raised 
the Rakhine reports as well as additional forced labor 
issues, including: the arrest of two individuals after they 
had filed forced labor complaints with the ILO office in 
Rangoon; the arrest of three individuals in southern Rakhine 
State after they had written the GOB with complaints of 
forced labor; and the ongoing court case of several Burmese 
convicted of treason for having contact with the ILO (ref B). 
 Horsey said he had expected the GOB, facing a November ILO 
Governing Board meeting in Geneva, to be superficially 
cooperative or to at least take minimal efforts to stem the 
most blatant cases of forced labor.  However, Horsey said, 
\"the GOB is unconcerned about our reports and appears to be 
completely indifferent to potential ILO sanctions.\" 
Comment: The Comfort Zone 
8. (C) Forced labor and other human rights abuses in Rakhine 
State, home to a significant portion of Burma\'s repressed 
Muslim minority, are not new phenomena.  Such practices, 
condoned and encouraged by the GOB and the Burmese Armed 
Forces, were a primary factor leading to the mass exodus of 
several hundred thousand ethnic Rohingyas who fled Burma into 
Bangladesh in the early 1990s.  However, the presence of UN 
agencies and NGOs in the region, and corresponding pressure 
from the ILO since 2000, had until this year led to an 
overall decline in the use of forced labor. 
 
9. (C) Local ILO staff acknowledge that the use of forced 
labor had declined overall throughout Burma, but conclude 
that such progress does not reflect the regime\'s desire to 
stem labor abuses and was simply a result of international 
pressure and a GOB effort to forestall punitive ILO action. 
According to ILO rep Horsey, the outstanding treason court 
case, the recent resurgence of forced labor practices, and 
the GOB\'s lack of response could very likely lead the ILO in 
November to reactivate a 2000 resolution calling on ILO 
members and affiliates to review relations with Burma.  The 
ILO, he added, may also seek to invoke new and unprecedented 
measures under Article 33, such as discouraging foreign 
direct investment in Burma. 
 
10. (C) We find this resurgence in forced labor incidents, 
and the GOB\'s cavalier attitude toward the possibility of ILO 
action, a further sign that a decline in pressure from ASEAN 
and others in the region has allowed the regime to feel 
increasingly secure in its political comfort zone.  End 
Comment. 
 
11. (C) Action Request: The Chief of Mission has requested a 
meeting with Minister of Labor, Tin Winn, to express our 
concern over the reports of forced labor in Rakhine State, 
including the alleged complicity of local government and 
military authorities.  Post would appreciate, as background 
and additional talking points for this meeting, more 
information on the anticipated process at the November ILO 
meeting and potential measures directed at the GOB for its 
failure to stem forced labor practices.  We understand that 
Burma discussions in Geneva are scheduled to take place on 
November 17 or 18.  End action request.

1. (C) Summary:  A recent exchange of top military visits 
between Burma and Thailand indicates improving relations 
between the SPDC and the Royal Thai Armed Forces and is a 
sign that many wounds have healed since the two armies 
squared off during a series of deadly border skirmishes in 
mid-2002.  However, SPDC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe 
has apparently failed to respond to multiple requests from 
Thai Prime Minister Thaksin to meet in Rangoon, a likely 
indication that the regime\'s new found comfort zone with the 
Thai does not extend from the uniforms to the suits.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) On the heels of Burmese Joint Chief of Staff General 
Thura Shwe Mann\'s August 24-26 visit to Bangkok (reftel), 
Thailand\'s top military brass made recent, successive visits 
to Rangoon to meet with senior SPDC officials.  From August 
31 to September 1 Royal Thai Army Commander in Chief General 
Chaisit Shinawatra made a two-day visit to Rangoon.  Just 
over a week later, September 10-11, Supreme Commander General 
Somdhat Attanand made an almost identical high-profile visit. 
 Gen Chaisit will replace Gen Somdhat as Supreme Commander on 
October 1. 
 
3. (C) Each Thai general had substantive meetings with the 
SPDC\'s top two leaders, Senior General Than Shwe and Vice 
Senior General Maung Aye.  According to Thai Embassy 
political counselor Kallayana Vipattipumiprates, who attended 
all of the meetings, General Chaisit gave Than Shwe 
assurances that his forces would not allow insurgents to use 
Thai territory as a base \"to disrupt\" neighboring countries 
and that he was confident his successor, deputy CINC General 
Pravit Kongsuwan, would adhere to the same policy.  Although 
the two generals did not discuss ongoing talks between the 
SPDC and the Karen National Union (KNU), Than Shwe expressed 
an appreciation for the role Thai forces had played in 
\"controlling\" the border environment, observing that a more 
secure border would lead to mutually beneficial development. 
 
4. (C) According to Kallayana, General Chaisit\'s meeting with 
Maung Aye revealed interesting commentary from the Burmese 
Army chief.  Maung Aye said that \"it is time we opened our 
hearts to those who seek a peaceful and democratic\" Burma and 
he expressed the SPDC\'s desire to complete the regime\'s road 
map as soon as possible.  It had not been easy negotiating 
with the ethnic cease-fire groups, he said, but the GOB had 
achieved progress, including with the KNU.  Maung Aye 
repeated the word \"democracy\" several times, said Kallayana, 
but qualified his remarks by adding that Burma \"seeks a 
version of democracy that is acceptable to the (Burmese) 
people and to the international community,\" a process that 
\"might take longer than expected and therefore we are not 
certain about a timeline for the road map.\" 
 
5. (C) The SPDC accorded the same red-carpet treatment to 
General Somdhat Attanand\'s follow-on visit, including 
meetings with top SPDC authorities, an official dinner for 
the \"Thai goodwill delegation,\" and full coverage by 
state-run media.  SPDC Chairman Than Shwe, according to the 
Thai political counselor, told Somdhat he wanted to continue 
\"close relations\" between the Burmese and Thai militaries and 
hoped there would be no disruption after the Supreme 
Commander retires in October.  At the official dinner on 
September 10, host Vice Senior General Maung Aye joked to his 
guests about his own retirement, saying he was \"an old man,\" 
and identified JCS Shwe Mann, Secretary 1 Lt Gen Soe Win, and 
Secretary 2 Lt Gen Thein Sein as \"my replacements.\" 
 
SIPDIS 
 
6. (C) The Thai Minister of Defense is also expected to make 
a visit to Rangoon in the coming months.  However, the SPDC 
has failed to respond to several requests by Prime Minister 
Thaksin to meet with Senior General Than Shwe.  The PM has 
made at least two official requests and the Burmese have to 
date ignored the issue.  According to Kallayana, the PM is 
keen to advance a plan involving Thai support for the 
development of Dawei, a southern Burmese port city near the 
Thai border, and other bilateral issues.  The RTG, he said, 
views PM Khin Nyunt as \"hamstrung\" by the less flexible Than 
Shwe and consequently Thaksin wants to \"go to the top\" and 
deal directly with the SPDC Chairman. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  The SPDC generals take great delight in 
hosting visitors such as the Thai military leadership: the 
discussions focus on mutual border issues; their guests are 
polite and avoid raising sensitive political issues; and in 
the process the Burmese relish a perceived boost in their 
legitimacy.  However, the SPDC\'s apparent dismissal of PM 
Thaksin\'s quiet entreaties is puzzling, particularly given 
Thaksin\'s willingness to create a \"soft\" international venue 
(the \"Bangkok Process\") for the Burmese regime to pitch their 
road map.  The Thai political counselor says the RTG is 
surprised by the snub and he opines that Than Shwe is keen to 
avoid Thaksin because the SPDC suspects (\"with good reason\") 
that the Thai will raise the continued detention of Aung San 
Suu Kyi and other \"unpleasant\" political issues.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  On September 18, the SPDC conducted a 
mini-shuffle of the GOB cabinet, in the process ousting the 
regime\'s primary foreign affairs team and giving a boost to 
the trusted Minister of Labor, U Tin Winn.  Gone to pasture 
are the unimpressive Minister of Foreign Affairs, U Win Aung, 
and his capable deputy, Khin Maung Win--replaced by senior 
military officers with little or no international and 
diplomatic experience.  These latest cabinet changes are 
further indication that the Burmese regime is increasingly 
secure in its 16-year tenure.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) In a series of eight orders issued on September 18 by 
Secretary-1 Lt Gen Soe Win, the State Peace and Development 
 
SIPDIS 
Council (SPDC) made several significant changes to the 
Burmese government\'s cabinet, including the ouster of the 
Foreign Minister and his principal deputy as well as the 
Ministers of Agriculture and Transportation.  The SPDC also 
shuffled three members of the GOB cabinet to new portfolios. 
(Note: September 18 was also the 16th anniversary of the 
seizure of power by the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (SLORC), predecessor to the SPDC.  End Note.)

\"Permission granted for retirement:\"

End text of cabinet changes. 
 
4. (U) Biographic notes:  New Foreign Minister Maj-Gen Nyan 
Win, a career soldier with no known international experience, 
was until his latest appointment the Deputy Director General 
of Military Training at the Ministry of Defense.  The MFA has 
yet to release an official biography, but we understand that 
he previously served as commander of the Southeast Military 
Command (1999-2000); director of the military\'s Staff College 
(2000-2002); and as a senior member of the former Office of 
Strategic Studies (2002).  He is also an active member of the 
National Convention\'s Convening Commission, which has 
oversight of the ongoing constitutional convention. 
 
5. (SBU) Bio notes continued: Very little is known about the 
new Deputy Foreign Minister, Col. Maung Myint, current 
commander of a light infantry division based in Rangoon who 
is apparently a well-regarded military officer but speaks 
little English and has no diplomatic experience.  The new 
Minister for Cooperatives, Col Zaw Min, is the former 
Chairman of the Magwe Division Peace and Development Council, 
and the new Minister of Commerce, Brig-Gen Tin Naing Thein, 
is the former Deputy Minister for Forestry.  The outgoing 
Ministers of Agriculture (Maj-Gen Nyunt Tin) and Transport 
(Maj-Gen Hla Myint Swe) have reportedly been slated for 
retirement since 2003.  End bio notes. 
 
6. (C) Many Burmese, accustomed to the SPDC\'s quasi-annual 
cabinet reshuffling (refs), have greeted the changes with a 
resigned shrug of indifference.  However, the abrupt 
departure of the GOB\'s primary foreign affairs team is 
noteworthy for its timing as well as for its substance. 
Beginning this week, Burma goes on the defensive and faces an 
intense period of interaction with the international 
community, including the UNGA and an annual Burma resolution; 
the October Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (ASEM) and related 
diplomatic drama over Burma\'s participation; and the November 
ILO Governing Board and possible countermeasures targeting 
the military regime. 
 
7. (C) The appointment six years ago of outgoing Foreign 
Minister U Win Aung, a former military intelligence officer 
and Ambassador to the U.K., was perceived as an effort by the 
SPDC to use a capable diplomat to pitch the regime\'s bankrupt 
policies to the international community.  However, the 60 
year-old Win Aung has in many respects disappointed both the 
regime and the Rangoon diplomatic corps.  Lacking the full 
confidence of the generals, he has had scant decision-making 
authority and has frequently been uninformed about SPDC 
policies.  In private, he has expressed a desire to retire 
and spend time in a Buddhist monastery.  The \"retirement\" of 
his deputy, Khin Maung Win, marks the departure of a more 
seasoned and sophisticated career diplomat (a 1983 Fulbright 
scholar and graduate of The Johns Hopkins University). 
 
8. (C) Comment:  Following the weekend cabinet changes, there 
has been standard speculation in Rangoon that the 
appointments and departures reflect a power play among the 
regime\'s troika of Chairman Than Shwe, Vice Chairman Maung 
Aye, and Prime Minister Khin Nyunt--with the Chairman calling 
the shots and further consolidating his power.  However, we 
find it more interesting to observe that the abrupt ouster of 
the GOB\'s foreign affairs team, replaced by active military 
officers with no known diplomatic experience, is further 
indication that the Burmese regime is increasingly secure in 
its 16-year quest for legitimacy.  With these latest 
appointments, the vast majority of the cabinet is now 
comprised of active or former military officers (only the 
Ministers of Education, Health, and National Planning are 
\"full\" civilians).    End Comment.

new Foreign Minister, a recently promoted Major General with 
thirty years of operational and combat military experience, 
is a virtual unknown in local diplomatic and military

to a stint at the National Defence College in India, a

2. (SBU) Maj-Gen Nyan Win took over his new duties as Burmese 
Foreign Minister shortly after his appointment on September 
18 (reftel) and plans to embark on his first diplomatic 
mission as part of the GOB\'s UNGA delegation.  On September 
20 the SPDC appointed him alternate head of delegation and 
issued him a passport; however, his U.S. visa application 
process could delay his departure.  In the meantime, the GOB 
delegation departed this week for New York under the 
leadership of Minister of Labor U Tin Winn. 
 
3. (C) The 51 year-old Nyan Win is a virtual unknown among 
diplomatic and military circles.  According to various 
sources, he was a 1973 graduate of the Defence Service 
Academy (\"Batch 18\") and was apparently assigned to military 
intelligence during the 1980s, working closely with Khin 
Nyunt and Sanda Win (the daughter of then-dictator Ne Win, 
now under house arrest) in suppressing the 1988 pro-democracy 
uprising. 
 
4. (U) Nyan Win received several military awards and honors 
for combat experience during campaigns against ethnic 
insurgents in the 1970s and 1980s.  Although he has no known 
professional experience overseas, he attended the National 
Defence College in India, receiving a diploma in strategic 
studies in 1988 (his English language capabilities are 
unknown).  According to his official resume, he has spent the 
majority of his 30-year military career as an operational 
commander. 
 
5. (SBU) As noted reftel, Nyan Win most recently served as 
deputy Director General of military training, reporting to 
SPDC member Lt Gen Kyaw Win.  Nyan Win was promoted to Major 
General earlier this year but, according to local rumors, may 
resign from the military in order to carry out his duties as

1. (SBU) Summary: On September 21, GOB authorities detained a 
58-year old Burmese political activist for demonstrating in 
front of UNDP offices in Rangoon.  U Ohne Thant, who has 
served over 13 years in the Burmese political gulag, was 
carrying a placard calling for the United Nations to help 
implement the elections of 1990.  One of several \"solo\" 
demonstrators rounded up this year, U Ohne Thant apparently 
linked his protest to a concurrent \"long march for freedom\" 
that led Burmese dissidents from outside Albany to UN 
headquarters in New York.  End Summary 
 
2. (SBU) On September 21, Burmese Military Intelligence (MI) 
agents arrested a lone Burmese demonstrator, U Ohne Thant, in 
front of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) 
offices in Rangoon.  He was holding a placard written in 
English and Burmese calling for the United Nations to assist 
Burma in honoring the election results of 1990.  Prior to his 
arrest, U Ohne Thant had entered the UNDP compound and was 
received by the Deputy Resident Representative (DRR), who 
offered to accept and forward his materials to UNDP 
headquarters.  The DRR also advised the protester not to 
return to the street, lest he be arrested.  U Ohne Thant 
refused both suggestions and was subsequently picked up by 
MI.  Authorities are reportedly holding him for questioning 
and will likely sentence him to a minimum of seven years in 
violation of Section 5(j), Emergency Provision Act of 1950. 
 
3. (SBU) U Ohne Thant\'s solo protest may have been linked to 
a \"long march for freedom\" that Burmese activists took on 
September 21 from the Grafton Peace Pagoda north of Albany, 
New York, to UN Headquarters.  He had alerted the media to 
his plans and several locally based foreign media stringers 
witnessed the event.  He is the fourth known \"solo\" 
demonstrator to be arrested in Rangoon during the past year; 
MI has rounded up at least three in front of City Hall, 
although two of the protesters reportedly suffer from mental 
illnesses. 
 
4. (SBU) Comment: U Ohne Thant is a well-known, independent 
activist who was first arrested in 1988 for leading strikes 
in Kachin State.  Following his release in 1995, he was 
arrested again in 1997 for distributing political pamphlets 
calling for greater human rights and sentenced to seven more 
years in jail.  He was released from his second term on 
October 31, 2003.  He is popular with Burmese students and 
agitated for prison reforms while serving his earlier 
sentences.  His decision to go it alone is reportedly based 
on a desire to draw attention to human rights issues while 
minimizing the human suffering that mass protests would 
entail.  End comment

undertaking, but are essential in order to achieve a greater

to produce meaningful results inside Burma.  Nonetheless, a 
tighter international consensus would be a helpful outcome. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) COM and P/E chief met on September 21 with Leon de 
Riedmatten, Rangoon-based liaison for UN Special Envoy 
Razali.  De Riedmatten will join Razali for a round of 
Burma-related meetings in Washington and New York September 
27-October 1.  According to de Riedmatten, Razali has made 
\"six or seven\" unsuccessful requests to visit Burma since his 
March trip, but the regime has declined \"because they have 
nothing to offer and fear subsequent criticism\" should Razali 
visit and leave empty-handed. 
 
3. (C) De Riedmatten said that UNSYG Kofi Annan will chair 
consultations on Burma in New York on September 29, in a 
session \"restricted to fourteen or so countries,\" including 
the United States.  Senior UN official Danilo Turk will chair 
a larger Burma session the following day, September 30, as a 
reinvigoration of the International Consultative Group on 
Myanmar (ICGM).  Prior to the New York meetings, de 
Riedmatten said, Razali plans to consult at the Department 
with Deputy Secretary Armitage, EAP A/S Kelly, and others as 
well as officials at the NSC, although he plans to limit his 
time in Washington \"in order to avoid drawing too much 
attention to his Burma dialogue with the United States.\" 
 
4. (C) Although Burma is not invited to the UNSYG-chaired 
meeting, de Riedmatten said the session will be difficult 
because countries in the Southeast Asia region believe their 
participation \"will jeopardize relations with the regime.\" 
De Riedmatten said there were already indications that China, 
which prefers the \"safer\" Bangkok process, might decline the 
New York invitation. 
 
5. (C) De Riedmatten said that Razali would approach the New 
York meetings as a way to achieve a greater consensus on 
\"what is absolutely necessary for the (Burmese) regime to 
gain credibility\" with their road map.  He added that it 
would be important for the Western countries and the Asian 
countries to reach some agreement on how to approach the 
regime.  \"It will be helpful if the neighborhood agrees on 
the fundamentals,\" said de Riedmatten, \"which Razali can 
bring to the table with the SPDC.\"  De Riedmatten emphasized 
that, from his and Razali\'s perspective, the outcome of the 
New York meetings depends entirely on the interest and 
engagement of the international community.  \"At the moment, 
Burma is far from a top priority,\" de Riedmatten said, \"but 
we need to pull together\" on this issue. 
 
6. (C) The COM observed that the regime will never agree to 
even the most minimal steps necessary for forward movement, 
such as releasing ASSK and allowing the NLD to operate 
freely.  De Riedmatten agreed, and added that the SPDC is 
squarely focused on concluding political arrangements with 
the ethnic cease-fire groups and \"has no intention\" of giving 
space to the pro-democracy movement. 
 
7. (C) Comment: De Riedmatten has had low expectations for 
several months that the New York meeting(s) will produce 
meaningful results inside Burma (ref A).  The recent 
appointment of two active duty military officers, with 
absolutely no foreign affairs experience, as Foreign Minister 
and Deputy Foreign Minister (ref C) are additional signs of 
the regime\'s declining regard for a UN or international 
community role in helping to achieve an inclusive political 
dialogue.  However, a tighter international consensus would 
be helpful and perhaps the UNSYG\'s August 17 statement on 
Burma, criticizing the National Convention process, can 
create a framework for the New York discussions and efforts 
to define what would make a legitimate political transition.

1. (C) Summary:  Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt made a 
recent trip to Singapore--part official, part medevac--in 
what the regime views as another successful effort to garner 
ASEAN support for the SPDC\'s road map to democracy.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On September 20 the COM and P/E chief called on the 
Singaporean Ambassador to Burma, Simon Tesning de Cruz, to 
discuss Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt\'s September 12-17 
trip to Singapore.  De Cruz joined the PM\'s high-level 
delegation for the trip, which included then-Foreign Minister 
Win Aung and sundry GOB senior officials, and participated in 
all official events during the visit.  (Comment: De Cruz said 
that Win Aung, who was sacked the day after his return to 
Rangoon (reftel), was noticeably \"withdrawn and distracted\" 
during the Singapore trip.  End Comment.) 
 
3. (C) According to de Cruz, General Khin Nyunt\'s primary 
reason for visiting Singapore was to undergo \"keyhole 
surgery\" to remove gall bladder stones (Note: The Burmese 
regime\'s official press did not address the medical aspects 
of the trip.  End Note).  However, Khin Nyunt also conducted 
official business, which included bilateral meetings with 
President Nathan, Prime Minister Lee, and Senior Minister 
Goh.  PM Lee also hosted an official dinner for Khin Nyunt 
and his entourage. 
 
4. (C) General Khin Nyunt stuck to carefully crafted talking 
points, said de Cruz, delivering a rote explanation of the 
SPDC\'s road map to democracy.  The Burmese PM was upbeat, 
describing the National Convention as \"off to a good start,\" 
but acknowledged that discussions with the cease-fire ethnic 
groups were \"delicate.\"  Khin Nyunt said that Aung San Suu 
Kyi (ASSK) and the NLD had refused to attend the Convention 
(which Khin Nyunt said will reconvene in January 2005) and 
\"have been making problems ever since by discrediting the 
road map process.\"  De Cruz opined that Khin Nyunt\'s derisive 
comments about the NLD, including a threat \"to do something 
about the party\'s contact with the ethnic groups,\" were an 
ominous sign that the SPDC is prepared to crack down further 
on the pro-democracy movement. 
 
5. (C) Khin Nyunt also made a pitch for an increase in 
Singaporean investment in Burma.  According to Ambassador de 
Cruz, Minister Goh replied that Singapore would like to 
support greater economic investment, but observed that 
regional competition and a poor business climate inside Burma 
would continue to impede would-be investors.  (Note: De Cruz 
said that about only 125 Singaporean investors currently 
operate in Burma, down from about 400 four years ago, and new 
investment has dwindled to less than USD six million per 
year.  End Note.) 
 
6. (C) Ambassador de Cruz said that senior GOS officials told 
Khin Nyunt that Singapore supported the SPDC\'s road map 
process, but urged the regime to develop a timeline and to be 
more inclusive, particularly by ensuring ASSK and NLD 
participation, in order for the international community, 
especially the United States and the EU, to view the results 
as credible.  PM Lee also told Khin Nyunt that the SPDC 
needed to work with the United Nations, particularly Special 
Envoy Razali. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  The regime gave standard, high-profile 
press coverage to Khin Nyunt\'s Singapore trip, highlighting 
photos of the smiling Prime Minister with his new Singaporean 
counterpart and emphasizing the latter\'s purported comments 
that Singapore \"understands the challenges and problems\" 
Burma faces with its democratization process.  Regardless of 
what was said behind closed doors, or even in a subsequent 
GOS statement in which PM Lee noted that he had raised 
international and regional concerns about the situation in 
Burma, Khin Nyunt and the SPDC view the trip as another 
successful effort to garner ASEAN support for the regime\'s 
road map.  Embassy Singapore observes that the visit, 
characterized by the GOS as a perfunctory introductory call, 
received minimal local press coverage and the GOS, in the 
absence of any agreements or real substance, would not share 
the Burmese regime\'s more glorified view of events.  End 
Comment.

1. (C) Summary: After a few months of improved fortune for 
Burma\'s garment sector (reftel), things are turning gloomy as 
2005 nears.  Industry officials are hopeful but not 
optimistic that the troubled industry will survive the end of 
quotas in 2005.  If not, factory closures and layoffs will 
likely occur early next year, though we see little chance of 
social unrest as a result.  End summary. 
 
The End is Nigh 
 
2. (C) A top official in Burma\'s Garment Manufacturers 
Association (GMA) told us of his industry\'s increasing 
trepidation as the end of 2004, and the multi-fiber agreement 
(MFA), draw near.  He noted that some of the few foreign 
buyers remaining following the imposition of a U.S. import 
ban in August 2003 (before which the United States was the 
largest buyer of Burmese garments) were starting to shift 
their orders to China, and others were not committing to any 
new orders after November 2004.  For the official\'s own 
factories, prior to sanctions he did business with around 20 
buyers, dropping to five or six by mid-2004, and now he has 
only three or four. 
 
3. (C) Despite the increasingly gloomy scenario, the official 
claimed that neither he nor other members of the GMA were 
planning to close factories or lay off additional workers 
before the end of the year.  He said everyone was holding on 
just in case there was some dynamic that brought new orders 
to Burma.  One scenario he envisioned was that post-MFA 
Chinese producers would focus their attention on the huge 
orders coming from the United States, leaving the 
comparatively smaller European and Japanese orders to 
Southeast and South Asia. 
 
4. (C) The mood is not particularly optimistic, though.  The 
official said with certainty that he and other manufacturers 
would not wait for salvation very long into 2005.  If orders 
were not forthcoming within the first couple of months of the 
year, he said, most all manufacturers would likely cut their 
losses immediately, closing factories and firing workers en 
masse.  He noted that such sudden and large-scale lay-offs 
(he estimated around 50,000-60,000 workers still in the 
export-oriented garment sector) could cause economic and 
social problems as there was not much for these workers to 
do.  He said that no one was expecting the government to try 
and pre-empt this result or aid those who would lose their 
jobs. 
 
Comment: More Troubles 
 
5. (C) Unless there is some unforeseen twist of fate, and 
with a few exceptions, we don\'t see the industry surviving 
far into 2005.  However, we also don\'t see any serious social 
consequences from the likely fallout of the industry\'s 
collapse.  We saw no unrest when tens of thousands lost their 
jobs in the garment factories in the months following the 
imposition of the import ban.  Also, despite genuine concern 
from local INGOs, there is thus far little evidence that a 
notable percentage of those who lost their jobs has turned to 
sex work or illegal migration.  End summary.

1. (C) Summary: Though the Burmese government is taking steps 
to combat transnational trafficking in persons, it\'s becoming 
increasingly evident that the GOB is approaching domestic 
trafficking -- including forced labor -- from a different, 
less vigilant, angle. End summary. 
 
Anti-TIPs Unit, Not Anti-Forced Labor Unit 
 
2. (C) Police Brigadier General Wynn Myaing, Burma\'s top cop 
for anti-trafficking and transnational crimes, told us on 
September 27th that the Labor Ministry, not the Home Affairs 
Ministry, would retain jurisdiction over violations of 
Burma\'s forced labor laws.  Likewise he noted that domestic 
prostitution would remain under the jurisdiction of the 
regular police force, not the anti-trafficking unit.  He did 
claim, though, that the newly formed specialized unit would 
get involved if there were suspicions of trafficking involved 
in any prostitution cases.  It is unclear, though, who would 
make this judgment. 
 
3. (C) This refinement of the BG\'s previous comments to us 
(ref B) is further evidence of a growing divergence in the 
GOB\'s policies toward the interlocked issues of forced labor 
and other types of trafficking in persons.    While there has 
been significant progress in the GOB\'s attitude toward 
transnational trafficking, UNHCR and ILO officials in Rangoon 
tell us that in recent months there has been a sharp uptick 
in forced labor incidents -- especially in Rakhine State (ref 
A).  Furthermore, as the ILO has repeatedly noted, the GOB 
continues to refuse to enforce its own laws on forced labor. 
 
Comment: Split Personalities 
 
4. (C) Though the BG insisted that the GOB would adhere to 
the UN definition of trafficking and that his officers would 
be vigilant against all trafficking cases (domestic or 
transnational), there is no disputing that initial 
circumstantial evidence is pointing toward an emphasis on 
those trafficked across international borders.  Beside the 
issue of jurisdiction for forced labor and prostitution, the 
new anti-trafficking unit will come under the command of a 
new Department of Transnational Crime at the Ministry of Home 
Affairs.  Likewise, the new unit will have its tactical 
commands along the Chinese and Thai borders, with only 
logistical operations in Rangoon and Mandalay (both major 
sources and destinations for trafficked persons).  End 
comment.

1. (C) Summary:  On September 29, the NLD CEC suspended three 
local level party leaders following an \"unauthorized\" quiet 
march in support of several standard NLD policy positions. 
One senior NLD advisor told us that that the CEC, including 
ASSK, believes \"party discipline must be enforced--otherwise 
the movement risks falling into chaos.\"  Regretfully, the 
party\'s public display of internal fissures signals to the 
regime that the SPDC\'s pressure tactics, aimed at squeezing 
the NLD and rendering the democracy movement ineffective, are 
showing results.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On September 27 several dozen members of the National 
League for Democracy (NLD) undertook a quiet march from party 
headquarters to nearby UNDP offices to deliver a letter 
calling for U.N. recognition of the results of the 1990 
elections, help in freeing Aung San Suu Kyi and political 
prisoners, and other NLD positions.  The march took place 
following an NLD commemoration of the pro-democracy party\'s 
16th anniversary. 
 
3. (SBU) However, NLD leaders on September 29 suspended at 
least three women members of the party for their role in 
organizing the \"unauthorized\" demonstration.  According to 
senior party sources, the NLD Central Executive Committee 
(CEC) was unaware of the march and did not direct the action. 
 CEC members were displeased by wire reports covering the 
event, which characterized the contents of the letter as 
official NLD policy.  In addition to addressing ASSK\'s 
detention and the 1990 elections, the letter reportedly 
called for the convening of a \"People\'s Parliament,\" an 
action previously advanced by the NLD that provoked the SPDC 
and led to intense repression and harassment of Members-elect 
of Parliament and other activists. 
 
4. (C) One senior NLD advisor told us on October 2 that the 
decision to suspend the three women, local level party 
leaders from Rangoon and Magwe, was \"made by all nine members 
of the CEC,\" signifying that ASSK and Vice Chairman U Tin Oo, 
also under house arrest, used back channels to weigh in on 
the issue.  \"The NLD is in a precarious situation,\" said the 
senior advisor, \"and the CEC believes that strict party 
discipline must be enforced--otherwise the movement risks 
falling into chaos.\" 
 
5. (C) Comment:  The NLD, believed by many observers to be at 
its most beleaguered position in years, is clearly suffering 
the strains of regime pressure.  The prolonged detention of 
the party\'s two key leaders (16 months and counting), the 
complete shutdown of all party activities outside of Rangoon, 
and an increase in arbitrary arrests and harassment (ref B) 
is taking its toll.  As we have noted recently, the status 
quo is creating considerable frustration within the party, 
where a growing chorus of rank and file voices are demanding 
party action (ref A).  Regretfully, the recent party 
suspensions are an airing of dirty laundry that signal to the 
regime that the SPDC\'s pressure tactics, aimed at squeezing 
the NLD and rendering the democracy movement ineffective, are 
showing results.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  New Foreign Minister U Nyan Win met with the 
COM on October 5, only his third encounter as FM with a 
diplomat in Rangoon.  By all appearances, Nyan Win is a 
caretaker foreign minister under instructions from SPDC 
Chairman Than Shwe to hold the regime line.  He declared that 
the GOB has no intention of changing its foreign policy, 
reiterating standard SPDC arguments that Burma is 
misunderstood and that ASSK and the NLD are destabilizing 
elements.  His message is entirely consistent with the SPDC\'s 
determined march to complete its road map with a regional 
stamp of approval, marginalize the democratic opposition, 
consolidate full control over Burmese territory, and prolong 
its staying power.  We can expect some cooperation on several 
apolitical bilateral issues, but we have no expectation that 
the new FM will be responsive on other important policy 
issues.   End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On October 5, the COM called on Burma\'s new Foreign 
Minister, U Nyan Win.  The FM, one of only a few cabinet 
members to meet with U.S. Embassy officers since new 
sanctions were imposed in July 2003, was joined by new Deputy 
Foreign Minister U Maung Myint, Deputy DG Phae Thann Oo, and 
new Americas Division Director U Paw Lwin Sein.  The DCM and 
P/E chief (notetaker) also participated. 
 
3. (SBU) FM Nyun Win\'s meeting with the COM was only his 
third meeting with a diplomatic envoy in Rangoon since 
assuming duties on September 18.  Nyun Win has met with the 
Japanese Ambassador-designate and, on October 5, with the 
visiting Indian Foreign Secretary.  Following his meeting 
with the COM, the Foreign Minister was scheduled to meet with 
the Singaporean Ambassador, dean of the diplomatic corps. 
The new FM joined the GOB delegation to the UNGA last week 
(and he expressed to the COM gratitude for his last minute 
visa), where he said he had the opportunity to meet UNSYG 
Koffi Annan and \"explain\" the Burma situation. 
 
4. (C) Nyun Win--demonstrating minimal though better than 
expected English language skills--said that he has long been 
aware of the United States as a superpower and he therefore 
desired closer cooperation.  However, he added, the GOB has 
no intention of changing its foreign policy.  \"If the U.S. 
participates with us,\" he said, \"we will reach our goals 
quickly.\"  Offering a familiar SPDC argument, he said that 
Western countries misunderstand Burma and impose sanctions 
that only inflict suffering upon the Burmese people.  \"You 
(the Embassy) are in a better position than your Congress to 
understand our situation and to explain to Americans that our 
points of view are not all that different.\" 
 
5. (SBU) The Foreign Minister also criticized the NLD, 
positing that the West had pressured the GOB to allow NLD 
participation in the National Convention (NC), but the 
opposition party then proceeded to boycott and \"destabilize 
the road map process.\"  The GOB, he said, had freed ASSK in 
the past only to watch her force confrontation and refuse to 
participate in nation building.  \"Why don\'t you push ASSK and 
the NLD like you push us?\" he asked.  Nyun Win also 
complained that the international media portrays an 
inaccurate view of Burma.  The COM quickly retorted that the 
GOB needed to allow journalists to enter the country.  \"You 
might not like everything that gets written,\" she said, \"but 
access to information is important not only for the outside 
world, but for the Burmese people as well.\" 
 
6. (SBU) The COM stated that the GOB\'s road map would lack 
any credibility whatsoever unless authorities release senior 
NLD leaders and establish a fixed timeline.  \"If the GOB is 
sincere about an inclusive process,\" she said, \"then how can 
you expect the NLD to participate while their leaders 
languish in detention?\"  The COM forcefully pointed out that 
immediate freedom for ASSK and U Tin Oo was a basic human 
right and reminded the FM that ASSK was the victim of a 
premeditated assault on May 30, 2003--not the aggressor, as 
the GOB has frequently attempted to portray her and the NLD. 
 
7. (SBU) The U.S. will not change its Burma policy unless the 
GOB undertakes serious measures to achieve national 
reconciliation, was the message the COM exhorted the FM to 
deliver to the SPDC.  The issue is not just bilateral, she 
added, and pointed to EU sanctions and the UNSYG\'s August 
statement criticizing the NC as examples of international 
concern.  The COM urged Nyun Win to speak with SPDC Chairman 
Than Shwe about allowing the immediate return of the UNSYG\'s 
Special Envoy and the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights. 
(Note:  The COM provided the FM with a copy of the 
Department\'s October 4 statement on the UNSYG\'s September 29 
Burma meeting.  End Note.) 
 
8. (C) Bio notes:  Both Nyun Win and his deputy, Maung Myint, 
were dressed in traditional Burmese civilian clothing, 
backing reports that they have doffed their military uniforms 
and taken sabbatical from active duty.  DFM Maung Myint made 
no contributions during the 30-minute meeting and appeared to 
have minimal or no English language comprehension.  The new 
DFM, according to his junior colleagues, will be in charge 
only of administrative matters while a second Deputy Foreign 
Minister, the unimpressive Kyaw Thu, will assume the role of 
\"senior DFM\" responsible for most policy matters. 
 
Comment: Caretaker Foreign Minister 
 
9. (C) By all appearances, Nyan Win is a caretaker foreign 
minister under instructions from SPDC Chairman Than Shwe to 
hold the regime line.  Since the September 18 ouster of the 
GOB\'s experienced former foreign affairs team (ref B), the 
long-time diplomat U Tin Winn, Minister of Labor and 
concurrently a Minister in the Prime Minister\'s Office (and 
former Ambassador to the U.S.), has carried the regime\'s 
water to the international community, including in his role 
as head of delegation to the UNGA and as senior GOB 
representative at the imminent ASEM Summit in Vietnam. 
 
11. (C) We were not surprised by FM Nyan Win\'s narrow views 
or his message that the GOB has no intention of changing its 
foreign policy.  His approach is entirely consistent with the 
SPDC\'s determined march to complete the road map with a 
regional stamp of approval, marginalize the democratic 
opposition, consolidate full control over Burmese territory, 
and prolong its staying power.  The COM also pressed for 
appropriate cooperation on our joint opium yield survey, 
humanitarian remains recovery operations, and the 
construction of a new embassy compound.  We can expect some 
cooperation on these efforts, but have no expectation that 
the new FM will be responsive on other important policy 
issues.  End Comment.

GOB remaining in the business long, though we cannot predict

The Old Bait and Switch and Bait 
 
2. (C) The GOB\'s rice export \"policy\" continues to drift. 
Though the government\'s \"temporary\" ban on the export of rice 
continues into its tenth month, there are signs that the 
embargo is beginning to crack.  However, this has been no 
boon for jilted private exporters as the initial hushed 
contracts have benefited the old agricultural commodity 
monopoly: Myanmar Agricultural Products Trading (MAPT). 
According to a knowledgeable commodities trader, MAPT has 
been tasked with providing the 130,000 tons of rice the GOB 
has sold in recent months (though only 23,000 tons have been 
shipped to date, with another 30,000-40,000 tons expected to 
ship before the end of CY 2004). 
 
3. (C) It\'s unlikely that this new arrangement will last. 
According to the source, MAPT has been quietly brought off 
the bench to sell off the GOB\'s warehoused stock that is 
becoming valueless with age.  Ironically, poor record keeping 
and years of corruption by state warehouse managers, who sold 
rice out the back door, have left MAPT about 65,000 tons 
short of the amount contracted.  This amount will have to be 
made up from the private sector, as government 
forced-procurement of rice from farmers ended this year. 
 
4. (C) Another piece of evidence that the government\'s 
re-entry into rice is short-term is the GOB\'s clear intent to 
dissolve the state\'s agribusiness entities.  Since the March 
2003 decision to open the rice market, MAPT staff has been 
cut from 14,000 to 3,000 employees (not enough to run a 
massive procurement, storage, and export operation). 
Additionally, the Ministry of Agriculture\'s export promotion 
and agricultural research and education arm, the Myanmar 
Agriculture Service, is reportedly being downgraded from a 
state-owned enterprise to a department within the ministry. 
 
5. (C) The GOB\'s move to eliminate its role in rice exporting 
does not necessarily signal an imminent return of the private 
sector.  The initial justification for the export ban was 
fear of rising rice prices and a weak grasp on nationwide 
production and demand statistics.  The latter problems have 
not been touched, and recent flooding in agricultural areas 
(plus a huge spate of buying earlier this year by the 
military, see reftel) have been nudging up prices.  However, 
there is some good news.  The government in August lifted the 
ban, also in place since January, on exports of corn and 
reliable sources tell us the senior SPDC leadership will 
revisit the question of private sector rice exports in 
December. 
 
Comment: Believe it When You See it 
 
6. (C) The result of this expected policy review is 
impossible to predict, but we see three possible outcomes. 
First, the SPDC could allow the private sector to resume its 
pre-January operations freely buying and selling within the 
new system.  Second, the SPDC could re-open partially the 
rice market, allowing such military-controlled \"private\" 
firms like Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd. to take the lead. 
Finally, the SPDC could decide the situation is still too 
fragile to allow the market to prevail, and keep things at 
the politically safe status quo -- with the attendant damage 
to farmers, exporters, and foreign exchange reserves. End 
comment.

SUBJECT: AUNG SAN SUU KYI THANKS AMERICA FOR ITS SUPPORT, 
SEEKS ASSISTANCE FOR NLD-RUN SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS 
 
Classified By: CHIEF OF MISSION CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASON 1.4 (B/D) 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  Aung San Suu Kyi sent a verbal message via a 
trusted Burmese confidante to us October 8 to:  A) thank the 
U.S. for its continued strong support of democracy in Burma, 
B) warn that \"some in the UN system are seeking to undermine 
America,s efforts in Burma,\" and C) seek USG support for 
NLD-sponsored social welfare programs.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Emboff met a Burmese confidante of Aung San Suu Kyi on 
October 8.  This source, one of three or four people who can 
enter and leave ASSK\'s housing compound regularly, requested 
the meeting.  He stated that Aung San Suu Kyi had provided 
him with a very specific message to pass verbally, noting 
that for security reasons she preferred not to send a written 
note at this time. 
 
3. (C) First, Aung San Suu Kyi sent her profound thanks for 
the staunch support by the American government and people for 
the cause of democracy in Burma, the contact said.  Aung San 
Suu Kyi said that the U.S. has shown itself to be a true and 
close friend of Burma, he added. 
 
4. (C) Second, ASSK sent a warning, not further amplified, 
that she has learned that some officials in the United Nation 
system are working against U.S. objectives in Burma.  (For 
potential context, see sensitive reporting in other channels.) 
 
5. (C) Third, she asked for USG support for NLD social 
welfare programs.  She specified four types of programs for 
which she sought U.S. support:  pencils and notebooks for 
students, medicines, support for the elderly, and continued 
support for the Embassy-run Professional Development Program 
(PDP) aimed at building next-generation leadership potential 
among NLD officials.  The contact also mentioned support for 
the families of political prisoners. 
 
6. (C) Since the NLD as a party is forbidden from receiving 
outside assistance under Burmese law and refuses to do so on 
principle, we discussed potential delivery mechanisms should 
support for ASSK\'s suggested programs be forthcoming.  One 
idea posited was that ASSK might nominate non-NLD individuals 
as cutouts to receive assistance and funnel it on to the NLD. 
 (Note:  This approach has been used successfully in the 
recent past.  End Note.)  The contact said he,d discuss this 
in detail with Aung San Suu Kyi at the earliest opportunity 
and get back to us.  We added that some sort of handwritten 
request, even if not addressed directly to us for security,s 
sake, would be desirable prior to the start of any such 
assistance. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT:  ASSK,s verbal message was likely in 
response to at least three queries we have stealthily 
delivered to her in recent months seeking her views on ways 
the USG might assist the pro-democracy movement.  We were a 
bit surprised by her comments on PDP, as the initial batch of 
NLD trainees she nominated has completed its course of study 
and we are still waiting for an NLD response to our repeated 
inquiries regarding a potential second batch of participants. 
 Aung San Suu Kyi knows that the NLD, which is at very low 
ebb, needs to provide something positive to its members and 
supporters - if not democracy and a better life immediately, 
then at least pencils and paper for their children and 
perhaps some medicine for the ill.  This is the first direct 
message we have received from her since April.  End Comment.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: An apparent up-country attack by the Burmese 
army\'s regular forces on a once untouchable interagency unit 
including military intelligence officers has led to 
speculation that long-simmering hatred between MI and the 
regular troops has begun to heat up.  The incident is quite 
extraordinary, but we are not quite ready to attach major 
political significance to what could turn out to be an 
isolated incident. End summary. 
 
The Shot Heard \'Round Muse 
 
2. (C) We\'ve heard from a number of reliable sources about an 
unprecedented attack in mid-September by elements of a 
regional military command on a unit of NaSaKa officers at a 
checkpoint near the Burma-China border at Muse.  The soldiers 
surrounded the NaSaKa unit, roughed them up, and arrested its 
leadership.  NaSaKa is an interagency group including 
Customs, Immigration, and Military Intelligence (MI) that 
operates, often corruptly and with impunity, in the border 
regions.  According to an active China border trader, this 
particular unit controlled the Pang Hpak Man checkpoint just 
south of Muse and was notorious for its corruption, 
smuggling, and ruthless treatment of competing smugglers. 
 
3. (C) Because of MI\'s control of information and its secret 
files on all military officials, members of regional commands 
are traditionally reluctant to take action against their MI 
colleagues no matter the offense.  This status quo has 
apparently been approved at the highest levels -- where Prime 
Minister General Khin Nyunt commands MI and SPDC #2 Vice 
Senior General Maung Aye controls the regional military 
commands.  No one with whom we spoke about this incident 
could remember another such attack occurring. 
 
4. (C) The trigger for this action is not exactly clear. 
There are rumors that this NaSaKa unit had knowingly 
intercepted convoys carrying smuggled goods for very senior 
VIPs in Rangoon.  Other rumors claimed that the unit had 
brutally killed a young Kachin smuggler who turned out to be 
a relative of a senior official of one of the Kachin 
cease-fire groups in Myitkyina.  In either event, our sources 
reported that the local military commander complained to 
Rangoon about the actions of this NaSaKa unit.  The word came 
down from the highest level, then, that action should be 
taken. 
 
Comment: Nevermind Why 
 
5. (C) Most of our sources insist that this move has 
political significance as an attack by Maung Aye and Than 
Shwe (representing the regional commands) against Khin Nyunt 
(representing MI and NaSaKa).  Indeed such an attack is 
apparently unprecedented and would certainly require 
authorization from the very top of the SPDC.  However, we 
haven\'t seen enough evidence to convince us this is the first 
blow in a long-predicted open power struggle between the 
military and MI.  It could just be punishment of a previously 
untouchable group of officials who went one step too far. 
Further attacks along these lines, or any acts of \"revenge\" 
by NaSaKa or MI, could add credence to the theory that turf 
battles among the \"Big Three\" are escalating.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA TO HOST MAJOR REGIONAL TIPS CONFERENCE 
 
REF: A. RANGOON 1301 
     B. RANGOON 1132 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The Burmese Government, with support from 
the United Nations, is preparing to host a three-day regional 
conference on trafficking in persons, October 27-29.  This is 
a safe issue for the generals.  It provides an easy platform 
on which to interact with their neighbors and to improve 
their international image.  There are few signs, however, 
that they will be able to control fully either domestic or 
international trafficking in Burma in the near future.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) The Governments of Burma, Cambodia, China, Laos, 
Thailand, and Vietnam plan to meet at the ministerial level 
in Rangoon on October 29 to sign a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) committing their governments to cooperate 
against trafficking in persons (TIPs).  Staff work and 
substantive coordination are being provided by the United 
Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking in the 
Greater Mekong Sub-Region (UNIAP), a Bangkok-based 
organization located in the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP) with offices in each of the participating 
countries. 
 
3. (U)  The objectives of the MOU are to facilitate 
inter-governmental cooperation among the participants in all 
areas of trafficking, including repatriation and labor.  The 
agreement also aims to strengthen bilateral agreements 
reached earlier on related issues between Thailand-Cambodia 
(2003) and Thailand-Laos (2004).  Understandings reached 
previously between Thai and Burmese authorities served as the 
basis for the repatriation of twenty Burmese girls from Mai 
Sai to Tachileik on August 10.  Six Burmese girls were handed 
over by Thai authorities to Burmese Embassy officials in 
Bangkok and repatriated in December 2003.  The MOU aims to 
extend such bilateral cooperation through both additional 
formal agreements on specific issues of particular interest 
to the participating governments and informal understandings 
on problems as they occur. 
 
4. (U)  In addition to the foregoing, UNIAP\'s acting 
director, Susu Thathoun (Burmese), told poloff recently that 
the MOU signing will be preceded by two days of talks among 
senior officers of the participating governments, October 
27-28, aimed at developing an \"action plan\" to support the 
MOU\'s objectives.  A follow-on senior officers\' meeting is 
scheduled for Hanoi in March 2005 to review and refine the 
plan.  Plans for a subsequent ministerial level meeting in 
China are underway. 
 
Background--A Big Tent Over the MOU 
 
5. (U)  UNIAP was formed in 2000 and now brings together, 
according to Susu Thathoun, \"six governments, twelve U.N. 
agencies, eight international NGOs, and a wide variety of 
local partners in the anti-trafficking community.\"  She said 
the Chinese government has played an important role in the 
formative process, and was instrumental in launching the MOU. 
 
6. (U)  UNIAP draws help from faith-based organizations, 
INGOs, U.N. agencies, and the Australian Government.  World 
Vision, with support from the Department, has been an 
important player in Burma.  Through an Australian Aid 
project, \"Asia Regional Cooperation to Prevent People 
Trafficking,\"  Australian police officers are training 
counterparts in anti-trafficking units in Burma (ref A), 
Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, all of whom are expected to be 
involved in supporting the MOU. 
 
7. (SBU)  Susu Thathoun cited the drafting in September of a 
Burmese law against trafficking as a major breakthrough in 
the international community\'s relationship on trafficking 
issues with the Burmese regime.  After some urging, the 
latter agreed to allow open discussion about the new law 
among all concerned--Burmese and foreigners--during the 
drafting process.  Accepting this arrangement had not been 
\"intuitive\" among the generals and other government 
officials, who nevertheless recognized the value of doing so 
in the end.  The draft law is now under inter-agency review 
and is expected to be approved by the SPDC in December 2004. 
Susu Thathoun spoke very highly of the work done on the law 
by Burkhard Damon, an official with the United Nations Office 
of Drug and Crime Control (UNODC) in Vienna. 
 
8. (SBU)  Comment: We are encouraged by the procedural gains 
described above (and we are also impressed with UNIAP\'s Susu 
Thathoun, a Burmese citizen with Mon-Arakanese antecedents 
and a Ph.d from a Japanese university).  However, the 
impediments to effective control of trafficking of persons in 
Burma are great.  No one in the 40-man police 
anti-trafficking unit (currently co-located with their 
Australian trainers in a house on the outskirts of Rangoon) 
has been deployed to the field.  Agreement has apparently yet 
to be reached on whether to assign them to existing field 
units or to base them in Rangoon and deploy them on specific 
investigative assignments.  Also, as reported previously (Ref 
A), they are to work solely on international trafficking 
cases. Domestic abuses will be handled by others.  Further, 
according to the deputy head of the Australian training unit 
(John Rennie), police procedures related to trafficking are 
highly antiquated, with related laws dating to the 19th 
century.

1.(C) Summary: Rangoon is abuzz on October 19 with rumors 
that a Burmese regime internal power struggle, pitting Prime 
Minister General Khin Nyunt\'s Military Intelligence (MI) 
against the regular military led by Senior General Than Shwe 
and Vice Senior General Maung Aye, may have resulted in 
significant changes within the ruling junta.  According to a 
senior diplomatic contact with excellent GOB access, PM Khin 
Nyunt \"is no longer in his position.\"  Reports are credible 
that tensions within the SPDC are serious and competing 
economic interests and/or corruption may be at the root of 
current internal struggles. 
 
2. (C) As of COB, the streets and sidewalks of Rangoon 
bustled with a normal amount of activity and there appears to 
be no immediate danger to AmCits or Embassy personnel.  We\'ve 
seen several truckloads of troops being mustered in downtown 
Rangoon (a fairly common sight) and have heard of one 
regiment being moved into the capital from an outlying area. 
According to a variety of sources, numerous senior MI 
officers have been taken in for questioning, and police and 
military units have been placed on standby alert.  Khin 
Nyunt\'s whereabouts are currently unknown and his office 
shelved a meeting scheduled for October 19 with the dean of 
the diplomatic corps.  His abrupt ouster or detention would 
be significant, although we would not expect an immediate 
change in current SPDC policies that are aimed at 
consolidating power, achieving national unity, suppressing 
the democratic opposition, and bolstering legitimacy through 
regional support.  End Summary. 
 
The Army versus MI? 
------------------- 
 
3. (C) The long-simmering economic rivalry (refs) between MI 
and the rest of the military apparently came to a head 
October 18 and 19 in Rangoon with numerous senior MI officers 
reportedly being arrested, detained, and/or taken in for 
questioning by regular army troops.  Some relatively light 
troop deployments around Rangoon are about the only outward 
indication of anything amiss, although such movements are 
quite common in the capital and elsewhere in Burma.  We have 
heard no reports of violence associated with the rumored 
detentions or of any threat to AmCits or U.S. Embassy 
personnel. 
 
4. (C) According to Embassy sources, soldiers and police have 
been placed on stand-by alert and we observed six or eight 
truckloads of soldiers gathering at a muster point in 
downtown Rangoon.  According to a reliable diplomatic source, 
one regiment of troops has been brought into the capital from 
a base just north of Rangoon.  Some contacts tell us that 
cell phone usage was cut for a little over an hour on the 
evening of October 18, but we cannot independently verify 
that. 
 
5. (C) Some government offices, including the Ministry of 
Home Affairs which oversees the Burmese Police, canceled 
routine meetings scheduled with diplomats on October 19. 
However, the Rangoon international airport, official media, 
and commercial sector all functioned normally.  Throughout 
the day, Rangoon bustled with a routine amount of activity, 
including markets, schools, offices, public transportation, 
and rush hour commuting. 
 
PM Khin Nyunt,s Fate? 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) Well-placed sources variously claim that Prime 
Minister Khin Nyunt has been detained for questioning, placed 
under house arrest, sacked, and/or outright arrested.  On 
October 18, the Prime Minister reportedly made an official 
trip to and from Mandalay (Burma\'s second largest city) and 
was detained or questioned upon his return in the evening. 
According to a senior diplomatic contact with excellent GOB 
access, the Prime Minister \"is no longer in his position.\" 
7. (C) Khin Nyunt\'s office postponed a meeting previously 
scheduled for the early evening of October 19 with the dean 
of the diplomatic corps (the Singaporean Ambassador, who 
noted that the PM\'s office was \"ambiguous\" when advising him 
of the postponement).  As of COB October 19, the Prime 
Minister\'s actual whereabouts are unknown.  Of note, however, 
Khin Nyunt and other senior SPDC members are rarely seen 
about town, other than via daily official media coverage of 
SPDC meetings, inspections, and \"delivering of instructions\" 
to subordinate troops or government entities. 
 
Comment:  Opaque and Murky 
-------------------------- 
8. (C) There are no immediate signs (as of COB Tuesday, 
Rangoon time) that a \"coup\" has taken place.  By all accounts 
and appearances, the Burmese military junta, the State Peace 
and Development Council (SPDC), remains firmly in control and 
under the continued leadership of Senior General Than Shwe 
and Vice Senior General Maung Aye.  Developments within the 
13-member SPDC, however, are typically more opaque.  We have 
no reason to doubt that recent tensions within the military 
(reftels) may have, over the past 36 hours, led to the 
detention and/or interrogation of senior military officials, 
a possible shuffle within the SPDC itself, or even the arrest 
and/or ouster of council members. 
 
9. (C) The preponderance of information suggests that PM Khin 
Nyunt is either detained or out of a job, although we cannot 
verify this with full certainty.  Khin Nyunt, an original 
member of the military junta that seized power in 1988, is 
the SPDC\'s third highest-ranking official and the regime\'s 
primary liaison with the country\'s 17 cease-fire groups as 
well as with important international partners such as China. 
His abrupt ouster or detention would be significant, although 
we would not expect an immediate change in current SPDC 
policies that are aimed at consolidating power, achieving 
national unity, suppressing the democratic opposition, and 
bolstering legitimacy through regional support.  The 
situation may remain murky for the foreseeable future. 
Further clarification could come from the SPDC itself in the 
form of an official statement, a public appearance by Khin 
Nyunt, or the undertaking of planned SPDC activities, such as 
the anticipated travel to India of SPDC Chairman Than Shwe 
o/a October 24.  End Comment.

1. (SBU) The Burmese Supreme Court Special Appellate Bench 
ruled on October 14 not to throw out the high treason and 
conspiracy convictions against three individuals for, among 
other things, having in their possession business cards of 
the ILO representative in Burma.  The three had initially 
been sentenced to death in November 2003 with the sentences 
reduced in May to life (for one who was also convicted of 
plotting to kill SPDC leaders) and 3 years (for the two 
others).  The October 14 decision reduces the life sentence 
of Shwe Man to 5 years and the 3 year sentences of Naing Min 
Kyi and Aye Min to 2 years. 
 
Comment: A Turning Point? 
 
2. (C) The court decision (undoubtedly dictated by senior 
SPDC members) is very disappointing though not unexpected and 
could have serious ramifications at November\'s ILO Governing 
Board Meeting.  The local ILO representative for Burma was 
watching this case very carefully, and had expressed to us in 
the past the importance of the appeals court vacating the 
initial convictions and making it very clear that it was not 
illegal to contact the ILO (a point we have emphasized with 
the GOB, including the Minister of Home Affairs; ref C). 
Neither of these expectations was met.  This decision is the 
latest in a string of events -- such as recent news of 
increased forced labor incidences in Rakhine State and the 
GOB\'s increasingly weak effort to cooperate with the ILO to 
punish those involved in forced labor (ref B) -- that make it 
clear there is no political will to tackle the forced labor 
component of trafficking in persons.  We will emphasize our 
concerns over the court\'s decision when and if Labor Minister 
Tin Winn agrees to meet with the Chief of Mission (ref A).

1. (C) Summary:  Following the October 19 removal of General 
Khin Nyunt as Prime Minister and Chief of Military 
Intelligence (ref A), 32 journals and magazines with links to 
Military Intelligence (MI) have apparently been temporarily 
closed down.  Quasi-independent media licensed through other 
ministries have so far been unaffected by yesterday\'s events. 
 It is unclear whether the MI Office of Strategic Studies 
will retain its function of censorship over international 
publications and the high-profile, bilingual Myanmar Times. 
Stripping Military Intelligence of its media appendages will 
deprive MI of some income.  This could be part of a broader 
move ordered by the regular military to separate MI from the 
business dealings that provide its operating costs. End 
summary. 
 
2. (C) Journals and magazines that had been operating under 
license from Military Intelligence have been told to 
temporarily halt publication according to a source at one of 
the affected journals.  Although this week\'s editions will 
appear, publishers were told when they submitted them to the 
Home Ministry\'s Press Scrutiny Board for censorship to halt 
work on the next edition until they obtain new licenses.  The 
source says that 32 publications may be affected, including 
the 7 Day News, the Myanmar News Gazette, Wun Tha Nu, the 
Morning Post, and the high profile Myanmar Times, a colorful 
bilingual weekly newspaper run jointly by an Australian 
businessman and the son of MI Brigadier General Thein Swe. 
The Myanmar Times had unique status as the only local 
publication that received censor board clearance from MI\'s 
Office of Strategic Studies, rather than the Press Scrutiny 
Board.  Sources at the Myanmar Times say they have not 
received clearance on this week\'s edition because their usual 
interlocutors at MI are either under arrest or unavailable. 
However, the newspaper intends to proceed with a planned move 
to larger quarters, under the assumption that the stoppage is 
temporary in nature. 
 
3. (SBU)  Publishers of quasi-independent media (weekly 
newspapers and journals run by private citizens with a

press censorship rules) not affiliated with MI, such as 
Myanmar Dana and Kumudra, have said they don\'t appear to be 
affected by the change in leadership.  Strangely, however, 
they were granted a respite this next week from carrying the 
usual obligatory \"policy\" diatribe reprinted from opinion 
pages of the government-run media. 
 
4. (C) Comment:  Seen in the context of economic competition 
between MI and the regular military (described in ref B), 
stripping Military Intelligence of its media appendages will 
deprive MI of some income, though not a large amount. 
However, this could be part of a broader move ordered by the 
regular military to separate MI from the business operations 
that provide its budget.  End comment.

1, (C)  Summary:  The two SPDC members promoted in the 
shuffle that led to Prime Minister Khin Nyunt\'s \"retirement\" 
in Rangoon on October 19 have apparently been chosen 
primarily for their loyalty to Senior General Than Shwe and 
their willingness to subordinate themselves to him.  They 
have also shown themselves to be ruthless, opportunistic 
operators.  Biographic information on the promoted officials 
follows.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Lieutenant-General Soe Win, General Khin Nyunt\'s 
replacement as Prime Minister of Burma, has advanced his 
career and reputation as a capable, loyal supporter of the 
Burmese strongman, Senior General Than Shwe, Chairman of the 
State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).  Cunning and 
ambitious, he has shown willingness to go the extra mile for 
the Senior General and those closest to him.  There are 
credible reports that he directed the May 2003 attack in 
Depayin on Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters. 
 
3. (C)  After joining the SPDC in 1997, Soe Win was promoted 
to \"Secretary Two\" and rapidly advanced to \"Secretary One\" in 
August 2003.  He has consolidated his power base as a 
\"patron\" of the Union Solidarity Development Association 
(USDA), the regime\'s mass organization and political arm (and 
a pet project of General Than Shwe).  He is said to now 
control the entire USDA organization.  Unlike the deposed 
Khin Nyunt, who had a strong following among his former 
subordinates in the now bruised military intelligence (MI) 
wing of the armed forces, the new Prime Minister has formed 
his primary power base among civilians in the USDA.  He had 
previously demonstrated ability to deal effectively with 
civilians while serving as the military commander in Monywa. 
He has also shown a flair for the dramatic, pulling himself 
out from a pile of troops who had been killed--while under 
his command--in a battle with communist forces in the \'80s. 
This earned him the nickname, \"Strong Life.\" 
 
4.  (C)  Born in the Shan State on May 10, 1949, the newly 
appointed Prime Minister graduated from the Defense Services 
Academy in 1970. While holding the rank of Major in 1988, he 
commanded Light Infantry Division (LID)-22 under Lt. General 
Tin Hla (Deputy Prime Minister for Military Affairs, 
2000-2001).  LID-22 played an important role in the crackdown 
on the 1988 uprising for democracy. Unconfirmed reports 
suggest that then Major Soe Win issued the order to fire the 
first shots at City Hall on August 8, 1988. 
 
5.  (C)  The new Prime Minister was quoted by the Democratic 
Voice of Burma (DVB) in January 2003 as saying the SPDC would 
\"never negotiate with Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD.\"  This 
comment was reportedly made at a meeting of the USDA with 
local authorities and civil servants in mid-January 2003, 
well before the May 2003 attack.  He has also reportedly said 
that Burma can rely on China to protect it against the United 
States. 
 
6.  (U)  Lt. General Soe Win is married to Than Than Hwe, but 
little else is known about his personal life.  He has 
delivered public addresses in understandable English, but is 
said to have limited ability to speak the language 
extemporaneously. 
 
Lieutenant-General Thein Sein--Another Loyal Follower of the 
Senior General 
 
7. (C)  Lieutenant-General Thein Sein has been chosen to move 
up from \"Secretary Two\" to replace Soe Win as \"Secretary One\" 
in the SPDC.  By all accounts a quiet personality who shuns 
the spotlight, he was born on April 20, 1945 in Pathein, 
Irrawaddy Division.  In 1988, then Major Thein Sein served as 
commander of Light Infantry Division (LID)-55, one of the 
elite organizations loyal to the Burmese Socialist Program 
Party (BSPP).  In that capacity, he distinguished himself, as 
did Soe Win, in the crackdown against the 1988 uprising in 
support of democracy. 
 
7. (SBU)  In late 1996, Thein Sein was promoted to the rank 
of Brigadier General and assigned to the then newly formed 
Triangle Region Command in Kengtung.  He became a member of 
the SPDC in 1997.  In 2001, after being promoted to Major 
General, he was transferred to Rangoon and assigned to the 
post of Adjutant General.  In this capacity, he was 
responsible for the MoD\'s business interests.  He was 
appointed \"Secretary Two\" of the SPDC on August 25, 2003. As 
are Prime Minister Soe Win and other members of the SPDC, 
Thein Sein is a \"patron\" of the USDA (note: The 
organization\'s \"patrons\" form, in effect, its policy making 
body).  He is also Chairman of the National Convention 
Commission, Chairman of the Central Organizing Committee for 
War Veterans, Chairman of the Committee on Prevention of 
Recruitment of Child Soldiers, and Chairman of the Police 
Reform Committee.  He is slated to accompany Senior General 
Than Shwe to India on October 24. 
 
8. (U)  The new \"Secretary One\" is married to Khin Khin Win, 
who is not known to have any important political connections. 
 He is thought to have limited English ability and little, if 
any, experience in the West.

1. (C) Summary: Despite a week of significant political 
change in Burma, we have seen no signs that SPDC Chairman 
Senior General Than Shwe plans to cancel a trip planned to 
India on October 24.  If Than Shwe travels as planned, it 
would be an additional sign that the SPDC has effected a 
seamless, and bloodless, ouster of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt 
as well as further indication of rapidly warming Burma-India 
relations.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Despite a week of tumultuous political change in 
Burma, including the dramatic ouster of Prime Minister 
General Khin Nyunt, we have seen no signs that SPDC Chairman 
Senior General Than Shwe plans to cancel his upcoming trip to 
India.  Sources within the Government of Burma, and at the 
Indian Embassy in Rangoon, tell us that Than Shwe will depart 
Rangoon, as scheduled, on Sunday October 24 for a five-day 
trip to New Delhi and several upcountry sites. 
 
3. (C) The trip, if it takes place, will be Than Shwe\'s first 
to India and the first visit of a Burmese Head of State in 
over 20 years (former dictator Ne Win visited India in 1980). 
 The GOB characteristically has not released a delegation 
list, but sources indicate that dozens of senior government 
and military officials will join the entourage as well as 
several Than Shwe family members. 
 
4. (SBU) The 71-year old Senior General is an infrequent 
traveler, and rarely ventures outside out Burma.  His last 
foreign trip was to China in January 2003.  By all accounts, 
his planned trip to India is entirely motivated by a personal 
desire to see the neighboring country before he dies. 
Reportedly, highlights of trip will include visits to holy 
Buddhist sites, including a pilgrimage to Buddha-gaya, the 
birthplace of Buddha in Utter Pradesh.  The Indian Embassy 
also adds that Than Shwe is expected to meet with President 
Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Minister of 
External Affairs Natwar Singh. 
 
5. (S) GOB sources, and the Indian Embassy, have downplayed 
expectations that the trip will produce any deliverables. 
However, according to secret GOB documents, at least one 
ministry (Communications, Posts, and Telegraphs) expects the 
trip to result in the implementation of several dozen 
projects envisioned in an August 2003 MOU between the two 
countries.  The projects include cooperation, and Indian 
assistance, in a variety of technical areas, mostly involving 
information technology.  An additional priority for the GOB 
is implementation of projects under an existing Indian soft 
loan of over $10 million. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  If Than Shwe travels as planned, it would be 
an additional sign that the SPDC has effected a seamless, and 
bloodless, ouster of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt and is 
comfortable enough to continue with regime business as usual 
(ref A).  The trip would also be a further indication of 
rapidly warming Burma-India relations, highlighted by a 2003 
visit to Rangoon by Indian Vice President Bhairon Singh 
Shekhawat (ref B) and, in the interim, a plethora of 
senior-level exchanges.  India\'s \"Look East\" policy (ref C), 
placing a priority on economic and security goals and on 
balancing China\'s influence, is warmly welcomed by a Burmese 
regime delighted that yet another neighboring country is 
willing to leave democracy and human rights off of the 
bilateral agenda.  As the Indian Ambassador recently told the 
COM and other diplomats: \"India\'s overriding concern is a 
good relationship with this (Burmese) government; 
democracy... is secondary.\"  End Comment.

1. (SBU) Summary: UNHCR officials took the opportunity of a 
senior-level visit to Burma to stress that the time was not 
right for repatriation of Burmese refugees from Thailand. 
However, they said that roving missions and assessments in 
the eastern border regions were very important and would 
continue.  UNHCR is waiting to see if there will be any 
impact of the SPDC\'s power shift on UNHCR\'s nascent efforts 
in the East.  End summary. 
 
UNHCR Visitors Not Encouraging Repatriation 
 
2. (U) UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner Kamel Morjane and 
UNHCR Director for Asia and the Pacific Janet Lim visited 
Burma from October 18-21 to assess UNHCR\'s longstanding 
operations in northern Rakhine State and some tentative new 
operations along the eastern border with Thailand.  The two 
officials traveled to Tanintharyi Division (near the Thai 
border), met with GOB interlocutors and a dozen partner NGOs, 
and briefed the Chief of Mission and other Rangoon diplomats 
on October 20. 
 
3. (SBU) Mr. Morjane stressed repeatedly that despite the 
agency\'s expansion into eastern Burma (pursuant to a February 
agreement with recently ousted PM Khin Nyunt; ref B) UNHCR 
was not encouraging the return to Burma of some or all of the 
estimated 133,000 refugees in Thailand.  He said that surveys 
by UNHCR\'s local staff, and his own trip, reinforced the fact 
that the region was not ready socio-economically and the 
logistical infrastructure was not in place for the return of 
\"even 1,000\" refugees.  The Chief of Mission noted these were 
crucial topics to explain clearly to donors, and lauded local 
UNHCR staff for getting the message across well over the last 
several months. 
 
4. (SBU) Mr. Morjane said, however, that it was important for 
UNHCR to continue its \"roving missions\" to Karen and Mon 
States and Tanintharyi Division to provide some basic 
assistance and prepare a more in-depth assessment of the 
region should the political conditions for return improve 
suddenly.  He indicated that UNHCR\'s NGO implementing 
partners, after a \"frank exchange of views,\" urged the UN 
agency to continue its activities in Rakhine State and in the 
eastern border area. 
 
Worrisome Changes? 
 
5. (SBU) Mr. Morjane did express some concern regarding the 
recent power shift in the SPDC, which saw the ouster of 
former Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt (ref A).  Because 
the UNHCR\'s access to the Thai border regions is based on an 
accord signed with Khin Nyunt, there is some uncertainty 
whether the agreement will outlive his prime ministership. 
Mr. Morjane said UNHCR intended to lie low for the moment and 
not press the issue.

1.(U) Summary: On October 21, the new Foreign Minister, U 
Nyan Win, briefed the Rangoon diplomatic corps for the first 
time. The FonMin characterized the many recent cabinet 
shuffles as \"normal\" and said the changes were made to 
\"assure success of the seven-step democratization process\" 
and that efforts to have the ethnic groups \"return to the 
legal fold\" would continue. The FonMin made specific charges 
that former PM Khin Nyunt was linked to extensive (over 30 
million USD) corruption.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On very short notice on October 21, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) called in all Rangoon heads of mission 
for a briefing by the new Foreign Minister, U Nyan Win. This 
was the FonMin\'s debut for the local diplomatic corps, as he 
has remained a relatively unknown quantity since taking 
office on September 19 (see Ref A). The FonMin provide an 
informative and useful briefing, in good English with no 
interpreter, and with minimal reference to notes.  He earned 
passing marks from an audience accustomed to GOB briefings 
which either bore or bewilder. 
 
3. (U)  The FonMin repeated the October 19 GOB statement (Ref 
C) that \"the Prime Minister had been permitted to retire for 
health reasons\" and added that the former PM was in his 
residence with his family (regime-speak for house arrest). 
The FonMin characterized the many cabinet and SPDC shuffles 
over the past month as \"normal\" and said it was \"time to pass 
the baton to a new generation\" as \"times call for a change.\" 
He also reiterated the message he gave the COM on October 5 
(see Ref A) when he told the assembled diplomats that there 
would be \"no change in foreign policy or domestic priorities.\" 
 
4. (U)  He answered questions that were uppermost in the 
minds of the audience by stating that \"the decision to 
undertake the seven-step road map was not an individual 
decision but a decision of the SPDC,\" that the retirement of 
Khin Nyunt \"will not affect it,\" and that the changes in the 
government were made to \"assure success of seven-step 
democratization process.\" The FonMin used standard regime 
phraseology when he said that efforts will continue to have 
the ethnic groups \"return to the legal fold.\" He went on to 
say that the nation must \"close gaps among the races.\" 
 
5. (C) The most surprising moment came when the FonMin made 
specific charges that the former PM (chief of military 
intelligence - MI) was linked to a specific corruption scheme 
to the tune of 30 billion kyat (over 30 million USD).  The 
FonMin made detailed reference to a September clash on the 
Burma-China border (see Ref B) between the Burmese Army and 
the NaSaKa (an interagency unit that includes MI, customs, 
and immigration elements).  The Foreign Minister said that 
Prime Minister Khin Nyunt \"must bear responsibility for those 
under him.\" This is the regime\'s first official statement 
alleging corruption on the part of Khin Nyunt and MI. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  The FonMin\'s message that there would be no 
change in either foreign or domestic policies was not 
unexpected.  However, given Khin Nyunt\'s fall from grace, one 
would expect that even if the ideas contained in the \"seven 
step road map\" (which has always been considered Khin Nyunt\'s 
creation) were retained, the \"road map\" would have been 
renamed and relaunched as a new  product of the new PM and 
company. Instead, it seems the regime is content to use a 
road map that can only lead Burma on a never-ending journey 
towards a democratic future that seems ever more distant. 
End Comment.

1.  (C)  Summary:  After perfunctory SPDC-KNU talks on 
October 19 failed to get off the ground because of changes in 
GOB leadership, the regime will likely resume negotiations in 
December-January, when the dust from deposed Prime Minister 
Khin Nyunt\'s \"retirement,\" (hanging over Military 
Intelligence-MI-which has had the lead on ethnic relations), 
is expected to settle.  Meanwhile, a senior Thai military 
intelligence officer came calling from Bangkok to reassure 
the Burmese that the RTG will not interfere in their internal 
affairs. End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  Despite confusion surrounding changes in the 
Burmese regime\'s leadership, the latest round of SPDC-KNU 
talks opened in Rangoon on October 19 following several 
earlier delays (ref C).  Brig Gen Kyaw Thein led the SPDC 
team while Pado Tu Tu Lay and Pado David Htaw headed the 
16-member KNU delegation.  Given a temporary vacuum left on 
the Burmese side by Prime Minister Khin Nyunt\'s \"retirement\" 
on the evening of October 19 (refs A and B), the discussions 
apparently reverted to being largely social occasions.  SPDC 
representatives \"escorted\" the KNU delegation to Bago for a 
farewell luncheon on October 20, following meals together the 
previous day.  The KNU team proceeded to Hpa-an (Karen State) 
from Bago and crossed the Thai border to Mae Sot on October 
21.  Press reports suggesting that members of the KNU 
delegation were detained or went missing at some point along 
the line are incorrect, according to reliable local sources. 
 
3.  (C)  U Khun Myat (aka Khunmyat Lahtaw), a wealthy Kachin 
businessman and well established government intermediary on 
ethnic affairs, told poloff on October 22 that negotiations 
for a permanent cease-fire between the GOB and the Karen 
National Union (KNU) will resume in December-January.  The 
exact dates the government will propose for the talks will 
depend on when the current \"re-shuffle\" within Military 
Intelligence has been completed and when the National 
Convention (NC) will resume its deliberations.  If meetings 
are conducted under the NC\'s umbrella in December, the 
negotiations are likely to be pushed off until after the 
first of the new year.  If the Convention does not crank up 
until January, discussions with the Karens could begin 
earlier. 
 
4.  (C)  The SPDC\'s basic policies of \"Non-Disintegration of 
the Union\" and \"National Consolidation\" remain firmly in 
place, emphasized U Khun Myat.  He noted that while MI will 
continue to have the lead on negotiations with the ethnics, 
he thought it likely that whomever is appointed as the senior 
negotiator would report through the new MI chief to the newly 
appointed \"Secretary One,\" Lt. General Thein Sein (refs A and 
B), rather than to the Prime Minister (as was the case under 
Khin Nyunt).  However, Khun Myat added, the deposed Prime 
Minister\'s policy of offering the cease-fire groups (CFGs) 
business concessions and other commercial \"privileges\" will 
likely remain in place. 
 
5.  (C)  In a related but separate development, Lt. General 
Samut Phoke (sp?), a Thai military intelligence officer, 
happened by U Khun Myat\'s house while poloff was meeting with 
the latter.  He was accompanied by an employee of Bangkok 
Airways, who was there to discuss expansion of that service\'s 
flights between Bangkok and Rangoon.  U Khun Myat, who 
apparently has interests in Bangkok Airways, had facilitated 
meetings for the visiting General to re-assure Burmese 
counterparts who had expressed unease about the RTG\'s being 
out in front with public announcements earlier in the week on 
local leadership changes (ref D).

SUBJECT: PUSHING A BIG ROCK UP A STEEP HILL: UNFPA TRIES TO 
IMPROVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN UPPER BURMA 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  The UNFPA\'s three-day tour through upper 
Burma in mid-October for members of the diplomatic community 
and INGOs presented a microcosm of life today in this 
country: a graceful, capable people burdened by a Government 
that takes decisions based on its own interests. End Summary 
 
2.  (U)  The United Nations Population Fund\'s (UNFPA) local 
representative (Najib Assifi--Afghan) organized and led a 
October 11-13 trip to Upper Burma (Mandalay, Monywa, 
Amarapura, and surrounding villages) for members of the 
diplomatic corps from Rangoon and Bangkok, including poloff. 
The Director of Southeast Asian affairs in the Danish Foreign 
Ministry in Copenhagen also participated, as did 
representatives of Rangoon-based INGOs working on public 
health issues. 
 
Expanded UNFPA Program in Burma...... 
 
3.  (U)  The UNFPA organized the trip to showcase its 
assistance for improved reproductive health in rural areas, 
and to gain additional donor support.  In September 2001, the 
Fund\'s Executive Board approved an expanded assistance 
program for Burma, 2002-2005, which aims to reduce maternal 
mortality, and to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.  The Board 
approved a special budget of USD 20 million for UNFPA over 
the four-year life of the expanded program, thereby doubling 
the amount of assistance (USD 10 million) that UNFPA Burma 
had provided during the \'90s.   However, UNFPA Headquarters 
in New York has provided only USD 12 million of the expanded 
budget.  The local office is expected to raise the balance. 
 
4.  (U)  Toward those ends, the Fund took the group to nine 
separate medical facilities around Mandalay and Monywa--four 
hours apart over a rough, washed out road--that it supports 
with information about HIV/AIDS, birth control (including 
distribution of condoms and advocacy for their use); and 
other aspects of reproductive health, including \"birth 
spacing\" (note: The Government advocates a pro-natal policy 
which precludes \"family planning.\")  UNFPA Burma has extended 
its support for such programs to facilities in 94 townships 
in 2004, and hopes to reach 100 townships by next year (note: 
There are 324 recognized townships in Burma.)  The UNFPA\'s 
resident representative estimates that his agency\'s 
assistance programs currently reach 15-20% of the relevant 
population in the participating townships.  Rather than 
trying to expand beyond the targeted communities, he hopes to 
increase the numbers of people that draw on the assistance 
available in the participating communities. 
 
.....Has Produced Positive Results.... 
 
5.  (U)  At several of the sites visited, smiling Burmese 
teens and twenty-somethings proclaimed the values of \"safe 
sex\" through condom use.  A villager informed the visitors 
that he and his wife had seven grown children, one of whom 
promptly stood up and proclaimed loudly that she did not want 
to have more than three children.  At a youth center 
supported by the UNFPA, and endorsed by the regional military 
commander, a mixed group of young people performed a play 
that concluded with the hero confiding sadly to his friend 
that he was HIV-positive following an encounter with a 
prostitute.  The hundreds of villagers who watched the 
performance with the UNFPA-sponsored group smiled, frowned, 
and clapped at the appropriate times.  Some of this was 
surely staged.  However, the messages were clear and 
seemingly well received.  At the very least, the activity 
provided a positive environment for youth with little else to 
do. 
 
6.  (U)  The UNFPA\'s guests also received briefings on 
training programs for midwives, assistant midwives, and 
\"Community Support Groups.\"  Members of the latter were said 
to be ordinary villagers who, following one or two days of 
training, are capable of serving as liaisons between 
villagers and medical facilities in larger villages and 
townships.  At the Women\'s Medical Center in Mandalay, an 
energetic British nurse sponsored by the WHO showed the 
visiting group how she taught Burmese midwives to get women 
into the most comfortable positions to give birth.  The 
trainees were on the floor of a hospital for this purpose as 
the group entered the training facility. 
 
.......But Probably Not Enough 
 
7.  (SBU)  The obstacles to improving health care in rural 
Burma, however, are enormous.  Maternal mortality rates in 
the country are currently around 60 per 1,000 births, 90 per 
1,000 in more remote areas.  Data are hard to verify, but 
some 80 percent of all births are thought to occur in homes. 
Morbidity rates while giving birth are considerably lower 
among women in the major urban areas, but the Government\'s 
capacity to provide medical care of any kind to village 
dwellers is limited.  The political will to do so in the 
ethnic areas is even more tenuous.  For example, a German 
doctor based in Rangoon with \"Malteser Germany\" (INGO with 
home office in Cologne) bemoaned the extreme lack of medical 
care in Northern Rakhine State during an earlier conversation 
with poloff, telling the latter than an entire generation of 
Muslim youth in that state is growing up malnourished. 
 
8.  (SBU)  The structure is not in place within the Burmese 
Government to address these problems.  One of the Burmese 
doctors who briefed the UNFPA-organized group said, in 
response to a question, that he received a salary of kyat 
8,000 per month (approximately eight USD).  He also said he 
is one of three doctors serving a population of 150,000. 
Another Burmese doctor, currently the head of surgery in 
Mandalay and an outspoken critic of the SPDC, told poloff 
privately on the margins of the official trip that the GoB 
has diluted and shortened medical training so much that it 
will adversely affect the quality of care in the future. 
 
Beggar Thy Neighbor....... 
 
9.  (SBU)  Burma\'s neighbors are not helping.  In some cases, 
they are part of the problem.  The Malaysian Ambassador to 
Burma confided that his government had recently reached 
official agreement with the GoB to bring 100 qualified 
Burmese doctors--including ten specialists--to Malaysia on 
three-year assignments.  This would be mutually beneficial, 
stressed the Ambassador: the Burmese doctors will make good 
salaries while working in modern facilities and the Malaysian 
Government will be able to offer more health care to its 
citizens living in rural areas.  Moreover, added the 
Ambassador, the Malaysian Embassy in Rangoon is issuing some 
120 visas to Burmese citizens every day to take up jobs in 
Malaysia.  Rangoon-based recruiters identify prospective 
staff to meet requirements sent by needy employers in 
Malaysia. 
 
......While the Government Looks On 
 
10.  (SBU)   Army troops, including military intelligence 
officials, and police were much in evidence throughout the 
October 11-13 trip.  In addition, members of the Myanmar 
Maternal and Child Welfare Association (MMCWA), a GONGO run 
by Burmese military wives, played a prominent part in the 
group\'s program.  During a visit to a MMCWA facility 
supported by the UNFPA in Amarapura, a local MMCWA official 
said her organization had a total of 3.79 million members 
countrywide.  The MMCWA has a staff member assigned to the 
UNFPA\'s office in Rangoon to help direct the agency\'s 
assistance projects. 
 
11.   (SBU)  Final Comments:  The UNFPA trip was, in several 
ways, a microcosm of life today in Burma.  For three days, 
members of the group saw a graceful, capable people, willing 
and able to employ foreign assistance to good advantage; and 
an international organization that is trying hard to 
contribute to improved living conditions.  These developments 
are taking place under a government that controls--for its 
own benefit--the way the assistance is delivered while not 
supporting the related processes and doing little to 
contribute to the longer-term goals.  The overall result is a 
declining standard of living and increasingly depleted 
populus.

1. (C) Summary: A week after Khin Nyunt\'s ouster there is 
calm in the streets, Than Shwe seems comfortably in power, 
and MI\'s political and probably economic power is being 
eroded.  However, there remain many variables -- especially 
relations with ethnic cease-fire groups post-Khin Nyunt -- 
that could shake things up.  End summary. 
 
Khin Nyunt: Corrupt, Not Unhealthy 
 
2. (C) After allowing former Prime Minister General Khin 
Nyunt to \"retire for health reasons\" on October 19th, SPDC 
Chairman, Senior General Than Shwe changed his tune.  On 
October 24th, new PM Lt. General Soe Win and Than Shwe\'s 
right-hand man General Thura Shwe Mann addressed a large 
group of \"entrepreneurs\" (as business cronies are generously 
called) explaining that Khin Nyunt had been sacked because of 
\"insubordination...bribery and corrupt practices, and for 
failure to carry out duties properly.\"  Specifically the two 
noted a September incident in Muse on the Chinese border 
where regular army troops moved against a notoriously corrupt 
MI-affiliated border unit (ref C).  Dubious official 
justifications aside, we continue to believe the real reasons 
for Khin Nyunt\'s removal stemmed from long-standing personal 
and economic conflicts between MI and the regular military 
(ref D). 
 
3. (U) Soe Win and Shwe Mann used their remarks (heavily 
publicized on local television and in the GOB\'s mouthpiece 
newspaper \"The New Light of Myanmar\") to proclaim repeatedly 
that \"no one is above the law\" and that the regime will move 
decisively against anyone -- either in the military or 
private sector -- who \"adversely affects the national 
polices.\" 
 
Than Shwe: A Comfort Zone 
 
4. (C) Despite rumors that there are ongoing tensions within 
the SPDC, Than Shwe departed as scheduled on October 24th for 
a long-planned state visit to India.  This shows supreme 
confidence that his deputy, Vice Senior General Maung Aye, 
has no scheme in place to move against the Senior General and 
lends credence to the notion that the two connived to rid the 
SPDC leadership of Khin Nyunt and the hated MI. 
 
5. (C) Indeed in the last week there have been several overt 
moves to eliminate the political and economic powers of MI, 
while preserving the institution -- essential to the 
maintenance of the SPDC\'s power.  As reported in ref B, 
following Khin Nyunt\'s removal, the SPDC named former Rangoon 
Division Regional Commander Major General Myint Swe as the 
new head of MI.  On October 22nd, the SPDC abolished the 
30-year old National Intelligence Bureau (NIB), the committee 
that oversaw all intelligence and state-security operations 
carried out by, among others, MI and the Ministry of Home 
Affairs\' Special Branch, Bureau of Special Investigations, 
and Criminal Investigation Department police agencies (ref 
A).  The Bureau was chaired by ex-PM Khin Nyunt, giving him 
tremendous power over his fellow citizens and fellow SPDC 
members. 
 
6. (C) It is unclear what will replace the NIB, but we are 
confident a new coordinating body will be formed under firm 
control of the regular military.  One unverified report we\'ve 
heard is that the SPDC will establish a new \"Inland Security\" 
Ministry that will take over the NIB\'s role but which will be 
controlled by someone personally loyal to the Senior General. 
 
Economic Conditions: Waiting for New Palms to Grease 
 
7. (C) On the economic front there is uncertainty.  Traders 
report authorities have tightened border controls, making it 
more difficult to smuggle in goods from Thailand and China. 
One eyewitness in Taunggyi, an entrepot in southern Shan 
State near the Thai border, indicated that black market 
gasoline and diesel have disappeared from the streets as have 
the dozens of illegally imported and unlicensed vehicles. 
She said it was difficult to import these things as normal 
since the shake-up because MI\'s role in facilitating illegal 
border trade had been supplanted, but the new \"regime\" had 
not yet settled into place.  One gem smuggler told us the 
usual route between Mogok (Burma\'s ruby and sapphire capital 
in Mandalay Division) and Thailand was closed for now, but 
should be back to normal \"in a month or two.\" 
 
8. (C) The crackdown on those close to Khin Nyunt and MI has 
been inconsistent.  Reliable sources report a large MI front 
trading company has been closed and Bagan CyberTech, run by 
Khin Nyunt\'s son, has been taken over by the army\'s signal 
corps.  However, Khin Nyunt cronies involved in projects 
deemed \"state priorities,\" such as edible oil production, or 
who have family or other ties to Than Shwe or Maung Aye have 
escaped the axe so far.  Newspaper photos of the October 24th 
lecture on corruption and rule of law included a few of those 
cronies closest to the ex-PM, apparently still in the legal 
fold. 
 
Comment: Wait and See 
 
9. (C) Despite the seamless ousting of Khin Nyunt and the 
apparent return to business as usual in Rangoon, there is 
still angst in the air.  The business community is wary of 
what a new order will bring in terms of vital smuggling 
operations and economic policy.  Though there has not yet 
been a complete purge of business people with previous MI 
ties, they worry about their economic and personal futures. 
Politically there is also much insecurity with rumors rampant 
of more changes to come, and the uncertainty of whether SPDC 
relations with the various cease-fire groups can continue 
placidly without Khin Nyunt -- the author of the cease-fire 
\"agreements.\"  End comment.

1.  (C)  Summary:  Minister of Labor U Tin Winn told COM on 
October 25 that his government would \"reassess the utility of 
the ILO\" if the ILO\'s Governing Body decided to implement the 
measures outlined in Article 33 of the International Labor 
Conference\'s resolution of 2000. In response to our statement 
of concern about the safety and the continued detention of 
ASSK, the Minister responded that it \"was only temporary.\" 
The Minister was dismissive of the need for the return of the 
Special Envoy or the Special Rapporteur, saying the SE has 
visited 12 times since he was appointed to his position and 
less than one year has passed since the SR was here.  End 
Summary 
 
2.  (SBU)  The COM, accompanied by Poloff (notetaker), called 
on Minister of Labor U Tin Winn on October 25 to review the 
USG\'s views on actions the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) will likely take when Burma comes up for discussion by 
the ILO\'s Governing Body in Geneva on November 18.  Other 
subjects discussed during the contentious, but nevertheless 
cordial, 45-minute meeting were the USG\'s continuing deep 
concern about the SPDC\'s detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and U 
Tin Oo; the failure of the SPDC to allow the National League 
for Democracy (NLD) to function throughout the country and to 
participate in the National Convention (NC); the failure of 
the Government to allow United Nations Envoy Razali and 
United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Sergio 
Pinheiro to continue their work here; the ramifications for 
the Embassy\'s physical security of the GOB\'s publicly 
announced decision on October 22 to dissolve its National 
Intelligence Board--of which the Minister was a member--and 
the multiple official roles the Minister has played on behalf 
of the SPDC during the past few weeks in New York, Hanoi, and 
Rangoon. 
 
The GOB Will Close Local ILO Office if Labor Organization 
Invokes Article 33 Measures 
 
3.  (SBU)  The COM opened the discussion by saying the 
Embassy understands the Burmese Supreme Court\'s Special 
Appellate Branch had clearly stated on October 14 that 
contact with the ILO, and other international organizations, 
are not against the law.  She added that the USG further 
understands the Special Appellate Branch has reduced the 
sentences of the three individuals who had been sentenced to 
jail for, among other things, carrying business cards of the 
ILO representative in Burma at the time they were taken into 
custody.  The COM added that the Government has the authority 
to release the individuals on grounds of good behavior, and 
urged the GOB to do so. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Nevertheless, stressed the COM, we do not believe 
the ILO Governing Body is prepared to consider--nor would we 
support--reactivating the 2003 Plan of Action to combat 
forced labor until the Burmese Government releases the three 
individuals imprisoned for contact with the ILO; improves 
cooperation with the Rangoon ILO representative in 
investigating forced labor allegations; and ensures that 
Burmese citizens clearly understand their government does not 
condone reprisals against those who report incidents of 
forced labor. 
 
5.  (SBU)  In the latter connection, the COM mentioned the 
case in Toungup (southern Rakhine State), where there have 
been allegations of action being taken by local authorities 
against those who have informed the ILO of forced labor 
abuses.  A credible response from the authorities to this 
case is important, said the COM.  If the Government does not 
respond to such cases, it gives the impression that national 
authorities condone--even encourage--such action. 
 
6,  (SBU)  Minister U Tin Winn responded by saying the 
problems in Toungup had been caused by \"lower level\" 
officials.  He went on to say the Ministry of Labor has tried 
to investigate some cases, but had found it difficult to do 
so because of the need for \"transparency\" in notifying local 
officials that they were being investigated and the inability 
of the Labor Ministry to conduct undercover operations. 
(Note: The ILO has confirmed that the GOB has investigated 18 
of the 38 cases brought to its attention, but has yet to find 
anyone involved guilty.)  The COM responded by saying the GOB 
has considerable expertise and capacities in gathering 
intelligence that could be applied in cases of forced labor - 
she had previously seen successful undercover actions against 
such abuses in other countries, and is confident that the GOB 
could do the same if it has the political will to do so. 
 
7.  (C)  The Minister concluded this part of the discussion 
by muttering that he would pass the COM\'s concerns to the 
judiciary.  He also said--in much stronger tones--that the 
GOB would  \"reassess the utility of the ILO\" in the country 
in the event of a decision by the ILO\'s Governing Body to 
implement the measures outlined in Article 33 of the 
International Labor Conference\'s resolution of 2000.  When 
the COM pressed for a clarification of \"reassess\" he said 
that would mean closing ILO operations in country. 
 
Concern about Aung San Suu Kyi and National League for 
Democracy 
 
8.  (SBU)  The continuing detention of Aung San Suu Kyi 
(ASSK) and U Tin Oo raises serious doubt about the Burmese 
Government\'s commitment to a free, open society and to its 
own \"road map to democracy,\" said the COM.  The USG is very 
concerned about the safety of ASSK, she stressed, and the 
SPDC bears responsibility both for her release and for her 
safety.  ASSK\'s continued house arrest when she has neither 
committed, nor been charged with any crime, belies the 
government\'s stated commitment to national reconciliation and 
destroys its credibility.  The Minister responded by saying 
that the detention \"was only temporary\" and avoided 
responding to COM\'s request to define \"temporary.\" 
 
9.  (SBU)  The Government had invited NLD Chairman U Aung 
Shwe and other NLD Members-elect of Parliament to participate 
earlier this year (May 17, 2004) in the National Convention, 
responded the Minister, but they had refused.  There is 
nothing more the Government can do in this regard: \"If the 
NLD wants to live in a cocoon,\" so be it, said the Minister. 
As for the May 2003 incident in Depayin, that was a political 
matter, not an issue of forced labor or human rights, he 
added.  The Minister said he had told UN Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan that such things require time to sort out: \"the 
Burmese Government is trying as hard as possible to resolve 
the matter.\" 
 
National Convention to Resume in December-January 
 
10.  (SBU)  The National Convention (NC) will resume in 
December or January, said the Minister. The determining 
factors \"will be the weather, not politics.\" Questions of the 
harvest and road conditions must be taken in to account in 
order to ensure full participation by all members of the NC. 
 
Khin Nyunt Was \"Covered with Rust,\" Had To Be Replaced 
 
11. (SBU)   The Minister responded to COM\'s question as to 
his opinion on the recent changes of senior government 
officials by saying that deposed Prime Minister Khin Nyunt 
had to be replaced because he was \"covered with rust\" and 
needed to \"have it scraped.\"  He should have been replaced 
\"6-12 months before\" (the announcement of his retirement on 
October 19, ref A), said the Minister, a former MI officer 
himself and a close collaborator with the fallen Prime 
Minister while both were serving in MI. 
 
Why Razali and Pinheiro Can\'t Come Back to Burma 
 
12.  (SBU)  The COM told the Minister that his government\'s 
refusal to permit visits by the Special Envoy Razali or 
Special Rapporteur Pinheiro showed a lack of commitment to UN 
efforts to assist in addressing the issues of human rights 
and national reconciliation.  The Minister was dismissive, 
responding that the Special Envoy had been here \"12 times in 
four years\" and less than one year has passed since the 
Special Representative last visited the country. 
 
Dissolution of the Burmese National Intelligence Board 
 
13.  (SBU)  The Minister was a member of the Burmese 
Intelligence Board prior to its dissolution by the Government 
on October 22 (septel).  The COM inquired about the 
implications of this move, particularly for the physical 
security of the Embassy.  The Minister assured her that the 
Director of Police and the Minister of Home Affairs would 
continue to arrange for the American Embassy to be guarded 
diligently.  He was confident that the USG remained \"very 
strong\" and \"secure\" in Burma. 
 
The Minister\'s Many Hats 
 
14.  (SBU)  In addition to his portfolio in Labor, the 
Minister serves concurrently as Minister in the Prime 
Minister\'s office.  In the latter capacity, he headed the 
Burmese delegations to the recent opening of the United 
Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and to the ASEAN-European 
Ministerial Meeting (ASEM) in Hanoi earlier this month. The 
Minister said the Chairman of the SPDC, Senior General Than 
Shwe, had asked him to join the Burmese delegation to the 
opening of a trade exhibit in China in the Minister\'s 
capacity as a member of the Myanmar Economic Cooperation 
Committee.  (Note: There has not been a public announcement 
of the trip, the dates of which are unknown.) 
 
15.  (C)  Comment: A former Ambassador to the United States 
and earlier to Thailand, U Tin Winn is a highly experienced 
operator who clearly has the Senior General\'s confidence.  He 
has held several ministerial portfolios since his return to 
Rangoon from Washington in 2001.  While serving earlier in 
Military Intelligence, he was the government\'s chief 
negotiator with the Wa and Kokang cease-fire groups.  We are 
not sure whether the Minister\'s statement about closing the 
ILO\'s office in Rangoon would hold if the Governing Body 
invokes Article 33 measures against it in the November 
meeting in Geneva.  However, his will be a highly influential 
voice in any related discussions.  Absolutely nothing the 
government has done during the past few months suggests that 
it would hesitate to thumb its nose once again at the 
international community. End Comment

SUBJECT: THE ROUND-UP CONTINUES: MORE NLD ACTIVISTS PUT 
BEHIND BARS.....AGAIN 
 
REF: RANGOON 1257 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  The SPDC\'s round-up of the NLD\'s elected 
Members of Parliament continues, with more jail sentences and 
general harassment.  An estimated 150 of the original 392 
elected members remain free, but most of them have left their 
home communities and are living sub-rosa around Rangoon.  End 
Summary 
 
2.  (SBU)  In northern Shan State, local authorities 
succeeded in getting Sai Tun Aung of the Shan NLD to quit his 
post in early August.   However, U Than Htay, an elected MP 
from Lashio, resisted the pressure.  This led local 
authorities to arrest him in mid-August on four trumped-up 
charges involving the \"illegal\" sales of audio visual 
equipment and a cordless telephone.  Both were purchased from 
a legally registered electronic shop that belonged to Than 
Htay\'s son, who was detained at the same time.  On October 
25, father and son were both sentenced to five years in jail 
and hard labor plus fines of kyat 20,000 (approximately USD 
20).  Two drivers who worked at the son\'s shop were also 
arrested and sentenced to three months in jail. 
 
3.  (SBU)  In another recent case, U Thet Wai, chairman of 
the NLD in Sanchaung Township, Rangoon Division, was picked 
up on September 21 and charged with, \"inciting the general 
public to cause disorder that can affect government or public 
peace and tranquillity.\"  In fact, his crime was his 
friendship with U Ohne Thant (see below), the lone protester 
who was arrested in front of the United Nations Development 
Program\'s office in Rangoon on September 21 (reftel).  On 
October 25, U Thet Wai was sentenced to two years in jail. 
 
4.  (SBU)  As for U Ohne Thant, he too was sentenced on 
October 25 to two years in jail by a Special Tribunal inside 
Insein Prison.  U Ohne Thant is not a member of the NLD, but 
had close personal ties to U Thet Wai.  He has also been very 
active over the years with Burmese students. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Comment:  The Government is clearly targeting the 
NLD\'s elected Members of Parliament.  Estimates of the 
numbers in this group vary, depending on whether those who 
have \"resigned\" or been \"deregistered\" (total of 170) are 
counted.  The NLD, which has expelled 25 of its own elected 
members for disciplinary reasons, does not recognize 
\"resignations\" or \"deregistrations\" on the grounds that only 
Parliament has the authority to accept such changes.  A close 
observer of this ever shifting group estimates that 150 of 
the 392 who were elected to Parliament from the NLD in 1990 
are still active.  Most members of the group have left their 
home communities and are thought to be living sub-rosa in or 
around greater Rangoon. End comment.

SUBJECT: ECHO COMING TO BURMA 
 
REF: RANGOON 1386 
 
1. (U)  Summary:  The EU plans to open a Rangoon branch of 
the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) by the end 
of this year to monitor and supplement the considerable 
humanitarian assistance it currently provides for Burma 
programs from Bangkok and Brussels.  According to one 
Bangkok-based EC diplomat, if all goes well, and EU member 
states approve, ECHO will be the forerunner to a full EC 
delegation office in Rangoon.  In the meantime, the UK is 
looking at providing additional assistance if and when the 
GOB\'s human rights policies improve.  End Summary 
 
2. (U)  During course of the United Nations Population Fund\'s 
October 11-13 program in Upper Burma for the diplomatic 
community (reftel), the Charge d\'affaires of the European 
Commission delegation in Bangkok (Cauwenbergh) told poloff 
that ECHO will set up shop in Rangoon by the end of 2004. 
 
3. (U)  The Commission and the GOB have both given a green 
light to the proposal, which has long been in the planning 
stage.  ECHO will channel its assistance to Burma largely 
through INGOs and other international organizations, as does 
the Commission.  Cauwenbergh added that the ECHO branch will 
be opened and initially managed by a contract employee 
without diplomatic status, but is envisioned as a forerunner 
to a fully accredited European delegation facility.  The 
eventual up-grade to a full delegation office has not yet 
been approved by EU member states, cautioned the Charge. 
 
4. (U)  He said the European Commission currently provides 
some euros 25 million annually (USD 31-32 million) for Burma 
programs.  (Note:  Some of these funds go to organizations 
working with Burmese refugees in Thailand. End note.)  ECHO 
will likely have a separate assistance portfolio of \"several 
million euros.\"  Whether the latter funds will come from the 
existing budget, or supplement it, was not clear. 
Nevertheless, he expressed hope that on-the-ground monitoring 
would lead to more effective utilization of the EU\'s overall 
assistance funds. 
 
5. (SBU)  Comment:  The UK is the only EU member state to 
have a Rangoon-based foreign assistance professional working 
in its local Embassy (from the Department for International 
Development--DFID).  The DFID official (Rurik Marsden) is 
assessing economic assistance needs and capacities in civil 
society for absorbing and using foreign assistance.  He is 
currently putting the finishing touches on a country plan for 
Burma--concentrating on health care, HIV/AIDs, basic 
education, improving livelihoods in rural areas, and 
democratization---to have ready \"in case of political 
changes\" and related improvements in human rights.  In 
addition, the UK has pledged sterling 10 million over three 
years to the United Nations\' \"Fund for HIV/AIDS in Myanmar\" 
(FHAM), which is also supported by Norway and Sweden.  An 
officer in another EU member state embassy recently mused 
about how much of the EU\'s foreign assistance funds are 
siphoned off by the generals, and expressed hope that the 
presence and attention of ECHO staff will lead to closer 
monitoring of the considerable amounts of money flowing here 
from Brussels.  End comment.

1.  (C)  Summary:  The Coordinated Mekong Ministerial 
Initiative against Trafficking (COMMIT) moved forward in 
Rangoon, October 27-29.  All of the participating governments 
seemed to find a comfortable confluence of political, 
strategic, and operational elements in the MOU they signed 
and the supporting action plan they endorsed.  In the 
process, the Burmese junta got the international endorsement 
it seeks, and the reshuffled SPDC leadership accordingly 
joined the activities with seeming enthusiasm.  There appears 
to be genuine political momentum behind this regional effort 
which, whether it morphs into operational effectiveness 
against trafficking in persons or not, is a reality that will 
have to be considered in planning anti-trafficking assistance 
programs in this region.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  Cabinet-level and other officials from the six 
governments that form the COMMIT met in Rangoon on October 
27-29 (ref b) to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
pledging mutual cooperation against trafficking in persons 
(TIPs).  They also developed and approved--subject to review 
in capitals--a related action plan to support the precepts 
outlined in the MOU and to further previously approved 
bilateral agreements.  The operational plan, which will 
require foreign assistance to implement, will be up for 
approval at the COMMIT\'s next Senior Officers Meeting, 
tentatively scheduled for late March 2005 in Hanoi. 
 
3.  (U)  Cambodia, Laos, and Burma sent Cabinet-level 
officials to sign the MOU (Minister of Social Affairs, 
Minister of Labor, and Minister of Home Affairs, 
respectively); Vietnam was represented by its Vice-Minister 
of Public Security; the Chinese Vice Chairman of the State 
Council\'s National Working Committee for Children and Women 
signed on behalf of the PRC; and the Permanent Secretary in 
Thailand\'s Ministry of Social Development and Human Security 
initialed the document on behalf of the RTG (note: Thai 
Minister Sora-at Klinpratoom was a last minute no-show 
because of \"urgent duties\" in Bangkok). 
 
4.  (SBU)  Several Rangoon and Bangkok-based United Nations 
officials also attended, as did representatives from the 
Australian and UK (DFID) aid programs; and INGOs (World 
Vision and Save the Children).  PolEconoffs attended as 
observers.  Bangkok-based staff in the United Nations 
Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking in the Greater 
Mekong Sub-Region (UNIAP) served as the conference 
secretariat and also played an active supporting role in 
 
SIPDIS 
preparing substantive documents, guiding the process, and 
holding it together through the after-shocks from the recent 
political shuffle in Rangoon (ref a). 
 
New Burmese Prime Minister Opens Ministerial Conference 
 
5.  (SBU)  Giving his first public speech following his 
promotion on October 20, Prime Minister Lt. General Soe 
Win--resplendent in a crisply pressed army uniform--opened 
the ministerial portion of the conference on October 29 by 
advocating for regional cooperation.  He took a subtle swipe 
at Thailand (\"encouraging to see that ownership of the 
problem and responsibility are recognized as issues that need 
to be recognized by countries of destination\"), but he also 
commended the RTG for its efforts to register illegal migrant 
workers.  The Thai Permanent Secretary said in his statement 
prior to the MOU signing and later in a post-session press 
conference that the RTG had registered 1.2 million migrants 
in Bangkok--80 percent of whom were Burmese--during a 2003 
campaign to formalize the presence of such workers. 
 
Comprehensive Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
 
6.  (SBU)  As approved on October 29, the MOU lays out 
methods and areas of cooperation to combat all aspects of 
human trafficking.  The approved document addresses 
trafficking from a comprehensive perspective, including areas 
of policy and cooperation at the national and international 
levels; legal frameworks, law enforcement and criminal 
justice; protection, recovery and reintegration of victims; 
as well as preventive measures.  Embassy sent full texts of 
the MOU and the Plan of Action to EAP/BCLTV and G/TIP on 
October 29 for further circulation as desired. 
 
Action Plan Linked to MOU 
 
7.  (SBU)  Meeting October 27-28 following an opening speech 
by the Burmese Minister of Home Affairs, some 30 senior 
officials from the participating governments divided the 
supporting activities into five general areas:  policy and 
cooperation (e.g., mechanisms and systems for exchanging 
information, assessments of training needs); legal 
frameworks, law enforcement and justice (e.g., cooperation 
and investigation, as well as prosecution, of traffickers, 
including joint training and cross-border networking); 
protection, recovery, and reintegration (e.g., regional 
workshop on procedures for repatriation of victims, including 
development of common guidelines); preventive measures (e.g., 
collection and sharing of information on job, marriage and 
adoption brokers and agencies); and mechanisms for monitoring 
and evaluating implementation of the MOU (e.g., maintain 
existing COMMIT task forces in each country and work with 
UNIAP to develop a schedule for implementation of the Plan of 
Action). 
 
Atmospherics:  Chinese and Thai are Most Important Players 
 
8.  (C)  In a private conversation with poloff after the 
meeting, UNIAP\'s program director, Phil Robertson (Amcit), 
said the Thai and Chinese have taken pivotal roles in 
bringing regional cooperation on TIPs to this point.   Thai 
Prime Minister Thaksin, he said, aims to show that his 
government has not lost control of its borders and related 
social problems.  The Chinese, on the other hand, want to be 
part of a recognized international forum dealing with the 
international aspects of their southern and western flanks. 
Robertson also credited Dr. Saisaree Chutikul, a Thai social 
activist involved with the Commission for the Rights of the 
Child, for playing an important role in bringing the October 
27-29 conference to fruition and keeping related developments 
on track. 
 
Comment:  And the Burmese Government Also Benefits 
 
9.  (C)  Prime Minister Soe Win stated in his October 29 
address to the conference that regional cooperation on TIPs 
in this area is a \"win-win\" situation for all directly 
concerned (Note: most especially for the Burmese, since the 
COMMIT was launched in Rangoon. End note).  The new GOB 
leaders got a hearty international endorsement without 
exposing themselves to embarrassing questions, pressure about 
their human rights policies, or their own record on TIPs. 
 
10.  (C)  More importantly, however, there appears to be 
genuine momentum behind this regional effort.  The logical 
end to the exercise that took place in Rangoon last week 
could put recipient countries in the driver\'s seat with 
foreign assistance programs on TIPs.  If the process now set 
in motion plays out as the planners aim to have it develop, 
this could be beneficial, over the longer term, for both 
recipient and donor governments.  However, further evolution 
of intra-regional cooperation on TIPs with Burmese 
participation--with the generals continuing their abhorrent 
policies on human rights--could be a significant obstacle to 
USG assistance and engagement on a region-wide basis on TIPs\' 
issues.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  India\'s Ambassador to Burma concludes that 
the SPDC Chairman\'s October 24-29 visit to India was \"a very 
important success\" that addressed Burma\'s domestic situation, 
secured GOB support for an Indian UNSC seat, and yielded 
progress on bilateral security and trade issues.  The 
Ambassador acknowledges an important role for ASSK and the 
NLD, but believes that the party\'s importance will diminish 
if it can\'t influence the political situation.  Citing recent 
high-level meetings in Washington, the Ambassador viewed the 
U.S. as accepting that India\'s Burma policy has higher 
priorities than democracy and human rights.  Despite GOI 
assurances that India pressed Than Shwe to make forward 
movement on democracy (including freeing ASSK), we see no 
signs in Rangoon that the Indian Government intends to pursue 
these issues in any meaningful way with the Burmese regime. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On November 3, COM and P/E Chief called on the Indian 
Ambassador to Burma, Rajiv Kumar Bhatia, to discuss SPDC 
Chairman Senior General Than Shwe\'s October 24-29 visit to 
India.  Ambassador Bhatia was closely involved in the 
planning for the visit and participated in most events during 
the trip.  According to Bhatia, Monday October 25 was 
essentially \"Myanmar Day\" in New Delhi as a \"significant 
portion\" of the GOI was devoted to Than Shwe\'s schedule as 
well as to numerous bilateral meetings conducted with the 
eight Burmese ministers and two junta members who were part 
of the delegation. 
 
3. (C) The COM raised the joint India-Burma statement issued 
upon conclusion of the visit and inquired how and when the 
language had been negotiated.  Bhatia said he \"would not 
question the wisdom\" of his headquarters on this issue and 
demurred when asked if the text had been agreed upon prior to 
the trip, but intimated that this was probably the case. 
Bhatia described the statement\'s language on democracy as one 
of the most important aspects of the trip, particularly when 
viewed in the context of Former Defense Minister Fernandes\' 
parallel conference on Burma and the concurrent visit of UN 
Special Envoy to Burma Razali.  \"Allowing such events to 
occur during the visit of a head of state shows the 
flexibility of the Indian system,\" said Bhatia.  When the COM 
noted that the GOI had refused a visa for NCGUB \"Prime 
Minister-in-exile\" Sein Win to attend the Fernandes event, 
Bhatia replied \"We only denied one person, and we have 
consistently denied entry to that person for the past 15 
years.\" 
 
4. (C) Bhatia said that from the GOI\'s perspective, Than Shwe 
and his delegation successfully demonstrated that the Burmese 
regime is \"determined and sincere about effecting a 
transition to democracy.\"  However, he said, the GOB makes a 
compelling case that stability and economic development must 
be achieved before the regime hands over power.  The COM 
replied that the SPDC shows no desire to relinquish control 
and, in the absence of a timeline or freedom for democracy 
leaders, the \"road map\" lacks any credibility.  The COM also 
observed that official SPDC media photos of Burmese Embassy 
staff in New Delhi prostrating themselves on the ground 
before Than Shwe (a custom that does not exist in Burma) was 
symbolic of the broad control over the Burmese people that 
the generals seek to gain and maintain. 
 
5. (C) The COM noted reports that the GOI views Aung San Suu 
Kyi and the NLD as having lost their opportunity to effect 
political change (ref A).  Bhatia (who claims to \"stay in 
touch\" with the NLD) was less dismissive, saying that the 
\"ASSK and NLD dimension\" is an important one and 
acknowledging that ASSK still enjoys immense popularity among 
the Burmese people.  He insisted that the GOI had \"very 
clearly\" raised the ongoing detention of the NLD leadership 
with Than Shwe (but added that ASSK\'s international influence 
seems to grow the longer she is in detention, suggesting that 
house arrest is helpful to the democracy leader).  However, 
Bhatia said, the key issue for the NLD will be the party\'s 
ability to marshal support and influence the political 
process; if the NLD can\'t influence, then its importance will 
be diminished.  The COM replied that it is unrealistic to put 
the onus on the NLD while the party\'s leaders are still in 
detention, observing that \"all SPDC promises about a 
transition ring hollow if ASSK and U Tin Oo are not freed.\" 
 
6. (C) Ambassador Bhatia concluded that the Than Shwe visit 
was \"a very important success\" that had addressed Burma\'s 
domestic situation, secured GOB support for an Indian seat at 
the UN Security Council, and yielded progress on bilateral 
security and trade issues.  He added that as a result of 
recent senior-level meetings at the NSC and elsewhere in 
Washington, the GOI had concluded that \"the United States now 
has a much better understanding of India\'s perspective on, 
and policy toward, Myanmar\" -- suggesting that he believes 
the U.S. accepts that India has higher priorities than 
democracy and human in dealing with Burma.  The COM 
immediately reiterated that GOB promises mean nothing unless 
ASSK is freed, the NLD is allowed to play a meaningful role, 
and there is a credible timeline for next steps. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  Ambassador Bhatia, as well as others in New 
Delhi (ref A), gave assurances that India pressed Than Shwe 
to make forward movement on democracy and human rights 
(including freeing ASSK).  However, we see no signs in 
Rangoon that the Indian Government intends to pursue these 
issues in any meaningful way with the Burmese regime.  Vice 
President Shekhawat\'s 2003 visit to Burma (ref D) was the 
beginning of an ongoing charm offensive that has only the 
thinnest veneer of support for democratization.  According to 
senior NLD officials in Rangoon, no Indian official, or even 
locally-based Indian diplomat, has attended an NLD function 
or visited an NLD office in nearly 16 years.  The October 29 
joint statement envisions reciprocal visits by President 
Kalam and Prime Minister Singh to Burma (and a visit by new 
Burmese PM Soe Win to India).  By all appearances, the GOI\'s 
security and economic goals will likely dominate such prime 
opportunities to press the SPDC to make meaningful political 
changes.  End Comment.

1. (SBU) Summary: Two weeks before the ILO Governing Body\'s 
consideration of Burma, ILO\'s Rangoon liaison had more bad 
news about forced labor in Burma.  Despite some progress in a 
year-old treason case against three men who contacted the 
ILO, there were increasing incidents of forced labor, poor 
GOB cooperation in investigating allegations, and cases of 
retaliation against those who reported forced labor.  Even 
though the picture is bleak overall, the ILO liaison urged 
caution on supporting ILO sanctions against Burma, predicting 
\"swift retaliation\" by the GOB and a likely end to the ILO\'s 
good work here.  End summary. 
 
Good News and (Mostly) Bad News 
 
2. (SBU) In preparation for the mid-November discussion of 
Burma by the ILO Governing Body, on November 3rd ILO\'s 
Rangoon liaison briefed the Chief of Mission (COM) and other 
local diplomats on the forced labor situation.  Two issues 
currently dominate ILO\'s attention here: (1) an ongoing court 
case against three individuals convicted and sentenced to 
death in part for contact with the ILO; and, (2) the GOB\'s 
cooperation (or lack thereof) in pursuing allegations of 
forced labor (ref B and D).  The representative indicated 
that there\'d been some good news recently on the first topic, 
with the Supreme Court Appellate Branch announcing on October 
14th that, contrary to the wording of the initial conviction, 
it was not a crime to have contact with the ILO.  This 
element of the initial conviction was ordered removed. 
However, the Court did not release the three from prison as 
requested by the ILO, instead reducing their sentences to 
five years (for one individual also convicted of attempting 
to kill SPDC leaders) and three years (for two who were also 
convicted for their contacts with the outlawed, Thai-based 
Burmese trade union group the Federation of Trade Unions of 
Burma). 
 
3. (SBU) Despite this small improvement on the treason case, 
there were several negative trends that tarnished the period 
since the most recent ILO assessment in June.  Specifically, 
the ILO liaison noted the GOB\'s continued lack of progress 
investigating forced labor cases referred by the ILO.  Of the 
38 cases referred in 2004, the GOB has responded to only 18 
of them -- in each case rejecting the forced labor 
allegations.  One of the GOB\'s denials was of an allegation 
made directly by the ILO liaison based on his own eyewitness 
account of massive forced labor in Chin State (ref D). 
 
Punishing the Victims 
 
4. (SBU) Perhaps even more alarming to the ILO liaison are 
the increasing incidents of local GOB officials taking action 
against those who complain to the ILO about forced labor. 
The liaison noted in his November 4th report to ILO HQ that 
local police officials arrested, interrogated, and then 
released two individuals in Rangoon Division and three in 
Rakhine State after they had made reports to the ILO about 
forced labor in their communities.  The GOB has taken no 
action in these cases despite urgent requests by the ILO\'s 
Rangoon office. 
 
5. (SBU) In the same vein, the ILO liaison told diplomats of 
an incident where a judge rejected two plaintiffs\' 
allegations of forced labor then turned around and convicted 
the two of \"defaming\" the local official accused of requiring 
the labor.  The two were sentenced to six-months imprisonment. 
 
ILO: Sanctions Won\'t Work 
 
6. (SBU) Despite what the ILO liaison admits is a \"serious\" 
situation in Burma, he made clear to the diplomats attending 
that requesting a reactivation of the 2000 Article 33 
measures (ref C) would be counterproductive.  He said that 
this should be the last resort and would almost certainly 
lead to a stern and immediate retaliation by the GOB -- 
particularly, he thought, with the new \"less internationally 
minded\" Prime Minister in place.  COM noted that in an 
October 25th meeting with Labor Minister U Tin Winn (ref A), 
the minister had stated explicitly that reactivating Article 
33 measures would lead the GOB to eject the local ILO office. 
 The liaison agreed that this was a probable outcome, and 
said he was seeking a way forward that would show the ILO\'s 
concern with the situation without jeopardizing the ILO\'s 
tenuous position here.  None at the table had any specific 
ideas for how to accomplish this. 
 
Comment: The ILO\'s Good Work 
7. (SBU) We think the liaison\'s comments have merit.  ILO is 
doing important work here as the focal point for credible 
complaints about forced labor and other human rights abuses. 
We find the ILO liaison here a reliable and helpful monitor 
of labor abuses in a country where verifiable information on 
human rights abuses is hard to find.  In addition, the 
liaison\'s regular reports to his headquarters are quite frank 
and critical (compared to other UN agency reporting here). 
Enhanced ILO countermeasures would have an important symbolic 
impact but are unlikely to alter the regime\'s behavior other 
than to give those in the SPDC who find the ILO\'s presence 
irritating additional ammunition to lobby for the 
organization\'s removal.  End comment.

diplomatic note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
transmitting a congratulatory letter (unsigned) from Senior 
General Than Shwe to President Bush on the occasion of the 
latter\'s re-election.  Post will forward the original to

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Myanmar

information of the embassy a copy of the congratulatory

Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council of the 
Union of Myanmar, to the honorable George W. Bush, on the 
occasion of his re-election for the second term as the 
President of the United States of America. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Myanmar 
avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of 
the United States of America the assurances of its highest

Washington, D.C. 
 
Mr. President, 
 
On behalf of the people of the Union of Myanmar as well as on 
my own, it gives me great pleasure in extending to you, Mr. 
President, our sincere congratulations on the occasion of 
your re-election for the second term of the President of the 
United States of America. 
 
Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest 
consideration.

Chairman 
The State Peace and Development Council of the Union of 
Myanmar 
 
2.  (SBU) Comment:  The letter is an unusual gesture from the 
SPDC.  We have not received friendly correspondence on any 
occasion in recent years.  The November 6 edition of the New 
Light of Myanmar ran a front page notice about the letter to 
President Bush, stating \"Senior General Than Shwe sends 
felicitations to U.S. President - Yangon, 5 Nov - Senior 
General Than Shwe, Chairman of the SPDC of the Union of 
Myanmar, sent a congratulatory message to the Honorable 
George W. Bush, on the occasion of his re-election as the 
President of the United States of America.\"  The then-Deputy 
Foreign Minister\'s June 2004 visit to the chancery to sign 
the Reagan condolence book was the last GOB effort to reach 
out to the Embassy in any meaningful way (reftel).  However, 
we don\'t believe that Than Shwe\'s letter portends a change in 
the regime\'s bilateral posture.  Official media this week 
maintained robust coverage of the situation in Iraq with 
articles and commentary highly critical of U.S. military 
operations.  End Comment.

1. (C)  Summary:  The after-shocks from Prime Minister Khin 
Nyunt\'s recent demise again shook the ground in Rangoon over 
the weekend of November 5-7, as two influential members of 
the government--the Minister of Labor and the Minister of 
Home Affairs--were pushed off their perches.  Authorities are 
holding these two latest cabinet casualties in their homes 
during an ongoing investigation.  More regime changes are 
expected as the SPDC continues to dismantle the political and 
financial webs constructed by Khin Nyunt during his many 
years in power.  End Summary. 
 
Pace Quickens Over the Week-End 
 
2. (SBU) Following the sacking of former Prime Minister Khin 
Nyunt on October 19, Senior General Than Shwe and his deputy, 
Deputy Senior General Maung Aye, have moved deliberately to 
purge the regime of Khin Nyunt cronies and confidants.  They 
struck again on Friday evening, November 5, \"granting 
permission for retirement\" to two top ministers and four 
deputy ministers, all of whom had links to the deposed Prime 
Minister, and replaced them with faithful military men. 
 
3. (C)  The latest casualties included the Minister of Labor 
and the Minister of Home Affairs.  Like the deposed Prime 
Minister and other recently ousted officials, the two 
Ministers are reportedly confined, while under investigation, 
to their Rangoon homes.  The former Labor Minister, U Tinn 
Win, a recent Burmese Ambassador to the United States 
(1996-2001), had served concurrently as the Minister in the 
Prime Minister\'s Office.  In that capacity, he led the 
Burmese delegation to the UNGA and to ASEAN-European 
Ministerial Meeting (ASEM) in Hanoi in October.  He was a 
former Colonel in the Office of Military Intelligence, had 
served earlier as ambassador to Thailand, and as chief 
negotiator with the Wa and Kokang cease-fire groups.  He 
spoke English well and was comfortable dealing with 
foreigners (ref C reports on the Chief of Mission\'s October 
25 meeting with him). 
 
4. (SBU)  The ousted Minister of Home Affairs, Colonel Tin 
Hlaing, had been in his post since November 1997.  Former 
Prime Minister Khin Nyunt reportedly recommended him for 
promotion from Deputy Minister, a post he had held from 
1994-97.  As Home Affairs Minister, he had oversight of 
forced labor issues and, in that capacity, he issued a 1999 
directive, with minimal effect, ordering all departments to 
stop that practice.  He was also responsible for issues 
related to trafficking-in-persons (TIPs), and was the senior 
Burmese official at a recent regional conference held in 
Rangoon on that subject (ref d). 
 
5. (SBU)  The four deputy Ministers who lost their positions 
in the latest purge were from the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Irrigation (Brig Gen Khin Maung); Ministry of Industry-1 
(Brig Gen Kyaw Win); Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (U 
Aung Thein); and the Ministry of Science and Technology (U 
Nyi Hla Nge).  All had connections to the fallen Prime 
Minister and were said to have failed to meet performance 
targets for their offices. 
 
New Ministers:  True Grit 
 
6. (C) The new Minister of Home Affairs, Major General Maung 
Oo, was promoted from his current posts as Commander of the 
Western Military District (Rakhine State) and Chairman of the 
Rakhine State Peace and Development Council.  He gained 
notoriety for his oppressive military operations against 
Karen and Mon insurgents while assigned to the Southeastern 
region, 1998-2001.  While serving in Rakhine State, he was 
responsible for forced labor on government beach resorts, 
hotels, dams, and canals.  In December 2002, when Aung San 
Suu Kyi (ASSK) visited Rakhine State, he ordered the 
construction of road blocks to impede her followers and 
turned out fire trucks with water canons to break up the 
crowds. 
 
7. (SBU)  Colonel (retired) U Thaung, Minister for Science 
and Technology and Chairman of the Myanmar Investment 
Commission, will take the portfolio of Minister of Labor 
along with his current responsibilities.  Colonel U Thaung 
was a classmate of Deputy Senior General Maung Aye in the 
Burmese military academy, where he was the top student in his 
class (note:  Maung Aye was reportedly at the bottom of the 
same class. End note).  He is from the same home town 
(Kyaukse) as Senior General Than Shwe.  After preceding U 
Tinn Win as Ambassador to Washington, U Thaung became 
Minister of Industry.  In 1997, he was appointed Minister of 
Science and Technology, with responsibility for managing the 
Universities of Technology and Computer Science, along with 
other government technical institutes.  He is notorious for 
heavy-handed management and control of the schools he heads, 
as well as the students who attend them. 
8.  (SBU)  The new Deputy Minister for Science and Technology 
is U Kyaw Soe, currently Director General, Technical and 
Vocational Education Department in the same ministry.  The 
other three new deputies have yet to be named. 
 
More Fall Out Likely 
 
9.  Comment:  These changes appear to be part of a slow, but 
inexorable, tightening of the screws that hold Senior General 
Than Shwe\'s ship of state together.  Concurrent to the latest 
cabinet changes, the SPDC also released a lengthy (17-page) 
tract, in Burmese and English, detailing Prime Minister Khin 
Nyunt\'s dismissal for corruption, the point of which appeared 
to be to justify their moves to the public--both domestic and 
foreign.  The Government might well be anticipating--and 
trying to preclude--dissatisfaction with its heavy-handed 
ways, which are likely to continue as the generals continue 
to unravel the political and economic webs that Khin Nyunt 
and his cronies had developed during the 16 years they were 
riding high.

SUBJECT: A VISIT TO PROJECT OLD SOLDIER 101 
 
Classified By: CDA, a.i RONALD K. MCMULLEN FOR REASONS 1.5 (b,d) 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  INL-funded Project Old Soldier 101, a 
crop-substitution program founded by WWII veterans of OSS 
Detachment 101, appears to be doing an excellent job 
providing farmers profitable alternatives to raising opium 
poppies in the rugged hills of northeastern Burma. 
Approximately 4,000 farmers, many of whom previously planted 
opium poppies, participate in Project 101 agricultural 
training and/or farmers cooperatives.  Emboff traveled to 
this isolated region in early November, the first USG 
official to visit the project site in over five years.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) World War Two Vets Giving Back: 
 
Veterans of OSS Detachment 101, after fighting alongside 
thousands of Kachin Rangers during WWII, initiated an 
agriculture program to assist their former brothers-in-arms 
and their families in escaping the downward spiral of opium 
poppy production and drug addiction.  Since 1996 this 
projected has been funded by an INL grant to the veterans 
group and has evolved into a highly successful crop 
substitution program and agriculture extension service 
reaching thousands of hill-tribe families in northeastern 
Burma. 
 
3. (C) Stealthy Program: 
 
Project 101 formerly had an American director and a number of 
temporary American volunteer extension agents, all of whom 
were ordered out of the country by the GOB in the late 1990s. 
 Since then the program has managed to continue, even thrive, 
thanks to the stealthy organizational skills and technical 
expertise of its local director, Ms. Nang Ja.  The GOB feigns 
not to be aware of the ongoing existence of Project 101, 
although we know that a few mid-level GOB officials have 
relatives who live in the region and participate in the 
program.  Many of the Project 101 co-ops are formed by Kachin 
Baptist and Catholic congregations that provide 
organizational cover for the project,s activities. 
 
 
4. (C) Kachin Dynamo: 
 
The project,s energetic director, Nang Ja, is the daughter 
of a WWII Kachin Ranger.  She and her dedicated staff of 38 
field agents provide training and develop farmers co-ops in 
northern and northeastern Burma.  Project 101 imports 
high-yield seed corn, fertilizer, insecticide, and herbicide; 
it then provides these relatively expensive inputs to its 
trainees and sells them on a cost-recovery basis to former 
trainees who organize themselves into 20-member farmer 
cooperatives.  The project extends a revolving credit fund to 
the co-ops that allows members to purchase agricultural 
inputs in bulk, repaying the loans when the crop is harvested 
and sold. 
 
5. (U) Poppy Free Pledge: 
 
Emboff talked to many farmers who as recently as 2001 were 
raising opium poppies.  Project 101 requires a &poppy free8 
pledge from trainees and co-op members and has been a major 
factor in virtually eliminating opium poppy production from 
the project region.  Farmers claimed they could turn a 100% 
profit on the high-cost, high-yield hybrid corn imported from 
Thailand.  This bright orange corn variety is commonly 
referred to as &101 corn8 in northern Shan State and 
fetches nearly six dollars a bushel in this grain-deficient 
border region. 
 
6. (C) Post-MI, Good Timing for Visit: 
 
Post was very careful not to jeopardize the project by 
raising its profile with the GOB; Emboff requested and 
received GOB permission to travel to this sensitive border 
region to, inter alia, inspect UN-supported projects in the 
area.  Local staff members said that the timing of the 
embassy visit was fortuitous, given the (temporary?) demise 
of Military Intelligence (MI) - &we are so happy the 
informants are gone,8 said one 101 staffer.  In fact, the 
dismantling of MI structures along the Chinese border yielded 
a surprisingly relaxed border-crossing atmosphere.  In two 
different locations Emboff sauntered over to the Chinese side 
of the border, chatted with PLA officers, and returned to 
Burma without any Burmese immigration official saying a word 
or even looking at Emboff.  Burmese Customs authorities, on 
the other hand, were completely unloading scores of heavy 
cargo trucks, creating six-day backlogs at some locations. 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  Project 101 is thriving amid very difficult 
circumstances and keeping former poppy farmers from returning 
to their illegal activities.  It is doing good while doing 
well.  Besides accomplishing its counter-narcotics goals, the 
project is also helping thousands of poor farmers provide a 
better life for their families; many have a father or 
grandfather who risked life and limb to serve alongside U.S. 
troops in World War Two.  The warmth with which these old 
veterans, their children, and grandchildren greeted visiting 
Emboff was striking.  Project 101 might serve as a model for 
other programs fostering U.S. objectives in Burma - despite 
operating without official GOB sanction.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: SHAN CEASE-FIRE GROUP WARY OF GOB INTENTIONS 
 
Classified By: CDA, a.i. Ronald K. McMullen 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY:  In the course of travel to visit an 
INL-funded project in Shan State, Emboff encountered the 
leadership of the Shan State Army (SSA), a former insurgent 
group that has concluded a cease-fire agreement with the GOB. 
Shan leaders are concerned that the post-Khin Nyunt regime 
will move against the cease-fire groups and other ethnic 
minority groups in Shan State and thwart progress toward the 
Shan Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD) and SSA\'s 
stated objective of a federated, democratic Burma.  Among 
other things, the Shan leaders told Emboff the GOB intends 
\"to crush the Wa\" (i.e., the United Wa State Army - 
Burma\'s leading narcotics producers and drug traffickers). 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Encounter with SSA Leaders: 
 
Emboff stopped in Hsipaw, the former capital of a major 
princely state in northeastern Burma November 1st while 
traveling in the region.  He called on \"Donald,\" the nephew 
and heir of a powerful Shan noble abducted and killed by the 
Burmese army in its 1962 coup.  Donald is the 
\"brother/cousin\" of Hkun Htun Oo, leader of the SNLD, 
Burma\'s second largest democratic party.  He also is the 
spokesman for the Shan State Peace Council, a grouping of the 
SSA and another Shan cease-fire group.  When Emboff arrived 
at the former princely estate, East Haw, he found it guarded 
by heavily armed SSA troops sporting M-79 grenade launchers 
and a variety of assault rifles.  He was welcomed by Donald 
and his wife, and found that three other individuals, the 
political and military leaders of the 9,000-strong Shan State 
Army, were also calling at East Haw. 
 
3. (S) Regime Planning to \"Crush\" the UWSA? 
 
The Shan leaders claimed they had recently \"intercepted\" a 
regime message laying out plans to deal with the multi-ethnic 
Shan State.  First, the GOB would require cease-fire groups 
to transform themselves from ethnic militias running 
semi-autonomous regions into regular political parties. 
Second, the regime intended to \"crush the Wa.\"  Third, with 
the Wa crushed, the GOB would divide and impose its direct 
rule on the mosaic of other ethnic, military, and political 
groups in Shan State.  In reaction, the Shan leaders 
continued, the SSA and the SNLD (which often closely 
coordinate their activities) had called all Shan State groups 
to a large gathering November 3rd to see if they could find 
common ground for a joint response to the SPDC\'s supposed 
plans. 
 
4. (S) Shans Seek Help: 
 
As is often the case when traveling Emboffs meet ethic 
minority representatives, the Shan leaders asked for 
financial assistance.  They said they hoped to form a Shan 
State Consultative Committee as an outgrowth of the November 
3rd meeting, adding that they needed money for social welfare 
programs, as health and education infrastructures in Shan 
State \"had been ignored for four decades.\"  HIV/AID 
information in the Shan language was badly needed, they 
added.  One SSA leader, who attended the now-adjourned 
National Convention, said, \"If we decide not to go back to 
the National Convention when it reconvenes, we will need more 
weapons.\" 
 
5. (S) COMMENT:  There is a palpable skittishness among 
ethnic cease-fire groups in Shan State arising from fears 
that the concessions and agreements they concluded with 
former PM Khin Nyunt may no longer be honored.  The UWSA, 
with its relatively large and well-armed militia, its 
continuing close relations with the PRC, and with its coffers 
full of money from its heroin and meth business, is probably 
the key to GOB relations with ethnic minority groups in Shan 
State.  None of the ethnic Shan leaders we have spoken to, 
either in Rangoon or in Shan State, are very clear or 
optimistic about the regime\'s intentions, given the 
continuing confusion and fallout of the demise of Khin Nyunt 
and his Military Intelligence apparatus.  Post has and will 
continue to reiterate our support for a peaceful transition 
to democracy in a united Burma.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: PRO-DEMOCRACY ETHNIC PARTIES SEEK USG ASSISTANCE 
 
Classified By: CDA, a.i. Ronald McMullen for reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1. (S/NF) Hkun Htun Oo, acting in his capacity as head of the 
ten-party United Nationalities Alliance (UNA), formally 
requested USG financial assistance for UNA member parties for 
\"democracy and humanitarian affairs\" in a meeting with 
emboffs November 9th. 
 
2. (SBU) Hkun Htun Oo, besides heading the UNA, is chairman 
of Burma\'s second largest political party, the Shan 
Nationalities League for Democracy (SNLD).  The UNA\'s other 
nine members represent Chin, Mon, Kachin, Kayah, Arakanese, 
and other pro-democracy ethnic parties. 
 
3. (S/NF) The National League for Democracy, by far the 
largest of Burma\'s pro-democracy parties, has made clear it 
would not accept direct foreign support, although NLD General 
Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi, we understand, is currently 
 
SIPDIS 
pondering several potential indirect mechanisms and will be 
in touch with us by the end of November on this. 
 
4. (S/NF) COMMENT: The timing of the UNA request for direct 
USG support is not arbitrary.  The purging of General Khin 
Nyunt and the dismantling of his Military Intelligence 
apparatus represents both a risk to and an opportunity for 
the beleaguered pro-democracy ethnic political parties.  The 
risk involves the potential for a regime crackdown on 
non-Burman ethnic groups in general, including pro-democracy 
political parties and (sometimes allied) former insurgent 
groups that have negotiated cease-fires with General Khin 
Nyunt.  The opportunity arises from the perhaps temporary 
absence of an omnipotent state organ for domestic repression. 
 Bluntly put, they might be thinking, \"Khin Nyunt\'s 
informants are gone, but Maung Aye\'s troops might be more 
stringent in the future; now\'s the time to put in place some 
support mechanism for our long-suffering party and its 
members.\"  We note that support to pro-democracy groups would 
not have the regime\'s sanction.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  CAPACITY-BUILDING PROGRAM FOR RISING ETHNIC PARTY 
LEADERS 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Embassy Rangoon\'s Public Affairs Section 
(PAS) recently initiated a leadership capacity building 
program (called the \"Global English\" Program) for 23 
representatives from nine ethnic democratic political 
parties.  The program\'s nine-month curriculum, targeted at 
rising or current party leaders and modeled on the NLD- 
oriented Professional Development Program (PDP), includes 
the study of democracy and human rights, economic 
development and globalization, social indicators, gender, 
environment, and the role of international organizations. 
The \"Global English\" Program is funded through an ESF grant 
to the instructor of the PDP program. End Summary. 
 
Ethnic PDP? 
----------- 
 
2. (SBU) Recognizing both the success of the PDP program 
with rising members of the NLD and the lack of similar 
training opportunities for ethnic democratic political 
parties, Embassy Rangoon in the summer of 2004 began to 
explore the possibility of offering a PDP-style program to 
ethnic political parties extant during the 1990 elections 
and still currently dedicated to non-violent democratic 
change in Burma.  Given the USG\'s support for democratic 
reform in Burma, this program would necessarily exclude 
participation from ethnic minority-based armed opposition 
groups, whether on cease-fire or not, and those political 
parties aligned with the SPDC. 
 
3. (SBU) Dubbed the \"Global English\" Program (to enable the 
participants to blend in with the American Center\'s hundreds 
of regular English students), this initiative targets rising 
or current ethnic party leaders and will cover democracy and 
human rights, economic development and globalization, social 
indicators, gender, environment, and the role of 
international organizations, among other subjects.  In 
collaboration with PAS Rangoon, the program coordinator will 
also recruit relevant foreign experts to lecture to program 
participants.  Similar to the PDP program, the objective of 
the \"Global English\" Program is to provide rising ethnic 
leaders with the knowledge and skills to better advance 
their democratic goals in both local and international 
contexts.  The program will be funded by an ESF grant 
awarded directly to the instructor of the PDP course. 
 
Ethnic groups enthusiastic to learn 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) In early September, Embassy officers briefed 
leaders of 15 ethnic democratic political parties about the 
program.  Notably, only two of the 15 parties attending the 
briefing (the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy and 
Shan State Kokang Democratic Party) have legal standing with 
the Burmese government.  The others have been deregistered 
by the military regime.  As a result, some of the ethnic 
parties have only minimally functioning party structures. 
 
5. (SBU) The ethnic party response to Embassy solicitation 
to participate in the program was overwhelming; post 
interviewed 50 candidates from 11 ethnic democratic parties 
during late September and early October.  PAS Rangoon 
screened candidates for their potential or current 
leadership roles in their respective parties and their 
English-speaking ability.  To the extent possible given the 
sometimes minimal qualifications of individual candidates, 
we tried to ensure that each ethnic group (if not each 
ethnic political party) was represented in the program.  In 
fact, because of the strong interest in the program, PAS 
Rangoon organized two sections, dividing chosen participants 
into senior leadership and junior party member groups. 
 
6. (SBU) A total of 23 candidates from the following nine 
ethnic political parties (number of individual party 
participants in parenthesis) are currently participating in 
the \"Global English\" Program: Shan Nationalities League for 
Democracy (2); Arakan League for Democracy (4); Kachin State 
National Congress for Democracy (1); Chin National League 
for Democracy (3); Kayin (Karen) National Congress for 
Democracy (2); Mon National Democratic Front (3); National 
Democratic Party for Human Rights (Rohingya) (4); United 
Nationalities League for Democracy (mixed ethnic) (2); and 
Zomi (Chin) National Congress (2). 
 
7. (SBU) Program participants range in rank from chairman 
and general secretary to youth wing leader to general 
member.  Though PAS Rangoon actively encouraged ethnic 
parties to nominate women for the program, only three women, 
one a Muslim, are currently participating. 
 
8. (SBU) Attendees have participated enthusiastically in 
initial class sessions, which began in mid-October, and in 
fact, post continues to receive additional nominations for 
the program.  We hope that such enthusiasm continues over 
time, and that the \"Global English\" Program will avoid many 
of the participation restraints that affected NLD PDP 
students.  In that context, the October 19 removal of PM 
Khin Nyunt and the further consolidation of power by Senior 
General Than Shwe has to date had no effect on participant 
attendance to the \"Global English\" course. 
 
9. (U) In parallel with the ongoing coursework, PAS Rangoon 
plans to obtain Burmese translations of the classroom texts, 
funding this task through a separate grant mechanism.  Such 
translations would allow for even greater dissemination of 
the program\'s substantive content.

1. (C) Summary:  In an apparent campaign to smear former 
Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt and in the process diminish 
the authority of the military intelligence (MI) apparatus 
that he created and controlled, the SPDC on November 7 
published a stunning \"explanation\" of his recent ouster. 
Gone is an initial regime veneer that subscribed \"health 
reasons\" behind Khin Nyunt\'s departure, replaced by a 
vitriolic attack describing the junta\'s former third-ranking 
member as \"culpable,\" \"corrupt,\" and \"insubordinate.\" 
 
2. (C) Rather than corruption, however, we suspect that a 
more probable explanation for the SPDC\'s anti-Khin Nyunt 
campaign is a long-standing hatred, and fear, associated with 
an MI apparatus that knew no limits and focused attention not 
only on overt threats to the status quo, but also on the 
regime itself.  Nonetheless, although MI was clearly an 
irritant to many senior officials, the intelligence network 
more often than not delivered the goods and served as the 
regime\'s backbone for command and control of Burma\'s diverse 
population.  We suspect that MI will survive, in some shape 
or form, to continue playing a key role for the SPDC.  End 
Summary. 
 
Sunday - Laundry Day for the Regime 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) In a stunning 18-page expose, the SPDC on Sunday 
November 7 issued a self-described \"complete explanation\" of 
events related to the October 19 ouster of former Prime 
Minister Khin Nyunt.  The \"explanation,\" issued as a special 
insert to the regime\'s official newspaper (the New Light of 
Myanmar), was a compilation of internal briefings offered to 
government and military officials in late October and early 
November.  According to the regime, the briefings were given 
by SPDC member General Thura Shwe Mann, Prime Minister Lt Gen 
Soe Win, and Secretary-1 Lt Gen Thein Sein and issued 
publicly \"with a view to hav(ing) the complete story 
regarding the developments in the country.\" 
 
4. (C) On several occasions since SPDC Chairman Than Shwe\'s 
declaration that he had permitted Khin Nyunt \"to retire on 
health grounds,\" GOB and SPDC officials have alluded to 
allegations of corruption as a possible reason for the former 
Prime Minister\'s demise.  Most notably, on October 21 during 
a briefing for the diplomatic corps, Foreign Minister U Nyan 
Win linked Khin Nyunt to a $30 million corruption scheme (ref 
C).  During a private meeting with the COM on October 25, the 
Minister of Labor (ref B) said that Khin Nyunt was \"covered 
with rust\" and should have been dismissed earlier (Note: The 
Labor Minister, who had close ties to Khin Nyunt, was himself 
sacked less than two weeks later - ref A.  End Note). 
 
5. (U) The SPDC\'s November 7 official explanation of events 
dropped all pretext of medical reasons for Khin Nyunt\'s 
departure, saying that such a description was initially 
offered \"out of regard for his dignity and that of his 
family.\"  Instead, the briefers, led by General Shwe Mann, 
unleashed a volley of accusations describing General Khin 
Nyunt as \"culpable,\" \"insubordinate,\" and deeply involved in 
bribery and corruption.  Among the highlights of Shwe Mann\'s 
briefings: 
 
--While Khin Nyunt was undergoing medical treatment in 
Singapore in mid-September, a \"huge and alarming bribery and 
corruption case\" was uncovered at a border checkpoint near 
Muse, close to the China border in northern Shan State (ref 
D), involving over $30 million in cash, 42 tons of jade, and 
1,300 pearls.  According to Shwe Mann, a \"dutiful citizen\" 
had issued a report on the corruption to Khin Nyunt, but the 
latter neglected to inform SPDC authorities. 
 
--Thus far, the regime has arrested and convicted 186 
personnel from the military and three civil departments for 
their involvement in the Muse case and disbanded the National 
Intelligence Board (which, under Khin Nyunt\'s authority, had 
oversight of military intelligence). 
--The Muse case, which exacerbated existing tensions between 
military intelligence units and immigration units, also 
revealed that MI (under Khin Nyunt\'s command) had been 
\"high-handed\" in its dealings with ordinary citizens and 
civil servants. 
 
--On October 1, Army Chief Vice Senior General issued a 
directive to all government and military departments to cease 
economic ventures disguised as \"welfare\" activities raising 
funds for civil servants.  General Khin Nyunt was \"deeply 
aggrieved\" by the directive, which resulted in SPDC Chairman 
Than Shwe warning him on October 4 that he, the Chairman, 
planned to relieve the Prime Minister of his MI portfolio. 
 
--On October 14, Khin Nyunt told his OCMI lieutenants that 
the situation had devolved due to a \"lack of unity\" among 
military units, and he issued instructions for intelligence 
gathering on regional and brigade military commanders. 
 
--Citing Khin Nyunt\'s October 14 instructions as \"not only 
leading to the disintegration of the Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) 
but also posing a serious threat to the nation,\" Shwe Mann\'s 
briefings concluded that the former Prime Minister was 
permitted to retire on October 19. 
 
Extortion?  We\'re Shocked, Just Shocked 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The SPDC\'s explanations also revealed that Shwe Mann 
and Prime Minister Soe Win had met with business leaders 
subsequent to Khin Nyunt\'s dismissal to \"give necessary 
instructions.\"   Soe Winn, explaining that the regime\'s 
economic development successes were not achieved solely under 
the direction of one individual (e.g., Khin Nyunt), 
admonished the entrepreneurs to avoid creating a \"new class 
that benefits... a minority of the people\" and to steer clear 
of corruption and bribery.  (Note: S-1 Lt Gen Thein Sein, in 
his capacity as Chairman of the National Convention Convening 
Commission, also explained that the regime\'s road map was not 
the product of \"a single individual,\" but rather the entire 
SPDC.  End Note.) 
 
7. (U) General Shwe Mann told the business leaders, 
apparently with a straight face, that \"we come to know only 
now\" that military intelligence officers had employed 
strong-arm tactics with the commercial sector, noting that 
\"if they (MI commanders) need money, all they need to do is 
to summon the entrepreneurs and interrogate them.\"  Shwe Mann 
assured the business leaders that the SPDC had placed MI \"in 
its bounds\" in order to prevent further corrupt practices. 
 
8. (U) However, Shwe Mann also gave a clear warning to 
operators who may have had business deals with Khin Nyunt, 
his family, and/or his cronies, urging entrepreneurs to write 
as soon as possible to the new chief of military 
intelligence, Maj Gen Myint Swe, and confess their past 
\"donations\" to MI officers and avoid \"unnecessary 
interrogations.\"  He added, \"if, on the other hand (your 
deals are) revealed upon interrogation, you will be held 
responsible.\"  He observed that interrogations had already 
exposed information on joint ventures between OCMI (Khin 
Nyunt\'s Office of the Chief of Military Intelligence) and the 
\"Tun Lin Yaung Company,\" but offered no further details. 
 
Comment: MI Down, but Not Out for the Count 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) A mere two days elapsed before the SPDC began to 
remove its thin veneer of a dignified departure for Khin 
Nyunt and to blame the former Prime Minister for many of the 
country\'s ills.  The November 7 \"explanations,\" a public 
airing of internal conflict and decision-making without 
precedence under the current regime, are a stunning admission 
that Khin Nyunt almost single-handedly split the armed forces 
and threatened to undermine the regime.  True or not, the 
SPDC has felt compelled to undertake a massive effort, 
apparently launched just prior to Khin Nyunt\'s actual ouster 
(ref E), to purge the military and government of his 
influence.  Authorities have cast a very wide net and in 
recent weeks hundreds upon hundreds of Khin Nyunt\'s family 
members, cronies, associates, and subordinates have 
disappeared--subject to dismissal, arrest, interrogation, 
detention, and/or imprisonment. 
 
10. (C)  So what is behind the vitriol suddenly directed at 
Khin Nyunt, by all accounts a teetotaler workaholic who was 
faithful to the regime cause and, by the low standards of 
dictatorial rule, relatively limited in his excesses?  There 
is no question that \"resource allocation\" and competition 
among various military units for economic gains were sources 
of serious friction within the Tatmadaw, and perhaps even the 
SPDC itself.  However, the regime\'s feigned shock at Khin 
Nyunt\'s corrupt practices are laughable, given the vast 
amounts of \"tea money\" that regularly exchange hands at all 
levels of Burmese society and the regime\'s own use of 
corruption to extend and maintain its authority. 
 
11. (C) A more probable explanation for the SPDC\'s feast upon 
the carcass of what was once a Khin Nyunt empire is the 
long-standing hatred, and fear, associated with his military 
intelligence apparatus.  MI knew no limits and, with its 
Stasi-like oversight and powers, focused attention not only 
dissenters, insurgents, and other overt threats to the status 
quo, but also on the regime itself.  Khin Nyunt\'s purported 
October 14 instructions for his MI officers to probe the 
SPDC\'s powerful regional commanders may have been the straw 
that broke the camel\'s back, leading to his ouster and 
providing cover for a vengeful blow directed at military 
intelligence. 
 
12. (C) The ongoing purge may be short-lived, however.  MI 
was clearly an irritant to many, but the intelligence network 
more often than not delivered the goods and served as the 
regime\'s backbone for command and control of Burma\'s diverse 
population.  The SPDC will likely, for the sake of its 
continued survival, establish some new or modified 
organization to carry out the nefarious activities of Khin 
Nyunt\'s MI.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: Burma\'s generals are pushing to develop an IT 
and software sector well beyond the country\'s needs and 
abilities.  Though a side effect of this effort has been 
improved communications and expanded access of some Burmese 
to the Internet, too many basic problems remain for this 
campaign to result in the success envisioned by the SPDC.  We 
view the push for an IT sector as nothing more than a 
prestige project undertaken, with encouragement and support 
by Burma\'s Asian neighbors, at the expense of other more 
rational economic development priorities.  End summary. 
 
Burma\'s Long History of IT 
 
2. (U) Though Burma is a true technological backwater, it has 
a tradition of computer science that stretches back to 1970 
when the United Nations funded the Rangoon University 
Computer Center Project.  Burma\'s first IT development law, 
which formed the Computer Science Development Council (CSDC) 
chaired by the recently ousted Prime Minister General Khin 
Nyunt, was implemented in 1996.  In 1998, the Myanmar 
Computer Federation (MCF) and its four sub-groups were formed 
by the GOB to carry out the development directives formulated 
by the CSDC.  In 2000, the CSDC and MCF \"agreed\" on a 
six-part \"Master Plan,\" which is ongoing. 
 
3. (SBU) Since 2000, the IT sector has benefited from 
generous overseas assistance and full-fledged SPDC support 
(though this may waver somewhat with the demise of the 
original IT champion Khin Nyunt).  Khin Nyunt\'s son Ye Naing 
Win formed Bagan Cybertech, the country\'s first data 
communication firm and only \"private\" sector ISP, in 2000. 
Ye Naing Win was removed from his position when his father 
went down in October and the military took over Bagan 
Cybertech, which continues to operate the country\'s only 
Internet Data Centers and teleports, located in Rangoon and 
Mandalay, and has the contract with Thai-based iPSTAR to 
offer satellite voice and data communications throughout the 
country.  We\'ve heard rumors that with the removal of Ye 
Naing Win, children and close cronies of SPDC Senior General 
Than Shwe may soon get into the IT services business. 
 
The Infrastructure Expands 
 
4. (SBU) In contrast to many other GOB \"master plans,\" the IT 
plan is in part being implemented.  Bagan Cybertech and 
state-owned Myanmar Post and Telecommunications (MPT) are 
building the country\'s Internet \"backbone,\" linking Rangoon 
and Mandalay with fiber in 2003 and now working to link 
Rangoon and various provincial capitals as well.  The country 
is also linked to an international submarine cable, which is 
in turn linked by fiber to Rangoon.  The \"last mile\" 
infrastructure is also improving, with Bagan Cybertech now 
offering Broadband Wireless Local Loop and ADSL connections 
to the very tiny minority who can afford it.  These broadband 
services cost around 500,000 kyat (about $525 at market 
rates) for set up and from 30,000 to 120,000 kyat ($32 to 
$126) per month depending on bandwidth usage.  Bagan 
Cybertech also offers regular dial-up email and Internet 
services to anyone for between 8,000 kyat and 28,000 kyat 
($8.40 and $30) per month.  For reference, the break-even 
income point for a family of five is roughly 35,000 kyat ($37 
at market rates) per month. 
 
5. (SBU) Computer industry officials admit that this new 
\"last mile\" infrastructure often looks better on paper than 
in reality.  All of Burma\'s local telephone connections from 
exchanges to homes are made of ancient copper wiring which 
often makes it impossible to take full advantage of ADSL. 
However, one official claimed, MPT has linked exchanges with 
fiber, and would start linking the exchanges to homes \"in 
time.\" 
 
6. (SBU) To circumvent these \"last mile\" problems, as well as 
the lack of any telephony infrastructure in most of the 
country, Bagan Cybertech and Thailand\'s Shin Satellite signed 
a $13 million contract in 2002 to provide wireless voice and 
data broadband communication services countrywide (ref A). 
Shin Satellite\'s iPSTAR system is being marketed through 
Bagan Cybertech, which charges users from 3 million to 4.9 
million kyat ($3,150 to $5,160 depending on antenna size) in 
set-up and activation fees, then 60,000 kyat ($63) per year, 
and from 30,000 kyat to 400,000 kyat ($32 to $420) per month 
depending on bandwidth usage, and the number of email and 
voice channels (all monitored by the GOB) required.  Though 
this is an outlandish sum by local standards, in remote towns 
populated by some wealthy individuals (such as near the Thai 
and Chinese borders or in mining regions) \"public\" iPSTAR 
phone and Internet outlets are a rather common site -- though 
international calls via iPSTAR phones are blocked.  A Bagan 
Cybertech official said there were around 1,000 iPSTAR 
customers with many multiples of that using the services. 
 
7. (SBU) Such rapid expansion of the IT infrastructure in 
Burma is due in large part to the largesse of its neighbors. 
According to one computer industry official, the governments 
of China, India, Korea, and Thailand have given the most 
assistance with China providing $200 million in grants and 
concessional loans while Korea and India have forked over 
about $10 million each.  The source said that Japanese 
investors regularly come to Burma seeking investment 
opportunities in the sector as well (though few if any have 
sunk any money). 
 
Challenging India? 
 
8. (SBU) Another part of Burma\'s IT plan is to develop IT 
education and software development sectors to compete with 
India\'s.  This is clearly pie in the sky at the moment 
considering Burma\'s gutted education system and a chronic 
lack of resources from foreign or domestic investors -- due 
to Burma\'s abysmal investment and political climate. 
Nonetheless, the GOB has spent significant resources, 
augmented by aid from a number of Asian countries and 
educational exchanges with Japan and Korea, to establish 27 
IT training schools and colleges across the country.  The GOB 
has set the arbitrary goal of graduating 5,000 IT 
professionals per year by 2006.  Likewise, private sector 
computer training programs are booming as the decrepit 
economy forces educated people to upgrade their skills for a 
chance at a job. 
 
9. (C) Computer industry sources mock the GOB\'s dream as 
typical of the SPDC\'s cart-before-horse mentality.  The GOB\'s 
IT education programs are shells, erected haphazardly by the 
GOB to \"fulfill\" its objectives, which churn out 
ill-qualified engineers and software developers with no 
practical experience.  However, the few engineers trained 
overseas in Japan return well-qualified to work for Bagan 
Cybertech or at private software firms.  Efforts to create an 
instant software sector are also stymied by poor quality 
standards (Burma has no ISO or CMMI certified firms) and 
blatant disregard and/or ignorance of IPR standards.  A top 
MCF official told us openly that few software firms in Burma 
use licensed software because of expense and poor 
understanding of the importance of protecting intellectual 
property. 
 
10. (SBU) Nonetheless, there are some minor success stories. 
A tiny handful of local firms have received small contracts 
or sub-contracts (worth no more than $3,000) to work on 
software programs for developers in India, Thailand, Japan, 
and Malaysia.  One software developer claimed as well that 
one or two Burmese firms could meet international quality 
assurance standards, though they lack the funds to go through 
the certification process. 
 
The Picture is Not So Bright 
 
11. (C) Despite some progress, particularly on Internet 
infrastructure and access, there are many structural and 
policy barriers that make a mockery to some degree of Burma\'s 
IT \"revolution.\"  First is a sore lack of investment.  Bagan 
Cybertech and other members of the MCF constructed in 2002 
the Myanmar Information Communications Technology (MICT) park 
in Rangoon.  MICT park, which now has a branch in Mandalay, 
is heralded in the local media as Burma\'s IT \"hub,\" the 
center of innovation and a magnet for domestic and 
international IT investment.  However, it has not worked out 
that way.  According to one senior MCF official MICT park is 
\"being hollowed out\" with four of five opening day foreign 
investors in 2002 already gone.  The park has also lost 20 
percent of its initial domestic occupants.  With the recent 
changes in leadership, we will see if MICT park (identified 
with Khin Nyunt and MI) survives or is squeezed out by a new 
competitor. 
 
12. (SBU) The lack of investment is due to the GOB\'s 
un-friendly economic policies and the complete destruction of 
local industries that would consume domestically produced IT 
products.  The software sector here initially got a boost in 
the late 1990s with the expansion of the private banking and 
export-oriented garment sectors.  With both of these sectors 
now defunct due to GOB policies and U.S. economic sanctions, 
the domestic market for software has dropped to nearly zero. 
 
13. (SBU) Another structural problem is the widespread lack 
of electricity, particularly outside Rangoon.  Irregular 
electricity supply makes it difficult to make any real 
progress in expanding access to computers and the Internet 
outside Rangoon.  We visited a gleaming new \"E-Library\" in a 
suburb of Rangoon to find several computers at the ready, but 
useless for lack of juice.  Despite this obvious hole, 
providing additional electricity is nowhere to be found in 
the IT master plan. 
 
14. (SBU) Ongoing government censorship of the Internet and 
email monitoring also contradict the GOB\'s alleged desire to 
educate the masses about IT and the Internet.  A Science and 
Technology Ministry official told us that the people would be 
given access to the Internet only after they\'d learned to use 
it \"responsibly.\"  The government blocks many Internet sites, 
including anti-SPDC sites as well as free mail sites like 
Yahoo! and Hotmail.  We\'ve learned, however, from trusted 
industry sources that Bagan Cybertech (and thus the GOB) has 
loosened noticeably its screening of emails and scrutinizing 
of applications for Internet access.  In the former case, a 
huge increase in email volume has made it impossible for 
authorities to do much beyond screen for seditious words.  In 
the latter case, Bagan Cybertech is now offering pre-paid 
Internet cards for sale with no registration necessary, and 
Internet cafes (official and otherwise) are popping up all 
over town.  A Bagan Cybertech official said there are 30,000 
subscribers to the company\'s various services.  However, 
another industry source said that for each corporate 
subscription there were at least 10 users while for every 
private subscription there were at least three or four users. 
 
Comment: Does it Make Sense? 
 
15. (C) There have been positive steps in recent years toward 
more liberalized, though expensive and still censored, access 
to the Internet -- particularly in Rangoon.  However, it is 
difficult to justify the GOB\'s spending of vast sums on 
developing a \"modern\" IT sector in a country whose government 
practices censorship and is suspicious of its own peoples\' 
contact with the outside world and that is so backward 
economically.  The IT campaign is primarily for prestige and 
the GOB has done nothing to develop other more rational 
industries.  It has in fact allowed some of Burma\'s most 
promising private sectors (banking, garments, agriculture) to 
languish or die.  It is unfortunate that Burma\'s neighbors 
\"enable\" Burma\'s ruling generals\' grandiose vision instead of 
urging them to be more pragmatic in their economic and 
political development efforts.  End comment.

1. (C)  Summary:  A small explosion occurred early November 
18 near the Rangoon district court.  No one was hurt, making 
this incident reminiscent of the June 26 explosion at the 
Rangoon railway station (reftel).  It appears the government 
is  trying to justify tightened security measures as more 
post-Khin Nyunt purges go on behind closed doors.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  A probable small improvised explosive device (IED) 
exploded at 0400 hours, November 18, near the Rangoon Western 
district court.  No one was reported injured, and damages 
were limited to two windows and a small portion of the base 
of a wall.  Authorities repaired the windows by mid-morning. 
Security was beefed up with police and members of the Union 
Solidarity Development Association (USDA) around the court. 
Court cases continued as usual.  However, security checks 
were tightened at the court\'s entrance, which is located one 
block behind the Embassy. 
 
3.  (SBU)  This is the second small IED that has exploded in 
Rangoon this year with no casualties: four IEDs exploded at 
the Rangoon Central Railway Station on June 26 but no one was 
reported hurt then either.  There was also a small explosion 
reported on October 6 along the Thai-Burma border at 
Myawaddy; and another on November 3 at a village  festival in 
Mon State. 
 
4.  (SBU)  The explosion this morning in Rangoon took place 
two days after the reported removal from office of twelve 
High or Supreme Court judges from Rangoon and Mandalay, 
including the forced retirement of a Supreme Court Justice, U 
Tun Shin.  The latter was charged under the Emergency 
Provision Act and remanded at court.  He was in deposed Prime 
Minister Khin Nyunt\'s National Intelligence Bureau before he 
was promoted to the bench.  We also understand that Colonel 
San Pwint, previously in the Office of Military Intelligence 
(MI) under Khin Nyunt and one of the officials responsible 
for negotiations with ethnic groups, has been under 
interrogation in the district court. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment:  This appears to be a case of 
self-provocation by the government to justify tightened 
security.  If instigated by someone with more serious intent, 
the bomb would have likely been detonated during the middle 
of the day in a crowded location.  End Comment.

Classified By: CDA a.i Ronald K. McMullen for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Citing \"irregularities\" of deposed Prime 
Minister Khin Nyunt\'s recently disbanded National 
Intelligence Bureau (NIB), the Burmese regime commenced on 
November 18-19 to release nearly 4,000 prisoners, including 
an unknown number of political detainees.  Although some 
observers speculate that the regime\'s move is an attempt to 
improve its standing with the international community, the 
SPDC is more likely focused on the domestic political scene. 
Criticism of the NIB is yet another assault on Khin Nyunt and 
the next step in an ongoing campaign to blame the country\'s 
ills on the former Prime Minister.  We see no signs that the 
gesture to release prisoners represents a fundamental change 
in the regime\'s posture toward the democratic opposition. 
The NLD does not have immediate expectations that the prison 
release will include party leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and U Tin 
Oo.  See para 11 for press guidance recommendations.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) In a brief statement issued on November 18, the SPDC 
announced that it had suspended the prison terms of 3,937 
\"convicts,\" with plans to release all of them from their 
respective prisons.  The announcement referenced an October 
22 order issued by SPDC Chairman Than Shwe dissolving the 
National Intelligence Bureau (NIB) (ref A) and \"observed\" 
that investigations had revealed the NIB may have committed 
\"irregularities,\" presumably associated with the arrest and 
imprisonment of thousands of Burmese individuals over the 
past 16 years. 
 
3. (SBU) The prison release list, which the regime has not 
made publicly available, includes at least some, if not many, 
of Burma\'s estimated 1,400 political prisoners, the majority 
of whom were originally rounded up by agents from the Office 
of the Chief of Military Intelligence (OCMI, known simply as 
\"MI.\").  MI dominated the NIB, an inter-departmental entity 
that coordinated the activities of four regime intelligence 
and investigative units and the entire MI apparatus has been 
the target of a massive purge underway since the October 19 
ouster of former OCMI chief, and Prime Minister, General Khin 
Nyunt (ref B). 
 
4. (U) It is uncertain how many of Burma\'s political 
prisoners will be affected by the massive release.  NIB 
detainees include not only \"traditional\" political prisoners 
such as political party members and student activists, but 
also armed insurgents and other ethnic minorities; 
perpetrators of politically motivated violent acts; violators 
of immigration law; and many white-collar criminals. 
Although prison authorities may assist some released 
prisoners with transportation, it is likely that many will 
have to fend for themselves and it could, therefore, take 
days or weeks to learn the fate of prisoners held in many 
remote locations.  Burma\'s total prison population is 
unknown, but is reported to be in the tens of thousands. 
 
5. (SBU) On November 19, Embassy sources indicated that 
officials at several of the 45 known regime prisons 
throughout Burma had already begun to release prisoners in 
accordance with SPDC instructions.  Among those observed 
departing prisons or reported to have joined their families 
at home were the following well-known political prisoners, 
several of whom have been the object of international 
campaigns seeking their release (Note: One source claimed 
that Min Ko Naing, a student leader during the 1988 
pro-democracy movement and perhaps the most well-known of 
Burma\'s political prisoners, had been released from prison in 
Rakhine State, but this could not be confirmed by COB.  End 
note). 
 
From Insein Prison (Rangoon): 
--U Win Tin, a famous 75 year-old journalist and founding NLD 
member from Rangoon (imprisoned since 1989); 
--U Kyaw Sann (Hsan), NLD MP-elect from Sagaing (since 1998); 
--U Ohn Maung, NLD MP-elect from Bago (1998); 
--U Toe Po, NLD MP-elect from Thanintharyi (1998); 
--Dr. May Win Myint, female NLD MP-elect from Rangoon (1997); 
--U Aung Zin, NLD member from Lashio; 
--U Htwe Myint, journalist and leader of the \"Democracy 
Party\" from Rangoon (1995). 
 
From Swebo Prison (Sagaing): 
--U Khun Sai, NLD supporter. 
 
From Thayet Prison (Magwe): 
--U Nyan Hla, NLD member from Rangoon. 
--Min Zaw Thein, youth activist from Rangoon. 
 
6. (SBU) On November 19, Emboffs visited Insein Prison in 
northern Rangoon, Burma\'s most notorious destination for 
political prisoners.  A crowd of 150-200 family members and 
political party supporters were gathered at the prison 
entrance, waiting with hope and anticipation that their loved 
ones would be among those released.  Witnesses confirmed that 
prison authorities had already released dozens of political 
prisoners, as well as numerous common criminals, and were 
expected to release some 1,000 prisoners by the end of the 
day.  The release operation was orderly, but prison officials 
were noticeably tense and vigorously questioned Emboffs, 
insisting they cease taking photographs at the scene. 
 
7. (C) We also spoke briefly with NLD Secretary U Lwin, who 
was pleased about the prison releases but had no immediate 
expectation that the SPDC would release party leaders ASSK or 
U Tin Oo anytime soon.  He observed that the general prison 
release was a step in the right direction, but \"only a first 
step\" that does not address the larger issues of political 
dialogue and reconciliation.  U Lwin opined that the regime 
had ordered the releases not as a goodwill gesture, but 
rather as a malicious action directed at military 
intelligence. 
 
Comment:  Not the Strategic Move It Appears to Be 
 
8. (U) Burmese leaders have a long tradition of periodically 
offering amnesty for prisoners, usually as a means of gaining 
religious merit in this predominantly-Buddhist culture or in 
order to curry political favor with one segment or another of 
this diverse and fractious country.  The current regime is no 
exception, having released large numbers of prisoners, 
including political detainees, on several occasions in the 
1990s.  However, the November 18 announcement, if fully 
implemented, is without precedent in its scale and apparent 
scope. 
 
9. (C) International observers are likely to speculate that 
the Burmese regime has undertaken this massive prison release 
in a calculated move to soften potential criticism at the 
ongoing International Labor Organization Governing Body 
meeting in Geneva and at the upcoming ASEAN Summit in 
Vientiane.  However, from our perspective, the SPDC is purely 
motivated by the domestic political situation.  Citing 
\"irregularities\" of the National Intelligence Bureau is yet 
another frontal assault on Khin Nyunt and the next step in an 
ongoing campaign to blame the country\'s ills on the former 
Prime Minister and his expansive empire, which included his 
once-powerful military intelligence network as well as broad 
commercial interests. 
 
10. (C) It would not appear that the gesture to release 
prisoners represents by any means a change in the regime\'s 
posture toward the democratic opposition or dissenters in 
general.  To the contrary, harassment of opposition 
supporters has continued in recent months (ref C), including 
the arrest on November 5 of three NLD members in Irrawaddy 
Division for possession of party position papers on education 
and health.  End Comment. 
 
Recommended Press Guidance 
 
11. (SBU) We recommend the Department welcome the inclusion 
political prisoners among the general prisoner release, with 
several important caveats:  for this step to have genuine 
meaning, all of Burma\'s political prisoners and detainees 
must be released, including ASSK and U Tin Oo as well as 
recently arrested pro-democracy activists; the SPDC must 
cease the arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention of 
individuals for their peaceful political activities; the 
regime must improve its overall human rights record, in 
particular by allowing and improving freedoms of association 
and speech; and, substantive political and economic progress 
in Burma will not be achieved unless the SPDC fosters a 
meaningful and fully inclusive political dialogue aimed at a 
genuine transition to democracy.  End recommendations for 
press guidance.

U.S. mission residence, the recently released activist 
expressed deep gratitude for support from the United States 
during, and prior to, his incarceration.  As if emerging from 
a deep freeze after 15 years of virtual isolation, he was 
amazed to learn about political and technological 
developments since his 1989 arrest.  For example, he 
expressed disbelief over a digital camera and our ability to 
e-mail his photo that night to friends and supporters outside 
of the country and surprise that Senator John Kerry had 
visited Burma in 1999.  He was also delighted to learn about 
U.S. sanctions and other forms of pressure applied on the 
regime over the past decade. 
 
4. (SBU) Min Ko Naing inquired about U.S. Embassy staff and 
friends with whom contact was severed in 1989, most notably 
the last U.S. Ambassador to Burma, Burton Levin (1987-1990). 
He asked for information on supporters from Congress, 
including former U.S. representatives Stephen Solarz (whom he 
had met in 1988) and Bill Richardson (who visited Min Ko 
Naing at Insein Prison twice during the early 1990s).  He 
also inquired about the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and was 
saddened to learn that the former Senator had passed away in 
2003. 
 
The Conqueror of Kings 
---------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Min Ko Naing (\"Conqueror of Kings,\" a nickname 
earned during 1988 student marches) demonstrated a remarkable 
memory and recalled that the Burmese regime (the then-SLORC) 
had arrested him on March 23, 1989 and sentenced him in 1991 
to 15 years in prison.  In 1993, as part of a broader amnesty 
for political prisoners, the regime reduced his sentence to 
10 years.  On the basis of provisions in the existing penal 
code, he should have been released for good behavior on July 
20, 1999.  However, prison authorities cruelly informed him 
when that date arrived that he was subject to security 
provisions of the law and would be held indefinitely. 
 
6. (SBU) On November 16, 2004, Min Ko Naing learned from the 
Sittwe prison director that his imminent release was a 
distinct possibility.  The director, who rarely visited the 
political ward, told Min Ko Naing on that day that there had 
been significant changes in the Burmese government:  \"We are 
at a turning point and the current situation is good for 
you.\"  However, the political activist had learned the hard 
way about dashed hopes and refused to believe the prison 
director until November 19, when he was whisked from the 
Sittwe prison for a one-hour flight to Rangoon and freedom. 
 
7. (SBU) Min Ko Naing--who spoke to us primarily in Burmese, 
apologizing that he had had no opportunity in prison to 
practice his English--said that prison authorities has issued 
him an \"unconditional release.\"  Unlike other releases of 
political prisoners in the past, the GOB did not require him 
to sign a confession or agree to limits on his movements or 
activities.  \"I cannot explain why they released me,\" he 
said, \"nor do I know how they will treat me from this point 
on.\"  He added that o/a November 19 the Sittwe prison 
released a total of about 30 \"regular\" prisoners who had 
already completed their sentences, but freed none of the 
other handful of political detainees. 
 
Ten Years of Solitude 
--------------------- 
 
8. (C) Min Ko Naing said he spent the first nine years of his 
imprisonment at Rangoon\'s infamous Insein Prison.  He 
described these years as the most difficult of his long 
sojourn in the gulag, as he spent most of his time in 
solitary confinement within a so-called \"special ward\" for 
political prisoners.  Military intelligence agents, disguised 
in prison guard uniforms, were assigned to monitor the 
special ward where they prohibited the political prisoners 
from doing anything without MI permission - including 
talking, reading, and writing. 
 
9. (C) In late May 1998, the regime transferred Min Ko Naing 
from Rangoon to Sittwe, another notorious prison located in 
the capital of Rakhine State, near Burma\'s western border 
with Bangladesh.  He said that although prison conditions 
were deplorable, authorities treated the political prisoners 
relatively better than at Insein Prison.  Still, he faced 
considerable hardship.  The Sittwe prison is located more 
than 400 miles from Rangoon (at least two days overland) and 
family members were only allowed to travel and visit him 
twice a year.  He again spent significant time in solitary 
confinement (ten out of the combined fifteen years he was 
jailed at Insein and Sittwe).  However, he added that ICRC 
representatives were able to visit him periodically and that 
such visits \"always helped improve conditions,\" as well as 
his morale. 
 
10. (SBU) For the duration of his imprisonment, Min Ko Naing 
said that health care was \"essentially non-existent.\" 
Neither prison medics nor janitors were allowed regular 
access to the \"special wards\" for political prisoners, and 
during several bouts of illness Min Ko Naing said he was 
confined to his cell where had to sleep among his own vomit 
and feces. 
 
A Little Help From Another Fourth Class Citizen 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
11. (C) Minimally sympathetic prison guards in Sittwe 
assigned a regular prisoner to assist Min Ko Naing in keeping 
his cell clean.  He said that they had purposefully selected 
an ethnic Rohingya prisoner, jailed on immigration charges, 
who did not speak Burmese \"in order to keep me isolated from 
outside news.\"  However, Min Ko Naing said he \"fooled\" his 
jailers by learning Bengali with the Rohingya prisoner, from 
whom he able to glean an occasional scrap of news about 
Burmese and world events (prison authorities later punished 
his guards for \"allowing\" him to learn Bengali). 
Nonetheless, he said that the Rohingya prisoner, as well as 
friendly prison personnel, had very little education and as a 
result were not able to pass on accurate political news or 
analysis.  He sporadically received tiny notes smuggled in 
from friends and supporters, but in general he described a 
15-year period mostly devoid of news. 
 
12. (SBU) Min Ko Naing offered that the years of solitude had 
taken a tremendous toll on his mental health.  In his last 
few years at Sittwe, he was allowed to spend half an hour 
daily in a communal bath area and also had occasional access 
to the prison\'s death row compound (inhabited primarily by 
ethnic Rohingyas).  During these brief encounters with fellow 
prisoners, he said he had significant difficulty 
communicating and making himself understood, causing him to 
doubt his mental capacities.  He further observed that a 
deterioration in his mental health had led to a number of 
physical problems. 
 
13. (C) Min Ko Naing declined to comment whether he had been 
tortured in prison.  However, during our encounter he showed 
signs of some eye damage and hearing loss.  He also revealed 
that preliminary results from a physical exam on November 22 
indicated heart problems that will require drug treatment. 
While he had some difficulty responding to open-ended 
questions, he was quite confident and relaxed and 
demonstrated keen political insight.  He was also disarmingly 
witty, reflecting on several of his darker moments with 
humorous anecdotes.  He noted that when prisoners were 
feeling particularly depressed about conditions or the 
prospects for release, they would declare with bitter irony 
that \"All will be better when Razali arrives,\" observing that 
the U.N. Special Envoy (and his predecessors) were rarely 
allowed to visit Burma and, when they did, were unsuccessful 
in making any progress. 
 
14. (C) As for his future plans, Min Ko Naing said 
understandably that he will take the time necessary to heal 
his physical and mental wounds.  Given uncertainties about 
the SPDC\'s posture toward recently released political 
prisoners, he said he would keep a low profile for the 
foreseeable future.  However, Min Ko Naing added, he is keen 
to keep in touch with the U.S. Embassy and will soon make a 
return visit to our American Center and its library holdings, 
where he said he gained important information and inspiration 
when he was a university student in the 1980s. 
 
A Profile in Courage 
-------------------- 
 
15. (SBU) Comment: Min Ko Naing once published a poem titled 
\"Faith,\" that read in part: \"In this unfinished revolution; 
Should my soul be gripped with fear, be hesitant and lack 
courage; Let your souls enter into mine and steer me along.\" 
He is clearly grateful for the help and support he received 
from the United States and others over the years, and yet we 
saw no signs that fear had conquered this remarkable man. 
Min Ko Naing\'s enormous personal sacrifice--in pursuit of a 
peaceful transition to democracy in Burma and improved human 
rights for his fellow citizens--is one of many stirring 
examples of what U.S. Burma policy is all about.  End Comment.

Classified By: COM CARMEN MARTINEZ FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Since former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt was 
ousted in mid-October, the SPDC has been striking at areas of 
economic graft formerly controlled by him and his Military 
Intelligence (MI) apparatus.  One of the most visible 
crackdowns is on the illegal import of cars from Thailand and 
China, something MI controlled for years.  Though the aim of 
the regime is to punish MI, such importing was also a 
lucrative business for ethnic cease-fire groups.  Thus the 
military runs the risk of antagonizing these groups while 
striving to assert control over illegal border trade and 
embarrass Khin Nyunt.  End summary. 
 
Doing Without \"Withouts\" 
 
2. (SBU) Since the GOB stopped issuing import licenses for 
motor vehicles in 1996 (except to a select few individuals, 
including senior Buddhist monks, and organizations) it has 
been immensely expensive to import or purchase a car.  The 
resale price of one of the few import licenses granted is 
upwards of 50 million kyat (about $50,000 at market rates) 
and import tariffs for motor vehicles remain extremely high. 
Thus the market price is steep for cars imported legally, 
even for small or very used cars. 
 
3. (SBU) Those seeking a vehicle, but without the funds to 
buy a legally imported and licensed one, often looked to 
illegally imported and unlicensed (known as \"without\") 
vehicles.  Smugglers, in cahoots with Military Intelligence 
(MI) and its affiliated interagency border-control force 
NaSaKa, imported tens of thousands of cars, trucks, and 
motorbikes through porous borders and then used local 
cease-fire groups (CFGs), especially the GOB-allied 
Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) active across from Mae 
Sot, Thailand, to deliver the vehicles to purchasers 
throughout the border regions and as far inland as Mandalay 
and Rangoon.  Although smugglers had to pay significant 
bribes to MI and NaSaKa and $1,500 or more in \"handling 
charges\" to the CFG facilitators, these \"without\" cars 
retailed for a fraction of their legal counterparts. 
However, purchasers of these illegal cars remained forever in 
the pocket of MI, who could shake them down as necessary. 
 
4. (SBU) For several years another option for car smugglers 
was to bring in the \"without\" vehicle and take it to a chop 
shop inside Burma where it was converted into a \"domestically 
produced\" vehicle and licensed legally.  This ruse went on 
until early 2004, when the SPDC leadership instructed the 
Ministry of Industry (2) to crack down on cars \"manufactured\" 
in the country\'s industrial zones. 
 
5. (C) Since the ouster of former Prime Minister, and MI 
chief, Khin Nyunt in mid-October the regime has been actively 
targeting areas of MI economic control.  The trade in 
\"without\" vehicles is one of the most prominent.  Military 
and Customs officials at multiple checkpoints near the Thai 
and Chinese borders have been scrutinizing inbound vehicles 
to ensure they are legally licensed.  On November 9, the 
Director General of the national police told a large group of 
businesspeople that those surrendering their \"without\" 
vehicles would not be prosecuted -- though the cars would be 
impounded.  Since mid-October owners have been hiding their 
cars in hopes this campaign will blow over.  To cut off one 
refuge for scofflaws, on November 5 the Sangha Council (the 
top Buddhist religious body in Burma) instructed all 
monasteries to refuse donations or temporary storage of 
unlicensed cars. 
 
Targeting the Ethnics? 
 
6. (C) Because the \"without\" car business was such a money 
earner for the CFGs there is some concern that the crackdown 
on this trade, and illicit border trade in general, is as 
much an attack on MI-allied CFGs as it is on MI itself.  One 
Karen source in Rangoon told us the founder of the DKBA, a 
Buddhist abbott, traveled to Rangoon in early November to 
complain about the cut-off.  However, to date, according to 
an active Thai-border trader, the military and Customs 
officials remain vigilant.  One local newspaper reported that 
the police have seized several hundred \"without\" cars in 
Mandalay since Khin Nyunt fell. 
 
Comment: Pushing the Envelope 
 
7. (C) Despite the impact on the DKBA and other ethnic 
cease-fire groups (CFGs) previously benefiting from the 
illegal car trade, we believe the campaign is not 
specifically intended to punish those ethnics who allied with 
the former PM.  Instead we think the regime\'s motivations are 
twofold: (1) to identify areas of economic graft previously 
controlled by MI for takeover by the military; and, (2) to 
build up evidence of MI-controlled corruption to further 
discredit and/or prosecute Khin Nyunt and other former MI 
officials.  Most border traders still predict that all will 
be back to normal by year\'s end, with military and Customs 
officials firmly in charge of \"facilitation services.\" 
However, the SPDC takes the risk of antagonizing some CFGs in 
the meantime by taking away their economic bennies in order 
to punish MI.  Another immediate-term ramification of this 
campaign is surging retail car prices, a fact that some 
sources blame for an unprecedented wave of car thefts in 
Rangoon.  End comment.

1. (SBU) The GOB\'s announcement on November 18th that nearly 
4,000 prisoners -- mostly common criminals as it turns out -- 
would be released (ref A) is not symbolic of an improving 
attitude toward the democratic opposition.  There have been 
no releases since November 19th, and of those released (only 
1,000 thus far of the 4,000 promised) fewer than 30 were 
political prisoners.  In addition, NLD offices outside 
Rangoon remain shuttered and there has been no mention by 
authorities that they plan to release detained NLD leaders 
Aung San Suu Kyi and U Tin Oo nor one of the NLD\'s founders U 
Win Tin (who was rumored, incorrectly, to have been freed on 
the 19th). 
 
3. (SBU) Moving beyond maintaining the status quo for the 
NLD, however, the GOB continues to harass NLD members around 
the country arresting and prosecuting them on trumped up 
charges.  As mentioned in ref B, on November 5-6 police in 
Irrawaddy Division (south of Rangoon) arrested three local 
NLD members for violations of the Press and Publication Act, 
which prohibits publication and distribution of any material 
without prior approval by the GOB\'s censor board.  The NLD 
members, U Han Sein, U Than Htut, and U Win Maung, were 
traveling back to their hometowns carrying a regular shipment 
of NLD official proclamations for distribution among local 
party members.  The NLD\'s national and divisional leadership 
and lawyers have complained that the law allows distribution 
of official documentation from legal political parties.  Thus 
far this argument has carried no water, and on November 19th 
the Township court arbitrarily delayed a hearing for the 
three until the 29th stating that this case must be heard 
before the Divisional court.  According to NLD lawyers this 
is a very irregular decision. 
 
4. (C) Comment: There are rumors that the initial release of 
nearly 30 political prisoners is a precursor to a general 
amnesty, though we\'ve not seen any evidence that this is so. 
However, even as some number of political prisoners are 
released, the GOB continues its revolving door policy of 
matching publicly trumpeted releases with quiet new arrests. 
End comment.

1.  (S) SUMMARY:  NLD deputy chairman U Tin Oo, 77, remains 
under house arrest, although has been allowed to visit a 
private clinic for medical diagnosis.  He is undergoing 
medical treatment and may need surgery.  His wife, Dr. Tin 
Moe Wai, met with DCM November 26 to delivered a personal 
note from U Tin Oo thanking the Embassy for its ongoing 
support.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Conditions of Detention:  Former Burmese defense 
minister and NLD deputy chairman U Tin Oo, arrested in May 
2003 at the Depeyin attack, was imprisoned near the Indian 
border until his February 2004 transfer to house arrest in 
Rangoon.  He is confined to his home, may not have visitors, 
and his telephone line has been cut.  His wife, grandson, and 
daughter-in-law also live in the house, but may come and go 
as they please.  Security at the house has become less strict 
with the demise of Khin Nyunt\'s Military Intelligence (MI) 
apparatus; currently only four men (two police Special Branch 
and two regular police) guard the house.  Heretofore MI had 
checked all bags and packages, but now the security personnel 
only note the times Tin Oo\'s relatives come and go. 
 
3.  (S) A Message From U Tin Oo:  Emboffs have been smuggling 
National Geographic Magazines, messages, and some personal 
items to Tin Oo via relatives since his arrest in 2003.  DCM 
met November 26 with his wife, who delivered a handwritten 
note from U Tin Oo.  Excerpts follow: 
 
-- Thank you so much for your kind wishes and compliments. 
I\'m doing well now.  The only trouble is a very tiny 
gallstone, about the size of 8mm in diameter, which I could 
stay under the prescription of the specialist. 
 
-- Thanks again sending me some reading materials ... I had a 
good appetite, devouring all the National Geographic 
Magazines given ...  It was great entertainment, great pleasure 
and gaining many knowledge, as if I was visiting all parts of 
the world, especially U.S.A. 
 
-- I\'m looking forward seeing you all in very near future. 
 
4.  (S) Life Under House Arrest:  Dr. Tin Moe Wai (aka Aunty 
Shwe) said her husband has suffered from colitis and other 
abdominal pains and will likely need surgery for his 
gallstones.  He was taken for diagnosis at a private clinic 
last month and is currently on medication.  Aunty Shwe 
described his daily routine as encompassing morning prayers 
and meditation, a light lunch, afternoons spent writing his 
autobiography, early evening exercise in the garden, supper, 
and then TV news.  She said she did not think he was in any 
unusual danger from the regime at this time, but he 
acknowledged he was completely at their mercy. 
 
5.  (S) Request for Assistance:  When DCM asked if there was 
anything we could do for her husband, Dr. Tin Moe Wai 
mentioned two things.  She said U Tin Oo\'s greatest wish was 
to have their 18-year old grandson attend a university 
abroad. (His father, Tin Oo\'s only child, is a political 
asylee in Japan.) Unfortunately, the regime will not issue 
the young man a passport, Aunty Shwe lamented.  Second, she 
admitted they were nearly broke and needed money for food and 
utilities.  She explained that her husband did not receive 
his military pension and their sole source of income was rent 
from a house they owned.  The house was previously rented to 
Russian diplomats and then Western NGO workers, but the 
regime last year cut off the house\'s phone line, making it 
unrentable to normal tenants.  Dr. Tin Moe Wai asked if the 
embassy could rent the house, \"for only $300 per month, or 
$250 if that is too much.\" 
 
6.  (S) COMMENT:  U Tin Oo\'s note and his wife\'s attitude 
were chipper in tone.  Both expressed gratitude at not being 
forgotten by the American Embassy.  Dr. Tin Moe Wai was 
unwilling to venture political insights on her husband\'s 
behalf, commenting only \"time will tell,\" to several queries 
raised.  Indeed, time will tell, and it will also take its 
toll on the geriatric senior leadership of the NLD, whose 
median age is now 80, (a figure that includes the relatively 
sprightly Aung San Suu Kyi, 59).  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: The purge of those close to ex-PM Khin Nyunt 
is spreading to economic cronies -- no matter their \"worth\" 
to the economy.  This purge, combined with the ongoing 
crackdown on smuggling, will certainly cause some economic 
disruption.  How much, and for exactly how long, remain 
unclear.  However, by early 2005 all should be \"back to 
normal\" -- Burma style.  End summary. 
 
Internal Economic Destructionists Feel the Squeeze 
 
2. (C) According to reliable sources, top business cronies 
close to ousted Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt are 
starting to pay for having backed the wrong horse.  Initial 
indications were that the regime would allow some top 
business cronies to survive intact if they were providing key 
economic services to the state.  However, this may no longer 
be the case.  Though the sources said that none of Khin 
Nyunt\'s closest non-family business associates has yet been 
arrested, the GOB has apparently seized some of the assets of 
at least two of the most prominent.  These assets had been 
used as collateral for private bank loans that went unpaid 
after the private banking system collapsed in February 2003 
(ref C).  Despite defaults on the loans, these cronies had 
used their ties to Khin Nyunt to save their properties. 
 
3. (C) Meanwhile, the picture is growing clearer as to the 
fate of Khin Nyunt\'s eldest son, and prominent businessman, 
Dr. Ye Naing Win.  According to business and ASEAN diplomatic 
sources, the son, until mid-October the managing director of 
Burma\'s major private IT firm Bagan Cybertech (ref B), is now 
incarcerated at an unknown location.  Likewise, according to 
the new Singaporean ambassador, Dr. Ye Naing Win\'s wife, a 
Singaporean national, is in detention at her home and 
Singaporean diplomats have not been granted consular access. 
As reported previously (ref A), Bagan Cybertech was taken 
over by the Army\'s signal corps almost immediately after Khin 
Nyunt\'s downfall on October 19. 
 
Comment: A Cleansing of Undesirables 
 
4. (C) The regime\'s desire to root out Khin Nyunt\'s broad and 
deep influence is spreading from the political-military 
(where dozens of top Military Intelligence officers have 
already been purged) to the economic sphere.  Our sources 
speculated that the SPDC would financially ruin Khin Nyunt\'s 
top economic allies, and some lower-level ones as well. 
However, they did not see the campaign spreading to the 
economic arms of the ethnic cease-fire groups allied 
previously with Khin Nyunt -- though attacks on cronies are 
already collaterally damaging some of these groups\' business 
interests, which could cause unexpected political 
consequences.  This economic purge, along with the tougher 
line on illicit border trade (ref A), will cause some degree 
of chaos and economic slowdown for the immediate future (as 
during the months following implementation of new U.S. 
economic sanctions in July 2003).  However, we still believe 
business will be \"back to normal,\" though with new 
taskmasters, by early 2005.  End comment.

SUBJECT: EMBASSY RANGOON CONDUCTS HIV/AIDS TRAINING FOR ALL 
MISSION PERSONNEL 
 
REF: 03 BANGKOK 4203 
 
1.  Summary.  Embassy Rangoon has completed HIV/AIDS 
awareness training for all current mission staff in 
accordance with the Department of State\'s HIV/AIDS workplace 
policy and a Plan of Action established at the July 2003 
HIV/AIDS Chiefs of Mission Conference in Bangkok, at which 
COMs committed to \"conducting HIV/AIDS awareness training for 
every person under our authority.\" (reftel)  Training 
seminars ran throughout 2004, with the entire staff 
(including all agencies, direct- and local-hire personnel, 
and FSNs) attending mandatory sessions that covered topics 
such as HIV/AIDS transmission, prevention, treatment, 
societal impact, and overcoming negative perceptions and 
stigma associated with this disease.  The training was an 
overall success and also significantly contributed to the 
knowledge of Embassy personnel in combating HIV/AIDS in 
Burma, where an estimated 1.9 % of the population is infected 
with the HIV virus.  End Summary. 
 
2.  Embassy Rangoon, in conjunction with a local NGO, held 
eighteen classes of 20 employees each between April 30 and 
September 20, providing HIV/AIDS training for all Embassy 
workgroups and sections.  The three-hour, interactive 
seminars (at a reasonable cost to the mission of roughly 
$9.00 per person) were given in both English and Burmese, 
with 278 Locally Employed Staff (LES) and approximately 47 
American personnel attending the training sessions in mixed 
groups.  The courses taught participants about transmission, 
prevention, and treatment through multimedia presentations, 
games, open question-and-answer sessions, and activities that 
tested knowledge of HIV/AIDS issues. 
 
The Myanmar Business Coalition on AIDS 
 
3.  The Myanmar Business Coalition on AIDS (MBCA), a local 
NGO that specializes in providing workplace HIV/AIDS training 
to businesses and large organizations, conducted the classes 
for the U.S. mission.  Founded in 2000, MBCA has been funded 
by AusAID, the Fund for HIV/AIDS in Myanmar (FHAM), and many 
local businesses.  The organization\'s stated mission is to 
bring corporate resources to assist in HIV/AIDS prevention 
and to promote nondiscrimination policies and education 
programs in the workplace.  MBCA staff is comprised of local 
doctors and health educators that make \"house calls,\" 
bringing their demonstrations and classes into the workplace. 
 
Feedback from Staff 
 
4.  The feedback from our local staff was overwhelmingly 
positive.  One key impact of the training was a broadly 
expressed intent of employees to share the information 
learned with family and friends.  Several LES employees also 
commented on the lack of sex education in the Burmese school 
system, compounded by parental reluctance to discuss sexual 
issues with children.  For some employees, the Embassy 
HIV/AIDS training was the only sex education they had ever 
received.  Several LES asked about holding follow-up classes 
and discussion groups.  One staff member commented that 
although Burmese media had changed considerably in the past 
decade, presenting a more western approach to sex and 
male-female relations, there was no practical information on 
sexual health readily available to the general population. 
 
5.  The post health unit staff also attended a session to 
observe the training techniques of MBCA, and our post 
physician opined that from a medical standpoint the sessions 
were well conducted, significantly raising HIV/AIDS awareness 
in our embassy community.  American staff members also 
expressed a positive view of the training and, even though 
many felt they were already knowledgeable on HIV/AIDS issues, 
concluded that the sessions served as a good refresher. 
 
6.  Comment: As follow-up steps, Embassy Rangoon is 
considering holding advanced training sessions and running 
future classes on a regular basis in order to provide 
training for new embassy staff and for eligible family 
members and household employees.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: At the behest of the GOB, several 
Burmese-language newspapers have published articles detailing 
encounters between members of the diplomatic community, 
including U.S. Embassy personnel, and democracy activists, in 
the process reiterating that Big Brother\'s still on the job 
despite the recent evisceration of military intelligence.  We 
see this new GOB campaign as one of harassment, intending to 
intimidate and warn off those who seek to support the 
opposition.  End Summary. 
 
Making a List, Checking it Twice 
 
2. (SBU) Starting this week, the GOB has required several 
quasi-independent Rangoon weekly newspapers to publish 
articles detailing contacts between the diplomatic community 
and members of the democratic opposition.  According to 
Embassy sources, the GOB\'s Press Scrutiny Board (housed at 
the Ministry of Home Affairs) recently issued a directive to 
local newspapers requiring publication of what appear to be 
GOB surveillance reports of encounters between diplomats and 
the NLD and other dissidents. 
 
3. (SBU) The December 3rd edition of the \"Flower News,\" a new 
weekly published by a well-known Burmese journalist, carried 
an article entitled pithily: \"Entry, Exit, and Movement of 
Vehicles of Foreign Diplomatic Missions to and from NLD 
Headquarters.\"  The article had no commentary or analysis, 
but rather was a police log-style column that simply listed 
the diplomatic plate numbers of vehicles visiting the NLD\'s 
Rangoon HQ on November 22nd, the times of these visits, and a 
description of the visitors.  Somewhat ominously, the article 
identified by name those Burmese nationals who visited in 
diplomatic vehicles -- including one of the U.S. Embassy\'s 
political and economic Foreign Service Nationals.  According 
to the article, on November 22 the Germans, the French, the 
British (three times), the Australians, the Japanese, the 
UNDP, and the Americans (twice) visited NLD headquarters. 
 
And What Was on the Menu? 
 
4. (SBU) In this week\'s \"Good News Journal,\" published by a 
known SPDC apologist, another article appeared describing at 
length a November 22 encounter between U.S. Embassy officials 
and recently released democracy activist U Min Ko Naing (ref 
A).  Though the article accurately described the fact that an 
Emboff met with Min Ko Naing, and again identified by name a 
different U.S. Embassy political and economic FSN, the 
article incorrectly claimed that the Chief of Mission had Min 
Ko Naing to lunch at her residence.  The December 2nd 
editions of two additional publications, the \"7 Days News 
Journal\" and \"Myanmar Nation,\" also carried the identical 
article. 
 
5. (C) The Min Ko Naing article took some liberties 
characterizing (incorrectly) the discussion at the meeting, 
emphasizing an alleged \"statement\" by the activist that he 
\"opts not to secure power or position and has no contact with 
any political parties or veteran student activists.\"  It is 
unclear whether GOB officials \"debriefed\" Min Ko Naing after 
the meeting.  It is also possible that the article was based 
in part on incomplete surveillance of the meeting and further 
extrapolated from statements he made to international media 
representatives following his release on November 16th. 
 
Comment: We Know Who\'s Naughty and Nice 
 
6. (C) GOB scrutiny of U.S. and other diplomats is standard 
fare for the regime and the official press has traditionally 
devoted considerable ink to attacks against the NLD 
leadership and their diplomatic supporters.  However, the 
publication of surveillance reports is a new twist, clearly 
intended to further harass the beleaguered democracy 
movement, intimidate those locals who assist \"foreign 
destructionists,\" and warn off any diplomats who might think 
they can surreptitiously deal with the opposition. 
 
7. (C) These articles are a good reminder that although the 
Office of the Chief of Military Intelligence (OCMI), formerly 
under the direction of the ousted Khin Nyunt, is in disarray, 
no activities here go unnoticed.  As reported in ref B, the 
regime recently abolished OCMI and replaced it with a new 
\"Chief of Military Affairs Security,\" yet another indication 
that the SPDC may change names and faces, but will continue 
to rely on a broad intelligence network to counter any 
perceived threats to the junta\'s staying power (ref C).  End 
Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The GOB has instructed its 37-odd foreign 
envoys to return to Burma in three separate batches for 
\"reorientation\" and \"familiarization\" with new members of the 
government and senior military officers.  One senior official 
insists that rumors all of the ambassadors will be ousted are 
not true, but admits that some of the Burmese diplomats are 
\"afraid\" to come home.  We suspect that those ambassadors 
with close ties to ousted PM Khin Nyunt are vulnerable, as in 
the case of the now former Burmese ambassador to Thailand 
(ref B), but the ongoing purge of the Khin Nyunt empire will 
have a more likely impact on military intelligence agents 
embedded in Burmese missions overseas.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Rumors have been circulating for several weeks that 
the SPDC, following the October 19 ouster of former Prime 
Minister Khin Nyunt (ref A), had initiated a world-wide 
recall of all Burmese ambassadors at approximately 37 
overseas missions.  As the rumors have it, the regime planned 
to retire all of the envoys and, in some cases, arrest those 
with close ties to Khin Nyunt. 
 
3. (C) The COM recently spoke with MOFA\'s Director General 
for Protocol, Thura U Aung Htet, and asked about reports of a 
full recall of envoys or a massive changeover in the Burmese 
foreign service.  Aung Htet said that, indeed, the GOB had 
instructed ambassadors to return to Rangoon, but emphasized 
that the consultations were for \"reorientation\" and 
\"familiarization\" with new members of the government and 
senior military.  Aung Htet stressed that there was no 
\"global recall,\" but rather visits to Burma by three separate 
batches of ambassadors.  The first batch (which, according to 
Embassy sources, is comprised of Burmese diplomats posted 
throughout the Southeast Asia region) arrived in Burma in 
mid-November.  The second batch will arrive in early December 
and the third, and final, batch will visit in January. 
 
4. (C) U Aung Htet, an experienced 69 year-old diplomat who 
earned his honorific \"Thura\" title fighting the Burmese 
Communist Party in the 1970s, said that the first group of 
ambassadors was already visiting upcountry border posts and 
regional military commanders and meeting with new GOB 
ministers.  He admitted that many of the ambassadors were 
\"afraid\" to come home as they thought they were being 
summoned for removal (or worse).  However, Aung Htet insisted 
that rumors of a global ouster were not true. 
 
5. (C) An additional, and related, rumor has surfaced on the 
Democratic Voice of Burma and other exile media outlets 
claiming that the Burmese ambassador in London, Kyaw Win, has 
sought political asylum from the U.K.  The British Embassy in 
Rangoon tells us that their Foreign Office has no information 
on an asylum application, but acknowledges that as a result 
of confidentiality requirements they might not be privy to 
such a development.  Local contacts opine that it would be 
highly unlikely for Kyaw Win, a regime insider with close 
ties to senior SPDC officials, to quit his job while overseas. 
 
6. (C) Comment: Many of Burma\'s foreign envoys had close ties 
to Khin Nyunt and, contrary to Aung Htet\'s explanation, it 
does appear that at least one such ambassador has been 
removed (ref B, the former Burmese Ambassador to Thailand). 
Others are vulnerable and may meet the same fate.  However, a 
more likely scenario would be a broader recall of military 
intelligence agents buried in most Burmese embassies.  MI\'s 
function in foreign capitals has been to keep close tabs on 
GOB diplomats and Burmese exile groups.  The SPDC will not 
seek to abolish this essential function, but the ongoing 
purge of Khin Nyunt and his MI faithful will quite possibly 
extend overseas.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: Though there has been no official GOB 
announcement, on December 1st the NLD issued a statement 
indicating the SPDC would continue to hold Aung San Suu Kyi 
(ASSK) under house arrest for another year.  We suspect ASSK 
has requested her subordinates issue this statement to 
publicize a GOB action that the regime would prefer to keep 
quiet.  In any event, current press guidance -- noting that 
the SPDC has never specified a date for ASSK\'s release and 
expressing deep disappointment that the SPDC has ignored 
international calls for her (and others) release -- is the 
appropriate posture given current information. End summary. 
 
2. (U) The National League for Democracy (NLD) Central 
Executive Committee (CEC) issued a statement late on December 
1 that announced, effective November 27, 2004, \"(SPDC) 
authorities will hold Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the NLD General 
Secretary, under house arrest for an additional year under 
 
SIPDIS 
Section 10(b) of the Law to Safeguard the State Against the 
Dangers of Subversive Elements.\" 
 
3. (C) We spoke on December 2 with NLD Secretary U Lwin who 
said, contrary to the public statement, the NLD CEC was being 
\"cautious\" about what the GOB may have recently communicated 
to ASSK regarding her house arrest status.  According to U 
Lwin, he received a verbal message delivered on Monday 
November 29 by a member of ASSK\'s personal bodyguard, whom 
authorities allowed to visit NLD headquarters and return to 
the University Avenue compound.  The messenger relayed that 
an unidentified police officer from the Ministry of Home 
Affairs had visited ASSK on November 27 and read her an 
official order, citing the above Section 10(b), that informed 
her about an additional year of detention.  U Lwin said the 
NLD has no idea which SPDC member or GOB official signed the 
order. 
 
4. (S) U Lwin noted that since prior to November 27 the CEC 
has received no written communication from ASSK, a departure 
from recent practice (ref A).  As a result, he re-emphasized, 
\"we are being very cautious about reports of what may be 
happening (at the compound).\"  He also confirmed a report 
that ASSK\'s personal physician was questioned and searched at 
the compound on November 28, by GOB security personnel, 
during a routine medical visit.  Authorities told the 
physician that he would henceforth be limited to thrice 
weekly, instead of daily, visits unless a medical emergency 
required an exception. 
 
5. (C) U Lwin said he believed that the SPDC had extended 
ASSK\'s house arrest for two reasons.  First, the regime will 
reconvene the National Convention in February 2005 and is 
afraid ASSK would \"disrupt that process if freed\"  Second, 
the SPDC places a high priority on \"unfinished business\" with 
Burma\'s cease-fire insurgent groups and does not want to be 
further distracted by the democratic opposition.  He noted 
that he had heard from separate sources that \"Auntie (ASSK) 
was furious\" when the police official (whom U Lwin described 
as \"inexperienced\" in dealing with the democracy leader) read 
her the order on November 27, adding that in the past she had 
also become very angry with SPDC envoys, demanding to know 
why, and under what provisions of the law, she was being 
detained. 
 
6. (C) Note: In June, ASSK told UN Envoy Razali that she 
believed she was being held under Section 10(a) of the \"Law 
to Safeguard\" (ref C), which allows authorities to detain 
individuals for up to five years without trial.  Section 
10(b) allows for detention up to one year, but the period can 
be extended up to an additional year by the Minister of Home 
Affairs or up to five years by the Chairman of the SPDC. 
However, the GOB has consistently denied that ASSK is under 
house arrest (generally describing her situation as \"in 
protective custody for her own well-being\").  Contrary to 
international reports and speculation (ref B), the SPDC has 
not made a public announcement or otherwise addressed the 
alleged extension on November 27 of her house arrest.  End 
Note. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  On the issue of ASSK\'s house arrest status, 
the SPDC has said nothing, while the NLD has issued a 
statement \"announcing\" the regime\'s action.  We suspect that 
ASSK may have requested that the NLD CEC draw attention to 
the apparent extension, however uncertain that request may 
have been communicated.  However, the NLD, cognizant of 
consistent, and recent, statements from the United States 
calling for the release of ASSK, U Tin Oo, and other 
political detainees, is not asking that we specifically 
address the Section 10(b) extension.  November 29 EAP press 
guidance -- noting that the SPDC has never specified a date 
for ASSK\'s release and expressing deep disappointment that 
the SPDC has ignored international calls for her (and others) 
release -- is the appropriate posture given current 
information.  End Comment.

Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On December 6, the \"Group of Veteran Politicians and 
Colleagues\" - a political association of retired government 
officials, military officers, party leaders, and Burmese 
independence fighters - gathered in Rangoon to celebrate 
Burma\'s 84th anniversary of \"Glorious National Day.\"  The 
anniversary, recognized by the GOB as an official holiday but 
not widely observed, commemorates a 1920 student strike that 
sparked the struggle for Burmese independence from the 
British.  Several hundred supporters attended the Veterans\' 
event, as did members of the NLD Central Executive Committee 
and leaders of the pro-democracy ethnic political parties. 
Emboff was the only diplomat in attendance.  Also on the 
scene was a phalanx of military intelligence agents who 
photographed participants and filmed the entire proceedings. 
 
3. (C) Thakhin Thein Pe, the 89 year-old leader of the 
Veteran Politicians, read a chairman\'s statement that praised 
recently released political prisoners \"for their selfless 
sacrifices and beliefs\" and urged attendees to pray for the 
early release of NLD leaders Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) and U 
Tin Oo and other political prisoners.  At the event, Emboff 
spoke with NLD MP-elect U Ohn Maung, released from Insein 
Prison on November 19 after six years of detention (ref A), 
who said, \"As long as the MI thugs harass these peaceful 
events, I will be here to meet them.\" 
 
4. (U) In a group statement, the Veterans criticized the 
Burmese military regime for \"dishonorably\" ignoring the 
results of its own 1990 legislative elections.  The Veterans 
also chastised the SPDC for using notorious provisions of the 
1975 \"Law to Safeguard the State Against the Dangers of 
Subversive Elements,\" enacted by former dictator Ne Win, to 
target political party members.  The Veterans observed that 
the recent extension of ASSK\'s house arrest (ref B) was 
\"inappropriate\" and harmful to national reconciliation, 
noting that ASSK has frequently acknowledged her willingness 
to work with the military on the future of the country. 
 
5. (C) Comment: Individual members of the Veteran Politicians 
have for years suffered arbitrary arrest, long prison terms, 
and other human rights abuses under the Burmese regime 
(authorities, for example, detained Chairman Thein Pe in 2003 
for holding a National Day event without official 
permission).  However, collectively they have enjoyed a 
certain degree of immunity.  The SPDC, begrudgingly, feels 
compelled to respect their historical service to the country, 
but also views the group as politically benign (most of the 
members are in their 80s and 90s).  However, the Veterans\' 
feisty criticism of the regime and overt support of the 
pro-democracy movement is a breath of fresh air in an 
environment otherwise polluted by a climate of fear.  End

1. (C) Summary:  The Australian co-owner and editor of 
Burma\'s only non-GOB English-language newspaper, under 
serious pressure from the regime, has appealed to 
Rangoon-based ambassadors for statements of support should 
his publication \"be closed down for any reason.\"  Like many 
others who enjoyed the protection of the Khin Nyunt empire, 
his company is paying the price for having relied exclusively 
on connections to the ousted Prime Minister.  We would not 
view any U.S. interests at stake should The Myanmar Times and 
its editor, a regular apologist for the SPDC, go down in 
flames.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On December 3, Ross Dunkley, the Australian CEO and 
Editor-in-Chief of Myanmar Consolidated Media, circulated an 
open letter \"for the information of all ambassadors in 
Yangon.\"  Dunkley, who oversees several local publications 
and allegedly owns 49 percent of an English-language weekly, 
The Myanmar Times, appealed for foreign governments to issue 
statements of support in the event that his newspaper \"were 
to be closed down for any reason.\" 
 
3. (SBU) On November 29 authorities arrested U Myat Swe (aka 
\"Sonny Swe\"), Dunkley\'s business partner, and detained him 
under section 5(j) of the Emergency Provisions Act.  Sonny 
Swe is the son of Brigadier General Thein Swe, formerly a 
senior military intelligence (MI) official under ousted Prime 
Minister Khin Nyunt.  BG Thein Swe himself was a victim of 
the post-Khin Nyunt purge of MI and is reportedly detained at 
Insein Prison. 
 
4. (SBU) In his December 3 letter to Rangoon ambassadors, 
Dunkley claims that Sonny Swe is accused of \"using his 
father\'s influence to bypass the censorship process\" by 
seeking GOB approval for each edition of The Myanmar Times 
through MI, rather than through \"normal channels\" at the 
Ministry of Home Affairs and its Press Scrutiny Board. 
Dunkley also claimed that the GOB has in recent days 
requested that he turn over detailed documents on the 
company\'s financial and legal affairs. 
 
5. (SBU) Dunkley has claimed at various international venues, 
most notably in Bangkok and Washington, that his newspaper is 
fully independent and that he uses the publication to \"push 
the envelope\" and press for free speech and other political 
changes in Burma.  The Myanmar Times does, on rare occasion, 
publish limited news about events generally considered off 
limits by state media (e.g. natural disasters inside Burma, 
international meetings that discuss Burma developments, 
etc.).  However, as Dunkley freely admits, his publications 
are subject to government censorship and \"sensitive\" articles 
routinely hit the cutting floor.  The Myanmar Times never 
criticizes the military regime and each week prints a robust 
assortment of articles that praise GOB officials and the 
achievements of the SPDC. 
 
6. (SBU)  In the December 3 and 6 editions of the Burmese and 
English language editions, respectively, The Myanmar Times 
published an article detailing encounters between diplomatic 
missions, including the U.S. Embassy, and members of the NLD, 
a legal political party.  The article also gave an account, 
with many factual errors, of an encounter between Emboffs and 
a recently released political prisoner.  The article, which 
accused diplomats participating in these meetings of 
\"interfering in the internal affairs of Myanmar,\" is 
identical to a string of recent articles which publishers 
claim they were forced by the GOB to print (ref A).  An 
expatriate reporter for The Myanmar Times approached the COM 
on December 2 and told her that the article was being 
published at the direction of the Press Scrutiny Board. 
 
7. (SBU) In his appeal for support, Dunkley states that The 
Myanmar Times has \"never once in five years embarrassed the 
government or Myanmar.\"  He continues, \"In line with the 
policies of the government we have always wholly encouraged 
the development of the road map\" and \"we are...a very visible 
example of a successful Myanmar-Foreign cooperation.\" 
Dunkley concludes that \"I hope your government would defend 
The Myanmar Times..and see it as an integral part of the 
progression of the SPDC on its road map and transition to 
democracy.\" 
 
8. (C) Comment: Dunkley enjoyed a cozy relationship with MI 
which allowed him to publish the only English-language 
newspaper in Burma outside of official media.  Like many 
others who once enjoyed the protection of the Khin Nyunt 
empire, his company is paying the price for having relied 
exclusively on connections to the ousted Prime Minister (ref 
B) and he feels particularly vulnerable now that his once 
well-connected Burmese business partner, and the partner\'s MI 
father, are behind bars.  We would not view any U.S. 
interests at stake should The Myanmar Times go down in flames 
and/or Dunkley meet the fate of his business cohorts.  The 
expatriate community might lament the loss of a rare source 
of English-language local entertainment and social news and 
the Australian Embassy may have a sticky citizen case on its 
hands.  However, the political impact would be close to nil, 
other than giving pause to foreigners engaged in or 
contemplating joint ventures with the Burmese regime.  End

1. (C) Summary:  U Kyaw Hsan, a 72 year-old NLD MP-elect 
released on November 19 after spending nine of the previous 
twelve years at Insein Prison, is already back on the job. 
Our recent encounter with this elderly but energetic activist 
revealed additional evidence that the regime\'s primary tool 
against political detainees is not necessarily physical 
torture, but taxing solitary confinement.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) U Kyaw Hsan, an NLD MP-elect from Sagaing Division who 
emerged from Insein Prison on November 19 (ref B), recently 
approached us while we were meeting with NLD leaders (ref C). 
 The 72 year-old party leader (aka Kyaw Sann), who retired in 
1986 as a Lt Colonel in the Burmese Army, had spent nine of 
the previous twelve years as a political prisoner. 
 
3. (SBU) Like some other recently released political 
prisoners (ref A), Kyaw Hsan was freed without conditions. 
Prison officials simply notified him of the SPDC\'s November 
18 order regarding \"irregularities\" of the disbanded National 
Intelligence Bureau and drove him home in a prison sedan.  He 
noted that authorities had actually issued him release papers 
in March 2002, but refused to set him free, cruelly 
prolonging his detention indefinitely under Section 10(a) of 
the 1975 \"Law to Safeguard the State Against the Dangers of 
Subversive Elements.\" 
 
4. (SBU) Kyaw Hsan recounted that in January 1992 the 
then-SLORC regime ordered his arrest under Section 5(j) of 
the Emergency Provisional Act for having supported the Nobel 
Peace Prize to Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) and for protesting 
ASSK\'s forced removal from the NLD\'s Central Executive 
Committee.  The regime released Kyaw Hsan in February 1995 
after three years at Insein Prison, but rearrested him in 
September 1998 to serve the remainder of a ten-year term, 
alleging that he had renewed his \"illegal\" political 
activities. 
 
5. (SBU) Kyaw Hsan recounted how he had spent six lonely and 
difficult years in solitary confinement.  He said that he was 
not physically tortured while at Insein Prison, but noted 
that the isolation was brutal.  During his solitary 
confinement, his only contact with other human beings was 
twice monthly family visits; however, he was separated from 
family members by thick glass and ten-feet of space and their 
conversations were recorded by prison officials. 
 
6. (SBU) During his first stint at Insein Prison, Kyaw Hsan 
was housed in an annex for political prisoners and other 
\"special\" detainees.  However, his second and longer prison 
stay was spent in a special ward for political detainees 
where he, and other prisoners, were confined inside isolated 
cells.  He said that authorities never allowed the political 
prisoners to talk with, or to see, each other.  The political 
prisoners only knew that they were not alone at Insein when 
they were grouped together once every six months for visits 
from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  In 
addition, Kyaw Hsan also had visits from UN human rights 
envoy Pinheiro (twice) and representatives from Amnesty 
International (once) during his 1998-2004 incarceration. 
 
7. (C) Kyaw Hsan appeared to us to be in excellent physical 
health and in high good spirits, joking that, with little to 
do in prison but read religious materials, he had counted his 
detention one minute at a time, \"for nine years, two months, 
28 days, and several hours.\"  He said he had survived his 
\"experience in Hell\" through meditation and by virtue of 
receiving regular food deliveries from family members.  He 
also expressed gratitude for support from the international 
community, \"especially the United States,\" observing that 
pressure and sanctions had also helped in keeping him alive. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  Our encounter with U Kyaw Hsan took place, 
surprisingly, at NLD headquarters in Rangoon.  Barely days 
out of his lengthy and difficult prison stint, the elderly 
but energetic party leader was back on the job, decked out in 
full NLD regalia.  \"The last I knew,\" he declared, \"I was 
still the NLD division leader for Sagaing and I\'ve got work 
to do.\"  Proving his point, he added in his official capacity 
that the party continued to encourage the United States and 
others to bring the Burma question before the UN Security 
Council.  \"I know that the NLD must labor inside the country 
if democracy is going to flourish in Burma\", he said, \"but we 
also need international support.\"  End Comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA: THE EYES HAVE IT 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: A favorite of ASSK\'s, U.S.-based NGO ORBIS, 
arrived in Mandalay on December 5th.  The flying eye hospital 
and 11 foreign doctors will spend two weeks providing free 
operations for patients and education and hands-on training 
for nearly 100 Burmese medical staff.  Despite clear benefits 
to the local community from the NGO\'s humanitarian mission, 
sustainable progress remains difficult while the GOB refuses 
to adequately support healthcare.  End summary. 
 
Mandalay Welcomes Flying Eye Hospital 
 
2. (SBU) On December 5th, the U.S.-based NGO ORBIS flew its 
eye hospital into Mandalay aboard a DC-10.  This flying 
hospital has come to Burma once before, in 2000, and ORBIS 
conducted six other hospital-based ophthalmologic programs in 
Rangoon hospitals prior to that.  The objectives of this 
latest two-week program are to conduct free eye surgeries for 
dozens of patients as well as to provide education and 
hands-on training to Burmese ophthalmologists and surgical 
nurses as well as equipment and training for medical 
technicians at the Mandalay Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat 
Hospital.  Over the two weeks, 11 physicians and nurses from 
the United States, Europe, and Taiwan will participate in the 
program -- sponsored by the Taiwanese national aid agency, 
the International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF). 
According to an official from ICDF, this program is a trial 
balloon to assess if further humanitarian aid from Taiwan is 
feasible. 
 
3. (U) We visited ORBIS\' operation in Mandalay during its 
weekly screening day as well as one day of onboard surgery. 
During the screening day, about 100 patients, referred as 
untreatable by local eye doctors come to meet the ORBIS 
consultants.  The consultants see all of the patients, confer 
with local physicians, and refer a small percentage for 
surgery.  According to ORBIS, the majority of patients suffer 
from vision loss due to cataracts with a smaller number due 
to glaucoma and posterior segment diseases. 
 
Capacity, Resources a Problem 
 
4. (SBU) ORBIS staff noted that a lack of modern medical 
education, an oppressive hierarchical system in the medical 
profession (wherein only the senior staff get advanced 
training and time on hi-tech equipment), and poor supply and 
maintenance of equipment were the main barriers to adequate 
care in Burma\'s eye hospitals.  In addition irregular 
electricity make it difficult to operate and maintain 
sophisticated equipment that has become the norm in developed 
country eye clinics. 
 
5. (SBU) Though ORBIS doctors did not make this point, it\'s 
clear most of these problems boil down to resources.  The GOB 
continues to deny the Ministry of Health (which operates 
public hospitals) an adequate budget.  In the latest budget 
figures, the GOB is allocating only about 0.50 cents per 
capita for healthcare. 
 
Comment: ASSK is an ORBIS Fan 
 
6. (SBU) The ORBIS visit has been a priority for more than 
two years, when NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) asked for 
USG assistance encouraging ORBIS to come back to Burma. 
Though the Ministry of Health never opposed the idea, the 
wheels of bureaucracy turned incredibly slowly in this case. 
ASSK had also asked for our help in contacting Operation 
Smile (which does free palate surgeries) and urging that NGO 
to come to Burma.  While there are short-term benefits to the 
local community from the ORBIS missions, sustainable progress 
remains unlikely so long as there is poor budgetary and 
political support for healthcare.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary: Excerpts from a December 2nd letter from the 
NLD to Senior General Than Shwe indicate a new effort to 
engage the SPDC and prompt a bilateral dialogue.  The letter 
is purportedly the \"soft\" approach, which, if ignored, will 
be followed up by more \"confrontational methods.\"  Though the 
Committee to Represent the People\'s Parliament (controlled by 
the NLD but also representing ethnic political parties) has 
endorsed this approach, we have our doubts that if push comes 
to shove the Committee\'s minority group of non-NLD ethnic 
members will take personal risks without some promise of a 
seat at the negotiating table should the regime agree to 
talk. End summary. 
 
NLD Issues Ultimatum 
 
2. (SBU) On December 9th, the NLD released a statement 
including a portion of a letter dated December 2nd from the 
NLD Central Executive Committee (CEC) to SPDC Chairman Senior 
General Than Shwe.  The NLD has not made available the rest 
of the clearly lengthy correspondence.  The portion released 
calls for a genuine and open dialogue \"clear of grudges\" and 
based on \"mutual respect,\" \"understanding,\" and \"cooperation\" 
to commence between the SPDC and the NLD.  It does not call 
for tripartite discussions, but notes that unity of all 
ethnic parties and groups is essential for \"a strong and 
everlasting nation.\"  Dialogue, the letter states, is the 
only way to ensure a \"strong and stable Union\" into the 
future.  It reiterates the importance the NLD places on 
national reconciliation and national unity and seeks common 
ground with Than Shwe by quoting statements he made in a 
mid-November speech that stress the importance of \"national 
unity\" as the foundation of democracy. 
 
3. (SBU) The statement notes that the Committee to Represent 
the People\'s Parliament (CRPP, formed by the NLD in 1998 to 
represent 14 ethnic and non-ethnic political parties), 
endorses the contents of the letter and calls for a dialogue 
to commence before the Burmese Independence Day holiday on 
January 4th.  There are no consequences spelled out if this 
deadline is ignored or missed. 
 
CRPP\'s Warning Shot? 
 
4. (C) According to a reliable CRPP source, the letter to 
Than Shwe is the brainchild of the NLD-dominated CRPP, which 
met on November 18th and again on the 29th to work on the 
draft.  According to the source, the CRPP decided to try 
first offering an olive branch to Than Shwe, convincing him 
that the two sides were after the same objective and thus 
good-faith negotiations should occur.  The source told us 
that the CRPP agreed that if this soft approach fails \"more 
confrontational\" methods would be used to break the political 
deadlock.  The source refused to hint at what these methods 
might be.  One proposal suggested in late August by some of 
the more impatient NLD regional leaders was to convene a 
shadow \"People\'s Parliament\" (ref B).  However, this 
provocative act still seems an unlikely move with NLD leaders 
Aung San Suu Kyi and U Tin Oo under house arrest. 
 
Comment: A Risky Strategy 
 
5. (C) The CRPP runs some risks by issuing an ultimatum 
promising a \"confrontational approach\" should it be ignored. 
Internal CRPP politics and discussions are not clear, but we 
have doubts that the Committee\'s minority group of non-NLD 
ethnic members would agree wholeheartedly to take personal 
risks by actively confronting the SPDC without some guarantee 
of a seat at the negotiating table should the regime agree to 
talk.  We would be surprised if the SPDC responds favorably 
to this initial soft-line.  If the deadline passes, and the 
NLD CEC decides to push for implementation of more aggressive 
measures, unity of the CRPP could come under strain.  End 
comment.

1.  (C) Summary:  On December 9, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin 
Shinawatra visited Rangoon and met with State Peace and 
Development Council (SPDC) Chairman Senior General Than Shwe. 
Thaskin reportedly assured Than Shwe that Thailand would 
continue a policy of non-interference in Burma\'s internal 
affairs on such matters as prisoner releases, but Aung San 
Suu Kyi\'s continued house arrest was an international matter 
and needed to be resolved. The  RTG had been trying to 
arrange a Thaskin/Than Shwe meeting in Rangoon since the 
\"Bangkok Process\" fell apart in April and probably wanted to 
come away from the meeting with the feeling that some sort of 
useful dialog had been established.  According to the Thai 
Ambassador, Thaksin came to the conclusion that Than Shwe and 
his military regime \"only manage the country, they do not 
make any policy\" which Dhirakaosal elaborated as meaning that 
Than Shwe and the rest of the generals just focused on 
maintaining power with no vision for the future.    End 
summary. 
 
2. (C)   On the excuse of attending the \"World Buddhist 
Summit\" Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, visited 
Rangoon for four hours on December 9 at the invitation of 
Burmese Prime Minister Lt. General Soe Win and met with State 
Peace and Development Council (SPDC) Chairman Senior General 
Than Shwe.  According to Thailand\'s ambassador in Rangoon, 
Suphot Dhirakaosal, after a ceremonial appearance and speech 
at the opening ceremonies of the Summit, Thaksin was asked to 
cool his heels (steaming all the while, we are told) and wait 
for Than Shwe to greet the Laotian Prime Minister and 
Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister.  According to Dhirakaosal, 
the word from the Burmese was that, if Thaksin could not 
wait, he could meet with SPDC Vice-Chairman Maung Aye instead. 
 
3. (C)  When Thaksin and Than Shwe finally came together, in 
the closed fifty minute meeting Thaksin was accompanied only 
by Thai Foreign Minister Surakiat Sathirathai and by Thai 
Foreign Ministry official Minister Counselor Damrong 
Kraikruan (the senior working-level officer responsible for 
Burma affairs) as notetaker (although newspaper photos prior 
to the meeting show a ten member Thai delegation flanked by 
eight senior Burmese officials). Than Shwe was accompanied by 
Vice Senior General Maung Aye, Prime Minister Lt. General Soe 
Win, Lt. General Thein Sein (SPDC Secretary 1), and General 
Thura Shwe Man (Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces). 
According to Dhirakaosal (who was excluded), Thaskin wanted a 
small meeting and also wanted to signal the importance of 
civilian authority over the military by asking the military 
members of the Thai delegation to be \"sent out.\"  Than Shwe 
also sent a message of how little importance the regime 
places on its Ministry of Foreign Affairs by dismissing the 
Burmese Foreign Minister from the meeting in which his Thai 
counterpart participated. 
 
4. (C)   According to Dhirakaosal, although Than Shwe seemed 
willing to engage in some discussion of the issues of 
democratization and economic reform,  Maung Aye took every 
opportunity to turn  any conversation to the need for 
internal stability and the danger posed by Aung San Suu Kyi 
(ASSK), the NLD, and other pro-democracy groups.  Dhirakaosal 
said that, according to Maung Aye, if ASSK were released the 
country could revert back to the days when the Burmese Army 
was fighting the Burmese Communist Party insurgency and \"the 
rivers were filled with blood.\"  Maung Aye asked numerous 
times, \"who will guarantee our internal stability?\" 
 
5. (C)  Dhirakaosal said Thaskin had assured Than Shwe that 
Thailand would continue a policy of non-interference in 
Burma\'s internal affairs on such matters as prisoner 
releases, but that the matter of ASSK\'s continued house 
arrest was an international matter and needed to be resolved. 
 According to Dhirakaosal, Thaskin told Than Shwe it is a 
\"matter of credibility.\"  Dhirakaosal added that he believed 
that PM Soe Win actually did not know that ASSK\'s house 
arrest had been extended when he was questioned about the 
matter at the ASEAN Summit in Vientiane and that the 
extension of ASSK\'s house arrest was an action of Maung Aye. 
Dhirakaosal also said that he was extremely skeptical that 
the number of released prisoners was anywhere near the 
regime\'s claim of over 9,000 (Note: the GOB now claims over 
14,000. End note.) and he felt it was unlikely the regime 
would provide any detailed information as to the names or 
whereabouts of the thousands allegedly freed. 
 
6. (C)  Dhirakaosal also said that Thaksin assured Than Shwe 
that Thailand would continue its policy of not harboring 
armed insurgents on its border with Burma.  According to 
Dhirakaosal, PM Thaksin did not raise matter of the 
negotiations between the regime and the Kachin National Union 
(KNU) because \"the KNU have nothing to negotiate ... they are 
gone.\" 
 
7. (C)  Ambassador Dhirakaosal expressed his disappointment 
at the lack of any real substance resulting from the visit 
and irritation with Maung Aye\'s constant harping on the need 
for internal stability as a reason for not releasing Aung San 
Suu Kyi. Dhirakaosal characterized Thaksin as coming to the 
conclusion that Than Shwe and his military regime \"only 
manage the country they do not make any policy\"  which 
Dhirakaosal elaborated as meaning that Than Shwe and the rest 
of the generals just focused on maintaining power with no 
vision for the future.  According to Dhirakaosal, the idea of 
a second meeting of the Bangkok Process was not being 
considered until the regime had something to offer that would 
establish international credibility vis-a-vis the release of 
political prisoners and progress towards democratization. 
 
8. (C)   Comment:  Dhirakaosal was particularly frustrated by 
Maung Aye\'s ability to divert discussion from democratization 
and economic issues.  He conveyed the impression that the 
discussion between Thaksin and Than Shwe might have been more 
substantive on these matters absent the intervention of Maung 
Aye.  However, that Than Shwe and Maung Aye were playing good 
cop/bad cop (bad cop/ worse cop?) is also a strong 
possibility - allowing Than Shwe to avoid making any promises 
or concessions.  The  RTG had been trying to arrange a 
Thaskin/Than Shwe meeting in Rangoon since the Bangkok 
Process fell apart in April and probably wanted to come away 
from the meeting with the feeling that some sort of useful 
dialog had been established. Judging from Dhirakaosal\'s 
comments, it seems Thaksin has been disappointed. End

1.  (SBU) Congress has appropriated and earmarked millions of 
dollars to support Burma\'s pro-democracy movement and those 
Burmese seeking refuge from the junta\'s tyranny.  While a 
portion of this funding appropriately supports thousands of 
Burmese who have fled their country, direct support for the 
pro-democracy movement inside Burma, despite the dire need, 
is much smaller in scale. 
 
2.  (S/NF) As detailed refs A and B, Embassy Rangoon has 
recently received two requests for USG financial assistance 
from pro-democracy leaders.  The first is from an association 
of ten pro-democracy political parties, the United 
Nationalities Alliance (UNA).  The UNA\'s member parties, most 
of whom have been de-registered by the regime, represent 
ethnic minority groups.  The parties are well aware that such 
assistance would not have the sanction of the SPDC.  The 
second request came indirectly from U Tin Oo, the Vice 
Chairman of the National League for Democracy who has been 
imprisoned or under house arrest since May 2003, via his 
wife.  The request is to rent a house for $300 per month, as 
the vacant rental property provides the only source of money 
for food and utilities for U Tin Oo and his family.  The NLD, 
as a party, has not requested direct USG financial assistance. 
 
 3.  (S/NF) Post seeks the views of the Department and others 
regarding the possibility of undertaking a small-scale, 
stealthy program of financial assistance directly to 
pro-democracy leaders inside Burma who have asked for our 
support.  Such assistance would best be aimed at helping 
sustain the parties\' organizational and leadership 
capabilities. 
 
4.  (S/NF) COMMENT:  $100,000 would be an adequate initial 
sum for the short- to mid-term sustenance of the 
pro-democracy leadership as per the two requests described 
reftels.  Post suggests that a tailor-made, Post-administered 
contract or purchase agreement would be the preferred 
delivery mechanism.  For example, the leadership of 
participating political parties could provide a nominal 
product, such as a written account of its experiences in the 
1990 election, in exchange for a relatively modest sum that 
could be used to help sustain the party.  Further, U Tin Oo\'s 
vacant rental property could be used, nominally, to store 
materials for our \"Global English\" Program.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary:  The UN\'s refugee agency has essentially 
exhausted its mandate to oversee repatriation operations 
along the Bangladesh border in northern Rakhine State and 
settled into an uneasy but crucial role providing a wide 
umbrella of protection, and coordinating basic relief 
services, for the region\'s 800,000 stateless and repressed 
Rohingya Muslims.  UNHCR, and several of its dozen 
implementing partners, conclude that the Burmese regime\'s 
repressive treatment of the Muslim population makes the 
region ripe for Islamic militancy.  It is clear that the 
presence of UNHCR and INGOs helps to limit the appeal of 
extremism and to protect the local population from even 
broader regime abuses.  However, any of the SPDC\'s harsh 
tools of repression that could fuel extremism are also the 
same means by which the regime will likely thwart such 
activity.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Our December 8-10 trip to northern Rakhine State 
(NRS), organized by UNHCR for over a dozen Rangoon and 
Bangkok diplomats, was our most recent opportunity to visit 
this politically sensitive and remote area.  The GOB 
prohibits tourists, foreign and domestic, from visiting the 
heavily military controlled region and reluctantly grants 
permission to diplomats traveling under the auspices of the 
UNHCR.  According to UNHCR resident representative Rajiv 
Kapur, recent political changes in Burma almost led to the 
cancellation of the December trip until SPDC Senior General 
Than Shwe personally issued a \"last-minute\" authorization. 
 
You Have the Right to....Just About Nothing 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) As during previous UNHCR trips (refs A and B), we 
witnessed first-hand a stunning and systematic array of 
regime tactics aimed at repressing Rakhine State\'s nearly 
800,000 Rohingya Muslims, one-third of whom are refugee 
returnees from Bangladesh.  Restrictions and abuses include, 
but are not limited to: denial of Burmese citizenship 
(despite birth in Burma or generations of residency); 
high-level permission required for marriage, movement between 
villages, and employment; widespread forced labor and 
compulsory contributions; a complete lack of due process; a 
prohibition on ownership of land and on state employment; 
limited access to post-secondary education; a moratorium on 
construction or refurbishing of mosques; restrictions on 
public celebrations of holidays; and a requirement that many 
consumables and services be purchased solely through 
state-designated agents. 
 
4. (SBU) An additional regime tactic has been the ongoing 
construction of \"model villages\" for ethnic Burmans 
(Buddhists) relocated from other parts of Burma in exchange 
for housing and arable land.  At least 22 model villages are 
in operation, built with local forced labor.  The 
self-contained enclaves, which include schools and health 
clinics and are strictly off-limits to Muslims, are 
reportedly a pet project of Than Shwe\'s and are designed to 
\"mitigate\" the three percent population growth among 
Rohingya.  The model villages, highly resented by locals, are 
a dismal failure as many of the urbanite Burman \"pioneers\" 
quickly abandon their isolated homesteads.  The GOB has 
countered this attrition by populating the latest model 
villages with ex-convicts and former insurgents, surrounding 
the compounds with barbed wire and armed guards. 
 
\"The UN High Commissioner for Refugees....and Human Rights\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5. (U) UNHCR\'s primary objectives in NRS are to facilitate 
the voluntary repatriation of remaining camp residents in 
Bangladesh (about 19,800 Rohingya, the majority of whom have 
indicated no desire to return to Burma) and to ensure the 
sustainable reintegration of vulnerable groups among those 
who have returned (a total of over 236,000 since 1992) and 
among those who did not flee during the 1991-92 exodus 
(roughly 550,000).  As it has for several years (ref A and 
B), the UNHCR supports or collaborates with twelve 
international NGOs and three GOB-affiliated entities in 
providing a wide range of successful reintegration activities 
including health care, community services, language training, 
income generation, agricultural support, and various feeding 
programs. 
 
6. (C) UNHCR\'s role in facilitating voluntary repatriation, 
however, has diminished significantly.  In 2004, less than 
200 refugees have repatriated through official channels, 
leaving UNHCR to focus almost exclusively on protection and 
reintegration issues.  Senior UNHCR staff admit that the 
organization has taken on what is largely a human rights 
function, protecting the repressed Muslim population as well 
as the international NGOs that operate in the region.  NGO 
officials and local community leaders alike expressed concern 
that should UNHCR terminate its presence in the region, no 
other entity could duplicate its protection and coordination 
role, leaving the Rohingya and the NGOs even more vulnerable 
to the excesses of the military regime. 
 
Adding Fuel to the Fire? 
------------------------ 
 
7. (C) UNHCR and NGO staff reported that prior to a 
Rangoon-directed purge of former Prime Minister Khin Nyunt\'s 
military intelligence apparatus (ref C), the MI component of 
the local Border Immigration Headquarters (known as \"NaSaKa\") 
played a leading role in the bullying and repression of the 
Rohingya population.  In the post-purge era, MI has all but 
\"disappeared.\"  However, initial breathing room appears to be 
short-lived, as regular Army units and Special Branch police 
have replaced MI with, according to UNHCR and NGOs, \"even 
more restrictive measures.\" 
 
8. (C) The combination of decades of centrally directed 
repression, a virtual Burmese military \"cordon\" that 
surrounds the northern Rakhine region, and a porous border 
with neighboring Bangladesh creates what UNHCR and several 
NGOs described as a situation \"ripe for Islamic militancy.\" 
One UNHCR senior official said, \"it is clear that a sea of 
idle, unemployed men--denied citizenship and the right to 
marriage, and living in close proximity to well-funded 
organizations in Bangladesh--have nowhere to vent their 
frustrations and are easy pickings for Muslim extremists 
hungry for safe-havens and new adherents.\" 
 
Comment: Ripe for Extremists But Rotten for Extremism 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
9. (C) Rohingya Muslims, among Burma\'s most repressed 
populations, face a hopeless and uncertain future and, with 
repatriation slowed to a mere trickle, UNHCR\'s original 
mandate has been largely fulfilled.  However, UNHCR continues 
to play a crucial protection role and has demonstrated a 
capability to take the regime to task over sensitive issues 
in this region (ref D).  Resident cards issued to all 
returnees, a reduction in forced labor incidents, and a 
softening of restrictions on INGOs are but a few of UNHCR\'s 
recent achievements.  We are hard-pressed to identify a 
successor organization if/when UNHCR departs.  The ICRC, for 
example, would be unable to provide protection for other 
INGOs; the UNDP would have no capacity to tangle with 
authorities over human rights abuses; and no organization 
would be as likely as UNHCR to provide the international 
community with regular assessments on regime abuses and 
growing discontent among the repressed Muslim population. 
 
10. (C) On the issue of extremism in northern Rakhine State, 
we agree with UNHCR that hopeless conditions make the region 
\"ripe for militancy\" and the presence of UNHCR and INGOs 
helps limit the appeal of extremism.  However, the SPDC\'s 
harsh tools of repression are the very means by which the 
regime thwarts either extremism or political opposition.  The 
Burmese Army has succeeded in rendering ineffective such 
insurgent movements as the Arakan Rohingya Islamic Front and 
the Rohingya Solidarity Organization, groups that are now 
dormant if not extinct.  The SPDC has also banned Muslim 
political parties, including the pro-democracy National 
Democratic Party for Human Rights and its four Rohingya 
elected to Parliament in 1990.  Furthermore, strict 
restrictions on movement and assembly; an imposing military 
presence; and prison terms for the most minor of infractions 
are imposing obstacles to any would-be extremists.  End

1. (SBU) Summary: The SPDC carried off its World Buddhist 
Summit despite the 11th hour loss of the primary sponsor and 
the 1,600 attendees it was planning to bring.  The regime 
saved face by launching a dual strategy of publicly 
belittling its departed Japanese co-sponsor while using 
influential Burmese Buddhists overseas to whip up support and 
attendees.  Though the Summit was not notable for its 
doctrinal initiatives, it met the regime\'s more important 
definition of success -- bolstering the SPDC\'s notions of its 
international credibility and role as defender of Theravada 
Buddhism.  End summary. 
 
GOB Pulls Off the Sponsorless Summit 
 
2. (U) Despite the October 30th decision by Japan\'s 
Nenbutsushu Buddhist sect to pull its sponsorship, the SPDC 
plowed ahead with its World Buddhist Summit from December 
9-11 (ref B).  The only concession made to the original 
sponsors, who bailed following the ouster of former Prime 
Minister, and Summit champion, General Khin Nyunt, was to 
drop \"The 4th\" from the name of the Summit.  The Nenbutsushu 
sect had sponsored three prior World Buddhist Summits in 
Japan, Thailand, and Cambodia and insisted Rangoon could not 
host the \"4th\" such World Summit without it. 
 
3. (SBU) According to Burmese state-run media, 1,652 monks 
from 36 countries attended the 3-day event, held in a 
man-made \"cave\" built in 1956 for the 6th Buddhist Synod. 
However, 1,200 of these monks were Burmese -- either from 
Burma or flown back from neighboring countries for the event. 
 Despite the negative publicity of Nenbutsushu\'s pull-out and 
global calls for boycott, the Thai and Laotian Prime 
Ministers, and the Cambodian Deputy PM, attended the opening 
ceremony (ref A).  Religious Affairs Ministry representatives 
or Rangoon-based ambassadors read congratulatory messages 
from the PMs of Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Nepal, and the 
Presidents of India and Sri Lanka.  (Note: the Sri Lankan PM 
showed up for an official visit to Burma, but arrived on the 
day the Summit closed and did not participate.  End note.) 
So-called \"arch-monks\" from 28 countries also attended the 
Summit. 
 
Nevermind the Mahayana Sects 
 
4. (SBU) Following Nenbutsushu\'s decision, the SPDC adopted a 
two-prong strategy in order to save face.  First, SPDC media 
mouthpieces and the Religious Affairs Ministry launched 
vicious attacks on Nenbutsushu and on Mahayana Buddhism in 
general (Burmese Buddhism is Theravada).  A December 4th 
article in \"The New Light of Myanmar,\" called the Nenbutsushu 
sect \"third-class\" and accused it of trying to establish its 
headquarters in Japan as \"the Vatican\" of Buddhism.  It 
downplayed the importance of the sect\'s financial 
contributions, claiming the group had committed to pay only 
10 percent of the overall expenses -- an unlikely assertion, 
as Nenbutsushu had planned to pay the airfare and lodging for 
more than a 1,600 attendees from Japan.  A December 11th 
\"editorial\" fumed that since, \"...hatching evil plots against 
others is against\" Buddhist teachings, Nenbutsushu\'s attempt 
to \"plot to stop Myanmar from holding the Summit...is a sin.\" 
 
5. (SBU) The Religious Affairs Ministry took the mudslinging 
a step further, claiming the Mahayana Buddhism practiced by 
the Nenbutsushu sect is incompatible with the practices of 
Theravada Buddhism.  The Ministry further asserted that 
Nenbutsushu\'s decision was for the best, as it was not really 
appropriate for such a low-ranking Mahayana sect to sponsor a 
Buddhist Summit inside Burma, the \"champion\" of Theravada 
Buddhism. 
 
Round \'Em Up 
 
6. (C) Aside from trashing the Summit\'s erstwhile co-sponsor, 
the other component of the SPDC strategy involved drafting 
into service Burmese religious figures of international 
standing to whip up attendees.  According to a GOB source, 
since early November the Ministry of Religious Affairs along 
with a pro-SPDC, fundamentalist Theravada monk and teacher -- 
known as Saya Thigadu -- have been working with overseas 
Burmese-born monks and teachers.  One in particular, an 
ethnic Indian Burmese meditation teacher with schools in 
India, Europe, North America, and Asia, was reportedly 
critical to drumming up enough support among Burmese and 
other Theravada Buddhists around the world to bolster 
attendance numbers.  The meditation teacher was rewarded at 
the Summit with extensive publicity for his schools, and 
future economic benefits are likely for his son -- a Rangoon 
businessman. 
 
Comment: Another Feather in the SPDC Cap 
 
7. (SBU) Nothing of major doctrinal significance emerged from 
the three days, only a blandly worded joint communique that 
called for further propagation of Buddhist teachings around 
the world.  The real story was the face-saving \"success\" of 
the Summit for the SPDC after losing its co-sponsor.  Over 
the past few years, the SPDC has made it a priority to host 
as many international conferences and Summits as possible; 
gaining strength and confidence from each one that gets good 
attendance and uncritical rhetoric.  On top of this, the 
completed Buddhist Summit was successful enough to justify, 
in their minds, the SPDC leadership\'s self-appointment as 
defender of the faith.  Meanwhile, the regime\'s cynical 
support of Buddhism (rewarding monks for their political 
support and jailing those who refuse SPDC patronage) and 
patently \"un-Buddhist\" behavior continue to make most pious 
Buddhists here cringe with disgust.  End comment.

Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  According to the NLD, in the pre-dawn hours 
of December 14 GOB police officials required the departure of 
ASSK\'s entire contingent of personal bodyguards from the 
compound where she resides under house arrest.  In recent 
weeks, the GOB has increasingly restricted access to ASSK and 
the NLD is concerned that it no longer has the ability to 
monitor her status on a daily basis.  The NLD plans to issue 
a statement holding the GOB fully responsible for ASSK\'s 
health and welfare.  We do not see any evidence that ASSK 
faces imminent danger, but the departure of her bodyguard is 
troubling and should the situation persist, appropriate 
Washington interventions and/or statements may be advisable. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On December 14 NLD Spokesman U Lwin requested a 
meeting to inform us that the GOB had issued orders requiring 
the departure of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s entire personal bodyguard 
(a contingent of 13 young, loyal male supporters who are not 
NLD members) from the University Avenue compound where she is 
held under house arrest. 
 
3. (C) According to U Lwin, the Burmese Police Special Branch 
(SB) officers who recently joined military intelligence (MI) 
in overseeing the compound have become increasingly rigid 
toward ASSK and her supporters (ref B).  In late November, 
authorities limited ASSK\'s personal physician to thrice 
weekly visits, a reduction from the daily access he has had 
since she was placed under house arrest in September 2003 
(ref A).  In subsequent weeks, the physician has been subject 
to random searches and interrogation.  More recently (U Lwin 
did not specify when), SB officials informed ASSK that she 
would have to reduce her personal bodyguard from thirteen 
members to six.  ASSK refused because, U Lwin explained, the 
entire contingent is required to fill shifts for 24-hour 
coverage at the compound. 
 
4. (C) In the pre-dawn hours of December 14, SB officers 
demanded that the NLD send a mid-level party member to ASSK\'s 
house to escort the members of the bodyguard, who were 
present at the time, off the compound.  The NLD party member 
then drove the bodyguards to a Rangoon bus depot where most 
of them continued on to their hometowns (it is illegal to 
stay in Rangoon overnight at a private residence without 
registering with authorities).  GOB security personal, 
according to U Lwin, will henceforth prohibit access to the 
compound by any members of her personal bodyguard. 
 
5. (C) With the departure of the personal bodyguards, only 
two supporters remain inside the compound with ASSK: a 
trusted female NLD member who serves as a house manager and 
the NLD member\'s daughter who helps out with housekeeping.  A 
combination of SB and MI personnel continue to maintain a 
presence outside the compound, which sits on the edge of a 
small lake in central Rangoon. 
 
6. (C) According to U Lwin, the NLD is drafting a statement, 
which the party plans to issue o/a December 16, that 
expresses serious concern about the situation at ASSK\'s 
compound and holds the GOB fully responsible for her health 
and welfare.  The NLD is concerned that with the departure of 
ASSK\'s personal bodyguard, and the restrictions imposed on 
her physician, the party no longer has the ability to monitor 
her status on a daily basis.  In addition to informing the 
U.S. mission about the new development, NLD leaders have also 
spoken to several other Rangoon diplomats as well as U.N. 
Special Envoy Razali\'s local liaison. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  Emboffs have arranged to meet with NLD CEC 
members on December 16 for an update on the situation and, in 
the interim, we are seeking an opportunity to discuss with 
ICRC the need for that organization to press for regular 
access to ASSK (as far as we know, the ICRC has not been able 
to see ASSK for at least a year).  Furthermore, the COM has 
previously requested meetings with the Ministers of Foreign 
Affairs and Home Affairs, at which we had planned to raise a 
number of issues including once again our concerns about 
ASSK\'s prolonged detention.  We will renew our requests for 
those meetings and, should they materialize, we will also 
address the December 14 development at her compound.  At this 
point, the NLD CEC has not requested assistance or action 
from the USG.  We do not see any evidence that ASSK faces 
imminent danger, but the departure of her bodyguard is 
troubling and should the situation persist, we may recommend 
appropriate Washington interventions and/or statements.  End 
Comment.

REF: RANGOON 1587 
 
Classified By: DCM Ron McMullen for reason 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  The SPDC has increased its restrictions on 
Aung San Suu Kyi by reducing the visits of her doctor to one 
time a week, prohibiting the doctor from contacting NLD 
members, and tailing her housekeeper as she leaves the 
compound for grocery shopping.  In short, ASSK is now being 
held incommunicado; the NLD is concerned and feeling the 
heat.  We recommend the Department issue a statement that the 
regime will be held solely responsible for Aung San Suu Kyi\'s 
well-being.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) NLD Dismayed:  The Chairman and Secretary of the NLD 
met with Emboffs December 16 at NLD HQ in Rangoon.  They 
provided a copy of the party press statement decrying the 
further isolation of and restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi\'s 
residential compound.  The statement calls the regime to task 
for unilaterally changing the modalities for access and 
security at ASSK\'S compound.  (Translated excerpts to be 
e-mailed to EAP/BCLTV.)  While they voiced concerns about the 
tightened access to their leader, they were not fearful that 
the regime would do her physical harm.  Rather, their 
concerns ran to her uncertain health condition, whether she 
had sufficient funds with which to buy food, and, most 
importantly, the lack of communication between her and the 
party. 
 
3.  (C) Doctor Further Restricted:  ASSK\'s personal 
physician, whose access had recently been cut from daily to 
thrice weekly, has had it further reduced to one visit a 
week.  Moreover, he can no longer drive his personal vehicle 
into the compound and is, as reported reftel, subject to 
random searches by security personnel.  He is not allowed to 
see NLD Chairman Aung Shwe or other senior party leaders. 
(Note: Emboffs have taken the precautionary step of 
voluntarily and temporarily halting our heretofore frequent 
contacts with the physician.  End Note.) 
 
4.  (C) What\'s In That Bag of Rice?  The only person with 
unimpeded movement into and out of ASSK\'s house is her 
housekeeper, U Aung Shwe mentioned.  When she goes out 
shopping the police follow her to ensure she is only 
shopping.  NLD Secretary U Lwin said he didn\'t know if ASSK 
has sufficient funds with which to buy food.  (Note: During 
previous instances of long-term house arrest ASSK sold 
household furnishings to purchase food.  End Note.) 
 
5.  (C) Who Do you Call?  The NLD leaders expressed their 
uncertainty about who is calling the shots concerning ASSK\'s 
detention.  They previously had quite good communications 
with Military Intelligence officers in charge of ASSK\'s 
compound, but MI has now been replaced by unknown Special 
Branch policemen.  U Lwin commented that he sometimes 
utilized his own regular MI minder to pass messages to the 
authorities, \"but three days ago he disappeared,\" U Lwin 
concluded with a wry chuckle. 
 
6.  (C) Other NLD Issues:  Chairman Aung Shwe told us that 
about 40 NLD political prisoners had been among those freed 
in the three batches of GOB prisoner releases; approximately 
103 NLD members remain imprisoned, he said, including former 
CEC members U Win Tin and U Khin Maung Swe.  He also 
mentioned the dire financial straits of the NLD\'s medical, 
infant, educational, and prisoner support social welfare 
programs.  (Septel forthcoming on this issue.)  While neither 
the Chairman nor the Secretary said they felt an increase in 
regime pressure on them personally, they noted that active 
regime prosecution of the NLD is ongoing, particularly in 
Irrawaddy and Sagaing Divisions. 
 
7.  (SBU) Recommended Statement:  Post recommends the 
Department issue a statement to the effect that we will hold 
the Burmese military regime wholly responsible for Aung San 
Suu Kyi\'s well-being, given the increased isolation and 
restrictions placed on her by the regime.  Aung Shwe said 
such a statement would be helpful and could be issued 
immediately, but asked that the USG hold off other action 
until the NLD gets a clearer picture of the situation. 
 
8.  (C) COMMENT:  During much of ASSK\'s long periods of house 
arrest she has been in more or less constant communication 
with the rest of the party\'s leadership.  Her preference was 
to use a bodyguard as a courier or, if that option was not 
available, by means of messages passed via her doctor.  Thus, 
she managed to maintain direct leadership of the 
(superficially moribund) party structure even while under 
house arrest.  That may no longer be the case, and the NLD 
leaders at party HQ are concerned what this portends for the 
party\'s future.  End Comment.

PROVISIONING ASSK 
 
1. (C) As of December 20, new arrangements for ensuring Aung 
San Su Kyi\'s (ASSK) access to food reportedly had been 
instituted.  A designated individual who has served a similar 
role in the past is to bring food for ASSK and the two women 
who remain with her in the compound each morning at 0900 
hours.  Provisions are to be dropped off at the compound 
gate.  No correspondence or communication will be allowed 
between this individual and anyone at ASSK\'s residence (i.e., 
a grocery list).  Prior to allowing this arrangement to 
proceed, a Special Branch Officer located at the compound 
required the individual buying and transporting ASSK\'s 
groceries to fill out a personal history questionnaire 
identifying his name, address and the names and addresses of 
family members, this despite his history as having served in 
this capacity first in 1995 and most recently in the 
aftermath of the regime-orchestrated May 30th attack on ASSK 
and her supporters.  We anticipate that this new arrangement 
will proceed without interference. 
 
MORE ARRESTS 
 
2. (C) Separately, four former NLD members (Ba Tint, Ba 
Myint, Aung Moe San and Ma Theingi) were arrested in Rangoon 
on December 19 for being in possession of and/or having 
written \"objectionable material\" (NFI).  The four individuals 
all were part of a group of 20 NLD members who were suspended 
by the NLD Central Executive Committee (CEC) in September 
after taking part in an unauthorized demonstration outside 
the UNDP office (ref C).  Although there have been prior 
arrests (two separate) instances in other divisions this 
month, these are the first arrests of pro-democracy activists 
in Rangoon. 
 
 
PRISONER RELEASES 
 
3.  (C) On December 12, 6 NLD youth members (Aung Myo Win, 
Nyi Nyi Naing, Myo Aung, Soe Than, Aung Myat Min and Soe Moe) 
were released from Mawlamyaing Prison after serving seven 
years.  Of the 14,218 prisoners the GOB claims it has 
released in three tranches since November 18, approximately 
80 can reasonably be described as security detainees of some 
sort, including perhaps 50 straightforward political 
prisoners.

1. Embassy Rangoon\'s submission for the annual 
terrorism report follows.  Post will update the final 
section of this short statement when GOB provides 
requested information. 
Burma 
Burma maintained its solid position against 
international terrorism in 2004. The regime 
previously enacted an anti-money laundering law that 
could help block terrorist assets if and when fully 
implemented. The military government is fighting 
several low-intensity conflicts against ethnic 
insurgents. 
The junta has occasionally sought to portray 
insurgent attacks against infrastructure such as 
bridges and pipelines as terrorism, but there were no 
known acts of international terrorism during 2004. 
Several improvised explosive devices exploded or were 
discovered in various locations in Burma in 2004. 
There were no credible claims of responsibility for 
these acts. In December an improvised explosive 
device exploded in Rangoon, injuring one person. The 
perpetrators\' identity and motives are unclear. 
According to United Nations information, Burma is 
party to or a signatory of nine of the 12 
international conventions and protocols relating to 
terrorism. 
 
2.  This additional information is keyed to para 15 
of reftel. 
a.  GOB has cooperated in various counter-terrorism 
and security issues, such as continuing to keep 
closed the major street fronting the chancery and by 
providing armed police at the chancery and other

REF: 12/27 EMBASSY-CA TASK FORCE EMAIL 
 
1. Rangoon awoke on Sunday the 26th to a 5.3 earthquake, the 
largest since 1958 in the capital, testimony to the vast 
power of the quake off Indonesia.  Though there were no 
reports of casualties or major damage in Rangoon, there were 
scattered reports throughout the area of slightly damaged 
buildings.  The state-run media was predictably tight-lipped 
about the quake, as the SPDC leadership views any natural 
disaster as a bad omen for its continued rule.  However, 
without context, the December 27th papers carried reminders 
of what to do during an earthquake. 
 
2. According to eyewitness reports and the GOB\'s Ministry of 
Hotels and Tourism, Burma\'s most heavily touristed beach 
areas -- west of Rangoon on the Bay of Bengal -- were not hit 
by particularly large waves, though the undertow was 
significant.  There were no reports of any damage, injuries, 
or deaths in these areas.  However, coastal areas of 
southeastern Burma -- near the Thai border -- had high waves. 
 A foreign press report claimed that six or seven locals were 
killed in that area, however, Rangoon businessmen with 
interests there said they\'d heard of damage to buildings and 
bridges but not of any casualties.  A Ministry of Hotels and 
Tourism official told us that there were eight or nine 
pleasure craft, carrying foreigners, including Americans, in 
this area but that he had not heard of any problems.  The

2nd. 
 
3. UNOCAL\'s Rangoon office reported no damage to the offshore 
Yadana natural gas platform, located in far southeastern 
Burma, nor to the onshore pipeline facility.  Both are 
operated by France\'s Total, but UNOCAL is a member of the 
operating consortium.  As a precaution the platform stopped 
pumping gas for 3.5 hours beginning at 7:40 am on the 26th, 
but was back to normal production by noon.

     B. SECSTATE 273476 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: It is evident now that Burma\'s remote 
coastal and delta regions suffered at least several dozen 
casualties and, at the village level, significant property 
damage from the earthquakes and tsunami of December 26th, 
although the full extent of the impact is still unclear.  As 
of COB December 28th, there are no reports of any Amcit dead 
or missing.  Remarkably, the GOB, always reluctant to admit 
any problems in the Golden Land, has publicly announced 
deaths and damage in coastal regions, although official 
figures are considerably lower than UN and NGO estimates.  UN 
agencies and the Red Cross are assessing the situation and 
have offered assistance, though the GOB has yet to request 
any outside aid.  No matter how bad it gets here, and the 
death toll will almost certainly climb, we are doubtful the 
government will ask for international help.  End summary. 
 
Government Admits a Problem 
 
2. (U) The GOB has taken the unusual step of announcing 
publicly that there were casualties in Burma due to the 
earthquakes and subsequent tsunami of December 26th. 
According to the December 28th edition of the mouthpiece 
daily \"The New Light of Myanmar,\" Burma was hit by nine 
earthquakes between 7:30 a.m. and 9:30 am on the 26th with 
resulting damage to buildings in six of Burma\'s 14 
administrative regions.  The most significant damage occurred 
in \"coastal regions,\" where, according to the GOB, 34 people 
were killed, 45 injured, and 25 are still missing.  The GOB 
reported that tidal waves destroyed 17 villages in this same 
area, leaving 200 people homeless.  The newspaper account 
noted that GOB officials were visiting damaged townships in 
the delta region and offering unspecified \"necessary 
supplies.\" 
 
3. (SBU) The GOB official numbers are at variance with those 
of several UN sources who, as of December 28th, offered 
estimates as high as 57 deaths -- 20 in southern Tanintharyi 
Division, bordering Thailand, and 37 in the Irrawaddy River 
delta region southwest of Rangoon.  According to additional 
UN sources, the GOB has not requested international 
assistance and thus UN efforts are focused on assessment. 
The International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) remains 
the coordinating agency for any international relief efforts 
in Burma, though UNDP is poised to take over that function 
should the situation worsen. 
 
4. (SBU) The official GOB numbers also differ from those 
given us informally by a government source who claimed there 
are 56 dead and 92 injured in southern Tanintharyi Division 
alone.  In addition, a Myanmar Red Cross source told UN 
officials that he thought there could be as many as 90 dead 
in the Irrawaddy delta zone, though he admitted this number 
was based on informally gathered information. 
 
No Amcits Reported Missing 
 
5. (U) There have not been any reports of missing or dead 
American citizens in Burma.  The areas apparently hardest hit 
by the earthquakes and high seas, which include hundreds of 
delta and coastal islands, are quite remote and mostly 
untouristed.  Dive boats launched out of Phuket in southern 
Thailand are known to frequent waters in southernmost Burma, 
but we have received no reports of boats or foreign tourists 
missing in these areas.  As mentioned in reftel, and 
corroborated by business and UN contacts, there was little or 
no damage to the major tourist beach areas west of Rangoon on 
the Bay of Bengal. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: The number of deaths will likely rise over 
the next several days as UN field officers and NGO workers 
report in from remote locations.  There is very poor 
communication with remote delta settlements and with islands 
in the archipelago along the far southeastern coast.  The 
number of itinerant fishermen in these heavily fished areas 
is also unknown.  Whatever the ultimate toll, we expect the 
GOB to understate any future official accounts of the 
disaster.  In addition, we would be surprised if the GOB made 
any requests for international aid no matter how high the 
toll climbs.  End comment.

1. (SBU) Summary: As of December 29th, the GOB\'s official 
earthquake/tsunami death toll in Burma is 51 dead and 70 
missing, though the real numbers may be higher.  There have 
been no reports of Amcit casualties or verified cases of 
missing Americans.  The GOB has declined offers of assistance 
from international organizations, stating that it is still 
assessing the impact of the December 26th events and that it 
has the capacity to deal with the situation.  Rangoon 
experienced yet another earthquake in the early hours of 
December 29th, considerably smaller than the December 26th 
quake, but there were no casualties or damage reported.  End 
Summary. 
 
The Toll Rises 
 
2. (SBU) Three days after the December 26th earthquakes and 
tsunami, the GOB increased its official tally of dead, 
 
SIPDIS 
missing, and injured in the country.  The Minister of Home 
Affairs told the Chief of Mission (COM) on December 29th that 
at latest count there were 51 dead and 70 missing.  In a 
December 28th statement, the Deputy Information Minister 
announced that in addition there were 45 injured and 788 
homeless.  Some UN sources believe these numbers are 
understated, but the UN\'s top representative in Burma says he 
has seen no evidence to contradict the GOB\'s overall 
assessment.  A UNDP assessment mission dispatched to the 
remote regions of the Irrawaddy delta is expected to report 
back to Rangoon on December 30th. 
 
3. (U) Most of the dead, missing, and injured are located in 
the far southeastern coastal region of Tanintharyi Division, 
on the Andaman Sea, and in the Irrawaddy delta region 
southwest of Rangoon (on the Gulf of Martaban, Andaman Sea). 
Unverified press reports also claim 10 dead fisherman in the 
Bay of Bengal.  However, as previously reported by Embassy 
Rangoon (ref B), and contrary to the Department\'s public 
announcement of December 28th (ref C), we have received 
several reports (including from Emboffs and other diplomats 
on location) that the touristed beach areas along the Bay of 
Bengal, to the west and northwest of Rangoon, have not 
suffered any casualties or major damage. 
 
Amcits are Fine 
 
4. (U) There have been no reported American citizen 
casualties to date.  Embassy Rangoon\'s consular section has 
made inquiries as to the whereabouts of nine pleasure craft 
carrying foreigners, at sea on the 26th from the port town of 
Kawthaung, Tanintharyi Division.  According to the Ministry 
of Hotels and Tourism, all of the craft are accounted for and 
five have returned undamaged to port. 
 
GOB: No Plan and No Aid 
 
5. (SBU) The COM asked the Minister of Home Affairs whether 
the GOB would request international assistance.  He was 
vague, telling her only that the GOB was \"still waiting and 
reviewing figures and damage.\"  The GOB did not accept a 
December 27th offer of aid by the World Health Organization 
or subsequent offers by other UN agencies.  The COM also 
pressed the Minister on Burma\'s preparedness plan should a 
major earthquake strike in or near population centers in 
Burma (the country is on a major fault line).  The Minister 
demurred and seem surprised to learn from the COM and his 
subordinates that Rangoon had experienced another, minor 
earthquake at about 0330 (local) on December 29th (there were 
no casualties or damage reported from this latest quake).

1. (C) Summary:  The new Minister of Home Affairs, offering 
the first official GOB word on the current status of Aung San 
Suu Kyi\'s detention, says that ASSK and NLD Vice Chairman U 
Tin Oo are no longer considered held \"in protective custody,\" 
but rather are detained under a specific provision of law 
which allows detention without trial and prohibits any 
contact with outside parties.  The Minister also claims that 
ASSK herself had requested the recent removal of her personal 
bodyguards from her compound.  The SPDC will now claim legal 
justification for the indefinite detention of the NLD 
leaders, making it unlikely that the regime will bow to 
international pressure to free either of the two any time 
soon.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On December 29 COM and P/E chief called on the GOB\'s 
new Minister of Home Affairs, Major General Maung Oo.  The 
Minister was joined by Police Brig Gen Khin Yee, Director 
General of the Burmese Police Force, and other senior 
ministry and police officials.  We delivered a demarche on 
the USG narcotics certification process (septel), but also 
used the opportunity to raise issues related to the South 
Asian tsunami (ref A) and the ongoing detention of ASSK. 
 
3. (C) The COM pressed for an explanation as to why the GOB, 
reversing its standard description of Aung San Suu Kyi\'s 
status as \"protective custody,\" recently applied to the 
democracy leader a specific criminal charge under the 1975 
\"Law to Safeguard the State Against the Dangers of Subversive 
Elements\" (ref C).  The COM added that the new charge 
indicated the GOB now considered ASSK a threat to national 
security. 
 
4. (C) Minister Maung Oo replied that ASSK had breached 
specific provisions of the law (NFI) and declared that the 
GOB \"should have taken this action from the beginning,\" 
meaning after the May 2003 assault on her convoy and 
intimating that the SPDC blamed former Prime Minister Khin 
Nyunt and his military intelligence apparatus for 
inappropriate handling of ASSK\'s case.  He also said that 
under the provisions of the law, specifically Section 10(b), 
ASSK is not allowed to receive visitors, depart her compound, 
or have any written or phone communications with other 
parties. 
 
5. (C) The COM expressed concern over ASSK\'s detention as 
well as that of NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo and other 
pro-democracy party members.  In response to COM\'s questions, 
the Minister said that U Tin Oo is also held under the same 
section of the law (Note: Under Section 10(b) the GOB can 
hold an individual without trial for up to one year, which 
the Minister for Home Affairs can prolong for another year 
and the Chairman of the SPDC can extend for an additional 
five years.  End Note). 
 
6. (SBU) On the basis of the Home Minister\'s implicit 
acknowledgment that the GOB plans to hold ASSK in detention 
for at least another year, as well as recent information that 
her access to medical care and personal security staff has 
been restricted (ref B), the COM stated the United States 
holds the Burmese government solely responsible for her 
safety and security. 
 
7. (C) Minister Maung Oo replied that ASSK \"is well protected 
and she even has better security than I do.\"  He said that 
the GOB \"is in close contact with her and she is able to 
inform our security people of all her needs.\"  He further 
claimed that ASSK herself had requested the removal of her 
entire personal bodyguard.  \"Although Section 10(b) does not 
have a provision for security,\" he said, \"we allowed her to 
keep six bodyguards at the compound, but she refused.\" 
(Note: A December 17 Reuter\'s article also made the claim 
that ASSK had removed all of her personal bodyguards, in 
protest over the GOB\'s decision to cut the contingent in 
half.  An Embassy source who has had contact with ASSK 
corroborated this information.  End Note.) 
 
8. (C) The COM pressed Minister Maung Oo to specify what 
measures the GOB had taken to ensure ASSK\'s safety and, given 
the specific legal charge against her, to explain whether the 
ICRC would have access to her, like any other prisoner. 
Maung Oo demurred on detailing any GOB security measures, but 
reiterated that under Section 10(b) ASSK was not allowed 
contact with any outside parties.  \"The ICRC will not have 
access to Aung San Suu Kyi at this moment,\" he intoned. 
 
9. (C) Comment: Maj Gen Maung Oo\'s acknowledgment that ASSK 
is now detained under Section 10(b) was the first official 
GOB word on the topic since the NLD revealed on December 1 
that the SPDC had extended her house arrest (ref C). 
Further, his information that U Tin Oo is also held under 
Section 10(b) is news.  Neither development bodes well for 
the two democracy activists.  The SPDC, hiding under the 
veneer of its own Orwellian laws, will claim legal 
justification for the indefinite detention of the NLD 
leaders, making it unlikely that the regime will bow to 
international pressure to free either of the two any time 
soon.  End Comment.

1. Summary: All USG personnel in Burma are accounted for and 
safe.  There have still been no reports of Amcit casualties 
or verified cases of missing Americans.  There was no new 
information on casualties in Burma on December 30th, though a 
UN team found little evidence to dispute GOB claims of 
December 29th of 51 dead, 45 injured, and 70 missing.  The 
GOB is still not asking for assistance, but may be willing to 
accept it if the situation worsens.  End summary. 
 
USG Personnel Safe and Sound 
 
2. All USG personnel at Embassy Rangoon, including local 
staff, are accounted for and safe.  The Consular Section is 
currently working to resolve about 50 American Citizen 
welfare and whereabouts inquiries -- many of them quite 
general in nature.  There have still been no reports of Amcit 
casualties or verified cases of missing Americans. 
 
No New Information, But Situation Seems Stable 
 
3. After only two days of minimal coverage, the GOB\'s 
mouthpiece newspaper, \"The New Light of Myanmar,\" has stopped 
publishing stories about the impact of the earthquakes and 
tsunami in Burma.  However, it has expanded its reprinting of 
 
SIPDIS 
wire stories detailing the death and destruction in the 
region.  The December 30th edition did print a small 
notification of an earthquake of 3.0 on the Richter scale, 
centered on Rangoon in the early hours of December 29th 
(reftel).  In the absence of any official update, the GOB 
tally remains 51 dead, 45 injured, 70 missing, and 788 
homeless. 
 
4. A UNDP team has returned from the Andaman Sea coastal 
Irrawaddy River delta, southwest of Rangoon, reporting that 
the region was hit by the tsunami, but found no evidence to 
contradict the GOB\'s public assessment of minimal damage and 
casualties limited to several dozen killed.  Another UN 
source told us that his GOB contacts were maintaining their 
initial claim of little damage and few casualties from 
Tanintharyi Division in the far southeast of the country.  A 
Rangoon businessman with tourist interests in that area 
repeated his earlier assessment that there was no serious 
damage to that area due to high waves.  However, there was an 
unverified rumor that about 100 fishermen were still missing 
from that region.  We reiterate that the touristed beach 
areas on the Bay of Bengal west and northwest of Rangoon 
received no damage and travel to those areas is as normal. 
 
GOB Might Accept Aid, But Won\'t Ask 
 
5. According to the senior UN representative in Rangoon, the 
GOB is not asking for any international assistance, but may 
be willing to accept it if proffered.  He said UN agencies 
were proceeding under that assumption and would provide 
assistance as necessary when assessments were complete.  No 
known international organizations have yet been able to see 
firsthand the conditions on remote islands of the Irrawaddy 
delta or along Burma\'s southeastern coast.  These areas are 
not frequented by foreign tourists, however.

1. (SBU) Summary: A preliminary Red Cross report on the 
extent of the damage in Burma gives figures higher than the 
GOB\'s official tally, but still quite low compared to 
Thailand.  UN agencies and NGOs are continuing their 
assessments and small-scale relief operations, however the 
GOB is not likely to make a formal request for aid.  There 
are no reports of Amcit casualties or verified cases of 
missing Americans in Burma.  End summary. 
 
IFRC: Death Toll Higher Than Reported 
 
2.  (SBU) The International Federation of the Red Cross 
(IFRC), coordinating the international community\'s response 
to the tsunami and earthquake damage in Burma, released a 
preliminary report on December 30th collating the information 
collected to date from various agencies\' missions to the 
impacted parts of the country.  According to the report, the 
\"verified\" toll in Burma is 86 dead, 45 injured, 10 missing, 
and 6,250 homeless. 
 
3. (SBU) As reported ref B, the most heavily damaged parts of 
the country are the Irrawaddy River delta southwest of 
Rangoon (47 dead, 4,500 homeless), and the southeastern coast 
(just north of Ranong, Thailand) in Kawthaung, Tanintharyi 
Division (27 dead, 1,750 homeless).  The IFRC report further 
corroborated previous reporting (ref B) that the tourist 
beach areas on the Bay of Bengal (west and northwest of 
Rangoon) were not damaged.  IFRC officials noted that various 
NGOs and UN agencies were planning or now undertaking 
additional assessment trips by air, sea, and road to more 
remote areas of the Irrawaddy delta and islands off the 
Tanintharyi coast. 
 
Assessment and Aid Distribution Ongoing 
 
4. (SBU) Though the GOB has not made a formal request for 
aid, the IFRC noted that UN agencies, international NGOs, the 
Myanmar Red Cross, and, to a lesser extent, the GOB were 
providing basic assistance and emergency shelter in the 
worst-hit areas.  According to IFRC officials, an appeal for 
funds to assist in Burma would be integrated into the general 
UN \"Flash Appeal\" for all countries affected by the 
earthquake/tsunami.  This appeal is reportedly to be launched 
on January 5th. 
 
Americans are Safe 
 
5. (U) Embassy Rangoon\'s Consular Section has been working to 
clear remaining welfare/whereabouts inquiries. 
There have still been no reports of American Citizen 
casualties or verified cases of missing Americans.

GOODWILL 
 
REF: A. RANGOON 1647 AND PREVIOUS 
     B. RANGOON 1612 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1. (U) The GOB announced on January 2nd that it had released 
5,588 additional prisoners from jails around the country. 
The release announcement was scheduled to precede the January 
4th Independence Day holiday.  Unlike the three prior mass 
releases (ref B) in this case the government did not claim to 
be freeing those unjustly imprisoned by former Prime Minister 
Khin Nyunt\'s Military Intelligence (MI).  Instead, the 
announcement cited the SPDC\'s \"loving-kindness and good will\" 
and desire to rehabilitate prisoners who have exhibited good 
behavior. 
 
2. (SBU) Details are still sketchy about exactly how many 
prisoners are actually free, and the number of political 
prisoners included in the 5,588.  However, initial reports 
indicate that the following political prisoners (all listed 
in the December Amnesty International report) were among 
those freed on January 2nd or 3rd: 
 
-- Aung Myint (aka Pyapon Ni Lone Oo), a well-known poet and 
journalist arrested in 2000 for issuing a statement 
protesting the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and sentenced 
to 21 years. 
-- Kyaw Khin, an NLD MP-elect from Shan State arrested in 
1996 for allegedly having tapes of anti-government messages 
and sentenced to 10 years. 
-- Thein Dan, an NLD Divisional Executive Committee Member 
from Mandalay arrested in 1991 for writing an article 
criticizing the GOB\'s shooting of demonstrators and sentenced 
to 17 years. 
-- Myint Soe (aka Johnny, aka Kyaw Oo), an NLD Youth member 
from Rangoon arrested in 1990 for discussing the formation of 
a parallel government and sentenced to 17 years. 
 
The GOB also released Saw Tin Soe, a Karen National Union 
member from Karen State arrested in 1983 and sentenced to 
death (later changed to 25 years) for attempted hi-jacking. 
 
3. (SBU) The steady trickle of political prisoner releases 
over the last several months is a good thing.  However, the 
numbers remain very small considering nearly 1,400 such 
prisoners remain behind bars.  Furthermore, the releases pale 
a bit when examined in the context of ongoing arrests and 
harassment of NLD members (ref B) and the GOB\'s recent 
decision to further tighten the imprisonment conditions of 
NLD leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and U Tin Oo (ref A).

1. (C) Summary:  The new Home Affairs Minister, Maj Gen Maung 
Oo, Burma\'s top counterdrug official, took our recent drug 
certification demarche in stride, blaming ousted Prime 
Minister Khin Nyunt for not sharing counterdrug intelligence. 
 He said the GOB now must \"start from zero\" in combating 
money laundering and other drug-related crimes.  The Minister 
and his senior aides indicated that the SPDC has approved the 
2005 U.S.-Burma joint opium survey, but the designated lead 
agency, Military Affairs Security (MAS - the successor 
organization to the defunct Office of the Chief of Military 
Intelligence - OCMI), is unproven at delicate relations with 
the former insurgents who rule poppy growing territory.  The 
Minister, a former military commander in Rakhine State, 
struck us as confident and fairly well-informed.  End Summary. 
 
Certification Demarche Delivered 
 
2. (SBU) On December 29 COM and P/E chief met with the GOB\'s 
new Minister of Home Affairs, Major General Maung Oo, to 
deliver reftel demarche on the USG narcotics certification 
process.  The Minister was joined by Police Brig Gen Khin 
Yee, Director General of the Burmese Police Force, and other 
senior ministry and police officials.  We provided the 
Minister a non-paper based on Department\'s guidance for Burma 
(ref A) as well as the general certification information. 
(Note: in line with USG Burma policy that prohibits direct 
assistance to the GOB, we excised the language in the Burmese 
specific guidance (ref A) that read: \"The USG will seek to be 
responsive to your government\'s requests for drug control 
assistance.\"  End note.) 
 
Get the Big Fish 
 
3. (U) The COM emphasized that the GOB had to take action 
against major drug traffickers, citing druglord Wei Hseuh 
Kang as an example, in order to demonstrate a serious 
commitment to counterdrug efforts.  The COM suggested that 
arrests of complicit senior officials and convictions under 
money laundering provisions of the law would be important 
steps.  She noted that the GOB has implicated former Prime 
Minister (and former military intelligence chief)  Khin Nyunt 
for corrupt activities in notorious drug trafficking areas, 
but observed that there have been no convictions of any 
senior officials since his October ouster. Minister Maung Oo 
claimed that the GOB was also looking for Wei Hseuh Kang and 
had no idea where he is located. \"Please give us any 
information that you have on him,\" he added. 
 
 
Pointing Fingers at the Ousted Guy 
 
4. (SBU) Minister Maung Oo said that the Ministry of Home 
Affairs was handling an investigation of the ousted Prime 
Minister.  \"We have not yet found anything regarding Khin 
Nyunt\'s involvement in narcotics,\" he said, \"but please 
provide us with any evidence if you have it.\"  Contrary to 
SPDC declarations that there would be no policy changes 
following Khin Nyunt\'s ouster, Maung Oo said, \"you will see 
an increased focus on combating corruption.\" Maung Oo went on 
to say \"Whether you believe it or not this ministry received 
nothing from the former military intelligence on drug-related 
crimes...now we have to start from zero.\" 
 
5. (U) Police Colonel Sit Aye, head of the GOB\'s new 
Financial Investigation Unit (FIU), said that the FIU had 
received over 3,000 financial transaction reports and 20 
property transaction reports since the implementation of new 
money laundering regulations (ref D).  The FIU, he said, was 
investigating four of the transactions as suspicious, as well 
continuing an investigation of two Burmese banks named by the 
U.S. Treasury Department as probable money-laundering 
institutions. 
 
Green Light for 2005 Joint Opium Survey? 
6. (SBU) The COM outlined the importance of continuing the 
joint U.S.- Burma opium surveys and urged the minister\'s 
support in obtaining GOB approval for the next survey, 
tentatively scheduled for February 2005.  Minister Maung Oo\'s 
immediate response was that \"all bilateral issues must now be 
coordinated through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\" 
However, when we noted that the joint opium survey involved 
considerable logistical coordination and pressed for an 
operational point of contact (a role previously played by 
OCMI), Police Brig Gen Khin Yee replied, \"in fact, the 
authorities have already been briefed and they have approved 
the joint survey, including the use of (Burmese Army) 
helicopters.\"  He added that MAS (as the successor to OCMI), 
will coordinate the 2005 survey and urged contact with the 
new chief, Rangoon Division Commander Maj Gen Myint Swe. 
Minister Maung Oo nodded in agreement. 
Not Our Problem 
 
7. (SBU) We also raised the issue of the United Wa State 
Army\'s (UWSA) poppy-free deadline of June 2005 and inquired 
what the GOB planned to do if the Wa failed to meet the 
deadline.  Minister Maung Oo, who spent three years posted in 
the northern Shan State region, said \"the deadline is a Wa 
resolution, not a GOB one, and if they don\'t keep their word, 
it\'s their problem.\"  He noted that the GOB\'s own poppy-free 
deadline is 2014, \"and the GOB will do its best to comply, 
with or without international assistance...we will keep our 
word.\" 
 
Comment:  Notorious, but Connected 
 
8. (C) The apparent go ahead for the 2005 joint opium survey 
is a positive development, although it is uncertain if the 
new MAS apparatus is capable of the undertaking.  The survey 
is a political and logistical challenge, requiring delicate 
negotiations with former insurgent groups in Shan State. 
 
9. (C) This was our first encounter with Maj Gen Maung Oo, 
the former military commander of the Western Command in 
Rakhine State who replaced Khin Nyunt confidant Col Tin 
Hlaing as Home Affairs Minister in early November (ref C). 
Maung Oo, who enjoyed a reputation for brutality when he was 
in his former post, struck us as confident and fairly 
well-informed.  While his appointment has been perceived as a 
turn for the worse by UN agencies and NGOs, he demonstrated 
the ability to speak authoritatively on relevant issues (ref 
B), a welcome departure from many cabinet ministers who demur 
or defer to senior SPDC \"decision makers\" when discussing the 
most mundane of topics and decisions.  End Comment.

Classified By: CDA a.i. Ron McMullen for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Democratic opposition groups held their 
annual January 4th Independence Day celebrations despite a 
negative SPDC response to a December demand for dialogue 
before the holiday.  The observances were well attended and 
seem to indicate a unity of purpose among the different 
groups.  With the opposition\'s private threat of forming a 
parallel government and the SPDC\'s public threat of legal 
action looming, we will see if this unity of purpose leads to 
unity of action.  End summary. 
 
The SPDC Responds to Ultimatum 
 
2. (SBU) To mark Burma\'s 57th Independence Day on January 
4th, the SPDC issued its usual statements about unity, the 
importance of the military\'s role, and the necessity to march 
towards \"a modern, developed, and discipline-flourishing 
democratic nation with the seven step policy.\"  It also 
issued a response, through a planted article in the January 
5-11 edition of newspaper \"The Flower News,\" to a December 2, 
2004 NLD ultimatum to Senior General Than Shwe (ref B) to 
begin a dialogue with the NLD by January 4th, \"or else.\"  The 
ultimatum noted that the Committee Representing the People\'s 
Parliament (CRPP) -- a loose consultative group of opposition 
groups -- had endorsed the NLD\'s position. 
 
3. (SBU) The SPDC response was predictably dismissive.  The 
article accused the NLD once again of \"destructionist\" 
tactics and of threatening to use the \"outlawed\" CRPP as \"a 
weapon.\"  It continued by noting the SPDC had generously 
allowed the CRPP to exist despite its legal status, but that 
the regime would have no choice but to take legal action \"at 
any time\" if the CRPP and NLD moved to form a parallel 
government (ref A).  Furthermore, the article asserted, the 
\"People would never accept\" such a move. 
 
Opposition Reiterates Call for Dialogue 
 
4. (SBU) The NLD and the Veteran Politicians group held their 
separate annual Independence Day events as scheduled.  The 
NLD marked the holiday at its headquarters in Rangoon.  A 
crowd of perhaps 200 members attended the function, packing 
the dilapidated building and spilling out onto the sidewalk 
and street.  NLD Secretary U Lwin gave a keynote address that 
was moderate to gentle in tone.  The NLD and allied parties\' 
ultimatum to the SPDC, and the regime\'s indirect and negative 
response produced no follow-on call for action.  Six 
diplomatic missions attended the NLD event (United States, 
Australia, Japan, the U.K., France, and Germany).  After the 
function diplomats spontaneously lined up for a group pose 
for the bevy of Military Intelligence paparazzi engaged in a 
snapping frenzy across the street.  The NLD crowd roared with 
laughter and applauded the move. 
 
5. (SBU) The Veteran Politicians, the remaining elders from 
the original independence movement and first (and last) 
democratic government in the 1950s, held a similar event 
across town with speeches on the history of Burma\'s 
independence movement -- both pre and post-1948.  The keynote 
address publicly endorsed the NLD/CRPP position that a \"clean 
slate\" and open dialogue between the government and the 
democratic parties were needed to break the political 
deadlock.  Despite the large crowd in attendance, the United 
States was the only diplomatic mission to send a 
representative -- much to the excitement of the three still 
and one video photographer sent by MI. 
 
Comment: Unity of Purpose, But Little Leverage 
 
6. (C) Despite no inclination from the SPDC to sit down with 
the NLD, the Independence Day events, particularly the 
Veteran Politicians\' ceremony, appeared to signify a new 
unity of purpose to push the regime for dialogue.  Both 
observances were better attended than in previous years by 
the various opposition \"factions:\" the NLD leadership, the 
more aggressive NLD youth movement, as well as ethnic 
political leaders.  With the deadline passed for a positive 
SPDC response to the ultimatum, and with the threat of \"legal 
action\" looming, we will see if this apparent unity of 
purpose engenders unity of action.  End comment.

1. (U) Summary: According to NLD sources, the GOB released 
about 20 political prisoners as part of an amnesty of 5,588 
prisoners on January 2nd.  Among those released were Zaw Thet 
Htwe (a journalist sentenced to death in 2003), two NLD 
MP-elects (including Ohn Kyaing, a famous journalist), two 
NLD members arrested after the May 30, 2003 attack on Aung 
San Suu Kyi, and two students in prison since the massive 
anti-government demonstrations of 1988.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) As reported in ref A, in honor of Independence Day 
(January 4th) the SPDC ordered on January 2nd the release of 
5,588 prisoners from around the country -- bringing the total 
number of releases since mid-November to 19,906 (ref C). 
Most of the prisoners were released after serving their full 
sentences with time off for good behavior.  The NLD has told 
us that of those freed about 20 were imprisoned for their 
politicial activities. 
 
3. (U) Most notable among the latest released prisoners was U 
Zaw Thet Htwe, the editor of a sports newspaper \"First 
Eleven,\" who was originally sentenced to death in 2003 for 
plotting against the government (his sentence was reduced in 
May 2004 to 3 years).  In reality, many suspect he was 
arrested because he reported about GOB misuse of 
international sports funds.  According to the NLD, the 
following political prisoners were freed in the latest 
tranche: 
 
From Rangoon\'s Insein Prison: 
 
-- Zaw Thet Htwe 
-- Aung Myint (aka Pyapon Ni Lone Oo), a journalist and poet 
from Mandalay arrested in 2000. 
-- Mya Soe (aka Shwe Gyo), a Rangoon NLD Youth leader 
arrested in 2003. 
 
From Magway Division\'s Thayet Prison: 
 
-- Kyaw Khin, a NLD MP-elect from Shan State arrested in 1996. 
-- Thein Tan, a NLD Mandalay Division Executive Committee 
member arrested in 1991. 
-- Myint Soe (aka Johnny, aka Kyaw Oo), a NLD Youth member 
from Rangoon arrested in 1990. 
 
From Sagaing Division\'s Shwebo Prison: 
 
-- Aung Myint, a NLD member from Shwebo arrested in the 
aftermath of the regime\'s attack on Aung San Suu Kyi and her 
convoy on May 30, 2003. 
-- Khin Maung Latt, a NLD member from Shwebo arrested in the 
aftermath of the May 30, 2003 ambush. 
 
From Bago Division\'s Taungoo Prison: 
 
-- Ohn Kyaing (aka Aung Wint), a NLD MP-elect from Mandalay 
and well-known journalist arrested in 1991. 
 
From Mandalay\'s Myingyan Prison: 
 
-- Soe Thaung, a Rangoon university student arrested in 1997. 
-- Aung Myat (aka Aung Myat Htut), a Rangoon university 
student arrested in 1989. 
-- Maung Maung, a lawyer from Irrawaddy Division arrested in 
1989. 
 
From Bago Division\'s Shwedaung Prison: 
 
-- Pho Paw (aka Than Tin Oo), a student arrested during 
demonstrations on September 9, 1999 (9/9/99). 
-- Maung Maung (aka Hein Htet Aung), a student arrested on 
9/9/99. 
-- Bala (aka Ye Kyaw Lin), a student arrested on 9/9/99. 
 
From Sagaing Division\'s Katha Prison: 
 
-- Than Aung, arrested in 2003 for writing a welcome poster 
for Aung San Suu Kyi during her travels. 
From Kachin State\'s Myitkyina Prison: 
 
-- Myo Nyunt, from Rangoon. 
-- Thein Lwin, from Myitkyina, arrested in 1999. 
-- Than Naing, from Kachin State, arrested in 1999. 
 
The GOB also released Saw Tin Soe, a Karen National Union 
member from Karen State arrested in 1983 and sentenced to 
death (later changed to 25 years) for attempted hi-jacking.

REF: A. RANGOON 9 AND PREVIOUS 
 
     B. 04 RANGOON 959 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Contravening recent press reports 
questioning the low number of reported dead and missing in 
Burma, the UN issued a report on January 5th stressing that 
it appears Burma was largely \"spared.\"  According to the 
report UN, Red Cross, and NGO missions in the affected areas 
have not found widespread death and destruction but estimated 
that more than 10,000 people need emergency and medium-term 
assistance.  There have still been no reports of American 
Citizen casualties or verified cases of missing Americans in 
Burma.   End summary. 
 
UN Report: Initial Assessments Complete 
 
2. (SBU) The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Burma 
released a report on January 5th compiling results from 
various field missions in tsunami-impacted regions of Burma. 
UN agencies, alongside the Red Cross and international NGOs, 
have conducted and are conducting a number of assessments in 
the Irrawaddy River delta (southwest of Rangoon), Tanintharyi 
Division (in the far southeast, north of Ranong, Thailand), 
and Rakhine Division (on the Bay of Bengal west and northwest 
of Rangoon).  Initially the missions sought to collect 
figures on casualties and damage but are now beginning to 
focus more on determining \"immediate to medium term needs.\" 
 
3. (SBU) There was no update to the International Federation 
of the Red Cross\'s (IFRC) December 30th assessment of 
casualties (ref A).  However, according to the UN report the 
earthquake and tsunamis affected 10,000 people in the 
Irrawaddy River delta and \"several thousand more\" in 
Tanintharyi Division.  These people are in \"immediate need of 
food, water, basic health assistance and shelter.\"  Two 
hundred more villages along Burma\'s southern coast may 
require aid to repair some \"economic impact\" of the tsunamis. 
 Additionally, the report noted, the deaths of \"hundreds\" of 
Burmese fishermen in Thai waters will have negative economic 
consequences for their families in Burma. 
 
4. (SBU) The UN analysis was clear that with the information 
available to date, it appears that Burma was \"spared.\"  It 
suggested that the Andaman Islands and Burma\'s own sparsely 
populated barrier Myeik Archipelago absorbed the brunt of the 
waves before they came ashore on the mainland.  The UN 
Resident Coordinator in Burma, in an attached letter, urged 
readers of the report to resist \"misreporting\" and 
exaggerating the extent of the damage lest the GOB, \"very 
sensitive to how events in Myanmar are portrayed by the 
international community,\" stops cooperating with the UN on 
this and other humanitarian operations around the country. 
Though the GOB is downplaying the affects of the tsunamis, it 
has been much more transparent during this crisis (issuing 
regular updates on casualties) than it was during massive 
flooding in July 2004 when it made no public announcements 
and arrested people for filming the devastation (ref B). 
 
Assistance is Needed 
 
5. (SBU) For now, the IFRC will continue to coordinate the 
international community\'s response.  Assessment missions are 
continuing in the impacted areas and UNCT members have begun 
to re-allocate existing country resources for use in the 
tsunami-impacted parts of the country.  These efforts will 
 
SIPDIS 
focus on water and sanitation, food support, emergency 
shelter, healthcare, and economic and psychological support. 
Though the GOB has still not made any request for 
international aid, the UN agencies will seek additional 
resources through \"their respective regional appeal 
mechanisms.\" 
 
6. (U) Embassy Rangoon\'s Consular Section continues to work 
through about 50 welfare/whereabouts inquiries. 
There have still been no reports of American Citizen 
casualties or verified cases of missing Americans.

1. (SBU) Summary: The UN briefed diplomats on January 6th on 
the results of recently completed assessment missions to 
affected parts of Burma.  These surveys were conducted 
without any GOB interference and did not discover any areas 
of massive damage or death -- though the teams have not yet 
visited all areas hit by the tsunamis.  The UN estimates \"at 
most\" 15,000 people were \"impacted\" in one way or another. 
UN agencies are providing emergency and medium-term 
assistance and have asked for USG assistance in providing 
satellite imagery of the Burmese coastal regions.   End 
summary. 
 
UN Tries to Set Record Straight 
 
2. (U) The UN Country Team (UNCT) in Burma and the 
International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) held a 
briefing for diplomats on January 6th to try and further 
dispel rumors of mass devastation and death in the country 
due to the December 26th earthquakes and tsunamis.  Teams 
from the Red Cross, various international NGOs, the World 
Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF, and ICRC have had unfettered 
access to the impacted regions of Burma -- though they have 
not yet visited all potentially affected villages and 
islands. 
 
3. (SBU) The GOB has not made any official request for aid, 
but is \"willing to accept international assistance.\"  In 
response to this, the PRC government on January 5th donated 
$200,000 directly to the GOB.  UN officials have asked us for 
our assistance in providing satellite imagery of unvisited 
areas to help in their assessments and for planning future 
missions (septel).  Aside from this request, the UNCT has not 
made any appeal to us or other bilateral donors specifically 
for Burma relief.  The UN is folding Burma into the regional 
appeal launched on the 6th in Jakarta.  UN sources told us 
that once further assessments are complete, the UN and IFRC 
may make specific appeals for Burma.  However they would 
probably broaden the requests to include money for general 
development work in areas not directly affected by the 
earthquakes and tsunamis. 
 
Tally is Stable, Though Some Uncertainty Remains 
 
4. (SBU) The IFRC, which is coordinating the international 
community\'s response in Burma, released on January 5th a 
revised matrix of the extent of the damage in Burma based on 
the various field missions.  This update revised downward the 
number of homeless to 5,272 from 6,250 on December 30th as 
some people have rebuilt their homes or moved in with family 
members.  The WFP, the lead UN agency for the tsunami 
response, estimates at most 15,000 people \"impacted\" in one 
way or another by the tsunamis. 
 
5. (SBU) The IFRC\'s estimates of dead, injured, and missing 
remain, for now, 86, 45, and 10 respectively.  However, the 
IFRC passed on unverified reports from Tanintharyi Division 
in southeastern Burma that 25 additional fishermen may have 
been killed and 200 houses destroyed on a yet unvisited 
island northwest of Kawthaung.  It is possible the number of 
missing may also be higher since it is unclear exactly how 
many fishing boats were in coastal Burmese waters at the time 
of the tsunamis. 
 
Americans are OK 
 
6. (U) Embassy Rangoon\'s Consular Section continues to work 
through remaining welfare/whereabouts inquiries. 
There have still been no reports of American Citizen 
casualties or verified cases of missing Americans.  Travel to 
touristed beach areas on the Bay of Bengal west and northwest 
of Rangoon was not disrupted by the tsunamis.  Local travel 
agents offering package trips to the islands of Tanintharyi 
Division have said they are operating as normal.

major casualties, UN sources admit that difficult travel

impossible for these teams to cover all areas of potential 
impact (especially those islands, such as the Cocos, deemed

(Executive Orders and Sanctions Regulations) 
 
2. Summary: Under U.S. law, new U.S. investment in Burma has 
been prohibited since 1997.  Sanctions imposed in 2003 ban 
imports of Burmese products into the United States and 
forbid all financial transactions between U.S. persons and 
Burma.  Burma is a country blessed with extensive natural 
resources, low labor costs, and great potential for tourism. 
It is also a member of ASEAN.  However, even if U.S. 
sanctions were removed, an extraordinarily hostile 
investment climate would hold U.S. investment - as it has 
held all other foreign investment - to a very low level. 
 
Though local investment laws are liberal on the surface, 
their implementation is racked, at all levels, with 
corruption.  The ruling military junta, the State Peace and 
Development Council (SPDC), despite pledging itself to an 
\"open door\" economic policy and urging foreign firms to 
invest, regularly comes out with punitive and capricious 
regulations, which make investment for foreigners difficult 
if not impossible.  The senior generals making the decisions 
rarely consider the law when they take action for or against 
investors. 
 
Our view of the current investment climate is very dim.  We 
have not seen any movement toward reform in recent years and 
expect none in the next year.  In fact, if recent events are 
any indication, the situation for investors could well 
become worse before it improves. End summary. 
 
3. Preface:  U.S. Investment Subject to Sanctions 
 
On May 20, 1997, by Executive Order 13047, the President 
imposed economic sanctions prohibiting new investment by 
U.S. persons or entities in Burma (Myanmar).  Those 
sanctions were based on the President\'s determination that 
the Government of Burma has committed large-scale repression 
of the democratic opposition.  The Cohen-Feinstein Amendment 
to the Foreign Operations Act of 1997 formed the legal basis 
for the investment ban.  The U.S. government every six 
months reviews sanctions policy.  Since the investment ban 
was imposed in 1997, the State Department has found no 
measurable progress toward political liberalization in 
Burma. 
 
Prior to the imposition of the investment ban, a number of 
high-profile U.S. investors had already withdrawn from Burma 
due to a hostile investment climate and poorer than expected 
returns.  An active anti-Burma consumer movement in the 
United States and Europe caused investing in Burma to be 
high risk in terms of corporate image.  Federal sanctions 
ban new investment but allow companies invested in Burma 
prior to May 20, 1997 to remain. 
 
In 2003, the President signed into law the Burmese Freedom 
and Democracy Act and issued an accompanying executive order 
barring imports of Burmese products into the United States. 
The 2003 sanctions also prohibited U.S. persons from 
providing financial services to Burma and seized the assets 
of certain Burmese entities.  The 2003 and 1997 economic 
sanctions are in addition to a number of sanctions the 
United States imposed against Burma following the military 
crackdown against civilian democracy activists in 1988 and 
the nullified election of 1990.  The United States opposes 
the extension of international financial institution 
assistance to Burma, prohibits military sales, denies 
bilateral economic aid and all commercial assistance 
programs, bans the issuance of U.S. visas to members of the 
military, political, and economic elite, and has downgraded 
our representation in Rangoon from Ambassador to Charge 
d\'affaires.  In addition, the United States continues to 
engage in a vigorous diplomatic effort to promote political 
and human rights reforms. 
 
U.S. commercial policy toward Burma is to neither encourage 
nor discourage U.S. exports. 
 
4.  Openness to Foreign Investment 
 
With a view to attracting foreign investment, the Burmese 
government instituted the Foreign Investment Law (FIL) on 
November 30, 1988.  The basic priorities of foreign 
investment, according to the FIL, are as follows: 
 
Promotion and expansion of exports; 
Exploitation of natural resources that require heavy 
investment; 
Acquisition of high technology; 
Support for production and services requiring large amount 
of capital; 
Expansion of employment opportunities; 
Development of facilities that would reduce energy 
consumption; and, 
Regional development. 
 
According to the State-Owned Economic Enterprises Law, 
enacted in March 1989, state-owned enterprises have the sole 
right to carry out the following economic activities: 
 
Extraction of teak and sale of the same in the country and 
abroad; 
Cultivation and conservation of forest plantations with the 
exception of village-owned firewood plantations cultivated 
by the villagers for their personal use; 
Exploration, extraction, sale, and production of petroleum 
and natural gas; 
Exploration, extraction, and export of pearls, jade and 
precious stones; 
Breeding and production of fish and prawns in fisheries 
which have been reserved for research by the government; 
Postal and telecommunications services; 
Air transport and railway transport services; 
Banking and insurance services; 
Broadcasting and television services; 
Exploration, extraction, and exports of metals; 
Electricity generating services other than those permitted 
by law to private and cooperative electricity generating 
services; and, 
Manufacturing of products relating to security and defense. 
 
However, the law provides that the Myanmar Investment 
Commission (MIC) may, \"in the interest of the State,\" make 
exceptions.  Exceptions have been made in areas such as 
banks (though not for foreign investors), petroleum and 
natural gas extraction, and air services.  This discretion, 
though, like most else resides in the hands of the Cabinet 
and senior generals. 
 
According to the FIL, the MIC must review all potential 
investment, either foreign or domestic.  However, due to 
corruption within the MIC, the ruling State Peace and 
Development Council (SPDC) removed much of the MIC\'s real 
influence at the end of 1999.  Potential investors must 
still work through the MIC, but it has lost the authority to 
make a decision.  Interested foreign companies still 
approach and submit proposals through the MIC, which in turn 
gets approval from either the Cabinet (chaired by Prime 
Minister Lt. General Soe Win, though the PM must get 
clearance from SPDC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe)) or 
the Trade Policy Council (TPC, chaired by SPDC Vice Senior 
General Maung Aye).  The Cabinet and the TPC have the same 
membership so the choice of decision-making body is made on 
a case-by-case basis.  Though the MIC has no power or 
authority to protect foreign companies, we have no evidence 
of overt discrimination by the MIC against foreign 
investors. 
 
Once the government grants permission to invest, a foreign 
company must get a \"Permit to Trade\" - essentially a 
business license - from the Ministry of National Planning 
and Economic Development\'s Directorate of Investment and 
Companies Administration (DICA).  In a typical \"Catch 22\" 
that has for all intents and purposes closed Burma to most 
new foreign investment, since February 2002 the government 
is no longer permitting DICA to issue new permits or renew 
existing ones for foreign firms.  This decision has 
disrupted the business of many foreign investors, and forced 
closure of several foreign manufacturing firms.  In an 
effort to overcome this obstacle, since 2002 some foreign 
investors that have attempted to do business as local firms 
under cover of Burmese partners have faced legal action and 
difficulties divesting. 
 
In theory once a company has the \"Permit to Trade\" it may 
then use it to get residence visa status, lease cars and 
real estate, etc., and to get import and export licenses 
from the Ministry of Commerce.  The Ministry of Commerce has 
had a policy in place since the end of 2001, though there is 
nothing in writing, to only issue import licenses to those 
firms who are export earners.  Companies without export 
earnings must purchase \"export dollars\" from another firm at 
an inflated exchange rate in order to apply for an import 
license. 
 
The FIL allows for FDI as a wholly foreign-owned venture or 
a joint venture with any Burmese partner (private or state- 
owned).  Sole proprietorships or partnerships are equally 
acceptable.  Overall, the FIL requires that at least 35 
percent of equity capital in all JVs and partnerships be 
foreign-owned.  The minimum foreign investment required in 
practice, though not specified in the law, for manufacturing 
investments is $500,000 in cash or kind.  In addition, the 
minimum cash-on-hand requirement in foreign currency 
(calculated at the official rate of exchange of roughly 5.6 
kyat = $1) is 300,000 kyat for a services company, 500,000 
kyat for a trading company, and 1 million kyat for a 
manufacturer. 
 
The military, via the military economic enterprises, the 
Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd. (MEHL) and the Myanmar 
Economic Corporation (MEC), is involved in many economic 
activities.  To set up a joint venture, foreign firms have 
reported that it is useful to be affiliated with MEHL or MEC 
in order to receive the proper business permits. 
Nonetheless, entering into business with MEHL or MEC does 
not guarantee success for the foreign partner, and some 
foreign investors report that their military partners are 
parasitic, making unreasonable demands, providing no cost- 
sharing, and sometimes muscling out the foreign investor 
after an investment is profitable. 
 
5.  Conversion and Transfer Policies 
 
According to the Foreign Investment Law (FIL), investors in 
Burma have a guarantee that they can repatriate profits 
(after taxes).  The law also provides that, upon expiry of 
the term of the contract, the investor of foreign capital 
has the right to the foreign currency in which the 
investment was made.  However, due to the shortage of 
foreign exchange it is in reality not easy for foreign 
investors to legally transfer their net profits abroad. 
Foreign currency can be transferred abroad only after 
obtaining permission from the Foreign Exchange Management 
Department of the Central Bank of Myanmar. 
 
Likewise, multiple exchange rates in Burma make conversion 
and repatriation of foreign exchange very complex and ripe 
for corruption.  The official rate of about 5.6 kyat to the 
dollar is grossly overvalued.  The government issues Foreign 
Exchange Certificates (FEC) that trade somewhat closer to 
the market rate (roughly 930 kyat = $1 at the end of 2004) 
but are still overvalued.  Generally speaking, companies get 
rid of kyat earnings as quickly as possible.  The government 
requires foreign companies to use dollars or FEC to pay 
utility and telephone bills (charged at a higher rate than 
for local firms), and rental charges.  The government allows 
foreign firms to deposit dollars in a state bank for 
withdrawal as FEC by the company\'s employees. 
 
In Burma, only three state banks, the Myanma Foreign Trade 
Bank (MFTB), the Myanma Investment and Commercial Bank 
(MICB) and the Myanma Economic Bank (MEB) are allowed to 
deal with foreign exchange transactions.  In practice the 
MFTB and MICB handle most of these transactions.  The MFTB 
mainly handles foreign currency transactions of government 
organizations, businesses, and individuals, and the MICB 
caters primarily to companies and joint ventures.  MEB 
handles foreign currency transactions in border trade 
regions. 
 
Restrictions on provisions of financial services by U.S. 
banks have caused a serious disruption to the legal foreign 
trading system, which has long been primarily dollar- 
denominated.  U.S. banks no longer offer trade facilitation 
or correspondent banking services, making the use of U.S. 
dollar letters of credit problematic.  Traders and 
government banks have shifted to euros as much as possible. 
 
As of July 29, 2003, the correspondent accounts of MEB, 
MFTB, and MICB in the United States are frozen, along with 
all other assets and property. 
 
Private banks had assumed a large share of banking activity 
before a major banking crisis in February 2003 effectively 
closed the private banking sector.  However, at no point 
were these banks permitted to deal in foreign exchange.  In 
2004 the government allowed some of the smaller private 
banks to resume operations, though the sector remains 
moribund.  There is no indication that if the private 
banking system is revitalized it will be given the right to 
deal in foreign currency. 
 
6.  Expropriation and Compensation 
The Burmese Foreign Investment Law (FIL) guarantees against 
nationalization during the investment\'s \"permitted period\" 
of investment.  However, a number of foreign firms in 
various sectors have been forced to leave the country when 
the terms and conditions of their investment agreements have 
not been honored.  In the late 1990s, two large Japanese 
firms exited Burma after they found they were not able to 
operate as they had been led to believe.  Additionally, 
there have been cases where the government has seized the 
assets of foreign and local investors (without 
compensation), when the investment turned out to be very 
profitable. 
 
The most recent example we know of is the case of a Swiss 
cement importer and distributor that was forced out 
ostensibly because it was not operating according to its 
permit.  In reality, the government turned the company out, 
after it had made a significant investment in plant and 
equipment, because it was able to sell better quality, 
cheaper cement than its government-controlled competitors. 
In another case in 1999-2000, the government confiscated a 
large brewery that an expatriate Burmese businesswoman had 
made profitable and turned it over to the Ministry of 
Industry (1).  The local courts were not helpful and the 
investor was unable to get compensation from the GOB. 
 
7.  Dispute Settlement 
 
Private and foreign companies are at a disadvantage in 
disputes with governmental and quasi-governmental 
organizations.  Arbitration is addressed under the 1944 
Arbitration Act.  Foreign investors generally prefer to use 
international arbitration, though the Burmese government 
will try to stipulate local arbitration in contracts it 
signs with foreign investors.   If arbitration is handled 
locally, difficulties arise since the central leadership 
controls the whole legal mechanism.  The courts are not 
independent and cannot make free and fair decisions.  There 
is no recourse available for companies who face an adverse 
administrative decision.  Burma is not a member of the 
International Center for the Settlement of Investment 
Disputes nor is it a party to the New York Convention. 
 
The legal system in Burma is ostensibly under the control of 
the Attorney General\'s Office and the Supreme Court. 
However, neither the Attorney General nor the Supreme Court 
is independent.  Burmese criminal and civil laws are modeled 
on British law as practiced during the colonial period, 
which ended in 1948.  Every Township, State, and Division 
has its own law officers and judges.  However, the township, 
state and divisional SPDC branches have supreme authority 
over judicial decisions at the local level. 
 
There is no bankruptcy law in Burma. 
 
Foreign companies have the right to bring cases, and defend 
themselves, in local courts.  However, as the SPDC ruling 
junta controls all the courts, foreign investors who have 
had conflicts with the local government, or even had their 
business illegally expropriated, have had little luck 
getting compensation. 
 
8.  Performance Requirements and Incentives 
 
Officially, companies covered under the Foreign Investment 
Law (FIL) are entitled to a tax holiday period of three 
consecutive years.  Under the law this tax holiday can be 
extended with permission of the Myanmar Investment 
Commission (MIC).  Investors are also eligible, at the MIC\'s 
discretion, for a number of other incentives including: 
accelerated depreciation of capital assets, a waiver of 
customs duties and taxes on imported machinery and spare 
parts during the period of construction, or on imported raw 
materials during the first three years of commercial 
production, etc.  Though the MIC issues the permission, the 
TPC and the Cabinet, not the MIC, make decisions on these 
incentives and extensions. 
 
There are no official performance requirements for new 
foreign investors in Burma, but the government does require 
an investor purchase local machinery, fire, marine, and 
personal liability insurance.  Unofficially, the government 
often requires companies to commit to a certain level of 
exports before being allowed to invest.  The government then 
requires compliance reports every three months with evidence 
of export or explanation why the goals were not met.  We 
have no evidence that action is taken against firms that do 
not meet their initial export targets. 
There is no requirement that foreign investors buy or hire 
from local sources.  Technology transfer is not generally a 
pre-requisite for investment. 
 
Any enterprise operating under the FIL or the Myanmar 
Companies Act must pay a 30 percent income tax rate. 
Withholding tax on royalties and interest is 15 percent for 
resident foreigners and 20 percent for non-resident 
foreigners.  Tax collection in Burma is very lax, but 
foreign investors are an easy target for the cash-strapped 
tax authorities.  The Burmese fiscal year ends March 31 and 
tax returns are due by June 30. 
 
A surprising reversal of the government\'s mantra of \"open 
door economy\" came in a February 2002 verbal directive which 
outlawed the issuance of new, or renewal of existing, 
\"Permits to Trade\" for trading firms owned by foreigners (or 
by foreigners and Burmese).  This was done ostensibly to 
promote local trading firms, but has served only to further 
distort the local marketplace.  The authorities have not 
published any official notice of this directive but it is 
being enforced, including against foreigners who have tried 
to evade the directive by listing their company under the 
name of a Burmese colleague or friend. 
 
9.  Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
 
By law, foreigners may not own land, and may only rent 
property on a short-term basis. 
 
A private entity can establish, buy, sell, and own a 
business only with the review and approval of the MIC (and 
by proxy the top leadership). 
 
10.  Protection of Property Rights 
 
Burma does not yet have adequate IPR protection.  Patent, 
trademark, and copyright laws and regulations are all 
deficient.  Nonetheless, the GOB has stated it will meet its 
WTO TRIPS obligations before 2006.  After Burma joined ASEAN 
in 1997, it agreed to modernize its intellectual property 
laws in accordance with the ASEAN Framework Agreement on 
Intellectual Property Cooperation.  However, an IPR law, 
first drafted in 1994, still awaits approval and 
implementation.  A Patents and Design Act was introduced in 
1946, but never brought into force.  Thus the Indian Patents 
and Designs Act of 1911, which was enacted under British 
colonial rule, continues to govern the registration of 
patents and designs. 
 
Piracy of music CDs, video CDs, CD-ROMS, DVDs, books, 
software, and designs is evident nationwide, especially in 
the border regions and in the two major urban centers of 
Mandalay and Rangoon.  However, given the small number of 
customers (most Burmese are too poor), and the lack of 
adequate infrastructure (e.g., reliable electricity), we do 
not believe piracy has a significant adverse impact on U.S. 
products, which, are in any case, not readily available.  We 
assume that most if not all consumers of IT products, 
private and governmental, are using pirated software. . 
 
Burma has no trademark law, though trademark registration is 
possible.  Some firms place a trademark caution notice in 
the local English newspaper, declaring ownership of their 
trademarks.  Once this notice has been published, criminal 
and/or civil action can be taken against trademark 
infringers.  Title to a trademark depends on use of the 
trademark in connection with goods sold in Burma.  While a 
Copyright Act was promulgated in 1914, no means to register 
a copyright was ever instituted.  There is thus no legal 
protection in Burma for foreign copyrights. 
 
In the vast majority of cases, real estate is purchased with 
cash or using regular bank loans, though the latter are 
difficult to obtain (and not available directly to 
foreigners). 
 
11.  Transparency of the Regulatory System 
 
Burma is notorious among foreign businesspeople for its 
complete lack of regulatory and legal transparency.  All 
existing regulations, including those covering foreign 
investment, import-export procedures, licensing, foreign 
exchange, etc., are subject to change, with no advance 
notice, at the whim of the senior ruling generals.  The 
economic decision-makers here are influenced strongly by 
whimsy, wealthy cronies, the demands of state-owned 
enterprises, and of the military-controlled Myanmar Economic 
Corporation and the Myanmar Economic Holdings, Ltd.  The 
government also regularly issues new regulations with no 
notice and with no opportunity for review or comment by any 
non-governmental domestic or foreign market participants. 
Furthermore, new regulations or regulatory changes are 
rarely published.  Instead, they are communicated verbally 
to interested parties.  If a new regulation or law is 
published it will appear in the government\'s mouthpiece 
newspaper, the New Light of Myanmar (Myanma A\'Lin) or in the 
Burma Gazette. 
 
Burma\'s health, environmental, tax, and labor laws as 
written do not impose a major burden on investment. 
However, the protean nature of the regulatory and legal 
situation - and the irregular enforcement of existing laws - 
makes investment tricky without good, and well-connected, 
local legal advice. 
 
See \"Openness to Foreign Investment\" section for further 
details of the legal and regulatory system. 
 
12.  Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
 
Burma has no true equity or debt markets, and the notion of 
portfolio investment is not well understood by the average 
person.   Burmese authorities have said in the past that the 
existence of capital markets is essential for the 
development of a well-functioning financial system.  To this 
end, the Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB) and Japan\'s Daiwa 
Institute of Research Co. Ltd. established a joint venture, 
the Myanma Security Exchange Centre Ltd., to set up a stock 
exchange.  This exchange is in existence, though moribund, 
with only one listed company - a forestry joint venture.  A 
few companies have also begun to sell bonds privately and on 
a very small scale.  Private companies, both foreign and 
domestically controlled, are generally small and thus their 
shares are closely held by a small number of people or 
entities - often within a family.  There is no securities 
law. 
 
A large bank run in February 2003, and the subsequent 
decision by the government to avoid bailouts, has 
effectively cut off the private banking system from the 
market. The state-owned and semi state-owned banks were not 
impacted by this crisis.  Though a few of the smaller 
private banks resumed their operations in 2004, government 
instructions and internal bank policies have made it 
impossible for the largest private banks to take in new 
deposits or loans, and weekly withdrawals are capped.  The 
future of these banks is uncertain. 
 
Burma remains on the Financial Action Task Force\'s (FATF) 
list of non-cooperating countries and territories for 
failures to enact an adequate anti-money laundering regime. 
The U.S. Treasury Department, in April 2004, issued a rule 
prohibiting U.S. banks from doing business with Burmese 
banks or their overseas branches because of concerns of 
money laundering in Burma and specifically at Asia Wealth 
Bank (the largest pre-crash private bank) and Myanmar 
Mayflower Bank.  The government announced it was 
investigating these two banks under a 2002 money laundering 
law, though no progress is evident. 
 
Foreign firms do not have access to bank loans since the 
banks require collateral of land or real estate, neither of 
which foreigners can own.  Since mid-2002 the government has 
forbidden the use of gold as collateral.  Loans in kyat are 
available for local companies and individuals from state and 
active private banks.  Interest rates are currently running 
about 15 percent per year with inflation about twice that. 
Because of these negative real interest rates, a lack of 
adequate supervision, and a shortage of banking experience 
the private banking system, even at its peak, was very 
unstable.  Private banks engaged in reckless lending and 
suffered high levels of non-performing loans.  Though 
statistics are not available, it is likely that public 
banks, forced to bankroll the regime\'s pet projects and 
personal needs, also have an extremely large percentage of 
non-performing loans. 
 
A 1990 banking law permitted foreign banks to open branches 
in Burma but not to conduct business in the local market. 
These offices may serve as a trade and commercial liaison 
for local and foreign clients.   For a variety of reasons, 
including the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, the 
slow local business climate, and the lack of liberalization 
of the banking sector, most of the original 49 foreign banks 
have left Burma, or downgraded their representation, in the 
past several years.   Under U.S. law, U.S. persons may not 
provide financial services to Burma. 
 
In 2004, in the absence of a government policy, the Myanmar 
Accountants Council issued its own standard accounting 
system - the Myanmar Accounting Standards - based very 
closely on International Accounting Standards (IAS). 
 
13.  Political Violence 
 
In May 2003, government-affiliated thugs ambushed a convoy 
carrying pro-democracy opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi 
while she was traveling in northwest Burma.  Dozens were 
killed or wounded in the attack.  Several small bombs went 
off in downtown Rangoon in early 2003 and in mid- and late- 
2004, and authorities regularly claim to discover improvised 
explosive devices in Rangoon and various locations 
throughout Burma. 
 
Burma experienced major political unrest in 1988 when the 
military regime jailed and/or killed an undetermined number 
of Burmese democracy activists.  In 1990, the military 
government refused to recognize the results of an election 
that the opposition won overwhelmingly.  Burma experienced 
major student demonstrations in 1996, and demonstrations 
occurred in August and September of 1998.  Popular unrest 
and violence continue to be possible. 
 
For the last decade there has been sporadic anti-government 
insurgent activity in various locations, such as an attack 
on a natural gas pipeline in the Tanintharyi Division and 
bomb attacks against family members of senior military 
officials in Rangoon.  The Thai-Burma border area in Burma\'s 
southern Shan, Mon, Kayah, and Kayin States and in 
Tanintharyi Division, have continue to see sporadic fighting 
between government forces and various insurgent groups.  In 
February 2001, several people were killed and some tourists 
left stranded during shelling and cross-border gunfire in 
the town of Tachileik, Shan State.  The Thai-Burma border is 
closed from time to time due to increased insurgent 
activity, most recently for a period in 2002. 
 
14.  Corruption 
 
Corruption is systemic in Burma and is considered by 
economists and businesspeople to be one of the most serious 
barriers to investment and doing business in Burma.  Because 
of the Byzantine and capricious regulatory environment, rent- 
seeking activities are rampant and very little can be 
accomplished, from the micro to the macro, without paying 
\"tea money.\"  We think this problem will only get worse at 
all levels as inflation further impoverishes government 
bureaucrats and as senior leaders seek additional income 
from a shrinking number of investment projects. 
 
Corruption is a jailable offense in Burma, and has been 
since 1948.  However, the anti-corruption statute is applied 
only when the senior generals want to take action against 
some official who has become an embarrassment - most notably 
in October 2004 when the SPDC arrested then Prime Minister 
General Khin Nyunt, and many of his family members and 
allies, for corruption.  In all other cases corruption is 
considered a very normal practice - indeed a requirement for 
survival.   The major, though by no means only, areas where 
investors run into corruption are: when seeking investment 
permission, taxation, when applying for import and export 
licenses, and, when negotiating land and real estate leases. 
 
15.  Bilateral Investment Agreements 
 
Burma has signed bilateral investment agreements, known as 
\"Protection and Promotion of Investment\" agreements with the 
Philippines, the PRC, and Vietnam.  Except for increasing 
investment from the PRC (see \"Foreign Direct Investment 
Statistics\" section), these agreements have had little 
impact on incoming investment from Vietnam or the 
Philippines. 
 
16.  OPIC and Other Insurance Programs 
 
Due to U.S. law, OPIC programs are not available for Burma. 
Burma is not a member of the World Bank\'s Multilateral 
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). 
 
17.  Labor 
 
In 1989, the United States withdrew Burma\'s eligibility for 
benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) 
due to the absence of internationally recognized worker 
rights.  Labor unions are illegal in Burma.  Workers are 
unable to organize, negotiate, or in any other way exercise 
control over their working conditions.  Although regulations 
set a minimum employment age and wage, and maximum work 
hours, these are not uniformly observed, especially in 
private factories and other establishments.  The government 
uses forced labor in infrastructure construction and 
porterage for the military in active combat zones.  These 
labor practices are not consistent with Burma\'s obligations 
under ILO Conventions 29 and 87, and thus explain why the 
ILO imposed sanctions against Burma in 2000.  The United 
States strongly supported this decision. 
 
Burma\'s cost of labor is very low, even compared to some of 
its Southeast Asian neighbors.  Burmese over the age of 40, 
and particularly those over 65, tend to be very well 
educated.  However, a sad side effect of the repeated 
closing of Burmese universities over the past 15 years is 
that the current 15-30 year old demographic is sorely 
lacking in technical skills.  Many Burmese, though, speak at 
least some level of English.  Many educated Burmese studied 
English in mission schools during the British colonial and 
early independence period.  After the nationalization of 
private and mission schools in 1964, the socialist 
government mandated English courses in school starting from 
middle school.  Soon thereafter then-dictator General Ne Win 
ordered that English instruction begin in kindergarten after 
his daughter allegedly failed an English exam and was 
rejected for studies in the U.K. 
 
The government does not publish unemployment figures. 
However, anecdotal evidence and the recent divestment by 
many foreign companies, support the assumption of a very 
high level of unemployed and underemployed in formal, non- 
agricultural sectors.  An average worker in Burma will make 
about 500-800 kyat (roughly $0.50 to $0.80) per day. 
 
18.  Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
 
The government has set aside as \"industrial zones\" 19 large 
tracts of land surrounding Rangoon, Mandalay, and several 
other major cities.  However, these zones are merely zoned 
for industry and do not come with any investment incentives. 
 
There are no free trade zones in Burma. 
 
19.  Foreign Direct Investment Statistics 
 
Note:  Investment figures compiled by the Burmese government 
include only investment approved by the Myanmar Investment 
Commission (MIC).  The figures do not include investments 
not submitted for MIC approval, such as a myriad of small 
and medium Chinese projects.  Since the end of 2003, the MIC 
has stopped providing investment figures to other 
organizations and individuals.  Current figures are 
calculated based on the Monthly Economic Indicators 
published by the Central Statistical Organization (CSO). 
 
According to government figures at the end of March 2004, 
cumulative foreign investment approved by the MIC totaled 
379 projects, valued at $7.59 billion.  This amount is 1.2 
percent higher than the cumulative total listed at the end 
of March 2003.   However, it should be noted that this 
cumulative number does not factor in subsequent divestment, 
or investment that was approved but that did not actually 
enter the country. 
 
Extrapolating from the latest government statistics on FDI 
flow for Burmese FY 2003-04  (April-March), we estimate a 
4.6 percent year-on-year increase in the value of new FDI 
approvals ($91.17 million) in five sectors compared with 
total new investment approvals in FY 2002-03  ($86.95 
million).  The new investments came from Canada ($1.45 
million in mining), China ($2.82 million in manufacturing), 
Hong Kong ($3 million in transport), South Korea ($ 32.3 
million in oil and gas and $2.6 million in fisheries), 
Thailand ($22 million in oil and gas), and the United 
Kingdom ($27 million in transport). 
 
The trickle of approved new investment since 1997 has come 
almost exclusively from Asian countries.   Western countries 
have largely stayed away from the Burma market.  New U.S. 
investment has been zero since 1997 when the U.S. government 
imposed an investment ban. 
 
According to GOB statistics, in stock terms, the United 
States is the fifth largest foreign investor in Burma with 
16 approved projects totaling $582 million.  U.S. investment 
approved prior to May 1997, which was grandfathered under 
U.S. investment sanctions, is largely centered in oil and 
natural gas exploration.  South Korea was first in new FDI 
approvals in 2003-04 (according to Burmese government 
statistics).  These official statistics do not take into 
consideration considerable new investment, some of it state- 
financed, from the PRC. 
 
Major non-U.S. foreign investors in Burma are: Petronas 
(Malaysia), Total (France), Ivanhoe Mines (Canada), PTT, 
Plc. (Thailand), Shin Satellite (Thailand), Keppel Land 
(Singapore), Daewoo (South Korea), China National 
Construction and Agricultural Machinery Import and Export 
Co. (PRC), and the China International Trust and Investment 
Corporation (PRC). 
 
So far there is no concrete evidence of large-scale 
investment abroad by Burmese companies.  However, we believe 
that some wealthy Burmese individuals and small family 
businesses have made a few investments in neighboring ASEAN 
countries.

Comments: During office hours, the first contact would be 
through U Thaung Tun, the Director-General of the Political 
Department.  He previously served at the Burmese Embassy in 
Washington and speaks fluent English.  The Foreign Minister 
and his staff speak English, but the Foreign Minister would 
likely use an interpreter for any discussions with foreigners. 
 
2. (SBU) Comment: Due to chilly relations between the USG and 
the GOB there is little to no regular contact possible 
between the Embassy and these senior leaders.  Any requests 
for contact between the USG and the GOB (at a senior level) 
for now will likely go through the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs\' Political Department.  Military Intelligence (MI) 
has, in the past, served as the most competent liaison 
between foreign embassies and the GOB.  However, since the 
ouster of former Prime Minister (and MI Chief) Khin Nyunt, 
and subsequent dissolution of MI, which has been replaced by 
the Army\'s Military Affairs Security (MAS), the role of 
coordinating entity is still not defined.  End comment.

SUBJECT: BURMA: VICIOUS CYCLE OF ECONOMIC DESPONDENCY 
 
REF: 04 RANGOON 542 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: COM Carmen Martinez for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: One year after the GOB allowed most private 
banks to resume operations, the banking situation has 
improved little.  Stringent regulations cap deposits at 
unreasonably low levels, Burma\'s chilly economic situation 
has dried up demand for loans, and the GOB still refuses to 
implement thoughtful banking reform.  With banks so weak, and 
the GOB continuing to mismanage economic policy, a second 
crisis for the banks is possible.  End summary. 
 
Deposits are Too High 
 
2. (SBU) The GOB allowed most private banks to resume taking 
deposits in February 2004 -- a year after closing due to a 
massive bank run (reftels).  Before re-opening the banks, the 
GOB imposed several stringent new restrictions aimed at 
preventing future \"irresponsible behavior\" by bankers, but 
avoided necessary reforms.  For example, bank lending and 
deposit rates are still capped below the rate of inflation 
and private banks still cannot handle foreign exchange.  As 
expected, the impact on Burma\'s economy has been negligible. 
Three of the four largest pre-crash private banks remain 
shuttered (two, Asia Wealth and Myanmar Mayflower, suspected 
of money laundering and under investigation) and other banks 
are suffering under the new regulations combined with a very 
chilly business climate. 
 
3. (C) According to the new regulations, banks may not have 
total deposits larger than seven times paid-in capital. 
Though confidence in the banking sector is not high, deposits 
have been good over the last year.  Most of the private banks 
are quite small and long-ago exceeded the 7:1 ratio.  One 
private banker said his bank was already at a deposit-capital 
ratio of 14:1 and a colleague\'s bank was at 28:1.  The larger 
active private banks have kept their deposit ratio at 7:1 by 
periodically refusing to accept deposits from new customers. 
The GOB is taking notice of this cap busting.  At the end of 
December 2004, the GOB\'s Bank Management Committee (chaired 
by a SPDC member with no economic experience) began once 
again to call in all private bankers for nightly reviews of 
the day\'s activities and \"necessary instructions\" for getting 
in line with the regulations.  These all-hands nightly 
sessions had not occurred since March 2004. 
 
Loans are Too Low 
 
4. (SBU) The deposit problem is exacerbated, bankers tell us, 
by the low volume of new loans.  After the banking crisis of 
2003, the GOB forced private banks to call in all of their 
outstanding loans (performing or not).  These borrowers have 
not returned since lending was re-commenced in mid-2004. 
 
5. (C) This is the result of two factors.  First and 
foremost, business confidence is at an all time low.  On top 
of chronic economic mismanagement, over the last two years 
private business have faced several acute problems: a banking 
collapse, new U.S. economic sanctions, a freeze on 
agricultural exports, a hike in the cost of importing, and 
the purge of Prime Minister Khin Nyunt and his economically 
active military intelligence apparatus.  Domestic investment 
is nearly zero as most businesses refuse to make any new 
deals until the future is clearer.  Businesspeople tell us 
they are waiting for signals from the top and are reluctant 
to make any move that could later come back to haunt them. 
Even GOB projects started during Khin Nyunt\'s era have been 
halted awaiting explicit approval to continue.  None has 
come.  Businesses are expatriating their money or sticking it 
in banks or in the rice barrel hoping for better times. 
 
6. (SBU) A second factor is the regulatory environment. 
Though loans are cheap (a maximum 15 percent interest rate 
with inflation in 2004 running about 20 percent), banks can 
only lend out 35 percent of the \"forced-sale\" value of a 
borrower\'s collateral.  Furthermore, businesspeople report 
that as loans above 30 million kyat (about $33,000) require 
special reporting to the GOB, few banks or borrowers want to 
conduct such a deal and draw the attention of the 
authorities.  Even if the loans flowed again, however, 
regulations prohibit total loans of more than 70 percent of 
total deposits (or roughly five times paid-in capital).  Thus 
the volume of lending from the small banks allowed to operate 
will do little to spur the economy as a whole. 
 
Comment: A Vicious Cycle Toward Collapse? 
 
7. (C) A flourishing private banking sector is essential for 
sustainable economic growth in Burma.  However, economic 
growth is dependent on a vibrant banking system.  In this bad 
business climate with banks so poorly regulated, a vicious 
cycle has emerged.  The economy is cold so businesses are 
reluctant to borrow and invest.  Banks are not lending so 
they face difficulties staying profitable with the influx of 
deposits.  Without new lending the economy will have trouble 
reviving.  The GOB authorities do not understand the problem 
or are ignoring it.  While authorities are apparently keen to 
enforce their draconian regulations, they show no signs of 
rationalizing the industry or freeing up or restructuring the 
largest private banks.  All this points to a potential second 
private banking crisis as bank owners and investors lose 
money while being forced by the GOB to raise additional 
paid-in capital (by buying GOB bonds paying 9.5 percent) or 
turn away customers.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary:  As a result of the regime\'s increasing 
restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi, NLD party leaders report 
they now have \"absolutely no contact\" with the detained 
democracy leader.  Nothing would indicate ASSK is facing 
imminent danger.  However, the NLD\'s information is troubling 
in that the party cannot assess her well-being and has no 
ability to consult with her on strategy, a further blow to 
the pro-democracy movement.  Meanwhile the regime announced 
that the National Convention will reconvene on February 17, 
but has failed to communicate with the NLD or respond 
directly to the party\'s December letter to Chairman Than 
Shwe.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On January 13, P/E chief and Poloff called on NLD CEC 
members, including Chairman U Aung Shwe and Secretary U Lwin, 
to discuss recent developments.   U Aung Shwe said that party 
leaders no longer have any means to communicate with Aung San 
Suu Kyi at her University Avenue compound, where she remains 
under house arrest.  Under new arrangements imposed by GOB 
authorities in late December 2004 (ref B), ASSK\'s two 
household companions are prohibited from departing the 
compound to purchase food and other supplies (designated ASSK 
supporters are allowed to deliver provisions to an on-site 
Special Branch (SB) officer, but are not allowed to 
communicate with the compound residents). 
 
3. (C) Furthermore, U Aung Shwe said that the NLD had learned 
that ASSK\'s personal physician, whose access to ASSK was 
recently reduced from daily to weekly visits (ref C), is now 
further limited to only one visit per month. (Note: 
Information about the physician\'s access is difficult to 
verify as he is no longer permitted to meet with NLD leaders 
or with foreign diplomats.  End Note.)  \"We now have 
absolutely no contact with ASSK,\" said U Aung Shwe, \"and we 
remain concerned about her, particularly her health.\" 
According to mid-level NLD sources, the physician most 
recently visited ASSK o/a January 6, but was then hauled in 
for questioning by SB officers over the weekend of January 
8-9. 
 
4. (C) On a separate issue, we noted that the SPDC had 
announced that it intends to reconvene the National 
Convention (NC) on February 17.  U Lwin said that the NLD had 
received no direct overtures from the regime on any matter, 
including either the NC or a December NLD letter to Chairman 
Than Shwe (ref D).  U Lwin observed that the political 
situation remains in a status quo:  the SPDC intends to plow 
ahead without the NLD (or the pro-democracy ethnic parties) 
and secure a new constitution that enshrines a preeminent 
governing role for the military.  He added that the only 
unresolved component in the NC process remains whether the 
ethnic cease-fire groups (CFGs) agree to participate and sign 
off on a new constitution. 
 
5. (C) Comment: We have no information that would indicate 
that ASSK is facing any imminent danger or increased risk. 
We have made it abundantly clear to the GOB that the regime 
is solely responsible for her safety and security, most 
recently with the Home Minister in December (ref E). 
However, the NLD\'s information that ASSK is now facing even 
tighter restrictions is troubling.  In addition to irregular 
and unreliable information about her well-being, the party 
does not at the moment have the ability to consult with her 
about party strategy and pertinent developments, a severe 
blow to the pro-democracy movement which relies on her 
leadership and decisions.  As for the National Convention and 
the cease-fire groups, we believe it is highly probable that 
the SPDC announced a date to reconvene with a clear 
indication that at least the major CFGs intend to return to 
the table.  End Comment.
