SUBJECT:  SPAIN RECALLS AMBASSADOR FROM LIBYA IN 
-         RESPONSE TO QADHAFI\'S THREATS 
 
REF:  A) MADRID 3838, B) MADRID 3703 
 
1.  (U) THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED APRIL 10 THAT 
IT IS \"RECALLING\" ITS AMBASSADOR TO TRIPOLI FOLLOWING 
QADHAFI\'S RENEWED THREAT THE DAY BEFORE TO ATTACK U.S. 
FACILITIES IN SPAIN. 
 
2.  (C) THE MFA DESK OFFICER FOR LIBYA, JOSE MARIA 
VALDEMORO, TELLS US THAT AMB. PEIDRO WAS IN FACT 
ALREADY HERE ON VACATION WHEN THE DECISION TO RECALL 
HIM WAS TAKEN.  MFA WILL RETAIN HIM \"A FEW EXTRA 
DAYS\" TO DRIVE HOME ITS MESSAGE.  NO DECISION HAS 
BEEN TAKEN ON WHEN HE MAY RETURN TO LIBYA.  IN THE 
ABSENCE OF LIBYAN CHARGE NAKAA, THE MINISTRY 
CONVOKED THE PEOPLES\' BUREAU\'S NUMBER TWO ON APRIL 
9 TO RECEIVE A PROTEST.  IN REJECTING QADHAFI\'S 
THREATS, MFA NOTED THAT U.S. FACILITIES IN SPAIN ARE 
GOVERNED BY A BILATERAL ACCORD WHICH WOULD PREVENT 
THEIR USE AGAINST LIBYA.  THE LIBYAN DIPLOMAT RESPONDED 
THAT HIS COUNTRY HAS EXPERIENCE OF U.S. BASES FROM 
KING IDRIS\' DAYS; THE U.S. DID NOT ASK PERMISSION 
FOR PROHIBITED MISSIONS THEN AND WOULD NOT DO SO IN 
THE CASE OF SPAIN.  THE PEOPLES\' BUREAU PRESS 
SPOKESMAN HAS TRIED TO DOWNPLAY QADHAFI\'S THREATS, 
INSISTING THAT THEY ARE DIRECTED AGAINST AMERICAN 
BASES AND NOT SPANIARDS.  THIS LINE HAS NOT PROVED 
CONVINCING, HOWEVER, SINCE REPORTERS HAVE NOTED 
THAT GOS FORCES SHARE THE BASES USED BY THE UNITED STATES. 
- 
3.  (C) COMMENT.  THE TIMING OF QADHAFI\'S RENEWED 
THREAT WAS SOMETHING OF A PERSONAL EMBARRASSMENT FOR 
FOREIGN MINISTER ORDONEZ.  THE LATTER HAD APPEARED IN 
CTFGRESS THAT SAME DAY TO ANSWER AN INTERPELLATION 
ABOUT THE LIBYAN MENACE TO SPAIN.  ORDONEZ REPORTED 
THAT THE LIBYAN CHARGE HAD EXPRESSED REGRET OVER AN 
EARLIER QADHAFI THREAT, WHICH THE CHARGE ALLEGED HAD BEEN 
DISTORTED, OVERPLAYED AND TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. 
THIS EPISODE HAS AGAIN DRIVEN HOME TO THE SPANISH 
THAT QADHAFI IS MERCURIAL AND HIS GOVERNMENT\'S 
ASSURANCES ARE UNRELIABLE.  THAT IS NOT TO SAY, 
HOWEVER, THAT THE SPANISH HAVE CONCLUDED THE ONLY 
WAY TO DEAL WITH QADHAFI IS TO CONFRONT HIM.  THE 
PREVAILING ATTITUDE STILL SEEMS TO BE THAT IT IS 
BEST NOT TO ATTRACT QADHAFI\'S ANGER.

SUBJECT:  QADHAFI RETALIATES AGAINST SPANISH EXPULSIONS 
 
REF:  A) MADRID 5426, B) MADRID 5425, C) MADRID 5418 
 
1.  (C) LIBYA MAY 12 RESPONDED TO FRIDAY\'S EXPULSION OF 
ITS CONSUL GENERAL, CHARGED WITH PASSING FUNDS TO 
A SPANISH ARMY COLONEL ON THE ANTI-DEMOCRATIC RIGHT, 
BY PNG\'ING THE SPANISH COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL 
COUNSELORS IN TRIPOLI.  MFA\'S SUBDIRECTOR GENERAL FOR 
NORTH AFRICA TELLS US THAT THE GOS WILL NOT RETALIATE 
SPECIFICALLY FOR THESE EXPULSIONS; AS INVESTIGATIONS 
CONTINUE INTO THE LIBYAN ACTIVITIES HERE, HOWEVER, 
MORE EXPULSIONS ARE QUITE POSSIBLE. 
 
2.  (U) AFTER THIS MESSAGE WAS DRAFTED, WE RECEIVED 
A WIRE SERVICE REPORT QUOTING INTERIOR MINISTER 
BARRIONUEVO SAYING THAT SPAIN DID NOT PLAN ADDITIONAL 
LIBYAN EXPULSIONS. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT:  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHERE THIS SERIES 
OF EXPULSIONS AND REPRISALS IS GOING TO TAKE SPANISH- 
LIBYAN RELATIONS.  THE GOS IS DRIVEN BY TWO MUTUALLY- 
EXCLUSIVE DESIRES.  ON THE ONE HAND, IN THIS ELECTORAL 
PERIOD IT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE FAR RIGHT (WHICH IT 
HAS DONE BY PUBLICIZING THE COLONEL\'S CONNECTION TO 
QADHAFI - REF C), AND SHOW IT IS 
EFFECTIVE AGAINST TERRORISM (WHICH IT DID 
BY BAGGING THE 10-MAN \"CALL OF JESUS CHRIST\" GROUP - 
REF A).  AT THE SAME TIME THE GOS WANTS TO AVOID 
BECOMING A PRINCIPAL TARGET FOR QADHAFI BY PERSERVING 
AS MUCH OF A RELATIONSHIP AS POSSIBLE.  FOREIGN 
MINISTER ORDONEZ     PLAYED  TO THE SECOND LINE THIS 
WEEKEND WHEN HE REFUSED TO COMMENT ON LIBYAN ACTIVITIES 
HERE, SAYING \"I DON\'T WANT TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT WHICH 
MIGHT AGGRAVATE A STATE OF RELATIONS WHICH IS PASSING 
THROUGH A DELICATE MOMENT.\"  WE UNDERSTAND FROM OUR 
MFA SOURCE THAT SENIOR MINISTRY OFFICIALS MET TODAY 
TO DECIDE HOW TO REACT TO LIBYA\'S RETALIATION 
(WHICH LEAVES THE GOS EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI WITH ONLY 
3 DIPLOMATS).  THE DECISION TO DO NOTHING IS 
CONSISTENT WITH THE MINISTRY\'S LINE -- TAKEN PUBLICLY 
THIS WEEKEND -- THAT IT DOES NOT WANT TO SEVER 
RELATIONS WITH TRIPOLI.  THIS STRATEGY IS ONLY POSSIBLE 
IF QADHAFI PLAYS ALONG.

SUBJECT:  SHI\'IA TERRORISTS PARDONED BY SPANISH GOVERNMENT 
 
REF:  A) MADRID 659, B) MADRID 793 
 
1.  (U) THE GOS JULY 12 OFFICIALLY PARDONED TWO LEBANESE 
SHI\'IA TERRORISTS CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO 23 YEARS 
IN PRISON EACH FOR A BOTCHED 1984 ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 
AGAINST A LIBYAN DIPLOMAT IN MADRID.  THE TWO, MOHAMMED 
RAHAL AND MUSTAFA ALI JALIL, HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM 
SPAIN AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE LEAVING FOR LEBANON AS 
SOON AS TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE COMPLETED.  UNDER 
THE TERMS OF SPANISH IMMIGRATION LAW, RAHAL AND JALIL 
HAD TO BE PARDONED IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR 
EXPULSION AS SIMPLE UNDESIRABLES. 
 
2.  (U) THE RELEASE OF RAHAL AND JALIL WAS THE OBJECTIVE 
OF A 1984 KIDNAPPING OF THE SPAINISH AMBASSADOR IN 
BEIRUT (HE WAS RELEASED AFTER BEING HELD FOR 4 HOURS) 
AND THE JANUARY 1986 KIDNAPPING OF A SPANISH POLICEMAN 
AND TWO LOCAL HIRE EMBASSY EMPLOYEES, ALSO IN BEIRUT. 
THE RELEASE OF RAHAL AND JALIL WAS ALSO AMONG THE 
ORIGINAL SET OF DEMANDS IN THE TWA 847 HIJACKING 
(REF A). 
 
3.  (C) IN THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT, KIDNAPPERS 
(REPORTEDLY RELATIVES OF THE TWO SHI\'IA GUNMEN) HELD 
THE SPANISH POLICEMAN AND EMBASSY EMPLOYEES FOR SEVERAL 
WEEKS WHILE NEGOTIATIONS FOR THEIR RELEASE WERE BEING 
CONDUCTED.  LEBANESE JUSTICE MINISTER NABIH BERRI ACTED 
AS INTERMEDIARY IN THE TALKS BETWEEN THE KIDNAPPERS 
AND GOS INTERIOR MINISTRY SUBSECRETARY RAFAEL VERA. 
DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS, WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED 
IN THE RELEASE OF THE THREE SPANISH EMBASSY EMPLOYEES, 
CONTACTS AT MFA ADMITTED TO US THAT THE GOS HAD 
AGREED TO CONSIDER OPTIONS FOR RELEASING THE TWO 
TERRORISTS (REF B).  AT THE TIME THE THINKING WAS 
THAT RAHAL AND JALIL WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO LEBANON 
TO FINISH OUT THEIR SENTENCES THERE. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4.  (C) NO ONE HERE IS UNDER ANY ILLUSION THAT THE 
RELEASE OF RAHAL AND JALIL IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE 
QUID PRO QUO FOR THE RELEASE FIVE MONTHS AGO OF THE 
SPANISH EMBASSY HOSTAGES.  FREEING THE TWO OVER A 
SUMMER WEEKEND WILL REDUCE PUBLIC ATTENTION ON THE 
GOS MANUEVER SOMEWHAT, BUT THE MOVE IS INCONSISTENT 
WITH GONZALEZ\' PUBLIC HARDLINE ON TERRORISM AND SETS 
AN UNWELCOME PRECEDENT. 
 
5.  (U) BEIRUT MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

TAGS: PTER, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN:  1988 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 357278 
 
JUDICIAL RESPONSES AND MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
1.  SPAIN AND THE U.S. SIGNED A SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL EXTRADITION 
TREATY ON FEBRUARY 9, 1988 THAT STRENGTHENED COOPERATION 
AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM BY PROVIDING THAT ANY FUGITIVE 
CHARGED WITH A VIOLENT CRIME CANNOT DEFEAT EXTRADITION BY 
CLAIMING HIS OFFENSE WAS POLITICAL IN NATURE.  THE USG AND THE 
GOS ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING A TREATY OF MUTUAL LEGAL 
ASSISTANCE (MLAT). 
 
2.  DURING 1988, SPAIN REPEALED ITS TOUGH ANTI-TERRORIST LAW 
DUE TO A 1987 RULING COURT RULING THAT CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE 
LAW, INCLUDING A PROVISION PERMITING UP TO TEN DAYS DETENTION 
PRIOR TO THE FILING OF CHARGES, WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
HOWEVER, MOST PROVISIONS OF THE OLD ANTI-TERRORIST LAW WERE 
INCORPORATED INTO THE ORDINARY PENAL CODE.  THE NEW 
LEGISLATION, WHICH TOOK EFFECT ON MAY 26, PROVIDES THAT 
ARRESTEES IN TERRORISM CASES CAN BE HELD FOR UP TO FIVE DAYS 
WITHOUT CHARGES BEING FILED. 
 
3.  THE SPANISH COURTS DURING 1988 CONTINUED TO DEAL STERNLY, 
ALTHOUGH WITHIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS, WITH TERRORIST CASES. 
FOUR MEMBERS OF THE BASQUE TERRORIST GROUP ETA WERE SENTENCED 
ON MARCH 14, 1988 TO 74 YEARS IN PRISON FOR POSSESION OF ARMS 
AND EXPLOSIVES, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY AND BELONGING TO AN 
\"ARMED BAND.\"  ALSO ON MARCH 14, AN ETA MILITANT WAS SENTENCED 
TO 50 YEARS ON CHARGES OF MURDER, ATTEMPTED MURDER AND OTHER 
OFFENSES.  IN EARLY 1988 THE DISTRICT COURT IN MADRID, HOWEVER, 
FOUND INNOCENT FIVE ALLEGED MEMBERS OF AN ETA OPERATIONAL UNIT 
(\"COMANDO\") ON THE GROUNDS THAT \"SERIOUS DOUBT\" EXISTED 
REGARDING THEIR GUILT, AND THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE 
DEFENDANTS TO THE SPANISH NATIONAL POLICE WERE NOT \"FREELY 
GIVEN.\" 
 
4.  THE GOS ANNOUNCED ON DECEMBER 2, 1988 A 380 MILLION DOLLAR 
PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE POLICE.  ACCORDING TO DIRECTOR FOR STATE 
SECURITY RAFAEL VERA, ONE OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE PLAN IS THE 
STRENGTHENING OF ANTITERRORIST PROGRAMS, INCLUDING NEW COMPUTER 
DATABASES AND NEW EQUIPMENT FOR THE FIELD SUCH AS ARMOURED 
VEHICLES. 
 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
------------------------- 
5.  SPAIN PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN THE TREVI GROUP AND WILL BE 
TREVI PRESIDENT FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 1989.  ON DECEMBER 
8, SPAIN PROPOSED THAT THE TREVI GROUP FORM A COMMITTEE TO 
STUDY THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMEND COORDINATION OF 
LEGISLATION AND PRACTICAL SECURITY RESPONSES REGARDING THE 
OPENING OF EC BORDERS IN 1992, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO DRUG 
TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM.  THE GOS ALSO COOPERATES IN 
ANTI-TERRORIST OPERATIONS ON A BILATERAL BASIS, AS DEMONSTRATED 
BY THE JOINT U.K.-GOS EFFORT THAT RESULTED IN THE SHOOTING OF 
THREE IRA TERRORISTS IN GIBRALTAR ON MARCH 6, 1988.  THE 
TERRORISTS HAD BEEN UNDER OBSERVATION BY THE SPANISH POLICE FOR 
MONTHS BEFORE THEY ENTERED GIBRALTAR FROM SPAIN.  IN ADDITION, 
FRANCE AND SPAIN MAINTAIN A POLICE LIAISON OFFICE TO STRENGTHEN 
ANTI-TERRORIST COOPERATION. 
 
NO SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
-------------------------------------- 
6.  THE GOS DOES NOT SUPPORT, EITHER FINANCIALLY OR 
DIPLOMATICALLY, ANY INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THE 
PLO MAINTAINS A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN MADRID THAT DOES NOT 
HAVE DIPLOMATIC STATUS.  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE NATURE 
OF THIS OFFICE SINCE 1987; THE GOS DECLINED A 1987 PLO REQUEST 
FOR DIPLOMATIC STATUS.

TAGS: PTER, SP, PGOV, KPRP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN: 1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 355397 
 
1.  THE FOLLOWING REPORT IS THE ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR 
SPAIN FOR 1990.  RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS IN REFTEL. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A. PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
2.  THE TWO MAJOR TERRORIST GROUPS IN SPAIN ARE THE EXTREMIST 
BASQUE SEPARATIST GROUP EUSKADI TA ASKATASUNA (ETA), OR BASQUE 
HOMELAND AND LIBERTY, AND THE SMALLER, BUT VIRULENT, FIRST OF 
OCTOBER ANTI-FASCIST RESISTANCE GROUPS (GRAPO).  ETA HAS 
LIMITED INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS, PRIMARILY WITH BASQUES 
RESIDENT IN FRANCE, BUT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY IN 1990 FOR 
SEVERAL TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST SPANISH INSTALLATIONS IN THE 
NETHERLANDS.  GRAPO, ALSO BASICALLY A DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUP, 
HAS AT LEAST THE PUBLIC SYMPATHY OF THE GERMAN RED ARMY 
FACTION.  TWO SMALLER TERRORIST GROUPS WERE ACTIVE IN 1990: 
TERRA LLIURE, A CATALAN SEPARATIST GROUP, AND THE GUERRILLA 
ARMY OF THE FREE GALICIAN PEOPLE (EGPGC), A GALICIAN 
NATIONALIST GROUP. 
 
3.  IN A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN EARLY 1990, A HITHERTO UNKNOWN 
ETA TERRORIST NETWORK DIRECTED FROM FRANCE, KNOWN AS THE 
\"ITINERANT COMMAND,\" WAS UNCOVERED AND SEVERAL KEY LEADERS 
ARRESTED.  OVER A 12-YEAR PERIOD, THIS GROUP HAD BEEN 
RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME 40 TERRORIST BOMBINGS AND ASSASSINATIONS 
IN SPAIN.  THE DISCOVERY OF THE NETWORK BEGAN WITH THE ARREST 
OF A FRENCH BASQUE, HENRI PAROT, IN SEVILLE IN APRIL PRIOR TO A 
PLANNED ETA ATTACK ON THE LOCAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE NATIONAL 
POLICE.  AS A RESULT OF CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN SECURITY 
FORCES IN FRANCE AND SPAIN, OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ITINERANT 
COMMAND WERE LATER ARRESTED IN FRANCE. 
 
4.  NO MAJOR PROSECUTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC 
TERRORISTS WERE CONCLUDED DURING 1990.  HOWEVER, THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS CONTINUING ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND PRE-TRIAL 
PROCEDURES AGAINST MANY INCARCERATED TERRORISTS.  AS OF 
SEPTEMBER 1990, 468 MEMBERS OF ETA WERE IN PRISON IN SPAIN, 
MANY OF THEM AWAITING TRIAL.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO TAKEN 
ACTION AGAINST RIGHT-WING TERRORISTS.  SEVERAL PERSONS, 
INCLUDING A NATIONAL POLICE OFFICER, ARE IN PREVENTIVE 
DETENTION PENDING PROSECUTION FOR THE MADRID ASSASSINATION OF A 
PRO-ETA BASQUE CONGRESSMAN IN LATE 1989; AND TWO OTHER NATIONAL 
POLICE OFFICERS ARE AWAITING TRIAL ON CHARGES OF ORGANIZING AN 
EXTREME RIGHT DEATH SQUAD OF THE ANTI-TERRORIST GROUPS FOR 
LIBERATION (GAL) THAT OPERATED IN SOUTHERN FRANCE FROM 1983 TO 
1986.  AUTHORITIES OBTAINED COURT ORDERS IN JULY TO EXTEND 
THEIR PREVENTIVE DETENTION FOR TWO YEARS.  SPAIN IS ALSO 
PURSUING THE PROSECUTION OF THREE HIZBALLAH TERRORISTS ARRESTED 
IN NOVEMBER 1989 IN MADRID AND VALENCIA, DESPITE REPORTED 
WARNINGS BY HIZBALLAH SUPPORTERS IN LEBANON OF POSSIBLE 
TERRORIST ACTIONS AGAINST SPANISH TARGETS. 
 
5.  DELAYS IN PROSECUTION ARE NOT UNUSUAL FOR CRIMINAL CASES IN 
SPAIN.  THE LAW PERMITS PREVENTIVE DETENTION FOR UP TO TWO 
YEARS PENDING TRIAL; HOWEVER, EVEN THIS LIMIT ON PREVENTIVE 
DETENTION MAY BE EXTENDED IN CASES INVOLVING SERIOUS CRIMES, 
SUCH AS TERRORISM. 
 
6.  IN 1990, SPANISH COURTS CONTINUED TO DEAL STERNLY WITH 
TERRORIST CASES, SUBJECT TO CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINTS.  THE 
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS ROUTINELY SEEK STIFF PRISON SENTENCES FOR 
ACCUSED TERRORISTS.  IN TWO RECENT CASES, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
GOVERNMENT SOUGHT SENTENCES OF 240 YEARS FOR TWO ETA TERRORISTS 
FOR AN ALLEGED 1987 ATTACK AGAINST A POLICE CONVOY.  HOWEVER, 
THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION LIMITS THE ACTUAL TIME SERVED TO A 
MAXIMUM OF 30 YEARS. 
 
- - - - - - - - - 
B. EXTRADITIONS 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
7.  ETA TERRORISTS RESIDE IN MANY FOREIGN NATIONS, INCLUDING 
CAPE VERDE, CUBA, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, ECUADOR, FRANCE, SAO 
TOME E PRINCIPE, AND VENEZUELA.  OFTEN, THEY RESIDE ABROAD IN 
AN EXILE STATUS UNDER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN SPAIN AND THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT. 
 
8.  DURING 1990, SPAIN VIGOROUSLY PURSUED EFFORTS TO EXTRADITE 
ETA TERRORISTS FROM ABROAD, ESPECIALLY FROM FRANCE.  IN MAY, 
FRANCE EXTRADITED JOSE RAMON MARTINEZ DE LA FUENTE (\"TZORI\") TO 
SPAIN; MARTINEZ HAD BEEN DETAINED IN FRANCE IN 1985.  WITH THIS 
EXCEPTION, NO IMPORTANT ETA MEMBER RESIDENT IN FRANCE HAS BEEN 
EXTRADITED TO SPAIN. 
 
9.  IN OCTOBER 1990, FRANCE TURNED DOWN THREE MAJOR SPANISH 
EXTRADITION REQUESTS FOR ETA TERRORISTS.  ONE INVOLVED JOSE 
ANTONIO URRUTICOETXEA BENGOETXEA (\"JOSU TERNERA\"), WHO WAS 
CONSIDERED A MAJOR ETA LEADER AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST IN 
1988.  FRANCE DENIED THE EXTRADITION ON THE GROUNDS THAT 
MEMBERSHIP IN AN ARMED BAND WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY 
EXTRADITION.  ANOTHER EXTRADITION REQUEST, THE SEVENTH ONE 
AGAINST SANTIAGO ARROSPIDE-SARASOLA (\"SANTI POTROS\"), WAS 
DENIED IN OCTOBER ON THE SAME GROUNDS, EVEN AS SPAIN FILED AN 
EIGHTH EXTRADITION REQUEST.  THIS MAN HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A 
POLITICAL REFUGEE BY FRANCE SINCE 1982.  IN A THIRD DECISION, 
THIS ONE INVOLVING JOSE LUIZ ARRIETA ZUBIMENDI (\"AIZCOITI\"), 
THE FRENCH COURT TERMED THE SPANISH EXTRADITION \"WEAK\" FOR 
FAILURE TO ALLEGE AND DOCUMENT SPECIFIC CRIMINAL CHARGES WITHIN 
THE REQUIRED TIME PERIOD, BUT LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SPAIN\'S STRENGTHENING THE REQUEST. 
 
10.  IN FALL 1990, SPAIN REQUESTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF SAO 
TOME E PRINCIPE WITHDRAW DIPLOMATIC STATUS FROM SPANISH 
NATIONAL FRANCISCO PAESA SANCHEZ, WHO WAS SUSPECTED OF BEING 
INVOLVED WITH THE GAL, IN ORDER THAT PAESA MIGHT BE EXTRADITED 
TO SPAIN.  PAESA SERVES AS REPRESENTATIVE OF SAO TOME E 
PRINCIPE TO U.N. AGENCIES IN GENEVA. 
 
11.  A MADRID COURT REPORTEDLY APPROVED IN SEPTEMBER 1989 A GOF 
REQUEST FOR THE EXTRADITION OF GEORGE MENDAILLE, ACCUSED OF 
RECRUITING GUNMEN INVOLVED IN GAL OPERATIONS IN FRANCE. 
SPANISH AUTHORITIES RELEASED MENDAILLE FROM PREVENTIVE 
DETENTION THIS SUMMER. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
C. IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
12.  THE PRINCIPAL IMPEDIMENT TO EXTRADITION FROM SPAIN IS THAT 
EXTRADITION WILL NOT BE GRANTED IF THE PERSON WOULD BE SUBJECT 
TO THE DEATH PENALTY.  THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN AVOIDED IN THE 
PAST BY AN UNDERTAKING BY THE REQUESTING COUNTRY THAT THE DEATH 
PENALTY WILL NOT BE SOUGHT IN THE CASE IN QUESTION. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
D. RESPONSES TO COMBAT TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
13.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT STRONGLY AND CONSISTENTLY OPPOSES 
TERRORISM.  TERRORIST ACTS ARE VEHEMENTLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY 
CONDEMNED BY HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ANY 
DOMESTIC INCIDENT. 
 
14.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SPAIN IS WAGING A STRONG CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST DOMESTIC SUPPORT OF TERRORISM.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN EARLY 
1990, THE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTED AN INTENSE DOMESTIC CAMPAIGN 
FOR CITIZEN ASSISTANCE IN APPREHENDING THE SIX GRAPO MEMBERS 
PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASED GRAPO TERRORIST 
ACTIVITY IN LATE 1989 AND EARLY 1990. 
 
15.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SPAIN HAS DISPERSED ETA PRISONERS 
THROUGHOUT THE SPANISH PRISON SYSTEM, IN AN EFFORT TO ISOLATE 
SUCH PRISONERS FROM EACH OTHER AND TO DENY THEM MUTUAL 
SUPPORT.  FOLLOWING AN UPSURGE IN GRAPO ATTACKS IN LATE 1989 
AND EARLY 1990, GRAPO PRISONERS WERE ALSO DISPERSED.   WHEN 
GRAPO PRISONERS PROTESTED THIS DISPERSION BY A PROLONGED HUNGER 
STRIKE, SOME WERE FORCE-FED TO PREVENT DEATH, AN ACTION LATER 
UPHELD BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AS JUSTIFIED.  SECURITY 
FORCES WERE PLACED ON HIGH ALERT AFTER ONE OF THE GRAPO HUNGER 
STRIKERS DIED, AND THEY HAVE REMAINED ON HIGH ALERT EVER SINCE. 
 
16.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO OFFERED A LIMITED IMMUNITY 
PROGRAM FOR TERRORIST PRISONERS WHO WILL RENOUNCE THE USE OF 
FORCE.  THIS \"REINSERTION PROGRAM\" IS DESIGNED NOT ONLY TO 
CONVINCE INDIVIDUAL TERRORISTS TO RENOUNCE TERRORISM AS A 
POLITICAL TOOL, BUT TO DIVIDE LOYALTIES WITHIN THE TERRORIST 
GROUPS.  CURRENTLY, 17 OF THE MORE THAN 450 ETA PRISONERS HAVE 
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS OFFER AND ARE BEING HELD UNDER LOW 
SECURITY CONDITIONS; IN 1989, ONLY 2 PRISONERS WERE HELD UNDER 
SUCH LOW SECURITY CONDITIONS. 
 
17.  SPAIN HAS ALSO SOUGHT TO IMPEDE FUND RAISING ACTIVITIES BY 
TERRORISTS, BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO COLLECT RANSOMS FROM 
THE FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES OF KIDNAP VICTIMS.  SPANISH LAW 
MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO \"COLLABORATE\" WITH TERRORISTS BY PAYING A 
RANSOM.  SEVERAL PERSONS WHO ACTED AS MIDDLEMEN IN THE PAYMENT 
OF RANSOM DEMANDS BY ETA WERE CHARGED WITH THIS OFFENSE IN 
MARCH 1990.  THEY WERE ALSO UNDER SUSPICION AS PRINCIPALS IN A 
SERIES OF KIDNAPPINGS BY ETA. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
E. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS OF 1990 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
18.  THE MAJOR FOCUS OF SPAIN\'S ANTI-TERRORISM ACTIVITIES HAS 
BEEN ETA AND GRAPO.  NONETHELESS, THE ARREST IN NOVEMBER 1989 
OF THE EIGHT HIZBALLAH TERRORISTS, TOGETHER WITH EXPLOSIVES, IN 
SPAIN BROUGHT AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE DANGER SUCH 
TRANSNATIONAL GROUPS MAY POSE WITHIN SPAIN.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
FOLLOWING THIS ARREST, SPAIN SPONSORED AN INTERNATIONAL 
CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS THE HIZBALLAH TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. 
SPAIN ALSO COORDINATES ITS COUNTERTERRORIST EFFORTS THROUGH ITS 
ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN THE EC\'S TREVI GROUP. 
 
19.  IN 1990, BILATERAL ANTI-TERRORISM COOPERATION IMPROVED 
MOST NOTABLY WITH FRANCE.  THE MOST TANGIBLE RESULT WAS THE 
ARREST IN FRANCE AND SPAIN OF THREE OF THE FIVE LEADERS OF 
ETA\'S ITINERANT COMMAND.  SPAIN ALSO CONSULTS REGULARLY ON A 
BILATERAL BASIS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THE UNITED 
STATES. 
 
20.  DOMESTICALLY, SPAIN HAS TRIED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF 
ITS POLICE OPERATIONS.  COOPERATION BETWEEN REGIONAL AND 
NATIONAL POLICE FORCES HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY TARGETED AND THE 
BASQUE REGIONAL POLICE PARTICIPATED IN SOME NATIONAL POLICE 
OPERATIONS IN 1990. 
 
21.  WHEN A HIGHER THREAT OF TERRORISM HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED, 
SPANISH AUTHORITIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A 
SUCCESSFUL TERRORIST OPERATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, SECURITY IN 
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS WAS IMPROVED IN MID-1990 FOLLOWING A RASH 
OF SUCCESSFUL LETTER AND PACKAGE BOMBS.  POLICE SECURITY IS 
MARKEDLY INCREASED FOR TOURIST SITES DURING THE SUMMER TOURIST 
SEASON; AND WHEN ETA THREATENED TO BOMB SPECIFIED RAILWAY LINES 
IN AUGUST, AS IT HAD DONE IN THE PAST, PASSENGER TRAFFIC WAS 
DIVERTED TO OTHER LINES WHENEVER POSSIBLE, IN ADDITION TO OTHER 
PRECAUTIONS.   MORE RECENTLY, SECURITY AROUND U.S. AND SEVERAL 
OTHER FOREIGN INSTALLATIONS WAS INCREASED BECAUSE OF A HIGHER 
THREAT LEVEL OF MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORISM ARISING FROM EVENTS IN 
THE GULF. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
F.  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
22.  THE GOS DOES NOT SUPPORT, FINANCIALLY OR DIPLOMATICALLY, 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THE PLO MAINTAINS A 
REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN MADRID, BUT THAT OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE 
DIPLOMATIC STATUS.  IN THE UNITED NATIONS, THE GOS HAS OPPOSED 
OBSERVER STATUS FOR THE PLO, AND THE GOS SUPPORTS EC SANCTIONS 
AGAINST LIBYA. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
G. PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUPPORTING TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
23.  THE GOS DOES NOT MAKE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON TERRORISM ISSUES. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
H. CHANGES IN SPANISH ATTITUDES TOWARDS TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
24.  DOMESTIC COUNTERTERRORISM, AIMED PRIMARILY AT ETA AND 
GRAPO, IS AN HIGH, PRIORITY EFFORT.  OTHER TERRORIST THREATS 
HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN VIEWED AS IMMEDIATE.  HOWEVER, THE 
ARREST OF HIZBALLAH MEMBERS AND SEIZURE OF EXPLOSIVES IN 
NOVEMBER 1989 RAISED THE THREAT OF MIDDLE EAST TERRORISM IN 
SPAIN. 
 
25.  WITH THE ADVENT OF THE 1992 OLYMPIC GAMES IN BARCELONA AND 
THE WORLD\'S FAIR IN SEVILLE, SPAIN IS INCREASINGLY AWARE AND 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISK OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IN CONNECTION 
WITH THOSE EVENTS.  IN THIS REGARD, ETA THREATENED IN 1990 TO 
DISRUPT THE WORLD\'S FAIR AND SENT A PACKAGE BOMB TO THE 
EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF THE WORLD\'S FAIR IN SEVILLE.

SUBJECT: SPAIN: 1991 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 346420 
 
1.  THE FOLLOWING REPORT IS EMBASSY\'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR SPAIN FOR 1991.  RESPONSES ARE 
KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS POSED IN REFTEL. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
A. GOS PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND 
SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
2. TERRORIST ATTACKS IN SPAIN INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN 1991, 
LEAVING MORE VICTIMS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN ALL 
OF 1990.  THE TWO MAJOR TERRORIST GROUPS ARE THE EXTREMIST 
BASQUE SEPARATIST GROUP \"EUSKADI TA ASKATASUNA\" (ETA), OR THE 
BASQUE HOMELAND AND LIBERTY MOVEMENT, AND THE SMALLER, RADICAL 
ANTI-CAPITALIST GROUP \"FIRST OF OCTOBER ANTI-FASCIST RESISTANCE 
GROUP\" (GRAPO).  ETA\'S PRINCIPAL INTERNATIONAL CONNECTION IS TO 
BASQUES RESIDENT IN FRANCE.  THE \"ITINERANT COMMAND\" WITHIN 
ETA, DISMANTLED IN 1990 THROUGH GOS/GOF COOPERATION, WAS 
COMPOSED OF FRENCH BASQUES OR SPANISH BASQUE RESIDENTS IN 
FRANCE.  ETA BRANCHED OUT IN 1991 FROM 1989-90 ATTACKS AGAINST 
SPANISH RELATED TARGETS IN THE NETHERLANDS TO TARGETS IN ITALY 
AND GERMANY.  WHEN THE ITALIAN TERRORIST GROUP \"FALANGE ARMADA\" 
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR 1991 BOMBINGS IN ROME AND MILAN, IT 
SAID THAT IT ACTED ON ETA\'S BEHALF.  GRAPO ALSO HAS CONTACTS 
WITH FRANCE, AND SOME OF ITS LEADERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE 
RESIDENT THERE. 
 
3. TWO SMALLER SPANISH TERRORIST GROUPS WERE ALSO ACTIVE IN 
1991:  THE BASQUE ANTI-CAPITALIST TERRORIST GROUP \"IRAULTZA,\" 
WHICH HAD BEEN DORMANT FOR SOME MONTHS (AND WHICH HAS TARGETED 
AMERICAN BUSINESSES IN THE PAST), AND THE GUERRILLA ARMY OF THE 
FREE GALICIAN PEOPLE (EGPGC).   A THIRD TERRORIST GROUP, \"TERRA 
LLIURE,\" A SMALL CATALAN SEPARATIST GROUP ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY 
WEAKENED, PUBLICLY RENOUNCED THE USE OF TERRORISM IN 1991 AND 
AFFILIATED ITSELF WITH A SMALL REGIONALIST PARTY.  IT MAY 
DEVELOP NON-VIOLENT PROTESTS DURING THE OLYMPIC GAME PERIOD. 
 
4. THE \"GAL\" (ANTI-TERRORIST LIBERATION GROUP) TRIAL OF TWO 
EX-NATIONAL POLICE OFFICIALS FOR ORGANIZING ASSASSINATIONS OF 
ETA MEMBERS IN FRANCE CONCLUDED THIS SUMMER, WITH BOTH MEN 
RECEIVING STIFF PRISON SENTENCES, EACH TOTALLING OVER 100 
YEARS. 
 
5. PRE-TRIAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE PROCEEDING AGAINST A NUMBER OF 
JAILED DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS; BUT THE CRIMINAL 
PROSECUTION PROCESS TENDS TO BE SLOW.  SPANISH LAW AUTHORIZES 
PREVENTIVE DETENTION OF ALLEGED TERRORISTS FOR UP TO TWO YEARS 
AND AN EXTENSION OF TWO YEARS UPON A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF 
PROBABLE CAUSE, WHILE INVESTIGATIONS ARE PROCEEDING.  THE GAL 
DEFENDANTS, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE UNDER DETENTION FOR THREE YEARS 
BEFORE THEIR TRIAL.  SPANISH PROSECUTORS ALSO ROUTINELY SEEK 
LENGTHY PRISON SENTENCES; BUT THE MAXIMUM TIME SERVED, EVEN IN 
CONVICTIONS FOR MULTIPLE CRIMES, CANNOT BE MORE THAN 30 YEARS. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
B. GOS EXTRADITIONS AND EXTRADITION REQUESTS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - 
 
6. ETA TERRORISTS RESIDE IN MANY COUNTRIES, AMONG THEM CAPE 
VERDE, CUBA, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, ECUADOR, FRANCE, SAO TOME 
E PRINCIPE, AND VENEZUELA.  OFTEN, THEY RESIDE ABROAD IN EXILE 
BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN SPAIN AND HOST GOVERNMENTS. 
 
7. DURING 1991, THE GOS CONTINUED ITS VIGOROUS EFFORTS TO 
EXTRADITE ETA TERRORISTS FROM ABROAD, ESPECIALLY FROM FRANCE, 
BUT WITH LITTLE SUCCESS.  PROCEDURAL EXTRADITION PROBLEMS 
BETWEEN THE GOF AND GOS CONTINUED TO HAMPER BILATERAL 
COOPERATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, A PROCEDURAL ERROR REQUIRED THE GOF 
TO RELEASE AN ETA OPERATIVE, ANTONIO GABIOLA GOYOGANA, IN 
JULY.  THE MAY 1990 EXTRADITION FROM FRANCE OF JOSE RAMON 
MARTINEZ DE LA PUENTE CONTINUES TO BE THE SOLE EXTRADITION FROM 
FRANCE OF A RELATIVELY HIGH RANKING ETA MEMBER. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
C. IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION 
- - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
8. THE PRINCIPAL IMPEDIMENT TO EXTRADITION FROM SPAIN IS THAT 
EXTRADITION WILL NOT BE GRANTED IF THE PERSON WOULD BE SUBJECT 
TO THE DEATH PENALTY.  THIS PROBLEM IS HANDLED BY AN 
UNDERTAKING FROM THE REQUESTING COUNTRY THAT THE DEATH PENALTY 
WILL NOT BE SOUGHT IN THE CASE IN QUESTION. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
D. OTHER RESPONSES TO COMBAT TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
9. THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT STRONGLY AND CONSISTENTLY OPPOSES 
TERRORISM, EVEN WHEN USED TO COMBAT TERRORISM, AS DEMONSTRATED 
BY THE GAL PROSECUTION.   TERRORIST ACTS ARE VEHEMENTLY, 
UNAMBIGUOUSLY, AND REPEATEDLY CONDEMNED BY HIGH RANKING GOS 
OFFICIALS. 
 
10. SPAIN IS NOT ONLY CONTINUING ITS STRONG CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM, BUT HAS STEPPED UP ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE 
COUNTER-TERRORISM READINESS.  THE GOS RECOGNIZES THAT THERE 
WILL BE AN INCREASED RISK OF TERRORISM IN 1992 DIRECTED AGAINST 
THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN BARCELONA AND ITS SATELLITE LOCATIONS, THE 
WORLD\'S FAIR IN SEVILLE, AND EVENTS CELEBRATING THE DISCOVERY 
OF THE AMERICAS. 
 
11. THE GOS IS CONTINUING ITS POLICY OF DISPERSING ETA AND 
GRAPO PRISONERS, TO ISOLATE THEM FROM SUPPORTERS AND MAKE 
RESCUE ATTEMPTS MORE DIFFICULT.   ETA AND GRAPO HAVE RESPONDED 
BY STEPPING UP ATTACKS AGAINST PRISON AUTHORITIES.  IN 1991, 
GRAPO ASSASSINATED A DOCTOR WHO TREATED GRAPO PRISONERS ON 
HUNGER STRIKE. 
 
12. THE GOS IS ALSO CONTINUING ITS REINSERTION PROGRAM, UNDER 
WHICH A PRISONER CONVICTED OF TERRORISM MAY RECEIVE LIMITED 
IMMUNITY IF HE RENOUNCES THE USE OF FORCE. 
 
13. THE GOS HAS MADE JUDICIAL REFORM ONE OF ITS PRIORITIES AND 
HAS INTRODUCED A BILL TO STRENGTHEN THE CRIMINAL CODE.  ONE NEW 
PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE ANYONE CONVICTED OF TERRORISM TO 
COMPLETE HIS/HER FULL SENTENCE, WITH NO TIME OFF FOR GOOD 
BEHAVIOR.  BECAUSE OF THE 30-YEAR LIMITATION ON PRISON 
SENTENCES SERVED, THE MAJOR IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE WOULD FALL ON 
THOSE RECEIVING SHORTER SENTENCES, SUCH AS MINOR ACCOMPLICES, 
DISCOURAGING ASSISTANCE TO TERRORISTS. 
 
14. SPANISH LAW PROHIBITS THE PAYMENT OF RANSOM TO TERRORISTS, 
CONSIDERING SUCH PAYMENT COLLABORATION.  ONE BUSINESSMAN 
KIDNAPPED IN LATE 1990 WAS RELEASED BY ETA IN FEBRUARY 1991, 
REPORTEDLY UPON PAYMENT OF A RANSOM BY HIS FAMILY, BUT NO 
PROSECUTIONS HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED, UNLIKE A SIMILAR CASE IN 
1990. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
E. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS OF 1991 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
15. SPAIN COORDINATES ITS COUNTERTERRORIST ACTIVITIES THROUGH 
THE EC\'S TREVI GROUP AND BILATERALLY WITH MANY NATIONS, 
INCLUDING THE U.S.  BILATERAL ANTI-TERRORISM COOPERATION WITH 
FRANCE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE AND HAS DELIVERED SOME IMPORTANT 
SUCCESSES AGAINST ETA IN FRANCE. 
 
16. DOMESTICALLY, GOS EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON ETA, AS THE MOST 
SOPHISTICATED AND LETHAL OF THE DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUPS, AND 
GRAPO.  AS IN 1990, COOPERATION BETWEEN THE NATIONAL POLICE AND 
CIVIL GUARD CONTINUES TO BE A GOS FOCUS FOR IMPROVEMENT.  ONE 
STEP IN THIS DIRECTION IN 1991 WAS TO RESTRUCTURE THE CIVIL 
GUARD TO MORE CLOSELY PARALLEL THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL 
POLICE. 
 
17. IN THE SUMMER OF 1991, ETA AGAIN ANNOUNCED A BOMBING 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST DESIGNATED RAIL LINES, IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
DISRUPT HOLIDAY TRAVEL EMBARRASS THE GOS.  THE GOS MOVED 
QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY TO AVOID PUBLIC PANIC AND LIMIT 
INCONVENIENCE, ALTHOUGH THIS REQUIRED A HEAVY COMMITMENT OF 
PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES.  THREE BOMBS EXPLODED ON RAILWAY 
LINES, WITH LIGHT MATERIAL AND NO HUMAN CASUALITIES. 
 
18. DURING THE GULF WAR, THE GOS TOOK IMMEDIATE STEPS TO 
INCREASE SECURITY AROUND HIGH RISK TARGETS AND DISCOURAGE ANY 
ATTEMPTED MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN SPAIN.  THE 
GOS ALSO TOOK SIMILAR SPECIAL MEASURES TO PROVIDE SECURITY 
DURING THE 1991 MIDDLE EAST PEACE CONFERENCE IN MADRID. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
F. GOS SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
19. THE GOS DOES NOT SUPPORT, FINANCIALLY OR DIPLOMATICALLY, 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THE PLO MAINTAINS A 
REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN MADRID, BUT THAT OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE 
DIPLOMATIC STATUS.  IN THE UNITED NATIONS, THE GOS HAS OPPOSED 
OBSERVER STATUS FOR THE PLO, AND THE GOS ENFORCES EC SANCTIONS 
AGAINST LIBYA. 
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
G. PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUPPORTING TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
20. THE GOES DOES NOT ISSUE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
TERRORISM OR OF TERRORIST SUPPORTING COUNTRIES ON TERRORISM 
ISSUES. 
 
- - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
H. CHANGES IN SPANISH ATTITUDES TOWARDS TERRORISM 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
21. THE AWARENESS OF THE THREAT POSED BY MIDDLE EASTERN 
TERRORISTS GREW IN 1991, AS SPAIN PARTICIPATED IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST IRAQI AGGRESSION AND HOSTED THE 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE CONFERENCE.

1.  THE TERRORIST SITUATION IN SPAIN IS NOT MARKEDLY 
DIFFERENT FROM THAT DESCRIBED IN \"PATTERNS OF GLOBAL 
TERRORISM - 1993\".  EMBASSY PROPOSES THE FOLLOWING FOR 
INCLUSION IN THE 1994 TERRORISM REPORT, REQUESTED REFTEL: 
 
2.  DURING 1994 SPANISH AND FRENCH AUTHORITIES ENJOYED 
CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS AGAINST THE BASQUE FATHERLAND AND 
LIBERTY (ETA) TERRORIST GROUP.  SEVERAL IMPORTANT ARRESTS 
WERE MADE, INCLUDING THAT OF THE SECOND IN COMMAND OF ETA\'S 
MILITARY WING.  SIGNIFICANT CACHES OF WEAPONS AND RECORDS 
IN FRANCE, INCLUDING A COMPUTER HARD-DISK OF BANK ACCOUNTS 
AND PHONE NUMBERS, WERE ALSO SEIZED.  NEVERTHELESS, ETA 
REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST THREAT IN SPAIN.  ON JULY 
29 THE THIRD RANKING OFFICIAL IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE, 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL FRANCISCO VEGUILLAS, WAS KILLED BY A CAR 
BOMB IN DOWNTOWN MADRID.  DESPITE ITS PROGRESS IN 
NEUTRALIZING ETA, THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR RECOGNIZES THAT 
A SIGNIFICANT COUNTERTERRORIST EFFORT MUST BE SUSTAINED. 
THE LEFTIST GRAPO TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY INSIGNIFICANT.  IN 1994 GRAPO\'S OPERATIONS 
WERE LIMITED TO OCCASIONAL ROBBERIES AND SMALL SCALE 
BOMBINGS.

TAGS:  PTER, SP 
SUBJECT:  SPAIN:  1997 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF.  STATE 203771 
 
1.  THE ONLY TERRORIST GROUP OPERATING IN SPAIN IS THE BASQUE 
TERRORIST GROUP ETA (FATHERLAND AND LIBERTY), WHICH CONTINUED 
IN 1997 ITS CAMPAIGN OF MURDER, BOMBINGS, KIDNAPPINGS, AND 
STREET VIOLENCE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAD SOME SUCCESS AGAINST ETA 
DURING THE YEAR, WITH KEY ARRESTS IN SPAIN AND FRANCE AND 
EXTRADITIONS OF ETA TERRORISTS FROM FRANCE AND LATIN AMERICA. 
MANY LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS CONTINUE TO HARBOR ETA 
TERRORISTS, HOWEVER, IN RESPONSE TO WHICH THE GOVERNMENT 
LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO CONVINCE LATIN AMERICAN AND OTHER 
GOVERNMENTS OF THE TRUE NATURE OF ETA.  THE MARXIST TERRORIST 
GROUP \"GRAPO\" WAS INACTIVE IN 1997 AND SOME OF ITS LEADERS 
WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON.  SPAIN SOUGHT WITH LIMITED SUCCESS 
AT THE JUNE EU SUMMIT IN AMSTERDAM TO SECURE AGREEMENT ON A 
PROTOCOL AIMED AT PREVENTING AN EU MEMBER STATE FROM GRANTING 
POLITICAL ASYLUM TO A NATIONAL OF ANOTHER EU MEMBER STATE. 
ALSO IN 1997 THE AUTHORITIES BROKE UP A RING OF THE ALGERIAN 
ISLAMIC TERRORIST GROUP GIA OPERATING IN SPAIN.  THERE WERE NO 
ACTS OF TERRORISM IN SPAIN IN 1997 AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. 
CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO PARAGRAPH 3 REFTEL. 
 
A)  ARRESTS AND PROSECUTIONS OF ETA TERRORISTS WERE ONGOING 
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  THERE ARE OVER 500 ETA TERRORISTS IN 
SPANISH JAILS AND THE NUMBER IS INCREASING.  FOR THE FIRST 
TIME, THE GOVERNMENT MOVED IN 1997 TO PROSECUTE ETA\'S 
POLITICAL WING, THE HERRI BATASUNA (HB) POLITICAL PARTY, WHICH 
HAS SEATS IN THE NATIONAL AND BASQUE REGIONAL PARLIAMENTS. 
ALL 23 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE (EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE) 
OF THIS LEGAL POLITICAL PARTY WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL IN OCTOBER 
ON CHARGES OF VIOLATING THE SPANISH LAW CRIMINALIZING 
COLLABORATION WITH AN ARMED BAND.  THE CHARGE STEMS FROM HB\'S 
DISSEMINATION DURING THE 1996 NATIONAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN OF A 
VIDEO CONTAINING FOOTAGE OF ETA TERRORISTS ADVOCATING 
VIOLENCE.  ON DECEMBER 1, SENTENCES OF SEVEN YEARS AND FINES 
OF ABOUT 3,500 DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THE 23 WERE ANNOUNCED. 
 
B)  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS ENERGETICALLY SOUGHT 
EXTRADITION FROM COUNTRIES IN WHICH ETA FUGITIVES RESIDE, AND 
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO FRANCE. 
FRENCH-SPANISH COOPERATION IN 1997 HAS LED TO KEY ARRESTS OF 
ETA LEADERS AND EXTRADITIONS FROM FRANCE TO SPAIN. JUST BEFORE 
THE FRENCH-SPANISH SUMMIT IN DECEMBER, THE FRENCH INTERIOR 
MINISTER ANNOUNCED THAT IN 1996, 144 PEOPLE DIRECTLY OR 
INDIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH ETA WERE ARRESTED ON FRENCH SOIL AND 
IN THE FIRST 10 MONTHS OF 1997 53 SUCH PERSONS WERE ARRESTED, 
23 OF THEM SPANISH BASQUES.  THE MINISTER ADDED THAT 62 ETA 
ACTIVISTS WERE TGRIED IN FRANCE IN 1997, AND THAT SINCE 
JANUARY 1, 1996, 23 SPANISH ETA TERRORISTS WERE EXTRADITED AND 
HANDED OVER TO SPANISH AUTHORITIES.  SPAIN HAS ALSO SOUGHT 
EXTRADITIONS FROM LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THE DOMINICAN 
REPUBLIC AND MEXICO EXTRADITED ETA TERRORISTS TO SPAIN IN 
1997.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO TERRORIST RELATED U.S. REQUESTS FOR 
EXTRADITION IN 1997. 
 
C)  THERE HAVE BEEN NO IMPEDIMENTS TO GOS PROSECUTION OR 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
D)  SPANISH GOVERNMENT LEADERS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT JOSE MARIA 
AZNAR AND INTERIOR MINISTER JAIME MAYOR OREJA, HAVE 
REPEATEDLY, FREQUENTLY, AND PUBLICLY DENOUNCED ETA TERRORISM. 
THEY SIMILARLY SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY AGAINST TERRORIST INCIDENTS 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ELSEWHERE.  FOLLOWING THE KIDNAPPING 
AND MURDER OF A TOWN COUNSELOR IN JULY, THE GOS PUT FORWARD 
LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAINST TERRORISM. 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT CHANGED ITS POLICY OF WILLINGNESS TO 
ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH ETA PROVIDED ETA FIRST RENOUNCES 
VIOLENCE. 
 
E)  THE DAILY REQUIREMENTS OF THE ONGOING STRUGGLE AGAINST ETA 
CONSUME A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF THE TIME AND RESOURCES OF THE 
GOS.  THAT ASIDE, THE FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONS IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL ARENA BY THE GOVERNMENT ARE NOTEWORTHY.  IN 
NOVEMBER 1996 SPAIN BECAME THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE EU TO 
RATIFY THE EUROPEAN EXTRADITION TREATY SIGNED ON SEPTEMBER 27, 
1996.  SPAIN SIGNED A NUMBER OF EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH 
LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THE GOS INTRODUCED MEASURES FOR 
CONSIDERATION BY THE EU\'S INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE THAT 
WOULD HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MEMBER STATE TO GRANT 
POLITICAL ASYLUM TO A NATIONAL OF ANOTHER MEMBER STATE, BUT 
DUE TO CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION FROM CERTAIN EU MEMBERS, A MUCH 
WATERED DOWN VERSION WAS EVENTUALLY APPROVED AT THE JUNE EU 
AMSTERDAM SUMMIT.  THE AGREED TEXT PRESERVES THE RIGHT TO 
GRANT ASYLUM TO A NATIONAL OF ANOTHER EU MEMBER STATE BUT 
MERELY REQUIRES THE ASYLUM GRANTING STATE TO INFORM THE 
EUROPEAN COUNCIL (THE REST OF THE EU MEMBER STATES) OF ITS 
ACTION.  SPANISH CONCERN ON THIS ISSUE IS MOTIVATED BY THE 
SEVERAL YEARS OLD REFUSAL OF BELGIUM TO EXTRADITE TWO ETA 
TERRORISTS TO SPAIN ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE REQUEST FOR 
POLITICAL ASYLUM OF THE TWO MUST BE RESOLVED IN THE BELGIAN 
COURT SYSTEM FIRST.  OTHER ACTIONS BY THE GOS DURING THE YEAR 
INCLUDED THE MAKING AND DISTRIBUTION OF A VIDEO PURPORTING TO 
TELL THE TRUE STORY OF ETA, INTENDED MAINLY FOR DISTRIBUTION 
IN LATIN AMERICA, WHERE SOME GOVERNMENTS AND PUBLIC OPINION IN 
SOME COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO VIEW ETA IN ROMANTIC, \"FREEDOM 
FIGHTER\" TERMS.  TO REINFORCE THE VIDEO, A BIPARTISAN 
DELEGATION OF THE SPANISH PARLIAMENT TRAVELLED TO SELECTED 
LATIN AMERICAN STATES TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE OF THE VIDEO. 
PRESIDENT AZNAR, ON A VISIT TO CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, 
ANNOUNCED THE SIGNING OF NEW EXTRADITION AGREEMENTS WITH 
VARIOUS STATES OF THE REGION, INCLUDING PANAMA. 
 
F)  THERE WAS NO SPANISH GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM IN 
1997. 
 
G)  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE 
IN 1997. 
 
H)  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE SINCE 1996 IN THE SPANISH 
GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR 
DOMESTIC. 
 
I)  UNDER THE NEW TRANSATLANTIC AGENDA, SIGNED IN MADRID IN 
DECEMBER 1995, THE U.S. AND THE EU, OF WHICH SPAIN IS A 
MEMBER, MAINTAIN ONGOING ANTI-TERRORIST COOPERATION ACROSS A 
BROAD FRONT.  THE FIRST BILATERAL COUNTERTERRORISM 
CONSULTATIONS WITH THE U.S. TOOK PLACE IN MAY, WHEN THE GOS 
HOSTED A DELEGATION LED BY THE DEPARTMENT COORDINATOR FOR 
SECURITY AND COUNTER TERRORISM.  THE GOS HAS REQUESTED THAT 
BILATERAL TERRORISM CONSULTATIONS WITH THE U.S. BE 
INSTITUTIONALIZED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. 
 
J)  GOS COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IS 
EXCELLENT.  AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS THE DECEMBER 4, 1996 
SPANISH EXTRADITION OF ACHILLE LAURO HIJACKER MAJID AL-MOLQI, 
TO ITALY.  GOS OFFICIALS WERE AWARE OF THE CONSIDERABLE U.S. 
INTEREST IN AL-MOLQI\'S EXTRADITION.  AL MOLQI HAD FAILED TO 
RETURN TO PRISON IN ROME IN FEBRUARY 1996 AT THE END OF A 12- 
DAY PAROLE.  HE WAS LATER PICKED UP IN SPAIN. 
 
K)  THE USG HAS NOT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS SOUGHT SPANISH 
COOPERATION IN THE PREVENTION OF ANY PARTICULAR ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.

REF:   A. STATE 202128 
--     B. 97 MADRID 11809 
 
1.  THE BASQUE TERRORIST GROUP ETA ANNOUNCED A UNILATERAL AND 
UNCONDITIONAL CEASE-FIRE ON SEPTEMBER 16.  THE CEASE-FIRE HAS 
HELD.  PRIOR TO THE CEASE-FIRE, ETA KILLED SIX PERSONS IN 
1998.  PRESIDENT AZNAR CALLED NOVEMBER 3 FOR DIRECT TALKS WITH 
ETA ON WAYS TO MAKE THE CEASE FIRE PERMANENT.  THOSE TALKS 
HAVE NOT OFFICIALLY BEGUN.  THE GOVERNMENT AND ETA APPEAR TO 
HAVE DIFFERING AGENDAS FOR SUCH TALKS, WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
OFFERING SOME MEASURES OF RELIEF FOR ETA\'S MORE THAN 500 
PRISONERS AND ESTIMATED 1,000 EXILEES WHILE ETA WANTS TO 
INCLUDE POLITICAL ISSUES OF SOVEREIGNTY AND SELF- 
DETERMINATION.  THE MARXIST TERRORIST GROUP GRAPO RE-EMERGED 
IN 1998 AFTER A THREE YEAR HIATUS.  THE GOVERNMENT DISCOUNTS 
THE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY OF GRAPO BUT THE ORGANIZATION 
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR A NUMBER OF BOMBINGS, AND SOME 
BUSINESSMEN HAVE RECEIVED EXTORTION LETTERS SIGNED BY GRAPO. 
SPAIN SIGNED THE ELEVENTH TERRORISM CONVENTION IN 1998.  THE 
GOS EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR U.S. ATTACKS ON BIN LADIN TERRORIST 
FACILITIES IN AFGHANISTAN AND SUDAN.  A YEAR-LONG EFFORT BY 
SPAIN TO EXTRADITE ACCUSED ETA TERRORIST RAMON ALDASORO FROM 
THE UNITED STATES SUFFERED A SETBACK WHEN A U.S. DISTRICT 
COURT JUDGE GRANTED A PETITION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS 
FILED BY ALDASORO\'S ATTORNEY\'S.  THERE WERE NO ACTS OF 
TERRORISM IN SPAIN IN 1998 AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS 
OR FACILITIES. 
 
2.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO PARAGRAPH 3 REFTEL. 
 
A)  ARRESTS AND PROSECUTIONS OF ETA TERRORISTS WERE ONGOING 
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  THERE ARE 530 ETA TERRORISTS IN JAIL AND 
ABOUT TWICE THAT MANY IN EXILE.  BELEN GONZALEZ PENALVA, AN 
ETA TERRORIST WHOSE EXTRADITION THE GOS HAD SOUGHT FROM THE 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC IN CONNECTION WITH A 1985 BOMBING IN WHICH 
AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WAS KILLED, LEFT THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC IN 
OCTOBER AND HER CURRENT WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN. 
 
B)  THE U.S. DID NOT REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS FROM SPAIN IN 1998.  A SPANISH REQUEST FOR 
EXTRADITION FROM THE U.S. OF ACCUSED ETA TERRORIST RAMON 
ALDASORO WAS STYMIED BY A WRIT OF HABEUS CORPUS ISSUED BY A 
U.S. FEDERAL JUDGE IN FLORIDA.  THE U.S. IS APPEALING THE 
WRIT.  SPAIN CONTINUED TO SEEK, WITH SOME SUCCESS, 
EXTRADITIONS FROM VARIOUS LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AND FRANCE 
OF ETA FUGITIVES. 
 
C)  THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
D)  THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO SPEAK OUT AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS CONDEMNING TERRORIST ACTS, INCLUDING THE BOMBINGS OF 
THE U.S. EMBASSIES IN KENYA AND TANZANIA.  A STATEMENT BY THE 
FOREIGN MINISTER SUPPORTED U.S. STRIKES AGAINST BIN LADIN 
FACILITIES IN SUDAN AND AFGHANISTAN. 
 
E)  THE GOVERNMENT\'S CHIEF COUNTERTERRORISM PREOCCUPATION 
CONTINUES TO BE ETA.  IN ADDITION TO ONGOING POLICE AND LAW 
ENFORCMENT ACTION TO BREAK UP ETA COMMANDOS AND ARREST THEIR 
MEMBERS, THE GOVERNMENT IN 1998 UNDERTOOK A SERIES OF MEASURES 
DESIGNED TO DEBILITATE ETA\'S FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE.  THESE 
MEASURES INCLUDED ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT ETA\'S FUND RAISING 
CAPABILITIES, SHUT DOWN BUSINESSES WITH ETA INVOLVEMENT, AND 
LOCATE ETA\'S FINANCIAL ASSETS.  IN JULY THE GOVERNMENT SHUT 
DOWN THE PRO-ETA NEWSPAPER \"EGIN.\" 
 
F)  THERE WAS NO SPANISH GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM IN 
1998. 
 
G)  THE GOVERNMENT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING STATE ON A TERRORISM ISSUE IN 1998. 
 
H)  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE SINCE 1997 IN THE SPANISH 
GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR 
DOMESTIC. 
 
I)  U.S.-SPANISH ANTI-TERRORIST COOPERATION OCCURS ACROSS A 
BROAD RANGE OF OPERATIONAL CONTACTS INVOLVING VARIOUS AGENCIES 
OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  COOPERATION ALSO OCCURS IN 
MULTILATERAL FORA AND BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE EU, OF WHICH 
SPAIN IS A MEMBER.  EARLIER THIS YEAR THE U.S., CITING LIMITED 
RESOURCES AND TIME CONSTRAINTS ON THE U.S. OFFICIALS WHO WOULD 
BE INVOLVED, DECLINED A SPANISH REQUEST TO INSTITUTIONALIZE 
BILATERAL COUNTERTERRORISM CONSULTATIONS, HELD FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN MAY 1997 IN MADRID. 
 
J)  NO ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS 
HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON SPANISH TERRITORY IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. 
IN 1996 THE GOS EXTRADITED ACHILLE LAURO HIJACKER MAJID AL- 
MOLQI TO ITALY, FROM WHERE HE HAD ESCAPED FROM PAROLE. 
 
K)  THE USG HAS NOT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS SOUGHT SPANISH 
COOPERATION IN THE PREVENTION OF ANY PARTICULAR ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.

ADVOCATES WITHIN THE EU FOR ENHANCING MECHANISMS TO FIGHT 
TERRORISM. 
 
THE FOLLOWING IS THE 2002 TERRORISM REPORT SUBMISSION FOR 
SPAIN. 
 
A. GOS SUPPORT FOR GLOBAL ANTI/TERRORISM COALITION 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
1. ACTIONS AGAINST AL QAEDA OPERATIVES 
 
BUILDING ON ARRESTS MADE IN 2001, SPANISH LAW ENFORCEMENT 
MADE ADDITIONAL ARRESTS OF AL QAEDA ASSOCIATES DURING 2002. 
IN JANUARY, POLICE ARRESTED MOROCCAN CITIZEN NAJIB CHAIB 
MOHAMED IN A BARCELONA SUBURB.  CHAIB MOHAMED WAS ACCUSED OF 
BELONGING TO A TERRORIST CELL HEADED BY IMAD EDDIN BARAKAT 
YARKAS, ALSO KNOWN AS ABU DAHDAH, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN SPAIN 
IN NOVEMBER 2001.  SPANISH POLICE BELIEVE DAHDAH/YARKAS WAS 
AL QAEDA\'S LEADING OPERATIVE AND RECRUITER IN SPAIN.  HE 
REMAINS IN CUSTODY.  CHAIB MOHAMED WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH 
FALSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS AND CREDIT CARD FRAUD. 
 
ON APRIL 13, THE SPANISH CIVIL GUARD ARRESTED AHMED BRAHIM, 
AN ALGERIAN NATIONAL WITH SPANISH RESIDENCY, AND CHARGED HIM 
WITH \"COLLABORATION WITH AN ARMED GROUP.\"  FOUR OTHER 
INDIVIDUALS HOLDING FRENCH PASSPORTS WERE WITH BRAHIM AT THE 
TIME AND WERE DETAINED BUT LATER RELEASED.  THE ARREST WAS 
PRECIPITATED BY THE SALE OF PROPERTY AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT 
APPEARED TO BE PREPARATIONS ON THE PART OF BRAHIM TO LEAVE 
SPAIN.  THE SPANISH CIVIL GUARD ACCUSED BRAHIM OF FINANCING 
SOME TERRORIST \"SLEEPER\" CELLS, OF ORGANIZING AL QAEDA\'S 
INVESTMENTS IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND OF SHELTERING 
ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.  BRAHIM REMAINS IN CUSTODY. 
 
ON APRIL 23, POLICE ARRESTED MOHAMMED GALEB KALAJE ZOUAYDI, 
ALIAS ABU THALHA, A NATURALIZED SPANISH CITIZEN OF SYRIAN 
DESCENT.  ZOUAYDI HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ARRESTED IN NOVEMBER 
2001, ALONG WITH ABU DAHDAH (YARKAS), AND HAD BEEN SET FREE 
SHORTLY THEREAFTER FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE.  AN ANALYSIS OF 
DOCUMENTS SEIZED PURSUANT TO SEARCH WARRANTS EXECUTED AT 
BOTH HIS RESIDENCE AND AT HIS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY DURING 
THE 2001 ARREST PROMPTED HIS RE-ARREST AND SUPPORTED THE 
CHARGE THAT ZOUAYDI IS A PRINCIPAL FINANCIER FOR THE AL 
QAEDA NETWORK. 
 
ON JULY 7, 2002, THE SPANISH NATIONAL POLICE ARRESTED FOUR 
SYRIAN-BORN MALES (SPANISH RESIDENTS) WITH TIES TO THE AL 
QAEDA ORGANIZATION.  THIS OPERATION WAS DIRECTED BY SPANISH 
NATIONAL COURT JUDGE BALTASAR GARZON AND WAS A CONTINUATION 
OF THE OPERATION (\"OPERATION DATIL\") TO DISMANTLE THE AL 
QAEDA TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN SPAIN.  ONE OF THE 
DETAINEES, GHASOUB AL-ABRASH, BELONGED TO A RADICAL 
ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  AL-ABRASH 
(GHASOUB) HAD BEEN DETAINED EARLIER IN 2002 AS PART OF 
\"OPERATION DATIL\" BUT HAD BEEN RELEASED.  DURING THIS 
INITIAL ARREST, POLICE SEIZED SEVERAL VIDEOTAPES FROM HIM. 
IT WAS LATER REVEALED THAT DURING A TRIP AL ABRASH (GHASOUB) 
MADE TO THE U.S. IN 1997, HE MADE VIDEO RECORDINGS OF 
INSTALLATIONS, CONSTRUCTION SITES AND US LANDMARKS.  THE 
LANDMARKS INCLUDED THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.  THE STYLE AND 
DURATION OF THE TAPES INDICATED THEY WERE NOT RECORDED FOR 
TOURIST PURPOSES. 
 
IN SEPTEMBER 2002, JUDGE GARZON ORDERED THE RELEASE ON BAIL 
OF THE FOUR SYRIAN-BORN SUSPECTS.  BAIL RANGED FROM $60,000 
TO $150,000.  GARZON SAID HE HAD TO DO THIS BECAUSE HE 
LACKED EVIDENCE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE HIGH SPANISH LEGAL 
STANDARD FOR HOLDING INDIVIDUALS IN CUSTODY PENDING TRIAL. 
GARZON SAID HE BELIEVED THE SUSPECTS HAD LINKS TO TERRORIST 
CELLS AND PLEDGED THAT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR 
ACTIVITIES WOULD CONTINUE. 
 
2. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS 
 
SPAIN HAS SUPPORTED THE RECONSTRUCTION OF AFGHANISTAN WITH 
HUMANITARIAN AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.  THROUGH THE THIRD 
QUARTER OF 2002, SPAIN HAD PROVIDED OVER USD 60 MILLION IN 
ASSISTANCE FOR AGRICULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, HUMANITARIAN, 
TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND OTHER PROGRAMS.  IN ADDITION, 
THE SPANISH COUNCIL OF MINISTERS APPROVED IN NOVEMBER A NON- 
REIMBURSABLE CREDIT LINE OF USD 12 MILLION TO AFGHANISTAN 
FOR RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS.   SPAIN HAS PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT 
MATERIAL SUPPORT TO OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (SEE SECTION 
F.) 
 
3. BLOCKING OF TERRORIST ASSETS 
 
SPAIN HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U.S. IN BLOCKING TERRORIST- 
FINANCED ASSETS, AND THE GOS IS SEEKING GREATER AUTHORITY TO 
IMPROVE THAT COOPERATION.  THE GOVERNMENT SENT DRAFT 
LEGISLATION TO THE SPANISH PARLIAMENT IN MARCH 2002 THAT 
WOULD FACILITATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE FREEZING OF BANK 
ACCOUNTS OF TERRORIST GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS.  PASSAGE IS 
EXPECTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003.  SPAIN ALSO CHAIRS 
WITH THE U.S. THE FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE (FATF) WORKING 
GROUP ON TERRORISM FINANCE. 
 
DURING 2002, THE EU INCLUDED THE NAMES OF 28 ETA MEMBERS 
SUBMITTED BY SPAIN TO ITS LISTS OF PERSONS/ORGANIZATIONS 
AGAINST WHOM MEASURES TO COMBAT TERRORISM FINANCING ARE TO 
BE TAKEN.  SPANISH LEADERS HAVE SAID THEY WOULD LIKELY MAKE 
A REQUEST TO INCLUDE THE POLITICAL PARTY BATASUNA AND ITS 
LEADERS (ETA\'S POLITICAL WING) IN SUCH A LIST IF SPANISH 
COURTS DECLARE BATASUNA ILLEGAL.  IN THIS EVENT (WHICH COULD 
HAPPEN IN 2003), SPAIN WOULD ALSO LIKELY APPROACH THE US FOR 
SIMILAR LISTINGS. 
 
4. COUNTER-TERRORISM LAWS 
 
A NEW LAW REFORMING THE SPANISH NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER 
WENT INTO EFFECT IN MAY.  ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE LAW IS TO 
PROMOTE COOPERATION BETWEEN SPANISH INTELLIGENCE SERVICES 
AND THOSE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  KEEPING TRACK OF ISLAMIST 
EXTREMIST CELLS IN SPAIN IS A HIGH PRIORITY OF THE SPANISH 
POLICE AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. 
 
A NEW \"LAW OF POLITICAL PARTIES\" WENT INTO EFFECT IN JUNE. 
THE LAW ESTABLISHES A JUDICIAL PROCESS TO DE-LEGALIZE 
POLITICAL PARTIES THAT PROVIDE CONCRETE SUPPORT TO TERRORIST 
GROUPS. 
 
IN OCTOBER, THE GOVERNING POPULAR PARTY AND THE MAIN 
OPPOSITION SOCIALIST PARTY AGREED TO SUPPORT JOINTLY A DRAFT 
LAW TO INCREASE SECURITY FOR POLITICIANS IN THE BASQUE 
REGION WHO ARE THREATENED WITH ASSASSINATION.  THE LAW WOULD 
INCREASE FUNDING TO PROVIDE MORE BODYGUARDS AND OTHER 
PROTECTION FOR LOCAL POLITICIANS.  THE DRAFT LAW IS ON A 
FAST TRACK; THE PARLIAMENT MAY PASS IT IN LATE DECEMBER 
2002. 
 
5.  IN MAY, SPAIN RATIFIED THE UN CONVENTION ON SUPPRESSION 
OF TERRORIST FINANCING.  SPAIN HAS NOW RATIFIED ALL 12 OF 
THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON TERRORISM. 
 
B. RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
----------------------------------- 
 
1. ON AUGUST 26, JUDGE GARZON ISSUED AN ORDER CALLING FOR 
THE IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION OF BATASUNA\'S (ETA POLITICAL WING) 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACTIVITIES FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS.  THE 
SUSPENSION COULD BE EXTENDED TO A TOTAL OF FIVE YEARS.  THE 
ORDER INCLUDED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CLOSING OF ALL 
BATASUNA OFFICES AND THE FREEZING OF ANY BATASUNA FINANCIAL 
ASSETS.  LOCAL, REGIONAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS (AS WELL AS 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT) ARE PROHIBITED FROM SUBSIDIZING 
BATASUNA.  THE ORDER ALSO PROHIBITS ANY PRIVATE DONATIONS TO 
BATASUNA. 
 
2. AS OF NOVEMBER, SPANISH POLICE HAD ARRESTED 120 PERSONS 
FOR ASSOCIATION WITH OR MEMBERSHIP IN ETA, AND DISMANTLED 13 
ETA \"CELLS.\" 
 
3. ON NOVEMBER 21, JUDGE GARZON ISSUED AN ORDER ACCUSING 22 
BATASUNA MEMBERS OF BELONGING TO ETA.  THIS ORDER EXPANDED 
ON THE ONE GARZON ISSUED AUGUST 26 (FIRST PARAGRAPH IN THIS 
SECTION).  OUT OF THE 22 BATASUNA LEADERS, SIX ARE MEMBERS 
OF THE BASQUE REGIONAL PARLIAMENT. 
 
4. IN OCTOBER, THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ASKED THE 
NATIONAL COURT TO ISSUE AN ORDER SUSPENDING THE ACTIVITIES 
OF THE RECONSTRUCTED COMMUNIST PARTY OF SPAIN, WHICH IS 
CONSIDERED TO BE THE POLITICAL ARM OF THE TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION GRAPO.  IN ADDITION TO THIS, DURING 2002, 
TWENTY-TWO MEMBERS OF GRAPO WERE ARRESTED, EIGHT OF THEM IN 
PARIS AND THE REST IN SPAIN (VITORIA, MADRID AND 
VALLADOLID).   AS OF NOVEMBER, GRAPO HAD NOT CONDUCTED ANY 
TERRORIST ACTS IN SPAIN IN 2002. 
 
C. EXTRADITION OF TERRORISTS 
---------------------------- 
 
SINCE THE SIGNING IN OCTOBER 2001 OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN FOR TEMPORARY DELIVERY OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS IMPRISONED IN FRANCE TO STAND TRIAL IN SPAIN, 
FRANCE HAS TRANSFERRED PRISONERS UNDER THE AGREEMENT THREE 
TIMES.  IN ADDITION TO THESE TEMPORARY DELIVERIES, FRANCE 
HAS EXTRADITED TO SPAIN FOUR ETA MEMBERS AND HAS EXPELLED 
ONE. 
 
SPAIN HAS BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT WITHIN THE EU OF THE 
EUROPEAN WIDE ARREST AND DETENTION ORDER (THE \"EURO-ORDER\"), 
WHICH IT HOPES TO APPLY TO TERRORISTS ONCE THE MEASURE GOES 
INTO FORCE IN THE EU. (SEE SECTION F). 
 
D. IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION 
----------------------------- 
 
SPAIN HAS ALSO BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT WITHIN THE EU OF AN 
EU-WIDE EXTRADITION AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S.  HOWEVER, SPAIN 
SUPPORTS THE EU CONSENSUS OF OPPOSING EXTRADITION TO THE 
U.S. IF A PRISONER WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE DEATH PENALTY.  A 
U.S. REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS TO 
MILITARY TRIBUNALS WOULD ALSO POSE PROBLEMS FOR THE SPANISH 
JUDICIARY.  IN PRACTICE, EXTRADITION TO THE US IS POSSIBLE 
ONCE SPANISH JUDICIAL CONCERNS REGARDING APPLICATION OF THE 
DEATH PENALTY ARE RESOLVED (SPAIN WOULD INSIST ON ADVANCE 
AGREEMENT THAT THE DEATH PENALTY NOT BE APPLIED TO PERSONS 
EXTRADITED TO THE U.S.) 
 
E. OTHER HOST RESPONSES 
----------------------- 
 
SPANISH GOVERNMENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON THE WAR ON TERRORISM 
HAVE BEEN VOCAL AND STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE, NOT ONLY IN THE 
WAKE OF 9-11 AND AFGHANISTAN, BUT DURING SUBSEQUENT 
TERRORIST ATTACKS (I.E. BALI, MOSCOW, KENYA). 
 
F. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 2002 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
ON OCTOBER 25, THE GOS SENT TO PARLIAMENT FOR RATIFICATION 
THE DRAFT LAW OF THE EUROPEAN WARRANT OF ARREST (EURO- 
ORDER).  SPAIN IS ONE OF SEVEN EU COUNTRIES TO HAVE MADE A 
COMMITMENT TO START APPLYING THE LAW ONE YEAR EARLY, DURING 
THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, INSTEAD OF JANUARY 2004. 
 
IN MARCH, THE SPANISH COUNCIL OF MINISTERS APPROVED THE 
SIGNING OF THE \"EUROJUST\" AGREEMENT ON JUDICIAL COOPERATION 
AMONG EU COUNTRIES.  IN JUNE, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS 
APPOINTED THE TWO MEMBERS WHO WILL REPRESENT SPAIN IN 
EUROJUST. 
 
IN MAY, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS APPROVED A DRAFT LAW THAT 
CALLED FOR CREATION OF JOINT INVESTIGATION TEAMS TO CARRY 
OUT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS IN ANY OR ALL OF THE MEMBER 
STATES.  THE DRAFT LAW WAS APPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
FRAMEWORK DECISION APPROVED BY THE COUNCIL OF EU JUSTICE AND 
HOME AFFAIRS MINISTERS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2001. 
 
ON OCTOBER 16, SPANISH MINISTER OF INTERIOR ANGEL ACEBES 
ANNOUNCED THAT SPAIN, ALONG WITH GREECE, ITALY AND THE UK, 
WOULD START A JOINT BORDER CONTROL AND SEAPORT CONTROL 
OPERATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TO FIGHT TERRORISM AND 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.   THE FIRST OPERATION IS SUPPOSED TO 
TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE END OF 2002. 
 
WITH RESPECT TO THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN, FROM THE BEGINNING, 
SPAIN HAS PROVIDED LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
COALITION AUTHORIZING THE USE OF SPANISH MILITARY BASES AT 
ROTA AND MORON.  WITHIN OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, SPAIN 
HAS PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL HUMANITARIAN TRANSPORT MISSIONS; 
IT CONTRIBUTED THREE C-130 HERCULES AND 70 SOLDIERS TO THE 
AIRBORNE DETACHMENT GEMINIS.  THIS IS IN ADDITION TO SPAIN 
HAVING AUTHORIZED THE PARTICIPATION OF SIX HELICOPTERS AND 
ABOUT 150 SOLDIERS IN OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COALITION.  FROM JANUARY TO OCTOBER 2002, A 
SPANISH MEDICAL DETACHMENT WAS PRESENT IN THE BAGRAM AIR 
BASE (NEAR KABUL).  SPAIN IS HEADING A NAVAL TASK FORCE IN 
THE HORN OF AFRICA TO DETECT AND DETER TERRORIST MOVEMENTS 
IN THAT AREA.  SPAIN HAS ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE ACTIVE 
ENDEAVOR AND COHERENT BEHAVIOR OPERATIONS, AND FOUR SPANISH 
MILITARY ARE IN THE U.S. AS PART OF THE NATO\'S AWACS STAFF. 
SPAIN\'S CURRENT CONTRIBUTION TO THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY 
ASSISTANCE FORCE (ISAF) IS ABOUT 300 SOLDIERS. 
 
G. AND H. NONE 
 
I. CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------- 
 
SPAIN HAS SUFFERED FROM ETA AND OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS FOR 
OVER 30 YEARS.  SPAIN WELCOMES THE INCREASED INTERNATIONAL 
COOPERATION IN COMBATING TERRORISM THAT HAS EMERGED SINCE 9- 
11.  SPAIN BELIEVES THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM HAS 
TRANSLATED INTO INCREASED POLICE, JUDICIAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
POLITICAL PRESSURE ON ETA THAT IS TAKING A DEFINITE TOLL ON 
ETA\'S OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS.  ETA ATTACKS AND KILLINGS 
ARE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY THUS FAR IN 2002. 
 
J. U.S. COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS WITH THE HOST GOVERNMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ASHCROFT MET SEPTEMBER 14 WITH THE SPANISH 
INTERIOR AND JUSTICE MINISTERS IN COPENHAGEN.  THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL REITERATED THE U.S. COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT SPAIN IN 
ITS FIGHT AGAINST ETA TERRORISM. 
 
IN FEBRUARY, THE UNITED STATES BLOCKED THE ASSETS OF 21 
PERSONS LINKED TO ETA.  IN JUNE, THE U.S. BLOCKED THE ASSETS 
OF SEVEN MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH TIES TO ETA AND THE ETA- 
LINKED ORGANIZATION, ASKATASUNA.  ANOTHER FOUR PERSONS 
LINKED TO ETA WERE INCLUDED ON THE U.S. TERRORIST LIST IN 
NOVEMBER. 
 
THE SPANISH SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SECURITY MET IN FEBRUARY 
WITH SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS.  DURING THAT MEETING HE PUBLICLY 
RESTATED SPAIN\'S INTENTION TO HELP THE U.S. IN ITS FIGHT 
AGAINST ISLAMIST EXTREMIST TERRORISM. 
 
DURING 2002, DOJ AND FBI EXPERTS WORKED WITH THE SPANISH 
NATIONAL COURT TO ASSIST IN THE ANALYSIS OF DOCUMENTS 
UNCOVERED IN INVESTIGATIONS OF AL QAEDA SUSPECTS OPERATING 
IN SPAIN.

TAGS: PTER, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN: 2003 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
Spain\'s counterterrorism efforts focused both on combating 
ETA terrorism and in taking action against suspected al 
Qaeda operatives in Spain.   ETA activity dropped 
significantly in 2003 due to tougher laws, increased police 
and judicial pressure, and effective international 
cooperation, particularly with France.  Spanish police and 
Spain\'s independent judiciary continued to take action 
against al Qaeda operatives in Spain during 2003.  In 
September 2003, Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted Osama 
Bin Laden and 34 other al Qaeda members or suspects (ten of 
whom are in Spanish custody).   In January 2003, Spanish 
police arrested 16 North Africans suspected of links to the 
al Qaeda network.  Judge Ruiz Polanco later released them 
for insufficient evidence, although the investigation 
remains open.  Spain has been a strong proponent of 
international counterterrorism cooperation, both within the 
EU and as Chairman of the UN Counterterrorism Committee. 
Spain passed a new terrorist finance law in 2003. 
 
Following is the 2003 terrorism report submission for Spain. 
 
A. GOS SUPPORT FOR GLOBAL ANTI-TERRORISM COALITION 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
1. Actions against Al Qaeda Operatives 
 
Building on arrests made in 2001 and 2002, Spanish police 
made additional arrests of Al Qaeda suspects during 2003. 
 
In January, police arrested 16 North African (mostly 
Algerian) nationals in Catalunya suspected of having ties 
with al Qaeda operatives in the UK and France.  In the 
course of the arrests, Spanish police seized manuals on 
chemical war, chemical products, and fraudulent IDs and 
passports.  Judge Ruiz Polanco provisionally closed the case 
on June 24 after a Spanish lab report on the chemical 
evidence proved inconclusive.   However, Ruiz Polanco 
reopened the case in September after receiving a lab report 
from the FBI.  The FBI report maintained that substances 
confiscated with the suspects, when mixed with other 
components, could result in homemade napalm.  Out of the 
sixteen suspects, the Judge re-interrogated four (Mohamed 
Nebbar, Mohamed Taharaoui, Djamel Boudjeltia, and Ali 
Kaouka) on September 30, and later re-released them, but 
this time on bail.  The case remains open. 
 
On March 7, Spanish national police in Valencia arrested 
four Spaniards and one Pakistani.  They were accused of 
belonging to a financial network involved in laundering 
money that was then sent to al Qaeda operatives.  The 
Spanish Ministry of Interior also linked these suspects to a 
terrorist attack that took place in April 2002 in Yerba, 
Tunisia, in which 19 people were killed.  On March 12, 2003 
Judge Isabel Moreno ordered two of these suspects (Spaniard 
Enrique Cerda and Pakistani Ahmed Ruksar) remanded to prison 
pending further investigation of the case.  The other three 
suspects were released. 
 
On August 6, Algerian national Diaouad Albdelhai was 
arrested in Lloret de Mar, Catalunya.  Germany had sought 
his arrest for association with Abdelrazak Mahdjoub, who was 
arrested in Hamburg the week before (Mahdjoub reportedly 
confessed he was planning terrorist attacks in Costa del 
Sol, Spain).  Germany requested Albdelhai\'s extradition on 
September 4; the request is still pending. 
 
On September 5, police arrested Taysir Alony, a Syrian-born 
Spanish national and journalist with the Al Yazira TV 
network.  Judge Garzon accused Alony of being part of an al 
Qaeda cell that was arrested (on Garzon\'s order) in November 
2001.   The leader of the cell is Syrian-born Spanish 
national Eddin Barakat Yarkas.   Alony was also accused of 
passing funds on behalf of al Qaeda during his travels to 
Afghanistan.  On September 11, Judge Garzon remanded Alony 
to jail without bail.   However, in October, another Spanish 
judge set Alony free on 6,000 euros bail, citing health 
reasons. 
 
On September 18, Spanish police arrested in Alicante, 
Granada and Madrid the following people: Moroccan citizen, 
Saddik Merizak, as well as Syrian citizens Hassan Alhusein; 
Jamal Hussein Hussein; Waheed Kalami; and Ahmad Koshagi 
Kalami.  All of them were accused by Judge Garzon of giving 
logistical and propaganda support to al Qaeda and of having 
ties with Eddin Barakat Yarkas and his al Qaeda cell.  They 
were sent to prison on September 21, except for Jamal 
Hussein who was released on 60,000 euros bail. 
 
2. Blocking of terrorist assets 
 
Spain has cooperated with the U.S. in blocking terrorist 
assets.  The Spanish Parliament passed new legislation in 
May 2003 to improve the blocking of terrorist financing. 
 
The new law permits the blocking of suspected terrorist 
accounts by Spanish executive branch action and creates an 
inter-ministerial commission on terrorism finance.  Prior to 
the passage of this law, Spanish authorities had to obtain a 
court order before they could freeze accounts.  The 
Parliament also passed new legislation in July to stiffen 
penalties for money laundering, which will also impede 
terrorist financing. 
 
In May 2003, the United States included Batasuna, the 
political wing of the terrorist organization ETA, on its 
terrorist finance list.  In June 2003, the EU also included 
Batasuna in its lists of terrorist organizations. 
 
Spain supports the creation of a UN list of terrorist 
organizations.  In September 2003, President Aznar advocated 
for a UN list in a speech to the Counterterrorism Committee, 
which Spain chairs in 2003-04. 
 
Spain co-chairs the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 
Terrorist Finance working group along with the United 
States.   In this role, Spain has been instrumental in 
developing best practices on charities and other areas of 
concern.  Spain also provides significant counterterrorism 
assistance to Latin American countries. 
 
4. Counter-Terrorism Laws 
 
In February 2003, the Spanish Parliament approved a law to 
increase security for politicians in the Basque region who 
are threatened with ETA assassination.  The law increases 
funding to provide more bodyguards and other protection for 
local politicians.  Spanish courts in the Basque region also 
enforced laws passed in 2002 that increase prison terms and 
provided for damages against those convicted terrorist 
related street crimes.  The new laws treat ETA-inspired 
vandalism as terrorist acts and impose fines on parents for 
pro-ETA destruction caused by their minor children.  Pro-ETA 
vandalism in the Basque region, such as the burning of buses 
or cash machines, dropped by over half in 2003 as a result 
of these measures. 
 
B. RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
----------------------------------- 
 
1. On September 17, Judge Garzon issued a 700-page 
provisional indictment against Osama Bin Laden and 34 other 
al Qaeda members.  The indictment included Imad Eddin 
Barakat Yarkas and ten other members (or suspected members) 
of his Spain-based al Qaeda cell.   The Barakat Yarkas cell 
members are all in Spanish custody.  The indictment outlined 
their support for al Qaeda and alleged links to 9-11 
conspirators. 
 
(Garzon\'s order confirmed that the following persons, 
suspected of membership in an al Qaeda cell, would remain in 
Spanish custody without bail: Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas; 
Mohamed Ghaleb Kalaje Zouadi; Mohamed Needl Acaid; Mohamed 
Zaher Asade; Jasem Mahboule; Osama Darra; Luis Jose Galan 
(aka Yusuf Galan); Taysir Alony (aka Abu Musab); Said 
Chedadi; Najib Chaib Mohamed; and Driss Chebli.  Al Jezira 
journalist Alony was subsequently released on bail on health 
grounds by another judge, but the investigation into his 
case remains active.) 
 
2. On March 17, the 16 member Spanish Supreme Court ruled 
unanimously to de-legalize Batasuna, Herri Batasuna, and 
Euskal Herritarrok, which constituted the political arm of 
the ETA terrorist organization.   The de-legalization 
included seizure of all assets of these groups and denied 
them any public subsidy, as had been the case while Batasuna 
was a legal political party. 
 
3. As of December, Spanish police had arrested over 120 
persons in 2003 for association with or membership in ETA, 
and dismantled nine ETA operational terrorist cells.  The 
Spanish strategy has also emphasized actions against ETA\'s 
support structure.  Numbers of arrests of members of ETA\'s 
recruitment and support structures include: 15 people in 
February; nine in April; 29 in October; and 12 in November. 
In 2003 there were about 500 ETA members in jail in Spain 
and over a hundred in France.  In early December 2003, 
French police arrested top leaders of ETA\'s military wing 
including Gorka Palacios and Idon Fernandez Iradi (aka 
Susper), dealing another severe blow to ETA.   Fernandez was 
reportedly preparing attacks in Spain to coincide with the 
2003 Christmas season. 
 
4. In March 2003, Judge Garzon issued an order suspending 
the activities of the Reconstructed Communist Party of 
Spain, the political arm of the terrorist organization 
GRAPO.  As of December 2003, and thanks to relentless police 
and judicial pressure in coordination with France, GRAPO had 
conducted no terrorist acts in Spain in 2002 or 2003. 
 
C. EXTRADITION OF TERRORISTS 
---------------------------- 
 
Under the 2001 bilateral agreement between France and Spain 
for temporary delivery of suspected terrorists imprisoned in 
France to stand trial in Spain, France has transferred 
prisoners under the agreement four times as of December 
2003.  In addition to these temporary deliveries, France has 
extradited to Spain six ETA members and has expelled three 
others. 
 
Spain has been a strong proponent within the EU of the 
European wide arrest and detention order (the \"euro-order\"), 
which it plans to apply to terrorists and organized crime 
once the measure goes into force in the EU in 2004. 
 
D. IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION 
----------------------------- 
 
Spain has also been a strong proponent within the EU of an 
EU-wide extradition agreement with the U.S.  However, Spain 
supports the EU consensus of opposing extradition to the 
U.S. if a prisoner will be subject to the death penalty. 
In practice, extradition to the US is possible once Spanish 
judicial concerns regarding application of the death penalty 
are resolved (Spain would insist on advance agreement that 
the death penalty not be applied to persons extradited to 
the U.S.). 
 
E. OTHER HOST RESPONSES 
----------------------- 
 
Spanish government public statements on the War on Terrorism 
have been vocal and strongly supportive, not only in the 
wake of 9-11 and Afghanistan, but also regarding coalition 
military action in Iraq, which was unpopular with the 
Spanish public. 
 
F. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 2003 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
1. Spain took over chairmanship of the UN Counterterrorism 
Committee. 
 
2. Spain co-chairs the Financial Action Task Force terrorist 
finance working group. 
 
3. On January 8, Spain and the U.S. signed an agreement 
under the Container Security Initiative (CSI) to enhance 
anti-terrorist control measures.   Implementation of the 
program remains pending. 
 
4. On February 9, Spain initiated cooperation with the U.S. 
in the Strait of Gibraltar Escort Operation in the 
protection of U.S. ships transporting military material to 
the Gulf area. 
 
5. Spain and France negotiated in November an agreement by 
which their respective police forces will be able to work in 
each other\'s country, investigating cases related to ETA, 
Islamic extremist terrorism, counternarcotics, trafficking 
in persons crimes, etc.  This agreement is a consequence of 
the EU 2002 agreement to create \"multi-national police 
investigation teams.\"  France and Spain are the first two 
countries that have negotiated the application of the EU 
agreement. 
 
6. With respect to the Iraq conflict, in August 2003, 1300 
Spanish troops deployed in Southern Iraq. 
 
G. and H. None 
 
I. CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------- 
 
Spain has suffered from ETA and other terrorist groups for 
over 30 years and has a deep commitment to using all legal 
means to combat terrorism, in Spain and internationally. 
Spain welcomes the increased international cooperation in 
combating terrorism that has emerged since 9-11.  Spanish 
leaders believe the global war on terrorism has translated 
into increased police, judicial and international political 
pressure on ETA that is taking a heavy toll on ETA\'s 
operational effectiveness.   Thanks to this pressure Spanish 
leaders believe that ETA is getting closer to being rendered 
inoperative as a coordinated terrorist organization.

for barrier-free transatlantic trade is going.  Escolano 
confessed that the GOS is in an anomalous situation -- a 
month ago Aznar launched his idea, but less than two months 
from now Aznar\'s administration will be history.  While it is 
almost a given that Aznar\'s party, the Popular Party, will 
win the elections, this administration is not in a position 
to make promises for the next government.  Escolano said the 
GOS would be satisfied if they could just plant the seed at 
the March Council of Europe and wait for the next Commission 
and enlarged EU to actually work on the idea. 
 
2. (C) Escolano confessed that he was expecting a very 
hostile reaction from the Commission and some Member States 
following Aznar\'s January 2004 speech to the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce.  Instead, he was pleasantly surprised that a 
\"majority\" of Member States and EU External Relations 
Commissioner Chris Patten were supportive.  Even EU Trade 
Commissioner Pascal Lamy was only mildly hostile.  The 
Germans and French have said nothing directly to the Spanish, 
which Escolano interprets as a good sign.  On the other hand, 
the UK, who the Spanish were counting on for support since 
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown had 
suggested a similar initiative, had not been as forthcoming 
as expected.  He also told us that they had not received a 
response to their letter explaining the initiative from EU 
President Romano Prodi, but had really not been expecting 
one.  They understand he is contemplating his own future and 
won\'t likely be interested in new initiatives at this stage. 
The Spanish hope that there will be enough Member State 
support to put the Aznar Initiative on the March Council 
agenda.  The Irish Presidency is open to doing so provided it 
has some signal of support from the larger Member States. 
 
3.  (SBU) Also important, Escolano said, are the missing 
words of support from high-level USG officials.  We replied 
that Washington has looked at the idea with interest, and 
that Commerce Secretary Evans had discussed it 
enthusiastically in Davos, however the USG was looking for 
more details.  Escolano said that providing details up front 
would be a mistake since it would focus opposition.  With the 
U.S., Spain, other Member States and the Commission all 
looking at elections and changes, the time was wrong for 
fleshing out Aznar\'s initial vision.  The GOS feels the 
details should come after there is support for the concept in 
general. 
 
4. (C) Escolano said the GOS also would be watching closely 
to see if the issue is discussed at the British-German-French 
Tripartite Meeting on February 18, and if such a discussion 
results in an endorsement (or rejection) of the idea.  He 
said the meeting could be key to the future viability of the 
initiative as he is concerned that the lukewarm response from 
the UK might be a signal that the UK is willing to sacrifice 
its traditional support for a broad transatlantic economic 
area to achieve other objectives.  The Tripartite Meeting was 
clearly a sore point for Escolano.  Whereas last year, he 
said, the Tripartite Meeting could be easily understood by 
other member states as necessary to mend rifts that arose 
during the run-up to the war in Iraq.  But now, Italy and 
Spain are watching with caution as the get-together is taking 
on all the trappings of a permanent meeting.  Escolano 
described it as an alliance against the nature of the EU, 
against the idea that all Member States, no matter how small, 
have a role.   He lamented that the EU risked becoming an 
institution in which the only constant would be the ongoing 
fight over its budget. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: It was evident from our discussion that 
Escolano realizes that the timing of the Aznar Initiative is 
far from perfect, both in terms of the GOS ability to 
follow-up and of Commission interest to engage.  For better 
or worse, Aznar put this idea on the table and his staff will 
try to secure the momentum and support to keep it alive for 
the next Spanish government and Commission.  The initiative\'s 
inclusion on the March Council agenda will likely be key to 
keeping the chatter surrounding the initiative alive.

In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. 
In the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of

TAGS: ECON, TBIO, TSPL, ETRD, SENV, EAGR, KPAL, SP, Trade Issues 
SUBJECT: BIOTECH OUTREACH PROPOSAL: HIGHLIGHTING SPAIN\'S BT 
CORN SUCCESS STORY 
 
REF: STATE 15050 
 
1. In response to reftel, Embassy\'s Biotechnology Working 
Group would like to propose creating a video to record and 
widely disseminate Spain\'s positive experience with planting 
and commercializing Bt corn.  While local estimates for 
executing our project proposal are likely too high to be 
completely funded with EB\'s anticipated FY2004 public 
diplomacy money, we offer a couple of ideas on how to proceed 
if there is sufficient interest. 
 
SPAIN AND Bt CORN: A SUCCESS STORY 
 
2. Spain is the only country in the EU planting Bt corn 
commercially (for feed).  The GOS first approved a Bt variety 
for planting in 1998, largely to combat losses inflicted by 
the European Corn Borer (ECB), and followed with approval of 
five additional varieties in 2003.  Nine further approvals 
are reportedly forthcoming.  The GOS originally limited 
planting surface to 25,000 hectares, but raised the level in 
2003 to 50,000 hectares.  A total of 32,000 hectares were 
planted in 2003, and the number is expected to rise this 
year. 
 
3. Spain\'s experience is not only novel in that Bt corn has 
been planted and commercialized here for over 5 years with 
minimal opposition, but also in that there are no known cases 
of Spanish farmers who have suffered losses or damages 
because of \"contamination\" of their grain.  Spanish corn 
traders have devised ways to ensure that the corn grain they 
buy in Spain has less than 0.1% GM content, including 
agreements with individual co-ops, a system of tracking the 
product starting from the seed invoice to the farmer, and an 
agreement with the Swiss company Societe Generale de 
Surveillance (SGS) to carry out testing and certification at 
various steps in the commercialization chain.  In other 
words, Spain has dealt successfully with coexistence issues 
even in the absence of formal coexistence regulations sought 
by some EU member states.  And they have done it while 
maintaining what many farmers have found to be a commercial 
advantage of Bt over non-Bt corn. 
 
PROPOSAL: SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS 
 
4. Our idea is to disseminate the message of Spain\'s success 
by creating a short video recounting the history of Spain\'s 
planting and commercialization of Bt corn and highlighting 
the perspective of the farmers and traders involved.  We 
believe that we would have cooperative Spanish partners in 
ASAJA, the main farmers union, CESFAC, the Feed Compounders 
Association, AGPME, the Corn Growers Association, FIAB, the 
Food and Beverage Industry Association, and, perhaps, the 
Spanish central and/or local governments.  The video would be 
filmed in Spanish, making it a useful tool for Embassies in 
Latin America in educating farmers, traders, NGOs and 
government officials on Spain\'s experience.  With subtitling, 
Embassies in Africa and Asia could do likewise. 
 
5. Local estimates for filming and editing a fifteen minute 
video ranged between 17,000-24,000 Euros for a high quality 
studio product and approximately 5,000 Euros for an amateur 
version.  While it may not be possible to fund the project 
exclusively out of EB public diplomacy monies, regional 
bureaus or other agencies (USTR, Agriculture) may be 
interested in pitching in.  We could also approach the 
Spanish government to co-fund, particularly given the 
product\'s potential utility in Latin America. 
 
6. Embassy would be happy to work with Washington on this 
project.

E. Yes.  Owing to its geographic location, Spain has a 
large Muslim population, some of which is undoubtedly 
sympathetic to the Jihadi cause.  Terrorist organizations 
are known to have used Spain\'s large Islamic population 
as a recruiting ground. 
 
F. It is possible with Spain being a strong ally and 
currently having troops positioned in Iraq, and being a 
high-profile proponent of the fight against terrorism, 
that there could be attacks or other terrorist acts 
against Americans in Spain. 
 
G. Weapons and explosive materials are available and can 
be acquired.

SUBJECT: ENCOURAGING SPAIN TO PURSUE BUSINESS IN IRAQ 
 
REF: PRAGUE 145 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Judy Garber; Reasons 4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  With continued \"bad press\" over the lack of 
Iraq reconstruction-related contracts for Spanish firms, we 
met with Ministry of Economy\'s Director General for 
Commercial Policy Carlos Jimenez to share lessons learned 
reftel.  Our overtures were welcome, but we also received a 
clear message that no GOS official would be willing engage 
publicly on any aspect of Iraq reconstruction prior to March 
14 elections.   Jimenez noted Spanish companies no longer 
believe they will receive a fair shake in the process and are 
instead waiting for the introduction of bilateral credits 
sometime in 2005.  He also complained about delays in the 
signing of the contract for the production of the next 
tranche of Iraqi dinars.   We plan to continue to engage 
Jimenez and others on these issues to demonstrate our 
transparency and good will in this process but are 
anticipating little return on our efforts until after the 
elections.  End Summary. 
 
The Frustration Continues 
 
2. (SBU) We met February 12 with Jimenez, to share the 
positive experience of the recent Czech business delegation 
to Iraq (reftel) and encourage the Spanish to consider a 
similar trip to help their companies better compete for Iraq 
reconstruction contracts.  We also shared some of the 
\"lessons learned\" from the Czech experience and offered to 
work with the GOS and the Coalition Provisional Authority 
(CPA) to help set up a Spanish delegation visit. 
 
3. (C) Jimenez appreciated the suggestion.  He made clear, 
however, that the Ministry of Economy\'s efforts in Iraq are 
somewhat on hold until after the March 14 general elections. 
Senior GOS officials believe, Jimenez explained, that it 
would be extremely damaging to the governing Popular Party\'s 
efforts to win, particularly with an absolute majority, if 
there were any injuries or deaths of Spanish nationals during 
the electoral period.  The fewer Spaniards in Iraq on 
official business, the better.  For example, Spain\'s 
Counselor for Commercial Affairs still operates out of 
Madrid. 
 
4. (C) Jimenez added that other factors are also in play. 
One is the bitterness that has settled into the business and 
government sectors regarding Spanish companies\' lack of 
success in obtaining contracts.  Although Spain is very happy 
that two of its construction companies, Dragados and 
Soluziona, teamed with CH2MHill to win the $12 million Army 
Corps of Engineers contract to build an electric plant in 
northern Iraq, many still resent the loss of a recent CPA 
contract to equip the Iraqi Armed Forces (note: the U.S. Nour 
Group won).  The Ministry of Defense had coordinated the bid 
by about 30 Spanish companies, and strongly believed the bid 
met perfectly the requirements of the RFP and offered a 
reasonable price.  According to Jimenez, State Secretary for 
Defense (and Commissioner for Iraq) Diez Moreno is still 
angry about the loss, particularly because he felt that the 
RFP had been somewhat amended later in the process to favor 
the American company.  He has reportedly sent a letter to DOD 
Comptroller Dov Zakheim on this issue (we have requested a 
copy).  Jimenez said that since most of the \"real\" money for 
Iraq is coming out of the U.S., Spanish companies believe the 
best way to get on board is to partner with U.S. companies 
and to lobby in Washington.  Some GOS officials believe that 
the CPA is already transforming into the future U.S. Embassy 
in Baghdad and are therefore less tuned in to third-party 
interests.  Finally, Jimenez pointed out that while the GOS 
will distribute some of its Madrid pledge this fiscal year, 
the GOS has not budgeted for Hispano-Iraqi business credits 
until 2005, when the GOS hopes to negotiate an agreement with 
a sovereign government. 
 
The Dinar Contract - Again 
 
5. (C) Conversation turned to the visit CPA\'s Tom Foley 
offered to make to Madrid this month to explain to Spanish 
companies how to take advantage of commercial opportunities 
in Iraq.  Jimenez said that while the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs had requested the visit, First Vice President and 
Minister of Economy Rato later decided that the visit should 
not happen in the run-up to the March election. 
 
6. (C) Additionally, Jimenez related Economy Ministry 
frustration over a pending contract for Spanish companies to 
produce additional Iraqi Dinars.  According to Jimenez, CPA 
had requested the contract on an urgent basis, but after the 
Spanish sent a draft 2-3 weeks ago, nothing happened. 
Ministry of Economy official Carlos Molina plans to return to 
Iraq with a new contract to try to get the ball rolling 
again.  (Note: Another GOS official speculated that CPA may 
be requiring some formal signal of GOS approval before 
signing the contract.  He asured us the GOS is fully on board 
to fund.  End note.) 
 
Comment 
 
7. (C) While there are numerous reasons for Spanish 
companies\' failure to get contracts in Iraq, including 
security concerns and Spanish uncertainty over how to pursue 
contracts, the bottom line is that both business and 
government are extremely sensitive on this issue.  Press 
reports add fuel to the fire.  An illustrative headline is 
one that appeared in the February 6 El Pais daily, \"The U.S. 
leaves Spain out of the big contract to supply the Iraqi 
Army.\" 
8. (C) It is clear that the current Administration has 
decided not to pursue at this time any commercial initiatives 
that involve travel to Iraq or meeting with CPA officials to 
discuss contracting issues.  After the March elections, we 
will revisit with Ministry of Economy contacts the option of 
a GOS-led business delegation visit to Baghdad.

SUBJECT: SPANISH ELECTION OUTLOOK: ONE MONTH OUT, POPULAR 
PARTY HOLDING ON TO LEAD 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires J. Robert Manzanares, 
reasons 1.4(B) and (D). 
 
Summary 
 
1.  (C) Polls one month before the March 14 Spanish general 
election continue to point to victory for the Popular Party 
and Aznar\'s successor as party leader, Mariano Rajoy.  The PP 
hopes not just for a plurality, but for an absolute majority. 
 Were the PP to fall far short of an absolute majority, 
coalition formation would prove troublesome.   Most polling 
consistently shows the PP hovering just short of the absolute 
majority threshold. Socialist leader Rodriguez Zapatero has 
sought to breathe new life into his campaign by exploiting 
the Iraq/WMD controversy, criticizing Aznar for joining the 
Iraq coalition.  Most analysts believe the Iraq issue will 
not be a major factor unless Spain\'s 1300 troops in Iraq 
suffer large casualties.  One month before the election, the 
outlook is similar to when Rajoy became Aznar\'s successor 
last September: the perception in Spain is that it is Rajoy\'s 
race to lose.  End Summary. 
 
Major Party Differences on Relations with the U.S. 
 
2.  (SBU) On March 14, Spaniards will go to the polls to 
select a new Parliament, which will, in turn, select a new 
Prime Minister, known in Spain as \"President of the 
Government.\"  Polling data and political commentary have, for 
the past six months, pointed to a plurality for the PP, led 
by Aznar\'s successor as party leader, Mariano Rajoy.  This 
trend continues.  Most polls show the PP leading by seven or 
eight points over the Socialists. 
 
3.  (C) Rajoy and Socialist  (PSOE) leader Jose Luis 
Rodriguez Zapatero offer distinct domestic and foreign policy 
choices to the Spanish electorate.  Rajoy has pledged to 
maintain Aznar\'s strong ties with the US, including its close 
counter-terrorism cooperation and participation in the Iraq 
coalition.  He also promises to keep Spain\'s vigorous economy 
on track and preserve the integrity of the Spanish state in 
the face of nationalist pressures in the Basque and Catalunya 
regions. 
 
4.  (C) Zapatero, in contrast, pledges to re-focus Spain on 
Europe.  Zapatero argues that Aznar\'s tilt to the US has 
damaged Spain\'s standing in the EU, where the Socialists see 
their country\'s future.  Zapatero has been a relentless 
critic of Aznar\'s Iraq policy and what he sees as Aznar\'s 
\"subservience\" to the Bush Administration.  Zapatero says he 
will establish a transatlantic relationship based on \"mutual 
respect and friendship,\" not on submission. 
 
5.  (C) Zapatero also strongly criticized Aznar for appearing 
before a joint meeting of Congress February 4, saying that 
Aznar was willing to go before the US Congress while ignoring 
Socialist calls for him to appear before a special session of 
the Spanish parliament (in recess because of the elections) 
to explain pre-war intelligence on WMD in Iraq.  On the 
domestic front, Zapatero pledges to increase social spending 
for education, health and culture.  He has promised not to 
raise taxes and says he will pay for these programs by 
reducing defense spending. 
 
6.  (C) Despite efforts to shift attention again to Iraq, 
Zapatero has been unable to turn popular opposition to 
Aznar\'s Iraq policy (which brought millions of Spaniards into 
the streets in February and March 2003) into support for his 
candidacy.  On February 12, Zapatero said that if elected, he 
would withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq in July if the 
mission had not been turned over to the UN by that date. 
Zapatero misses no opportunity to call the war \"illegal and 
immoral\" and to denounce Aznar for ignoring Spanish interests 
by allying Spain with what Zapatero calls \"the most 
conservative US Administration in history.\" 
 
Role of Aznar 
 
7.  (C) The manager of the PP\'s national campaign, Gabriel 
Elorriaga (who is also State Secretary for Public 
Administration), told us in late January that one of the 
major challenges for the PP in the campaign is how to deploy 
Aznar.  Elorriaga conceded that the PP needs to be careful 
not to overshadow Rajoy or antagonize the Socialist ranks and 
provoke greater Socialist turnout.  Nonetheless, thus far, 
and consistent with his personal style, Aznar has been out in 
front ) and far more on the attack than Rajoy.  On February 
10, in a typical jibe, Aznar declared that the Socialists 
have no coherent leader or party and are not fit to govern 
Spain.  He demanded that Zapatero tell Catalan Socialists to 
break their coalition with the Catalan Republican ERC, whose 
leader, Carod Robira, met with ETA leaders in France in early 
January. 
 
8.  (C) Zapatero continues to focus his criticism largely on 
Aznar, rather than Rajoy.  Rajoy\'s strategists tell us 
privately that this suits them just fine because the Iraq 
issue in particular is identified with Aznar, rather than 
Rajoy.  Thus Aznar takes the heat while Rajoy enjoys a 
widespread reputation, even among Socialists, as more of a 
bridge-builder, with a far less dominating personality than 
Aznar. 
 
9.  (C) Some in his own party have criticized Rajoy, a 
veteran of eight years in key Ministerial portfolios in 
Aznar\'s two governments, for conducting an overly scripted 
and risk-averse \"rose garden\" campaign.  Rajoy has resisted 
pressure from the Socialists to publicly debate Zapatero, for 
example.  Others point out, however, that Spaniards vote 
according to party lists, not necessarily on personalities -- 
a key difference between the Spanish and US systems -- and 
therefore the lack of a high profile is not necessarily a 
negative for Rajoy. 
 
Absolute Majority: the Numbers and Turnout 
 
10.  (C) The PP needs 176 seats in the 350-seat Congress of 
Deputies (lower house) to form an absolute majority.  In 
2000, the PP won an absolute majority of 183 seats.  In 1996 
the PP won 146 seats and formed a coalition government.  Some 
of the 1996 coalition partners, such as the Basque 
Nationalist PNV, would not enter into a coalition with PP 
today. 
 
11.  (C) PP campaign manager Elorriaga told us he was 
confident the PP would win at least 171 seats this time and 
said that if the campaign went well, the PP could hope for an 
absolute majority, although he conceded this would be 
difficult.  Elorriaga believed that the 183 seats the PP 
received in 2000 represented the PP\'s electoral ceiling.   He 
doubted they would reach it in 2004 given the eight years of 
PP government and the natural desire of the public for a 
change. 
 
12.  (C) Should the PP fall four or five seats short of 176, 
Elorriaga said they can count on the Canary Coalition (a 
regional Canary Islands party) to cover that margin.  Beyond 
that, coalition formation becomes problematic for the PP. 
Most PP analysts believe that CIU, the moderate Catalan 
nationalist party (which had 15 seats last legislature), 
would be willing to work out a deal with the PP, if it came 
to that.  However PP strategists are not sure this would 
happen and would like to avoid this contingency. 
 
13.  (C) PP strategists and other analysts, including 
Elorriaga, focused on the issue of voter turnout.  Elorriaga 
told us that the PP wanted to mobilize its people but avoid 
public gloating that could antagonize the Socialists and 
mobilize them against the PP.  He said polls before the 1993 
general election had been favorable for the PP but that the 
PP had committed the error of holding large rallies on the 
eve of the election that, ironically, mobilized the 
socialists against them and helped cost the PP the election. 
Elorriaga said that over-confidence was a major danger for 
the PP. 
 
The Alternative to a PP Victory: Government of the Left 
 
14.  (C) The likely alternative to a PP victory is a 
coalition of the Socialists and the Left Union (Communists) 
supported by nationalists such as the Basque Nationalist 
Party (PNV).   Zapatero has stated that he would not seek to 
form a government unless the Socialists get the most votes 
nationwide.  Nonetheless, many analysts believe that if it 
came to it, the Socialists would lead such an \"anybody but 
the PP\" coalition.  The PSOE sought to do it in the Madrid 
region last October and have done it in the Balearic Islands 
and elsewhere. 
 
Comment 
 
15.  (C) The percepction in Spain is that the March 14 
election remains the PP\'s to lose.   Despite polls that show 
that a majority of Spaniards favors the idea of a change in 
government, the PP has enjoyed a solid lead for months.  The 
Socialists, as a consequence of their disunity and weak 
leadership, have been unable to capitalize on a general 
desire for change.  However, there are a few wildcards that 
have the potential to change the equation.  These include 
possible large Spanish casualties in Iraq and a possible 
backfiring of Rajoy\'s cautious approach to campaigning and 
his unwillingness to debate Zapatero.  Nonetheless, as it now 
stands, the majority of analysts, including many Socialist 
contacts, expect the PP to form the next government.  What 
they do not agree on is whether the PP will receive an 
absolute majority.  The polling is inconclusive.  If Zapatero 
can prevent the PP from gaining an absolute majority ) which 
would involve the PP\'s loss of at least 8 seats ) he might 
be able to claim some victory and remain PSOE leader.  Should 
the PP win an absolute majority, the knives among the 
Socialists may well come out for Zapatero.   A resounding 
PSOE electoral defeat, were it to occur, might well bring 
calls for one of the longtime Socialist barons, such as Bono 
from Castilla La Mancha or Chavez from Andalusia to come to 
the PSOE\'s rescue.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, ECON, SP 
SUBJECT: Spanish Film Campaign: Promotion or Protectionism? 
 
 
1. Spain\'s film industry has kicked off 2004 with a campaign 
aimed at promoting Spanish films by belittling those \"made 
in the USA.\" Despite the campaign\'s anti-American tone, 
there\'s no need for Hollywood to worry yet. GOS policy, as 
voiced by President Aznar, suggests that the introduction of 
market access barriers is highly unlikely. 
 
2. Spanish film producers started the New Year with the aim 
of improving their box office profits.  Although film 
production in Spain increased from 114 movies in 2002 to 126 
movies in 2003, the ten most-seen Spanish films accounted 
for 70% to 80% of Spanish film sales.  In an attempt to 
promote Spanish movies, producers from the Federacin de 
Asociaciones de Productores Audiovisuales (Fapae) initiated 
a campaign based on the slogan \"You need to come see us.\" 
The aim of the producers was to remind viewers that Spanish 
films are different from international films.  While Fapae 
said the campaign wasn\'t anti-Hollywood, the ads obviously 
referred to the U.S. 
 
3. The campaign consisted of three commercials that were 
screened in theaters or aired on television for a period of 
fifteen days.  The president of Fapae Pedro Perez made a 
press statement assuring that the message is not against 
anyone, not even Hollywood.  \"Taxista\" or taxi-driver was 
the first commercial, which underscored the difference 
between Spanish culture, when two taxi-drivers meet and 
greet each other using hand-shakes and gestures, reflecting 
those of hip-hop.  Another commercial \"Halloween,\" questions 
why aspects of foreign cultures are adopted into Spanish 
culture.  The message of the last of three advertisements, 
\"Batedor\" or baseball batter, was that Spanish cinema is 
equally capable of producing movies.  Although the 
commercials are comical, they make obvious references to 
American culture, complicating Perez\' claim that these 
campaigns are not targeted at, as the newspaper El Mundo put 
it, its \"archenemy the American cinema.\" 
 
4. Despite the anti-U.S. overtones, it\'s unlikely the U.S. 
film industry should be concerned about a backlash against 
American films in Spain.  We spoke with Secretary General 
Estela Artacho of Fedicine, a confederation representing 
American film and Spanish film industries.  Although Spanish 
producers would support protectionist measures, Artacho 
opined that given the present Aznar administration\'s liberal 
trade policies and its strong ties to the U.S., 
protectionist measures are unlikely.  In his recent trip to 
the U.S., Aznar condemned the French degree of cultural 
protectionism.  Currently, the only form of protection in 
Spain is a long-standing movie quota of one EU-film for 
every three non EU-films. Artacho was convinced that the 
American film industry was not significantly affected by 
this quota. 
 
5. A closer look at the Spanish film sector can explain that 
the campaign is not driven politically, but rather, it has 
been initiated by the economics of the film sector.  For the 
second consecutive year, movie attendance has dropped 
sharply in Spain.  For 2002 and 2003, there was a total loss 
of nearly 17 million viewers.  On the other hand, there were 
some minimal improvements for Spanish films, which gained 
500,000 viewers-an increase in market share from 13.7% to 
16% in 2003. 
 
6. CONCLUSION.  Last year\'s sales figures have been an eye- 
opener for Spanish film producers. They have opted to 
attract more viewers to their films by branding their film 
industry. For now, the U.S. film industry will probably be 
unaffected by the new campaigns.  The possibility of other 
measures being taken depends largely on the future situation 
of the Spanish film sector.

E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, SP 
SUBJECT: SPANISH HOUSING COSTS: A GROWING ECONOMIC AND 
POLITICAL CONCERN 
 
1. SUMMARY:  Recent public opinion polls show that rising 
housing prices are a serious concern of the Spanish public. 
Between 1997 and 2002, housing prices rose 78% in real 
terms.  A hot real estate market based on strong demand and 
low interest rates has fed the sharp increase.  Government 
regulation, which restricts the development of available 
land, has also impacted housing prices.  The economic 
consensus is that prices are overvalued.  Some conclude 
that a property bubble has been forming, but government 
officials and the majority of private sector analysts 
believe a gradual correction is coming without a \"bubble 
bursting\".  Still, given the economic implications of a 
sharp fall in housing prices and public anxiety over 
affordable housing, the ruling Popular Party (PP) and the 
opposition Socialist party (PSOE) are both making housing 
policy a central plank of their economic platforms in the 
upcoming national elections.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------- 
HOUSING COSTS--A BIG ISSUE IN SPAIN 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  The price of real estate in Spain has become a key 
issue in the run up to the March national elections.  A 
survey from the Center of Sociological Studies (CIS) 
published in December noted that 22% of Spaniards consider 
rising housing prices a serious personal concern, and 19% 
of the population considers housing to be one of the 
nation\'s most critical problems.  Both percentages have 
risen significantly in recent months.  Housing concerns 
were identified as the third most important personal issue 
in Spain after unemployment and economic problems, and the 
fourth most important issue facing the nation. 
 
3. Press coverage has focused on Spaniards\' growing debt 
and the challenge of paying mortgages.  In Madrid, the 
average family requires 70% of its salary (EUR 37,383 per 
year - USD 47,103 at an exchange rate of EUR 1=USD 1.26) to 
pay the mortgage over fifteen years at an interest rate of 
4.3%.  Housing payments vary in other regions: 65% of 
average salary in Catalonia, 68% in the Basque Country, and 
on the low end of the spectrum, 39% in Murcia and Galicia. 
In 2003, Spanish personal debt reached historic levels, and 
mortgages accounted for four-fifths. 
 
------------------------- 
THE SPANISH PROPERTY BOOM 
------------------------- 
 
4. The average price of new housing has doubled in Spain in 
the last eight years, rising 78% between 1997 and 2002. 
The increase in property values in 2003 alone was an 
estimated 17%.  The causes of the boom, according to recent 
studies by the Spanish Savings Bank Confederation (FUNCAS) 
and the Bank of Spain, include a scarcity of homes in the 
housing market, the Spanish preference to buy rather than 
rent, a poor rental market and a lack of transparency in 
government real estate regulation. 
 
5.  What is clear from the significant rise in housing 
prices in the past few years is that the supply of housing 
is lower than existing demand.  More buyers are appearing 
in the Spanish market: single Spaniards, divorced 
Spaniards, immigrants and foreign retirees.  Low interest 
rates and easy credit make these customers eager to 
purchase.  The resulting construction boom has failed to 
satiate demand or slow the rise in prices.  Spain is 
currently on track to construct over 500,000 new homes for 
the fourth consecutive year, a quantity that accounts for 
40% of total EU new home construction over that period. 
Despite additional supply, housing prices have grown three 
times as fast as salaries over the most recent four-year 
period.  Spain now has a housing price to wage ratio among 
the highest of EU countries. 
 
6. Spanish investment habits add additional fuel to the 
property boom.  Real estate is the chief form of investment 
in Spain, even though the Spanish stock market was one of 
the world\'s best performing in 2003.  According to Miguel 
Blesa, Chairman of Caja Madrid (Spain\'s fourth largest 
bank), 80% of Spaniards put their savings in ladrillo 
(bricks and mortar) and only 20% in financial assets.  This 
compares to a North American profile of 60% in financial 
assets and 40% in property. 
 
7. Unlike in many developed countries, Spanish owners often 
let their investment property go vacant rather than renting 
it out.  Some say the Spanish cultural preference to own 
rather than rent creates a weak rental market.  Others 
point to Spanish rental law as a disincentive to 
prospective landlords.  As Norman Flynn, retired President 
of the U.S. National Association of Realtors, pointed out 
during a recent Madrid visit, it takes two years to evict 
delinquent renters under current Spanish legislation. 
 
8. Regulation and local government real estate policy also 
contribute to the rise in Spanish property costs.  Local 
governments control the amount of property available for 
new housing, creating a patchwork of policies across Spain. 
Many critics feel that local government decisions, which 
are often made without public input, are influenced by 
landowners who want to see their land values rise.  Other 
critics see the scarcity of land zoned for development as 
designed to maximize the local governments\' property tax 
income by artificially restricting supply.  Flynn noted the 
need for greater flexibility and transparency in Spanish 
real estate regulation, and he urged the Spanish to work 
towards a freer property market that can self-regulate. 
 
--------------- 
BUBBLE TROUBLE? 
--------------- 
 
9. Many economists agree current housing prices are 
overvalued.  The FUNCAS report estimates an overvaluation 
of up to 28%, while the Bank of Spain\'s study calculates an 
overvaluation of 8% to 20%.  Antonio Cortina Garcia, 
Assistant Director of Economic Research at Santander 
Central Hispano Bank agrees that prices are overvalued 
between 15% and 20%.  Numerous opinion and editorial pieces 
in the Spanish press have declared the existence of a price 
bubble that might burst and lead to real price decreases 
experienced during the 1990s and possibly even nominal 
price decreases.  (Note: Nominal housing prices have never 
fallen in Spain.  End Note.) 
 
10. While most experts agree that market overvaluation 
exists, Cortina agrees with the position of Bank of Spain 
Governor Jaime Caruana, who predicted a gentle and 
progressive correction in the property market.  Continuity 
of current low interest rates will be a key factor.  As 
consumers have acquired 98% of new homes through variable- 
rate mortgages, an interest rate hike would have 
significantly negative effects on household wealth and 
savings, as many pension nest eggs are tied to home value. 
 
11. The current PP government downplays the threat of a 
real estate crash.  At year\'s end, Spanish First Vice- 
President and Minister of Economy Rodrigo Rato publicly 
recognized housing in Spain as expensive, but noted \"this 
does not mean we are standing before a bubble that will 
involve a sharp price correction.\"  Only a sharp interest 
rate hike would cause such a change, and Rato believes 
rates will rise slowly and moderately from the current 2% 
to 4 or 4.5% over the medium term.  Bank of Spain Governor 
Caruana commented that Spain\'s financial institutions have 
\"done a good job\" of risk and resource management, and 
would be prepared to weather possible loan defaults 
resulting from interest rate rises. 
 
12. A minority of analysts asserts that Spanish real estate 
prices remain completely justified.  Angel Berges Lobera, 
Director General of Financial Analysts International (AFI) 
and Professor of Finance and Accounting at Madrid\'s 
Autonomous University, asserts that fundamentals fully 
justify current prices.  He cites the same inflationary 
factors as other experts, but does not calculate any 
overvaluation.  Furthermore, household debt levels and 
housing price-levels are not out of line, and have just 
recently attained average EU levels.  Not surprisingly, 
Spain\'s largest construction companies also join in denying 
any market overvaluation.  Fermin Molina, Director General 
at the Urbis construction company reflected the industry\'s 
general position: Spain\'s housing bubble is fiction 
\"invented by a few journalists.\" 
 
--------------- 
ELECTORAL ISSUE 
--------------- 
 
13. The current PP government\'s denial of a housing bubble 
has not kept it from addressing housing affordability as a 
key electoral issue.  According to Vicente Martinez- 
Pujalte, PP Economic Spokesperson in Parliament, housing is 
the economic issue on which the PP is most vulnerable in 
the March general elections.  PP presidential candidate 
Mariano Rajoy pledges the construction of 900,000 new 
government subsidized homes during the next parliamentary 
term should he be elected. A new type of government housing 
category will classify 200,000 units as purchasable at a 
maximum of EUR 165,000 (USD 208,000) with a low interest 
30-year loan for those that qualify.  He also wants to 
increase the amount of units available for rent.  His plan 
calls for the creation of a new state agency that would 
work with regional governments to increase the amount of 
public land available to build rental units.  Rajoy also 
proposes the movement of delinquent rent cases to courts 
after 20 days rather than the current 2 years.  Finally, to 
address the difficulties of younger homebuyers, he calls 
for house purchasing assistance from the government for 
200,000 qualified buyers less than 35 years of age. 
 
14.  The opposition PSOE has also made the issue a campaign 
theme.  The Socialist party line accuses the Administration 
of enacting legislation that encourages speculation, 
failing to recognize that many citizens cannot afford 
housing, and being content with the situation although 
Spain is the EU country in which it is most difficult to 
obtain housing.  They also accuse the ruling party of 
shunning debate by offering hollow responses to worries 
over increased prices such as \"When people buy homes, it is 
because they have the money to do so.\"  We expect the 
Socialists to increasingly emphasize this issue as the 
March election approaches. 
 
15. COMMENT: Though most analysts bet that any housing 
overvaluation will adjust gradually rather than abruptly, 
the PP government and the opposition are keenly aware of 
the political and economic issues surrounding the housing 
market.  On one hand, a large percentage of Spanish society 
wants housing costs to come down.  On the other hand, many 
Spaniards\' nest eggs for retirement are tied up in real 
estate.  With construction driving economic growth in 
recent years, a steep decline in housing prices, connected 
with a sharp slowdown in the market, would also drag on 
economic growth.  With interest rate policy outside of its 
control, the next government will need to carefully manage 
housing policy to assist those priced out of the market, 
and to prevent a collapse of a key sector of the Spanish 
economy.

SUBJECT: SUCCESS! NIKE WINS IN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT 
 
REF: A. 2002 MADRID 2134 
     B. 2003 MADRID 780 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: After more than 14 years of court battles, 
Nike has won a major victory in the Spanish Constitutional 
Court that once again allows the company to use its trademark 
(both the name and the swoosh) on apparel sold in Spain.  On 
February 16, in response to Nike\'s appeal of a negative 1999 
Supreme Court ruling, the Spanish Constitutional Court sided 
with Nike, annulling the other court\'s decision.  It returned 
the decision to the Supreme Court asking that it revise its 
decision based on the findings of Constitutional Court 
justices.  Nike is hoping that the new Supreme Court ruling, 
expected to be issued within the next 12 months, will be fair 
and objective.  They fear the new decision could be colored 
by an ongoing battle for power between the two Spanish 
courts. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (SBU) For over fourteen years, Nike has been pursuing a 
former Spanish business partner, Cidesport, in court in an 
attempt to gain control of the Nike trademark in Spain.  The 
problem stems from Cidesport\'s surreptitious acquisition in 
1981 of a trademark containing the Nike name.  Nike neglected 
to register its own trademark at that time.  After several 
unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a settlement, Nike finally 
began litigation at the end of 1989.  Nike was successful 
with a string of lower court case victories, but in 1999 lost 
a decisive appeal in the Civil Chamber of the Spanish Supreme 
Court.  (Note: The court has a Civil and an Administrative 
Chamber.)  The Supreme Court decision allowed the former 
business partner to sell clothing in Spain with the Nike 
name.  Nike was also allowed to sell clothing, however, the 
clothing could not bear the name Nike --- only the swoosh. 
 
3. (SBU) Nike was successful in convincing the Spanish 
Constitutional Court to accept an appeal of the Supreme Court 
decision.  The case had been pending over 3 years -- an 
unusually long wait, partly due to the serious illness and 
subsequent death of the justice assigned to the case.  In the 
interim, the Supreme Court issued other rulings harmful to 
Nike including a 2002 Administrative Chamber ruling that took 
the 1999 decision one step further and gave Cidesport the 
right to use a \"Nike Sportswear\" logo on both footwear and 
apparel. 
 
4. (SBU) On February 16, 2004, the Constitutional Court 
finally reached a decision favoring Nike.  The Constitutional 
Court annulled the Supreme Court\'s prior rulings, outlined 
the various legal errors made by the Supreme Court, and sent 
the 1999 decision back to the Supreme Court for a new and 
\"properly reasoned\" decision.  Industry insiders estimate it 
will likely take a year for the Supreme Court to issue a new 
decision, though some \"returned cases\" have been considered 
in just a matter of weeks.  In the meantime Nike has regained 
use of its entire logo, both name and swoosh.  Nike lawyers 
and officials are cautiously optimistic.  They say the 
Constitutional Court\'s decision reflected a good part of the 
reasoning they had used in their legal brief.  They are 
hoping the Supreme Court response will be objective. 
 
5. (SBU) One final twist in the Nike case involves an 
inter-court struggle for power between the Constitutional 
Court and the Supreme Court that has been going on for years. 
 In at least one example in the past few years, the Supreme 
Court took umbrage that the Constitutional Court returned a 
decision for reconsideration.  The Supreme Court revised its 
decision, but did so in a way that met the Constitutional 
Court\'s requirements, but essentially gutted the victory. 
Tensions between the two courts escalated this month when the 
Supreme Court accused the Constitutional Court of a judicial 
misstep and humiliated the justices by requiring them to pay 
restitution to a local lawyer. 
 
6. (SBU) The 1999 Supreme Court decision barring Nike from 
selling clothes with its logo in Spain has cost the company 
tens of millions of dollars in separate production runs and 
lost sales.  Throughout the legal struggle, the company has 
asked us on numerous occasions to advocate on their behalf to 
various GOS ministries.  While we have not wanted to 
interfere in independent judicial proceedings, we have on 
many occasions spoken and written to various GOS officials to 
underscore the importance of intellectual property rights and 
the negative implications of Nike\'s ongoing court troubles. 
This week, in view of the latest judicial ruling, we have 
been delicately asking relevant contacts if they believe the 
inter-court feud could prejudice the final Nike Supreme Court 
ruling.

directing the case against a Spain-based al Qaeda cell, led 
by Eddin Barakat Yarkas (a Syrian born naturalized Spanish 
citizen).   Barakat Yarkas was arrested in November 2001 and 
remains in Spanish custody along with other cell members, 
awaiting trial. 
 
2.  (C)  Judge Garzon, accompanied by Spanish National Police 
Inspector (Comisario) Rafael Gomez Menor, met with Snell and 
Kim for three hours on February 13.    Embassy political 
officer accompanied.   Garzon outlined the activities of the 
Barakat Yarkas al Qaeda cell, such as its recruitment for al 
Qaeda camps.   Snell and Kim were particularly interested in 
Spanish police phone taps of cryptic conversations between 
Barakat Yarkas and a contact in the UK.   The contact, who 
has never been identified and is known only as \"Shakur,\" told 
Barakat Yarkas (in Arabic) in August 2001 that something 
would happen in the next few weeks that he would like and 
made comments to the effect that the \"bird\'s\" throat would be 
cut.   Garzon and Gomez believe these conversations indicate 
a foreknowledge of the 9-11 conspiracy. 
 
3.  (C)  Gomez Menor, who is the head of the police unit 
investigating the case, narrated a power point presentation 
for Snell and Kim on the Barakat Yarkas cell members and 
their activities.   Garzon and Gomez also discussed with 
Snell and Kim the possibilities that Barkat Yarkas or members 
of his cell might have been in contact with Mohamad Atta or 
other 9-11 conspirators during Atta\'s two visits to Spain in 
2001. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Prior to the meeting with Garzon, Snell and Kim, 
as they had requested, had a meeting at the Embassy with 
Legat, who was accompanied by a lawyer from FBI headquarters. 
  They also paid a courtesy call on the Charge.   Snell and 
Kim departed for Berlin on February 14.

3.  THREAT ASSESSMENT: 
 
In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. 
In the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SP, Popular Party, PSOE - Socialist Party, Spanish Election March 2004 
SUBJECT: THE SPANISH NATIONAL ELECTIONS:  FREQUENTLY ASKED 
QUESTIONS (FAQS) 
 
1.  (U)  This cable aims at providing \"at a glance\" answers 
to questions we have received from Washington audiences about 
the upcoming Spanish national elections, including the 
complexities of Spain\'s parliamentary system and its regional 
aspects. 
 
2.  (U)  WHEN ARE THE NATIONAL ELECTIONS? 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Sunday, March 14, 2004 
 
3.  (U)  WHAT\'S AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION? 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
-- All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies. 
 
-- All 208 elected seats in the Senate. (an additional 51 
seats are appointed by the regional governments (called 
Autonomous Communities)) 
 
-- President of the Government (Prime Minister). Not voted on 
directly, but selected by the Congress of Deputies. 
 
-- Separate elections for regional assembly and government in 
Andalucia. 
 
4.  (U)  HOW ARE SEATS ALLOCATED AND MEMBERS ELECTED TO THE 
CONGRESS OF DEPUTIES? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
-- Each of the 50 provinces is entitled to a minimum of two 
seats = 100 seats 
 
-- The autonomous cities of Ceuta & Melilla receive one seat 
each = 2 seats 
 
-- The remainder of the 248 seats are allocated to the 50 
provinces in proportion to their populations (Ceuta and 
Melilla are excluded) 
 
-- Voters do not choose individual candidates, but rather 
vote for a party list.  The political parties assign 
candidates for each province list.  Those candidates  do not 
necessarily have to be residents of the province, as members 
of Congress serve the nation, not their constituency. 
Constituency issues are handled by the regional, provincial 
and local governments or in the Senate, which has the 
responsibility of managing the relations between the national 
government and the regions. 
 
-- The candidates on the list are ranked-ordered by the 
party, with the rank designating the preference in which 
candidates will receive any seats won by the party.  For 
example, if a party wins three seats in a province, the top 
three names on its list will take a seat in Congress. 
Parties strategically place those they wish to ensure are 
elected by placing them at the head of a list or in a 
province where they expect to win enough seats to reach the 
candidate. 
 
-- In order to participate in the allocation of seats, a 
party must win at least 3% of all valid votes cast (this 
includes blank ballets) in their respective provinces. 
 
-- From the votes cast, seats are assigned in each province 
by a proportional representation formula, called the D,Hondt 
Method. 
 
5.  (SBU)  DOES THE SYSTEM HAVE ANY BIASES? 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
The D\'Hondt Method\'s proportional-representational formula 
tends to over-represent the party that wins the highest 
percent of the vote, and under-represents the smallest 
parties.  It also benefits parties who agree to unite and run 
a combined candidate list, providing more seats than if the 
parties agreed to coalition after the election. 
 
6.  (SBU)  HAVE THE TWO MAJOR LEFT-LEANING PARTIES CONSIDERED 
RUNNING TOGETHER THIS ELECTION TO DEFEAT THE RULING 
CONSERVATIVES? 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
No, the Socialists (PSOE) and the far-left party (Izquierda 
Unida) have not run combined lists since the reintroduction 
of democracy.  Socialists and \"communists\" uniting (which is 
still remembered as being the constituents of the Popular 
Front coalition of the mid-1930,s) would likely drive some 
voters away, negating any benefit of the union.  The 
Socialists and far leftists have had agreements and joint 
candidate lists in regional races in Catalonia and Mallorca. 
 
7.  (U)  HOW IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT (PRIME 
MINISTER) SELECTED? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
-- Indirectly, by majority vote of the Congress of Deputies. 
 
-- Just as political parties select the closed-list of 
candidates for Congress, the parties also select their 
candidates for President.  These are in practice designated 
before the election, but in theory, a party could put forward 
a different candidate after the election. 
-- The Presidential candidates run for a position in the 
Congress at the top of the party list in a given province ) 
usually Madrid. 
-- The political party which wins the largest number of seats 
will be invited by the King to form a government. 
 
-- The candidate for President of the Government (PM) then 
presents his program (similar to party platforms in the US, 
giving the candidate,s proposals for social, economic and 
foreign policy, etc.) to the Congress.  After this 
presentation, the Congress votes to approve the candidate, 
who must be approved by an absolute majority* of the 
Congress.  If this does not happen, the candidate can return 
to the Congress (approximately one week later) and win the 
Presidency with a simple majority*. 
 
-- After the installation of a new government, the party can 
designate one or more Vice Presidents, but the position of 
Vice President in Spain does not necessarily go to the 
party,s next most influential member(s). 
 
Note 
*Absolute majority means a majority representing more than 
half the number voting (In the case of the Congress of 
Deputies, 176 votes of the total 350).  Simple majority means 
the greatest number of votes. 
 
8.  (U)  HAVE THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES EVER HAD TO SHARE POWER? 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
No. Since the reintroduction of democracy in 1977, one of the 
major parties has always been able to either win an absolute 
majority or coalition with smaller parties to win a majority 
and select their President. 
 
9.  (U)  IS THERE A CONTROLLED CAMPAIGN TIME? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Official campaigning begins two weeks before the actual 
elections.  All canvassing for votes must cease one day 
before the actual election day, and no campaigning is 
permitted either on the last day (\"day of reflection\") or on 
election day. 
 
10.  (U)  WHO ARE THE MAIN PARTIES  IN THE ELECTORAL RACE? 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
The two main parties are: 
PP ) Popular Party; Leader:  Mariano Rajoy 
PSOE ) Spanish Socialist Worker,s Party; Leader:  Jose Luis 
Rodriguez Zapatero 
 
Others include: 
CiU ) Convergence and Union (Moderate Catalan Nationalists); 
Leader:  Josep Antoni Duran i Lleida 
IU ) United Left; Leader:  Gaspar Llamazares 
PNV ) Basque Nationalist Party; Leader:  Josu Jon Imaz 
CC ) Canarian Coalition; Leader:  Paulino Rivero 
BNG ) Galician Nationalist Bloc; Leader:  Anxo Quintana 
AP ) Andalusian Party; Leader:  Antonio Ortega 
ERC ) Catalonia,s Republican Left; Leader:  Josep-Lluis 
Carod-Rovira 
 
11.  (SBU)  HOW DO THE TWO MAIN PARTIES COMPARE ON POLICY? 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
The ruling Popular Party (PP), led by Mariano Rajoy, has 
pledged to continue the PP,s commitment to a strong 
transatlantic alliance, supporting a Spanish military role in 
Iraq peacekeeping efforts and maintaining close ties with the 
United States in the War on Terrorism.  The PP also promises 
to keep the strong economy on track and to preserve the 
integrity of the Spanish state from growing nationalist 
pressures in Catalonia and the Basque Country. 
 
The Spanish Socialist Worker,s Party (PSOE), led by Jose 
Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has agreed to maintain the Spanish 
presence in Iraq until the end of the current commitment 
(June 30), but advocates the withdrawal of Spanish forces 
after that date unless the UN is in control of peacekeeping. 
While the PSOE states a desire for a constructive 
transatlantic alliance with the US, it stresses the primacy 
of Spain,s relationship with the European Union.  The PSOE 
pledges to maintain full Spanish cooperation in the War on 
Terrorism.  The PSOE also proposes to increase social 
programs without raising taxes. 
 
12.  (U)  WHAT IS THE POPULATION OF SPAIN IN RELATION TO THE 
NUMBER OF ELIGIBILE PARTIES? 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Population:  42,717,064 
Number of eligible voters**:  34,403,965 
 
Note 
**Voters do not need to be registered to vote in Spain.  The 
only requirements are that the voter be over 18 years of age, 
listed on the census, and a Spanish citizen.  Permanent 
residents and some other non-citizens are allowed to vote in 
municipal elections, but not in national or regional 
elections. 
 
13.  (U)  HOW ARE MEMBERS ELECTED TO THE SPANISH SENATE? 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
-- There are 208 directly elected seats: 
           - Each of the 47 peninsular provinces is assigned 
4 seats = 188 seats 
     - The larger Balears and Canarias (3 islands) are 
assigned 3 seats each = 9 seats 
     - The smaller islands (seven) are assigned one seat each 
= 7 seats 
     - Ceuta & Melilla are assigned two seats each = 4 seats 
 
-- The legislative assemblies of the regional governments 
(Autonomous Communities) are also assigned one seat each and 
one seat for every million inhabitants.  These positions are 
appointed by the regional government assemblies and are not 
involved in the electoral process. 
 
-- Voters select specific candidates for the Senate, as it 
uses an \"open\" list of candidates.  Voters have three votes 
for the four seats allocated to the province, and can cast 
all three for a single candidate or split their votes as they 
choose among different parties. 
 
-- The Senate in the Spanish system is by far the weaker of 
the two houses. 
 
14.  (SBU)  WHAT\'S THE LIKELY OUTCOME IN THE REGIONAL 
ELECTIONS IN ANDALUCIA? 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Andalucia has been a PSOE stronghold, and polls indicate that 
they are close to an absolute majority and should be able to 
form a government in coalition with smaller parties.

1.  (C) Poloff queried Guillermo Kirkpatrick, the Foreign 
Ministry\'s Deputy Director General for Disarmament, about 
Minister Palacio\'s February 19 meeting with IAEA Director 
General ElBaradei in Vienna.  Kirkpatrick said ElBaradei told 
Palacio he was extremely happy with Libya\'s cooperation with 
the IAEA.  ElBaradei said it would be difficult for Libya to 
be more cooperative. 
 
2.  (C) The situation with Iran was more worrisome. 
ElBaradei wants to proceed slowly and cautiously with Iran, 
so Iran does not feel threatened and turn into another North 
Korea.  He emphasized that where Libya has \"locked up\" and 
made available for inspection its nuclear program equipment, 
Iran has only suspended its enrichment activities.  Iran\'s 
nuclear program is far more developed than Libya\'s and could 
be restarted at any moment.  It will be important, said 
ElBaradei, not to provoke Iran, but rather to coax it into 
cooperating with the international community and eventually 
abandoning its program.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, ECON, SP 
SUBJECT: IPR Crimes: The Impact of Spain\'s Penal Code Reform 
 
 
1. Summary.  On November 25, 2003, the Government of Spain 
modified its Penal Code to reinforce intellectual and 
industrial property protection.  The revised Spanish Penal 
Code increases the punishments for crimes against 
intellectual property and copyright infringements, 
especially for repeat offenders.  It will enter into force 
on October 1, 2004.  End Summary. 
 
2. Organic Law 15/2003 of November 25, 2003 modifies Organic 
Law 10/1995 of the Penal Code.  While the reform affects a 
wide range of crimes and penalties, for the purpose of this 
cable we are focusing only on Penal Code changes to 
intellectual property (IP) crimes.  Overall, the reform 
modifies the penalties to take into account current social 
trends, including high unemployment, increased internet 
piracy, and the use of minors and immigrants to commit IP 
crimes. 
 
3. The highlights of the new Penal Code are as follows: 
 
A) Sentences will be harsher.  Persons convicted of piracy 
can be now given jail sentences between six months and two 
years in addition to \"penalties\" which include probation 
ranging from one to two years.  Time served will be 
cumulative. 
 
B) The production, introduction, importation, possession or 
distribution of computer programs or any other tool 
specifically dedicated to counterfeiting copyrighted 
property will be considered a crime. 
 
C) Police will be allowed to seize pirated products and the 
instruments and assets used to commit the offense, in 
addition to the ill-gotten gains from their illegal sale. 
 
D) Facilitating or supplying illegal access to cable or pay- 
TV (or other electronic media) can be punished by jail 
sentences of six months to two years. 
 
E) Penalties will be stiffer if organized crime plays a role 
in the IP crime or if minors under 18 years old are 
involved.  This is an attempt to more effectively fight the 
mafias that control this lucrative business, the majority of 
whose members are foreigners, and to protect minors who have 
in the past been used as a front for these groups. 
 
F) Whereas the 1995 Penal Code required that a victim or 
aggrieved party (in the case of piracy, the copyright 
holder) notify police about a crime being committed, now the 
police can pursue IP criminals without such notification -- 
an important step forward in combating elusive street 
sellers of pirated goods, known here as \"manteros.\"

2. (C) We delivered reftel demarche to Inigo de Palacio, MFA 
Director of UN Affairs, on February 24.  De Palacio stated 
that while Spain and the EU would support renewing Israel\'s 
WEOG New York membership in May, the EU\'s common policy is to 
\"give a flat no\" to granting Israel full WEOG privileges. 
According to De Palacio, Europe agreed to WEOG New York 
membership for Israel because the New York forum does not 
involve political coordination.  He added that the GOS \"does 
not want to have to discuss political issues with Israel in 
Geneva\", as he believes Israel disregards the decisions that 
the UNHRC passes on Israeli matters.  Furthermore, De Palacio 
stated that Israel does not belong in WEOG, and that Europe 
only allowed their inclusion in WEOG New York to be fair to 
Israel since the Israelis were excluded from the Asia group. 
 
3. (C) De Palacio claimed that limited WEOG membership for 
Israel had explicitly been a condition when Europe agreed to 
their temporary inclusion.  Regarding the reftel talking 
point that mentions that Australia and New Zealand were not 
members of WEOG Nairobi, De Palacio said he was surprised, as 
he believes that Australia and New Zealand are full members 
of all WEOG venues.  He asked for Washington\'s reasoning 
behind that claim.

are not members of WEOG Nairobi, Post requests background on

2. On February 16, 2004, the Spanish Official Gazette (the 
equivalent of the Federal Register) published a list of new 
biotech corn varieties that can now be planted in Spain. 
The nine new varieties approved by the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Food and Fish (MAFF) are: 
 
-- Genetic modification CG 00256-176 
     19970357 SANSONE BT 
     19970348 ESCOBAR 
 
-- Genetic modification MON 810 
     20000398 CAMPERO 
     20000421 CUARTAL BT 
     20000387 DKC 6550 
     19970303 GAMBIER BT 
     20000384 JARAL 
     19980499 PR32P76 
     19980528 PROTECT 
 
3. The Spanish government first approved the commercial 
cultivation of one GM corn variety, 00256-176 in 1998. 
Later, in 2003, the MAFF decided to approve five more Bt 
varieties, four with MON810 and one with CG176.  The GOS 
originally limited GMO planting surface to 25,000 hectares, 
but raised the level in 2003 to 50,000 hectares.  In 2003, 
the total Spanish farmland planted with GM corn was 32,000 
hectares.  With the nine new varieties, the expectation is 
that the GM corn acreage will increase this year. 
 
4. The MAFF order requires that the seed packages of the 
newly approved corn varieties be labeled: \"genetically 
modified variety.\"  The order also says that sales catalog 
descriptions of the newly approved corn varieties must state 
that the varieties are genetically modified and that such 
modification protects them from the corn borer.  For 
varieties containing the CG 00256-176 modification, it must 
also say that they have increased tolerance to the herbicide 
ammonium gluphosinate. 
 
5. The order contains an annex requiring that all purchasers 
of such seeds participate in a tracking plan.  The annex has 
several main points: 
 
-- Seed suppliers must create a tracking plan to last at 
least five years, and they must present that to the MAFF 
within the next two months.  (The industry has already held 
discussions with the MAFF over the past months.) 
 
-- Seed suppliers must report annually to the MAFF and the 
newly-created GMO Interministerial Council the seed sales of 
each variety by location including a purchaser list. 
 
-- Tracking plans must contain, among other factors, an 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the insecticide character 
introduced in the varieties, and a study of possible 
resistance in the borer population. 
 
-- In the case of some insect resistance, farmers are 
required to inform the GMO Interministerial Council as well 
as the newly-created National Committee of Bio-vigilance and 
the competent agency of their regional government.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 02/21/2014 
TAGS: PTER, PREL, SP, Spanish Election March 2004 
SUBJECT: SPANISH ELECTIONS: CONCERNS ABOUT AN ETA ATTACK 
 
Classified By: Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Polcouns, per 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Spanish police are concerned that ETA may strike in 
the period before the March 14 national elections.    Juan 
Hidalgo, Senior Advisor to the State Secretary for Security, 
told us February 26 that ETA\'s recent announcement of a 
\"cease-fire\" in Catalonia meant that it might seek to strike 
elsewhere in Spain during the electoral campaign to show that 
the Catalonia cease-fire matters.    Senior Popular Party 
(PP) contacts, including an official from the Ministry of 
Public Administration and a campaign strategist, expressed 
similar concerns.   They said that ETA seeks to inject itself 
into electoral campaign and would like to strike to show that 
it is still operational. 
 
2.  (C) Hidalgo confirmed that ETA is in poor operational 
shape.  The arrests of 126 ETA members and collaborators in 
Spain in 2003, combined with dozens of high level arrests in 
France had dealt major blows.   Members of ETA\'s operation 
terrorist cells now have an active period of only months 
before they are caught, Hidalgo said.    This is causing 
consternation in ETA\'s ranks.   Hidalgo said that unlike in 
the past, new ETA recruits are often little more than street 
criminals, who are prone to mistakes.    Despite all this, 
Hidalgo underlined that ETA still maintains the capacity to 
strike.    It only takes one functioning cell to plant bombs 
or conduct an assassination.   Hidalgo said police had been 
able to foil attacks, such as suitcase bombs on Spanish 
trains on December 24, which might have proven very bloody ) 
but this could not go on indefinitely. 
 
3.  (C) Hidalgo spends considerable time coordinating ETA 
matters with French police.  He confirmed that cooperation 
with the French is at a high level.    This cooperation had 
been improving steadily since the mid 1990s and has gotten 
better since 9-11.   Hidalgo confirmed that that Mikel Antza 
and Josu Ternera (fugitive Batasuna member of Basque regional 
parliament) are the political heads of ETA.    He said there 
are differing views on who the overall ETA \"military command\" 
leader is.   It is difficult to know for sure, he said, given 
the arrests over the past year in France of top operational 
leaders.   Hidalgo could not confirm that it was Antza and 
Ternera (rather than other ETA reps) who met with Catalan 
nationalist ERC leader Carod-Rovira in early January in 
France, as has been widely reported. 
 
4.  (C) Hidalgo did not believe that ETA, as its operational 
capacities decline further, would opt for ever bloodier and 
more indiscriminate attacks (as some predict).   Hidalgo felt 
that with over 500 ETA prisoners in Spanish jails, ETA would 
want to keep the possibility open of, under terms of 
surrender, getting GOS agreement to move ETA prisoners to 
prisons in the Basque region so they could be near their 
families.  (The ETA prisoners are currently scattered 
throughout Spain as a security measure). 
 
5.  (C) Comment: The Popular Party and its candidate, Mariano 
Rajoy (a former Interior Minister), have made GOS success in 
the fight against ETA a central issue.   An ETA attack, even 
a serious one, however, would not necessarily harm Rajoy and 
the PP in the elections, as it could underscore the need for 
a continued firm hand against ETA.  ETA\'s primary goal, 
rather than influencing the election outcome, would appear to 
be to use an attack during the high-profile finale of the 
national election to demonstrate that, despite the police

1. (SBU) We shared reftel letter and points with GOS contacts 
in Moncloa (the Spanish equivalent of the White House) and 
the Ministries of Economy and Foreign Affairs.   Nicolas 
Lopez, Spain\'s 133 Committee titular, told us that while 
reconsideration of the March 1 retaliation is not possible, 
Spain and most other member states are inclined to view U.S. 
progress towards a legislative solution favorably.  Lopez 
said member states feel that the March 1 retaliation will 
clearly convey the EU\'s interest in having the Foreign Sales 
Corporation (FSC) law repealed soon.  He said he did not 
expect that the initial 5% tariff will have strong impact on 
U.S. exports given the current euro/dollar exchange rate, 
however he warned that given the monthly rate increase, it 
would not be wise to delay for long. 
 
2. (SBU) Lopez said that member states have not formally 
discussed the three-year transition period.  However, on the 
margins of 133 Committee meetings, most members have said 
\"more than three years would not be acceptable.\"  He added 
that Spain and most other member states would like to see the 
retaliation go away.  He said if the U.S. legislation is 
reasonable, the EU will be likewise be reasonable in its 
response.

SUBJECT: SUBJECT: SPANISH ELECTIONS: MAJOR ETA ATTACK ON 
MADRID FOILED 
 
REF: MADRID 679 
 
1.  Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
2. (U) The Guardia Civil arrested two ETA members in the 
pre-dawn of February 29 on a highway about a hundred miles 
east of Madrid.   One of the ETA operatives was in a van 
carrying over 500 kg of explosives; the other was in a 
lookout car.   They entered Spain from France via Huesca. 
Interior Minister Acebes reports that their target was 
Madrid.  Police estimate that detonation of the explosives 
would have left a crater 35 meters in diameter and that 
anyone within 60 meters of the explosion would have been 
killed.   It was the second largest Spanish police 
interception of explosives in the 35-year battle against ETA. 
 
 
3. (SBU) As reported reftel, Police contacts had indicated to 
us their concerns that ETA would attack during the election 
campaign (which officially began February 27).   Police 
believe ETA seeks to demonstrate that it still is operational 
and wants to back up its self-declared \"cease-fire\" for 
Catalonia by striking elsewhere in Spain.   Police remain on 
high alert to guard against other possible attacks prior to 
the March 14 general elections.   The two arrested ETA 
members were reportedly on their first mission.    This 
conforms with Spanish police analysis that ETA operational 
cell members are increasingly inexperienced and prone to 
error. 
4. (SBU) The February 29 arrests follow on the December 24 
police pre-emption of another ETA bombing.  In that instance, 
two ETA members placed backpacks with 25 kg of explosives 
each on a train going to Madrid from Irun (Basque region). 
The explosives were timed to explode once the train arrived 
at the station in Madrid.  Police uncovered the bombs soon 
after they were placed.  Some analysts note that the averted 
truck bomb and the averted bombing of the Madrid train 
station indicate that ETA, as it declines, may be moving into 
a phase of more indiscriminate attacks.    In both occasions, 
ETA sought high profile periods, Christmas Eve or the 
national election campaign, for maximum publicity impact. 
 
5.  (SBU) Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy used the 
incident to demonstrate the success of the PP government\'s 
antiterrorism strategy, which has resulted in hundreds of 
arrests and the significant disruption of the ETA 
organization.  The core of the GOS strategy is the need to go 
after the entire ETA infrastructure: financing, logistics, 
political support, and recruiting and not just the 
operational cells.    Rajoy reiterated February 29 that 
defeating ETA would be his number one priority as President 
of the Government (as it has been for Aznar). 
 
6.  (U) Interior Minister Acebes used the arrests to draw 
attention to the Socialists\' pact with the pro-independence 
ERC party in Catalonia.   Acebes said that ERC leader 
Carod-Rovira -- who met with ETA leaders in January -- must 
be \"very satisfied\" that Madrid was the intended target, not 
Catalonia.   Socialist leader Rodriguez Zapatero, and various 
media, strongly criticized Acebes and the PP for politicizing 
the fight against ETA. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  Although foiled in this case, ETA has 
demonstrated that despite the many arrests and pressures it 
has suffered, it is still operational (albeit at a much lower 
level than previously).   Like a wounded animal, ETA appears 
determined to lash out -- and would like nothing better than 
to do so during the current election campaign.

Spain - 2004 Trafficking in Persons Report Responses 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
18. OVERVIEW 
 
A.  Spain is a destination and transit country for trafficked 
persons.  Information on trafficking in persons comes from 
the Ministry of Interior (which includes the Civil Guard and 
National Police) and an NGO contracted by the government to 
provide victims assistance, Project Hope (Proyecto 
Esperanza).  All sources are generally reliable. The Spanish 
National Police (SNP) reports that 1,527 victims of 
trafficking in persons were liberated in 2003.  The majority 
were victims of sexual exploitation.  Sexual trafficking in 
Spain almost exclusively involves women victims, with no 
identifiable reports of male victims and only one reported 
case of a minor under 17 years of age.  Project Hope reports 
that victims they assisted were in the following age ranges: 
under 17 yrs - 1%; between 18 and 25 yrs - 70%; between 26 
and 30 - 22%; older than 30 yrs - 4%; unknown age - 3%. 
According to a victim\'s profile study by the Spanish National 
Police, persons most at risk of being trafficked are young 
women with low education and few economic resources, with the 
majority (77%) coming from five countries: Romania, Russia, 
Brazil, Colombia and Nigeria.  Trafficking does occur inside 
the country\'s borders.  There are no areas of Spain that are 
outside of government control. 
 
B.  Trafficked victims arrive from three major regions: 
Eastern Europe (Romania, Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine), Latin 
America (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador), and sub-Saharan Africa 
(Nigeria, Guinea Conakry).  Trafficking in Asians, normally 
Chinese, is much less frequent, and is divided between those 
brought to Spain for work in sweatshops and service 
industries and those transiting to the U.S. and Canada. 
Spain is a destination point for the majority of persons 
trafficked, especially those from Latin America and Eastern 
Europe.  Some African groups use Spain as a transit country 
for travel to France and Germany. 
 
C. Overall numbers of victims of sexual exploitation and the 
number of arrests for trafficking remained comparable to the 
prior period.  Of the five major countries of origin, the 
only significant change was in the number of victims from 
Brazil, which doubled from the prior year. 
 
D. The SNP maintains a special unit, the Immigration Networks 
and Falsified Documents Unit (UCRIF), that deals with 
trafficking in persons, and the UCRIF Intelligence Unit 
analyzes trends and statistics year-round.  UCRIF also 
coordinates efforts and shares data on trafficking with the 
Civil Guard and Interpol.  Regional SNP offices conduct 
reviews every three months to set goals in combating 
trafficking and to assess success in meeting goals from the 
prior period.  The regional units receive financial benefits 
from the Ministry of Interior for meeting their goals.  Data 
available this year, which was not existent last year, 
includes a comprehensive report from the UCRIF Intelligence 
Unit, which includes 2003 arrest statistics, victims 
statistics, victim profile, legal codes used in prosecuting 
trafficking, information on cooperative efforts and 
inter-ministerial programs, and maps of major routes used by 
international trafficking rings for trafficking into Spain. 
Development of this comprehensive assessment on the nature 
and extent of trafficking in and through Spain was a specific 
goal set by G/TIP for the Spanish government.  Also available 
this year was a November 2003 report from the University of 
Deusto on trafficking in persons in Spain. 
 
E. Victims are trafficked into Spain for both sexual 
exploitation (most frequently involving prostitution and work 
in nude dancing and alternative clubs) and labor exploitation 
(primarily agricultural, construction, and domestic 
employment).  Methods used by traffickers to maintain control 
of their victims include physical abuse, forced use of drugs, 
withholding of travel documents, and threats to the victim\'s 
family. 
 
F.  Spain is generally not a country of origin for 
trafficking. 
 
G.  There is political will at the highest levels to combat 
trafficking and the government makes a good faith effort to 
seriously address trafficking.  The second-ranking official 
in the Ministry of Interior coordinates anti-trafficking 
efforts.  Anti-trafficking efforts also receive support from 
the Office of the President, Ministry of Labor and Social 
Services, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of 
Education.  There were no instances reported of government 
officials involved in trafficking.  Though government 
corruption is not a problem in Spain, isolated instances of 
official misconduct have been aggressively prosecuted in the 
past.  No cases of government corruption were reported this 
year.  The government commits resources from the Civil Guard 
and police authorities to control borders and investigate 
trafficking activities, and commits resources from the 
Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Services to prosecute violators, inspect workplaces, and 
assist victims.  The government also funds NGO groups who 
provide assistance to victims. 
 
H. There were no instances of government officials 
facilitating or condoning trafficking, taking bribes, or in 
any way assisting in trafficking operations. 
 
I. Willingness of victims to press charges remains the main 
limitation in combating trafficking.  This is despite Spanish 
provisions for witness protection and availability of visas 
for those who testify against trafficking rings.  No 
limitations exist in funding for police or other governmental 
institutions, nor was corruption a problem.  Project Hope, 
the principal NGO contracted for victim assistance, reports 
that current year funding from the government was increased, 
and that they have no funding limitations for their programs. 
 
J. The National Police\'s UCRIF Intelligence Unit maintains 
ongoing monitoring of trafficking trends, and statistics. 
Regional SNP units review their anti-trafficking efforts 
every three months and receive financial benefits for 
achieving goals.  The SNP and Civil Guard participate in 
ongoing coordination and data-sharing with the Interpol and 
Europol, and the Ministry of Interior coordinates and 
evaluates anti-trafficking efforts inside the Spanish 
government.  Information on anti-trafficking efforts, 
statistics and trends are available publicly through the SNP 
and Civil Guard. 
 
K. Prostitution, in itself, is decriminalized in Spain. 
However, as of September 30, 2003, it is illegal for anyone 
to profit from prostitution other than the actual prostitute. 
 This law makes it illegal for pimps or brothels to receive 
money from the prostitute\'s activities, even if the 
prostitute consents to it.  Also, as part of a joint City of 
Madrid and Ministry of Labor and Social Services 
anti-prostitution educational campaign launched in January 
2004, the Madrid city government announced it was studying a 
system of fines and jail sentences for clients of 
prostitution, using the Swedish system as an example. 
Spanish law prohibits involvement of minors in prostitution 
(under age 18), and prohibits activities associated with 
trafficking in persons, including the use of force, violence, 
threats or fraud for sexual exploitation.  Prison sentences 
for the latter offenses are specified as 5 to 10 years, with 
12 to 15 year sentences possible for aggravating 
circumstances.  These sentences are higher than the previous 
year, as in September 2003 the Spanish Senate passed a 
tougher anti-trafficking law.  Passage of this law was one of 
the specific goals set out in G/TIP\'s objectives for Spain. 
 
 
L. There were no reports of the buying or selling of child 
brides in Spain. 
 
 
19. PREVENTION 
 
A. The government acknowledges that trafficking is a problem 
and takes measures to address the problem. 
 
B. Spain commits resources of the Ministry of Interior (SNP 
and Civil Guard), Ministry of Labor and Social Services, 
Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Education, Ministry of 
Culture and Sports, Ministry of Public Administration, and 
the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs.  Spain also 
funds several NGO groups that provide assistance to victims 
of trafficking. 
 
C. Spain sponsors programs to educate women victims of 
violence about social services and to encourage women to 
report instances to the police and to press charges.  Project 
Hope reports that 89% of women that they assist now press 
criminal charges, a rate which is much higher than that 
associated with victims of labor exploitation, which remains 
minimal.  In January, the Madrid city government, in 
conjunction with the Ministry of Labor and Social Services, 
announced the beginning of an anti-prostitution and 
anti-trafficking in women education campaign that will target 
the clients of prostitutes. 
 
D. The government supports programs to increase employment 
opportunities for women.  NGOs funded by the government 
provide work training and job placement services for women 
liberated from trafficking rings to give them an alternative 
to returning to prostitution. 
 
E. Governmental agencies and victim assistance NGOs report 
that funding resources are sufficient to operate their 
programs. 
 
F. NGO representatives report that they have good and open 
relationships with governmental agencies and officials. 
Project Hope reports that it cooperates well with the Spanish 
National Police, is actively informed of victims of 
trafficking, and is included in trafficking in persons 
training programs for recruits at the SNP\'s academy in Avila. 
 
G. The government adequately monitors its borders, especially 
committing resources to the Civil Guard to patrol its sea 
borders, where illegal immigration is particularly dangerous 
due to hazardous crossings of open ocean and Straights of 
Gibraltar sea-lanes.  The SNP and Civil Guard both monitor 
immigration patterns for evidence of trafficking.  Both 
agencies respond appropriately to evidence, with cooperation 
between the Civil Guard and Embassy DHS Immigration Service 
personnel being especially good. 
 
H. The Ministry of Interior coordinates anti-trafficking 
efforts and maintains workgroups for the coordination of SNP 
and Civil Guard activities.  Both the SNP and the Civil Guard 
also participate in coordination and data sharing workgroups 
with Interpol and Europol.  Public sector corruption is not 
generally a problem in Spain, and anti-corruption 
investigations would be processed through normal law 
enforcement and judicial agencies. 
 
I. The government coordinates the anti-trafficking activity 
of its law enforcement agencies with Interpol, Europol, and 
EU illegal-immigration working groups.  Spain also has 
cooperative agreements with many North African and 
Sub-Saharan African nations.  Spain has provided 
French-language training to high-level SNP officials to aid 
in cooperation with countries in French-speaking Africa.  The 
SNP has actively sought Embassy, RSO, and FBI Legal Attach 
assistance in finding contacts in African nations to share 
intelligence related to trafficking-in-persons and 
illegal-immigration routes and criminal organizations in 
sub-Saharan Africa.  Spain participates in EU and Schengen 
Group cooperative efforts to combat trafficking from Eastern 
Europe, particularly with those countries set to join the EU 
in May.  Increasing bilateral cooperation with source 
countries was a specific goal in G/TIP objectives for Spain, 
and the increased focus on countries of origin is evident. 
Of special note, in response to requests by G/TIP in the 
summer of 2003, officials of both the SNP and Civil Guard 
offered their assistance to specifically investigate a report 
of isolated instances of trafficking in persons originating 
from Latvia.  Embassy also transmitted these offers of 
assistance. 
 
J. The government has a National Immigration Plan that 
addresses combating illegal immigration into Spain, which is 
a major component in preventing trafficking.  The Ministry of 
Interior coordinates anti-trafficking efforts within 
workgroups involving its law enforcement agencies, the 
Ministry of Labor and Social Services, the Ministry of 
Justice, Interpol, Europol, and NGOs responsible for victim 
assistance.  NGOs report that the government consults with 
them in coordinating programs, and the principle NGO, Project 
Hope, is included in anti-trafficking training for law 
enforcement officers.  Plans, analyses, and statistics are 
available through the SNP and Civil Guard. 
 
K. The Ministry of Interior takes the lead in directing 
anti-trafficking efforts. 
 
20. INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS 
 
A. Spain has specific laws to prohibit trafficking in persons 
and other activities related to sexual and labor 
exploitation.  These laws are applied in practice and are 
adequate to cover the full scope of trafficking in persons. 
The law prohibits trafficking in persons from, through, or to 
Spain.  The law also prohibits trafficking in workers; sexual 
exploitation involving violence, intimidation or fraud; the 
sexual exploitation of minors, including use for prostitution 
or pornography; forging or certifying false government 
documents; and illicit association with trafficking in 
persons networks.  The Organic Law for Specific Measures 
Related to Citizen Security, Domestic Violence and the Social 
Integration of Foreigners was passed by the Spanish Senate in 
September 2003.  This section of the Organic Law increased 
the penalties for trafficking in persons (from 2 to 4 years 
previously, to the current 5 to 10 years) and other 
activities related to trafficking, such as trafficking for 
sexual exploitation, the use of threats, violence or fraud, 
the involvement of minors, or the placing of the victim\'s 
life in danger (these latter offences increasing the penalty 
to 6 to 12 years).  Passage of this law was a specific goal 
for Spain in the country objectives set by G/TIP last summer. 
 
B. The penalty for trafficking in persons for sexual 
exploitation is 5 to 10 years in prison, increasing to 6 to 
12 years if aggravating circumstances are present.  The 
penalty for trafficking in persons for labor exploitation is 
2 to 5 years and a fine. 
 
C. The penalty for rape is 6 to 12 years in prison, 
increasing to a possible 15 years with aggravating 
circumstances.  The penalty for sexual assault is 1 to 4 
years in prison, increasing to 4 to 10 years with aggravating 
circumstances. 
 
D. The SNP reports a total of 677 trafficking networks 
dismantled, with 2,028 responsible individuals arrested in 
2003.  Sentencing guidelines call for 5 to 10 years in 
prison, with an increase to 6 to 12 years with aggravating 
circumstances.  Detailed data of individual sentences are 
recorded at the local and regional jurisdiction levels, and 
the Spanish General Council of the Judiciary is tabulating 
these records to provide the Embassy statistics on sentencing 
for trafficking crimes.  This effort should be completed 
shortly.  The Embassy\'s Locally Employed Staff lawyer in the 
Consular Section conducted a sampling of individual 
sentencing records that are available on an Internet site for 
Spanish legal professionals.  All records sampled were 
covered by the pre-September 2003 sentencing guidelines of 2 
to 4 years, and showed an average sentence of three years for 
trafficking offences.  Once sentenced, Spanish prisoners must 
generally serve 75% of their sentences before being eligible 
for parole. 
 
E. Trafficking into Spain is generally controlled by 
organized criminal gangs, who are especially prevalent in 
trafficking for sexual exploitation.  The largest such groups 
are Romanian criminal organizations that traffic prostitutes, 
often luring victims with false offers of employment. 
Victims and the criminal organizations that traffic them are 
generally of the same nationality.  There were no reports of 
involvement by Spanish government officials, and government 
corruption is not a problem in Spain.  Profits from 
trafficking both stay with the traffickers in Spain and are 
channeled back to associates of the same criminal 
organization in the country of origin. 
 
F. The government actively investigates cases of trafficking. 
 Law enforcement agencies are permitted by law, and use in 
practice, active investigative techniques such as phone taps, 
undercover operations and surveillance activities. 
 
G. The government provides specialized 
anti-trafficking-in-persons training to law enforcement 
agencies.  Training is provided to recruits at the Spanish 
National Police Academy in Avila, and is also mandatory for 
candidates for promotion to the inspector level.  The NGO 
Project Hope has been involved in teaching courses on 
trafficking in persons and victims assistance at the SNP 
Academy. 
 
H. Spain cooperates with several countries of origin, as well 
as with the EU, Interpol and Europol, to investigate 
trafficking cases.  The SNP reports that in 2003, they 
cooperated in investigations in countries of origin that 
resulted in the arrests of 303 individuals and the 
dismantling of 194 organized trafficking networks. 
 
I. The government can extradite persons charged with 
trafficking, including its own nationals.  Spanish officials 
identified seven extraditions for trafficking-related 
offences this period (three Romanians, and one each from 
Lithuania, Albania, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic). 
 
J. There is no evidence of government involvement in 
trafficking or tolerance of trafficking at any level of the 
government. 
 
K.  There were no cases of government officials involved with 
trafficking in persons this period. 
 
L. The government has ratified all of the mentioned 
instruments. Dates of ratification are: 
ILO Convention 182 - April 2, 2001 
ILO Convention 29 - August 29, 1932 
ILO Convention 105 - November 6, 1967 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child - December 18, 2001 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children - March 1, 2002 
 
21. PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS 
 
A. The government provides assistance to trafficking victims. 
 Medical attention is provided through the national health 
care system.  The government funds various NGOs to provide 
shelter, counseling and psychological assistance, legal 
assistance, job training, placement and reinsertion services, 
and assistance in obtaining visas that are available for 
victims who testify against traffickers.  The primary 
assistance NGO, Project Hope, reports that financing by the 
government was increased this year and that its funding is 
sufficient to implement their programs.  Providing additional 
support for comprehensive victims assistance services was a 
specific goal set in the G/TIP objectives for Spain last 
summer. With increased funding this year, Project Hope 
reports that problems with providing victims services at peak 
volumes, which had been a problem in previous years, has been 
resolved for this 2003-2004 period.  HIV/AIDS tests are 
provided to trafficking victims.  Project Hope reports that 
there is a low percentage of positive tests. 
 
B. The government funds NGOs to provide the majority of 
victim assistance services.  NGOs submit annual proposals for 
services to the government and receive yearly grants to fund 
those proposals. 
 
C. Trafficking victims are referred directly from the SNP and 
Civil Guard to Project Hope, or other NGOs in areas not 
served by Project Hope. 
 
D. Trafficking victims who agree to cooperate in the 
prosecution of traffickers receive special treatment and are 
processed separately from the criminal population.  Those who 
fulfill promises to testify are eligible for visas to stay in 
Spain, and the victim assistance NGOs aid those individuals 
in applying for visas.  Those victims who choose not to 
cooperate are repatriated, which must legally occur within 40 
days.  Project Hope provides those waiting for repatriation 
with all their normal services, except for the visa 
application aid.  Victims who testify do not face prosecution 
for prostitution, and can have their immigration status 
normalized by means of the previously described visas. 
 
E. The government actively encourages victims to assist in 
the investigation and prosecution of traffickers.  Victims 
may seek legal action against traffickers and receive 
restitution from them, though this process is combined with 
the criminal prosecution, not in a separate civil suit as in 
the United States.  Government-funded NGOs provide legal 
assistance to victims and no impediments to access to legal 
redress were reported.  Victims testifying against an 
employer may seek visas that allow for employment in Spain. 
There is a victims restitution program. 
F. The government may provide witness protection in the form 
of allowing witnesses to remain anonymous, detailing police 
escorts and providing economic assistance.  The government 
provides these protections in practice to victims the 
presiding judge determines to be at risk. 
 
G. The government provides specialized training (in both 
recognition of trafficking and in victim assistance) to law 
enforcement officers at the academy recruit level, and again 
for candidates for promotion to inspector.  Project Hope is 
involved in the recruit training, which is held at the SNP 
Academy in Avila.  The chief and deputy-chief of the SNP\'s 
UCRIF Unit have been involved in the training for the 
inspector candidates.  Spain provides financial and 
repatriation assistance to its citizens at its embassies and 
consulates; however, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\' 
Consular Division reports that they have never received 
reports of Spaniards becoming victims of trafficking rings 
overseas.  Spain is almost exclusively a destination country 
for trafficking.  The SNP does consult with Spanish embassies 
and consulates on trafficking in persons investigations. 
 
H.  The government provides for medical assistance, economic 
assistance and repatriation for its citizens through Spanish 
embassies and consulates, however, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs says it is not aware of Spanish citizens becoming 
victims of trafficking. 
 
I.  NGOs are funded by the government to provide victims 
assistance, including shelter, legal aid, counseling and 
psychological assistance, and job training, placement and 
reinsertion services.  NGOs funded include Project Hope, the 
Association for Attention, Prevention and Reinsertion of 
Women Prostitutes (APRAMP), the Voluntary Association of 
Dominican Mothers (VOMADE), Association for Cooperation in 
the South-the Segovias (ACSUR), Association of Raped Women, 
General Association in Defense of the Rights of Prostitutes 
(HETAIRA), Villa Teresita Safe House, CARITAS, the Red Cross, 
and Hermanos Oblatas.  The main NGO contractor, Project Hope, 
reports that the NGOs cooperate fully with both the SNP and 
the Civil Guard.

In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. 
In the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program

1. SUMMARY: Despite the strong political will of government 
officials and the stepped up enforcement efforts of police, 
piracy continues to be a significant problem in Spain as 
pirates adapt their way of doing business to avoid police, to 
take advantage of legislative loopholes, and to better use 
the internet.  While illegal software sales have hit a 
plateau and there has been minimal positive movement in the 
percentage of illegal CD sales, pirate DVD sales increased 
slightly.  Enforcement efforts are impressive, with over 5 
million music and sound recordings seized during raids. 
Police were successful in thwarting pirates during the prime 
holiday shopping season.  There was also progress in the 
courts: Nike gained control of its trademark after a 14-year 
legal battle.  The GOS revised its Penal Code to increase 
punishments for IP offenders, and has continued its efforts 
to train judges and provide consumer education on IP issues. 
Spain seems to have faced up to its piracy problem and is 
committed to apply the training and enforcement resources to 
stem the tide.  In light of these efforts and our sense of 
GOS committment to continue the fight, we recommend keeping 
Spain off the 301 watchlist this year.  END SUMMARY 
 
Overall IP Climate 
------------------ 
 
2. MUSIC, VIDEOGAMES AND MOVIES:  Industry and police 
contacts in Spain have told us that over the past year, their 
enforcement actions have yielded some success in deterring 
pirates and reducing street sales of CDs and DVDs. 
Nonetheless, the problem continues to be significant --- 
estimates for CD piracy range between 20% and 30%.  DVD 
piracy is estimated to be much lower.  Moreover, pirates are 
adapting their methods and sales to thwart government and 
industry enforcement efforts.  Sales of pirated CDs continue 
to be handled mostly by illegal immigrants who display their 
pirate CD wares on blankets (\"mantas,\" the sellers are 
therefore called \"manteros\" in Spanish) on city sidewalks in 
shopping districts and in subway stations.  Because police 
have cracked down on manteros, a few would-be manteros are 
now trading in blankets for backpacks to peddle pirate CDs. 
Some manteros and backpack sellers also carry DVDs.  Fewer 
still sell videogames.  More sophisticated pirates have moved 
on-line.  Internet  peer-to-peer networks are also on the 
rise.  Industry representatives in Madrid have told us that 
street sales now concern them much less than the rise of 
internet piracy sales and illegal downloads. 
 
3. SOFTWARE: Illegal software sales in Spain seem to have 
leveled off at about 49%.  While this is a definite 
improvement over the 74% figure of 1995, there is still much 
work to be done.  The Business Software Alliance (BSA) works 
with the GOS to increase awareness in small businesses (the 
main users of illegal software).  In addition, police have 
been active in trying to combat retail sales of illegal 
software. 
 
4. TRADEMARK ISSUES: In February 2004, after more than 14 
years of court battles, Nike won a major victory in the 
Spanish Constitutional Court that once again allows the 
company to use its trademark (both the name and the swoosh) 
on apparel sold in Spain.  In response to Nike\'s appeal of a 
negative 1999 Supreme Court ruling, the Spanish 
Constitutional Court sided with Nike, annulling the other 
court\'s decision.  It returned the decision to the Supreme 
Court asking that it revise its decision based on the 
findings of Constitutional Court justices.  Nike is hoping 
that the new Supreme Court ruling, expected to be issued 
within the next 12 months, will be fair and objective. 
 
5. PHARMACEUTICAL PATENTS: Spain\'s pharmaceutical patent 
problem is a legacy of its old process patent law which was 
in effect until October 1992.  From that point on, all 
pharmaceutical patents granted have been product patents. 
Pharmaceutical companies complain that non-innovative 
producers are able to easily obtain permission to produce 
\"legal copies\" of their process patented drugs if they make 
minor changes in the production process.  Like other 
countries that have a recent history of process patents, this 
is a problem that only time will solve.  For the next eight 
years the legacy of the old patent system will continue to 
irk pharmaceutical companies, but until all process patents 
are expired, we do not anticipate a significant change in the 
situation. 
 
6. POLICE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS: Police focus on and action 
against IP offenses, most notably pirated CDs, have increased 
over the past year.  Combined total raids for national 
police, Guardia Civil and municipal police against music, 
videogame, and movie pirates and sellers exceed 10,000 in 
2003.  Over 5 million movie and sound recordings were seized. 
 Police are frustrated that legislative loopholes, illegal 
immigrant status of some of those apprehended, and uneven and 
slow judicial decisions undermine some of their efforts.  Our 
police contacts believe their effectiveness will be enhanced 
when the revised Penal Code goes into effect later this year 
(see para 8).  In addition to raiding production facilities, 
police are also making headway in getting \"manteros\" off the 
street.  Year 2003 police interventions in Spain\'s piracy 
focal point, Madrid, surpassed double the number witnessed in 
2002.  The Madrid municipal police force added extra officers 
at the end of the year specifically to deter manteros during 
the peak holiday and New Year shopping season.  In Barcelona, 
frequent raids on a market renowned as a center for pirated 
software has reduced by half the sales of pirated programs. 
National police and Guardia Civil are especially equipped and 
increasing their work to combat on-line piracy. 
 
7. EDUCATION EFFORTS: Last year Spain\'s Interministerial 
Anti-Piracy Commission and the Consejo Superior Judicial 
(Spanish administrative body which oversees the courts) 
signed an agreement to train judges on IP issues.  The two 
bodies will collaborate on two training courses, in April and 
October, to train 40 to 45 judges each time.  More 
importantly, the contents of each course will be published 
and distributed to Spanish judges throughout Spain.  The 
Copyright Office at the Ministry of Culture is also working 
on an education campaign targeting children between 12 and 18 
to explain the production process and manpower that goes into 
making copyright products.  The Congreso de los Diputados 
(the lower house of Spanish Parliament) established a 
parliamentary sub-committee to propose actions that should be 
taken to protect IP.  At year-end 2003, the sub-committee 
published a set of recommendations directed at the Spanish 
government bureaucracy, law enforcement agencies, and Spanish 
society as a whole, to send a clear signal of the importance 
of IP protection. 
 
8. PENAL CODE REFORM: On November 25, 2003, the GOS modified 
its Penal Code to reinforce intellectual and industrial 
property protection.  The revised Spanish Penal Code 
increases the punishments for crimes against IP 
infringements, especially for repeat offenders.  It will 
enter into force on October 1, 2004. 
 
Ongoing Areas of Review 
----------------------- 
 
9. OPTICAL MEDIA PIRACY REGULATIONS:  Article 25 of Spain\'s 
IP legislation establishes a tax on optical manufacturing 
equipment; operators are required to apply for licenses. 
There is no legislation requiring that SID (source 
identification) codes be used on locally manufactured CDs. 
Despite this however, 12 out of 13 Spanish compact disc 
manufacturers have signed SID accords with Phillips and IFPI. 
 
10. USE/PROCUREMENT OF GOVERNMENT SOFTWARE:  As previously 
reported, in 2000 the GOS published guidelines entitled \"The 
Intellectual Property of Software Programs.\"  These 
guidelines are for government ministries and outline 
measures, recommendations and good practices for acquiring 
and using software.  The guidelines have been explained in 
workshops and are widely available to Spanish government 
officials, including on the internet. 
 
11. TRIPS COMPLIANCE: The GOS counts itself in complete 
compliance with TRIPS since 1997. 
 
12. ENFORCEMENT: See para 6 above. 
 
13. COMMENT: In our 301 cable last year we reported that the 
Spanish government had finally faced up to the magnitude of 
its piracy problem and was making good faith efforts to 
combat it.  Since then, GOS officials in various ministries 
have continued their work on the issue and the various 
domestic police forces have been exceptional in the quantity 
and scope of their efforts to roll back IP piracy in Spain. 
The passage of the revised Penal Code also bodes well for 
continued progress in the fight against pirates.  Despite all 
of these and other abovementioned efforts, the piracy problem 
in Spain continues to be significant.  It is our judgment 
that Spanish authorities are aware of the problem and have 
the political will to fight it.  But it will take time.  We 
believe Spain should remain off the Special 301 list. 
Spain\'s inclusion on the list will not hasten its progress 
and may only serve to dampen rather than encourage enthusiasm 
to take action as a new government takes the reins in a few 
months.  At present our GOS IP contacts are receptive and 
willing to take our suggestions and listen to our concerns. 
We will continue to work with them and to monitor Spain\'s 
progress and provide assistance and information whenever 
possible -- and place the fight against IP pirates at the top 
of our agenda with the responsible officials in the next 
Spanish government.

TAGS: MOPS, PREL, PGOV, SP, NATO, Defense and Political 
SUBJECT: DASD BRZEZINSKI DISCUSSES NATO NON-FUNDING OF 
SPANISH AIR DEFENSE WITH MOD OFFICIALS 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick for reasons 
1.4 (A), (B) and (D) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for 
European and NATO policy Ian Brzezinski met February 26 with 
Ministry of Defense officials in Madrid to discuss the NATO 
Security Investment Program,s (NSIP) funding of Spanish air 
defense systems and Spain\'s blockage of NATO infrastructure 
projects at both U.S. bases in the CONUS and Aviano Air Base, 
Italy.  The U.S. side rolled out its new &over and above8 
eligibility policy that updates the criteria for providing 
NATO common funding for portions of national air defense 
systems.  The Spanish agreed that this new policy should be 
applied to NATO,s future Air Command and Control System 
(ACCS) but not to the current NATO Integrated Air Defense 
System (NATINADS).  Spain asserted, inaccurately, that NATO 
had approved funding of approximately 50 million euros for 
Spain\'s air defense systems before the \"over and above\" 
policy was put in place.  NATO should therefore fund this 
amount for Spain\'s air defense systems. 
 
2.  (C) DASD Brzezinski replied saying the U.S. greatly 
appreciates Spain\'s contributions as a close ally. 
Nonetheless, the over and above policy was in effect before 
Spain\'s system requirements were submitted for NATO 
consideration and at any rate, the NATO Security Investment 
Program (NSIP) could no longer afford to fund air defense 
systems to the extent Spain wished.  If NATO did so, the NSIP 
would not have funds for higher-priority projects essential 
to NATO Transformation.  Spain agreed to consider an initial 
mutual un-blocking of some NSIP projects as a first step 
toward resolving the impasse, and Brzezinski agreed the U.S. 
would take another look at whether any portions of Spain\'s 
air defense system warranted NATO funding within the over and 
above limitation.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
GOS: Fund Air Defense Retroactively 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Jimenez-Ugarte laid out Spain\'s position:  Spain gets 
only 40 cents for every dollar it contributes to NATO and has 
been proud to be an ally that \"has not made substantial 
financial demands on the Alliance8.  Spain, he said, was 
only asking for NATO to fund 20 percent of its \"NATINADS\" 
radar system, which amounted to approximately 50 million 
euros.  Spain had funded or will fund the remaining 80 
percent.  Spain did not disagree with the U.S.\'s \"over and 
above\" policy, but believed the U.S. decided to apply the 
rule after NATO had already approved Spain\'s radar system. 
The rule should therefore not apply to Spain\'s air defense 
projects.  He said Spain would have a difficult time lifting 
the Aviano blocks if the parties could not reach a compromise 
on Spain\'s air defense system. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
DASD Brzezinski: NATO Cannot Exhaust NSIP Funding on ACCS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
5.  (C) DASD Brzezinski emphasized the U.S. greatly 
appreciates Spain\'s contributions to the War on Terror, in 
the Balkans and in Iraq and is proud that Spain is one of our 
closest allies.  He said, however, that Spain\'s blockage of 
Aviano infrastructure projects in the NSIP was inhibiting 
NATO transformation and was a growing irritant in relations. 
He noted that the \"over and above\" policy was not new and the 
U.S. had long said NATO should only fund air defense systems 
beyond national requirements.  Aside from that, times had 
changed since Spain first requested funding for its air 
defense system in the late 1990s, and  NSIP simply could no 
longer afford to fund members\' air defense systems beyond the 
over and above principle.  If NSIP funded more for air 
defense systems, the budget would hemorrhage as other 
countries would insist on the same treatment. Funding would 
not be available to pay for higher-priority NSIP projects 
such as new satellite communications, missile defense, NATO 
enlargement, Airborne Ground Surveillance, creating 
deployable Combined Joint Task Forces, and implementing the 
new command structure, all of which are estimated to cost 3.5 
billion euros. Responding to Spain\'s concern that it was 
paying more than it was receiving in NATO funds, DASD 
Brzezinski stressed that, over the next five years, Spain 
would be the beneficiary of approximately 800 million euros 
of NATO and U.S. funding destined for infrastructure projects 
supporting ACCS, Rota Naval Base, and the new HQ LANDSOUTH. 
 
------------------------------ 
Steps Toward Resolving Impasse 
------------------------------ 
6.  (C) After further discussion, DASD Brzezinski suggested 
the parties take a first step toward resolving the impasse by 
mutually lifting blocks on relatively small-scale projects: 
The U.S. would lift blocks related to Rota Naval Base and 
several other bases worth about 2.4 million euros, if Spain 
lifted un-blocked projects in the CONUS worth about 2 million 
euros.  Brzezinski also said the U.S. would take another look 
at Spain\'s unfunded air defense projects and the associated 
cost estimates (once Spain provided more detailed, \"Type B\" 
estimates) to determine if the NSIP could fund additional 
sums while still staying within the over and above 
parameters.  The meeting ended on a positive note. 
 
----------- 
SFOR/Bosnia 
----------- 
 
7.  (C) In a brief pull-aside, Jimenez-Ugarte told Brzezinski 
Spain agreed SFOR should terminate by year\'s end with a 
follow-on EU force taking its place.  The GOS agreed that the 
EU force should reinforce the Berlin Plus principles, that 
DSACUER would have operational command, develop operational 
plans and carry out force generation, and AFSOUTH would be in 
the chain of command. Brzezinski emphasized the change in 
forces was not simply a re-flagging exercise -- the EU force 
would be different from SFOR and would focus on civil order 
and law enforcement functions.  The EU force would have a 
heavy police composition. Jimenez-Ugarte agreed with this 
formulation. 
 
 --------------- 
The Delegations

3.  (C) DASD Brzezinski was accompanied at the meeting by 
Clarence Juhl, Deputy Defense Advisor, USNATO; David Wright, 
Director of Infrastructure and Logistics, USNATO; El Wells, 
Assistant for NATO ACCS, USNATO; Anthony Aldwell, Senior 
Analyst, OSD/NATO Policy; and the Embassy\'s Pol-mil Officer, 
Defense Attache and Assistant Air Attache.  The Ministry of 
Defense\'s (MOD) Secretary General for Defense Policy, Javier 
Jimenez-Ugarte, headed up the Spanish side.  He was joined by 
Gen. Felix Sanz, Deputy Director General for International 
Relations, MOD; Adm. Enrique Perez, President of the Spanish

Classified By: Economic Counselor Judy Garber: Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Following up on our February 12 meeting with 
Ministry of Economy contacts (ref A), we met March 4 with 
Enrique Navarro, who is spear-heading Ministry of Defense 
efforts to help Spanish business get Iraq reconstruction 
contracts.  We shared lessons learned from the January 2004 
Czech business delegation to Iraq (ref B) and encouraged the 
Spanish to strongly consider a similar visit.  Navarro 
confirmed that a political decision had been made to turn 
down the proposed visit to Madrid by CPA Private Sector 
Development Director Tom Foley until after the March 14 
general election, but said the Spanish are keen to have the 
Foley team come to Spain as soon as possible thereafter. 
Navarro emphasized Spanish government and business bitterness 
over the decision to award a $327 million contract to equip 
the Iraqi Armed Forces to U.S. company Nour (ref A).  Navarro 
believes, however, that the USG\'s subsequent suspension and 
current review could open the door for a decision in favor of 
a Polish-led consortium to include Spanish, Romanian and 
Ukrainian firms (see para 5).  We recommend that CPA consider 
sending a team to Madrid in late March/early April and 
encourage prime contractors to hold briefing sessions in 
Madrid for Spanish companies interested in subcontracting 
opportunities.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Econoffs met March 4 with Enrique Navarro of Isdefe, a 
group created by the Ministry of Defense to help Spanish 
firms compete for military-related contracts.  Navarro was 
selected by Spanish Commissioner for Iraq and State Secretary 
of Defense Fernando Diez Moreno as the point-person for 
pursuing contracting opportunities in Iraq. 
 
Helping Businesses Get into Iraq 
 
3. (C) We related the positive experience and lessons learned 
from the Czech business delegation to Baghdad and suggested 
the Spanish consider doing something similar to improve the 
chances of winning Iraq contracts.  Navarro agreed a trip 
would be useful, particularly prior to the handover of 
authority at the end of June. We also mentioned our 
understanding that CPA Private Sector Development Director 
Tom Foley was still prepared to come to Spain to brief 
Spanish business on contracting opportunities and procedures, 
as he did recently in Warsaw and Rome.  Navarro acknowledged 
that the GOS decision not to accept a Foley team visit before 
the elections was political, but was enthusiastic about a 
visit as soon as possible after the elections (note: when 
pressed, Navarro averred that a visit could take place even 
before a new political team is formed, and regardless of 
which party leads the new government).  We suggested that 
Navarro contact Foley as soon as possible to discuss 
potential dates and arrangements.  We also undertook to give 
Navarro more information about how the Foley team visits were 
organized in Poland and Italy.  Finally, Navarro requested 
that at least one of the companies allocated prime contracts 
later this month under the next $8.2 million tranche of 
pledged aid hold a session in Madrid for possible 
subcontractors, similar to what Bechtel did in London last 
November. 
 
Spanish Still Hope to Get Contract to Equip Iraqi Forces 
 
4. (SBU) Navarro related strong Spanish government and 
business disillusionment with the contracting process so far. 
 Not only have Spanish companies been largely unsuccessful in 
getting contracts, but in one of the few cases in which a 
Spanish firm won (Defex, awarded a contract in November 2003 
to equip Iraqi police), the contract has yet to be formally 
signed. 
 
5. (C) But the crowning glory for the Spanish was the 
February 2004 decision to award the contract for equipping 
the Iraqi armed forces to U.S. group Nour.  As made clear in 
letters Fernando Diez Moreno sent to both DOD Comptroller Dov 
Zakheim and the Ambassador (ref C), the Spanish feel that 
their bid (organized by Isdefe) was right on the mark, and 
that the contract bidding and evaluation process was 
seriously flawed.  Navarro recognized that the U.S. had since 
suspended the contract for review.  He compared favorably the 
Spanish approach of mildly protesting the contract decision 
to Zakheim and the Ambassador versus the vociferous public 
and more formal complaints of the Polish and Jordanian 
bidders.  He reported he is in close contact with the Polish 
Bumar Group, and that Bumar and the Spanish consortium were 
joining forces, perhaps to include Romanian and Ukrainian 
groups, in the hopes of winning the contract under review 
when re-bid.  Navarro argued that a contract as important as 
the equipping of the Iraqi forces could not be left solely to 
private firms, and a consortium led by two state-run 
consortiums (Bumar and Isdefe) would ensure the job was done, 
and done well. 
 
6. (C) Navarro reiterated the now familiar complaint that 
working over the Internet was impractical and difficult for 
Spanish companies.  He also claimed that the time between RPF 
publication and bid due dates was implausibly short.  He 
raised the problem businesses face during the interim 
administration of Iraq concerning the legal continuity of 
contracts they may sign.  Navarro also admitted that overly 
optimistic initial GOS messages helped create the false 
impression that Spanish companies would get preferential 
treatment in the contracting process, acknowledging that the 
Spanish private sector\'s malaise vis-a-vis Iraq was partially 
of the GOS\' own making.  In his own view, however, a 
continued lack of Spanish business in Iraq would likely 
weaken Spain\'s long-term political commitment to Iraq. 
 
Comment and Recommendation 
 
7. (C) Navarro and the GOS are under pressure to \"show the 
beef\" to both Spanish business and the public in concrete 
Spanish contracts for Iraq reconstruction.  Spanish officials 
are frustrated with what they see as a difficult and flawed 
contracting process, Spanish firms\' lack of success to date, 
and their own inability to manage public expectations. 
Election politics have complicated the picture further. 
 
8. (C) Our recommendation is that CPA strongly consider 
sending a team to Madrid following the March 14 elections to 
further explain contracting opportunities.  We also support 
Navarro\'s call for one or more prime contractors to visit 
Spain to present subcontracting options, as well as a 
subcontracting presentation CPA/PMO may organize in Madrid. 
While we clearly cannot pull a rabbit out of the hat for the 
GOS (or Spanish business), we can do our best to make sure 
they receive the information that will aid their quest for 
reconstruction contracts.

TAGS: ENRG, BTIO, EPET, SP 
SUBJECT: OPPORTUNITIES IN SPAIN\'S GROWING ENERGY MARKET 
 
REF: 2003 MADRID 1079 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  Since joining the EU in 1986, Spain has 
experienced dramatic industrialization and economic 
development.  Along with development, energy consumption has 
skyrocketed and shows no sign of abating.  These developments 
bring challenges for a country that is now emitting 
greenhouse gasses more than its Kyoto commitments permit, and 
exceeding EU pollution emissions limits.  Spain has an 
ambitious but likely untenable plan for meeting the EU 
requirement to supply 12 percent of its energy needs through 
renewables by 2010, and will increasingly rely on natural gas 
imports as a relatively clean and inexpensive energy source. 
There are opportunities for US business to enter the Spanish 
energy market in such areas as gas, combined cycle generation 
and renewables, although experience to date suggests it may 
be advantageous to start small and learn the ropes, meet 
niche market demand, or enter into joint ventures with local 
companies rather than go it alone.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Spain\'s economy continues to be one of the most dynamic 
in the European Union, growing an average of 3.5 percent over 
the past six years.  Spain\'s demand for energy has grown even 
faster at an average rate of 4.5 percent per year between 
1998 and 2002, with electrical demand increasing at a 
particularly rapid rate of 6 percent per year.  Growth in 
total energy demand is expected continue at 3.5 percent 
annually over the next decade.  Spain is attempting to 
increase capacity to meet current and future demand through a 
combination of sources, including new natural gas pipelines 
from Africa and construction of combined-cycle electric 
generation facilities, while attempting to mitigate emissions 
increases through significant investment in alternative 
energy sources, especially wind power. 
 
Following is an overview of the energy market and suggestions 
for U.S. companies wishing to take advantage of significant 
opportunities. 
 
ENERGY LIBERALIZATION AHEAD OF SCHEDULE 
 
3.  Spain is implementing deregulation faster than most other 
EU countries.  Spain has adopted legislation to allow 
third-party access to the power network, and scheduled full 
liberalization of the energy market through various phases by 
2013.  So far, the primary benefit of liberalization is 
consumer choice among energy providers.  To date, price-based 
competition has been minimal. 
 
4.  Under a June 2000 law, Spain commenced separation of 
transmission, generation and distribution functions, and 
opened the energy grid to other suppliers several years 
before EU initiatives began forcing changes.  The oil, 
natural gas, and electricity markets have been key 
liberalization targets during the Aznar administration.  In 
the petroleum market, former government-owned Repsol was 
privatized in 1997 and is now Repsol-YPF (following a merger 
with Argentine company YPF).  It has reduced ownership from 
62% to around 26% in Compania Logistica de Hidrocarburos 
(CLH), the petroleum distribution company.  In natural gas, 
the market for industrial customers was partially opened in 
2000, and in 2002 the dominant conglomerate, Gas Natural 
Group, reduced its interest from 100% to 35% in the 
distribution company, Enegas.  Spain\'s largest electricity 
utility, Endesa, was privatized in June 1998.  Customers may 
now select their electricity supplier, and Spain has recently 
signed a pact with Portugal to form a single power market. 
As liberalization continues, and competitive forces 
strengthen in the energy sector, US business may find a 
myriad of opportunities for penetrating the Spanish energy 
market. 
 
NATURAL GAS 
 
5.  By 2010, the International Energy Association (IEA) 
anticipates that over 24 percent of Spain\'s electricity will 
be generated from natural gas.  This is up from 9.2 percent 
in 1999, and only one percent in 1990.  In 2003, natural gas 
accounted for 14% of the energy consumed in Spain.  In real 
terms, natural gas consumption is skyrocketing, with around 
1.7 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) used in 1985, 10 
Mtoe in 1999, and 13.5 Mtoe expected for 2010. 
 
6.  Although virtually all natural gas must be imported, its 
increased use may enable Spain to reduce its greenhouse gas 
emissions.  Spain has historically imported its natural gas 
from Algeria and Norway.  Libya has also been an important 
source.  Nigeria and Trinidad & Tobago are becoming major 
suppliers. 
 
7.  The Pedro Duran Farell pipeline connects Algerian natural 
gas supplies with the Iberian Peninsula, passing through 
Morocco and into Spain via the Strait of Gibraltar.  Spain is 
also connected to European supplies through the 
Lacq-Calahorra pipeline that runs from France.  The planned 
MEDGAZ pipeline will link the Algerian supply directly with 
Spain.  MEDGAZ partners include Sonatrach (Algeria\'s national 
oil company), Spanish companies CEPSA, ENDESA, and Iberdrola, 
BP, TOTAL, and Gaz de France.  With the new pipeline, imports 
from Algeria are projected to supply 60% of Spain\'s natural 
gas demand, but given the supply diversification strategies 
of the major players, this will actually signify a reduction 
in Algeria\'s share of the market. 
 
8.  Gas Natural is the leading natural gas conglomerate in 
Spain.  During the first quarter of 2002, Gas Natural 
maintained a 72 percent share of the liberalized gas market 
and gained a 4 percent share of the electricity market. 
 
9.  The US company AES, after years of regulatory delays, is 
constructing a 400 MW combined cycle facility in Cartegena, 
which is estimated to contribute over 500 jobs and more than 
$1 billion to the local economy. 
 
PETROLEUM 
 
10.  Oil plays a vital but decreasing role in Spain.  The IEA 
estimates that by 2010, only 7.6 percent of electricity will 
be generated from oil, down from 11.8 percent in 1999. 
Industrial and residential demand for oil is predicted to 
remain level while demand from the transportation industry 
will continue to grow for several years before leveling off. 
 
11.  The petroleum market is dominated by 
vertically-integrated REPSOL-YPF which provides over 50% of 
Spain\'s petroleum, although Cepsa and BP have significant 
interests as well.  Almost all oil is imported, with Nigeria, 
Libya, Saudi Arabia and Algeria being primary sources. 
Repsol-YPF also continues to invest heavily overseas.  In the 
last year, Repsol-YPF has announced major new projects in 
Venezuela, Iran and Libya, in addition to its enormous 
investment in Argentina. 
 
NUCLEAR ENERGY 
 
12.  The IEA estimates that by 2010, 24.4 percent of Spain\'s 
electricity will be generated from nuclear energy.  This is 
down from 28.5 in 1999 and 35.9 in 1990.  Majority or total 
ownership of all nine nuclear facilities is held by large 
Spanish energy companies Union Fenosa, Iberdrola, and Endesa. 
 The plants, built from 1971-1988, have the capacity to 
generate 7,897 megavolts. 
 
13.  A political moratorium on construction of new nuclear 
power plants was established in 1984 under the Socialist 
government, and not challenged by the current center-right 
government.  The government plans to maintain the number of 
licenses until 2012, and will only close individual plants if 
they outlive their usefulness.  However, because of Kyoto 
commitments, some believe the GOS may move towards a new 
program if the incumbent Popular Party carries the March 2004 
general elections.  The opposition PSOE has called for a 
formal nuclear moratorium within five years.  The Spanish 
public is not mobilized against nuclear energy, although 
groups such as Greenpeace have occasionally \"tested\" NPP 
security measures by trying to breach facilities and have 
protested against alleged safety deficiencies. 
 
COAL 
 
14.  The leading producers of hard coal in Spain are 
state-owned Hunosa and privatized Encasur, while Endesa is 
the leading producer of lignite.  The United States is a 
major exporter of coal to Spain.  The IEA estimates that by 
2010, 14.2 percent of Spain\'s electricity will be generated 
from coal, down from 36.6 percent in 1999 and 40.1 percent in 
1990.  However, in real terms, coal consumption is expected 
to increase slightly over the next few years, before leveling 
off. 
 
15.  Spain\'s coal costs far more than current world market 
prices.  A traditionally protected industry, some energy 
experts claim that Spain could save money by eliminating 
subsidies, shutting down the mines, and giving all current 
miners lifelong pensions.  But political factors would make a 
total shutdown difficult.  Coal production has been a 
significant industry in the northern coal-producing regions 
of the country, which are suffering from high unemployment. 
Rather than cutting production drastically and facing 
radically higher unemployment, Spain has initiated a program 
to wean domestic coal mining from subsidies and face world 
market conditions. 
 
HYDRO 
 
16.  According to the IEA, 14.7 percent of Spain\'s 
electricity will be generated from hydropower by 2010. 
Although it is anticipated that hydropower will produce 50% 
more power in 2010 than in 1999, its proportional share of 
total energy transformation to electricity will increase only 
3.6% largely due to the anticipated stronger increase in 
utilization of natural gas. 
 
17.  Large-scale hydroelectric production is expected to 
decrease from 2.645 Mtoe in 1998 to 2.121 Mtoe in 2010. 
Recouping that loss will be small scale hydro (less than 10 
megawatts (MW)) production growing from 0.482 Mtoe to 0.594 
Mtoe, and 10 to 50 MW hydro facilities contributing 0.542 
Mtoe.  The large hydropower plants are owned by Iberdrola, 
Endesa, Union Fenosa, Hidrocantabrico and Viesgo (affiliated 
with Italy\'s Enel).  These same companies own many smaller 
facilities as well.  Local engineering and construction 
company consortiums also build and operate small facilities. 
 
RENEWABLES:  WIND AND SOLAR POWER 
18.  Sunny, mountainous Spain is a prime prospect for wind 
and solar power generation.  As technology progresses and 
provides less expensive means of harnessing the power of the 
wind and the sun, Spain may use these power sources to great 
advantage as it seeks to reduce emissions. 
 
19.  Significant financial incentives, primarily sourced 
through EU cohesion funds, have caused most Spanish energy 
companies to develop renewables projects.  With approximately 
$1.5 billion allocated for environmental purposes, the 
central government distributes some funding to the regions 
for projects.  Along with the funds, the regional and local 
governments often provide additional incentives such as tax 
benefits and land donation or discount.  However, when the 
cohesion funds stop in 2007, it remains to be seen how much 
additional development will continue. 
 
WIND ENERGY 
 
20.  Spain is one of the world\'s largest wind energy 
producers along with the U.S. and Germany.  The land of Don 
Quixote and his windmills has long used wind for power 
generation.  But only recently have large-scale efforts begun 
to exploit this renewable energy source. 
 
21.  At the end of 1998, Spain generated only 800 MW from 
wind.  That almost doubled in 1999, and in 2003 total 
installed wind energy reached 6,202 MW.  Plans call for 
capacity increase to about 9,000 MW by 2010, and Spain is on 
its way to meeting that goal.  Regions with the most 
installed wind power generation are Galicia, Navarra, 
Castilla-La Mancha, Aragon and Asturias. 
 
22.  Some energy companies with interests in primary energy 
sources have also invested in wind generation facilities, 
among them Gamesa (the strongest), Iberdrola and Endesa. 
Additionally, smaller generators have emerged and several 
foreign developers, including American-owned Global 3 (see 
Paragraph 31), have plans to invest in wind power in Spain. 
 
SOLAR ENERGY 
 
23.  Still too expensive to compete with primary energy 
sources and wind power, current cost efficiency has not 
stopped research efforts or government incentives for small 
investment in solar power.  CIEMAT, the energy and 
environmental research arm of the Ministry of Science and 
Technology, has a solar platform research/production facility 
in southeastern Spain in the Desert of Tabernas.  It was 
developed to offer researchers a place where the climatic 
conditions are optimal for researching solar power production 
such as could be used within the sunbelt. 
 
24.  Prosolmed, a group of engineers and economists in the 
orange-growing region of Valencia, has taken advantage of 
some incentives for small-scale production and is trying to 
help city-living small investors get in on the action. 
Prosolmed claims that investors can enjoy a rate of return 
greater than 10%, and has installed 100 small solar panels, 
each occupying 50 square meters.  An article likens this 
venture to earlier Spanish tree plantation investment 
opportunities.  According to the article, a secondary market 
now exists for these plantation interests, suggesting that 
small investment solar opportunities might also be successful 
on Spain. 
 
25.  Solar energy technology still needs to advance and 
become more cost-competitive before it can supply a 
significant portion of the country\'s renewable energy goals. 
In 2001, Spain collected only 35 ktep (equivalent to 35,000 
tons of oil) of energy generated through solarthermic 
installations, and 2 ktep from photovolcaic installations. 
Spain\'s goals by 2010 include generation of 336 ktep from 
solarthermic sources, and 19 ktep from photovolcaic 
installations. 
 
ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION 
 
26.  Red Elctrica de Espaa (REE) is Spain\'s electricity 
transmission grid and system operator.  The GOS owns 28.5 
percent of REE, with Endesa, Iberdrola, Union Fenosa and 
Hidrocantabrico each holding 10 percent, Viesgo with 1 
percent, and the remaining 18 percent and 13 percent held by 
institutional investors and small shareholders, respectively. 
 The government fixes electricity rates on an annual basis. 
Only one foreign firm, ESB (of Ireland), currently operates 
within the Spanish electrical distribution industry, in the 
Basque region. 
 
27.  Although deregulation of this market enables consumers 
to shop freely for electricity, suppliers are required to 
sell at rates set by the government.  These mandated rates 
have fallen 35 percent since 1997.  But the lack of price 
competition reduces consumer incentive to change suppliers, 
making it difficult for competition to thrive. 
 
28.  The recently announced integration of the Spanish and 
Portuguese electricity markets into the \"Iberian Electricity 
Market\" will, per Vice President and Economy Minister Rodrigo 
Rato, form the fourth largest electricity market in Europe in 
terms of power generation capacity, and the second 
full-fledged electricity pool after Scandinavia\'s Nord pool. 
The new market will allow consumers to choose any electric 
company within the system as a supplier. With this 
integration, utility rates should fall; especially in 
Portugal where the rates are higher than in Spain. 
 
MARKET ENTRY BARRIERS 
 
29.  Spain is a difficult market for the foreign energy 
investor to successfully enter due to lack of transparency in 
bidding and permit processes, as well as the entrenched 
status of the incumbent companies.  Although GOS regulations 
suggest a liberalized market, large Spanish incumbents, many 
of which were state-owned monopolies, still control 
significant market share and have long-established 
relationships with (and the trust of) their regulating 
bodies.  Additionally, the GOS still holds \"golden shares\" of 
Repsol and Endesa.  These shares give veto power over 
corporate decisions that the GOS believes would affect 
national interest.  Spain\'s dominant energy companies have 
significant power and sophistication, with Repsol-YPF, 
Iberdrola and Endesa included in the Financial Times 500 List 
of top international companies.  It is not unusual that a new 
market entrant must negotiate for access to its dominant 
competitor\'s distribution network to get its product to 
market.  Relationships formed in grade school between 
regulators and corporate leaders also seem to play a strong 
role.  (See reftel for more information about Spain\'s \"old 
boys\" network.) 
 
30.  When U.S. companies have attempted to enter the Spanish 
market, they have faced significant delays in obtaining 
construction and other types of permits, while the Spanish 
and some other European companies (from countries who have 
permitted Spanish companies to enter their markets) tend to 
receive their permits rapidly.  While some attribute this to 
Spain\'s tendency to trust its incumbents, others add that 
many foreign companies ineffectually attempt to manage 
Spanish investment from London offices.  Despite 
difficulties, several US companies are making progress, 
including AES (see Paragraph 9) and Global 3. 
 
31.  Global 3 began in Spain in 1997 by building a one 
megawatt plant to learn how to work through Spain\'s 
labyrinthine permit processes and to prove that they could 
actually become successful on a small scale.  Per one of 
Global 3\'s owners, the company has vertically integrated and 
owns liquefied natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, 
has developed and operates five power plant projects, and 
continues developing various energy facilities, including 
wind farms.  The company attributes its success to its 
approach:  starting small, learning Spanish methods, 
establishing contacts, and building on experience. 
 
32.  An alternative approach for penetrating the Spanish 
market is filling demand within niche markets.  Chiptec 
Corp., a Vermont manufacturer of high fuel efficiency biomass 
gasification systems, found a Spanish food packing company 
who wanted to convert food waste into energy.  Chiptec sold 
equipment to suit this purpose in an arrangement valued at 
over $1 million, and has continued negotiating for more 
business in Spain.  US companies with products that would 
enable Spanish firms to increase efficiency or produce energy 
in non-traditional ways have a potential market in Spain. 
 
COMMENT: 
33.  The Spanish energy sector is changing in a primarily 
market-driven manner, with natural gas playing a dominant 
role in meeting energy needs and wind power playing a role in 
Spain\'s efforts to reach 12 percent of energy consumption 
through renewables by 2010.  Predicted strong growth will 
continue to provide opportunities for U.S. companies, not 
only in the traditional energy sectors but also in 
renewables.  Independent entry strategies into the Spanish 
energy market are problematic (but possible) due to permit 
processes and generally unavoidable negotiation with 
incumbent competitors for necessary services.  Importing 
energy to Spain\'s major energy companies for processing and 
distribution, establishing joint ventures and partnerships 
with Spanish companies, acquiring small-scale on-the-ground 
experience, or selling equipment or technology for less 
typical energy sources such as biomass, are some of the best 
strategies for US companies to successfully enter the Spanish 
energy market.  End Comment.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PGOV, PGOV, SP, SPPREL, SPPREL, Spanish Election March 2004 
SUBJECT: SPANISH NATIONAL ELECTIONS:  THE KEY ISSUES 
 
Classified By:  Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Political Counselor, 
Reasons 1.4(B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  As Spanish voters focus on the March 14 
nationals elections in earnest, three issues will dominate 
their thinking:  the war against ETA terrorism, unease over 
growing secessionist tendencies in the Basque and Catalan 
regions, and the economy.  On all three issues, Aznar,s 
Popular Party, now headed by Presidential candidate Mariano 
Rajoy, is banking on the PP,s strong record to sway voters. 
Recent polls, though showing a slight narrowing of the gap 
with the rival socialist party, continue to put the PP ahead 
by some 6 points.  The polls also indicate, however, that 
some 56 percent of the voters would like a change in 
government after eight years of government under Aznar,s 
Popular Party.  With some 23 percent of the voters still 
undecided, the desire for change factor could strengthen the 
Socialists showing and complicate the PP,s chances to 
achieve an absolute majority in Parliament. Socialist party 
candidate Zapatero is attempting to capitalize on the Iraq 
issue, but thus far has not translated this into a surge of 
support for his party.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) Though unofficially underway for months, the campaign 
for the March 14 Spanish national elections officially began 
February 27 at midnight local time (yes, the Spanish 
electoral campaign officially lasts only two weeks).  PP 
presidential candidate Mariano Rajoy and Spanish Socialist 
Party (PSOE) candidate Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapatero, have 
laid out their positions on issues ranging from high foreign 
policy to ameliorating traffic conditions on Madrid\'s 
notoriously chaotic streets.  However, three key issues will 
dominate:  the continuing war against ETA terrorism, the 
growing challenge in the Basque and Catalan regions for 
greater regional autonomy (and in the case of the Basque 
region, a separatist plan that fundamentally challenges 
Spain\'s delicate federal system), and the economy. 
 
3. (C) In each of these, the Popular Party\'s strong record 
has helped put PP candidate Rajoy some 6 points ahead of 
Zapatero.  Another recent poll indicates that Zapatero may be 
narrowing the gap as voters begin in earnest to focus on the 
elections, and still another shows the PP might well win the 
absolute majority.  The PP views its record on terrorism, 
regional issues and the economy as key to voter decisions on 
March 14.  Zapatero recently has played the foreign policy 
card, seeking to tap into widespread opposition to Aznar,s 
Iraq policy as a means to motivate Socialist voters, some 23 
percent of whom remain undecided. 
 
ETA Terrorism 
 
4. (C) Under the Aznar government, Spain has had significant 
success against ETA, rounding up key leaders, drying up 
operational and support networks. The dramatic arrest 
February 29 of two ETA operatives intent on a major action in 
Madrid underscored both the danger and the PP\'s success 
against ETA. 
 
5. (C) At the same time, the Socialist Party is still reeling 
from the scandal over Catalan Nationalist Carod-Rovira,s 
meeting with ETA in January, in which he tried to negotiate 
an ETA ceasefire in Catalonia (but not in the rest of Spain). 
 The issue brought in Zapatero and the national party because 
Carod\'s party had earlier entered into a regional governing 
coalition with the Catalan socialists.  Since the scandal, 
the PP has tried to cast doubt on the ability of the 
Socialist party,s national leadership to effectively deal 
with both the separatist and the terrorist issues.  However, 
the PP strategy may have a downside:  many thought that 
comments made by Interior Minister Acebes following the 
recent ETA arrests went too far:  he indicated that Carod 
should be pleased that the terrorists - who clearly sought a 
major explosion in Madrid - were not headed to Barcelona. 
 
6. (C) Still, a recent morning talk show question posed 
separately to Zapatero and to Rajoy underscores the two main 
candidates, differing approaches on the terrorism issue. 
The interviewer asked each candidate what he would do if he 
ran into a key ETA leader (named Anchon) on the street in 
Madrid.  Zapatero said he \"would not look at the man.\"  Rajoy 
replied, \"I would call the police.\" 
 
Regional Autonomy Issues 
 
7. (C) The Spanish electorate is also deeply concerned about 
growing separatist trends in the Basque and Catalan regions. 
Spaniards are worried that a separatist plan for the Basque 
region promulgated by Basque government leader Ibarretxe in 
the fall of 2003 could, if played out to its final chapter, 
lead to a constitutional crisis in Spain. The strong showing 
of the Carod-Rovira,s Catalan nationalist party in regional 
elections in December also put the autonomy issue front and 
center, particularly after the party joined the Catalan 
socialist coalition. Carod-Rovira,s meeting with ETA further 
exacerbated these concerns, and linked regional and terrorist 
issues in a way that could be deeply troubling for the 
Spanish electorate. 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PGOV, PGOV, SP, SPPREL, SPPREL, Spanish Election March 2004 
SUBJECT: SPANISH NATIONAL ELECTIONS:  THE KEY ISSUES 
 
8. (C) On Basque issues, Aznar has won praise for his firm 
approach to the Ibarrexte plan, but has also taken criticism 
for the perception that he is unwilling to offer any kind of 
conciliatory gesture to demonstrate he is at least willing to 
hear out Basque separatist concerns.  Zapatero and PSOE,s 
position is perceived to be somewhat weaker and more 
conciliatory, though in reality, his position is quite 
similar to that of Rajoy.   Zapatero has said he would be 
willing to talk to Ibarretxe, though it opposes his ultimate 
separatist goal.  Rajoy said he would talk to Ibarrexte, but 
stood firmly opposed to his separatist plan 
 
9. (C) The key issue which now differentiates the PP and the 
Socialists on regional/constitutional issues and terrorism is 
the Carod-ETA meeting scandal.  The PP has sought to position 
itself as the responsible party which will defend the 
constitution, and to paint the Socialists as a disunited 
party that cannot stand up for the unity of the Spanish 
state.  While the issue may hurt, Carod has apparently not 
suffered in Catalonia - his party may increase its seats in 
the national parliament from 1 to 6 seats. 
 
The Economy 
 
10. (C) With eight years of strong, steady economic growth 
and record levels of job creation, the PP can claim it is the 
party of economic stability and success.  Rajoy and the PP 
have made current economic minister Rato number two on the 
Madrid party list, second only to Rajoy.  Rajoy pictures 
alternate with those of Rato in campaign posters that line 
the streets of Madrid, clearly demonstrating that both 
continuity and the economy literally are the PP,s banner 
issues.  (FYI:  Pundits here speculate that Rato might become 
Foreign Minister under Rajoy, if he desired the position, but 
that even if he did, he would take it only for a limited 
period of time.  We understand he is actively lobbying, or is 
under consideration for EU/international slots as well.) 
 
11. (C) The main economic issues under debate between the two 
parties are: how to handle unemployment (now 11.2 percent 
down from over 20 percent in 1996) and which party\'s policy 
will generate the most new (and permanent rather than 
temporary) jobs; taxes -- the Socialists want a flat tax with 
more exemptions for the poorest and pensioners versus the 
third round of income tax cuts proposed by PP; and rapidly 
spiraling housing costs.  Most observers believe, however, 
that the generally favorable state of the Spanish economy 
will dominate Spanish voter decisions, and that the PP\'s 
strong record in this area will carry the day. 
 
Foreign policy 
 
12. (C) In recent weeks, Socialist leader Zapatero has 
focused on foreign policy, as a means to tap popular 
discontent with Aznar,s support for the Iraq coalition that 
brought millions into the streets in Spain in February and 
March of 2003.  Yet, in two regional elections since then, 
PSOE has been unable to turn the Iraq issue into an election 
winner for the Socialist party.  Also, Rajoy has pledged to 
continue Aznar\'s policies, but he has thus far avoided being 
\"tarred\" with responsibility for the Iraq policy.  Though 
foreign policy will not be the deciding factor in the 
elections, Zapatero is nonetheless aiming to remind voters of 
their unease with the PP,s Iraq policy and close ties to the 
US in order to motivate undecided PSOE voters. 
 
Desire for Change:  How Great a Factor? 
 
13. (C) While the key issues dominate, a final trend may 
shape whether the PP receives an absolute majority:  polls 
indicate that at least 56 percent of Spaniards would like to 
see a change in government after eight years of Popular Party 
rule and the firm style of President Jose Maria Aznar. 
 
14. (C) Two factors may mitigate this desire.  Rajoy may 
benefit from a popular perception even among the opposition 
that his more conciliatory personal style is far different 
from the strong hand of Aznar; and even PSOE insiders are not 
optimistic that the desire for change will translate into an 
unexpected victory for their party.  They acknowledge without 
prodding that the Socialists have not offered a credible 
alternative to the PP. 
 
15. (C) Nonetheless, this amorphous desire for change, 
combined with continued uneasiness over Iraq, could combine 
to reduce the PP\'s margin of victory and strengthen PSOE\'s 
electoral showing.   A few PP insiders are beginning to worry 
about this prospect after months of steady showing in the 
polls, as voters start to focus on their electoral choices in 
earnest with barely a week to go before the elections. 
 
The Absolute Majority Question 
 
16. (C) The PP strongly desires an absolute majority, and it 
will need to win 176 seats in parliament to claim it.  PP 
could also govern without problem if it wins 172 or 173 
E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/05/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PGOV, PGOV, SP, SPPREL, SPPREL, Spanish Election March 2004 
SUBJECT: SPANISH NATIONAL ELECTIONS:  THE KEY ISSUES 
 
seats, as it has an ironclad agreement that the 3-4 Canary 
Islands seats will join with PP on any issue.  An outcome of 
fewer than these needed seats, however, would create a 
difficult government formation process for the PP.  PP almost 
certainly would have to negotiate with the Catalan 
Convergencia and Union party, which will retain an estimated 
dozen parliamentary seats (down from 15 in 2000).  The PP 
drew on CiU votes in the first Aznar administration, but 
CiU,s terms would be very difficult this time around. 
Moreover, CiU does not agree with PP on all issues, including 
on some domestic issues and on Iraq.  A CiU leader has said 
that any CiU support for the PP in Parliament would be 
issues-oriented, not across the board.   Thus, the PP will 
need to win at least 172 seats in Parliament to maintain its 
current tight hold over the Spanish government.  Whether the 
PP will win this number of seats has become the key drama in 
this electoral campaign.

points. These often include requiring documentary evidence 
of relationship and permission for the child\'s travel from 
the parent(s) or legal guardian not present. Having such 
documentation on hand, even if not required, may facilitate 
entry/departure. 
 
5. For further information concerning entry requirements for 
Spain, travelers should contact the Embassy of Spain at 2375 
Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20037, telephone 
(202) 728-2330, or the nearest Spanish consulate in Boston, 
Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, 
San Francisco, or San Juan. Spanish government websites with 
information about entry requirements (in Spanish) can be 
found at www.mae.es and www.mir.es. For further information 
on entry requirements to Andorra, travelers should contact 
the Andorran Mission to the U.N., 2 U.N. Plaza, 25th floor, 
New York, NY 10018, telephone (212) 750-8064 or via the 
Internet at http://www.andorra.ad. 
 
6.  DUAL NATIONALITY: In addition to being subject to all 
Spanish or Andorran laws affecting U.S. citizens, dual 
nationals may also be subject to other laws that impose 
special obligations on their citizens. For additional 
information, please see the Consular Affairs Internet home 
page at http://travel.state.gov/dualnationality.html for our 
Dual Nationality flyer. 
 
7.  SAFETY AND SECURITY: Spain and Andorra share with the 
rest of the world an increased threat of international 
terrorist incidents. The ETA terrorist organization remains 
active in Spain. ETA attacks historically have been directed 
against the police, military, local politicians, and other 
Spanish government targets. However, in February 2004, ETA 
reiterated its intention to target Spanish tourist areas, 
advising that foreign nationals could be among the victims. 
Since 2000, ETA attacks have resulted in over two dozen 
fatalities and numerous injuries. In 2003, ETA activity 
included a thwarted attempt to bomb a train loaded with pre- 
holiday travelers. In 2001 2002, and 2003, ETA attacks 
included a number of car-bomb incidents, some occurring in 
areas frequented by tourists, including the Madrid and 
Malaga airports. While there were no tourist fatalities from 
these incidents, there have been a number of injuries. U.S. 
tourists traveling to Spain should remain vigilant, exercise 
caution, monitor local developments, and avoid 
demonstrations and other potentially violent situations. 
For the latest security information, Americans traveling 
abroad should regularly monitor the Department\'s Internet 
web site at http://travel.state.gov where the current 
Worldwide Caution Public Announcement, Travel Warnings and 
Public Announcements can be found. 
 
8.  CRIME: While most of Spain has a moderate rate of crime 
and most of the estimated one million American tourists have 
trouble free visits to Spain each year, street crimes 
against tourists occur in the principal tourist areas. 
Madrid and Barcelona, in particular, report incidents of 
muggings and violent attacks, and older tourists and Asian 
Americans seem to be particularly at risk. Criminals 
frequent tourist areas and major attractions such as 
museums, monuments, restaurants, outdoor cafes, Internet 
cafes, hotel lobbies, beach resorts, city buses, subways, 
trains, train stations, airports, and ATM machines. 
 
9.  In Barcelona, a number of attacks have been reported on 
Las Ramblas, near the Picasso Museum, in the Gothic Quarter, 
in Parc Gell, in Plaza Real and on Montjuic. In Madrid, 
incidents have been reported in  major tourist areas, 
including  the area near the Prado Museum, near Atocha train 
station, in Retiro Park, in areas of old Madrid including 
Sol and the El Rastro flea market, near the Royal Palace and 
in Plaza Mayor. 
 
10.  Travelers should remain alert to their personal 
security and exercise caution. Travelers are encouraged to 
carry limited cash, one credit card, and a copy of their 
passport; leaving extra cash, credit cards, passports and 
personal documents in a safe location. When carrying 
documents, credit cards or cash, you are encouraged to 
secure them in a hard-to-reach place and not to carry all 
valuables together in a purse or backpack. 
 
11.  Crimes occur at all times of day and night and to 
people of all ages.  Thieves often work in teams or pairs. 
In most cases, one person distracts a victim while the 
accomplice performs the robbery. For example, someone might 
wave a map in your face and ask for directions or 
\"inadvertently\" spill something on you. While your attention 
is diverted, an accomplice makes off with the valuables. 
Thieves may drop coins or keys at your feet to distract you 
and try to take your belongings while you are trying to 
help.  Attacks are sometimes initiated from behind, with the 
victim being grabbed around the neck and choked by one 
assailant while others rifle through or grab the belongings. 
Some attacks have been so violent that victims have needed 
medical attention. A group of assailants may surround the 
victim in a crowded popular tourist area or on public 
transportation, and only after the group has departed does 
the person discover he/she has been robbed. Purse-snatchers 
may grab purses or wallets and run away, or immediately pass 
the stolen item to an accomplice. A passenger on a passing 
motorcycle sometimes robs pedestrians. There have been 
reports of thieves posing as plainclothes police officers 
sometimes beckoning to pedestrians from cars and sometimes 
confronting them on the street and asking for documents. 
American citizens are encouraged to deal with uniformed law 
enforcement personnel only. 
 
10.  Theft from vehicles is also common. Items high in value 
like luggage, cameras, laptop computers, or briefcases are 
often stolen from cars. Travelers are advised not to leave 
valuables in parked cars, and to keep doors locked, windows 
rolled up and valuables out of sight when driving. \"Good 
Samaritan\" scams are unfortunately common, where a passing 
car or \"helpful\" stranger will attempt to divert the 
driver\'s attention by indicating there is a flat tire or 
mechanical problem. When the driver stops to check the 
vehicle, the \"Good Samaritan\" will appear to help the driver 
and passengers while the accomplice steals from the unlocked 
car. Drivers should be cautious about accepting help from 
anyone other than a uniformed Spanish police officer or 
Civil Guard. 
 
11.  While the incidence of rape and sexual assault is 
statistically very low, attacks do occur. Americans should 
not lower their personal security awareness because they are 
on holiday. Spanish authorities have warned of availability 
of so-called \"date-rape\" drugs and other drugs, including 
\"GBH\" and liquid ecstasy. 
 
12.  A number of American citizens have been victims of 
lottery or advance fee scams in which a person is lured to 
Spain to finalize a financial transaction. Often the victims 
are initially contacted via internet or fax and informed 
they have won the Spanish Lottery (El Gordo), inherited 
money from a distant relative, or are needed to assist in a 
major financial transaction from one country to another. For 
more information, please see the information sheet on the 
Bureau of Consular Affairs website at 
http://travel.state.gov/scams.html. 
 
13. Andorra has a low rate of crime. 
 
14. The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be 
reported immediately to the local police and to the nearest 
U.S. Embassy or Consulate. The Spanish government has a 
system for foreigners to file police reports by telephone 
with an English speaker, this must be followed up by a trip 
to a police substation to sign the form and obtain a copy. 
If you are the victim of a crime while overseas, in addition 
to reporting to local police, please contact the nearest 
U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance. The 
Embassy/Consulate staff can, for example, assist you to find 
appropriate medical care, to contact family members or 
friends and explain how funds could be transferred. Although 
the investigation and prosecution of the crime is solely the 
responsibility of local authorities, consular officers can 
help you to understand the local criminal justice process 
and to find an attorney if needed. 
 
15. U.S. citizens may refer to the Department of State\'s 
pamphlet, \"A Safe Trip Abroad,\" for ways to promote a 
trouble-free journey. The pamphlet is available by mail from 
the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing 
Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, via the Internet at 
http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs, or via the Bureau of 
Consular Affairs home page at http://travel.state.gov. 
 
16. MEDICAL FACILITIES AND INSURANCE: Good medical care is 
available in both Spain and Andorra. The Department of State 
strongly urges Americans to consult with their medical 
insurance companies prior to traveling abroad to confirm 
whether their policy applies overseas and if it will cover 
emergency expenses such as a medical evacuation. U.S. 
medical insurance plans seldom cover health costs incurred 
outside the United States unless supplemental coverage is 
purchased. Further, U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do 
not provide payment for medical services outside the United 
States. However, many travel agents and private companies 
offer insurance plans that will cover health care expenses 
incurred overseas, including emergency services such as 
medical evacuations. 
 
17. When making a decision regarding health insurance, 
Americans should consider that many foreign doctors and 
hospitals require payment in cash prior to providing service 
and that a medical evacuation to the United States may cost 
well in excess of $50,000. Uninsured travelers who require 
medical care overseas often face extreme difficulties, 
whereas travelers who have purchased overseas medical 
insurance have found it to be life saving when a medical 
emergency has occurred. When consulting with your insurer 
prior to your trip, please ascertain whether payment will be 
made to the overseas healthcare provider or if you will be 
reimbursed later for expenses that you incur. Some insurance 
policies also include coverage for psychiatric treatment and 
for disposition of remains in the event of death. 
 
18. Useful information on medical emergencies abroad, 
including overseas insurance programs, is provided in the 
Department of State\'s Bureau of Consular Affairs brochure, 
\"Medical Information for Americans Traveling Abroad,\" 
available via the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page or 
auto fax (202) 647-3000. 
 
19. OTHER HEALTH INFORMATION: Information on vaccinations 
and other health precautions, such as safe food and water 
precautions and insect-bite protection, may be obtained from 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s hotline for 
international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747); 
fax 1-888-CDC-FAXX (1-888-232-3299), or via the CDC\'s 
Internet site at http://www.cdc.gov/travel. For information 
about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad consult the 
World Health Organization\'s website at 
http://www.who.int/en. Further health information for 
travelers is available at http://www.who.int/iht. 
 
20. TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS: While in a foreign 
country, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that 
differ significantly from those in the United States. The 
information below concerning Spain and Andorra is provided 
for general reference only, and it may not be totally 
accurate in a particular location or circumstance. 
Safety of Public Transportation: Good 
Urban Road Conditions/Maintenance: Excellent 
Rural Road Conditions/Maintenance: Good 
Availability of Roadside Assistance: Good 
 
21. Traffic in Madrid and Barcelona is faster-paced than in 
U.S. cities and can be unnerving due to unfamiliar signs or 
motorbikes weaving between traffic lanes. Drivers should 
always obey the closest traffic light, as there are separate 
pedestrian lights in the city. Drivers should be alert when 
driving at night in urban areas, due to the possibility of 
encountering drivers or pedestrians under the influence of 
alcohol. Night driving in isolated rural areas can be 
dangerous, because of farm animals and poorly marked roads. 
Rural traffic is generally heavier in July and August as 
well as during the Christmas and Easter seasons. New traffic 
regulations went into effect in Spain as of January 30, 
2004.  of particular note is the prohibition on the the use 
of a mobile phone without a hands-free device while driving 
a car.  There is a fine of approximately 150 euros for 
violation of this regulation and loss of driving privileges. 
Pedestrians should use designated crossing areas when 
crossing streets and obey traffic lights. 
 
22. Public transportation in large cities is generally 
excellent. All major cities have metered taxis, and extra 
charges must be posted in the vehicle. Travelers are advised 
to use clearly identified cabs only and to ensure that taxi 
drivers always switch on the meter. A green light on the 
roof indicates that the taxi is available. Rail service is 
comfortable and reliable, but varies in quality and speed. 
Intercity buses are usually comfortable and inexpensive. 
 
23. For additional general information about road safety, 
including links to foreign government sites, please see the 
Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs home page at 
http://travel.state.gov/road_safety.html. For specific 
information concerning Spanish driving permits, vehicle 
inspection, road tax and mandatory insurance, please contact 
the Spanish National Tourist Organization offices in New 
York via the Internet at www.okspain.org. For information 
about driving in Andorra refer to the Andorran website at 
http://www.andorra.ad.htm. 
 
 
24.  AVIATION SECURITY OVERSIGHT: The U.S. Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA) has assessed the Government of 
Spain\'s Civil Aviation Authority as Category A -- in 
compliance with international aviation security standards 
for oversight of Spain\'s air carrier and airport operations. 
For further information, travelers may contact the TSA in 
the United Sates ,at 1-866-289-9673 or email TellTSA 
  (TellTSA@tsa.dot.gov) or visit 
the TSAs Internet website   at 
http://www.tsa.gov/public. 
 
 
25. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) separately assesses 
some foreign air carriers for suitability as official 
providers of air services. For information regarding the DOD 
policy on specific carriers, travelers may contact the DOD 
at telephone (618) 229-4801. 
 
26. CUSTOMS REGULATIONS: It is advisable to contact the 
Embassy of Spain in Washington, D.C., or one of Spain\'s 
consulates in the United States for specific information 
regarding customs requirements. This is especially important 
if you are attempting to send any medications to Spain 
through postal channels. Spain\'s customs authorities 
encourage the use of an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary 
Admission) Carnet for the temporary admission of 
professional equipment, commercial samples, and/or goods for 
exhibitions and fair purposes. ATA Carnet Headquarters, 
located at the U.S. Council for International Business, 1212 
Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, issues and 
guarantees the ATA Carnet in the United States. For 
additional information, please call (212) 354-4480, or send 
an e-mail to atacarnet@uscib.org, or visit www.uscib.org for 
details. 
 
27. CRIMINAL PENALTIES: While in a foreign country, a U.S. 
citizen is subject to that country\'s laws and regulations, 
which sometimes differ significantly from those in the 
United States and may not afford the protections available 
to the individual under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the 
law can be more severe than in the United States for similar 
offenses. Persons violating Spanish law, even unknowingly, 
may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned. Penalties for 
possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs in Spain are 
strict, and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences 
and fines. The Madrid City and Balearics Regional 
Governments have banned the consumption of alcohol in the 
street, other than in registered street cafes and bars. 
Visitors to Madrid, Mallorca, Ibiza and Menorca should be 
aware that failure to respect this law might result in the 
imposition of fines. 
 
28.  CHILDREN\'S ISSUES: For information on international 
adoption of children and international parental child 
abduction, please refer to our Internet site at 
http://travel.state.gov/children\'s_issues.htm l or telephone 
1-888-407-4747.

Non-proliferation has been high on the Spain-Iran bilateral

that the EU-3 believes that a carrot and stick approach is 
most effective with the Iranians.  The EU may thus seek a 
more flexible position on Iran.  Nonetheless, Rodriguez

Summary 
 
1.  (SBU) With the economy doing well, unemployment is 
nonetheless a prominent issue in the campaign for the March 
14 general elections, and remains one of the principal 
concerns of Spaniards.   The Popular Party, having halved 
Spain\'s unemployment rate from over 22% to 11.2% in eight 
years, is portraying itself as the party of proven job 
creation.   The Socialist opposition and the unions, 
particularly the UGT, are focusing instead on the precarious 
nature of some of the new jobs.   They emphasize that 31% of 
the jobs in Spain are on temporary contract, more than double 
the EU average.   The other major national union 
confederation, CCOO, has been more muted than the UGT in its 
criticism of the PP.   PP candidate Rajoy promises two 
million new jobs by 2008 and full employment, with a 6% 
unemployment rate, by 2010.   While the unions do not 
formally endorse candidates, the UGT has publicly allied 
itself with the Socialists.   End Summary. 
 
UGT Views 
 
2.   (U) On February 5, leaders of the General Worker\'s Union 
(UGT-traditionally allied with the Socialists), one of 
Spain\'s two large union confederations, held a conference to 
spell out the union\'s agenda before the March 14 general 
elections.  The leader of the Left Union (IU/Communist) 
party, Gaspar Llamazares, and Socialist Party (PSOE) National 
Coordinator Jose Blanco attended.   The PP was reportedly 
invited but did not attend. 
 
3.  (U) UGT Secretary General Candido Mendez argued that in 
the eight years of the Aznar government, the PP had 
\"squandered\" Spain\'s economic growth and neglected social 
spending.   Mendez drew particular attention to the fact that 
31% of Spanish workers are on temporary contract, a figure at 
least two times above the EU average.   Mendez said many of 
the jobs created during the PP mandate were \"precarious\" and 
lacking in benefits.   Workers in such contracted jobs are 
under-trained, over-worked, and prone to work-related 
accidents, Mendez said.  Mendez said this precarious 
employment exploits workers and ultimately lowers Spain\'s 
competitiveness.    Mendez also criticized the Aznar 
government for under-investing in research and development in 
new technologies.   Mendez argued that much of the job growth 
in the PP years was due to growth in Europe and worldwide, 
rather than to PP policies. 
 
CCOO Views 
 
4.  (SBU) Comisiones Obreras (CCOO ) originally allied with 
the Communist party but now independent and center-left) 
union officials share UGT\'s concerns on the need to shift 
more workers from temporary to permanent contracts. 
However, CCOO representatives noted to us that it was the 
Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez, rather than the PP, 
that had set up the rules governing temporary workers in the 
first place.   It is, they say, therefore disingenuous for 
the Socialists to criticize a system that they set up.   CCOO 
reps were more impartial in their party preferences and told 
us that CCOO can work with the PP as well as PSOE.   If the 
PP wins, CCOO would prefer that it not be by absolute 
majority.   They believe that the PP was more flexible and 
open to dialogue in the first Aznar term, when was forced to 
compromise to hold its coalition together. 
 
5.  (SBU) CCOO reps were also critical of the PSOE economic 
plan.   They regard Socialist candidate Zapatero\'s proposed 
tax policy as regressive, especially considering he is from 
the left.   They also do not see the budget numbers adding 
up.   Zapatero has pledged to keep close to a balanced 
budget, but CCOO sees PSOE pledges for greater spending 
combined with tax cuts adding up to budgetary problems. 
 
PP Platform: Proven Job Creation 
 
6.  (U)  Labor was a key issue in the electoral program the 
PP unveiled at their February 14-15 National Convention.  PP 
candidate Mariano Rajoy promised 2 million new jobs by 2008 
and a drop in the unemployment rate to 8% (from 11.2% at 
present).   The platform also called for reaching full 
employment, which the PP sees as a 6% unemployment rate, by 
2010. 
 
Socialist and Left Union Views 
 
7.  (U) On the campaign trail, Zapatero has repeatedly 
stressed the need to transform the precarious temporary jobs 
into \"dignified\" jobs.   The Left Union (IU)\'s Llamazares has 
made this a frequent refrain as well.   Zapatero\'s proposal 
to achieve this is to offer incentives to employers who offer 
full-time contracts. 
 
Comment 
 
8.  (SBU) The election campaign is occurring in the absence 
of any generalized labor strife.   (There have been isolated, 
and at times violent, protests by redundant ship workers from 
the Izar firm, but these are not election-related and not 
typical of the overall labor situation.)    While UGT support 
for the Socialists is clear, UGT is not convoking workers out 
to the streets to protest against the PP.   After the general 
strike of June 2002, the Aznar government backed off on labor 
reforms and avoided antagonizing the unions.   As a result, 
while unemployment remains a key issue, the role of the 
unions in the campaign has been, for the most part, marginal.

1. (SBU) Summary.  Spain\'s main opposition party, the 
Socialist Workers\' Party of Spain or PSOE, faces the 
unenviable task of running against what is inarguably an 
impressive record of economic growth and job creation under 
the ruling Popular Party (PP).  According to Miguel 
Sebastian, the architect of PSOE\'s economic program, there is 
no point in denying the PP\'s record of success. 
Nevertheless, he argues that the PP economic model has run 
out of steam, as job creation slows and Spain continues to 
lag behind its EU peers based on unemployment rates, slow 
productivity growth and low levels of investment in R&D. 
Sebastian also attacks PP policies which he alleges have 
allowed housing prices to spiral out of control. With its 
emphasis on cutting income taxes, investing in R&D and 
maintaining budget discipline, PSOE\'s economic program echoes 
the pillars of a traditional right-of-center economic 
platform.  The key question is whether the PSOE can convince 
voters that its change in tone is one of true conviction 
rather than electoral convenience.  End Summary. 
 
New Economic Program for a New Spain 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Since last summer, gossip columns in Spain\'s financial 
press have been filled with juicy stories about infighting in 
the PSOE over the party\'s economic platform for March 14 
national elections.  During its time in opposition, PSOE 
economic luminaries have harshly criticized the PP\'s economic 
policy for its stinginess on social benefits, emphasis on 
balanced budget at the expense of pensioners, failed housing 
policies and fake job creation through temporary contracts. 
In early summer, PSOE drafted Miguel Sebastian, the chief 
economist of Spain\'s second largest bank BBVA to join its 
ranks and advise the party on its economic platform.  The 
move was widely seen rebuke to PSOE economic spokesman Jordi 
Sevilla and caused consternation among some rank-and-file 
party members.  More recently, PSOE\'s Presidential candidate 
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has stated in press interviews 
that he would appoint the highly-regarded Sebastian as 
Economy Minister should PSOE win the March 14 elections. 
 
3. (SBU) A long time contact of the Embassy, Sebastian 
described for us the difficult time he has had trying to 
convince some in PSOE\'s leadership (other than Zapatero) of 
the need for \"a new economic platform for a new Spain.\" 
Sebastian argues that PSOE should never have lost the banner 
of the liberal economy -- it was PSOE that brought Spain into 
the EU and initiated reforms essential to bringing Spain into 
the euro zone. Yet many of PSOE\'s rank-and-file still see a 
Spain based on manufacturing jobs, not realizing that Spain 
has become a service-based economy.  Moreover, most Spaniards 
now own stocks and bonds.  They view economic issues very 
differently than ten years ago and are sophisticated enough 
to evaluate which party\'s economic policies will keep Spain\'s 
economy growing strongly. 
 
Simplify Taxes 
-------------- 
 
4. (U) Sebastian has crafted an economic platform based on 
changes to the tax code. On taxes, PSOE is calling for a 
decrease in the top personal income tax bracket to 27% 
(compared to the current 39%) while exempting pensioners and 
individuals who earn less than 12,000 euros annually.  The 
first 10,000 euros of income would be exempt from taxation 
(and 3000 euros more per child.)  Some presentations of the 
plan have talked of a \"flat tax\" or just two tax rates to 
simplify the code.  The government\'s accounts will be squared 
through more aggressive action against tax evaders and 
elimination of unspecified \"superfluous\" expenditures. 
Sebastian is convinced that these simplifications will 
encourage more Spaniards to pay their taxes and would 
certainly ease the ability of tax inspectors to fight tax 
evasion.  PSOE\'s economic program also echoes the Aznar 
government\'s commitment to balanced budgets.  Sebastian goes 
one step further, talking of requiring the government to run 
a budget surplus if economic growth exceeds three percent 
annually.  He also advocates controlling rapidly growing 
pharmaceutical expenditures paid by the government health 
service to keep them in line with GDP growth. 
 
More Investment in Training, R&D 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The PSOE economic program also focuses on the need for 
investment in R&D and investment in human capital to keep the 
Spanish economy competitive. To increase productivity, 
Sebastian argues that more investment in training workers is 
needed.  His goal is an increase over 1.5 percent annually in 
work productivity.  The fact that jobs on temporary contracts 
constitute almost a third of all salaried jobs is a 
disincentive for employers to invest in these workers and/or 
the equipment to make them more productive.  The Socialist 
platform notes the need to convert these jobs to part-time 
jobs rather than short-term contracts.  The PSOE also 
promises subsidies and other incentives to the private sector 
to encourage more R&D-related investment.  Sebastian believes 
Spain is capable of increasing such investment in R&D 
significantly and promises to reach EU targets in just a few 
years time. 
 
Rent Rather Then Buy 
-------------------- 
 
6. (U) With housing prices growing by about 17% last year, 
nearly one in five Spaniards now cites housing as issue of 
concern (ref B).  Attracted by historically low interest 
rates on mortgages, Spaniards over the past several years 
have been buying houses in record numbers and the supply of 
housing available for purchase is not keeping up with demand. 
 According to Sebastian, the problem is not the supply of 
housing per se -- thousands of apartments remain vacant 
because their owners perceive less risk just holding on to 
the idle property than renting.  PSOE is promising to 
introduce changes to incentivize a stronger rental market to 
encourage these owners to rent out now vacant apartments. 
 
Comment:  Imitation As Flattery 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) PSOE\'s economic program is chasing the middle class 
vote  - the new, increasingly prosperous Spain.  In the 
months before the official campaign kicked off, Sebastian and 
Zapatero met with business groups from around Spain to hear 
their concerns and reassure that a PSOE government would be 
pro-business. Sebastian seemed confident that they succeeded 
in persuading many of the regional business associations of 
PSOE\'s commitment to low taxes, a balanced budget and 
investment in R&D  -- many of the same goals voiced in the 
PP\'s economic strategy.  The PSOE seems to have decided that 
the only way to run against such a successful record on the 
economy was to cast itself as just as fiscally responsible 
and pro-business as the Aznar government.

.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Spanish regional leaders in Valencia, 
Asturias, Andalucia and Extremadura from both the Socialist 
and Popular Parties believe the Popular Party will gain the 
most seats in the March 14 national elections.  But most of 
them - except for two Socialist party members in regional 
Socialist strongholds and one PP operative - believe the PP 
may not win the absolute majority it needs to govern on its 
own.  These leaders also indicated that foreign policy, 
including Iraq, will not be a deciding factor in the 
elections; economic and local issues touching directly on 
Spaniards\' lives, will be the key issues.   Their views 
comport with conventional wisdom prevailing in Madrid less 
than a week before the elections, set for Sunday, March 14. 
The last polls permitted before the national elections came 
out on March 8 - each with slightly varied results depending 
on the political affiliation of the polling organization. 
Indications remain that the PP will form the next Spanish 
government, but will have to fight until the waning hours of 
the campaign to try to win an absolute majority.  End Summary 
 
2. (SBU) Embassy political officers visited four important 
regions in Spain to take the pulse of regional leaders and 
gauge the impact of regional issues on the national 
elections.  Two of these regions - Andalucia, and Extremadura 
-- are governed by well-known Socialist party bosses, both of 
whom are also frequently cited as possible replacements for 
Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Jose Luis Rodriquez 
Zapatero if their party loses badly in the national 
elections.  The regional Asturias government is a coalition 
of the Socialists and the radical United Left (IU) party. 
President Aznar\'s Popular Party (PP) governs the Valencia 
region and Valencia city\'s mayor is a prominent PP 
personality.  Valencia has been identified, however, as a 
region the PP must target to win over undecided voters.  None 
of these regions poses the kind of separatist or regional 
autonomy challenge of the Basque or Catalonia regions.  But 
each prides itself in its distinct regional autonomy, 
characteristics and history. 
 
ANDALUCIA:  SOCIALIST STRONGHOLD 
 
3. (SBU) The Popular Party is seeking to break the 
Socialists\' 22-year hold on the Andalucian government in 
regional elections March 14.  This will be the only regional 
election that coincides with the general election.  However, 
polling indicates that the PP will have a difficult time 
dethroning Socialist \"Baron\" Manuel Chavez, the region\'s 
long-serving President.  Indeed, some polling indicates that 
Chavez and the Socialists will win an absolute majority in 
the regional elections and thus be able to govern without 
coalition partners for the first time since 1994. 
 
4. (SBU) Socialist, PP, and Andalucian Regionalist (Partido 
Andalucista) politicians with whom Poloff met in Seville on 
March 3 noted that Andalucia has historically deep leftist 
roots that work strongly in favor of the PSOE.  They expect 
this to play out in the voting for the national election as 
well as for the Andalucian regional elections.  The PP does 
well in urban areas and controls six of Andalucia\'s eight 
largest cities.  However, the countryside, with its legacy of 
exploited peasants, remains solidly in the PSOE camp.  If 
trends continue, this should allow the PSOE to carry the 
region in the national election on March 14.   Both Zapatero 
and Rajoy have campaigned extensively in Andalucia. 
 
5. (SBU) The PP hopes to narrow the gap, and ultimately 
overcome it, by appealing to the sentiment that the Chavez 
government is an inefficient patronage-based regime that 
stifles economic growth.  However, many poor farmers in the 
countryside live off the patronage system (most notably an 
agricultural welfare system known as PER) and are fearful of 
reform.  The Chavez government also controls the regional TV 
station, Canal Sur, the only source of news in some rural 
areas.  Canal Sur\'s message is unabashedly pro-Chavez and 
pro-PSOE.  While the polling outlook for the PP looks tough, 
PP strategists hope for a \"hidden vote\" in their favor since 
Andalucians are reluctant to admit to pollsters that they 
support the PP. 
 
EXTREMADURA:  SOCIALIST REGION, LOCAL ISSUES 
 
6. (C) Extremadura\'s Socialist regional governor, Jose 
Ibarra, is one of PSOE\'s key party leaders.  His Chief of 
Staff, Ignacio Sanchez-Amor, indicated that Extremadura 
voters are less motivated by the issues that dominate the 
agenda of the national campaigns of both parties. 
Sanchez-Amor said that though unemployment is an important 
element in the national elections (with the PP able to claim 
a significant decline in unemployment since they took 
office), the issue is unlikely to bring voters out in support 
of the Socialist party nationally.  He also admitted that the 
PP has actually done a good job of creating a good investment 
climate to reduce unemployment in Spain.  He believes voters 
credit the PP for plans to extend the Madrid-Seville 
high-speed train all the way to Lisbon, which would benefit 
Extremadura.   Though tolerant of PP national government, 
Extremadura\'s Socialists remain staunchly loyal to Juan 
Carlos Ibarra, President and Secretary General of the 
regional Socialist Party.  Sanchez-Amor said voters admire 
Ibarra\'s willingness to speak out against PP \"excesses.\" 
 
7. (C) Both PSOE\'s Sanchez Amor and the Popular Party 
parliamentary candidate for the city of Badajoz warned us 
that national public opinion polling can be less than 
reliable.  Sanchez-Amor dismissed polling that indicates a 
majority of Spaniards would like to see a change in 
government, saying that if this were true they would be far 
less passive this electoral campaign.  He also discussed the 
composition of the some 23 percent who remain undecided.  He 
said that most of the older undecided voters consist of 
conservatives, those who have no strong ideological position, 
or those who will chose a candidate at the last minute. 
However, younger voters, who were not active in the last 
elections and who have strong ideological tendencies, are 
likely to turn out in greater numbers in support of the 
Socialists. 
 
8. (C) The PP\'s Pia-Sanchez believes the national polls are 
unreliable because voters tend to misrepresent how they 
intend to vote in informal telephone surveys, on which most 
Spanish polls are based.  She also expressed concern that 
polls favoring the PP might discourage potential PP voters or 
mobilize potential abstainers who are against the PP. 
Finally, she states, the polls satisfy the interests of the 
party who requests them rather than reflect how people will 
actually vote. 
 
9. (C) According to Sanchez-Amor, Spanish voters worry that 
Spain\'s support for US policies in Iraq created tension with 
their traditional EU allies.  Nevertheless, Spain\'s foreign 
policy is unlikely to be deciding factor in this election, he 
said.   Voters ideally want Spain to have influence within 
the EU while maintaining friendly relations with the US, no 
matter which party is in power after March 14.  Pia-Sanchez 
said that Spain under the PP would remain a close ally of the 
US and an active partner in Iraq.  However, she believes a PP 
government would focus more attention on cooperation with 
Latin America and the Middle East. 
 
ASTURIAS:  LINGERING TENSIONS FROM FRANCO ERA 
 
10. (SBU) In the 1980\'s Asturias could be counted on to vote 
PSOE in national elections, but the PP edged even in 1993 and 
1996, and pulled ahead in the 2000 congressional vote by a 
wide margin.   The Asturias regional government is formed by 
a PSOE-IU coalition, marking only the second time since the 
restoration of democracy that the Socialists have not ruled 
alone at the regional level (the other being a four-year term 
of PP control in the 1990s).  Of its nine Congressional 
seats, the PP currently holds five, the PSOE four and the 
United Left one.  This year, because of Asturias\' stagnant 
population growth, the region will receive only eight seats 
in Congress. 
 
11. (SBU) Asturias\' Autonomous Region President\'s Chief of 
Staff, PSOE member Maria Jose Ramos, told us that local 
concerns will dominate Asturias\' voter choices in the 
national elections.  These include the need to improve 
transportation links (especially those with its neighbors, 
Galicia, Cantabria, and the Basque region), solving the 
financial burden caused by unfunded mandates from the 
national government, employment and reducing home prices. 
She also said the region suffers because of its strained 
relationship with Minister-level officials of the PP national 
government.  She said she expects the PP to win on March 14 
(though without an absolute majority), but hopes that Rajoy\'s 
ministerial appointees will be more cooperative than Aznar\'s. 
 
 
12. (C) PSOE representatives, including the party\'s leading 
congressional candidate Alvaro Cuesta Martinez, echoed the 
same PSOE themes and cited the region\'s strained relationship 
with the national government as the main issue in Asturias 
for this election, closely followed by transportation 
infrastructure and housing prices.  They said they were 
expecting a PP victory nationally, and seemed resigned to the 
possibility that the PP would be able to govern with the four 
seats promised to them by the Canary Islands. 
 
13. (C) The PP\'s top regional candidate, Alicia Castro, 
placed terrorism at the top of Asturias\' issues, with 
employment issues a close second.  She blames the Asturias 
region\'s \"failings\" on \"incompetence\" at the regional 
government level, stating that the PSOE local officials are 
slow to act on programs and projects that the national 
government has funded.  In the national elections, she said 
she was confident of an absolute majority for the PP, stating 
that she expected around 177-178 votes for the PP, with even 
180 as a possibility. 
 
14. (C) Both political parties made a point to remind us of 
old grievances dating from the Franco era (Castro noting how 
the Communists burned Oviedo\'s cathedral in the 1930\'s, and 
Cuesta Martinez pointing out an interview excerpt in which an 
Aznar official purportedly expressed his admiration for 
General Franco).  Because of its mining, steel and iron 
industries, the region has a long history in Spain\'s labor 
movement (with the local PSOE party celebrating the 100-year 
anniversary of socialism in Asturias), and the PP and PSOE 
camps appear to have a particularly bitter relationship. 
 
VALENCIA:  PP COUNTRY 
 
15. (SBU) The PP won a convincing victory in Valencia in the 
2000 elections, capturing 9 seats versus 6 for the PSOE, and 
hopes to repeat that feat in 2004.  The PP benefits in 
Valencia, one of Spain\'s most economically dynamic regions, 
from the charismatic mayor of Valencia city, Rita Barbera. 
Barbera has won four terms and has a national reputation as 
one of Spain\'s best mayors.  She recently helped Valencia win 
selection as site of the next America\'s Cup (since the 
previous winner, Switzerland, can\'t host). 
 
16. (SBU) DCM and Poloff met with Barbera in Valencia in 
February.  Barbera was confident that the PP would maintain 
its edge in Valencia on March 14.  Political analysts Poloff 
met with in Valencia, including Socialists, shared this view. 
 They conceded that the PP had governed well in Valencia and 
that this did not give the PSOE much of an opening.  The PP 
has been pushing a national water plan that works to 
Valencia\'s benefit and this has won PP popularity as well. 
Nonetheless, some polls indicate that the PP\'s margin may 
drop by one seat on March 14, reflecting a general tightening 
of the race nationwide.  Rajoy addressed his largest rally of 
the election campaign in Valencia on March 8, speaking before 
a crowd of up to 20,000.

SUBJECT: SPANISH RESPONSE TO 60TH SESSION OF THE UN 
COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS DEMARCHE 
 
REF: A. STATE 41252 
 
     B. MADRID 0735 
     C. CLASSIFIED EMAIL FROM MADRID TO SPAIN DESK ON 25 
        FEB 2004 
 
Classified By: Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Political Counselor, for Reasons 1 
.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  The head of the MFA\'s Human Rights Office 
stated that Spain\'s priorities for the upcoming UN Commission 
on Human Rights (UNCHR) session are substantially the same as 
USG priorities, focusing on many of the same countries and 
issues.  On sensitive subjects, he said that Spain will work 
within the EU to try to find compromises on wording for a 
Rights of the Child resolution and will seek to minimize the 
number of resolutions regarding the death penalty.  Spain\'s 
most pressing concern this session, however, will be in 
responding to the February 6 report by the UN Special 
Rapporteur on Torture that concluded that torture of ETA 
terrorist suspects is practiced to a degree in Spain.  That 
report may have broader implications as it strongly 
criticizes incommunicado detention of terrorist suspects. 
The report also concludes that allegations of torture, even 
if acknowledged as a tactic used by terrorist groups to 
falsely discredit a government, cannot be discounted due to 
the Rapporteur\'s belief that incommunicado detention 
facilitates torture.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) We delivered reftel A demarche to Juan Manuel Cabrera, 
MFA Human Rights Office Director, on March 8.  When asked 
about Spanish priorities for the 60th Session of the UNCHR, 
Cabrera said that they are supporting resolutions on Belarus 
(will co-sponsor with EU), Turkmenistan, Afghanistan (sharing 
USG concerns that an Independent Expert has not been 
appointed), Russia-Chechnya (introduced by the EU), East 
Timor, North Korea, Nepal, Burma, Congo, Zimbabwe (though 
maintaining dialog with Mugabe government), Sudan, Colombia 
and Cuba.  He stated that he had not heard if Canada would be 
introducing a resolution on Iran, but that Spain would likely 
support such a resolution.  Similarly, he had not heard who 
would introduce a Cuba resolution this session, but thought 
that Costa Rica would be a likely candidate (Note: President 
Aznar has reportedly pressed Honduran President Maduro to 
introduce the Cuba resolution (ref B)).  Cabrera inquired as 
to whether the USG had decided to introduce a China 
resolution.  When informed that we were still studying the 
issue, he stated that Spain would wait to see the text before 
making a decision.  He reiterated Spain\'s position that China 
is making slow progress on human rights, but said he felt 
that at times the dialog was a little bit \"good for nothing\" 
(reiterating the case Charge made to Deputy Foreign Minister 
Gil-Casares (ref C), we took this opportunity to provide 
Cabrera with a digital copy of the 2003 Human Rights Report 
for China).  Cabrera further stated that Spain agreed that 
now was not the time for a resolution on Iraq and that he is 
not aware of anyone supporting the introduction of an Iraq 
resolution this session. 
 
3. (C) Regarding our request for support in opposing 
unbalanced resolutions against Israel, Cabrera said that 
Spain was also opposed to inflammatory resolutions and that 
they would work to limit the number of resolutions on Israel, 
possibly even down to one combined resolution.  (Comment: 
While Post is encouraged by Cabrera\'s statement, we note that 
the Spanish MFA made the same statement of support before the 
last session, but went on to follow the common EU line in 
voting for resolutions that condemned Israel. End comment). 
 
4. (C) Cabrera said that Spain\'s theme-based issues would be 
terrorism, racism, the death penalty, Rights of the Child, 
and a EU-backed resolution on anti-Semitism.  He mentioned 
that Spain and the EU would also be looking with interest to 
a resolution on Israeli settlements proposed by the Arab 
group.  In response to demarche talking points regarding 
resolutions on the Rights of the Child and the death penalty, 
he said that Spain would work within the EU to find 
compromise wording for the Rights of the Child resolution 
that could be acceptable to the USG.  He said Spain would \"do 
its best\" on seeking EU support for a single death penalty 
resolution, though he seemed less optimistic on this point. 
 
5. (C)  Cabrera stated that Spain agrees with the USG that 
the UNCHR is not the appropriate forum for a resolution on 
corporate conduct, and has problems with the Norms proposed 
by the Sub-Commission.  He also mentioned that Spain and the 
EU would vote against \"no-action\" motions, and that Spain 
supports the idea of developing a network of democratic 
countries in the UNCHR.  Responding to the talking point 
question on where Spain saw an opportunity for USG 
assistance, he stated that the Russia-Chechnya issue was one 
in which coordinated US-EU lobbying would be useful. 
 
6. (C) Cabrera explained that along with this overall agenda, 
Spain would be responding forcefully to the report issued by 
the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Theo Van Boven, 
regarding his October 2003 visit to Spain.  In that report, 
dated February 6, Van Boven concludes that torture, namely of 
ETA terrorist suspects held incommunicado for short periods, 
is practiced by Spanish authorities.  The report acknowledges 
that there is evidence that ETA instructs its members to 
claim torture whenever they are detained as a tactic to 
falsely discredit the Spanish government.  However, Van Boven 
concludes that because of the consistency of these 
allegations and his belief that, by its nature, incommunicado 
detention facilitates torture, instances of torture in Spain 
are \"more than sporadic or incidental\".  The Spanish 
response, dated March 4, is 87 pages in length and details 
what the Spanish believe are factual errors, baseless 
conclusions, and faulty methodology on Van Boven\'s part. 
Specifically, the Spanish criticize Van Boven for using 
second-hand accounts and anonymous sources, all lacking 
evidence to back their allegations.  The Spanish response 
also criticizes the Van Boven report for not considering the 
possibility that the allegations of torture are consistent 
for the very fact that Van Boven acknowledges, that ETA 
instructs its members on what to say. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  This report could have broader implications 
in that Van Boven concludes that any practice of holding 
terrorist suspects without allowing outside contacts of the 
detainee\'s choosing can constitute torture.  In his 
recommendations (paragraph 66), Van Boven writes \"Since 
incommunicado detention creates conditions that facilitate 
the perpetration of torture and can in itself constitute a 
form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even 
torture, the incommunicado regime should be abrogated\".  This 
statement has ramifications on governmental efforts to ensure 
that detained terrorist suspects do not pass operational 
information to their associates on the outside.  Cabrera said 
that while there is not a vote to accept this report, Spain 
would appreciate the support of its allies on this matter, 
either in writing as an addition to the Spanish response or 
in discussions of the Van Boven report at UN meetings.  Post 
has discussed ETA allegations of torture with Amnesty 
International and the Spanish Ombudsman\'s Office in its 
research for annual Human Rights Reports, and both 
organizations agree that no proof exists to substantiate 
those claims, nor has any other pattern of abuse of prisoners 
by Spanish authorities been noted.  Post recommends that USG 
UN representatives convey our findings as appropriate.  End 
comment. 
 
8. (C) Wrapping up the meeting, Cabrera renewed Spain\'s 
request for USG assistance in lobbying for their candidacy 
for one of the three WEOG seats on the UNCHR, recalling that 
it was Spain\'s withdrawal of their candidacy that allowed the 
USG to return to the commission after losing our seat on the 
UNCHR.

SUBJECT: EQUATORIAL GUINEA: SPANISH MFA ON ALLEGED COUP 
PLOT AND INSTABILITY 
 
Classified By: Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Polcouns, per 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
Summary 
 
1.  (C) President Obiang has demanded that Spain extradite to 
Equatorial Guinea a political opponent who resides in Madrid, 
Severo Moto, accused of sponsoring an alleged coup plot 
uncovered this week.   MFA has received no official request, 
and would not transfer Moto if one were received.    MFA 
regards EG as being in a period of heightened instability, 
with Obiang lashing out at his inner circle as well as the 
opposition.   End Summary. 
 
No Formal Extradition Request Received 
 
2.  (C) The Spanish MFA has received no formal request from 
the Government of Equatorial Guinea for the extradition of EG 
opposition politician Severo Moto, who resides in Madrid and 
heads a self-proclaimed EG government in exile.   FM Palacio 
said this publicly on March 9.    Ildefonso Castro, Chief of 
Staff to MFA Secretary of State Gil Casares, confirmed this 
to us March 10.   The EG government claims that Moto was 
behind an alleged coup plot involving hiring mercenaries to 
overthrow Obiang and kill his ministers.    However, the only 
EG request for extradition of Moto thus far has come from a 
radio address from President Obiang in which he called on 
Spain to extradite Moto to EG or risk harm to relations. 
Obiang said that \"Spain must decide it is with Moto or with 
Guinea.\" 
 
GOS Would Not Turn Over Moto 
 
3.  (C) Castro noted that the GOS response, as FM Palacio has 
told the media, is that an extradition has to go through 
judicial channels.   Castro noted that only if the judiciary 
were favorable would there be a political decision.   He did 
not envision any circumstance under which the GOS would turn 
Moto over to the Obiang government, since Moto would not face 
a fair trial.   Moto, in comments to the Spanish media, 
roundly denied any involvement in the plot and claimed it was 
all an Obiang stunt to discredit the opposition.   Moto said 
that \"it is Obiang\'s modus operandi: he is able to kill 
people and then to blame us for it.\" 
 
Conspiracy Theories 
 
4.  (C) Castro said it was unclear if the coup plot 
allegations had validity.    He said that the items taken off 
the plane in Zimbabwe, where 64 supposed coup plotters were 
intercepted, were not military supplies.   He also doubted 
that such a small number of mercenaries, plus a supposed 15 
others on the ground in EG, were credible as a coup force. 
Castro noted that the plane detained in Zimbabwe came from 
South Africa, where Obiang recently went on private travel. 
Speaking personally, Castro speculated that it is possible 
that during his stay in South Africa, Obiang may have 
arranged to stage the incident. 
 
5.  (U) In comments to the media March 9, FM Palacio 
distanced Spain from the alleged plot.   She said that \"From 
Spain, we can only say that we have warm relations with 
Guinea and we support constitutional democratic regimes and 
condemn any attempt to end the democratic order.\" 
 
A Highly Unstable Situation 
 
6.  (C)  Castro views the situation in EG as highly unstable. 
 This instability permeates even to Obiang\'s innermost 
circle.   Castro recounted how in December 2003 Obiang 
arrested his cousin, Gen. Agustin Ndong, a top associate, for 
allegedly plotting against him.  Castro said that over a 
hundred other suspects were rounded up in conjunction with 
Ndong\'s arrest, most from Obiang\'s own tribe.   (Castro noted 
that Ndong is now in Spain (Las Palmas, Canaries) for medical 
treatment after two suicide attempts; the most recent one 
involved drinking poison which caused severe internal burns.) 
   Castro added that on March 6 the chief of security for the 
continental region of EG, Nguema Eye (as heard), who was in 
Obiang\'s inner circle, died in a traffic accident under 
mysterious circumstances.   Spanish MFA observers suspect 
that Nguema may have been killed, possibly on Obiang\'s order. 
 
7.  (C)  Castro concluded by noting that EG\'s territorial 
dispute with Gabon, which affects oil concessions, further 
adds to the instability.   It was unclear, he said, what 
France\'s role in this is.    (Spanish media speculate that 
France and/or French oil interests may be working to 
overthrow Obiang.)

DEPARTMENT FOR M, DS, DS/OFM, EUR/EX, EUR/WE 
 
E.O. 12958:DECL: N/A 
TAGS: AMGT, KREC, SP 
SUBJECT:  OFM AND EMBASSY MADRID DISCUSS 
TAX AND VEHICLE ISSUES WITH SPANISH MFA 
 
1.  Summary:  DS/OFM DAS lead a negotiating team 
consisting of Embassy Management Counselor, HRO Senior 
FSN, and an OFM Program Officer in discussions with 
Spanish representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs 
and Finance.  This meeting focused on two issues: (1) the 
continued practice of the GoS to not grant the A&T staff the 
same tax relief benefits extended to diplomats and consular 
personnel and (2) the lengthy period it takes for official and 
personal vehicles to be properly registered and plated in 
Spain, including the issuance of cover plates.  End Summary. 
 
2.  DAS began the meeting by explaining the role of OFM 
and its interest in the tax and vehicle privileges extended to 
US Mission personnel worldwide.  OFM\'s authority to 
employ reciprocity without further approval from Congress 
was also detailed.  With this point as background, it was 
stressed to the Spanish side that improvements in their 
treatment of Post and its personnel, especially in the area of 
tax relief, could allow for an immediate and positive 
response from OFM. 
 
3.  Given that during past negotiations the Spanish 
Government has made clear that their interpretations of the 
tax relief obligations detailed in the VCDR and VCCR are 
inconsistent with those of the USG, a decision was made not 
to readdress this line of argument, but rather to seek a 
practical solution to this real problem for A&T staff.  DAS 
expressed the personal interest of Secretary Powell in 
securing the equitable treatment for all accredited members 
of US Missions abroad.  The Spanish were further informed 
that their policy of disallowing tax privileges for members of 
the A&T staff is practiced by only three other nations: the 
Bahamas, Barbados, and Morocco.  The US side advised 
that, according to OFM records, Spanish A&T personnel 
make up 53% of the nation\'s Mission to the US.  To provide 
a possible roadmap for achieving a mutually beneficial 
solution to this issue, information on recent agreements that 
resulted in the reciprocal extension of tax benefits to A&T 
personnel at the US Mission in Austria and Slovenia were 
discussed. 
 
4.  The Spanish delegation, led by the MFA\'s Director 
General of Protocol, began by expressing envy for the 
unique authority granted to OFM for dealing with matters of 
this nature.  He advised that under current regulations, the 
GoS had little leeway to quickly address or remedy the A&T 
tax situation.  Currently, such an action would require a 
change of law, which can be a lengthy and uncertain process. 
Diplomatic privileges in Spain are not extended by virtue of 
reciprocity and are uniform by decree.  Therefore, bilateral 
agreements on such issues do not appear viable.  However, 
the Spanish side agreed to study this issue and explore 
possible solutions with the best of intentions. 
 
5.  Secondly, DAS discussed Post\'s concerns with the current 
lengthy period (as long as two months) required for the GoS 
to properly register and plate Post\'s official and personal 
vehicles.  The OFM practice of registering vehicles within 
one day was described.  The Spanish seemed genuinely 
surprised by the news that there has been such a long delay 
in the processing of vehicle registrations.  They quickly 
agreed that even a one month delay is unacceptable, and they 
assured the US side that this issue would be promptly 
addressed.  Post will provide a list of the outstanding 
registrations so that action can be taken immediately.  The 
Spanish side expressed regret that, given the bureaucratic 
limitation of the Spanish system, the efficiency of OFM 
could not be matched, but agreed that improvements can be 
achieved.  The Spanish explained a new initiative underway 
to make the registration process web-based.  In theory, this 
will allow for a more efficient and smoother process. 
 
6.  In addition to the registration issue, the issuance of cover 
license plates for security purposes was addressed. 
Currently, the GoS will provide only one cover plate for each 
US Mission family.  This action forces family members to 
decide which vehicle and passengers remain a soft-target for 
terrorist actions. DAS made a strong appeal for the issuance 
of cover plates to all members of Post without limitation. 
The Director General of Protocol agreed that providing only 
one cover plate per family provided little benefit of security 
for a diplomatic family.  He recounted his personal 
experience as a terrorist target while he was serving outside 
Spain and how the lack of cover plates negatively affected 
him and his family.   He promised that action would be taken 
to address both the registration and licensing of vehicles. 
 
7.  As a final note, DAS requested an update on the situation 
concerning the seizure of Post\'s official VAT 
reimbursements due to judicial action.  The Spanish 
expressed their concern over several court decisions to seize 
USG\'s VAT refunds.  They noted that in some cases the 
Spanish State Attorneys had been denied participation to 
appeal and defend the non-attachability of the USG\'s VAT 
refunds.  They also pointed out that there is no law in Spain 
that addresses the immunity of a Foreign Sovereigns assets 
and that some Spanish judges tend to uphold the basic 
fundamental rights of citizens when these conflict with 
diplomatic immunity.  They reiterated that the MFA shared 
the USG\'s position and arguments on this issue and, as 
explained above, Spanish law does not clearly define the 
extent of diplomatic immunity, which leaves such matters 
open to judicial interpretation.  The MFA representative 
from its Legal Department expressed some optimism that a 
possible pending U.N. resolution may provide assistance in 
this matter, however others on the panel expressed privately 
that this position may be overly optimistic.

Classified By: A/DCM Carol Urban per 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (SBU) ETA terrorists struck March 11 in the center of 
Madrid, placing bombs on four commuter trains.   There were a 
total of 13 explosions (including three police-controlled 
explosions to disactivate bombs.)    The bombs exploded in 
the middle of rush hour, from 0835 to 0855 local.  Interior 
Minister Acebes confirmed that the GOS had \"no doubt\" that 
ETA was responsible.   He also confirmed that there were no 
advisory calls before the bombs went off.   The death toll 
continues to mount.   According to Acebes and other official 
sources, the death toll was 173, with more than 600 wounded. 
 FM Ana Palacio also commented to the press that ETA was 
responsible, as did Popular Party candidate for President of 
the Government, Mariano Rajoy. 
 
2.  (C) As noted in reftels, ETA experts in the Spanish 
police, as well as other Spanish officials, had expressed 
concern to us that ETA would seek to strike before the March 
14 general elections.   Our contacts said ETA would seek to 
strike during the high profile election campaign to 
demonstrate that, despite suffering unprecedented arrests and 
disruption, it had not given up.   In the past two months, 
police have had success in disrupting two major ETA attempted 
attacks.   On February 29, two ETA operatives were arrested 
about 100 miles east of Madrid.    One was driving a truck 
laden with 536 kg of explosives, destined for detonation in 
Madrid.    On December 24 police stopped an attempt by two 
ETA operatives to place backpacks laden with explosives on a 
train going from Irun (Basque region) to a Madrid train 
station.   Acebes said that this demonstrated ETA had been 
looking for a spectacular attack, with major civilian 
casualties.   He added: \"I will not accept the intolerable 
assertion by those who try to divert the culpability to other 
groups.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) As a result of these and other police operations, 
and the arrest of 126 ETA operatives and accomplices in Spain 
in 2003, ETA had not killed anyone in a terrorist attack 
since May 2003.   The total of three ETA killings for 2003 
was the lowest figure in ETA\'s history (apart from brief 
periods of unilateral \"cease-fire\").   Prior to this attack, 
ETA\'s highest number of victims in a single attack was in 
Barcelona in 1987 when ETA exploded a bomb in a Hipercor 
shopping center, killing 21.    (ETA claimed that it did not 
intend to kill so many civilians at Hipercor but that there 
had been a problem with the warning call.)    Apart from 
this, several ETA attacks caused 10 or 12 fatalities, often 
against police targets.    But ETA had more typically 
targeted its victims more discriminately, generally killing 
one or two at a time.   The total number persons ETA had 
killed, before the March 11 Madrid attack, was about 850. 
 
4.   (C) This attack comes only three days before March 14 
general elections.   Both major political parties have 
canceled campaign events, including major end of campaign 
rallies scheduled for March 12.   A spokesman for ETA\'s 
political arm, the de-legalized party Batasuna, Arnaldo 
Otegi, claims that the attack could not have been by ETA 
since, he claimed, ETA phones in ahead of time.   Otegi 
attributed the attack to Islamic extremists.    President\'s 
Office contacts have called us to stress that the GOS is sure 
that the perpetrator is ETA, as Acebes has stated 
emphatically.   They request that the USG support this in its 
declarations and not express any doubt in public comments 
about the party responsible. 
 
5. (SBU)  The Ambassador has called King Juan Carlos, FM 
Palacio, Madrid Region President Aguirre and President 
Aznar\'s Office to express our solidarity with Spain.    FM 
Palacio made a point in her conversation with the Ambassador 
in objecting to media use of the term \"Basque Separatists\" to 
describe ETA.   Now more than ever, she stressed, ETA must be 
called only by the name of \"ETA Terrorists.\"   The Ambassador 
will also write letters to Interior Minister Acebes, the 
Mayor of Madrid, and other senior officials. 
 
6.  (C) Comment:  The magnitude of death and injuries caused 
by the attack is unprecedented in ETA\'s history and is, by 
far, the worst terrorist attack Spain has suffered.   The 
fact that there was no warning call combined with massive 
civilian casualties represents a major departure in ETA\'s 
modus operandi.   The two foiled attacks mentioned (para 2) 
above indicate that ETA was already changing its tactics in 
favor of indiscriminate attacks.   As per reftels, an ETA 
under intense police and judicial pressure and lacking in 
technical skill for pinpointed attacks appears to have 
decided to lash out, not unlike a wounded animal, to cause 
maximum civilian harm.  As far as the political campaign is 
concerned, Mariano Rajoy and the Popular Party, have made 
waging the war against ETA, without compromise or dialogue, 
central to their campaign.    An ETA attack, even this 
enormous one, should thus not work against the governing 
party.   However, if ETA\'s political wing (the de-legalized 
Batausna) is able to seed doubt about the perpetrator, some 
might blame the PP government for exposing Spain to Islamic 
extremist terrorism because of its Iraq policy.   Hence the 
call to us from Moncloa for the USG to be clear in public 
comments that the perpetrator of this tragedy is ETA.

1.  (U) In response to the multiple train bombings in Madrid 
on the morning of March 11, the Ambassador chaired a full EAC 
meeting to discuss the impact and implications, if any, on 
the Embassy personnel and facilities as a result of the 
bombings.  Highlights of some general and operational 
contingencies for the Ambassador to deal with can be found in 
reftel. 
 
2.  (U) At 0735, the first detonations occurred.  By 0745, 
the Embassy was in contact with the State Department 
Operations Center and since that point, the OPS Center has 
been kept informed and updated.  A verification of the safety 
and accountability of all employees was conducted by 
Management and Human Resources.  One employee had been in an 
adjoining commuter train coach and had been splattered with 
blood splatter but was unharmed.  PA established themselves 
as the communication Source, anticipating press inquiries. 
As of 1700 hours, no American citizens have been indentified 
as being involved in the bombings. 
 
3.  (U) At 1300 hours, a moment of silence was held in the 
Embassy to honor those individuals (173 at latest count) who 
lost their lives.  Also at 1300 hours, supportive 
demonstrations took place in virtually every precinct of 
Madrid.  The Spanish Government has declared a period of 
three days of official mourning and the Embassy and Consulate 
General in Barcelona will honor it by carrying our flags at 
half-mast. 
 
4.  (U) The physical security situation of the Mission was 
reviewed to consider any needed upgrades as a result of the 
terrorist act and determined to be fine as is.  The 
Ambassador has canceled an event scheduled for this evening 
as a show of respect and solidarity and spoke to all 
employees at 1615 hours today to discuss the tragedy and 
offer condolences.  The Embassy will be participating in a 
program of blood donation to assist with the community\'s 
needs and, a Locally Employed Staff (LES) appreciation day 
scheduled for Friday has been postponed.  A Warden Notice has 
been produced and has been distributed to stem the tide of 
questions and concerns, and an in-house Staff Notice was 
circulated to deal with employee questions. 
 
5.  (SBU) The local police and Guardia Civil have 
demonstrated a concern toward Mission by increasing their 
presence and have reported two incidents of suspicious 
vehicles patrolling past the Embassy, which are currently 
being investigated.

commitments in Iraq and the Balkans, Spain would have a 
difficult time committing more than the current 130 or so 
Spanish troops in Afghanistan for ISAF expansion.  That said, 
Spain agrees that no one can afford a NATO failure in 
Afghanistan and will look at all options to determine if it 
is be possible to contribute to ISAF expansion and the 
deployment of new Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). 
 
2.  (C) Acerete also noted that Spain is one of the five 
countries that make up Eurocorps, which has offered to 
provide the headquarters element for ISAF for six months 
beginning in August.  Spain would expand its participation in 
ISAF via Eurocorps if an agreement is reached for Eurocorps 
to participate.  We suggested that if Eurocorps does handle 
the headquarters element it would be more appropriate for it 
to do so for 12 months rather than just six months.  Acerete 
said Spain was considering this option but pointed out that 
prior contingents have lead headquarters for only six months. 
 
3.  (C) Acerete emphasized that Spain understands the 
critical importance of expanding ISAF and will do all it can 
to assist ISAF in accomplishing its mission.

SUBJECT: Spanish Customs Administration 
 
REF: State 42299 
 
1.  This cable contains responses to reftel cable re: EU 
member state customs regimes. Responses are queued to 
questions listed in reftel para 6. We collected the 
information during routine visits with Customs and business 
contacts. 
 
A. CUSTOMS PROCEDURES The formal procedure is comprised of 
two steps, each with its respective time period.  The first 
step begins upon the arrival of goods from outside the EC, 
at which time the importer has twenty-four hours to make a 
summary declaration of the goods.  Many importers provide 
this declaration even before their goods arrive in a Spanish 
port or airport to help speed up the process.  The summary 
is transmitted electronically to a central office, where the 
information is reviewed.  The Customs Administration does a 
risk analysis of the goods, and color-codes the imports 
according to their degree of risk.  About 80% of the goods 
are marked \"green\" and are released into the stream of 
commerce without any additional review.  The next status is 
\"orange,\" which requires further examination of documents 
and later will be marked \"green\" or \"red.\"  Approximately 
10% of goods are labeled \"orange,\" primarily for sanitary 
and phytosanitary concerns.  The other status is \"red\" 
(roughly 5% of goods), which requires the examination of 
both documents and goods. 
 
The second step involves a more specific declaration of the 
goods imported and includes a declaration of value and 
destination.  The time limit on this step varies depending 
on whether the goods arrive via air or sea.  If the goods 
arrive by air, the importer has twenty days to make a 
declaration, while goods that arrive by sea have a more 
generous time period of forty-five days.  There are three 
points in time when Customs may choose to reevaluate its 
valuation: 1) when Customs is initially reviewing documents 
for an orange or red status shipment; 2) during subsequent 
office reviews of documents for green status shipments that 
have already entered; and 3) after Customs does routine 
annual on-site inspections. 
 
B. APPEALS PROCESS If the importer wants to appeal the 
decision of Customs authorities, especially in the case of a 
discrepancy in the valuation of customs duties, then the 
appeal would be directed at the Tax Collection Department 
(Departamento de Recaudacion) of the Tax Administration 
(Administracion Tributaria).  This is the only part of the 
Tax Administration empowered to hear claims and make 
reimbursements.  Importers have two appeals-the decision on 
the first appeal must be made within 15 days. If the 
importer chooses to appeal a second time, the Collection 
Department must review within 15 days.  If the importer is 
still not satisfied, he can then take the decision to court. 
If the claim is not resolved after exhausting national 
means, the appeals process can be taken to the European 
level, but most appeals are solved within the Department. 
 
C. See response to question A. 
 
D. PENALTIES Customs tax fraud is considered to be the 
incomplete disclosure in the declaration to customs 
authorities.  Penalties fall into the following three 
categories depending on the gravity of Customs law 
violations: minor, severe, and very severe.  The penalty is 
always issued as a fine, which depends on the degree of the 
violation.  If the fines total more than 30,000 euros 
($36,900 at exchange rate of 1.23), then authorities can 
impose additional non-monetary sanctions. 
 
E. RECORDS Spanish Customs retains records for four 
years-the law requires them to retain records for three 
years for customs purposes, but for four years for Value 
Added Tax records. The three years leeway allows Customs 
authorities the possibility to review records, and 
subsequently collect customs duties that were insufficient. 
 
F. GUIDANCE Exporters can request guidance from Spanish 
Customs if they have any uncertainties over classification 
and evaluation of goods.  The exporter simply submits a form 
to Customs authorities.  Customs authorities usually respond 
in 15 days (however it can take up to 2 months depending on 
the number of requests they receive).  If the exporter does 
not agree with Customs, then he has the opportunity to make 
an appeal within fifteen days. 
 
G. EU MEMBER STATES In theory all Customs of the member 
states should operate in the same manner.  However, business 
contacts and Spanish officials say Dutch Customs are less 
stringent than their Spanish counterparts.  A business 
contact told us that Spanish Customs is comparable to the 
authorities in Italy and Greece.  For the most part, our 
business contacts were not aware of discrepancies in customs 
duties in different member states, however we are aware of 
one American company that has been unable to resolve a 
Spanish Customs valuation that differs from the valuation in 
another member state. 
 
2. Spanish Customs and the Tax Collection Department are the 
only two departments under the Spanish Tax Administration 
that are involved with customs regulations.  The Tax 
Administration is part of the Spanish Treasury Department. 
 
3. In 1995, Spain began incorporating information technology 
into its customs procedures.  Now, at least according to 
Spanish Customs authorities, Spain\'s Customs Department is 
the most technologically advanced of the EU-15 member 
states.  A business contact confirmed that the system is 
completely electronic and works smoothly.  Spanish Customs 
Agents also claim that Spain\'s customs procedures are 
stricter than countries with larger volumes of imports, such 
as Holland, Belgium, and Sweden (our Customs contacts 
referred to Holland as the \"colander of Europe\").  Despite 
the stringent process, Spain\'s Customs Department seems to 
function efficiently as information is processed 
electronically and centrally.  Spain has also made the 
process more efficient by making arrangements with importers 
from reputable multinational companies.  In this 
preferential agreement, companies make a guarantee payment 
of customs duties, and their goods are released immediately 
into the stream of commerce.  They are billed monthly for 
customs duties.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN\'S UNITED LEFT (IU) PARTY: A DECLINING FORCE 
BUT STILL PLAYING A ROLE 
 
REF: MADRID 0613 
 
1. (SBU) Note: This message was planned prior to the March 11 
terrorist attacks in Madrid as a feature of Embassy\'s advance 
reporting on Spain\'s March 14 elections.  It provides a 
snapshot of the United Left Party, one of Spain\'s smaller, 
but still significant political parties.  End note. 
 
2. (SBU) Summary:  The grouping of communist and 
communist-leaning parties, the United Left, finds itself 
still playing a role in national elections this year, but its 
influence has been trending down since 1996, and there are 
some who foresee its eventual disappearance from the national 
scene.  If the Spanish Socialists get within striking 
distance of forming a coalition government, the IU will 
definitely be supportive, but differences between the IU and 
the Socialists continue to rule out full coordination to 
unseat the PP.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
History of the United Left 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The United Left (IU) is an electoral coalition that 
was organized in 1986.  Its dominant member is the Communist 
Party of Spain (PCE), and other partners include radical 
socialists, greens, and supporters of Spain\'s old Republic of 
the 1930s.  The PCE participated alone in the 1977 and 1979 
elections, winning 9.4 percent (20 seats) and 10.8 percent 
(23 seats) of the vote, respectively.  After a miserable 
showing in 1982 that left it without representation, it 
emerged again (reorganized under the United Left coalition) 
in 1989 to win 9.1 percent (17 seats).  The IU vote grew 
slightly in both the 1993 and 1996 elections, reaching 10.5 
percent of the vote (21 seats) in 1996.  In the 2000 election 
Popular Party (PP) landslide, the IU fell to its current 8 
Congressional seats, winning just 5.4 percent of the vote. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
When Socialism\'s Not Left Enough 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4. (SBU) While they share many leftist viewpoints, divisions 
run deep between the IU and the Spanish Socialist Party 
(PSOE).  The PCE originally broke with the PSOE due to 
ideological differences in the early 1920\'s.  In general 
terms, the IU views the PSOE as a centrist party, not 
leftist, claiming that the PSOE is too closely wed to 
capitalism, market-based economics and other 
\"non-progressive\" policies.  While not communists in the full 
Marxist-Leninist sense (the IU advocates democracy and does 
not oppose private property, in fact it supports creating a 
\"right to private property for all\"), the IU does still seek 
a \"non-capitalist\" economic model that would give a greater 
role to the public sector and better redistribute wealth. 
 
5. (SBU) The IU agrees with the PSOE agenda on such issues as 
increased spending on social programs, education and 
environmental protection.  On foreign policy, they agree with 
the PSOE on making Spanish relations with the European Union 
primary to any trans-Atlantic relationship with the US, and 
in opposing Spanish military involvement in Iraq.  However, 
the IU advocates other positions that are radically left of 
the PSOE, such as terminating military basing rights for US 
forces, holding a resolution to determine if Spain should 
leave NATO, rejecting the EU common position towards Cuba, 
and more actively supporting the Palestinian cause by 
suspending the EU Association Agreement with Israel. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Role and Future of the IU 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) While under Spain\'s system of proportional 
representation in Congress, there would be a great advantage 
for the IU and PSOE to run as a combined electoral coalition 
of the left (see reftel), neither party has been willing to 
team together since the period leading to the Spanish Civil 
War.  Poloff spoke to Fernando Vallespin, a political science 
professor at the Autonomous University of Madrid who has ties 
to the PSOE, and Vallespin said that such a grouping would 
likely scare off moderate PSOE voters to such a degree that 
it would negate the benefit of running a combined slate. 
 
7. (SBU) Spain\'s proportional representation system 
under-represents the votes of the small parties, giving them 
a lower percentage of Congressional seats compared to the 
true percentage of votes they receive.  Hence, if the only 
goal was to unseat the conservative PP government, leftist 
votes would be better used if they went for the much larger 
PSOE.  This fact has not been lost on the PSOE, who have 
campaigned this election for left-wing votes under the slogan 
of \"Voto Util\" (which can be translated as \"Useful Vote\" or 
\"Vote that Matters\"), trying to convince far-left voters not 
to diminish anti-conservative voting power by voting for the 
smaller IU.  The PSOE leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, 
has also stated that the Socialist will not attempt to form a 
government if they do not win more votes than the PP.  While 
few believe that the PSOE would pass up a chance to form a 
coalition with smaller parties if the opportunity presented 
itself, the statement is seen as another measure to tempt IU 
voters to 
vote for the PSOE.  The IU has aggressively fought back 
against the \"Voto Util\" campaign, with the party\'s leader, 
Gaspar Llamazares, calling the PSOE slogan repugnant and 
against democratic ideals of pluralism.  Llamazares has also 
derided Zapatero as trying to change Spain\'s parliamentary 
system into an American-style two-party system with his 
threat to not form a coalition government if the PSOE comes 
in second. 
 
8. (SBU) Professor Vallespin states that in essence, the IU 
vote is a protest vote, and electoral calculations have never 
been a primary concern to its voters.  Given that much of the 
far-left disdains the PSOE as a \"centrist party\", and the 
fact that IU leaders cherish their independence and have 
actively sought to energize their base with the need for a 
\"true left\" agenda, he did not believe that IU voters would 
be swayed to vote Socialist in significant numbers. 
 
9. (SBU) With polls showing that the IU should retain a share 
in Congress close to its current eight seats, the IU could 
play a role in forming a coalition government with the PSOE 
should the PP falter.  They also make up coalition PSOE-IU 
governments in some of Spain\'s autonomous regions, with the 
IU\'s strongholds being Andalucia (the mayor of the major city 
Cordoba is IU), Asturias, Madrid, Valencia and the Basque 
region.  That said, the IU vote has been trending downward 
since 1996, and there are some who forecast its eventual 
demise as a national presence. 
 
10. (SBU) Juan Diez-Nicolas, President of ASEP, a prestigious 
polling and sociological studies firm, told Poloff that their 
forecasts see the IU as a dying force.  He believes that 
there will always be an anti-establishment protest vote, 
especially among students and labor groups, but that with 
Spain\'s economic gains and movement towards a more 
service-oriented economy, this protest vote could likely sink 
below the three-percent threshold to receive seats in 
Congress.  Professor Vallespin stated that he agrees that the 
IU may disappear, as a part of the IU\'s vote has been linked 
to families with ties to the Spanish Republic of the 1930s. 
With very few elderly voters who actually participated in the 
Republic surviving, these ties are getting stretched, 
according to Vallespin, as grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren feel less personal association to the 
Communist and old Republic movements.  The IU had been hoping 
to draw in a whole new generation of supporters from the 
millions of Spaniards who protested against the war in Iraq 
and the Aznar government\'s support of US policies.  However, 
the huge anti-war protests did not translate into an increase 
in support for the IU in the regional elections of May 2003, 
with the IU actually losing seats in the regional races.  If 
this anti-war vote does not materialize for the IU in this 
national election, their hopes of regaining their old 
prominence may be lost.

1.  We raised the USG reform proposal on decision-making with 
the MFA\'s Director General for International Economic 
Relations German Bejarano.  He described Spain as strongly in 
favor of a reform on decision-making in the OECD.  Bejarano 
criticized the lack of leadership evinced by the Secretary 
General in failing to forge consensus on priorities and the 
elimination OECD bodies that no longer made sense. 
 
2.  Bejarano said the Spanish government is seriously 
studying the US proposal. In general, it coincides with the 
direction Spain believes the reform should take, though 
clearly smaller OECD states will be instinctively concerned 
about any proposal that eliminates consensus, very 
reminiscent of other debates currently going on in Europe. 
He cautioned that this was a preliminary reaction which had 
yet to be vetted on the interministerial level.  With 
elections scheduled March 14, an interministerial meeting to 
consider the proposal would be unlikely until just before the 
ECSS meeting.  Also, with anticipated changes in the 
political level of relevant ministries, Bejarano doubted that 
Spain would come to the ECSS able to voice a well-defined 
position.  He promised a readout of interministerial 
deliberations.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/11/2014 
TAGS: PTER, PGOV, PREL, SP, Spanish Election March 2004, PSOE - Socialist Party, Popular Party 
SUBJECT: SPANISH ELECTIONS: SCENARIOS FOR COALITION 
BUILDING AFTER MARCH 14 
 
Classified By: Polcouns Kathleen Fitzpatrick per 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
Summary 
 
1.  (C) Before the March 11 terrorist attacks, the 
conservative Popular Party and its candidate Mariano Rajoy 
were slated to win the Spanish elections, but few confidently 
assessed the PP would win an absolute majority in Parliament. 
 As part of Embassy Madrid,s election reporting plan, we 
have been developing an alternative scenario analysis to 
provide Washington readers with some thoughts on what might 
transpire in Spanish coalition-building processes, including 
if voters turn months of polling statistics into a Dewey 
Defeats Truman headline.   These alternative scenarios could 
play themselves out even in the new context created by the 
terrorist attacks (septel).  By law, pollsters had to stop 
taking and reporting polling data on the elections on March 
8.  Thus, the polling snapshot on the elections does not take 
into account the impact of the terrorist attacks. 
 
2. (C) Depending on the election outcome March 14, the PP 
could form a strong absolute majority-backed government, or a 
weak, heavily-conditioned, minority government.  Should 
election results go much worse for the PP than polling has 
indicated, there is the chance of an \"All Against the PP\" 
coalition taking over, led by the Socialist party.    This 
\"Government of the Left\" would likely be unstable and would 
be strongly opposed to the PP\'s pro-US orientation and to US 
Iraq policy.   End Summary. 
 
Three Scenarios for a PP-Led Government 
 
3.  (C) According to a range of polls (conducted before the 
polling deadline of March 8) the Popular Party looks set to 
be the party that gets the most votes on March 14.   However, 
the race is not about a PP plurality, but about whether the 
PP can obtain a majority sufficient to govern.   PP 
strategists have consistently told us that they hope for, but 
are by no means sure of, an absolute majority.    Lack of an 
absolute majority means the PP would have to seek coalition 
partners, something it is in a far worse position that the 
Socialists to do.   Thus, winning the most seats may not be 
enough.   Following are three scenarios that would enable the 
PP to govern after March 14: 
 
-- Option One: An absolute majority of 176 seats or more. 
The PP received an absolute majority of 183 seats in 2000. 
This would give the PP a free hand (and was the main reason 
Aznar could make such unpopular policy choices as joining 
forces with the US on Iraq, and survive.) 
 
-- Option Two: Close to an absolute majority, 171-172 seats 
or more.   The PP is confident it can count on the Canary 
Coalition party for its estimated 4 or 5 seats should the PP 
fall just short of an absolute majority.  This would mean a 
virtual absolute majority for the PP. 
 
-- Option Three: 164 seats or more.   The situation becomes 
much more complicated.    This would require the PP to obtain 
the support of the moderate Catalan nationalist (CIU) party 
and its approximately 11 seats.   PP strategists believe the 
PP would be able to negotiate a deal for the CIU\'s support, 
but it would be difficult and the resulting PP government 
would be weak.   It might not last a full term.   PP 
strategists point out a fundamental divergence between the PP 
and CIU: CIU wants to revise the autonomy statute that 
governs division of powers between Madrid and Catalonia, and 
the PP believes this is unnecessary.    Other Spaniards 
support such an option and prefer a weak PP government that 
has to rely on negotiations with partners, rather than a PP 
with an absolute majority that can do what it wants. 
 
What if the PP Falls Short? 
 
4.  (SBU)  If the PP does significantly worse than expected 
on March 14, it would open up the possibility of an 
alternative scenario: an \"all against the PP\" coalition.   PP 
candidate Rajoy made a point of stressing this prospect on 
the campaign trail.   In refusing to debate Socialist leader 
Zapatero one-on-one, Rajoy said that he would only debate if 
it were against the totality of the anti-PP forces.   This 
includes, apart from the Socialists,  the Left 
Union/Communists (IU), the Catalan Republicans (ERC), and 
other regional parties, including possibly the Basque 
Nationalists (PNV).    CIU leaders have said publicly that 
they are leaving their options open and would not rule out 
support for such a government. 
 
5. (SBU) Gaspar Llamazares, the IU leader, has been most 
explicit in his call for a \"Government of the Left\" to unite 
to defeat the PP.    While Llamazares concedes that the PP 
appears likely to be the party most voted, he believes that a 
broad coalition can prevent the PP from forming the next 
government.    Indeed, Llamazares says the goal of the 
election is to deny the PP a governing majority. 
 
Zapatero\'s Pledge 
 
6.  (SBU) Socialist leader Zapatero has, to the consternation 
of the IU and others on the left, pledged he would not seek 
to form a governing coalition unless PSOE is the party most 
voted.   In making this declaration, Zapatero seeks to win 
over votes from IU and others on the left as he has by 
stressing that he is a \"man of the left.\"  Former President 
Felipe Gonzalez, speaking in the Socialist heartland of 
Andalusia on February 29, called on voters from the left to 
vote for the PSOE, where each marginal vote, because of the 
seat distribution system, counts for more. 
 
7.  (C)  Zapatero has also appealed to voters\' desire for 
change and has campaigned hard for the votes of the undecided 
and those who were thinking of staying home.   Polls have 
shown that about 58% of Spaniards want a change in 
government.   The challenge for Zapatero has been to 
translate this desire for change into votes for the PSOE. 
Prior to he cessation of the campaign following the March 11 
terrorist attacks, Zapatero appeared to be making inroads 
with this theme and narrowing his margin with Rajoy. 
 
An \"All Against the PP\" Coalition? 
 
8.  (C) Zapatero has made his pledge repeatedly, so he would 
find it difficult to break it, even if the opposition to the 
PP obtains more seats than the PP, and its few allies, can 
muster.   The core of the \"All Against the PP\" coalition 
would be a significantly strengthened PSOE, joined by IU 
(communists) as a junior partner.    If the PSOE were to get 
150 seats, 25 more than in 2000, and more than estimated in 
any poll, this would form a workable base.   The IU might get 
nine, the Catalan Republican Nationalist ERC as many as six 
seats, the Galician Nationalist BNG 3 seats.   The Basque 
Nationalist PNV might lend it support, adding another 7-8 
seats.    The CIU might, under the right terms, lend its 
support as well along with their roughly 11 seats. 
Political observers speculate that, if he could find a way to 
govern, Zapatero might find a way out of his pledge. 
Others speculate that Zapatero would keep to his pledge, 
allow the PP to form a weak minority government, and hope to 
see that PP government fall and PSOE take over in a much 
stronger position. 
 
Comment: Impact on US Interests 
 
9. (C)  An \"All Against the PP\" coalition would be inherently 
unstable.   It would also have a foreign policy orientation 
very different from that of Aznar, Rajoy and the PP. 
Zapatero has pledged to pull Spanish forces out of Iraq by 
June 30, 2004 if the mission is not under UN auspices by that 
date.    Zapatero has been relentlessly critical of US Iraq 
policy, of President Bush, and of Aznar\'s deepening of 
relations with the US, which he blames for having alienated 
Spain in Europe.   Zapatero\'s partners would be even more 
opposed to US policy, and thus hem in any natural Socialist 
tendency to moderate on US relations once in power.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  BEFORE THE MARCH 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS IN 
MADRID, THE DRAMA OF THE MARCH 14 SPANISH NATIONAL ELECTIONS 
CAMPAIGN CENTERED ON WHETHER PRESIDENT AZNAR\'S POPULAR PARTY 
AND ITS CANDIDATE MARIANO RAJOY, WOULD WIN ENOUGH SEATS IN 
PARLIAMENT TO GOVERN WITH AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY (REFTEL). 
OVER THE LAST WEEK OF THE CAMPAIGN, BEFORE IT WAS SUSPENDED 
YESTERDAY BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS, SPANISH SOCIALIST (PSOE) 
CANDIDATE JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ ZAPATERO HAD BEGUN IN EARNEST 
TO EXPLOIT POPULAR OPPOSITION TO AZNAR\'S IRAQ POLICY. 
THE BOMBINGS MARCH 11, HOWEVER, WILL NOW PUT THE RACE IN A

CARRIED OUT THE ATTACKS, THE PP MAY GAIN VOTES AND POSSIBLY

ON ETA.  IF VOTERS WHO WERE ALREADY PRONE TO OPPOSE THE PP\'S 
FOREIGN POLICY BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS AN AL-QAEDA LINK TO THE 
ATTACKS, WE MAY SEE A SURGE OF SUPPORT FOR THE SOCIALIST 
PARTY.  THE ATTACKS MAY PROMPT A LARGE VOTER TURNOUT, WHICH 
COULD BOOST THE SOCIALIST VOTE COUNT.  MEANWHILE, THE SPANISH 
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS HAS PROVISIONALLY APPROVED PRESIDENT 
AZNAR\'S VICTIM COMPENSATION PLAN AND WILL SEND TO KING JUAN 
CARLOS HIS PROPOSAL TO GRANT SPANISH NATIONALITY TO 
IMMIGRANTS WHO DIED IN THE ATTACKS REGARDLESS OF THEIR 
IMMIGRATION STATUS, AS WELL AS THEIR CHILDREN AND PARENTS. 
SPANIARDS ARE GATHERING IN THE THOUSANDS IN THE RAIN IN 
MADRID THE EVENING OF MARCH 12 IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE VICTIMS 
OF THE MARCH 11 ATTACKS. END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) THE GOS REMAINS CONVINCED ETA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
MARCH 11 ATTACKS ON COMMUTER TRAINS THAT KILLED 198 PEOPLE AT 
LATEST COUNT AND INJURED OVER 1400.  BUT THE DISCOVERY OF A 
VAN WITH DETONATORS AND AN ARABIC TAPE WITH KORAN VERSES HAS 
MUDDIED THE WATERS AND HAS BEGUN TO CAST DOUBT IN THE MINDS 
OF SOME VOTERS THAT ETA WAS RESPONSIBLE. 

4. (C) SOCIALIST CANDIDATE ZAPATERO SAID MARCH 12 THAT THE 
\"POLITICAL RESPONSE\" TO THE ATTACKS SHOULD BE DIFFERENT 
DEPENDING ON WHETHER ETA OR ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS PERPETRATED 
THE BOMBINGS.  ZAPATERO\'S REMARKS IMPLIED THE SPANISH 
ELECTORATE SHOULD VOTE AGAINST THE PP GOVERNMENT MARCH 14 IF 
IT IS DETERMINED ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS WERE RESPONSIBLE, TAPPING 
INTO A THEME WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO HEAR HERE THAT THE 
AZNAR GOVERNMENT\'S SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQ COALITION PUT SPAIN 
IN THE LINE OF ISLAMIC EXTREMIST FIRE. 
 
5. (C) IN ADDITION, PSOE NATIONAL COORDINATOR JOSE BLANCO 
CLAIMED TO THE PRESS (WITH NO APPARENT EVIDENCE) MARCH 12 
THAT THE AZNAR GOVERNMENT WAS HIDING INFORMATION ON THE 
ATTACKS IN AN EFFORT TO AVERT A NEGATIVE REACTION BY THE 
ELECTORATE BEFORE THE SUNDAY ELECTIONS. 
 
6.  (C) IF THE ELECTORATE BELIEVES THAT ETA AUTHORED THE 
ATTACKS MAY TIP THE SCALES IN FAVOR OF THE PP, AND PROVIDE 
THE ABSOLUTE MAJORITY IT HAS BEEN SEEKING.  BUT IF ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION EMERGES OVER THE WEEKEND SUGGESTING ISLAMIC 
EXTREMISTS WERE THE AUTHORS -- OR PREVIOUSLY UNDECIDED VOTERS 
BELIEVE THE ISLAMIC EXTREMIST CONNECTION -- PSOE MAY WIN 
LARGER-THAN-ANTICIPATED NUMBERS OF VOTES IN SOLIDARITY FOR 
ITS OPPOSITION TO AZNAR\'S IRAQ POLICY. 
 
7.  (C)  COMMENT:  BY LAW, POLLING ON SPANISH NATIONAL 
ELECTIONS CLOSED ON MONDAY, MARCH 9, ALMOST A WEEK AHEAD OF 
THE ELECTIONS.  BOTH RAJOY AND ZAPATERO MARCH 11 DECLARED A 
SUSPENSION OF THE LAST DAYS OF THEIR CAMPAIGNS, MAKING IT 
DIFFICULT TO GAUGE POPULAR SENTIMENTS AFTER THE ATTACK BASED 
ON ANY STATISTICAL DATA ON VOTER REACTIONS.  IF THE SITUATION 
REMAINS AS IT IS AT PRESENT -- WITH THE GOS ASSERTING ETA WAS 
RESPONSIBLE, BUT SOME FACTS CREATING SOME CONCERN ABOUT AN 
ISLAMIC EXTREMIST CONNECTION, THE PP MAY STILL WIN BUT MIGHT 
NOT ACHIEVE THE ABSOLUTE MAJORITY.  IF VOTERS COME TO BELIEVE 
IN AN ISLAMIC EXTREMIST CONNECTION (WHETHER CONFIRMED OR 
NOT), THE SOCIALISTS COULD DENY THE PP A GOVERNING MAJORITY. 
BY SEPTEL, EMBASSY WILL REPORT ON POSSIBLE COALITION 
SCENARIOS.

SUBJECT: SPANISH ELECTIONS: MARCH 11 ATTACKS/ALLEGED 
AL-QAEDA LINK KEY TO POPULAR PARTY DEFEAT 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Carol Urban per 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
Summary 
 
1.  (C) The Socialist Party, turning the tables on all 
pre-March 11 polls, soundly defeated the Popular Party in 
March 14 national elections.   Reaction to the March 11 
terror attacks proved to be the decisive factor.   Massive 
but solemn anti-terror marches March 12 saw 11 million 
Spaniards take to the streets.   These were followed March 13 
by angry protests against the PP following arrests of 
suspects possibly linked to al Qaeda, reigniting large-scale 
opposition to GOS support for the Iraq war.  Protesters also 
accused the government of covering up information and of 
misleadingly attributing the attack to ETA in order to avoid 
electoral fallout.   Further revelations reinforcing the 
al-Qaeda link early March 14 opened an election day marked by 
a massive voter turnout, including previously undecided 
voters and younger, first time voters.  Socialist leader 
Zapatero\'s total of 164 seats puts him only 12 seats away 
from an absolute majority, a stronger position than anyone, 
even the Socialists themselves, could have imagined a week 
ago.   Zapatero stated March 15 that he would not seek a 
formal coalition with other parties, but would form a 
minority government, working out agreements on legislation 
with other parties on a case by case basis.   End Summary. 
 
The Results 
 
2.  (U) The Socialists (PSOE) received 164 seats in the 
Congress of Deputies, a gain of 39 seats from 2000.   The 
Popular Party, meanwhile, lost 35 seats, dropping from an 
absolute majority of 183 down to 148.    Voter turnout was 
77%, an 8.5% increase over 2000.   Seat totals follow: 
 
Socialist Party - 164 
Popular Party     - 148 
Catalan Nationalist (CiU) -   10 
Catalan Left Nationalist (ERC) -   8 
Basque Nationalist (PNV) -    7 
United Left (IU) -  5 
Others  -   8 
 
3. (U) The Socialists scored major gains in Andalusia, 
Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia.  PP results were 
down from 2000 almost nationwide.   In Andalusian regional 
elections, the Socialists surged to regain an absolute 
majority in a region they have controlled for the past 22 
years.   The Popular Party retained control of the Senate, 
with 102 seats to 92 for the Socialists.   However, the 
Senate is the far weaker house of Parliament, and plays no 
role in formation of the government. 
 
March 11 Terror Attacks Decisive 
 
4.  (SBU) No poll conducted before March 8 (the last legal 
date for publishing of new polls) came close to predicting 
the 164-seat total for the Socialists.   The absolute maximum 
range in the most optimistic poll gave the PSOE 144 seats. 
In contrast, a CIS poll, believed to be the most accurate and 
indicative, gave the PP an absolute majority of 177 seats. 
 
5. (C) The March 11 terror attacks changed all calculations, 
especially as possible links to al Qaeda surfaced.  Most 
significant were the arrests in Madrid of five suspects on 
March 13, several allegedly linked to Al Qaeda, and the 
release of a video tape reputed to be from al Qaeda claiming 
responsibility and promising more attacks if Spain continues 
to participate in the coalition in Iraq.   Media and the 
Socialists claimed that the GOS was withholding information 
that might implicate al Qaeda in the attacks for fear of 
electoral consequences.    They also accused the GOS of 
falsely attributing the attacks to ETA. 
 
Vote of Fear, and to Punish the PP 
 
6.  (C) The massive mobilization of the population in 
nationwide anti-terrorism marches March 12, when over 11 
million Spaniards took to the streets, presaged a near record 
election day turnout March 14.    This large voter turnout 
clearly favored the Socialists.   Evidence of possible al 
Qaeda links to the March 11 attacks reignited massive popular 
opposition to the Iraq war.   Aznar and PP candidate Rajoy 
were blamed for having implicated Spain in what the 
Socialists have continually termed an illegal and immoral 
conflict.   This, to many, had made Spain a target. 
Zapatero\'s relentless anti-war and anti-President Bush 
rhetoric, and his pledge to get Spanish troops out of Iraq by 
June 30 if the mission is not turned over to the UN by that 
date, resonated. 
 
7. (C)  The accusation of \"lies\" also surfaced strongly, 
particularly in the pro-PSOE Prisa media group, which 
includes El Pais.   A typical line was: the Aznar government 
lied about WMD in getting Spain involved in an illegal war, 
now it is lying about al Qaeda links to March 11.  This line 
echoed Zapatero\'s plea to voters to use their vote to punish 
the PP for implicating Spain in the war.   As former 
Socialist President Felipe Gonzalez said: a vote for the PP 
is a vote for the war in Iraq. 
 
A Minority Government, Without Formal Coalition Partners 
 
8.  (C)  Zapatero\'s 164 seats puts him only 12 seats from an 
absolute majority, more seats than even the most optimistic 
pre-March 11 prediction of his own party.   Zapatero said on 
March 15 that he intended not to seek a formal coalition with 
other parties but to run a minority Socialist government and 
to work agreements on specific legislation on a case by case 
basis.    On election night, the moderate Catalan nationalist 
CiU party had already indicated it would like to enter into 
negotiations for a pact with the PSOE.   A pact with the PSOE 
for a \"Government of the Left\" was a central element in the 
campaign of the IU (left/communists).   The radical Catalan 
republican nationalist ERC have indicated they could also 
support the PSOE, as they do in Catalonia.   Other 
nationalists, such as the moderate Basque nationalist PNV may 
abstain or, possibly, even vote in favor of PSOE. 
Zapatero\'s investiture thus appears assured.   Since 
Zapatero\'s government will not have an absolute majority, he 
will be invested on a second round with a simple majority. 
Zapatero should be in office by late April. 
 
(U) Other Election Results: 
 
ERC - Catalan Left Nationalists: jumped from one to eight 
seats.    This is despite (or because of) fact that ERC 
leader Carod Rovira caused a furor by meeting with ETA 
leaders in France in January. 
 
CIU - Moderate Catalan nationalists: Dropped from 15 to 10 
seats.   (ERC believed to have picked these seats up.) 
 
IU - Communist/Left:  Dropped from 9 seats to 5.    The 
Socialists had appealed to IU voters to vote PSOE so their 
vote would count more.    This appeal to a \"useful vote\" 
worked.    IU had 21 seats in 1996, so the decline is steep. 
 
PNV - Moderate Basque Nationalists:  Held to their 7 seats. 
PNV leader Imaz has signaled he would like to dialogue with 
Zapatero to improve the climate in relations between Madrid 
and the PNV.

SUBJECT: SPANISH FOREIGN POLICY UNDER NEW SOCIALIST 
GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: 03 MADRID 4496 
 
Classified By: Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Carol J. Urban, 
reasons 1.4(B) and (D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Well before the  March 14 general 
elections, Socialist Workers\' Party of Spain (PSOE) leader 
Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapatero made clear that if elected he 
would refocus Spanish foreign policy away from the primacy of 
the transatlantic link and toward Spain,s traditional EU 
partners such as France and Germany.  On Iraq, Zapatero has 
long said that he would withdraw Spanish troops by June 30 if 
they were not under what he perceived to be an adequate UN 
mandate.  He reiterated March 15, the day after he became 
President-elect, that Spanish troops would withdraw from Iraq 
before the June European Parliamentary elections if the 
international situation regarding Iraq had not changed. 
Since the March 11 attacks and the March 14 elections, 
Zapatero has said that his highest priority would be to 
continue the fight against terrorism.  During the campaign, 
on March 4, Zapatero had announced that he would ask former 
EU Middle East envoy and veteran Spanish diplomat Miguel 
Angel Moratinos to serve as his foreign minister; Moratinos 
in recent speeches has echoed Zapatero,s foreign policy 
approach, as has PSOE,s foreign policy spokesman in 
parliament, Manuel Marin.  (Zapatero has not confirmed 
Moratinos\'  appointment; Marin is another possible candidate 
for foreign minister.  His views are exactly the same as 
those of Zapatero and Moratinos.)  Although Spain under the 
Socialists will remain an ally of the U.S., Zapatero will 
distance Spain from the very close relations the U.S. enjoyed 
under the Aznar government.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
\"Spain in Europe and With Europe\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Zapatero has stated on numerous occasions that if he 
were to become President, he would refocus Spain\'s foreign 
policy on its relations with Europe in the EU.  After winning 
the March 14 election, Zapatero said one of his foreign 
policy priorities would be to regain the \"confidence of 
European governments in Spain as a reliable partner\" in EU 
integration.  Moratinos echoed this in a March 10 speech, 
saying PSOE\'s \"absolute priority\" in foreign policy would be 
to recover the \"weight and influence\" it lost in the EU under 
Aznar. 
 
3.  (C) Within this priority, a primary goal will be to reach 
consensus on a new European constitution.  Moratinos stated 
that Spain\'s objective should be to \"integrate and construct\" 
Europe, not separate it and block agreements (referring to 
Aznar\'s refusal to agree to an EU constitution that diluted 
Spain\'s voting weight).  A Socialist government, said 
Moratinos, would work to reach agreement on an EU 
constitution by May 1, or at the latest by year\'s end.  Spain 
should return from the \"periphery\" of the EU and instead form 
part of the \"nucleus\" of countries seeking to construct the 
EU. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
U.S. Relations: \"Respect and Friendship, Not Submission\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
4.  (C) Zapatero has pledged to conduct a transatlantic 
dialog based on \"respect and friendship, not submission\" 
(reftel).  PSOE officials for some time have argued that 
President Aznar deferred inordinately to the United States. 
Moratinos repeated Zapatero\'s view March 10 and advocated a 
new strategic alliance with the U.S. aimed at ensuring \"just 
globalization,\" and grounded in the \"equal sovereignty\" of 
both countries.  Graphically, Moratinos said a Zapatero 
government would cut Spain out of the photo of the \"Trio of 
the Azores\" (referring to last year\'s meeting in the Azores 
of Bush, Aznar and Blair) and return Spain to the political 
axis of the EU. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Iraq: Spanish Troops Recalled Unless UN in Control 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5.  (C) Before the election Zapatero called the Iraq war 
\"illegal\" and \"immoral.\"  He promised to bring Spanish troops 
home unless the UN was in control in Iraq by June 30 (he was 
unclear about what kind of UN control was necessary, but at a 
minimum he would want a UNSC resolution authorizing troop 
presence).  He and PSOE party operatives have reiterated this 
pledge since winning the election; on March 15 Zapatero said 
Spanish troops would leave Iraq before the European 
Parliamentary elections in June if the \"international 
situation\" regarding troop presence does not change.    And 
in his March 10 speech, Moratinos said Spain\'s participation 
in the Iraq war and the stationing of its troops there 
afterward exemplified the \"rupture\" of the Spanish model of 
foreign policy by consensus.  He said Spain\'s troops would 
remain in Iraq only if the international community gives the 
UN the authority necessary to guide Iraq to a new government 
freely elected by Iraqis.  More broadly, Moratinos said 
Spain\'s role in the Iraq war damaged Spain\'s relations with 
Arab countries, and a Socialist government would work to 
repair those relations. 
 
6.  (C) It is possible the new PSOE government will feel 
substantial pressure from the Spanish public to bring the 
troops home after June 30 regardless of whether there is a 
new UN mandate.  Socialist successes in the March 14 
elections were due in large part to the public\'s frustration 
with PP Iraq policy and fear that Spain,s support for the 
coalition made it a target of terrorists. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Closer Relations with Latin America 
----------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Moratinos has also said the Aznar government 
subordinated Spanish relations with Latin America to its 
relations with the U.S.  Latin America, stated Moratinos, is 
Spain\'s natural foreign policy partner.  Relations with Latin 
America should be conducted separately from relations with 
the U.S., to the extent possible. 
 
------------------- 
A Look At Moratinos 
------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Moratinos, 52 years old, is a more than 30-year 
veteran of the diplomatic service.  He is also a lawyer. 
Among other posts he has served in the former Yugoslavia and 
Morocco, and was Spain\'s Ambassador to Israel for 
approximately six months in 1996.  In December 1996, the EU 
named Moratinos its Special Representative for the Middle 
East Peace Process, a position he held until June 2003. 
Nearly all of his domestic assignments were connected to 
northern Africa or the Arab world.  A fluent English speaker, 
Moratinos is married to the French Dominique Maunac.  They 
have three children. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) Particularly in the wake of the March 11 attacks, 
Spaniards will expect Zapatero to distance Spain rapidly from 
the close relations Aznar cultivated with the Bush 
Administration.  Zapatero owes his victory to the Spanish 
reaction to those attacks; many Spaniards blame the attacks 
on Aznar\'s pro-U.S. policy on Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Nonetheless, before the March 14 election, party insiders 
took pains to convince us that a Zapatero government would 
build and maintain strong, positive relations with the U.S., 
despite Zapatero\'s campaign rhetoric.   We believe that a 
PSOE government would want to maintain positive ties with the 
US and remind us that US-Spain relations were excellent under 
12 years of PSOE government in the late 1970,s-1980,s. 
But at least in the short term, Zapatero will feel pressure 
to back away from close cooperation with the U.S. on Iraq, 
and may also feel the need to demonstrate clearly to the 
Spanish electorate he will not kow-tow to the U.S., as he 
claims Aznar did.

PRESIDENT-ELECT 
 
REF: MADRID 880 
 
1.  (SBU) On March 14, the Spanish Workers Socialist Party 
(PSOE) led by Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero defeated the 
incumbent Popular Party (PP), in Spain\'s general elections 
(see reftel for discussion of election results).  Zapatero 
should be in place as President of the government by late 
April. 
 
2.  (SBU) Zapatero was born on August 6, 1960 in Valladolid 
(the capital of the Autonomous Community of Castilla-Leon) 
and comes from a left-leaning background.  He is the grandson 
of a republican captain who as executed by Nationalists at 
the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.  Zapatero was 
granted military deferments due to his law studies and has 
not served in the military.  He has devoted almost his entire 
adult life to politics.  Today, Zapatero is considered a 
center-left, social democrat. 
 
3.  (SBU) Zapatero joined PSOE in the city of Leon in 1979 
and became the leader of its youth wing in 1982.  By 1986, he

youngest representative elected to Congress.  Between 1989 
and 1993, Zapatero served as PSOE-Leon,s Regional Secretary. 
 He was appointed to its Federal Executive Committee in 1994. 
 In 1997, after President Felipe Gonzales resigned as PSOE 
party leader, Zapatero was seen as the \"next generation\" of 
the Spanish Socialist Party.  After the Socialists were 
defeated in Spain\'s 2000 general elections, Zapatero 
presented himself as candidate for PSOE Secretary General. 
In 2000, he defeated Socialist Party \"baron\" Jose Bono and 
two other candidates to become PSOE Secretary General and 
leader of opposition in Congress. 
 
4.  (SBU) Zapatero holds a law degree and was Professor of 
Constitutional Law at the University of Leon.  He married 
Sonsoles Espinosa in 1988 and has two daughters. 
 
5.  (SBU) Zapatero speaks rudimentary English.  He neither 
smokes nor drinks.  He enjoys jogging, fishing, soccer and 
poetry.

SUBJECT: MADRID MARCH 11 BOMB ATTACKS: STATUS OF 
INVESTIGATION 
 
Classified By: Carol Urban, Acting Deputy Chief of Mission, for Reasons 
 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) The investigation into who perpetrated the March 11 
attacks in Madrid continues, with an Al Qaeda link looking 
increasingly likely.  While authorities cannot completely 
rule out responsibility by the terrorist group ETA, or a 
possible ETA role in coordination with an Islamic terrorist 
group, the current major line of investigation is Al Qaeda. 
 
2. (C) Spanish authorities have detained five suspects, three 
Moroccan and two Indian citizens.  All three Moroccans are 
said to have links to Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, who was 
indicted for his role as an alleged ringleader in Al Qaeda\'s 
organization in Spain.   Authorities have reportedly linked 
the three to the attacks as a result of tracing the cell 
phone (the method used for detonation in the attacks) from 
one of the sportsbag bombs that did not detonate.  The three 
Moroccans are Kamal ZOUGAM (other reported spelling: Kamal 
ZOUGAN)(DPOB: 05-OCT-1973, Tangiers, Morocco); Mohamed EL 
BEKKALI BOUTALIHA (DPOB: 05-JUN-1969, Achouta, Morocco); and 
Mohamed CHAQUI (other reported spelling: Mohamed 
CHAOUI)(DPOB: 26-JUN-1969, Tangiers, Morocco).  All 
reportedly have police records and Zougam was named in 
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon\'s September 2003 indictment of 
Barakat Yarkas, though not indicted himself.  Zougam 
reportedly ran an internet cafe with Chaqui, his half-brother. 
 
3. (C) The two Indians arrested are Vinay KHOLY (other 
reported spelling: Vinay KOHLY)(DPOB: 11-JUN-1976, Jalandhar, 
India) and Suresh KAMAR (DPOB: 27-JAN-1972, Hoshiarpur, 
India).  Press sources say they sold the telephones to the 
detained Moroccans. 
 
4. (C) On March 13, Spanish authorities were advised of a 
videotape placed in a trash container near a prominent 
mosque, located near the major M-30 roadway in Madrid.  The 
tape purportedly shows a masked spokesman, going by the name 
of Abu Dujan AL AFGANI, who claims responsibility for the 
attacks on behalf of Al Qaeda\'s military group in Europe. 
The man reportedly speaks Arabic with a Moroccan accent. 
Newspaper accounts state that high-level Moroccan security 
officials will travel to Spain to aid in the investigation. 
 
5. (C) The Madrid Community Government reports that as of 
today, the death toll from the attacks stands at 200.  They 
also list a total of 1,647 people treated for injuries, with 
243 victims still hospitalized.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SP, PSOE - Socialist Party, Spanish Election March 2004 
SUBJECT: FORMATION OF THE NEW SPANISH GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: MADRID 613 
 
1. (U) Summary.  Spain\'s parliamentary system is flexible on 
exact dates for installing governments after a general 
election, but given historical timeframes, Socialist leader 
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero should be invested as President 
of the Government by the end of April or the beginning of 
May.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) In the aftermath of the March 14 elections, the 
process of installing the newly elected Socialist government 
will begin on April 2.  This is the date when the incoming 
members of the Congress of Deputies will choose the President 
of the Congress and the members of the \"table\" (committee), 
who will conduct the acts where the Deputies swear their 
allegiance to the Constitution.  Within 15 days, by April 17, 
the President of the Congress will convene the Congress of 
Deputies and hold its first session. 
 
3.  (U) When Congress is convened, the process of coalition 
building begins.  At the end of these inter-party 
negotiations, the President of the Congress and the King 
propose a candidate for the office of President of the 
Government.  That candidate, who will assuredly be Zapatero, 
will then address Congress detailing his political agenda, 
and the Congress will vote on his investiture.  Although 
Zapatero has stated that he will not seek a formal coalition 
with other parties, three parties (the United Left, the ERC 
(leftist Catalan nationalists), and the Canary Islands 
Coalition) have already signaled that they will vote for his 
investiture.  Their support would insure that Zapatero 
receives more than the 176 votes needed for an absolute 
majority.  There is no required date for an investiture vote. 
 If for any reason Zapatero would not receive the required 
176 votes for an absolute majority, he would return to the 
Congress within 48 hours for a second vote, in which he would 
only need a simple majority. 
 
4. (U) Once invested, Zapatero will present his government to 
the King the following day.  This presentation to the King 
will be the first official naming of his Ministers and 
advisors.  With historic timelines as a guide, the new 
Socialist government should be officially in power by late 
April or early May.  Reftel provides further information on 
this subject and other details of the Spanish electoral 
process.

1. (C) Information from official sources remains limited due 
to the secrecy order issued by the judge presiding over the 
investigation, Judge Juan del Olmo.  LegAtt Office will 
request further information through our mutual legal 
assistance treaty, but receipt of information as a result of 
that request may take 10 days or more.  A major development 
to date has been the receipt by the Legatt\'s Office of 
fingerprints from the five suspects previously detained (see 
reftel) and latent prints from a van near one of the crime 
scenes that contained detonators.  LegAtt Office has 
transmitted those prints to Washington for review. 
 
2. (U) Press sources report that four more suspects were 
detained on Wednesday night or Thursday morning in connection 
with the investigation.  All four are believed to be of 
Moroccan origin.  One of those suspects is reported to be a 
man also sought by authorities for his involvement in the May 
2003 bombings that killed 33 people in Casablanca. 
 
3. (U) An Algerian man is also in custody to determine if he 
had previous knowledge of the Madrid attacks.  Press sources 
say that the Algerian suspect, Ali AMROUS, had made comments 
to Basque region police during a January altercation that 
terrorist groups would fill the Castellana (a major Madrid 
street) and the Atocha train station with dead.  A total of

1. (C) Summary.  Spain will be putting terrorism at the top 
of its agenda for the March 22-23 EU FMS meetings and the 
March 25-26 European Council meetings.  Jointly with the 
Dutch, Spain will be backing the creation of a EU Coordinator 
for anti-terrorism efforts.  The MFA\'s EU Office also expects 
the investiture of the new Socialist government to proceed 
quickly and to have Miguel Angel Moratinos installed as the 
new Foreign Minister by as early as April 15.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Terrorism and Terrorist Financing 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) We delivered reftel demarche on March 18 to Enrique 
Mora, Director of the MFA\'s Office of EU Foreign Policy and 
Common Security.  On terrorist financing, Mora stated that 
Spain shares the USG\'s concern about the amount of time it 
takes to designate terrorists through the EU Clearinghouse 
(Spain has been working actively with the Dutch and some 
other EU states to reform the process).  He said that Spain 
sees the need for a single EU Coordinator for anti-terrorism 
efforts, which he likened to Secretary Ridge\'s position in 
the Department of Homeland Security.  He said that Spain and 
the Netherlands would jointly introduce a measure creating 
this position, but that he expected that United Kingdom 
representatives may disagree, as the British have been 
reluctant to streamline the process of designating terrorists. 
 
3. (C) Mora also stated that there would be a discussion on 
whether the EU should implement its Solidarity Clause in 
response to the Madrid bombings and ban trade with any 
government that is judged to not be combating terrorism.  He 
said that such a ban could affect several North African 
countries, especially in light of the events in Madrid. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Iran, Serbia and the Middle East 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Regarding Iran, Mora stated that the EU ministers 
would be calling for Iran to put its recent promises in 
writing.  He said Spain still believes in dialog with Iran, 
but that the most recent statements by the Iranian government 
on allowing inspections must be put into signed agreements. 
 
5. (C) On Serbian and Croatian cooperation with the ICTY, 
Mora said that Spain agrees that there must be a strong line 
urging cooperation with the tribunals.  However, he did not 
foresee any changes in the CARDS budget linked to cooperation. 
 
6. (C) Mora did not see any conclusions being agreed to at 
this meeting with regard to possible Israeli plans for 
unilateral disengagement.  He noted the USG\'s position that 
the peace process should be pursued parallel to the Greater 
Middle East Initiative, and that progress on one should not 
be linked to progress on the other. However, he mentioned 
that he thought it would be hard for the Arab states to not 
see movement on the Greater Middle East Initiative as 
contingent on progress on Israeli/Palestinian issues. 
 
---------------------------- 
New Foreign Minister 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) As is commonly believed, Mora said he expected the new 
Socialist government to name Miguel Angel Moratinos Cuyaube 
as its Foreign Minister.  He noted that Moratinos is a 
\"Middle East expert\", having served as the EU\'s Special 
Representative for the Middle East Peace Process from the end 
of 1996 to mid-2003, and as Spain\'s Ambassador to Israel for 
six months prior to the EU appointment.  Mora thought that 
the new government could be invested and working by as early 
as April 14.

SUBJECT: DEALING WITH ZAPATERO:  AN INEXPERIENCED BUT 
PROBABLY MANAGEABLE PARTNER 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador George Argyros for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  This message provides initial embassy 
thinking on how to deal with President-Elect Zapatero in the 
lead up to his government\'s formation and the early stages of 
his administration.   Zapatero has no experience in 
administration or foreign affairs.  He is likely to be a 
difficult but manageable interlocutor and carries with him 
the Spanish Left\'s skepticism of U.S. motives.  Opposition to 
the war in Iraq is central to Zapatero,s appeal to voters. 
Nonetheless a UNSCR that gave the UN a leading role in the 
Iraq mission could allow Zapatero to save face and agree to 
maintain Spanish forces in Iraq.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) Some things to bear in mind 
 
--It is important to recall that Zapatero, who is 43, has no 
experience whatsoever in government administration.  He has 
served as a member of the Parliament since he was 26. 
 
--The Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) was shocked that 
they won the elections and Zapatero and his people are 
scrambling to figure out what to do.  He also made a number 
of campaign statements that might have come out differently 
had he thought he had a real chance of becoming president of 
the government of Spain. 
 
--As leader of Spain, Zapatero will be able to draw on some 
experienced PSOE party operatives and experienced diplomats 
and economists such as Miguel Angel Moratinos and Miguel 
Sebastian.  But he will also have to make certain he does not 
provoke the image that he is replaying the corrupt government 
of Felipe Gonzalez, the PSOE President of Spain from 
1982-1996.   So his team likely will include a mix of 
experienced people and newer and less experienced hands.  The 
learning curve will be steep.   Zapatero and his team will 
have a certain settling in period once the reality of 
government sets in. 
 
--We have already seen some \'wiggle room\' in public 
statements on certain issues, including possibly on the pull 
out of Spanish troops from Iraq.  Zapatero,s possible 
foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos indicated in the 
March 18 Wall Street Journal that a UN resolution prior to 
June 30 could provide the context in which Spanish troops 
could remain.  If by May we are beginning to negotiate a 
resolution and if France and Germany are on board, Zapatero 
might agree to leave the troops in Iraq. 
 
--Zapatero will have to work to dispel the image that he won 
because he will appease terrorists (or that he was elected by 
Al-Qaeda).  He will almost certainly hear from his European 
colleagues on this issue.  He will have to calibrate his 
decisions to avoid the impression that terrorists can 
influence his foreign policy moves. 
 
--Though terrorism and foreign policy are now front and 
center for Zapatero, many Spaniards believe his main 
challenge will be handling the increasingly vocal nationalist 
tendencies in Catalonia and the Basque region, which could 
threaten the Spanish constitutional order.  Zapatero does not 
have the gravitas nor the credibility to deal with these 
issues effectively, many fear.  It is not in the U.S. 
interest to see instability in the Spanish national system. 
 
--Under Zapatero, Spain will continue to face a terrorist 
threat, both from Al-Qaeda and from ETA.  This is our most 
significant common challenge, on which we should seek to 
build a firm relationship. 
 
--On macro-economic issues, we can expect sound policies. 
The PSOE initiated many of the reforms which laid the basis 
for Spain,s current economic success, and Zapatero himself 
has credited the success of Aznar,s economic policies in the 
past.  Zapatero has already endorsed PP Minister of Economy 
Rato to head the IMF.  There are continued grounds for 
cooperation in this area. 
 
--The USG has worked well with previous socialist 
governments.  Under Felipe Gonzalez, Spain reaffirmed its 
membership in NATO, despite the Socialists, previous 
opposition to NATO membership.  We negotiated a renewal of 
our bilateral defense agreements.  There is a positive 
history with PSOE on which to build. 
 
--We will have to accept that there are some issues on which 
we will disagree with the Zapatero government.  Zapatero,s 
political philosophy, and that of his closest associates, is 
grounded in the European Left,s reflexive skepticism about 
U.S. motives at best, and anti-Americanism at worst. 
 
--We have long-term interests in Spain that transcend 
governments in power.  Spain is a NATO ally, a strong and 
growing economic force in the EU with shared common 
historical and linguistic links with the Americas.  Knowledge 
of and ties with the U.S., however, remain quite thin. 
Zapatero has little understanding of the U.S. 
 
--Spanish democracy is still rather immature - less than 30 
years old.  The high voter turnout last week was a victory 
for democracy in Spain.  We should avoid castigating Spanish 
voters and allow them to come to their own conclusions about 
the government that they have elected, albeit under 
extraordinary circumstances. 
 
3.  (C) Our overall approach 
 
--We believe it is in U.S. interest, both for relations with 
Spain and more broadly in Europe and in the Iraq Coalition 
that we allow Zapatero some time before we come to 
conclusions about steps he will take, including on Iraq. 
 
--The public line the White House and the Department have 
thus far taken, for example in the White House and Department 
briefings of March 16, is working and we can already see it 
resonating through opinion pieces in Spanish media.  This 
will help us avoid an unhelpful U.S.-vs- Zapatero image that 
may be difficult to dispel later on when some rapprochement 
might be possible or needed by us or Spain for other reasons. 
 
--Rather, we should emphasize our long-term interests in and 
alliance with Spain, our good relations with the previous 
PSOE government, our shared interest combating terrorism, the 
strength of our economic relations and our shared interest in 
repairing strained transatlantic relations (the theme here is 
that Zapatero need not choose between Europe and the United 
States). 
 
--We should allow other European leaders to express their 
concerns to Zapatero about the appearance of giving in to 
terrorism.   The views of France and Germany carry particular 
weight with Zapatero.  We should offer our support and advice 
in the effort against terrorism, and should continue to do so 
at the highest levels. 
 
--We should also emphasize that transatlantic relations and 
close ties with Europe are not either/or propositions.  The 
U.S. strongly supports European integration and enlargement. 
 
4.  (C) It will be important that the USG seek to engage 
Zapatero and his new team at senior levels as soon as 
possible, and continue practical areas of U.S. - Spanish 
cooperation that are outside of the difficult issues such as 
Iraq. 
 
Some suggested practical steps: 
 
--Secretary Powell connect with probable PSOE Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos as soon as possible. 
 
--Presidential letter to Zapatero as soon as he is invested 
(probably in late April); second congratulatory phone call as 
soon as he is in office. 
 
--Offer high-level intelligence briefing to Zapatero on 
counter-terrorism and other key world issues. 
 
--Suggest that Zapatero would be welcome in Washington as 
soon as he is able to visit. 
 
--Engage at high levels on counter-terrorism cooperation, 
with a visit by Secretary Ridge to meet with his counterpart 
(under new ministry name of Ministry of Security) once the 
new government is invested, and follow up at other levels 
immediately. 
 
--Suggest regular high-level and working-level consultations 
with new MFA on key issues - Middle East, Latin America, UN 
Security Council issues, human rights, common threats and 
challenges.  Public diplomacy outreach the primacy and 
breadth of the U.S. - EU relationship will also be important. 
 
--Defense issues:  Spain reaffirmed its membership in NATO 
under PSOE government.  We should continue our good level of 
defense dialogue, contacts, and cooperation, including in the 
Balkans and Afghanistan; dialogue on Iraq if we get a new UN 
resolution.  Continue \"business as usual\" with 
military-military contacts. 
 
--Terrorism Finance:  The events of March 11 represent an 
opportunity to persuade Spain to take a greater leadership 
role on these issues in the EU and elsewhere, particularly in 
terms of assistance.  Spain had proposed hosting a terrorism 
finance conference early this year.  We should convey our 
willingness to support such a conference should the 
government wish to do so.  We should also continue our 
willingness to consider Spain for standing membership in the 
CTAG. 
 
--Iraq Contracts:  The Spanish private sector continues to 
show interest in and frustration with the contracting 
process.  We believe Spanish companies have a lot to offer. 
We recommend going ahead with tentative plans to have the 
CPA,s Program Management Office (PMO) brief on 
subcontracting (sponsored by a private sector entity) in late 
April as currently planned.  It will demonstrate the possible 
benefits of cooperation. 
 
--Trade Issues:  We recommend signaling to the new trade team 
a willingness to consult on the Doha Round and progress in 
the FTAA - a likely area of continued interest for the new 
government. 
 
--Housing:  Zapatero has already signaled that housing will 
be a key issue for his government and has already said he 
will create a housing ministry.  Based on the U.S.-Spain 
Housing forums which took place under former HUD Secretary 
Martinez, leadership with the Ministry of Public Works 
(where housing currently stands) suggest a dialogue with HUD 
as soon as this ministry is established, building on ties 
already created, many of which at the working level will 
remain. 
 
--R&D/S&T/Productivity:  There is a wide scope for increased 
R&D cooperation given that the PSOE platform included a 
pledge to significantly increase the amount of R&D spending. 
Along the same lines, improving worker productivity is 
another key PSOE pledge.  As a leader in this area, U.S. may 
be able to share experiences with the new government. 
 
5.    (C) Possible PSOE response 
 
--Zapatero likely will prove an inexperienced partner.  There 
are a number of issues on which he will clearly differ from 
Aznar, but there are areas on which we can build on long-term 
cooperative efforts. 
 
What will change 
 
 
--From the PSOE side, we can expect some initial reservations 
about our engagement overtures.  But as the reality of 
government sets in, Zapatero and his team may welcome a 
matter of fact approach from us focused on practical steps in 
areas on which we can agree. 
 
--Zapatero,s European focus will be a key element of his 
foreign policy.  He has made it clear he intends to follow 
the lines of France and Germany on most issues.  He has 
already said that he will drop Aznar,s insistence in the EU 
constitution debate on maintaining the Nice treaty voting 
formulas.  Again, though, as Zapatero realizes he is 
governing one of Europe,s fastest growing economies, he will 
quickly find that on some issues Spain will want to have a 
voice that is separate from those of France and Germany.  But 
as our relationship with France and Germany evolves, we may 
find areas of opportunity with Spain under PSOE as well.

1.  (C) Summary:  The Socialist Workers Party of Spain 
(PSOE), surprise victor in March 14 elections, is a 
center-left party in the European social democrat tradition. 
Since the end of the Franco regime and the beginning of 
Spain\'s modern democracy in 1977, PSOE has generally 
advocated comprehensive social programs and limited defense 
spending, as well as a reduced domestic role for the armed 
forces.  In practical terms, members of Zapatero\'s inner 
circle have been careful to say PSOE will make no significant 
changes to the Aznar government\'s  successful economic 
policies.  We expect static or reduced defense spending under 
PSOE, increased social welfare programs, more \"green\" 
environment policies, a greater focus on Spain\'s role in the 
EU (including increased adherence to French and German 
leadership), and distancing from the Spain\'s close 
relationship with the United States that Aznar fostered.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Mainstream Socialists 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Founded more than 120 years ago, the PSOE espouses 
as its main goals liberty, equality, solidarity and social 
justice.  Communists broke with the Socialists after the 1917 
Russian revolution and formed their own party (now the United 
Left, or IU).  PSOE renounced any connection with Marxism in 
1979, reaffirming the democratic and federal nature of the 
party.  Since the end of the Franco regime and the beginning 
of modern Spanish democracy in 1977, PSOE has advocated 
comprehensive social programs, limited defense spending and a 
reduced role for the military in Spanish life. 
 
3.  (SBU) The Socialists governed Spain with Felipe Gonzalez 
as President from 1982-1996. Though the Socialists lost power 
in 1996 amidst a swirl of corruption scandals, Gonzalez is 
credited with having strengthened the foundations of Spanish 
democracy and governmental institutions during his time as 
head of government.  Spain joined the European Community and, 
in a national referendum, reaffirmed its membership in NATO 
under Gonzalez, a position PSOE had originally opposed. 
Gonzalez called the latter a \"triumph of the people of 
Spain.\"  The Socialist government under Gonzalez also updated 
Spain\'s agreement with the United States for American use of 
Spanish military bases. 
 
--------------- 
Zapatero\'s PSOE 
--------------- 
 
4.  (C) President-elect Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero took 
over as PSOE\'s secretary general in 2000, narrowly edging out 
party \"baron\" Jose Bono.  In 2003 the party issued a 
resolution outlining its political program designed \"to 
increase freedom and the decision-making power of ordinary 
citizens over their own lives; to reduce crime; to allow 
citizens to develop their talents and abilities to the 
fullest; and to ensure individuals are not abandoned to their 
own fate.\"  Following is a summary of PSOE positions in major 
issue areas: 
 
-- Foreign Policy:  See Ref A for a discussion of PSOE\'s 
likely foreign policy goals.  PSOE\'s general foreign policy 
outlook was summarized well by Manuel Marin, the party\'s 
international affairs spokesman in Congress:  \"Aznar wanted 
to make Spain a great nation among the great nations, but 
Spain lacks the means and capacity for that role.  Spain 
cannot be a determinative force in great international 
conflicts.  We do not have the political or economic weight 
for that, nor the internal security and defense capabilities 
that would be necessary.\"  In general, we expect PSOE to 
conduct more of its foreign policy via Brussels and to hew 
closer to Franco-German positions.  Zapatero\'s comments have 
also indicated he plans to distance Spain from the close 
relations the U.S. enjoyed under the Aznar government. 
 
-- Economy:  The outlines of PSOE\'s economic platform are in 
Ref C.  Close associates of Zapatero have been careful to say 
that the incoming PSOE government will not make significant 
changes to the PP\'s successful economic policies.  Some 
business leaders have voiced the same expectations with us. 
PSOE will work to decrease unemployment (currently over 11 
percent and one of the highest in the EU) and convert jobs on 
temporary contracts (currently one-third of new jobs created) 
into permanent positions which carry full benefits. 
President-elect Zapatero has stated his government will focus 
significant attention on calming the rapid rise in housing 
prices and has already announced the creation of a Ministry 
of Housing.  The PSOE also advocates more investment in R&D 
and training for workers.  They have promised to simplify the 
tax system, resulting in decreased taxes for many Spaniards, 
while maintaining a balanced budget and fiscal discipline. 
 
-- Social Programs and Issues:  PSOE has pledged to: include 
more health services in the nation\'s health plan and reduce 
the maximum wait time for operations; increase pensions and 
improve health care for the aged; raise the minimum wage; 
lengthen legally mandated paternity leave; change the civil 
code to allow gay marriages; mandate gender-based affirmative 
action for government jobs; and devote more attention to the 
problem of domestic violence. 
 
-- Education:  Zapatero has said PSOE will lengthen the 
school day, increase bilingual education (one-third of 
classes will be taught in English), improve computer access, 
and increase grants for students who go on to higher 
education. 
 
-- Environment:  We can anticipate more \"green\" environment 
policies.  PSOE officials have made clear they plan to scrap 
the PP\'s hugely controversial north-south water transfer 
plan, replacing it with a new water policy to be based on 
better water management, increased reliance on underground 
water supplies and greater investment in desalination.  PSOE 
has pledged Spain\'s complete compliance with the Kyoto 
Protocol, despite rumblings from Spanish industry that 
emissions cuts agreed under the EU umbrella will severely and 
negatively affect competitiveness. PSOE\'s campaign platform 
called for a formal moratorium on nuclear power within five 
years, but recent pronouncements have indicated that the 
party might simply deny renewal of current licenses. 
 
5.  (C) Zapatero has not explained how he plans to pay for 
increased social programs while cutting taxes at the same 
time, except to suggest he may trim defense spending to pay 
part of the bill. His inner circle have suggested some 
revenues may come through greater government efficiencies, 
without specifying programs or jobs that would be eliminated. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) PSOE is a mainstream European socialist party. 
Although Zapatero has led PSOE for four years, he has never 
held a government position, and since PSOE has been out of 
power for eight years, neither have many of those around him 
(see Ref B for a discussion those surrounding Zapatero). 
PSOE and Zapatero will have a steep learning curve to climb 
upon taking power.  Given the need to appeal to his large 
anti-war constituency, Zapatero will distance Spanish foreign 
policy from Aznar\'s close relations with the U.S. 
Nonetheless, we are hopeful that once PSOE grasps that it has 
won and Zapatero is in office, Zapatero will come to realize 
that while he may have differences with the U.S., it is still 
in Spain\'s interest to cooperate with us on a number of 
issues.

SUBJECT: SPANISH ELECTION: POPULAR PARTY STILL IN SHOCK 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen Fitzpatrick per 1.4 (b) and 
 (d). 
 
Summary 
 
1. (C) The Popular Party remains in shock over the March 14 
election results.   The government vehemently rejects charges 
it withheld information on al Qaeda for election benefit. 
The PP accepts defeat but members complain the Socialists 
manipulated the March 11 terror attacks to turn the electoral 
tables on the PP.   The PP does not exclude working with PSOE 
on common issues such as counterterrorism and defending the 
constitutional order.    PP reps are concerned about 
Zapatero\'s pledge to withdraw troops from Iraq, but believe a 
new UN resolution might allow Zapatero to save face and keep 
the troops there.   End Summary. 
 
Accepting the Election Results 
 
2.  (C) The mood in Popular Party circles, following the PP\'s 
unexpected electoral defeat March 14, is a mixture of shock, 
depression, anger and, now that a few days have passed, 
resignation, according to PP contacts.    They make clear, 
however, as PP leader Mariano Rajoy has said in public 
statements, that the PP will not dispute the legitimacy of 
the March 14 election results.   This is despite the fact 
that many in the PP believe the Socialists and their allies 
manipulated the fear and emotion surrounding the March 11 
terrorist attacks for electoral gain.   Office of the 
President Parliamentary Affairs Director Ignacio Fernandez 
told us March 18 that the PP, as \"a serious and responsible 
party,\" would avoid undermining GOS institutions by casting 
doubt on the legitimacy of the vote.    Coordination on 
transition is going well, he said.    Vice President Javier 
Arenas is already holding meetings with Zapatero\'s number two 
(and likely Vice President), Jesus Caldera. 
 
GOS Denies Charges It Manipulated March 11 Investigation 
 
3. (C) PP contacts react strongly, however, to charges that 
the government withheld information related to the 
investigation for fear of electoral consequences. 
Fernandez and other emphasized to us that Interior Minister 
Acebes was not covering up by declaring, only hours after the 
March 11 attacks, that there was \"no doubt\" ETA was 
responsible.   Fernandez conceded that, in hindsight, it had 
probably been a mistake for Acebes to make an unequivocal 
declaration of ETA culpability so soon.   However, Fernandez 
and other PP contacts have stressed to us that his statements 
reflected the police analysis at the time.   On March 18, the 
GOS released police reports from March 11 in an effort to 
substantiate that point. 
 
Presumed ETA Role 
 
4. (C) Acebes\' Chief of Staff, Miguel Temboury, reiterated to 
us that the GOS had expected a massive ETA attack in Madrid 
on the eve of the elections.   He reminded us that in both 
December 2003 and February 2004, Spanish police foiled major 
ETA attacks including, on Christmas Eve, an attempted 
bombing, using explosives concealed in backpacks, of trains 
going to Madrid.   Furthermore, Fernandez pointed out, al 
Qaeda had never conducted a terrorist attack in Spain before. 
  Fernandez noted that naturally \"everyone,\" including 
opposition party leaders and the Basque nationalists, blamed 
ETA in the early hours.   The only exception was ETA\'s 
political wing, Batasuna.   The GOS suspected Batasuna of 
disinformation, hence Acebes\' statement early on that 
Batasuna\'s mention of \"Arab resistance\" as the culprit was 
\"miserable.\" 
 
Appearances Hurt 
 
5.  (C) Nonetheless, PP contacts affirm that appearances are 
what often matter most in politics, and the appearance of a 
cover up was extremely damaging.   This combined with 
widespread anti-Iraq war sentiment and raw fear turned the 
tides.    The cascade began when Acebes began to reverse 
himself late on March 11 after police found a van (near the 
train station where the bombed trains came from) with 
detonators and an audiotape of Koranic verses in it.   On 
Saturday March 13, election eve, Acebes announced the arrests 
of three Moroccans believed linked to terror cells and on 
March 14, within a few hours of the opening of the polls, 
came word of the release of a video tape, purportedly from al 
Qaeda, blaming the bombing on Aznar\'s involvement in Iraq and 
pledging more attacks if Spanish forces are not withdrawn. 
Meanwhile, also on election eve, anti-PP demonstrators by the 
thousands gathered at PP headquarters in Madrid denouncing a 
cover up.  The influential and pro-PSOE Prisa media group, 
which includes El Pais, fueled the flames.   The timing, 
Fernandez noted, could not have been worse and the PP, 
because of the suspension of campaigning before the election, 
could not answer back. 
 
Loyal Opposition 
 
6. (C) Fernandez said that the PP is reflecting on what else 
went wrong in the campaign.  He said that the campaign\'s 
media and information strategy was lacking.   He noted that 
there may be a PP Congress in the next few months, which 
could usher in leadership changes.    Fernandez said the PP 
would, as Rajoy has announced, seek to work with the 
Socialists on matters of state, notably counterterrorism and 
defending the Spanish constitutional order against Basque and 
Catalan nationalist efforts to further loosen central 
authority.    Rajoy has pledged the PP will be a \"loyal 
opposition.\" 
 
Concerns About PSOE Foreign Policy, Iraq, EU 
 
7. (C)  To the extent possible, Fernandez said, the PP would 
like to cooperate with PSOE on foreign policy.   However, he 
said the PP was deeply concerned about Zapatero\'s pledge to 
withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq by June 30 absent UN 
control over the mission.     He said the view in the PP was 
that this would be caving in to terrorists.   Fernandez 
speculated that if the US, France and Germany were able to 
agree on a UN resolution that would grant UN authority over 
the Iraq mission, Zapatero could be able to save face and 
agree to keep Spanish troops in Iraq.    Fernandez added that 
if Zapatero did not stand up for Spanish voting strength in 
the new EU constitution, the PP would make that a major issue 
in the June 2004 EU parliament elections. 
 
Aznar 
 
8. (C) In closing, Fernandez said that the vote was a 
personal blow for Aznar.   Having made counterterrorism the 
center of his presidency, Aznar\'s team, ironically, had been 
repudiated as a result of a terrorist attack.    Aznar 
\"didn\'t deserve this,\" Fernandez concluded.

FOREIGN MINISTER MORATINOS 
 
REF: STATE 2311 
 
Classified By: Ambassador George Argyros for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Argyros had a cordial discussion 
March 22 with Miguel Angel Moratinos, reported to be the 
leading candidate to serve as Foreign Minister under the 
government of Spanish Socialist Worker\'s Party (PSOE) leader 
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Moratinos stressed Zapatero,s 
appreciation for the President,s phone call after the March 
14 Spanish elections.  Moratinos was also grateful for 
Secretary Powell,s phone call to him on Friday, March 18. 
 
SIPDIS 
Moratinos said that Zapatero had asked him to convey to the 
Ambassador that his government will want to maintain the same 
level of excellent bilateral relations that had been 
constructed during the Popular Party (PP) government, and 
would express its differences constructively, as among 
friends. On Iraq, Moratinos reiterated Zapatero,s position 
that absent a UN mandate for troops there, Spanish troops 
would be withdrawn. However, he underscored that the U.S. and 
Spain must remain focused on their shared objective in Iraq: 
promoting stability and democracy.  He said we should work to 
find a way to meet these objectives \"with or without\" Spanish 
troops.  He also said that the PSOE government was 
considering increasing Spanish presence in Afghanistan, from 
where PSOE sees the most direct Al-Qaeda threat, 
demonstrating that PSOE would not appease terrorists. 
 
2.  (C) Moratinos said that Zapatero was grateful for the USG 
response to the terrorist attacks and the Spanish elections, 
but was concerned about criticism in the U.S. press and some 
other \"sectors\" that undermined the legitimacy of the Spanish 
elections by saying that Al-Qaeda had put PSOE in power. 
\"This is a redline for us, which we cannot accept,\" Moratinos 
said, and asked for USG help in dispelling this image. 
Ambassador Argyros drew from talking points in reftel to 
convey USG,s desire to work constructively with the new 
Spanish government on counter-terrorism and a range of other 
issues. END SUMMARY 
 
3.  (C) Moratinos opened the March 22 meeting with Ambassador 
Argyros by expressing his and President-elect Zapatero,s 
deep appreciation for the spirit and tone of the phone calls 
from President Bush to Zapatero and Secretary Powell to 
Moratinos.  He said Zapatero has specifically asked him to 
convey to Ambassador Argyros that the Spanish relationship 
with the U.S. would be his government\'s high priority.  PSOE 
wanted to build on the close ties that the Popular Party 
under President Aznar had built with the U.S.  It would be 
\"stupidity\" to end these ties, and PSOE wants to build on 
this strong relationship, Moratinos said.  Moratinos noted 
that Spain will want to strengthen its ties with Europe, \"our 
family,\" but that this does not contradict the need for close 
ties with the U.S.  PSOE wants rich U.S.-EU ties and strong 
U.S.-Spanish bilateral relations, he added.  \"We intend to 
work on the basis of no change\" in our bilateral relations 
from the PP government.  He said that the difference between 
the PSOE and PP approach would be that while PSOE would try 
to be \"constructively involved\" in Iraq and the Middle East, 
the new government would convey its concerns to the U.S., in 
the spirit of friendship and the desire to find common 
ground. 
 
4.  (C)  Moratinos expressed appreciation for his phone call 
with Secretary Powell, which he called \"excellent.\" 
Moratinos said that he had encountered the Secretary on 
various occasions in his capacity as EU envoy, and he would 
\"never forget\" the warmth of the Secretary\'s contacts with 
him. In the phone call, Moratinos said he had expressed his 
desire, as soon as he is formally invested as Foreign 
Minister, to visit Washington as his first trip. He 
reiterated this to the Ambassador.  Moratinos said the 
objective would be to underscore our strong ties and to have 
a serious discussion about what we can and cannot do on 
certain issues, and to find common ground.   He thought the 
government might be formally in place in the third week of 
April and would like to visit right after that. 
 
5.  (C)   Ambassador Argyros expressed deep condolences for 
the March 11 terrorist attacks.  Moratinos said that the 
President and Secretary Powell had reacted sincerely to the 
attacks and appropriately to the results of the Spanish 
elections three days later.  Moratinos said that Zapatero was 
concerned by the reaction by some press and \"some sectors\" in 
the U.S. (but not the USG itself) that Al-Qaeda handed PSOE 
their electoral victory.  This, Moratinos said, undermined 
the legitimacy of the Spanish election results.  Spain is a 
serious democracy, he said, with a sense of pride and 
commitment in defending and supporting what Spain has built 
through the years.  Moratinos said that PSOE \"will not 
accept\" criticism that Al-Qaeda put Zapatero in power.  He 
said this would be an insult to Zapatero, to Spanish 
democracy and the Spanish people.  Moratinos asked for USG 
help ) \"Whatever you can do\" to help dispel this image. 
This is a \"redline\" for PSOE, he stressed.  PSOE is not going 
to accept the image that the Spanish Republic is a banana 
republic.  Ambassador Argyros noted USG statements that the 
elections 3 days after the horrific terrorist attacks was a 
victory for Spanish democracy. 
 
6.  (C) Moratinos and Argyros agreed on the importance of 
avoiding setting US-Spanish relations through rhetoric and 
the need for private dialogue and meetings.  Ambassador 
Argyros also suggested the importance of avoiding commentary 
or speculation on the US elections by senior PSOE leadership. 
Moratinos said that PSOE, including Zapatero, understood 
this.  He said that there would be no more commentary from 
Zapatero or the PSOE on the US elections. 
 
7.  (C) On Iraq, Moratinos said that \"if there is not a 
change in the role of the UN\" in Iraq, we will pull out our 
troops.  But, he asked the Ambassador to convey to the 
President and the Secretary that Spanish commitment to a 
stable, democratic Iraq remained unwavering, and that this 
would continue \"with or without Spanish troops.\"  Moratinos 
said PSOE knows the U.S. would prefer that the troops remain, 
but, he added, it is important to underscore that we share 
the same objective of a democratic, stable Iraq.  \"Let\'s talk 
together,\" he said, about how we can achieve this objective. 
The U.S., he said, has a great role to play in this, and 
should.  \"We are not going to put our finger in your eye\" on 
Iraq, according to Moratinos.  Again, he reiterated his 
desire to discuss how we can achieve our objectives in Iraq 
\"with or without\" Spanish troops. 
 
8. (C)  Ambassador Argyros underscored our commitment to 
maintain strong US-Spanish ties in NATO.  Moratinos said that 
\"nothing will change at all\" on NATO issues, noting that the 
USG and the previous PSOE government had had excellent 
relations.  Moratinos said that the new government was 
thinking of increasing Spanish involvement in Afghanistan, to 
help counter Al-Qaeda there.  He said PSOE wanted to make 
clear that it would not appease Al-Qaeda, and wanted to 
respond in way that Spain could be most effective.  He noted 
that the new government would have a commitment to the 
Spanish people to react to the March 11 attacks.  He 
indicated that increasing Spain\'s role in Afghanistan would 
also show that the PSOE government was not appeasing 
terrorists. 
 
9. (C)  On counter-terrorism, Moratinos said that Spain, 
Europe and the US needed to work together to revisit their 
counter-terrorism strategy (he would not call it a \"war\" 
because that would give legitimacy to the terrorists, he 
said), since the current strategy has not stemmed the tide of 
terrorism.  Spain might call for a dialogue between the US 
and the EU on terrorism, to have a fresh discussion of 
strategy, identify what has worked and what has failed. 
 
10. (C) Ambassador Argyros also underscored areas in which 
the U.S. and Spain share common interests, such as Latin 
America, where both Spain and the U.S. have huge investments 
and an interest in stability and democracy.  Moratinos agreed. 
 
11. (C) On the Middle East Moratinos mentioned the need to 
maintain the commitment to the Roadmap.  He expressed deep 
concern, however, about the effect of the assassination just 
minutes before this meeting, by Israeli forces of the Hamas 
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.  Moratinos had to break briefly 
from the meeting to give a statement to the Spanish press on 
the issue. He said that he considered this leader 
reprehensible, but was deeply concerned about the impact in 
the region of this \"extra-judicial\" killing (see paragraph 14 
for text of Moratinos\' March 22 statement on Hamas killing). 
 
12.  (C) At the close of the discussion, both the Ambassador 
and Moratinos agreed on the importance of building on the 
U.S.-Spanish ties relationship and our shared commitment to 
the war on terrorism.  Ambassador Argyros throughout the 
meeting underscored the USG,s desire to work closely with 
the new government on issues of common concern, noting that,

13.  (U) Moratinos\' statement on Hamas killing, in interview 
on Spanish national radio:  \"It puts the situation in the 
Middle East and relations between Israel and Palestine back 
into a situation of a vicious circle of violence from which 
we are unable to emerge.  Therefore I believe we all 
understand and we all share the state of Israel\'s security 
needs, but that cannot justify going outside the rule of law 
to fight terrorism when there are commitments to respect the 
rule of law, and that is what we have always said:  these 
kinds of extrajudicial operations must be avoided and ended, 
because they only create greater cries for vengeance, greater 
unease and frustration among the Palestinian population.\"

SUBJECT: TERRORISM FINANCE:  MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER FOR 
SPAIN 
 
REF: A) STATE 37211 B) MADRID 960 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Judy Garber, reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Spain has been a strong ally in the fight 
against terrorism finance.  That said, the GOS has not always 
been as pro-active as we believe they could and should be in 
this fight.  While Spain passed bold new laws after September 
11 providing the government with administrative authorities 
to freeze suspected terrorist assets, we sense a reluctance 
on the part of our contacts to utilize these new powers and 
the regulations to implement those laws have stalled.  The 
horrific attacks of March 11 may well provide new impetus. 
Whereas before, Spain looked to test these new authorities 
against ETA rather than joining us in actions against 
non-Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee targets, officials may now 
feel less comfortable with such a narrow approach. We are 
consulting closely with our working level contacts involved 
in these issues as they prepare transition papers for the new 
government.  We believe terrorism finance is an area ripe for 
continued strong bilateral cooperation.  End Summary. 
 
Strong Support With Lackluster Results 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Spain has been as strong ally of the United States in 
the fight against terrorism finance.  They worked closely 
with the United States during their EU Presidency on UNSCR 
1373.  Spain agreed to chair with the United States the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Working Group on Terrorism 
Finance.  They have worked closely with the United States as 
UN Counterterrorism Committee (CTC) Chair.  At our urging, 
they adopted new terrorism finance legislation providing the 
government with unprecedented administrative authority to 
freeze suspected terrorist financial assets.  Spain has been 
an important part of a core group of EU countries seeking to 
reform the EU clearinghouse process to make it more 
effective.  They strongly supported our efforts to have the 
EU designate Hamas as a terrorist organization and have been 
working with other EU member states to extend the designation 
of the PKK to KADEK/Kongra Gel.  Last but not least, Spain 
has been a prominent provider of counter-terrorism assistance 
in Latin America, North Africa and elsewhere. 
 
3.  (C) Yet for all of that support, the results in Spain 
have been marginal in measurable terms.  While Spanish 
authorities have moved rapidly to freeze accounts of those 
individuals added to UN 1267 Sanctions Committee or EU lists, 
little actual monies have been seized.  Of those accounts 
that have been frozen, the majority have been later unblocked 
due to lack of clear identifiers leading to initial error in 
the freezing action or upon petition of hardship.  Action 
taken by Spanish authorities through judicial rather than 
administrative channels are very difficult to track as there 
is no central registry of such freezing orders. 
 
Areas for Improvement 
--------------------- 
 
4.  (C) While we do not believe that Spain has failed to 
freeze any accounts of individuals on these lists, we believe 
they have not used administrative authorities now at their 
disposable to go after suspected terrorist assets.  In 
fairness, implementing regulations for the law passed in May 
2003 have yet to be approved and relevant authorities 
(members of the Terrorism Finance Oversight Committee) are 
concerned about using their new powers without full legal 
cover.  Likewise, there is considerable reluctance by the 
Ministry of Interior to notify for coordinated UN freezing 
(or EU action) any suspected Islamic terrorist financiers 
already in custody, much less those under suspicion. 
Officials voice concern that without an actual prior 
conviction of such individuals by a court of law, a judicial 
appeal process could theoretically overturn administrative 
actions to freeze assets. Our arguments that such 
administrative actions are meant to be preventative and 
pro-active in nature have fallen on deaf ears. 
 
5. (C) We also suspect that oversight of Islamic charities in 
Spain has not been as strong as it could be.  We base this 
conclusion on primarily anecdotal evidence.  For example, one 
Spanish businessman told us that in the process of due 
diligence for a multimillion dollar investment in Cartegena, 
he inquired whether there were security concerns arising from 
the area\'s large immigrant population.  The police reportedly 
responded that they knew that many of the North African 
immigrants in the area gave heavily to Islamic charities and 
suspected that some of these funds were being siphoned off to 
extremist causes but had no real proof.  This tracks with 
comments of our Ministry of Economy contacts who questioned 
with us the conviction of senior level officials at the 
Ministry of Interior (prior to March 11) that Islamic 
terrorism in Spain was an area of legitimate concern.  The 
focus was clearly on ETA. 
 
New Government, New Opportunities 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Spanish President-elect Zapatero has stated clearly 
that the fight against terrorism will be a priority for his 
government.  The terrorist attacks of March 11 virtually 
leave him no choice.  Our working level contacts on terrorism 
finance are starting to prepare the briefing papers for the 
incoming Zapatero government.  We are consulting closely with 
them, sharing thoughts on areas of emphasis -- ie, the 
importance of Spain notifying UNSC of suspected Al-Qaeda 
members for asset freezing purposes, reform of the EU 
clearinghouse, eliminating distinctions in EU law between 
domestic and international terrorism, etc. We will also try 
to glean inklings of the likely views of incoming officials 
(as they are named) who will be vital to keeping Spain front 
and center on these issues. 
 
7.  (C) Our contacts believe Spain will continue to be active 
on terrorism finance issues given the long-standing fight 
against ETA terrorism and the need to apply lessons learned 
from the investigation of the March 11 terrorist attacks. 
Many think the new government will want to announce new 
initiatives (real or recycled) in the fight against terrorism 
quickly, including in the area of terrorism finance.  We 
understand Treasury has already reached out to its contacts 
offering to support a conference on these issues should Spain 
still be interested in hosting an event similar to January\'s 
ill-fated terrorism finance conference.  It is too soon to 
know if such a conference would be favored by the new 
government, but such offers will be important gestures to the 
new government.  Spain has a lot to offer on terrorism 
finance -- and a lot more to do itself as evidence of its 
role as an al-Qaeda logistical base becomes ever clearer.  We 
strongly believe terrorism finance should remain a key area 
for continued bilateral cooperation.

REF: STATE 64477 
 
1.  (U) Embassy Madrid Emergency Action Committee (EAC) met 
on 25 March 2004 as per REFTEL.  The EAC discussed the 
concerns and possible threat considerations as outlined.  The 
RSO stated that a Verbal Note was prepared for the Spanish 
Police requesting an augmentation of both static and dynamic 
police presence for the Embassy in Madrid, the Consulate 
General in Barcelona, and the six Consular Agencies. 
 
2.  (SBU) Questions were addressed regarding the use of the 
surveillance detection elements, the special considerations 
of the Business International Center (BIC), and the general 
preparedness of all USG-Spain facilities.  It was presented 
that a small varying of assets, controls, numbers of police 
and other elements, keeps the potential enemy off-balance and 
unable to make a coherent plan of operation.  The RSO stated 
that this was exactly the course being followed but never 
allowing the security preparations to dip below a 100 percent 
level of coverage and control.  Only varying the coverage by 
levels of increase and change.  It was determined that the

REF: MADRID 919 
 
1. (U) Summary:  Future Spanish President Jose Luis Rodriguez 
Zapatero is revealing his cabinet selections on a piecemeal 
basis as the government formation process procedes.  Thus far 
he has officially named Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega as 
First Vice President of Government and Minister of the 
Presidency, Pedro Solbes as Second Vice President and 
Minister of Economy and Finance, Jose Bono as Minister of 
Defense, Manuel Marin as PSOE\'s candidate for President of 
Congress (making him a virtual shoe-in), and Alfredo Perez 
Rubalcaba as PSOE,s Spokesperson in Congress.  Though widely 
expected to be Foreign Minister, Miguel Moratinos has not yet 
recieved the official nod.   Biographical information for 
these new appointees is provided as a follow up to reftel. 
End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) The list below provides biographical information on 
those whom Zapatero has officially named to his 
administration thus far. 
 
(A) Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega:  First Vice President 
of Government and Minister of the Presidency.  Fernandez de 
la Vega is Zapatero\'s first female appointee.  Born in 
Valencia in 1949, Fernandez de la Vega holds a master\'s and 
doctoral degree in law, and was a university professor before 
becoming active in politics.  Fernandez de la Vega joined the 
now-defunct Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) in 
1974.  In 1982, she was appointed to lead the Cabinet of 
Ministers of Justice by the Spanish Socialist Worker\'s Party 
(PSOE).  From 1985 to 1989, she was designated as PSOE\'s 
Director General of Services for the Ministry of Justice. 
Fernandez de la Vega also served as Spokesperson for the 
governing council of the Institute of Women (1986), 
Spokesperson for the General Council of Judicial Powers 
(1990), and Secretary of State for Justice (1994).  When the 
Popular Party won the general elections in 1996, Fernandez de 
la Vega joined the opposition as a member of the Socialist 
parliamentary group in Congress. 
 
(B) Pedro Solbes:  Second Vice President of Government and 
Minister of the Economy.   Solbes, born in 1942 in Alicante, 
is returning to Spanish government after serving as European 
Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs since 1999. 
Solbes earned high marks for taking the EU Council of 
Ministers to task for their refusal to sanction France and 
German for exceeding the Europe Stability and Growth Pact\'s 
budget deficit limits.  Although he is not technically a 
member of socialist party, Solbes has served in the Spanish 
government since 1968, when he began his career a civil 
servant in the Ministry of Foreign Trade.  As Director 
General of Commercial Policy in the Ministry of Economics and 
Trade (1979-1982), Solbes played an important role in 
negotiating Spanish accession to the European Community.  He 
was Secretary General of Economy and Treasury (1982-1985), 
Secretary of State for EU relations (1985), Minister of 
 
SIPDIS 
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (1991-1993), and Minister of 
Economy and Treasury (1993-1996).  In 1996, Solbes became a 
member of the Spanish Parliament.  He left this position to 
become EU Commissioner in 1999. 
 
(C) Jose Bono:  Cited by Zapatero prior to the elections as 
his for Minister of Interior, Bono has now been officially 
tapped as Minister of Defense.  Bono is a key socialist 
\"baron\" who has spent the last twenty-one years as President 
of the regional government of Castilla-La Mancha.  He has 
stated that he will resign as President, without choosing a 
successor, once he is officially named defense minister by 
public decree in April.  Bono, a one-time challenger to 
Zapatero for the position of PSOE Secretary General in 2000, 
has recently downplayed his alleged rivalry with Zapatero. 
Zapatero, Bono stated, won PSOE\'s top spot as \"the better 
man\" and was \"noble\" for choosing him as defense minister. 
Bono opposes nationalist plans to break up Spain and fully 
backs Zapatero\'s promise to withdraw troops from Iraq absent 
UN control. 
 
(D) Manuel Marin has been named president of Congress.  See 
reftel for biographical information. 
 
(E) Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba:  PSOE Spokesperson in Congress. 
Rubalcaba, born in Solares, Santander in 1951, began his 
political career in the Madrid Socialist Forum in 1978.  A 
professor of chemistry, Rubalcaba served as an advisor on 
university affairs to the Socialist Parliamentary Group. 
After the Socialists won the national elections in 1982, 
Rubalcaba was appointed Director of Technical Cabinet of 
Secretary of State for Universities, Director General for 
 
SIPDIS 
Higher Education (1985), and Secretary of State for Education 
(1988), and served as Minister of Education from 1992 to 
1993.  In 1993, Rubalcaba began his career in Congress.  He 
served as Minister of the Presidency of Relations with 
Parliament and Spokesperson for the Government until the PP 
won a majority in Congress in 1996.  After 1996, Rubalcaba 
served as PSOE\'s Secretary for Media Relations and was the 
party\'s chief negotiator in government talks on the 
Anti-Terrorist Pact and the Political Party Law.  Rubalcaba 
developed a close friendship with Zapatero when he supported 
his candidacy for PSOE Secretary General in 2000.

SUBJECT: NEW SOCIALIST MAJORITY APPEARS STABLE 
 
REF: MADRID 900 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  The margin of the Socialist (PSOE) victory 
on March 14 should allow them to take power without any 
formal coalition agreements with smaller parties.  While the 
PSOE\'s 164 seats fall 12 short of an absolute majority, it 
should allow them to govern stably, especially given the fact 
that the Popular Party (PP) has no realistic alternative 
coalition to challenge the PSOE.  The Socialists have stated 
that they will form coalitions as needed on an issue-by-issue 
basis, freeing them from being dependent on leftist or 
nationalist coalition partners.  While the Spanish system has 
no set date for the investiture of the new government, 
expectations are that the process will move quickly and that 
the Zapatero administration will be installed by mid to late 
April.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Stable PSOE Majority 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Though not the 176 votes necessary for an absolute 
majority in Congress, the PSOE majority is large enough to 
govern comfortably by historic standards.  Both major parties 
won with less than absolute majorities in the 1990\'s (the 
PSOE in 1993 with 159 seats and the PP in 1996 with 156 
seats), and were able to maintain stable governments.  The 
164 seats that the PSOE received on March 14 are sufficient 
to counter the most likely alternative combination of votes 
(the PP\'s 148 seats with the CiU\'s (moderate Catalan 
nationalists) 10 seats and the Canaries Coalition\'s 3, for a 
total of 161 votes), even without the support of the other 
parties.  Given that legislation can be passed by a simple 
majority, the PSOE position in Congress thus appears secure. 
The PSOE can count on the 13 votes of the other leftist 
parties (ERC (leftist Catalan nationalists) with eight, IU 
(Communists) with five) on most issues to increase the 
Socialist\'s margin.  The inability of the PP in opposition to 
attract potential coalition partners permits the PSOE to 
enter into governance with no formal coalition agreements, 
allowing the Socialists to avoid having to make deals on 
ministerial positions or controversial issues that could 
potentially alienate moderate voters. 
 
3. (SBU) On issues such as the devolution of powers to the 
regions, where the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties may 
differ from the Socialists, the PP has already pledged its 
support to maintain the territorial integrity of Spain, and 
would agree with Socialist positions that support this 
principle. 
 
4. (SBU) In the other legislative chamber, the PP lost 24 
seats in the Senate on March 14 (from 127 to 103).  However, 
they remain only two seats short of an absolute majority of 
105 seats.  With the support of the 3 seats of the Canaries 
Coalition (CC), the PP should be able to control the Senate. 
However, given the weak powers of the Senate, the most the PP 
can hope for is to delay and amend legislation, not kill it, 
as the Senate can be overridden by the Congress of Deputies. 
 
----------------------------- 
Investiture Schedule 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The first step in the formation of the Zapatero 
government occurs on April 2 with the choosing of the 
President of the Congress (see reftel).  That position will 
almost certainly go to the PSOE\'s former foreign policy 
spokesman in Congress, Manuel Marin, who is PSOE leader Jose 
Luis Rodriguez Zapatero\'s choice for the job.  While the 
process for the election of Zapatero as President of the 
Government could take until the beginning of May, it is 
widely expected that the process will go rapidly.  MFA 
contacts have predicted that the Zapatero government should 
be in power by April 14-19.  Some smaller parties have 
already indicated their support for Zapatero\'s investiture, 
without any coalition agreement, which would allow the PSOE 
leader to be elected President of the Government on the first 
round of voting in the Congress of Deputies with the support 
of an absolute majority.  Even if he does not receive an 
absolute majority on the first round, Zapatero can become 
President of the Government on a second round of votes in 
Congress by a simple majority.

MINISTER-DESIGNATE JOSE BONO 
 
REF: MADRID 1052 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick, 
reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Ambassador met March 30 with Socialist 
defense minister-designate Jose Bono.  The meeting was very 
pleasant and friendly, and Bono pledged to do his part to 
continue the fine relations the U.S. and Spain have developed 
over the years.  He characterized himself as a \"moderate 
socialist\" and said he was a friend of the United States. 
Bono will be in the U.S. April 2-6 and requested a meeting 
with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to discuss Iraq.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
Friend of the United States 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Ambassador met with Bono in Toledo, the capital of 
the Castilla-La Mancha region, where Bono has been the very 
popular president for over 20 years.  (See reftel for bio on 
Bono).  Defense Attache and Pol-miloff joined Ambassador -- 
Bono was not joined by any staff in the meeting.  Bono 
started off by saying he was a \"moderate socialist\" who 
considers Spain to be a close friend and ally of the U.S.  He 
was anxious to reinforce the great relationship the two 
countries have, and predicted he along with the rest of the 
Zapatero administration would be in office by April 19.  Bono 
commented that he was a friend of the U.S. and added, 
chuckling, that he is one of the few Spanish politicians who 
can say he has never taken a position counter to the U.S.  He 
recalled that he has twice traveled to the U.S. at USG 
invitation on visitor programs and had excellent experiences 
both times.  Ambassador assured Bono the U.S. was also 
looking forward to continuing the fine relations the U.S. and 
Spain have developed. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Relationship Based on Trust and Friendship 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C) Bono said as far as he is concerned, Spain\'s 
relations with the U.S. are based on two firm pillars -- 
confidence and friendship.  That\'s how he views the 
relationship and he plans to continue the relationship that 
way.  He noted that in the early 80s when Spain and the U.S. 
were reviewing the status of the bases in Spain, many on the 
U.S. side were worried the Socialists would be very hard to 
work with.  On the contrary, both sides worked together very 
well and reached an excellent agreement for both parties.  He 
said he was sure the U.S. and Spain would continue to work 
well together on all issues. 
 
4.  (C) On the other hand, Bono said it was not good for 
Spain to feel as though it is in a position of submission to 
anyone, as that hurts national pride.  \"A very proud country 
like the U.S. could certainly understand that,\" he added. 
But he was confident the U.S. and Spain would continue the 
excellent relationship they have had for years, and Bono 
looked forward to working with us to that end. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Requests Meeting with Sec. Rumsfeld on Iraq 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) On Iraq, Bono said he would very much like to speak 
directly to Secretary Rumsfeld.  Bono will be in New York 
City April 2-6 and wondered if it might be possible to 
arrange a meeting in that time frame -- Bono would be willing 
to travel to D.C. to meet with Secretary Rumsfeld.  If a 
personal meeting is not possible, Bono is very interested in 
talking Rumsfeld by phone as soon as possible.  He would like 
to do so before he meets with the Polish defense minister 
April 8 and the British defense minister April 12. 
Pol-miloff asked Bono if he might give us a preview of what 
he planned to tell Rumsfeld about Iraq.  Bono replied that 
unfortunately he was limited in what he could say at this 
point and Zapatero had specifically asked him only to speak 
to Rumsfeld about the issue, so he wasn\'t able to elaborate 
at this time, though he wished he could.

Comment

6.  (C) Jose Bono is one of the stars of Jose Luis Rodriguez 
Zapatero\'s emerging cabinet.  Long a very popular luminary of 
the Socialist Party, Bono is very polished and, as he said, 
has rarely criticized the United States openly.  Bono will 
likely do what he can to keep Spain/U.S. military relations 
on track, but it remains to be seen how much latitude 
Zapatero will give him.  Given that Bono is a Socialist Party 
heavyweight, Zapatero may give him more leeway than he gives 
other members of his administration.  We recommend that if 
Bono comes to Washington to meet with Secretary Rumsfeld, the 
Department also seek to arrange a meeting between Bono and 
Deputy Secretary Armitage.

1. (C) PolCouns and Poloff met with Augustin Nunez, MFA 
Director General for UN Affairs (A/S equivalent) on March 26 
to follow up on our initial March 23 approach to senior MFA 
officials regarding the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) Cuba 
and China resolutions (reftels A and B).  We stressed our 
desire for Spain, though not a CHR member, to help garner 
support for the upcoming resolutions among the EU and to 
co-sponsor the resolutions. Nunez took the opportunity to 
recall that Spain had been a CHR candidate previously, but 
withdrew so the US could regain its seat, and that Spain 
would like to get back on the Commission. (Note: this has 
been a recurring theme with the Spanish, as post has reported 
previously (reftel C).  In a subsequent lunch meeting on 
March 29, Inigo de Palacio, Director of the UN Affairs Office 
under Nunez in the MFA, stressed to Poloff Spain\'s desire for 
USG assistance in lobbying for Spain\'s candidacy for the CHR. 
 De Palacio asked if Washington could inform the MFA or 
Spain\'s UN representation if the USG intended to provide this 
assistance to the Spanish candidacy. End Note) 
 
2. (C) Nunez stressed first that under the current caretaker 
government, no important decisions could be made without 
consultation with the incoming Socialist government, and that 
as yet there were no interlocutors selected by the incoming 
government to consult with on these issues.  That said, he 
noted that the EU members of the CHR likely would vote for 
the Cuba resolution; the question for Spain was whether to 
co-sponsor.  Nunez said that if the majority of EU countries 
decided to co-sponsor, Spain would likely go along.  He also 
added that EU policy opposes no-action motions, and that the 
policy would remain in place for both the Cuba and China 
resolutions. 
 
3. (C) On China, Nunez said that unlike the USG, the EU sees 
the EU-China Human rights dialogue as the more effective 
means to deal with China on human rights concerns, and 
believes the on-going dialogue mitigates the need for a 
resolution.  Spain would not take an active role on this 
issue, he said.  Nunez stated that if the resolution is put 
to a vote, EU members would likely abstain or vote in favor. 
 
4. (C) On China accepting a visit by the Special Rapporteur 
on Torture, Nunez said that the Dutch had indicated that the 
Chinese had finally accepted a visit, though with no date 
certain.  He took the opportunity to express concern about 
Special Rapporteur Van Boven\'s report on Spain, which is very 
unfavorable toward Spain regarding treatment of ETA prisoners 
(reftel C).  Nunez said Van Boven was operating off of 
outmoded concepts, viewing modern Spain as if it were Spain 
under Franco or Central America 20 years ago.

REF: A. MADRID 919 
 
     B. MADRID 1052 
     C. MADRID 1074 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Goerge L. Argyros, reasons 
1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  When you meet with Jose Bono April 5 in 
Washington, you will find this long-time Socialist party 
\"heavyweight\" an affable, smooth politician who could be a 
pro-U.S. voice of reason in the new government headed up by 
Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. 
We suggest focusing on the positive aspects of the 
Spanish-U.S. defense relationship and caution against trying 
to force Bono, in this first meeting, to define the new 
government\'s policies in all areas of cooperation, in 
particular the U.S.\'s use of Spanish bases at Rota and Moron. 
 We think that allowing Bono and other members of the new 
government some time to adjust to their new roles will 
increase the possibility the U.S. can persuade them to take 
positions favorable for American interests.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) Bono is one of the PSOE\'s key party bosses and 
narrowly lost to Zapatero in a struggle for party leadership 
in 2000.  (Refs A and B contain more detailed bio 
information).  He is well respected by those in his party as 
well as by members of the soon-to-be opposition Popular Party 
(PP).  He is also highly regarded by the Spanish military. 
Bono is likely to be a strong and highly influential figure 
in the Zapatero administration. 
 
3.  (C) In my meeting with him March 30, Bono said he was a 
friend of the U.S. and looked forward to continuing Spain\'s 
excellent defense relationship with the U.S. (ref C).  He 
asked to meet with Secretary Rumsfeld to convey personally on 
Zapatero\'s behalf the new government\'s position on Spanish 
troops serving in Iraq.  He politely declined to preview the 
position for me in the meeting.  We are unsure as to what 
Bono plans to say on the issue.  Nonetheless, it seems odd 
that Bono would not be willing to discuss the Spanish 
position with me if he simply planned to repeat to Secretary 
Rumsfeld Zapatero\'s publicly declared position on Iraq. 
There is at least some chance Bono plans to pass on 
information Zapatero has not mentioned in public. 
 
4.  (C) Although Zapatero made a big campaign issue out of 
his opposition to the Iraq war and to Spanish troops in Iraq 
reconstruction, neither he nor any other PSOE leaders made an 
issue out of U.S. use of Spanish bases at Rota and Moron.  We 
thus think it is important to steer clear of pressing Bono 
and the Spanish too hard to define their position at this 
early stage on the U.S.\'s use of the bases.  The U.S. is more 
likely to be able to favorably influence Zapatero government 
thinking on the bases if we allow Zapatero, Bono and others 
to assume their new positions and become familiar with this 
complex issue (including learning from their own military how 
positive our cooperation has been up to now).  Forcing their 
hand now may make them take a hard line position they might 
not otherwise take. 
 
5.  (C) On the Spanish troop deployment to Iraq, we believe 
that Zapatero and his PSOE advisors have not yet made up 
their minds about whether a new UN resolution could cover 
their campaign promise to withdraw Spanish troops if there is 
no UN mandate.  We also believe that Zapatero and his 
advisors have not yet fleshed out the kind of content they 
would need in such a resolution to provide them with 
political cover to allow the troops to remain.  Therefore, 
this is a moment in which outreach at the senior leadership 
level can have some influence, as long as we are not seen as 
pushing them on other politically sensitive issues on which 
the as-yet-to-be-formed government has not determined its key 
interests.

1.  (C) We presented reftel points to Marcos Rodriguez 
Cantero in the office of International Disarmament Affairs at 
the MFA on March 30.  Rodriguez, who will be Spain\'s delegate 
to the PrepCom, said Spain would support U.S. proposals to 
strengthen the IAEA Board of Governors and the Proliferation 
Security Initiative to ensure that nations comply with 
international safeguard obligations on non-proliferation.  He 
also agreed that linking procedural issues to agreement on 
substantive issues at the PrepCom is a non-starter.  Gaining 
consensus on non-proliferation issues should be the top 
priority, he said. 
 
2.  (SBU) Rodriguez pointed out that Spain ratified the IAEA 
Additional Protocol in 1999.  As current chair of the Board 
of Governors, Spain expects the Protocol to come into force 
before May 1, so that the countries that join the EU on May 2 
will be bound by it. 
 
3.  (C) Rodriguez expressed concern about restricting exports 
of sensitive nuclear fuel-cycle technology.  He cautioned 
that such restriction could create a more lucrative market 
for nuclear fuel-cycle technology, which could either 
influence more countries to develop nuclear technology or 
give countries of concern, like the Iran and the DPRK, a 
stronger economic impetus to continue to develop and share 
sensitive technology.  Rodriguez believes export restrictions 
could also create an international export \'cartel\' that would 
exclude smaller producers of nuclear fuel-cycle technology in 
countries like Brazil and Mexico.  Rodriguez does not foresee 
export restrictions becoming an issue at the PrepCom. 
However, he expects the issue will be raised at next meeting 
of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and may pick up momentum 
leading up to the 2005 NPT Review Conference.

SUBJECT: SPAIN\'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TRAINING, NEEDS AND 
BEST PRACTICES 
 
REF: Secstate 42798 
 
1. There is a significant amount of intellectual property 
(IP) training and education in Spain sponsored by government 
ministries, police entities, and industry groups.  To add to 
GOS efforts, we have arranged working breakfasts, 
roundtables, and lunches with the active participation of 
government representatives, police contacts, and 
intellectual property professionals to discuss policies and 
strategies to combat piracy. 
 
2. Answers are queued to reftel questions: 
 
A.1  N/A 
 
A.2 The Spanish Ministries of Culture (where the Copyright 
Office is located) and Science and Technology (where the 
Patent and Trademark Office is located,) through an Inter- 
Ministerial Intellectual Property Rights Committee have 
conducted or sponsored a number of IP-related seminars and 
courses to inform and train judges, prosecutors, police, and 
experts, and at times, government officials from Latin 
America or the EU enlargement countries.  The Inter- 
Ministerial Committee annual report for 2002 (the latest 
available) lists a variety of IP training programs conducted 
with GOS involvement.  Examples include: 
 
- The Spanish Patent and Trademark Office (OEPM is the 
acronym in Spanish) arranged a seminar about patent and 
trademark law for judges and prosecutors from Latin America. 
 
- The Studies Center for the Development of Investigation, 
in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and 
Technology, organized a series of 10 conferences to analyze 
the impact of new technologies on IP. 
 
- OEPM carried out several different seminars in 
collaboration with WIPO and the European Patent Office to 
train Latin American officials on legal, administrative and 
economic aspects of patent and trademark protection. 
 
- The Ministry of Justice organized a seminar on legal 
aspects of IP protection in the EU during Spain\'s 2002 EU 
Presidency. 
 
- Since 1996, the Ministry of Culture has been working with 
the Spanish Judiciary Counsel on courses for judges and 
prosecutors.  Thus far 149 professionals have participated. 
 
- Spanish Customs Officials made presentations at seminars 
organized by the EU to help train candidate country 
officials on IP issues. 
 
- In 2002 the National Police included intellectual property 
issues in training courses in which over one thousand 
officers have participated. 
 
IP industry groups in Spain are also extremely active.  They 
have developed numerous roundtables, seminars and courses 
for the police, judges, and/or prosecutors about 
intellectual property and piracy, copyright laws, and IP in 
the EU.  Events take place in all over Spain. 
 
B.1  On a more or less annual basis, the Spanish Association 
of Authors and Publishers (Sociedad General de Autores y 
Editores, SGAE) conducts a two-day international seminar 
about intellectual property rights protection.  We attended 
the November 2002 seminar and found it extremely effective. 
Spanish and international speakers successfully highlighted 
the need for fighting piracy.  A roundtable about the 
activities of the various Spanish police forces against IP 
crimes was particularly informative.  Members of Parliament 
and the then-Minister of Justice also participated.  The 
effect of the conference was multiplied as the domestic 
press carried over a dozen articles on IP issues as a result 
of the conference. 
 
B.2 We believe the type of seminar described in B.1 is 
especially useful as the high-level participants ensure 
diffuse media coverage and a high turnout.  More technical 
segments are also targeted at the audience of interested IP 
industry representatives and government officials. 
 
B.3 In November 2003, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for 
Market Access and Compliance, William H. Lash, III, raised 
IP issues with senior-level officers at the Ministry of 
Culture, at the Presidency of the Government, and the 
Ministry of Economy.  He also led an IPR roundtable with 
industry associations. 
 
In July 2003, Embassy Madrid invited AOL-Time Warner\'s Vice 
President and Associate General Counsel for Intellectual 
Property Policy, Shira Perlmutter, and the Vice President 
for Legal and Public Policy, Alessandra Silvestri, to 
discuss strategies to combat IP piracy with a wide range of 
Spanish contacts.  One event brought in over 40 senior-level 
government officials, lawyers, and private association 
representatives.  The two speakers also met separately with 
eight senior government and law enforcement officials. 
 
In 2000, Embassy Madrid hosted a breakfast roundtable, a 
working lunch and a meeting on IPR issues in which over 40 
Spaniards participated.  Participants were senior-level 
representatives from industry associations and the national 
government.  Deputy Assistant USTR for Intellectual 
Property, Claude Burcky, and attorney-advisor at the United 
States Copyright Office, Rachel Goslins, led all the 
meetings.  The U.S. Consulate General in Barcelona hosted 
similar events. 
 
C.1 Post believes the IV program can be extremely useful to 
introduce host country officials to the most innovative U.S. 
strategies to fight IP infringement.  In FY 2002 two Spanish 
contacts (a university law professor and a mid-level 
copyright office functionary) participated in IP-specific IV 
programs in the U.S.  In FY 2004, another mid-level 
copyright office official and two judges will participate in 
a similar program. 
 
We have proposed, for FY 2005, a special IV program to train 
national police, local police and civil guard officers in 
the newest strategies to fight IP infringement.

1. Summary: The Ambassador traveled March 30-31 to Santiago 
de Compostela, capital of the northwestern region of Galicia, 
to open the eighth in a series of regional seminars on 
E-Commerce and Internet for small and medium sized firms. 
The Ambassador took the opportunity to meet with President of 
the Galician region and eminent Spanish politician Manuel 
Fraga and President of Galicia\'s regional parliament Jose 
Maria Leira as well as a group of prominent Galician business 
leaders to discuss economic and political issues.  Neither 
the politicians, both of whom are Popular Party (PP) members, 
nor the business leaders were pleased with the Socialist 
Party victory in the March 14 national elections.  However, 
they said they would work cooperatively with the new 
Administration just as they had the last time the Socialists 
were in office (1982-96).  At the March 31 business seminar, 
the Ambassador highlighted the significant potential for US 
and Spanish firms in the areas of Internet and E-Commerce. 
In his meetings as well as in interviews with local press, 
the Ambassador expressed condolences for the March 11 
terrorist attacks in Madrid and pledged continued cooperation 
in fighting terrorism.  End summary. 
 
2. The Ambassador traveled to the capital of Galicia, 
Santiago de Compostela, to open the eighth in a series of 
regional seminars focused on opportunities for small and 
medium sized companies in E-Commerce and Internet-based 
trade.  This seminar, like the previous seven, was organized 
by the Spanish Employers Association (CEOE) with the 
assistance of the US Commercial Service.  In his 
presentation, the Ambassador highlighted the objectives of 
the seminar: to help Spanish firms to build technological 
bridges with the US, find the latest in US technology and 
promote strategic alliances with US companies.  He pointed 
out the great potential for expanded ties between US and 
Spanish firms in the areas of Internet and E-Commerce.  While 
over 80% of US firms have their own website on the Internet 
and more than 60% of US businesses buy and sell on-line, only 
40% of Spanish companies have their own site and only 11% are 
active on E-Commerce transaction, with most of the purchases 
by Spanish firms and individuals coming from the US (37%). 
The Commercial Service has planned trade missions and other 
trade events designed to bring together small and medium 
sized companies from both countries to get to know each other 
and do business together. 
 
3. The night before the seminar, the Ambassador had dinner 
with a small group of Galician business leaders to ask them 
about the growth prospects for their respective sectors and 
to get their take on the outcome of the March 14 national 
elections.  While all of the participants expressed 
disappointment with the Socialist election victory, they 
expressed hope that President-elect Rodriguez Zapatero would 
surround himself with an experienced, moderate team that 
would keep the economy on track. 
 
4. The Ambassador took advantage of his visit to Santiago de 
Compostela to meet with Galicia President Manuel Fraga. 
Fraga has played a key role in Spanish politics since 1951, 
including service as a minister in the administrations of 
General Franco and the first monarchical government, and as 
President of Galicia since 1989.  He is known as the father 
of the Popular Party, having created its predecessor in 1977 
and served as the first head of the PP. 
 
5. As he did in every meeting, the Ambassador expressed 
condolences for the terrorist attacks of March 11.  Fraga 
said that the terrorists chose the exact moment to have 
maximum effect on the elections, noting that in the aftermath 
of the attacks, many decided voters switched sides and 
undecided voters determined to come out and vote Socialist. 
Had it not been for 3/11, the PP clearly would have won. 
When asked how the Galician government would work with the 
new administration, Fraga harkened back to the 1982-96 
Socialist administration of Felipe Gonzalez when the Galician 
government was concurrently run by the PP.  While support 
from Madrid was easier with the PP in power, \"we will work 
with the Socialists now as we did before,\" he said.  He 
characterized as \"reasonable Socialists\" Jose Bono, tapped to 
be the new Defense Minister, and Miguel Angel Moratinos, the 
probable future Foreign Minister.  Fraga commented that few 
people in Spain understood President Aznar\'s Atlanticist 
views, although Fraga himself, the son of immigrants from 
Cuba with family in Latin America, agreed that Spain must 
have strong relations with the Americas. 
 
6. When asked for his views of the outcome of the March 14 
elections, Parliamentary President Jose Maria Leira also 
referred back to the previous Socialist administration and 
stated his intention to work with the Socialists now as he 
did then.  He mused that while governance will be more 
difficult now in some ways, it can actually be easier to make 
demands of the central government when the administration is 
the opposition.  Leira criticized the Socialists\' record 
during their last stint in power, saying that unemployment 
and inflation rose while the deficit increased.  The past 8 
years of PP administration brought reduced unemployment and 
inflation as well as a balanced budget.  Leira expressed 
dismay at recent statements by a Socialist leader that the 
new administration might accept at least a short period of 
budgetary deficits.  He listed as challenges for the new 
government improving infrastructure, particularly 
communications, rail and ports. 
 
7. In a one-on-one interview with the local paper \"Voice of 
Galicia\" and short comments to reporters after his meeting 
with Fraga and his presentation at the business seminar, the 
Ambassador expressed US support for Spain in the wake of the 
March 11 terrorist attacks and pledged continued 
anti-terrorism cooperation.  He also made clear that 
regardless of who leads the Spanish government, the US and 
Spain will continue to be good friends and work together on a 
full range of issues.

SUBJECT: PROPOSED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT - SPAIN 
 
 
1. Summary: Below is the text of a proposed public 
announcement for Spain.  The EAC met today and 
determined that an updated Public Announcement was 
warranted in light of the discovery of a bomb on the 
rail line used by the high speed train connecting 
Madrid and Seville earlier today.  End Summary. 
 
2. Begin Text of Public Announcement: 
 
This Public Announcement is being issued to update U.S. 
citizens on the situation in Spain. It will expire on 
July 2, 2004. 
On April 2, 2004, railroad authorities and the Spanish 
Civil Guard discovered a ten-kilo bomb on the train 
tracks between Seville and Madrid on the high speed 
\"AVE\" train line. 
A series of bombs were detonated on commuter trains in 
the Madrid area and at the Atocha station on Thursday, 
March 11, 2004, resulting in many deaths and injuries. 
At least three Americans were among the injured. In 
December 2003 and February 2004, Spanish authorities 
thwarted other potential attacks by intercepting 
explosives and apprehending suspects believed to be 
targeting Spanish transportation lines. 
These recent terrorist incidents involving threats to 
public transportation, specifically railroads, indicate 
the need for U.S. citizens in Spain to remain alert and 
to exercise special caution in using these public 
transportation services. 
Americans living in Spain, and those contemplating 
travel to Spain, should review the Consular Information 
Sheet for Spain and Andorra and review the Worldwide 
Caution of March 23, 2004, at http://travel.state.gov 
or at the U.S. Embassy website on http://www.embusa.es 
and monitor news broadcasts. Callers in the United 
States and Canada may reach the U.S. State Department, 
Office of Overseas Citizens Services at 1-888-407-4747 
or from outside the US and Canada call 317-472-2328.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, PREL, SP, Counterterrorism 
SUBJECT: SPAIN TERRORISM UPDATE: MARCH 11 TERRORISTS BLOW 
THEMSELVES UP; ETA LEADERS CAPTURED 
 
Summary 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please Protect Accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU) Three weeks after the March 11 terror train bomb 
attacks, terrorism and the police fight against it continue 
to dominate the Spanish political and media landscape.   In 
recent days, the police scored two successes: tracking down 
the suspected leaders of the March 11 attacks to a Madrid 
suburb and, on the ETA front, working with French police to 
capture three prominent ETA members and an ETA arsenal in 
France.   The dramatic shoot-out and the suicide of five 
Islamist terrorists April 3 stunned Spain.   End Summary. 
 
Five Terrorists Kill Themselves After Shoot-out with Police 
 
2.   (SBU) Thanks to the tracing of cell phone information, 
police tracked the presumed leaders of the terror cell 
responsible for the March 11 terrorist train bombings to an 
apartment complex in Leganes, a populous  Madrid suburb, on 
April 3.   The terrorists opened fire as police approached. 
 After a two-hour standoff, the terrorists blew themselves up 
as a SWAT team (known as GEO) began to move on the apartment. 
  The front wall of the apartment was blown out. 
 
3.  (SBU) The shoot out and the terrorists\' decision to blow 
themselves up, while chanting \"God is Great,\"  stunned Spain. 
  According to the police, five terrorists were killed, 
although one of the bodies was so badly mutilated that it has 
not yet been identified.   Acting Interior Minister Angel 
Acebes announced April 4 that Serhan ben Abdelmajid Fakhet 
aka \"the Tunisian,\" the presumed leader of the cell that 
carried out the March 11 terrorist attacks, was among the 
dead terrorists.   On April 5, Acebes said that another of 
the bodies was that of Jamal Ahmidan aka the \"Chino\" another 
presumed cell leader.    Judge Juan Del Olmo had put out an 
international arrest warrant for them April 1.  Another of 
the dead terrorists, Abdennabi Kounjaa, aka Abdullah, had 
been identified by witnesses as one of those who planted 
bombs on the trains March 11.  The Spanish police GEO team 
leader was killed in the explosion and three other GEO 
seriously wounded, although they are in stable condition. 
 
GOMA 2 Explosives Same as Those Used March 11 
 
4.  (SBU) Acebes said that the explosives the terrorists used 
April 3, GOMA 2, was the same as that employed in the March 
11 train bombings and the same as the explosives that were 
left on the tracks of the Madrid-Seville AVE train on April 
2.    The detonators police found in Leganes were also the 
same as in the other cases.  Police said that at least one 
suicide belt was found on the site, along with at least 10 kg 
of unexploded GOMA 2.   In addition, machine guns found were 
the same as those displayed in a video the terrorists made 
claiming credit for the March 11 attacks. 
 
Terrorist Message: Pull Troops Out of Iraq and Afghanistan 
 
5.  (SBU)  The conservative ABC newspaper received a message 
dated April 3 from a group calling itself the \"Ansar al Qaeda 
in Europe.\"   The note, in Arabic, claimed credit for the 
March 11 attacks and the April 2 AVE train bombing attempt 
and pledged more terrorist attacks unless the GOS immediately 
pulls all Spanish troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.  If this 
is not done, the group promised to turn Spain into a \"hell\" 
and to have \"blood flowing like rivers.\"   The note 
threatened: \"we have the capacity to attack when and where we 
want.\"    Some media link the \"Tunisian\" and \"Chino\" (above) 
to Ansar al Qaeda. 
 
Success Against ETA 
 
6.  (SBU) Overshadowed by the confrontation with the March 11 
terror cell members were important successes against ETA 
April 2.    French police, with the support of the Guardia 
Civil, arrested two ETA leaders and another long-standing ETA 
member.   One of the arrested was Felix Ignacio Esparza, a 
veteran of over 20 years with ETA, who is believed to have 
been head of logistics.   Police also arrested Felix Lopez de 
la Calle aka Mobutu, a notorious veteran of 25 years with ETA 
and a leader (perhaps the top leader) in ETA\'s military wing. 
  Police believe the arrest of veteran ETA members represents 
another sign of ETA\'s weakness in the face of a police and 
judicial offensive meant to destroy the organization\'s 
operational effectiveness.   The arrests also reflect the 
depth of current Spanish-French cooperation in the fight 
against ETA.   The arrests led police to one of the largest 
ETA arsenals uncovered in recent years.   It contained 
automatic weapons, explosives, grenades, detonators, and car 
bombs. 
Three Letter Bombs 
7.  (SBU) In yet another terror incident, on April 1 Spanish 
police deactivated three letter bombs.  One was destined for 
Channel 3 TV, another for the conservative newspaper La 
Razon, and another for the radio network COPE, all located in 
Madrid.   The letters were detected by the postal service and 
did not arrive at their destinations.    Who sent them is 
unknown, though media speculate that an unidentified 
anarchist group may have been responsible. 
 
Comment 
 
8.  (SBU) As the events above illustrate, Spaniards have had 
little respite from terrorism since March 11.   Police 
successes against the March 11 terror cell and the ETA 
members are impressive.   However, the presence of Islamist 
extremists in Madrid ready and willing to commit suicide and 
determined to kill as many civilians as possible to advance 
their goals  has unsettled Spaniards, as did April 3 images 
from Iraq of Spanish troops fighting off mobs of angry 
Shiites in Najaf.

SUBJECT: Consular response to Terrorist attacks in 
Madrid on March 11, 2004:  Lessons Learned 
 
SENSITIVE 
 
1. Summary:  March 11, 2004, eleven bombs went off in 
Madrid, killing 191 people and injuring almost 1,500 in 
a series of attacks on commuter trains coming into 
Madrid and at three separate train stations between 
7:30 and 8:00 am.  Both the Consular Section and 
Embassy went into immediate action.  The Consular 
Section had three major goals the first day: obtaining 
information, communicating that information, and 
providing assistance.  By the second day, those goals 
changed to: providing assistance, verifying 
information, and communicating broader information.  In 
addition, attaining information about the alleged 
perpetrators was essential so the visa unit could check 
for lookout information we might have on those 
individuals.  The following is a summary of actions 
taken by the consular section in response to the 
terrorist attack, and we hope can serve as a helpful 
framework for other consular sections.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Obtaining Information 
--------------------- 
 
2.  The consular section immediately recognized their 
need to know what had happened and if there were any 
American citizen victims.  We came together as a group 
for a brief meeting at OOB, we shared the information 
we had individually gathered, and specific tasks were 
assigned.  All of us were in shock, many concerned 
about family and friends, and coming together as a 
section initially was an important first step. Through 
regular group meetings and clear assignment of duties, 
everyone contributed to our ability to respond as a 
team to the crisis. Some staff performed regular duties 
like interviewing the visa and passport applicants who 
appeared for service.  Processing these routine walk- 
ins and pre-scheduled visa interviews, was critical to 
providing a semblance of normality and freed up other 
staff to focus on crisis response tasks.  We recognized 
that it was vitally important that everyone felt he/she 
was doing valuable work and through the clear 
designation of tasks and maintaining office 
communication through frequent short meetings to touch 
base, the sense of teamwork was enhanced. 
 
     -One FSN tracked news reports and recorded solid 
     leads and factual development.  Radio and TV 
     monitors in the Consular Section were tuned into 
     different major news sources.  They provided us 
     with a source of immediate information and 
     prevented us from falling behind in communal 
     updates.  One FSN\'s task was to gather and 
     corroborate the information coming from the 
     various sources allowing us to be sure we had 
     accurate and timely information. 
 
     -Each person was asked to reach out to his/her 
     best contacts in local police, media and emergency 
     assistance providers.  (For example, someone might 
     have had a friend/relative working at the train 
     station or in the press at the scene.)  These 
     informal contacts created a network of resources 
     for information, which was not available through 
     media broadcasts. 
 
     -Given that we have a large number of student 
     groups, we had our intern reach out to directors 
     of major university programs to ask them to 
     confirm the welfare of their students.  We could 
     use this information in responding to calls, e.g. 
     Syracuse University, NYU, Arizona State, Oberlin, 
     etc. have been contacted and confirmed all their 
     students are OK.  (Throughout the year we maintain 
     an active outreach program with the Universities, 
     and the good contacts with program directors 
     really helped us in this situation.) 
 
     -Throughout the day we used an email collective 
     among consular section chiefs in Madrid to share 
     information continually, touching base on reported 
     injuries/deaths and on travel advice. 
 
     -One FSN and one FSO kept track of all the call-in 
     sheets (see item on Talking Points below), to see 
     if any likely victims could be identified from 
     information provided by callers. 
 
     -The Spanish government put a list of injured 
     victims who had been identified on the Internet. 
     We were able to search that site and provide the 
     reference to callers so they could check 
     personally. 
 
     -The FSOs began running the Internet list of 
     injured victims through PIERS to see if we could 
     find any matches. We would print out and call 
     likely matches, and we were able to eliminate a 
     number of possible victims in this way, when we 
     could confirm that the match in PIERS was safe and 
     sound.  FSNs ran any possible hits through the ACS 
     registration system 
 
     -About 3pm, the CG and Senior ACS FSN went to the 
     three major hospitals providing assistance to the 
     majority of victims and to the morgue to search 
     for American victims.  We offered to be alert to 
     other foreign victims who might come to our 
     attention, and told the other consular section 
     chiefs at other embassies in Madrid through our CG 
     email collective. 
 
------------------------- 
Communicating Information 
------------------------- 
 
3.  We found that obtaining information and 
communicating that information regularly were 
inextricably linked.  Both the Department and the front 
office were eager for any concrete information about 
victims.  We provided regular reports throughout the 
day. 
 
     -First we called the Operations Center and asked 
     to speak to the Consular Duty officer to inform 
     her of the bombings.  We had limited information, 
     but this served as a heads up to establish a line 
     of communication. 
 
     -Each section/agency in the embassy was asked to 
     confirm that all staff were accounted for.  We 
     told everyone in the embassy to call home to be 
     sure our families were ok and to inform our 
     families of our own well being. 
 
     -We contacted colleagues at other embassies in 
     Madrid through an email collective among consular 
     section chiefs, which was already established and 
     active.  This group was very supportive and email 
     allowed us to keep track without waiting for calls 
     to go through.  Phone systems were disrupted most 
     of the day. 
 
     -The Embassy held an early morning briefing and 
     arranged for an all agency EAC for early 
     afternoon. 
 
     -The Ambassador held an embassy wide town meeting 
     in the afternoon. 
 
     -We drafted talking points for callers, with a 
     standard set of questions attached:  Who is 
     calling, who are you calling about, why are you 
     concerned (i.e. what makes you think your 
     friend/relative might have been in the train), 
     contact information for all parties, date and time 
     of the call and who took the call.  These talking 
     points were distributed throughout the embassy and 
     sent to OCS for them to send on to the US phone 
     information line.  We wanted to provide 
     information and obtain information efficiently and 
     to keep track of everything in a usable format. 
 
     -We turned the talking points into a Warden 
     message, had it cleared with the duty officer, and 
     included in the message the request that everyone 
     should call home to let family/friends know they 
     were ok. 
 
     -We continued to meet as a group in the consular 
     section every hour or so to update each other on 
     information and activities. 
 
     -We updated the talking points to address the most 
     frequently asked questions; and we sent a second, 
     updated Warden message in the afternoon.  We 
     provided the updated information to OCS so they 
     could give it to the OCS information contractor. 
 
     -We created a roster for after-hours work and 
     double-checked our home phone/cell phone telephone 
     tree list. 
 
     -We confirmed the instructions for sending Warden 
     messages so anyone could activate the warden email 
     and fax lists, not just the staff normally 
     assigned.  This meant the folks on the duty roster 
     had tools necessary if needed. 
 
     -We touched base with other consular operations in 
     country via email and phone (Consulate General 
     Barcelona and six consular agencies).  We felt the 
     email contact worked best to ensure everyone had 
     the same information, but follow-up phone calls 
     were effective in reassuring our colleagues we 
     were fine.  It also meant we had them on tap for 
     additional assistance if needed.  We also needed 
     to be sure they were not experiencing any 
     difficulties. 
     -We kept in touch with OCS regularly by phone and 
     email throughout the day.  A series of meetings 
     throughout the day were held with other embassy 
     sections.  Short, focused meetings worked best. 
 
     -Upon return from the hospitals and morgue, about 
     9:30 pm, the CG had a meeting with about ten 
     consular staff working late, called the Ambassador 
     and Consular Duty officer in the Department and 
     sent a short email to OCS. 
 
     -The day after the attacks in coordination with 
     OCS, we issued an updated CIS and a Public 
     Announcement on the acts of violence, addressing 
     travel concerns. 
 
     -The following Monday the CG went to Alcala de 
     Henares, where about 200 Americans are studying, 
     for a group meeting. This was the point of origin 
     of the trains, and the students were appreciative 
     of the personal outreach and reassurance. 
 
-------------------- 
Providing Assistance 
-------------------- 
 
  4.   We identified three American victims of the 
attack. Fortunately all three suffered relatively minor 
physical Injuries, and there were no reported deaths. 
Once the individuals were identified (using the 
Internet lists, PIERS, and personal contacts), we 
called them to make initial contact. 
 
     -We contacted possible victims and/or emergency 
     contacts using the information on passports / 
     registration lists and PIERS.  We were able to 
     eliminate some individuals with name match in this 
     way as they or their family confirmed they were 
     not in Madrid at the time. 
 
     -We asked the victims to come in.  The first 
     victim who came in actually arrived to apply for a 
     replacement passport.   One was hesitant to use 
     public transportation, but did come in on Monday 
     even though we offered to come to her.  The third 
     has been in contact by phone only and is still 
     hesitant to get on the public transportation. 
 
     -The Legat at post wanted to talk with American 
     victims.  We made those contact arrangements.  We 
     also identified another American who was in the 
     train but not physically injured. 
 
     -We requested expedited processing for family 
     members of affected people should they need 
     passports in the US.  The DAS/PPT sent a message 
     to all PPT agency directors to expedite emergency 
     issuance and waive the expedite fees. 
 
     -When it became clear that many victims were South 
     Americans, we asked VO to assist in getting a 
     message to all WHA posts to request expeditious 
     visa processing for family/friends if needed.  VO 
     sent an ALDAC to WHA posts. 
 
     -We continue to maintain contact and follow up 
     with the American victims. 
 
----------- 
Visa Issues 
----------- 
 
5.  As the Spanish law enforcement officials began to 
identify, arrest and pursue suspects, we worked with 
other agencies in the embassy to obtain specific 
identifying information so we could run name checks 
through the CCD and check our own issuance records 
We were disturbed to note that none of the names we 
ran resulted in hits based on prior Visas Viper 
Submissions.   We learned that one person had been 
issued a visa (not one of the principal 
suspects), and we pulled up the application and 
provided it to the VO duty officer, the RSO, DS duty 
officer, Legat and others requesting with a need to 
know.  We reviewed our issuance practices, management 
review of cases, and provided a context to those 
requesting the applications so they could better 
understand how we adjudicate cases and make our 
decisions.  For example, the issuance was to a non 
Spanish citizen, but in the six weeks preceding the 
bomb attacks, we had adjudicated applications from 90 
different nationalities.  This information was 
essential for non-consular/visa officials to 
understand why we might have 
issued this individual. 
 
-------------------- 
Organizing Ourselves 
-------------------- 
 
6.  One of the basic lessons learned for us, was 
reviewing how we organized ourselves to accomplish our 
goals. 
 
     -      Regular meetings:  We gathered regularly 
        with different groups, large and small.  The 
        meetings were short and specific goals were 
        important.  However, coming together as a 
        group helped us keep a feeling of teamwork as 
        we went about our individual tasks. 
 
     -     Clear specific tasking:  Each person needed 
        to be clear on his/her role.  This enabled us 
        to concentrate, bring specifics to the 
        meetings, and not get distracted with 
        peripheral things. 
 
     -     Created roster for after-hours work, 
        confirmed home and cell phone numbers.  The 
        people who could stay, did, those with family 
        commitments could leave. We knew who could be 
        called in for back up, those needing rest 
        could get it. 
 
     -     Email collectives - This was very important 
        for efficient communications especially when 
        you want to get information distributed but 
        phone lines are disrupted.  Very efficient for 
        getting clear information in brief format. 
 
     -      Wearing identifying tags: When we went to 
        the sites we used badge like tags to identify 
        ourselves. This way people could identify us 
        as US government officials/employees and could 
        approach us for assistance if needed.  We had 
        tags pre-made from when we went to the airport 
        after 9/11 
 
     -     Taking care of each other - We brought in 
        food to share.  The Ambassador brought us 
        dinner the first night from his own kitchen. 
        We sent tired people home.  We supported 
        people when they were in distress and let 
        ourselves cry if needed.  We tried to see when 
        someone needed a quiet supportive talk and to 
        pull individuals aside to talk it out a bit 
        when they looked in need. We still need this 
        as the stress and anxiety has been continuing 
        and we need to be sure renew our reserves 
        physically and psychically in the event 
        further events occur. 
 
--------------- 
Lessons Learned 
--------------- 
 
7.  Outreach and good contacts show their value in a 
crisis situation.  Regular communication is essential. 
Taking care of each other is vital.  Being in a country 
with a strong infrastructure makes your job a lot 
easier.  Let\'s hope no other post in the world needs 
this summary.

SUBJECT: ZAPATERO AND SPANISH TROOPS IN IRAQ: POLITICAL 
PRESSURES FOR WITHDRAWAL 
 
Classified By: Charge J. Robert Manzanares per 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
Summary 
 
1.  (C) Political pressure is high on incoming Socialist 
President Rodriguez Zapatero to fulfill his campaign promise 
to pull the 1300 Spanish troops out of Iraq absent a new UN 
mandate giving the UN the lead role.  Zapatero is on the hook 
to demonstrate to his supporters that his surprise election 
March 14 ushered in a significant change from the Aznar 
years.   Zapatero, who vehemently opposed the Iraq war, has 
repeatedly emphasized, publicly and privately, that he will 
comply with his campaign promises.  The clearest way to 
manifest this would be to pull the troops out.   Nonetheless, 
the Socialists are sensitive to charges a Spanish withdrawal 
following the March 11 Madrid terror attacks would appear to 
be cutting and running in the face of terror.    A new UNSCR 
giving the UN a lead role might provide Zapatero with cover 
to keep the troops in, but what exactly Zapatero can accept 
remains vague since he has not defined it.  We expect him to 
take his cues from France and Germany.    Public opinion in 
the wake of March 11 regards Spain as being in the line of 
Jihadist fire because of the Aznar government\'s Iraq policy 
and favors withdrawal.   Recent fighting in Najaf between 
Spanish forces and Shiite extremists has heightened concerns 
about the Iraq deployment.  Significant Spanish losses there 
could clinch the decision to pull out.   End Summary. 
 
The Case for Withdrawal 
 
2.  (C) Zapatero has been vehemently against the Iraq war 
from the beginning.  He has consistently maintained that the 
war was founded on lies, and is immoral and illegal.    Many 
of the 11 million Spaniards who voted for the Socialists on 
March 14 share his view.    Many Socialists, especially those 
on the left, want the troops out now regardless of a UN 
resolution.   As far as Spanish opinion as a whole, according 
to a radio (Cadena Ser) poll last week, 38% of respondents 
favored Spanish troops staying in Iraq if there were a new UN 
mandate while 42% favor pulling the troops out even if the UN 
takes control of Iraq.    Only a small percentage favor the 
troops staying under the current mandate.   Many Socialists 
are uncomfortable with the assertive international role for 
Spain that Aznar espoused and, since the March 11 attacks, 
believe Aznar\'s alliance with the US put Spain in the direct 
line of fire for Islamist terrorists. 
 
Caving in to Terrorists? 
 
3.  (C) The Socialists are, however, sensitive to the charge 
that withdrawal from Iraq means caving in to terrorist 
blackmail following March 11.   They note that Zapatero\'s 
pledge to withdraw long predated March 11 (though the 
Socialists would not have been elected had the March 11 
attacks not taken place).  Jose Blanco, Socialist Party 
National Coordinator, noted on April 6: \"Let\'s not mix apples 
and oranges.  One thing is terrorism which has to be fought 
on all fronts.   Another thing is our politics concerning the 
war in Iraq.   Politically we shouldn\'t link one thing with 
the other.\"  Popular sentiment, however, does link them. 
Many believe Spain is now exposed to jihadist terrorism as a 
result of a military deployment in Iraq that most Spaniards 
oppose. 
 
4.  (C) Antiterrorism marchers numbering 25,000 turned out 
April 5 in Leganes, the site of the April 3 shootout and 
suicide of the suspected leaders of the March 11 Madrid 
terror attacks.  The march underlined that many Spaniards do 
link the March 11 terror attacks to Spain\'s presence in Iraq. 
 The communique for the march, at the urging of the Socialist 
mayor of Leganes, included an explicit call for Spain to 
withdraw its troops from Iraq.   (This prompted Aznar\'s 
Popular Party to boycott the march and organize its own on 
April 6).   The message that came out of the April 5 rally 
was that since Spaniards never wanted to be in Iraq in the 
first place, Spain should withdraw, lower its profile, and 
thereby remove itself as a target.   Images of the Shiite 
riots in Najaf and elsewhere further agitated Spanish opinion 
against Spain\'s presence in Iraq, as did reports that Spanish 
troops returned fire on rioters in Najaf April 4, killing 
about 20. 
 
UN Resolution Giving UN a Lead Role 
 
5.  (C) FM designate Moratinos has been in the lead in 
holding up the possibility that a new UNSCR giving the UN the 
leading role in the Iraq could satisfy Zapatero\'s electoral 
pledge.   However, Zapatero and his key political advisors 
such as Jose Blanco and Jesus Caldera, have been less forward 
leaning than Moratinos.   The posture of France and Germany 
on a new resolution should be important, since Zapatero has 
made it clear that he wants to follow their lead.   If France 
and Germany are on board, Zapatero will feel pressure to 
follow suit.   One prominent commentator, well connected in 
the PSOE, noted to us that if, for example, France were 
willing to commit troops to Iraq under a new UNSCR, Zapatero 
would be able to show that the situation had fundamentally 
changed and keep Spanish troops there. 
 
Comment 
 
6.  (C) Indications are that Zapatero has not made a final 
decision on what to do about the troops.    The \"pull the 
troops out\" sentiment from his base, and which his key 
political advisors share, will be a critical factor weighing 
on him.   For Zapatero, the easiest scenario would be no new 
UN resolution, which would mean he would have no choice but 
to pull the troops out.  A UN resolution expanding the UN 
role will force him to make a choice.    In this case, 
Zapatero\'s allies in the all important Prisa media group 
might be able to help him sell the line that he had won by 
successfully pushing for an increased UN role and give him 
cover to keep the troops in.   Zapatero may also be 
susceptible to the argument that, whatever the rationale or 
lack thereof for the war, undercutting the coalition now 
could prove disastrous.   Nonetheless, escalation of fighting 
in Southern Iraq, particularly if Spanish forces suffer 
significant losses, may clinch the decision in favor of 
withdrawal.

SUBJECT: INVESTITURE SCHEDULE FOR SPAIN\'S NEW SOCIALIST 
GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: A. MADRID 1072 
 
     B. MADRID 900 
 
1. Summary.  Spain\'s Congress of Deputies is slated to begin 
the investiture sessions to install the new Socialist 
government on April 15.  Depending on whether the Socialist 
leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, receives an absolute 
majority or not on the first vote, he could be sworn in as 
President of the Government as early as April 17.  Zapatero\'s 
government likely will be sworn in and functioning on April 
19, and he is expected to hold his first cabinet meeting a 
day or two thereafter.  The formal opening session of the new 
Congress, presided over by the King, is then expected to take 
place on April 22.  End summary. 
 
2. The Congress of Deputies is scheduled to begin the 
investiture sessions to install the new President of the 
Government on April 15.  The sessions will include statements 
from all parliamentary groups, with speeches slated to 
continue into April 16.  At the conclusion of the group 
speeches on April 16, the Congress will vote on the proposed 
candidate, Socialist Party leader Jose Luis Rodriguez 
Zapatero.  If his candidacy wins with an absolute majority, 
Zapatero should be sworn in as President of the Government in 
front of the King on Saturday, April 17.  At that time, he 
would officially inform the King of the members of his 
Cabinet. 
 
3.  If Zapatero does not receive an absolute majority on the 
April 16 vote, a second voting session would be held on April 
18.  For the second round of voting, Zapatero would only need 
a simple majority to be invested.  His swearing in before the 
King would then be held late on April 18 or on Monday, April 
19. 
 
4. In either voting scenario, the King is expected to convene 
the Solemn Opening Session of the new Legislature on April 
22, at which point the new Socialist majority will begin to 
govern.  Between the swearing-in ceremony and the Solemn 
Opening Session of Congress, Zapatero\'s ministers will have 
their names published in the Official State Bulletin, swear 
allegiance to the Constitution, and take possession of their 
Ministries on April 19. 
 
5. The Socialist Party\'s new Parliamentary spokesman, Alfredo 
Perez Rubalcaba, stated yesterday that he believed Zapatero 
would receive an absolute majority on the first round of 
voting.  Although the Socialists only have firm commitments 
from the United Left party and the Aragon regional party, 
Rubalcaba expected to also receive first-round support from 
the ERC (leftist Catalan nationalists), the Canaries 
Coalition and the BNG (Galician nationalists).  This would 
give the Socialists more than the 176 votes required for an 
absolute majority.

In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. 
In the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel/state.gov.  In addition to information on the 
Internet, U.S. travelers can hear recorded information by 
calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at 
202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, or receive 
information by automated telefax by dialing 202-647-3000 from 
their fax machine.

SUBJECT: TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EU EXPANSION: SPANISH PRIVATE 
SECTOR MUSING 
 
REF:  MADRID 00565 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  In a recent report, Spain\'s largest employers\' 
organization, the Confederacion Espanola de Organizaciones 
Empresariales (CEOE), highlighted the challenges and 
opportunities for Spain presented by EU enlargement. 
Opportunities include potential for increased trade and 
investment, while challenges center on strategies to offset 
the competitive advantages of candidate countries, ranging 
from lower wages to weaker regulations.  The CEOE study 
proposed an action plan that Spanish businesses from various 
sectors of Spain\'s economy could implement in order to face 
these challenges.  The report holds that enlargement will 
only have a plus or minus 0.3% effect on Spain\'s GDP. 
Whether the impact is positive or negative will depend on 
the seriousness of the business community\'s efforts to 
prepare for the challenges of enlargement.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  CEOE, Spain\'s largest employers\' organization, recently 
published a report that analyzes the implications of 
European enlargement for the Spanish private sector.  In 
addition to touching upon general themes such as what the EU- 
15 and candidate countries need to do to guarantee a smooth 
and successful integration, the report addresses reforms 
that Spanish companies should introduce to take advantage of 
enlargement, and makes recommendations for dealing with the 
upcoming challenges.  Bottom line, CEOE believes that the 
Spanish economy could avoid the negative impacts of EU 
enlargement if the Spanish business community prepares well. 
Contrary to many predictions, the CEOE report puts the 
economic effect of expansion at a small plus or minus 0.3% 
of Spain\'s GDP, but whether Spain\'s economy gains or loses 
depends on the efforts of Spanish businesses. 
 
---------- 
CHALLENGES 
---------- 
 
3.  Despite new business opportunities, there are challenges 
for the Spanish economy.  The competitive advantages of the 
acceding countries will attract foreign investment away from 
Spain and increase competition with Spanish products. 
Competitive advantages are not limited to lower wages, but 
also include lower non-tariff trade barriers, higher fiscal 
incentives, and, at least temporarily, unfair government 
subsidies that are deemed by CEOE contrary to EU 
regulations.  Lower standards for environmental protection, 
food safety, consumer protection, work environment, 
intellectual and industrial property protection, and trade 
and labor laws also lower business costs. 
 
4.  Additionally, Spain will loose EU cohesion funds after 
EU expansion.  Currently, Spain is the biggest net 
beneficiary of EU funds.  Spain received in absolute terms 
some 8 billion Euros last year ($9.6 billion at a rate of 
EUR 1=USD 1.21).  As EU funds are directed to new members, 
the Spanish government will have to take on the burden of 
funding infrastructure improvements. 
 
5.  Thanks to rising foreign investment, competitiveness of 
the Spanish workforce has increased, yielding a high level 
of value-added production and increased automation.  As a 
result, the risk of withdrawal of businesses and foreign 
investments may not be as high as once feared, easing the 
worries about negative aggregate effects on Spanish 
production and employment. 
 
------------- 
OPPORTUNITIES 
------------- 
 
6.  EU member countries have high expectations for the 
growth of their economies as a result of the EU enlargement. 
Spain, like its EU-15 counterparts, anticipates that the 
induction of the candidate countries will increase trade and 
investment.  Most significantly, investment in 
infrastructure in the candidate countries will offer new 
prospects for large construction and high-tech 
infrastructure companies of the EU-15.  For example, EU-15 
companies have already successfully installed mobile phone 
networks in candidate states.  The International Director of 
CEOE told us that Spanish companies are familiar with the EU 
contract process from years of completing EU-financed 
projects and should therefore have an advantage in bidding 
on infrastructure contracts. 
 
----------- 
ACTION PLAN 
----------- 
 
7.  According to the CEOE, as the inauguration date 
approaches, current member states should realize that EU 
enlargement is not a one-way process.  Enlargement will 
require changes in both the candidate countries and the EU- 
15.  If Spanish business leaders want to benefit from the 
opportunities while minimizing their exposure to risks, they 
need to specialize in products of high technology and value 
and focus on international markets.   Spanish businesses 
should also adopt new technologies, foment Research and 
Development (R&D), develop human resources, improve 
infrastructure, and shape policies to attract foreign 
investment. 
 
8.  To reap benefits from enlargement, Spain will need to 
improve its business relations with the candidate countries. 
Spain\'s trade with Eastern Europe has increased in recent 
years, but business relations are weak compared with other 
EU member states.  If Spain wants to penetrate these markets 
it should increase foreign direct investment in these 
countries.  While Spanish presence in some sectors (like 
fisheries) will come easily, entry into many equally 
profitable sectors will require new business strategies. 
 
------------------ 
SECTORAL ANALYSIS 
------------------ 
 
9.  METAL INDUSTRY.  This sector is especially sensitive to 
EU enlargement.  The main concern is how cheaper imports of 
metals from candidate countries will affect the Spanish 
metal sector.  Further, competition stemming from new 
members may affect Spain\'s share of the EU market.  Spanish 
producers should focus on increasing their productivity by 
investing in R&D, increasing the product quality of their 
metals and relocating some production abroad. 
 
10.  AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY.  Currently, the majority of 
Spanish automobile production is exported to the EU-15. 
With a larger internal EU market after enlargement, there 
will be more sales prospects.  However, Spanish auto 
producers will need to reduce costs as other auto-makers 
will take advantage of lower labor costs and fiscal 
incentives in the new member states while moving closer to 
larger markets of Central Europe.  The relocation of 
production outside of Spain is already happening, as several 
car plants have relocated to Slovakia (reftel).  However, 
high automation of automobile plants in Spain leads CEOE to 
predict that only 15% of the automotive workforce will be 
affected.  At the same time, Spain may counterbalance some 
of the relocation of factories with its increasingly skilled 
workforce.  Eventually, wages will converge, and with the 
final elimination of fiscal incentives, competition will be 
carried out on a more even playing field. 
 
11.  CONSUMER ELECTRONICS.  Many multinational electronic 
producers have moved production abroad to lower wage 
locations to reduce production costs.  To maintain its 
remaining electronics workforce, Spain will have to turn to 
higher value products by investing in R&D and making better 
use of its skilled workers-in short, increase productivity 
in this sector. 
 
12.  CHEMICALS.  In the chemical industry, competition may 
arise from candidate countries that make primary materials 
for pharmaceuticals.  Lower wages in candidate countries 
could also negatively affect the Spanish pharmaceutical 
industry.  Spanish pharmaceuticals should venture into 
higher-value products by investing in R&D and taking 
advantage of the larger market.  In regards to chemical 
products for industry and consumers, demand in the new 
markets will increase, providing prospects for higher-end 
Spanish products such as paints, detergents, fragrances and 
cosmetics. 
 
13.  TOURISM.  Due to its strong position in world tourism, 
the Spanish tourist industry does not foresee any short-term 
adverse affects from EU enlargement.  In the medium-term, 
candidate countries that have beaches and sun could take 
away some of Spain\'s market.  In the long run, higher 
incomes of citizens of these countries will only benefit the 
Spanish tourism market.  To attract these new customers, 
Spain will need to improve and diversify its services. 
 
14.  AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PRODUCTS.  Spain will have to take 
into account that after the second phase of the integration 
process, the EU agricultural budget will be divided amongst 
twenty-five members.  In the medium term, as Eastern 
European producers incorporate technology in their dairy and 
beef production, there will be tougher competition for 
Spanish producers.  On the other hand, EU enlargement 
provides opportunities for the Mediterranean region. 
Spanish agricultural producers should take advantage of the 
new markets where there is an increasing demand for 
processed food products rather than primary agricultural 
products. 
 
15.  FISHERIES.  Spain\'s fishing industry produces more than 
twice the amount of the combined production of the ten 
candidate countries.  In the short-run the new members will 
not be able to export fish products due to non-compliance 
with EU sanitary standards.  Thus, the enlarged market can 
only have a positive impact on the Spanish fishing industry. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16.  In predicting a minor impact on Spanish GDP of plus or 
minus 0.3%, the CEOE is more optimistic about expansion than 
many observers.  CEOE\'s report is unique in that it is the 
only one we have seen that offers specific advice to 
individual sectors on how to deal with the opportunities and 
challenges of expansion.  Clearly, the degree to which 
Spanish businesses heed that advice will largely determine 
whether they gain or lose from enlargement.

SUBJECT: SPANISH DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE COMMITTED TO 
ECONOMIC REFORM AGENDA 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. Over lunch with the DCM and Economic 
Counselor May 3, Secretary of State for Budget and Finance 
Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez expressed his strong 
commitment to continued fiscal restraint and pushing forward 
Spain\'s economic reform agenda to spur competitiveness and 
enhance Spanish productivity.  He strongly criticized the 
previous Aznar government\'s opacity in handling domestic 
budget and other economic policy issues, promising 
transparency would be the leitmotif for Pedro Solbes as Vice 
President and Minister of Economy and Finance.  Fernandez 
Ordonez voiced admiration for the transparency of the U.S. 
budget process and publication of economic statistics and 
expressed his eagerness to learn more about IRS, OMB and 
Treasury practices which could be transferable to the Spanish 
context. Despite his enthusiasm, we believe Fernandez Ordonez 
will face a difficult time maintaining budget discipline as 
recently appointed ministers call for new expensive measures 
on an almost daily basis.  He will need to set the tone early 
and firmly if he is to succeed in maintaining fiscal 
discipline in the new government.  End Summary. 
 
Budget Policy -- A Delicate Balancing Act 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) We met for lunch May 3 with the new number two at 
the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Miguel Angel Fernandez 
Ordonez. A long time admirer of the US and veteran of 
previous Socialist administrations, Fernandez Ordonez 
stressed his commitment to pursuing sound fiscal policy as 
the senior Ministry official responsible for developing 
budget and tax policy.  Fernandez Ordonez credited the former 
Aznar administration with selling the importance of sound 
fiscal policy to the Spanish electorate, which he believed 
would not stand for loose budget deficits outside the 
framework of EU rules. 
 
3.  (SBU) To his dismay, however, Fernandez Ordonez said he 
was discovering many \"under the table\" budget deals had been 
struck by the former government, particularly with the 
autonomous regions.  The deals provided him with less 
flexibility to manage budget policy than he had anticipated. 
The prior government had been very good at lowering taxes but 
not very good about decreasing expenditures.  In response to 
our questions about how he planned to finance the many 
potentially expensive campaign commitments while maintaining 
budget discipline, Fernandez Ordonez said some expenditure 
cuts would have to be made to finance the new programs -- and 
not all of the new programs would be implemented immediately. 
 He denied the government had plans to cut defence spending 
by four billion euros to fund these programs as suggested by 
some media reports.  The Deputy Minister said he will propose 
that the government privatize as soon as possible the 
publicly-owned and heavily indebted Spanish Radio and 
Television Corporation (RTVE) as a source of revenue for 
these projects.  He also hoped to cut coal subsidies and 
introduce more financial discipline into the national 
railroad (RENFE) high speed train plans.  Fernandez Ordonez 
cited housing, more funding for R&D and an increase in 
university scholarships as the programs likely to be funded 
first.  The first was a key election commitment and the 
latter two would help improve Spain\'s lagging productivity. 
 
4. (SBU) Fernandez Ordonez said he was committed to 
transparency in the conduct of budget policy.  Toward this 
end, the Zapatero government planned to establish a budget 
office in Parliament styled on the Congressional Budget 
Office.  A campaign pledge, this office would help members of 
parliament understand the budgets on which they voted, 
improving the credibility of the entire process. 
 
Reform:  Full Speed Ahead 
------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  Sharply critical of the Aznar government\'s 
commitment to economic reform during its second term in 
office, Fernandez Ordonez claimed the former government\'s 
philosophy was \"believe what I say not what I do.\"   For 
example, liberalization of the electricity sector was more 
words than deeds as two companies continued to dominate the 
sector.  Privatization became a way to place friends -- 
witness Cesar Alierta\'s placement at Telefonica -- rather 
than the introduction of true competition.  In hindsight, the 
opposition should have demanded that the Aznar government set 
up independent regulatory frameworks before privatization of 
these companies.  In the latter years of the Aznar 
government, there was no attempt to reform social security, 
pensions or labor practices. 
 
6.  (SBU) Fernandez Ordonez said the Zapatero government was 
committed to pushing ahead with these reforms.  Improving 
competitiveness and productivity would be essential to 
continued strong levels of economic growth.  In the past, 
Spain had always improved its competitiveness by devaluation. 
 He attributed the reluctance of small and medium-sized 
businesses (SMEs) to invest in new technology to improve 
competitiveness to this pattern.  Experience showed they 
could still sell abroad without such investments.  As a 
participating country in the euro, this option was no longer 
possible.  The only answer was reform. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Fernandez Ordonez seemed confident that the 
Socialist government found itself in a better position to 
introduce more flexibility in the Spanish labor market than 
its predecessor.  He pointed to comments by the head of one 
of Spain\'s main unions over the weekend, in which the labor 
leader listed his demands of the new government but cautioned 
that the government couldn\'t possibly grant all the union\'s 
wishes without hurting the economy.  In response to our 
question about a PSOE government\'s potential squeamishness 
about increased unemployment that might come in the wake of 
these reforms, Fernandez Ordonez appeared confident the 
government would weather any initial deterioration in the 
unemployment figures.  He compared Spain favorably to Germany 
or France in that Spaniards still had a drive to change and 
understood further changes would be necessary to keep the 
economy growing. 
Willing to Learn From US 
------------------------ 
 
8.  (U) Fernandez Ordonez said in his previous jobs he tried 
to learn from the US and apply those lessons in Spain.  He 
cited his close relations with the Federal Trade Commission 
when he chaired the Spanish competition tribunal as one 
example.  Fernandez Ordonez said he hoped to travel to the US 
within a few months and meet with is counterparts at 
Treasury, the IRS and elsewhere.  He offered that if we 
identified any U.S. budget or tax practices which we thought 
could improve transparency and efficiency in Spain we should 
feel free to provide him with information. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Despite his optimism and passion when discussing 
sound macroeconomic policies, we believe Fernandez Ordonez 
faces a tough road ahead.  In the few short weeks the 
Zapatero government has been in power, many new ministers 
have announced potentially expensive and clearly unvetted 
policy initiatives -- such as a cut in the VAT for books and 
movies or increased subsidies to mothers with young children 
-- only to walk these statements back a few days later.  We 
understand that Solbes will be delegating heavily to 
Fernandez Ordonez, whom many have already picked to replace 
Solbes (who is rumored to be in poor health and only to have 
committed to the job for two years) if he succeeds in his 
bold agenda of fiscal discipline and further economic reform. 
To do so, Fernandez Ordonez will need to be agressive in 
establishing his authority and have the clear backing of 
President Zapatero\'s office.

Director of UN Affairs, on May 5.  De Palacio stated at the 
time that Spain was still looking with interest at whether 
the Palestinians would accept the EU\'s suggested changes to 
the resolution.  He said that the matter was one of personal 
interest to Spanish FM Moratinos (who was in Dublin for the 
Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference), and that the MFA 
would receive its orders on how to vote directly from him. 
De Palacio later phoned us on May 6 to say that the great 
majority of EU countries were in favor of voting for the 
amended Palestinian resolution and that Spain would vote in 
favor or abstain on the resolution, though the final decision 
had not yet been reached.  We will update with any further 
developments.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, ETRD, KIPR, SP, Trade Issues, American - Spanish Relations 
SUBJECT: NEW SPANISH MINISTER OF INDUSTRY WANTS STRONG 
BILATERAL COMMERCIAL RELATIONS 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: In his May 5 courtesy call on new Minister of 
Industry, Tourism and Commerce Jose Montilla, the Ambassador 
raised USG concerns on protection of intellectual property 
rights (IPR) in Spain.  The Ambassador also asked Montilla if 
rumors are true that the new administration is considering a 
policy of cultural exception.  Montilla said the government 
is currently considering \"incentives\" to help the domestic 
film industry.  Montilla expressed regret that the Spanish 
Governing Council of Chambers of Commerce chose to cancel the 
CPA conference on sub-contracting in Iraq, but noted that GOS 
will maintain its participation in the Iraq Core Group and 
will comply with its Iraq Donors\' Conference pledges towards 
Iraq Reconstruction. END SUMMARY 
 
2. In a cordial May 5 courtesy call on Minister of Industry, 
Tourism and Commerce Jose Montilla, the Ambassador and DCM 
congratulated Montilla on his new position and told him we 
hoped to work closely with the new government.  The 
Ambassador noted we had done much to inspire more research 
and development in Spain and offered to continue this 
cooperation.  Montilla said the new administration was intent 
on maintaining excellent bilateral relations with the United 
States.  He also anticipated continued strong commercial 
ties.   He noted the removal of the troops from Iraq was a 
campaign promise the current government felt an obligation to 
honor, and should not be interpreted in a way that might harm 
our bilateral relationship. 
 
3. The Ambassador raised USG concerns on IPR protection in 
Spain.  He briefed Montilla on the outcome of this year\'s 
Special 301 decision (Spain was not listed), but noted that 
the industry is troubled with the continued high rate of 
piracy.  He urged the new minister to take this problem 
seriously and engage aggressively to combat the problem. 
Montilla said the new administration was committed to 
fighting IP crime, noting that piracy hurts not just U.S. 
interests but Spanish as well. 
 
4. The Ambassador also mentioned press reports indicating 
that the new administration planned to limit American and 
other foreign films in Spain in an effort to bolster their 
own film industry.  Montilla did not deny the rumor.  He said 
Spanish government is looking at potential incentives to help 
the domestic film industry.  He noted Spain is not alone in 
this as the French Government is contemplating similar 
measures.  He anticipates it will take some time for a policy 
on this to be finalized, but whatever measures are taken will 
be taken in an open and transparent manner and within the 
framework of the EU. 
 
5. Montilla expressed regret that the Madrid stop on the CPA 
Iraq sub-contracting road show had been canceled.  He noted 
he had given the Spanish Governing Council of Chambers of 
Commerce (the Consejo) assurances that he supported the 
conference and had hoped they would sponsor it, however they 
were concerned as he was not yet officially in place as 
minister.  Once the new government announced its intention to 
pull Spanish troops from Iraq, the Consejo\'s anxiety 
increased and its leadership decided to withdraw its 
sponsorship.  Montilla said the decision was made because of 
uncertainties created by the transition and should not be 
interpreted as Spain pulling back from their commitments to 
Iraq reconstruction.  He added that as soon as he took 
office, he asked the Consejo to see if it could be 
rescheduled but was informed the dates were fixed and it was 
too short a time frame to successfully host it. 
 
6.  Montilla underscored that Spain would continue its 
participation as a member of the Iraq Core Group, and would 
comply with the funding committed by the GOS during the Iraq 
Donor\'s Conference. 
 
7.  Montilla could respond only in general terms to questions 
regarding Spain\'s views on Doha Round negotiations. He said 
Spain would continue to favor trade liberalization in the 
multilateral arena consistent with the EU position. 
 
8.  The Ambassador outlined the many efforts the Embassy has 
launched to promote bilateral business cooperation.  The 
minister acknowledged the importance of these efforts and 
pledged to work together to expand trade ties.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAID, PINR, PGOV, IZ, SP 
SUBJECT: NEW SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE AID 
 
 
1. This report is sensitive but unclassified and is not for 
Internet distribution. 
 
2. (U) In an initial courtesy call on new Secretary General 
for the Spanish International Aid Agency (AECI) Juan Pablo de 
Laiglesia, de Laiglesia laid out the new Socialist 
government\'s vision for Spanish aid policy.  Top on the 
Administration\'s list is increasing aid funding from the 
current level of 0.24% of GDP.  The GOS hopes to reach 0.3% 
of GDP by 2005, 0.5% by 2008 and finally 0.7 - the EU\'s goal 
- by 2012.  AECI hopes to increase its share of total GOS aid 
from the current 17% to 25%.  While the Administration plans 
to continue Spain\'s traditional focus on the Latin American 
and Mediterranean regions, de Laiglesia told us that 
additional funding will be directed toward Africa as well as 
\"horizontal\" (cross-cutting) issues such as health and 
support for microbusinesses.  De Laiglesia also mentioned 
that AECI will support Brazilian President da Silva\'s 
anti-hunger initiative. 
 
3. (U) AECI leadership plans to restructure the agency to 
meet its new goals.  Specifically, de Laiglesia mentioned 
streamlining and professionalizing AECI staff, strengthening 
offices working on horizontal issues, and improving the 
agency\'s ability to monitor and evaluate projects.  He also 
referred to two objectives laid out by the new State 
Secretary for Cooperation, Leire Pajin - to integrate aid 
 
SIPDIS 
policy into traditional foreign policy priorities (Note: the 
Zapatero government changed the MFA\'s name to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Cooperation) and to reduce tied aid. 
 
IRAQ 
 
4. (U) EconCouns told de Laiglesia we were pleased to see 
that the new Administration has promised to carry through on 
the pledge Spain made at last October\'s Iraq Donors\' 
Conference.  De Laiglesia confirmed that is the case, but 
added that factors on the ground in Iraq will determine how 
much funding can actually be disbursed in the short-term.  He 
specifically mentioned the need for a \"sovereign government\" 
to which concessional credits for reconstruction can be 
issued and the difficult security situation that has led to 
suspension of certain AECI actions in Iraq, particularly 
around Diwaniya.  He confirmed that Spain\'s mix of assistance 
(credits, humanitarian aid, reconstruction funding, etc.) can 
be modified if on-the-ground conditions require. 
 
LATIN AMERICA 
 
5. (U) Finally, de Laiglesia confirmed AECI\'s interest in 
coordinating with USAID at both agency and mission levels on 
projects and actions in Latin America. 
 
COMMENT 
 
6. (U) Under the previous Administration, AECI and USAID\'s 
LAC bureau held periodic consultations on aid to Latin 
America.  Embassy stands ready to facilitate USAID dialogue 
with the new AECI leadership. 
 
BIO NOTE 
 
7. (SBU) De Laiglesia is a career diplomat.  He served as 
Spain\'s Ambassador to Mexico from 1995-1997 and Ambassador to 
Poland from 1997-2001.  Most recently, he was Special Envoy 
for Coastal Issues.  We anticipate he will play a significant 
role on aid issues, since the head of the AECI, Leire Pajin, 
is a career Socialist politician who has never served in 
government.

.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) We delivered reftel demarche to Inigo de Palacio, MFA 
Director of UN Affairs, on May 7.  De Palacio stated while no 
decision had yet been made, Spain may abstain on the vote to 
roll over UN Security Council Resolution 1487 this year.  He 
said that the change from voting in favor to abstaining on 
the resolution springs from GOS concerns that the rollover of 
the deferral of ICC investigations and prosecutions for UN 
peacekeepers has become seen as an automatic and blanket 
renewal, which the MFA believes may violate the Article 16 
provisions of the ICC.  De Palacio commented that even if 
Spain abstains, he believed that the rollover of the 
resolution would still garner enough yes votes to pass. 
PolCouns stressed how important it would be to have Spain on 
board on this issue and that the rollover vote should not be 
a forum to re-argue our differences regarding the ICC.  De 
Palacio said that he would present our position to the MFA, 
but that he did not expect a final decision to be made until 
the following week. 
 
2. (C) Regarding the timing of the UNSC vote, De Palacio 
stated that Spain, regardless of its vote, would support the

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SP, Counterterrorism, American - Spanish Relations 
SUBJECT: DCM\'S MEETING WITH MFA STATE SECRETARY BERNARDINO 
LEON 
 
REF: STATE 89241 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR KATHLEEN M. FITZPATRICK FOR REASONS 
1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1. (C)  DCM paid an initial call May 10 on MFA State 
Secretary Bernadino Leon, who said this was his first meeting 
 
SIPDIS 
with a foreign embassy since taking office.  Leon made a 
point of saying that the new government wanted to have 
excellent relations with the U.S., especially on 
counter-terrorism in light of March 11.  He said Spain likely 
would increase its Euro corps presence in Afghanistan and he 
expressed optimism that Spain would agree to a Provincial 
Reconstruction Team (PRT) (but said the decision was still 
pending at MOD).  DCM mentioned our desire for 500-800 more 
troops; Leon demurred on numbers, saying likely would not be 
that high, and the exact count had not yet been determined. 
 
2. (C)  Leon also said Spain was considering sending a 
Guardia Civil/police contingent to Haiti to help train the 
police and contribute to democratization there.  He said MFA 
felt that would be Spain\'s most useful contribution, rather 
than peacekeeping forces.  He also offered Spain\'s help on 
economic issues in the lead up to the US-EU summit. 
 
3. (C)  DCM noted our desire, now that we have expressed our 
disappointment on the Iraq troop withdrawal decision, to move 
forward to continue our excellent relations with Spain under 
the new government.  DCM said U.S. would welcome support in 
the EU on counter-terrorism issues such as Passenger Name 
recognition and terrorist financing.  DCM also noted that he 
thought that positive steps on Afghanistan, along the lines 
Leon foreshadowed, would likely be very well received in 
Washington. 
 
4. (C)  Noting that Iran was another area of cooperation 
between the US and Spain, with Spain chair of the IAEA board 
of governors, DCM said our experts on Iran were ready and 
willing to come to Madrid to brief the new government.  Leon 
said Zapatero specifically wanted to maintain the good ties 
that Aznar had with Khattami, saying that Spain could be 
useful in this regard. 
 
5. (C)  On Iraq/UNSC resolution, Leon reconfirmed that Spain 
was not pursuing a parallel draft with France and Germany, 
but noted Spain could be helpful with these two countries as 
discussion progressed, as well as with the Latin Americans 
now on the UNSC (Chile and Mexico). He averred that Spain 
would adopt a \"completely cooperative\" approach on this issue. 
 
6. (C)  Leon noted his personal affinity with the U.S.  He 
said his grandmother was an American citizen (from Baltimore, 
of a shipping family called Bevan, sent to Malaga on business 
and remained in Spain).  Also present at the meeting was 
Rafael Descaller who essentially will have the number three 
post at the MFA.  Descaller mentioned his very favorable 
experience as a Fullbright scholar at Stanford.  Descallar 
also mentioned Latin America as another are of common 
U.S.-Spanish interest.  Leon agreed that he and DCM should 
maintain a regular dialogue and open lines of communication. 
 
7. (C)  DCM also took the opportunity to ask about Spain\'s 
plans regarding its Embassy in Iraq after June 30 (reftel). 
Leon replied that the GOS might consider elevating the 
Spanish Charge to the rank of Ambassador.  Leon said he would 
take this under consideration. 
 
8. (C)  At the close of the meeting, Leon noted that 
difficult issues like the Couso case (the Spanish cameraman 
killed during gunfire in the Palestine Hotel incident last 
year and a major cause celebre here), would have to be dealt 
with but could wait until an appropriate time.  He reiterated 
his desire for open contacts and said he wanted to invite DCM 
to lunch in the near future. 
 
9. (C)  Comment:  Leon\'s professed desire for good relations 
with the U.S. echoes sentiments we have heard from many in 
the new government -- and also parallels the lack of specific 
details on concrete cooperation.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: SENV, TBIO, PINR, SP 
SUBJECT: NEW SPANISH ENVIRONMENT OFFICIAL ON BIOTECH AND 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
 
1. We met May 12 with the new Environment Ministry Secretary 
General for Pollution Prevention and Climate Change, Arturo 
Gonzalo Aizpiri.  Our discussions focused on two of Gonzalo\'s 
key responsibilities: biotech and climate change. 
 
Biotech 
 
2. We emphasized to Gonzalo the USG\'s interest in the 
agricultural biotech issue - one we had discussed frequently 
with his predecessors.  Gonzalo listened, but admitted that 
he is not yet read in on the issue.  We mentioned Spain\'s 
recent change of vote in the Agriculture Council on GM sweet 
corn (BT-11) approval, (Spain went from \"yes\" to abstention, 
despite technical level recommendation for a positive vote) 
and told him we were unsure if the change represented a 
change in policy or merely reflected an initially cautious 
position from a new Administration.  Gonzalo characterized 
the vote as \"provisional\" and confirmed that there is a need 
for further interministerial discussion on biotech policy. 
 
Climate Change 
 
3. Gonzalo was clearly much more up to speed on the climate 
change issue (see bio note para 7).  We asked him about two 
pending plans: the National Emissions Allocation Plan, which 
was due to the European Commission by March 31, and the 
long-delayed Spanish National Climate Change Plan. 
 
4. Regarding the National Emissions Allocation Plan, Gonzalo 
said that while the previous Administration had gathered 
copious information from affected industries, it had taken a 
\"political decision\" not to finalize the plan before the 
March 31 deadline.  The new government will build on the 
existing draft to finalize the product.  Gonzalo explained 
that under the new Administration, Second Vice President and 
Minister of Economy Solbes is in charge of implementing the 
Allocation Plan, but the Environment Ministry is responsible 
for transmitting the plan to the Commission and managing the 
process of transposing the EU emissions trading directive 
into national law.  For that reason, Gonzalo and the 
Secretary General for Energy are co-Secretaries of an 
 
SIPDIS 
interministerial climate change working group led by the 
State Secretary for Economy.  When asked about the timeline 
for completing the plan, Gonzalo referred to the October 1 
date by which the Commission needs to have approved the plan 
and the specific allocations to each company must be 
determined.  Since the Commission needs three months to 
review the plan, the GOS should ideally have it ready by July 
1.  That will be difficult, Gonzalo said, and he speculated 
that the GOS will be doing well if it finishes the plan 
sometime in July.  The GOS also intends to complete in July 
the transfer of the EU emissions trading rules into national 
legislation. 
 
5. On the National Climate Change Plan, Gonzalo clarified 
that while the National Climate Council, whose members 
represent NGOs, national, regional and local governments, 
industry associations, unions and scientists, had approved 
the previous Administration\'s draft plan in February 2004, 
the Plan was never formally adopted by the Spanish 
Ministerial Council.  The current Administration will use the 
existing draft and add elements the Socialist Party, while in 
opposition, thought were glaringly absent - specifically 
concrete actions, timetables, sources of financing and clear 
designation of responsibilities. 
 
6. While the previous Administration was clearly concerned 
that its obligation under the Kyoto Protocol to limit 
emissions increases to 15% over 1990 levels would be 
extraordinarily expensive (Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated 
19 billion Euros - $22.6 billion - between 2008-2012) and 
threaten Spanish competitiveness, the Socialist government 
has stated repeatedly its commitment to Kyoto. 
Interestingly, when asked if he thought there was a chance 
Spain could meet its emissions reduction commitment, Gonzalo 
limited himself to saying that Spain will do all that is 
\"reasonably possible\" to meet its goal.  This tracks with the 
GOS decision to put Solbes at the head of the National 
Emissions Allocation Plan discussions, indicating that the 
Socialist government will be attuned to implications for the 
Spanish economy.  Gonzalo was critical of the previous 
Administration\'s \"lackluster\" efforts to reduce energy 
consumption, saying that the 5% annual increase in energy 
demand to support a GDP growth rate of just under 3% was 
unsustainable.  The Zapatero government will act to improve 
energy efficiency, he said. 
 
Bio Note 
 
7. Gonzalo came across as professional and very willing to 
engage with us.  His proficiency in climate change and energy 
issues stems from his former position as Subdirector for 
Climate Change and Environmental Planning for Spanish oil 
company Repsol YPF.  In that position, he interacted with 
ARPEL, a Latin American energy industry association, and with 
some American industry groups dealing with the climate change 
issue.  He also previously served as director of the Madrid 
regional government\'s environmental agency and as Director 
General for Environmental Policy in the former Socialist 
government from 1993-96.

points, Charge made clear that President Zapatero, Foreign 
Minister Moratinos and other high-level officials in the

even if Spain abstained (ref B), we did not believe that was 
the case.

REF: STATE 104199 
 
Classified By: Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Political Counselor, for Reasons 1 
.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) We delivered reftel demarche on May 14 to Enrique 
Mora, Director of the MFA\'s Office of EU Foreign Policy and 
Common Security.  Mora said that the new Spanish government 
would maintain Spain\'s previous policies on the issues being 
discussed at the next EU General Affairs and External 
Relations Council meeting.  On ESDP issues, he said that the 
GOS would continue to support the idea that European defense 
policy should complement and reinforce NATO, and not become 
an alternative to NATO.  Mora said he did not see anything in 
the Headline Goal for 2010 or the Battlegroups proposal that 
was inconsistent with NATO.  He stated that the only proposal 
that may be of concern was the idea for a separate European 
tactical planning unit in Belgium. 
 
------------------ 
Western Balkans 
------------------ 
 
2. (C) Regarding Croatia, Mora said that he agreed that 
Croatia was not making sufficient progress on the issues of 
detaining Gotovina and providing for the return of refugees. 
He said that these issues would be taken up at the next EU 
meeting, in June.  As far as continued negotiations on entry 
into the EU, Mora said that the EU does consider Croatia to 
be a functioning democracy and a functioning market economy, 
which are the two criteria necessary for discussions to 
proceed.  Depending on the June discussion on how to handle 
Croatian shortcomings, Mora said he saw a high-probability 
that Croatia would be included in entry negotiations along 
with Romania and Bulgaria. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
European Neighborhood Policy and Russia 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Regarding the EU\'s periphery, Mora said that the 
European Neighborhood Policy document would not be discussed 
at this next meeting, but that it would be on the June 
agenda.  Spain\'s most notable request on this matter will be 
in requesting that Morocco and Algeria be included in the 
policy.  Mora said that the EU continues to work on getting 
the Russians to live up to their troop withdrawal commitments 
in Georgia and Moldova, but that he saw the Russians holding 
out for financial reasons. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Mora said he did not know of any new EU projects or 
funding that would be on the table at the next EU-Latin 
America and Caribbean Summit.  He added that he didn\'t 
believe that any progress could be made on EU-Mercosur 
negotiations until there was a commitment to restart the Doha 
Round discussions. 
 
-------------------- 
Cyprus and Turkey 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) On Cyprus and Turkey, Mora said that the EU had acted 
on April 29 to begin ending the isolation of the Turkish 
Cypriot community, and that the only discussions at next 
week\'s meetings would be some talks on how to certify the 
direct entry of Turkish Cypriot products into the EU.  On 
Turkey, he said that Spain also looked favorably on the 
reforms passed by the Turkish parliament.  He said that Spain 
and Italy (and to some degree, the United Kingdom) were 
supporting EU membership for Turkey, but that France and 
Germany had major reservations.  Mora said he thought that 
Germany might be swayed at some point because of its 
commercial interests in Turkey, but with the issue of German 
citizenship for residents of Turkish decent stil

request posts to submit the following questions as soon 
as possible: 
 
4.  Since January 1994, how many blank national 
passports have been reported as lost, stolen, missing, 
or otherwise unaccounted for worldwide?  If possible, 
please provide a complete list of these passport 
numbers. 
 
Number of lost blank passports since 1994 - 
approximately 1000.  We have been informed by Spanish 
authorities that lost/stolen blank passports are 
reported to the DHS (legacy INS) office in Madrid. 
 
5.  In 2003, how many lawfully issued national 
passports were reported stolen, lost, missing, or 
otherwise unaccounted for worldwide? 
 
Reported Lost/stolen or misplaced in 2003 - 14,448. 
 
6.  Is the government required to check a person\'s 
fingerprints against a database before granting 
permanent residence status? 
 
All Spanish citizens and all foreign legal residents of 
Spain are documented with identity cards linked to a 
central database with fingerprint data (right index 
finger).  This data is checked against a national and 
EU/Schengen database. 
Ministerio del Interior: Extranjera e Inmigracin 
(www.) [Spanish, English, French] This site describes 
all the paperwork needed for residency. 
All non-EU citizens wanting to stay in Spain for more 
than 30 days need a visa from the Spanish Embassy or 
Consulate closest to their place of residence outside 
of Spain. When they arrive in Spain, they must apply 
for residency. Getting residency in Spain allows you to 
live anywhere in the EC. Likewise, getting residency 
somewhere else in the EC gives you a right to residency 
in Spain. 
The various visas you can obtain are described in these 
Spanish Consulate of New York links: Student Visas; 
Tourist and Business Visas; and Residence Visas.  The 
e 
Spanish Consulate in New York lists the requirements 
for each of the six types of residence visas/work 
permits. 
      If you\'re married or related to a Spanish citizen, 
     you apply for the Visa de Reagrupacion Familiar (Family 
     Unification). 
    If you\'re retired, you apply for the Visa de 
Jubilados (Retiree). Note: on arrival in Spain, you may 
be asked to prove you have medical insurance. 
    If you\'re wealthy, apply for visas #4 or #5. 
    If you\'re a Mormon, apply for visa #6. 
After arriving with the residence visa in their 
passports, non-EU citizens have three months after 
arrival in Spain to go to the nearest Oficina de 
Extranjeros (Foreigners Office). Below are the 
following documents generally required. 
      Form called Solicitud de Tarjeta en Regimen 
     Comunitario 
    Passport and 2 photocopies 
    3 passport-sized photos 
    Medical certificate 
    If a member of the family is Spanish (or has 
residency): your Libro de Familia (Family Book), DNI 
ok), DNI 
(National Identity Card or Legal Residency Card) of 
that family member, Empadronamiento, and medical 
insurance. 
    If you will be working for someone: a contract of 
employment. 
    If you will be self-employed: documents that prove 
you fulfill the requirements necessary to undertake 
that activity. 
    If you won\'t be working: documents that prove you 
have enough money to live during your time in Spain, 
plus medical insurance. 
    If you will be a student: proof of matriculation 
in an accredited school, plus the requirements of the 
previous item. 
The Resident Card is issued after adjudication of the 
application. Each Oficina de Extranjeros (Foreigners 
Office) processes candidates locally and the time spent 
both waiting in line at the office and waiting for your 
Resident Card can vary tremendously, depending on where 
you do it. Your photo and fingerprint will be taken and 
maintained in a central database held by the Spanish 
National Police (SNP), a sub-section of the Ministry of 
 of 
Interior (MOI). 
ID Numbers in Spain 
NIE (Nmero de Identidad de Extranjero - Alien ID 
number): The immigration service (SNP) issues this 
number upon obtaining residency (the number is on the 
Resident Card). This is the identification number in 
Spain. It is needed in order to file taxes, establish a 
business, open a bank account, and for almost all other 
forms. Both EU citizens and non-EU citizens get issued 
a NIE. 
      DNI (Documento Nacional de Identidad): This is the 
     ID number for Spanish citizens. The same number is used 
     for one\'s driver\'s license and it linked to the \"Family 
     Book\" (Libro de la Familia), which lists births, deaths 
     and marriages. 
    NIF (Nmero de Identificacin Fiscal): This is the 
tax ID number for all individuals. For Spaniards, it\'s 
the DNI plus one letter; for foreigners, it\'s the same 
number as your NIE. With a NIE, there is no need to re- 
apply for a NIF. If you\'re a nonresident who has to pay 
taxes in Spain, a NIF is issued without having a NIE. 
NIE. 
    CIF (Certificado de Identificacin Fiscal): This 
is the same as the NIF, but for companies. 
    Social Security Number: The employer applies for 
this number when you start your first job in Spain. 
This number then stays with you for all subsequent 
jobs. If you are self-employed, you apply yourself for 
this number. 
 4.   Is the government required to check a person\'s 
fingerprints against a database before granting 
naturalization? 
 
All legal residents of Spain are documented with 
fingerprint data prior to being eligible to apply for 
naturalization. Among the documents to be presented are 
certificates of prior criminal records or absence of 
these from all countries of prior residence including 
Spain.  Police Security checks are mandatory before 
granting Spanish nationality. 
 
5.  Please provide information, including if 
practicable a copy of pertinent laws, that describe all 
the circumstances (and qualifications) in which a 
person might naturalize and/or obtain citizenship in 
in 
the country.  Have any nationality and citizenship laws 
changed since the country was admitted to VWP, 
particularly those that relate to the circumstances in 
which people born outside the country may acquire or 
may have acquired citizenship in the country? 
 
Spanish nationality law was amended on October 8, 2002 
by Law 36/2002, modifying the civil code on nationality 
issues. 
 
The law provided benefits to recover nationality for 
those who had lost it and to facilitate access to 
Spanish nationality for relatives of Spanish citizens, 
expanding the acquisition through family relationships 
to include grandchildren of Spanish citizens born 
outside of Spain.  Reciprocity with a number of South 
American countries has resulted in a number of people 
acquiring Spanish nationality while still being able to 
retain their other nationality. 
 
Legislation being pouched (Appendix F) and available on- 
line at: 
http://www.justicia.es/servlet/Satellite?cit= 10582103524 
3&pagename=Portal_del_ciudad 
 
6.  Provide the number of applications for 
naturalization approved, denied and pending, each year 
since 2001, breaking down the denials by grounds for 
denial and the number denied under each ground. 
(Examples of grounds could include, but are not limited 
to, failure to meet host country\'s residency or 
language requirements, terrorism, various law 
enforcement concerns, etc.). 
 
Unknown - Cons has requested the information from MFA 
and from Spanish National Police Documents Unit. 
 
7.  Under what circumstances may a passport be revoked? 
Can convicted felons obtain passports?  If so, are the 
passports annotated in a way that would indicate that 
the bearer has a criminal conviction? 
 
Art. 25 of the Spanish civil code establishes the 
following grounds to lose Spanish nationality by 
naturalized citizens: 
  a.   Those who, for a period exceeding three years, 
     exclusively use the nationality renounced when 
     acquiring the Spanish nationality. 
b.   Those who voluntarily joined the armed services or 
assume a political position in a foreign country 
against the specific prohibition of the Spanish 
government. 
c.   Those who are convicted of forgery, omission or 
fraud in the acquisition of the Spanish nationality 
will have their acquisition of Spanish nationality 
nullified, although this will not affect bonafide third 
parties.   The Prosecutor must initiate the revocation 
process within 15 years. 
 
Citizenship retention of expatriate Spaniards requires 
maintaining registration with the Spanish Embassy or 
Consulate in the country of residence. 
 
8.  Please list the names of major organized crime 
groups operating in the country. 
 
Organized crime groups from many countries have 
footholds in Spain.  For example, English, Russian, 
Ukrainian, Israeli, Italian Mafia, and Colombian crime 
groups are known to have members living in Spain. 
These groups do not always have clearly defined names 
but include:  East Europeans (Slavic and Romanians); 
Chinese (mostly PRC, as opposed to Taiwanese); North 
Africans (Moroccans and Tunisians; some Algerians); 
South Americans (Ecuadorians and Colombians); Sub- 
Saharan Africans (primarily West Africans, e.g., 
Nigeria and Ghana); Cubans (less than in past years; 
mostly but not exclusively surrounding the Canaries). 
We\'ve also heard that there are some areas that have 
been heavily infiltrated by Russian / Former Soviet 
Union organized crime groups. 
 
9.  If available, please provide a brochure or pamphlet 
describing each type of national passport that remains 
valid for travel. 
 
Brochures not available.  We have produced a summary of 
information regarding documents provided to the DHS 
forensic document lab and to the Department of State 
Office of Fraud Prevention at CA/FPP. This information 
is being pouched (Appendix B) and provided via email to 
CA/VO. 
 
10.  If available, please provide a copy of the 
country\'s most recent annual Uniform Crime Report.  If 
your country does not produce a Uniform Crime Report or 
something similar, or if the following information is 
not included in the report, please ask the country to 
provide:  the number of people convicted of a crime 
currently in prison; the number of those in prison who 
are nationals of the host country; the rules that apply 
to foreigners convicted of a crime being deported in 
lieu of serving sentences; the numbers of foreigners 
convicted of a crime deported since 2001 in lieu of 
serving a sentence;  the degree of centralization of 
the country\'s law enforcement records if the country 
has a federal system, and the extent that lack of such 
centralization could affect these requested statistics. 
 
RSO produced memo regarding Crime and Spain also being 
pouched (Appendix C). Copy of RSO cable (03 State 
003091):  Analysis and Trends of Crime in Spain, is 
being pouched (Appendix D). 
 
Uniform Crime Report not available, but a hard copy of 
a report from the Ministry of Interior is functionally 
similar.  Hard copy is being pouched (Appendix E), and 
it is available on the Internet at 
http://www.mir.es/oris/index.htm 
 
11.  The IWG will be formulating assessments of the 
level of law enforcement cooperation between the host 
government and the U.S. and the level of law 
enforcement within the country; any information or 
assessment the Embassy can provide at this time on 
either will be useful. 
 
The Consular Section is directly involved in all formal 
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty Requests (MLAT) and 
Extradition requests made by the US to Spain.  The 
Spanish requests to the US are handled by the Spanish 
Embassy in Washington, which presents them to the 
Department of State and Department of Justice.  In FY 
2002, the Embassy handled 183 MLAT requests and 43 
extradition requests.  In FY 2003, the Embassy handled 
165 MLAT requests and 50 extradition requests.  Many of 
these requests involved requests for sharing of 
information regarding major crime, drug, fraud, and 
terrorist investigations.  Both countries are 
interested in sharing information and there is active 
judicial cooperation between Spain and the US.  Some 
information requested cannot be provided due to 
national security issues or due to the format of 
information or specificity of the request itself. A 
very few extradition requests have not been honored due 
to sentencing guidelines and restrictions intrinsic in 
the treaties and national laws. 
 
 12.  Please provide a copy of the law or regulation, 
if any, which authorizes the country\'s Government to 
provide the USG with a certified copy of a criminal 
judgment and/or criminal history record of a national 
of the country.  Assume that the information would be 
used in an official immigration investigation (a non- 
criminal investigation to determine whether a non-U.S. 
citizen should be prevented from entering the United 
States or deported from the United States).  Assume 
also that this request would be made through INTERPOL 
channels rather than through a formal Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request.  (Consular sections 
may have this in relation to judicial requests for 
assistance.) 
 
Copy of the Legislation regarding international 
cooperation in law enforcement matters is being pouched 
(Appendix F). 
 
It is available on the Internet at 
http://www.igsap.map.es/cia/dispo/25726.htm 
 
13.  The information below is requested in order to 
assist in evaluating U.S. law enforcement and security 
interests in VWP countries, as required by Visa Waiver 
Program legislation. The information is needed in order 
to assist the Department of Justice in obtaining a 
complete picture of law enforcement procedures in the 
VWP countries and how those procedures might affect 
joint investigations and other law enforcement 
cooperation. 
 
13a.Provide a summary of how the country\'s police may 
use informants, including any restrictions or 
prohibitions on use of informants.  If practical, 
provide a copy of pertinent statute, case law, or 
regulation. 
 
   Use of informants is similar to that in the US. 
Legislation relating to that is included in Appendix F 
or available on the Internet at 
http://www.igsap.map.es/cia/dispo/25726.htm 
 
13b.Provide a summary of legislation and regulations 
regarding the types of investigative techniques the 
country\'s police can use in conducting undercover 
investigations including any restrictions on such 
activities, such as restrictions on the use of 
subterfuge or on how police officers may represent 
themselves to the targets.  If practical, provide a 
copy of pertinent statute, case law, or regulation.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/07/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, EK, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN: DISAPPOINTED BUT STILL ENGAGED AFTER 
EQUATORIAL GUINEA ELECTIONS 
 
 
Classified By: KATHLEEN FITZPATRICK, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. 
REASON 1.4 (B) & (D) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Spanish MFA officials were upset that Equatorial 
Guinean President Obiang allowed the opposition Convergence 
for Social Democracy Party (CPDS) to pick up only a handful 
of seats in the April 25 legislative elections.  Citing 
serious voting irregularities, Spanish officials concluded 
that the results showed that Obiang simply refuses to share 
power and is resistant to Spanish pressure.  However, Spain 
will continue to engage Equatorial Guinea (GREG) on 
governance issues.  The GOS continues to monitor opposition 
leader Severo Moto although they no longer consider him a 
major political player.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
Spain\'s Pre-election Hopes 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Poloff consulted with Jose Luis Martin-Yague, desk 
officer for sub-Saharan Africa, on May 19 to discuss Spanish 
views on Equatorial Guinea\'s April 25 legislative elections 
and the status of opposition figure Severo Moto.  This was 
the first opportunity to exchange views with the MFA on these 
issues because our interlocutors were awaiting the 
installation of Alvaro IRANZO Gutierrez as the new director 
general for sub-Saharan African affairs before the GOS 
clarified its position. 
 
3. (C) Martin-Yague said Spanish officials pressed Equatorial 
Guinean President Teodorino Obiang Nguema on the need for 
fair legislative elections and a pluralist election outcome. 
Obiang rejected Spain\'s offer to ask for EU election 
monitors.  He did agree to have four Spanish election 
observers, including one senator from the governing Spanish 
Socialist Worker\'s Party (PSOE), Juan Jose La Borda.  In 
April, before the elections, Secretary of State for External 
Affairs Bernadino Leon met with Obiang in Pretoria on the 
margins of the Mbeki inauguration.  Leon discussed the need 
for transparent elections with Obiang and maintained regular 
contact with Obiang\'s chief assistant, Alejandro Ebuna, on 
the issue. 
 
4. (C) Spain had expected the opposition Convergence for 
Social Democracy Party (CPDS) would win at least twenty-five 
percent of the parliament seats.  According to Martin-Yague, 
the CPDS remains the only credible opposition party despite 
being sideline by Obiang in previous elections.  As a social 
democratic party, the CPDS maintains broad support within the 
PSOE. 
 
--------------------- 
The Election Fall-out 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) Martin-Yague told us that Spain election observers 
believe that Obiang\'s Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea 
(PDGE) party won the majority of the votes.  However, they 
found the election process to be seriously flawed.  The 
Spanish observers cited discrepancies in candidate lists and 
voter registration.  Observers also noted low voter 
participation on the island of Bioka where the CPDS claimed 
to have most of its support. 
 
6. (C) According to Martin-Yague, the CPDS defeat implies 
that months of dialogue with Obiang had failed.  Although 
Secretary Leon was \"disgusted\" with the results, Spain would 
 
SIPDIS 
remain engaged with the CPDS to help negotiate its 
parliamentary seats with the GREG.  Martin-Yague said a deal 
between the CPDS and the GREG was unlikely, however.  He 
thought Obiang wanted to keep CPDS out of power not so much 
because the CPDS was perceived as too close to Spain, but 
because Obiang believes that sharing power is losing all 
power. 
 
7. (C) Martin-Yague said that Spain has a genuine interest in 
helping Equatorial Guinea develop democracy.  Spain will 
continue to fund a program to train judicial officials, 
professionalize the civil service, and promote education and 
health programs.  Martin-Yague noted that Spain\'s interest in 
democracy is complemented by Spain\'s interest in Mange 
Island.  Spain also supports Equatorial Guinea\'s claim to the 
island and would possibly like to pursue joint exploration of 
its oil reserves in the future.

8. (C) Opposition leaders Severo Moto remains a political 
refugee in Spain, but his Progress Party (PP) has little 
support in Malabo or among immigrants from Equatorial Guinea 
in Spain.  Although Moto continues to denounce human rights 
abuses by the Obiang regime, his exile in Spain has 
diminished his influence on politics in Equatorial Guinea, 
said Martin-Yague.  Nevertheless, the GOS continues to 
monitor Moto to determine whether he is liability on Spain\'s 
relationship with the GREG, Martin-Yague said.

Comment

9. (C) Spain is disappointed that its advocacy of free 
elections with Obiang failed to help the CPDS in the April 25 
legislative election.  There is heightened interested in the 
CPDS in Spain because the party shares the political 
philosophy of the governing Spanish socialist party.  The 
CPDS loss sent a signal that Spain has little leverage over 
Obiang.  Nevertheless, Spain will continue to push the GREG 
on governance issues.

SUBJECT: SPAIN: MFA OFFICIAL SEES NO CHANGE IN CUBA POLICY 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick, reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Poloff met May 18 with Pablo Gomez de Olea, 
the MFA\'s deputy director general for Mexico, Central America 
and the Caribbean.  Gomez assured us the Zapatero government 
will maintain a tough stance on Cuba and will not 
unilaterally backtrack on the EU\'s strict common position on 
Cuba.  In Gomez de Olea\'s opinion, although a minority of the 
Socialist Party (PSOE) would like to see President Rodriguez 
Zapatero soften Spain\'s position on Cuba and open some kind 
of dialog with Fidel Castro, the majority of Socialists do 
not believe progress is possible with Castro and back the 
tough line Spain has taken consistent with the EU.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (C) With Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Angel 
Moratinos\' recent meeting with his Mexican counterpart Derbez 
as a backdrop, poloff met May 18 with Gomez de Olea to \"take 
the MFA\'s temperature\" on the outlook for GOS relations with 
Cuba under the Zapatero administration.  Moratinos had 
commented after his discussions with Derbez that Spain wanted 
to take a \"calm\" approach to Cuba.  Gomez de Olea emphasized 
that in his opinion there will be no change in Spain\'s policy 
toward Cuba under the Zapatero government.  \"The minister may 
have used some unfortunate verbiage,\" he said, \"but the fact 
is, even if Zapatero wanted to soften Spain\'s tough stance it 
would be very difficult to do it because the EU common 
position on Cuba is very strict, and Zapatero is very much in 
favor of following the EU position on this and other issues. 
 
3.  (C) Gomez de Olea acknowledged there are those in PSOE 
who would like to see Zapatero renew some kind of dialog with 
Castro (the far left-leaning Socialists) but the majority of 
PSOE officials understand dialog with Castro has produced no 
progress in the past and will not produce more in the future. 
 Although Zapatero is not likely to deliver the same degree 
of vitriol to Castro in his public statements as Aznar did, 
the Zapatero government will act consistently with the EU, 
demanding the release of dissident prisoners and the 
beginning of democratic changes on the island. 
 
4.  (C) Finally Gomez de Olea remarked that the substantial 
economic interests Spanish companies have on the island will 
not pressure the Zapatero government to moderate Spain\'s 
position on Cuba.  For some time, Castro himself has seen the 
wisdom of separating the two, understanding that he will only 
cause himself economic pain if he makes life difficult for 
Spanish businesses.

SUBJECT: SPAIN:  READOUT ON US-EU OPEN SKIES NEGOTIATIONS 
 
REF: A. STATE 91041 
 
     B. 03 MADRID 4336 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  We spoke May 18 with Deputy Director for Air 
Transportation Development Eugenia Llorens, who participated 
in the latest round of US-EU open skies negotiations, about 
matters contained in Reftel A and her views on the possible 
outcome of the negotiations and its implications for Spain. 
Llorens was uncertain whether this round of negotiations 
would be successful, but awaits information on an anticipated 
USG revised proposal.  She does not consider the US-Ireland 
negotiations to involve open skies issues, and therefore does 
not view them as a \"green light\" from Brussels to negotiate 
bilaterally.  She understands the importance to Spanish 
carriers of achieving an open skies agreement, but does not 
yet know whether the new Socialist government will be 
receptive to negotiating a bilateral agreement if an early 
harvest US-EU agreement cannot be reached by the June US-EU 
Summit.  She will soon brief the new Director General of 
Civil Aviation regarding these issues.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  We shared ref A talking points with Llorens who demurred 
until consulting with her new political leadership.  When 
asked for her views on the latest round of US-EU open skies 
negotiations, Llorens said that the \"big uncertainty\" is 
market access in the US.  Llorens seemed doubtful that the 
anticipated new US proposal will meet EU demands for greater 
access and be accepted by member states.  She also lamented 
the delays that would result in failure to achieve an early 
harvest as some of the negotiators will be changing in the 
fall. 
 
3.  Llorens does not yet know what stance the newly-elected 
Socialist GOS will take on bilateral negotiations should the 
goal of a US-EU early harvest fail, noting that Manuel 
Bautista Perez, the new Director General for Civil Aviation, 
just took office last week and has not yet been briefed on 
these matters.  She acknowledged that the GOS must clarify 
its position on this matter, mentioning that Spanish airlines 
are still exposed to potential antitrust action for lack of 
an open skies agreement. 
 
4.  Llorens acknowledged Ireland\'s current discussions with 
the US, but does not view the US-Ireland discussions to be 
true open skies bilateral negotiations.  She described the 
subject matter as a \"very localistic issue\" pertaining to the 
percentage of trans-Atlantic flights that must stop in 
Shannon rather than fly direct from the US to Dublin over the 
next few years.  She stated that the terms lack any antitrust 
component, implying that Ireland,s negotiations do not 
signal EC approval for new bilateral open skies negotiations 
between member states and the US, as we previously proposed 
to her (see Reftel B). 
 
5.  COMMENT:  Like the government it replaced, Spain\'s new 
government could continue wrestling with the 
mutually-exclusive desire to protect domestic commercial 
interests through a bilateral open skies agreement versus 
following the lead from Brussels and awaiting an eventual 
US-EU agreement.  The previous GOS generally did not oppose 
the instructions of Spanish EU Commissioner for Transport and 
Energy Loyola de Palacio regarding civil air matters.  This 
led to Spain\'s reluctance to pursue Iberia\'s desire for an 
agreement.  The new Socialist government may be more open 
than the last to move against de Palacio or her successor. 
Still, with its announced plans to be closer to Europe than 
the past administration, it remains to be seen under what 
conditions the new GOS would enter into bilateral open skies 
discussions with the US.  Llorens promised that the Embassy\'s 
request to meet with Director General Bautista will be 
granted prior to the June Transport Council meeting.  END 
COMMENT.

2.  Embassy received a dip note from the Spanish Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Cooperation requesting USG support and 
affirmative vote for the GOS\'s reelection as member of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council, 
Group II.  The vote will take place during ICAO\'s meetings 
in Montreal from September 28 through October 8. 
 
3.  An informal translation of the pertinent language of the 
dip note follows: 
 
Begin Informal Translation 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation presents its 
compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America 
in Madrid and has the honor to communicate that Spain is 
going to stand for the re-election as member of the ICAO 
Council, Group II, at the elections that will be during the 
35th Session of the Assembly of this organization to be held 
in Montreal from 28 September to 8 October 2004. 
 
Spain has belonged to the ICAO Council uninterruptedly since 
1951, having taken an active part in different Committees 
and Working Groups of the Organization, especially in 
operational safety, protection of air transport, and 
development of the world system of satellite navigation 
areas. 
 
Spain\'s geographic situation, as well as other factors 
(e.g., economic and political factors), make it a country 
with special interests in transport and air navigation, and 
in the promotion of international civil aviation. 
 
In 2003, the movement of airships and passengers in Spain\'s 
41 airports open for public use registered an increase of 
6.49% and 7.43% respectively, totaling more than 151 million 
of passengers and more than 1.5 million airship movements. 
Of the 41 mentioned airports, seven of them registered more 
than 8 million passengers; Madrid airport (35.4 million), 
Barcelona (22.5 million), and Palma de Mallorca (19.1 
million). 
 
Spain wishes to continue paying special attention to 
cooperative programs in the next triennium with developing 
countries, finalizing new agreements of technical 
cooperation with different countries, in harmony with the 
goals and principles that the ICAO promotes. 
 
For all the above reasons, Spain would appreciate the 
valuable support of the United States in its re-election as 
member of the ICAO Council. 
 
End translation.

SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTATION OF EU TRACEABILITY AND LABELING 
REGULATIONS IN SPAIN 
 
REF: STATE 93453 
 
1. In response to reftel request for information on 
implementation and enforcement of the new EU Traceability and 
Labeling (T&L) for food and feed regulations, we talked to 
the Spanish Food Safety Agency, the Spanish Food and Beverage 
Federation and the Spanish Feed Compounders Association 
regarding Spain\'s experience. 
 
Government View: The Spanish Food Safety Agency 
 
2. We spoke with Jose Ignacio Arranz Recio, number two in the 
Spanish Food Safety Agency (AESA), an autonomous agency 
attached to the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs. 
Arranz explained the GOS plan for implementing the new T&L 
regulations.  The players involved are the AESA, which 
provides overall direction, the autonomous communities 
(regional governments), which are responsible for oversight 
and testing in their territories (e.g., screening products on 
supermarket shelves), the Ministry of Health\'s External 
Health Service, which screens products at the port of entry 
into Spain, the Ministry of Health\'s National Consumer 
Affairs Institute, which oversees labeling compliance, and 
the Ministry of Agriculture\'s Directorate General for 
Livestock, which oversees implementation of the regulations 
on feed. 
 
3. AESA has drawn up a list of food products subject to 
screening, which include various soy, flour and corn-based 
products.  The products screened and number of samples taken 
will vary from region to region.  Samples will be tested by 
public and private laboratories deemed capable of using the 
AESA-recommended methods for detecting proteins and DNA 
(methods include ELISA, PCR, and RT-PCR).  AESA is a member 
of the European Network of Genetically Modified Organisms\' 
Laboratories (ENGL), and AESA in turn is creating a national 
network of approved labs.  If a region does not have an 
approved lab, samples can be sent to the AESA or to one of 
the approved labs in another region.  AESA will review the 
efficacy of the system every three months through December 
2004 and make recommendations to improve system deficiencies. 
 
4. Regarding sanctions, Arranz explained that when the 
problem is false or misleading information provided in 
labeling, the GOS will refer to the labeling regulations.  If 
the problem detected is introduction of a variety not 
authorized by the EU, the GOS will apply sanctions spelled 
out in existing national public health regulations.  Arranz 
said that the GOS is not coordinating enforcement issues with 
other EU member states. 
 
5. The AESA developed with the Spanish Food and Beverage 
Federation and the Ministry of Agriculture a guide for 
businesses, regional governments and consumers spelling out 
the T&L regulations and listing the varieties currently 
authorized by the EU as well as those pending authorization. 
Arranz confirmed that the AESA is the point of contact for 
private sector inquiries regarding implementation or 
enforcement of T&L regulations in Spain (website is 
www.msc.es/aesa). 
 
6. When asked about transposition of new T&L regulations into 
national law, Arranz said that EU regulations are applied 
directly in EU member states. 
 
Food Industry View: The Spanish Food and Beverage Federation 
 
7. Spanish Food and Beverage Federation (FIAB) Food Law 
Director Pilar Velazquez reported that most of FIAB\'s members 
have reformulated products to avoid labeling.  In fact, she 
is aware of no companies that are labeling, either for the 
domestic or third country markets.  Velazquez confirmed that 
FIAB worked closely with the AESA and the Ministry of 
Agriculture to develop its informational handbook on T&L 
regulations and said that FIAB\'s members are generally 
concerned about complying with the norms.  She expects that 
once the testing carried out by the Spanish national and 
regional governments, as well as that done by \"activist\" 
groups, starts to reveal results, producers will discover 
that, although they did not know it, some of their product 
inputs have GMO content. 
 
8. Velazquez characterized the Spanish government as 
\"unenthusiastic\" about the T&L regulations, but expected that 
the GOS will implement and enforce them \"properly\" to avoid 
criticism from consumer and environmental groups.  Velazquez 
confirmed our understanding that Spanish consumers are not 
overly concerned about biotech issues, and thought that after 
a year or two of T&L implementation, industry may feel more 
comfortable with sourcing cheaper GMO inputs and labeling 
their final products. 
 
Feed Industry View: The Spanish Feed Compounders Association 
 
9. Jorge Saja, the head of the Spanish Feed Compounders 
Association, told us his organization produced pamphlets for 
its members containing guidance on how to comply with the new 
T&L regulations.  He reported that the Association\'s members 
have not reformulated their products, and are successfully 
labeling where there is GMO content.  Saja explained that in 
the case of products produced during the 2003 market year, 
feed compounders are labeling where there is any uncertainty 
at all over the potential biotech content of inputs.  For 
market year 2004, feed factories are getting detailed 
information on all inputs, and will label where there is 
verified GMO content.

1. SUMMARY:  In our first meeting with new Secretary of State 
for Tourism and Trade Pedro Mejia Gomez, he told us that 
Spain fully supported EU Trade Commissioner Lamy\'s efforts to 
move forward Doha negotiations and was not overly concerned 
about potential loss of agriculture subsidies, as long as 
there was reciprocity.  The GOS is disappointed that 
investment is not the EU\'s choice for priority Singapore 
Issue, but will not fall on its sword over it.  Mejia 
expressed relief that Spain was not included on the Special 
301 Watchlist and stressed his interest in working with the 
USG on intellectual property issues.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. On May 12 DCM, Economic Counselor and Econoff met with 
Secretary of State for Tourism and Trade Pedro Mejia Gomez. 
 
SIPDIS 
Mejia was accompanied by new DG for Trade and Investment 
Oscar Via Ozalla and Nicholas Lopez Lopez, Deputy Director 
for Trade and 133 Committee titulaire. While Mejia only 
recently took possession of his office, he has significant 
experience as a trade functionary in previous administrations 
(see reftel A for biographic info).Mejia said the Spanish 
strongly supported the Fischler-Lamy letter which pushed for 
movement forward on Doha Round negotiations via reduction of 
agricultural subsidies.  He noted, however, there would be no 
support for the move unless it was met with reciprocity from 
what Mejia termed as \"traditional protectionists\" including 
the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia.  He 
acknowledged that Spanish farmers were not happy at the 
prospects of receiving fewer subsidies, but Mejia pointed out 
that changes in EU export subsidies schemes would not 
necessarily have a large impact on Spain.  He estimated the 
effect on Spain would be \"medium to low.\" 
 
3. Mejia conceded that in the interest of making progress in 
overall Doha negotiations it made sense to focus on only one 
Singapore Issue.  He said he agreed with Trade Commissioner 
Lamy that trade facilitation was important, especially for 
developing countries.  That said, the GOS continues to be 
interested in all four of the Singapore Issues, especially 
investment.  Mejia said that with such a high level of 
Spanish investments in Latin America, it would be ideal to 
make progress in eliminating barriers and restrictions 
through a multilateral investment agreement.  Spain knows 
there is little support at present for this. 
 
4. We took the opportunity of the meeting to highlight U.S. 
concerns on issues such as biotech and REACH chemicals policy 
since in the past we found that the Ministry of Industry 
(formerly the Ministry of Economy) preferred to let other 
ministries run with these issues despite clear trade 
implications.  Mejia admitted to not being familiar with the 
issues, so Lopez quickly briefed on the GOS position on 
biotech saying that Spain has almost always voted in favor. 
He claimed that the sudden change to abstentions in two 
recent votes did not signify that the new administration was 
changing direction.  He claimed the GOS remained open on 
biotech.  (NOTE: Based on our conversations with officials in 
other ministries and in the industry, we are not so sanguine. 
 See reftel C.)  We and Lopez also briefed on REACH.  We 
subsequently sent Mejia the latest REACH demarche points for 
his information. 
 
5. Even though Mejia had been present at the Ambassador\'s 
recent courtesy call on Minister of Industry, Tourism and 
Trade Montilla (reftel B), we reiterated our points on U.S. 
concerns about protection of intellectual property rights in 
Spain.  Mejia had obviously been briefed on this issue and 
expressed relief that Spain had not been named to the Special 
301 Watchlist despite the high levels of piracy.  He 
underscored Spanish commitment to combating piracy.  He told 
us that in the past 18 months enforcement officials have made 
enormous progress in their crack down on street sales of 
pirated goods.  Mejia admitted that the GOS has responded not 
only to U.S. government and industry pressure, but to demands 
from the Spanish music industry which has also been greatly 
effected.  He emphasized GOS interest in cooperating with the 
USG to make further progress in the fight against piracy. 
 
6. Mejia asked for the latest information on progress on the 
Hill to move forward legislation to repeal Foreign Sales 
Corporation.  He termed Senate passage of a draft law to be 
\"a significant step forward.\" 
 
7. COMMENT: Mejia appears to be knowledgeable and reasonable. 
 Contacts tell us he has the support and respect of trade 
bureaucrats working for him, something his predecessor did 
not enjoy.  Under his management it looks likely that Spain\'s 
trade leanings will not stray far from the previous 
administration\'s.

photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. 
In the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: KIPR, ETRD, ECON, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN IPR: ABERRANT MOD CHIP RULING 
 
REF: A. URBAN-YOUTH EMAILS 
     B. MADRID 639 
 
1. According to an April 2004 ruling made by Barcelona Penal 
Court 3, the installation of mod chips (devices that allow 
customers to alter their video game consoles so they can 
operate games downloaded from the internet or from other 
regions) is legal.  The Guardia Civil had investigated the 
practice and filed the suit against the Barcelona games 
shops, Innovagames.  The case was weak as the Guardia Civil 
did not have any evidence of mod chip installation and was 
only able to find two mod chips after combing the premises. 
 
2. The judge ruled in favor of Innovagames, basing his 
decision on what he views as a loophole in Spanish 
Intellectual Property laws.  Article 270 of the Spanish Penal 
Code prohibits the \"manufacture, distribution or possession 
of means to crack computer program security codes,\" but makes 
no reference to what the ruling refers to as \"electronic 
instruments destined to copy video and sound software.\" 
While the case has been cause for alarm in some circles and 
celebration in others, the victory for pirates will be 
short-lived.  Spain\'s amended Penal Code enters into force on 
October 1, 2004 and much more clearly defines IP protection, 
specifically extending protection to audio, visual and 
audiovisual instruments. 
 
3. The Guardia Civil does not appeal court decisions, and the 
IP industry associations who would normally become involved 
have decided to keep a low profile to reduce the \"buzz\" on 
the decision.  They acknowledge the case is so weak that it 
is extremely unlikely they would get a favorable decision on 
appeal. 
 
4. In addition, the decision is at odds with the rulings on 
four similar cases in Spain that found the use of mod chips 
clearly violates the intellectual property rights of video 
game console and program manufacturers.  In 2001, in the 
first Spanish court case against mod chips, a Madrid court 
ruled that mod-chips are illegal because they permit use of 
illegal copies.  In October 2002 a Barcelona court found that 
possession of mod chips is a punishable offense because they 
are a \"mechanism to neutralize protection measures in 
software.\"  A Leon court concluded in November 2003 that the 
distribution and installation of mod chips are IP crimes.  In 
February 2004, a Logrono court differentiated between mod 
chip installation and possession.  It found the former to be 
a crime, but not the latter. 
 
5. In a recent press release, the International Intellectual 
Property Alliance (IIPA) condemned the 2004 Barcelona court 
ruling, saying that it was \"damaging.\"  While we agree the 
court decision is of concern, we do not consider it 
representative of the view in Spain.  Our contacts at the 
Ministry of Culture\'s Copyright Office had not been aware of 
the ruling until we brought the IIPA release to their 
attention.  They do not see the decision as significant or 
trendsetting.  They have been working with the new Minister 
of Culture to prepare the transposition of the European 
Copyright Directive into Spanish law (details to be reported 
septel).  Since the Directive requires EC member states to 
provide \"adequate legal protection against circumvention of 
any effective technological measures,\" Spanish transposition 
of the Directive may also help clarify the legal status of 
mod chips.  We plan to track the transposition of the 
directive closely.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SP, NATO, American - Spanish Relations 
SUBJECT: MEETING WITH MFA\'S DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR EUROPE AND 
NORTH AMERICA 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick for reasons 
1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (C)  PolCouns and poloff paid an initial call May 17 with 
the MFA\'s newly-named Director General for Europe and North 
America, former Spanish Ambassador to Denmark and Lithuania 
Josep (Pepe) Pons.  Previously, the Directorate General for 
North America had been combined with the Asia portfolio, an 
area in which Spain has very few interests.  Under FM 
Moratinos, however, the MFA has reshuffled portfolios, 
combining North America with bilateral relations with Europe 
(EU issues will be handled in a different directorate). 
 
2.  (C)  Pons told us that in his view the MFA\'s 
restructuring of departments to bring Europe and North 
America together was a good move, because there are few 
issues that do not touch both Europe and the U.S.  Pons 
averred there was no contradiction in Spain\'s desire for 
excellent relations within an integrated Europe and strong 
US-Spain ties.  He noted that most of his experience during 
his thirty year career has been working in Europe or on 
European issues, but said that he would address U.S. issues 
with equal vigor.  However, he also indicated that the 
European portfolio -- including bilateral relations with some 
25 European countries -- would require frequent travel. 
 
3.  (C)  We noted to Pons that even as the USG has expressed 
disappointment with the Spanish troop withdrawals from Iraq, 
the USG looks forward to cooperating with Spain on a variety 
of issues.  We noted that we have heard across the board from 
the new government -- from highest levels to lower levels and 
in the Parliament -- that the new government desires good 
relations with the U.S.  We stressed that we looked forward 
to concrete steps to breathe life into this sentiment and to 
build our relationship.  Pons agreed that counter-terrorism, 
as well as Afghanistan are two key areas of common interest. 
He said he had been charged by Minister Moratinos to come up 
with \"visible areas of cooperation\".  Our common interests in 
Latin America, he agreed, also offered an area ripe for 
continued US-Spain cooperation.   He also noted the GOS\'s 
appreciation for the U.S.\'s strong support and assistance in 
securing the appointment of Spanish Ambassador Ruperez as 
Executive Director of the UN Counter Terrorism Committee. 
4.  (C)  On Afghanistan, we stressed to Pons the importance 
of Spain\'s response to our request for augmenting Spanish 
troop presence there (this meeting took place before receipt 
of reftel, though the Afghanistan issue has been a subject of 
continued dialogue with the new government).  We also took 
the opportunity to make clear that a Spanish vote in favor of 
the ICC UNSC rollover resolution would be one area in which 
Spain could show it still plans to cooperate with the U.S. 
Pons hedged a bit and said the GOS is taking a very close 
look at the issue, but \"certain unfortunate circumstances\" 
had arisen (a clear reference to the Iraq prisoner scandal: 
however, he is the first and only GOS interlocutor on the ICC 
rollover issue to directly and overtly connect the two 
issues) that made the issue more difficult.  Pons noted that 
Moratinos had consulted on the ICC rollover issue with EU 
counterparts.  (Note:  Before and after this meeting, the USG 
has raised this issue at higher levels, including with 
Moratinos, who has expressed Spain\'s strong desire to abstain 
on the resolution). 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  While the atmospherics of this first 
meeting with one of our primary interlocutors was pleasant, 
the impression we took away was that we will have to work on 
Pons in order to ensure he focuses appropriately on 
U.S.-Spain issues, given his broad bilateral Europe 
portfolio.  As with other new GOS interlocutors, we heard the 
message that the government wants to have good relations with 
the U.S., as the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez had 
with the U.S. under Presidents Reagan and former President 
Bush.  However, the devil remains in the details, and we will 
continue to stress our desire for concrete examples of 
cooperation.

MIDDLE EAST, ICC ROLLOVER RESOLUTION 
 
REF: A. STATE 111287 
 
     B. STATE 111359 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick for reasons 
1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
1.  (C)  MFA Political director Rafael Dezcallar told 
Polcouns in a May 20 meeting that Spain wanted to be helpful 
on Afghanistan but likely would have to determine whether 
resources would be available.  He indicated the GOS likely 
would not be able to meet all of the requests the USG has 
presented (ref a).  On the issue of augmenting troop presence 
in Western Afghanistan, he asked for details on the location 
and distance of the Forward Support Base from Kabul.  Per 
e-mail response from EUR/RPM, we were able to get this 
information back quickly to the MFA. (the FSB is in Herat, 
some 400 miles from Kabul in a relatively calm area).  Note: 
in a separate conversation later that day, President 
Zapatero\'s national security advisor Casajuana asked about 
the size/numbers required for the medical facility we had 
requested -- conversation reported septel). 
 
2.  (C)   When we reviewed our thinking on the possible 
elements of a draft Iraq UNSC resolution (ref b), Dezcallar 
asked about USG thinking on the Russian proposal for two 
conferences, one among Iraqis to endorse the new government 
and another with the participation of the international 
community.  Dezcallar also said the GOS believes any 
resolution must deal with the \"before and after\" sovereignty 
transfer issue, i.e., the resolution should support the 
pre-June 30 political arrangement but also outline the 
post-June 30 plan for transferring sovereignty and eventually 
holding elections.  He was pleased with the reference to a 
endorsing a political transition timetable, e.g., elections 
in January 2005.  On the element encouraging regional 
organization participation, Dezcallar expressed concern that 
a resolution specifically referring to a NATO role would 
appear to western- and even U.S.-oriented and suggested that 
resolution refer only in general to international and/or 
regional organizations. 
 
3.  (C)  As part of our continuing dialogue with the GOS over 
the past few weeks on the UNSC ICC rollover resolution, 
Dezcallar recalled his May 19 conversation with A/S Jones, 
saying that the issue remained a matter of principle for the 
GOS, and even last year the Aznar government, in voting in 
favor of the resolution, had made clear this was not to be an 
automatic annual expectation.  As have several senior MFA 
interlocutors over the past several days, Dezcallar said the 
GOS would play a positive role in helping to develop 
consensus on the resolution, and did not want to create 
complications for the US at a critical moment. 
 
4.  (C)  On the ICC rollover, Polcouns asked the GOS to look 
at this resolution as a practical measure to allow non-Rome 
Treaty participants -- particularly the U.S. -- to continue 
to perform the responsibilities the UN has asked us to 
undertake, rather than as the moment to debate the philosophy 
of the ICC.  He reaffirmed Spain very much preferred to 
abstain on the resolution, particularly if the USG has the 
votes to pass it. 
 
5.  (C)  We asked Dezcallar for his impressions of the 
back-to-back visits of Israeli FM Shalom and Palestinian PM 
Qorei, which took place at the same time A/S Burns had 
visited (to be reported septel).  Dezcallar said this is an 
extremely difficult moment in the Middle East, against the 
backdrop of the house demolitions and killings in Gaza.  He 
said the Israelis were particularly tough on the issue and 
that the Palestinians were very depressed and lacked hope. 
We noted our desire to see other leadership than Arafat, but 
Dezcallar said Arafat maintains huge symbolic significance 
for the Palestinians, particularly now, and that he must be 
taken into account.   Dezcallar urged positive gestures 
toward the Palestinians over the coming days.  Polcouns asked 
whether Qorei had acknowledged the need to stem terrorist 
violence from Hamas and others.  Dezcallar said he had, but 
that the overwhelming force used by Israel had given the 
Palestinians cover.  He expressed appreciation for the US 
abstention on the UNSC resolution on the Gaza demolitions 
just the day before. 
 
6.  (C)   Earlier that day, Polcouns had attended a speech by 
Qorei organized by a prominent Spanish think tank in 
association with the wall street journal.  When asked by the 
leader of the Jewish Community in Madrid about the same 
issue, Qorei responded that he renounced all forms of 
terrorism but accused the Israeli government of state 
terrorism against the Palestinians in Gaza.  He urged the 
Quartet to do their utmost to renew negotiations on the 
roadmap and stop Israeli demolitions and other incursions in 
the occupied territories.  He also denied that Camp David and 
Taba had offered anything concrete to the Palestinians, and 
said the portrayal that the Palestinians had rejected 
opportunities for a two-state solution were lies. 
 
8.  (C)  Dezcallar again expressed appreciation for the USG\'s 
strong support for the selection of Spanish Ambassador 
Ruperez to head the UN\'s counter-terrorism commission.  The 
GOS sees this as a very good sign, he said.

Zapatero\'s national security advisor Carles Casajuana May 20 
to brief him on our request for increased Spanish support for 
ISAF, urge the GOS to vote in favor of the UNSC ICC rollover 
resolution and share USG\'s initial thoughts on the UNSC Iraq

that it needed to come forward with a more robust program of

would not be able to fulfill all of our requests.  He said 
that Zapatero would not likely make any decision on this 
issue until after the June 13 European Parliamentary

for Socialist candidates and do not want to confuse public 
opinion by authorizing an increase in troops to Afghanistan

wanted to abstain on the ICC resolution, unless the USG did 
not have the votes to win (which he thinks we have).  On the

Carles Casajuana, DCM Manzanares, accompanied by PolCouns and 
Poloff, expressed appreciation for the welcome given to 
Assistant Secretary Burns earlier that week, including a 
meeting with Casajuana.  Manzanares noted that all of our 
encounters with officials from the new government in various 
ministries and at all levels have been very pleasant, and all 
officials had expressed their desire for good relations with 
the United States.  Manzanares said the USG wanted to put 
meat to the bones of this sentiment by building concrete 
examples of US-Spain support and cooperation. 
 
3.  (C)  One important area for cooperation, DCM noted, is 
Afghanistan, where the NATO Secretary General had identified 
significant needs that must be met by the NATO Summit in 
Istanbul to ensure that ISAF succeeds.  DCM reviewed each of 
the six requests for Spain, detailed in ref a, and left 
talking points as a non-paper.  DCM stressed the need for a 
decision by May 26 in order to properly prepare for the 
Istanbul summit and noted we are seeking an appointment for 
the Ambassador to present our request to Defense Minister 
Bono.  Casajuana was aware of our requests, as we had briefed 
MFA earlier in the day (septel) and he had heard from Spain\'s 
NATO channels. 
 
4.  (C)  Casajuana replied that Zapatero was aware that Spain 
needed to provide more than symbolic augmentation of Spain\'s 
presence in Afghanistan and that proposals were currently 
under consideration.  Spain wants to show it remains 
committed to the fight against terror, particularly in light 
of its Iraq pullout.  However, Zapatero, who would be the 
final decision-maker, would probably not make any decision on 
this matter until after the June 13 European Parliamentary 
elections, which the Socialist party was intent on winning 
big.  He said Zapatero believes that authorizing a 
significant increase in Spain\'s military presence in 
Afghanistan now would confuse public opinion as Spanish 
troops return from Iraq, making it appear that Spain was 
trading its pullout from Iraq for increased troop presence in 
Afghanistan. 
 
5.  (C)  Casajuana acknowledged Afghanistan was different 
from Iraq in that Spain considered it an authorized 
international operation directly related to Spain\'s own 
counter-terrorism needs.  Nonetheless, the Socialist party 
was intent on avoiding any controversy that could reduced 
their chances for a strong victory on June 13.  Casajuana 
said that the next three weeks would be difficult for all of 
us, as the Socialists essentially remained in a campaign mode 
with all of the attendant rhetoric.  DCM said he hoped the 
rhetoric would avoid using the USG as a campaign target. 
(Comment:  The Socialists want the June 13 elections to 
vindicate their March 14 electoral victory.  They remain 
stung by criticism that their victory was a result of the 
terrorist attacks). 
 
6.  (C)  Casajuana said that while the GOS likely would 
increase Spanish presence in Afghanistan (and had already 
decided to double their presence as a result of their 
participation in EUROCORPS), it likely would not be able to 
meet all of the requests we put forward.  Casajuana noted, 
however, that the GOS could easily market provision of a 
medical facility  to the Spanish public, simply on a 
humanitarian basis.  He said Spain\'s increase likely would 
focus on the Kabul battalion.  He seemed a bit taken aback by 
the request for a 1000 troops for the Combined Afghanistan 
Forces to rout out the Taliban, but acknowledged that this 
activity was in Spain\'s own counter-terrorist interest. 
Casajuana noted that Spain was also looking at participating 
in a Provisional Reconstruction Team (PRT) with perhaps in 
conjunction with Italy, but did not want to take on a PRT 
alone, as that would indicate responsibilities and resources 
for the long term that Spain was not prepared to undertake. 
 
7.  (C)  DCM also took the opportunity to review USG thinking 
on elements of a draft UNSC resolution on Iraq.  Casajuana 
was aware of our thoughts following his discussions with Dr. 
Rice in Berlin.  Casajuana  raised the issue of the 
two-conference proposal put forward by the Russians.  We 
noted A/S Burns\' comment that the idea had not yet caught 
fire and that we wanted to focus on areas of consensus as we 
pursue this resolution.  Casajuana said Spain was concerned 
about an open-ended mandate for the Multinational Force (MNF) 
and might want to have the resolution provide a one-year, 
renewable mandate for the MNF.  In any case,  Casajuana 
averred that the GOS would play a positive, constructive role 
in developing the resolution, and did not want to make 
trouble for the US.  He said the US and Spain share the 
desire for stability and democracy in Iraq.  Casajuana 
confirmed the GOS would fulfill its monetary commitments made 
at the Madrid Iraq Donors\' conference and would continue its 
participation in the Iraq Core Group. 
 
8.  (C)  Comment:  On Afghanistan, we expect Spain eventually 
to agree to augment the Kabul battalion by some 200 or more 
troops.  They may also provide the medical facility.  We 
doubt they will offer 1000 Spanish troops for the CFC-A. 
Given the Socialists\' desire to avoid any controversy that 
might hurt their changes in the June 13 elections, Zapatero 
will not likely announce Spain\'s increased participation in 
Afghanistan until after the elections but, we expect, still 
before the Istanbul Summit.

SUBJECT: SPAIN: ZAPATERO\'S CHIEF OF STAFF ON AFGHANISTAN 
 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission J. Robert Manzanares, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  DCM Manzanares met May 18 with Jose Enrique 
Serrano, President Zapatero\'s chief of staff.  Serrano said 
the Zapatero government planned to maintain the same 
excellent relations other Spanish governments have had with 
the U.S. since the administration of Socialist president 
Felipe Gonzalez.  Serrano said the GOS likely would make a 
decision on increased participation in Afghanistan and 
assistance to Haiti in the next week or so, but would not 
announce it until after the June 13 European parliamentary 
elections (several days later, Zapatero,s foreign policy 
advisor, who works for Serrano, said even a decision on 
Afghanistan would not be made until after June 13, see 
septel).  With respect to Afghanistan, he said that in light 
of the June 13 European parliamentary elections, the 
government had to be careful on timing to avoid making it 
appear to the public that Spain was simply trading troops in 
Iraq for an increased presence in Afghanistan.  The Zapatero 
government was looking at an increase of about 200 or so 
troops in Afghanistan.  Serrano was aware of our desire for 
more.  On Haiti, GOS is considering the options of providing 
police or troops, but again would have to prime public 
opinion because the Spanish people have little grasp of the 
situation in Haiti.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Serrano, an important contact of the Embassy\'s 
before assuming his current position, said the Zapatero 
government has every intention of maintaining excellent 
relations with the U.S.  Like many of our new Zapatero 
government interlocutors, Serrano pointed to the very good 
relations the last Socialist president, Felipe Gonzalez, had 
with the U.S. and said Zapatero would aim for relations as 
good or better than those that Gonzalez maintained.  Serrano 
in fact had held the same post during the Gonzalez 
administration.  He recalled that despite difficult moments 
such as the Spanish referendum on NATO membership and 
negotiations to terminate the U.S. presence at Torrejon Air 
Base near Madrid, ties with the USG remained good during this 
period, and under Felipe Gonzalez, Spain had joined the 
coalition in the first Iraq war in 1991 to evict Iraq from 
Kuwait. 
 
3.  (C) Serrano said the GOS would not be able to announce an 
increase in its presence in Afghanistan before the June 13 
European Parliament elections, although the president might 
actually make the decision earlier, perhaps in the next week. 
 DCM emphasized the importance of announcing a decision 
before the NATO Summit in Istanbul.  Serrano understood but 
said that given the importance to the Zapatero government of 
winning the June 13 elections handily, it would be difficult 
to announce a decision much before the Summit.  He emphasized 
Spain\'s Iraq contingent will have completely returned to 
Spain by May 27, and the government simply could not risk 
making it look to the public like troops were returning from 
Iraq only to turn around and head for Afghanistan. 
 
4.    DCM said that the USG, after having expressed its 
disappointment with the Iraq troop withdrawal decision, wants 
to move forward with the GOS and wanted to find concrete, 
visible areas of cooperation.  A robust increase in 
Afghanistan would be an important signal, the DCM stressed. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  Serrano echoed what we have heard from 
other GOS officials:  the Zapatero government wants to 
maintain tight relations with the U.S.  He understood the 
U.S. is expecting to see actions to back up the government\'s 
words and gave us positive signals on Afghanistan.  We expect 
Spain to increase modestly its contingent in Afghanistan, 
although the GOS will not likely announce its increase until 
after the June 13 elections.

 (d). 
 
Summary 
 
1.  (C) NEA A/S William Burns paid a five-hour visit to 
Madrid May 18, meeting with President Zapatero\'s new National 
Security Advisor, Carlos Casajuana, and the new Deputy 
Foreign Minister, Bernardino Leon.  The Spanish expressed a 
desire to work with the US on such issues as encouraging 
better relations between Morocco and Algeria, and making 
progress on the Western Sahara.  A/S Burns reviewed US policy 
on Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   On the public 
affairs side, A/S Burns was the featured guest at a 
roundtable for 30 opinion leaders on US Middle East policy at 
a prominent think tank.   He also gave an interview which 
appeared in Spain\'s leading daily, El Pais.  Press coverage 
of the visit was favorable.  Middle East issues were in the 
forefront in Madrid during the Burns visit, which coincided 
with the Israeli Foreign Minister,s visit and the 
Palestinian PM,s visit the following day.   End Summary. 
 
Casajuana: President Zapatero\'s Foreign Policy Advisor 
 
2.  (C) Carles Casajuana, newly appointed Director for 
International Affairs for President Zapatero (analogous to 
National Security Advisor), received A/S Burns at the Moncloa 
Presidential complex.  Casajuana said that despite the 
withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq, the Zapatero 
government looked forward to cooperation with the US. 
Casajuana said the USG reaction to the Spanish pullout had 
been measured and  \"we had avoided a collapse in relations.\" 
 Regarding increasing Spain\'s military forces in Afghanistan, 
Casajuana said that the issue was under active consideration 
but that there had been no final decision. 
 
3.  (C) Casajuana noted that Israeli FM Shalom would meet 
with Zapatero that afternoon and that Palestinian PM Qurei 
would be in Madrid May 20 and would also meet with Zapatero. 
 Casajuana described the Israeli-Palestinian situation as 
\"very bleak.\"   A/S Burns said the US was committed to 
engaging PM Qurei, as evidenced by Qurei\'s meetings with the 
Secretary and NSA Rice in recent days. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
4.   (C) Casajuana raised the March 11 Madrid terror attacks 
on commuter trains.  He said it was \"astonishing\" that 
Moroccans who, by all appearances, were westernized and doing 
reasonably well in Spain, would do this.   The willingness of 
seemingly middle class immigrants to engage in such acts was 
deeply troubling, he said.  Casajuana said this \"sociological 
phenomenon\" merited intense analysis, but speculated that the 
terrorist impulse of ostensibly integrated immigrants stems 
from a deep sense of humiliation.   Casajuana noted that many 
Moroccan immigrants have a positive view of bin Laden. 
Combating this will be a major challenge. 
 
5.  (C) Turning to Iraq, Casajuana said that the UN\'s Brahimi 
had a difficult task, indeed \"we are asking him for a 
miracle\" to form a caretaker government with legitimacy. 
Casajuana again turned to the theme of Arab humiliation. 
The Abu Ghraib prison abuses had intensified existing 
feelings of Arab humiliation.  Casajuana said that \"we are 
extremely concerned\" that public opinion in Spain and 
throughout Europe is so \"terrible\" regarding the US. 
Casajuana added, however, that Spain would play a positive, 
constructive role in the UNSC deliberations on the Iraq 
resolution. 
 
6.   (C) A/S Burns said that the US and Spain could work 
together on the Maghreb.  Casajuana said that Zapatero\'s 
April visit to Casablanca had been a success and that 
Zapatero had made it a top priority to put relations with 
Morocco \"on a different track.\"    Morocco had followed up 
with a visit by the Interior Minister and the King\'s advisors 
to discuss security and counterterrorism issues.    Moratinos 
had already been to Algiers.  Casajuana confirmed that press 
reports on Zapatero,s visit had erroneously left the 
impression that Spain was backing away from the Baker plan. 
Casajuana said the GOS supported the Baker plan. 
 
7.  (C) A/S Burns noted that the US would have the 
opportunity to engage King Mohammed when he visits Washington 
in July.  Bouteflika will also visit Sea Island for the G-8 
Summit in June.  Burns noted that Special Envoy Baker remains 
actively engaged in mediation efforts between Morocco and 
Algeria.  Casajuana agreed and said that the US and Spain 
share the same goal of lessening tensions between Morocco and 
Algeria and that he looked forward to working together on 
this. 
 
Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardino Leon 
 
8.   (C) FM Moratinos was in Brussels during the visit of A/S 
Burns.   In place of Moratinos, Deputy FM Bernardino Leon 
hosted A/S Burns to a working lunch that included other 
members of the MFA team involved in Middle East and North 
African affairs.   Leon began the lunch with the Maghreb.  He 
noted that the Zapatero government seeks \"equilibrium\" in 
Spanish relations with Morocco and Algeria.  The Aznar 
government, having fallen out with Morocco, favored Algeria. 
The Zapatero government would seek to build on good relations 
with Algeria while working to significantly improve relations 
with Morocco. 
 
9.  (C) Leon said there had been no change in the Spanish 
position on Western Sahara despite media reports to the 
contrary.    The media had picked up on friendly comments 
Zapatero had made during his Casablanca visit in April and 
wrongly interpreted this as a change in GOS policy.   Leon 
said that Algeria had also felt that there had a been a 
change in policy and that he has had some \"tough 
conversations\" with Algerian counterparts. 
 
10.  (C) Leon said that with both Spain and Algeria in the 
UNSC there might be possibilities for progress on the Western 
Sahara impasse when the MINURSO mandate comes up once again 
for renewal in six months.  Leon said he looked forward to 
exchanging ideas with the US on this during the next six 
months.    He suggested that the US, France and Spain might 
work together on Western Sahara and on improving 
Algerian-Moroccan relations generally. 
 
11.  (C) A/S Burns said the USG welcomed the opportunity to 
work together with Spain in mending relations between Morocco 
and Algeria, and in making progress on Western Sahara.   A/S 
Burns reiterated that both King Mohammed and President 
Bouteflika would be in the US in the next few months, 
offering opportunities for engagement on this issue. 
 
12.  (C) On Libya, Leon said that he would likely visit there 
in the coming weeks.   Spain would continue to support 
Libya\'s renunciation of terrorism and WMD and its 
reintegration into the international community.   Leon said 
that Zapatero would not go to Libya any time soon, but that 
eventually he would be willing to travel there, as Aznar had 
done.  On Tunisia, Leon said that some repressive tactics by 
the government against the press were \"of concern.\"  Leon 
noted that it was paradoxical that the Tunisian government 
would be heavy handed regarding freedom of speech given 
Tunisia\'s relative prosperity and good record on other rights 
issues. 
 
13.  (C) Turning to Israeli-Palestinian issues, Leon asked 
what topped the list of what the Palestinians need to 
deliver.   A/S Burns stressed the need, as outlined in the 
roadmap, for unity of Palestinian security forces and for 
cracking down on terrorists.   Leon said that Moratinos did 
not want to travel to the Middle East anytime soon. 
Moratinos is interested in moving away from the label of 
being Middle East focused.   He doesn\'t know Latin America, 
for example, and has to get smart on those issues.    Thus, 
Leon indicated he (Leon) would be the one focusing most 
closely on the Middle East for MFA and that he would \"protect 
Miguel (Moratinos) for a while.\"  Leon said he had recently 
met with Arafat; he and Burns differed on the appropriate 
role for Arafat, as the U.S. continues to make clear that 
Arafat is not a viable partner. 
 
14.  (C) Leon stressed his interest in working with A/S Burns 
and the USG on these issues.   He said that EU budget support 
was critical for Arafat and the EU would use it as a lever. 
 If Israel withdraws completely from Gaza, the EU would 
pressure Arafat to make concessions, Leon said. 
 
15.  (C) Moving to Syria, Leon confirmed that Bashir Assad 
was likely to visit around June 1-2.  Leon said he would go 
to Damascus before Assad\'s visit to push for a serious agenda 
for the trip.   He said that if there was something the US 
wanted Spain to convey, \"let us know.\" 
 
16.  (C) On a new UNSCR for Iraq, Leon said that we agree on 
the \"main lines.\"   The Spanish side believes that \"positions 
seem to be converging\" and that there is widening consensus 
among EU partners.   Leon said Spain would play a 
constructive role in the UNSC on this issue and would not 
work on parallel tracks.  A/S Burns noted that the Russian 
idea for two resolutions had not caught fire with anyone. 
Leon said Spain was still examining the idea. 
 
17.   (C) Burns noted our continued desire for reform in the 
Middle East, and said that he hoped the Arab League summit 
(which Tunisian President Ben Ali had told him would be held) 
would endorse regional reform.  This remains an important 
project, which should focus on concrete steps and problems. 
Leon agreed, adding that Spain appreciated that the 
initiative would not supercede the Barcelona process; Burns 
noted the need for continued complementarity and said that 
the initiative was not meant to overtake other processes. 
Public Affairs 
18.  (C) A/S Burns had an on-the-record roundtable at the 
FRIDE think tank during his visit.   FRIDE has associations 
with FM Moratinos and the Socialist party.   In attendance 
were 30 prominent opinion leaders.  In addition, A/S Burns 
gave an interview to leading daily El Pais.   El Pais ran a 
favorable story about his visit on May 19, as did the 
conservative daily, ABC. 
 
Comment 
 
19.  (C) Casajuana and Leon were cordial and cooperative in 
their meetings with A/S Burns, as they have been in other 
early encounters we have had since they assumed office in 
April.  Despite the strong criticism of the US from the 
Socialist party, foreign policy interlocutors in the Zapatero 
government continue to express the desire to work closely 
with us.  Political optics are, however, paramount to 
Zapatero and his inner circle.   Regardless of the goodwill 
expressed by our foreign policy interlocutors, their room for 
maneuver is limited by the political considerations that are 
paramount right now in the Socialist government\'s strategy.

1.  Embassy welcomes and grants country clearance to Amanda 
Smith, Project Manager, DHAP, NCHSTP, CDC, DHHS to travel to 
Tenerife, June 8-12 to attend the XIII International HIV Drug 
Resistance Workshop. 
 
2.  Embassy understands that no assistance is necessary. 
 
3.  Visitors are reminded that bearers of diplomatic and 
official passports coming to Spain on official business need 
to obtain a Spanish visa prior to arrival in Spain. 
 
4.  THREAT ASSESSMENT: 
 
In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. 
In the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel/state.gov.  In addition to information on the 
Internet, U.S. travelers can hear recorded information by 
calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at

ESTABLISH BILATERAL OPEN SKIES RELATIONSHIP 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 91041 
 
     B. MADRID 1833 
 
1.  We sent reftel A talking points in a letter welcoming 
Spain,s new Director General of Civil Aviation Manuel 
Bautista Perez and requesting an introductory appointment. 
To our surprise, Bautista responded notifying us of the GOS\'s 
\"intent\" to establish an open skies relationship. 
 
2.  An informal translation of the relevant paragraphs follow: 
 
Begin informal translation: 
As you already know, Spain actively takes part in the (US-EU) 
negotiations that are being held, and has supported with 
determination the work directed at reaching greater 
cooperation in competitive matters, common regulation and 
progressive market access liberalization for the companies of 
both parties. 
 
On the other hand, and as it was declared in previous 
occasions to the Embassy as well as to representatives of the 
Department of State and Department of Transportation of the 
United States, Spain has the intention of establishing an 
open skies relationship with the United States which permits 
resolution, as soon as possible, of the current disadvantaged 
situation of Spanish companies compared with companies of 
other Member States that have concluded open skies agreements 
with the U.S. 
 
End Translation 
 
3.  Bautista also promised to contact us \"as soon as 
possible\" to set up a meeting.  We will clarify with him 
Spain\'s willingness to enter into bilateral open skies 
negotiations. 
 
4.  Comment:  The GOS has expressed concern several times 
before about the unequal status of Spanish airlines compared 
with airlines of member states with open skies agreements 
(see ref B).  But this is the first time the GOS has 
expressed an \"intention of establishing an open skies 
relationship\" that is not contingent upon the consent of 
Brussels.  We will seek more detail about GOS plans when we 
meet with Bautista.  End Comment.

opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. 
In the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s

Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program

E.O. 12958: DECL: 05/21/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SP, NATO, American - Spanish Relations 
SUBJECT: SPAIN: ZAPATERO\'S CHIEF OF STAFF ON AFGHANISTAN 
(CORRECTED COPY) 
 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission J. Robert Manzanares, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  DCM Manzanares met May 18 with Jose Enrique 
Serrano, President Zapatero\'s chief of staff.  Serrano said 
the Zapatero government planned to maintain the same 
excellent relations other Spanish governments have had with 
the U.S. since the administration of Socialist president 
Felipe Gonzalez.  Serrano said the GOS likely would make a 
decision on increased participation in Afghanistan and 
assistance to Haiti in the next week or so, but would not 
announce it until after the June 13 European parliamentary 
elections (several days later, Zapatero,s foreign policy 
advisor, who works for Serrano, said even a decision on 
Afghanistan would not be made until after June 13, see 
septel).  With respect to Afghanistan, he said that in light 
of the June 13 European parliamentary elections, the 
government had to be careful on timing to avoid making it 
appear to the public that Spain was simply trading troops in 
Iraq for an increased presence in Afghanistan.  The Zapatero 
government was looking at an increase of about 200 or so 
troops in Afghanistan.  Serrano was aware of our desire for 
more.  On Haiti, GOS is considering the options of providing 
police or troops, but again would have to prime public 
opinion because the Spanish people have little grasp of the 
situation in Haiti.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Serrano, an important contact of the Embassy\'s 
before assuming his current position, said the Zapatero 
government has every intention of maintaining excellent 
relations with the U.S.  Like many of our new Zapatero 
government interlocutors, Serrano pointed to the very good 
relations the last Socialist president, Felipe Gonzalez, had 
with the U.S. and said Zapatero would aim for relations as 
good or better than those that Gonzalez maintained.  Serrano 
in fact had held the same post during the Gonzalez 
administration.  He recalled that despite difficult moments 
such as the Spanish referendum on NATO membership and 
negotiations to terminate the U.S. presence at Torrejon Air 
Base near Madrid, ties with the USG remained good during this 
period, and under Felipe Gonzalez, Spain had joined the 
coalition in the first Iraq war in 1991 to evict Iraq from 
Kuwait. 
 
3.  (C) Serrano said the GOS would not be able to announce an 
increase in its presence in Afghanistan before the June 13 
European Parliament elections, although the president might 
actually make the decision earlier, perhaps in the next week. 
 DCM emphasized the importance of announcing a decision 
before the NATO Summit in Istanbul.  Serrano understood but 
said that given the importance to the Zapatero government of 
winning the June 13 elections handily, it would be difficult 
to announce a decision much before the Summit.  He emphasized 
Spain\'s Iraq contingent will have completely returned to 
Spain by May 27, and the government simply could not risk 
making it look to the public like troops were returning from 
Iraq only to turn around and head for Afghanistan. 
 
4.  (C) DCM said that the USG, after having expressed its 
disappointment with the Iraq troop withdrawal decision, wants 
to move forward with the GOS and wanted to find concrete, 
visible areas of cooperation.  A robust increase in 
Afghanistan would be an important signal, the DCM stressed. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  Serrano echoed what we have heard from 
other GOS officials:  the Zapatero government wants to 
maintain tight relations with the U.S.  He understood the 
U.S. is expecting to see actions to back up the government\'s 
words and gave us positive signals on Afghanistan.  We expect 
Spain to increase modestly its contingent in Afghanistan, 
although the GOS will not likely announce its increase until 
after the June 13 elections.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EFIN, ECON, PTER, ETTC, SP, Counterterrorism, Trade Issues 
SUBJECT: SPAIN\'S ECONOMY MINISTER LOOKS FOR FISCAL 
DISCIPLINE AND PRODUCTIVITY, PROMISES SUPPORT ON TERRORISM 
FINANCE 
 
 
1. Summary.  Second Vice President and Minister of Economy 
and Finance Pedro Solbes described to Ambassador May 27 his 
role in the Zapatero government as finding a balance between 
the \"excess enthusiasm\" of his fellow ministers and 
maintaining the fiscal discipline committed to by President 
Zapatero.  Calling the recent model of Spanish economic 
growth built on domestic demand and construction exhausted, 
Solbes foreshadowed more government investment in education 
and research and development to improve Spain\'s  productivity 
and competitiveness.  The Ambassador transmitted the concern 
he was hearing from the American business community regarding 
recent statements by members of the Zapatero government which 
could be interpreted as anti-American, encouraging Solbes to 
reach out directly to the U.S. business community. Solbes 
signaled Spain\'s willingness to continue its close 
cooperation with the U.S. on terrorism finance, acknowledging 
the need for urgent passage of implementing regulations for 
Spain\'s terrorism finance law and better coordination on 
designations for terrorist asset freezing.  End Summary. 
 
Tone Down the Rhetoric 
 
2.  Ambassador opened the May 27 meeting by voicing the 
concern he was hearing from the U.S. business community over 
the rhetoric used by the Zapatero government in the runup to 
the June 13 European Parliament elections.  The Ambassador 
emphasized that for the past five years, the U.S. had been 
Spain\'s leading foreign direct investor, bringing in over $42 
billion in FDI.  This important constituency was nervous. The 
Ambassador noted U.S.-Spanish bilateral trade and investment 
still had much potential and room for growth.  The Ambassador 
encouraged Solbes to reach out, perhaps speaking to the 
American business groups at a luncheon.  Solbes concurred, 
emphasizing the Zapatero government wanted the best possible 
cooperation with the U.S., not just in business but across 
the board. 
 
Fiscal Discipline and the Need for Productivity Growth 
 
3.  Emphasizing that he had not participated in the 
development of the Socialist Party\'s (PSOE) economic program, 
Solbes described his job as a balancing act between the 
\"excess enthusiasm\" of some of his government colleagues and 
maintaining the fiscal discipline promised during the 
campaign by President Zapatero.  Solbes lamented the 
perception that the Aznar government had left everything in 
the economic sphere in wonderful shape.  In reality, there 
were still many structural reforms to be made.  Spanish 
economic growth in recent years was overly dependent on 
domestic demand, particularly the construction sector.  Spain 
needed more investment in education and research and 
development to improve productivity.  In response to the 
Ambassador\'s query on the vulnerability of the housing 
sector, Solbes said the government needed to introduce more 
transparency into housing policy.  Solbes noted that Spain 
spent 40% of GDP on social programs, relatively low compared 
to some EU countries, but probably still too high.  Health 
care costs amounted to 10% of GDP, but were steadily rising. 
The Ambassador noted the lack of flexibility of labor markets 
remained a major problem,  Solbes agreed, but observed  that 
it had been a problem for years and slowly but surely was 
improving.  A culture change was needed as well.  Judges 
always sided with the employee  seeing him as poor and 
exploited and the employer as wealthy.  Still, Solbes said, 
compared to France, Germany or Italy, while Spain\'s standard 
of living might be somewhat lower, its economy was much more 
flexible. 
 
Terrorism Finance:  A Strong Partner 
 
4.  The Ambassador noted our strong desire to continue 
working closely with Spain in the war against terrorism 
finance, and thanked Solbes for Spain\'s leadership in this 
area.  Solbes committed that Spain would continue to be a 
strong partner on terrorism finance.  It would work within 
the EU framework and encourage greater US-EU cooperation in 
this area.  He understood the importance of swift government 
approval of implementing regulations for Spain\'s 2003 
terrorist finance law given continued delays and acknowledged 
traditional attitudes exhibited by some parts of the 
government slowed our ability to work together on jointly 
designating and freezing suspect assets.

1.  (C)  SUMMARY  Spanish MFA Political Director Dezcallar, 
who now has overall Iraq responsibility in the MFA, told us 
June 3 that Spain appreciated the constructive and positive 
attitude evident in the US-UK revised text.  He said Spanish 
President Zapatero personally had instructed Spanish UN Perm 
Rep to be \"helpful\" in seeking to forge consensus.  On the 
revised text, Spain would like to see further clarification 
of the end date of the MNF mandate, but is willing to discuss 
pros and cons of leaving the date \"indeterminate.\"   The GOS 
wants a specific reference to \"international humanitarian 
law,\" but Dezcallar insisted that the kind of clause Spain 
would desire would be forward-looking, not refer to past 
events (e.g. prisoner abuse allegations).  Spain would also 
welcome further clarification on the relationship between the 
IIG and the MNF, and seeks language on this relationship to 
reinforce, not undermine, Iraqi sovereignty.  The GOS would 
prefer a 3-month schedule for MNF reports to the Security 
Council, rather than the 6-month schedule envisaged in the 
current text.  Dezcallar professed that none of these issues 
was a deal breaker for Spain, but identified the IIG-MNF 
relationship as the most serious issue for the GOS.  The 
Zapatero government clearly wants the US to see Spain as a 
positive factor in developing the UNSC resolution on Iraq; 
however, the GOS will not hesitate to raise difficult 
\"details.\"  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (C)  In a June 3 meeting with MFA Political Director 
Dezcallar, who has overall responsibility for Iraq in the 
MFA, and will take over Iraq responsibilities formerly housed 
in the MOD, PolCouns reviewed USG thinking on the revised 
Iraq UNSC resolution (ref a) and urged strong GOS support, 
including in public statements, for the new Iraqi interim 
government (ref B).  PolCouns noted USG,s desire to move 
quickly in adopting the resolution, as a firm expression of 
international support for the new government. 
 
3.  (C) As have previous GOS interlocutors over the past 
several weeks, Dezcallar said that President Zapatero had 
personally instructed the MFA to play a constructive role in 
crafting the new UNSC resolution.  \"We have learned our 
lessons from past mistakes,\" Dezcallar noted, clearly 
referring to the Villepin parallel text process during the 
negotiations of 1483.  Dezcallar expressed appreciation for 
the positive U.S. and UK attitude, clearly reflected in the 
elements of the revised text that sought to meet concerns 
expressed previously by Council members.  He asked when the 
USG might want to put the text to a vote; PolCouns responded 
that the USG preferred to move sooner rather than wait for 
discussions to take place among non-Council members such as 
Iraq,s neighbors, as other members of the Council had 
suggested.  She added that while these views were important, 
the priority was to demonstrate support for the new 
government and the political transition process.  Dezcallar 
did not further comment on Spain,s view on timing. 
 
4.  (C) Dezcallar identified several key concerns for the GOS 
(roughly paralleling issues raised by the Spanish Perm Rep in 
New York), as detailed below. 
 
5.  (C) Reference to \"International Humanitarian Law:\"  The 
GOS wants a specific reference to \"international humanitarian 
law\" in the text; the Spanish Perm Rep has made this point in 
NY; subsequent to the conversation with Dezcallar, Foreign 
Minister Moratinos, in a press conference in Finland, said 
the text should include such a specific reference.  Dezcallar 
told us that, unlike the \"Chinese proposal,\"  which referred 
to past actions in Iraq (e.g. prisoner abuses), Spain\'s 
preference would be for language that looked forward to the 
future.  He said that the U.S. should welcome, not fear, such 
a reference, and thought that the U.S. should have as much 
interest in seeing it included as Spain or any other Council 
member.  Dezcallar opined that the UK supported some language 
referring to humanitarian law. 
 
6.  (C)  We asked why the reference to \"international law\" 
that is already in the text was not sufficient, since it 
obviously incorporates humanitarian law.  In addition, 
preambular language also refers to human rights.  Dezcallar 
responded that it would be important for the Iraqis to have 
the Council specifically to refer to humanitarian law.  He 
indicated that this might well be handled in preambular 
language rather than in the operative portion of the text. 
Dezcallar also took the opportunity to note that Spain 
understood the prisoner abuses were undertaken by a few, and 
that in our transparent democratic system they were being 
prosecuted in accordance with due process.  He noted 
President Zapatero,s comments to that effect on the margins 
of the EU-Latin America summit, in which Zapatero also said 
that the U.S. government was not to blame for the prisoner 
abuses. 
 
7.  (C)  MNF reporting schedule:   As the Spanish Perm Rep 
noted in UNSC informals, Spain would like the MNF to report 
every three months to the Council, which the SYG would also 
be called upon to do.  Dezcallar said that a three-month 
schedule would be a very good signal on the part of the MNF 
to the Iraqis.  He noted that on a six month schedule, the 
MNF might end up reporting only once to the Council (say, if 
MNF mandate ends with elections at the end of this year or 
early next year).  Again, this is not a deal breaker, 
Dezcallar indicated, but something Spain wants to be 
considered and would like to see incorporated in the text. 
 
8.  (C)  IIG-MNF relations:  By far this is one of the most 
important issues for the GOS, Dezcallar said.  Spain would 
like more clarification on how the U.S. would envisage this 
relationship, and noted that the resolution language on this 
issue must not be seen in any way to undermine Iraqi 
sovereignty.  Dezcaller referred to a meeting between Deputy 
Secretary Armitage and Secretary-General, EU High 
 
SIPDIS 
Representative Solana on this issue, in which Armitage had 
identified a number of scenarios in which the IIG and the MNG 
would have to develop arrangements.  According to 
Dezcallar,s readout, Armitage and Solana noted that 
operations on which all agreed would not be problematic, nor 
would defensive operations in which MNF troops clearly had to 
conduct an operation to defend themselves.  The most 
problematic, would be an offensive operation which the IIG 
did not approve. 
 
9.  (C)  PolCouns noted that the USG certainly shared Spain\'s 
desire to reinforce, not undermine, Iraqi sovereignty in the 
resolution text.  She also noted Secretary Powell\'s June 2 
interview at the Middle East broadcasting center in which he 
identified excellent examples of how this can be worked out 
with a sovereign nation, such as with Germany and Korea where 
our troops have been based for the past 50 years.  When asked 
whether Spain wanted more specific language on the 
relationship issue,  Dezcallar was unclear, but said the GOS 
would welcome further details on USG thinking on the 
arrangements between the IIG and the MNF.  We discussed the 
exchange of two letters process, in which the IIG would 
communicate with the UNSC to express its desire for the MNF 
to remain, and the lead MNF nation would send a letter also 
outlining in general terms the process by which relations 
would be developed. 
 
10.  (C)  End of MNF mandate:  Dezcallar noted Spain,s 
concern that the closure of the MNF mandate remains too 
\"indeterminate\" in the current text, which envisages the 
mandate to end at the end of the political process leading to 
democratization.  Dezcallar acknowledged that flexibility on 
the date might be beneficial, but said the Council should 
discuss pros and cons of further clarifying the sunset 
clause.  (FM Moratinos in Finland subsequently said publicly 
that \"the sooner we give the Iraqi people a clear sign that 
the multinational troops will leave Iraq, the better.\"). 
Dezcallar declared the GOS \"flexible\" on this issue, however, 
but would welcome further discussion in New York. 
 
11.  (C)  Comment:   The Zapatero government clearly wants us 
to view Spain as helpful in the UNSC on the Iraq resolution - 
even as it raises \"details\" that could be difficult to work 
out.

SUBJECT: SPAIN-SYRIA:  ASAD VISIT TO MADRID 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.   (C)  Summary:  Spanish MFA Political Director Dezcallar 
told us that Syrian President Asad during his June 1-2 visit 
to Madrid indicated he was fully willing to \"go all the way8 
with Israel to achieve peace ) but on the basis of the 
return of all Syrian territory.  However, the Syrians said 
that water and navigation rights related to Lake Tiberias 
were not important to them; Syria wanted the symbolic 
satisfaction of having all of its territory returned, 
according to Dezcallar.  The GOS also found it significant 
that Asad had agreed to condemn \"all forms of terrorism.8 
On WMD, Dezcallar said that the Syrians agreed to 
reinvigorate a Syria-Spain dialogue on the issue, and noted 
that both sides had called for a \"weapons of mass 
destruction-free zone8 in the Middle East.  Dezcallar 
acknowledged that Asad gave nothing on securing the border 
with Iraq.  He said that Asad praised Spain\'s new \"positive 
image\" in the Arab world since the Iraq troop withdrawal 
decision.  He averred that Spain,s new role might be 
\"useful\" to the US with Syria or on other issues.  End 
summary 
 
2.  (C)  On the heels of visits to Madrid by Israeli FM 
Shalom and Palestinian PM Qorei, Syrian President Bashar Asad 
paid a visit to Spain to meet with King Juan Carlos (who paid 
a State visit to Syria in October, 2003), Spanish President 
Zapatero and FM Moratinos.  The Spanish press gave extensive 
and favorable coverage to the visit, and Asad and Zapatero 
issued a joint communiqu in which they agreed to broaden and 
deepen Syrian-Spanish relations.  The widely publicized 
communiqu states their agreement that peace in the Middle 
East could only be achieved through a \"just and 
comprehensive\" solution, and reaffirms the principles of the 
Madrid Middle East Peace Conference in October 1991 and 
relevant UNSC resolutions. 
 
3.  (C)  The communiqu also states that both states condemn 
\"all forms of terrorism,\" in particular the March 11 
terrorist attacks in Madrid.  Both sides vowed to renew their 
commitment to cooperate and contribute whatever efforts 
necessary to combat international terrorism under the 
auspices of the United Nations.  Both governments expressed 
\"solidarity with the Iraqi people8 and their desire for 
return of full Iraqi sovereignty and independence.  The 
communiqu also calls on the international community to work 
actively to achieve these objectives, with a central UN role 
in all of these efforts.  The two sides also agreed to work 
toward making the Middle East a \"Weapons of Mass Destruction 
free zone\" and to maintain a \"frank and constructive\" 
dialogue on this issue.  Spain also agreed to work to 
conclude an EU-Syria association agreement. 
 
4.  (C)  We discussed the Asad visit with MFA Political 
Director Dezcallar on the margins of a discussion on the Iraq 
UNSCR (septel).  When asked whether the Spanish government 
had pressed Asad on ending support for terrorism, Dezcallar 
said he and his colleagues found it significant that Asad had 
been willing to condemn \"all forms of terrorism.\"   He 
believes this can help open a \"channel of dialogue\" with the 
Syrians on this issue.  Dezcallar noted Asad,s comment that 
Spain,s decision to withdraw its troops in Iraq had given 
Spain a new, more \"positive\" image in the Arab world.  Spain 
is taking an active role in the region, given FM Moratinos, 
previous experience in the region as EU envoy, and Spain,s 
new lines of dialogue could be \"useful\" to the U.S., 
Dezcallar said. 
 
5.  (C)  Asked whether Spain had pressed Asad on Weapons of 
Mass Destruction, Dezcallar said that Syria had agreed to 
renew a dialogue with Spain on the issue, and that this could 
also be helpful to us.  He had no comment on the pledge of 
support for a \"Weapons of Mass Destruction-free zone\" in the 
Middle East.  (There was no reference to Israeli nuclear 
issues.) 
 
6.  (C)  On the Iraq-Syria border, Dezcallar admitted that 
Asad had addressed this issue only in general terms, and had 
refused to acknowledged Syria,s own complicity in this area. 
 While Zapatero had publicly accepted Asad,s invitation to 
visit Syria, Dezcallar downplayed this, saying that no dates 
had been set and that \"we shall see\" when such a visit could 
take place. 
 
7.  (C)  Dezcallar highlighted Asad,s comments to his 
Spanish interlocutors on the Middle East peace process and 
relations with Israel.  Dezcallar said Asad indicated Syria 
was willing to \"go all the way\" with Israel to make peace, 
but on the basis of return of all of Syrian occupied 
territory.  Dezcallar insisted that the Syrians gave a \"clear 
message\" that they want peace, and were willing to forego 
water and navigation rights over Lake Tiberias as long as the 
200 kilometers of shoreline is returned to Syria.  What is 
important for Syria, Dezcallar said, is the symbolic 
significance of the return of all of its territory. 
 
8.  (C)  Comment:  This has been an extremely busy \"Middle 
East8 period for the new Spanish government, with visits in 
the last two weeks by Israeli FM Shalom, Palestinian PM 
Qorei, Assistant Secretary of State Bill Burns, as well as 
visits to the region and North Africa by MFA Deputy Foreign 
Minister Bernardino Leon.  Clearly the new government wants 
to be a player on Middle East issues and believes, correctly 
or not, that its Iraq decision has provided new found 
\"respect8 for Spain in the Arab/Muslim world.  Further, 
Moratinos will continue to remain active in his old EU 
portfolio.  It will be important for the USG to maintain 
close contact with our Spanish interlocutors on Middle East 
issues, in the hope of trying to avoid unhelpful messages or 
signals.

SUBJECT: SPAIN:  ENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
1.  This cable summarizes selected developments in the 
Spain\'s energy sector.  In this issue: 
 
-- New Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce responsible 
for energy policy (para 2) 
-- Possible merger of gas, electricity and water companies 
(para 3) 
-- Low gas supply reserve may lead to brownouts this winter 
(para 4) 
-- Iberian single market for electricity delayed (para 5) 
-- \"Coal is important to Spain\" says new Industry Minister 
(para 6) 
 
2.  NEW MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY, TOURISM AND COMMERCE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ENERGY POLICY 
Energy policy is now primarily the responsibility of Spain\'s 
newly formed Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce 
(Ministry of Industry), headed by Minister Jose Montilla 
Aguilera, a Catalan who has a reputation for being serious 
and disciplined.  In a recent interview Montilla stated that 
the principle aim of energy policy is \"to guarantee supply 
and quality.\"  He said that the coal mining industry is 
important to Spain and affirmed that no new Spanish nuclear 
power plants should be expected, in line with PSOE election 
pledges.  Montilla also said that the new GOS will be serious 
about its commitment to the environment and will fulfill its 
Kyoto commitments \"in a way that is manageable and without 
putting at risk the competitiveness of sectors affected by\" 
these commitments. 
 
3.  POSSIBLE MERGER OF GAS, ELECTRICITY AND WATER COMPANIES 
Recent reports indicate that Spain\'s dominant natural gas 
supplier Gas Natural is again attempting to merge with other 
energy companies following an unsuccessful attempt last year 
to merge with electricity company Iberdrola.  Its preferred 
plan reportedly is a triple merger between the country\'s 
leading electricity supplier, Endesa, with 40 percent of the 
electricity market and the water utility Aguas de Barcelona 
(Agbar).  According to 2003 figures, a merger of the three 
companies would result in an entity with revenues of 16.2 
billion euros (USD19.83 billion at EUR1.0=USD0.816), offering 
water, gas and electricity services.  Pro forma earnings for 
last year would have been about 2 billion euros (2.45 billion 
dollars).  Industry Minister Montilla said in a recent 
interview that while he has not seen a formal proposal, \"our 
intention is not to interfere.\"  While Gas Natural officially 
denies any moves to create such a merger, reports indicate 
that around 30 employees of the three companies have been 
working on a deal for the last two months, and that an 
announcement is being delayed until after the EU elections. 
COMMENT:  This merger would create an extremely large energy 
company that may be based in the region of Catalonia (which 
includes Barcelona).  Some experts believe that last year\'s 
merger was not permitted in part because its power base would 
have shifted to Barcelona, rather than remaining in Madrid. 
Montilla\'s comments suggest his Ministry would not oppose the 
merger.  However, the merger would still require approval of 
the competition and energy regulators.  End Comment. 
 
4.  LOW GAS SUPPLY RESERVE MAY LEAD TO BROWNOUTS THIS WINTER 
Spain could face an energy crisis this winter unless gas 
suppliers increase reserves, according to Pedro Mielgo, 
chairman of Spain\'s national electricity grid operator, Red 
Electrica de Espana (REE).  Per Mielgo, gas suppliers are 
maintaining minimal reserves while at the same time, Spain\'s 
gas-fired power plants are becoming Spain\'s main source of 
electricity.  Reportedly, natural gas suppliers are 
maintaining their reserves at less than half their full 
capacity, due to the high cost of gas and other fuels. 
According to the gas sector association Sedigas, demand for 
natural gas rose 16.4 percent in the first quarter from a 
year earlier to 86,660 gigawatt hours.  Reserves, however, 
have not increased proportionally.  Mielgo noted that REE is 
working closely with Spain\'s principal gas distributor Enagas 
and Industry Minister Montilla to avoid an energy crisis this 
winter.  The National Energy Commission (CNE) warned gas 
suppliers that they will face sanctions if they fail to keep 
reserves above minimum levels.  According to the 1998 
Hydrocarbons Law, suppliers must have minimum reserves 
equivalent to 35 days of consumption.  However, Enagas claims 
that only five out of 12 gas suppliers are currently due to 
have reserves at the end of the year. 
 
5.  IBERIAN SINGLE MARKET FOR ELECTRICITY DELAYED 
Once scheduled to begin in April, the tying together of the 
production and supply of electricity between Spain and 
Portugal will likely suffer further delay, reportedly due to 
delays in approvals by the National Energy Commission and the 
Council of State resulting from the recent change of 
government.  Nevertheless, many electricity companies believe 
that the delays will have a limited initial impact, at least 
until connections supporting 1,100 more megawatts are laid. 
Currently, Spain and Portugal have interconnectivity of 
between 600 and 1,100 megawatts at peak times.  With EU 
financing, this reportedly will double by 2005. 
 
6.  \"COAL IS IMPORTANT TO SPAIN\" SAYS NEW INDUSTRY MINISTER 
In a recent interview, Montilla argued for the need to 
maintain the Spanish coal industry by saying that Spain must 
have \"a diversified sector and coal has its place.\"  Montilla 
added \"We have little water, few nuclear plants and little 
renewable energy.  And it would make no sense to import coal 
and rid ourselves of national production because even though 
it\'s lost ground it is still important and it\'s vital for 
certain regions.\"  COMMENT:  Spain\'s coal costs far more than 
current world market prices.  But political factors make 
total shutdown difficult, with coal production centered in 
northern regions of the country which already suffer from 
high unemployment.  The GOS has been under investigation by 
the EC for several years regarding government support of the 
coal industry of as much as 600 million euros (735 million 
dollars) in contradiction of EU rules.  End Comment.

2.  NEW MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY, TOURISM AND COMMERCE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR TELECOM ISSUES 
Telecommunications issues are now primarily the 
responsibility of Spain\'s newly formed Ministry of Industry, 
Commerce and Tourism (Ministry of Industry), headed by 
Minister Jose Montilla Aguilera, a Catalan who has a 
reputation for being serious and disciplined.  He also 
remains the secretary general of the Catalan Socialist Party, 
and has shown that his loyalties to Catalonia (which includes 
Barcelona) are steadfast (see ref A).  In a recent interview 
Montilla said the GOS is studying the possible consequences 
of liberalization of telephone rates which the former 
government had planned for 2005.  Montilla demurred to a 
question about financing of universal service, which industry 
has been expected to shoulder in the past, by stating that 
the ministry must first study and define what services should 
be provided to all of Spain before determining how to fund 
universal service. 
 
3.  SPAIN\'S PUBLIC TELEVISION STATIONS UNDER REVIEW 
With a huge deficit (currently at around 8 billion euros or 
9.79 billion dollars) and a reputation as the government 
propaganda mouthpiece since the 1970s, the possible reform of 
Spain\'s publicly-owned television company (RTVE) has been a 
perennial source of campaign promises during national 
elections.  During his campaign, President Zapatero vowed to 
create a committee of experts to study the problem.  He has 
already made good on this commitment, establishing a group to 
come up with recommendations by early 2005.  He also has 
replaced the head of RTVE with Carmen Caffarel, who has been 
described as an \"independent academic.\"  Some of the 
challenges facing Caffarel and the committee of experts are 
how to shrink the company\'s deficit, work with the unions 
that will fight moves to shrink its 8,000-strong workforce, 
define the role of public television in Spain, and free RTVE 
of political influence.  State Secretary for Finance Miguel 
Angel Fernandez Ordonez, who is committed to fiscal restraint 
(see ref B), recently mentioned that privatization of RTVE 
was being considered in order to improve the company\'s 
finances.  Caffarel opposes the privatization but says she 
intends to make RTVE an independent entity. 
 
4.  NEW OFFICE TO DEFEND TELECOM USERS 
A new Defender of Information and Communication Technologies 
Users has been established by the Ministry of Industry.  This 
official will have responsibility for addressing citizen 
complaints regarding Internet connections and mobile 
telephone contract terms.  Complaints for telephone service 
and Internet connection deficiencies have increased 
exponentially in the last few years. 
 
5.  TELEFONICA MOVILES AND VODAFONE ESPANA LAUNCH 3G (UMTS) 
SERVICES 
Both Telefonica Moviles and Vodafone Espana launched 3G 
(UMTS) services in Spain during the last week of May. 
Telefonica Moviles, a subsidiary of Group Telefonica, will 
initially provide UMTS services in Madrid, Barcelona, and 
other large cities in Spain.  Javier Aguilera, CEO of 
Telefonica Moviles, expects mass usage of UMTS facilities to 
be a reality by the end of 2005.  Between 2003 and 2006, 
Telefonica Moviles plans to invest 1 billion euros (1.22 
billion dollars) to develop its UMTS service.  Vodafone 
Espana launched its services one day after Telefonica 
Moviles.  While offering services initially to 22 Spanish 
cities representing 23 percent of the population, Vodafone 
Espana plans to extend the service to all of the country\'s 
provincial capitals by the end of the year.  Meanwhile, the 
GOS is reviewing UMTS licensing agreements to ensure that all 
four of Spain\'s UMTS license holders (also Amena and Xfera) 
establish services and comply with their agreements. 
 
6.  SPAIN\'S ADSL SUBSCRIBER BASE UP; TELEFONICA PROPOSES 
DOUBLING ITS CONNECTION SPEED 
As of April, Spain had 1.9 million ADSL subscribers.  At the 
current rate, Spain will have 3 million ADSL lines by the end 
of 2005, according to Spain\'s Association of Internauts 
(Internet users).  Telefonica\'s 1.2 million ADSL subscribers 
may soon benefit from doubling of connection speed at no 
extra charge if CMT, Spain\'s telecom regulatory body, 
authorizes the proposed plans.  This will involve an 
investment by Telefonica of as much as 100 million euros 
(1.22 billion dollars).  COMMENT:  An intriguing aspect of 
the proposed promotion is how it challenges Telefonica\'s 
competitors:  Telefonica owns virtually all of the fixed-line 
infrastructure in Spain and is required to provide its 
competitors access to its network.   Regulations prohibit 
Telefonica from differentiating its competitor-clients from 
its other clients when upgrading this type of service.  So 
the added speed will be passed on to Terra, Wanadoo, Tiscali, 
Ya.Com, etc. for no extra charge.  However, these competitors 
would need to incur some unanticipated investment costs to 
pass the increased speed on to their retail clients. 
Although not required by regulation to benefit their clients 
with the doubled speed, Telefonica\'s competitors risk losing 
significant client base to Telefonica if they don\'t.  End 
Comment. 
 
7.  TELEFONICA MOVILES CONTINUING TELEFONICA\'S INCREASING 
INFLUENCE IN LATIN AMERICA 
Telefonica Moviles will fully acquire Telefonica Movil Chile 
from Compania de Telecomunicaciones de Chile (CMT) for a 
little over 1 billion euros (1.22 billion dollars).  Under 
management by Telefonica Moviles since 2000, with parent 
company Telefonica already holding a 43.6 percent share of 
CMT, analysts say that although the deal appears overpriced, 
consolidation makes \"strategic sense.\"

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SP, PSOE - Socialist Party, Spanish Election March 2004 
SUBJECT: SPAIN\'S ZAPATERO: STILL IN CAMPAIGN MODE 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Almost three months after his electoral 
victory and a month and a half after formally taking office, 
Spanish President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and his 
Spanish Socialist Worker\'s Party (PSOE) remain in campaign 
mode, intensely focused on winning a decisive victory for 
Spanish socialist candidates in the European Parliament 
elections June 13.  Zapatero and his party want to be able to 
point to such a victory as confirmation that their March 14 
election was not a fluke or a sop to the terrorists who 
attacked a Madrid rail station just three days before the 
national elections.  Every decision the new government has 
taken since the elections, including Zapatero\'s decision to 
withdraw troops from Iraq, his trips to France, Germany and 
Mexico, Spain\'s desire to abstain on the UNSC ICC rollover 
resolution, and his plan to delay any decision on increasing 
Spanish troops in Afghanistan are part of this June 13 win 
big strategy.  After June 13, we expect Zapatero and his 
party to ease some of their rhetoric, but we are skeptical 
that there will be any sea change on issues on which the 
Spanish public has strong opinions, particularly those that 
distinguish the new government from that of Aznar,s. 
Zapatero will follow, not lead the Spanish public.  Still, we 
continue to press the Zapatero government to make good on 
their professed desire to have good relations with the U.S. 
by giving us concrete examples of support.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (C)  Still insecure after the March 14 elections that 
took place three days after the Madrid terrorist attacks, the 
PSOE government wants to vindicate its electoral victory by 
scoring a decisive win against Popular Party (PP) candidates 
in the June 13 European Parliament elections (usually a 
yawner here in Spain, but this year a focus of political 
life).  Senior government officials have admitted to us over 
the past several weeks that the GOS will not make key 
decisions, such as whether to increase the Spanish troop 
presence in Afghanistan, until after the June 13 elections. 
The GOS\'s desire to abstain rather than vote in favor of the 
UNSC resolution rolling over the one-year exemption to the 
ICC for those not party to the Rome Treaty must also be seen 
in this light, particularly in the context of the Iraq 
prisoner abuse scandal.  At least one official in Zapatero\'s 
office readily admitted that until these elections are over, 
those who deal in foreign policy within and outside of the 
Spanish government will have to have considerable patience. 
When we raised our concern that the U.S. was being used as a 
foil in the June 13 electoral campaign, the official said 
that the visit by President Aznar to the U.S. -- still highly 
controversial here -- could be seen in a similar light. 
 
3.  (C)  Though PSOE won the March 14 election convincingly, 
if surprisingly, the party wants to dispel any notion that 
their victory was a direct result of the terrorist attacks 
and that the Spanish troop withdrawal from Iraq was a cave-in 
to Al-Qaeda.  The March 11 terrorist attacks have also become 
part of the campaign here, with PSOE seeking to show that the 
Aznar government did not read the warning signs on Islamic 
terrorism and manipulated public opinion into believing that 
the Basque terrorist group ETA had carried out the attack (in 
the belief that if the Spanish populace blamed ETA, Aznar\'s 
party would have won the elections).  The PP counters that 
the Socialists manipulated crowds and public opinion the day 
before the elections and that PSOE supporters in the police 
and elsewhere passed investigation information on to PSOE 
before it reached PP government officials.  All of this 
played into the debate on whether to convene a commission to 
investigate the terrorist attacks.  Both parties eventually 
agreed to establish such a commission, in the hope that 
information developed would discredit the other.  But the 
commission, formally established on May 26, will not hold its 
first session until after the June 13 elections. 
 
4.  (C)  PSOE has made foreign policy the key issue in the 
campaign.  Rhetoric remains particularly harsh on Iraq, the 
U.S. and Aznar.  Zapatero has remained generally above the 
fray, and has declined opportunities to criticize the U.S. on 
the Iraq abuse allegations, instead allowing the PSOE chief 
European Parliament candidate to take the lead.  Still, 
Defense Minister Bono has been very prominent in 
\"orchestrating\" the return of Spanish troops from Iraq, and 
he denied May 24 (though every interlocutor in Zapatero\'s 
office and the MFA insist to the contrary) that the 
government is considering augmenting troops in Afghanistan 
and possibly sending a presence to Haiti.  The government has 
made clear, however, that especially during the June 13 
campaign, it does not want to link the withdrawal of troops 
from Iraq with an increase in Afghanistan.  Zapatero\'s trips 
abroad, including to Morocco, France, Germany, and Mexico, 
fit into PSOE\'s desire for a large victory on June 13; each 
visit has allowed Zapatero to showcase how he and his 
government plan to differ from what they call Aznar\'s 
excessive kow-towing to the U.S. at the expense of core 
Spanish interests. 
 
5.  (C)  The PSOE and the government remain extremely anxious 
to avoid provoking public opinion even though polls show they 
are ahead some 6-10 percent.  While the PP had initially 
hoped to pull off a strong showing June 13, the party seems 
to have backed off of this idea in order to avoid 
embarrassment.  PP strategists tell us that the party regards 
defeat as likely and is focusing on keeping the margin of 
defeat as narrow as possible. 
 
6.  (C)  Though we expect the government to settle down a bit 
after the elections and ease the rhetoric, we do not expect a 
major turnaround by the Zapatero government on issues the 
Socialists feel are based on principles, Spanish consensus or 
to which they expect Spanish popular opinion to be opposed, 
in other words the vast majority of issues.  We do not expect 
a major troop increase in Afghanistan, nor a change of heart 
on the ICC resolution.  Even on the Iraq UNSC resolution, on 
which the GOS has professed to want to be helpful, we expect 
Spain to stand firm on their desire for a date certain for 
withdrawal of coalition forces (or at least a one-year 
renewal clause) and issues related to command and control of 
coalition forces. 
 
7.  (C)  One area, however, which the new Spanish government 
has not made an issue, is the U.S. presence on Spanish bases 
at Rota and Moron.  Thus far, neither the new government nor 
the PSOE has said this is a bone of contention with the U.S. 
In fact, when press reports indicated a possible reduction in 
local civilian presence at bases in Europe, including in 
Spain, the press and some government officials expressed 
concern -- probably because loss of Spanish jobs at Rota, for 
example, could harm the economy of Andalusia, a major 
Socialist regional stronghold.

SUBJECT: OPPOSITION ECONOMIC SPOKESMAN:  WE\'RE WATCHING 
CLOSELY 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  The Popular Party\'s (PP) Economic 
Spokesman in Parliament Arias told us his party is watching 
closely the development of the Socialist economic policy, 
which he characterized as a work in progress.  He described 
both sides of the political aisle in Spain as strongly in 
favor of a successful Doha Round, though he expected more 
anxiety for Spain on cotton.  Arias found the Socialist 
government\'s decision to abstain on recent biotech votes as 
encouraging, having anticipated a complete reversal of 
support on biotechnology.  Arias lamented the excellent shape 
in which the PP had left the economy, predicting the economic 
foibles of the new government wouldn\'t catch up them for at 
least two years.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  In a brief June 2 meeting, PP Economic Spokesman in 
Parliament (and former Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries) 
Miguel Arias Canetes told us he is watching the formation of 
the government\'s new economic policy closely and plans to be 
very active in his role as opposition economic spokesman.  Of 
particular concern is the budget, and how the Socialist 
government will implement its many electoral promises while 
maintaining promised fiscal discipline.  \"We\'ll be watching 
closely\" said Arias.  He encouraged us to reach out to him 
with any issues of concern regarding legislation in his 
committee. He predicted the Zapatero government would become 
less strident in its \"Europe vs. the US\" rhetoric after June 
13 European Parilament elections. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Arias described the excellent shape in which the 
Aznar government had left the economy as a gift to the 
Zapatero government.  He predicted the Socialists would have 
at least 18 months to two years of strong economic growth 
before any possible economic repercussions of new policies 
would begin to take effect.  If the economy then started 
taking a turn for the worse, he predicted the government 
would call early elections to ensure they stayed in power for 
another term. 
 
4. (U) Arias predicted that Spain would continue its \"helpful 
and supportive\" role within the EU pressing to conclude the 
Doha Development Round negotiations.  He took encouragement 
from Commissioner Lamy\'s letter supporting the elimination of 
agriculture subsidies, predicting the Spanish agriculture 
community would go along with whatever was decided without 
too much noise and difficulty.  He predicted the most serious 
area of concern for Spanish farmers would be cotton. 
 
5. (SBU) To our surprise, Arias took encouragement from the 
recent Spanish abstention votes on biotech events in EU 
bodies.  Arias had anticipated the Zapatero government would 
be ardently anti-biotech.  Arias interpreted the abstentions 
as a sign that the professional staff of the Agriculture 
Ministry was exerting an positive influence. Spanish farmers 
were very pro-biotech.   The professional staff at other 
relevant ministries -- Environment and Health -- were also 
generally pro-biotech.  If the Ministers relied on their 
staffs, he predicted the Zapatero government would continue 
to support biotech, if not as pro-actively as the Azanr 
government. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: Arias had an air of resignation about him, 
clearing getting used to his small Parliamentarian\'s office 
and new opposition role.  We found his comments on biotech to 
be encouraging, recognizing that the Spanish interagency 
process has not yet met to decide a formal stance.  The 
appointment on Friday of Jose Ignacio Arranz as the head of 
the Spanish Food Safety Agency is also an encouraging 
development.  We have worked closely with Arranz on biotech 
over the past several years and found him to be generally 
pro-biotech.

1. (C) The Spanish political scene is now focused on the June 
13 European Parliamentary elections.  Because of EU 
enlargement, Spain will elect 54 members, down from the 64 
seats it received in 1999.  With the EU elections coming only 
three months after the surprising March general elections, 
the two main parties have been in almost continuous campaign 
mode this year.  The Socialist Party (PSOE) is looking for a 
win that will reaffirm its March 14 showing and, in their 
opinion, demonstrate that its victory was not just a reaction 
to the March 11 terrorist attacks.  The Popular Party (PP) is 
striving to redeem itself, reinvigorate its base and position 
the party for a return to power. 
 
2. (C) Spain\'s two largest parties hold 51 of its 64 current 
European Parliamentary seats, the PP having won 27 seats in 
1999 and the PSOE capturing 24.  The United Left (Communist) 
won 4 seats, with regional and nationalist parties taking the 
remaining 9.  One seat was held by the Basque nationalist 
party, Euskal Herritarak, which was later declared illegal 
for its ties to the terrorist group ETA.  Another Basque 
party, Herritarren Zerrenda, was barred from running in this 
year\'s EU election by the Spanish Supreme Court, which ruled 
that it was the successor to Euskal Herritarak and also 
linked to ETA and the banned political party, Batasuna. 
 
------------------------------- 
The Main Candidates 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Leading the list of PSOE candidates is Josep Borrell. 
Borrell, 57, served as the Minister of Public Works and 
Transportation in the last Socialist government from 1991 to 
1996.  He was in the running to be the PSOE\'s candidate for 
President of the Government in 1998-99, until he voluntarily 
withdrew from consideration after two of his associates were 
implicated in a financial corruption controversy. 
 
4. (U) The PP\'s list is headed by Jaime Mayor Oreja, a 
53-year old agricultural engineer with a long history of 
involvement in Basque region politics and who is well known 
throughout Spain.  Mayor Oreja served as the Interior 
Minister during much of the Aznar administration.  He has 
been a candidate for president (lehendakari) of the Basque 
autonomous region on three occasions.  Polls show that while 
Mayor Oreja enjoys greater name recognition than Borrell, 
Borrell has greater support among Spanish voters. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
PSOE Themes - Return to Europe; Anti-Iraq and Bush 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (C) The Socialists have framed their campaign around the 
idea of returning Spain back to a European focus, rather than 
what they criticize as the overly pro-American policies of 
the Aznar administration.  Their campaign theme, \"We Return 
to Europe\", fits with President Zapatero\'s repeated 
statements that Spain had become too aligned with the United 
States, and that while not anti-American, the Socialists 
intend to return Spain to the core of Europe and the 
\"Europeanist\" movement. 
 
6. (C) Borrell and other PSOE leaders tout two main policy 
changes as proof of the Socialist government\'s pro-European 
focus: the return of Spanish troops from Iraq and the new 
Spanish commitment to support the proposed EU Constitution, 
including acceptance of the double-majority voting system 
(though they continue to negotiate the percentages the system 
will use). 
 
7. (C) Though members of the Socialist government frequently 
state that this new European focus is not anti-American, and 
that they intend to maintain a strong trans-Atlantic 
relationship, the PSOE campaign continues to demonize U.S. 
policies in Iraq and the PP for the Aznar government\'s 
support of American objectives.  Borrell has stated that 
terrorism and problems in the Middle East are linked to Bush 
administration policies and to the U.S.\'s \"unequivocal 
support\" of Israeli Prime Minister Sharon.  Alvaro Cuesta, a 
PSOE party secretary, accused the PP under Aznar of 
\"receiving instructions from Washington\" to disseminate \"Bush 
administration propaganda\", and that the PP is an affiliate 
of the U.S. Republican Party.  Cuesta stated that the PSOE 
will push for a Europe less dependent on the United States, 
and Borrell has said that he desires a European Union that is 
capable of intervening in global problems and can act as a 
counterweight to U.S. power.  Borrell has specifically 
criticized the PP for aligning itself with the \"least 
Europeanist\" EU members and for only viewing the EU as a 
common market. 
 
8. (C) Zapatero, however, has been able to take a more 
\"statesmanlike\" line, allowing Borrell and others to deliver 
the punches. 
 
------------------------------- 
PP - Strong in Europe 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) The Popular Party counters with allegations that the 
Socialists have surrendered Spain\'s bargaining chips in its 
headlong rush to prove its Europeanist credentials 
(especially in what the PP views as a precipitous statement 
that Spain would approve the EU Constitution) and that the 
PSOE will not defend Spanish national interests.  The PP 
chose \"With You, Strong in Europe\" as its election theme, 
proposing that they are the party who will protect Spanish 
national interests inside the EU and will forceful combat 
terrorism. 
 
10. (C) Mayor Oreja has criticized the PSOE for trying to 
convert the EU elections into a \"referendum on Iraq\" and that 
Borrell was trying to \"make Baghdad the capital of Europe\". 
The PP campaign stresses that they are looking to protect 
Spanish influence and voting power in the EU and to press for 
strong common policies to fight terrorism.  They dispute the 
PSOE\'s claim that they are \"euroskeptics\", stating that they 
have enhanced Spain\'s stature and influence in the EU, and 
frame the PSOE as making Spain subservient to France and 
Germany. 
 
11. (C) The PP also criticizes the PSOE government for bowing 
to the nationalist parties in Spain, as they claim is evident 
in the Zapatero government\'s proposal in May to have Spanish 
minority languages (Euskera, Catalan and Gallego) included as 
official languages of the EU.  They claim that a PSOE win on 
June 13 will only strengthen the nationalist movements. 
 
12. (C) After the demoralizing surprise defeat in March, 
Mayor Oreja has said that the PP needs a good showing in the 
EU elections to \"avoid the isolation of the Popular Party\", 
to \"bring back hope to 9 million plus voters\" and to avoid a 
long cycle of Socialist rule.  He has also noted in several 
speeches the fact that Borrell had to leave politics in 1999 
because of his links to corruption. 
 
---------------------- 
The Polls 
---------------------- 
 
13. (U) Surveys forecast the Socialists winning by 6 to 9 
percentage points, which would give them 25-27 seats, 
compared to 21-22 for the Popular Party.  The leading 
newspaper, El Pais, found 43% of poll respondents favoring 
the PSOE versus 37% for the PP.  The Center for Sociological 
Studies (CIS) projects the PSOE winning with a 46% to 37% 
margin.  Of interest in the surveys, 70% of respondents said 
that the Zapatero government\'s withdrawal of troops from Iraq 
would influence their vote, with 86% of those influenced 
saying they would vote for the PSOE.  Only 6% of those 
influenced said that the troop withdrawal would lead them to 
vote for the PP.  Also, though split when asked who had 
traditionally defended Spanish interests in the EU (PSOE- 
32%, PP- 31%), when asked who would defend Spanish interests 
best in the future, respondents chose the PSOE by a margin of 
41% to 15%.  On overall foreign policy, 72% stated that they 
thought this government\'s policy would be better than the 
Aznar administration\'s.

POSITIVE VOTE 
 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission J. Robert Manzanares, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Ambassador and DCM met June 8 with Spanish Foreign 
Minister Moratinos to press him not only for a yes vote on 
the UNSCR on Iraq, but a strong, positive explanation of the 
vote that also included clear support for the Iraqi Interim 
Government (IIG).  As he had said publicly to the press, 
Moratinos reaffirmed that Spain will vote in favor of the 
resolution.  When pressed on the explanation of vote, 
Moratinos said the statement would be positive.  He said he 
has been in close contact with his UN representatives in New 
York and they have clear instructions to be open and 
constructive. 
 
2.  (C) Moratinos also noted that some less-than-positive 
comments regarding the resolution from Zapatero and others in 
Madrid,s leadership were politically driven.  Though they 
had said that the resolution did not quite fulfill all of 
their requirements, in the end, said Moratinos, the vote 
would be positive.  Moratinos also said Spain wants to 
continue working closely with the U.S. and will continue to 
provide economic and political support to the IIG.  The IIG 
can count on the full support of the government of Spain, he 
added.  \"You can count on the Spanish,\" averred Moratinos. 
 
3.  (C) When DCM later discussed this issue with Zapatero,s 
national security advisor, Carles Casajuana, Casajuana said 
Spain would vote in favor of the resolution.  However, he was 
somewhat less categorical that the explanation of the vote 
would be completely positive; he said Spain wanted to mention 
its humanitarian law concerns and its desire for a 3-month 
Multinational Force reporting schedule to the Security 
Council.  DCM pressed for an unequivocally positive statement.

TAGS: PGOV, PTER, PREL, ECON, SP, MO 
SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S VISIT TO SEVILLE, SOCIALIST HEARTLAND 
 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please Protect Accordingly. 
 
Summary 
 
1.  (SBU) During the Ambassador\'s June 3 visit to Seville, 
Andalusia Region President Manuel Chaves told him that 
Spanish President Zapatero seeks \"normal, strong\" relations 
with the US despite Zapatero\'s rapid withdrawal of Spanish 
troops from Iraq.   Chaves, a long-time Socialist party 
\"boss,\" stressed that the Popular Party had lost the March 14 
general election because of Aznar\'s commitment of troops to 
Iraq, not because of the March 11 Madrid terrorist attacks. 
 Looking ahead to the June 13 EU Parliament elections, Chaves 
said that while the Socialists are favored to win, the public 
is apathetic.   A low turnout would boost the Popular Party\'s 
chances.  The Ambassador also met in Seville with Jose 
Antonio Viera, central government delegate to Andalusia. 
Viera expressed concerns that Islamist terrorists might hide 
among the 2.7 million Moroccans expected to travel through 
Andalusia in July and August.  Andalusian business leaders 
expressed high regard for Second VP and Economy Minister 
Solbes, but were worried that the Zapatero government, as a 
whole, might be bad for business.   End Summary. 
 
Reaching out to the Regions 
 
2.  (SBU) The Ambassador made a one-day visit June 3 to 
Seville, the capital of Andalusia, as part of his program of 
regular travel to Spain\'s 17 regions.   Andalusia has long 
been a Socialist stronghold, and Socialist former President 
Felipe Gonzalez hails from there.   Andalusia is Spain\'s 
largest region, both geographically and in population, with 
over 7.4 million inhabitants.   It is also one of Spain\'s 
poorest regions.   Tens of thousands of rural residents live 
on welfare payments (known as PER) targeted at seasonal 
agricultural workers.  The Socialist government distributes 
the benefits at the local level and this patronage provides 
them with a solid bloc of voters. 
 
Chaves Adamant on Iraq 
 
3.  (SBU) The Ambassador began his visit to Seville with a 
call on Socialist \"Baron,\" Manuel Chaves.   Chaves, President 
of Andalusia since 1990, won re-election to a fourth term on 
March 14 regaining an absolute majority for the Socialists in 
the regional parliament.   The Ambassador congratulated 
Chaves on his victory.   Chaves responded with a commentary 
on Iraq.  He said the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq 
was a political necessity for Zapatero.  Aznar\'s commitment 
of the troops went against the overwhelming sentiment of 
Spanish society.   The US resort to force in Iraq was a 
mistake.    Zapatero had to withdraw the troops from \"Aznar\'s 
war\" since they should never have been there in the first 
place, Chaves said. 
 
4.  (SBU) Chaves stressed to the Ambassador that Zapatero\'s 
March 14 election victory was due not to the March 11 Madrid 
terrorist train attacks, but to Aznar\'s involvement in Iraq. 
  If Aznar had not committed Spanish troops to Iraq, the PP 
would likely have won nationally on March 14.   The terrorist 
attacks drew attention to the Iraq commitment, but the 
Spanish public did not vote for Zapatero on the basis of the 
terrorist attacks, Chaves maintained.   What brought the PP 
down was Aznar\'s decision to implicate Spain in the Iraq war, 
he reiterated. 
 
5.  (SBU) Underlining that he holds the position of national 
President of the Socialist Party (PSOE), Chaves affirmed that 
the Zapatero government wants \"normal, strong\" relations with 
the US.   He noted that despite the differences on Iraq, 
Spain remains a US ally.  The transatlantic link is vital; 
indeed it is the linchpin of the world order, Chaves stated. 
 He added that both Zapatero and FM Moratinos are committed 
to forging positive relations with the US and were pleased by 
their meeting with Secretary Powell in Madrid in March. 
 
Rota and Moron 
 
6.  (SBU) The Ambassador expressed thanks for the assistance 
the USG receives from the Andalusian government for the bases 
in Rota and Moron.   Chaves raised the issue of the taxation 
of Spanish worker salaries, which the GOS instituted several 
years ago and has resulted in a substantial drop in workers\' 
take home pay.    Chaves expressed the hope that the US 
military and the GOS taxation authorities could work out \"a 
reasonable solution that is fair to the workers.\" 
 
Investor Concerns 
 
7.  (SBU) The Ambassador told Chaves he wanted to pass along 
that some business leaders he had spoken with are concerned 
about the economic outlook under the Zapatero government. 
The Ambassador noted that US companies had invested over $50 
billion in Spain in the previous five years and that investor 
confidence was key to keeping that trend going.  Chaves said 
he would pass those concerns on to VP/Economy Minister Solbes 
when they meet the next week.    Chaves stressed that the 
Zapatero government would not change the fundamental 
direction of Spain\'s recent economic policy and that there 
was no reason for businessmen to be concerned.   The 
appointment of Solbes as Economy Minister was a deliberate 
signal of the commitment of the Zapatero government to a 
responsible economic policy, Chaves said. 
 
June 13 EU Parliament Election: Turnout Key 
 
8.  (SBU) Regarding the outlook for the June 13 EU 
parliamentary election, Chaves said he was uncertain.   Voter 
interest in the EU election is low.   Turnout is likely to be 
especially low since the EU vote comes only three months 
after the intense national elections of March 14.    In 
addition, previous EU parliamentary elections had been held 
in conjunction with other Spanish elections, while this one 
is stand-alone.   Popular Party voters may be more motivated 
than PSOE voters.   The PP certainly hopes this is the case, 
and is working hard to turn its voters out.   On the positive 
side for PSOE, Chaves said, Zapatero is enjoying a honeymoon. 
  The decision to pull the troops from Iraq was highly 
popular. 
 
2.7 Million Moroccans Crossing the Strait This Summer 
 
9.  (SBU) The Ambassador also met with the central 
government\'s delegate to the Andalusia, Jose Antonio Viera. 
(One of the delegate\'s primary functions is to coordinate the 
activities of the national police and Guardia Civil in the 
region.)    Viera, who until March was Employment and 
Technology Counselor in Chaves\' pre-March 14 government, 
agreed that the June 13 EU parliament election would have 
much lower turnout than the March 14 general election.   He 
added that this was unfortunate, since EU issues directly 
affect Andalusia.   Labor costs in Andalusia have been 
relatively low by EU standards.   However, the expansion of 
the EU largely eliminates the cost advantage of Andalusian 
labor and may encourage some investors to locate in Eastern 
Europe instead.     As a result, Andalusian businessmen must 
now focus on Andalusia becoming a higher value investment 
location, not just a low labor cost location. 
 
10.  (SBU) Viera also discussed Morocco.   He noted that 
during July and August about 2.7 million Moroccans would 
drive through Spain on their way across the Strait of 
Gibraltar to spend the summer vacation with their families. 
Many come from France, Belgium or elsewhere in the EU. 
Viera expressed concerns about the ability of terrorists to 
mix among the travelers.    He said police would step up 
their presence to monitor the Moroccan travelers.   He 
commented that Spain, as Europe\'s frontier state with 
Morocco, was bearing the brunt of such travel.   Viera said 
the EU must do more to reach out to the Maghreb to fight 
organized crime, terrorism, drug running and immigrant 
smuggling.    Broadening the system for legal guest workers 
is another goal. 
 
11.  (SBU) Regarding the flow of illegal immigrants across 
the Strait of Gibraltar, Viera said that Spain\'s electronic 
monitoring system was highly effective and enabled Spanish 
police to see the entire coast.   Spain will be adding more 
air patrols to the mix in the next few months to improve 
efficiency.    This is important to cut down on the many 
immigrant deaths that occur in the crossing of the Strait, he 
said. 
 
Businessmen:  Respect for Solbes, But Still Concern 
 
12.  (SBU) The Ambassador also addressed the Andalusian 
Business Confederation.    In the lunch that followed, the 
Andalusian business leaders conveyed a cautious attitude 
toward the Zapatero government\'s economic policy and the 
potential for a loss of budget discipline.    They also 
expressed worries that, in the wake of the Spanish pullout 
from Iraq, Spanish products might face a backlash by US 
consumers.   Nonetheless, they had high regard for Economy 
Minister Solbes.   Some credited Solbes as being the one who 
started Spain on the path to economic growth when he was in 
Felipe Gonzalez\'s last cabinet in the mid 1990\'s.   The 
question, they said, is not Solbes, but whether Solbes can 
prevail over others in the Socialist government who do not 
share his philosophy. 
13.  (U) In addition to meetings, the Ambassador was 
interviewed by various regional media.   Press coverage was 
favorable.

1. (C) We met with Ambassador Jorge Fuentes, MFA Ambassador 
on Special Mission for EU Enlargement, on May 28 to discuss 
Spanish foreign policy inside the EU and the GOS\'s view on 
further enlargement.  Fuentes agreed with our assessment that 
with the EU Parliamentary elections coming so soon after the 
March general elections, the new Socialist government was 
still in campaign mode.  He said he believed that after the 
June 13 EU elections, the Socialists could begin tackling 
issues and ease up on the anti-US rhetoric.  He predicted 
that the Socialists would win a comfortable victory in the EU 
elections, but that the Popular Party (PP) could close the 
margin significantly if the PP could bring the lead Socialist 
candidate\'s past (Josep Borrell, who withdrew as a candidate 
for the Socialist presidential nomination in 1999 due to 
associates implicated in financial corruption) into the 
forefront. 
 
2. (C) When asked about the efforts of President Zapatero to 
return Spain to \"the core of Europe\" and the press accounts 
of French President Chirac offering to bring Spain into the 
French-German alliance, Fuentes replied that \"nobody enters 
the French-German alliance\".  He noted that other nations 
have been brought in briefly for specific purposes, 
mentioning Poland, Italy and the UK, but that all \"ended up 
on the street\".  He stated his opinion that Spain would have 
to look out for its own interests in the EU, but that he did 
not know if the Zapatero administration sees that yet. 
 
3. (C) Regarding the negotiations on the EU Constitution, 
Fuentes said that Spain would press to get the double 
majority requirements increased from the current 50% of 
countries and 60% of population to \"55% or so of countries 
and around 62% of population\".  He said he recognizes that 
the French would not accept the 66% of population proposal 
floated earlier by Spain and other members.  When asked about 
the Aznar administration\'s alliance with Poland inside the 
EU, Fuentes stated that the strategic alliance with Poland 
was \"artificial to begin with\", and that aside from some 
preferential agreements committed to under Aznar, the 
Zapatero administration would not have any huge bonds with 
Poland. 
 
4. (C) Fuentes is a proponent of Turkish admission to the EU 
(giving an explanation of his position in a speech to the 
Navy League here in Madrid), and he said that Spain favors 
offering EU accession talks to Turkey.  However, he said that 
the EU is not likely to make such an offer due to French and 
German objections.

Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)  Ambassador Argyros, accompanied by DCM and PolCouns, 
met June 8 with Spanish Defense Minister Jose Bono to 
reinforce NATO\'s and the USG\'s requests for Spanish support 
in augmenting ISAF and coalition operations in Afghanistan. 
As Bono\'s schedule permitted this meeting only several weeks 
after receipt of Ref A, Embassy had conveyed our points 
earlier to senior officials in Zapatero\'s office and at the 
MFA.  We understand that OSD officials also shared our views 
with the Spanish Embassy in Washington and with lower level 
Spanish MOD officials (Ref B and C).  Ambassador Argyros 
stressed to Bono the importance of a robust Spanish response, 
both for NATO and for the success of ISAF in Afghanistan. 
 
2.  (C) Bono reiterated, as Spanish officials have been 
telling us for several weeks, that no decision would be taken 
on Afghanistan increases until after the June 13 European 
Parliamentary elections, in which the Socialist party and the 
government seek a major victory in order to vindicate the 
March 14 national election results just after the Madrid 
terrorist attacks.  However, Bono said that Spain likely 
would commit transportation capabilities such as helicopters 
and an advanced medical unit.  Bono said that Spain also 
likely would augment current troop levels to same 800. 
(Comment:  We thought there was some \"fuzzy math\" here yet to 
be determined.)  Bono told the Ambassador he could not say 
any of this publicly yet, adding that the MFA had also to 
approve the increase.  He said the government would \"consult\" 
with the Spanish Parliament. 
 
3.  (C) Bono said the Spanish public and others needed to be 
reminded that Afghanistan was not \"just about Bin Laden,\" but 
about ridding the country of the Taliban and getting a handle 
on drug trafficking in the region.  He said these broader 
issues were also very important (note: we have seen recently 
in the Spanish press an apparent attempt by the GOS to lay 
the groundwork for a decision to augment Spanish troops in 
Afghanistan). 
 
4.  (C)  However, Bono repeatedly stressed that the USG, 
including Secretary Rumsfeld, must understand that any 
increase in the Spanish presence in Afghanistan would not be 
undertaken to \"make up for\" withdrawal of Spanish troops from 
Iraq.  Bono said that this was also important for the Spanish 
public.  The Ambassador underscored that the USG fully 
understood this point and was not making such a connection. 
 
 
5.  (C)  Both Bono and the Ambassador agreed on the need to 
move forward after difficult rhetoric during Spain\'s national 
election and European Parliament campaigns, US disappointment 
over Spain\'s rapid decision to withdraw its troops from Iraq 
and other irritants.  Bono posited that it might be useful 
for him to meet with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld during the 
NATO Summit in Istanbul in order to dispel the image of 
difficulties in the US-Spanish relationship and between him 
and Secretary Rumsfeld personally.  Bono stressed he was not 
necessarily asking for a meeting, but wanted us to think 
about the idea.  The Ambassador undertook to convey this 
thought to Washington. 
 
6.  (C)  At the close of the meeting, Bono raised recent 
local press reports related to a possible drawdown of Spanish 
civilian personnel at the naval base at the Rota Naval Base 
in Andalucia.  The Ambassador explained the context of the 
USG\'s global force posture review and said that no decisions 
regarding Spain or other nations had been taken yet.  Bono 
also raised several other issues related to the base, and he 
and the Ambassador agreed to remand these to lower levels to 
work out. 
 
7.  (C)  While noting he had said nothing publicly on the 
issue, Bono mentioned press reports alleging Secretary 
Rumsfeld, during his recent trip to Asia, had mentioned a 
possible continuing terrorist threat to Spain following the 
March 11 attacks.  The Ambassador said that he personally had 
read every readout of Secretary Rumsfeld\'s comments in 
Singapore, Japan and on the aircraft and he had not specified 
a threat to Madrid.  The Ambassador stressed that Rumsfeld 
had quite rightly noted the need to remain vigilant after the 
attacks in the US September 11, the Madrid bombings and the 
terrorist attacks in Istanbul and Bali. 
 
8.  (C)  Comment:  Bono is a media hound and we don\'t yet 
know how much of what he says is for the good of the GOS or 
for his own personal aggrandizement.    He readily admitted 
to the Ambassador he has much to learn as Minister of 
Defense, and has had a very short time to do so. However his 
lack of experience has not stopped him from making public 
pronouncements.  We do not know how much to expect from the 
MOD under his leadership. Our first reaction is not to 
believe anything until we see it and not to expect much until 
he has a better grounding of his portfolio.

1. (C) We delivered reftel demarche on June 10 to Enrique 
Mora, Director of the MFA\'s Office of EU Foreign Policy and 
Common Security.  On general questions regarding the EU 
Constitution, Mora said he thought the EU Constitution would 
be approved by June 25.  He said the double majority 
population figure would likely be increased to around 62%, 
not the 66% that Spain had been favoring.  He stated that he 
had not heard of any final choice being made for the 
successor to EC President Prodi. 
 
2. (C) Regarding the Middle East, Mora stated that he did not 
see a joint action plan between the US Broader Middle East 
and EU Barcelona Process efforts as being possible, due to 
funding and scheduling mechanism differences.  He said that 
the best he could foresee would be close cooperation between 
the US and EU programs in the Broader Middle East and North 
Africa to ensure that there was no duplication of efforts, 
but that a joint action plan would not be feasible.  He said 
that there was a better chance of getting a strong joint 
anti-terrorism plan than there was on development, reform and 
democracy issues.  Mora stated that regarding Iraq, funding 
had already been committed for the EU\'s Medium Term Strategy 
initiative. 
 
3. (C) On Iran, Mora said that Spain viewed the El Baradei 
report on June 1 as showing that, while there were a few 
shortcomings, the overall situation with Iran is \"improving\". 
 We stressed the USG view that Iran is continuing its 
policies of delay, deception and denial, and that Iran 
continues troubling activity in its enrichment program.  Mora 
stated that the EU views those activities with concern, but 
that there would be no change in policy until the conclusion 
of reports due in September or November.  He acknowledge that 
the human rights situation and status of democracy in Iran 
were deteriorating, but did not offer any comments or changes 
in Spain\'s or the EU\'s position. 
 
4. (C) Mora stated that Spain would favor a strong statement 
on Darfur in the UNSC.  He said that the EU had signed an 
agreement with Sudan to allow for observers and humanitarian 
assistance in the area.  He also confirmed that the European 
Neighborhood Policy would be broadened to include the South 
Caucasus.

Classified By: Economic Counselor Judy Garber for reasons 1.4 (b) and ( 
d) 
 
1. (C) An article in the June 9 issue of El Pais quotes 
Foreign Minister Moratinos as saying the GOS is reconsidering 
its USD 300 million pledge towards Iraq reconstruction.  The 
article suggests the review comes because so little has been 
used.  This statement seems to contradict Foreign Minister 
Moratinos, late April statement in Washington that Spain 
would maintain its aid commitments to Iraq. 
 
2. (C) It also seems at odds with repeated assurances by our 
contacts at MFA and the Ministry of Economy.  As recently as 
last week, Director General of International Finance in the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance Ramon Guzman Zapater confided 
to us that Vice President and Minister of Economy Pedro 
Solbes instructed him to carry out the pledges Spain made at 
the Madrid Donors\' Conference. 
 
3. (U) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of 
Economy share responsibility for Spain\'s aid pledge.  Of the 
total $300 million pledge made at the Donors, Conference, 
$100 million has already been disbursed.  Our understanding 
of the breakdown of the remaining $200 million provided by 
our contacts in the Ministry of Economy follows: 
 
4. (U) Year 2004 (some of which has been disbursed) 
Total: $ 60 million 
IRFFI: $ 20 million (Min. Econ) 
IFC Small Business Facility: $ 5 million (Min. Econ) 
Production of Iraqi Dinars: $18 million (Min. Econ) 
Not programmed: $ 17 million (Min. Econ and MFA) 
 
5. (U) Years 2005-2007 (Note: this allocation is notional and 
will likely change) 
Total: $ 140 million 
Ministry of Economy non-reimbursable credit lines (FAD): $75 
million 
Bilateral donations (MFA*Spanish Agency for International 
Development):  $ 55 
Nonspecific technical assistance: $ 10 million (Min. Econ and 
MFA) 
 
6. (C) Comment: Given repeated assurances by our contacts 
that the previous government\'s commitments at the 
International Donors\' Conference for Iraq would be carried 
out, Moratinos\' statements in El Pais, if accurate, come as a 
surprise.  It is unclear whether Moratinos was referring to 
MFA assistance funding only or the entire $200 million 
commitment.  His comments may also be part of a pattern of 
sometimes contradictory statements by ministers as the 
Zapatero government tries to create cohesive policies.  We 
will continue to emphasize our expectations that Spain 
fulfill all of its Madrid Conference pledges.

1. (U) The Socialist Party (PSOE) won Spain\'s EU 
Parliamentary elections on June 13, but by a smaller margin 
than expected, 43% to 41%.  The two-point difference offers 
something positive to both major parties, though the Popular 
Party probably comes away with the moral victory.  The 
Socialists will have 25 seats and the Popular Party 23. 
Minor parties will have a total of 6 seats. 
 
2. (SBU) The Socialists will use even this narrow win to 
reaffirm their victory in the March 14 general elections and 
to try to demonstrate that their capture of the government 
was not just a result of the March 11 terrorist attacks in 
Madrid.  Socialists also see a positive sign in that they won 
despite a record low voter turnout (which at 46% was the 
lowest voter participation in any election since the 
restoration of democracy in Spain in 1977, hindered yesterday

the night before) and marked the first time the Socialists 
have won an election that had less than 55% participation. 
Though not the ringing endorsement the PSOE had hoped for a 
few weeks ago, they definitely welcome the win. 
 
3. (SBU) The Popular Party sees the close loss as a sign that 
their party is on the way back and that they have weathered 
the fallout from the Aznar government\'s support for the Iraq 
war.  Polls released before the election had forecast the 
Socialists winning by 6 to 9 percent, building upon the 
PSOE\'s 5-point win in the general elections.  The Popular 
Party succeeded in reversing the trend and shaved the 
Socialist margin by more than half.  The hope among the 
Popular Party is that this is proof that the Iraq issue is on 
its last legs, and that once the political focus returns to 
issues such as the economy, terrorism and the growing 
nationalist movements, the Popular Party is well poised to 
regain power. 
 
4. (C) Comment: With this election behind them, the ruling 
Socialists have the opportunity to get out of campaign mode, 
which was heavy on anti-U.S. policy rhetoric.  Since coming 
into power, the Socialists have been trying to contrast 
themselves from what they describe as the overly pro-U.S. 
policies of the Aznar government.  This anti-U.S. bent even 
affected such issues as Spain\'s representation at the funeral 
services for President Reagan.  A contact at MFA told us that 
the government had to send the President of the Senate, 
Javier Rojo, \"kicking and screaming\" as Spain\'s 
representative because none of the higher-ranking Socialist 
officials in the Zapatero government wanted to attend.

CAMPAIGN CENTERED ON IRAQ, US TIES 
 
 
Classified By: Polcouns Kathleen Fitzpatrick, per 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
Summary 
 
1.  (C) Jose Maria Aznar did not participate in the Popular 
Party\'s campaign for the June 13 EU parliamentary election. 
With the Socialists making the war in Iraq and distancing 
Spanish foreign policy from the US their central campaign 
issues, Popular Party leaders decided that Aznar was too 
radioactive to help in the campaign.   Aznar insiders tell us 
that Aznar recognized this as well, but is confident time 
will ultimately vindicate his policies.  Many in the PP 
regarded Aznar\'s May visit to the US, which included a 
private meeting with President Bush, as inopportune.   They 
believe the visit give the Socialists ammunition in their 
efforts to portray the PP as a tool of the US.  Following his 
US visit, Aznar avoided the media and focused on presiding 
over the PP think tank (FAES) and learning English in 
preparation for speaking engagements.  On June 13, the 
Popular Party succeeded in beating expectations and came 
within two points of the Socialists in the EU election.  End 
Summary. 
 
Aznar Radioactive 
 
2.  (C) Aznar\'s longtime associate and former State Secretary 
for Communication Alfredo Timmermans told us recently that 
Aznar\'s decision to play no public role in the June 13 EU 
parliament election campaign was his choice, but that it also 
reflected the preference of PP leaders.   The Socialists 
(PSOE) sought a repeat of their March 14 surprise election 
victory and played up themes that had worked for them, 
notably opposition to the Iraq war and Aznar\'s close 
relations with the US.    Timmermans said that Aznar was 
fully aware that he was politically radioactive and, as a 
result, kept a low profile.  His only public activities were 
to appear at signings of new his book recounting his years in 
office.   (Timmermans noted sales are going well and the book 
is now in its second printing.) 
 
\"Photo of the Azores\" 
 
3.  (C)  A Socialist refrain from the EU parliament election 
campaign was the need to correct \"the photo of the Azores.\" 
To them, the March 2003 Azores summit stands for committing 
Spain to an Iraq conflict that the Spanish public wanted no 
part of and for allying with the US instead of France and 
Germany. 
 
4.  (C)  For this reason, there was unease in the PP when 
Aznar visited the US in May 2004, only weeks after stepping 
down from office.   While PP leaders stated that Aznar had a 
right to travel where he wished, many, including Aznar 
loyalists, felt that given the EU election Aznar should have 
postponed the trip until after June 13.   Timmermans told us 
that many in the PP wanted Aznar to \"stay home and say 
nothing.\"    Timmermans said Aznar understood that he is, for 
the present, a divisive figure but that he is confident time 
will vindicate his policies toward Iraq and the US. 
Timmermans said Aznar was buoyed by the warm reception he 
received in the US and, in particular, by his meeting with 
President Bush.   Timmermans contrasted this warmth with the 
reticence Aznar has encountered from some in the Popular 
Party since March 14. 
 
Aznar\'s Messages to the US 
 
5.  (C) Timmermans noted that Aznar had expressed concern to 
President Bush that the March 11 Madrid terrorist attacks had 
sent a message to terrorists that they can influence 
elections.   Aznar urged vigilance in advance of US 
elections.   Aznar believes al Qaeda inspired terrorists 
might also target countries like Italy where public opinion 
is vulnerable.     Timmermans said Aznar believes the US has 
to brace for continued bad news from Iraq and came away with 
the impression that some US observers may be too optimistic 
about the medium term outlook.  Timmermans said an election 
defeat by President Bush in November would be read, rightly 
or wrongly, in Spain as a defeat for the Popular Party and 
would give the Socialists a boost. 
 
6.  (C) Timmermans said the PP, Aznar included, continues to 
be \"astonished\" by the chain of events from the March 11 
terrorist attacks to surprise election defeat on March 14. 
Many Popular Party members, Timmermans said, blame Aznar\'s 
Iraq policy for the defeat and believe Aznar gambled with the 
party\'s future on Iraq and lost.    Like other Spaniards (80 
percent according to some polls), most PP members were not 
sorry to see the Spanish troops come home, Timmermans said. 
 
7.  (C) Timmermans underlined that Aznar remains unyielding 
in his beliefs.  Aznar will continue to support the Iraq war 
and say publicly that the Madrid terrorist attacks on March 
11 brought the Socialists to power.   Timmermans (speaking 
before June 13) noted that President Zapatero is still in the 
honeymoon phase and thus the PSOE would have an important 
electoral advantage.    Zapatero has not had to make any 
unpopular decisions and his one major decision ) to pull the 
troops out ) was highly popular.   Timmermans said that all 
of Zapatero\'s decisions are taken with one idea in mind: 
doing what is popular. 
 
Aznar\'s Future 
 
8.  (C) Aznar is confident that in the longer term, he will 
be vindicated, Timmermans said.   However, the current period 
is a difficult one for the PP and for Aznar personally.    In 
the coming year, Aznar intends to travel frequently to the 
US.   While based in Spain, he will make speeches to US 
audiences and teach occasional seminars at Georgetown. 
Aznar is working hard on his English and is presiding over 
the Popular Party think tank, FAES.    Timmermans said Aznar 
will make it a point to speak out in favor of the 
transatlantic link and the need for close relations with the 
United States. 
 
June 13:  PP Exceeds Expectations, On Road to Recovery 
 
9.  (C) Popular Party strategists told us in the run up to 
the June 13 election that the PP goal was to keep the race 
close.   None said that they expected to win, but they did 
hope to cut the Socialist margin.   Polling had given the 
Socialists a 6 to 9 point advantage.   The June 13 result was 
far tighter: the Socialists won by only two points.   PP 
leaders regard this as a relative victory.   Jorge Moragas, 
PP Director for International Affairs, told us that the 
result at least succeeded in giving a \"shock\" to the 
over-confidence of the Socialists and is a signal the PP is 
on the road to recovery.

PARTICIPATION 
 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires J. Robert Manzanares, reasons 1.4(b) a 
nd (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Spanish Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardino 
Leon apologized to Charge June 14 on behalf of the Spanish 
government for negative remarks the Spanish first vice 
president made about Secretary Rumsfeld June 4.  Leon also 
confirmed Spain will increase its participation in 
Afghanistan by providing \"tactical assistance\" and by 
increasing its troop presence.  Leon additionally said that 
if the U.S. needs the GOS to vote in favor of ICC rollover to 
prevail on the resolution, the GOS would do so.  Finally, 
Leon said Spain does not plan to backtrack on its Iraq 
Donors\' Conference commitments, only to reassess priorities 
for spending the money.  End summary. 
 
---------------- 
Official Apology 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C) Leon requested the meeting with Charge in order to 
apologize for remarks First Vice President de la Vega made 
about Secretary Rumsfeld June 4.  In response to incorrect 
reports June 4 that Secretary Rumsfeld had said in Singapore 
that Spain was among the countries terrorists might target 
over the summer, de la Vega said Rumsfeld\'s supposed remarks 
were \"imprudent and irresponsible.\"  Leon said he was 
apologizing \"officially on behalf of the government of Spain\" 
for de la Vega\'s \"inappropriate remarks,\" which were based on 
an incorrect report by the official Spanish news agency EFE. 
Leon added the government was asking EFE to begin an 
investigation of how the inaccuracies occurred.  He asked 
Charge to transmit the apology to the State Department and to 
Secretary Rumsfeld. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
3.  (C) Charge replied that he would do so and had no plans 
to make the apology public, but asked Leon to work to curb 
the anti-American comments being made by members of the 
Zapatero government, which were simply unconstructive.  Leon 
said the Zapatero government is not anti-American and 
attributed some of the more intemperate comments to 
electioneering.  Charge observed the elections were now over 
and it was time for Spain to show with concrete examples that 
it wants to cooperate with the U.S. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Spain to Up Afghanistan Participation 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Leon said Spain was already showing it means to have 
strong relations with the U.S. and pointed to Afghanistan. 
He was happy to report that the Council of Ministers June 11 
approved sending helicopters, transport planes and a hospital 
unit to Afghanistan.  Also, Spain was sending additional 
troops to Afghanistan as part of the Eurocorps deployment, 
and would send a battalion to further augment its presence 
sometime in the future.  He was not certain about specific 
numbers, deferring to the Defense Ministry. 
 
5.  (C) Leon did not know precisely when the GOS would make 
this decision public but promised to provide the Charge with 
a statement or other information the USG could make public in 
the next several days.  He also said the GOS had not yet made 
a decision on whether to participate in a provincial 
reconstruction team. 
 
------------------------------- 
A Spaniard as UN Envoy to Iraq? 
------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Leon then suggested to Charge that one way for Spain 
to show it was maintaining its commitment to Iraq and had 
patched things up with the U.S. would be for the next UN 
special representative for Iraq to be a Spaniard.  The GOS, 
in fact, already has someone picked out, according to Leon: 
Spain\'s Consul General in Washington.  Leon said the diplomat 
is well and favorably known to the U.S. and is also an 
Arabist.  Charge said he did not know how the USG would react 
to Leon\'s suggestion but would transmit it to Washington. 
 
7.  (C) Charge mentioned that recent remarks by Foreign 
Minister Moratinos suggesting Spain was \"re-examining\" its 
financial commitments made at the Iraq Donors\' Conference 
would not help a Spanish candidate for the UN position.  Leon 
said he was prepared to say \"officially\" that Spain \"was not 
re-examining its commitments.\"  Rather, Spain was taking 
another look at priorities for spending the money it has 
committed.  Spain would not back away from the commitments it 
made in Madrid last October, said Leon. 
 
------------------------------------ 
ICC Rollover: We\'ll Be There for You 
------------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) Charge then reminded Leon that in previous 
consultations on the ICC rollover resolution in the UNSC, 
Spain had told the U.S. that it would abstain on the 
resolution unless the U.S. needed Spain\'s vote for the 
resolution to pass.  Charge told Leon that we now need 
Spain\'s vote to win and hoped they would follow through on 
their promise.  Leon said if the U.S. needs Spain\'s vote for 
the resolution to pass, \"we\'ll be there for you.\"  And there 
would be no need for Secretary Powell to call Foreign 
Minister Moratinos again on the issue. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) Leon\'s apology for de la Vega\'s remarks was welcome 
but his comments on Afghanistan, Iraq and the ICC were more 
important.  Leon\'s statement that the GOS has made the 
decision to augment its presence in Afghanistan was 
encouraging.  When and how Spain will do this, of course, 
remains to be seen.  On Iraq, while Leon\'s suggestion that a 
Spaniard might be appropriate as the next UN envoy to Iraq 
seemed a bit off the mark, his confirmation that Spain did 
not plan to \"re-examine\" its financial commitments made to 
Iraq at the Madrid Donors\' Conference was also positive, if 
that proves to be the case.  Finally, Spain has said it \"will 
be there\" for us on the ICC rollover if we need them.  The 
Zapatero government will have to fulfill its commitment to 
the U.S. on this issue or blatantly fail to keep its word.

curtains,\" Llorens said. 
 
4.  (SBU) Llorens explained that some in Brussels believe 
that any bilateral negotiations reduce incentives for the US 
to negotiate with the EC.  Llorens agreed that entering into 
a fairly typical bilateral agreement should not reduce the 
EC\'s negotiating power, noting that Spain and its air 
business is not the impetus behind US-EU negotiations.  Yet 
she was uncertain how Brussels would ultimately respond to 
Spain\'s notification. 
 
5.  (SBU) Llorens does not know when Spain will submit the 
notice.  However, she believes that late September would be 
an ideal time to negotiate and reach agreement, since August 
should be avoided for Spanish vacation reasons, and she would 
like to complete the bilateral before the US presidential 
elections in November. 
 
6.  (SBU) She expects the negotiations to be very brief.  She 
said that the US negotiators know what Spain wants, and the 
GOS knows what the US wants.  She noted that there might be 
some discussion about 7th freedom rights, and possibly one 
other issue.  She considers any upcoming negotiation to be 
fairly straightforward. 
 
7.  (SBU) Comment:  Llorens mentioned several times that she 
was only expressing her thoughts and plans.  However, her 
comments track with past GOS comments that should US-EU 
negotiations fail, Spain would seek a bilateral.  While she 
believes that Minister Alvarez supports her position, she 
cannot be certain that Alvarez will initiate bilateral 
negotiations.  End Comment.

REF: A) MADRID 2230 B) MADRID 2204 C) MADRID 2012 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  In a June 14 meeting with Charge, Spanish 
Secretary of State for Economy David Vegara said the fight 
 
SIPDIS 
against terrorism finance, including close cooperation with 
the United States, would continue to be a priority for the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance.  On Iraq reconstruction, the 
senior Spanish Economy Ministry official reiterated that 
Spain will honor the commitments made at the October 2003 
Madrid Donors\' Conference, forecasting the $5 million 
contribution to the International Finance Corporation Small 
Business Facility and $20 million to the IRFFI would be 
deposited this week or next.  Vegara described stimulating 
productivity, respect for market mechanisms and fiscal 
stability as the pillars of the Spanish Socialist Party 
(PSOE) economic program.  He downplayed media speculation on 
the seriousness of the PSOE\'s commitment to economic reforms, 
recognizing the government needed to earn the trust of 
Spain\'s major economic players.  Vegara said he hoped to meet 
with Treasury officials when next in Washington, at a minimum 
on the margins of the annual IMF/WB meetings.  End Summary. 
 
Terrorism Finance:  Toward the Top of the Agenda 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (SBU) In a June 14 courtesy call with Charge, Vegara 
emphatically underscored the importance of the fight against 
terrorism finance to the Ministry of Economy\'s agenda. 
Vegara demurred that he was still reading in on the subject, 
but appreciated the GOS\' work in FATF and that Spain would 
continue to play an active role on these issues, including 
close cooperation with the U.S.   Vegara took note of the 
Charge\'s urging that the Ministry of Economy press for rapid 
approval of implementing regulations for last year\'s 
terrorism finance law.  He noted he would be attending his 
first meeting of the newly created Terrorism Finance 
Oversight Committee next week and would raise the regulations 
if not already on the agenda.  Vegara said he would welcome 
U.S. views on any other terrorism finance-related issues 
where we felt additional action was needed. 
 
Iraq:  Honor Our Commitments 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) Charge recounted to Vegara Vice President Solbes\' 
commitment to Ambassador that Spain would honor the 
assistance pledges made at the October 2003 Madrid Donors\' 
Conference.  He noted our initial concern regarding recent 
remarks by FM Moratinos as reported in El Pais (ref B), which 
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Bernadino Leon later 
 
SIPDIS 
clarified that Mortinos intended to review how money was 
being spent not whether it would be contributed (ref A). 
Vegara reitered that Spain would honor its commitments.  He 
noted his intention to complete the processing for the 
deposit of $5 million for the IFC Small Business Facility and 
$20 million to the IRFFI this week or next.  He needed to 
consult with the MFA before final approval but anticipated he 
would not encounter any problems. 
 
Improving Productivity and Keeping the Budget Balanced 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4.  (U) Vegara provided a brief overview of the Zapatero 
government\'s economic vision, stating that the GOS was 
commited to change the growth model to a greater focus on 
improving productivity.  For instance, labor reform needed to 
ensure wage increases reflected increases in productivity. 
Fiscal disipline also formed a critical pillar of the PSOE\'s 
economic policy.  Vegara credited the Aznar government with 
creating a wide base of public support for sound fiscal 
policies.  PSOE intended to maintain that support, as shown 
by VP Solbes\' presentation of next year\'s broad budget 
framework establishing expediture limits in line with fiscal 
balance.  Vegara also underscored the Zapatero\'s government\'s 
respect for markets, promising the Socialist government had 
no intention of interfering in private sector business 
decisions.   Vegara said he understood the Zapatero 
government would need to earn the private sector -- and 
American investors\' --  trust, but also noted the government 
should be allowed time to establish its reputation.  He 
offered his doors were open if the Embassy needed 
clarification or coordination on specific issues raised by 
U.S.investors or other policy concerns. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Clearly still getting a handle on his job, Vegara 
came across as committed to sound economic policies and 
willing to work with us on terrorism finance as well as other 
issues.  In our conversation, Vegara mentioned his interest 
in meeting with his counterparts when next in DC.  We 
anticipate Vegara will attend the IMF/WB meetings this fall 
and recommend Washington agree to appropriate bilaterals if 
schedules permit. 
 
Bio Note 
-------- 
 
6. (U) A 40-year old economist from Catalunya, Vegara spent 
junior high school in Palo Alto and studied at the London 
School of Economics.  He worked at the Sabadell Bank after 
getting his degree, joining Prime Minister Gonzalez\' economic 
staff at Moncloa (the Spanish White House) in the latter 
years of the Gonzalez government.  After PP gained power in 
1996, Vegara worked with Miguel Sebastian (now PM Zapatero\'s 
economic advisor) at Intermoney, a Spanish economic 
consultancy.  Following the Catalan Socialist Party victory 
earlier this year, he briefly joined the Catalan government, 
before being asked by PM Zapatero to serve as Secretary of 
State for Economic Affiars.  Vegara speaks fluent English.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, SP 
SUBJECT: ECONOMISTS OFFER MIXED OUTLOOK ON GOS ECONOMIC 
REFORMS 
 
 1. Summary: In a breakfast with the Ambassador, leading 
Spanish economists offered mixed views on the ability of Vice 
President and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes to 
hold the line on sound economic policies in a heavily 
political cabinet.  The economists cited as major policy 
challenges for the new government: reining in the budgets of 
the autonomous regions; reducing high housing costs without 
producing a collapse in the booming real estate sector; and 
carrying out labor reform to increase the productivity of the 
Spanish economy.  The economists presented a healthy 
skepticism of the Socialist government\'s ability to seriously 
address these economic challenges.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Solbes and the Economic Team v. the Government 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. On June 9, Ambassador Argyros hosted a breakfast for 
Spanish economists.  The guests seemed to empathize with Vice 
President and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes\' 
unenviable position.   The recently elected Socialist 
government ran a campaign calling for increases in education, 
R&D, the minimum wage, and transfer payments, while promoting 
a flat income tax and maintaining responsible fiscal 
policies.  Some of these proposals, such as increased 
education spending and tax changes were modified, as the 
reality of the costs associated with implementing them proved 
difficult in light of the government\'s promise to maintain 
fiscal restraint. 
 
3.  The economists offered only praise for Solbes\' \"economic 
dream team\".  They noted that this team-up was no accident. 
Socialist leaders realize that the Popular Party (PP) 
government handled the economy well, and that the PP did not 
lose the election on economic issues.  Therefore, Vice 
President Solbes intends to maintain the fiscal balance he 
inherited from the previous government as long as possible. 
The main challenge will be what one economist described as a 
slow bleeding effect on the budget.  Socialist ministers will 
propose spending increases that are opposed by the economic 
team.  The resulting compromises between the spenders and the 
budget guardians will yield a small increase in minimum wage 
here or a new social benefit there.  The cumulative changes 
could derail the government\'s good reform intentions as 
aggregate spending slowly rises.  The economists emphasized 
that Solbes and his team will need to remain vigilant. 
 
4. The group agreed the Vice President needed Zapatero\'s 
political support to succeed.  One economist stated, \"it 
wasn\'t Rato who held the line on the Popular Party\'s 
budget--President Aznar inquired about the bottom line every 
day.\"  However, no one knows what Zapatero really thinks 
about economic policy.  Our guests noted a recent Zapatero 
statement contradicting Vice President Solbes, claim that 
the capital gains tax would not be raised by the Socialist 
government.  They applauded Solbes\' tough talk, but predicted 
that without Moncloa\'s (the Spanish White House) support, the 
economic team would have a difficult time resisting demands 
of ministers who carry more political weight in the cabinet. 
 
----------------------------- 
Center-Regional Budget Issues 
----------------------------- 
 
5. The group noted another challenge for the economic team 
will be reigning in the current deficit spending by some of 
Spain\'s autonomous regions.  Some regional governments have 
called for greater budgeting power to augment increasing 
political powers.  In light of Solbes\' possible 
reconsideration of the 2001 Balanced Budget Law, which 
constrains regional budgets, the economists noted that some 
regional leaders, such as Catalonia\'s Pascual Maragall, may 
make budget negotiations with the regions very difficult. 
 
------- 
Housing 
------- 
 
6. The economists expected a soft landing for housing prices 
unless interest rates rise by more than 2%-3%; due to 
economic weakness in Germany, they do not expect this to 
happen.  Such a change could lead to economic displacement, 
but an economist from one of the largest banks noted that 
Spain\'s banks would adjust mortgage terms if necessary to 
prevent widespread loan defaults.  Another guest noted that a 
negative change in the housing market would harm heavily 
invested developers far more than the average home owner; 
however, a drop in consumer spending and a slow-down in the 
construction industry could cause a negative wealth effect in 
the economy. 
 
----------------------------- 
Labor Reform and Productivity 
----------------------------- 
 
7. The economists mentioned labor reform as one of the most 
anticipated changes by the new government to increase 
productivity in Spain.  The group agreed that high labor 
rigidity and inflexibility are major problems.  However, no 
one has been able to divine what the government actually 
plans to do.  Some union leaders are close to President 
Zapatero, but no one could predict whether this will 
facilitate or complicate necessary reforms. 
 
8. One guest posited a litmus test for commitment to reform: 
the debate over commercial and retail regulation.  Minister 
of Industry Montilla is proposing a reduction in retail 
hours.  Solbes has been pushing to keep the current liberal 
regime.  This is only one aspect of a deeper question:  Will 
national policies be put in place to stop the encroachment of 
large wholesale retailers?  Currently in Catalonia 
(Montilla\'s native region), local regulation requires large 
retailers to submit a business plan before developing a piece 
of property.  This level of regulation makes it virtually 
impossible for large international retailers to enter the 
local market.  It will be telling to see how this plays out. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Spain Still Good for U.S. Business 
---------------------------------- 
 
9. We noted concerns raised by some U.S. businesses that 
Socialist policies combined with anti-American election 
rhetoric could deter U.S. investment.  The economists 
downplayed these fears, noting that Spain is still open for 
business.  They agreed that Spain is and will remain a good 
place to invest and do business for U.S. companies. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. In the first few months of the new Socialist government, 
few predictions can be made about the government\'s commitment 
to carrying out economic reforms or dealing with economic 
challenges.  Our group of economists expressed uncertainty at 
Vice President Solbes, ability to maintain fiscal discipline 
without the full support of President Zapatero--still an 
unknown.  The discussion led to a considerable list of 
concerns and worries about the government\'s (beyond the 
economic team) commitment to manage economic reforms. 
Whether the issue is maintaining balanced budgets, housing or 
labor reform, the economists presented a scrambled picture.

FERNANDEZ 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ASEC 
SUBJECT: CLARIFICATION ON NEWS STORY REGARDING SECRET 
SERVICE INCIDENT WHILE ON JENNA BUSH PROTECTIVE DETAIL IN 
SOUTHERN SPAIN 
 
1.  News articles have just been released relating to an 
incident that occurred in the southern town of Tarifa, Spain, 
on June 10, at 1630 hours, between several organized crime 
street criminals and two Secret Service Agents who were 
working a protective detail on President Bush\'s daughter 
Jenna.  The facts have been misrepresented in the local press 
and the following are the correct salient details regarding 
the incident. 
 
2.  While USSS Agents were attempting to keep their 
appropriately remote but responsive distance from the 
vacationing Ms. Bush, a couple of them took up a vantage 
point at a sidewalk cafe.  One Agent\'s cell phone was on the 
table when three thugs in their early twenties sauntered by 
and picked up his phone and began to walk away assuming that 
they were impressively intimidating enough to prevent the 
Agent from coming after his phone.  It was later learned that 
these youth were part of an organized gang that demanded 
protection money from local vendors and ruled the small area 
with fear.  The Secret Service Agent immediately went after 
his necessary means of communication.  The three youth faced 
him down and challenged his demand for his cell phone.  A 
scuffle ensued which led to the two USSS Agents demonstrating 
their superior resolve and capability, the recovery of the 
cell phone, and a bloody nose and lip for the leader of the 
pack.  In addition, one of the gang members was thrown into 
the side of a car and crumpled the metal.  At one point, one 
Agent\'s weapon holster came unsnapped and the handgun fell 
onto the street.  The Agent quickly recovered it and 
re-snapped it in his holster.  The handgun was never pointed 
at anyone nor used to intimidate.  The police were called. 
The gang returned shortly thereafter with a fourth member and 
hand-made batons.  The two USSS Agents were still present and 
before the next scuffle could evolve, the police arrived and 
arrested the youth gang. 
 
3.  As is customary, the police wanted to take the USSS 
Agents in for questioning as well, but Ms. Bush, who was 
completely unaware that anything had occurred, was beginning 
to change locations and the Agents needed to continue their 
work.  The RSO office had provided an FSNI, Juan Diaz, to act 
as liaison on this detail and moments like this are when a 
great FSNI really pays off.  Juan used his previous police 
experience and contacts to convince the police to deal with 
the gang members only and to allow the Agents to go about 
their job.  Those police will be properly thanked by the RSO 
office.  As the USSS Agents began to leave, vendors from the 
area and some general public came up to them to offer their 
appreciation and thanks for standing up against this group 
who had been terrorizing them. 
 
4.  It was impractical for the Agents to stay and press 
charges against the gang since they would not be in Spain two 
months later for the court hearing.  However, the man who 
owned the car with the crushed side did file a police 
complaint against the thugs.  In summary, first, Jenna Bush 
was completely uninvolved and unaware that it even occurred 
until later.  Second, all Agents acted professionally and 
with restraint and deserve congratulations.  Third, the gun 
was never drawn against anyone including the criminals 
because the situation did not call for it.  It was 
unfortunate that the gang chose the wrong person to steal 
from but it was in no way instigated or amplified by the USSS 
Agents.  There are several versions to this incident in 
different papers all looking to make their dramatic mark but 
these are the facts.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2014 
TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, SP 
SUBJECT: LABOR LEADER SKEPTICAL ON ZAPATERO 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen Fitzpatrick per 1.4 (b) and 
 (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Pol/Labor officer spoke June 16 with Jose Maria 
Fidalgo, Secretary General of Spain\'s largest trade union 
confederation, CCOO (Comisiones Obreras).  Fidalgo expressed 
a cautious, wait-and-see attitude toward the Zapatero 
government.  He said he was not yet convinced of Zapatero\'s 
seriousness.  Zapatero has made many promises on such issues 
as shifting more workers from part time contracts to full 
time employment.  However, his government has not yet taken 
any concrete steps to deal with the problem.   On this and 
other matters, there is the need to move from talk to action, 
Fidalgo said.   He noted he had maintained cordial relations 
with Aznar, but the relationship had become strained in the 
final Aznar years.  (He attributed this to Aznar becoming 
more arrogant and isolated in his second term.) 
 
2.  (C)  Fidalgo criticized both Zapatero and, in particular, 
Labor and Social Affairs Minister Jesus Caldera, for not 
knowing how to govern.   He said they are acting as if they 
were still in the opposition or still campaigning.   They 
don\'t know how to manage; all they seem to know how to do is 
give speeches.   This, he observed, contrasts with the 
Popular Party, which still acts like it is governing and does 
not know how to act in opposition.   Fidalgo attributed the 
confusion on both sides to the fact that neither the PP nor 
the PSOE thought the PSOE would win the March 14 elections. 
As a result, neither leadership is prepared for the roles 
they now occupy.   (Fidalgo commented that there was no doubt 
in his mind that the March 11 Madrid terror attacks had 
thrown the election to the PSOE.  He said that when people 
are frightened and confused, they opt for the easy solution, 
and that is what the PSOE offered.) 
 
3.  (SBU)  Fidalgo told us that the CCOO Director for 
International Affairs, Javier Doz, had recently met AFL-CIO 
President Sweeney in Geneva.   (Note: We invited Doz to 
participate in an International Visitors program this fall 
and he has accepted.)  Fidalgo said the CCOO would like to 
expand its contacts with the AFL-CIO, which, he said, had 
previously kept the CCOO at arms length.   Fidalgo commented 
that the CCOO had added over 200,000 new members in the past 
five years and that its position and finances were solid. 
He noted that the unions had demonstrated their strength in 
June 2002 when they convoked a general strike and compelled 
the Aznar government to back off on measures that would have 
established tight controls on unemployment benefits. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Precarious (temporary contact) employment is 
Spain\'s number one labor challenge, Fidalgo stated. 
Thirty-one percent of employees are on temporary contracts, a 
figure well above the EU average.   Fidalgo said one of the 
problems in making the temporary jobs permanent is their low 
skill, low productivity nature.   The GOS will have to 
encourage business to invest more in these workers to raise 
their productivity.  Fidalgo said he is pressing the Zapatero 
government to adopt a program of regular consultations with 
the unions; he believes Zapatero will agree. 
 
5.  (C)  Comment: While CCOO\'s origins are on the left (it 
was originally linked with Spain\'s communist party) it has 
adopted an increasingly pragmatic posture in recent years 
under Fidalgo\'s leadership.  Fidalgo made a point of 
stressing to us his previous good relations with the Aznar 
government, his skepticism about Zapatero\'s ability to 
deliver on his promises, and his desire for improved ties 
with the AFL-CIO.   He did not mention Iraq.   While the 
other main national labor federation, UGT, is nominally 
independent, in reality its leaders are all Socialists.   It 
was notable that Fidalgo expressed no sense of relief that a 
government of the left was in power.   Indeed, he was often 
rolling his eyes as he discussed Zapatero.   On foreign 
policy, the CCOO, while highly critical of US policy in Iraq, 
has been more moderate than the UGT.    CCOO International 
Affairs Director Doz told us he agreed the war in Afghanistan 
was necessary.   The UGT, by contrast, vehemently opposed US 
action in both Afghanistan and Iraq.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/23/2014 
TAGS: MARR, PREL, PGOV, SP, Defense and Political 
SUBJECT: BLOOMFIELD DELEGATION UPDATES SPANISH ON GLOBAL 
DEFENSE POSTURE REVIEW PLANS 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission J. Robert Manzanares, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Assistant Secretary of State for 
Political-Military Affairs Lincoln Bloomfield and Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy Andrew Hoehn 
briefed GOS officials June 15 on the latest USG thinking on 
the global defense posture review (GDPR) and its possible 
impact on Spain.  Bloomfield and Hoehn said the USG was not 
likely to consolidate NAVEUR and the Sixth Fleet at Rota 
Naval Air Station.  Due to cost and efficiency 
considerations, the U.S. was considering alternatives to 
Spain for the consolidation.  Hoehn added that at this time 
the USG was not contemplating significant reductions in 
personnel at either Rota or Moron Air Base as a result of 
GDPR.  The Spanish appreciated the briefing and emphasized 
the base relationship was very important to Spain.  The GOS 
sought more detailed information on GDPR and Bloomfield said 
a member of the U.S. delegation could return to brief further 
once the delegation had apprised other affected countries of 
the latest U.S. plans.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) The Bloomfield delegation met at the Foreign Ministry 
in a single meeting with the Foreign Ministry\'s political 
director, Rafael Dezcallar, the Defense Ministry\'s director 
general for policy, Gen. Felix Sanz, and the Presidency\'s 
Maria Jesus Alonso (no. 2 to NSA Casajuana).  Bloomfield 
briefed the Spanish on general GDPR concepts and explained 
that the foundation for the global review was the political 
dimension.  He added he was following up on Under Secretary 
of Defense for Policy Doug Feith\'s visit to Spain in December 
2003.  Recalling that Feith had suggested the U.S. might 
consolidate NAVEUR and the Sixth Fleet at Rota, Hoehn said 
the U.S. appreciated Spain\'s positive response to the idea 
but said cost and efficiency reasons were now causing the 
U.S. to examine alternatives to Rota for NAVEUR and the Sixth 
Fleet.  Hoehn declined to specify where NAVEUR and the Sixth 
Fleet might lodge, until the relevant government could be 
briefed.  (Later in the discussion, General Sanz noted press 
reports that the Sixth Fleet and NAVEUR would move to 
Naples.) 
 
3.  (C) Hoehn emphasized Rota and Moron remain important, 
enduring and sustainable elements of the U.S.-Spain relations 
and NATO.  He said that while local or regional commanders 
had the authority to make changes to maximize efficiency, 
Hoehn assured the Spanish the U.S. has no current plans to 
make significant changes to its presence at either base as a 
result of the posture review.  Hoehn said also the U.S. was 
still considering various locations at which to consolidate 
Special Operations Forces; we would provide the Spanish 
additional details on that score when they were available. 
 
4.  (C) Dezcallar replied that Spain understood the cost and 
efficiency realities and would likely make the same decision 
were it in the U.S.\'s shoes.  He agreed the political 
dimension should be the foundation for GDPR discussions with 
allies and assured the delegation the U.S. \"has a strong 
foundation in Spain,\" and that Spain wished to strengthen the 
relationship and take it as far as \"our common interests take 
us.\"  Spain wants to continue cooperating with the U.S. at 
the highest levels, said Dezcallar. 
 
5.  (C) Sanz said the \"51-year (military) relationship\" 
between Spain and the U.S. has been very fruitful for both 
countries, and that the countries\' relationship at the bases 
was very important for Spain.  Sanz requested more details 
both on the parts of GDPR that affect Spain and the elements 
that affect other countries.  Spain is of course concerned 
about the review\'s impact on Rota and Moron, and in 
particular the effect on \"social issues\" and Spanish jobs. 
 
6.  (C) Bloomfield explained that U.S. representatives were 
visiting a number of countries to discuss GDPR ramifications 
and preferred not to get into details before meeting with 
other governments.  After the USG had held those discussions, 
however, the U.S. would be happy to send a member of the 
Bloomfield delegation -- probably a EUCOM rep -- back to 
Spain to go into greater detail on GDPR\'s impact on Spain. 
However, the U.S. was interested in the GOS\'s views on our 
proposals now, or as soon as possible. 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  The atmosphere at this meeting was very 
positive, with the Spanish emphasizing the importance of 
positive relations with the U.S. and saying they appreciated 
being consulted on the posture review.  Conspicuously absent 
from the GOS reaction to the briefing was the military\'s 
oft-repeated position that the base relationship is too 
lopsided in the U.S.\'s favor.  Instead, Spanish officials 
expressed concern about the possible negative impact GDPR 
could have on Spanish jobs and infrastructure projects at the 
bases.  As is inevitable of late here in Madrid, where any 
and every issue related to foreign policy reaches the press, 
Spain, well-versed media reported on the visit, though there 
were no media present at the meeting and no press event 
afterward.  Press on the visit has been interesting:  One 
newspaper, Spain,s conservative ABC, gave an accurate 
account of the discussion, including the idea that Sixth 
Fleet and NAVEUR might not go to Rota.  Spain,s leftist, 
pro-Socialist El Pais reported just the opposite -- increases 
in the offing for Rota.  When queried by the press about the 
Bloomfield delegation\'s visit to Madrid, First Vice President 
de la Vega said the GOS \"does not have any knowledge of any 
extraordinary request\" from the U.S. relating to Rota or 
Moron.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, SP 
SUBJECT: ZAPATERO ECONOMIC ADVISOR OFFERS VIEWS ON 
PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH 
 
1. Summary.  Miguel Sebastian, President Zapatero\'s key 
economic advisor, recently presented his analysis on Spain\'s 
productivity and economic growth to corporate leaders. 
Sebastian declared that Spain\'s relatively low labor 
productivity is the most important issue that may hinder 
future economic growth.  He highlighted continued budgetary 
stability, investment in the labor force and infrastructure, 
and labor reform as government priorities that should help 
resolve the productivity problem and promote growth.  On 
budget issues, Sebastian promoted ideas supportive of the 
Ministry of Economy\'s efforts to move towards pro-cyclical 
budgeting, but questioned attempts to predict the business 
cycle and require governments of autonomous regions to follow 
balanced budget rules.  End Summary. 
 
Productivity and Growth 
----------------------- 
 
2. Miguel Sebastian, President Zapatero\'s Advisor, spoke June 
22 to an audience of Spain\'s corporate leaders regarding 
Spain\'s rate of economic growth.  Spain\'s productivity has 
fallen or stagnated in comparison to its economic competitors 
in the EU and the U.S. in recent years.  However, economic 
output improved due to the rise in employment and the 
increase in population due to immigration.  Sebastian noted 
that this rise in population is a short to medium term 
condition and will not ensure Spanish economic growth in the 
long run. 
 
3. Sebastian offered Ireland as an example of a country to 
emulate.  Both Ireland and Spain maintained growth rates 
higher than the EU average in the last eight years, with 
Ireland achieving the highest rate of growth in the EU 15. 
Unlike Spain, Ireland\'s economy witnessed improvement in both 
employment and productivity.  In the past eight years, 
Ireland\'s employment productivity rose 33% while Spain\'s 
productivity increased only 5%.  As Ireland pulled ahead on 
the productivity level, it achieved higher economic growth 
rates. 
 
Productivity Policy 
------------------- 
 
4. Budgetary discipline was the first policy issue Sebastian 
discussed regarding the government\'s role in promoting 
growth.  He argued that maintaining macroeconomic stability 
was important to a good business climate, but supported 
budgets that are balanced over economic cycles rather than 
rigid balanced budget strictures.  He followed his 
pro-cyclical budgeting statement by noting the impossibility 
of accurately predicting business cycles.  Finally, he argued 
that the government should not require autonomous regional 
governments to follow balanced budgets, but allow them to 
balance their budgets over the economic cycle as well.  The 
last two points are positions currently being considered by 
the Ministry of Economy.  Sebastian did not offer suggestions 
to achieve balanced budgets. 
 
5. Sebastian also supported government investment in work 
force development as a key means of promoting growth and 
productivity.  He mentioned the government\'s commitment to 
investment in education, and increased spending on public 
transportation to improve labor mobility within Spain.  In 
addition, Sebastian acknowledged the need to change the laws 
and regulations that inhibit companies from investing in 
their work force  He foresees an agreement this fall between 
employers\' groups, unions and the government that should 
address many of the structural causes of poor labor 
flexibility in Spain. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. Sebastian\'s message on productivity and government budget 
policy comes when these two subjects are the most discussed 
economic issues in the Spanish press.  Spain\'s labor 
productivity is well below the EU average, and is a problem 
the government promises to solve.  The mention of pro-worker 
investment initiatives may be an effort to introduce an 
incentive to the unions to support the likely weakening of 
rigid labor benefits that make employers less likely to hire 
and invest in human capital. 
 
7. The budget message is more challenging to decipher.  Vice 
President and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes 
has publicly affirmed his support for balancing budgets 
through economic cycles.  Due to strong economic forecasts, 
Spain will run a small surplus this year and probably next. 
Sebastian\'s comments seem to support the gist of Solbes\' 
policy.  His comments in favor of regional budgetary 
independence are interesting in the light of Solbes\' need to 
negotiate a new budgetary agreement with the regional 
governments.  Traditionally, Sebastian\'s position has had 
great influence in setting the overall economic agenda.  His 
relationship vis-a-vis Vice President Solbes, an 
internationally renowned economic heavyweight is still being 
defined.

1. Summary: A call to a key contact on Iraq reconstruction 
issues adds additional weight to assurances by high level GOS 
contacts that Spain would honor its Iraq Donors\' Conference 
commitments.  Our working level contact predicted the IFC $5 
million and half of the IRFFI $20 million would be disbursed 
by July with the remaining IRFFI $10 million moving later 
this year.  This timeline supports comments made by Secretary 
of State for Economy David Vegara (reftel), and signals that 
positive action is being taken at the working level.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. Our chief contact on Iraq reconstruction, Ministry of 
Economy Technical Advisor for International Finance Ines 
Menendez de Luarca Bellido, confirmed that the approval of 
the $5 million for the IFC Small Business Facility and $20 
million for the IRFFI is moving forward.  Higher ranking 
officials in the Ministry of Economy, including the Secretary 
of State for Economy Vegara (reftel) and the Director General 
for Finance assured us that Spain would live up to its Iraq 
reconstruction pledge.  Menendez\' affirmation of these 
statements confirms that the message has reached the working 
level and is being actively pursued. 
 
3. Menendez provided a rough timeline for the disbursements. 
She stated that the the Ministry of Economy had completed its 
internal approval process on the IFC $5 million and the IRFFI 
$20 million.  The next step is the July 8 meeting of the 
interministerial commission that approves all development 
funds.  The disbursement decision will then move to the 
subsequent Council of Ministers meeting.  Approval is 
expected by both groups.  Menendez predicted the IFC $5 
million and $10 million of the IRFFI transfer will be made in 
mid-late July.  The second half of the IRFFI funds should be 
disbursed by the end of the year. 
 
4. We will continue to track this issue, and notify 
Washington as the disbursement process reaches its final 
stages.

ON CHINA 
 
REF: STATE 137493 
 
Classified By: Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Political Counselor, for Reasons 1 
.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Spain continues to say that they believe the 
human rights situation in China is improving and that the EU 
arms embargo no longer makes sense. (Note: In our various 
approaches to senior levels of the previous government, we 
received a similar response.) Spain believes that it is 
important for the EU to send a positive signal to China, 
given the importance of the growing commercial interests 
between the two, and doubts that any actual arms sales will 
take place due to EU Code of Conduct restrictions.  While the 
GOS says that no date has been set, our interlocutors 
acknowledge that some in the EU would like the lifting of the 
embargo to take place this December.  Regarding the threat 
posed by sales of advanced arms to China, the GOS places the 
blame for tensions in the region on Taiwan.  Embassy 
delivered the demarche solo, as after agreement to deliver 
the demarche jointly with our Japanese colleagues, the 
Japanese embassy in Madrid later received instructions from 
the Japanese MFA not to accom 
pany us. 
 
2. (C) We delivered reftel demarche on June 25 to Enrique 
Mora, Director of the MFA\'s Office of EU Foreign Policy and 
Common Security.  DCM is reinforcing our concerns with Deputy 
Foreign Minister Bernadino Leon.  We had initially reached an 
agreement with the Japanese Political Counselor in Madrid, 
Kyoko Koga, to deliver the demarche jointly.  However, when 
Ms. Koga contacted her MFA superiors in Tokyo, she was told 
that they had just received our talking points that morning 
in Japan, and that after studying the document, they were 
declining to accompany us on the demarche. 
 
3. (C) Mora stated that Spain continues to disagree with us 
on the trend in human rights in China, as they view the 
situation as improving.  He said that maintaining the arms 
embargo had become \"ridiculous\" and that China did not belong 
in the league of other countries that the EU denies arms 
sales (Haiti, Sudan, etc.).  He noted that the EU was now the 
largest trading partner with China, surpassing the US and 
Japan, and that the EU needed to send a positive signal to 
China in order to keep building their \"strategic 
relationship\".  Mora acknowledged that some EU countries were 
pushing to announce the lifting of the embargo at the 
December EU-China summit, but said that no date had been 
fixed.  He added that some EU states, such as Denmark, may 
want to make the lifting of the embargo subject to certain 
conditions, such as the release of political prisoners or 
decreasing the use of the death penalty. 
 
4. (C) When we pressed on the threat posed by sales of 
advanced weaponry to China, especially given past Chinese 
actions, threats and posturing, Mora blamed Taiwan, replying 
that the situation \"only heats up when the Taiwanese heat it 
up\".  He compared Chinese remarks and posturing to Spain\'s 
position over Gibraltar (though when we made the comparison 
that Spain does not practice invasions of Gibraltar or 
conduct missile tests in the area, he agreed that Chinese 
behavior was different).  We also noted Chinese territorial 
and maritime claims against Japan, Vietnam and the 
Philippines, to which Mora acknowledged that the situation 
was more than just about Taiwan. 
 
5. (C) Mora stressed Spain\'s continuing belief that the EU 
Code of Conduct would prohibit any actual arms sales to 
China, and noted Russia as an example.  He said that the 
lifting of the embargo would only be symbolic, but that the 
symbolism was important to improve relations with China and 
that bringing China into the world community would increase 
security. 
 
6. (C) Mora acknowledged our offer to provide intelligence 
briefings on trends in PRC military modernization, but did 
not express an interest in receiving the briefings, saying 
only that he would pass the offer along.

TECHNICAL CHANGE 
 
REF: STATE 136811 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Poloff discussed reftel points June 24 
with Marcos Rodriguez in the MFA\'s Office of International 
Disarmament Affairs.  Poloff delivered the demarche jointly 
with Enrico Vencenti, political counselor at the Italian 
Embassy and Peter Spoor, first secretary political officer at 
the British Embassy.  Rodriguez said Spain favored changing 
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) to allow Libya to 
convert its chemical weapons facilities to be used for 
peaceful purposes.  However, Spain was still examining all 
options for adding the proposed technical change to the CWC, 
including an amendment.  Spain supports a \"sustainable, 
non-discriminatory, non-ad-hoc\" solution to change the CWC, 
but is unlikely to formulate a position before the June 
29-July 2 Executive Council meeting.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Rodriguez said that after consulting with France and 
Germany at the last NPT PrepCom III meeting and the Western 
European and Others Group (WEOG) meeting, Spain considered 
amending the CWC the best option to allow new countries to 
join the CWC and convert their chemical weapons facilities to 
be used for peaceful purposes.  Poloff reiterated reftel 
contingency points explaining why an amendment would not be 
necessary or appropriate in this case. 
 
3. (SBU) Rodriguez responded that these issues would have to 
be studied by the legal advisor in National Authority on 
Chemical Weapons in the Ministry of Industry.  Once reviewed, 
the Ministry of Industry would make a recommendation to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs.  The Minister would then send 
instructions to Spain\'s mission in The Hague.  This process 
would not give Spain time to formulate a position by the 
upcoming Executive Council meeting, scheduled for June 
29-July 2.  Therefore, Spain would likely ask for more time 
to consider the U.S. proposal for a technical change to the 
CWC. 
 
4. (SBU) Rodriguez said that he did not expect Spain to 
reject the draft language contained in U.S. proposed 
technical change to the CWC.  The question remains whether 
Spain would accept this measure as a technical change or as 
an amendment, as proposed by the French and Germans.  Spain 
is more likely to accept the U.S. proposal if France and 
Germany do not express strong objections to the U.S. draft 
proposal.  Poloff left a copy of the contingency points with 
the Rodriguez, as well as with the British and Italian 
political officers.  We will report any new developments in 
Spain\'s position.

SUBJECT: SPAIN\'S UNDERGROUND ECONOMY 
 
REF: A. MADRID 736 
 
     B. MADRID 604 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Several European researchers have published 
studies outlining the problem of Spain\'s underground economy. 
 The most recent study, published by Friedrich Schneider in 
March 2004, claims that Spain\'s underground economy is 
currently equivalent to 22.3% of official GDP.  Spain\'s 
continually high unemployment and illegal immigration have 
accompanied the incidence of significant informal economic 
activity.  Unreported labor and income are more prevalent in 
predominantly unskilled sectors such as agriculture, 
construction, and some services.  The European Commission 
(EC) criticized the GOS in 2002 for its lack of coordination 
in dealing with underground economic activity, observing that 
the GOS tends to react to easily observable offenses instead 
of proactively seeking preventative measures.  Spain seems to 
benefit from tolerating at least some underground economic 
activity and is unlikely to combat it in the near future. 
END SUMMARY 
 
THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM 
----------------------- 
 
2. (U) Published in March 2004, Friedrich Schneider\'s study 
entitled \"Shadow Economies around the World: What Do We 
Know?\" surveys the economic landscape of 110 so-called shadow 
or underground economies.  The underground economy is defined 
as \"those economic activities and the income derived from 
them that circumvent or otherwise evade government 
regulation, taxation or observation.\"  In 2003, Spain\'s 
informal sector summed to 22.3% of official GDP, making it 
the third largest of OECD countries only surpassed by that of 
Italy and Greece.  While common perception is that 
underground economic activity is undesirable, Schneider found 
that an increase of 1% in the underground economy of an 
industrialized country results in a 0.8% increase in the 
official GDP.  His analysis showed that an increasing burden 
of taxation and social security contributions combined with 
greater state regulatory activities are the driving forces 
behind the growth and size of the shadow economy. 
 
3. (U) A 2001 study on the Spanish underground economy 
conducted by the Institute of Fiscal Studies of the Spanish 
Department of Treasury in cooperation with the Universidad 
Complutense de Madrid estimated Spain\'s underground economy 
to be 20% of GDP.  The report analyzes the growth of Spain\'s 
shadow economy over a twenty-year period on a regional basis. 
 It shows that over the last two decades, Spain\'s underground 
economy expanded from 15% to 20% of GDP.  Tenerife, Ciudad 
Real, and La Rioja were provinces with the largest 
underground economies.  Other, earlier studies have 
calculated Spain\'s underground economy as ranging from 20% to 
as high as 40% of official GDP. 
 
4. (U) The EC has also looked at the underground economy in 
Spain as part of a larger study on the issue in the EU.  The 
EC found that Spain has the second largest informal sector of 
the then EU-15, surpassed only by Italy.  According to this 
study, the Spanish underground economy is estimated to equal 
23% of GNP (7% more than the European Community average) and 
accounted for 120 billion euros (USD 143 billion at 1 euro = 
USD 1.19) of undeclared earnings.  The EC\'s study urged Spain 
to convert illegal employment into legal employment.  The 
study\'s authors criticized GOS policy for being ill suited to 
respond to growth in the underground economy, tending to 
react to the problem rather than consider ways to prevent it. 
 Furthermore, the EC reported that there is little 
cooperation amongst GOS agencies and instead each agency has 
its own priorities when it comes to reducing the underground 
economy. 
 
REASONS FOR UNDERGROUND ECONOMY 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) These studies indicate that rising labor costs and 
high social security taxes are key factors behind underground 
economies in Europe.  In the case of Spain, a confluence of 
two additional trends helped stimulate high levels of 
informal economic activity.  First, Spain historically has 
maintained a high unemployment rate (24.2% at its peak in 
1994, and currently 11.3%).  Second, Spain is a refuge for 
economic migrants from Latin America and, more recently, 
Northern Africa.  While not all immigrants are destined for 
the underground economy, statistics of detected illegal 
workers in Spain reveal that participation of immigrants in 
the underground economy has increased substantially.  By 2001 
(the most current statistics available), immigrants 
represented more than a third of detected illegal workers. 
 
SECTORS 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) The sectors that generally have the largest number 
of workers in the shadow economy are those that require 
minimal educational and professional formation. This is 
evidenced in cities like Tenerife, a tourism hub that is in 
the midst of a construction boom, Ciudad Real province, 
active in textile production, and La Rioja, an agricultural 
and leather production center.  The studies show that the 
highest concentration of illegal workers in Spain is in the 
agriculture, construction, and service sectors.  Gayle 
Allard, an economist at the Institute of Business (Instituto 
de Empresa) in Spain, opined that undocumented labor is a 
hidden subsidy for all of these affected sectors. 
Underground economic activity is beneficial not only for the 
private sector, but also more profitable for the GOS than 
enforcing their own tax and immigration laws.  The increased 
amount of immigrant labor in construction is a recent 
phenomenon linked to Spain\'s housing boom (reftel B) and the 
expansion of tourism and hotel construction along the coasts 
of southern Spain.  Allard believes that it is beneficial for 
the time being to have a subsidized construction sector to 
help lift Spain out of the recent recession. 
 
IMPACT OF UNDERGROUND ECONOMY 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (U) An underground economy of approximately 21% of Spanish 
GDP is roughly equivalent to 130 billion euros (USD 155 
billion).  This translates into significant unrealized tax 
revenue for the Spanish government.  A large informal sector 
also creates an atmosphere conducive to other illegal 
activities such as selling drugs and the piracy of 
intellectual property goods (e.g. software, CD\'s, DVD\'s, 
videogames, brand name clothing), which are significant 
problem in Spain (reftel A).  Spain\'s Treasury Department has 
calculated that the selling of one kilogram (2.2 lbs.) of 
pirated CD\'s is five times more profitable than one kilogram 
of hashish. 
 
8. (SBU) The underground economy also distorts Spain\'s 
economic statistics.  For example, some studies suggest that 
as much as one-third of the unemployed are involved in the 
underground economy.  If correct, this would mean that 
Spain\'s high unemployment rate is at least partially 
artificial.  If the GOS can, as the EC report urges it to do, 
transfer underground occupations to the legitimate labor 
force, this inflated unemployment figure could fall 
substantially and social security coffers could grow. 
 
GOS ACTION AND REACTION 
----------------------- 
 
9. (U) The EC report characterizes Spain\'s policy toward the 
underground economy as reactive and uncoordinated.  The GOS 
claims to be combating the problem by investigating illegal 
employment and unclaimed income cases.  For example, in 
summer 2002, Spain\'s Department of Treasury dispatched 200 
government officials along the coasts of Spain in an attempt 
to detect illegal employment and tax evasion.  If individuals 
or businesses were suspected of tax fraud, the officials 
would initiate an investigation of their tax claims.  Another 
inspection conducted by the Spanish Department of Labor had 
more tangible results, by recuperating 435.5 million euros 
(USD 520.5 million) in unpaid social security contributions. 
From January to June of 2002, the Department of Labor found 
33,215 underground workers, of which 4,137 were foreigners 
without work permits.  As a result of the inspections, GOS 
fined businesses 7.3 million euros (USD 8.7 million) and 
illegal immigrants 25 million euros (USD 29.9 million) for 
illegal employment. 
 
10. (SBU) While current action has allowed GOS to recover 
some lost tax revenue and punish employers for illegal labor 
practices, the current policy is not effective in shrinking 
the underground economy.  Instead of acting in advance to 
deter unreported employment or employment of illegal 
immigrants, its policies focus on reaction by giving 
disproportionate fines to employees instead of employers in 
the shadow economy.  While any action represents a 
commendable step, the EC suggests that preventative action 
through coordinated policies would prove to be more 
successful at reducing the submerged economy.  As the EC 
report found, the policies of the various government agencies 
are not coordinated.  That lack of harmonized policies leaves 
the government with misaligned goals, resulting in a 
governmental principal-agent dilemma.  Pilar L\'Hotellerie, 
head of analysis of the Spanish economy for the Bank of 
Spain, said that although the new socialist government is 
paying slightly more attention to tax evasion and fraud than 
the former Popular Party (PP) government, she does not expect 
to see any form of legislation intended to deter underground 
economic activity in the foreseeable future. 
 
11.(SBU) COMMENT:  The GOS usually turns a blind eye to 
underground economic activity in traditionally important 
sectors such as agriculture and construction.  Untaxed 
factors of production act as a hidden subsidy, increasing the 
country\'s general economic welfare in sectors where official 
subsidies are impossible to enact because of GOS-EU trade 
obligations.  In many of these markets Spain is in direct 
competition with low labor-cost producers, and without these 
hidden subsidies domestic firms would exit.  There is no 
question that the underground economy has contributed to 
Spain\'s remarkable economic growth since joining the EU. 
Absent budgetary pressures or stronger EC urging to curb such 
activity, we see no change in the role or size of Spain\'s 
underground economy in the near future.  END COMMENT

E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/29/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PTER, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN: AMBASSADOR PAYS COURTESY CALL ON INTERIOR 
MINISTER 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador George L. Argyros, reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, paid a courtesy call 
June 24 on Minister of Interior Jose Antonio Alonso. 
Ambassador thanked Alonso for all the support Embassy has 
received on various security issues and commented on the 
outreach already made by Alonso with his U.S. counterpart 
(Alonso has spoken to DHS Secretary Ridge).  Ambassador 
encouraged continued contact between Alonso and Ridge and 
suggested Alonso visit Washington at his earliest 
convenience.  Alonso agreed a U.S. visit was a good idea and 
suggested perhaps late September or early October would be a 
good time for the trip.  Alonso also said he was happy with 
the cooperation his ministry has had with U.S. Embassy 
offices and said the change in government should not affect 
those excellent relationships.  In fact, he hoped they would 
grow stronger, especially in the area of counter-terrorism. 
 
2.  (C) Ambassador raised the upcoming visit of the Visa 
Waiver Program team with Alonso.  Ambassador explained the 
team would visit to review Spain\'s continued eligibility to 
participate in the visa waiver program and asked that all 
elements within the Ministry of Interior cooperate with the 
team.  Alonso said he would ensure his ministry was helpful 
and forthcoming with the team. 
 
3.  (C) Ambassador asked Alonso for his latest thinking on 
the National Counter-terrorism Coordination Center that Spain 
is considering establishing.  Alonso stated it would start 
out as an analysis and risk evaluation organization and 
eventually the future center would change to produce 
strategic plans and perhaps be more operational.  Alonso said 
Spain was not the only country looking at this concept -- 
other countries in the EU were also doing the same, and in 
fact High Representative Solana had presented a plan in the 
EU.  Spain\'s concept is to implement the new center 
gradually.  It will likely start out small with about 40 
staff. 
 
4.  (C) Ambassador asked Alonso about the challenge the GOS 
faces trying to foster greater coordination between the 
Spanish National Police and the Civil Guard.  Alonso said 
coordination problems were a concern but were not unique to 
Spain.  Both police entities have closed cultures which are 
hard to change.  Getting them to share databases is the first 
step. 
 
5.  (C) Alonso mentioned the GOS is trying to get a handle on 
Islamic terrorism in Spain.  He said there is a lack of 
information and analysis relating to the problem, not only in 
Spain but also in the EU.  In spite of having millions of 
Muslims living in the EU, Europeans know very little about 
them. 
 
6.  (C) Ambassador reviewed all the law enforcement 
representatives present at post and offered any assistance 
Spanish authorities needed on counter-terrorism, security or 
any other matter.  Alonso proposed that representatives of 
the various agencies meet at the technical level on a 
frequent basis and discuss specific agenda items.  Ambassador 
informed Alonso him we were in the process of doing just that 
and an early July meeting had been scheduled where DCM and 
Director General for Security Camacho would bring together 
the appropriate staff members and meet. 
 
7. (C) Ambassador asked Alonso whether the GOS was 
considering amendments to Spain\'s criminal laws that would 
allow suspects be detained until more information was 
obtained.  Alonso, who is a former judge, responded it was 
not a matter of the law needing reform.  Under the Spanish 
system the judges own the investigation and they see each 
individual case on its own merit rather than seeing the case 
as part of the overall terrorism conflict.  Rather, he said, 
the GOS was using administrative deportation procedures to 
get rid of problematic suspects.  Laws will not be reformed 
in his view -- they are harsh enough.  The GOS is, however, 
looking at easing wiretap requirements so they are similar to 
French norms.  In Spain, police currently must have 
permission from judges before they can perform wiretaps. 
Alonso said he did not know if public opinion would accept a 
change in this practice. 
 
8.  (C) The Ambassador urged the GOS should continue its 
strong efforts to tighten laws on terrorism financing.  Great 
progress has been made but more work needs to be done to 
refine the laws.  Alonso agreed and said the GOS understood 
the important link between curbing terrorism financing and 
stopping terrorism.  He noted that the Basque terrorist group 
ETA has become much weaker as a result of losing a lot of its 
financial support.

TREASURY PLEASE PASS TRACI PHILLIPS 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN INCREASES MINIMUM WAGE MIDYEAR 
 
1. The Spanish Council of Ministers approved June 26 a 6.6% 
increase in the minimum wage to EUR 490.80 (USD 599.34) from 
EUR 460.50 (USD 562.40) per month.  The new wage will be 
effective July 1.  This increase will affect 600,000 workers. 
 The increase in cost to the Spanish government is predicted 
to be EUR 252 million (USD 307 million) per year due to 
increased government salaries and unemployment benefits. 
Even with the increase, Spain will continue to have the 
second lowest minimum wage of EU-15 countries, followed by 
Portugal. 
 
2. While the minimum wage is usually set annually in the 
national budget bill, the Socialist government decided to 
increase the wage mid-year to return the minimum wage to 
parity with the inflation rate.  The minimum wage has risen 
2% per year since 2000.  The consumer price index has risen 
faster than the minimum every year since 1999, resulting in a 
de facto 6% decline in the minimum wage.  The 6.6% increase 
will be the first increase in the real minimum wage since 
1999. 
 
3. The Council of Ministers\' decision was made by Royal 
Decree (equivalent to an Executive Order), and was not 
discussed in the legislature.  It is a temporary measure 
until the government introduces legislation to change the 
many related laws.  The Socialist administration publicly 
reaffirmed its commitment to raise the minimum wage to EUR 
600 (USD 732) per month by 2008, prior to the next election. 
 
4. The Royal Decree also decoupled the link between the 
minimum wage and certain social benefits.  Previously the 
minimum wage was used as the base figure for computing 
several types of public benefits including scholarships, 
schoolbook subsidies, food assistance and access to public 
housing.  These services will now be linked to a new figure, 
IPREM (Indicador Publico de Rentas de Efectos Multiples), 
which will be set at the old minimum wage of EUR 460.50 (USD 
652.40) per month, and will continue to be set each year in 
the national budget bill, based on projected inflation rather 
than real inflation rates.  Unemployment benefits will 
continue to track with the minimum wage. 
 
5. Comment.  The EUR 30 (USD 36.6) per month increase in the 
minimum wage allows the Socialist government to show that it 
is keeping up with some of its campaign promises in pragmatic 
fashion.  The GOS can claim that they are moving towards the 
EUR 600 (USD 732) per month promise incrementally, and the 
delinking of the minimum wage with benefits prevents the 
change from being too costly.

1.  (C) Summary:  The previous Spanish government under 
President Jose Maria Aznar was long in the forefront within 
the EU and on its own in criticizing Cuban human rights 
abuses, lack of movement toward democracy and absence of 
fundamental rights for Cuban citizens.  The current 
government under Socialist President Jose Luis Rodriguez 
Zapatero, who took office in mid-April this year, has not 
softened Spain\'s position on Cuba but neither has it overtly 
continued Aznar\'s strident criticism.  The past six months 
saw a continuation of Spain\'s actions and policies advocating 
a tough stance against the Castro regime.  Although it is 
difficult to predict Zapatero\'s policies and actions toward 
Cuba, the absence of a Title III suspension might encourage 
the GOS to soften its position on Cuba both bilaterally and 
within the EU.  Moreover, Spain would likely claim the U.S. 
has violated the common understanding reached with the EU 
concerning the Libertad Act (the Act) in May 2000.  End 
summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
SPAIN TOWARD CUBA UNDER AZNAR 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Embassy provides this review of Spain\'s recent Cuba 
policy in response to ref A.  Jose Maria Aznar\'s government 
was a strident critic of the Castro regime practically until 
the day Aznar departed office in mid-April 2004.  Aznar was a 
prime force behind the hardening of the EU\'s position on Cuba 
after the Castro regime arrested more than 70 dissidents in 
March 2003.  In June 2003, the EU announced that as a result 
of the arrest and sentencing of these dissidents, it would 
encourage member states to limit bilateral high-level 
government visits, reduce their participation in cultural 
events, and invite Cuban dissidents to national day 
celebrations.  The EU also threatened to re-examine the EU\'s 
common position on Cuba.  The Aznar government pushed hard 
for these measures and firmly supported them from the time 
the measures were announced until it handed over power to the 
Socialists in April.  The Aznar government condemned the 
Castro regime multiple times in that period for its human 
rights abuses, lack of democratic reforms and failure to 
guarantee fundamental rights for its citizens.  As a result 
of Spain\'s hard line, the Castro regime shut down Spain\'s 
binational cultural center in Havana. 
 
3.  (C) In addition, at the USG\'s urging, the Aznar 
government in April 2004 pressed Honduras to sponsor this 
year\'s UNCHR resolution on Cuba.  Honduras eventually did 
sponsor the resolution (after considerable reluctance).  The 
Aznar government was also a key player in the EU\'s eventual 
decision to oppose Cotonou membership for Cuba, forcing the 
Castro regime to withdraw its application.  In sum, the Aznar 
government did much to advance democracy, human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in Cuba while it was in power. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
ZAPATERO GOVERNMENT\'S APPROACH TO CASTRO REGIME 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  (C) Since taking office in mid-April, the Zapatero 
government has not taken any actions or announced policy 
modifications that change Spain\'s Cuba policy as it existed 
under Aznar.  As Embassy has previously reported (ref B), 
Foreign Ministry officials have told us Spain will maintain 
its tough stance on Cuba, saying Castro has done nothing to 
merit softening of the strong stand Spain and the EU have 
taken against the regime\'s human rights violations and 
refusal to allow democratic reforms.  The officials have 
said, however, that the GOS would prefer to tone down the 
rhetoric that went back and forth between Castro and Aznar, 
and if possible, return to some form of dialogue with Cuba. 
In the end, given Cuba\'s intransigence, they viewed this as 
highly unlikely.  They have also said they do not plan to 
take the same leadership role Aznar did on Cuba within the EU 
and would opt to be minimally involved in formulating or 
influencing EU policy on Cuba. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
IMPACT ON COOPERATION WITH SPAIN IF WAIVER NOT RENEWED 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5.  (C) The GOS, like the EU, has always bristled at the Act 
as a piece of extraterritorial legislation which is probably 
contrary to the WTO and represents the imposition of U.S. 
foreign policy on its friends and allies.  Spain is also 
bound by EU and subsequent Spanish implementing legislation 
forbidding nationals or companies from cooperating with 
foreign legislation such as that embodied in the Act. 
Companies or nationals that do cooperate with foreign 
governments to implement such measures will be prosecuted and 
fined under Spanish law, and the GOS will be obliged to 
report these events to the EU.  Spain presumes the U.S. is 
still acting under the May 2000 understanding with the EU 
concerning enforcement of the Act and pursuit of a waiver. 
 
6.  (C) Despite Spain\'s opposition to the Act, the attitude 
of the Aznar government toward the Castro regime was the 
closest to ours of any Spanish government previously and one 
of the closest, if not the closest, of any of our allies that 
have ties to Cuba.  While the Zapatero government may not be 
as openly critical of Cuba as was its predecessor, it has 
taken no action to soften Aznar\'s hard line.  Were the waiver 
not renewed, we expect the Zapatero government to contend the 
EU-U.S. understanding on the Act had been broken. 
Non-waiver would also give the GOS cover to seek 
normalization of dialogue with Cuba, whatever that would 
entail.  Given Spain\'s long-standing hard line against Cuba 
and the fact that by all appearances the Zapatero government 
plans to continue that hard line (even if it does not plan to 
be as critical as Aznar), the USG would have little to gain 
and much to lose in achieving its foreign policy goals by not 
renewing the waiver.

SUBJECT: SPAIN: ZAPATERO GOVERNMENT AUTHORIZES AFGHANISTAN 
CONTRIBUTION; PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL LIKELY 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission J. Robert Manzanares, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  The Zapatero government\'s Council of 
Ministers approved July 2 a substantial increase in Spain\'s 
presence in Afghanistan.  Zapatero will put the contribution 
to a parliamentary vote Tuesday, July 6.  We expect 
parliament to approve the contribution.  The GOS has proposed 
to increase its Afghanistan presence to a total of between 
940 and 1,040 troops.  In addition, according to the GOS 
plan, Spain would contribute 4 helicopters, 2 C-130s and a 
field hospital.  Included in the 940-1,040 figure would be a 
battalion of 400-500 troops to provide security for 
elections.  This is welcome news from the Zapatero government 
and the first sign it wishes to stay engaged in fighting 
international terror since Zapatero pulled Spain\'s troops 
from Iraq.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U) Zapatero\'s Council of Ministers formally approved the 
Afghanistan contribution that Foreign Minister Moratinos and 
Defense Minister had briefed to the Congress\'s foreign 
affairs and defense committees July 1.  Of the total of 
940-1,040 troops, 540 troops would be distributed among 
Spain\'s 115-troop contribution to Eurocorps, a field 
hospital, support for 4 helicopters and 2 C-130s and other 
support and protection elements.  In addition, the GOS has 
proposed to send a battalion of 400-500 troops for a total of 
90 days to provide security for Afghan elections currently 
expected to be held in September. 
 
3.  (U) The Zapatero government also announced it plans to 
withdraw its frigate currently supporting Operation Enduring 
Freedom in the Indian Ocean (with its 217 sailors), and 
approximately 130 additional troops currently stationed in 
Afghanistan. 
 
4.  (C) Comment:  This long awaited announcement from the 
Zapatero government is welcome news and represents the first 
significant sign the GOS wishes to stay engaged in the fight 
against international terror since it withdrew Spain\'s troops 
from Iraq in May.  Zapatero has said he will seek a vote in 
parliament to support the Afghanistan deployment, and all 
indications are the legislature will handily approve the 
move.  The vote will likely happen Tuesday, July 6.

SUBJECT: SPAIN: AMBASSADOR CALLS ON OPPOSITION LEADER 
 
Classified By: Ambassador George L. Argyros, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy, meeting 
with the Ambassador June 30, was upbeat about the PP\'s 
showing in the June European Parliament elections and in the 
party\'s prospects to regain power.  Rajoy upbraided the 
Zapatero government for causing strains with Washington and 
for Zapatero\'s subordination to the French.  Rajoy reaffirmed 
the PP\'s pro-US orientation and the party\'s support for the 
deployment of additional Spanish troops to Afghanistan. 
Rajoy said he would seek reaffirmation as the PP\'s Secretary 
General at the next party congress in September.  End Summary 
 
2.  (C) Ambassador and poloff met July 1 with Mariano Rajoy, 
Secretary General of the opposition Popular Party (PP) and 
 
SIPDIS 
unsuccessful presidential candidate in Spain\'s March 14 
elections.  Rajoy was positive and upbeat during the meeting, 
saying he enjoyed his role in the opposition but looked 
forward to defeating the Spanish Socialist Workers Party 
(PSOE) whenever the next elections take place.  Rajoy 
believed the PP achieved an excellent result in the June 13 
European Parliament elections by winning nearly as many seats 
as the PSOE (only one seat fewer) and only two percentage 
points fewer in total votes, particularly since PSOE \"based 
their entire campaign on the Iraq pullout.\" 
 
3.  (C) Rajoy stated the PSOE has spent most of its time 
since taking office reversing policies or projects of the PP. 
 The Zapatero government has shifted foreign policy away from 
the transatlantic relationship and toward France, has 
reversed PP education reforms and has squelched a 
controversial plan approved by the Aznar government to 
transfer water from rivers in the north to the arid south. 
The PSOE has fanned anti-American sentiments in Spain to gain 
political advantage. 
 
4.  (C) Rajoy assured the Ambassador the PP maintains the 
same foreign policy it did while Aznar was in office, not 
only with respect to the U.S. but also in terms of Spain\'s 
relationship with Europe.  The PP is extremely troubled by 
Zapatero\'s strong shift toward Europe and his apparent desire 
to side with France \"at every opportunity.\" 
 
5.  (C) Ambassador asked Rajoy what he thought of Zapatero\'s 
performance at the NATO Istanbul Summit.  Rajoy replied he 
was perplexed that Zapatero inexplicably left the summit 
before the first day had concluded.  He also felt Zapatero 
made a mistake supporting France\'s opposition to sending the 
NATO Response Force to Afghanistan.  This was yet another 
example of Zapatero blindly following France\'s lead, said the 
PP leader. 
 
6.  (C) On Afghanistan, Rajoy said he was certain the 
government would send additional troops to Afghanistan, 
including a battalion to assist with election security.  The 
PP will support the deployment. 
 
7.  (C) Rajoy said he believes that in terms of economic 
policy, PSOE chose a fine minister of economy in Pedro 
Solbes.  He is the most talented member of Zapatero\'s 
cabinet.  Solbes has had to brake a number of initiatives by 
other ministries and the big outstanding question is whether 
he will continue to be able to hold off policies that are bad 
for the economy. 
 
8.  (C) Regarding his own future, Rajoy said he intended to 
remain the PP Secretary General.   Rajoy said he would 
present himself as a candidate at the party\'s national 
convention expected to be held in October. 
 
9.  (C) Comment:  The close result in the June 13 European 
Parliament election has revived the confidence of the PP 
leadership, which had been shaken by the PP\'s unexpected 
defeat in last March\'s general election.  A poor showing on 
June 13 would have increased pressure for an alternative to 
Rajoy to emerge within the party.  Rajoy\'s position now 
appears secure.  Many in the PP expect the Socialist 
government to unravel over the next two years.  They predict 
a less robust economic climate and a crisis over the PSOE\'s 
inability to deal with nationalist demands, including from 
within the party\'s own Catalan wing.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAIR, ECON, CVIS, SP 
SUBJECT: IBERIA PULLING \"MINI-HUB\" OUT OF MIAMI; SALVADORAN 
AIRLINE TACA TO BENEFIT 
 
1.  Summary:  Today, Iberia Airlines announced plans to fly 
directly to Guatemala and Panama, avoiding the Miami 
International Airport for \"purely financial\" reasons, 
beginning in October.  Nevertheless, an Iberia contact told 
us that increased layover time due to new security procedures 
in Miami played heavily in client requests that Iberia have a 
more direct means of traveling between Spain and Europe and 
Central America.  The same Iberia executive acknowledged that 
Florida officials have attempted to enable Iberia to maintain 
its \"mini-hub\" in Miami.  Although codeshare possibilities 
for traffic between Miami and Central America have been 
offered to a US carrier, Salvadoran carrier TACA might get 
this business (possibly due to antitrust concerns), as well 
as feeder flights from various Central American airports to 
Iberia,s Central American stopovers.  End Summary. 
 
2.  We met with Iberia Airlines International Relations 
Director Elvira Herrero Mateo on July 6 to discuss Iberia,s 
plans to fly directly to several Central America capitals, 
avoiding Miami International Airport.  Herrero said that it 
was \"difficult financially to maintain the four aircraft\" at 
its \"mini-hub\" in Miami which currently serves Central 
American capitals and offers at least ten flights on most 
days into Miami.  She also cited increased security 
procedures at the Miami airport as a reason why European and 
Central American transit customers requested an alternative 
to the Miami connection. 
 
3.  Along with the elimination of these connections from 
Miami to various cities in Central America, Iberia will cut 
one of its two daily round-trip flights between Madrid and 
Miami.  Herrero denied that AirMadrid,s new direct flights 
to several Central American cities had any impact on 
Iberia,s decision to serve Central America with direct 
flights.  (Comment:  Currently AirMadrid does not even accept 
passengers originating in Central America:  the trip must 
originate in Spain.  Surprisingly, Herrero did not seem to 
know about this peculiar requirement of AirMadrid.  End 
Comment.) 
 
PLANNED CIRCULAR ROUTE: MADRID TO GUATEMALA CITY TO PANAMA 
CITY TO MADRID. 
 
4.  Herrero described the new \"direct\" routing as a circular 
one, in which an aircraft will travel from Madrid to 
Guatemala to Panama to Madrid.  When asked why Guatemala City 
and Panama City were selected, Herrero explained that these 
destinations provide the most passengers to Iberia.  Herrero 
added that another airport is being considered as an 
additional stop on Iberia\'s route. 
 
SALVADORAN AIRLINE TACA WILL CONNECT OTHER MAJOR CENTRAL 
AMERICAN AIRPORTS TO THE IBERIA FLIGHT 
 
5.  It is likely that the Salvadoran airline TACA will 
provide service from other Central American airports to 
Guatemala City and Panama City for passengers to join the 
circular route.  Herrero noted that TACA has an extensive 
Central American network, and is well positioned to connect 
Central American clients to the new Iberia flight. 
 
SOME TRAFFIC STILL TO GO THROUGH MIAMI ON CODESHARE 
 
6.  Iberia still anticipates some Spanish traffic will route 
through Miami.  Passengers could fly from Spain to Miami on 
Iberia, and then board a codeshare flight to their final 
destinations (or vice versa).  Herrero said that Iberia 
approached American Airlines about codesharing American 
flights from Miami to various Central American cities, but 
speculated that antitrust concerns may be preventing American 
Airlines from viewing their proposal positively.  She cited a 
Department of Justice Notice of Action dated 30 April 1998 in 
which the DOJ stated that it will \"defer on\" its decisions 
regarding \"codeshare services between Miami and points in 
Central America\" as supporting this speculation. 
 
WILL SPAIN BECOME A TARGET FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FROM 
CENTRAL AMERICA? 
 
7.  Spain currently does not require tourist visas from most 
Central American countries.  Since Central American travelers 
to Europe typically needed to pass through Miami, US visa 
regulations have generally served as an effective barrier for 
the would-be Central American illegal immigrant to Spain. 
Iberia\'s new circular route will eliminate this disincentive, 
possibly making Spain a more accessible destination.  The GOS 
has imposed visa requirements for some South American 
countries whose nationals have abused Spain\'s visa-free 
travel provisions.  We anticipate that the GOS will closely 
monitor immigration patterns as this new route brings 
travelers to Spain from Central America. 
 
8.  Comment:  While one less flight to and from Spain each 
day might seem insignificant, the elimination of Iberia\'s 
mini-hub in Miami will result in less European and Central 
American traveler stopovers in Florida for tourism, shopping 
and business.  Additionally, for those who still prefer to go 
through Miami on their way to Spain and Europe, it is 
regrettable that a US carrier may be losing the opportunity 
to pick up Iberia,s traffic through a codeshare.  End 
Comment.

1.  (C) Summary:  The GOS was dissatisfied that the NPT 
PrepCom III conference did not focus on broad 
nonproliferation issues, according to the MFA\'s 
non-proliferation office.  Our MFA interlocutors believe that 
unless substantive priorities are identified during follow-up 
consultations, the 2005 RevCom is unlikely to be successful. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Poloff met June 28 with Marcos Rodriguez in the MFA\'s 
Office of International Disarmament Affairs to hear GOS views 
on NPT PrepCom III per reftel.  Rodriguez told us that 
PrepCom lacked substantive discussion on how to strengthen 
the NPT.  Non-compliance, non-state actors, nuclear 
disarmament, and security assurances are key issues that 
should be discussed during follow-up consultations if RevCon 
2005 is to be successful, Rodriguez said.  Rodriguez was also 
concerned that non-compliance issues would not be properly 
emphasized at the RevCom 2005 because Brazilian 
President-Designate Duarte may take an anti-Western, 
anti-U.S. view. 
 
3.  (C) Rodriguez told us that Spain shares the U.S. view 
that non-compliance by Iran, Libya, and North Korea is a 
major problem.  He said Spain was pleased with how the U.S. 
delegation discussed its position on Article VI policies.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/07/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, MOPS, SP, NATO 
SUBJECT: SPANISH PARLIAMENT OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVES 
AFGHANISTAN TROOP INCREASE 
 
REF: MADRID 2529 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires J. Robert Manzanares, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  The Spanish Parliament overwhelmingly 
approved July 6 President Zapatero\'s proposal to increase 
substantially Spain\'s troop presence in Afghanistan.  The 
vote was 302 in favor, 10 against and 1 abstention.  Only the 
former communist United Left party and several obscure 
parties opposed the increase.  Zapatero told parliament Spain 
should commit the troops to continue its role in the \"fight 
against terrorism\" and because, unlike the Iraq war, ISAF was 
\"legally\" sanctioned by the UN, and NATO firmly supported the 
force.  Parliament approved an increase of  Spain\'s 
Afghanistan presence to a total of between 940 and 1,040 
troops.  Included in the 940-1,040 figure is a battalion of 
400-500 troops to provide security for elections.  The 540 
additional troops will be distributed among Spain\'s 115-troop 
contingent in Eurocorps and support and security elements for 
4 helicopters, 2 C-130s and a field hospital (reftel).  While 
the contribution may be comparatively small, the Zapatero 
government believes it is significant and wants the U.S. to 
perceive it as a major step.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Zapatero launched the debate explaining at length 
his justification for deployment.  Drawing a contrast with 
his perception of the Iraq war and subsequent security 
operations there, Zapatero said an increase in Spain\'s 
presence in Afghanistan was consistent with PSOE\'s support of 
the Aznar government\'s decision to send troops there in the 
first place, and was legal under international law.  Zapatero 
repeated multiple times during his speech that his proposed 
troop increased was consistent with international law and the 
various UN resolutions on Afghanistan. 
 
3.  (SBU) Popular Party opposition leader Mariano Rajoy 
replied first that Zapatero had broken a campaign promise to 
consult parliament before deciding to send troops abroad. 
This decision, said Rajoy, was already made before Zapatero 
brought his proposal to parliament.  But Rajoy was most 
emphatic when he said the PP supported the troop increase and 
criticized Zapatero for appearing \"ashamed\" to deploy the 
troops.  \"If you were in my position,\" said Rajoy, \"you would 
oppose sending the troops and your party would take to the 
streets immediately to denounce the decision.\"  Instead of 
appearing ill at east with his own decision, Zapatero should 
tell the Spanish people he is \"proud that Spain will 
participate in a mission like Afghanistan, fighting terror 
and standing close with Spain\'s allies.\"  Spain should \"feel 
good about itself\" when it fulfills its international 
responsibilities,\" asserted Rajoy. 
 
4.  (SBU) After more than four hours of debate, the 
parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of the deployment. 
Only the former communist United Left party and a couple of 
regional fringe parties voted against.  The final count:  In 
favor of the deployment, 302; against 10; abstain, 1. 
 
5.  (C) The Zapatero proposal that parliament endorsed 
includes increasing Spain\'s Afghanistan presence to a total 
of between 940 and 1,040 troops.  Included in the 940-1,040 
figure is a battalion of 400-500 troops to provide security 
for elections.  The 540 additional troops will be distributed 
among Spain\'s 115-troop contingent in Eurocorps and support 
and security elements for 4 helicopters, 2 C-130s and a field 
hospital (reftel). 
 
6.  (SBU) Parliament also voted to send a peacekeeping 
contingent of civil guard members to Haiti by a similar 
margin.  While Zapatero did not name a number, government 
sources say approximately 100 Civil Guard will be sent. 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  Zapatero\'s proposal to send substantially 
more troops to Afghanistan and parliament\'s overwhelming 
approval of the plan is the first sign since the Socialists\' 
March 14 electoral victory that Spain will remain 
significantly engaged in the fight against international 
terrorism ) albeit only in circumstances that can be 
construed as humanitarian and, in Spain\'s judgment, fully 
authorized by the UN.  The Socialists have told us repeatedly 
since they came to power they wish to maintain excellent 
relations with the United States and to remain a faithful 
ally.  We have been strongly urging the GOS to make this 
statement concrete by increasing Spain,s participation in 
Afghanistan.  Spain\'s Afghanistan contribution, while it 
could have been greater, is larger than expected.  The GOS 
believes it is significant and hopes that it will augur well 
for Spain-U.S. relations.  It is only one step in the right 
direction, but an important one.

SUBJECT: VP SOLBES SAYS BUSINESS RELATIONS WITH U.S. CRUCIAL 
 
1. SUMMARY:  AT a June 24 Embassy-hosted lunch, Second Vice 
President and Minister for Economy and Finance Solbes said 
the new Spanish Administration wants to foster U.S.-Spanish 
business relations.  He reiterated his intention to retain 
budget stability and increase productivity while devolving 
more spending decisions to Spain\'s 16 autonomous regions.  He 
told the group that while he may not always win in 
interministerial battles, he is satisfied thus far and 
intends to stay in his position for his four-year term.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
2. On June 24, Ambassador Argyros hosted a lunch in honor of 
Pedro Solbes, Second Vice President and Minister for Economy 
and Finance.  Over 30 CEOs from American and Spanish 
businesses were invited to hear Solbes\' briefing on the 
overall economic situation in Spain.  Describing business 
relations with the United States as \"crucial,\" Solbes said 
his goal was to reduce obstacles that impede foreign direct 
investment (FDI) and to bring more companies to Spain.  He 
applauded cooperative efforts by regulatory agencies on both 
sides of the Atlantic, and underscored the positive impact of 
U.S. businesses in Spain, estimating they employ 170,000 
Spaniards.  Additionally, Solbes said Spanish businesses see 
the United States as an excellent market for their goods and 
services. 
 
3. Minister Solbes brushed off one participant\'s concerns 
regarding anti-U.S. electoral statements made by Spanish 
government officials.  He told the group that many things are 
said during political campaigns, but it should now be clear 
that the new GOS administration is working towards improving 
relations with both European friends and the United States. 
Solbes later added that Europe is not the United States, and 
while Europe is interested in coordinating with the United 
States, in some areas Europe will always be different.  He 
cited the Financial Services Action Plan as an area where he 
had \"deep conviction\" that it is not possible for Europe to 
do exactly the same as the United States. 
 
4. Solbes also briefed the group on the lines of action of 
the new GOS administration.  Acknowledging that the previous 
government had left the economy in relatively good shape, 
Solbes said he would try to build on areas that were already 
going well.  He stressed the importance of budget stability 
saying that while discretionary fiscal policy for a certain 
amount of time can be acceptable, the GOS will be moderate in 
its spending so that it is able to meet future obligations 
including pensions.  The new team is very committed to 
increasing productivity, and will also focus on policies that 
increase capital flows into Spain and provide incentives for 
innovative and high-tech investments.  Solbes also made 
specific mention of competition policy, saying more attention 
needs to be paid to anti-trust issues in Spain. 
 
5. The minister was candid with the group when a participant 
asked if the Ministry of Economy was able to stand firm on 
spending when other ministries had competing interests. 
Solbes responded that while he might not be perfectly happy 
with all the decisions made by the GOS, he would definitely 
be happy enough to stay in his position for four years. 
 
6. One of the businessmen asked Solbes to consider a 
\"Marshall Plan\" to boost R&D in Spain.  Solbes said more 
public money for R&D is not the solution, better management 
and coordination is.  He also signaled that the new 
government will delegate more spending decisions to the 
regions.  He said that in the last Aznar administration, 
regions received 20% of the budget; today with the transfer 
of education and health spending to the regions, the regions 
get 35%.  He lamented that not all regions are able to take 
responsibility and some have a history of turning to the 
central government for help.  He summed up the relationship 
as, \"We legislate responsibility to them and they ask for 
money.\" 
 
7. During the lunch Solbes also took the opportunity to 
comment on the economic situation in general.  He said it was 
clear that the global economy was recovering with the United 
States as the engine of growth.  While he acknowledged that 
European growth was significantly slower than U.S. growth, he 
boasted that Spain was better off than its European 
neighbors, with its strong capital formation and its 
estimated GDP growth of 2.8%.  Solbes listed inflation and 
the energy intensity of Spanish industry as two key weak 
points in the Spanish economy.  He lamented that oil, with 
its escalating prices, continues to play such a crucial role 
in the overall economy. 
 
8. COMMENT: Solbes was gracious in accepting the Ambassador\'s 
invitation to speak at this \"off the record\" lunch, was 
generous with his time and candid in his remarks.  He gave 
the impression that he is capable and confident in his role 
as manager of Spain\'s budget and economy.  During the lunch 
Solbes gave the assembled American and Spanish CEO\'s a clear 
message that the new administration is pro-business, 
favorably inclined towards U.S. investors, and intent on 
maintaining the budgetary stability and economic growth of 
the previous administration.  He is clearly popular with the 
business community --- the luncheon participants 
spontaneously burst into applause when he declared his 
intention to stay on as Vice President and Minister for his 
full term.

SUBJECT: SPAIN:  MARINE SECURITY PROGRAMS 
 
REF: STATE 85792 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  Per reftel request, we interviewed Spanish 
officials regarding marine security programs.  No single GOS 
agency is responsible for marine security.  Each regional 
port authority is responsible to assure that ports in its 
jurisdiction comply with International Ship and Port 
Facilities Code (ISPS) protocol.  Ports of State (or Puertos 
de Estado), loosely affiliated with the Ministry of Public 
Works, has been helping ready applicable ports for ISPS 
compliance, although it is not directly responsible for any 
port security issues.  Contacts from the Ports of State 
informed us that they were confident preparations for the 1 
July deadline would be met, and that they believe the state 
of port security in Spain is generally higher than in most 
European ports due to Spain,s experience with homegrown 
terrorist groups.  Spain,s Merchant Marine is responsible 
for ISPS and Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regulations for 
applicable ships.  Additionally, the USG and GOS are 
collaborating on several security initiatives.  The 
Department of Energy\'s (DOE) Megaports Initiative continues 
to progress, with a DOE team arriving for a familiarization 
tour of the Port of Algeciras in late July.  The Container 
Security Initiative will begin implementation in late July as 
well when a USG-owned scanner will be lent to the GOS for use 
in Algeciras.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SPAIN,S ISPS PLANS:  PORT FACILITIES 
 
2.  The ports of Spain are implementing a series of port 
security measures to comply with the ISPS.  According to 
Pedro Roman, Safety and Security Department Manager of 
Infrastructures and Port Services Directorate, the ISPS code 
only applies to 50 port facilities in Spain, known as Ports 
of General Interest (or Puertos de Interes General).  They 
are designated as such because of their international 
importance or volume of traffic.  Ports of General Interest 
are overseen by the Ports of State of Spain through 27 
regional port authorities.  According to Roman, only those 
Ports of General Interest that receive ships carrying loads 
greater than 500 gross tons and/or receive any international 
passengers must comply with the ISPS.  Each regional port 
authority (and not the Ports of State) is directly 
responsible for assuring compliance by all ports within its 
jurisdiction.  Roman reiterated that Spain\'s ports do not 
have a true centralized management structure.  Because of 
this fact, there is no fully-coordinated port facilities 
security plan. The individual port authorities will develop 
their own security plans within the context of the ISPS code. 
 
3.  The ports that are not Ports of General Interest are 
known as Autonomous Ports (or Puertos Autonomos).  They 
answer to the Ministry of Public Administration.  Autonomous 
Ports are generally not involved in international trade, with 
the exception of specialized businesses such as shipment of 
salt to France and Italy.  They mostly service local fishing, 
transportation, or commercial activities.  Per Roman, these 
ports are not required to comply with ISPS, and are not being 
briefed on its requirements. 
 
4.  In an attempt to guide ISPS compliance efforts, Ports of 
State has outlined the following steps necessary for 
compliance to ISPS requirements for each Port of General 
Interest: 
 
-- Designate a port security officer, who must pass a course 
on port installation security given by Ports of State, 
-- Create a port facilities security plan.  The regional port 
authority that has jurisdiction over a specific port is 
responsible for reviewing and approving its port facilities 
security plan, and 
-- Ports of State will evaluate each port, using a 
computerized port security program that is currently under 
development.  This computer program is based on US Coast 
Guard port security methodologies and relevant regulations. 
Eventually, a classified port security computer network, 
based on this evaluation program, will link all 
ISPS-compliant Spanish ports. 
 
5.  Contacts from Ports of State were confident that 
applicable ports would be ready to begin compliance 
procedures for the 1 July deadline.  Mr. Roman views this 
deadline, however, as the date by which all of the ports 
would start their preparations for ISPS compliance and not 
necessarily be fully compliant with ISPS protocol.  According 
to the President of the Ports of State Mariano Navas, 
preparations for ISPS compliance have been easier for Spanish 
ports than other European ports, because of their already 
heightened awareness of terrorist issues.  Nationalist 
terrorism has been a threat in Spain since the 1970\'s, from 
Basque separatist terror organizations.  Due to this ongoing 
threat, the Spanish have protected their ports more than 
other European countries, said Navas.  Nevertheless, Spanish 
ports still lack the equipment and training to combat nuclear 
threats or track the shipment of illegally transported 
nuclear materials. 
 
SPAIN,S ISPS PLANS:  VESSELS 
 
6.  Spain,s Merchant Marine is responsible for the security 
of ships at sea and notification of cargo and personnel.  As 
with the Ports of State, the Merchant Marine is nominally 
connected to the Ministry of Public Works. Per Roman, the 
Merchant Marine will adapt its systems to comply with 
chapters 5 and 11 of ISPS requirements on the automatic 
identification system for ships.  The Merchant Marine will 
use these guidelines to check cargo and passengers, first by 
use of a physical logbook, then by a computer system to be 
installed at a later date. 
 
MEGAPORTS INITIATIVE 
 
7.  The implementation of the Department of Energy\'s (DOE) 
Megaports Initiative should increase Spain\'s ability to 
protect against illegal shipment of nuclear or radioactive 
material usable for terrorism by way of commercial traffic. 
We are expecting a team from the DOE to arrive in mid-July 
for a familiarization tour of the Port of Algeciras, where 
the DOE is planning to install Megaports equipment and train 
personnel.  The Megaports Initiative Memorandum of Agreement 
should be signed in late July, with a detailed technical 
inspection and planning visit to Algeciras in late September 
or early October. 
 
CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE (CSI) 
 
8.  Progress was made in early July when the GOS agreed to 
accept the loan of a particular scanner for activation of the 
CSI program in Algeciras.  Various Department of Homeland 
Security personnel are expected to arrive in Spain in late 
July to participate in CSI,s Algeciras implementation. 
Progress has been extremely slow, however, on the GOS tender 
for purchase of a scanner for CSI.  Ports of State President 
Navas (who only recently has taken office), said that his 
organization is still determining the best specifications for 
Spanish ports. 
 
9.  COMMENT:  Roman, the Safety and Security Manager of the 
Ports of Spain admitted to being almost exhausted from the 
effort that he has undertaken in moving Spain,s Ports of 
General Interest toward compliance with ISPS.  His 
description of processes, and his clear delineation of his 
responsibilities from those of other port authorities, made 
it seem that he was looking forward to the completion of his 
part of the ISPS implementation program.  Additionally, 
President Navas seemed interested in resolving the problems 
surrounding procurement of scanners and training.  We hope to 
see movement on the tender by early autumn.  End Comment.

MEETING

.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Spain sees the EU-ASEM summit in danger over 
the insistence of Asian nations to include Burma as a full 
member.  The GOS supports the opening of an EC office in 
Baghdad and stresses the importance of holding at least one 
of the two planned elections in Afghanistan this Fall.  On 
the Venezuela recall referendum, Spain says that the EU has 
not been invited to observe and will not fund an OAS mission, 
but that Spain is willing to provide funding for OAS 
observers. End summary. 
 
2. (C) We delivered reftel demarche on July 9 to Enrique 
Mora, Director of the MFA\'s Office of EU Foreign Policy and 
Common Security.  We reiterated our opposition to the EU\'s 
lifting of its arms embargo on China, stressing our deep 
concern about regional security issues and again pointing to 
China\'s problematic human rights record.  We also noted 
information on the types of weaponry that have been provided 
by EU countries to China even with the embargo in place. 
Mora had no new comment on this issue. 
 
3. (C) Regarding relations with Asia, Mora stated that the 
upcoming EU-ASEM summit was indeed in danger of being 
cancelled.  He said that two minor EU-ASEM meetings (Economic 
and Finance-related, he believed) had already been suspended 
because of ASEM\'s insistence on full membership for Burma. 
Mora said that the EU had proposed allowing Burma to attend 
at a status less than that of a member state, but that the 
Asian countries had rejected the offer and continue to 
threaten to deny membership for the 10 new EU nations if 
Burma is not admitted. 
 
4. (C) On Iraq, Mora stated that Spain favors the opening of 
an EC office in Baghdad and that they continue to be 
interested in training Iraqi police.  He did mention, though, 
that they envision this training to occur in Spain (possibly 
at their police academy in Avila), rather than in Iraq. 
 
5. (C) On the subject of Venezuela, Mora said that the EU had 
not been invited to send an observer team.  He also stated 
that though the EU would not be providing funding for an OAS 
observer mission, Spain is willing to provide funding. 
 
6. (C) Regarding Afghanistan, he said that there was little 
chance of creating an OSCE election observation mission until 
the security situation improves.  On the subject of the 
elections, he emphasized that Spain understands if the Karzai 
government needs to push back the presidential elections to 
2005, but that the parliamentary elections need to be held 
this September or October.  Mora said that Spain feels that 
having both elections postponed would send an unacceptable 
message and strengthen the Taliban\'s position.

1. (C) We delivered reftel demarche on July 6 to Enrique 
Mora, Director of the MFA\'s Office of EU Foreign Policy and 
Common Security.  Mora was not able to give an immediate 
reaction, but later spoke to Poloff on July 9.  He stated 
that Spain and the EU share the general concern with the USG 
regarding the human rights situation in Syria.  Mora said 
that the EU would deliver a demarche to the Syria government 
either on July 13 or 14 requesting that Syria clarify their 
reasons for detaining persons mentioned in our talking points. 
 
2. (C) Mora said that the EU was still looking for a Syrian 
official who could accept the demarche. He said that Syrian 
officials and diplomats are often reluctant to accept 
negative messages, as they can face retribution from the 
higher levels of the Syrian government.  Mora stated that 
while the EU does not believe that President Bashar al-Assad 
is likely to support democracy or radical changes in the 
Syrian regime, he is better than his father.  Mora said that 
the EU sees a reformist faction in Syria and hopes to 
approach the Syrian human rights situation in a manner that 
advances the reformers. 
 
3. (C) We also delivered the demarche to Juan Manuel Cabrera, 
Director of the MFA\'s Office of Human Rights on July 6. 
Cabrera had no comment at that time and we will report any 
response we receive in the future.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN-UK: GIBRALTAR VISIT BY UK NUCLEAR SUB 
STRAINS RELATIONS 
 
1. (U) The visit by the British nuclear submarine HMS 
Tireless to Gibraltar has provoked acute tension within the 
GOS towards Britain.  The HMS Tireless, which arrived the 
morning of July 9, originally sparked controversy in May 2000 
when it docked at Gibraltar for repairs after developing a 
crack in the cooling system of its reactor and leaking a 
small quantity of contaminated water into the Mediterranean. 
 
2.  (U) Press accounts in Spain quote the British government 
as saying that the current visit is routine and planned to 
last 4 to 6 days.  The British Foreign Office is further 
quoted in the Spanish press as stating that \"the HMS 
Tireless, like any other Royal Navy ship, is entitled to use 
Gibraltar port facilities\". 
 
3. (U) The visit, however, has apparently been anything but 
routine on the Spanish side.  Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel 
Angel Moratinos called the visit an \"unacceptable 
provocation\" and \"unfriendly act\" and said that it is the 
latest in a series of \"unfriendly\" British acts since the new 
Socialist government took power in April.  Spain had 
protested in June the attendance of Britain\'s Princess Anne 
at ceremonies marking the 300th anniversary of the capture of 
Gibraltar by an Anglo-Dutch force.  Reports say that the GOS 
summoned the British Ambassador in Madrid, Stephen Wright, to 
the MFA twice in the last week to protest the visit of the 
HMS Tireless, with MFA State Secretary Bernadino Leon using 
the latest visit to convey the \"displeasure and profound ill 
feeling of the Spanish government given the lack of British 
sensitivity toward Spanish public opinion\". 
 
4. (U) While the MFA did state that Spain will continue to 
consider the United Kingdom a friend and ally, it will 
\"evaluate and examine\" recent British actions and consider 
what the \"impacts on our relations with Great Britain will be 
if we continue to see that it does not heed the requests of a 
friendly country\".  The Spanish Socialist Party\'s Secretary 
for International Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, is quoted as 
reminding \"the friendly government of the United Kingdom, 
that is should take good care of the bilateral relationship\" 
because \"nothing is free in diplomacy\". 
 
5. (U) Smaller political parties in Spain also indicated 
their displeasure at the visit and called for various actions 
in response.  The Andalusian Party (PA) called for a revision 
of Andalusia\'s Autonomous Province Statute to include an 
explicit reference to Gibraltar as \"Andalusian territory\" and 
calling for Gibraltar to be declared a non-nuclear zone.  The 
United Left (Communist) Party also presented measures in 
parliament proposing that the entire Mediterranean be 
declared a non-nuclear zone and calling on the Spanish 
government to declare if it has an \"Emergency Plan\" in place 
in case of nuclear accidents in Gibraltar. 
 
6. (U) Moratinos is expected to meet with British Foreign 
Secretary Jack Straw on July 12 to discuss Gibraltar while 
 
SIPDIS 
both are in Brussels for the July 12-13 GAERC meetings.  He 
reportedly will use the opportunity to not only express 
Spanish disapproval of the HMS Tireless visit, but to also 
press for restarting discussions on the future of Gibraltar\'s 
sovereignty.

and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide

ICJ RULING; SUPPORT FOR US EFFORT IN SUDAN

Classified By: Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick, Political Counselor. 
Reasons: 1.4 B/D 
 
-------- 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1. (C)  The GOS is pursuing a new \"approach\" to resolve 
the crisis in the Western Sahara but its elements remain 
unclear, according to the newly appointed MFA Director 
General for the Mediterranean, Near East, and Africa, 
Alvaro Iranzo.  The Spanish Deputy Foreign Minister is 
in the process of discussing the new approach with parties 
in the region, and with France, and would like to share 
his view with senior NEA officials.  Iranzo was non- 
committal on the UNGA resolution on the ICJ.  Subsequent 
discussions with the MFA indicate that FM Moratinos, 
who has been in Brussels, has not yet decided on the 
issue. On Sudan, the GOS is likely to support a 
strong UNSC resolution and an EU statement on the 
Darfur crisis.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (C)  PolCouns met July 12 with newly appointed Director 
General of Foreign Policy for the Mediterranean, Near East, 
and Africa Alvaro Iranzo Gutierrez to exchange views on the 
Western Sahara, the ICJ ruling, and Spain\'s Africa policy. 
Iranzo has considerable experience in Africa and the Middle 
East.  He served in Gabon (1981), Mozambique (1983), and 
Algeria (1989).  In 1992, he was a deputy director of 
Bureau of North African affairs under current Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, who was director general 
of the bureau then.  Iranzo was an assistant to Moratinos 
when Moratinos was the EU\'s Special Representative to the 
Middle East Process in 1996.  Later, Iranzo was Spain\'s 
ambassador to Angola (1997) and Malaysia (2001) before 
assuming his current position. 
 
--------------------------- 
Spain\'s Middle East Posture 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (C)  Iranzo told us that Spain will taken an active 
approach on the Middle East given FM Moratinos experience 
in the region as an EU envoy.  Spain maintains close 
relations to the Arab world, especially Morocco, and has 
good relations with Israel.  On Morocco, Iranzo noted that 
despite press reports, the GOS is not threatened by 
Morocco\'s Major non-NATO Ally Status and the free trade 
agreement with the U.S.  Both Spain and the U.S. are 
interested in regional stability, and \"what\'s good for 
Morocco is good for Spain,\" Iranzo remarked.  He affirmed 
that despite previously tumultuous relations with Algeria, 
Spain now has good relations with Algeria  (Note: President 
Zapatero will make a one-day State visit to Algeria July 
14. End Note.)  Overall, the Arab world sees Spain, and 
especially Foreign Minister Moratinos, as a credible 
interlocutor in the Middle East Process and the Western 
Sahara, Iranzo said. 
 
-------------- 
Western Sahara 
-------------- 
 
4. (C)  Noting recent press statement by Moratinos, 
PolCouns asked whether the new Spanish government had 
adopted a new policy on the Western Sahara.  Iranzo 
responded by expressing support for the broad outline of 
the Baker Plan but said Spain is seeking a new \"approach\" 
to overcome the impasse over the issue of the Polisario 
referendum.  When PolCouns pressed for specific details, 
Iranzo admitted that there were no specific plans.  He said 
Spain\'s initiative would deal with \"methodology\" rather 
than final outcomes.  Iranzo also said that the new UN 
envoy for the Western Sahara, De Soto, did not have the 
stature to move the process forward.  However, according to 
Iranzo, Spain wants to be more involved in pressing for a 
solution in the Western Sahara acceptable to all parties. 
Spain wants to convince the Polisario to be more flexible, 
to persuade France and the U.S. to be more consensual, and 
to avoid a UN-imposed solution. 
 
5. (C) Iranzo acknowledged that Spain\'s new approach 
carries international and domestic risks.  President 
Zapatero, Minister Moratinos, and State Secretary for 
Foreign Policy Bernardino Leon have been consulting with 
France, Morocco, Algeria, and the Polisario on the Western 
Sahara issue.  Iranzo said that the GOS is concerned that 
failure in the Western Sahara would jeopardize the MINURSO 
mandate, radicalize Moroccans, and possibly increase 
illegal immigration and terrorism in Spain.  He said that 
State Secretary Leon wants to meet with senior NEA 
officials to discuss Spain\'s approach in the Western Sahara 
in the near future. 
------------------------------ 
Spain and the ICJ Court Ruling 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) PolCouns reviewed ref (a) points on the 
International Court of Justice\'s (ICJ) ruling on the 
Israeli security barrier with Iranzo (meeting took place 
before the draft resolution had been put forth, and before 
the receipt of ref (b) demarche). Iranzo said that although 
Israel had the right to defend itself against terrorism, it 
also has to consider how its policies affect Palestinians 
and must listen to the international community.  The 
security barrier is being constructed in Palestinian 
territory, and the recent Israeli Supreme Court ruling may 
only change on a small portion of the barrier, Iranzo 
argued.  Nevertheless, Palestinian leadership must be held 
responsible for actions that are contrary to the Road Map. 
The ICJ ruling shows, however, that Israel has few friends 
in the world, Iranzo said. 
 
7. (C)  Iranzo did not commit to a position on the new UNGA 
resolution on the ICJ decision.  (FYI: Spain under the 
Aznar government abstained on the December 2003 UNGA 
resolution remanding the case to the ICJ.) Iranzo indicated, 
however, that Spain would not want to be seen objecting to 
a near-unanimous decision by the ICJ.  Iranzo said Spain 
respects the ICJ decision and wants to be constructive and 
seek common ground on the issue at the UN.  The MFA is 
discussing the issue with the Israel\'s ambassador in Spain 
and with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv.  Iranzo promised to 
communicate our message directly to Minister Moratinos. 
Subsequent discussions with the MFA indicate Moratinos, who 
has been traveling, has not yet decided on the issue 
(septel). 
 
--------------- 
Spain and Sudan 
--------------- 
 
8. (C)  PolCouns thanked Iranzo for Spain\'s support for USG 
efforts in Sudan, and delivered the importance of Secretary 
Powell\'s visit there.  Iranzo told us that Spain wants to 
help define the terms of the Darfur resolution in the UN in 
the interest of securing peace in Sudan.  He was concerned 
that applying sanctions on the Jinjaweit militias would be 
difficult because the leaders are not easily identifiable. 
However, Spain would support a UNSC resolution on Darfur 
that puts pressure on the Government of Sudan to disarm the 
militias and allow humanitarian aid workers access to 
refugees.  Iranzo said that Spain has also been involved in 
helping draft a strong EU statement on Sudan. 
 
9. (C)  Noting the USG\'s broad, multilateral approach to 
the resolution of conflicts in Africa and dealing with 
global challenges such as combating HIV/AIDS, PolCouns 
shared a copy of Secretary Powell\'s July 8, 2004 speech 
outlining the USG\'s approach on key Africa issues.  Iranzo 
said that he had not seen the speech and was grateful to 
receive it. 
 
10. (C)  Iranzo said that Spain also supports a multi- 
lateral approach to African issues given the small size of 
its missions on the continent.  Having served as ambassador 
to Angola, Iranzo told us that Spain has maintained 
comprehensive relations with southern Africa and Spanish 
and Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa.  He said that 
Spain\'s major issue in Africa is illegal immigration. 
Bilateral agreements to control illegal immigration between 
African countries and Spain have had little success, Iranzo 
said.  Nevertheless, the GOS will continue to engage 
African countries on issues such as immigration, democracy 
building, and human rights.  Iranzo stated that on these 
issues the U.S. and Spain share a strong common interest.

REASONS 1.4 (B)/(D) 
 
(C)  Reftel explained that Spain will increase its aid pledge 
to Darfur and support a strong EU statement on the crisis. 
We have since learned that Spain will support the U.S. 
proposed draft UNSC resolution on Darfur.  On July 11, we 
spoke with the Deputy Director General of UN Affairs, Juan 
Manuel Linares.  Linares told us that Spain would support the 
UNSC resolution but questioned how sanctions could be applied 
to the Jinjaweit since their leaders are not readily 
identifiable and they do not have any outside arms routes or 
bank accounts on which sanctions could be placed.  Linares 
said he would like to see this aspect clarified before the 
draft resolution is adopted.  Spain will continue to support 
keeping the pressure on the government of Sudan which, Spain 
believes, is supplying arms to the militia.

3.  Visitors are reminded that bearers of diplomatic and 
official passports coming to Spain on official business need 
to obtain a Spanish visa prior to arrival in Spain. 
 
4.  THREAT ASSESSMENT: 
 
In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel/state.gov.  In addition to information on the 
Internet, U.S. travelers can hear recorded information by 
calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at 
202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, or receive 
information by automated telefax by dialing 202-647-3000 from

(C) We spoke with both Juan Manuel Cabrera, Director of the 
MFA\'s Office of Human Rights, and to Enrique Mora, Director 
of the MFA\'s Office of EU Foreign Policy and Common Security, 
regarding reftel.  Both agreed with our position that the 
Cuban resolution was merely an attempt to politically target 
coalition countries and that they viewed the resolution as a 
reaction to the condemnations Cuba has received in the Human 
Rights Commission.  Mora stated that Spain would work to 
oppose the resolution.

1. (C) We delivered reftel A demarche to Juan Manuel Linares, 
MFA Deputy DG for UN Affairs, on July 13 and to Alberto 
Moreno, MFA Deputy DG for Middle East Affairs, on July 14. 
Both stated that they could not commit to a position on the 
proposed UNGA resolution, as the EU had not yet decided on a 
common policy, but that the GOS\'s inclination was to abstain. 
 Both also mentioned that a final decision would have to wait 
until FM Moratinos returned from the EU Foreign Ministers\' 
meeting in Brussels.  (Before receipt of reftel A, we had 
raised our concerns with Alvaro Iranzo, the new MFA Director 
General for the Middle East and North Africa - see reftel B) 
 
2. (C) Linares stated that he personally sees the Palestinian 
resolution as \"unhelpful\" to the peace process and Road Map. 
He added that Spain would like to see the issue go away 
before it reaches the UN Security Council, as it would most 
likely be addressed in September when Spain has the UNSC 
presidency. They would prefer the issue not come up on their

Classified By: Political Counselor Katherine M. Fitzpatrick, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Ref A sought post\'s view on the likelihood the GOS or 
Spanish NGOs would participate in outreach to Cuban civil 
society to pressure the Castro government to hasten 
democratic transition on the island.  We discussed Cuba with 
new MFA Director General for Latin America Sandomingo (Ref 
B).  The GOS will maintain a firm stand on Cuba but will not 
actively work in the EU for a tougher line.  The GOS is 
prepared to normalize dialogue provided the Castro regime 
takes positive steps showing dialogue would yield results, 
but the GOS does not expect this to happen and therefore will 
not do so.  However, the GOS wants to open lines of 
communication with the Cuban government.  Given this stance, 
it is post\'s judgment that the Zapatero government will not 
be receptive to entreaties to engage in the activities 
outlined by ref A to pressure the Cuban government further. 
Nonetheless, the Foreign Ministry\'s Director General for 
Latin America, Francisco Javier Sandomingo, will be visiting 
with A/S Noriega and others Monday, July 19.  His visit 
provides an opportunity to sound out the Foreign Ministry 
further on its approach to Cuba. 
 
2.  (C) Spain-based NGOs tend to be left leaning and while 
they may favor dialogue with civil society, they are not 
likely to favor activities that could be seen as designed to 
pressure the Castro regime further.  However, the principal 
opposition Popular Party may be more amenable to engaging in 
the type of activities envisioned by ref A.  The party\'s 
international affairs chief, Jorge Moragas, traveled to Cuba 
July 13-17 to meet with Cuban dissidents, NGOs and the 
Catholic Church.

SUBJECT: SPAIN: GUANTANAMO DETAINEE RELEASED ON BAIL 
 
 
Classified By: CHG J. ROBERT MANZANARES, REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
1.  (C) Legat and other agencies have met and consulted at 
length on the release on bail July 13 of Hamed Abderrahman 
Ahmed.  While there is disappointment within the rank and 
file of the Spanish National Police, they emphasize that it 
was a provisional release on bail.   Prosecutorial Magistrate 
Baltasar Garzon has not dropped the case.   He set the bail 
low, however, at 3,000 euros.  The police emphasize that 
Abderrahman is required to report on a daily basis to his 
local police headquarters and on a weekly basis to the 
courts.   The police continue to collect evidence.   As with 
other al Qaeda related cases (such as the al Qaeda cell led 
by Eddin Barakat Yarkas who was arrested in November 2001 and 
is still awaiting trial), a trial would likely not take place 
for several years. 
 
2. (C) The Department asked whether the USG had an 
arrangement with the Government of Spain that the USG would 
release Abderrahman to the Spanish only if they prosecuted 
him.   The USG did not premise the transfer specifically on 
an agreement to prosecute; though the USG emphasized to the 
USG our understanding he would be prosecuted, the Spanish 
government does not have authority over the Spanish court 
system or its magistrates.   In seeking Abderrahman\'s 
transfer, the MFA did tell us formally that he was sought by 
Spanish courts under the charge of membership in a terrorist 
organization. 
 
3. (C) Comment: Garzon is an outspoken critic of the US 
policy on Guantanamo detainees.   He is also the Spanish 
judiciary\'s most aggressive investigator of al Qaeda-related 
terrorists, having indicted over thirty, twelve of whom are 
in custody.   While bail for Abderrahman is low, the 
provisions of reporting daily to a police station are 
stringent by Spanish standards.   The media report that 
Abderrahman will live in his native Ceuta.   Regardless of 
Garzon\'s discomfort with Guantanamo, we expect that he will 
not drop the case if he has solid evidence against 
Abderrahman to present to the prosecutor.   The Spanish media 
have tended to portray Abderrahman as a victim of the US and 
skirt over or ignore his previous residence in Afghanistan 
and al Qaeda connections.

SUBJECT: SPAIN UNVEILS NATIONAL KYOTO PLAN 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  In an eleventh hour move to avoid EU penalties, 
Spain\'s Ministries of Environment and Industry unveiled the 
provisional National Allocation Plan (NAP) on 7 July.  The 
NAP is the GOS attempt to bring domestic carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions in line with the first tranche of the Kyoto 
Protocol.  The GOS was particularly concerned about the 
Spanish energy sector, with its high number of coal-powered 
plants and how to control CO2 emissions without causing 
capacity cuts or price hikes.  Spain will need new investment 
in power plants and should improve importation infrastructure 
in order to meet demand for electricity.  The new socialist 
government (PSOE) blames the former People\'s Party (PP) 
government for not negotiating with enough foresight to see 
that Spain\'s rapid GDP growth and industrial output would 
also increase its emissions. END SUMMARY. 
 
EMISSIONS PLAN PUBLISHED 
------------------------ 
 
2.  Spain\'s Ministries of Environment and Industry presented 
the provisional draft of the National Allocation Plan (NAP) 
on 7 July.  The NAP outlines the level of carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions that certain sectors of the economy will be 
allowed to produce between the years 2005 and 2007, as 
mandated by the Kyoto Protocol.  The EU threatened to take 
Spain and a handful of other EU countries to the European 
Court of Justice for delaying the rollout of their NAPs.  GOS 
officials sped up analysis and drafting of the NAP to avoid 
EU reprimand at the last minute.  The Ministries of 
Environment and Industry led the task of permit allocation to 
the petroleum refinement, steel, cement, industrial ceramics, 
paper, and energy sectors.  The NAP does not cover the 
transportation, agriculture, chemical, services, non-iron ore 
metals, residential, or other industrial services emissions, 
but later rounds will restrict CO2 and other emissions 
generated by these sectors.  The GOS will distribute CO2 
emissions permits based on sectoral projections that account 
for future capital and existing plants in the industries, 
except in the special case of the energy sector.  The 
Ministry of Environment created a formula for Kyoto 
compliance that accounts for future growth and historical 
emissions from power plants in a way that that maintains a 
competitive sector and assures a sufficient energy supply. 
 
ALLOCATIONS 
----------- 
 
3.  The Kyoto Protocol uses 1990 CO2 emissions levels as its 
base year measurement.  Spain\'s total allotment of 161.25 
million tons of CO2 emissions is a 15% increase over 1990 
levels.  Last year\'s CO2 emissions levels summed to more than 
40% over (402.7 million tons) 1990 totals.  The GOS\'s 2012 
target is to bring CO2 emissions down to 24% over 1990 
totals.  Individual firms with excess emissions, mostly in 
the energy sector, will buy CO2 emissions credits in the 
European CO2 Emissions Market that is scheduled to open in 
January 2005.  The GOS hopes that replacement of older 
capital with new cleaner technology will eliminate these 
excesses in the long run.  Spain will also receive an extra 3 
million tons of CO2 credits from Kyoto provisions for forest 
lands and their conversion of greenhouse gases into oxygen. 
This equates to a 2% cushion that effectively increases the 
15% limit over 1990 figures to 17%. 
 
4.  The emissions breakdown per sector is as follows: 
 
SECTOR:                       TOTAL EMISSIONS: 
Petrol. Refinement            15.97 million tons 
Steel                         11.94 
Cement and Calcium            30.04 
Glass and Ind. Ceramics 11.12 
Paper                         5.35 
Reserve                       0.43 
TOTAL INDUSTRIAL              74.85 
 
Energy                              86.40 
TOTAL (energy   ind.)         161.25 
 
5.  We met with Teresa Rivera, General Manager of the Office 
of Climate Change of the Ministry of Environment, who gave us 
details regarding the development of the NAP.  She said that 
since May 25, GOS officials working on Kyoto had redoubled 
their efforts to complete Spain\'s NAP.  An interministerial 
committee led by the Ministry of Environment and made up of 
assistant secretary-level officials from affected Spanish 
ministries, such as the Ministries of Environment, Industry, 
and Economy, met weekly to work out the details of Spain\'s 
NAP.  A working-level group from the same ministries met more 
frequently.  These groups consulted regularly with industry 
experts and the autonomous regional governments.  Rivera 
noted that the PP government had organized a working group 
that laid the groundwork for Kyoto compliance, but seemed 
reluctant to go further.  A steel industry contact told us 
that during the PP administration, GOS officials promised 
industry leaders they would have all of the emissions permits 
they asked for and were very concerned about Kyoto in the run 
up to the campaign in March.  He told us that PP officials 
asked the industry not to talk with the press.  Contacts in 
the chemical industry claim that PP administration officials 
told them privately that Spain would not comply with Kyoto. 
Nevertheless, the research and analysis from the previous 
administration allowed the current PSOE administration to act 
quickly.  The new government, acting on its campaign pledge, 
pulled together all of the pieces necessary to enact Kyoto 
legislation in two months. 
INDUSTRY IS PLEASED BUT HESITANT 
-------------------------------- 
6.  The industrial sectors (ie. refineries, steel cement, 
ceramics and paper) made out well in this first tranche of 
Kyoto, receiving on average about 97% of the emissions 
permits they requested from the GOS.  Our steel sector 
contact said this was in recognition of the fact that all of 
the sectors except for energy had little room to maneuver 
because their production processes could not change, 
therefore their CO2 emissions were more or less fixed.  He 
said industry is concerned the next round will not be so 
pleasant.  Energy took the real blow, despite the fact that 
the sector received half of all NAP emissions allowances. 
 
THE TROUBLES WITH ENERGY 
------------------------ 
 
7.  The NAP Interministerial Committee found Spain\'s energy 
sector to be the most troublesome not only because of its 
massive emissions but also because of the threat of lost 
electrical capacity and rate increases.  The provisional NAP 
allocates 86.2 million tons of CO2 permits, more than 
one-half, to the energy sector.  The energy sector is also 
the only one in which the GOS is directly allocating permits 
to firms instead of to the governing sectoral body for later 
allocation to individual firms. 
 
8.  The two largest electricity companies, Endesa and 
Iberdrola, each lobbied for different methods of emissions 
allocation.  Endesa wanted historically-based assignments, 
which would have favored their heavier reliance on coal 
produced electricity.  Iberdrola favored a plan that only 
included projected emissions, because of their use of more 
efficient combined cycle generators.  The NAP council decided 
to distribute emissions credits using a mixed formula.  New 
combined cycle gas plants that meet all regulations to begin 
operations by 2005 will be included in the assignments of CO2 
credits. 
 
 
9.  Coal plants will receive permit assignments according to 
historical data and combined cycle generators will receive 
CO2 credits based on projected emissions.  The Ministry of 
Industry representative on the NAP working group told econoff 
that one of the GOS\'s goals is to eliminate coal produced 
electricity by gradually transitioning into gas-generated 
electricity combined with some imported electricity.  Spanish 
mining companies and workers in northern Spain stand to lose 
out on phased-out coal production along with the U.S., which 
is the largest exporter of coal to Spain.  Electric bills 
will likely also increase, despite the Minister of Industry\'s 
declaration to the press that they should not increase above 
the normal rate. 
 
10.  Jesus Candil, Director General for Industrial 
Development in the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and 
Commerce, informed us that Spain needs to increase capacity 
to connect with foreign sources of electrical capacity in 
order to be flexible and to meet future demand and Kyoto 
requirements.  He said that Spain is \"electrically an island 
in Europe,\" with almost zero trade in electricity between it 
and the rest of the EU.  He went on to say that the GOS goal 
is to increase its electricity import capacity to 10% of 
demand. He hastened to add that Spain did not need to import 
the electricity, but should develop the capability to do so 
in the event that it is necessary.  The GOS recently approved 
a gas and electrical pipeline between Algeria and Spain. 
This pipeline will partially accommodate Spain\'s growing 
electricity demand through both increased gas supplies and 
direct importation of electrical power from Algeria-based 
power plants.  But both Rivera and Candil concurred that the 
energy sector needs to augment its production ability with 
new capital, which is expected to solely come through private 
investment. 
 
THE ROAD AHEAD 
-------------- 
 
11.  The NAP Interministerial Committee is now drafting the 
royal decree to legally enact the NAP.  Our contacts predict 
that the Council of Ministers will pass NAP legislation on 
July 30.  Teresa Rivera commented that drafting the final 
plan took two months of intense work, but they are finding 
enacting it will be even more difficult.  The GOS must now 
form some kind of regulatory body, distribute permits, 
monitor for excess gas emissions, and enforce the NAP. 
Industry and government leaders are currently discussing 
implications of the NAP in what is known as the period of 
public criticism, although the last draft of the NAP is only 
expected to change negligibly, if at all, before approval by 
the GOS Counsel of Ministers. 
12.  COMMENT: It is unclear whether the previous government 
intended to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.  The PP 
government formed an initial working group to provide 
emissions research, but never moved forward in drafting a 
definitive NAP.  With harsh EU penalties looming it is likely 
that a new PP administration would also have stepped up the 
pace after elections to finish work on the NAP.  The PSOE 
pledged to comply with Kyoto as part of its campaign.  The 
industrial sector fared well in this tranche, while the 
energy sector will need to undergo some restructuring. 
Spanish businesses are concerned that these regulations may 
reduce international competitivity due to higher costs for 
Kyoto-compliant countries vs. non-compliant countries. 
Consumers are concerned that producers will pass along 
increased costs to them.  END COMMENT.

Statement 
 
2.  This appendix serves as an update to the 2003 Investment 
Climate Statement for Spain.  It has been provided to assist 
investors in the interim period resulting from the U.S. 
Government\'s decision to begin publishing the Country 
Commercial Guide (of which the Investment Climate Statement 
is a chapter) on a calendar year basis, in January instead of 
August. 
 
3.  The United States Government has reviewed the 2003 
Investment Climate Statement for Spain, and has noted the 
following changes that have occurred since its publication. 
In most circumstances, if a portion of the 2003 Investment 
Climate Statement has not been modified in this appendix, it 
is because the U.S. Government is satisfied that it continues 
to accurately reflect the state of affairs in Spain. 
 
4.  Openness to Foreign Investment: No significant changes 
since 2003. 
 
Conversion and Transfer Policies: No significant changes 
since 2003. 
 
Expropriation and Compensation: No significant changes since 
2003. 
 
Dispute Settlement: No significant changes since 2003. 
 
Performance Requirements and Incentives: Instead of the 
Ministry of Science and Technology issuing incentives, the 
Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade now issues them. 
 
Right to Private Ownership and Establishment: No significant 
changes since 2003. 
 
Transparency of the Regulatory System: No significant changes 
since 2003. 
 
Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment: CNMV, 
Spain\'s SEC equivalent is leading the effort to develop a 
strong system of corporate governance and transparency.  CNMV 
is hoping to transfer the behavior and traditional habits of 
Spain\'s small universe of dominant companies.  Under the new 
standards, all  companies listed on the Spanish stock 
exchange must publish an annual corporate governance report 
that details their compliance with CNMV\'s best practices or 
explain why they have chosen not to do so.  The government\'s 
\"Golden Share\" takeover veto rights are being phased out due 
to their incompatibility with EU law. 
 
In 2003, new Spanish gross investment abroad was USD 29.5 
billion, showing a significant drop from the 2002 annual 
level of USD 50.5 billion. 
 
Political Violence: On March 11 Islamic extremist terrorists 
attacked Madrid\'s central train station.  The government has 
worked to round up the perpetrators and to monitor the 
situation with respect to Islamic extremist terrorism. 
 
ETA has killed 46 persons since January 2000. 
 
Pro-ETA vandalism has decreased in the last year and a half, 
going from 448 actions in 2002 to 150 in 2003.  As of May 
2004, there were a total of 85 cases of street violence. 
 
Another smaller leftist terrorist group called GRAPO has 
occasionally acted against government interests.  The latest 
action on the part of this group was a bank robbery in June 
2003, from where they took EUR 200,000.  The three people 
involved were arrested in December 2003.  Other arrests and 
prosecution orders on already arrested GRAPO members have 
taken place in the last months. 
 
Corruption: No significant changes since 2003. 
 
Bilateral Investment Agreements: Spain established new 
bilateral investment agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina 
(2003), Federal Republish of Yugoslavia (2004), Guatemala 
(2004), Republic of Albania (2004), Republic of Equatorial 
Guinea (2004), and Republic of Uzbekistan (2004). 
 
OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs: No significant 
changes since 2003. 
Labor: Employment for first quarters of 2004 show that there 
were about 19.6 million Spaniards in the work force. 
Meanwhile, unemployment continued its decrease from the 1994 
high of 24.2 percent down to 11.38 percent in the first 
quarters of 2004.  Unemployment for women continues to be 
substantially higher than the male average, at 15.71 percent 
compared to 8.38 percent. 
 
Labor market reforms in 1994, 1997, and 2002 have eased but 
not fundamentally changed the difficult labor situation, with 
the result that one-third of all employed Spaniards are 
classified as temporary hires.  The government has 
implemented three rounds of reforms to liberalize hiring 
practices and the Congress continues to discuss further labor 
reforms. 
 
Collective bargaining is widespread in both the private and 
public sectors, except for military personnel.  Sixty percent 
of the working population is covered by collective bargaining 
agreements although only a minority (generally estimated to 
be about 15 to 20 percent) are actually union members. 
 
The constitution guarantees the right to strike and it has 
been interpreted to include general strikes called to protest 
government policy.  According to the National Business 
Association, as of June 30, 2003, there had been 275 strikes, 
with approximately 381,000 participants and 1 million lost 
workdays.  The law prohibits retaliation against strikers. 
There were no general strikes during 2003. 
 
Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports: No significant changes since 
2003. 
 
Foreign Direct Investment Statistics: Statistics will be 
updated in the next full version of the Investment Climate 
Statement, which will be published in January 2005. France 
and Sweden invested more in Spain in 2003 than previous years 
and are now considered major foreign investors.

SUBJECT: SPAIN TOYS WITH IDEA OF CULTURAL EXCEPTION 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Spain\'s new Minister of Culture has vowed 
to find ways to help the Spanish film industry.  The press 
has seized on her sometimes over the top remarks and is 
reporting that the GOS is pursuing a policy of cultural 
exception along the lines of the French model.  A high-level 
Ministry of Culture official and contacts in the film 
industry say that press stories are not accurate and that the 
ministry is looking for innovative, but non-discriminatory 
measures to help Spanish film makers.  To this effect, on 
July 9 the Spanish Council of Ministers approved implementing 
legislation that will allow the GOS to collect funds from 
television operators to support the Spanish film industry. 
The Ministry of Culture official in charge of audiovisual 
industry policy has pledged to work with the USG and keep us 
informed of any policies being considered that may impact on 
U.S. industry. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (SBU) Since Spain\'s new socialist (PSOE) government named 
Carmen Calvo as Minister of Culture in May 2004, she has 
shown a knack for breaking new ground and unabashedly 
speaking her mind, usually before consulting within the PSOE 
government or within her own ministry.  In several short 
months she has already had to walk back a number of 
announcements once she discovered that her ministry did not 
have competency to do what she had promised. (One notable 
example was her promise to lower value added tax for CDs and 
DVDs only to discover that the tax levels are determined in 
Brussels.)  Nonetheless, we have watched with special 
interest her pronouncements on her intention to bolster 
Spain\'s cinematography industry.  At a number of film 
industry events, she has repeatedly said that part of her job 
is to bolster the Spanish film industry and ensure that the 
bigger players in the market (read U.S. film studios) don\'t 
push the Spanish industry to the brink.  In a trip to Brazil 
earlier this month, she signed an accord pledging to work 
with Brazil, Algeria, Austria, Mali and Mexico to pursue 
special treatment for cultural diversity in the World Trade 
Organization. 
 
3. (U) Not surprisingly, since Calvo took office, Spanish 
newspapers have carried numerous articles suggesting that the 
new PSOE administration has decided to pursue a policy of 
cultural exception similar to France.  Some articles cast it 
in terms of a battle to protect the Spanish film industry 
from its U.S. counterpart.  While no one seems to have an 
especially clear idea of what a policy of cultural exception 
consists of, uncertainty has not prevented journalists and 
pundits alike from expounding on a variety of policies they 
believe the government is or should be considering.  One 
potential measure mentioned is expanding the screen quota 
beyond the current permitted ratio in Spain of one European 
film for every three foreign films.  Another idea is a 
dubbing tax which would be charged to theaters for carrying 
dubbed films.  Consumer groups in Spain immediately expressed 
their opposition to this idea as they expect that any tax 
will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices 
for foreign films.  Other stories mention dubbing licenses, 
measures that were in place many years ago but removed by a 
previous PSOE administration 8 years ago. 
 
4. (U) On July 8 we met with Manuel Perez Estremera, newly 
named Director General for the Institute of Cinematography at 
the Ministry of Culture.  He reports directly to Minister 
Calvo.  We expressed our concern with the current buzz 
suggesting that Spain was looking at following the French 
lead and pursuing a policy of protection for its film 
industry.  Perez lamented the inaccuracy and in some places 
the complete fiction included in recent press stories.  He 
agreed that Calvo is determined to work in the best interests 
of the Spanish film industry, however he brushed aside the 
suggestions of expanded screen quotas or dubbing taxes or 
licenses.  He underscored that these measures have not even 
been discussed in the ministry. 
 
5. (U) At present, the Ministry\'s main objective is to 
provide Spanish film makers with extra funding.  Since 1999, 
a Spanish law transposing the EU Televisions without 
Frontiers Directive has required that Spanish television 
operators pay 5% of earnings into a special fund to finance 
European film makers.  60% of the funds collected are 
supposed to go to the Spanish industry.  Since 1999, the law 
has been applied in a haphazard way.  Television stations 
have paid voluntarily, but it is estimated that they have not 
paid the half of the sum required by law.  Without 
implementing legislation, the GOS has been unable to enforce 
the law.  According to Isabel Hernandez, Deputy Director 
General for Audiovisual Issues at the Ministry of Industry, 
the previous Partido Popular (PP) administration had been 
meeting with stakeholders and discussing how to implement the 
law for four years.  The PSOE administration decided to work 
off the previous administration\'s foundation and completed 
work on the implementing legislation in three months.  Two 
days after our meeting with Perez, the Council of Ministers 
approved the implementing legislation.  It entered into force 
on July 21.  The GOS will now have an accounting system and 
infrastructure to give them the ability to track and collect 
the funds. 
 
6. (U) In our meeting with Perez, he stressed that the 
Spanish are not interested in getting into a fight with the 
U.S. industry.  He said their intention is to study why the 
Spanish industry has not been successful and to look for 
innovative ways to help the industry.  He underscored that 
they will look at measures that are not discriminatory and 
the process will be transparent.  \"If we are looking at 
measures that would affect the U.S. industry, we would 
contact you and discuss it with the Embassy and the Motion 
Picture Association.\" Perez went on to say that there are a 
number of areas where the GOS  and USG have the same 
interests and said he would like to deepen collaboration with 
the United States on piracy. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  The summertime is a time when the Spanish 
press and government bureaucrats often release trial balloons 
in newspapers in an effort to gauge public reaction to their 
ideas.  This, combined with a minister who has a tendency for 
speaking off the top of her head and without basis, has 
caused the cultural exception idea to flourish, at least in 
the press.  Perez, on the other hand, is not an impulsive man 
and has a reputation for consensus-building.  What is unclear 
is how much power he has and if he will be able to rein in 
the minister if she seizes on a measure that discriminates 
against foreign films.  For the time being, we do not see 
that there is any cause for alarm.  However, we will continue 
to express our interest in this area to our contacts in the 
Ministries of Culture and Industry.

that Spanish firms have been involved in Iran\'s attempt to 
procure military and electronic equipment, according to 
officials in the Office of International Affairs of 
Disarmament.  Such attempts would put Spanish business 
interests at odds with the MFA\'s non-proliferation concerns 
with Iran.  The MFA would welcome an intelligence briefing in

Summary. 
 
2.  (S) We met the Deputy Director-designate for 
International Affairs of Disarmament, Marcos Rodriguez, to 
inform the MFA of Iran\'s attempts to procure military items 
in Spain (reftel).  Rodriguez told us that an Iranian 
delegation of government officials and private business 
leaders visited Foreign Minister Moratinos in May, but they 
did not discuss potential military sells between Iran and 
Spain.  If Izar and other Spanish firms are negotiating with 
Iran to sell military items, it could cause a serious 
conflict between Spanish business interests and the MFA\'s 
support for non-proliferation concerns with Iran, Rodriguez 
said. 
 
3.  (S) Rodriguez explained that officials in the Office of 
International Disarmament Affairs would welcome a U.S. 
intelligence briefing on the attempts of Iran and other state 
sponsors of terror to procure conventional military and 
dual-use goods in Europe.  However, because International 
Disarmament Affair\'s Deputy Director General Laclaustra was 
recently appointed and Spain\'s vacation season is 
approaching, it would be better to schedule an intelligence 
briefing at the end of September, Rodriguez said, when 
officials would be able to focus on the issue.  Rodriguez 
said he would transmit the talking points to the director 
general and report his comments to us. 
 
4.  (C) We will report any significant Spanish reaction.

SUBJECT: TOMAHAWK RELEASABILITY - SPAIN COUNTRY TEAM 
ASSESSMENT 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  Confidential - entire text. 
 
2.  (SBU)  The following is Mission Spain Country Team\'s 
assessment on releasability of the Tomahawk System to the 
Spanish Navy. 
 
3.  (C)  In recent years the Spanish armed forces have 
significantly contributed to international peace, stability 
and the Global War on Terror within a multinational 
framework.  Over the past year, Spain has deployed nearly 
4,000 forces in Iraq, NATO-led forces in Bosnia and Kosovo, 
Operation Enduring Freedom, and ISAF in Afghanistan.  The new 
socialist government pulled Spanish forces from Iraq, but the 
GOS has also recently announced it will increase its presence 
in Afghanistan from some 130 service members to between 940 
and 1,040 by September 2004.  Spanish Navy policy has matured 
to the point that power projection and protection has become 
the mainstay of its required naval capabilities.  The Spanish 
Navy plans to accomplish this primarily via surface 
combatants utilizing advanced weapons systems that offer a 
land-attack capability.  Specifically, the SDR states, \"The 
transformation of the navy involves a re-orientation of its 
fleet away from its oceanic and anti-submarine focus.  It 
must become a force primarily capable of power projection in 
littoral and coastal waters, reaching all the way into the 
interior as well.\"  To achieve this land-strike capability, 
the Spanish Navy has expressed its desire to acquire the 
Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, to be carried on the F-100 
class AEGIS frigate. 
 
4.  (C)  The Spanish Navy has demonstrated a commitment to 
U.S.-derived acquisitions for its complex combat systems. 
The success of the F-100/AEGIS program, and the commitment of 
the Spanish Navy to a U.S. solution in that program has 
strengthened the Spain-U.S. military-military relationship 
and allowed for greater interoperability between U.S. and 
Spanish combat systems and platforms.  This interoperability 
was demonstrated in July 2003 with the success of the 
first-ever combined (U.S. and foreign navy) Combat System 
Ship Qualification Trial, conducted with the Spanish F-101 
and USS Mason.  Additionally, the U.S. and Spanish navies are 
currently coordinating a plan to deploy the F-101 with the 
Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group. 
 
5.  (C)  The release of the Tomahawk to Spain would serve to 
strengthen the U.S.-Spain military-military relationship by 
improving interoperability and would enhance navy-navy 
cooperation already established through the F-100 program. 
Release would also dissuade Spain from looking elsewhere, 
such as to France, to satisfy its desire for advanced weapons 
systems.  Although Spain\'s new socialist government has a 
more Euro-centric focus than the previous government, this 
Foreign Military Sales case, if approved, would outlast the 
current government and probably several others after that. 
The Spanish Navy has the ability to safeguard Tomahawk 
technology.  Training, operation, maintenance and follow-on 
support, in addition to end-use monitoring and compliance 
verifications would all be conducted under FMS guidelines. 
Spain has an established, proven record as a reliable FMS 
customer.  No human rights issues are related to this 
technology. 
 
6.  (C)  Embassy anticipates Morocco may initially react 
negatively to the release of Tomahawk to Spain but would not 
raise serious objections.  Relations between Spain and 
Morocco are warming somewhat, and Morocco would likely accept 
U.S. assurances that the weapon is being released to Spain 
primarily to enhance U.S.-Spain military cooperation.

Classified By: CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES J. ROBERT MANZANARES FOR REASONS 1.4 ( 
B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (C)  Charge Manzanares July 22 delivered to acting 
foreign minister Bernardino Leon Secretary Powell\'s letter to 
FM Moratinos (Reftel).  The Secretary\'s letter responded to 
Moratinos\' letter of June 4 on the case of Spanish journalist 
Couso, who was killed in the Palestine Hotel incident in Iraq 
last year.  Leon thanked Charge for the response, noting that 
the Moratinos letter had been sent in an attempt to respond 
to a request to the Spanish government from the Couso family. 
 Leon expected no further action on this issue from the GOS. 
 
2.  (C)  Charge took the opportunity to convey our concerns 
(using talking points in reftel) about the dormant, but 
possibly still pending, Spanish court case on the Couso 
incident, noting our desire to avoid a situation in which US 
soldiers could be indicted by a foreign court.  In the event 
of any indictments, Charge urged the MFA to issue a strong 
\"friend of the court\" type of brief clearly expressing 
opposition to such a development.  Leon was unaware of the 
pending court case, and undertook to look into the matter. He 
emphasized, however, the completely independent nature of the 
Spanish judiciary and the lack of ability of the government 
to influence decisions on court cases.  Charge noted that if 
such indictments occurred, USG would go back to MFA to again

TREASURY FOR TRACI PHILLIPS 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, SP 
SUBJECT: FINANCE MINISTER SOLBES CLEANS UP BOOKS 
 
REF: MADRID 00162 
 
1.  SUMMARY: Finance Minister Pedro Solbes announced July 16 
his intention to add EUR 6.14 billion (USD 7.4 billion), or 
0.78% of GDP, of non-performing government investments to the 
2004 budget.  This is predicted to give Spain its first 
budget deficit (at 1.2% of GDP), since 1999.  These 
liabilities result from several failed government investments 
such as the liquidation of the Andalusian Government debt, 
investments in Radio-Television Espanola, and loans to 
Argentina. Solbes\' report also called for transparency 
reforms that will increase the amount and clarity of budget 
information to the public.  The opposing Popular Party (PP) 
has criticized Solbes\' move as an attempt to tarnish the 
former PP administration\'s image.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Pedro Solbes, Second Vice-president and Minister of 
Economy, has revised Spain\'s 2004 budget accounting by adding 
EUR 6.14 billion (USD 7.4 billion) in non-performing debts to 
government liabilities. In his July 16 report to the Council 
of Ministers, Mr. Solbes revealed that this change will 
increase Spain\'s projected 2004 deficit from 0.4% to 1.2% of 
GDP, and for the first time in three years Spain will report 
a budget deficit.  (The Social Security payments account will 
add 0.5% of GDP surplus, which originally would have left the 
government with a budget surplus of 0.1%).  Despite this new 
revised 2004 budget, Solbes projected a GOS budget surplus of 
0.1% of GDP in 2005, if the autonomous regional governments 
maintain balanced budgets. 
 
3.  For further background on Solbes\' position, we spoke with 
Jose Luis Kaiser Moreiras, former PP finance advisor and 
currently in the Ministry of Economy, and Alvaro Sanmartin 
Antelo, a current Solbes advisor.  They explained that EU 
rules allow certain government investments, known as 
contingent liabilities, to be kept off the books as long as 
there is credible evidence of return on those investments. 
Solbes has decided that some of these investments now show no 
future feasibility, and has to report them as government 
expenditures in 2004.  Examples of these ventures include the 
liquidation of debt with the Andalusian government, failed 
investments in Radio-Television Espanola, and loans to 
Argentina during its 2001 financial crisis. 
 
4.  Solbes also accounted for budget losses of ailing 
government-owned companies in 2004.  If the results of 
state-owned enterprises do not permit future profitability, 
then Eurostat requires those losses to appear in the 
government budget, as Solbes has done.  Losses by companies 
like RENFE (state-owned railroad), AENA (state-owned aviation 
administration), and the state-owned water company appeared 
in this new deficit figure. 
 
5.  Solbes\' report called for greater transparency in the GOS 
budget.  He called for an amendment to the already existing 
Balanced Budget Law, which would require increased 
transparency and public information.  The transparency 
amendment would require the GOS to make more information 
public, require the National Statistics Institute and the 
Bank of Spain to open their books, and standardize the 
budgetary schedule and information provided to the public. 
 
6.  Mariano Rajoy, Secretary General of the opposition PP, 
dedicated almost an entire press conference on July 21 to 
criticizing Solbes\' move to include these new deficit figures 
in the 2004 budget.  Rajoy claimed that Solbes is trying to 
blame the PP administration for \"hidden deficits,\" in spite 
of the fact that Solbes refuses to use the term to describe 
PP budgeting.  Rajoy added that some of these enterprises 
might still become profitable in the future, or had already 
appeared in previous years\' budgets.  Solbes was head of 
Eurostat, the EU body that validates all EU state budgets and 
finances, before taking the Spanish Finance Minister 
position.  He approved the 2004 GOS budget while in that post 
and Rajoy criticized Solbes for not taking action previously 
if a deficit problem existed. 
 
7.  COMMENT: The PSOE government may not be trying to portray 
the former PP government as having \"hidden\" budget deficits, 
despite sensationalist press reports to the contrary.  The 
timing of these adjustments, post-EU parliamentary elections, 
may indicate that this is not strictly a campaign tactic. 
Solbes may be loading up the 2004 budget with deficit 
liabilities so that the PSOE can claim 2005 and other future 
budget surpluses on its record.  Adjusting the government 
accounts at this time is also a positive move for Solbes\' 
image.  He can portray himself as a fair and respectable 
Finance Minister who displays prudent budgeting practices.

1. (C)  We reviewed the revisions to the Chemical Weapons

Armament Affairs Marcos Rodriguez July 8 at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  Rodriguez told us that officials at Spain\'s 
National Authority for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 
(ANPAQ, an agency under the Ministry of Science and 
Technology) discussed the status of the revised MOU at a July 
8 meeting.  He explained that Spain supports challenge 
inspections as a non-proliferation tool under the 
Organization of Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and 
the issue remains important. 
 
2. (C)  Rodriguez proposed an informal follow-up meeting with 
Poloff and the program director of ANPAQ, Fernando Herencia, 
to discuss the MOU in more detail.  In response to reftel 
suggestion, Rodriguez noted that the MFA and ANPAQ would be 
in a position to discuss the MOU and resolve remaining issues 
with a team from Washington as early as mid-August. 
 
3. (C)  Comment:  The traditional Spanish summer holiday may 
make late September a more realistic time frame for a visit

report them to the Department well in advance of any 
scheduled consultations.  End Comment.

E) RAMC Employee Number: 008042290 
 
F) English Level: 4/3+ 
 
G) Description of duties performed at present: IV FSN 
Supervisor, directs IV and DV processing at post. 
Supervises one FSN and provides guidance and advice to 
First and Second tour FSOs.  She is the principal 
liaison with the DHS office at post for handling 
immigrant visa petitions and waivers.  She also serves 
as post\'s liaison with the Consular Support Help Desk, 
the National Visa Center\'s IV Unit, and KCC. 
 
In liaison with Public Affairs, Elisa coordinates the 
consular public information disseminated by post 
through Embassy Website, telephone scripts for the 
umbrella European visa information contractor (post\'s 
visa information and appointment line), and printed 
information.  She is the senior FSN in the post Fraud 
Prevention Unit.  She creates and maintains FPU files 
containing information from State and DHS. She attends 
all anti-fraud meetings, and builds contacts with local 
police, airport personnel, and Civil Guard. In the 
absence of the FPU FSO, she coordinates all anti fraud 
activities for the consular section.  Elisa serves as 
post\'s resident expert on trafficking in person\'s 
issues. 
 
With significant numbers of Latin American, North 
African, Eastern European, and Sub-Saharan immigrants 
in Spain, the Immigrant Visa unit is a wider range of 
nationalities applying for immigrant visas.  This 
influx of third country national immigrant visa 
applicant requires her to track trends in immigration 
to Spain, terrorist reporting, and organized crime 
patterns. 
 
H) Length of service: 30 Years (1974) 
 
Elisa has worked in different consular units.  She has 
worked the past four (4) years in the IV unit. 
 
I) Prior Participation: 
 
  FSI FSN Fraud Prevention Course Jan29 - Feb2,2001 
 
J) Last visit to DC area: January 2001. 
 
K) Post Justification of nomination: Elisa is truly the 
FSN post turns to first to handle a wide variety of 
consular related issues.  She is engaged, interested 
and anxious for this training opportunity. 
Her English is excellent.  She has specific 
responsibilities for Immigrant Visas and the Fraud 
Prevention Program; however, Elisa has previously 
worked in American Citizen Services and currently works 
closely with the Non-Immigrant Visa unit. This broad 
perspective on consular issues makes her an extremely 
valuable staff member. 
 
Elisa\'s opportunity for training has consisted solely 
of Fraud Prevention training.  Her experience at that 
conference truly transformed Post\'s fraud prevention 
program to one that is not only active but emphasizes 
liaison and cooperation with host country officials. 
Her efforts and contacts in this area resulted in the 
Embassy sending our first International Visitor in the 
area of trafficking in persons.  Her contributions to 
the annual trafficking in person\'s report were 
remarkable - she provided key contacts, information, 
and trends to the political officer drafting the 
report. 
 
Elisa would have a great deal to contribute to the 
conference and would benefit from being exposed to 
ideas from other posts. While she has extensive 
experience at post, with four/4 years in Immigrant Visa 
work, she is still young enough to anticipate many 
years of productive service ahead. The visit to to DHS 
in Vermont would be particularly useful due to the 
close collaboration needed in Madrid between the IV 
section and the DHS Office. She is a strong candidate 
and eager for this training opportunity.

3.  Visitors are reminded that bearers of diplomatic and 
official passports coming to Spain on official business need

4.  THREAT ASSESSMENT: 
 
In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel/state.gov.  In addition to information on the 
Internet, U.S. travelers can hear recorded information by 
calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at 
202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, or receive 
information by automated telefax by dialing 202-647-3000 from

SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCE: VIEWS FROM THE WORKING LEVEL IN 
SPAIN\'S FIU 
 
REF: MADRID 960 
 
Classified By: acting Econ Counselor Richard C. Merrin for reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  SEPBLAC\'s (Spain\'s financial intelligence 
unit) working level officer responsible for terrorist finance 
issues, offered his views on legal and organizational issues 
affecting the fight against terrorist finance in Spain.  He 
predicted that the regulations for Spain\'s 2003 Terrorist 
Finance law would be completed by October.  He criticized the 
weak position SEPBLAC holds on the new Terrorist Finance 
Oversight Committee, but noted that his unit is committed to 
cooperation with other Spanish agencies and financial 
authorities.  Our contact also mentioned that SEPBLAC is 
working on an improved bank communication system, that will 
bring rural banks under oversight.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) We met July 22 with the key working level SEPBLAC 
officer responsibile for terrorist finance issues.  In the 
coming fiscal year, SEPBLAC will hire new officers to create 
a permanent terrorist finance unit, which our contact hopes 
to head.  He just returned from a visit to FINCEN to gain 
understanding about the U.S. financial intelligence unit\'s 
(FIU\'s) role in combating terrorist financing.  He mentioned 
several issues and goals that would enhance his 
organization\'s ability to investigate and combat terrorist 
financing in Spain. 
 
3. (C) Our contact offered a positive outlook on the process 
of transcribing into regulation Spain\'s 2003 Law on the 
Prevention and Blocking of Terrorist Financing.  He noted 
that the statutory Terrorist Finance Oversight Committee (The 
Committee)  met last week to begin the regulation writing 
process.  He hinted that a possible draft already exists and 
the process might be completed as early as October.  Once 
fully enacted, Spain\'s regulators will have significantly 
more preventive and administrative power to fight terrorist 
financing. 
 
4. (C) The SEPBLAC officer expressed concern with the way the 
law is currently written, giving sole authority to launch an 
investigation to the Secretary of State for Security in the 
Ministry of Interior.  In his view, SEPBLAC is the more 
competent agency to police financial transactions because of 
its bank regulating role.  He noted that his superiors are 
considering ways of upgrading SEPBLAC\'s authority on the 
commission during the regulation drafting.  This may not be 
possible without a parliamentary change in the law. 
 
5. (SBU) Increasing international and internal coordination 
is another SEPBLAC priority.  Our contact noted that his 
agency is seeking greater information sharing with the 
Spanish Intelligence Agency, the Spanish National Police, the 
Guardia Civil, and the Ministry of Economy\'s Directorate 
General of the Treasury.  He also mentioned that the current 
director of SEPBLAC is dedicated to improving outreach to 
FIUs in other countries. 
 
6. (C) Our contact brought to light a weakness in SEPBLAC\'s 
ability to communicate asset search and freeze instructions 
to the entire Spanish banking system.  Currently, SEPBLAC\'s 
directives only reach Spain\'s largest banks, covering 80-90% 
of bank activity.  Small rural banks are not currently part 
of SEPBLAC\'s notification and information request system.  To 
remedy this situation, the section our contact heads is 
developing a computer system upgrade to send communications 
to all banks in Spain.  He predicted this system will be 
active in October. 
 
7. (C) Comment.  Our contact confirmed that at the working 
level, SEPBLAC is an organization committed to rooting out 
terrorist financing in Spain.  As an FIU, SEPBLAC is the main 
entity that carrying out Spain\'s efforts to locate and freeze 
terrorist funds.  His comments on the position of the 
Ministry of Interior\'s lead role on the Committee agree with 
our earlier concerns (reftel) on the Ministry of Interior\'s 
hesitance to carry out a preventive fight against terrorist 
financing.  In another recent conversation, an MFA contact 
pointed out that preventive and administrative approaches to 
stopping terrorist financing are counter to the Spanish 
mind-set.  Perhaps if SEPBLAC were given a stronger role, the 
fight against terrorist financing would be more aggressive. 
It will be interesting to see the outcome of the regulations, 
should our contact be correct in his predicted October 
completion date.

SUBJECT: ANDALUSIAN FIRES RAVAGE 35,000 ACRES 
 
REF: LISBON 01196 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  Since July 27, forest fires have raged out of 
control and burned more than 35,000 acres in the Andalusian 
provinces of Huelva and Sevilla.  Authorities have evacuated 
more than 1,160 people from the surrounding areas affected by 
the flames.  The 2004 fire season may be one of the worst in 
recent years, as to date 40% more lands have been destroyed 
by fire this year than in 2003.  These fires continue to 
threaten environmentally sensitive ecological reserves and 
forest lands in the region.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  The largest forest fire in Andalusia in the past five 
years, which started on July 27, has devastated approximately 
35,000 acres in the region.  Authorities have determined that 
the blaze began when garbage container fires went out of 
control and ignited surrounding brush.  The fires have cut 
through various national parks and wildlife reserves in the 
Andalusian provinces of Huelva and Sevilla and have caused 
the evacuation of more than 1,160 people from small towns 
located in the path of the fire.  Evacuated towns include 
Monte Sorromero, Las Delgadas, El Madrono, El Alamo, Minas de 
Riotinto, and Berrocal.  The only known deaths from the fires 
occurred on July 27 when smoke overwhelmed a married couple 
as they drove through the area near the start of the blazes. 
 
3.  Approximately 250 fire fighters joined 15 fire trucks, 12 
planes, 19 helicopters, and police and fire fighters from the 
province of Huelva in fighting the Andalusian blazes.  Other 
smaller fires in the northern regions of Galicia, 
Castilla-Leon, and Asturias, accompanied by the Andalusian 
fires threaten to make this one of the worst fire seasons in 
recent history.  Forest fires this year have already burned 
40% more acreage than last year, comparing year to year 
figures.  The Ministry of the Environment reports that humans 
provoke 80-90% of forest fires in Spain, as is the case in 
the Andalusian fires. 
 
4.  On Wednesday the Minister of the Environment, Cristina 
Narbona, called for zero tolerance against individuals who 
cause forest fires, and made a plea to the people of Spain to 
be more careful when burning fields and with campfires.  She 
was concerned with the loss of vegetation and wildlife in the 
very sensitive Coto Nacional de Pata del Caballo ecological 
reserve.  Flames threatened the reserve on the afternoon of 
July 28, closing in from five different hot points, which 
made combating the flames extremely difficult for fire 
fighters.  The fires in Andalusia continue threatening other 
environmentally sensitive areas such as La Sierra de San 
Pedro (which sustained heavily damaged by forest fires last 
summer) and El Castillo de las Guardas Nature Reserves. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  Thus far, the GOS seems fully capable of 
handling fire fighting efforts.  Unlike the Portugese 
Government, the GOS has made no request for outside 
assistance of which we are aware.

PACKAGE COMPETITION 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY Ambassador Argyros phoned Spanish Defense 
Minister Jose Bono July 16 to reinforce USG concern that the 
bidding process for the Spanish S-80 submarine weapons 
package, in which two U.S. companies are involved, remained 
open and transparent.  Ambassador noted to Bono that the 
bidding deadline had closed during the previous Spanish 
government, but that it now appeared that the process was 
changing to allow French and German firms to compete.  Bono 
claimed the process remained open and transparent and 
expressed his confidence in the U.S. companies involved, but 
noted he had also received calls from the French and German 
Foreign Ministers.  Bono suggested DCM meet with Deputy 
Defense Minister Pardo to further discuss the bidding 
process; Charge met with Pardo July 27 and received a message 
similar to Bono\'s to the Ambassador.  Pardo said no final 
decision would be made until at least the fall of 2004.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
Ambassador\'s call to Defense Minister 
 
2.  (SBU)  Ambassador phoned Defense Minister Bono Friday 
July 16 regarding the S-80 warfare system for the Spanish 
S-80 Submarine project.  Ambassador urged Bono and the GOS to 
strongly consider the American companies as potential vendors 
(both Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are bidding for the 
contract). The Ambassador noted that he understood that the 
Minister was reviewing all contracts that were left without 
being executed by the previous administration.  The 
Ambassador noted that it was understandable the new 
government would wish to understand any contracts it would 
have to sign.  However, the Ambassador stressed he hoped the 
review process would be open and transparent and that there 
would be a level playing field.  The Ambassador raised the 
issue of allowing French or other companies to re-enter the 
bidding process as a concern because as he understood it the 
bidding process had already been closed and allowing new 
entries did not seem to be in the spirit of an open and 
transparent process. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Bono responded that he understood the Ambassador\'s 
concern about the U.S. companies and wanted the Ambassador to 
know that he felt the two that were bidding were good 
companies and that they were highly regarded by the GOS and 
the Spanish Navy.  Bono however added that he had had a 
similar conversation with the French and German Foreign 
Ministers.  Bono told the Ambassador that while the GOS may 
review the previous proposals submitted by the French neither 
the French nor the Germans will have favorable treatment at 
the review. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Bono volunteered that he would instruct his Deputy 
Defense Minister (MOD State Secretary) to call the Embassy 
and provide the details of how the review process will be 
conducted and when it will be decided.   Bono re-emphasized 
he understood why the Ambassador made the call. 
 
Charge\'s discussion with Deputy Defense Minister 
 
5.  (SBU)  As follow-up, Charge met with MOD State Secretary 
Pardo July 26 to review the issue, as Bono had promised. 
Pardo claimed the U.S. should be \"absolutely unworried\" by 
the process.  There is absolutely no anti-American bias in 
the effort, nor is there a tendency to favor European 
companies, Pardo claimed.  The GOS would decide on the basis 
of two criteria:  which system the armed forces considered 
the best technologically and which decision would best 
advance Spain\'s defense industry and its cooperative efforts. 
  In all of this, Pardo repeated, there is \"nothing hidden\" 
nothing \"occult.\"  Charge emphasized the benefits for 
U.S.-Spain relations and for U.S.-Spanish defense ties if the 
Spanish defense firm Izar was able to do business with a U.S. 
firm on S-80 project.  Pardo responded that defense 
cooperation issues would be \"fundamental\" to the 
decision-making process on this contract. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Pardo noted that he himself had decided not to 
meet with any of the companies involved (he had turned down a 
meeting with Lockheed Martin reps last week), in order to 
maintain the integrity of the process.  He said that given 
the highly-charged atmosphere with companies vying for a 
lucrative contract, it was natural that \"rumors\" would arise 
about the process. Charge noted the U.S. concern that the 
technological specifications of the bid had changed in order 
to allow French and German companies to participate.  Pardo 
said there was no formal change in the technological 
specifications, but that the MOD had been or might be in 
touch with some of the companies involved to clarify 
questions or issues. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Pardo stressed the importance to the MOD of 
maintaining strong ties with the U.S., both on a personal and 
political level.  He said Spain wanted to maintain a 
cooperative and friendly relationship with the U.S., and 
noted the two companies involved in the S-80 contract were 
well-regarded. 
 
8.  (SBU)  Pardo told Charge that no decision would be made 
until after Spain\'s traditional August summer break (e.g. at 
the earliest in the fall).

REF: STATE 155954 (C) 
 
1. Embassy Madrid welcomes this Muslim Outreach initiative 
and provides the following information about our outreach 
efforts: 
 
2.  Brief Context for Muslim Outreach efforts in Spain:  An 
estimated 500,000 to one million Muslims live in Spain. 
Almost all are of foreign origin, with only about 3,000 
being Spaniards who have converted to Islam.  Approximately 
60 percent of them are of Moroccan origin, with the next 
largest population from Algeria.  In Catalunya, there is an 
important Pakistani community.  In the Community of Madrid, 
there are 55 mosques.  The Muslim community assumed 
tremendous importance following the terrorist attacks of 
March 11, 2004 on a Spanish commuter train which killed 191 
people.  50 people have been arrested in connection with the 
attacks, the majority of them Muslims of Moroccan origin. 
The Spanish Government has realized that they must reach out 
to their Muslim population, and have proposed a series of 
initiatives including subsidizing mosques, to wean them from 
foreign financing; registering Imams, and requiring them to 
preach their sermons in Spanish; and teaching Islam (under 
the rubric of comparative religion) in the public schools. 
 
3.  Embassy Madrid Programs:  In addition to the programs 
listed below, the Embassy recently created a Muslim Outreach 
Working Group, chaired by the DCM.  At its first meeting, 
the Group commissioned a study by PA\'s Information Resource 
Center on the Islamic Community in Spain.  This 103 page 
report is now completed and has been distributed to the 
Working Group members.  It provides background on the 
Islamic Community in Spain, and lists influential 
institutions and individuals with whom the Embassy should 
initiate or maintain contact.  The following is a status 
report on outreach programs to the Muslim Community:

Classified By: KATHLEEN M. FITZPATRICK, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) & (D) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Spain concurs with the PSI proposal to share 
information with non-member countries, but Spanish defense 
officials continue to question its operational aspects and 
lessons learned.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Over the past few months, we have met with Marcos 
Rodriguez in the Office of International Affairs of 
Disarmament at the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to 
encourage Spain to concur with sharing information and 
operational aspects of the Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) (refs A and B).  Rodriguez, recently designated as 
deputy director of the Office of International Disarmament 
Affairs, finally told us July 30 that Spain concurs with the 
information sharing principles, but Spanish defense officials 
who had also reviewed the proposal raised the following 
concerns about the proposal: 
 
(A) PSI Operational Principles 
 
Rodriguez said that Spanish defense officials were generally 
positive about the PSI\'s operational principles but were 
having some difficulty understanding some of the terms used 
in the proposal.  For example, they did not understand \"C3I\" 
(Note:  Poloff explained the term.  End Note.) or the meaning 
of \"even integration\". (Comment: It may be useful to provide 
the MFA and defense officials with a Spanish translation of 
the proposal that defines or explains technical terminology 
in greater detail.  End comment.) 
 
(B) PSI exercise programs 
 
Rodriguez said Spain has already performed ten successful PSI 
exercise programs and others have been scheduled for 2005, 
one of which will occur in Spain.  He said defense officials 
considered the proposal\'s recommendations on how to perform 
successful PSI exercise programs to be redundant. 
 
(C) Lessons Learned 
 
Rodriguez also noted that Spanish defense officials generally 
accepted the lessons learned from PSI operational exercises, 
but they felt that there was some \"unspoken messages\" in 
them.  For example, Rodriguez explained that defense 
officials were concerned about which country would have the 
lead in pre-planning operational exercises and coordinating 
its command and control procedures.  Defense officials want 
to ensure that Spanish interests are protected in any 
pre-planning exercises or contingencies involving Spain. 
Rodriguez said that defense officials would continue to study 
the details of the PSI proposal and seek clarification at the 
next operational expert\'s meeting.

SUBJECT: SPAIN MEGAPORTS MOA SIGNING AWAITING LEGAL COUNSEL 
REVIEW; CONFUSION BETWEEN CSI AND MEGAPORTS 
 
REF: 03 MADRID 3416 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  We accompanied Department of Energy (DOE) 
Deputy Administrator Paul Longsworth and William Kilmartin of 
the National Nuclear Security Administration\'s (NNSA) Office 
of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation to meetings with the 
director of Spanish Customs and the president of the Ports of 
State regarding the Megaports Initiative (Megaports).  At 
Spanish Customs, the proposed Spanish translation of the 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was discussed and appears to be 
satisfactory, although GOS lawyers need to review the 
language upon their return from August vacations.  The new 
president of the Ports of State was briefed on Megaports with 
its role in combating terrorism and understood a little 
better how Megaports is different from the Container Security 
Initiative (CSI).  End Summary. 
 
GOS MAY BE PREPARED BY LATE SEPTEMBER FOR MOA SIGNING IN THE 
U.S. 
 
2.  (SBU) After some discussion of the proposed changes to 
the Spanish translation of the MOA, Customs Director Nicolas 
Bonilla opined that the modifications were not substantial, 
and anticipated that following a review by legal counsel in 
September, the MOA could be ready for signature.  Bonilla 
noted that the signing should take place no earlier than 15 
days after both parties agree on the final English and 
Spanish versions.  Longsworth responded that the submitted 
English and Spanish drafts are the USG\'s proposed final 
versions, and that the USG hopes for a response from the GOS 
regarding the versions as soon as possible.  Based upon 
Spain\'s August vacation schedule and subsequent legal review, 
Spanish officials were hesitant to consider a signing date 
any earlier than the final week of September, but also did 
not want to speak about specific dates until legal review had 
taken place.  Further, Bonilla suggested several times during 
the discussion that a GOS official could travel to the US to 
sign the MOA. 
 
BRIEFING FOR NEW PRESIDENT OF PORTS OF STATE:  MEGAPORTS AND 
CSI NOT THE SAME 
 
3.  (SBU) Mariano Navas Gutierrez, the newly-appointed 
president of the Ports of State, received an introductory 
briefing on Megaports.  He asked numerous questions about 
Megaports and how it differed from CSI, a Department of 
Homeland Security initiative now underway in Algeciras. 
Although we had briefed him on these two initiatives in June, 
he demonstrated some confusion about the differences and 
similarities of these two initiatives.  He expressed pleasure 
on learning that Megaports should not hinder the flow of 
containers within the ports, and requested that the DOE send 
additional information to him. 
 
4.  (SBU) Comment:  Welcoming a Spanish official to the US 
for the MOA signing could provide an opportunity for further 
briefings on transportation security projects of mutual 
concern.  A visit to a US port where Megaports equipment is 
already installed could also be productive.  While the GOS 
has consistently supported Megaports, some confusion remains 
in distinguishing it from CSI.  It is understood that both 
CSI and Megaports involve many of the same Spanish officials 
and will potentially target the same three ports over the 
next several years:  Algeciras, Barcelona and Valencia. 
Spanish officials realize that both Megaports and CSI combat 
terrorism and involve containers.   Yet these similarities 
probably contribute to the confusion.  From an embassy 
perspective, it seems that CSI and Megaports may be 
distinguished in the following ways, respectively:  document 
inspection followed by scanning of selected containers vs. 
goal of examining all containers; host country paying for 
scanning equipment vs. DOE generally providing the equipment; 
greater DHS personnel involvement in medium-term vs. minimal 
DOE personnel commitment (primarily for set-up and training); 
and sequential anticipated implementation at ports (Algeciras 
implemented before detailed assessment of Barcelona and/or 
Valencia) vs. potential for almost simultaneous activation of 
Megaports in at least two of the three ports.  The Embassy 
continues ready to assist in furthering the implementation of 
both CSI and Megaports.

 1.  (C)  We delivered reftel demarche to Juan Manuel 
Gonzalez de Linares, MFA Deputy Director General of UN 
Affairs, on August 2.  Gonzalez de Linares stated that Spain 
will wait and see what the General Assembly presents to the 
Security Council before taking a definitive position, adding 
that, as always, Spain will try to tone down any aggressive 
language and balance any text that is presented.  He said 
that GOS generally favors the US legalistic argument that the 
ICJ advisory opinion is non-binding and that the GOS would 
have problems with using the Security Council to make the 
advisory opinion binding.  He questioned how the Security 
Council could discuss implementing coercive measures or 
imposing sanctions for an opinion that is legally 
non-binding.  He is aware that the Arab Group of the General 
Assembly has talked of referring the ICJ advisory opinion to 
the Security Council.  He had heard initially that they might 
take action in September 2004.  Later, he heard that the Arab 
Group was going to wait until after the results of the US 
elections. 
 
2.  (C)  Gonzales de Linares offered a personal opinion that 
he said was shared by many in the MFA that Spain would prefer 
to focus on Iraq and Sudan during their one-month Presidency 
of the Security Council in September 2004.  He believes that 
the Israeli-Palestinian security barrier issue could detract 
from other important UN issues.  He noted that the Security 
Council had already voted in 2003 on this very issue.

SUBJECT: USOAS AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING ON LATIN AMERICA 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  In his July 29 meeting in Madrid with 
Spanish MFA Director General Sandomingo, USOAS Ambassador 
Maisto urged Spain to send observers to the Venezuelan 
referendum and to remain firm on Cuba.  Maisto thanked the 
GOS for its decision to send police/troops to Haiti with a 
Moroccan contingent.  End summary. 
 
Haiti 
 
2.  (C)  Sandomingo told Maisto the GOS had not yet 
determined the exact composition of its joint participation 
with Morocco in Haiti.  Morocco\'s likely contribution would 
be more in the form of troops, while Spain\'s would be Spanish 
National Police, Guardia Civil and some force protection 
elements from the military (press reports the Spanish Marines 
might participate), Sandomingo said the total numbers of the 
contingent would be some 200-240, but details were still 
being worked out with the government of Morocco.  Maisto 
expressed USG appreciation for the Haiti contribution, noting 
it had been well regarded in Washington.  He and Sandomingo 
noted the significance of the cooperation with Morocco, just 
several years after the Perejil Island dispute between Spain 
and Morocco.  Sandomingo also emphasized the importance of 
Spain\'s cooperation with an Islamic country.  Maisto also 
noted the importance of Brazil\'s contribution and leadership 
role, and the multilateral nature of the effort, including 
the UN, OAS, U.S., Canada, the Latin Americans and countries 
like Spain and Morocco. 
 
Venezuela 
 
3.  (C)  Maisto expressed disappointment at the failure of 
the EU to mount an observer mission for the Venezuelan 
referendum.  Sandomingo acknowledged this was a huge disaster 
and failure for the EU commission, whose practices are far to 
slow, rigid and bureaucratic.  Maisto asked if Spain would 
consider sending observers on a bilateral basis.  Sandomingo 
indicated Spain did not have the time nor the resources to 
send a bilateral observer mission, but was considering 
sending a group as part of the OAS observer mission.  He said 
Spain\'s participation would be in the form of technical 
experts rather than political officials. Maisto strongly 
encouraged Spain to send a technical team, noting that 
presence of technical experts was equally or in fact more 
important than that of political figures.  Experts who could 
detect fraud in voting machine operations, vote count tallies 
and the like were very much needed, Maisto added. 
 
4.  (C)  Maisto expressed concern about such problems as the 
integrity of the voting process, including voter 
intimidation; efforts to pack the Supreme Court and the 
integrity of the electoral tribunal; voting registry 
anomalies, including the 1.1 million new names on the 
electoral registry; efforts to change the precincts or 
polling locations of some one million people; the process of 
issuance of citizenship cards; and untested touch-screen 
voting technology.  Sandomingo agreed with Maisto on the 
importance of the presence of international observers. 
Sandomingo said that if the international observers could not 
verify the outcome, the referendum results would have no 
value.  He said that even Chaves probably understood this. 
Maisto stressed that U.S. policy on Venezuela was completely 
bipartisan, and this includes the Congress.  Maisto 
underscored that U.S. policy in Latin America in general -- 
including on Cuba and other issues -- is strongly bipartisan. 
 
Cuba 
 
5.  (C)  Maisto asked about Spanish policy in Cuba since the 
release of the 15 political prisoners, including the 
dissident Marta Beatriz.  Maisto said that while the release 
was a good gesture, it was reminiscent of the Soviet style of 
repression, followed by token release of prisoners and demand 
for some sort of reward or recognition.  On the release, 
Sandomingo noted the positive EU statement, which also 
expressed desire for further steps by Havana. 
 
6.  (C)  Sandomingo said that the GOS had some ideas of steps 
in the medium term.  The GOS would like to regain some 
semblance of normal access to Cuban officials, which their 
Ambassador in Havana currently does not have -- the fault of 
Havana, not Madrid, Sandomingo acknowledged.  One idea the 
GOS was pursuing within the EU (which several other EU 
members share) is to terminate EU policy of inviting Cuban 
dissidents to the national days of EU member states.  This 
practice has been anathema to the Cuban government, which 
objects to the symbolism of dissident presence at national 
day celebrations, and to the simultaneous presence of the 
dissidents with Cuban government officials.  Sandomingo added 
that many Cuban officials spurn contact with the dissidents 
because they fear some of the dissidents may be double agents 
for their own security service.  Sandomingo said that as part 
of this proposal, the GOS would propose a broader and more 
meaningful EU program of outreach and dialogue with the 
dissidents, which he said Havana would find easier to accept. 
 Havana might then lift the ban on contacts with Spanish and 
other diplomats, which refuses such access in large part 
because of the national day reception policy.  The EU and its 
members are paying a very high price for the policy that far 
outweighs the benefits the dissidents receive by attending 
the national day receptions.  Currently, Spain and other 
governments are prohibited from having contacts even with 
lower-level Cuban officials who might play a role in any 
future Cuban government. 
 
7.  (C)  Sandomingo also said the GOS was \"considering\" for 
the medium term (no decisions made) re-opening the Spanish 
Cultural Center in Havana.  Sandomingo expressed his view 
that this would not necessarily be seen as an opening to the 
Castro regime, as Havana despised the Spanish cultural center 
because it feared the center, which welcomed all segments of 
Cuban society.  Maisto asked Sandomingo to keep the USG 
informed as these ideas progressed.  He said he had never 
heard the argument that the Cuban government feared the mix 
of dissidents with government officials at the national day 
receptions, nor Sandomingo\'s concept of the Cuban view of the 
cultural center. 
 
Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism (CICTE) 
 
8.  (C)  Maisto thanked Sandomingo for Spain\'s active role in 
CICTE, especially in Costa Rica, and asked for Spanish 
support in the CICTE project on \"Cooperation and Legal 
Assistance Development,\" particularly in the area of 
coordination and structural development.  Sandomingo was 
positive and said Spain likely would offer support.  He noted 
the importance of the terrorism issue for Spain and the 
importance in Latin America of prominent U.S.-Spain 
cooperation. 
 
Dominican Republic 
 
9.  (C)  Maisto noted that USTR Zoellick was signing today an 
FTA with the Dominican Republic as an important step in 
helping to stem deterioration there.  Both agreed the 
situation was of concern, particularly in the economic area.

de Linares, MFA Deputy Director General of UN Affairs,  on 
August 2.  Gonzalez de Linares stated that GOS supports US 
efforts on UNSC 1540 related to the non-proliferation of WMD 
among non-state actors.  He said that the GOS has always been 
a strong supporter in the fight against terrorism and the 
fight against WMD.  GOS believes that all member states 
should comply with UNSC 1540, and GOS does not see any 
problems with the committee\'s Terms of Reference.  GOS will 
support Romania if they bring this issue forward.  Gonzalez 
de Linares believes that Pakistan is alone in their position 
of seeking further delays. 
 
3.  (C)  Additionally, reftel demarche was delivered to 
Enrique de Yturriaga, Special Assistant to the Director 
General of the Coordination Unit for Spain\'s Participation in 
the UNSC, on August 2. Yturriaga also stated that GOS would 
fully support other Security Council members in encouraging 
Pakistan to stop delaying implementation of UNSC 1540.  He 
expected that Pakistan would continue to use stall tactics 
but would eventually yield to international pressure. 
 
4.  (C)  We also solicited Spain\'s general view of UNSC 1540 
in a July 30 meeting with Marcos Rodriguez, Deputy Director 
General-designate for International Disarmament Affairs. 
Rodriguez stated that Spain offered to co-sponsor the 
resolution to give extra legal and political teeth to the 
PSI.  Spanish officials expected Pakistan to slow down the 
implementation of UNSC 1540.  The GOS is now drafting a 
national report on how to implement UNSC 1540 that should be 
completed by the end of October. 
 
5.  (C)  Gonzalez de Linares added that the GOS would like to 
thank USG for the US proposed amendments on the draft 
Presidential Statement concerning the criminal court for the 
former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  GOS appreciates and supports 
the changes, and GOS believes that the US additions make the 
statement stronger.

SUBJECT: SPAIN QUESTIONS EFFECTIVENESS OF REMOVING CAVEATS 
IN KFOR 
 
REF: STATE 162868 
 
Classified By: KATHLEEN M. FITZPATRICK, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) & (D) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) Spain is reviewing restrictions it may have placed on 
Spanish forces that are participating in KFOR but would 
prefer to help strengthen Kosovo police forces to improve 
KFOR\'s effectiveness, according to Kosovo specialists at the 
Spanish Foreign Ministry.  Following the outbreak of violence 
in Kosovo in March, Spain is more likely to remain committed 
to KFOR in support of its overall policy to help maintain 
peace and security in Europe, according to MFA experts.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Removing national caveats 
------------------------- 
 
2. (C) We met with Enrique de Yturriaga, Special Assistant to 
the Director General of the Coordination Unit for Spain\'s 
Participation in the UNSC at the Spanish Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs August 2 to deliver reftel points on how to make KFOR 
more effective and urge Spain to remove national caveats on 
its KFOR forces.  Yturriaga covers Europe, Africa, and 
non-proliferation issues in the UNSC and also has 
responsibilities for Kosovo issues in the MFA.  He told us 
that he would have to review the issue of restrictions placed 
on Spanish forces in KFOR.  Spain sees the proposal to remove 
national caveats as an ongoing dialog within NATO that may 
not affect Spain\'s participation in KFOR.  Yturriaga 
explained that Spanish KFOR forces are engaged in rural areas 
where they carry out activities such as traffic control and 
reconstruction projects.  They are less likely to be involved 
in the type of violence that occurred in March in urban areas 
like Mitrovica, Yturriaga stated.  The Spanish position is 
that removing restrictions on Spanish KFOR or getting KFOR 
more involved in internal security matters in general may not 
be the best solution to improve KFOR\'s security preparedness. 
 
-------------- 
Improving KFOR 
-------------- 
 
3. (C) Poloff asked Yturriaga what types of measures Spain 
would propose to make KFOR more effective.  Yturriaga 
responded that greater cooperation between KFOR, UNMIK and 
OSCE to strengthen the Kosovo police force would be a better 
way to prevent violence and make KFOR more effective over the 
long term.  If KFOR becomes more involved in internal 
security matters, such as controlling domestic conflicts or 
protecting property, it may send a negative message that the 
KFOR was getting too involved in domestic matters or was 
giving special treatment to the Serb minority.  Such a move 
would cast KFOR in a peacekeeping mode when the goal was to 
move toward peace building, Yturriaga said.  Spain would be 
more willing to help improve how the Kosovo police force 
protects civilians rather than to pursue a domestic legal 
process to remove any national caveats that may exist on its 
forces in KFOR. 
 
----------------------- 
Spain\'s KFOR commitment 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) Poloff asked Yturriaga how the new Spanish government 
planned to remain engaged in KFOR.  Yturriaga replied that 
Spain\'s posture was to honor its international commitments 
and involve more civilian authorities rather than military 
forces in its international peace activities.  However, 
following the violence that occurred in Mitrovica in March, 
Spain was unlikely to pursue a policy of replacing troops 
with civilian authorities in KFOR, Yturriaga stated. 
 
5. (C) The Spanish Foreign Ministry had yet to formulate a 
policy position on Kosovo, according to Yturriaga.  Foreign 
Minister Moratinos and State Secretary Bernardino Leon have 
only made general statements expressing Spain\'s commitment to 
increasing security and stability in Europe--including 
Kosovo--and is now more focused on its foreign policy efforts 
in the Middle East, Western Sahara, Afghanistan and Haiti. 
Meanwhile, the Spanish Ministry of Defense is more involved 
in setting the pace of Spain\'s continued troop presence in 
KFOR. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
6.  (C) We will continue to pursue dialogue on this issue 
with the GOS and NATO experts, most of whom have already 
departed on traditional summer leave.  We suggest that the 
Department and/or US NATO also pursue this with their Spanish 
counterparts also.  End comment.

SUBJECT: CUBAN VALIDATION STUDY RESULTS FROM MADRID 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  Embassy Madrid wanted to examine overstay 
rates of applicants issued visas for tourist travel to the 
United States.  Because of the wealth of information 
available on Cuban applicants, the Cuban community\'s travel 
patterns were studied.  Post initiated a validation study to 
determine the reliability of adjudication decisions for Cuban 
tourist visas.  Eighty-seven Cubans who were interviewed 
between December 2002 and May 2003 were contacted to see if 
they had returned from their trip or if they had overstayed 
in the United States.  Fifty-eight of the Cubans contacted 
returned from their trips without incident.  When confirmed 
overstayers are added to likely overstayers, there was an 
overstay rate of 26.4 percent of all applicants in the study. 
 There is no exact profile of a typical overstayer, as ages 
ranged from 6 to 86, and came from all regions in Spain. 
Results were both surprising and discouraging.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  Embassy Madrid was interested in finding out 
overstay rates of different nationalities that were granted 
tourist visas.  Because of the wealth of information 
available on Cuban applicants due to increased security 
procedures, the Cuban community in Spain was selected for 
study.  All Cuban visa applicants interviewed between 
December 1, 2002, and May 31, 2003, were included in the 
study.  Phone interviews with the applicants were conducted 
in February 2004, giving all visa recipients sufficient time 
to visit the United States and return to Spain.  (Cuban 
tourist visas are generally one-entry visas over a six-month 
period.) 
 
3.  (U)  Embassy Madrid\'s study was a validation study of 
visa issuances, but it was not set-up in the traditional 
sense of a non-immigrant visa (NIV) validation study.  For 
this study, Embassy Madrid validated only Cuban visa 
applicants that had received tourist visas.  Applicants that 
were refused tourist visas in the initial interviews were not 
considered in the study.  For this period post adjudicated 
215 Cuban visa cases and had a forty-seven percent refusal 
rate for Cubans. 
 
4.  (U)  All eighty-seven Cubans who interviewed for tourist 
visas between December 2002 and May 2003 were included in the 
study.  Study interviewers used telephone numbers supplied by 
the applicants.  Spanish home numbers were phoned first.  If 
a Spanish home number was unreachable, the interviewer then 
dialed mobile telephone numbers, work telephone numbers, and 
directory assistance.  If an applicant was unreachable after 
several attempts, U.S. information provided on application 
forms was used to contact friends and relatives of the 
applicant who live in the U.S.  Sixty-nine of the Cuban 
applicants were reached.  Eleven of the sixty-nine Cubans 
reached had confirmed overstays.  Fifty-eight of the Cubans 
completed their travel without incident.  Eighteen of the 
applicants were unreachable.  Many of the unreachable 
applicants provided work phone numbers that were either 
non-existent, or numbers where current employers and workers 
had never heard of the applicant.  Others provided 
point-of-contact information in the U.S. or phone numbers 
that did not exist.  Phone numbers can change over time, and 
phones frequently get disconnected, but post believes that at 
a minimum, twelve of these eighteen applicants provided 
inaccurate information and are probable overstays.  When 
these twelve cases are added to the eleven confirmed 
overstays, this makes an estimated overstay rate of 26.4 
percent.  This estimated overstay rate is only for people 
granted tourist visas. 
 
5.  (U)  It is difficult to determine an exact profile of the 
typical Cuban applicant who overstays their visa.  Fifty-five 
percent of overstay applicants were married, while forty-five 
percent were single.  Ages varied from 6 to 86.  Some of the 
applicants who overstayed neglected to mention detailed 
travel plans, but others included very detailed plans. 
Overstayers and likely overstayers came from all regions of 
Spain with slightly more representation in Madrid, Barcelona, 
and the Canary Islands, areas of large Cuban populations. 
 
6.  (U)  Results were both surprising and discouraging, 
considering Embassy Madrid already refused a high number of 
Cubans during the time period used in this study. 
Adjudicating officers have found the study useful, and post 
has already incorporated the study\'s findings into the 
interviewing of Cuban nationals.

SUBJECT: SPANISH HOUSING PRICES CONTINUE TO SOAR 
 
REF: MADRID 604 
 
1. Housing prices continue to rise in the Spanish real estate 
market.  According to Tinsa (Spanish society of home 
appraisers) the price of used housing was 16% higher and new 
dwellings 19% higher midway through the second trimester of 
2004 than the same period of 2003.  These numbers indicate 
that the 2004 housing market is maintaining a similar pace to 
2003, when the average price of housing rose almost 17% 
(reftel). 
 
2. Madrid is Spain\'s most expensive housing market, with an 
average square meter price of EUR 3,063 (USD 3,767 per square 
meter or USD 350.09 per square foot).  The housing market in 
Barcelona is Spain\'s second hottest with a price level of EUR 
2,658 (USD 3,269 per square meter or USD 303.81 per square 
foot). 
 
3. The soaring housing market is one of the key engines of 
Spanish economic growth.  According to a speech given by the 
Minister of Public Works, Magdalena Alvarez, at the 48th 
assembly of SEOPAN (an association of Spain\'s largest 
construction companies), the construction industry provided 
17.7% of Spain\'s 2003 GDP, an increase of 3.9% over 2002, 
compared to an overall GDP growth of 2.4% for 2003.  New 
construction of homes accounted for 22.8% of total 
construction, while renovation and maintenance of existing 
buildings (including housing) contributed 17.3%.

Classified By: Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick, Political Counselor. 
Reasons 1.4 (B) & (D) 
 
1.  (C) Following up on USOAS Ambassador Maisto\'s strong 
pitch to the GOS on the Venezuelan presidential referendum 
(ref a), Poloff delivered ref b points on August 10 to Javier 
Ignacio Martinez del Barrio, Technical Advisor to the Deputy 
Director for Countries within the Andean Community.  Martinez 
told Poloff that Spain has made numerous statements in 
support a free and fair recall referendum in Venezuela. 
Martinez said that the European Union was unable to reach an 
agreement with the Government of Venezuela (GoV) because the 
EU felt the GoV did not meet EU requirements on when to 
pre-position monitors before the referendum and whether to 
give them unrestricted access to conduct monitoring 
activities.  However, the EU decided last week to send five 
technical experts to assist the Venezuelan referendum under 
the umbrella of the OAS, Martinez explained.  The EU would 
announce its participation in Venezuela referendum this week. 
 Martinez added that Spain fully supports for the OAS\'s and 
Carter Center\'s initiatives in Venezuela. 
 
2.  (C) Working with Embassy Madrid\'s PAS, Ambassador Maisto 
conducted an active outreach program with the Spanish media 
during his late July visit.  Maisto urged strong public 
support for a free and fair referendum in Venezuela.  Media 
activities included: 
 
(A)  El Pais interview with Ambassador Maisto on August 5. 
 
(B)  Spanish National Radio (RNE) 5 network interview with 
Ambassador Maisto on August 5, rebroadcast on RNE Foreign 
Radio, heard principally in Latin America. 
 
(C)  Antena 3 TV interview with Ambassador Maisto, recorded 
July 29 and expected to be rebroadcast on Antena 3 just 
before the Venezuela referendum and during the Spanish 
Program \"Seven Days\" news analysis show in mid-August. 
 
3.  (C) The Spanish business daily \"Business Gazette\" 
published August 11 a strongly worded editorial supporting 
the efforts of the opposition to save Venezuela from \"the 
despotism colonel Chavez runs.\"  However, we do not expect 
the Spanish media to report Venezuelan reaction until just 
before and just after the referendum.  PAS will look for 
appropriate material from the Washington file, which we can 
use to develop an op-ed under the byline of the Charge or 
another senior USG official.

4. THREAT ASSESSMENT: 
 
In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid and other large 
cities in Spain -- including resort/convention areas such as 
Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals and 
pick-pockets and frequent incidents of crimes of opportunity 
against the unwary do occur.  Carry only essential items, 
including a photocopy of your passport\'s photo page. 
Visitors can protect themselves from crime by being 
street-smart, alert, and aware of their surroundings.  In the 
event you are victimized by crime, or experience any other 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550, or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov), and the U.S. 
Embassy\'s website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel/state.gov.  In addition to information on the 
Internet, U.S. travelers can hear recorded information by 
calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at 
202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, or receive 
information by automated telefax by dialing 202-647-3000 from

and on August 10, the MFA issued a strong communique 
condemning kidnappings and killings in Iraq.  An unofficial 
translation of the MFA statement follows. 
 
2.  Text of August 10 MFA Communique: 
 
The Government wishes to express its deep concern for the 
wave of kidnappings and killings that have devastated Iraq in 
the last few months.  Such criminal acts affect third-country 
nationals whose only wish is to participate in the 
reconstruction of Iraq and the return to normality in 
civilian life, are direct attacks against the security and 
stability of the whole of Iraqi society, and delay the full 
incorporation of Iraq into the international community. 
 
All this leads the Government to express its most robust 
condemnation against the recent kidnappings and 
assassinations, as well as the blackmail of governments and 
contract businesses, whose citizens and workers have been the 
victims of such acts.  In addition, the Government reiterates 
its firm willingness to contribute, within the framework of 
the international community, to the stability, 
democratization, reconstruction, and territorial integrity of 
Iraq.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EIND, ELAB, EWWT, SP 
SUBJECT: EU SANCTION FORCES SPAIN\'S SHIPBUILDER INTO 
RESTRUCTURING OR BANKRUPTCY 
 
1. SUMMARY. The Spanish press reported late July that the 
European Commission has ruled that Spain,s Izar Naval 
Constructions, a quasi-public company, violated the terms of 
EU aid for the shipbuilding industry and must return EUR 1.1 
billion (USD 1.35 billion).  This payment return threatens 
the solvency of Izar and has prompted the GOS to initiate a 
company restructuring, separating the civil and military 
sectors.  Spanish unions fear this plan will result in a huge 
amount of job losses and are considering action to prevent 
the dissolution. END SUMMARY. 
 
EC POSITION 
----------- 
 
2. The Commission is demanding the payment of EUR 1.1 billion 
(USD 1.35 billion) from Izar for the improper use of EU 
public aid funding in shipyard restructuring.  In 1997, the 
Commission and the European Council approved restructuring 
aid for the then publicly owned Spanish shipyards amounting 
to EUR 1.38 billion (USD 1.69 billion) on the condition that 
no further aid would be provided.  Between 1999 and 2000, the 
State Society of Participating Industries (SEPI), the Spanish 
majority shareholder of Izar, granted EUR 500 million (USD 
614 billion) in further aid to the civil public shipyards 
that are today owned by Izar.  SEPI granted aid in the form 
of a capital injection worth EUR 252.4 million (USD 309.6 
million), a loan worth EUR 192.1 million (USD 235.7 million), 
and paid a purchase price allegedly above market value.  This 
further aid is perceived as giving Izar an uncompetitive 
advantage in the shipbuilding industry, and shipyards in 
other EU Member States and other Spanish competitors have 
filed complaints. 
 
GOS PLAN 
-------- 
 
3. Izar is Spain,s leading civil and military shipbuilding 
company, created in December 2000 following the merger of 
Astilleros Espanoles S.A. and Empresa Nacional Bazan.  To 
prevent Izar from entering bankruptcy after paying the EC, 
the GOS has proposed the creation of a society of naval 
shipbuilders, where military activity will be separated from 
civil activity.  If restructuring does not take place, the 
GOS has predicted that Izar will become bankrupt four months 
after repayment.  This separation would result in the closing 
of most of Izar,s facilities, as the GOS has deemed that 
only two out of the eight facilities ) Ferrol and Cartagena 
) meet a &standard of acceptable activity.8  In addition, 
the GOS expects to draw capital from the private sector 
through the sale of Izar,s motor production arm from Manises 
and its shipyards in Sevilla. 
 
UNION CONCERN 
------------- 
 
4. The Spanish press also reported that the General Trade 
Union of Workers and the Workers, Commission have announced 
that they will attend the next SEPI meeting scheduled for 
September 7 to seek clarification on the specifics of the 
government plan.  Further, they anticipate presenting some 
&alternatives8 and &opinions8 to the presumed measures. 
If SEPI confirms the separation of civil and military 
shipyards, the unions have promised to schedule a series of 
demonstrations.  Workers fear huge job losses if the civil 
and military sectors are separated. 
 
5. COMMENT. Considering that the GOS is a majority 
shareholder of Izar through SEPI, it has the power to make 
the changes it deems necessary.  Izar has a coveted position 
in the shipbuilding industry in Europe and the GOS wants to 
protect that role even at the expense of some job losses. 
Whether the unions have the ability to prevent the government 
plan remains to be tested.  If the unions rally in September, 
this will be a major test of the new Socialist government\'s 
strength over the labor unions. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: SPAIN REDUCES CIVIL SERVANT WAGE INCREASE 
 
 
1. SUMMARY. The Spanish press reported in late July that the 
new Socialist government is proposing a 3.2% increase in 
civil servant wages, rather than the 3.5% union goal, in the 
2005 National Budget.  This excludes the 0.3% allocated for 
the recovery of purchasing power lost in the last eight 
years. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. The new Socialist government is proposing a 3.2% increase 
in civil servant wages in the 2005 National Budget.  In late 
July, the GOS initial plan of 3.5%, proposed by the Ministry 
of Public Administration, was revised downwards by the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance.  The 3.5% proposal consisted 
of 2% for predicted inflation, 0.5% for payroll increases to 
support the civil servant pension fund, 0.7% for productivity 
payments, and 0.3% for the recuperation of purchasing power 
lost in the last eight years.  The 3.2% proposal omits the 
purchasing power share. 
 
3. The civil servant wage increase would apply to 2.35 
million public employees, with priority given to the police 
and Civil Guard to improve their labor conditions. 
 
4. The Spanish press also reports that labor unions have 
rejected the 3.2% measure citing the importance of 
recuperating purchasing power.  The unions quickly reminded 
the government that this plan was one of the electoral 
promises made by the Socialist Party, and they have called 
upon the government to initiate a process of negotiation to 
take place in September. 
 
5. COMMENT.  When the Minister of Economy and Finance, Pedro 
Solbes, was appointed, the Spanish business community was 
relieved, anticipating that he would be a forceful advocate 
of fiscal discipline.  With this reduction in wage increases, 
his ministry has trumped the government\'s aspirations to 
quickly meet the demands of civil servants, indicating that 
Minister Solbes will continue to play budgetary watchdog on 
the government.  Nevertheless, if the Socialist government 
stands by its proposal of 3.2%, it will not distinguish 
itself from the previous administration, which recently fixed 
wage increases between 3.2% and 3.3%. END COMMENT.

DEMARCHE

Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Robert J. Riley, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Following up on ref A demarche and ref B reporting 
cable concerning U.S. Global Defense Posture Review (GDPR), 
we delivered the demarche August 15 to General Felix Sanz, 
the Spanish Armed Forces\' Chief of Defense, and Admiral 
Francisco Torrente, Secretary General for Defense Policy at 
the Ministry of Defense (undersecretary for policy 
equivalent).  Both defense officials received the demarche 
very well.  Sanz said he appreciated the update and the 
advance notice of President Bush\'s speech.  Spain 
understands, said Sanz, that the U.S. has the freedom and the 
right to revamp the placement of its forces as it sees fit. 
The only thing Spain requests is advance notice of any impact 
the changes will have on Spain. 
 
2.  (C) Torrente also welcomed the demarche, saying Spain has 
been and will remain a loyal ally of the United States. 
Spain appreciates the open dialogue it has had with the U.S. 
on GDPR.  The U.S., Torrente said, could count on very good 
cooperation from Spain on GDPR, just as Spain has cooperated 
closely with the U.S. on defense matters for the last 50 
years. 
 
3.  (C) Comment:  Both defense officials appreciated the 
advance notice of the President\'s speech and the GDPR update. 
 To the extent the evolving GDPR impacts Spain and 
particularly the U.S. presence at Rota Naval Air Station and 
Moron Air Base, the earlier we can communicate the relevant 
details to the Spanish, the better.

TAGS: EFIN, ECON, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN: IMMIGRANT REMITTANCES ACHIEVE RECORD LEVELS 
 
1.  Summary. The large increase in cash remittances by 
immigrants from Spain to their home countries has caught the 
attention of the general Spanish media and the business press 
this summer.  According to the Bank of Spain immigrants and 
other foreigners residing in Spain have remitted 
approximately EUR 250 million (USD 322 million) a month 
during 2004, an increase of 20% over last year.  The majority 
of remittances leave Spain for Latin American countries.  The 
government of Morocco reported a 64% annual increase in 
remittances in 2003 to EUR 300 million (USD 366 million) Some 
observers suggest a tie to drug smuggling and money 
laundering, but no solid ties have been made.  End Summary. 
 
2. The large increase in cash remittances by immigrants from 
Spain to their home countries has caught the attention of the 
general Spanish media and the business press this summer. 
According to the Bank of Spain (BoS) immigrants and other 
foreigners residing in Spain have remitted approximately EUR 
250 million (USD 322 million) a month during 2004, an 
increase of 20% over last year.  BoS figures also indicate 
that the majority of this money (57%) is sent to Latin 
America.  Another 3.5% is sent to European countries.  The 
numbers also show that 91% of all remittances from Spain go 
through the U.S.  The BoS does not have exacting figures for 
money headed to other regions.  The recent press highlighted 
reports by the government of Morocco that Moroccans resident 
in Spain sent EUR 300 million (USD 366 million) home in 2003, 
an increase of 64% over the previous year. 
 
3. Sending remittances of income earned in Spain to their 
countries of origin is the most important banking activity 
for the vast majority of immigrants in Spain.  However, the 
flow can be hard to track due to the use of the non-bank wire 
services and the unofficial immigrant service centers known 
as locutorios.  Much of the money flows in small amounts.  A 
contact at Banco Santander (Spain\'s largest bank) emphasized 
that due to the difficulty of tracking these data, the BoS\'s 
statistics could not be entirely accurate.  Our contact 
de-emphasized the press focus on the large rise in 
remittances, noting that new regulations in recent years and 
the efforts of Spanish authorities to increase supervision to 
prevent money laundering has led previously untraceable funds 
to show up in statistics.  In addition, the rise in immigrant 
numbers and their improved economic position contributes to 
greater flows home. 
 
3. Spanish and international business journals have 
highlighted the fight between Spanish banks and savings 
exchanges to attract immigrant business.  Most remittance 
business is captured by money wire services such as Western 
Union or MoneyGram and through  locutorios.  The press 
reports that the savings exchanges (cajas de ahorro) have 
been more successful at drawing immigrant businesses than 
traditional banks.  However, the larger Spanish banks are 
interested in the immigrant market, particularly to attract 
business in more profitable banking services.  Both our Banco 
Santander contact and a contact at Spain\'s second largest 
bank, Banco Bilbao Viscaya Argentaria (BBVA), indicated that 
their banks are developing plans to attract more immigrant 
business, but not focusing on remittances.  Our BBVA contact 
noted that 700 thousand immigrants entered Spain in 2003 and 
the immigrant flow from 2000-2004 comprises 4-5% of Spain\'s 
current population.  These new immigrants are staying and 
offer a strong market for new customers. 
 
5. An August 9 article in the Spanish paper El Pais, focused 
on the large increase in remittances from Moroccan 
immigrants, citing the 63.7% increase in 2003 over 2002 
figures from the government of Morocco.  The article did not 
explain the large bump in remittances which paralleled a 
worldwide increase in Moroccan remittances making Morocco the 
fourth most important recipient of emigre remittances after 
India, Mexico and the Philippines.  The article mentioned the 
possibility that the increase was a result of money 
laundering from drug remittances, but noted that the small 
amount of remittances does not follow the pattern of large 
indirect money flows through the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta 
and Melilla. 
 
6. Comment.  As members of the growing immigrant population 
continue to find jobs in Spain, remittances will continue to 
flow to immigrants\' home countries.  The inability of the BoS 
to accurately track these funds is problematic considering 
international and Spanish efforts to track monetary flows.

SUBJECT: MORATINOS AGREES WITH US POSITION FOR WEOG 
ROTATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION 
 
REF: A. REF A: STATE 172297 
     B. REF B: MADRID 03080 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen Fitzpatrick for reasons 1.4 
 (b) and (d). 
 
 1.  (C)  Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos 
agrees with US efforts to reach a rotation agreement within 
WEOG to occupy the posts assigned in the Human Rights 
Commission.  Poloff received the text of Moratinos\' response 
to Secretary of State Colin Powell\'s August 11 letter (Ref A) 
from Gonzalo Alvarez Garrido, Acting MFA Deputy Director 
General for UN Affairs, on August 26. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Begin Text of Letter. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Dear Rt. Hon. Colin Powell, Secretary of State, 
United States of America. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Thank you for your letter of August 11; I have 
made note of your request to continue working on the rotation 
agreement in the WEOG in relation to the Human Rights 
Commission, which we will consider with the greatest 
interest.  I hope that this is another of the many United 
Nations fields in which Spain can work efficiently with the 
United States. 
 
5.  (SBU)  I agree with you on the need to reach a rotation 
agreement within the WEOG, to occupy the posts assigned in 
the Human Rights Commission.  As you point out in your 
letter, this agreement would allow WEOG members to 
concentrate better on the defense and promotion of Human 
Rights and Democracy in the HRC.  Like you, I think the work 
done by Canada and Holland provides a point of departure for 
negotiation which we also wish to foment, to reach an 
understanding which is satisfactory to all.  In this sense, I 
am grateful for the United States\' willingness to cede 
another year in the arrangement under the plan proposed by 
Canada and Holland. 
 
6.  (SBU)  In previous negotiations, Spain already expressed 
its concern about the number of years assigned particularly 
when, in the past, this country was clearly underrepresented 
in the HRC.  To reach a satisfactory agreement, all of us, 
large and less large, will have to act flexibly, making 
sacrifices in order to come to compromise solutions. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Spain, certainly along with the other members of 
the European Union, is absolutely willing to work and 
coordinate on this matter with the United States in New York, 
and with all WEOG partners, on the basis of the reflections 
so far produced by Canada and the Netherlands. 
 
8.  (SBU)  I have given instructions to our Mission in New 
York to continue in contact with your representative--which I 
understand has already happened in this matter--and with 
other WEOG members, to reach an agreement as soon as possible. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Sincerely, Miguel Angel Moratinos. 
 
10.  (SBU)  End Text of Letter. 
 
11.  (C)  Comment:  Spain has favored WEOG rotation reform 
for the HRC in the past, although they had problems with the 
years allocated to Spain in the membership matrix proposed by 
Canada and the Netherlands.  For example, the proposed matrix 
allocated Spain 11 years of membership in a 20-year cycle, 
while Canada, a country with 10 million fewer people than 
Spain, was allocated 14 years of membership during the 
20-year cycle.  The GOS\'s willingness to show flexibility and 
make sacrifices to achieve a compromise in a timely fashion 
is an encouraging development.

SUBJECT: SPANISH CABINET APPROVES C02 EMISSIONS PLAN TO 
MEET KYOTO TARGETS 
 
REF: MADRID 1743 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  The GOS August 27 issued a Royal 
Decree-Law that launched a National CO2 Emissions Allocation 
Plan designed to both:  (1) set Spain on course for meeting 
its CO2 emissions commitments under the Kyoto Protocol; and, 
(2) comply with the EU Directive intended to launch the EU\'s 
CO2 trading regime come January 1, 2005.  This law suggests 
that Zapatero\'s Government takes Spain\'s Kyoto commitments 
more seriously than it predecessor and sets the stage for 
Spain to feel, for the first time, the economic costs of the 
Kyoto approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  During its first official session after the summer 
holiday, the Spanish Cabinet (\"Consejo de Ministros\") on 
August 27 approved a 2005-2007 National CO2 Emissions 
Allocation Plan designed to meet Spain\'s commitments under 
the terms of the Kyoto Protocol.  The plan authorizes an 
annual average of 172.31 million emission \"rights\" (each 
right equaling one ton of CO2 emissions) divided among 
covered industry sectors.  It specifies the methodology 
through which these rights are divided among sectors and how 
compliance is measured.  Affected sectors are given until 
September 30 of this year to apply for individual CO2 
emission rights authorized for their sector.  On October 1, 
these rights will be codified into a National Emission Rights 
Register (\"Registro Nacional de Derechos de Emision\") which 
will be controlled by the Environment Ministry and open to 
public scrutiny.  This codification will form the legal basis 
for later trading in emission rights. 
 
3.  (U)  According to the plan, the covered sectors encompass 
40 percent of traditional Spanish CO2 emissions (including, 
inter alia, electricity generation, the mining and refining 
of ferrous metals, and the cement, glass, ceramics, and paper 
products sectors).  The non-covered sectors, representing 60 
percent of traditional Spanish C02 emissions, are expected to 
emit 225.79 million tons of CO2 per year during this period 
for a total average annual emission of 398.1 million tons. 
This would represent a 0.2 percent drop compared to total 
2002 CO2 emissions of 401.34 million tons.  The stated goal 
of the 2005-7 plan, which is formally titled Regulating the 
Commercial Regime of Greenhouse Gas Emission Rights\" 
(\"Regulado el Regimen del Comercio de Derechos de Emision de 
Gases de Efecto Invernadero\") is to stabilize current 
emissions at the rate measured from 2000-2. 
 
4.  (U)  For serious violations of emission authorizations, 
the plan includes provisions for closing facilities as well 
as for fines of up to two million Euros.  Less serious 
infractions will be punished by fines of 40 Euros for each 
CO2 ton over the limit during the period of 2005-7, climbing 
to 100 Euros per excess ton in the 2008-12 period. 
 
5.  (U)  Through this plan, Spain hopes that total CO2 
emissions in the 2008-12 period do not exceed 1990 emission 
levels (the Kyoto base line) by more than 24 percent. 
Spain\'s Kyoto target is 15 percent over the 1990 CO2 
emissions baseline.  Under the plan, Madrid hopes to find the 
missing nine percent through a mixture of carbon sink credits 
(two percent) and emission credits obtained on the 
international market (seven percent). 
 
6.  (U)  Finally, the decree creates an inter-ministerial 
commission to supervise all GOS efforts to meet its Kyoto 
commitments.  Members will include representatives from the 
Foreign, Economy/Finance, Environment, and 
Industry/Tourism/Commerce ministries, as well as a 
representative from the President\'s Office of Economic 
Affairs.  The formal head of this Commission will be Arturo 
Gonzalo Aizpiri, Secretary General of the Environment 
Ministry\'s Office of Pollution Prevention and Climate Change. 
 
 
7.  (U)  Approval of this plan, which had originally been 
drawn up by the Aznar Government but was not approved by the 
cabinet prior to that government\'s defeat in the March 
national elections, will allow Spain to submit to Brussels 
its national CO2 emissions plan required under an EU 
directive 87/2003.  This, in turn, should allow Spain to 
participate in the new EU CO2 emissions market that is 
expected to debut on January 1, 2005.  This submission has 
been overdue in Brussels since March 31. 
 
8.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  With this announcement, Spain takes a 
step toward, at least on paper, meeting its Kyoto targets. 
It also addresses the need to formally implement the EU 
emissions trading directive via national regulation.  One 
should not be surprised that Zapatero\'s center-left coalition 
would be more attracted to Kyoto than its center-right 
predecessor.  And it is of course easier to impose such 
regulations immediately after an election.  However, once the 
economic costs of attempting to meet these targets become 
more readily apparent, it will be interesting to see exactly 
how green is Zapatero\'s valley.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/20/2014 
TAGS: PREL, SP, UNSC, UN 
SUBJECT: A MID-TERM LOOK AT SPAIN\'S SECURITY COUNCIL 
PRESIDENCY 
 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Robert J. Riley for reasons 1 
.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Poloff discussed Spain\'s Security Council 
September presidency with Juan Manuel Gonzalez de Linares, 
MFA Deputy Director of United Nations Affairs, and Enrique de 
Yturriaga Saldanha, MFA head of UNSC Issues.  Both stressed 
that Spain has tried to be an \"honest broker\" as the head of 
the UNSC, where Spain\'s advocacy of issues has been toned 
down.  Spain\'s priorities during their presidency include: a 
discussion among UNSC foreign ministers on the \"civilian 
aspects of conflict management and peace building;\" the 
crises in Sudan and Congo; the ongoing stability and 
reconstruction efforts in Iraq; peacekeeping efforts in Haiti 
and Afghanistan; counter-terrorism; UNSC mandates and reports 
in Ethiopia and Eritrea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cyprus; and 
continued instability in the Middle East.  Spain is 
interested in structural reform of the UN to include UNSC 
enlargement, but not an expansion of permanent members, and 
there is currently a debate within the MFA over how to 
proceed with the reform.  END SUMMARY 
 
CONFLICT MANAGEMENT SESSION 
 
2.  (U)  Spain would like to take advantage of the presence 
of many foreign ministers in New York on September 22 to 
discuss what the GOS is terming the \"civilian aspects of 
conflict management and peace building.\"  Spain has 
distributed a discussion document to members of the UNSC and 
looks forward to making this discussion the highlight of its 
presidency. 
 
CRISES IN SUDAN AND CONGO 
 
3.  (C)  The crises in Sudan and Congo continue to be high 
priorities.  Spain has been involved in trying to achieve 
acceptable language for an additional UNSC resolution on the 
Darfur crisis in Sudan.  Spain favored many elements of a US 
draft resolution on Darfur, but placed greater emphasis on 
the role of the African Union and the construction of 
international commissions to review human rights abuses. 
Spain favors MONUC troop expansion in the Congo.  Spain has 
been working with other UNSC members on proposals to expand 
MONUC into new regions and add a rapid force that would help 
maintain the arms embargo and assist in the Congolese 
electoral process. 
 
IRAQ 
 
4.  (U)  On Iraq, Spain was eager to see the results of 
reports on the Multinational Force from the U.S. and the 
Secretary General\'s office.  The GOS views these reports as 
 
SIPDIS 
important because they are the first reports since 
sovereignty was transferred to the Iraqis from the Coalition 
Provisional Authority.  UNSG Special Representative for Iraq 
Ashraf Qazi briefed the UNSC on the situation in Iraq 
September 14.  His briefing noted that the \"vicious cycle of 
violence\" is undermining UN efforts to rebuild Iraq. 
 
HAITI AND AFGHANISTAN 
 
5.  (U)  UN missions in Haiti and Afghanistan continue to be 
important to Spain because of the deployment of Spanish 
troops in peacekeeping operations in those countries.  The 
Spanish Council of Ministers authorized the sending of 200 
Spanish troops to Haiti as part of a joint Moroccan-Spanish 
battalion on September 10, and the Ministry of Defense has 
said Spanish troops will be operational in Afghanistan by 
September 27.  There will be a report by the UNSG on the 
current situation in Haiti on September 26. 
 
COUNTER-TERRORISM 
 
6.  (C)  Gonzalez de Linares stressed that Spain would like 
to make UNSC efforts more efficient and dynamic.  Former 
Spanish ambassador to the U.S. Javier Ruperez is now the 
Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive 
Directorate at the Assistant Secretary-General level, and 
Spain would like to build on his experience with the issue. 
Yturriaga stressed that the issue of counter-terrorism was 
very important to Spain, but that Spain would likely work 
through committees to promote the issue and that there 
probably would not be UNSC action during their Presidency. 
 
ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA 
 
7.  (U)  The UNSC unanimously adopted UNSCR 1560 to extend 
the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) on September 
14.  Spain along with other UNSC members is concerned about 
the lack of progress in the border demarcation between 
Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
 
OTHER MANDATES 
 
8.  (U)  The UNSC will review mandates in Liberia and Sierra 
Leone before the end of the month.  The UNSG will also 
introduce a report by the end of the month on the next steps 
in Cyprus, and there should also be an update on the UN\'s 
peacekeeping mission in Bougainville. 
 
THE MIDDLE EAST 
 
9.  (C)  Spain will continue to welcome proposals that 
enhance security and stability in the region.  Spain is 
following developments very closely in the recent UNSC 
resolution pressuring Syria to respect Lebanese sovereignty. 
Both Linares de Gonzalez and Yturriaga agreed that 
unanticipated issues concerning the Middle East were likely 
to come before the UNSC during Spain\'s presidency. 
 
SECURITY COUNCIL STRUCTURAL REFORM 
 
10.  (C)  Both Gonzalez de Linares and Yturriaga said that 
Spain supports any UNSC reform that would serve the interests 
of all member states and improve the efficiency of the UNSC. 
Spain does not favor more permanent members of the UNSC, but 
additional nonpermanent members could provide a more 
representative UNSC.  Spain would like to see more 
cooperation between the UNSC, UNGA, and ECOSOC. 
 
11.  (C)  Yturriaga told Poloff that there are differing 
views in the MFA on the issue.  Some members of the MFA want 
permanent UNSC members to only have veto power over issues in 
Chapter 7 of the UN charter; they would like to require at 
least two vetoes by permanent members for all other issues. 
 
12.  (C)  There will be a panel report on UN structural 
reform before December that will include UNSC structural 
reform ideas.  The report likely will fuel discussion on 
possible changes in the UNSC.  Spain does not have an 
official positions on many of the likely reform ideas, but 
there is clearly a lively debate within the MFA over what a 
more representative UNSC would look like.

SIPDIS 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/20/2014 
TAGS: PREL, SP, UNSC 
SUBJECT: A MID-TERM LOOK AT SPAIN\'S SECURITY COUNCIL 
PRESIDENCY 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Robert J. Riley for reasons 1 
.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Poloff discussed Spain\'s Security Council 
September presidency with Juan Manuel Gonzalez de Linares, 
MFA Deputy Director of United Nations Affairs, and Enrique de 
Yturriaga Saldanha, MFA head of UNSC Issues.  Both stressed 
that Spain has tried to be an \"honest broker\" as the head of 
the UNSC, where Spain\'s advocacy of issues has been toned 
down.  Spain\'s priorities during their presidency include: a 
discussion among UNSC foreign ministers on the \"civilian 
aspects of conflict management and peace building;\" the 
crises in Sudan and Congo; the ongoing stability and 
reconstruction efforts in Iraq; peacekeeping efforts in Haiti 
and Afghanistan; counter-terrorism; UNSC mandates and reports 
in Ethiopia and Eritrea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cyprus; and 
continued instability in the Middle East.  Spain is 
interested in structural reform of the UN to include UNSC 
enlargement, but not an expansion of permanent members, and 
there is currently a debate within the MFA over how to 
proceed with the reform.  END SUMMARY 
 
CONFLICT MANAGEMENT SESSION 
 
2.  (U)  Spain would like to take advantage of the presence 
of many foreign ministers in New York on September 22 to 
discuss what the GOS is terming the \"civilian aspects of 
conflict management and peace building.\"  Spain has 
distributed a discussion document to members of the UNSC and 
looks forward to making this discussion the highlight of its 
presidency. 
 
CRISES IN SUDAN AND CONGO 
 
3.  (C)  The crises in Sudan and Congo continue to be high 
priorities.  Spain has been involved in trying to achieve 
acceptable language for an additional UNSC resolution on the 
Darfur crisis in Sudan.  Spain favored many elements of a US 
draft resolution on Darfur, but placed greater emphasis on 
the role of the African Union and the construction of 
international commissions to review human rights abuses. 
Spain favors MONUC troop expansion in the Congo.  Spain has 
been working with other UNSC members on proposals to expand 
MONUC into new regions and add a rapid force that would help 
maintain the arms embargo and assist in the Congolese 
electoral process. 
 
IRAQ 
 
4.  (U)  On Iraq, Spain was eager to see the results of 
reports on the Multinational Force from the U.S. and the 
Secretary General\'s office.  The GOS views these reports as 
 
SIPDIS 
important because they are the first reports since 
sovereignty was transferred to the Iraqis from the Coalition 
Provisional Authority.  UNSG Special Representative for Iraq 
Ashraf Qazi briefed the UNSC on the situation in Iraq 
September 14.  His briefing noted that the \"vicious cycle of 
violence\" is undermining UN efforts to rebuild Iraq. 
 
HAITI AND AFGHANISTAN 
 
5.  (U)  UN missions in Haiti and Afghanistan continue to be 
important to Spain because of the deployment of Spanish 
troops in peacekeeping operations in those countries.  The 
Spanish Council of Ministers authorized the sending of 200 
Spanish troops to Haiti as part of a joint Moroccan-Spanish 
battalion on September 10, and the Ministry of Defense has 
said Spanish troops will be operational in Afghanistan by 
September 27.  There will be a report by the UNSG on the 
current situation in Haiti on September 26. 
 
COUNTER-TERRORISM 
 
6.  (C)  Gonzalez de Linares stressed that Spain would like 
to make UNSC efforts more efficient and dynamic.  Former 
Spanish ambassador to the U.S. Javier Ruperez is now the 
Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive 
Directorate at the Assistant Secretary-General level, and 
Spain would like to build on his experience with the issue. 
Yturriaga stressed that the issue of counter-terrorism was 
very important to Spain, but that Spain would likely work 
through committees to promote the issue and that there 
probably would not be UNSC action during their Presidency. 
 
ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA 
 
7.  (U)  The UNSC unanimously adopted UNSCR 1560 to extend 
the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) on September 
14.  Spain along with other UNSC members is concerned about 
the lack of progress in the border demarcation between 
Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
 
OTHER MANDATES 
 
8.  (U)  The UNSC will review mandates in Liberia and Sierra 
Leone before the end of the month.  The UNSG will also 
introduce a report by the end of the month on the next steps 
in Cyprus, and there should also be an update on the UN\'s 
peacekeeping mission in Bougainville. 
 
THE MIDDLE EAST 
 
9.  (C)  Spain will continue to welcome proposals that 
enhance security and stability in the region.  Spain is 
following developments very closely in the recent UNSC 
resolution pressuring Syria to respect Lebanese sovereignty. 
Both Linares de Gonzalez and Yturriaga agreed that 
unanticipated issues concerning the Middle East were likely 
to come before the UNSC during Spain\'s presidency. 
 
SECURITY COUNCIL STRUCTURAL REFORM 
 
10.  (C)  Both Gonzalez de Linares and Yturriaga said that 
Spain supports any UNSC reform that would serve the interests 
of all member states and improve the efficiency of the UNSC. 
Spain does not favor more permanent members of the UNSC, but 
additional nonpermanent members could provide a more 
representative UNSC.  Spain would like to see more 
cooperation between the UNSC, UNGA, and ECOSOC. 
 
11.  (C)  Yturriaga told Poloff that there are differing 
views in the MFA on the issue.  Some members of the MFA want 
permanent UNSC members to only have veto power over issues in 
Chapter 7 of the UN charter; they would like to require at 
least two vetoes by permanent members for all other issues. 
 
12.  (C)  There will be a panel report on UN structural 
reform before December that will include UNSC structural 
reform ideas.  The report likely will fuel discussion on 
possible changes in the UNSC.  Spain does not have an 
official positions on many of the likely reform ideas, but 
there is clearly a lively debate within the MFA over what a 
more representative UNSC would look like.

SUBJECT: SPANISH GOVERNMENT STRONGLY SUPPORTS NEW 
INITIATIVES IN INTERNATIONAL AID 
 
REF: A. STATE 177369 
     B. MADRID 1691 
 
1. Summary: In a delayed response to ref A demarche, 
Technical Advisor Manuel Alhama Orenes in the Cabinet of 
Secretary of State for International Cooperation (aid) Leire 
 
SIPDIS 
Pajin, defined the new position of the GOS on international 
aid as \"anything is possible\".  Spain is now a major 
supporter along with Brazil, France and Chile of new 
international initiatives to end world hunger and guarantee a 
steady, stable increase in international aid to developing 
countries.  In addition to pushing for greater world aid, 
President Zapatero and his Secretary of State for 
International Cooperation Leire Pajin intend to revamp the 
Spanish aid program, increasing Spanish aid from 
approximately .25% of GDP to .50% of GDP, and redirect aid 
from Spain\'s 32 priority countries, mainly middle income 
countries in Latin America and North Africa to the world\'s 
poorest countries.  End Summary. 
 
GOS Strongly Supports New International Aid Initiatives 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
2. We delivered ref A demarche August 30 to several members 
of Spain\'s Agency for International Development and Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs.  We requested a response in early 
September as the GOS began to return from the long August 
break.  We received a response September 16 from Technical 
Advisor Manuel Alhama Orenes in the Cabinet of Secretary of 
State for International Cooperation (aid) Leire Pajin. 
Alhama\'s answer did not directly address our concerns, but 
provided a general GOS position on international aid issues. 
 
3. Alhama began by pointing out that in recent years 
developing countries have not achieved the 3% level of GDP 
growth that would alleviate poverty and hunger.  Spain is now 
one of the chief proponents of new initiatives to provide 
more assistance to meet this goal together with Brazil, 
France and Chile.  The GOS is also willing to consider a tax 
on commerce and international arms sales to raise money for 
new development initiatives. 
 
4. Alhama said the GOS is interested in ensuring a stable, 
predictable flow of international assistance to developing 
countries so that governments can plan for development needs. 
 In this effort, Spain is interested in considering all 
options and initiatives that will increase the level of 
international assistance and funds flowing to poor countries. 
 Alhama emphasized that the new initiatives were voluntary 
and only those countries wishing to participate in the new 
endeavors would do so. 
 
5. Alhama barely touched on specific concerns in our 
demarche.  He noted that the GOS is also concerned with 
transparency of developing governments, but that we should 
not allow this issue to cloud the overall debate on aid and 
need to ensure greater availability of funds to developing 
countries.  He described the U.S. concerns on taxation and 
fiscal issues as unfounded, and mentioned that these issues 
would be studied as possibilities and that the international 
system of trade would remain open. 
 
Changes in Spanish Aid Policy 
----------------------------- 
 
7. Spain\'s Socialist government plans a significant increase 
in aid disbursements and reorientation of aid to poorer 
countries (Ref B).  President Zapatero and his Secretary of 
State for International Cooperation Leire Pajin have promised 
to double Spanish assistance from approximately .25% of GDP 
to 0.5% of GDP in the next four years, and to achieve 0.7% if 
Zapatero\'s government is reelected to a second four year 
term.  Much of this new funding will be granted to the 
world\'s poorest countries, especially those in Sub Saharan 
Africa.  Spain\'s aid is currently channeled assistance to 32 
priority countries, mostly middle income countries in Latin 
America and north Africa where Spain had historical ties or 
foreign policy interests. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. The support of the new international aid initiatives by 
Spain marks a major change in Spanish aid policy, at least 
rhetorically.  One of the major drivers of this change is the 
new Secretary of State for International Cooperation Leire 
Pajin.  At twenty-eight, Pajin is the youngest Secretary of 
State (Undersecretary equivalent) in the Spanish government. 
In 2000, she won a seat in Parliament.  She also held the 
post of Secretary for Social Movements and Relations with 
NGOs on the Socialist Party\'s Federal Executive Commission, 
as well as the presidency of the Spanish NGO Solidarid 
Internacional (Solidarity International).  She is believed to 
be close to President Zapatero.  We will be monitoring 
closely possible changes Spain might make with respect to 
recipient countries and international aid initiatives.  The 
government\'s upcoming budget proposal in early October will 
also be a concrete indicator of whether the GOS will, in 
fact, increase overall aid levels despite fiscal constraints.

SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR SECURITY ADVISORY OPINION 
 
1. Post requests an advisory opinion in the case of Ryan Air 
pilots applying for C1/D and B1/B2 visas to work in the 
United States for a six month period. Over the past year, 
Madrid has seen several cases of pilots requesting visas for 
six weeks of training, followed by approximately 5 months of 
flying, based in airports in the United States. Ryan Air 
usually submits letters requesting B1/B2 visas for spouses 
and children of the pilots as well, indicating that they are 
indeed living in the United States. 
 
2. When Conoff contacted Ryan Air contact C. David Ray, Vice 
President of Operations for Ryan Air in Wichita, KS, she was 
told that while there was supposedly a training aspect of 
these trips to the US, \"they actually work from day one,\" 
based usually in airports in Minneapolis and Milwaukee 
flying to the Caribbean. The idea is that they would be in 
B1/B2 status while in the United States, and in C1/D status 
while flying. 
 
3. Please advise the appropriate visa category for the above 
work. With clear work responsibilities and residence in the 
United States, even for a limited period of time, these 
foreign pilots are providing a constant source of labor for 
Ryan Air, without being subject to the restrictions on 
foreign labor set by the Immigration and Nationality Act.

1. Post recently realized that, due to an internal 
processing error, our consular agents\' evaluations in the 
year 2003 were not properly submitted and, consequently, 
the employees did not receive the step increase they 
should have earned that year. 
 
2. Our files show that in the year 2003 only one consular 
agent\'s evaluation was properly completed while all the 
other five were prepared and signed by the Counselor for 
Consular Affairs but were never processed.  All of the 
agents did perform at the satisfactory or better level 
that year. 
 
3. We were unaware of the situation until recently 
because the Consular Agents do not have access to 
Intranet and have difficulty accessing their pay records. 
Our consular agents\' pay records are also inaccessible 
to Madrid HR and CONS. 
 
4. We have now completed all six 2003 evaluations and

recommendation to give the consular agents the 
appropriate retroactive step increases.

SUBJECT: SPANISH OFFICIALS REACT TO PRESIDENT BUSH REMARKS 
ON IRAQ WITHDRAWAL 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires J. Robert Manzanares, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Spanish officials have reacted defensively to 
President Bush\'s remarks concerning Spain\'s withdrawal from 
Iraq, made at his September 23 joint press conference with 
Iraqi Interim Prime Minister Allawi.  During a courtesy call 
by Charge and Econcouns September 24, the MFA\'s Director 
General for Europe and North America, Jose Maria Pons, said 
the Spanish government was \"surprised\" by President Bush\'s 
remarks, and the Spanish government is doing a \"quick 
analysis\" of the comments.  He added that Zapatero never 
mentioned the United States by name in his comments in Tunis. 
(Note:  On September 9 in Tunis, Zapatero said the situation 
in Iraq would improve if other countries were to withdraw 
their troops as Spain did.  End note.)  Pons reminded Charge 
and Econcouns that every Friday the Council of Ministers 
meets and First Vice President de la Vega gives a press 
conference afterward.  He expected de la Vega to comment on 
President Bush\'s remarks. 
 
2.  (SBU) At the press conference following the Council of 
Ministers meeting, de la Vega was rather controlled, saying 
\"Our decision to withdraw the troops was made with the 
overwhelming support of the Spanish people, and was announced 
months  before the attacks in Madrid.  We have three decades 
of experience fighting ETA, Grapa and al Qaeda.  We will 
continue to do so firmly and consistent with national and 
international law.\"  She concluded by saying the Spanish 
government would not formally protest the president\'s remarks. 
 
3.  (SBU) But the Socialist Party\'s spokesperson on 
Congress\'s foreign affairs committee, Rafael Estrella 
(normally a strong supporter of close U.S.-Spain relations), 
reacted in a less measured fashion, telling the press \"what 
Bush said is untrue, because the withdrawal of Spanish troops 
(from Iraq) was a commitment of the Socialist Party in the 
event the UN did not assume responsibility for the situation 
in Iraq.  Since this did not happen, it was decided to 
withdraw the troops.\"  According to Estrella, it wasn\'t the 
withdrawal of Spanish troops that \"emboldened the terrorists\" 
in Iraq because \"before the war and the invasion there was no 
terrorism there.\"  It has been the \"illegal war and the way 
in which political change has occurred that has plunged the 
country into chaos and is fueling terrorism.\"  Bush should 
\"correct\" his policies in Iraq rather than \"transfer 
responsibility to those who have fulfilled their campaign 
promises consistent with international law.\" 
 
4.  (U) President Zapatero thus far has not reacted to 
President Bush\'s comments. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  The Zapatero government and the Socialist 
Party remain intensely sensitive to the charge that the 
Socialists won the March 14 election as a result of the March 
11 terrorist attacks in Madrid.  In that sense it is little 
surprise Spanish officials -- even the normally pro-U.S. 
Estrella -- have reacted defensively to the president\'s 
comments.

SUBJECT: SPAIN\'S ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CHALLENGE 
 
REF: MADRID 2418 
 
1. (U) Summary.  The GOS has announced a plan to revise its 
Law on Foreign Aliens (Ley de Extranjeria) to grant legal 
status to undocumented immigrants who can demonstrate that 
they have worked a minimum of one year in Spain. The GOS is 
acting in response to a massive increase in illegal 
immigration to Spain (mainly from Morocco) since 2003.  The 
plan would require immigrants to declare their illegal status 
and identify their employers and make businesses pay 
retroactive social security benefits for the illegal 
immigrants that they employ.  Officials say their plan would 
resolve immigration problems created by the former Popular 
Party (PP) government and fulfill the Socialist party\'s 
(PSOE) campaign promise to improve Spain\'s labor market. 
Opponents contend that the plan excludes the majority of 
temporary out-of-status workers and will instead increase 
illegal immigration and fraud in Spain and in other parts of 
the European Union.  The GOS expects to reach quick consensus 
on the plan; however, criticism from immigrant groups, 
businesses, labor, and the EU could unravel the plan before 
it goes to congress in October.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Spain:  The Immigration Challenge 
--------------------------------- 
 
Illegal Immigrant flow 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) Immigration poses a challenge to Spain\'s efforts to 
secure its borders, curb underground economic activity, and 
formulate policy to meet the demands of thousands of 
undocumented workers already in Spain.  The government 
estimates that there are approximately 2.7 million immigrants 
in Spain including as many as one million illegal immigrants. 
 Immigrants now make up approximately 6.2 percent of Spain\'s 
total population of 42.7 million, but according to EU 
statistics, last year Spain received the largest number of 
new immigrants in Europe, 594,300 or 23 percent of all new 
immigrants to the European Union.  The majority of new 
immigrants entered illegally through the Spanish coastal 
cities of Cadiz, Malaga, and Almeria, the Canary Islands, or 
by crossing from Morocco into the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta 
and Melilla. 
 
3. (U) The Spanish National Guard reported in August that it 
interdicted 412 illegal immigrant boats (called \"pateras\" in 
Spanish).  These interdictions led to the arrest of more than 
10,042 illegal immigrants, a nine percent decline in the 
number arrested in 2003 according to officials.  Of the total 
number of persons arrested, there were 6,256 Moroccans, 1,500 
Malians, 900 Gambians; others were nationals of West African 
and Latin American countries, notably Honduras.  Officials 
rescued 171 illegal immigrants, while fifty-three persons 
drowned and 35 \"disappeared\" in Mediterranean waters.   The 
arrival of numerous pateras this summer made national news 
headlines and raised concerns over the status of 
undocumented, illegal immigrant workers in Spain as well as 
the porous nature of Spain\'s southern border. 
 
Labor & Economic issues 
----------------------- 
 
4. (U) There are 800,000 to one million illegal immigrants on 
temporary work contracts in Spain, according to statistics 
from the Spanish Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.  The 
labor ministry also estimates that immigrants filled four out 
of ten new jobs created in Spain in 2003.  The most recent 
data on immigrant employment from 2003 shows that immigrants 
from Colombia and Ecuador held 40.6 percent of all temporary 
contract jobs while the percentage of temporary immigrant 
workers from Eastern Europe, Asia, and other EU countries has 
declined. 
 
5. (U) Immigrant workers support a massive informal or 
\"underground\" economy according to recent economic studies 
(reftel).  Economists suggest that informal economic activity 
accounts for 23 percent of Spain\'s GDP and approximately 120 
billion euros (USD 143 billion) in unreported economic 
earnings.  They suggest that the participation of illegal 
immigrant workers in the underground economy has increased 
substantially since 2001.   Reducing unreported economic 
activity and employment of illegal immigrants is a key 
concern for the GOS because of its efforts to link 
immigration policy to improvements in the labor and economic 
conditions. 
 
---------- 
GOS Policy 
---------- 
 
Under the former PP government 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (U) In response to the challenge of illegal immigration 
and undocumented immigrant workers, the former Popular Party 
(PP) government passed measures under Spain\'s Law on Foreign 
Aliens (Ley de Extranjeria) before leaving office that 
required undocumented immigrants to have three years of 
residence in Spain before they could obtain legal resident 
status.  The measures also restricted immigrants from joining 
political parties and labor unions.  In recent months, 
immigrant groups in Madrid and Barcelona have protested the 
law arguing that it has left nearly 100,000 immigrants 
without work permits and denied them the right to free 
association or the ability to negotiate better work 
contracts.  They demanded that the new Socialist government 
reject the PP measures by rescinding the Law on Foreign 
Aliens and expediting work visas that would give legal status 
in Spain to all undocumented workers and their family members. 
 
The Socialists, new proposal 
----------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Developing a policy to integrate immigrants into the 
labor market and manage the flow of illegal immigrants were 
priorities of the Spanish Socialist\'s (PSOE) electoral 
program.  On September 14, Spain\'s Minister of Labor and 
Social Affairs, Jesus Caldera, formally presented the GOS\'s 
plan on illegal immigration to a congressional committee on 
economic and social affairs.   Caldera proposed granting 
legal status only to those undocumented immigrants who 
demonstrated work ties to Spain for a minimum of one year and 
physically resided in Spain for a yet-undetermined time 
period. 
 
8.  (U) The new proposal involves a one-time immigration 
process, which Caldera called \"normalization,\" that would 
result in renewable, one year work permits for those 
undocumented immigrants currently in Spain who met labor 
legislation requirements.  Under the proposed requirements, 
illegal immigrants would have to reveal their employers 
voluntarily and prove that they had been working for them 
illegally for a minimum of one year to receive work permits 
and temporary resident status.  Companies guilty of hiring 
illegal immigrants would be required to pay social security 
taxes retroactively for the immigrant\'s period of employment. 
 Newly arrived immigrants, or those that lack employment 
history or domiciles (so-called \"clandestine\" immigrants) 
would not be eligible for normalization, according to 
Minister Caldera.  Caldera issued a report to the 
congressional committee outlining the new policy and said 
that proposal would be open to debate by all parliamentary 
groups, political parties, businesses, and labor unions.  He 
was optimistic that the new plan would be approved by 
congress in October. 
 
---------- 
Criticisms 
---------- 
 
9.  (U) The GOS\'s new plan has been sharply criticized by the 
opposition Popular Party and was met with mixed reviews by 
labor union leaders as well as the EU Immigration Commission. 
 PP Secretary General Mariano Rajoy said the plan amounted to 
\"papers for all\" illegal immigrants and argued that the 
proposal would benefit clandestine immigrants and criminal 
mafias.  PP immigration spokesperson Angeles Munoz reiterated 
the charge that the government\'s proposal was another attempt 
by the ruling Socialist party to \"radically change the 
policies put in place by the PP.\"   Munoz said the 
government\'s normalization policy would exclude the majority 
of out-of-status contract workers because only 8% of such 
workers have contracts that last more than a year. 
 
10. (U) Some labor unions and immigrant associations have 
also questioned the normalization criteria in Caldera\'s 
proposal.  Immigration spokesperson for the Commissiones 
Obreras (CCOO) labor union Lola Granados added that most 
agriculture, hotel, and domestic services require contracts 
that last less then a year, so the proposal\'s one-year work 
requirement would not help many immigrant workers in these 
industries.  A spokesperson for the Association of Moroccan 
Immigrant Workers in Spain (ATIME) rejected the one-year 
formula and the requirement to reveal illegal hiring 
practices.  ATIME said the government should have consulted 
with immigrant groups to establish consensus on the criteria 
for normalization before they announced the plan in congress. 
 The General Worker\'s Union (UGT) expressed the concern that 
any changes in Spain immigration policy that did not 
strengthen immigrants\' labor rights would give immigrants 
false expectations. 
 
11. (U) Vice President of the European Commission on 
Immigration, Loyola de Palacio, expressed the EU\'s concern in 
August that Spain\'s proposal would increase illegal 
immigration to other regions of the EU.  Palacio commented 
that under the new Spanish proposal, illegal immigrants in 
Spain could use temporary work status to emigrate to other 
parts of Europe Union where they would face equally uncertain 
job prospects.  This concern was reiterated by the Catalan 
Convergence and Union (CiU) party, which suggested that Spain 
also impose measures to prevent illegal immigrants from using 
their temporary residence status under the normalization plan 
to emigrate to other European countries, specifically those 
within the Schengen visa space. 
 
-------- 
Comment 
-------- 
 
12. (U) As the largest net recipient of immigrants in Europe, 
Spain is the gateway into Europe for immigrants from North 
Africa and Latin America.  Although the GOS contends that its 
proposed plan will resolve the backlog of undocumented 
immigrant cases and curb illegal employment in Spain\'s 
underground economy, the plan does not appear reasonable for 
businesses, labor unions, and illegal immigrants alike.  The 
new measures would penalize businesses for hiring illegal 
workers by making them pay retroactive social security tax 
and may cause illegal immigrants to lose their jobs if they 
inform on their employers.  The proposal also fails to 
address labor concerns on whether illegal immigrants can join 
unions or protect their employment status if they hold 
contracts for less than a year.  In addition, the GOS 
proposal could create an unintended pull effect of new 
immigrants into Spain and create problems with the EU on 
coordinating common immigration policies.  The GOS proposal 
in its present form may not survive a robust domestic debate 
among businesses, unions, and immigrants groups and could 
generate greater uncertainty about the direction of Spain\'s 
immigration policies within the European Union.

SUBJECT: SPANISH BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS: THE CATALAN POSITION 
 
 
1. Summary: Budget negotiations between the Catalan regional 
government and the central government will be a key challenge 
during the budgeting season which begins in earnest this 
week.  The three parties currently in the Catalan government 
are unified in seeking increased funding for the regional 
health plan, a long term increase in Catalonia\'s share of 
regional government revenue and guarantees of increased 
infrastructure investment from Madrid.  The Catalan 
government ultimately hopes to obtain a share of the regional 
budget that more closely reflects its 16% share of the 
Spanish population and 19% of Spain\'s GDP, than the roughly 
15% it now receives.  This money could come either from 
ceding of more tax monies by the central government or direct 
transfers from Madrid.  The Catalan government believes it is 
in a strong bargaining position because the Socialist 
government in Madrid lacks a majority in Parliament and will 
need the votes of Catalonia\'s regional parties to pass the 
2005 budget by the end of the year.  However, the delicate 
balance between the competing demands of other regional 
governments and the regional parties in Parliament will be 
challenging.  End Summary. 
 
2. Looking ahead to the hard negotiations that will take 
place between the central government and the autonomous 
regional governments on their share of Spain\'s national 
budget, visiting Madrid Econoff and ConGen Barcelona Pol/Econ 
Specialist met September 20 with the Catalan regional 
government\'s Secretary General of Economy and Finance Marti 
Carnicer to discuss the Catalan position in the budget 
debate.  The Catalan regional government is one of the 
regions making the strongest demands for more money from 
Madrid.  Carnicer told us that the three governing parties in 
the Catalan regional government share the same overall goals 
of covering the health program deficit, increasing the amount 
of money received from Madrid, and increasing investment in 
infrastructure.  Carnicer provided a justification of why 
Catalonia should receive a greater share of the national 
budget and explained why the current political situation 
provides the best opportunity for a budgetary reconfiguration 
in Catalonia\'s favor. 
 
CURRENT SYSTEM OF FINANCING 
--------------------------- 
 
3. The current financing plan for 15 of the 17 autonomous 
regional governments is known as the common system and was 
negotiated in 2001 between the autonomous regional 
governments and the then ruling Popular Party government. 
The plan cedes a percentage of taxes collected by the central 
government in each region to its regional government:  33% of 
personal income tax, 35% of the value added tax and 40% of 
the special taxes on alcohol, tobacco and hydrocarbons. 
Autonomous governments receive 100% of the funds from taxes 
on property and assets, inheritance, assignments, gambling, 
vehicle registration and electricity levied within their 
region.  Regional governments also receive a direct transfer 
called the Sufficiency Fund from the central government 
budget to the regional governments to cover expenses not met 
by the tax cessions. 
 
4. Under this system, the Catalan government received 12.1 
billion Euros (USD 14.8 billion) in revenue in 2002 (the last 
year with complete budget figures).  Tax income provided 84% 
of Catalonia\'s revenue and Sufficiency Fund transfers 
contributed the additional 16% of 2002 revenue.  The average 
regional budget is composed of 68% tax revenue and 32% 
central government transfers.  With this financing system, 
the Catalan government is expected to have a 2003 deficit of 
EUR 723 million (USD 887 million) once the accounts are fully 
reconciled.  Roughly EUR 600 million (USD 737 million) of 
this deficit is from the public health service. 
 
BUDGETARY GOALS OF THE CATALAN GOVERNMENT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. Secretary General Carnicer described the broad goals that 
the three parties in the Catalan government (Socialist Party 
of Catalonia--PSC, the Republican Left of Catalonia*ERC and 
the Initiative for a Green Catalonia--ICV) agree on in the 
budget negotiation with Madrid.  The most pressing issue is 
obtaining immediate funding for the Catalan public health 
program to alleviate its large deficit.  In the medium term, 
the goal is to achieve a revision in the budgetary process 
that improves Catalonia\'s long-term revenue.  One proposal is 
to request a greater percentage of taxes collected in 
Catalonia; the Catalan Counselor for Economy Castells has 
publicly proposed raising from 35%-40% the amount of value 
added tax transferred to the autonomous regions.  Another 
option is securing a long-term increase in central government 
transfers through the Sufficiency Fund or special transfers 
to cover health care expenses.  Finally, all the parties 
agree on the need for greater central government investment 
in infrastructure projects in Catalonia, particularly the 
completion of the high-speed train connection between Madrid 
and Barcelona and improvements to the Barcelona airport. 
 
6. When asked about how much money the Catalan government was 
seeking, Carnicer pointed out that 16% of Spain\'s population 
lives in Catalonia and that Catalonia produces 19% of Spain\'s 
GDP.  The three parties therefore expect to receive a 
percentage of all autonomous government revenue somewhere 
between those two numbers, rather than the current share of 
about 15%.  We also asked Carnicer about the perception that 
PSC and ERC might have different goals, considering that the 
ERC leader Carod-Rovira recently made a personal visit to 
Madrid to meet with Spanish President Zapatero to push for 
19%.  Carnicer assured us that there were no key differences 
between the three parties, though their negotiating tactics 
might differ and some specific issues might be of greater 
concern to one party than another.  He mentioned that the PSC 
is focusing on health and infrastructure, and that ERC would 
like to see increased funding in Catalan language programs. 
NOW IS THE TIME 
--------------- 
 
7. Carnicer told us that the Catalan government is in a 
strong negotiating position, and that the Catalan government 
believes now is the opportune time to obtain additional 
funding.  He noted that the three-party government is a 
strong one and willing to fight for its needs during budget 
negotiations.  Catalonia\'s budgetary goals are agreed on by a 
large majority of the population and almost 85% of the 
deputies in the Catalan parliament (the three governing 
parties plus the former governing party Convergencia i 
Union).  The national government is a \"gobierno amigo\" or 
friendly government.  The tri-partite Socialist led coalition 
was elected in November 2003 and the new Socialist led 
government in Madrid was elected in March 2004.  This is the 
first time in 24 years of Spanish democracy in which both the 
Catalan regional government and the national government have 
been of the same party.  Friendly atmospherics aside, 
Carnicer also noted that the national government needed all 
of the Catalan votes to pass the national budget, as Zapatero 
governs without an absolute majority.  Finally, Carnicer 
pointed out that the autonomous regions of Catalonia and 
Andalusia provided many of the votes that allowed the 
Socialists to take power in Madrid.  For all of these 
reasons, the Catalan parties will push for and expect to 
receive a change in regional finances that favors Catalonia. 
 
8. Comment: The Catalan government is in a strong position to 
make demands during the negotiations for the 2005 Spanish 
Budget.  President Zapatero\'s government does not have a 
majority in Parliament and will need the Catalan votes to 
pass his budget.  As the first budget of Zapatero\'s 
administration, it is likely that the national government 
will compromise and work hard to pass a budget with a broad 
range of support by regional parties.  Catalonia is probably 
the autonomous region with the strongest bargaining power due 
to its size and the alignment of its Socialist-led government 
with the national government.  Catalonia is likely to gain a 
significant increase in revenue from the budget negotiations. 
 However, the delicate task of balancing Catalonia\'s increase 
with demands of other regions in a budgeting environment of 
high aspirations but fiscal limits will be a major challenge 
for Zapatero\'s budget negotiators.

SUBJECT: SPAIN SUPPORTS EU ROAD MAP ON NORMALIZING LIBYA 
RELATIONS 
 
REF: STATE 207640 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen Fitzpatrick for Reasons 1.4 
 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Poloff delivered reftel talking points to 
Enrique Mora Benavente, Head of EU Planning at the MFA, on 
September 29.  Mora Benavente told Poloff that Spain favors 
the four-step European \"road map\" to normalized relations and 
economic cooperation with Libya.  The four-step process 
includes:  (1) the partial lifting of the arms embargo with 
Libya to allow for the sale of border control equipment, (2) 
the complete lifting of the arms embargo, (3) the 
normalization of relations with Libya, including accession to 
the Barcelona Process, and (4) increased trade and economic 
relations.  To reach each step Libya would have to achieve 
certain benchmarks linked to settlement of terrorist claims 
or human rights improvements.  Mora Benavente was unaware of 
any recent terrorist activities of Libya.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (C)  The first step of the EU \"road map\" for Libya which 
will be discussed at the GAERC meetings on October 11 
includes the partial lifting of the arms embargo to allow for 
border control equipment to stem the flow of illegal 
immigration.  The EU will likely take this first step as a 
result of the progress they have seen recently in Libya\'s 
efforts to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) 
program.  Spain and other EU members would be willing to lift 
the arms embargo against Libya as a second step provided that 
two conditions are met.  First, Libya must settle with the EU 
victims of Lockerbie and LaBelle.  Second, the EU must firmly 
be convinced that Libya has abandoned its pursuit of a WMDs 
program; this would include confirmation from the 
International Atomic Energy Association concerning the status 
of Libya\'s nuclear programs. 
 
3.  (C)  The third step of the \"road map\", the normalization 
of relations with Libya, would be connected to the resolution 
of the Bulgarian medics issue. Mora Benavente said that many 
EU states are convinced that Libya has made the strategic 
decision to become a normal member of the world community. 
This step could include Libya\'s entering the Barcelona 
Process where members pledge to promote and strengthen peace, 
stability and security in the Mediterranean region.  The 
fourth step of the \"road map\" would be the negotiating 
economic and political reform that could eventually lead to a 
trade agreement and increased economic cooperation.  As an 
aside, Mora Benavente added that the Syrian government is 
currently involved in negotiations to achieve increased 
economic cooperation with the EU. 
 
4.  (C)  When Poloff told Mora Benavente that the U.S. still 
had serious concerns regarding Libya\'s role in terrorist 
activities, he said that according to Spanish information, 
the Libyan government had given up support of terrorism. 
When asked about the alleged involvement of Libya in the 2003 
assassination plot against Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, Mora 
Benavente responded that the plot was an internal Arab 
problem and not likely the deliberate actions of the Libyan 
govenment; he compared the plot to an attempted mafia hit. 
 
5.  (C)  Mora Benavente said that the GOS shares many of the 
concerns of the USG and that is the reason that benchmarks 
are incorporated at each stage of the process of the 
normalization of relations.  He conceded that there were no 
benchmarks related to terrorist activities, but he reiterated 
that many EU states believe that Libya has made the strategic 
decision to abandon both the pursuit of WMDs and terrorist 
activity.  He added that some nations like Italy and the 
United Kingdom would like to see the EU move quickly on this 
issue, while other nations, including many Nordic countries, 
would like to see the EU be more deliberate in its approach 
due to human rights concerns.

(S) EconOff spoke on 10/1/04 with MFA SubDirector for the 
Near East, Alberto Moreno, re: the new Iraq Executive Order. 
Moreno said that the Order was \"good\".  However, the GOS does 
not plan at the moment to change and/or introduce legislation 
along the lines of the U.S. Iraq Executive Order.  Morenos 
said the GOS would welcome information from the U.S. on 
specific cases of Spain-related Iraq insurgency financing. 
He noted, however, that even with the \"best will in the 
world\", there was no \"mechanism\" in Spain to block financing 
for \"insurgents\", unless one could also show that said 
\"insurgents\" also supported and/or were terrorists.  He 
mentioned the example of Moqtada al Sadr, clearly an 
insurgent, but somebody the Iraqui government might want to 
include in a political settlement.  Morenos said his comments 
were the GOS position on the Iraq Executive Order.

A.  HIV INFECTION RATE CONTINUES TO DECLINE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  The Health Ministry announced that 2,190 persons were 
diagnosed as carrying the HIV virus in 2003, a 5.2 percent 
decline from the 2,311 new infections reported in 2002. 
Approximately half of the new infections were believed to 
have been caused by drug addicts sharing syringes.  The 
infection rate peaked in 1994 with 7,401 new infections 
diagnosed.  The Health Ministry acknowledged, however, that 
its figures under-report the \"real\" infection rate, which 
some claim could be as high as approximately 4,000 new 
infections a year.  Perhaps even more alarming, the Ministry 
reported that 60 percent of those diagnosed with AIDS had 
been unaware that they had been carrying the HIV virus.  This 
supports the arguments of those who believe Spain\'s official 
HIV infection rate underestimates the true gravity of the 
nation\'s HIV/AIDS situation. 
 
--------------------- 
B.  EUTHANASIA DEBATE 
--------------------- 
 
4.  Vice President Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, Spain\'s 
number two ranking leader, told a press conference that her 
Socialist Party Government would not/not soon propose the 
legalization of euthanasia, given that it is a \"complicated 
and very delicate subject\" on which there is \"no social 
consensus.\"  Other PSOE leaders supported de la Vega, but 
indicated that the ruling party would propose that the issue 
be debated in Congress.  Euthanasia in Spain has received 
much attention in the aftermath of an award winning Spanish 
film (\"The Sea Within\") portraying one man\'s battle with the 
State for permission to be euthanized.  Article 143 of the 
Spanish Penal Code proscribes punishments of six to ten years 
for persons who assist others to die.  However, the same 
article permits lesser sentences in cases where it was clear 
that the deceased consented and had been suffering from a 
terminal condition.  Many persons within the ruling PSOE and 
some of Spain\'s smaller leftist parties have long pressed for 
changing Article 143 to decriminalize euthanasia.  De la 
Vega\'s comments appear to rule that out, at least for now. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
c.  46 PERCENT OF SPAIN\'S CHILDREN OBESE OR OVERWEIGHT 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5.  A study released by the \"Spanish Society for the Study of 
Obesity\" reported that 16 percent of Spanish children between 
the ages of six and 12 suffered from obesity, a five-fold 
increase over the past 20 years.  The obesity rate of 
children in Spain has now reportedly surpassed that of adults 
(14.5 percent).  An additional 30 percent of Spanish children 
were considered overweight.  According to the study, within 
the EU, only the United Kingdom (18 percent) has a higher 
child obesity rate than Spain.  Health Minister Elena Salgado 
was reported to be \"very worried\" by the results of the 
study.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, ELAB, SP 
SUBJECT: UNIONS PROTEST GOS PLAN FOR SAVING FAILING 
SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY 
 
REF: MADRID 3105 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  Zapatero\'s Socialist (PSOE) government is 
facing its first labor crisis since taking office in April, 
as shipyard workers in five cities stage unruly protests and 
block traffic to protest GOS backing of a restructuring plan 
that will lead to significant layoffs.  The heart of the 
issue is the inability of state-owned Izar Shipyards to 
compete with Asian shipbuilders and a demand by the European 
Commission (EC) that Spain repay at least USDOLS 370 million 
-- and possibly over USDOLS 1.35 billion -- in allegedly 
illegal subsidies provided to Izar in recent years by the 
previous Popular Party (PP) government.  Labor frustrations 
burst into violent demonstrations in Cadiz and Vizcaya after 
Zapatero pledged to help workers, then subsequently announced 
his support for a company plan to split and partially 
privatize the failing enterprise, a plan that will result in 
job losses.  A labor representative, who was preparing for a 
trip to the U.S. as an International Visitor grantee, told us 
the violence was regrettable, but indicative of the fear felt 
by Izar\'s 11,000 workers and 30,000 workers in affiliated 
industries.  The GOS extracted a temporary reprieve from the 
EC regarding repayment of the illegal subsidies, taking the 
punch out of opposition arguments that the PSOE was acting on 
behalf of Brussels rather than Spanish workers.  The GOS also 
put on hold its plans to divide the company while talks with 
the unions are underway.  Unfortunately for Zapatero, there 
is no solution that will both save all Izar jobs and satisfy 
the EC that the GOS has ceased its illegal subsidies.  Any 
viable solution is likely to incite another round of labor 
unrest.  End Summary. 
 
//AN UNWELCOME CONFRONTATION WITH LABOR// 
 
2. (U) The Zapatero administration has attempted to shift the 
blame for the crisis to the PP for making the allegedly 
illegal payments to Izar, but PSOE remains on the defensive. 
All political parties except the PSOE joined a Congressional 
resolution calling on Zapatero to set aside the restructuring 
plan and demand lenient terms from the EC.  Zapatero\'s 
government is attempting to do just that, but in the end the 
only question is how, not if, a large number of Izar 
employees will be removed from government payrolls. 
 
//LAST GASP OF A DYING INDUSTRY// 
 
3. (U) Over the last two decades, Spain\'s centuries-old 
shipbuilding industry has lost 30,000 jobs in a struggle for 
economic survival against Asian competitors, particularly 
South Korea.  In 2000, the GOS folded its two remaining 
shipbuilding companies into a single company known as Izar as 
part of an effort to streamline the industry, but  Izar has 
never shown a profit.  Izar\'s 11,000 employees are now in 
danger of losing their jobs. 
 
4. (SBU) It is the misfortune of the Zapatero administration 
that the final crisis has come on its watch.  The Izar issue 
is coming to a head now in part because the opposition 
Popular Party (PP) delayed the inevitable by propping up the 
company through more than 1 billion euros (USDOLS 1.2 
billion) in state funds, funds the European Commission (EC) 
has declared to be illegal subsidies and is now demanding 
Izar pay back to the GOS and the EU.  The GOS estimates that 
if the parastatal company that owns Izar, Sociedad Estatal de 
Participaciones Industriales (SEPI), is forced to repay the 
full amount of illegal subsidies, Izar will go bankrupt 
within four months.  To avert the total collapse of Izar, 
SEPI proposed separating the relatively viable military 
construction shipyards from the foundering civilian vessel 
shipyards and privatizing the civilian facilities.  It is 
this SEPI survival strategy that has triggered violent 
protests by Izar workers throughout Spain and drawn Zapatero 
into an unwelcome conflict with labor. 
 
//BACKGROUND TO THE CRISIS// 
 
5. (U) Thoughout its first term, Aznar\'s PP government 
maintained good working relations with labor unions and 
focused economic policy on job creation, dovetailing with 
union objectives for dealing with Spain\'s chronic high 
unemployment.  After taking office in 1996, Aznar continued 
GOS support for a plan by the previous PSOE government to 
restructure the publicly owned shipyard industry, an 
initiative that had the support of all major Spanish labor 
unions.  The plan was intended to wean the shipyards away 
from state funding and require them to reduce labor and 
manufacturing costs. 
 
6. (U) In 1997, the European Commission (EC) approved 
restructuring aid for the GOS-owned Spanish military 
shipbuilder Astilleros Espanoles, S.A. and the GOS-owned 
civilian shipbuilder Empresa Nacional Bazan amounting to EUR 
1.38 billion (USDOLS 1.69 billion).  EU funds were provided 
on the condition that no further subsidies would be provided 
to the companies. 
 
7. (U) However, both companies failed to meet the objectives 
of the GOS restructuring plan and remained unprofitable.  In 
1999, Aznar\'s PP government authorized state-owned SEPI to 
grant EUR 500 million (USDOLS 615 million) in further aid to 
Bazan, assistance that eventually included SEPI\'s purchase of 
Bazan at allegedly above-market value.  SEPI then purchased 
Astilleros in December 2000, forming Izar as Spain\'s last 
major civil and military shipbuilding company.  Izar employs 
11,000 shipbuilders in six cities throughout the country and 
36,000 workers in related industries. 
 
8. (U) The European Commission launched an investigation in 
2000 to determine whether Aznar\'s assistance to Bazan and 
Astilleros constituted a violation of its 1997 agreement to 
provide restructuring aid.  While the EC investigation was 
underway, the GOS provided another EUR 560 million (USDOLS 
688 million) in subsidies to Izar.  In May 2004, the EC 
determined that Spain\'s 1999 and 2000 assistance to the 
shipbuilders through SEPI and subsequent subsidies to Izar 
provided Spanish companies an uncompetitive advantage over 
other EU shipbuilders.  The EC found that Izar must 
immediately repay EUR 308 million (USDOLS 378 million) and 
perhaps eventually up to EUR 1.1 billion (USDOLS 1.35 
billion) in illegal assistance. 
 
//LAST-DITCH SURVIVAL PLAN// 
 
9. (SBU) In an effort to salvage what it can of the industry, 
SEPI has proposed dividing the civilian and military 
shipyards into two sets of companies, keeping the military 
shipyards (4 out of Izar\'s 10 facilities) under state 
ownership and privatizing the civilian shipyards.  The PSOE 
government has also ramped up efforts to secure military 
sales for the remaining shipyards.  SEPI is banking on Izar\'s 
relatively stable orders for military vessels to provide 
employment for at least several thousand Izar employees. 
(NOTE: One news report suggested that a recent Israeli 
decision to withdraw orders from Izar for two naval vessels 
was linked to USG displeasure with Zapatero\'s withdrawal of 
Spanish troops from Iraq.  END NOTE.)  The fate of workers in 
civilian shipyards would be far less certain. 
 
 
10. (U) Shipyard workers met the SEPI plan with hostility 
from the outset and have staged sometimes violent strikes to 
make their position clear.  Workers are against any division 
of the company or privatization of either the civilian or 
military sector based on their certainty that privatization 
will bring layoffs.  They want Izar maintained as a single 
entity in order to guarantee that all workers will get the 
same deal. 
 
11. (SBU) Labor\'s mood went from anger to outrage after 
Zapatero, during a visit to the Basque region, quelled a 
demonstration by Izar workers by promising he would stand 
with them, only to do an about-face and endorse the SEPI plan 
three days later.  Workers reacted by announcing increased 
walkouts and temporary strikes.  In Vizcaya and Cadiz, 
workers clashed with police and barricaded roads.  Zapatero\'s 
reversal was cast as a major gaffe by opposition parties and 
the press and a reflection of inexperience and an inability 
to confront difficult issues directly. 
 
12. (SBU) The GOS won a temporary truce with workers on 9/23 
by agreeing to put the SEPI plan on hold while negotiations 
with labor unions are underway, but both sides appear 
entrenched in their positions.  The next day, Minister of the 
Economy Pedro Solbes announced EC approval for a temporary 
reprieve on Izar while the GOS works out a solution with the 
unions.  SEPI and labor union representatives traveled 
together to Brussels on 10/4 for meetings with the EC to 
establish the EC\'s bottom line on the matter.  An EC 
spokesman suggested there could be \"flexibility\" on the 
schedule of repaying illegal subsidies, but only if SEPI\'s 
plan for separating Izar into military and civilian sectors 
were implemented.  The EC estimates that splitting the 
companies will save 9,000 shipbuilder positions.  Labor 
unions have continued intermittent work stoppages to keep up 
pressure on SEPI and the GOS during the negotiations. 
 
//LABOR\'S VIEW// 
 
12. (SBU) Poloff met with Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) Director 
for International Relations Javier Doz on 9/24 to discuss 
union views on the Izar crisis. (NOTE: Doz was preparing to 
depart for the U.S. on 9/25 as an International Visitor 
grantee.  He is a long-standing and excellent contact on 
labor issues.  END NOTE.)  CCOO, a formerly Communist-aligned 
but now independent labor union, represents the largest 
number of shipbuilders and has played a leading role in the 
negotiations with SEPI and the Zapatero government.  He 
explained that Izar workers are divided among all the major 
Spanish unions, guaranteeing a broad base of support for the 
shipbuilders.  Doz said the SEPI plan would probably lead to 
4,500 layoffs out of the total of 11,000 Izar direct-hires 
and to an unknown number of layoffs among the 30,000 workers 
in supporting industries.  He said the outbreaks of violent 
demonstrations were regrettable, but that they reflected the 
fears of workers fighting for their economic lives.  He 
expected Cadiz to be especially restive since a large number 
of workers in related industries in that city depend on Izar. 
 
 
13. (SBU) Doz acknowledged that the long term prospects for 
shipbuilders were bleak, lamenting the fact that 
state-subsidized companies in Korea made Spanish firms that 
played by the rules of international competition unviable. 
However, Doz also noted that Korean firms were quicker to 
adapt to customer needs and were more technologically 
efficient than Spanish shipbuilders.  Doz observed that even 
Izar\'s military shipyards suffer from lack of orders and 
cannot absorb the excess labor in the civilian shipyards.  He 
said the CCOO and other unions were focused on getting the 
best deal they could for workers who will be forced from the 
industry.  That could take the form of buyouts or favorable 
retirement packages, but SEPI and the unions are far from 
reaching any such arrangements. CCOO and the other unions 
also want the GOS to demand lenient terms from the EC, 
pointing out that larger EU countries don\'t refrain from 
pressuring the EC to bend the rules to protect domestic 
labor. 
 
 
//POLITICAL FALLOUT// 
 
14.  (SBU) The demand that the PSOE stand up to the EU is 
aimed squarely at Zapatero, whose key policy foreign policy 
objective has been to \"return Spain to the heart of Europe.\" 
He symbolically achieved this goal in early September, 
hosting Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and President Jaques 
Chirac for a meeting intended to signal a definitive break 
with Aznar\'s focus on transatlantic relations.  The PP and 
other parties are now challenging Zapatero to use Spain\'s 
renewed EU credentials to extract favorable terms from 
Brussels regarding Izar\'s repayment of the illegal subsidies. 
 
15. (SBU) The PSOE has blamed the PP for the Izar crisis 
because the allegedly illegal subsidies took place on Aznar\'s 
watch.  The PP is unapologetic, saying Spanish workers should 
have priority over meeting EU agreements.  Some observers 
have noted that all parties, including the PSOE, knew the PP 
subsidies to Izar were illegal and did nothing to stop them 
because no party wanted to accept responsibility for dooming 
the shipyards.  PSOE made a vain appeal for other parties not 
to politicize the Izar issue, but on 9/21 all parties except 
PSOE supported a congressional resolution calling on the GOS 
to shelve the SEPI plan and demand better terms from the EU. 
The GOS responded that the only realistic choices were the 
SEPI plan or the total dissolution of Izar. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
16. (SBU) This is not how Zapatero, who is mindful of the 
last PSOE administration\'s strained ties to labor, wanted to 
initiate his relationship with Spanish unions.  His offer and 
subsequent retraction of support for the workers was 
especially embarrassing.  However, Zapatero\'s administration, 
particularly Minister of the Economy Solbes, appears to have 
recovered from that gaffe and regained the initiative.  The 
ability of the GOS to extract a positive response from the EC 
(at least for the moment) took the punch out of opposition 
argument that the PSOE was acting on behalf of Brussels 
rather than Spanish workers.  Unfortunately for Zapatero, 
there is no solution that will both save all Izar jobs and 
satisfy the EC that the GOS has ceased its illegal subsidies. 
 Any viable solution is likely to incite another round of 
labor unrest.

TAGS: PTER, PREL, SP, Counterterrorism 
SUBJECT: SPAIN CELEBRATES ARREST OF ETA LEADERS 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick; reason 1.5 (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Spanish politicians, police officials, and 
the media rejoiced after learning of the capture of ETA 
leader Mikel Albizu Iriarte, his partner Soledad Iparragirre, 
and 19 other ETA members and supporters in southern France 
and northern Spain.  Police also seized hundreds of pounds of 
explosives, detonators, tens of thousands of rounds of 
ammunition, and dozens of automatic weapons.  Albizu (AKA 
\"Antza\") served as the head of ETA\'s political apparatus 
since the 1992 arrest of ETA\'s political cupula.  Iparragirre 
(AKA \"Anboto\"), who spent at least several months in 
\"retirement\" in Cuba in recent years, is wanted in connection 
with at least 14 killings in Spain.  GOS officials and 
opposition parties lauded the success of the four-year effort 
by the Guardia Civil, as well as the cooperation and 
efficiency of the French police in rounding up the suspects. 
The GOS will seek the extradition of Iparragirre on murder 
charges, but is evidently content to let Albizu be tried in 
France, despite calls from some in Spain to demand his 
extradition as well.  There is a palpable sense that, after 
decades of painstaking policework, the GOS may be near to 
eliminating ETA\'s terrorist threat.  Nevertheless, the GOS 
has struck an appropriately cautionary tone since dangerous 
ETA militants remain at large and will be tempted to stage 
retaliatory strikes against the GOS.  End Summary. 
 
//A \"HISTORIC\" BLOW TO ETA// 
 
2. (U) Interior Minister Jose Antonio Alonso announced on 
10/3 that French and Spanish police had scored a \"historic\" 
blow against ETA after a four-year Guardia Civil 
investigation culminated in the rounding up 20 suspects in 
southern France and 1 in the northern Spanish city of Burgos. 
 The detainees include Albizu, ETA\'s leader for at least the 
last 11 years, and his partner Iparragirre, one of ETA\'s most 
notorious killers.  Iparragirre was believed to be in charge 
of collecting \"revolutionary taxes\" through the extortion of 
businessmen in the Basque Region and is implicated in at 
least 14 killings.  The arrest of the couple was described as 
an unexpected bonus for the police, since they only rarely 
occupied the French farmhouse where they were arrested.  Also 
present at the farmhouse was their small child, who was born 
in Cuba when Iparragirre \"retired\" there for several months 
or years in the late 1990s.  The only arrest in Spain was 
that of Pedro Alcantarilla Mozota, a truck driver accused of 
organizing recent bomb attacks on high-tension power lines in 
the Basque Region. 
 
3. (U) Spanish political observers described the arrests as 
the most damaging to ETA since the 1992 detentions of ETA\'s 
three political, military, and logistical leaders in Bidart, 
France.  The 10/3 arrests are the most significant in a 
series of arrests and investigations over the last two years 
that appear to have seriously disrupted ETA\'s capacity to 
carry out terrorist attacks.  They come just two weeks after 
ETA released a video reaffirming the primacy of the armed 
struggle in ETA\'s ideology and the group\'s intention to 
continue carrying out attacks.  Interior Minister Alonso 
declared that ETA has been \"debilitated\" and has \"no 
political future.\" 
 
//OPPOSITION HAILS ARRESTS// 
 
4. (SBU) The arrests came as the now-in-opposition Popular 
Party (PP) was wrapping up its 15th Party Congress, an event 
dominated by discussion of how the March 11 terrorist attacks 
on Spanish commuter trains had been the decisive factor in 
the Socialist (PSOE) victory over the PP.  Even as the PP 
leaders defended their record and attacked the PSOE\'s 
\"opportunism\" in using the train bombings to tilt the vote 
against the PP, speaker after speaker congratulated the GOS 
on the 10/3 arrests.  Newly-installed PP President Mariano 
Rajoy reaffirmed the value of the PP\'s pact with the PSOE to 
present a united front against terrorism.  All political 
parties also praised the GOS and the Guardia Civil. 
Meanwhile, the ETA front group Batasuna, which the USG and 
Spain have declared a terrorist group, remained silent on the 
police operation. 
 
5. (C) The only discordant note concerns the GOS\'s apparent 
decision not to seek the extradition of Albizu, who would 
face terrorism charges but not murder charges in Spain 
because he has not been directly implicated in ETA attacks. 
PP leader Rajoy insisted that the GOS seek the extradition of 
Albizu anyway, claiming he is ultimately responsible for the 
119 killings attributed to ETA under Albizu\'s leadership. 
High-profile judge (and sometime loose cannon) Baltazar 
Garzon has also indicated his interest in interviewing 
Albizu, and perhaps ultimately in his extradition. 
 
//POLITICAL RIPPLES IN BASQUE REGION// 
 
6. (C) The apparent \"decapitation\" of ETA may affect the 
political dynamic in the Basque Region in the runup to an 
important December vote in the Basque Parliament and regional 
elections in May 2005.  The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), 
the most important Basque nationalist grouping and a 
long-standing opponent of ETA, is heading towards a showdown 
with the GOS over its desire to hold a referendum on 
self-determination in the Basque territory (\"Plan 
Ibarretxe\").  The PNV plan comes to a vote in the Basque 
Parliament in December, at which point it may be defeated by 
PP and PSOE representatives.  If the plan is defeated in the 
Basque Parliament, the PNV will use Plan Ibarretxe as its 
party platform in the May elections, which would likely lead 
to a PNV victory.  The PNV has sworn not to proceed with any 
referendum in a climate of ETA violence.  The 10/3 arrests 
reduce ETA\'s capability to wage such a campaign and, 
paradoxically, increase the likelihood of a subsequent 
political confrontation between the Basque government and the 
central government. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
7. (C) The arrest of Albizu and the other ETA members 
represents the greatest blow to ETA in 12 years and a major 
setback in its ability to threaten the GOS with terrorist 
violence.  However, GOS officials are wise to caution against 
overly optimistic assessments of the impact of the police 
sweep.  Even before the 10/3 arrests, ETA was in crisis due 
to earlier GOS police successes and the capture of key ETA 
documents by police in recent months.  Despite its weakness, 
ETA managed to carry out a small, but very public, bombing 
campaign in Spanish tourist centers throughout the summer of 
2004.  In addition, police have yet to corral other important 
ETA militants, such as Josu Ternero, a particularly violent 
ETA member who was spotted with Albizu in the months prior to 
the 10/3 arrests.  There is a high likelihood that ETA 
remnants will seek to prove their continued viability as a 
terror organization, so dangerous ETA attacks remain a 
possibility, even if the 10/3 attacks truly mark the 
beginning of the end of the ETA threat.

-------------------------------------------- 
A.  PRESTIGE OIL SPILL CLEAN UP WINDING DOWN 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  Vice President Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega 
announced that the extraction of the last remaining amounts 
of oil from the \"Prestige,\" which sank off the Galician coast 
in November 2002 with 13,000 tons of crude oil aboard, was 
\"practically completed.\"  As a result, de la Vega said the 
government would soon abolish the \"Prestige Commission 
Office,\" which had handled the cleanup, and would replace it 
with a much cheaper permanent \"Coordination Center.\"  The new 
center will direct a working group that will draft an 
\"Integral Contingency Plan\" which would be applied after any 
future similar disaster.  In July, the Government 
appropriated 249.5 million euros to pay for ongoing 
compensation claims related to the disaster.  The Government 
believes these funds should be sufficient to address the vast 
majority of outstanding compensation claims.  A cabinet 
document announcing the above measures acknowledged, however, 
that legal liability battles regarding the Prestige (e.g., a 
Spanish Government civil suit against ABS, the company that 
had certified the Prestige\'s seaworthiness) continue to rage 
in New York. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
B.  REGULATORY REGIME CONCERNING OIL SPILL LIABILITIES 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4.  The Spanish cabinet announced September 10 that several 
separate government regulations touching upon liability 
issues related to civil responsibility for damages caused by 
maritime oil spills would be unified under one Royal Decree 
Law.  These regulations, which date from the 1970s through 
the 1990s, were generally adopted to bring international 
instruments into force in Spain.  Spain presumably decided, 
in the aftermath of the Prestige disaster, that its civil 
liability interests would be better protected if these 
disparate regulations were harmonized under the rubric of a 
Royal Decree Law. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
C.  SHIP BEARING SPANISH HAZARDOUS CARGO \"SINKS\" OFF TURKEY 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5.  In a story too long and tangled to fully relate here, on 
September 6, a Saint Vincent-flagged, Turkish-owned vessel 
carrying toxic materials from Asturias, Spain to a 
construction project in Algeria, sank off the coast of 
Turkey.  The cargo was 3,500 metric tons of Spanish origin 
chromium ash that had been purchased by the French firm 
Lafarge in 1999 to use in a construction project in Algeria. 
When the ship arrived off Algeria in 1999, the ash was found 
to have been contaminated by water and Lafarge refused to 
take delivery.  The Spanish supplier did not want the cargo 
back, saying it now belonged to Larfarge.  The vessel thus 
went to Turkey, where local authorities refused to let it 
unload the cargo pending legal resolution of the case.  Spain 
finally agreed in 2004 to take the cargo back, at least 
temporarily.  Three days before the ship was to depart for 
Spain, it sank, reportedly with only 2,200 metric tons of the 
ash on board.  Sabotage is strongly suspected and it is 
presumed that the remaining 1,300 metric tons of ash were 
dumped either on the way from Algeria to Turkey or somewhere 
near the vessel\'s temporary berth in Turkey.  Turkish 
authorities have reportedly prohibited fishing within 200 
meters of the site and claim that the cargo has not yet begun 
to leak.  Following an official request from the Turkish 
Government, Spain\'s Environment Ministry dispatched two 
technicians to Turkey to help with clean up efforts.   EU 
Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom announced that the 
EU would not have jurisdiction in the case because \"the 
contamination took place in a third (non EU) country.\" 
 
-------------------------------------- 
D.  CHEMICAL SPILL FOULS CATALAN RIVER 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6.  A report prepared by Spain\'s National Science Research 
Council (CSIC) and the Autonomous University of Barcelona has 
accused the Spanish \"Erkimia\" chemical company of illegally 
dumping over 360,000 tons of toxic waste into the Ebro River. 
 The company denied the charge, noting that its discharges 
had been correctly treated in accordance with law.  The 
report said that an area of the Ebro equivalent to 10 city 
blocks had been fouled on its bottom and banks and that the 
waste was now also rising to the surface.  It also noted that 
as a result of Erkimia\'s discharges, the Flix reservoir had 
been contaminated with DDT, 18 tons of mercury, and 60 tons 
of other heavy metals.  The report said the waste was 
produced in the process of extracting phosphates from animal 
feeds imported from Morocco.  The Environment Ministry said 
clean up efforts would begin in 2005 and be finished by 2008. 
 The Environment Ministry also appeared to back Erkimia\'s 
claims that it had respected the law, noting that the crux of 
the problem was \"long-standing\" pollution levels rather than 
specific Erkimia actions.  The report accused the Catalan 
authorities of having been aware of the problem, without 
taking action, since 1996. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
E.  STATE-FUNDED ENVIRONMENTAL WATCHDOG GROUP TO BE FOUNDED 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
7.  Environment Minister Cristina Narbona announced in August 
that the Government would soon create an independent, but 
state-financed, environmental watchdog group charged with 
producing an annual report evaluating the efficacy of the 
Government\'s environmental policies.  The report would be 
released sometime in the first three months of each calendar 
year, with the first report expected by March of 2005.  The 
group would include private sector experts, NGO 
representatives, scientists, university representatives, 
businessmen, and members of local and regional governments. 
Most financing would come from the Government, but it is 
hoped that civil society will also help pay the group\'s 
operating costs.  One of Narbona\'s top advisors said they 
were inspired by the EU\'s \"spring report\" evaluating the 
efficacy of the EU\'s environmental policies. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
F.  MADRID\'S \"GREEN PATROL\" HUNTS ENVIRO-CRIMINALS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8.  The Environmental Protection Unit of Madrid\'s municipal 
police, otherwise known as \"the Green Patrol,\" reported that 
it filed charges in 110 cases during the course of 2003.  The 
unit, which has 89 members, noted that the total number of 
charges filed was lower than in previous years, attributing 
the reduction to greater public understanding of the need to 
protect the environment.  Combating noise pollution was one 
of the unit\'s greatest priorities.  The unit has installed 21 
decibel meters throughout the city and has trained 250 other 
officers in mediating noise-related disputes between 
neighbors.  It also stopped 1,254 persons in 2003 for driving 
vehicles whose noise levels exceeded the regulated norm. 
Most of these vehicles had had their mufflers illegally 
removed. 
 
------------------------ 
G.  WATER PRICES TO RISE 
------------------------ 
 
9. Environment Minister Cristina Narbona, hot on the heels of 
announcing the PSOE\'s new water management plan (Reftel), 
announced that the Spanish Government would gradually phase 
in a policy to have water prices reflect the cost of new (but 
not existing) water-related infrastructure.  The PSOE\'s water 
management plan, which emphasizes coastal desalinization 
plants over its predecessor\'s river diversion schemes, also 
puts greater emphasis on water conservation.  A gradual 
increase in water prices, in part to finance the new 
desalinization infrastructure (20 new plants and the 
modernization of many existing facilities), should help 
depress water demand, or at least lower its rate of increase. 
 By 2010, according to Narbona, water prices will reflect the 
full cost of new water-related infrastructure.  The 
opposition People\'s Party (PP) predictably attacked Narbona\'s 
announcement, noting that the PP\'s now defunct river 
diversion scheme included no provisions for increasing water 
prices.

SUBJECT: EMBASSY MADRID STRENGTHENS MUSLIM OUTREACH 
 
 
 1.  (U)  SUMMARY.  Embassy Madrid began its efforts for 
Muslim outreach in Spain by hosting the visit of Abdulwahab 
Alkebsi, Program Officer for the Middle East at the National 
Endowment for Democracy and the Department\'s first 
participant in the \"Citizen Diplomat\" program, September 29 - 
October 2.  Alkebsi met with Muslim associations, Spanish 
think tanks, members of the press, and government officials 
during his visit.  Embassy officials accompanied Alkebsi to 
an introductory meeting with Mercedes Rico Carabias, the 
Director General for Religious Affairs at the Ministry of 
Justice.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (U)  Alkebsi met with several prominent members of the 
Madrid Muslim community during his visit.  Poloff and members 
of the Public Affairs section accompanied Alkebsi to his 
meeting with Ebrahem Alzaid, the Director of the Islamic 
Cultural Center, on September 30.  Alzaid appreciated the 
contact with the Embassy and promised to keep the Embassy 
apprised of future Islamic cultural events in Madrid.  The 
Islamic Cultural Center also houses a mosque, informally 
dubbed the \"M30 Mosque\" due to its location along the M30 
highway.  The mosque is the largest mosque in Spain and its 
leaders play a strong role in influencing public attitudes 
towards Islam in Spain.  Alkebsi also met prominent members 
of Spanish Muslim associations; members of the Spanish press, 
including a sit-down interviews with El Mundo and TVE; a 
senior analyst on Arab issues at the Elcano Royal Institute, 
a Spanish think tank; and the president of Carta 
Mediterranea, an organization dedicated to reaching out and 
working with civil society in the Arab and Mediterranean 
Europe regions. 
 
3.  (U)  Embassy officials, including Charge, accompanied 
Alkebsi,to his meeting with Mercedes Rico Carabias, Director 
General for Religious Affairs at the Ministry of Justice. 
The introductory meeting was meant to inform the GOS that the 
USG would be creating a Muslim outreach program in Spain and 
that the visit of \"Citizen Diplomat\" Alkebsi was an example 
of the type of programs to expect.  Rico Carabias explained 
that a large part of her job is opening bridges to the Muslim 
community, particularly after the March 11 massacre in 
Madrid.  She stated that, although the Catholic church has 
traditionally received special considerations from the state, 
the government has tried to be more inclusive of other 
religions.  The GOS is trying to implement expanded public 
funding and tax benefits comparable to the advantages the 
Catholic church receives to members of the Protestant, 
Muslim, and Jewish communities.  She hopes that in the future 
Muslim communities in Spain will not have to rely entirely on 
foreign financing and that the GOS can make Muslims realize 
that they care what happens to their communities.  Rico 
Carabias also talked of the GOS extending suffrage in local 
elections to Spanish residents or EU residents; this would 
give many Muslim communities a larger voice in local politics 
as many Spanish Muslims are new arrivals who have not 
obtained Spanish nationality. 
 
4.  (U)  COMMENT.  Alkebsi\'s visit allowed the Embassy to 
have its first contact with several members of the local 
Muslim community, including the leaders of the \"M30 Mosque\". 
His status as a \"Citizen Diplomat\" not affiliated with the 
USG and his previous experience with political leaders and 
the press greatly assisted Embassy efforts to strengthen 
Muslim outreach efforts in Spain.

SUBJECT: SPAIN URGES FRANCE TO BUDGE ON WESTERN SAHARA 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathleen M. Fitzpatrick, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The Spanish Foreign Ministry\'s chief diplomat for 
Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and African issues told 
visiting EUR/WE office director Kathy Allegrone October 1 
that Spain has edged \"closer toward neutrality\" on the 
Western Sahara issue and is urging France to budge from its 
firm support for Morocco\'s position in the conflict.  Spain 
believes the UNSC must amend the Baker plan to allow for 
further negotiation since \"Morocco simply refuses to accept 
the Baker plan.\"  The MFA\'s desk officer for North Africa 
told poloff separately that although Spain wants SGSR de Soto 
to jump start negotiations, the Spanish are concerned the 
international community will ignore the issue because de Soto 
does not have James Baker\'s star power.  The Zapatero 
government is convinced any final resolution must recognize 
Moroccan sovereignty but also autonomy for the Sahrawis.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Western Sahara Process Off Course 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Alvaro Iranzo, the MFA\'s director general for the 
Mediterranean, Middle East and Africa told Allegrone and 
poloff that the Western Sahara matter was off course and the 
Zapatero government was trying to take corrective action. 
\"Any solution to the problem must be agreed, not imposed,\" 
commented Iranzo.  In order the prod the parties to move 
beyond the current impasse, the UN Security Council would 
need to pass a resolution that renews MINURSO and gives SGSR 
de Soto a mandate to negotiate changes to the Baker Plan.  In 
terms of a solution, Iranzo said \"No plan makes sense without 
some kind of autonomy for the Sahrawis, but at the same time 
the Moroccan flag must fly over the territory.\"  Separately, 
the MFA\'s North Africa desk officer told poloff that even 
though Spain would like de Soto to spur further negotiations, 
Spain is worried that without former Secretary Baker\'s star 
power, the international community will ignore the problem 
and the dispute will simmer indefinitely. 
 
--------------------------------- 
France Should Follow Spain\'s Lead 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) After first denying Spain had shifted its 
long-standing support for the Polisario, Iranzo later 
admitted Spain had modified its position \"slightly\" in the 
hopes that France would do the same.  The first order of 
business is to achieve some degree of \"rapprochement\" between 
Algeria and Morocco,\" and that would only happen if France 
does as Spain has done -- move somewhat toward neutrality. 
France has always backed Morocco fully but \"Paris needs to be 
more flexible.8  Iranzo did not predict how likely France 
was to budge from its support for Morocco but assured us the 
Zapatero government was working hard to make this happen. 
\"Spain has adopted a more pragmatic approach that does not 
antagonize any of the principal parties to the dispute.  We 
are hoping France does the same,\" explained Iranzo.  The 
MFA\'s North Africa desk officer commented separately to 
poloff that the long-running dispute in Western Sahara is the 
major obstacle to good Algerian-Moroccan relations and is 
therefore a matter of abiding interest to the both France and 
Spain.  Iranzo said that once France has revised its 
position, Madrid would be looking to Washington for further 
support in resolving the conflict. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
You Can Bring the Horse to Water . . . 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) In the end, however, Iranzo admitted the serious 
challenge facing Spain, France and others seeking a solution. 
 The Polisario insists the Baker Plan be implemented but 
Morocco refuses to do so.  \"You can bring the horse to the 
water, but you can\'t make it drink,\" Iranzo said, \"it appears 
that right now neither horse wants to drink and ultimately 
they must do so voluntarily.\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (C) Iranzo\'s remarks are consistent with FM Moratinos\' 
statements several days before to the Spanish Senate that the 
Baker Plan was a dead end because Morocco would not accept 
it.  But Iranzo was more forthcoming than Moratinos has been 
on Spain\'s new \"realpolitik\" approach to the conflict -- 
Moratinos has not yet admitted Spain has altered its support 
for the Polisario.  Spain\'s new, more pragmatic approach 
toward Moroccan interests makes sense only if Madrid succeeds 
in getting Paris to be equally pragmatic about Algeria\'s and 
the Polisario\'s interests.  Despite the Zapatero government\'s 
well-known reorientation of Spain\'s foreign policy toward 
France, it remains to be seen whether Spain can exercise any 
influence over its northern neighbor on an issue of 
significance, such as Western Sahara.

A.  POLICY CHANGE ON EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3.  The Health Ministry announced that in October, the 
Spanish cabinet would issue a Royal Decree Law that would 
permit embryonic stem cell research in Spain.  The new law 
will reportedly allow research only on embryos that were 
stored in \"In Vitro\" fertility centers prior to November, 
2003 (in keeping with the terms of Spain\'s November 2003 
Assisted Reproduction Law).  The new law will reportedly 
regulate the conduct of embryonic stem cell research and how 
donor consent must be obtained.  The Royal Decree Law will be 
an interim measure until the overarching Assisted 
Reproduction Law of November 2003 can be amended to permit 
such research, including on embryos placed into storage after 
November, 2003. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
B.  GOVERNMENT PLANS 25 PERCENT INCREASE IN R AND D BUDGET 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
4.  Hoping to keep his campaign promise, President Zapatero 
announced that his 2005 national budget proposal would 
include a 25 percent increase in R and D funding.  Justifying 
his request, Zapatero said the increased funding would 
\"permit policies that attract Spanish as well as foreign 
researchers who are working in other countries.  It will 
especially boost research in sectors key to improving 
(Spain\'s) competitiveness:  pharmaceuticals, space, 
telecommunications, biotechnology, clean energy technologies 
and sustainable development.\"  In 2002, Spain officially 
spent 0.97 percent of its GNP on R and D.  The EU average is 
reportedly close to 2.0 percent of GDP. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
C.  SPAIN\'S LARGEST PRIVATE MEDICAL RESEARCH FACILITY OPENS 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5.  Spain\'s largest private medical research center opened 
September 20 at the University of Navarra.  The Research 
Center for Applied Medicine (CIMA) will focus its research 
on:  neurology, in particular Parkinson\'s and Alzheimer\'s 
diseases; cardiovascular diseases; oncology; gene therapy; 
and, hepatology.  Over 300 scientists will work on 22 
official projects in the above areas.  70 percent of the 
center\'s 33 million euro start up costs were financed by the 
private sector.  A consortium of 15 corporations has promised 
to pay over 75 percent of the center\'s estimated 200 million 
euro operating costs for the 2004-14 period.  The balance of 
the financing will come from research grants (both public and 
private) as well as other forms of public funding.  The 
center\'s director, Francisco Errasti, said he hoped that many 
Spanish scientists working abroad would come back to Spain to 
work at the center.  The head of the center\'s gene therapy 
department, Jesus Prieto, ruled out any research with 
embryonic stem cells, saying his team would use only adult 
stem cells. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
D.  INTER-MINISTERIAL SCIENCE COMMISSION ALTERED 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6.  The Government\'s Inter-Ministerial Science Research and 
Development and Technological Innovation Commission, which 
was established on May 14 by the then just-elected PSOE 
government, was scrapped in September before even meeting for 
the first time.  The September 3 Royal Decree Law abolishing 
the still-born Commission noted that it would have been 
redundant with the extant Inter-Ministerial Science and 
Technology Commission (CICYT).  The CICYT is charged with 
inter-agency coordination of science and technology-related 
issues that cut across ministerial lines.  The Royal Decree 
Law of September 3 also assigned operational control of the 
CICYT to the newly established Ministry of Education and 
Science and Technology.

TAGS: PGOV, SP, Popular Party 
SUBJECT: AZNAR DOMINATES POPULAR PARTY CONGRESS 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick; reason 1.5 (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Mariano Rajoy, a long-time Aznar ally and 
the Popular Party\'s presidential candidate in the March 14 
elections, was elected as the new President of the Popular 
Party (PP) during the 15th PP Party Congress.  The event was 
dominated by enthusiastic expressions of support for former 
President Jose Maria Aznar and attacks on the \"inconsistency\" 
of the ruling Socialist administration.  Madrid Mayor 
Gallardon, the PP\'s most visible advocate of a tilt towards 
the political center and the most popular PP politician among 
the general electorate, stated flatly that the PP \"must have 
done something wrong\" to lose the March 14 elections.  Rajoy 
was more cautious, saying the PP would \"look to the future, 
not the past\" and would seek \"greater dialogue\" with the 
electorate.  Both Gallardon and Rajoy were overshadowed by 
Aznar, who, in a fiery speech near the close of the Congress, 
proclaimed that he had no regrets regarding the actions of 
his administration and called on the PP to remain true to its 
fundamental principles.  The election of Angel Acebes - the 
public face of the Aznar administration\'s controversial 
handling of the March 11 terrorist attacks - as PP Secretary 
General indicates that there will be no revamping of the PP 
leadership in order to erase voter memories of that episode. 
Aznar moved into the largely ceremonial role of Honorary PP 
President, but his powerful appeal to the PP base will 
complicate both Rajoy\'s gentle shift towards the center and 
Gallardon\'s more ambitious aspirations.  End Summary. 
 
//PP CHANGES ITS COLORS, BUT NOT ITS MESSAGE// 
 
2. (C) Poloff joined other diplomats in attending the 10/3 
closing ceremony of the 15th PP Party Congress.  The most 
tangible sign of change in the party was the adoption of new 
colors, dropping its staid, conservative blue banners in 
favor of a brilliant orange.  Color changes aside, most 
political analysts predicted the Congress would feature a 
showdown between advocates of moving the PP towards the 
political center and party stalwarts who oppose any watering 
down of traditional PP principles, such as the party plank 
affirming Christianity as a guiding element.  In the end, 
however, there was only a cautious airing of differences, as 
most speakers lambasted the ruling Socialist (PSOE) 
government and reaffirmed their support for traditional PP 
positions.  Key indicators of continuity included the 
selection of Angel Acebes as PP Secretary General -- despite 
his unpopular role as Minister of the Interior at the time of 
the 3/11 train bombings -- and the reelection of most members 
of the PP\'s National Executive Committee. 
 
//CALLS FOR INTROSPECTION AND CHANGE// 
 
3. (C) Charismatic Madrid Mayor Alberto Ruiz Gallardon, who 
is very popular with non-PP voters but is distrusted by the 
more conservative PP rank-and-file, broke the trend and made 
veiled criticisms of the Aznar administration during his 
speech.  (Gallardon was seated with second-tier PP leaders 
and spoke on the second day of the convention rather than in 
the all-important closing ceremony on day three.)  Gallardon 
praised the successes of the Aznar years, but said the PP 
should recognize that it \"must have done something wrong\" to 
lose the March 14 elections.  He suggested the PP should 
review its positions on social issues, such as the inclusion 
of Christianity in the PP platform and the party\'s opposition 
to adoptions by homosexual couples, to determine whether such 
positions alienated potential supporters.  PSOE, bucking the 
Spanish Catholic Church, favors legalizing homosexual 
marriage and giving homosexual couples adoption rights, moves 
apparently popular with the Spanish public.  Gallardon said 
that in the future the PP would have to adjust to new social 
realities and \"increase its presence in the streets.\"  The 
crowd applauded politely, but Gallardon\'s comments received 
no more than a tepid response. 
 
//AZNAR EXPRESSES NO REGRETS: \"WE\'RE RIGHT AND PSOE IS 
WRONG\"// 
 
4. (SBU) Aznar, by contrast, was greeted as a conquering hero 
by the enthusiastic crowd and was introduced as the \"moral 
point of reference\" of the PP.  Prior to his entry, a video 
reviewed the highlights of the Aznar era and his stewardship 
of the party during its most successful period.  Relaxed and 
confident, Aznar began by congratulating the Spanish security 
forces for the landmark capture of ETA leaders earlier in the 
day in a joint operation with the French government.  He 
recounted the many PP victims of ETA terrorism (the crowd 
roared with approval during a video clip of Aznar walking 
away from a failed ETA assasination attempt) and said the GOS 
\"can never stop fighting terrorism.\" 
 
5. (SBU) After announcing his unequivocal support for Rajoy, 
Aznar recited the achievements of his administration and 
launched broadside after broadside at his PSOE critics.  He 
said the PP should not fear being in opposition to Zapatero, 
alone if necessary, as long as the party remained \"coherent 
and consistent.\"  Aznar insisted that the PP\'s primary 
responsibility was to the 10 million voters who had backed 
the party in its worst moments because the PP was the only 
party that reflected their convictions.  The PP left Spain 
\"solvent, without a deficit, and with fewer terrorists on the 
streets and none in the institutions of government\" (an 
allusion to PSOE involvement in a dirty war against ETA 
during the Felipe Gonzalez era.) 
 
6. (SBU) In another swipe at alleged PSOE corruption under 
Gonzalez, Aznar said his administration would be remembered 
as \"the government that didn\'t steal.\"  He echoed earlier PP 
speakers in claiming that President Zapatero\'s sole agenda 
thus far was to roll back PP measures and irresponsibly 
increase spending.  Aznar noted that, unlike Zapatero, he 
didn\'t \"settle scores\" with PSOE when he took office in 1996, 
\"even though there were many opportunities to do so.\"  He 
contrasted Zapatero\'s pursuit of \"false\" social gains with 
the \"genuine\" economic improvements brought about during his 
administration.  Aznar accused Zapatero of reopening old 
wounds, especially by renewing discussion of constitutional 
reforms, opening the possibility of greater devolution of 
power to the regions (anathema to the PP).  Closing to 
rousing applause, Aznar said the PP had a \"patriotic 
responsibility\" to oppose PSOE\'s policies.  \"We are right and 
PSOE is demonstrating that it is wrong...We should never be 
ashamed of the way we governed or we will never be capable of 
returning to government.\" 
 
//RAJOY STEERS A MIDDLE COURSE// 
 
7. (SBU) After a rather less stirring video on Rajoy\'s 
political history, the new PP President took the stand to 
reel the crowd back in and focus on his project for the 
furture of the party.  He began by going over the fundamental 
planks of the party platform, which he said underpinned the 
PP\'s vision of a Spain that is \"solvent, free, and unified.\" 
Though it took some time to capture the enthusiasm of the 
attendees, Rajoy pulled them in with a humorous review of the 
early missteps of the Zapatero administration.  He criticized 
Socialist \"sectarianism\" and Zapatero\'s reliance on regional 
leaders intent on gaining greater powers from Madrid.  Rajoy 
agreed that the PP had a proud record, but said he would not 
dwell on the past and would instead focus on the future, 
including a commitment to the political center.  He extended 
an olive branch to PSOE on foreign policy, saying that, like 
terrorism, the two parties should agree on core strategic 
interests so that Spain would be seen as a \"serious country\" 
by the international community rather than veering from 
alliance to alliance depending on which party was in power. 
A PSOE representative expressed interest in the offer on 
10/4. 
 
//TERRORISM A CENTRAL THEME// 
 
8. (SBU) The PP\'s fight against terrorism was a core issue 
throughout the convention, especially during Aznar\'s speech. 
\"We did the right thing when we decided to jump in up to our 
necks in the fight against terrorism alongside our friends 
and allies,\" proclaimed Aznar.  Aznar scorned an editorial 
writer who recently compared him to Osama bin Laden, saying 
he was untroubled by that comparison, nor by the accusation 
by another writer that he bore responsibility for the 200 
deaths in the March 11 train bombings.  \"That man should ask 
himself how many bodies his friends (PSOE) are responsible 
for,\" again alluding to PSOE\'s involvement in the 
extrajudicial killings of ETA activists during the Gonzalez 
administration.  \"We can say with our heads held high that 
our hands our clean and that we never had to bury any 
cadavers in quicklime during our time in power.\"  Aznar said 
the right way to deal with terrorists was to attack them 
directly through legal means. 
 
9. (SBU) Rajoy also attacked PSOE\'s \"manipulation\" of the 
3/11 train bombings, but emphasized the importance of the 
PP-PSOE joint position against terrorism and called on other 
parties to join the pact \"without attempting to weaken it.\" 
He congratulated Minister Interior Alonso for the major ETA 
arrests and expressed his continued willingness to work with 
all parties against threats to national security. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
10. (C) Rajoy may have been the official winner of the PP 
Presidency, but the Congress was Aznar\'s show.  It is clear 
that Aznar continues to command the support of the PP 
rank-and-file and that Rajoy will have to step gingerly if he 
is to successfully move the party towards the political 
center.  For now, Rajoy is focused on honing the PP\'s message 
as the main opposition party and consolidating his personal 
leadership of the party machinery.  Meanwhile, Gallardon, for 
all his popularity among non-PP voters and attractiveness as 
a candidate, remains on the margins of party leadership.  He 
has not convinced PP loyalists that regaining power is worth 
compromising ideological positions that many view as the core 
strength of the party.  The PP Party Congress did not 
strengthen Gallardon\'s position.

nd (D). 
 
1. (C) Poloff contacted MFA Deputy Director General for 
Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Pedro Gomez de 
Olea on 10/7 to discuss reports that the Spanish Embassy in 
Havana was planning to break with EU policy by not inviting 
dissidents to its national day reception on 10/12.  Gomez de 
Olea, who had clearly anticipated poloff\'s call, said he had 
no information to provide because the decision on whether to 
invite dissidents would be made by Foreign Minister Moratinos 
himself.  He said that, to his knowledge, no final decision 
had been made. 
 
2. (C) Gomez de Olea (please protect) indicated a certain 
exasperation with the issue, saying it had been his 
understanding that the GOS would comply with EU policies 
calling for the inclusion of national day event, but that it 
now seemed FM Moratinos felt he had to make the decision 
himself.  Gomez de Olea said it was likely no decision would 
be made until right before the 10/12 event and that he would 
likely learn of it at the same time we did.  He added that it 
was well known that the GOS wanted to revisit EU measures 
against the GOC to find \"more effective\" tools, but his tone 
suggested frustration with the way in which the issue of 
invitations is being handled by FM Moratinos. 
 
3. (C) Poloff inquired about the accuracy of news reports 
that Cuban FM Perez Roque had told Moratinos in New York that 
noted political prisoner Raul Rivero would not be released if 
Spain invited dissidents to its national day event, comments 
which Popular Party politicians denounced as blackmail. 
Gomez de Olea scoffed, saying that Perez Roque had not made 
such a statement, but that in fact his comments were even 
\"more insulting\" than those reported.  He said Perez Roque 
demanded not only the lifting of EU measures undertaken in 
the wake of the 2003 GOC crackdown on dissident, but also the 
full revision of the EU Common Position to remove all 
European political conditions on improved ties with Cuba. 
 
//CUBAN ANTI-EMBARGO RESOLUTION// 
 
4. (C) Poloff took advantage of the conversation to review 
ref D points regarding the upcoming Cuba embargo resolution. 
Gomez de Olea said Spain would hew closely to past EU 
practice, including voting in favor of the Cuban resolution 
while criticizing GOC human rights practices in an 
Explanation of Vote.  This was GOS policy under the Aznar 
Government as well.  We will follow up by delivering ref D 
points to the MFA Office of UN Affairs. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
5. (C) Moratinos\' positions on Cuba continue to undermine the 
Zapatero Administration\'s contention that human rights will 
remain on the forefront of GOS policy towards Cuba.  Instead, 
Moratinos appears to favor \"dialogue at any cost\" with 
respect to Cuba and seems willing to risk the ire of both the 
EU and the USG in order to improve relations with the GOC. 
Even if Moratinos does opt to invite dissidents, this episode 
makes it abundantly clear that the GOS will continue to chip 
away at EU resolve to hold the GOC to at least minimal human 
rights standards.  Given Spanish public opposition to U.S. 
policy towards Cuba, the Zapatero Government could be tempted 
to portray any rapprochement with Havana as yet another 
demonstration of its \"independence\" f

1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Poloff discussed Iraq, China, Libya, 
Sudan, and North Cyprus with Enrique Mora Benavente, MFA Head 
of EU Planning, on October 6.  Mora Benavente does not expect 
that Iraq will be discussed at the GAERC meetings.  Spain\'s 
position on the China arms embargo remains unchanged; for 
example, a strengthened Code of Conduct would be sufficient 
to replace the embargo.  The decision has already been made 
to lift sanctions and the arms embargo against Libya; the EU 
is now working on an appropriate Code of Conduct for Libya. 
Spain supports EU efforts helping the African Union in Sudan 
and will contribute humanitarian assistance, although there 
will be no bilateral contribution to the African Union force. 
 Although, Spain supports increased economic cooperation with 
North Cyprus, only the 259 million euro aid package is likely 
to pass, due to Greek and Greek Cypriot opposition.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
---- 
IRAQ 
---- 
 
2.  (C)  Mora Benavente said Iraq would not be discussed at 
the GAERC meetings. He said the GOS will not contribute as a 
member state to the UN Protection Force in Iraq.  (FYI: 
Spanish Defense Minister Bono had to retract a statement 
earlier this week indicating the GOS might send troops to 
Iraq under a UN request.)  He added that Spain is still 
exploring police training options with USD 300 million that 
it has pledged towards Iraq, but the situation on the ground 
does not allow for cooperation at this moment. 
 
-------------------- 
CHINA ARMS EMBARGO 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Spain believes that the Code of Conduct is 
sufficient to monitor arms sales to China.  EUR/WE Director 
Kathleen Allegrone, Charge, and Poloff discussed U.S. 
concerns about the EU lifting the Chinese arms embargo while 
highlighting human rights concerns in separate meetings with 
a variety of Spanish MFA officials September 28-30 (Ref B). 
Mora Benavente said that there would be a discussion on 
lifting the arms embargo during lunch on October 11, but no 
final decision would be made until later.  He added that 
eventually the arms embargo will be lifted as a political 
signal of EU efforts to foster better relations with China, 
but that the date could possibly be pushed back if that leads 
to increased cooperation with the U.S. and Japan on the issue. 
 
---------------- 
LIBYAN SANCTIONS 
---------------- 
 
4.  (C)  The EU has already decided to announce the full 
lifting of sanctions against Libya, including its arms 
embargo.  The partial lifting of the arms embargo to allow 
for border control equipment to stem the flow of illegal 
immigration will be the first step of the lifting of the 
embargo.  Once a Code of Conduct is agreed upon, the full 
lifting of sanctions and the arms embargo will take place. 
The EU believes that Libya has abandoned its pursuit of 
weapons of mass destruction and terrorist activities and is 
encouraged by Libya\'s agreement to settle with the EU victims 
of Lockerbie and LaBelle. (For more detail on GOS thinking on 
this issue, see Ref C.) 
 
----- 
SUDAN 
----- 
 
5.  (C)  The GOS supports EU efforts in coordinating with the 
Australians and the U.S. to encourage the African Union to 
focus on rapid deployment of forces to improve the security 
situation in Darfur.  Spain will be contributing humanitarian 
assistance to the victims in Darfur, but there will be no 
bilateral economic assistance outside of any EU efforts to 
the African Union force.  The GOS concurs with U.S. views on 
the dire situation in Darfur, but is waiting for the 
conclusions of the commission of inquiry set up by UNSCR 1564 
before deciding if the situation in Darfur should be called a 
genocide. 
 
------------ 
NORTH CYPRUS 
------------ 
 
6.  (C)  Spain is very supportive of extending trade 
concessions and financial assistance to the Turkish Cypriots, 
but at recent EU meetings both Greece and Cyprus had opposed 
increased EU economic ties with North Cyprus, a change 
requiring unanimous consent.  Mora Benavente said that the 
current EU goal is to extend economic assistance now and then 
push for trade considerations when the Greeks and Greek 
Cypriots are willing.  Spain will support the 259 million 
euro aid package to North Cyprus when it comes to a vote. 
Benavente predicts the EU will approve the aid package, 
because an aid package to North Cyprus does not require 
unanimous consent (Ref D).

1. (U) We delivered ref A points October 6 to Enrique Mora 
Benavente, MFA Head of EU Planning.  Mora Benavente assured 
us that Spain considers the Maoist rebels to be terrorists. 
He does not believe that other EU governments consider the 
Maoists freedom fighters.  Mora Benavente expects that Spain 
will support action against the Maoists at the next EU 
Clearinghouse meeting.  He promised to discuss the demarche 
points with his MFA colleagues covering terrorist issues. 
 
2.(C) Mora Benavente went on to criticize the EU 
Clearinghouse process.  In Mora Benavente\'s opinion, most 
delegates to the EU Clearinghouse meetings are professional 
diplomats and politicians rather than technical terrorism 
experts, and therefore only have knowledge of the most well 
known terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida or ETA.  When less 
well known terrorist groups are brought up for listing, EU 
Clearinghouse meetings become trading sessions, where another 
country will respond by attempting to get a completely 
unrelated group listed.

1.  (U) We delivered Reftel A demarche to Javier Hergueta 
Garnica, Deputy Director General of Bilateral International 
Economic Relations with Europe and the OECD, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, as well as Sr. Joan Trullen 
Tomas, Secretary General of Industry and Jesus Candil 
Gonzalo, Director General of Industrial Development, both of 
the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce. 
 
2.  (SBU) Only Hergueta has been available for comment.  He 
expressed dismay that the USG took the case to the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) rather than negotiating a new 
agreement.  He provided the anticipated argument that the USG 
subsidizes Boeing, and expressed hoped that the matter would 
quickly move back into negotiating a new agreement.  He 
alleged that failing to resolve this matter quickly is \"bad 
for both companies and countries.\" 
 
3.  (U) Spanish press generally covered the major arguments 
of both the US and the EU, with none advocating the USG 
position.  All included allegations that presidential 
election politics played a significant role in the timing of 
this dispute.  Following are some excerpts: 
 
-Conservative - ABC, circ. 359,738: 
...at the base of this discussion are two key factors:  the 
unstoppable increase in Airbus sales, and the upcoming US 
presidential election. 
 
-Left of center - El Pais, circ. 552,114: 
Brussels felt betrayed by being taken before the WTO while in 
the process of negotiating with Washington and following the 
last meeting on the 16th of September, which the Commission 
considered to be constructive. 
 
-Independent - El Mundo, circ. 408,471: 
Although Republican ideology defends the free market through 
to its ultimate consequences, the Bush administration has 
promoted a very protectionist policy in the last four years, 
in particular with steel, cotton and other agricultural 
products, along with importation penalties. 
 
3.  (SBU) Comment:  Beginning with our first consultation 
with Hergueta reported in Reftel B, it appeared that the GOS 
would play a fairly passive role in this matter.  Recent 
conversation with Hergueta does not modify this impression: 
the only difference being dismay that the dispute has moved 
to the WTO and the belief that utilizing the WTO will 
seriously harm commerce.

2.  (SBU) Moreno expressed doubt that this issue would gain

financial impact that this project could have on Spain,s 
dominant petroleum company and former government-owned 
monopoly.

SUBJECT: KYOTO NOW MATTERS TO SPAIN 
 
REF: A. MADRID 3273 
     B. MONTEVIDEO 1390 
 
1. (SBU) During an October 13 courtesy call by newly arrived 
ESTHOFF, Environment Ministry General Coordinator for Climate 
Change Teresa Rivera stressed that the Kyoto Protocol enjoyed 
the strong support of the entire cabinet of the \"new\" Spanish 
Government, and that Spain was determined to do its utmost to 
fulfill its CO2 emissions targets under the terms of the 
agreement.  Rivera (please protect) said that the previous 
center-right Aznar Government found Kyoto \"inopportune\" and 
had thus \"parked\" any serious effort to meet Spain\'s target 
of limiting CO2 emissions to 15 percent above 1990 levels. 
Instead, emissions were allowed to grow unchecked and have 
arrived to the level of 40 percent over 1990 levels.  By 
contrast, the \"new\" (elected this past March) center-left 
Zapatero Government views Kyoto compliance as one the 
principal planks of its \"return to Europe strategy.\"  (Note: 
During the election campaign, Zapatero consistently 
criticized Aznar\'s emphasis on strong ties with the U.S. and 
made several gestures toward France and Germany immediately 
after taking office.  End Note.) 
 
2.  (U) Rivera acknowledged that it would be \"very difficult\" 
for Spain to meet the 15 percent above 1990 levels target, 
but that Zapatero and the rest of his cabinet were determined 
to do the best they could to limit CO2 emissions.  The first 
part of the Government\'s compliance strategy was to complete 
its National Emissions Compliance Allocation Plan, as 
required by EU Directive 87/2003.  This was submitted to 
Brussels in September (Ref A).  The second step was to create 
a National Emissions Rights Register which allocates CO2 
emissions rights to the sectors of the economy covered by the 
EU Directive.  Requests for emissions rights were required by 
September 30 and the Environment Ministry is in the process 
of finalizing the register.  Both steps will allow Spain to 
participate in the EU\'s CO2 trading regime which will debut 
in January 2005. 
 
3.  (U) The harder part of the equation, according to Rivera, 
is not the bureaucratic framework but instead the 
industry/government reform and transformation required to 
actually reduce CO2 emissions.  The Government\'s strategy 
focuses on three areas:  (1) significantly reduce the amount 
of electricity generated by burning coal (replacing it with 
natural gas \"combined cycle\" generation); (2) reform tax 
policy to encourage greater energy efficiency; and, (3) use 
multiple tools available to government to greatly increase 
the percentage of energy generated by renewable energy 
sources.  Rivera stressed that all three areas required 
significant inter-ministerial coordination and that this was 
already under way.  She noted that Minister of Economy and 
Treasury Pedro Solbes, the holder of the Government\'s purse 
strings, was strongly behind the effort.  Rivera did stress, 
however, that Government\'s efforts could not succeed without 
the cooperation of Spain\'s autonomous regions and that 
efforts to get them on board were only now getting underway. 
 
4.  (U) Rivera said the goal of the above strategies was to 
reduce CO2 emissions from the current 40 percent over 1990 
levels to 24 percent over 1990 levels by 2012.  The remaining 
nine percent required to meet the 15 percent over 1990 target 
would be obtained via domestic carbon sink credits (two 
percent) and credits obtained on the international market 
(seven percent).  Rivera said Spain would not limit itself to 
credits obtained on the soon-to-be-born European CO2 credits 
market, but would also look further afield.  She said the 
September Spain-Uruguay greenhouse gas emissions reduction 
MOU (Ref B) would be replicated with other nations and would 
provide Spain with significant credits.  Rivera also noted 
that Russia\'s October decision to ratify Kyoto should serve 
to depress the price of emissions credits, thus facilitating 
Spain\'s efforts to acquire credits on global markets. 
 
5.  (U) Rivera stressed that Spain recognizes that any 
serious/successful effort to address the problem would 
require attention to the 60 percent of traditional Spanish 
C02 emissions not covered under the National Emissions 
Compliance Allocation Plan.  Her office was working on a new 
plan for these non-covered sectors as well.  She concluded by 
asserting that the many voices in the private sector had 
exaggerated the economic costs to Spain entailed by Kyoto 
Compliance.  Rather than focusing on purely business costs, 
the new government believes a serious effort to comply with 
Kyoto could actually help induce a \"technological revolution\" 
in Spain, particularly in electricity generation.  This could 
in turn have a long-term positive impact on the economy. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT:  Rivera, while quite friendly and open, is 
clearly a \"true believer\" in Kyoto.  We think she provided an 
accurate snapshot of Zapatero\'s intentions vis-a-vis Kyoto. 
But this government is young and inexperienced and still 
faces tough tradeoffs further down the road.  Opposition from 
within and outside the government will certainly grow once 
the economic costs of Kyoto compliance become more apparent. 
That said, we believe that Zapatero will endeavor to prevent 
Spain from continuing as an EU \"outlier\" with respect to 
Kyoto compliance.  He takes this \"return to Europe\" stuff 
seriously and likely believes that Kyoto is one litmus test 
of his Government\'s Europeaness (sic).

SUBJECT: ALLEGED MISDEEDS OF U.S. FLAGGED RESEARCH VESSEL 
 
Classified By: ECONCOUNS WHITNEY BAIRD PER 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1.  (C) The R/V Powell has been on U.S. Embassy Madrid\'s 
radar screen since September, when it first contacted us for 
assistance in processing a request to make a port call in a 
Spanish harbor.  Since our first contact with it, this vessel 
has demonstrated a consistent pattern of ignoring and at 
times trying to circumvent established U.S.-Spanish 
mechanisms for processing port call requests.  What had been 
a relatively minor issue (complicating U.S.-Spanish port 
visit cooperation), just ratcheted up a few notches with the 
publication of several articles the Spanish press over the 
weekend that alleged that the vessel, between its port calls 
in Spanish harbors, had been exploring for oil in Spanish 
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters under contract to the 
Moroccan Government. 
 
2.  (C) The press coverage to date appears to have been a mix 
of truth and speculation.  The truth part documents the 
vessel\'s past history of ignoring/circumventing Spanish port 
call procedures and the fact that it is currently illegally 
berthed in Las Palmas port (its last entry permit having 
expired on October 12).  The Embassy can verify some of these 
shenanigans.  It also appears to be true (published 
admissions by its owner/operator) that the vessel is under 
contract to the U.S. oil firm Kerr-McGee, who in cooperation 
with Shell, is exploring the area between the Canary Islands 
and the disputed Western Sahara territory for oil.  What is 
not clear to us is Kerr-McGee/Shell\'s contractual 
relationship with the Moroccan Government.  The Spanish press 
reports that Kerr-McGee has been under contact to the 
Moroccan Government since November 2001 to explore for oil in 
this area.  It also reports that a Moroccan official was 
aboard the Powell while it was conducting its activities. 
 
3. (U) What appears to be speculation, at least for now, is 
the allegation that the vessel has been taking samples in 
Spanish EEZ waters.  Press reporting of Spanish port/military 
officials quote officials indicating that the vessel has had 
administrative problems relating to its port visit requests. 
The press line stating that the vessel may have been 
exploring for oil in Spanish EEZ waters comes only from 
\"unnamed\" military sources.  Officials associated with TDI 
Brooks, the owners of the vessel, are quoted in the press 
asserting that their oil exploration activities were limited 
to Moroccan waters.  And remember that there is nothing in 
customary international law to stop the Powell from sailing 
in Spanish EEZ waters.  If there is something to the 
speculation, it may come down to whether the Powell actually 
took samples in EEZ waters claimed by Spain. 
 
4. (C) Part of the problem has been some confusion on all 
sides (including the USG) regarding whether the Powell needed 
a formal clearance to enter Spanish ports.  The U.S. has 
claimed it did not given its commercial vice scientific 
mission.  The Spanish authorities, who own the ports in 
question and thus hold all the cards, have consistently said 
the Powell does require such permits, given its 
classification as a research vessel.  In other words, the 
vessel\'s classification and not its mission is the key point 
for Spain.  In the end, the U.S. side acquiesced and on 
several occasions the Embassy interceded with Spanish 
authorities to get the Powell the port calls it desired. 
Notwithstanding the above, it has become readily clear to 
both the Spanish and Embassy authorities involved that the 
Powell has consistently played \"fast and loose\" in trying to 
get itself into port. 
 
5. (C) The story has not yet grown beyond the Canary Island 
and Madrid economic press (\"Expansion\" article of October 16 
- informal embassy translation emailed/faxed to OES/OA - Liz 
Tirpak and EUR/WE - Morgan Hall).  Nonetheless, given the 
recent tensions in the U.S.-Spanish bilateral relationship, 
we could easily see this story gaining traction and turning 
into a \"U.S. Government helping Morocco poach Spanish oil\" 
type of story line.  However it goes, we will be happy to see 
the stern of the Powell, whose representatives have been less 
than friendly in their interactions with Embassy officials 
and who have shown a unique ability to generate controversy 
wherever they sail.

intention to snub the King or the Spanish people, and had in 
fact spoken with the King who was understanding of the 
Ambassador\'s difficulty in attending the reception as well as 
the Ambassador\'s prior decision, known to the GOS, not to 
attend the National Day parade. Manzanares told Leon that 
comments from senior government officials that put the issue 
in the most negative light possible were very unhelpful, and 
reached Washington just as fast as they reached the press in 
Madrid.  Manzanares said the perception both in Madrid and 
Washington is that the current government exhibits very 
strong anti-Americanism, though we do not think that it is 
the intent of the government to portray itself in this way. 
 
3.  (C)  Leon said that there exists in Spain not so much 
anti-Americanism per se, but a broad anti-Bush administration 
sentiment, focused not on personalities but on policy. 
Manzanares asked Leon how the Zapatero government planned to 
put itself right with either a new Bush administration or a 
Kerry administration, noting that democracies need to come to 
terms with one another no matter which government was in 
power. 
 
U.S. Policies Post-Election 
 
 
4.  (C)  Manzanares noted that even if another party wins the 
U.S. election, most of our foreign policy challenges - Iraq, 
Iran, counter-terrorism, etc. will remain the same, so that 
the Spanish government needs to come to terms with this and 
find ways to put the relationship back on track.  Leon said 
that the U.S. should look at Spain\'s actions more than recent 
words.  For example, Leon said that Spain sent over 1000 
troops to Afghanistan -- a large deployment for Spain -- as a 
sign of goodwill toward the U.S.  Manzanares replied that we 
very much appreciated Spain\'s participation in Afghanistan, 
but there need to be more signals.  Leon promised there would 
be other such signs.  Manzanares noted that the U.S. was not 
concerned about Spain\'s desire to move toward what Spain saw 
as the \"heart of Europe.\"  The U.S. believes Europeans can 
remain close to the U.S. as well as their European 
counterparts. 
 
Leon Offers to Publicly Stress U.S.-Spain Cooperation 
 
 
5.  (C)  What we object to, Manzanares continued, is being 
the \"political football\" Spain uses as it seeks to reinforce 
its European policy.  \"Anti-Americanism is not a foreign 
policy, \" Manzanares said.  Leon agreed, and asked if it 
would be helpful if he would draft a public statement (or 
op/ed) highlighting the importance of U.S.-Spanish 
cooperation.  Manzanares said that would be very helpful and 
would welcome the idea of such a piece by the Spanish 
government. 
 
U.S. Has Been Patient 
 
 
6.  (C)  Reviewing relations since the March 14 elections, 
Manzanares underscored that the US had been very patient and 
mature these last few months.  The U.S. has refrained from 
responding to aggressive anti-US rhetoric as we looked for 
the new government to settle in, become more experienced and 
as we ourselves focused on our longer-term interests in 
Spain.  Continued anti-U.S. rhetoric from high GOS levels, 
however, was forcing us to reconsider this restraint and 
respond more aggressively.  Leon said he understood and hoped 
that this would not be necessary.  Returning to the theme of 
Zapatero\'s comments, such as those in Tunis several weeks 
ago, Manzanares asked Leon why Zapatero had not taken the 
opportunity to retract his statements after Secretary Powell 
had spoken to FM Moratinos.  Leon said that Zapatero had not 
intended the remarks the way they were taken and pointed to 
comments Zapatero had made in Bilbao the following day as 
being pro-American.  Manzanares pointed out that we had not 
seen these comments in Bilbao and they were not highlighted 
in the press here. 
 
Other issues: 
 
 
6.  (C)  Cuba:  Leon said the GOS did not want a wholesale 
change in the EU policy toward Cuba, but rather to modify it 
somewhat to allow EU Ambassadors and diplomats access to 
Castro and other Cuban officials in order to press home the 
need for reform.  Leon underscored there were no personal 
relations with Castro among members of the Socialist 
government in the way that existed during the previous 
Socialist government under Felipe Gonzalez.  Leon said if the 
other Europeans did not agree with Spain on the Cuba issue, 
Spain would not adopt a unilateral policy. 
 
7.  (C)  Western Sahara:  Leon noted the excellent meeting he 
had had with A/S Burns several weeks ago in which they 
discussed Western Sahara.  He said that Spanish and U.S. 
positions were relatively the same, and pointed to the French 
position -- embodied by Chirac himself -- as being the 
problem in finding a way forward.  Leon characterized 
Chirac\'s position in support of Rabat as \"stronger than that 
of the King of Morocco.\"  He pledged to continue to work with 
the USG on the issue.

1. (C) Summary.  Spanish National Police arrested eight 
Maghrebi residents of Spain on charges of planning to bomb 
Spain\'s High Court, which takes the lead in GOS terrorism 
investigations.  The detentions were based in part on USG 
information provided through Legatt channels.  According to 
news reports, the eight men were in the early stages of 
organizing a conspiracy that included plans to purchase 1,000 
kilos of dynamite with the aid of an imprisoned ETA bomber, 
and, police fear, plans for a number of suicide bombings.  A 
ninth suspect, reportedly the ringleader of the group, was 
arrested in Switzerland approximately one month ago.  The 
arrests were ordered by high-profile judge Baltazar Garzon, 
who is currently also prosecuting suspected al-Qa\'ida 
members.  Police have not established any connection between 
the 10/18 and the 3/11 train bombers.  Spanish National 
Police requested the assistance of Legatt Madrid and other 
foreign police agencies in the course of their investigation. 
 No explosives or weapons have been discovered as yet and it 
is not clear whether the authorities have sufficient evidence 
to secure a conviction or whether they acted now to disrupt 
the extremists out of concern that they would act before the 
GOS could obtain stronger evidence for legal purposes.  End 
Summary. 
 
//EIGHT MAGHREBI DETAINEES// 
 
2. (U) On the evening of 10/18 and early morning of 10/19, 
Spanish National Police arrested eight suspected Islamist 
militants, including four in Almeria: Ismail Latrech 
(Algerian), Mourad Yala (AKA \"Abu Anas\")(Algerian), an 
illegal immigrant Algerian known as \"Mehdi,\" and Magid 
Mchmacha (Moroccan).  Also arrested were: Ali Omar (AKA 
\"Jelloul\")(nationality uncertain) in Valencia, Djamel Merabet 
(Algerian) in Malaga, and Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed (from the 
Spanish enclave of Ceuta) in Madrid.  An eighth suspect was 
subsequently arrested in Pamplona and a ninth, reported to be 
the leader of the cell -- whose name has not yet been 
released -- has been in detention in Switzerland for the last 
month.  One suspect, Latrech, was previously known to the 
authorities as a drug informant for the National Intelligence 
Center (CNI), the main Spanish intelligence service, while 
several of the others had served prison sentences for a 
variety of crimes.  There are no indications thus far of a 
connection between the 10/18 detainees and the group that 
carried out the 3/11 train bombing. 
 
3. (U) According to press reports citing police sources, much 
of the information leading to the arrests was provided by an 
imam who is a double-agent for the Moroccan intelligence 
service and who has reported reliably in the past, including 
on the perpetrators of the March 11 train bombings in Madrid. 
 The information provided by this source led judicial 
officials to order wiretaps on the phones of the suspects, 
which allowed police to detect early planning for a terrorist 
operation.  After four months of collecting information, 
police carried out the coordinated arrests of the nine 
suspects.  During the detentions, police located a manual for 
carrying out \"martyrdom operations\" and other documentation 
related to the activities of the group. 
 
//PLANNING FOR \"MAJOR ATTACKS\" - AN ETA CONNECTION// 
 
4. (C) Police sources tell the press that the nine men were 
seeking 1,000 kilograms of dynamite with which to carry out a 
truck bomb attack against the High Court, the judicial body 
that leads GOS counterterrorism prosecutions, and other 
unspecified attacks.  Police indicated to Legatt considerable 
concern that the group would carry out suicide attacks with a 
portion of the explosives.  Apparently, these fears are based 
in part on information developed through wiretaps indicating 
that the nine suspects were attempting to identify Muslim 
common prisoners who might be willing to undertake \"martyrdom 
attacks.\"  The discovery of the manual on suicide attacks 
also seems to justify such concerns. 
 
5. (U) Of particular note is the alleged effort on the part 
of the Maghrebi group to obtain the dynamite through 
convicted ETA terrorist Juan Jose Rego Vidal, who is in 
prison for a 1995 attempt to assasinate King Juan Carlos. 
According to press reports, the nine suspects knew Rego and 
other ETA members from spending time in prison on 
non-terrorist charges.  The Maghrebis hoped Rego could either 
provide a direct source for the dynamite or could direct them 
to another person who could help them. 
//THE U.S. CONNECTION// 
 
6. (C) In the weeks leading up to the arrests, Spanish 
National Police requested the assistance of Legatt Madrid 
with respect to correspondence between the suspects in Spain 
and Muslim extremists in U.S. prisons.  The GOS evidently 
requested similar assistance from authorities in Australia 
and other countries.  Legatt coordinated U.S. assistance and 
was able to provide information useful to the Spanish 
investigators (sensitive law enforcement information reported 
via Legatt channels).  However, the information developed by 
Legatt does not appear related to the operational planning 
aspects of the Spanish cell, nor does it point to activities 
by the cell in the U.S. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
7. (C) These arrests have the makings of a significant 
counterterrorism success for both the GOS and Judge Garzon. 
(NOTE: Garzon has been handling the case of suspected 
al-Qa\'ida financier and cell leader Barakat Yarkas, arrested 
in Spain in November 2001, while another judge, Juan del 
Olmo, has led the 3/11 investigation.  END NOTE.)  GOS 
security agencies have been stung by recent revelations that 
police informants had warned police of planning for the 3/11 
train bombing, but officials did not follow up.  Given this 
context, together with lingering fears spawned by the 3/11 
bombings, it is possible the Spanish police acted to disrupt 
the cell with the full knowledge that they may have 
insufficient evidence to successfully try the suspects. 
Garzon is a particularly aggressive judge who enjoys the 
limelight.  He may have determined that the arrests were 
justified by the need to derail any plans for terrorist 
attacks (and his own need for press attention), even if 
convictions would be difficult.  The discovery of this cell, 
and the ETA connection in particular, may shake the apparent 
conviction among some Spaniards that they are safe from 
terrorists now that the GOS has withdrawn troops from Iraq. 
Unfortunately, it is clear that Spain will remain an active 
front for the extemists in the war on terror.

) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Spain will convey a message to the Madrid 
Polisario representative calling on the Polisario to cease 
threats to resume armed conflict with Morocco.  MFA Maghreb 
Office Director Carlos Fernandez Arias also shared Spain\'s 
views on the state of play in Western Morocco, including GOS 
priorities for a UN resolution on Western Sahara.  Fernandez 
Arias said Former Secretary of State Baker was the \"best 
thing that ever happened\" for the Western Sahara negotiations 
and made a pitch for the proposal of another U.S. figure as 
the UNSYG\'s special envoy.  The Socialist government still 
seems to be feeling its way on Western Morocco, generating 
some confusion regarding GOS positions on the issue.  For 
now, Spain\'s primary objective is simply to keep the peace 
process alive.  End Summary. 
 
//GOS AGREES WITH USG ON POLISARIO THREATS TO RESUME COMBAT// 
 
2. (SBU) Poloff met with MFA Maghreb Office Director Carlos 
Fernandez Arias on 10/18 to convey ref A points requesting 
Spain approach the Madrid Polisario representative to express 
concern regarding recent Polisario threats to resume armed 
conflict in Western Sahara.  Fernandez said the USG points 
tracked with Spain\'s views, noting that GOS Deputy Foreign 
Minister Bernardino Leon had warned Polisario leaders in 
August against continuing to employ aggressive rhetoric. 
Fernandez plans to meet with local Polisario representative 
Brahim Gali in the next few days and promised to relay 
another cautionary message on behalf of the GOS.  He said 
Polisario leaders are well aware that talk of renewing the 
armed struggle is unrealistic, especially since it is not in 
Algeria\'s interests to allow the conflict to resume. 
 
//SPANISH OBJECTIVES IN WESTERN SAHARA// 
 
3. (C) Poloff noted that there was some confusion within the 
USG concerning Spain\'s views on next steps on Western Sahara 
and on the mandate of the SGSR Alvaro de Soto.  Fernandez 
said he was aware that Spain\'s positions required some 
clarification and said that the Spanish DCM in Washington had 
recently discussed the issue with NEA DAS Philo Dibble.  He 
said that the GOS continued to improve ties to Morocco in 
hopes that better relations would help nudge Rabat (and 
Paris) towards a more conciliatory posture on the Baker Plan. 
 Fernandez acknowledged that neither Morocco nor France has 
reciprocated thus far.  He described resolution of the 
Western Sahara issue as the linchpin to broader GOS 
objectives in the region, including the progressive economic 
and political integration of Maghreb states in order to 
stabilize Spain\'s shaky southern flank. 
 
4. (C) Fernandez described Polisario\'s current attitude as 
\"extremely tough,\" especially with respect to Alvaro de Soto. 
 Polisario had faith in Baker as an interlocutor with 
sufficient gravitas to honor commitments made to the parties. 
 They view de Soto as a mere UN functionary and associate him 
with his former boss, UN Secretary General Perez de Cuellar, 
who led the organization during the worst period in 
UN-Polisario relations.  Fernandez said Spain agreed with USG 
views on the importance of Polisario\'s release of the 
remaining Moroccan POW\'s, but noted that the Sahrawis are 
probably not disposed to trade away one of their few 
remaining points of leverage. 
 
//SPANISH SUGGESTIONS FOR A UN RESOLUTION// 
 
5. (C) Fernandez said the GOS will soon share with the USG, 
France, and the UK proposed ideas for a resolution on Western 
Sahara, to include five key components: 
 
-- Explicit support for the Baker Plan as the \"optimal 
political solution.\" 
 
-- An expression of support for UNSYG Annan and for his envoy 
Alvaro de Soto. 
 
-- A one-year mandate for the MINURSO mission (though 
Fernandez said six months would be acceptable to the GOS). 
 
-- Language that would give de Soto room for maneuver to get 
beyond Morocco\'s rejection of the Baker plan, as opposed to a 
call for de Soto to simply implement the plan without any 
possibility of modification. 
 
-- Retention of current funding levels for MINURSO. 
(Fernandez said he knew we had a different view on this 
issue, but said Spain\'s view is that MINURSO\'s presence 
creates pressure on both sides, especially Morocco, to remain 
engaged in the peace process.) 
 
//A PITCH FOR A U.S. ENVOY TO REPLACE BAKER// 
 
6. (C) Fernandez said that in his view and the view of many 
others in the MFA, Former Secretary Baker had been the \"best 
thing that ever happened\" for the Western Sahara peace 
process.  He said Baker\'s genius was in keeping the parties 
pointed in the right direction and in generating momentum for 
an otherwise stalled process.  Fernandez fears that with 
Baker\'s departure, the dynamic created by high-level USG 
interest will stall (especially in the case of Morocco) and 
both parties may simply retrench.  This would leave a 
festering and destabilizing wound in Moroccan-Algerian 
relations, blocking European plans to foment a more stable 
and prosperous Maghreb.  Fernandez said the best solution 
would be for another high-profile U.S. figure to take Baker\'s 
place as the UNSYG\'s personal envoy.  He asked that poloff 
inquire with the Department whether this would be possible. 
Poloff agreed to forward the inquiry, but said he was unaware 
of any consideration of another U.S. candidate for the 
position. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
7. (C) We believe the main reason for the mixed signals 
regarding GOS positions on Western Sahara is that the GOS 
itself is still working out its approach on the issue. 
Whereas Maghreb expert Fernandez has stressed continuity in 
GOS policy, his superiors in the MFA have sent positive 
signals towards Morocco and France in hopes that those 
governments would reciprocate and show greater flexibility 
towards the Baker Plan.  This strategy has not succeeded and 
the GOS now seems to be tacking towards less ambitious 
objectives.  Spain\'s fundamental objective is to keep the 
peace process alive and both parties at the table.  Anything 
short of a mutually-agreed solution is seen as a lasting 
threat to Spanish interests in the Maghreb.

2.  Embassy understands that no assistance is necessary. 
 
3.  Visitors are reminded that bearers of diplomatic and 
official passports coming to Spain on official business need 
to obtain a Spanish visa prior to arrival in Spain. 
 
4.  THREAT ASSESSMENT: 
 
In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at

SUBJECT: PRESS REPORTS PROGRESS IN BREAKING UP TRAFFICKING 
IN PERSONS NETWORKS 
 
 
The Spanish daily ABC reported September 18 that the Spanish 
National Police have dismantled one hundred illegal 
immigration, document falsification, and prostitution 
networks during 2004.  Additionally, more than 300 people 
have been arrested during the year by the Immigration Network 
and False Documents Group within the National Police. 
Arrests stopped or hindered human trafficking criminal 
networks run by Eastern Europeans, primarily led by Romanians 
but also by Albanians; South American networks run by 
Ecuadorians, Peruvians, and Colombians; and Asian networks, 
where the Chinese \"mafia\" is reportedly dominant.  The 
Spanish National Police broke up 70 criminal networks and 
made 200 arrests during 2003.  In 2004, the police are on 
pace to arrest greater numbers of human traffickers according 
to press reporting.  The ABC report provides further possible 
insights into human trafficking issues, which we will 
investigate with GOS authorities in our discussions on TIP.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/05/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PHUM, PGOV, CU, SP 
SUBJECT: CUBA: SPAIN CONFIDENT IT CAN OVERTURN EU MEASURES 
ON SUPPORT FOR OPPOSITION 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick; reason 1.5 (B) an 
d (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Spain is determined to roll back key 
elements of the June 2003 EU \"restrictive measures\" on Cuba 
implemented in the wake of Castro\'s crackdown on the 
opposition.  MFA officials are confident they have sufficient 
support within the EU to do so.  The GOS counts the UK, 
France, Sweden, Greece, Belgium, Austria, and Finland allies 
in their efforts to abolish the policy requiring EU missions 
to invite dissidents to national day celebrations.  Deputy 
Foreign Minister Bernardino Leon told visiting EUR DAS Glyn 
Davies that Spain wants to reestablish contacts with GOC 
officials in order to be able to influence the post-Castro 
leadership.  MFA Director General for Latin America Javier 
Sandomingo will travel to Cuba on 10/27, in part to explain 
Spain\'s inititative to the dissident community.  Sandomingo 
would like to brief USG officials in Washington as well, 
perhaps in late November.  Popular Party members are critical 
of Zapatero\'s approach on Cuba, but do not seem to have the 
political weight to rein in GOS policy on Cuba. 
 
2. (C) Madrid cannot be moved on this issue.  We believe the 
only way to blunt Spain\'s ambitions on EU Cuba policy is to 
energize Cuba critics within the EU, such as Poland and the 
Czech Republic, in order to prevent an EU consensus in 
Brussels in favor of Spain\'s new approach. End Summary. 
 
//SPAIN SHIFTS EMPHASIS FROM CIVIL SOCIETY TO CUBAN 
GOVERNMENT// 
 
3. (C) Shortly after Zapatero came to office, MFA and other 
government officials indicated they wanted to take a \"new\" 
approach on Cuba out of frustration with their lack of access 
to Cuban Government interlocutors.  They blamed the June 2003 
EU measures in support of Cuban dissidents -- especially the 
policy of inviting dissidents to EU national day celebrations 
-- as a major impediment to normal diplomatic relations with 
the GOC.  Deputy FM Leon told EUR DAS Davies on 10/19 that 
Spain wants to eliminate the EU policy on invitations in 
order to regain access to, and perhaps influence, GOC 
officials who could lead Cuba once Castro is gone.  Leon said 
Spain\'s objective is to prevent chaos in Cuba in the 
post-Castro era.  He told Davies that MFA Director General 
for Latin America Sandomingo would travel to Cuba soon and 
would also like to visit Washington at a later date to brief 
USG officials.  Davies underscored USG policy on Cuba and 
warned against policies that would allow Castro to simply eat 
\"carrots\" handed him by foreign interlocutors without 
requiring Castro to ease political and economic restrictions. 
 
 
//MFA - EU MEASURES WERE \"A MISTAKE FROM THE START\"// 
 
4. (C) Poloff met with MFA Deputy Director General for the 
Caribbean Pablo Gomez de Olea on 10/21 to get a readout on 
the 10/19 EU Latin American Committee (COLAT) meeting on Cuba 
and to express USG concern regarding the direction of GOS 
policy towards Cuba.  Gomez said that, contrary to press 
reports, the COLAT meeting had gone well from Spain\'s 
perspective.  The GOS had not expected a vote on its proposal 
to \"modify\" the June 2003 measures on Cuba and was content 
with the COLAT\'s decision to request input from resident EU 
missions in Havana for a November 16 discussion.  Gomez 
listed the UK, France, Sweden, Greece, Belgium, Austria and 
Finland as strong backers of the Spanish proposal. 
 
5. (C) In an effort to block new EU members states viewed as 
hostile to Cuba from scuttling Madrid\'s plans, Spain asked 
that only countries with an embassy in Cuba (i.e. - those 
affected by the Cuban \"freezout\" of EU diplomats) vote on 
whether to eliminate the invitation of dissidents to national 
day events.  Poloff noted that Finland - a GOS supporter on 
Cuba - has no embassy in Havana, while the Czech Republic and 
Poland do have missions in Havana and could have a different 
view.  Gomez said Poland and the Czech Republic are coming 
around to Spain\'s view on the issue. 
 
6. (C) Gomez, a holdover from the Aznar administration, 
complained that the 2003 EU measures were \"a mistake from the 
start\" and argued that even had the Popular Party (PP) won 
the March elections the GOS would still seek to roll them 
back.  He said the Greek EU Presidency had rammed the 
measures through in 2003 without proper consideration and 
without leaving the EU an exit strategy in case the measures 
backfired.  Gomez said that the EU should simply have enacted 
the measures without announcing them and should have made the 
invitation of dissidents voluntary in order to leave EU 
missions some wiggle room.  He said it was regretable that 
some EU missions had broken EU discipline by canceling 
national day events in order to avoid conflict with the GOC, 
citing Austria as a particularly egregious example. 
 
//SPAIN STILL CARES ABOUT THE OPPOSITION, BUT...// 
 
7. (C) Poloff said the USG has significant reservations about 
the change in Spanish policy towards Cuba, fearing Castro 
will interpret it as a victory for Cuban intransigience on 
human rights.  Gomez insisted that Spain remains committed to 
pressing for improvements in Cuba\'s human rights practices. 
He reiterated previous assertions that Spain\'s plans 
including ramped up contacts with the opposition in meetings 
other than national day events.  He said DG Sandomingo\'s 
primary reason for going to Cuba on 10/27 is to meet with the 
opposition and seek their understanding with respect to 
Spain\'s new direction.  He asserted that most dissidents had 
already indicated their acceptance of Spain\'s rationale, with 
only \"right wing\" activists Oswaldo Paya and Martha Beatriz 
Roque refusing to budge in part because the GOS had failed to 
engage them sufficiently on the issue.  Poloff challenged 
Gomez on this point, noting that center-left activist 
Vladimiro Roca had recently sent a scathing letter to the GOS 
accusing Spain of abandoning the opposition.  Gomez said the 
Spanish Embassy in Havana had spoken with Roca and convinced 
him of Spain\'s good intentions.  (NOTE: In a separate 
meeting, the brother of Oswaldo Paya told poloff that 
Sandomingo had asked him in August how Paya would view the 
termination of invitations to national day events.  The 
brother responded that Paya would reject the shift in policy, 
since it was the EU\'s only concrete measure in support for 
pro-democracy activists in Cuba.  END NOTE.) 
 
8. (C) Poloff noted FM Moratinos\' recent comments to the 
press suggesting that Spain\'s policy shift had led to the 
release of seven jailed dissidents since mid 2004, saying the 
USG saw no connection between Spanish diplomacy and the 
release of the dissidents.  Gomez replied that Moratinos\' 
comments had been misinterpreted.  What he meant to say was 
that the EU measures had not led to the release of any 
dissidents and that they were only let go when Spain began 
speaking of the need for dialogue with the Castro regime. 
However, Gomez agreed with poloff\'s point that Castro more 
likely had his own reasons for releasing the detainees, 
irrespective of any Spanish initiatives. 
 
9. (C) Asked about Cuban Foreign Minister Perez Roque\'s 
recent favorable comments regarding Zapatero\'s Cuba policy, 
Gomez said neither the statements of the GOC nor those of the 
opposition had an influence on Spanish policy.  He said Spain 
feels no sense of urgency and will adjust its Cuba policy at 
a pace determined by Madrid\'s long-term objectives in Cuba. 
Poloff raised rumors circulating through Madrid\'s exile 
community that political prisoner Raul Rivero would be 
released by the GOC in order to reward Zapatero and give him 
leverage to ease EU policies towards Cuba. Gomez discounted 
the rumors, saying Rivero is too big a prize for the GOC to 
release at the moment, given Castro\'s personal dislike for 
the jailed poet. 
 
 //PP A GADFLY ON CUBA, BUT CAN\'T SWAY GOS POLICY// 
 
10. (C) On 10/21, DCM, the political counselor, and poloff 
met with PP Parliamentarian and chief of the PP\'s 
International Affairs DepartmentJorge Moragas and PP Senator 
Luis Fraga to discuss foreign policy issues, including Cuba. 
Moragas, who made front page news in Spain when he was denied 
entry to Cuba on 10/16 for planning to meet with dissidents, 
said GOS policy on Cuba is a \"disaster.\"  He said Spanish and 
EU policies may not be able to influence Castro, but they 
should at the very least fall on the side of a principled 
defense of human rights.  Moragas, who appears close to both 
PP leader Mariano Rajoy and former President Aznar, favors a 
\"scorched-earth\" style of opposition and said the PP would 
keep Cuba at the forefront of its differences with the 
Socialist government.  He called on the USG to encourage 
Central European EU members to block Spanish initiatives in 
Brussels and make clear to Zapatero Washington\'s differences 
with Spain on Cuba. 
 
11. (C) Fraga, who is friendly with FM Moratinos and recently 
traveled with Socialist officials to Chile and Colombia and 
says he will travel with Zapatero\'s delegation to the Ibero 
American Summit in Costa Rica, was more conciliatory, saying 
he is attempting to broker joint PP-PSOE positions on policy 
towards Cuba (as well on policy towards relations with the 
U.S.)  He agreed with the GOS thesis that there are figures 
within the GOC who could be influenced by Spain, but thought 
the GOS had taken the wrong approach in adjusting its policy. 
 He said the PP should balance PP \"sticks\" (i.e. - Moragas) 
with \"carrots\" such as his pursuit of a common policy on 
Cuba.  Interestingly, both Fraga and Moragas described MFA 
officials Sandomingo and Gomez de Olea in favorable terms, 
saying that GOS direction on Cuba was driven by PSOE 
operatives around FM Moratinos and President Zapatero. 
Neither legislator seemed optimistic that the PP would be 
able to alter Zapatero\'s Cuba policy. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
12. (C) We are not going to be able to convince the GOS to 
refrain from taking the lead within the EU to revamp policy 
towards Cuba.  MFA hands may be counseling a correct 
diplomatic approach in making this shift, but they 
nevertheless strongly support the decision to terminate the 
invitation of dissidents to national day celebrations.  We 
are not swayed by GOS assertions that they will ramp up other 
contacts with dissidents since there is no reason to believe 
the Spanish ambassador in Havana would approach such contacts 
with any enthusiasm. 
 
13. (C) However, Spain\'s efforts may still be blunted at the 
EU level if a country such as Poland or the Czech Republic 
were able to block consensus on Spain\'s proposals during the 
November 16 COLAT.  Such a loss in momentum might be enough 
of a setback to convince Zapatero and FM Moratinos that 
changing EU Cuba policy is not worth the political effort.  A 
loss in Brussels would also open the door for domestic 
critics of Zapatero\'s approach towards Cuba, which would act 
as a further brake on Socialist activism on Cuba.

Classified By: ECONCOUNS WHITNEY BAIRD PER 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1.  (U) ESTHOFF made reftel points October 19-22 to:  (1) 
Juan Antonio Rubio, Director General of the Center for 
Energy, Environment, and Technology Investigation (CIEMAT); 
(2) Francisco Javier Arana Landa, Deputy Director General for 
Nuclear Energy, Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce; 
(3) Carlos Alejaldre Losilla, Director General for Technology 
Policy, Ministry of Science and Education; and, (4) Julio 
Barcelo, Commissioner, Nuclear Security Council (CSN - 
Spain\'s Nuclear Regulatory Commission equivalent). 
 
2.  (C)  Arana said he agreed on the importance of 
maintaining the six-party framework, arguing that it would 
simply be too expensive for the world to pursue two ITERs 
(one EU/Russia/China; the other U.S./Japan/South Korea).  He 
thought the initial French brush-off of the Japanese 
\"host/non-host\" offer was merely a negotiating tactic 
designed to exact as many concessions as possible from the 
Japanese.  He felt France would come around in the end and 
provide Tokyo a more constructive response. 
 
3.  (C)  Barcelo also agreed with our points, but unlike 
Arana, was convinced that Paris was determined \"for the glory 
of France\" to pursue an EU-centric ITER without U.S. 
participation.  Alejaldre, who will lead the Spanish team to 
the Vienna meeting, told ESTHOFF that the session had been 
postponed until November 9.  He said Spain strongly supports 
the six-party framework and will so argue at the November 9 
meeting and within subsequent EU councils.  Rubio also agreed 
that staying with the six-party framework would be ideal.  As 
to whether Spain would lobby France to not go alone, Rubio 
frankly responded, \"it depends what France might offer Spain\" 
in the context of an EU-centric project. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT:  Four senior interlocutors; four different 
visions.  It is clear that we have a potential ally in Spain, 
which lost out to France in the intra-EU contest to be the 
ITER host.  But, of course, the key question and big unknown 
is whether this sympathy will result in Spain arguing 
strenuously within EU councils to keep to the six-party 
framework.  One of the six major planks of Spain\'s \"new\" 
Socialist Government is \"the return to Europe.\"  This has 
often resulted in a \"give the French and Germans what they 
want\" policy line.  Our interlocutors, however, thought the 
ITER has not been overly politicized  (i.e., it remains off 
the Socialist\'s radar screen).  Thus, on balance, we believe 
Spain will at least initially take our side on this one when 
the EU sits down on November 25 to make its decision. 
However, should France be serious about the EU going alone 
(or without the U.S.), we should not expect Spain to fall on 
its sword to defend the six-party framework.

SUBJECT: SPAIN COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR JEFFERY BROWN 
 
REF: 261925Z OCT 04 
 
1.  Embassy welcomes and grants country clearance to Jeffery 
Brown, Senior Deputy Comptroller, United States Treasury 
Department, to travel to Madrid, Spain from November 4-7, 
2004.  The purpose of this visit is to participate in a 
conference entitled, \"Prudential Regulation and Banking 
Supervision.\" 
 
2.  Embassy understands that no assistance is necessary. 
 
3.  Visitors are reminded that bearers of diplomatic and 
official passports coming to Spain on official business need 
to obtain a Spanish visa prior to arrival in Spain. 
 
4.  THREAT ASSESSMENT: 
 
In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel/state.gov.  In addition to information on the 
Internet, U.S. travelers can hear recorded information by 
calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at 
202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, or receive 
information by automated telefax by dialing 202-647-3000 from

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS MINISTER OF JUSTICE TO DISCUSS 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TIP ISSUES 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick; reason 1.5 (B) an 
d (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  The Ambassador met with Minister of Justice 
Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar on October 21 to discuss law 
enforcement issues, including counterterrorism cooperation, 
trafficking in persons, and Mutual Legal Assistance and 
Extradition treaties (MLAT).  The Ambassador stressed the 
USG\'s interest in highlighting the good ties between the U.S. 
and Spain, particularly on law enforcement issues.  Aguilar 
agreed on the importance of working together to combat all 
forms of international crime and described the level of USG 
cooperation with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) as 
\"excellent.\"  Asked how cooperation could be improved, 
Aguilar said the GOS would like to see more timely responses 
to GOS requests for USG information in GOS counterterrorism 
investigations.  He said the GOS is committed to combating 
trafficking in persons.  On other matters, Aguilar discussed 
the Zapatero Government\'s conflict with the Catholic Church 
on a range of GOS social initiatives and said he was amazed 
by the growth of Protestant and other non-traditional 
denominations in Spain.  Aguilar is among the most positive 
of Zapatero\'s officials towards the USG and is well placed to 
help us on security matters.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador and DCM met with Justice Minister 
Aguilar to discuss a range of law enforcement issues.  The 
Ambassador thanked Aguilar for Spain\'s high level of 
cooperation with the USG on law enforcement issues, including 
in the fight against terrorism.  The Ambassador expressed the 
USG\'s appreciation for the Spanish Attorney General\'s 
proposal to begin talks with the USG on the formation of a 
joint counterterror investigation team.  Aguilar agreed with 
the Ambassador on the importance of strong bilateral 
cooperation on law enforcement issues, describing the level 
of USG agencies\' cooperation with their Spanish counterparts 
as \"excellent.\" 
 
//TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS// 
 
3. (C) The Ambassador underlined the importance to the USG of 
combating traficking in persons (TIP), noting that the 
Embassy had received significant cooperation from GOS 
contacts in preparing the 2003 TIP report.  Aguilar said the 
GOS understands the scope of the TIP problem in Spain and is 
committed to dismantling TIP networks.  He said he had been 
aware of the problems of East European victims discussed in 
the TIP report, but was surprised by the number of African 
prostitutes making their way to Spain via Maghrebi smuggling 
routes.  The DCM said the USG found government statistics 
related to TIP a particularly useful tool for gauging 
international trafficking patterns.  Aguilar said GOS would 
gladly share TIP statistics with the Embassy. 
 
//LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION// 
 
4. (C) Aguilar and the Ambassador discussed upcoming talks in 
Madrid between USG and GOS legal officials to work out the 
final details of the bilateral protocol to the Mulitlateral 
Extradition and Legal Assistance treaties (MLAT).  Aguilar 
remarked on the continuing political sensitivity for Spanish 
authorities on extraditions related to death penalty cases. 
He nonetheless assured the Ambassador that the MLAT 
discussions were on track from the Spanish perspective and 
that all pending issues would be resolved in the late 
November or early December meeting of bilateral legal 
experts.  The Ambassador asked whether Spain has replaced its 
Central Authority for enforcement of the Hague Convention on 
Parental Child Abduction, a pending issue of importance to 
our Mission.  Aguilar provided the name of the official in 
the Ministry of Justice who oversees the Central Authority, 
but indicated the position has not yet been filled. 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador asked what the USG could do better in 
terms of law enforcement cooperation.  After consulting 
briefly with his aides, Aguilar said the GOS would like a 
more timely response from USG agencies on Spanish requests 
for information related to counterterrorism investigations. 
(NOTE: This stems from complaints by some Spanish officials, 
notably high-profile judge Baltasar Garzon, that the USG is 
\"impeding\" Spanish investigations by not making intelligence 
information available to Spanish prosecutors for use in 
court.  This is likely to remain a point of contention, 
especially in cases where GOS police lack information that 
can be used in court.  END NOTE).  However, Aguilar did not 
press the issue and stressed Spain\'s overall satisfaction 
with the level of USG cooperation. 
 
//RISING IMPORTANCE OF NON-TRADITIONAL RELIGIONS// 
 
6. (C) Switching from law enforcement matters to GOS 
relations with religious organizations (which also falls 
under the purview of the Ministry of Justice), Aguilar 
defended the Zapatero Government\'s iniative to reduce the 
influence of the Catholic Church and to decrease some of the 
government benefits enjoyed by the Church but not by other 
denominations.  He said accusations that Zapatero was 
anti-Catholic Church were unfair; the GOS wants a truly 
secular state without providing special advantages to any 
particular group.  Aguilar said Spain\'s religious demography 
was vastly more complex than in the past, noting the 
impressive rise of Protestant churches, Mormon congregations, 
and, most recently, the opening of a Church of Scientology 
center in downtown Madrid. 
 
//BIOGRAPHIC NOTES// 
 
7. (C) Aguilar was born in 1961 in the Canary Islands. 
Within the PSOE, Aguilar has served as Assistant Spokesman 
(1993-1998), as a member of the party\'s Executive Committee, 
and as an election coordinator.  He was one of the PSOE 
negotiators in security discussions with the Popular Party 
that resulted in the PSOE/PP Anti-Terrorist Pact.  He holds a 
masters degree from the University of Granada, a law degree 
from the University of Bologna, and was chair of the School 
of Constitutional Law at the University of Las Palmas. 
Aguilar also received a degree from the Fletcher School of 
Law and Diplomacy, spending two years in the U.S. during his 
studies.  He is friendly towards the USG and will likely be a 
useful interlocutor on law enforcement issues throughout his 
tenure as Minister.

 1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Poloff discussed Iraq, Iran, the Middle 
East Peace Process, Russia, Sudan, Somalia, Ukraine, Kosovo, 
and North Cyprus with Enrique Mora Benavente, MFA Head of EU 
Planning, on October 26 and October 28.  Mora Benavente said 
that EU police training in Iraq would take place after 
January elections, most likely in Amman.  EU member states 
are awaiting the results of further negotiations with Iran 
before recommending UN Security Council action.  The EU 
continues to be focused on improving the security situation 
with the Palestinians in order to help the Middle East peace 
process.  Mora Benavente does not expect much progress in 
EU-Russian relations at the bilateral summit at the Hague. 
The EU will support Sudan financially and logistically, and 
welcomes the restarting of the Abuja peace process.  The EU 
supports efforts of new Somali president Abdullahi Yusuf, but 
Spanish officials are not optimistic that he will succeed. 
Spain shares U.S. concerns about the fairness of Ukrainian 
elections, but the EU is unlikely to make a statement prior 
to the elections.  The EU shares U.S. views over recent 
Kosovo elections.  The next GAERC meetings on November 22 
will approve two regulations to North Cyprus, although the 
regulation concerning trade with North Cyprus will likely 
need to be amended. END SUMMARY 
 
---- 
IRAQ 
---- 
 
2.  (C)  Mora Benavente said that police training and 
assistance would take place after the Iraqi elections in 
January.  In a best case scenario the training would take 
place in Baghdad or Basra, but depending on the security 
situation, training will more likely take place in Amman. 
When Mora Benavente was presented with the updated talking 
point about the Iraqi Interim Government recommending that as 
much training as possible take place in Iraq, Mora Benavente 
said that this was still possible, but that there is stronger 
support within the EU to hold the training outside of Iraq. 
The planning team will work within the European Security and 
Defense Policy framework, similar to the framework used in 
Bosnia. 
 
---- 
IRAN 
---- 
 
3.  (C)  Javier Solana, the EU High Representative for the 
Common Foreign and Security Policy, met with political 
representatives from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and 
Iran in Vienna October 27 concerning trying to secure Iran\'s 
agreement to suspend indefinitely all nuclear enrichment 
activity.  Discussions will continue over the weekend.  If 
Iran has not suspended its enrichment activities before the 
November 25-26 IAEA Board of Governors meetings, the Board of 
Governors should tell the UNSC that Iran is non-compliant 
with the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  If Iran agrees to abandon 
its enrichment activities, the EU would recommend no further 
Security Council action against Iran, and the EU would offer 
to start trade cooperation negotiations. 
 
----------------- 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
----------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Mora Benavente agreed with reftel talking points, 
but said that EU policy on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute is 
definitely not U.S. policy.  The EU is focused on improving 
the security situation with the Palestinians.  In expressing 
a personal view, Mora Benavente said that Sharon\'s objectives 
have nothing to do with reality. 
 
------ 
RUSSIA 
------ 
 
5.  (C)  Mora Benavente does not expect any big advances in 
the four areas of bilateral relations--external security, 
energy, justice / domestic affairs, and economic 
cooperation--between the EU and Russia during the EU-Russia 
Summit at the Hague.  He sees two major stumbling blocks to 
increased cooperation.  First, Russia has been backtracking 
on human rights and its respect for democracy; and second, EU 
efforts at cooperation and engagement in the states of the 
former Soviet Union are not accepted by the Russians. 
 
----- 
SUDAN 
----- 
 
6.  (C)  The EU will support Sudan financially, logistically, 
and with people, although the AU does not want non-African 
troops on the ground.  Spain is planning on sending 7-8 
planners.  Spain will continue to provide financial and 
humanitarian aid to the victims in Sudan.  Spain welcomes the 
restarting the Abuja peace process and hopes for quick 
results. 
 
------- 
SOMALIA 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  Spain welcomes the election of Abdullahi Yusuf as 
president of Somalia.  The EU will support the transitional 
government, but at this time they do not know of Yusuf\'s 
intentions; therefore, financial support is unlikely. 
Spanish officials are not very optimistic that Yusuf will 
succeed. 
 
------- 
UKRAINE 
------- 
 
8.  (C)  Spain and the EU share U.S. concerns about the 
fairness of the Ukrainian elections.  Mora Benavente wondered 
how an election could be fair when the press is controlled by 
the government\'s candidate and a foreign head of state, 
Russia\'s Vladimir Putin, campaigned for Viktor Yanukovych, 
incumbent Leonid Kuchma\'s designates successor, for three 
days.  Mora Benavente said that there would be discussions of 
the Ukrainian elections among EU member states, but that an 
EU statement condemning the election process before the 
election could be counterproductive, as the government could 
use a statement as an election issue to condemn foreign 
meddling in the process. 
 
------ 
KOSOVO 
------ 
 
9.  (C)  Mora Benavente said that the elections in Kosovo 
were free and fair, but the low Serb turnout was 
disappointing.  The most urgent priority in Kosovo is to 
convene parliament and form a government.  Security for 
minority communities and the rebuilding of houses lost in 
riots should be priorities of the new autonomous authorities. 
 The EU also supports the efforts of Special Representative 
of the Secretary General (SRSG) Soren Jessen-Petersen to 
transfer additional non-sovereign competencies to the 
Provisional Institutions of Self Government (PISG) to build 
capacity and help them meet standards.  Mora Benavente added 
that the EU is heavily invested in Kosovo, and has so far 
seen few results.  He said that the EU currently has no 
position on the Eide Report.

10.  (C)  Mora Benavente said that the next General Affairs 
Council on November 22 will approve two regulations relating 
to North Cyprus.  There will be no problems approving the 
direct aid regulation for North Cyprus.  The companion 
regulation advocating increased trade and economic 
cooperation with North Cyprus will likely face difficulties 
being approved and will need to be amended to reach unanimity 
among the EU.  Direct trade with North Cyprus is dependent on 
sovereignty issues found in Cyprus\' EU accession treaty and 
therefore needs unanimity among all EU states.

REF: STATE 231686 
 
1.  (SBU) In response to REFTEL, the Emergency Action 
Committee was consulted regarding specific security concerns 
for possible repercussions from the deteriorating health of 
Arafat.  With many EAC members already committed to outside 
meetings during the day, but understanding the necessity of a 
prompt response, the EAC was consulted through various 
\"mini-meetings\" as their schedules allowed.  The RSO acted as 
the liaison and conduit for all responses. 
 
2.  (SBU) The State Department Section Head\'s meeting 
discussed REFTEL and concurred that no specific concerns 
exist at this time regarding the Subject.  RSO contacted ORA, 
Legat, DEA, DHS, TSA, and DAO, to discuss the implications 
and concerns for security for Mission Spain should Arafat\'s 
health deteriorate and all unanimously expressed the opinion 
that the situation does not currently impact on Mission.  The 
Consul General in Barcelona also provided his input stating 
that he views no particular threat or concern at this time 
generated from this topic. 
 
3.  (U) Mission Spain will continue to monitor the situation 
and condition of PLO Chairman Arafat and should any concerns 
arise, Mission will immediately notify the Department.

EUROPE 
 
REF: A. MADRID 03446

Classified By: Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Political Counselor, 
Reasons 1.4. (B) & (D) 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY:  Dr. Thomas Zarzecki of INR/SPM, accompanied 
by poloff, provided an intelligence briefing to an 
interagency GOS audience on October 25 on arms procurement 
attempts in European countries by state sponsors of 
terrorism, especially Iran.  The well-received briefing 
sparked discussion about joint US-Spanish non-proliferation 
efforts and the problems posed by brokers using Spain as a 
transshipment point.  In side meetings, GOS officials raised 
specific questions about the Spanish entity Telstar, and we 
stressed the need to further investigate the activities of 
Izar Construcciones in providing military equipment to Iran. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Poloff and Dr. Zarzecki met with an interagency GOS 
delegation composed of MFA Deputy Director General of 
International Disarmament Affairs Marcos Rodriguez Cantero 
and his assistant Luis Gomez Nogueira; Director General of 
International Economic Relations Javier Hergueta Garcia; 
Ministry of Interior Commissioner General for Information 
Jesus Lira Calvo; Ministry of Defense officials Maria Jose 
Mateo, Raphael Lopez, and Jose Quevedo Ruiz; and Ministry of 
Industry, Tourism, and Trade Deputy Director General of 
Nuclear Energy Ana Belen Manzano Negro. 
 
3.  (S) Poloff began by noting that the briefing followed a 
discussion of the issue by  Secretary Powell and Foreign 
Minister Moratinos earlier this year, and underlined USG\'s 
desire to frame specific recent proliferation cases that the 
USG had raised with the GOS within the context of our 
understanding of Iran\'s overall European arms procurement 
efforts.  The briefing covered the consistent efforts by Iran 
and other state sponsors of terrorism to acquire military and 
dual-use equipment in Spain and other European countries 
(NOTE:  This was a slightly modified version of the briefing 
that Zarzecki provided to Italian government officials in 
March 2004.  END NOTE.) 
 
4.  (S) The briefing was well received by GOS officials. 
Deputy DG Rodriguez stated that Spain\'s existing control 
regime for military goods was sufficiently strong to prevent 
any such Iranian purchase efforts.  He noted that controlling 
dual-use items was more problematic.  The GOS had recently 
approved a catchall regulation in Spain\'s new export control 
laws that would assist GOS efforts in this area.  MOD 
official Lopez reiterated Rodriguez, sentiment, and he and 
Quevedo noted that some of the military goods under 
discussion were US-origin items transshipped through Spain to 
Iran and other destinations.  Poloff and Dr. Zarzecki agreed 
that the GOS and USG needed to work together to stem the flow 
of US-origin items transshipped through Spain (as in the case 
of the Spanish firm Winter Aircraft Products, which has 
brokered US-origin fighter aircraft spare parts to Iran in 
the past), but that most of the items mentioned in the 
briefing and in past demarches were of Spanish-origin and not 
sourced in the US.  While the overall issue of Spain as a 
transshipment country was undoubtedly important, the focus of 
the current briefing was on the activities of firms, 
particularly Izar, that were conducting business on Spanish 
soil. 
 
5. (S) Before and after the briefing, Zarzecki had two 
pull-asides with GOS officials.  DG Hergueta raised the issue 
of USG sanctions recently imposed on the Spanish firm Telstar 
under the Iran Non-Proliferation Act, asking the USG to 
identify the specific equipment exported by Telstar that 
triggered the sanctions.  He said the GOS was eager to 
resolve this issue, noting that Telstar had a good reputation 
in the GOS for obeying export control regulations and was 
happy to cooperate in the further investigation of this case. 
  He also noted that Telstar\'s business in the US would be 
hurt by the sanctions and that any violations of export 
controls by Telstar were likely inadvertent.  We agreed to 
work with GOS on the case and provide the requested 
information as soon as possible. 
 
6. (S) In a side meeting, Zarzecki also underlined to MOD 
official Lopez USG concerns regarding Izar\'s activities with 
Iran.  Zarzecki noted that the previously-shared information 
on the travel of an Izar delegation to Iran in January 2004 
to negotiate military sales indicated serious intent on the 
part of the firm, and required further investigation (ref A 
and B)--a request which Lopez took seriously. 
 
7. (S) COMMENT:  The intelligence briefing seemed to open the 
door to further exchanges with GOS officials on specific 
non-proliferation matters, and underlined USG interest in 
preventing Iranian military and dual-use procurements. 
Embassy plans to follow-up on several specific cases: 
providing GOS with releasable information when received from 
Washington on Telstar information; receiving a GOS update on 
the status of their investigation into Winter Aircraft 
Products (ref A); and, as necessary, continued engagement on 
Izar\'s relationship with Iran.  END COMMENT 
 
8. (C) Zarzecki has cleared on this cable.

SUBJECT: FUTURE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY IN SPAIN 
 
REF: A. MADRID 3817 
     B. PARIS 7832 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  High oil prices and the ever more 
apparent economic costs of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol 
should guarantee that the possibility of constructing new 
nuclear power plants in Spain remains the subject of public 
debate.  However, given that the Zapatero Government will 
not/not have to take any significant license-related decision 
with respect to Spain\'s nine operating nuclear reactors until 
2008, we believe that Zapatero will avoid confronting this 
sensitive issue during the 2004-8 term of the current 
Congress.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  Spanish business headlines, like those in many other 
EU economies, have trumpeted the return of the nuclear energy 
option.  Pointing to oil at over USD 50 a barrel, and the 
growing realization that compliance with the Kyoto Protocol\'s 
restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions will likely increase 
energy costs, the Spanish business press has called for the 
government to reconsider its 1983 moratorium on the 
construction of new nuclear reactors.  (NOTE:  Spain\'s 
alleged nuclear power plant construction moratorium is 
actually a myth.  The Socialist Government of Felipe Gonzalez 
did indeed impose such a moratorium in 1983, halting 
construction of five nuclear power plants.  This moratorium 
was finalized in the 1994 decision (also by Gonzalez) to 
formally abandon the construction of these five facilities. 
However, in 1997, the then newly elected Popular Party (PP) 
Government removed the construction ban in the context of a 
broader effort to liberalize the Spanish electricity market. 
Since 1997, the moratorium has been, more than anything, 
self-imposed (i.e., industry preferring to avoid forcing the 
government\'s hand on the question, knowing that construction 
of additional nuclear power plants would prove too 
controversial and thus might not make business sense).  END 
NOTE). 
 
3.  (SBU)  To get a handle on whether Spain could actually 
resume constructing nuclear power reactors, ESTHOFF conducted 
a round of late October meetings with key players in the 
Spanish nuclear equation including:  (1) Juan Antonio Rubio, 
Director General of the Center for Energy, Environment, and 
Technology Investigation (CIEMAT); (2) Francisco Javier Arana 
Landa, Deputy Director General for Nuclear Energy, Ministry 
of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce; (3) Julio Barcelo, 
Commissioner, Nuclear Security Council (NSC - Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission equivalent); and, (4) Joan Esteve, Head 
of Plans and Studies of the Catalan Energy Institute 
(Catalonia\'s energy ministry).  All four agreed that the 
current Zapatero Government (2004-8) will not/not take any 
significant decision regarding the future direction of 
nuclear power in Spain, preferring to leave that 
controversial decision to the next government.  All four 
bolstered their views with the same arguments. 
 
4.  (U)  Spain currently has nine reactors operating in seven 
locations providing about 24 percent of the country\'s 
electricity.  One of the nine, Zorita (near Guadalajara) will 
be closed in April 2006 after 38 years of operation.  The 
decision to close Zorita was taken by the previous Popular 
Party Government and was not controversial, as Zorita was a 
test reactor and had already enjoyed one operating license 
extension (2001-6).  Given its small size, Zorita\'s closure 
will only reduce the nuclear share Spain\'s electricity 
generation to about 23.5 percent (from 24 percent). 
 
5.  (SBU)  The next reactor license set to expire is that of 
Garona (near Burgos), which must shut in 2009 unless its 
operating license is extended.  Barcelo said Garona\'s owner 
must file a permit extension request by 2006 (to avoid 
mandatory shut down in 2009) and that the NSC was required to 
prepare a recommendation regarding the expected request that 
same year.  He presumes the NSC will recommend extending the 
license of this facility, which opened in 1971.  However, he 
stressed that since Garona\'s license only expires in 2009, 
the GOS (i.e., Arana\'s office inside the Industry Ministry) 
is not likely to adjudicate the NSC recommendation until 2008 
(after the next general elections).  Barcelo and the others 
said the Garona decision would be the long awaited indicator 
of GOS views vis-a-vis the future of nuclear energy in Spain. 
 An extension would revive the hopes of those who support new 
nuclear power plant construction.  An extension denial would 
seal the fate of Spain\'s nuclear future, at least for the 
short-term.  The other three interlocutors fully agreed with 
Barcelo. 
 
6.  (SBU)  After Garona, the Government will have a respite 
from further tough nuclear power plant decisions, as Spain\'s 
other seven reactors (not including Zorita and Garona) date 
from the 1980s and hold 40 year operating permits.  This 
means that any license extension requests for these seven 
facilities would not be adjudicated until the 2020s. 
However, Spain is required by domestic law/regulation to 
establish by 2010 a centralized nuclear waste storage 
facility.  NRC Commissioner Barcelo said the debate over the 
site (and the NIMBY sentiments it will undoubtedly stir up), 
would form the back drop against which the Garona decision is 
taken.  He believed this debate would help the foes of 
nuclear energy.  But on the other hand, he added, electricity 
costs were expected to rise over the next five years.  This, 
he believed, would increase pressure to reconsider the 
nuclear option. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Of the four contacts, Industry Ministry Deputy 
Director General for Nuclear Energy Francisco Javier Arana 
Landa was clearly the most pessimistic about the short-term 
prospects for further nuclear reactor construction in Spain. 
During his meeting with ESTHOFF, Arana took a phone call 
informing him that a group of anti-nuclear protesters were 
trying to penetrate Garona\'s security.  Arana attributed the 
protest to the fact that the anti-nuclear lobby was also very 
much aware of the importance of the Garona license decision 
and wanted to lay down an early marker that they would not 
countenance any GOS attempt to back away from its current 
anti-nuclear stance.  Arana said \"the Spanish are more German 
than French\" (referring to the famed stereotype of the 
anti-nuke German and the relative lack of controversy over 
nuclear energy in France) and that it would \"not be 
realistic\" to bet that Spain will resume building nuclear 
power reactors any time soon.  Referring to the fact that 
Zapatero, during his inauguration speech last spring, 
reiterated his party\'s commitment to a gradual elimination of 
nuclear power, Arana pronounced the issue of further reactor 
construction \"dead for now.\"  Barcelo summed up the debate as 
\"not dead anymore, but not yet ripe for change.\" 
 
8.  (SBU)  Arana, Barcelo and Rubio stressed the continued 
influence of U.S. nuclear developments on the sector\'s future 
in Spain.  All suggested that if the U.S. decided to resume 
nuclear reactor construction, Spain would be far more likely 
to follow suit.  CIEMAT Director General Rubio, the grand old 
man of Spain\'s nuclear energy priesthood, went even further, 
stating that the U.S. would ultimately decide whether nuclear 
fission reactors would have a long-term place in the future 
world energy mix.  He categorically asserted that if the U.S. 
resumes reactor construction, Spain would follow.  Agreeing 
that the debate was dead through 2008, Rubio said his mission 
was to keep the nuclear flame alive in Spain so that there 
would be a technological base to support a future decision to 
resume advanced reactor construction.  For this reason, Spain 
would like to participate in France\'s recently announced 
plans to construct a third-generation plus European Pressure 
Reactor (EPR) in Flamanville (Ref B). 
 
9.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Rubio, Barcelo and Arana are among the 
leading authorities in Spain on this subject.  They were 
singing off the same sheet of music (i.e., the nuclear energy 
debate is dead through at least 2008) and we believe them. 
We do not believe, however, that this issue will stay buried. 
 Kyoto and the mandatory search for a nuclear waste site (not 
to mention possible continued high oil prices) should keep 
the issue in the limelight.  But we agree with Arana that the 
Spanish are more German than French on the subject of nuclear 
energy and we doubt public opinion would sustain, at least in 
the mid-term, any dramatic reversal of Spain\'s decision to 
phase out nuclear power generation.  The potential negatives 
would far outweigh the positives, and it would simply defy 
logic for Zapatero to try to reverse his party\'s opposition 
to nuclear energy during his first term in office (in 
particular because his minority government requires the 
support of several smaller parties, many of them quite 
anti-nuclear, to get its agenda through Congress).

1.  (SBU) We spoke with Mario B. Rosso, Director General of 
the Eastern Hemisphere and Caribbean for REPSOL-YPF (Repsol) 
about Reftel A and B points. 
 
2.  (SBU) Rosso was well-prepared to handle the topic, 
explaining that the framework agreement noted in Reftel B was 
only \"investigative,\" and that several years will pass before 
any final investment decision would be made.  He said that 
Repsol \"will judge at the appropriate moment\" details 
regarding any final agreement. 
 
3.  (SBU) Rosso acknowledged that Repsol, as noted in Reftel 
A, has arranged to explore areas in the Persian Gulf, but 
that the Iranians and the media have blown the magnitude of 
the project \"immensely\" out of proportion because Repsol has 
the option to walk out of the project on \"almost any day.\" 
 
4.  (SBU) In justifying Repsol,s activities in Iran, Rosso 
said that Repsol personnel are behaving as \"good citizens\" 
He also alluded to a point he underscored in our December 
2003 meeting with him (see Reftel C) in which he informed us 
that US oil companies were negotiating in Libya, preparing 
for the day when they operate there.  During that 2003 
meeting, Rosso asserted that Repsol must prepare to compete 
with US companies when the US doors open to Libya.  During 
our latest meeting with Rosso, he said \"who knows in two 
years what might happen?\"  As with Libya in 2003, he feels 
that he must prepare for future US competition in Iran. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Comment:  As always, Rosso appeared to be well 
aware of the Iran Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) and that his 
company most likely will not feel any negative impact from 
this law.  He is keenly aware of the competitive nature of 
his industry, and anticipates that US companies will compete 
fiercely with Repsol in Iran upon any future lifting of ILSA 
sanctions pertaining to Iran.

SUBJECT: JAILED ETA LEADERS CALL FOR END TO ARMED STRUGGLE 
 
 
1. (U) Summary.  Six jailed ETA members signed a letter 
addressed to the ETA leadership calling for an end to the 
armed struggle in favor of political action in cooperation 
with leftist parties.  The letter, which was evidently not 
intended for public release but found its way to a regional 
newspaper, was written by high-ranking ETA inmates several 
months before the October arrest of two top ETA leaders in 
France.  The banned ETA front group \"Batasuna\" suggested the 
letter did not represent the genuine views of jailed ETA 
leaders and there are no indications that ETA or Batasuna 
plan to renounce violence in response to the document. GOS 
authorities and political parties pointed to the letter as an 
indicator of ETA\'s weakness, but emphasized the need for 
continued vigilance and further police action against ETA. 
End Summary. 
 
//THE LETTER// 
 
2. (U) On 11/2, Spanish newspapers released excerpts of a 
letter to the ETA leadership from six jailed ETA members 
lamenting ETA\'s disarray and calling for an end to the armed 
struggle. (See unofficial translation of key points in para 
7).  The authors state bluntly that \"under the current 
circumstances, the armed struggle is not working,\" in large 
part because of the highly effective \"repression\" of ETA at 
the hands of Spanish and French authorities.  Rather than 
maintain ETA\'s militancy, the inmates recommend replacing the 
use of violence with political collaboration with leftist 
political parties in the Basque Region in pursuit of 
nationalist objectives. 
 
3. (U) The letter, which was written in August and was 
evidently not intended for public release, was signed by 
Inaki Arakama Mendia (Makario), Francisco Mujika Garmendia 
(Pakito), Inaki Bilbao Beaskoetxea, Carlos Almorza Arrieta, 
Kepa Solana Arrondo, and Koldo Aparicio Benito.  The highest 
ranking signer is Garmendia, who formed part of the ETA 
cupula until 1992, when he was arrested along with other key 
ETA leaders in Bidart, France.  Other signers were among the 
second tier of ETA\'s leadership, including Arrieta, who 
directed ETA\'s infamous \"revolutionary tax\" (i.e. - 
extortion) for several years, and Mendia, who led ETA 
operations in Madrid during its most active period in the 
1980\'s and represented ETA in negotiations with the GOS in 
Algiers in the late 1980s.  Observers noted that the document 
was written even before ETA leaders Mikel Albizu and Soledad 
Iparragirre were arrested in France in early October, arrests 
which themselves led to a further cascade of detentions of 
ETA suspects in Spain. 
 
//THE REACTION// 
 
4. (U) The release of the letter to a small Navarra newspaper 
(it is not clear who provided the copy) was apparently 
intended to further demoralize ETA during one of the worst 
periods in its history.  Minister of the Interior Jose 
Antonio Alonso, though downplaying the possibility of an 
actual halt in ETA\'s terrorist activities, cited the letter 
as evidence of ETA\'s weakness.  The ruling Socialist Party 
(PSOE) and the opposition Popular Party (PP) hailed the 
letter as vindication of their decades-long efforts to 
cripple the terrorist organization, though both parties 
echoed Minister Alonso\'s cautious tone. 
 
5. (U) Reactions were more varied in the Basque Region.  The 
PP spokesman in the Basque Parliament attacked the authors of 
the letter for lacking \"any moral reflection\" and casting 
their suggestion as merely a \"strategic\" decision.  Basque 
Minister of Justice Joseba Azkarraga called on ETA\'s 
political front, the illegal Batasuna party, to heed the 
letter and formally renounce the use of violence.  Basque 
Parliamentarian Arnaldo Otegi, who speaks for Batasuna though 
not technically a representative of the banned organization, 
decried the release of the letter and called on the media to 
\"visit ETA\'s leaders in prison and see what they really 
think.\"  Batasuna is expected to release its own plan for a 
\"solution to the conflict\" within the next few weeks, a plan 
that may reportedly include the offer of a negotiated truce, 
but not a renunciation of the armed struggle.  ETA concluded 
a similar truce with Basque nationalist parties and the 
radical left Izquierda Unida (IU) in September 1998, a move 
roundly criticized by both the PSOE and PP as a concession to 
terrorists.  With respect to the ETA letter, IU leader Gaspar 
Llamazares said the time had come for Batasuna to break its 
ties with the \"failing\" ETA. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
6. (SBU) The ETA letter is a clear indicator of significant 
internal divisions within the leadership of ETA\'s 
once-formidable terrorist apparatus.  Regardless of whether 
or not the signers expressed contrition for their past 
violence, the fact that hardened leaders of the organization 
recognized the failure of the armed struggle and the 
inevitability of a political (vice military) resolution to 
the Basque Region\'s status represents a moral victory for the 
Spanish state.  It is also indicative of the more complex 
political climate for ETA within the Basque Region, in which 
the ruling Partido Nacional Vasco (PNV) is siphoning away 
nationalist support from the radicals by advocating ever 
greater autonomy from the central government through legal 
means.  Despite these positive developments, PSOE and PP 
caution is well warranted.  ETA has proven remarkably 
resilient in the past and several key leaders, including the 
notorious Josu Ternera, remain at large. 
 
//TRANSLATION OF KEY POINTS OF LETTER// 
 
7. (U) The full text of the letter is not available, but we 
have tranlated the key elements from the portions released by 
the press: 
 
- \"In the history of ETA, we have never found ourselves in 
such poor conditions... Under our current circumstances, the 
armed struggle as we wage it today does not serve its 
purpose.\" 
 
- \"You cannot base an armed struggle on the release of 
communiques and by making threats which cannot be realized. 
(An organization) cannot develop an armed struggle when it is 
so vulnerable to repression.\" 
 
- \"The inability to wage an armed struggle and the 
impossibility of accumulating sufficient force to create the 
conditions for negotiations with the central government 
requires us to reconsider the vanguard strategy we have 
followed until now... The political left believes we have no 
ability to wield decisive influence through the armed 
struggle.  (We) are totally vulnerable to repression and 
without a capacity to react, and this is a reality that must 
be discussed openly, with all the attendant consequences.\" 
 
 
- \"This is not a matter of fixing the car\'s rear view mirror 
or replacing a flat tire.  What\'s missing is the engine.  If 
we do not grab the bull by the horns, we may introduce a 
degenerative dynamic that will affect our (ultimate) 
political objectives...We must count on the institutional 
struggle and the mass struggle.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The Government of Spain is aware of all three human 
rights issues raised in reftel demarche.  The Spanish agree 
that the possible moves by Chavez supporters threaten 
democracy, human rights and civil rights in Venezuela.  The 
Zapatero government will raise these issues with Venezuelan 
president Hugo Chavez\'s during his visit to Madrid November 
22-23, a visit which Chavez insisted on making, according to 
Spanish Foreign Ministry interlocutors.  However, given 
President Zapatero\'s  desires to build dialog with Chavez, we 
do not expect him to press Chavez hard on these questions. 
End summary.

GOS To Raise Demarche Issues During Chavez Visit

2.  (C) Poloff raised reftel issues November 4 with Ernesto 
de Zulueta, the MFA\'s deputy director general for Andean 
countries.  With respect to the arrest warrants for the 
SUMATE NGO, de Zulueta said he understands the process has 
essentially been put on hold for the moment.  De Zulueta said 
further that the Spanish government plans to address this 
matter, as well as the two disturbing proposed laws we raised 
in the demarche, with Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez when 
he visits Madrid November 22-23.  According to de Zulueta, 
the GOS has discussed all three issues with its EU partners, 
but in the end, Spain decided that direct talks between the 
Zapatero and Chavez governments would be more useful than a 
public declaration by the GOS or the EU.  We emphasized the 
urgency of these matters to Zulueta and urged the Spanish 
government to raise them with the Venezuelan government 
sooner, but de Zulueta argued the Chavez visit offered the 
best opportunity to press the Venezuelans effectively. 
 
-------------------------- 
Chavez \"Insisted\" on Visit 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) De Zulueta took pains to emphasize that the GOS 
agreed to Chavez\'s visit only after lengthy, dogged 
insistence on Chavez\'s part.  \"The impetus for the meeting 
came from Chavez, not from the Government of  Spain, I can 
assure you,\" explained de Zulueta.  (In late October, FM 
Moratinos\' chief of staff told us the same -- Chavez insisted 
on coming to Madrid.)  Chavez will be traveling with a group 
of Venezuelan businessmen and women.  De Zulueta did not yet 
know who else would accompany Chavez or whether FM Perez 
would join trip.  The GOS\'s only goal for the visit will be 
to begin some form of constructive dialog with Chavez, 
something, claimed de Zulueta, that was not occurring under 
the Aznar government due to the strained relationship between 
the former Spanish president and Chavez.  The Spanish 
government has no other agenda for the meeting at this point, 
according to de Zulueta. 
 
4.  (C) De Zulueta also asserted that the Spanish government 
has no illusions about the likelihood of progress with Chavez 
-- in fact, troubling developments in Venezuela such as the 
three issues reftel demarche raised signal a weakening of 
democracy and human rights in Venezuela.  However, Zapatero 
believes Spain must at least make an attempt to build some 
sort of constructive relationship with Chavez because he won 
the August referendum and \"is the only game in town.\"  The 
opposition remains remarkably disorganized and ineffective, 
de Zulueta  noted. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (C)  De Zulueta\'s explanation of why Spain needs to open 
dialog with Chavez is nearly identical to Spain\'s reasons for 
wanting to do the same with Castro, though the Venezuela 
issue is much less contentious in Spain.  Although de Zulueta 
said Spain does not have high hopes for dialog with Chavez, 
Zapatero clearly thinks he can build bridges where Aznar 
could not or would not.  Zapatero believes his efforts to 
build a relationship with Chavez are consistent with his 
self-image as a \"man of dialog,\" a phrase he has uttered 
repeatedly since the Socialists prevailed last March.  We 
expect Zapatero government to raise the issues outlined in 
reftel demarche with Chavez during his visit in late 
November, but not to press hard, because it is highly 
unlikely Zapatero will risk turning Chavez off during the 
Madrid visit.

SUBJECT: SPANISH GOVERNMENT POLICY ON HIV/AIDS AT HOME AND 
ABROAD 
 
REF: MADRID 3835 
 
1.  Secretary of the Spanish National AIDS Plan Lourdes 
Chamorro Ramos briefed ESTHOFF November 4 on her office\'s 
domestic and international activities/priorities.  Chamorro 
Ramos, the highest ranking Spanish Government official 
focusing solely on HIV/AIDS, indicated that her office has a 
good handle on the nature of the HIV/AIDS problem in Spain 
and is adequately funded to combat it.  New HIV infection 
rates continue to decline since their 1994 peak and Chamorro 
Ramos does not believe a resurgence is likely. 
 
------------------- 
DOMESTIC PRIORITIES 
------------------- 
 
2.  Reflecting the lack of \"crisis,\" Chamorro Ramos said she 
was currently focusing on three priorities:  (A) whether to 
target prevention activities on the infected vice general 
population a la the U.S. practice; (B) how to balance the 
infected population\'s right to privacy with the national 
health system\'s need to disseminate information about 
infected individuals; and, (C) how to convince all hospitals 
to perform transplants on infected individuals (i.e., 
destroying the myth that such procedures can only be 
conducted in specialized facilities). 
 
3.  Regarding prevention activities, Chamorro Ramos indicated 
that she might be interested in sending some of her staff 
members to the U.S. to study specialized prevention programs 
that focus on infected individuals.  ESTHOFF offered to 
assist in brokering desired meetings/visits. 
 
4.  Regarding the right to privacy, Chamorro Ramos said that 
the Spanish HIV/AIDS NGO community had mounted a successful 
legal challenge to a 2001 draft law that attempted to achieve 
a proper balance between privacy and dissemination.  As a 
result, her office was building on the failed law to draft a 
new statute that would satisfy all stakeholders.  The revised 
text was currently in the consultation phase with the NGO 
community. 
 
5.  Regarding transplants, Chamorro Ramos used the example of 
liver transplants to illustrate the problem.  She said that 
there are 20 public hospitals in Spain that perform liver 
transplants, but only 10 had so far agreed to perform such 
transplants on individuals infected with the HIV virus.  She 
stressed, however, that the GOS was attempting to address 
this problem via information campaigns vice Ministerial 
coercion. 
 
------------------------ 
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES 
------------------------ 
 
6.  Chamorro Ramos openly acknowledged that Spain is not/not 
a key player in international efforts (multilateral or 
bilateral) to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide.  Spain\'s most 
significant activity is its 100 million euro donation to the 
Global AIDS fund.  This donation covers the 2003-6 period (25 
million euros each year for four years).  50 million euros 
has already been dispersed (covering 2003/4); the remaining 
50 million will be provided in 25 million increments in 2005 
and 2006.  Spain has also donated 400,000 euros to UNAIDS and 
1 million euros to the World Health Organization (which is 
earmarked for distribution by the Pan-American Health 
Organization to anti-AIDS programs in Latin America). 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  Chamorro Ramos is Spain\'s point person on HIV/AIDS both 
at home and abroad (though she stressed her office does 
not/not control the budgets of Spain\'s international HIV/AIDS 
activities).  While the nature of her position would of 
course imply a strong defense of her office\'s domestic 
activities, we believe she was not/not blowing smoke when she 
described an adequately funded national health effort that 
has a good handle on the HIV/AIDS problem in Spain.  If 
Chamorro Ramos can focus on privacy and transplant-related 
issues, that suggests to us that the malady itself is under 
control.  Several NGOs do not agree and have publicly argued 
that the government has consistently underestimated the 
gravity of the HIV/AIDS situation in Spain.  But this is 
understandable.  It is, after all, their raison d\'etre. 
However, the lack of general public controversy over HIV/AIDS 
suggests that the GOS does have this problem well under 
control.

SUBJECT: SPECIAL 301 MID-TERM REVIEW WITH COPYRIGHT 
INDUSTRIES 
 
REF: MADRID 00736 
 
1. This is an action cable.  See para. 6.1. 
 
2. Summary: Spanish copyright industry representatives said 
at a 10/29/04 DCM-hosted lunch that it was too soon to tell 
where the Zapatero government was going with respect to IP 
protection.  The majority said they had no view at this time 
whether Spain should be put on the Special 301 list next 
year.  The Business Software Alliance (BSA) representative 
said, however, that the U.S. should strongly consider putting 
Spain on the list because IP internet protection was very 
weak, i.e. internet providers (principally Telefonica) were 
not being made sufficiently responsible for protecting 
content from unauthorized downloading.  The participants 
agreed Spanish Customs should crack down on imports of blank 
CDs; that the GOS needed to make a combined public effort 
with internet providers and content companies to deal with 
internet piracy along the lines of a recent French government 
initiative; and, that Spain needed to pass implementing 
legislation for the internet treaties soon.  End Summary 
 
3. The DCM-hosted lunch included Asociacion Fonografica y 
Videografica President Antonio Guisasolo, Pedro Farre Lopez 
(SGAE), Federacion para la Proteccion de la Propriedad 
Intelectual de la Obra Audiovisual (FAP) Legal Coordinator 
Salvador Esteban, Business Software Alliance Director of 
Institutional Relations Carlos Manuel Fernandez, and FEDICINE 
Secretary General Estela Artacho.  EconCouns, Trade Policy 
 
SIPDIS 
Officer, and Econ FSN also participated. 
 
PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED 
------------------- 
 
4. Participants agreed that Spanish police continued to 
conduct an impressive number of raids against IPR pirates, 
and that local police forces especially in Madrid, Catalonia, 
and the Basque region were becoming particularly active in 
this regard.  The new penal code establishing stiffer 
penalties entered into force on October 1, 2004 so industry 
needed to wait to see what effect the new code would have. 
All five IP representatives complained about the lack of IPR 
knowledge among judges and a sense among many members of the 
judiciary that IPR offenses were trivial.  They said they did 
not see a big shift in policy with the Zapatero government. 
However, the SGAE representative said that he thought the new 
government would probably be reluctant to engage forcefully 
in this area because the \"social cost\" would be too high, 
meaning the political cost incurred by cracking down further 
on the largely immigrant \"manteros\" (street pirates), and the 
growing generation of younger people who believed downloading 
movies and music and the internet for free was   appropriate. 
 
5. Although street piracy remains a problem, internet piracy 
is fast becoming a more significant issue.  Although Spain 
has signed the WIPO internet treaties, it has not passed 
implementing legislation because the EU Copyright Directive 
(this Directive provides the legal framework for implementing 
the WIPO internet treaties) has not been implemented yet. 
According to a Ministry of Culture contact, the Ministry is 
poised to send to parliament implementing legislation, but he 
would not say when this would happen.  The BSA representative 
complained that the \"killer applications\" sold by Telefonica 
(by far and away the most important internet provider in 
Spain) allowed subscribers to download movies and music from 
the internet with ease.  He claimed that although Telefonica 
recently, for instance, started offering Apple\'s iTunes music 
for fee service, it remained unreceptive to discussions on 
how to prevent unauthorized downloading from the internet. 
Separately, a Spanish lawyer told EconOff that the 
fundamental problem was that without appropriate implementing 
legislation, peer to peer operation cannot be effectively 
prosecuted. 
 
WHAT CAN BE DONE? 
----------------- 
 
6.  There was consensus on the desirability of working on the 
following issues. 
 
1) Get Spanish Customs to track and in certain cases prevent 
the unauthorized importation of blank CDs.  Embassy in 
coordination with industry will encourage the GOS to do so. 
Embassy requests information from Customs and Border 
Protection (CPB) regarding whether it has experiences that 
might be worth sharing in this regard with Spanish Customs. 
Such information sharing/training could conceivably be done 
in partnership under the auspices of the USG\'s recently 
announced Strategy Targeting Organized Piracy. 
 
2. Encourage GOS Ministries of Finance, Commerce, Justice, 
and Interior to announce together with internet service 
providers and content providers a commitment and strategy to 
prevent unauthorized downloading from the internet.  The 
copyright industry representatives agreed that the French 
initiative in this regard announced last July was a \"model\". 
 
3. Stress the importance to the GOS of passing implementing 
legislation for the internet treaties. 
 
4. Do more to train and sensitize Spanish judges to the 
importance of IPR.  Embassy will explore what can be done 
additionally in terms of speakers and IVs.  In July this 
year,  through the Joint Vistor Program (JVP): \"U.S.-Spanish 
Judicial Cooperation\", the Embassy nominated and sent two 
Barcelona-based judges to the U.S. for exposure to the 
American IPR system.  Our understanding is that the judges 
had a succesful trip to the U.S.  Unlike in some other 
countries, many Spanish judges are receptive to participating 
in U.S. exchange programs so we will work to identify other 
judges we might potentially nominate for similar trips. 
 
5. Encourage the GOS to launch a public campaign on the 
importance of respecting intellectual property.  All 
copyright industry representatives said this was important 
because such campaigns have until now largely been conducted 
by industry.

won\'t submit assurances against a life sentence in 
Nevada. 
 
2. The press reports that the subject\'s attorney stated 
on October 15, 2004 that Berarducci is going to be 
surrendered in the next 2 weeks, that subject will be 
handed over by Interpol and that he will travel in a 
commercial flight. US Marshals in country for the 
surrender have been advised of the developments. 
 
3. Post believes that it is possible the subject will 
file a petition for a writ of a Habeas Corpus before 
being handed to US authorities on Friday, November 12, 
2004.  His new attorney is well known as an aggressive 
defense lawyer. If they make this petition, for example 
at the airport, this would require that a judge come to

SUBJECT: SPAIN ON SUPPORT FOR IRAQI SPECIAL TRIBUNAL: 
\"MAYBE AFTER IRAQI ELECTIONS\" 
 
REF: SECSTATE 240444 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick, reason 1.5 (B). 
 
1. (C) Poloff met on 11/12 with Eva Martinez of the MFA\'s 
Directorate General for the Near East to encourage Spanish 
assistance for the Iraqi Special Tribunal.  Martinez said 
Spain had received no request from the Iraqi Interim 
Authority (IIG) for assistance in preparing for the Iraqi 
Special Tribunal.  She indicated that if such a request did 
come forward, the GOS would be unlikely to act on it until 
after the Iraqi elections, explaining that the Zapatero 
Government would be reticent to support the Iraqi government 
before it had the stamp of popular approval. 
 
2. (C) However, Martinez was quick to point out that Spain 
had earmarked \"very significant\" assistance funds for Iraq\'s 
post-election government and that judicial assistance was an 
obvious area for cooperation.  Looking over the areas for 
assistance outlined by IIG DPM Salih, Martinez said she did 
not see any that would be objectionable from Spain\'s point of 
view.  She was skeptical about the possibility of sending 
experts to provide local assistance, saying the possibility 
of having a Spanish aid worker kidnapped or killed was 
\"politically unviable\" for the Socialist government. 
Martinez noted the continuing lack of security in Baghdad and 
said it was more likely the GOS would support training in 
Spain or perhaps material assistance. 
 
3. (C) Despite the GOS boundaries on aid to the IIG, Martinez 
expressed appreciation for the demarche, particularly 
information on the precise nature of Iraqi needs.  She said 
she would forward the Iraqi request to the MFA\'s 
international cooperation agency to give them a head start in 
planning for post-election assistance.  Martinez offered to 
brief poloff on reactions by others in the MFA and by Spanish 
diplomats in Baghdad to the Iraqi request. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
4. (C) Martinez\' comments on GOS unwillingness to aid the IIG 
track with what we are hearing from other interlocutors.  The 
Iraqi charge d\'affaires in Madrid told us recently that the 
GOS will not send an ambassador to Baghdad until after the 
elections, nor will it grant the Iraqi ambassador agrement 
until after the elections.  Socialist opposition to the war, 
and especially to Spanish participation in the war, formed 
the basis of their electoral victory in March and Zapatero is 
leery of any action that would seem to lend legitimacy to 
either the invasion or to the current Iraqi leadership.  The 
GOS appears to have selected the January elections as the 
political marker for establishing normal ties with Baghdad.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 11/15/2014 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, SP 
SUBJECT: SPAIN: AMBASSADOR MAKES FAREWELL CALL ON FOREIGN 
MINISTER 
 
Classified By: Ambassador George L. Argyros, reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Ambassador met with Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel 
Angel Moratinos November 10 at the Foreign Ministry for a 
farewell call.  Ambassador began by saying it was time to get 
the U.S.-Spain relationship moving forward.  Moratinos agreed 
and said Spain and the U.S. needed to start working on a 
positive agenda.  Moratinos said Spain could be helpful in 
many areas -- Spain has credibility in the Middle East and 
Latin America, for example.  Moratinos stated Zapatero wanted 
to work with President Bush to move relations forward and 
noted that the fact that President Bush had not returned 
Zapatero\'s congratulatory phone call was not playing well in 
the media.  \"We need to improve relations and a return call 
would be a good gesture on the U.S.\'s part,\" said Moratinos. 
 
2.  (C) Moratinos also stated the Zapatero government wants 
to build on the good relations the Aznar administration 
established, not tear them down.  Moratinos added, \"In this 
Ministry, you know we are not always consulted on certain 
actions taken by others,\" likely referring to recent negative 
comments about the U.S. by Minister of Defense Jose Bono. 
 
3.  (C) Moratinos said he is committed to working hard on our 
bilateral relations, and suggested some topics that could be 
brought to the forefront as visible examples of cooperation 
between our two countries.  Fore example, Spain and the U.S. 
could renew the Joint Declaration on Defense Relations signed 
by Foreign Minister Pique and Secretary Albright in January 
2001.  Another idea was to celebrate the 10-year anniversary 
of the Transatlantic Agenda between the U.S, and the EU, 
which was originally a Spanish idea. 
 
4.  (C) Moratinos offered Spain\'s help in the Middle East. 
He said he knows all of the Palestinian leadership.  In 
particular, he knows Abu Mazen well, and if Mazen is elected 
Palestinian president, Moratinos offered to serve as an 
intermediary if the U.S. wished.  On his recent visit to 
Syria, Moratinos said the sole reason he went to Syria was to 
ask the Syrians to \"behave\" with regards to the Palestinians. 
 More generally, Moratinos noted that the country with the 
most experience in the Middle East, Spain, was not invited to 
participate in the Forum for the Future to be held in Morocco 
in December.  He understood why Spain could not attend as 
part of the G-8, but said perhaps Spain could go as guests of 
the Moroccan government.  Spain has excellent relations with 
Morocco and with November 2005 being the 10-year anniversary 
of the Barcelona Process, it may be appropriate for Spain to 
be part of this group.  However, Moratinos quickly added that 
they would accept a Moroccan invitation only if the U.S. had 
no objection. 
 
5.  (C) Ambassador Argyros suggested Spain make a strong 
gesture to show its support for the return of democracy to 
Iraq.  This would not require returning Spanish troops to 
Iraq but perhaps the GOS could train a large contingent of 
Iraqi police officers in Spain and publicize it widely. 
 
6.  (C) On Latin America, Moratinos noted that Venezuela\'s 
Chavez would be visiting Spain November 22-23.  Moratinos 
asked if the U.S. wanted to convey a message to Chavez. 
Ambassador asked Moratinos to raise the increasing drug 
trafficking problem in Venezuela  -- more and more shipments 
bound for Europe and the U.S. appear to be departing from 
Venezuela.  Moratinos welcomed a non-paper if we wanted to 
submit one. 
 
7.  (C) With respect to Afghanistan, Ambassador noted we had 
heard the Spanish ambassador to NATO has raised the 
possibility that Spain would be willing to staff a Provincial 
Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Afghanistan.  Moratinos was 
aware of the idea but said no decision had been made yet.  He 
noted it was not \"totally unrealistic\" Spain would 
participate in a PRT. 
 
8.  (C) The meeting ended with Moratinos informing the 
Ambassador he would be traveling to the U.S. early in 2005 to 
do \"outreach work\" with think tanks and government officials, 
and hoped to get an assessment of how Spain is thought about 
in the U.S.

1. (U)  This is an action message.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
2. (S)  Poloffs delivered non-paper providing additional 
information on Telstar on November 10 to the Spanish Foreign 
Ministry\'s director general for international economic 
relations, Javier Hergueta.  Hergueta said Telstar is willing 
to cooperate fully with the USG to have sanctions removed. 
He expressed concern, however, that the report was 
inaccurate.  He explained that Telstar did sell the freeze 
dryer and spare parts to Iran.  However, according to 
Hergueta, the transaction occurred in January 2003 (not 
January 2004 as stated in the non-paper) before the Iranian 
end-user was known as Exir Pharmaceuticals and before the EU 
passed legislation that defined the transferred equipment as 
dual use goods subject to export licensing restrictions. 
Hergueta reiterated Telstar\'s willingness to halt future 
transfers of its goods to Iran, and to otherwise cooperate as 
necessary to have the USG sanctions removed.  He proposed to 
set up a meeting between Emboffs, MFA officials, and Telstar 
representatives to discuss this case in greater detail. 
 
3.  (S) Action request:  Embassy understands this case is 
being discussed between NP and Spanish embassy officials in 
Washington for possible review by an interagency group.   We 
seek Department\'s guidance as to whether a meeting in Madrid 
between Emboffs, MFA officials and Telstar is desirable.  End

opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest

website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible

1.  (C)  Spain supports Turkish EU candidacy, a policy that 
has remained consistent through both the Popular Party 
administration of Jose Maria Aznar and the current Socialist 
administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.  MFA EU 
Correspondent Luis Canovas del Castillo told Poloff November 
15 that Spain has always seen Turkey\'s entry into the EU as a 
positive development.  The EU has been expanding northward 
and eastward, and the GOS would welcome balance in EU 
expansion with another Mediterranean voice.  Enrique Mora 
Benavente, MFA Head of EU Policy Planning, told Poloff that 
while other states may say they support Turkey\'s entrance 
into the EU and offer only tepid support, Spain strongly 
supports Turkey\'s candidacy. 
 
2.  (C)  Although the current government of Spain favors 
Turkish accession to the EU, the issue is not its highest EU 
priority.  Canovas believes that questions concerning Turkish 
accession talks may be frozen until the EU Constitution has 
passed in several nations.  A strong and functioning European 
Commission is also a priority of many EU member states. 
Canovas said he would not be surprised if either Cyprus or 
Greece added conditions to Turkish accession, such as the 
settlement of the Cyprus problem as a condition of entry. 
 
3.  (C)  COMMENT:  Spain supports Turkish entry into the EU 
and would vote in favor of Turkish accession today.  The GOS 
does not appear wedded to any particular timetable for 
Turkish accession and could be influenced by considerations 
from other EU members.  Targeted U.S. actions would unlikely 
change Spain\'s position, as they are already in favor of 
Turkish entry into the EU, but Spain\'s major EU allies, 
France and Germany, could possibly influence Spain\'s thinking 
towards any particular timetable for Turkish accession.  END

1.  SUMMARY: Vice President and Minister of Economy Pedro 
Solbes Mira presented the Socialist government\'s first 
General State budget to Congress on 30 September.  After 
passing the Chamber of Deputies, the budget has been 
forwarded to the Senate for debate and approval.  It will 
then be returned to the Chamber of Deputies for final 
approval.  The budget reflects annual spending of 
approximately EUR 250 billion (USD 325 billion), an increase 
of 7.8% over the 2004 amount, and its surplus equals .1% of 
Spain\'s GDP.  The two main objectives of the budget are 
increased social spending and increased productivity.  The 
programs with the highest spending increases in Solbes\' 
budget are: unemployment; civil research and development 
(R&D); affordable housing; and social security.  Programs 
with decreased spending include: military R&D; subsidized 
transportation; and miscellaneous economic programs.  The 
Solbes budget faces many challenges prior to approval, 
including an uncertain economic environment, the rising cost 
of petroleum, and tough negotiations with other political 
parties.  END SUMMARY. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
 
2.  Vice President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes Mira 
presented the Socialist government\'s first General State 
budget to Congress on 30 September.  Solbes\' stated goal is 
budgetary stability while promoting productivity and 
increasing social spending.  His budget reflects a projected 
income of approximately EUR 252 billion (USD 327.6 billion), 
an increase of 7.7% over the 2004 amount, and annual spending 
of approximately EUR 250 billion (USD 325 billion), an 
increase of 7.8% over the 2004 amount.  The resulting 
proposed budget surplus equals .1% of Spain\'s GDP and can 
primarily be attributed to social security tax income. 
 
APPROVAL PROCESS 
---------------- 
 
3.  Spanish law requires approval of the budget from both 
houses of Congress prior to implementation.  Solbes\' budget 
has been debated within the Chamber of Deputies and various 
amendments have been proposed, with one costly R&D amendment 
approved to date.  At this time, the budget has been 
forwarded to the Senate for its debate and approval process. 
The Senate should send the budget back to the Chamber of 
Deputies during the week of December 21st for final approval. 
 If the budget proceeds through both houses of Congress 
according to the government\'s schedule, it should receive 
final approval during the last week of December.  If the 
budget is not approved by the end of the year, the spending 
limits outlined in the 2004 budget will be carried over into 
2005. 
 
WINNERS 
------- 
 
4.  A primary focus of the proposed budget is increased 
productivity.  The proposed budget increases spending in the 
following areas: investment in infrastructure (up 9.1%); 
investment in civil R&D, which will double over the next four 
years (up 25.4% in 2005); and education (up 6%).  The second 
focus of the proposed budget is social programs, with social 
spending increasing 9.5% and totaling slightly more than half 
of government spending.  Key line items include: affordable 
housing programs (up 32.5%); unemployment (up 14.4%); social 
security (up 45.1%); and an increased allowance for pensions. 
 
LOSERS 
------ 
 
5.  The programs experiencing the greatest decreases in net 
spending include: miscellaneous economic programs (-1.1%); 
military R&D (-3.1%); and subsidized transportation (-12.7%). 
(Note: in the budget, the government takes on the debt of 
RENFE, the national train corporation.  Although 
transportation will receive less money in the budget, all of 
its funding will go towards operational expenses as it no 
longer needs to make debt payments, thereby keeping 
government\'s pledge to develop infrastructure.) 
 
ECONOMIC CONTEXT 
---------------- 
 
6.  Solbes\' budget is based upon a predicted 3% economic 
growth rate, an interest rate of 2% and petroleum costs of 
$37 per barrel.  Most Spanish economists describe this 
economic scenario as optimistic at the least.  Local 
economists envision a less robust level of economic growth of 
around 2% and most predict a rise in interest rates in the 
near term, which may affect consumption.  Lower economic 
growth rates will reduce government income and may cause a 
substantial gap between revenue and spending.  Finally, 
petroleum costs are currently well above the budget\'s 
projected rate and could lead to a further consumption effect. 
 
POLITICAL CONTEXT 
----------------- 
 
7.  Politically, Zapatero\'s government is a minority 
government requiring support of smaller regional parties to 
pass legislation through the lower house.  To pass the 
Senate, which can only delay legislation, support of all 
minority parties is needed.  The opposition Popular Party has 
criticized the government for bringing the budget to Congress 
without agreements already arranged.  Costly amendments have 
already been added in areas like research and development. 
The government is currently negotiating with regional parties 
to prevent further delays and amendments from political 
parties seeking concessions in return for their support. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  As the first budget of the Zapatero government, the 2005 
budget is a crucial piece of legislation.  Failure to pass 
the budget in a timely manner, or with serious controversy, 
would be a major embarrassment for both VP Solbes and PM 
Zapatero.  It could also prevent the minority government from 
delivering on key campaign promises.  The main challenge is 
whether the budget will escape Congress with most of the key 
goals intact.  Budgetary concessions to political parties 
would compromise its fiscal soundness.  The subsequent 
challenge is whether the economy will meet projected growth 
levels and provide the revenue necessary to meet budgetary 
needs.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, SP 
SUBJECT: ANDALUSIA BALANCES BUDGET WITH GOS AND EU HELP 
 
REF: A. MADRID 4385 
     B. MADRID 3715 
 
1. Summary: The Andalusian budget which was presented to the 
regional Parliament the final week of October contains EUR 
24.5 billion (USD 31.7 billion) in outlays, an increase of 
10% over 2004.  Andalusia has already received the funds 
necessary to pay for its budget expenditures from the central 
government and EU, paying only 50% of expenditures from tax 
income.  Shortly after winning the March 14 elections, the 
Socialist government in Madrid assumed the Socialist regional 
government of Andalusia\'s outstanding debt, ensuring that the 
Andalusian region would be supportive during national budget 
negotiations.  End Summary. 
 
2. EconOff and Econ Analyst met October 28 with Andalusian 
regional Secretary of Economy Antonio J. Avila Cano to 
discuss the Andalusian budget for 2005 and find out if the 
Andalusian government would be pressing for more handouts 
during the national budget debates.  According to Avila, the 
balanced budget presented to the regional parliament projects 
EUR 24.5 billion (USD 31.7 billion) in expenditures, and 
increases overall spending by 10%.  Andalusia\'s robust 
economy is expected to grow by 7% (compared with 2-3% 
nationally).  Roughly 20% of the total will be spent on 
public investment and 80% on current programs. 
 
Investment 
---------- 
 
3. The Andalusian budget for 2005 calls for spending 
increases of 8% in current programs and 24% in public 
investment.  The regional government is particularly proud of 
the planned increases in investment.  The investment line 
item includes budgetary increases of: 30.5% in R&D, 45% in 
infrastructure, 20% for universities and 56% on environmental 
projects.  Key infrastructure projects include an extension 
of the AVE high speed train to Granada and Malaga, a new 
cross-regional highway, a second terminal for Malaga airport 
and mass transit projects in Seville, Granada, Malaga and 
Cadiz. 
 
Half of Funding from Transfers 
------------------------------ 
 
4. Even with recent growth, Andalusia remains one of Spain\'s 
poorer autonomous regions, and continues to receive 
significant budgetary funding from central government and EU 
sources.  Only 40% of Andalusia\'s tax budget outlay is paid 
for by tax income collected by the tax authorities in 
Andalusia, and 10% from taxes levied directly by Andalusia. 
Direct transfers from the central government account for 30% 
of regional income, and EU transfers for infrastructure 
supply 10% of the budget.  The final 10% of income comes from 
transfers from various agreements between the Andalusian 
government and individual ministries. (Note: Andalusia\'s per 
capita GDP of 69.4% of the EU average qualifies for EU 
structural funds.  Once Andalusia\'s per capita income reaches 
75%, predicted in 2008, it will lose this funding.  An 
additional benefit Andalusia recently received from the 
national government was a payment of it\'s regional debt of 
EUR 2.5 billion (USD 3.24 billion) that accumulated between 
1997 and 2001 when the Socialist regional government did not 
accept the national Popular Party government\'s regional 
financing scheme and continued to spend more money than it 
received in transfers. 
 
5. Comment: The Andalusian government receives sufficient 
transfers from the national government and the EU to maintain 
a balanced budget.  Unlike the Catalan regional government 
(ref B), the members of parliament from Andalusia are 
unlikely to make demands on the national government that will 
effect the overall national budget debate, especially since 
the national Socialist government subsumed Andalusia\'s 
regional debt shortly after winning the March 14 elections. 
Andalusia provided the greatest number of new Socialist seats 
in Parliament, accounts for 14% of Spanish GDP and 17% of the 
population.  In the 2005 national budget, 13% of 
infrastructure investment will go to projects in Andalusia. 
The national government is keen to take care of the needs and 
wants of this most Socialist of autonomous regions.

OFFICIALS 
 
REF: (A) STATE 244943 (B) STATE 242611 
 
1.(C) Summary: GOS Treasury officials lauded cooperation with 
the U.S. on terrorism finance issues.  Within the Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF) context (see refs A and B), they 
wanted more background information on why the U.S. did not 
want to establish monitoring mechanisms to track financial 
flows of less than $3,000.  Information from Treasury on this 
would be useful in our discussions with GOS officials - 
please e-mail Carl Schonander at Schonanderce@state.gov with 
such information if it is available. End Summary 
 
2. (U) EconCouns and EconOffs met with Treasury and Financial 
Policy Director General Belen Romana Garcia and other 
Treasury officials on 11/17/04 to discuss terrorism finance 
issues.  These officials, in addition to their primary remit 
to combat money laundering, are responsible for implementing 
terrorism finance designation decisions and for developing 
policies on monitoring terrorism financial flows.  They 
reported that they had good cooperation with the U.S. within 
the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which Spain co-chairs 
with the U.S. Treasury Department\'s Daniel Glazer.  However, 
there was one area of disagreement.  The EU apparently 
believes financial flows of less than $3,000 should be 
tracked, whereas the U.S. does not because according to the 
Spaniards we do not want to impede worker remittances.  The 
GOS officials said though that they thought this issue could 
be worked out within the FATF. 
 
3. (C) EconOff briefed Belen Romana and her staff on the 
substance of the meeting between Assistant Secretary Wayne 
and Dutch Foreign Ministry Advisor Wouter Jurgens (ref A). 
They were unaware of the upcoming November 29-30 case-based 
terrorism finance workshop.  They were interested in the EU\'s 
intention to work especially with Maghreb countries and 
Indonesia to implement the FATF Special Recommendation IX on 
cash couriers.  Belen Romana said that the recommendation was 
not technically difficult to implement but would require 
political will to implement in many nations. 
 
4. (U) The GOS officials said that the implementing 
regulations for Spain\'s new terrorism finance law were still 
being drafted.  The law allows the GOS to block assets 
without UN or EU authorization.  However, fearing adverse 
litigation, the GOS has not yet used this new authority. 
Belen Romana said that when the GOS is pre-notified, her 
office takes about a week to find out what assets are being 
held by the designee(s).  She said she hoped to be able to 
obtain this information in a few days but added that, of 
course, the GOS could not actually block assets in the 
absence of a legally valid designation. 
 
5. (U) Comment: We sensed real commitment on the part of 
these highly qualified civil servants to combat terrorist 
financing.  We would certainly recommend their participation 
in appropriate terrorist financing workshops and other 
events.

REF: MADRID 4116 
 
1.  (U) This is an action request for OES/SAT and OES/STC: 
see paragraphs 5 and 6 (respectively). 
 
2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Senior Spanish Science officials continue 
to believe that France will ultimately cut a deal with Japan 
that will bring the ITER to the French site along with 
sufficient guarantees of a prominent Japanese 
construction/operation role.  A team from the Spanish Science 
Ministry would like to visit the U.S. to pitch the Canary 
Islands as a possible site for the \"Extremely Large 
Telescope\" project.  Spanish science officials believe we 
could expand and/or highlight bilateral science cooperation 
to help overcome recent bumps in the bilateral relationship 
caused by Spain\'s spring decision to withdraw its troops from 
Iraq.  Embassy Madrid stands ready to facilitate expanded 
science cooperation if there is interest from Washington 
technical agencies.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (SBU)  In a 90 minute November 12 meeting with ESTHOFF, 
Spanish General Secretary (U/S equivalent) for Science and 
Technology Policy Salvador Barbera Sandez and Director 
General (A/S equivalent) for Technology Policy Carlos 
Alejaldre Losilla pushed for expanded S and T cooperation 
with the U.S., reiterated GOS support for the six-party ITER 
framework, and requested to meet with \"key U.S. players\" on 
the Extremely Large Telescope Project to push the Canary 
Islands as a possible host site. 
 
---- 
ITER 
---- 
 
4.  (SBU) Alejaldre, the GOS point person on ITER, said he 
remained confident that France and Japan would nail down a 
deal based on the Japanese \"host/non-host\" proposal that 
would bring the ITER to France along with sufficient 
guarantees of a prominent Japanese construction/operation 
role.  He said that while the two sides were haggling about 
the \"price,\" Spain would continue to push France to cut a 
deal and leave behind any possible temptation toward pursuing 
an EU-centric ITER without Japan and the U.S.  Alejaldre said 
he would fly to Paris on November 24 for meetings with French 
officials prior to the November 25-6 meeting where a final EU 
decision may be reached.  ESTHOFF reiterated U.S. support for 
the six-party framework and encouraged Alejaldre to continue 
to push the French to come to terms with Japan. 
 
------------------------- 
EXTREMELY LARGE TELESCOPE 
------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Alejaldre said the Extremely Large Telescope 
Project \"had the potential to turn into another ITER.\" 
(Note:  We presume he meant a possible counterproductive 
pissing contest between an EU candidate site and other 
possible locations.  End Note.)  As a result, Alejaldre would 
like to lead a delegation of Spanish S and T officials to the 
U.S. to lay out Madrid\'s case for installing the Extremely 
Large Telescope in Spain (most likely on the Canary Islands). 
 Alejaldre would like to meet and brief the \"key U.S. 
players\" on this issue.  He recognized that the U.S. might 
have its own candidate site but thought it would be useful to 
lay Spain\'s cards out on the table earlier rather than later. 
 ESTHOFF said he would obtain the contact details of the key 
U.S. players on this project as well as the name of an 
individual who could coordinate with Alejaldre\'s staff 
regarding a possible visit to the U.S.  Embassy requests 
OES/SAT assistance in providing a response to Alejaldre. 
Response may be emailed to ESTHOFF Ken Forder at 
forderk@state.gov. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
EXPANDED S AND T COOPERATION WITH U.S. 
-------------------------------------- 
6.  (SBU)  Barbera underscored recent bilateral tensions over 
Spain\'s spring decision to withdraw its troops from Iraq and 
argued that highlighting and/or expanding bilateral S and T 
cooperation would be one excellent way to get the 
relationship back on track.  Thinking aloud, he proposed a 
possible 2005 visit to the U.S. by the Spanish Education and 
Science Minister and/or some sort of U.S.-Spanish S and T 
symposium as two possible mechanisms to achieve that goal. 
Barbera wondered who in the USG would be an appropriate 
interlocutor to discuss such ideas.  Alejaldre suggested 
either the office of White Office Science Advisor or DOE\'s 
Office of Science.  ESTHOFF indicated he would request 
Washington guidance regarding whether there was interest in 
expanded bilateral S and T cooperation at this time, and if 
so, who might spearhead such an effort on the Washington side 
of the equation.  Embassy requests OES/STC assistance in 
providing a response to Barbera.  Response may be emailed to 
ESTHOFF Ken Forder at forderk@state.gov. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Good news on ITER (if it is true).  As reported in 
reftel, Spain continues to have a burr under its butt about 
France beating it out as the EU ITER candidate site and thus 
offers us opportunities to triangulate on this issue 
vis-a-vis Paris.  We strongly recommend that appropriate U.S. 
authorities receive Alejaldre and his team to discuss Spain\'s 
pitch for the Extremely Large Telescope Project.  Even if we 
have our own site in mind, we could at a minimum use the 
visit to glean interesting information regarding EU 
intentions.  Barbera has clearly energized his minions to 
press ESTHOFF for a general effort to expand S and T 
cooperation.  ESTHOFF has recently heard the same message 
from many others who work both under and alongside Barbera on 
these issues.  The constant theme is that we need to 
highlight good news in the bilateral relationship and S and T 
cooperation offers an attractive way to do so.  Whether we 
want to do this at this time has clear policy implications. 
Should appropriate Washington authorities be interested in 
any effort to either highlight or expand S and T cooperation, 
Embassy Madrid would appreciate the contact details of 
someone who could honcho the required inter-agency process on 
the Washington end.

Spain\'s participation in the second round of presidential 
election in the Ukraine set for November 21 and to hear GOS 
views on imposing visa restrictions on Ukrainian officials

because Spain is party to the Schengen visa agreements, it

 Molina said that Spain would likely support the original

response it had received to its own CUE request.  She noted 
that Spanish strawberry growers had encountered problems in 
finding effective substitutes to Methyl Bromide.  This had 
led to Madrid\'s CUE request and Spanish sympathy for other

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, SP 
SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S FAREWELL LUNCH WITH ECONOMY MINISTER 
SOLBES 
 
 
1.  Summary.  During a farewell lunch with the Ambassador, 
Second Vice President and Minister of the Economy Pedro 
Solbes gave a tour d\'horizon of the status of the 2005 
budget, current and projected growth rates for the economy, 
government plans to ease the overheated housing market, and 
his take on the strengthening of the Euro against the dollar. 
 On the housing market, he floated the idea of a sort of 
\"owner\'s insurance\" to bring more of the vacant rental stock 
onto the market.  End Summary. 
 
2.  Minister Solbes noted that he was planning to return to 
Parliament immediately after the lunch in order to see the 
vote on the budget and all proposed amendments by the lower 
house.  He anticipated no difficulties in the lower house 
vote.  (Note:  The budget was approved by the Chamber of 
Deputies November 18. End note.)  The budget then goes to the 
Senate for consideration.  Solbes is anticipating difficulty 
in getting the budget through the Senate, and believes there 
is a real possibility the Popular Party and a Catalan 
nationalist party will group together to ensure the budget 
does not pass.  He noted that even if the budget was rejected 
by the Senate, it would return to the lower house and could 
be (and would be) passed by the Chamber of Deputies over the 
Senate veto.  This would not be ideal, of course, and would 
cost the PSOE government political capital in the Senate. 
 
3.  Minister Solbes noted the \"flash\" statistics for the 
third quarter of 2004 indicate overall economic growth of 2.6 
percent.  The fourth quarter should show similar figures and 
he expects overall growth for 2004 to come in at 2.6 or 2.7 
percent.  He was much cagier in projecting growth for 2005, 
tied in part to the fortunes of Spain\'s major trading 
partners in Europe.  He did say that optimists project 2.8 
percent growth and the pessimists around 2.5-2.6 percent for 
2005. 
 
4.  Solbes was fairly sanguine about the valuation of the 
Euro against the dollar.  He noted that 70 percent of Spain\'s 
trade was with Euro zone partners and so Spain is feeling 
less immediate pressure than some other Euro zone countries 
that export more heavily to the United States.  He noted, 
however, that softening demand from Germany and other Spanish 
trading partners because of their own export woes will 
eventually affect the Spanish bottom line.  He believes the 
Euro will continue to rise against the dollar until one or 
the other of the parties takes action. 
 
5.  The Ambassador queried Minister Solbes about government 
plans to ease the overheated housing market throughout Spain. 
 Low interest rates on mortgages coupled with low returns on 
other investment possibilities have led to heavy demand for 
real estate, steep increases in property values, and in 
increased mortgage indebtedness of Spaniards.  Solbes 
indicated he expects interest rates to rise in 2005, although 
incrementally and not enough to crash the market. 
 
6.  Solbes said one area the government would like to affect 
is improving the rental market.  Owner/tenant laws favor the 
tenant and a great deal of rental stock stays off the market. 
 Solbes said he was looking for a way to provide rent 
insurance for owners and to shift eviction and collection 
responsibility to the insurer.  He seemed to be trying out 
the idea and did not say whether the insurance would be 
provided by the private sector, a  public/private 
partnership, or the government.  The Ambassador noted that it 
might be simpler for owners to take action against defaulting 
tenants and evict or recover debts.  Both agreed that 
bringing the potential rental stock into the market, 
especially in Madrid and Barcelona, would effectively slow 
the house purchase market.  The idea, however, showed the 
government may be willing to take a creative (and potentially 
expensive) approach to a difficult problem. 
 
7.  Comment:  Minister Solbes was relaxed and open in his 
comments.  Given recent events, it was a conversation 
refreshingly empty of references to Iraq, U.S.-Spanish 
relations, and even the recent U.S. elections.  Solbes is 
confident of passing the PSOE government\'s first budget 
reasonably intact, which would be a political victory for the 
man brought into Zapatero\'s government to reassure those 
worried that a Socialist victory would mean an end to fiscal 
responsibility.  Although recent local rumors have indicated 
Solbes\' health was poor and he might leave the government 
sooner rather than later, he appeared in fine fettle.

1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  Poloff discussed the Middle East Peace 
Process, China, Kosovo, Belarus, Cyprus, ESDP issues, Iran, 
and Ukraine with MFA Deputy EU Correspondent Luis Canovas del 
Castillo on November 18.  Poloff also discussed Spain\'s views 
on Turkey with Juan Aristegui, MFA Subdirector General on EU 
Issues, on October 18.  Spain believes that there is 
currently an opportunity to explore Middle East peace options 
that focus around a two-state solution.  Spain\'s views on the 
Chinese Arms Embargo, Kosovo, and Cyprus remain unchanged. 
Spain and the EU share U.S. concerns over Belarus\'s human 
rights abuses and election problems.  Spain favors Turkish 
entry into the EU and believes accession talks should start 
without delay.  Spain favors increased cooperation between 
the EU and NATO.  Spain and other EU nations are likely to 
reward Iran for foresaking nuclear enrichment.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
------------------------- 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS 
------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Spain believes that there is currently a moment to 
push forward new ideas to promote peace in the Middle East. 
With a newly elected U.S. administration, Israel\'s possible 
pull-out from Gaza, and new leadership on the Palestinian 
side, there is now a chance to work towards peace.  Spain is 
a strong proponent of EU security affairs chief Javier 
Solana\'s proposal to keep alive a two-state solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Spain particularly favors 
elements of the plan that include the supporting of funding 
for elections, more security on the ground, and financial 
assistance to the Palestinians. 
 
----- 
CHINA 
----- 
 
3.  (C)  Spain continues to support a lifting of the Chinese 
Arms Embargo with a Code of Conduct. 
 
------ 
KOSOVO 
------ 
 
4.  (C)  Canovas said that Kosovo was not on the agenda for 
the GAERC meetings, but the EU supports efforts of the 
Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) Soren 
Jessen-Petersen to transfer additional competencies to the 
Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) to build 
capacity and help them meet standards. 
 
------- 
BELARUS 
------- 
 
5.  (C)  Spain and the EU share the U.S.\'s concerns about the 
human rights situation in Belarus.  Aleksandr Lukashenka 
leads an authoritarian regime whose goal is to perpetuate 
power.  At the GAERC meetings, the EU will likely ratify 
conclusions of an EU report that condemns the Lukashenka 
regime.  Additionally, the EU could possibly impose sanctions 
on Belarus. 
 
------ 
CYPRUS 
------ 
 
6.  (C)  Spain\'s position within the EU is unchanged on aid 
and trade to North Cyprus.  Spain supports efforts to assist 
North Cyprus with direct aid and increased trade and 
cooperation. 
 
------ 
TURKEY 
------ 
 
7.  (C)  Spain has always favored Turkish entry into the EU. 
Aristegui told Poloff that Spain believes that Turkish 
accession talks should start without delay in 2005, but that 
Spain will try to work for an EU consensus and achieve a date 
for accession talks that is the best for Turkey\'s candidacy. 
EU members are awaiting the European Parliaments\' first draft 
report on Turkey\'s ability to meet EU political criteria. 
According to Aristegui, this report could go against earlier 
recommendations of the European Commission that had been more 
optimistic about when Turkey might enter the EU. 
----------- 
ESDP ISSUES 
----------- 
 
8.  (C)  Spain favors increased cooperation between the EU 
and NATO and respects the Berlin-Plus arrangements.  The EU 
and NATO have worked well together in areas of the former 
Yugoslavia.  Spain will form its own Battlegroup and is ready 
to cooperate with other allies. 
 
 
OTHER ISSUES 
 
---- 
IRAN 
---- 
9.  (C)  EU member states will likely discuss Iran at the 
GAERC meetings.  Spain believes that EU states should show 
more willingness to cooperate and trade with Iran after its 
recent gesture to stop nuclear enrichment. 
 
------- 
UKRAINE 
------- 
 
10.  C)  The EU hopes for clean and fair elections in the 
Ukraine.  Regardless of who wins the election, Spain will 
carry on a dialogue with the Ukrainian government, as Ukraine 
is an EU neighbor of strategic importance (Ref B).

poloff reiterated these with MFA EU officials.  Both 
indicated that the GOS\'s policy had not changed:  the GOS 
favors eventual lifting of the arms embargo under conditions 
of an improved human rights climate in China, and with a 
strengthened EU code of conduct.  MFA officials indicated 
that at the December 8 EU-China summit or at the December 17 
EU Council meeting, any such positive statement would refer 
to eventual lifting of the embargo on condition of improved 
human rights practices.  MFA noted that the current

SUBJECT: MEETING ON WITH DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER ON IRAQ,

REF: STATE 236268 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick; reason 1.5 (B) an

1. (C) Summary.  Deputy Defense Minister Francisco Pardo told 
Charge that the MOD will take the lead in promoting 
\"excellent\" bilateral ties between Spain and the U.S. 
Regarding the tender for the S-80 submarine weapons system, 
Pardo indicated a GOS decision would be forthcoming soon.  He 
strongly implied that the GOS was leaning towards awarding 
the contract to one of the two U.S. bidders, but made clear 
that the MOD,s decision was not yet final.  On Iraq, Charge 
pressed the GOS to support common funding for the NATO 
training mission and to allow Spanish officers assigned to 
NATO commands to deploy to Iraq (REFTEL).  Pardo stressed 
continuing GOS political sensitivities over Iraq, making 
clear that the Zapatero administration would be very leery of 
the deployment of Spanish forces to Iraq under any rubric. 
This tracks with what we have heard from Chief of Defense 
General Sanz and MOD Director General for Policy Admiral 
Torrente (the number three MOD official) in recent meetings. 
Pardo was slightly more flexible with respect to additional 
Spanish troop commitments to Afghanistan, saying no increases 
were contemplated but that the GOS could \"study\" new 
proposals. 
 
2. (C) This meeting confirms reports that the GOS hopes to 
use defense issues to smooth relations with the USG.  This 
bodes well for our core defense interest in Spain ) 
continued unimpeded access to Spanish military bases. 
However, on political lightning rods such as Iraq, we see 
little chance of progress with the GOS, at least until the 
Iraq elections.  In Afghanistan, Spain won,t lead a PRT but 
they might be convinced to participate in one.  End Summary. 
 
//MOD WANTS TO PROMOTE STRONG TIES WITH USG// 
 
3. (C) Deputy Defense Minister Pardo met with Charge on 11/22 
accompanied by his chief of staff Jose Pablo Sabrido 
Fernandez and technical advisor General Juan Martin Villalon. 
 Charge was accompanied by Political Counselor, Defense 
Attache, ODC, and poloff.  Pardo led off by expressing the 
Zapatero Government,s desire for improved relations with the 
USG, \"relations that can only be good, very good, or 
excellent.\"  He noted that, contrary to speculation in the 
press and by the opposition that Zapatero would be weak on 
defense issues, the Socialists have proven even stronger on 
defense than their Popular Party predecessors, submitting a 
request for a 4.2 percent increase in the defense budget for 
2005.  Pardo insisted that media claims of anti-American 
sentiments within the GOS were without foundation.  He said 
the MOD was strongly in favor or close relations with the USG 
and would do what it could to cement bonds of friendship. 
Charge welcomed Pardo\'s comments and said the USG stands 
ready to improve bilateral relations. 
 
//S-80 SUBMARINES: CLOSE TO A DECISION// 
 
4. (C) The Charge raised the matter of the long-awaited GOS 
decision on the contract for weapons systems for Spain,s two 
S-80 submarines.  Pardo said the GOS was close to making a 
final decision, though he would not be pinned down on a 
specific timeframe  He said he understood the desire of both 
U.S. companies to get a rapid decision and, while he noted 
that there could be only one winner, he said that the USG 
likely would be \"pleased\" by the Spanish decision. (NOTE: 
Other defense sources have told us a decision would be 
announced within weeks, perhaps in early December.  Pardo,s 
forward-leaning comments are a positive sign, but we cannot 
be certain that either U.S. company will be awarded the 
contract.  END NOTE.) 
 
//IRAQ AND NATO// 
 
5. (C) The Charge said the USG understands that the Zapatero 
administration will not be budged on the issue of deploying 
Spanish troops to Iraq, but requested Spanish flexibility on 
the issues of NATO funding and the participation in Iraq of 
Spanish forces assigned to NATO commands.  Charge said it was 
our understanding that Spain had lifted its block on the use 
of common NATO funds for housing construction to support the 
NATO mission in Iraq, but that Spain, along with Belgium, 
Germany, and France continued to block common funding of the 
APODS.  He underscored the importance to the USG, NATO, and 
the international community in general of a successful 
rebuilding effort in Iraq.  Pardo said he was not aware of 
the details of the debate in the NAC regarding the use of 
common funds, but would endeavor to find out.  He assured the 
Charge that Spain,s position was technical in nature and not 
due to political concerns. 
 
6. (C) However, on the matter of deploying Spanish officers 
assigned to NATO commands, Pardo said political 
considerations were the key factor underlying Spanish 
concerns.  He said the Iraq issue remained \"polemic\" in Spain 
and that the GOS was under strong public pressure to renounce 
the deployment of any Spanish forces to Iraq, regardless of 
whether they were sent by Madrid or by NATO headquarters.  He 
asked for USG understanding of the political sensitivities 
involved.  Asked whether the MOD, like the Spanish MFA, saw 
Iraq,s January elections as a possible turning point that 
would permit greater Spanish activism, Pardo was 
noncommittal.  Pardo said, however, the GOS was looking for 
\"flexibility\" on the issue of  lifting the caveat on Spanish 
members of NATO commands to participate in the NATO training 
mission (NOTE:  MOD number three, Admiral Torrente, told 
Polcouns Nov. 18 that the GOS would prefer not to be among 
the first from NATO commands to be deployed to Iraq. END 
NOTE). 
 
//AFGHANISTAN// 
 
7. (C) Charge said Spain and the USG should be proud of 
having worked with others in the international community to 
liberate Afghanistan from the Taliban.  He thanked Pardo for 
Spain\'s participation thus far and said we would be looking 
to Madrid for additional commitments and hoped that Spain 
would make a decision on its participation in a PRT prior to 
the Force Generation Conference in Brussels next week.  Pardo 
said that Spain was pleased with the role it had played in 
Afghanistan, but cautioned that the GOS did not contemplate 
additional deployments or new missions there.  He said that 
in the Spanish political context, any deployment was 
potentially controversial and would require close 
consultations with Parliament. He said, though (also 
reflecting comments by Torrente) that the issue was still 
open regarding additional deployments or new missions such as 
a PRT. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
8. (C) This meeting confirms other indications that the GOS 
hopes to use defense issues to smooth relations with the USG, 
friction that has left them open to opposition criticism that 
Zapatero is mishandling one of Spain\'s key relationships. 
Pardo is a good interlocutor and gave every indication of his 
readiness to engage in a positive manner.   This bodes well 
for our core defense interest in Spain ) continued unimpeded 
access to Spanish military bases.  However, on political 
lightning rods such as Iraq, we see little chance of progress 
with the GOS, at least until the Iraq elections.  In 
Afghanistan, meanwhile, Spain probably won\'t lead a PRT but 
they might be convinced to participate in one.

SUBJECT: MFA CLAIMS SURPRISE AT CUBA\'S NORMALIZATION OF TIES 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick; reason 1.5 (B) an 
d (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  MFA DG for Latin America Sandomingo told 
Polcouns that the GOS had been surprised by the Cuban 
Government announcement that it would resume official 
contacts with the Spanish Embassy in Havana after more than 
17 months of having \"frozen\" such ties.  Sandomingo cast the 
move as a Castro effort to divide the EU over Cuba policy. 
While reiterating Spain\'s commitment to the EU Common 
Position on Cuba, Sandomingo predicted that Spain would soon 
gain EU consensus for eliminating the policy of inviting 
dissidents to EU national day events.  He discussed Spain\'s 
alternatives to national day invitations, insisting that EU 
contact with dissidents would increase rather than decrease 
under the Spanish plan.  We are skeptical that the GOS did 
not know in advance of Castro\'s move, as well as of 
protestations that the GOS is acting in the best interests of 
the Cuban opposition.  FM Moratinos and Socialist officials, 
rather than MFA professionals, seem to be driving a GOS 
policy towards Cuba that appears more focused on breaking 
with Aznar\'s policies than with achieving progress on human 
rights issues.  We recommend continued USG action behind the 
scenes to block Spanish efforts to weaken EU measures against 
Cuba, as well as a call from WHA A/S Noriega to DG Sandomingo 
to emphasize the depth of USG concern with respect to the 
direction of Spain\'s Cuba policy.  End Summary. 
 
//END OF THE CUBAN DEEP FREEZE// 
 
2. (U) Spanish dailies provided extensive coverage of the 
Cuban Government\'s 11/25 announcement re-establishing normal 
contacts between the GOC and Spanish diplomats in Havana, 
ties \"frozen\" by the GOC in 2003 in the wake of the EU\'s 
imposition of \"Restrictive Measures\" on Cuba.  The Cuban 
action was widely interpreted as an acknowledgement of the 
Zapatero Government\'s efforts to end the EU policy of 
inviting dissidents to EU national day events.  Opposition 
Popular Party officials suggested that the GOC move was 
simply an effort to divide the EU and to disrupt 
transatlantic ties.  Socialist Parliamentary spokesman 
Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba discarded the possibility of any 
impact on U.S.-Spain ties, saying it was \"compatible to have 
good relations with the U.S. while maintaining Spain\'s own 
foreign policy identity.\" 
 
//MFA CLAIMS SURPRISE AT CUBAN ANNOUNCEMENT// 
 
3. (C) Polcouns and poloff met with MFA Director General for 
Latin America Javier Sandomingo on 11/26 to discuss the Cuban 
announcement.  Sandomingo acknowledged the basic facts, 
saying GOC Foreign Minister Perez Roque had summoned Spanish 
Ambassador in Havana Carlos Saldivar to inform him that the 
GOC would resume normal official contacts with the Spanish 
Embassy after more than 17 months of having refused such 
contacts with most EU embassies.  Sandomingo said the GOS had 
asked Perez Roque not to announce the reopening of official 
links, but that the GOS had unilaterally decided to publicize 
its decision.  Sandomingo spoke with EU counterparts to 
reassure them that this development came solely at the 
initiative of the GOC and not as a result of Spanish-Cuban 
deal organized outside of EU channels. 
 
4. (C) Sandomingo said he did not know why the GOC had acted 
now, but ventured that Castro could have been trying to 
foment disunity within the EU, \"which he did not manage to 
do.\"  He was unsure whether Spain would respond to Cuba\'s 
public announcement, other than the brief \"clarification\" 
already issued by the GOS stating Spain\'s objective as 
normalization between Cuba and all EU countries, not just 
between Cuba and Spain.  Asked whether he viewed the Cuban 
announcement as an effort to influence the EU COLAT 
discussions on the EU\'s \"Restrictive Measures\" on Cuba, 
Sandomingo allowed that that might be the case, but insisted 
that even without Cuba\'s announcement Spain had expected to 
gain EU consensus for easing the measures by January 2005. 
He was encouraged by the fact that none of the main Cuban 
exile groups had \"reacted badly\" to the announcement of 
normalized ties and had only called on the GOS to undertake 
actions they intended to pursue anyway, such as continued 
pressure on the GOC on human rights issues.

5. (C) Sandomingo reiterated Spain\'s commitment to the EU 
Common Position on Cuba.  He said he was convinced that 
Spain\'s plan for increased contacts with Cuban opposition 
figures would be even more problematic for the GOC than the 
current EU policy of inviting dissidents to national day 
events.  He said the Spanish plan calls for a structured EU 
dialogue with the opposition that would include monthly 
meetings between EU diplomats and dissidents, biannual 
meetings between dissidents and EU ambassadors, and regular 
invitations to activists to visit EU countries.  Spain\'s 
eventual objective is to reopen its cultural center in 
Havana, which he described as Spain\'s \"most significant 
contribution to Cuban civil society.\" 
 
6. (C) Poloff pointed out that EU diplomats already meet 
regularly with dissidents and that the creation of a formal, 
structured dialogue would not be sufficient to offset the 
blow to the activists\' morale as a result of being disinvited 
from the national day events.  Polcouns suggested that a 
better alternative would be both the continuation of 
invitations to national day events and the initiation of a 
formal dialogue between the EU and the democratic opposition. 
 Sandomingo agreed on the need for the EU to recognize 
activists as legitimate political figures, but said that GOC 
antagonism towards including them in national day events was 
a barrier to potentially useful relations between the EU and 
Cuba.  The EU could have \"improved\" contacts with dissidents 
in other venues. 
 
//CUBA MOVING THE GOALPOSTS// 
 
7. (C) Poloff noted that the Polish Embassy had already 
explored this purportedly less conflictual alternative by 
hosting a reception for a broad range of Cuban civil society 
figures on a date other than its national day.  Rather than 
ignoring the event, the GOC threatened to PNG the Polish 
Ambassador if he ever hosted such a reception again. 
Sandomingo was familiar with the Polish episode and said that 
Cuban FM Perez Roque had tried a similar tack with FM 
Moratinos during the Ibero American Summit in San Jose. 
After having told Moratinos in May that the main irritant for 
the GOC was the invitation of dissidents to national day 
events, Perez Roque now claimed that a structured EU dialogue 
with the opposition would also be viewed very poorly by the 
Castro regime.  According to Sandomingo, Moratinos told Perez 
Roque bluntly that the issue was not negotiable and that the 
structured dialogue was the only viable alternative to 
inviting dissidents to national day events.  Sandomingo said 
it would be up to Castro to decide whether to PNG EU 
diplomats or \"freeze\" relations again in response to 
continued EU activism on human rights. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
8. (C) The GOC announcement may have been embarrassing for 
the GOS, but Spain has clearly been angling for a positive 
signal from Havana in order to increase Spanish leverage in 
EU negotiations over the Restrictive Measures.  We find it 
difficult to believe that nobody in the GOS was aware of 
Cuba\'s intention to \"reward\" Zapatero for his break with 
Aznar\'s Cuba policies.  The course of events and our 
conversations with GOS officials suggest that FM Moratinos, 
Socialist Party insiders, and the Spanish Ambassador in 
Havana are driving Cuba policy far more than MFA officials 
such as Sandomingo.  Unfortunately, our experience suggests 
Moratinos and other Socialist leaders are more concerned with 
burnishing their leftist (and anti-Aznar) credentials than 
with establishing a credible policy intended to promote 
Cuba\'s democratic transition.  In our view, we should work 
behind the scenes with receptive EU governments to block 
Spain\'s efforts to water down the EU Restrictive Measures 
since alternative plans are unlikely to outweigh the symbolic 
damage caused by the end of invitations to national day 
events.  We also note the Socialist Parliamentarian\'s claim 
that Spain\'s search for rapprochement with Havana has not 
affected U.S.-Spain relations.  A call from A/S Noriega to DG 
Sandomingo may help remind the GOS that Washington is closely 
(and perhaps skeptically) watching Spain\'s shifting policy 
towards Cuba.

SUBJECT: SPANISH OFFICIALS CANNOT ATTEND MEETING IN THE 
HAGUE ON CWC HOST COUNTRY AGREEMENTS 
 
REF: MADRID 4373 
 
Classified By: KATHLEEN M. FITZPATRICK, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. 
REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Spanish officials have indicated that they 
will now be unable to attend discussion on the host country 
agreement (HCA) on the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) as 
previously promised because it conflicts with other arms 
control meetings that they are scheduled to attend during the 
November 29-December 3 Conference on State Parties (CSP) in 
The Hague.  According to an official in Office of Disarmament 
Affairs at the Spanish MFA, the GOS would not be able to 
discuss amendments to the CWC with USG officials until 
mid-December.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Poloff received a call on November 24 from Luis 
Gomez, chief of staff in the Spanish MFA\'s office of 
International Disarmament Affairs, who explained that he and 
the office\'s deputy director Marcos Rodriguez would be 
participating in a conference on the Ottawa Landmines 
Convention in Nairobi instead of The Hague CSP conference. 
Ministry of Defense official Jose Quedevo Ruiz was scheduled 
to attend a conference on the PSI in Helsinki, and the 
National Authority for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 
technical advisor Nieves Gomez also had scheduling conflicts 
that prevented her from attending the Hague meeting.  He 
added that officials from Spain\'s mission to The Hague could 
not pursue discussions with USG officials on Spain\'s HCA 
without GOS officials from Madrid. 
 
3.  (C) Gomez assured Poloff that the MFA continues to 
consider discussions on the Chemical Weapons Convention a 
priority.  He explained that the scheduling conflicts and the 
commitments to other arms control meetings had caused the 
Spanish delegation members to reverse their decision to 
attend discussions on Spain\'s host country agreement at The 
Hague conference.  Gomez offered no additional details on 
whether the MFA plans to amend the most recent version of the 
CWC and said further discussions with USG officials would 
have to be delayed until mid-December.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ASEC 
SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR COLLOCATION WAIVER FOR FAS OFFICES - 
MISSION MADRID 
 
REF: 12 FAH-5 H-300 
 
1.  (SBU) In accordance with guidance provided in reference, 
Mission Spain RSO submits this formal request for a 
collocation waiver for the critically needed Foreign 
Agricultural Service (FAS) offices.  This new lease space is 
required and has been prompted by RSO concern for the 
existing building\'s negative street setback, and the 
subsequent OIG Inspection emphasizing the same concerns as 
formal recommendations. 
 
2.  (SBU) EXEMPTION CATEGORIES: 
 
Under 12 FAH-5 H-312, the exemption that pertains to the 
inability to provide for FAS collocation within the Chancery 
is category number 5, \"offices or activities which require 
space in excess of available and suitable chancery space.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) EXEMPTION CRITERIA: 
 
A - Post management, including the Chief of Mission and the 
RSO concurs on the need for and selection of this new 
facility and the need for a collocation waiver. 
 
B - FAS has addressed the issue and their headquarters and 
on-site management all concur. 
 
C - The number of direct-hire U.S. citizens assigned to the 
FAS office is commensurate with the staffing requirements and 
manpower authorizations to properly support the office and 
its activities. 
 
D - All applicable required physical security standards will 
be met prior to occupancy. 
 
4.  (SBU) EXEMPTION NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES: 
 
A - POST/OFFICE INVOLVED - American Embassy Madrid, Foreign 
Agricultural Service. 
 
B - LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION - The building is located 
approximately three block from the existing Chancery at Pinar 
6, on the second floor of a seven 
Floor building.  According to GSO a Spanish national, Maria 
Pilar Prado, owns property.  The building is standard Spanish 
construction described by the Embassy Facilities Office as 
poured concrete, reinforced with rebar.  There are no steel 
beams installed, in that, this is not a standard office 
building, rather an apartment building retrofitted to house 
both residences and offices. 
 
The proposed office space is located on the interior of the 
building with no windows facing the street.  There is 
approximately 100 feet of set back on the back side of the 
building but much less on the front faade that sits on a 
public street.  It has an underground 
parking garage that has access control systems in the form of 
garage door openers for occupants of the building. 
 
The windows are non-laminated glass and there is one 
stairwell for egress that ends at the lobby. 
 
Access control to the building is by occupant owned keys and 
a doorman who works intermittent hours during the day and 
evening.  There is no fire alarm system throughout the 
building. 
 
C - EXEMPTION CATEGORY/REASONS - See above. 
 
D - SUPPORTING CONCURRENCE DOCUMENTATION - The Mission/FAS 
cable supportive of this request will follow SEPTEL, 
referencing this cable. 
 
E - PHYSICAL SECURITY STANDARDS FOR OCCUPANCY - See above. A 
comprehensive Physical Security Survey will follow via SEPTEL. 
 
F - USE/STORAGE OF CLASSIFIED MATERIAL - No classified 
material will be handled, processed, discussed or stored in 
this facility in accordance with OSPB security standards. 
 
5.  (U)  EXCEPTION  REQUEST PROCEDURES 
 
Standard Involved: 
 
Post requests a waiver and exception for setback for the 
proposed FAS Office Space. 
 
Justification: 
Typical preexisting construction in metropolitan Madrid does 
not provide setback of 100 feet.  Additionally, the office 
space FAS is considering is located on the interior of the 
building offering improved protection to occupants and 
visitors to the office. 
 
Statement of agency operation requirements; 
FAS Madrid is requesting the exception/waiver for their new 
commercial office space.  A cable from FAS HQ has been 
requested and FAS Madrid ensures post that funding will be 
provided for all RSO required physical security upgrades. 
FAS Madrid further ensures that they will 
not occupy the new office space until all physical security 
upgrades have been completed, and 
they understand that the waiver/exception will not be granted 
until receipt of written concurrence from 
FAS HQ. 
 
Survey Report: Will be sent via pouch and will include 
description of building, city map, neighborhood map, property 
plot plan, proposed office space layout, permits (if 
applicable), photographs, and COM and RSO statements and 
recommendations.

opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest

SUBJECT: SPAIN/CUBA:  REVIEW REGARDING SUSPENSION OF TITLE 
III OF THE LIBERTAD ACT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 248337 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick; reasons 1.5 (B) a 
nd (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Spain is among the most important foreign 
investors in Cuba and the ruling Socialist party has 
continued the Popular Party\'s policy of encouraging further 
investment and trade with Cuba.  On human rights issues, the 
GOS has broken with the Aznar administration\'s emphasis on 
support for democracy activists in favor of seeking greater 
dialogue with the Castro regime.  Within the EU, Spain has 
led the effort to end the EU policy of inviting dissidents to 
EU national day events, calling the invitations a major 
impediment to normal contact with the Cuban authorities. 
Despite our displeasure over the direction of Spanish policy 
towards Cuba, we should consider whether it is in our 
interest to deepen our divisions with the EU over Cuba by 
authorizing Title III actions against Spanish entities, given 
EU countries\' tendency to defer to Spain on Cuba issues. 
Madrid considers itself a bridge between Cuba and the EU and 
has emphasized this purported role to overcome the objections 
of countries that insist on a strong, principled EU position 
on Cuba.  Even EU countries that have resisted Spanish 
efforts to weaken EU positions on Cuba may feel compelled to 
support an EU partner faced with U.S. legal action.  End 
Summary. 
 
//SPAIN SEEKS TO EASE EU \"RESTRICTIVE MEASURES\" ON CUBA// 
 
2. (C) As a member of the EU, Spain is a party to the EU 
Common Position on Cuba, which guides EU diplomatic relations 
with Cuba and links improved bilateral relations to an 
improvement in Cuba\'s human rights record.  Spanish officials 
have repeatedly stated their commitment to the Common 
Position.  However, over the last six months, and in 
particular since September, the GOS officials have emphasized 
their rejection of Aznar\'s activism on behalf of Cuban 
opposition figures and have advocated the \"modification\" of 
the EU\'s \"Restrictive Measures\" against Cuba.  Madrid\'s 
primary objective is to end the policy of inviting Cuban 
opposition figures to EU national day celebrations, which the 
GOS cites as the main obstacle to normal diplomatic ties. 
The GOS asserts that normal diplomatic relations would enable 
the GOS to positively influence Cuban officials and would not 
preclude robust relations with dissidents. 
 
3. (C) We strongly disagree with GOS efforts to weaken the EU 
Restrictive Measures and believe we should do whatever 
possible to block Madrid\'s initiative within the EU.  Spanish 
officials have responded to our criticism of their actions on 
the Restrictive Measures by stating their intention to 
promote continued, and even increased contacts with Cuban 
opposition figures.  In public statements on Cuba, both 
President Zapatero and FM Moratinos have stressed the need 
for the GOC to institute democratic reforms as a precondition 
for greater support for Cuba by the EU.  Spain\'s latitude on 
Cuba is hemmed in by EU partners, such as the Czech Republic, 
that reject weakening EU measures and instead support a 
strong, principled stand in support of pro-democracy 
activists.  This political landscape would probably shift to 
our disadvantage in the event of legal action against a 
Spanish company under Title III. 
 
4. (C) Regardless of the government in power, Spain plays a 
leading role on Cuba issues within the EU.  Under Aznar, 
Spain was a key player in solidifying EU support for a 
strong, principled defense of human rights issues (even as 
his government pursued continued Spanish investment in Cuba 
and opposed the U.S. embargo).  With the shift in Spain\'s 
Cuba policy under Zapatero, we still see EU countries 
deferring to Spain on Cuba policy, though this time in a 
negative direction.  The GOS understands its leverage on Cuba 
within the EU and, if Title III action were taken against a 
Spanish company, it would seek to rally its EU partners to 
its defense, and perhaps even undermine broader EU support 
for the Common Position.  Countries that have resisted 
Madrid\'s attempts to water down EU policy towards Cuba could 
feel undermined by a USG decision to permit legal action 
against Spanish companies. 
 
//MAJOR SPANISH INVESTMENTS IN CUBA// 
 
5. (U) Spanish businesses are well aware of the potential of 
U.S. legal action against them under the Libertad Act and 
take care to obscure precise invormation regarding their 
investments in Cuba.  However, we have obtained the following 
general information regarding the major Spanish investors in 
Cuba: 
 
-- Grupo Sol Melia: Hotel/Tourism industry.  Locations in 
Cuba include Havana, Varadero, Cayo Largo, Cayo Santa Maria, 
Ciego de Avila, Cayo Largo del Sur, Cayo Guillermo, Playa 
Esmeralda, and Santiago de Cuba.  The total investment amount 
is unknown, but press reports indicate Sol Melia will invest 
USD 50 million in two hotels in 2004-2005. 
 
-- Inversiones Ibersuizas: Commercial investment firm. 
Investments in Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba.  According to 
press reports, Inversiones Ibersuizas has invested a total of 
USD 150 million in various Cuban projects.

in Havana and Play Yuraguanal.  Investment amount unknown.

SUBJECT: VIRTUAL PRESENCE PROGRAM (VPP) IN 
SEVILLE/ANDALUSIA INITIATED 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary  Embassy Madrid has decided to initiate 
Virtual Presence Programs (VPP) for Andalusia and the Basque 
country a one year trial basis.  Charge initiated the 
Andalusia VPP concept while visiting Seville November 
30-December 1.  He hosted a well attended reception for the 
U.S. Davis Cup tennis team and local officials.  The tennis 
team is captained by Patrick McEnroe and includes the world 
number two ranked player:  Andy Roddick.  The U.S. team will 
compete with the Spanish team in the Davis Cup final in 
Seville December 3-5.  Charge\'s visit generated extensive 
press coverage-he got the message out that while we have 
differences, Spain and the U.S. con continue to work together 
on important issues, including security matters.  Charge met 
with Autonomous Community of Andalusia President Manuel 
Chavez Gonzalez, a nationally influential PSOE stalwart. 
(Note:  In Spain, \"Autonomous Communities\" are roughly 
equivalent to states in the U.S., although Spain is formally 
still a unitary country).  Chavez reiterated the PSOE 
position that Spain wants to be \"useful,\" for instance in the 
Middle East, to the U.S., although he prefaced his remarks by 
saying he does not speak for the GOS.  Charge also met with a 
representative for the Mayor of Seville.  Both Chavez and the 
Mayor\'s representative welcomed the prospect of a continuing 
dialogue with the U.S. Embassy through the Virtual Presence 
Program.  End Summary. 
 
WHY VIRTUAL PRESENCE IN ANDALUSIA 
 
2.  (U)  We closed our Consulate General in Seville fifteen 
years ago, but we still maintain a two person Consular Agency 
in Seville.  There are numerous reasons to make an effort to 
maintain an ongoing dialogue with the regional and city 
governments.  Andalusia is big with seven million out of 
Spain\'s 40 million inhabitants.  The PSOE leadership is 
nationally influential.  Andalusia is home to many American 
retirees and hosts many tourists.  We have two important 
military bases there.  See Para. 3 for a non-exhaustive list 
of our ongoing interests and activities in Andalusia.  Our 
idea is to use this list as a basis for developing additional 
programs and activities serving Mission Program Plan (MPP) 
goals.  Trade Policy Officer Carl Schonander is the Embassy\'s 
Andalusia Virtual Program Coordinator.  He will be liaisoning 
on an ongoing basis with regional and city officials 
regarding ways we might expand activities in and with 
Andalusia. 
 
UNITED STATES PRESENCE/ACTIVITIES IN SEVILLE AND ANDALUSIA 
 
3.  (U)  Consular Agency to remain; Rota and Moron bases. 
Container Security Initiative in Algeciras.  U.S.-Spain 
Council 10th Annual Meeting probably in February, 2005 
(chaired by Senator Chris Dodd and Antonio Garrigues).

academic exchanges called \"Building Bridges\"; sponsor 
speakers for Universidad de Jaen Spring 2005 Spanish 
Association of American Studies biannual program; assist 
Malaga Centro de Arte Contemporaneo put together an exhibit 
by American artist Alex Katz in February-June 2005. 
Researchers from Andalusia have received Fulbright 
scholarships; some U.S. Fulbright scholars perform research 
in Andalusia. International Visitor Program: Intensified 
effort to find qualified candidates from Andalusia. United 
States Commercial Service (USCS)/Confederacion Empresarios 
Andaluses (CEA) seminar in 2005. U.S. Embassy Environment, 
Science and Technology Officer to explore possibility of 
greater Science & Technology cooperation with Andalusia, as 
well as greater Andalusian presence in the Fulbright grant 
process. Annual visit by American Consul General. Political 
Section visits in 2005 especially oriented towards 
identifying and providing counterterrorism training to 
members of local law enforcement agencies. Seville maintains 
a sister city relationship with Kansas City. 
 
NOVEMBER 30 RECEPTION A SUCCESS 
 
4. (U) The first Embassy-hosted reception in Seville in four 
years proved successful with the Mayor in attendance and top 
lieutenants to the President of the Autonomous Community of 
Andalusia.  The hook of the U.S. Davis Cup tennis team\'s 
presence generated excitement. The Davis Cup final, a three 
day event, has attracted sold out crowds in Seville and is 
one of the most important sporting events the city has 
hosted.  The U.S. reception attracted national,regional, 
local, and TV media.  Charge\'s subsequent TV and press 
interviews also received widespread positive coverage. 
 
 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT OF ANDALUSIA AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY 
MANUEL CHAVEZ GONZALEZ 
 
5. (SBU) Chavez is a heavyweight within the PSOE.  Had he 
been willing to leave Andalusia, he would have been a strong 
contender for the PSOE leadership.  He is nationally 
influential and travels frequently in Spain and abroad. 
Chavez was receptive to closer contacts with the Embassy in 
Madrid.  He was very interested in the upcoming U.S.-Spain 
Council meeting, provisionally scheduled for February 2005 in 
Seville.  He reiterated the PSOE line that Spain wants to be 
\"useful\" to the U.S., although he prefaced his remarks by 
saying that he does not speak for the GOS.  He said that Iraq 
was an \"accident\" in U.S.-Spanish relations and that the two 
countries should return to \"normality.8 Chavez said he grew 
up with Americans from the military bases in Andalusia.  He 
noted that he had been selected twice for International 
Visitor programs.  The first time he could not go because the 
Franco government stopped him.  The second time he went in 
the late seventies, and he said it had been a good 
experience.  Chavez opined that Catalonia was medium-term a 
more significant problem for Spain\'s constitutional future 
than the Basque country despite the terrorism problem in the 
latter.  He said the Catalonia PSOE was more nationalist than 
socialist, whereas the Basque PSOE was more socialist than 
nationalist. (Comment: A fundamental problem for leaders of 
autonomous communities like Andalusia that are comfortable 
with a Spanish identity is that if Catalonia and the Basque 
country demand and receive more powers, the other communities 
often feel duty-bound to demand the same concessions from the 
central government.  There is resistance in Spain to the idea 
that some communities should effectively be more equal than 
others such as Quebec is in the Canadian Confederation and 
Scotland in the United Kingdom).  Chavez mentioned that he is 
currently reading Bob Woodward\'s \"Plan of Attack,8 and that 
he found the book\'s description of decision making at the 
highest level of the USG \"interesting.8 
 
MEETING WITH SEVILLE ADJUNCT PRESIDENT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
RELATIONS ALFONSO SEOANE YARZA 
 
6. (U) Seoane mentioned that he had just returned from a trip 
to Tangiers.  He said that Spanish businesses were 
potentially interested in investing in Morocco to take 
advantage of the U.S.-Morocco FTA.  He noted that some 
Spanish businesses really were suffering from the Euro-Dollar 
exchange rate, and that they needed to do everything possible 
to increase competitiveness.  Seoane reiterated that the City 
of Seville would like to see the U.S. use the Consular Agency 
building more often.  Charge noted that the building was too 
large for U.S. needs, and that we would probably return the 
building to the City when our lease expires in February 2006, 
although a final USG decision has not been made.  Seoane was 
very interested in expanding student exchange programs.  He 
also mentioned that baseball was becoming more popular, and 
that he would like to try to arrange a game between an 
Andalusian team and a team from the Rota naval base.  Seoane 
mentioned that Seville\'s top female soccer player (Seville 
plays in the A feminine league) is an American called 
Jennifer Talavera-she gets a lot of attention in the local 
press. 
 
COMMENT 
 
7. (U) Charge\'s trip to Seville proved a good launching pad 
for the Virtual Presence Program in Andalusia.

1.  (C) SUMMARY: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez visited 
Spain November 21-23, in a trip that was touted by the 
Spanish government as primarily economic in nature.  Chavez 
commenced his stay by stating that good relations with Spain 
\"have become of strategic importance\" and that he \"welcomes 
the new course\" of the Spanish government.  Chavez also made 
three economic announcements, which concerned petroleum 
production and possible contracts for Izar, the troubled 
Spanish shipbuilder.  During Chavez\'s visit, Spanish Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos stated during a television 
interview that the previous Aznar government had supported 
the 2002 coup against Chavez in cooperation with the US 
government.  Moratinos\' statements led to the Partido Popular 
(PP) calling for his resignation and threatening to break off 
cooperation with the Zapatero government.  Chavez departed 
November 23, continuing on a tour that included stops in 
Libya, Russia, Iran and Qatar, but returned on November 30 
for a private dinner with King Juan Carlos.  In the Spanish 
Congress December 1, Moratinos said that he had not meant to 
indicate the Aznar government was involved in the coup 
attempt; rather, that the Aznar government should have 
condemned the attempt and did not do so.  Moratinos did not 
mention the U.S. in his appearance, except to refer to 
Washington having joined in the OAS\'s condemnation of the 
coup attempt.  While Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardino Leon 
told Charge November 29 that the Zapatero government had 
firmly conveyed the messages to Chavez that the Secretary had 
suggested to Moratinos in their phone call, MFA Director 
General for Latin American Affairs Sandomingo told us that 
Chavez had not responded substantively to these messages. 
Sandomingo indicated that these issues arose during Chavez\'s 
meeting with Moratinos, and that the Zapatero meeting was 
mainly ceremonial, and focused on economic issues.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
//COURTING THE SOCIALISTS// 
 
2.  (U) Chavez arrived in Spain on November 21, greeted by 
about 200 supporters.  During a memorial service for the 
victims of the March 11 train bombings, Chavez gave a speech 
in which he stated that stronger relations with Spain \"have 
become of strategic importance\" and that he \"welcomes the new 
course\" of the Spanish government.  On November 22, Chavez 
began his day by delivering an anti-imperialism speech at a 
local university.  He criticized the foreign policy of the 
previous Aznar government stating, \"It was sad that Spain was 
subordinate to Washington and how nice it is to now see a 
free, happy and independent Spain with new ideas.\" Chavez 
also stated that the US \"appeared to be predestined to plague 
America with misery in the name of liberty\" and said, \"we 
reject the war in Iraq, we reject any type of attack, we 
reject the sanctions against Cuba and any kind of threat to 
the people of Iran.\"  After his speech, Chavez met with the 
President of the Chamber of Deputies Manuel Marin, and then 
with Zapatero. That evening, Chavez attended a social 
gathering with left-wing artists, politicians and journalists 
during which he publicly praised Cuban leader Fidel Castro 
and Argentinean President Nestor Kirchner.  On November 23, 
Chavez attended a meeting with Defense Minister Jose Bono, 
which resulted in a general agreement on increased military 
cooperation between the two countries with details to be 
determined at a later date. 
 
//ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS// 
 
3.  (U) In 2003, Spanish exports to Venezuela fell 48 
percent, from EUR 616mil (800.8mil USD) to EUR 320mil (416mil 
USD), while imports from Venezuela dropped 58 percent. 
Chavez had been expected to announce the formation of the 
first ever joint venture company in the Venezuelan oil 
industry, but negotiations did not conclude before his trip. 
The venture, which includes state-owned Petroleos de 
Venezuela (PDVSA) and Spain\'s largest oil firm Repsol-YPF, 
will aim to improve oil and gas production in the Lake 
Maracaibo region, where both companies maintain oil fields. 
Under Venezuelan law, Repsol-YPF would be limited to 49 
percent of the joint venture company\'s capital. During his 
visit, Chavez made three significant economic announcements. 
First, that the GOV is considering giving priority to the 
Spanish shipbuilder Izar for repairing petroleum tankers.  As 
a result, it is likely that the GOV will send two tankers to 
Spain in early 2005 for repairs.  Second, Chavez announced 
that the PDVSA might contract with Izar for the construction 
of three new petroleum tankers.  The deal would be worth an 
estimated EUR 150mil (195mil USD) and would provide three 
years worth of work for Izar.  Finally, Chavez announced that 
Venezuela would not support any proposed reductions in oil 
production at the next OPEC summit.  After his meeting with 
the Zapatero, Chavez skipped a scheduled speech that was to 
be delivered to over 200 businessmen at the Spanish Chamber 
of Commerce.  In his place, Venezuelan Commerce Secretary 
Wilmar Castro addressed the group and urged them to invest in 
Venezuela.  Chavez also met with President of the Spanish 
Business Association Jose Maria Cuevas.  In his meeting with 
Chavez, Cuevas reportedly stressed that legal security and 
political stability were key to business investment in 
Venezuela.  Cuevas also reportedly stressed the importance of 
open dialogue with Venezuelan business leaders, mentioning 
the business group Federcamaras specifically.  The 
Federcamaras leader, Pedro Carmona, led the coup against 
Chavez in 2002 and is currently in exile. 
 
//SPANISH FM WEIGHS IN// 
 
4.  (U) In a related development on November 22, Spanish 
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos announced during a 
televised interview with the program 59 segundos that the 
previous Aznar government had supported the 2002 coup against 
Chavez in cooperation with the U.S. government.  Moratinos 
stated that the Foreign Ministry had sent instructions to the 
Spanish ambassador to Venezuela to support the coup and to 
participate in a joint meeting with the US ambassador and the 
Venezuelan opposition leader.  The Moratinos statement caused 
a furor in the Spanish press and has led to public 
condemnation by the opposition party, Partido Popular (PP). 
The PP called for Moratinos\' resignation and threatened to 
break off all cooperation with the Zapatero government if a 
public retraction and apology is not issued.  Zapatero and 
Chavez held a joint press conference the following day, which 
was marked by both parties\' avoidance of questions related to 
the Moratinos statement in regard to Aznar\'s support for the 
Venezuelan coup attempt in 2002.  Chavez, who has made the 
same accusation in the past, stated that it was \"a page from 
the past\" and that he would rather speak about his pleasant 
visit to Spain and business relations.  Zapatero refused to 
elaborate on Moratinos\'s statements and said that the matter 
would be explained in front of the Spanish Congress on 
December 1.  On December 1, Moratinos did appear in front of 
the Spanish Congress and stated that his remarks were not 
meant to imply that the Aznar government had instigated or 
participated in the coup, but that the government had given 
the coup international legitimacy by meeting with its leader. 
 Moratinos then apologized about his choice of words during 
the television interview, but repeated his assertion that the 
Aznar government gave international legitimacy to the coup 
attempt.  In response, the PP has stated that they will not 
meet with Moratinos to reach a pact on foreign policy as he 
has lost \"moral legitimacy\". 
 
//SUBSTANCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, OTHER KEY ISSUES?// 
 
5.  (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Bernadino Leon told Charge 
November 29 in a brief conversation that Moratinos had raised 
human rights, regional security and other issues the 
Secretary suggested he convey to Chavez.  In a meeting with 
 
SIPDIS 
Polcouns November 26, MFA Director General for Latin American 
Affairs Javier Sandomingo indicated that Chavez had little or 
no substantive comment for Moratinos on these issues, and 
that the meeting with Zapatero was largely ceremonial and 
focused on economic/commercial issues.  Leon said that 
Moratinos would try to phone the Secretary after Chavez 
return visit November 30 for dinner with King Juan Carlos. 
 
//COMMENTS// 
 
6.  (U) Negotiations between Repsol-YPF and PDVSA are 
expected to conclude within the upcoming weeks.  The deal 
could provide Spanish and EU markets cheaper access to 
petroleum and natural gas in the future.  Venezuela\'s 
announcement that they will oppose production cuts at the 
next OPEC summit should have a positive economic effect on 
the price of petroleum by soothing investor fears already 
shaken by the activity in Iraq. 
7.  (U) Izar continues to be both an economic and a political 
problem for the Spanish government.  A lack of civil 
contracts, a proposed restructuring that would separate the 
profitable military component from the struggling civil 
component, and EU pressure for the refund of illegal 
government subsidies threaten the employment of approximately 
32,000 Spanish shipyard workers, causing Zapatero\'s first 
real labor crisis.  Shipyard workers have held public 
demonstrations, some of which have resulted in scattered 
violence, in several cities.  A business deal with PDVSA 
would not be enough to save the company, but could be a good 
starting point for eventual economic stability of the civil 
component. The public announcements about future work for 
Izar are seen as Chavez\'s attempt to provide domestic 
political assistance to the Zapatero government.  However, 
the non-committal nature of Chavez\'s statements leaves doubt 
as to whether they will actually materialize. 
8.  (U) Chavez\'s failure to appear at the Chamber of Commerce 
may have a negative effect on Spanish investment in 
Venezuela.  Apparently, Spanish businesses are skeptical 
about doing business in Venezuela, especially after the 
failed 2002 coup.  The conversation between Cuevas and Chavez 
highlights this problem and Chavez\'s failure to prioritize 
business interests will not serve to soothe investors\' fears. 
 In addition, Chavez\'s political speeches against the US and 
comments in support of Zapatero and other socialists have 
some Spanish political parties worried that he may have 
worsened U.S.-Spanish relations. 
9.  (U) The biggest story to arise out of the visit was not 
Chavez\'s activities, but the political polemics that emerged 
following Moratinos\' coup support allegation.  The normally 
gregarious Chavez didn\'t comment on the statement during his 
joint press conference with Zapatero, leading many to 
speculate that Zapatero asked him to tone down the rhetoric. 
The PP has threatened to break off all negotiations with the 
Zapatero government except for those related to the fight 
against terrorism and normal institutional functions. 
Moratinos\' statements before Congress will probably have 
little effect on smoothing over the rift that has grown 
between the PP and the Zapatero government.  Due to the 
minority nature of the Zapatero government, this could lead 
to the Socialists\' inability to implement their agenda and 
also threaten Spain\'s ability to ratify the EU constitution.

SUBJECT: SPAIN BETS ON WINDPOWER 
 
REF: MADRID 4241 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Spain\'s \"new\" Socialist Party (PSOE) Government, 
unlike its center-right predecessor, appears be taking quite 
seriously the commitment, enshrined in domestic law and EU 
Directive, to derive 12 percent of energy consumption from 
renewable energy sources by 2010.  Renewable energy sources 
currently only provide 6.8 percent of Spanish energy 
consumption.  Spain believes windpower represents its most 
promising renewable energy source and hopes wind will carry 
it toward compliance with the 12/2010 target.  A quick glance 
at the numbers, and an analysis of the economics of renewable 
energy in Spain, suggests that windpower is indeed Spain\'s 
best option.  But Madrid\'s pointman on renewable energy 
believes the 12/2010 target could only be met if the growth 
of energy demand was also suppressed vis-a-vis higher energy 
prices.  He noted, however, that his proposals to increase 
energy prices had been blocked by Second Vice President and 
Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, for fear that 
higher prices would increase inflation and put Spain\'s 
macro-economic fundamentals off kilter.  Whichever way the 
energy price debate goes, renewable energy sources do not 
offer Spain a way out of its worrisome dependency on foreign 
energy supply or a magic solution to allow Madrid to 
implement its Kyoto Protocol commitments without significant 
economic dislocation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) Higher oil prices and the GOS\' decision to take its 
Kyoto Protocol commitments seriously have led to greater 
public focus on both nuclear and renewable energy sources. 
Reftel addressed prospects for a nuclear energy revival in 
Spain.  This cable focuses on the renewable side of the 
energy mix equation. 
 
------------------------- 
12 PERCENT BY 2010 TARGET 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  In December 1999, the then-ruling center-right 
Popular Party (PP) Government promulgated the Renewable 
Energies Promotion Plan (REPP).  The REPP called for Spain to 
increase the share of energy consumption met by renewable 
energy sources to the level of 12 percent by 2010.  It also 
called for renewable sources to provide 29.4 percent of 
electricity generation by 2010.  These targets were 
consistent with the EU\'s \"White Book\" on renewable energy, as 
well as EU Directive 2001/77/CE.  However, by most accounts, 
the PP made no serious effort to meet these targets, 
preferring to let markets determine Spain\'s energy mix. 
Spain\'s \"new\" PSOE Government, which was elected in March 
2004, announced that it would make serious efforts to meet 
the 12/2010 target.  The new government, under the leadership 
of Prime Minister Zapatero, underscored that expanded 
renewable energy production, combined with greater emphasis 
on energy efficiency and a reduced energy demand growth rate, 
were integral parts of Spain\'s strategy to meet its Kyoto 
Protocol commitments (another initiative that the PP paid lip 
service to, but no made no serious effort to implement). 
Indeed, the government calculates that achieving the 12/2010 
target would reduce annual Spanish CO2 emissions by over 40 
million metric tons in 2011. 
 
4.  (U)  To get a better handle on the PSOE\'s plans and level 
of commitment to renewable energy sources, ESTHOFF met 
recently with the Francisco Javier Garcia Breva, Director 
General (A/S equivalent) of the Industry Ministry\'s Institute 
for the Diversification and Savings of Energy (IDAE). 
Garcia, Spain\'s pointman on renewable energy, began with a 
general overview of renewables in Spain.  His general sales 
pitch is that a greater focus on renewable energy sources 
would:  (1) reduce dependency on foreign energy sources; (2) 
help Spain comply with its Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gas 
emissions limits; and, (3) help boost the Spanish economy (as 
Spanish industry is a world leader in wind and solar 
technologies).  Garcia said it was his job to both increase 
the supply of renewable energy and reduce overall energy 
demand (or at least reduce the growth rate of energy demand). 
 
----------------------------------- 
CURRENT ENERGY CONSUMPTION SNAPSHOT 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) According to Garcia, Spain\'s degree of external 
energy dependency (80 percent) is approximately double the EU 
average.  According to 2003 IDAE figures, 50.3 percent of 
overall Spanish energy demand is met by petroleum, 15.8 
percent by natural gas, 15.2 percent by coal, 11.9 percent by 
nuclear, and 6.8 percent by renewable sources.  Of this 6.8 
percent renewable share, 2.9 percent comes from biomass, 2.5 
percent from hydroelectric, 0.8 percent from wind, and 0.2 
percent from biogas.  All other renewable sources, including 
photovoltaic and thermal solar, represent less than 0.3 
percent of Spanish energy consumption. 
 
6.  (U) Expressed as percentages of electricity consumption 
vice overall energy consumption, coal provides 28 percent of 
Spanish electricity consumption, followed by nuclear (24 
percent), renewables (24 percent), natural gas (16 percent) 
and petroleum (eight percent).  Of the 24 percent of 
electricity consumption supplied by renewable sources, 18.5 
percent comes from hydroelectric, followed by wind (5.1 
percent) and biomass (0.6 percent). 
 
-------------------------- 
REPP TARGETS NEED REVISION 
-------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) Under the current REPP targets, Spain should generate 
35,733 megawatts (MW) of electricity from renewable sources 
by 2010.  The target breakdowns are as follows:  16,571 MW 
from hydro, 13,000 MW from wind, 2,230 from minihydro, 3,098 
from biomass, 262 from urban solid waste, 200 from 
thermoelectric solar, 144 from photovoltaic solar and 78 from 
biogas. 
 
8.  (U) Garcia underscored that both the renewed emphasis on 
actually trying to meet the 12/2010 target, as well as energy 
consumption growth rates that had exceeded those predicted in 
the REPP (the original REPP targets were based on a 2 percent 
average annual energy consumption growth rate between 
1999-2010, while the actual average annual growth rate 
between 1999-2003 has been 3.5 percent) had forced the GOS to 
reassess the original REPP targets.  Since energy demand had 
grown faster than anticipated in the REPP, Spain would need 
even more renewable production to meet the 12/2010 goal. 
Garcia estimates that renewable energy production in Spain 
would have to increase 22 percent a year between 2005-10 in 
order to meet the 12/2010 goal.  He also stressed that the 
business/technology environment in Spain had evolved since 
the targets were mandated in 1999 and they thus needed to be 
updated.  Finally, he noted that electricity generation was 
the only segment of the renewables sector that could 
realistically help Spain meet the 12/2010 target. 
 
---------------------- 
PSOE BETS ON WINDPOWER 
---------------------- 
 
9.  (U) IDAE\'s proposals to adjust to these new realities, 
which are pending the approval of Commerce, Tourism, and 
Industry Minister Montilla, represent a clear GOS bet on 
windpower to meet the REPP targets.  Under the current 
proposed/revised REPP targets, the 2010 windpower goal would 
increase from 13,000 MW to 20,000 MW.  Besides wind, the 
proposed changes would increase the solar and biofuels 
targets, while reducing the biomass target.  What is under 
discussion is not the 12/2010 target itself.  That would stay 
the same.  What would change is that windpower would emerge 
as the renewable technology of choice to meet the existing 
12/2010 target.  Indeed, some in the windpower industry are 
calling for the GOS to expand the 2010 windpower target to as 
high as 28,000 MW (which would represent 18.5 percent of 
electricity demand).  They note that over 30,000 MW of 
economically feasible windpower resources have already been 
identified.  This is not wishful thinking, as Garcia noted 
that the GOS had already authorized permits for close to 
24,000 MW of wind parks.  The final revised REPP targets are 
expected to be issued by the Commerce, Tourism and Industry 
Ministry by March 2005. 
 
10.  (U)  Garcia said windpower clearly offers the single 
best chance of meeting the revised REPP targets and more 
broadly, along with solar, represents the future of renewable 
energy in Spain.  Why wind?  Garcia offered the following 
arguments:  (1) the technology is ripe and mostly homegrown; 
(2) the economics work (i.e., it is profitable); (3) the 
regulatory framework is already in place; (4) the amount of 
unexploited wind resources offers long-term opportunities; 
and, (5) wind is the \"greenest\" of the renewable sources. 
Garcia said windpower in Spain \"was not a chimera, but a 
reality; a brilliant reality.\"   The GOS would play its part 
by continuing to renew annual agreements that guarantee that 
above market rates are paid for electricity entering the grid 
from renewable sources.  But the key driving force, Garcia 
noted, was that production costs were dropping dramatically, 
making windpower an ever more lucrative business opportunity. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
WINDPOWER IN SPAIN:  FACTS AND FIGURES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
11.  (U) As of 2003, Spain had 6,075 MW of installed 
windpower.  This represents 16 percent of total global 
installed capacity.  It is also eight times the amount of 
installed windpower existing in Spain in 1998 (when Spain had 
only six percent of global installed capacity).  The 6.075 MW 
also represents 47 percent of the current 2010 REPP target of 
13,000 MW.  In 2003, Spain was second in Europe after Germany 
and third in the world (behind Germany and the U.S.) in terms 
of installed windpower.  Spain is set to pass the U.S. and 
move into second place in installed windpower during the 
course of 2004 (8,000 MW of installed windpower by the end of 
2004 versus 15,000 MW for Germany).  Half of the wind 
turbines installed globally in 2003 were installed in either 
Spain or Germany.  During 2003 alone, installed windpower 
capacity in Spain increased by 28 percent (the global growth 
rate was 27 percent and the EU growth rate was 23 percent). 
The 2004 installed windpower growth rate for Spain has been 
estimated at 29 percent.  What all these numbers suggest is 
that windpower represents Spain\'s only realistic hope of 
meeting the 12/2010 targets. 
 
12. (U)  As for the regional breakdown of Spain\'s windpower 
resources, it is clear that the dominate region is Galicia 
(1,614 MW installed), followed by Castilla-La Mancha (986 
MW), Aragon (985 MW), Castilla y Leon (925 MW), and Navarra 
(722 MW).  These five regions house 85 percent of total 
installed windpower capacity in Spain.  Garcia said the 
development of windpower in other regions with great 
potential (i.e., Cataluna, Asturias and Cantabria) had been 
stymied by environmental opposition (mostly defenders of 
migratory bird species that perish when they fly into wind 
turbines and those who believe windmills represent a type of 
visual pollution). 
 
----------------------------------------- 
SPANISH INDUSTRY WELL-PLACED IN WINDPOWER 
----------------------------------------- 
 
13.  (U) The Spanish firm GAMESA is the world\'s third largest 
producer of wind turbines, with 17.5 percent of the global 
market in 2003.  Spanish firms produced 78 percent of the 
wind turbines installed in Spain in 2003.  Foreign firms, 
including GE (which is the world\'s second largest producer of 
wind turbines with 18 percent of the world market), installed 
the remaining 22 percent.  IDEA estimates that 350 Spanish 
firms are now involved in the windpower sector, representing 
over 81,000 jobs (20,000 direct, 61,000 indirect).  This is 
expected to grow to 200,000 jobs by 2010.  IBERDROLA, Spain\'s 
second largest electricity supplier, claims to be the world\'s 
largest generator of renewable energy, with 3,100 MW 
installed by the end of 2004 and plans to have 5,500 MW 
installed by 2008.  Garcia told ESTHOFF that China plans to 
make major windpower investments and that Spanish business 
(e.g., GAMESA) has an excellent chance of capturing a large 
part of this potentially lucrative wind turbine market. 
 
------------------------------ 
REMAINING WINDPOWER CHALLENGES 
------------------------------ 
 
14.  (U)  When asked about major impediments to windpower\'s 
continued growth in Spain, Garcia cited three items all 
related to ensuring a seamless connection of wind parks to 
the Spanish electricity grid:  (1) the need for better wind 
turbine technology to ensure electricity supply security in 
times of low winds; (2) the need for more effective 
connection of wind parks to the electricity grid; and, (3) 
the imperative to connect the Spanish electricity grid with 
the rest of Europe (e.g., France) to better stabilize the 
domestic electricity grid.  All three measures, Garcia 
stressed, would help ensure that greater reliance on 
windpower does not lead to a higher rate of electricity grid 
collapse (thus increasing the economic attractiveness of 
windparks). 
 
----------------------- 
SOLAR A LONGER-TERM BET 
----------------------- 
 
15.  (U) Garcia clearly believes that after windpower, solar 
energy has the best long-term growth potential in Spain. 
Spain, with 9.3 percent of the global market, is the EU\'s 
second largest producer of photovoltaic cells (after Germany) 
and the world\'s fourth largest producer (after Japan, the 
U.S., and Germany).  Most of Spain\'s production is exported 
to Germany (which has 10 times more installed panels than 
Spain).  To stimulate the domestic panel market, the Zapatero 
Government plans to alter Spain\'s building codes to require 
the installation of thermal solar energy panels in all new or 
renovated buildings.  The idea is for these panels to become 
the main source of sanitary hot water for all new or 
renovated buildings.  But Garcia stressed that the bet on 
solar was long-term and that neither type of solar would 
really help meet the 12/2010 target. 
 
------------------------- 
DEMAND REDUCTION ALSO KEY 
------------------------- 
 
16.  (U) Garcia underscored that the demand side of the 
equation was also key.  He said Spain needs to promote 
greater energy use efficiency while simultaneously reducing 
the growth rate of energy demand.  Expanded renewable energy 
production is far less significant if energy demand growth 
exceeds domestic energy supply growth.  To foster greater 
efficiency, the PSOE Government plans greater efforts to 
implement the 2003-12 Energy Efficiency Strategy passed by 
the former PP government in November 2003.  The building code 
changes referenced above are the first significant new 
efficiency-related measure adopted by the PSOE government. 
Garcia said others would soon follow. 
 
17.  (SBU) But the best way to reduce demand, according to 
Garcia, would be to increase energy prices (presumably via 
higher taxes).  At Garcia\'s urging, Industry Minister 
Montilla vetted such a proposal with his Cabinet colleagues. 
But the proposal was shot down by Second Vice President and 
Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, for fear that 
higher energy prices would increase inflation and put Spain\'s 
macro-economic fundamentals off kilter.  Montilla is now 
playing the loyal cabinet soldier, stating in repeated public 
remarks that he does not plan to increase energy prices 
beyond current inflation rates.  Indeed rates are expected to 
rise by only 2 percent in 2005, well below the anticipated 
2004 Spanish inflation rate of 2.8 percent. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
18.  (SBU) While hydroelectric represents by far the biggest 
source of renewable electricity generation in Spain, most 
economically feasible hydro resources have already been 
exploited and most analysts doubt hydro could make a 
significant new contribution toward meeting the 12/2010 
target.  The bet on wind appears intelligent.  Windpower is 
the fastest growing renewable energy source in Spain and the 
one with the greatest immediate potential for expansion.  The 
business community clearly sees a bright future in windpower. 
 But it is also clear that the wind boom is not the result of 
GOS sponsorship.  The real reason, not surprisingly, is that 
there is money to be made in this business.  In this regard 
and notwithstanding PSOE denials, there is not that much 
difference between the PSOE and PP renewable energy policy. 
The PSOE\'s bet on windpower is best viewed as a recognition 
of the market potential of windpower in Spain. 
 
19.  (SBU) The economic viability of solar energy in Spain, 
on the other hand, is less well established and it remains 
doubtful that solar could emerge as a significant player in 
the short to medium term.  The building code changes should 
boost domestic demand for photovoltaic panels and are a 
necessary, but probably not sufficient boost for this sector. 
 Spanish companies are well established in both the wind and 
solar markets, being world leaders in the production of both 
wind generators and photovoltaic panels.  Thus there are 
possibilities for interesting synergies. 
 
20.  (SBU) However it is important to remember that the 
renewed focus on renewable energy will not significantly 
alter Spain\'s serious dependency on foreign energy sources. 
The best solution for that larger question would probably be 
nuclear, but that remains a political taboo for now (see 
reftel).  Prospects for significant change on the demand side 
are also uncertain.  Higher energy prices seem out of the 
question (at least in the short-run) for both political and 
economic reasons, as attempting to curb demand via higher 
prices and/or other mechanisms would likely have a negative 
impact on economic growth.  Promoting better energy 
efficiency via tax incentives is probably the easiest way for 
Spain to slow the growth rate of energy demand, but this 
again would likely be a drop in the bucket and not a solution 
in itself.  What is clear is that there are no easy answers 
to the problem of how Spain can reduce its foreign energy 
dependency, stimulate renewable energy production, and meet 
Kyoto Protocol commitments while simultaneously trying to 
grow its economy.

SUBJECT: WEEKEND BOMBINGS MASK DECLINING ETA CAPABILITIES 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Bob Manzanares; reason 1.5 (B) and (D) 
. 
 
1. (C) Summary. ETA terrorists carried out twelve bombings in 
two sets of coordinated attacks during the December 3-6 
holiday weekend in Spain.  The bombs consisted of small 
devices and there were no fatalities, though 10-20 people 
sustained minor injuries.  The first series of bombings took 
place the evening of December 3 in five gas stations around 
Madrid, attacks evidently aimed at disrupting the exodus of 
holiday travelers streaming out of the city.  ETA issued a 
warning before the second set of bombings, which took place 
at 1330 local time on December 6.  Most observers are 
interpreting the attacks as an ETA show of force after months 
of dramatic reverses due to police arrests of top ETA 
militants.  These bombings notwithstanding, Basque security 
officials, politicians, and journalists from across the 
political spectrum recently told us that ETA is in a steep 
decline from which it cannot recover.  A thornier question is 
how the 130,000 militant Basque nationalists who currently 
accept ETA\'s methods can be drawn into the legitimate 
political process, and how nationalists and non-nationalists 
can co-exist in the face of radically different views on the 
Basque Region\'s political direction.  End Summary. 
 
//THE BOMBINGS// 
 
2. (U) After months of arrests of key ETA leaders and 
organizers by Spanish and French police, ETA struck back with 
two sets of simultaneous bombings in eight cities across 
Spain, including Madrid, Leon, Valladolid, Avila, Ciudad 
Real, Santillana del Mar (Cantabria), Alicante, and Malaga. 
Another explosive device was deactivated by police in Almeria 
and police responded to a false bomb threat against Popular 
Party (PP) headquarters in downtown Madrid.  The first round 
of five explosions occured on December 3 at approximately 
1700 hours at gas stations along major exit routes from 
Madrid.  The bombings were preceded by calls to the Basque 
newspaper \"Gara\" warning of the impending attacks.  The 
selection of the targets was evidently intended to disrupt 
the large number of Madrid residents leaving the city for the 
long \"Constitution Day\" weekend. 
 
3. (U) On December 6, Spanish Constitution Day, \"Gara\" again 
received a telephone call warning that explosives had been 
placed in specific locations in Valladolid, Leon, Avila, and 
Santillana del Mar.  This was followed by a second call 
warning of bombs in Alicante, Malaga, and Ciudad Real.  Most 
of the explosives had been placed in restaurants near plazas 
and tourist sites.  Police were able to evacuate potential 
victims from most of the sites, though a total of 10-20 
persons suffered minor injuries in Santillana del Mar and 
Ciudad Real.  Damage from the bombings varied, with some 
restaurants gutted by the blasts and other sites suffering 
scarcely any damage. 
 
4. (U) Police believe two separate ETA \"comandos\" (cells) 
carried out the bombings, with one cell organizing the 
Malaga, Alicante, and Ciudad Real attacks while the second 
cell placed devices in Avila, Valladolid, Leon, and 
Sanitillana del Mar.  Police are uncertain which ETA cell 
carried out the Madrid bombings.  Each of the devices 
contained approximately 300 grams of an explosive material, 
which police believe to be a substance identical to that 
typically employed by ETA.  Police sources told reporters 
that the bombs were superior to recent ETA devices and that 
similarties among them point to a single, highly-qualified 
bomb maker. 
 
//PROOF OF LIFE// 
 
5. (U) Most commentators are characterizing the attacks as a 
show of force by ETA to demonstrate that it retains a 
military and organizational capacity despite political 
setbacks and months of police arrests of top ETA militants by 
French and Spanish police.  During the year, authorities have 
arrested dozens of terrorist suspects and members of ETA\'s 
logistical support network (including ETA leader Mikel 
Antza), six jailed ETA members wrote a letter calling for an 
end to the armed conflict, and Batasuna, ETA\'s political 
wing, suggested peace talks might be possible (though 
Batasuna did not renounce ETA violence).  The Constitution 
Day attacks are interpreted as the rejection by ETA fighters 
of calls for them to lay down their arms and pursue a 
political solution.  At the same time, ETA\'s care to avoid 
fatalities, as it has for the last 18 months, is seen as an 
acknowledgement of their weak political position and the 
growing rejection of violent methods in the wake of the March 
11 train bombings and prior ETA attacks. 
 
//BASQUE OBSERVERS: ETA IN ITS FINAL PHASE// 
 
6. (C) The ETA bombings came one day after Basque Government 
officials, Basque politicians, and journalists who cover ETA 
told us that conditions in the Basque region have shifted 
against ETA and that the organization is in a state of rapid 
and irreversible decline.  Basque Government Deputy Adviser 
for Security Mikel Legarda said that over his six years in 
the Basque Interior Department Basque, Spanish, and French 
police have steadily chipped away at ETA\'s military base and 
that a definitive end to the conflict is very likely within 
the next few years.  Criticizing the uniformly tough approach 
of the Aznar government, Legarda said it was important to be 
\"practical\" in this final phase, continuing to erode ETA 
capabilities while avoiding fanning the flames of radical 
nationalism.  \"I don\'t care whether I convince them of the 
rightness my position, as long as they are convinced that the 
armed struggle has been a total failure.\" 
 
7. (C) Legarda and Basque Secretary General for External 
Affairs Inaki Aguirre told poloff that the ruling Basque 
Nationalist Party (PNV) is attempting to strangle political 
support for ETA by co-opting some of ETA\'s political 
positions.  In particular, PNV leader Ibarretxe\'s effort to 
bring about a new agreement with Madrid expanding the scope 
of Basque autonomy (Plan Ibarretxe) is directly aimed at the 
130,000 Basque voters who currently support Batasuna and, by 
implication, ETA\'s radical methods.  Legarda and Aguirre said 
tolerance for ETA violence has declined in every sector of 
the Basque nationalist camp, with the exception of this group 
of voters located mostly in Guipuzcoa province, the bastion 
of radical Basque nationalism.  The PNV believes that by 
proving it can gain greater independence from Madrid through 
legal methods it can discredit ETA among its core supporters 
and make a continuation of the armed struggle untenable.  The 
PNV expects to lose a December 30 Basque Parliament vote on 
whether to move forward with Plan Ibarretxe, a loss the PNV 
intends to use to rally nationalist support (including from 
Batasuna supporters) during Basque regional elections in May 
2005. 
 
//NON-NATIONALIST VIEWS ON ETA AND BASQUE NATIONALISM// 
 
8. (C) Non-nationalist interlocutors in the PP and the 
Socialist Party agreed with the PNV\'s analysis of declining 
popular support for ETA and with the notion that ETA is in 
its last years, but strongly disagreed with the PNV\'s 
description of the motives behind Plan Ibarretxe.  Santiago 
Abascal, a PP youth leader and member of the Basque 
Parliament, described the PNV to poloff as \"enemies, not 
political adversaries\" and insisted that Plan Ibarretxe was a 
thinly disguised effort by the PNV to solidify its political 
control over the Basque Region at the expense of other 
groupings.  Jon Juaristi, a prominent academic from a Basque 
nationalist family who has gradually shifted to 
anti-nationalist positions, said the PNV can\'t fathom the 
possibility of losing political control in the Basque Region 
and will compromise with ETA as needed in order to retain 
that control.  Juaristi asserted that the PNV and other 
nationalist groups consider ETA \"part of the family\" and, 
while genuinely against ETA violence, they are loath to see 
ETA firmly crushed by Spanish security forces.  Both Juaristi 
and Abascal have been identified as targets in ETA documents 
seized by police. 
 
//CAN A MILITANT ETA SURVIVE?// 
 
9. (C) Basque journalist and long-time ETA observer Oscar 
Beltran told poloff that he expects to \"stop having to write 
about ETA in less than five years.\"  He said that ETA 
terrorist leader Josu Ternera is near death from a medical 
condition, creating more instability at the top of the 
organization.  Beltran\'s fear is that ETA will respond as it 
has in past crises, by bringing back semi-retired cadres from 
Latin America to reconstitute the organization.  Beltran, a 
specialist on ETA relations with Latin American 
revolutionaries, said that ETA members who worked with 
Nicaragua\'s Sandinistas form a particularly skilled group 
that could reestablish order and train new members in basic 
operational methods.  Interestingly, Beltran had heard rumors 
within radical circles that with the disappearance of France 
as a safe-haven and the decline of French-language 
instruction in Basque schools, more and more ETA activists 
are establishing themselves in the United Kingdom while not 
in action.  Though ETA has the power to extend its life 
through such adaptations, Beltran ventured that nothing can 
save it from the decline in nationalist fervor in the Basque 
Country (except among core ETA supporters) coupled with 
improved effectiveness by security forces. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
10. (C) ETA is clearly in a state of decline, but the small 
group of radicals (fielding perhaps no more than 50 
operatives) continues to cast a long shadow over the Basque 
political landscape.  Conversations with various sectors 
revealed a continuing deep insecurity and mistrust among the 
different political groups, divisions based on radically 
different views of national identity and an ingrained sense 
of victimhood within all the major factions.  With the 
population nearly evenly divided between nationalists and 
non-nationalists, there is little likelihood of change in the 
political equation that has guaranteed PNV power since the 
fall of Franco, but power in the face of a strong opposition 
backed by Madrid.  The good news is that, to a greater extent 
than at any time in the last 30 years, observers are 
beginning to speak of the post-ETA era as inevitable, rather 
than a desirable, but unlikely eventuality.

essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of

SUBJECT: VIRTUAL PRESENCE PROGRAM (VPP) IN SEVILLE/ANDALUSIA INITIATED 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Embassy Madrid has decided to initiate Virtual 
Presence Programs (VPP) for Andalusia and the Basque country on 
a one year trial basis.  Charge initiated the Andalusia VPP 
concept while visiting Seville November 30 - December 1.  He 
hosted a well attended reception for the U.S. Davis Cup tennis 
team and local officials.  The tennis team is captained by 
Patrick McEnroe and includes the world number two ranked player: 
Andy Roddick.  The U.S. team will compete with the Spanish team 
in the Davis Cup final in Seville December 3-5.  Charge\'s visit 
generated extensive press coverage - he got the message out that 
while we have differences, Spain and the U.S. continue to work 
together on important issues, including security matters. 
Charge met with Autonomous Community of Andalusia President 
Manuel Chavez Gonzalez, a nationally influential PSOE stalwart. 
(Note: In Spain \"Autonomous Communities\" are roughly equivalent 
to states in the U.S., although Spain is formally still a 
unitary country.)  Chavez reiterated the PSOE position that 
Spain wants to be \"useful\", for instance in the Middle East, to 
the U.S., although he prefaced his remarks by saying he does not 
speak for the GOS.  Charge also met with a representative for 
the Mayor of Seville.  Both Chavez and the Mayor\'s 
representative welcomed the prospect of a continuing dialogue 
with the U.S. Embassy through the Virtual Presence Program. End 
Summary

WHY VIRTUAL PRESENCE IN ANDALUSIA? 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) We closed our Consulate General in Seville fifteen years 
ago, but we still maintain a two person Consular Agency in 
Seville. There are numerous reasons to make an effort to 
maintain an ongoing dialogue with the regional and city 
governments.  Andalusia is big with seven million out of Spain\'s 
40 million inhabitants.  The PSOE leadership is nationally 
influential.  Andalusia is home to many American retirees and 
hosts many tourists.  We have two important military bases 
there.  See para. 3 for a non-exhaustive list of our ongoing 
interests and activities in Andalusia.  Our idea is to use this 
list as a basis for developing additional programs and 
activities serving Mission Program Plan (MPP) goals.  Trade 
Policy Officer Carl Schonander is the Embassy\'s Andalusia 
Virtual Program Coordinator.  He will be liaising on an ongoing 
basis with regional and city officials regarding ways we might 
expand activities in and with Andalusia.

contender for the PSOE leadership.  He is nationally influential 
and travels frequently in Spain and abroad.  Chavez was 
receptive to closer contacts with the Embassy in Madrid.  He was 
very interested in the upcoming U.S.-Spain Council meeting, 
provisionally scheduled for February 2005 in Seville.  He 
reiterated the PSOE line that Spain wants to be \"useful\" to the 
U.S., although he prefaced his remarks by saying that he does 
not speak for the GOS.  He said that Iraq was an \"accident\" in 
U.S.-Spanish relations and that the two countries should return 
to \"normality\".  Chavez said he grew up with Americans from the 
military bases in Andalusia.  He noted that he had been selected 
twice for International Visitor programs.  The first time he 
could not go because the Franco government stopped him.  The 
second time he went in the late seventies, and he said it had 
been a good experience.  Chavez opined that Catalonia was medium- 
term a more significant problem for Spain\'s constitutional 
future than the Basque country despite the terrorism problem in 
the latter.  He said the Catalonia PSOE was more nationalist 
than socialist, whereas the Basque PSOE was more socialist than 
nationalist. (Comment: A fundamental problem for leaders of 
autonomous communities like Andalusia that are comfortable with 
a Spanish identity is that if Catalonia and the Basque country 
demand and receive more powers, the other communities often feel 
duty-bound to demand the same concessions from the central 
government.  There is resistance in Spain to the idea that some 
communities should effectively be more equal than others such as 
Quebec is in the Canadian Confederation and Scotland in the 
United Kingdom.)  Chavez mentioned that he is currently reading 
Bob Woodward\'s \"Plan of Attack\", and that he found the book\'s 
description of decionmaking at the highest level of the 
USG \"interesting\".

6. (U) Seoane mentioned that he had just returned from a trip to 
Tangiers.  He said that Spanish businesses were potentially 
interested in investing in Morocco to take advantage of the U.S.- 
Morocco FTA.  He noted that some Spanish businesses really were 
suffering from the Euro-Dollar exchange rate, and that they 
needed to do everything possible to increase competitiveness. 
Seoane reiterated that the City of Seville would like to see the 
U.S. use the Consular Agency building more often.  Charge noted 
that the building was too large for U.S. needs, and that we 
would probably return to the building to the City when our lease 
expires in February 2006, although a final USG decision has not 
been made.  Seoane was very interested in expanding student 
exchange programs.  He also mentioned that baseball was becoming 
more popular, and that he would like to try to arrange a game 
between an Andalusian team and a team from the Rota naval base. 
Seoane mentioned that Seville\'s top female soccer player 
(Seville plays in the A feminine league) is an American called 
Jennifer Talavera - she gets a lot of attention in the local 
press.

essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at

E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/10/2014 
TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MOPS, SP, NATO, Defense and Political 
SUBJECT: SPAIN: CHARGE MEETS WITH CHIEF OF DEFENSE 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires J. Robert Manzanares, 
reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Charge met with Spanish Chief of Defense 
General Felix Sanz December 9.  Sanz said he will do all in 
his power to strengthen U.S./Spain military ties.  He agreed 
it was not useful talk about whether the military 
relationship between the two countries is \"balanced,\" rather 
Spain\'s permission given to the U.S. to use its bases is part 
of Spain\'s contribution to global security.  He hopes the 
Spanish government will eventually agree to allow Spanish 
troops attached to NATO to go to Iraq as part of a NATO 
consensus mission to train Iraqi security forces.  He is 
optimistic Spain will help provide security for the next 
round of Afghan elections, and said chances are good Spain 
will participate in either in a Provincial Reconstruction 
Team (PRT) or the Herat Forward Support Base (FSB), but 
probably not both.  Sanz said Spain has never had a close 
military relationship with France and that is not likely to 
change under President Zapatero.  Although Sanz took pains 
during the lunch to show he is pro-American and is optimistic 
about Spain\'s participation in NATO missions in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, he is not a policy maker and is more positive 
about Spain\'s potential role in the NATO missions than is the 
Zapatero government.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) Several members of Sanz\'s staff joined him at the 
meeting, while from the embassy side defense attache, Office 
of Defense Cooperation chief and poloff also attended.  Sanz 
said he will do all he can to strengthen U.S./Spain military 
ties.  He said there is no reason U.S./Spain mil-mil 
relations should move backward and in fact, if they do not 
improve significantly while he is CHOD, he \"will consider 
that a failure\" on his part.  He suggested he and the Charge 
have monthly lunches and offered to host the next one. 
 
3.  (C) With respect to comments Sanz, Defense Minister Bono 
and others have made in the last couple of months to the 
effect that the U.S./Spain military relationship is tilted in 
the U.S.\'s favor, Sanz agreed it was not useful for either 
government to think in those terms.  Sanz believes that given 
Spain\'s limited ability to project military force, one of the 
best ways Spain can contribute to global security is by 
allowing the U.S. to use bases on Spanish soil. 
 
4.  (C)  Sanz said he hopes the GOS will eventually agree to 
send Spanish troops to Iraq who are attached to NATO as part 
of a consensus mission.  He disagrees in general with caveats 
to participation in NATO missions and thinks the Foreign 
Ministry is doing its best to convince Zapatero to eliminate 
or at least reduce national caveats to NATO missions.  In his 
words, \"You are either part of the alliance or you\'re not.\" 
He added chances are better Spain would send troops to Iraq 
as part of a NATO force after Iraqi elections, because that 
would give the Zapatero government political cover.  Sanz 
also said Spain will probably agree to train Iraqi security 
forces in Spain at its anti-mining institute. 
 
5.  (C) Turning to Afghanistan, Sanz said Spain\'s 
participation in ISAF has gone extremely well in every way. 
As a result, he is optimistic Spain will participate in 
ISAF\'s security mission for the next round of elections.  On 
Spain\'s possible role in a PRT or the Herat FSB, Sanz said 
chances are good Spain will participate in one or the other 
but not both.  It would be useful, said Sanz, if the U.S. 
could indicate to Spain which was more important from the 
U.S. point of view.  He thinks Spanish participation in the 
FSB is more attractive from Spain\'s perspective but does not 
rule out the possibility the GOS would eventually agree to 
play a role (not necessarily the lead role, but a role) in a 
PRT if the USG decides that is more important.  Sanz said he 
believes Spain\'s ambassador to NATO is working overtime to 
persuade the Zapatero government that Spain should do all it 
can in Afghanistan and in connection with the NATO training 
mission for Iraq. 
 
6.  (C) Finally, Sanz commented on Spain/France mil-mil 
relations, saying Spain has never had close military 
relations with France and he does not expect that to change 
under Zapatero.  The Spanish military is far more interested 
in maintaining close ties with the U.S.  In general, he 
thinks the French political-military outlook is evolving in a 
positive direction for NATO and for European security. 
France is realizing that its self-chosen exclusion from the 
NATO military structure has meant that it essentially does 
not speak the same language as the rest of Europe on military 
matters.  He thinks over the next several years France will 
move closer and closer to NATO\'s military structure. 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  Sanz is still smarting from having been 
quoted in the press as saying the U.S./Spain military 
relation is out of kilter in the U.S.\'s favor.  He took pains 
during the lunch to point out that he and the Spanish 
military are pro-U.S., want excellent relations with the U.S. 
and believe Spain should do all it can to assist NATO 
missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.  We think he fairly 
represented the view of the majority of the Spanish military. 
 Nonetheless, Sanz is not a policy maker and the Zapatero 
government\'s interest in inserting Spain further into ISAF\'s 
mission in Afghanistan and NATO\'s training of Iraq\'s security 
forces is not equal to the Spanish military\'s.

Afghanistan.  Morales stated that the GOS would examine 
various options in regard to providing assistance in the 
counternarcotics field.  However, the GOS could not provide a 
concrete response at this time as to the nature of such 
assistance due to the fact that the 2005 budget is still

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PHUM, SP, American - Spanish Relations 
SUBJECT: DEPUTY FM LEON ON CUBA, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, 
BILATERAL RELATIONS 
 
Classified By: Charge Bob Manzanares; reasons 1.5 (B) and (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Charge met with Deputy Foreign Minister 
Bernardino Leon on 12/9 to discuss GOS-USG differences on 
Cuba, overall bilateral relations, and Spanish participation 
in NATO missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Leon conveyed GOS 
displeasure with recent comments by WHA A/S Noriega 
criticizing GOS efforts to spur greater EU engagement with 
the Cuban Government.  He said the MFA Director General for 
Latin America would like to visit Washington to clarify the 
Spanish position, but that he could not do so without either 
gaining political cover for such a visit in the form of a 
neutral USG statement or waiting a suitable period to allow 
the episode to fade.  Leon underscored Spain\'s determination 
to press forward with its new Cuba policy.  On bilateral 
relations, Leon claimed that the opposition Popular Party 
(PP) is trying to foment USG-GOS tensions for internal 
political purposes.  He said the GOS genuinely wants good 
relations and will soon name a Special Envoy to the U.S. to 
promote better high-level relations.  Leon asserted that 
President Bush\'s November meeting with King Juan Carlos had 
revealed possible \"misunderstandings\" on the part of the USG 
with respect to the GOS, including the \"misperception\" that 
Zapatero represents the left wing of the Socialist Party.  On 
Iraq, Leon indicated that the January elections may represent 
an opportunity for the GOS to deepen its involvement, though 
participation in a NATO mission on the ground remains a 
sensitive issue.  The GOS is prepared to send forces to 
Afghanistan to help with the next round of elections, but 
remains non-commital on leading a PRT. 
 
2. (C) The GOS seems to understand the political liability of 
having poor relations with the USG and some, like Leon, are 
doing what they can to at least superficially improve ties. 
We expect they will keep asking us to \"watch their actions 
rather than their words.\"  We will continue to press for both 
more favorable actions and more favorable words.  On Cuba, it 
is telling that the GOS felt sufficiently stung by A/S 
Noriega\'s comments to seek the public support of Chirac in a 
high-level meeting on 12/8.  If Sandomingo does visit the 
Department in the next few weeks, it is important that he 
understand the depth of USG skepticism with respect to 
Spain\'s efforts to weaken EU policy towards Cuba.  We will 
not shift Madrid\'s course from greater engagement with 
Castro, but a sense that the USG is determined to hold the 
line may discourage the GOS from pushing the EU towards even 
greater rapprochement with Havana.  End Summary. 
 
//CUBA DOMINATES THE DISCUSSION// 
 
3. (C) Leon began by saying that he primarily wanted to speak 
with Charge regarding the USG\'s views on Spanish policy 
towards Cuba, and in particular recent comments by WHA A/S 
Noriega to the effect that the GOS had been manipulated by 
Castro regime in pursuing its new policy of engagement.  What 
especially rankled the MFA about USG\'s comments was the 
implication that the GOS was somehow pro-Castro.   Leon 
insisted that President Zapatero and FM Moratinos had 
maintained a consistent policy of placing democratic reforms 
as a pre-condition for improved EU ties with Cuba.  He said 
that Spain had worked within the EU Common Position and 
merely wanted to modify the Restrictive Measures on Cuba, 
\"which have proven ineffective,\" in order to develop a more 
sustainable EU-wide position.  Leon claimed the majority of 
EU countries wanted to change the policy and said that the 
Restrictive Measures had been undermined from the start by 
the refusal of some missions in  Havana (the Austrians, 
Belgians, Portuguese, and Greeks, he claimed) to invite 
dissidents to national day events.  He asserted that the UK 
had also changed tack in favor of greater engagement with 
Cuba because PM Blair was attempting to burnish his 
\"progressive\" credentials and said it was his understanding 
that the UK Embassy in Havana planned to join the above EU 
missions in finding a way around inviting dissidents to its 
national day.  The solution in his view was to replace the 
current measures with a broadly-supported policy of deeper 
engagement with the opposition, but at a level less visible 
than invitations to national day events. 
 
4. (C) In the interest of clarifying Spain\'s actions towards 
Cuba, Leon said he was eager to send DG for Latin America 
Javier Sandomingo to meet with A/S Noriega.  However, he said 
the GOS could not do so politically without seeming to be 
responding to a summons from Washington.  Leon said the 
problem was complicated by the presence of pro-PP diplomats 
in the Spanish Embassy in Washington who might leak slanted 
information to news services hostile to the Zapatero 
administration.  He suggested two possible courses of action: 
 
     -- That the Department make a neutral public statement 
regarding Spanish policy towards Cuba to the effect that each 
country had the right to determine its own best course for 
stimulating democratic reforms, immediately after which 
Sandomingo would travel to Washington; or, 
 
   -- If the USG could not make such a statement, then the 
GOS would wait a few days (more than a week) before sending 
Sandomingo in order to place an appropriate period of time 
between A/S Noriega\'s comments and Sandomingo\'s travel. 
 
5. (C) Charge replied that he would relay the suggestions to 
Washington, but that in either case it was important that 
Sandomingo travel to Washington to clarify Spain\'s view of 
how to move forward on Cuba.  Charge added that A/S Noriega\'s 
comments may have upset some in the GOS, but they accurately 
reflected USG skepticism of Spain\'s direction on Cuba.  In 
particular, the USG was concerned by Spain\'s decision to take 
the lead in bringing about the end of EU invitations to 
dissidents to EU national day events.  The negative symbolism 
and damage to the morale of the opposition - essentially 
telling them that they were not legitimate political actors - 
outweighed any advantage of renewed engagement. 
 
6. (C) Leon said that, far from distancing the EU from the 
opposition, the GOS proposed broader engagement, just in a 
different format than national day events.  \"After eight 
years of Aznar\'s hard line towards Cuba, the EU has not 
advanced its objectives with respect to improved human 
rights.  We want to try a different approach.\"  Leon said 
that it is clear to the GOS that Castro will not be 
overthrown and that it is more important that Spain be in a 
position to influence the next set of leaders.  He said that 
it was in Spain (and the USG\'s) interest to promote a soft 
landing for the next Cuban leaders rather than an explosive 
transition leading, perhaps, to the need for USG 
intervention.  He said the GOS and the USG should work 
together to make their different approaches complement each 
other.  Charge reiterated that USG held reservations 
regarding the effectiveness of the Spanish approach.  Leon 
said that Spain and the EU can only make overtures to Castro 
- if he rejects them then the imposition of new EU 
restrictive measures would be possible. 
 
//U.S.-SPAIN RELATIONS// 
 
7. (C) Leon said that Spain is politically divided at the 
moment, as demonstrated by the PP\'s decision to adopt an 
aggressive posture towards the GOS in hopes of bringing down 
the government and forcing early elections.  He claimed that 
PP leaders, including former President Aznar and former FM 
Ana Palacio, were trying to use their contacts in Washington 
to shape USG opinion against Zapatero.  The PP\'s objective, 
he said, is to use bilateral friction between the USG and the 
GOS as part of its campaign to unseat FM Moratinos, and 
eventually Zapatero.  Leon said it was important for USG 
officials, such as A/S Noriega, to understand that even 
comments in seemingly innocuous settings can get picked up by 
the press and have an impact far beyond that intended by the 
speaker. 
 
8. (C) Charge noted that we had been sending an identical 
message to GOS officials, with mixed success.  For example, 
the visit of King Juan Carlos sent an excellent, positive 
message regarding the importance of our bilateral relations, 
but the positive effect had been negated by the simultaneous 
visit of Venezuelan President Chavez to Madrid.  All of the 
good news from the King\'s visit was drowned out by three days 
of Chavez\' revolutionary rhetoric and tirades against the USG 
while standing next to Spanish officials. 
 
9. (C) Leon agreed that the Chavez visit had been a public 
relations failure, adding that the GOS only invited Chavez 
after months of requests from Chavez.  Turning to the King\'s 
meeting with President Bush, Leon said that there might be 
some \"misunderstandings\" on the part of the USG regarding the 
GOS.  He said that when King Juan Carlos had raised Spain\'s 
exclusion from November White House briefings on the Middle 
East to which other European (G-8) countries had been 
invited, President Bush, the King said, expressed surprise 
and reassured the King that Spain would be invited to future 
such meetings. 
10. (C) According to Leon, the King also commented on the 
importance of popular sentiment against Spanish deployment of 
troops to Iraq in Zapatero\'s decision to withdraw those 
forces.  However, Zapatero sent troops to Afghanistan as a 
gesture of solidarity with the USG in the fight against 
terrorism.  Leon said President Bush evinced surprise about 
the information on Spain\'s deployment to Afghanistan. 
Separately, Leon said he was surprised to hear that former 
President Bush had reportedly mused that President Zapatero 
might be further to the left politically than former 
President Felipe Gonzalez, with whom the USG had enjoyed good 
relations.  Leon insisted that Zapatero and Moratinos 
represented Spain\'s version of \"New Labour\" and that both 
leaders were well within the political mainstream. 
 
//SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE U.S.// 
 
11. (C) Leon said the GOS is fully cognizant of the 
importance of good relations with Washington and 
\"confidentially\" shared that Zapatero will soon name 
Socialist Parliamentarian Rafael Estrella as special envoy to 
the U.S.  Estrella, who is known for his pro-U.S. views, will 
travel frequently to the U.S. to promote strong high-level 
ties.  (COMMENT: This appointment could, and probably will 
be, interpreted as a further sign of the MFA\'s lack of 
confidence in their Embassy in Washington.  END COMMENT)  In 
a similar vein, Leon said the GOS plans to name pro-U.S. 
Socialists to head the \"Real Instituto Elcano,\" Spain\'s 
premier think tank, which in the Spanish system is partly 
directed by the ruling political party. 
 
//MORE FLEXIBLE ON IRAQ?// 
 
12. (C) Charge drew Leon\'s attention to the importance of 
allowing Spanish forces assigned to NATO commands to 
participate in all NATO missions, including missions in Iraq. 
 Leon said that the issue remained very sensitive for the GOS 
and that there are different schools of thought both within 
the MFA and among Zapatero\'s advisers as to how to proceed. 
The GOS will look to the successful conclusion of the Iraqi 
elections as a benchmark that may allow Spanish forces to 
participate more fully.  Leon indicated much greater 
political support for providing Spanish training for Iraqi 
police forces outside of Iraq. 
 
//AFGHANISTAN PRT// 
 
13. (C) Charge urged Leon to support Spanish leadership of a 
PRT in Afghanistan.  Leon said that the GOS was prepared to 
provide additional forces immediately to support the next 
round of elections, and, if that went well, to participate in 
a PRT.  He did not indicate willingness to have Spain lead a 
PRT.  Leon noted that, due to new legislation, the GOS now 
requires Parliamentary approval of any deployment of Spanish 
forces overseas, making strong political support for any 
mission an even more critical component for the GOS. 
 
//USG SUPPORT FOR UNSYG ANNAN// 
 
14. (C) Charge raised local press reports indicating that 
President Zapatero and French President Chirac had voiced 
strong support for the continued UN leadership of UNSYG 
Annan.  The press reports implied that Zapatero and Chirac 
were countering USG efforts to undermine Annan.  Charge said 
this was not the case and shared copies of Department 
statements indicating strong USG support for Annan.  He said 
it was important that the GOS not misinterpret USG intentions 
with respect to the oil-for-food investigation.  (NOTE: 
During the Zapatero-Chirac meeting, Chirac also stated his 
support for Spain\'s efforts to weaken EU measures against 
Cuba and attacked USG criticism of Spain\'s overtures to 
Castro.  END NOTE.) 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
15. (C) The GOS seems to understand the political liability 
of having poor relations with the USG and some, like Leon, 
will do what they can to at least superficially heal the 
damage.  We expect they will keep asking us to \"watch their 
actions rather than their words.\"  We will continue to press 
for both more favorable actions and more favorable words.  On 
Cuba, it is telling that the GOS felt sufficiently stung by 
A/S Noriega\'s comments to seek the public support of Chirac 
in a high-level meeting.  If Sandomingo does visit the 
Department in the next few weeks, it is important that he 
understand the depth of USG skepticism with respect to 
Spain\'s efforts to weaken EU policy towards Cuba.  We will 
not shift Madrid\'s course from greater engagement with 
Castro, but a sense that the USG is determined to hold the 
line may discourage the GOS from pushing the EU towards even 
greater rapprochement with Havana.

REF: (A) STATE 259661 (B) GAIN REPORT NUMBER:SP4028 
 
1. This message is sensitive but unclassified. 
 
2. (U) Summary: The Zapatero government is changing Spain\'s 
previously pro-biotech position to one more opposed to the 
technology.  This is clear from Environment Minister 
Narbona\'s statements, Spanish votes on EU Commission biotech 
proposals, a draft co-existence decree, and a generally go 
slow attitude on pending applications.  Similarly to many 
other countries though, the Agriculture Ministry largely 
remains a supporter of the technology. Embassy will make the 
President\'s office (Moncloa - Zapatero is called the 
\"President\" not Prime Minister) aware of the negative effects 
of these changes in policy.  End Summary 
 
ENVIRONMENT HOSTILE TO BIOTECH 
 
 
3. (U) Although the Zapatero government has not released a 
formal policy statement on agricultural biotechnology, it is 
clear from Environment Minister Cristina Narbona\'s remarks 
that she, at any rate, is hostile to the technology.  For 
example, she was quoted on June 23 by Agence France Presse as 
saying: \"In recent years Spain has become Europe\'s big 
granary of GM corn.  This is the result of a decision by the 
previous government to allow the growing in our country of a 
crop on which the scientific community has yet to form a 
conclusive opinion.  There are those who believe this should 
not be a cause for concern and others, more independent of 
the lines of research financed by the biotech industry, who 
hold a different opinion.\"  This is important because even 
though biotech-related decisions (for instance on EU votes) 
are subject to decisions by representatives from seven 
ministries and agencies in the so-called Inter-Ministerial 
Council, Environment is clearly very important on these 
issues. 
 
4. (U) The Inter-Ministerial Council is chaired by the 
Environment Ministry\'s Jaime Alejandre Martinez (Director 
General for Quality and Environmental Evaluation). 
Environment has two other Director General level 
representatives; Agriculture two; Health three; Industry 
(responsible for trade) one; Education and Science two; and 
Interior one.  Each Director General has one vote.  If there 
is a tie, Alejandre casts the determining vote. 
 
5. (SBU) EconOff and ESTOff met with Environment Subdirector 
for Air Quality and Risk Prevention Ana Fresno and Technical 
Analyst Lucia Roda on 12/9/04.  They were very upfront about 
the GOS\'s changes in position with respect to agricultural 
biotechnology and said they were politically, rather than 
scientifically, motivated.  Fresno said there was some 
scientific justification for proceeding with care on biotech 
rapeseed products but none with respect to corn. 
 
 
SPAIN EU VOTES 
 
 
6. (U) A local Monsanto representative provided the following 
list of votes this year on which Spain abstained and on which 
the Aznar government would probably have voted in favor. 
Fresno and Roda shared this opinion. 
 
a) NK603 Novel Foods (NL) - Regulatory Committee Vote, April 
30 
 
b) GT73 - Dir 2001/18/EC Import (NL) - Regulatory Committee 
Vote, June 16 
 
c) NK603 - 2001/18/EC - Environment Council Vote, June 28 (an 
especially noteworthy 
   decision given that Spain\'s regulatory authorities 
previously approved this event) 
 
d) NK603 Novel Foods - Agriculture Council Vote, July 19 
 
e) MON 863 - Dir 2001/18 Import (DE) - Regulatory Committee 
Vote, November 29 
 
PROPOSED COEXISTENCE DECREE 
 
 
7. (U) The Government of Spain is currently preparing a 
coexistence decree (ref B).  The government has not released 
an official proposal, but the latest available draft may make 
it more difficult in some cases to use already approved 
biotech corn varieties.  Essentially, the GOS intends to 
mandate a 25 meter distance between biotech and conventional 
fields.  The draft has both positive and negative elements as 
USDA notes (ref B). The USDA report states: \"If ultimately 
sustained, as we believe it is currently drafted, it could 
centralize, maybe even increase the use of genetically 
modified corn (GM) varieties in some regions.  However, the 
decree will likely impose requirements not imposed on 
producers and consumers of other, non-GM corn varieties.  As 
a result, it will also likely add to the production costs of 
GM corn, and could deter GM production on small parcels.\" 
Consistent with the pattern from other countries, the 
rhetoric from the Spanish Agriculture Ministry is also 
different from the Environment Ministry.  Agriculture 
Ministry Director General Angel Luis Alvarez Fernandez was 
quoted in the December 13 edition of El Pais as saying that 
the \"mixture of varieties is a frequent phenomenon in 
agriculture\".  Moreover, he criticized the use of the word 
\"contamination\" because the biotech varieties used in Spain 
\"do not involve a risk to human health\".  Nonetheless, the 
local Monsanto representative says that the draft decree is 
\"clearly discriminatory against GM crops and will inevitably 
have a dissuading effect on farmers\". 
 
PENDING APPLICATIONS 
 
8. (SBU)  The local Monsanto representative says that the 
National Biosafety Commission is \"uncharacteristically and 
unjustifiably dragging its feet with dossiers it is 
evaluating, specifically a Monsanto dossier, Roundup Ready 
corn for planting in Europe\".  A Pioneer representative told 
EconOff that biotech cotton variety applications were also 
taking a long time to be processed.  There is interest among 
farmers in the water-deprived Autonomous Region of Andalusia 
for obtaining access to certain kinds of biotech cotton 
varieties. 
 
 
GOS CPB REPRESENTATION 
 
 
9. (SBU) Ana Fresno and Lucia Roda attend the Cartagena 
Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) meetings and will go to Montreal 
as well.  Fresno is the GOS representative to the EU CPB 
coordination meetings.  EconOff asked whether representatives 
from the Agriculture and Trade Ministries attend these 
meetings as well.  Fresno regretted that they do not.  Fresno 
added that she meets occasionally with industry but not 
frequently.  Brussels coordinates more with industry 
interests she said but not extensively.  Fresno and Roda were 
quite familiar with USG concerns on Article 18.2(a) and 
liability and redress. 
 
 
COMMENT 
 
 
10. (SBU) We will make clear to Zapatero\'s Economics Advisor 
that the GOS could demonstrate a constructive approach in our 
overall relationship by working with us on trade policy 
issues, including agricultural biotechnology.  This will be a 
hard sell, but the President\'s office awareness of USG 
interest in GOS trade, as well as political, policy positions 
should be reinforced.

1.  (U) The American Embassy Spain Emergency Action Committee 
met on December 14, 2004, in response to REFTEL in order to 
assess the current situation and exchange perspectives on the 
possible threat. 
 
2.  (S) The EAC noted that parts of the information were 
relatively specific such as the parameters for timing and the 
nationality of the individuals involved, but that other 
aspects seemed to be too expansive and all-inclusive such as 
listing every possible method of attack and bringing into the 
threat the March 11 Spain train bombing \"magnitude of damage\" 
and even the recent Jeddah Consulate attack.  In addition, 
the alleged attackers included a list of nationalities to 
include most countries of current radical Islamic threat in 
the region. 
 
3.  (S) ORA mentioned that their Source for the information 
had advised them not to over-react to the information and 
stated that they would continue investigating the original 
Source in Damascus who walked-in to their Spanish Embassy to 
reveal this information, and would advise ORA of further 
results. 
 
4.  (S) The EAC conveyed concerns about the possibility of 
conflict with the \"no double standard\" policy since the 
Source information specifically mentioned American citizens 
in Madrid and American interests.  Under the current 
circumstances, and with the unknown validity of the Source, 
the EAC felt that a Warden Notice conveying the concern for 
recent and frequent Al-Qaida cell arrests in Spain and the 
escalation of ETA bombings in Spain and Madrid specifically, 
in conjunction with concerns for the intensive holiday 
shopping crowds, would justify a reason for sending out the 
Notice. 
 
5.  (U) Embassy elements will continue to monitor this 
evolving situation and will report anything further as it 
develops.

SUBJECT: SPAIN ON EU BATTERY DIRECTIVE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 259043 
 
1.  ESTHOFF discussed reftel December 15 with Environment 
Ministry Waste Prevention Deputy Director General Juan 
Martinez Sanchez, requesting answers to the five specified 
questions.  Martinez Sanchez provided the following responses 
(keyed to the five questions): 
 
--  Until December 8, 2004, Spain had placed a reservation on 
Article 4 of the draft EU Battery Directive.  The reservation 
was related to concerns about prohibiting the use of cadmium 
in batteries used in emergency light and alarm systems.  This 
reservation was lifted on December 8, 2004.  In Martinez 
Sanchez\'s words, \"Spain now morally supports\" the prohibition 
of lead/cadmium/mercury batteries.  However, Spain does not 
feel so strongly about the issue that it would block an EU 
consensus position in favor of a reinforced 
collection/recycling (vice prohibition) scheme. 
 
--  Spain does not have national legislation or regulations 
in place regarding the collection and disposition of used 
batteries and thus has no national collection system in 
place.  Spain plans to adopt a national collection system 
\"shortly.\" 
 
--  Regarding eventual collection targets, Spain hopes to 
adopt a national collection system that, following a ten-year 
phase in period, would capture at least 60 percent of used 
batteries. 
 
--  As for the financing of eventual collection, Spain 
believes that battery producers/importers should assume all 
costs for the future national collection system.  Such 
financing would be consistent with Spanish Law 10/96 on waste 
management. 
 
--  The Spanish Environment Ministry has not/not assessed the 
impact the draft EU Battery Directive would have on domestic 
appliance and battery producers.  Spain has only one 
manufacturer of portable batteries and this company makes 
no/no nickel-cadmium batteries. 
 
2.  COMMENT:  Spanish law permits individual Spanish regions 
to adopt voluntary battery collection/recycling schemes. 
Such a scheme is in place in Madrid and several other regions.

5.  THREAT ASSESSMENT: 
 
In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain -- including resort/convention 
areas such as Benidorm -- attract a large number of criminals 
and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of 
opportunity against the unwary do occur.  Carry only 
essential items including a photocopy of your passport\'s 
photo page.  Visitors can protect themselves against crime by 
being street-smart, alert and aware of their surroundings. In 
the event you are victimized by crime, or experience any 
security-related incident, please contact the Embassy\'s 
Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after hours at 
91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive 
a security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State\'s website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy\'s 
website (www.embusa.es). 
 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department 
of State continues to develop information on any potential 
security threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible 
threat information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel/state.gov.  In addition to information on the 
Internet, U.S. travelers can hear recorded information by 
calling the Department of State in Washington, D.C. at

TREASURY FOR TRACI PHILLIPS 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EFIN, ECON, SP 
SUBJECT: SPANISH BUDGET VETOED IN THE SENATE AS EXPECTED 
 
REF: MADRID 4385 
 
1. Summary.  Spain\'s Senate vetoed December 13 the Socialist 
government\'s 2005 budget.  The budget, which already passed 
the lower house, will now be returned for further 
consideration.  The lower house may pass the budget over the 
Senate\'s objections next week by an absolute majority, or by 
a simple majority in two months time.  This act marks the 
first time Spain\'s Senate has returned a budget to the lower 
house.  End Summary. 
 
2. The Popular Party and three nationalist parties joined 
forces to reject the government\'s budget December 13 with a 
vote of 140-117.  The budget will now return to the lower 
house for reconsideration for the first time in Spanish 
history.  The lower house will review the budget next week. 
The minority Socialist government can pass the budget over 
the Senate\'s objection if it can maintain the absolute 
majority it had on the first reading of the budget in the 
lower house.  If the lower house fails to pass the budget 
next week, it can be passed by a simple majority in February. 
 The government would continue to operate in January and 
February based on one-twelfth of 2004 budget numbers each 
month. 
 
3. The Socialist government negotiated an absolute majority 
in the lower house where it holds the largest number of 
seats.  It received the support of the Republican Left of 
Catalonia (ERC) and the communist United Left (IU) when the 
budget passed the lower house. 
 
4. The Socialist government faced a different situation in 
the Senate, where the opposition Popular Party (PP) holds the 
most seats.  In order for the government to pass a law in the 
Senate, it requires the support of all non-PP parties. 
Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes opposed 
additional negotiations with regional parties in the Senate 
that were not allies in the budget passage in the lower 
house.  The opposition PP joined with Catalonia\'s Convergence 
and Union, the Galician National Party, the Basque 
Nationalist Party, the Canary Coalition and the Mixed Party 
Senator to embarrass the government with the veto.  The PP 
economic spokesperson in Parliament offered no substantive 
objections to the budget, but commented that the Senate\'s 
veto shows this government\'s weakness.  A contact in the 
Ministry of Economy rejected that analysis, noting that 
Solbes stuck to his spending limits, and by not negotiating a 
face-saving deal with regional parties in the Senate, proved 
that he is a strict budgetary guardian. 
 
4. Comment.  The historic veto of the Socialist government\'s 
first budget may amount to little more than parliamentary 
bickering and the opposition\'s attempt to embarrass its 
political rival.  Contacts at the Ministry of Economy and 
Finance predict that the government will have the votes to 
pass the budget next week over the Senate\'s objections.  The 
important message coming out of the Spanish budget debate is 
that Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes has the 
will to maintain budgetary spending limits.  Solbes preferred 
that the Socialists accept the embarrassment of a Senate veto 
to meeting additional budgetary demands of regional parties. 
This budget year, the Socialists will be able to maintain the 
support of their alliance with ERC and IU in the lower house 
to pursue a conservative fiscal policy.  The question is 
whether Solbes and the Socialist government will be able to 
maintain this alliance in the coming years under less rosy 
economic conditions.

DEPARTMENT PASS TO TTIC 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, ASEC, SP, Counterterrorism 
SUBJECT: SPAIN: 2004 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: A) STATE 245841 B) STATE 259427 
 
1. Per Ref A instructions, the following is the 2004 
terrorism report submission for Spain. 
 
2. Spain is a strong ally in the war on terrorism, 
authorizing the use of military bases to support Operation 
Enduring Freedom and sending troops to Afghanistan to provide 
added security during that country,s national elections. 
Spain suffered a massive terrorist attack in March, when 
Islamic extremists detonated explosives on commuter trains in 
Madrid killing 190 and wounding hundreds of others.  Spain 
scored significant successes in its decades-long effort to 
eliminate the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) terrorist 
group, in part through increased police cooperation with 
France. 
 
On the morning of March 11, terrorists detonated ten bombs on 
commuter trains in Madrid, including five near Atocha, the 
city,s biggest train station, killing 190 and wounding 
hundreds more.  After initially suspecting ETA involvement, 
police quickly discovered that Islamic extremists associated 
with the \"Moroccan Islamic Combat Group\" (GICM) and Algerian 
terrorist organizations were the actual perpetrators of the 
attacks.  On April 2, authorities discovered an explosive 
device under the high-speed railway connecting Madrid and 
Seville.  The bomb, which was of a material similar to that 
used in the commuter train bombings, failed to detonate for 
unexplained reasons.  On April 3, seven suspects sought by 
the police in connection with the March 11 attacks detonated 
explosives in an apartment in a Madrid suburb in order to 
avoid arrest by the police.  All seven suspects and one 
police officer were killed in the explosion. 
Authorities are holding 19 suspects in connection with the 
March 11 bombings, pending trial on charges of murder and/or 
belonging to a terrorist organization.   In November, a 
Spanish judge issued the first sentence in the case, 
sentencing a 16-year-old male to six years in a juvenile 
prison facility and five years probation for helping the 
conspirators obtain the explosives.  Spanish police are 
investigating a further 20 individuals for possible links to 
the bombing perpetrators. 
 
3. //A. GOS SUPPORT FOR THE GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST 
TERRORISM// 
 
Spain has continued to authorize the use of its military 
bases at Rota and Moron in support of military operations in 
Afghanistan.  Spain provided military support to Operation 
Enduring Freedom and ISAF, and supported the reconstruction 
of Afghanistan with humanitarian and developmental 
assistance. Spain doubled its military contingent in 
Afghanistan from 500 to over 1,000 to provide added 
protection during national elections.  On December 17, 
Attorney General Ashcroft visited Spain to sign the bilateral 
instruments to the U.S.-EU Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty and 
Extradition Agreement, deepening bilateral judicial 
cooperation.  Attorney General Ashcroft met with Spain,s 
Minister of Justice and Minister of the Interior to discuss 
increased cooperation on terrorism investigations.  During 
the year, the FBI and the Department of Justice worked with 
the Spanish National Court to assist in investigations and 
prosecutions of Al-Qaida suspects. 
 
Spain has requested talks with the U.S. on the possible 
formation of a joint counterterrorism investigative unit, 
similar to a unit Spain has developed with France.    U.S. 
agencies, including the Department of State, are reviewing 
the proposal. 
 
//B. COUNTERTERRORISM ACTIONS// 
 
Spanish authorities continued their strong cooperation with 
the United States on counterterrorism, primarily by sharing 
law enforcement information on suspected terrorist 
organizations and by supporting efforts to rebuild 
Afghanistan.  Since the September 11 attacks, Spain has 
arrested over 100 persons suspected of links to Al-Qaida. 
 
-- In May, a Spanish judge ordered the detention of three 
Algerian nationals and one Spanish national for their ties to 
an al-Qaida cell in Hamburg, Germany.  The four detainees 
were believed to be planning attacks against commuters in the 
Paris metro system similar to the March 11 Madrid bombings. 
 
-- In September, A Spanish judge filed additional charges 
against March 11 bombing suspect Jamal Zougam for having 
collaborated with jailed Al-Qaida financier and cell leader 
Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas. 
 
//C. LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS// 
 
Law enforcement officials moved aggressively in the wake of 
the March 11 bombings, arresting over 50 suspects, holding 19 
for trial, and continuing investigations of a further 20 
suspects.  Spain successfully requested the temporary 
transfer from Italy of alleged March 11 organizer Rabei Osman 
El Sayed to be interrogated regarding his role in the 
attacks.  Spain and France launched a joint counterterrorism 
investigative team focused on ETA and Islamic terrorist 
groups, augmenting an earlier agreement that allowed police 
to work on counterterrorism investigations in each other,s 
countries.  This increased cooperation helped France and 
Spain carry out a major series of arrests of ETA organizers 
in October, including the capture of ETA leaders Mikel Antza 
and Soledad Iparragirre in France. 
 
During the year, Spain also signed or added to bilateral 
counterterrorism agreements with the UK, Sweden, Portugal, 
and Austria. 
 
On May 10, Spain and Morocco agreed to establish a mechanism 
to share information on suspected terrorists in both 
countries.  In September Spain and Morocco formed a judicial 
cooperation group to advise their governments on how to 
improve cooperation on terrorism-related crimes. 
 
On December 17, Spanish police arrested Moroccan national 
Hassan El Haski and three other members of the Moroccan 
Islamic Combat Group in the Canary Islands on charges of 
participating in the March 11 train bombings and membership 
in a terrorist group.  The four suspected terrorists had fled 
Belgium and France and gone to Spain to avoid arrest. 
 
//D. JUDICIAL RESPONSE// 
 
Spanish authorities have reacted vigorously to impede and 
disrupt suspected terrorist activities in areas under their 
jurisdiction and to cooperate with other countries in 
terrorism investigations.  In 2003, Spanish authorities 
provided significant information in response to U.S. requests 
for information concerning the activities of Mohamed Atta in 
Spain prior to the September 11 attacks.  On December 17, 
Attorney General Ashcroft visited Spain to sign the bilateral 
protocols to the U.S.-EU Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty and 
Extradition Agreement, instruments that will improve judicial 
cooperation, including on terrorism cases. 
 
In addition to the arrests carried out following the March 11 
attacks, a Spanish judge ordered the arrest of more than 35 
suspected extremists charged with plotting bomb attacks 
against Spain,s High Court, the headquarters of the 
opposition Popular Party (PP), Madrid,s largest soccer 
stadium, an office building, and other landmarks.  Several of 
the suspects arrested in this sweep were reportedly common 
criminals recruited in prison to perform suicide attacks. 
Spain requested the extradition from Switzerland of Mohamed 
Achraf, the alleged ringleader of this terrorist conspiracy. 
Spain provided information to Swiss authorities that allowed 
them to elevate the charges against Achraf, who was being 
held on immigration violations. 
 
In 2003, Spain requested the transfer of Hamed Abdelrahman 
Ahmed from U.S. detention at Guantanamo Naval Base, where he 
had been held as an enemy combatant following his capture 
with Taliban forces in Afghanistan.  Ahmed was transferred to 
Spain on February 13 and jailed on charges of maintaining 
links to Al-Qaida.  In July, Judge Baltasar Garzon released 
Ahmed on bail pending further investigation.  Spain is 
seeking the transfer of an additional three enemy combatants 
being held in Guantanamo. 
 
Spain successfully sought the temporary transfer from Italy 
of Rabei Osman El Sayed, allegedly among the key organizers 
of the March 11 attacks, on murder and terrorism charges.  El 
Sayed was transferred to Spanish custody for six months 
beginning on December 7. 
 
-- Impediments to Extradition.  Spain supports the EU 
consensus opposing extradition to the U.S. if the prisoner 
will be subject to the death penalty.  A U.S. request for 
extradition of terrorist suspects to military tribunals would 
also pose problems for the Spanish judiciary.  In practice, 
extradition to the U.S. is possible once Spanish concerns 
regarding the application of the death penalty are resolved 
by prior agreement with U.S. authorities. 
 
//E. LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES// 
 
Law enforcement agencies have the authority to intercept 
wire, oral, and electronic communications, when authorized to 
do so by an investigating magistrate.  Law enforcement 
officials may initiate terrorist investigations based on 
intelligence information.  Intercepted information collected 
via authorized methods may be used in court, but since court 
testimony is available to the public, the authorities are 
reluctant to release such information for fear of 
compromising sources and methods.  Spanish police have good 
capability for collecting forensic data, such as photographs 
and fingerprints. 
 
//F. INVESTIGATIONS OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS// 
 
Spain is a leading proponent within the EU of increased 
cooperation on terrorism investigations.  Spanish judicial 
and police officials work closely with U.S. authorities in 
cases of possible bilateral interest.  In May, Spain signed 
an agreement with Morocco to increase cooperation on border 
security in the Straits of Gibraltar, in part to reinforce 
bilateral counterterrorism efforts.  Spain worked closely 
with the U.S. to meet new passport security requirements for 
its nationals. 
 
//G. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS// 
 
Within the EU, Spain remains a strong proponent of 
international cooperation against terrorism.  In April, Spain 
joined other EU members in updating and reaffirming the EU 
list of terrorist organizations and terrorist suspects, which 
includes ETA and ETA-affiliated political organizations, as 
well as 19 ETA members currently being sought by Spanish 
authorities. 
 
The government maintains several websites dealing with 
terrorism.  Government sites include: 
 
-- Ministry of the Interior:  www.mir.es/oris/index.htm 
 
-- Civil Guard:  www.guardiacivil.org/terrorismo/index.jsp 
 
-- National Police:  www.mir.es/policia/linea/ter prin.htm 
 
//I. EFFORTS TO COMBAT EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY// 
 
After more than 30 years of fighting against ETA terrorism, 
both the government and civil society remain focused on 
political violence in the Basque Region.  The March 11 
attacks came as a shock to Spanish society since most 
observers believed that there was very little tension or 
extremist organization within Spain,s growing Muslim 
immigrant community.  Even after the March 11 attacks, 
anti-violence campaigns remain focused on ETA. 
 
Civil society efforts to fight violence in the Basque Region 
are extremely well developed and include organizations such 
as \"Gesto Por la Paz8 (Gesture for Peace ) www.gesto.org) 
and the \'Asociacion de Victimas del Terrorismo\" (Association 
of Victims of Terrorism).  The victims of the March 11 
attacks borrowed from the experience of ETA victims and have 
formed their own organization, whose leaders testified before 
the Parliamentary commission investigating the train 
bombings.  The government is supportive of such citizen 
efforts, encouraging their participation in public events and 
placing links to their organizations on government websites. 
 
//J. WHERE GOVERNMENT HAS DEPLOYED MILITARY FORCES// 
 
Spain deployed over 1,000 troops in Afghanistan during 2004 
to participate in Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF and to 
provide additional security during Afghanistan,s national 
elections.  In 2003, Spain deployed 1,300 troops to southern 
Iraq as part of the Coalition Forces, but the ruling 
Socialist Government withdrew those forces following its 
electoral victory in March. 
 
//K. MAJOR CHANGES IN STANCE TOWARDS TERRORISM// 
 
As a long-time victim of ETA violence and a recent victim of 
a massive Islamic terrorist attack, Spain places combating 
terrorism as one of its highest priorities, both in domestic 
affairs and in foreign relations.  There were massive 
demonstrations against terrorism following the March 11 train 
bombings, similar to demonstrations following some 
high-profile ETA terrorist attacks in recent years.  Spain is 
a proponent of vigorous international judicial cooperation 
against terrorism, a position that enjoys strong public 
support.  There is significantly less public support for 
military action against terrorism, though the government has 
underscored its commitment to support operations in 
Afghanistan. 
 
//L.  PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARDS TERRORISM 
 
See K 
//M. SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST GROUPS// 
 
Spain does not harbor or support any terrorist organizations. 
 
//N. PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM// 
 
Spain has not supported any of the state sponsors of 
terrorism on a terrorism-related issue. 
 
//O. STATUS OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY 
 
Several terrorist organizations are active in Spain, 
including Al-Qaida, the Moroccan Islamic Combat Group (GICM), 
and ETA.  The Government has virtually eliminated the 
domestic terrorist organization First of October Anti-Fascist 
Resistance Group (GRAPO). 
 
Spain enforces the EU ban on 36 domestic and international 
terrorist organizations.  Spain continues to maintain a \"Law 
of Political Parties,\" which established a judicial process 
to de-legalize political parties that provide concrete 
support for terrorist groups.  The main organization affected 
by this law is the ETA-affiliated group Batasuna, which was 
ordered to disband and barred from the political process. 
 
//P. AREAS WHERE TERRORISTS ARE FREE TO OPERATE// 
 
The Spanish Government maintains effective state control 
throughout its territory. 
 
//Q. MAJOR CT DEVELOPMENTS// 
 
On the morning of March 11, terrorists detonated ten bombs on 
commuter trains in Madrid, including five near Atocha, the 
city,s biggest train station, killing 190 and wounding 
hundreds more.  After initially suspecting ETA involvement, 
police quickly discovered that Islamic extremists associated 
with the \"Moroccan Islamic Combat Group\" (GICM) and Algerian 
terrorist organizations were the actual perpetrators of the 
attacks.  On April 2, authorities discovered an explosive 
device under the high-speed railway connecting Madrid and 
Seville.  The bomb, which was of a material similar to that 
used in the commuter train bombings, failed to detonate for 
unexplained reasons.  On April 3, seven suspects sought by 
the police in connection with the March 11 attacks detonated 
explosives in an apartment in a Madrid suburb in order to 
avoid arrest by the police.  All seven suspects and one 
police officer were killed in the explosion. 
Authorities are holding 19 suspects in connection with the 
March 11 bombings, pending trial on charges of murder and/or 
belonging to a terrorist organization.   In November, a 
Spanish judge issued the first sentence in the case, 
sentencing a 16-year-old male to six years in a juvenile 
prison facility and five years probation for helping the 
conspirators obtain the explosives.  Spanish police are 
investigating a further 20 individuals for possible links to 
the bombing perpetrators. 
 
In addition to investigating the March 11 bombings, Spanish 
police acted against other international terrorist 
organizations operating in Spain, including: 
 
-- The \"NOVA I\" and \"NOVA II\" police operations in November 
to disrupt efforts by Islamic extremists to bomb Spain,s 
High Court, the headquarters of the opposition Popular Party, 
Madrid,s largest soccer stadium, a major office building, 
and other landmarks.   Over 35 suspects were arrested and the 
investigation remained open as of the end of the year. 
Several of the suspects arrested in this sweep were 
reportedly common criminals recruited in prison to perform 
suicide attacks.  Spain requested the extradition from 
Switzerland of Mohamed Achraf, the alleged ringleader of this 
terrorist conspiracy.  Spain provided information to Swiss 
authorities that allowed them to elevate the charges against 
Achraf, who was being held on immigration violations. 
 
-- In May, a Spanish judge ordered the detention of three 
Algerian nationals and one Spanish national for their ties to 
an al-Qaida cell in Hamburg, Germany.  The four detainees 
were believed to be planning attacks against commuters in the 
Paris metro system similar to the March 11 Madrid bombings. 
 
-- Police in Barcelona arrested ten Pakistani nationals 
suspected of providing logistical and financial support to 
Islamic extremist groups outside of Spain, including members 
of Al-Qaida and the killers of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl. 
 
-- In November, a judge ordered the detention of an 
Al-Jazeera television network journalist with alleged ties to 
the Spain-based Al-Qaida network of Imad Eddin Barakat 
Yarkas.  The journalist had been released on bail in 2003 for 
health reasons. 
 
-- In December, police arrested three Algerian nationals, 
Abdelkader Lebik, Ibdallah Ibn Moutalib Kaddouri, and Brahim 
Amman, for involvement with the Catalan-based \"Protectors of 
the Salafist Current,\" a radical Islamic cell largely 
dismantled in 2003. 
 
Separately, ETA continued its bombing campaign, even as the 
police scored significant successes against the organization 
that included the capture of 76 ETA members during the year. 
ETA-related developments included: 
 
-- In February, Spanish police arrested two ETA members 
driving a van carrying 500 kilograms of explosives, allegedly 
intended for attacks in Madrid. 
 
-- Spain,s assistance to French authorities in an 
investigation that led to the October 3 arrest of ETA leaders 
Mikel Antza and Soledad Iparragirre.  Antza was the top ETA 
organizer at the time of his arrest and Iparragirre was 
sought in connection with 14 murders and was believed to be 
leading ETA,s extortion operations. 
 
-- ETA carried out a series of bombings of tourist sites 
during the summer tourist season.  The bombings did not 
result in any significant injuries. 
 
-- ETA detonated 12 bombs on December 3 and 6 in Madrid and 
eight other cities, resulting in minor injuries to about a 
dozen people.  Most observers interpreted the December 
bombings as ETA,s response to police successes during the 
year that had decimated the organization,s logistical arm.

SUBJECT: POPULAR PARTY FORESEES ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AHEAD 
FOR SPAIN 
 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Whitney Baird for reasons 1.4 (b) and 
 (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: The opposition Popular Party\'s Economic 
Spokesperson in Parliament Miguel Arias Canete predicted 2005 
would be a good year for Spain, but that beginning in 2006 
Spain\'s economy would sour and imperil Spain\'s Socialist 
government.  He declared strong respect for Minister of 
Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes and the economic team, but 
noted that Solbes faces strong challenges in shepherding 
Spain\'s budget and economy in a cabinet of more radical 
political heavyweights.  Arias Canete expressed sympathy with 
respect to our biotech position, noting that he was a strong 
proponent of biotechnology during his previous position as 
Minister of Agriculture.  He offered assistance with biotech 
issues with Spanish deputies in the European Parliament.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
Economic Outlook 
---------------- 
 
2. (U) Arias Canete characterized Spain\'s 2005 economic 
outlook as solid.  He stated that the fiscal environment of 
stable spending growth and balanced budget was a gift to the 
Socialists (PSOE) from the previous Popular Party (PP) 
government.  However, he noted Spain\'s inflation rate of 
about 1.3 percent higher than the EU average as an area of 
concern.  He also noted that since Spain was an EU member and 
EU monetary policy was predicated on the sluggish German 
economy, Spain would not be able to use monetary policy to 
curb its inflation.  Cheap interest rates have contributed to 
the steep rise in Spanish housing prices in the past few 
years. 
 
3. (C) According to PP economic projections, although the 
outlook for 2005 is \"solid\", Spain\'s economy will slow 
significantly in 2006.  Arias Canete believes a recession is 
probable and that the PSOE government will be forced to call 
early elections due to the resulting economic stress. 
 
Minister Solbes and the Economic Team 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Arias Canete offered high praise for PSOE Minister of 
Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes.  He noted Solbes\' personal 
professional stature as a guardian of the European Monetary 
Union treaties in Brussels and for bringing France and 
Germany to court for breaking budget deficit rules.  Arias 
Canete believes Solbes, with his EU experience, is truly 
committed to ensuring budgetary stability during his tenure. 
 
5. (C) He was less certain, however, whether Minister Solbes 
would be able to maintain the support of President Zapatero 
and keep future efforts at increasing spending in line with 
his budgetary standards.  According to Arias Canete\'s 
sources, Solbes is regularly opposed by the President\'s 
economic policy advisor Miguel Sebastian.  Sebastian 
regularly announces new economic policy changes without 
Solbes\' comment.  Solbes also faces challenges in Zapatero\'s 
Cabinet.  In the Spanish system, there are multiple cabinet 
levels.  The first meeting each week the Secretary of State\'s 
meeting (note: equivalent to Deputies\' Committee).  According 
to Arias Canete, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, the 
Secretary of State for Economy and Budget is often 
 
SIPDIS 
outmaneuvered by Economic Advisor Miguel Sebastian at these 
meetings.  Minister Solbes is then forced to try to overcome 
the decision of the Secretaries of State in the Council of 
Ministers.  Arias Canete is not sure Solbes will continue to 
prevail in these battles, or that he will want to keep 
fighting if the economy sours. 
 
6. (C) Regarding rumors that Solbes might not finish his 
entire term, Arias Canete noted that Solbes is a man of his 
word and that he is likely to keep his promise and serve 
throughout this government.  However, if in future budgets 
the government pushes spending to a deficit level beyond 3 
percent, breaking the EMU standards, Mr. Solbes might 
consider resignation.  Arias Canete noted (somewhat jokingly) 
that he would do everything he could to push Solbes out of 
office, because any PSOE replacement would be a much easier 
political target for the PP. 
 
Economic Reform on Hold 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) Arias Canete mentioned several areas where economic 
reform was necessary, but is convinced that the Socialist 
government is unable or unwilling to carry through.  The key 
area for reform is the labor market.  Arias Canete argued 
that the link between inflation and wages in Spain without 
any correlation to productivity needs to be broken.  He also 
mentioned the need to improve competition in the marketplace, 
especially in telecoms and energy.  Though the economic team 
may well support many of these changes, Arias Canete does not 
believe they will get much traction in the current 
government.  He noted that most of the PSOE ministers are far 
more left-wing in their economic philosophy than the economic 
team and that President Zapatero is not a strong leader, but 
a compromiser unwilling to push a policy unpopular in his own 
party. 
 
Biotech 
------- 
 
8. (U) Arias Canete sympathized with the U.S. position on 
biotech issues.  He mentioned that he approved several seed 
varieties during his tenure as Minister of Agriculture.  He 
also noted that he is being taken to court along with the 
succeeding PP Minister of Agriculture for approving biotech 
strains that could allegedly threaten the environment.  Arias 
Canete believes that biotech crops are very important for 
Spain, noting that new strains of cotton are greatly desired 
by farmers in the south.  He asked us to inform him of any 
biotech legislation of importance that passes through the 
European Parliament.  He is willing to assist us by lobbying 
PP members in the European Parliament. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Arias Canete is clearly interested in maintaining 
close ties with the United States.  He is a well-informed, 
articulate spokesperson for PP policies.  He provided us with 
a number of concise, cogent PP position papers on economic 
issues.  They show this group is serious, and views itself as 
only temporarily in opposition.

SUBJECT: SPAIN: INDECISIVE ON ISAF STAGE TWO ROLE 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires J. Robert Manzanares, reasons 1.4(b) a 
nd (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Charge met December 20 with Spanish 
National Security Advisor Carles Casajuana to discuss Spain\'s 
role in ISAF stage two.  Casajuana was very reluctant to 
commit the Zapatero government to any role in stage two. 
Casajuana said it was very unlikely the GOS would announce a 
decision on its participation in stage two before early 
February, given that parliament will soon recess until late 
January.  In any event, he believed that if Spain were to 
decide to increase its role in Afghanistan, it would most 
likely add to its troop presence temporarily to provide 
security for parliamentary elections, as it did for 
presidential elections in the fall.  Casajuana believed it 
would be very difficult for Spain to lead a provincial 
reconstruction team (PRT).  Embassy believes that in 
considering its potential role in ISAF stage two, the 
Zapatero government remains intensely focused on minimizing 
any risk to its forces.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) Charge told Casajuana Spain\'s role in ISAF stage two 
would be very important for continued progress in 
Afghanistan, and said the U.S. urged Spain to strongly 
consider leading a PRT and assisting with the forward support 
base (FSB) in Herat.  If Spain could not do both, Charge said 
we hoped Spain would lead a PRT.  The U.S., added Charge, 
hoped Spain could announce its decision to increase its role 
in ISAF stage two by mid-January to permit ISAF to begin 
fortifying itself as soon as possible in preparation for 
parliamentary elections. 
 
3.  (C) Casajuana replied Spain was considering the PRT and 
FSB, and was also weighing the possibility of adding troops 
to its contingent in Afghanistan on a short-term basis to 
provide increased security for the parliamentary elections. 
Unfortunately, it was highly unlikely Spain would be able to 
announce a decision on an increased role in Afghanistan 
before early February, because the Spanish government would 
have to take any proposed change in its posture in 
Afghanistan to the parliament, and parliament would soon 
recess until late January.  Casajuana later hedged a bit on 
this, saying the GOS would definitely have to bring a 
decision to lead a PRT before parliament, but might not have 
to do so to move assets to Herat or increase its troop 
presence temporarily.  Nonetheless, even in the latter two 
cases, Zapatero may want to get parliament\'s assent \"for 
political reasons.\"  Casajuana also said the Zapatero 
government would have to \"address public opinion issues\" in 
reaching a decision on increasing its role in Afghanistan, 
because many Spaniards question why Spanish forces are in 
Afghanistan in the first place. 
 
4.  (C) Charge said it would be useful if the Zapatero 
government could at least reach a political decision on 
Spain\'s role in ISAF by mid-January, even if it would not be 
able to bring the decision to parliament before early 
February.  Casajuana thought it would be very difficult for 
the Zapatero government to do so because it did not want to 
\"get too far out in front of parliament.\"  The easiest 
decision for the government to make would be to commit 
additional troops for a short period of time to provide 
security for the elections, as Spain did in the fall for the 
presidential elections. 
 
5.  (C) On the question of public opinion, Charge said he 
hoped parliament and the average Spaniard understood their 
country shares a common interest with the others in 
Afghanistan in fighting international terrorism and in 
reconstructing a democratic Afghanistan that no longer 
harbors terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda.  A PRT, in 
particular, provides Spain a unique opportunity to 
participate in reconstruction efforts and improve the lives 
of the average Afghan.  This should be something the average 
Spaniard could support, emphasized Charge.  Casajuana agreed 
and said he simply meant the government would have to do a 
good job explaining its policy to the public. 
 
6.  (C) Charged then explained the GOS was sending mixed 
signals on what it was willing to do in Afghanistan, with 
Foreign Minister Moratinos suggesting Spain would be willing 
to increase its role, and Minister of Defense Bono later 
saying Spain would not be sending any more troops to 
Afghanistan.  Casajuana said Spain\'s contribution to ISAF is 
still very much an open debate, and certainly no decision has 
been made not to send additional forces there.  Asked what he 
believed the chances were that Spain would ultimately lead a 
PRT, Casajuana said he thought it would be difficult but he 
wasn\'t ruling it out. 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  Despite our efforts to draw him out, 
Casajuana was extremely reluctant to commit to any position 
on Spain\'s role in ISAF stage two.  He left us with the 
impression that it was very unlikely Spain would lead a PRT, 
and that the GOS remains very much undecided on what other 
role, if any, Spain will play in ISAF stage two.  One thing 
that can be said after this meeting:  The Zapatero 
government\'s primary concern in considering whether or not to 
increase its role in ISAF remains minimizing any risk that 
Spanish forces could suffer a casualty as a result of their 
participation.

proposal, noting U.S. concerns regarding lack of clarity in 
the EU\'s ITER proposal, and underscoring our commitment to

strong commitment to the six-party framework, said he viewed 
developments over the past four weeks (i.e., since he had 
last met with ESTHOFF to discuss ITER -- see Ref B) as a 
mixture of good and bad news. 
 
2.  (C) As for the bad news, Alejaldre said he was starting 
to doubt whether the EU could seal a deal with Japan based on 
the Japanese host/no-host proposal.  He attributed his 
growing doubts to alleged Japanese intransigence.  On the 
positive side of the ledger, Alejaldre said that he believed 
incoming Commissioner Potocnik was less pro-French than his 
predecessor and more committed to the six-party framework. 
 
3.  (C) Alejaldre indicated that he was virtually certain 
that the EU\'s Competitiveness Council would miss its December 
31 deadline for an ITER decision (noting that late December 
in Europe was like August -- nothing gets done).  He said 
that the Council would next meet on March 7-8 and that Spain 
understood that the EU\'s complete financing package would be 
released at that meeting.  That said, Alejaldre thought 
Commissioner Potocnik would respond to DOE Deputy Secretary 
McSlarrow\'s letter early next year and that the response 
would address the U.S.\'s concerns by previewing the general 
parameters of the EU ITER financing scheme.

SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL STRATEGY REPORT 
2004: SPAIN 
 
REF: STATE 254401 
 
I. SUMMARY: In 2004, Spain continued its efforts to enforce 
the 1988 UN Drug Convention as well as other EU conventions 
on counter narcotics trafficking. Spanish National Police, 
the Guardia Civil and Customs Services interdicted record 
amounts of cocaine, hashish, and heroin and performed 
numerous enforcement operations throughout Spain to arrest 
distributors of synthetic drugs, such as LSD and ecstasy. 
However, officials have acknowledged that Spain continued to 
be a significant transit point and top consumer of cocaine 
and hashish in Europe. This issue prompted the newly elected 
Socialist government to restructure its drug policy 
coordination body, the National Drug Plan (PND), by assigning 
responsibility of its harm reduction unit to the Ministry of 
Health and its supply reduction unit to a new Department of 
Security within the Ministry of Interior. The GOS ranks drug 
trafficking as one of its most important law enforcement 
concerns, and has continued to maintain excellent relations 
with U.S. law enforcement. Cooperation between GOS and USG 
officials on Spain\'s domestic narcotic efforts and joint 
enforcement efforts in Latin America is a top policy 
objective of the new Spanish government. 
 
II. STATUS OF COUNTRY. 
 
Spain remains a principal gateway for cocaine transported 
from Latin American countries, such as Columbia and 
Venezuela, or transshipped from West Africa through Morocco. 
Spanish police continue to seize large amounts of Moroccan 
hashish along Spain\'s southern coast, some of which is 
trafficked by illegal immigrants. The majority of heroin that 
arrives in Spain is transported via the Balkan route from 
Turkey.  No coca is grown in Spain, and production of 
cannabis and opium is minimal. Illicit refining and 
manufacturing of drugs in Spain is also minimal although 
small-scale laboratories of synthetic drugs such as LSD are 
discovered and confiscated each year. Spain has a 
pharmaceutical industry that produces precursor chemicals. 
There is effective control of precursor shipments within 
Spain from the point of origin to destination, administered 
under the PND. Spain is a transit point to the U.S. for 
ecstasy and other synthetic drugs produced mainly in the 
Netherlands. 
 
III. COUNTRY ACTIONS AGAINST DRUGS IN 2004. 
 
POLICY INITIATIVES. Spanish policy on drugs is directed by 
the PND, which covers the years 2000 to 2008. The strategy, 
approved in 1999, expanded the scope of law enforcement 
activities, such as permitting sale of seized assets in 
advance of a conviction and allowing law enforcement to use 
informers. The strategy also outlined a system to reintegrate 
individuals who have overcome drug addictions into Spanish 
society. The strategy also targets money laundering and 
illicit commerce in chemical precursors, and calls for closer 
counter-narcotics cooperation with other European and Latin 
American countries. Following a review of the demand side of 
the PND in July 2004, the Government agreed to restructure 
the PND by placing its harm reduction unit under the 
authority of the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health 
was particularly concerned about drug use among school 
children following a nationwide survey it conducted on drug 
use among 25,500 Spanish children aged 14 to 18. In 
September, officials revealed that the survey showed that 
within the last twelve months 36.1% of Spanish school 
children said they had used cannabis (double the percentage 
reported in 1995); 6.8% had taken cocaine; and less than one 
percent had tried heroin. In November, a European Union 
annual report on narcotics revealed that Spain was the top 
consumer of cocaine and cannabis in Europe. On drug supply, 
the Government placed its policymaking unit in the PSD under 
the competency of a new Department of Security within the 
Ministry of Interior to coordinate its policy agenda with 
counter-narcotic enforcement agencies.  Officials have stated 
that it would consider additional revisions to the PND before 
it is comprehensively reviewed in 2008. 
 
The National Central Drug Unit coordinates counter-narcotics 
operations among various government agencies, including the 
Spanish National Guard, the Spanish National Police, and the 
Customs Service.  Their cooperation appears to function well. 
 There is no evidence of corruption of senior officials or 
their involvement in the drug trade. 
 
In 2003, Spain and Portugal signed a Treaty of Cooperation to 
prevent drug consumption and to control the illegal 
trafficking of controlled substances. The Treaty establishes 
a joint \"Hispano-Portuguese Commission\" to exchange 
information, to coordinate intelligence gathering and 
professional training efforts. 
 
LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS 
 
Spanish officials at the Ministry of Interior reported 
October 26 that drug enforcement agencies seized 23,000 kg of 
cocaine, 223 kg of heroin, 531,000 kg of hashish, and 622,000 
units of MDMA between January and August 2004. Exact 
interdiction statistics based on comprehensive data collected 
by the Civil Guard and Spanish Customs Agency will not be 
available, however, until March 2005. 
 
The following are some notable cocaine seizures in 2004. On 
February 12, 2004, the Guardia Civil and the Spanish Customs 
Service discovered 5,735 kg of cocaine aboard the fishing 
vessel \"Lugo\" in Galicia. Seven Colombian nationals were 
arrested in this incident. On April 24, Spanish authorities 
interdicted a British-flagged sailing ship, the \"Diaosa Maat\" 
that contained 2,700 kg of cocaine. On March 27, the Spanish 
National Police interdicted a ship in the Port of Valencia 
carrying 3,280 kg of cocaine. On December 1, police officials 
discovered 3,100 kg aboard the \"White Sands\" shipping vessels 
in Galicia. They arrested 24 individuals including 11 
Colombian nationals. 
 
Although Spanish drug policy officials reported a decline in 
the number of interdictions of synthetic drugs, Spanish 
authorities seized large supplies of ecstasy. On July 22, 
Spanish national police seized nine kilograms of MDMA powder 
(approximately 180,000 pills) in the luggage of a Spanish 
passenger at Madrid\'s international airport. On September 1, 
the police arrested a Spanish passenger en route to the 
United States who was carrying 39,100 MDMA tablets at the 
Barcelona international airport. On August 18, police 
interdicted 41,000 MDMA pills carried by a Spanish passenger 
traveling to Puerto Rico. On December 1, Spanish police 
arrested a major international ecstasy dealer, Hank Romi, in 
Malaga by using information provided by the Madrid Country 
Office. 
 
On July 7, the Guardia Civil discovered laboratories in three 
apartments in Madrid containing chemical materials used to 
produce cocaine. Eleven Colombian nationals were arrested in 
connection with the incident. Authorities also arrested a 
Romanian passenger in possession of 6.3 kg of heroin. The 
Spanish National Police interdicted 70 kg of heroin in Toledo 
on July 21. 
 
Hashish trafficking appears to be particularly acute in the 
region of Catalonia and in the Costa del Sol (Sun Coast) in 
the province of Malaga. Drug enforcement officials have 
estimated that they captured 40,000 kg of hashish in drug 
raids in Barcelona, Tarragon, and Levante in 2004. 
Authorities in Malaga reported that they captured 21,813 
kilograms and arrested 490 persons for drug-related crimes in 
2004. Officials have acknowledged that hashish traffickers, 
primarily from North Africa, now use the coast of Catalonia 
more frequently than Spain\'s southern coast as an entry point 
for their trade because there are fewer counter-narcotic 
patrols along Catalonia\'s coast and along its border with 
France, where drugs can be more efficiently transported to 
other parts of Europe by road. 
 
Some notable hashish interdictions include the capture of 
3,030 kg of hashish in the Deletebre in Catalonia on March 
21. Police arrest arrested seven individuals in this 
incident.  On September 7, Spanish counter-narcotics agents 
captured 1,100 kg of hashish in Guadalquivir in Sevilla. 
Police arrested eight Spanish citizens in the incident. On 
December 3, counter-narcotics agents captured 4,100 kg of 
hashish and arrested 27 nationals of France, Romania, 
Albania, Morocco, and Algeria in a nationwide drug 
investigation. Officials determined that those arrested were 
members of a narcotics mafia based in Marseilles. 
 
AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES. Spain is a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, and all of the convention\'s articles are applied 
in Spain.  Spain is also a party to the 1990 Strasbourg 
Convention. Spain signed the UN Convention Against 
International Organized Crime and its protocols in 2000. A 
1970 extradition treaty and its three supplements govern 
extradition between the U.S. and Spain. The U.S.-Spain Mutual 
Legal Assistance Treaty has been in force since 1993. The 
U.S. and Spain have also signed a Customs Mutual Assistance 
Agreement. On December 17, Spain and the United States signed 
an additional MLAT on judicial assistance that will 
facilitate further mutual cooperation on drug trafficking 
cases. 
 
Spain is a party to European Conventions on Mutual Assistance 
in Criminal Matters, Extradition, the Transfer of Proceedings 
in Criminal Matters and the International Validity of 
Criminal Judgments. Spain has mutual legal assistance 
treaties or bilateral counter-narcotics agreements with most 
countries in Latin America, as well as with Morocco, Israel 
and Turkey. Spain approved March 14, 2003, the European 
Union-wide common arrest and detention order, which 
facilitates the transfer of prisoners and suspects among EU 
states. This law took effect on January 1, 2004. 
 
Spain is a member of the UNDCP major donors group and the 
Dublin group. Spain also chairs the regional Dublin group for 
Central America and Mexico.  Spain also funds programs 
through the Organization of American States\' Inter-American 
Drug Abuse Control Commission. Spain pledged USD 100 million 
to support Plan Colombia in 2003 and has pledged to continue 
to support the program in the coming years.  Spanish aid is 
targeted towards institutional strengthening of police and 
judicial forces, alternative development, and demand 
reduction. Spain sponsors numerous training courses for 
police and judicial authorities in Latin America and Morocco. 
 
CULTIVATION/PRODUCTION. Coca leaf is not cultivated in Spain, 
and cannabis is grown in insignificant quantities. For 
example, on August 27, police officials arrested the owner of 
a farm in Oviedo where they located 28 mature marijuana 
plants, 250 grams of dried marijuana plants, and a small 
amount of hashish. Opium poppy is cultivated under strictly 
regulated conditions for research. Refining and manufacturing 
of cocaine and synthetic drugs is minimal, with some 
small-scale laboratories converting cocaine base to cocaine 
hydrochloride. 
 
DRUG FLOW/TRANSIT. Spain is the major gateway to Europe for 
cocaine coming from Columbia, Peru, and Ecuador. Traffickers 
exploit Spain\'s close historic and linguistic ties with Latin 
America and its long southern coastline to transport drugs 
for consumption in Spain or distribution in other parts of 
Europe. Maritime vessel and containerized cargo shipments 
account for the bulk of the cocaine shipped to Spain. Spain 
remains a major transit point to Europe for hashish from 
Morocco; Spain\'s North African enclaves of Ceuta and Mellila 
are principle points of departure. Police officials 
acknowledge that traffickers are beginning to abandon 
traditional drug trade routes between the Strait of Gibraltar 
and the coasts of Huelva, Cadiz, Malaga, and Almeria, and are 
delivering hashish and other narcotics, to points along the 
coasts of Alicante, Valencia, Castellon de la Plana and 
Barcelona, where counter-narcotic sea patrols are less 
frequent. Spain\'s international airports in Madrid and 
Barcelona are a transit point for passengers who intend to 
traffic ecstasy and other synthetic drugs, mainly produced in 
the Netherlands, to the United States. These couriers, 
however, are typically captured before they leave Spain or 
when they arrive in the U.S. 
 
DOMESTIC PROGRAMS. The national drug strategy identifies 
prevention as its principal priority. In that regard, PND 
continued its publicity efforts targeting Spanish youth. 
Spain\'s autonomous communities provide treatment programs for 
drug addicts, including methadone programs and needle 
exchanges. Prison rehabilitation programs also distribute 
methadone. The Government has also provided approximately 4.1 
million euros to assist private, non-governmental 
organizations that carry out drug prevention and 
rehabilitation programs. 
 
IV. U.S. POLICY INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS. U.S. goals and 
objectives for Spain are focused on maintaining and 
increasing the current excellent bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation in law enforcement and demand reduction. We seek 
to promote intensified contacts between officials of both 
countries involved in counter-narcotics and related fields. 
Latin America remains an important area for counter-narcotics 
cooperation. Spanish officials are working closely with the 
Narcotics Affairs Section in Peru and Bolivia. 
 
THE ROAD AHEAD. The U.S. will continue to coordinate closely 
with Spanish counter-narcotics officials though the Madrid 
Country Office. Spain will continue to be a key player in the 
international fight against drug trafficking.

SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL STRATEGY REPORT 
2004: SPAIN 
 
REF: STATE 254401 
 
I. SUMMARY: In 2004, Spain continued its efforts to enforce 
the 1988 UN Drug Convention as well as other EU conventions 
on counter narcotics trafficking. Spanish National Police, 
the Guardia Civil and Customs Services interdicted record 
amounts of cocaine, hashish, and heroin and performed 
numerous enforcement operations throughout Spain to arrest 
distributors of synthetic drugs, such as LSD and ecstasy. 
However, officials have acknowledged that Spain continued to 
be a significant transit point and top consumer of cocaine 
and hashish in Europe. This issue prompted the newly elected 
Socialist government to restructure its drug policy 
coordination body, the National Drug Plan (PND), by assigning 
responsibility of its harm reduction unit to the Ministry of 
Health and its supply reduction unit to a new Department of 
Security within the Ministry of Interior. The GOS ranks drug 
trafficking as one of its most important law enforcement 
concerns, and has continued to maintain excellent relations 
with U.S. law enforcement. Cooperation between GOS and USG 
officials on Spain\'s domestic narcotic efforts and joint 
enforcement efforts in Latin America is a top policy 
objective of the new Spanish government. 
 
II. STATUS OF COUNTRY. 
 
Spain remains a principal gateway for cocaine transported 
from Latin American countries, such as Columbia and 
Venezuela, or transshipped from West Africa through Morocco. 
Spanish police continue to seize large amounts of Moroccan 
hashish along Spain\'s southern coast, some of which is 
trafficked by illegal immigrants. The majority of heroin that 
arrives in Spain is transported via the Balkan route from 
Turkey.  No coca is grown in Spain, and production of 
cannabis and opium is minimal. Illicit refining and 
manufacturing of drugs in Spain is also minimal although 
small-scale laboratories of synthetic drugs such as LSD are 
discovered and confiscated each year. Spain has a 
pharmaceutical industry that produces precursor chemicals. 
There is effective control of precursor shipments within 
Spain from the point of origin to destination, administered 
under the PND. Spain is a transit point to the U.S. for 
ecstasy and other synthetic drugs produced mainly in the 
Netherlands. 
 
III. COUNTRY ACTIONS AGAINST DRUGS IN 2004. 
 
POLICY INITIATIVES. Spanish policy on drugs is directed by 
the PND, which covers the years 2000 to 2008. The strategy, 
approved in 1999, expanded the scope of law enforcement 
activities, such as permitting sale of seized assets in 
advance of a conviction and allowing law enforcement to use 
informers. The strategy also outlined a system to reintegrate 
individuals who have overcome drug addictions into Spanish 
society. The strategy also targets money laundering and 
illicit commerce in chemical precursors, and calls for closer 
counter-narcotics cooperation with other European and Latin 
American countries. Following a review of the demand side of 
the PND in July 2004, the Government agreed to restructure 
the PND by placing its harm reduction unit under the 
authority of the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health 
was particularly concerned about drug use among school 
children following a nationwide survey it conducted on drug 
use among 25,500 Spanish children aged 14 to 18. In 
September, officials revealed that the survey showed that 
within the last twelve months 36.1% of Spanish school 
children said they had used cannabis (double the percentage 
reported in 1995); 6.8% had taken cocaine; and less than one 
percent had tried heroin. In November, a European Union 
annual report on narcotics revealed that Spain was the top 
consumer of cocaine and cannabis in Europe. On drug supply, 
the Government placed its policymaking unit in the PSD under 
the competency of a new Department of Security within the 
Ministry of Interior to coordinate its policy agenda with 
counter-narcotic enforcement agencies.  Officials have stated 
that it would consider additional revisions to the PND before 
it is comprehensively reviewed in 2008. 
 
The National Central Drug Unit coordinates counter-narcotics 
operations among various government agencies, including the 
Spanish National Guard, the Spanish National Police, and the 
Customs Service.  Their cooperation appears to function well. 
 There is no evidence of corruption of senior officials or 
their involvement in the drug trade. 
 
In 2003, Spain and Portugal signed a Treaty of Cooperation to 
prevent drug consumption and to control the illegal 
trafficking of controlled substances. The Treaty establishes 
a joint \"Hispano-Portuguese Commission\" to exchange 
information, to coordinate intelligence gathering and 
professional training efforts. 
 
LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS 
 
Spanish officials at the Ministry of Interior reported 
October 26 that drug enforcement agencies seized 23,000 kg of 
cocaine, 223 kg of heroin, 531,000 kg of hashish, and 622,000 
units of MDMA between January and August 2004. Exact 
interdiction statistics based on comprehensive data collected 
by the Civil Guard and Spanish Customs Agency will not be 
available, however, until March 2005. 
 
The following are some notable cocaine seizures in 2004. On 
February 12, 2004, the Guardia Civil and the Spanish Customs 
Service discovered 5,735 kg of cocaine aboard the fishing 
vessel \"Lugo\" in Galicia. Seven Colombian nationals were 
arrested in this incident. On April 24, Spanish authorities 
interdicted a British-flagged sailing ship, the \"Diaosa Maat\" 
that contained 2,700 kg of cocaine. On March 27, the Spanish 
National Police interdicted a ship in the Port of Valencia 
carrying 3,280 kg of cocaine. On December 1, police officials 
discovered 3,100 kg aboard the \"White Sands\" shipping vessels 
in Galicia. They arrested 24 individuals including 11 
Colombian nationals. 
 
Although Spanish drug policy officials reported a decline in 
the number of interdictions of synthetic drugs, Spanish 
authorities seized large supplies of ecstasy. On July 22, 
Spanish national police seized nine kilograms of MDMA powder 
(approximately 180,000 pills) in the luggage of a Spanish 
passenger at Madrid\'s international airport. On September 1, 
the police arrested a Spanish passenger en route to the 
United States who was carrying 39,100 MDMA tablets at the 
Barcelona international airport. On August 18, police 
interdicted 41,000 MDMA pills carried by a Spanish passenger 
traveling to Puerto Rico. On December 1, Spanish police 
arrested a major international ecstasy dealer, Hank Romi, in 
Malaga by using information provided by the Madrid Country 
Office. 
 
On July 7, the Guardia Civil discovered laboratories in three 
apartments in Madrid containing chemical materials used to 
produce cocaine. Eleven Colombian nationals were arrested in 
connection with the incident. Authorities also arrested a 
Romanian passenger in possession of 6.3 kg of heroin. The 
Spanish National Police interdicted 70 kg of heroin in Toledo 
on July 21. 
 
Hashish trafficking appears to be particularly acute in the 
region of Catalonia and in the Costa del Sol (Sun Coast) in 
the province of Malaga. Drug enforcement officials have 
estimated that they captured 40,000 kg of hashish in drug 
raids in Barcelona, Tarragon, and Levante in 2004. 
Authorities in Malaga reported that they captured 21,813 
kilograms and arrested 490 persons for drug-related crimes in 
2004. Officials have acknowledged that hashish traffickers, 
primarily from North Africa, now use the coast of Catalonia 
more frequently than Spain\'s southern coast as an entry point 
for their trade because there are fewer counter-narcotic 
patrols along Catalonia\'s coast and along its border with 
France, where drugs can be more efficiently transported to 
other parts of Europe by road. 
 
Some notable hashish interdictions include the capture of 
3,030 kg of hashish in the Deletebre in Catalonia on March 
21. Police arrest arrested seven individuals in this 
incident.  On September 7, Spanish counter-narcotics agents 
captured 1,100 kg of hashish in Guadalquivir in Sevilla. 
Police arrested eight Spanish citizens in the incident. On 
December 3, counter-narcotics agents captured 4,100 kg of 
hashish and arrested 27 nationals of France, Romania, 
Albania, Morocco, and Algeria in a nationwide drug 
investigation. Officials determined that those arrested were 
members of a narcotics mafia based in Marseilles. 
 
AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES. Spain is a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, and all of the convention\'s articles are applied 
in Spain.  Spain is also a party to the 1990 Strasbourg 
Convention. Spain signed the UN Convention Against 
International Organized Crime and its protocols in 2000. A 
1970 extradition treaty and its three supplements govern 
extradition between the U.S. and Spain. The U.S.-Spain Mutual 
Legal Assistance Treaty has been in force since 1993. The 
U.S. and Spain have also signed a Customs Mutual Assistance 
Agreement. On December 17, Spain and the United States signed 
an additional MLAT on judicial assistance that will 
facilitate further mutual cooperation on drug trafficking 
cases. 
 
Spain is a party to European Conventions on Mutual Assistance 
in Criminal Matters, Extradition, the Transfer of Proceedings 
in Criminal Matters and the International Validity of 
Criminal Judgments. Spain has mutual legal assistance 
treaties or bilateral counter-narcotics agreements with most 
countries in Latin America, as well as with Morocco, Israel

Union-wide common arrest and detention order, which 
facilitates the transfer of prisoners and suspects among EU 
states. This law took effect on January 1, 2004. 
 
Spain is a member of the UNDCP major donors group and the 
Dublin group. Spain also chairs the regional Dublin group for 
Central America and Mexico.  Spain also funds programs 
through the Organization of American States\' Inter-American 
Drug Abuse Control Commission. Spain pledged USD 100 million

SUBJECT: LOCAL NGO PRESSURES SPAIN ON CUBA HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
Classified By: Political officer Ricardo Zuniga; reason 1.4 (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  On 12/21, Poloff met with Rafael Rubio, head 
of the Spanish NGO \"Cuba en Transicion\" (Cuba in Transition), 
a human rights organization dedicated to raising public 
awareness in Spain about human rights abuses in Cuba.  Rubio, 
who generally works with the Popular Party (PP) but has also 
sought to expand his links to the Socialist Party, said that 
his organization is pressing the GOS to take concrete 
measures in support of Cuban civil society, \"since the only 
concrete measure they\'ve taken so far is to exclude 
dissidents from national day events.\"  Rubio said that, 
despite public claims of a victory for Spanish policy in 
Brussels, the GOS has opened the door for NGOs such as his to 
lobby for higher-profile EU support for the Cuban opposition. 
 He has made little headway with Socialist Party leaders, 
some of whom cling to a romantic vision of the Cuban 
revolution, and is now focused on influencing the MFA.  Rubio 
said he is perplexed by the UK\'s support for easing EU 
measures against Cuba and asked about the importance of Cuba 
in GOS-USG relations.  Poloff responded that Cuba is an 
important issue at the highest levels of the USG and that 
Spain\'s change in tack towards the GOS over the last year had 
not helped bilateral ties.  Rubio\'s organization is small, 
but working with allied NGOs, it may manage to rein in 
Socialist desires to further ease Spanish and EU policy 
towards Cuba.  End Summary. 
 
//PREACHING TO THE UN-CONVERTED// 
 
2. (C) Cuba in Transition is a small, but well-connected NGO 
(www.cubaentransicion.com) that is unusual in that it has no 
Cuban exiles in its membership.  It receives a small USAID 
grant through the Washington-based Center for a Free Cuba. 
Rubio said he has attempted to work through the Socialist 
Party (PSOE) before approaching the government.  His 
objective is to sensitize PSOE to the massive scale of Cuba\'s 
repression in an effort to eliminate a lingering sense of 
political affinity for Castro among some elements of the 
Socialist Party.  He has made little headway, primarily 
because the PSOE remains wary of publicly criticizing the 
Castro regime and because the Socialists have determined that 
so-called \"moderate\" dissidents Gutierrez Menoyo and Manuel 
Cuesta Morua are the only dissidents worth listening to. 
Rubio said the \"moderates\'\" message of working with the 
Castro regime to encourage gradual change was seductive to EU 
left wing parties such as the PSOE (NOTE: PSOE has brushed 
aside dissident suspicions that Cuesta Morua is in fact a 
Cuban Government agent. END NOTE.)  Rubio said he was taken 
aback to hear PSOE members criticize Project Varela leader 
Oswaldo Paya as \"too conservative\" and as \"a tool of the 
Miami exile community,\" especially given Paya\'s well-known 
differences with Miami groups.  This echoes PSOE comments to 
a visiting National Democratic Institute representative that 
Paya\'s anti-abortion stance and good relations with former 
President Aznar had alienated the PSOE. 
 
3. (C) Rubio said he had inundated Spanish Ambassador to Cuba 
Carlos Saldivar with information regarding GOC abuses for 
many months.  He believed he had managed to at least get 
Saldivar, a former Spanish Communist Party member, to 
question his preconceptions about Castro.  However, Rubio 
said Saldivar \"remains a Marxist in his basic world view\" and 
may be fundamentally incapable of conducting an objective 
evaluation of conditions in Cuba. 
 
//MAKING THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION// 
 
4. (C) Having determined that the PSOE is not likely to veer 
from its cautious stance towards aiding the opposition, 
Rubio has gone directly to the Socialist Government.  He 
recently approached the MFA to encourage them to take 
specific steps to comply with Spain\'s claim that it intends 
to ramp up contact with the dissidents to offset their 
dis-invitation from EU national day events.  Specifically, 
Rubio is urging the GOS to: 
 
- Raise the public profile of the regular EU-Cuban opposition 
exchanges the GOS has pledged to activate in Havana. 
 
- Create public space in the Spanish Embassy in Havana for 
civil society, similar to the USINT Havana media center. 
 
- Distribute books and information materials to Cuban 
citizens, including both political and non-political 
literature. 
 
- Create an official Spanish \"human rights officer\" position 
in Havana to act as a POC for democracy activists and for 
human rights NGOs overseas. 
 
5. (C) Rubio said he had told MFA DG for Latin America Javier 
Sandomingo that the opposition could not accept having its 
relations with the EU downgraded, since this implied that 
Europe did not consider the activists to be legitimate 
political actors.  Rubio asked Sandomingo to support a human 
rights conference he is trying to organize in Madrid two days 
prior to the January 31 review/approval by EU foreign 
ministers of the COLAT experts recommendation to modify the 
EU restrictive measures.  The goal of the conference would be 
to provide concrete recommendations to the EU on how to 
structure assistance to Cuban civil society, based on the 
EU\'s experience supporting democracy activists in other 
countries. 
 
//INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT// 
 
6. (C) Rubio expressed his consternation that the UK had 
\"turned its back\" on Cuba\'s human rights activists, saying it 
was inconceivable to him that a country with the UK\'s 
tradition of support for human rights would have agreed to 
weaken EU measures against the GOC given the lack of progress 
in Cuba.  With respect to the U.S., he asked whether the Cuba 
issue was a genuinely important issue in bilateral relations 
with Spain.  Poloff replied that Cuba was a very important 
matter to the USG and that we were very skeptical regarding 
Spain\'s current approach.  While we have good working 
relations with the GOS on many issues, Cuba developments were 
not helping the bilateral relationship. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
7. (C) Rubio\'s close association with the opposition PP 
complicates his efforts to influence the ruling Socialists. 
He is aware of this and focuses on basic human rights issues 
in order to avoid becoming ensnarled in the politics 
surrounding Spanish policy towards Cuba.  Cuba in Transition 
is a small organization with limited objectives, but its 
members are genuinely committed to the issues and are capable 
of keeping Cuba human rights in the public eye.  The best we 
may be able to hope for over the near term is that activists 
such as Rubio will manage to keep alive the domestic debate 
over Cuba policy, preventing the GOS from going too far in 
easing pressure on Castro.

SUBJECT: VISIT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ASHCROFT FOR MLAT SIGNING 
 
Classified By: Classified by Charge d\'Affairs, a.i., Bob Manzanares; re 
asons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Attorney General John Ashcroft visited Spain 
on December 17 to sign the bilateral protocols to the U.S.-EU 
Mutual Legal Assistance (MLAT) and Extradition Treaty. 
During his one-day visit, Attorney General Ashcroft also held 
separate meetings with the Minister of Justice and the 
Minister of Interior, primarily to discuss bilateral 
cooperation on terrorism investigations.  The MLAT signing 
ceremony and the press conference following the event went 
smoothly and received favorable press coverage.  During the 
bilateral meetings, GOS officials underscored their 
commitment to work with the USG to combat terrorism. 
Minister of the Interior Alonso expressed interest in 
visiting the U.S. in the next several months to meet U.S. 
counterterrorism experts.  Both the Minister of Justice and 
the Minister of Interior drew AG Ashcroft\'s attention to 
Spain\'s offer earlier in 2004 for talks on the possible 
formation of a joint GOS-USG counterterrorism investigative 
unit.  Their emphasis on the creation of a joint team seems 
to be based both on Spain\'s genuine desire to collaborate 
against a common menace and the Zapatero Government\'s 
political need to produce a tangible improvement in relations 
with the USG, preferably on a terrorism-related issue.  End 
Summary. 
 
//MLAT SIGNING AT MINISTRY OF JUSTICE// 
 
2. (U) The centerpiece of Attorney General Ashcroft\'s visit 
was the signing ceremony for the bilateral protocols to the 
U.S.-EU MLAT and Extradition Treaty.  The event took place at 
the Ministry of Justice, with Minister of Justice Juan 
Fernando Lopez Aguilar participating for the GOS.  The 
signing was followed by a short press conference, during 
which journalists requested details regarding the function of 
the MLAT, as well as more pointed questions regarding the 
state of USG-GOS relations.  Attorney General Ashcroft noted 
that the USG considered Spanish judicial assistance to be 
very beneficial and that the MLAT would deepen an already 
sound working relationship.  For the Spanish side, Minister 
Aguilar thanked Attorney General Ashcroft for the United 
States\' contribution to global security and the fight against 
crime and terrorism.\"  Both Attorney General Ashcroft and 
Minister Aguilar identified enhanced counterterrorism 
capabilities as their most important priority in seeking 
improved international judicial cooperation. 
 
3. (C) Following the MLAT signing Aguilar and his senior 
staff met with Attorney General Ashcroft, Charge d\'Affairs, 
senior members of Attorney General Ashcroft\'s delegation, and 
Legat to discuss concrete measures for improving the flow of 
law enforcement information in both directions.  Aguilar 
raised the offer by Spain\'s National Prosecutor to the USG 
for talks on the possible formation of a joint U.S.-Spanish 
team to investigate in terrorism investigations of mutual 
interest, with a focus on Islamic terrorism.  AG Ashcroft 
thanked Aguilar for the GOS offer and said that in the USG\'s 
view such joint team should have a broader scope, tackling 
the full range of terrorist threats. 
 
//MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR// 
 
4. (C) Following his meeting with Aguilar, Attorney General 
Ashcroft met with Minister of the Interior Jose Antonio 
Alonso.  Alonso said that fighting terrorism - both by ETA 
and by Muslim extremists - was among the highest priorities 
of the Zapatero Government.  Alsonso expressed Spain\'s desire 
to ramp up information exchanges and other forms of 
cooperation with the USG against terrorism.  He noted Spain\'s 
recent police successes against terrorists, listing the 
multiple arrests of Islamic radicals and ETA organizers over 
the last several months.  On ETA, Alonso said that assistance 
from abroad, including from U.S. sources in Nevada and 
California, remains an important source of support for the 
organization.  Like Aguilar, Alonso discussed Spain\'s offer 
of talks on the formation of a joint counterterrorism unit 
and urged the USG to take up the GOS suggestion.  Alonso said 
he would like to visit the U.S., perhaps in March or April, 
to meet with U.S. terrorism experts. 
 
5. (C) Attorney General Ashcroft welcomed a visit by Alonso, 
noting that he would be departing DOJ but that senior members 
of his delegation would remain and would be happy to help 
arrange Alonso\'s trip to the U.S. once the new Attorney 
General was in place.  Ashcroft said the USG is keenly aware 
of the burden Spain has borne over the last decades in its 
struggle against ETA and wanted to show its support, for 
example by having formally designated ETA as a terrorist 
organization.  Attorney General Ashcroft said Spain\'s caution 
with respect to recent ETA reverses was well warranted, 
particulary since he agreed with Spanish experts that 
weakened organizations could be the most dangerous.  He said 
the new MLAT and Extradition Treaty represented an important 
step forward in making the U.S. and Spain better partners, 
particularly the provisions that could facilitate the 
creation of joint teams. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
6. (C) Attorney General Ashcroft\'s visit was an important 
symbol of the USG\'s commitment to work with Spain against 
common security threats.  His meetings with the Ministers 
revealed that, at least among the security agencies, the GOS 
understands the nature of the terrorist threat and is eager 
to work with the USG to minimize that threat.  That partly 
explains Spain\'s emphasis on establishing a joint 
counterterrorism investigative unit with the USG, similar to 
a unit it has developed with France.  The GOS also has a 
vital political motive for creating such a unit: it would be 
concrete evidence of USG-GOS cooperation against terrorism, 
which Zapatero needs in order to counter opposition 
accusations that he has fatally damaged Spain\'s relations 
with Washington.  Regardless of the political context, we 
support holding talks on the creation of a joint 
counterterrorism unit as such discussions may help us resolve 
operational/procedural issues that have impeded judicial 
cooperation in the past.  Likewise, we recommend inviting 
Minister Alonso to visit Washington as early as would be 
practicable in order to cement an already positive 
relationship with Spain\'s most important security official.

REF: STATE 254401 
Money laundered in Spain is primarily from the proceeds of 
the Colombian cocaine trade, although money laundered 
through other Latin American countries also plays a role. 
Colombian organizations use several methods to move money 
from European drug sales out of Spain. Money is carried out 
by airline personnel traveling between Spain and Latin 
America.  Colombian companies purchase goods in Asia and 
sell the electronics at cartel run stores legally in Europe. 
Credit card balances are paid in Spanish banks for charges 
made in Latin America. Money deposited in Spanish banks is 
withdrawn by ATM cards in Colombia. Wire transfers continue 
to be a common way of getting money out of Spain. 
Drug proceeds from other regions enter Spain as well. 
Hashish proceeds from come from Morocco enter Spain as well 
asand some heroin money enters from Turkish smugglersTurkey. 
There is also some concern about the black market smuggling 
of goods to avoid taxation, especially tobacco and 
electronics from Gibraltar. The majority of laundered money 
that enters Spain to be laundered is smuggled across the 
border in three ways.  Bulkas bulk cash via individuals 
carrying cash in theiris carried in travelers\' luggage or 
hidden on their travelers\' bodies when arriving at 
international airports. Shipping ; containers loaded with 
currency entering  the largerthrough Spanish ports (such as 
Algeciras). Money is also ; and money smuggled brought in by 
small craft along Spain\'s long the coastline. 
Money also enters and leaves Spain through the commercial 
banking system andThe informal nonbank outlets (such as 
\"Locutorios\"), which make small international transfers for 
the immigrant community continue to be used to move money in 
and out of Spain. Regulators also suspect the presence of 
\"hawala\" like networks in the Islamic community, 
Tax evasion in internal markets and smuggling of goods along 
the coastline continue to be a source of illicit funds in 
Spain.  Spanish authorities believe that tax evasion in the 
cell phone and property industries are the most serious 
problems. The smuggling of electronics and tobacco from 
Gibraltar remains an ongoing issue. 
Although little of the money laundered in Spain is believed 
to be used for terrorist financing, money from the extortion 
of businesses in the Basque region is moved through the 
financial system and used to finance the Basque terrorist 
group ETA. 
The Spanish government is Spain is aware of all of these the 
problems. Unfortunately the scale of the money laundering 
industry and the sophisticated methods use create a very 
large law enforcement problem. The government makes every 
effort to eliminate financial crime in Spain; however the 
money is difficult to track. 
There have been no cases of Spanish officials involved in 
money laundering in Spain. 
The Government of Spain (GOS) remains committed to combating 
narcotics trafficking, terrorism, and financial crimes, and 
continues to work hard to tighten financial controls. The 
criminalization of money laundering was added to the penal 
code in 1988 when laundering the proceeds from narcotics 
trafficking was made a criminal offense. In 1995 the law was 
expanded to cover all serious crimes that required a prison 
sentence greater than three years. All forms of money 
laundering were made financial crimes in amendments to the 
code on November 25, 2003, which will take effect on October 
1, 2004. 
The penal code can also apply to individuals in financial 
firms if their institutions have been used for financial 
crimes. An amendment to the penal code in 1991 made such 
persons culpable for both fraudulent acts and negligence 
connected with money laundering. 
Businesses and financial service suppliers operating in 
Spain or targeting Spanish markets are subject to a newthe 
law, Ley de Servicios de la Sociedad de Informacion y de 
Comercio Electronico (LSSICE), that came into force on 
October 12, 2002, for Internet marketing and distribution. 
The new law requires businesses to register their domain 
names, company registry, physical address, and other company 
details. Financial sector businesses such as online banks 
must still send written contracts to new customers for 
signature and obtain physical proof of their identity, in 
order to comply with existing banking regulations. 
Royal Decree 998/2003 of July 5, 2003 modified the structure 
of the Ministry of Interior to facilitate more active 
combating of drug trafficking. This law creates an Advisory 
Committee on Observation that will attempt to follow the use 
of technologies by criminal organizations and money 
launderers and take measures to ensure that Spanish law 
enforcement authorities are able to meet the new challenges. 
Specific measures to prevent money laundering were written 
to regulate the legal entities in the financial sector and 
individuals moving large sums of cash, in December 1993 (Law 
No. 19/1993), as an expansion to the criminal code whichcode 
that previously applied only to physical persons. The 
regulations for enactment were established by Royal Decree 
925/1995, which set the standards for regulation of the 
financial system. The regulations were amended in 2003 and 
cover money laundering linked to illicit drugs, terrorism, 
and organized crime. The financial sector is required to 
identify customers, keep records of transactions, and report 
suspicious financial transactions. The money laundering law 
applies to most entities active in the financial system, 
including banks, mutual savings associations, credit 
companies, insurance companies, financial advisers, 
brokerage and securities firms, postal services, currency 
exchange outlets, casinos, and individuals and unofficial 
financial institutions exchanging or transmitting money 
(alternative remittance systems). The 2003 amendments add 
lawyers and notaries as covered entities. Previously, 
notaries and lawyers were required to report suspicious 
cases, but now they are considered part of the financial 
system that is under the supervision of appropriate 
regulators. 
Law 19/2003 obligates financial institutions to make monthly 
reports on large transactions. Banks are required to report 
all international transfers greater than 30,000 euros. The 
law also requires the declaration and reporting of internal 
transfers of funds greater than 80,500 euros. 
In addition to suspicious transactions, individuals 
traveling internationally are required to report the 
importation or exportation of currency greater than 6,000 
euros. Previously, the Spanish authorities could only keep 
12 percent if they uncovered illegal activity, but had to 
return the remainder with a Bank of Spain check, which 
effectively laundered the money. Law 19/2003 increases 
allows the seizure of up to 100 percent if illegal activity 
under financial crimes ordinances can be proven. Spanish 
authorities claim they have seen a drop in cash carriers 
since the law\'s enactment in July 2003. For cases where the 
money can not be connected to criminal activity, but it 
alsoand has not been declared, the authorities may keep 
between 25 and 100 percent, depending on the amount of the 
currency being carried. 
The Commission for the Prevention of Money Laundering and 
Financial Crimes (CPBC) coordinates the fight against money 
laundering in Spain. The Secretary of State for Economy 
heads the commission and all of the agencies involved in the 
prevention of money laundering participate. The 
representatives include the National Drug Plan Office, the 
Ministry of Economy, the Federal Prosecutors (Fiscalia), 
Customs, the Spanish National Police, the Guardia Civil, 
CNMV (equivalent to the SEC), the Treasury, the Bank of 
Spain, and the Director General of Insurance and Pension 
Funds. Any member of the Commission may request an 
investigation, should suspicious activity be brought to his 
or her attention. 
The CPBC delegates responsibility to two additional 
organizations. The first is a secretariat in the Treasury, 
located in the Ministry of Economy. Following investigation 
and a guilty verdict by a court, this regulating body 
carries out penalties. Sanctions can include closure, fines, 
account freezes, or seizures of assets. Changes in Law 
19/2003 now allows seizures of assets of third parties in 
criminal transactions, and a seizure of real estate in an 
amount equivalent to the illegal profit. One weakness that 
remains in financial sanctions is that the joint owner may 
access joint accounts if he or she can show financial need. 
The second organization is the Executive Service of the 
Commission for the Prevention of Money Laundering (SEPBLAC), 
which serves as Spain\'s financial intelligence unit. SEPBLAC 
receives and analyzes suspicious activity reports (SARs) and 
currency transaction reports. SEPBLAC has the primary 
responsibility for any investigation in money laundering 
cases and directly supervises the anti-money laundering 
procedures of banks and financial institutions. 
Incriminating information is turned over to the Federal 
Prosecutors for prosecution. Spanish banks are required by 
law to maintain fiscal information for five years and 
mercantile records for six years. 
The Fund of Seized Goods of Narcotics Traffickers receives 
seized assets. This agency was established under the 
National Drug Plan. The proceeds from the funds are divided, 
with half going to drug treatment programs and half to a 
foundation that supports the officers fighting narcotics 
trafficking. 
Terrorist financing issues are governed by a separate code 
of law and commission, the Commission of Vigilance of 
Terrorist Finance Activities (CVAFT). This commission was 
created under Law 12/2003 on the Prevention and Blocking of 
the Financing of Terrorism. The commission is headed by the 
Ministry of Interior and includes representatives from the 
Fiscalia and Ministries of Justice and Economy. Currently, 
only the head of CVAFT can request information in terrorist 
financing cases, so other members must rely on the 
commission head to begin an investigation. 
Crimes of terrorism are defined in Article 571 of the Penal 
Code, and penalties are set forth in Articles 572 and 574. 
Sanctions range from ten to thirty years\' imprisonment with 
longer terms if the terrorist actions were directed against 
government officials. The Spanish are more active in 
freezing terrorist accounts, than drug money laundering 
accounts. Their ability to freeze accounts in the most 
recent law is more aggressive than that of most of their 
European counterparts. Though many laws are transposed from 
EU directives, Law 12/2003 goes beyond EU requirements. 
However, the implementing regulations for this law have not 
been written, and it has not been used. Once in full effect, 
this law will allow administrative freezing of suspect 
assets without a judge\'s order. 
All legal charities are placed on a register maintained by 
the Ministry of Justice. Responsibility for policing 
registered charities lies with the Ministry of Public 
Administration. If the charity fails to comply with the 
requirements, sanctions or other criminal charges may be 
levied. 
Spain is a member of the FATF, and co-chairs the FATF 
terrorist finance working group. Spain is a participating 
and cooperating nation to the South American Financial 
Action Task Force (GAFISUD), and a cooperating and 
supporting nation to the Caribbean Financial Action Task 
Force (CFATF). Spain is a major provider of counterterrorism 
assistance. The GOS ratified the UN Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime on March 2, 2002, and the UN 
International Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism on April 9, 2002. Spain is also a 
party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. SEPBLAC is a member of 
the Egmont Group. 
The GOS has signed criminal mutual legal assistance 
agreements with Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the 
Dominican Republic, Mexico, Morocco, Uruguay, and the United 
States. Spain\'s Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the 
United States has been in effect since 1993. Spain also has 
entered into bilateral agreements for cooperation and 
information exchange on money laundering issues with 
Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador, France, Israel, Italy, Malta, 
Mexico, Panama, Portugal, Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, 
Uruguay, and the United States. Spain actively collaborates 
with Europol, supplying and exchanging information on 
terrorist groups. In 2003, U.S. law enforcement authorities 
cooperated with the GOS in an investigation that resulted in 
the seizure of over $10 million in cash, jewelry, planes, 
and real estate. 
U.S. law enforcement agencies reported excellent cooperation 
with their Spanish counterparts in 2004.  U.S. customs works 
closely with Spanish customs, Spanish prosecutors, the 
national police corps and the Civil Guard.  The Drug 
Enforcement Administration works closely with SEPBLAC, the 
national police and the Civil Guard. These organizations 
regularly share information. Official documents however, 
will only be transferred if requested by a court. 
Seizures of assets involving more than one country and the 
division of the assets depend on the relationship with the 
third country. EU working groups will determine how to 
divide the proceeds for member countries. Outside of the EU, 
bilateral commissions are formed with countries that are 
members of FATF, FATF-like bodies and the Egmont Group, to 
deal with the division of seized assets. With other 
countries, negotiations are conducted on an ad hoc basis. 
The U.S.-Spain MLAT provides for sharing of seized assets, 
but the request must be made to the Spanish court hearing 
the case, rather than administratively.

1. Minister of Culture Carmen Calvo announced on 12/29/04 key 
aspects of the GOS\'s new \"Integrated Plan for the Reduction 
and Elimination of Activities Violating Intellectual 
Property\".  A draft of the plan has been provided to industry 
and other stakeholders who have until January 20 to provide 
comments.  The Culture Ministry has issued a press release 
with the Plan\'s major elements.  They include: 
 
a) The creation of an InterMinisterial Commission (11 
ministries are involved; private sector represenatives will 
also participate, although it is not clear if they will 
attend Commission meetings). 
 
b) Preventive actions against piracy (not enumerated). 
 
c) Public campaigns against piracy. 
 
d) Analysis of the efficacy of existing Spanish legislation. 
There is an emphasis on more effective police action, and the 
prosecution of street piracy. 
 
e) The establishment of mechanisms for training of officials 
involved in combatting intellectual property rights 
violations. 
 
2. The plan was welcomed by General Society of Authors and 
Writers (SGAE), the Record Company Association (AFIVE), the 
Association of Composers and Authors of Music (ACAM), the 
Artists Management Society of Spain (AIGE), the anti-piracy 
Roundtable, and various artists.  The local Business Software 
Alliance (BSA) representative told EconOff that this was a 
positive step.  He had discussed with Charge (reftel) the 
need for a French-style plan including all the relevant 
stakeholders to combat piracy, and industry seems to have 
gotten what it wanted. 
 
3. Comment: This initiative tracks with some of the copyright 
industry\'s desires (reftel), although the issue, as is 
usually the case with intellectual property protection, is to 
what extent good intentions are implemented. We will be 
consulting with the GOS and industry over the coming weeks 
and months regarding the propects for this plan.  With 
respect to possible USG assistance, we will continue to work 
with U.S. Customs and relevant Spanish authorities to see if 
there is interest in having a U.S. Customs official exchange 
experiences with Spanish authorities on how to track blank CD 
imports.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, PTER, SP, Basque Region 
SUBJECT: BASQUE PARLIAMENT APPROVES PLAN TO SEEK GREATER 
AUTONOMY 
 
1. (U) Summary.  The Basque Regional Parliament surprised 
Spanish political observers by narrowly approving a proposal 
by the ruling Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to seek 
increased autonomy from the national government.  Known as 
\"Plan Ibarretxe,\" the proposal falls short of calling for an 
independent Basque state, but would give the Basque 
Government near total authority within its territory, limited 
Basque representation at the international level, and 
official recognition of the Basque people as a separate 
nation.  Plan Ibarretxe was not expected to win the necessary 
majority in the Basque Parliament, but unexpected support by 
three deputies affiliated with the outlawed ETA political 
front group Batasuna carried the day for the Basque 
nationalists.  The plan now moves to the national Parliament 
for consideration.  If approved at the national level, voters 
in the Basque Region would have to approve or reject the plan 
via a referendum.  Both the ruling Socialists (PSOE) and the 
opposition Popular Party (PP) have signaled their intent to 
reject Plan Ibarretxe in Parliament, effectively vetoing 
further action on the PNV proposal.  However, the Basque 
Government claims it will follow through with a popular 
referendum on its plan regardless of the vote in Madrid, 
setting the stage for a major constitutional crisis. 
 
2. (SBU) President Zapatero has thus far ignored calls by the 
PP to terminate Plan Ibarretxe on legal grounds by bringing 
it before the Constitutional Court, calculating that by 
allowing the political process to play itself out he can 
undermine Basque nationalist claims that Madrid is intolerant 
and undemocratic.  The PSOE hopes to parlay Ibarretxe\'s 
defeat in the national Parliament into electoral gains during 
Basque Region elections in May.  The PNV, which is in a 
coalition with two small leftist parties, is likely to use a 
political defeat in Madrid to stoke nationalist sentiments as 
part of its effort to win an outright majority in the Basque 
legislature.  Apart from being an enormous political 
challenge for Zapatero, the passage of Plan Ibarretxe is 
likely to further widen the deep rift between Basque 
nationalists and Basque supporters of the current autonomy 
statutes.  End Summary. 
 
//PLAN IBARRETXE: SEEKING BASQUE \"FREE ASSOCIATION\" WITH 
SPAIN// 
 
3. (U) Plan Ibarretxe, named after its author, Basque 
Regional President Juan Jose Ibarretxe, does not call for the 
creation of an independent Basque state.  It is a call for 
the re-negotiation of the existing autonomy statute (the 
\"Statute of Gernika,\" negotiated during Spain\'s transition to 
democracy) to convert the Basque Region from an \"autonomous 
community\" such as Catalonia or Galicia into a region in 
\"free association\" with Spain.  It would enjoy near total 
autonomy on internal political and social matters, as well as 
limited representation at the international level. 
 
Key points include: 
 
- A definition of the Basque people as a \"nation\" residing in 
the nation-states of Spain and France. 
 
- The declaration that the Basque \"nation\" has the right of 
self-determination, based on consultation with the residents 
of Basque Country, Navarra, and Iparralde (French Basque 
region). 
 
- The recognition by Spanish and Basque authorities of both 
Spanish and Basque nationalities. 
 
- Increased Basque representation in EU institutions. 
 
- Control by the Basque Government over: education, tax 
collection, economic policy, health care, natural resources, 
and implementation of national (Spanish) laws. 
 
- The central government would retain control over: national 
defense, foreign policy, customs, control of airspace, and 
legal jurisdiction in criminal matters, intellectual property 
cases, and in the administration of civil law. 
 
//A SURPRISE VICTORY// 
 
4. (U) The conventional wisdom among political observers was 
that the PNV would fail to win a vote on Plan Ibarretxe in 
the Basque Parliament, but would then use that loss to 
challenge the nationalist credentials of its opponents in 
Basque elections in May.  This view was predicated on the 
fact that three deputies affiliated with the banned ETA 
political front group Batasuna had stated their opposition to 
Plan Ibarretxe as insufficient and unlikely to prevail in 
Madrid.  (NOTE: Batasuna was disbanded in 2002 under the Law 
of Political Parties, but Batasuna deputies in political 
assemblies were allowed to retain their seats as members of 
\"Sozialista Abertzaleak,\" which is simply another name for 
Batasuna.  END NOTE.)  However, Batasuna\'s support for Plan 
Ibarretxe in a procedural vote in early December raised 
suspicions that the PNV had secretly negotiated Batasuna\'s 
support for the key vote on December 30.  This was confirmed 
when the measure passed by a 39 to 35 vote after hours of 
emotional debate.  Batasuna leader Arnaldo Otegi said that he 
had backed Ibarretxe despite his personal misgivings because 
of \"the desire of the Basque people to be heard.\" 
 
5. (U) Under the terms of the current autonomy statute, Plan 
Ibarretxe now goes to the national Parliament to be debated 
and submitted to a vote.  The debate will likely begin in 
late February.  If the measure were approved at the national 
level, it would permit the Basque Government to organize a 
referendum on Plan Ibarretxe.  However, there is little 
chance Ibarretxe will reach this next step, since both the 
PSOE and the PP strongly oppose PNV efforts to increase the 
Basque Region\'s already considerable independence.  If the 
plan is rejected by the national Parliament, there is no 
recourse for the PNV and the project would have no legal 
standing.  However, Juan Jose Ibarretxe declared that Basque 
Government would proceed with a referendum regardless of 
whether the plan is approved or rejected in Madrid, arguing 
that it would be undemocratic to deny Basque voters the 
opportunity to determine the nature of their relationship 
with the GOS.  Calling a referendum without the approval of 
the national Parliament would be a criminal act punishable by 
imprisonment or other penalties. 
 
//NEGATIVE REACTIONS// 
 
6. (U) Both the PSOE and the PP responded to the passage of 
Plan Ibarretxe by reiterating their determination to preserve 
the existing autonomy statutes and attacking the PNV for 
accepting the support of Batasuna deputies who have refused 
to renounce ETA terrorism.  Basque President Ibarretxe 
retorted that he had accepted Batasuna\'s support for his plan 
just as the PP and PSOE would have accepted Batasuna\'s vote 
against the PNV proposal.  PP leaders called on the GOS to 
sidetrack Plan Ibarretxe before it reached Parliament by 
referring the matter to Spain\'s Constitutional Court, 
claiming Ibarretxe was secessionist and therefore 
unconstitutional.  Zapatero rejected the PP recommendation, 
saying his Government would refuse to negotiate with the PNV 
on the autonomy statutes, but would let Plan Ibarretxe 
proceed to the national Parliament in line with existing 
legal provisions. 
 
7. Although Zapatero agreed to meet Ibarretxe in early 
January, he said that the GOS would not agree to the 
\"government to government\" talks on Ibarretxe requested by 
the PNV.  He told journalists on January 1 that \"there is no 
space for this plan within the Spanish Constitution.  It is a 
thing of the past and should have been withdrawn long ago.\" 
GOS Minister for Public Administration Jordi Sevilla told 
journalists that the Government\'s aim is for \"the Basque 
people to defeat the plan themselves\" by rejecting the PNV in 
the May regional elections.  Zapatero thereby hopes to 
undermine Basque nationalist claims that the central 
government is both undemocratic in its actions and deaf to 
the legitimate aspirations of the Basque people.  However, 
Zapatero said the GOS would consider legal action if the 
Basque Government chose to proceed with a referendum after 
Plan Ibarretxe had been considered (and rejected) by the 
national Parliament.   Perhaps to show the Government\'s 
mettle, Attorney General Conde Pumpido announced that the GOS 
would pursue charges against Batasuna leaders, including 
Arnaldo Otegi, for organizing an \"illegal\" meeting of the 
group in November during which participants expressed support 
for dead or jailed ETA members. 
 
//A DANGEROUS COURSE// 
 
8. (SBU) This is the most significant domestic political 
crisis faced by Zapatero since he took office in April 2004. 
He is gambling that by giving the proposal a hearing in 
Parliament that Plan Ibarretxe will fail due to its legal and 
political contradictions without undue intervention on the 
part of the GOS.  However, if the PNV ignores the decision of 
the national Parliament and carries out a referendum on Plan 
Ibarretxe as threatened, it will present the GOS with a 
serious constitutional crisis and expose Zapatero to 
opposition recriminations that he should have acted more 
forcefully.  Moreover, the PNV\'s challenge to Madrid\'s 
central authority calls into question GOS plans to \"review\" 
and possibly reform autonomy statutes with other regions, a 
move widely interpreted as a GOS concession to PSOE-allied 
regionalist parties in Catalonia and elsewhere in Spain. 
 
9. (SBU) Basque civil society faces an even greater challenge 
than Zapatero.  With radical Batasuna openly backing an 
initiative of the moderate PNV, the divisions between Basque 
nationalists and their Basque \"consitutionalist\" opponents 
are greater than ever.  The Basque electorate is divided 
roughly in half between the two groups.  The 
constitutionalists believe that Batasuna\'s role in the 
approval of Plan Ibarretxe has exposed the PNV as apologists 
for violent radical nationalists and that Plan Ibarretxe is 
only the first step in a move toward eventual secession from 
Spain.  Already, PP leaders in the constitutionalist 
stronghold of Alava have said they would not accept the 
implementation of Plan Ibarretxe.  Meanwhile, the PNV argues 
that by coopting part of ETA\'s political message, it is 
siphoning off the terrorist\'s political support and drawing 
would-be radicals into the legitimate political arena.  The 
legal and political sparring over Plan Ibarretxe is likely to 
dominate the Spanish political scene through the May regional 
elections.

REF: STATE 254401 
 
Money laundered in Spain is primarily from the proceeds of the 
Colombian cocaine trade, although money laundered through other 
Latin American countries also plays a role. Colombian 
organizations use several methods to move money from European 
drug sales out of Spain. Money is carried out by airline 
personnel traveling between Spain and Latin America.  Colombian 
companies purchase goods in Asia and sell the electronics at 
cartel run stores legally in Europe. Credit card balances are 
paid in Spanish banks for charges made in Latin America. Money 
deposited in Spanish banks is withdrawn by ATM cards in 
Colombia. Wire transfers continue to be a common way of getting 
money out of Spain. 
 
Drug proceeds from other regions enter Spain as well. Hashish 
proceeds come from Morocco and heroin money enters from Turkey. 
 
The majority of money that enters Spain to be laundered is 
smuggled across the border in three ways.  Bulk cash is carried 
in travelers\' luggage or hidden on travelers\' bodies when 
arriving at international airports. Shipping containers loaded 
with currency enter through Spanish ports (such as Algeciras). 
Money is also brought in by small craft along Spain\'s long 
coastline. 
 
The informal nonbank outlets (such as \"Locutorios\"), which make 
small international transfers for the immigrant community 
continue to be used to move money in and out of Spain. 
Regulators also suspect the presence of \"hawala\" like networks 
in the Islamic community. 
 
Tax evasion in internal markets and smuggling of goods along the 
coastline continue to be a source of illicit funds in Spain. 
Spanish authorities believe that tax evasion in the cell phone 
and property industries are the most serious problems. The 
smuggling of electronics and tobacco from Gibraltar remains an 
ongoing issue. 
 
Although little of the money laundered in Spain is believed to 
be used for terrorist financing, money from the extortion of 
businesses in the Basque region is moved through the financial 
system and used to finance the Basque terrorist group ETA. 
 
The Spanish government is aware of all of these problems. 
Unfortunately the scale of the money laundering industry and the 
sophisticated methods used create a very large law enforcement 
problem. The government makes every effort to eliminate 
financial crime in Spain. 
 
There have been no cases of Spanish officials involved in money 
laundering in Spain. 
 
The Government of Spain (GOS) remains committed to combating 
narcotics trafficking, terrorism, and financial crimes, and 
continues to work hard to tighten financial controls. The 
criminalization of money laundering was added to the penal code 
in 1988 when laundering the proceeds from narcotics trafficking 
was made a criminal offense. In 1995 the law was expanded to 
cover all serious crimes that required a prison sentence greater 
than three years. All forms of money laundering were made 
financial crimes in amendments to the code on November 25, 2003, 
which took effect on October 1, 2004. 
 
The penal code can also apply to individuals in financial firms 
if their institutions have been used for financial crimes. An 
amendment to the penal code in 1991 made such persons culpable 
for both fraudulent acts and negligence connected with money 
laundering. 
 
Businesses and financial service suppliers operating in Spain or 
targeting Spanish markets are subject to the law, Ley de 
Servicios de la Sociedad de Informacion y de Comercio 
Electronico (LSSICE), that came into force on October 12, 2002, 
for Internet marketing and distribution. The new law requires 
businesses to register their domain names, company registry, 
physical address, and other company details. Financial sector 
businesses such as online banks must still send written 
contracts to new customers for signature and obtain physical 
proof of their identity, in order to comply with existing 
banking regulations. 
 
Royal Decree 998/2003 of July 5, 2003 modified the structure of 
the Ministry of Interior to facilitate more active combating of 
drug trafficking. This law creates an Advisory Committee on 
Observation that will attempt to follow the use of technologies 
by criminal organizations and money launderers and take measures 
to ensure that Spanish law enforcement authorities are able to 
meet the new challenges. 
 
Specific measures to prevent money laundering were written to 
regulate the legal entities in the financial sector and 
individuals moving large sums of cash, in December 1993 (Law No. 
19/1993), as an expansion to the criminal code that previously 
applied only to physical persons. The regulations for enactment 
were established by Royal Decree 925/1995, which set the 
standards for regulation of the financial system. The 
regulations were amended in 2003 and cover money laundering 
linked to illicit drugs, terrorism, and organized crime. The 
financial sector is required to identify customers, keep records 
of transactions, and report suspicious financial transactions. 
The money laundering law applies to most entities active in the 
financial system, including banks, mutual savings associations, 
credit companies, insurance companies, financial advisers, 
brokerage and securities firms, postal services, currency 
exchange outlets, casinos, and individuals and unofficial 
financial institutions exchanging or transmitting money 
(alternative remittance systems). The 2003 amendments add 
lawyers and notaries as covered entities. Previously, notaries 
and lawyers were required to report suspicious cases, but now 
they are considered part of the financial system that is under 
the supervision of appropriate regulators. 
 
Law 19/2003 obligates financial institutions to make monthly 
reports on large transactions. Banks are required to report all 
international transfers greater than 30,000 euros. The law also 
requires the declaration and reporting of internal transfers of 
funds greater than 80,500 euros. 
 
In addition to suspicious transactions, individuals traveling 
internationally are required to report the importation or 
exportation of currency greater than 6,000 euros. Law 19/2003 
allows the seizure of up to 100 percent if illegal activity 
under financial crimes ordinances can be proven. Spanish 
authorities claim they have seen a drop in cash carriers since 
the law\'s enactment in July 2003. For cases where the money can 
not be connected to criminal activity, and has not been 
declared, the authorities may keep between 25 and 100 percent, 
depending on the amount of the currency being carried. 
 
The Commission for the Prevention of Money Laundering and 
Financial Crimes (CPBC) coordinates the fight against money 
laundering in Spain. The Secretary of State for Economy heads 
the commission and all of the agencies involved in the 
prevention of money laundering participate. The representatives 
include the National Drug Plan Office, the Ministry of Economy, 
the Federal Prosecutors (Fiscalia), Customs, the Spanish 
National Police, the Guardia Civil, CNMV (equivalent to the 
SEC), the Treasury, the Bank of Spain, and the Director General 
of Insurance and Pension Funds. Any member of the Commission may 
request an investigation, should suspicious activity be brought 
to his or her attention. 
 
The CPBC delegates responsibility to two additional 
organizations. The first is a secretariat in the Treasury, 
located in the Ministry of Economy. Following investigation and 
a guilty verdict by a court, this regulating body carries out 
penalties. Sanctions can include closure, fines, account 
freezes, or seizures of assets. Law 19/2003 allows seizures of 
assets of third parties in criminal transactions, and a seizure 
of real estate in an amount equivalent to the illegal profit. 
One weakness that remains in financial sanctions is that the 
joint owner may access joint accounts if he or she can show 
financial need. 
 
The second organization is the Executive Service of the 
Commission for the Prevention of Money Laundering (SEPBLAC), 
which serves as Spain\'s financial intelligence unit. SEPBLAC 
receives and analyzes suspicious activity reports (SARs) and 
currency transaction reports. SEPBLAC has the primary 
responsibility for any investigation in money laundering cases 
and directly supervises the anti-money laundering procedures of 
banks and financial institutions. Incriminating information is 
turned over to the Federal Prosecutors for prosecution. Spanish 
banks are required by law to maintain fiscal information for 
five years and mercantile records for six years. 
 
The Fund of Seized Goods of Narcotics Traffickers receives 
seized assets. This agency was established under the National 
Drug Plan. The proceeds from the funds are divided, with half 
going to drug treatment programs and half to a foundation that 
supports the officers fighting narcotics trafficking. 
 
Terrorist financing issues are governed by a separate code of 
law and commission, the Commission of Vigilance of Terrorist 
Finance Activities (CVAFT). This commission was created under 
Law 12/2003 on the Prevention and Blocking of the Financing of 
Terrorism. The commission is headed by the Ministry of Interior 
and includes representatives from the Fiscalia and Ministries of 
Justice and Economy. Currently, only the head of CVAFT can 
request information in terrorist financing cases, so other 
members must rely on the commission head to begin an 
investigation. 
 
Crimes of terrorism are defined in Article 571 of the Penal 
Code, and penalties are set forth in Articles 572 and 574. 
Sanctions range from ten to thirty years\' imprisonment with 
longer terms if the terrorist actions were directed against 
government officials. Their ability to freeze accounts in the 
most recent law is more aggressive than that of most of their 
European counterparts. Though many laws are transposed from EU 
directives, Law 12/2003 goes beyond EU requirements. However, 
the implementing regulations for this law have not been written, 
and it has not been used. Once in full effect, this law will 
allow administrative freezing of suspect assets without a 
judge\'s order. 
 
All legal charities are placed on a register maintained by the 
Ministry of Justice. Responsibility for policing registered 
charities lies with the Ministry of Public Administration. If 
the charity fails to comply with the requirements, sanctions or 
other criminal charges may be levied. 
 
Spain is a member of the FATF, and co-chairs the FATF terrorist 
finance working group. Spain is a participating and cooperating 
nation to the South American Financial Action Task Force 
(GAFISUD), and a cooperating and supporting nation to the 
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF). Spain is a major 
provider of counterterrorism assistance. The GOS ratified the UN 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime on March 2, 
2002, and the UN International Convention for the Suppression of 
the Financing of Terrorism on April 9, 2002. Spain is also a 
party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. SEPBLAC is a member of the 
Egmont Group. 
 
The GOS has signed criminal mutual legal assistance agreements 
with Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican 
Republic, Mexico, Morocco, Uruguay, and the United States. 
Spain\'s Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the United States 
has been in effect since 1993. Spain also has entered into 
bilateral agreements for cooperation and information exchange on 
money laundering issues with Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador, 
France, Israel, Italy, Malta, Mexico, Panama, Portugal, Russia, 
Turkey, Venezuela, Uruguay, and the United States. Spain 
actively collaborates with Europol, supplying and exchanging 
information on terrorist groups. U.S. law enforcement agencies 
reported excellent cooperation with their Spanish counterparts 
in 2004.  U.S. customs works closely with Spanish customs, 
Spanish prosecutors, the national police corps and the Civil 
Guard.  The Drug Enforcement Administration works closely with 
SEPBLAC, the national police and the Civil Guard. These 
organizations regularly share information. Official documents 
however, will only be transferred if requested by a court. 
 
Seizures of assets involving more than one country and the 
division of the assets depend on the relationship with the third 
country. EU working groups will determine how to divide the 
proceeds for member countries. Outside of the EU, bilateral 
commissions are formed with countries that are members of FATF, 
FATF-like bodies and the Egmont Group, to deal with the division 
of seized assets. With other countries, negotiations are 
conducted on an ad hoc basis. The U.S.-Spain MLAT provides for 
sharing of seized assets, but the request must be made to the 
Spanish court hearing the case, rather than administratively.

SUBJECT: 2005 ICCAT CONTRIBUTION 
 
1.  Embassy received a letter dated December 14 from the 
Madrid-based International Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) requesting payment of the U.S.\'s 2005 
dues of 148,810.15 euros.  The letter indicates that payment 
can be made either via an international bank draft, payable 
to ICCAT and sent to its Executive Secretary, or via a bank 
transfer to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), Oficina 
Institucional No. 1, Calle Alcala, 16, Madrid 28014.  The 
BBVA account numbers are IBAN ES 94 0182 5906 8702 00173290 
for euro deposits or IBAN ES 30 0182 5906 8420 10012035 for 
U.S. dollar deposits.  If the deposit is made in U.S. 
dollars, the amount received will be converted to euros at 
the official UN exchange rate in effect on the date of 
notification of the deposit to the ICCAT account. 
 
2.  The letter indicates that copies were sent to Secretary 
Powell, Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Head Delegate of the 
U.S. to ICCAT W.T. Hogarth, and Chairman of the ICCAT 
Standing Committee on Finance and Administration (STACFAD) J. 
Jones.  Embassy will fax a copy of the letter and its 
attachments to OES/OMC (Dierdre Warner-Kramer). 
 
3.  COMMENT:  The U.S. only paid its 2004 dues in September 
2004, after receipt of at least one \"reminder\" from ICCAT. 
The delay was reportedly caused by insufficient Congressional 
appropriations which required funds to be reprogrammed prior 
to payment.

E.O. 12958: DECL: N/A 
TAGS: EINV, KTDB, SP, OPIC, USTR 
SUBJECT: INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 250356 
 
1. Openness to Foreign Investment 
 
A. The socialist (PSOE) government of Spain that assumed office 
in March, 2004 is interested in attracting foreign investment. 
There have been no significant changes in Spain\'s regulations 
for investment and foreign exchange under the new government. 
Spanish law permits foreign investment of up to 100 percent of equity 
and 
capital movements have been completely liberalized. 
 
B. On April 1999, the adoption of royal decree 664/1999 
eliminated the need for government authorization of any 
investments save those in activities \"directly related to 
national defense,\" such as arms production. The decree abolished 
previous authorization requirements on investments in other 
sectors deemed of strategic interest, such as communications and 
transportation.  It also removed all forms of portfolio 
authorization and established free movement of capital into Spain 
as well as Spanish capital out of the country.  As a result, 
Spanish law now conforms with the multi-disciplinary EU Directive 
88/361, part of which prohibits all restrictions of capital 
movements between member states as well as between such states 
and 
other countries, and which classifies investors according to 
residence rather than nationality. 
 
C. Registration requirements are simple and straightforward, and 
apply to foreign and domestic investments equally. They aim to 
verify the purpose of the investment, and do not block any 
investment. 
 
D. Spain\'s privatization process is slowing down because the 
government has already sold off most of its leading publicly 
owned companies. The process for those remaining is open to all 
investors.  American companies have successfully participated in 
several purchases.  This year, the government will begin 
privatizing railroad assets and shipbuilding companies.  In 
2005, the  Spanish privatization holding company (SEPI) 
plans to privatize at least six companies and reduce ownership 
shares gradually in firms where SEPI is a minority shareholder. 
SEPI has already initiated the privatization of IZAR, a 
shipyard, by creating a construction firm for civilian 
construction.  The liberalization of the railroad company RENFE 
is the second big project of the socialist government for 2005. 
The last Council of Ministers in December 2004 approved two 
royal decrees with the by-laws of the two new companies that 
will manage the Spanish rail network, ADIF and RENFE-Operadora. 
 
E. The Spanish government has liberalized the energy, 
electricity, and telecommunications markets to varying degrees. 
These efforts have opened Spain\'s economy to new investment, 
including by American companies. However, many observers feel 
these changes have not been broad enough to fully stimulate the 
economy.   For example, in the telecommunications sector, many 
analysts believe that Telefonica\'s dominant position undermines 
competition and innovation.  Essentially, it is frequently 
difficult  for new entrants to gain traction in sectors 
dominated by former state run monopolies such as Telefonica. 
 
2. Conversion and Transfer Policies 
 
There are no controls on capital flows.  On February, 1992, royal 
decree 1816/1991 provided complete freedom of action in financial 
transactions between residents and non-residents of Spain. 
Previous requirements for prior clearance of technology transfer 
and technical assistance agreements were eliminated. The liberal 
provisions of this law apply to payments, receipts, and transfers 
generated by foreign investments in Spain. Capital controls on 
the transfer of funds outside of the country were abolished in 
1991.  Remittances of profits, debt service, capital gains and 
royalties from intellectual property can all be affected at 
market rates using commercial banks. 
 
3. Expropriation and Compensation 
 
Spanish legislation sets up a series of safeguards that virtually 
prohibit the nationalization or expropriation of foreign 
investment. No expropriation or nationalization of foreign 
investment has taken place in recent years.  There are no 
outstanding investment disputes between the United States and 
Spain. 
 
4. Dispute Settlement 
 
A. Legislation establishes mechanisms to solve disputes if they 
arise. The judicial system is open and transparent, although 
slow- 
moving at times. The Spanish judiciary system is independent from 
the executive; therefore, the government is obliged to follow 
court rulings.  Judges are in charge of prosecution and criminal 
investigation, which permits greater independence.  The Spanish 
prosecution system allows for successive appeals to a higher 
Court of Justice.  The European Court of Justice can hear the 
final appeal.  In addition, the Government of Spain abides by 
rulings of the International Court of Justice at The 
Hague. Spain is a member of both the International Center for the 
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and the New York 
Convention of 1958 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign 
Arbitral Awards. 
B. Spain has a fair and transparent bankruptcy regime. In June 
2003, the Spanish Parliament approved a new, modern bankruptcy 
law which entered into force on September 1, 2004. 
 
5. Performance Requirements/Incentives 
 
A. Performance requirements are not used to determine the 
eligibility or level of incentives granted to investors.  A range 
of investment incentives exists in Spain, and they are provided 
according to the authorities granting incentives and the type and 
purpose of the incentives. 
 
B. Authorities that provide incentives in Spain: 
 
- 1. The European Union: 
 
The European Union provides incentives in the form of subsidies 
in general development programs such as FEDER and F.S.E. FEOGA- 
Guarantee.  They also provide programs to target specific sectors 
under the EU Sixth Framework Programme.  The Government of Spain 
manages these incentives locally.  However, many benefits from 
EU- 
sponsored programs are limited to companies located in the 
European Community.  These incentives will become less 
financially significant over the coming years as Spain\'s 
increasing wealth and EU enlargement will lead to a smaller 
share for Spain of the EU\'s general development  programs. 
 
- 2. The Central Government: 
 
-      a. The central government grants incentives out of its 
annual budget.  Usually, these incentives match EU financing. 
Central government incentive programs are easily available for 
direct investment plans. The Ministry of Economy and Ministry of 
Science and Technology play active roles in granting the 
incentives. 
 
-      b. The Foreign Investment Department, under the Ministry 
of Economy, counsels new market investors in the application for 
government incentives.  The Ministry of Economy\'s sector-related 
departments negotiate directly with the old market investors to 
inform them of incentives available for new investments. 
 
- 3. The Regional Government: 
 
Regional governments, called Autonomous Communities, also 
maintain specific programs to attract investment, which are often 
designed to complement central government incentives. 
 
- 4. Municipalities: 
 
-      a. Municipal corporations offer incentives to direct 
investment by facilitating infrastructure needs, granting 
licenses, and allowing for the operation and transaction of 
permits.  Usually they are designed to help ease the initial 
operations of direct investment. 
 
-      b. Generally, the regional governments are responsible for 
the management of each type of investment.  This provides a 
benefit to investors as each autonomous community has a specific 
interest in attracting investment that enhances its economy. 
 
-      c. Types of incentives available: 
 
--   Financial subsidies 
--   Exemption from certain taxes 
--   Preferential access to official credit 
--   Reduction of burdens, with social security discounts to 
     companies 
--   Bonuses for acquisition of certain material 
--   Customs exemption for certain imported goods 
--   Real estate grants, and gratuitous or favorable land grants 
--   Guarantees granted in credit operations 
--   Loans with low interest, long maturities, and grace periods 
--   Guarantee of dividends 
--   Professional training and qualification 
--   Indirect aid by means of supplying infrastructure facilities 
     (accesses, services, communications, etc.) 
 
-      d. Incentives from national, regional or municipal 
governments and the EU are granted to Spanish and foreign 
companies alike without discrimination. 
 
-      e. Spain is in compliance with WTO TRIMS [Trade-Related 
Investment Measures] obligations. 
 
6. Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
 
A. The Constitution protects private ownership.  Spanish law 
establishes clear rights to private ownership and foreign firms 
receive the same legal treatment as Spanish companies. 
 
B. There is no discrimination against public or private firms 
with respect to local access to markets, credit, licenses and 
supplies. 
 
7. Protection of Property Rights 
 
A. Spanish law protects property rights with enforcement carried 
out at the administrative and judicial levels.  Any decision by 
the Administration pertaining to property rights can be appealed 
first at the administrative level and then at the judicial level, 
which has three levels of court appeals.  Property protection is 
effective in Spain, although the system is slow.  The Spanish 
legal system fully recognizes property rights and facilitates 
their acquisition and disposition. 
 
B. Spanish patent, copyright, and trademark laws all approximate 
or exceed EU levels of intellectual property protection. Spain is 
a party to the Paris Convention, Bern Convention, the Madrid 
Accord on Trademarks , and the Universal Copyright Conventions. 
Spain has ratified the World Intellectual Property 
Organization\'s (WIPO)  Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the WIPO 
Phonograms and Performances Treaty (WPPT), the so-called 
internet treaties.  However, it has not passed implementing 
legislation yet for these treaties because it has not 
implemented the EU Copyright Directive (dealing with much of the 
same substance of the internet treaties) yet.  Some industry 
observers say that Spain is therefore lacking in protection of 
internet-based intellectual property.  The GOS recently unveiled 
an anti-piracy initiative which, together with WIPO internet 
treaty implementing legislation slated for passage this year, 
may address some of these problems.  The GOS\'s plans for 
combating intellectual property piracy may also have a positive 
effect in curtailing street piracy (discussed in section C). 
 
 
C. Public and private sector enforcement actions (especially 
private sector initiatives) using Spain\'s new patent, copyright 
and trademark legal framework have greatly increased the number 
of criminal and civil actions taken against intellectual property 
pirates.  Despite enforcement efforts, piracy remains a 
significant problem.  Sale of pirate music CDs has increased 
dramatically, sparked by growth in organized pirate CD production 
operations.  Industry sources estimate that illegal CDs 
constitute 30% of the Spanish market with pirated versions of new 
releases approaching 50%.  Pirated software, videogames and DVDs 
are also sold widely. 
 
- a. Patents 
A non-renewable 20-year period for working patents is available 
if the patent is used within the first three years.  Spain 
permits both product and process patents. 
 
Spain has ratified the 1973 Munich European Patent Convention 
allowing Spain to be designated in a European patent application. 
European patents are administered by the European Patent Office, 
based in Munich (Germany). 
b. Copyrights 
 
The law extends copyright protection to all literary, artistic or 
scientific creations, including computer software.  Spain and the 
United States are members of the Universal Copyright Convention. 
For protection, U.S. authors must register with this 
organization. 
 
 c. Trademarks 
 
There are various procedures to register a trademark in Spain. 
The Spanish Office of Patents and Trademarks oversees protection 
for national trademarks.  Trademarks registered in the Industrial 
Property Registry receive protection for a 10-year period from 
the date of application, which may be renewed.  Protection is not 
granted for generic names, geographic names, those that violate 
Spanish customs or other inappropriate trademarks.  Spanish 
authorities published a new Trademark law in 2001 (Law 17/2001), 
which came into effect in July 2002. 
 
Applicants must designate the countries where they wish to obtain 
protection.  The World International Property Organization (WIPO, 
headquartered in Geneva) oversees an international system of 
patent registration.  However, this system only applies to US 
firms with an establishment in a country which is a party of the 
Agreement or the Protocol. 
 
Business may seek a trademark valid throughout the EU.  The 
Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM) for the 
registration of community trademarks in the European Union 
started its operations in 1996.  Its headquarters are located in 
Alicante: 
 
Oficina de Armonizacion del Mercado Interior (Office for 
Harmonization in the Internal Market) 
Avenida Aguilera, 20 
03080 Alicante 
Tel: (34) 96-513-9100 
Fax: (34) 96-513-9173 
 
8. Transparency of the Regulatory System 
 
A. Spain modernized its commercial laws and regulations following 
its 1986 entry into the EU.  Its local regulatory framework 
compares favorably with other major European countries. 
Bureaucratic procedures have been streamlined and much red tape 
has been eliminated, though permitting and licensing processes 
can still suffer delays. Efficacy of regulation at the regional 
level is uneven. 
 
B. Quasi-independent regulatory bodies exist in several sectors; 
however, they are for the most part still finding their role and 
fighting to assert their independence. Making the transition from 
state-owned monopolies to promoting full and open competition has 
been a slow, but steady process. 
 
C. The comment process for proposed rule-making changes is not 
as formal as in the United States. Spain does not have an 
official comment procedure for government regulations like the 
U.S. system. Most new laws and regulations are published as 
drafts before they go into force, 
but by the time they are published, there are often limited 
opportunities to 
change them. Government officials do seek out stakeholder 
comments before finalizing significant regulations, but the 
comment system is geared towards collecting input from officially 
recognized industry sector associations or consumer 
organizations.  The general public will not necessarily be aware 
of a regulation until it is finalized and published. 
 
9. Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
 
A. Lower interest rates due to the convergence of monetary policy 
following the adoption of the euro has led to a significant 
lowering of interest rates in recent years.  Foreign investors do 
not face discrimination when seeking local financing for 
projects.  There is a large range of credit instruments available 
through Spanish and international financial institutions. Many 
large Spanish companies rely on cross-holding arrangements and 
ownership stakes by banks rather than pure loans. However,  these 
arrangements do not act to restrict foreign ownership.  Several 
of the largest 
Spanish companies that engage in this practice are also traded 
publicly in the U.S. 
 
B. Corporate scandals in the U.S. and Europe, 
further integration of European capital markets and efforts to 
make Spain a more attractive destination for foreign investment 
have led to several new initiatives to improve the transparency 
of capital markets and corporate governance.  Spanish business 
organizations and private economic think tanks are pro-active on 
corporate governance issues.  In 2003 and 2004, Spanish business 
leaders created a progressive code of business practices and 
ethics.  In 2004, Spanish regulatory agencies and lawmakers 
codified the business codes and required Spain\'s listed 
companies to follow a rigorous set of corporate governance and 
transparency rules.  Spain\'s government views corporate 
governance rules as a means of ameliorating the effects of 
concentrated economic power and preventing a major corporate 
scandal along the lines of Enron or Parmalat. 
 
Due to extensive cross-ownership within a small universe of 
dominant companies, 
Spanish corporations have traditionally not had truly independent 
board members.  This situation is slowly changing, with several 
leading Spanish companies introducing independent members to 
their boards  in an effort to improve transparency. 
Hostile takeover rules and the threat of a government \"Golden 
Share\" veto have been used to prevent takeovers of companies. 
While surfacing on occasion in purely Spanish transactions, these 
defenses are most often used when the acquiring company was 
partially or fully owned by other governments, with the Spanish 
government and securities regulators acting to prevent what they 
interpret as another government taking over a privatized Spanish 
company.  A  European court of Justice decision has ruled 
such practices illegal. 
 
C. The domestic Spanish banking system is regarded as healthy, 
with four banks dominating the market.  Spanish regulators have 
recently focused attention on these banks\' exposure to non- 
performing Latin American assets, and have required full 
provisions against this exposure. In 2003, new Spanish gross 
investment abroad was USD 27.5 billion, showing a  30 percent 
drop from the 2002 annual level.  During the first six months of 
2004, Spanish authorities recorded USD 8.5 billion in new 
foreign direct investment, a decrease of 35.15 percent compared 
with investment in the first semester of 2003. (Note: Statistics 
on Spanish overseas investments and foreign investments in Spain 
for the second semester of 2004 will be available in May or June 
of 2005.) The drop in Spanish overseas investment reflects, in 
part, fewer attractive opportunities for Spanish companies in 
Latin America as many of the major privatization there have 
already taken place. 
 
10. Political Violence 
 
A. The Government of Spain is involved in a long-running campaign 
against Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA), a terrorist 
organization founded in 1959 and dedicated to promoting Basque 
independence.  ETA regularly targets Spanish government 
officials, members of the military and security forces, 
journalists, and members of the Popular Party and Socialist Party 
for assassination.  U.S. citizens and U.S. companies have not 
been ETA targets.  In recent years, the Spanish government has 
secured greater security cooperation from French authorities on 
the ETA threat.  ETA reaffirmed its commitment to using terror in 
the wake of September 11.  ETA has killed over 40 persons since 
January 2000 and about 850 persons since its founding.  Its main 
methods are car bombs and assassinations with firearms. ETA 
operatives extort \"revolutionary taxes\" from businesspersons and 
professionals living in the Basque region, sometimes bombing 
their property to intimidate them into paying extortion demands. 
ETA supporters also engage in street violence and vandalism 
against government facilities, economic targets (particularly 
banks), and the homes and property of persons opposed to ETA\'s 
cause.  In 2004, the GOS arrested several  important high- 
ranking ETA members and two top ETA leaders were arrested in 
France.  ETA responded by detonating small bombs in Madrid and 
other cities, but most observers believe the organization has 
been greatly weakened by the 2004 arrests. 
 
 
 
B. On March 11, 2004, Islamic terrorists killed 191 people on 
trains headed for Madrid\'s central Atocha train station. 
Several foreign nationals died in the attack, although there 
were no American citizen casualties.  Islamic extremists remain 
active in Spain and if there are other attacks, American 
citizens/property could be hurt/damaged, although, so far, U.S. 
citizens and companies in Spain have not been direct Islamic 
terrorist targets. 
 
11. Corruption 
 
A. Giving or accepting a bribe is a criminal act.  Under the 
Spanish civil code, section 1255, corporations and individuals 
are prohibited from deducting bribes from domestic tax 
computations. 
 
B. Spain has a wide variety of laws, regulations, and penalties 
dealing with corruption.  The legal regime has both civil and 
criminal sanctions for corruption, bribery, financial 
malfeasance, etc.  The Spanish legal regime is hampered, however, 
by the fact that only natural persons, as opposed to legal 
persons, can be held criminally liable for the actions of a 
company.  Furthermore, civil and administrative proceedings 
cannot begin until there is a finding of criminal liability 
against a natural person.  Although the Ministry of Justice has 
initiated an amendment process to provide for sanctions of legal 
persons, it has not yet become law. 
 
C. Spain is a signatory of the OECD Convention on Combating 
Bribery, and Spanish officials attach importance to combating 
corruption. The government is working to amend domestic law to 
make the Convention a more useful investigative and prosecutorial 
tool. 
 
D. The General State Prosecutor is authorized to investigate and 
prosecute corruption cases involving funds in excess of roughly 
USD $500,000.  The Office of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor, a 
subordinate unit of the General State Prosecutor, has 15-20 
prosecutors in Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia who are tasked 
with investigating and prosecuting domestic and international 
bribery allegations.  There is also the \"Audiencia Nacional,\" a 
corps of magistrates given broad discretion to investigate and 
prosecute alleged instances of Spanish businesspeople bribing 
foreign officials. 
 
E. Spain enforces anti-corruption laws on a generally uniform 
basis.  Public officials are probably subjected to more scrutiny 
than private individuals, but several wealthy and well-connected 
business executives have been successfully prosecuted for 
corruption.  There is no obvious bias for or against foreign 
investors. U.S. firms have not identified corruption as an 
obstacle to investment in Spain. 
 
F. Conversations with representatives of the Spanish legal 
community indicate that the Convention is increasingly being 
taken into account in the drafting of contracts.  Spanish 
companies, both domestic and multinational, are insisting that 
clauses protecting them against requests for bribes be inserted 
into business contracts.  Tax evasion, particularly by those who 
work in cash-based sectors has reportedly been heavy. 
 
11.B Bilateral Investment Agreements (Ana Maria please check 
this section and provide updated numbers for the remainder of 
the report). 
 
A. Spain has concluded bilateral investment agreements with 
Hungary (1989), Morocco (1989), Bolivia (1990), the Czech 
Republic (1990), Russia (1990), Argentina (1991), Chile (1991), 
Tunisia (1991), China (1992), Egypt (1992), Poland (1992), 
Uruguay (1992), Paraguay (1993), Philippines (1993), Algeria 
(1994), Honduras (1994), Pakistan (1994), Kazakhstan (1994), Peru 
(1994), Cuba (1994), Nicaragua (1994), Lithuania (1994), Bulgaria 
(1995), The Dominican Republic (1995), El Salvador (1995), Gabon 
(1995), Latvia (1995), Malaysia (1995), Romania (1995), Indonesia 
(1995), Venezuela (1995), Mexico (1995), Turkey (1995), Lebanon 
(1996), Ecuador (1996), Costa Rica (1997), Croatia (1997), 
Estonia (1997), India (1997), Panama (1997), Slovenia (1998), 
South Africa (1998), Ukraine (1998), the Kingdom of Jordan 
(1999),  Trinidad and Tobago  (1999), the Bolivian Republic 
(2001), Jamaica (2002), the Islamic Republic of Iran (2002), the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (2002), Bosnia and Herzegovina 
(2002), Namibia  (2003), Albania  (2003), and  Uzbekistan  (2003) 
 
B. Spain and the United States have a Friendship, Navigation and 
Commerce (FCN) Treaty and a Bilateral Taxation Treaty (1990). 
Spanish officials have indicated that they would like to keep 
the FCN, despite indications that the EU Commission would like 
Member States to terminate bilateral FCN agreements. 
 
11.C OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs 
 
A. As Spain is a member of the European Union, OPIC insurance is 
not applicable. Various EU directives, as adopted into Spanish 
law, adequately protect the rights of foreign investors. Spain is 
currently a member of the World Bank\'s Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA). 
 
11.D Labor 
 
A. Employment estimates for 2004 show that there are about 19.2 
million Spaniards in the work force.  This figure is expected to 
climb to 19.5 million for 2005.  Meanwhile, unemployment 
continued 
its decrease from the 1994 high of 24.2 percent down to 10.54 
percent in third quarter of 2004.  Unemployment for women 
continues to be substantially higher than the male average, at 
14.38 percent compared to 7.87 percent.  Spain faces a shortage 
of 
high-tech workers for its IT sector, and of unskilled workers for 
its fishing and agricultural industries. 
 
B. Labor market reforms in 1994 and 1997  eased Spain\'s well- 
known labor market rigidities  but did not fundamentally change 
the difficult labor situation.  The result is  that one third of 
all employed Spaniards are classified as temporary hires. 
Spain\'s new socialist government promised to reform labor laws 
as part of their electoral program.  The government would like 
to move people from short-term contracts to regular employment 
status, but so far inducements to employers to make this happen 
have not been implemented.  The government recognizes that labor 
market reform is essential to increasing productivity, which 
Spain needs to do as it faces competition from lower-wage EU 
accession countries.  Collective bargaining reform should be 
part of this effort, but so far this has not happened either. 
In early 2005, for instance, the Spanish government approved 
indexing the minimum wage to inflation.  The unions supported 
this position and employers accepted it, albeit 
unenthusiastically with some employer representatives 
questioning the decision. 
 
C. Collective bargaining is widespread in both the private and 
public sectors. Sixty percent of the working population is 
covered by collective bargaining agreements although only a 
minority (generally estimated to be about 10 percent) are 
actually union members.  Under the Spanish system, workers elect 
delegates to represent them before management every four years. 
If a certain proportion of those delegates is union-affiliated, 
those unions form part of the workers\' committees.  Large 
employers generally have individual collective agreements.  In 
industries characterized by smaller companies, collective 
agreements are often industry-wide or regional. 
 
D. The constitution guarantees the right to strike and it has 
been interpreted to include the right to call general strikes 
called to protest 
government policy. 
 
11.E Foreign-Trade Zones/Free Ports 
 
A. Both on the mainland and islands there are numerous free trade 
zones (in most Spanish airports and seaports) where 
manufacturing, processing, sorting, packaging, exhibiting, 
sampling and other commercial operations may be undertaken free 
of any Spanish duties or taxes.  The largest free trade zones are 
in Barcelona, Cadiz and Vigo.  Others vary in size from a simple 
warehouse to several square kilometers.  Spanish customs 
legislation allows for companies to have their own free trade 
areas.  Duties and taxes are payable only on those items imported 
for use in Spain. These companies have to abide by Spanish labor 
laws.

to Registered Gross Investment discounted: a) acquisitions of 
shares and stakes in Spanish companies from other non-residents; 
and b) multiple accounting for the same investment as a result of 
business group restructuring in Spain. 
 
11.G Major Foreign Investors 
Foreign investment has played a significant role in modernizing 
the Spanish economy over the past 35 years.  Attracted by Spain\'s 
large domestic market, export possibilities and growth potential, 
foreign companies in large numbers have set up operations. 
Spain\'s automotive industry is almost entirely foreign-owned. 
 
Multinationals control half of the food production companies, a 
third of chemical firms and two-thirds of the cement sector. 
Several foreign banks have acquired networks from Spanish banks, 
and foreign firms control close to one third of the insurance 
market.  In 2003, Spain recorded USD 18.8 billion in new foreign 
direct investment, a decrease of 36.57 percent compared with 
investment in 2002.  In 2003, the non-European OECD countries 
were the largest investors accounting for  41.09 percent.  By 
countries, the largest investors were the United States, the 
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, 
Luxemburg, Canada, Germany, Italy, and Sweden.

3. We spoke with Cabinet Advisor to the Secretary of State 
for International Aid David del Campo to confirm Spain\'s aid 
contribution.  Del Campo stated that Spain pledged EUR 50 
million (USD 66.1 million) in Official Development Assistance 
credits for reconstruction, and will spend at least EUR 6 
million (USD 7.9 million) on emergency humanitarian 
assistance.  The GOS plans to send a plane of emergency 
assistance every 10 days until the situation has improved. 
Should the acute humanitarian situation be prolonged, the 
amount of aid provided will increase. 
 
4. Spain\'s emergency humanitarian assistance includes at 
least EUR 1 million (USD 1.3 million) donated by the 
governments of Spain\'s autonomous regions.  The regional 
government of Catalonia and Catalan municipal governments 
provided EUR 480 thousand (USD 635 thousand) of regional 
contributions.

High Level Political Interest 
----------------------------- 
 
5. President Zapatero held a press conference on January 8 to 
publicize Spain\'s response to the tsunami disaster.  He 
dispatched January 10 Foreign Minister Moratinos and 
Secretary of State for International Aid Leire Pajin to the 
 
SIPDIS 
region to meet with officials in Sri Lanka, Thailand and 
Indonesia.  In delivering reftel, we learned that the AECI 
Secretary General Juan Pablo de Laiglesia represented Spain 
 
SIPDIS 
at the January 11 UN Donor\'s Conference in Geneva.  Defense 
Minister Bono also worked closely with President Zapatero and 
other ministers on Spain\'s humanitarian response. 
 
------------------- 
Military Deployment 
------------------- 
 
6. Econoff spoke with The Ministry of Defense\'s Deputy 
Director General for Cooperation and Civil Defense General 
Jose Antonio Company Follana regarding Spain\'s military 
deployment in support of humanitarian efforts in the tsunami 
zone.  General Company confirmed that Spain would soon deploy 
a total force of 594 troops in the region.  Five transport 
planes were sent to Sumatra, and three will remain deployed 
in the region along with the first tranche of 70 troops. 
Spain will also send an amphibious ship, with a unit of 
engineers, a mobile hospital and helicopters. 
 
7. Comment. The GOS has made its humanitarian response to the 
Southeast Asian tsunami a high profile issue.  Spain\'s 
relatively generous aid package of EUR 56 million to a 
humanitarian disaster is noteworthy for a country that was 
itself an aid recipient during the past two decades.  The 
Socialist government has promised to increase international 
assistance during the next four years.  Spain\'s large tsunami 
aid package and its efforts at the highest governmental 
levels certainly indicate the GOS commitment to keeping that 
pledge.  We can also posit that the Zapatero government might 
view aid policy as an area where Spain is can take a more 
active international role in the next few years.

1. (C) Poloff delivered reftel points to Deputy National 
Security Adviser Maria Jesus Alonso on 1/11, following up on 
recent Embassy calls on Alonso and other GOS officials to 
encourage Spanish participation in ISAF Stage II through 
leadership of a PRT.  Poloff stressed the importance of the 
issue to the USG and to NATO of Spanish participation at a 
substantive level.  Poloff said that the USG had been 
confused by mixed signals regarding Spain\'s readiness to 
participating in NATO expansion into western Afghanistan.  On 
the one hand, we understood from our GOS interlocutors in 
Madrid that President Zapatero has made no decision regarding 
the scope and nature of the Spanish deployment in ISAF II and 
that Spain\'s new requirement of \"consultations\" with 
Parliament prior to new deployments presented a further 
political complication.  However, in NATO/ISAF councils, 
Spanish officials indicated a readiness to proceed with new 
deployments, including a possible PRT.  Specifically, Spanish 
officials on a recent scouting mission to Afghanistan seemed 
prepared to support a doubling of the Spanish deployment to 
1,000 troops and perhaps to take on a PRT in Qaleh-ye and/or 
the Herat FSB.  The USG took this to mean that Spain is 
leaning towards leading a PRT. 
 
2. (C) Alonso said that Spain understood its commitment to 
the NATO mission in Afghanistan and would continue to 
participate in that mission.  She emphasized that the 
composition of Spanish forces would be based primarily on the 
recommendations of the MFA and MOD.  While she hadn\'t yet 
seen the recommendations of the Spanish team that visited 
Afghanistan January 7-10, she said their input would be 
important in operational terms.  Alonso said she did not 
expect the requirement for consultations with Parliament to 
be a problem, except with respect to timing since Parliament 
does not reconvene until the first week in February.  She 
cautioned, however, that the GOS had to bear in mind public 
skepticism of Spanish involvement in virtually any military 
mission, which Afghanistan certainly was despite the 
humanitarian component.  Also, she suggested that Spain\'s 
recent deployment to support tsunami relief operations in 
Indonesia (594 troops, five airplanes, two helicopters, a 
medical unit, and several ships) had stretched Spanish 
manpower and resources, which might present a problem GOS 
planners hadn\'t forseen with repect to the GOS contribution 
to Afghanistan.  The mission in Indonesia is currently 
expected to last two months. 
 
3. (C) Poloff also delivered reftel points to MFA Deputy 
Director General for Foreign Policy Felix Costales and noted 
our confusion regarding Spain\'s position on leading a PRT. 
Costales said that a PRT would be a very new type of project 
for the GOS and that there were ongoing internal discussions 
regarding the composition of a Spanish-led PRT.  Most 
importantly, Spain did not want a primarily military PRT such 
as those led by the U.S. and the UK, but instead wanted to 
emphasize the humanitarian aspect of such a mission.  Like 
Alonso, Costales noted that Spain\'s delivery of aid and 
assistance to victims of the tsunami disaster presented a 
possible complication for Spain\'s contribution to ISAF Stage 
II. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
4. (C) We have heavily lobbied the GOS at all levels of the 
MOD, MFA, and the President\'s staff to lead a PRT and/or 
other important missions in Afghanistan.  General B. B. Bell 
made a strong pitch to Spanish officers on the margins of a 
1/10 visit to his NATO counterpart in Madrid.  While the GOS 
military is clearly anxious to take on a larger role, their 
political leaders are far more cautious.  In a recent meeting 
with Charge, National Security Adviser equivalent Carles 
Casajuana was adamant that no new Spanish deployment could 
move forward without Parliamentary approval.  Spain\'s 
contribution to tsunami relief operations is a new twist and 
could tempt the GOS to further delay a tough decision on its 
participation in ISAF II.  We will continue to push the GOS 
hard on this issue, but recognize that their strong aversion 
to operations that could result in military casualties is a 
very significant impediment.  Zapatero\'s officials are well 
aware that the popularity of his government is based mainly 
on his reversal of former President Aznar\'s unpopular 
decision to deploy Spanish forces to Iraq.  The GOS does not 
want to give the opposition a similar opportunity.

1.  (C)  Poloff discussed policy issue papers and reftel 
talking points concerning U.S. nonproliferation amendments to 
the Convention against the Suppression of Unlawful Acts 
against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) with Marcos 
Rodriguez Cantero, MFA Deputy Director General for 
Disarmament Affairs, and Jose Maria Lavina, a member of the 
MFA technical staff on disarmament and terrorism issues. 
Spain supports the U.S. amendment to SUA regarding dual-use 
offense and will likely support the amendment to SUA 
regarding transfer of dual-use items to non-state and state 
actors.  Lavina said that the coordinating group on SUA 
related issues had not discussed the implications of the 
second U.S. policy paper regarding the transfer of dual-use 
items to non-state and state actors, but that the group would 
meet before the end of the month and have a decision before 
meetings in Brussels beginning January 31.  The coordinating 
group is composed of members from six agencies--Justice, 
Interior, Transportation, Treasury, Defense, and the MFA. 
Lavina promised to raise concerns at the next coordinating 
group meeting.  Spain agrees with the U.S. interpretation of 
UNSC 1540. 
 
2.  (C)  Rodriguez Cantero and Lavina did not know who would 
be representing Spain at the January 17, 2005, European law 
of the sea meeting (COMAR) that will be chaired by the 
Netherlands.  Lavina said that a member of the Ministry of 
Transportation will probably represent Spain at the meeting. 
He said that he would call post when he found out who would 
represent Spain. 
 
// SOUNDING OUT USG VIEWS ON IAEA LEADERSHIP // 
 
3.  (C)  Rodriguez Cantero was interested in the U.S. view of 
Mohammed ElBaradei\'s intention to run for a third term as 
head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
Although the Spanish government supports ElBaradei, Rodriguez 
Cantero said he personally would favor a change in 
leadership, as ElBaradei has already served two terms.  He 
had heard that the U.S. was not supportive of ElBaradei, but 
he wondered if the U.S. was going to take any concrete 
actions against his bid for a third-term as IAEA head. 
Poloff told Rodriguez Cantero that the U.S. had not taken any 
formal action against ElBaradei\'s bid.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, AMGT, ALOW, SP, ELTN, EFIN 
SUBJECT: MADRID PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  During 2004 there was a general increase in the 
cost of living in Madrid and the CPI rose 2.9%.  The 
transportation and food sectors experienced the highest cost 
increases, whereas domestic utilities, property taxes and 
leisure activity prices remained relatively stable.  Many of 
the increases in the cost of living can be attributed to 
measures taken by the municipal government. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. In 2004, the cost of living in Madrid rose by 2.9%. Food 
prices and transportation costs rose most substantially over 
the past year, while domestic utility prices, property taxes 
and leisure activity costs increased by amounts close to the 
2.9% CPI level. 
 
------------- 
FOOD PRODUCTS 
------------- 
3.  Food product prices increased significantly in the past 
year.  The typical food product in Madrid markets rose 17.35% 
during 2004.  Despite this figure, prices for certain 
products, notably chocolate and beans, have decreased.  Fish, 
a main component of the Spanish diet, has experienced 
particularly high cost increases. 
 
-------------- 
TRANSPORTATION 
-------------- 
4.  One of the largest cost increases in Madrid has occurred 
in the transportation sector.  Public transportation costs 
increased an average of 6% beginning in January 2005.  Metro 
and city bus ticket prices increased more than 13% while 
intercity bus fares increased only marginally (about 2%). 
The government has yet to decide when and by how much Renfe 
(national rail system) fares will increase.  Street parking 
will become significantly more expensive in 2005, with meter 
fees to increase up to 48%. 
 
------------ 
PROPERTY TAX 
------------ 
5.  Property taxes on most residences  will increase at the 
same rate as the CPI, 2.9%.  Larger increases in property tax 
will affect the most valuable 10% of property.. 
 
------------------ 
DOMESTIC UTILITIES 
------------------ 
6.  Domestic utility costs remained relatively stable, or 
even decreased relative to the CPI measure.  Electricity 
prices rose by 1.71% in 2004 and the cost of water increased 
by 2.3% (or one cent per day).  The cost of natural gas 
remains equal to its cost a year ago. However, a small 
increase in gas prices is expected at the end of the quarter. 
 Fixed line telephone rates will increase by 2%, or about .26 
euro per month, beginning in February. 
 
-------------------------- 
SPORT, LEISURE AND CULTURE 
-------------------------- 
7. The cost for most sport, leisure and cultural activities 
remained stable throughout 2004. However, beginning in 2005, 
the Prado Museum doubled its entrance fees from three to six 
euros. 
 
8. Comment. The cost of living in Madrid increased noticeably 
in 2004.  This trend will most likely continue in 2005 as the 
Spanish economy grows.  This will be compounded by inflation 
rates which tend to grow faster in Spain, and especially 
Madrid, than in the rest of Europe. Madrid is quickly 
becoming one of Europe,s more expensive cities for 
Americans, even without the falling dollar.
