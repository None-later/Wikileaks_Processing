ZAIRE, AS REQUESTED IN REFTEL.  THEY ARE KEYED TO 
REFTEL PARAGRAPH 5, ITEMS A - H.

GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM. 
 
3. (U) PARAGRAPH 5, ITEM B:  THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS 
NOT REQUESTED EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR 
PROSECUTION.  THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EXTRADITED 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  A LOCAL NEWSPAPER AND A FRENCH 
MAGAZINE HAVE REPORTED THAT ZAIRIAN AUTHORITIES ARE 
HOLDING A SUSPECT IN THE SEPTEMBER 19, 1989 TERRORIST 
BOMBING OF A UTA AIRLINER.  THE PRESS ALSO REPORTED 
THAT A FRENCH LEGAL TEAM CAME TO KINSHASA TO ASSIST 
IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE SUSPECT, WHO IS EITHER A 
ZAIRIAN OR CONGOLESE CITIZEN.  IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE 
FRENCH WILL REQUEST EXTRADITION, BUT IT IS NOT YET 
KNOWN WHAT THE ZAIRIAN RESPONSE WILL BE. 
 
4. (U) PARAGRAPH 5, ITEM C:  WE SEE NO SIGNIFICANT 
IMPEDIMENTS TO ZAIRIAN  PROSECUTION AND/OR 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
5. (C) PARAGRAPH 5, ITEM C:  IN THE EVENT A SUSPECTED 
TERRORIST SHOULD BE LINKED TO LIBYA, ZAIRE WOULD NO 
DOUBT CONSIDER ITS GROWING (IF STILL LIMITED) TIES TO 
T RI P OL I. 
 
6. (U) PARAGRAPH 5, ITEM D:  PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND THE 
PRESS TAKE AN ACCEPTABLE, I.E., CONDEMNATORY, STANCE 
ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  AS NOTED ABOVE, ZAIRE IS 
REPORTEDLY COOPERATING WITH THE FRENCH IN AN INCIDENT 
OF AVIATION TERRORISM. 
 
7. (U) PARAGRAPH 5, ITEM E:  ZAIRE IS GENERALLY 
SUPPORTIVE OF U.S. AND WESTERN POSITIONS ON 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, BUT IS NOT A LEADER IN THE 
FIGHT AGAINST IT.  WHILE GENERALLY BACKING THE U.S., 
IT HAS TAKEN NO MAJOR INITIATIVES AGAINST TERRORISM 
IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
8. (U) PARAGRAPH 5, ITEM F:  ZAIRE HAS PROVIDED NO 
KNOWN SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
9. (C) PARAGRAPH 5, ITEM F:  IN OCTOBER - NOVEMBER 
1990, A CABINDAN GROUP, THE FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION 
OF THE ENCLAVE OF CABINDA - MILITARY POSITION 
(FLEC-PM), TO WHICH ZAIRE PROVIDES SAFEHAVEN AND 
TRAVEL DOCUMENTS, TOOK AN AMERICAN CITIZEN HOSTAGE IN 
CABINDA.  (QLDER AND SEPARATE FLEC ORGANIZATION 
HAS TAKEN PORTUGUESE AND FRENCH CITIZENS HOSTAGE IN 
THE REGION.  PORTUGUESE ARE STILL BEING HELD BY THIS 
GROUP.)  THE ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WILLING TO 
SUPPORT U.S. EFFORTS TO GAIN THE AMERICAN\'S RELEASE, 
BUT HAS NOT YET HAD TO FACE ANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS, 
E.G., WHETHER TO WITHHOLD ASSISTANCE FROM THE 
CABINDAN GROUP AS A MEANS TO TRY TO GAIN THE 
HOSTAGE\'S RELEASE. 
 
10. (U) PARAGRAPH 5, ITEM G:  THE HOST GOVERNMENT HAS 
MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. 
 
11. (U) PARAGRAPH 5, ITEM H:  THERE HAS BEEN NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1989, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, 
IN ZAIRE\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM.

REF:  STATE 286744 
 
1.  THIS IS A NEGATIVE REPORT SINCE THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY NO 
INCIDENTS TO REPORT.  PREMEDITATED ACTS OF VIOLENCE 
PERPETRATED AGAINST NONCOMBATANTS WERE NOT OF THE 
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED VARIETY BUT WERE RATHER CRIMINALLY, 
ETHNICALLY, OR TRIBALLY MOTIVATED.  EXAMPLES WERE THE 
CONTINUING VIOLENCE AGAINST ZAIRIANS OF KASAIAN ORIGIN 
RESIDING IN THE SHABA REGION OF ZAIRE DIRECTED AT DRIVING 
THE KASAIANS FROM SHABA.  ALSO, THERE WERE REPORTS OF 
CONTINUING INTERETHNIC VIOLENCE BETWEEN LOCAL ETHNIC GROUPS 
AND IMMIGRANTS FROM RWANDA IN THE KIVU REGION OF ZAIRE. 
GOVERNMENT TROOPS WERE SENT TO THE AREA TO RESTORE ORDER, 
BUT THERE WERE NO ARRESTS OR PROSECUTIONS. 
 
2.  A)  THERE WERE NO KNOWN PROSECUTIONS FOR TERRORISM, 
DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL, IN ZAIRE IN 1994.  NEITHER THE 
ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT, ITS CITIZENS, NOR ITS TERRITORY WERE 
KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN FACTORS IN ANY INCIDENTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM IN 1994. 
 
3.  B)  THE ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT DID NOT EXTRADITE NOR REQUEST 
THE EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN 1994. 
 
4.  C)  THERE WERE NO KNOWN IMPEDIMENTS TO ZAIRIAN 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS IN 1994. 
 
5.  D)  THE ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT DID NOT MAKE PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS REGARDING TERRORISM.  THERE WERE NO KNOWN 
TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ZAIRIAN 
GOVERNMENT, NOR DID IT PARTICIPATE IN INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
6.  E)  THERE WERE NO COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 
1994 BY THE ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT EITHER IN ZAIRE OR IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
7.  F)  THERE WAS NO KNOWN ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, EITHER POLITICAL OR FINANCIAL. 
THERE WAS NO KNOWN SANCTUARY EXTENDED TO TERRORISTS OR 
TERRORIST GROUPS, NOR WERE THEY TRAINED OR SUPPLIED BY THE 
ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT.  IRAN, LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, AND SUDAN 
MAINTAIN RESIDENT EMBASSIES IN KINSHASA, BUT THERE WERE NO 
OFFICES OF TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS IN ZAIRE. 
 
8.  G)  THE ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENT IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM 
ISSUE IN 1994. 
 
9.  H)  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE ZAIRIAN 
GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM IN 1994.

REPORT HAS BEEN CLEARED BY ALL RELEVANT SECTIONS IN 
THE EMBASSY. 
 
2.  AS REQUESTED, THE RESPONSE MIRRORS THE FORMAT 
PROVIDED IN REFTEL. 
 
A)  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM

CONSEQUENTLY, THERE HAVE BEEN NO COURT ACTIONS AND NO 
JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS TO MEASURE THE HOST GOVERNMENT 
ACTIONS IN THIS AREA.

EXTRADITE ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS DURING THE YEAR NOR 
HAS THE USG REQUESTED ANY SUCH ACTION. 
 
C)  N/A 
 
D)  THE GDROC STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE TERRORIST 
BOMBINGS OF THE US EMBASSIES IN NAIROBI AND DAR ES 
SALAAM.  THE STATEMENTS WERE MADE PUBLICLY BY 
PRESIDENT KABILA IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BOMBINGS. 
 
E)  N/A 
 
F)  ACCORDING TO OTHER REPORTING THERE MAY BE PASSIVE, 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT GROUPS OF THE HIZBOLLAH IN KINSHASA. 
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE GDROC SUPPORTS, KNOWS OF 
OR ASSISTS THIS GROUP IN ANY WAY. 
 
G)  WHILE THE GDROC HAS MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A 
TERRORISM ISSUE, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THREE STATE 
SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ARE SUPPORTING THE GDROC IN ITS 
CURRENT WAR.  THE SUPPORTING NATIONS ARE: LIBYA, SUDAN 
AND CUBA. 
 
H)  N/A 
 
I)  N/A 
 
J)  OUTSIDE OF REOUESTING NAME TRACES AND DOCUMENT 
SEARCHES, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SUBSTANTIAL REQUESTS MADE 
OF THE GDROC IN THIS AREA.  THE GDROC HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
COOPERATIVE IN THE AREA OF NAME TRACES AND DOCUMENT 
SEARCHES BUT IS LIMITED IN THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT A 
COMPLETE AND CONVINCING SEARCH. 
 
JI)  N/A 
 
JII) THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO OPEN CT CASES THAT THE 
RSO IS WORKING WITH THE GDROC.  IN ALL RESPECTS THE 
GDROC HAS EXPRESSED THE DESIRE TO INVESTIGATE AND 
ASSIST BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT PERSONNEL HAVE NO 
EXPERIENCE, ARE ILL-TRAINED AND EQUIPPED AND REQUIRE 
MUCH COACHING IN ANY TERRORIST INVESTIGATION. 
 
K)  THE GDROC IS CURRENTLY COOPERATING BY ALLOWING THE 
US EMBASSY TO SEAL OFF NORMAL VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AROUND 
THE CHANCERY AND CONSULATE (BOTH SIT DIRECTLY ON THE 
STREET).  WHILE THE GDROC HAS VERBALLY INDICATED THAT 
THE STREETS CAN BE CLOSED DOWN IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THE 
GDROC WILL ALLOW THIS TO BE MADE A PERMANENT DETERRENT 
TO TERRORISM.

THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS IN PARAGRAPH 3 
OF REFTEL (NOTE: OUR RECORDS ARE LIMITED AFTER THE EVACUATION 
IN 1998. END NOTE): 
 
A.  THE ONLY TERRORIST EVENT IN 1999 WITH A CONGO CONNECTION 
WAS UGANDA\'S BWINDI NATIONAL PARK HOSTAGE-TAKING AND MURDERS 
IN FEBRUARY/MARCH (ALLEGED GUERRILLAS KIDNAPPED US AND OTHER 
WESTERN TOURISTS IN UGANDA AND REPORTEDLY BROUGHT THEM TO 
CONGOLESE TERRITORY).  THE GDRC IMMEDIATELY PLEDGED ITS FULL 
SUPPORT IN THE INVESTIGATION AND CONDEMNED THE ATTACK.  IN 
THE END, LITTLE REAL ACTION WAS TAKEN SINCE THE ATTACKERS 
ESCAPED INTO REBEL-OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. 
 
B.  THE GDRC DID NOT EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN 1999. 
 
C.  IN GENERAL, THE DRC\'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS NON-FUNCTIONING. 
THE COURT SYSTEM LACKS EVERYTHING FROM TRAINED JUDGES, TO 
LEGAL TEXTS, TO CHAIRS.  A MILITARY TRIBUNAL HAS DISPENSED 
SWIFT AND ARBITRARY \"JUSTICE\" IN CIVILIAN CASES SINCE THE WAR 
BEGAN IN AUGUST, 1998. 
 
D.  IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE BWINDI PARK INCIDENT, 
THE GDRC OFFERED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND MADE 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONDEMNING THE ATTACK. 
 
E. THERE WERE NO MAJOR PUBLIC COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS TAKEN 
BY THE GDRC IN 1999. 
 
F. THE GDRC DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
G. THE GDRC MAINTAINS RELATIONS WITH SEVERAL NATIONS 
DESIGNATED AS SPONSORS OF TERRORISM, INCLUDING CUBA, IRAN, 
LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, AND SUDAN.  DURING 1999, PRESIDENT KABILA 
MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO LIBYA.  LIBYANS, IRANIANS, NORTH 
KOREANS AND SUDANESE ARE PRESENT IN THE DRC.  IT IS UNCLEAR 
HOW MUCH \"SUPPORT\" THE GDRC GIVES THESE COUNTRIES, BUT THEY 
HAVE ALL OFFERED ASSISTANCE TO THE GDRC. 
 
H.  THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE GDRC\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN 1999. 
 
I.  GDRC FAILED TO PROVIDE PROMISED INCREASED EMBASSY 
SECURITY DURING THE PERIOD OF HEIGHTENED PRECAUTIONS 
SURROUNDING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE EMBASSY BOMBINGS AUGUST 7, 
1999.

TERRORISM REPORT

THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS IN PARA 3 OF 
REFTEL: 
 
A.  DURING 2000, THE EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ANY ACTS OF 
TERRORISM THAT OCCURRED IN THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AREA OF 
THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC).  IN BUKAVU, SOUTH 
KIVU, THERE WAS A GRENADE ATTACK AT A CROWDED FESTIVAL 
DOWNTOWN THAT KILLED SEVEN PEOPLE AND WOUNDED OVER 100 ON 
AUGUST 26.  THE RCD-GOMA REBEL GROUP -- WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY 
RWANDA -- IMMEDIATELY BLAMED THE INTERAHAMWE FOR THE ATTACK. 
THERE WERE RUMORS IN BUKAVU THAT THE RWANDAN MILITARY WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK.  IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER THE 
RCD-GOMA AUTHORITIES CONDUCTED A CONCLUSIVE INVESTIGATION; 
EMBASSY IS UNAWARE OF ARRESTS OR PROSECUTIONS IN THIS CASE. 
 
B.  THE GOVERNMENT NEITHER EXTRADITED NOR REQUESTED THE 
EXTRADITION OF KNOWN TERRORISTS. 
 
C.  THE RULE OF LAW IS ABSENT THROUGHOUT CONGO AND THE 
JUSTICE SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ARBITRARILY, IF AT ALL.  THE ALREADY 
DECIMATED LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO ALMOST 
NOTHING DURING THE WAR WHICH BEGAN IN 1998.  THE MILITARY 
COURT CONTINUES TO TRY CIVIL CASES. 
 
D.  THE GDRC MADE NO STATEMENTS IN 2000 REGARDING TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS. 
 
E.  THE GDRC MADE NO MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS IN 2000. 
 
F.  THE GDRC DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
G.  THE GDRC HAS NOT MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF

REF: STATE 216032 
 
 
1. EMBASSY KINSHASA REQUESTS $131,100 FOR SEVEN SMALL 
DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS FUND (DHRF) PROJECTS IN FY 2001, 
PLUS AN ADDITIONAL $15,000 FOR UNIDENTIFIED PROJECTS, 
BRINGING THE TOTAL REQUEST TO $146,100.  THE LUSAKA PEACE 
PROCESS, INCLUDING PLANS FOR AN INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE, 
HAVE BEEN UNDERWAY FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WITH SOME PROGRESS. 
DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS CONTINUE TO SENSITIZE THE 
POPULATION TO THESE ISSUES AND TO PUSH FOR PEACE, 
RECONCILIATION, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE.  AS IN THE PAST, OUR 
FY2001 DHRF REQUEST PUTS A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON PROGRAMS FOR 
WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF CONGO. 
 
 
2. DHRF PROJECTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE WORK OF THE EMBASSY AND 
OUR MISSION OBJECTIVES IN THE CONGO.  GIVEN THE TENUOUS 
POLITICAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN CONGO, DHRF PROJECTS 
ARE MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER BEFORE.  SUPPORTING PEACE 
THROUGH THE LUSAKA PROCESS AND ENCOURAGING A DEMOCRATIC 
TRANSITION THROUGH THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE ARE KEY TO THE 
MISSION GOALS OF PROMOTING REGIONAL STABILITY AND DEMOCRACY. 
MOREOVER, CONGO HAS EXPERIENCED SERIOUS AND EXTENSIVE HUMAN 
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS, VIOLATIONS WHICH 
CONTINUE TODAY.  EMBASSY RELIES ON THE MANY HUMAN RIGHTS 
ACTIVISTS TO DOCUMENT THESE VIOLATIONS AND WORK TOWARD 
IMPROVING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE CONGO.  THERE IS 
ALSO A SERIOUS NEED FOR PROJECTS THAT EDUCATE THE POPULATION 
WITH REGARD TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.  DESPITE THE MANY 
RECENT CHALLENGES TO ADMINISTERING DHRF PROJECTS IN CONGO 
(REPORTED SEPTEL) WE REQUEST THAT THE DEPARTMENT GIVE EVERY

1. THIS IS EMBASSY KINSHASA\'S ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT FOR THE 
DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS FUND (DHRF).  EMBASSY\'S FUNDING 
REQUEST FOR 2001 PROJECTS FOLLOWS SEPTEL. 
 
 
2. POST REQUESTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE 
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CONGO WHEN EVALUATING RECENT 
DHRF PROJECTS.  ADMINISTERING THESE FUNDS HAS BEEN A 
CHALLENGE GIVEN THAT IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE EMBASSY HAS 
UNDERGONE TWO WARS, TWO EVACUATIONS, FOUR SELF-HELP/DHRF 
COORDINATORS, AND THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE EMBASSY.  AS A 
RESULT, IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO CLOSE THE BOOKS ON SEVERAL 
PROJECTS FROM 1996 AND 1997, PROJECTS THAT BEGAN PRIOR TO THE 
EVACUATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT 
RECEIVED FUNDING LOST THEIR RECORDS, WHICH MADE ACCOUNTING 
VERY DIFFICULT.  HOWEVER, EMBASSY HAS WORKED VERY HARD TO 
CLOSE OUT THESE PROJECTS AND IS PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE 
HAVE SUBMITTED TO USAID ALL DOCUMENTS NECESSARY TO CLOSE OUT 
PROJECTS PRIOR TO 1999. 
 
 
3. WE NOTE THAT IN 1998 THERE WERE NO DHRF PROJECTS IN THE 
DRC BECAUSE THE EMBASSY WAS CLOSED TEMPORARILY.  DUE TO LOCAL 
BANKING RESTRICTIONS AND INITIAL DIFFICULTIES GETTING FUNDS 
RELEASED TO PROJECT RECIPIENTS, EMBASSY HAS ALSO EXTENDED THE 
CONTRACTS OF 1999 PROJECTS.  TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROJECTS GO 
FORWARD SUCCESSFULLY, WE PLAN TO PAY VENDORS DIRECTLY FOR 
MATERIALS AND SERVICES THAT DHRF RECIPIENTS NEED IN ORDER TO 
CARRY OUT THEIR ACTIVITIES, THUS AVOIDING LOCAL BANKS 
ENTIRELY.  EMBASSY IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH USAID TO ENSURE 
THAT FUNDS ARE RE-ISSUED DIRECTLY TO VENDORS SELECTED BY DHRF 
RECIPIENTS.  WE INTEND TO FUND ALL 2000 AND 2001 PROJECTS IN 
THE SAME WAY.

PROJECTS ARE PENDING.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREEMENT 
DHRF-96-660-07, SIGNED WITH THE EMBASSY ON SEPTEMBER 25, 
1996, \"LIGUE DES ELECTEURS\" CONDUCTED TRAINING SEMINARS FOR 
ELECTION OBSERVERS AND DEMOCRACY \"ANIMATORS\" DURING 1997 IN 
SIX CITIES: MATADI AND LUOZI IN BAS CONGO, KIKWIT IN 
BANDUNDU, MBUJI-MAYI IN EASTERN KASAI, KANANGA IN WESTERN 
KASAI, AND KINSHASA.  THE NGO TRAINED 75 OBSERVERS AND 
ANIMATORS PER WORKSHOP USING DOCUMENTS SUCH AS THE UNIVERSAL 
DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  ELECTION TRAINING FOCUSED ON 
GATHERING CENSUS FIGURES, MANAGING POLLING STATIONS, AND 
TABULATION METHODS.  EMBOFFS AND THE DHRF COORDINATOR 
ATTENDED THE KINSHASA WORKSHOP AND WERE VERY IMPRESSED WITH 
THE QUALITY OF THE TRAINING.  ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NO 
ELECTIONS SINCE KABILA TOOK POWER IN 1997, THE TRAINEES WILL 
PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS AND DEMOCRATIC 
INITIATIVES IN THE CONGO.  FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE 
WORKSHOPS, LIGUE DES ELECTEURS PROVIDED EXCELLENT REPORTING 
TO THE EMBASSY.

SUBJECT: FOOD SUPPLIES ADEQUATE BUT EXPENSIVE AT YEAR END 
 
REF: 99 KINSHASA 8063 
 
 
Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: 
1.5(d). 
 
 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Food supplies in Kinshasa\'s markets are 
adequate as we approach the end of the year, and last year\'s 
experience of short supplies and price gouging will not be 
repeated.  Most basic foods are imported because of low 
yields and transportation difficulties for local crops. 
Importers and local producers report that the real problem 
this year is not availability but affordability, because 
consumers have extremely low purchasing power.  This growing 
impoverishment is also eroding the profitability of local 
businesses.  End summary. 
 
 
----------------- 
Last Year\'s Fears 
----------------- 
 
 
2. (C) Last year at this time the diplomatic community was 
concerned about social unrest associated with food shortages 
(Reftel).  The GDRC shared the concern and made a limited 
amount of official rate hard currency available to importers 
to supply Kinshasa with low cost food.  Predictably, the 
inadequacy of supplies of price-controlled staples generated 
large profits for middlemen and no benefits for consumers. 
Nonetheless, the Congolese public demonstrated its legendary 
stoicism and unrest did not materialize. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Local Production Hobbled 
------------------------ 
 
 
3. (SBU) The supply of locally-produced food is as poor (or 
poorer) this year as last year.  As recently as the 1980\'s, 
manioc provided half the calories in a typical Zairois diet. 
Manioc yields have fallen as much as 70 percent because 
failure to renew gene stock has allowed diseases to thrive. 
At the same time, the cost of transporting manioc from the 
fields to Kinshasa has skyrocketed (in areas where war has 
not completely cut communication) because of the 
deterioration of roads, the cost and spotty availability of 
fuel and the \"tolls\" demanded by security forces at 
checkpoints on roads and rivers.  A sack of manioc from Bas 
Congo cost 90 francs in December 1998.  Its price rose 800 
percent to 790 francs in December 1999 and has risen 900 
percent in the last year to 8000 francs.  (All estimates show 
that inflation has remained below 500 percent a year for the 
last two years.)  The price of locally produced corn has also 
increased faster than inflation: 800 percent in 1999 and 500 
percent this year. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
Imports Available But Expensive 
------------------------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) Despite promises to supply low cost food for the 
holidays, the government has not intervened in the markets 
this year, and consequently imported food is available but 
expensive in local markets.  Bread and rice are replacing 
manioc and corn in local diets, but calorie intake is 
declining.  A baguette of bread costs 20 francs, while the 
salary of an average civil servant is about 1000 francs. 
Bread is hardly affordable, but still easier to buy than corn 
or manioc. 
 
 
------------- 
Consumer Woes 
------------- 
 
 
5. (SBU) Most residents of Kinshasa struggle throughout the 
day to scrape up money to put a meal on the family\'s table. 
They buy their sugar by the teaspoon, instead of by the bag. 
Horse mackerel, called mpiodi in the DRC, is an important 
source of protein in the Congolese diet, and the market for 
mpiodi demonstrates the effect of declining purchasing power. 
 Mpiodi comes in three sizes: 16, 20 and 25 centimeters.  The 
25 centimeter mpiodi provides relatively more flesh (and less 
bone) than the smaller fish.  It used to be preferred in 
Kinshasa, despite a price premium.  Today, however, 16 
centimeter mpiodi dominates the market.  This is not because 
it is cheaper per pound.  The buyer of a 10 kilo box of 
mpiodi resells the fish individually.  There are almost twice 
as many fish in a box of 16 centimeter mpiodi as in a box of 
25 centimeter fish.  Even if the boxes cost the same, the 
unit price is lower for the smaller fish.  (Of course, the 
protein and calorie content is much lower too.)  The smaller 
fish better fits the daily budget of the average Kinshasa 
consumer. 
------------- 
Business Woes 
------------- 
 
 
6. (SBU) Revenues of local businesses have fallen along with 
the public\'s purchasing power.  During the Ambassador\'s 
December 13 Business Roundtable meeting, representatives of a 
package delivery firm, a local supermarket, a bank and a sack 
manufacturer complained about low volumes.  The largest local 
importer of frozen food quantified his company\'s pain for 
Econoff: receipts down 40 percent over the last two years.  A 
second factor which is hurting local food importers and other 
businesses linked to the food sector is the emergence of a 
formidable new competitor called Congo Futur, which has 
become the largest importer of food for the Kinshasa market 
in just two years (Septel).

SUBJECT: LOCAL IMPORTER SUSPECTED OF CRIMINALITY 
 
Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: 
1.5(d). 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Many long-standing Kinshasa businesses are 
complaining about Congo Futur, an importer that has expanded 
rapidly since it started operations less than three years ago 
and is now the largest food supplier in Kinshasa. 
Established businesses accuse Congo Futur of various 
illegalities.  Congo Futur\'s general manager claims his 
company has thrived because of its efficiency. End summary. 
 
 
------------------ 
We Need Protection 
------------------ 
 
 
2. (SBU) Manufacturers in Kinshasa have a long tradition of 
blaming their problems on low-priced imports.  At various 
times during the last year, local producers of textiles, 
batteries, razors, palm oil and flour have all briefed 
econoff on the unfair competition they face and the need for 
protectionist policy to preserve jobs.  This complaint has 
now spread to importers, and their accusations center on a 
company that has been doing business in Kinshasa for less 
than three years, called Congo Futur. 
 
 
3. (C) Business contacts say that Congo Futur has become 
Kinshasa\'s largest importer of dry staples (e.g. flour, rice, 
salt and sugar) and the second largest importer of frozen 
food.  Its volume has increased from less than 4000 tons in 
1998 to over 90,000 tons in 2000.  A manufacturer of sacks 
told the Ambassador that his largest clients, a local flour 
mill and the national sugar company, were reducing 
production, severely cutting his business.  The largest 
importer of frozen foods to Kinshasa told Econoff that Congo 
Futur had cut prices so far that he was being forced to sell 
below cost to stay in business.  He speculates that Congo 
Futur must be laundering money and/or trying to drive out 
competitors to secure a monopoly.  Other contacts acknowledge 
the weakness of these two hypothesese, since converting 
dollars to Congolese francs is an expensive laundering 
mechanism and low barriers to entry mean that a monopoly 
would provide at best small and fleeting profits.  They 
wonder if Congo Futur is buying diamonds or smuggling 
Congolese francs to rebel occupied zones, where the franc is 
worth almost twice as much as in Kinshasa.  All assume that 
Congo Futur has corrupted tax and customs authority. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
Customs Director Defensive 
-------------------------- 
 
 
4. (C) On December 13, the Director General of the Congolese 
Customs Agency, an Embassy contact who is generally 
considered a competent professional, called Econoff to ask 
her to come to his office.  Expecting a visa referral 
request, she complied.  Instead of inquiring about a visa, 
the Customs director said that he wanted to assure the 
Embassy that, regardless of what they heard, he had not been 
corrupted by Congo Futur.  He did not rule out the 
possibility that some of his subordinates were giving the 
company favorable treatment, and said he had initiated a 
discreet inquiry.  He implied that the subject required 
careful handling because of the possibility that powerful 
political figures were somehow behind the company\'s success. 
 
 
------------------- 
Congo Futur\'s Story 
------------------- 
 
 
5. (SBU) On December 15 Econoff called on Ahmed Tajideen, the 
General Manager of Congo Futur, to get his views on the 
Kinshasa market and his response to these suspicions. 
Tajideen was somewhat surprised at the Embassy\'s interest, 
but acknowledged that he was aware of the rumors circulating 
about his company.  After a nervous start, he seemed pleased 
to have the opportunity to explain how he operated. 
 
 
6. (SBU) According to Tajideen, Congo Futur is the subsidiary 
of an Antwerp-based family business called Soafrimex which is 
also a major importer in Angola, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, 
Ghana and the Gambia.  The company decided to move into Congo 
because it saw profit opportunity in the relatively high 
prices it saw in Congolese markets.  He attributed the 
company\'s success to a combination of efficiency and a high 
volume strategy.  To show the gains from efficiency, he said 
the company had lost 6 percent of the first shipment of food 
imported through the port of Matadi, presumably to theft. 
Congo Futur now has seven expatriate (Lebanese) employees 
permanently assigned to Matadi and theft loss is down to 0.5 
percent.  The company responded to the unreliability of 
transportation from Matadi to Kinshasa by establishing its 
own trucking firm, Trans M, and now owns 60 trucks. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Tajideen said that high volume gives his company a 
competitive advantage in transportation and allows him to 
make healthy profits with a small mark-up.  To demonstrate 
his transportation cost savings, he used the example of wheat 
flour.  He said that because of storage limitations, no one 
can import more than 5000 tons of flour to Congo.  A small 
shipload of flour might entail transportation costs of USD 60 
per ton.  His company loads a boat with 12,000-16,000 tons of 
flour, reducing transportation costs to about 35 dollars a 
ton.  The flour is shared between Soafrimex subsidiaries in 
Angola, Mozambique and Congo.  This means that his product 
delivered to Matadi costs at least 10 percent less than his 
competitors\'.  He then uses a 5 to 15 percent mark-up when 
the norm in Kinshasa might be 30 or 40 percent.  His vertical 
integration extends to the consumer market, providing further 
benefits; Congo Futur owns a bakery and indirectly owns a 
chain of retail outlets.  (One of the accusations of 
competitors is that bypassing the wholesale system is illegal 
in the DRC.  Tajideen acknowledged this when he said Congo 
Futur \"indirectly\" owns these retail outlets.) 
 
 
8. (SBU) Tajideen said that his attention to the market also 
contributes to his success; he said he spent most of the day 
out of the office gathering information.  Because even market 
middlemen are suffering declining purchasing power, he is 
bringing in goods in smaller sacks.  He is confident that the 
Kinshasa market is all about price, rather than quality, so 
he seeks out the cheapest rice available on world markets, 
instead of bringing in quality rice from Thailand.  Tajideen 
told econoff that he pays all his taxes and even pays a duty 
premium.  He said that Congolese customs authorities are used 
to seeing documents reporting a 20 percent higher cost for 
rice.  Instead of arguing with them about the actual price he 
pays for the rice, Tajideen said he pays duty based on this 
higher price. 
 
 
---------------- 
Are They Crooks? 
---------------- 
 
 
9. (C) Tajideen was animated and excited when talking about 
his business strategy and he convinced econoff that he 
aggressively pursues cost-savings.  It is hard, however, to 
dismiss the certainty of his competitors that his prices are 
patently below cost.  The Embassy FSN who arranged econoff\'s 
interview reported that Congo Futur runs a side business 
changing money at the parallel exchange rate.  He reported 
that people with money in hard currency bank accounts who 
transferred funds to Congo Futur accounts received either 
Congolese francs or dollar cash at a discount of 3 to 5 
percent.  The Customs Director\'s sensitivity also suggests 
that something more than just good practices underlies the 
company\'s success.  Post would be interested in any 
information Maputo, Luanda, Banjul or Accra might have on 
Soafrimex and its subsidiaries.

CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF JONATHAN PRATT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D). 
 
 
1. (U) IN A MOVE THAT MAKES KINSHASA RESIDENTS NERVOUS, 
PRESIDENT KABILA HAS APPARENTLY DECIDED TO REVIVE THE 
\"PEOPLE\'S SELF-DEFENSE FORCES\" (FAP), THE ARMED WING OF THE 
PEOPLE\'S POWER COMMITTEES (CPP).  KABILA FIRST AIRED THE IDEA 
OF ARMING NEIGHBORHOOD MILITIAS ONE YEAR AGO (REFTEL), BUT 
HAS NOT FOLLOWED UP ON HIS IDEA UNTIL NOW.  HOWEVER, DURING A 
PUBLIC CEREMONY ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14 AT NDJILI AIRPORT, 
VICE-GOVERNOR OF KINSHASA CHRISTOPHE MUZUNGU ANNOUNCED THAT 
PRESIDENT KABILA HAD TASKED HIM WITH REVIVING THE FAP. 
KABILA\'S MILITARY ADVISOR, EDDY KAPEND, WAS ON HAND FOR THE 
CEREMONY.  THE VICE-GOVERNOR TOLD THE CPP-ORGANIZED CROWD 
THAT PRESIDENT KABILA, IN REVIVING THE FAP, WAS DRAWING ON 
THE EXAMPLE OF VIETNAM \"WHERE DURING THE WAR EVEN OLD PEOPLE 
HAD TO BEAR ARMS.\"  FOLLOWING MUZUNGU\'S SPEECH, THE LEADER OF 
NDJILI\'S CPP REPORTEDLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD SPENT TWO 
MONTHS TRAINING THE NDJILI FAP AND THAT \"THEY WERE READY TO 
RECEIVE THEIR WEAPONS.\" 
 
 
2. (U) IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS SINCE THE CEREMONY AT NDJILI, 
MUZUNGU HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING ALL KINSHASA RESIDENTS TO 
REGISTER WITH THE FAP OUT OF \"PATRIOTIC DUTY.\"  AT CPP/FAP 
RALLY IN KINSHASA ON SUNDAY, MUZUNGU REPORTEDLY ANNOUNCED 
THAT 120,000 RECRUITS HAD ALREADY ENROLLED. 
 
 
3. (U) GIVEN THE TIMING OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT (RIGHT ON THE 
HEELS OF THE SIX-MONTH MONUC EXTENSION), SOME OBSERVERS HAVE 
SPECULATED THAT KABILA\'S REASON FOR ARMING THE FAC IS TO 
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SECURITY FORCES IN KINSHASA PRIOR TO A 
LARGER UN DEPLOYMENT.  VICE-GOVERNOR MUZUNGU DENIED THIS 
CLAIM IN A PUBLISHED INTERVIEW ON DECEMBER 18 WITH 
INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER \"LA REFERENCE PLUS\", EXPLAINING THAT 
THE PRIMARY REASON FOR ARMING THE FAP WOULD BE TO COUNTER THE 
RECENT INCREASE IN ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS BY SOLDIERS AND 
POLICE.  IN RESPONSE TO THE WIDELY-HELD BELIEF THAT ARMING 
THE FAP WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF WORSENING RATHER THAN 
IMPROVING THE SECURITY SITUATION IN KINSHASA, MUZUNGU ASSURED 
\"LA REFERENCE PLUS\" READERS THAT THE FAP WOULD BE VERY WELL 
TRAINED AND HIGHLY ORGANIZED. 
 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: KABILA\'S PLAN TO ARM THE FAP MAY FIZZLE THIS 
YEAR, JUST AS IT DID LAST YEAR.  THERE ARE ALREADY NUMEROUS 
ARMED SERVICES IN KINSHASA, WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF POLICE AND 
MILITARY FORCES ROAMING THE STREETS.  MOREOVER, IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT EVEN PRESIDENT KABILA WOULD GIVE 
WEAPONS TO PLAIN-CLOTHED CIVILIANS WITH AN AMBIGUOUS MANDATE. 
 THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FAP CAN MOST LIKELY BE VIEWED AS A 
PR MOVE INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE RESPONSIVENESS TO THE 
INCREASE IN ATTACKS BY SOLDIERS AGAINST CIVILIANS. 
 
 
5. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: IF KABILA DOES GO THROUGH WITH 
PLANS TO ARM THE FAP, KINSHASA RESIDENTS WILL NO DOUBT 
WITNESS JURISDICTIONAL BATTLES BETWEEN THE NEWLY-ARMED 
CIVILIANS AND THE POLICE.  AT THE END OF THE DAY, ANOTHER 
\"SECURITY SERVICE\" WON\'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF NON-PAYMENT OF 
SALARIES AND THE DISASTROUS ECONOMIC SITUATION IN KINSHASA. 
END COMMENT.

CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF JONATHAN PRATT FOR REASONS 1.5 (B/D). 
 
 
1. (C) MOST MAJOR OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE SAID THAT THEY 
WON\'T GO TO LIBREVILLE TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT KABILA ON 
DECEMBER 21, AND CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT ALL INITIATIVES FOR 
THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE SHOULD BE PURSUED WITHIN THE 
FRAMEWORK OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS. 
 
 
2. (C) DURING A MEETING WITH POLOFF DECEMBER 18, THOMAS 
OTSHUDI, LEGAL ADVISOR TO FONUS (NEW FORCES FOR UNION AND 
SOLIDARITY) PRESIDENT JOSEPH OLENGHANKOY, REPORTED THAT NO 
ONE FROM FONUS WOULD ATTEND THE PROPOSED SUMMIT.  HE CLAIMED 
THAT THE KABILA GOVERNMENT HADN\'T EVEN CALLED WITH AN 
INVITATION, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MEETING WAS ONLY THREE 
DAYS AWAY, AND ACCUSED KABILA OF ATTEMPTING TO CREATE THE 
ILLUSION THAT HE IS REACHING OUT TO THE OPPOSITION.  (NOTE: 
OLENGHANKOY IS ONE OF THE FEW OPPOSITION LEADERS WHO REMAIN 
IN KINSHASA, SINCE MOST OF THE OTHER MAJOR FIGURES HAVE FLED. 
END NOTE.)  OTSHUDI REPORTED THAT OLENGHANKOY WAS ADAMANT 
THAT ONLY DIALOGUE FACILITATOR MASIRE COULD CALL SUCH A 
MEETING, NOT PRESIDENT KABILA.  OLENGHANKOY\'S LEGAL ADVISOR 
ALSO OFFERED HIS VIEW THAT KABILA\'S PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION 
ON THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE HAD NO AUTHORITY UNDER THE 
LUSAKA ACCORDS TO BRING PARTIES TOGETHER OR EVEN PARTICIPATE 
IN THE DIALOGUE, SINCE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN 
NAMED BY KABILA HIMSELF. 
 
 
3. (U) OTHER OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE MADE THEIR POSITIONS 
PLAIN IN THE PRESS.  CHRISTOPHE LUTUNDULA OF MSDD (SOLIDARITY 
MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT) IS QUOTED IN \"LE 
POTENTIEL\" AS STATING THAT ALL INITIATIVES FOR A NATIONAL 
DIALOGUE MUST COME FROM WITHIN THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  THE 
DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY (PDSC) ECHOED THIS 
BELIEF IN A PRESS RELEASE.  ARMED OPPOSITION LEADER 
JEAN-PIERRE BEMBA HAS STATED PUBLICLY FOR SOME TIME THAT HE 
WON\'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY DIALOGUE WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION 
OF FACILITATOR KETUMILE MASIRE.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EPET, EMIN, KSAC, AMGT, PREL, CG 
SUBJECT: WEEKLY ECONOMIC REPORT - WEEK OF DECEMBER 11 - 
DECEMBER 17 
 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Gasoline and diesel prices rose on 
December 11, and public transportation fares went up 50 
percent on the 13th.  Kinshasa\'s motor fuel supplies 
were adequate but the GDRC twice closed service 
stations without providing advance notice, causing 
confusion. The Congolese franc weakened on the parallel 
market to about 130 Congolese francs per US dollar. 
Hewa Bora Airways acquired a Lockheed 1011 aircraft. 
Another new GSM cellular phone service was launched on 
December 15.  Two men were convicted of the December 
7th attack on Central Bank Governor Masangu in which 
his bodyguard was killed.  They were sentenced to death 
by a military court, and were executed in public, along 
with eight others, on December 14.  Inflation rose 
sharply following the increase in fuel prices and 
public transit fares.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
 
MOTOR FUEL 
 
 
2. (U) The price of gasoline rose from 45 congolese 
francs (fc) to 70 fc and the price of diesel fuel rose 
from 40 fc to 66 fc on Monday, December 11.  (On 
January 1, 2000, gasoline cost only 3.1 fc per liter; 
over the course of the year fuel prices have increased 
over 2000 percent.) Fuel stocks at SEP, the national 
distribution company, were adequate and no lines formed 
except on Wednesday and Sunday, when stations were 
closed. 
 
 
3. (U) Fuel supplies currently in Kinshasa came from a 
new supplier.  Rumors that this was a substandard 
product circulated throughout the city and were 
repeated in the press.  The GDRC closed stations on 
Wednesday in order to perform tests on the quality of 
gasoline.  The GDRC announced that the tests confirmed 
the quality of the product, although some contacts 
claim they also showed a lower lead content than past 
deliveries to Kinshasa. 
 
 
4. Sunday\'s closure is part of a new policy to reduce 
consumption.  Industry contacts believe this is 
appropriate, and say it was part of the package of 
measures attached to the price hike.  The GDRC, 
however, made no public announcement about the Sunday 
closure, leaving motorists angry and confused.  The 
price of black market fuel hit a new high on Sunday of 
about 200 fc per liter. 
 
 
MONETARY UPDATE/EXCHANGE RATE 
 
 
5. (U) The Congolese franc weakened on the parallel 
market to about 130 Congolese francs per US dollar. 
The official exchange rate remains 50 francs per 
dollar. 
 
 
TRANSPORTATION 
 
 
6. (U) Following the fuel price hike Monday morning, 
minibus and taxi owners kept their vehicles off the 
street pending a fare hike, leaving Kinshasa\'s 
commuters to make the long walk into the center city. 
On Tuesday evening, December 12, the GDRC raised public 
transportation fares 50 percent. 
 
 
7. (U) The delivery of new and renewed drivers licenses 
was halted when the company contracted to produce them 
ran out of necessary imported materials.  This follows 
recent similar interruptions in the supply of license 
plates and tax stamps. 
 
 
LOCAL ECONOMIC NEWS 
 
 
8. (U) Hewa Bora Airways (formerly Congo Airlines or 
CAL) acquired from Delta Airlines a Lockheed 1011 
aircraft for use on passenger flights to Europe.  A 
second L1011 will be delivered in the first quarter of 
2001. 
 
 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
 
 
9. (U) Cellular phone service provider SAIT launched 
its \"Oasis\" GSM service on December 15.  The GDRC\'s 
Office of Post and Telecommunications announced that it 
would provide cellular phone service in partnership 
with ZIDCO Holdings, a Zimbabwean company. 
 
 
SECURITY 
 
 
10. (U) On December 11 the Military Court sentenced two 
men to death for the December 7 attack on Central Bank 
Governor Jean-Claude Masangu.  (Masangu\'s bodyguard and 
another man were killed in the attack.)  On December 14 
eight convicted men, including the two convicted of the 
Masangu attack, were publicly executed as a warning to 
other undisciplined members of security forces. 
 
 
11. A local newspaper reported that Masangu was rumored 
to have offered his resignation following the attack. 
Masangu wrote a letter to the paper\'s editor denying 
the report and declaring his firm intention to continue 
to defend the Congolese franc and to fight against 
inflation.

SUBJECT: REFUGEE ISSUES IN GOMA 
 
 
REF: A. KIGALI 3122 
     B. KIGALI RW 3516 
 
 
Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: 
1.5(d). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: During her Nov. 26-Dec 1 visit to Goma, 
Econoff discussed refugee issues with Eddie O\'Dwyer, UNHCR\'s 
Acting Head of Field Office in Goma, and with Kasuku, a 
member of a Congolese NGO involved in repatriating Congolese 
Tutsis.  O\'Dwyer said that UNHCR and the Governor of North 
Kivu had overcome mutual distrust to implement a unique 
cooperative program to facilitate the return of refugees to 
Rwanda.  These flows amount to about 1500 per month.  O\'Dwyer 
said UNHCR was playing no role in the return of Congolese 
refugees.  Kasuku said that thousands of Congolese Tutsi\'s 
returning from Rwanda were desperately in need of 
international assistance.  End summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) On November 28 Econoff met with Eddie O\'Dwyer, 
UNHCR\'s Head of Field Office (Acting) for Goma.  O\'Dwyer 
explained that UNHCR had returned to the DRC in May of 1999 
with three missions: to repatriate willing Rwandan refugees; 
to reactivate tripartite cooperation with the DRC and Burundi 
to facilitate the repatriation of Burundian refugees; and to 
facilitate individual Congolese repatriations.  The climate 
at the time was one of mutual suspicion.  UNHCR feared that 
Rwandan Hutus were being forced out of Congo against their 
will.  The North Kivu authorities blamed the UNHCR in part 
for the disastrous consequences of the arrival in Congo of 
Rwandan refugees following the 1994 Rwandan genocide. 
 
 
3. (C) In the absence of UNHCR, the Governor of North Kivu 
was responsible for the refugee issue, and his office had 
based its operations on the premise that all the Rwandan and 
Burundian refugees in Congo needed to go home.  In October 
1998 the North Kivu authorities began a sensitization 
campaign to encourage voluntary repatriation.  When that 
didn\'t work, according to O\'Dwyer, the Congolese in February 
1999 began rounding up Rwandan hutus and sending them home. 
Between February and July 1999, over 13,000 Rwandans were 
repatriated.  After lengthy discussions, UNHCR began 
providing limited logistical support to the repatriation 
campaign in July 1999, in exchange for an opportunity to 
interview refugees and confirm that they were returning 
voluntarily.  In December 1999 this evolved into a formal 
partnership agreement.  O\'Dwyer said that 20 UNHCR staff 
members worked in the field with 80 employees from the 
Governor\'s office to coordinate assembly and transportation 
of refugees.  Since July 1999, on average, 1500 Rwandans have 
voluntarily returned home each month. 
 
 
4. (SBU) The Rwandan refugee caseload is a moving target. 
O\'Dwyer said that UNHCR had estimated that there were some 
40,000 Rwandan refugees in North Kivu in May 1999.  Today, 
despite 37,000 repatriations, UNHCR estimates that about 
40,000 Rwandan refugees remain in North Kivu. 
 
 
5. (C) O\'Dwyer said that most skirmishes between Interhamwe 
and RCD/RPA forces lead to the \"liberation\" of groups of 
refugees.  O\'Dwyer is convinced that these populations, while 
not precisely held hostage by the Interhamwe, are being 
intimidated into remaining in the Congo.  A journalist who 
visited a refugee processing station in December 2000 told 
Econoff that she met with a group of these refugees who had 
recently gained the liberty to make their way to the UNHCR 
site.  She described them as physically and emotionally 
exhausted, and she characterized their experience in Congo as 
a life of slave labor. 
 
 
6. (C) On November 27, Econoff met with Kasuku, Vice 
President of the local Chamber of Commerce and member of the 
NGO most active in repatriating Congolese Tutsi\'s from 
Rwanda, \"Tout Pour le Developpement\" (Ref A).  Kasuku was 
once the head of the North Kivu cattlemen\'s association, but 
he and all his fellow ranchers lost their livelihoods when 
the Masisi cattle herds were slain in the years following the 
arrival of the Rwandan refugees.  He said the Congolese 
refugees in Rwanda wanted to come home, but both the GOR and 
the UNHCR were holding them back.  He said Caritas and 
another NGO provide limited support, but Congolese Tutsi 
returnees desperately need more assistance.  Kasuku claimed 
that 8000 more Congolese who had recently returned from 
Rwanda had nothing to eat, and pleaded for USG assistance. 
 
 
7. (C) Econoff asked O\'Dwyer about TPD and reports that 
pecuniary motives underlay the NGO\'s effort to repatriate 
Congolese refugees (Ref A).  O\'Dwyer said that UNHCR\'s 
official policy is that the return of the Congolese refugees 
should coincide with the second phase of implementation of 
the Lusaka agreement. He said that in general the UN system 
provides the same assistance to repatriated Congolese that it 
provides to other internally displaced persons.  The 
exception is UNHCR, which has been forbidden by its regional 
office in Addis from providing Congolees returnees the 
plastic sheeting it offers other IDPs.  He believes that TPD 
is benevolent in its desire to help those who want to come 
home now, and does not think the NGO receives any financial 
benefit based on number of returnees.  O\'Dwyer criticized the 
site chosen to receive these refugees because it is on the 
border of Virunga park, which makes it vulnerable to 
Interhamwe raids.

1. (U) WITH BOLD HEADLINES, KINSHASA NEWSPAPERS ANNOUNCED 
DECEMBER 19 THE GDRC LIST OF PARTICIPANTS FOR THE 
\"PRE-DIALOGUE\" IN LIBREVILLE, PROVIDING THE STRONGEST SIGNAL 
YET THAT THE KABILA GOVERNMENT WILL ATTEND THE DECEMBER 21 
MEETING IN GABON.  INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER \"LA REFERENCE PLUS\" 
CALLED THE 201 GDRC-SELECTED PARTICIPANTS \"ILLUSTRIOUS 
UNKNOWNS\", NOTING THAT NO PROMINENT FIGURES FROM THE 
INTERNAL, EXTERNAL, OR ARMED OPPOSITION PLANNED TO 
PARTICIPATE.  PRESIDENT KABILA HAS NOT YET ANNOUNCED WHETHER 
HE WILL ATTEND. 
 
 
2. (U) THE LIST OF 201 NAMES, PRODUCED BY THE CONSTITUENT AND 
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY\'S SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR THE 
INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE, IS BROKEN INTO REPRESENTATIONAL 
CATEGORIES CLEARLY INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE BREADTH OF 
PARTICIPATION.  SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INCLUDING FOREIGN 
MINISTER OKITUNDU AND EDUCATION MINISTER YERODIA APPEAR IN 
THE CATEGORY TITLED \"NATIONAL DIRECTORATE OF THE CPP\" 
(PEOPLE\'S POWER COMMITTEES).  THE SMALL SECTION FOR POLITICAL 
PARTIES (ONLY SEVEN SPOTS) INCLUDES 5 UNKNOWNS AND TWO 
UN-NAMED UDPS PARTICIPANTS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT UDPS 
ANNOUNCED A BOYCOTT AND EVEN BREAK-AWAY UDPS PRESIDENT 
KIBASSA MALIBA ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULDN\'T ATTEND.  A WHOPPING 
SIXTY PARTICIPANTS WILL REPRESENT CONGOLESE CIVIL SOCIETY, 
BUT AS IN THE POLITICAL PARTIES CATEGORY, NONE OF THE NAMES 
ARE FAMILIAR TO THE EMBASSY. 
 
 
3. (U) PROMINENT OPPOSITION FIGURES CONTINUE TO INSIST 
PUBLICLY THAT THEY WON\'T GO TO LIBREVILLE.  RFI REPORTED 
DECEMBER 19 THAT BOTH UDPS PRESIDENT ETIENNE TSHISEKEDI AND 
FONUS PRESIDENT JOSEPH OLENGHANKOY HAD ANNOUNCED THAT THEY 
PLANNED TO BOYCOTT THE MEETING.  BOTH CITED THE FACT THAT THE 
LIBREVILLE MEETING FELL OUTSIDE OF THE LUSAKA PROCESS AS 
THEIR JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT ATTENDING.  (NOTE: TSHISEKEDI IS 
REPORTEDLY SPENDING THE WEEK TRAVELING TO AFRICAN CAPITALS 
INCLUDING LOME, LUANDA, KIGALI, KAMPALA, AND HARARE. END 
NOTE.) 
 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: THIS PROMINENT ANNOUNCEMENT INDICATES THAT 
THE GDRC MAY IN FACT SEND A CONTINGENT TO GABON FOR A 
\"PRE-DIALOGUE\" MEETING.  HOWEVER, SEVERAL QUESTIONS REMAIN, 
NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS HOW A LARGE GDRC DELEGATION WILL 
TRAVEL TO LIBREVILLE BEFORE THURSDAY.  MORE TO THE POINT, 
OBSERVERS IN KINSHASA WONDER WHY THE DELEGATES WOULD TRAVEL 
ALL THE WAY TO GABON GIVEN THAT NO RECOGNIZABLE MEMBERS OF 
THE OPPOSITION PLAN TO ATTEND, AND OUTSIDE FACILITATION WOULD 
THEREFORE BE OF LITTLE USE. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: WEEKLY MONUC PRESS CONFERENCE 
 
 
1.   SUMMARY: MONUC HELD ITS WEEKLY PRESS CONFERENCE ON 
  DECEMBER 20 AND DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF UNSC RESOLUTION 
  1332 TO THE PRESS. MONUC\'S MILITARY SPOKESMAN MADE TWO 
  ANNOUNCEMENTS. FIRST, MONUC HAS RECEIVED A COPY OF 
  ZIMBABWE\'S \"ORDERS OF DISENGAGEMENT\" IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
  THE HARARE SUB PLANS. SECOND, MONUC IS EXPECTING TO 
  RECEIVE A TEAM OF MILITARY PLANNING EXPERTS FROM NEW 
  YORK IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY WHO WILL ASSIST MONUC 
  IN PLANNING FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF PEACEKEEPERS. 
  AMBASSADOR MORJANE HIMSELF, ADDRESSED THE PRESS AT THE 
  END OF THE CONFERENCE. A COMPLETE TRANSCRIPT OF HIS 
  REMARKS ATTACHED AT THE END OF THE CABLE. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.   MONUC BEGAN THE CONFERENCE BY DISTRIBUTING COPIES 
  OF UNSC RESOLUTION 1332 TO THE PRESS.IN HIS REMARKS, 
  AMBASSADOR MORJANE SAID THAT UNSC RESOLUTION 1332 WAS A 
  SIGN OF THE UN\'S CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO HELP BRING 
  SUSTAINABLE PEACE TO THE DRC. HE STRESSED, HOWEVER, 
  THAT THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR BRINGING PEACE TO 
  THE REGION RESTED WITH THE BELLIGERENTS. HE REITERATED 
  THAT THE UN PEACEKEEPERS WOULD NOT DEPLOY UNTIL ALL 
  BELLIGERENTS DEMONSTRATED A CLEAR AND SINCERE DESIRE TO 
  BOTH RESPECT THE CEASE FIRE AND TO WORK FOR POLITICAL 
  AND DIPLOMATIC SOLUTIONS TO THE CRISIS. THIS WAS A 
  POINT THAT MORJANE CAME BACK TO AGAIN AND AGAIN DURING 
  THE Q&A. HE UNDERLINED THIS POINT BY TELLING REPORTERS 
  TO CAREFULLY READ PARAGRAPH 18 OF THE RESOLUTION, WHICH 
  CALLS FOR POSSIBLE SANCTIONS AGAINST NON-COMPLIANT 
  BELLIGERENTS. 
 
 
3.   WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE, 
  MORJANE SAID MONUC HAS NO MANDATE TO INTERVENE IN THAT 
  AFFAIR.  THE DIALOGUE, HE SAID, IS THE RESPONSIBILITY 
  OF THE FACILITATOR. MORJANE ALLUDED, QUITE STRONGLY, TO 
  THE, \"MANY PROMISES\" THAT HAD NOT BEEN KEPT AND SAID 
  THAT NO REAL SOLUTION TO THE CURRENT CRISIS WAS 
  POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL CONGOLESE. 
  (NOTE: THIS SEEMED TO A BE REFERENCE TO THE UNARMED 
  POLITICAL OPPOSITION IN KINSHASA WHICH HAS BEEN 
  EFFECTIVELY BLOCKED FROM ANY REAL PARTICIPATION IN 
  KINSHASA\'S POLITICAL PROCESSES.) 
 
 
4.   MONUC\'S MILITARY SPOKESMAN SAID A TEAM OF MILITARY 
  PLANNING EXPERTS FROM NEW YORK WOULD ARRIVE IN THE 
  FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY TO ASSIST MONUC IN PLANNING FOR 
  THE DEPLOYMENT OF PEACEKEEPERS. THIS TEAM WOULD INCLUDE 
  MILITARY PERSONNEL WITH EXPERTISE IN HELICOPTERS, RIVER 
  NAVIGATION AND LOGISTICS. 
 
 
5.   FINALLY, MONUC HAS RECEIVED A COPY OF ZIMBABWE\'S 
  \"ORDERS OF DISENGAGEMENT\" MANDATED BY THE HARARE 
  DISENGAGEMENT SUB PLAN. THE ORDERS ARE A MECHANISM FOR 
  DEMONSTRATING THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S ORDERS HAVE BEEN 
  PASSED TO, AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY, THAT COUNTRY\'S TROOPS 
  ON THE GROUND. MONUC HAD PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED COPIES OF 
  THESE ORDERS FROM NAMIBIA AND RWANDA. MONUC HAS NOT 
  RECEIVED COPIES FROM THE OTHER THREE SIGNATORIES, 
  ANGOLA, UGANDA AND THE DRC.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
6.   AMBASSADOR MORJANE WAS VERY DIRECT IN THE 
  INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S FRUSTRATION WITH THE BROKEN 
  PROMISES AND CEASE-FIRE VIOLATIONS COMMITTED ON ALL 
  SIDES. THIS MESSAGE BECAME PARTICULARLY STRONG DURING 
  THE Q&A. HE APPEARED TO PUT ALL PARTIES ON NOTICE THAT 
  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITYIS RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE. 
 
 
7.   A COMPLETE COPY OF AMBASSADOR MORJANE\'S REMARKS, 
  IN FRENCH, FOLLOWS: 
 
 
CONF. PRESSE/SRSG/DRAFT 
 
 
MESDAMES ET MESSIEURS BONJOUR, 
 
 
COMME IL EST DESORMAIS DE TRADITION, APRES CHAQUE 
REUNION DECISIVE DE L\'ORGANISATION DES NATIONS POUR 
L\'AVENIR DE LA REPUBLIQUE DEMOCRATIQUE DU CONGO, JE ME 
FAIS UN DEVOIR DE VOUS RENCONTRER POUR AVOIR UN ECHANGE 
AVEC VOUS SUR LE CHEMIN PARCOURU ET DEGAGER LES 
PERSPECTIVES EN VUE D\'UNE SOLUTION PACIFIQUE DU CONFLIT 
QUI NE CESSE D\'EVOLUER EN DENTS DE SCIE. 
 
 
NOTRE RENCONTRE D\'AUJOURD\'HUI PREND UN RELIEF 
PARTICULIER EN RAISON DU CALENDRIER QUI VOIT L\'ANNEE 
ACHEVER SON COURS. C\'EST UN MOMENT DE RETROSPECTIVE ET 
C\'EST EGALEMENT UN MOMENT FAVORABLE AUX GRANDES 
RESOLUTIONS. 
 
 
POUR NOUS, LA FIN DE L\'ANNEE SE PRESENTE SOUS DE BONS 
AUSPICES APRES L\'ADOPTION DE LA DERNIERE RESOLUTION DU 
CONSEIL DE SECURITE SUR LA RDC. L\'ONU A TENU A ENVOYER 
A TOUTES LES PARTIES UN SIGNAL FORT QUI EST 
L\'EXPRESSION DE SA DETERMINATION A NE JAMAIS ABANDONNER 
LA RDC A SON DIFFICILE SORT. EN AGISSANT AINSI, L\'ONU 
EST EN ACCORD AVEC SA VOCATION D\'ASSURER LA PAIX ET LA 
SECURITE INTERNATIONALES. ELLE REPOND AUSII A SON 
DEVOIR DE SOLIDARITE VIS A VIS D\'UN ETAT QUI SE TROUVE 
A LA CROISEE DES CHEMINS. 
 
 
A MON SENS, LA RESOLUTION 1332 DEVRAIT ETRE LUE COMME 
LA REAFFIRMATION DE LA PRIMAUTE DE L\'OPTION POLITIQUE 
ET DIPLOMATIQUE. PLUS QUE JAMAIS, JE DEMEURE CONVAINCU 
QU\'IL NE SAURAIT Y AVOIR DE SOLUTION MILITAIRE AU 
CONFLIT CONGOLAIS COMME JE N\'AI JAMAIS CESSE DE LE DIRE 
SUR TOUS LES TONS ET A TOUS MES INTERLOCUTEURS. 
 
 
C\'EST POUR CETTE RAISON, QUE JE DEPLORE LA CONTINUATION 
DES AFFRONTEMENTS ET APPELLE UNE NOUVELLE FOIS LES 
PARTIES A Y METTRE IMMEDIATEMENT FIN. C\'EST UN TRUISME 
DE DIRE QUE CHAQUE VIOLATION DU CESSEZ-LE-FEU ELOIGNE 
LES PERSPECTIVES DE PAIX. CHAQUE COUP DE FUSIL TIRE, 
PEU EN IMPORTE L\'ORIGINE, EST UN COUP PORTE A NOS 
EFFORTS VERS LA PAIX. C\'EST UN COUP DE FEU CONTRE LE 
DEPLOIEMENT. 
 
 
LA SOLUTION SE TROUVE DANS LES VERTUS DU DIALOGUE. EN 
D\'AUTRES TERMES, LE CHEMIN TRACE PAR L\'ACCORDF DE LUAKA 
ET ACCEPTE PAR TOUTES LES PARTIES SIGNATAIRES EST LE 
PLUS COURT ET LE MOINS ONEREUX VERS LA PAIX. 
 
 
COMME L\'A DIT LE SECRETAIRE GENERAL DES NATIONS UNIES, 
M. KOFI ANNAN, LES MESURES MILITAIRES NE POURRONT PAS 
AVOIR DES RESULTATS PROBANTS SANS LA PRISE EN COMPTE 
DES ASPECTS POLITIQUES TELS QUE CONTENUS DANS L\'ACCORD 
DE LUSAKA. 
 
 
EN ADOPTANT LA RESOLUTION 1332, L\'ONU FAIT UN PARI 
OPTIMISTE AVC LES DIRIGEANTS CONGOLAIS DE TOUS BORDS. 
C\'EST UN PARI SUR LEUR SERIEUX, LEUR INTELLIGENCE, LEUR 
LEADERSHIP, LEUR SENS PATRIOTIQUE ET LEUR CAPACITE DE 
DEPASSEMENT QUI EST LA MARQUE DE L\'HOMME D\'ETAT. C\'EST 
AUSSI UN PARI SUR LEUR DETERMINATION A PREFERER LE CHOC 
DES PROGRAMMES POLITIQUES AU CLIQUETIS DES ARMES. CE 
PARI EST A LEUR PORTEE. ILS PEUVENT LE GAGNER. 
EN ADOPTANT CETTE RESOLUTION, L\'ONU EST AUSSI EN PHASE 
AVEC LE RESTE ES ETATS MEMBRES DU CONTINENT AFRICAIN. 
TOUTES LES REGIONS DE L\'AFRIQUE SE SONT IMPLIQUEES DE 
MANIERE DIRECTE DANS LA RECHERCHE DE SOLUTION AU 
CONFLIT CONGOLAIS. 
 
 
LES CONSULTATIONS DES PARTIES CONGOLAISES AVEC LE 
PRESIDENT EN EXERCICE DE L\'OUA, AU TOGO, EN AFRIQUE DE 
L\'OUEST, LES SOMMETS D\'ALGER ET DE TRIPOLI EN AFRIQUE 
DU NORD, LA RENCONTRE ENTRE LES PRESIDENTS KABILA ET 
KAGAME AU KENYA, EN AFRIQUE DE L\'EST, LE SOMMET DE 
KINSHASA EN AFRIQUE CENTRALE, CEUX DE WINDHOEK ET DE 
MAPUTO EN AFRIQUE AUSTRALE MONTRENT QU\'AUCUNE REGION NE 
RESTE INDIFFERENTE A CE QUI SE PASSE ICI. CELA VEUT 
EGALEMENT DIRE QUE L\'AFRIQUE NE POURRA JAMAIS VIVRE EN 
PAIX TANT QU\'UNE REGION AUSSI IMPORTANTE QUE CELLE DES 
GRANDS LACS CONTINUERA D\'ETRE EN EBULLITION. 
 
 
C\'EST LE LIEU DE RAPPELER UNE EVIDENCE. LA BONNE 
VOLONTE DE L\'ONU, DES PAYS AFRICAINS ET DE LA 
COMMUNAUTE INTERNATIONALE NE SUFFIRA PAS A RESTAURER LA 
PAIX EN RDC. LA PAIX EST LA RESPONSABILITE PREMIERE DES 
CONGOLAIS. AUSSI IMPORTANTE QU\'ELLE PUISSE ETRE, NOTRE 
CONTRIBUTION NE CONSTITUERA QU\'UN APPOINT. 
 
 
C\'EST POUR CETTE RAISON QU\'IL EST D\'UNE EXTREME URGENCE 
DE REVENIR AU DIALOGUE POLITIQUE OU DE L\'INSTAURER AU 
PLUS VITE CAR LE CONFLIT QUE NOUS VOYONS SE DEROULER 
SOUS NOS YEUX VA AU-DELA DES LIMITES TERRITORIALES DE 
LA RDC. IL MENACE D\'EMBRASER LES PAYS VOISINS COMME LE 
CONGO-BRAZZAVILLE, LA REPUBLIQUE CENTRAFRICAINE ET MEME 
LA ZAMBIE. CETTE SITUATION NOUS PREOCCUPE LE SECRETAIRE 
GENERAL ET MOI-MEME AU PLUS HAUT POINT. 
 
 
LA REGION DES GRANDS LACS EST ENTRAIN DE DEVENIR LE 
VENTRE MOU DE L\'AFRIQUE ALORS QUE LES POTENTIALITES 
DONT ELLE REGORGE DEVRAIENT EN FAIRE UNE LOCOMOTIVES DU 
DEVELOPPEMENT AFRICAIN. 
 
 
L\'ANNEE AURA ETE UNE ANNEE PEU GENEREUSE DANS NOTRE 
QUETE DE PAIX. ELLE AURA ETE UNE ANNEE PLEINE DE 
PRESSIONS ET DES DEFIS. ELLE AURA VU UNE SUCCESSION DE 
FAITS ET D\'EVENEMENTS ALTERNANT LE DOUTE ET L\'ESPOIR. 
L\'ESPOIR AURA ETE LE PLUS FORT ET C\'EST LUI QUI NOUS 
LAISSE ENTREVOIR LA VICTOIRE DE LA RAISON. C\'EST MON 
VOEU LE PLUS CHER POUR 2001. 
 
 
AVANT DE PRENDRE VOS QUESTIONS, PERMETTEZ-MOI DE VOUS 
SOUHAITER DE BONNES FETES ET DE VOUS PRESENTER A VOUS, 
A VOS FAMILLES ET A TOUS CEUX QUI VOUS SONT CHERS MAIS 
AUSSI A TRAVERS VOUS A TOUT LE PEUPLE DE LA RDC, MES 
MEILLEURS VOEUX DE PAIX ET DE PROSPERITE POUR L\'ANNEE 
PROCHAINE. 
JE VOUS REMERCIE.

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT: TO PROVIDE VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN 
TAILORING AND START A POULTRY FARM TO PROMOTE

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT: PREPARING PREMISES OF A CONFERENCE 
CENTER FOR CIVIL SOCIETY WORKSHOPS, FOLLOWING LOOTING BY 
MILITARY IN JANUARY 1999 WHEN RWANDAN CIVILIANS WERE 
EXPELLED.  SSH OBJECTIVE: SOCIAL ASSISTANCE. 
 
 
2.  CRITERIA OBSERVED IN SELECTING THESE SSH PROJECTS: 
 
 
--  IN SELECTING THE ABOVE SSH PROJECTS EMBASSY HAS CAREFULLY 
CONSIDERED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THESE PROJECTS WILL BENEFIT, 
THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THOSE REQUESTING THE 
PROJECTS, AS WELL AS THEIR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE PROJECTS. 
THE MAJORITY OF THESE PROJECTS ARE AIMED AT IMPROVING 
CONDITIONS FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN.  WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN INTO 
CONSIDERATION THE NEED FOR LOCALLY PRODUCED FOOD THAT CAN 
GENERATE INCOME AND RESULT IN FOOD SELF-SUFFICIENCY. 
 
 
--  TWO PROPOSALS FROM OUTSIDE KINSHASA WERE INTRODUCED THIS 
YEAR.  WE ACCEPTED BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS, ONE IN BAS-CONGO 
AND THE OTHER IN EQUATEUR.  THE MAJORITY OF THE PROPOSALS 
COME FROM KINSHASA, HOWEVER, WHERE IT IS MUCH EASIER TO 
ADMINISTER PROJECTS DUE TO THE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS OUTSIDE OF 
THE CAPITAL CITY.  KINSHASA, WITH ITS GROWING POPULATION OF 
OVER SIX MILLION PEOPLE, HAS AN IMMENSE NEED FOR SMALL 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  OUR SEVEN PROJECTS ARE A DROP IN THE 
BUCKET, BUT WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD IMPROVING THE LIVING 
CONDITIONS OF THE APPLICANTS. 
 
 
3.  THE POPULATION OF THE DRC IS ESTIMATED AT OVER 50 MILLION 
PEOPLE.  THE POPULATION OF KINSHASA, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF 
THE EMBASSY\'S SSH PROJECTS ARE LOCATED, IS SAID TO BE 
APPROXIMATELY SIX MILLION.  POST\'S MISSION PROGRAM PLAN NOTES 
THE STRONG US NATIONAL INTEREST IN PURSUING HUMANITARIAN 
GOALS IN THE DRC, AND THESE SELF HELP PROJECTS WILL PROMOTE 
THAT US INTEREST.  USAID HAS A PRESENCE IN THE DRC.  THE 
PEACE CORPS DOES NOT HAVE A PRESENCE. 
 
 
4.  PREVIOUS POST ADMINISTRATION PERFORMANCE: 
 
 
--  FY00.  FUNDING FOR FY2000 HAS NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED 
(NEITHER BY THE EMBASSY, NOR BY THE PROJECT RECIPIENTS.) 
CONTRACTS FOR 2000 PROJECTS WERE SIGNED ON SEPTEMBER 22, 
2000.  DUE TO LOCAL BANKING RESTRICTIONS, WE PLAN TO PAY 
VENDORS DIRECTLY FOR MATERIALS AND/OR SERVICES NEEDED IN 
ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR PROJECTS. 
 
 
--  FY99.  DUE TO LOCAL BANKING RESTRICTIONS, FUNDS ALLOCATED 
FOR THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN SLOW IN GETTING TO THE 
RECIPIENTS.  CONTRACTS FOR ALL 1999 PROJECTS HAVE BEEN 
EXTENDED AND RECEIPTS ARE COMING IN.  ONE OF OUR RECIPIENTS 
HAS NOT RECEIVED ITS FUNDS.  HOWEVER, WE ARE CORRESPONDING 
WITH USAID CONCERNING THIS. 
 
 
FY98.  NO FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED DUE TO THE WAR AND THE 
EVACUATION OF THE EMBASSY. 
 
 
FY97.  TEN OF THE ELEVEN AGREEMENTS WERE LIQUIDATED. WE HAVE 
WORKED HARD TO CLOSE OUT THESE PROJECTS, AND ARE PLEASED TO 
REPORT THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO USAID ALL THE DOCUMENTS 
NECESSARY TO LIQUIDATE THE ONE REMAINING PROJECT.  ALL 
AGREEMENTS PRIOR TO 1999 HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND WE 
ANTICIPATE A FAVORABLE REPORT FROM USAID.

SUBJECT: MORJANE ADDRESSES DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY 
 
 
REF: KINSHASA 8455 
 
 
1. AMBASSADOR MORJANE ADDRESSED THE ENTIRE DIPLOMATIC 
COMMUNITY DECEMBER 21 TO SUMMARIZE THE POLITICAL/MILITARY 
SITUATION IN THE DRC AT YEAR\'S END, AND TO COMMUNICATE THE 
DIRECTION OF MONUC IN LIGHT OF UNSC RESOLUTION 1332. 
 
 
2. OVERALL, MORJANE VIEWED THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY IN THE 
DRC AS \"POSITIVE\" COMPARED WITH THE END OF LAST YEAR, AND 
SAID HE WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE RECENT SERIES OF REGIONAL 
DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT THE PEACE PROCESS -- MAPUTO 
I AND II; THE KINSHASA FRANCOPHONE CHIEFS OF STATE MEETING; 
TRIPOLI; THE LUSAKA JPC MEETING; AND THE RECENT SIGNATURE OF 
DISENGAGEMENT \"SUB-PLANS\" AT HARARE.  HOWEVER, MORJANE 
EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE THESE INITIATIVES \"COORDINATED 
TOWARD THE SAME GOAL.\"  MORJANE VIEWED THE CURRENT MEETINGS 
IN LIBREVILLE POSITIVELY AS WELL, BUT URGED THAT PARTICIPANTS 
IN THIS AND OTHER INITIATIVES MAINTAIN A COMMON POINT OF 
REFERENCE: THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  HE ALSO OBSERVED THAT ONLY 
THREE OF THE HARARE SIGNATORIES HAD ACTUALLY ISSUED 
DISENGAGEMENT ORDERS TO THEIR FORCES. 
 
 
3. WITH REGARD TO UNSC RESOLUTION 1332, MORJANE WAS PLEASED 
TO SEE THAT INITIATIVES HE HAD REQUESTED, AND HAD EXPRESSED 
DIRECTLY TO THE SECRETARY GENERAL, HAD BEEN INCORPORATED INTO 
THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION.  THE UNSC, HE SAID, HAD DECIDED 
\"TO GIVE THE PARTIES ANOTHER CHANCE -- TO PROVE THEIR GOOD 
FAITH.\"  HE SPECIFICALLY CITED UNSCR 1332\'S PROVISION FOR A 
POSSIBLE MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL WITH SIGNATORIES IN 
FEBRUARY TO REVIEW PROGRESS IN DISENGAGEMENT, DISARMAMENT, 
AND WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN FORCES. HE POINTED OUT THAT 
PARAGRAPH 18 EXPRESSED CLEARLY THE POSSIBILITY OF 
CONSEQUENCES FOR INACTION IN THE FACE OF MOUNTING 
\"INTERNATIONAL FRUSTRATION.\" 
 
 
4. MORJANE MADE A SPECIAL POINT TO EXPRESS HIS GRAVE CONCERN 
THAT ZAMBIA MIGHT BE PULLED INTO THE DRC CONFLICT DUE TO THE 
CURRENT FIGHTING ALONG ITS BORDER.  THE AMBASSADOR OPINED 
THAT THE CRISIS HAD REACHED A PARTICULARLY DELICATE MOMENT, 
AND SAID THAT \"ALL ACTIONS MUST BE BALANCED TOWARD A 
SOLUTION.\"  FOR HIS PART, THE SRSG SAID THAT HE PLANNED TO 
PUT A PERMANENT TEAM IN ZAMBIA NEAR THE BORDER IN VIEW OF THE 
SERIOUSNESS OF THE PROBLEM THERE. 
 
 
5. MORJANE FINISHED HIS ADDRESS BY LAUNCHING AN APPEAL FOR 
TROOPS TO REPLACE THE TWO BATTALIONS FROM PAKISTAN ORIGINALLY 
FORSEEN FOR THE DRC BUT SINCE SENT TO SIERRA LEONE. THERE ARE 
NOW, HE SAID, ONLY TWO BATALLIONS SLATED TO COME TO THE DRC, 
ONE FROM SENEGAL AND ONE FROM MOROCCO. 
 
 
6. AMBASSADOR MORJANE MADE A SPECIAL APPEAL FOR RIVERINE 
UNITS -- BOATS AND CREWS -- TO REPLACE THE ITALIAN UNITS 
(PROMISED BUT LATER WITHDRAWN) TO HELP REOPEN THE CONGO RIVER 
TO COMMERCE BETWEEN MBANDAKA AND KISANGANI -- TWO SITES 
SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED IN UNSCR 1332 (OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH 
EIGHT).  MORJANE SAID THAT HE VIEWS AS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL 
THE \"RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTACT AMONG THE PROVINCES.\"

KIVUS, HAD BEEN TRIED, SENTENCED TO DEATH, AND EXECUTED NEAR 
PWETO IN KATANGA.  FOR ITS PART, THE GDRC CLAIMS THAT MASASU 
IS ALIVE AND AWAITING TRIAL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (U) FOLLOWING HIS ARREST OCTOBER 31 FOR ALLEGEDLY PLOTTING 
A COUP AGAINST PRESIDENT KABILA (REFTEL), MASASU SPENT AT 
LEAST THREE WEEKS IN UNDISCLOSED GDRC DETENTION CENTERS. 
HUMAN RIGHTS NGO ASADHO RECENTLY PUBLISHED A REPORT ALLEGING 
THAT MASASU WAS DEAD.  THE REPORT, PUBLISHED IN EUROPE AND 
DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN IN KINSHASA, CLAIMS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT FLEW MASASU AND HIS FAC COLLABORATORS TO 
LUBUMBASHI AND ON TO PWETO THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 21-22.  THE 
REPORT FURTHER CLAIMS THAT THE FAC EXECUTED MASASU AND HIS 
COLLEAGUES ON THE 24TH OF NOVEMBER, AND ALLEGES THAT HUNDREDS 
OF OTHER FAC SOLDIERS, ALL FROM THE KIVUS AND SUSPECTED OF 
COLLABORATING WITH MASASU, HAVE BEEN EXECUTED HERE IN 
KINSHASA. 
 
 
3. (C) JEAN MARIE RUSIMBUKA OF THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE IN 
KINSHASA ADDED SOME DETAIL TO THE STORY BASED ON HIS 
DISCUSSIONS WITH MASASU\'S CONTACTS IN KINSHASA AND 
BRAZZAVILLE.  THESE CONTACTS CLAIM THAT MASASU WAS SPOTTED, 
BOUND, AT THE LUBUMBASHI AIRPORT AT 3 A.M. ON THE MORNING OF 
NOVEMBER 22ND.  ONE CONTACT OF RUSIMBUKA\'S, REPORTEDLY A 
CLOSE COLLEAGUE OF MASASU\'S KNOWN AS COMMANDANT BORA 
KAMWANYA, CLAIMS THAT THE FAC TOOK MASASU TO A MILITARY CAMP 
TWENTY FIVE KILOMETERS OUTSIDE OF PWETO.  ACCORDING TO 
RUSIMBUKA\'S CONTACTS, A MILITARY COURT JUDGE KNOWN AS 
COMMANDANT ALAMBA DECLARED MASASU GUILTY OF TREASON ON 
NOVEMBER 23 AND CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATH ALONG WITH 35 ALLEGED 
MASASU FOLLOWERS.  THIS STORY PARALLELS THE ASADHO REPORT IN 
CLAIMING THAT THE FAC EXECUTED MASASU AND THE KIVUSIAN 
SOLDIERS ON NOVEMBER 24TH. 
 
 
4. (U) THE FAC GENERAL HEADQUARTERS BROADCAST A PRESS RELEASE 
DECEMBER 16 CLAIMING THAT THE ASADHO REPORT WAS FALSE AND 
THAT MASASU WAS ALIVE AND AWAITING TRIAL.  HOWEVER, THE FAC 
HAS NOT ALLOWED ANYONE TO SEE MASASU. 
 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: THE ASADHO REPORT HAS PUT PRESSURE ON THE 
GOVERNMENT TO PRODUCE MASASU\'S BODY, DEAD OR ALIVE.  HOWEVER, 
AS THE GOVERNMENT IS APPARENTLY CONVINCED THAT MASASU WAS 
PLOTTING A COUP, AND IS EAGER TO CRACK DOWN ON PERCEIVED 
COLLABORATORS, NO ONE HERE IN KINSHASA HAS MADE MUCH NOISE 
ABOUT THE CASE.  LOCAL NEWSPAPERS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY SILENT 
ON THE MATTER, PRESUMABLY DUE TO THEIR PERCEPTION THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL RESPOND HARSHLY IF THEY GIVE THE STORY TOO 
MUCH ATTENTION. 
 
 
6. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: MEANWHILE, THE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE 
AFFECTED BY THE MASASU CASE CONTINUES TO EXPAND.  LAST WEEK 
HUMAN RIGHTS NGO ACTIVIST (AND FORMER EMBASSY IV PROGRAM 
PARTICIPANT) JEANINE MUKANIRWA WAS REPORTEDLY ARRESTED FOR 
HELPING AN ALLEGED MASASU ASSOCIATE CROSS THE RIVER TO 
BRAZZAVILLE.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) Retired Haitian General Herard Abraham phoned 
Ambassador Swing on December 21 to report the following: 
 
 
2. (C) Abraham said that a friend of his named Beaulieu had 
contacted him from Brussels seeking Abraham\'s support with 
regard to what his friend described as a desire by Congolese 
(DRC) President Kabila, that he and his Minister of State 
Kakudji be invited to the inauguration of President-elect 
Bush.  Kabila is eager, Abraham said, to establish good 
relations with the new US administration. 
 
 
3. (C) The Ambassador expressed a personal opinion that such 
invitations are extremely limited and the possibility of 
obtaining one highly unlikely.  The Ambassador agreed only to 
report the request to Washington for any appropriate action. 
 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: 
 
 
       General Abraham, who splits his time between Haiti and 
Miami (305-895-2354), was Haitian President Aristide\'s last 
Army Chief of Staff before the 1991 coup which overthrew 
Aristide.  Well respected, Abraham was a good contact of 
Ambassador Swing\'s during latter\'s service in Haiti.  How 
Abraham became a conduit for this reported request is

SUBJECT: KISANGANI OBSERVATIONS AND IMPRESSIONS 
 
 CLASSIFIED BY WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) (D) 
 
 
1. (C) The following two-part series reports on Embassy staff 
member\'s recent visit to Kisangani, capitol of Oriental 
Province.  Part one addresses the military and security 
situation, and Part two the political and economic issues 
facing Kisangani and the province. 
 
 
2. (C) Summary: During visit to Kisangani November 28 to 
December 1, Emboff spoke to local businessmen, 
representatives of international and local NGOs, and MONUC 
officers.  Although Kisangani has been calm for months, there 
has been fighting recently between RCD/Goma and MLC only 
sixty kilometers north of Kisangani.  Most viewed the 
situation as still inherently unstable and precarious, as 
access to diamond-rich areas appears to be a major objective 
of the different local military and political actors.  The 
\"governor\" of Oriental Province emphasized support of the 
Lusaka Peace Agreement, the Inter-Congolese Dialogue, and 
Congolese territorial integrity.  He urged the international 
community to pay more attention to Kisangani given its 
isolation and desperate economic situation, implying that 
there was a tendency to favor Goma and Bukavu.  The 
\"governor\" said that the USG could stop the war if it only 
wanted to.  Civil society reps say the \"governor\" has only 
very limited support in Goma. 
      Nearly all interlocutors in Kisangani had two 
complaints: (a) that the city had become completely isolated; 
and (b) that the province as a whole had been \"balkanized\" to 
a regrettably large extent. Travel around the province was 
virtually impossible, the province having become divided into 
many small \"spheres of influence.\"  These divisions had 
resulted in Kisangani\'s trade and communications options 
being cut off eastward as well as westward.  Within the city, 
the problems of Hema-Lendu tension and NGO tax harassment 
were cited. 
     The economy of Kisangani is in fairly dire straits, as 
both eastern and western surface supply routes have been 
completely cut and diamond trading has moved northward out of 
the city.  What little goods Kisangani is able to import come 
only via small planes from the east, or, in the case of 
agricultural produce, by canoe and bicycle.  Most of the 
diamond producing areas remain in MLC territory, and now that 
the Ugandans have moved north of Kisangani, this trade 
bypasses Kisangani, passing to Kampala via more northern 
routes.  As the diamond trade has been the basis for 
Kisangani\'s economy for some time now, the city\'s economy has 
collapsed, and money is in extremely short supply. 
     Civil Society members expressed gratitude to the US 
Embassy in Kinshasa for having issued them documents which 
facilitated their return to rebel areas after attending a 
civil society conference in Kinshasa earlier in the year. 
They were also appreciative that someone from the American 
government had visited, and hoped that this was the beginning 
of a closer relationship.  Finally, they were extremely 
gratified to learn that the US Embassy was very actively 
supporting the idea of the establishment of a \"humanitarian 
corridor\" along the Congo River between Kisangani and 
Mbandaka.  People proposed that in addition, an extremely 
beneficial and possibly more practical interim measure would 
be to broker the opening up of Kisangani and Goma airports to 
commercial and humanitarian traffic, an initiative that could 
potentially be monitored by MONUC.  End Summary 
 
 
Military/Security Situation 
 
 
     3. (C) Kisangani has not seen any combat in the city 
proper since the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan regular 
troops, after three violent confrontations between them in 
August 1999, and May and June 2000.  Notwithstanding, all 
agree that the security situation remains precarious and that 
a new round of fighting could break out again at any time--at 
least between MLC and RCD troops, if not by their respective 
Ugandan and Rwandan backers. (The population was seriously 
traumatized by the fighting earlier this year and remains 
very jumpy-ready to run into the forest with the first sound 
of gunshots.) 
     According to MONUC, both Rwandan and Ugandan armies have 
withdrawn to distances some 100 km from the city of 
Kisangani, in compliance with accords to this effect. 
However, as RCD/Goma-appointed authorities continue to 
administer Kisangani and the military force in and around the 
city are \"RCD/Goma\" troops, Rwanda maintains considerable 
influence in the city.  The local population, in fact, 
believes that many of the \"RCD\" troops are actually borrowed 
RPA soldiers.  They claim to see increasing numbers of 
obviously Tutsi soldiers, especially in the local drinking 
spots that used to be highly frequented by RPA soldiers when 
they were living openly in the town.  Kisangani residents 
have difficulty accepting that all these could possibly be 
\"Banyamulenge\" (or other Congolese Tutsis) as the RCD claims. 
 Uniforms are of little help in distinguishing soldiers of 
the different armies at this point, since many RCD troops 
have now been issued RPA-type uniforms.  Having no way of 
knowing who is Congolese and who isn\'t, MONUC officers say 
they have to accept the RCD\'s explanation that these Tutsi 
soldiers are Congolese and thus legitimate RCD regulars. 
     MONUC and local Civil Society groups assert that in many 
ways, the population was better off under foreign (Rwandan 
RPA and Ugandan UPDF) army control.  RPA and UPDF soldiers 
were regularly paid, relatively well disciplined, and 
supervised by a professional officer corps.  During that 
period, the unpaid, less-well supervised and relatively 
undisciplined RCD did not carry weapons.  The RCD troops 
were, however, issued arms by the RPA at the time of the 
RPA\'s withdrawal, and RCD soldiers now largely live off the 
population, confiscating food and other goods at will, 
especially in supply areas just outside the city. 
 
 
     4.(C) RCD and MLC Clash 
 
 
     In mid-November, RCD and MLC armies clashed north of 
Kisangani, on the road to Banalia and Buta.  There were 
reportedly three casualties and some wounded.  RCD forces 
captured approximately fourteen MLC policeman.  The 
skirmishes were apparently the result of an effort by RCD 
troops to extend RCD control to Bengamisa, a town 48 
kilometers from Kisangani and some 18 kilometers beyond the 
village of Lindi (which had hitherto served as the border 
areas of RCD control and MLC control).  According to MONUC, 
whoever controls the Bengamisa-Yangambi road is likely to be 
able to control diamond traffic from the diamond-rich area 
just north of Yangambi (approximately 100 kilometers west of 
Kisangani). 
     Some three hundred RCD troops, many of whom are Tutsi 
(and believed by the population to be RPA soldiers) suddenly 
moved considerably north of the city of Kisangani and crossed 
a river into the area north of Linda--normally territory 
controlled by MLC police.  Capturing MLC police on the other 
side of the river in a surprise attack, the RCD troops 
proceeded northward to capture Bengamisa, also protected only 
by MLC police and headed toward Balaia on the Aruwini River. 
At kilometer 62, however, they encountered the MLC army, 
which headed southward from Banalia upon learning of the 
invasion.  Some fighting ensued and went on intermittently 
for two days.  MONUC, which was able to reach the area of the 
fighting by the second day, had the impression that there had 
already been meetings between commanders on both sides and 
that some kind of a cease-fire/pull-back agreement had been 
reached.  This may have resulted from MONUC\'s earlier 
communications with RCD/Goma and MLC/Gbadolite alerting their 
respective leaders of the fighting and high potential for 
another catastrophic clash of rebel and supporting foreign 
armies.  RPA and UPDF troops reportedly remained at a 
considerable distance throughout the conflict and did not 
participate in these skirmishes.  In the pull-back agreement, 
however, RCD appears to have retained control of Benganisa, 
the town which may have been their original objective in the 
offensive.  MONUC and the population thus wonder whether the 
MLC might not as some point try to recover this territory and 
retaliate in an offensive. 
 
 
5. (C) Local Attitudes Toward MONUC 
 
 
     There is considerable concern among the international 
NGO community that MONUC will not be able to help them much 
if real trouble breaks out.  MONUC still has only thirty-five 
people in Kisangani, and they do not attempt to monitor the 
left bank of the river at all.  Some residents\' perception of 
MONUC as doing little to free Kisangani from rebel occupation 
leads them to the false conclusion that MONUC favors the RCD 
and Rwanda.  MONUC troops were not very visible in October 
when the university students went on a rampage in the city 
over school fees (which included throwing rocks at some of 
the headquarters of international NGOs.)  The international 
NGO community found itself largely on its own to attempt to 
ascertain what was happening.

CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 
(B) (D) 
 
 
1. (C) Following is the second and final part of a report on 
an Embassy staff member\'s visit to Kisangani November 
28-December 1.  This message covers the political and 
economic situation in Kisangani. 
 
 
2. (C) Political Situation 
 
 
       Emboff accompanied a Human Rights Law Group 
representative on a courtesy visit to the \"Governor\" of 
Orientale Province.  Making his case for US assistance, the 
Governor explained how the international community had 
ignored the province.  He stressed full support for Congolese 
territorial integrity and implementation of Lusaka.  Echoing 
a widely-held Kinshasa view, he asserted that the US could 
stop the war with a phone call if it really wanted to.  The 
presence at the meeting of the provincial head of security 
was interpreted by Civil Society officials as evidence that 
the governor is on shaky terms with his Goma mentors. 
(Kisangani Civil Society generally believes that Kisangani 
RCD officials are not completely trusted in Goma.  At any 
rate, they receive meager support from Goma.) 
     By all accounts, the Rwandan-supported occupation of 
Kisangani is somewhat less oppressive than in Bukavu and Goma 
although the population detests the RCD.  Human rights groups 
are strong and continue to have access to private local radio 
and television.  Few felt that there was much attempt to 
control communications.  On the other hand, the RCD is 
installing political \"cells\" in all businesses and 
institutions.  Emboff had no opportunity to speak with 
Archbishop Monsengwo, who was otherwise occupied the entire 
period of the visit.  The general impression was, however, 
that the bishop\'s popularity may have suffered somewhat as 
the population seeks greater signs of peaceful resistance to 
RCD occupation. 
     The Hema-Lendu conflict of Bunia in eastern Orientale 
Province has had repercussions in Kisangani, tending as it 
has to polarize the large numbers of the intellectual elite 
of both groups living in the city.  Despite human rights 
organizations\' reconciliation efforts, a high level of 
tension remains.  Both Hema and Lendu groups have been 
exciting their membership via use of video footage showing 
the bodies of their respective ethnic group being killed by 
the other. 
     The working environment for national and international 
NGOs in Kisangani is mixed.  There is considerable harassment 
in the form of petty taxes; as a result international NGOs 
recently formed a joint \"solidarity\" committee in order to 
confront the government with one voice.  The \"governor\" is 
not highly regarded among NGOs.  E.g., he reportedly tried to 
ensnare MSF/Belgium in a corruption scam.  Other 
international NGOs (ICRC, IRC, MSF/Holland, Oxfam) protested 
via a joint letter in support of MSF/Belgium, threatening to 
take the matter to RCD headquarters in Goma if necessary. 
 
 
3. (C) Isolation and \"Balkanization\" 
 
 
     Two themes recur in nearly all discussions with Civil 
Society and others in Kisangani: first, that Kisangani is 
isolated, effectively cut off from the rest of the Congo both 
east and west, as well as largely ignored by the rest of the 
world.  From the \"governor\" on down, everyone in Kisangani 
bemoaned this and expressed appreciation for foreigners who 
now come for more than a same day visit.  Kisangani\'s pride 
is hurt, as residents have watched the Congo\'s third largest 
city become something of a backwater village neglected by 
politicians, humanitarian aid workers, development agencies, 
and diplomats.  All pointed out repeatedly that Goma and 
Bukavu get all the attention. Notwithstanding, the visitor 
found Kisangani far from \"dead\", but rather surprisingly 
vibrant for a community with so few resources and outside 
connections. 
     The second common strain of most conversations in 
Kisangani is the perceived \"balkanization\" of the province. 
Residents are bitter and resentful that the international 
community seemed to be doing nothing to prevent this.  They 
can no longer travel freely around the province, both because 
of a pre-travel authorization requirement and because of 
security.  (To travel to Buta, for example, one needs to 
leave RCD/Goma territory and enter MLC territory.  To travel 
to Bunia, one needs to enter the \"RCD-National\" territory of 
Roger Lumbala and then navigate through the territories of 
the three competing rebel groups in the Bunia-Butembo-Beni 
area.)  It is obvious to local residents that Orientale 
province has ceased being a province and deteriorated into a 
number of fiefdoms dominated by various strongmen (including 
Ugandans and Rwandans). 
 
 
4. (C) Economic Situation 
 
 
     As throughout the Congo, these are very hard times 
economically for Kisangani.  Kisangani suffers more from the 
war than do some other areas in that the armed conflict has 
cut off the city from all of its major trade partners.  E.g., 
there has been no river traffic with Mbandaka and Kinshasa to 
the west for two years now, with major economic 
repercussions.  Though the city is commonly thought of as 
being commercially and politically more tied to the east than 
to the west, local traders suggest that this is largely a 
misconception, since all of Kisangani\'s major commercial 
enterprises traded more with Kinshasa than with the east, 
taking advantage of lower-cost river transportation.  The 
only river traffic now are canoes that come upstream with 
limited agricultural produce.  Even these, however, have 
diminished greatly in number, as the number of \"roadblocks\" 
for \"taxes\" on the river has blossomed (fifteen or so between 
Kisangani and Bumba, and three between Yangambi and Kisangani 
alone), making this route no longer profitable for even 
small-time traders.  To the north and east, roads are 
insecure and in poor condition.  There the frequency of 
trucks being ambushed has caused vehicular traffic to 
disappear completely.  This limits Kisangani to dependence 
either on bicycle transporters or aircraft from the east for 
virtually everything but locally-available agricultural 
produce.  Few companies in the east have attempted 
large-scale importing, however, perhaps for lack of large 
aircraft.  As a result, according to an OCHA investigation, 
food prices in Kisangani are considerably higher than in Goma. 
 
 
5. Diamond Trade Moves Away 
 
 
     Interlocuteurs repeatedly pointed out to Emboff that the 
diamond trade which traditionally constituted the city\'s 
economic base has moved away from Kisangani.  A little-known 
consequence of the Rwanda-Uganda \"six-day\" war in Kisangani 
and the subsequent withdrawal of the Ugandans is that 
although Kisangani itself remained in the RCD/Goma (i.e. 
Rwandan) sphere of influence, the Ugandans retained control 
of most of the diamond-producing areas, which lie to the 
northeast and northwest of the city.  As diamonds now go out 
directly via northern routes to Kampala, Kisangani is largely 
bereft of the diamond trade.  The Kisangani diamond trader 
who received an RCD monopoly on diamond exports eventually 
gave up and left town because he could not raise enough 
revenue from new diamonds to pay $100,000 in monthly taxes 
required in return for the monopoly.  Many believe that 
Kisangani\'s inaccessibility to diamond revenue may have been 
the underlying reason that the RCD sent troops into MLC 
territory in mid-November.  As is often reported of areas 
where Rwandan soldiers control diamond-producing areas, 
Ugandan soldiers do not pay appropriate prices for diamonds. 
Diggers are forced to sell only to Ugandans who conspire to 
keep prices low.  Civil Society leaders in Kisangani also 
suspect that coltan and niobium are also being exported in 
significant quantities from Orientale Province directly to 
Uganda and Rwanda.

TAGS: EAID, ECON, PGOV, CG 
SUBJECT: VIEWS OF GOMA UN WORKERS 
 
 
Classified by Economic Officer Katherine Simonds.  Reason: 
1.5(d). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Representatives of UN agencies in Goma 
believe the international community in general and the UN in 
particular are overly focused on the Congo war instead of on 
the deeper rooted problems of the Congo.  While their 
analysis may in part reflect their own tunnel vision, it 
strongly suggests that ending the war will not end the need 
for continued intense international involvement in the Congo. 
 On the other hand, in our view, unless the war is ended, 
even unlimited international engagement will not be able to 
solve the sub-region\'s problems.  End summary. 
 
 
2. (C) Econoff\'s five day visit to Goma provided ample 
opportunity for conversations with a wide range of officers 
representing UN agencies in Goma.  Econoff found them to be 
dedicated, professional, well-informed and well-coordinated. 
They form a close-knit community that has developed its own 
analysis of the crisis in the Kivus based on their day-to-day 
experience and they feel alienated from their head offices in 
Kinshasa.  Not surprisingly, they believe the resources they 
have are inadequate to the task they face (a situation which 
the UN acknowledges in its Consolidated Appeal for the DRC). 
More disturbingly, however, they also feel hobbled by their 
head offices in their ability to fulfill their basic 
humanitarian mission.  This \"malaise\" (which caused the 
resignation of OCHA\'s respected Goma coordinator) is shared 
in different degrees by many UN officers working in Goma. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
Clashes with Kinshasa Home Offices 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
3. (C) Charles Petrie, the departing OCHA coordinator, 
devoted a significant amount of time over his last few days 
in Goma to briefing Econoff on the complicated humanitarian 
crisis in the Kivus.  Although he did not volunteer the 
information, he responded frankly when asked why he was 
leaving the UN.  He told Econoff he was tired of being 
considered the enemy by Kinshasa.  (Asked what he meant by 
Kinshasa, Petrie specified the UN system.  Petrie said that 
his criticism of the UN in Kinshasa did not, however, extend 
to MONUC or the SRSG.)  He said he and his colleagues had 
been arguing for more than a year that a concerted effort to 
promote reconciliation at the grassroots level in the Kivus 
was crucial to avoid an escalation of violence.  Their advice 
had been ignored, and they had been forced to watch as the 
number of internally displaced in North Kivu rose by 700,000 
in the last year and 3-400,000 in the last few months. 
Petrie said that the final straw motivating him to resign was 
the accusation by UN colleagues in Kinshasa that he had 
ghost-written the USG non-paper on the humanitarian crisis in 
the DRC. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
\"Pacification\"--A Question of Definition 
---------------------------------------- 
4. (C) A Goma-based UNHCR officer told Econoff that, in 
recognition of the need to promote tolerance, the UN had 
finally adopted a policy requiring that all development 
projects contain a human rights component.  He referred to 
this as a pacification campaign, and was surprised to be told 
that, for an American, \"pacification\" implied encouraging the 
population to accept the RCD/Rwandan administration.  For him 
pacification referred to relations within the community of 
Congolese civilians. 
 
 
5. (C) Conflicting interpretations of the word pacification 
symbolize the gulf between the UN\'s Goma officers and their 
colleagues in Kinshasa.  Officers in Goma generally agree 
that the current war is fundamentally a Rwandan invasion, and 
that the RCD is a largely incompetent and extremely unpopular 
puppet regime.  They believe, however, that there are ethnic 
differences (such as the Hema-Lendu conflict) which, though 
they may have been aggravated by the war, long predate it. 
They believe that a combination of development projects and 
\"pacification\" can help communities of Congolese to live 
together peacefully, both in the current context and longer 
term. 
 
 
----------------- 
NGOs and Politics 
----------------- 
 
 
6. (C) Bukavu civil society is a prime candidate for this 
human rights training, according to most UN officers in Goma. 
 They repeatedly told econoff that the RCD\'s ban on political 
parties has turned politicians into NGO leaders.  Purported 
human rights NGOs in Bukavu really pursue political agendas, 
and these often include ethnically divisive policies.  Petrie 
noted that the Swedes and the Dutch have stopped funding 
Bukavu\'s civil society organizations for this reason.  The 
UNHCR representative said he was trying to convince Human 
Rights NGO\'s that they should preserve their credibility and 
stop publishing undocumented and often wildly inflated 
accounts of violations, such as the Katagota massacre.  (He 
said that he believed a serious massacre of perhaps 40 
civilians had indeed occurred at Katagota, but that civil 
society undermined its own interests by publishing accounts 
claiming up to 400 victims.)  UN officers also believe that 
political activism in Bukavu is exacerbating the economic 
deprivation of residents of South Kivu by, for example, 
declaring lengthy general strikes (villes mortes) which close 
the markets in which many of the poor earn their daily living. 
 
 
---------------- 
A Plea for Roads 
---------------- 
 
 
7. (C) Many of Econoffs Goma interlocutors, including UN 
officers, said they believe the international community 
should put more resources into road reconstruction in the 
Kivus.  They believe better roads will immediately improve 
the economic situation of rural communities by providing 
access to markets, and that reducing economic deprivation 
will reduce ethnic rivalry for scarce resources.  They also 
believe that reducing the isolation of ethnically homogeneous 
communities will promote tolerance. 
 
 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
8. (C) From a distance, and with the cultural baggage of a 
typical American, the resistance of Bukavu\'s civil society is 
an admirable and appropriate response to occupation.  Calls 
for road-building and pacification campaigns sound like 
collaboration.  The near-unanimous and sincere arguments put 
forward by UN officers in Goma, however, merit attention. 
They at least suggest that, while currently focusing on 
initiatives to end the Congo war, the international community 
needs to prepare itself for a long and deep involvement in 
the reconstruction of the Congo once the war is over.  In the 
short term, however, ending the war remains the sine qua non 
for resolving the Congo crisis.

SUBJECT: WEEKLY ECONOMIC REPORT - WEEK OF DECEMBER 18 - 
DECEMBER 24 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Gasoline and diesel supplies were 
adequate in Kinshasa, though reports that current 
supplies are noxious persisted. The Congolese franc 
weakened on the parallel market to about 142 Congolese 
francs per US dollar.  The GDRC held a week-long 
workshop on the conditions of state-owned companies. 
The governments of the RDC and Congo-Brazzaville agreed 
that debt payments from Congo-B for electricity would 
go toward construction of a new high voltage line from 
the Inga Dam.  The press continued to report that 
diamond markets are depressed because the company with 
an exclusive export license is not interested in buying 
industrial diamonds and not capable of buying all gem- 
quality stones.  The Honorary Consul of Cyprus was 
caught with a packet of rough diamonds in her hand 
luggage as she waited in the diplomatic lounge at 
Kinshasa\'s airport for a flight to Brussels.  Inflation 
slowed from last week\'s torrid pace, although merchants 
raised clothing prices in advance of the holidays. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
MOTOR FUEL 
 
 
2. (U) Fuel supplies were adequate and no long lines 
formed at service stations.  Stations were once again 
closed on Sunday to reduce fuel consumption, but 
reopened on Monday, despite the Christmas holiday. 
 
 
3. (U) Rumors that current fuel stocks are substandard 
continued to circulate, and the press reported that 
noxious fumes from fuel tanks sickened many people. 
 
 
MONETARY UPDATE/EXCHANGE RATE 
 
 
4. (U) The Congolese franc weakened on the parallel 
market to about 142 Congolese francs per US dollar. 
This surprised many observers who are accustomed to see 
the franc strengthen at the end of the year because 
employers need francs to pay the traditional bonus of 
one month\'s salary.  The official exchange rate remains 
50 francs per dollar. 
 
 
MINING NEWS 
 
 
5. (U) Diamond sector representatives continued to 
complain about the exclusive export license granted to 
Israeli firm IDI diamonds.  The press reported that 
diamond markets are depressed because IDI is not 
interested in buying industrial diamonds and not 
capable of buying all gem-quality stones. 
 
 
6. (U) The Honorary Consul of Cyprus was caught with a 
packet of rough diamonds in her hand luggage as she 
waited in the diplomatic lounge at Kinshasa\'s airport 
for a flight to Brussels.  The incident recalled the 
uproar when the Ambassador of Togo was caught smuggling 
Congolese francs to Brazzaville. 
 
 
LOCAL ECONOMIC NEWS 
 
 
7. (U) The GDRC held a week-long workshop on the 
country\'s state-owned companies.  In his opening 
remarks, the Minister for State Enterprise said the 
goal of the exercise was threefold: to prepare a 
diagnosis of the state of the parastatals; to identify 
the current and more remote causes of the problems 
identified; and to propose solutions that would permit 
the state-owned sector to play the key role in 
development that it played during the colonial era. 
Officials from one of the companies represented at the 
workshop, the Kisenge manganese mine, noted that their 
mine had produced nothing since the railroad serving 
the mine closed 25 years ago.  Individual state 
enterprises estimated the investment that would be 
required to rehabilitate their facilities.  The post 
office/national phone company reported it needed a 
relatively modest USD 38 million.  By contrast, 
Kinshasa\'s International Fairgrounds claims it requires 
a whopping USD 92 million. 
 
 
8. (U) The governments of the two Congos announced they 
had reached an agreement on the repayment of USD 28 
million that Congo-Brazzaville owes the DRC for 
electricity.  The funds will be set aside to construct 
a second high voltage line from the Inga dam.  The head 
of the DRC\'s electricity parastatal told the press 
that, with funding for over half of the line\'s USD 50 
million cost already identified, the rest of the 
necessary financing would be easy to obtain.

Comparison of Embassy inflation statistics with 
statistics from the Congolese Central Bank and the 
Institute for Social and Economic Research show 
discrepancies; the Embassy\'s estimate was significantly 
lower for 1999 and has been consistently higher in 
2000.  Examination of the methodology used in Embassy 
estimates reveals that weightings in the market basket 
have not been altered for almost ten years.  As a 
result of changes in relative prices over the years, 
the Embassy estimate has evolved to place an 
increasingly heavy weight on some factors (notably 
transportation) and an increasingly light weight on 
other factors (notably food).  Starting in January, the 
Embassy will adjust its weighting scheme to return to 
the relative weights used in 1991.

1. (C) Goma is not a very political town, despite its status 
as administrative headquarters for the RCD.  While numerous 
general strikes (villes mortes) closed down Bukavu for days 
at a time over the last year, in Goma only one part of the 
city shut down and that for only one day.  Residents of Goma, 
like their countrymen in Kinshasa, are focussed on survival. 
However unhappy they may be with the authorities, they devote 
their energy to getting through each day, rather than to 
political activity.  Nevertheless, during Econoff\'s five-day 
visit to Goma, political themes arose.  This cable (the last 
of the series of reports on the visit) covers political 
issues, including: impressions of the RCD; the absence of 
concrete signs that Rwanda ultimately intends to annex the 
Kivus; the attitudes of Goma residents toward Kabila and 
Kinshasa; and the aborted attempt by a prominent businessman 
to form a new political party.  This cable also touches on 
security issues. 
 
 
---------------------- 
Impressions of the RCD 
---------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) RCD leaders were eager to meet with Econoff.  The 
RCD\'s Director of External Relations (equivalent to Minister 
of Foreign Affairs) immediately returned econoff\'s call 
although he was at the airport departing for a Joint 
Political Committee meeting.  He asked her to meet with his 
deputy.  The deputy insisted on arranging meetings with the 
RCD\'s Directors of Mines, Finance and Economy, and all three 
made time for the meetings, despite the fact that most of 
their week was taken up with a general meeting of party 
leaders.  Even Secretary General Ruberwa tried to arrange a 
meeting with econoff. 
 
 
3. (C) The RCD met 6-8 hours a day for three days during 
econoffs visit to formulate an action plan for the party. 
The business community was scornful of the meetings and of 
the RCD in general.  They note that the party has a penchant 
for long meetings that produce little; the RCD met for almost 
a full month soon after it was formed.  Business contacts 
concede that the recent cabinet shuffle (Ref A) improved the 
quality of RCD department heads, but believe that any effort 
at good governance currently underway is too little and too 
late to earn the party popular support.  Many of the people 
with whom econoff discussed the RCD\'s new policy for coltan 
exports (Ref B) are confident that the RCD will back down 
under pressure, as, they say, it has done several times in 
the past. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
Congolese Institutions Remain 
----------------------------- 
 
 
4. (C) While Rwanda clearly runs the RCD and, through the 
RCD, the Kivus, they have not altered the basic Congolese 
structure of governance.  There is no obvious displacement of 
Congolese institutions by Rwandan institutions, which might 
be expected if Rwanda\'s plans include future annexation of 
the Kivus, as some believe.  Both the RCD\'s Director of 
Finance and the local coordinator of the electricity 
parastatal SNEL briefed econoff on the administrative 
structure of enterprises under their control.  The Finance 
Director said that the RCD controlled parts of eight 
different provinces.  In each province, a governor and 
various state services (e.g. customs and other revenue 
agencies) operate, in accordance with Congolese law.  He said 
all are officially subservient to Kinshasa, but the RCD has 
appointed a coordinator for each agency to control things 
until Kinshasa can take over once again.  The SNEL 
coordinator described his role in similar terms. 
 
 
-------------------- 
Nostalgia for Kabila 
-------------------- 
 
 
5. (C) People from all levels of society in Goma were 
interested to hear how things are going in Kinshasa.  Both 
affluent and average Gomans asked about the dollar-franc 
exchange rate in Kinshasa (which is about twice as high as in 
Goma).  Several people told econoff they had heard there was 
\"famine\" in Kinshasa.  Although Goma suffered some severe 
looting when the AFDL arrived, casual conversation suggests 
that Kabila is popular in Goma.  He gets credit for helping 
to get rid of the refugees who destroyed the local economy. 
A couple of contacts told econoff that there was a brief 
respite from the fear of victimization under Kabila.  One 
commented that for about a year, soldiers got paid, and 
didn\'t need to rob the populace in order to survive.  Another 
commented that the AFDL had executed a few thieves when it 
came through Goma, and subsequently banditry stopped.  There 
is no nostalgia for Mobutu, and his luxurious former 
residence (which now houses RCD offices) is known locally as 
the Museum of Shame. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
Birth and Death of a Party 
-------------------------- 
 
 
6. (C) Victor Ngezayo told econoff about his attempt to form 
a political party, the Congolese Patriotic Movement (MPC) 
(Ref C).  He said he founded the party to create a voice for 
good governance and tolerance.  He believes that the 
Congolese have no faith in democracy and expect nothing from 
government because they have been burdened for 40 years by a 
dysfunctional system.  To launch the MPC, he held a nine-day 
workshop open to everyone, including RCD and Mai Mai, to 
discuss the nature of the current crisis and to look for ways 
to end the war.  Ngezayo sent the declaration the workshop 
produced to the RCD.  His cover letter was conciliatory, 
noting that the MPC shared the values and motivations that 
inspired the RCD\'s 1998 rebellion. 
 
 
7. (C) Ngezayo said that the MPC\'s declaration, which was 
released on the same day the RCD restructured (Ref A), was 
seen as sabotage by party leaders.  Bizima Karaha threatened 
Ngezayo and others with hanging.  Ngezayo said that Karaha 
told him: \"This is our territory.  Go conquer your own.\" 
Ngezayo told econoff he didn\'t want to get anyone killed, so 
he suspended his party. 
 
 
8. (C) Ngezayo gave econoff a copy of the report on his 
workshop prepared for the RCD\'s intelligence service.  The 
memo\'s description of the workshop is remarkably similar to 
Ngezayo\'s.  The memo says the ostensible purpose of the 
workshop was to analyze the current crisis, but the real goal 
was to start a political party \"to install democracy and the 
rule of law in the Congo.\"  The author of the memo, Director 
General of Internal Security Christian Bya-Mweze, warns that 
the MPC could lead some leaders astray and calls for a 
forceful RCD response. 
 
 
-------------- 
Security Notes 
-------------- 
 
 
9. (C) While life in Goma is relatively secure, there are 
constant reminders that the situation is dramatically 
different in the rest of North Kivu.  The owner of a 
transportation company was interrupted during lunch by a 
phone call reporting delays due to the ambush of a truck just 
seven kilometers outside town on the road past the airport. 
A coffee buyer from Beni on a visit to Goma mentioned that a 
few nights earlier two people were killed in central Beni. 
He then commented that whenever a couple of UPDF are killed, 
the Ugandans burn villages and kill forty Congolese.  The 
Vice President of the local Chamber of Commerce (FEC) 
mentioned in a similarly offhand manner that he had been 
forced to assume double duties when the local FEC President 
was killed in a road ambush. 
 
 
10. (C) Residents of Goma describe a much more complicated 
security picture than is recognized in Kinshasa.  When 
attacks occur by irregular combatants, the perpetrators could 
be members of any of a number of groups: Mai Mai, Mongol, 
Simba, FDD, SPLA, LRA, Ex-FAR, Interhamwe, deserters or 
bandits.  Fixing blame is difficult.  (It is notable that 
those in Goma view the ex-FAR and Interhamwe as two separate 
groups, never linking them casually as is common in 
Kinshasa.)  Asked about reports that the Rwandans have 
created a force of false Interhamwe (Ref D), residents of 
Goma have an open mind.  They don\'t rule out the possibility 
that there is a Rwandan campaign to terrorize local 
residents, but note that these reports may simply refer to 
Rwandan expeditionary forces made up of recently released 
prisoners.  Anything is possible.  The great fear of Goma 
residents is that the Kivu provinces, once referred to as 
\"Little Switzerland,\" will become a land made up of warlords\' 
fiefdoms.

the delegation, Buse said. 
 
 
2. (SBU) The Ambassador said that he would report Buse\'s 
conversation to Washington and share with him any response. 
The Ambassador reminded Director Buse that the transition had 
only recently begun and the inauguration was still some three 
weeks away.  He pointed out the added complexity of arranging 
meetings in a transition between administrations.  He also 
urged Buse to seek the assistance of the Congolese Ambassador 
in Washington with regard to the delegation\'s visit. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Morning of December 27, the Ambassador met with 
Foreign Minister Okitundu to inform him, inter alia, of 
Buse\'s phone call.  Okitundu gave the impression that this 
was the first time he had heard of this particular 
delegation; he did say, however, that there had been 
considerable discussion in Presidential circles about an 
early visit to make their case on the Congo war to the new US 
administration, probably after the Presidential inauguration. 
 Okitundu volunteered that he would himself speak to Director 
Buse and Minister Mwenze today about the delegation and the 
timing for the visit.  He would thereafter be in further 
touch with the Ambassador.

1. (C)  IN A DECEMBER 27 MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER SHE 
OKITUNDU (SEPTEL), AMBASSADOR SWING REQUESTED INFORMATION ON 
THREE POLITICAL PRISONERS, AS WELL AS \"COMMANDANT\" ANSELME 
MASASU. THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT THEIR RELEASE AS A NEW

2. (C) AMBASSADOR SWING MET WITH FOREIGN MINISTER LEONARD SHE 
OKITUNDU DECEMBER 27 TO  DISCUSS THE LATTER\'S RECENT VISIT TO 
NEW YORK IN SUPPORT OF UN RESOLUTION 1332. OKITUNDU SAID HE 
WAS PLEASED WITH THE DOCUMENT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SPECIFIC 
MENTION OF TOWNS WHERE MONUC FORCES SHOULD DEPLOY, I.E. 
KISANGANI AND MBANDAKA, AND POSSIBLY GOMA AND BUKAVU. AS A 
RESULT OF THIS, HE SAID RESOLUTION 1332 REINFORCES THE 
CONCEPT OF AN INDIVISIBLE CONGO SINCE IT SPREADS MONUC FORCES 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY (AS OPPOSED TO STATIONING UN TROOPS 
ALONG THE FRONT SEPARATING THE WARRING FACTIONS). 
 
 
3. (C) THE FOREIGN MINISTER WAS PLEASED AT THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL\'S INVITATION IN UNSCR 1332 FOR THE SECRETARY GENERAL 
TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVENING A MEETING IN FEBRUARY 
BETWEEN THE LUSAKA SIGNATORIES AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL. AS A 
VENUE HE PREFERRED NEW YORK RATHER THAN ADDIS ABABA, AS NEW 
YORK REPRESENTED A MORE NEUTRAL SETTING. IN THE MEANTIME, HE 
SAID ALL SIDES SHOULD RESPECT THE DISENGAGEMENT PLAN AND 
HONOR THE LATEST CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT.

TALK OF WAR

4. (C) AMBASSADOR SWING ASKED HOW OKITUNDU RECONCILED HIS 
GOVERNMENT\'S RECENT SIGNATURE OF DISENGAGEMENT SUB-PLANS WITH 
REPORTS THAT KABILA AND HIS ALLIES HAD BOMBARDED GBADOLITE 
AND GEMENA ON DECEMBER 25. OKITUNDU REPLIED THAT GDRC WAS 
UNDER ATTACK ON TWO FRONTS, WITH ONE ASSAULT APPARENTLY 
TARGETING LUBUMBASHI. THESE ATTACKS ARE IN THEMSELVES 
VIOLATIONS AND MUST BE MET BY FORCE. \"IF WE DO NOT FIGHT 
BACK, LUBUMBASHI WILL FALL.\" 
 
 
5. (C) PROMPTED BY AMBASSADOR SWING, OKITUNDU SAID PRESIDENT 
KABILA\'S DECEMBER 22 MEETING WITH ZIMBABWE\'S ROBERT MUGABE 
AND NAMIBIA\'S SAM NUJOMA IN KINSHASA, AND HIS SUBSEQUENT 
BRIEFING OF DOS SANTOS IN LUANDA ON THE KINSHASA MEETING, 
WERE IN FACT COUNSELS OF WAR IN RESPONSE TO RWANDAN AND 
UGANDAN ATTACKS IN THE CONGO. WHILE HE DID NOT DIVULGE THE 
DETAILS OF THE MEETINGS, THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT IF 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FAILED TO STOP THE CURRENT 
OFFENSIVES \"THEN WE MUST BE PREPARED TO USE OTHER MEANS.\" 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
BONGO TO TAKE CHARGE OF LIBREVILLE II 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
6. (C) PRESIDENT KABILA\'S ATTEMPT TO MEET WITH OPPOSITION 
GROUPS IN LIBREVILLE DECEMBER 21 FAILED IN PART BECAUSE 
MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY. ACCORDING 
TO OKITUNDU, MAJOR OPPOSITION FIGURES REFUSED TO BOARD AN 
AIRCRAFT CHARTERED BY PRESIDENT KABILA OUT OF FEAR THE PLANE 
WAS IN FACT A TRAP SET TO BAG THE LOT OF THEM, AND SEND THEM 
TO DETENTION CENTERS IN LUBUMBASHI. MANY ALSO FEARED THAT 
KABILA WOULD SO DOMINATE THE LIBREVILLE AGENDA (AS HE HAS 
ATTEMPTED TO DO IN EVERY POLITICAL FORUM TO DATE) THAT IT WAS 
POINTLESS TO ATTEND. 
 
 
7. (C) YET THE WILL TO MEET WITH KABILA IS THERE, INSISTED 
OKITUNDU. HE CLAIMED THAT OPPOSITION GROUPS ROUTINELY CALL 
THE PRESIDENT TO ASK FOR APPOINTMENTS, AND THAT BOTH THE 
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPPOSITION ORIGINALLY APPROVED OF THE 
LIBREVILLE MEETING. 
 
 
8. (C) IN ORDER TO DISPEL OPPOSITION FEARS, OKITUNDU SAID THE 
GDRC IS ASKING PRESIDENT BONGO TO TAKE COMPLETE CHARGE OF 
LIBREVILLE II, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR THE END OF JANUARY. THE 
FOREIGN MINISTER DID NOT ELABORATE ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE 
GOB\'S COMING RESPONSIBILITIES. HOWEVER, THEY ARE LIKELY TO 
INCLUDE THE FORUM\'S AGENDA AS WELL AS LOGISTICAL SUPPORT IN 
ARRANGING FOR THE TRANSPORTATION, LODGING, AND FEEDING OF 
WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE SEVERAL HUNDRED CONGOLESE PARTICIPANTS. 
 
 
9. (C) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH HIS \"PACKAGING\" OF KABILA\'S POLICIES 
IS MORE ATTRACTIVE, AND HIS PRESENTATION OF THE ISSUES FAR 
LESS EMOTIONAL THAN HIS PREDECESSOR\'S, IT IS ALSO APPARENT 
THAT OKITUNDU\'S MARGIN OF MANEUVER IS EXTREMELY NARROW -- IN 
CONTRAST TO THAT OF HIS EARLIER HUMAN RIGHTS PORTFOLIO -- AS 
THIS LATEST CONVERSATION APTLY ILLUSTRATES.

SUBJECT: MONUC FORCE COMMANDER ON CURRENT SITUATION 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 
(C) (D) 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY 
     On December 28, Ambassador Swing met with MONUC Force 
Commander Mountaga Diallo, acting in absence of SRSG Kamel 
Morjane, and SRSG Chief of Staff Sow, to review developments 
in the Congo war in general and his visit to Zambia from 
which he had just returned the evening before. Diallo is 
appealing to New York to assist Zambia handle the large 
numbers of Congolese soldiers and civilians who have fled to 
northern Zambia in the wake of Pweto\'s fall to Rwandan and 
RCD forces.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (C) FAC Soldiers in Zambia 
     General Diallo confirmed that there are 3374 \"declared\" 
FAC (Congolese government) soldiers presently at two 
locations in Zambia after fleeing the Rwandan RCD attack on 
Pweto.  Although all are \"declared\" as FAC, there are 
undoubtedly some Interahamwe, ex-FAR and Burundian FDD 
elements among them, but their numbers are not presently 
known. 
     The immediate issue facing Zambian authorities is how to 
lodge and feed the FAC soldiers.  To support them is quite 
costly, Diallo said.  In addition, the soldiers are being 
accommodated in school buildings, and schools in Zambia are 
scheduled to begin in a few days.  The ICRC is reviewing this 
situation to determine its ability to assist but has not yet 
responded officially.  There are also, reportedly, large 
numbers of other FAC soldiers possibly taking refuge in the 
extreme northwestern corner of Zambia on Lake Tanganyika, but 
no one has seen them as yet. 
     In addition to the FAC soldiers, there are an additional 
34,000 Congolese civilians registered in two camps near the 
DRC border in northern Zambia, and many others not 
registered--all of whom arrived in the days following the 
fall of Pweto at the beginning of the month. 
 
 
3. (C) SADC Force Concern Re Zambia/Rwanda Talks 
     SADC Force Commander Chingombwe (Zimbabwe) had expressed 
concern to him earlier in the day, Diallo said, about 
discussions taking place between Zambia and Rwanda. 
Chingombwe claimed that these concerned a desire by Rwanda to 
use Zambian territory from which to launch an attack on 
Lubumbashi. (Diallo discounted this allegation, saying that 
he had just spoken with a senior Zambian official (Silambwa) 
who told him that the discussions related to Rwanda\'s concern 
about the FDD\'s having been able to cross back into the DRC 
after having fled to Zambia.)  Nonetheless, Diallo said that 
Chingombwe may go public with an expression of concern about 
the talks. 
 
 
4. (C) An Appeal to Help Zambia 
     Diallo said \"Zambia needs help.\"  The UNHCR, he said, 
cannot help unless the FAC soldiers renounce their military 
status and accept refugee status.  To date, only some 200 had 
been willing to do so. 
     Zambia needs international support to keep the FAC 
soldiers in Zambia.  Diallo expressed concern that Rwanda 
would cause problems should the FAC (and negative force 
elements) be allowed to return to the DRC. 
     General Diallo viewed positively Kabila\'s request to see 
Zambian President Chiluba (according to word Diallo had from 
his talk with Silambwa).  The meeting would likely take place 
at Lubumbashi or Lusaka. 
 
 
5. (C) Sub-Plans and National Dialogue 
     The MLC continues to insist that it will not sign the 
disengagement sub-plans unless the issue of the national 
dialogue is effectively addressed.  Diallo said that MLC 
leader Bemba is not opposed to co-facilitation by Masire and 
Gabonese president Bongo. 
     The RCD now appears to be backtracking on its commitment 
to the disengagement sub-plans, saying that its earlier 
signing is suspended until (a) there is renewed commitment to 
the national dialogue; (b) MONUC deploys; and (c) disarmament 
of the \"negative forces\" has begun. 
     In these regards, Diallo was somewhat pessimistic that 
the earlier postponed Kampala meeting of belligerent chiefs 
of staff would in fact take place on the new date of January 
10. 
 
 
6. (C) Urgent JPC Requested 
     Force Commander Diallo has asked the Zambians to urge 
the chairman to convene an urgent meeting of the Joint 
Political Commission (JPC).  Given the upcoming New Year\'s 
holiday, this meeting might not be possible until the second 
week of January. 
 
 
7. (C) UN Deployment Technical Team 
     Asked about the status of the UN technical assessment 
mission due to arrive January 3 as a precursor to MONUC 
deployment, General Diallo said he feared that New York may 
be having second thoughts about sending the team just now in 
the light of military developments in Katanga and Equateur. 
     Diallo is urging the UN to send the team, on the date 
scheduled, arguing that positive efforts are being made to 
move the Lusaka process forward (the January 10 Kampala 
meeting of Chiefs of Staff; the proposed JPC meetings; and 
Libreville II in the second half of January).

1. (C) Summary: On December 28 Finance Minister Amisi told 
the Ambassador that he hopes to have Presidential approval 
for both an interim economic reform program and a new budget 
by mid-January.  He said his program would include market 
liberalization, deficit reduction and policies to encourage 
local food production.  He said the IFIs have agreed to 
review GDRC performance after three months.  The Ambassador 
gave Amisi information on requirements for USG debt 
forgiveness, including military transparency.  Amisi appears 
more committed than his predecessor to doing the right thing, 
but his ability to put his plans into practice is 
questionable.  End summary. 
 
 
------------------- 
Critical Time Ahead 
------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) During a visit from the Ambassador on December 28, 
Minister of Finance Jean Amisi Kalondaya said he had two key 
programs he would present to the President for approval by 
mid-January.  One is a draft budget, which he expects to 
complete within two weeks.  The other is an interim economic 
reform program.  Amisi said that he expects a World Bank/IMF 
team to visit Kinshasa around January 15, and implied that he 
hopes to have government approval for the reform program 
before they arrive.  (At their meeting on December 29 
(septel), recalling his talk with Amisi the previous day, 
Ambassador Swing encouraged President Kabila to give full 
support to the World Bank/IMF mission when it comes here in 
January.) 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
Pleased with International Support 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
3. (C) Amisi told the Ambassador he recently spoke by phone 
with World Bank President Wolfensohn and IMF Managing 
Director Kohler, and he said that both expressed support. 
Amisi said the IFIs had agreed to review the DRC\'s 
performance three months after his reform program is 
implemented and to consider a negotiated program at that 
time.  He acknowledged that past recommendations from Bank 
and Fund experts had not been followed, but noted that 
despite this the World Bank is moving ahead to activate the 
Emergency Stabilization Fund.  Amisi told the Ambassador that 
he hoped to use most of the $5 million in the Stabilization 
Fund for road-building projects.  He also expressed 
satisfaction with the African Development Bank\'s plan to 
begin a major capacity building project for the GDRC. 
Finally, he said the European Community will release 200 
million euro in credits for the DRC as soon as the GDRC pays 
a $500 thousand membership fee, something he hopes to achieve 
in the next week. 
 
 
------------------ 
The Reform Program 
------------------ 
 
 
4. (C) Amisi gave only a broad overview of his reform 
program.  He said he plans to liberalize diamond, petroleum 
and foreign exchange markets, but noted that foreign exchange 
liberalization will need to be staged.  He admitted that 
current policy includes a large subsidy for fuels that the 
government can ill afford.  He told the Ambassador he is 
confident that he can increase government revenues 
dramatically and thereby reduce the budget deficit, which 
will allow the GDRC to reduce money supply growth and control 
inflation. 
 
 
5. (C) Amisi was enthusiastic about plans to reduce the 
demand for hard currency by increasing local production and 
limiting imports.  He told the Ambassador that restrictions 
on the DRC\'s imports of salted fish will quickly lead to a 
resurgent fishing industry.  Similarly, he said, local 
production of pork, chicken, corn and manioc must be 
encouraged. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
The Importance of Getting It Right 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador told Amisi that he was wise to make 
relations with the IFIs one of his top priorities, since 
their participation will help the DRC design the right 
program, will open the way to multilateral financing, and is 
a prerequisite for bilateral debt relief.  He gave the 
Minister information on the HIPC program and noted that the 
USG is committed to providing debt relief to countries 
meeting requirements.  He also described for Amisi U.S. 
legislation relating to military budget transparency and left 
him a copy of the demarche delivered to former-Minister 
Mawampanga in March (Reftel).  The Ambassador recommended 
that the GDRC focus efforts on reform of the parastatal 
sector as well.  He explained USG restrictions on assistance 
to the GDRC to Amisi, but noted that we still had the 
opportunity to be helpful in promoting reform, such as when 
we sponsored the Public-Private Partnership Forum in October. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
7. (C) It was a refreshing change to discuss economic issues 
with the Finance Minister, instead of listening to an 
emotional diatribe about the war.  Amisi said all the right 
things about market liberalization, and about fiscal and 
monetary restraint.  However, his belief that food imports 
can quickly be replaced appears naive, and his estimate of 
the amount and speed of international support the GDRC can 
expect appears overly optimistic.  More importantly, his 
success will hinge on his ability to secure the support of 
President Kabila in the face of opposition from some of those 
closest to the President.  Nothing we know about him or saw 
during our call inspires confidence that he will be able to 
deliver where others have failed.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT KABILA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 
(C) (D) 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  Ambassador Swing met with President Kabila 
for an hour at latter\'s Marble Palace Office on December 29. 
In response to concerns expressed about the renewed fighting 
in Katanga and Equateur Provinces, Kabila defended his 
actions as defensive moves in retaliation for Rwandan 
offensives in Katanga and Bemba\'s MLC in Equateur.  A senior 
DRC delegation is presently holding meetings with President 
Chiluba in Lusaka regarding Kabila\'s allegation that Zambia 
may be allowing Rwanda to use its territory to attack 
Lubumbashi.  Kabila said that he looks forward to meeting 
with Congressman Frank Wolf on January 8.  Ambassador urged 
Kabila to appoint a new UN permanent representative without 
further delay.  Septel reports on Kabila\'s discussions with 
Burundian President Buyoya.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (C) Good News.....bad news at year\'s end 
     Ambassador Swing and President Kabila met alone for an 
hour at latter\'s Marble Palace office and home in the Binza 
section of town.  Although showing signs of fatigue, Kabila 
was relaxed and in a good mood. (His unofficial number two 
and relative, Interior Minister of State Gaetan Kakudji, 
waited outside the house during the meeting.)  The Ambassador 
hailed the passage of UNSCR 1332 and the signature of 
disengagement sub-plans, but expressed concern at the renewed 
fighting in Katanga and Equateur and the difficult situation 
this was creating both inside the DRC and in neighboring 
Zambia. 
 
 
3. (C) \"End of the war perceptible if......\" 
     The Ambassador asked whether, notwithstanding these 
latest conflicts, it is conceivable that the end of the Congo 
war might be approaching with the prolongation of MONUC\'s 
mandate and the signature of the disengagement sub-plans. 
Kabila replied affirmatively, saying that the end of the war 
is \"perceptible\" provided the disengagement sub-plans are 
effectively implemented and MONUC deploys. 
     \"Unfortunately\", Kabila said, Rwanda has chosen to 
\"re-start\" the fighting which he found \"surprising\".  Also, 
JP Bemba and his MLC had decided to take the war further 
south and to capture Befale.  These moves had forced him, 
Kabila, to re-position and activate FAC \"aviation\".  He had 
also had to reinforce Boende, including moving heavy 
equipment there.  \"Bemba must leave Befale\", he said. 
 
 
4. (C) Talks with Chiluba about Rwanda 
     The Ambassador also expressed concerns about the serious 
situation which the Katanga fighting is creating inside 
northern Zambia (Kinshasa 8622).  Kabila turned the issue 
around to allege Zambian collaboration with Rwanda and the 
RPA.  He claimed that President Chiluba had authorized Rwanda 
to let an RPA brigade transit Zambia to attack Lubumbashi via 
Kipushi.  The source of his information, Kabila said, is 
senior Zambian military leadership, some of whom have ethnic, 
familial and linguistic links in Katanga. 
     As a result of his concern, Kabila said, he had taken 
two measures.  He had phoned Chiluba personally to express 
his \"discontent\" and to demand that Chiluba cease any further 
collaboration with Rwanda and the RPA.  Second, he had sent 
General Joseph Kabila and Katanga Governor Augustin Katumba 
Mwanke to Lusaka this week to follow up with President 
Chiluba.  During the three days they had been in Lusaka, they 
had already seen Chiluba twice, he said.  He had instructed 
Joseph Kabila to stay longer if necessary to \"coordinate\" on 
the issue with the Zambians.  (Kabila claimed that because 
Chibula\'s \"security chief\" has close ties with Rwanda, he 
often gets Chiluba into difficulty, such as in this case.) 
 
 
5. (C) CODEL Wolf 
     The Ambassador informed Kabila that Congressman Frank 
Wolf would be visiting the Congo (DRC) January 7-10 and urged 
Kabila to meet with him and his delegation, noting that they 
would also be traveling to Goma and Bukavu.  Kabila said that 
he expected   at present to be in Kinshasa on January 8 and 
would be pleased to see the Congressman that morning. 
 
 
6. (C) A New Congolese Ambassador to UN Urgently Needed 
     Kabila agreed with the Ambassador both that Andre 
Kapanga has represented Kabila and the DRC well as Ambassador 
to the UN, and that it would not be in the Congo\'s interest 
to leave this key post vacant very long.  Kabila said that, 
precisely because it is critical to find someone of Kapanga\'s 
quality, it had taken longer than desired to name a 
replacement.  He hoped, however, to be able to announce the 
name of the new Ambassador soon.

1. MONUC HAS AGREED TO PUT A UN AIRCRAFT AT THE DISPOSAL OF 
CODEL WOLF BEGINNING JANUARY 8 IN KINSHASA. ACCORDING TO THE 
CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER OF MONUC, A TWIN-ENGINE AIRCRAFT 
WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE CODEL FOR THE TIME THEY ARE IN 
THE CONGO (DRC). SPECIFICALLY, THE AIRCRAFT WILL TAKE THE 
CONGRESSMAN WOLF AND HIS DELEGATION FROM KINSHASA TO GOMA, 
AND ON TO BUKAVU BEFORE RETURNING TO GOMA. 
 
 
2. EMBASSIES KINSHASA AND KIGALI WOULD THEN COORDINATE TO 
ARRANGE FOR CODEL\'S WOLF\'S TRANSPORTATION TO THE NEARBY 
RWANDAN TOWN OF GISENYI FOR ONWARD TRAVEL TO KIGALI, 
 
 
3. THE MONUC ADMINISTRATOR SAID THAT DUE TO LOGISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS, IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR MONUC TO 
PROVIDE AN AIRCRAFT SPECIFICALLY FOR CODEL WOLF STARTING FROM 
GOMA. HE THEREFORE SUGGESTED THE KINSHASA VENUE AS THE MOST 
FEASIBLE. 
 
 
4. IN ADDITION, IN A DECEMBER 29 MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR 
SWING, PRESIDENT KABILA AGREED TO THE AMBASSADOR\'S REQUEST TO 
MEET WITH CONGRESSMAN WOLF AND HIS PARTY ON MONDAY, JANUARY 8 
IN KINSHASA WHERE HE EXPECTS TO BE, AT THIS TIME.

SUBJECT: GDRC CLAIMS KABILA ALIVE 
 
CLASSIFIED BY CDA BARRIE WALKLEY FOR REASONS 1.5(B)(D) 
 
1. (U) THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS WAS SUMMONED TO THE OAU VILLAGE 
EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 17. PRESIDENTIAL CHEF DE 
CABINET GEORGES BUSE PRESIDED OVER THE MEETING AND READ A 
SHORT COMMUNIQUE; HE WAS FLANKED BY GENERAL EDDY KAPEND AND 
KABILA ADVISOR AND COUNSEL JEAN MBUYU. 
 
2. (U) BUSE SAID KABILA WAS WOUNDED IN THE JANUARY 16 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, GIVEN INITIAL MEDICAL TREATMENT IN 
KINSHASA AND THEN FLOWN \"OUT OF THE COUNTRY\" FOR ADDITIONAL 
MEDICAL TREATMENT, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DOCTOR AND THE MINISTER 
OF HEALTH. (NOTE: BUSE DID NOT IDENTIFY THE DESTINATION, BUT 
EVERYONE ASSUMES IT TO HAVE BEEN HARARE.) 
 
3. (U) THE GDRC HAD THIS MORNING DECIDED IN AN EXTRAORDINARY 
SESSION OF MINISTERS, BUSE SAID, THAT UNTIL KABILA IS ABLE TO 
RETURN, HIS SON -- GENERAL JOSEPH KABILA -- WOULD ACT AS 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
4. (U) BUSE SAID THE GDRC URGED CALM AND A RETURN TO 
NORMALCY.  THE GDRC CONSEQUENTLY HAD TAKEN TWO DECISIONS: THE 
AIRPORTS WILL BE REOPENED AND THE CURFEW RELAXED (NEW CURFEW 
HOURS ARE TO BE 2200-0500). 
 
5. (U) BUSE CONCLUDED HIS REMARKS BY SAYING THE GDRC WISHES 
KABILA A PROMPT RECOVERY. 
 
6. (U) AT THE END OF THE MEETING, THE DIPS WERE LINED UP AND 
IN WALKED JOSEPH KABILA TO SHAKE EVERYONE\'S HAND.  CHARGE 
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT HIS HAND ON KABILA\'S 
SHOULDER; HE DID NOT APPEAR INJURED IN ANY WAY (CONTRARY TO 
SOME RUMORS THAT HE HAD BEEN SHOT). 
 
7. (S) WHEN CHARGE WAS WALKING OUT, HE WAS APPROACHED 
SEPARATELY BY JEAN MBUYU AND VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
ILUNGA AWAN.  BOTH DISCREETLY SAID THAT JOSEPH KABILA SEEKS A 
PRIVATE MEETING WITH CHARGE THIS AFTERNOON OR EVENING (TIME 
NOT YET IDENTIFIED) AND ASKED THAT THIS BE KEPT IN 
CONFIDENCE. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT: IT IS DIFFICULT AT THE MOMENT TO DETERMINE 
THE TRUTH.  IS KABILA ALIVE, OR IS THIS SIMPLY A CYNICAL GDRC 
LINE DESIGNED TO EARN ADDITIONAL TIME FOR MANEUVER? 
 
9. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: WHATEVER THE TRUTH ABOUT KABILA\'S 
CONDITION, THE CHOICE OF JOSEPH KABILA AS INTERIM HEAD OF 
GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE AN ASTUTE MOVE.  NO DOUBT THOSE 
BEHIND THE SCENE SEE HIM AS A MALLEABLE FIGUREHEAD WHO IS 
PRESENTABLE TO THE PEOPLE (AND WHO, FOR THE TIME BEING AT 
LEAST, MAKES POSSIBLE A PUBLIC PAPERING-OVER OF THE SERIOUS 
MILITARY AND POLITICAL SPLITS IN THE GDRC).

MWENZE KONGOLO (MINISTER OF JUSTICE), HENRI MOVA (MINISTER OF

HE WISHED TO INFORM THE US, BELGIUM AND FRANCE OF THE CURRENT 
STATE OF EVENTS AND TO REQUEST THE \"UNDERSTANDING AND 
ASSISTANCE\" OF THE DRC\'S \"CLOSE FRIENDS\" AS THE COUNTRY GOES 
THROUGH A DIFFICULT PERIOD.

APPEARS KABILA WAS PROBABLY SITTING DOWN AT THE TIME). KABILA 
WAS TAKEN IN A COMA TO HARARE, WHERE--ACCORDING TO MWENZE--HE 
DIED WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  (NOTE: THIS ACCOUNT, IF THE GOVERNMENT 
STICKS TO IT, WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CLAIM THEY WERE TELLING THE

WAS ALIVE.)  THE ASSAILANT, MWENZE SAID, WAS KILLED. 
 
3. (C) THE BODY, MWENZE ADDED, IS STILL IN HARARE AND 
ARRANGEMENTS ARE BEING MADE FOR ITS RETURN.  A COMMITTEE OF

WERE STILL BEING MADE. 
 
4. (C) MWENZE INDICATED THAT AN OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE 
MADE TODAY REGARDING THE DEATH AND HE CONFIRMED THAT JOSEPH 
KABILA WILL ADDRESS THE NATION TONIGHT (NOT A POLITICAL 
SPEECH, ACCORDING TO MWENZE, BUT A GENERAL SPEECH ABOUT 
CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRY, INTENDED TO MAINTAIN CALM). 
 
5. (C) MWENZE SAID THE GDRC DID NOT DEFINITIVELY KNOW WHO WAS 
BEHIND KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION BUT ADDED THAT \"WE ARE ON THE 
TRAIL.\"  ASKED ABOUT REPORTS OF AN IMMINENT CABINET 
RESHUFFLE, HE SAID THAT IT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION BUT HE WASN\'T 
FREE TO TALK ABOUT IT. 
 
6. (C) CHARGE HAS BEEN CONVOKED FOR A MEETING THIS AFTERNOON

1. (C) CHARGE WAS CONVOKED FOR A MEETING WITH INTERIM HEAD OF 
GOVERNMENT GENERAL JOSEPH KABILA AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 18. 
THIS WAS NOT EXACTLY THE \"KEEP IT IN CONFIDENCE\" MEETING THAT 
CHARGE HAD BEEN TOLD JOSEPH KABILA SOUGHT (REFTEL). 
AMBASSADORS FROM THE OTHER UNSC PERMREP COUNTRIES (UK, 
FRANCE, RUSSIA, CHINA) PLUS BELGIUM HAD ALSO BEEN INVITED FOR 
A MEETING AT THE SAME TIME; WE WERE SEEN SEQUENTIALLY BUT 
SEPARATELY, WHICH MEANT A LONG WAIT FOR SOME. 
 
2. (C) JOSEPH KABILA WAS NOT IN UNIFORM (HE WAS WEARING A 
SAFARI SUIT) AND SPOKE IN ENGLISH (WHICH IS EXCELLENT: 
VIRTUALLY UNACCENTED NATIVE FLUENCY).  THE ONLY OTHER PERSON 
IN THE ROOM WAS PRESIDENTIAL CHEF DE CABINET GEORGES BUSE. 
KABILA SAID THAT IN THIS TIME OF TRIAL HE SEEKS US MORAL 
SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT AND FOR THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE. HE 
SAID THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO MOVE FORWARD TO GENUINE 
DEMOCRACY, NOT SIMPLY TO REMAIN IN POWER. HE STRESSED THAT HE 
RECOGNIZES THAT POWER COMES FROM THE PEOPLE, THROUGH HONEST 
AND FAIR ELECTIONS. HOWEVER, HE ADDED, THERE CAN\'T BE 
DEMOCRACY WITHOUT PEACE--WHICH IN TURN IS DEPENDENT UPON \"THE 
DEPARTURE OF THE AGGRESSORS.\" 
 
3. (C) PRESIDENT KABILA DIED FOR PEACE, HE SAID, AND HE 
(JOSEPH) HIMSELF IS TRYING TO PICK UP THE PIECES.  THE US, AS 
THE WORLD\'S SUPERPOWER, HAS AN OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT THE 
PEACE INITIATIVES, PARTICULARLY THE RELEVANT UNSC RESOLUTIONS 
AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF MONUC.  HE ADDED THAT HE WOULD BE 
SEEING SRSG KAMEL MORJANE JANUARY 19 TO INSIST THAT THE UN 
UNDERTAKE ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AND BEGIN MONUC DEPLOYMENT 
\"SINCE WE HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO THE CONDITIONS FOR 
DEPLOYMENT.\" 
 
4 (C) WHETHER THE WORLD BELIEVES IT OR NOT, KABILA SAID, THE 
GDRC SEEKS DEMOCRACY--\"JUST LIKE SOUTH AFRICA AND NIGERIA.\" 
\"WE WANT OPENNESS,\" HE SAID, WE WANT FREEDOM OF 
DISCUSSION\"--BUT NOT AT THE PRICE OF A DIVIDED COUNTRY.  THE 
CONGO\'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, HE SAID, CANNOT BE 
COMPROMISED.  WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR AT THE MOMENT, HE 
CONCLUDED, IS A PERIOD OF STABILITY AND CALM THAT WILL ALLOW 
US TO PURSUE PEACE INITIATIVES. 
 
5.  (C) COMMENT: THERE WAS NOTHING STRIKINGLY NEW IN JOSEPH 
KABLA\'S COMMENTS; THEY COULD JUST AS READILY HAVE BEEN MADE 
BY HIS FATHER, LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA.  HOWEVER, HE GAVE EVERY 
IMPRESSION OF WISHING TO GET OFF ON A NEW FOOTING WITH THE 
US.  HE PRESENTED HIS POINTS WELL AND CONVINCINGLY--DESPITE 
HIS RELATVELY YOUNG AGE (HE IS APPROXIMATELY 30 YEARS OLD) 
AND INEXPERIENCED IN THIS SORT OF ROLE.

SUBJECT: KABILA LAID TO REST 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 
1.5(B)(D) 
 
---------------- 
1. (C) SUMMARY 
--------------- 
 
IN A DIGNIFIED, WELL ORGANIZED SIX-HOUR CEREMONY, PRESIDENT 
LAURENT KABILA WAS BURIED JANUARY 23 IN THE PRESENCE OF SIX 
AFRICAN PRESIDENTS, AND NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER HIGH-LEVEL 
FOREIGN DELEGATIONS ALMOST ALL OF WHOM DEPARTED KINSHASA 
BEFORE NIGHTFALL.  SECURITY WAS TIGHT AROUND THE NEW 
PRESIDENT, JOSEPH KABILA, WITH ANGOLAN AND ZIMBABWEAN 
REINFORCEMENTS FORMING ITS BACKBONE, AND, WHILE THERE WERE 
TENSE MOMENTS AMONG THE HUGE CROWD LINING THE STREETS, THERE 
WERE NO MAJOR INCIDENTS.  OFFICIAL EULOGIES, OVERALL, WERE 
CONCILIATORY.  AFTER THE FUNERAL, THE GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY 
BEGAN PREPARATIONS FOR THE INAUGURATION OF JOSEPH KABILA.. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------ 
2. (C) STRONG FOREIGN PARTICIPATION 
----------------------------------- 
 
SIX AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE ATTENDED THE FUNERAL SERVICE AT 
THE PALAIS DU PEUPLE AND BURIAL AT A NEW MAUSOLEUM IN FRONT 
OF THE PALAIS DE LA NATION.  BESIDES THE DRC\'S THREE SADC 
ALLIES -- DOS SANTOS OF ANGOLA, MUGABE OF ZIMBABWE, AND 
NUJOMA OF NAMIBIA -- ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT CHILUBA, AND THE 
SUDANESE AND MALAWIAN HEADS OF STATE ALSO ATTENDED. 
 
OTHER DELEGATIONS INCLUDED:  FORMER NIGERIAN HEAD OF STATE 
ABUBAKAR; THE VICE PRESIDENTS OF SOUTH AFRICA AND KENYA; 
BELGIAN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER LOUIS MICHEL; AS WELL AS 
MINISTERIAL DELEGATIONS FROM GUINEA/CONAKRY; EQUATORIAL 
GUINEA; MOROCCO; TANZANIA; LIBYA; IRAN; CUBA; BENIN; CHAD; 
AND CONGO/BRAZZAVILLE; AND THE OAU DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL. 
 
---------------------- 
3. (S) SECURITY TIGHT 
---------------------- 
 
SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUNERAL AND BURIAL WERE TIGHT. 
ANGOLA FLEW IN SEVERAL HUNDRED REINFORCEMENTS, INCLUDING A 
NUMBER OF THEIR OWN POLICE VEHICLES, AND ZIMBABWE MADE 
IMPRESSIVE FIGHTER PLANE FLYOVERS DURING POIGNANT MOMENTS, 
INCLUDING AT THE TIME KABILA\'S BODY WAS PLACED IN A MARBLE 
MAUSOLEUM, HASTILY CONSTRUCTED IN THE DAYS SINCE HIS 
ASSASSINATION. 
 
AT A RUMP SESSION OF WESTERN AMBASSADORS FOLLOWING THE 
FUNERAL AND BURIAL, THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR ASSERTED THAT, WITH 
VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS, BOTH THE CONGO\'S RAPID INTERVENTION 
POLICE AND THE FAC MILITARY HAD BEEN DISARMED, PUTTING 
SECURITY AT PRESENT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OF THE 
ANGOLANS AND ZIMBABWEANS. 
 
EMOTIONS WERE RUNNING HIGH THROUGHOUT THE DAY, CAUSING US AS 
WELL AS THE FRENCH AND SEVERAL OTHER EMBASSIES TO PUT OUT AN 
\"ALL CALL\" RADIO MESSAGE TO WARDENS AND OTHER CITIZENS TO 
STAY OFF THE STREET FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.  SOME IN THE 
CROWDS THICKLY LINING THE STREETS YELLED INSULTS AT DIPLOMATS 
AS THEIR CARS PASSED, AND THERE WERE ISOLATED INSTANCES OF 
STONES BEING THROWN AT DIPLOMATIC VEHICLES, INCLUDING THAT OF 
BELGIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ON HIS WAY TO THE AIRPORT. 
 
THERE WERE NO SERIOUS INCIDENTS, HOWEVER, AND NO ONE OF WHOM 
WE ARE AWARE WAS INJURED.  IN GENERAL, SECURITY AUTHORITIES 
DID A COMMENDABLE JOB OF MAINTAINING ORDER, ESPECIALLY GIVEN 
THE RECORD NUMBER OF PERSONS ON THE STREET.  (IN CONTRAST TO 
THE FUNERAL AT THE \"PALAIS DU PEUPLE\", CROWDS WERE EXCLUDED 
FROM APPROACHING THE BURIAL SITE AT THE DOWNTOWN \"PALAIS DE 
LA NATION\".) 
 
---------------------------------- 
4. (S) EULOGIES TO A SLAIN LEADER 
---------------------------------- 
 
OVERALL, THE PUBLIC EULOGIES TO KABILA WERE CONCILIATORY AND 
FORWARD-LOOKING.  THE MAJOR EXCEPTION WAS THAT OF THE 
\"TRANSITIONAL PARLIAMENT\" (ACL-PT) REPRESENTATIVE WHICH 
LARGELY REHASHED THE STANDARD FARE CONCERNING RWANDAN/UGANDAN 
AGGRESSION.  MINISTER OF STATE KAKUDJI, WHILE BLAMING ALL OF 
THE CONGO\'S CURRENT PROBLEMS ON THE WAR, DID ENDORSE A 
DIALOGUE AMONG THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE \"ONCE ORDER HAS BEEN 
RESTORED.\"  THE WAR, HE SAID, HAD \"UNFORTUNATELY\" RUINED THE 
PROSPECTS FOR KABILA\'S PROGRAM OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
REFORMS.  HE RECEIVED LOUD APPLAUSE WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD SPARE NO EFFORT IN CONDUCTING A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION, BUT NO APPLAUSE ON EITHER 
OF THE TWO OCCASIONS WHEN BE REFERRED TO JOSEPH KABILA AS THE 
NEW PRESIDENT.  KAKUDJI CALLED ON MONUC TO DEPLOY AND FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THE UNSC RESOLUTIONS 
ARE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. 
 
THE CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP, CARDINAL ETSOU, MADE THE MOST 
THOUGHTFUL AND COURAGEOUS ELOCUTION OF THE DAY, CONDEMNING 
ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE IN PURSUIT OF, OR TO CONSERVE, POWER. 
HE URGED A SINCERE, FRANK DIALOGUE AMONG THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE 
\"WITHOUT EXCLUSION,\" IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A STATE OF LAW AND 
PROSPEROUS NATION, AND APPEALED TO ALL THE BELLIGERENTS TO 
END THE WAR. 
 
---------------- 
5. (S) COMMENT: 
---------------- 
 
WE, AND OUR DIPLOMATIC COLLEAGUES, CONTINUE TO BE IMPRESSED 
WITH THE SMOOTH, EFFICIENT MANNER IN WHICH THE INTERIM 
GOVERNMENT IS CONDUCTING THE AFFAIRS OF STATE, AT LEAST ON 
TECHNICAL MATTERS SUCH AS FUNERAL AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. 
THEY ARE NOW BUSILY PREPARING THE INAUGURATION OF JOSEPH 
KABILA AS HIS FATHER\'S SUCCESSOR.

1. (C) WITH THE INITIAL SHOCK OF KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION, AND 
NOW HIS BURIAL, BEHIND THEM, THE CONGOLESE POWER STRUCTURE IS 
STRUGGLING TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THEIR NEW SITUATION AND MOVE 
AHEAD. 
 
--------------------------- 
2. (C) KABILA\'S ADVISERS 
--------------------------- 
 
IN THIS CONNECTION, PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA HAS ASSEMBLED AS 
ADVISERS A SMALL GROUP OF MILITARY MEN AROUND HIM, INCLUDING: 
GENERAL KALUME, MINISTER OF PLANNING AND RECONSTRUCTION; FAC 
GENERAL OLENGO; AND COLONEL EDDY KAPEND, AIDE-DE-CAMP UNDER 
LAURENT KABILA.  ON THE CIVILIAN SIDE, HE HAS ALSO BEGUN TO 
ASSEMBLE ABLE TECHNOCRATS SUCH AS LAWYER JEAN MBUYU (WHOM WE 
REGARD HIGHLY AND WHO, WE UNDERSTAND, ALSO WROTE KAKUDJI\'S 
REMARKS AT THE FUNERAL). 
 
------------------------------------- 
3. (C) A PROMISING INAUGURAL ADDRESS 
------------------------------------- 
 
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THESE ADVISERS -- AND THAT OF SOME OF 
THE LEADERS HERE FOR THE FUNERAL, SUCH AS BELGIAN DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER LOUIS MICHEL -- JOSEPH KABILA IS PRESENTLY 
PREPARING HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, WHICH HE EXPECTS TO DELIVER 
BEFORE THE WEEKEND.  ONE OF OUR SOURCES, WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE 
SEEN AN INITIAL DRAFT OF KABILA\'S REMARKS, TOLD US THAT HE IS 
IMPRESSED.  EMPHASIS WILL BE ON OPENING UP THE PROCESS, BOTH 
WITH REGARD TO THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, LIBERALIZING DECREE 194 
WHICH IMPOSES HEAVY LIMITS ON POLITICAL PARTY ORGANIZATIONS 
AND ACTIVITIES; AND STRENGTHENING THE GOVERNMENT\'S HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD.  THE INAUGURAL ADDRESS WILL ALSO MAKE AN 
URGENT APPEAL FOR A REVIVAL OF THE PEACE EFFORT BASED ON 
LUSAKA, AT LEAST AS A REFERENCE POINT, AND MAKE A 
CONCILIATORY GESTURE, UNDEFINED, TOWARD NATIONAL DIALOGUE 
FACILITATOR MASIRE.  WE UNDERSTAND, FURTHER, THAT THE 
POSTPONEMENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION FROM JANUARY 24 
TO JANUARY 25 OR 26 WAS DUE TO LAST DITCH EFFORTS BY 
HARD-LINERS, NOTABLY JUSTICE MINISTER MWENZE KONGOLO AND 
OTHERS, TO WATER DOWN KABILA\'S CONSTRUCTIVE, FORWARD-LOOKING 
MESSAGE (RATHER THAN TECHNICAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL REASONS). 
 
------------------------------ 
4. (C) WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT? 
------------------------------ 
 
THE MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IN MOVING AHEAD IS THAT OF THE 
NATURE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE KABILA IS TO ASSUME, AND 
THREE MODELS ARE BEING DISCUSSED: 
 
-- BE SWORN IN NOW AS A \"FULL\" PRESIDENT WITH AN OPEN-ENDED 
TERM AND DEAL WITH OTHER ISSUES OR PROBLEMS THIS MAY POSE 
LATER; 
 
-- AGREE TO BE A TRANSITIONAL \"INTERIM\" PRESIDENT; OR, 
 
-- BECOME A \"FULL\" PRESIDENT WITH A STRICTLY LIMITED TERM OF 
OFFICE, THAT IS, ELECTIONS TO BE HELD WITHIN TWO YEARS. 
 
JOSEPH KABILA AND HIS ADVISERS APPARENTLY PREFER THE LAST 
OPTION, AND WE AND MOST OTHER DIPLOMATS HERE CONSIDER IT THE 
LEAST PROBLEMATICAL AND MOST LIKELY TO PROMOTE RECONCILIATION 
AND STABILITY IN THE INTERIM. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
5. (C) THE QUESTION OF LEGITIMACY 
---------------------------------- 
 
BELGIAN AMBASSADOR NIJSKENS TOLD AMBASSADOR SWING EVENING OF 
JANUARY 24 THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD RESEARCHED THE QUESTION OF 
SUCCESSION AND HAD CONCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: 
 
-- DECREE NUMBER THREE OF MAY 1997 (ISSUED JUST DAYS AFTER 
KABILA TOOK POWER) IS SILENT ON THE QUESTION OF PRESIDENTIAL 
SUCCESSION. 
 
-- HOWEVER, THE DECREE DOES PROVIDE THAT, ANY ISSUE WHICH 
DECREE 3 DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS IS TO BE COVERED BY 
THE \"TRANSITIONAL ACT\"; AND, 
 
-- ARTICLE 54 OF THE \"ACTE DE TRANSITION\" PROVIDES THAT WHEN 
THE PARLIAMENT DETERMINES THAT THE PRESIDENCY IS \"VACANT\", 
THE PARLIAMENT AND SUPREME COURT DECIDE IN WHOM THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS OF THE PRESIDENCY ARE TO BE INVESTED. 
 
 
6. (C) THE BELGIAN AMBASSADOR DESCRIBED THE BELGIAN POSITION 
WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF LEGITIMACY AND THE MANNER IN 
WHICH THE GDRC IS PROCEEDING TO INAUGURATE JOSEPH KABILA AS 
FOLLOWS: 
 
-- THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA HAS CREATED 
A SITUATION OF URGENCY IN THE CONGO WHICH REQUIRES CONTINUITY 
AND SECURITY; 
 
-- GIVEN THAT THE ISSUE OF LEGITIMACY IS POSED, HOWEVER, A 
POLICY OF POLITICAL OPENNESS IS CRITICAL; 
 
-- IN THIS REGARD, EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON BEGINNING 
THIS POLICY OF OPENNESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL (WHILE POLITICIANS 
ARE ENGAGING IN THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, THERE SHOULD BE 
SIMULTANEOUS EFFORTS TO BEGIN ORGANIZING LOCAL ELECTIONS); 
AND, 
 
-- FINALLY, THE SEARCH FOR PEACE SHOULD BE PERMANENT. 
 
---------------- 
7. (C) COMMENT: 
---------------- 
 
THE CHALLENGE WITH WHICH THE CONGOLESE ARE GRAPPLING IS THAT 
OF HOW TO PRESERVE THE LEGACY OF LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA WHILE, 
SIMULTANEOUSLY, INSTITUTING THE COURSE CORRECTIONS REQUIRED 
TO PROPEL THE COUNTRY FORWARD TOWARD PEACE AND STABILITY AND 
POLITICAL OPENNESS.  JOSEPH KABILA IS CRITICAL TO MEETING 
THIS CHALLENGE SUCCESSFULLY.  THIS IS THE CASE BOTH BECAUSE 
OF HIS NAME, AS WELL AS HIS POSITION IN THE MILITARY, AND HIS 
OWN APPARENT DESIRE TO MOVE BEYOND THE CURRENT IMPASSE FACING 
THE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS.

AMBASSADOR SWING MET WITH PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE JOSEPH KABILA 
FOR AN HOUR LATE AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 25 AT KABILA\'S OAU 
VILLAGE OFFICE.  THE AMBASSADOR PRESENTED KABILA WITH 
PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE AND OFFERED HIS OWN 
VERBAL CONDOLENCES ON THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA. 
THE AMBASSADOR ALSO GAVE KABILA THE INVITATION TO THE 
CONGRESSIONAL NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST ON FEBRUARY 1; KABILA 
SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTICIPATING AND 
PROMISED HIS ANSWER JANUARY 26.  THE AMBASSADOR OUTLINED THE 
CONSIDERATIONS UNDERLYING THE EMBASSY\'S DRAWDOWN.  KABILA 
STRESSED THROUGHOUT THE TALK HIS PREOCCUPATION WITH THE WAR 
AND THE SUFFERING OF THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE; APPEALED FOR MONUC 
TO DEPLOY AND FOR RWANDAN AND UGANDAN TROOPS TO DEPART. 
KABILA GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING SEIZED WITH THE HEAVY 
RESPONSIBILITY HE HAS INHERITED, AND ACUTELY AWARE OF THE 
LEGITIMACY ISSUE POSED BY HIS SELECTION, WHICH SEEMS TO 
INCLINE HIM TOWARD A POLICY OF GREATER OPENNESS WITH REGARD 
TO THE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
2. (C) A \"PATRIOT WHO SYMBOLIZED OUR HOPES\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
THE AMBASSADOR, UNACCOMPANIED, MET WITH JOSEPH KABILA FOR AN 
HOUR ON JANUARY 25.  FOREIGN MINISTER OKITUNDU, PRESIDENT 
CABINET DIRECTOR GEORGES BUSE AND STATE SECURITY COUNCIL 
CHIEF NONO LUTULA WERE ALSO PRESENT. 
 
THE AMBASSADOR BEGAN BY PRESENTING PRESIDENT BUSH\'S 
CONDOLENCE MESSAGE TO KABILA, FOR WHICH KABILA EXPRESSED WARM 
APPRECIATION.  IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT BUSH\'S MESSAGE AND 
THE AMBASSADOR\'S VERBAL CONDOLENCES, JOSEPH KABILA DESCRIBED 
HIS LATE FATHER AS A \"PATRIOT WHO SYMBOLIZED THE CONGOLESE 
PEOPLE\'S HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS WHICH WE MUST NOW SHOULDER.\" 
THIS WILL NOT BE EASY, HE SAID, BUT \"WE ARE BOUND BY THE 
REALITIES WE FACE TO FIND SOLUTIONS.\" 
 
----------------------------------------- 
3. (C) KNITTING THE CONGO BACK INTO THE 
       WORLD\'S FABRIC 
----------------------------------------- 
 
PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE KABILA EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
\"MAKING CONTACTS\" WITH A WORLD \"THAT IS CHANGING FAST.\"  IN 
THIS REGARD HE SAID THAT ALREADY SINCE HIS FATHER\'S DEATH AND 
PARTICULARLY AT THE FUNERAL THIS WEEK, HE HAD SPOKEN WITH 
\"MANY\" FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVES, EACH WITH A SOMEWHAT 
DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT ON HOW BEST TO ADDRESS CONGO\'S PROBLEMS. 
FOR HIMSELF, THE MOST ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IS TO FIND A WAY TO 
END THE WAR.  THIS MEANS GETTING THE OCCUPYING ARMIES OUT OF 
THE DRC, AND IN THIS REGARD THE WORLD COMMUNITY, AND MOST 
ESPECIALLY THE U.S. AS ITS STRONGEST MEMBER, HAVE A SPECIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY.  EARLY ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO 
DEMOCRACY, ARE BEING DELAYED BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS 
\"OCCUPIED.\" 
 
--------------------------------- 
4. (C) WAR\'S FRUITS:  \"MAYHEM, 
       DESTRUCTION AND REFUGEES\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
THE DRC HAS NOW BEEN UNDER \"OCCUPATION,\" HE CONTINUED, FOR 
NEARLY THREE YEARS.  AS A RESULT, THERE HAS BEEN \"MUCH MAYHEM 
-- DESTRUCTION, MURDER, AND THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES AND 
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS.\"  THERE WERE NO CONGOLESE 
REFUGEES BEFORE THE WAR, HE ASSERTED, BUT TODAY CONGOLESE ARE 
FLEEING FROM BUNIA, FOR EXAMPLE, INTO UGANDA. 
 
RWANDA AND UGANDA JUSTIFY THE PRESENCE OF THEIR ARMIES IN THE 
CONGO ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY MUST COMBAT THE SECURITY 
THREAT WHICH THE INTERAHAMWE POSES, KABILA SAID.  THE 
INTERAHAMWE ARGUMENT CANNOT BE USED, HOWEVER, TO EXPLAIN WHY 
RWANDAN AND UGANDAN FORCES ARE SO DEEP INSIDE CONGOLESE 
TERRITORY, MORE THAN A THOUSAND KILOMETERS FROM THEIR 
BORDERS; NOR WILL THE INTERAHAMWE CLAIM ADEQUATELY JUSTIFY 
RWANDA\'S AND UGANDA\'S \"RIPPING OFF\" THE DRC\'S NATURAL 
RESOURCES FOR WHICH, HE OBSERVED, A SPECIAL UN COMMISSION OF 
INQUIRY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. 
 
----------------------------------- 
5. (C) RAISING CONGO WAR\'S PROFILE 
----------------------------------- 
 
THE WORLD SPEAKS ONLY OF THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE, BUT DOES NOT 
MENTION THAT 1.7 MILLION CONGOLESE ARE SAID TO HAVE DIED IN 
THE CONGO AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT WAR.  \"LET\'S NOT LET 
LAURENT KABILA DIE FOR NOTHING.\"  RATHER, HE SAID, KABILA\'S 
LIFE AND DEATH WERE A \"PEACE OFFERING.\"  HE URGED THE U.S TO 
LOOK AT THE CONGO \"IN A WIDER CONTEXT OF THE GREAT LAKES 
SUB-REGION,\" WHICH, HE SAID, IS WHAT HIS LATE FATHER WAS 
DOING  \"LET JUSTICE BE DONE,\" HE SAID.  FOR THIS TO HAPPEN, 
THE U.S. MUST TAKE ITS CONGO POLICY TO A \"HIGHER LEVEL.\" 
 
WHEN THEY MET, KABILA SAID HE HAD ASKED UN SRSG MORJANE WHERE 
THE UN TROOPS ARE.  FROM LATTER\'S RESPONSE, KABILA SAID, HE 
HAD THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE STILL A LONG WAYS OFF.  KABILA 
APPEALED TO THE AMBASSADOR FOR THE U.S. TO PUT \"PRESSURE\" ON 
RWANDA, UGANDA AND BURUNDI TO WITHDRAW THEIR TROOPS FROM THE 
DRC.  THEY SHOULD BE CONFRONTED AS TO WHY THEIR TROOPS ARE IN 
THE CONGO, THEN TOLD THAT EITHER THEY LEAVE, OR RISK 
INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS. 
 
-------------------------------- 
6. (C) POSSIBLE PRAYER BREAKFAST 
       PARTICIPATION 
-------------------------------- 
 
PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE KABILA EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE 
CONGRESSIONAL INVITATION TO THE ANNUAL NATIONAL PRAYER 
BREAKFAST ON FEBRUARY 1.  HE AGREED THAT THIS REPRESENTS A 
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY, TOO GOOD TO BE PASSED UP.  ON THE OTHER 
HAND, HE POINTED OUT THAT HIS PRIMARY CONCERN AT THE MOMENT 
IS FOR THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF THE CONGO.  THEREFORE, 
HE WOULD HAVE TO CONSULT WITH HIS CABINET COLLEAGUES; HE SAID 
THEY WOULD NEED TWELVE HOURS IN ORDER \"TO STUDY\" THE 
INVITATION.  HE ASKED FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THE PROGRAM AND 
A LIST OF THE OTHER FOREIGN HEADS OF STATE INVITED. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
7. (C) EMBASSY DRAWDOWN PRECAUTIONARY 
       AND TEMPORARY 
--------------------------------------- 
 
THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THE 
CONSIDERATIONS UNDERLYING THE EMBASSY\'S CURRENT DRAWDOWN OF 
ITS PERSONNEL COMPLEMENT.  HE DESCRIBED THE DRAWDOWN AS A 
\"PRECAUTIONARY, PRUDENT\" MEASURE.  THE DRAWDOWN IS TEMPORARY, 
NOT PERMANENT, AND IS NOT AN EVACUATION.  THE AMBASSADOR 
EMPHASIZED THAT THIS ACTION DOES NOT IN ANY WAY REFLECT ANY 
LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
HANDLED THE AFFAIRS OF STATE SINCE KABILA\'S DEATH; IN FACT, 
HE SAID, HE AND THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY GENERALLY HAD BEEN 
IMPRESSED WITH THEIR SMOOTH HANDLING OF THE TRANSITION. 
 
---------------- 
8. (C) COMMENT: 
---------------- 
 
ON THE EVE OF HIS OFFICIAL INAUGURATION AS PRESIDENT AND 
SUCCESSOR TO HIS SLAIN FATHER, JOSEPH KABILA, WHOM THE 
AMBASSADOR HAD LAST SEEN IN NOVEMBER, MADE THE IMPRESSION OF 
ONE WHO SENSES THAT, INEXORABLY, THE COMPLEX BURDENS OF THIS 
VAST, BELEAGUERED COUNTRY ARE COMING TO REST ON HIS 
SHOULDERS.  VARIOUS INTERESTS WITHIN THE DISPARATE, 
INTERNALLY-COMPETING AND OFTEN CONTRADICTORY POWER STRUCTURE 
ARE ALREADY VYING FOR HIS TIME AND ATTENTION AS THEY SEEK AT 
LEAST TO RETAIN, AND TO INCREASE IF POSSIBLE WHATEVER 
INFLUENCE THEY MAY HAVE HAD WITH HIS FATHER -- HENCE, THE 
THREE SENIOR PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEETING, FOR EXAMPLE.  THIS 
PERHAPS ALSO EXPLAINS JOSEPH KABILA\'S INSISTENCE ON USING 
ENGLISH THROUGH MOST OF THE CONVERSATION (A LANGUAGE IN WHICH 
NONE OF THE OTHER THREE PARTICIPANTS IS VERSED), ALTHOUGH HIS 
FRENCH IS FLUENT. 
 
ALTHOUGH AT FIRST IMPRESSION SHY, THE PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE IS 
SOFT-SPOKEN, BUT SELF-ASSURED AND ARTICULATE.  HE PROJECTS 
THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE AN APPEALING, PROFESSIONAL IMAGE FOR 
HIS COUNTRY.  HIS ACUTE AWARENESS OF THE LEGITIMACY ISSUE AND 
HIS OWN LIMITED EXPERIENCE MAY WELL INCLINE HIM TO REACH OUT 
AND OPEN UP THE POLITICAL PROCESS, SET A REASONABLE DATE FOR 
ELECTIONS, EVEN THOUGH MAKING THESE CONTINGENT UPON ALL OF 
THE BELLIGERENTS AND THE \"INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S\" 
SUCCESSFULLY SUING FOR PEACE AND A WITHDRAWAL OF RWANDAN AND 
UGANDAN FORCES. 
 
KABILA IMMEDIATELY GRASPED THE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY WHICH 
THE PRAYER BREAKFAST INVITATION REPRESENTS FOR THE DRC.  HE 
IS AGONIZING, HOWEVER, OVER THE DILEMMA OF SQUARING THIS 
TRIP, LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER HIS INAUGURATION, WITH HIS TOP 
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE OF MAINTAINING STABILITY AND CALM IN THE 
WAKE OF FATHER LAURENT KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION.

------------------- 
1. (C) SUMMARY: 
------------------- 
 
NEWLY-INAUGURATED PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA ADDRESSED THE 
CONGOLESE PEOPLE EVENING OF JANUARY 26.  HIS HALF HOUR 
ADDRESS SKILLFULLY THREADED HIS SLAIN FATHER\'S NAME AND 
LEGACY THROUGHOUT HIS REMARKS WITH COURSE CORRECTIONS ON 
ABOUT ALL MAJOR ISSUES AND AREAS OF CONCERN.  HIS 
REFORM-MINDED AGENDA HAS BEEN, OVERALL, WELL RECEIVED HERE, 
HELPING TO MAINTAIN THE CALM ALTHOUGH, NOW, THE CHALLENGE 
WILL BE TO INITIATE RATHER QUICKLY SOME CONCRETE MEASURES TO 
IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES KABILA HAS OUTLINED.  THERE IS A FAIRLY 
GENERALIZED RUMOR (AND EXPECTATION) THAT ONE SUCH EARLY 
MEASURE WILL BE A NEW GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE NAMING OF A 
PRIME MINISTER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
2. (C) REFORM-MINDED INAUGURAL REMARKS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
AWAITED WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION AND SOME ANXIETY LOCALLY, 
JOSEPH KABILA\'S INAUGURAL SPEECH SKILLFULLY EULOGIZED 
LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA\'S POLICIES WHILE, SIMULTANEOUSLY, 
ALTERING THEM, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS (SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE, HIS 
INSISTENCE THAT ELECTIONS COULD ONLY BE HELD AFTER RWANDAN 
AND UGANDAN TROOPS DEPART). 
 
-------------------------- 
3. (C) KABILA EULOGIZED 
-------------------------- 
 
JOSEPH KABILA BEGAN AND CONCLUDED HIS CAREFULLY-PREPARED 
HALF-HOUR ADDRESS WITH ELABORATE PRAISE FOR HIS LATE FATHER, 
PRESIDENT LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA. WHOM HE EULOGIZED VARIOUSLY 
AS \"ARCHITECT OF THE NATION\'S LIBERATION\" WHO \"REAWAKENED ITS 
NATIONAL CONSCIENCE...PRIDE AND DIGNITY\"; A \"VISIONARY,\" 
\"FORERUNNER\" AND \"STATESMAN.\" 
 
THE NEW PRESIDENT ASSERTED THAT KABILA WAS ONE OF THE \"RARE\" 
CONTEMPORARY LEADERS WHO CONTRACTED NO FOREIGN DEBT AND WHO 
DID NOT \"ENRICH\" HIMSELF, CALLING HIM \"AUSTERE,\" \"DISCREET, 
SIMPLE, HUMBLE, FRIENDLY, AND OF LARGE GENEROSITY.\"  LUMUMBA 
LED THE CONGO TO INDEPENDENCE, HE SAID, AND LAURENT KABILA 
\"STRUGGLED WITH HIS TRAGIC DEATH\" FOR THE CONGO.  JOSEPH 
KABILA ASSURED THE CONGOLESE PEOPLE THAT A \"JUDICIAL 
INVESTIGATION\" OF THE ASSASSINATION IS ALREADY UNDERWAY. 
 
--------------------------------- 
4. (C) A COMPREHENSIVE ROAD MAP 
--------------------------------- 
 
UNDER THE OVERALL RUBRIC OF A \"POLICY OF OVERTURE AND 
CHANGE,\" PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA ADDRESSED A SERIES OF 
\"CHALLENGES\" WHICH, HE SAID, THE CONGO (DRC) FACES, PREFACING 
THIS BY \"DEVOTING MYSELF TO MAKING DEEP CHANGES IN  ALL 
SECTORS OF NATIONAL LIFE.\"  AMONG THE MAJOR POLITICAL 
CHALLENGES, HE SAID, ARE: 
 
-- ESTABLISHING PEACE AND CONSOLIDATING NATIONAL COHESION. 
(THIS WILL REQUIRE THE \"IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL 
WITHDRAWAL OF THE AGGRESSOR STATES -- RWANDA, BURUNDI AND 
UGANDA.\"  IN THIS REGARD, HE PROMISED TO \"EXAMINE WAYS AND 
MEANS OF REVIVING THE LUSAKA ACCORD.\") 
 
-- NORMALIZATION OF DEMOCRATIC LIFE, WITH THE GOALS OF 
STRENGTHENING RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE, HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND JUSTICE. 
 
-- NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION, WHICH THE \"WAR OF AGGRESSION\" HAD 
SIDETRACKED. 
 
-- POLITICAL OPENNESS TO PERMIT ALL TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE 
THEIR RIGHTS.  HE UNDERLINED THAT POLITICAL ISSUES ARE TO BE 
RESOLVED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE 
AND HE CALLED FOR PURSUIT OF EFFORTS TO CONCLUDE THE 
\"LIBREVILLE PROCESS.\" 
 
-- JUDICIAL REFORM, STARTING WITH RESTRICTING THE MILITARY 
COURT TO TRYING MILITARY, NOT CIVILIAN AFFAIRS. 
 
-- FREE AND TRANSPARENT ELECTIONS \"ONCE PEACE IS ACHIEVED AND 
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY RESTORED.\" 
 
------------------------ 
5. (C) ECONOMIC REFORMS 
------------------------ 
 
NOTING THE DRAMATIC DECLINE IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY, KABILA 
PROPOSED SEVERAL ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION MEASURES TO REVIVE 
THE ECONOMY AND CREATE WEALTH TO FIGHT POVERTY: 
 
-- LIBERALIZING THE GOODS AND SERVICES MARKET IN THE DIAMOND 
SECTOR AND THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE SECTOR; 
 
-- AUTHORIZATION OF THE FREE CIRCULATION OF FOREIGN 
CURRENCIES CONCOMITANTLY WITH THE CONGOLESE FRANC; 
 
-- A NEW MINING CODE, AND A NEW INVESTMENT CODE; 
 
-- A FRAMEWORK FOR EXCHANGE OF VIEWS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR; AND, 
 
-- AN APPEAL TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO 
PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO THE CONGO\'S 
NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS. 
 
(HE OFFERED NO DETAILS ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES.) 
 
------------------------------- 
6. (C) A MORE ACTIVE CONGO IN 
       WORLD AFFAIRS 
------------------------------- 
 
STATING THAT THE DRC INTENDED TO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN 
WORLD AFFAIRS, KABILA ADDRESSED AFRICA (OAU, SADC, COMESA, 
AND SUPPORT FOR THE BURUNDI PEACE PROCESS OF MR. MANDELA). 
 
ON THE EUROPEAN UNION, HE SINGLED OUT FRANCE, LAUDING IT FOR 
ITS UNSC EFFORTS, AND BELGIUM, HOPING TO DEVELOP FRIENDLY 
TIES AND ENTENTE. 
 
AS REGARDS THE U.S., KABILA SAID HE WOULD NOT HIDE THE 
PERIODS OF MUTUAL MISUNDERSTANDING WITH THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION.  ON THE OTHER HAND, HE STATED THE INTENTION 
OF \"NORMALIZING\" BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH THE NEW BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION. 
 
THE NEW PRESIDENT REITERATED HIS GOVERNMENT\'S COMMITMENT TO 
COOPERATE WITH MONUC ON THE URGENT DEPLOYMENT OF ITS FORCES 
IN ORDER TO RESTORE PEACE. 
 
-------------- 
7.(C) COMMENT: 
-------------- 
 
AS A CONSENSUS DOCUMENT AT THIS JUNCTURE -- TEN DAYS AFTER 
PRESIDENT LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA\'S ASSASSINATION -- PRESIDENT 
JOSEPH KABILA\'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS IS ENCOURAGING, REFLECTING 
A SHIFT TOWARD THE REFORM AND MODERATE ELEMENTS IN THE 
CONGOLESE POWER STRUCTURE. 
 
WHILE MORE SPECIFICS WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE (SUCH AS, FOR 
EXAMPLE, A STATED INTENTION TO ABOLISH, OR AT LEAST MODIFY, 
DECREE 194 ON POLITICAL PARTIES) -- THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK, 
TONE AND THRUST OF JOSEPH KABILA\'S REMARKS POINT TOWARD A 
POLICY OF GREATER OPENNESS AND PERHAPS THE BEGINNING OF A 
RECONCILIATION PROCESS AND -- AT LAST, THE DEPLOYMENT OF 
MONUC. 
 
EVERYONE WILL NOW BE WATCHING CAREFULLY THE WILL AND CAPACITY 
OF JOSEPH KABILA AND THOSE AROUND HIM TO IMPLEMENT WHAT, FROM 
ALL ACCOUNTS, IS A PROGRAM THAT COULD PROPEL THE CONGO 
FORWARD.  IN THIS REGARD, PERHAPS THE FIRST NEXT STEP TO 
WATCH FOR WILL BE WHETHER OR NOT HE SHORTLY FORMS A NEW 
GOVERNMENT (INCLUDING A POSSIBLE PRIME MINISTER).

SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT DISMISSED:  STEP ONE IN CABINET 
RESHUFFLE 
 
 CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 1.5 
(B)(D) 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
1. (C) \"CURRENT AFFAIRS ONLY\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT ON FEBRUARY 7 PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA 
FORMALLY NOTIFIED ALL MEMBERS OF THE CABINET THAT THEY ARE 
DISMISSED AS FAR AS THEIR PRESENT MANDATE IS CONCERNED AND 
ARE, HENCEFORTH, TO ATTEND ONLY TO \"CURRENT AFFAIRS.\"  (THIS 
MEANS, AT A MINIMUM, NO NEW ACTIVITIES OR INITIATIVES UNTIL 
FURTHER NOTICE OR AS HE DIRECTS.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
2. (C) CLEARING THE WAY FOR CHANGE 
---------------------------------- 
 
IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED HERE THAT THIS FORMAL NOTICE TO THE 
MEMBERS OF THE LAST GOVERNMENT APPOINTED BY HIS FATHER, THE 
LATE PRESIDENT LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA, CLEARS THE WAY FOR 
PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA TO BEGIN CONSULTATIONS WHICH WILL 
LEAD TO A RESHUFFLED -- PROBABLY LARGELY NEW -- CABINET.  WE 
JUDGE, HOWEVER, THAT THE NEW TEAM IS NOT LIKELY TO BE 
ANNOUNCED OFFICIALLY UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTY-DAY PERIOD 
OF PUBLIC MOURNING, THAT IS, AROUND FEBRUARY 18. 
 
----------------------------- 
3. (C) ...AND CLEANING HOUSE 
----------------------------- 
 
AT ANY RATE, JOSEPH KABILA CAN USEFULLY USE A BIT MORE TIME 
AS HE SEEKS TO HIVE OFF SOME OF THE DEADWOOD IN THE CURRENT 
CABINET.  A GOODLY NUMBER OF THESE ARE NON-PERFORMERS AND 
OTHERS DOWNRIGHT OBSTRUCTIONISTS TO PROGRESS ON THE PEACE 
PROCESS AND THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS WHICH YOUNG 
KABILA HAS STATED HIS INTENTION TO CARRY OUT. 
 
------------------------------- 
4. (C) A PRIME MINISTER LIKELY 
------------------------------- 
 
MORE THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE LATE LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA 
ARRIVED IN KINSHASA IN 1997, THERE APPEARS TO BE A 
BETTER-THAN-FIFTY PERCENT CHANCE THAT A PRIME MINISTER WILL 
BE APPOINTED.  WHILE LAURENT-DESIRE KABILA WAS NEVER ABLE TO 
BRING HIMSELF TO SHARE POWER AND THE LIMELIGHT WITH A PRIME 
MINISTER, JOSEPH KABILA HAS SO FAR DEMONSTRATED THAT HE IS 
BETTER ORGANIZED AND LESS DEFENSIVE.  HE IS PROBABLY ALSO 
KEENLY AWARE OF THE ENORMITY OF HIS TASK AND SENSES THAT IT 
WOULD BE IN HIS AND THE CONGO\'S INTEREST FOR HIM TO HAVE 
SOMEONE AT HIS SIDE WHO COULD MANAGE THE DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS 
OF GOVERNMENT WHILE HE ENGAGES IN NEGOTIATIONS ON THE LARGER 
ISSUES OF PEACE AND RECONCILIATION. 
 
------------------------------------ 
5. (C) NO SHORTAGE OF PM CANDIDATES 
------------------------------------ 
 
THERE IS, IN THIS REGARD, WILD SPECULATION HERE ABOUT WHO THE 
PRIME MINISTER MIGHT BE.  THE NAMES MENTIONED MOST FREQUENTLY 
INCLUDE:  PLANNING MINISTER DENIS KALUME (WHO TOOK CHARGE OF 
THE KABILA FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS); MOBUTU\'S LAST PRIME 
MINISTER GERARD LIKULIA BOLONGO; AND PROFESSOR Z\'AHIDI NGOMA, 
HEAD OF A SMALL POLITICAL PARTY AND FORMER REBEL RCD 
OFFICIAL.  LESS OFTEN MENTIONED -- AND WHOSE APPOINTMENT 
WOULD BE FEARED BY MANY -- IS JUSTICE MINISTER MWENZE 
KONGOLO.  (OTHERS OF THE OLD GUARD AROUND LAURENT-DESIRE 
KABILA SUCH AS INTERIOR MINISTER KAKUDJI AND FORMER FOREIGN 
MINISTER YERODIA ARE BELIEVED TO BE ON THEIR WAY OUT, OR AT 
LEAST TO POSITIONS OF MUCH LESS IMPORT.)  CURRENT FOREIGN 
MINISTER OKITUNDU\'S NAME CAME UP INITIALLY IN THE PM RACE, 
BUT HE MAY NOT YET BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE QUITE THE HEFT 
REQUIRED AND, IN ANY CASE, HAS ALREADY MADE  HIMSELF TOO 
VALUABLE IN HIS SHORT TIME AS FOREIGN MINISTER TO BE RELEASED 
FOR OTHER DUTIES.

1. (C) \"NEW WINE IN NEW BOTTLES...?\" 
------------------------------------ 
 
IT WOULD BE IN OUR POLICY INTERESTS TO COME TO AN 
UNDERSTANDING EARLY IN BOTH THE NEW WASHINGTON AND KINSHASA 
ADMINISTRATIONS ON WAYS AND MEANS TO PUT US/CONGO (DRC) 
RELATIONS ON A NEW FOOTING.  IN THIS REGARD, THE ROADMAP, AS 
PROPOSED, IS DESIGNED TO CREATE MOMENTUM IN THE LUSAKA 
PROCESS.  IN SO DOING, THE POLITICAL WILL AND CAPACITY OF 
PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA TO UNDERTAKE A PROGRAM OF PEACE, 
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND ECONOMIC REFORM WILL ALSO BE PUT 
TO A TEST.  CLEARLY, OUR ABILITY TO MOVE TO A NEW LEVEL IN 
OUR RELATIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE DRC\'S COMMITMENT TO PROGRESS 
ON BOTH THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL TRACKS OF THE LUSAKA 
AGREEMENT.  OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN TO GROUP THE POINTS ALONG 
THE ROADMAP ACCORDING TO DEGREES OF DIFFICULTY IN 
IMPLEMENTING RATHER THAN THE MORE CUSTOMARY CATEGORIES OF 
SHORT-, MEDIUM-, AND LONG-TERM.  SEVERAL OF THE MEASURES HAVE 
BEEN RECENTLY PROPOSED IN MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT KABILA AND, 
AS SUCH, ARE ALREADY UNDER CONSIDERATION IN WASHINGTON. 
 
--------------------------------- 
2. (C) ROAD MAP TO BUILD A NEW 
       RELATIONSHIP WITH DRC 
--------------------------------- 
 
A.  STRAIGHT FORWARD 
-------------------- 
 
-- DISPATCH SENIOR BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL TO KINSHASA 
TO FOLLOW UP PRESIDENT KABILA\'S FEBRUARY 1 VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON WITH A MESSAGE OF SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO 
EXPEDITE THE LUSAKA PROCESS AND A DESIRE TO STRENGTHEN OUR 
BILATERAL TIES. 
 
-- PRESS FOR JMC AND JPC TO BE MOVED FROM LUSAKA TO THE DRC. 
AS AN INDUCEMENT, OFFER AN ADDITIONAL U.S. FINANCIAL 
CONTRIBUTION TO THE JMC. 
 
-- CENTRALIZE HENCEFORTH AT EMBASSY KINSHASA PHONE CALLS TO 
(AND OTHER CONTACTS WITH) REBEL LEADERS (BEMBA, ONUSUMBA, ET 
AL) IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE MIXED OR FALSE SIGNALS TO THE 
MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE.  (THIS WOULD RECTIFY THE CURRENT 
PERCEPTION THAT OUR POLICY IS BIFURCATED -- WITH THE EMBASSY 
DEALING WITH THE CONGOLESE GOVERNMENT AND WASHINGTON -- OR 
OUR EMBASSIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES -- WITH THE REBELS.) 
 
-- OFFER TO ASSIST PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA IN THE TRAINING OF 
A PROFESSIONAL \"CLOSE-IN\" PROTECTION TEAM. 
 
-- RESPOND POSITIVELY TO PRESIDENT KABILA\'S REQUEST FOR 
ASSISTANCE IN COMBATING CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT.  IN 
ADDITION TO MAKING AVAILABLE EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION ON US 
ANTI-CORRUPTION LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS AND MECHANISMS, USE 
GREAT LAKES JUSTICE INITIATIVE (GLJI) FUNDS TO ASSIST THE 
GDRC IN SETTING UP AN \"ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT\" OFFICE. 
 
-- COMPLETE BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR ACCEPTANCE AND REMOVAL 
OF ALL SPENT AND FRESH NUCLEAR FUEL RODS FROM THE NUCLEAR 
REACTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KINSHASA. 
 
-- INCLUDE THE CONGO (DRC) IN THE PRESIDENTIAL \"LIFE\" 
INITIATIVE ON HIV/AIDS. 
 
-- MAKE AVAILABLE DOD FUNDING TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS IN THE 
CONGOLESE MILITARY (FAC). 
 
-- ANNOUNCE FY-2001 US AID PROGRAM LEVELS.  INCLUDE 
ADDITIONAL OFDA FUNDS FOR SEVERE ONGOING HUMANITARIAN 
EMERGENCIES IN THE CONGO. 
 
-- ESTABLISH A \"PEACE FUND\" FOR BUNIA TO SUPPORT LOCAL 
INITIATIVES TO RESOLVE THE HEMA/LENDU CONFLICT. 
 
-- SEND OPDAT (DOJ) DIRECTOR CARL ALEXANDER TO KINSHASA FOR 
INITIAL EXPLORATORY DISCUSSIONS ON JUDICIAL REFORM, INCLUDING 
THE POSSIBLE FUTURE TRAINING OF MAGISTRATES (GLJI) ONCE 
LEGISLATIVE RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED. 
 
-- ENSURE THAT THE PROMISED U.S. CONTRIBUTION OF $1 MILLION 
IS AVAILABLE TO FUND THE CONGOLESE NATIONAL DIALOGUE. 
 
B. MORE DIFFICULT 
----------------- 
 
-- DEVISE A SCENARIO LINKING IMPLEMENTATION OF GDRC ECONOMIC 
REFORM TO ENHANCED COOPERATION.  FOR EXAMPLE:  (A) CONSULT 
WITH GDRC TO CREATE A PROGRAM THAT WOULD CLEAR ARREARS, LIFT 
BROOKE SANCTIONS, AND REMOVE OTHER IMPEDIMENTS TO 
GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT BILATERAL AID TO THE DRC; (B) 
ANNOUNCE THAT ADOPTION OF A SHADOW IMF PROGRAM WILL TRIGGER 
USG PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD BANK CONGO TRUST FUND; (C) 
SIGN AN OPIC AGREEMENT AFTER THE GDRC ADOPTS A REVISED 
INVESTMENT CODE, AND (D) SEND A STATE/TREASURY TECHNICAL 
MISSION TO CHART A PLAN (IN CONSULTATION WITH THE GDRC) FOR 
CONGOLESE QUALIFICATION FOR HIPC DEBT RELIEF. 
 
-- URGE WORLD BANK PRESIDENT JAMES WOLFENSOHN AND IMF 
MANAGING DIRECTOR HORST KOHLER TO INCLUDE A BRIEF STOP IN 
KINSHASA DURING THEIR FORTHCOMING VISIT TO BAMAKO, ABUJA, DAR 
ES SALAAM, AND NAIROBI, FEBRUARY 18-25. 
 
-- COORDINATE MORE CLOSELY WITH THE FRENCH.  IN SO DOING, (A) 
EXAMINE THE FRENCH  PROPOSAL TO DEPLOY UN PEACEKEEPING TROOPS 
AT THE BORDER BETWEEN THE CONGO AND RWANDA, WHICH THE FRENCH 
VIEW AS THE \"HEART OF THE PROBLEM\"; AND (B) CALIBRATE US 
SUPPORT FOR THE FRENCH DEMAND THAT A \"DATE CERTAIN\" BE SET 
FOR RWANDAN/UGANDAN TROOP WITHDRAWAL IN RETURN FOR FRENCH 
SUPPORT FOR DDRR OF EX-FAZ/INTERAHAMWE -- ALL THE WHILE 
AVOIDING ANY LINKAGE BETWEEN THE WITHDRAWAL AND \"NEGATIVE 
FORCES\" ISSUES. 
 
-- INSIST THAT ALL PARTIES RETREAT TO POSITIONS DECLARED IN 
KAMPALA DISENGAGEMENT PLAN.  (THIS WOULD REQUIRE RWANDA TO 
WITHDRAW FROM PWETO.)  INSIST THAT MONUC DEPLOY TO PWETO 
WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. 
 
-- PRESS THE GDRC THAT THE KINSHASA OFFICE OF NATIONAL 
DIALOGUE FACILITATOR MASIRE SHOULD BE RE-OPENED. 
 
C.  DIFFICULT 
------------- 
 
-- INCLUDE CONGO (DRC) ON ANY SECSTATE VISIT TO AFRICA. 
 
-- STRONG DEMARCHE TO RWANDA AND UGANDA FOR ACCELERATED 
WITHDRAWAL OF THEIR  TROOPS. 
 
-- OFFER DOD REIMBURSABLE AIRLIFT SUPPORT FOR MONUC 
DEPLOYMENT. 
 
-- FREEZE IMET AND E-IMET FOR RWANDA AND UGANDA UNTIL THEIR 
TROOPS WITHDRAW FROM THE DRC; ONCE TROOP WITHDRAWAL IS 
ACCOMPLISHED, DEVELOP BALANCED IMET PROGRAM FOR THE GREAT 
LAKES SUB-REGION TO INCLUDE THE CONGO (DRC) AS IT SEEKS TO 
RE-STRUCTURE ITS ARMED FORCES. 
 
-- PROPOSE US-FUNDED FIVE-YEAR DOJ/ICITAP POLICE TRAINING 
PROGRAM. 
 
-- SUPPORT A CALL FOR REPARATIONS BY RWANDA AND UGANDA FOR

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (S) WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT LAURENT KABILA\'S GUNSHOT 
WOUNDS WERE FATAL, CHIEF OF STAFF GEORGES BUSE AND DEPUTY 
CHIEF OF STAFF JEAN MBUYU, IN CONSULTATION WITH SEVERAL OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CABINET, MET TO DECIDE ON A 
SUCCESSOR.  THEY SETTLED ON HIS SON JOSEPH AS THE ONLY PERSON 
WHO COULD HOLD TOGETHER VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY 
FACTIONS.  THE TASK OF SELLING THEIR CHOICE TO OTHER POWER 
BROKERS WAS NOT EASY.  OLD GUARD HARD-LINERS KAKUDJI, MWENZE, 
AND YERODIA RESISTED.  KAKUDJI REPORTEDLY WANTED TO BE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF.  MILITARY COMMANDERS ALSO HAD TO BE 
CONVINCED, BUT THIS WASN\'T AS DIFFICULT SINCE JOSEPH WAS WELL 
KNOWN AND GENERALLY RESPECTED WITHIN THE MILITARY.  AN 
UNEXPECTED OBSTACLE WAS JOSEPH\'S INITIAL RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT 
THE OFFER.  ONCE THIS WAS OVERCOME, BUSE AND MBUYU PRESENTED 
JOSEPH KABILA TO THE REST OF THE GOVERNMENT AS THE NEW 
PRESIDENT. 
 
2. (C) BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION FOR JEAN MBUYU IS INCLUDED IN 
THIS CABLE.  BIO DATA FOR OTHER KEY PLAYERS IN JOSEPH 
KABILA\'S GOVERNMENT WILL FOLLOW SEPTEL ONCE THE NEW CABINET 
IS SELECTED (ANNOUNCEMENT IS REPORTED TO BE IMMINENT.) 
 
 
-------------------- 
CHOOSING A SUCCESSOR 
-------------------- 
 
3. (S) A HIGHLY RELIABLE EMBASSY CONTACT RELATED TO POLOFF 
MARCH 25 A RECENT CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH PRESIDENTIAL 
ADVISOR JEAN MBUYU.  MBUYU, CURRENTLY SERVING AS JOSEPH 
KABILA\'S SPECIAL ADVISOR FOR SECURITY, WAS LAURENT KABILA\'S 
DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ASSASSINATED. 
ACCORDING TO MBUYU, HE AND CHIEF OF STAFF GEORGES BUSE WERE 
THE PRIMARY PLAYERS IN SELECTING LAURENT KABILA\'S SUCCESSOR. 
 
4. (S) MBUYU TOLD CONTACT THAT IT WAS CLEAR WITHIN HOURS 
AFTER HE HAD BEEN SHOT THAT LAURENT KABILA WAS NOT GOING TO 
SURVIVE.  MBUYU SAID THAT HE AND CHIEF OF STAFF GEORGES BUSE, 
IN CONSULTATION WITH SEVERAL OTHER UNSPECIFIED MEMBERS OF 
LAURENT KABILA\'S PRESIDENTIAL CABINET, SAT DOWN THE EVENING 
OF JANUARY 16 TO DECIDE ON A SUCCESSOR.  JOSEPH WAS THEIR 
IMMEDIATE AND OBVIOUS CHOICE.  IN THEIR VIEW, HE WAS HE ONLY 
PERSON WHO COULD UNIFY THE VARIOUS FACTIONS WITHIN THE 
GOVERNMENT AND COMMAND THE RESPECT OF THE MILITARY. 
 
5. (S) BUSE AND MBUYU WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT 
MAINTAINING THE LOYALTY OF THE VARIOUS MILITARY FACTIONS, 
SINCE THE FAC HAD BEEN PIECED TOGETHER FROM UNITS THAT WERE 
RECRUITED AND TRAINED IN DIFFERENT REGIONS.  MOST WERE 
RECRUITED IN KATANGA AND THE KIVUS; SOME HAD BEEN TRAINED IN 
ANGOLA AND ZIMBABWE.  BUSE AND MBUYU BELIEVED THAT JOSEPH WAS 
THE ONLY FIGURE WHO WOULD BE PERCEIVED TO HAVE LEGITIMACY IN 
THE EYES OF THE DIVERSE MILITARY COALITIONS.  HE HAD VISITED 
ALL OF THE CAMPS DURING HIS TENURE AS COMMANDER OF GROUND 
FORCES, AND HAD MARCHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THEM IN 
1996-97.  IN THEIR VIEW, KABILA WAS WELL REGARDED BY THE 
ARMED FORCES. 
 
6. (S) MBUYU SAID THAT HE AND BUSE INSTRUCTED MILITARY AIDE 
DE CAMP EDDY KAPEND TO GO ON TELEVISION THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 
16TH TO APPEAL FOR CALM AND ORDER.  AS A MEMBER OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CABINET, KAPEND WAS THE MOST ACCESSIBLE MILITARY 
OFFICER.  PERHAPS MORE CRUCIAL, BUSE AND MBUYU JUDGED THAT 
KAPEND HAD THE SUPPORT OF GENERAL YAV NAWEJ, WHO DESPITE HIS 
ARREST \"REMAINS A POWERFUL MILITARY FIGURE, RESPECTED AND 
FEARED BY THE FAC IN KINSHASA.\" 
 
 
-------------------- 
MAKING THE HARD SELL 
-------------------- 
 
7. (S) BUSE AND MBUYU WERE REPORTEDLY CONVINCED THEY WOULD 
HAVE A HARD TIME PERSUADING HARD-LINERS KAKUDJI, MWENZE, AND 
YERODIA TO ACCEPT JOSEPH.  INTERIOR MINISTER KAKUDJI PROVED 
TO BE THE TOUGHEST SELL, AS HE HIMSELF HAD PRESIDENTIAL 
ASPIRATIONS.  MBUYU DID NOT INDICATE WHAT DEALS MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN STRUCK TO OBTAIN KAKUDJI\'S APPROVAL, BUT DID SAY THAT 
AFTER MUCH ARM TWISTING AND INTERNAL \"SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY\" 
KAKUDJI EVENTUALLY RELENTED.  JUSTICE MINISTER MWENZE KONGOLO 
AND ABDOULAYE YERODIA (FORMERLY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
NOW MINISTER OF EDUCATION) WERE RESISTANT AT FIRST BUT GAVE 
IN MORE EASILY THAN KAKUDJI. 
 
8. (S) MBUYU SAID THAT HE AND BUSE NEXT APPROACHED THE KEY 
MILITARY COMMANDERS (CONTACT REPORTED MBUYU SPECIFICALLY 
MENTIONED GENERAL LWETCHA) TO GET THEIR APPROVAL.  THIS 
WASN\'T A PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO MBUYU, SINCE JOSEPH IS WELL 
REGARDED IN THE MILITARY, AND THE COMMANDERS WERE PLEASED 
THAT SOMEONE WITH AN ARMY BACKGROUND WOULD ASSUME CONTROL. 
 
9. (S) THE FINAL HURDLE WAS CONVINCING JOSEPH HIMSELF OF THE 
PLAN.  THIS PROVED TO BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN EXPECTED AS 
JOSEPH WAS INITIALLY \"VERY RESISTANT\" TO THE IDEA.  MBUYU DID 
NOT CONVEY JOSEPH\'S REASONS FOR BALKING AT THE PROPOSAL 
(JOSEPH MAY NOT HAVE PROVIDED AN EXPLANATION) BUT MBUYU 
SPECULATED THAT PERSONAL SECURITY WAS PROBABLY CHIEF AMONG 
HIS CONCERNS. 
 
10. (S) ONCE THEY HAD SECURED JOSEPH\'S AGREEMENT, BUSE AND 
MBUYU CONVOKED ALL GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND PRESENTED JOSEPH 
KABILA AS THE SUCCESSOR TO HIS FATHER.  \"HERE IS YOUR NEW 
PRESIDENT,\" IS HOW MBUYU DESCRIBED THE ANNOUNCEMENT.  \"THERE 
WAS LITTLE DISCUSSION,\" REPORTED MBUYU.  THE TWENTY THREE 
OTHER MINISTERS LOOKED TO KAKUDJI, MWENZE, AND YERODIA TO 
GAUGE WHETHER OR NOT JOSEPH HAD THEIR SUPPORT.  \"THE DEAL WAS 
SEALED\" WHEN THESE THREE KEY FIGURES EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT 
(OR AT LEAST DIDN\'T EXPRESS OPPOSITION).  ACCORDING TO MBUYU, 
ALL THAT REMAINED WERE THE \"DETAILS\" OF ANNOUNCING THE 
SUCCESSION AND FIGURING OUT UNDER WHAT LEGAL AUTHORITY JOSEPH 
COULD BE NAMED PRESIDENT. 
 
--------------------------- 
BIO INFORMATION: JEAN MBUYU 
--------------------------- 
 
11. (C) SAID TO BE IN HIS MID-FORTIES, \"MBUYU\" IS A MULUBA 
FROM NORTH KATANGA (OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A \"MULUBAKAT.\")  HIS 
MOTHER IS RUMORED TO BE RWANDAN, A CLAIM THAT HAS ALSO BEEN 
MADE OF JOSEPH KABILA.  MBUYU ATTENDED LAW SCHOOL AND 
PRACTICED LAW IN LUBUMBASHI, EVENTUALLY BECOMING HEAD OF THE 
LUBUMBASHI BAR ASSOCIATION IN 1991.  MBUYU CREATED A HUMAN 
RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN LUBUMBASHI CALLED \"THE COMMITTEE FOR 
THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS\" (CDH), WHICH STILL EXISTS TODAY. 
 MBUYU GAINED A MEASURE OF PROMINENCE IN 1990 WHEN HE WAS 
JAILED FOR DENOUNCING THE STUDENT MASSACRE OF MAY 12, 1990 IN 
LUBUMBASHI.  JESUIT MISSIONARIES PRESSURED THE GOVERNMENT TO 
RELEASE HIM.  MBUYU PARTICIPATED IN THE NATIONAL SOVEREIGN 
CONFERENCE OF 1991-2 AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF KATANGAN CIVIL 
SOCIETY AND BECAME A MEMBER OF THE TRANSITIONAL PARLIAMENT 
UNDER MOBUTU.  MBUYU WAS AN EMBASSY IV PARTICIPANT IN 1991 
AND LATER A \"FELLOW\" AT THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW 
GROUP IN WASHINGTON, DC FROM 1994-96.  MBUYU SUBSEQUENTLY 
ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL AND RECEIVED 
HIS L.L.M. IN 1997.  HIS WIFE, A NURSE, REPORTEDLY STILL 
LIVES IN INDIANA.  PROBABLY DUE IN PART TO FAMILY TIES (MBUYU 
IS SAID TO BE LAURENT KABILA\'S COUSIN), KABILA CHOSE MBUYU TO 
BE HIS LEGAL ADVISOR.  KABILA THEN PROMOTED MBUYU TO DEPUTY 
CHIEF OF STAFF.  FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT\'S ASSASSINATION, 
MBUYU CONTINUED TO SERVE AS POLITICAL ADVISOR TO JOSEPH 
KABILA AND ALSO ACTED AS HIS LIAISON WITH THE POLITICAL 
OPPOSITION (REF A).  JOSEPH KABILA APPOINTED MBUYU SPECIAL 
ADVISOR FOR SECURITY ON MARCH 8.  MBUYU SPEAKS ENGLISH BUT 
PREFERS FRENCH. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12. (C) THE REPLACEMENT OF CHIEF OF STAFF GEORGES BUSE WITH 
THEOPHILE MBEMBA (THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF KINSHASA) LEAVES 
JEAN MBUYU AS THE ONLY \"KING MAKER\" IN JOSEPH\'S GOVERNMENT. 
THIS APPEARS TO AFFORD HIM CONSIDERABLE CLOUT IN THE NEW 
ADMINISTRATION.  THAT SEVERAL OF MBUYU\'S CLOSE COLLEAGUES 
WERE TAPPED TO OTHER POSITIONS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CABINET 
(REF B), AND THAT JOSEPH HAS RELIED ON MBUYU FOR SEVERAL KEY 
TASKS (SUCH AS LIAISON WITH THE OPPOSITION) APPEAR TO CONFIRM 
HIS GROWING INFLUENCE. 
 
13. (C) IF THE SCENARIO DESCRIBED ABOVE IS ACCURATE, IT IS 
SURPRISING THAT MBUYU HIMSELF WAS NOT CHOSEN TO BE CHIEF OF 
STAFF.  JOSEPH MAY PREFER TO RELY ON MBUYU AS A TRUSTED 
ADVISOR RATHER THAN PLACING HIM DIRECTLY IN CHARGE OF HIS 
STAFF.  OR, CONSCIOUS OF MBUYU\'S KEY ROLE IN HIS OWN 
SELECTION, JOSEPH MAY BE LEERY OF GIVING HIM TOO MUCH POWER.

SUBJECT: KABILA ADDRESSES NATION, ANNOUNCES REFORMS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR WILLIAM LACY SWING FOR REASONS 
1.5(B)(D) 
 
 
1. (C) PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA ADDRESSED THE NATION AT THE 
KIMBANGUIST CENTER MAY 17 ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF 
MOBUTU\'S OVERTHROW.  IN THIS, HIS FIRST PUBLIC ADDRESS HERE 
SINCE HIS INAUGURATION ON JANUARY 26, KABILA ANNOUNCED THE 
FOLLOWING MEASURES IN A BRIEF, LOW-KEY ADDRESS WHICH OFFERED 
FEW DETAILS. 
 
-- REPLACEMENT OF CONTROVERSIAL DECREE 194 WITH OTHER 
GUIDELINES FOR POLITICAL PARTY ACTIVITY; 
 
-- AMNESTY FOR ALL THOSE PRISONERS WHO HAVE NOT COMMITTED 
SERIOUS CRIMES SUCH AS MURDER (WE UNDERSTAND THAT ABOUT 340 
DETAINEES IN ALL WILL BE FREED); AND, 
 
-- SOCIO-ECONOMIC MEASURES TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO THE 
POPULATION. 
 
2. (C) ALTHOUGH NOT IN HIS REMARKS, SEVERAL MINISTERS 
CONFIRMED TO THE AMBASSADOR ON MAY 17 THE FOLLOWING 
ADDITIONAL POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS: 
 
-- THE FOUR CHILD-SOLDIERS WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS 
FEARED HAD BEEN EXECUTED HAVE, IN FACT, BEEN RELEASED THIS 
WEEK (AND HAD NOT BEEN TORTURED); AND, 
 
-- THE NINETEEN \"KADOGO\" SOLDIERS FROM THE LATE PRESIDENT 
LAURENT KABILA\'S PROTECTION UNIT HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED (AS 
HAD BEEN RUMORED) AND HUMAN RIGHTS MINISTER NTUMBA, WITH WHOM 
THE AMBASSADOR SPOKE ON MAY 17, HAS BEEN TO MAKALA PRISON 
THIS WEEK TO VISIT THEM. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH OPINION SEEMS SOMEWHAT DIVIDED ON 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PRESIDENT KABILA\'S REMARKS, GIVEN THE 
ABSENCE OF DETAIL, THE MORE GENERAL VIEW IS POSITIVE.  BASED 
ON THE AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH KABILA ON MAY 14, IT IS 
CLEAR THAT HE IS KEENLY AWARE OF THE URGENT NEED FOR 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS, AND THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE A 
PROMISING BEGINNING.

TAGS: PTER, CG 
SUBJECT: DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO: 2001 ANNUAL 
TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 198912 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  THE GDRC PLAYED A POSITIVE, IF VERY MINOR, ROLE 
ON TERRORISM ISSUES DURING 2001.  NONETHELESS, EASTERN DRC IS 
UNDER CONTROL OF REBEL FORCES AND CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY 
SEVERE DISORDER AND BANDITRY IN LARGE AREAS.  WHETHER ANY OF 
THIS ACTIVITY CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS TERRORISM IS QUESTIONABLE, 
BUT THE DISRUPTION IT CAUSES IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IS 
NOT.  THE GOVERNMENT OF JOSEPH KABILA HAS RESPONDED 
POSITIVELY ON MATTERS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM SINCE THE 
TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  POST\'S DETAILED RESPONSE 
 
A)  SUPPORT FOR THE GLOBAL COALITION 
 
SUBSEQUENT TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11 THE GDRC 
HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF US REPRESENTATION ON 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM ISSUES.  THAT SAID THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO REMAINS A DIVIDED COUNTRY WITH REBEL GROUPS 
IN CONTROL OF ABOUT HALF ON THE COUNTRY.  IN REBEL-CONTROLLED 
TERRITORY THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DISORDER, AND UNCONTROLLED 
ARMED GROUPS ROAM FREELY.  BANDITRY AND DISORDER ARE 
COMMONPLACE.  THIS ACTIVITY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ORGANIZED 
TERRORISM, ALTHOUGH SOME UNCONTROLLED ARMED GROUPS HAVE THE 
GOAL OF DESTABILIZING NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. 
 
B) TERRORIST INCIDENTS THWARTED, AND TERRORIST CELLS BROKEN 
UP, DURING 2001. 
 
NONE 
 
C) RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
DURING 2001 
 
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE DRC REMAINS IN A STATE OF 
DYSFUNCTION.  SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL CASES ARE TRIED IN 
MILITARY COURTS, IN WHICH DUE PROCESS STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW. 
 NO TERRORISM CASES WERE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN TRIED IN 2001. 
 
D) EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS 
 
NO EXTRADITION REQUESTS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DRC WERE 
MADE DURING 2001. 
 
E) SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION 
AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS 
 
THERE IS NO EXTRADITION TREATY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND DRC, BUT 
THERE ARE NO IMPEDIMENTS TO DOMESTIC PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS IN THE DRC. 
 
F) HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION 
 
PRESIDENT KABILA WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO OFFER HIS AND HIS 
COUNTRY\'S CONDOLENCES FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST 
ATTACKS IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO 
MADE PUBLIC STATEMENTS AGAINST TERRORISM. 
 
G) MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 2001 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF DRC MAINTAINS AN EXTENSIVE INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICE, WHICH, INTER ALIA, CONDUCTS COUNTER-TERRORISM 
ACTIVITIES.  NO SPECIFIC COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS, I.E., 
THOSE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, ARE KNOWN TO 
HAVE BEEN MADE DURING 2001 
 
H) SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM 
 
NONE 
 
I) PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE 
 
NONE 
 
J) SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 2001 IN THE HOST GOVERNMENT\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM 
 
SINCE JOSEPH KABILA TOOK POWER AFTER HIS FATHER\'S 
ASSASSINATION, THE GOVERNMENT OF DRC HAS BEHAVED IN A MUCH 
MORE RESPONSIBLE MANNER.  RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA, LIBYA 
AND CUBA, FOR INSTANCE, REMAIN FRIENDLY, BUT THE FREQUENCY OF 
VISITS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO THOSE COUNTRIES HAS 
DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY.  MOST PROBABLY, THE PRINCIPAL REASON 
FOR THE CHANGE IS THE FACT THAT JOSEPH KABILA HAS A BROADER 
WORLD-VIEW THAN HIS FATHER, WHO RECEIVED HIS POLITICAL 
EDUCATION DURING THE 60S. 
 
K) U.S. COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES WITH THE 
DRC GOVERNMENT 
 
NO INSTANCES OF COOPERATION ON TERRORISM BETWEEN THE U.S. AND 
DRC WERE RECORDED DURING 2001.  THE DRC MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICE HAS RESPONDED FAVORABLY TO A USDAO REQUEST FOR 
COLLABORATION AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO 
PROFESS ITS READINESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. ON TERRORISM 
ISSUES. 
 
L) COOPERATION FROM THE DRC GOVERNMENT DURING THE PREVIOUS 
FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF AN ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
 
NONE 
 
   (I) EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 2001 COOPERATED 
OR IS COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN 
APPREHENDING, CONVICTING, AND PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR 
INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACT; 
 
NONE 
 
   (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 2001 
COOPERATED OR IS COOPERATING IN PREVENTING FURTHER ACTS OF 
TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT\'S TERRITORY. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DRC HAS RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO U.S. 
DEMARCHES ON ADHERENCE TO ANTI-TERRORISM CONVENTIONS, 
ALTHOUGH TO DATE RATIFICATIONS OF THOSE ANTI-TERRORISM 
CONVENTIONS TO WHICH THE DRC IS NOT A PARTY HAVE NOT BEEN 
COMPLETED. 
 
M) EXTENT TO WHICH THE HOST GOVERNMENT IN 2001 COOPERATED 
WITH OTHER ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS 
 
THE U.S. SOUGHT AND OBTAINED CLOSURE OF A STREET IN FRONT OF 
THE EMBASSY.  THE CLOSURE IS PERMANENT AND A BARRIER WILL BE 
CONSTRUCTED TO ENSURE THAT IT REMAINS SO.  THE GOVERNMENT 
ALSO GRANTED PERMISSION FOR THE EMBASSY SURVEILLANCE 
DETECTION UNIT TO OPERATE IN PLAIN CLOTHES, WHICH GREATLY 
INCREASES THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, RW 
SUBJECT: THE KABILA GOVERNMENT:  THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR AUBREY HOOKS FOR REASONS 1/5 B/D. 
 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
1.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT OF JOSEPH KABILA FEELS MUCH PUT UPON 
THESE DAYS AND FRUSTRATED THAT IT HAS FEW OPTIONS TO EXERCISE 
IN TERMS OF SHAPING THE WORLD AROUND IT.  IT IS FEELING THE 
PRESSURE OF OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOG 
(ICD) FOR WHICH IT WAS ILL PREPARED, IT HAS BEEN HUMILIATED 
IN MOLIRO, ITS ALLIES ARE GIVING TEPID SUPPORT AS THEY PURSUE 
THEIR OWN INTERESTS, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REMAINS 
RESERVED.  KABILA VALUES USG APPROVAL AND ENCOURAGEMENT, AND 
THAT GIVES US SOME LIMITED LEVERAGE TO INFLUENCE HIM TO 
CONTINUE REFORMS TO TO GRAPPLE WITH TOUGH DECISIONS HE NEEDS 
TO MAKE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  THE FRACTURED OPPOSITION -- ARMED REBEL GROUPS, 
POLITICAL PARTIES, AND CIVIL SOCIETY -- ARE UNITED ON ONE 
BASIC POINT:  THEY WANT A SLICE OF THE PIE IN KINSHASA.  THE 
ARMED GROUPS CONTROL AROUND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY, BUT 
THEY DO NOT CONTROL KINSHASA AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE THIN 
VENEER OF LEGITIMACY THAT THE INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION 
ACCORDS TO KABILA.  THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND CIVIC GROUPS 
ARE HUNGRY AND JUST WANT IN. 
 
3.  (C)  UNFORTUNATELY, THE KABILA GOVERNMENT HAS ILL 
PREPARED ITSELF FOR THE ICD IN SUN CITY.  THE GOVERNMENT, TO 
ITS CREDIT, DID MAKE SOME OVERTURES TO JEAN-PIERRE BEMBA OF 
THE MLC.  THE FACT THAT THESE OVERTURES HAVE NOT BORNE MUCH 
FRUIT IS AS MUCH DUE TO THE UNBRIDLED AMBITIONS OF BEMBA AS 
IT IS TO THE HALF-HEARTED NATURE OF KABILA\'S EFFORTS. 
ONUSUMBA OF THE RCD, VERY MUCH UNDER RWANDA\'S THUMB, IS 
BASICALLY BEYOND THE PALE AND WOULD ONLY BE COURTED AS AN 
ALLY BY KABILA AS A VERY LAST RESORT.  HOWEVER, THE 
GOVERNMENT MADE ONLY SPORADIC EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO CIVIL 
SOCIETY AND POLITICAL PARTIES.  THE GOVERNMENT DID MANAGE TO 
PERSUADE MASIRE TO ENLARGE THE POLITICAL PARTY CONTINGENT TO 
INCLUDE SOME POLITICAL FIGURES COOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT, BUT 
ONLY AT THE COST OF ANTAGONIZING WHAT PASSES AS THE POLITICAL 
CLASS IN KINSHASA. 
 
4.  (C) THE KABILA GOVERNMENT IS HAVING TROUBLE COMING TO 
GRIPS WITH THE IDEA OF SHARING POWER.  CERTAINLY, LAURENT 
KABILA NEVER CAME TO GRIPS WITH THAT CONCEPT.  JOSEPH HAS 
COME TO THAT CONCLUSION ONLY RELUCTANTLY AND AT GREAT 
RESISTANCE WITHIN HIS OWN CAMP, BUT SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN 
LITTLE THOUGHT AS TO HOW TO APPROACH THE NEGOTIATIONS OTHER 
THAN TRYING TO PUT HIS OWN POSITION AS PRESIDENT OFF LIMITS. 
CONVERSATIONS WITH KABILA AND FOREIGN MINISTER OKITUNDU (THE 
HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IN SUN CITY) INDICATE THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT CAME UP WITH HARD-LINE OPENING POSITIONS AND, 
DEPENDING ON THE REACTIONS, WILL THEN ADJUST THOSE POSITIONS. 
 IT HAS GIVEN LITTLE THOUGHT TO FALLBACK POSITIONS, LET ALONE 
DEVELOPING AN ACTIVE STRATEGY TO GUIDE THE INEVITABLE 
COMPROMISES THAT MUST EMERGE AT THE ICD. 
 
5.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT MADE TACTICAL ERRORS IN WALKING OUT 
OF THE ICD BOTH IN ADDIS ABABA AND IN SUN CITY. KABILA AND 
OKITUNDU ARE AWARE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS 
QUESTIONING THE GOVERNNENT\'S COMMITMENT TO THE DIALOG. 
 
 
MOLIRO HUMILIATION 
 
6.  (C)  THE FALL OF MOLIRO, A SMALL BUT STRATEGIC PORT ON 
LAKE TANGANYIKA, ON MARCH 16 TO RCD FORCES HAS BEEN A PAINFUL 
HUMILIATION TO THE GOVERNMENT. BUT EVEN IN THE CASE OF 
MOLIRO, THE GOVERNMENT GARNERS LITTLE SYMPATHY AS THE WRONGED 
PARTY.  THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT DECLARE MOLIRO AS A NEW 
DEFENSIVE POSITION IN THE HARARE SUB-ACCORDS AND THUS WAS IN 
VIOLATION OF THE LUSAKA ACCORDS.  FURTHERMORE, THE GOVERNMENT 
HAD BEEN GUILTY OF USING MOLIRO AS A BASE FOR SUPPLYING 
MAI-MAI AND HUTU MILITIAMEN AND FOR HARRASSING RCD AND 
RWANDAN FORCES NORTH ALONG THE LAKE SHORE, SOMETHING WHICH 
THE GOVERNMENT CONSISTENTLY DENIED. 
 
 
NO MILITARY OPTION 
 
7.  (C)  THE HUMILIATION DOES NOT STOP WITH THE FALL OF 
MOLIRO.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE FOND OF REPEATING THAT 
GOVERNMENT FORCES WERE NOT DEFEATED ON THE BATTLE FIELD, 
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE MANAGED TO LOSE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE 
COUNTY.  THAT IS DUE IN PART TO THE FACT THAT THE CONGOLESE 
ARMED FORCES (FAC) IS BY AND LARGE A RAGTAG ARMY MORE GIVEN 
TO FLIGHT THAN TO FIGHT. ALLIES ZIMBABWE AND ANGOLA SEEM 
LITTLE INCLINED TO GET MORE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN CONGO EXCEPT 
TO PROTECT THEIR OWN INTERESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT REALIZES THAT 
TODAY IT HAS LITTLE TO NO MILITARY OPTION TO EXERCISE, SHOULD 
POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS FAIL. 
 
 
UNDER APPRECIATED 
 
8.  (C)  JOSEPH KABILA IS PUZZLED THAT HIS EFFORTS ARE NOT 
FULLY APPRECIATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  HIS 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS HAVE BEEN MET WITH MILD 
ENCOURAGEMENT, BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN EMBRACED BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE SENSE OF DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO 
THE GOVERNMENT.  THE IMF AND THE WORLD BANK ARE THE MOST 
RESPONSIVE, BUT EVEN THERE HE IS HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY 
MEETING THEIR MINIMAL STANDARDS THAT WILL LEAD TO ASSISTANCE 
IN THE SHORT TERM.  KABILA\'S EFFORTS AT DDRRR HAVE EARNED HIM 
AS MUCH CRITICISM AS THEY HAVE CREDIT.  NO DOUBT IT TOOK 
GREAT EFFORT ON HIS PART TO OVERCOME THE OBJECTIONS OF 
MINISTER OF PUBLIC SECURITY KONGOLO AND OTHERS IN CANTONING 
1,800 (AND NOT THE 3,000 HE FIRST ANNOUNCED) IN KAMINA, BUT 
THE DELAYING TACTICS OF HIS GOVERNMENT AND THE FLIRTING WITH 
THE RWANDAN OPPOSITION GROUP FDLR PRECLUDED A POSITIVE 
REACTION FROM RWANDA.  EVEN HIS PROPOSAL TO THE UN SECURITY 
COUNCIL TO FORM A COMMISSION TO MOVE DDRRR FORWARD AROUSED 
LITTLE INTEREST. 
 
 
POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR THE USG 
 
9.  (C)  THE KABILA GOVERNMENT APPEARS BUFFETED BY EVENTS 
WITH NO COHERENT STRATEGIC VISION OF HOW TO SHAPE THE 
POLITICAL TRANSITION IN CONGO.  KABILA NEEDS AND WANTS USG 
APPROVAL AND ENCOURAGEMENT, ALTHOUGH HE WOULD PREFER THAT 
BOTH TAKE ON MORE CONCRETE FORM IN TERMS OF ASSISTANCE AND 
COOPERATION.  WE THEREFORE HAVE SOME (ALBEIT LIMITED) 
LEVERAGE TO INFLUENCE HIM TO CONTINUE REFORMS AND TO GRAPPLE 
WITH AT LEAST SOME OF THE TOUGH DECISIONS FACING HIM, HELPING 
HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT, WHILE THE ICD MAY NOT BE A VERY 
COMFORTABLE FIT, LIKE CINDERELLA, HE HAS TO SQUEEZE HIS FOOT 
INTO THE DIALOG SHOE IF HE IS GOING TO GET CONGO BACK ON 
TRACK.

MOST INTEREST.  OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THE U.S., FORMER 
ANR CHIEF LETA MANGASA IS CHARGED WITH BEING IN SECRET 
CONTACT WITH THE CIA STATION CHIEF IN KINSHASA BETWEEN JULY 
2000 AND JANUARY 16, 2001, IN ORDER TO \"FAVOR UNDERTAKINGS OF 
THE (U.S.), NOTABLY SUPPORT TO REBEL FORCES AGAINST THE DRC.\" 
 FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS AND DUE PROCESS PERSPECTIVE, THE LDK 
ASSASSINATION TRIAL IS DEEPLY FLAWED.  NEVERTHELESS, THAT THE 
TRIAL IS FINALLY BEGINNING, IS AN IMPROVEMENT ON INDEFINITE 
INCARCERATION.  SEPTEL WILL REPORT DEVELOPMENTS AS THE TRIAL 
PROGRESSES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GENERAL INFO ABOUT THE CHARGES 
------------------------------ 
 
2.    (U)  ON MARCH 20, GENERAL PROSECUTOR COLONEL CHARLES 
ALAMBA MUNGAKO FORMALLY PRESENTED WRITTEN CHARGES AGAINST 116 
SUSPECTS WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED FOR OVER A YEAR IN RELATION 
TO THE ASSASSINATION OF LAURENT DESIRE KABILA,(REPORTED REF 
A).  (NOTE:  THE COURT ANNOUNCED THERE WERE 135 DEFENDANTS, 
BUT HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS AND LAWYERS SAY THE LIST DUPLICATES 
SEVERAL PEOPLE, AND THEY BELIEVE THERE ARE ACTUALLY ONLY 116 
INDIVIDUALS.)  OF THE 116 DEFENDANTS, MOST ARE FROM THE 
MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  AN NGO CONTACT COUNTED 
16 CIVILIANS.  THE TRIAL BEGINS APRIL 3 UNDER THE 
JURISDICTION OF THE MILITARY COURT (COM), WITH GENERAL NAWEL 
MUKONGO AS THE PRESIDING JUDGE (\"PRESIDENT OF THE COURT\"). 
AFTER BEING DETAINED OVER A YEAR WITHOUT ACCESS TO LAWYERS 
(ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALLOWED REGULAR INTERNATIONAL 
COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS VISITS), LAWYERS HAD ONLY TWO 
WEEKS TO PREPARE THEIR CASES. 
 
3.    (U) IN ROUGHLY HALF OF THE CASES, CHARGES WERE MADE ON 
AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; THE REST OF THE DEFENDANTS WERE CHARGED 
IN A GROUP OF 40 AND A GROUP OF 19.  IN GENERAL, THE CHARGES 
WERE QUITE REPETITIVE.  SOME OF THE MOST COMMON WERE: 1) 
ABANDONMENT OF POST (FOR THE BODYGUARDS AND SOLDIERS), 2) 
PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OR FAILURE TO INFORM THE PRESIDENT OF A PLOT 
(ANR/NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FIGURES), 3) FACILITATION 
OF THE ESCAPE OF KEY DEFENDANTS, 4) KILLING OF ASSASSINATION 
SUSPECTS, AND 5) MEMBERSHIP IN THE MASASU GROUP (SEE PARA 5). 
 
SOME OF THE KEY PLAYERS 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (C) AS REPORTED IN REFTELS B AND C, THERE ARE SEVERAL 
THEORIES AS TO THE IDENTITY AND MOTIVATION OF LDK\'S 
ASSASSINATION PLOTTERS.  WITHOUT DELVING INTO THE VERACITY OF 
THESE THEORIES, THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY PLAYERS WHO WILL 
DOMINATE THE FOCUS OF THE TRIALS: 
 
-- RASHIDI\'S FAMILY:  RASHIDI MIZELE ALLEGEDLY KILLED 
PRESIDENT KABILA, AND WAS ALLEGEDLY KILLED BY COLONEL EDDY 
KAPEND.  RASHIDI\'S WIFE, LADY NABINTU, WAS ARRESTED AND HAS 
BEEN IN JAIL WITH HER CHILD (NOW 2 YEARS OLD, SHE HAD A 
SECOND CHILD WHILE IN JAIL) DURING THE PAST YEAR.  SHE IS 
CHARGED AS A MEMBER OF THE MASASU GROUP.  HER LAWYER TOLD 
POLOFF THAT THE 2-YEAR-OLD, AIME, WAS CLUBBED BY GLM SOLDIERS 
AND SUFFERS FROM MENTAL PROBLEMS (HE IS REPORTEDLY 
TRAUMATIZED WHENEVER HE SEES A SOLDIER IN UNIFORM). 
 
-- COLONEL EDDY KAPEND:  KAPEND WAS PRESIDENT KABILA\'S 
PERSONAL BODYGUARD AND AIDE-DE-CAMP.  AFTER ALLEGEDLY KILLING 
RASHIDI, KAPEND WENT ON NATIONAL TV TO URGE THE POPULATION TO 
STAY CALM AND TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE ARMY\'S SENIOR 
LEADERSHIP TO MOVE TROOPS TO SECURE THE AIRPORT, ETC... 
KAPEND\'S ALLEGED KILLING OF RASHIDI RATHER THAN TAKING HIM 
PRISONER, AND HIS \"TAKE-OVER\" BEHAVIOR AFTER LDK\'S DEATH, HAS 
FED THE SPECULATION THAT KAPEND WAS IN COLLUSION WITH 
RASHIDI.  KAPEND IS REPRESENTED BY SEVERAL LAWYERS.  HE IS 
FACES MANY CHARGES, INCLUDING KILLING RASHIDI AND GIVING 
ORDERS TO HIS MILITARY SUPERIORS (REFERENCE TO HIS TV 
APPEARANCES AND OTHER INSTRUCTIONS).  (NOTE: IT IS NOT CLEAR 
IF KAPEND IS CHARGED WITH TREASON BY REASON OF ATTEMPTING A 
COUP.  GIVING ORDERS TO S SUPERIOR IS HARDLY A SERIOUS 
CRIMINAL ACT.) 
 
-- GENERAL YAV NAWEJ:  IN THE CONFUSION IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 
ASSASSINATION, NAWEJ ALLEGEDLY ROUNDED UP AND EXECUTED 11 
LEBANESE SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE PLOT (THE CHARGES 
ALLEGE THAT HE DID THIS ON ORDERS FROM KAPEND).  HE IS 
CHARGED WITH MURDERING THE LEBANESE AND WITH OBEYING ORDERS 
FROM KAPEND, A MORE JUNIOR OFFICER, PERHAPS AS A 
CO-CONSPIRATOR IN KAPEND\'S ATTEMPTED COUP D\'ETAT. 
 
-- MAJOR KAMWANYA BORA, GEORGES MIRINDI, AND JOHN BAHATI: 
MIRINDI AND BAHATI WERE CLOSE ASSOCIATES AND ALLEGED 
CO-CONSPIRATORS OF RASHIDI (SEE REF B).  MAJOR BORA WAS A 
CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF COMMANDANT MASASU.  ALL THREE ESCAPED 
PRISON SOON AFTER THE ASSASSINATION AND ARE SAID TO BE IN 
BELGIUM.  THE TWO WIVES OF MAJOR BORA, MASUMBUKO MWALI ANNE 
MARIE AND KAMUANYA BEYA ROSETTE, HAVE BEEN IN PRISON THIS 
LAST YEAR AND WERE CHARGED WITH FACILITATING THE ESCAPE OF 
BORA BY BRIBING GUARDS.  (NOTE: POLOFF HAS HEARD REPORTS THAT 
MIRINDI\'S AND/OR BAHATI\'S WIVES MAY ALSO IN PRISON, BUT THEY 
ARE NOT DEFENDANTS IN THIS TRIAL.) 
 
-- NELLY TWITE: TWITE WAS PRESIDENT KABILA\'S PRIVATE 
SECRETARY, AND ALLEGEDLY LETA\'S GIRLFRIEND.  SHE IS CHARGED 
WITH FAILING TO INFORM THE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF 
AN ANR REPORT ON THREATS TO HIS SAFETY. 
 
THE MASASU GROUP 
---------------- 
 
5. (C) COMMANDANT ANSELME MASASU WAS CONVICTED OF 
COUP-PLOTTING AGAINST LAURENT KABILA AND EXECUTED ON NOVEMBER 
24, 2000.  BEFORE THEIR FALLING OUT, MASASU WAS A FOUNDER OF 
THE AFDL.  MASASU WAS A MUSHI (SINGULAR - PLURAL FOR THE 
ETHNIC GROUP IS BASHI) FROM SOUTH KIVU.  HE HAD A FOLLOWING 
IN THE ARMY AMONG THE BASHI AND THE \"KADOGOS\" (CHILD 
SOLDIERS) HE RECRUITED FROM SOUTH KIVU.  AFTER HIS DEATH, 
HUNDREDS OF KADOGOS WERE EXECUTED OR ARRESTED, AND IT IS 
COMMONLY THOUGHT THAT LDK\'S ASSASSINATION WAS REVENGE OR 
SIMPLY TO \"FINISH THE JOB\" MASASU ATTEMPTED UNSUCCESSFULLY 
(REF B).  ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT LDK\'S 
ASSASSINS HAD DIFFERENT MOTIVES (REF C) AND LITTLE OR NO 
CONNECTION TO THE MASASU GROUP. 
 
6.  (C) THE DEFENDENTS INCLUDE TWO GROUPS THAT ARE CHARGED 
GENERALLY WITH BEING PART OF THE MASASU GROUP: 1) A \"GROUP OF 
19\" WHO ARE BASHI AND WERE AGENTS OF ANR IN SOUTH KIVU, AND 
2) 39 PERSONS (MOSTLY BASHI OR FROM OTHER SOUTH KIVU ETHNIC 
GROUPS) CHARGED VAGUELY WITH \"CONNECTIONS TO GENERAL MASASU.\" 
 RASHIDI\'S WIDOW, LADY NABINTU, IS CHARGED WITH BEING IN 
GENERAL MASASU\'S GROUP.  (NOTE: SINCE SHE IS MUSHI, THIS IS A 
CONVENIENT CHARGE; THE COURT CANNOT LEGALLY HOLD HER SIMPLY 
BECAUSE SHE WAS MARRIED TO LDK\'S ASSASSIN.) 
 
7.  (C) CURIOUSLY, JOSEPH KABILA ALLEGEDLY MAINTAINS CONTACT 
WITH THE MASASU FAMILY.  POLOFF MET WITH PERE ITOLO, AN 
ITALIAN PRIEST AND LONG-TIME CONTACT OF THE ICRC.  APPARENTLY 
THE MASASU FAMILY HAS BEEN PART OF PERE ITOLO\'S PARISH FOR 
YEARS, AND HE HAS BEEN CARING FOR THEM SINCE COMMANDANT 
MASASU\'S EXECUTION.  ITOLO TOLD POLOFF THAT JOSEPH KABILA AND 
CMDT MASASU FOUGHT IN THE AFDL SIDE-BY-SIDE AND BEEN CLOSE 
COMRADES; JOSEPH KABILA ALSO ALLEGEDLY HAD AN AFFAIR WITH 
MASASU\'S SISTER.   PERE ITOLO GAVE POLOFF A DOCUMENT DATED 
SEPTEMBER 17, 1998, SIGNED BY MAJOR GENERAL JOSEPH KABILA, 
GIVING THE MASASU FAMILY THE RIGHT TO OCCUPY A HOUSE IN 
KINSHASA THAT HAD BEEN SEIZED AS \"BIENS MAL ACQUIS.\" 
ACCORDING TO ITOLO, RELATIONS BETWEEN JOSEPH KABILA AND THE 
MASASU FAMILY CONTINUED EVEN AFTER COMMANDANT MASASU\'S 
EXECUTION.  ON JANUARY 8, 2002, THE MASASU FAMILY RECEIVED A 
LETTER FROM THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR GIVING THEM PERMISSION 
TO LEAVE KINSHASA AND RETURN TO BUKAVU (BY MONUC TRANSPORT). 
ODDLY, THIS LETTER (WHICH WAS DATED OCTOBER 2, 2001) ARRIVED 
TWO DAYS AFTER THE ARREST OF JUSTIN NINDAGA (THE BROTHER OF 
MASASU), WHO IS STILL BEING HELD.  PERE ITOLO SAID THE FAMILY 
WILL NOT LEAVE KINSHASA WITHOUT NINDAGA.  PERE ITOLO SAID 
MASASU\'S MOTHER (CONSOLATE MUKUZO, AGED 51) DIED RECENTLY \"OF 
A BROKEN HEART\" AND THAT JOSEPH KABILA PRIVATELY SENT $300 IN 
CASH TO HELP PAY FOR HER FUNERAL. 
 
LETA - CHARGED WITH CONNECTION TO THE CIA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) IN ANOTHER ODD TWIST, FORMER CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (ANR) LETA MANGASA WAS CHARGED WITH 
VARIOUS CRIMES INVOLVING THE CIA.  THESE CHARGES HAVE SO FAR 
RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE CONGOLESE PRESS.  THE 
SECTIONS OF THE CHARGES RELATING TO THE U.S. ARE QUOTED AS 
FOLLOWS: 
 
LETA MANGASA IS CHARGED WITH ... 
 
-- \"HAVING DIRECTLY CAUSED THE ATTACK COMMITTED AGAINST THE 
LIFE OF THE HEAD OF STATE... NOTABLY BY REFRAINING FROM 
COMMUNICATING TO THE HEAD OF STATE AS PART OF HIS DUTIES... 
THE SYNTHESIS OF THE SECURITY SERVICE MEMOS RELATING TO 
THREATS OF ATTACKS AGAINST HIS LIFE, RECEIVED FROM THE CIA 
CHIEF OF STATION IN CENTRAL AFRICA RESIDING IN THE DRC.\" 
 
-- \"HAVING MAINTAINED INTELLIGENCE WITH A FOREIGN POWER OR 
WITH ITS AGENTS TO FAVOR DEEDS OF THE POWER AGAINST THE DRC. 
IN THIS CASE, IN KINSHASA, ...IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN JULY 2000 
AND JANUARY 16, 2001, WHILE KNOWING THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE AGGRESSION BEFALLING THE DRC, 
MAINTAINED SECRET CONTACTS WITH THE CIA CHIEF OF STATION IN 
CENTRAL AFRICA RESIDING IN KINSHASA TO FAVOR UNDERTAKINGS OF 
THE POWER, NOTABLY SUPPORT TO REBEL FORCES AGAINST THE DRC.\" 
 
HUMAN RIGHTS ASPECTS 
-------------------- 
 
9.  (C) ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, THE TRIAL IS FINALLY GETTING 
UNDER WAY.  IT IS OPEN TO THE PRESS AND OTHER OBSERVERS 
(LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL).  THE DEFENDANTS HAVE ACCESS TO 
LAWYERS AND THE CHARGES HAVE BEEN READ PUBLICLY. 
 
10.  (C) HOWEVER, THE TRIAL IS FRAUGHT WITH DUE PROCESS 
PROBLEMS.  SEVERAL CIVILIANS ARE BEING TRIED IN THE MILITARY 
COURT SYSTEM (COM).  MOST PRISONERS WERE HELD WITHOUT CHARGES 
IN HORRIBLE CONDITIONS AND WITHOUT ACCESS TO LAWYERS FOR OVER 
A YEAR.  THE LAWYERS HAD ONLY TWO WEEKS TO PREPARE THEIR 
CASES.  ONE OF EDDY KAPEND\'S LAWYERS REPORTED THAT 
CONSULTATION OF HER CLIENT\'S FILES MUST TAKE PLACE IN 
MILITARY PRESENCE AND UNDER THEIR CLOSE SCRUTINY.  THE \"GROUP 
CHARGES\" AGAINST THOSE IN THE MASASU GROUP DO NOT AFFORD 
INDIVIDUALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THEMSELVES INNOCENT. 
FINALLY, THERE IS A STRONG BELIEF IN KINSHASA THAT THESE 
DEFENDANTS WILL BE JUDGED BASED ON THEIR ETHNICITY. 
 
11.  (C) POLOFF RECENTLY SPOKE TO MINISTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
NTUMBA LUABA, URGING HIM TO SUPPORT A FAIR TRIAL AND LIVABLE 
CONDITIONS FOR THE PRISONERS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN.  NTUMBA TOLD POLOFF THAT THE WIVES OF KEY FIGURES 
FACE FORMAL CHARGES, SO HE WAS UNABLE TO ADVOCATE RELEASE. 
HE ADMITTED THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY ARE ONLY BEING 
HELD BECAUSE OF THEIR HUSBANDS\' ACTIONS.  HE SAID HE HAD 
PERSONALLY VISITED EACH OF THE FOUR WOMEN AND THAT THEY WERE 
IN LIVABLE CONDITIONS (TWO ARE IN PAVILION 1 AND TWO ARE IN 
THE WOMEN\'S SECTION OF MAKALA PRISON). 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13.  (C) POST WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
LDK ASSASSINATION TRIAL, ESPECIALLY FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS ANGLE 
AND CONCERNING ANY ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE U.S.  POLOF IS 
ATTENDING THE APRIL 3 TRAIL OPENING AND WILL REPORT ON 
DEVELOPMENTS AS THE TRIAL PROGRESSES.

SUBJECT: UPDATE ON LAURENT KABILA ASSASSINATION TRIAL 
 
REF: KINSHASA 793 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF LAURA ENGELBRECHT, REASONS 1.5 B & D 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: THE LAURENT KABILA ASSASSINATION TRIAL BEFORE 
A MILITARY TRIBUNAL BEGAN APRIL 3 IN A PUBLIC COURTROOM. 
CURRENTLY, THE WITNESSES AND SOME DEFENDANTS (SUCH AS EDDY 
KAPEND, FORMER AIDE-DE-CAMP TO KABILA AND ALLEGED 
COUP-PLOTTER) ARE TESTIFYING ON THEIR ROLES IN THE EVENTS 
IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING THE ASSASSINATION.  SEVERAL 
CONTRADICTORY VERSIONS HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH, AND THE COURT 
WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO HEAR TESTIMONY FOR QUITE SOME TIME. 
NOW THAT THE TRIAL HAS STARTED, THERE IS AT LEAST A SEMBLANCE 
OF ORDER AND DUE PROCESS, A WELCOME CHANGE FROM THE LONG 
IMPRISONMENT OF THE ACCUSED WITHOUT CHARGES OR LAWYERS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) POLOFF ATTENDED TWO SESSIONS OF THE ONGOING TRIAL FOR 
THE 116 DEFENDANTS IN THE LDK ASSASSINATION.  THE TRIAL IS 
BEING HELD AT MAKALA CENTRAL PRISON, AND BY PREVAILING LOCAL 
STANDARDS, IT IS QUITE WELL ORGANIZED AND ACCESSIBLE TO THE 
PUBLIC.  THE COURTROOM INCLUDES A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE 
MILITARY JUDGES, A TABLE FACING IT FOR WITNESSES AND LAWYERS, 
A SEATING SECTION FOR THE DEFENDANTS (LOOKS LIKE A JURY BOX), 
AND ROWS OF SEATING FOR THE LAWYERS (OVER 100).  THE PUBLIC 
(MAINLY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OF THE DEFENDANTS) IS SEATED IN 
AN ADJOINING COURTYARD UNDER A SHADE SHELTER.  ALL JUDGES, 
LAWYERS, AND WITNESSES USE MICROPHONES, AND THE TRIAL CAN BE 
CLEARLY HEARD BY ALL.  MANY OF THE OTHER MAKALA PRISONERS 
HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO COME AND WATCH THE TRIAL.  MILITARY AND 
POLICE PRESENCE (INCLUDING ZIMBABWEAN SOLDIERS) IS HEAVY BUT 
NOT MENACING.  THERE IS A RELAXED ATMOSPHERE DURING THE COURT 
RECESSES - EVERYONE (THE LAWYERS, JUDGES, MILITARY, MAKALA 
PRISONERS, AND EVEN THE DEFENDANTS IN THE TRIAL) STAND AROUND 
CHATTING TOGETHER IN THE COURTYARD, WHERE VENDORS HAWK DRINKS 
AND SANDWICHES. 
 
3.  (C) FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DAILY PROGRESSION 
OF THE TRIAL: 
 
APRIL 3: THE COURT CONSIDERED TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND 
OBJECTIONS TO PROCEDURE RAISED BY THE DEFENSE LAWYERS. 
 
APRIL 4-5: THE COURT MOVED IMMEDIATELY TO HEARING TESTIMONY 
ABOUT THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE ASSASSINATION.  SEVERAL 
DEFENDANTS (KAPEND AND THREE MILITARY GUARDS) TESTIFIED, AS 
DID FORMER FINANCE ADVISOR MOTA, WHO WAS WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION.  THEIR VERSIONS OF EVENTS 
DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY.  KAPEND HAS DENIED THAT HE KILLED THE 
ASSASSIN RASHIDI, SAYING RASHIDI COMMITTED SUICIDE AND KAPEND 
EMPTIED HIS GUN INTO HIM \"OUT OF ANGER\" AFTER HE WAS ALREADY 
DEAD.  MOTA CLAIMS HE SAW NO HUMAN BEINGS IN THE COMPOUND 
RIGHT AFTER THE SHOOTING, ONLY A COW.  CHIRIBAGULA, ONE OF 
THE GUARDS, CLAIMS MOTA NOT ONLY SAW HIM, BUT SPOKE TO HIM 
(\"AND I AM NOT A COW\").  MOTA, WHO WAS IN COURT MERELY AS A 
WITNESS, HAS NOW BEEN DETAINED FOR THE DURATION OF THE TRIAL 
ON THE GROUNDS OF SELF-CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY (PROBABLY TO 
PREVENT HIM FROM FLEEING).  (NOTE: MOTA\'S COW STORY MAY HAVE 
BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO IMPLY THAT THERE WAS SORCERY INVOLVED, AS 
SOME CONGOLESE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE CAN TURN THEMSELVES INTO 
ANIMALS THROUGH MAGIC.) 
 
APRIL 8: THE COURT MOVED TEMPORARILY TO THE PALAIS DE MARBRE, 
THE SITE OF THE ASSASSINATION, TO ALLOW THE WITNESSES TO 
REENACT THE EVENTS. 
 
APRIL 9-10: MORE TESTIMONY WAS HEARD.  THE DRIVER OF GEORGES 
MIRINDI (AN ALLEGED CONSPIRATOR IN THE PLOT) TESTIFIED THAT 
ON THE DAY BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION, HE WARNED LAURENT 
KABILA\'S DRIVER OF THE PLOT AND TOLD KABILA\'S DRIVER TO 
INFORM THE HIERARCHY.  KABILA\'S DRIVER TESTIFIED THAT HE 
INFORMED THE SECURITY SERVICES.  THE TWO SECURITY SERVICES 
OFFICERS SAID THEY HAD HAD NO TRANSPORTATION TO GO ARREST 
MIRINDI.  THEIR BOSS TESTIFIED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN TOLD. 
 
APRIL 11: GAETAN KAKUDJI, LAURENT KABILA\'S FORMER MINISTER OF 
INTERIOR AND CLOSE ADVISOR, TESTIFIED ABOUT HIS AND OTHER 
SENIOR ADVISORS\' (INCLUDING MWENZE KONGOLO) ACTIONS 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SHOOTING.  HE TALKED ABOUT A MEETING TO 
DISCUSS PLACING JOSEPH KABILA IN THE PRESIDENCY TO KEEP 
THINGS STABLE, AND HE STRESSED THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO CARRY 
OUT LDK\'S WISHES.  HE CONTRADICTED AND CORRECTED HIMSELF ON 
OCCASION DURING HIS TESTIMONY, AND HIS ATTEMPTS AT HUMOR 
BORDERED AT TIMES ON IMPUDENCE IN ADDRESSING THE JUDGE. 
 
4.  (C)  EVEN BEFORE THE TRIAL BEGAN, IT HAD SEVERE DUE 
PROCESS PROBLEMS, SUCH AS THE YEAR-LONG JAILING OF DEFENDANTS 
WITHOUT LAWYERS OR CHARGES, THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME GIVEN TO 
PREPARE THE DEFENSE, THE TRIAL OF SO MANY DEFENDANTS ON 
WIDELY VARYING CHARGES IN A SINGLE TRIAL, AND THE TRIAL OF 
CIVILIANS IN A MILITARY COURT.  NEVERTHELESS, NOW THAT IT HAS 
BEGUN, THE TRIAL SEEMS TO BE PROCEEDING MORE-OR-LESS SMOOTHLY 
AND OPENLY, WITH BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE HAVING 
ADEQUATE TIME TO CROSS-EXAMINE THE WITNESSES.  MANY ASPECTS 
OF THE PROCEDURE LOOK STRANGE TO U.S. OBSERVORS (SUCH AS 
REQUIRING DEFENDANTS TO TESTIFY, THE ORDER OF WITNESSES, 
ETC...), BUT THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DRC 
MILITARY COURT (COM) CODE IS BASED ON THE 1960\'S BELGIAN 
PENAL CODE AND IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM TRIAL FORMAT USED IN 
U.S. CIVILIAN COURTS. 
 
5.  (C) BOTH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS 
(ICRC) AND THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW GROUP HAVE 
MONITORS IN REGULAR ATTENDANCE AT THE TRIAL.  EACH DAY\'S 
PROCEEDINGS ARE ALSO COVERED EXTENSIVELY IN THE LOCAL PRESS 
AND, AS DEVELOPMENTS WARRANT, BY INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS.

BIAS, A MULTIPLICITY OF PROCEDURAL ERRORS AND LACK OF

---------------- 
THE KABILA TRIAL 
---------------- 
 
2.   (C) THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL FOR THE SUSPECTS IN THE 
ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PRESIDENT KABILA, WHICH WAS CLOSED TO 
THE PUBLIC MAY 2 ON THE GROUNDS OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 
REOPENED AUGUST 27 ACCORDING TO OBSERVERS FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW GROUP.  POLOFF WAS ADMITTED TO 
THE HEARING ROOM ON SEPTEMBER 17; HOWEVER, THE COURT RECESSED 
IMMEDIATELY DUE TO THE ILLNESS OF ONE OF THE JUDGES.  DOZENS 
OF ATTORNEYS WHO HAD MADE A POINTLESS TRIP TO MAKALA PRISON 
WERE HEARD TO BE MUTTERING IN ANNOYANCE.  PROCEEDINGS ARE NOW 
SCHEDULED TO RESUME SEPTEMBER 24 AT WHICH POINT CLOSING 
ARGUMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN. IN SPITE OF THE PRESENCE OF 
TELEVISION CAMERAS IN THE COURT, THE PRESS HAS FAILED TO 
COVER THE REOPENED PROCEEDINGS.  A LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP, 
LA VOIX DES SANS VOIX (VSV) WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN OF THE 
REOPENING. 
 
3.    (C) THE LAW GROUP OBSERVERS WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED 
BY TWO ISSUES.  THE FIRST IS A LACK OF LEGAL COUNSEL FOR MANY 
OF THE PRISONERS.  ALTHOUGH ALL THE PRISONERS TECHNICALLY 
HAVE COUNSEL, SOME LAWYERS ARE FAILING TO SHOW UP IN COURT 
EVEN WHEN THEIR CLIENTS ARE BEING QUESTIONED.  SECOND, THE 
OBSERVERS NOTE THE OBVIOUS PRO-GOVERNMENT BIAS OF THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE MILITARY COURT, GENERAL NAWEL MUKONGO, WHO 
KEEPS A TIGHT REIN ON DEFENDANTS AND THEIR LEGAL 
REPRESENTATIVES BUT ALLOWS THE PROSECUTOR, COLONEL CHARLES 
ALAMBA, TO MAKE SPEECHES AND ACCUSATIONS WITH LITTLE OR NO 
FOUNDATION.  MEMBERS OF VSV ALSO COMPLAINED THAT HE HAD 
OVERLOOKED PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES SUCH AS THE LOSS OF THE 
WEAPON USED TO KILL KABILA AND DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE 
AUTOPSY AND OTHER INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS.  THIS IS NAWEL\'S 
FIRST APPOINTMENT AS JUDGE.  HE WAS FORMERLY A PROSECUTOR 
HIMSELF. 
 
4.    (C) CASES ARE PRESENTLY BEING BROUGHT AGAINST 118 
SUSPECTS.  A HANDFUL WERE NEVER CAPTURED, BUT ROUGHLY A 
HUNDRED ARE BEING HELD AT PAVILION ONE IN MAKALA PRISON. 
THEY ARE ONLY ALLOWED VISITS FROM THEIR ATTORNEYS AND BRIEF 
CONTACT WITH FAMILY OR FRIENDS WHO BRING THEM FOOD.  THE LAW 
GROUP EXPECTS THAT A VERDICT MAY BE HANDED DOWN BY THE END OF 
THE MONTH.  AT PRESENT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF APPEAL; 
HOWEVER, THE LAW GROUP NOTES THERE WAS TALK OF INSTITUTING AN 
APPEAL PROCESS. 
 
------------------------- 
DETENTION OF N\'SII LUANDA 
------------------------- 
 
5.    (C) AS REPORTED REFTEL C, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST N\'SII 
LUANDA, HEAD OF A LOCAL NGO, THE COMMITTEE FOR THE 
OBSERVATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS (CODHO) WAS ARRESTED APRIL 19. 
HE HAS BEEN HELD SINCE THEN ACCUSED OF TREASON AND HARBORING 
CRIMINALS APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH A 
FORMER POLITICAL DETAINEE, MICHEL BISIMWA.  ACCORDING TO THE 
LAW GROUP, N\'SII HAS ACCESS TO THREE LAWYERS BUT THEY HAVE 
NOT BEEN PERMITTED TO ACCOMPANY HIM WHEN HE IS INTERROGATED. 
HE STILL HAS NOT BEEN FORMALLY CHARGED.  HE IS INCARCERATED 
IN PAVILION 8 OF MAKALA PRISON WHICH IS SOMEWHAT MORE OPEN TO 
VISITS FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAN PAVILION ONE WHICH HOUSES 
THE KABILA ASSASSINATION SUSPECTS.  NEVERTHELESS THERE HAS 
BEEN SOME CONCERN ABOUT HIS HEALTH.  HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH, 
WHICH ISSUED A STATEMENT SEPT. 11 CALLING ON PRESIDENT JOSEPH 
KABILA TO RELEASE N\'SII, CLAIMED THAT HE IS SUFFERING FROM 
MALARIA.  LAW GROUP REPRESENTATIVES DID NOT BELIEVE THAT 
N\'SII\'S CONDITION WAS SERIOUS. 
 
------------------------------ 
HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP OVERWHELMED 
------------------------------ 
 
6.     (C) MEMBERS OF THE VOIX DES SANS VOIX INTERVIEWED BY 
POLOFF SEPT.17 DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AS OVERWHELMED WITH 
CASES.  THEY WERE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED WITH A NUMBER OF 
ARRESTS MADE IN KINSHASA IN APRIL AND MAY 2001 AND AGAIN IN 
JULY AND AUGUST OF THIS YEAR OF NATIVES OF THE EQUATEUR 
REGION.  VSV HAS SINCE ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE IDENTIFYING 
SEVEN PEOPLE, MEMBERS OF OR WITH TIES TO THE FAZ 
(EX-PRESIDENT MOBUTU\'S ARMED FORCES), WHO ARE BEING HELD ON 
SUSPICION OF CONCEALING ARMS   THE HEAD OF VSV, FLORIBERT 
CHEBAYA, TOLD POLOFF OF HIS DISAPPOINTMENT WITH PRESIDENT 
JOSEPH KABILA WHO HAS FAILED TO LIVE UP TO HIS PLEDGES UPON 
COMING TO POWER.  SECURITY FORCES OPERATE WITH IMPUNITY.  HE 
WAS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL OF ALAMBA, PROSECUTOR IN THE KABILA 
TRIAL, WHOM HE ACCUSED OF TAKING PRISONERS SO THAT HE CAN 
CLAIM THE PROPERTY OF HIS VICTIMS.  HE HAD EVEN THREATENED TO 
USE WEAPONS TO DETER NGOS FROM ORGANIZING A SIT-IN TO DEMAND 
THE RELEASE OF N\'SII LUANDA AND ANOTHER ACTIVIST WILLY WENGA. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.    (C) ALTHOUGH THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN THE DRC HAS 
IMPROVED IN MANY RESPECTS OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS, THE 
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THOSE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD IT HAVE A 
LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THEY CAN BE CONSIDERED EVEN MARGINALLY 
RELIABLE OR ACCOUNTABLE.  THE KABILA TRIAL IN PARTICULAR WITH 
ITS ECCENTRIC PROCEEDINGS, MULTIPLE AND EVER GROWING NUMBER 
OF ACCUSED, BIASED RULINGS AND BIZARRE LAPSES LEADS ONE TO 
SPECULATE THAT KAFKA MIGHT REALLY HAVE BEEN CONGOLESE.

-- WAS RULED \"EXTINCTION BY PUBLIC ACTION.\" 
 
2.  (U) LAURENT KABILA\'S ECONOMIC ADVISOR M. MOTA, WHO WAS 
THE ONLY DIRECT WITNESS TO THE ASSASSINATION AND WHO WAS 
ARRESTED DURING THE TRIAL FOR GIVING CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY, 
REMAINS UNDER CONTINUING INVESTIGATION. 
 
3.  (U) AMONG THOSE CONDEMNED TO DEATH ARE COLONEL EDDY 
KAPEND, LAURENT KABILA\'S AIDE-DE-CAMP; GENERAL YAV NAWEJ, 
FORMER GENERAL IN CHARGE OF ARMY FORCES IN KINSHASA; GEORGES 
LETA, FORMER HEAD OF THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY; AND 6 
OTHER PRIMARY SUSPECTS WHO FLED THE COUNTRY IN 2000 AND WERE 
TRIED AND SENTENCED IN ABSENTIA.  AMONG THOSE ACQUITTED WERE 
THE WIVES OF SUSPECTS WHO HAD FLED THE COUNTRY; THEY HAD BEEN 
CHARGED WITH FACILITATING THEIR HUSBANDS\' ESCAPE FROM PRISON. 
 (SEE REF A FOR A SUMMARY OF KEY PLAYERS IN THE TRIAL.) 
 
4.  (C) WHILE THE VERDICT ADDRESSED THE SPECIFIC CHARGES 
AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS, IT DID NOT GIVE A \"FINAL\" VERSION OF 
EVENTS IN THE ASSASSINATION.  THE COURT ANNOUNCED THAT, 
DESPITE THE HANDING DOWN OF 130 VERDICTS, AN OFFICIAL 
INVESTIGATION WOULD CONTINUE TO \"CLARIFY AREAS THAT REMAIN 
SHADOWED\" IN THE ASSASSINATION.  IN THE VERDICT, THERE WAS NO 
MENTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY OTHER WESTERN COUNTRY AS 
BEING COMPLICIT IN THE ASSASSINATION, AN ISSUE OF SOME 
CONCERN AT THE START OF THE TRIAL. 
 
5.  (U) THE MILITARY COURT HAS NO APPEALS PROCESS; HOWEVER, 
BEFORE THE DEATH SENTENCES CAN BE CARRIED OUT, PRESIDENT 
KABILA MUST GIVE PERSONAL APPROVAL.  ALL OF THE LOCAL PAPERS 
-- INCLUDING PRO-OPPOSITION TITLES -- COVERED THE VERDICT 
EXTENSIVELY, AND MOST EDITORIALS APPROVED OF THE RESULTS, 
CALLING IT \"BALANCED\" AND EVIDENCE THAT THE COURT WORK 
INDEPENDENTLY (SINCE THE PROSECUTOR CALLED FOR 115 DEATH 
SENTENCES AND ONLY 30 WERE HANDED OUT).  HARDLINE 
PRO-GOVERNMENT \'L\'AVENIR\' WAS CRITICAL OF THE VERDICT FOR 
FAILING TO ADDRESS WHAT IT TERMED THE \"INTERNATIONAL PLOT\" 
THAT LED TO LAURENT KABILA\'S DEATH.  THIS SAME EDITORIAL 
PREDICTED  THAT INTERNATIONAL NGOS WILL LIKELY ASK FOR 
CLEMENCY FOR THOSE CONDEMNED TO DEATH, SHOWING THAT THEY 
DON\'T UNDERSTAND THAT KILLING A HEAD OF STATE IS SUCH A 
SERIOUS CRIME THAT IT DEMANDS DEATH.  SO FAR, INTERNATIONAL 
NGOS SUCH AS ICRC AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW GROUP HAVE NOT MADE 
STATEMENTS ON THE TRIAL; THEY ARE EXAMINING THE VERDICT TO 
ASSESS THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE SENTENCES IN EACH CATEGORY 
AND ARE LIKELY TO URGE PRESIDENT KABILA TO SUSPEND THE DEATH 
SENTENCES. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE TRIAL STAGE IN THE DRAMA OF THE LAURENT 
KABILA ASSASSINATION HAS BEEN CONCLUDED, ALTHOUGH MANY 
QUESTIONS REMAIN AND THE COURT HAS ORDERED A CONTINUED 
INVESTIGATION INTO KABILA\'S DEATH.  ALL EYES ARE NOW ON 
JOSEPH KABILA CONCERNING THE DEATH PENALTIES -- WILL HE 
SUSPEND THEM OR ALLOW THE EXECUTIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT? 
INTERNATIONAL NGOS AND THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY IN COUNTRIES 
OPPOSED TO THE DEATH PENALTY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY PLACE PRESSURE 
ON KABILA TO SUSPEND THE SENTENCES.  HOWEVER, THERE IS AT 
LEAST SOME POPULAR PRESSURE AMONG THE CONGOLESE TO CARRY THEM 
OUT, PARTLY TO PROVE THAT HE IS \"TOUGH\" AND TAKES THE 
ASSASSINATION OF HIS FATHER SERIOUSLY.  SINCE INHERITING THE 
PRESIDENCY, JOSEPH KABILA HAS SUSPENDED ALL DEATH SENTENCES 
PRONOUNCED BY THE MILITARY OR CIVILIAN COURTS.  HE HAS GIVEN 
NO INDICATION HOW HE WILL PROCEED WITH THIS POLITICAL HOT 
POTATO INVOLVING THOSE FOUND GUILTY IN HIS OWN FATHER\'S DEATH.

CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF EDWARD BESTIC FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  IN RECENT WEEKS GDRC PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA 
HAS APPROVED SEVERAL ACTIONS WHICH ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF A 
SLOW-BUILDING EVOLUTION TOWARDS HARDLINE POLICIES.  \"HAWKISH\" 
ADVISERS SUCH AS AUGUSTIN KATUMBA, SAMBA KAPUTO AND EVARISTE 
BOSHAB HAVE GAINED THE ASCENDANCY OVER MORE \"MODERATE\" 
FIGURES SUCH AS VITAL KAMERHE, ANDRE KAPANGA AND THEOPHILE 
MBEMBA.  KABILA HIMSELF IS NOT AN INNOCENT VICTIM IN THIS 
STORY.  HE HAS NOW SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH A NEW BREED OF 
HARDLINERS--NOT HIS FATHER\'S CRONIES, BUT A YOUNGER, MORE 
SOPHISTICATED GROUP OF HAWKS.  IN THE PAST, KABILA APPEARED 
TO SHOW GREATER APPRECIATION FOR THE LONGER-TERM CONSEQUENCES 
OF HIS CHOICES, IN PARTICULAR THE REACTION OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THESE DAYS, HE IS TAKING HIS 
ADVISERS\' ADVICE SEEMINGLY WITH LESS REGARD FOR THEIR BROADER 
IMPACT, AND APPEARS TO BE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO STAY IN 
POWER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
INCREASING HARDLINE TENDENCIES 
------------------------------ 
2. (C) OVER THE PAST YEAR, THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS THAT KABILA 
HAS INCREASINGLY BEEN FAVORING THE VIEWS SHARED BY THE 
\"HAWKS\" AROUND HIM.  IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS ALONE, THE GDRC 
HAS TAKEN SEVERAL ACTIONS IN LINE WITH THIS MODE OF THINKING. 
 EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE ATTEMPT TO EXPEL CONGOLESE LIBERATION 
MOVEMENT (MLC) REPRESENTATIVES FROM KINSHASA IN JANUARY (REF 
B), THE FIRING OF THE FINANCE MINISTER MATANGULU IN FEBRUARY 
(REF C), AND, SINCE LATE 2002, THE DEPLOYMENT OF REGULAR GDRC 
TROOPS TO THE BENI-BUTEMBO REGION--PUTTING THEM BEYOND THE 
LUSAKA CEASEFIRE LINES. 
 
3. (C) IN GENERAL, HARDLINERS TEND TO ESPOUSE THE BELIEF THAT 
TIME IS ON KINSHASA\'S SIDE IN THE REUNIFICATION PROCESS, THAT 
THE OPPOSING BELLIGERENTS CAN BE OUTMANEUVERED, OUTLASTED, 
AND PERHAPS EVENTUALLY DEFEATED MILITARILY.  INTERNATIONAL 
PRESSURE CAN BE FENDED OFF BY SIGNING AGREEMENTS IN SUN CITY 
AND PRETORIA, BUT ENOUGH OUTSTANDING DISPUTES (SUCH AS OVER 
SECURITY) REMAIN THAT KINSHASA CAN MANIPULATE WITHOUT 
APPEARING TO BE THE HOLDOUT.  IN KEEPING WITH LONGTIME 
CONGOLESE POLITICAL NORMS AND PRACTICES, THESE ADVISERS ARE 
DOUBTLESS MOTIVATED IN NO SMALL PART BY A DESIRE TO KEEP 
THEIR JOBS AND THEIR ACCESS TO WEALTH AND POWER.  DESPITE 
NATIONALIST RHETORIC--MODERATES ARE DENOUNCED AS 
\"TRAITORS\"--SOME MAY IN FACT PREFER TO RULE UNCHALLENGED IN 
PART OF THE COUNTRY RATHER THAN SHARE POWER WITH OTHERS IN A 
NEW NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 
 
WHO HAS KABILA\'S EAR? 
--------------------- 
4. (C) OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, KABILA HAS REPLACED A GREAT 
MANY OF THE \"OLD GUARD\" OF ADVISORS AND MINISTERS APPOINTED 
BY HIS FATHER.  ONCE-POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS MWENZE 
KONGOLO, GAETAN KAKUDJI AND ABDOULAYE YERODIA HAVE LARGELY 
BEEN SIDELINED.  (YERODIA OCCASIONALLY RESURFACES TO SUPPORT 
THE GOVERNMENT IN HIS BAS-CONGO HOME REGION, AND HAS RECENTLY 
BEEN RUMORED--VERY SPECULATIVELY--AS A POSSIBLE GDRC VICE 
PRESIDENT.) 
 
5. (C) AMONG THE NEWER BREED, THE MOST INFLUENTIAL \"HAWKS\" 
APPEAR TO BE ON KABILA\'S OWN PERSONAL STAFF: CABINET DIRECTOR 
EVARISTE BOSHAB, DEPUTY CABINET DIRECTOR SAMBA KAPUTO, AND 
PIERRE LUMBI, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC STUDIES.  PRESIDENTIAL 
SPOKESMAN MULEGWA ZIHINDULA, IN A 23 FEB. PRIVATE MEETING 
WITH THE AMBASSADOR, LEVELED CHARGES OF CORRUPTION AT ALL 
THREE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. 
 
--BOSHAB IS FROM KASAI, A LAW PROFESSOR BY TRAINING AND 
BACKGROUND, WHO HAD BEEN DEPUTY CABINET DIRECTOR UNTIL THE 
OCTOBER 2002 SHUFFLE. 
 
--KAPUTO, WHO IS PERHAPS MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN BOSHAB ON 
POLICY MATTERS, WAS BORN IN KATANGA BUT RAISED IN THE KIVUS, 
AND IS A POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR BY TRAINING.  GOVERNOR 
OF BANDUNDU AND ORIENTALE PROVINCES IN THE MOBUTU ERA, HE WAS 
VITAL KAMERHE\'S DEPUTY AT THE GREAT LAKES PEACE COMMISSION 
UNTIL OCTOBER 2002, WHEN HE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD IN HIS CURRENT 
CAPACITY.  HE IS CONSIDERED THE PROTEGE OF AUGUSTIN KATUMBA. 
 
--LUMBI, FROM MANIEMA, WAS AN UNOFFICIAL ADVISER PRIOR TO 
OCTOBER 2002.  AN EARLY CIVIL SOCIETY LEADER (HE FOUNDED A 
SELF-HELP NGO IN 1978 WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS WERE STILL 
TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL), HE BECAME ETIENNE TSHISEKEDI\'S FOREIGN 
MINISTER IN 1992-3 AND THEN POST & COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER IN 
THE KENGO WA DONDO GOVERNMENT. 
 
6. (C) PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THESE FORMAL ADVISERS IS 
AUGUSTIN KATUMBA, WHO WAS MINISTER OF THE PRESIDENCY UNTIL HE 
WAS SUSPENDED IN OCTOBER 2002 (FOLLOWING THE RELEASE OF THE 
UN PANEL REPORT ON PLUNDERING THE DRC\'S RESOURCES).  KATUMBA, 
LONG CONSIDERED KABILA\'S RIGHT-HAND MAN, HAS BEEN ACTIVELY 
INVOLVED IN ALL INTER-CONGOLESE DIALOGUE NEGOTIATIONS SINCE 
SUN CITY.  THIS HAS ENABLED HIM TO TRANSLATE THE HARDLINE 
VIEW INTO THE GDRC\'S NEGOTIATING POSITIONS AT THE VARIOUS 
ROUNDS OF TALKS.  CURRENT RUMOR HAS IT THAT HE MAY REPLACE 
JEAN MBUYU AS KABILA\'S SPECIAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND CHIEF OF 
THE COMMITTEE FOR STATE SECURITY. 
 
7. (C) REGARDING MILITARY MATTERS, HERETOFORE KABILA HAS 
LISTENED TO ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF, LIEUTENANT GENERAL 
LIWANGA MATA, AN EX-FAZ OFFICER.  HOWEVER, HE ALSO LISTENS TO 
ARMY COMMANDER GENERAL FRANCOIS OLENGA AND AIR FORCE 
COMMANDER GENERAL JOHN NUMBI.  OLENGA AND NUMBI ARE SIMILAR 
IN THAT THEY ARE BOTH POLITICAL APPOINTEES WITH NO 
PROFESSIONAL MILITARY BACKGROUND, HAVE VIOLENT STREAKS, AND 
ARE REPUTED TO BE CORRUPT.  THE TWO ARE RIVALS, EACH VYING 
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL ABROAD ON ARMS-BUYING TRIPS, 
WHICH ENABLES THEM TO SKIM OFF A PERCENTAGE OF ANY SALES 
TRANSACTION.  THEY STAND TO LOSE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AND 
PERHAPS EVEN THEIR JOBS IF THE VARIOUS BELLIGERENTS\' ARMIES 
ARE MERGED. 
 
8. (C) IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY, AS NOTED 
EARLIER THE FIRING OF FINANCE MINISTER MATANGULU SENT 
SHUDDERS THROUGH THE DONOR COMMUNITY.  UNTIL RECENTLY, 
MATANGULU HAD SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE OVER KABILA THAT ENABLED 
THE FORMER TO \"HOLD THE LINE\" ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURES.  HIS 
OUSTER--OVER THE ISSUE OF MAINTAINING FISCAL DISCIPLINE--HAS 
RAISED SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GDRC\'S INTENT TO ADHERE TO 
IFI-APPROVED ECONOMIC POLICIES.  IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THERE 
IS ANYONE LEFT AMONG KABILA\'S CLOSE ADVISERS WHO IS PREPARED 
TO CARRY ON MATANGULU\'S ROLE AND PROVIDE SOUND, IF UNPOPULAR, 
ADVICE ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MATTERS.  JEAN-CLAUDE 
MASANGU AS CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR IS STILL MAINTAINING A 
STABLE MONETARY POLICY, HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN FREQUENT 
RUMORS THAT HE HIMSELF IS LESS THAN SQUEAKY CLEAN. 
 
 
MODERATES, TAKING A BACK SEAT 
----------------------------- 
9. (C) THOSE WHO PUBLICLY EXPRESS A MORE \"MODERATE\" VIEW 
APPEAR TO HAVE WANING INFLUENCE.  SUCH FIGURES INCLUDE: 
 
--THEOPHILE MBEMBA, CABINET DIRECTOR UNTIL OCTOBER 2002, 
SINCE THEN INTERIOR MINISTER, LED THE GDRC DELEGATION AT THE 
PRETORIA NEGOTIATIONS IN DECEMBER, BUT HAS NOT PLAYED A 
VISIBLE ROLE IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS SINCE. 
 
--ANDRE KAPANGA, FORMERLY LAURENT KABILA\'S PERMREP AT THE UN 
IN NEW YORK, CURRENTLY KABILA\'S POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC 
ADVISER, HAS NOT TAKEN CHARGE OF HIS NEW BRIEF AND ALREADY 
HAS BEEN MARGINALIZED;  HE WAS ILL-INFORMED ABOUT KEY 
DECISIONS SUCH AS THE ABORTIVE MLC EXPULSION ORDER. 
 
--VITAL KAMERHE, LONGTIME CHIEF NEGOTIATORS IN THE INTERNAL 
AND EXTERNAL PEACE PROCESSES, NOW PLAYS SECOND FIDDLE TO 
SAMBA KAPUTO IN THESE TALKS. 
 
--MULEGWA ZIHINDULA, PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN SINCE OCTOBER 
2002, CLAIMS TO BE EAGER TO SEE REFORM BUT HAS NOT 
DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON KABILA\'S DECISIONS. 
 
--LEONARD SHE OKITUNDU, FOREIGN MINISTER SINCE LAURENT 
KABILA\'S TIME, CURRENTLY HAS VIRTUALLY NO SAY IN IMPORTANT 
MATTERS.  HIS STAFF HAS COMPLAINED TO EMBOFFS SEVERAL TIMES 
IN RECENT MONTHS ABOUT BEING MARGINALIZED. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
10. (C)  OVER THE PAST YEAR, THERE HAS BEEN A SLOW BUT 
SIGNIFICANT EVOLUTION TOWARDS HARDLINE POLICIES ON THE PART 
OF THE GDRC.  KABILA HIMSELF IS NOT AN INNOCENT VICTIM IN 
THIS STORY, HAVING APPOINTED THE VERY ADVISORS TO WHOM HE IS 
CURRENTLY LISTENING.  HE HAS NOW SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH A 
NEW BREED OF HARDLINERS--NOT HIS FATHER\'S CRONIES, BUT A 
YOUNGER, MORE SOPHISTICATED GROUP OF HAWKS.  IN THE PAST, 
KABILA APPEARED TO SHOW GREATER APPRECIATION FOR THE 
LONGER-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF HIS CHOICES, IN PARTICULAR THE 
REACTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THESE DAYS, HE IS 
TAKING HIS ADVISERS\' ADVICE SEEMINGLY WITH LESS REGARD FOR 
THEIR BROADER IMPACT, AND APPEARS TO BE MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE 
TO STAY IN POWER. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: KATUMBA STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS 
 
REF: KINSHASA 477 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  On 25 July, GDRC President Joseph Kabila 
named eminence grise Augustin Katumba Mwanke 
Secretary-General of the DRC\'s transitional government. 
Kabila officially suspended Katumba in October 2002 following 
publication of the UN panel report on illegal exploitation of 
the DRC\'s wealth; however, Katumba\'s influence continued 
unabated.  The role of the Secretary-General is unclear, and 
will doubtless be a subject of debate between ex-rebel 
movements and members of Kabila\'s camp.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
A Suspension in Name Only 
------------------------- 
2. (C) On 25 July, GDRC President Joseph Kabila named 
Augustin Katumba Mwanke as Secretary-General of the 
transitional government.  Considered a hardliner, Katumba is 
a longtime Kabila associate and former governor of Katanga 
province.  He served as Minister of the Presidency until 
October 2002, when Kabila suspended him and several other 
members of the GDRC\'s ruling elite who were cited in a report 
by the U.N. Panel on Illegal Exploitation of Natural 
Resources and Other Forms of Wealth. 
 
3. (C) Despite the suspension, Katumba continued to play a 
major role, exerting influence personally as well as through 
allies such as Guillaume Samba Kaputo, Kabila\'s deputy chief 
of staff.  He was intimately involved with the 
Inter-Congolese Dialogue political negotiations until their 
conclusion in December 2002 and has a hand in the ongoing 
negotiations on military-security integration.  In the months 
leading up to the formation of the DRC\'s transitional 
government, it was rumored that he was bucking to replace 
Jean Mbuyu as Kabila\'s Special Adviser on security matters. 
 
 
What Responsibilities? 
---------------------- 
4. (C) The transitional constitution is azy on the 
Secretary-General\'s role and responsibilities.  It merely 
says that he \"...assists the resident and Vice-Presidents in 
coordinating govrnmental action\" by \"preparing meetings, 
works ad all dossiers requiring the concerted attention o 
the President and Vice-Presidents and at the cabinet level.\" 
(Note:  Informal poloff translation. End note.)  According 
to Kabila\'s 25 July decre, four Executive Secretaries will 
assist Katumba one per vice-presidential \"commission.\"  The 
for are: 
 
--Political, Defense and Security Commission - Shadrac 
Baitsura Musowa of the RCD-Goma.  H is a Nande from South 
Kivu, has a background inintelligence work, reportedly an 
associate of Biima Karaha. 
 
--Economic and Financial Commission- Tshimanga Mwadi of the 
MLC.  (Details unknown.) 
 
--Reconstruction and Development Commission - Jlien Bukasa 
Kashama of the Kinshasa government. A Luba from Eastern 
Kasai, former career civil srvant in Ministry of Finance and 
Budget. 
 
--Soial and Cultural Commission - Egide Ngokoso of the 
political opposition.  From Bandundu, a leader inAndre 
Boboliko\'s PDSC political party. 
 
 
Reacton to Katumba\'s Return 
--------------------------- 
5. (C) RCD-Goma official Jean-Marie Emungu wa circumspect in 
a 28 July telcon with poloff, sayng only that the RCD-Goma 
had \"taken note\" of the announcement.  MLC official Thomas 
Luhaka told poloff on 29 July that it is better to have 
Katumba in an official position, where he will face public 
scrutiny.  The Secretary-General\'s role should be strictly 
administrative; however, undoubtedly Katumba and his allies 
will seek to expand it. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (C) Having Katumba down amongst the vice-presidents will 
help Kabila maintain his image of being above the fray, and 
at the same time answers the question of where Katumba will 
fit into the new system.  There will likely be a struggle 
over his exact role, with VP\'s Azarias Ruberwa of the 
RCD-Goma and Jean-Pierre Bemba of the MLC seeking to limit 
Katumba\'s powers.  The International Committee to Support the 
Transition (CIAT) may be drawn into the debate, as CIAT 
members will need to decide whether they will want to deal 
with the transitional government through Katumba or interact 
directly with the four vice-presidents.  END COMMENT.

CLASSIFIED BY: POLOFF EDWARD BESTIC FOR REASONS 1.5 B AND D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  AFTER AN INITIAL BURST OF ACTIVITY, THE 
DRC\'S TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS LOST MOMENTUM TOWARDS 
REUNIFYING THE COUNTRY.  PRESIDENT KABILA IN PARTICULAR HAS 
FAILED TO ENERGIZE HIS CUMBERSOME GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE, BUT 
PARLIAMENT AND MINISTERS HAVE LIKEWISE FAILED THE LEADERSHIP 
CHALLENGE.  FAILING TO BREAK THE LEADERSHIP LOGJAM COULD 
RESULT IN AN INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED SOLDIERY AND POPULACE, 
AND POSTPONED NATIONAL ELECTIONS.  POST, IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
OTHER KEY DIPLOMATIC ACTORS, IS WORKING TO JUMP-START JOSEPH 
KABILA AND HIS STALLING TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
STUCK AT FIRST BASE 
------------------- 
2. (C) AFTER AN INITIAL BURST OF ACTIVITY--SWEARING-IN OF THE 
NEW GOVERNMENT IN JULY, INAUGURATION OF PARLIAMENT IN AUGUST, 
CREATION OF AN INTEGRATED MILITARY COMMAND STRUCTURE IN 
SEPTEMBER, AND APPOINTMENT OF MILITARY REGION COMMANDERS IN 
OCTOBER--THE DRC\'S TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS SETTLED INTO A 
LAZY PATTERN OF DRIFT AND NEGLECT.  THE COUNTRY IS STILL 
DIVIDED IN FACT, WITH EACH OF THE FORMER WARRING FACTIONS 
STILL EFFECTIVELY IN CONTROL OF \"ITS\" TERRITORY.  THERE HAS 
BEEN VIRTUALLY NO ORGANIZED PROGRESS ON DEMOBILIZATION OF 
FORMER COMBATANTS OR UNIFICATION OF THE VARIOUS ARMIES.  THE 
POLICE, INTELLIGENCE, IMMIGRATION, TERRITORIAL 
ADMINISTRATION, DIPLOMATIC SERVICES AND STATE-OWNED 
ENTERPRISES ALL REMAIN UNINTEGRATED.  APPARENTLY LULLED BY 
RECENT IMPROVEMENTS, ITURI HAS VIRTUALLY FALLEN OFF THE 
TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT\'S RADAR SCREEN. 
 
3. (C) ENGROSSED IN SELF-ORGANIZATION, PARLIAMENT HAS ADOPTED 
ONLY TWO SETS OF MINOR LEGISLATION SINCE IT WAS INAUGURATED 
IN LATE AUGUST, NAMELY, THE 2003 BUDGET (COVERING ONLY THE 
LAST SIX WEEKS IN CY2003), AND A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS ON 
INTERNATIONAL LOANS.  THE LIST OF KEY OUTSTANDING LEGISLATION 
IS LONG AND INCLUDES THE 2004 BUDGET PLUS LAWS ON THE 
ELECTORAL SYSTEM, NATIONALITY, DECENTRALIZATION, POLITICAL 
PARTIES AND THE FIVE \"CIVIL INSTITUTIONS.\"  (NOTE:  ACCORDING 
TO THE TRANSITIONAL CONSTITUTION, ORGANIC LAWS ON THE LATTER 
WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN ADOPTED WITHIN THE FIRST THIRTY 
DAYS OF PARLIAMENT.  END NOTE.)  KABILA\'S DEPUTY CABINET 
DIRECTOR, GUILLAUME SAMBA KAPUTO, TOLD DCM 26 NOVEMBER THAT 
PARLIAMENT WOULD LIKELY HAVE A JANUARY RECESS.  GIVEN THAT 
THE OVERALL PACE IN KINSHASA TENDS TO SLOW BEFORE CHRISTMAS, 
THIS MEANS THAT PARLIAMENT WOULD NOT REALLY BEGIN TO WORK 
AGAIN UNTIL FEBRUARY. 
 
 
A LEADERSHIP VACUUM 
------------------- 
4. (C) INSTEAD OF WORKING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, THE TOP 
POLITICAL LEADERS IN KINSHASA ARE MORE INTERESTED IN 
APPORTIONING BLAME FOR INERTIA.  IN RECENT MEETINGS WITH THE 
AMBASSADOR, THREE OF THE FOUR VICE-PRESIDENTS EACH BLAMED 
OTHERS FOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S INACTION.  PRESIDENT JOSEPH 
KABILA, HABITUALLY SLOW TO MAKE DECISIONS, SHOWS FEW PUBLIC 
SIGNS OF INITIATIVE OR LEADERSHIP.  HE MEETS WITH HIS FOUR 
VICE-PRESIDENTS ONLY SPORADICALLY; THERE IS LITTLE 
SUBSTANTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM.  SAMBA KAPUTO HIMSELF 
TOLD DCM ON 26 NOVEMBER THAT THE CUMBERSOME 61-MEMBER COUNCIL 
OF MINISTERS RATHER THAN THE \"PRESIDENCY\" (KABILA AND HIS 
VP\'S) IS SUPPOSED TO SERVE AS THE MAIN DECISION-MAKING BODY. 
 
5. (C) THE INERTIA BEGINS AT THE TOP, BUT THROUGHOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT THERE IS A MARKED LACK OF ENERGY AND ATTENTION TO 
THE IMMEDIATE ISSUES.  FEW OFFICIALS APPEAR TO BE DEVOTING 
LONG HOURS TO THEIR WORK WHEN THEY ARE IN KINSHASA.  KABILA 
HIMSELF CHOSE TO SPEND A FULL WEEK IN KATANGA IN 
MID-NOVEMBER, MEETING WITH LOCAL POLITICOS AND REPORTEDLY 
DRIVING HIS 4X4 HUNDREDS OF KILOMETERS TO PERSONALLY INSPECT 
ROAD CONDITIONS.  OTHER OFFICIALS HAVE PREFERRED TO SPEND 
THEIR TIME TRAVELING ABROAD, INCLUDING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
PRESIDENT OLIVIER KAMITATU, WHO RECENTLY SPENT TWO WEEKS IN 
EUROPE.  ON 27 NOVEMBER THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT ON THE DAY OF 25 NOVEMBER, FIVE DIFFERENT 
CONGOLESE MINISTERS WERE IN PARIS. 
 
 
TIME, PATIENCE WEARING THIN? 
---------------------------- 
6. (C) ONE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT\'S 
LEISURELY PACE IS AN INVOLUNTARY DISSEMINATION OF AUTHORITY 
TO THE PROVINCES, WHERE REGIONAL MILITARY COMMANDERS ARE 
RUNNING AD-HOC DDR PROGRAMS AND SOME GOVERNORS ARE 
CONSOLIDATING THEIR FIEFDOMS.  ANOTHER EFFECT OF FAILING TO 
MEET--OR AT LEAST MANAGE--PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS IS RISING 
LEVELS OF DISCONTENT AMONG THE POPULACE.  THERE HAVE BEEN 
INITIAL SIGNS OF FRUSTRATION AMONG THE MOSTLY-UNPAID FOR 
SEVERAL DAYS RECENTLY, DUE TO NON-PAYMENT OF SALARIES. 
ELECTORAL PREPARATIONS--IN A MASSIVE COUNTRY WITH DEVASTATED 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND VIRTUALLY NO DEMOCRATIC EXPERIENCE--HAVE ALSO 
STALLED AT THE INITIAL PLANNING STAGE.  THE TRANSITIONAL 
GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY USED UP ALMOST A QUARTER OF ITS 
SELF-IMPOSED 24 MONTH DEADLINE FOR HOLDING NATIONAL ELECTIONS, 
RAISING THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WILL EXTEND PAST TWO PERMISSIBLE 
SIX-MONTH EXTENSIONS INTO LEGAL NEVER-NEVER LAND. 
 
 
GROUP INTERVENTION FOR DRC\'S DYSFUNCTIONAL LEADERS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
7. (C) THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT URGENTLY NEEDS TO FOCUS ON 
REGAINING ITS LOST MOMENTUM, AND JOSEPH KABILA NEEDS TO BE 
GOADED INTO ASSUMING HIS RESPONSIBILITIES AS HEAD OF STATE--A 
POSITION HE STRUGGLED TO ATTAIN.  THE AMBASSADOR WILL 
PARTICIPATE IN A DECEMBER 2 MEETING OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION (CIAT), WHICH HAS A 
THREE-FOLD AGENDA:  FIRST, TO REQUEST A MEETING WITH KABILA, 
THE VICE-PRESIDENTS, AND THE LEADERS OF PARLIAMENT, AND SHARE 
THE CIAT\'S ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION WITH THEM;  SECOND, TO 
URGE THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT TO GET BACK TO WORK;  AND

SUBJECT: KABILA APPEALS FOR CALM, VIGILANCE 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  President Joseph Kabila, Interior Minister 
Theophile Mbemba, and opposition figure Etienne Tshisekedi 
all broadcast messages to the public on 3 June, appealing for 
calm. On balance, the messages were positive.  Kabila 
discouraged violence, endorsed MONUC\'s work, demanded that 
politicians refrain from \'hate speech,\' and insisted that the 
transition would go forward.  Tshisekedi encouraged the 
people to maintain pressure -- peacefully -- on the 
government.  Since protests have ebbed 3 June, it seems that 
these appeals for calm were helpful.  End summary. 
 
President Kabila Speaks 
----------------------- 
2. (U) President Kabila spoke in French at 2315L, on national 
television and radio.  (Comment:  The use of French rather 
than local vernacular such as Lingala (in Kinshasa) or 
Swahili (in Katanga and the east) necessarily limits the 
\"reach\" of his message. End Comment.) He said: 
 
THE ENEMY\'S DESIGN 
 
--there has been fighting in Bukavu since May 26;  that city 
is now controlled by Rwandan-backed insurgents 
 
--this act is designed to prevent reunification of the Congo 
and extension of state authority over the national territory 
 
--it is no coincidence that the fighting started the same day 
as the swearing-in of provincial governors named by the 
central government 
 
 
AN APPEAL FOR CALM 
 
--he understands popular anger, because of the desire for 
national unity and territorial integrity 
 
--however, such solidarity does not warrant excesses which 
result in material and human losses 
 
--those who indulge in excesses are playing the game of the 
enemy, who seeks the slightest opportunity to disturb the 
transition 
 
--MONUC is on a mission of peace, and is helping the 
government to achieve transitional objectives 
 
 
WHAT THE GOVT. IS DOING 
 
--the people should trust government institutions, the 
police, and the army, which are relentlessly defending the 
republic 
 
--during a special meeting, the government made the necessary 
provisions to restore national unity and territorial 
integrity;  he promised to work hard and with determination 
to achieve these goals 
 
--the insurgents must lay down their arms, and Rwandan troops 
must withdraw 
 
--MONUC should act with greater determination to protect the 
inhabitants of Bukavu 
 
--he promised to fight with the people to achieve national 
unity, and called upon them to mobilize in \"disciplined 
solidarity\" in order to foil the enemy\'s plan 
 
 
NO HATE SPEECH 
 
--he called on politicians to act responsibly and avoid using 
\"hate speech;\"  irresponsible acts and remarks should be 
avoided because democracy means disciplined liberty, it is 
not anarchy 
 
--the government will respond adequately to the events in 
Bukavu;  these events shall not lessen the determination to 
continue the transition and the goal of holding free and fair 
elections 
 
 
Interior Minister Appeals for Calm 
---------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) According to Pol FSN, Interior Minister Theophile 
Mbemba spoke in Lingala at 1800L, on national television and 
radio.  (Comment:  Mbemba\'s words are important because he is 
one of the few senior officials with a local 
(Kinshasa/Bandundu) ethnopolitical base of support.  End 
Comment.)  He said, in sequential order: 
 
--the people should hold national interests paramount 
 
--those who want disturbances, which could lead to greater 
problems, do not like the Congo 
 
--the people should work together, so there may be peace in 
Kinshasa and the republic;  they should have love for all, 
help each other, not become divided, and remain vigilant 
 
--the government will do everything possible to rebuild what 
has been destroyed 
 
 
Tshisekedi Says \"No\" to Coup d\'Etat 
 
SIPDIS 
----------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Political opposition figure Etienne Tshisekedi also 
spoke yesterday afternoon;  various radio and television 
stations broadcast his speech, which was in Lingala.  He 
reportedly said: 
 
--the people are to be congratulated for becoming politically 
aware and active, which is the basis of democracy 
 
--supporters have been encouraging him to march with them to 
the seat of government, where they would proclaim him 
president of the republic;  this would be a coup d\'etat, 
another dictatorship, not the democracy for which they have 
been fighting 
 
--if his supporters march on government institutions, a hail 
of bullets will shower on them;  people should abide by the 
law, should not target foreigners, but continue to maintain 
pressure on the government to hold elections 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (SBU) On balance, Kabila\'s speech was positive.  Many 
observers were concerned that he would say nothing to dampen 
anti-MONUC sentiment or ease ethnic tensions, and perhaps 
even declare a state of emergency.  Tshisekedi\'s message was 
significant because many of the protesters on June 3 
reportedly shouted pro-Tshisekedi slogans and wrote 
pro-Tshisekedi graffiti.  It should be noted, however, that 
Tshisekedi\'s own home turf--the Kasais--remained quiet on

SUBJECT: ECONOMIC REPORT - MARCH THROUGH JUNE 2004 
 
1. SUMMARY. Prices and the exchange rate remain stable even 
through political difficulties. The mining sector has been 
extremely active. Mining company America Mineral Fields 
(Amfi) wins approval and signature of its USD 300 million 
contract and then changes its name to Adastra Minerals. The 
UK government has exonerated De Beers of accusations of OECD 
violations made by the UN Panel on Resource Exploitation. 
The Central Bank is liquidating the Bank of Commerce and 
Development. The local market is demanding pay by the second 
telecommunications charges. Truckers protested the high 
level of insecurity on the Matadi Road. Commercial flights 
between the DRC and Uganda are scheduled to resume. 
Zimbabwean investors bought the Hotel Karavia in Lubumbashi 
END SUMMARY. 
 
MONETARY AND PRICE UPDATE 
 
2. Prices have remained largely stable throughout the recent 
political crises. Only a slight increase was registered in 
the past two weeks. Inflation, year-to-date, is at zero (0) 
percent. Currently, food stocks are high, keeping prices 
stable. However, the amount of rainfall north of Mbandaka in 
Equateur province has been abnormally low - as evidenced by 
the extremely low level of the Congo River at present - and 
if this affects food supplies, food prices would be likely 
to increase. On the contrary, the dry weather helps firewood 
and charcoal supplies - the other major daily consumables in 
the local economy. 
 
3. The Congolese Franc (FC) has not fluctuated greatly over 
the past 2-3 months. The informal market rate hovers at FC 
385-395 to the USD. A slight increase (FC 5 band trending 
up) was noted in Goma and Bukavu over the past two weeks. 
This may be due to the relative lack of economic activity 
and access to cash resulting from the ongoing instability. 
(Note. The exchange rate tends to be slightly higher - 
approx FC 400 to USD 1 - in the Kivus and Kisangani. It had 
only converged with the Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and Mbuji Mayi 
rates three weeks before the hostilities began. End Note.) 
 
MINING 
 
AMFI WINS INTERMINISTERIAL APPROVAL, CHANGES NAME 
 
4. On Mar 12, America Mineral Fields (Amfi) won inter- 
ministerial approval from the GDRC cabinet for its joint 
venture with Gecamines for the Kolwezi Tailings project. 
Formal signing ceremonies took place on March 23 in 
Kinshasa. Amfi representatives in Kinshasa stated that the 
final hurdle to gaining approval was to convince the 
Presidency that no bribes had been paid in the course of 
negotiating the contract. The hurdle as explained to post 
was that the Presidency was so exceptionally surprised that 
AMFI got past Gecamines and the Mining Ministry that it was 
thought that a bribe must have been paid. IFC and IDC 
financing was held out as evidence of the inability of Amfi 
to resort to under-the-table deals. (Comment. Amfi did end 
up conceding to USD 15 million in lump sum payments to 
Gecamines, which could have expedited the deal seeing as the 
current senior management of Gecamines is scheduled to be 
fired in the near future. Bceco, one of the executing 
agencies of the World Bank in the DRC, recently posted in 
\"l\'Intelligent\" a public offer of employment for the soon to 
be vacant senior management positions in Gecamines. End 
Comment.) Amfi also recently changed its name to Adastra 
Mineral and hired Rothschild as the primary financial 
advisor for the Kolwezi Tailing project. 
 
SENGAMINES BATTLES WITH GDRC 
 
5. During March, the National Assembly of the GDRC and the 
Minister of Mines called on Sengamines to come into full 
compliance with Congolese law, according to Minister of 
Mines Diomi Ndongala. The specific requests are for the 
delivery of a feasibility study of the entire project and 
the inclusion of a member of Miba on Sengamines\' governing 
board. (Note. Miba is a 20 percent shareholder in 
Sengamines. End Note.) Sengamines is currently resisting the 
addition of a Miba member to its governing board and as of 
yet has not presented a feasibility study. 
 
AFRICAN GOLD PLC ENTERING DRC 
 
6. African Gold, PLC plans to form a joint venture with 
Tangold, Sprl of the DRC. Greendale Universal Holdings 
Limited is a shareholder. The preliminary agreement signed 
between Greendale and African Gold holds that African Gold 
has 90 days to conduct due diligence on the Tangold and the 
license agreement. African Gold must also complete a 
preliminary exploration program of the concerned concession 
(Portion 3 of Concession 38) and must also make a lump sum 
payment of USD 250,000. 
 
CADASTRE MINIER CHANGES MANAGEMENT 
 
7. Cadastre Minier (Cami) had shut its doors indefinitely in 
protest of a declaration by Minister of Mines Diomi halting 
the processing of any further new mining concession 
applications. This dispute ended in the suspension of 
Director General Ambroise Mbaka, who argued that the 
Minister neither had the authority to halt its work nor had 
given sufficient justification for the action. Diomi has 
technical oversight of Cami and cited an unfavorable World 
Bank report on Cami for stopping the reception of new 
concession applications. Cami has not been accused of any 
improprieties and has been cited by several mining companies 
as being the most professional of all the services 
associated with the mining sector. Nevertheless, Mbaka is 
out, and the deputy director, Joseph Ngoma di Nzau is now 
interim director and has pledged to improve Cami\'s 
performance. 
 
METOREX TAKES SCANDAL PLAGUED MINE DE L\'ETOILE 
 
8. In May, South African mining junior Metorex recently 
signed a deal with the GDRC for the development of Mine de 
l\'Etoile and Ruashi. Etoile was originally sold the Chemaf 
Sprl under suspicious circumstances. The contract - signed 
by Chemaf with Gecamines and the Mining Ministry - was 
annulled by Vice President Bemba. Metorex estimates that the 
mine could produce 42,500 tons of copper and 3,500 tons of 
cobalt per year with a life of 30 years. It holds a 52 
percent stake while the GDRC reserves 20 percent and 
Sentinelle (a local firm) takes the remaining 28 percent. 
Estimated investment is approximately USD 200 million with a 
first tranche of USD 18-20 million to come in June. Metorex 
plans to raise the second and final tranche of USD 150-180 
million in the next 18 months. 
 
KGHM PLANNING TO RETURN TO DRC 
 
9. KGHM Polska Miedz is considering returning to the DRC to 
develop a copper/cobalt processing plant near Kimpe. The 
total cost of the project is approximately USD 10 million. 
Equipment is scheduled to be purchased from a Canadian 
supplier. 
 
MINING - DE BEERS EXONERATED BY UK AGENCY 
 
10. In May, the UK Department of Trade and Industry 
determined that the allegations raised against De Beers by 
the UN Panel on Exploitation of Natural Resources in the DRC 
were unsubstantiated. The 2002 Panel report accused De Beers 
of violating OECD guidelines for multinational companies. 
 
MINING - GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF KABINDA REGION PLANNED 
 
11. Belgian mining consultants Bugeco is undertaking a USD 3 
million geological/mineralogical survey of the Kabinda 
region of the DRC (East of Mbuji Mayi - Kasai Oriental). 
Bugeco also advises the GDRC on mining policy. 
 
MINING - 21 MINERS DIE NEAR TSHIKAPA 
 
12. In early May, 21 artisanal diamond miners died near 
Tshikapa, Kasai Occidental, when a mudslide caused the walls 
 
SIPDIS 
of the pit in which they were digging to collapse. (Comment. 
This is not an infrequent occurrence. Pits are often dug too 
close together on unstable ground and are rarely reinforced 
rendering them vulnerable to collapse. End Comment.) 
 
BANKING - FORCED LIQUIDATION OF BCD 
 
13. The Congolese Central Bank (BCC) recently began the 
forced liquidation of the Bank of Commerce and Development 
(BCD). This was a small national bank with offices in 
Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and the Kivus. The BCC estimates that 
the total cost to liquidate the bank and pay the severance 
packages of the workers should not total more than USD 5 
million (less than USD 100,000 will be dedicated to 
severance pay). Priority for account reimbursement is 
focused on small account holders (e.g. less than USD 20,000 
or FC 500,000). Only accounts and employees in Kinshasa and 
Lubumbashi will benefit from the liquidation. The GDRC has 
made the decision that since the BCC did not have control of 
the bank branches in the Kivus either during the war or 
currently, the account holders and employees in those 
branches will be left outside of the package. USD 2.5 
million will be disbursed in June with the remaining USD 2.5 
million being disbursed from July to December. 
 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS - FEE STRUCTURE ISSUES 
 
14. The Union of Telecommunication Services Consumers (UCST) 
has filed a formal protest to the Ministry of Post, 
Telephones and Telegraph against the current fee structure 
utilized by cellular telecommunications providers in the 
DRC. Almost all providers have a pay by the minute system, 
rather than pay by the second. This increases costs to the 
consumer. (Comment. It is interesting that the market does 
not seem to have the power to influence the 
telecommunications providers through choice as in the US 
market where pay by the second fee structures have won 
through plan choice. End Comment.) 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE - NEW WATER SYSTEM FOR MUDUSA 
 
15. The ICRC opened a new water provision system in Mudusa, 
South Kivu province on Mar 16. The system was developed in 
concert with the local NGO Initiatives et Actions pour le 
Developpement Local and will service the villages of 
Lwanvuhye, Cirhagabwa, Cirhundu and Lugusha - a population 
totaling approx 6,000 people. The project took four months 
to complete and involved the use of two springs in 
Musheweshwe, the rehabilitation of one reservoir and 
construction of another, and the installation of 18 water 
taps supplied by 6.5 km of piping. 
 
HEALTH - SLEEPING SICKNESS OUTBREAK IN WEST KASAI 
 
16. In the Katende health zone of Kasai Occidental province 
an outbreak of sleeping sickness has occurred according to 
the director of the Congolese national program to fight 
trypanosomiasis, Dr. Victor Kande. More than a dozen cases 
have been reported. However, a greater number of people 
could easily be affected without GDRC knowledge due to the 
remoteness of many villages and the lack of adequate 
understanding of the disease by the local population. 
 
TRANSPORTATION - TRUCKER STRIKE ON MATADI ROAD 
 
17. In March, truckers initiated a strike to protest the 
high level of insecurity on the Matadi Road (National Route 
No.1). Truckers attempted to increase security on their own 
by traveling in convoys. However, the loading delays at the 
Port of Matadi while waiting for enough trucks to form a 
convoy was not cost-effective for the shipping companies. 
Truckers asked for increased protection from the government. 
The Minister of Interior has increased military patrols on 
the road and a curfew of 18:00L for travel to improve 
security. Traffic is flowing more normally on the Matadi 
Road at present. 
 
CIVIL AVIATION - FLIGHTS FROM DRC TO UGANDA TO RESUME 
 
18. The GDRC has reopened its airspace to commercial flights 
from Uganda. A memorandum of understanding between their 
respective civil aviation authorities provides the 
groundwork for the decision. However, a bilateral air 
agreement is still under review. 
 
HIV/AIDS AGREEMENT BETWEEN GDRC AND UNC 
 
19. UN OCHA press reported that the GDRC has authorized the 
University of North Carolina to establish an office at the 
Kinshasa Referral Hospital to help improve the fight against 
HIV/AIDS. UNC will also train health personnel. 
 
INTERNET AND INFOTECH 
 
20. Three companies, two of which are German (Keysystems and 
Nic.cd), are in a legal battle to gain control of the \".cd\" 
top level domain registry for the DRC. The Ministry of Post, 
Telephone and Telegraph may have given control over the 
registry to the third company, Congo Internet Management. 
 
AID - WORLD BANK GRANT FOR DDR 
21. In late May the World Bank approved a USD 100 million 
grant earmarked for the GDRC\'s Emergency DDR Plan. The 
program will support reinsertion of 150,000 demobilized 
troops and permit reallocation of government spending from 
the military to social and economic sectors. 
 
REAL ESTATE/TOURISM - PURCHASE OF HOTEL KARAVIA 
 
22. Zimbabwean press reports that the Rainbow Tourism Group 
(RTG) has purchased the Hotel Karavia (250 rooms) in 
Lubumbashi. RTG intends to remodel and rename the hotel the 
Caribbean; it is the largest in Lubumbashi. The total cost 
is estimated at USD 1.8 million. (Note. RTG also manages the 
Sheraton Harare and either owns or manages the Rainbow 
Mercure Hotels, Touch the Wild Lodges and Safaris, and 
Tourism Services Zimbabwe. End Note.)

SUBJECT: DRC - THE NATIONALITY QUESTION 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1051 
 
Introduction 
------------- 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Recent events in Bukavu (reftel) highlight 
the explosive nature of the nationality question, 
particularly for Tutsis in eastern Congo.  Current Congolese 
law does not recognize the citizenship claims of some 
longtime residents whose ancestors immigrated to the country, 
including the Banyamulenge Tutsis from Rwanda, who comprise 
less than 1 percent of the population.  The Ministry of 
Justice has drafted a law that would outline procedures to 
acquire nationality under Article 14 of the Transitional 
Constitution, which says that all persons of ethnic groups or 
nationalities present in the DRC since independence have the 
same legal rights as citizens.  The Banyamulenge, however, 
were not considered an indigenous ethnic group at 
independence.  Resolution of the nationality issue is needed 
before elections to determine who is able to vote.  However, 
with the many different opinions and emotions surrounding the 
issue, it is unclear how this issue can be resolved without 
lengthy, heated debate that could cause further slippage in 
the transition calendar.  End Summary. 
 
 
Citizens or not citizens? 
------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Although nine countries border the DRC, the 
nationality question in Congo is focused on Rwanda, 
specifically Rwandan Tutsis.  Many Rwandans have emigrated to 
the DRC, some as far back as the 19th century.  Those who 
came during the colonial period were considered by the 
Belgians to be Rwandan, but many have lived in the Congo for 
decades and have never been naturalized.  Birth on DRC 
territory does not automatically confer citizenship, so 
persons born to Rwandan parents are not considered Congolese. 
 
 
3. (U) In 1972, Mobutu issued a decree granting Zairean 
citizenship to Rwandans and Burundians who had been in the 
Kivus before 1 January 1960.  However, in 1981 Mobutu\'s 
Parliament abrogated the 1972 decree with a law stating that 
only those belonging to a tribe that had been present in the 
Congo in 1885 would have Zairean nationality.  All others 
could gain citizenship through a 2-tiered process (described 
below).  Because there were allegedly no Tutsis in the Congo 
in 1885 and the Banyamulenge (meaning \"people from the 
hills\") did not exist, this essentially stripped the Tutsis 
of their citizenship.  A 1999 decree made minor changes to 
the 1981 law, but the procedures remained the same.  The 1981 
procedures are still, theoretically, in place until 
Parliament finishes drafting an organic law to implement 
Article 14 of the Transition Constitution. 
 
4. (U) The 1981 law outlines two types of citizenship: 
\'petite\' and \'grande.\'  There are several conditions to get 
petite citizenship, including:  must be over 18, speak one of 
the Congolese languages, have had habitual residence for a 
continuous period of 15 years, not have engaged in acts 
prejudicial to the Congolese state, and maintained main 
material ties/interests in the Congo for the preceding 10 
years.  With petite citizenship, one cannot serve in elected 
or political positions, in the army or the police with an 
officer rank, or in a public position at the executive level. 
 Grande citizenship is much more difficult to get, and 
requires 15 years of status under petite citizenship, 
\'eminent service\' to the nation, and the recommendation of 
the Mobutu-era \'central committee\' (changed by the 1999 law 
to a \'legislative institution\').  Most Banyamulenge would be 
ineligible for grande citizenship, and as a result would be 
unable to hold positions in government. 
 
 
Banyamulenge seen as outsiders 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) The question of citizenship in the Congo goes beyond 
the legal framework.  Vangu Mambweni, head of the Nationality 
Commission after the 1992 National Conference and now 
Secretary for International Relations of the pro-Kabila PPRD 
 
SIPDIS 
political party, told poloff that most foreigners living in 
the Congo acknowledge they are foreigners.  In contrast, the 
Rwandans come over and proclaim themselves to be citizens 
without going through the process of applying for 
citizenship.  He maintained the problem is the disregard for 
proper citizenship procedures.  However, when poloff asked if 
the Banyamulenge would ever be seen as Congolese, even if 
they went through the proper procedures, he replied that the 
Rwandese want to come to Congo to rule over the Congolese, 
and if they change their ideology then they will be able to 
live here peacefully.  This statement shows the underlying 
attitude that the Banyamulenge could never be true Congolese. 
 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
7. (SBU) We have not yet seen the draft nationality law that 
was prepared by the Ministry of Justice and is currently with 
the Political, Defense, and Security Commission.  One MP told 
USAID-funded NGO NDI the draft could be finished by mid-June, 
but this seems highly unlikely given recent events in Bukavu. 
 Previous laws on nationality have defined citizenship on an 
ethnic or tribal basis and the Transitional Constitution 
defines it in the same way.  The new Constitution and organic 
law ideally should confer citizenship on an individual basis, 
not by tribal or ethnic groups. 
 
8. (SBU) The Sun City resolutions on nationality, agreed to 
in April 2002, echo Article 14 of the Transition Constitution 
and ask for a census to identify all nationals, immigrants, 
refugees, and infiltrators.  No census has been undertaken 
because there is no money to fund one, so it is unclear how 
that may factor into the draft nationality law.  The 
resolutions also leave the question of dual nationality, 
currently not recognized under the law, to future 
legislation.  All of the previous laws have emphasized that 
Congolese citizenship is exclusive, and given the tension 
between Rwanda and the DRC, it is unlikely that the new law 
will recognize dual citizenship. (Comment:  This policy is 
hypocritical inasmuch as many senior Congolese officials 
already hold European or American passports.  End Comment.) 
 
9. (SBU) Elections cannot be held until the nationality issue 
is cleared up.  Members of the RCD/G, who know it is unlikely 
they will receive many votes during an election, have an 
interest in their few perceived supporters, i.e., the 
Banyamulenge, being citizens.  Because there is a lack of 
political will toward elections and slow movement on laws in 
general in Parliament, there is no current schedule as to 
when the nationality law will be passed.  (Note:  only 2 
major pieces of legislation have gone through the entire 
legislative process since the transition began.  End note.) 
National Assembly Speaker Olivier Kamitatu has previously 
suggested July/August.  Recent events in Bukavu may provide 
an impetus to resolve this question sooner rather than later, 
but are also likely to increase anti-Banyamulenge sentiment. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) A clear nationality law is needed prior to 
elections to determine both who can vote and who can hold 
office.  The latter is particularly important to Banyamulenge 
politicians like Vice President Ruberwa.  However, attitudes 
take time to change, and many Congolese are skeptical that 
the Banyamulenge deserve citizenship, believing that they are 
still loyal to Rwanda.  Despite these attitudes, it is 
important to have a law that clearly defines nationality, 
preferably on an individual basis, and eliminates the 
ambiguities of previous laws.  Once there is a legal text to 
work with, putting the framework into place will follow. 
Unfortunately, debate over this emotional issue is likely to 
be lengthy and heated, risking further slippage in the 
transition calendar.

SUBJECT: KEEPING PEACE NOT MAKING WAR: DRC WELCOMES QUAD 
MEETING, VERIFICATION MISSION 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 1. (C)  Summary:  During June 22 meetings with President 
Kabila, VPs Bemba (MLC) and Ruberwa (RCD), visiting DAS Don 
Yamamoto and AF/C Director Al Eastham noted U.S. concern with 
the security situation in Eastern Congo, including the 
buildup of government troops; assured Congolese officials 
that, in the USG view, Rwandan support for rebel forces or 
Rwandan military intervention in the Congo are unacceptable; 
asked for - and received - Congolese endorsement of joint 
border patrols (with Monuc facilitation) in the Kivus, and 
urged the government to move swiftly on long-overdue military 
integration.  Bemba was most hawkish, openly stating that MLC 
forces are deploying to eastern Congo as part of the FARDC 
mobilization, and implying they are there to counter a 
possible Rwandan incursion.  Ruberwa laid much of the blame 
for developments in eastern Congo on shortcomings of the 
transition in Kinshasa and the government\'s failure to 
resolve the uncertain status of former RCD military 
commanders.  Nonetheless, he agreed the Nkunda and Mutebusi 
constituted \'insurrectional elements\' and that the best 
solution would be for them to go into exile.  President 
Kabila said FARDC forces would defend Congolese territory and 
that he had not ruled out a military solution to the 
Nkunda/Mutebusi problem.  He said efforts to restore 
relations with Rwanda would take time.  He said he had agreed 
to meet Kagame in Abuja on June 25, and also welcomed 
Yamamoto\'s suggestion that the next quadripartite talks be 
held in Kinshasa o/a the week of July 19.  The Yamamoto 
delegation also met with SRSG Swing as well as French, 
Belgian and British Ambassadors (and visiting British junior 
minister) to ensure a coherent message among the principal 
players. Belgium signaled the EU\'s intention to hold a 
meeting in Belgium in early July to examine ways in which to 
help address the economic crisis in Congo, and said the EU 
will welcome U.S. participation. End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  During their June 22 flying visit, DAS Don Yamamoto 
and AF/C Director Al Eastham informed their Congolese 
interlocutors that Secretary Powell and NSC Rice had been in 
contact with Presidents Kabila and Kagame to urge both to 
deal with the serious security situation in the eastern Congo 
with restraint.  Yamamoto stressed that the success of the 
transition remains a priority U.S. objective; that we believe 
that joint border patrols in the Kivus would be a good first 
step to help defuse eastern tensions; and that Monuc is an 
essential partner to the transition and efforts to ensure 
elections, and suggested that the next round of quadripartite 
talks be held in Kinshasa on/about the week of July 19.  He 
also reminded Congolese officials of the importance of 
maintaining the solidarity of the transition government, 
maintaining good communications with Uganda and Rwanda, 
beginning military integration and pressing forward on 
elections preparations. 
 
------------------------- 
Bemba, The Practical Hawk 
------------------------- 
 
3. (C)  MLC VP Bemba said that when the transition government 
was formed last July, no one believed that there would be a 
new rebellion in the East, but the debate on the appointment 
of new provincial governors triggered the old Rwandan \"game\" 
of trying to keep control of the eastern provinces, 
particularly the Kivus.  One unintended result of their 
aggression, he confirmed, is an improved relationship between 
the MLC and President Kabila.  He said that the MLC (and 
particularly he, personally) is convinced that Rwanda is 
directly involved in the events in the East.  The MLC is 
completely committed to fighting this aggression, he said, 
and if necessary will commit its entire 20,000 troops to the 
effort.  (Note:  The MLC seems to have already dispatched 
about 5,000 MLC troops to the East, and Bemba\'s own private 
aircraft have been assisting in the airlift of these as well 
as FARDC forces.  End Note.)  Bemba insisted, repeatedly and 
forcefully, that Laurent Nkunda is a Rwandan, not Congolese; 
said that he has known Nkunda since the days when Nkunda was 
a Rwandan intelligence officer in Kisangani and Bemba was 
starting the MLC forces there.  As for the fate of Nkunda and 
Mutebusi, Bemba bluntly said that Rwanda should take back its 
officers or they would be killed.  Likewise, Bemba insisted 
that the FARDC is not capable of combating the Rwandans (we 
agree), that only the MLC is able to respond quickly and in 
concentrated numbers, i.e., use the Rwandan tactics against 
them.  He reminded his visitors that he \"had trained\" with 
Museveni, who knows Rwandan tactics, and said that he had 
personally advised President Kabila where the government 
troops should be deployed.  He said that to date, the 
government deployment has only cost $4 million, and has been 
funded without affecting the budget.  He dismissed Uganda as 
a possible security threat at this time, characterizing them 
as less interested than Rwanda in maintaining their presence 
in the Congo.  (Comment:  While we agree in principle, his 
statement is a bit disingenuous, given his training in and 
links to Uganda.  End Comment.)  Instead, he insisted that 
the government had obtained a copy of a Rwandan plan to 
attack the eastern Congo (note: Embassy also had heard this 
from Presidential National Security Advisor, end note) and 
that GDRC actions are preventive and defensive in nature, 
responding to elements of this plan. 
 
4. (C)  Bemba emphasized the importance of the international 
community\'s clearly and quickly telling President Kagame that 
\"the game is over.\"  Referring to current Rwandan allegations 
that the government is again arming the FDLR to fight Rwanda, 
he questioned rhetorically how that would be possible, now 
that Monuc is in touch with the FDLR and has been working 
with them on voluntary repatriation.  Bemba repeatedly 
endorsed Yamamoto\'s call for joint Congolese-Rwandan border 
patrols (with Monuc supervision/facilitation), calling this a 
\"perfect solution\" to the Rwandan allegations of FDLR 
buildups - and, on the Congolese side, to allegations of 
penetration of DRC territory by Rwandan troops.  Likewise, he 
welcomed the second quadripartite meeting and urged that it 
be held as soon as possible.  He agreed that elections are 
essential, noting that the government had been surprised by 
the large mobilization of the Congolese public to protest 
Monuc and government inaction.  Meanwhile, current events in 
the East have set back by at least one year his efforts to 
attract investors to the Congo, he said, noting that even 
good economic variables (4% inflation, 6% growth and a stable 
exchange rate) are not enough to overcome a tenuous security 
climate. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Ruberwa, The Concerned Conciliator 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (C)  RCD VP Ruberwa, whose response to the crisis in the 
East can best be characterized as confused dithering, tried 
to portray himself as conciliatory toward government and MLC 
exclusionary tactics.  He bemoaned the current climate of 
distrust, and noted that an alignment of some transition 
elements against others could ultimately ensure the demise of 
the transition.  Events in the East, while troubling, pose 
far less of a threat to the transition than does the current 
way in which the government is operating.  For instance, 
deploying troops to the East without full and frank 
consultations with all the government elements, and without 
the consent of all the government elements, is not only very 
troubling but does not send a good signal for the possibility 
of military integration.  He also noted that if foreign 
troops again enter the DRC, it would be the end of the 
transition.  As to the eastern situation itself, in many ways 
it was completely predictable -- officers (mostly RCD) like 
Nkunda and Mutebusi have become restless because their 
situation is too nebulous, their futures unclear, the absence 
of military integration/restructuring is a major factor in 
their decision to take the actions they have taken. Ruberwa 
did, however, concede that Nkunda (and Mutebusi) represented 
\'insurrectional elements\' and should probably go into exile 
for 3-5 years, that this would be the best solution - but not 
in Rwanda.  (Note:  Mutebusi had, earlier that day, crossed 
into Rwanda with about 300 of his troops and given up his 
arms (septel).  End Note.)  Their men, however, should not be 
punished but rather broken up and integrated into the new 
Congolese military.  (Comment:  This solution could 
perpetuate the problem of alleged penetration of the 
Congolese military by the Rwandan military.  End Comment.) 
 
6. (C)  Ruberwa said that if the situation is to be defused, 
both sides must recognize the other\'s concerns, i.e., Congo 
considers that Rwanda is fueling aggression in the east, but 
Rwanda views with concern recent alleged DRC re-arming of the 
FDLR, therefore both states are acting from justifiable 
motives of self-defense. (Note:  There is no evidence at this 
time of any large-scale FDLR involvement in the Kivus 
situation, although a few -- around 40-60 -- FDLR troops may 
be mixed into Mai Mai elements who are assisting FARDC troops 
in south S. Kivu.  End Note.)  The U.S. can play a key role 
in facilitating dialog and understanding, Ruberwa said.  He 
was less enthusiastic about the U.S. proposal for joint 
patrols, but did acknowledge its potential usefulness.  His 
lukewarm reaction may have been related to his subsequent 
criticism of Monuc for not having already utilized its 
Chapter VII authority to attack the FDLR and drive them out 
of the Congo, or, at the very least, to disarm them and 
thereby eliminate their threat to Rwanda. Ruberwa cautioned 
that although the RCD wants to stay in the transition 
government, the confidence and communication issues must be 
addressed to ensure the RCDs continued participation. 
 
--------------------- 
President, In Control 
--------------------- 
 
7. (C)  President Kabila began the meeting by saying that 
everyone involved in setting up the transition government 
seems to have underestimated the enormity and complexity of 
the tasks to be accomplished in two short years, particularly 
when the government would be encumbered with a bureaucratic, 
heavy structure.  However, he said, he had reassured both the 
Secretary and NSC Rice that all other problems can be 
 
SIPDIS 
overcome, as long as the situation in the East is quickly 
controlled.  Rwanda\'s allegations of ethnic genocide, or its 
current insistence on an FDLR plot, are pretexts.  The real 
problem lies in conflicting political, economic and social 
interests, and geography doesn\'t help.  Bukavu is only 100 
kilometers from Kigali, but is 2,000 kilometers from 
Kinshasa.  As he sees it, there are four key elements in 
dealing with the current situation: maintaining 
communications with Rwanda (he pointed to the upcoming June 
25 meeting in Nigeria between himself and Kagame); military 
integration; ethnic relations, in which, he said, the 
government will resolve the Banyamulenge situation, and 
certainly refugees should return to the Kivus, as their 
safety is assured; and, elections. 
 
8. (C)  The Congo doesn\'t want war, but a military solution 
against Nkunda cannot be ruled out.  The government has taken 
appropriate steps to contain the problem and limit the 
consequences for the transition, he said, and also will take 
advantage of the presence of a large number of government 
troops in the East to begin the process of military 
integration, thereby advancing a second key objective.  He 
endorsed the concept of joint border patrols as a 
verification and security measure (although Rwandan troops on 
Congolese soil is completely unacceptable), and indicated 
that if these are successful it could pave the way for a 
broader improvement in Congolese-Rwandan relations, including 
reopening of embassies and an exchange of ambassadors. 
Fundamentally important, however, is a climate of mutual 
respect.  Kabila welcomed the proposed second round of 
quadripartite talks in Kinshasa, and noted that these talks 
could help lay the foundation for a successful Great Lakes 
conference by helping to improve bilateral relations between 
the DRC-Rwanda and the DRC-Uganda. 
 
9. (C)  He welcomed the U.S. message that the presence of 
Rwandan troops in the Congo would be unacceptable, but 
(somewhat stiffly) seemed to object to the broader message 
than the presence of other foreign troops in the Congo, who 
could be hard to get rid of, could endanger the transition. 
He noted that Congo\'s friends in Belgium, S. Africa, Angola 
and Nigeria have committed themselves to help defend the 
Congo or train its security forces.  He mused that Ruberwa 
must choose what to do, since he finds himself in a situation 
in which his cousins are fighting the government to which he 
belongs.  Kabila concluded by saying that the current 
situation in the East is like turbulence during a long 
airflight -- something to be expected but which must be 
overcome so that the flight is not diverted. 
 
--------------- 
MONUC\'s Mandate 
--------------- 
 
10. (C) SRSG Swing admitted that MONUC cannot handle two 
crises at once. MONUC\'s June mandate renewal request will 
focus on MONUC\'s current strategic objectives and request 
more troops and civilian police. He understood that 
peacekeeping funding is very competitive and agreed that 
MONUC\'s mandate should be refined. Swing described MONUC\'s 
proposal for a joint MONUC-DRC-Rwanda border verification 
mechanism. He cautioned that Rwanda has so far opposed 
MONUC\'s draft TOR for the mechanism.  In the wake of recent 
anti-MONUC demonstrations, MONUC is upgrading its physical 
security, working to improve relations with Rwanda, and 
seeking to improve its public image by meeting with more 
Congolese groups and producing a flyer (in multiple 
languages) to explain MONUC\'s mandate and activities. 
 
11. (C)  Yamamoto also met with French, Belgian, and UK 
Ambassadors, and visiting British Junior Foreign Minister 
Chris Mullen (who will also travel to Kigali) to ensure a 
coordinated message to the GDRC and GOR. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12. (C)  The Yamamoto visit underscored USG concern about the 
current political/security environment in Congo.  Along with 
other diplomatic initiatives (e.g., the British) this 
pressure may help to walk the Congolese and Rwandans back 
from a potential confrontation.  Although the situation 
remains dangerous -- with continued rebel troop movements, 
threatening statements by Rwanda, and a build-up of GDRC 
forces -- we are mildly encouraged by Kabila\'s commitment to 
meet with Kagame in Abuja and strong support for continuation 
of the quadripartite dialogue begun in Washington in May.

SUBJECT: 2004 ANNUAL CHIEF OF MISSION MANAGEMENT 
CONTROL STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE FOR KINSHASA 
 
REF: STATE 119327 
 
From COM Aubrey Hooks to Acting Assistant Secretary 
Charles Snyder. 
 
1.   As Chief of Mission for Kinshasa, I am cognizant 
  of 
the importance of management controls.  I have taken 
the necessary measures to assure that an evaluation of 
the systems of management control for Kinshasa has been 
conducted in a conscientious and thorough manner, in 
accordance with the Department\'s Internal Control 
Directive, to determine whether our systems of 
management control comply with the standards prescribed 
by the Comptroller General. 
 
2.   The objectives of the systems of management 
  control 
of the Department of State are to provide reasonable 
assurance that: 
 
-obligations and costs comply with applicable law; 
 
-assets are safeguarded against waste, loss, 
unauthorized used or misappropriation; 
 
-- revenues and expenditures applicable to agency 
operations are recorded and accounted for properly so 
that accounts and reliable financial and statistical 
reports may be prepared and accountability of the 
assets may be maintained; and 
 
-- programs are efficiently and effectively carried out 
in accordance with law and management policy. 
 
3.   The results of this evaluation and any risk 
assessments, OIG or GAO inspections and/or audits, 
management evaluations, and other pertinent reviews 
performed in accordance with departmental instructions 
and other relevant criteria, indicate that the systems 
of management control for Kinshasa in effect during the 
period ended June 30, 2004, taken as a whole, provide 
reasonable assurance that the referenced management 
control objectives were achieved. 
 
4.  The evaluation, however, did disclose the 
continuing reportable condition in our management 
controls: 
 
--Deficiencies in the current configuration of our 
consular section impede the efficiency and could 
threaten the integrity of the visa issuance process. 
 
5.  I have reviewed the results of the most recent risk 
assessments conducted at post, as well as the actions 
taken to correct identified weaknesses.  I certify that 
the actions taken/proposed will adequately correct the 
weakness identified and strengthen this post\'s 
management controls. 
 
6. I have reviewed the certification provided to me by 
the post single real property manager, and have 
satisfied myself that appropriate procedures for the 
acquisition and assignment of residential properties 
are in place, in accordance with 6 FAM 700. 
Specifically, post management policies are in 
accordance with regulations; the post interagency 
housing board properly executes its functions; OBO 
approval is requested for waivers that are necessary 
exceptions; and property reports to OBO are accurate. 
 
7. Enclosed with the letter version of this message 
will be an update of the plans for correcting the 
reportable condition mentioned above. HOOKS

SUBJECT: DIN/ODI ACCESS WAIVER REQUEST - KINSHASA 
 
REF: (A) STATE 111479; (B) 5FAM872 
 
This telegram is submitted to request approval of a 
Dedicated Internet Network (DIN) Access Waiver for the 
American Cultural Center and Public Affairs Section, 
Kinshasa.  Per 5FAM872, please find below the requested 
information. 
 
1. Post or bureau name; 
Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo 
 
2. Post or bureau point of contact, e-mail address, and 
telephone number; 
Floyd L. Wilson, WilsonFL@state.gov, (243) 81-884-0255 
 
3. Location serviced by DIN; 
 
American Cultural Center,  JAO Compound, 498 Ave. Colonel 
Lukusa - PAS section (IRC, Auditorium, and Audio-Visual 
technician).  The system also supports the Commercial 
Assistant located at the American Cultural Center building. 
 
4. Type of Internet access service (DSL, dial-up, other); 
 
Wireless ISP, T1 LAN - (with 128 Kpbs in uplink and 128 Kpbs 
in downlink) 
 
5. Configuration details (number of connections, users, 
rooms to be served); 
 
One wireless ISP connection is used for the following: 
 
- Proxy-server (2, i.e. 1 at ISC, 1 at IRC) 
- Development and testing (2 workstations at ISC) 
- Public access workstations for IRC (8 terminals) 
- Public access workstation for Commercial Library (1 
terminal) 
- Back up workstations at IRC staff & Audio-Visual 
technician desks (3 terminals) 
- All the workstations are connected to one modem 
- Projected DVC equipment to (possibly) connect in the next 
door auditorium 
- Allow public internet access for those doing research 
projects 
 
6. Purpose of the service; 
 
The DIN will serve to provide the following: 
- Public access Internet workstations, for research, online 
forums, online courses, memo stick for copying large files, 
etc 
- IP video conference out of OpenNet 
- Test and develop new applications and related (tutorial) 
training

SUBJECT: GDRC APPOINTS NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Gons Nachman for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (U) Summary. The GDRC appointed a police inspector general 
and two deputy inspectors to the Congolese national police. 
These appointments (drawn from the ex-government and the two 
principal ex-rebel movements) have been well-received as a 
first step in creating an integrated police unit, but their 
effectiveness remains to be seen.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On June 19, President Kabila appointed General Daniel 
Katsuva as the Inspector General of the National Congolese 
Police -- a position he held prior to the transition. He also 
named Benjamin Alongaboni (from Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s Congolese 
Liberation Movement - MLC) to the number two post of 
Assistant Inspector for Investigations and Operations (Note: 
This is an intelligence position. End Note.) and Constantin 
Mudekereza (from the Congolese Rally for Democracy - RCD-G) 
to the number three position as the Assistant Inspector for 
Administration and Logistics. 
 
Bio Notes 
--------- 
 
3. (SBU) Daniel Katsuva is in his 60\'s and is an experienced 
military ex-FAZ General and a member of the Mundande tribe 
from Butembo, North Kivu who represents the former government 
faction. He received professional training in France and 
Belgium and worked for many years in Mobutu\'s military, 
including a position as army chief of staff in 1979. Mobutu 
eventually suspended him for his alleged involvement in 
organizing a coup. After Laurent Kabila came to power in 
1997, Katsuva was named assistant police inspector. Following 
Kabila\'s death in 2001, Katsuva was named inspector general 
of the police for  the areas under government control. 
Katsuva is well-regarded within the Congolese police and by 
MONUC\'s Civil Police staff. He is seen as well-trained and 
willing to work with others. 
 
4. (SBU) General Benjamin Alongaboni is in his 40\'s and is 
part of the Gombe tribe from Equateur. Also an ex-FAZ 
officer, he received professional training at the School for 
the Training of Officers in Kananga and later received 
further training in Egypt. He is not well-known, but has 
long-time ties to Mobutuists. In 1997, Alongaboni went back 
to Equateur and joined Jean Pierre Bemba\'s MLC movement. 
 
5. (SBU) General Constantin Mundekereza is in his 60\'s and is 
a Mushi from South Kivu. He has a degree in political science 
from Lubumbashi University and has worked as an instructor at 
many training centers including the Superior Military Center 
in Kinshasa under Mobutu. After the AFDL came to power in 
1997, he was named provincial police inspector for South 
Kivu. During the Rwandan occupation in 1998, he became the 
RCD-G chief of police. Mundekereza has a good reputation 
within the police due to his previous work as a police 
instructor. (Comment: Mundekereza is seen as a nominal RCD-G 
member who joined this movement more out of convenience than 
conviction. End Comment.) 
 
6. (C) A Kinshasa Police Captain told poloff that people were 
pleased with these appointments as it was an important step 
in creating an integrated national police. However, staff 
want the leadership to address the lack of proper training 
for the police and as well as material resources and salaries. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The appointment of a national police inspector and two 
deputies representing different government components is a 
positive first step towards creating a unified national 
police. However it remains to be seen how effective these 
individuals will be in their respective posts and how well 
they will work with each other. 
 
8. (C) The MLC and the RCD-G have reportedly sought for some 
time the number two police post dealing with investigations 
and intelligence matters. This position has now been 
officially given to the MLC. The MLC\'s victory in securing 
this coveted intelligence post may reinforce RCD-G 
perceptions that the movement is getting less than its fair 
share of benefits from the transition.  Having lost out on 
the number two police slot, the RCD-G will likely seek 
compensation by demanding other coveted jobs that have yet to 
be shared (e.g., ambassadorships or senior positions in state 
enterprises).

SUBJECT: 2004 AMBASSADOR\'S FUND FOR REFUGEES 
 
REF: STATE 04483 
 
1. (U) Embassy Kinshasa nominates the following two programs 
for inclusion in the Ambassador\'s Fund for Refugees: 
 
 
COOPI (Cooperazione Internazionale) 
 
COOPI is a well-established Italian NGO which has been 
providing humanitarian assistance in the DRC since the 
1970\'s. COOPI\'s proposal consists of buying medicines 
necessary to provide health care to Congolese refugees 
returning to Equateur Province from The Republic of Congo 
(ROC). The project seeks funding for the area of Libenge, in 
the district of South Ubangi. UNHCR estimates that many of 
the 80,000 Congolese refugees that remain in ROC will start 
repatriation later in 2004. However, there is almost no 
infrastructure in place to receive them. In this context, 
COOPI\'s project will serve to prepare urgently needed medical 
assistance for returning refugees in a region that has been 
largely ignored by international NGO\'s. Specific information 
on this project: 
 
- COOPI estimates that this project will benefit up to 4,000 
refugees in the Libenge health area, including 2000 returning 
from the Molange Camp. 
- COOPI is requesting $20,000.00 of which $16,820 will be 
used to buy medicines and other medical supplies. The 
remaining $3,180 will be used for the transport of these 
medical supplies. 
- COOPI already has the health centers and medical personnel 
to provide health care to returning refugees. 
- COOPI estimates that it will take two months to accomplish 
this project. 
 
Doctors in Catastrophe (DOC) 
 
DOC is an international NGO which has provided health care 
assistance to refugees and local Congolese in North/South 
Kivu for many years. DOC\'s proposal consists of 
rehabilitating the Kalungu Health Center (physical 
infrastructure as well as medical equipment and supplies) 
located 55 Kms from Goma, on the road to Bukavu. The Kivus 
have a substantial number of Rwandan refugees as well as 
internally displaced people in serious need of medical 
assistance. Recent fighting in Bukavu has only aggravated the 
already dire humanitarian situation. This project will seek 
to assist Rwandan refugees that come from the forest prior to 
repatriation to Rwanda. This refugee population is typically 
afflicted by illnesses that reflect their displacement, 
respiratory infections, gastro-enteritis, malaria and 
HIV/AIDS. By providing health care prior to repatriation, 
this project will allow refugees to return to their country 
in a more dignified and stable situation. Specific 
information on this project: 
 
- DOC estimates that up to 18,500 people in the Kalungu 
health area will benefit from this project. 
- DOC is requesting $19,965.00 of which $5,600.00 will be 
used for construction costs, $ 5,400.00 for transport of 
logistics and medical equipment, $2,650.00 for supplies and 
medical equipment, $1,800.00 for an incinerator, $1,800.00 
for diesel for vehicles and a boat and $ 900.00 for other 
miscellaneous costs. 
- DOC will be contributing $25,500.00 to this project and WFP 
will be contributing food. 
- This project is expected to last three months.

SUBJECT: TENSIONS WITHIN CONGO\'S RCD EX-REBEL MOVEMENT 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  There is much frustration within the 
ex-rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), but members are 
divided on how best to proceed.  There are disagreements over 
whether to make more versus less concessions to their 
adversaries, how best to deal with current and future 
insurgents, and how \"Congolese\" the party needs to appear. 
We are more likely to see repeated challenges to Ruberwa\'s 
leadership rather than a formal split in the party, however. 
For now, membership in the RCD and its promise of possible 
largesse is more attractive than would be membership in some 
small, inconsequential breakaway group which is not part of 
the transitional government.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Former RCD Leader Criticizes Ruberwa, Rwanda 
-------------------------------------------- 
2. (C) Senate 1st Vice-President Dr. Emile Ilunga told poloff 
June 17 that current RCD-Goma president Azarias Ruberwa is a 
\"prisoner\" of Rwanda.  (Note:  Ilunga and Ruberwa co-presided 
over a June 13-16 meeting of senior RCD leaders.  Ilunga was 
RCD president from 1999-2001.  End Note.)  Kigali also has 
influence over top RCD officials Jean-Marie Emungu and Moise 
Nyarugabo.  These individuals represent Rwanda and the 
Banyamulenge community, not the Congo as they should.  This 
has weakened the RCD\'s political standing.  \"If the situation 
continues,\" he declared, \"the population will see us as 
nothing but subjects of Rwanda, and we will end up with not a 
single deputy\" in parliament.  Ilunga said that during the 
mid-June meeting he and others argued against Ruberwa, who 
wanted the RCD to quit the transitional government. 
Currently, several members including himself are working to 
oust Ruberwa.  In their view, it is better to remain within 
the party and try to change it rather than split off. 
 
3. (C) Ilunga explained that when he was RCD president, 
operating from Goma, Kigali was able to exercise a much 
tighter grip over the movement.  If we were still there and 
not in Kinshasa, it would be unthinkable to publicly 
criticize the actions of mutineers Gen. Laurent Nkunda and 
Col. Jules Mutebusi.  While the Rwandans are \"our friends, 
our allies, whose troops fought and died in the Congo,\" RCD 
leaders should not be \"slaves\" or \"vassals\" of Kigali. 
Ilunga added that Rwandan support for North Kivu Governor 
Eugene Serufuli is part of a deliberate strategy of 
sponsoring multiple proxies rather than a single ally in the 
Congo. 
 
4. (C) Speaking \"as a Senator,\" Ilunga said the transitional 
government is a failure.  President Kabila and all four of 
his vice-presidents are corrupt and hopelessly incompetent. 
Meanwhile, most Congolese live in abject poverty, get 
absolutely nothing from the state, and are seething with 
frustration.  He asked pointedly, \"What\'s more important, 
saving the country or respecting the Global, Inclusive 
Accord?\"  The aborted coup attempt of June 11 shows how weak 
the government is.  MONUC forces can and should take over the 
Congo, and countries such as Angola, South Africa and Nigeria 
could then send additional troops to help the Congo get on 
its feet.  Dr. Ilunga said he has already spoken to the 
British and Angolan ambassadors about this, and asked poloff 
to deliver this message to the Ambassador. 
 
 
Senior RCD Military Official Pessimistic 
---------------------------------------- 
6. (C) Army logistics chief Brig. Gen. Malik Kijege, a Tutsi 
who was until 2003 the RCD-Goma\'s chief of military 
operations, told poloff on 29 June he is pessimistic about 
the transition in general.  Many RCD members have left 
Kinshasa for the east, because they are frustrated with the 
slow pace of the transition.   Some have actually stopped 
refurbishing homes they have purchased in Kinshasa, and even 
traded houses with people in Goma who wish to come to the 
capital.  Kijege criticized the anti-Rwandophone rhetoric of 
figures such as GDRC Vice-President Yerodia Abdoulaye and 
pastor Theodore Ngoy, and said he thought a repeat of 1998\'s 
witch-hunt against Tutsis is certainly possible since \"the 
same people are in charge,\" but it would not be as systematic 
because unlike in 1998 there is a significant international 
presence in Kinshasa.  He himself was a battalion commander 
in Kinshasa at the time, and only narrowly escaped capture. 
 
7. (C) Kijege said that some of the officers in the east 
associated with Gen. Laurent Nkunda had previously been 
imprisoned not once but twice by Kabiliste forces, first in 
1996-97, then again after the second war began in 1998.  The 
February 2004 arrest of Maj. Kasongo in Bukavu was a harsh 
reminder of their potential fate.  \"Laurent and his men are 
already in the bush,\" he explained.  \"They are already 
excluded.  How can you solve the problem by further excluding 
them?\"  They have no other choice but to fight.  All parties 
in the Congo have blood on their hands, Kijege asserted, 
including President Kabila.  It is both unfair and unwise to 
single out a particular group.  Commenting on relations with 
Kigali, he said people should recognize that because of the 
1994 genocide, Rwanda thinks and acts \"like a wounded 
animal,\" and should not be backed into a corner. 
 
8. (C) Kijege was unwilling to venture an opinion of incoming 
armed forces chief Lt. Gen. Kisempia, but praised outgoing 
chief Admiral Liwanga Mata for being \"above tribal politics,\" 
which remains a serious problem.  The Katangans, he said, 
still want to be in control.  They care nothing for the rest 
of the country, however, so the result is \"secession at the 
summit of state.\"  Despite his official position as chief of 
logistics, Kijege said he has not been part of the weeks-old 
government effort to send troops to eastern Congo, and knows 
little about it. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9. (C) Many RCD members are frustrated and feel they have not 
fared well from the transition, but they are far from 
unanimous about how best to proceed.  Ilunga\'s and Kijege\'s 
views are representative of the two competing schools of 
thought within the RCD:  more versus less concessions to 
their adversaries, how best to deal with current and future 
Nkundas, how \"Congolese\" the party needs to appear.  We are 
more likely to see repeated challenges to Ruberwa\'s 
leadership rather than a formal split in the party, however. 
For now, membership in the RCD and its promise of possible 
largesse is more attractive than would be membership in some 
small, inconsequential breakaway group which has no seat at 
the table.  END COMMENT.

I. Summary of Significant Events 
 
A. Narrative Overview of Activities 
 
- On June 2, sparked by a temporary takeover of Bukavu, 
students and sympathizers filled the streets, throwing rocks 
and anything else they could get their hands on.  The 
protests were first aimed at MONUC, then the GDRC in general. 
Americans were told to stay at the Embassy or at their 
residences throughout the trouble. Employees were taken home 
from the Embassy and JAO in armored vehicles the first 
afternoon of the demonstrations by the RSO and ARSO. 
 
- A coup attempt the early morning of 06/11 woke the 
community to gunfire and streets filled with tanks and armed 
soldiers. A presidential palace guard led about 40 rebels to 
take over a local radio station and shut down the city\'s 
electricity. The attempt was quelled later in the day with an 
undetermined amount of casualties.  During both security 
incidents, the RSO used a new cell phone group text message 
communication link to keep the American community informed on 
what was happening and what to do. 
 
- Deputy Assistant Secretary Donald Yamamoto visited Kinshasa 
both in April and in June to meet DRC and business liaisons 
and to conduct town meetings with members of the American 
community. 
 
- Congressman Edward Royce and retinue visited Kinshasa and 
Brazzaville 06/26 - 06/30. Their schedule on both sides of 
the river and requests for armed escort put an additional 
demand on the RSO office. 
 
- ARSO Edward Webb and SSGT Andrew Sellhorn, the MSG 
Detachment Commander, left post in June for their next 
assignments in Washington, D,C.

SUBJECT: PLAYING THE TROOP NUMBERS GAME 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1131 
 
Classified By: Poloff Meghan Moore for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: The Government and rebel groups in the east 
are prone to inflate the number of troops they deploy, but 
clearly there is a build-up of troops going on in the east. 
As of July 1, the FARDC probably has about 14,000 regular 
soldiers in eastern Congo, including MLC components.  These 
forces appear to be mobilizing for an attack against Nkunda\'s 
positions in Kalehe and Minova (in the northern part of S. 
Kivu province).  Possible total rebel forces (troops loyal to 
Nkunda and possibly local defense forces loyal to Serufuli 
and some ex-ANC troops nominally loyal to Obed) are estimated 
at 6,000-11,000.  On June 21, dissident commander Mutebusi 
and about 300 armed troops crossed from Kamanyola into 
Rwanda, where they were taken into custody and disarmed by 
Rwandan authorities.  FDLR, Mai Mai, ex-ANC (RCD/G military 
wing) troops in Goma and possible external involvement from 
Rwanda, along with ongoing rebel recruiting are largely 
unquantifiable wildcards. END SUMMARY. 
 
S.Kivu Update 
------------- 
2. (C) On June 21, Mutebusi and about 300 armed troops 
crossed from Kamanyola into Rwanda, where they were taken 
into custody and disarmed by Rwandan authorities. Their 
current official status and what will happen to them next are 
unknown; the GOR is making no effort to restrain their 
movements nor to feed them.  As of July 1, the area around 
Kamanyola appeared calm and was under the control of the 
FARDC and associated Mai Mai. Mutebusi\'s withdrawal to Rwanda 
and his subsequent disarming are positive developments. There 
are unconfirmed reports of speedboats landing at Kalehe, 
however, and some S. Kivu residents believe that Mutebusi\'s 
\'flight\' was a trick to allow him to transit to Rwanda to 
join fellow dissident General Laurent Nkunda in the area of 
Kalehe or Minova, in northern South Kivu. There were 
unconfirmed reports that rebel forces reinforced troops in 
Nyabibwe via Numbi (these two villages are located between 
Minova and Kalehe) with the aim of attacking Government 
troops deployed to Kalehe. It is likely that the FARDC 
commander in the area of Kalehe/Minova exercises very little 
control over his troops (ex-ANC troops who until recently 
were part of N. Kivu\'s military region). 
 
N. Kivu Update 
-------------- 
3. (SBU) Goma remains relatively calm for the moment, but 
civil society reports suspicious boat traffic on Lake Kivu 
and alleges that Jerome Kakwavu Bukande, leader of the Armed 
Forces of the Congolese People (FAPC) currently based in the 
Ituri towns of Aru and Mahagi, and Nkunda may be working 
together. (Note: Rumors of Jerome and Nkunda have been 
circulating for some time, including an unconfirmed report 
that the two met in Kampala. End note.) Nkunda\'s exact 
whereabouts are unknown, but he appears to move freely in N. 
Kivu and has been seen in both Minova and Rutshuru in the 
past several days. In late June, MONUC military sources 
reported fighting in and around Walikale between two 
battalions of Mai Mai (about 1000 troops) who were sent by BG 
Padiri from the Orientale Military Region and ex-ANC soldiers 
who appear to be loyal to N. Kivu Military Commander BG Obed. 
On June 21, a MONUC military source reported attacks by the 
Interahamwe in Virunga Park. 
 
The Numbers Game 
---------------- 
(Note: All numbers are estimates, based mostly on information 
from MONUC and MOD sources. End Note.) 
 
4. (C) As of July 1, the FARDC probably has about 14,000 
regular soldiers in eastern Congo, including 2,900 FARDC 
troops MONUC military sources reported had moved from 
Mbandaka between June 16 and June 25. However, the MOD 
reports that the 3,000 soldiers in the Ituri Brigade who are 
still in Kisangani will not be moved. Most troops transited 
the Bangoka airport in Kisangani en route to other cities in 
eastern DRC. The garrisons at Beni, Kisangani, Kindu and 
Kalemie have about 2,000 soldiers each, and Bukavu has about 
1,500.  This estimate includes about 5,000 soldiers sent east 
by the MLC. It does not include the possible involvement of 
up to 4-5,000 Mai Mai; should they decide to involve 
themselves on the government\'s side (or take sides at all), 
that would push the total number of potential pro-government 
combatants to nearly 20,000. (Note:  In trying to determine 
exact government field strength it is important to keep in 
mind the Congolese military tradition of exaggerating - and 
sometimes doubling - numbers.  DAO estimates about 14,000 
total pro-GDRC forces in eastern Congo, to include 2 
battalions of Mai Mai at Walikale. End Note.) Troop 
discipline for all groups (with the possible exception of the 
GSSP) continues to be a serious problem. Although the FARDC 
did send foodstuffs, uniforms, and equipment with some 
troops, its track record in terms of ongoing troop support is 
very poor. 
 
Breakdown of Government forces 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Since early June, the government has moved troops, 
cash, supplies, weapons and ammunition eastward via 
commercial, private and MLC airplanes. From June 16-25, 2,900 
FARDC troops left Mbandaka, Equateur for the east. They have 
also been deployed from Kinshasa, Western Kasai, and may be 
gearing up to move out of Gbadolite. FARDC troop movements in 
S. Kivu, Maniema and Katanga continue.  The GDRC has sped up 
formal integration of Mai Mai elements in Katanga. 
 
S. Kivu:  About 1,500 FARDC soldiers// 2,000 Mai Mai 
 
N. Kivu:  About 2,000 FARDC soldiers 
Maniema:  About 2,000 FARDC soldiers// 1,000 Mai Mai 
 
N. Katanga: About 2,000 FARDC soldiers// 1,000 Mai Mai 
 
Orientale: About 2,000 FARDC soldiers 
 
Rebel Numbers 
------------- 
6. (C) Total Rebel Estimated Forces:  POSSIBLE (and we 
emphasize this) 6,000 ) 11,000 
 
S. Kivu:  2,000 troops loyal to Nkunda 
 
N. Kivu:  2,000 ex-ANC troops//5,000 Governor Serufuli\'s 
Local Defense Force 
 
Maniema:  100-500 ex-ANC troops 
 
N. Katanga: 100-500 ex-ANC troops 
 
Orientale: 100-500 ex-ANC troops 
 
FDLR Numbers 
------------- 
7. (U) As of January 2004, MONUC estimated FDLR strength at 
6-7,000 in N. Kivu and 6,000 in S. Kivu. 
 
The Wildcards 
------------- 
 
FDLR 
-------- 
8. (SBU) FDLR troops in N. and S. Kivu have remained 
suspiciously quiet throughout the recent buildup. There are 
limited reports of Mai Mai/ FDLR collaboration in S. and N. 
Kivu, but no reports of FDLR massing at the border or 
mobilizing for any military operations. It was widely 
reported that a small number of FDLR worked with Mai Mai in 
the Kamanyola campaign. Although there are a large number of 
FDLR elements in N. Kivu, their current activities and 
loyalties are completely unknown. 
 
Mai Mai 
---------- 
 
9. (SBU) Mai Mai units\' quality and reliability depend on the 
quality and interests of their commanders. They tend to have 
local interests and concerns, bad equipment, little training, 
and no discipline. In addition, certain commanders continue 
to work very closely with their former FDLR allies. 
 
Rebel Recruiting 
--------------------- 
10. (SBU) Nkunda has been recruiting in N. Kivu and in 
refugee camps, which makes it difficult to pin down his 
numbers. Human rights sources have reported recruitment at 
the Cyangugu refugee camp. The new recruits were reportedly 
being sent to Butare Training Camp in Rwanda.  In addition, 
UNHCR reports that things in the camp are \'not normal,\' UNHCR 
has limited control, and some Banyamulenge refugees who 
wished to return were not allowed to return by extremist 
elements within the camp. Nkunda has also visited at least 
one camp in Rwanda for unknown purposes, and the whereabouts 
of the 157 troops loyal to Mutebusi (including 12 officers) 
who were brought to the Cyangugu Transit Center June 8 is 
unknown. MONUC Child Protection sources report that certain 
Mai Mai groups and troops loyal to Nkunda and Mutebusi have 
forcibly recruited children. At the same time, some FARDC 
units in Katanga and Equateur have demobilized children 
before deploying. 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (C)  In the midst of a very fluid and unclear situation, 
trying to figure out who has what support where and how 
solidly they might be commited to the mission is extremely 
problematic.  What this exercise does demonstrate, however, 
is that this is the most significant movement of government 
forces (and allied elements) to and within the East in almost 
two years.  We remain concerned that despite professed good 
intentions of avoiding war, having this many poorly trained 
troops in a relatively small area during this tense period 
could all too easily lead to a confrontation.

SUBJECT: ROYCE CODEL HIGHLIGHTS INTERNAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
SECURITY IN THE DRC 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.5 b/d 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY. From June 26-30, Chairman of the House 
International Relations Subcommittee for Africa, Ed Royce, 
led a delegation, which consisted of Rep Royce, his wife, two 
staffers (Tom Sheehy and Malik Chaka), to Kinshasa focused on 
national and environmental security issues. Key meetings were 
held with President Kabila, VP Ruberwa, National Assembly 
President Kamitatu, SRSG Swing and a roundtable of NGOs 
focused involved in the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. In 
support of USG initiatives, Royce proposed holding a 
Congressional hearing on the subject of DRC internal 
security. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) The Royce delegation was primarily focused on issues 
of Congolese internal security and US investment in Vodacom 
(the leading cellular telecommunications provider in the 
DRC). Meetings with Post Country Team, President Kabila 
(septel), VP Ruberwa, National Assembly President Kamitatu, 
and SRSG Swing (Ruberwa, Kamitatu and Swing all septel) and a 
dinner with important political leaders provided 
opportunities to assess the current political and security 
environment. On all occasions, Royce clearly supported the 
current initiatives by the Government of Nigeria and by the 
USG to bring the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda to talks on regional 
security. He also made clear that he believed Rwanda to be 
involved in the recent spat of fighting in the Kivus. 
Security, especially an expeditious reorganization and 
integration of the armed forces, was seen as a prerequisite 
for elections by all participants. Royce proposed holding a 
hearing on the DRC at the subcommittee level to bring greater 
attention to the current tenuous political situation in the 
DRC. 
 
3. (SBU) On economic issues, a group of Royce\'s constituents 
invested in Vodacom had several activities organized 
including two dinners, a river cruise and a Vodacom 
facilities tour. Royce was primarily focused on increasing 
investment in the DRC, however, he did take into 
consideration the need to approve budget allocations to 
fulfill USG promises of debt relief under HIPC (Highly 
Indebted Poor Country) Initiative. Post also organized a 
dinner with local businessmen and US investors to highlight 
the challenges in operating a business in the DRC. 
 
4. (SBU) Royce is a co-sponsor of the Congo Basin Forest 
Partnership (CBFP) Act. To this end, Post organized with 
USAID a luncheon with conservation NGOs working on the CBFP, 
including the World Wildlife Fund and Conservation 
International among others. The topic of greatest discussion 
was the current rate of deforestation in Virunga National 
Park, on the border with Rwanda, threatening to destroy the 
last habitat for mountain gorillas. Rwandan cattle farmers 
have been burning large swaths of land on the DRC side of 
Virunga Park for use in grazing cattle. If deforestation 
continues at the same pace, the entire park could be 
defoliated within a few months. (NOTE. Post delivered urgent 
Virunga Park demarche to GDRC as well as Governor Serafuli 
and Regional Military Commander Obedi. END NOTE.) Royce again 
proposed action on his part in the form of holding a press 
conference to bring the problem into the public arena and 
shame Rwanda for allowing its ranchers to behave in this 
manner. All parties mentioned concerns that any initiative 
not be taken as placing the preservation of a species over 
the value of human life in the region - where an estimated 3 
million people have died over 6 years of war. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT. Overall the Royce CODEL was a good chance to 
inform Congress about necessary actions to be taken in 
support of the Transitional Government and peace in the DRC. 
His visit focused on broad issues of US policy toward the DRC 
(e.g. security, elections, debt relief). Royce\'s proposals of 
a Congressional hearing and a press conference in support of 
USG initiatives were well received by Post and local 
personalities. Ambassador emphasized the importance of 
Congressional approval of HIPC initiative funding. END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT: OSPB EXCEPTION REQUEST FOR CONSULAR BUILDING 
 
REF: JORDAN/MEDVIGY EMAIL DATED 07/02/04 
 
1. The ARSO has completed an exceptions request package in 
regards to the Consular upgrade project in the ref email sent 
to DS/PSD/PCB on July 02, 2004. This cable provides a 
synopsis of the exceptions package. 
 
2. The Consular Section has an ongoing project to address 
many of the shortcomings listed in a 2002 OIG report. In this 
report, the OIG noted that the consular officers\' ability to 
provide services to citizens and visa applicants was severely 
hampered due to their current physical layout. Some of the 
planned upgrades include reconfiguring internal office space 
and adding new hard-line doors. The funding for this project 
is currently blocked because exceptions to OSPB standards 
were not obtained prior to the Consulate\'s relocation in 
October 1999. 
 
3. After the 1998 Embassy bombings, there was a strong push 
to collocate offices within the same compound. Since the 
Consulate was located directly on a heavily traveled street 
where there was not a protected perimeter, the former post 
administration decided to move the Consulate to the Chancery 
compound. This new facility was an existing structure on the 
compound. This structure formerly housed equipment for a 
telecommunication\'s project. The walls were built to FE/BR 
standard. Additionally it is located off Dumi Street which is 
a lightly traveled thoroughfare. There is also a ring of 
bollards which prevent vehicles from driving right into the 
building. Unlike the former location, the new structure does 
not have several large glass windows. In sum, the current 
Consular facility is located in a much more secure location. 
However, the prior post administration did not submit the 
required OSPB exception\'s package before they relocated. 
 
4. Without the requested Consular building improvements, the 
officers\' ability to accomplish their mission will be 
considerably diminished. They cannot restart the immigrant 
visa process without line of sight supervision of the local 
staff. Furthermore, OIG noted that Embassy Kinshasa should 
\"ask the department for urgent assistance to remedy the 
problems.\" The Consular building is now located in far better 
protected structure. The Consulate is in close proximity to 
the Embassy and with the existing physical security measures 
mean that they are better protected. We firmly believe that 
the security of the Consular officers is not compromised in 
their current location. 
 
5. The following exceptions to OSPB standards will need to be 
granted: 
 
    a. A CAC allowing passage through the perimeter. 
    b. A blast vulnerability study. 
    c. Exterior walls that provide 15 minute FE/BR protection. 
    d. Exterior doors that provide 15 minute FE/BR protection. 
    e. Interior hardline that provides 15 minute FE/BR 
       protection. 
    f. A guard booth that provides 15 minute FE/BR protection. 
    g. A clear zone on new office buildings. 
    h. Setback requirements 
 
6. Please review the exceptions package at your earliest 
convenience and let us know if additional information is 
required. 
 
7. We look forward to your positive response. POC is ARSO

SUBJECT: KISANGANI TENSE AS POPULATION FEARS SPREAD OF 
CONFLICT TO THEIR REGION 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Gons Nachman for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary. Kisangani is currently tense as population 
remains concerned about possible Rwandan aggression through 
dissident RCD-G officer Laurent Nkunda. A large presence by 
various GDRC military components has also added to this 
tension and could increase the potential for problems, 
especially if the supplies of food, etc. currently being 
supplied by Kinshasa should cease. End Summary. 
 
Strong GDRC Military Presence in Kisangani 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Poloff spoke with NGO sources during a June 30 visit 
to Kisangani. They said that although many soldiers had 
transited through Kisangani on their way to Bukavu over the 
past three weeks, close to 7,000 of them remained in 
Kisangani. This figure includes: 
 
- FARDC\'s Integrated Brigade: 3,500 
- GSSP (Presidential Guard):  1,500-2,000 
- Former RCD-G\'s 7th brigade: 1,000-1,500 
- Mai-Mai (loyal to Padiri):  1,000 
 
3. (C) Well-armed GSSP soldiers have created a roadblock 
outside of the Kisangani airport where they search all 
non-MONUC vehicles. They also have a strong presence in the 
airport itself, guarding access to terminals and tarmac 
areas. This has created some tension with civilian 
authorities and travelers. 
 
4. (C) According to NGOs, FARDC\'s newly trained integrated 
brigade remains in Kisangani waiting for a yet to be 
determined deployment. Although this brigade was initially 
conceived as a peacekeeping-support initiative to assist 
MONUC in Ituri, FARDC officials are reported to be discussing 
instead the possible use of this brigade as a new \"Kivus 
Brigade\".  NGOs also note that this brigade is currently 
receiving little if any support from the GDRC and that 
soldiers do not have enough food to eat. (Comment: Sending 
this brigade to the Kivus could pose a serious problem as 
these soldiers lack basic combat training and may receive 
little if any logistical support from the GDRC. End Comment.) 
 
Population Fears Nkunda and Rwandan Intentions 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5. (C) Congolese human rights workers said that there was 
considerable fear among the population about Rwanda\'s 
intentions towards the DRC. Many people see dissident RCD-G 
officer Laurent Nkunda as a front for Rwanda\'s efforts to 
control the East in order to pursue economic exploitation. 
 
6. (C) A confrontation between members of General Padiri\'s 
9th and General Obed\'s 8th military regions on June 17th was 
seen by people in Kisangani as an effort by Obed to stop the 
advance of Padiri\'s forces into Walikale. Mai Mai forces 
loyal to Padiri had also engaged in a confrontation with 
soldiers from the 8th military region days before that in the 
same area of Walikale. Sources in Kisangani said that they 
expect further confrontations as FARDC forces from Kisangani 
will attempt to confront Nkunda in the near future. Indeed, 
Padiri recently traveled to Lubutu-Walikale to mobilize 
government forces in the area for future operations. 
 
Growing anti-Rwandan and Some Anti-American Sentiment 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7. (C) Congolese NGO workers in Kisangani said that people 
were trying to boycott Rwandan-owned businesses such as a 
telecom company and various supermarkets due to growing anger 
and frustration with their perceived aggression towards the 
DRC. The RCD-G\'s reputation has also suffered as a 
consequence of RCD-G dissident\'s Nkunda and Mutebusi\'s 
actions in Bukavu. Although the RCD-G was not popular in 
Kisangani prior to the latest round of problems in Bukavu, it 
did have some limited support. Now the RCD-G is widely viewed 
as a unpatriotic entity largely controlled by Rwanda. 
Nonetheless, people are also giving the benefit of the doubt 
to newly appointed RCD-G Governor Theo Baruti, mainly because 
he was appointed by the national government and because he 
has tried to reassure the population with a professional and 
diplomatic approach. 
 
8. (C) Atanas Zafiropulos, who runs the Hellenic Club 
Restaurant in Kisangani (Note: One of only three remaining 
Greek nationals from a community that once had over 1,500 
members. End Note.) said that he had heard anti-American 
comments during demonstrations against MONUC earlier in June. 
He noted that USAID\'s office had been specifically targeted 
and that Congolese blamed the US for not pressuring Rwanda to 
stop its aggression. Various Congolese also said that the US 
and Great Britain had the influence to control Rwanda, but 
had refused to do so. Some actually suggested that Anglophone 
South African UN peacekeepers had sympathies for Rwanda and 
had purposely refused to confront them in the Kivus. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Kisangani will continue to experience tension as long 
as the Nkunda situation remains unresolved. However, a poorly 
coordinated effort by ill-equipped and poorly trained 
government soldiers could also prove disastrous. Growing 
militarization of the area will also increase the potential 
for conflict between armed groups and the population. Reports 
that soldiers from FARDC\'s newly integrated brigade in 
Kisangani are not being paid and do not have food to eat are 
also of concern as this increases the likelihood that they 
will prey on civilians for their sustenance.

SUBJECT: PORT OF MATADI MISSES IMO DEADLINE 
 
1. SUMMARY. During the first quarter of 2004, the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandated that all 
ports worldwide improve their facilities and security 
measures to come in line with new International Ship and Port 
Facility Security (ISPS) code standards. The Port of Matadi, 
DRC has not met the July 1 deadline and may now face IMO 
sanctions.  The port has completed approximately 85 percent 
of the changes and improvements required by the IMO. Post is 
not yet certain of what action the IMO will take. GDRC has 
until July 15 to respond to the IMO and request a grace 
period. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. Upgrades to the Port of Matadi are approximately 85 
percent complete, according to ONATRA (Congolese port 
authority). The main components still missing are the main 
access gates, CCTV network, and some equipment for the 
security and control offices. However, the security wall 
around Zone A (primary entry zone) has been completed and 
access to the Port is limited to only authorized shipping 
companies and government workers. Consultants from the port 
authority of Antwerp are still in the DRC to help complete 
the process. 
 
3. Although ONATRA has not met the deadline, it expects to 
escape serious sanctions by the IMO. ONATRA has until July 15 
to request additional time to repair the Port of Matadi. It 
will attach its plan for completing the rehabilitation of 
Matadi, which estimates a total cost of slightly over USD 4 
million, of which USD 2 million comes from the World Bank 
Emergency Multisectoral Rehabilitation and Reconstruction 
Plan. ONATRA continues to work with the consultants from 
Antwerp to expedite the completion of security and 
infrastructure upgrades. 
 
4. However, ONATRA may find itself in a difficult spot if an 
employee strike continues. The strike was originally to 
protest the taking of a tract of land which held ONATRA\'s 
only locomotive workshop in Kinshasa by the Ministry of Land 
Affairs for the purpose of residential construction. The 
Minister of Transportation and ONATRA moved to gain the 
support of Vice President for Reconstruction and Development 
Yerodia. The land was returned to ONATRA before any work 
could be done to transform it to residential property. 
However, the lost workhours due to the strike cost ONATRA 
approximately USD 380,000. Meanwhile, it only recently paid 
the workers\' salaries for May. The workers are now protesting 
for the immediate payment of their June salaries. 
 
5. COMMENT. Although ONATRA has made a strong effort to 
improve security and port operations at Matadi, they still 
fall short. Furthermore, financing from the GDRC to help 
complete the repairs is not coming as fast as is necessary. 
It is not clear what sort of action the IMO will take. 
Consensus opinion is that the Port will evade closure, 
however, lesser sanctions are possible. A grace period to 
complete the repairs and upgrades is certainly likely. As is 
the case with all Congolese government agencies or state 
owned enterprises, ONATRA is publicly assuming a best case 
scenario of no sanctions and a grace period. However, they 
are extremely concerned about the lack of funding from the 
GDRC and the looming possibility of sanctions. Nevertheless, 
ONATRA continues to have financial difficulties and the 
current strike only exacerbates its situation. The 
consequences of a closure of Matadi or of a sharp decline in 
traffic to the economy in the Western DRC would be serious as 
it is the DRC\'s only large international maritime port. END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT: OFDA REP VISIT TO BARAKA AND FIZI 
 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) OFDA Rep Victor Bushamuka visited Baraka and 
  Fizi, South Kivu province from May 18 to 20 to 
  evaluate the security and humanitarian situations 
  in that part of South Kivu Province.  The area was 
  found to be highly militarized, the situation 
  still remains somewhat tense, and the population 
  still fears a renewal of hostilities. Authorities 
  estimate that only 30% of the Fizi pre-war 
  population, and 60% of Baraka population, have yet 
  returned.  For logistic and security reasons, 
  UNHCR does not plan to assist in the return of 
  refugees to this area until 2005. END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Military Control and Security between Uvira and 
Baraka 
------ 
 
2. (U) Traveling from Uvira to Baraka on May 18, OFDA 
  Rep Victor Bushamuka observed many heavily armed 
  troops deployed along the road, and felt that the 
  general climate was more of continuing hostilities 
  rather than peace. Ex-RCD/G army and Mai-Mai 
  forces control different villages along this road. 
  The villages on the Uvira-Lweba stretch, about 60 
  km long, are generally under Mai-Mai control. 
  However, within this area, key villages having 
  road access to the high plateau are all controlled 
  by ex-RCD soldiers. The remaining section of the 
  road, running about 30km from Lweba to Baraka, is 
  exclusively under the control of ex-RCD troops. 
  When OFDA Rep traveled, there were multiple check 
  points along the road where \"taxes\" were extorted 
  from commercial vehicle operators and bicycle 
  traders.  Although, well-marked humanitarian 
  vehicles are not taxed, humanitarians are 
  nevertheless obliged to stop at these check 
  points. It was claimed by some of OFDA Rep\'s 
  fellow travelers that though they constituted 
  harassment of civilians by military, the 
  establishment of these revenue-collection posts 
  had actually resulted in a reduction in the 
  soldiers\' supplying themselves via other means 
  such as pillaging and hostage-ransom schemes. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Baraka and Fizi under separate control 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Before the war, Baraka was under Fizi\'s 
  administrative authority.  However, during the 
  war, Baraka and Fizi came to be controlled by 
  different factions, which led to the establishment 
  of two administrations-an RCD/G-appointed one in 
  Baraka and a Kinshasa-appointed one in Fizi. 
  These continue to the present day, with Mutambala 
  Bridge, situated at about 10 km south of Baraka, 
  separating the RCD-controlled Baraka area from the 
  Mai-Mai controlled Fizi area. (Note: The first 
  village after Mutambala Bridge also used to be the 
  main resistance base of the Burundian rebel group 
  FDD (Front de Defense de la Democratie), which has 
  now left that area.  The Mai-Mai is well implanted 
  in Fizi, and is known to be fiercely opposed to 
  any Rwandan presence/influence in eastern DRC, 
  including all RCD/G elements. 
 
4.  (U) Though the FARDC hierarchy has reportedly 
  sent a commander to unify the military in Baraka 
  and Fizi, military administration remains as 
  separate as the civil administration.  The forces 
  on the ground continue to take orders from the 
  same leaders they did during the war and remain 
  extremely distrustful of one another.  All 
  vehicles traveling from Baraka to Fizi, including 
  those of humanitarians, are thoroughly searched 
  before being allowed to enter Mai-Mai areas. The 
  Territorial Administrator of Fizi even prevented 
  his people from collecting seeds and tools offered 
  by the USAID/OFDA partner Action Against Hunger 
  (AAH)-USA last season simply because the 
  distribution was being conducted from an RCD/G- 
  controlled area and was therefore to be considered 
  suspect. Thus not only does the situation present 
  a security concern, but also further complicates 
  the implementation of humanitarian activities in 
  the territory. 
 
5. (U) There are no check points in Fizi, except at 
  the entrance of the town. However, anywhere in Mai- 
  Mai territory, vehicles can be stopped and 
  searched by soldiers at any moment. In Fizi, where 
  the system of military taxing vehicles does not 
  yet exist, the inhabitants indicated that they 
  often have to share their meager food supplies 
  with soldiers. 
 
6. (U) Control of Fizi Territory itself is divided 
  between two major warlords.  Mai-Mai chief Dunia 
  controls Fizi town and the peninsula of Ubwari, 
  while Colonel Masunzu, a Congolese Tutsi 
  commanding some strongly anti-Rwanda Banyamulenge 
  forces, reigns over the high plateau area from his 
  headquarters in the village of Minembwe.  Any 
  movement activity in either of these areas must 
  first be approved by these commanders. 
 
7. (U) Humanitarian actors with whom OFDA Rep spoke 
  felt that the establishment of the transitional 
  government in Kinshasa had indeed resulted in 
  somewhat improved security for the populations of 
  Baraka and Fizi, but noted that the continued 
  presence of so many armed groups responding to 
  different control hierarchies nevertheless leaves 
  the area very susceptible to renewed conflict. 
 
 
----------------- 
IDPs and Refugees 
----------------- 
 
8. (U) On the road from Uvira to Baraka, the OFDA Rep 
  saw many empty houses and many fully or partially 
  destroyed villages.  There were, however, also 
  many houses under construction, suggesting that 
  people are indeed gradually returning to the area. 
  According to the administrator of Baraka, about 
  60% of the population has returned. 
 
9. (U) The situation on the Baraka-Fizi axis was very 
  different. Here almost all the villages were 
  completely destroyed and they remain covered with 
  tall grass. The road itself is overgrown by grass 
  and bush.  Only a few recent returnees were 
  observed trying to clear the grass around the 
  remains of their houses. In Fizi, the 
  administrator estimated that the territory has 
  regained only about 30% of its population of the 
  pre-war period. 
 
10. (U) According to the UNHCR estimates, about 
  150,000 of the refugees who are in camps in 
  Tanzania are from the territory of Fizi, with 
  100,000 of these believed to be from Fizi and the 
  remaining 50,000 from the villages on the axis 
  from Makobola to Baraka.  Recent returnees 
  reported that food rations were being reduced in 
  the camps, leading more refugees to consider a 
  return to DRC.  Many refugees have reportedly 
  stated, however, that they would prefer to wait 
  until July or August to make the move, so as to 
  permit their children to complete the school year 
  in Tanzania.  The recent security problems in 
  Bukavu and Kamanyola may, of course, make refugees 
  less willing to return to DRC than they were a 
  month ago. 
 
11. (U) A joint UN humanitarian mission was recently 
  conducted in Baraka and Fizi to evaluate the 
  possibility of UNHCR assisting refugees returning 
  to Fizi and Baraka from Tanzania. It was concluded 
  that while Baraka is relatively stable, Fizi is 
  still highly insecure and that security issues 
  would need to be addressed before serious 
  humanitarian intervention could be undertaken.  In 
  addition, UNHCR will not be able to make full use 
  of the port of Baraka unless it undergoes serious 
  renovation nor deliver supplies to Fizi until the 
  Baraka-Fizi road, and most particularly Mutambala 
  Bridge, is repaired.  UNHCR is thus currently not 
  planning to assist refugees to return until 2005. 
 
12. (U) Fizi residents felt that most people who had 
  taken refuge in the forest during the war, rather 
  than fleeing to Tanzania, have already returned. 
  While visiting returnee families, it was OFDA 
  Rep\'s impression that many of those who had come 
  from the forest were in relatively poor health and 
  manifesting clear signs of malnutrition, whereas 
  those that had been in refugee camps in Tanzania 
  seemed considerably better off. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Humanitarian Assistance in Baraka-Fizi 
-------------------------------------- 
 
13. (U) Though humanitarians have become more active 
  in Fizi Territory over the past year, most 
  activities have, until recently, been concentrated 
  only in and around Baraka.  AAH-USA has been 
  implementing an OFDA funded food security program 
  in which seeds, tools, and fishing equipment have 
  been distributed to IDPs and returnees. With ECHO 
  funding, AAH-USA also runs a nutrition program 
  with several feeding centers located on the Uvira- 
  Baraka axis. Also in Baraka, Aide Medicale 
  Internationale(AMI) and MSF-Spain have been 
  providing basic health care assistance to IDPs and 
  returnees. 
 
14. (U) Due to insecurity and logistic constraints, 
  Fizi was inaccessible to humanitarian activities 
  until December 2003. AAH has started, under the 
  OFDA-funded food security project, assisting the 
  population of Fizi with the rehabilitation of fish 
  ponds. Seeds and tools distribution for IDPs and 
  returnees of Fizi is planned for September 2004. 
  AMI had its first distribution of medicines to 
  selected health clinics in Fizi in May, 2004. In 
  addition, AMI is currently looking for funds to 
  rehabilitate some key village clinics in rural 
  Fizi that were destroyed during the war. The MSF- 
  Spain staff in Baraka indicated to OFDA Rep that 
  they are not yet active in Fizi, but plan to 
  provide basic assistance to the Fizi main hospital 
  later this year. HOOKS.

SUBJECT: CODEL ROYCE MEETS CONGOLESE, U.N. OFFICIALS 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  A CODEL led by U.S. Representative Edward 
Royce met in Kinshasa with senior Congolese and U.N. 
officials on June 28-29.  GDRC Vice President Azarias Ruberwa 
focused mainly on the shortcomings and alleged perfidy of his 
political opponents in the transitional government.  GDRC 
National Assembly President Olivier Kamitatu outlined current 
legislative priorities and spoke of Congolese leaders\' 
responsibility to their people.  MONUC chief and SRSG William 
Swing said the transitional government\'s success is still 
largely superficial in some areas, notably on military 
integration, and said MONUC resources are stretched thin by 
the current crisis.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) Additional Codel members included staff members Tom 
Sheehy, Malik Chaka, LTC Tony Steadman, and Ms. Royce. 
 
 
Ruberwa Blames \"Others\" for Failures... 
--------------------------------------- 
3. (C) Vice-President Azarias Ruberwa, leader of the 
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) ex-rebel movement, was 
generally downcast on the current situation.  Although he 
criticized the \"insurrection\" by \"former RCD officers\" in the 
east, Ruberwa condemned \"some actors\" in the transitional 
government, who think they are still at war.  These 
individuals (NFI) still make key decisions through \"parallel 
power structures,\" and deliberately promote hateful discourse 
in the public media.  (Comment:  These are standard RCD 
complaints, directed at President Kabila and his entourage. 
End Comment.) 
 
4. (C) In Ruberwa\'s view, the parties to the transitional 
government lack the will and the means to create a single 
unified army.  The international community should reorient 
its aid programs towards military integration, and slow down 
other forms of assistance.  He pleaded for greater USG 
involvement in this respect, and hoped the U.S. would 
\"ensure\" that the projected mid-July Quadripartite meeting in 
Kinshasa would be a success. 
 
 
...While Kamitatu Accepts Personal Responsibility 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
5. (C) National Assembly President Olivier Kamitatu told 
Codel the main legislative priorities for the near future are 
passing laws on nationality, voter registration and 
elections, and drafting the constitution.  (Note:  Kamitatu 
is Secretary-General of the Congolese Liberation Movement, or 
MLC.  End Note.)  \"We need to be open-minded\" on nationality 
in order to settle the issue once and for all.  But, he 
noted, even if parliament adopts good laws, the state is too 
weak to apply them.  Kamitatu expressed hope that the 
international community would maintain pressure on the 
Congolese to hold elections, and emphasized the importance of 
local-level elections.  Even after three million deaths and 
five years of war, he said, the Congolese do not want to 
divide their country.  Instead, they want decentralization, 
local decision-making authority, and accountability.  Local 
elected assemblies \"are the basis of democracy,\" should 
exercise authority over the local executives, and not rely on 
Kinshasa to solve local problems. 
 
6. (C) Kamitatu, in response to Congressman Royce\'s comment 
that the Congolese elite seems to lack a sense of urgency, 
explained that there is indeed such a sense in the interior, 
which is separated from Kinshasa by distance and shattered 
infrastructure.  \"It is our responsibility to change the 
Congo... a huge responsibility\" to create the conditions for 
peace.  The population in eastern Congo, he said, \"will never 
forget the war.\"  \"We need to fight against impunity, this is 
also a moral question for us.\"  (Comment:  Lip service or 
not, Kamitatu is one of the few leading Congolese politicians 
who speaks in terms of duty and responsibility to the 
population.  His statement regarding impunity puts him at 
odds with GDRC Vice-President and MLC chief Jean-Pierre 
Bemba, who is sensitive to charges that MLC troops committed 
serious human rights abuses during the war.  End Comment.) 
 
 
Swing on Recent Crisis, MONUC\'s Difficulties 
-------------------------------------------- 
7. (C) MONUC SRSG William Swing, Deputy SRSG Behrooz Sadry, 
and Deputy PolChief Albrecht Conze met with Codel and Emboffs 
on June 29.  In Swing\'s view, the situation in Congo greatly 
deteriorated in May and June, almost to the point of renewed 
warfare.  The Congolese need to keep the process moving 
forward, otherwise the international community would lose 
interest.  Unfortunately, \"the transitional government has 
not jelled.\"  It looks good on paper, there are lots of 
cabinet meetings, but there is little informal contact 
between former opponents.  The initial euphoria over the 
transition has worn off, goals are slipping, and mistrust 
between the different factions is high.  There has been 
little real military integration so far.  The Belgian-trained 
mixed brigade at Kisangani is ill-paid, ill-equipped, and 
barely supported by the government.  \"Without this, training 
is useless,\" commented Swing, adding later that government 
troops deployed to eastern Congo are the next danger, 
precisely because of such support-related questions. 
 
8. (C) Regarding DDRRR of foreign combatants, Swing said 
MONUC had repatriated 10,000 by March 30, but had made 
virtually no progress over the past two months.  There is not 
much evidence of ex-FAR/Interahamwe fighters continuing to 
serve in government forces, and, significantly, Rwanda and 
MONUC recently agreed that the ex-FAR/I number approximately 
10-15,000 combatants and 30-40,000 family members.  The 
current deployment of government troops to the east should 
actually help in the fight against the ex-FAR/I, and MONUC is 
also trying to go after ex-FAR/I supporters in 
Congo-Brazzaville and Europe, especially Germany, who are an 
important source of funding.  Swing said Rwandan president 
Paul Kagame told him two months ago that eighty percent of 
the ex-FAR/I would return to Rwanda if it were not for \"the 
hardliners,\" therefore it is critical to break their hold. 
If it gets more troops, MONUC can be more aggressive on DDR. 
However, Sadry noted, people\'s expectations of MONUC exceed 
MONUC\'s capacity.  The transitional government, for example, 
thinks MONUC is in the Congo to defend the government, the 
population, cities, and property, but MONUC is too weak to do 
this.  \"Our mandate has been changed to Chapter 7, but there 
has been no change in capability.  We don\'t have enough 
strength on the ground to enact Chapter 7.\"

SUBJECT: KABILA-ROYCE MEETING: SECURITY AND STABILITY 
FIRST, THE REST WILL FOLLOW 
 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.5 b/d 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. Security and stability of the DRC were the 
main areas of focus in a June 29 meeting between Rep. Ed 
Royce (Chairman, House International Relations Subcommittee 
on Africa) and President Kabila. Both Royce and Kabila 
eschewed discussion of recent negative security events in the 
DRC and instead spoke more of current initiatives such as the 
USG sponsored quadripartite meetings and the recent Abuja 
conference. However, Kabila made an effort to exculpate the 
DRC from any blame in recent events (placing the blame on 
Rwanda instead) as well as expressing his disappointment in 
MONUC. END SUMMARY. 
 
ON RWANDA AND THE VARIOUS SUMMITS 
 
2. (C) Royce commended President Kabila on his pointed and 
well organized performance at the Abuja bilateral summit with 
Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Royce emphasized that from his 
perspective, it was time for Rwanda to be part of the 
solution, not part of the problem in bringing peace to the 
DRC. Kabila attempted to put the recent events in context, 
describing them as a testing of the transition, much as 17th 
Century sailors had to test their ships against high seas to 
see if they would survive. In his estimation, the test is 
done and the transition will succeed. Furthermore, if any 
other difficulties do come to pass, they will be due to 
\"outside\" influence. 
 
3. (C) Regarding the June 26 Abuja Summit, Kabila viewed it 
as a step in the right direction and will serve as a model to 
deal with other countries previously involved in the Congo 
conflict (e.g. Uganda, Burundi). He specifically mentioned 
that he took the opportunity to tell Kagame that Rwandan 
interference in the DRC needed to stop. 
 
4. (C) Additionally, the idea of the bilateral verification 
mechanism developed in Abuja was well received in the DRC, 
but he is waiting for a response from MONUC on the level of 
logistical support it would be willing to provide. Kabila\'s 
vision for the verification mechanism is of two small officer 
commissions from both the DRC and Rwanda, traveling on MONUC. 
He stated, \"say that the problem is at Sake,\" (Note. This is 
one of the rumored strongholds of BG Laurent Nkunda. End 
Note), \"then both officer commissions should fly to Sake and 
investigate, then write reports. The same should be done if 
we hear of Ex-FAR in Walungu.\" However, Kabila was quick to 
shoot down any notion of the verification mechanism being 
used to track Ex-FAR elements. His view was that it should be 
more of a confidence building measure. 
 
5. (C) Kabila was also positive on the USG initiative for 
quadripartite talks and clearly expressed his desire that it 
continue. (COMMENT. He appeared to be particularly interested 
in making sure the quadripartite meetings scheduled for 
mid-July take place. END COMMENT.) 
 
MONUC AND ELECTIONS 
 
6. (C) According to Kabila, Monuc does not have enough 
direction and needs to better prioritize its tasks in support 
of transition objectives. He outlined two primary tasks. 
First is assisting the GDRC in extending security to the 
troubled provinces. This would include DDR (for Congolese 
combatants) and DDRRR (for foreign combatants) activities as 
well as the aforementioned verification mechanism. Running 
parallel to that task but heavily depending upon it, is 
election preparations assistance, including working on the 
independent electoral commission and voter registration. In 
his opinion, there is no reason why Monuc should not start 
preparing for elections, even though the Congolese 
Nationality Law still must be approved by the GDRC. 
 
7. (C) On elections, Royce highlighted the importance of 
involving not only NGOs and civil society but also the 
military in elections preparations. He pulled from his 
experiences in election building in Nigeria with General 
Abubakhar. Abubakhar told him that it was a military training 
course to which he was invited at Ft. Benning that convinced 
him that a constitutional and democratic approach was 
worthwhile. Royce suggested that if there were qualified 
Congolese officers, such experiences could be worked into the 
context of military integration. Kabila agreed that this was 
an interesting idea and would like for the Congolese military 
to play a positive role. However, he noted the need for all 
levels of the population to receive some form of education in 
democratic governance and elections as they have not seen any 
sort of election since 1960. 
 
A SMATTERING OF INVESTMENT TALK 
8. (C) Royce was also keen on speaking of increasing 
investment in the DRC and praised Kabila\'s recent efforts at 
the international level to promote stability, stating that 
this type of progress is key to attracting investment. He 
specifically noted the potential for a tourism industry to 
blossom and bring much needed foreign exchange to the DRC. 
However, security was still a concern. Kabila commented that 
if he were in New York, London, etc. watching CNN, he would 
not want to bring his money to the DRC. He was sensitive to 
stability. However, in his opinion, investors must come to 
understand that the GDRC is trying to maintain stability in 
areas where the former government had control and slowly 
extend its reach to the East. Not the entire country is in 
chaos, and in fact, all is calm except for Bukavu. However, 
Kabila did agree that security and stability must come first, 
and the rest (e.g. economic development) would follow. 
 
COMMENT 
 
9. (C) Overall, Kabila seemed fairly engaged and responded to 
all of Royce\'s questions and proposals. Kabila took the usual 
line of blaming Rwanda for all of the problems in the Eastern 
DRC. However, he emphasized that he is taking a proactive 
route and is engaging the Rwandan government. Although some 
of his comments were evidently made to attempt to drum up 
support and funds for elections preparations, Kabila seemed 
genuinely concerned that if elections do not come in 2005, 
the population will be angered and the results \"could be 
catastrophic.\" Nevertheless, if one looks at the government 
budget, it is obvious that Kabila\'s priorities do not lie in 
military integration (received no funding and was not 
mentioned by Kabila in the meeting with Royce) or elections 
(receiving approximately USD 800,000 in 2004 when the current 
working budget projection for elections runs to over USD 250 
million).

SUBJECT: DRC ENERGY SECTOR UPDATE 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.5 b/d 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. Activity in the DRC energy sector picked up 
during the first half of 2004. Chevron-Texaco is in the 
process of selling its offshore drilling operation to 
European junior firm Perenco but intends to stay active in 
the DRC through exploration and pipelines. Cobil continues to 
function as a parastatal despite some discontent within the 
government over the purchase of former Mobil Oil Congo 
assets. Construction has begun on two hydroelectric plants in 
Kasai Occidental and Bandundu while progress is made in 
financing a third in North Kivu. END SUMMARY 
 
CHEVRON-TEXACO CHANGING ITS DRC OPERATIONS 
 
2. (C) Chevron-Texaco representative Tim Magner called on 
Ambassador on June 8 to inform him of Chevron-Texaco\'s 
forthcoming sale of its offshore operations to European 
junior petroleum company, Perenco. Perenco operates onshore 
concessions near Muanda, DRC, formerly owned by 
Total-Fina-Elf. It has offered to Chevron double the present 
value of the offshore concession. Chevron had planned for 
7-12 more years of life in the concession (which covers 390 
square miles and produces 19,000 barrels per day), but were 
willing to negotiate on the terms offered by Perenco. The 
deal is scheduled to be finalized in early July upon which a 
press release will be made. Magner stated that Chevron 
preferred for the potential sale to remain quiet until 
completed because of political difficulties that might be 
encountered due to certain alleged shadow investors in 
Perenco. He alluded to President Sassou of Congo-Brazzaville 
and President Bongo of Gabon. 
 
3. (C) The GDRC acceded to the deal based on Chevron\'s 
continuing presence in the DRC. (COMMENT. It is important to 
give the perception that Chevron is staying in the DRC. Some 
economic and political actors consistently comment to Post 
that the USA continues to \"disinvest\" from the DRC, citing 
long past examples of General Motors and a recent possibility 
of withdrawal by Citibank. This creates a negative ambiance 
for discussions of economics and of US presence in general. 
END COMMENT.) The Ministry of Energy has been searching for a 
senior petroleum exploration and production company to 
continue exploration in the Central Congo Basin (essentially 
where the provinces of Equateur, Bandundu and Oriental meet) 
that was started in 1981 by Exxon. Exxon\'s research was 
somewhat promising, but most oil finds were heavily laden 
with sediment. Recent exploration has been performed by small 
firms such as King and King of Poland. Chevron has 
tentatively agreed to participate in exploration activities 
and will continue to maintain an office in Kinshasa. (POC: 
Legal and Government Relations Director Koni Mukoka. Phone: 
 243 81 700 8005) 
 
4. (C) Chevron also has continued interest in developing a 
pipeline from Cabinda to Luanda, Angola as well as 
development of processing facilities in Cabinda. The pipeline 
would have to traverse DRC territory (land or maritime) and 
processing facilities would necessitate a high load of 
electricity, most likely provided by a line from Inga Dam. 
Chevron intends to coordinate with the Reynolds Group which 
would like to run a line from Inga to Pointe Noire. The 
linchpin to this deal would be financing by Chevron and 
Reynolds to rehabilitate and upgrade some of the turbines in 
the Inga system. 
 
REPAIRS TO INGA 
 
5. (SBU) In the first quarter of CY 2004, Congo-Brazzaville 
made a USD 32 million payment to the DRC for an overdue 
electricity bill. The Ministry of Energy plans to use these 
funds to rehabilitate one turbine in either Inga I or II. The 
engineering firm to be contracted for the rehabilitation is 
Alstom-France. 
 
COBIL OIL - MINISTRY OF ENERGY REBUTS ACCUSATIONS OF 
WRONGDOING 
 
6. (SBU) Some actors within the GDRC and the private sector 
have grumbled that the purchase of Mobil Oil Congo (now 
Cobil) by the GDRC is not good business for the country 
because it now competes with the other petroleum parastatal, 
Cohydro. Furthermore, they claim that the quality of gasoline 
and diesel fuel is uncertain. Ministry of Energy Chief of 
Staff Guillaume Bolenga offered the following justification. 
(Note. Bolenga is also on the board of directors of Cobil. 
End Note.) The GDRC needed to purchase Mobil\'s assets in the 
DRC to prevent a duopoly of Shell and Total/Fina/Elf. Total 
holds 50 percent of the petroleum product market, while Shell 
holds 30 percent and Mobil held 15 percent. Both Total Group 
and Shell made offers for Mobil\'s DRC operations. The GDRC 
paid bargain basement prices for Mobil\'s assets, according to 
Bolenga, because Mobil Oil Congo had USD 2 million in debt 
and had not updated its infrastructure (e.g. replacing 
station pumps) in 15 years. Furthermore, the lubricant 
factory Mobil built in the DRC does not function and is 
dilapidated to the point of having little value. On 
competition with Cohydro, Bolenga explained that Cohydro only 
held 4 percent of the retail market and was primarily 
interested in transportation and distribution. (COMMENT. To a 
certain extent, Bolenga\'s logic makes sense. However, Shell\'s 
market share is largely dependent upon its sales to Monuc. If 
Monuc were taken out of the equation, other suppliers such as 
Sonangol and X-Oil would have much larger market shares. END 
COMMENT.) 
PLANS FOR PREPAID ELECTRICITY IN KINSHASA 
 
7. (SBU) The Ministry of Energy is currently in negotiations 
with ESKOM of South Africa to rehabilitate and extend the 
electricity distribution system in Kinshasa. In return, ESKOM 
will convert the payment system to prepaid cards until its 
investment plus profit is recuperated. The contract is purely 
notional at the moment. 
 
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION - CLACKSON POWER AND SEGELEC PROJECTS 
 
8. (SBU) Clackson Power of South Africa is currently building 
three hydroelectric power plants in the DRC on 
build-own-operate-transfer contracts. These dams are in 
Butembo (North Kivu), Katende (Kasai Occidental) and Kakabola 
(Bandundu). In Butembo, the main problem has been financing, 
in response to which the Ministry of Energy has negotiated 
for USD 200,000 of money liberated by debt reduction 
agreements (and earmarked for poverty reduction) to be 
directed to Butembo and in part to this project. (COMMENT. 
These funds are not sufficient for a several million dollar 
project. However, it is a proactive measure by the Ministry, 
in light of the small amount of the national budget directed 
toward infrastructure rehabilitation and development. END 
COMMENT.) Financing for the dams at Katende and Kakabola are 
largely resolved and construction has begun. However, there 
was a small problem with the local community at Kakabola 
which was withholding signing the project contract unless 
greater \"social programs\" were presented. The Ministry 
settled the issue by reminding the local community that the 
site for the project could be changed as there are many 
waterfalls and rapids nearby. To facilitate these projects, 
the Ministry of Energy is also negotiating preferential 
shipping rates on the national freight railway company (SNCC) 
to reduce material costs. 
 
9. (U) The Ministry of Energy is also negotiating a contract 
with Cegelec-France to develop another hydroelectric plant 
60Km from Kananga (Kasai Occidental). This dam would be 
larger than the one being built by Clackson and would likely 
be connected to the Clackson system as well as to the Mbuji 
Mayi grid.

SUBJECT: TRAINING THE CONGOLESE POLICE IN TIME FOR ELECTIONS 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Gons Nachman for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary. In recent meetings with Congressman Royce and 
Charge, SRSG Swing stressed the importance of having at least 
6,000 well-trained and equipped police to provide security 
for elections. The GDRC officially agrees that training an 
electoral police is a top priority, but has not committed 
sufficient funds to this end. France is currently training 
two integrated police units in Kinshasa which will total 2000 
by the end of September. Greater support from the broader 
international community will be needed, however, to 
successfully train and equip the force MONUC envisions and 
which we agree is needed. End Summary. 
 
Current Training is a Good Initiative but Much More is Needed 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Poloff spoke with a MONUC Civ Pol source in Kinshasa 
on July 2, about current training programs for the Congolese 
police. The source indicated that France has a bilateral 
assistance program to train 1000 policemen from the Rapid 
Intervention Police (PIR). Five hundred of these individuals 
have already completed their training and the rest will begin 
training in September. This training focuses on crowd 
control. 
 
3. (SBU) Another initiative is to establish an Institutional 
Police Unit (IPU), financed by the European Union and also 
implemented by France. This program seeks to relieve MONUC\'s 
Neutral Force in Kinshasa of tasks such as guarding the 
airport and maintaining security perimeters by replacing 
MONUC elements with 1000 police. In addition to training, 
France will also provide them with equipment to assist them 
in carrying out their duties. 
 
4. (C) The MONUC source said that the French were impressed 
by the quality of Congolese participating in this training. 
He also added that they had displayed a willingness to work 
together, regardless of their association with the various 
former government and rebel components. However, MONUC 
remains concerned about long term morale problems due to low 
salaries (currently $5-10 per month) and lack of proper 
logistical support from the GDRC. The only security unit that 
is well-equipped at this time is the Special Presidential 
Security Guard (GSSP.) The national police lack vehicles, 
communications equipment and arms. After the PIR and IPU 
units complete their training in October, they will receive 
equipment from the French. However, this will only represent 
2000 properly trained and equipped Congolese police officers 
providing security in Kinshasa, a city of over 6 million 
people. 
 
GDRC: Priority is Training Electoral Police 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Vice Minister of Interior, Paul Musafiri, told poloff 
on June 30th that the GDRC\'s top priority for the police was 
training a force to provide security during the elections. He 
said that since the DRC doesn\'t have experience with 
elections, the country needs to prepare police officers who 
understand the specific challenges of the electoral process 
and how to deal with them. 
 
7. (C) Musafiri acknowledged the serious challenges facing 
the Congolese police. He said that most current policemen are 
former soldiers who have not received any training in crowd 
control and who would be ill-suited for the elections. He 
also acknowledged lack of proper equipment and logistical 
support. However, he noted that the GDRC has very limited 
resources and would need the assistance of the international 
community to properly train and equip a police force in time 
for the elections. 
 
 
MONUC Plans to do Training but is Concerned About Resources 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
8. (C) Poloff spoke with MONUC Civil Police (CivPol) Advisor 
to the SRSG, Major Thomas Charles, on July 7. Charles said 
that MONUC\'s CivPol was taking a realistic approach to 
training the Congolese police for the elections and would try 
to do its best with the limited resources available. He 
explained that MONUC would ideally like to train 20,000 
officers for the elections, but given the lack of time and 
money, they would plan on training 6,000. This figure 
represents the minimum force necessary to provide security 
during the electoral process. In light of this smaller force, 
MONUC will seek to have these police posted to the larger 
urban centers and places that are most likely to face 
security risks, such as the East. 
 
9. (C) According to Charles, training will include 
refurbishing centers and will require a minimum of two months 
(Note: Currently there is only one operational training 
center in the DRC located in Kisangani. End Note.) MONUC 
estimates this training will cost $30 million. Charles stated 
that the GDRC allocated only $3 million for the police for 
the current year and have said that they lack further funds. 
He also noted that aside from training, the police will also 
need equipment and a guarantee of salaries for at least 4 
weeks to ensure that they will actually start working. 
 
10. (C) Charles was candid about his concerns over security 
during the electoral period. He indicated that the first 
electoral police units would only be ready in February of 
2005 and that the entire force would not be operational 
before April 2005. He noted that this schedule does not fit 
well with the pre-electoral period, starting with voter 
registration, which could start as soon as November 2004, 
which could be a time of increased tensions and potential 
civil unrest. In his view, both the Congolese and the 
international community should devote greater attention to 
the need for security during the electoral process, and try 
to accelerate the training schedule. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (C) The current training of two police units by France to 
provide security and crowd control in Kinshasa is much 
needed, since the Congolese police have not received any 
professional training for several years. Although the GDRC 
has said training the electoral police is a top priority, it 
has so far failed to back its statements with the necessary 
funds for training, supporting and paying the police. MONUC\'s 
plans to train an electoral police should be encouraged and 
supported, as security will be a key element in organizing 
and conducting free, transparent, and legitimate elections in 
the DRC.

SUBJECT: NEW ITURI DISTRICT COMMISSIONER TRAVELS TO BUNIA 
WITH OPTIMISTIC VISION 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Gons Nachman for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary. New Ituri District Commissioner Petronille 
Vaweka traveled to Bunia on July 12 with a goal of improving 
security, resolving the IDP situation and rebuilding Ituri. 
Although she is a competent and determined individual, her 
effectiveness will be contingent on receiving support from 
the national and provincial governments. End Summary. 
 
Petronille Vaweka\'s Vision for Ituri 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) As part of its push to reintegrate the East, Kinshasa 
announced on June 28th the appointment of Petronille Vaweka 
as new district commissioner for Ituri. Her appointment 
effectively brings to an end the tenure of the Ituri Interim 
Administration (IIA) and restores normal district governance. 
Vaweka met with poloff on July 9th to discuss her vision for 
the region. She said that her top three priorities were 
improving security, the return of internally displaced people 
(IDPs) and reconstruction of Ituri. Vaweka noted that these 
issues were intertwined and that improving security was 
essential to the return of IDPs to their areas of origin and 
would also make it possible to rebuild the infrastructure and 
the economy of Ituri, which in turn, would also foster 
greater security. 
 
3. (C) Vaweka acknowledged that she would have to work 
closely with MONUC in the area of security since the 
Congolese police in Ituri lack arms and all other basic 
equipment to function as a law and order entity. However, she 
said that she would also use her excellent relations with all 
relevant actors in Ituri to negotiate and encourage people to 
contribute to her vision for security and development of the 
area. She wants real DDR of militias and increased job 
opportunities for community re-insertion, especially in 
activities that would help improve the socio-economic 
situation such as repairing roads and rebuilding schools. 
 
4. (C) Vaweka welcomes the Union of Congolese 
Patriots-Lubanga\'s (UPC-L) recent decision to become a 
political party. She said that now that UPC-L had officially 
been recognized by the GDRC as a political party, she would 
work to sensitize its members in Ituri to the importance of 
giving up violence and using political channels to 
participate in the democratic process. She noted that she 
would also try to persuade other militias in Ituri to evolve 
into political parties and to disarm and re-integrate into 
their communities. 
 
Serious Challenges Remain 
------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The main challenge facing Vaweka as new District 
Commissioner is the lack of means to function as an effective 
administrator. She said that she is assuming her new post in 
Bunia on Monday, July 12, without any funds. The GDRC 
promised to send her one million Congolese francs (less than 
$3,000) by the end of July, to fund her administration. There 
was also no indication of when she would receive a salary. 
Vaweka was planning on using the offices, computers, 
furniture and vehicles left by the Ituri Interim 
Administration for the new district administration. 
 
6. (C) Vaweka explained that she had emphasized to President 
Kabila the importance of supporting the new administration in 
Ituri and showing that the GDRC was serious about 
incorporating the district back into Province Orientale and 
the DRC. She also said that she was ready to work with new 
Oriental Province Governor Theo Baruti, but wanted to avoid 
past practices in which Ituri supplied most of the revenues 
received by Kisangani and then sent to Kinshasa, but received 
virtually nothing in exchange. She wants an equitable 
distribution of revenues that would permit the effective 
administration and economic development of Ituri. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Petronille Vaweka\'s appointment to lead the new Ituri 
administration is an encouraging sign. She is a competent and 
respected leader who has excellent relations with all 
relevant players in Ituri, including MONUC, Kinshasa, local 
militias and community leaders. She has also maintained an 
optimistic and positive attitude even when faced by serious 
obstacles. However, without appropriate resources to pay 
staff and fund administrative activities, Vaweka\'s 
effectiveness could be severely limited.

1. (U) Summary. The GDRC has taken an important step forward 
in the transition with the appointments of ambassadors from 
the various composantes. The PPRD retained Washington while 
the important African posts of Lusaka and Luanda were given 
to the RCD-G and the MLC respectively.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) FonMin Ghonda notified Embassy on July 3 of the GDRC\'s 
decisions concerning ambassadorial appointments. These 
appointments represent a significant step forward in the 
transition process and the power sharing envisioned by the 
Lusaka Accords. The postings to capitals of members of the UN 
Security Council were divided as follows: 
 
- Washington: PPRD 
- London:     RCD-G 
- Paris:      MLC 
- Moscow:     Political Opposition 
- Beijing:    Mai-Mai 
 
3. (U) Other important posts were distributed in the 
following manner: 
 
- Brussels Embassy: PPRD 
- Brussels Consulate: MLC 
- Ottawa: RCD-G 
- Berlin: Civil Society 
- Rome: Political Opposition 
 
4. (C) Among African posts, it is significant that Lusaka, 
site of the accords that gave birth to the power sharing 
agreement establishing the current transitional government, 
was given to the RCD-G. However, this was balanced with the 
MLC receiving Luanda. The PPRD retained the important posting 
in Pretoria which will see increased activity as South Africa 
pursues increased economic, commercial and security ties with 
the DRC. 
 
5. (C) The RCD-G wanted to open the posts of career 
ambassadors to political appointments. However, FonMin Ghonda 
of the MLC as well as the PPRD resisted these attempts. This 
is a positive step as it will ensure that experienced 
diplomats will continue to serve and rotate to different 
postings. At this point it is unclear whether President 
Kabila will keep current DRC Ambassador in Washington, Faida 
Mutifu, in place.

COMMENT 
------- 
4. (C) For all the delay and internal wrangling (in all 
camps) over this reshuffle, the final reshuffle was minor. 
MLC chief Jean-Pierre Bemba may axe Foreign Minister Antoine 
Ghonda in the near future for becoming closer to Kabila than 
he is to Bemba;  the rumored replacement would be Alexis 
Thambwe, who has a reputation for being corrupt but 
intelligent and competent.  Defense Minister Jean-Pierre 
Ondekane of the RCD-Goma fought hard and successfully kept 
his job, despite other RCD-Goma members\' charges that he is 
both incompetent and corrupt.  Also, for all President 
Kabila\'s noise in recent months about combating corruption, 
one of the reportedly most blatant offenders--Mines Minister 
Eugene Diomi Ndongala--has managed to stay in the game.  END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT: DEPARTING BELGIAN AMBASSADOR\'S TOUR D\'HORIZON WITH 
CHARGE 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C)  During TDY Charge Gerald Scott\'s July 9 courtesy call 
on outgoing Belgian Ambassador Renier Nyskens, Nyskens 
stressed the need to maintain cohesion within the 
International Committee to Assist the Transition (CIAT) as 
many senior members will be rotating this summer and some 
elements within (and without) the transition government could 
see this an opportunity to create daylight between CIAT 
members to advance their positions.  Most importantly, the 
international community must continue its proactive 
solidarity. 
 
2. (S)  Looking to the future, Nyskens mused that although 
several months ago President Kabila was widely considered the 
potential hands-down winner, if elections were held today he 
would be humiliated.  Indeed, he would be wise promptly to 
declare that he has no intention of running, lest his 
opponents begin to more actively exploit his four potentially 
crippling factors (age (only 33, he likely will be declared 
too young to run for office), association with some of the 
Kisangani massacre perpetrators, dubious parentage (the 
mother issue) and increasing corruption).  Taking Kabila out 
of the picture, however, leaves a vacuum and nature, 
particularly Congolese nature, abhors a vacuum.  A 
post-Kabila-candidacy DRC will encourage military aspirations 
to power (via coup) and will feed national instability such 
as we are already seeing in the East and as regional power 
players move to strengthen their positions.  Nyskens said 
that his Embassy has been studying the question of \"if not 
Kabila, then who?\" and has not been able to produce a single 
candidate who was popular, had the necessary military support 
and did not suffer from a reputation for debilitating 
corruption or other unfortunate history.  The MLC\'s Olivier 
Kamitatu is a possibility somewhere down the road -- he is 
popular, intelligent, capable, and not considered corrupt -- 
and Cleophas Kamitatu\'s generosity in officially recognizing 
and adopting the son of his wife and her Belgian chauffeur 
presumably eliminates the possibility that Kamitatu\'s 
parentage could be held against him, a la Kabila.  The 
danger, however, is that VP Bemba would have Kamitatu killed 
if he perceived him as a genuine threat to his position, so 
Kamitatu needs sheltering for a while.  Another possible 
candidate (but again in the future, not in this election) 
would be the MLC\'s Secretary General, Thomas Luhaka. 
 
3. (S)  Responding to Scott\'s reminiscences about actors in 
the Mobutu period, Nyskens noted that a number of Congo\'s 
former political power players have continued to agitate for 
a role in the transition -- and post-transition as well.  The 
Ambassador said the three we mentioned (Minister of 
Scientific Research Kamanda Wa Kamanda, former Prime Minister 
Kengo wa Dondo, and Monseignor Monsengwo) were generally 
deemed unacceptable by the Belgians -- though they might have 
some temporary role, well short of their aspirations. Of the 
three, Monsengwo is perhaps the most successful, having just 
been elected to head the Congolese Episcopal Conference, 
although Nyskens added that Monsengwo won this honor (for the 
third time) mostly because the Cardinal is almost completely 
crippled by debilitating diabetes.  Nyskens also said that 
the Vatican has made clear to Monsengwo that he should limit 
his grasping for a role, not least since the Church would be 
deeply embarrassed should Monsengwo\'s \"second family\" living 
in Belgium become public knowledge. 
 
4. (C)  Comment:  The Belgians remain perhaps the most astute 
and well-informed of all Congo watchers, and Nyskens, who has 
been particularly well connected, will be missed.  He has a 
penchant, however, for firm pronouncements on Congolese 
developments that are not always borne out. We share his 
basic assessment that Kabila has been weakened as a 
presidential candidate, but believe it is too soon to 
handicap the eventual electoral field.  Indeed, Nyskens\'s own 
comment that absent Kabila there are few viable and 
supportable options suggests that it is premature to write 
Kabila\'s political obituary.  Recent abortive coup attempts 
and even the trouble in the east could reflect a growing 
perception among Congolese power players that Kabila is 
weakening.  If so, we can expect more frequent and more 
serious tests of his authority in coming months.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Following up on earlier discussions, MONUC 
and member states on July 13 set up a committee on Security 
Sector Reform (SSR).  The committee includes representatives 
from the GDRC plus MONUC, the World Bank, and major 
embassies; it will meet monthly to coordinate donor efforts 
and assist the GDRC with planning and implementing SSR.  The 
committee is potentially useful mechanism for coordinating 
donor activities (a problem in the past) and spurring the 
GDRC to action.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Setting up the Committee 
------------------------ 
2. (U) MONUC SRSG William Swing convened on July 13 the first 
meeting of a Security Sector Reform (SSR) Coordination 
Committee, as discussed at SSR meetings in New York in 
February and June 2004.  This committee will meet monthly to 
coordinate donor efforts and assist the GDRC in planning and 
implementing security reform.  It will focus on three areas: 
police reform, military integration, and Disarmament, 
Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR).  Initial committee 
members include the GDRC, U.S., UK, EU, France, Belgium, 
Canada, Sweden, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Germany, South 
Africa, Angola, MONUC, and World Bank.  A separate, 
working-level group composed of the same member countries and 
organizations will meet weekly, and MONUC will create a small 
SSR cell, which will act as the committee\'s secretariat.

director) and Daniel Kawata (head of the national DDR 
commission), represented the GDRC at this first meeting. 
Boshab said police and military integration are the GDRC\'s 
top priorities, and hoped the committee would help combat 
rumors and avoid duplication of effort.  In future, he 
explained, the defense and interior ministers would attend. 
 
Next Steps 
---------- 
4. (SBU) MONUC\'s Deputy SRSG, Behrooz Sadry, asked committee 
members to designate their working-group representatives by 
July 15.  He suggested that the initial agenda include 
explanations of each member\'s current activities and 
agreements, a discussion of how to coordinate them, and an 
update from Kawata on the status of national DDR planning. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) The committee is a potentially useful mechanism for 
coordinating donor activities.  Currently, the GDRC\'s major 
partners on security-sector reform issues are Belgium, 
France, Angola, South Africa, MONUC and the EU.  The French, 
EU, and MONUC are all focused on police training; 
information-sharing and coordination is not such a problem 
there.  The Belgians, South Africans and Angolans, however, 
have a track record of \"doing their own thing\" security-wise 
in the Congo, and mutual rivalry (if not suspicion) is strong. 
 
6. (C) Ideally, the committee would also serve as a means of 
putting pressure on the GDRC to plan and begin to implement 
real military integration.  Boshab\'s attendance at the 
opening meeting was a good sign and indicates high-level 
participation, though it remains to be seen who will 
represent the GDRC at future meetings.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: RCD TO FIRE EIGHT DISSIDENT PARLIAMENTARIANS 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  Eight RCD parliamentarians, citing numerous 
government failings including tolerance of ethnic hatred, 
declared they will not participate in parliament.  A senior 
RCD official in Goma sympathized, saying \"most people\" in the 
Kivus agree with their views.  A top RCD official in 
Kinshasa, however, said that after their declaration the RCD 
leadership decided to replace all eight in parliament, and 
will probably exclude them from the party.  RCD leaders 
appear to think few will join this political \"mutiny.\"  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
\"We Quit...for Now\" 
------------------- 
2. (U) Eight Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie (RCD) 
members of parliament, Rwandophones all, announced from Goma 
on July 13 that they are suspending their participation in 
the transitional government.  (Note:  The RCD has 94 seats in 
the National Assembly.  End Note.)  The most prominent of 
these is Bizima Karaha, foreign minister under Laurent Kabila 
and later head of the RCD\'s internal-security service.  The 
group announced its decision in a 14-page communique, which 
warns that the peace process and transitional government are 
in danger of collapsing, and charges that: 
 
--top GDRC officials are deliberately fostering ethnic hatred 
toward Tutsis, in the Kivus and in Kinshasa;  other 
transitional government figures including President Joseph 
Kabila tolerate this 
 
--in May-June 2004, South Kivu military region commander Gen. 
Mbuza Mabe carried out selective assassinations of Tutsis in 
Bukavu;  elsewhere, Tutsi military personnel are being 
singled out, detained, and in many instances killed because 
of their ethnicity 
 
--\"parallel structures\" answering to Kabila\'s personal 
military staff are actively supporting the ex-FAR/Interahamwe 
in the Kivus;  at least 60 percent of the government troops 
being deployed to eastern Congo are ex-FAR/Interahamwe 
 
The authors go on to make a number of demands, including 
withdrawal of the 10,000-strong \"expeditionary corps\" of 
government troops sent to the east; a \"pause\" in the 
transition, to take stock and adopt new policies; appointment 
of an apolitical, technocratic administration to run the 
country until elections can be held; physical elimination of 
the ex-FAR/Interahamwe; and changing the revenue-sharing 
formula between Kinshasa and the provinces from 90/10 to 
60/40. 
 
 
RCD South Kivu Official Expresses Sympathy 
------------------------------------------ 
3. (C) South Kivu vice-governor Thomas Nziratimana told 
poloff July 14 that if RCD leaders in Kinshasa \"mishandle\" 
the situation, they risk splitting the RCD as a party. 
(Note:  He is a Tutsi, reportedly a cousin of RCD president 
Azarias Ruberwa, and the former RCD representative in 
Pretoria.  He is currently in Goma, staying at Karaha\'s 
house.  End Note.)  \"We on the ground\" agree with most of the 
group\'s complaints, he said.  Many are greatly disappointed 
with the process, and \"the hatred in Kinshasa is deep.\" 
People will not hesitate to split with the RCD \"if need be,\" 
he added.  Nziratimana said that one of the grievances listed 
in the communique dealt with his own (biological) younger 
brother.  The brother, Captain Didier Busohoka, was based in 
a remote area, and \"when there were problems,\" left with 
three bodyguards for the town of Salamabila.  Government 
troops arrested him on charges of attempting to seize the 
airfield there, and brought him to Kindu, where he is 
currently being detained under difficult conditions. 
Nziratimana said he had personally spoken with the overall 
Ground Forces Commander, Gen. Sylvain Mbuki, but was unable 
to secure his brother\'s release or guarantee better 
treatment.  (Comment:  Mbuki was the RCD\'s top military 
officer when the transtional government started up, but 
Nziratimana and other RCD officials in recent months have 
privately accused Mbuki of selling out to Kabila.  End 
Comment.) 
 
 
Senior RCD Official in Kinshasa:  \"They\'re Out!\" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
4. (C) Senate 1st Vice President Emile Ilunga told poloff 
that senior RCD leaders decided on July 14 to designate new 
parliamentarians to replace Karaha\'s group, and will probably 
exclude them from the party. The RCD\'s collective leadership, 
the \"College des Fondateurs,\" had previously decided that 
Karaha and the others were spending too much time in Goma 
rather than at work in Kinshasa, especially with important 
legislation on nationality and amnesty coming up.  The RCD 
asked them to choose, sent an ultimatum demanding that they 
return to Kinshasa, but instead Karaha\'s group responded by 
communique.  Karaha\'s group, Ilunga said, has long been 
trying to destabilize the Kivus and undermine RCD leaders in 
Kinshasa.  \"They never belonged to the process,\" he 
explained.  When the RCD was based in Goma, Karaha and his 
entourage were powerful.  They lost this preeminence with the 
advent of the transitional government, and no longer hold 
important positions.  In short, they are \"very frustrated\" 
and did everything they could to make the process 
fail--including actively support the mutinous Gen. Laurent 
Nkunda. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) It is unclear whether or not Karaha will be able to 
recruit many others to his \"cause.\"  RCD leaders appear to 
think not, as their response to this political \"mutiny\" has 
been firm.  It stands in marked contrast to their 
unwillingness to publicly condemn renegade military officers 
Gen. Laurent Nkunda and Col. Jules Mutebusi.  END COMMENT.

Classified By: Poloff Meghan Moore for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary: As of July 15, it is unclear whether ongoing 
negotiation attempts will end the stalemate with rebel 
commander Laurent Nkunda without a return to open conflict. 
Sustained rumors of an imminent FARDC attack on rebel 
positions in N. and S. Kivu have circulated for several 
weeks. As of July 15, however, the FARDC had not made a firm 
decision to start the offensive, and a number of diplomatic 
initiatives were still underway. Nkunda\'s poor negotiation 
history could provide the proximate cause for a serious GDRC 
offensive on Kalehe or Minova. Post will continue to monitor 
closely the fluid situation. End summary. 
 
2. (C) Consistent, sustained rumors of an imminent FARDC 
attack on rebel positions in N. and S. Kivu have circulated 
for several weeks. As of July 15, however, the FARDC had not 
made a firm decision to start the offensive, and a number of 
diplomatic initiatives by the GDRC and the international 
community were still underway. In addition to recent talks in 
Brussels and ongoing talks in Washington, on July 9, 
Presidential Security Advisor Samba Kaputo told Charge that 
the GDRC would only use force if negotiations fail. On July 
12, Nkunda told a MONUC delegation that he was not formally 
negotiating with the GDRC, but was in regular contact with 
old RCD/G associates. (Note: There are credible rumors that 
N. Kivu governor Eugene Serufuli may be negotiating with 
Nkunda on behalf of President Kabila. End note.) 
 
MONUC-Nkunda Meeting 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C) On July 12, MONUC Kivus Brigade Commander Jan Isberg 
and Head of Office Alpha Sow met with Nkunda in Minova, S. 
Kivu to discuss peacefully ending the stalemate, and 
investigating an alleged July 10 attack by Nkunda\'s forces on 
S. Kivu FARDC troops, allegations of child soldier 
recruitment, illegal taxation and harassment of civilians. 
Over the past few weeks, Nkunda has presented an unreasonable 
laundry list of demands to be met before he and his 
compatriot, Jules Mutebusi, would consider exile from the DRC 
for a to-be-determined length of time. These requests have 
included: 
--amnesty for those convicted of the LD Kabila assassination 
--amnesty for all involved in recent fighting in the Kivus 
--the removal of General Mabe from the S. Kivu military 
region and prosecution for targeting Banyamulenge in early 
June 
--an investigation into the Banyamulenge genocide 
--reparations for Banyamulenge who were killed, fled to 
Rwanda, or were looted 
--integration, \'with honor,\' of Nkunda\'s and Mutebusi\'s 
troops into the FARDC. 
 
At the MONUC meeting, he presented two demands--- a thorough 
investigation by the transition government into crimes 
committed against the Banyamulenge and General Mabe\'s actions 
in early June, and to be able to peacefully return to Goma. 
He said he would not accept a military assignment outside the 
Kivus. 
 
4. (C) Nkunda told the MONUC delegation that he had nothing 
to do with the July 10 attempted flanking attack on S. Kivu 
FARDC forces southwest of Kalehe in the Bushaka/Lemera area. 
He said he thought the attackers might have been local 
defense forces from the Nyabibwe area (a village located 
between Minova and Kalehe) or N. Kivu forces \'hunting the 
FDLR/Interahamwe.\' Nkunda said he would not rule out 
attacking Bukavu or Goma, in part because he found General 
Obed\'s (N. Kivu military regional commander) orders to arrest 
him if he entered Goma unacceptable. (Note: On July 14, 
General Obed confirmed to poloff that he had been instructed 
by the FARDC hierarchy to issue an arrest warrant for Nkunda, 
would arrest him if he entered Goma, and was ready for an 
Nkunda-led attack against the city. End note.) A MONUC Child 
Protection Officer who participated in the meeting told 
polcouns that Nkunda was \'irrational\' throughout the meeting. 
 
Marching Towards Renewed Conflict? 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Although eastward troop movements have slowed, 
advanced planning for an offensive in eastern DRC continues, 
supplies continue to move east, and troops continue to move 
between eastern garrisons. As of July 12, many military 
observers believed that the FARDC needed to attack before 
payday on July 30, and before its soldiers become demoralized 
and desert or start widescale looting and harassment of 
civilians. As of July 12, the FARDC reportedly had a plan of 
attack. However, on July 13, a MONUC official told polcouns 
that the FARDC 10th military region G-3 (Intelligence) 
officer forgot his briefcase with FARDC battle plans for the 
offensive in a car while he went into a bar outside Kalehe 
the night of July 12. When he came out, his briefcase was 
missing. At a minimum, the G-3 was imprisoned by the FARDC, 
and may have been killed. 
 
6. (C) On July 14, General Mabe told MONUC Bukavu that 
fighting had broken out, but later revised his story to say 
only that he had sent a mixed group of about 500 GSSP, MLC 
and Mai Mai troops north from Bukavu towards Kalehe. He said 
these soldiers went as far north as the N./ S. Kivu border 
without meeting resistance and stopped. There were also 
unconfirmed reports of an unknown number of troops loyal to 
Nkunda retreating from Kalehe towards Minova (north of Kalehe 
and south of Goma) or Masisi (northwest of Kalehe). On July 
13, about 10 small boats and attendant troops from the Navy 
arrived in Bukavu from Mbandaka to prevent attacks and/or 
resupply from Rwanda across Lake Kivu. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) As of July 15, it is unclear whether ongoing 
negotiation attempts will end the Nkunda stalemate without a 
return to open conflict. FARDC\'s limited deployment which 
stopped short of entering N. Kivu may have been a warning 
shot to encourage Nkunda to seek a real, negotiated 
settlement, and a thinly veiled threat against N. Kivu 
Governor Serufuli and General Obed to get Nkunda under 
control before Kinshasa does. Nkunda\'s increasingly 
irrational behavior and past refusals to negotiate in good 
faith could render negotiation attempts useless, increase 
tension, and provide the proximate cause for a serious, GDRC 
offensive on Kalehe or Minova. Post will continue to monitor 
closely the fluid situation.

REF: KAMPALA IIR 6 913 0577 04 
 
Classified By: Poloff Gons Nachman for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary. Fighting between FAPC and FNI militias in 
Ituri has continued into a second week resulting in hundreds 
of IDPs and an undetermined number of refugees. The conflict 
has been fueled by apparent efforts to control a gold mine 
and the perception that MONUC\'s and the GDRC\'s attention and 
resources have shifted to the Kivus.  End Summary. 
 
FAPC Takes Advantage of MONUC\'s Decreased Strength in Ituri 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2. (C) Militias from the Popular Armed Forces of the Congo 
(FAPC) and the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) 
have continued their fighting in the Mahagi area of Ituri for 
a second week. UNHCR\'s representative for the DRC, David 
Kapya, returned from an assessment mission to Mahagi on July 
12. Poloff spoke with him the same day about the security 
situation. Kapya said that fighting between FAPC, led by 
commander Jerome Kakawave, and the FNI, nominally led by 
Floribert Njabu, continued on Sunday even as Kapya met with 
MONUC Nepalese peacekeepers in Mahagi. It is estimated that 
over 50 militias and 4 civilians have died as a result of the 
fighting. 
 
3. (C) According to a MONUC Nepalese Colonel in Mahagi, 
Jerome provoked FNI into fighting after sending some of his 
men to harass Lendu women in a market. After FNI responded, 
FAPC took the opportunity to challenge FNI\'s control of the 
gold mine near Jalasiga. FAPC also appears interested in 
taking control of Mahagi port on Lake Albert. Although the 
local population wants MONUC to use its Chapter VII authority 
to stop the fighting, the Nepalese peacekeepers have so far 
stayed out of the conflict. 
 
4. (C) Kapya explained that MONUC has less than 600 
peacekeepers in Mahagi and approximately 2,000 in all of 
Ituri (Note: According to MONUC\'s General Rashad, this 
decreased presence is due to a company of peacekeepers having 
been sent to Bukavu, one to Kinshasa, and one that has yet to 
arrive from Kisangani. End Note.) Moreover, due to the 
current focus on the Kivus, MONUC only has one attack 
helicopter in Bunia. Jerome, by contrast, is estimated to 
have over 3,000 well-armed fighters. It is also alleged that 
some of Jerome\'s commanding officers are Rwandans, including 
a Colonel Ndayisaba. Additionally, MONUC reported that prior 
to, and during the conflict, FNI and FAPC leaders have been 
seen frequently in Arua and Kampala allegedly seeking support 
from Ugandan generals. (Comment: Ugandan MOD made clear 
recently (reftel) it does not intend to intervene, but 
expects MONUC to do more to quell the fighting. End Comment.) 
 
5. (C) The ongoing conflict between FAPC and FNI militias has 
also called into question DDR plans for Ituri. FNI militias 
have now said that they will not disarm unless all other 
groups do the same simultaneously. UNDP teams and NGOs 
preparing implementation of the Ituri plan have also been 
disrupted by the insecurity and have been unable to travel to 
the proposed demobilization sites. 
 
 
Fighting Results in IDPs and Refugees 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Kapya said that hundreds of people had been internally 
displaced as a result of the fighting, with the majority of 
IDPs moving towards Mahagi and Kpwandroma. Six hundred IDPs 
had been reported to gather at a Catholic Church to ask for 
assistance only to be told that there was none. Very little 
humanitarian assistance is currently available in Mahagi and 
insecurity has prevented Bunia-based NGOs from delivering aid. 
 
7. (C) Kapya indicated that UNHCR Kampala was investigating 
allegations of Congolese refugees crossing into Uganda. 
However, at this point there are only unconfirmed reports 
that 2,000 civilians may have crossed from Mahagi. He noted 
that due to ongoing instability in Ituri, UNHCR would not be 
able to repatriate in the near future the 12,000 Congolese 
refugees that remain in Uganda, most of whom come from the 
area of Boga, currently controlled by FNI militia. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Jerome appears to be taking advantage of MONUC\'s focus 
on the Kivus and its diminished strength in Ituri to pursue 
economic interests in Mahagi. Fighting is likely to continue, 
along with the displacement of civilians for as long as MONUC 
and the GDRC are seen as maintaining a hands-off attitude 
towards the conflict.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 1.6X6

SUBJECT: UK AMBASSADOR\'S FAREWELL VIEWS 
 
 
1.)  Summary :  HMG is reviewing its policy towards the DRC, 
taking into account the UN Ambassador\'s view that President 
Kabila and the hard-liners around him have no real desire, 
protestations to the contrary, to see any transition take 
place that threatens their long-term power and access to the 
country\'s riches.  The Ambassador believes Kabila needs to 
hear a clear undivided message from the major members of the 
concerned international community to the effect that his 
current path is dangerous and will not receive our support. 
End Summary 
 
2. (C)  I paid an initial call on outgoing British Ambassador 
James Atkinson on July 8th.  He gave me  some of the elements 
of his end-of-tour assessment of policy towards the DRC--none 
of it positive. 
 
3.  (S)     Atkinson said that HMG and the other western 
donors (and HMG has an aid budget for the DRC this year of 70 
million dollars) had been led astray by the protestations of 
the current government.  There is, in fact, no desire for 
serious reform, or any real transition--at least one that 
would threaten their position.  Instead, they are determined 
to hold on to power and keep their access to what money they 
can.  In this respect it does not differ much from the days 
of Mobutu and, of course, many of the same people (or their 
sons) are in place now. 
 
4.  (C)  Joseph Kabila  is surrounded by hard-liners using 
him as a front.  The young man does not have his father,s 
occasionally brutal leadership style (and the DRC needs a 
forceful hand), but serves the interest of those who 
(probably) killed his father.  None of these want a 
successful transition to what would pass for a democratic 
system with the exception of the RCD.  These latter want to 
stay in power no less than the rest, but having no local 
ethnic base, depend on a reasonably successful transition to 
maintain their position here.  Otherwise, it is back to the 
East and to whatever can be salvaged of their position there. 
 
5. (C)  Kabila is also trying to assure that he remains as 
the only contender left with real military muscle.  He uses 
the \"Maison Militaire\" to go around the Ministry of Defense 
and while the troops belonging to other factions decay, the 
FAC under his command maintain a relatively advantageous 
situation. 
 
6. (C)  I asked who he could identify as the chief hardliners 
in the Kabila entourage.  He cited Katumba Mwabe (A Bemba 
from Katanga, he is a former governor of Katanga, former 
Minister of the Presidency and currently 
Ambassador-at-large), Mwense Kongolo (A Luba from Katanga, he 
is a former Minister of Justice under Laurent Kabila and 
Minister of Security under Joseph Kabila--from which he was 
suspended in October 2002 after unfavorable mention in the UN 
Panel report on illegal exploitation of Congolese 
resources.),  and  Gen. John Numbi.   He noted that all of 
these were Katangans.  Other hard-liners included Samba 
Kaputo (National Security Advisor.  From one of the smaller 
tribes in Katanga,  but he grew up in the Kasais.  He was 
Governor of Orientale Province under Mobutu.) and Evariste 
Boshab  (Kabila\'s Chief of Staff). 
 
7.  (C)  These have the support of Vice-President Bemba and 
his crowd.  Bemba does not want to be president; he just 
wants to keep his hands in the till. 
 
8. (C)  Atkinson said that FCO was sending a paper to Cabinet 
arguing that the presumptions on which UK support for the 
Kabila government were no longer supportable.  There was a 
need to be clear about the situation and the direction in 
which the DRC was being taken.  He agreed that any approach, 
to have any hope of success, needed to be a concerted Western 
effort.  I asked who he thought shared his views.  He replied 
he thought his analysis would not be rejected by most of the 
major embassies here, but said that the World Bank seemed 
happy to be shelling out the cash. 
 
9. (C)  What would a change mean?  The DRC leadership needed 
to be called to order-- diplomatically, of course.  (There is 
a strong Congolese sensitivity to criticism that could result 
in a counterproductive reaction if given an excuse.)  I 
gather that HMG may, if the paper is approved, be arguing 
this position shortly. 
 
10. (C)  Comment:  Atkinson is prone to overstating, or 
dramatizing, events, as was the case when he excitedly 
declared the March 28 security incident in Kinshasa a coup. 
His due assessment of the state of play reflects this 
tendency.   We agree-and have reported-that there are strains 
in the Transitional government, including the use of 
hard-liners around President Kabila.  However, we believe 
that, at least so far, Kabila remains able to balance these 
elements and remains committed to elections - elections which 
apparently he believes he can win.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  SRSG William Swing says MONUC needs more 
troops, and that UNSYG Kofi Annan is likely to support such a 
request.  According to a mid-level MONUC source, the 
organization plans to ask for an additional 25,000 troops, 
increasing the annual cost to an estimated $2.2bn.  The 
source said UN authorities in New York oppose such a large 
increase and think MONUC should focus on its core tasks, but 
MONUC officials have something closer to \"maximalist\" views. 
Swing is a realist, therefore we think his likely goal is to 
reach 15-18,000 troops, enough to strengthen the Kivus and 
Ituri brigades, the Neutral Force in Kinshasa, and give MONUC 
a rapid-reaction force.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Swing:  \"We Need More Troops\" 
----------------------------- 
2. (C) Emboffs met with MONUC SRSG William Swing on July 8, 
to deliver talking points reftel.  According to Swing, 
although his mission\'s mandate has expanded during the past 
year, its resources have not.  Recent fighting in the Kivus 
demonstrated that MONUC cannot handle two crises at once. 
UNSYG Kofi Annan is likely to support a MONUC request for 
additional troops and police trainers, he said, in order to 
\"avoid having to lower Congolese and international 
expectations of MONUC.\"  Swing did not give specifics on the 
additional forces MONUC might request. 
 
 
New York, MONUC Debate Size/Tasks 
--------------------------------- 
3. (C) A mid-level MONUC source told poloff July 16 that 
MONUC military staff drafted a \"very unrealistic\" plan that 
asks for 25,000 additional troops, raising the mission\'s 
annual cost to an estimated $2.2 billion.  (Note:  MONUC\'s 
current authorized troop strength is 10,800.  End note.) New 
York opposes so large an increase, and thinks MONUC should 
focus on essential peacekeeping tasks only.  MONUC senior 
leaders, however, want to take something closer to a 
\"maximalist\" approach;  the 25,000 requested increase is 
sincere, it is not simply a bargaining position.  Speculating 
on MONUC leaders\' thinking, the source said that many in the 
mission had previously served in Kosovo, and \"don\'t realize 
they\'re no longer in the Balkans.\"  Another factor is simply 
bureaucratic inertia and the tendency for organizational 
empire-building. 
 
4. (SBU) The source confirmed that a team from DPKO arrived 
in Kinshasa July 15, to help prepare the Secretary-General\'s 
report on MONUC to the Security Council.  (Note:  DATT met 
with the team on July 15, and will report septel.  End note.) 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) Swing is a realist, therefore we find it unlikely he 
himself seriously expects to triple MONUC\'s strength.  A more 
likely goal is to reach 15-18,000 troops, enough to 
strengthen the Kivus and Ituri brigades, the Neutral Force in 
Kinshasa, and give MONUC a rapid-reaction force.  In our 
view, the additional troops are necessary, but it is even 
more important for MONUC leaders to address long-standing 
problems such as poor internal communications, weak 
management in key field offices, and widely-differing levels 
of ability and motivation among the various troop contingents 
(see ref\'s C and D).  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NORTH AND SOUTH KIVU CONTINUE MOSTLY CALM 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  Recent shifts in Congolese military 
deployments bringing these forces closer to Minova and Goma 
seem to have lent impetus to ongoing negotiations with rebel 
commander Nkunda, who now says that he is willing to go into 
exile if a recipient country can be found. Initial press 
reports that civilians were \"fleeing\" Goma due to Nkunda\'s 
purported arrival apparently were overstated, as the NGO 
community reports that only some families with relations in 
Bukavu have gone to that city. All the eastern military 
regional commanders, with the exception of Obed from N. Kivu, 
are in Kinshasa for meetings at the Ministry of Defense, and 
expect to meet with President Kabila this evening.  It seems 
likely that they have covered the battle plan, suggesting 
that a military operation could begin shortly if the Nkunda 
talks fail.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Talking With The Enemy 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C)  Both N. Kivu governor Eugene Serufuli and S. Kivu 
governor Augustin Bulahimu told PolCouns July 19 that 
negotiations with rebel general Nkunda have taken on a new 
life, with Nkunda apparently now insisting on his willingness 
to go into exile if an appropriate site can be found. 
Bulahimu said he believes this new interest in negotiating is 
due to the movement over the weekend of some FADRC forces 
closer to Minova, where Nkunda is based.  Serufuli said that 
he personally had already spoken twice on July 19 with RCD VP 
Azarias Ruberwa, who, Serufuli said, is working closely with 
the Presidency to try to find an acceptable peaceful end to 
the existing stalemate.  (Comment:  We heard from other 
sources that Belgian efforts to convince the South Africans 
to take Nkunda and fellow rebel Mutebusi have failed.  South 
Africa was the most likely exile site, and indeed, we have 
not heard that Nkunda is actually willing to go anywhere 
else.  End Comment.) 
 
----------------------------- 
Preparing the Military Option 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C)  Monuc Bukavu confirmed that a mixed brigade (composed 
of MLC, GSSP and Mai Mai elements) moved up from Bukavu to 
the very edge of the military district, near Minova, on 
Friday evening, and speculated that this movement was 
intended as a \"final warning\" to Nkunda and others.  Contrary 
to rumors, however, the FADRC forces in Beni and Kindu have 
not yet begun mobilizing for action, and most of the FADRC 
forces in S. Kivu are still in Bukavu.  All the eastern 
regional military commanders (with the exception of N. Kivu 
commander Obed who was invited but declined to attend) are 
currently in Kinshasa, attending briefings at the MOD and 
awaiting a meeting with President Kabila.  (Note:  The 
Presidential meeting could take place this evening.  End 
Note.)  S. Kivu commander Mabe is planning to remain in 
Kinshasa until Friday, July 23.  (Comment:  MLC General 
Bahume, who was sent to Bukavu to help coordinate the 
military movement, is also in Kinshasa for these meetings but 
reportedly will return to Bukavu tomorrow or Wednesday.  End 
Comment.) 
 
------------------ 
Civilian Movements 
------------------ 
 
4. (C)  Following press reports that hundreds of civilians 
were fleeing Goma in fear following Nkunda\'s threat to attack 
the city, we checked with Monuc and NGO sources, who report 
that while some families who have relatives in Bukavu are 
traveling to Bukavu, there is no mass exodus from the city. 
This was confirmed by both Kivus governors (the S. Kivu 
governor is in Goma negotiating the return of Banyamulenge 
refugees who fled there during the fighting in Bukavu). 
Bulahimu, in fact, is hopeful that sometime this week a 
couple of hundred Banyamulenge displaced from their homes 
will return to Bukavu under his personal protection.  He also 
said that his RCD deputy, Thomas Nanzamatarata, who had 
previously refused to take up his duties, will also accompany 
him back to Bukavu today.  (Comment\"  This would be a 
positive step, as it would signal that Nanzamatarata had 
dropped some or all of his demands, such as the immediate 
suspension of military commander Mabe.  End Comment.) 
Serufuli cautioned PolCouns, however, that the Rwandaphone 
community in N. Kivu is feeling \"threatened\" by the approach 
of Mabe\'s troops and by rumors that the FADRC troops in Beni 
and Kindu soon could move toward Goma.  Serufuli pointed to 
the dubious reputation of Mabe\'s troops as cause for concern 
(note: some of Mabe\'s men allegedly killed Munyamulenge 
civilians in Bukavu before the fighting broke out there), and 
said that although he is doing his best to calm the 
situation, there could be a significant IDP fallout if the 
government troops move any closer to Kalehe or if fighting 
breaks out. 
 
------ 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C)  Events underway for the last few weeks seem now to be 
converging.  The meeting of the regional military commanders 
suggests that the long-delayed military action could begin 
soon, possibly even this weekend, if the talks with Nkunda 
fail, as they seem destined to do.  N. Kivu commander Obed\'s 
refusal to come to Kinshasa sends a bad signal, at best, and 
at worst could flag his decision to oppose the advance 
through N. Kivu of the FADRC troops.  Doing so would, of 
course, effectively cast his lot with the rebels and, by 
extension, would also place Serufuli in the same camp. This 
could provoke the worst-case scenario in which the government 
forces do indeed attack Goma, with all the attendant 
possibilities for disaster which we already have considered. 
We will continue to monitor the situation closely in an 
attempt to determine the most likely governmental course of 
action.

SUBJECT: KINSHASA - GLOBAL SECURITY ASSESSMENT 
 
REF: STATE 151051 
 
Classified By: RSO JEFF LISCHKE.  REASON 1.4 (G). 
 
1.  (U)  The following from RSO are Kinshasa\'s responses to 
reftel subparagraphs A-L: 
 
A.  (C)  Physical Security Upgrades - Official Facilities: 
(2) Program is necessary, generally effective, can be updated 
to mitigate vulnerabilities.  Kinshasa completed a major 
physical security upgrade project at the Chancery and the 
Joint Administrative Office (JAO) in April of 2002 which 
greatly improved the physical security at both compounds. 
With the involvement of the Ambassador, we also received 
permission to close off Dongo Street which runs along the 
west side of the Chancery and Avenue des Aviateurs which is 
the street located directly in front of the Chancery.  Our 
most vulnerable point is the south-east portion of the 
Chancery where Avenue des Aviateurs passes in front of the 
Portuguese Embassy and then within 8 feet of the perimeter 
wall and 20 feet of the Embassy building.  The Ambassador, 
DCM and RSO met with the mayor of Kinshasa on several 
occasions and requested permission to close off this portion 
of Aviateurs with negative results.  Before approaching the 
Mayor of Kinshasa, we received approval from the Portuguese 
to close off Ave. des Aviateurs in front of their Embassy and 
have a shared vehicle control point.  However, without 
permission from the local government we are unable to do 
this.  Another vulnerability at the Chancery is the Consular 
Section.  After the 1998 bombings and the push for 
co-location, the Consular Section moved from the USAID 
building onto the Embassy compound in early 2000 without 
receiving permission from DS.  During an IG inspection in 
2002, the number one recommendation of the IG was to renovate 
the Consular Section building to make it more secure and 
efficient.  OBO provided funding but DS is holding up the 
funds because a waiver package to co-locate was never 
submitted.  We recently submitted the waiver package and are 
looking forward to a favorable response from DS so the 
project can move forward and address the numerous security 
vulnerabilities the Consular Section currently has.  We also 
requested during the physical upgrade project to have the 
mechanical/hydraulic drop arm located inside the Embassy 
compound moved to the initial vehicle checkpoint on Dongo 
street but were told we could not do it.  More Embassy 
employees park on Dongo street than inside of the compound so 
in our opinion in makes much more sense to have the 
mechanical barrier located on Dongo street and the manual one 
located inside the Embassy compound. 
 
(C)  The JAO compound, located approximately .8 kms west of 
the Embassy, is relatively secure but does not meet the 
setback requirement in the south and south-west portion of 
the main building.  All administrative functions of the 
Embassy are located at JAO - Admin, B&F, GSO, FM, Motor Pool, 
etc.  The Public Affairs Library also does not meet the 
setback standard.  The CAC\'s and vehicle checkpoints meet DS 
standards and we feel relatively good about the security at 
JAO other than the lack of setback issue. 
 
(C)  The USAID compound is located .4 kms from the Embassy in 
a commercial office space that also has 7 apartments.   USAID 
completed a major physical security upgrade project in the 
spring of 2003 and installed DS standard drop arms and guard 
booths.  We also installed cement planters that increased the 
setback from approximately 30 feet to 60 feet from the main 
street.  One of the most noticeable and disturbing 
vulnerabilities of the USAID building is the uncontrolled 
access to a junk yard/mechanic shop located directly behind 
the facility on the eastern side.  USAID has also grown 
substantially.  In July of 2001 there were 5 direct hire 
American employees.  Now there are 16.  The Center of Disease 
Control also moved into this building in the winter of 2002 
and they have 2 American direct hire staff.  The bottom line 
is that USAID and CDC will run out of office space if they 
continue to expand. 
 
(C)  Other than the Consular Section renovation project, we 
do not have any other physical security upgrade projects 
planned in the near future.  The only way to improve the 
security at all three locations would be to close more 
streets which the Congolese Government will not permit us to 
do.  The good news is that we just located a parcel of land 
and received permission from the Department to sign an option 
to buy contract with the owner for a proposed New Embassy 
Compound (NEC) project that is supposed to start in 2008. 
Unless we received permission to 
 
B.  (C)  Chemical/Biological Protection:  Program is 
necessary element of the overall RSO security program at post 
but is ineffective and requires improvement.  We still have 
not received First Responder training.  It has been scheduled 
several times in the past, but has always been canceled. 
That said, we do feel that the threat of a chem/bio attack in 
Kinshasa is low but would still like to receive the training. 
 Our APO facility can be sealed in the event of a chem/bio 
incident and we are looking forward to receiving the Quick 
Mask 2000. 
 
C.  (C)  Technical Security Upgrades:  Program is highly 
relevant, operating effectively, well supported and mitigates 
important vulnerabilities.  As a result of the major physical 
security upgrade project completed in April 2002, we have 
excellent CCTV coverage at the Chancery, JAO and USAID with 
Intellex capability at all except USAID where the video 
recorder and tapes are being utilized.  We have hard-wired 
and remote IDNS capability at both the Chancery and JAO but 
nothing at USAID in spite of several requests to USAID 
Security to address this issue. 
 
D.  (U)  Armored Vehicle Program:  Program is necessary, 
generally effective, can be updated to better mitigate 
important vulnerabilities. In a post like Kinshasa and as 
events of the recent coup and student/population 
demonstrations proved,  lightly and fully armored vehicles 
are a necessity.  During the recent student demonstrations, 
several of the Embassy LAV\'s were struck with rocks, bottles, 
etc. and did not suffer any damage.  We currently have a 
fully armored Suburban for the COM and 10 LAV Suburbans.  We 
do believe that Toyota Landcruisers would be a better option 
in Kinshasa because of the reliability, availability of spare 
parts and fuel consumption. 
 
E.  (U)  Guard Programs:  Program is necessary, generally 
effective, can be updated to better mitigate vulnerabilities. 
 Our contract guard service provided by USDS is excellent in 
spite of the low salaries paid to the guards.  As anyone who 
has served at an Embassy is well aware, the local guards are 
our first line of defense and play a critical role in the 
security of both facilities and residences.  The problem is 
that guards are usually woefully underpaid and receive 
minimal medical and retirement benefits by the guard contract 
companies because they want to maximize their profit margins. 
 I have always been a strong advocate of a FSN/LES guard 
force where the guards work directly for the Embassy so we 
can guarantee a basic salary that is paid on time and ensure 
that the guards receive adequate family medical benefits 
which is paramount for their morale.  How can we expect a 
guard to be loyal to the Embassy and give up his life if he 
feels he is underpaid, receive limited medical benefits and 
are not respected?  Additionally, guards in a post like 
Kinshasa (and many others in Africa), they cannot comprehend 
the fact that they do not work for the Embassy but rather for 
a company that has a contract with the Embassy. 
 
F.  (U)  Surveillance Detection Program:  Program is highly 
relevant, operating effectively, well supported and mitigates 
important vulnerabilities.  Our SD program is effective and 
we feel that it should continue. 
 
G.  (U)  Residential Security:  Program is necessary, 
generally effective, can be updated to better mitigate 
vulnerabilities.  Residential security is critical in 
Kinshasa.  All residences have safehavens alarms that are 
connected to a Central Alarm Monitoring System (CAMS), grills 
on all windows and doors that are reasonably accessible, good 
perimeter security lighting, a perimeter wall with 
concertina/razor wire and 24-hour guards.  As a result, we 
have not experienced one residential break in for several 
years.  I am not sure whether or not SRWF is required for all 
residences.  It is necessary for key officers\' residences, 
but I do not believe that SRWF is necessary on every single 
residential window.  That said, the majority of our 
residences have SRWF and those that do not will have it 
installed. 
 
H.  (U)  Soft Targets:  Program is highly relevant, operating 
effectively, well supported and mitigates important 
vulnerabilities.  I have worked closely with the 
Administrator from The American School of Kinshasa (TASOK) to 
ensure that we took advantage of the funding offered by the 
Department for the different phases of the security upgrade 
programs at Overseas American Schools.  TASOK now has a PA 
system that enables the Administrator to give emergency 
instructions to students throughout the campus and the class 
rooms, a 25 watt mobil radio that enables him to communicate 
effectively with Post # 1 and SRWF on the majority of class 
room and office windows.  Most recently, we requested and 
received $70,000.00 to improve the perimeter wall and place 
concertina/razor wire on the entire wall. 
 
(U)  We do have an issue with security at the Congo American 
Language Institute.  We would like to improve their security 
by adding hard-line doors, a proper screening area and some 
other security upgrades but are having a problem with 
funding.  Is PD or DS responsible for providing funding? 
Please note that there are no Americans who work at the 
facility, but we consider it a soft target. 
 
I.  (U)  Briefing Program:  Program is highly relevant, 
operating effectively, well supported and mitigates important 
vulnerabilities.  We have an excellent briefing program for 
permanent and TDY American personnel, FSN/LES staff and the 
private American community.  We included the checklist sent 
by the DS as a result of the Larry Foley Accountability 
Review Board in our briefing.  We regularly give security 
advice to Embassy personnel at our All American Staff meeting 
that is held every other Friday.  We also brief members of 
the private American community at Town Hall meetings held at 
the Ambassador\'s residence.  We also provide newly hired 
FSN/LES with a security/CI briefings. 
 
J.  (U)  ATA Program:  Program is a necessary element of the 
overall RSO security program at post, but is ineffective and 
requires improvement.  It has been my experience as RSO that 
unless the country you are serving in is on the foreign 
policy map - Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, etc. - there is no 
opportunity to take advantage of this incredible program.  I 
have, however, worked closely with our Public Affairs Officer 
and sent several Congolese Police and Security Officials back 
to the States under the International Visitors (IV) Program. 
 
K.  (U)  Emergency Management Program:  Program is highly 
relevant, operating effectively, well supported and mitigates 
important vulnerabilities.  In a post like Kinshasa that has 
been evacuated 5 times in the last 10 years, emergency 
planning is paramount.  I provide a briefing to all pertinent 
members of the Embassy on their responsibilities in the event 
of an evacuation.  The CLO and I recently held a briefing for 
all Embassy and USAID employees and their dependents on what 
to expect in the event of an evacuation.   Additionally, the 
Crisis Management Exercise (CME) conducted by the Department 
also helps prepare Embassies for crisis situations.  One 
comment on the EAP:  DS/SPP needs to clarify the 
incorporation of the Section 1500 completed by the Integrated 
Survey Teams and with what the Section 1500 is supposed to 
have. 
 
L.  (U)  RSO and RSO/IS Training:  Program is necessary, 
generally effective, can be updated to better mitigate 
vulnerabilities.  Both of the ARSO\'s serving in Kinshasa 
arrived well-trained and ready to handle the challenges a 
post like Kinshasa offers.  That said, there is not much 
opportunity for a RSO who has been in the field for 2-3 posts 
to receive any RSO/IS training.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, CG, UG, US, (GHONDA,, ANTOINE)(BEMBA JEAN-PIERRE) 
SUBJECT: EMBASSY ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THAT FOREIGN MINISTER 
GHONDA REMAINS IN OFFICE 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In demarches to both President Kabila\'s 
Chef de Cabinet and Vice President Bemba, the Embassy argued 
that FM Ghonda was a key element in the success of the July 
14 and 15 meetings in Washington.  Given the importance of 
his likely contribution to future such negotiations, we 
argued that he be retained in office.  The Chef de Cabinet 
said President Kabila was anxious to do so, but Bemba, who 
controlled the appointment in accordance with the Sun City 
Accords, was determined to replace him.  We later argued our 
points with Vice President Bemba, but he seemed adamant in 
his decision to see Ghonda replaced.  However, the decision 
has not yet been announced, so the question may perhaps still 
be open. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On July 16 the Embassy received a request from AF/DAS 
Yamamoto that we approach senior GDRC officials to urge that 
Foreign Minister Ghonda be retained in office.  This followed 
a number of reports, in the press and in our conversations, 
indicating that FM Ghonda\'s removal was being demanded of 
President Kabila by Vice President Bemba.  This was 
reportedly at the urging of Uganda President Museveni who was 
displeased with Ghonda\'s attitude during the recent meetings 
in Abuja. 
 
3. (C)  Seizing an opportunity during a meeting already 
scheduled with President Kabila\'s Chef de Cabinet, Evariste 
Boshab, Charge\' raised the issue of Ghonda\'s future.  Boshab 
listened to our view that Ghonda had been particularly 
helpful in bringing the meetings at the Department on July 14 
and 15 on increasing peace and stability in the Great Lakes 
region to a successful conclusion (especially favorable to 
the interests of the DRC) and that his continued 
participation in follow-on negotiations was important to 
their success.  Boshab said that Vice President Bemba had 
indeed insisted that President Kabila dismiss Ghonda - as was 
Bemba\'s right given that the Foreign Ministryship is one of 
the positions which the MLC (Movement for Congolese 
Liberation) controls as agreed to in the Sun City Accords. 
 
4. (C)  President Kabila resisted this, and was especially 
unhappy with Bemba\'s proposed replacement, Raymond Ramazani 
Baya, formerly Ambassador to Paris.  Kabila had gone so far 
as to say he would not work with Mr. Baya even if he were 
required to appoint him. 
 
5. (C)  Boshab said he would take our views to the President 
immediately (there was a cabinet meeting in session).  He 
suggested we see Bemba and also Speaker of the House Kamitatu 
who, he thought, could influence Bemba. 
 
6. (C)  We had, in fact, already meant to see Bemba who 
finally got back to the Charge\' at about 8:30 p.m. on the 
16th.  The Charge\' and the Political Counselor drove to 
Bemba\'s residence and were received by him in his living room 
where he had been watching television (and which he continued 
to do sporadically out of the corner of his eye during our 
presentation.) 
 
7. (C)  The Charge\' complimented Bemba on the high quality of 
the ministerial appointments he had offered to the 
Government.  We noted that not least of these was Foreign 
Minister Ghonda who had been a key element in the success of 
the talks in Washington.  The State Department at the highest 
levels had been impressed and hoped that he could continue in 
that office since further delicate negotiations were coming 
up.  The USG was committed to supporting peace and stability 
in the region, something very much in the interests of the 
GDRC, and hoped that, while acknowledging that ministerial 
appointments were entirely a question for the sovereign 
authorities to consider, our views as friends of the DRC 
would be taken into account. 
 
8. (C)  Bemba was distincly not impressed.  Without ever 
mentioning Museveni as a factor in his decision, he said that 
he had already asked President Kabila to discharge Ghonda. 
The Minister was incompetent and treated his reposnsibilities 
with culpable lack of serious attention.  Dossiers were not 
prepared, the MFA was not properly administered, Cabinet was 
left without analytical position papers, and Ghonda, like 
some student who neglected his studies and tried to cram at 
the last minute, went off to conferences without having done 
his homework.  Bemba could not let such conduct continue. 
 
9. (C)  We countered that at least we hoped that in 
consideration of our views and the excellent results of the 
State Department meetings any decision could be put off until 
Ghonda returned with his report. 
 
10. (C)  Bemba refused.  He then launched into a speech about 
his six years of political activity meant entirely for the 
good of his country, and the high esteem in which he had been 
held by, among others Ambassador Richard Holbrook \"who always 
took my telephone calls, even when he was in a meeting.\" 
This was in contrast to the fact that he had never met the 
Secretary of State and that he had yet to receive an official 
 
SIPDIS 
invitation to Washington.  True, he had been told by 
Ambassador Yamamoto that he would always be welcomed, but 
that was not the same thing as a proper invitation with all 
that such implied. 
 
11. (C)  The press reports that Ghonda returned to Kinshasa 
late on 7/19.  Since the  decision to fire him has not been 
announced, there is some chance it will be reversed.  But 
Bemba\'s unyielding attitude does not bode well.  Given the 
delicate relations Bemba has with Olivier Kamitatu, we 
decided not to pursue that path, it being our judgment it 
could well cause more harm than good.

SUBJECT: RUMORS MOUNT OF PENDING GOVERNMENT ATTACK AGAINST 
NKUNDA 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  Eastern regional military commanders were 
ordered to return unexpectedly early to their posts July 21, 
cutting short follow-on meetings scheduled for Kinshasa. 
Upon reaching Bukavu, General Mabe immediately called his 
field commanders in and, according to Monuc sources, briefed 
them on the government\'s battle plan before dispatching them 
to their duty stations.  Similar briefings reportedly took 
place in Kindu and Kisangani, where government troops also 
are concentrated.  Monuc confirms that large numbers of 
civilians are fleeing Minova as rumors circulate that Nkunda 
is rallying his forces for a preemptive attack.  Monuc Bukavu 
believes that government troops could attack Nkunda\'s 
positions in Minova and Kalehe this weekend.  End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
The Word Is Given? 
----------------- 
 
2. (C)  Developments over the last two days suggest that the 
long-postponed attack by government forces against rebel 
general Nkunda\'s positions could be coming soon, possibly 
even this weekend.  Two days of briefings for all the eastern 
regional military commanders (except N. Kivu\'s General Obed, 
who declined to attend) in Kinshasa concluded July 20 with a 
meeting with President Kabila.  The commanders were then 
scheduled to have two days of follow-on meetings in Kinshasa, 
but they were precipitously dispatched to their posts July 
21.  Monuc sources say that S. Kivu regional commander Mbuza 
Mabe immediately called his field commanders to Bukavu for a 
three-hour briefing on the battle plan before dispatching 
them to the field; we believe that commanders in Kindu and 
Kisangani did likewise.  Some troops (no numbers available at 
this time) began moving out of Bukavu toward the north early 
July 22. 
 
------------------------------- 
Rumors Abound As Civilians Flee 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C)  For several days there have been persistent rumors 
that Nkunda is mobilizing his forces (now reportedly 
numbering somewhere between 5,000-10,000) for a preemptive 
strike south, toward Bukavu. As of midday July 22, Monuc has 
seen no evidence of such movement, and Monuc sources in 
contact with forward FADRC elements stationed near Kalehe and 
Minova report that the FADRC is relaxed and reports no 
activity.  Partly in response to fears of an imminent attack 
and partly to escape the apparently increasing depredations 
of Nkunda\'s troops, hundreds of civilians are confirmed by 
Monuc to be fleeing Minova, many across the lake in small 
fishing boats to Idjwe Island where they have family.  At the 
same time, Monuc is in contact with several officers 
nominally under either Nkunda\'s or Obed\'s command, who say 
they will not obey orders from either general, but rather 
intend to take no action unless a genocide begins against 
Rwandaphones.  Press reports continue that government troops 
are moving down from their stations in Beni (northern N. 
Kivu) and Kindu (in Maniema province), but we have no 
confirmation of such movement. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
4. (C)  Trying to make sense out of the chaotic East is, as 
usual, dicing with circumstance. However, the unexpectedly 
rapid return of the commanders to the east and their briefing 
of the field elements does suggest that a decision to take 
the fight to the enemy may finally have been made.  We do not 
believe, however, that Nkunda is preparing to launch any 
southern movement.  Doing so would mean confronting directly 
the bulk of the government forces which lie between Nkunda\'s 
sites and Bukavu, and would seem to yield very little return 
for the cost, particularly since we find it hard to believe 
that he could have 10,000 troops at his disposal. Such a 
number would require virtually all the forces in the 8th 
military region (Obed\'s troops) and a significant number of 
Serufuli\'s militia as well.  Monuc photographs of Kalehe show 
that Nkunda\'s people have gone to considerable trouble to 
fortify four different sites in that area, including 
reinforcing (possibly) with some sort of artillery.  He seems 
much more likely, if pressed, to move laterally from Minova 
to Kalehe and try to hold the ground there -- or, more 
threateningly, to fall back toward Goma, a move which would, 
in every sense of the word, take the fight to N. Kivu 
Governor Serufuli who so far has maintained at least a 
pretense (albeit dubious) of neutrality.  We believe that if 
and when an attack begins, if the government forces have any 
sort of success at all in Minova (which is far from certain), 
Nkunda is most likely to break for Goma in an attempt to 
force Obed or Serufuli to assist him, or at least facilitate 
his escape in the general melee.

SUBJECT: GDRC SLOWLY PREPARING FOR GREAT LAKES CONFERENCE 
 
REF: KINSHASA 414 
 
Classified By: Poloff Gons Nachman for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary. The DRC\'s National Preparatory Committee for 
the Great Lakes Region Conference (on security, economic 
integration and social issues) met for the first time on July 
5th to develop a national agenda. Baudoin Hamuli, National 
Coordinator, acknowledged that GDRC preparations are behind 
schedule and that the President\'s Office remains divided 
about the Congo\'s participation due to suspicions over 
Rwanda\'s intentions. End Summary. 
 
DRC National Committee Behind Schedule on Preparations 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2. (U) The first summit of the  International Conference for 
the Great Lakes Region (IC/GLR) is scheduled to take place in 
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in November 2004. This regional 
meeting is being coordinated by the Special Representative of 
the United Nations Secretary General (SRSG) for the Great 
Lakes region, Ibrahima Fall, and it is expected to address 
security, regional economic integration, and various social 
issues of relevance to the region (reftel). 
 
3. (U) Poloff met with Baudouin Hamuli, DRC National 
Coordinator for the IC/GLR July 15. Hamuli said that DRC 
national commission for this conference had finally been 
created and included 97 members representing various 
ministries, the office of the presidency, and all four 
vice-presidents. This committee met for the first time the 
week of July 5th. 
 
4. (SBU) Hamuli acknowledged that the DRC\'s preparations for 
the conference were behind schedule, but indicated that 
commission members would strive to do their best to prepare 
the DRC\'s agenda. Their goal is to have the first draft of 
the national agenda in two months and the final draft in 
three. Only a core group of 10 committee members is expected 
to travel to the November summit. 
 
GDRC Remains Ambivalent About Great Lakes Conference 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5. (SBU) Hamuli said that his office was working well with 
the Ministry of Regional Cooperation and the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs in preparing for the conference. Various 
other ministries like Social Affairs and Human Rights are 
also actively supporting DRC participation in this event. 
 
6. (C) According to Hamuli, Presidential Advisor Andre 
Kapanga is now also supportive of DRC participation in the 
IC/GLR. However, he noted that Presidential Advisor for 
Security, Samba Kaputo, remained skeptical of this regional 
conference due to suspicion that Rwanda would try to 
manipulate events to the DRC\'s detriment. In Hamuli\'s view, 
this division within the President\'s office accounts for the 
ambivalent GDRC attitude towards the conference and it also 
calls into question the President\'s attendance at the 
November summit. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) GDRC preparations for the IC/GLR are proceeding slowly 
and inefficiently. The newly formed national preparatory 
commission consisting of 97 participants will be hard to 
coordinate and will make it difficult for the GDRC to 
formulate a realistic and focused agenda. Moreover, the 
continued ambivalence within the Presidency to DRC 
participation in the conference hampers preparation efforts 
and calls into question the DRC\'s participation.

SUBJECT: KABILA REPLACES FOREIGN MINISTER 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: President Kabila fired foreign minister 
Antoine Ghonda on July 22, at the insistence of GDRC vice 
president Jean-Pierre Bemba.  This did not come as a 
surprise, since Bemba told us seven days ago he was 
determined to replace Ghonda and his aides had hinted for 
weeks that Bemba had doubts about Ghonda\'s political loyalty. 
 The new foreign minister is Raymond Ramazani Baya, a former 
journalist, minister and ambassador to France, who is 
well-qualified for the job.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Bemba Drops the Hammer 
---------------------- 
2. (C) GDRC President Joseph Kabila officially fired foreign 
minister Antoine Ghonda on July 22.  GDRC vice-president 
Jean-Pierre Bemba, head of the Congo Liberation Movement, had 
demanded Ghonda\'s ouster.  Publicly and privately, Bemba 
accused Ghonda of incompetence.  MLC cadres and MFA 
officials, however, had previously acknowledged in private to 
emboffs that Bemba felt Ghonda had become more loyal to 
Kabila than to Bemba, and that the MLC chief wanted to 
replace him.  According to an MLC communique on July 23, 
Ghonda will remain head of the party\'s Kinshasa federation. 
 
The New Minister 
---------------- 
3. (U unless otherwise marked) The new minister, Raymond 
Ramazani Baya, had until his appointment served as Bemba\'s 
chief diplomatic adviser.  Biodata follow: 
 
--full name: Raymond RAMAZANI BAYA 
 
--born June 17, 1943 in Beni, North Kivu province 
 
--speaks fluent English and French 
 
--comes from a Muslim family, ((C) but Ramazani himself 
recently told emboff he does not practice religion, has been 
a \"bad Muslim\" most of his life) 
 
--studied politics, diplomacy and journalism at Universite 
Libre de Bruxelles (undergraduate degree in 1973);  earned a 
master\'s in public administration/financial management from 
Universite d\'Anvers (1974) 
 
--early career:  radio and television journalist, beginning 
in 1965;  joined the state-run \"Agence Zaire-Presse\" in 1974, 
promoted to economics editor in 1977, headed AZP\'s Brussels 
office 1980-82, and became director of AZP in 1982 
 
--govt. career:  served as minister of information and 
propaganda, 1985-1986;  later appointed ambassador to France 
(year unknown);  allegedly killed two French children in a 
speeding accident in late 1996 (Note:  He is rumored to have 
taken the fall for one of Mobutu\'s family members.  End 
Note.);  following a public outcry in France and an official 
request from the French government, the Zairean government 
waived his diplomatic immunity;  in April 1997 a French court 
handed down a suspended sentence of two years in jail and a 
fine of FRF 50,000 (Note: (C) A French diplomat told poloff 
on July 23 that this background poses no particular problem, 
they will treat Ramazani as they would any other minister. 
End Note.) 
 
--rebel career:  went into exile when Mobutu regime fell; 
has been a member of Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s rebel Congo 
Liberation Movement (MLC) since 1999, serving initially as 
MLC representative in Paris, then as Bemba\'s diplomatic 
adviser 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) Ghonda leaves with a good reputation in post\'s eyes. 
As for \"loyalty,\" it is unclear how effective Ghonda could 
have been had he not gained Kabila\'s trust.  The new foreign 
minister is well-qualified for the job, but is unlikely to 
have as close a relationship with Kabila and his advisers.

1. (C) Summary: Poloff, DATT and British DATT visited 
Kisangani and Goma July 19-22 to meet with N. Kivu governor 
Serufuli, N. Kivu Regional Military Commander Obedi, and 
MONUC elements. Obedi no longer appears loyal to the 
transition government, and Serufuli\'s loyalties are opaque. 
MONUC Goma miloff morale was poor. In recent weeks, MONUC 
Kinshasa has done a poor job separating the important rumors 
from the junk. End Summary. 
 
Kisangani 
--------- 
 
2. (C) On July 19, MONUC miloffs briefed on the current 
situation, operations, and challenges in Orientale (septels 
DAO). Ex-ANC (military wing of the RCD/G) Deputy Military 
Commander said that he had worked with Nkunda in the past and 
that Nkunda was professional and competent, but not a 
charismatic leader and was supported by someone else. He 
added that Nkunda was loyal to principles and if he had made 
an agreement with someone, he would \'go to the end.\' Local 
human rights group Groupe Lotus told poloff that human rights 
in Kisangani had improved, but civilians outside the city 
were still subject to abuses by soldiers. For example, ex-ANC 
soldiers man numerous checkpoints along the Congo River, 
collecting taxes from travelers, and stealing merchandise and 
personal belongings from those who cannot pay. Groupe Lotus 
estimates that a traveler from Kisangani to Ubundu (about 60 
miles) pays 2000FC ($5) and goes through 10 checkpoints. 
 
Brigadier General Obedi 
----------------------- 
 
3. (C) N. Kivu Regional Military Commander Obedi 
disingenuously presented himself as an apolitical team player 
who could be counted on to respond to his Kinshasa-based 
military hierarchy. He said he was firmly with the transition 
government, would execute orders from his military 
hierarchy-- including to arrest Nkunda if he entered Goma-- 
and would attack any elements who attempted to enter his 
province. He qualified these statements by saying he could 
not guarantee his troops would follow him, does not receive 
regular military instructions from Kinshasa, the Nkunda 
affair is really about military integration, and there are 
serious reports that 107 Rwandaphones have been killed by 
troops loyal to FARDC S. Kivu Commander Mabe outside Kalehe. 
(Comment: His actions do not support his claims. He failed to 
attend a mid-July Kinshasa meeting of eastern military 
commanders, his brother-in-law Nkunda continues to move 
freely in N. Kivu, and Nkunda used large numbers of ex-ANC 
(RCD/G military wing) N. Kivu troops during his June 
occupation of Bukavu (Ref A). Obedi\'s claim that his older 
brother\'s death prevented his attendance at the mid-July 
Kinshasa meeting is dubious at best. End comment). MONUC and 
DATT report that the FARDC is likely to declare Obedi a rebel 
commander in the next few days. 
 
Governor Serufuli 
----------------- 
 
4. (C) N. Kivu Governor Serufuli also appears to be trying to 
keep his options open. On the one hand, he raised RCD/G 
standard complaints that the transition government\'s failure 
to adequately address the legitimate concerns of ex-ANC 
officers has contributed to the current crisis, raised 
questions about alleged massacres of Rwandaphones by FARDC 
troops and suggested poloff meet with dissident RCD/G 
parliamentarians. He said he has not negotiated between 
Kabila and Nkunda because it is a military problem and he is 
busy working on political issues. On the other hand, he has 
agreed to work with MONUC to repatriate Rwandan Hutu (FDLR) 
elements, and said that Nkunda has two choices-- arrest or 
exile. Serufuli said he favors exile, although he thinks it 
is unlikely that Nkunda will be able to find a country of 
refuge. 
 
Poor MONUC Goma Morale 
---------------------- 
 
5. (C) On July 21, MONUC miloffs briefed on the current 
situation, operations, and challenges (septels DAO) in N. 
Kivu. MONUC Goma miloff and poloff morale was poor. Miloffs 
were pessimistic about the future of the transition, 
elections, and MONUC\'s revised mandate. MONUC poloff and 
miloffs complained about Kinshasa/field relations and said 
that oftentimes MONUC-Kinshasa believes \'unfounded rumors\' 
rather than its staff in the field. On June 21, the Indian 
Aviation Contingent flew 4 sorties at a cost of $50,000 to 
chase down unfounded rumors of 10,000 troops marching on 
Bukavu-- despite US, UK and MONUC field offices reports that 
there were no significant troop movements along the 
Goma-Bukavu road, and indeed the Indian Aviation Contingent 
reported no unusual activity along the road. On June 22, Emb 
team conducted a low-level flight over the area of Kalehe and 
saw no unusual activity, concentrations of people, vehicles, 
boats, or evidence of burned-out buildings. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) By accident or design, Obedi apparently has become yet 
another ex-ANC dissident commander. As a result, any FARDC 
eastern DRC offensive will probably target Nkunda in northern 
S. Kivu and Obedi in Goma. Serufuli, however, remains a 
wildcard who is motivated by self-interest and the desire to 
maintain his regional power base. He is a shrewd, calculating 
actor who is unlikely to commit firmly to either camp until 
he knows who will win. Although MONUC field offices 
consistently report that Kinshasa does not understand 
dynamics on the ground and changes their messages before 
sending them to New York, assertions that HQ does not trust 
field reporting is a further troubling development. In recent 
weeks, MONUC-Kinshasa has done a poor job of separating the 
important rumors to be verified from the junk. Chasing 10,000 
ghost soldiers from Bukavu to Goma was a waste of $50,000 and 
valuable flight hours. Timely verification of whether FARDC 
S. Kivu Commander Mabe\'s troops have killed up to 100 
Rwandaphone civilians outside Kalehe would have been a better 
use of MONUC\'s resources.

2004 
 
1. Summary.  Bank of Commerce and Development (BCD) 
liquidation and conflict in eastern DRC temporarily 
raise exchange rates.  Prices remain relatively stable. 
The diamond sector continues to see increased activity 
with CEEC projecting exports of USD 1 billion by 2006 
(up from current USD 700-800 million).  Public 
enterprise workers (ONTRA, RVF, RVM, OFIDA, and OCPT) 
strike for salary arrears.  Air traffic controllers may 
be threatening similar action.  The Kindu-Lubumbashi 
rail line reopens with assistance from USAID. 
Utexafrica merges with Hong Kong-based Cha Textiles. 
The IMF approves USD 40 million for the DRC and 
commends GDRC progress towards structural reform.  DRC 
domestic debt reaches USD 1.15 billion. 
Gastroenteritis infection rates rise in Kinshasa due to 
low Congo River water levels.  End Summary. 
 
MONETARY AND PRICE UPDATE 
 
2. Prices have remained relatively stable.  Despite 
problems with river commerce due to low water levels of 
the Congo River during the dry season, most roads are 
passable during this time of year.  Prices also 
remained mostly stable in the DRC\'s eastern provinces 
despite continuing tensions. 
 
3. Exchange rates rose slightly in June and early July 
due to two major events.  First, the Congolese Central 
Bank\'s (BCC) liquidation of the BCD increased the 
demand for USD as bank depositors receiving their 
payments in local currency rushed to convert it to USD. 
Roughly USD 2.5 million was disbursed as part of the 
liquidation during this period.  This situation 
primarily affected the parallel market in Kinshasa, 
where 90 percent of BCD clients reside.  Second, Goma 
and Bukava saw rising exchange rates due to continuing 
regional tension.  Some analysts have suggested that 
rates increased because General Nkunda\'s forces flooded 
Goma and Bukavu exchange markets with local currency 
looted from the BCC\'s Bukavu branch office.  These 
reports are unconfirmed. 
 
MINING 
 
INCREASE IN DIAMOND EXPORTS FORECASTED 
 
4. According to CEEC director Victor Kasongo, the GDRC 
diamond supervisory agency expects DRC rough diamond 
exports to increase to USD 1 billion by 2006. 
Additionally, Kasongo projected production of USD 1 
billion and exports of USD 700-800 million for 2004. 
Kasongo noted that the present difference between 
production and export figures represents the value of 
diamonds being smuggled out of the country. 
 
SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESSMAN FREEZES DRC ASSETS IN BELGIUM 
 
5. The South African press reported that Frans Rootman, 
a businessman formerly operating in the DRC, has frozen 
over USD 20 million in gold and diamonds deposited in 
Belgian banks by the GDRC.  Rootman won a judgment 
against the GDRC in the Transvaal High Court for breach 
of a 1998 contract with former President Laurent Kabila 
whereby Rootman was to receive a commission on the 
recovery of cobalt ore allegedly stolen from Gecamines 
by Zimbabwean Billy Rautenbach, then CEO of Gecamines. 
Rootman filed the suit in civil court naming himself 
plaintiff as a private citizen.  Orders to freeze the 
assets were secured by a Brussels law firm acting on 
Rootman\'s behalf after investigators traced the assets 
to GDRC accounts in the Belgian banks.  Under Belgian 
law the GDRC has 15 days to oppose the order, after 
which Rootman may formally seize the assets.  These 
recent events come in addition to Rootman\'s seizure 
earlier this year of DRC assets in South Africa 
including Gecamines\' corporate jet (since sold at 
auction for USD 1.9 million) and two large tracts of 
land in the Western Cape.  (Comment.  The South African 
Embassy commented that the freeze order was likely 
carried out by the Belgian banks in good faith after 
being contacted by Rootman\'s legal representation in 
Brussels.  SA Embassy was unaware of any specific 
bilateral agreements that would have formerly extended 
the Transvaal High Court\'s ruling.  As a final note, 
press reports on the matter of Rootman\'s freezing and 
seizure of GDRC assets have tended towards the 
outlandish.  Some of the reports are contradicted by 
widely known information, e.g. earlier reports that the 
GDRC\'s 80 percent share in MIBA had been seized are 
simply untrue.  End Comment.) 
 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
 
TELECEL BUSINESS LEAKS ACROSS BORDER 
 
6. DRC-based Starcell (formerly Telecel) is penetrating 
the cellular market in northern Angola.  Starcell 
phones and prepaid subscription cards are being 
smuggled across the border by Angolan nationals and 
sold at cheaper prices than phones offered locally (USD 
100 versus USD 240).  Proximity to the DRC border 
permits Angolan users access to Telecel\'s network. 
(Comment.  Starcell may have little other option than 
to actively promote this trade.  The company has been 
losing market share since the arrival in the DRC of 
Celtel and Vodacom.  End Comment.) 
 
LABOR AFFAIRS 
 
PUBLIC ENTERPRISE WORKERS STRIKE FOR SALARY ARREARS 
 
7. Workers at DRC public enterprises and government 
services including ONATRA (transportation) RVF (river 
commerce), RVM (maritime trade), OFIDA (customs), and 
OCPT (postal and telecommunications) staged brief 
strikes in Kinshasa and the port cities of Banana and 
Boma to protest unpaid wages and poor working 
conditions.  The strikes occurred in late June and 
early July, but work quickly resumed after the GDRC 
agreed to distribute a portion of the unpaid wages 
totaling several million FC.  (Note.  Many DRC public 
enterprises are in arrears.  RVF workers, for example, 
had not been paid for nine months prior to the strike, 
but returned to work after being promised one month\'s 
back pay.  End Note.) 
 
POSSIBLE RVA STRIKE 
 
8. Local press reports that workers of La Regie des 
Voies Aeriennes (RVA) are preparing to strike. 
Unconfirmed reports indicate that workers had 
tentatively set 26 July as the final date for 
negotiation before the strike begins.  RVA\'s air 
traffic controllers and technicians claim that the GDRC 
has reneged on an agreement negotiated to end a strike 
last April.  (Comment.  Econoffs interviewed local 
sources including air traffic controllers who indicate 
that strike rumors may be to due to internal RVA 
management wrangling.  Salary arrears are a common 
cause of labor unrest in the DRC, but RVA is generally 
timelier in its salary payments than other government 
services.  End Comment.) 
 
TRANSPORTATION 
 
KINDU-LUBUMBASHI RAIL LINE REOPENS 
 
9. Rail transportation between Kindu and Lubumbashi in 
Katanga province has resumed.  No trains had traveled 
the route since 1998.  The line will be used primarily 
to transport freight and food aid.  USAID provided most 
of the USD 1.3 million in repair costs.  (Comment.  The 
reopening of the Kindu-Lubumbashi line is important in 
that it 1) reconnects regions of the DRC isolated by 
conflicts of recent years, thus promoting 
reunification, and 2) permits the flow of aid and 
commercial traffic which will help to reinvigorate the 
economy in Maniema.  End Comment.) 
 
JORDAN, DRC SIGN AIR TRANSPORT AGREEMENT 
 
10. Jordan\'s Petra News Agency reported that DRC 
Transport Minister Joseph Olenghankoy signed an 
agreement with Jordanian civil aviation authorities to 
allow commercial flights between the two countries. 
(NFI) 
 
FORESTRY 
 
11. Local press reports that La Societe Africaine des 
Bois (Safbois), an American-owned company, has 
purchased USD 2 million in equipment and vehicles to 
augment its timber exploration and exploitation 
operations in Isangi, Orientale Province. 
 
TEXTILES 
 
HONG KONG TEXTILE GROUP PURCHASES UTEXAFRICA 
 
12. Local press reported that the Hong Kong-based Cha 
Textiles purchased a majority of the public shares of 
Utexafrica from the company\'s former Franco-Belgian 
owners.  Press reports indicate that Cha intends to 
change the firm\'s name to Congotex and trim its 
workforce.  (Comment.  Econoffs have met with Cha 
Textiles\' representative in Kinshasa.  The case appears 
to be a merger rather than a buy-out.  Cha had a 
presence in Kinshasa until 1993, when its facilities 
were looted.  Utexaftrica\'s operations have also been 
severely reduced since the pillages of 1991 and 1993. 
The company is now in dire financial straits.  Cha\'s 
offer constitutes an opportunity to recapitalize.  End 
Comment.) 
 
REGULATORY ISSUES 
 
PARLIAMENT ADOPTS DRAFT BILL ON MONEY LAUNDERING 
 
13. In early July, the national parliament adopted a 
draft bill on money laundering.  The proposed 
legislation creates a clear definition of money 
laundering and provides for domestic enforcement 
mechanisms and international cooperation.  The draft 
bill also includes a provision defining and outlawing 
the financing of terrorism.  (Comment.  While this 
draft bill is a step towards financial transparency and 
accountability, it remains to be codified into law. 
Even if this occurs, detection and enforcement 
shortcomings are likely.  End Comment.) 
 
HEALTH 
 
GASTROENTERITIS HITS KINSHASA 
 
14. Gastroenteritis infection due to water supply 
contamination by E. Coli bacterium has resulted in 77 
deaths and nearly 3,000 reported infections in 
Kinshasa.  Local authorities and NGOs have established 
treatment centers and are monitoring the spread of 
infection.  (Comment.  Lack of access to clean drinking 
water results in occasional outbreaks of bacterial 
infection in Kinshasa.  The unusually low water level 
of the Congo River during this dry season has 
exacerbated contamination problems.  End Comment.) 
 
AID 
 
IMF APPROVES USD 40 MILLION FOR DRC 
 
15. The IMF has approved a release of USD 40 million to 
the DRC after completing a fourth review of the 
country\'s performance under a USD 861 million Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility Arrangement.  The IMF 
also approved an additional USD 1.7 million requested 
by the DRC under the HIPC initiative. 
 
DEBT 
 
AUDIT REVEALS DEBT INCREASE 
 
16. According to Finance Minister Andre-Phillipe Futa, 
the DRC\'s domestic debt climbed to USD 1.15 billion in 
2003.  Futa noted that the DRC is not likely to clear 
this debt in the near future.  (Comment.  The fact that 
domestic debt received scrutiny via an audit report is 
in itself a positive development.  Nevertheless, the 
GDRC has yet to make any clear provisions for dealing 
with its debt.  End Comment.)

SUBJECT: INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT APPENDIX 2004 
 
REF: STATE 141379 
 
1. Per Reftel, Post submits ICS appendix below. 
 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO: July 2004 Appendix to 2003 
Investment Climate Statement. 
 
This appendix serves as an update to the 2003 Investment 
Climate Statement for the Democratic Republic of Congo. It 
has been provided to assist investors in the interim period 
resulting from the U.S. Government\'s decision to begin 
publishing the Country Commercial Guide (of which the 
Investment Climate Statement is a chapter) on a calendar 
year basis, in January instead of August. 
 
The United States Government has reviewed the 2003 
Investment Climate Statement for the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, and has noted the following changes that have 
occurred since its publication. In most circumstances, if a 
portion of the Investment Climate Statement has not been 
modified in this appendix, it is because the U.S. Government 
is satisfied that it continues to accurately reflect the 
state of affairs in the Democratic Republic of Congo as of 
July 2004. 
 
Openness to Foreign Investment 
------------------------------ 
 
Since 2003, two positive developments have marginally 
improved the investment climate in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo. First, the Port of Matadi has almost completed 
upgrades to comply with International Shipping and Port 
Facility Security guidelines, as mandated by the 
International Maritime Organization. This combined with 
slightly improved functioning of the \"Guichet Unique\" - a 
one-stop electronic customs and fees payment bureau 
developed by the World Bank - allow for greater ease in 
transport of goods to the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
 
Second, after one-year of operations, the Cadastre Minier 
(Cami - Mining Concessions Authority) appears to be 
functioning reasonably well. Although currently not 
accepting new applications, major international mining 
companies have lauded Cami\'s performance to date. Decisions 
appear to have been made fairly and according to the law. 
 
Conversion and Transfer Policies 
-------------------------------- 
 
The Congolese Franc continues to remain stable at 
approximately 390 Francs to the U.S. dollar. Exchange rates 
on the informal market in the former rebel controlled areas 
(Equateur, Kivus and Oriental Provinces) have largely 
converged with those of the former government controlled 
areas (Kinshasa, Katanga, the Kasais and Bas-Congo 
provinces). 
 
The IMF believes the Congolese Central Bank (BCC) has done 
an adequate job managing monetary policy. It was able to 
release larger denomination 200 and 500 Franc notes during 
2003-2004 without experiencing bouts of speculation against 
the Franc. 
 
Expropriation and Compensation 
------------------------------ 
 
In early-2004, one claimant under the U.S.-Zaire Bilateral 
Investment Treaty won a settlement from the International 
Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). 
However, the claimant has not yet been able to collect the 
payment from the Congolese government. 
 
Nevertheless, threats of expropriation or of a 
disadvantageous \"revision\" of a contract or concession are 
always present. 
 
Dispute Settlement 
------------------ 
 
No significant changes since 2003. 
 
Performance Requirements and Incentives 
--------------------------------------- 
 
No significant changes since 2003. 
 
Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
-------------------------------------------- 
No significant changes since 2003. 
 
Transparency of the Regulatory System 
------------------------------------- 
 
Only one significant change in the regulatory environment 
has taken place since 2003. The establishment of the 
aforementioned \"Guichet Unique\" at Matadi (and also at 
Kinshasa) has helped to streamline customs and fees payments 
when importing or exporting goods. The \"Guichet Unique\" is 
not yet fully functioning - some government services are 
still trying to escape incorporation into the system and 
technical/electronic difficulties resulting from poorly 
trained personnel - however, it is a step in the right 
direction. 
 
Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
---------------------------------------- 
 
No significant changes since 2003. 
 
Political Violence 
------------------ 
 
Congo has suffered periodic bouts of widespread looting 
initiated by the military, including in 1991, 1993, and 1996- 
1997. There was also limited widescale looting initiated by 
civilians in 2004. Due to civilian frustration as well as 
poor military pay and discipline, the possibility of future 
widespread looting cannot be ruled out. 
 
In June 2003, a transitional government was established to 
prepare the country for multi-party elections in 2005 or 
2006. The central government exercises limited control in 
eastern Congo, and armed skirmishes continue in parts of 
Katanga, Orientale, and North and South Kivu provinces. 
 
Corruption 
---------- 
 
No significant changes since 2003. 
 
Bilateral Investment Treaties 
----------------------------- 
 
No significant changes since 2003. 
 
OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
OPIC is currently accepting applications for political risk 
insurance for companies operating in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo. It is presently reviewing several applications 
submitted in the first half of CY 2004.

undetermined.

SUBJECT: POSITIONING FOR THE NEXT TRIPARTITE TALKS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Roger Meece.  Reason 1.5 b/d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: In an informal Sunday meeting at the CMR, 
former FM Ghonda told the Ambassador that the GDRC wants to 
have some agreement regarding the proposed Joint Verification 
Mechanism (JVM) prior to the next round of Tripartite talks. 
He asserted that the Rwandans had concurred formally with 
this idea in Washington, but in fact are seeking to drag out 
Joint Verification talks.  In  response to a question, Ghonda 
said that he is proposing that the GDRC be represented in the 
next round by new FM Ramazani and Regional Cooperation 
Minister Nyamwisi.  The latter would be the de facto Kabila 
rep, as thus far at least, Kabila will not deal with 
Ramazani.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) Former FM Antoine Ghonda stopped by the CMR on Sunday, 
August 1 for a lengthy but informal discussion of the current 
situation in the DRC.  Septel will cover his account of 
developments leading to his recent replacement as FM by Vice 
President Jean Pierre Bemba, and some observations about the 
domestic Congolese scene. 
 
3. (C) During the conversation, the Ambassador asked Ghonda 
about Kinshasa\'s view of the next round of Tripartite talks 
in light of the Ministerial change.  Ghonda responded by 
first noting that the GDRC (comment: presumably meaning 
Ghonda, and by implication Kabila) wants to have some kind of 
agreement regarding the proposed Joint Verification Mechanism 
prior to the next round of talks.  Ghonda said that both the 
Ugandans and Rwandans had concurred with this proposal during 
the last round of talks in Washington.  But, he added, in 
fact the Rwandans are not eager to move the Joint 
Verification Mechanism forward and are in fact stalling, 
dragging the process out as much as possible.  He observed 
that the Rwandans would therefore be all too pleased to 
attend the next Tripartite round without any forward movement 
on joint verification, all the more reason from Kinshasa\'s 
perspective to stick to the Washington agreement.  Ghonda 
expressed hope that a scheduled meeting this week in Nairobi 
would produce some progress on the Joint Verification front 
which could lead to more general progress.  (Note: 
PolCounselor was separately informed by MONUC Chief of Staff 
July 30 that the Nairobi talks have been postponed at the 
request of the GOR.  End note). 
 
4. (C) The Ambassador also asked about new FM Ramazani\'s 
position and the more general question of future Congolese 
representation in the talks.  Ghonda (please protect) said 
that to-date, President Kabila would have nothing to do with 
Ramazani.  While Ghonda said that he has been trying to get 
Kabila to modify this stance, thus far he has been 
unsuccessful.  Ghonda has proposed that the GDRC be 
represented in the next round by FM Ramazani in some sort of 
co-representative arrangement with International Cooperation 
Minister Mbusa Nyamwisi.  The latter would serve as the de 
facto Kabila representative in the talks.  Ghonda indicated 
that no final decision has yet been made, but that he 
(Ghonda) at this point has no official role. 
 
5. (C) Comment: It was clear from his general comments that 
Ghonda is essentially finished as a part of Jean-Pierre 
Bemba\'s MLC, but that he continues to do discrete work for 
President Kabila.  Nonetheless, he implied that any future 
formal role for himself will probably not be decided until at 
least the end of the month, after some of the dust settles. 
In the meantime, it appears that Ghonda and Kabila want to 
push forward with the Joint Verification Mechanism, and are 
willing to try to use the tripartite talks as some leverage 
on the issue.  The problem of a Foreign Affairs Minister who 
does not enjoy the confidence of the President is an 
additional complication and needs some further processing in 
Kinshasa as well to find an acceptable formula.  The 
Ambassador is scheduled to present credentials to President 
Kabila on August 3.  While that occasion is likely to be 
ceremonial with little chance for substantive exchange, it 
will open the door to increased contacts in Kinshasa to help 
push for continued forward movement on this and other 
questions.  End comment.

SUBJECT: UNHCR REPATRIATES 283 AS PART OF ONGOING 
REPATRIATION EFFORT 
 
Classified By: Poloff Meghan Moore for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (U) Summary: UNHCR repatriated July 26-27 a total of what 
UNHCR believed to be 283 Rwandan refugees from S. Kivu to 
Rwanda as part of an ongoing repatriation effort. Once they 
crossed the border, however, many \"refugees\" said they were 
really Congolese who wished to stay in the Congo. While these 
individuals might indeed be savvy Congolese using the 
international assistance network to their advantage, they 
also could be pawns in a game designed to embarrass both the 
Congolese government and the UN. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On July 27, UNHCR Acting Country Representative told 
poloff that July 26-27, UNHCR repatriated a total of what it 
believed to be 283 Rwandan refugees (50 men, 63 women and 170 
children) from S. Kivu to Rwanda as part of an ongoing 
repatriation effort. (Note: From Jan 1-May 30, UNHCR 
repatriated 2544 Rwandans from South Kivu to Rwanda. Due to 
insecurity in Bukavu during June, only 19 were repatriated. 
End note.) 
 
3. (C) The UNHCR rep. said the refugees contacted a local NGO 
in Bunyakiri on July 23 and told the staff they were Rwandan 
refugees who wished to return to Rwanda. On July 24-25, they 
were transported from Bunyakiri to Bukavu for standard UNHCR 
refugee screening and processing. On July 25, the group told 
UNHCR Bukavu Protection Officer that everyone in the group 
was born in the DRC, children of Rwandan immigrants from the 
1930s-1950s. They identified themselves as Rwandan nationals, 
and said they wished to return to Rwanda. On July 26, UNHCR 
Bukavu Protection Officer interviewed the men and women 
separately. The men said that the main reason they left their 
homes outside Bunyakiri was due to clashes on or about July 
16 between the 10th Military Region and Nkunda\'s troops. They 
said that 10th Military Region troops forced them to leave 
the area and they were forced to go to the UNHCR repatriation 
center at Bunayakiri. The men reported two cases of female 
rape, but the women reported no rapes. Neither group said 
that they had been mistreated by Mabe\'s soldiers, held in a 
detention facility, or tortured. At the Bukavu transit 
center, each family was interviewed separately and completed 
voluntary repatriation forms. Once they crossed the border, 
however, the Acting Country Rep said they changed their 
story, said they had lied to UNHCR about being Rwandan, were 
really Congolese, and wished to stay in the Congo. In 
response, the S. Kivu governor initially agreed to let them 
to return to the DRC. He then said that they should stay in 
Rwanda while their true status was determined. On July 30, 
the Rwandan government granted asylum to this group and moved 
them to a refugee camp. 
 
4. (C) On July 27, Acting UNHCR Country Representative told 
poloff  he was surprised and disappointed by the extensive 
negative attention this case had received. In his opinion, 
UNHCR staff responded according to their standard procedures, 
did what they thought was appropriate, and were blindsided 
when the group crossed the border and declared they were 
expelled Congolese citizens. On July 30, two MONUC civilian 
officers separately told poloff that the whole story was 
really \'fishy.\' MONUC poloff said that this may be related to 
the larger issue of attempting to portray the current Kivus 
conflict as an ethnic one. She said hardline Banyamulenge 
leader Benoit Kadage and the GOR have been working together 
to prevent moderate Banyamulenge refugees from meeting with 
GDRC officials. For example, on July 30, the Minister of 
Social Affairs and S. Kivu Vice Governor (himself a 
Banyamulenge) met with Banyamulenge refugees in Burundi while 
waiting to receive clearance from the GOR to meet with 
Banyamulenge refugees in Cyangugu. As of August 3, MONUC 
Bukavu reported that clearance had not been given, and the 
Minister had not been able to meet with the refugees. In 
addition, 12 moderate Banyamulenge leaders who were invited 
by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)  to 
participate in a reconciliation ceremony in Bukavu  were 
unable to participate because they had been intimidated and 
kept in Cyangugu by Kadage. (Comment: This is not the first 
time that Kadage has been accused of preventing refugees from 
returning or meeting with Congolese officials. He has also 
been accused of helping Nkunda recruit soldiers, including 
child soldiers, from refugee camps in Rwanda. End comment.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) Clearly, UNHCR had no intention of forcibly expelling 
Congolese citizens.  There also are suspicious elements to 
this story, such as why this particular group assembled in 
Bunyakiri (where other IDPs were not), told at least two 
organizations they were Rwandan, and only changed their story 
when they crossed the border. Maybe they were scared and did 
what they could to move from what they perceived as a 
dangerous location, or maybe they are pawns in a game 
designed to embarrass both the Congolese government and the 
UN. This case clearly illustrates some of the complexities 
surrounding the nationalities issue in the Congo, including 
how individuals within groups identify themselves (i.e., 
Rwandan vice Congolese), and how outsiders, such as UNHCR and 
local Congolese authorities, define groups.

1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified. Not for internet 
distribution. 
 
2. (U) Summary. Despite the failure of negotiations between 
the GDRC and various unions earlier this year, most civil 
servants have returned to work.  Isolated strikes have since 
occured in several public enterprises and services, but 
general striking has not resumed.  Civil servants remain 
frustrated, but are disorganized and have few alternatives 
but to continue working for meager salaries that often go 
unpaid.  Inter-union tensions are running high, with various 
groups attempting instigate another general strike.  The GDRC 
is attempting to co-opt individual unions in order to prevent 
this.  End Summary. 
 
3. (U) In late June and early July, Kinshasa saw renewed 
striking by several public enterprises and services including 
ONATRA (transportation), RVF (river commerce), RVM (maritime 
trade), OFIDA (customs), and OCPT (postal and 
telecommunications).  (Note.  A civil service general strike 
in February 2004 was suspended pending further negotiations 
with the GDRC.  However, the GDRC refuses to budge past FC 
10,000 total salary/month for the lowest paid worker.  See 
refs A and B.  End Note.)  These strikes were intended to 
protest both salary arrears and the continuing lack of 
resolution to the GDRC-civil service salary debate.  Again, 
civil servants quickly returned to work, this time after the 
GDRC agreed to distribute a portion of their unpaid wages 
(ref C).  (Note.  To date, few of these promised 
disbursements have been made.  End Note.) 
 
4. (SBU) In late July, local press reported that air traffic 
controllers (ATCs) of Regie des Voies Aerienne (RVA) and 
Aviation Civile were preparing to strike.  Econoffs 
interviewed ATCs and RVA management and determined that 
strike rumors were unfounded and could be attributed either 
to attempts by various unions to instigate another general 
strike or internal political wrangling amongst RVA leadership 
(ref C). 
 
5. (SBU) RVA and Aviation Civile are critical government 
enterprises controlling overflight and landing rights and 
fees.  They not only provide revenue to the GDRC, but control 
the primary means for moving people and commercial goods 
within the country.  Recognizing these facts, the GDRC moved 
swiftly to end a strike by ATCs at the N\'Djili airport in 
late February (ref B).  (Comment.  In attempting to instigate 
a second ATC strike, union heads were likely seeking to 
capitalize on RVA and Aviation Civile\'s influence in the GDRC 
to gain concessions for all civil servants.  However, as the 
GDRC pays RVA and Aviation Civile employees decent salaries 
on a relatively timely basis, ATCs had little incentive to 
risk their jobs by striking.  End Comment.) 
 
6. (SBU) Between 27 July and 3 August, Econoffs met with 
representatives of various unions and and public enterprises 
including SLC (Syndicat Libre du Congo), CONAMAFET 
(Confederation Nationale des Mandataires et Agents de 
l\'Etat), FOSYFET (Force Syndicale des Agents et 
Fonctionnaires de l\'Etat), SYNAFET (Syndicat National des 
Agents et Fonctionnaires de l\'Etat et Para-Etatiques), and 
RVF.  Most of the representatives offered little substantive 
information regarding their intentions or organizational 
capacities, but preferred instead to discuss their sentiments 
towards the GDRC.  These ranged from mildly distrustful to 
incensed, with Mr. Emery Tshipamba of SYNAFET calling the 
GDRC\'s most recent salary offer \"a crime akin to social 
genocide.\" 
 
7. (SBU) Mr. Mutumoyi of SLC and Mr. Mayala of CONAMAFET 
mentioned repeatedly that the February general strike had not 
ended, but was merely \"suspended\" and could be resumed at any 
time.  Similar veiled threats of further striking were a 
common theme, but no specific dates or groups were mentioned. 
 
 
8. (SBU) Comment.  Labor unrest will likely continue, but not 
on the scale seen in February 2004.  Numerous civil service 
unions compete against one another for membership and 
government attention.  This serves to dilute their influence 
in labor negotiations with the GDRC.  Attempts to organize 
another general strike have been easily stymied by the GDRC, 
which selectively disburses salary arrears (as in the case of 
the July strikes) or negotiates unilaterally with one or 
another union (as with the ATCs) to divide and conquer the 
civil service labor front.  End Comment.

1. (C) Summary: During the International Criminal Court\'s 
(ICC) first official visit to the DRC, Deputy Prosecutor 
Serge Brammertz met with interested parties to open lines of 
communication, work on technical judicial issues, and learn 
more about the situation on the ground. Post welcomed 
Brammertz\'s open admission that his team is still getting up 
to speed, will work in a difficult political and logistical 
environment, and will have a profound impact on politics in 
the DRC. Most importantly, he seems to understand that 
initial ICC investigations need to be conducted in a manner 
that will not derail the transition.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The International Criminal Court (ICC) made its first 
official visit to the DRC from July 26-July 30. The 
delegation, led by Deputy Prosecutor Serge Brammertz, met 
with Kinshasa-based Congolese officials, MONUC and other UN 
agencies, local and international human rights groups, civil 
society, and diplomatic missions. During a July 30 courtesy 
call on the Charge, Brammertz said their mission was focused 
on meeting the relevant actors, coordinating technical legal 
issues with Congolese justice officials, and learning more 
about the situation on the ground. They were happy that their 
visit was warmly received by the Congolese people, but were 
surprised by the Congolese media\'s extreme interest and poor 
journalism.  Brammertz confirmed that initial investigations 
would focus on the Ituri region, but said that the 
President\'s request was more general, and the ICC will look 
into other areas as necessary. 
 
3. (C) The delegation stressed that they understood the DRC 
is a difficult and complex environment in which to work, both 
for logistical and political reasons. Brammertz said the ICC 
plans to conduct its work within the wider context of the 
peace process and will need to strike the right balance of 
ending criminal impunity while not jeopardizing the 
transition. In particular, he hopes that ICC\'s initial 
investigations, which will focus on abuses committed by 
actors outside the transition, such as the Ituri armed 
groups, will help bring the transitional government closer 
together. (Note: The ICC may only prosecute crimes committed 
since July 1, 2002 when the Rome Statute establishing the 
court entered into force. End note.). 
 
4. (C) Operationally, the ICC is in the process of getting 
its DRC operations up and running and hammering out technical 
judicial issues, most notably how the ICC and the Congolese 
courts will work together (complementarity). The ICC plans to 
establish their local office as early as September, when they 
will start initial investigations. Going forward, Brammertz 
said their main challenges will be managing Congolese 
expectations, and developing objective criteria for 
establishing investigations. 
 
5. (C) On August 3, a MONUC Poloff who works on Ituri 
commented to poloff that the delegation appeared to have 
relatively limited knowledge of Ituri. For example, she said 
they had not seen the widely available documentary, Congo\'s 
Killing Fields, did not know that a number of local and 
international groups have extensive photographic evidence of 
the atrocities, and were surprised by the wide-scale, 
de-centralized nature of the violence. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Post welcomed Brammertz\'s open admission that his team 
of 10-12 is still getting up to speed, will work in a 
difficult political and logistical environment, and will have 
a profound impact on politics in the DRC. Most importantly, 
he seems to understand that initial ICC investigations need 
to be conducted in a manner that will not derail the 
transition.

SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO USITC REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 
 
REF: A. STATE 137500 
 
     B. KINSHASA 1407 
 
1. The following replies to USITC request for information 
relating to its study on U.S.-Sub-Saharan African Trade and 
Investment. 
 
2. Since the inauguration of the Transitional Government in 
July 2003, the DRC has made progress in moving from a war to 
a peace economy in most of the country. Government control is 
being slowly extended to former rebel controlled provinces 
and tax receipts are increasing. Although politically 
difficult, some reforms are taking place. Fiscal and monetary 
discipline are largely maintained. The exchange rate has 
remained stable in both the formal and informal market over 
the past year and inflation has dropped to single digits. 
Many challenges remain: Political reintegration of the Kivus 
and parts of Oriental Province into Kinshasa\'s control as 
well as preparations for elections are priorities for the 
international community. The remainder of paragraph 2 follows 
the same format as paragraph 5 in Ref A. 
 
A. From 2003 to present, there have been no major changes in 
DRC economic, trade or investment policies. In 2002, 
legislation drafted in concert with the World Bank was 
approved by the GDRC and provided new Mining, Forestry, Labor 
and Investment Codes. Implementation of these laws is done on 
a case-by-case basis as businesses bring questions and 
disputes to the government. The sole U.S. policy with 
potential to directly impact the DRC is AGOA III. Although 
the DRC is AGOA eligible for all but the textile provisions, 
local knowledge of AGOA is limited. The majority of exports 
to the U.S. under AGOA consist of petroleum. 
 
B. The DRC is a member of EMAC, COMESA and SADC. There have 
been no major developments affecting the DRC within these 
groupings. 
 
C. Although the World Bank has begun to apply its Private 
Sector Development Plan for the DRC, the restructuring of 
state-owned enterprises is moving very slowly. No 
privatization plans have begun in earnest. Political 
difficulties frustrate progress on privatization. State-owned 
enterprises are considered by many Congolese to be the 
patrimony of the country. Privatization, especially sale to 
foreign corporations, is widely viewed in a negative light. 
Futhermore, state-owned enterprises are historically a source 
of income for government officials. Loss of direct access to 
these resources is not very palatable, and the GDRC continues 
to try to hold onto its parastatals for as long as possible. 
 
D. Post is unaware of any AGOA related investments or 
non-traditional export developments. Government reform 
efforts have included proposing anti-corruption and 
anti-money laundering legislation. Port security and customs 
clearance procedures have been improved over the last few 
months. The process for granting mining concessions has also 
been improved through the installation of the World Bank 
designed Cadastre Minier - Mining Concessions Authority (Ref 
B). On the initiative of the Belgian government, discussions 
have begun on reactivating the Great Lakes Economic 
Community. This is still in a very nascent stage. 
 
E. Economic Counselor accompanied a team from the Corporate 
Council on Africa on an AGOA sensitization tour of the DRC 
during October 2003. Most major cities were covered. The 
presentation was well received by local business communities. 
This tour, and AGOA in general, also grabbed the high-level 
attention in the GDRC, including that of President Kabila and 
of one of his advisors. The new Foreign Minister has also 
expressed interest in AGOA directly to the Ambassador. 
However, a funamental misunderstanding still remains among 
many Congolese who believe that AGOA is a bilateral aid 
program, rather than an investment and export incentive 
program.

SUBJECT: DRC PARTICIPATES IN CENTCOM\'S TAMPA CONFERENCE ON 
DISASTER MANAGEMENT 
 
1. (U) Summary. Two Congolese officials participated in 
Centcom\'s Golden Spear Conference on disaster management held 
in Tampa, Florida, from July 26-30. The GDRC has expressed 
its appreciation for this regional initiative and indicated 
that it looks forward to further cooperation. End Summary. 
 
DRC Joins Centcom\'s Golden Spear Disaster Management Efforts 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
2. (U) DRC\'s Vice-Minister of Interior, Paul Musafiri, and 
Defense Ministry Liaison Officer Richard Bomboko, 
participated in Centcom\'s Golden Spear Conference on disaster 
management in Tampa, Florida, July 26-30. The Golden Spear is 
a Centcom initiative to assist East African countries in 
coordinating regional disaster management efforts. 
Participants included Burundi, DRC, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, 
Rwanda, Tanzania, The Seychelles, and Uganda. 
 
3. (U) The Golden Spear disaster management near-term goal is 
to enhance readiness at the national and regional levels 
through training, bilateral activities, and the development 
of a regional response mechanism. During the conference, it 
became clear that participants were at different stages of 
preparedness for managing man-made and natural disasters. 
Kenya appeared to be the country that had devoted the most 
resources and organization to disaster management, while the 
DRC was only starting to plan a national initiative. 
 
 
DRC Actively Participates in Tampa Conference 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Musafiri actively participated during the conference\'s 
discussions and table top exercises. He also gave an eloquent 
presentation of the Congo\'s current post-conflict situation 
and existing mechanism for disaster management. Musafiri was 
candid about the DRC\'s limited national resources and lack of 
infrastructure to cope with disasters. He also indicated that 
the DRC intends to fully participate in the Golden Spear 
forum and would be ready to present its national disaster 
management plan at the next regional meeting next year. The 
plan should already have been in effect several months by 
that time. 
 
Interior Vice-Minister to Coordinate DRC\'s Plan 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (U) Poloff met with Musafiri on August 5, to discuss his 
impressions of the conference. Musafiri said that he had met 
with Vice-President Azarias Ruberwa to report on his visit to 
Tampa and that Ruberwa was very pleased with the results. 
Musafiri noted that the GDRC was very grateful to the U.S. 
for the assistance provided through Golden Spear and that it 
looked forward to further cooperation. 
 
6. (U) Ruberwa asked Musafiri to prepare a draft plan for the 
creation of an inter-ministerial commission on disaster 
management as well as a national disaster management plan. 
Musafiri will prepare these proposals and then request that 
President Kabila issue the appropriate decree creating the 
commission. He will then propose that the new commission be 
funded under the 2005 national budget. 
 
Comment 
------- 
7. (U) The DRC\'s participation in the Golden Spear Conference 
on disaster management has been a step forward in renewed 
US-Congolese military cooperation efforts. It has also 
allowed the GDRC to access information and support necessary 
to develop its national disaster response infrastructure. 
Musafiri has indicated that as part of these efforts, the 
GDRC will work to create its first fire-rescue department in 
the city of Kinshasa. Post will assist the GDRC with 
information that will facilitate these efforts in cooperation 
with the Hillsborough County Fire Department in Florida.

SUBJECT: ECONOMIC REPORT - JULY 25 THROUGH AUGUST 04 
 
 
1. Summary.  Exchange rates are quite stable, but prices 
show signs of impending increase due to transportation 
problems between Kinshasa and the provinces, including the 
collapse of the Mai-Ndombe bridge.  The GDRC reported 
significant macroeconomic progress for 2003, including 5 
percent GDP growth and single digit inflation.  Diamond 
exports rose sharply in July due to the expulsion of Congo- 
Brazzaville from the Kimberley Process certification scheme. 
New pumps provided by the ICRC increased Regideso\'s water 
supply to eastern Kinshasa.  Tax and fee receipts at the 
Port of Matadi have increased since the installation of the 
World Bank funded guichet unique in mid-2003.  Japan and 
Belgium will disburse USD 1 million in food aid to at-risk 
families in Katanga, Equateur, and Kasai provinces.  The 
World Bank released USD 42.5 million to the GDRC to pay back 
a portion of its domestic debt.  End Summary. 
 
MONETARY AND PRICE UPDATE 
 
2. Prices have been relatively stable, but show signs of a 
light increase on certain foodstuffs.  The combined problems 
of low water levels on the Congo River during the dry season 
and the recent collapse of the Mai-Ndombe bridge on the main 
land route from Bandundu province to Kinshasa (see para 10) 
could result in a scarcity of certain staple foods on the 
Kinshasa market. Corn prices have already risen from FC 
80/unit to FC 180/unit. (Note. Unit used in the Embassy 
price survey is a non-standard local unit of measurement. 
End Note.) 
 
3. No significant changes have been seen in the rate of 
exchange over the past two weeks. Rates in eastern cities 
remain slightly higher (FC 400-410 to the USD) due to 
continuing tensions. However, the official, and most 
parallel market rates remain at approximately FC 390 to the 
USD. 
 
MACROECONOMIC CLIMATE 
 
DRC ECONOMY SHOWS IMPROVEMENT FOR 2003 
 
4. Ministries in the financial and economic sectors 
displayed the successes of the GDRC\'s economic program in a 
27 July 2004 cabinet meeting.  Highlights of the annual 
reports for 2003 include: a 5.6 percent GDP increase; annual 
inflation of 4.4 percent (Note. Embassy price survey showed 
an inflation rate of 7 percent. End Note.) and a   year to 
date inflation rate of 2.7 percent for 2004; exchange rate 
stability at FC 388 to the USD; a positive real interest 
rate for the first time in several years; doubled foreign 
exchange holdings; and a 40 percent increase in GDRC 
revenues. 
 
MINING 
 
BRAZZAVILLE SHUTDOWN DRIVES UP DRC DIAMOND EXPORTS 
 
5. The CEEC reported DRC diamond exports of 2.7 million 
carats valued at USD 81.4 million for July 2004.  DRC 
diamond exports usually total between USD 27 and 35 million 
per month.  CEEC attributes the substantial increase in 
exports to the 9 July 2004 exclusion of the Republic of 
Congo (Brazzaville) from the Kimberley Process certification 
scheme. 
 
BANKING 
 
BANKS\' CURRENCY HOLDINGS INCREASE 
 
6. The GDRC Central Bank (BCC) reported a reduction in 
currency circulation outside the banking sector from 50 
percent to 30 percent.  (Comment.  This reflects primarily 
increased commercial deposits by businesses in the DRC. 
Commercial banks still largely do not issue personal 
checking accounts. This is positive sign for the DRC economy 
but falls short of signaling renewed confidence in the 
banking sector among the general population.  End Comment.) 
 
MANUFACTURING 
 
DRC, NAMIBIA, ZAMBIA ESTABLISH COPPER CABLE VENTURE 
 
7. DRC Minister of Mines Eugene Diomi Ndongala announced 
that he signed a joint-venture agreement with his 
counterparts in the Zambian and Namibian Ministries of Mines 
on 23 July 2004. This multilateral agreement will establish 
a copper cable plant in Walvis Bay, Namibia.  The plant will 
operate as an export-processing zone, and will receive raw 
materials from each of the three countries. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
TENDER FOR DRC-ZAMBIA POWER INFRASTRUCTURE WORK 
 
8. The Bureau Central de Coordination (BCECO) has issued an 
open tender for construction and rehabilitation work on the 
DRC electrical power infrastructure. Work in the DRC will 
include rehabilitation of the 500kV transmission lines 
between Inga and Kolwezi, the construction of new 220kV 
transmission lines, and the installation of a 
telecommunications network between Inga and Kolwezi. 
Additional work will repair transmission lines in the 
electricity export corridor between the DRC and Zambia.  The 
World Bank has provided USD 178 million to finance this 
project. 
EIGHT REHABILITATED WATER PUMPS IN EAST KINSHASA 
 
9. The ICRC funded the rehabilitation and reinstallation of 
eight commercial water pumps used by Regideso (national 
water company) to supply running water to eastern Kinshasa. 
Four pumps have been installed at the N\'Djili intake and 
four at the Kingabwa water treatment station.  The two 
locations had been operating at half capacity since the late 
1990s, leaving many Kinshasans without regular access to 
running water.  The new pumps will increase N\'Djili\'s output 
to 220,000 cubic meters/day and will supply some 4 million 
people. 
 
TRANSPORTATION 
 
MAI-NDOMBE BRIDGE COLLAPSES 
 
10. The bridge over the Mai-Ndombe River on National Road 
No. 2 collapsed on 28 July 2004.  The collapse severed the 
primary land transportation route from Bandundu province to 
Kinshasa, and has resulted in a scarcity of staple 
commodities in the city.  Office des Routes (OR - national 
road maintenance and planning authority) has sent a repair 
team to the site. Office des Routes expects to complete 
repairs by the end of the week of August 1-7, 2004.  The 
primary bridge over the Mai-Ndombe River was destroyed in 
1997 by retreating FAZ.  The Italian government financed 
construction of a temporary bridge, to be used until the 
primary bridge could be repaired.  However, repairs were 
never completed, and the primary bridge remains impassable. 
OR is working to repair the temporary bridge and has offered 
no plan to rebuild the primary bridge. 
 
PORT OF MATADI AGENCIES INCREASE RECEIPTS 
 
11. In the year since the installation of the World Bank- 
funded guichet unique, Port of Matadi customs and tax 
agencies have reported significant receipt increases. 
According to Ofida\'s provincial director Mr. Mwepu, receipts 
increased 67 percent at Ofida (Customs), 180 percent at 
Direction Gnrale des Recettes Administratives et 
Domaniales (DGRAD - Government Fees and Receipts Authority), 
70 percent at Office de Gestion de Fret Maritime (OGEFREM - 
- 
Maritime Freight Authority), 50 percent at Le Fond de 
Promotion de l\'Industrie (FPI), and 20 percent at Direction 
Generale des Impots (DGI - Tax Authority).  Mr. Mwepu 
attributed the increases to the reorganization and 
computerization of the port\'s customs and tax processes. 
Additionally, Ofida hopes to install similar guichets 
uniques for their operations at Kasumbalesa and Mwene-Ditu. 
 
AGRICULTURE 
 
JAPAN AND BELGIUM TO ASSIST CONGOLESE AGRICULTURE 
 
12. Local press reports that Japan and Belgium have agreed 
to provide USD 1 million in agricultural aid to Congolese 
families in Equateur, Kasai, and Katanga provinces as the 
second stage of a larger food security program in which the 
donor countries will eventually distribute USD 3.5 million 
in aid.  The second stage of the program involves 
distribution of some 120 tons of seeds, 24,000 hoes and 
machetes, and several thousand ducks to families deemed at 
risk of malnutrition.  Each family will receive enough 
supplies to cultivate 250 square meters of land and 
supplement their diet with protein from meat and eggs.  The 
donor countries will also provide technical assistance and 
monitoring via regular consultation with beneficiary 
families. 
 
ZAMBIA TO EXPORT CORN TO THE DRC 
 
13. Zambian Deputy Agricultural Minister Chance Kabaghe 
reported that Zambia has agreed to export some 120,000 
metric tons of surplus corn to four countries, including the 
DRC. 
 
HEALTH 
 
SUSPECTED PLAGUE KILLS 58 IN ITURI 
 
14. Local health officials have reported 58 deaths and 1,042 
infections of suspected plague in Ituri since the beginning 
of this year.  WHO officials cite poor food storage 
facilities and displacement due to continuing violence in 
the region as primary contributors to the outbreak.  Most of 
the infections are believed to be bubonic plague, with a 
small minority being pneumonic plague.  Local committees 
have been established to sensitize the public to the problem 
and sanitize the homes of infected persons.  Plague 
infections have been reported in Ituri since the 1920s. 
According to the WHO, recent cases represent a significant, 
but not alarming, increase in the infection rate. 
 
AID 
 
WORLD BANK ASSISTS GDRC WITH INTERNAL DEBT 
 
15. Bavon Nkubiri of la Commission de la Dette Interieuer de 
l\'Etat (Internal Debt Commission) reported that the World 
Bank released USD 42.5 million to the GDRC to repay debts to 
individuals or businesses accrued by the state before, 
during, and after the 1997-2001 war.  A delegation from the 
Ministry of Finance was dispatched to Bukavu in late July to 
begin collecting claims from citizens and business-owners.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  A MONUC official based in Katanga province 
recently visited Shinkolobwe, a local mining area and source 
of uranium, and expressed concern to Kinshasa-based diplomats 
about possible illegal uranium-related mining activity. 
Although Post sees no cause for immediate alarm, Shinkolobwe 
is definitely a long-term problem, because the Congo\'s weak 
state institutions and easily corrupted officials cannot be 
counted upon to secure the mine site.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
MONUC Tries to Investigate Shinkolobwe 
-------------------------------------- 
2. (C) On July 23, MONUC/Lubumbashi chief Magda Gonzales 
briefed P5 plus South African and Belgian diplomats on her 
recent visit to the mining center at Shikolobwe, in Katanga 
province.  (Note:  Shinkolobwe is the source of the uranium 
used by the USG to develop and manufacture the original 
atomic bombs used during WW2.  End Note.)  She provided a 
written report in French, forwarded reftel.  Gonzales, a 
geologist from University of Lubumbashi named Prof. Loris, 
and a Radio Okapi journalist traveled o/a July 14 to the city 
of Likasi and the mining site at Shinkolobwe, to investigate 
a reported cave-in that killed nine and injured possibly a 
dozen more.  Gonzales\' group first visited four survivors at 
Daco Hospital in Likasi.  The survivors were \"in bad shape,\" 
she said, and their skin was green--which the professor told 
her was a sign of radiation poisoning.  She added that the 
attending physician said the four men would be dead within 
six months (NFI).  Gonzales later said that other artisanal 
miners in the area reportedly have developed cancerous tumors. 
 
3. (C) The group next proceeded to the reported accident site 
at Shinkolobwe (NFI).  Local authorities at first refused 
them entry, then relented, but other officials countermanded 
this closer to the supposed site.  To Gonzales\' surprise, 
members of the GDRC national atomic energy commission and 
officials from the Presidency were already there, with 
\"sophisticated equipment.\"  While Gonzales argued, the latter 
group left to examine the mine\'s apparently disused uranium 
concentrator, but the Radio Okapi journalist secretly 
followed them.  According to Gonzales, the instruments 
carried by the GDRC group signaled a high level of 
radioactivity (NFI) at the concentrator.  In the end, local 
authorities escorted the U.N. team to the supposed accident 
site, but instead led them astray and took them to a 
different area.  When the U.N. team realized this, Gonzales 
said, she decided to leave Shinkolobwe without having seen 
the real accident site. 
 
4. (C) After the aborted visit, Gonzales met with the state 
prosecutor at Kipushi, who reportedly had begun an 
investigation into the accident.  The prosecutor told 
Gonzales he believed a Congolese army officer had sent a 
group of young miners to the uranium site at night, but they 
inadvertently caused the mine to collapse.  The same 
prosecutor also \"confirmed\" that civil, military and local 
security authorities were all engaged in exploiting this 
particular site.  Gonzales added that previously, the foreign 
buyers of illegally-exploited minerals in south Katanga were 
mostly of Pakistani or Indian origin, but that today, they 
tend to be from China or Korea. 
 
5. (C) The Belgian poloff attending the MONUC meeting 
reported that a Lubumbashi-based human rights organization, 
ASADHO, had drafted a report on the accident but later 
\"withdrew it under pressure.\"  He added that the 
International Atomic Energy Agency visited Shinkolobwe only a 
few weeks earlier, and according to the IAEA internal report, 
said there was nothing to be concerned about at Shinkolobwe. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (C) Post has previously reported on Shinkolobwe, and sees 
no cause for immediate alarm.  In our view, MONUC\'s 
\"findings\" in this case are short on detail and therefore far 
from conclusive.  Shinkolobwe is definitely a long-term 
problem, however, because the Congo\'s weak state institutions 
and easily corrupted officials cannot be counted upon to 
secure the mine site.  END COMMENT.

REF: KINSHASA 1456 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROGER MEECE 1.5 (b/d) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  In an informal August 1 meeting with the 
Ambassador, former Foreign Minister Antoine Ghonda (protect) 
observed that he had had growing problems over time with the 
leader of his ostensible party, VP Jean-Pierre Bemba.  In 
addition, Ghonda reported that Ugandan President Museveni had 
become upset at the recent AU summit when Ghonda provided 
little satisfaction in response to Museveni,s desire to 
revive the Lusaka Accord Joint Monitoring Commission (JMC), 
provoking a Museveni complaint to Bemba.  Ghonda acknowledged 
feelings of mixed loyalties to party leader Bemba and DRC 
President Kabiladuring his tenure as Minister.  It was clear, 
however, that Ghonda continues to work closely with Kabila, 
and we would not be surprised to see Ghonda take some new 
official position with Kabila after a suitable interval, 
sealing the official end of his ties with Bemba,s MLC.  In 
the meantime, intra-government relationships have become a 
bit more complicated. End summary. 
 
2. (C)  Former Foreign Minister Antoine Ghonda (please 
protect throughout) stopped by the CMR on August 1 for an 
informal meeting with the Ambassador.  His comments regarding 
his views about scheduled tripartite meetings and 
negotiations for a proposed Joint Verification Mechanism were 
reported ref.  This cable summarizes his account of factors 
leading to his dismissal as Foreign Minister by Vice 
President and MLC party leader Jean-Pierre Bemba and related 
comments. 
 
Bemba,s Man in the Ministry - Sort of 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (C)  The Ambassador asked Ghonda to summarize what factors 
had led to Bemba,s decision the previous week to replace 
Ghonda as Foreign Minister  (Note: Under terms of the DRC 
transition accords, individual factions have the right to 
name and remove Ministers and other officials &allocated8 
to them.  The Foreign Minister position has been designated 
as an MLC position, and therefore MLC President Bemba has the 
right to make the change with or without concurrence from 
President Kabila.  End note).  Ghonda said that he had been 
having growing problems with Bemba for some time, charging 
that Bemba had often had contacts or arrangements with 
foreign officials without informing Ghonda, sometimes putting 
Ghonda in an awkward spot.  As an example, he said that Bemba 
had arranged the purchase of Charles Taylor,s plane without 
Ghonda knowing.  He became aware of the situation when Bemba 
asked for Ghonda,s help to recover a plane Bemba said was in 
Nigeria for servicing.  For whatever reason, the Nigerians 
seemed to be balking about releasing the plane, and Bemba 
wanted Ghonda to help.  At the time, Ghonda said he knew 
nothing about a Taylor connection, and assumed it was a Bemba 
personal aircraft which happened to be in Nigeria.   He 
therefore phoned Nigerian FM Adeniji about the matter.  After 
some difficult moments, Adeniji reportedly asked Ghonda if he 
realized that the aircraft was Taylor,s.  Embarrassed, 
Ghonda admitted he did not, checking back with Bemba who told 
Ghonda that he must have forgotten to mention that fact 
earlier.  Ghonda said, however, that over time, it was clear 
this was how Bemba operated, often leaving him out of the 
loop when dealing with sensitive issues.   In an aside, 
Ghonda firmly asserted that the Taylor plane was not a DRC 
government aircraft, nor did the transaction have anything to 
do with the MLC as a party.  He emphasized the reported 
purchase was strictly a Bemba personal deal. 
 
4. (C) Later in the conversation, Ghonda acknowledged that he 
had mixed feelings about his own dealings with Bemba.  He 
asserted Bemba viewed Ghonda first and foremost as his own 
representative, wanting for example to be informed first of 
important developments or communications.  Ghonda, by 
contrast, felt that as a minister of the government, he 
needed to be able to communicate with President Kabila 
privately, and certainly felt an obligation to convey 
official messages first to Kabila, followed as appropriate by 
reports to Bemba, the other Vice Presidents, and other GDRC 
officials.  Ghonda indicated that he and Bemba never reached 
a mutual understanding in this area.  The Ambassador asked 
about Ghonda,s original affiliation with Bemba, including 
the how and why of his first joining the MLC.  Ghonda 
provided a lengthy account centered on efforts by then-MLC 
Secretary General Olivier Kamitatu, a long-time Ghonda 
 
SIPDIS 
friend, to get Ghonda involved in the DRC transition, with 
the MLC offering the best prospects.  Ghonda noted he had had 
contacts with the MLC and Bemba stretching back for some 
years, although he added that he had some links with Kabila 
and other leaders as well. 
 
The Museveni Factor 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador also asked what exactly had happened at 
the July AU summit in Addis prompting widespread reports that 
Ugandan President Museveni had asked for Ghonda,s dismissal. 
 Ghonda reported that he was active in meetings during the AU 
summit.  At one point, while in a meeting with Namibian 
President Nujoma, he received a message that Museveni wanted 
to see him urgently.  Going directly to Museveni following 
the Nujoma meeting, Ghonda reported finding an apparently 
agitated Museveni impatiently rocking back and forth on his 
feet.  According to Ghonda, Museveni immediately accused 
Ghonda of seeking to block Ugandan efforts to revive the 
Joint Monitoring Commission (JMC) established under the 
original Lusaka Accord, and asked Ghonda what he found 
objectionable about Lusaka.  Ghonda said that in this and at 
least one subsequent meeting, he sought to finesse the matter 
by affirming that he had no mandate to discuss the issue, 
suggesting that if Museveni felt this to be a major issue, he 
dispatch FM Mbabazi to Kinshasa for talks with Kabila. 
Ghonda said that Museveni was clearly unhappy with Ghonda,s 
responses, and said that a Museveni aide later told him that 
&the Mzee8 was angry.  Continuing, Ghonda said that 
Museveni tried floating some compromise proposals in a later 
meeting, to which Ghonda provided similar answers, likely 
increasing Museveni,s unhappiness. 
 
6. (C) Ghonda commented that he believed Museveni,s JMC 
ideas were not useful, potentially causing major 
complications relative to MONUC and pending negotiations for 
a Joint Verification Mechansim (JVM).  He speculated that 
Museveni,s interests were prompted by the fact that there 
are now a number of factions in DRC,s northeast Ituri region 
which did not exist when Lusaka was originally signed, nor 
when some of the subsequent agreements were reached.  By 
reviving a new form of the JMC now, he thought, Museveni 
might be seeking to increase his influence through new allies 
and proxies.  In any event, he certainly did not have the 
authority in Addis to discuss the issue. 
 
7. (C) Ghonda said he thought Museveni probably conveyed his 
unhappiness with Ghonda to Bemba, adding that that Bemba 
continues to regard Museveni with great respect and that the 
two maintain a close relationship.  He believes that 
undoubtedly the Museveni complaint was a factor leading to 
Bemba,s decision to change Foreign Ministers. 
 
And the Politics of Sharing 
-------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The third specific issue Ghonda cited was a debate 
long underway about the distribution of the DRC,s 
Ambassadorial slots.  Ghonda reported that he believed a 
number of key slots should be retained for career diplomats. 
In particular, he observed that the Kampala and Kigali 
embassies could not be given to any of the DRC,s transition 
parties without major complications, and that he was very 
concerned as well about key posts in Washington, New York, 
London, and Brussels.  Much of this was in conflict with 
Bemba,s wishes, who felt Ghonda was insufficiently attentive 
to Bemba and MLC interests.  Ghonda claimed that the impasse 
with Bemba, as well as claims by other parties, led 
eventually to the creation of a commission which recently 
presented a set of recommendations that Ghonda asserted 
coincided very closely to his own original proposals.  While 
all parties have now accepted this recommendations, the 
exercise served as one more point of Bemba disenchantment 
with Ghonda. 
 
Political Implications 
------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Ghonda made it clear that he felt no continuing 
attachment to Bemba.  He reported that as of August 1 he had 
not yet even spoken with Bemba since his return from abroad. 
He said that Olivier Kamitatu had conveyed an offer from 
Bemba to appoint Ghonda to the Agriculture Ministry.  Ghonda 
said he rejected the idea, telling Kamitatu that he thought 
the problems he had working with Bemba would continue 
regardless of the specific portfolio.  In addition, Ghonda 
observed that Bemba would not even have made the offer if he 
didn,t feel he needed Ghonda.  Expanding, Ghonda said that 
Bemba had hurt himself with the Bakongo and Bandundu 
communities by his actions, including Ghonda,s dismissal. 
In addition, in the face of the widely reported Museveni 
involvement, Bemba also badly undercut the nationalist 
credentials he has been working very hard to establish. 
Ghonda was adamant that he had no desire to renew a Bemba tie. 
 
10. (C) Ghonda acknowledged that he continues to have ongoing 
contacts with Kabila, admitting that one of the three 
cellular phones he carried was  a &red line8 for Kabila,s 
use.  He said, for example, that he had been working the 
previous couple of days, among other things, to prepare 
condolence letter(s) and make other arrangements for Kabila 
relative to funeral arrangements being made in Libreville for 
Congo (Brazzaville) President Sassou,s son-in-law who had 
just died.  Ghonda denied having any current designated 
position, however.  In fact, he said he had made clear to 
Kabila that he would like to participate in an executive 
training seminar to be held in Boston during the latter part 
of August.  Only after that when some of the dust had settled 
would it seem suitable for something to be formalized. 
 
11. (C) For now, Ghonda said that Kabila refuses to have 
anything to do with new Foreign Minister Ramazani, Bemba,s 
new choice.  Ghonda said he is working to try to soften 
Kabila,s stance, albeit with little success to-date.  Ghonda 
said that he personally has no problems with Ramazani, 
although Ramazani would presumably face the same sort of 
conflicting pressures as Minister that Ghonda had felt. 
 
Comment: Added Complexities 
-------------------------------------- 
 
12. (C) Comment:  Ghonda,s account provides some interesting 
insights to the way the &national unity8 government in 
Kinshasa is operating, and specifically into the undoubtedly 
strained Kabila/Bemba relationship.  As well, Ghonda,s 
observations about Bemba,s concern about support in Bacongo 
and Bandundu are well-founded.  There has been recent street 
talk that Bemba has also been pushing for removal of Mines 
Minister Diomi, a designated &opposition8 Minister not 
under Bemba,s control.  While Diomi,s removal might 
arguably be a plus in terms of the DRC,s economic interests, 
Diomi is the only remaining major Bakongo figure of 
Ministerial rank.  This has prompted renewed complaints from 
the relatively well-organized Bakongo community of being 
marginalized, all of which undoubtedly works to Bemba,s 
disfavor.  For now, the immediate effect of Ghonda,s 
replacement is to complicate further relationships inside the 
government.  Ghonda,s comments about Ramazani also sound 
about right, with all signs indicating that Ramazani does not 
have any meaningful contact with Kabila.  We and other 
foreign governments will need to exercise some increased 
deftness as well to maintain multiple channels of 
communications without getting drawn needlessly into internal 
Congolese battles.  End comment.

1. (C) Summary. Ituri District Commissioner questions GDRC 
commitment to new Ituri administration. She asserts that 
despite repeated pleas, Kinshasa has yet to provide her with 
a salary or with the basic resources necessary for her 
administration to function. End Summary. 
 
Good Intentions Insufficient Resources 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Poloff met with new Ituri District Commissioner 
Petronille Vaweka, on August 6 to discuss her first few weeks 
as the new head of Ituri\'s administration (reftel). Vaweka 
said that she has yet to receive a salary from the national 
government and her administration lacks the basic resources 
necessary to function. She has asked the GDRC multiple times 
to provide her with financial support to begin her work, but 
has not seen any concrete action. In her own words \"Kinshasa 
is not serious about Ituri\". 
 
3. (C) Vaweka\'s new administration lacks basic items such as 
office supplies, furniture, fuel for transportation and 
communications equipment. Only the district administrators of 
Mahagi and Mamabasa have been deployed to their respective 
areas. Those of Aru, Irumu, and Njugu currently lack the 
means and the security to assume their new posts. Vaweka 
feels that Ituri has substantial economic potential to help 
itself, the Orientale Province and the DRC, but it first 
needs basic support from the national government to organize 
its affairs. 
 
4. (C) Vaweka indicated that she was also concerned about her 
personal safety, as she lacked any type of protection in an 
area where she could be targeted by individuals who oppose 
her administration. She noted that she elected to keep her 
family in Kinshasa due to the lack of security in Bunia. 
Vaweka would like to see the integrated FARDC brigade and a 
new police unit deployed to Ituri to increase security, but 
not without appropriate logistical support and a government 
commitment to pay their salaries. She said that deployment of 
a security force without appropriate support could turn them 
into another armed group. She feels that the government has 
the resources to support Ituri but lacks the will to use them. 
 
 
Demobilization Plan not Moving Forward 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Vaweka said that the disarmament and demobilization 
plan for Ituri (DDR) is supposed to start on September 2nd. 
However, she is skeptical about the possible success of DDR 
without substantial government involvement. Currently, her 
civilian administration lacks the resources to support or 
even follow DDR plans around the district. Additionally, 
armed militias have expressed an unwillingness to disarm in 
the absence of a concise mechanism to provide them protection 
once they have given up their arms. At this point, such a 
mechanism does not exist and the GDRC has not taken any steps 
to develop one. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) Vaweka is one of those rare public officials in the 
Congo who has the integrity, determination, and courage to 
make a difference, even when faced with substantial 
obstacles. However, it will be very difficult for her to be 
an effective administrator in Ituri without initial support 
from the national government. The GDRC has sent several 
inter-ministerial delegations to Ituri to express government 
support for the region. Yet as Vaweka said \"it is time for 
Kinshasa to stop making promises and to take concrete actions 
to support the recovery and reintegration of Ituri into the 
national economy.\"

SUBJECT: CONGO-KINSHASA BUSINESS VISA FACILITATION PROGRAM 
 
REF: 04 STATE 166108 
 
1.   Summary.  A low level of trade between the United 
States and Congo-Kinshasa, a short average NIV appointment 
wait time and open channels between the consular and 
economic sections form the basis of informal mechanisms used 
at post to facilitate business visa issuance.  Legitimate 
business travelers face little to no impediments obtaining 
visas by following standard procedures.  Per reftel, post 
will reach out to local American businesses with interests 
in Congo-Kinshasa to solicit feedback on current mechanisms 
and to explore ways to further facilitate legitimate 
business travel to the United States.  End summary. 
 
2.   Years of civil war and mismanagement have left Congo- 
Kinshasa one of the poorest countries in the world despite 
its abundance of natural resources.  Trade between Congo- 
Kinshasa and the United States is comparatively small -- 
approximately US 119 million, most of which is from the 
petroleum sector.  Principal American companies with 
interests here include Chevron-Texaco, General Motors, Ford 
and Caterpillar.  Manufacturers of cellular 
telecommunications equipment are potential sources of 
business with the United States, while American sellers of 
used aircraft sometimes have need for Congolese business 
visitors. 
 
3.   NIV workload in Kinshasa is approximately 3,200 
applicants per year and appointment wait time averages three 
to five days.  Legitimate business travelers with proper 
documents and a history of prior travel receive full and 
timely attention for visa requests.  In instances where an 
unknown or poorly documented person is applying for a visa 
for business travel to the United States, the U.S. firm 
often contacts the consular section either directly or 
through the economic section to confirm the legitimacy of 
the proposed trip.  With high levels of NIV fraud and a high 
refusal rate, vice consul prefers to individually examine 
any questionable applications or new travelers. 
 
4.   Based on these factors, post\'s standard visa 
appointment procedures and informal verification mechanisms 
for business travel have well served the American business 
community here.  There are no lengthy delays for prospective 
travelers to obtain a visa interview, and cooperation 
between the consular and economic sections on identifying 
legitimate business travel is good. 
 
5.   Per reftel, post will look at formalizing and expanding 
these mechanisms by inquiring with local representatives of 
American companies about additional measure to facilitate 
business visas.  Embassy-sponsored business roundtables will 
be ideal forums to gather such feedback.  Post will invite 
interested companies to submit names and contact information 
of staff that consular personnel could contact in order to 
verify the bona fides of prospective travelers and the 
legitimacy of the travel agenda.  Other pertinent 
information such as the names and passport numbers of any 
regular travelers also could be included in these post- 
maintained files.

1. (C) Summary: During Ambassador Meece\'s August 6 initial 
call on Vice President Azarias Ruberwa, Ruberwa provided a 
tour d\'horizon, highlighting his concerns about the current 
situation. He outlined a series of challenges facing the 
transition, suggested a political solution to the Nkunda 
problem, and called for a stronger MONUC mandate. Ruberwa 
referenced the need to manage difficult DRC/Rwandan 
relations, but also referred to potential problematic Rwandan 
military involvement, for example in support of Nkunda\'s 
forces. The Ambassador concurred on the importance of 
ensuring the transition\'s success, and reiterated USG 
support. He pointed out potential pitfalls to a political 
\'reward\' for Nkunda. The Vice President, who seemed relaxed 
and comfortable throughout the meeting, said he planned to 
leave August 6 for a week in the Kivus. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador accompanied by PolOff made an 
introductory call on VP Ruberwa August 6. Ruberwa\'s political 
advisor was also present for the meeting, which lasted a bit 
over an hour. Ruberwa opened the substantive discussion with 
a tour d\'horizon of the current situation in the country, 
highlighting his areas of concern. In Ruberwa\'s opinion, a 
lack of trust and confidence among the major composantes, a 
failure by certain parties to respect power-sharing 
principles, delays integrating the army, managing DRC-Rwanda 
relations, and resolving the Nkunda problem are major 
challenges facing the transition. On a personal level, 
Ruberwa said it is difficult to work in an environment where 
his motivations and actions are always considered suspect by 
both RCD hardliners and other government composantes. Ruberwa 
told Ambassador that he planned to leave later the same day 
for a week in the Kivus where he intends to meet with a wide 
range of people, even \'extremists\' in Bukavu, Uvira, Burundi 
(Banyamulenge refugees) and possibly Goma. (Note. Ruberwa 
arrived in Bukavu on August 7. End note.) 
 
Internal Dynamics 
----------------- 
 
3. (C) The Vice President sees the fall of Bukavu and the 
resultant Nkunda/ Mutebusi problem as the most serious crisis 
the transition government has faced. He believes that if it 
is mishandled, it could derail the transition. In Ruberwa\'s 
view, there are two possible solutions---political or 
military. As Nkunda is a member of the RCD and part of his 
ethnic community, Ruberwa prefers a political solution, 
perhaps sending them to school overseas for a few years. More 
importantly, in his opinion, a military solution is unlikely 
to be successful because Nkunda knows the terrain, soldiers 
in the N. Kivu Military Region are mostly Rwandaphone and 
likely to side with Nkunda, and if fighting spreads into 
Goma, Rutshuru and Masisi, Rwanda might get involved. 
 
4. (C) In a subsequent response to Ruberwa\'s points, the 
Ambassador strongly reiterated USG support for the transition 
process, and underscored the need for ongoing dialogue 
between the major factions and leaders. He observed that 
everyone involved was well aware of the depth of mutual 
mistrust and the difficulty of implementing a peace process 
from the time of early negotiations. He emphasized that 
substantial progress had nonetheless already been achieved, 
making it even more important for all parties and leaders to 
maintain open channels of communication. Ruberwa acknowledged 
the point. Regarding Nkunda, the Ambassador noted the perils 
of \'rewarding\' Nkunda and thereby creating potential 
incentives for other would-be rebels. Ruberwa did not 
challenge this, but questioned whether any other viable 
solutions existed. 
 
5. (C) Ruberwa said delays integrating the army were 
\'inexcusable,\' and elections will be impossible without 
military reform. He accused the PPRD of maintaining parallel 
military power structures, and complained about high-level 
corruption and mismanagement, which he sought to characterize 
as being at the worst levels ever. The Ambassador observed 
that corruption is a long-standing major problem in the DRC; 
Ruberwa concurred. 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador made an oblique reference to problems 
within the RCD, but said that it did not seem the best time 
to discuss the issue. Ruberwa picked up on the reference, and 
said it would be a useful topic for the \'next meeting.\' 
 
External Dynamics 
----------------- 
 
7. (C) In order to improve DRC-Rwanda relations, Ruberwa 
suggested dedicating 2-3 FARDC brigades to disarming the 
Interahamwe, preferably with MONUC logistical assistance. He 
called for a stronger MONUC mandate and opined that MONUC 
should use its 10,000 soldiers to forcibly disarm foreign 
combatants. He underscored the need for a more capable, and 
by implication, larger MONUC force. The Ambassador observed 
that we and all others were awaiting the UN SYG\'s report and 
its recommendations regarding the future of MONUC. Once we 
had that in hand, we could formulate our response to the 
proposals. He pointed out, however, that it is important for 
DPKO and the SYG\'s office to prepare recommendations that are 
realistic and can be implemented. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Ruberwa appeared relaxed and comfortable throughout 
the meeting, and made several references to Ambassador\'s 
previous time in Kinshasa. Ruberwa was frank in assessing the 
military situation in the east, including the likely 
sympathies of local soldiers and commanders, as well as the 
real possibility of direct Rwandan involvement. He clearly 
was looking for a way out to avoid what he sees as a 
potential military mess for Kinshasa, but could only come up 
with the dubious idea of an Nkunda and/or Mutebusi 
scholarship. Ruberwa is obviously in a very vulnerable 
position, and he made it clear he feels the pressure. His 
week-long trip east is undoubtedly motivated to a great 
extent by his need to shore up a position relative to the 
RCD-Goma organization, especially given the overt challenge 
posed by Bizima Karaha and seven other \'dissident\' 
parliamentarians. It is less clear whether he is also seeking 
to do anything to address directly the problem of Nkunda 
while in the region.

Information. Not for internet distribution. 
 
2. (SBU) Embassy Kinshasa has reviewed the two applications 
for political risk insurance that No.1 Contracting 
Corporation of Ashley, PA has submitted to OPIC. Post opines 
that there are no current political or economic difficulties 
associated with either the company or the two projects. Both 
bids that No.1 Contracting submitted are for World Bank 
funded infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction 
projects. Hence, the source of funding is guaranteed. DRC 
treatment of foreign contractors varies, however, the bid 
process for such projects is carried out according to World 
Bank norms. Once commencing the project, the contractor will 
likely encounter some bureaucratic delays possibly related to 
licensing and authorization, taxes, and/or relationships with 
local chieftains. Logistical difficulties (e.g. consistent 
supply of gasoline, cement, etc) will further complicate 
project success. 
 
3. (SBU) The following reesponds to the specific questions 
listed in the referenced email: 
 
a. Post does not foresee any negative public or host 
government sentiment toward the projects. 
 
b. The projects are unlikely to have negative impacts on U.S. 
policy and interests in the DRC. 
 
c. Post has no knowledge of accusations of improprieties on 
the part of No.1 Contracting. 
 
d. Post does not believe that the projects could potentially 
result in serious adverse environmental effects beyond those 
normally encountered in heavy construction projects. 
 
e. These projects fall under the World Bank\'s Emergency 
Multisectoral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Plan. Hence, 
they are not in conflict with the DRC\'s economic objectives 
and welfare. 
 
f. Post is unaware of potential uneconomic use of raw 
materials or labor. 
 
g. These projects will not have an adverse affect on the 
DRC\'s balance of payments. The whole of funding is provided 
by the World Bank.

ASSISTANCE TO THE DRC, JULY 21, 2004 
 
1. On July 21, 2004 PAS Kinshasa distributed a press release 
on the U.S. military assistance to the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo. The English text of the release is as follows: 
 
\"The U.S. Embassy is pleased to announce the successful 
visit of a team from the Defense Institute of International 
Legal Studies (DIILS) to Kinshasa. This team visited 
Kinshasa from July 12-16th. The purpose of this visit was to 
plan a series of approximately four seminars to be held in 
the DRC over the next two years, beginning this October. 
DIILS promotes dialogue and exchange between the U.S. 
military and foreign military and civilian authorities in 
order to help develop professional and responsible armed 
services. DIILS helps develop military justice systems, 
emphasizing the importance of the rule of law as well as the 
key role of civil-military relations, including civilian 
oversight and control of the military. DIILS will also bring 
Congolese military and civilian personnel to the U.S. for 
training. 
 
The visit of the DIILS team marks a major step forward in 
the resumption of military cooperation between the DRC and 
the U.S.  The USG is engaging in a number of other military 
educational and exchange programs with the DRC, and it looks 
forwards to an expanded military relationship with the DRC, 
reflecting the DRC\'s key role in bringing peace and 
stability to the Great Lakes region.\"

Kinshasa newspapers listed below. The general headline for 
these placements was \"Assistance Militaire du Gouvernement

Ms. Mukwamputu has been working for Femme Plus in Bukavu since 
1997.  Femme Plus is perhaps the major NGO in the DRC dealing with 
HIV/AIDS and women\'s issues.  HIV/AIDS is a particularly serious 
concern in the Bukavu area.  This area has one of the highest 
infection rates in the DRC due to the conflict in the eastern 
Congo and the routine use of rape as a weapon of war.  Ms. 
Mukwamputu will benefit greatly from the knowledge she will gain 
from this program.  The Country Team has approved this nominee.

Mr. Tshibinda has been the legal advisor to the University of 
Lubumbashi since 1999.  The University of Lubumbashi is the second 
university in the DRC, after the University of Kinshasa.  Academic 
leadership in the DRC is often hampered by the fact that 
appointments to leadership positions are based on cronyism and 
personal and political connections.  Mr. Tshibinda appears to be 
an exception to this.  He should continue to advance within the 
Congolese higher education system.  His participation in this 
program will be of great long-term benefit to the Congo.  The 
Country Team has approved this nominee.

The DRC is the scene of some of the worst human rights violations 
in the world, particularly in the eastern part of the country. 
The lack of respect for and protection of human rights is 
exacerbated by the Congo\'s lack of experience with a democratic 
government.  This project will allow a group of Congolese human 
rights activists to explore how human rights are promoted and 
protected in the U.S. and to see how the American experience can 
be applied in the DRC.  This project should explore the role of a 
responsible and responsive government in promoting and protecting 
human rights, including the key role played by an independent 
judiciary.  Other topics for exploration include the vital element 
of transparency in government institutions and the role-played by 
an independent and professional media.  The group should also 
examine the role that economic development plays in the promotion 
and protection of human rights. 
END MEMO POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO POST-RCMD: 
The group should visit government institutions involved in the 
promotion and protection of human rights.  This should include law 
enforcement institutions and the military in order to see how 
these groups incorporate respect for human rights into their work. 
The group should visit NGOs, both those involved in human rights 
in general and those involved specifically with African human 
rights issues.  The group should also meet with federal and state 
judges and other legal personnel in order to examine the vital 
role played by the American judiciary in the promotion and 
protection of human rights.  The group should also visit both 
print and electronic media organizations to see how the media acts 
as a check on abuse of human rights.  The group should also look 
at the role academic institutions play in publicizing human rights 
concerns and in developing approaches for dealing with human 
rights issues.

Province.  He is currently working with the Civil Society in 
promoting and protecting human rights in Oriental.  Kisangani and 
Oriental have also been scenes of major human rights violations 
due to their natural resources and strategic locations.  Kisangani 
is the third largest city in the DRC.  It is the major prize in 
the eastern Congo and it has therefore been fought over many times 
by outside armies and by Congolese armed groups.  Mr. Ikenge will 
be able to use in particular knowledge gained from this program in 
developing the role private human rights groups can take in 
lobbying and working with government institutions in promoting and

Ms. Cibalonza works as a lawyer and as a volunteer for several 
NGOs dealing with human rights and development issues. 
Particularly in the eastern Congo, women are a mainstay of the 
economy and society.  This situation is made worse by the fact 
that many men in this region have been killed in the Congolese 
conflict or drawn off to serve in the many armed groups present in 
this region.  This further increases the economic and 
developmental burden placed on women in this region.  Ms. 
Cibalonza will thus benefit from seeing development strategies for 
women, particularly for disadvantaged women, as they are applied 
in the U.S.

SUBJECT: NKUNDA STALEMATE ENTERS THIRD MONTH 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Meghan Moore for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary:  As of August 13, despite several weeks of 
low-level skirmishes, the FARDC had not launched a 
large-scale offensive against rebel commander Laurent Nkunda. 
Much of the FARDC command structure, including N. Kivu 
military commander General Obedi, descended on Bukavu August 
10 for consultations with the military field commander, 
General Mabe. On August 11, General Obedi returned to Goma, 
and the others returned to Kisangani. On August 7, VP Ruberwa 
arrived in Bukavu for what was to be a week-long visit to the 
Kivus. The government seems to be inching closer to the 
\'military solution\' to the Nkunda dilemma, while still 
pursuing negotiated settlements. It is unlikely, however, 
that the FARDC would launch a large-scale military offensive 
until after President Kabila returns from his scheduled trip 
to the SADC summit the week of August 16. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) There have been sustained rumors of an imminent 
large-scale FARDC attack on rebel positions in N. and S. Kivu 
for the past two months, but so far only low-level clashes 
have occurred. On July 31, S. Kivu Military Regional 
Commander General Mabe told polcouns he had received 
instructions from Kinshasa to launch an attack against 
Nkunda\'s positions, but was waiting to execute this order 
because he cannot control Lake Kivu and fears that Rwanda 
will send reinforcements. (Comment:  Monuc reports 
substantiate an ongoing traffic through Dutu of supplies and 
personnel from Rwanda to Nkunda\'s positions.  End Comment.) 
Low-level skirmishes have occurred for several weeks outside 
Kalehe between unidentified elements nominally loyal to 
Nkunda or Serufuli and Mai Mai elements and/or FARDC troops 
loyal to Mabe.  On July 31, the UN Office for Humanitarian 
Coordination estimated that these skirmishes had caused 
31,000 people to flee southwards towards Kalehe and at least 
5,000 IDPs (mostly Rwandaphone) to flee north. On August 12, 
MONUC Bukavu Child Protection Officer told poloff that a vast 
majority of these IDPs were of the BaHavu ethnic group, and 
not Rwandaphone. 
 
3. (C) On August 10, a large group of senior military 
officials, including armed forces chief Lt. Gen. Kisempia, 
intelligence chief BG Didier Etumba, ground forces commander 
Major General Sylvain Mbuki, air force and naval deputy 
commanders, and N. Kivu regional commander BG Obedi arrived 
in Bukavu for meetings with General Mabe. While in Bukavu, 
the group held strategy sessions and toured FARDC front-line 
positions in Kalehe. (Note: It appears that Obedi 
participated in all meetings, after Mbuki issued him an 
ultimatum---Obedi must report to Kinshasa by August 15 with a 
detailed report of the status of his forces, including who is 
likely to be loyal to the FARDC or face the consequences. On 
August 12, Obedi told poloff that he plans to come to 
Kinshasa--he\'s just waiting for Mbuki to set the date. He 
also said he plans to go to Masisi on August 13 to 
investigate Interahamwe activity. End note.)  On August 11, 
General Obedi returned to Goma, and the others returned to 
Kisangani. 
 
Opposing Forces 
--------------- 
 
4. (C) As of early August, MONUC reported that FARDC troops 
were located in central Kalehe and some locations along the 
Kalehe-Minova road (which runs along Lake Kivu). DATT 
estimates total FARDC forces in the area as roughly 15,000 
troops. As of early August, MONUC reported that Nkunda\'s 
troops occupied Minova on Lake Kivu and locations to the 
north of Kalehe, along Lake Kivu, such as Nyabibwe, Dutu, 
Mukwija, Lushebere and Nyamasasa, as well as villages north 
of Bushaku on the High Plateau. DATT estimates that Nkunda 
has access to about 5,000 troop, comprised of about 3,000 
troops in and around Minova (2,000 who came from Bukavu in 
June and about 1,000 who either deserted from the FARDC, were 
forcibly recruited, or were paid to fight), and an additional 
2,000 would probably answer Nkunda\'s call. 
 
Diplomatic Moves 
---------------- 
 
5. (C) Diplomatic initiatives to negotiate Nkunda out of the 
Kivus and into exile have not worked thus far, in part 
because Nkunda does not appear willing to accept exile unless 
it would be to someplace \'nice,\' i.e., Europe or America. 
Developed countries are not interested in offering the 
\'Butcher of Kisangani\' exile. Over time, Nkunda has 
demonstrated that he is an untrustworthy negotiator, which 
makes potential interlocutors even more unwilling to talk to 
him. Although it is possible that either N. Kivu Governor 
Serufuli and/or VP Ruberwa may be attempting to find a 
political solution, they are unlikely to succeed. 
 
6. (C) In response to a recent CIAT letter expressing concern 
about Nkunda, President Kabila told the new British 
Ambassador this week during his credentials ceremony that 
Kabila would be happy to meet with the CIAT following his 
return from the SADC summit next week, but only to discuss 
elections, not Nkunda. (Comment: The subject of Nkunda will 
almost certainly arise in any CIAT meeting with Kabila, if 
only in the guise of an impediment to progress towards 
elections. End comment.) Meanwhile, Monuc SRSG Bill Swing 
reports that Kabila has been in regular contact with 
Serufuli. Serufuli is the wildcard of the local situation, in 
control of a militia that could be a decisive factor in any 
military confrontation. It is unclear what Serufuli is after, 
and entirely conceivable that he is presently unwilling to 
commit to either Kabila or Nkunda, seeking to preserve all 
options until and if a sufficiently attractive option is 
available to him. For now, the uncertain status quo may be 
his preferred choice. 
 
Ruberwa\'s Mission 
------------------ 
 
7. (C) On August 7, VP Ruberwa arrived in Bukavu for what was 
planned to be a week-long visit to the Kivus. (Note: Initial 
reports that an August 7 gun-battle on the Kavumu 
Airport-Bukavu road were between Ruberwa\'s bodyguards and the 
FARDC were untrue. Rather, Ruberwa\'s entourage encountered an 
ongoing scuffle between a renegade Mai Mai commander and 
FARDC troops. End note.) Ruberwa flew August 10 to Kigali, 
and then continued on to Cyangugu where he met with 
Banyamulenge refugees August 11 before returning to Bukavu. 
MONUC Bukavu reported that Ruberwa asked MONUC to join him in 
Cyangugu, but the GOR refused permission for MONUC to cross 
the border. (Note. This travel prohibition continued August 
12. End note.) As of August 12, it appears the Ruberwa will 
not go to Goma as planned due to concerns about his security, 
but will continue on to Burundi to meet with Banyamulenge 
refugees. (Comment: Ruberwa met with President Kabila before 
leaving Kinshasa, and may be on a wider government mission to 
speak to the Rwandans about moving the Joint Verification 
Mechanism forward and conceivably Nkunda. He may also be 
meeting with Burundians to discuss purported Rwanda-Burundi 
military cooperation to hunt the FDLR. End comment.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) As this stalemate has dragged on, the transitional 
government forces have become weaker and less focused. The 
failure to negotiate Nkunda out of his position, coupled with 
the FARDC\'s inability to resupply its troops and maintain 
discipline, is fueling the likelihood of an eventual military 
offensive. The risk remains that relatively large-scale 
fighting could be triggered unintentionally due to 
miscalculations or \'accidents\' arising from large numbers of 
ill-disciplined troops in close proximity who regularly 
engage in low-level clashes. Any planned offensive, however, 
is unlikely to take place until after President Kabila 
returns from his scheduled trip to the SADC summit next week. 
 
9. (C) On paper, neither side appears to have a decisive 
military advantage, and it is unclear whether FARDC efforts 
to bring Obedi back into the fold are either sincere or 
likely to work. Serufuli appears to enjoy his wildcard role, 
but Kabila may be negotiating with him to pre-position 
Serufuli\'s militia members in positions that appear innocuous 
but could be beneficial for the FARDC--althgouh it remains 
unclear what Serufuli might demand in exchange for such 
service. In addition, Kigali continues to fuel uncertainty by 
reiterating its previously expressed \'right\' to reenter the 
DRC, this time in self-defense against an alleged build-up of 
FDLR forces -- although Monuc has seen no evidence of any 
such gathering of FDLR elements.  Absent the all-out 
offensive, we expect to see continued, intermittent low-level 
fighting between combatants in northern S. Kivu. We will 
continue to monitor closely the fluid situation.

SUBJECT: ECONOMIC REPORT - AUG 05 THROUGH AUG 12 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1. Prices remain stable despite the collapse of the Mai- 
Ndombe bridge.  Exchange rates are very stable. 
COPIREP will pay out USD 11.5 million in severance 
packages to liquidate three Congolese banks.  The 
government of the People\'s Republic of China is funding 
construction of a 150 bed hospital in the N\'Djili 
district of Kinshasa.  Unidentified thieves stole 3,000 
meters of electrical transmission cable from SNEL 
lines, disrupting power supply to Kisangani.  The 
African Development Fund will distribute USD 36.3 
million in loans and grants to aid agriculture in Bas- 
Congo and Bandundu provinces.  Norway agreed to forgive 
USD 700,000 of the DRC\'s debt.  A cholera epidemic has 
infected around 600 and killed 56 in Nord-Kivu 
province. 
 
MONETARY AND PRICE UPDATE 
 
2. Prices have only risen approximately 25 percent on 
certain food staples.  Completion of repairs on the Mai- 
Ndombe bridge will alleviated upward pressures. 
 
3. Exchange rates remain very stable.  Effects of the 
recent BCD liquidation appear to have run their course 
on the Kinshasa market.  Rates remain slightly higher 
in the east due to continuing tensions. 
 
BANKING 
 
COPIREP TO DISTRIBUTE USD 11.5 MILLION IN SEVERANCE PAY 
 
4. Le Comite de la Reforme des Enterprises Publique 
(COPIREP, a World Bank-funded corporation designed to 
reform the DRC\'s public enterprises) will pay out USD 
11.5 million in severance packages to workers of three 
banks ordered liquidated by the Banque Centrale du 
Congo (BCC).  The Nouvelle Banque de Kinshasa (NBK), 
Banque Congolaise du Commerce Exterieur (BCCE), and 
Banque de Credit Agricole (BCA) are being liquidated as 
part of the BCC\'s restructuring of the DRC\'s banking 
sector. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
CHINESE FUND HOSPITAL IN N\'DJILI 
 
5. The People\'s Republic of China has funded the 
construction of a 150 bed hospital in the N\'Djili 
district of Kinshasa.  A Chinese engineering firm will 
build the hospital at a cost of USD 6 million. 
 
3,000 METERS OF ELECTRICAL CABLE STOLEN 
 
6. Local press reports that approximately 3,000 meters 
of low-voltage electrical transmission cable was 
unearthed, cut, and stolen near Kisangani, Orientale 
province.  La Societe National d\'Electricite (SNEL) 
claims it is currently unable to replace the stolen 
cable, and says that Kisangani is at risk for power 
outages as a result of the theft. 
 
MBANDAKA AIRPORT REPAIRS COMPLETED 
 
7. Mbandaka airport commander Gedeon Mangolopa reported 
that Mbandaka airport, which was damaged during the 
civil war, has been restored and is now in conformity 
with Congolese air navigation safety standards. 
Repairs were financed from the airport\'s operating 
revenues.  Work consisted primarily of repairs to the 
communications system and control tower improvements. 
VHF and HF radios were installed for air traffic 
control and communication, and navigational beacons 
were replaced. 
 
AGRICULTURE 
 
SOUTH KIVU SUGAR MILL REOPENS 
 
8. The Kiliba sugar mill in South Kivu province has 
reopened with USD 25,000 in GDRC financial support 
after several years of inactivity.  The mill had closed 
due to regional insecurity and mismanagement of funds. 
Kiliba once employed some 3,500 workers, and will 
reopen with a staff of 147. 
 
PETROLEUM 
 
GASOLINE SHORTAGE IN KISANGANI 
 
9. Local press reports that Kisangani is experiencing a 
severe gasoline shortage due to transportation problems 
on the Congo River.  Low river water levels have 
prevented fuel barges from reaching the city.  Prices 
per liter of gasoline have already moved from FC 400 to 
FC 700, and will likely continue to rise. 
 
AID 
 
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND AIDS DRC AGRICULTURE 
 
10. The African Development Fund will provide USD 36.3 
million to support agricultural reform and expansion in 
the DRC.  USD 26.1 million in loans and 10.2 million in 
grants will be used to repair agricultural access 
routes, rehabilitate market infrastructure, and expand 
institutional capacities.  The Fund will also 
distribute seeds and provide training and rural 
planning assistance.  The aid is intended to ensure a 
stable food supply in the provinces of Bandundu and Bas- 
Congo. 
 
NORWAY FORGIVES USD 700,000 IN DEBT 
 
11. The Norwegian Ambassador and DRC Minister of 
Finance Andre-Phillipe Futa signed an agreement to 
annul some USD 700,000 of the DRC\'s debt to Norway in 
conformity with the DRC\'s HIPC program. 
 
HEALTH 
 
WORLD BANK ENVOY INSPECTS DRC HEALTH SECTOR 
 
12. Eva Jarawan, a World Bank public health specialist 
is in the DRC on a two-week mission to assess the state 
of the country\'s health care infrastructure.  The 
inspection mission is part of the World Bank\'s USD 45 
million Programme Multisectoriel de Rehabilitation et 
Reconstruction (PMURR). 
 
CHOLERA EPIDEMIC IN EASTERN DRC 
 
13. Local press reports that since June 2004, 
approximately 600 cases of cholera have been reported, 
with 56 fatalities, in the Bisiye mining district near 
Walikale, Nord-Kivu province.  Local health 
infrastructure is reportedly strained by the outbreak. 
Additional medical supplies and personnel have been 
requested from Goma.  Local authorities have launched a 
campaign to sensitize the local population to 
preventive hygiene measures.

1. (C) Summary: The International Committee Accompanying the 
Transition (CIAT) and the GDRC strongly condemn the August 13 
attack on the Gatumba refugee camp and call for an 
independent international commission to investigate the 
massacre and bring those responsible to justice. Post 
believes such an investigation is necessary to punish the 
perpetrators and prevent this horrible act from derailing the 
fragile peace process.  End summary. 
 
Conflicting Reports 
-------------------- 
2. (SBU) On August 14, UNHCR reported that at least 156 
Congolese refugees, the vast majority of whom were 
Banyamulenge, including large numbers of women and children, 
were killed the night of August 13. The fatalities are 
expected to increase as there are a number of burn victims in 
local hospitals who are not expected to survive. At the 
August 15 special CIAT meeting, SRSG Swing provided a 
read-out of the initial MONUC report. He said that based on 
preliminary evidence, it appears the attack started at about 
2200 local time, was well-organized and planned and strictly 
targeted at the Banyamulenge section of the camp. (Note: The 
Banyamulenge refugees were separated from Burundian IDPs and 
non-Banyamulenge Congolese refugees at the camp. End note.) 
The method of killing the victims, who were hacked, shot, 
burned, and in some cases had their heads bashed in, was 
consistent with the FNL, who claimed responsibility. 
 
3. (SBU) MONUC Bukavu (which conducted the initial 
investigation) reported conflicting stories from survivors, 
including one Banyamulenge man who said he was visiting 
Burundian IDPs in another section of the camp the night of 
August 13 who warned him not to return to his tent because 
something was about to happen. Another survivor said that 
there were 2 bands of attackers who were speaking a medley of 
languages, including Swahili, Kinyarwanda and Lingala. 
 
4. (C) On August 14, MONUC Bukavu Officer told polcouns that 
contrary to some RCD/G statements, MONUC had not received any 
reports that troops crossed from the DRC into Burundi the 
night of August 13. Likewise, the GDRC did not close the 
DRC/Burundi border on August 13 or 14. He said that there 
were rumors that the attack may have been targeted at men 
loyal to Mutebusi and their families, and that UNHCR staff in 
Bukavu has told him that UNHCR was investigating reports that 
there were arms caches at the camp.

Initial Responses 
----------------- 
 
(Note: Full texts to follow septel. End note.) 
 
CIAT 
---- 
 
5. (U) On August 15, the CIAT met and issued a statement 
condemning this \'abominable act,\' which was designed to 
deliberately sabotage the peace process in the DRC and 
provoke regional instability. It offers condolences to 
families of the victims, to the transition government and the 
Congolese people, and calls on members of the transitional 
government and countries in the region to conduct themselves 
in a responsible manner consistent with existing accords. The 
CIAT hopes that an independent international commission will 
be established to investigate the massacre and bring those 
responsible to justice. 
 
 
President Kabila and the GDRC 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C)  On August 14, President Kabila\'s spokesman issued a 
statement offering condolences to families of the victims, 
strongly condemning the attack, and calling for an 
international commission to investigate the massacre and 
punish those responsible. On August 15, a presidential 
advisor told Ambassador that moderate members of the 
presidency had worked very hard to ensure that this statement 
was issued despite resistance by hardliners. On August 16, 
the MFA will brief Security Council ambassadors (septel). On 
August 14, Pastor Ngoy was arrested in Kinshasa for his 
extreme view on nationality. (Comment: Ngoy, a notorious 
tele-evangelist has incited hatred against Banyamulenge in 
the past. His arrest may have been ordered to send a signal 
that hate speech in the DRC will not be tolerated. End 
comment.) 
 
7. (C) A number of international and national delegations to 
Burundi appear to be in the planning stages. On August 16, 
SRSG reported that MONUC had sent a 3-person delegation to 
Burundi earlier that morning and that he is working with the 
UN High Commission for Human Rights in Geneva who plans to 
send a mission as well. Unfortunately, internal GDRC 
responses thus far have been poorly coordinated. On August 
16, Ministry of Human Rights dircab told poloff that he had 
heard there would be an official delegation sent to Burundi, 
but he did not know if his Ministry would be represented. He 
suggested poloff speak to the Ministry of Interior who he 
thought was leading the delegation. Ministry of Interior 
dircab told poloff that he thought the GDRC might send a 
delegation tomorrow, but had no details about its composition 
or mission. On August 16, MONUC poloff told poloff that MONUC 
was aware that the GDRC wished to send delegations to 
Burundi, but MONUC was very concerned about poor coordination 
between different elements of the GDRC. 
 
VP Ruberwa and the RCD/G 
------------------------ 
 
8. (U) On August 14, VP Ruberwa, who is responsible for 
security issues, made a statement on Radio Okapi condemning 
the massacre, which he qualified as genocide, and claimed 
that the Mai Mai were involved. In an interview recorded on 
August 14 that was broadcast on August 15, Ruberwa called for 
an international investigation and said that the attackers 
were Congolese, Interahamwe and FNL.  On August 15, he 
returned to Gatumba with a number of hard-line Banyamulenge 
leaders, including Benoit Kadage (Note: Ruberwa had also 
visited the camp the day before the attack. End note.). 
 
9. (U) On August 14, RCD/G Secretary General Francis Bedi 
issued a statement accusing two companies of the FARDC from 
Uvira commanded by a Major Ekofo, allegedly Col. Nakabaka\'s 
deputy, of participating in the massacre with the FNL. They 
allege the massacre was planned in Walungu during the course 
of a secret meeting with General Mabe. In addition to calling 
on the national government to condemn this act of genocide 
targeting a well-defined ethnic group, they called for 
investigations of the massacre, the immediate unconditional 
disarming of all genocidal negative forces allied with 
certain Congolese groups, notably the Mai Mai, and 
accelerating the integration of the FARDC. S. Kivu 
Banyamulenge Vice-Governer, Thomas Nzaratimana, spent the 
nights of August 14 and 15 at Gatumba. 
 
Mai Mai 
------- 
 
10. (U) On August 14, a Mai Mai political leader in Kinshasa 
issued a statement saying that the Mai Mai were not 
responsible for the Gatumba massacre, because since July 23 
various S. Kivu Banyamulenge and Mai Mai have been involved 
in a truth and reconciliation mission. On August 14 or 15, a 
spokesman for Col. Nakabaka, a Mai Mai commander based in 
Uvira, condemned the attack on Radio Okapi, said that 
allegations against the Mai Mai were not founded, and 
regretted that Ruberwa and the President of Burundi both 
blamed the Mai Mai. He said that the Mai Mai have never been 
involved in missions outside the DRC, did not cross the 
border into Burundi, and live in peace with the Banyamulenge. 
He opined that if politicians are trying to encourage hate in 
the region to provoke another war, they will be responsible 
for the consequences. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (C) The confusion regarding an official GDRC delegation 
to Gatumba may stem in part from the absence of President 
Kabila, who has gone to Mauritius for the SADC meetings. An 
international investigation to bring the responsible to 
justice is necessary to both punish the perpetrators and 
prevent this horrible act from derailing the fragile peace 
process.

BURUNDI CAMP 
 
1. (U) Summary. The CIAT condemns attack on Congolese 
refugees in Gatumba camp, Burundi, calls for an independent 
international investigation and respect for the peace process 
in the DRC. The President\'s office and Vice-President Ruberwa 
also call for inquiries and punishment of those responsible.

and the Congolese Army. End Summary. 
 
CIAT: Massacre a \"Deliberate Sabotage of Peace Process\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
2. (U) The CIAT issued the following statement on August 15 
regarding the massacre of Congolese refugees at the Gatumba 
Refugee Camp in Burundi (unofficial translation): 
 
The international Committee Accompanying the Transition 
(CIAT) met in urgent session Sunday the 15th of August to 
examine the events which took place the night of  13-14 
August in the Congolese refugee camp of Gatumba in Burundi, 
close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo 
(DRC). The CIAT expresses its outrage regarding the massacre 
in the refugee camp. The CIAT offers its sincere condolences 
to the families of the victims, to the transition government 
and to the Congolese people. 
 
The CIAT condemns in the strongest terms this abominable act 
perpetrated by criminals, whose victims were principally 
Congolese women and children, particularly Banyamulenge. The 
CIAT considers that this barbarous act is designed to 
deliberately sabotage the peace process in the DRC and 
provoke regional instability. 
 
The CIAT pledges anew its resolve to accompany the transition 
process in the DRC through the entire process leading to free 
and transparent elections, under the guidelines established 
by the Constitution and the transition, and which responds to 
the aspirations of the Congolese people for advancing a 
lasting and durable peace in the DRC and the regions. At the 
same time, the CIAT appeals to all members of the transition 
in the DRC, as well as to other countries in the region, to 
conduct themselves in a responsible manner consistent with 
the letter and spirit of the accords entered into to support 
the transition in the DRC and serve as a foundation for 
regional peace. 
 
Finally, the CIAT hopes that an independent international 
commission will be established to bring to light the facts 
about this massacre and bring those responsible to justice. 
 
 
Presidency Demands International Commission of Inquiry 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3. (U) Statement issued by Kadura Kasongo, Spokesman for 
President Kabila, on August 14 (unofficial translation): 
 
News of the attack on a camp of Congolese refugees located at 
the border post of Gatumba in Burundi has just reached us and 
we have learned that over a hundred people have been killed. 
 
The President of the Republic strongly condemns this immoral 
act committed against Congolese civilians and demands 
the formation of an international commission of inquiry to 
shed light on this abominable act, and establish the 
responsibility of those implicated in this act so that they 
may be punished. 
 
The President of the Republic demands that the government of 
Burundi, the international community and the High 
Commissioner for Refugees, provide security and protection to 
the vulnerable population. 
 
The President of the Republic, the Transition Government, and 
the entire Congolese population present their most sincere 
condolences to the families of the victims. 
 
 
Ruberwa: Attackers, Possibly from DRC, Targeted Banyamulenge 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
4. (U) The following are excerpts from Vice-President Azarias 
Ruberwa\'s press conference on August 14 (unofficial 
translation): 
 
What happened that night was a genocide, a carnage committed 
by assailants who surrounded the camp and operated calmly. 
The other camps nearby where other communities lived were not 
targeted only the Banyamulenge camp was attacked...I 
energetically condemn such a cowardly way of pursuing 
refugees even abroad. 
 
The assailants may have come from the Congo, from the Ruzizi 
plain towards Kaliba. According to surviving witnesses, there 
were many attackers and they spoke many languages such as 
Lingala Swahili, Kifulero, Kirundi, Kinyarwanda. It was a 
mixture of Congolese, Interhamwe and FNL (Note: Forces for 
National Liberation, Burundian Hutu rebel group which has 
refused to participate in their country\'s peace process. End 
Note.) 
I am going to Bujumbura to discuss with Burundian authorities 
why assistance was not provided... we need a clear 
explanation for this attack. We need to discuss about burial 
of victims, the future of the camp and the remaining refugees. 
 
What will be the next step against the Congolese community? 
The government must take the necessary  measures to prevent 
this type of genocide and assure everyone\'s security 
otherwise the peace process will be threatened. If there is 
no reconciliation the peace process will fail. 
 
One needs an urgent and well-organized international 
investigation. An investigation done by the Congolese or 
Burundians will always be questioned. I am talking more about 
a genocide than a massacre. It was committed on Burundian 
soil against Congolese probably by attackers belonging to 2 
or 3 nationalities. I spoke to SRSG Swing at three in the 
morning to inform him of what happened, MONUC has been in the 
field since this morning. 
 
Those who planned this genocide had a clear idea of ensuring 
that my mission would fail. They were afraid of its success 
and of reconciliation, because the refugees had started to 
return since yesterday. They were afraid of peaceful 
cohabitation and that the Banyamulenge would come back. 
 
 
Mai Mai: We were not Involved in this Attack 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. The following are excerpts from remarks by spokesperson 
for the Uvira Mai-Mai commander, Colonel Nyakabaka, in 
response to allegations by various people, including 
Burundian President Domitien Ndaizeye, of Mai-Mai 
participation in the massacre (unofficial translation): 
 
...With regards to declarations concerning participation of a 
FARDC branch, namely Mai-Mai in the immoral act committed in 
the refugee camp, we would like to say that these 
declarations are unfounded. We regret that despite the 
declarations made by the crimes\' authors, the Burundian 
President and the DRC Vice-President continue to accuse the 
FARDC for these criminal acts. 
 
We Mai-Mai are for the respect of territorial integrity and 
would never cross the DRC borders to commit an act of 
barbarism outside the country. We live in peace with the 
Banyamulengue and if the politicians seek to foment problems 
to encourage ethnic hatred in the Great Lakes in order to 
provoke further wars, we say to the national and 
international community that these politicians will be 
responsible for their declarations and all that they are 
trying to foment. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (U) Following an August 16 courtesy call on DRC 
Vice-President Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, Ambassador Meece 
reiterated to the press that the US condemns this senseless 
attack on innocent civilians and noted the CIAT statement and 
UNSC Presidential statement of August 15. He reaffirmed US 
support for the transitional government and expressed 
sympathy for the families of the victims and the Congolese 
people in general. 
 
 
7. (U) Despite allegations against Mai Mai, FARDC, 
Interhamwe, and the FNL, at this point it is unclear who 
beyond the FNL bears responsibility for the massacre of 
predominantly Banyamulenge refugees at the Gatumba camp in 
Burundi. An independent international investigation will be 
the most effective and credible way to shed light on the 
facts surrounding this massacre and establishing 
responsibility. In the meantime it is important that rhetoric 
from any of the principal actors in the region not be used to 
provoke nor justify major military actions that could 
reignite widespread conflict in the region. It will be 
important for UNHCR to coordinate the protection of remaining 
Congolese refugees with Burundian authorities to the maximum 
extent possible, and be clearly seen to be so doing. 
Likewise, MONUC needs to maintain active and public 
involvement to investigate and take other steps as 
appropriate to ensure security in the neighboring area of the 
DRC. SRSG Swing is clearly already attuned to this point. 
According to UNHCR-Kinshasa, the official number of camp 
casualties as of August 16, is 150 dead and 108 injured.

1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet 
distribution. 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
2. (U) From August 5-6, Emboffs traveled overland via the 
Matadi Road from Kinshasa to Lukala and Kimpese, Bas-Congo 
province.  Recent rehabilitation of the Matadi Road has 
ameliorated economic hardships in Bas-Congo, but shoddy 
workmanship could lead to a quick deterioration of the 
repairs.  In Lukala, Emboffs met with local government and 
police officials as well as the territorial administrator 
(AT) to discuss local economic conditions, refugee issues, 
and the anticipated national elections. 
 
Economic Profile 
---------------- 
 
2. (U) Officials reported that out of Lukala\'s 25,000 
citizens, some 700 are employed by various companies 
including CILU (Cimentier de Lukala) and SEPCONGO (petroleum 
parastatal).  The rest of the working population is engaged 
in subsistence agriculture, growing mainly manioc, corn, 
beans, and citrus fruits.  The AT expressed hopes of 
developing commercial agriculture in the region, but cited a 
problematic lack of capital.  (Comment.  Insufficient 
protection of property rights and deteriorating 
infrastructure should also be added to the AT\'s list of 
impediments to agricultural organization in Bas-Congo. 
Commercial agriculture once flourished in the DRC, but 
large-scale farmers have refused to return since the pillages 
of 1991 and 1993.  End Comment.) 
 
3. (U) The linchpin of economic activity in Bas-Congo is the 
Matadi Road, National Route No. 1.  It is the primary land 
transportation route between the port of Matadi, Bas-Congo\'s 
agricultural areas, and Kinshasa.  Until several months ago, 
the road was in severe disrepair, but World Bank-funded 
repairs were carried out by a Chinese engineering firm.  The 
road is now passable and commerce has increased 
significantly.  However, road conditions have already begun 
to relapse due to the high volume of truck traffic and lack 
of upkeep.  (Comment.  Repairs seem to have been carried out 
haphazardly.  Cursory Emboff inspection revealed that the 
road was paved in places with only a few inches of asphalt 
and no ballast/riprap.  The coming rainy season will likely 
speed its deterioration.  End Comment.) 
 
Political Climate 
----------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The major political issues facing the Bas-Congo 
community are election preparations and refugee flows. 
Officials expressed a strong desire for elections to be held 
as near as possible to the UN\'s 2005 deadline, but were 
skeptical that elections would occur in a timely manner if at 
all.  Numerous concerns including \"international 
interference\" and stalling by the transitional government 
were raised.  (Comment.  When Emboffs raised questions 
regarding election preparations, local officials admitted 
they were leaving the work up to various NGOs.  End Comment.) 
 
6. (SBU) Refugees continue to be a frustrating factor in 
areas near the DRC-Angola border.  Lukasa officials claimed 
that some 25,000 Angolans refugees had fled into their 
territory over the past decade.  Recently initiated 
repatriation programs have returned some 3,000 refugees to 
Angola, and an unknown number have voluntarily repatriated. 
Officials cited refugee problems as a severe strain on the 
local economy and a source of political tension.  (Note. 
There have been continuous refugee flows between the DRC and 
Angola since the early 1990s as citizens fled their 
respective countries\' conflicts.  According to UNHCR figures, 
approximately 20,000 Angolan refugees remain in Bas-Congo. 
15,000 are in UNHCR camps where they receive food and medical 
assistance.  UNHCR officials feel that these refugees do not 
place a strain on the local economy, as they receive 
international aid and have been allocated separate land to 
cultivate.  UNHCR also opined that any political tension in 
the region was likely due to the expuslion of illegal 
Congolese diamond miners from Angola in late 2003 and early 
2004.  End Note.) 
 
7. (SBU) Bas-Congo sentiments towards the international 
community\'s presence in the DRC ranged from mild skepticism 
to utter disdain.  More than one official expressed contempt 
for the election process, stating that \"the international 
community would hijack the elections to install a cooperative 
leader, just as it did in Rwanda.\"  Another official availed 
Emboffs of America\'s responsibility to rebuild the DRC, 
considering the fact that the USG had \"taken advantage of the 
country.\"  (Comment.  Information flows outside of the major 
cities in the DRC continue to be unreliable, despite the 
prevalence of cellphones.  Public opinion tends to be 
polarized due to the lack of a credible news source and a 
victim mentality that has developed over a century of 
colonization and dictatorship.  End Comment.)

SUBJECT: OFDA REP VISIT TO SOUTHERN EQUATEUR 
 
 
----- 
Summary 
----- 
1. (U) From June 29 to July 3, OFDA Rep Victor 
Bushamuka traveled in southern Equateur Province to 
evaluate the humanitarian situation and monitor 
progress in the USAID/OFDA-funded food security project 
implemented by Action Against Hunger (AAH-USA).  Though 
fighting in the area ended over two years ago, only an 
estimated 60 percent of the pre-war area\'s population 
have returned to their villages, due to military 
harassment and a lack of humanitarian assistance. Most 
IDPs returning in Bolomba in July were barely clothed 
and in poor health, but only a few were manifestly 
malnourished.  In its food security project, AAH-USA 
distributed seeds, agricultural tools, and fishing 
equipment to an estimated 45,000 IDPs and returnees. 
Food security programs, health assistance, and non-food 
items will continue to be needed at least for another 
year, given the slow return rate.  The priority target 
area should be the newly accessible villages in the ex- 
MLC-controlled territories.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
2. (U) OFDA Rep Victor Bushamuka visited Equateur 
Province from June 29 to July 03, 2004. The objective 
of the visit was to assess the prevailing humanitarian 
situation in southern Equateur and the success of the 
USAID/OFDA-funded food security program implemented by 
AAH-USA. During the visit, OFDA Rep met with groups of 
beneficiaries, new returnees, civil and military 
authorities, and staff of INGOs AAH-USA and Medecins 
Sans Frontieres / Belgium (MSF-B). 
 
3. (U) Equateur is one of the poorest provinces of DRC. 
The southern territories of Equateur sustained heavy 
fighting between armed forces of the ex-government 
(FAC) and ex-rebel forces of MLC from 1998 to 2001. 
During the war, the territories of Bolomba, Befale, 
Boende, Basankusu, Bokungu, and Ikela were all divided 
in half by the front line with MLC forces controlling 
the northern parts and the FAC ruling the southern 
areas. Military confrontations in these territories led 
to massive displacements estimated between 110,000 to 
170,000 people by UN-OCHA. Most IDPs took refuge in the 
forest and it is believed that a large number still 
remain there. 
 
---------- 
Non-return of many forest IDPs 
---------- 
4. (U) The Administrator and the INGO staff in Bolomba 
estimated the current population to be about 60 percent 
of the pre-war population. In Bolomba, the OFDA Rep 
visited both the ex-MLC and ex-FAC controlled villages 
and found that more people have returned in the ex-FAC 
areas than in the ex-MLC territories. As of June, the 
population of the ex-MLC controlled villages including 
Bosanjoa, Bosolikubu, Boko, and Bosekombo was estimated 
by local residents at still less than 20 percent of pre- 
war figures. 
 
5. (U)  The non-return of so many IDPs who fled to the 
forest in Equateur is surprising considering that there 
has been no significant fighting in these areas for 
more than 2 years and considering that they are in 
relatively poor health with high prevalences of 
malnutrition and of skin infections.  It has been 
common belief among many in the humanitarian community 
that shame at having little clothing has been the main 
reason for these people\'s reluctance to return to their 
villages. 
 
6. (U) OFDA Rep\'s own discussions with various groups 
of IDPs suggest that many who fled to the forest remain 
there for reasons other than lack of clothes.  For one 
thing, it is not clear that those who have returned are 
any better off than those who remain in the forest.  It 
was noted that military forces, particularly in the 
former MLC areas, still occupy villages and harass the 
populations who return.  Some of these soldiers are 
indeed the same that committed numerous atrocities 
during the war.  Furthermore, there is as yet little 
humanitarian assistance provided in the villages and 
many IDPs have now planted crops in their refuge areas. 
There is, thus, at present little incentive to return. 
Although the problems of a lack of clothes and of poor 
physical appearance were also cited by IDPs, these did 
not appear to be critical with regard to the question 
of whether or not to leave the forest and return to 
former villages. 
 
7. (U) For IDPs who had returned, the opportunity to 
benefit from AAH\'s OFDA-funded food security assistance 
program was cited as a key incentive.  Other reasons 
given were accessibility to health care and education. 
 
-------- 
Conditions of New Returnees 
-------- 
8. (U) Although INGOs and others are reporting high 
rates of malnutrition throughout southern Equateur, 
OFDA Rep observed few obvious cases during his visit. 
The physical appearance of returnees did, however, 
suggest precarious health conditions, with many 
children seeming to be in need of medical attention. As 
has been reported, most of the new returnees were 
barely clothed with some adults wearing only rags. 
 
------------ 
Humanitarian Assistance 
------------ 
9. (U) Only two international humanitarian institutions 
-- AAH-USA and MSF-B -- are currently active in 
southern Equateur. AAH-USA assists returnees through 
the OFDA food security project.  MSF-B provides basic 
health care services, and measles vaccinations, as well 
as sleeping sickness screening and treatment.  For 
security reasons, both AAH-USA and MSF-B activities in 
southern Equateur have been largely concentrated in the 
ex-government controlled areas, including Bolomba, 
Lolanga-Mampoko, Boende, Befale and Mondombe. The ex- 
MLC could not trust AAH-USA and MSF-B because they had 
their main offices in Mbandaka, which was at the time 
an enemy territory. As a result, AAH-USA and MSF-B 
could not be granted permission by ex-MLC to operate in 
its territories. In addition, AAH-USA and MSF-B staff 
had been physically threatened each time they tried to 
visit ex-MLC territories. 
 
----- 
OFDA Food Security Activities 
----- 
10. (U) A one-year grant was awarded by USAID/OFDA to 
AAH to improve food security for IDPs, returnees and 
vulnerable populations and to promote the re- 
establishment of pre-war level of livelihood activities 
in southern Equateur. This project covers a strip of 
territories extending eastward from Bolomba, Lolanga- 
Mampoko, Boende, and Mondombe.  Project activities have 
included the distribution of maize seeds, cassava 
cuttings, hoes, machetes, and axes to 3,000 
agricultural families in Boende and Mondombe, as well 
as the provision of fishing equipment, including 125 
canoes, 4,544 fishing nets, 68,838 hooks, 350 nylon 
threads, and 250 machetes, to 5,000 beneficiary 
households.  According to AAH-USA, the fishing capacity 
of the beneficiaries of the OFDA food security project 
increased from 15kg per week prior to the project to an 
average of about 71 kg per week.  In 2003, AAH-USA 
reached a total of 9,000 households, which can be 
estimated at 45,000 people. 
 
11. (U) AAH-USA has been charging a small fee to the 
beneficiaries of seeds, tools and fishing equipment to 
fund the activities of selected community based 
humanitarian and development organizations (CBO). CBO 
activities that were funded by AAH-USA in 2003 include 
schools and roads rehabilitation, transportation of 
sick community members to hospitals, and community seed 
production. 
 
------------ 
Implementation Challenges 
------------ 
12. (U) The project territories, especially Boende and 
Mondombe experienced a major drought at the beginning 
of the 2003 agricultural season, shortly after the 
distribution of seeds and tools to the beneficiaries. 
As a result, most farmers delayed their planting, which 
resulted in poor harvest or complete crop failure in 
2003. 
 
13. (U) Frequent harassment of the population by the 
military also greatly affected the activities of AAH- 
USA in Equateur. In 2003, convinced that production 
must have increased as a result of AAH\'s activities, 
soldiers made increased demands on populations in all 
of the AAH-USA implementing areas, especially in 
Boende, Mondombe and Lolanga. 
 
----------------- 
Observations and Recommendations 
----------------- 
14. (U) Equateur is one of the poorest provinces of the 
DRC.  The capacity of most IDPs to re-establish 
livelihood activities, and of residents to assist 
returning IDPs, is limited, making it likely that the 
majority of IDPs still in the forest will require 
assistance upon their return. Food security and health 
care programs will thus still be needed in southern 
Equateur for at least another year.  To reduce the 
strain caused by new returnees on the limited resources 
of local population, a distribution of non-food items 
to new returnees appears essential. 
 
15. (U) New assistance efforts should be focused mainly 
in areas that have not yet been assisted, which are 
largely those in the former MLC territory.  In ex- 
government areas, most of which have already 
experienced some assistance, only new returnees should 
be targeted. MEECE.

SUBJECT: OFDA-FUNDED FOOD SECURITY ACTIVITIES IN THE 
RUZIZI PLAIN AND MIDDLE PLATEAU 
 
 
1.  (U) During a recent visit to the Uvira area, OFDA 
Rep Victor Bushamuka viewed USAID/OFDA-funded food 
security activities implemented by Action Against 
Hunger (AAH-USA) in various parts of the Ruzizi plain. 
As part of a larger project, AAH restored irrigation 
canals in the Ruzizi plain and rehabilitated fish ponds 
in the middle plateau of Uvira.  Although the OFDA 
project has significantly contributed to the 
improvement of food security of IDPs and returnees of 
Uvira and Fizi, food security programs will continue to 
be needed for at least another year. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) During a recent visit to the Uvira area, OFDA 
Rep Victor Bushamuka had the opportunity to evaluate 
the efforts by Action Against Hunger (AAH-USA) to 
improve food security in various sections of the Ruzizi 
plain -- a large, low flat stretch of land extending 
northward from the upper border of Lake Tanganyika 
along the Ruzizi River.  The area has been highly 
volatile in terms of security since 1996, with repeated 
clashes between armed groups often result in massive 
movements of the population within and outside the area 
and sometimes into Burundi (as was most recently the 
case when the insurgency of Col. Jules Mutebusi 
temporarily held the town of Kamanyola for a few days 
in June, causing over 20,000 Congolese to flee across 
the border). 
 
3.  (U) AAH-USA\'s agricultural activities in the Ruzizi 
Plain are part of a larger project funded by USAID/OFDA 
to improve food security and to facilitate the re- 
establishment of livelihood-sustaining activities for 
IDPs, returnees, and other vulnerable populations in 
both Uvira and Fizi territories.  During the 2003-2004 
main agricultural season, AAH-USA distributed 64 metric 
tones of food crop seeds including maize, bean, and 
peanut, and 570 kg of vegetable seeds to 15,400 
households, representing about 77,000 people. 
Agricultural tools distributed included 16,400 hoes and 
11,400 watering cans. Approximately 500 beneficiaries 
in 25 fishing villages along the west shore of Lake 
Tanganyika also benefited from a distribution of boats 
and fishing nets. AAH-USA estimates that it has already 
directly assisted over 85,000 returnees, IDPs and other 
vulnerable populations in the two territories. 
 
4.  (U) In addition to distributing basic agricultural 
inputs, AAH has also helped to rehabilitate dams and 
irrigation canals in 6 villages in the Ruzizi Plain and 
3 villages along the west shore of Lake Tanganyika as 
part of its efforts to promote the re-establishment of 
income generating activities.  An association of rice 
producers also received a rice grinder as part of the 
project, and both on the plain and in the \"Middle 
Plateau\" area just above it to the west, AAH has helped 
rehabilitate 258 fish ponds for fish farmers. 
 
5. (U) Frequent clashes between various military and 
various armed groups, including Mai-Mai and 
Interahamwe, have prevented AAH from covering all the 
areas as it had originally intended. Ndolera and 
Lubarika could not be reached in 2003, becoming 
accessible only in February 2004. Clashes between 
Interahamwe and military on the Middle Plateau near 
Lemera led to a temporary suspension of AAH activities 
in that area in March. 
 
6.  (U) In the 2004/2005 season, AAH plans to extend 
its distribution activities to newly accessible areas, 
including the Ndolera and Lubarika of the Middle 
Plateau and villages on the Ubwari peninsula south of 
Uvira.  Additional maize/cassava mills are planned in 
2004-2005 for Baraka, Fizi center, Lemera and Ndolera, 
and a rice grinder in Nundu. The irrigation 
rehabilitation program will be extended to such Middle- 
Plateau villages as Kigombo, Rubanga and Kiringye. 
 
7.  (U) To reduce the continuing relatively high rate 
of malnutrition in the area, AAH intends to work 
through local NGOs to promote the production and 
consumption of soybean throughout Uvira and Fizi 
Territories. In this initiative, seeds will be produced 
by selected local NGOs after they have received 
training in seed multiplication, soybean production and 
transformation procedures. Seeds produced by these NGOs 
will be either distributed to new returnees and IDPs or 
sold at a reduced price to interested residents in the 
2004-2005 planting season. AAH has had success with 
soybean promotion in other areas of the project.  OFDA 
Rep saw a number of flourishing soybean fields in 
villages along the axis Makobola-Baraka, south of 
Uvira.

Observations 
----- 
 
8.  (U) Although the OFDA project has significantly 
contributed to the improvement of food security of IDPs 
and returnees in the territories of Uvira and Fizi, 
food security programs will continue to be needed for 
at least another year since the area is one of the last 
in eastern DRC to benefit from the peace brought to 
much of the country by the installation of the 
transitional government in June of 2003 and since much 
of the area\'s population has yet to return. MEECE.

SUBJECT: OPPOSITION FIGURE TSHISEKEDI AND THE SUCCESSION 
QUESTION 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  A top official in opposition figure Etienne 
Tshisekedi\'s political party, the UDPS, said some of 
 
SIPDIS 
Tshisekedi\'s lieutenants are working to succeed him as party 
 
SIPDIS 
leader.  The idea of \"inheriting\" the party is optimistic, 
since it is identified so closely with Tshisekedi and would 
likely shrink to a shadow of its former self if he dies or 
retires.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
A Brewing Succession Fight? 
--------------------------- 
2. (C) \"Union pour la Democratie et le Progres Social\" 
Secretary-General Remy Masama-ma-Kiese told poloff 12 August 
 
SIPDIS 
some party cadres including he himself are trying to position 
themselves to succeed UDPS leader Etienne Tshisekedi.  (Note: 
 Tshisekedi is over seventy, and is reportedly not in the 
best of health.  He rarely makes public appearances.  End 
Note.)  Masamba intends to organize a party congress in 
December 2004 or January 2005, which, if successful and 
well-managed, will boost his chances at succeeding 
Tshisekedi.  At present, he is desperately looking for money 
 
SIPDIS 
to pay for the congress. 
 
3. (C) Masamba, who is from Bas-Congo rather than the Kasais 
like Tshisekedi, said the UDPS risked being accused of 
tribalism if Tshisekedi\'s successor is also a Kasaian, 
therefore he sees his non-Kasaian identity as a plus. 
Nonetheless, one of Masamba\'s main competitors for the job is 
Mr. Alexis Mutanda, director/editor of the newspaper \"La 
Tempete des Tropiques\" and the party\'s national secretary for 
relations with UDPS federations abroad.  Mutanda, a Kasaian, 
is in turn backed by Jonas Mukamba, a party elder and wealthy 
financier.  Masamba said the only one of Tshisekedi\'s sons 
who is politically active is Felix Tshisekedi, president of 
the UDPS federation in Belgium, but he apparently is not 
interested in succeeding his father. 
 
4. (C) As for Tshisekedi himself, Masamba said he is hoping 
to receive an invitation to travel to the U.S. to attend the 
Republican Party convention in September.  (Note:  Tshisekedi 
recently participated in a National Democratic Institute 
conference in the U.S. that coincided with the Democratic 
Party convention.  Virtually all local media reported that he 
traveled to attend the latter.  End Note.)  Long-term, 
Masamba speculated that the party leader could be persuaded 
or encouraged to become the Congo\'s \"Mandela,\" a respected 
individual who does not hold public office but could 
nonetheless help bring peace throughout the region. 
(Comment:  This would be a stretch.  Tshisekedi has name 
recognition and some loyal supporters, but is seen as far too 
partisan and proud to ever be accepted as a neutral public 
figure.  Nor is it likely that Tshisekedi would ever 
willingly give up his long quest for national leadership. End 
Comment.) 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) The idea of \"inheriting\" the UDPS from Tshisekedi is 
optimistic, since the party is identified so closely with 
him.  If Tshisekedi were to retire or die, the party would 
likely shrink to a shadow of its former self.  Any 
non-Kasaian would have difficulty in maintaining the 
allegiance of the party\'s core Kasaian supporters.  END

SUBJECT: VP BEMBA FLYING HIGH ON TRAVEL TO U.S. 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.5 b/d 
 
1. (C) Summary. On Aug 12, Amb Meece paid an introductory 
courtesy call on Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba during 
which Bemba reiterated his desire to meet with U.S. officials 
during travel to the U.S. in October. Bemba has previously 
made a strong push for an invitation for official travel to 
the U.S. He has now taken the track of requesting meetings 
while already in the U.S. for other reasons, in this case the 
annual World Bank/IMF meetings. Ambassador diplomatically 
pushed back on the travel issue citing potential conflicts as 
well as security concerns during the upcoming IFI meetings in 
Washington. End Summary. 
 
2. (C) VP Bemba has relaunched his campaign to meet with 
high-level USG officials during travel to the U.S. He has 
previously strongly requested an invitation for an official 
visit to hold meetings with cabinet level officials (e.g. 
Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, etc). Not 
 
SIPDIS 
having received such an invitation, he is now proposing that 
Post assist in arranging meetings with USG officials while he 
is in Washington for the World Bank/IMF conferences in early 
October. 
 
3. (C) Bemba transitioned into this part of the discussion 
with Ambassador Meece after citing the economic progress the 
DRC has made, especially since his taking office. He planted 
the idea as an opportunity to meet with potential investors. 
Bemba reiterated that the USG has never invited him to the 
U.S., and that he would like to meet with U.S. officials. 
 
4. (C) Ambassador countered by mentioning several major 
distractions for Washington officials which would potentially 
limit their availability in the next two months, including 
the upcoming UNGA session on Sept 22. (Comment. It is 
unlikely that Bemba will be permitted by President Kabila to 
attend the UNGA, even if he so desired, as Foreign Minister 
Ramazani is of the MLC and closely tied to Bemba. End 
Comment.) Ambassador also cautioned Bemba that September and 
October falls during the tail end of the political season in 
the U.S., and many government officials, especially 
Congressmen, will not be in Washington. Bemba grudgingly 
acknowledged that the trip might be a problem, but 
nevertheless continued to push for USG support for high-level 
meetings and possible other programming. 
 
5. (C) Ambassador also noted the recent security warning for 
the IFI conferences. He emphasized that security will be 
tight and movement in downtown Washington will be restricted, 
adding another hindrance to meeting facilitation. Bemba 
seemed to take the comment rather seriously and asked 
worriedly if this will be a serious problem for travel. 
Ambassador assured Bemba that we have no recent specific 
threat information and that he will inform Bemba if there is 
reason for concern. 
 
6. (C) Comment. We do not recommend an official visit to DC 
for Bemba, whose motives are in large part, personal. 
President Kabila has already met with senior USG officials 
and for Bemba this is a sore spot personally and politically. 
As head of the MLC, Bemba could potentially face serious 
human rights abuse allegations by the International Criminal 
Court. This makes it even less desirable to help arrange 
high-profile cabinet level meetings for him. End Comment.

SUBJECT: PRIDE AND PREJUDICE BY VP BEMBA 
 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.5 b/d 
 
1. (C) Summary. On Aug 12, Ambassador Meece paid a courtesy 
call on DRC Vice President for Economic and Financial 
Affairs, Jean-Pierre Bemba. Bemba made clear his pride in the 
economic achievements of the past year and his extreme 
prejudice toward Rwandan President Kagame as the primary 
culprit behind the Kivus insecurity. The two also discussed 
potential investments, OPIC and HIPC, elections planning, 
regional confidence building and Bemba\'s interest in making 
an offical visit to Washington (septel). End Summary. 
 
ECONOMIC CREDENTIALS AND INVESTMENT 
 
2. (C) Ambassador Meece opened by commending the economic 
progress the DRC has made over the past two years, 
specifically citing the impressive IMF report in Washington. 
Bemba accepted credit for the DRC\'s macro progress citing 
forecasts for CY2004 of inflation at 5 percent and GDP growth 
of 6 percent. He also made a point to note that the exchange 
rate has remained stable and that the GDRC is operating on a 
balanced budget. Increased trade (traffic at Matadi has 
doubled and exports have increased 26 percent) and general 
commerce was also of importance as Bemba claims that economic 
activity has increased twofold in the past six months. 
However, he offered the caveat that the common Congolese are 
increasing purchases of staple goods, for example bread, 
demonstrating increasing purchasing power. (Comment. To his 
credit, this shows that Bemba is looking at the local 
population rather than just the big services, industries and 
import-export firms. End Comment.) 
 
3. (C) Bemba highlighted three main economic challenges: 
bringing the informal sector into the formal economy, 
improving the tax ethic, and deepening the fight against 
corruption and fraud - particularly in the Eastern DRC. 
Ambassador agreed with Bemba\'s estimate and expressed U.S. 
support for reinforcing reforms and improving the private 
sector through foreign direct investment. Bemba took this 
opportunity to raise his desire to travel to the U.S. to meet 
with potential investors and USG officials (septel). 
Ambassador noted that the Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation (OPIC) is currently considering enlarging its 
program in the DRC, which will help potential investors 
explore opportunities and manage risk in the DRC. (Comment. 
Bemba appeared not to have any knowledge of OPIC or its role 
in investment promotion, but quickly recognized the potential 
benefits to actively working with the USG in supporting 
OPIC\'s program. End Comment.) 
 
4. (C) Ambassador also brought up the case of Phelps-Dodge, 
which is currently in negotiations with Gecamines for a 
several hundred million dollar investment project, as a test 
case for large-scale investment in the DRC. Bemba assured the 
Ambassador that his people are trying to finalize the 
dossier. He stated that the Phelps-Dodge file in now securely 
in the hands of the Minister of Plan Alexis Thambwe (MLC 
affiliated) and that the legal questions will now be resolved 
since the lead lawyer has returned from foreign travel. 
(Comment. Bemba appeared poorly informed on the details of 
the case, even though his economic advisor Yves Kisombe and 
Minister Thambwe are both directly involved in evaluating the 
file. Phelps-Dodge and Gecamines reps have told Econoff that 
the legal issue was resolved on July 29. The question is now 
the financial aspects of the joint-venture, particularly 
Gecamines\' equity stake. End Comment.) 
 
5. (C) Ambassador assured Bemba that the Department is 
working closely with Congress to secure funding for HIPC debt 
relief based on U.S. obligations to the Paris Club. Bemba 
commented that the deadline for the HIPC completion point was 
2006 and he would like to reach completion before then. The 
DRC arrived at a decision point in July 2003 and continues to 
pay its debts to the U.S. in a timely manner despite its 
fiscal difficulties. He hopes that Congress will take that 
into consideration when deciding on appropriations. (Comment. 
Post believes that he intended to both demonstrate the good 
progress made by the DRC as well as maintain pressure on the 
USG to fulfill its Paris Club obligations. End Comment.) 
Ambassador reassured Bemba that for the coming fiscal year, 
top level officials in the government are working hard to 
convince Congress to appropriate the necessary funds for HIPC 
debt relief. 
 
A POLITICAL TOUR D\'HORIZON 
 
6. (C) Bemba focused on two issues: elections/integration and 
Rwanda. Both Bemba and Ambassador commented that the 
integration of the military and the DDR(RR) programs must 
accelerate before elections can occur. Ambassador assured 
Bemba that DDR(RR) is a high priority issue in Washington and 
that he will take up the issue with SRSG Swing as well as the 
World Bank and IMF resident representatives to make sure 
there is enough institutional support and financing. Bemba 
clearly believed that unless the intergration issues were 
resolved, elections would not occur in a serene and secure 
environment. 
 
7. (C) However, Bemba stated that he was not convinced that 
all actors (i.e. some in the Eastern DRC) wanted the DRC to 
arrive at free and transparent elections. He opined that 
Rwanda was obviously at fault for the continuing instability 
in the Kivus. He stated that the Congolese people hold no 
prejudices against the Rwandan people; however, Kagame must 
halt his actions because the Congolese people do not deserve 
to be mistreated by Kigali. Ambassador reiterated that the 
U.S. position in support of Congolese sovereignty and 
territorial integrity. Bemba said that he believes that the 
U.S. needs to play the principle role in confidence building 
between the Great Lakes states. He is looking for U.S. moral 
if not material support to organize the CPGL and the Great 
Lakes Conference as well as for follow through on the 
tripartite border verification mechanism. He fears that the 
U.S. and the international community have forgotten the DRC 
in the rush to deal with the Darfur crisis. Ambassador 
reassured Bemba that the U.S. has not forgotten the DRC and 
was working to arrange not only the next tripartite meeting 
but also supports efforts to have effective mechanisms to 
secure Congo\'s borders. Bemba was keen on Monuc having a 
central role in the proposed Joint Verification Mechanism 
(JVM). However, he was cool on AU participation beyond 
observer status. 
 
COMMENT 
 
8. (C) Bemba was engaged and said most of the right things 
during the one hour conversation. He appears to have a good 
handle on the macro aspects of the economic and financial 
portfolio. However, his knowledge of ongoing investment cases 
and investment incentives seems somewhat lacking considering 
the stress he laid on improving the formal sector. Bemba\'s 
political commentary reflected his susceptibility to feeling 
stilted and ignored. He stated that he would like to see the 
U.S. take a more activist role in the Congolese peace process 
and is afraid that Darfur is distracting the U.S. and the 
rest of the international community. His commentary on Kagame 
and the situation in the East was typical and expected. 
Noticably absent was any mention of Ugandan involvement in 
the arms or the minerals trade in the Kivus and Ituri. End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: GDRC URGES UNSC ACTION IN RESPONSE TO GATUMBA CAMP 
ATTACK 
 
1. (U) Summary:  In the absence of other senior officials, 
the International Cooperation Vice Minister, an RCD-Goma 
appointee, convoked UNSC Perm 5 heads of mission August 16 to 
urge support for an international investigation, a more 
vigorous MONUC disarmament mandate, and aid to attack 
victims.  He also requested all efforts be made with 
\"neighboring countries\" to encourage security cooperation in 
the area.  Answering a question, the Vice Minister said that 
the GDRC was willing to meet with Burundian and Rwandan 
representatives before the end of the month, but declined to 
affirm whether he expected such a meeting to occur.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (C)  In the absence of President Kabila, the Foreign 
Minister, and many other senior officials attending the SADC 
summit in Mauritius, Vice Minister of International 
Cooperation Christian Kambinga Sale convoked heads of mission 
of the UNSC Perm 5 countries to the Foreign Ministry the 
afternoon of August 16.  (Comment:  Kambinga, a Katangan 
member of the RCD-G, was once responsible for that party\'s 
contacts with the diplomatic community.  Although 
occasionally espousing an RCD-G hardline, in general we have 
found him to be moderate and reasonable.  End comment.) 
 
3.  (U) The Vice Minister reiterated GDRC reaction to the 
brutal August 14 attack on Congolese refugees at the Gatumba 
camp in Burundi, referring to prior statements issued by the 
Presidency.  He criticized UNHCR for having located the camp 
adjacent to a Burundi military base.  In his presentation, he 
appealed for support from the UNSC permanent members in the 
several areas.  Specifically: 
 
a) To push for a rapid and thorough independent international 
investigation of the attack.  The Vice Minister said that 
only such an independent international investigation would be 
credible.  He added that the GDRC did want to point fingers 
yet regarding allegations of involvement, but said that all 
avenues needed to be explored.  (Comment: A reference to 
widespread charges of involvement by Mai Mai or other 
Congolese groups, and Rwandan Hutu extremists in addition to 
the Burundian FNL.  End comment). 
 
b) To support calls for an expanded and more aggressive MONUC 
mandate relative to disarmament.  By expanding, the Vice 
Minister made it clear he was referring to authorization for 
disarmament by force of \"negative elements,\" a term long used 
to refer to Hutu extremist elements in the region and their 
supporters. 
 
c) To encourage neighboring countries to maintain contact 
with the GDRC and cooperate fully regarding the international 
investigation and generally help to address general 
insecurity in the region.  In his remarks, the Vice Minister 
particularly noted USG and Belgian efforts to-date to promote 
regional dialogue. 
 
d) To favorably consider the need for additional aid to 
victims of the attack.  The Vice Minister acknowledged 
activity by UNHCR and NGO,s, but observed that the brutality 
of the attack and the number of family victims greatly 
increased the impact on a large number of people in the 
camps, and likely relatives in the DRC as well, creating 
additional burdens that the UNHCR and others may be hard 
pressed to meet. 
 
4. (C) The Vice Minister reported that a significant GDRC 
delegation, including a number of parliamentarians, had 
traveled to Bujumbura to be present for funeral ceremonies, 
talk with Burundian authorities and most importantly with the 
surviving refugees themselves.  He affirmed that the GDRC 
continues to wish for the refugees to return home as soon as 
possible.  (Comment:  MONUC reports that, in addition to VP 
Ruberwa, the GDRC was represented in Gatumba by Minister of 
Interior Mbemba and several Parliamentarians.  Also present, 
perhaps unfortunately, were \"the group of eight,\" i.e., the 
disaffected RCD-G parliamentarians headed by Bizima Karaha, 
and Banyamulenge community extremists including Kadage, who 
MONUC believes to be responsible for the widespread 
recruitment (sometimes by force) of Banyamulenge youth from 
the Cyangagu refugee camp for a \"Banyamulenge Defense Force.\" 
 End Comment) 
 
5. (U) The Ambassador and the other Perm 5 mission heads 
reiterated condemnation of the Gatumba attack and other 
elements of the August 15 International Committee to 
Accampany the Transition (CIAT) communique and UNSC 
Presidential statement.  The Ambassador noted a further USG 
statement would likely be issued on Monday as well in 
Washington. 
 
6. (U) Near the end of the meeting, the French Charge asked 
the Vice Minister about reports of a possible meeting of 
GDRC, Burundian, and Rwandan officials toward the end of the 
month.  Hesitating slightly, the Minister stated that the 
GDRC certainly was willing to participate in such a meeting, 
but he declined to elaborate further, nor confirm that he 
expected any such meeting to occur. 
 
7. (C) Comment:  Although Kambinga\'s presentation was 
moderate and reasonable, general reaction to the tragedy 
appears to be becoming increasingly extreme.  There are 
mounting reports of RCD members purchasing one-way tickets 
for themselves and their families to return to eastern Congo, 
as mumblings that the Tutsis organized the massacre 
themselves to generate international sympathy multiply.  Even 
moderate members of the Banyamulenge community, normally not 
given to exaggeration, are anxiously discussing the 
possibility of a reprise of the 1996 anti-Tutsi bloodbath in 
Kinshasa and elsewhere.  To a certain extent, these 
sentiments reflect old, underlying tensions, particularly 
among the RCD, many of whom have reportedly felt insecure in 
Kinshasa.  The events in Gatumbe may have temporarily 
intensified these predispostions, but we believe that if the 
massacre investigation is handled promptly and thoroughly, 
these concerns can be dispelled.

following the weekend attack on the Gatumba refugee camp in

in itself provoke a complete change in transition dynamics, 
it has significantly heightened tensions and exacerbated 
divisions and fears already present.  A decision by Vice 
President Ruberwa to withdraw from the transition government, 
a similar RCD-Goma institutional move, or a military 
miscalculation or &accident8 in the east could have major 
negative consequences for what is at best a volatile 
situation in the region. 
 
2. (C) There are at least three major Congolese military 
forces operating right now in the east.  Rebel General 
Nkunda,s forces, the militia controlled by North Kivu 
Governor Serufuli, and FARDC forces.  The latter are composed 
of various factions, and include at least some units of 
questionable loyalty.  Likewise it is unclear when and under 
what circumstances Serufuli might seek to use his militia, or 
to what purpose.   There are probably also scattered 
Congolese Mai Mai forces of varying interests, capability, 
and loyalty depending on the individual group, and Rwandan 
Hutu extremists (e.g., FDLR, Interahamwe) in the area, 
although it is difficult to impossible to obtain an accurate 
estimate of the size or capabilities of these groups.  It is 
unlikely that anyone holds a decisive military advantage 
right now.  The introduction of any foreign forces from 
Burundi, Rwanda, or elsewhere, of course would significantly 
alter the equation.  The latter would also have major 
negative political effects in Kinshasa. 
 
Political Moves 
------------------ 
 
3. (C) On the political front, President Kabila apparently 
decided to participate in meeting(s) in Dar es Salaam 
following the SADC Mauritius summit, a useful act that should 
at minimum help to open communications with Burundi 
officials.  We have also received reports from various 
sources that President Mbeki has been active, among other 
things to encourage Vice President Ruberwa to remain in the 
transition government.  We assume that he is also seeking to 
defuse explosive feelings in Kigali and Bujumbura, as well as 
in his contacts with Kabila. 
 
4. (C) SRSG Swing was able to speak with Ruberwa August 17 to 
encourage him to remain engaged.  Swing indicated that 
Ruberwa still seems to be considering his options.  (Comment: 
 Ruberwa is likely motivated by personal fears as well as 
political calculations.  End Comment.) 
 
What We Can Do 
--------------------- 
 
5. (C) There are two major problems that we believe need to 
be addressed.  One related to the political process in the 
DRC; the other potential military mistakes that could lead to 
wider conflicts in eastern Congo. 
 
6.  (C) Regarding the domestic Congolese poltical aspect, the 
Ambassador has been trying to reach Ruberwa August 18 to 
convey a similar message to that of SRSG Swing.  Ruberwa is 
currently in Goma with other RCD leaders, and phones are not 
being answered.  While unsuccessful thus far, the Ambassador 
will continue to try to get through.  We are also requesting 
a one on one meeting of the Ambassador with President Kabila 
on the latter,s return to Kinshasa to discuss the issue, 
encourage negotiation to maintain the integrity of the 
fundamental transition process, and avoid unhelpful military 
actions. 
 
6. (C) The communique issued by the Department in Washington 
on Monday, August 17, was very useful, and the re-issued 
communique distributed by the Mission in Kinshasa has sought 
to disseminate the text as widely as possible.  (It was read 
verbatim on 8 major radio channels, and appears in 7 of the 
leading newspapers.)  We believe in all public and private 
statements in Washington and the region, it is useful to 
reiterate the basic themes of that communique, i.e. 
condemnation of the attack, the need for a full 
investigation, and the need for cooperation among government 
in the region to maintain peace and security. 
 
7.  (C) The planned trilateral meeting in Kampala next week 
will provide a potentially very useful forum to try to 
stimulate dialogue between Kinshasa, Kigali, and Kampala.  In 
the interim, we believe it would be useful to encourage 
strongly governments in all regional capitals to avoid 
inflammatory rhetoric, much less provocative military moves 
or actions, that could set off wider conflicts in the 
uncertain military environment of the east.  Calls from a 
senior Department official to appropriate officials could 
help underscore the seriousness with which we view the 
current situation. 
 
8. (C) Finally, pending the actions described above, we 
believe it would be useful for Embassies in relevant 
capitals, including Pretoria, London, Paris, and Belgium, to 
consult with host country to share information and encourage 
coordinated action.

SUBJECT: CONGO-KINSHASA AGOA ELIGIBILITY REVIEW 2004 
 
REF: STATE 168472 
 
1. This cable responds to reftel request for an AGOA 
eligibility review and update of the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC). 
 
2. Summary. Since October 2003, the DRC has made progress in 
almost all areas listed in reftel. The DRC has maintained 
sound fiscal and monetary policies leading to broad praise 
from the IMF and World Bank and continued economic growth. 
As the DRC continues its transitional period from war to 
peace, the trade preferences granted by AGOA support the 
development of the formal economy, easing the reintegration 
of former combatants. Given that the DRC was mired in an 
openly declared civil war until July 2003, the progress made 
in one year is significant. End Summary. 
 
MARKET BASED ECONOMY 
 
3. The DRC is currently working with the World Bank to 
develop and implement a private sector development plan. 
This will involve the eventual privatization of many defunct 
and bankrupt state-owned enterprises. Several mining 
parastatals are already in joint-venture negotiations with 
major multinational mining corporations. Private sector 
development is a key objective of the Congolese government 
as a means to foster economic growth. Additionally, the 
exchange rate has freely floated for two years without 
significant government intervention. 
 
RULE OF LAW/POLITICAL PLURALISM/RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS 
 
4. Although the judicial system is still far from Western 
standards, the GDRC has made an effort to work with 
bilateral and multilateral donors to develop capacity 
building programs for the law enforcement and judiciary 
systems. Military and police training are improving the 
quality of Congolese law enforcement. Belgian and French 
trainers have, respectively, helped develop an entire army 
brigade and a rapid intervention police group. French 
Cooperation Agency and the EU are also working with the 
Ministry of Justice to improve the Congolese judicial 
system. 
 
5. Political pluralism is in a state of rebirth at present. 
The Transitional Government includes representatives from 
the political opposition in both the legislative and 
executive branches. There is no serious oppression of 
political parties and a variety of print and electronic news 
sources provide for a broad range of political debate. 
 
ELIMINATION OF BARRIERS TO U.S. TRADE AND INVESTMENT 
 
6. The GDRC is working with the World Bank to improve the 
investment climate in the DRC. New investment, mining, 
forestry and labor codes provide modern legal foundations 
for doing business in the DRC. Implementation of these laws 
is done on an ad hoc basis with the aid of the World Bank. 
For example, at Matadi and Kinshasa, the World Bank designed 
\"Guichet Unique\" provides a one-stop shop to pay all customs 
and port fees electronically. The National Investment 
Promotion Agency (ANAPI) also serves as a facilitator for 
investors exploring opportunities in the Congo. The DRC does 
not have any barriers specifically erected against U.S. 
trade or investment. 
 
ECONOMIC POLICIES TO REDUCE POVERTY 
 
7. The GDRC recently submitted its draft Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Plan (PRSP) to the IMF for review. The three main 
axes of the PRSP are peace consolidation, macroeconomic 
stabilization and pro-poor economic policies, and community 
led initiatives. The GDRC intends to put USD 80 million of 
funds liberated by HIPC debt relief to use in social 
spending and poverty reduction programs. (Note. Neither the 
Ministry of Plan - which handles the PRSP - nor the 
Presidency has given specifics on a timeframe for dedication 
of the funds. End Note.) Post does not expect that 
implementation of the PRSP will come in the near term. 
Meanwhile, per capita income has increased approximately USD 
10 since 2002, reaching USD 98 per year. Purchasing power 
has slightly increased as evidenced by increased purchases 
of staple food products. Sound monetary policy is helping to 
keep the exchange rate stable and give a modicum of security 
to the local population. 
 
SYSTEMS TO COMBAT CORRUPTION 
 
8. The Congolese government suffers from rampant 
institutionalized corruption. Civil servants are poorly paid 
or not paid at all. This environment breeds opportunistic 
behavior, and it is unlikely to fade away in the near 
future. Pressure by the World Bank and IMF to reduce 
government payrolls will help to make better use of salary 
budgeting giving less incentive to accept bribes or 
negotiate payments for services. 
 
9. In the past year, the GDRC has held several seminars to 
discuss anti-corruption. Most high-level government 
officials recognize that Western countries are interested in 
reducing corruption and make sure to mention that they are 
working toward that goal. The GDRC continues to work on 
several anti-corruption initiatives with NGOs such as the 
International Foundation for Elections Systems (IFES), 
National Democratic Institute (NDI) and Innovative Resource 
Management (IRM). However, no formal program or system has 
been established to fight corruption. 
 
PROTECTION OF WORKERS RIGHTS 
 
10. The New Labor Code, drafted with World Bank assistance, 
guarantees workers rights per International Labor 
Organization (ILO) standards. It quite often goes beyond the 
basic rights under the ILO and imposes heavy requirements on 
the employer, such as lodging, medical and transportation 
stipends. However, application of the law is not consistent. 
Workers in unions have the right to strike but must often 
resort to obtaining the support of the Minister of Labor to 
make headway with employers. As in most less developed 
countries, working conditions in industrial factories and 
mines, at times, do not meet Western hygiene and safety 
standards. However, the majority of the Congolese population 
(approximately from 80-90 percent) works in the informal 
sector and does not fit into a traditional employer-employee 
relationship. 
 
COMMENT AND RECOMMENDATION 
 
11. Post recommends that the DRC remain eligible for all 
aspects of AGOA, except the textile provisions. (Note. The 
DRC does not yet have an approved visa scheme for textiles. 
End Note.) The DRC is emerging from a six-year period of 
war. The Transitional Government is cautiously moving to 
implement new laws to foster investment and economic 
development and to reduce poverty. Although AGOA benefits 
are not fully enjoyed by the DRC due to a general 
unfamiliarity of the program, the DRC could begin to take 
advantage of the initiative in the future. AGOA has the 
potential to aid in the development and growth of the formal 
sector of the DRC economy, which is a stated goal of the 
GDRC. End Comment.

SUBJECT: ECONOMIC REPORT - AUG 13 THROUGH AUG 20 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1. Food prices have decreased due to the reopening of 
the Mai-Ndombe bridge.  Exchange rates remain stable, 
but the FC is trading at a slightly higher value on the 
Kinshasa parallel market than official rates.  The 
DRC\'s National Assembly created a commission to 
investigate Gecamines\' mining and contracting 
practices.  Cohydro opened a new gas station in 
Kinshasa.  Barge traffic resumed on a critical stretch 
of the Congo River between Ubundu and Kindu.  Contracts 
have been awarded for a World Bank IDA funded USD 100 
million project to repair National Routes No. 2 and No. 
4.  The Great Lakes States have signed an agreement 
laying the groundwork for a transit network linking the 
DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi.  MONUC plans 
to transport 1,000 tons of humanitarian assistance by 
rail between Ubundu and Kisangani over the next six 
months. 
 
MONETARY AND PRICE UPDATE 
 
2. Food prices dipped slightly due to the completion of 
repairs to the Mai-Ndombe bridge on National Route No. 
1 from Bandundu province to Kinshasa.  Overall, prices 
have decreased 0.8 percent this month. 
 
3. Exchange rates remain stable, but the FC is trading 
at a slightly higher value on the Kinshasa parallel 
market than official rates.  (Comment.  The difference 
between the parallel market and bank rate values is 
approximately FC 5.  This equates to only a few cents. 
Post does not believe the disparity to be significant, 
but will continue to monitor exchange rates closely. 
End Comment.)  Exchange rates in eastern DRC remain 
slightly elevated due to continuing tensions. 
 
MINING 
 
GDRC CREATES COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE GECAMINES 
 
4. The National Assembly of the DRC has formed a 
commission to investigate the mining and contracting 
practices of state-owned Gecamines.  The commission was 
called for by MP Mayombe Mbuyoko, and is composed of 
nine MPs.  The commission\'s investigation will last 
fifteen days, after which a report will be produced. 
 
PETROLEUM 
 
5. Vice President Yerodia Ndombasi commemorated the 
opening of a new gas station in Kinsuka, Kinshasa.  The 
station was built by the parastatal Cohydro and has a 
50 cubic meter storage capacity. This most recent 
opening follows the inauguration of new Cohydro 
stations in Kisangani (Orientale province), Mbuji-Mayi 
(Kasai Oriental province), and Mbandaka (Equateur 
privince). 
 
TRANSPORTATION 
 
UBUNDU-KINDU RIVER TRAFFIC RESUMES 
 
6. Barge traffic on the Congo River between Ubundu, 
Orientale province, and Kindu, Maniema province, has 
resumed after six years of inactivity.  The 350km 
stretch of river had been a primary regional trade and 
transportation route, but was closed during the civil 
war.  Office des Routes has donated a small barge to a 
local NGO, Solidarite Ville-Campagne, for three months 
in the hope of rekindling river commerce between Ubundu 
and Kindu.  (Comment.  River commerce along this route 
is particularly important because it fills a gap in the 
SNCC rail line between Kisangani, Orientale province, 
and southern and eastern DRC.  End Comment.) 
 
USD 100 MILLION AWARDED FOR REPAIR OF ROADS 
 
7. BCECO Director-General Mr. Matata Ponyo announced 
that contracts worth USD 100 million have been awarded 
to four companies for the rehabilitation of National 
Routes No. 2 and No. 4.  The project was funded by the 
World Bank\'s IDA.  National Route No. 2 will be 
repaired between Mbuji-Mayi and Kasongo (524km) and 
between Bukavu and Kasongo (496km).  National Route No. 
4 will be repaired between Kisangani and Niania (341mk) 
and between Niania and Beni (410km).  BCECO estimates 
that the project will take two months to complete. 
(Comment.  Two months is optimistic at best. 
Logistical difficulties and continuing instability will 
likely cause serious delays.  End Comment.) 
 
GREAT LAKES STATES SIGN TRANSIT AGREEMENT 
 
8. International press reports that representatives 
from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and the DRC have 
signed the Northern Corridor Transit Agreement.  The 
agreement outlines plans to link the five states by 
rail and waterway from the Kenyan port of Mombassa to 
the western coast of the DRC.  The transit network will 
utilize existing rail routes in Kenya and Uganda, and 
will require the construction of a new line from 
Kasese, Uganda to Kisangani, DRC.  The signing of the 
agreement paves the way for feasibility and design 
studies. 
 
HEALTH 
 
RESURGENCE OF EPIDEMICS 
 
9. The WHO reported significant increases in 
communicable disease infection rates in several DRC 
provinces.  Nord-Kivu and Sud-Kivu provinces reported 
5,511 cases of cholera with 147 fatalities.  Kasai 
Oriental and Equateur provinces reported 11,000 cases 
of meningitis with 1,357 fatalities.  Ituri province 
reported 80 cases of plague with 4 fatalities.  Several 
cases of viral hemorrhagic fever were reported in Kasai 
Oriental, Bandundu, and Sud-Kivu provinces.  The WHO 
attributes the recent rise in infection to the lack of 
access to clean drinking water, food, shelter, and 
medical facilities prevailing in the conflict-prone 
eastern DRC. 
 
AID 
 
10. MONUC plans to transport approximately 1,000 tons 
of humanitarian assistance by rail between Kisangani 
and Ubundu, Orientale province, to support the local 
population and improve access to the province for 
various aid organizations.  The WFP, OCHA, and SNCC 
(DRC railroad parastatal) will participate in the six- 
month project.

SUBJECT: NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN EASTERN CONGO COULD THREATEN 
TRANSITION 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
 1. (C)  Summary:  Following the funeral service for the 180 
victims of this weekend\'s massacre in the refugee camp in 
Gatumbe, events in eastern Congo took a turn for the worse. 
Rebel commander Nkunda issued an inflammatory declaration 
repudiating any prior connection he might have had to the 
transition government and calling for the institution of a 
new government, and at the same time moved significant 
numbers of his troops into more heavily fortified positions. 
It is unclear how, if at all, Monuc Bukavu would respond to a 
new attack against the city.  RCD-G VP Ruberwa and the 
majority of the RCD government ministers, together with a 
significant number of parliamentarians, are gathered in Goma, 
where they met August 17 with Governor Serufuli and regional 
military commander Obed.  Ruberwa is popularly supposed to be 
on the verge of quitting the transition.  The above plays out 
against a background of increasing hostility toward the RCD, 
Tutsis in general, and Ruberwa in particular.  The situation 
is not yet irreparable, but particularly potential military 
action and the RCD developments could pose a significant 
threat to the transition.  End Summary. 
 
 
Military Movements: Nkunda Shifting Ground, FAB At The Border 
 
 
2. (C)  Monuc Bukavu sources told polcouns August 16 that 
regional military commander Mbuza Mabe was reporting that 
rebel commander Nkunda\'s forces had begun an advance upon 
Bukavu from three directions.  A subsequent Monuc air 
reconnaissance August 17 indicated that Nkunda had 
consolidated some forces in Hombo and near Banyakiri, and had 
further fortified these sites with what appears to be 
artillery.  During a special CIAT meeting August 18 a Monuc 
military briefer reported that Nkunda\'s forces had clashed 
with government troops near Miti (not far from Hombo) during 
a southward movement from Numbi, Gungu and Itombo.  SRSG 
Swing reported that Nkunda had called him yesterday to assure 
Monuc that his statement was not intended to threaten the 
government.  Meanwhile, in response to Burundian troops 
gathering at the border in southern S. Kivu near Uvira 
(following a press statement by the Burundian military 
commander that he was prepared to invade the DRC in 
retaliation for this weekend\'s massacre), Mabe sent a 
battalion to reinforce the Congolese side of the border.  A 
Monuc Bukavu source subsequently told poloff that they have 
confirmed the presence of two brigades of RDF elements in 
Burundi, and said that apparently these elements are planning 
to join the Burundian forces poised at the Congolese border. 
Monuc reported that they have moved some troops from Bukavu 
to Uvira with the itent of maintaining highly visible patrols 
on the Bukavu-Uvira access.  In response to a question from a 
CIAT member, Swing confirmed that Monuc still commands only 
limited resources in the region to prevent a determined 
military movement, i.e., across the border or directed 
against Bukavu.  Meanwhile, hostility in Bukavu toward Monuc 
is already mounting again, as citizens apparently believe the 
worst. 
 
 
RCD Split Deepens, Ruberwa On The Verge.... 
 
3. (C)  RCD-G VP Azarias Ruberwa, together with the majority 
of the RCD ministers and a significant number of RCD 
parliamentarians, attended the August 17 burial of the 
Gatumbe massacre victims, and then went on to Goma, where 
most remain.  (Note:  Some of the RCD leaders chose not to go 
to the funeral, fearing that it was on one level a pretext to 
lure them from Kinshasa.  Others did attend, but already have 
returned to Kinshasa, expressing disgust for the \"hard 
liners\" in Goma.  End Note.)  The government and the MLC 
believe that Ruberwa is preparing to leave the transition; 
this concern reportedly prompted S. African President Mbeki 
to call Ruberwa in Goma August 17 to urge him to continue 
with the peace process.  RCD sources in Kinshasa told us 
August 18 that although Ruberwa personally could leave the 
transition, he does not have the authority to take the RCD, 
as a party, out of the government, because he does not have a 
quorum of Founders\' College members in Goma with him. 
(Comment:  This strikes us as a technicality which could be 
useful for the more moderate members of the RCD in the event 
that the party ruptures completely in coming days, which at 
the moment appears possible.  End Comment.)  MLC SecGen told 
PolCouns August 18 that the MLC has not yet formulated a 
policy in response to these recent developments, but rather 
is awaiting Ruberwa\'s press statement.  VP Bemba reportedly 
was considering calling Ruberwa to urge him to stay with the 
transition.  President Kabila, currently in Tanzania for a 
meeting on the Burundi peace process, reportedly will return 
soon to Kinshasa, perhaps as early as this evening. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
4. (C)  Government hardliners postulate that Ruberwa is 
staging a crisis in order to force concessions on military 
integration.  We think that is far-fetched.  It seems more 
likely that Ruberwa finds himself impaled on the horns of a 
dilemma, i.e., Kigali may be (as many here believe) demanding 
that he and the RCD leave the transition and he, Ruberwa, 
cannot see a way to avoid doing so.  In some ways, Nkunda\'s 
declaration simplifies the Kivus dynamic, as he has now 
voluntarily placed himself outside the pale, although the 
FADRC\'s ability to successfully implement the so-called 
military solution remains as dubious as ever.  The key to 
keeping the transition on track, we believe, lies in keeping 
Burundi and Rwanda out of the DRC, and Ruberwa in the fold. 
Certainly public talk of invading -- on any pretext -- only 
feeds DRC fears and contributes to instability.

1. (C) Summary:  I met privately with President Kabila on 
August 20, the day after Kabila,s return from the SAC summit 
and Burundi-related meeting in Dar es Salaam.  Kabila 
reiterated his absolute commitment to the transition process, 
notably including democratic elections slated for next year. 
He also observed, however, the necessity for adequate 
security and other conditions to maintain progress. 
Referring to last weekend,s massacre of refugees in Burundi, 
I emphasized the importance of all parties avoiding 
inflammatory rhetoric, and the need for cooperation among 
domestic leaders and regional governments.  In this regard, I 
noted USG efforts to organize the next tripartite session in 
Uganda, a subsequent planned visit of USG officials to 
Kinshasa, and my August 18 phone call to VP Ruberwa, all 
intended to support dialogue and overcome current tensions. 
Kabila said he would send a delegation to the tripartite out 
of respect for the USG, despite a lack of Rwandan cooperation 
to form a Joint Verification Mechanism, but said that must be 
the centerpoint of the Kampala meeting.  He also welcomed the 
Kinshasa visit of Washington officials, and my message to 
Ruberwa.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) At my request, I had a one-on-one meeting with 
President Joseph Kabila in his offices in Kinshasa on August 
20, the day after his return from the SADC summit in 
Mauritius, and his subsequent visit to Dar es Salaam to 
participate in a meetings and a regional summit scheduled to 
address Burundi issues.  This was the first private meeting 
and opportunity for a substantive exchange since I presented 
credentials on August 3 . 
 
 
The Transition Process Remains Central 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. (C) Kabila began by reiterating his absolute support to 
the transition process.  He noted he had made three solemn 
promises when he took office; ending the conflict, 
establishing a national unity government, and holding 
elections.  He said that the country has reached the second 
stage, the transition, and he is determined to move as 
planned to the holding of free, fair, and democratic 
elections next year.  He expressed appreciation to the 
international community and the USG in particular for the 
support shown to the DRC peace process and the transition.  I 
reaffirmed the importance we attach to the success of the 
transition and USG continuing support. 
 
 
The Need for Security 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Kabila noted that there are of course conditions 
needed for the successful holding of elections, notably 
adequate security conditions.  In this regard, he referred to 
current tensions in the country and region.  Picking up on 
the point, I made specific reference to last weekend,s 
attack on Congolese refugees in Burundi and reiterated points 
from the State Department communique issued earlier in the 
week.  I emphasized that the USG is calling for all parties 
to avoid inflammatory rhetoric to avoid further exacerbating 
tensions, and that we also wished to reinforce the need for 
dialogue and cooperation between governments in the Great 
Lakes region.  I offered congratulations for Kabila,s 
decision to stop in Dar es Salaam, expressing the hope that 
this provided an opportunity for contact with Burundian and 
other regional leaders. 
 
5. (C) Kabila summarized general agreements reached in Dar es 
Salaam, including the labeling of the FNL as a terrorist 
organization (Comment: All consistent with reporting from 
Embassy Bujumbura and public statements. End comment). 
Kabila also said that he had dispatched Army Chief of Staff 
General Mbuki,a former RCD-Goma general, to Bukavu and the 
plains of Russisi  to track down and take action for any 
reports of ex-FAR or other Hutu extremist elements in the 
area.  The Burundian President has asked about cross-border 
cooperation, and Kabila had passed along Gen. Mbuki,s 
telephone contact numbers to facilitate cross-border military 
cooperation. 
 
 
Next Tripartite Round 
-------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) In the same vein of regional contact, I noted that we 
believe it of even greater importance to hold the next round 
of the tripartite meetings between Uganda, Rwanda, and Congo 
officials as soon as possible.  While we had offered the 
possibility of Congo as a venue, Ugandan officials had 
indicated that they could not travel soon to Kinshasa, and we 
therefore were proposing the dates of August 24 - 25 in 
Kampala.  I also reported that following that meeting, NSC 
Sr. Africa Director Courville, DAS Yamamoto, and AF/C 
Director Eastham plan to travel to Kinshasa August 26 for 
meetings.  I also noted AF/C Director Eastham plans to travel 
to Bujumbura after Kinshasa. 
 
7. (C) Kabila expressed disappointment that Kinshasa would 
not be the venue for the next round.  He quickly went to say, 
however, that he would send a delegation to Kampala \"out of 
respect\" for the U.S. Government, and per his previous 
meetings with DAS Yamamoto and other officials.  He said that 
were it not for this respect, he would not be inclined to 
participate given the Rwandan government,s obstructionism to 
come to any agreement regarding the Joint Verification 
Mechanism (JVM).  Kabila noted that there had been an 
agreement for a JVM accord prior to the next tripartite 
round, whereas in fact there has been little to no progress. 
The GDRC is ready to proceed immediately per terms proposed 
by the U.N., and SRSG Swing has assured Kabila that MONUC can 
implement its support within 48 hours.  The JVM is central to 
adressing cross-border tensions and fears, and is critical to 
resolving problems.  For example, there is widespread 
suspision that Rwandans were involved in yesterday,s murder 
of FARDC officers in Goma.  If it already existed, the JVM 
could be used to address the problem, but as of now there is 
nothing.  Kabila said therefore that he will be instructing 
the GDRC delegation to ensure that the JVM is the item on the 
agenda, adding that he found it difficult to see how progress 
could be achieved on anything without some forward movement 
on the JVM. 
 
8. (C) Kabila said he welcomed the planned visit of the three 
officials to Kinshasa and looked forward to meeting with them 
on August 26. 
 
 
The Missing Ruberwa 
-------------------------- 
 
9. (C) I told Kabila that I had reached Vice President 
Ruberwa (note: who represents RCD-Goma) by phone Wednesday 
evening in Goma to convey a message reiterating the 
importance of the transition process and government for the 
future of the Congo, and specifically the interests and 
security of peoples in eastern Congo.  (note: Telcon being 
reported septel).  Kabila said that he had learned of 
Ruberwa,s continuing absence from Kinshasa following the 
Burundi refugee attack while he was already en route to the 
summit in Mauritius.  He had phoned Ruberwa with a similar 
message, accepting Ruberwa\'s proposal for an international 
inquiry, privately and publicly condemning the attack, but 
affirming the importance of Ruberwa,s continuing 
participation in the transition government.  Kabila said he 
has been unable since to reach Ruberwa, and Ruberwa has 
apparently made no attempt to contact him.  Kabila said he 
welcomed the message that I had conveyed. 
 
10. (C) I also reported that Ruberwa had encouraged me to 
visit Goma.  Kabila rhetorically asked why Ruberwa was trying 
to get everyone to Goma.  I said that Ruberwa ostensibly was 
seeking to encourage greater personal knowledge of the 
situation.  With much of the RCD leadership gathered in Goma 
right now,  however, I also noted that travel to Goma would 
inevitably be misinterpreted by many.  Kabila concurred, 
asserting that travel right now to Goma by the US Ambassador 
would certainly send the wrong message, and would be a \"very 
bad idea.\" 
 
11. (C) Kabila observed that Ruberwa had made \"three or four\" 
errors in the past few days that would likely cost. 
Nonetheless, he is a Vice President of the Republic, it is 
important for him to return to Kinshasa to make his 
contribution and play a role in the transition.  I said I had 
told Ruberwa that I hoped he would be in Kinshasa before the 
planned visit of the three USG officials.  Kabila echoed that 
sentiment, saying that he believed it would be useful for the 
American visitors to meet with Ruberwa in Kinshasa if 
possible. 
 
 
Sen. Kassebaum,s Visit 
---------------------------- 
 
12. (C) I also reported that Senator Nancy Kassebaum-Baker is 
planning to travel to the DRC, arriving on August 29.  I 
observed that this would likely cause scheduling problems due 
to the expected arrival by President Mbeki at around the same 
time, but expressed the hope that we could work out 
scheduling.   I explained that Sen. Kassebaum-Baker would be 
traveling not as a USG representative, but as a member of the 
Blair Commission.  Kabila acknowledged the scheduling 
problem, offered that perhaps Sen. Kassebaum could conduct 
travel outside of Kinshasa at the beginning of her visit, and 
hold meetings in Kinshasa later in the week.  He indicated 
that he would be pleased to meet with her following Mbeki,s 
departure. 
 
 
Comment 
----------- 
 
13. (C) Kabila showed his greatest emotion in discussing his 
perception of Rwandan foot-dragging regarding the Joint 
Verification Mechanism.  This clearly has risen to the top of 
the Congolese agenda for any discussion with the Rwandans, 
and it is a safe bet that it will be difficult to get the 
Congolese to discuss meaningfully other subjects without some 
forward movement on the JVM.  Kabila was also obviously 
concerned about Ruberwa, critical of some of his actions and 
statements, but reiterating the importance of Ruberwa,s, and 
by implication the RCD,s, continuing engagement in the 
transition process.  Kabila appeared frustrated by Ruberwa,s 
apparent unwillingness to talk, and indeed by the general 
growing tensions along the Rwandan border and in the east in 
general.  He at least however kept the door open to further 
talks on all fronts.  End comment.

SUBJECT: SERIOUS SITUATION IN EASTERN CONGO THREATENS 
REGIONAL PEACE 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 1. (C)  Summary:  Inflammatory rhetoric from Rwanda, Burundi 
and the DRC, coupled with the buildup of Burundian and 
Rwandan troops on the Congolese border and discord and 
disarray within one of the major parties in the Congolese 
transition threaten the fragile peace of the Great Lakes. 
South Africa is trying to broker talks between the RCD and 
the President\'s group, focused on relieving internal 
Congolese pressures and drawing a blueprint for saving the 
transition.  However, in terms of deterring an outbreak of 
fighting, the Congolese are looking to the international 
community, and the U.S. in particular.  The situation is 
salvageable, but a prompt, forceful and coordinated 
diplomatic intervention -- along the lines of that which 
helped defuse the Bukavu crisis -- is urgently needed.  End 
Summary. 
 
Looking Over the Gunbarrel 
 
2. (C)  Monuc Bukavu reports at least three brigades of 
Burundian troops poised near the border crossing at Uvira, 
and has confirmed the presence of at least two battalions of 
Rwandan RDF forces co-mingling with the FAB at that same 
site. Monuc also has forwarded to us reports of additional 
RDF forces (three brigades) on barracks alert.  In response 
to the buildup the Congolese military has deployed a brigade 
to the Uvira area, although the regional military commander 
admitted privately to Monuc that he doubted that the FADRC 
forces could long oppose a determined effort to cross the 
border.  Monuc and NGO sources report a buildup of military 
elements (Hutu local defense forces and/or RDF elements) in 
and near Minova, Kalehe, Dutu and other small villages near 
the lake -- all areas known as strongholds of rebel leader 
Nkunda.  In Goma itself, three non-Banyamulenge military 
officers have been strangled to death (reportedly by Nkunda\'s 
men) in the last day.  Nkunda himself arrived in Goma August 
20 in what one observer called \"a triumphal entry,\" 
accompanied by five truckloads of soldiers. 
 
Political Machinations 
 
 
3. (C)  RCD-G VP Ruberwa, who remains in Goma with a 
significant number of RCD ministers and some 
parliamentarians, reportedly has issued a call for all RCD 
members to come to Goma immediately, to take part in an 
announcement planned for this weekend.  An all-night meeting 
of RCD members at party headquarters in Kinshasa, apparently 
to \"vote\" on going to Goma, came as a surprise to moderates, 
who had not been informed that the meeting was to take place. 
 (Further details septel.)  A rupture in the party seems 
likely, almost certainly along ethnic lines.  The key 
question remains, however, whether Ruberwa himself will 
resign from the government and announce (with or without 
legal authority) that the RCD is no longer part of the 
transition.  We understand from RCD and government sources 
that S. African President Mbeki has summoned RCD and 
government elements for a meeting in Pretoria, to try to 
defuse tensions and salvage the transition by providing a 
blueprint for forward momentum.  Although Ruberwa himself 
remains in Goma, RCD sources say that at least two party 
hard-liners have gone to S. Africa.  The government appears 
still to be deciding who will represent them. 
 
Comment 
 
4. (C)  We appear to be facing a major threat to the 
transition government -- still our best, albeit flawed, means 
of getting to democratic elections -- as well as a resumption 
ofbroader armed conflict in the region.  The S. African 
initiative is helpful, but a broader diplomatic effort, such 
as that launched during the first Bukavu crisis, is urgently 
needed to remind all three parties to the current tense 
situation that they would face a high cost for allowing peace 
to fail.

SUBJECT: UPDATED CHILD LABOR INFORMATION 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 163453 
     B. 03 KINSHASA 2100 
 
1. Summary.  The GDRC has made nominal efforts to comply with 
international calls for child labor reform.  The resulting 
legislation provides a proper framework to fight the worst 
forms of child labor.  However, a lack of financing, 
personnel, transparency, and government follow-through has 
left the status quo relatively unaltered.  As long as the 
DRC\'s socioeconomic climate provides numerous incentives for 
and few alternatives to exploitative child labor, such 
practices will continue in the DRC.  End Summary. 
 
CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION IN THE DRC 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. The GDRC ratified ILO Convention 182 on March 28, 2001. 
On October 16, 2002, the GDRC passed law 015/2002, which 
mandated sweeping changes to the DRC\'s labor codes, 
especially relating to child labor.  The law also called for 
the establishment of a national committee on child labor to 
coordinate the GDRC\'s fight against the worst forms of child 
exploitation.  (Note.  National Labor Commission (NLC) 
approval and various ministerial decrees are still required 
before law 015/2002 can go into effect.  In the meantime, the 
national committee on child labor has been established, but 
has yet to be integrated into ministry-level policy work or 
conferred any investigative or punitive powers.  End Note.) 
 
3. In addition to the establishment of the national committee 
on child labor, technical highlights of law 015/2002 include: 
 
--Establishment of a minimum age for employment, including 
apprenticeships, of 15 years. 
 
--Definition of the worst forms of child labors as: a) all 
forms of slavery or slavery-like conditions, including 
trafficking of children, mandatory or forced labor, and 
forced military enrollment; b) use or recruitment of a child 
for prostitution, the production of pornography, or 
pornographic perfomances; c) work that might prejudice the 
child\'s health, security, dignity, or morality; and d) the 
use of children for illicit activities, especially in drug 
production or trafficking. 
 
--Establishment of a penalty of six months imprisonment and a 
fine of FC 30,000 (about USD 80) for each count of a child 
labor conviction. 
 
4. Comment.  A legal framework to fight the worst forms of 
child labor has been established in the DRC.  However, intial 
high-level support for actual reform has waned.  Law 015/2002 
is significant, but packs little punch without NLC approval 
and ministerial backing.  GDRC sources claim that the NLC and 
ministries of Labor, Social Affairs, and Family are 
\"reviewing\" the legislation.  End Comment. 
 
APPLICATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. The DRC Ministry of Labor investigates child labor abuses 
through its Inspection Generale du Travail (General Labor 
Inspection Service).  There are currently no inspectors 
specifically devoted to child labor, but the Ministry of 
Labor plans to create group of specialized child labor 
inspectors in its decree pursuant to law 015/2002. 
 
6. No specific information is available on the number of 
labor inspectors employed by the GDRC.  (Comment.  No 
specific information is available on the number of employees 
in most GDRC offices.  This is due to the general haziness of 
the civil service payroll, which has not been audited since 
shortly after independence.  Many employees work without pay, 
and many receive pay without working.  End Comment.) 
 
7. Child labor complaints are currently handled by the DRC\'s 
penal courts.  This responsibility is set to be transferred 
to the national commission on child labor once it is approved 
by the NLC.  (Comment.  Child labor law enforcement 
mechanisms often fall prey to the DRC\'s endemic corruption. 
Shifting authority from one inspection body to another will 
have little effect without an attendant increase in financing 
and accountability.  End Comment.) 
 
RELATED POLICIES AND PROGRAMS 
----------------------------- 
 
8. In recent months, the GDRC and the Congolese Armed Forces 
(FARDC) have demobilized large numbers of child soldiers, 
implemented procedures for the issuance of official 
demobilization certificates, and carefully considered the 
needs of children associated with armed groups in the 
planning and implementation of the World Bank-funded national 
disarmament, demobilization and reinsertion (DDR) program. 
The GDRC has also cooperated with MONUC investigations into 
cases of abuse against children, particularly child soldiers 
and children in prostitution.  However, there is much work 
left to be done throughout the country.  There are still a 
significant number of child soldiers within the ranks of the 
FARDC, a large number of girls engage in prostitution in 
order to earn money to survive, and an unknown number of 
children work in artisinal mining.  In addition, in areas not 
under central GDRC control, including parts of North and 
South Kivu provinces and the Ituri district of Province 
Orientale, the forcible recruitment of children by rebel 
groups continues. 
 
9. Compulsory education to age 15 is offical policy in the 
DRC, but, in practice, education is available only to those 
who can afford it.  UNDP statistics indicate a primary school 
enrollment rate of 35 percent and a secondary school rate of 
12 percent as of 2001/2002.  Children in the DRC receive an 
average of 4.3 years of schooling.  (Comment.  Most families 
who can afford to send children to school choose to send 
their male child(ren), presumably in the belief that they 
will have a better chance of obtaining future employment. 
This results in a severe gap in education levels between 
males and females in the DRC.  End Comment.) 
 
COMMENT AND PROGRESS REPORT 
--------------------------- 
 
10. The DRC has largely fulfilled the statutory requirements 
for compliance with ILO Convention 182.  Enforcement, 
however, is lax due to institutionalized corruption and 
bureaucratic disorganization.  Nevertheless, the DRC has made 
progress in sensistizing its population to child labor 
issues.  International pressure, work with MONUC\'s child 
protection program, and the presence of various children\'s 
rights NGOs have laid a foundation for more effective 
implementation of existing laws as bureacratic competency 
increases and economic conditions improve.

Classified By: Poloff Meghan Moore for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary: On August 16, moderate Banyamulenge community 
leader Enock Ruberangabo Sebineza told us that he was 
concerned about increased anti-Rwandan/ Banyamulenge 
sentiments in Kinshasa and eastern DRC. Many Congolese are 
again becoming increasingly hostile towards Rwanda, Ruberwa 
and the RCD/G, bringing back to the fore long-held 
perceptions of all Tutsis as Rwandan, and international 
community support of Rwandan interests over those of the 
Congo. On August 19, PPRD Secretary General Vital Kamerhe 
gave a press conference in Kinshasa PPRD condemning the 
Gatumba massacre, and offering the PPRD\'s condolences to the 
families of the victims. Most of his prepared remarks were 
relatively innocuous, but Kamerhe made a number of pointed 
jabs at Ruberwa and the RCD/G, Rwanda, and Burundi. End 
summary. 
 
Anti-Tutsi Sentiment Uptick 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Over the past several weeks, Post has noticed an 
uptick in anti-Tutsi and anti-Rwanda rhetoric in eastern DRC 
and Kinshasa. On August 16, two moderate Congolese told two 
poloffs that Ruberwa, who they claimed was clearly Rwandan, 
had planned the Gatumba massacre. The same day, moderate 
Banyamulenge community leader Enock Ruberangabo Sebineza told 
polcouns and poloff that he was concerned about increased 
anti-Rwandan/ Banyamulenge sentiments in Kinshasa and eastern 
DRC and found a \'discourse of hate\' during his recent trip to 
S. Kivu with the Truth and Reconciliation Committee. He said 
that Nkunda and Mutebusi\'s actions had poisoned average 
Congolese against most Tutsis who are now seen as Rwandan. 
Ruberangabo opined that any Rwandan intervention in the Congo 
could have disastrous consequences for the Banyamulenge and 
possibly other Congolese Rwandaphones. (Note: \'Rwandaphones\' 
are Congolese residents and/or citizens (both Tutsi and Hutu) 
who speak Kinyarwanda. Banyamulenge refers to a specific 
group of Tutsis from S. Kivu. Most non-Rwandaphone Congolese, 
however, regularly lump all Tutsis together as 
Banyamulenge---without factoring in whether they are from N. 
or S. Kivu, and whether or not they are long-term residents 
or recent refugees. End note.) 
 
3. (C) Speaking of Kinshasa, pol assistant said that many 
people are tired of the international community\'s support for 
the RCD/G, Ruberwa, and the Banyamulenge, who are only one of 
several hundred minority groups in the Congo and are already 
disproportionately represented within the transitional 
government. He said people are sad that 160 people were 
massacred at Gatumba, but many are mad that the international 
community only seems to care about the death of 160 
Banyamulenge and does not care about the death of 3.5 million 
Congolese, mostly non-Tutsi. Poloff said that moderate 
participants at a National Democratic Institute conference on 
nationality were booed on August 19. 
 
PPRD Secretary General\'s Rant 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) On August 19, PPRD Secretary General Vital Kamerhe 
gave a press conference attended mostly by PPRD loyalists at 
the Kinshasa PPRD headquarters condemning the Gatumba 
massacre, and offering the PPRD\'s condolences to the families 
of the victims. He criticized locally organized periods of 
mourning for the victims, saying that only the transition 
government has the right to declare such a commemoration. 
(Note: This was a slam at Ruberwa who organized a 
commemoration and a period of mourning in Goma. End note.) 
Kamerhe also said that the PPRD had told its members to pray 
for two days to \'save the transition\' and prevent future 
massacres. 
 
5. (SBU) Most of his prepared remarks were relatively 
innocuous, but Kamerhe made a number of pointed jabs at 
Ruberwa and the RCD/G, Rwanda, and Burundi. Kamerhe severely 
criticized Ruberwa for saying that Mai Mai were involved in 
the Gatumba massacre, and rhetorically asked if a vice 
president should blame his own country. He condemned press 
statements by certain politicians who repeated Rwandan and 
Burundian views that the Congolese are a genocidal people and 
said no one has the right to use this tragedy for political 
purposes or to justify another aggression against the DRC. 
Kamerhe said he knows there is a plan to transplant Rwanda 
and Burundi\'s ethnic conflict to the Congo, and the PPRD is 
convinced that a neighboring country has planned a third war 
which will be started by Congolese who will be used to kill 
other Congolese and facilitate the annexation of a part of 
the Congo. He invited churches, civil society, the government 
and political parties to refrain from adding fuel to the fire 
by accusing the innocent and peaceful people of the Congo and 
colluding with the nation\'s enemies for the sole purpose of 
accessing power. He opined that history will judge and the 
people will not forgive these acts of high treason. (Comment: 
The unnamed politician is clearly Ruberwa and the unnamed 
neighbor is clearly Rwanda. In addition, his invitation to 
refrain from adding fuel to the fire is a very pointed attack 
on Ruberwa and the RCD/G. End comment.) On August 20, pol 
assistant told polcouns that most Kinshasa residents agreed 
with Kamerhe\'s statement. 
 
Fueling the Fire 
---------------- 
 
6. (C) Despite the August 14 arrest of Pastor Ngoy, a 
notorious tele-evangelist who has incited hatred against 
Banyamulenge in the past, pro-government press in Kinshasa, 
notably RTNC radio and the newspaper L\'Avenir have recently 
broadcast and published a number of inflammatory items. 
L\'Avenir has run a series of vicious anti-Ruberwa and 
anti-Tutsi articles and editorials claiming that the term 
Congolese Tutsi is part of an ideology of victimization which 
causes ethnic hatred when the term is used, accusing Ruberwa 
of being Nkunda\'s accomplice, and suggesting that Ruberwa 
knew the Gatumba massacre would happen and made sure he was 
in eastern Congo when it happened. During an August 19 
evening broadcast, RTNC2 Radio claimed that there was a Tutsi 
conspiracy underway to create a Tutsi-led republic in the 
eastern Congo and encouraged listeners to express their anger 
against Congolese Tutsis. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) Anti-Rwandan sentiment has long been very strong in 
the DRC. Recent events, including talk from Kigali and 
Bujumbura of the possibility of new cross-border unilateral 
military action, dredges up the latent hostility. Feelings 
are also widespread that much of the international community, 
and specifically the United States, are willing to overlook 
invasions and other provocation coming from Kigali out of 
guilt over the 1994 genocide. Opportunistic hard-line 
politicians such as Kamerhe or Pastor Ngoy find it relatively 
easy to inflame further these emotions. A number of 
Banyamulenge and other Congolese Tutsi leaders have always 
felt themselves particularly vulnerable during periods of 
heightened tension, caught at times between Rwandan and/or 
Burundian policies with which they often do not necessarily 
support and deep mistrust or hostility from other segments of 
the Congolese population. The trick is to keep public 
rhetoric toned down as much as possible from all quarters to 
avoid another spiral of fear and potential violence.

Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  Recent events have highlighted internal 
divisions within the RCD ex-rebel movement.  RCD \"radicals,\" 
including virtually all the Rwandophones in the movement, 
want to quit or at least boycott the transitional government. 
 They have been pressuring \"moderates\" and other RCD members 
to travel to Goma, to particpate in memorial services for 
victims of the August 13 massacre of refugees in Burundi, and 
also to attend a general meeting of the party on August 23. 
We are examining the possible implications of a formal split 
in the RCD.  It would not be in our interest to allow the 
internal divisions of one ex-belligerent group to hold up the 
entire transition.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Radicals vs. Moderates 
---------------------- 
2. (C) The Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) ex-rebel 
movement is facing a serious internal crisis.  \"Radicals\" who 
want to put the transition on hold (and possibly quit the 
government) are increasingly at odds with \"moderates,\" who 
believe the RCD should stick with the transition and remain 
in government, despite the difficulties they have 
encountered.  Broadly, this cleavage corresponds to the 
group\'s ethnic makeup.  Virtually all RCD leaders of 
Rwandophone origin are in the \"radical\" camp, which includes 
parliamentary group leader Moise Nyarugabo and former RCD 
security-service chief Bizima Karaha.  In contrast, there are 
no prominent Rwandophones in the \"moderate\" camp, which 
includes figures such as RCD senior senator Dr. Emile Ilunga, 
education minister Joseph Mudumbi, defense minister 
Jean-Pierre Ondekane and economy minister Emile Ngoy.  It is 
unclear where RCD president Azarias Ruberwa stands.  Since 
the August 13 massacre in Burundi his rhetoric has been 
\"radical,\" but one RCD source speculated that he is a hostage 
(literally), and Ruberwa\'s diplomatic adviser vigorously 
denied on August 19 that the RCD was on the verge of quitting 
the transitional government. 
 
 
Location, Location, Location 
---------------------------- 
3. (C) Over the past several days, the radicals worked hard 
to persuade or strongarm RCD moderates and fence-sitters into 
traveling to Goma, ostensibly to participate in weeklong 
mourning ceremonies for the victims of the August 13 massacre 
in Burundi, and also to attend a general meeting of the party 
on August 23.  Multiple sources reported that RCD officials 
in Goma and Bukavu purchased airline tickets for their 
colleagues in Kinshasa, to prevent them from using lack of 
money to travel as an excuse.  According to two separate 
sources, RCD authorities in Goma tried to physically restrain 
Mudumbi and one other official to prevent them from returning 
to Kinshasa, but they successfully bullied their way through. 
 (Note:  As of August 22, seven RCD ministers and 
vice-ministers were either in or en route to Goma.  They 
were: telecoms minister Gertrude Kitembo, womens affairs 
minister Faida Mwangilwa, parastatals minister Celestin 
Vunabandi, labor minister Jean-Pierre Lola Kisanga, budget 
vice-minister Tresor Kapuku, international cooperation 
vice-minister Christian Kambinga, and interior vice-minister 
Tharcisse Habarugira.  Four remained in Kinshasa:  Mudumbi, 
Ondekane, Ngoy, and public works vice-minister Baudouin Banza 
Mukalay.  End Note.) 
 
4. (C) Ilunga told poloffs August 19 that he himself had 
received four phone calls that day, the first from \"a person 
in Kigali\" (NFI), urging him to travel to Goma.  He had 
refused to go several days earlier, because he thought it was 
\"a ruse.\"  The radicals are planning something, he said, but 
the rest of the RCD is in the dark.  Ilunga, who was RCD 
president approximately 1999-2000, explained on August 18 the 
importance of physical location:  when RCD leaders were 
headquartered in Goma, they had to support whatever Kigali 
advised, out of fear for their personal safety.  Kigali\'s 
influence has lessened since the RCD moved to Kinshasa, 
however--beyond Rwanda\'s reach.  This distance enabled other 
RCD leaders to resist Ruberwa\'s demand in June that the 
movement quit the government.  South Kivu vice-governor 
Thomas Nziratimana told poloff August 22 that the party\'s 
leadership, aka the \"College des Fondateurs,\" is scheduled 
meet at mid-day on August 23, after which Ruberwa will hold a 
press conference. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) If the \"radical\" wing decides to quit the government 
or suspend their participation, it could definitively split 
the RCD.  We are examining the possible implications of this 
and will report septel.  It would not be in our interest to 
allow the internal divisions of one ex-belligerent group to 
hold up the entire transition.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: RUBERA ON THE EDGE 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Roger Meece.  Reason 1.5 (b/d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  In a late August 18 telephone conversation, 
Vice President Ruberwa was unreceptive to the Ambassador,s 
message underscoring the importance of continuing engagement 
with the transition government.  Ruberwa complained that the 
status quo was doing nothing to improve the situation of 
Congolese Tutsis.  He did not, however, say that he is 
resigning his position.  Pressed, Ruberwa listed three 
actions that he said could represent a way forward, including 
an Mbeki or Obasanjo chaired meeting of GDRC principals to 
obtain commitments to progress, a regional gathering of 
governments to pledge actions against \"negative forces,\" and 
pressure to force the GDRC to make changes to government 
military deployments in the east.  We believe Ruberwa is 
likely to stay for some time in Goma, although not 
necessarily formally resign from the Government.  We assess 
his conditions to reflect in part personal frustration, but 
it also reflective of internal RCD problems.   End summary. 
 
Ruberwa and RCD/Goma Uncertainties 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (C)  Vice President Ruberwa is presently in Goma, North 
Kivu Province, following a scheduled tour of eastern Congo. 
As reported septels, Ruberwa went to Goma following the 
August 14 attack  on the Gatumba refugee camp in Burundi 
which targeted Congolese Tutsi refugees.  Ruberwa immediately 
issued several unhelpful public statements, which among other 
things accused Mai Mai and other Congolese of being involved 
in the Gatumba attack (Comment: Although to our knowledge, 
Ruberwa has no additional evidence of Congolese involvement 
beyond the somewhat confusing accounts of attack survivors. 
End comment). 
 
3. (C)  There is widespread speculation in Kinshasa that 
Ruberwa and/or the party he heads, RCD-Goma, is preparing to 
formally withdraw from the Transition Government.  As covered 
septels, there are major divisions within RCD-Goma, and 
certainly at least some members are advocating such a 
withdrawal. 
 
Ambassador,s August 18 Call 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) After multiple attempts starting the evening of August 
17, the Ambassador successfully reached Ruberwa by phone the 
evening of August 18.  Expressing condolences for the Gatumba 
attack, and reiterating points from the Washington-issued 
statement, the Ambassador nonetheless emphasized to Ruberwa 
the importance of remaining engaged in the Transition 
Government.  The basic message was that the GDRC transition 
process represents not only the best chance to bring peace 
and stability to the Congo, but as well ensure the security 
of vulnerable populations, notably including Tutsi 
communities, in eastern Congo. 
 
5. (C) Not surprisingly, Ruberwa did not embrace the message. 
 Instead, he launched into a lengthy explanation of why the 
Transition Government was failing in key objectives.  He said 
specifically many senior officials are still opposed to 
reconciliation leading to further criminal attacks such as 
that in the Burundi camp.  What is the point of continuing 
the process?  Ruberwa, however, stopped short of saying that 
he is resigning from the Vice Presidency or that his party or 
he himself are withdrawing formally from the transition 
government. 
 
Some View Forward 
------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Near the end of the conversation, pressed on what he 
believed represents a way forward, Ruberwa listed three 
points.  He indicated that a conference of GDRC principals, 
perhaps chaired by South Africa President Mbeki or Nigeria 
President Obasanjo, could be convened to obtain fresh 
commitments for progress, in essence correcting problems of 
the current transition.  Second, Ruberwa wanted changes made 
to the composition of the FARDC military forces in South 
Kivu, specifically including the removal of 10military region 
commander General Mabe, and an overall major reduction in the 
number of forces currently deployed.  Finally, Ruberwa called 
for a conference of regional leaders to promise firm action 
against \"negative forces\" (note: a traditional phrase used to 
refer to Hutu extremist elements.  End note).  Ruberwa asked 
for U.S. support in the CIAT and generally to achieve these 
goals. 
 
Comment: No Clear Strategy 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (C)  It did not appear that Ruberwa,s three points 
reflected well-considered positions, but rather more of an 
on-the-spot effort to define some objectives.  Much of 
Ruberwa,s reported actions and speech since the Gatumba 
attack suggest that he has been reacting emotionally, but has 
no planned long-term strategy.  As the RCD-Goma Vice 
President, Ruberwa has been been the object of sustained 
suspicion by much of the rest of the Congolese political 
class.  As well, he has more recently been buffeted by major 
public divisions within the RCD-Goma, with his leadership 
under challenge by Bizima Karaha and 7 other \"dissident\" 
parliamentarians and undoubtedly other influential RCD-Goma 
hard liners.  It is therefore difficult to determine how much 
of Ruberwa,s stated position stems from his personal 
convictions and frustrations, his current position under fire 
within RCD-Goma, or reflected views of the part of the 
RCD-Goma leadership currently gathered in the east.  He is 
reportedly hearing a similar message to the Ambassador,s 
regarding the need to stay engaged from a lot of sources in 
the international community, and from other moderate 
Congolese leaders.  We do not expect Ruberwa to return soon 
to Kinshasa, however, as he works out a personal and 
institutional way forward.

SUBJECT:  RECENT OFDA NOTES FROM ITURI 
 
 
----- 
Summary 
----- 
 
1. (U) During a visit to Ituri from July 19 to July 24, 
OFDA Reps noted improvements in security, both in Bunia 
town and in rural areas. There remains concern however 
that the situation remains inherently unstable given 
that there is no political settlement in place and that 
various militias remain extremely distrustful of one 
another.  No strong presence of the central 
transitional government of Kinshasa can yet be felt in 
Ituri, though Kinshasa has named and sent out a new 
District Commissioner.  The relative calm of recent 
months has brought a dramatic improvement in 
humanitarian access, which has in turn highlighted 
problems in the relationship between MONUC and 
humanitarian organizations.  Though the overall number 
of IDPs in Ituri is diminishing, little progress has 
yet been made in reducing the size of the large IDP 
camp near Bunia airport.  END SUMMARY 
 
2. (U) OFDA Reps Jay Nash and Ian MacNairn were in 
Ituri from July 19 to July 24, where they visited 
Kasenyi, Aru and Ariwara in addition to Bunia and met 
with both humanitarian staff and militiamen. 
 
----- 
Security 
----- 
 
3. (U) At the time of OFDA Rep Nash\'s last visit to 
Bunia in mid May, the town was still experiencing 
frequent shootings and armed robberies at night.  In 
July, security was reported to have improved 
considerably.  OFDA Reps were told by Bunia residents 
that militiamen of various types could be seen walking 
around with barely concealed weapons in peripheral 
areas at night, but people nevertheless generally felt 
that that town was much less dangerous than it had been 
at any time over the past year. 
 
4. (U) Though certainly partially attributable to 
increased MONUC foot patrols at night in the town, the 
improvement in security in Bunia is no doubt also due 
to a general decrease in inter-ethnic tension resulting 
from a decrease in incidents of inter-ethnic violence 
in rural areas outside Bunia.  During daytime hours, 
the town continues to grow more cosmopolitan and 
tolerant, with people of various ethnicity feeling 
increasingly comfortable walking into neighborhoods 
known to be dominated by members of one or another 
ethnic group.  Though people still largely stay close 
to their \"home\" neighborhoods at night, these also are 
slowly becoming less mono-ethnic.  Somewhat 
surprisingly, there are now some Hema families living 
in Nyambi - the area south of MONUC headquarters that 
has been nearly exclusively all non-Hema, non-Gegere 
for the past year.  Some Nande traders from North Kivu 
have started reestablishing their businesses in Bunia, 
and their trucks have begun arriving from Beni.  Gold 
trading has resumed, and there is again considerable 
foot traffic between Bunia and Mongbwalu, where the 
gold is mined.  As people involved in the gold trade 
must walk through the Gegere-dominated Mudzipela 
northern part of Bunia as well as Lendu areas on the 
way to Mongbwalu, this traffic itself is a sign of 
increasing tolerance and decreasing tension. 
 
5. (U) Outside Bunia, the trend in Ituri which started 
in December of 2003 of rural areas settling into 
distinct, but relatively peaceful \"zones of control\" - 
all completely outside MONUC\'s influence - has 
continued.  With the exception of the Hema pockets of 
Boga, Kasenyi, Tshomia and Sota, the area south of 
Bunia is under Ngiti control, with many Bira (who have 
no militia) also present.  The \"central\" area just 
north of Bunia is controlled by the Gegere-dominant 
Union des Patriotes Congolais (UPC) militia.  Between 
the UPC area and Mahagi, and to the west of Bunia, 
Lendu militias are in charge.   From Mahagi northward, 
Jerome Kakwavu\'s FAPC militia has authority.  Though 
(with the exception of Jerome\'s area), these zones are 
generally less ethnically diverse than they were before 
hostilities began in 1999, none are completely mono- 
ethnic and during the daytime there is considerable 
freedom of movement between zones for persons of 
various ethnicity.  Completely outside the framework of 
various MONUC and Ituri Interim Administration peace 
efforts, a number of communities of different ethnicity 
have made their own \"peace\" arrangements in the 
interest of reviving agricultural trade.  Among 
civilians, it is not uncommon to hear people of various 
groups even state with confidence that \"the ethnic war 
is over.\" 
 
6. (U) Though the relative calm has held for eight 
months now, many observers in Bunia still feel that the 
situation is inherently unstable and that in reality a 
permanent solution for Ituri is no closer than it was a 
year ago.  Many suspect that the UPC of Thomas Lubanga, 
at least, still has a political agenda which would 
include minimally control of the city of Bunia, and 
possibly much more.  The only thing currently 
preventing the UPC from attempting to make territorial 
advances is believed to be the threat of a MONUC 
response.   Though \"working arrangements\" between 
militias may exist, it would be a gross overstatement 
to say that militiamen, or especially their leaders, 
have come to trust each other and join in the popular 
belief that the war may be over.   In mid July, FAPC 
and Lendu militiamen skirmished for a couple of weeks 
in areas between Mahagi and Djugu, reportedly over 
access to \"taxes\" on trade.  In this case, MONUC was 
able to successfully negotiate a ceasefire with the two 
factions involved, and to prevent the conflict 
spreading to larger contingents of the same militias 
present in Mahagi itself.  Flare ups of this sort 
would, however, seem to be inevitable with so many 
boundaries in place and so much at stake in terms of 
trade revenue.  Any minor incident could conceivably 
spread quickly into a larger breakdown of order that 
MONUC might find very difficult to control. 
 
7. (U) The central fact remains that none of the 
militia leaders are solidly implicated in any overall 
new political order planned for Ituri.  In the past 
year, MONUC has failed entirely to arrange a political 
settlement that could serve as the basis for a 
scheduled dismantling of militias and separate 
administrations, the reintegration of populations and 
the return of central authority.  The MONUC-supported 
\"Interim Administration\" (IA) never succeeded in 
gaining effective politico-administrative control of 
any part of Ituri, including even the town of Bunia 
itself.  The IA has now been replaced by the 
administration of Petronille Vaweka, the new District 
Commissioner, appointed by the transitional government 
in Kinshasa.  Though generally respected as a 
courageous and strong leader, Vaweka still has no 
police or army with which to impose governmental 
authority anywhere.  The \"Ituri Brigade\" of the new, 
integrated national army is just beginning to deploy to 
Ituri, and at least part of this force is currently 
occupied trying to contain territorial advances by 
dissident general Laurent Nkunda operating out of the 
Kalehe area in South Kivu. 
8. (U) Though Iturians of all factions, as well as 
MONUC officials, have been appealing loudly for greater 
Kinshasa government involvement in Ituri since the 
Ugandans left in May of 2003, observers more familiar 
with the situation outside Ituri - i.e. with the 
current state of the transitional government and the 
degree of readiness of the new army - tend to be less 
sure that a greater transitional government presence in 
Ituri will automatically make for a huge improvement in 
the overall situation, especially if the government is 
not in a position to strongly support (with, for 
example, timely payment of salaries) those that are 
sent there.  It is no doubt the case that in their 
strong desire to see a return of Kinshasa to Ituri, the 
Iturians are to some degree remembering a time when 
Kinshasa was able to impose order in the region, and do 
not fully realize to what extent today\'s central 
government is significantly weaker than that of an 
earlier Mobutu era. 
 
----- 
Humanitarian access and relations between MONUC and the 
humanitarians 
----- 
 
9. (U) The relative calm that has come to Ituri has 
also brought a dramatic improvement in terms of 
humanitarian access, and with it something of a 
strategy dilemma for humanitarian agencies.  While the 
humanitarians\' credibility in the region can be said to 
have gone up as a result of their persistent efforts to 
reach and assist populations in need during the crisis, 
MONUC\'s credibility, never particularly great, has 
fallen through the floor, with MONUC now distrusted and 
despised by all the Ituri militia groups.  MONUC is 
resented both because whenever it imposes its authority 
it decreases the power of the militias, and because it 
is perceived to have made many promises that have not 
been kept, particularly with regard to the supplying of 
food and other benefits to promised sites of 
demobilization. 
 
10. (U) On the other hand, the militias, eager to have 
their populations obtain access to humanitarian 
assistance and anxious to show the outside world that 
they are not barbarians, but are instead capable of 
providing order and security within the territories 
they control, have grown more and more cooperative to 
humanitarians.  Humanitarians who make the effort to 
disassociate themselves with MONUC and contact the 
various militia leaders on their own to negotiate 
access can now move around relatively securely nearly 
anywhere in Ituri.  In contrast, MONUC cannot safely go 
more than a few kilometers outside Bunia town without 
armed guards, and MONUC personnel tend to be coldly 
received wherever they travel. 
 
11. (U) Among the international NGOs present in Ituri, 
German Agro Action (GAA) has so far gone the farthest 
in exploiting the new opportunities to reach rural 
populations.  Using a well-developed network of 
contacts, and establishing a transpartent relationship 
of trust simultaneously with all the different militias 
in the region, GAA can now travel pretty much anywhere 
in Ituri where there is a road after making just a few 
preliminary telephone calls. On various visits, OFDA 
Rep has accompanied GAA staff to meet with leaders of 
all the major militias, and in every instance the 
leaders have complimented GAA on their initiative in 
reaching their communities and communicated the same 
message:  other humanitarians are also more than 
welcome as long as they remain neutral and apolitical, 
and as long as they do not bring MONUC with them. 
 
12. (U) MONUC has never enjoyed good relations with the 
humanitarian agencies present in Ituri.  The 
humanitarians have long felt that MONUC, in addition to 
being a weak and largely ineffective military force, 
has generally manifested a poor intelligence capacity 
and a poor understanding of the situation.  As a 
result, they feel that MONUC has frequently misread the 
context on the ground, sometimes with catastrophic 
consequences.  MONUC personnel appear to the 
humanitarians to exude arrogance and paternalism, and 
the humanitarians feel that information they provide to 
MONUC rarely receives the attention it deserves. 
 
13. (U) The humanitarians also resent what they 
perceive as an effort to make them all fall under 
MONUC\'s overall authority.  Though the humanitarians 
readily acknowledge the necessity of the presence of a 
large international force, and though all ultimately 
have depended on MONUC for security whenever there has 
been open fighting in Bunia, they are keenly aware of 
the extent to which MONUC is disliked and distrusted by 
all the armed groups controlling the rural areas of the 
region, and would consequently like to maintain an 
independent identity and disassociate themselves with 
MONUC to the extent possible.  As UNOCHA staff told 
OFDA reps on this visit, \"if you travel with MONUC, you 
will not be well received.\"  MONUC, however, puts 
considerable pressure on all international 
organizations not to go anywhere outside Bunia without 
an armed MONUC escort.  With the exception of GAA, none 
of the INGOs have sufficiently large networks of 
contacts, or are sufficiently self-confident, to be 
willing to take responsibility for their own security 
by refusing the MONUC escorts.  (In the case of the UN 
Agencies, refusal is probably not even an option, given 
that the SRSG has authority not just over MONUC but 
over the entire UN team in DRC.) 
 
14. (U) An important aspect of the problem is that the 
humanitarians see their mandate as quite distinct from 
that of MONUC.  It is clear that MONUC has been given a 
political task in addition to its security function: 
it is supposed to be bringing the armed groups in Ituri 
together into a peace process.  This inevitably means 
using pressure at times to get the leaders of armed 
groups to agree to things they may not necessarily want 
to or like, and pressure always risks provoking the 
disfavor of those who may feel that they are being 
coerced.  The humanitarians, on the other hand, see 
their role as to remain apolitical and to provide 
assistance to those suffering the consequences of the 
conflict, regardless of the success or failure of 
various political initiatives.  To obtain and maintain 
access to vulnerable populations, the humanitarians 
feel that the militias must perceive them as being 
completely neutral.  This implies being viewed as 
separate and different from MONUC, since the militiamen 
often doubt MONUC\'s neutrality.  Moreover, the 
humanitarians are very aware that association with 
highly unpopular MONUC might on any given day have 
hugely undesirable consequences in terms of INGO 
personnel safety. 
 
15. (U) The difference in mandate does not appear to be 
completely appreciated by MONUC.  The MONUC 
headquarters in Bunia has made it clear to the 
humanitarians present in Ituri that it does not approve 
of INGOs having independent relations with the armed 
groups.  According to the humanitarians, the MONUC 
administration\'s view is that to successfully exert 
influence over the armed groups, the international 
community, including its humanitarian representatives, 
must be strongly cohesive and must always present a 
common front (with MONUC, it is assumed, setting the 
course and leading the way).  As these two perspectives 
are largely incompatible, every INGO attempting to work 
in Ituri finds itself frequently having to make 
difficult choices as to how to manage the relationship. 
 
16. (U) The question of INGO independence from MONUC 
can be expected to get even more difficult to manage in 
the near future as MONUC embarks on its joint 
disarmament/reintegration program with PNUD. There has 
already been at least one small crisis.  USAID/OFDA and 
GAA had agreed on a project to rehabilitate the Bogoro- 
Aveba road as a food-security initiative long before 
Aveba was selected by MONUC as a site for one of its 
new planned militia disarmament-demobilization camps. 
GAA had already discussed with the Ngiti communities 
along the road how the project would proceed, using the 
community-based approach that it found so successful on 
the Bunia-Kasenyi road, when MONUC, in a hurry to have 
the road fully operational so as to be able to readily 
ship supplies down to its future demobilization camp 
site, began pressuring GAA for a faster and more heavy- 
machinery-dependent approach.  Though some use of MONUC 
heavy equipment assets had always been planned, GAA had 
promised the communities to use local youth to do the 
work wherever possible, thereby providing the 
communities valuable employment opportunities.  MONUC 
now wanted to send their engineers and heavy equipment 
down immediately, and worse, planned to send them with 
an armed escort.   As MONUC was in serious disfavor 
with Ngiti groups at the time, having just arrested an 
important Ngiti leader, GAA was extremely concerned 
about appearances and the potential association of 
their team with MONUC soldiers (whose behavior GAA 
would not be able to control).  In the end, GAA was 
able to arrange that the MONUC road crew go without an 
armed escort while simultaneously quelling Ngiti fears 
of a MONUC invasion of their territory and a possible 
abduction of another of their leaders.  GAA is 
nevertheless concerned that the road project has now 
been irreversibly linked to in the minds of the Ngiti 
to MONUC\'s disarmament program, which they fear may 
eventually be viewed highly negatively by the 
communities. 
 
----- 
Disarmament 
----- 
 
17. (U) The humanitarian community in both Bunia and in 
Kinshasa continues to have deep reservations with 
regard to the appropriateness and quality of the 
disarmament/reintegration plan that MONUC and UNDP have 
adopted for the Ituri region.  In particular, they 
question the wisdom of embarking on any type of militia 
cantonment program before any viable political process 
is in place and seen to be moving forward.  They 
especially question the validity of a cantonment plan 
such as the present one in which MONUC will not be 
guaranteeing security at the sites and where it is as 
yet unclear that the transitional government is ready 
to receive some of the militiamen as candidates for the 
new army and transfer them out of Ituri.  In addition, 
there continues to be disagreement regarding whether 
the militias are ready and willing to disarm.  MONUC 
and UNDP insist that they have commitments from the 
armed groups.  Most others remaining skeptical that 
these commitments are sincere, given the lack of any 
accepted political settlement to Ituri\'s problems and 
communities\' persisting fears that they could be attack 
by their enemies.  Finally, there is disagreement even 
as to whether disarmament is an attainable and 
reasonable goal in Ituri, given the proximity of the 
district to abundant arms supplies in Sudan and Uganda. 
Some would argue that the emphasis should rather be on 
creating sufficient security and stability through a 
new political order so as to make the arms unnecessary 
and relatively valueless rather than on simply 
implementing an arms reduction program. 
 
18. (U) OFDA Rep\'s own conversations with militia 
commanders tend to substantiate skepticism with regard 
to the Ituri demobilization program.  In a conversation 
on this trip, FAPC commander General Jerome Kakwavu 
told OFDA Rep that he did not feel that this 
disarmament/demobilization process had anything to do 
with his forces, since the FAPC considered itself part 
of the transitional government and was only waiting for 
the procedures to be put in place to confirm their 
reintegration with the new national army.  With the 
exception of child soldiers, he did not see 
demobilization as being in the cards and warned that 
any attempt to forcefully disarm his men would be 
resisted with force.  In a meeting during a previous 
trip, Commander Linganga, the second in charge of the 
UPC command after Bosco, told OFDA Rep that they were 
willing to negotiate reintegration with the national 
army with the Kinshasa government, but would never 
disarm to MONUC.  In still other conversations, 
Commanders Germain (leader of the Ngiti militia) and 
Chief Kahwa (leader of the main Hema-South militia) 
expressed continuing high levels of distrust of UPC, 
suggesting they did not feel they were yet in a 
position to be able to let down their defenses. 
 
19. (U) The humanitarian community\'s reservations 
regarding the proposed disarmament program have been 
expressed repeatedly since November 2003 when the 
document first surfaced, but appear to have had little 
effect on the MONUC/UNDP plans.  September 1 has now 
been set as the opening date for the cantonment sites. 
(Though MONUC has started work on preparing the actual 
sites, few observers think that these will in fact be 
ready in the time frame specified and thus expect that 
the date will have to be pushed packed yet again).  At 
this point, the humanitarian community has given up 
resistance and is just hoping that the program will not 
be the large-scale fiasco that many are afraid it could 
be.  Few think that the program has much chance of 
success in doing anything to defuse the long-term 
threat of violence in Ituri.  Many think it has the 
potential to create new problems as MONUC will 
inevitably be unable to meet all the militiamen\'s 
expectations of the program. 
 
----- 
Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) 
----- 
 
20. (U) The IDP situation has greatly improved in 
Ituri, with more and more people able to return to 
their villages as a result of the relative calm that 
has reigned for the past eight months.  On a field trip 
into Lendu areas northwest of Bunia, OFDA reps saw many 
houses under construction, and MONUC has reported a 
major return of Gegere to the Fataki area.  Return is 
still problematic, however, for minority communities 
desiring to return to areas controlled by the militia 
of another ethnic group.  MONUC tried unsuccessfully, 
for example, to negotiate with Lendu and Ngiti leaders 
the return of former Hema residents of Bogoro, but were 
told that \"it was not yet time.\"  As Ituri originally 
had a very \"speckled\" ethnic make up, this problem 
minimally affects tens of thousands of people. 
 
21. (U) The IDP camp near the airport is reportedly 
down to an estimated 13,000 residents from a peak of 
15,000 last year, but movement out of the camp 
continues to be very slow.  Approximately two-thirds of 
camp residents are registered as being from the town of 
Bunia itself.  Several months ago, the thinking was 
that these people did not return home because a large 
number of houses had been destroyed or were now 
occupied by squatters.  Recent investigations conducted 
by INGO Atlas Logistic in several neighborhoods in 
Bunia, however, show clearly that this is not a problem 
in the vast majority of cases.  Given recent 
improvements in the security situation, danger would 
also not seem to be a valid justification for remaining 
in the camp.  It is now suspected that many camp 
residents continue to stay there simply because in the 
camp they have access to free food, free shelter and 
free education.  Those who own houses in the town can 
also make some money by renting out their homes. 
Despite offers of returnee packages to those who 
volunteer to leave the camp, the incentives still seem 
to fall more heavily on the side of staying.  Atlas 
Logistique and others are currently considering 
alternative strategies that might enjoy more success in 
encouraging a departure from the camp for those who 
could safely return to their homes. 
 
----- 
visit to Aru and Ariwara 
----- 
 
22. (U) To obtain a perspective on the mid-July 
fighting near Mahagi between Lendu militia and FAPC 
forces, as well as a sense as to whether further 
population displacements might be expected in the 
future in that area, OFDA Reps traveled briefly to Aru 
in northern Ituri, where they were invited to meet with 
General Jerome 40 km further north in Ariwara.  The 
young general was gracious and cordial throughout.  He 
praised USAID/OFDA partner German Agro Action for its 
work in the Aru-Mahagi area and assured OFDA Reps that 
other agencies would be most welcome to come to Aru. 
He guaranteed that humanitarians would be able to move 
about freely and in total security within all FAPC- 
controlled areas. While dismissing the Mahagi incidents 
as minor and stating that he believed the problems 
between the groups had been satisfactorily resolved, he 
confirmed that if FAPC positions were attacked again, 
they would again retaliate. 
 
23. (U) General Jerome took advantage of the 
opportunity to discuss other subjects of concern to 
him.  He categorically denied the rumors that he had 
any connection with the insurgency of General Laurant 
Nkunda in South Kivu, emphasizing that he was 
Congolese, had served long in the Congolese army, and 
had no allegiances elsewhere.   When asked whether he 
was at all optimistic about the future, he replied that 
he was not, given that he had been given reassurances 
by Kinshasa authorities that he and his administration 
would be integrated into the transitional government 
but that many weeks had since passed and there had been 
no noticeable progress. He was now wondering whether 
the TG had really negotiated in good faith.  He urged 
the USAID delegation to encourage the USG to exert 
pressure, through the Ambassador\'s role as a member of 
the CIAT, to move more quickly on integration of the 
army and administration.  He said that the FAPC was 
open to Kinshasa\'s appointment of new authorities to 
the Aru-Mahagi area, but felt that before doing so, 
Kinshasa should examine the performance of the FAPC 
appointees presently in place and either decide to 
retain them or find appropriate new appointments for 
them elsewhere, since in his estimation they had been 
doing an excellent job.  The general commented that he 
did not himself feel that his future was necessarily 
tied to that of the Ituri region, since he was not 
himself an Iturian. 
 
24. (U) The general highlighted the multi-ethnic 
composition of his military and civil administration 
and pointed out that the Aru area, under FAPC 
direction,  remained extremely orderly and was an 
economic success.   The FAPC had made Aru a place, he 
said, where business and development could be conducted 
in a completely secure environment.  With regards to 
demobilization, Jerome said that though the FAPC would 
certainly be willing to demobilize any child soldiers 
in its ranks, everyone else should be absorbed into the 
new Congolese army.  If it was determined that some 
candidates were too old to continue service, or not 
sufficiently fit, they should be provided 
transportation back to their home areas and given a 
retirement package as part of their demobilization. 
 
25. (U) Back in Aru, after the meeting with General 
Jerome in Ariwara, a close aid to the general rather 
passionately expressed his personal view that it would 
be a mistake to classify Jerome as having much in 
common with such dissident Tutsi commanders as Mutebusi 
and Nkunda.   The aide claimed to have grown up in the 
Goma area with both Jerome and Nkunda, and to know them 
both well.  While he was clearly a fan of Jerome, the 
aide viewed Nkunda as extremely \"arrogant,\" and was 
sure that Nkunda\'s Bukavu intervention had been largely 
planned by General Bora, whom he believed was trying to 
use some territorial acquisitions in South Kivu as 
leverage to negotiate amnesty and acceptable high-level 
positions for himself and Nkunda in the TG.  According 
to the aide, Bora and Nkunda had been counting on Vice- 
President Ruberwa to support their bid, and that the 
plan had fallen apart when this did not happen.  MEECE.

SUBJECT: AFRICAN CANAL A PIPE(LINE) DREAM 
 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.5b/d. 
 
1. (C) Summary.  The DRC Ministry of Energy reported that a 
regional delegation with strong backing from Nigerian 
President Obasanjo visited Kinshasa to discuss a proposed 
canal linking the Congo River with Lake Chad.  Involved 
parties include Nigeria, Chad, Niger, Cameroon, 
Congo-Brazzaville, the Central African Republic, and Libya. 
The project is politically and economically impractical, but 
various GDRC officals may be entertaining the proposal in 
attempts to garner regional support.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) On August 19 Econoffs met with a high ranking official 
of the Ministry of Energy to discuss matters relating to 
electrical power and foreign direct investment in the DRC. 
The official instead steered the conversation towards recent 
meetings between the GDRC and a foreign delegation known as 
the Lake Chad Commission (LCC). 
 
3. (C) The LCC is composed of Ministry of Energy officials 
and MPs from Chad, Nigeria, Niger, and Cameroon.  On August 
10, 2004, the LCC came to Kinshasa aboard Nigerian President 
Obasanjo\'s private aircraft for meetings with the DRC 
Minister of Energy.  The LCC is seeking GDRC approval for the 
construction of a canal from the Ubangi River to Lake Chad. 
(Note.  The Ubangi River on the border between the DRC\'s 
Equateur province, Congo-Brazzaville, and the Central African 
Republic is the major northern branch of the Congo River. 
Lake Chad lies on the border between Chad and Cameroon, and 
has been decreasing in size since the 1960s due to diversion 
of its waters for irrigation.  End Note.) 
 
4. (C) Other parties interested in the project include 
Congo-Brazzaville, the Central African Republic (whose 
territory the proposed canal would traverse) and Muammar 
Qaddafi (who is reportedly seeking to divert some of the 
proposed canal\'s water to Libya via pipeline).  According to 
source, Obasanjo not only loaned the LCC his plane, but has 
also apparently agreed to fund USD 2.5 million of the 
project\'s costs, with USD 1 million already released for 
feasability studies. 
 
5. (C) The Ministry of Energy is extremely skeptical of the 
proposal.  Source cited a number of concerns including 
project costs, environmental impact, continuing regional 
instability, and low Congo River water levels as possible 
impediments to a canal.  The Ministry of Energy is aware of 
the potential problems of diverting a portion of the river\'s 
water because it oversees SNEL, the electricity parastatal. 
SNEL runs and maintains the Inga hydroelectric complex, and 
is experiencing a severe shortage of generating capacity due 
to low Congo River water levels.  With Kinshasa bracing for 
rolling blackouts, the idea of diverting the river not only 
seems economically unsound, but also politically disastrous. 
 
6. (C) The Nigerian delegate, Bashir Ishola Awotorebo, 
pitched the project as a move toward regional integration, 
painting a picture of \"boats traveling on a canal from West 
Africa to the DRC.\"  Source believes that the Nigerians are 
merely seeking access to the DRC\'s freshwater resources. 
 
7. (C) Source opined that the proposal would likely be 
dismissed out of hand were it not for Obasanjo\'s support. 
(Comment.  The DRC views Obasanjo as one of Africa\'s most 
powerful statesmen.  Source repeatedly noted Obasanjo\'s 
contacts with President George W. Bush.  The perception that 
Obasanjo has the ear of the American president lends him 
further influence in the region.  End Comment.) 
 
8. (C) Officially, the LCC is seeking cooperation with the 
DRC transitional government.  However, Obasanjo, et al are 
purportedly hedging their bets through high-level contacts 
with MLC and even RCD-G officials in preparation for a 
government reshuffling.  While no material support for 
opposition parties was mentioned, source noted that numerous 
promises of political support have been exchanged.  DRC 
President Kabila met earlier this month with Obasanjo in 
Lagos.  Vice President Bemba of the MLC has also recently 
traveled to Libya and Congo-Brazzaville.  While it is 
possible that the canal issue was discussed, no official 
mention of the project has yet been made by GDRC officials. 
 
9. (C) Comment.  While the idea of a Congo-Lake Chad canal is 
somewhat outlandish, foreign support for the project could 
significantly effect the DRC\'s internal political dynamics if 
LCC advances are taken seriously within the government.  Many 
high-ranking officials in the GDRC would prefer to avoid 
elections, they view them as inevitable.  Hence, postponing 
elections while collecting war chests from regional powers is 
a possible motivation for entertaining the LCC proposal.  To 
its credit, the Ministry of Energy appears to have brushed 
the topic aside. 
 
10. (C) Comment Continued.  Reports of Obasanjo\'s politicking 
provide further evidence of external forces acting as 
divisive elements in transitional government politics.  Most 
importantly, the canal proposal shows that foreign 
governments once again perceive the DRC as ripe for 
exploitation.  It is unclear why source brought up Obasanjo 
in such a negative light.  Source is in a PPRD controlled 
ministry, is close to former National Security Advisor Jean 
Mbuyu, and is perhaps trying to portray Obasanjo as having 
blurred the line between arbitration and personal interest at 
the recent Abuja summit.  End Comment.

1. (U) Sensitive but Unclassified, Privileged Business 
Information. Not for Internet distribution. 
 
2. (SBU) Embassy Kinshasa has reviewed the application for 
political risk insurance that International Rescue Committee 
(IRC) has submitted to OPIC. IRC has operated in the DRC for 
almost the entire duration of the civil war and continues to 
operate during the reconstruction period. Overall, IRC 
provides a beneficial humanitarian assistance program and 
does have some activities, which, on a micro-level, promote 
private ownership (Habitat for Humanity), environmental 
protection (safe water well construction) and physical 
infrastructure (some road and levee projects). However, 
answers to number 33(c/d) are exaggerated. IRC programs are 
not being implemented in the context of a government 
regulatory, judicial or other institutional reform program 
and neither will they result in GDRC implementation of 
institutional reforms. Otherwise, Embassy Kinshasa views the 
IRC application favorably and has no objections to granting 
of insurance. 
 
3. (SBU) The following responds to the specific questions 
listed in the OPIC request for Embassy comments: 
 
a. As IRC\'s primary operations are of humanitarian relief, 
there are no potential negative public or host government 
sentiment toward the project. 
 
b. Post does not foresee possible negative impacts on U.S. 
policy and interests in the DRC resulting from this project. 
 
c. IRC is a well established NGO in the field of humanitarian 
assistance. Post does not view its integrity as questionable. 
 
d. Post does not foresee any serious adverse environmental 
effects associated with the project. 
 
e. IRC\'s operations do not conflict with the DRC\'s economic 
objectives or welfare. 
 
f. Post has no indications of uneconomic use of raw materials 
or labor. 
 
g. Subject project is of humanitarian assistance, funded by 
bilateral and multilateral donors. It will not have any 
affect on the DRC\'s balance of payments.

SUBJECT: RUBERWA SUSPENDS PARTICIPATION IN TRANSITION 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1576 
 
Classified By: Poloff Meghan Moore for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. Summary: On August 23, RCD/G VP Azarias Ruberwa announced 
that the RCD/G had suspended its activities in the transition 
government and called for an international mediator to hold 
discussions to break the current impasse. Ruberwa, however, 
left the door open by  suspending, his participation and 
not resigning from the transition. Secret talks facilitated 
by South Africa between the RCD/G and the PPRD scheduled for 
the weekend of August 21 never took place because they were 
leaked into the public domain. On August 21, N. Kivu Governor 
Eugene Serufuli and Gen Obedi issued an arrest warrant for 
Nkunda with the tacit support of VP Ruberwa. As of August 24, 
Nkunda had not been apprehended. Going forward, the RCD/G is 
likely to look for progress on military integration, 
specifically the establishment of a supreme defense council, 
a decrease in the relative power and influence of the maison 
militaire (the President,s parallel defense structure), and 
the removal of a large number of troops the FARDC has 
deployed out east over the past few months. End Summary. 
 
Ruberwa Suspends Participation in Transition 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. (C) At a press conference the night of August 23, VP 
Azarias Ruberwa said that the RCD/G had suspended its 
activities in the transition government, and called for an 
international mediator to hold discussions to break the 
current impasse (septel). On August 23, Dr. Emile Ilunga and 
other RCD/G moderates in Kinshasa drafted a press communique 
stating that they disagreed with Ruberwa and planned to 
continue their participation in the transition (septel). 
 
Secret Talks Scuttled 
 
SIPDIS 
--------------------- 
 
3. (C) On August 24, a Presidential Advisor told polcouns 
that scheduled secret talks in South Africa between the RCD/G 
and the PPRD never took place because they were leaked into 
the public domain.  Although RCD/G representatives Moise 
Nyarugabo (Leader of the RCD/G parliamentary group), Matadi 
Nenga (1st VP of the RCD) and Adolphe Onusumba (a senior 
parliamentarian and former RCD president) went to South 
Africa, Kabila,s representatives never joined them. On 
August 23, a western journalist told poloff that Nyarugabo, 
who returned to Goma the night of August 22, was spitting 
venom at the PPRD about both the canceled meeting, and PPRD 
Secretary General Kamerhe,s August 19 speech. (reftel)

Serufuli Issues Nkunda Arrest Warrant 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) On August 21, N. Kivu Governor Eugene Serufuli told 
polcouns that he and Gen Obedi had issued an arrest warrant 
for Nkunda with the tacit support of VP Ruberwa. As of August 
24, Nkunda had not been apprehended. His exact whereabouts 
are unknown, but he is rumored to be in Gisenyi. (Comment: It 
is highly likely that Serufuli issued this arrest warrant 
after warning Nkunda to stay out of sight. End comment.) A 
number of sources in Goma, including  S. Kivu Vice Governor 
Thomas Nziratimana have told poloffs that Nkunda, who by all 
accounts was not very stable to begin with, is now behaving 
like a  mad, man. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) It is important to note that Ruberwa left the door 
open by  suspending, his participation and not resigning 
from the transition. This declaration amounts to what Ruberwa 
called for last week*a pause in the transition to address 
problems. It appears to mean that he was unable to convince 
RCD-Goma hardliners to continue with the status quo. Going 
forward, the RCD/G is likely to look for progress on military 
integration, specifically the establishment of a supreme 
defense council and a decrease in the relative power and 
influence of the maison militaire (the President,s parallel 
defense structure).

SUBJECT: UPDATE ON DRC REFUGEE REPATRIATION AND RECENT 
INTERNAL DISPLACEMENTS 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. UNHCR plans to transfer survivors from the 
Gatumba massacre in Burundi to camps away from the DRC border 
within 10 days. In the meantime, the Burundian government has 
strengthened security in the Gatumba school where these 
refugees are being housed. It is unlikely that Congolese 
refugees will return from Rwanda or Burundi until the 
volatile situation in South Kivu improves. Repatriation of 
Angolan refugees is proceeding well, while expulsion of 
undocumented Congolese miners from Angola has resumed in a 
more orderly fashion. The UN reports that over 120,000 
civilians have been internally displaced in the DRC during 
the past several months as a result of insecurity and clashes 
involving various armed groups and in some instances FARDC 
forces in North and South Kivu, and Orientale Province. End 
Summary. 
 
 
Congolese Refugees from Gatumba to be Moved Inland 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (U) Poloff met with acting UNHCR representative for the 
DRC, Mohamed Dayri, August 23, to discuss the situation of 
Congolese refugees at Gatumba, Burundi. Dayri said that at 
the time of the massacre on August 13, there were 
approximately 800 refugees at the Gatumba camp. Following 
this incident, survivors have been relocated to a nearby 
school in Gatumba pending transfer to refugee camps in Banya, 
near Bujumbura and Rutana, near the Tanzanian border. This 
transfer is expected to take place within the next ten days. 
In the meantime, the Burundian government has increased its 
military presence in Gatumba to improve security. 
 
3. (U) Dayri indicated that at the time of the massacre of 
Congolese refugees there were only nine officers at the camp 
to provide security. He noted that under UN Security Council 
resolutions 1208 and 1296, host countries are responsible for 
providing physical protection to refugees. 
 
Refugees in Rwanda and Burundi Unlikely to Return to DRC Soon 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
4. (U) UNHCR-Kinshasa estimates that there are about 3,000 
Congolese refugees at the Cyangungu Transit center in Rwanda 
who fled fighting in Bukavu during the months of May and 
June. There are also over 30,000 Congolese refugees in 
Burundi who fled during the month of June. Despite recent 
pleas by DRC Vice-President Azarias Ruberwa for the return of 
these refugees, UNHCR thinks that it is unlikely that most 
refugees will return to the DRC from Rwanda and Burundi while 
the situation in South Kivu remains volatile. However, a 
small number of Banyamulenge refugees who fled from Bukavu 
have expressed interest in returning to the predominantly 
Banyamulenge area of Minembwe, South Kivu. 
 
 
Expulsion of Undocumented Congolese Miners from Angola Resumes 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
5. (U) UNHCR indicated that the Angolan government resumed 
expulsion of undocumented Congolese diamond miners July 16. 
Since then, approximately 60,000 people have crossed the 
border into the Congo. However, unlike the 60,000 that were 
expelled between December and May, this new wave of 
expulsions have been conducted in an orderly fashion. UNHCR 
has not received any reports of abuse or harassment. Although 
UNHCR does not normally work with this type of population 
since they are not considered refugees, but undocumented 
immigrants, they have provided humanitarian assistance, 
mainly in the form of transportation. This has been done in 
an effort to avoid negative reactions from the Congolese such 
as those which took place during the earlier expulsions. 
 
 
Repatriation of Angolans in DRC Going Well 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (U) According to Dayri, the repatriation of Angolan 
refugees in the DRC is proceeding smoothly. Since 
repatriation started in July, over 6,000 people have been 
repatriated by UNHCR from Bas-Congo and Katanga provinces. 
This repatriation will continue until the rainy season makes 
the roads impassable. UNHCR\'s goal is to have repatriated 
32,000 Angolans by the end of the year. This will leave 
approximately 13,000 Angolans to be repatriated in 2005. 
Dayri noted that repatriation of Angolans from Bandundu will 
be more difficult since they come from the Angolan provinces 
of Malange and Lunda, where the necessary de-mining has yet 
to be done. 
 
7. (U) Dayri indicated that 215 Angolan urban refugees from 
Kinshasa were successfully repatriated back to Luanda August 
22. UNHCR spent 18 months negotiating this complicated 
repatriation with the Angolan government, which has been 
reluctant to repatriate refugees to the capital. UNHCR hopes 
to repatriate another group of 200 urban refugees to Luanda 
by the end of this year. 
 
Prospects for Sudanese Refugees in DRC 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Dayri indicated that UNHCR is hoping to start the 
repatriation of approximately 30,000 Sudanese refugees in 
October or November; 11,000 have already been registered, the 
remainder are scattered in Northern Orientale Province where 
they are engaged in trade and agricultural activities. 
 
120,000 New IDPs in North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
9. (U) Poloff met with Noel Tsekouras, humanitarian affairs 
officer with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA) August 23, to discuss the current situation of 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the DRC. According to 
Noel, as of August 2004, there are an estimated 2,329,000 
IDPs in the country. OCHA also estimates that approximately 
725,000 IDPs have returned to their areas of original 
displacement over the past several months. The largest areas 
of IDPs remain North Kivu with 785,000, Province Orientale 
with 455,000, Katanga with 365,000 and South Kivu with 
254,000. 
 
10. (U) According to OCHA, the most significant new 
displacements of civilians in the past few months have taken 
place in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri. In North Kivu, 
OCHA estimates that 35,000-55,000 people were displaced 
during the preceding eight months, primarily in the areas of 
Ruthsuru, Masisi and Walikale. Most of this displacement has 
been due to clashes involving Rwandan Hutu armed groups 
(Interhamwe-FDLR) and FARDC\'s 8th military region. In South 
Kivu, approximately 30,000 people were displaced south of 
Kalehe during the month of July. An additional 6,000 were 
displaced north of this area during the same period. Most of 
these displacements were a result of fear of clashes between 
dissident RCD-G General Laurent Nkunda and FARDC troops. OCHA 
coordinated humanitarian assistance to both groups. In 
Province Orientale, Ituri District, approximately 30,000 
people were displaced in Mahagi following fighting between 
the Nationalist Integrationist Front (FNI) and the Popular 
Armed Forces of the Congo (FAPC) militias. Due to security 
concerns and inaccessible terrain, OCHA has relied on NGOs 
already in the area to provide assistance to IDPs in North 
Kivu and Orientale Province. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (U) UNHCR has been successfully repatriating Angolan 
refugees over the past several weeks, while at the same time 
assisting undocumented Congolese expelled from Angola. 
UNHCR\'s constructive engagement with DRC and Angolan 
authorities has lessened tensions and resulted in a more 
humane process for the return of both populations. The 
situation of Congolese refugees in Rwanda and Burundi, on the 
other hand, is much more complex. UNHCR-Kinshasa will have to 
work closely with offices in Kigali and Bujumbura to ensure 
the protection of these refugees until conditions are 
appropriate for repatriation and to lessen their possible 
political manipulation by regional actors. 
 
12. (U) Instability in the east over the past several months 
has resulted in new IDPs in the Kivus and Ituri. UN agencies 
and NGOs have been hard pressed to provide humanitarian 
assistance to the majority of these people due to insecurity 
and inaccessible of areas of displacement. New IDP movements 
only complicate an already dire humanitarian situation in the 
east. UN agencies, NGOs and the GDRC should coordinate 
efforts to provide emergency assistance and as the security 
situation in areas of displacement improves, should encourage 
and assist IDPs to return to their areas of origin. To 
address the IDP situation in the longer term it will be 
necessary to demobilize armed groups, create a unified 
national army, and re-establish state authority in the east.

SUBJECT: FARDC\'S FIRST INTEGRATED ARMY BATTALION DEPLOYED 
TO ITURI 
 
Classified By: Poloff Gons Nachman for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (U) Summary. The first battalion of the Armed Forces of 
the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) was deployed to 
Ituri the week of August 16. MONUC views this initial 
deployment of 750 soldiers as a test of FARDC\'s commitment to 
support its soldiers. These soldiers will serve in 
peace-keeping support operations such as guarding 
installations. MONUC is cautiously optimistic that with 
appropriate guidance and support, this brigade will be able 
to make a positive difference in Ituri, although this remains 
to be seen. End Summary. 
 
FARDC Deploys Battalion with Promises of Support 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (C) Poloff met with Gerold Gerard, MONUC senior poloff 
August 24, to discuss deployment of the first battalion of 
FARDC\'s integrated brigade to Ituri during the week of August 
16. The first 750 soldiers were deployed to Bunia with basic 
transportation equipment donated by Belgium, arms provided by 
the GDRC, and a promise to MONUC from General Kisempia, Chief 
of Staff of the Congolese Armed Forces, that FARDC would 
provide salaries to these soldiers on a regular basis. 
 
MONUC Supports Deployment: Time to Test FARDC\'s Commitment 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
3. (C) Gerald said that MONUC was supportive of this initial 
deployment of FARDC\'s integrated brigade to Ituri. FARDC does 
not have the resources to deploy the second and third 
battalions of this brigade before November or December. This 
will give MONUC sufficient time to evaluate the performance 
of the first group of soldiers and the level of support 
provided by the GDRC. It will also free UN peace-keepers from 
simple static tasks like guarding the tribunals, the prison, 
and other facilities. 
 
4. (C) According to Gerard, Ituri armed groups have said in 
the past that they did not want to negotiate with MONUC, but 
with a Congolese army. They have advocated for the presence 
of an unified army in Ituri and the reintegration of the 
district into the national territory. Now there is an 
integrated national army presence in Ituri as demanded, and a 
new district commissioner and local administrators appointed 
by the national government. 
 
5. (C) Gerard noted that the first contingent of FARDC\'s 
brigade could also assist MONUC in providing security at 
transit sites for disarmament of militias under the 
demobilization and community reinsertion (DRC) program due to 
start September 1st. He said that fifty to sixty FARDC 
soldiers could be deployed to each of the five transit sites 
in Ituri to address security concerns by militias who are 
reluctant to disarm. 
 
Obstacles to Disarmament in Ituri Remain 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Although MONUC is planning to inaugurate the DRC 
program in Ituri September 1st, serious obstacles remain. 
Militia leaders have expressed disappointment that none of 
them were included in a long list of military appointments 
and promotions recently enacted by the government. They have 
told MONUC that they feel that the GDRC has failed to follow 
through on its promises made earlier in the year in Kinshasa. 
Some of them now feel that they have less of an incentive to 
persuade their followers to participate in the disarmament 
program. 
 
7. (C) In Gerard\'s view, the massacre of Banyamulenge 
refugees in Burundi will make it more difficult to convince 
Hemas from the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) and from the 
Party for the Unity and Safeguarding of the Integrity of 
Congo (PUSIC) to participate in disarmament. Hemas have 
expressed an affinity for Tutsis and some of them have 
pointed to this massacre as evidence of what could happen to 
them if they gave up their arms. Lendus on the other hand, 
feel protected by the arrival of FARDC\'s first battalion 
(Note: The commander of this first FARDC battalion is part of 
the former government\'s army (FAC) who was viewed as 
pro-Lendu. The second and third battalions of this brigade 
are commanded by members of the Rally for Congolese 
Democracy-Goma (RCD-G) and the National Liberation Movement 
(MLC) respectively. End Note.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) MONUC has shifted its position on deployment of 
FARDC\'s integrated brigade to Ituri from initial opposition 
to cautious support. The first battalion deployed to Ituri 
has received the training necessary for the basic 
peace-keeping support operations it has been assigned as well 
as the necessary equipment. Additionally, MONUC has promised 
to guide them during this initial phase and help familiarize 
them with conditions in Ituri. The GDRC knows that the 
reputation of its armed forces rests on this brigade. If the 
government follows through on its promise to make regular 
salary payments to this initial contingent of its integrated 
brigade then there is reason for cautious optimism. This 
remains to be seen. The GDRC should also work to reassure the 
people of Ituri that FARDC\'s newly deployed integrated 
brigade will serve everyone in the district regardless of 
ethnicity.

SUBJECT: VP RUBERWA COULD BE BACK IN KINSHASA SOON, SAYS 
RCD OFFICIAL 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
SUMMARY:  A senior official from the RCD ex-rebel movement 
reports that transitional government vice-president Azarias 
Ruberwa might return to Kinshasa before President Mbeki\'s 
scheduled August 30 arrival.  This follows a public statement 
by members of the CIAT, encouraging Ruberwa and other RCD 
leaders to travel to Kinshasa and resume their participation 
in the transitional government, and a similar (albeit 
slightly inflammatory in parts) announcement by the 
government August 25.  Separately, a senior official of the 
MLC ex-rebel movement says that President Kabila has agreed 
to compromise on the issue of amnesty.  In our view, RCD 
leaders realize they have overplayed their hand and are 
looking for an exit.  The compromise on amnesty is a minor 
victory for the RCD (and a positive development) but Ruberwa 
is the big loser in this latest round.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
RCD Official Says Ruberwa to Return 
----------------------------------- 
2. (C) Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) member Christian 
Kambinga, who is vice-minister of international cooperation 
in the transitional government, told Ambassador August 25 
several RCD parliamentarians are leaving Goma for Kinshasa 
\"today,\" and RCD president Azarias Ruberwa (vice-president in 
the transitional government) could return to Kinshasa before 
the arrival of South African President Thabo Mbeki, scheduled 
for August 30.  He also asked the International Committee to 
Support the Transition (CIAT) to urge South African President 
Thabo Mbeki to join with them in mediating between the RCD 
and other members of the transitional government, a request 
Ambassador declined.  (Note:  Mbeki is scheduled to arrive in 
Kinshasa August 30, for what the S. African Embassy here 
calls \"routine government consultations,\" departing the next 
day.  End Note.) 
 
 
CIAT Chastises RCD 
------------------ 
3. (U) Members of the International Committee to Support the 
Transition (CIAT) issued a communique on August 24 which: 
--\"notes with regret\" certain RCD leaders\' decision to 
\"temporarily suspend their participation in transitional 
institutions\" 
--invites those same RCD members to \"immediately\" return to 
Kinshasa, the national capital 
--calls on all political leaders to promote dialogue and 
national reconciliation, and refrain from inflammatory speech 
or acts 
--reaffirms that there is no alternative to the transitional 
process, as enshrined by the Global, Inclusive Agreement and 
the constitution 
(Note:  Informal translation.  End Note.) 
 
Government Extends a Conditional Hand 
------------------------------------- 
4. (U)  At an August 25 briefing for the diplomatic community 
and selected press, the Foreign Ministry presented the 
government\'s official response to the Eastern situation, 
notably: 
 
-- called on VP Ruberwa to quickly return to Kinshasa and 
resume his official duties in support of the transition 
-- expressed \"surprise\" at his complaints, and at the 
location he chose to share his views 
-- recalled that Kinshasa is the seat of legitimate 
government of the DRC, whereas Goma was for many years \"one 
of the bases for the aggression perpetrated against our 
country\" 
-- pointed out that, during an end-year review of 
transitional progress conducted by the government, Ruberwa\'s 
security and political affairs committee declined to present 
a report (although all other VPs did provide such an 
evaluation), and that Ruberwa, along with others, voted to 
continue the transition in its present form and goals 
-- reiterated that the Congolese people demand elections, and 
the transitional government will continue its progress with 
the goal of ensuring fair, transparent and credible elections 
for the Congolese people. 
(Note:  Informal translation.  End Note.) 
 
 
Possible Compromise on Amnesty Issue 
------------------------------------ 
5. (C) Thomas Luhaka, Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) 
spokesman and the MLC\'s parliamentary group leader, told 
poloff August 25 that National Assembly president Olivier 
Kamitatu met with President Kabila on August 24, and agreed 
to a compromise on the draft amnesty law that parliament is 
currently debating.  (Comment:  This is a major shift for 
Kabila, whose supporters have been pushing hard to exclude 
individuals convicted by a military tribunal in 2003 of 
assassinating former president Laurent Kabila.  This has been 
a key issue for the RCD, many of whose leading supporters in 
the East were condemned during the trial.  End Comment.) 
According to Luhaka, Kabila has agreed for the National 
Assembly to simply adopt the language already contained in 
Kabila\'s own provisional amnesty decree of April 15, 2003, 
which gave amnesty for acts of war and political offenses 
committed between 1998 and 2003, without excluding the 
alleged assassins. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) RCD leaders, realizing they have overplayed their hand 
in recent days, are looking for an exit.  The compromise on 
amnesty is a minor victory for the RCD--and a positive 
development in our view.  Nonetheless, Ruberwa is the big 
loser in this latest round, caught between the hardliners and 
an apparent majority that refused to suspend their 
participation in the transitional government.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: REMOVAL OF ARTISANAL MINERS AROUND LIKASI - 
INCLUDING SHINKOLOBWE 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.5 b/d 
 
1. (U) Summary. The Governor of Katanga is currently on a 
campaign to move all artisanal miners in and around Likasi to 
special artisanal mining designated zones outside of Kolwezi. 
This move includes forcing the 6,000-10,000 miners out of 
Shinkolobwe. Possible rabble-rousing by former Katangan 
politicians could exacerbate an unhappy social climate. End 
Summary. 
 
MOVIN ON OUT, BUT NOT UP 
 
2. (C) The current Governor of Katanga Province, Kisula Ngoy, 
has issued an order for all artisanal miners in and around 
Likasi and Lubumbashi to be moved to special artisanal zones, 
designated by the Minister of Mines, outside of Kolwezi, 
which is the furthest mining town from Lubumbashi. Econoff 
spoke with the leader of the Shinkolobwe artisanal miners 
union who confirmed that the Governor ordered the FARDC 
(army), ANR (intelligence service) and Mining Police to 
remove the miners from Shinkolobwe and all other sites in the 
Likasi/Lubumbashi area. He stated that all the miners - 
approximately 40,000 to 50,000 - are now in Likasi and 
Lubumbashi without money or means of employment. The miners 
also had to abandon the villages they built near the mine 
sites. (Comment. It is uncertain who is currently guarding 
and/or working the mines. End Comment.) 
 
3. (SBU) Miners are extremely discontented about moving to 
the areas outside Kolwezi. They were happy where they were 
because the cobalt concentration is high and access to 
consumer goods is better due to the relatively decent 
condition of the highway from Likasi to Lubumbashi and South 
to the Zambian border. The continuation of the highway from 
Likasi to Kolwezi is in extremely poor condition. Transport 
of goods and people to Kolwezi itself is irregular, much less 
to areas outside of the main city. Additionally, the miners 
could sell heterogenite to a variety of buyers in Likasi and 
Lubumbashi, whereas, in Kolwezi, there are effectively only 
two buyers: Groupe Forrest and a Lebanese heterogenite dealer 
who goes by the name Alex Bazano. 
 
4. (SBU) On Aug 25, a large group of miners (over 1000) 
protested in front of the offices of the Governor of Katanga 
to protest the Mining Ministry requirement of ID cards for 
artisanal miners (at a cost of USD 150) and the expanding 
purchases of Gecamines concessions by George Forrest. The 
protest was peaceful. However, the miners intend to continue 
to protest until the governor gives a response to their 
claims. A financial officer for Groupe Forrest described the 
artisanal situation as disorder; and there is no one at the 
provincial level who wants to find a solution to the problem. 
 
POTENTIAL FOR RABBLE ROUSING BY KATANGAN EXTREMISTS 
 
5. (C) Three months ago USAID-Kinshasa met with a 
Katangan-based NGO which relayed a report stating that an 
organization named Katanga Force Vive (KFV), in 
representation of the Katangan community, was fed up with 
foreign control of the mining sector. In reaction they would 
occupy all foreign-owned mining concessions, or, at least, 
resist any efforts to remove artisanal miners from their 
current locations on parts of foreign-owned concessions. They 
claimed to intend to target specifically those concessions 
held under joint-venture between Gecamines and foreign 
individuals or companies. 
 
6. (C) The NGO transmitted a \"map\" produced by KFV detailing 
almost all mining concessions as being foreign-owned and 
commented that this map was being used to win artisanal 
miners\' support for KFV\'s political agenda. (Comment. USAID 
officer noted that the map was crudely drawn and did not 
clearly delineate which concessions were solely foreign-owned 
or subject to joint-ventures with Gecamines. Embassy is yet 
to view the map. End Comment.)  USAID mentioned that former 
Governor Kyungu as well as Moise Katumbi Chapwe (Provincial 
Director of the PPRD, director of Association pour la 
Sauvegarde des interets des operateur economique, and brother 
of Katebe Katoto) were listed as active supporters of the 
group. A foreign mining firm manager from Katanga confirmed 
that the miners did threaten to overrun foreign-held 
concessions. However, up to present, there have been no large 
scale occupations or violent conflicts between artisanal 
miners and mining firms. 
 
COMMENT 
 
7. (C) While it was unlikely a few months ago that concession 
occupations would take place, the enforcement of the Ministry 
of Mines decision to move the artisanal miners outside of 
Kolwezi could increase the possibility of local unrest and 
occupations. As noted above, protests have begun, however, it 
is uncertain how inclusive and influential these protests 
are. Katanga has been hit hard during the economic collapse. 
Comparatively, the standard of living in the copperbelt has 
dropped further than in other areas of the DRC due to the 
systematic pillage of Gecamines. The involvement of former 
Governor Kyungu and Moise Katumbi is not confirmed. However, 
Kyungu\'s involvement can only be detrimental to the already 
frayed social fabric of Katanga. 
8. (C) Unfortunately, the miners\' union leader commented to 
Econoff that the provincial authorities are telling miners 
that Shinkolobwe was ordered closed under strong pressure 
from the USG. Econoff commented to the labor leader that the 
GDRC took the decision to create artisanal zones and remove 
miners from their current concessions of its own accord. He 
also reiterated to the labor leader that the USG cannot force 
a sovereign government (GDRC) to do its bidding. It is 
uncertain whether a general anti-American sentiment is 
spreading in the lower-classes of Katanga. End Comment.

heterogenite mining operations on the Kalukuluku 
concession, which was abandoned by Gecamines in July 
2003.  The concession is situated on the Mine de 
l\'Etoile near Lubumbashi, and is estimated to hold 15 
million tons of ore.  Current heterogenite production 
is rated at 50-70 tons per day, but CHEMAF plans to 
increase production to 350 tons per day.  Local 
artisanal miners had occupied the concession since 
Gecamines\' departure.  (Note.  VP Bemba was moving to 
annul the contract signed by Gecamines, the Ministry of

DRC.  The deal requires GDRC approval before the 
transfer of the title can be completed, but Chevron- 
Texaco is no longer operating the concessions.  Perenco 
has been present in the DRC since 2000, and has already 
acquired onshore concessions in East Banana, Mibale, 
and Liawenda-Kinkasi.  Chevron-Texaco will maintain its 
presence in the DRC through its Kinshasa representative 
office. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
INGA PRIVATIZATION CONTROVERSY 
 
8. (U) DRC Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Mbwinga 
Bila was quoted in the press as stating that 
electricity parastatal SNEL was \"surprised\" and 
\"unhappy\" to hear that the South African firm Eskom had 
formed a consortium with the Industrial Development 
Corporation and SNC Lavalin of Canada to bid on the 
repair and expansion of the hydroelectric facilities at 
Inga I and Inga II.  Bila also stated that SNEL\'s 
unhappiness \"is justified by the fact that they are not 
a part of the consortium.\"  SNEL reportedly has an 
existing partnership with Eskom, though not one that 
would preclude Eskom from pursuing development projects 
in the DRC with other companies. 
 
CELTEL LAUNCHES INTERNATIONAL ROAMING SERVICE 
 
9. (U) Celtel, the second largest cellular operator in 
the DRC, has launched a new international roaming 
service after signing bilateral agreements with 
numerous foreign service providers.  Celtel customers 
will now have access to cellular networks in much of 
Europe, West Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. 
 
TRANSPORTATION 
 
BRIDGE REHABILITIATION TO BEGIN BY YEAR\'S END 
 
10. (U) Public Works Minister Jose Endundu announced 
that complete rehabilitations of the Mai-Ndombe and 
Kwango bridges on National Route No. 1 from Bandundu 
province to Kinshasa will begin by the end of 2004. 
The EU has agreed to finance the projects at a cost of 
900,000 Euros.  (Note.  Commercial traffic is currently 
using the recently repaired temporary Mai-Ndombe 
bridge, installed after the original bridge was 
destroyed during the civil war.  Upcoming work will 
rehabilitate the original bridge.  End Note.) 
 
LABOR 
 
MATADI PORT WORKERS THREATEN STRIKE 
 
11. (U) Local press reports that workers at the Port of 
Matadi are threatening to strike due to rumors that 
ONATRA (port authority) aims to build a road and rail 
bridge over the Congo River linking the DRC with Congo- 
Brazzaville.  The Port of Matadi has recently 
experienced a reduction in commerce due to low water 
levels on the Congo River.  Many ships have been 
diverted to Pointe-Noire, Congo-Brazzaville.  Port 
workers are demanding that money be allocated for 
proper dredging and channel marking along the river. 
(Comment.  Port workers are rightly worried that their 
jobs are in danger.  Operations at the port have been 
seriously encumbered by a lack of dredging in river 
channels over recent years.  However, construction of a 
bridge linking the DRC to Congo-Brazzaville would be 
fiscally impractical and would carry significant 
political baggage.  End Comment.)

SUBJECT:  GDRC WANTS TO CONTROL ACCESS TO IDPS 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  In a recent letter addressed to all 
humanitarian actors in DRC, the Minister of 
Solidarity and Humanitarian Affairs accused the 
international community of not respecting human 
rights, of distributing expired consumables, and of 
coercing IDPS to return home and then abandoning them 
midway.  The Minister is henceforth insisting that 
all organizations collaborate fully with her ministry 
before implementing any interventions, and 
specifically requiring that they seek and obtain an 
authorization from her office before even approaching 
any IDPs in any way. IDP return programs would 
furthermore be obliged from now on to cover all 
phases of this process, including transportation home 
and socio-economic assistance after arrival.  The 
Humanitarian Advocacy Group, which is the senior 
forum for humanitarian planning in DRC, will respond 
to the letter at this point only with a request for 
clarification on the accusations and for a chance to 
meet directly with the minister. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (U) On August 25, the Minister of Solidarity and 
Humanitarian Affairs, Mrs. Nzuzi wa Mbombo, released 
a letter addressed to \"all humanitarian actors\" in 
DRC in which she states that she has received reports 
that principles of international human rights have 
not been respected by the humanitarians, and that 
there have been, in fact, serious abuses committed in 
the name of humanitarian intervention. (Comment: 
Nzuzi represents the remnants of the MPR, Mobutu\'s 
former party.  End Comment.)  She also accused the 
international humanitarian community of distributing 
products whose expiration date had passed, and of 
\"intimidating\" IDPs to return when they were not yet 
ready, only to abandon them before they reached their 
destinations. 
 
3. (U) As a result, humanitarian agencies are now 
asked to respect the following three new rules: 
 
a. No agency may henceforth have access to IDPs in 
DRC without first obtaining an authorization from the 
Ministry of Solidarity and Humanitarian Affairs. 
 
b. All actions on behalf of IDPs in DRC must be fully 
planned prior to implementation in full collaboration 
with the Ministry of Solidarity and Humanitarian 
Affairs. 
 
c. Programs targeting the return of IDPs must 
guarantee coverage of all phases of this process, 
ranging from the provision of transportation to the 
delivery of post-return socio-economic recovery 
assistance. 
 
4. (U) The letter was discussed at the weekly meeting 
of the Humanitarian Advocacy Group on August 27, 
attended by OFDA and other donors as well as the 
heads of UN Agencies.  Group members decided to 
respond to the letter for now only by writing to ask 
for further clarification of the accusations and to 
request a meeting for UNOCHA leaders with the 
Minister herself. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (SBU) In general, the humanitarian community does 
not hold this new ministry or this particular 
minister in very high regard, and suspects the letter 
is just the latest in a series of attempts by Nzuzi 
to secure control over some humanitarian resources. 
END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: STATEMENTS BY CIAT AND THE GDRC ON THE RCD-G\'S 
DECISION TO SUSPEND PARTICIPATION IN THE TRANSITION 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1608 
 
1. (U) The CIAT and the GDRC issued statements concerning the 
Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma\'s (RCD-G) decision to 
suspend their participation in the institutions of the 
transitions, except the army. The following are unofficial 
translations of the statements issued by each entity: 
 
 
COMMUNIQUE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE 
TRANSITION (CIAT) 
 
 
1-     The CIAT expresses its sympathy with the feelings of 
pain and sorrow that afflict the Congolese people following 
the terrible massacre, which took place in Gatumba on August 
13, 2004. 
 
2-    Moreover, The CIAT has learned of the declaration made 
by the Congolese Rally for Democracy - RCD and notes with 
regret that some of those responsible for this entity have 
decided to temporally suspend their participation in the 
Transitional Institutions. 
 
 
3-    The CIAT immediately invites RCD members who have 
announced suspension of their participation in the 
Transitional Institutions to retake their respective 
positions in Kinshasa which is the headquarters of the 
country\'s institutions. 
 
4-    The CIAT calls on all transition officials and 
political leaders to encourage dialogue and national 
reconciliation through their actions and statements. It calls 
on everyone to abstain from speech or acts which may raise 
tensions or foment ethnic hatred. 
 
 
5-    The CIAT reiterates that there is no viable alternative 
to the transition process as laid down in the All Global and 
Inclusive Accord and the Constitution. The difficulties 
encountered must find their solutions within the transitional 
institutions and within the framework of mechanisms set to 
this effect. 
 
6-    The CIAT is composed of five permanent United Nations 
Security Council members (China, United States of America, 
France, the United Kingdom, Russia) Belgium, Canada, South 
Africa, Angola, Gabon, Zambia, the European Union, the 
African Union and MONUC

GOVERNMENT\'S COMMUNIQUE TO THE DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS IN 
KINSHASA IN RELATION TO THE RCD-G\'S DECISION TO SUSPEND ITS 
PARTICIPATION IN THE DRC TRANSITIONAL INSTITUTIONS 
 
Statement by Robert Mbwinga, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs 
 
To begin with, I would like to thank you on behalf of the 
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for having 
taken time from your numerous occupations to respond to our 
invitation. 
 
The government has asked me to organize this meeting to 
inform your excellencies on our position regarding the 
current path of the transition. 
 
The Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo was surprised about the declaration made in Goma on 
Tuesday August 24, 2004, by his Excellency Azarias Ruberwa, 
Vice-President in charge of the Political, Defense and 
Security Commission, in which he announced that the RCD-G was 
temporarily pulling out of the transitional institutions. We 
were surprised  not only about the place where the 
declaration was made, but also about its contents. In effect, 
Kinshasa, as the headquarters of the country\'s institutions 
would have been a more appropriate city to make the 
declaration than Goma. The latter is remembered as one of the 
cities where aggression was carried out against our country. 
 
As far as the contents of the Vice-President\'s declaration is 
concerned, the Government has noted that the RCD-G decision 
to temporarily suspend its participation in the transitional 
institutions may have been motivated by its claim  to 
evaluate the transition. It appears that the latter claim has 
been justified on account of the massacre of Congolese people 
 in the Gatumba refugee camp in Burundi. The government 
reminds everyone that, having denounced this repulsive act, 
it has called for the setting up of an independent 
international investigative commission to identify the 
authors of the massacre, establish responsibilities and bring 
them to justice. Before this takes place, the Vice-President 
should refrain from making any speculations or hasty 
declarations, because this matter is very serious and it 
should be treated with great caution. 
 
In any case, it is not secret to anyone that the transition 
process has witnessed several problems since its inception. 
The Government wants to stress that in all cases, solutions 
have been found in accordance with the Transitional 
Constitution and the All Global and Inclusive Accord, as well 
as within the transitional institutions. These mechanisms 
have thus far shown their efficiency and as such should not 
be ignored. No one should look for ways to bring the  country 
back to the starting point and imperil the gains already 
acquired as well as progress to set up the institutions of 
the Third Republic. There is no possibility of stopping the 
transition to evaluate and negotiate outside the institutions 
defined by the All Global and Inclusive Accord and the 
Transitional Constitution. 
 
As a reminder, at the end of the transition\'s first year, an 
evaluation was carried out by the government through which 
each commission was called on to report on their activities. 
Only the Economic and Financial Commission has presented its 
report, which was adopted by the Council of Ministers. The 
Commission on Political, Security and Defense Matters, 
presided over by Vice-President Ruberwa is currently 
examining reports by ministries under its jurisdiction before 
presentation to the Council of Ministers. What evaluation 
then does the RCD need? 
 
Each of you has to remember that at the beginning of this 
year, the President of the DRC held consultations with all 
components and entities of the transitional government on 
whether to revise the All Global and Inclusive Accord and the 
Constitution. All have unanimously called for the 
continuation of the transition under its current form. Along 
the same lines, the presidents of the Senate, the National 
Assembly and the institutions of support for democracy, 
expressed their continued support for the transition during a 
meeting with the President. I would like to call on all of 
you Ambassadors and Chiefs of Diplomatic Missions to act as 
interlocutors with your governments and to covey to your 
governments the firm desire of the Congolese people to pursue 
the transitional period without stops until the organization 
of free and transparent elections. 
 
As far as the government is concerned, it will continue to do 
everything it can in this regard. Additionally, all relevant 
ministries have been instructed to take all necessary steps 
to maintain peace and security for the population and 
citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Ministry of 
Defense has been specifically charged with safeguarding the 
apolitical nature of the army who should leave to political 
actors the responsibility of addressing the current situation. 
 
With regard to politicians and political parties, its is 
recommended that they avoid all statements that can further 
aggravate the situation and place the transition in peril. We 
call on them to work with the government to find a positive 
and prompt conclusion to this situation. 
 
The government cannot leave out the opportunity to commend 
the courage of all the RCD members who, on account of their 
patriotic duty, have decided to remain in Kinshasa and 
continue their participation in the transition institutions. 
 
Finally, the Government reiterates its recognition to the 
international community for the laudable and incessant 
efforts it has displayed for the success of the transition 
and calls on its vital role to ensure that the RCD comes to 
its senses and retakes its participation in the institutions 
of the republic.

SUBJECT: ECONOMIC REPORT - AUG 28 THROUGH SEPT 3 
 
 
1. Summary.  Prices are stable with the exception of 
food items, which registered a 7 percent increase. 
Exchange rates remain stable.  Adastra Minerals is 
seeking to become a major metals producer in the 
region.  Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC) and Gecamines 
are in advanced negotiations for a joint nickel 
production venture.  The GDRC signed memoranda of 
understanding with the governments of both Zimbabwe and 
South Africa.  The ICRC provided new pumps to Regideso 
in Kisangani to ensure a supply of running water for 
the city.  The World Bank has approved the release of 
USD 60 million for infrastructure and socio-economic 
capacity building projects throughout the DRC. 
 
MONETARY AND PRICE UPDATE 
 
2. Prices remain stable aside from a significant 
increase in food costs, which rose 7 percent for the 
week ending on August 27.  The cost increase may be due 
to merchant price gouging in attempts to cover school 
fees for the upcoming academic year.  School fees 
typically strain the budget of the average Congolese 
household. 
 
3. Exchange rates remain stable with bank rates 
hovering at over FC 390 to 1 USD.  Parallel market 
rates remain within an FC 5 band above or below the 
official rate.  Rates in the eastern provinces remain 
slightly elevated. 
 
MINING 
 
ADASTRA SEEKS TO EXPAND OPERATIONS, SIGNS WITH UMICORE 
 
4. International press reported Adastra Minerals (aka 
America Mineral Fields) COO Bernard Pryor as stating 
that the company is seeking to become a major metals 
producer in the region.  The company has already signed 
a joint venture agreement with Gecamines for a 
copper/cobalt tailings project at Kolwezi, and recently 
awarded the contract for the project feasibility study. 
Adastra also reported that it has signed a long-term 
supply agreement under which Umicore will purchase 
cobalt to be produced from the Kolwezi project. 
Additionally, Adastra is involved in a joint venture 
with Gecamines to resume activity at the DRC\'s Kipushi 
zinc mine, which has been closed for a decade but could 
be operational again by 2006.  Adastra intends to 
extract zinc from Kipushi for processing in South 
Africa. 
 
BNC AND GECAMINES IN ADVANCED NEGOTIATIONS 
 
5. International press reported that Bindura Nickel 
Corporation (BNC) chairman Kalaa Mpinga said his firm 
is finalizing a joint venture agreement with Gecamines 
for a nickel production project in the DRC.  BNC was 
acquired last year by Mwana Africa Holdings and is 
listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. 
 
FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
 
ZIMTRADE ABANDONS WAREHOUSE PROJECT 
 
6. Local press reported that Zimtrade, Zimbabwe\'s 
struggling parastatal trade promotion body, has 
abandoned its plans to construct warehousing facilities 
for Zimbabwean companies in the DRC.  Several 
Zimbabwean business ventures will reportedly be 
jeopardized by the project\'s cancellation. 
 
ECONOMIC COOPERATION 
 
DRC AND ZIMBABWE SIGN MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING 
 
7. International press reported that the DRC and Zambia 
have signed several memoranda of understanding relating 
to commerce, energy, and mining.  DRC Minister of 
Regional Cooperation Mbusa Nyamwisi signed the 
agreements with Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan 
Mudenge.  Specifically, the memoranda are intended to 
improve road transportation between the two countries, 
harmonize their mineral exploration operations, and 
resolve a dispute over electrical power sold to 
Zimbabwe by DRC energy parastatal SNEL. 
 
DRC AND SOUTH AFRICA TO INCREASE COOPERATION 
 
8. As part of South African President Thabo Mbeki\'s 
attempts to safeguard the transition process in the 
DRC, delegates from the two countries met during 
Mbeki\'s recent DRC visit to discuss matters of economic 
cooperation.  Press reported that the meetings resulted 
in the signing of an agreement on health matters, a 
memorandum of understanding on economic cooperation, 
and an agreement for the reciprocal protection and 
promotion of investment. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
ICRC PROVIDES PUMPS TO REGIDESO IN KISANGANI 
9. The ICRC has delivered ten pump units to Regideso in 
Kisangani to replace failing pumps installed in 1982. 
The pumps will be used to filter and chemically treat 
Kisangani\'s water supply.  Installation of the pumps 
will boost Regideso capacity and allow it to supply 
nearly all of Kisangani\'s 600,000 residents with 
running water. 
AID 
 
WORLD BANK APPROVES USD 60 MILLION GRANT 
 
10. The World Bank approved the release of USD 60 
million to aid demobilization, social capital building, 
and infrastructure-related projects in the DRC.  The 
money will be distributed to provincial and local 
government agencies and NGOs.

SUBJECT: EMBASSY KINSHASA RESPONSE TO \"DEVELOPING A 
COMMERCIAL PLATFORM AT NON-FCS POSTS\" 
 
REF: STATE 174107 
 
1. Summary. Embassy Kinshasa appreciates the opportunity to 
respond to reftel requesting comments and suggestions on 
developing a commercial platform at non-FCS posts. The 
Democratic Republic of Congo is currently emerging from a 
decade of economic distress, and commercial activity is 
slowly restarting. Hence, Embassy Kinshasa is in a unique 
position to implement changes in collaboration with FCS. 
Post\'s current situation is characterized by ad hoc contact 
with its regional FCS representative to respond to 
trade/business inquiries and FCS requests. Planning will be 
important due to the renascent nature of the commercial 
portfolio at Post. Embassy Kinshasa does not currently have a 
well coordinated business facilitation program beyond BuyUSA, 
Gold Key, and case-by-case replies to trade and investment 
inquiries. End Summary. 
 
ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT SITUATION 
 
2. The commercial portfolio at Embassy Kinshasa is currently 
shared between two FSOs and one FSN. The FSN has primary 
responsibility for daily maintenance of the portfolio and 
contact with FCS-Nairobi. At present, the primary services 
requested from Embassy Kinshasa are supplier or distributor 
searches, operational business information for the DRC, 
business advocacy (e.g. intervening in investment disputes or 
conflicts with elements of the GDRC), supporting the 
infrequent trade delegations (usually led by the Corporate 
Council on Africa), and occassionally, formal DoC programs 
such as BuyUSA and Gold Key. Embassy has previously used BFIF 
funds to actualize BuyUSA informational programs and other 
trade related activities. Post is also currently beginning to 
work closely with OPIC to obtain GDRC agreement for several 
political risk insurance applications. Embassy Kinshasa hopes 
that regularization of work with the GDRC on investment 
related issues such as OPIC will help to facilitate further 
investment dialogue and re-acclamate the GDRC to Western 
business practices. 
 
3. Resource allocation is currently not a serious issue at 
Post due to the limited activities of the commercial 
portfolio. However, Embassy Kinshasa is concerned that those 
funds which are available are not adequately used due to lack 
of information. Post FSN commented that an account dedicated 
to commercial activities for Embassy Kinshasa exists at 
FCS-Nairobi, however, Post\'s access to information about this 
account is limited. These funds could be used for trade 
promotion or business education activities in the DRC. 
 
4. Training opportunities for FSOs and FSNs conducted at the 
regional level would be of interest. The economic section of 
Embassy Kinshasa has a section chief and two first-tour 
officers as direct-hire Americans. The section chief and one 
first-tour officer manage the commercial portfolio with one 
of three FSNs. Educational opportunities regarding the 
functioning of the FCS and/or DoC programs would be of great 
utility. Access to and training for DoC databases and 
intranet would aid in research and program development. 
 
5. Increased cross-agency consultation is important to 
Embassy Kinshasa. A reliable link to DoC databases and 
FCS-Nairobi would assist in quickly and reliably responding 
to commercial inquiries. Embassy Kinshasa does not have 
access to either the \"Business Facilitation Instant Messaging 
System\" or DoC databases. Access to either of those channels 
and/or the creation of a Francophone interlocutor at 
FCS-Nairobi would be of great assistance. 
 
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PLANNING PROCESSES 
 
6. Embassy Kinshasa currently has comments on operational 
level planning. Of key importance to Post is the availability 
of an FCS interlocutor who is fluent in French and 
understands Francophone business practices. Post\'s commercial 
FSN commented that when FCS-Abidjan was responsible for 
Kinshasa, collaboration was significantly easier because of 
the absence of linguistic challenges and due to the better 
understanding of the Francophone Africa business environment. 
Either the addition of a Francophone interlocutor at 
FCS-Nairobi or a relocation of Kinshasa in regional 
responsibilities would be helpful. 
 
7. Regional planning and objectives: Post would be interested 
in an annual regional forum for commercial program planning 
that would include members of economic sections at non-FCS 
posts. This would facilitate communication and help reorient 
Posts\' commercial programs to overarching policy goals. 
 
BUSINESS FACILITATION PROGRAMS 
 
8. Post is currently analysing the development of a 
commercial platform to adapt to the changing economic 
environment in the DRC. The economic section is currently 
testing the development of monthly sector reporting and of an 
electronic business database to facilitate responses to trade 
inquiries. Occasional instructions or training from FCS 
sector and program specialist would aid in providing improved 
market research and service delivery. This will help Post 
reach beyond case-by-case reporting and occassional program 
activities.

SUBJECT: DRC NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR GREAT LAKES CONFERENCE 
UPDATE 
 
1. (U) Summary. The DRC\'s National Coordinator for the Great 
Lakes Conference (GLC) states that initial contacts with 
civil society groups around the country show that the top 
priority for most people is peace and security. Congolese 
citizens have expressed serious concerns about territorial 
integrity and the insecurity posed by armed groups and unpaid 
soldiers. The DRC is preparing to participate at an upcoming 
regional meeting of national coordinators to the GLC in 
Bujumbura September 6-10, in which members will discuss 
national priorities and the GLC\'s proposed agenda. End 
Summary. 
 
National Committee Working on DRC\'s Agenda 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Poloff met with the DRC\'s National Coordinator for the 
GLC, Baudouin Hamuli, September 1st, to discuss preparations 
for this regional event currently scheduled for mid-November 
2004. The four major themes that the GLC is planning to 
address are peace and security, good governance and 
democracy, economic development and regional integration, and 
humanitarian and social questions. The United Nations, the 
European Union, the African Union, Canada and The Netherlands 
are supporting this event and will be sending observers to 
the conference. 
 
3. (U) According to Hamuli, the DRC\'s national commission has 
been working with civil society groups from around the 
country to get their input on what ought to be the priorities 
for the Congo at the GLC. Although their work is ongoing, the 
current consensus is that the country should focus on peace 
and security issues. Ensuring the country\'s territorial 
integrity and preventing a conflict with Rwanda is the top 
security concern. Two other important security concerns 
expressed are addressing the problem of armed groups in Ituri 
and the Kivus, as well as the threats posed by unpaid 
soldiers and the lack of a unified national army. 
 
 
DRC to Participate at Upcoming Regional Meeting in Bujumbura 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
4. (U) Hamuli indicated that the DRC will attend the upcoming 
meeting of national coordinators for the GLC in Bujumbura, 
September 6-10. This will be the first regional meeting in 
which each participating country will discuss its national 
priorities with the goal of formulating a common agenda for 
the conference. Hamuli noted that although the DRC had not 
yet reached a consensus about its national agenda, it was 
nonetheless prepared to discuss its preliminary findings. He 
hopes that the DRC will be able to present its final agenda 
by the next regional meeting, scheduled to take place in 
Kinshasa in October. 
 
5. (U) Hamuli explained that the current core members for the 
GLC include Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, 
and the DRC. He said that all core members except Rwanda and 
Uganda had also agreed to include Angola and the Republic of 
Congo as additional core members. The Netherlands and Canada 
are the principal financial sponsors of this regional event. 
Although Hamuli expressed a desire for greater U.S. support 
for the conference, poloff reiterated post\'s previously 
stated concerns over the vast scope of this conference and 
the lack of a concise agenda. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (U) Although the concept of a regional Great Lakes 
conference to deal with peace, security, and economic 
development issues is a positive initiative, legitimate 
concerns remain over the wide range of topics the forum seeks 
to cover. As suggested by initial feedback from civil society 
groups, peace and security remain the main concerns for the 
Congolese. The GDRC should attempt to use the limited time 
left before the scheduled November GLC to focus on concrete 
and realistic goals that can help improve national and 
regional security.

SUBJECT: ITURI ARMED GROUP RELEASES KIDNAPPED PEACEKEEPER 
IN BUNIA 
 
Classified By: Poloff Gons Nachman for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary. On September 6th at approximately 11 PM, the 
Union of Congolese Patriots Lubanga faction (UPC-L) released 
a Moroccan peacekeeper whom they had kidnapped September 2nd. 
The security situation in Bunia deteriorated significantly as 
armed Hema and Lendu militias openly patrolled the streets of 
Bunia without any apparent reaction from MONUC or FARDC\'s 
integrated brigade. MONUC has indicated that it soon will 
take action to restore stability in the city. The militias 
have also expressed unhappiness with the Ituri demobilization 
program and the lack of military integration. Elsewhere in 
Ituri District, Jerome and FNI clashed, leading to some 
renewed internal displacements. End Summary. 
 
UPC Releases kidnapped Moroccan Peacekeeper in Bunia 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (C) According to MONUC senior poloff Gerold Gerard, a 
Moroccan peacekeeper in Bunia was kidnapped by members of the 
UPC-L September 2nd at approximately 10 AM, as he visited the 
market in the Mudzipela neighborhood of Bunia. MONUC and GDRC 
officials exerted pressure on UPC\'s leader, Thomas Lubanga, 
and engaged in prolonged negotiations with UPC elements in 
Bunia until the peacekeeper was finally released September 6, 
at approximately 11 PM. UPC had demanded the release of UPC 
prisoners under MONUC custody as well as a motorcycle that 
had been confiscated. MONUC did not release any UPC 
prisoners, but did return the confiscated motorcycle 
apparently to facilitate the release of the captive 
peacekeeper. Gerold noted that MONUC will implement cordon 
and search operations to seize weapons in Bunia and improve 
security within the next several days. 
 
 
Situation in Bunia Volatile 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (C) NGO and MONUC sources in Bunia said that the 
kidnapping of the peacekeeper resulted in a marked 
deterioration of the security situation in Bunia. September 
4th and 5th found armed UPC-L and Lendu militias returning to 
various neighborhoods, especially Mudzipela, Saio, and 
Nyakasanca. On September 5, a former UPC-Lubanga commander, 
Garuwa Garuwa, who had defected to UPC-Kisembo, was 
assassinated, reportedly by UPC-L militia. Persistent gun 
fire was heard throughout the weekend from militias who 
openly defied MONUC\'s weapons ban in Bunia. 
 
4. (C) Marcus Sack, Director of the German NGO Agro Action 
Allemand in Bunia told poloff September 5 that he was 
concerned by the militias\' open defiance of MONUC during the 
weekend. He said that MONUC had not done anything to enforce 
the weapons ban, bring back order to the city, and expel the 
armed militias. He also complained that MONUC\'s Bunia 
director, Dominique McAdams, had very poor communication with 
the NGO community and was perceived as taking a \"soft\" 
approach towards the UPC. 
 
5. (C) Sack also voiced concern about reported meetings 
between Lendu elements from the Front for National 
Integration (FNI) and the integrated Congolese Armed Forces 
battalion in Ituri (FARDC) the afternoon of September 5. 
Lendus have felt reassured by the presence of FARDC soldiers, 
whereas Hemas have viewed these soldiers with distrust. In 
Sack\'s view, Lendus will not tolerate a significant armed 
escalation by UPC militias and could possibly confront them 
with assistance from FARDC. 
 
Other Problems in Ituri 
----------------------- 
 
6. (U) Fighting erupted on August 31, between Popular Armed 
Forces of the Congo (FAPC) and FNI militias in Djalasiga (102 
KM north of Mahagi.) NGO sources in Bunia said that after 
several days of fighting, FAPC suffered a defeat which forced 
them to withdraw to 35 KM from Djalasiga. There are 13 
unconfirmed military fatalities, but no indication of 
civilian casualties. An unknown number of civilians have been 
displaced towards Kerekere and Aru. The current situation in 
Djalasiga is calm, but tense. 
 
7. (C) Vice-Minister of Interior Paul Musafiri, told poloff 
September 2nd, that he was concerned about the presence of 
Sudanese armed elements near Aru and the possibility of 
Sudanese People\'s Liberation Army (SPLA) recycling weapons in 
Ituri during coming months, as the peace process in Sudan 
frees up military equipment. He acknowledged that the GDRC 
does not have the means to patrol the northern part of Ituri 
and that the remaining battalions of FARDC\'s first integrated 
brigade would not be deployed for some time, due to lack of 
equipment. 
 
8. (C) Musafiri also voiced concern over the movement of 
Mbuza Nyamwisi\'s Congolese Popular Army (APC) forces from 
Beni to Mambaza. He said that although Nyamwisi is part of 
the transition government, his forces are not yet integrated 
into the national army and their deployment to Ituri at this 
point was inappropriate and could increase tensions. Musafiri 
also acknowledged that Jerome Kakawe, leader of the FAPC, was 
paying the salary of the Aru territory administrator and that 
he has de facto control of Aru, but said that there was not 
much the GDRC could do at this point. 
 
9. (C) Ituri militia leaders such as Jerome have expressed 
disappointment that neither they nor their officers have been 
integrated into the Congolese army. They have also voiced 
skepticism about the disarmament and demobilization of their 
forces without the option of integrating them into a national 
army. GDRC officials have said repeatedly that the government 
does not currently have the resources to integrate these 
combatants and that this issue will have to be addressed 
later. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) The release of the Moroccan peacekeeper by the UPC-L 
is a welcome end to the kidnapping incident. However, UPC-L 
militias continue to challenge MONUC over the past several 
days in Bunia by openly displaying their weapons while 
patrolling streets in what is supposed to be a \"weapons-free\" 
city. MONUC\'s apparent unresponsiveness to militia 
provocations in Bunia over the weekend may have reflected 
concern that confrontations could have impeded or derailed 
negotiations for the release of the peacekeeper. However, 
they will probably have to reassert their authority before 
the situation further deteriorates by pressing the militias 
to leave Bunia and abide by the engagement act that they 
signed in Kinshasa May 14, agreeing to disarm and refrain 
from further armed conflict. The GDRC also needs to play a 
greater role in controlling armed groups and re-establishing 
effective authority in Ituri; paying the salaries of the 
district commissioner and of the territory administrators 
would be a good start.

SUBJECT: PROGRESS ON JVM KEY FOR DRC 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  DRC President Kabila told DAS Don Yamamoto, 
NSC Senior Advisor Cindy Courville and Central African 
Director Al Eastham that he would like to see the proposed 
Joint Verification Mission (JVM) operational before signing 
the trilateral agreement on the margins of the UNGA in New 
York.  Despite this declaration, the JVM seems unlikely to be 
functional that quickly, in part due to Congo\'s delay in 
selecting its team members.  End Summary. 
 
Background 
 
2. (C)  Following the successful third meeting of the 
U.S.-facilitated trilateral talks in Kampala August 24-25, 
bringing together FonMins and senior officials from Rwanda, 
Uganda and the DRC, U.S. particpants Yamamoto, Courville, and 
Eastham visited Kinshasa August 26.  Due to the RCD\'s 
temporary suspension of participation in the transistion, VP 
Ruberwa was unavailable; likewise, VP Bemba was on travel 
outside the Congo.  The team did, however, meet with 
President Kabila and several senior advisors, including 
FonMin Ramazani, National Security Advisor Samba Kaputo, 
Presidential Advisor Andre Kapanga, and Congolese Ambassador 
to the U.S. Mitifu, the Congolese delegation to the Kampala 
discussions. 
 
JVM \"Life or Death\" for DRC 
 
3. (C)  President Kabila began by summarizing the various 
peace initiatives between Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC since 
1999, and their varying success.  In his view, after much 
work some progress has been made on improving bilateral 
relations with Uganda, and many of the elements in the 
various peace accords applying to Uganda have been mostly 
met.  In particular, he noted that the DRC already has in 
place a border-patrol and confidence-building measure with 
Uganda similiar to the proposed JVM with Rwanda.  Almost in 
passing he noted that Congolese-Burundian relations have 
proceeded on a different track, because Burundi is a \"special 
case,\" but added, almost musingly, that particularly the 
Gatumba massacre suggests that perhaps Burundi should be 
included in the trilateral talks in the future. 
 
4. (C)  Regarding Rwanda, however, wounds are deep and slow 
to heal, especially when inflammed by mutual recriminations 
regarding Rwandan military presence in the DRC and alleged 
DRC support to the Interahamwe still present in Eastern 
Congo.  Repairing this relationship can only be managed by 
practical increments, Kabila said, noting that in his view, a 
functional JVM is critical to ensuring that the trilateral 
agreement is not merely another empty piece of paper signed 
with good intentions.  In fact, he said, the JVM is a life or 
death issue for the Congo, which is why the DRC must continue 
to insist that it be implemented immediately. 
 
5. (C)  Once this mechanism is in place, he said, he can 
foresee the Ministerial Commission referred to in the 
trilateral agreement meeting to discuss practical next steps 
in improving relations, including, ultimately, reopening 
embassies in Kinshasa and Kigali, respectively.  Kabila 
endorsed UN SecGen Koffi Annan\'s vision (expressed in an 
August 16 letter to the Presidents of the three countries) of 
the JVM being effective by September 6.  (Comment:  As NSC 
Courville noted in a later meeting with SRSG Swing, such an 
early implementation date seemed unrealistic, given that 
neither Rwanda nor the DRC had named their teams or reached 
agreement on the terms of reference for the JVM -- still an 
outstanding question.  End Comment.) 
 
6. (C)  Kabila concluded by reiterating that he wants to sign 
a practical document in New York, and doing so will require a 
fully functional JVM.  To that end he said he is willing to 
sit down in New York with Museveni and Kagame, with documents 
and notes on the table, and \"reason together.\"  (Comment: 
PolCouns asked Kapanga after the meeting whether this meant, 
as it seemed, that the President would be personally willing 
to finalize negotiation of the terms of reference of the JVM, 
if it had not been completed.  Kapanga cautiously said that 
he thought that might indeed be what Kabila meant.  End 
Comment.) 
 
A Window of Opportunity 
 
7. (C)  In a meeting later the same day with SRSG Swing, NSC 
Courville asked for further information regarding Annan\'s 
letter.  Swing confirmed that the letter had been sent and 
that, so far, he had not received any reply from the 
Congolese.  When pressed by Courville as to how the exchange 
of letters was meant to rapidly finalize the JVM, especially 
with key issues of the terms of reference still outstanding, 
Swing seemed almost as uncertain as we.  Courville stressed 
that the U.S. does not want to usurp the UN initiative, but 
noted that if a need arose for technical opinions on aspects 
of the JVM, appropriate U.S. agencies would be prepared to 
assist.  She also stressed that there seems to be a narrow 
window of opportunity in which the UN can successfully move 
the JVM to closure, which might require personal negotiations 
rather than simple exchanges of letters. 
 
Comment 
8. (C)  Despite Kabila\'s apparent commitment to quickly 
finalizing the JVM, the Congolese have not yet finished 
selecting their team members.  The initial list, drawn up in 
response to Annan\'s letter, was rejected by Samba Kaputo as 
not sufficiently representative of the \"componant\" balance 
within the transition, and so another list is currently being 
developed.  The Congolese also appear poised to object to at 
least one of the suggested Rwandan changes to the terms of 
reference of the JVM -- and issue which almost certainly will 
have to be worked out during face-to-face negotiations.

SUBJECT: COVERAGE OF NATIONALITY LAW SHOWS WEAKNESS OF 
CONGOLESE MEDIA 
 
1. (U) Summary. The Congolese media\'s coverage of draft 
nationality and amnesty laws has shown the limits of entities 
that lack independence, resources, and professionalism. The 
directors of Tropicana Television, and the more reputable 
daily newspapers La Referance Plus and Le Potentiel, 
acknowledge the weaknesses of the Congolese media and 
indicate that poverty, lack of professional training of 
journalists, fear of controversy, manipulation by extremists, 
and interference by media owners, political patrons and the 
government, account for the absence of a real debate on the 
issues of nationality and amnesty. Meanwhile, anti-Tutsi 
rhetoric continues to surface sporadically on television talk 
shows, newspapers, and workshops on nationality organized by 
NGOs.   End Summary. 
 
 
Lack of Resources and Independence Limits Media Coverage 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. (SBU) On August 16, Poloff met with Kibambe Tshintwa, the 
Director of Tropicana Television, and owner of Numerica, a 
privately owned television station and daily newspaper, 
respectively, to discuss media coverage of a draft 
nationality law currently being considered by Parliament. 
Tshintwa acknowledged the serious shortcomings of the 
 
SIPDIS 
Congolese media and said that it was difficult to provide 
good coverage of important issues such as the nationality 
law. In his view, the main problem is poverty. Congolese 
journalists are not always paid and when they are paid, their 
salaries are very low. When a journalist is sent to cover a 
story, he will give preference to whomever pays. 
Additionally, journalists are easily intimidated to either 
cover or refrain from covering stories. 
 
3. (SBU) Tshimwa said that there are too many television 
stations and daily newspapers in Kinshasa and not enough 
advertising to make ends meet. Some media outlets are owned 
by individuals who have direct ties to political figures with 
particular agendas and others make themselves available to 
those who can pay for access. Very few have the necessary 
resources to remain independent and to strive for objective 
coverage of events and issues. Lack of resources also affects 
professional training of journalists as many people simply 
start working for media outlets without any prior academic 
background. 
 
4. (SBU) According to Tshimwa, in the politically charged and 
polarized environment of the Congo, it is difficult to be 
seen as neutral. He said that ever since the 
Mobutu-Tshisekedi media split of 1990, when each leader 
supported different media entities, most people have come to 
distrust the media and to assume that each outlet represents 
a particular interest. Thsimwa indicated that when he 
interviews Vice-President Ruberwa, supporters of President 
Kabila accuse him of having been \"bought\" by Ruberwa. 
 
5. (SBU) Thsimwa noted that people are afraid to discuss 
sensitive issues like nationality or amnesty in an honest or 
open manner that could be seen as pro-Banyamulenge. Although 
Tshimwa claims that his television station tries to maintain 
 
SIPDIS 
a balanced approach on the nationality law, he could not 
point to any examples of guests on his programs who have 
advocated a generous and \"modern\" approach to nationality. At 
a personal level, he said that he agreed with new laws that 
would bring peace and organization to the DRC, including a 
nationality law that would be inclusive. Thsimwa said that 
there is no official censorship of the media, but that people 
practice \"self-censorship\" according to perceived interests. 
The National Congolese Radio and Television (RTNC) is an 
example of a television station where programs such as \"The 
Media Forum\" invite guests who share the same pro-government 
views to debate issues like nationality, thus avoiding any 
controversy. 
 
Editor of La Reference Plus: Not Enough Debate 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (SBU) Poloff met August 17 with Ipakala Mobiko, the 
director of the Kinshasa daily newspaper La Reference Plus, 
to discuss newspaper coverage of draft nationality and 
amnesty laws. Mobiko said the media reflects the disorganized 
state of society in the Congo. He noted that instead of a 
real debate within society or the media the voices that are 
often heard are those of extremists. 
 
7. (SBU) Mobiko claimed he has tried to publish balanced 
articles on nationality that call for reflection, maturity 
and inclusion. As an example, he referred to an article 
published by his newspaper on August 9th, in which the 
government was criticized for its approach to nationality. 
(Note: The article in question does in fact call for a more 
realistic approach to dual nationality, for the integration 
of immigrants and for the education of the Congolese public 
to address xenophobic attitudes. End Note.) However, he 
acknowledged that there are very few credible newspapers in 
the country and that most lack the independence needed to 
truly inform the public and generate healthy debates on key 
issues like nationality. 
 
8. (SBU) According to Mobiko, newspapers are a better medium 
to address issues in greater depth than either television or 
radio. However, he acknowledged that they are beyond the 
financial means of most Congolese. (Note: La Reference Plus 
costs USD 0.70 in Kinshasa and USD 0.85 in the provinces. End 
Note.) Mobiko noted that his newspaper circulates in major 
cities throughout the Congo, but delivery is contingent on 
flights, which are not always reliable. One creative way in 
which Congolese do access newspapers is by reading them while 
displayed in street corners or by making photocopies of 
interesting articles and circulating these copies. 
Editor of Le Potentiel: Journalists are Manipulated 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
9. (SBU) On August 26, Poloff met with Modest Mutinga, 
director of the daily newspaper Le Potentiel, and President 
of the High Media Authority (Note: This is a civilian entity 
created under the peace accords to serve as \"referee\" on 
media independence, particularly with respect to the 
electoral process. End Note.) Le Potentiel, and La Reference 
Plus are perhaps the most reputable newspapers in Kinshasa. 
However, there are over twenty other daily newspapers that 
are distributed around the city and most are unreliable and 
lack serious content. 
 
10. (SBU) According to Mutinga, the public media in the Congo 
has always existed to serve the power structure. Although in 
theory the media have now been liberalized, in reality little 
has changed. In his view, the Ministry of Information still 
does not understand that it should not interfere with the 
editorial line of public media. The private and commercial 
media\'s editorial lines are usually imposed by businessmen 
with political interests or by politicians. Thus in most 
cases, independence is severely compromised by financial and 
political dependence. 
 
11. (SBU) Mutinga said that the Congolese media was ill 
prepared to educate and sensitize the public about issues 
such as nationality and amnesty. In his view, the nationality 
question had already been addressed by the Lusaka Accords and 
the overall objective was peace and reconciliation. However, 
this view is not shared by others, especially people from 
eastern cities such as Bukavu, whose passionate views have 
been prominently featured in the media. (Note: Civil society 
members from Bukavu and Kisangani who discuss nationality 
issues have expressed strong distrust of Congolese Tutsis 
whom they typically referred to as \"Rwandans\". End Note.) In 
terms of the amnesty law, Mutinga noted the media was 
reluctant to deal with this very controversial issue, because 
it involves people sentenced in the assassination of the 
current president\'s father. 
 
Hard-liners Dominate Debate 
-------------------------- 
 
12. (U) During the month of August, Poloff participated in 
two workshops that addressed the nationality issue. One was 
organized by Journalists in Danger (JED) and the other by the 
National Democratic Institute (NDI) and Global Rights. During 
both fora, journalists and civil society representatives who 
expressed xenophobic attitudes towards Tutsis spoke freely 
and openly and comprised the majority of those who made 
public statements. The few individuals who called for a more 
tolerant and inclusive approach were immediately interrupted 
and criticized. A woman at the NDI workshop who openly 
challenged the notion that under Rwandan law, Congolese 
Tutsis could not acquire Congolese citizenship, was booed and 
later told poloff she had been threatened by one of the 
participants. Jackie Bisimwa, a member of parliament from the 
political opposition sitting behind poloff, kept interrupting 
the woman loudly saying \"We are not in Rwanda; let them go

Comment 
------- 
 
13. (U) At a private level, the directors of some of the most 
reputable media outlets in Kinshasa acknowledged candidly the 
serious shortcomings of the Congolese media and the lack of a 
real debate on the proposed draft nationality and amnesty 
laws. In an increasingly intolerant climate, in which a 
recent article in The Economist estimated 80% of Congolese 
think that Tutsis are not Congolese, it is very unlikely that 
most media entities would publish or broadcast the views of 
those calling for nationality and amnesty laws that are 
\"modern\", moderate, and generous. Instead, under the cover of 
\"patriotism\", the Congolese public has been presented with a 
vast array of television guests and newspaper articles 
referring to the danger posed by Rwanda, questioning the 
loyalty of Congolese Tutsis, and asserting that Banyamulenges 
constitute a threat.

REF: A. KINSHASA 1547 
     B. KINSHASA 1384 
 
1. Summary.  Infrastructural damage suffered over years of 
war and neglect have all but crippled the DRC\'s land 
transportation network.  Roads and railways are critical to 
the country\'s recovery, but have received little attention 
from the GDRC.  International financing for rehabilitation 
projects is helpful but shortsighted.  Without revenue 
generating mechanisms in place to fund long-term upkeep, aid 
money is squandered on repairs that will quickly deteriorate. 
  End Summary. 
 
Road Assessment 
--------------- 
 
2. Responsibility for construction, management, and 
maintenance of the DRC\'s roads falls primarily with the 
Ministry of Transportation\'s Office des Routes (OR - Roads 
Administration).  The country\'s road network is comprised of 
152,230 km of roads of which 7,400 km are urban roads, 58,305 
km are national roads, and 86,615 km are local roads.  OR is 
also responsible for the maintenance of the country\'s 1,965 
road bridges. 
 
3. The DRC\'s most important road axes in terms of commerce 
and physical linkage between strategic locations are its four 
Routes Nationales (RN - National Routes).  National Route No. 
1 (RN1) is a heavily traveled commercial route stretching 
from the Atlantic coast of the DRC to the port of Matadi then 
to Kinshasa and onward to Katanga.  National Route No. 2 
(RN2) runs from Mbuji Mayi in Kasai Oriental province to 
Bukavu in South Kivu province and to Kasongo in Maniema 
province.  National Route No. 3 (RN3) links Kisangani in 
Orientale province with Bukavu in South Kivu province. 
National Route No. 4 (RN4) runs from the frontier with the 
Central African Republic to Kisangani and Bunia in Orientale 
province and to Beni in North Kivu province. 
 
4. The DRC\'s road network has deteriorated steadily over the 
past decade.  According to Ministry of Transport and World 
Bank assessments, 75 percent of the country\'s roads are in 
poor condition, 15 percent are in fair condition, and only 10 
percent are in good condition.  Notable damage occurred 
during periods of conflict when roads and bridges were 
sabotaged by various combatant groups to prevent pursuit by, 
or resupply and reinforcement of, their opponents.  However, 
the primary factor has been a severe lack of maintenance and 
repair.  In addition to a general absence of upkeep, many 
roads were poorly or hastily constructed to begin with.  Bad 
grading, thinly paved driving surfaces, and an absence of 
ballast materials have resulted in rapid deterioration. 
 
5. GDRC funding for OR has dried up in recent years.  Most of 
the taxes and \"parafiscalities\" that had traditionally 
financed OR operations were ended by the transitional 
government.  (Note: One such tax, a fuel surcharge, was 
halted because former President Laurent Kabila had organized 
a well-masked diversion of revenues away from OR to finance 
his war efforts.  Such politicized redirection of funds 
raises questions about the sustainability of maintenance 
operations.  End Note.)  A study conducted by the Ministry of 
Transportation estimates that complete rehabilitation of the 
DRC\'s main roads will cost USD 2.8 billion.  (Comment: This 
estimate is likely inflated, and points to GDRC attempts to 
obtain as much international financial support as possible. 
However, the high figure does reflect the severity of the 
state of disrepair.  End Comment.) 
 
6. International donors have recognized the importance of a 
well-maintained road network to the DRC\'s economic and 
political recovery.  The World Bank made road rehabilitation 
a priority of its Programme Multisectoriel d\'Urgence de 
Rehabilitation et de Reconstruction (PMURR), and committed 
USD 400 million for repairs of RN1.  RN1\'s state of disrepair 
had been estimated by the GDRC to add 40 percent to the price 
of goods on the Kinshasa market.  Repairs to the route were 
completed in early 2004.  (Note: Prices did decrease somewhat 
after RN1 was repaired, but not the 40 percent predicted by 
GDRC analysis.  End Note.)  Additionally, the World Bank and 
IMF recently committed USD 90 million for repairs of RN2 and 
RN4.  Work on these projects is scheduled to begin in late 
2004.  (Comment: World Bank-funded repairs are contracted out 
to domestic and international firms of varying quality and 
expertise.  Repairs to RN1 were conducted by Chinese, 
European, and local firms, and are substandard in places (see 
ref A).  The road was only thinly paved with asphalt, and 
lacks sufficient ballast to protect against erosion 
associated with the DRC\'s rainy season.  Less than a year 
after the completion of repairs, the road surface is already 
beginning to deteriorate.  End Comment.) 
7. When questioned by Econoffs regarding availability of 
funding for upkeep of newly repaired roads, both OR 
representative Kalembe Kiala and Minister of Transport Joseph 
Olenghankoy admitted that few revenue generating mechanisms 
are currently in place, and that little funding is expected 
from the GDRC.  Mr. Kiala suggested a renewal of various 
taxes and tolls, but questioned their political feasibility. 
Mr. Olenghankoy expressed his wish to see road construction 
and management privatized, but acknowledged that the system 
was not likely to attract a buyer. 
 
8. Comment: International assistance to rehabilitate the DRC 
road network may be for naught.  Without proper funding to 
maintain repaired roads, they will rapidly return to an 
impassable state.  The World Bank and bilateral donors have 
pumped cash into the sector, but will see little benefit 
unless the GDRC takes the difficult but necessary steps to 
establish revenue generating mechanisms to fund proper 
upkeep.  End Comment. 
 
Rail Assessment 
--------------- 
 
9. The DRC\'s 3,600 km of railways are managed by the 
parastatal Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo 
(SNCC).  An additional 360 km line linking Kinshasa with the 
Port of Matadi is managed by ONATRA (port authority).  The 
DRC\'s rail network is aged, but generally in decent repair. 
However, a shortage of locomotives and rolling stock severely 
limits transportation capacity.  SNCC owns nearly 90 
locomotives of which only approximately 10 electric 
(catenary) and 20 diesel units (8 of which are rented from 
South African companies) are serviceable.  These locomotives 
are scattered throughout SNCC\'s rail network, and only a 
portion are in commercial use.  (Note: There is an additional 
railway, Chemins de Fer des Ueles, connecting Bumba to 
Mungbere with branches to Bondo and Andoma-Titule in 
Orientale province.  However, the railway is in severe 
disrepair and is not slated to receive any international 
funding to assist with rehabiliation.  End Note.) 
 
10. SNCC currently operates three primary rail lines.  The 
first links Sakania, Lubumbashi, Likasi, and Kamina in 
Katanga province; the second, Lubumbashi, Tenke, and Dilolo 
in Katanga province; and the third, Kamina, Kindu, Kabalo, 
and Kalemie in Maniema and Katanga provinces.  (Note: There 
are no rail links between the DRC\'s eastern provinces and the 
interior or Kinshasa.  End Note.) 
 
11. Most of SNCC\'s troubles can be attributed to a lack of 
funding for maintenance and repairs.  GDRC financing for rail 
transportation was curtailed over the last decade. 
Furthermore, SNCC was particularly hard hit by the collapse 
of Gecamines (mining parastatal), which had once provided 65 
percent of SNCC\'s revenues.  The remaining passenger, 
agricultural, and freight traffic have been insufficient to 
fund proper equipment upkeep.  Continuing tensions in the 
eastern provinces have also kept some lines out of operation, 
and have deterred donors from funding necessary repairs. 
 
12. Ministry of Transportation estimates put the cost of 
total rehabilitation of the DRC\'s railways at USD 1.1 
billion.  (Comment: As with the Ministry\'s road repair 
estimates, this figure is probably inflated, but reflects the 
gravity of the situation.  End Comment.)  SNCC is slated to 
receive USD 60 million as part of the World Bank\'s PMURR 
project.  This will fund repairs to 50km of track and several 
bridges, the purchase of 75 new railcars, and the 
rehabilitation and purchase of spare parts for 10 
locomotives.  In addition, USAID recently funded USD 1.3 
million worth of track and bridge repairs to reopen the 
Kabalo-Kindu line (see ref B).  (Note: The USAID-funded 
project was significant in that it connected Kindu to 
Lubumbashi, bridging a major gap in SNCC\'s rail network.  The 
Zofu bridge on Kabalo-Kindu line had been sabotaged during 
the war, and because SNCC has sent all of its locomotives 
south into Katanga to prevent looting, the bridge\'s 
destruction kept otherwise usable track out of service.  End 
Note.) 
 
13.  ONATRA\'s Matadi-Kinshasa line is in a decent state of 
repair, but also suffers from a lack of locomotives and 
rolling stock.  Because the line transports goods from the 
DRC\'s major international port, it enjoys a steadier revenue 
stream than most SNCC lines.  However, ONATRA has been forced 
to cannibalize its equipment to maintain semi-regular 
operations. 
 
14. Comment: Although the DRC\'s rail network is less 
maintenance-intensive than its roads, it still requires 
regular upkeep.  More locomotives and railcars will have to 
be purchased to increase SNCC and ONATRA capacity if they 
hope to become self-sustaining.  This requires more capital 
than can currently be mustered by either enterprise.  End 
Comment. 
 
Final Comment 
------------- 
15. The World Bank and bilateral donors face difficult 
decisions regarding the efficacy and sustainability of their 
road and rail rehabilitation strategies.  Deterioration of 
the DRC\'s transportation network has been slowed by external 
financial assistance, but this is a temporary solution at 
best.  The GDRC must take action to revive old revenue 
streams or create new ones in order to fund upkeep.  In 
addition, taxes and fees must contribute to the services for 
which they were intended.  Diversion of the funds defeats 
their purpose.  Selective privatization may be a workable 
long-term solution, but numerous political and economic 
hurdles must first be overcome (e.g. continuing insecurity, 
low formal sector activity, ineffective legal system, etc.). 
In the meantime, the DRC\'s road and rail infrastructure - the 
backbone of the country\'s economic recovery - will depend on 
the continued generosity of the donor community, where 
similar sustainability concerns have been raised.  The 
Belgian Embassy and Belgian Cooperation (Belgian aid 
organization) have planned a roundtable for mid-October 
focusing on infrastructure-related programs and concerns. 
All GDRC and donor country officials involved in 
infrastructure planning and development have been invited.

1. Summary.  Prices and exchange rates remain 
relatively stable, with exchange rates showing signs of 
an impending slight increase.  Public transportation 
prices have doubled in Lubumbashi due to higher gas 
prices and taxes.  Zimtrade will hold a trade fair in 
Lubumbashi.  RVF (river transportation authority) 
workers have ended their strike after RVF management 
agreed to pay a portion of their salary arrears in time 
to meet back-to-school expenses.  SNEL plans to dredge 
the canals at Inga I and II to increase generating 
capacity.  End Summary. 
 
MONETARY AND PRICE UPDATE 
 
2. Prices remain stable.  Higher demand for pens, 
notebooks, etc. due to the start of the school season 
continues to have a slight effect on non-food item 
prices. 
 
3. Although experiencing a slight depreciation, the 
Congolese Franc remains generally stable.  The 
depreciation began in Kinshasa with the distribution of 
some lump-sum salary payments to civil servants. 
However, the most likely cause of the exchange rate 
movement is the increased activity in the exchange 
market due to the need to pay school fees and buy 
school supplies.  Many Congolese who normally keep a 
mix of USD and FC have been purchasing dollars with DC, 
causing the slight depreciation. 
 
TRANSPORTATION 
 
4. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION PRICES RISE IN LUBUMBASHI 
 
Local press reports that the cost of public 
transportation recently doubled in Lubumbashi, from FC 
50 to FC 100.  The price increase has been blamed on 
rising fuel costs due to market pressures and tax 
increases. 
 
TRADE 
 
ZIMTRADE TO HOLD TRADE FAIR IN LUBUMBASHI 
 
5. Local press reports that the Zimbabwean trade 
authority, Zimtrade, will hold a trade fair in 
Lubumbashi at the end of September to showcase 
Zimbabwean products and attract potential buyers and 
investment partners.  The fair will feature Zimbabwean 
manufacturers in the food and beverage, agricultural, 
pharmaceutical, construction, engineering, and mining 
sectors. 
 
LABOR 
 
RVF WORKERS END STRIKE 
 
6. Local press reports that RVF (river transportation 
authority) workers have agreed to return to work after 
striking for several months.  The workers had been 
striking to demand payment of salary arrears.  RVF 
authorities resolved the dispute after agreeing to 
disburse money to cover the school fees of workers\' 
children, and to pay salaries from January and February 
of 2004.  RVF management also reportedly plans to 
organize a committee to lobby other GDRC agencies, 
ministries, and local businesses for payment of their 
debts to RVF. 
 
WORLD BANK TO PAY OCPT WORKERS 
 
7. The World Bank has agreed to pay USD 10.8 million in 
severance packages to retiring and voluntarily 
departing OCPT (post and telecommunications parastatal) 
workers.  Approximately 3,000 workers are slated to be 
released by September 25th, 2004. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
SNEL SOLICITS DREDGING FOR INGA I AND II 
 
8. Local press reports that SNEL (electricity 
parastatal) is negotiating with private dredging firms 
to contract for the removal of 30,000 cubic meters of 
silt from the Inga I and II canals.  SNEL has suffered 
from shortages of generating capacity at the Inga 
hydroelectric complex due to low Congo River water 
levels, silting of the dams\' intake canals, and 
equipment deterioration. 
 
AID 
 
JAPANESE FIRM TO BUILD HOSPITAL IN KINSHASA 
 
9. Local press reports that the Japanese firm 
Tokoshukai plans to build a 600-bed hospital in 
Kinshasa.  A delegation from the firm recently visited 
the DRC to survey proposed building sites.

SUBJECT: AIR KASAI ENCOUNTERS TURBULENCE 
 
 
1. Sensitive but unclassified.  Protect accordingly. 
 
2. (U) Summary.  Air Kasai, a private aviation firm, built 
numerous airstrips in Kasai Occidental province to provide 
air transportation to otherwise isolated diamond mining 
areas.  Soon after launching its operations, Air Kasai 
encountered opposition from local government officials, 
traditional chieftans, and rival companies that resulted in 
government attempts to expropriate its airstrips.  Government 
action is still pending, and Air Kasai is fighting the 
expropriation decision.  This episode demonstrates some of 
the difficulties of doing business in the DRC and illustrates 
the frailty of the country\'s property rights and commercial 
law.  End Summary. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
3. (U) Air Kasai, a private aviation firm, was incorporated 
in the DRC approximately two years ago.  The company operates 
Russian Antonovs (2 AN-2s and 3 AN-26s) within Kasai 
Occidental province and between Kasai Occidental and 
Kinshasa.  Air Kasai bought plots of land in Kasai Occidental 
from the GDRC on which to build airstrips for the company\'s 
exclusive use.  These eleven airstrips allowed Air Kasai to 
offer transportation to otherwise inaccessible areas in Kasai 
Occidental\'s diamond mining regions. 
 
4. (U) Air Kasai\'s operations contributed to an overall 
increase in the DRC\'s diamond exports by opening 
transportation links to previously isolated locales.  They 
also provide a lifeline for transport of goods into remote 
areas not easily reached by bush roads.  At the outset, 
business was good for Air Kasai.  The company\'s monopoly on 
air transportation in Kasai Occidental allowed significant 
control over pricing, with a half-hour flight costing 
approximately USD 300 per passenger. 
 
Complaints 
---------- 
 
5. (U) Shortly after Air Kasai launched its operations, local 
\"chefs coutumiers\" (traditional chieftans holding little 
formal power but significant social influence) began 
complaining that Air Kasai had unlawfully constructed 
airstrips on their land, despite the fact that Air Kasai had 
purchased legal title to the property.  The chieftans 
demanded compensation and took their grievances to the 
provincial authorities in Tshikapa.  (Comment: Local 
chieftans quite often demand payment from companies operating 
in their zones of influence.  Absent government financing and 
attention, the chieftans attempt to collect funds from any 
available source.  End Comment.) 
 
6. (SBU) Provincial officials in Tshikapa took up the cause 
and complained to RVA (air transportation authority) and the 
Ministry of Transportation that Air Kasai \"did not respect 
the laws\" and \"had refused to assist the government during 
the expulsion of Congolese from Angola.\"  (Note: This refers 
to the forced repatriation of Congolese engaged in illicit 
mining activities in Angola.  End Note.)  Provincial 
officials, including the mayor of Tshikapa, reiterated their 
protests to Econoffs during a recent visit to Kasai 
Occidental.  The mayor of Tshikapa also added to the list of 
grievances the fact that \"Air Kasai does not permit 
government officials to fly for free.\" 
 
7. (SBU) Meanwhile, a rival aviation firm, Thom\'s Airways, 
requested and was denied the use of Air Kasai\'s private 
airstrips.  Thom\'s Airways also complained to RVA and the 
Ministry of Transportation, claiming that Air Kasai was 
engaging in unfair business practices.  Air Kasai responded 
that it had paid for the land and constructed the airstrips, 
and was therefore entitled to their exclusive use.  (Comment: 
Thom\'s Airways owns only a single AN-2 which it operates 
infrequently.  Air Kasai claims that Thom\'s Airways is little 
more than a front for its owner\'s diamond business.  End 
Comment.) 
 
Intervention 
------------ 
 
8. (SBU) Under pressure from the chieftans, local authorities 
in Tshikapa, Thom\'s Airways, and RVA, the Minister of 
Transportation signed a decree expropriating Air Kasai\'s 
airstrips without compensation.  The expropriation is still 
pending, and Air Kasai is fighting the decision.  (Comment: 
Air Kasai insinuated to Econoffs that Thom\'s Airways 
influenced the Minister of Transportation with contributions 
of illegal diamond revenues.  End Comment.) 
 
9. (SBU) Air Kasai has since agreed to grant Thom\'s Airways 
landing rights on a fee-per-use basis until the expropriation 
issue is resovled.  (Note: After receiving permission to use 
Air Kasai\'s airstrips, Thom\'s Airways promptly began 
undercutting Air Kasai\'s prices, flying freight into Kasai 
Occidental for a third of its rivals\' prices.  End Note.) 
However, the chefs coutumiers and officials in Tshikapa have 
not been placated, and continue their complaints.  Grievances 
against Air Kasai were a common theme of Econoffs\' recent 
visit to Tshikapa. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) RVA and Ministry of Transportation attempts to 
expropriate Air Kasai\'s airstrips demonstrate the frailty of 
property rights and commercial law in the DRC.  With investor 
confidence tenuous at best, government expropriation of 
private assets can only further discourage new investment. 
 
11. (SBU) Air Kasai\'s troubles also illustrate several 
unwritten rules of business in the DRC.  Local chieftains 
should be treated with caution and respect as they carry 
influence beyond their official status.  Small favors (such 
as occassional free flights for local government officials) 
or outright payments are sometimes necessary to grease the 
wheels of private commercial ventures.  Finally, official 
permission and legal documentation offer scant protection 
when political or social interests are aligned against a 
firm, especially if the firm is a small or medium-sized 
business without international backing.  End Comment.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/15/2014 
TAGS: PGOV, CG, PREL, MARR, MONUC 
SUBJECT: CONGOLESE, MONUC VIEWS ON TRILATERAL AGREEMENT AND 
JVM 
 
Classified By: POLCOUNS MSANDERSON, REASONS 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  The DRC appears willing to sign both a 
Trilateral Agreement and a Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM) 
in New York during the UNGA.  The GDRC is continuing to press 
for agreement on terms of reference of the JVM, since it 
believes a Trilateral Agreement among the DRC, Uganda and 
Rwanda would be yet another \"paper tiger\" accord without an 
effective and functional JVM in place.  We believe it is 
important that SecGen Annan bring the parties together on the 
margins of the UNGA in New York to finalize the terms of 
reference of the JVM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (C) Both National Security Advisor Guillaume Samba Kaputo 
and Presidential Advisor Andre Kapanga told us September 10 
that because the DRC strongly supports a trilateral agreement 
President Kabila wants to make sure that it is effective.  To 
that end, the President continues to insist that Rwanda and 
the DRC reach agreement on the terms of reference of the 
Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM), which will ensure that 
the confidence building measures of the trilateral agreement 
actually work.  According to MONUC, Kigali has again proposed 
changes to the JVM, the latest coming on the same day that 
Kinshasa had sent a letter accepting the proposed terms of 
reference unchanged, an agreement which clearly has once 
again been overtaken by Rwanda\'s changes.  MONUC, from whom 
we received copies of the Rwandan proposals, reminded us that 
Rwanda has consistently refused to meet with SRSG Swing to 
discuss the terms of reference. 
 
3. (C) President Kabila responded September 7 to the SecGen\'s 
letter on the JVM, accepting/accepting the document as 
written -- including the elimination of the phrase calling 
for immediate investigation of all reports, which was a major 
concession by Kinshasa.  The Congolese also have named all 
their team members for the JVM, and forwarded those to the 
SecGen as well.  They have, therefore, fully complied with 
the initial requirements to operationalize the JVM, as 
outlined in the SecGen\'s August 18 letter to the three 
Presidents. 
 
4. (C) On the same day (September 7) President Kagame wrote 
to the SecGen proposing further/further revisions to the 
terms of reference -- revisions of which Kabila clearly could 
not have been aware.  These include a demand to \"verify 
Congolese interference in internal Rwandan politics\" -- a 
point not previously raised, to our knowledge.  We presume, 
therefore, that the JVM will still require further 
consideration. 
 
5. (C) MONUC expressed considerable surprise at the new 
demands by Kigali, and observed that Rwanda has consistently 
found a way to delay progress on the JVM, first by refusing 
to meet with Swing to discuss it (even when Swing went twice 
to Kigali after meetings were promised), and now by 
constantly proposing new elements to the terms of reference. 
 
6. (C) On the Congolese side, the frustration which President 
Kabila expressed personally the USG delegation during their 
visit to Kinshasa on August 26 to discuss the trilateral 
agreement continues to echo loudly here.  Both Samba Kaputo 
and Kapanga (striking because the latter normally is much 
more moderate) said bluntly that the DRC cannot understand 
why Kinshasa always seems to be cast in the spoiler role. 
Both questioned the utility of signing yet another \"paper 
tiger\" accord, which is all the trilateral agreement would be 
absent an effective and functional JVM. 
 
7. (C) Both agreed that confidence-building measures are 
essential to stop mutual recriminations and establish an 
environment in which genuine progress could be made -- 
together with MONUC -- on addressing the FDLR/Interahamwe 
issue, as called for in the trilateral document.  Absent the 
JVM, however, such an environment would exist only in theory. 
 
8. (C) Kaputo indicated on September 10 that the Presidency 
might, however, be open to the idea of signing both documents 
together in New York, ie., the JVM first (presumably 
following a meeting hosted by the SecGen to work out 
remaining differences on the terms of reference), and then 
the trilateral agreement. 
 
9. (C) On September 15 at a lunch hosted by the Ambassador, 
Kapanga reiterated that the GDRC wants to move forward on the 
Trilateral Agreement and the JVM.  He pointed out that 
Rwanda\'s revisions to the JVM had been accepted three times 
by the GDRC, but added that it was his understanding (from 
sources he did not share) that the SecGen would not accept 
the latest revisions being proposed by the Rwandans. 
 
10. (C) The Ambassador provided Kapanga an outline of the 
proposed signing ceremony with Secretary Powell to take place 
in New York on September 23, and Kapanga said the notional 
schedule looked excellent.  While Kapanga was not in a 
position to state categorically that President Kabila would 
sign the agreement, he pointed out that the four principal 
advisors accompanying Kabila to New York (Foreign Minister 
Raymond Ramazani Baya, Ambassador-at-Large Leonard She 
Okitundu, Samba Kaputo, and Kapanga) were all very much in 
favor and would advise the president accordingly.  Kapanga 
went so far as to suggest that Kabila would be willing to 
stay in New York through the 23rd (instead of leaving the 
22nd as initially planned) expressly for a signing ceremony. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
11. (C) Despite frustration that the terms of reference for a 
Joint Verification Mechanism have still not been agreed upon 
(due to what they perceive as Rwanda\'s lack of good faith), 
the Congolese clearly want a trilateral agreement.  We could 
help facilitate the process by exploring with the SecGen\'s 
office if they have already planned, or would be willing to 
consider, hosting a \"reconciliation meeting\" on the margins 
of the UNGA to finalize the terms of reference prior to the 
planned September 23 signing of the trilateral agreement.

SUBJECT: SOUTH KIVU GOVERNOR ON ETHNIC TENSIONS, THREAT 
FROM FDLR 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  South Kivu\'s recently-appointed provincial 
governor told the Ambassador Sept. 8 he is trying to lessen 
ethnic tensions and arrange for Congolese Banyamulenge 
refugees to return to the Congo.  Mai-Mai and especially 
Rwandan FDLR guerillas continue to attack and prey upon South 
Kivu\'s civilian population.  In our view, the governor 
appears to have little influence and a poor grasp of the 
overall situation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) This is the first in a series of cables on the 
Ambassador\'s Sept. 8-10 trip to the cities of Bunia, Bukavu 
and Goma in eastern Congo. 
 
 
Ethnic Tensions 
--------------- 
2. (C) South Kivu provincial governor Augustin Bulahimu told 
the Ambassador and poloff Sept. 8 his top priorities are 
promoting reconciliation between different ethnic groups and 
encouraging the return of Congolese refugees in neighboring 
countries.  This had been made more difficult by the 
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD-Goma) ex-rebel movement\'s 
recent, short-lived decision to boycott the transitional 
government, which angered the local population and \"reheated\" 
the situation in Bukavu.  Nonetheless, Bulahimu said he met 
with Banyamulenge military figure Gen. Patrick Masunzu in 
Uvira recently to discuss the possibility of opening a safe 
corridor, allowing Congolese Banyamulenge refugees in Burundi 
to move into the Minembwe/Haut-Plateau area.  The two agreed 
to set up a small committee to identify returnees and 
ascertain that only Congolese citizens are admitted. 
 
 
Mai-Mai and FDLR Threats 
------------------------ 
3. (C) According to Bulahimu, the RCD-Goma had been too quick 
to accuse Congolese Mai-Mai groups of being behind the August 
13 Gatumba refugee camp massacre in Burundi.  The various 
Mai-Mai groups are a serious problem in South Kivu, however, 
and are notorious rapists.  Another security problem is the 
continued presence of Rwandan guerillas belonging to the 
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR, aka 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe), who likewise prey on the civilian 
population.  For example, FDLR forces attacked civilians near 
Walungu o/a Sept. 2, causing at least 2000 people to flee 
their homes.  World Food Program, World Vision, and U.N. OCHA 
workers are providing aid, but the people there are cold, 
hungry and without shelter--\"a catastrophe\" that gets no 
media coverage.  In contrast, the governor related that days 
earlier he told eight Rwandan families living near Bunyakiri 
they could remain where they are, since they are unarmed and 
pose no threat.  After all, he concluded, \"we\'re not 
xenophobes.\" 
 
 
Bio Note 
-------- 
4. (C) Bulahimu said it was a surprise when GDRC 
Vice-President Arthur Z\'Ahidi Ngoma, a friend from childhood, 
picked him for the job.  He reminisced at great length about 
his diplomatic career under the former (Zairean) government, 
and confessed that after so many years away from South 
Kivu--he left as a child in the 1960s--he is virtually a 
stranger in the province. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) The new governor is a fish out of water, and appears 
to have little influence and a poor grasp of the overall 
situation.  Nonetheless, at least he says the right things 
and in conversation with us avoided the kind of knee-jerk 
anti-Rwandan statements that are characteristic of many 
Congolese.  The governor\'s meeting and reported agreement 
with Gen. Masunzu is of note insofar as Masunzu is a 
well-known figure with a base of support within the 
Banyamulenge community, but is also hostile to Kigali and the 
RCD-Goma.  END COMMENT.

REF: A) STATE 185263 B) KINSHASA 00354 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Our responses to the questionnaire have not 
changed dramatically since our last submission in reftel (B). 
 However, there is more narrative explanation due to the 
events of June 3-6. 
 
2.  (SBU)  POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
 
    a.  Yes. 
    b.  There were city-wide demonstrations from June 3-6 that 
        targeted the United Nations which to a certain degree 
        spilled over to the U.S. and other Embassies in 
        Kinshasa.  The objective of the demonstrators was 
        to voice their dissatisfaction with the fact that 
        MONUC (the U.N) did nothing in response to military 
        action taken by a renegade general in the city of 
        Bukavu in eastern Congo. 
    c.  Yes.  The June 3-6 demonstrations did occur in the 
        vicinity of the Embassy.  However, the EAC agreed that 
        this was a result of the fact that the Embassy is 
        located within 2 blocks of MONUC Headquarters. 
    d.  N/A.  There have not been any demonstrations 
        specifically targeting the U.S. Embassy. 
    e.  The June demonstrations were triggered by domestic 
        issues. 
    f.  Although the majority of demonstrations in Kinshasa 
        are peaceful, the June demonstrations were quite 
        violent. 
    g.  There was slight damage to the Embassy - three broken 
        windows from rocks/debris being thrown by the 
        demonstrators. 
    h.  No. 
    i.  Yes.  There are frequent peaceful demonstrations by 
        civil servants and teachers usually due to the lack 
        of payment of salaries. 
    j.  Yes. 
    k.  Although there were several thousands of demonstrators 
        during the events of June 3-6, the average size of 
        most demonstrations is 100-200. 
    l.  Most of the demonstrations are usually peaceful. 
    m.  As mentioned above, the Embassy did suffer minor 
        damage during the June demonstrations. 
 
3.  (SBU)  MACRO CONFLICT CONDITIONS 
 
    a.  Yes. An intrastate conflict. 
    b.  It is limited to the eastern part of the country. 
    c.  No. 
    d.  Some of the factions involved in the conflict have 
        signaled a slight anti-American stance, but nothing 
        too serious. 
 
4.  (SBU)  HOST COUNTRY CAPABILITIES 
 
    a.  No. 
    b.  Yes.  Limited training in document fraud, personal 
        protection and chemical and biological training 
        has been given to a limited number of Congolese 
        security personnel.  The effectiveness of the 
        training is difficult to determine.  However, we 
        believe that the training was somewhat effective 
        and better than none at all. 
    c.  Yes. 
    d.  The Congolese Intelligence Services are as 
        professional as they can be with their limited 
        resources and training. 
    e.  Yes.

        elsewhere in the Congo who may be sympathetic 
        to certain terrorist groups (such as Hamas 
        and Hezbollah), but we believe that there 
        are no known operational cells in the 
        country.  There are reports of a group 
        called the Al Qaida Fan Club but the members 
        are more than likely sympathizers and not 
        operatives.

SUBJECT: MONUC CONCERNED ABOUT REPATRIATION OF BANYAMULENGE 
 
REFUGEES FROM BURUNDI 
 
1. (U) Summary. MONUC poloffs briefed members of the 
diplomatic community September 14 on efforts to repatriate 
Banyamulenge refugees to South Kivu. MONUC wants to 
coordinate humanitarian and security assistance with GDRC 
officials and with other UN agencies to provide protection to 
returning refugees. MONUC is concerned about possible attacks 
and manipulation of the refugee issue. MONUC also referred to 
the UN\'s report on the Gatumba massacre which documents the 
lack of a response by Burundian authorities during the 
incident. The report also recognizes the role that FNL 
militias played in the attack without ruling out 
participation by other regional actors.  End Summary. 
 
MONUC: Important to Assist and Protect Returning Refugees 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (SBU) MONUC political affairs officials briefed members of 
the diplomatic community September 14 about repatriation of 
Congolese Banyamulenge refugees from Burundi to South Kivu. 
So far, 255 families comprising 1413 individuals of 
Banyamulenge background have registered for voluntary 
repatriation. MONUC is coordinating repatriation efforts with 
GDRC and UN agencies (such as the High Commissioner for 
Refugees) and expressed concern about the potential political 
consequences of another attack on returning refugees. 
 
3. (SBU) In MONUC\'s view, the various \"composantes\" within 
the GDRC are willing to work together to assist returning 
Congolese refugees from Burundi. MONUC remains concerned, 
however, that South Kivu\'s civil society leaders could incite 
 ethnic hatred and manipulate the refugee issue. These same 
individuals have claimed that the Gatumba massacre was 
actually a confrontation of armed Banyamulenge refugees with 
another armed group and not a massacre. They have also argued 
for a limit on the number of Banyamulenge refugees who can 
return and have called attention to the danger posed by 
possible \"infiltrators.\"  MONUC briefers encouraged the 
diplomatic community to press the GDRC for a stronger 
response to those inciting ethnic hatred, including possible 
prosecutions. 
 
UN Report on Gatumba: No Group Ruled Out 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Albrecht Conze, Deputy Director of MONUC\'s Political 
Affairs Division, gave a general overview of the UN report on 
the August 13 Gatumba massacre in Burundi. He said that the 
attackers were well prepared and knew where to find the 
Banyamulenge refugees. He noted that the lack of a response 
from Burundian authorities was well documented; in 
particular, the UN found no evidence that a nearby military 
camp had come under heavy attack by the perpetrators of the 
massacre as previously claimed. 
 
5. (SBU) According to Conze, the UN report concludes that the 
Burundian Hutu \"Forces of National Liberation\" (FNL) 
participated in the attack, but unlike Human Rights Watch, 
which only investigated inside Burundi, the UN does not view 
the FNL as the main or sole group responsible for the attack. 
Other actors, including Congolese armed groups, are not ruled 
out as participants. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) MONUC has reason to be concerned about the safety of 
returning Congolese Banyamulenge refugees. The situation in 
South Kivu remains volatile and various groups will try to 
manipulate the refugee issue for their own ends. It is 
precisely this concern over local conditions that has led 
UNHCR officials in Bujumbura and Kinshasa to oppose 
repatriation efforts at this time. However, if the refugees 
want to return on their own, it would be important for UNHCR 
to provide assistance as part of a joint effort involving 
MONUC and DRC officials. Another attack on these refugees 
could lead to renewed fighting in the east and imperil the 
transition in the DRC. End Comment.

1. Sensitive but unclassified.  Protect accordingly. 
 
2. (U) Summary.  Prices decreased slightly, bringing 
monthly inflation to -1.1 percent.  Exchange rates rose 
to rates above FC 400 to the USD.  Diamond exports 
decreased from 2.79 million carats in July to 1.92 
million carats in August.  Angola has resumed the 
forced repatriation of illegal Congolese diamond 
miners.  The central bank announced its plans to issue 
new larger denomination bank notes in 2005. 
Chanimetal, a metalworking firm based in Kinshasa, 
agreed to negotiate a labor dispute with union 
representatives.  DGI (tax authority) announced 
revenues of USD 110 million for the first seven months 
of 2004.  Belgium granted 20 million euros in aid to 
the DRC.  A measles outbreak due to low vaccination 
rates was reported in Equateur province.  End Summary. 
 
MONETARY AND PRICE UPDATE 
 
3. (U) Both food and non-food prices decreased 
slightly, partially due to the decrease in demand for 
school-related supplies now that classes have begun. 
Overall, prices decreased 1 percent, bringing monthly 
inflation to -1.1 percent. 
 
4. (U) The exchange rate has depreciated slightly over 
the past month.  A combination of low diamond prices in 
Antwerp and high international oil prices has increased 
hard currency demands in the DRC.  The IMF reported 
that delayed effects of speculation on political 
stability (post-Gatumba massacre) and seasonal demand 
for USD to pay school fees also contributed to the 
fluctuation.  However, the IMF noted that the 
fluctuations are minor considering that exchange rates 
were at FC 420 to the USD less than a year ago and was 
slightly overvalued at FC 380 to the USD.  The IMF 
expects rates to stabilize shortly. 
 
TRANSPORTATION 
 
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION COSTS RISE IN MBUJI-MAYI 
 
5. (U) Local press reported that the cost of public 
transportation rose sharply in Mbuji-Mayi, from FC 100 
to FC 150.  Rising fuel costs due to market pressures 
and tax increases contributed to the increase in fare 
prices. 
 
MINING 
 
DIAMOND EXPORTS DECREASE IN AUGUST 
 
6. (U) The Ministry of Mines recorded diamond exports 
of 1.92 million carats for a value of USD 64 million 
for the month of August, 2004.  This is a significant 
decrease from July\'s exports of 2.79 million carats. 
(Comment: This is an indication that the DRC diamond 
dealers are holding their supply off the market until 
prices recover in Antwerp.  Prices have decreased 10 
percent over the past few months.  End Comment.) 
 
MORE EXPULSIONS FROM ANGOLA 
 
7. (U) Local press reports that the expulsion and 
forced repatriation of Congolese miners from Angolan 
diamond mining sites has resumed, with approximately 
600 Congolese being repatriated each week.  (Note: 
Angola had previously halted the politically sensitive 
expulsion of Congolese miners after ministerial-level 
dialogue between the two countries.  End Note.) 
 
BANKING 
 
BCC ANNOUNCES NEW BANK NOTES FOR 2005 
 
8. (SBU) The BCC (central bank) announced plans to 
issue new bank notes in denominations of FC 1,000 
(approximately USD 2.50), FC 5,000 (approximately USD 
12.50), FC 10,000 (approximately USD 25), FC 20,000 
(approximately USD 50), and FC 50,000 (approximately 
USD 125) beginning in 2005.  (Comment: This could also 
play a role in speculative activities.  The IMF is not 
in favor of releasing notes in the 10,000s range, as it 
feels the market is not yet prepared to handle such 
large denominations.  End Comment.) 
 
LABOR 
 
CHANIMETAL AGREES TO UNION NEGOTIATIONS 
 
9. (SBU) Local press reported that Chanimetal, a 
metalworking firm based in Kinshasa (note: Chanimetal 
is also the local representative of Motorola in the 
DRC), agreed to meet with union representatives to 
negotiate a labor dispute that has frozen the company\'s 
operations since September 8, 2004.  Workers allege 
that Chanimetal has not fully paid salaries and bonuses 
as prescribed by an inter-professional minimum salary 
agreement (SMIG).  (Comment: Chanimetal executives 
alleged that press accounts were misleading, and that 
the dispute arose from an illegal wildcat strike. 
Chanimetal executives agreed to meet with union heads, 
but had already threatened to terminate workers\' 
contracts if the strike continued.  End Comment.) 
PUBLIC SECTOR 
DGI REVENUES TOP USD 110 MILLION FOR 2004 
 
10. (U) DGI (tax authority) reported revenues of over 
USD 110 million for the first seven months of 2004. 
This is compared to total revenues for 2003 of USD 124 
million.  DGI representatives credited strict 
application of IMF and GDRC structural reform 
initiatives as contributing to the revenue increase. 
 
GDRC ADOPTS PROPOSALS FOR PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM 
 
11. (U) International press reported that the cabinet 
of the GDRC has adopted Ministry of Public Affairs 
proposals for reform of the DRC\'s public sector.  The 
proposal calls for the reform of state procurement 
practices, establishment of a direct deposit payroll 
system for managers, payment of some salary arrears for 
state workers, and the creation of an inter-ministerial 
committee to monitor public administration. 
 
AID 
 
BELGIUM FUNDS 20 MILLION EUROS OF ASSISTANCE PROJECTS 
 
12. (U) Belgian Minister of Cooperation and Development 
Armand de Decker announced that Belgium has granted the 
DRC 20 million euros in aid to improve education, 
health, and food security in the DRC.  In addition, 8 
million euros of the aid will be used to rehabilitate 
rural roads linking important agricultural areas in Bas- 
Congo province. 
 
2 MILLION EUROS IN AID FROM FRANCE 
 
13. (U) OFIDA (customs and tax agency) Deputy Director 
Albert Kasongo Mukonzo reported that the French 
government has donated 2 million euros in aid for the 
construction of two food warehouses and the 
rehabilitation of part of the Kasumbalesa road in 
Katanga province. 
 
HEALTH 
 
4000 CASES OF MEASLES REPORTED IN EQUATEUR 
 
14. (U) Local health authorities and WHO 
representatives in Equateur province reported a sharp 
increase in cases of measles in children aged 6 months 
to 15 years.  Approximately 4000 cases have been 
registered since January 2004.  WHO representatives

1. (C) Summary. On September 10, VP Azarias Ruberwa met with 
a CIAT delegation and complained about the CIAT\'s 
ineffectiveness, the state of army integration, security 
sector reform, and hate media. It is unclear how committed 
Ruberwa and his followers will be to the transition if their 
key demands cannot be met. End summary. 
 
2. (C) Since the RCD/G\'s return on September 1, the Supreme 
Defense Council has met twice. National Security Advisor 
Samba Kaputo told DCM and polcouns on September 10 that the 
council would discuss military integration, disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration (DDR), and what he calls 
\'military missions\' and what Ruberwa calls \'parallel military 
structures.\' On September 6-8, the Council of Ministers 
discussed Ruberwa\'s evaluation of the transition. 
 
RCD/G Hard-liners Meet with CIAT 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) MONUC Poloff told poloff that on September 10 an 
abbreviated CIAT group (South Africa, Belgium, UK, 
Netherlands in its capacity as EU President, Angola and 
African Union) met with Ruberwa (in his capacity as RCD/G 
President) and a group of RCD/G hard-liners who all went to 
Goma during the recent transition standoff. The two-hour 
meeting took place at Ruberwa\'s residence. For 1 1/2 hours, 
Ruberwa went through the standard litany of RCD/G complaints. 
He complained extensively about the CIAT\'s ineffectiveness, 
said the CIAT was partly to blame for past problems with the 
transition and would be responsible for future possible 
problems if it did not take a more active role--perhaps as an 
arbitrator of disputes. He also complained that the 
Independent Electoral Commission (CEI), at the local level, 
would be staffed by PPRD faithful because the CIAT failed to 
support earlier RCD/G calls for representation for all 
components at all levels of the electoral process. (Comment: 
Earlier this year, we and other CIAT members lobbied hard to 
prevent precisely what Ruberwa is proposing, because it would 
have politicized the CEI and rendered it unwieldy. End 
comment.) 
 
4. (C) Ruberwa also complained about parallel military 
structures, nonexistent progress on army integration, 
security sector reform and hate media (septel). He said that 
there was very little money in the budget for general 
military expenditures, and no money in the current budget for 
army integration. (Comment: These two points are valid. Most 
military spending is decided by the \'Maison Militaire\'--an 
advisory structure within the Presidency. End comment). 
Ruberwa said there has been no progress on security sector 
reform, citing as an example the fact that the ANR (the main 
intelligence agency) has never submitted a single report to 
him. Finally, Ruberwa loudly complained about the climate of 
hate media which he claims is being supported directly by 
those close to the President. (Comment: This serious 
allegation has some merit. On September 9, moderate Vice 
Minister of Interior, Paul Musafiri (MLC) told polcouns that 
for $100, anyone could go on television and say anything they 
wanted. He suggested that PPRD members had provided money to 
certain individuals, including Pastor Ngoy, to deliver 
anti-Banyamulenge messages. End comment.) 
 
Comment 
-------- 
 
5. (C) CIAT colleagues present told the Ambassador that it 
was a fatiguing exercise. Present with Ruberwa in the room 
were a variety of RCD/G leaders, most known as relative 
hard-liners. None of the non-Tutsi RCD/G Ministers who 
refused to accompany Ruberwa to Goma recently nor associate 
themselves with the RCD/G decision to \'suspend\' participation 
in the transition were present. Subsequent discussion in the 
CIAT indicated that the CIAT will not make any formal 
response to the many RCD/G points, but rather indicate that 
the CIAT is actively engaged in addressing problems and 
issues that threaten continued progress in the transition, or 
violate principles and provisions of the underlying peace 
accords. 
 
6. (C) Though some of his complaints are valid, Ruberwa has 
played his cards badly. Although intelligent, Ruberwa often 
seems politically blind and has consistently managed to 
present himself as a defender of the Banyamulenge and 
Rwandans first, and of the Congolese second. His often 
emotional reaction to nationality issues seems to have played 
into the hands of extremists (like Bizima Karaha and Moise 
Nyarugabo) within his party, and has probably strengthened 
the hand of PPRD and MLC hard-liners, making compromise on 
key questions such as amnesty and nationality laws that much 
more difficult. Pro-government press, most notably the daily 
L\'Avenir and the digitalcongo.net website, have had a field 
day-- a veritable Ruberwa-roast over the past several days. 
 
7. (C) As the political space for moderate, reasoned debate 
continues to erode, the possibility for political stalemate 
or, worse, conflict, grows larger.  In response, the CIAT 
will likely play a more active role, privately and publicly. 
There is still political will to reach the elections (partly 
because no one party or individual wishes to be identified as 
the spoiler, and we believe that this commonality of 
interests between the international community and the 
Congolese political class, together with progress on some of 
the RCD/G\'s more reasonable demands, will enable the 
transition to recapture momentum. End comment.

SUBJECT: RCD/G WANTS MORE FROM TRANSITION 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1657 
 
Classified By: Poloff Meghan Moore for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary. In exchange for returning to Kinshasa and the 
transitional government on September 1, VP Ruberwa asked the 
government and international community to address a laundry 
list of RCD/G concerns about the transition. The demands, 
which ranged from disbanding parallel military structures and 
firing a military commander to sorting out parastatal 
appointments and ending hate media, did not resonate with 
many Congolese who have vastly different concerns with the 
present state of the transition. End Summary. 
 
It Isn\'t Fair... 
---------------- 
 
2. (C) Ruberwa met with the Ambassador and polcouns on 
September 1 and with the Ambassador, the British Ambassador, 
and former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, who visited the DRC 
in her capacity as a member of the Blair Commission for 
Africa, on September 2. Ruberwa claimed the RCD/G has not 
received equal treatment in the transition, discussed general 
insecurity in the east, and raised what he called the 
\'genocide\' in Gatumba. Ruberwa gave the Ambassador a summary 
of political, military, and economic demands, including an 
end to parallel structures within the transitional 
government, dismissal of certain military commanders, 
convening the Supreme Military Council, removal of recently 
deployed FARDC troops from eastern DRC and a share of posts 
in the parastatals and other government entities. The RCD/G 
also called on the transitional government to end hate media 
and develop a plan to bring refugees back to S. Kivu. See 
para 5 for complete list. 
 
 
...or Working 
------------- 
 
3. (C) In addition to his specific demands, Ruberwa said the 
transition process is not working, and he does not see how 
elections can take place in this type of insecure 
environment. President Kabila makes most important decisions 
within the Presidency and the \'Maison Militaire\' (a parallel 
military advisory structure controlled by the President and 
key hardliners, including Samba Kaputo) without any reference 
to Ruberwa. For example, Ruberwa said he was not informed 
that VP Bemba and Kabila planned to send large numbers of 
troops to the east, which further marginalized his role as VP 
of Politics and Security. (Comment: Bemba sent large numbers 
of troops from Gbadolite and reportedly received several 
million dollars for ferrying troops in his planes. End 
comment.) Ruberwa said that S. Kivu military commander BG 
Mabe had deliberately integrated anti-Banyamulenge forces 
into the military, which has contributed to a generally 
anti-Banyamulenge, anti-RCD, and anti-Ruberwa policy on the 
part of the former government. 
 
Mbeki\'s Mediation 
----------------- 
 
4. (C) Ruberwa said he was very happy with South African 
President Thabo Mbeki\'s mediation efforts during his August 
30-31 visit to Kinshasa. (Note: On September 10, he told a 
CIAT delegation the same thing. See septel. End note.) 
Ruberwa said Mbeki wanted to see the Global Accord respected, 
understood there were stresses in the transition, and tried 
hard to mediate specifically between Kabila and Ruberwa. 
(Comment: In fact, one presidential advisor told polcouns 
that Mbeki\'s high-profile involvement angered President 
Kabila, and led to Kabila\'s refusal to meet jointly with 
Ruberwa and Mbeki during the latter\'s visit, forcing the 
South African President into a series of time-consuming 
\'shuttle diplomacy\' meetings--a method later confirmed by the 
South African Ambassador in a CIAT briefing. End comment.) 
 
What does the RCD/G want? 
------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The RCD/G\'s list of demands, as presented in Ruberwa\'s 
August 31 letter to Mbeki, follows: 
 
--End parallel structures within the transitional government 
and encourage the normal functioning of Institutions set up 
by the All Global and Inclusive Accord 
 
--Set up a joint mechanism (CIAT ) Components) to evaluate 
the transition every three months and include the mediator 
and the co-mediators in the follow-up process for the 
transition 
 
--Recognize the role of the Vice President in charge of the 
Political, Defense and Security Commission in the daily 
management of military, security and diplomatic issues, as 
well as his authority over the army and security services 
 
--Finish dividing up \'responsibilities\' within the 
parastatals, financial enterprises, security services and the 
local provincial administration. Until divided, retain 
existing structures put in place by the various 
administrations 
 
--Release individuals jailed for political opinions or 
membership in the RCD 
Military Demands 
--Dismiss the 10th Military Region Commander (BG Mbuja Mabe) 
and certain of his officers who were \'actual or intellectual\' 
authors of the Gatumba genocide, and killings and massacres 
in Bukavu and Kalehe (Comment. There is no proof to support 
these allegations. End comment.) 
 
--Convene the Defense Supreme Council and establish a 
calendar of meetings (done) 
 
--Immediately set up a mechanism to identify and neutralize 
ex-FAR, Interahamwe and FNL militia who are hiding in the 
FARDC 
 
--Reinstate all former ANC commanders and put them back in 
control of their respective units until the army integration 
process is complete 
 
--Stop all new deployments of troops to eastern DRC until the 
regular integration process is complete 
 
--Regroup recently deployed troops to eastern DRC outside 
North and South Kivu until integration can take place and 
negative forces (ex-FAR, Interahamwe, and FNL) can be removed 
from the FARDC 
 
--Reinstate the 8th Military Region Commander\'s (BG Obedi) 
authority over all of North Kivu 
 
--Immediately release arrested former ANC military officers 
 
Economic/Financial Demands 
--------------------------- 
 
--Allow Goma-based companies and enterprises which were 
authorized by the former RCD administration to operate 
throughout the country 
 
--Audit public property management without obstructions from 
state agencies 
 
--Submit large expenditures of all government agencies, 
including the Presidency, to public bid procedures and make 
joint decisions on government expenditures 
 
Other Concerns 
-------------- 
 
--Set a time-line for the return of refugees from Burundi and 
Rwanda, and provide for the refugees\' security 
 
--End hate media, as well as discriminatory, racist, ethnic 
and xenophobic speeches 
 
--Ensure non-discriminatory access to official media for all 
political parties 
 
Comment 
-------- 
 
6. (C) Ruberwa\'s demands are focused on RCD/G and 
Banyamulenge concerns and are out-of-touch with political 
realities in much of eastern DRC and Kinshasa. Most Congolese 
hope to get to elections as quickly as possible and want to 
see more of the central government--not less. Ruberwa 
undoubtedly feels buffeted by strong forces he cannot 
control. He is mistrusted by most of the political leaders in 
Kinshasa, he is under attack from Bizima Karaha and other 
hard-liners within his own party, and not unrelated--he 
harbors strong fears for his personal security at all times. 
His inability to act as a national vice president by seeing 
past his political party and ethnic identity, however, 
severely limits his effectiveness as a party and national 
leader. Moreover, the problem is made worse by his tendency 
to make unhelpful, impassioned statements when provoked by a 
perceived injury to one of his constituencies. (Note: Unless 
provoked he has an intensely legal, pedantic style of 
speaking. End note.) We will encourage Ruberwa to think and 
act to present the RCD/G as a national political party and 
not as an ethnic movement, to further his own interests as 
well as those of his core constituency and the country 
generally. Most importantly, we will stress the importance of 
avoiding any military actions that will only work to the 
further detriment of Tutsis and other groups in the east, and 
to his own party. He and other RCD/G leaders, however, must 
be aware of their very limited popular support and therefore 
limited options for a political future in a post-election DRC.

1. (C)  Summary. There may be a total of 10,000 
Interahamwe/FDLR elements spread out between Beni and Bukavu, 
but it is unclear whether the FARDC is working with them. 
There has been serious, sustained fighting in southern North 
Kivu between Mai Mai and former ANC (military wing of the 
RCD/G) troops. General Obedi does not fully control the North 
Kivu military region. End Summary. 
 
FDLR/Interahamwe Involvement 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (C)  North Kivu Governor Serufuli estimates a total of 
10,000 Interahamwe/FDLR elements spread out between Beni and 
Bukavu, including a number who had been previously 
repatriated to Rwanda. It is unclear, however, what they are 
up to, and whether they are working with the FARDC. There has 
been no overt, large-scale cooperation between regular FARDC 
troops and Interahamwe/FDLR, but there have been 
long-standing rumors of Mai Mai/ Interahamwe/FDLR cooperation 
in both Kivus. VP Ruberwa\'s Chief of Staff Emungu told 
polcouns that S. Kivu military commander Mabe\'s personal 
bodyguard included Interahamwe/FDLR elements who were also 
being used to protect the Bukavu airport.  In North Kivu, 
Governor Serufuli alleges Interahamwe/FDLR elements are 
fighting with Mai Mai in Masisi. A MONUC internal report, 
however, said that Interahamwe/FDLR elements in the Masisi 
territory withdrew, and did not appear to be involved in the 
fighting. (Comment: The most likely scenario is that certain 
Mai Mai commanders share information, equipment and 
ammunition, and work with Interahamwe/FDLR elements on a 
case-by-case basis. They may also use a limited number of 
Interahamwe/FDLR troops in Mai Mai offensives. Regular 
FARDC-Interahamwe/FDLR cooperation is less likely, but 
small-scale intermingling probably occurs. End comment.) 
MONUC Butembo officer estimates that 2-3,000 
Interahamwe/FDLR-related civilians have moved north from S. 
Kivu and are just outside Butembo. He told poloff that this 
group consists mostly of Hutu civilians who moved north from 
S. Kivu due to fighting and fears of reprisal attacks. He 
said he did not know their exact intentions. MONUC did not 
report any other recent, large movements of Interahamwe/FDLR. 
 
North Kivu 
---------- 
 
3. (C) As of September 16, a free-for-all was underway in 
Masisi territory between local Mai Mai and ex-ANC soldiers 
from N. Kivu (who are probably loyal to Nkunda), possibly 
FARDC regular soldiers or Mai Mai from S. Kivu, and maybe 
some Interahamwe/FDLR elements. A MONUC internal report said 
that ex-ANC troops were reinforcing Nyabiondo (15 km north of 
Masisi town), and Rwanda had sent troops to Masisi to 
reinforce Nkunda. North Kivu Governor Serufuli told polcouns 
that the situation in Masisi was not a military problem, but 
a political problem involving outside interference from S. 
Kivu and out-of-control Mai Mai who refused to follow orders 
from N. Kivu military commander General Obedi. 
 
4. (C) Serious fighting broke out between Mai Mai and ex-ANC 
troops (possibly loyal to Nkunda) outside Walikale (120 km 
west of Goma) on September 10. (Note: There are credible 
reports that regular and/or Mai Mai elements from N. Kivu, S. 
Kivu and Orientale may be involved in these confrontations. 
End note.) On September 15, a MONUC team attempted to assess 
the situation and evacuate two humanitarian workers. The 
ex-ANC commander who controls the deserted town told the team 
it could not leave the field where the helicopter had landed 
because it was too dangerous. MONUC poloff told poloff that 
S. Kivu military region payments to local Mai Mai surrounding 
Walikale encouraged them to fight the ex-ANC troops, who the 
Mai Mai see as loyal to Nkunda. North Kivu Governor Serufuli 
told polcouns that the Walikale situation was a Mai Mai 
problem that General Padiri, now based in Kisangani, should 
help address. Serufuli said that Generals Obedi, Padiri and 
Mabe were brought to Kinshasa by FARDC Chief of Staff General 
Kisempia to discuss command and control of troops. In his 
analysis, the re-division of the generals\' responsibilities, 
which supposedly re-establishes Obedi control of all N. Kivu, 
could help improve the situation. According to Serufuli, 
Kisempia also plans to send written instructions with Obedi 
when he returns to Goma September 17 or 18 ordering all N. 
Kivu Mai Mai groups to follow Obedi\'s orders. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) Current fighting in northern S. Kivu and southern N. 
Kivu is murky and confusing, in large part because no troops 
in N. Kivu (outside Goma) really report to Obedi. The Mai Mai 
represent a loose collection of local militias. Many respond 
to Padiri and/or Mabe because Mabe recently paid them; a 
large number used to work with or for Padiri; and, they 
collectively hate Nkunda and the RCD/G. Former ANC soldiers 
appear to respond to Nkunda because he paid them, and he used 
to command them. Regular troops north of Kanyabayonga (mostly 
APC from the RCD/KML) appear to respond to Padiri or Mbusa 
Nyamwisi. A MONUC mission to Minova met a Mai Mai commander 
from the Beni-Butembo area in N. Kivu who said he had been 
tasked by General Padiri, based in Kisangani, to help the 4th 
brigade of the N. Kivu military region ensure that Mabe had 
control over the S. Kivu military region. The N. Kivu 4th 
brigade commander, who identified his brigade as a 
\'nationalist unit\' whose objective was to ensure the 
territorial integrity of the DRC, told the team that he had 
decided to attack Nkunda last week because Nkunda\'s troops 
killed a trader and his family in Minova. It is unlikely that 
a written order from Kisempia instructing notoriously 
ill-disciplined Mai Mai to follow Obedi will improve the 
dynamic, or regain control of what might is a volatile 
situation.

1. (C) Summary. The FARDC recently sent up to 2,000 troops to 
South Kivu and has retaken control of a number of villages in 
the area of Kalehe and Minova without facing significant 
resistance. North Kivu, South Kivu and Orientale regional 
military commanders were called in to Kinshasa to discuss 
possible plans to launch a three-prong attack on Nkunda.  End 
summary. 
 
FARDC on the Move 
----------------- 
 
2. (C) Over the past two weeks, the FARDC sent up to 2,000 
troops to S. Kivu (mostly from the 52nd ex-MLC brigade based 
in Gbadolite, with some ex-FAC elements from Kinshasa  and 
Bas-Congo). By September 12, S. Kivu Military Regional 
Commander BG Mabe had retaken control of a number of villages 
in the area of Kalehe and Minova without facing significant 
resistance. A Western journalist told poloffs that the Mai 
Mai commander who captured Minova said he \'walked right in.\' 
On September 15, MONUC military sources reported that troops 
loyal to Nkunda had vacated positions in Minova a week prior 
to Mabe\'s advance. Nkunda\'s troops, who took their weapons, 
probably moved northwest towards Hombo (located on the 
Walikale-Buakvu road) in N. Kivu. There are unconfirmed 
reports that Nkunda is in the Masisi area. On September 11, a 
presidential advisor told polcouns that General Kisempia had 
given BG Mabe permission to advance to the N. Kivu/ S. Kivu 
border, but ordered him to stay out of N. Kivu for now. On 
September 11, there were unconfirmed reports that FARDC 
troops had deployed south and east from Lubutu, Maniema 
towards Walikale. (Comment: FARDC brigades located in Lubutu 
are under the control of General Padiri of the 9th Military 
Region, based in Kisangani, in large due to the incompetence 
of the Maniema Militiary Regional Commander BG Widi Mbuilu. 
End comment.) There have been low-level skirmishes for 
several days in the area of Walikale in N. Kivu between local 
Mai Mai and Tutsi ex-ANC elements (who have been integrated 
into the 9th Military Region, and fall under the control of 
Padiri), and movements of Mai Mai and possibly Interahamwe 
elements near Butembo (septel). 
 
Eastern Generals Recalled to HQ 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) N. Kivu, S. Kivu and Orientale regional military 
commanders (Mabe, Obedi and Padiri) were recalled to Kinshasa 
to discuss possible plans to launch a three-prong attack on 
Nkunda. Padiri arrived on September 12 and was scheduled to 
return to Walikale September 15 to help mediate the Mai Mai 
problem. Obedi and Mabe arrived in Kinshasa September 13, and 
were reportedly still in town on September 15. DATT told 
poloff that although the FARDC would like to replace Obedi 
for incompetence and lack of loyalty and Mabe for talking to 
the press without cleared talking points, the two will 
probably remain in place for now. A source in the Presidency, 
however, speculated to Ambassador and DCM that Mabe will 
retain his job, and that Obedi may be replaced with an 
officer affiliated with the Kabila faction from the Bas-Congo 
Military Region. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
4. (C) It is unclear why Obedi agreed to come to Kinshasa 
(after he refused twice over the past few months) or what the 
FARDC plans to do with him now that he is here. He will face 
tough questions about his loyalty and which of his units the 
FARDC can count on in a fight against Nkunda. (Nkunda relied 
heavily on former RCD/G troops from North Kivu in his Bukavu 
campaign, and Obedi admitted to poloff and DATT that although 
he is loyal to Kinshasa, \'his troops\' may or may not follow 
his orders.) Obedi continues to be a serious problem for 
Kinshasa. On the one hand, he is widely seen as at best 
Nkunda\'s willing accomplice and Rwanda\'s dupe, and at worst a 
traitor. On the other hand, replacing him could anger N. Kivu 
Governor Serufuli, VP Ruberwa, Rwanda and/or trigger an 
Nkunda-led offensive on Goma. Replacing Mabe could prove to 
be equally difficult as the FARDC does not have a good 
alternate in the wings, and because he has become very 
popular in both S. Kivu and Kinshasa for his decisive action 
and public image. Ruberwa\'s extreme dislike for Mabe and the 
FARDC\'s distrust of Obedi may lead to their mutual dismissal, 
but for now, the general status quo is likely to continue.

Minova) over the past several days. A Western observer who 
interviewed IDPs in Ngungu on September 16 told poloff there 
were about 3,500 families or 15,000-20,000 IDPs. The vast 
majority came from the area of Minova September 10-13. 
Several IDPs (including a number who were originally 
displaced in July) told her they fled because they were 
afraid of reprisal attacks from Mabe\'s troops for having 
supported Nkunda. The IDPS also said they would like to 
return home as soon as security conditions permit. Local 
authorities told her there were no known attacks on civilians 
during the recent Mabe advance. 
 
Comment 
------- 
3. (C) As of late August, OCHA estimated there were over 1 
million IDPs in N. and S. Kivu (Reftel). In July, fighting in 
and around Kalehe (30km south of Minova) displaced about 
35,000 people. The 5,000 mostly Hutu Rwandaphones went north 
towards Minova, in Nkunda\'s territory. The other 30,000 
non-Rwandaphones went south behind Mabe\'s lines. Congolese 
armed groups have a well-deserved reputation for reprisal 
attacks on civilian groups who were perceived as aiding and 
abetting the \'enemy,\' and reprisal attacks could have 
occurred as Mabe\'s troops advanced if the civilians had 
stayed in place. There is no evidence, however, of ethnic 
cleansing or large-scale targeted attacks on Rwandaphone 
populations in northern S. Kivu.

SUBJECT: ELECTIONS JEOPARDIZED BY ARMY REFORM PROBLEM, SAYS 
S. KIVU GENERAL 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  Gen. Budja Mabe, Kinshasa\'s senior officer 
in South Kivu, told the Ambassador Sept. 8 the Congo needs 
outside help with military reform in order to be able to hold 
elections.  The FDLR, rebel Congolese officers, and 
neighboring countries are the chief threats to security, and 
the non-Banyamulenge of Uvira are not keen to see the 
Banyamulenge return--a problem that has deep roots. Mabe came 
across as intelligent and articulate, if not completely 
forthcoming, and likely with the sense to tailor his message 
to his USG audience, qualities lacking in many FARDC 
officers.  He appears to want to engage with the USG.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
 
A Motley Collection of Forces 
----------------------------- 
2. (C) 10th Military Region commander Gen. Felix Budja Mabe 
told the Ambassador Sept. 8 he has made some progress on 
military integration, but that the Congolese need outside 
support for further reform.  Without an effective army, there 
will be no security and therefore no elections.  His troops 
include elements from the former government, RCD-Goma, local 
defense forces, Mudundu-40 and the Mai-Mai.  On the plus 
side, he claimed Kinshasa authorities are providing 
consistent (but small) salary payments, discipline is \"sixty 
percent there,\" and people are beginning to respect the chain 
of command.  Incompetence is a major problem, however, 
especially among the Mai-Mai.  Mai-Mai groups are organized 
by clan or locality, and their untrained leaders do not 
deserve their rank.  It would be best to wait until after 
elections to begin demobilizing them, he advised, because 
most Mai-Mai are unqualified to serve in the regular army and 
could become a source of instability when they are cut. 
 
 
Military Threats 
---------------- 
3. (C) Mabe said the major threats to South Kivu are the 
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR, aka 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe), neighboring countries, renegade former 
RCD-Goma officers Laurent Nkunda and Jules Mutebusi, and 
\"the 8th Military Region.\"  (Comment:  This is probably a 
reference to Goma-based 8th Military Region commander Gen. 
Obedi Rwibasira, who is widely believed to have supported 
Nkunda and Mutebusi in their recent revolt.  End Comment.) 
In Mabe\'s view, many if not most FDLR fighters are willing to 
disarm voluntarily and return to Rwanda, but a hard-core 
minority--including most of the senior leaders--restrains 
them.  Overall FDLR strength in the Congo is probably five 
brigades, he estimated, a maximum of 15,000 troops if they 
were at full strength.  Mabe spoke little about Nkunda, other 
than saying the latter\'s troops attacked government forces 
2-3 days earlier but failed to reach their objectives, the 
areas of Kalehe and Kavumu. 
 
 
Longstanding Tensions in Uvira 
------------------------------ 
4. (C) Discussing the situation at Uvira, Mabe said that 
after the Banyamulenge community there fled across the 
border, squatters moved into their homes.  This, plus the 
fact that many non-Banyamulenge long felt that the 
Banyamulenge had \"tried to dominate them,\" means that those 
remaining in Uvira are \"not excited\" about the prospect of 
Banyamulenge refugees returning to the city.  Tensions 
between Banyamulenge and other Congolese in South Kivu also 
stem from long-running land disputes, Mabe explained, because 
the Banyamulenge living in the Haut-Plateau area have had a 
tendency to settle in the mid- and lower Plateau areas as 
well.  There have fights over this since as early as 1964; 
Mobutu had seen fit to station a full battalion of troops in 
the area to quell violence. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) Mabe came across as an intelligent, articulate 
military officer with a good understanding of political 
dynamics--a contrast with many other Congolese officers.  He 
conveyed the appearance of wanting to engage with the U.S., 
and indeed increase future cooperation.  He was not fully 
forthcoming, however, claiming that his troops are being 
regularly paid (they are not).  Nor did he mention impending 
military action within a short time of this meeting, 
apparently designed to move FARDC troops under his command 
further toward boundaries with the neighboring 8th Military 
Region, reclaiming ground controlled by dissident rebel 
General Nkunda.  Instead, he implied that all current clashes 
result from Nkunda initiatives.  Mabe was direct in 
characterizing Interahamwe forces in his military district as 
a major security threat to the region and the resident 
population, asserting that he fully intended to maintain 
operations against Hutu extremists (e.g. FDLR, Interahamwe). 
He also avoided any inflammatory language regarding RCD-Goma 
or Banyamulenge (South Kivu Tutsi) troops.  Mabe has 
certainly been identified, however, as a major problem by 
RCD-Goma and some Congolese Tutsis, as well as by Kigali, so 
how much of his presentation was constructed for his USG 
audience and how much reflects true personal feeling is 
difficult to assess.  Whatever his actual feelings about the 
current military environment in the Kivus, Mabe\'s comments 
about the need for external assistance for Congolese military 
reform are on the mark.  While increased pressure is needed 
to force the Congolese parties to further significant 
military integration moves, it is also true that current 
external support appears inadequate and not well coordinated 
between key parties, including South Africa and Belgium.  END

SUBJECT: NORTH KIVU GOVERNOR HAPPY WITH STATUS QUO 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  North Kivu governor Serufuli told the 
Ambassador Sept. 9 the FDLR remains a threat but Laurent 
Nkunda does not, and his policy is \"good relations with all,\" 
Kinshasa and neighboring countries included.  He is keen to 
promote foreign business investment in the province, and 
traveled to the western U.S. in 2002 partly to do so. 
Serufuli appears quite happy with the political status quo, 
with his own position recognized by but not subordinate to 
Kinshasa and his potential rivals in the RCD-Goma all in the 
capital.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
I\'m OK, You\'re OK 
----------------- 
2. (C) North Kivu provincial governor Eugene Serufuli told 
the Ambassador and poloff Sept. 9 that although FDLR 
guerillas do continue to commit acts of banditry and prey on 
the rural population, renegade former RCD-Goma officer 
Laurent Nkunda \"is a myth\" and poses virtually no threat 
whatsoever.  Serufuli said he communicates directly with 
President Kabila on a regular basis, and wants to maintain 
\"good relations with all,\" the Congo\'s neighbors included. 
To this end, at Serufuli\'s initiative Ugandan and Congolese 
local authorities at several points along the border have 
begun to meet regularly.  Also, until Sept. 8 he was in Beni 
and Butembo in the northern part of the province, where he 
had traveled to coordinate with local officials.  (Comment: 
The Beni-Butembo area, also known as the \"Grand Nord,\" is 
only nominally under Serufuli\'s control;  it remains 
essentially a fiefdom of Mbusa Nyamwisi\'s RCD-K/ML movement. 
End Comment.)  Indeed, he claimed credit by virtue of his 
presentations while on tour for having coaxed out of the bush 
600 Mai-Mai combatants.  MONUC and humanitarian 
representatives confirmed to us that 600 Mai-Mai had indeed 
presented themselves unexpectedly in Beni the previous day, 
provoking some consternation in the local office to come up 
with instant logistics and other arrangements to take care of 
them and transport them to a temporary camp. 
 
 
Open for Business 
----------------- 
3. (C) Serufuli also mentioned that he had traveled to 
Washington state and California in 2002, a trip partly for 
pleasure and partly to drum up business interest in his 
province.  Unfortunately, because U.S. businessmen continue 
to have a negative perception of the situation in the Kivus 
and the Congo, he failed to attract any interest.  Serufuli 
declined to name his U.S. contacts, aside from an NGO based 
in Santa Barbara, California with whom he had discussed the 
possibility of transporting quantities of medical supplies to 
the Congo.  (Bio Note:  Serufuli was trained and worked as an 
anaesthesiologist before embarking on his current career. 
End Note.)  He claimed that the NGO was on the verge of 
sending the supplies but in August 2003 decided not to, and 
inquired whether or not Embassy Kinshasa turned it off 
because the USG still considered Serfuli a rebel.  (Comment: 
The proposed deal was news to us.  End Comment.) 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
4. (C) Serufuli was prominently sporting a national DRC flag 
lapel pin, presumably intended to bolster his credentials as 
a loyal servant of the government, consistent with the 
language he used.  His accompanying chief of staff, however, 
appeared somewhat less nimble, occasionally lapsing to heap 
blame on Kinshasa for all manner of ills, likely a somewhat 
accurate reflection of prevailing sentiment within the 
current North Kivu provincial government.  Serufuli, a North 
Kivu Hutu, appears a clever politician but his rosy picture 
of the security situation and downplaying of the Nkunda 
threat did not ring true.  Nor for that matter his assertions 
that he no longer controls any militia force, a position at 
odds with reports from virtually all other observers 
including locally-based MONUC staff.  Our sense is that he is 
relatively happy with the status quo.  Kinshasa has formally 
recognized him as governor, but has little control over what 
he does, while other rivals in the RCD-Goma are all now back 
in the capital thousands of miles away from constituent 
support in the Kivus.  We suspect that Serufuli would like to 
keep everyone slightly off balance, with neither Kinshasa nor 
Kigali, much less any local forces, gaining a decisive upper 
hand in his home region while he seeks to continue to build 
his own base and maintain a juggling act with other competing 
forces.  END COMMENT.

APPLICATION 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but Unclassified. Privileged Business 
Information. Please Protect Accordingly. 
 
2. (SBU) Embassy Kinshasa has reviewed Alexander\'s Group 
Telecom\'s (ASG - of NY, New York) applications for OPIC 
political risk insurance. ASG has been present in the DRC 
since 1999. It was previously in a joint-venture with LAM 
Telecom, a small Congolese telecommunications company, to 
provide international connectivity. There are still pending 
debts owed to ASG from this venture and LAM with no revenue 
due to its current state of inactivity likely does not have 
the means to pay the debt. Regarding ASG\'s application for 
political risk insurance, the Embassy finds no 
inconsistencies that would lead us to believe that ASG should 
be considered ineligible. Commercial disputes in the DRC 
often take a political route to resolution, however, raising 
the possibility of future political difficulties for ASG. 
 
3. (SBU) Furthermore, commercial prospects for establishing a 
new GSM network in the DRC are not promising. As noted by ASG 
in its business plan, 90 percent of the telecom market of the 
DRC is held by Vodacom and Celtel. Subscribers consider both 
cost and network size when choosing a cellular provider. 
Hence, Vodacom and Celtel which both cover over 60 cities and 
villages have a competitive advantage. Small operators 
currently hold less than 10 percent market share and have not 
had success in expanding their networks, despite lower prices 
(for example Congo-Chine Telecom). 
 
4. (SBU) The following responds to the specific questions 
listed in OPIC\'s standard memo for Embassy comments: 
 
a. Post does not forsee any negative public or host 
government sentiment toward the projects. 
 
b. The projects are unlikely to have negative impacts on U.S. 
policy and interests in the DRC. 
 
c. Post has no knowledge of accusations of improprieties on 
the part of ASG. 
 
d. The project involves the construction of GSM 
telecommunications towers which to the best of Post\'s 
knowledge have no serious associated environmental effects. 
 
e. This project would not conflict with the DRC\'s economic 
objectives or its economic welfare. 
 
f. Post is unaware of potential uneconomic use of raw 
materials or labor. 
 
g. As the project does not involve GDRC action beyond 
licensing and taxation and does not have the GDRC as a target 
market, Post does not forsee any adverse effects on the DRC\'s 
balance of payments.

TAGS: PGOV, CG, RW, ICTR 
SUBJECT: CRY OF ALARM--MISSING ICTR INVESTIGATIONS 
 
 
Classified By: Polcouns Melissa Sanderson for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Embassy Kinshasa previously has expressed 
its concern that ICTR\'s management is sometimes 
counterproductive and reduces its efficiency.  Recently, 
personnel changes have reinforced our concerns.  The Security 
Council anticipates ending investigations by the end of 2004, 
but we fear that effectively the mandate already has been 
relinquished. End Summary. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2. (SBU) As recently as June 29, the Chief Prosecutor of the 
ICTR reported to the UN Security Council that \"most of the 
indicted Rwanda genocidaires still at large are most probably 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and that all the 
efforts being made to apprehend them and transfer them to the 
Tribunal have not borne much success.\"  In our view, part of 
the blame for this failure rests with the ICTR, which has 
failed to provide resources or obfuscated efforts to address 
the problem. 
 
3. (SBU) In November 2003 Ambassador Pierre Prosper and 
Kinshasa Rewards for Justice Coordinator traveled to Arusha 
for discussions with the Tribunal and Kigali with Chief of 
Investigations, Richard Renaud.  At that time Prosecutor 
Jallow and Mr. Renaud were urged to travel to Kinshasa to 
meet with DRC officials and with MONUC to work out procedures 
and arrangements necessary to bring those indicted by the 
Tribunal to justice.  Neither Prosecutor Jallow, nor any of 
the ICTR principals have made the effort to travel to 
Kinshasa to address issues with the government or MONUC. 
 
4. (SBU) Beginning in May 2003 Embassy Kinshasa has requested 
investigative support from the ICTR to track genocidaires 
located in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Republic of 
Congo. These are targets who have been uncovered by tips to 
the Rewards for Justice Program.  The Chief of 
Investigations, Richard Renaud, has only begrudgingly made 
investigators from the Tracking Team available when pressured 
by Embassy Kinshasa or S/WCI.  The governments of the DRC and 
the ROC have arrested five indicted genocidaires with 
investigative assistance from ICTR Tracking Team 
investigators Moussa Sanogo and Michael Penda.  Many more 
potentially could have been brought to justice by a more 
proactive ICTR. 
 
5. (SBU) The UN Security Council has established an exit 
strategy for the ICTR which envisions all investigations and 
arrests completed by the end of 2004.  Recent personnel 
changes suggest that ICTR may already have closed this part 
of its mandate. Investigator Moussa Sanogo, the most senior 
and experienced of the Tracking team investigators has been 
reassigned to provide investigative services for the ongoing 
military trials in Arusha.  Investigator Sanogo has developed 
multiple resources and contacts in Congo-Brazzaville and in 
the DRC over the more than two years he has investigated in 
the area and was involved in all five successful cases. 
 
COMMENT 
-------- 
 
6. (C) Embassy Kinshasa has observed that the Chief of 
Investigations is uncomfortable working with and does not 
seem to trust his African subordinates, and it is alleged 
that he had attempted to replace them with non-Africans of 
his acquaintance.  Mr. Renaud has also been accused of 
preventing or interfering with investigations that would lead 
to the capture of the remaining worst genocidaires. Although 
the government of DRC has requested for two years that the 
ICTR have an ongoing presence in the DRC and although the 
Prosecutor points out that the largest number of remaining 
genocidaires at large are in the DRC, Renaud is disassembling 
the tracking team, effectively preventing further 
investigations in the time remaining.

SUBJECT: SEPT 23 CIAT MEETING-MEDIA, NEW YORK DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Roger Meece. Reason 1.4 (b/d) 
 
1. (U) Summary:  The International Committee to Support the 
Transition (CIAT) met September 23.   The CIAT invited the 
High Media Authority (HAM) officers to exchange views of how 
to best protect the freedom of the press while promoting a 
reconciliation agenda, ensure professional standards, and 
prepare for elections.  SRSG Swing also briefed CIAT members 
on a successful New York agreement to implement the 
DRC/Rwanda Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM), and reported 
that the first JVM meeting would be held October 4.  In 
addition, he reported a Ministerial meeting of CIAT members 
in New York.  The Ambassador received copies of the Secretary 
General,s communique regarding the JVM, and the Ministerial 
CIAT statement.  End summary . 
 
2.  (U) Chiefs of Mission of the International Committee to 
Support the Transition (CIAT) held a meeting September 23 at 
MONUC headquarters in Kinshasa, chaired by SRSG William 
Swing.  In follow-up to previous CIAT discussion of the role 
of the media in the DRC, and particularly the issue of the 
use of the media to exacerbate ethnic or regional tensions as 
well as general professional conduct, officers of the High 
Media Authority (HMA) were invited for the first hour of the 
CIAT meeting.  The HMA was created as one of the \"civil 
society\" structures of the transition to protect the freedom 
of the press and generally promote professionalism in press 
operations, and protect and promote human rights (as a 
component of free speech).  In opening comments, HMA chair 
Modeste Mutinga  laid out the HMA agenda, spelling out HMA 
plans for working commissions to address key areas, 
investigate complaints lodged by individuals, government 
representatives, or members of the media, and HMA authorities 
to levy fines or impose punitive actions in response to 
violations of media norms.  Mutinga also highlighted the 
issue of ensuring access by all parties and other groups to 
government-controlled media.  Mutinga reported that the first 
plenary session of media representatives is planned for 
September 29, but also emphasized that a lack of financial 
resources is hindering full implementation of HMA plans. 
 
3. (C) In the following discussion and in response to 
questions posed by CIAT members, Mutinga noted that the HMA 
takes very seriously its duty to promote liberty of the 
press, but also to respect professional standards. 
Specifically, Mutinga noted that the HMA is currently 
examining several complaints it has received, including some 
allegations of broadcasts that served to inflame ethnic 
tensions.  He said the HMA has requisitioned tapes from the 
relevant media outlets, and in response to the Ambassador,s 
question confirmed that the tapes have been received and are 
being examined.  He said this work should be completed before 
next week,s plenary conference. 
 
4. (U) Following the meeting with HMA officers, SRSG William 
Swing reported to the CIAT that the Secretary General had 
successfully obtained agreement in New York from both the 
Rwandan and DRC governments to implement the long-pending 
Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM).  Amb. Swing reported that 
he has received authority to convene the first meeting of the 
JVM in the region October 4. 
 
5. (U) Amb. Swing also reported that a Ministerial meeting of 
CIAT members had convened in New York September 22.   Amb. 
Swing conveyed to the Ambassador copies of the statement 
issued at the conclusion if this meeting, as well as a 
communique issued by the Secretary General,s office 
regarding the JVM agreement. 
 
6. (C) Comment:  As a repeated former victim of attempts to 
intimidate or otherwise suppress independent press, Mutinga 
seems well-qualified for his role as HMA chair.  While 
clearly hindered by a lack of resources, the HMA officers 
appear serious about carrying out their mandate as 
effectively as possible.  The meeting with the CIAT was 
useful to underscore international interest in media issues, 
and bolster a positive HMA agenda, including the issue of 
so-called &hate media8 or inflammatory language or 
presentations that feed ethnic conflict.  Mutinga later told 
the Ambassador he was pleased with the meeting.  The CIAT 
will likely continue to invite relevant interlocutors to 
discuss key issues, with the Independent Electoral Commission 
targeted for next week, pending their availability.  The New 
York agreements also appear to be good news, satisfying 
long-held GDRC frustrations to get the JVM going, and paving 
the way for increased regional cooperation in other areas. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: CONGO-KINSHASA INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION INFORMATION 
 
REF: STATE 194945 
 
1. PER REFTEL, POST PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON 
ADOPTION IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC). 
RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO LETTERED QUESTIONS IN PARAGRAPH 6 OF 
REFTEL. 
 
A. THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE IS THE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY FOR 
ADOPTION MATTERS IN CONGO-KINSHASA.  WHILE THERE IS NO 
SPECIFIC BRANCH WITHIN THE MINISTRY THAT HANDLES THIS 
SUBJECT, ALL ADOPTIONS ARE PROCESSED THROUGH COMPETENT 
COURTS THAT ARE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTRY OF 
JUSTICE.  THERE IS NO SINGLE PERMANENT PUBLIC CONTACT AT THE 
MINISTRY.  PROSPECTIVE ADOPTING PARENTS SHOULD CONTACT THE 
COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PLACE OF RESIDENCE OF THE 
ADOPTEE. 
 
B. ADOPTING PARENTS MAY BE MARRIED COUPLES, SINGLE PERSONS, 
WIDOWS OR WIDOWERS OR DIVORCEES.  SINGLE PESONS, WIDOWS OR 
WIDOWERS AND DIVORCEES MAY NOT ADOPT A CHILD OF THE OPPOSITE 
SEX UNLESS THE COURT GRANTS AN EXEMPTION.  COUPLES SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS AND BE AT LEAST 15 
YEARS OLDER THAN THE INTENDED ADOPTEE.  THIS \"15-YEAR RULE\" 
MAY BE WAIVED IF THE ADOPTEE IS A NATURAL CHILD OF ONE OF 
THE PARENTS.  ANY PERSON WHO HAS A PRIOR HISTORY OF CHILD 
ABUSE IS NOT PERMITTED TO ADOPT.  THERE IS NO AGE LIMIT FOR 
ADOPTING PARENTS.  NO COUPLE MAY ADOPT MORE THAN THREE 
CHILDREN UNLESS A SUBSEQUENT PROSPECTIVE ADOPTEE IS THE 
BIOLOGICAL CHILD OF ONE OF THE PARENTS.  NO ADOPTIVE PARENT 
MAY MARRY THE ADOPTED CHILD.  THERE IS NO MEDICAL 
INELIGIBILITY GROUNDS FOR ADOPTIVE PARENTS. 
 
C. PROSPECTIVE ADOPTIVE PARENTS NEED NOT BE PERMANENT OR 
LONG-TERM RESIDENTS OF THE DRC. 
 
D. IT CAN TAKE FROM A MINIMUM OF THREE MONTHS TO A MAXIMUM 
ONE YEAR TO COMPLETE THE ADOPTION PROCESS FROM CHILD 
MATCHING TO VISA ISSUANCE. 
 
E. THERE ARE NO ADOPTION AGENCIES IN DRC.  HOWEVER, 
ORPHANAGES MUST BE LISENCED OR ACCREDITED BY THE GOVERNMENT. 
IT IS CUSTOMARY AND ACCEPTED PRACTICE TO ENGAGE CONGOLESE 
LAWYERS TO CARRY OUT ADOPTION PROCEEDINGS.  LAWYERS ARE 
AUTOMATICALLY ACCREDITED BY THE GOVERNMENT BY VIRTUE OF 
THEIR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. 
 
F. COURTS FEES FOR AN ADOPTION CASE AVEERAGE BETWEEN $100 
AND $300.  LAWYERS FEES CAN RANGE FROM $1,000 TO $2,500. 
FEES CAN BE KEPT TO A MINIMUM IF, PRIOR TO THE FIRST 
CONSULATION, ADOPTING PARENTS SECURE ANY REQUIRED DOCUMENTS 
SUCH AS BIRTH, DEATH, MARRIAGE AND RELEVENT COURT RECORDS. 
 
G. THERE IS A KEY LEGAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONGOLESE AND 
AMERICAN OR OTHER WESTERN ADOPTION.  WHILE ADOPTION EXISTS 
AND IS LEGAL IN CONGO, THE LAW ALSO PROTECTS THE LINK TO THE 
BIOLOGICAL FAMILY. THEREFORE, NO ADOPTION IS EVER CONSIDERED 
A COMPLETE SEVERANCE FROM THE BIOLOGICAL FAMILY.  THE ROOTS 
OF THIS UNIQUE CHARACTER OF THE LAW STEM FROM THE FACT THAT 
MOST LOCAL ADOPTIONS RESULT FROM POOR FINANCIAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN A FAMILY AND NOT NECESSARILY THE TRUE 
ORPHAN STATUS OF A CHILD.  THIS UNIQUE PROTECTION, HOWEVER, 
DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH ADOPTION PROCEDURES NOR DOES IT 
RENDER LEGAL ADOPTIONS IN DRC INVALID FOR U.S. VISA 
ISSUANCE.  THERE ARE NO LAWS PROHIBITING FOREIGN NATIONALS 
FROM ADOPTING CONGOLESE CHILDREN.  THE ADOPTION PROCESS IN 
DRC HAS THREE STEPS: 
 
- STEP ONE: OBTAINING CONSENT. 
THE COURT WILL REQUIRE CONSENT TO THE ADOPTION BE SETTLED 
BEFORE GRANTING A JUDGMENT.  BIOLOGICAL PARENTS, OR OTHER 
FAMILY MEMBERS IF ONE OR BOTH PARENTS ARE DECEASED, MUST 
GIVE THEIR CONSENT.  IF NO FAMILY MEMBERS ARE IDENTIFIED, 
THE COURT WILL STEP IN TO DETERMINE CONSENT. ANY CHILD OVER 
THE AGE OF 15 MUST GIVE HIS OR HER OWN CONSENT. 
 
- STEP TWO: THE HEARING.

1. Summary.  Prices are stable, with no inflation 
reported.  Exchange rates continued to rise, with 
parallel markets trading at FC 400-420 per USD.  The 
Australian firm, Anvil Mining, is seeking joint venture 
opportunities in the DRC.  Banro Corporation plans to 
begin its gold exploration operations soon.  A mine 
collapse in Katanga province killed two artisanal 
miners.  The DRC and Angola signed a memorandum of 
understanding on joint offshore oil exploration. 
Italian truck manufacturer Iveco has resumed sales in 
the DRC.  Civil servants in Mbuji-Mayi demonstrated to 
demand pay increases.  The management committee of the 
Postal and Telecommunications Office (OCPT) was 
replaced per OCPT workers\' demands.  Recently renovated 
Regideso pumping facilities in Kisangani were pillaged. 
The World Bank granted the DRC USD 60 million in its 
most recent PMURR disbursement.  End Summary. 
 
MONETARY AND PRICE UPDATE 
 
2. Prices are stable, with no inflation reported. 
Prices have stabilized after fluctuations in demand 
caused by the beginning of the school year.  Monthly 
inflation is -0.9 percent. 
 
3. Exchange rates continue to rise, with the official 
rate remaining above FC 400 per USD.  Parallel rates 
nationwide are now hovering between FC 400-420 per USD. 
Low diamond sector activity, high international oil 
prices, and lump-sum GDRC salary payments are 
contributing to upward pressure on the exchange rate. 
 
MINING 
 
ANVIL MINING SEEKS JOINT VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES 
 
4. International press reported that the Australian 
firm Anvil Mining Ltd. is seeking joint-venture 
opportunities in the DRC with the GDRC and private 
companies.  The company is listed on the Australian 
Stock Exchange. 
 
BANRO PLANS GOLD EXPLORATION 
 
5. Banro Corporation, which holds four concessions on 
the Twangiza-Namoya gold belt, recently received USD 10 
million in financing from private sources to begin 
exploration operations.  According to Banro CEO Peter 
Cowley, the company plans to begin exploration 
immediately and hopes to have at least two mining sites 
in operation by the end of 2004.  Banro holds a 100 
percent interest in its four concessions via a 
renewable 25-year contract. 
 
MINE COLLAPSE KILLS TWO 
 
6. Local press reported that a collapse at the 
Kalukuluku mine in Katanga province killed two 
artisanal miners and injured several others.  (Comment: 
Several recent collapses at mines in Katanga have 
stirred debate on mine safety and the protection of 
artisanal miners.  End Comment.) 
 
PETROLEUM 
 
MEMORANDUM ON PETROLEUM EXPLORATION 
 
7. The governments of the DRC and Angola signed a 
memorandum of understanding on offshore oil exploration 
in the lower Congo basin.  The governments agreed to 
establish a maritime corridor for common exploration in 
which each country will have a 50 percent share. 
 
BANKING 
 
SMALL DENOMINATION BANKNOTES REFUSED 
 
8. Local press reported that merchants in Kamkolobondo 
in Katanga province are refusing to accept FC 5 and FC 
10 notes for payment in commercial transactions.  The 
merchants are claiming that the notes are 
\"inappropriate\" due to their small value.  Refusal to 
accept the small notes is having a strong effect on the 
local fishing industry, a main source of the town\'s 
food supply.  The fishing industry conducts a large 
portion of its transactions with FC 5 and FC 10 notes. 
 
TRANSPORTATION 
 
IVECO RESUMES DRC SALES 
 
9. Local press reported that Italian truck 
manufacturing corporation Iveco has relaunched its DRC 
operations after a decade of inactivity.  The company, 
which once sold almost 600 vehicles per year, lost 90 
percent of its assets in the 1991 pillage.  Sales 
recently resumed with orders for 26 new trucks from 
Safricas, Socitrans, Safbois, Afritrans, et al.  Iveco 
maintained a small staff in the DRC after 1991 despite 
their lack of sales.  Customers have cited this as a 
factor in their choice to buy from Iveco.  Afritrans 
director Nazim Rawji stated that \"Iveco stayed in the 
DRC through difficult times.  This explains our 
allegiance to the brand.\" 
LABOR 
CIVIL SERVANTS DEMONSTRATE IN MBUJI-MAYI 
 
10. Local press reported that approximately 1,200 civil 
servants demonstrated in the streets of Mbuji-Mayi to 
demand salary increases commensurate with their 
colleagues in Kinshasa.  According to union 
representatives, the civil servants are planning to 
strike if their demands are not met by the GDRC. 
 
OCPT MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE REPLACED 
 
11. The management committee of the Postal and 
Telecommunications Office (OCPT) has been replaced, per 
an interministerial decree issued by the Minister of 
Post and Telecommunication and the Minister of 
Portfolio.  OCPT workers had been striking for several 
months, and demanded the committee\'s replacement. 
Workers accused the committee of mismanaging OCPT 
operations and withholding their salaries. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
RENOVATED WATER FACILITIES PILLAGED 
 
12. Recently renovated Regideso facilities at Kisangani 
were looted by soldiers from a nearby camp at Lukusa 
and local civilians.  Refurbished equipment had been 
installed at the pumping facility by the ICRC several 
weeks ago. 
 
AID 
 
WORLD BANK GRANTS DRC USD 60 MILLION 
 
13. In its most recent PMURR disbursement, the World 
Bank granted the DRC USD 60 million for projects 
relating to health, education, and food security. 
According to Social Fund (a GDRC body partially 
managing PMURR funds) Manager Finda Koroma, the money 
will be used to create income-generating opportunities 
for Congolese in rural areas. 
 
FRANCE DONATES 5 MILLION EUROS 
 
14. International press reported that France agreed to 
donate 5 million euros in budgetary aid to the GDRC. 
The aid will be used to finance election preparations 
and debt servicing.

SUBJECT: A HOT, BUT NOT WARM, WELCOME TO RETURNING 
BANYAMULENGE REFUGEES 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 1. (C) Summary:  There were some tense moments over the 
weekend in Uvira, located in southern South Kivu, when 350 
Banyamulenge refugees insisted on returning to the DRC from 
Burundi sooner than planned.  Their arrival at the 
Congo-Burundi border provoked riots by Congolese citizens in 
Uvira, during which the sites prepared for the eventual 
return of the refugees were burned, Monuc vehicles were 
stoned and Monuc personnel threatened.  Although UNHCR 
initially wanted to force the refugees to return to Burundi 
(where, UNHCR believed, they would be safer), reason 
eventually prevailed.  The refugees are now in a two secure 
sites in Uvira, protected both by Congolese military and 
Monuc.  Although it seems clear that the refugees, and their 
cause, are being manipulated by various political elements, 
it is important that the international community be seen to 
uphold the right of Congolese citizens to return to their own 
country.  End Summary. 
 
A Series of Bad Decisions 
 
2. (C)  Particularly in the wake of the Gatumba massacre, 
many actors -- including UNHCR, Monuc and the Congolese 
government -- had been discussing the future of the 
Banyamulenge (ethnic Tutsi Congolese) refugees.  In the 
immediate aftermath of the killings, the survivors had been 
housed in a local Burundian school while UNHCR negotiated 
their possible relocation to a Burundian site near the 
Tanzanian border.  The refugees, however, resisted this 
proposal, as they did not want to be so far from their homes 
in South Kivu.  Efforts by UNHCR and Monuc to negotiate the 
refugees\' return to the DRC, however, met a cold welcome from 
local authorities, who pointed to a series of difficult 
questions involving ownership of homes and land, jobs, and 
general security as reasons to delay the Banyamulenge return. 
 A September 22 decision by local Burundian authorities to 
evict the refugees from the school (so that students could 
resume classes) provoked a mini-crisis, however, as the 
refugees took matters into their own hands.  Moderate 
Banyamulenge leader Enock Ruberangabo told PolCouns September 
23 that about 200 refugees decided to go to Rwanda (and were 
moving that way on foot), another approximately 150 moved 
spontaneously deeper into Burundi (destination unknown), 
while the majority (about 700) determined to return to the 
DRC.  The first 350 arrived at the border crossing at Uvira 
the evening of September 23 and were refused entry by local 
Congolese military (Mai Mai).  According to both Enock and 
Monuc, the group then moved to the border crossing at 
Kaminyola, where they successfully crossed (with Monuc 
assistance), and Monuc facilitated their return by vehicles 
to Uvira. 
 
Violent -- and Possibly Organized -- Reaction 
 
3. (C)  As word of the refugees\' return began to circulate in 
Uvira, two separate groups of demonstrators converged on 
Monuc\'s offices, throwing stones and besieging the personnel. 
 The vehicles carrying the refugees were diverted to a site 
near the border crossing, where the refugees were deposited. 
The demonstrators, shouting anti-Banyamulenge and anti-Monuc 
slogans, tried to move toward the area where the refugees had 
been left, but Monuc troops deterred them.  The two sites 
which UNHCR had prepared for the eventual return of the 
refugees were burned by the demonstrators.  Unrest continued, 
albeit at a lower level, September 25, but the city returned 
to calm September 26.  Regional military commander Budja Mabe 
addressed the citizens in Uvira September 26, urging calm, 
although Monuc observers noted that he pointedly did not say 
anything which could be construed as welcoming the return of 
these Congolese citizens.  Although UNHCR Kinshasa chief told 
poloff and polcouns that Ministry of Interior officials were 
being unhelpful in the crisis, the vice-Minister of Interior 
was dispatched to Uvira September 25 and remains there now, 
working on local reconciliation and logistics for the return 
of the remaining 300-plus refugees.  A clearly frustrated and 
angry Enock (whose wife is among the returning refugees) 
cautioned polcouns that efforts by some extremists to incite 
violence against the refugees and prohibit the return of the 
Banyamulenge is fueling anger and resentment among the 
Banymaulenge community, particularly the youth, and driving 
many of them into the hands of Colonel Eric, who both Enock 
and Muller (a Banyamulenge activist and founder of the Parti 
Force Repubican, recently returned to the DRC after a 
voluntary exile in France) said is actively arming and 
organizing a \"Banyamulenge self-defense force.\"  (Bio note: 
The reference is to the infamous Colonel Eric, supposedly of 
Rwandan extraction, who has been involved for some time in 
various forms of unrest in eastern Congo, particularly in 
South Kivu.  He was a member of former governor Chiribanya\'s 
militia, played a role in Nkunda\'s attack on Bukavu, and most 
recently has reportedly been recruiting -- both with cash and 
force -- Banyamulenge to form a military element.  End Note.) 
 
4. (C)  SRSG Swing told Ambassador September 26 that 
President Kabila and (Banyamulenge) VP Ruberwa had been 
working together to find a solution to the refugee situation. 
 Both reportedly agreed that the situation had been 
mishandled, but (most importantly) that there could be no 
question of the right of these Congolese citizens to return 
to their own country.  Therefore the Congolese military had 
been ordered to break up new protests by firing into the air, 
and to protect the refugees, who have been moved to two 
locations in Uvira.  Both sites are being protected by an 
outer perimeter of Congolese military, with an inner 
perimeter of Monuc security forces.  UNHCR, Monuc and 
Congolese authorities continue to discuss how to handle the 
group, including the provision of food, safe locations and 
other necessary support. 
Comment 
 
5. (C)  It seems clear that the refugees -- and their 
situation -- are being manipulated by various elements.  We 
doubt that their return is quite as spontaneous as Enock and 
others would like it to appear, particularly given Enock\'s 
comments that \"4,000 non-Banyamulenge refugees had no trouble 
coming back, why should we be any different?\"  The RCD 
vice-Governor of South Kivu had, in fact, accompanied the 
refugees as far as the border while at the same time, the 
province\'s second (PPRD) vice-Governor had been urging a 
cautious, go-slow policy on refugee return. It probably is 
fair to say that most Congolese authorities have been almost 
over-emphasizing the potential difficulties involved in the 
refugees\' return, and generally dragging their feet.  Our 
experience has been that demonstrations such as those in 
Uvira normally are staged by some political element, in this 
case most likely anti-Banyamulenge extremists.  Now that the 
refugees are here, however, we believe it is important that 
the international community -- and the transition government 
-- be seen to be supporting the right of Congolese citizens 
to return to their own country.

SUBJECT: ITURI\'S DISARMAMENT PLAN LAUNCHED BUT MILITIAS 
RELUCTANT TO PARTICIPATE 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. The UN and the GDRC launched Ituri\'s 
disarmament plan September 1st. Very few people have visited 
the transit sites since they opened, however, and only a 
handful of those have turned in their weapons. Militia 
leaders such as Jerome Kakawave are demanding full 
integration of their forces into the Congolese army instead 
of disarmament. MONUC is facilitating discussions between the 
government and the militias to find a compromise involving 
integration of top officers in exchange for militia 
participation in the disarmament plan. End Summary. 
 
Ituri\'s Disarmament: The Plan 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The UN and the GDRC launched Ituri\'s Disarmament and 
Community Reinsertion Plan (DCR) September 1st. Under the DCR 
plan, combatants from Ituri armed groups will need to gather 
into five transit sites for disarmament, registration, and 
selection for either reintegration into the community or 
future participation in a national army. The armed groups 
that have agreed to participate and their assigned transit 
sites are as follow: 
 
-Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC), Iga Barriere/Nizi 
-Front for National Integration (FNI), Kpwandroma 
-People\'s Armed Forces of Congo (FAPC) and the Popular Force 
for Democracy in Congo (FPDC), Mahagi 
-Patriotic Force of Resistance in Ituri (FRPI), Aveba 
-Party for Unity and Safeguarding of the Integrity of Congo 
(PUSIC), Kasenyi 
 
3. (U) MONUC will provide security at the transit sites and 
an integrated unit of the Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) will 
disarm the combatants. A UNDP volunteer will coordinate 
humanitarian activities, while an NGO will be responsible for 
managing the transit site. Upon entering the camp, each 
combatant will receive civilian clothes, food, a blanket, 
utensils and hygiene items. When departing, former combatants 
will be given a month\'s worth of food, a domestic kit with 
household items, a production kit with mostly agricultural 
items and a $50 transportation allowance to get home. 
 
Reality on the Ground: Militias Reluctant to Participate 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
4. (SBU) According to MONUC sources, militias, especially 
that led by Jerome Kakawave, have been reluctant to 
participate in plan DCR. Jerome and other militia leaders 
have recently begun claiming that the GDRC promised them full 
integration of their militias into the army and therefore no 
disarmament will take place unless this promise is honored. 
MONUC notes that the engagement act signed between the GDRC 
and the militia leaders on May 14, 2004 did not include such 
a promise. In order to enlist Jerome\'s group as well as 
ensure the participation of other armed groups, however, 
MONUC is now facilitating talks between the GDRC and the 
militias to incorporate some of their officers in the 
Congolese army. 
 
5. (SBU) A Bunia NGO source told poloff September 25 that 
people in Ituri are skeptical about the DCR plan. He said 
that only a handful of people have gone to the disarmament 
centers since they opened in early September, and that most 
of them had not brought any of their weapons with them. 
PUSIC\'s Chief Khawa Mandro told a Bunia NGO recently that 
MONUC had nothing to offer them at this point through this 
disarmament plan. (Comment: The Hemas from the Lake Albert 
region who constitute PUSIC have long been distrustful of the 
Lendu/Ngiti militias and are unlikely to disarm unless they 
are convinced that these militias will disarm at the same 
time. End Comment.) 
 
6. (SBU) MONUC points to the September 19th attack by Ngiti 
militias against Bira civilians in the village of Lembo (10 
kms South of Bunia) as evidence of the strong need for 
disarmament in Ituri. During this ethnically motivated 
attack, 300-400 Ngiti militias killed approximately 16 people 
and burned many Bira homes. MONUC characterized this attack 
as an act of revenge based on local factors unrelated to 
other groups in Ituri. Following this incident, Petronille 
Vaweka, Ituri\'s District Commissioner, helped mediate a 
dialogue between leaders of both communities. According to 
her, they agreed not to engage in further confrontations and 
to solve future problems peacefully. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) The Ituri militias\' commitment to disarmament has 
long been questionable. Despite the Engagement Act they 
signed in Kinshasa, they now argue the GDRC promised full 
integration of their members into the Congolese army. Such a 
promise is not contained in the accord they signed and it is 
unlikely that the GDRC would have orally agreed to full 
integration of the estimated 15,000 militia members in Ituri. 
Current negotiations between the GDRC and the militias could 
lead to the integration of some of the top militia officers 
into FARDC. It is unlikely this will be enough to persuade 
them to participate in the DCR plan.

DETERMINED THAT THE EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN NEEDS 
BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE WAR OF 1998-2003 CONTINUE, AND 
THAT THE CRISIS IS OF SIGNIFICANT MAGNITUDE TO WARRANT 
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S CONTINUED ASSISTANCE IN FY 2005. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF DRC HAS ESTABLISHED A NEW MINISTRY OF 
HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS TO ASSIST INTERNATIONAL 
HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES IN COORDINATING EMERGENCY 
ASSISTANCE. MISSION AND ITS FIELD PARTNERS APPRECIATE 
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S CONTRIBUTIONS IN FY 2004. THIS 
ASSISTANCE HELPED SIGNIFICANTLY TO ALLEVIATE THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR FOR PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE 
POPULATIONS. MISSION REQUESTS THAT OFDA FUNDING BE 
CONTINUED. END SUMMARY. 
2. (U) THE CHIEF OF MISSION HEREBY DETERMINES THAT THE 
COMPLEX HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY IN DRC BROUGHT ABOUT BY 
THE WAR WHICH STARTED IN AUGUST 1998, CONTINUES TO BE 
OF SIGNIFICANT MAGNITUDE TO WARRANT U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S 
ASSISTANCE IN FY 2005. CONTINUED OFDA FUNDING IS 
THEREFORE REQUESTED. 
3. (U) THE WAR RESULTED IN THE DISPLACEMENT OF OVER 2 
MILLION CIVILIANS AND PARALYZED BASIC SOCIAL SERVICES 
(HEALTH, EDUCATION AND SANITATION) IN THE EASTERN PARTS 
OF THE COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS.  IT DISRUPTED 
AN ALREADY WEAK TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
AGGRAVATED THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF MILLIONS OF CONGOLESE. 
ALTHOUGH THE WAR IS OFFICIALLY OVER AND A NEW 
TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT IS IN PLACE, INSECURITY 
CONTINUES IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY DUE TO THE 
EXISTENCE OF ARMED GROUPS NOT PARTY TO THE PEACE 
PROCESS. EVEN IN AREAS HAVING SEEN A RETURN OVER THE 
PAST YEAR TO RELATIVE STABILITY, THE HUMANITARIAN 
SITUATION WILL IMPROVE ONLY SLOWLY. MISSION ANTICIPATES 
THAT DISASTER ASSISTANCE FUNDS WILL BE NEEDED THROUGH 
FY 2005 IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF 
INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS), RETURNING IDPS, 
AND OTHER WAR-AFFECTED VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. 
4. (U) UNDER THE TRANSITIONAL CONSTITUTION, A NEW 
MINISTRY OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND SOLIDARITY HAS 
BEEN CREATED.  HOWEVER, MISSION BELIEVES THAT THE ON- 
GOING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IS BEYOND THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
OWN CAPACITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY. ON SEVERAL 
OCCASIONS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE APPEALED TO DONORS 
AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR ASSISTANCE TO WAR- 
STRICKEN POPULATIONS. MISSION ALSO BELIEVES IT IS IN 
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S INTEREST TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE TO THOSE MOST AFFECTED BY THE WAR. 
5. (U) MISSION AND ITS FIELD PARTNERS APPRECIATE THE 
U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S CONTRIBUTIONS IN FY 2004. THIS 
ASSISTANCE HELPED SIGNIFICANTLY TO ALLEVIATE THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR FOR THE ASSISTED POPULATIONS. 
IN FY 2004, USG FUNDS WERE USED TO SECURE SEEDS AND 
TOOLS FOR RETURNEE POPULATIONS ATTEMPTING TO RESTART 
THEIR LIVES, FOR SHELTER AND BASIC NON-FOOD ITEMS FOR 
IDPS, AND FOR PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FOR POPULATIONS IN 
THE MOST WAR-AFFECTED HEALTH ZONES.  USG FUNDS WERE 
ALSO USED TO REOPEN THE CRITICAL RAILROAD LINE BETWEEN 
LUBUMBASHI AND KINDU, GREATLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE FOOD 
SECURITY OF POPULATIONS THAT HAD REMAINED ISOLATED FOR 
THE DURATION OF THE WAR.  USG FUNDS CONTINUE TO PLAY 
THE CRITICAL ROLE OF PROVIDING SUBSIDIZED AIR 
TRANSPORTATION FOR NGOS REACHING DIFFICULT-TO-ACCESS 
AREAS TO DELIVER RELIEF SUPPLIES.

SUBJECT: RCD: SOME STILL SEARCHING FOR REASONS TO ABANDON 
THE TRANSITION 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1311 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 1. (C)  Summary:  Bizima Karaha, one of the RCD-G\'s most 
well-known extremists, told Ambassador September 23 that the 
transition has failed, implying that another mechanism should 
be found.  Ambassador reiterated strongly our message that 
the transition, while flawed, remains the sole available 
vehicle through which peace can be maintained and the 
Congolese people\'s interests advanced.  Karaha also repeated 
the oft-heard RCD demand that Congolese military elements 
deployed in the Kivus must be withdrawn and the government 
cease supporting the Interahamwe. Ambassador also raised the 
importance of ending the climate of impunity which has partly 
enabled the cycle of violence plaguing the DRC.  End Summary. 
 
An Extremist Flexing His Muscles 
 
2. (C)  As recently as late-May of this year, Bizima Karaha 
was on the outs with RCD-G president Azarias Ruberwa, and 
indeed, had retreated, together with seven like-minded party 
colleagues, to a sort of exile in Goma.  (Note:  Karaha and 
the \"group of seven\" had disregarded Ruberwa\'s instructions 
on key votes, had publicly misspoken themselves in the 
Parliament, and as a consequence, Ruberwa had sent a letter 
to National Assembly President Kamitatu removing the eight 
from their RCD-appointed seats, a decision which prompted 
their disgruntled move east (ref).  End Note.)  In the wake 
of the Gatumba massacre, however, Karaha and others have 
recast themselves as among Ruberwa\'s close advisors -- 
although other party members have characterized Bizima more 
as a thorn in Ruberwa\'s side, or even as his \"Rwandan 
jailor.\"  In any event, his star within the party seems on 
the rise, and many of his previously disregarded statements 
have emerged as policy demands underpinning the RCD\'s return 
to the transitional government.  During his September 23 
meeting with Ambassador (a meeting which Karaha requested), 
he struck some familiar chords, including: 
 
-- the RCD is afraid that the transition will end with many 
promises unmet; it is seriously behind schedule and little is 
being done to put things right; these current negative trends 
have serious implications for the future; 
 
-- there has been no progress on military integration, which 
is key to progress on improving social services, installing 
democracy and holding elections; worse, there is no interest 
by the Congolese participants in making progress on these 
issues; 
 
-- President Kabila doesn\'t act like a national leader, but 
instead tolerates hate media and makes promises that aren\'t 
kept; 
 
-- therefore, given all the hidden agendas, the lack of 
Congolese ownership of the processes and general bad faith, 
the transition has failed. 
 
3. (C)  Karaha went on to reiterate another well-known RCD 
complaint, namely that the current deployment of government 
and MLC troops to the East is promoting uncontrolled 
fighting, exacerbating general instability, prohibiting the 
return of refugees, and generally making more difficult any 
move toward \"real\" military integration, since the current 
brassage (\"mixing\") of troop elements as seen in the East is 
forced and unnatural, and will lead different elements to 
turn on each other.  He concluded by accusing the government 
of continuing to support the Interahamwe, and indeed of 
having integrated some elements into the military, including 
in the personal bodyguard of South Kivu regional military 
commander Mabe. 
 
Transition Flawed, But Necessary 
 
4. (C)  In response, the Ambassador noted that no one had 
expected the transition to function perfectly; it is an 
ungainly conglomeration but the only means by which the 
ex-combatants can be brought to work together.  Undeniably, 
progress has been slower than we and the international 
community had hoped, and much remains to be done.  Flawed 
though it is, however, the transition remains the best and 
only means by which to reach the shared goal of free, fair 
and democratic elections, and to protect and advance the 
rights and interests of all the Congolese people.  We must 
all work with what we have available, and that is the 
transition.  Military integration and the related issues of 
demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants are 
complicated issues in which the international community 
perhaps could usefully play a better coordinated role. 
Nonetheless, in this area there also is positive movement, 
seen in meetings of the Supreme Military Council and renewed 
activity by the international community.  The Ambassador 
reminded Karaha that the mere existence of the CIAT (the 
International Committee to Accompany the Transition) is an 
unprecedented example of international interest in,and 
coordination with, the DRC. 
 
5. (C)  The Ambassador said that another complicated but 
important priority is addressing the climate of impunity 
which has enabled the cyle of violence plaguing the Congo. 
While the GDRC\'s request to the ICC may be a part of the 
answer, there are other avenues as well to address 
allegations that date back a number of years.  The Ambassador 
went on to note that, as for the problem of the Interahamwe 
presence, the actions of (RCD) renegade commander Nkunda and 
the presence of his troops have essentially stymied very 
promising voluntary repatriation of Interahamwe elements 
facilitated by Monuc which, pre-Nkunda, had successfully 
moved over 14,000 FDLR and their families back to Rwanda. 
Post-Nkunda, the number of voluntary repatriations has fallen 
to practically zero.  He concluded by noting that clearly it 
is in the interest of both the DRC and its neighbors, 
particularly Rwanda, to put an end to the menace of the 
Interahamwe, and to support disarmament and relocation 
programs. 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C)  On the way out of the building, out of earshot of 
others, Karaha noted to the Ambassador that he had applied 
for a visa but had been told he needed to wait for some time 
before receiving and answer (note: e.g., a security advisory 
opinion).  He asked if there is a problem.  The Ambassador 
replied that he did not track individual visa cases, but 
underscored that in all cases, procedures standardized at all 
U.S. Embassies needed to be followed. 
 
7. (C)  Karaha may, in part, have come to hear for himself 
the U.S. reaction to his \"the transition is dead\" line.  Or 
he may simply have been fishing to see if his failure to 
obtain a visa immeidately signaled bigger problems with the 
U.S.  Alternatively, Ruberwa may have encouraged Karaha to 
hear for himself that the U.S. doesn\'t accept that the 
transition is dead, in hopes that he will modify his stance. 
The latter, however, would be a vain hope, since by all 
accounts Karaha is the embodiment of RCD-G hard-core 
positions, and widely perceived to be a close Kigali ally. 
Karaha\'s comments, however, make painfully clear how very 
little manuevering room Ruberwa has, particularly since, 
having chosen to retreat to Goma in the wake of Gatumba, he 
has made himself more susceptible, at least in the 
short-term, to Karaha\'s and other hard-line factional 
influences.

SUBJECT: PETROLEUM SHORTAGES IN KATANGA 
 
1. Summary.  Petroleum shortages resulting from Zambia 
closing its border to exports are affecting the Katanga 
region, home to most of the DRC\'s copper and cobalt mining. 
Poor transportation infrastructure and an inefficient 
parastatal petroleum company leave the GDRC unable to supply 
the region from other parts of the country.  End Summary. 
 
2. DRC petroleum parastatal Cohydro has no refinery or 
reliable system of transportation to supply the south-east of 
the country.  Cohydro has regularly imported petroleum from 
Zambia, Tanzania, and South Africa to meet local demand. 
Most imports are funneled through Zambia to the DRC border 
crossing at Kasumbalesa. 
 
3. Approximately two weeks ago, the Zambian government closed 
its border to all petroleum imports into the DRC.  (Note: The 
border was closed to all petroleum imports regardless of 
their country of origin.  End Note.)  Zambian authorities 
cited an increase in smuggling and claimed that Zambian 
refineries were only producing enough petroleum to meet 
Zambian demand.  (Note:  Last year, Zambian officials 
prevented 150 truckloads of petroleum from crossing into the 
DRC, demanding payment of USD 100 per truckload.  The 
truckers refused to pay, and the matter was only resolved 
after bilateral talks between the DRC and Zambia.  While some 
tension still exists regarding the issue of petroleum 
imports, post does not believe this to have affected the 
recent Zambian decision to close the border.  End Note.) 
 
4. In the past two weeks, petroleum supplies in Lubumbashi 
have dwindled.  Local mining sector sources report that there 
is currently no jet A1 fuel or gasoline available, and that 
diesel fuel is being rationed at 10 liters per day.  (Note: 
MONUC has a contract with Shell to supply its forces in the 
area with gasoline and diesel fuel.  Shell flies these 
supplies into Lubumbashi, leaving MONUC unaffected by the 
shortage.  End Note.)

SUBJECT: MOBUTU\'S HOMETOWN OF GBADOLITE \"THE MOST FORGOTTEN 
CITY IN THE CONGO\" 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. A visit to Gbadolite in northern Equateur 
Province showed a region suffering substantial decay, massive 
poverty and serious neglect by the national government. 
Although security had improved with the departure of large 
numbers of MLC soldiers for the east, abuses by remaining 
soldiers continued. Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba and his 
MLC party were unpopular with the local population, despite 
the fact that this area is Bemba\'s stronghold. Demobilization 
of child soldiers in Gbadolite started recently, but has run 
into obstacles due to lack of resources and expertise on the 
part of local NGO\'s running the program. End Summary. 
 
Gbadolite Longs for the \"Glory Days\" of Mobutu 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (U) Poloff visited Gbadolite September 18 to evaluate the 
current situation in the area. He stayed at the once 
exclusive Ndekele Hotel owned by Joseph Mobutu, currently in 
a state of decay and disrepair. The Ndekele\'s cracked and 
empty swimming pool, peeling walls and broken fixtures are 
representative of the general condition of Gbadolite, once 
the site of Mobutu\'s favorite retreat in the Congo. Mobutu\'s 
luxurious Chinese palace and his main mansion in the city lay 
in ruins, looted and overgrown by tall grass. The Coca Cola 
factory, which ceased production in 1999, lay idle, and the 
vast African palm oil plantation Mobutu owned in Gbadolite 
was overgrown with vegetation. 
 
3. (U) The only signs of recent progress visible in the city 
are the new offices of Vodacom and Celtel communications. A 
weekly flight by Wimbi Dira Airlines keeps Gbadolite linked 
to Kinshasa, although goods flown from Kinshasa cost two to 
three times more in Gbadolite. Trade with the nearby Central 
African Republic is minimal due to cumbersome border fees 
paid by local merchants and theft by remaining MLC soldiers 
(Note: Local officials indicated that the border has been 
open only once or twice a month for trade. End Note.) 
Subsistence agriculture of crops such as rice, manioc, corn 
and peanuts is the main economic activity in the area. There 
is also some level of fishing and cattle raising, although 
most cattle were killed during the war. The main roads around 
the city, however, were actually in good condition and a 
local hydroelectric plant produced sufficient electricity to 
supply the city and its outlying areas. 
 
4. (SBU) A visit to a Belgian-built hospital 13 miles from 
Gbadolite showed empty shells of buildings, a rusting 
operating room in which a medical assistant without any 
formal training had just performed a cesarean section on a 
patient who, to our surprise, had survived the procedure. The 
hospital had a handful of unpaid staff and no medicines or 
equipment to speak of. A Catholic nun explained that 
malnutrition was rampant and that although Medicinis Sans 
Frontieres-Belgium (MSF) was present in Gbabolite, their 
assistance was limited and most people in the region lacked 
access to health care. (Note: MSF was the only international 
NGO that we found in the area. End Note.) The same nun noted 
that school attendance outside Gbadolite was well under 50% 
due to parents\' inability to pay school fees. 
 
Bemba\'s MLC Unpopular with Locals 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Members of civil society, NGO\'s and local officials 
expressed relief over the departure of a significant number 
of soldiers from Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s Movement for the 
Liberation of Congo (MLC) to the east. They estimate that out 
of approximately 7,000 soldiers deployed in the area prior to 
August, only 600-800 remained. Local NGO\'s said that MLC 
soldiers had caused substantial insecurity for the local 
population, stealing harvests and destroying agricultural 
fields and raping women at will. Such abuses had a 
detrimental effect on agriculture, as farmers did not want to 
harvest only to essentially feed MLC soldiers. 
 
6. (SBU) While poloff was in Gbadolite, Vice-President Jean 
Pierre Bemba made a brief visit to the city, but did not meet 
with any local officials. He spent 30 minutes in his private 
residence and then left the area. Civil society 
representatives said that the MLC had not done anything for 
the province and that Bemba was not popular in Gbadolite, the 
MLC\'s former base. The mayor of Gbadolite referred to 
Gbadolite as \"the most forgotten city in the Congo\" and noted 
that local people had lost faith in the national authorities 
and that the region had yet to see any tangible benefits from 
the transitional institutions. According to him, five 
political parties are already present in Gbadolite: the MLC, 
the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-G), the People\'s 
Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD), and the 
Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR). 
 
Demobilization of Child Soldiers Faces Challenges 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
7. (SBU) Poloff visited two centers for the demobilization of 
child soldiers run by local NGO\'s in Gbadolite. The 
demobilization of child soldiers in the area started on 
September 1st. The initial idea involved housing over 120 of 
these children in one center. Within the first two days, 
these children had threatened a journalist who visited them 
and attacked a local teenager. At this point they were 
divided into two groups of 60 and placed in two separate 
centers. Although there were no credible reports of further 
problems with the local population, the demobilized child 
soldiers looked restless and angry. (Comment: Some local 
activists voiced concern about the lack of expertise on the 
part of the NGO\'s running the demobilization program. Indeed, 
poloff did not see any evidence of the availability of 
professional staff such as psychologists who could conduct 
anger-management sessions for children who openly displayed 
high levels of frustration during our visit. End Comment.) 
 
8. (SBU) The NGO\'s running these centers want to reintegrate 
children into their communities. Most children, however, come 
from different parts of the Congo and the process of family 
reunification could take some time. In the meantime, the 
children are being sensitized about community reintegration 
and civilian life. The children themselves told poloff that 
they were angry at not having received any pay from the 
government after several years of military service. Most said 
that they came from very poor families and did not want to go 
home empty-handed; many were anxious to start school and felt 
that the centers did not have enough activities for them. 
(Comment: Poloff raised the issue of school attendance with 
the NGO\'s, but they said they did not have the funds to 
provide for education at this time. Since most children will 
likely spend several months in these centers, this will be an 
ongoing source of frustration and a potential problem for the 
NGO\'s and the surrounding communities. End Comment.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (SBU) The Gbadolite region faces many of the same problems 
experienced by other regions of the Congo following five 
years of war: massive unemployment, insecurity resulting from 
unpaid soldiers who prey on the rural population, and lack of 
government support for basic services such as health and 
education. Gbadolite, like other parts of Equateur Province, 
however, has received less attention from international NGO\'s 
and UN agencies, whose primary focus remains the East. The 
transition government is unlikely to provide significant 
support to the region in the foreseeable future. With 
thousands of Congolese refugees expected to return to 
northern Equateur Province from the CAR and Congo-Brazzaville 
in the next several months, it will be important for the 
international community to pay attention to the humanitarian 
situation in the area, before it, and security, deteriorate 
further.

SUBJECT: IMF TEAM HELPS GDRC DRAFT 2005 BUDGET 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but Unclassified. 
 
2. (U) Summary. An IMF team led by Director For Africa Cyril 
Brianson visited Congo the week of September 13 to assist in 
the preparation of the DRC\'s 2005 budget. The team noted that 
most macroeconomic indicators continue to be on target; that, 
encouragingly, government revenues have increased over the 
last year; that funding for elections and military 
integration are to be included in the budget sent to 
Parliament; and that the budget process is being hindered by 
questions of when the USG will appropriate sufficient funds 
to implement HIPC debt forgiveness. The IMF will return to 
Kinshasa in November for a program review that is expected to 
overlap with the Consultative Group meeting. End summary. 
 
3. (U) Ambassador, DCM and Econoff met with IMF Director for 
Africa Cyril Brianson, IMF resrep Arend Kouwenaar, and Senior 
Economist Jacob Gons (who was Kouwenaar\'s immediate 
predecessor as resrep) on September 20 to discuss the current 
budget mission and other IMF topics.  The IMF 
representatives, who came to Congo at the request of the GDRC 
to assist in the preparation of the budget, told Post that 
the draft budget is less than 50 percent financed by the 
revenues of the Congolese state.  The rest is to come from 
outside sources - multilateral and bilateral donors.  The 
budget is slightly more than one billion USD, with the GDRC 
contribution at USD 450 million.  OFIDA (the customs service) 
has experienced steadily increasing revenues.  Encouragingly, 
government revenues increased 32.8 percent from 2003 to 2004. 
 While revenues are still low by any standard, the increase 
is a positive indicator of both growing commercial activity 
as well as reflecting progress on ongoing reforms in the 
state revenue structures.  The Ambassador noted the need to 
balance the necessity of increasing state revenue to some 
adequate level with a corresponding decrease in payment 
demands on the formal sector, much of which represents 
unauthorized free-agent demands by inadequately supported 
offices and individuals.  This remains a problem that has 
impeded legitimate business growth in the DRC.  The IMF 
official indicated they were aware of and sensitive to the 
issue. 
 
4.  (U) The team noted that the key issue is that the 
approved budget must be implemented by the government to be 
effective.  In 2004, for example expenses for \"institutions\" 
(the president and 4 vice-presidents) were over budget while 
health and education spending were under budget.  Brianson 
noted that pro-poor spending shortfalls were not unique to 
the Congo and that many governments did not have procedures 
in place to spend money newly available under the terms of 
HIPC. 
 
5.  (U) The IMF team asked about the status of the HIPC debt 
forgiveness by the USG.  The Ambassador advised that we hoped 
that sufficient funding would be appropriated to at least 
cover Congolese debt service over the next year.   Later, 
Kouwenaar called Econoff to express his concern that the US 
was billing the Congo for loan payments coming due under the 
October 2002 Paris Club agreement that had not yet been 
forgiven by the USG.  (Note: Vice President Jean-Pierre 
Bemba, who leads the DRC\'s Economic and Financial Commission, 
will be in Washington from October 3-7.  We expect that he 
will raise the HIPC issue in his meetings with USG officials 
including Treasury Under Secretary Taylor on October 5. End 
note.) 
 
6.  (U) Ambassador Meece noted the importance of budgeting 
for elections, scheduled for June 2005 and also for military 
integration. Brianson acknowledged that these need to be 
priority issues for the GDRC, and indicated that a 
substantial sum (approximately USD 65 million) is likely to 
be included in the 2005 budget for military integration. As 
well, funds are being included for the elections, although 
the IMF officials observed the amount is little more tan 
symbolic relative to total election funding needs  It is 
nonetheless important. 
 
7.  (U) The IMF team will return in mid-November for the 
semi-annual review.  This will coincide with the November 
11-13 Consultative Group meeting to be held again in Kinshasa. 
 
8. (SBU)  Comment. The IMF team made a point to meet with 
donors, both in a group debriefing and bilaterally. Team 
members were forthcoming, open and receptive. Their 
willingness to tackle the issues of funding elections and 
military integration was an important step forward in 
supporting the transition, and represents a welcome change 
from prior IMF apparent reluctance to devote scarce budget 
resources to these areas. Likewise, the GDRC\'s desire to 
collaborate closely with the Fund in preparing its budget it 
to be welcomed. End comment.

SUBJECT: UPDATE ON DRC SUIT AGAINST UGANDA AND RWANDA IN 
THE ICJ 
 
 1. (SBU)  The GDROC filed suit in the International Court of 
Justice (ICJ) in 1998 against both Rwanda and Uganda, 
demanding compensation for those two countries\' military and 
economic interference in the eastern part of the Congo (North 
and South Kivu Provinces and Oriental Province, 
respectively).  Rwanda has chosen to ignore the suit, but the 
Ugandan government acknowledged it.  As recently as February 
2004, Uganda asked the DRC to drop the suit in favor of 
diplomatic negotiations to establish some form of 
compensation.  Local press articles October 2 and 4 noted 
that this issue apparently is again active, although the 
articles confined themselves to reiterating the history of 
how the suit came to be filed. 
 
2. (SBU)  PolCouns spoke October 2 with officials at the 
Ministry of Justice and in the Presidency, who said that the 
GDROC has just decided to apply to the ICJ to temporarily 
suspend (not/not drop) the suit, in order to facilitate 
compensation negotiations with Uganda.  The Ministry official 
indicated that the suspension requested is for 90 days, 
although he wasn\'t sure if the ICJ authorized such short 
suspensions. 
 
3. (SBU)  Comment:  A successful Uganda-Congo settlement of 
this issue may increase pressure on Rwanda to likewise try to 
reach a settlement, although, given that Rwanda has not even 
acknowledged the ICJ jurisdiction, such a settlement remains 
highly unlikely.

AND NOVEMBER UNSC VISIT TO KINSHASA 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROGER MEECE.  REASON 1.5 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The International Committee to Accompany the 
Transition (CIAT) met October 4 to prepare for a pending and 
unprecedented meeting with the President, Vice Presidents and 
other senior officials to review the transition road map and 
discuss military integration and election-related 
legislation.  This meeting will also pave the way for a UNSC 
mission to Kinshasa expected in November.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) The 18 members of the International Committee to 
Accompany the Transition (CIAT) met the morning of October 4 
to prepare for a meeting expected in the near future with 
President Kabila, all four Vice Presidents, the leaders of 
the National Assembly and Senate, and the heads of five 
civilian \"institutions to support democracy\" (Independent 
Electoral Commission, High Media Authority, Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, Ethics and Anti-Corruption 
Commission, Human Rights Commission).  A meeting of this 
nature has long been requested by the CIAT as an appropriate 
forum for the CIAT to discuss major issues with the most 
senior representatives of all rival components participating 
in the transition government.  Given the mutual mistrust 
existing among the various leaders and groups, however, it 
has been difficult to arrange.  The projected meeting will 
therefore set a precedent. 
 
3. (C) The CIAT decided that the major items to be proposed 
for the agenda will be questions related to army integration 
and related questions of demobilization, and the legislative 
status of specific important bills needed to proceed with 
election planning.  Two lists of \"indicated questions\" on 
these topics are to be submitted as early as tomorrow, 
October 4, to the GDRC members expected to participate in the 
meeting to guide discussions.  Both lists of questions are 
based in the overall transition \"road map\" plan guiding the 
transition.  The CIAT also reviewed and concurred with the 
latest revision of the road map, and a copy of that document 
is also to be submitted to the GDRC officials in advance of 
the meeting.  (Note: Septel to cover the road map). 
 
4. (C) CIAT members were divided as to whether to press 
during this initial meeting for regularly scheduled future 
meetings with the \"Espace Presidentiel.\"  After some 
discussion, it was decided that it would be better for now 
simply to note that the meeting will be useful as groundwork 
for a UNSC visit to Kinshasa which is being planned for the 
latter half of November.  It is envisaged that some similar 
broad and senior-level meeting would be appropriate for the 
visiting UNSC members next month. 
 
5. (C) Comment: The planned meeting will address at least in 
part concerns expressed by various observers, reportedly 
including during discussions held at the recent senior-level 
CIAT member meeting in New York, regarding an institutional 
interlocutor for the CIAT.  It is unlikely nonetheless to be 
a comfortable meeting, with the four Vice Presidents, for 
example, deeply mistrustful of each other and largely of 
President Kabila.  It is all the more reason to get difficult 
topics like military integration on the table with all the 
former belligerents in the same room.  The reported planned 
UNSC mission could be a very positive move to help spur 
further positive movement in Kinshasa.  November, however, is 
shaping up to be a busy month, with a Consultative Group 
meeting planned for November 11 - 13, a francophonie summit 
in Burkina Faso November 19, and an IMF review mission during 
the month. End comment.

International Committee to Accompany the Transition (CIAT) 
October 4 that he is leaving Kinshasa later the same day for 
travel to Kigali in preparation for convening the first 
meeting of the Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM) tomorrow, 
October 5, in the border area.  Swing noted that the Rwandan 
delegation to this first JVM meeting will be headed by 
Ambassador Richard Sezibera; the GDRC delegation will be

2. (U) The JVM agreement was reached two weeks ago per terms 
of reference prepared by the U.N. in New York following 
receipt of proposed changes to an earlier draft from the 
Kigali government.  All Congolese officials with whom emboffs 
have spoken have expressed satisfaction at getting the JVM 
off the ground and operating. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  Ghonda is heading the Congolese delegation 
in his new capacity as Ambassador-at-large in the Presidency. 
 He was appointed to the job a little over a week ago by 
President Kabila following his removal as Foreign Minister by 
opposition MLC leader Jean-Pierre Bemba.  Ghonda continues to 
enjoy Kabila,s confidence, although Bemba and MLC leaders 
are deeply unhappy by the new Ghonda appointment. 
Officially, Ghonda has not yet resigned from the MLC. 
President Kabila and just about all Congolese leaders have 
been saying for months that they want to the JVM to start 
operating as soon as possible, and this first meeting is 
welcome in GDRC offices as well as by MONUC as a positive 
move forward.   End comment.

SUBJECT: MINISTER OF PLAN AND PHELPS-DODGE MINING PROJECT 
 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.4 b/d 
 
1.  (C) Ambassador and econoff met with Minister of Plan 
Alexis Thambwe on September 27 for an introductory meeting 
and to discuss Phelps-Dodge\'s mining project at Tenke 
Fungurume.  Thambwe told the Ambassador that he was committed 
to getting the project off the ground and was asking the 
government to impose an agreement on Gecamines, the 
copper/cobalt mining parastatal. The Ambassador thanked 
Thambwe for his interest in the case and emphasized the 
importance of closing this deal that has been in the works 
for several years. As a major US company and a leader in the 
field of copper mining, Phelps-Dodge is well positioned to 
relaunch mining activity in Katanga and act as a success 
story that will encourage other companies to consider 
investing in this mineral rich country. 
 
2. (C) Thambwe gave the Ambassador a copy of a Sept 24 letter 
which he submitted to Vice President Bemba, head of the 
Economic and Financial Commission. The key points of the 
letter were that Gecamines\' share of the joint venture would 
be reduced from 45 percent to 15 percent in exchange for the 
venture being subject to the tax code.  The 15 percent would 
be the 10 percent that PD was offering plus the 5 percent 
that the mining code reserves to the government ceded to 
Gecamines.  He also included an up-front total payment of USD 
100 million (Note. This does take into account USD 50 million 
already paid by Lundin in 1996/97. Phelps-Dodge would only be 
responsible for the remaining USD 50 million. End Note.) with 
a negotiable payment schedule. He is clearly frustrated with 
Gecamines\' stalling, and Thambwe accuses them of changing 
position without good reason. He asks that the Vice President 
recommend to the President that Gecamines be forced to agree 
as it is 100 percent owned by the Congolese state. 
 
3. (C) Thambwe\'s language regarding Gecamines was very blunt 
and made clear that neither he nor others in the government 
approved of Gecamines\' position or recent threats. These 
threats included requesting the reduction of the Tenke 
Fungurume concession, launch a new open tender for the 
project, and to go to international arbitration to resolve 
the payment of the original fees - which reach a total of USD 
250 million - in the original mining convention. Thambwe 
wrote: 
 
Begin Translation: 
 
The leaders of Gecamines, politically supported and 
manipulated, multiply the hindrances as you can note in 
reading their notes in the annex. 
 
My point of view, expressed in a clear manner, is that the 
Government can settle this dossier in little time if the 
political will to push this project to completion is real. 
The current procrastination around this dossier does not 
profit either our country or Katanga. 
 
In my opinion, it is indispensible to bring this project to 
completion by imposing a point of view on Gecamines, which in 
the present context, is perfectly incapable of re-launching 
this project. 
 
End Translation. 
 
4. (C) Phelps-Dodge previously agreed to a maximum lump-sum 
payment of USD 100 million over a duration reaching the first 
production of copper from the project, but not earlier as it 
would distort project financing and the internal rate of 
return. Phelps-Dodge asked to retain a tax exemption (on a 
tax of 15 percent over dividends) present in the initial 
Lundin-Gecamines Mining Convention of 1996 to compensate for 
lost profit due to the USD 100 million lump-sum payment. 
 
5. (C)  Comment. Thambwe\'s willingness to push this project 
forward is a good thing for both the American firm and the 
economy of Katanga. It is not certain that both sides will 
reach an quick agreement on the lump-sum payment due to 
Phelps-Dodge\'s previous request for tax relief in 
compensation. Gecamines is the largest employer in Katanga 
and was at one time an important foreign currency earner. As 
the GDRC pushes Gecamines to compromise, they must be careful 
not to appear to disregard the rights of the company or they 
may face popular opposition to the project when it finally 
gets started. End comment.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROGER MEECE.  REASON 1.5 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: In an October 4 meeting, the International 
Committee to Accompany the Transition (CIAT) concurred with 
revisions to its version of the DRC transition \"road map,\" 
the fundamental plan for the transition period.  Copies are 
being sent to President Kabila and other senior GDRC 
officials.  The road map focuses on four key areas: army 
restructuring, integration, and disarmament/demobilization; 
foreign armed groups in the DRC; election preparations; and 
extension of state authority to all DRC territory.  The 
revised road map notes steps already accomplished, as well as 
outlining GDRC actions required.  The CIAT document does not 
identify needed international community actions, such as 
efforts to harmonize currently uncoordinated initiatives from 
various countries regarding military integration.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The International Committee to Accompany the 
Transition (CIAT) approved October 4 a revised draft of the 
DRC \"Road Map\" which serves as the base reference document 
for the transition period.  Copies of the document were being 
sent to President Kabila, the four Vice Presidents, and other 
GDRC officials prior to a scheduled meeting of the CIAT with 
the \"Espace Presidentiel\" (President plus four Vice 
Presidents) on October 6.  (Note: Vice President Bemba, 
currently in the U.S. will not be present for the October 6 
meeting.) 
 
3. (SBU) The road map focuses on the four key areas for 
transition progress identified by the international community 
following the conclusion of peace accords establishing the 
transition.  Chapter one looks at \"Integration and 
restructuring of the army, implementation of the national 
plan for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration.\" 
Chapter two focuses on \"Definitive resolution of the problem 
of armed foreign groups in Congolese territory.\"  Chapter 
three deals with \"Preparation and organization of elections,\" 
and Chapter four with \"Extension of State authority 
throughout all national territory.\" 
 
4. (SBU) Each of the chapters has an opening bullet list of 
actions already accomplished.  Chapter one steps, for 
example, include among other items the adoption of a national 
DDR plan, elaboration of an integration plan, launch of the 
High Defense Council (composed of representatives of former 
belligerents), formation of the Ituri integrated military 
brigade, and an integrated police brigade in Bunia (Ituri). 
Chapter two accomplishments list only two bullets to-date, 
establishment of a Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM) between 
the DRC and Uganda, and the voluntary repatriation of 5,000 
combatants plus families.  Chapter three accomplishments 
include the elaboration and adoption of the Independent 
Electoral Commission (CEI) law and the launch of CEI 
operations, and the elaboration of the electoral registration 
law.  Chapter four lists, among others, the installation of 
provincial governors and vice governors, deployment of the 
Ituri Brigade (in process), and the nomination of an Ituri 
territorial administration. 
 
5. (SBU) The list of remaining tasks is, not surprisingly, 
extensive.  In Chapter one, these are divided into separate 
lists dealing with the Army, DDR, Police, and \"others,\" the 
latter category including intelligence services.  Each step 
includes a target time frame for implementation and 
identification of the GDRC authority with lead 
responsibility.  For example, one item identifies 
\"finalization and adoption of a plan of integration and 
restructuring of the Army by the Transition Government\" by 
November 2004, with the High Defense Council listed as the 
lead authority.  Chapter two includes only two tasks, 
specifically \"Implementation of the Pretoria Declaration of 
November 27, 2003 and completion of the JVM accords between 
Rwanda and the DRC\" targeted for October - November, 2004; 
and \"Elaboration by the FARDC (Congolese National Army) of a 
strategy for the disarmament of foreign fighters in RCD - for 
example assignment of integrated units of the FARDC for the 
specific task of supporting DDRRR of foreign fighters\" 
identifying November - December, 2004 as a target date. 
Chapter three tasks are allocated into four categories: 
\"Common core\" (e.g., allocation of funds for the CEI 
elaboration of election and Constitution laws, etc.); 
\"Constitutional Referendum\"; \"Elections (local and 
legislative)\"; and \"Presidential Election.\"  Finally, Chapter 
four includes thorny issues such as the allocation of 
territorial, diplomatic, parastatal, and security service 
senior positions, implementation of a system to ensure 
regular and effective salary payments throughout the country, 
and other issues. 
 
6. (C) The list does not identify tasks or actions needed by 
the international community.  In terms of urgent priorities, 
this includes some degree of harmonization of initiatives of 
various countries, notably including South Africa and 
Belgium, for military integration.  The various plans and 
actions currently on the table at best are not coordinated, 
and are widely perceived to be in at least some respects 
competitive.  With growing recognition of the problem, there 
are efforts underway now to achieve greater coordination, and 
indeed the topic is expected to be one of the primary issues 
to be discussed in the CIAT- Espace Presidentiel meeting 
October 6. 
 
7. (U) A copy of the revised Road Map (in French) is being 
sent to AF/C. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  The road map is useful in maintaining 
pressure on Congolese leaders to realize progress on the key 
elements of the transition, as well as serving a secondary 
purpose of keeping CIAT members on the same page.  The latest 
revision reflects only an update of the basic plan and dates, 
but does not vary significantly from the earlier base line 
plan.  There is reason to be hopeful of progress in the near 
future on the question of harmonizing the disparate 
international initiatives regarding military integration. 
Given the reluctance of many Congolese in the transition to 
move on this issue, the achievement of a largely common 
international community position would be extremely useful to 
increase pressure to ensure timely forward movement.  End 
comment.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROGER MEECE, REASON 1.4 (B/D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: The first-ever meeting of the \"Espace 
Presidentiel\" (President plus four vice presidents) with the 
International Committee to Accompany the Transition (CIAT) 
was held October 6, albeit without Vice President Bemba, 
currently in the U.S.  Discussion focused on the transition 
\"road map\" (reftel), military integration, and election 
preparations.  The military integration discussion noted 
efforts to arrive at a coordinated plan, and an initiative to 
form an integrated \"Kivu Brigade.\"  Concerns about available 
finances and a short preparation time for elections were 
discussed.  Ruberwa presented legally-based concerns about 
the issue of a census, and some of the Congolese comments 
predictably focused on problems of international financial 
support.  Agreement was reached to establish a follow-up 
committee, and to consider the establishment of 
sub-committees, as well as future full Espace Presidentiel 
meetings.  In general, it was a useful precedent-setting 
exercise, even with a few sour notes.  End summary. 
 
2. (C)  The International Committee to Accompany the 
Transition (CIAT) met with President Kabila, three of the 
four DRC Vice Presidents (VP Bemba is in the U.S.), and the 
head of the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) October 6. 
 Numerous other presidential staff were also present.  The 
meeting was in response to a very long-standing request from 
the CIAT to meet with the \"Espace Presidentiel\" (President 
plus four Vice Presidents), never previously successfully 
realized largely due to the continued deep mistrust felt by 
the rival leaders in the Transition Government. 
 
3. (SBU)  Primary topics discussed during the roughly 
two-hour meeting included the transition \"road map,\" military 
integration and related questions associated with disarmament 
and demobilization, election preparations, and modalities for 
future work.  The CIAT had furnished the Congolese officials 
with its latest iteration of the road map, laying out CIAT 
expectations for the main four focus areas of the transition 
(military integration and DDR, disarmament of foreign armed 
groups, elections, and extension of state authority 
throughout the DRC - see reftel). 
 
4. (C) After opening pleasantries, President Kabila 
acknowledged receipt of the CIAT road map, and observed that 
it closely followed the overall structure of the government\'s 
own draft road map, although he reported the latter to be far 
more detailed outlining steps requiring action.  He also said 
that the GDRC road map is to be discussed with a view toward 
adoption at a Friday, October 8 meeting of the Council of 
Ministers.  By the time the meeting ended, Kabila arranged to 
distribute to all CIAT members the bulky current draft of the 
GDRC plan. 
 
5. (C) In opening comments, SRSG Bill Swing expressed CIAT 
pleasure in holding the meeting, noted the need for similar 
future meetings at regular intervals, and the desire to have 
established follow-up mechanisms.   Swing specifically 
proposed that another full Espace Presidentiel meeting should 
be held linked to the planned late November visit to Kinshasa 
by members of the U.N. Security Council. 
 
6. (C) By prior arrangement, the French Ambassador opened the 
substantive CIAT presentation by speaking about military 
integration plans, including successful steps taken to date 
such as the Belgian-sponsored formation of the integrated 
Ituri Brigade as a counterpart to the \"post-Artemis\" MONUC 
Ituri Brigade.  He observed, however, that there has been a 
lack of a coordinated master plan for overall integration, 
with little general progress realized to-date and 
corresponding problems created for demobilization and 
reintegration plans, as well as for general security.  He 
reported very promising discussions underway to arrive at a 
more coordinated international community position, and 
specifically put forward an idea to move quickly to form an 
integrated \"Kivu Brigade.\"  The latter would be consistent 
with a developing consensus to harmonize currently 
uncoordinated South African and Belgium proposals, and it 
could be meshed easily with standing World Bank 
demobilization plans.  In addition, the proposed brigade 
would be useful to address continuing security concerns in 
the east, associated in part with a very confused and often 
contentious current FARDC military structure in the region. 
As well, it would be fashioned to take on the task of 
forcible disarmament of foreign combatants in the area as 
needed.  The French Ambassador further noted that the IMF had 
indicated that $75 million has been earmarked in the 2005 
budget for military integration (note: an amount which 
includes the police), although the specific sourcing for 
these funds has not yet been identified (e.g., international 
support, GDRC receipts).  He expressed optimism that European 
countries would be in a position to provide significant 
support in this regard. 
7. (C) The European Commission Delegate followed with a 
presentation noting CIAT concerns about pending or recently 
passed election-related laws, and the potential impact on 
elections.  He reflected widespread concerns about the 
relatively short time remaining before elections should be 
held according to the Global and All-Inclusive Accord 
timetable. 
 
8. (C) In the final CIAT statement, the U.K. Ambassador 
picked up on ideas put forward during the recent senior-level 
CIAT member meeting in New York, proposing to establish three 
CIAT sub-committees dealing with security sector reform, 
election-related legislation, and election planning.  He 
observed that the sub-committees would in no way be conceived 
to supplant future general \"Espace Presidentiel\" meetings. 
 
9. (C) Vice President Ruberwa (RCD-Goma) was the first on the 
Congolese side to react, welcoming the CIAT road map and 
observing that he and others would need more time to review 
the document for any inconsistencies with the proposed GDRC 
document.  He noted that DDR is not particularly advanced, 
but it is ahead of integration efforts in that significant 
funding has already been found.  He further welcomed the 
proposal to form a Kivu Brigade.  On a less positive note, 
regarding elections, Ruberwa focused on legal concerns about 
the need for a census prior to elections.  He noted that the 
government had accepted the idea of a voter registration 
exercise, vice full census, given constraints of time and 
money but added that an \"administrative census\" is still 
needed in order properly to allocate legislative seats and 
representation.  Ruberwa also noted that separate versions of 
a nationality law passed by the Senate and National Assembly 
were both \"more or less\" in accordance with the government\'s 
proposals. 
 
10. (C) Vice President Zahidi Ngoma (opposition parties) also 
endorsed the Kivu Brigade initiative, emphasized that Sun 
City accords should not be rewritten (in terms of election 
preparations), and expressed general support for the road 
map, albeit with the caveat that such plans need to be 
sufficiently flexible to respond to changing conditions. 
Later, Zahidi expressed concerns that international funding 
support for elections is insufficient or available only late, 
threatening timely implementation.  Vice President Yerodia, 
in vintage style, made some opening observations about the 
good fortune that the CIAT had not been given the label of 
\"FIAT,\" and that the \"Loch Ness monster\" of the transition 
needs adequate international support to ensure that it is 
controlled. 
 
11. (C) In subsequent discussion, President Kabila endorsed 
the general ideas put forward by the CIAT, and specifically 
called for a follow-up committee meeting as early as this 
Saturday, October 9, to address issues raised.   SRSG Swing 
and some CIAT members expressed confidence that adequate 
funds would be identified for election planning and 
implementation, but also observed that other elements (e.g., 
needed laws) additionally need to be in place.  There was 
substantial back-and-forth on the census question, based 
largely on the implicit recognition by at least the CIAT 
members that a larger census exercise, even if theoretically 
desirable, is simply not feasible within the constraints of 
time and money available.  SRSG Swing underscored the 
principle that the \"perfect should not become the enemy of 
the good.\" 
 
12. (C) Comment: The CIAT had been working to have a meeting 
of this nature for about a year.  Even without Bemba present, 
and with some of the sour notes struck by some of the 
Congolese, it was a useful precedent-setting exercise with 
the various rival Vice Presidents present.  The effort by 
Zahidi and others in essence to set up the international 
community to take the fall for delayed elections or worse is 
unhelpful, but very much consistent with long-established 
Congolese history.  It is unlikely to play well this time 
around, however, because unlike past periods, a broad range 
of the Congolese population have strong expectations that 
results will be produced.  It is clear that many Congolese 
leaders recognize that like it or not, they cannot afford to 
be identified with failure on this front.  The CIAT will, of 
course, continue to push strongly for rapid election 
progress.  Most if not all members recognize that it will be 
difficult logistically, if for no other reason, to get 
elections organized by next June, the current target date. 
It is also accepted by all, however, that it is imperative to 
provide Congolese politicians no maneuvering room to exploit 
opportunities to delay.  Likewise,  the spotlight must remain 
on Congolese leaders, and not on the international community, 
to take responsibility for progress or lack thereof regarding 
elections.  The news regarding GDRC endorsement as early as 
this week of the government\'s road map is also a welcome 
development.  End comment.

Banyamulenge Refugees Determined to Return Home 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (SBU) Aida Mariam, deputy representative of the UN High 
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) told poloff October 7 that 
1,200 Banyamulenge refugees had made their way over the past 
two days to the Burundi-DRC border near Uvira. These refugees 
are currently in a \"no mans land\" border area in Burundi, 
waiting to cross into the Congo. The Congolese border is 
currently closed and it is not expected that it will open 
until a GDRC inter ministerial mission arrives in the area on 
October 8. 
 
3. (SBU) Mariam said this new wave of Banyamulenge refugees 
had organized themselves and even found trucks for transport 
from various villages inside Burundi. She added that the 
RCD-G Vice-Governor of South Kivu claimed not to have been 
involved in encouraging this particular group of refugees to 
return. Mariam noted that while UNHCR respects the wishes of 
refugees to return home, it also wants GDRC officials to be 
on the ground to guarantee the safety of returning refugees 
and to send a clear message to the local population. 
 
GDRC to Send Inter-Ministerial Delegation to Welcome Refugees 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Vice-Minister of Interior Paul Musafiri told poloff 
October 7 that he would travel to Uvira on October 8 with an 
inter ministerial delegation that includes an advisor to 
President Kabila, advisors to Vice-President Ruberwa, and the 
Vice-Minister of Defense for Demobilization. Musafiri said 
that upon his arrival the GDRC will open the border and 
welcome the refugees. He noted the refugees would likely go 
to an Uvira transit center for a few days and then return to 
their own villages. Musafiri indicated that he planned to 
talk to local actors in Uvira about the importance of 
welcoming the refugees and that the GDRC would also 
coordinate assistance with humanitarian agencies. Moreover, 
he explained that the GDRC would keep the border open to 
allow more orderly repatriation of refugees and to prevent 
the gathering of large groups on the border. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) This new wave of Banyamulenge refugees have 
apparently organized themselves to return to the DRC without 
any assistance from UNCHR or other humanitarian agencies. It 
is possible that many of them do not want to be moved to the 
Moaro refugee camp near the Tanzanian border and may have 
feared UNHCR relocation plans. If the refugees perceive that 
they may be more exposed to attacks in Burundi, it is 
reasonable to expect that they will attempt to return home. A 
well-coordinated effort to receive the refugees by the GDRC, 
UN agencies, and other humanitarian actors, will be necessary 
to lessen the likelihood of violence against the refugees, 
and further manipulation of their return by local actors.

1. (SBU) Summary. UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) 
officials in Kinshasa expressed concern October 3 over the 
manipulation of refugee returns to the East from Burundi, 
Rwanda, and Tanzania. They are trying to work with the 
various governments involved to facilitate repatriation of 
refugees, but do not, however, see the need at this time for 
the repatriation of thousands of refugees from Tanzanian 
UNHCR-run camps. The Congolese government is making some 
efforts to sensitize the population of South Kivu about the 
need to welcome all refugees, yet there is no uniform policy 
towards Banyamulenge refugees, and hard liners in the 
government appear to be encouraging opposition to the return 
of this particular group. End Summary. 
 
More Refugees to Return from Burundi to South Kivu 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (SBU) Poloff met September 30 with Aida Mariam, UNHCR\'s 
Deputy Country Representative in the DRC to discuss upcoming 
refugee returns to the DRC. Mariam said that UNHCR expects 
continued refugee returns from Burundi to South Kivu in the 
coming weeks. Vice-Minister of Interior Paul Musafiri told 
poloff October 1 that he would travel to Burundi and South 
Kivu in the following days to coordinate refugee assistance 
efforts. He said the Congo wanted a more organized return of 
refugees from Burundi in order to avoid a humanitarian 
crisis. MONUC sources in Kinshasa said that the UN was 
encouraging future returns from Burundi in manageable groups 
of 50 refugees at a time. 
 
3. (SBU) Acting UNHCR country representative, Mohamed Dayri, 
told poloff October 3 that out of the 366 mostly Banyamulenge 
refugees who arrived in Uvira the previous week (reftel), 150 
were planning to go to Minemwe and about 100 were planing to 
stay in Uvira; the remainder would go to other nearby 
communities. The situation in Uvira was reportedly calm. 
 
Banyamulenge Refugees at Cyangungu want to Return 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (SBU) According to Dayri, approximately 700 Banyamulenge 
refugees remained at the Cyangungu transit center in Rwanda, 
close to the DRC border. These refugees had refused to be 
moved to refugee camps in central Rwanda. They clearly 
expressed to UNHCR authorities their wish to return to the 
Bukavu area from which they fled during earlier hostilities. 
Mariam told poloff that UNHCR\'s task in dealing with these 
refugees has been complicated by the attention given to 
Banyamulenge refugees in general and by the efforts of 
diverse groups to manipulate their return. She also explained 
that UNHCR could not keep refugees at a temporary transit 
center near the border for an indefinite period of time, 
especially after the Gatumba massacre. Dayri said that 
UNHCR-Kigali and Rwandan authorities have agreed to keep the 
transit center open for an additional month to provide 
sufficient time for a more organized return of refugees. 
 
5. (SBU) Musafiri told poloff that his mission to South Kivu 
included trips to Uvira and Bukavu to meet with civil 
society, church, and local authorities to sensitize people 
about the importance of accepting and welcoming returning 
refugees. He also would work to organize a committee in 
Bukavu to assist the expected refugees from Rwanda. Musafiri 
acknowledged that the GDRC did not speak with one voice in 
this matter and that differences of opinion regarding the 
return of refugees complicated his task. 
 
Political Pawns: Bringing Refugees Back from Tanzania 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6. (SBU) Dayri explained that the Vice-Governor for South 
Kivu was working to bring back to the Congo up to 3,500 
refugees from Tanzania in the coming days. Most would be 
coming back to Uvira, Fizi, and Baraka in South Kivu. About 
500, however, would be going to Kalemie, an area that is 
already having difficulties coping with internally displaced 
people. Dayri was critical of this effort, saying there is no 
reason to rush the return of this particular group of 
refugees from UNHCR camps in Tanzania to Congolese areas that 
lack the humanitarian infrastructure to receive them. 
(Comment: The Vice-Governor, who is from the civil society 
component of the transitional government, is openly 
manipulating refugee returns for political gain, trying to 
bring large numbers of non-Banyamulenge refugees to offset 
the 366 Gatumba survivors who returned to Uvira. This is an 
apparent \"tit for tat\" contest with the RCD-G South Kivu 
Vice-Governor, who is seen as the Banyamulenges\' sponsor, and 
is also guilty of political gamesmanship as he seeks to 
bolster his provincial base. End Comment.) 
 
 
UNHCR Plans to Start Repatriation from CAR to Equateur 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7. (U) Mariam said that now that the DRC has signed a 
tripartite agreement with the Central African Republic (CAR) 
UNHCR would work to repatriate up to 3,000 refugees from 
UNHCR camps in the CAR back to Equateur Province before the 
end of the year. She estimates that there are an additional 
7,000 Congolese refugees in CAR who live outside camps and 
who will also receive assistance to return to the DRC. 
 
No Repatriation from Congo-Brazzaville for this Year 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8. (U) Mariam explained that, although the GDRC also signed a 
tripartite agreement with Congo-Brazzaville, repatriation of 
refugees would not begin until next year due to the 
difficulty of traveling during the rainy season. She 
estimates that there are over 70,000 Congolese refugees in 
Congo-Brazzaville, most of whom will return to northern 
Equateur province. (Comment: Despite the difficult 
humanitarian situation in the province, the security 
situation in Equateur remains relatively stable, especially 
when compared to the east of the country. End Note.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (SBU) Repatriation of refugees is normally coordinated by 
UNHCR with the respective governments of the countries 
involved through tripartite agreements. The return of 
Banyamulenge refugees to South Kivu, however, has changed 
this dynamic as local and national actors try to manipulate 
the issue for political gain. As one Vice-Governor from South 
Kivu tries to encourage Banyamulenge returns, the other seeks 
even larger returns of non-Banyamulenge from Tanzania, most 
likely with the support of hardline elements in Kinshasa. 
UNHCR finds itself in the uncomfortable position of being 
criticized for being too-cautious in its approach to refugee 
returns. Their mandate, however, is to safeguard the physical 
integrity of refugees under international law and to evaluate 
carefully the feasibility of returns to areas that remain 
volatile. UNHCR is correct in this case about its concerns of 
rapid large scale refugee returns to South Kivu, regarding 
both logistical and security issues. Nonetheless, the agency 
appears to have recognized to some degree that it needs to be 
flexible when facing returns of determined refugees.

SUBJECT: CUSTOMS BUREAU LEADS NEW LABOR UNREST 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1474 
 
1. (U) Summary. Office des Douanes et Accises (Ofida - 
Customs Agency) re-initiated a nationwide strike on Monday, 
Oct 4. This strike is the third in 2004 by Ofida, whose 
employees are demanding increased salaries before returning 
to work. Ofida is attempting to bring other agencies under 
the control of the Ministry of Finance into the strike. 
Continued and growing labor unrest is possible. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Ofida began its third strike of 2004 on Monday, Oct 4. 
The strike is being conducted nationwide and has paralysed 
the ports of Matadi and Boma and the border crossing at 
Kasumbalesa (Katanga Province), and the customs office at 
Kinshasa airport. Matadi and Kasumbalesa are the primary 
ports of entry for imported goods entering the DRC. 
Meanwhile, the main border crossings in the Eastern DRC 
remain open, although workers there support the strike in 
principle. Ofida workers are demanding salaries to be 
increased to USD 200 for the lowest paid worker (e.g. 
sanitation, doorman, etc.) graded upwards at a 10 percent 
increase per level. The GDRC refused to budge past FC 10,000 
(USD 25) per month for the lowest salary in February and 
March salary negotiations (reftel). (Note: Conversions are 
done at USD 1 to FC 400, the prevailing rate for September. 
End Note.) 
 
3. (U) Radio Okapi (Monuc Radio) has reported that the Ofida 
Provincial Director for Bas-Congo estimates that the loss of 
earnings per day is FC 120 million (USD 300,000). Meanwhile, 
approximately 10 ships are waiting to unload their cargo at 
Matadi. Each day the shipping companies incur additional fees 
of USD 40,000 to USD 50,000 while waiting for Ofida to end 
the strike and return to work. 
 
4. (U) Two export-import firms have confirmed that nothing is 
passing through either Kasumbalesa or Matadi. Not even 
\"minimum service\" is being provided. The \"Guichet Unique\" 
(one-stop processing) systems in Matadi and Kinshasa are 
closed. Trucks are backing up at Kasumbalesa and Sakania in 
Katanga Province. There is no gasoline available in either 
Lubumbashi or Mbuji Mayi (which is supplied by Lubumbashi). 
Futhermore, the strike will put most export-import firms 
behind at least two weeks in shipping and sales. One firm 
stated that it has cancelled all orders for the next few 
weeks until the situation is resolved. Lubumbashi sources 
have noted that the exchange rate is slowly rising due to a 
lack of dollars on the market as firms pay extended fees. At 
Matadi, one export-import source reports that ONATRA (the 
National Office of Transportation, i.e. port authority) is 
being very flexible in the payment of additional port fees 
(e.g. allowing partial payment or payment cancellations) due 
to the strike conditions being out of the control of shipping 
and export-import firms. 
 
5. (SBU) Ofida workers and the Intersyndical de Kinshasa (a 
broad collection of civil servant unions) are threatening to 
push other revenue generating services into a general strike 
in 72 hours if their demands are not met. These services 
would include DGRAD and DGI (both of which are tax services), 
and possibly others which are under the control of the 
Ministry of Finance. The workers and unions have also voiced 
concerns regarding ongoing investigations into high level 
officials in DGRAD and the Ministry of Finance for 
mismanagement and corruption. Business sources claim that the 
government initially told them on Monday that the strike 
would not be serious and would only last one or two days. 
However, they now believe that it will take at least until 
Monday, Oct 11, for the GDRC and the unions to reach a 
solution. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment. The ongoing labor difficulties pose several 
problems for the GDRC. First, most basic consumer products, 
such as soaps and detergents and processed foods, and all 
manufactured goods are imported. The paralysis at Matadi and 
Kasumbalesa halts all imports. Second, the loss of tax and 
customs revenue over a long period of time would adversely 
effect the government\'s ability to plan a budget within the 
confines of the IMF/World Bank programs. Third, serious 
problems at the Port of Matadi will threaten the completion 
of International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandated 
improvements. The IMO granted the GDRC a six-month extension 
(until December 2004) to complete improvements and comply 
with International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) 
Code. If it does not comply with IMO regulations, it will be 
decertified and insurance rates for ships entering Matadi 
will skyrocket. 
 
7. (U) It appears unlikely that the GDRC will meet Ofida\'s 
demands. It has previously refused to go above FC 10,000 
because doing so would get the DRC off track with the 
IMF/World Bank. Previous solutions involved paying a portion 
of back wages (reftel). If the strike continues for any 
lenght of time, and if other services under the Ministry of 
Finance join in, the efffects could put a damper on the 
steady economic growth the country has achieved over the past 
three years. End Comment.

1. (C) Summary. A group of over 1600 Congolese refugees, 
including over 500 Banyamulenge, crossed the Burundian border 
into the DRC and arrived at the Uvira transit center October 
12. Many of these refugees had waited at the border since 
October 6 as a GDRC interministerial delegation traveled to 
the area to negotiate their repatriation. This delegation 
witnessed firsthand violent protests against the return of 
Banyamulenge refugees orchestrated by local military and 
political actors. Surprisingly the GDRC has done a good job 
of handling this tense situation possibly motivated by the 
desire to avoid a reprise of the Gatumba massacre, albeit on 
Congolese soil. End Summary. 
 
Mixed Group of Refugees Waits for Days at DRC-Burundi Border 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
2. (U) A group of over 500 Banyamulenge refugees attempting 
to return home arrived at the DRC-Burundi border October 6. 
They were later joined by over 1000 additional refugees from 
other South Kivu ethnic groups including Bafulero and 
Babembe. The border remained closed, however, as a Congolese 
government delegation prepared to travel from Kinshasa to 
Uvira on October 8 to coordinate the refugees\' return. 
 
3. (C) Upon arrival in Uvira on October 8, the Congolese 
delegation (the Vice-Minister of Interior, the Vice-Minister 
of Defense for Reintegration, and an advisor to President 
Kabila) were met by demonstrators who expressed opposition to 
the return of the refugees. According to MONUC and UNHCR 
sources, South Kivu local officials, Mai Mai soldiers under 
commander Nakabaka and members of Congolese intelligence 
agencies in Uvira mobilized opposition to the return of 
refugees supported by the GDRC delegation. 
 
4. (U) On October 9 demonstrators erected barricades on the 
road leading from Uvira to the Burundi border to prevent the 
repatriation of the refugees. They also threw rocks at MONUC 
vehicles and at those of other UN agencies in Uvira. MONUC 
had to use tear gas and fire in the air to disperse the 
crowd. Some of the demonstrators later claimed that an 
11-year old girl had been killed by MONUC during the 
demonstration. MONUC categorically denied this allegation. 
Newspapers in Kinshasa, however, reported October 12 that 
demonstrators were now saying that the victim was actually a 
15-year old boy. (Comment: Other humanitarian agencies in 
South  Kivu including UNHCR have also dismissed this 
allegation as baseless. End Comment.) 
 
Refugees are Finally Allowed to Enter the DRC 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The GDRC finally allowed the refugees to cross the 
border October 11, but decided to keep them on the outskirts 
of Uvira for registration and screening, which proceeded 
without any incidents. MONUC peacekeepers removed the road 
barriers leading to Uvira the previous night to prepare for 
the transfer. UNHCR officials in South Kivu confirmed October 
12 that a convoy of several trucks transporting 1619 refugees 
arrived without any incident at the MONUC transit center in 
Uvira. Various UN agencies, including UNHCR, UNICEF, and OCHA 
along with NGOs present in Uvira provided humanitarian 
assistance to the refugees. 
 
6. (C) The British Ambassador told Charge October 11 that he 
had underscored to President Kabila the importance of 
addressing the refugee situation in Uvira. Kabila replied 
that he had his advisor and the Vice-Minister of Interior on 
the ground and that they were following the situation 
closely. SRSG Swing reportedly talked to President Kabila as 
well on October 10. (Comment: Kabila appears to have made the 
right decision prior to these interventions as a GDRC 
delegation had already arrived in Uvira October 8 to 
coordinate the safe repatriation of these refugees. End 
Comment.) 
 
Over 25,000 Congolese Refugees Remain in Burundi 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7. (U) According to UNHCR Bukavu, over 25,000 Congolese 
refugees remain in Burundi. Most of these are part of an 
older caseload who have been in the country for a long time. 
Out of the approximately 7,000 refugees who entered Burundi 
in June and July 2004, over 3,000 have already returned to 
the DRC, including most of the Banyamulenge. The remaining 
refugees have settled in camps inside Burundi and in the city 
of Bujumbura. 
 
Comment 
------- 
8. (SBU) The GDRC seems to have defused - at least for now- 
the tense and dangerous situation that developed in Uvira. 
After witnessing firsthand the manipulation of refugee 
returns by hard-line elements in South Kivu, it remains to be 
seen what action, if any, Kinshasa will take against military 
and political actors who have fostered intolerance and 
violence against the Banyamulenge population in South Kivu. 
Kinshasa seems seized with the importance of controlling the 
local situation possibly motivated in part by a desire to 
avoid a reprise of the Gatumba massacre, albeit in DRC. It 
seems clear, however, that local officials were not alone in 
steering up trouble. Kinshasa will therefore have to put its 
own house in order to ensure that initially positive steps 
towards ethnic reconciliation such as the proposed 
nationality law can actually be effective.

1. (C) Summary. A large crowd threw rocks and threatened to 
kill UN peacekeepers whose vehicle had broken down in the 
center of Bukavu on October 6 after they saw them 
transporting a man of Tutsi appearance. Although this person 
was a long time MONUC Congolese interpreter of Mushi 
ethnicity, the crowd asserted that he was a Rwandan 
infiltrator. Despite the fact that this incident took place 
close to the office of the regional military commander, 
neither he nor his troops intervened to disperse the crowd 
for two hours until UN personnel threatened to shoot in 
self-defense. This incident as well as demonstrations against 
the return of Banyamulenge refugees in Uvira (reftels), is 
further evidence of a dangerous campaign of manipulation and 
intolerance against Congolese of Tutsi ethnicity by the media 
in Kinshasa and by civil society, military, and church 
figures in South Kivu.  End Summary. 
 
Crowd Targets Peacekeepers Seen with \"Tutsi\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) MONUC sources in Bukavu described to poloff October 6 
an incident which took place in Bukavu the preceding day. At 
approximately 10:30 AM a MONUC APC broke down in the center 
of Bukavu. The APC was transporting Uruguayan peacekeepers 
and a Congolese interpreter who works for MONUC. A woman who 
saw the interpreter\'s face assumed that he was a Tutsi and 
started screaming that MONUC was transporting a Rwandan 
infiltrator. A crowd gathered quickly around the peacekeepers 
and began insulting MONUC, throwing rocks, and demanding 
access to the Tutsi. The individual in question was in fact a 
Mushi and not a Tutsi, but he happened to have facial 
features associated with Tutsis. 
 
FARDC\'s General Mabe Ignores Situation for Two Hours 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3. (C) The crowd around the peacekeepers grew to over a 
thousand people, including many students, and the threats 
continued for close to two hours. As this incident was taking 
place, MONUC staff tried to reach FARDC\'s 10th military 
region commander General Mbuja Mabe, whose office was located 
less than 150 meters from where the crowd had assembled. Mabe 
did not answer MONUC\'s phone calls and FARDC soldiers present 
in the area did not intervene to disperse the crowd. Once the 
crowd started to threaten to burn peacekeepers alive, MONUC 
said that it would fire in self-defense. At this point, Mabe 
emerged from his office and his soldiers started to disperse 
the crowd. According to MONUC, it would have been unlikely 
that Mabe, whose office window faces the street where the 
crowd had gathered, would not have seen or heard the large 
crowd for the two hours that they threatened the peacekeepers. 
 
4. (C) MONUC staff reported that the same crowd which 
threatened the peacekeepers also looted the offices of the 
Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-G) located in the 
same area. FARDC soldiers did not intervene to stop the crowd 
from entering the premises of this political party. On the 
contrary, according to MONUC sources, FARDC soldiers actually 
incited the crowd and even laughed as both peacekeepers and 
the RCD-G offices were attacked. Several Uruguayan peacekeers 
suffered injuries, albeit not serious ones, as a result of 
the attack on the APC. 
 
Media Propaganda Against Tutsis Continues 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The pro-government Kinshasa daily newspaper \"L\'Avenir\" 
published an article about the Bukavu incident, but it 
claimed falsely that a riot had been averted thanks to Mabe\'s 
intervention after MONUC had hidden two Rwandans in a tank. 
Another major daily newspaper, \"La Reference Plus\", published 
the same day a front page article from a Bukavu NGO on the 
Gatumba massacre. This NGO alleged that the victims at 
Gatumba had not been Banyamulenge refugees, but Rwandan Tutsi 
soldiers who had infiltrated the camp to attack the Congo. 
The usually moderate newspaper provided prominent coverage to 
this five-page article without questioning the credibility of 
the baseless allegations. 
 
6. (C) MONUC and UNHCR sources in Bukavu have also referred 
to a campaign by civil society, politicians, the military, 
and church leaders in South Kivu against the return of 
Banyamulenge refugees, portraying members of this ethnic 
group in public and private statements as non-Congolese and 
suggesting that they are Rwandan infiltrators bent on 
attacking the Congo. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (C) The attack on MONUC peacekeepers in Bukavu by a large 
crowd of civilians who thought MONUC was hiding a \"Tutsi\" 
illustrates the high level of paranoia and animosity which 
has been fomented in South Kivu against this ethnic group. 
The demonstrations in Uvira against the return of 
Banyamulenge (ethnic Tutsis) refugees from Burundi has also 
been part of a related manipulation effort by hard-line 
elements in South Kivu. Further ethnically-motivated attacks 
in this province could lead to a major incident threatening 
the peace process and the transition. The GDRC needs to take 
a stand to halt a growing campaign of ethnic hatred in South 
Kivu and elsewhere. 
 
8. (U) Bujumbura minimize considered.

SUBJECT: Congo-Kinshasa Annual Certification of Consular 
Management Controls 
 
Ref: State 201680 
 
1.   Vice Consul James Fennell, FS-04, Acting Chief of the 
Consular Section, completed review of consular management 
controls on October 8, 2004.  Deputy Chief of Mission 
certified the review on October 13, 2004.  Answers are keyed 
to para four of reftel. 
 
(a) Standard Operating Procedures: Conoff and backup officer 
have online access to FAM, CMH, SOP cables and the CA 
intranet websites, both classified and unclassified.  Hard 
copies of FAM, CMH and key SOP cables are also available for 
quick reference. 
 
(b) Consular Shared Tables Management: CST active user list 
reflects only those users present at post with a need for 
access.  Only consular section employees have consular 
roles, and adjudicatory and management roles are limited to 
Americans with consular authority.  All users are assigned 
the appropriate access levels.  Passwords are reset at least 
every six months, are randomly chosen by the individual and 
known to no one else. 
 
(c) Access: Physical access to the working areas of the 
consular section are controlled and limited to consular 
section staff or escorted visitors. 
 
(d) Physical Inventory of Accountable Consular Items: Conoff 
conducts a physical inventory of all accountable items 
approximately every quarter.  The last such count was 
conducted in October 2004.  Results of inventories are 
submitted in writing to the file. 
 
(e) Control and Reconciliation of Accountable Items: 
Internal section procedures ensure that accountable consular 
supplies are properly controlled, handled, destroyed and 
accounted for.  Daily/Monthly Reconciliation and 
Accountability Log is used for reconciling daily usage of 
all visa foils, passports and CRBAs. 
 
(f) Cash Accountability: Accountable officer is familiar 
with CMH 700.  Daily and monthly reconciliation of consular 
fee receipts are properly implemented. 
 
(g) Referral System: Post visa referral system complies with 
current regulations.  Referral procedures are available in 
writing and reviewed at least yearly with American officers. 
Referrals are few -- only one was submitted in FY04. 
 
(h) Training: Consular staff are adequately trained for 
their responsibilities.  Fraud information from CA, other 
agencies and outside sources such as local police and other 
embassies is shared with all staff.  Post will nominate 
additional local staff for fraud training in FY05. 
 
(i)  Standards of Employee Conduct: Conoff has reviewed 
\"Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive 
Branch\" and Chapter 600 of the CMH.  Ethics issues are 
discussed in consular staff meetings and individually with 
local staff during employee review sessions. 
 
(j) Name Check and Clearance Reviews: Namecheck returns are 
rigorously reviewed and consistent standards are applied 
when determining whether a hit warrants further action. 
 
(k) Visa Lookout Accountability (VLA): All issuing officers 
fully understand VLA provisions.  Post submitted VLA 
compliance cable in September 2004. 
 
(l) Intake, Screening and Processing: Intake, screening and 
processing procedures are in compliance with department 
regulations with the exception that the physical structure 
of the Consular Section impedes FSO line-of-sight 
supervision of LES.  Remodeling to provide such oversight 
has been approved for FY05. Fingerprinting is conducted by 
consular officers. 
 
(m) Interview and Adjudication: All applicants for whom a 
personal appearance is required appear for interviews. LES 
review applications for completeness, but do not 
preadjudicate visa applications. 
 
(n) Photo Standards: Photo standards are rigorously applied 
for visa applicants. 
 
(o) Review of Visa Refusals and Issuances: Visa refusals are 
regularly reviewed by supervisor and issuances are spot 
checked by same. 
 
(p) Visa Shopping: Consular staff are alert to possible visa- 
shopping.  Due to low levels of third-country national 
applicants, however, no trends have been identified at post. 
 
(q) Files: Consular files are being retained in accordance 
with \"Record Retention Guidelines\" and 9 FAM Exhibit F. 
(r) Post passport and CRBA issuances are periodically 
audited by consular manager. 
 
(s) Anti-Fraud Program: Conoff serves as fraud prevention 
manager and oversees LES investigators.  When fully staffed, 
two LES conduct fraud investigations.  Conoff periodically 
validates random investigation results and requests other 
LES to investigate same case in order to compare results. 
LES staff investigations provide factual information only 
and do not influence cases in other ways.  Note:  Staffing 
shortages and travel restrictions due to civil war and poor 
infrastructure limit anti-fraud efforts.  However, any anti- 
raud work is actively supervised by an FSO.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) OFDA Rep Jay Nash and Acting USAID Mission 
Director Nicholas Jenks were in Bukavu on September 7 
and 8, and in Kindu on September 9.  Interlocutors in 
Bukavu told USAID reps that the population was happy 
to be finally out from under RCD/G and Tutsi control 
after six years, but worried that Rwanda and its 
RCD/G proxies would not long tolerate this situation 
and would try to retake the city militarily. There 
are few ethnic Tutsis in Bukavu at present, and 
though many felt that a return of Banyamulenge 
residents who fled during the Bukavu crisis of May- 
June would be possible, disputes over property rights 
could well ensue, the legitimacy of the previous 
Banyamulenge occupation of many houses in town being 
in question.  Sources of insecurity in South Kivu 
continue to be the forces of Laurent Nkunda in the 
Kalehe-Minova area and the various pockets of 
Interahamwe in rural areas of the province.  Among 
the latter group, the numbers of those volunteering 
for MONUC\'s DDRRR program have dwindled. 
 
2. The activities of Nkunda\'s forces have caused the 
displacement of as many as 40,000 people from the 
areas they currently occupy, although reports from 
the field after USAID\'s visit suggest that 
governmental forces from Bukavu are succeeding in 
pushing Nkunda further north towards Goma. Conditions 
for the IDPs in the sites visited by USAID Reps were 
not good, as not all have received plastic sheeting 
and food, and as the nearest health facilities are 
several hours walk away.  Water and sanitation at the 
sites continue to be problematic, and rape by 
military has been a major problem.  Though 
humanitarian activities outside Bukavu town were shut 
down entirely for several weeks after the crisis of 
late May-early June, most humanitarian agencies have 
restarted or are in the process of doing so now.  The 
Nyabibwe area, still occupied by Nkunda\'s troops at 
the time of USAID Reps\' visit to Kalehe, remains 
inaccessible, however, as do some Interahamwe- 
occupied pockets.  In Maniema Province, security is 
no longer an issue and the main constraint on 
humanitarian access is now entirely logistical. An 
estimated 80% of former IDPs of the province, along 
with many former Mai-Mai, have returned already to 
their original villages.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (U) OFDA Rep Jay Nash and Acting USAID Mission 
Director Nicholas Jenks were in Bukavu on September 7 
and 8, and in Kindu on September 9.  The Bukavu 
segment of the trip included a single day road/boat 
excursion to the northern sections of Kalehe 
Peninsula where approximately 10,000 IDPS from the 
Nyabibwe area have taken refuge from killings and 
harassment by forces loyal to ex-RCD/G commander 
Laurent Nkunda. 
 
-------------------- 
Atmosphere in Bukavu 
-------------------- 
 
4. (U) USAID Reps\' local interlocutors in Bukavu 
described the population of the city as being 
simultaneously \"very happy\" and \"worried about the 
future.\"  The happiness comes from the fact that the 
population feels that as a result of the departure of 
the forces of ex-RCD/G commanders Jules Mutebutsi and 
Laurent Nkunda in June, they have now finally been 
largely liberated from the Tutsi politico-military 
domination that they have been experiencing since 
Banyamulenge forces entered the town in 1996 during 
the \"first\" war (which ousted Mobutu and installed 
Laurent Kabila).  Though there remains an RCD/G 
appointed Tutsi Vice-Governor, real control of the 
city for the moment seems to be in the hands of the 
Kinshasa-appointed governor and regional military 
commander-an impression reinforced by the presence in 
town of many new troops sent from other parts of the 
country, particularly Equateur (ex-MLC). 
 
5. (U) Bukavuans\' anxiety about the future is due to 
uncertainty that the present situation can last.  It 
is clear in the speech of virtually everyone in the 
town that they do not consider the war to be by any 
means yet over.  Specifically, they doubt that Rwanda 
will let Bukavu remain largely \"independent\" of its 
control, and thus expect another Nkunda-like crisis 
at some point in the near future.  In particular they 
are worried that the international community will 
pressure the transitional government in Kinshasa to 
bow to Vice President Ruberwa\'s demand that 10th 
Regional Commander Mbuza Mabe be replaced.  General 
Mabe is viewed by the population of Bukavu as the 
savior and protector of the city and is thus very 
much a popular local hero.  The population is afraid 
that if he is replaced, the city will again fall into 
RCD/G and Rwanda domination, probably by military 
take over. 
 
6. (U) USAID Reps inquired as to whether there were 
any ethnic Tutsi remaining in Bukavu, now that many 
Banyamulenge had fled to Rwanda during the May crisis 
in Bukavu.  Interlocutors reported that there are a 
handful of government-loyal Banyamulenge soldiers 
from General Masunzu\'s command in town, and that they 
move around town freely experiencing no problems from 
the local population.  There are also some ex-RCD/G 
Tutsi soldiers (of unknown origin) that arrived in 
town recently from Goma as bodyguards for the Tutsi 
Vice-Governor. 
 
7. (U) Though USAID Reps\' interlocutors felt that it 
would now be \"safe\" for Banyamulenge civilians who 
had fled in May to return to the city, they noted 
that some of their residences had been now occupied 
by others.  As many Banyamulenge illegally occupied 
houses belonging to others when they first came to 
town in 1996 and 1997, it is now unclear, in many 
cases, as to whom property really belongs.  This 
might thus easily prove an obstacle to a full-scale 
return of Banyamulenge refugees and prove a 
troublesome issue in the future. 
 
-------------------- 
Insecurity and DDRRR 
-------------------- 
 
8. (U) There are mainly two sources of insecurity in 
South Kivu at the present time:  the yet-intact 
forces of Laurent Nkunda in the area between Kalehe 
and Goma along the western shore of Lake Kivu, and 
the pockets of Interahamwe in various rural areas 
around the province.  The former group has caused the 
displacement of up to 40,000 civilians since May of 
this year.  As yet unconfirmed reports from the field 
subsequent to USAID Reps\' visit to the Kalehe area 
suggest that General Mbuza Mabe\'s government troops 
from Bukavu may now be attempting to push Nkunda\'s 
forces north past Minova and have had some early 
successes.  As for the latter group, Interahamwe 
pillaging, rape and other violence recently caused 
the displacement of 3000 civilians in the Walungu 
area, and continues to be a problem in Mwenga 
territory. 
 
9. (U) MONUC DDRRR specialists in Bukavu told USAID 
Reps that voluntary repatriation of Interahamwe and 
ex-FAR always tapers off whenever there is fighting 
between various factions for control of the city or 
of other key towns in the region.  The months 
following the Bukavu crisis of late May and early 
June have been no exception, with repatriation 
volunteers having dwindled to a trickle.  It is 
believed that during periods when the region is 
stable and appearing to make progress toward 
returning to some normalcy, the Interahamwe are less 
tolerated by local Mai-Mai groups, and experience 
greater isolation.  During periods of acute turmoil 
and anxiety, however, when local populations are 
worried that the province may again be overrun by 
forces loyal to Rwanda, Interahamwe elements enjoy 
greater freedom of moment and less pressure. 
 
10. (U) The MONUC DDRRR team also told USAID Reps 
that former 10th Military Region Commander Nabiolwa 
was much more a pro-active collaborator in DDRRR 
efforts than current commander Mbuza Mabe.  They 
attribute Mabe\'s cooler attitude to an acute 
awareness among FARDC officers since the May-June 
Bukavu crisis that they will not be able to count on 
the MONUC\'s support should they again have to fight 
renegade insurgents opposing the authority of the 
transitional government in the Bukavu-Goma area. 
 
-------------- 
IDPs in Kalehe 
-------------- 
 
11. (U) USAID Reps accompanied International Rescue 
Committee (IRC) staff to the Chabula and Chigera IDP 
sites on the peninsula extending into Lake Kivu north 
of Kalehe town on September 8.  The sites were 
hosting 1008 and 326 IDP families respectively.  The 
great majority of the IDPs at these locations had 
fled the Nyabibwe area in the hills across the 
channel separating the peninsula from the mainland on 
May 27 when Laurent Nkunda\'s forces marched through 
their area on the way to Bukavu.  It is at least the 
third time that these same populations have fled 
their home villages in the same manner for the same 
destinations, people having fled first in 1998 when 
the RCD rebellion began, then later fled again in 
2002 in response to Interahamwe raids. 
 
12. (U) When asked why they did not return home now, 
the IDPs replied that it was clear that the war was 
not yet over.   They had heard from newly arriving 
IDPs - described as those who had originally 
attempted to \"stick it out\" in the home villages - 
many stories of continuing pillaging, rape and murder 
by Nkunda\'s soldiers.  As recently as five days 
earlier, the IDPs reported hearing sustained heavy 
gunfire - presumably a skirmish between Nkunda\'s 
forces and Mbuza Mabe\'s Bukavu-based FARDC soldiers - 
coming from the hills across the bay where they used 
to live.  When asked who made up Nkunda\'s army, the 
IDPs replied that these were almost entirely 
Rwandaphones, with the rank-and-file being largely 
Hutu and the leadership mostly Tutsi. 
 
13. (U) Living conditions for the IDPs are not good. 
Though some have received plastic sheeting and non- 
food item kits from UNICEF, as well as a single 
ration of food from WFP, others have not yet been 
served, and there are still no mechanisms in place to 
assist newcomers.  Water and sanitation are 
problematic, since the IDPs had no alternative but to 
settle on steep slopes immediately adjacent to the 
lake where there is no water supply.  The 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has 
constructed a handful of latrines and is building 
additional ones, but the proximity of the latrines to 
the lake, necessitated by the steep inclines, 
represents a health hazard.  To provide safe water to 
the IDPs, IRC pumps water from the lake into bladders 
then treats it with chlorine prior to distribution 
through spigots.  IRC plans to increase its 
intervention in the water sector and to begin 
providing health services as well.  At the present 
time, the nearest health facility is several hours 
walk away over mountainous terrain. 
 
14. (U) Although the IDPs have been living in these 
conditions for over three months with only one food 
distribution, they did not appear to be starving.  It 
is clear that they are still depending on food 
supplies coming across the bay from their former 
villages.  Sending representatives back to the 
villages, however, remains highly dangerous, as these 
risk encountering Nkunda\'s soldiers and having 
everything taken from them as well as physically 
harmed.  Many women who have attempted this have been 
raped. 
15. (U) Rape continues to be a huge problem.  At the 
reference hospital serving the area, USAID Reps 
learned that 20 new cases had come for consultations 
and treatment in the previous week alone.  Hospital 
authorities reported that there were over 100 cases 
documented since May (when Nkunda\'s forces first came 
through the territory), which, considering that the 
total for all the preceding years of the war was 400, 
represented a huge increase. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Humanitarian access South Kivu and Maniema 
------------------------------------------ 
 
16. (U) Humanitarian activities outside Bukavu town 
itself were shut down entirely for several weeks 
after the Bukavu crisis of late May-early June when 
expatriate humanitarian staff evacuated the city and 
MONUC recommended that local staff no longer travel 
outside city limits.  By mid-July, expatriate staff 
had largely returned, and as of the end of August, 
most agencies had started sending teams to the field. 
OFDA partner International Medical Corps (IMC), which 
runs a health and nutrition program in Bunyakiri 
territory, plans to reopen their support to health 
centers in that area next week. Goal, another OFDA 
partner who, before the events of May-June, was 
running a similar program in Lulingu to the northwest 
of Bukavu but had evacuated the area as a precaution, 
also plans to be fully operational once again in a 
few weeks time.  Humanitarians from Bukavu continue, 
however, to have no access at all to areas north of 
Kalehe in the Nkunda-dominated part of the province. 
 
17. (U) In Maniema Province, the constraint on 
humanitarian access is new entirely logistical, 
according to staff of Catholic Relief Services (CRS) 
and OCHA with whom USAID reps spoke in Kindu.  None 
of those questioned could think of any areas in the 
province where humanitarian agencies would fear to go 
for security reasons.  Unfortunately, however, given 
the extremely poor condition of all roads in the 
region, the improved security situation does not 
immediately translate into increased access.  Many 
areas remain accessible only by motorcycle, and some 
only on foot. 
 
18. (U) It is believed that at least 80% of former 
IDPs in the region have returned to their villages. 
The few who have remained in the forest are believed 
to do so either because they have absolutely nothing 
to go back to in their home villages or because they 
still have crops to harvest in the area where they 
have been living for the past few years.  Most Mai- 
Mai who came to Kindu in the latter part of 2003 and 
first half of 2004 are believed now to have returned 
to their villages, having tired of waiting for 
integration into the FARDC.  The humanitarians report 
them appearing to no longer be a consolidated force 
in Kindu town itself. MEECE.

SUBJECT: JVM: STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1904 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  Monuc DDR chief expressed doubts October 14 
that the proposed JVM office in Bukavu will be opened in the 
near future, given the recent attack on Monuc peacekeepers by 
COngoleses civilians who erroneously believed MONUC was 
transporting a Rwandan (reftel).  Monuc has informed both 
Rwanda and the DRC that it will not transport armed JVM 
participants in Monuc vehicles, since Monuc milobs who would 
be accompanying the teams will be unarmed.  Congo\'s lead 
representative to the JVM discussions, Ambassador-at-Large 
Antoine Ghonda, submitted his recommendations to President 
Kabila October 13. Ghonda recommends that the DRC should 
insist on a provision that all allegations should be 
investigated, regardless of the source, and that a new 
element be added to assist with the progressive repatriation 
of refugees.  As of October 16 he had not received 
confirmation that these have been approved, in large part 
because  Kabila is making his first official trip to the east 
(septel).  Ghonda hoped to have a response to Monuc on or 
about October 20, acknowledging that the JVM bureaus probably 
would not open October 18 as previously planned.  End Summary. 
 
Monuc -- Having Second Thoughts? 
 
2. (C)  PolCouns met October 14 with Monuc DDR chief Peter 
Swarbrick to discuss progress -- or lack thereof -- on the 
Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM).  (Note:  Swarbrick said 
that DDR has the lead on JVM within Monuc, in large part 
because SRSG Swing hopes that eventually the JVM will result 
in a joint Congo-Rwanda effort to deal with the FDLR 
problems.  End Note.)  Referring to an October 8 incident in 
Bukavu during which an angry crowd of approximately 1,000 
Congolese citizens threatened to burn Monuc peacekeepers 
transporting a supposed Rwandan, Swarbrick said that Monuc is 
seriously considering delaying the opening of the JVM office 
in Bukavu.  Swarbrick believes that particularly initially, 
with the low level of activity anticipated for the 
verification teams, it will be possible to conduct 
investigations in both North and South Kivu from the Goma JVM 
offices.  Then, he continued, Monuc could open the JVM office 
in Bukavu \"when things are calmer,\" although he declined to 
speculate on when that might be.  PolCouns noted the 
importance of opening both offices as planned, particularly 
in order that the international community not be seen to be 
intimidated by mob rule, which would further undercut Monuc\'s 
influence in South Kivu. 
 
3. (C)  Swarbrick went on to say that Monuc has informed both 
Rwanda and the DRC that it will not transport armed JVM team 
members.  Since the Monuc milobs who will accompanying the 
teams on their missions will be unarmed (consistent with 
Monuc\'s operational agreement), the JVM members likewise must 
be unarmed.  Swarbrick acknowledged there is a risk that 
unarmed JVM teams -- and milobs -- could potentially 
encounter armed and hostile parties in the course of their 
investigations, but said in that case, the teams would simply 
have to break off the investigation.  As of October 16, Monuc 
had not received replies to the work plan for the 
verification teams from either Rwanda or the DRC. 
 
Congolese -- High Hopes 
 
4. (C)  PolCouns spoke October 16 with Ambassador-at-Large 
Antoine Ghonda, the DRC\'s senior representative at the JVM 
meeting in Kigali.  Ghonda confirmed that he had received 
Monuc\'s proposed changes to the work plan and said that in 
principle, Congo has no objections to unarmed team members. 
He noted that the purpose of the teams is to investigate 
allegations with the objective of resolving problems, not 
firing on miscreants.  He insisted, however, that the work 
plan must state (as do the terms of reference agreed in New 
York) that the teams will investigate \"all allegations,\" not 
only those supplied by official government sources.  He added 
that, in light of the recent tensions surrounding the return 
of refugees from Burundi, the DRC hopes the JVM teams can 
also assist with the phased return of refugees both by 
generally improving confidence and security, and by 
investigating allegations that non-refugee elements might 
attempt to enter the Congo disguised as refugees. 
 
5. (C)  He confirmed the DRC wants the Rwandan team to stay 
each evening on the Rwandan side of the border.  While 
acknowledging the logistical problems this will pose (most 
allegations are received in the early morning hours, when the 
border is officially closed, which would prohibit Monuc\'s 
transporting the Rwandan team to the Congolese side, or vice 
versa), he said that the DRC is insisting on this measure to 
ensure the safety of the Rwandan team.  (Comment:  A tacit 
admission that the DRC cannot or will not guarantee the 
security of the Rwandan soldiers in Bukavu or Goma.  End 
Comment.)  Ghonda also said that others, such as Nigeria and 
South Africa, should be briefed on the JVM and its 
operations, speculating that perhaps in the future these two 
countries would wish to be involved \"in some capacity.\"  He 
said he had submitted his recommendations to the President 
for approval, but did not expect to receive a response before 
October 20, given that the President is making his first 
official visit to the East (Kisangani, reported septel). 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C)  Perhaps not surprisingly, there already is some delay 
in agreeing on the operational terms for the verification 
teams, and an attendant lag in opening the offices.  Monuc is 
hopeful, however, that by early November the JVM will be 
operational, in one form or another.  Increasingly, however, 
the limitations imposed by all the parties -- having to 
transport the Rwandans to and from Congo daily, Monuc\'s lack 
of night-vision equipment and boats, etc -- suggest that the 
JVM will have a hard time living up to expectations 
particularly if, as Swarbrick suggests, Monuc hopes the JVM 
will somehow lead to a solution for the long-standing problem 
of the FDLR.

1. (C) Summary.  In a high-stakes move to gain control of the 
DRC\'s parastatals, Vice President Bemba called for CIAT to 
arbitrate his longstanding dispute with the presidency. 
Bemba, who heads the transitional government\'s commission for 
economics and finance, maintains the power-sharing agreement 
signed at Sun City gives his commission the right to control 
the parastatals.  His position is apparently supported by the 
RCD/G and the political opposition who, like Bemba\'s MLC, are 
keen to get \"their share\" of the country\'s public 
enterprises.  The Presidency\'s position is that Sun City 
called for a sharing of political (not economic) powers, and 
that an independent commission should be constituted to 
appoint the directors of the country\'s parastatals -- a 
position likely to be supported by the international 
community.   Bemba has also called upon CIAT to decide which 
of the transitional government\'s component groups should have 
responsibility for territorial administration, the 
intelligence services, and the police.  In an October 14 
communique, CIAT called for \"consultations\" among the parties 
to resolve the dispute quickly so as not to jeopardize the 
transition and national elections \"expected by the Congolese 
people.\"  End summary. 
 
---------------- 
Bemba\'s Position 
---------------- 
2. (U) In an October 11 letter addressed to SRSG Swing, Vice 
President Jean-Pierre Bemba called upon CIAT to arbitrate and 
\"settle definitively\" the remaining questions related to the 
division of powers called for in the Global Accord. 
Specifically, he asked CIAT to decide which component should 
be given overall control of the country\'s parastatals. 
Putting the parastals in his economics and finance portfolio 
would, Bemba wrote, \"lead to economic reunification\" and \"end 
the multiplicity of structures\" relating to the management of 
public enterprises.  Bemba also asked for CIAT to arbitrate 
the division of powers relating to territorial 
administration, the intelligence services, and the police. 
 
3. (C)  Bemba\'s letter was (comment: not coincidentally) sent 
the day after SRSG Swing left the DRC for a long-planned 
working visit to Europe.  The issues raised in his letter 
were therefore added to the agenda of the regular CIAT 
meeting of October 14 presided over by Swing\'s deputy, 
Behrouz Sadry. Before the meeting, however, both Kabila\'s and 
Bemba\'s staffs heavily lobbied CIAT members.  Virtually all 
CIAT members were demarched by representatives of the 
government, and most CIAT members (but not the U.S.) were 
called in to meet with Bemba\'s senior advisers. 
 
4. (U) Bemba\'s letter referred to interventions in April and 
May when CIAT called upon the presidency to end the delays in 
dividing powers among the Transition\'s various component 
groups with the creation of an ad-hoc committee. 
Acknowledging that some issues had been resolved, Bemba also 
noted that a majority of the committee had agreed to assign 
control of the parastals to his portfolio -- a proposal 
rejected by the presidency.  In light of the stalemate, and 
citing Annex Four of the Global Accord as his justification, 
Bemba called for CIAT arbitration to resolve all pending 
issues. 
 
5. (C) Bemba\'s senior staff made it clear they expected a 
decision in Bemba\'s favor.  The British Ambassador, who was 
demarched on October 14, told Charge that Bemba\'s Chief of 
Staff had indicated that MLC supporters would likely 
demonstrate if a favorable decision was not forthcoming. 
Other CIAT chiefs of mission received similar messages about 
potential disturbances by those whose \"patience is running 
out.\" 
 
------------------------- 
The Presidency\'s Position 
------------------------- 
6.  (C) CIAT members were demarched on October 14 by either 
Chief of Staff Boshab, Ambassador-at-Large Kapanga, or 
Ambassador-at-Large Ghonda.  Charge and polcounselor were 
told by Kapanga the presidency strongly opposes 
\"politicization\" of public enterprises.  Kapanga said the 
Global Accord never envisaged transferring control of the 
parastatals to one component group, and that Sun City only 
called for the division of political powers (\"partage de 
responsabilities\") - not of economic ones such as parastatals 
(where the Accord called only for the appointment of 
managers).  He cited Article 198 which, in the presidency\'s 
interpretation, stipulates that the parastatals are to be 
left as is until after the elections.  Moreover, he claimed, 
this was discussed at Sun City and known by all parties. 
 
7.  (C) Kapanga said the presidency proposes to replace all 
current heads of Congolese parastals.  A committee would be 
established to select directors for the country\'s parastatals 
on the basis of their \"morality, competence, and experience,\" 
and not on the basis of their political affiliation.  The 
committee would be composed of representatives of the four 
\"composantes,\" the three \"entities,\" and national and 
international experts including the World Bank, the E.U., the 
UNDP, and the IMF.  Kapanga underscored that the parastatals 
constitute the patrimony of the Congolese people, and that 
politicizing their management was unacceptable. 
 
8.  (C) On the other areas, Kapanga said the police and 
intelligence services issues were already being dealt with, 
and that the presidency could compromise on the remaining 
issue related to territorial administration.  In that regard, 
he suggested that the Minister of Interior (from the 
president\'s component) and the Vice Minister of Plan (from 
the RCD) could work together to appoint local officials. 
(Note: Territorial administration does indeed fall in the 
category of \"political powers,\" and appointments of local 
officials have not been apportioned equitably.) 
 
---------- 
The Stakes 
---------- 
9. (C)  Control of the parastatals is potentially a lucrative 
proposition for the various factions in the transitional 
government, as the president\'s advisers have repeatedly 
pointed out. Though almost all of the parastatals are 
perpetual money-losers, they are also useful cash cows for 
the unscrupulous.  Salaries for senior managers are very 
high, and those appointed to such positions would be expected 
to share their good fortune with their political patrons. 
With elections on the horizon, the stakes are high.  An audit 
of the parastatals released this month provides clear 
evidence of mismanagement and waste, and the World Bank 
Resident Representative spoke out publicly on October 14 
against politicizing the parastatals. 
 
----------------------- 
CIAT\'s Interim Response 
----------------------- 
10.  (C) DSRSG Sadry told CIAT members at the October 14 
meeting he had been advised that a separate request for 
arbitration was to be submitted by the RCD.  There was 
consensus that any arbitration at the October 14 meeting was 
therefore premature.   Instead, CIAT agreed to consultations 
with the various parties with the aim of reaching an 
\"operational consensus...in a climate of mutual trust.\"   The 
communique \"took note\" of Bemba\'s letter, but did not comment 
on its substance.  In discussions at the meeting, however, it 
was agreed that the division of powers for the police and 
intelligence services were side issues.   Members expressed 
their concerns about politicizing the parastatals and their 
resolve not to be rushed into arbitration. 
 
11. (C) Within the transitional government, both sides read 
into the communique want they wanted.  Bemba\'s faction 
interpreted it to mean that CIAT would arbitrate (and 
presumably had seen merit in Bemba\'s argument), and 
polcounselor was told by MONUC that Bemba\'s chief of staff 
has been calling daily to ask about the status of the case. 
For its part, the presidency has been surprisingly successful 
in the media, where newspapers that usually are not friendly 
to the government, have editorialized that the parastals 
should not be put under political control. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
12. (C) Though it would be naive to believe the presidency is 
making its case on the parastatals solely in the interest of 
transparency and good governance, it nevertheless is on the 
right side of this issue.  The three other component groups 
in the transition government very much want to get \"their 
share\" of the parastatals, with the objective of milking 
whatever they can out of them while there is still time. 
CIAT will of course soon have to address the issue directly, 
and is all too aware of Bemba\'s none-too-veiled threats if he 
doesn\'t get his way.  End comment.

1. (SBU) Summary.  CIAT members agreed to request a meeting 
with Vice President Bemba to discuss the Finance Ministry\'s 
refusal to release $3.6 million provided by the French to 
support election preparations.  A selected delegation of CIAT 
chiefs of mission will ask Bemba, who heads the transitional 
government\'s economics and finance commission, to unblock 
funds urgently needed by the Independent Electoral 
Commission.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) At its regular weekly meeting of October 14, CIAT 
discussed Vice President Bemba\'s request for arbitration 
regarding control of the parastatals (reftel), as well as 
preparations for local, parliamentary, and presidential 
elections.  The president of the Independent Electoral 
Commission, Abbe Apollinaire Malu Malu, briefed CIAT members 
on the work of his commission. 
 
3.  (C) Malu Malu indicated that the Commission\'s greatest 
immediate challenge is to set up offices outside of Kinshasa 
and to hire staff.   Unfortunately, he said, the Commission\'s 
work has come to a standstill since it has received no 
funding from the Finance Ministry.  No funds from the GDRC 
have been transferred, nor has funding provided by donor 
countries been released.   Malu Malu indicated that a letter 
from the head of state ordering funds to be released had been 
sent, but that the letter had \"no effect.\"  (Note: Charge and 
polcounselor were told separately on October 14 by 
Ambassador-at-Large Kapangaa that such a letter had been 
sent.  Signed by President Kabila, it was sent directly to 
Vice President Kabila.) 
 
4.  (SBU) The French Ambassador underscored that $3.6 million 
has been transferred by his government for use by the 
Commission.  It has not been released by the Finance 
Ministry, however, and CIAT is therefore requesting 
clarification from Bemba. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  It is unclear why the release of the French 
contribution has been blocked.  It seems likely that it has 
to do with a power play on Bemba\'s part at a time when he is 
calling upon CIAT to arbitrate in his favor on the control of 
parastatals.  Whatever the reason for the non-release of the 
funds, it is significantly slowing preparations for elections 
slated to take place in a matter of months.   End comment.

 1. (C)  Presidential Advisor and Special Ambassador Andre 
Kapanga told PolCouns October 18 that he and Foreign Minister 
Ramazani (possibly with other government officials) will be 
visiting China the first week of November, followed by a 
4-day visit to North Korea.  Kapanga said the delegation will 
try to encourage improved trade with and investment in the 
DRC by China, but seemed almost embarrassed when PolCouns 
asked what Congo could get from North Korea, and gave no 
clear answer except to assure her that the DRC certainly does 
not intend to sell anything like uranium to the North Koreans. 
 
2. (C)  China has long had a very visible presence in the 
DRC:  aside from its Embassy, there is also a relatively 
large (200-300 man) engineering battalion in Bukavu attached 
to the UN Mission to the Congo (MONUC).  This detachment is 
ostensibly responsible for maintaining the road to the 
airport, which is frequently washed out, but the deplorable 
condition of the road substantiates comments by Bukavu Monuc 
personnel that \"no one knows what they are doing out there.\" 
In addition, there are numerous reports of Chinese (or other 
asian) individuals in Katanga province, near the Shinkolobwe 
mine, and recently Chinese businessmen have been visiting 
Lumbambashi, the Katangan capital.  It is possible that the 
government simply wants to officially capture its revenue 
share of the resource traffic which already probably is 
leaving Congo en route to China.  The same does not, however, 
apply to North Korea, which remains, at best, a very strange 
destination for this delegation.

1. (C) During the course of an introductory courtesy call by 
the Ambassador on Minister of Environment, Anselme Enerunga, 
the Minister detoured into a discussion of internal DRC 
politics. Enerunga, who headed the Mai-Mai delegations in 
Pretoria and Sun City, expressed concern that the Mai Mai are 
being marginalized by some in the Presidency. He claimed 
there were rumors being spread that the Mai-Mai had plotted 
to assassinate Kabila and topple the government. 
 
2. (C) Enerunga stated that many Congolese politicians are 
fearful of the Mai-Mai because they resisted the Rwandans. 
Their \"patriotic\" resistance makes them popular with the 
Congolese and thus a threat to the rest. This was the cause 
of the unfounded rumors of a plot against Kabila. Enerunga 
also alluded to further designs against the Mai-Mai, claiming 
that the Rwandans orchestrate attacks on Banyamulenge simply 
to blame the Mai-Mai for massacres in the Eastern DRC. 
Additionally, he mentioned having had conversations with 
President Kabila in which Kabila questioned the Mai-Mai\'s 
motives and accused them of being killers. Enerunga attempted 
to assure the Ambassador that the Mai-Mai do not want to 
disrupt the transition in any way. 
 
3. (C) Comment. Enerunga\'s commentary was colored by 
affirmations of Mai-Mai patriotism and committment to the 
transition. He specifically noted that the Mai-Mai lacked a 
\"foreign\" supporter (such as Rwanda, Uganda, Angola or 
Zimbabwe). His comments also made it clear, however, that 
contrary to some perceptions all is not well for Mai-Mai 
relations within the government, and specifically with the 
Presidency. Enerunga spent most of the time suggesting that 
the USG and the CIAT should support the Mai-Mai in the 
transitional government. The Mai-Mai are not represented at 
high levels in the current government (2 ministers and one 
vice-minister) and were not pleased with the reorganization 
that took place in August. The Mai-Mai are clearly feeling 
marginalized and are reaching out for international support.

Classified By: Ambassador Roger Meece for Reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: In October 21 remarks to the International 
Committee to Accompany the Transition (CIAT), U.N. 
Peacekeeping Under Secretary Guehenno said that his visit to 
the DRC was intended to review how MONUC could best utilize 
its limited resources.  Overall, the U.N.,s obective is to 
ensure a credible electoral process, and establish a sound 
foundation for the post-electoral period.  Guehenno 
emphasized that the unity and continued engagement of the 
international community is also an essential component to 
keep the DRC,s transition on track.  The  British, French, 
Belgian and U.S. Ambassadors discussed with Guehenno in an 
earlier meeting the need to move Congolese politicians to 
understand the need for some degree of power-sharing in a 
successful political system.  During his visit, Guehenno 
generally seemed to maintain a positive tone, albeit with 
occasional references to the UNSC,s failure to embrace fully 
the SYG,s recommendations for MONUC expansion.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  U.N. Under Secretary for Peacekeeping Operation 
Jean-Marie Guehenno concluded a five day visit to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with an October 21 
meeting with the 17 member International Committee to 
Accompany the Transition (CIAT).  In his remarks to the CIAT, 
Guehenno observed that the most recent resolution of the U.N. 
Security Council, UNSC Res. 1565 authorizing a 5,900 person 
expansion of MONUC, did not provide all the resources to do 
everything requested of MONUC.  His visit was therefore 
designed to discuss with UN SRSG Bill Swing, his staff, and 
GDRC officials how best to utilize the resources that will be 
available. 
 
3. (SBU) Guehenno stated that the U.N.,s overall objective 
in the DRC is to ensure a credible electoral process, and 
establish a solid foundation for the post-electoral period. 
This means that there is a political process that must run in 
parallel with election preparations to ensure that successful 
elections can be held and the results respected.  In 
addition, it is important to see progress in the security 
environment. 
 
4. (SBU)  Guehenno also emphasized that the unity of the 
international community be maintained as much as possible. 
This has already been demonstrated as an essential component 
to keep the DRC transition process on track, and is most 
visible in the CIAT.  Guehenno noted in this regard that the 
September 22 senior-level meeting of CIAT members in New York 
had represented a useful symbolic reinforcement of 
international community engagement and common intent. 
Guehenno elaborated by noting several areas where strong 
continued international engagement, and often pressure, is 
needed.  Among the specific areas Guehenno identified was 
security sector reform, including disarmament and 
reintegration/repatration programs, much of which is still 
lacking resources and political will within parts of the 
GDRC.    Building a viable police structure is another area. 
 
5. (SBU) The overall election process remains the centerpiece 
of the transition, but Guehenno underscored that even 
successful elections per se will not solve all problems. 
Nonetheless, significant progress in elections planning as 
well as in associated areas has been seen.  Guehenno observed 
that there are strong popular expectations in the DRC about 
elections, and major delays run the risk of a explosive 
negative reaction. 
 
6. (C) Guehenno observed that CIAT ambassadors have a dual 
role, accredited in a traditional role as representatives of 
their governments to the President and GDRC government, but 
also in this case acting as representatives to the full 
&Espace Presidentiel8 (note: President Kabila plus four 
Vice Presidents who represent the range of political 
components participating in the transition process). 
Guehenno also spoke of MONUC,s intent to facilitate 
establishment of three CIAT thematic commissions consistent 
with the recent DRC discussions in New York.  These are to 
deal with elections, security sector reform, and needed 
legislation, which includes preparation of a proposed new 
constitution. 
 
7. (C) Briefly summarizing MONUC\'s immediate plans regarding 
expansion, Guehenno reported that 3 brigades are to be 
assigned to the eastern portion of the country (Ituri 
district and the two Kivu provinces).  A new field 
headquarters is to be established in Kisangani for the east, 
which will also have a reserve element.  New forces are 
expected to arrive over the next three months.  Regarding the 
foreign armed forces, i.e. ex-FAR, Interahamwe and the FLDR, 
it will be MONUC,s intent to deploy forces to areas now 
considered relatively easy for these groups to disrupt or 
\"destabilize\" their operations, providing a greater 
opportunity for success for FARDC operations to &spark8 a 
new wave of disarmament and repatriations to Rwanda. 
 
8. (C) During a question and answer period, SRSG Swing 
reported that the Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM) 
implementation between the DRC and Rwanda had been delayed 
because of the high level of tension in South Kivu occasioned 
by the unexpected return of large number of Congolese 
refugees from Burundi.  Among the various protests, a MONUC 
APC which had broken down in Bukavu had been attacked by a 
mob (note: as reported in Embassy and DATT reporting). 
MONUC,s judgment was the risk of an incident with Rwandan 
officers in the DRC was too high in the immediate aftermath 
of these problems.  Nonetheless, he intended for JVM 
operations to get underway before the end of the month. 
Swing reported that he is scheduled to meet October 22 with 
Rwandan JVM representative Amb. Richard Sezibera, currently 
in Kinshasa participating in planning for the November Great 
Lakes Conference, and with GDRC representative Amb. Antoine 
Ghonda to discuss the issue. 
 
9. (C) The French Ambassador hosted an October 20 breakfast 
for Guehenno with the British, Belgian, and U.S. Ambassadors, 
as well as SRSG Swing.  During the breakfast, the four 
Ambassadors discussed with Guehenno the importance of moving 
the Congolese away from the traditional model characterized 
by \"one man\" politics and \"winner controls all\" mentality to 
some understanding of the need for power sharing in 
successful political systems.  While this is difficult to do, 
and certainly many in the DRC political class are locked in 
to the old style of thinking, there is a very broad desire to 
get away from the Mobutu-style system, and there are some 
glimmers of more enlightened thinking.  It will be important 
for all engaged players, including MONUC and concerned 
members of the international community to assist political 
leaders to understand that they have a stake in a successful 
transition process, including elections. 
 
10. (C) Comment:  At least in his comments to foreign 
diplomats, Guehenno did not break much new ground, 
reiterating what is already accepted general MONUC policy 
consistent with that of the CIAT.  He generally maintained a 
positive tone, albeit interspersed with occasional references 
to the UNSC,s failure to embrace fully the SYG,s 
recommendations for a much bigger expansion of the MONUC 
operation and mandate.  Guehenno,s visit was scheduled only 
at the last minute, and he may well have had other agendas as 
well internal to MONUC.  From our perspective, IO A/S Holmes 
is fortuitously scheduled for a five-day visit with arrival 
in Kinshasa on October 28, providing us a good opportunity to 
follow up regarding current MONUC plans and operations, and 
to underscore USG views.  End comment.

SUBJECT: EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS PROMPT CENTRAL BANK 
INTERVENTION 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. The Congolese Franc (FC) has suffered from 
mild instability for the past two months, declining in value 
by 12 percent. The Congolese Central Bank has directly 
intervened to the tune of USD 37 million and has raised 
interest rates over the past month. The impact on the formal 
sector so far has been light. The informal sector and the 
average Congolese have been particularly hard hit, however. 
The exchange rate has appreciated slightly. Exchange rate and 
inflation changes could have complicating effects on GDRC/IMF 
budget planning. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) After one year of stability, the Congolese Franc 
depreciated by approximately 12 percent over the months of 
August and September, reaching a value of FC 430-440 to the 
USD. Decreased international diamond prices and increased 
international oil prices have contributed to decreased 
retention of USD within the local economy. At the same time, 
workers were quickly converting salaries paid in FC to USD to 
pay school fees which come due in September. 
 
3. (U) The net effects on the local economy is increased 
prices for a variety of goods and services. Those items 
normally paid for in USD (or which rely on petroleum 
products, e.g. gasoline) experienced the strongest increase, 
such as rent (29 percent) and public transportation (25 
percent). Some staple food items, such as frozen fish (22 
percent), milk (14 percent) and corn (17.6 percent), were 
also hard hit. The Embassy price survey is now registering a 
6 percent year-to-date increase in prices and expects 
inflation to go above the 6 percent target set by the Central 
Bank (BCC) and the IMF. 
 
4. (SBU) The BCC, with the support of the IMF, has undertaken 
a policy of active intervention in the currency market to 
stabilize the Congolese Franc. The BCC has: 
 
--Directly intervened to the tune of USD 37 million in three 
tranches (USD 7 million, USD 5 million and USD 25 million) 
over the past two months to remove excess FC from circulation. 
 
--Raised the interbank loan rate (Note. This is more similar 
to our Federal Funds Rate. End Note.) from 9 percent to 11 
percent (a 22 percent increase). 
 
--Increased the treasury bond rate to an average of 33 
percent to attract purchasers. 
 
5. (SBU) Citibank Congo stated that the intervention was 
needed because money expansion during the months of August 
and September overshot the projected growth figures of 4-5 
percent and instead reached 12-13 percent, largely due to the 
factors listed above as well as some speculative activity. 
Citibank VP Michel Losembe also noted that the BCC is sitting 
on comfortable foreign exchange reserves, enough to finance 
export-import flows for 8-9 months. 
 
6. (SBU) The BCC\'s actions have helped to appreciate the 
exchange rate to a national average of 410-420. IMF ResRep 
Arend Kouwenaar commented to econoff that the exchange rate 
was overvalued at FC380 and needed to depreciate slightly to 
about 400-410. The GDRC recently changed its exchange rate 
assumptions for the FY2005 budget from FC 380 to FC 415 to 
reflect the changing monetary conditions. The other 
macroeconomic assumptions of 5-6 percent inflation and 6-7 
percent growth remain the same. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment. While the exchange rate appears to be 
stabilizing at 410-420, seasonal depreciation often occurs 
around the Christmas Holidays. In the short term, however, 
the BCC\'s intervention, with support from the IMF, seems to 
have been successful. End Comment.

SUBJECT: KIMBERLEY PROCESS VISIT TO DRC PROVIDES 
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1747 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.4 b/d 
 
1. (SBU) Summary. At the request of the DRC government, a 
Kimberley Process review team visited the DRC in October. 
Although the GDRC has made some progress, it is not in full 
compliance with Kimberley Process regulations. There are 
still serious holes in the DRC\'s Kimberley Process system, 
and an estimated 40 percent of production is smuggled 
undocumented. Some government agencies involved in the 
Kimberley Process are functioning well, but the political 
will to maintain them and improve other offices is lacking. 
The review team was very open with the international 
community. It signaled that it will likely give balanced 
criticism of GDRC compliance, and that it recognizes the 
DRC\'s importance to the international diamond trade. End 
Summary. 
 
TEAM COMPOSITION 
 
2. (SBU) The Kimberley Process (KP) review team came to the 
DRC at the request of the Congolese goverment from Oct 11 to 
15. This is a positive and proactive step showing DRC 
willingness to achieve compliance with international norms. 
The review team consisted of Team Director Ambassador David 
Viveash (Canada), Mark Van Bockstael (Antwerp High Diamond 
Council), Kim Eling (European Commission), Jacqueline Lenka 
(South Africa Diamond Board), Abdoul Wahab Diakhaby (Guinean 
National Diamond and Precious Materials Bureau), and Emily 
Bild (Global Witness). The team granted ample briefing time 
to the international community, holding a COM dinner at the 
beginning of the visit and a diplomatic community outbrief at 
the end. Econoff, along with one British and one Canadian 
diplomat, travelled with the team to the interior of the DRC. 
(Note: Both DCM and econoff were told the USG was slated to 
lead this review visit. Due to the apparent unavailability of 
a USG participant, Canada agreed to head the delegation. DCM 
and Econoff were both asked about the lack of USG 
participation. End note.) 
 
THE POSITIVES 
 
3. (SBU) Organizing and educating artisanal miners will be 
key to tracking the source of diamonds and to providing 
miners with opportunities for economic development. The 
Service d\'Assistance et d\'Encadrement du Small Scale Mining 
(Saesscam) could be instrumental in this role, according to 
the KP team. They were impressed by Saesscam\'s ability to 
organize 23 cooperatives (50 percent of which are owned by 
expats) of small scale miners, usually working with dredges 
on rivers. Saesscam also is attempting to provide some 
business and safety training to the small scale and artisanal 
miners in the Kasais. At present, Saesscam does not have 
sufficient funds to fully deploy. As the number of 
cooperatives grow, however, so will Saesscam\'s receipts. 
Saesscam charges a fee for its services, which, beyond 
organizing the cooperatives, include monitoring of operations 
and safeguarding and transfer of diamonds. 
 
4. (C) Cadastre Minier (Cami) is the body that processes and 
registers mining and exploration titles. Its effectiveness is 
necessary for orderly development of the mining sector as it 
avoids chaotic licensing. The KP team cited Cami as a 
positive example of a well-functioning government 
institution. Van Bockstael forecasted, however, that within 
one year Cami will not function anymore because it works too 
well. (Comment: Cami has already been the subject of 
political attacks from the Minister of Mines. The Minister 
sacked the head of Cami, Ambroise Mbaka, during Summer 2004. 
Mbaka claimed the Minister did this because he would not give 
preferential treatment to a friend of the Minister in 
processing an application. Cami was also efficiently 
processing exploration and mining title applications to the 
point that the applications were piling up on the Minister\'s 
desk. If, after a period of 30 days, the Minister does not 
sign the titles, they automatically are accepted. There is 
speculation that the Minister did not like the restriction - 
as it limited his ability to \"treat\" each case - and thus, in 
August, prohibited Cami from accepting any new applications. 
End comment.) 
 
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS 
 
5. (C) The KP team was uncertain if the system of 
acknowledgement of receipt of certificates is working well, 
or if the GDRC is following up on unconfirmed Kimberley 
Process Certificates (KPCs). The GDRC only gave half answers 
to the Kimberley Process team regarding statistical 
discrepancies in KPC reporting, according to Van Bockstael. 
Several certificates have arrived in Europe and Israel that 
have not been recorded in the DRC. Four countries from 
2003-2004 have reported exporting rough diamonds to the DRC, 
for which the DRC has no records. 
 
6. (C) Illegal leakages of diamonds cause 40 percent of DRC 
production (by value) not to be captured within the KP 
system. This discrepancy cannot be reconciled with the 
numbers from Congo-Brazzaville, which was accused of 
smuggling USD 350 million per year of diamonds from the DRC. 
(Note. Brazzaville was removed from the Kimberley Process in 
June 2004. KP participant countries are no longer allowed to 
trade in diamonds with Congo-Brazzaville. End Note.) 
According to Van Bockstael, the majority of diamonds (by 
value) traded in Brazzaville were from Angola and were 
smuggled through the DRC. The Congolese diamonds traded in 
Brazzaville were largely from Mbuji Mayi and did not reach 
the 40 percent (by value) figure. The sharp increase in 
exports from the DRC in July was essentially a shock while 
the diamond dealers moved to beat the learning curve and find 
new export channels. Eling noted that the KP cannot blame the 
DRC for having porous borders. The question should be focused 
on whether smuggling is part of the system. Team members were 
dismayed that while the GDRC was very concerned about 
leakages of its own diamonds, it had no interest at all in 
dealing with diamonds from neighboring countries which leak 
into the DRC. 
 
7. (C) Political wrangling around the control of the diamond 
trade inhibits the development of a strong tracking and 
evaluation system in compliance with KP regulations. The 
competition between the Minister of Mines, Eugene Diomi 
Ndongala, and the CEEC was evident at both the Kinshasa and 
provincial levels. Each tried to upstage the other in 
presentations, to the point of even hosting competing dinners 
for the team the same evening. This institutional tension is 
complicated by the diffuse structure of institutional roles 
in the diamond sector. Both Eling and Van Bockstael referred 
to the Aug/Sept 2003 gaffe by Minister of Mines Diomi where 
he accused Miba of fraudulently exporting USD 10 million of 
diamonds to the UK. This was because the Vice-Minister of 
Mines, in place of the Minister, signed the KPC for the 
shipment. The KP team has specifically asked the GDRC to 
clarify how many signatures are the minimum and who are the 
authorized signatories for the KPCs. Furthermore, some 
responsibilities are replicated, such as the presence of the 
Mining Administration in comptoirs at the same time as a CEEC 
representative (reftel). 
 
TRAVEL TO THE INTERIOR 
 
8. (C) Econoff accompanied the team to Mbuji Mayi and 
Tshikapa on Oct 12-13. The meetings in Mbuji Mayi generally 
 
SIPDIS 
revolved around Miniere de Bakwanga (Miba - the diamond 
parastatal). Team members were generally not impressed by 
Miba\'s facilities or its growth plans. Security was spotty in 
the sorting room and equipment was substandard and 
antiquated. Not one member of the senior management team of 
Miba was present during the visit. Besides meeting with Miba 
and regional CEEC and Ministry of Mines authorities, the KP 
team visited several comptoirs in both Mbuji Mayi and 
Tshikapa. The GDRC made a strong effort to round up miners 
 
SIPDIS 
and negotiants with government-required ID cards to 
demonstrate that diamonds are being tracked through an ID 
system. There were two comptoirs in Mbuji Mayi that were 
accepting diamonds from sellers (be they miners or 
negotiants) without identification. (Comment: What was 
troubling in those instances was that the CEEC and Mining 
Administration representatives were present and were not even 
enforcing the minimum standard of ID cards. They let the 
transactions take place regardless. End comment.) 
 
KIMBERLEY PROCESS AS AN ASSISTANCE BODY 
 
9. (SBU) One of the topics raised at the outbrief for the 
international community was the use of the Kimberley Process 
as an assistance body. Ambassador Viveash stated that the KP 
does not have the funding necessary to provide technical 
assistance on its own but it encourages Western donor nations 
to direct funding to projects to improve compliance with 
Kimberley Process regulations. Mark Van Bockstael noted that 
the KP is beginning to look at the idea of technical 
assistance and will soon hold seminars on KP implementation 
and \"Diamonds for Development.\" He also stated that the KP 
could become a clearing house for ideas to channel to donors. 
OTHER OBSERVATIONS 
 
10. (C) Van Bockstael was concerned that the DRC continues to 
have a production quota for the comptoirs of USD 30 million 
per month (total for all comptoirs). This encourages cheating 
because when DRC production drops slightly the comptoirs must 
source their diamonds from Angola to meet the quota. Removing 
the production quota would allow greater purchasing and 
cashflow flexibility to the comptoirs while opening the 
market to other firms that may not be able to strongly 
contribute to the quota. 
 
11. (SBU) Van Bockstael noted that Mbuji Mayi is rising in 
importance in the international diamond trade because. the 
industrial quality stones of the type found in Mbuji Mayi are 
only found in one other mine in the world, the Argyle Mine in 
Australia. The Argyle mine is extremely mature and will 
likely be exhausted in the next 5-7 years. The Indian diamond 
polishing industry, which relies on these industrial quality 
diamonds, has become a multi-billion dollar business and will 
force a shift in purchasing from Australia to Antwerp or 
direct from the DRC to gain access to the stones it desires. 
Production in Mbuji Mayi will have to increase to meet the 
demand from India. Investment should begin to grow regardless 
of DRC internal political conditions. 
 
12. (C) One of the new smuggling methods mentioned by Van 
Bockstael was the use of KPCs as transit documents. For 
example, a diamond shipment and accompanying DRC certificate 
could be sent to Switzerland. Once in Switzerland, the owner 
of the parcel could transform the diamonds to a banking 
transaction (rather than a mineral export) and move the 
diamonds to a non-participant country. (Note: Van Bockstael, 
Eling and Viveash all noted that Switzerland is close to 
being removed from the KP rolls if it does not stop this sort 
of activity. End note.) 
 
COMMENTS 
 
13. (C) Comment: The KP review team came to make sure that 
the Kimberley Process continues in the DRC, not to chastise 
GDRC performance. The DRC is not in full compliance with 
Kimberley Process regulations. The DRC\'s rising importance in 
the international diamond trade, however, makes it impossible 
and unwise to remove the country from the Kimberley Process. 
The KP team recognized the difficult internal political 
conditions that exist, and are of the opinion that the DRC 
system is, and will be for a long time, a work in progress. 
Recommendations will likely focus on clarifying internal 
divisions of labor and on increasing traceability from mine 
to comptoir. Unfortunately, the structures of the KP system 
and the institutions which work well (CEEC, Saesscam and 
Cami) are all under attack by competing political interests. 
Though the GDRC appears very engaged and willing to listen to 
the recommendations given by the KP, follow-through, as 
determined by momentary political necessities, will likely be 
spotty. End Comment.

SUBJECT: KABILA FUMING AT BELGIAN FONMIN COMMENTS 
 
REF: BRUSSELS 4517 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.4 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  President Kabila has temporarily recalled 
his ambassador from Brussels, as a sign of displeasure with 
recent comments by the Belgian foreign minister.  The ongoing 
spat does us no good, because the USG and Belgium share many 
of the same goals in the DRC.  Still, the Belgian/DRC 
relationship has long been characterized by strong if mixed 
feelings on both sides, and bilateral relations will survive. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) In the wake of Belgian foreign minister De Gucht\'s 
criticism of Congolese political leaders (reftel), President 
Kabila\'s special adviser Andre Kapanga told polcouns October 
21 the GDRC has decided to recall its ambassador in Brussels 
for \"indefinite consultations.\"  According to Kapanga, Kabila 
previously rejected the idea but decided on it because local 
press reported that the Belgian ambassador in Kinshasa 
publicly expressed support for De Gucht\'s statements in a 
press interview on October 19.  (Comment:  One Kinshasa 
newspaper ran an article claiming this, but it\'s unclear that 
the Belgian ambassador actually did so.  End Comment.) 
 
3. (C) Kapanga told polcouns previously, on October 19, that 
Kabila was furious at De Gucht\'s remarks and had railed that 
the Belgians \"lack respect for the Congo,\" and \"want to treat 
us as a colony, not a partner.\"   The source said Kabila also 
questioned rhetorically whether or not the DRC should 
consider curtailing its cooperation with Belgium. Another 
source told DCM separately that Kabila called one of his 
ambassadors-at-large, Antoine Ghonda, the evening of October 
16 to express his anger about De Gucht\'s remarks.  The 
Belgian ambassador told Ambassador October 20 he had already 
had a \"conversation\" (as opposed to being convoked) with 
Congolese foreign minister Raymond Ramazani and Kabila\'s 
diplomatic adviser Andre Kapanga to talk about De Gucht\'s 
\"injurious\" comments. 
 
4. (U) Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt reportedly 
telephoned Kabila on October 22 to express support for the 
transition and presumably help smooth ruffled feathers, and 
in return Kabila clarified that he was not \"recalling\" his 
ambassador.  (Note:  Ramazani explained in an interview with 
Radio Okapi the same day that the ambassador was merely 
coming back for consultations, a \"normal\" diplomatic 
procedure.  End Note.)  Also on October 22, Congolese 
information minister Henri Mova Sakanyi issued a blistering 
statement, accusing De Gucht of \"racism\" and likening him to 
the Belgian comic-book hero Tintin.  The Kinshasa press has 
continued to cover the controversy.  Pro-Kabila papers have 
highlighted other Belgians\' criticism of De Gucht, whereas 
other dailies (several of which support opposition figure 
Etienne Tshisekedi) have praised De Gucht for speaking \"the 
truth.\" 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) Kabila is clearly miffed at De Gucht\'s comments, which 
were particularly stinging since he lambasted the DRC while 
in Rwanda.  The decision to recall the Congolese ambassador 
from Brussels probably reflects Kabila\'s thin skin (though 
modest, he has bristled before at the notion he is not 
presidential material), as well as a means of  deflecting 
criticism from internal opponents such as Tshisekedi. 
Another possible explanation--advanced by Belgian 
diplomats--is that some among Kabila\'s entourage are 
deliberately seeking to create an issue in order to boost 
their own standing.  Because Belgium is a key U.S. partner in 
the DRC\'s transition and shares many of the same goals, the 
ongoing spat does us no good.  Still, the Belgian/DRC 
relationship has long been characterized by strong if mixed 
feelings on both sides and bilateral relations will survive.

Q. Evidence of Fluency in Written and Oral English: 
  Personal Interview with Public Affairs Officer.  I 
  interviewed Professor Tshibambe in depth.  His spoken 
  English and comprehension are fine.  His written 
  English reflects some minor errors that are almost 
  universal in the DRC, but it is more than adequate 
  for participation in this Institute. 
 
R. Statement by commission/post justifying participation 
of the candidate in the subject institute: 
 
As Professor Tshibambe notes in his statement, he and 
his department are teaching some of the basics of U.S. 
foreign policy in some of the courses they offer. 
Participation in this Institute will allow for an 
expansion of what the Department can offer regarding 
U.S. foreign policy, including I hope a basic course 
devoted to U.S. foreign policy.  As Chairman of the 
International Relations Department, Professor Tshibambe 
has a great deal of influence over the courses offered 
by the Department.  Accordingly, participation in this 
Institute will be of great benefit both in terms of the 
courses Professor Tshibambe teaches himself and in terms 
of courses he can help his colleagues develop. 
 
The University of Lubumbashi is second in size to the 
University of Kinshasa, but in many ways the University 
of Lubumbashi is the key institution of higher learning 
in the DRC.  The University of Lubumbashi was considered 
the center of higher education in the Mobutu era.  It 
remains better organized than the University of Kinshasa 
and the overall quality of the faculty is somewhat 
better than that of the University of Kinshasa. 
 
We have been working with the University of Lubumbashi 
to expand the scope and quality of American Studies at 
that institution.  Other professors at the University of 
Lubumbashi have benefited from participation in 
Fulbright Institutes and in the American Studies seminar 
held in Dakar.  Participation by Professor Tshibambe in 
this Institute will constitute a valuable contribution 
to this ongoing process. 
 
It goes without saying that the DRC plays a key role in 
the stability of Central Africa and for that matter for 
all of sub-Saharan Africa.  Anything we can do to 
improve the quality of teaching and research in U.S. 
foreign policy will benefit our interests as well. 
 
 
S. Relevance of the Program to the professional 
  duties of the candidate: 
 
  In my University, I am giving courses among which are 
  Theories of International Relations and Foreign 
  Policy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  In 
  the first course, I am dealing with the End of the 
  Cold War and the New Threats to International 
  Security.  I will up-date my courses with the 
  knowledge gained from participating in this program. 
  The impact of my participation is strong in so far as 
  I am guiding students (as Director for their research 
  work) who are dealing with the issues related of 
  United States\'s post Cold War foreign policy.  In 
  order to avoid such considerations of US imperialism 
  since September 11, 2001, my participation in the 
  program will help me understand the fundamental 
  motivations of U.S. foreign policy in this turbulent 
  era. 
 
  Nowadays, with the war waged in Iraq and the post-war 
  difficulties that United States of America are 
  facing, there is strong trend of anti-Americanism 
  throughout the world, and specifically in Third World 
  countries.  This attitude is mainly nourished by the 
  fact that the United States is powerful and is like a 
  bird flying in the sky.  To reappraise my view, this 
  trend should le met me know \"at the grassroots\" the 
  feeling and the aspirations of the American people 
  since the event of September 11.  My sty in the US

SUBJECT: RCD-GOMA STICKS UP FOR RENEGADE OFFICERS 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  A senior RCD-Goma leader complained to the 
Ambassador that his faction had been excluded from the 
DRC/Uganda/Rwanda tripartite process.  He also said the two 
renegade officers who led the May-June mutiny in Bukavu 
should not be considered in the same league as other official 
enemies such as the ex-FAR/Interahamwe.  In our view, they 
are both very clearly enemies not just of the transitional 
government, but also of the Congolese civilian population. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Moise Nyarugabo, a leading member of the RCD-Goma 
movement, told the Ambassador October 25 that President 
Kabila\'s and Vice-President Bemba\'s factions had excluded the 
RCD-Goma from the months-old trilateral DRC/Uganda/Rwanda 
talks and process.  Nyarugabo said he understood the draft 
trilateral document includes a list of designated \"negative 
forces,\" such as the ex-FAR/Interahamwe, but complained that 
renegade officers Gen. Laurent Nkunda and Col. Jules Mutebusi 
should not be in the same category as the others.  If they 
are to be included, at least put them in a separate 
paragraph, he argued.  Also, Nkunda and Mutebusi are the only 
ones on the list to be cited individually--if the document 
names them, then other groups such as the FDLR should have 
their leaders names specified as well.  Nyarugabo added that 
the RCD-Goma sent Jean-Marie Emungu (chief of staff to 
RCD-Goma leader Azarias Ruberwa) to attend the October 25-26 
round of tripartite talks in Kigali.  In response, the 
Ambassador pointed out that Nkunda and Mutebusi quite clearly 
represented threats to the stability of the region and the 
transition process.  In addition, he noted, Nyarugabo\'s 
objections seemed to be coming very late in the day, on the 
eve of signature of the agreement and long after the draft 
text had been prepared. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT:  Nkunda\'s and Mutebusi\'s troops raped and 
pillaged their way through Bukavu in June 2004, and Nkunda 
himself is widely reported to have been a leading figure in 
the May 2002 Kisangani massacre.  In our view, they are both 
very clearly enemies not just of the transitional government, 
but also of the Congolese civilian population.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: OPPOSITION FIGURE TSHISEKEDI KEEPING HIS OPTIONS 
OPEN 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  A close adviser to opposition figure Etienne 
Tshisekedi, leader of the UDPS party, confirmed that the UDPS 
 
SIPDIS 
is no longer allied with the RCD-Goma and maintains informal 
links with Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s MLC.  In our view, while a 
Tshisekedi-Bemba alliance during the upcoming elections is 
 
SIPDIS 
certainly possible, we are less likely to see President 
Kabila teaming up with the UDPS leader. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Jean-Joseph Mukendi, a close adviser to opposition 
figure Etienne Tshisekedi told poloff October 27 that 
Tshisekedi\'s political party, the Union for Democracy and 
 
SIPDIS 
Social Progress (UDPS), has not had a formal alliance with 
the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD-Goma) movement since 
late 2003.  The UDPS does support RCD-Goma views on certain 
issues, however, such as nationality.  Tshisekedi is also in 
touch with members of Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s Congo Liberation 
Movement (MLC), and in fact Bemba recently invited the UDPS 
leader to a formal dinner, although Tshisekedi declined.  The 
UDPS expects upcoming elections, set for June 2005, to be all 
about alliance-building, and is keeping its options open for 
now. 
 
3. (C) Mukendi said that although there is still a continuing 
dispute over UDPS legality under the new law on political 
parties, adopted in early 2004, it is not a serious challenge 
and lower-level authorities have not harassed UDPS members at 
all.  He added that the UDPS\' main agenda item for the near 
future is to hold a party congress in February 2005, and 
Tshisekedi does not plan to travel anywhere before then. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
4. (C) COMMENT:  Mukendi\'s view on UDPS-RCD relations 
contradicts what senior RCD figures have said recently, that 
the old alliance is very much alive and well.  In UDPS eyes, 
that partnership died in 2003 after the ex-belligerents 
failed to uphold an unwritten \"gentleman\'s agreement,\" 
whereby Tshisekedi would become vice-president in the 
transitional government.  The MLC is a much more attractive 
partner in terms of winning votes, and if he thought he could 
win, Jean-Pierre Bemba could probably accept being prime 
minister under a Tshisekedi presidency.  An alliance with 
President Joseph Kabila is a more awkward fit, because the 
age difference is more pronounced (Tshisekedi is 70-plus, 
Kabila is in his early 30s) and both would want to be 
president.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: CONTINUED CONFUSION ON DIAMOND SECTOR MANAGEMENT 
 
 
Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.4 b/d 
 
1. (C) Summary: Competition between the Minister of Mines 
Eugene Diomi Ndongala and CEEC (diamond evaluating authority) 
Managing Director Victor Kasongo continues to increase. The 
European Commission (EC) recently decided not to fund a 
diamond sector audit presented by Diomi and the IMF. The two 
major industrial diamond producers and the CEEC were included 
in the terms of reference. The Minister is also complicating 
the GDRC delegation to the Kimberley Process Plenary in 
Ottawa by attending himself with two advisors, separately 
from the original delegation led by Kasongo and three of his 
advisors. Coordination is non-existent between the two bodies 
and will frustrate reforms. End summary. 
 
2. (C) In concert with the IMF, Minister of Mines Diomi 
Ndongala approached the EC with terms of reference for a 
diamond sector audit to be conducted outside of the context 
of both the Kimberley Process and normal audits of 
parastatals. The terms of reference specifically targeted 
Sengamines (a privately-owned industrial level diamond 
producer), Miba (the diamond parastatal), and the CEEC (the 
diamond evaluating authority and a parastatal), all of which 
are significant revenue earning companies. (Comment: The 
Ministry of Mines has no jurisdiction to hold a financial 
audit of these firms and only has technical oversight of 
mining parastatals. Administrative and financial oversight 
rest with the Ministry of Portfolio. Diomi was, yet again, 
attempting to overstep the bounds of his authority, this time 
with the support of the IMF. End comment.) 
 
3. (SBU) EC representative Vincent Ringenberg reported to 
Econoff that the EC has decided not to fund the audit. 
Although the EC is interested in providing aid targeted 
toward the natural resources sector, it feels an ad hoc audit 
of three companies in the diamond sector is too specific (and 
politically sensitive) to have as a starting point. Before 
accepting projects in this sector, the EC would want to 
commission an expert study to identify what kind of 
value-added EC funded projects could have for the development 
of the DRC. The EC representative office has not yet informed 
the Ministry of Mines or the IMF. 
 
4. (C) The Kimberley Process considers the CEEC to be the 
main Congolese interlocutor for diamond evaluation and 
certification in the DRC. The CEEC is sending a delegation of 
four CEEC officials to Kimberley Process Plenary in Ottawa. 
When the Minister Diomi discovered that there was a plenary 
meeting and that the CEEC was already prepared to send a 
delegation and make a presentation, he immediately informed 
the Kimberley Process that he would attend himself with two 
accompanying advisors, effectively creating a parallel 
delegation. Canadian pol/econ counselor Stephen Randall 
commented that Kimberley Process Chair Tim Martin has allowed 
Victor Kasongo to remove the DRC from the list of presenters. 
Martin prefers not to officially deal with either group until 
Diomi and Kasongo sort out their differences. (Comment: The 
current Kimberley Process Plenary delegation snafu is 
unfortunate as it puts a very unprofessional face on the DRC 
shortly after the clear positive of voluntarily inviting the 
Kimberley Process to review DRC operations. End comment.) 
 
5. (C) Comment: Post feels the EC and the Kimberley Process 
are correct in avoiding official entanglements with the 
Ministry of Mines as any involvement is likely to be 
politicized by the Minister. If institutional battles between 
the Minister of Mines, the CEEC and other mining sector 
agencies continues, reforms as recommended by the World Bank 
and the recent Kimberley Process Review Visit will only come 
to fruition very difficulty and contentiously. IMF 
involvement is curious and is most likely tied to its 
objective of increasing government receipts. The IMF, 
however, has been shanghaied this time into supporting 
Diomi\'s personal agenda. End comment.

MEETING 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. National coordinators for the Great Lakes 
Conference (GLC) held their second preparatory meeting in 
Kinshasa from October 19-23. The core group of seven members 
was enlarged to eleven with the addition of Sudan, the 
Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, and Angola. 
President Kabila addressed the meeting to convey full DRC 
support for the GLC process. Participants adopted a tentative 
statement of principles for the Dar-es-Salam summit scheduled 
for November 19-20. End Summary. 
 
Kinshasa Hosts Regional Preparatory Meeting 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Kinshasa hosted the second meeting of national 
coordinators for the Great Lakes Conference (GLC) from 
October 19 to the 23rd. The GLC will meet in Dar-es-Salam on 
November 19 and 20th, and it will address four main areas; 
peace and security, good governance and democracy, economic 
development and regional integration, and humanitarian and 
social issues. This conference is being coordinated by the UN 
SRSG for the Great Lakes Region Ibrahima Fall, with support 
from the European Union and the African Union and financing 
from the Netherlands and Canada. 
 
3. (U) The Kinshasa meeting included representatives from the 
original seven core members (Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, 
Burundi, Uganda, Zambia, and the DRC) and the new four 
members (Sudan, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, 
and Angola) who will enjoy the same status as the original 
members. President Kabila gave a speech on the opening day of 
the meeting which signaled the DRC\'s full commitment to the 
GLC. SRSG Fall and DRC national Coordinator, Baudouin Hamuli, 
led the meetings and working sessions. 
 
4. (SBU) Congolese sources present at the Kinshasa meeting 
expressed satisfaction with the results, which included a 
preliminary declaration of principles to be signed by the 
heads of state at Dar-es-Salam. Participating members also 
presented their tentative agendas, which they will continue 
to refine during their next meeting of national coordinators 
scheduled for November 8-10 in Kampala. According to these 
sources, an important development was improved relations 
between the Rwandan and the DRC delegations. They noted that 
the U.S. sponsored tripartite talks among Rwanda, Uganda, and 
the DRC had also helped build confidence and had been 
specifically mentioned at the meeting as a positive 
initiative that the GLC process would support. 
 
GLC: A Process Rather than an Event 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Hamuli told poloff October 26 that participants 
envisioned the GLC as a process that had already started, 
rather than as a one-time event in Dar es Salaam. In his 
view, the coordinating meetings in Bujumbura and Kinshasa had 
lessened regional tensions improved communication among the 
members, and served as confidence-building forums for the 
eventual summits. He noted that the Dar-es-Salam conference 
will adopt principles, which national commissions will then 
try to implement with concrete measures during the ensuing 
six months. Another summit of heads of state will then take 
place in June 2005. 
 
6. (SBU) Hamuli said President Kabila will attend the 
Dar-es-Salam summit along with heads of state of all other 10 
members. UN Secretary General Kofi Anan, Nigerian President 
Olusegun Obasanjo, and high level delegations from the 
European Union, the African Union, the World Bank, the 
African Development Bank, Canada and The Netherlands are also 
expected to attend the GLC summit. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) The Kinshasa preparatory meeting for the GLC 
provided an opportunity to the DRC to play a more prominent 
role in this regional initiative. Kabila\'s participation also 
signaled a stronger DRC commitment to this process -- a 
change from prior ambivalence about the GLC, motivated by 
suspicion over Rwanda\'s intentions. To the extent that the 
Kinshasa meeting and the overall GLC process help build 
regional confidence and improved communication channels, they 
can be seen as a positive steps. Nonetheless, the broad 
agenda and enlarged membership will make it more difficult 
for the GLC to achieve concrete results. Moreover, it remains 
to be seen whether national commissions will be able to turn 
general principles on peace and security, economic 
development and regional integration, democracy and good 
governance, and humanitarian and social issues into practical 
regional initiatives. End Comment.

SUBJECT: UNHCR BEGINS REPATRIATION OF CONGOLESE FROM CAR 
 
REF: KINSHASA 1845 
 
1. (U) Summary. UNHCR began repatriation of Congolese 
refugees to Libenge, Equateur Province, with a ceremony on 
October 20th. The refugee agency expects to repatriate 
approximately 10,000 people to Equateur by the end of 2004. 
Minister of Interior Theophile Mbemba headed a GDRC 
delegation to the Libenge ceremony during which he stated the 
government\'s intention to welcome and assist the refugees. 
End Summary. 
 
UNHCR Starts Repatriation to Stable Area of DRC 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (U) UNHCR officials held a ceremony in Libenge, Equateur 
Province, October 20 to launch the repatriation of Congolese 
refugees from the Central African Republic (CAR) back to 
Equateur Province. The tripartite agreement which the DRC and 
CAR signed on August 26, 2004 has allowed UNHCR to start the 
repatriation process. UNHCR expects to assist approximately 
10,000 refugees to return from CAR to Equateur, over 1,000 of 
whom will be returning to Libenge. UNHCR\'s goal is to 
repatriate all of these refugees by the end of the year. 
 
3. (U) UNHCR opened an office in Libenge to assist returning 
Congolese refugees with humanitarian needs. A group of about 
50 refugees who arrived in Libenge in time for the ceremony 
received blankets, cooking utensils, and food from UN staff. 
Representatives of UNICEF, UNDP and WFP were also present in 
Libenge to coordinate refugee assistance. 
 
4. (SBU) According to UNHCR officials, it is important to 
start repatriation of refugees to Equateur Province, an area 
of the DRC which has enjoyed greater stability than the east. 
Although Equateur has a poor infrastructure and a difficult 
humanitarian situation, security for civilians has improved 
significantly with the departure a substantial number of 
Congo Liberation Movement\'s (MLC) troops to the east 
(reftel). 
 
GDRC Minister of Interior Received Warmly 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Interior Minister Theophile Mbemba Fundu headed a GDRC 
delegation which included provincial officials.  Mbemba was 
received warmly in Libenge, an isolated border town without 
electricity. The airport runway where the delegation landed 
was in fact only cleared of vegetation a few days before. 
(Note: Mbemba was the senior GDRC official to visit the area 
in many years. End Note.) In a speech to the Libenge 
community, Mbemba promised that the government would welcome 
returning refugees and help them reintegrate into their 
communities. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) Despite the fact that Libenge and other areas of 
Northern Equateur face a difficult humanitarian situation, 
UNHCR\'s decision to begin repatriation of refugees is 
consistent with its mandate of assisting refugees to return 
to areas where their physical integrity will not be at risk. 
In addition, socio-economic conditions in this part of the 
DRC are probably no worse than those on the CAR side. The 
security situation in Equateur is stable and there is no 
evidence of any armed groups operating in the province, and 
civilians can travel and engage in agricultural activities 
without significant problems. UNHCR and other UN agencies and 
NGOs can ameliorate hardship conditions by coordinating 
humanitarian assistance to refugees and local communities in 
areas of return like Libenge.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT KABILA\'S TRIUMPHAL VISIT TO KISANGANI 
 
Classified By: Poloff Meghan Moore for Reasons 1.4 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary: Thousands of residents warmly greeted 
President Kabila during his long-anticpated first visit to 
formerly-rebel-held territory since becoming President in 
2001. His October 16-18 trip to Kisangani was widely seen as 
a tangible sign of the country\'s reunification and the 
kick-off for next year\'s presidential campaign. Although the 
president\'s guards treated former RCD/G soldiers and 
policeman poorly, and the Presidency refused to accredit 
local journalists, the trip, on the whole, was positive. End 
Summary. 
 
Kabila Well-Received 
-------------------- 
 
2.(C) While in Kisangani, the President made a number of 
speeches, met with business, civil service and religious 
leaders, attended a special church service, and laid 
foundation stones for a medical clinic and the central 
market. Attending the presidential events were a number of 
ambassadors (including the French Ambassador), foreign and 
Kinshasa-based press (local journalists could not get 
accredited), and members of the PPRD. Thanking Kisangani 
residents for resisting occupation during the war, he said 
his visit was a strong sign of reunification, that peace and 
reconciliation have become realities, and elections must take 
place. During his visit, he surprised his guards and others 
by walking through the central market without a flak jacket, 
according to Kinshasa-based press. A local human rights 
leader told poloff that Kabila, who stayed in a tent in the 
neighborhood most affected during the war, presented himself 
as a man of the people and was very well-received by the 
local population. He said many saw Kabila\'s visit as a launch 
of his presidential campaign, complete with campaign 
speeches, PPRD operatives who arrived early with envelopes 
full of cash to mobilize people, and the payment of certain 
civil servants after Kabila left. 
 
Mistrust Continues 
------------------ 
 
3.(C) Hundreds of heavily-armed presidential guards (GSSP) 
were on hand to provide security for the President. During 
the week prior to his arrival, they sent former RCD/G 
soldiers as far away as Lubutu (about 150km), disarmed local 
policeman who were cantoned outside city limits, searched 
residences of the governor, vice governors, and ex-RCD/G 
brigade commanders and deputy military regional commanders 
(whose bodyguards were taken away). A local human rights 
leader said that the GSSP blocked roads, cordoned off 
neighborhoods, and arrested a number of people. On October 
25, RCD/G Parliamentary Group Leader Moise Nyragabo 
complained to Ambassador and poloff that ex-RCD/G soldiers, 
including the deputy military regional commander and brigade 
commanders, were kicked out of Kisangani prior to the 
President\'s visit. Soldiers loyal to 9th Military Regional 
Commander General Padiri were allowed to stay. USAID staff 
and a local human rights leader said they fear the GSSP\'s 
treatment of ex-RCD/G soldiers, and the GSSP\'s complete 
military control of the city could exacerbate existing 
tensions. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
4.(C) Kabila\'s first visit to former rebel-held territory was 
widely seen as a success. The presidential pre-campaign has 
clearly started, with political opposition VP Z\'Ahidi Ngoma 
visiting Bukavu during the same weekend (which reportedly 
annoyed Kabila), and MLC VP Bemba visiting Bukavu immediately 
after. Kabila\'s warm reception in Kisangani may encourage him 
to visit other eastern districts and towns, including Ituri 
and Kindu. Although the GSSP treated former RCD/G soldiers 
and policeman poorly, and the Presidency refused to accredit 
local journalists, the trip, especially in terms of electoral 
politics, was very positive for Kabila.

SUBJECT: PUTTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN 
THE DRC 
 
1. (U) Summary: Amnesty International\'s October report, \'DRC: 
Mass Rape- Time for Remedies\' provides a generally accurate 
picture of the nature of sexual violence in eastern DRC. Its 
suggestion that the international community has ignored this 
crisis, however, is untrue. The USG, for example, already has 
assisted over 10,000 victims and dedicated over $5.8 million 
dollars to help combat gender-based violence.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) On October 26, Amnesty International released a large, 
detailed report on sexual violence in the DRC with documented 
cases. \'DRC: Mass Rape- Time for Remedies\' calls on the GDRC 
and the international community to facilitate access to 
medical care for rape survivors, ensure that rehabilitating 
the health care system and improving security in the eastern 
provinces are priorities, take measures to prevent survivors 
from being subjected to social and economic exclusion, and 
facilitate survivors\' search for justice. Although the 
summary\'s tone suggested that medical concerns of rape 
victims have been sidelined, other sections of the report 
highlight the abysmal state of the Congo\'s medical 
infrastructure. 
 
3. (U) The report\'s description of the problem appears 
generally accurate. Its suggestion that the international 
community has ignored this crisis, however, is untrue. A 
number of donors, including the USG, have been working 
actively to combat this very serious issue since 2001. 
 
USG Efforts 
----------- 
 
4. (U) USAID addresses immediate and longer-term needs of 
survivors of sexual violence, their families, and their 
communities in areas of eastern Congo that have been most 
affected by armed conflict. In January 2004, USAID conducted 
an assessment mission, published an extensive report entitled 
\'Sexual Terrorism: Rape as a Weapon of War in Eastern DRC,\' 
and developed a broad gender-based violence strategy. USAID 
provides funding to experienced international organizations 
which work with local NGOs, health structures, and community 
based organizations to increase their capacity to provide 
holistic support to survivors including medical, 
psychosocial, protection, and socio-economic reintegration 
services, while promoting judicial support and referral when 
appropriate. 
 
5. (U) For instance, with 2002-2004 funding from Victims of 
Torture and TIP ($1,788,688 and $470,000 respectively) 12 
local organizations, which are mostly headed by survivors, 
received about $650,000 in sub-grants. The rest of the 
funding provided logistical support, materials in kind, 
medicines, training, workshops, information dissemination, 
coordination and referral to other services.  Since 2002 
these activities, which include post-rape reconstructive 
surgery at Panzi Hospital, mobile clinics which respond 
quickly to reported incidents of rape, and the first 
successful prosecution of a rape case in eastern DRC have 
assisted over 10,000 survivors, their families, and their 
communities. 
 
Looking Ahead 
-------------- 
 
6. (U) For FY04-FY06, USAID/DRC received $2,500,000 from the 
Victims of Torture Fund to support around 20 local 
organizations and health structures through international 
NGOs and $1,000,000 in OFDA funds to provide health services 
and training through UNICEF and an international NGO. In 
addition, USAID\'s Office of Transition Initiatives provides 
grants to local community-based organizations that also 
directly benefit victims. The total USAID budget specifically 
for gender-based violence from June 2002- September 2006 is 
$5,758,688. 
 
7. (U) In the past two years, the Embassy also used its 
limited Democracy and Human Rights Funds to support seven 
local organizations that promote women\'s rights and support 
survivors of sexual violence, including Centre Olame in 
Bukavu. In addition, the Embassy was awarded a special 
$50,000 grant in FY2004 to provide sexual violence survivors 
with access to judicial support services. As access continues 
to improve, and with continued USG funding, we are 
well-positioned to provide additional much-needed assistance 
for the victims of violence in eastern Congo. 
 
Other Efforts 
------------- 
 
8. (SBU) The European Union, the European Commission, and 
European bilateral donors, notably the Belgians and the 
Swiss, have also provided significant resources. A late 2003 
$30 million joint initiative by UN agencies to stop sexual 
violence in the DRC was well-received, but donors agreed the 
plan needs some revision. When revised, the plan could 
provide additional funding to address gender-based violence 
in the Congo. In addition, UN agencies and MONUC have 
prepared several reports on various aspects of this 
wide-scale problem, and MONUC plays an important role 
facilitating access for various NGOs. Post understands that a 
number of international organizations working on gender-based 
violence in the DRC are extremely disappointed that AI 
researchers did not contact them to discuss their existing 
and planned programs. 
 
9. (U)  Although the Congolese government has condemned 
gender-based violence at the highest levels, it has not taken 
much concrete action at this stage. The Justice, Social 
Affairs and Women\'s Affairs ministries have tried to develop 
limited programming to combat gender-based violence, but lack 
funding, capacity, and expertise. Unfortunately, 
well-intentioned activities often do not ensure 
confidentiality or protect survivors of violence, 
 
SIPDIS 
particularly in a culture in which, historically, women are 
considered second-class citizens. In addition, security 
concerns, poor medical infrastructure, limited resources (the 
budget for a country the size of the USA east of the 
Mississippi river is only $450 million), and lack of roads 
contribute to the Congolese government\'s inability to 
effectively deal with this problem. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) We are pleased that this report has focused 
high-level international attention on gender-based violence 
in the DRC. We note, for example, that the producers of the 
Oprah Winfrey Show are considering doing a program this month 
in Bukavu focusing on this issue. We hope that international 
media interest can be harnessed to help further the work 
being done by the USG, other donors, and local and 
international NGOs which have been working on this issue for 
a number of years.

2. (SBU) Embassy Kinshasa has reviewed the application that 
No.1 Contracting and Franoza Trucking have submitted to OPIC 
for political risk investment insurance on a performance 
bond. Post believes that there are no current political or 
economic difficulties associated with either the company or 
the project. No.1 Contracting will be providing construction 
services for two World Bank funded infrastructure repair and 
development projects. Funding is guaranteed. DRC treatment of 
foreign contractors varies, however, the bid and contracting 
process for such projects is carried out according to World 
Bank norms. Once commencing the project, the contractor will 
likely encounter some bureaucratic delays possibly related to 
licensing and authorization, taxes, and/or relationships with 
local officials. Logistical difficulties (e.g. consistent 
supply of gasoline, cement, etc.) will further complicate 
project success. 
 
3. (SBU) The following responds to specific questions in 
OPIC\'s memo to Post: 
 
a. Post does not foresee any negative public or host 
government sentiment toward the projects. 
 
b. The projects are unlikely to have negative impacts on U.S. 
policy and interests in the DRC. 
 
c. Post has no knowledge of accusations of improprieties on 
the part of No.1 Contracting. 
 
d. Post does not believe that the projects could potentially 
result in serious adverse environmental effects beyond those 
normally encountered in heavy construction projects. 
 
e. These projects fall under the World Bank\'s Emergency 
Multisectoral Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Plan. Hence, 
they are not in conflict with the DRC\'s economic objectives 
and welfare. 
 
f. Post is unaware of potential uneconomic use of raw 
materials or labor. 
 
g. These projects will not have an adverse affect on the 
DRC\'s balance of payments. The whole of funding is provided 
by the World Bank.

SUBJECT: MINISTER OF INTERIOR ON ELECTIONS, SECURITY 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.4 b/d. 
 
 1. (C)  Summary:  Minister of Interior, and PPRD co-founder, 
Theofile Mbemba expressed concern that the newly launched 
pre-election campaigns will further divide the transitional 
components and throw up new obstacles to military 
integration.  He outlined a PPRD strategy to dominate all the 
southern provinces except western Kasai, as well as South 
Kivu and Katanga in the East, thereby ensuring Joseph 
Kabila\'s victory.  The majority of seats in Parliament likely 
will go to the MLC, according to the Minister, making Bemba 
Prime Minister.  Mbemba insisted that Kabila has decided to 
be the PPRD candidate but will postpone announcing this until 
early December. The PPRD is exploring alliances with the MLC 
and Etienne Tshisekedi\'s UDPS with an eye to improving the 
PPRD position in Province Orientale and western Kasai, 
respectively.  When pressed, he admitted that Katanga could 
be not only an electoral battleground but the stumbling block 
for the transition as a whole. With face-offs between police 
and military on the rise and social tension increasing, 
Mbemba said, the country could \"implode\" before elections in 
any event.  End Summary. 
 
The PPRD Elections Map -- Color It PPRD 
 
2. (C)  Over dinner October 29 at PolCoun\'s house, Minister 
of Interior and PPRD co-founder Theofile Mbemba waxed 
enthusiastic over his party\'s likely success in next year\'s 
elections.  Simply put, party strategists believe the PPRD 
will control Kinshasa (itself a province), Bas-Congo, 
Bandundu and East Kasai, as well as South Kivu and Katanga. 
West Kasai is solidly with Etienne Tshisekedi\'s UDPS so 
unless PPRD can forge an alliance they will not do well there 
-- and do not intend to waste time, money or effort in trying 
to do so.  The Eastern Province probably will go to 
Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s MLC, according to Mbemba, but 
surprisingly, Bemba could lose his home province of Equateur 
to either the UDPS (which, according to Mbemba, is well 
organized and working hard there) or to the PPRD.  The RCD is 
too weak to control anything, and therefore the entire East 
is up for grabs -- which, he said, explains why everyone has 
launched their campaigns in Bukavu (or, in the President\'s 
case, Kisangani).  A clearly disgruntled Mbemba acknowledged 
that President Kabila will now be the last politician to 
visit South Kivu, since Bemba, VP Z\'Ahidi Ngoma and now VP 
Yarodia have all made initial visits.  Nonetheless, Mbemba 
was confident that Kabila will capture South Kivu, in part 
because of his mother\'s origins.  (Note:  Presidential 
friends and loyalists say that Kabila\'s mother is a South 
Kivutian -- his enemies say that she is a Rwandan.  In any 
event, she likely is from South Kivu, at least 
geographically. End Note.)  North Kivu will be an enigma 
until the day after elections, Mbemba predicted, but 
acknowledged that Bemba clearly is courting Governor 
Serufuli, who is unquestionably well-positioned to \"deliver\" 
his province to the candidate of his choice.  (Septel reports 
further details of Bemba\'s visit to the two Kivus.)  Even 
without North Kivu, however, Mbemba said Kabila will garner 
the majority of the popular vote, guaranteeing his election 
as president. 
 
Useful But Not Necessary Alliances 
 
3. (C)  Mbemba said that the PPRD is exploring a possible 
alliance with the MLC, primarily with the aim of improving 
its effective presence in Parliament, i.e., the MLC likely 
will win a majority of Parliamentary seats, putting it in a 
position to block key government legislation.  Bemba likely 
would \"settle\" for being Prime Minister, a position which 
would ensure his continued access to wealth, and he and 
Kabila normally have a good working relationship, Mbemba 
said, making this a natural partnership.  (Note:  Mbemba said 
that both PPRD and MLC have already decided to support a 
President-Prime Minister-Parliament scheme for the future 
government, implying there is therefore little left to do but 
produce the appropriate paragraphs in the consitution 
enshrining this arrangement.  End Note.)  PPRD also is 
talking to Tshisekedi\'s UDPS but so far the negotiations 
haven\'t advanced much beyond the early stages, in large part 
because PPRD has more to offer UDPS than vice versa -- 
although PPRD would, Mbemba admitted, like to add West Kasai 
to its group of \"captive\" provinces.  (Comment:  It could be 
hard for the elder statesman Tshisekedi to swallow being 
second fiddle to a young upstart like Kabila.  End Comment.) 
Mbemba insisted that UDPS will not renew its old ties to the 
RCD (despite recent confident assertions PolCouns heard from 
RCD leaders), since the RCD \"has nothing to offer anyone.\" 
When PolCouns asked about courting Z\'Ahidi Ngoma or Yarodia 
(for the support of the unarmed political opposition and 
civil society, respectively) Mbemba somewhat contemptuously 
dismissed both, noting that neither faction is united nor 
does either benefit from strong leadership -- meaning that 
all the diverse elements are up for grabs.  (Comment:  Given 
the historical animosity between Yarodia and Kabila it would 
be hard in any event to image Yarodia throwing his support 
behind Kabila, even were he in a position to do so.  End 
Comment.)  He added, almost in passing, that President Kabila 
is currently \"on the outs\" with Z\'Ahidi over the latter\'s 
visit to Bukavu the same weekend as the President\'s trip to 
Kisangani -- a move clearly designed to upstage the President 
in one of his \"home provinces.\"  After a quick pause, Mbemba 
said that of the major religious groups (a key element of 
civil society) the Kimbanguists definitely will support 
Kabila, and possibly the Catholics as well, but that the 
evangalists probably will go for Tshisekedi while the 
protestants will throw their support to Bemba. 
 
Katanga The Battleground, Maybe In More Ways Than One 
 
4. (C)  When pressed, Mbemba reluctantly acknowledged that 
PPRD might have trouble in Katanga -- in more ways than one. 
From both an electoral and security standpoint, he said, the 
province is increasingly problematic and indeed, could be the 
trigger which explodes the transition.  Pointing to outside 
influence, Mbemba said that Congolese security forces have, 
in the last several weeks, \"escorted\" over thirty Zambians to 
the border and warned them not to return.  These were people, 
he said, who have been posing as businessmen but who actually 
have been fomenting unrest and political divisiveness; 
likewise Tanzania is increasingly active in the province, 
particularly in the northern zones, and its influence is 
becoming worrisome, while South Africa is a \"giant\" in the 
provincial landscape.  All this plus, he noted, a resurgence 
of traditional tribal-based tensions between north-south 
Katanga and between southern Katanga and West Kasai, 
represents a heady and potentially explosive brew.  Finally, 
he noted cautiously, there are some Presidential advisors, 
Katangans, who don\'t necessarily want elections and who have 
been working against the President\'s interests in the 
province.  (Comment:  Mbemba wouldn\'t name names, but most 
likely he was referring to both Air Force General Numbi and 
Augustin Katumba, whose name increasingly is being linked to 
a variety of troubling developments.  PolCouns also has heard 
from various people that Katumba is trying to marginalize 
Mbemba or drive him from office, because he, Katumba, would 
like Mbemba\'s job, so there also could be an element of 
personal bias involved in Mbemba\'s hints.  End Comment.) 
 
Finger On The Trigger - Social Unrest Rising 
 
5. (C)  During dinner Mbemba took several calls (including 
one from Kabila) about a security incident in the Kinshasa 
neighborhood of Binza, where unpaid soldiers had tried to rob 
moneychangers, only to be attacked by enraged citizens, 
assisted by police.  Using this incident as an example, 
Mbemba said that he is increasingly concerned that face-offs 
between military and police, or between citizens and 
army/police, represent a disturbing societal shift.  People 
are angry and restless, he said, and more and more they are 
inclined to fight back, sometimes striking out without 
thinking.  This \"social trigger,\" he said, could implode the 
country before the transition can get to elections.  Along 
these lines, he added that he regrets the early launch of 
pre-campaigning, which he feels will further divide the 
transition and virtually eliminate the possibility of 
military integration (he predicted that the RCD, especially, 
will now dig in its heels on integration since its only 
political card is the threat of renewed fighting in the 
East).  He welcomed the latest EU initiative to provide 
police training, hoping that it will augment, in some ways, 
the French-trained riot police.  (Comment:  When Mbemba left 
he was on his way to Binza, together with a military 
official, to try to calm the situation without utilizing the 
riot police against the military, and indeed, the situation 
was resolved without recourse to violent means. End Comment.) 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C)  We agree that social issues and/or the swirling 
dynamic of Katanga are two potential flashpoints to future 
progress, but it is unclear what the government, or Kabila 
specifically, can do to defuse them. The former is difficult 
due to lack of means, the latter intransigent because of 
Kabila\'s reliance on Katangans as a key support base. 
Mbemba\'s vision of PPRD dominance and MLC quiessence seems 
simplistic and, indeed, cocky, although we could wish it 
would indeed be this easy. More troubling are his admissions 
-- confirming our suspicions -- of possible external 
manipulation in Katanga.

SUBJECT: THE CONGOLESE TRANSITION CURRENT AND FUTURE, AND 
THE U.S. ROLE 
 
 
Classified By: Roger Meece.  Reason 1.4 (b/d) 
 
1. (C) Summary:  There has been major progress in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo over the past few years, 
ending years of open warfare involving eight national armies 
and numerous domestic armed groups.  Peace accords have 
yielded the formal withdrawal of foreign troops, a domestic 
transition process leading to elections, and an unprecedented 
level in central Africa of international community 
involvement, including a major U.N. peacekeeping operation. 
The current peace is tenuous, however, and the transition 
structure is ungainly and fragile, liable to the risk of 
collapse from numerous internal and regional threats.  As 
well, any strategy to achieve long-term stability in the 
country must take into account the de facto lack of a unified 
coherent government in Kinshasa.  Our overriding policy 
priorities must be the success of the DRC transition process, 
and cessation of destabilizing inter-state activities.  There 
are four main areas for attention: 1) the security 
environment, 2) preparation and conduct of elections, 3) 
establishment of government authority across the country, and 
4) regional relations.  Success is by no means guaranteed; 
however, the U.S. has an important role to play to ensure 
positive outcomes in each of these areas.  This cable 
describes background developments leading to the current 
situation, summarizes the existing strategic framework and 
future plan, and outlines priority areas for USG support or 
intervention.  End summary. 
 
Background and Context 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) Following decades of bad governance under the Mobutu 
dictatorship and an inconclusive &sovereign national 
conference,8 central government in then-Zaire had become 
largely irrelevant for the vast majority of its citizens by 
the mid-90\'s.  Despite immense natural resources, overall 
conditions had degraded to the point where one could no 
longer meaningfully speak of national infrastructure, GDP 
experienced a long-term decline, and a political vacuum had 
developed.  In essence, the country had no functional 
national government, with all the attendant negative economic 
and social consequences to be expected from that central 
reality.  The 1994 genocide and war in neighboring Rwanda 
generated enormous waves of primarily Hutu Rwandan citizens 
crossing the Zaire border, including ex-Kigali government 
extremists implicated in the genocide as well as civilian 
refugees.  Rather than seeking to address positively the 
growing eastern crisis, various Zairian leaders continued 
free-wheeling profit-oriented practices, dealing with and 
supporting the Rwandan extremist Hutu leaders. 
 
3. (C) Unfortunately, the international community also failed 
to take any meaningful action to bring under control the 
armed extremist elements that continued to operate in the 
vast camps established in eastern Zaire.  After two years, 
the Kigali government had had enough with what it viewed as 
an unacceptable status quo and ongoing security threat 
emanating from the eastern Zaire camps.  In 1996 Rwandan 
forces, acting in concert with other nations, moved to break 
up the camps with invasion forces.  Whether intended or not, 
the action also brought about as a corollary the collapse of 
the precarious Zairian equilibrium.  With a broad alliance of 
African states eventually joining in against the 
widely-disliked Mobutu, the Kinshasa government fell within 
months.  It was replaced by a government composed largely of 
Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed figures, with Laurent Kabila 
installed as President by mid-1997.  The new government in 
essence basically threw out all remaining vestiges of the 
Mobutu regime, readopted the name of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, and began to build new government institutions 
from scratch. 
 
4. (C)  The Laurent Kabila government, however, proved itself 
also incapable of competent performance.  Perhaps inevitably, 
it increasingly chafed under continuing Rwandan influence, 
leading to growing tensions with its erstwhile patron. 
Eventually this led to renewed warfare in August 1998, and 
new invasions by Rwandan and Ugandan armies. Unlike 1996, 
however, other African states moved to support Kinshasa, 
eventually creating an alliance of Zimbabwean, Angolan, 
Namibian, and Chadian forces working with the Kabila 
government arrayed against Rwandan, Ugandan, and Burundian 
armies aligned with various Congolese rebel clients.  Mixed 
into this picture was an overlay of Hutu/Tutsi conflicts, 
with Kinshasa embracing active support of Rwandan Hutu 
extremists (e.g., ex-FAR, Interahamwe) in the war, and the 
continuing conflict reinforcing an already-widely prevalent 
anti-Tutsi sentiment in much of the DRC. 
 
5. (C) A military stalemate developed in 1998/1999, resulting 
in de facto separation of DRC territorial administration, 
largely divided between the Kinshasa government backed by its 
southern Africa allies; a Ugandan-sponsored group, the 
Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) in the north; and a 
Rwandan-backed group, the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) 
controlling much of the east.  Foreign sponsors participated 
heavily in exploitation of Congo,s rich mineral wealth in 
all three zones.  Inevitable tensions among the various 
Congolese groups and their foreign backers, among the 
Congolese themselves, and between supposed allies (e.g., 
Rwanda and Uganda) produced splinter movements and an overall 
proliferation of various armed groups and militias. 
 
6. (C) Efforts by the U.S. and others to find a peaceful 
solution were hindered by the necessity to seek means to 
address simultaneously the varied, and largely unrelated, 
interests of the numerous foreign states involved in the 
conflict, as well as to redress the continuing political 
vacuum in the Congo, including a complete lack of coherent 
national DRC political structures and constituencies.  As a 
result of enormous efforts and substantial international 
pressure, and with critically important active intervention 
by the U.S., the Lusaka Accord was achieved in 1999.  While 
the Lusaka Accord was not sufficient to bring an immediate 
halt to the conflict, it did provide the basis for an 
eventual formal withdrawal of foreign troops from DRC 
territory, and establishment of an &Inter-Congolese8 
dialogue as a way to establish an internal process toward 
national governance.  The latter dialogue, again with heavy 
international engagement, eventually resulted in a &Global 
and All-Inclusive Accord8 (the Sun City Accord) in 2003 
establishing the basis for the formal DRC transition process 
incorporating all former Congolese belligerents, as well as 
other internal &non-armed8 groups leading to elections. 
These two agreements comprise the foundation for the end to 
active hostilities and they set the stage for the current 
environment. 
 
DRC Transition: Ungainly, Burdened by Mistrust, But Yielding 
Results 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
7. (C)  Given the complexity of the domestic political 
environment, the required compromises among the varied 
Congolese groups and diverse foreign patrons, and the 
duration of active warfare, it is hardly surprising that the 
transition structures established by peace accords are 
ungainly and characterized by persistent deep mistrust among 
key officials and factions.  An additional impediment to 
transition success is residual suspicion between the 
&ex-government8 faction in Kinshasa, headed by President 
Joseph Kabila, and its perceived enemy neighbors on the 
eastern border, particularly Kampala and Kigali.  This is 
coupled with continuing links between the other former main 
Congolese belligerents and their respective foreign allies 
(the MLC and Uganda; the RCD-Goma and Rwanda).  In short, the 
Kinshasa transition government is not a coherent single 
entity, but rather more a collection of former adversaries 
existing in uneasy co-habitation.  It is essentially not 
capable of domestic or international long-term engagements 
routinely undertaken by established governments.    In 
addition, many in the DRC political class in all factions of 
the transition are not eager to see a successful electoral 
end to the transition, and it is likely that relatively few 
would find any popular base for electoral success. 
 
8. (C) Despite daunting challenges, the transition has been 
producing results, albeit at a slower pace than widely 
desired.  While many considered it highly unlikely three or 
four years ago, formal withdrawal of foreign national armies 
from DRC territory has been completed, ongoing combat has 
been stopped, and all major DRC political groups have been 
brought together into a transition government, however 
unwieldy that government may be.  Reversing decades of 
economic under-performance, important economic results have 
been achieved (e.g., stabilization of exchange rates, low 
inflation, three years of real GDP growth), and preparations 
for scheduled 2005 elections (including key pieces of 
legislation) have been moving forward.    Perhaps the most 
significant indicator of progress, political leaders of all 
major groups have increasingly been gauging their rhetoric 
and actions to what amounts to early electoral positioning, a 
reflection that the political leadership generally is 
increasingly thinking in terms of a political, and 
specifically electoral, process rather than renewed military 
operations.  Overall, the situation in most of the DRC stands 
in startlingly positive contrast to that existing a few years 
ago. 
 
Factors Supporting Progress 
--------------------------- 
 
9. (C) There are four major forces favoring transition 
progress.  First, there is general war-weariness among the 
large majority of Congolese, coupled with a continuing sense 
of national identity that broadly cuts across all factions. 
The war had largely stalemated with no major change in sight, 
and the de facto division of the country worked against both 
economic and political aspirations of most Congolese.  The 
transition process offers the only viable alternative. 
Secondly and related, there is a deeply-held desire by most 
Congolese for a durable peace.  This has crystallized into 
strong expectations for elections as the most visible symbol 
of the end to the transition - and the DRC,s long conflict. 
This represents a dramatic change from the stoic resignation 
characteristic of much of pre-war Zaire,s population, and 
represents a major and positive force to which political 
leaders are sensitive.  It also has a negative aspect, 
however, with a potentially explosive reaction should popular 
expectations not be satisfied.  Third, there is an 
unprecedented engagement in the DRC by the international 
community.  This is manifested in the 17-member International 
Committee To Accompany the Transition (CIAT), which is in 
fact a formal transition institution created by the 
underlying peace agreements.  The CIAT is widely credited as 
a beneficial and needed force to maintain progress.  Finally, 
the UN peacekeeping operation (MONUC), while far from 
perfect, brings a significant military force to help counter 
the influence of the many remaining armed groups and so 
provide at least a reasonable promise of needed adequate 
security conditions, and it has proved invaluable in numerous 
cases to keep the transition moving forward. 
 
But Major Threats Also Remain 
----------------------------- 
10. (C)  Progress to-date notwithstanding, there are 
innumerable ways for the transition process to derail, and 
even lead to a resumption of generalized warfare.  The 
continued existence of numerous armed groups, including 
formal armies, various armed militias, diverse localized Mai 
Mai factions and bands, and armed Rwandan Hutu extremists all 
create security threats and occasional flare-ups, especially 
in the volatile eastern regions.  The continuing severe 
weakness of central government institutions and the lack of 
any real government authority in many parts of the country 
leaves an on-going dangerous and destabilizing political void 
in the country.  In addition, the oft-displayed fecklessness 
of the Congolese political class always has the potential of 
producing gridlock, or worse.  Years of invasions, 
occupation, and conflict have left a degree of tension in the 
east between various communities, most notably the 
Kinyarwanda-speaking Congolese Tutsis and Hutus and other 
Congolese ethnic groups.  Finally, continuing influence and 
reports of active intervention (including military forces) in 
the eastern region by neighboring countries, particularly 
Rwanda and to a lesser extent Uganda, and enduring commercial 
interests also reinforce the threat of renewed instability 
which would undoubtedly affect all of the DRC. 
 
The Way Forward 
--------------- 
11. (C) The CIAT, GDRC leaders, and most observers concur 
that the desired end-state of the transition period is a 
legitimate Kinshasa government elected through free and fair 
elections; a sound political, economic, and social basis for 
durable stability throughout the country; and regional 
international relationships that at minimum provide for 
normal diplomatic relations and resolution of differences 
through dialogue.  The overriding priorities for the short- 
to medium-term must be the success of the DRC transition 
process, and the end to destabilizing interstate activities. 
The analysis above and the transition structure suggest that 
the strategy to achieve these ends needs to be focused on 
four critical areas: security, elections, state 
authority/development, and regional relations.  The following 
paragraphs provide brief summaries of each critical area 
designed to indicate current or planned activities, but are 
not comprehensive descriptions.  The first three largely 
domestic issues are reflected in transition &road maps,8 
one adopted by and utilized by the CIAT, and a similar 
document recently approved by the GDRC.  The road map outline 
serves as the base line strategic transition plan as 
discussed within the local community. 
 
a) The Security Environment 
This includes two major components. The first deals with the 
existing multiple armies and combatant groups, estimated to 
include as many as 300,000-plus men under arms.  A major 
demobilization (DDR) program has been designed with heavy 
World Bank involvement, intended to demobilize roughly 
200,000 combatants.  A specialized but urgent sub-component 
of this program is one dealing with the substantial number of 
child soldiers.  Substantial support has already been 
committed to this effort, including World Bank funds, as well 
as the involvement of USAID and other donors.  Specifically, 
USAID\'s support is focused on reintegration of ex-combatants 
back into communities.   A needed complement to this effort 
is to produce an integrated national Congolese army.  While 
the latter lags behind the DDR framework, conceptual and 
unfortunately competing frameworks for integration have been 
prepared by the Belgian and South African governments. 
Currently there are promising efforts underway in Kinshasa 
and respective capitals seeking to harmonize these plans and 
establish a master unified plan.  Financial resources have 
not yet been identified, although the Europeans in particular 
are implying in conversations that funds may be found at 
least to initiate the effort.   Armed local groups, including 
those in Ituri and potentially some Mai Mai groups, represent 
a related but separate issue, with solutions unlikely pending 
definition and establishment of the overall integration and 
DDR programs.  Finally, armed Rwandan Hutu extremists 
represent a distinct problem, with such groups creating 
security problems within the Kivus as well as representing a 
continuing threat to Rwandan security.  A MONUC-led voluntary 
disarmament and repatriation program (DDRRR) had shown 
promising results, repatriating to Rwanda many thousands of 
combatants and their dependents.  Numbers of new DDRRR 
enrollees dropped to near-zero, however, following the June 
takeover of Bukavu by &dissident8 RCD Tutsi generals Nkunda 
and Mutebusi.  Many of the remaining Hutu extremist elements, 
estimated to number between 8,000 - 15,000, may require 
forcible disarmament.  Prevailing current thinking among CIAT 
members is that this task should be undertaken by a specially 
selected and integrated FARDC &Kivu Brigade8 (pursuant to 
the integration plans discussed above), whose operations 
would be closely coordinated with MONUC-reinforced 
deployments and operations in the east.  Progress in all 
these areas must be realized, and be visible, prior to the 
holding of elections if the volatile eastern region is to 
participate in voting in a meaningful way .  Completion of 
the full integration/demobilization effort, however, will not 
be required prior to elections, and indeed may continue for 
some time into the future. 
 
b) Elections 
The centerpiece of the Sun City Accord is the holding of 
elections, targeted for June 2005.  The accord provides for 
up to two six-month extension periods as necessary. 
Significant delays, however, risk strong if not explosive 
negative public reaction.  Election preparations have 
proceeded laboriously, but at this point there is a general 
election plan in place, a budget reviewed and largely 
endorsed by the international community, and the start of 
needed legislation by the National Assembly and Senate.  An 
Independent Electoral Commission has been formed and is 
starting to operate, thanks in large measure to timely USAID 
intervention.  The election plan is based on as simple a 
model as possible, necessary given the limited time 
available, the size of the country (roughly the size of 
Western Europe), population (approximately 60 million), and 
utter lack of national infrastructure. For example, no census 
is planned, only a voter registration exercise. 
Approximately half of the calculated $285 million elections 
budget has been promised to-date by donors, primarily the EU. 
 Key decisions remain, including the question of the timing 
of local, provincial, and Presidential elections (e.g., 
simultaneous or sequential), and the form of balloting (e.g., 
single-round or runoff elections for President).  Strong 
international and domestic pressure is being maintained on 
political players to complete important legislation, 
including changes or approval of a new draft Constitution, 
which itself requires approval by referendum.  As noted 
above, however, political parties and leaders are already 
beginning what amounts to election campaign activity and 
there is no clear dominating political figure or party with a 
decisive national majority.  A crucial but often overlooked 
aspect to this issue is the immediate post-election period, 
with inevitable unhappiness and challenges by election 
losers, a critical concern in a region burdened by large 
numbers of weapons and combat-experienced fighters. 
Continued strong engagement and support by the international 
community, including MONUC within the limits of that body,s 
mandate, will be required for the successful conduct of 
elections, and transition through the post-election period. 
 
c) State Authority, and General Development 
As previously noted, a large part of the current problems in 
the DRC can be attributed to the political vacuum at the 
center - the lack of viable government institutions and 
operations to govern generally, much less to manage a large 
and diverse country such as the Congo.   This will require 
sustained effort over a long time, extending far beyond 
elections, essentially building a new structure from a base 
near zero.  There has already been significant progress, 
however, seen in areas as diverse as macro-economic indices 
(as cited above); the gradual establishment of minimal 
government services (e.g., police operations, schools), 
albeit in limited areas; and even the recent appointment of 
an Ituri District Commissioner, the first sign in years of 
Kinshasa government authority in that troubled district. 
Despite good gains in the government,s revenue base in the 
past two years, domestic-generated resources are still 
extremely limited with a current GDRC domestic revenue budget 
base of roughly $450 million dollars for an area equivalent 
to the U.S. east of the Mississippi.  Clearly, sustained and 
significant international support will be required for an 
extended period in this area.  As well, accompanying a 
gradual replacement of military operations by peacetime 
government, major reconciliation efforts are needed at the 
local grassroots level and some are needed at the national 
level, particularly in the volatile eastern areas.  Without 
the success of such reconciliation efforts, accompanied by 
activities bringing the promise of economic improvement, 
sustainable stability in the eastern region will be hard to 
achieve.  Related, the DRC,s largely dysfunctional judicial 
system requires rebuilding.  Finally, visible economic and 
social development progress must be seen for nascent 
government institutions to have credibility, and to address 
the urgent basic needs of Congolese citizens.  Macroeconomic 
achievements need to translate into new investment and 
employment, and improvements to the disastrous state of DRC 
basic education, health, and other services must be evidenced. 
 
d) Regional Relations 
Obviously stability in the DRC and indeed the region requires 
that regional governments refrain from unilateral 
cross-border military operations or other activities intended 
to undermine neighboring states.  The DRC is particularly 
vulnerable given the precarious and divided nature of its 
current transition government.  For long-term stability, 
however, we need to go further and work to build 
intergovernmental relations in which governments are capable 
of dealing with each other, and resolving conflicts through 
dialogue rather than confrontation.  Such is not currently 
the case, and the respective governments, especially those in 
Kigali and Kinshasa, are unlikely to normalize their 
relations if left to themselves.  There are numerous efforts 
to promote regional dialogue, including initiatives sponsored 
by the U.N., Belgium, South Africa, and other African states 
as well as the U.S.  A basis for improved relations exists in 
the form of commercial and economic potential, and a presumed 
shared interest in peace and stability.  Ultimately, however, 
deep-seated mistrust and personal animosity arising from 
years of conflict, exacerbated by events such as the recent 
massacre of Congolese refugees in a camp in Burundi, must be 
overcome by a realization that each country can best serve 
its own interests through peaceful dialogue.  At minimum, 
clear and consistent international pressure must be 
maintained, rejecting as unacceptable cross-border 
interference.  Ultimately, the countries in the region 
themselves must renounce ambitions to work against 
neighboring states, although realization of this goal is 
unlikely until a more durable and coherent government can be 
established in Kinshasa following elections.  More broadly, 
success in this area will require sustained international 
engagement to promote concrete cooperation measures (e.g., 
Uganda/DRC and Rwanda Joint Verification Mechanisms), improve 
border controls, and regularize ongoing contacts and dialogue. 
 
12. (C)  Progress in the inter-related four areas identified 
above will be self-reinforcing, i.e., progress in any area is 
helpful to efforts in the other three.  Conversely, at least 
some degree of success in all four areas is needed to achieve 
overall objectives.  A lack of progress in any of the four 
will necessarily retard overall progress, and the overall 
objective of a stable region requires at least partial 
forward movement in all four categories. 
 
Other Issues 
------------ 
 
13. (C) The sectors cited above do not constitute a 
comprehensive listing of important outstanding issues.  For 
example, improper exploitation of the DRC,s natural 
resources by foreign and Congolese interests continues as a 
major problem.  It is unlikely, however, that satisfactory 
resolution of this issue can be found prior to progress in 
establishing Kinshasa government authority and at least some 
improvement in working relations with neighboring countries. 
Likewise, sexual violence directed against women is a 
horrifying past and present reality, with some armed groups 
practicing systematic sexual predation as a weapon.  While 
there are numerous activities underway to address this 
problem, including significant USAID operations, definitive 
resolution is unlikely in the east absent progress in 
military demobilization and integration, as well as 
establishment of coherent DRC government authority. 
Impunity also remains a major problem requiring resolution, 
with a long-term answer certainly requiring at least minimal 
improvements in the DRC,s barely functioning legal system. 
All of these and other issues are important.  The four areas 
cited above, however, remain the central focus areas that 
will in turn permit progress to be realized to address a 
variety of other issues. 
 
The U.S. Role 
------------- 
 
A - Central Focus 
 
14. (C)  As indicated above, the central problem is the 
political void at the center, i.e., the lack of government 
institutions and authority in the DRC.  U.S. engagement 
therefore needs to be focused primarily on support for the 
transition process, its successful conclusion through the 
conduct of free and fair elections, and follow-through for a 
successful post-election period.  This activity needs to be 
complemented by continuing attention to ensure observance of 
non-interference across borders among the Great Lakes 
countries, and normalization of relations among all Great 
Lake states. 
 
B. - International Cooperation 
 
15. (C) The DRC is a huge country with accumulated immense 
problems.  Certainly no single country alone has the 
resources to assist in finding the necessary solutions. 
Instead, we must focus use of our available resources, 
coordinating closely with other bilateral and multilateral 
countries and agencies to achieve the desired results. 
Fortunately, widely shared common objectives and much of the 
framework to enable such cooperation already exist, a 
beneficial product of the work done in recent years to bring 
an end to the DRC conflict.  The principal national players 
involved are Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, South 
Africa, and Angola as well as the U.S.  All are heavily 
involved already with assistance and/or political support for 
the DRC,s transition.  These efforts are complemented by 
substantial involvement of the European Union, World Bank, 
IMF, ADF, and United Nations as multilateral partners. 
 
16. (C)  A general framework for coordination exists in the 
17 member CIAT, whose membership includes all the main 
bilateral engaged countries (e.g., Belgium, France, U.K., 
South Africa, Angola and U.S.) as well as the European Union, 
the African Union, and MONUC.  We should stay strongly 
engaged in CIAT activities to ensure a maximum degree of 
harmonized policies and activities.  Complementary 
senior-level consultations between capitals should ensure a 
close degree of coordination between discussions being 
conducted at the level of the CIAT, and topics being 
discussed during bilateral/multilateral consultations. 
 
17. (C)  The MONUC peacekeeping operation represents another 
element vital to the success of the transition process. 
MONUC has a unique capability to help ensure adequate 
security conditions in the DRC necessary for progress, and 
this should therefore be its central and overriding focus. 
MONUC, however, also has a variety of other capabilities and, 
in accordance with the existing UNSC resolution, 
responsibilities.  Within the constraints of available 
resources, the U.S. should continue to be as supportive as 
possible of the MONUC mission, while continuing to press to 
maintain a MONUC focus on key priorities to preclude mission 
creep, and enlargement of an already existing 
mission/resource gap. 
 
18. (C) Ongoing discussions being conducted in New York at 
the U.N., and in particular the Security Council, as well as 
Bank and Fund sessions also provide an opportunity for 
improved coordination with multilateral coordination through 
the CIAT.  To-date, internal USG coordination regarding these 
fora has been less than ideal, and efforts are needed to 
ensure better communication and coordination regarding 
proposed discussions, initiatives, and activities.  The U.S. 
has considerable influence in each of the multilateral 
bodies, and we need to do a better job to ensure that such 
influence is being used effectively in terms of our bilateral 
agenda, as well as being coordinated with our positions in 
the CIAT multilateral context. 
 
C - Bilateral Activities 
 
19. (C)  Within the general context of overall support for 
the transition process, current U.S. government programs and 
activities should be focused on four major areas: 1) 
governance issues, including election preparations, 2) 
military and security issues, 3) development and institution 
building, and 4) regional relations. 
 
-     Governance and elections:  The U.S., primarily through 
State and USAID activities, has been very much engaged in 
this area, and continued major involvement will be important 
to a range of governance issues.  In terms of elections, 
USAID was instrumental in quick intervention, for example to 
get the Independent Electoral Commission in operation.  It 
will be important for us to continue to be very active to 
encourage further progress and ensure acceptable procedures. 
Our support, however, is constrained by limited USAID 
Democracy and Government Funding.  Specifically, at this 
point, we have very little available or committed to direct 
election support, a dramatic contrast to the EU,s total 
committed to-date of over $100m. 
 
-     Military and security:  The U.S. has already committed 
resources to the DDR program, both through its support of the 
World Bank and in bilateral terms through USAID.  As 
previously noted, there are promising initiatives underway 
for harmonizing competing models from South Africa and 
Belgium of the equally critical military integration program. 
 Pending results of that effort, we should be prepared to 
look at $3.4 million in available leftover prior-year FMF 
funds for potential support to the integration and military 
reform program as may be appropriate.  We should also be 
attentive to child soldier demobilization activities, and 
general reintegration programs for additional intervention 
with any new resources made available. 
 
-     Development and institution building:  The U.S. is 
involved in these efforts, primarily through USAID.  This is 
a long-term process, however, and sustained engagement will 
be required to show satisfactory results both pre- and 
post-election to help create conditions conducive to 
long-term stability.  Lists of economic, education, and 
health needs are very long, and the government structures and 
policies needed to support progress are largely yet to be 
created.  One major area that is currently underfunded by all 
donors is national and regional reconciliation programs. 
Progress in achieving reconciliation, particularly in the 
troubled east, is essential for long-term peace in the DRC 
and the region.  We should be attentive to the possibility of 
any new resources that may be made available for these kinds 
of activities, as well as seek to tap into expertise in 
Africa or elsewhere that has proven effective to achieve 
results.  Clearly, general development activities should also 
be identified for target regions that could complement any 
reconciliation programs that are implemented. 
 
-     Regional relations:  The U.S. is already engaged in 
promoting &tripartite8 talks involving key players.  As it 
progresses to a more concrete form, the tripartite process 
should be tailored to mesh as effectively as possible with 
other ongoing initiatives, including established Joint 
Verification Mechanisms, regional efforts promoted by South 
Africa, the African Union, and other African countries, as 
well as those of the U.N.  This too represents a long-term 
investment likely destined to pay full dividends only 
following the establishment of a post-transition, more 
effective Kinshasa government.  In the short to medium term, 
it is of critical importance to maintain a consistent and 
strong message rejecting as unacceptable cross-border 
unilateral activities designed to undermine the security or 
influence of neighboring governments within their own 
territories. 
 
U.S. and Mission Constraints 
---------------------------- 
 
20. (C) At the current time, there are two major resource 
constraints limiting, or threatening to limit, U.S. influence 
in key areas. 
 
a) First, available funds to support democracy and governance 
activities are extremely limited.  At this point, for 
example, the U.S. has committed a total of approximately $5 
million over two years in indirect support of the election 
process, and has no funds identified now for direct support 
of scheduled elections.  While USAID has leveraged its 
funding to be particularly visible in early election 
planning, lack of further funding will likely mean declining 
U.S. visibility and influence as the transition process moves 
forward to active preparation and conduct of the DRC 
elections.  Likewise, there are few USG funds available or 
foreseen at this point to assist with improving critically 
important judicial/legal systems, including anti-corruption 
efforts, nor for larger-scale reconciliation efforts which 
are particularly required in the troubled eastern region of 
the DRC. 
 
b) The Embassy is currently slated to lose two of its four 
Political Officer positions in calendar year 05, necessarily 
implying a substantial cutback in Embassy political reporting 
and activities.  This severe reduction in political section 
staffing will mean a major reduction in reporting from the 
troubled eastern region, a general reduction in the frequency 
and depth of contacts among the many and diverse political 
parties and groups as well as within the government, and a 
general loss of USG visibility and activity.  Worse, this 
cutback will likely be occurring over the precise period when 
DRC political activity will be particularly intense, 
associated with the elections.

TAGS: KDEM, PGOV, CG 
SUBJECT: MLC OFFICIAL DESCRIBES INTERNAL TENSIONS, 
ELECTIONS STRATEGY 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  A top official from vice-president 
Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s MLC movement reported tensions between 
Bemba and his number two, Olivier Kamitatu, and described MLC 
efforts to court potential voters in eastern Congo.  Rumors 
of strained relations between Bemba and Kamitatu are nothing 
new.  Kamitatu may be thinking about a Presidency run, but we 
think it unlikely Kamitatu will jump ship now, but if and 
when he ever does, it would be a serious blow to the MLC. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Grumbles in the MLC 
------------------- 
2. (C) Thomas Luhaka, spokesman for Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s Congo 
Liberation Movement\'s (MLC) and leader of its parliamentary 
group, told poloff November 2 that relations between Bemba 
and Olivier Kamitatu are strained.  (Note:  The latter, MLC 
secretary-general since 1999 and National Assembly president 
 
SIPDIS 
since 2003, is one of the more widely-respected public 
figures in the DRC.  End Note.)  Kamitatu skipped a meeting 
of top MLC leaders on November 1, and told Luhaka he thinks 
Bemba is upset with Kamitatu over the \"Ghonda affair.\" 
(Note:  Antoine Ghonda, a long-time friend of Kamitatu, was 
the DRC\'s foreign minister until July 2004, when Bemba fired 
him for being more loyal to President Kabila than to Bemba. 
Ghonda took a job as one of Kabila\'s ambassadors-at-large a 
few weeks later.  End Note.)  Kamitatu also believes Bemba is 
targeting Kamitatu allies within the MLC such as former 
agriculture minister Justin Kangundu, who heads the party\'s 
structure in Bandundu province.  Bemba and Kamitatu are 
likewise at odds over who should head the party\'s structure 
in Kinshasa province.  Luhaka speculated that Kamitatu\'s 
father Cleophas Kamitatu is discouraging his son from 
breaking with Bemba by explaining that for now it makes 
better sense to remain \"in the game\" than outside it.  (Note: 
 The elder Kamitatu, a well-known politician in his own 
right, is a member of the unarmed political opposition but is 
generally regarded as aligned with the MLC.  End Note.) 
 
3. (C) Continuing in the same vein, Luhaka said that he 
himself is frustrated with Bemba because the MLC leader only 
respects those who are independently wealthy, such as public 
works minister Jose Endundo and planning minister Alexis 
Thambwe.  Traditionally, there have been no real political 
parties in the DRC, only \"fan clubs.\"  Many within the MLC 
regard the party as little more than a Bemba fan club Luhaka 
said, and Bemba himself treats less well-off MLC members as 
if they are merely hired help.  Bemba works very closely with 
Endundo on the electoral campaign, for example, but keeps 
Luhaka in the dark.  One sore point within MLC ranks lately 
has been the issue of MLC politicians printing T-shirts with 
their own faces on them.  Bemba recently ordered 40,000 bolts 
of cloth with his own face--and tolerated shirts with 
Endundo\'s face, but was angered when he heard Kamitatu and 
Luhaka wanted to do the same, and refused to listen to 
Luhaka\'s argument that others in the MLC needed to build 
their own base of support in order to be electable.  Former 
president Mobutu deliberately sought to keep his lieutenants 
dependent on him personally, Luhaka commented, and Bemba 
appears to want to do the same. 
 
4. (C) On a more personal level, although Bemba makes 
$200,000 a month and has a small fleet of cars, he failed to 
honor his promise to help Luhaka buy a used vehicle for 
transport around town.  Luhaka bought an $8000 truck on 
credit, and after several months waiting for Bemba to come 
through, raided party funds to pay for it.  Similarly, Luhaka 
is annoyed at having to vacate his centrally-located 
apartment by November 9, because Bemba will not pay to renew 
the lease.  Instead, Luhaka may have to move to one of the 
outer neighborhoods such as Binza, which is \"less secure.\" 
In short, Luhaka said, Bemba does not \"take care of his 
troops.\" 
 
 
Bemba\'s Elections Strategy 
-------------------------- 
5. (C) Commenting on elections strategy, Luhaka said that in 
rural areas where the population is less educated and 
informed, ethnicity will be a key factor and candidates will 
need to sway local \"decision-influencers\" such as traditional 
chiefs.  In urban areas, candidates can make a more direct 
appeal to voters, who are willing to judge candidates more on 
the issues.  This is the case in Bukavu, for example, where 
Gen. Mbuza Mabe (from Equateur) has managed to become 
popular, and whose citizens already appreciate the fact that 
Bemba sent MLC troops to the region.  Another part of MLC 
strategy in the east is to court potential supporters by 
addressing specific complaints (e.g. lifting the state 
monopoly on insurance providers to allow \"SCAR,\" an 
eastern-based company, to compete) and promising to repair 
basic infrastructure in the area.  While some in the 
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) were upset at Bemba\'s 
politicking in the Kivus, \"many\" in the RCD have given up on 
the idea of winning anything through elections and are 
telling their colleagues to support the MLC.  Luhaka 
confirmed that Bemba met with North Kivu governor Eugene 
Serufuli who, in contrast to RCD leader Azarias Ruberwa, has 
made a serious effort to connect with the local population 
there.  As for opposition figure Etienne Tshisekedi, leader 
of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party, 
he is popular in Kinshasa and in the Kasais but, noted 
Luhaka, but is less well-known among younger Congolese, has 
only a weak party machine these days, lacks finances, and is 
in questionable health. 
 
 
Drafting a Constitution 
----------------------- 
6. (C) Asked about Senate efforts to draft a constitution, 
Luhaka said the current draft calls for a president who is 
directly elected but weak, coupled with an indirectly-elected 
prime minister.  Bemba wants a strong, directly-elected 
president, whereas Kamitatu favors an indirectly-elected 
president.  As for the merits of a federal versus unitary 
system of government, Luhaka said there has been no real 
debate yet, but added that people in the east, especially 
businessmen, want to maintain the autonomy they gained under 
the RCD.  Under that regime, forty percent of all revenues 
collected by the authorities was \"remitted\" to the provinces. 
 No one in the area wants to return to war, but easterners 
see the central government as nothing more than a predator, 
and will want to maintain their autonomy. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. (C) The MLC has long stood out in Congolese politics for 
its relative cohesion and the acumen of its leaders, 
especially Kamitatu.  Rumors of Bemba-Kamitatu tensions 
(stemming from Bemba\'s jealousy of Kamitatu\'s talent and 
prestige) are nothing new, but it is unusual for a highly 
visible Bemba loyalist such as Luhaka to speak of them and 
express his own frustrations.  Luhaka may simply have been 
\"fishing\" in an attempt to gauge USG support or lack thereof 
for Bemba.  Kamitatu may well be weighing the prospects for 
his own at the Presidency.  Not coincidentally, his expressed 
preference for \"indirect\" election of the President could 
play well for him, given his current role as National 
Assembly President. We think it unlikely Kamitatu will jump 
ship however, but if and when he ever does, it would be a 
serious blow to the MLC. END COMMENT.

Classified By: Econoff Peter Newman for reasons 1.4 b/d 
 
1. (C) Summary: The Ministry of Energy continues to receive 
proposals for the development of Inga Dam. The most recent 
developments have been an MOU signed with Eskom of South 
Africa and negotiations with MagAlloy (with Reynolds Group 
participation). The MOU signed with Eskom is one step closer 
to the formalization of the Western Corridor (Westcor) 
project. It is not yet official and binding, awaiting 
Presidential approval. MagAlloy does not yet have an 
agreement with the GDRC but is negotiating for participation 
in a consortium for the rehabilitation of Inga I and Inga II 
in return for guaranteed supply to a potential magnesium 
smelter in Pointe Noire, Congo-Brazzaville. Reynolds Group is 
also currently in negotiations to participate in the 
consortium. End summary. 
 
2. (C) DRC Minister of Energy Jean-Pierre Kalema Losona 
signed a MOU with Eskom (South African electricity 
parastatal) for the Western Corridor (Westcor) development 
project in mid-October. (Note: Westcor is a international 
group formed by the electricity companies of the RSA, 
Botswana, Namibia, Angola, and the DRC. Its objective is the 
development of Inga to export electricity to Southern Africa. 
End note.) The MOU concerns only the future development of 
Inga III and Grand Inga. Inga III would bring the system\'s 
total installed capacity to 3,500 MW, while Grand Inga, 
though only a possibility in the very long-term, would raise 
the installed capacity to 40,000 MW. The MOU has an exit 
clause that was written to allow for annulment of the MOU 
with 30 days notice (NFI). The MOU is not official and 
binding as far as the GDRC is concerned, until the Economic 
and Finance Commission (EcoFin) and President Kabila sign off. 
 
3. (SBU) The Ministry of Energy is attempting to corral all 
players in the rehabilitation of the pre-existing Inga I and 
Inga II dams into one consortium. Reynolds Group (with 
partner Rusal) and MagAlloy are now jointly pursuing an 
agreement for rehabilitation of Inga I and II with SNEL 
(National Electric Company) and the Ministry of Energy in 
exchange for dedicated lines to their potential metal plants 
in Pointe Noire. Ambassador Herman Cohen, acting as a 
consultant to Reynolds Group, indicated to econoff that 
Reynolds and MagAlloy will commence negotiations on Nov 22 to 
work out a joint approach to SNEL. The are willing to 
rehabilitate eight turbines at Inga but need to negotiate a 
long-term electricity price to make the project viable. 
MagAlloy will need 175 MW and Reynolds will need 500 MW. 
 
4. (SBU) MagAlloy recently issued a press release stating 
that it has signed a preliminary agreement with SNEL 
(National Electric Company). Reynolds and MagAlloy have also 
taken on SNC-Lavalin (a Canadian electric engineering firm), 
Eskom (RSA), Fluor Daniels, Trans Africa Projects (RSA) and 
the IDC as partners. Ambassador Cohen indicated that the 
group hopes to have an agreement with SNEL by the end of 
2004. (Note: Any deal would have to be approved by the EcoFin 
and the President. Furthermore, the Minstry of Energy is 
planning an international conference on Inga Dam for December 
2004 where it will consider various proposals for Inga I and 
Inga II rehabilitation. End note.) 
 
5. (C) Comment: Eskom and SNC-Lavalin are well positioned to 
have their proposal approved to develop the Inga Dam system. 
They have strong support in the Presidency and will likely 
try to hinder the entry of other energy firms. Reynolds and 
MagAlloy are in a more difficult position and it may well be 
necessary for them eventually to include Eskom and 
SNC-Lavalin as partners in order to have their proposals 
favorably considered. End comment.

SUBJECT: SPORADIC FIGHTING BETWEEN MAI-MAI AND RCD-G 
ELEMENTS IN N.KIVU 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. Mai-Mai elements from the 8th military region 
have engaged in sporadic skirmishes with ex-Congolese 
National Army (ANC) soldiers from the same military region in 
Masisi, N. Kivu beginning the week of October 24th and 
continuing through November 7th. Although civilians have been 
displaced as a result of the violence there is no indication 
of large scale, sustained fighting. UN sources have expressed 
greater concern over the deteriorating security situation in 
Goma, including increased shootings at night, killings, and 
harassment of civilians by military elements. End Summary. 
 
Sporadic Fighting Between Mai-Mai and RCD-G Elements 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (U) MONUC and OCHA sources have reported sporadic fighting 
between Mai Mai elements led by commander Christophe of the 
8th military region\'s 4th brigade and ex-ANC (former armed 
wing of the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma or RCD-G) 
soldiers from the 8th military region\'s 11th brigade headed 
by Colonel Bonne-Annee in the North Kivu localities of 
Bwerema, Bishange, and Bitonga (Masisi territory) beginning 
the week of October 24th and continuing periodically until 
November 5th. According to both sources, the confrontations 
are neither serious nor sustained. 
 
3. (U) It is unclear at this point what has prompted the 
recent fighting, but MONUC sources think it may be a struggle 
for mineral resources in the area, along with ongoing 
animosity and distrust between yet to be integrated Mai-Mai 
and RCD-G military elements. In two related incidents, former 
RCD-G military investigators sent to the area were detained 
for 24 hours by Mai-Mai soldiers. In retaliation, 8th 
military region officials in Goma later arrested two Mai Mai 
leaders over the incident. 
 
4. (U) OCHA has reported the displacement of about 3000 
people in the area near Minova as a result of these conflict. 
As of November 8th, there is no indication of any further 
confrontations between these groups or of any further 
displacement of civilians. 
 
5. (U) According to OCHA sources Mai Mai elements have also 
fought former ex-ANC soldiers in other parts of N.Kivu, 
including a minor skirmish November 3rd at the mining site of 
Ngora, 12 kms from Walikale, presumably for control of local 
mineral resources. The situation in the area, however, is now 
reportedly calm and many of those civilians initially 
displaced have already returned to their homes. 
 
MONUC More Concerned About Increasing Violence in Goma 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6. (U) MONUC sources have expressed greater concern over 
increased violence and lack of discipline by armed elements 
around the Goma area. This mounting insecurity has led to by 
increased shootings at night and a rise in acts of banditry, 
murders, and financial harassment of civilians; a possible 
indication that soldiers may not be receiving their regular 
salaries. Although there is no evidence at this point that 
any particular communities are being targeted, MONUC sources 
fear that incidents involving former RCD-G soldiers and Bashi 
civilians could lead to inter-community fighting. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. (U) Sporadic low-level skirmishes between un-integrated 
Mai-Mai and RCD-G soldiers from the 8th military region 
competing for control of local mineral resources in North 
Kivu is likely to continue. More problematic, however, is the 
deterioration of the security situation in Goma and the 
possibility of inter-community fighting if some of the local 
ethnic groups feel that they are being targeted by RCD-G 
soldiers. It remains to be seen whether N. Kivu Governor 
Eugene Serufuli will take any steps to improve the security 
situation, or whether he will seek to manipulate events for 
his own ends; including the possible dismissal of 8th 
military region commander Obedi Rwabasira.

SUBJECT: OFDA VISIT TO KALEHE AND MINOVA 
 
 
1.   (U) On October 26, OFDA Rep Victor Bushamuka evaluated 
the humanitarian and security situation in Kalehe and Minova 
territories.  Security and humanitarian access has improved 
along the entire axis Kalehe-Minova-Goma, following the 
reestablishment of FARDC control of Minova in September. 
Most of Kalehe and Minova residents living along the road 
have already returned to their villages. However, there is 
still a general fear among the population of possible 
attacks from the hills of Kalehe by Interahamwe elements and 
the remnants of Nkunda forces. In addition, a cholera 
epidemic has emerged in all villages from Kalehe to Minova, 
with 109 cases registered in Bushushu in three weeks and 159 
cases registered in Minova in two weeks. IRC has been 
assisting cholera victims in Kalehe and the DRC government 
has promised assistance to Minova victims. Although the 
epidemic appears to be under control in areas receiving 
assistance, the situation could reach uncontrollable 
proportions in Minova and isolated areas if not quickly and 
appropriately addressed.   END SUMMARY 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2.   (U) OFDA Rep Victor Bushamuka visited the territories 
of Kalehe and Minova on the axis Bukavu-Goma in South-Kivu 
Province on October 26. The object of this visit was to 
assess the security and humanitarian situation in the areas 
after their liberation from forces loyal to ex-RCD/Goma 
commander Laurent Nkunda. During the visit, OFDA Rep stopped 
in Kalehe, Bushushu, Lushebere, Nyabibwe, Kirotse and 
Minova, and met with health care providers and 
administrative authorities to discuss the prevailing health 
and security situation in the areas. 
 
3.   (U) The territories of Kalehe and Minova are located 
between Bukavu (capital of South Kivu) and Goma (capital of 
North Kivu). Kalehe is about 65 km and Minova about 150 km 
north of Bukavu. Nkunda forces passed through these 
territories in late May on their way to briefly capture 
Bukavu and in June-August on their retreat from Bukavu. 
These dissident forces established temporary bases in 
Kalehe, Nyabibwe, and Minova.  The presence of Nkunda\'s 
forces was characterized by killings, harassment, pillaging, 
rapes and other violence that caused massive displacement of 
an estimated 40,000 civilians. Some Kalehe and Bushushu 
residents fled westward to the hills while others took 
refuge eastward on small islands in Lake Kivu. The 
displacement of the population of Lushebere, Nyabibwe, and 
Minova was along ethnic lines, with the Tutsi Rwandophone 
population moving north toward Goma, an area controlled by 
forces loyal to the RCD-G, and non-Rwandophones fleeing to 
small islands including Cigera and Tshime. 
 
4.   (U) 10th Military Region troops initiated an offensive 
against Nkunda\'s forces in July, pushing them north and 
reestablishing government control of Kalehe and Bushushu in 
August, and Nyabibwe and Minova in September. 
 
 
------------------------------ 
Security and Population Return 
------------------------------ 
 
5.   (U) OFDA Rep found, throughout the visit, that the axis 
from Kalehe to Minova was controlled by forces under the 
command of the 10th Military Region. Although these soldiers 
established several military check points along the road, 
vehicles were only checked for weapons at the entry of the 
territory of Kalehe and at the border between South and 
North Kivu. The other checkpoints only provided an 
opportunity for soldiers to ask for cigarettes.  FARDC 
positions could also be seen on hillsides along the road 
from Kalehe to Minova. 
 
6.   (U) According to Kalehe and Minova residents, security 
has improved for villages located along the main roadside. 
Interahamwe living in the National Parc of Kahuzi Biega, as 
well as the remnants of General Nkunda\'s soldiers, often 
attack villages in the hills, raping, pillaging, and killing 
civilians. This has led to the displacement of the 
population from the hills to Kalehe, Nyabibwe and Minova, 
which are currently under FARDC control. Despite the heavy 
presence of FARDC soldiers along the road, there is still a 
general fear among the population of possible attacks in 
villages by Interahamwe or the remnants of Nkunda forces. 
 
7.   (U) The Administrator of the territory of Kalehe 
indicated to OFDA Rep that almost the entire population from 
villages along the road who fled the fighting have already 
returned. The IDP camps that were established in Kalehe, no 
longer exist, as most of the occupants have returned to 
their villages. However, IDPs from the hills of Kalehe, 
whose areas are still considered insecure, remain in Kalehe 
itself, although most have been placed in host families. 
Although many Minova residents have also returned, the 
return of Rwandophones, especially Tutsi, has apparently 
been cautiously slow. In addition, recent confrontations 
between two newly-integrated FARDC battalions, ex-ANC and ex- 
Mai-Mai forces, in the hills near the border of North and 
South Kivu around the village of Bweremana are reported to 
have displaced an estimated 2,000 new IDPs to Minova. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Cholera Outbreak among Returnees 
-------------------------------- 
 
8.   (U) Upon arrival in Bukavu, the OFDA Rep was briefed by 
the medical staff of the International Rescue Committee (IRC- 
USA) regarding the outbreak of cholera in villages along the 
axis Kalehe-Minova. During the visit, OFDA Rep observed that 
the areas most affected by the epidemic were Minova and 
Bushushu. At the time of the visit, Minova had registered 
about 159 cases and three deaths in two weeks, and Bushushu 
registered 109 cases in three weeks. Other areas affected 
included Kalehe center with 6 cases, and Lushebere and 
Nyabibwe with 2 cases each in the week prior to the visit. 
 
9.   (U) According to health officials, these statistics 
represent only a fraction of cases. Only people living 
closer to health centers or those who can travel are able to 
seek assistance from health centers, and therefore, the only 
ones counted. People living in isolated areas often try 
traditional medicine before visiting health centers. The 
case of Mulolo peninsula, a village of pygmies believed to 
be the most heavily hit by the epidemic, was pointed out to 
the OFDA Rep. Because of Mulolo\'s isolation (15 km from 
Nyabibwe) only two people from Mulolo have been so far able 
to reach the health center since the outbreak was first 
announced three weeks ago in the area. 
 
10.  (U) Cholera bacteria proliferate in areas with 
inadequate sanitation facilities. The majority of initial 
victims were IDPs on the island of Cigera, which had no 
clean water nor proper sanitation facilities. In addition, 
strong seismic activity in July 2003 in the aftermath of the 
2002 volcanic eruption in Goma damaged a number of wells in 
Bushushu, Kalehe, and Minova that required constant 
maintenance.  Due to lack of maintenance during the period 
of insecurity, most wells were found to require major 
rehabilitation when people returned to their villages. As a 
result, returnees in these areas relied on the lake and 
river as main sources of water, which is believed to have 
contributed to the spread of a number of diarrheic diseases, 
including cholera. 
 
----------------------- 
Humanitarian Assistance 
----------------------- 
 
11.  (U) IRC has been assisting cholera victims with all 
necessary medication in the territory of Kalehe, including 
Kalehe center, Bushushu, and Nyabibwe. Isolation structures 
have also been established and the damaged water systems in 
Kalehe have been rehabilitated by IRC. New wells were also 
contracted in areas where the population has increased due 
to a high influx of IDPs.  Unlike in Kalehe and Nyabibwe, 
Minova cholera victims do not yet have similar level of 
assistance. MSF (Medecin Sans Frontiere) Holland started to 
provide perfusion drugs to the Minova health center. 
However, according to Minova health providers, the 
assistance does not yet meet their needs in medication. In 
addition, at the time of the OFDA Rep\'s visit, no structure 
existed for the isolation of cholera patients in Minova. The 
DRC government, through the Central Health Bureau and the 
Societe Nationale de Hydraulic Rural, promised antibiotics 
to the health center and pledged to rehabilitate the damaged 
wells in the area. Until the DRC government fulfills its 
promise, the cholera epidemic probably will continue to 
claim victims in Minova. 
 
---------- 
Conclusion 
---------- 
12. (U) Security improvement and people\'s desire to quickly 
re-establish their economic activities has expedited the 
movement of people among villages along the axis Kalehe- 
Minova. Heavy movements of people not only facilitates 
exchange of goods, but also the transmission of diseases. 
Although the epidemic appears to be under control in areas 
that receive assistance, it might reach uncontrollable 
proportions if the situation in Minova and its surrounding 
isolated villages is not carefully monitored and quickly 
addressed.

Classified By: Ambassador Roger Meece.  Reason 1.4 (b/d) 
 
1.  (C)  The Ambassador paid a courtesy call on Minister for 
Scientific Research Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda at his office 
November 8.  Kamanda had earlier contacted the Ambassador by 
telephone requesting such a meeting as soon as could be 
arranged.  (Note: Kamanda holds his current portfolio under 
the Sun City Accord as a member of the political \"opposition\" 
with his own party, the Common Front of Nationalists. 
Kamanda is a former Foreign Minister during the last years of 
the Mobutu regime, again at the time representing 
\"opposition\" forces.  He fled into exile for a period 
following the May  1997 seizure of Kinshasa by Laurent 
Kabila,s ADFL foces.  End note.) 
 
2.  (C)  After opening pleasantries, Kamanda ran through a 
list of current political issues, gradually building a case 
testifying to the relative inability of current major party 
leaders to move transition political processes forward in a 
timely fashion.  Continuing, he commented that the remaining 
old generation politicians (e.g., Etienne Tshisekedi) had 
already demonstrated their inability to govern adequately, 
and that some of the newer very young people on the scene 
appeared to lack adequate experience or skills.  Therefore, 
Kamanda concluded another option should be available.  He 
said he wished to confide that he would be putting his own 
candidacy forward in Presidential elections, and added that 
he would like U.S. support. 
 
3.  (C)  The Ambassador responded firmly that the U.S. 
strongly supports open and fair elections, but would maintain 
a position of strict neutrality regarding individual 
candidates or parties.  He asked if Kamanda plans a public 
announcement of his candidacy soon; Kamanda hedged his 
response suggesting that timing would depend on events in the 
country.  The Ambassador also inquired about Kamanda,s 
ability to conduct a national campaign in terms of 
organization and funds.  Kamanda expressed confidence, 
implying that the essentials of a nation-wide provincial 
network are already in place. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment: There is already a great deal of political 
positioning in anticipation of elections, and at least some 
tentative moves toward coalition-building.  It is unclear if 
Kamanda, with a political base in Bandundu province and 
somewhat limited national exposure, is in fact serious about 
pursuing an independent candidacy as the nominee of his 
relatively small  party.  Alternatively, Kamanda could be 
laying the groundwork seeking to increase his bargaining 
position in negotiations with one or more other parties. 
Kamanda,s disclosure in any event is another sign that the 
early electoral season is very much underway.  End comment.

SUBJECT: UN TEAM TO SHINKOLOBWE: MINE NOT A PROLIFERATION 
THREAT BUT SHOULD STAY CLOSED 
 
REF: KINSHASA 611 
 
1. (U) A UN team, composed of officials from IAEA, UNEP and 
WHO, visited Shinkolobwe mine in Katanga Province from Oct 25 
to Nov 04 and concluded that the mine should remain closed 
due to risks of mine collapse and potential chronic exposure 
to ionising radiation. The objective of the trip was to 
determine mine safety and health hazards to former workers, 
and not a safeguards and proliferation assessment. A UN press 
release announced the mine was vacated and no evidence of 
uranium mining was found. Although the mine was unstable and 
subject to additional cave-ins, team member Alain Pasche, 
stated to UN press, \"No immediate risks to the environment 
were observed, though we have taken samples of water, soil 
and sediments, which will be further analysed in Switzerland 
for heavy metal concentrations.\" 
 
2. (SBU) IAEA safeguards officer Bernard Weiss told econoff 
in a phone conversation on  Oct 29 that IAEA sent a 
safeguards assessment team to Shinkolobwe in May 2004. The 
safeguards assessment team concluded there was not a 
safeguards/proliferation risk from the mine. He did note that 
the higher than normal levels of radiation at Shinkolobwe are 
to be expected due to the presence of natural uranium and 
other heavy metals in the area. Although this does not pose a 
proliferation risk, it could pose an alpha radiation health 
hazard for the workers who breathed mine dust on a daily 
basis. This assessment mirrors the USG assessment in March 
2004 (reftel). 
 
3. (SBU) Comment: Hype about Shinkolobwe, where the uranium 
for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs was mined, is largely 
created by a sensationalist press. Both USG and IAEA have 
determined that there is not a nuclear safeguards or 
proliferation risk from Shinkolobwe. The artisanal miners 
have been removed from the mine. The UN team and local mining 
sector contacts report that all mining has stopped. Although 
miners previously at Shinkolobwe might be at higher risk for 
health problems due to inhalation of radioactive dust, 
naturally elevated levels of radioactivity should not be 
confused with proliferation of highly radioactive substances.

SUBJECT: THE CENTER CANNOT HOLD: GOMA AND NORTH KIVU 
INSECURITY MOUNTING 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.4 b/d. 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  A wave of what appear to be executions in 
Goma, as well as clashes throughout North Kivu between 
military nominally responsive to regional military commander 
Obed and militia loyal to Governor Eugene Serufuli, suggest 
that Serufuli\'s grip on his province might be slipping. 
Monuc believes the current instability results in part from 
political manipulation by elements in Kinshasa, and Serufuli 
agrees.  Whatever the cause, North Kivu -- and Goma in 
particular -- seems potentially to be the next \"crisis site\" 
in eastern Congo.  End Summary. 
 
Stepping Up The Heat on RCD Bastion Of North Kivu 
 
2. (C)  North Kivu Governor Eugene Serufuli, long the master 
political juggler of the DRC, artfully balancing Kigali and 
Kinshasa\'s interests against his own, may finally be 
embroiled in a situation from which he will not easily 
wriggle free.  For the last six months his stronghold, Goma, 
has effectively been surrounded by about 20,000 forces loyal 
to Kinshasa, dispatched to eastern Congo to confront the 
threat posed by rebellious general Laurent Nkunda, the 
despoiler of Bukavu.  Although Nkunda\'s forces seem to have 
dissipated, and Nkunda himself disappeared, the loyalist 
forces have not been recalled, but instead have remained in a 
loose ring around Goma, with some even stationed in the 
northern part of North Kivu itself.  Over the last two months 
in particular there have been sporadic clashes between 
elements of the 8th and 10th military regions (North and 
South Kivu, respectively), whose regional commanders (Obed 
and Mabe) are at odds.  Kinshasa regards Serufuli with 
mistrust, but views Obed even more negatively.  Indeed, 
Kabila has stated to diplomats that he considers Obed to have 
facilitated Nkunda\'s insurreection, and Obed has several 
times refused to fully implement orders from the FARDC chain 
of command.  Secure in Goma, however, and with backing from 
Serufuli, Obed has been a difficult issue with which to come 
to grips. 
 
3. (C)  Over the last several weeks, however, a wedge seems 
to have been increasingly driven between Serufuli and Obed. 
Ex-RCD military responsible, at least nominally, to Obed have 
been robbing citizens and even stores in Goma, and in 
outlying areas, raping women and burning homes in villages. 
Serufuli several times told PolCouns that the problem is that 
these soldiers are not being paid -- unlike compatriots in 
neighboring military regions, he said.  (Note:  Kinshasa has 
been marginally better than usual in its record of paying the 
troops in the field and the result, by-and-large, has been a 
slightly better record in regards to respecting civilians\' 
rights in most places.  We know, for instance, that troops in 
South Kivu, Maniema and Kisangani have been being paid at 
least something, sometimes.  We don\'t know that the same is 
true of 8th district North Kivu troops. End Note.) 
 
Kinshasa Taking A More Direct Hand? 
 
4. (C) In the last week, the situation has taken an even more 
foreboding turn.  A man whom Serufuli identified to PolCouns 
as a \"lawyer and investigator from Kinshasa\" was killed 
execution-style four days ago, and one night later a police 
captain, another lawyer and an \"innocent bystander\" were 
murdered the same way.  Other victims of what appears to be a 
targeted campaign (as distinct from the more random 
robberies) include a student and a human rights NGO worker 
(Congolese).  When PolCouns asked Serufuli for more detail 
regarding Kinshasa\'s investigation, Serufuli said he was not 
fully informed but believed it to be aimed at military 
misconduct.  He insisted, however, that he retained full 
confidence in General Obed.  Monuc Head-of-Office M\'hand 
Njuzi said that Monuc\'s investigations indicate that all the 
crimes, including the recent executions, have been conducted 
by RCD soldiers. Monuc has proposed increased joint 
(Monuc-FARDC-police) patrols of the city to address the 
immediate security situation.  Meanwhile, particularly in 
outlying villages such as Kanyabayonga (near Butembu in the 
northern part of the province) Serufuli\'s militia, assisted 
often by students, increasingly are facing-off against 
soldiers trying to pillage neighborhoods or entire villages. 
 
Comment 
 
5. (C)  Current events could very possibly represent the 
fruit of a Kinshasa-orchestrated (read Presidency) campaign. 
The political class has speculated for months about a 
possible deal with Serufuli, maybe involving a Ministerial 
portfolio, but Serufuli has prefered to build his base and 
authority in his fiefdom in North Kivu.  If Kinshasa\'s hand 
indeed is in the Goma events, then it seems likely to us that 
this could be as a way to ratchet up pressure on Serufuli to 
\"make a deal,\" and become de facto part of a larger Kabila 
camp. This scenario would greatly advance PPRD interests in 
North Kivu (where otherwise they will not be strong), and 
potentially allow Serufuli to remain in place, even as the 
elected governor.  Given that such a deal by Serufuli (with 
either the PPRD or MLC, for instance) would threaten RCD 
interests, it is also possible that the current wave of 
violence is being orchestrated by RCD hardliners such as 
Bizima Karaha, to threaten and weaken Serufuli.  What the 
case, if the security situation truly spirals out of control, 
Kinshasa could be in a position to dispatch FADRC troops into 
the province to restore order and protect the citizens - 
where they doubtless would come into conflict with Serufuli\'s 
militia, sparking a wider confrontation.  Serufuli has not 
yet lost his grip, by any means, but probably within the next 
few weeks it will be clear whether he can regain full 
control, or begin instead to drop some of the political balls 
he has so artfully juggled.

1. The following responses are geared to reftel questions. 
Post believes the DRC has made credible progress on its 
outstanding issues, and we will continue to stress to the 
GDRC the importance of doing so. 
 
2. In May 2004, the GDRC finalized and implemented procedures 
for issuing official demobilization certificates for children 
associated with armed groups. Although a small number of 
demobilized child soldiers have not received their 
certificates, in general, the process is working well. 
 
3. Since October 2003, the GDRC has demobilized about 2,000 
children associated with armed groups, including a number of 
children who were demobilized before their units were sent to 
eastern Congo in June 2004. 
 
4. A number of GDRC military and civilian officials respond 
quickly and helpfully to NGO and UN agency requests for 
assistance with child protection issues. For example, MONUC 
child protection officers have worked with prison officials 
to remove children from general prison populations, and 
military commanders have assisted in demobilizing children 
associated with armed groups. In addition, earlier this year, 
judicial authorities in South Kivu started legal proceedings 
against a known child soldier recruiter. 
 
5. The national disarmament, demobilization, and 
reintegration (DDR) technical committee is working with UN 
agencies, donors and NGOs to ensure that the needs of 
children associated with armed groups are adequately 
addressed in the national World Bank-funded DDR plan. The 
section of the national DDR plan associated with children 
will be the first implemented.

REF: A. KINSHASA 478 
     B. KINSHASA 1866 
 
1. (C) Summary: Minister of Budget Francois Muamba stressed 
GDRC compliance with the IMF program and progress on 
government reforms during a recent call with the Ambassador. 
Muamba emphasized the good faith of the GDRC to comply with 
IMF parameters in spite of some minor slippage. Budgeting for 
elections, pro-poor programs, and military integration are 
all being considered by the GDRC. Though increased internal 
revenue may help pay for a small portion of these programs, 
significant financing gaps will still exist in the 2005 
budget, and external budget support will be needed. 
Improvements of internal expenditure controls are proceeding 
slowly due to technical difficulties. Advances in 
transparency and self-suffiency will take time, but the GDRC 
appears to be cognizant of the challenges it faces and is 
working on remedies. End summary. 
 
IMPROVED BUDGET PLANNING AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE IMF PROGRAM 
 
2. (SBU) Minister of Budget Francois Muamba stressed on 
November 4 that the GDRC was doing well to stay within the 
parameters of the IMF program, and that it is working on 
improving internal expenditure controls. Although there has 
been some slippage due to exchange rate changes and to a lack 
of spending discipline, the GDRC is on track to have its 2005 
budget prepared on time and within IMF parameters. Of key 
importance will be funding for social programs and reduction 
of internal debt. 
 
3. (C) Muamba also made clear that some funding for military 
integration and elections will be included in the 2005 
budget. In particular, he noted that USD 75 million is being 
considered for military and police integration. He pointed 
out that in spite of increased internal revenue, a 
substantial financial gap remains that can only be covered by 
external assistance, . 
 
BALANCING INCREASING INTERNAL FINANCES AND TAX REFORM 
 
4. (C) Muamba told the Ambassador there has been a 32 percent 
increase in government revenue from 2003 to 2004, and the 
GDRC and IMF expect a similar increase in 2005. The GDRC 
acknowledges, however, that it would need to significantly 
increase government revenues to be self-sustainable. 
 
5. (C) Stressing the importance of private sector investment, 
the Ambassador said that some formal sector businesses have 
complained about numerous fees and taxes that apparently are 
being arbitrarily imposed. In order to promote economic 
development, he added, there must be a clear and open 
dialogue between the GDRC and the private business community. 
Muamba stated that such problems are being discussed at the 
level of the Economic and Financial Commission (EcoFin) and 
will result in a new and consolidated tax structure, 
detailing which taxes and fees are required. A 
decentralization law is also planned to give greater local 
taxation authority to the provinces. Muamba did not give any 
indication of when these reforms may occur. 
 
INCREASING PRO-POOR SPENDING 
 
6. (C) The Minister assured the Ambassador the GDRC will 
increase pro-poor spending in its 2005 budget. Although he 
stated that pro-poor spending is at the heart of budget 
planning, Muamba outlined three factors that inhibit pro-poor 
spending: 
 
--Pro-poor spending is underreported due to technical 
difficulties in the current disbursement system and 
electronic accounting program used by the Ministry of 
Finance. 
 
--Public tenders are required for most pro-poor programs per 
World Bank regulations, and it has taken some time to 
familiarize government ministries and agencies with such 
procedures. 
 
--Congolese enterprises are not equipped to submit bids in 
open tenders due to a lack of capital. Though many could 
tender competitive bids, they would require partial advance 
payments to begin work on a project. 
 
LOW PUBLIC SALARIES POORLY DISTRIBUTED 
 
7. (C) The Ambassador noted that payment of public sector 
salaries is crucial to the budget process and to the 
Transition in general. For example, when soldiers are not 
paid, they become a security problem which could put 
elections at risk. Muamba replied that soldiers are paid 
regularly, however, they are poorly paid. The Ministry of 
Finance delivers monthly sacks of cash to distribution points 
throughout the country, but Muamba acknowledged that funds 
sometimes disappear en route. The Ministry of Budget is 
trying to end the use of sacks of cash and move to an 
electronic transfer system to reduce the number of people 
through whose hands cash passes. 
 
PROMOTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
 
8. (SBU) The Ambassador returned to the importance foreign 
investment must play in future growth of the DRC economy. The 
Ambassador cited the DRC\'s near last placement on the World 
Bank\'s business start-up index. While the USG realizes that 
resolving many of the bureaucratic hurdles is an ongoing 
process and takes time, necessary changes need to be made 
more quickly to expand the formal economy. The Ambassador 
suggested that the successful completion of an agreement with 
Phelps-Dodge (currently negotiating with the GDRC to form a 
joint-venture with Gecamines for a copper and cobalt mine in 
Katanga province, per reftels) would send a strong positive 
signal to international investors. 
 
NO BUDGETARY SUPPORT BUT TRY FOR HIPC FULFILLMENT 
 
9. (C) Muamba twice requested bilateral budgetary support 
during the course of the meeting. The Ambassador answered 
that the USG\'s substantial bilateral assistance program does 
not provide direct budgetary support. He noted, however, that 
the U.S. Administration is committed to working with Congress 
to obtain funding for HIPC debt relief as soon as possible in 
accordance with HIPC terms. This would serve to alleviate 
some significant budgetary obligations for the GDRC. 
 
COMMENT 
 
10. (C) Comment: Muamba demonstrated that the GDRC 
acknowledges the significant challenges it faces to improve 
government operations and promote economic growth. These 
challenges will take time to resolve, and international 
pressure and support are key to continued progress. U.S. 
fulfillment of its HIPC obligations to the DRC would help 
support ongoing reform efforts, while the GDRC is 
simultaneously staying within IMF program parameters and 
continuing to service its bilateral debt. End comment.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROBIN R. SANDERS FOR REASON 1.4 (D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Below follows an analysis of current 
political and economic atmospherics in the Republic of Congo, 
including points recently noted by the country,s President, 
Denis Sassou Nguesso, regarding his efforts to truly put 
Congo on a &democratic path8 and change once and for all 
Congo,s lack of transparency culture, history of bad 
business practices, and - personally important to him - the 
country,s negative international image. In the Post,s view, 
there are many positive signs, but there also remain 
challenges on both the macro and micro level in both the 
political and economic sectors. It will be up to President 
Sassou whether the country can build on the current progress. 
All members of his government are not reformers, and he is 
surrounded by many hardliners still clinging to their old 
Soviet habits and perspectives.  Although for now, Sassou 
gets credit for trying to be a reformer.  He still needs to 
figure out how to either bring the hardliners on board and 
stop the ankle biting and undermining, or take a tougher more 
politically challenging path of removing them from government 
(The planned Cabinet reshuffle and reduction has yet to take 
place - reftel).  This will be the test of his leadership and 
legacy and whether he has truly changed his spots. 
 
 
OVERALL ATMOSPHERICS: 
 
2.  (C) The Republic of the Congo, with only three years 
since the end of major conflict behind it, wants to be viewed 
in the region and by the international community as having 
turned the corner to respectability, and good leadership both 
economically and politically.  Clearly there is surface 
evidence that things have improved.  Brazzaville city is 
showing signs that people believe the country is now stable. 
New construction starts are at an all time high, streets are 
clean, and new businesses (hotels, restaurants) are popping 
up all over town. Long gone also are the security checkpoints 
in the usually troubled BaCongo neighborhood (an area where 
many southerners live). Although there was a recent robbery 
on the Pointe Noire-Brazzaville train, by all accounts, it 
was a well-organized pirating commercial venture with likely 
complicity by individuals who are or were members of 
government, especially security force elements. The recent 
train attack was initially reported as a \"Ninja Operation,\" 
referring to those previously or still connected to rebel 
leader Pastor Ntumi. However, the ragtag remnants of Ntumi\'s 
Ninjas do not have the capacity -- trucks, gasoline, 
organization, or  well-armed manpower -- to pull off such an 
operation, including moving tons of goods across the border 
to Democratic Republic of Congo. Outside of the train attack, 
Congo has been calm, and may be past the stage of Post using 
the term \"fragile calm.\" The real question is whether Congo 
can make more political and economic progress and solidify 
the changes to date? 
 
ECONOMIC PROGRESS MUST CONTINUE: 
 
3.  (C) On the economic front, with President Sassou,s 
personal commitment using his very able Finance Minister, 
Congo has cleaned up transparency in its oil sector, 
presented decent budgets the last two years, appears to be on 
track for a positive December IMF Board vote, and is working 
out payment schedules with bilateral and multilateral 
creditors comparable with Paris and London Clubs. Most of 
these major changes, particularly in oil transparency, have 
been accomplished in the last 18 months.  Finance Minister 
Andely, who is respected by the international financial 
community as well as the diplomatic and NGO establishments in 
Congo, does not enjoy the same respect from many in the 
37-member cabinet. Many in the cabinet are hardliners who 
want cronyism and the culture of payoffs to remain, and make 
it their daily duty to ankle bite and undermine him at every 
turn.  Andely,s efforts are on target and Sassou has 
strongly supported his technician.  The much-needed changes 
include: more oil and overall transparency; streamed lined 
Ministerial and national budgets; working with creditors, 
paying down debt; and trying to end the culture of impunity 
and illicit enrichment every step of the way. Andley,s work 
to meet IMF measures, has taken on a term used by the 
hardliners called \"Andely-ism,\" and the Finance Minister has 
survived solely because of Sassou\'s commitment to turn the 
country around and his desire to leave an image and legacy 
quite different from his past leadership during the 
mid-to-late 20th century. 
 
4.  (C) There are a number of hardliners in both the cabinet 
and national assembly who are resistant to these more 
transparent, good governance moves. The hardliners include: 
the Minister of Government Coordination and Transport Isidore 
Mvouba, who holds the PM-like position in Congo; Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and the Francophonie Rodolphe 
Adada; National Security Advisor Jean Dominque Okemba; 
Minister of Planning Pierre Moussa, Minister of Territorial 
Administration Francois Ibovi, Superior Education Minister 
Ossebi; Security Minister Pierre Oba; Senate President 
Noumazalaye, and National Assembly President Tchicaya ) to 
name just a few. Given the positions of these hardliners, 
sustained changes ) particularly politically ) will 
continue to be an uphill battle.  The balancing act for 
Sassou is that many of these hardliners not only represent 
key political support as a result of their clans being close 
to Sassou,s Mbochi, but also because Sassou could not have 
won the conflicts of 1997-1999 without the support of Likoula 
ethnic group leaders such as Senate President Noumzalaye and 
Security Minister Oba, in addition, of course to Angolan 
support. 
 
 
POLITICAL FRONT - PROGRESS, BUT MORE CHANGES NEEDED: 
 
5.  (C) Clearly more improvement has been made on the 
economic side of the ledger than the political, although we 
have to note there has been improved governance over the last 
18 months in several areas such as: some outreach to NGOs; TV 
coverage of parliament sessions; ministers called to defend 
positions before Parliament and on occasions talking to the 
press; defense of the national budget before the national 
assembly; publishing national budget and oil sector 
contracts; and other government reports; Sassou holding 
western-style press conferences and making state of union 
speeches before parliament; and, so on. However, Congo must 
overcome a few more challenges in order to have sustained 
good governance and for the country,s image to truly change. 
For example, the opposition needs to be allowed to have more 
dialogue and access to the press, and the NGO and civil 
society communities need to be viewed as an asset to public 
policy, not threats. 
 
6.  (C) There is some evidence that Sassou is trying to do 
more to improve the political front and build on the 
governance improvement to date . He has tried to move forward 
on a much-needed cabinet reshuffle/size reduction, but has 
not yet found his legs to do so (reftel). Many of the 
hardliners who need to be removed so that more/more good 
governance can take place, helped and served Sassou over many 
years doing the communist era, including in later years 
during the 2002 elections. It is uncertain what kind of 
backlash would take place if any of these powerful, 
clan-based hardliners were removed from their post, and what 
effect ) if any ) this would have on emerging stability. 
What appears to be happening is change over several stages. 
Sassou\'s Peoples, Workers Party (PCT) is rumored to be on 
the verge of a split within the next 3-6 months, between 
reformers under the umbrella of a new party which will 
reportedly be called the &Union for the Republic,8 led by 
Sassou, and old hardliners of the PCT, which could include 
many of the current cabinet. Thus far, there is no single 
leader among the hardliners and their individual personal 
financial interests have, to date, outweighed any organized 
anti-Sassou efforts.  One of the biggest challenges in 
addition to addressing the inner circle leadership issues is 
to find ways to cut the undermining by the hardliners in the 
short term. 
 
7.  (C) In a recent conversation that Ambassador had with 
Sassou at his hometown in Oyo on November 4-5, 2004 he noted 
that he did not have enough people around him &ready to 
accept8 long term change. His daughter, close confidant and 
Public Relations Counselor, Mrs. Lemoumba, told Ambassador 
during same period that it was difficult to really identify 
who is inhibiting progress, transparency, and change because 
the blockage can be as far down as the director or office 
level of a Ministry. (Note: Ambassador was invited to spend 2 
informal days in Sassou,s hometown in Oyo to have a more 
one-on-one dialogue on Congo issues in general. Policy 
conversations in Oyo only included Sassou, Mrs. Lemoumba, and 
the Ambassador. End Note.) 
 
8.  (C) Despite what appears to be a commitment at the top 
with Sassou for more good governance and reform, political 
missteps continue and old habits die-hard.  Some in the inner 
circle clearly act in ways that fly in the face of 
transparency. That being said, the hardliners are smart 
enough to have learned to \"talk the talk\" about democracy, 
good governance and transparency, but when out of view do not 
\"walk the walk,\" with the press, with the NGO community, and 
with the opposition.  For example, recently the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs called in freelance journalists linked to 
international press such as Reuters, PANA, AFP, Africa Number 
One, etc., many who also hold jobs in the national media, as 
well as the BBC correspondent, and \"implied\" that their 
accreditation could be pulled if they reported issues that 
sullied Congo,s image. BBC headquarters was later asked to 
pull its correspondent, the only independent reporter in 
Congo, seemingly without cause because of his reporting on 
the challenges that remain in Congo. In another case, one 
hardline Minister recently engaged with an NGO and implied 
that its exoneration could be pulled if it did not allow \"its 
list of bidders\" to receive contracts. These are just a few 
glimmers of the challenges that remain to transparency 
despite the progress noted thus far. 
 
 
NEXT STEPS: BUILD ON PROGRESS, CONTINUE TO REFORM, AND 
NEUTRALIZE HARDLINERS 
 
9.  (C) The near future for Congo has always been clear - it 
rests in the hands of President Sassou and how he continues 
to move forward on the issues noted above. Ambassador has had 
some discussions with other reformers to see where they think 
the country is going. It has come to light that Sassou seeks 
a lot of advice from former Ghanaian President Rawlings.  One 
could described this frequent contact as one former dictator 
turned \"democrat of sorts\" (Rawlings) giving advice to one 
(Sassou) who wants to be remembered in the same light -- 
dictator who changed his spots, wants to change his 
country,s image, and is trying to move in the right 
direction politically and economically.  Sassou still has 
some old habits, some he recognizes, however, others he does 
not -- at least yet. For example, he still dabbles in CEMAC 
regional issues in a desire to control or influence who is in 
leadership positions in neighboring countries.  Relations 
with DRC continue to have ups and downs, and in 2003, reports 
indicate that he played a role in removing Central African 
Republic President Patasse. For now, let,s give him the 
benefit of the doubt and put him in the reformer camp. We 
will need to watch and see if this is a faade or a true 
change of spots. Congo still has a ways to go, but in two 
years there have been some visible changes, but long-term 
success will be determined by continued and expanded changes 
and, in the end, the sustainability of these changes. For 
now, the IMF called for measures are in place, and the 
hardliners are unhappy. It is clear to Post that the 
reformers will need to be successful with the IMF and other 
good governance efforts in order to neutralize the hardliners 
enough that they no longer are a political risk.

SUBJECT: POSSIBLE MASSACRE AT KILWA 
 
REF: A. KINSHASA 1931 
     B. KINSHASA 1965 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  According to sources in Katanga province, 
the October 2004 \"insurgency\" at Kilwa on the Congo-Zambia 
border was more likely a tragic farce than a real attack, and 
government troops may have massacred dozens of civilians when 
they recaptured the town.  Explanations for the incident 
vary, ranging from local resentment against a nearby mine to 
a conflict between Katangans within the Presidency.  The 
allegations of a massacre of civilians by government troops 
are believable, and--given the high-level Kinshasa interest 
in Dikulushi mine--we can expect GDRC authorities to obstruct 
any investigation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) Poloff visited Lubumbashi and Kalemie in DRC\'s Katanga 
province from Nov. 7-13 and met with local civil and military 
officials, diplomats, U.N. and international NGO workers, and 
members of civil society.  The following--a dissection of the 
recent \"attack\" on the town of Kilwa--is the first in a 
series of short cables on the trip. 
 
 
Kilwa - the Basic Facts 
----------------------- 
3. (U) In mid-October, a small group of armed men seized the 
town of Kilwa near the Congo-Zambia border, which is about 
50km from Dikulushi, a copper and silver mine run by 
Australian company Anvil Mining Limited.  (Comment:  One of 
the mine\'s shareholders is Augustin Katumba Mwanke, former 
governor of Katanga province and a top adviser to President 
Kabila.  End Comment.)  Government troops--who had vacated 
Kilwa only the day before--responded quickly, and within two 
days had captured the insurgent leader and reasserted control 
over the town.  Military authorities in Lubumbashi later 
arrested prominent local politician Christian Mwando Simba in 
connection with the events, releasing him after approximately 
two weeks\' detention.  (Note: Mwando\'s father, Charles Mwando 
Simba, is chairman of the political committee in the National 
Assembly.  End Note.) 
 
4. (C) Gen. Dieugentil Alengbia Nzambe, commander of the 6th 
Military Region, told poloff the Kilwa incident was \"not 
serious.\"  The \"insurgents\" attacked only after the regular 
contingent of troops had withdrawn, and got most of their 
weapons from local armories.  Alengbia refused to speculate 
on who or what was behind the attack, but he said that 
contrary to media reports, there were no Portugese-speakers 
among the rebels. 
 
 
Massacre at Kilwa? 
------------------ 
5. (C) One expatriate NGO source who visited Kilwa after the 
incident said locals told him the rebels numbered no more 
than thirty or forty and had no problems with the local 
populace.  Several hundred government troops captured the 
town almost without a fight, then apparently went after 
civilian collaborators.  The source said that locals resent 
the mine because it employs no Congolese and has done nothing 
for them, but added that Anvil is currently looking to 
partner up with one or more international NGOs to implement 
local development projects. 
 
6. (C) In the opinion of a MONUC official who also traveled 
to Kilwa to investigate the incident, the whole thing was a 
sham.  The locals, mainly of the Bemba tribe, were indeed 
angry at Anvil.  There were only about five or six armed 
rebels, led by a 24-year old (who conveniently died of his 
wounds before authorities could question him).  These rebels 
quickly recruited local youths to their cause, did no damage 
to the town, and expected government troops to support them. 
They were completely surprised when troops of Pweto garrison 
commander Col. Ademar (phonetic)--reportedly an ally of Air 
Force commander Gen. John Numbi and Mai-Mai leader 
Gedeon--counterattacked instead.  Local inhabitants fled when 
the army arrived, and soldiers then began to \"settle scores\" 
and loot the town.  The MONUC official said locals also 
pointed out a mass grave that they claimed contained perhaps 
twenty to thirty bodies.  (Comment:  To date, no one in the 
GDRC or MONUC has commented publicly on the possibility of a 
massacre at Kilwa.  End Comment.) 
 
 
Mixed Reactions Among Diplomats 
------------------------------- 
7. (C) Lubumbashi-based diplomats were mixed in their 
assessments.  A South African diplomat expressed appreciation 
that the government\'s reaction to Dikulushi was strong and 
swift, even if it was heavy-handed, because such incidents 
were likely to occur more frequently in the run-up to 
elections.  A Belgian diplomat agreed it was likely a 
massacre took place in Kilwa, and asked rhetorically how long 
the international community could tolerate such misrule in 
the Congo.  The diplomat speculated that the Kilwa incident 
stemmed from a conflict in President Kabila\'s inner circle, 
between members of the Luba Katanga tribe (such as Air Force 
commander John Numbi) and those from other Katangan tribes 
(like Katumba Mwanke), and said it was likely President 
Kabila knows nothing of the massacre or the extent of the 
internal conflict.  (Note: The Luba Katanga are the dominant 
tribe in the province.  They were the backbone of a massive 
ethnic-cleansing campaign in Katanga in the early 1990s.  End 
Note.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (C) In the DRC, skirmishes over mines are not unheard of, 
but they more typically take place in the Kivus and Orientale 
Province, not Katanga.  It is clear that this particular 
\"attack\" was too weak to succeed on its own, and that the 
rebels were merely pawns in a larger game.  The allegations 
of a massacre of civilians by government troops are entirely 
believable, and--given the high-level Kinshasa interest in 
Dikulushi mine--we can expect GDRC authorities to obstruct 
any investigation.  We will continue to raise Kilwa with 
presidential advisors, if only to give notice that we suspect 
the possibility of foul play. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: DRC VISIT TO CHINA, N. KOREA - HYDROELECTRICITY 
AND ROOF TILES MAJOR PROSPECTS 
 
REF: REFTEL: KINSHASA 1958 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.4 b/d. 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  Presidential advisor Andre Kapanga, the 
second-ranking official on the DRC delegation to China and 
North Korea, told PolCouns November 17 that meetings focused 
on investment opportunities in the DRC, particularly 
hydroelectrical generation and production of roof tiles. 
China offered the DRC a $3 million line-of-credit, in 
addition to $1.5m to purchase office supplies for the 
Congolese Foreign Ministry.  A second visit to China is 
planned in March or April, although Kapanga said he didn\'t 
think the Congolese would go back to North Korea, given that 
the Koreans are \"even worse off\" than the Congolese.  Kapanga 
said that although the Congolese delegation met in both 
countries with military elements there was no discussion of 
trade in minerals, nor will Congo be receiving military 
assistance from either China or North Korea.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C)  A six-person Congolese delegation led by Foreign 
Minister Ramazani Baya and Presidential advisor Andre Kapanga 
visited China and North Korea at Chinese and Korean expense 
November 3-13.  In China the Congolese visited Beijing, 
Shanghai and Chenji (a free trade zone on the mainland across 
from Hong Kong); in North Korea they were limited to the 
capital city.  According to Kapanga, the Congolese delegation 
made clear the DRC\'s interest in attracting investment, 
particularly for assembly operations which could employ 
unskilled Congolese labor. 
 
Chinese Offer Line of Credit 
 
3. (C)  Kapanga said that during a meeting with the Chinese 
Deputy Foreign Minister, the Chinese government offered the 
DRC a $3 million line-of-credit which the DRC can use for 
purchasing Chinese goods or equipment.  In addition, China 
will give the DRC $1.5m worth of office supplies and 
equipment to support the Congolese Foreign Ministry\'s 
operations, and up to 20,000 military uniforms.  Kapanga 
seemed puzzled himself as to what good 20,000 uniforms would 
be for a military current numbering roughly 300,000 soldiers, 
but said that the DRC had accepted the offer.  (Note:  China 
has a history of assisting the DRC Foreign Ministry, and 
China also built the Congolese Parliament in the 1970\'s.  End 
Note.)  Kapanga said that although the Congolese delegation 
did have a \"courtesy meeting\" with some Chinese military 
officials, no military training or assistance was offered nor 
sought, and there was no discussion with the Chinese of 
exploiting Congo\'s uranium, coltran or other mineral 
deposits.  Instead, China noted that possibility of building 
micro-dams to provide electricity to underserved areas of the 
Congo, using either hydro or thermo technology, as 
appropriate.  While enthusiastic over this prospect, Kapanga 
wryly noted that financing these projects, which the Chinese 
initially estimated at about $50 million, would be a 
challenge. 
 
North Korea Could Produce Roofing Tiles 
 
4. (C)  Kapanga emphasized how struck he was with the 
regimentation of North Korea (his driver, for instance, never 
spoke to him nor looked directly at him during the entire 
three-day stay, although he did quickly pocket the $50 
gratuity that Kapanga offered).  He spoke with some 
resentment of being forced to visit Kim\'s tomb, and of the 
delegation\'s being shown on Korean television bowing to the 
well-preserved icon.  He noted, with revulsion, that all the 
officials repeated constantly the \"party line\" extolling the 
brilliance of Kim and all their leaders, and virtually 
refused to engage in any real conversation.  He said the 
poverty and malnutrition visible on the trip into the city 
from the airport was in shocking contrast to the opulent 
marble palaces in which the government officials conducted 
business, and said the entire Congolese delegation was 
appalled by this contrast.  Although they met with two firms 
interested in producing roofing tiles in the Congo, Kapanga 
said he didn\'t think this would likely bear fruit, since 
neither North Korea nor the Congo has the financing necessary 
to found such a business.  Again, the Congolese met with a 
military delegation, but Kapanga said that there was no offer 
of military assistance, and particularly there was no 
discussion of accessing the DRC\'s uranium at Shinkolobwe mine 
in Katanga. 
 
5. (C)  Kapanga said that the Congolese likely will return to 
China for a second visit in March or April 2005 to explore 
more concrete ideas related to the line-of-credit offered by 
China, but stated categorically that they would not be going 
back to North Korea. 
 
Comment 
 
6. (C)  Visiting China at least has some logic, given that 
the Chinese do have financial capacity, political and 
economic links to the DRC, and a number of Chinese 
businessmen currently in the Congo, particularly in Katanga 
and Oriental Provinces.  However, North Korea remains a 
stretch and leaves us thinking, if not of uranium -- and we 
don\'t doubt Kapanga when he says the delegation didn\'t 
discuss uranium sales with the North Koreas -- at least of 
conventional arms.  The DRC could be seeking to upgrade its 
armaments to better defend itself -- although better arms in 
the hands of untrained and incompetent military is more 
frightening than effective.  In any event, there are things 
which just don\'t ring true about this visit; for instance, 
another Presidential advisor told the Ambassador that 
President Kabila had not been fully informed about this trip 
in advance, and hadn\'t even known that Kapanga would be going 
along.  We will try to get the Foreign Minister\'s perspective 
on the trip when he returns to the DRC from his current 
travels in early December.

SUBJECT: KATANGA POLITICAL UPDATE 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  President Kabila\'s PPRD party is the leading 
\"national\" contender in Katanga province, and benefits from 
local government control and preferential media access.  PPRD 
efforts are nonetheless somewhat in disarray, and face local 
players such as former governor Kyungu, whose tribalist 
approach runs counter to the PPRD\'s own efforts to build a 
multi-ethnic base.  Kabila has the advantage in Katanga over 
Kyungu and presidential rivals such as Jean-Pierre Bemba and 
Etienne Tshisekedi, but he will have to work harder in order 
to count the province a secure electoral win.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) Poloff visited Lubumbashi and Kalemie in DRC\'s Katanga 
province from Nov. 7-13 and met with local civil and military 
officials, diplomats, U.N. and international NGO workers, and 
members of civil society.  This is the second in a series of 
short cables on the trip. 
 
 
Governor, Vice-Governor Frustrated at Lack of Support? 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
3. (C) The recently-appointed provincial governor, Dr. Urbain 
Kisula Ngoy, met briefly with a delegation led by USAID 
country director on November 8.  He came across as relaxed 
and articulate, and did not employ local journalists to 
publicize the meeting.  According to one well-informed 
western source who frequently meets with the governor, Kisula 
is frustrated because Kinshasa has given him little support 
or resources with which to both reunify the province (the 
northernmost portion was and is still controlled by RCD-G 
appointed authorities) and to conduct an electoral campaign 
on behalf of President Kabila.  The same source said that one 
of the two vice-governors, Chikez Diemu (formerly 
secretary-general of President Kabila\'s political party, the 
 
SIPDIS 
PPRD), is also frustrated because the governor does not 
delegate well and runs the province in an amateurish way. 
(Comment:  Although Kisula is supposedly a Mai-Mai, as a 
pediatrician and former president of the provincial 
legislature he is anything but a bush fighter.  Both he and 
Chikez are PPRD men.  Their alleged frustration with 
Kinshasa\'s unwillingness to adequately support them rings 
true.  While most people accuse the ex-belligerent groups of 
using state funds to fund their respective political 
campaigns, we think the problem is more that those with 
access to such funds prefer to line their own pockets first, 
finance the party second.  End Comment.) 
 
 
Local PPRD in Some Disarray 
--------------------------- 
4. (C) Richard Muyej, head of the PPRD\'s party structure for 
Katanga, told poloff November 8 he spent most of the past two 
months in South Africa for medical reasons, and while he was 
gone, his colleagues did virtually nothing to advance the 
party\'s cause.  Muyej denied the rumor that the presidency 
had stripped PPRD secretary-general Vital Kamerhe\'s authority 
over party finances.  There is popular misperception, because 
there are in effect two parallel campaigns:  the first, 
involving the PPRD\'s formal party structure, targets the 
masses;  the second consists of individual presidential 
advisers, who are targeting local kingmakers.  Muyej 
explained President Kabila\'s failure to openly declare his 
candidacy and party affiliation as, first, a desire to remain 
above the political fray, and second, his status as a 
military officer which prevents him from running for civilian 
office.  In the next breath, however he admitted that Kabila 
\"will need to declare soon, because we\'re running out of 
time.\"  Finally, when asked about the issue of amnesty for 
individuals convicted in the much-criticized Laurent Kabila 
assassination trial, Muyej initially said it was not 
relevant, then added that locals at the village level in 
southern Katanga had asked him about it.  (Comment:  Poloff 
has heard previously that this is indeed an important issue 
to the Lunda, because several of the individuals convicted 
during the trial are fellow tribesmen.  Muyej, a Lunda 
himself, undoubtedly finds it awkward to defend the PPRD\'s 
position of denying amnesty to these individuals.  End 
Comment.) 
 
 
MLC, UDPS, RCD-Goma Absent? 
--------------------------- 
5. (C) Poloff heard relatively little about Jean-Pierre 
Bemba\'s MLC party (\"they\'re marginal here,\" according to one 
western diplomat) and saw no MLC banners, t-shirts, or other 
advertising, despite the fact that one of the two 
vice-governors and the military region commander are MLC men. 
 A MONUC source speculated that Bemba might try to forge a 
political alliance with Kyungu and air force commander Gen. 
John Numbi, both Luba Katanga tribesmen.  (Comment:  Bemba 
has probably had contact with Kyungu and Numbi--the latter 
perhaps more for common \"business\" interests--but we have 
heard nothing to indicate a political partnership.  A 
Bemba-Kyungu alliance would severely damage Bemba\'s chances 
of teaming up with Etienne Tshisekedi\'s UDPS party, whose 
mainly Luba Kasai supporters were on the receiving end of 
Kyungu\'s ethnic-cleansing campaign in the early 90s.  End 
Comment.) 
 
6. (C) The only mention of opposition figure Tshisekedi 
during poloff\'s visit was by a South African diplomat, who 
commented that the UDPS seriously considered but decided 
against creating an armed wing in 2002-3.  Poloff saw no UDPS 
or RCD-Goma signs, t-shirts or other publicity.  On November 
11 representatives from a smaller, UDPS-allied party 
complained to poloff that they lack campaign funds and fair 
access to public media, two areas where provincial 
authorities and the PPRD have a great advantage.  (Comment: 
Compared to Kinshasa, authorities in Katanga also maintain a 
much tighter grip on freedom of speech, as witnessed by the 
recent arrest and two months\' detention of pastor Albert 
Lukusa.  Lukusa publicly described the transitional 
government as infantile and suggested that Kabila and two of 
the vice-presidents are not of 100% Congolese parentage.  End 
Comment.) 
 
 
Other Local Players 
------------------- 
7. (C) Muyej and other observers confirmed that former 
governor Gabriel Kyungu wa Kamwanza, who lobbied hard to get 
his old job back but \"lost\" to Kisula, now says he is on 
Kabila\'s side--after threatening publicly in May to campaign 
against him.  (Note:  Kyungu, a Luba Katanga, leads a 
strictly Katangan party called the UNAFEC.  End Note.)  He 
\"has no scruples, no ideals,\" said Muyej, who knows from 
personal experience, having served as an adviser to Kyungu 
when the latter was governor during the early 1990s.  (Note: 
During this period, Kyungu presided over a massive 
ethnic-cleansing campaign, whereby militants from his 
political party--mostly of the Luba Katanga 
tribe--essentially drove out hundreds of thousands of 
Kasains, or \"non-native\" Katangans.  End Note.)  According to 
a MONUC source in Kalemie, Kyungu visited that town recently 
and is attempting to recruit Congolese into the youth wing of 
his political party, the UNAFEC.  Candidates must be under 
25, able to march three days without eating, and will be 
called \"Zulus\" (for men) and \"Amazons\" (women). 
 
8. (C) Moise Katumbi, younger brother of Raphael Soriano 
Katebe Katoto, is also in the PPRD camp, claimed Muyej, but 
the party \"needs to manage him carefully.\"  (Comment: 
Virtually all sides in the Congolese political arena have 
courted the wealthy Katebe Katoto, who never filled his 
senator\'s seat for the RCD-Goma and reportedly still fears 
arrest on murder charges if he sets foot in the DRC.  End 
Comment.)  According to western observers, Katumbi did not 
himself lobby to become governor, but instead supported 
Jean-Claude Muyambo, a prominent Lubumbashi-based lawyer. 
Muyambo, a former human-rights activist who is from one of 
the smaller tribes in Katanga, is president of \"Solidarite 
Katangaise,\" a local NGO that preaches unity and peace among 
Katangans.  (Comment:  The pro-Kabila newspaper \"L\'Avenir\" 
recently gave full-page coverage to a \"Solidarite Katangaise\" 
event in Lubumbashi, which was attended by pastor Ngoy 
Mulunda--an unofficial advisor to and emissary of Kabila. 
End Comment.)  Kyungu reportedly heads a similar, though less 
well-funded group, \"Fondation Katangaise,\" that advances his 
nativist, Katanga-for-the-real-Katangans view.  Another 
\"candidate\" for the governorship was Christian Mwando Simba, 
whose father Charles Mwando Simba currently chairs a key 
National Assembly committee and was governor of Kivu province 
under Mobutu.  One source explained that the Mwando Simbas 
are Tabwas, the same ethnicity as President Kabila\'s national 
security adviser, Guillaume Samba Kaputo--who also served as 
chief of staff to then-governor Charles Mwando Simba. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9. (C) Kabila certainly has the advantage in Katanga, but he 
cannot count the province as a secure electoral win. 
Although they adored his father, the Luba Katanga are less 
supportive of Joseph Kabila, and the president has done 
little so far to build an effective machine or patronage 
system with which to gain the support of other Katangans. 
The PPRD\'s current attempt to appeal to all ethnic groups in 
Katanga does not resonate with the dominant Luba Katanga 
tribe as well as Kyungu\'s nativist message does.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: TRANSPARENCY OF BUDGET/MILITARY SPENDING 
 
REF: STATE 239929 
 
 1.  Summary.  This message is in response to reftel and 
answers are keyed to those questions.  The GDRC is a post- 
conflict transitional government composed of all parties to 
the Global and Inclusive Accord signed in Sun City in 2002. 
The focus of the government is to finish the transition with 
elections slated to take place in June 2005.  The IMF is 
working with the GDRC to improve the accounting and budget 
process. Over the past three years they have made 
considerable progress in budget and expenditure procedures 
through the \"expense chain\" that accounts for disbursements 
and codes them to budget items.  End summary. 
 
2.  (Part A) General Overview of Auditing Procedures 
(1)  Military expenditures are audited internally. 
(2)  Military finance officers conduct the audits. 
(3)  Audits are presented to the Minister of Defense and the 
President. 
(4)  Both the Minister of Defense and the President hold the 
rank of Major General. 
(5)  Audits are not required on an annual basis. 
(6)  There has been no specific legislation passed by the 
transitional government but, as noted above, internal audits 
are conducted as a matter of policy. 
 
The GDRC is transitional in nature, and is working to resolve 
years of internal and external conflicts.  The government\'s 
lack of technical capacity is being addressed in cooperation 
with the IMF. Parliament is increasing its oversight of the 
budgetary process, and has authority to review audits. 
 
There is a lack of breakdown in salary payments to the 
military due to the absence of a centralized disbursement 
structure.  The international community is working with the 
GDRC to integrate former rebel groups into the armed forces, 
demobilize large numbers of them, and conduct a census to 
precisely budget for salary and related expenses.  Parallel 
to this, the Central Bank is working to set up offices 
throughout the country and to set up an electronic payroll 
system for the civil service as well as military. Most 
deficiencies in the present system are a result of capacity 
constraints. The IMF reported on November 23 at the 
conclusion of its November 9-23 mission that the GDRC has 
made very good progress on tracking expenditures, including 
with the military. 
 
3.  (Part B) The Military Budget and On-budget and Off-budget 
Revenues and Expenses 
(1)  The national police are under the Minister of the 
Interior, not the Minister of Defense.  Other security 
services are under the Office of the President. 
(2)  Both the GDRC and the IMF noted military 
over-expenditure in 2004; this was a direct result of 
unanticipated expenses incurred in June 2004 when the 
military had to respond to the seizure of Bukavu (the capital 
of South Kivu) by a renegade militia group.  Post is not 
aware of significant off-budget military receipts. 
 
4.  (Part C)  The Military Component of the National Budget 
 
(1)  With pressure from donors under the HIPC program and 
IMF\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy, the GDRC has made progress 
in increasing health and education spending.  Military 
expenditures are still larger.  Military spending is 
estimated to be 15 percent of the budget.  The GDRC is 
unlikely to spend significantly more on health and education 
until conflicts are resolved and the transition is completed. 
(2)  The budget debate begins in the Council of Ministers 
where 36 different Ministries vie for funding with four 
vice-presidents and the President\'s office.  As half the 
budget is financed by external sources, donors also weigh in 
on the debate.  The draft budget is then debated by the two 
chambers of the Parliament.  These actors were all appointed 
under the Global Accord; none has a majority in any body, so 
debate is lively.

SUBJECT: RUBERWA ENGAGES IN QUIET DIPLOMACY ON BANYAMULENGE 
ISSUE 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.4 b/d. 
 
 1. (C)  PolCouns spoke November 20 with Muller Ruhimbika, a 
Banyamulenge leader, and November 22 with Jean-Marie Emungu, 
VP Azarias Ruberwa\'s chief-of-staff, about Ruberwa\'s quick 
trip to eastern Congo November 18-20.  Accompanied by General 
Masunzu (who commands Banyamulenge troops fiercely opposed to 
Rwanda), Ruberwa visited Uvira and Minembwe and spoke to the 
Banyamulenge communities there. According to Muller, Ruberwa 
found the Banyamulenge in Minembwe to be in good spirits, but 
cautioned them to treat their non-Banyamulenge (minority) 
neighbors \"well and kindly,\" so that in places like Uvira and 
Bukavu, the Banyamulenge would be treated well by other 
Congolese (the majority).  Emungu said that Ruberwa then 
joined North Kivu Governor Serufuli for a visit to the Masisi 
Plain, where there has consistently been tension in recent 
months among Mai Mai, Interhamwe, displaced Banyamulenge, and 
Congolese military.  Emungu said that Ruberwa urged the 
Banyamulenge to return to South Kivu (most of the 
Banyamulenge IDPs in Masisi fled there in time from areas 
near Bukavu when that city came under attack), and 
specifically suggested that they go to Minembwe, where they 
will be safe. 
 
2. (C)  Comment:  Unhindered by the normal spate of negative 
publicity surrounding any of his attempts to visit eastern 
Congo, Ruberwa seems to have been quietly effective.  Monuc 
Bukavu told PolCouns November 23 there is a movement of 
Banyamulenge IDPs back into South Kivu, although it is not 
clear yet whether their destination might be Minembwe.  The 
sole potential problem with this effort is that it continues 
the trend toward \"Banyamulenge-land\" within South Kivu, a 
zone protected by Masunzu and his men, which ultimately could 
set up conflict between Masunzu and other FADRC elements.  In 
the meantime, however, Minembwe certainly could be a 
safehaven destination for returning urban Banyamulenge from 
Bukavu and Uvira who find themselves homeless and unwelcome 
in those cities.  Returning, even temporarily, to the High 
Plains could possibly be one way to resolve the current 
pressures by refugees in Cyangagu (Rwanda) who wish to return 
to the DRC but currently are prohibited from doing so, at 
least to Bukavu.  Ruberwa has now begun a European trip 
during which he will visit London, Paris and Brussels and 
will, among other matters, discuss the Banyamulenge situation 
in eastern Congo.  Likewise, Muller and his compatriot Enock 
(a Parliamentarian) will be in the U.S. for a visit, 
beginning with a conference in Maine sponsored by diaspora 
Banyamulenge.  Muller\'s return from exile in France seems to 
have launched an effort by the Banyamulenge to reach out to 
the international community to explain their situation and 
request assistance.

SUBJECT: CORRUPTION CHARGES COULD OUST SOME MINISTERS 
 
 
Classified By: Poloff Edward Bestic for Reasons 1.5 B and D 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Parliament is preparing to vote, November 
25 or 26, on a report identifying six ministers and President 
Kabila\'s Chief of Staff as involved in corruption.  If the 
investigating committee\'s report is accepted by the 
Parliamentary plenary session, the ministers will be 
dismissed, and President Kabila likely will also relief his 
Chief of Staff.  Ousting the six ministers could spark a 
wider cabinet shuffle, for which at least some of the 
components, particularly the RCD, seem prepared. If these 
individuals do lose their jobs--an outcome that is possible 
but not at all certain--it would be a positive development, 
because it will set a precedent in terms of good governance 
and parliamentary oversight.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Kabila Threatens Action 
----------------------- 
2. (U) Amidst much media fanfare, National Assembly president 
Olivier Kamitatu delivered to President Joseph Kabila on Nov. 
23 the findings of a parliamentary investigation of official 
corruption.  (Note:  Kamitatu is also secretary-general of 
Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s Congo Liberation Movement (MLC).  End 
Note.)  Kabila\'s spokesman, Kudura Kasongo, issued a press 
statement the same day confirming receipt of the report and 
promising that the president would \"draw conclusions\" from 
it, \"in accordance with the law.\"  The statement reminded 
readers that Kabila wrote to parliament on May 19 about the 
problem of official corruption and warned at that time that 
anyone who broke the law would be brought to justice. 
Meanwhile, the Nov. 24 headline of pro-Kabila daily 
\"L\'Avenir\" read, \"Joseph Kabila Without Pity - Corrupt 
Ministers and Officials to Prison.\" 
 
Parliament to Vote 
------------------ 
3. (C) Kamitatu told the Ambassador at a dinner November 23 
that he plans to present the report at a plenary of the 
National Assembly commission on Nov. 26, and is working to 
arrange a straight yes-or-no vote on its findings and 
recommendations.  Senior parliamentary figures already 
expressed their support for the document in closed session, 
but Kamitatu is continuing to lobby behind the scenes because 
the final outcome is still unclear.  (Note:  Kamitatu\'s 
cabinet director told poloff the plenary could take place 
Nov. 25.  End Note.) 
 
The Lineup 
---------- 
4. (C) Thomas Luhaka, MLC spokesman and leader of its 
parliamentary group, told poloff Nov. 24 that the report 
cites senior officials from all the major factions.  The list 
includes:  from Kabila\'s PPRD, presidency chief of staff 
Evariste Boshab and energy minister Kalema Lusona;  from the 
MLC, public works minister Jose Endundo;  from the RCD-G, 
higher education minister Joseph Mudumbi (and not defense 
minister Jean-Pierre Ondekane, a name cited in the press); 
from the RCD-N, foreign trade minister Roger Lumbala;  and 
from the unarmed political opposition, mines minister Eugene 
Diomi and transport minister Joseph Olengankhoy.  Luhaka said 
the allegations against Endundo are not as serious as the 
others and Bemba wants the National Assembly to \"distinguish\" 
between individuals and hold public hearings, but Kamitatu 
fears that if the MLC defends Endundo, the other factions 
will follow suit and stick up for their own ministers. Luhaka 
said one of the cases in the report involves a $40m debt owed 
to SNEL, the electricity parastatal, by the government of 
Congo-Brazzaville.  According to Luhaka, one thing the report 
does not mention is that a top SNEL official fingered Kabila 
himself, as well as his sister Janet, Congo-B President 
Sassou Nguessou, and Sassou\'s cousin in this scam, whereby 
Congo-B paid less than the full amount and Kabila family 
members in turn received a handsome payment for themselves. 
Luhaka understands his own chief, Bemba, may also be 
implicated in this deal, further complicating matters. 
 
RCD-G Eager to Fire its Own 
--------------------------- 
5. (C) South Kivu vice-governor Thomas Nziratimana of the 
RCD-G told poloff Nov. 23 that RCD-G leader Ruberwa and his 
supporters have wanted to axe Mudumbi and Ondekane for 
months, because they \"betrayed\" the RCD-G by actively 
opposing Ruberwa\'s decision to boycott the transitional 
government in August.  (Note:  This came days after the Aug. 
13 massacre of Congolese refugees in Burundi.  End Note.) 
Between Ruberwa\'s indecision and the RCD-G\'s relative 
weakness, the party did not remove the two immediately, but 
the taint of corruption provides a handy pretext for removing 
them that simultaneously limits Ondekane\'s and Mudumbi\'s 
chances of taking supporters with them.  Adolphe Onusumba, a 
former president of the RCD-G and currently vice-president of 
the National Assembly, is the leading candidate to replace 
Ondekane.  Nziratimana commented wryly that Onusumba is eager 
to get the job, not because he feels strongly about 
Ondekane\'s incompetence but rather as a chance to grab money 
and power. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (C) Very few public figures in the DRC are blameless when 
it comes to questions of corruption. In that sense, the 
investigative report may be seen as more a pretext than a 
real reason for sacking ministers.  Kabila has reportedly 
been looking to replace Boshab for some time, possibly with 
former information minister Kikaya Bin Karubi.  Likewise, the 
RCD-G has been itching to remove some of its own ministers 
for months.  If the ministers identified as corrupt are 
fired--an outcome that is possible but not at all certain--it 
would be a positive development, however, because it sets a 
useful precedent in terms of good governance and 
parliamentary oversight.  END COMMENT.

1. (C)  PolCouns spoke November 25 with Monuc Goma Head of 
Office, and with a Monuc political officer in Kinshasa, to 
get an update on Monuc\'s investigation of the rocket attack 
into Rwanda, allegedly by the FDLR.  Both Monuc sources said 
that their initial investigation indicated that rather than 
FDLR, the attack may have been perpetrated by a renegade Mai 
Mai leader named Jackson Kasaveka.  (Ambassador had been told 
the same thing at a mini-CIAT meeting November 24.) 
Jackson\'s group operates in the southern part of North Kivu, 
but his is one of three Mai Mai groups known to respond to 
Mbusa Nyamwisi, who controls northern North Kivu.  Jackson\'s 
Mai Mai are part of those who have been sporadically fighting 
with ex-ANC elements in the Walikale/Masisi areas of North 
Kivu for the last few months.  (Nyamwisi\'s other two Mai Mai 
groups both operate in his zone of control, the Grand North, 
loosely in the area around Lake Albert.) 
 
2. (C)  Noel Membusi, head of the NGO International Crisis 
Group, told PolCouns November 26 that during his November 
22-25 visit to Beni and Butembu he observed new weaponry 
among the Mai Mai in Butembu. He also reported that 
businessmen and some FARDC military officers are discussing 
Nyamwisi\'s improved ties to Uganda, which supposedly include 
several recent deliveries of weapons, including to Jackson\'s 
group. 
 
3. (C)  Comment:  Nyamwisi certainly has been increasingly 
disgruntled with Kinshasa over the last few months, 
particularly as Kinshasa has apparently begun improving its 
contacts with Nyamwisi\'s rival, Eugene Serufuli.  Nyamwisi 
has made no secret of his unhappiness with having been given 
the minor regional affairs portfolio instead of the much more 
prestigious foreign minister position to which he had 
aspired.  We doubt, however, that Nyamwisi would have ordered 
Jackson to fire on Rwandan territory, although it is 
certainly possible that Jackson, a real wildcard, might have 
taken such an action on his own, possibly to test one of his 
new pieces of equipment.

SUBJECT: CONGOLESE MILITARY PREPARING CONTINGENCY PLANS TO 
COUNTER RWANDAN INVASION 
 
 
Classified By: PolCouns MSanderson, reasons 1.4 b/d. 
 
 1. (C)  PolCouns met November 24, and spoke telephonically 
November 25, with Air Force Commander John Numbi.  Numbi said 
November 24 that in a meeting at the Presidency it had been 
decided that the army would immediately redeploy three 
battalions of Congolese troops (about 1,500 men) to the 
DRC-Rwandan border area between South and North Kivu to 
respond, if necessary, to a Rwandan incursion.  He said that, 
although the Congolese are \"tired of war, we will defend 
ourselves if necessary.\" 
 
2. (C) By the following afternoon Congolese military thinking 
evidently had evolved.  Numbi called PolCouns en route to a 
meeting of the Maison Militaire (effectively the commanding 
body of the military), to say that the Congolese believe 
that, thanks to the concerted diplomatic efforts underway, 
Rwanda is unlikely to invade Congo \"in the next few days.\" 
However, he added that once the eyes of the world turn away 
from the border zone -- as they soon will, he insisted -- 
Rwanda likely will pursue its goal.  Therefore the Maison 
Militaire has been tasked to prepare a contingency plan to 
defend both Kivus, since it is \"clear\" to the Congolese 
military that the Rwandan objectives lie within both 
provinces.  He said that, as part of that plan, the personnel 
of the three battalions will be swapped out, so that better 
trained and (by implication) more trustworthy troops will be 
moved into the front-line positions.  (Note:  As part of the 
now months-old massive military deployment to the eastern 
Congo, Kinshasa dispatched GSSP to positions in both Kindu 
and Kisangani -- Numbi could be referring to a plan to move 
some or all of these elements to the border.  End Note.) 
Numbi insisted the Congo has no intention of attacking 
Rwanda, despite, he said, some statements indicating the high 
degree of anger and frustration sparked by this latest round 
of Rwandan aggression. 
 
3. (C)  Comment:  Numbi did not, despite repeated questions 
from PolCouns, indicate that either Congolese politicians or 
military are currently considering any new plan to actively 
address the FDLR problem.  Monuc\'s evaluation, based on its 
abortive joint effort with FARDC in Wulungu (septel), is that 
the Congolese military is completely incapable of dealing 
with the FDLR, largely due to its inability to logistically 
sustain operations.  This is no surprise, but leaves the onus 
on the international community, therefore, to try to devise a 
viable plan for dealing with the FDLR.  Doing so clearly is 
one fundamental element to achieving a lasting peace between 
Rwanda and the DRC, and therefore within the region as a 
whole.

SUBJECT: CONSULTATIVE GROUP PLEDGES $5.7 BILLION FOR DRC 
 
1.  Summary.   The Paris Club Consultative Group met in 
Kinshasa November 11-12 to review the DRC\'s economic 
transition and recovery program (Minimum Partnership Program 
for Transition and Recovery - MPPTR), and to pledge support 
for the country\'s development needs over the next 3-4 years. 
Of a total of $6.9 billion requested by the GDRC, donors 
pledged $5.7 billion.  With an additional $1 billion already 
invested in current projects, World Bank sources indicate 
that almost all of the GDRC\'s MPPTR needs will be funded. 
End summary. 
 
2.  The GDRC, after consultation with the World Bank and the 
IMF, formally presented a $6.9 billion program for economic 
development over the next 3-4 years.  It asked donors in the 
Consultative Group to fund 16 key areas:  macroeconomic 
management ($1.24 billion); transport ($919 million); health 
($651 million); water ($621 million); education ($620 
million); energy ($598 million); urban development ($409 
million); Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration and 
Security Sector Reform ($325 million); elections ($285 
million); agriculture ($258 million); productive sectors 
($255 million); HIV/AIDS ($250 million); governance ($181 
million); social and humanitarian ($170 million); environment 
($50 million); and scientific research ($37 million).  The 
government said it intends to supplement all international 
assistance received with a 10% contribution of its own. 
 
3.  Opening the meeting on November 11, President Kabila 
asked donors to \"take into account the government\'s efforts\" 
on the macroeconomic front, highlighting achievements in 
reducing inflation, increasing GDP growth, and stabilizing 
the monetary exchange rate.  The President made a plea for 
donor pledges to be translated into rapid disbursements so 
that the government can get on with its program of rebuilding 
infrastructure and revamping the economy. 
 
4.  Kabila\'s positive message on the economy was reinforced 
by a generally upbeat assessment from an IMF mission in 
Kinshasa at the same time (septel).  Donors responded 
favorably, and the level of pledges was surprisingly high. 
As Emmanuel Mbi, outgoing Director of Operations for Central 
Africa at the World Bank, subsequently pointed out, it is 
very unusual to see such a large-scale program to be fully 
funded at a donor\'s meeting. 
 
5.  The GDRC was likewise satisfied with the outcome. 
Minister of Plan Alexis Thambwe said the government was \"very 
pleasantly surprised by our partners\" who had clearly 
signaled they \"believe in our country.\"  The one sour note 
came from Finance Minister Andre Philippe Futa who complained 
that donors were only funneling 40% of their assistance 
directly through the GDRC. 
 
6.  USAID/DRC Mission Director provided opening and pledging 
statements.  He highlighted USG commitment to support a 
successful transition in the DRC and the achievements made by 
the DRC over the past several years.  He noted, however, that 
positive achievements are tempered by continued political 
instability and conflict.  He reported the USG provided more 
than $110 million to support development and humanitarian 
assistance programs in the DRC in FY04.  The USG plans to 
continue its important development activities in the areas of 
health, civil society building, human rights, gender 
violence, conflict resolution, agriculture and livelihoods 
promotion, basic education, environment and the reintegration 
of ex-combatants.  The USG will also continue to support 
humanitarian efforts, particularly in eastern DRC. 
 
7.  Comment:  The Consultative Group meeting has to be seen 
as a success by the GDRC.   While donors reiterated ongoing 
concerns about important aspects of the GDRC\'s economic 
performance and management, their pledges are a clear 
indication of strong support for the Transition and for the 
efforts made thus far to rebuild a war-ravaged economy.  End 
summary.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  In the wake of a parliamentary report on 
corruption, President Kabila on November 25 suspended six 
ministers while the Minister of Porftolio minister suspended 
the managers of ten state-owned enterprises.  In our view, 
this action is an attempt to seize the moral high ground 
before a scheduled parliamentary vote on the issue November 
26.  Vice President Bemba\'s own party issued a statement 
crediting Bemba with the anti-corruption drive, yet asking 
that the accused (one of whom is in the MLC) be allowed to 
defend themselves.  Meanwhile, the CIAT called on the 
Congolese to continue negotiating the subject of dividing up 
state-owned enterprises, and said SOE managers should be 
professional and apolitical -- the latter point likely to be 
seen as pro-Kabila.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Kabila Suspends Ministers 
------------------------- 
2. (U) President Kabila suspended on November 25 six 
ministers who were cited in a recent parliamentary report on 
corruption (reftel A).  The six mentioned in the presidential 
communique include Minister of Mines Eugene Diomi (political 
opposition), Minister of Energy Kalema Lusona (Kabila\'s 
party, the PPRD), Minister of Public Works Jose Endundo (from 
Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba\'s party, the MLC), Minister 
of Transport Joseph Olengankhoy (political opposition), 
Minister of Foreign Trade Roger Lumbala (RCD-N), and Minister 
of Higher Education Joseph Mudumbi (RCD-Goma).  The same day, 
Minister of Portfolio Celestin Vunabandi also suspended the 
executives of ten state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including 
the national power, maritime transport, roads and 
hydrocarbons companies.  (Note:  CEEC, the 
diamond-certification authority, was not among these.  End 
Note.) 
 
3. (C) According to a top aide to National Assembly President 
Olivier Kamitatu, the National Assembly still plans to meet 
in plenary on November 26 to vote on its commission\'s report. 
 Kamitatu is under great pressure from those cited in the 
document, the aide said. 
 
4. (U) Vice President Bemba\'s MLC issued a statement on 
November 25, which praised the parliamentary commission\'s 
work and gave Bemba the credit for leading the fight for good 
governance.  The MLC also asked the GDRC and commission to 
give those accused in the report a chance to explain 
themselves. 
 
 
CIAT Position on State-Owned Enterprises 
---------------------------------------- 
5. (U) The 17 ambassadors making up the International 
Committee to Support the Transition (CIAT) issued their own 
communique on November 25 on the subject of dividing up 
state-owned enterprises.  This was a follow-up to CIAT\'s 
initial communique of October 14 in response to Vice 
President Bembas\'s call for the CIAT to arbitrate his 
long-standing dispute with the presidency over control of the 
Congolese parastatals (reftel B).  The CIAT called on 
President Kabila and his four vice presidents to discuss the 
matter among themselves and put it on the agenda for their 
next meeting with the CIAT.  The CIAT statement also 
emphasized several principles, including:  the parties should 
continue to negotiate the matter;  the management of SOEs 
should be professional and apolitical;  the parties must not 
use SOEs to finance electoral campaigns; any solution must 
conform to provisions set by the World Bank and the IMF; 
there must be total transparency as called for by the 
Congolese public; and strong support for Parliament\'s current 
efforts to ensure transparency.  (Note:  Text of the

COMMENT 
------- 
6. (C) Kabila\'s action, coming just before the National 
Assembly\'s own vote, is a belated attempt to seize the moral 
high ground on this issue.  The MLC\'s own statement hints at 
Bemba\'s dilemma -- the desire to defend Endundo, yet also 
present a \"clean\" public image.  The CIAT statement may be 
interpreted by some here as a minor defeat for Bemba and 
support for Kabila, reflecting the expressed preference to 
establish a new commission to appoint apolitical managers. 
Prevailing CIAT sentiment which we fully supported, however, 
was to convey a message that the politically-based 
traditional \"spoils\" treatment of parastatals should come to 
an end.  The timing of the communique was deliberately set to 
coincide with the public action suspending the ministers and 
SOE executives, seeking to make it more difficult for 
political leaders so inclined to defend publicly the old 
approach.  End comment.

 1. (C)  Senior Presidential Advisor Augustin Katumba called 
PolCouns November 27 to provide a readout of the meeting 
between Presidents Kabila and Kagame, facilitated by 
President Obasanjo.  Largely agreeing in substance with 
Rwandan readout (reftel), Katumba mentioned Kagame\'s proposal 
to either dispatch Rwandan troops directly to deal with the 
situation, or to have Rwandan troops play some sort of role 
in a joint mission with Congolese military.  The tone in 
which the Ouagadougou meeting was portrayed by Katumba was 
striking, however.  Katumba said Kagame had come to the 
meeting with his mind already made up that Rwanda would 
invade the Congo; that Kagame was \"bullying,\" \"patronizing\" 
and disrespectful to Kabila; that Kagame was not open to 
proposals from Kabila involving MONUC operations -- and 
questioned rhetorically how anyone could have expected a 
positive outcome.  Katumba said the meeting ended 
inconclusively, with Kagame saying he would consult other 
international partners but that a solution needed to be found 
quickly.  Katumba\'s closing remark was that if the matter was 
so urgent, Rwanda should have dealt directly with eliminating 
the \"scourge\" of the FDLR when it was in \"sole charge\" of the 
eastern part of the Congo. 
 
2. (C)  Comment:  Katumba\'s readout, and especially the tone 
in which it was conveyed, exemplify the problem with the 
hardliners to which Kabila referred.  Katumba, and others 
like him, could indeed topple the transition - and possibly 
plot against Kabila himself - should Kabila be seen to be 
capitulating to the Rwandans, which is how a cooperative 
effort would be viewed.  We believe a South African military 
effort, however, whether directly or in some sort of 
cooperation with MONUC and the Congolese, would be much more 
palatable, if it indeed is feasible.

SUBJECT: KABILA DISCUSSES EASTERN SITUATION WITH FOREIGN 
AMBASSADORS 
 
Classified By Ambassador Roger Meece.  Reason 1.4 (b/d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: President Kabila held a November 29 
discussion with Ambassadors from the UNSC Perm 5 countries, 
Belgium, South Africa, Angola, and Nigeria, and UN SRSG 
Swing.  While speaking in measured tones, Kabila made clear 
his frustration with Rwandan President Kagame, and in essence 
Kabila accused Kagame of seeking to wreck entirely the DRC,s 
transition. Kabila and close advisors outlined steps being 
taken by the GDRC to address the ex-FAR/Interahamwe threat, 
and appealed for united international community support for 
use of the Joint Verification Mechanism (JVM), tripartite 
process, and other political and diplomatic means to address 
regional problems.  Kabila reported Rwandan and Congolese 
military chiefs should be meeting on the border this week. 
He also noted, however, that the government is deploying 
FARDC brigades to North Kivu to address threats both from 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe as well as from Rwanda.  In related 
activity, Nigerian President Obasanjo is coming to Kinshasa 
Dec 6., and MONUC is seeking to begin JVM operations this 
week.  A Joint Verification Commission meeting has been 
proposed for December 9 in Kinshasa.  The South African 
Ambassador suggested that Mbeki is exploring how SADC may be 
involved in solutions as well.  Other items discussed during 
the meeting will be reported septel.  End summary. 
 
Kabila Discusses the East 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Following his return to Kinshasa over the weekend from 
the Ouagadougou Francophonie summit, President Kabila 
convened the morning of November 29 what he characterized as 
an informal discussion with the Ambassadors of the UNSC Perm 
5 members, Belgium, South Africa, Angola, and Nigeria, plus 
UN SRSG Bill Swing.  Kabila was accompanied by Chief of Staff 
Boshab, Special Advisor Kaputo, Ambassador-at-Large Okitundu, 
Diplomatic Advisor Kapanaga, and his spokesperson. 
 
3. (C) Kabila opened by emphasizing his concern over the 
situation in the east, and specifically the threat of renewed 
invasion by Rwandan forces.  He noted that in recent weeks, 
the DRC and Rwanda had been parties to signature of the Joint 
Verification Mechanism (JVM) agreement and the 
U.S.-facilitated Tripartite Agreement, and had taken part in 
the Dar es Salaam summit and separate meetings with the 
visiting UNSC.  He and Rwandan President Kagama met in Dar. 
Only a short time after all of this, Kagame made new threats 
to send his forces across the DRC border, a possibility never 
mentioned in their meeting only a few days before.  Kabila 
said he found the timing strange, and later added that even 
though \"some\" do not believe Rwanda already has troops inside 
the DRC, in fact they do.  He asserted Kagame,s public 
threat was only a justification of a course of action already 
launched.  Kabila also noted that the new Rwandan threat 
occurred while 8th Military District Commander Obed is 
\"absent\" from the area. 
 
Meeting in Ouagadougou, Threats, Plans 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (C) Kabila reported that he had met again with Kagame in 
Ouagadougou.  He said that Kagame had asked \"officially\" for 
Rwandan troops to re-enter the DRC, possibly with 2-3 
brigades operating with the Congolese to disarm 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe forces in the region.  Kabila reported he 
deemed the proposal \"inadmissible\" as the Congolese people 
would simply not accept the renewed acknowledged presence of 
Rwandan troops on Congolese soil. Indeed, it would risk a 
potentially violent public reaction in various parts of the 
country. 
 
5. (C) Kabila noted his own intent to deal with the 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe, and had Special Advisor Kaputo expand. 
Kaputo ran through a brief recent history of the JVM and 
Tripartite processes, and said the GDRC had developed a plan 
to deal with the ex-FAR/Interahamwe within the time frame 
described in the Tripartite Agreement.  Specifically, actions 
were being taken to talk with Mai Mai and other local leaders 
to locate and identify ex-FAR/Interahamwe forces and 
specifically leaders.  In the meantime, brigades are to be 
trained at Kitona base within the next three months for 
deployment to use against those elements who resist voluntary 
disarmament and repatriation (DDRRR).  Also during this time, 
it is important for Rwanda to renew efforts in Rwanda to 
encourage return. 
 
6. (C) Given the current situation, Kaputo said that as an 
interim measure the government is undertaking an \"interim\" 
deployment of additional forces to North Kivu.  Kabila later 
added that just as significant new forces had earlier been 
sent to South Kivu in response to the destabilization threat 
posed by \"dissident\" Generals Nkunda and Mutebusi, 
significant new forces will be sent to North Kivu now to 
address the threat from both the ex-FAR/Interahamwe and from 
Rwanda across the border.  Kabila also reported that the 
Congolese and Rwandan military chiefs are to meet this week 
on the border, either on the border bridge near Bukavu, or in 
the \"no-man\'s land\" border area near Goma. 
 
Ambassadorial Responses 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) SRSG Swing led the responses from the foreign 
Ambassadors with three recommendations.  First, JVM 
operations in North Kivu should start immediately using 
personnel already stationed in Goma and Gisenyi.  He 
indicated that the final formal document, a concept of 
operations, had already been signed by GDRC 
Ambassador-at-Large Ghonda and was awaiting signature in 
Kigali by Great Lakes Special Envoy Sezibera.  (Note: MONUC 
DDR Chief told DCM and PolCouns later on Nov. 29 that 
Sezibera did indeed sign the JVM concept of operations 
today.)  Secondly, Swing said that he obtained agreement from 
both Kigali and Kinshasa to hold a meeting of the Joint 
Verification Commission on December 9 in Kinshasa, although 
it would be chaired by current incumbent Rwanda.  Swing 
noted, however, that Rwandan FM Murigande has recently 
commented that he did not see the need to hold the meeting 
before January.  Swing asserted he believes it now more 
important than ever to hold the meeting quickly.  Thirdly, 
Swing encouraged the Tripartite mechanism to be fully 
utilized for dialogue among the respective regional players. 
 
8. (C) Other Ambassadorial interventions fully supported the 
need to start immediately JVM operations, to make use of the 
Tripartite, and to avoid recourse to military actions.  While 
endorsing these sentiments, I also noted the long-standing 
seemingly intractable nature of the problem represented by 
Hutu extremist forces.  In addition to whatever problem they 
pose to Rwanda, they certainly threaten the security of 
Congolese in the east and general stability as well, but a 
solution has been hard to find.  While Congolese efforts to 
neutralize these forces are needed and welcome, I encouraged 
consideration of other potential offers that may be made by 
other countries (comment: thinking specifically of South 
Africa) which could be useful in this regard.  The French 
Ambassador pointed out the problem of the \"expenditure chain\" 
which has delayed many issues in the GDRC, including military 
integration and training, in reference to the planned 
training in Kitona.  (Comment: This is an allusion to control 
by Vice President Bemba of key portfolios, and the delays and 
political problems arising from the divided 
responsibilities.)  The UK Ambassador underscored the 
importance of concrete results in the east.  The Belgian 
Ambassador emphasized the importance of Rwandan actions to 
create an environment conducive to the return of Rwanda Hutu 
combatants in the DRC, commenting that Brussels does not 
believe the signals to-date \"have been sufficiently clear\". 
 
9. (C) The South African Ambassador made an allusion to my 
remarks, but did not describe any specific offers or ideas 
that President Mbeki may have made to Kabila in recent 
contacts.  He did say that Mbeki is exploring how SADC may be 
involved and helpful to a solution. 
 
10. (C) The Nigerian Ambassador reported that President 
Obasanjo will be arriving in Kinshasa on December 5 or 6 in 
follow-up to his participation in the Ouagadougou meeting. 
He reportedly plans to continue on to Kigali following his 
Kinshasa stop. 
 
 
Presidential Wrap-Up 
-------------------------- 
 
11. (C) In his final summary, Kabila said that he has been 
trying to determine what the Rwandans really want.  While the 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe are a continuing problem, he does not 
believe they represent any longer a threat to fundamental GOR 
stability.  He opined that there may be three basic 
motivations.  Rwanda retains strong coltan mining and other 
commercial interests in North Kivu, and they presumably want 
to preserve them. Secondly, they may wish to derail the DRC 
transition process.  Surely they are aware that a renewed 
acknowledged large-scale troop presence in the DRC could set 
off major public violent demonstrations that could wreck the 
fragile transition process.  Thirdly, he wondered if in fact 
the Rwandans want the hard-line core of remaining Hutu 
extremists back.  A new military operation, or even threatof 
a military operation, acts as a motivator to stay away. 
Kabila also speculated about a DRC threat to enter Rwanda, 
for example to seize General Mutebusi or his people.  Would 
this be regarded in the same way? 
 
12. (C) Kabila also expressed frustration with meetings and 
declarations.  Kabila said he refused a Belgian request in 
Ouagadougou for a joint declaration with Kagame, adding that 
the Congolese people have seen too many statements that seem 
to mean nothing (comment: a clear allusion to the JVM and 
tripartite accords, and the Dar es Salaam regional 
conference).  Kabila noted again his intention to deploy new 
troops to North Kivu to address both threats, from the 
ex-FAR/Interahamwe and from Rwanda.  He appealed for support 
for these deployments, and for general international 
community support for political and diplomatic efforts to 
avoid renewed general warfare in the area. 
 
Comment 
------------ 
 
13. (C)  Kabila spoke in measured tones throughout the 
meeting, but clearly projected a sense of frustration and 
resentment over the Rwandan threat.  It is unclear which 
troops are to be involved in the Kitona training plan, but 
this may be linked to the Angolan government effort to train 
significant numbers of troops in Kitona, primarily 
Presidential GSSP.  The GGSP is widely viewed as the only 
potential FARDC force capable of undertaking any kind of 
sustained offensive military operations.  Kabila,s reference 
to 8th Military District Commander Obed,s \"absence\" from 
Goma likely reflects Kabila,s intent to block Obed,s return 
permanently.  Obed has been largely viewed in the Presidency 
as unresponsive to Kinshasa, and likely working in 
cooperation with Kigali.  Obed,s removal, much less a new 
deployment of supposedly Kinshasa-controlled troops into 
North Kivu, could certainly effect a major change in the 
overall balance of forces and influence in the province. 
This, along with the recent reported failure of the joint 
FARDC/MONUC operation against ex-FAR/Interahamwe forces in 
North Kivu due to the lack of FARDC logistical support 
capability, may indeed not be unrelated to the timing of the 
current threat and general situation.  As reflected in our 
reporting, we have been aware for some weeks of significant 
new renewed political maneuvering in North Kivu by one or 
more key players, including the Kinshasa government, 
RCD-Goma, and North Kivu Governor Serufuli.  We may be 
witnessing the denouement. 
 
14. (C) Comment continued: Whatever the causes, the 
overriding priority from our perspective at this point must 
be the avoidance of renewed large-scale fighting that could 
engulf the region in a renewed period of warfare.  Such a 
development would certainly bring crashing down the overall 
DRC transition as well.  Insofar as a solution to neutralize 
the remaining Hutu extremist forces can be identified, 
possibly with South African or other foreign troops to help 
take on the task, so much the better to eliminate the 
long-stated GOR major concern, as well as an ongoing threat 
to the security of all in the region.  Clearly, we should 
also use our efforts to support the range of political 
efforts underway, including the JVM and tripartite, and what 
we hope will be coordinated efforts by Obasanjo and Mbeki. 
End comment.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROGER MEECE.  REASON 1.4 (b/d) 
 
1. (C) President Kabila met November 29 with the Ambassadors 
from UNSC Perm 5 countries, Belgium, South Africa, Angola, 
and Nigeria, plus UN SRSG Bill Swing primarily to discuss the 
situation in eastern DRC, as reported ref A.  After the 
discussion, Kabila also noted current debates  regarding 
designation of executives to run key state-owned companies, 
and leadership of security services, including the 
immigration service, (DGM) and the DRC National Intelligence 
Agency (ANR).  In both cases, there are major political 
fights underway among the parties and groups that form the 
transitional government. 
 
2. (C) Starting with the issue of the state companies, Kabila 
noted that DRC Vice President (and Congolese Liberation 
Movement, MLC,  President) Jean Pierre Bemba had written the 
International Committee to Accompany the Transition (CIAT) 
asking for CIAT intervention to resolve the political impasse 
over allocation of the state companies\' senior positions. 
The CIAT last week issued a communique on the subject (ref 
B), which declined to recommend specific appointments but did 
emphasize principles of professional, apolitical management; 
the need for full transparency; and avoiding use of the 
companies for campaign or other political purposes. 
Smiling, Kabila asked if the communiqu constituted the 
CIAT,s official response to Bemba,s letter, or if something 
more would be forthcoming.  SRSG Swing, speaking on behalf of 
the Ambassadors present, (all of whom are CIAT members), 
affirmed that the communique constituted CIAT,s answer. 
Kabila did not comment further, although Presidency Chief of 
Staff Boshab recommended that, for form,s sake, a letter be 
sent to Bemba referencing the communique to answer formally 
Bemba,s letter.  The CIAT members present agreed. 
 
3. (C)  Kabila also asked if the CIAT had been briefed 
regarding another impasse over security services, and the 
current \"government\" (comment: meaning Presidency) position. 
Presidency Special Advisor Kaputo intervened that such a 
briefing had not been provided, and proceeded to spell out 
Presidency thinking.  According to Kaputo, Bemba,s MLC and 
the Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma) both insist 
that they appoint a new director for Congo,s immigration 
service (DGM).  Both are willing to have the \"ex-government\" 
(i.e., Kabila,s PPRD party) appoint the ANR director, but 
neither will budge regarding the DGM.  Kaputo said that, in 
an attempt to break the logjam, the Presidency has proposed 
that none of the three former principal belligerents (MLC, 
RCD-Goma, ex-government) appoint directors for either agency. 
 Instead, the \"civil society\" component of the government 
would appoint the ANR director, and the \"political 
opposition\" component would appoint the DGM head.  Expanding, 
Kaputo said RCD-Goma would appoint a deputy to the ANR 
director, and the MLC would assign one to the DGM.  The 
\"ex-government\" would assign deputies to both.  Kaputo 
additionally outlined allocation and control of various 
internal office director positions, e.g., RCD-Goma in charge 
of \"External\" services, Mai Mai to get the \"Administration\" 
branch, etc.  Kaputo said that all parties agree to the 
formula, with the notable exceptions of the MLC and RCD-Goma, 
who both continue to insist that they appoint the DGM 
director. 
 
4. (C) Kabila concluded the meeting by reiterating his 
readiness for the \"Espace Presidentiel\" (the President and 
four Vice Presidents) to meet again with the CIAT as soon as 
possible.  He noted, however, that two Vice Presidents, 
Ruberwa and Z,Ahidi Ngoma, are not currently in Kinshasa. 
 
5. (C) Comment: The Presidency is probably largely satisfied 
with the CIAT communique, as it can be interpreted as siding 
with the basic Presidency position asserting that state 
companies are not subject to the same politically-based 
division as other transition institutions.  In fact, the Sun 
City Accord is somewhat ambiguous, explicitly listing 
criteria such as integrity and morality for these positions, 
but leaving ambiguous the formula to be used to fill the 
jobs.  The current fight is really largely over an effort by 
the various parties to tap into the companies as cash cows 
for individual and party activities.   The immigration and 
security services are a different issue.  Whatever the 
outcome, we suspect the ANR stands to lose further ground as 
an influential body for the remainder of the transition 
period.  The fight over the DGM position probably boils down 
to money.  RCD-Goma needs access to the potential revenue 
flow that the immigration service holds, and undoubtedly the 
MLC would like to control that revenue source itself. 
RCD-Goma might also secondarily want to try to augment its 
influence over eastern border controls, although in fact the 
ANR now has a better national infrastructure and staffing at 
border points than does the DGM.  End comment.

told poloff that over the past month, ethnic tension in Goma 
has become increasingly noticeable. She opined that an 
increase in ethnic tension combined with ongoing arming of 
Rwandophone civilians in Masisi, continuous reports of 
small-scale fighting between ex-ANC elements and the FARDC, 
and the fact that Governor Serufuli increasingly behaves like 
a \"local dictator instead of a state employee\" are troubling. 
A MONUC poloff said that the situation \"wasn\'t looking good\" 
and said it appears that both sides may be preparing for a 
more serious confrontation. During the week of December 27, 
Congolese sources in North Kivu told political assistants 
they were concerned that serious fighting in North Kivu would 
resume. 
 
North-South Kivu Border 
----------------------- 
 
3. (C) On December 30, a MONUC officer reported that Kivu 
Brigade Commander General Isberg met with North Kivu military 
regional commander BG Amisi on December 29. Amisi reportedly 
told Isberg that he was concerned with the situation near 
Minova (northern South Kivu), said President Kabila had told 
him to deploy a \"neutral\" company to Kalehe (southern North 
Kivu), and claimed that Governor Serufuli was directing the 
situation and was trying to encourage discord between the 
North and South Kivu military regions. On December 30, an 
international NGO worker in Goma told poloff that in the past 
few weeks up to 20,000 civilians had been displaced from 
Bweramana (on the border of North and South Kivu, between 
Kalehe and Minova) towards Minova. Generals Isberg, Mabe and 
Amisi were scheduled to meet in Minova on December 30. 
 
Walikale Territory 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) On December 29, BG Amisi reportedly told Isberg that 
he had heard that four ex-ANC (RCD/G military wing)battalions 
planned to advance towards Walikale along three axes, with 
the first advance along the Ntoto axis already under way. 
Amisi reportedly said he had heard that the 91st (Mai Mai) 
and 36th (unknown) Brigades intended to advance on Masisi, 
and added that General Buki (Army Chief of Staff) had told 
him that if the ex-ANC advanced on Walikale, it would be 
attacked by aerial bombing. (Note: Unsure if FARDC has 
capacity to conduct aerial bombing operations. End note.) 
 
5. (SBU) On December 29, MONUC confirmed that Mai Mai and 
ex-ANC from the 11th Brigade killed civilians and committed 
other human rights violations when ex-ANC soldiers withdrew 
from areas near Walikale town during mid-December. Mai Mai 
from the 91st Brigade have controlled Walikale town since 
December 18. Mai Mai soldiers executed three civilians (one 
Rwandan, one Kinyarwanda-speaking Congolese, and one Mushi), 
and arrested and executed six ex-ANC soldiers in Walikale 
territory. Ex-ANC soldiers from the 11th Brigade also killed 
four civilians and one soldier in the area of Kilambo, and 
kidnapped dozens of civilians from Mubi, Walikale town, 
Murakato and Tutero who were forced to carry looted goods 
towards Masisi territory. 
 
Nyabiondo--Masisi Territory 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (C) On December 30, MONUC poloff reported that there were 
ongoing clashes between FARDC (mostly believed to be Mai Mai) 
and ex-ANC troops in the area of Kibua (between Nyabiondo and 
Masisi).  On December 29, Radio Okapi reported that Nyabiondo 
was under the control of soldiers from the ex-ANC\'s 12th 
Brigade after fighting between the ex-ANC and Mai Mai from 
December 18-20. Up to 100 civilians were killed, a large 
number of civilians were displaced, and a church was 
reportedly attacked during a service. Reportedly, Mai Mai 
have been pushed about 15km north of Nyabiondo towards 
Lushebero. During the week of December 27, a MONUC team 
visited Masisi and found the area between Goma and Masisi 
mostly calm. The team, however, saw the local administrator 
in Masisi distribute arms to Rwandophone civilians, and 
received reports that civilians had been killed. MONUC has 
also received reports that ex-ANC troops from the 12th 
Brigade are traveling from Kanyabayonga towards Kibua. 
 
Buramba--Rutshuru Territory 
--------------------------- 
7. (C) On December 30, an international NGO worker told 
poloff that at least 16 civilians were killed in mid-December 
by ex-ANC soldiers in Buramba (100 km northeast of Goma). The 
ex-ANC soldiers reportedly attacked the village in 
retaliation for the death of two ex-ANC soldiers. They forced 
all civilians to leave the village, and would not let anyone 
return for about 10 days, during which time they 
systematically looted homes. Two civilians who attempted to 
return were reportedly shot and killed. 
 
Humanitarian Corridor Opens 
--------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) On December 30, OFDA officer told poloff that a 
humanitarian convoy reached Kayna (15km north of 
Kanyabayonga) on December 29, and the Lubero-Goma road was 
open to humanitarian trucks but not to commercial truck 
traffic. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Although the area north of Kanyabayonga has quieted 
and humanitarian relief efforts are underway, fighting and 
troop movements continue in parts of North Kivu that used to 
be under RCD/G control--notably Rutshuru and Masisi. 
Although the Kanyabayonga cease-fire is a positive 
development, the real possibility of an ex-ANC/FARDC showdown 
is not over. At this point, any number of scenarios are 
possible, including the possibility that the ex-ANC is 
interested in re-asserting military control over part of its 
previous zone of influence in North Kivu-- notably the area 
from Goma north to Kanyabayonga, south to Kalehe, west to 
Walikale, and Masisi and Rutshuru territories. These 
contiguous areas have high concentrations of Rwandophones and 
local administrators loyal to the ex-ANC.  It appears that 
ex-ANC and RCD/G hardliners have decided to focus on 
controlling this territory.

1. Program Title: NGO Management I 
Program Type: Multi-Regional Project 
Project Number: E/VM-2005-0002 
Participant: Lembe Mouandza, Patricia 
Profession: Lawyer 
Title: Legal Advisor 
Employer: Thomas Sankara Pan-African Association 
Note: Ms. Lembe spoke with DCM on November 12 and 
presented a 6-page written report. 
 
2. Participant\'s Assessment: Patricia Lembe said that 
she was particularly impressed by the variety of U.S. 
NGOs and the variety of relationships they have with 
funding sources, both public and private.  She also 
noted the strong historic assurance of tax exemption 
for non-profit organizations and the indirect support 
provided for charitable activity by the possibility for 
individual U.S. taxpayers to deduct charitable 
contributions from taxed income. 
 
3. Ms. Lembe particularly liked the ideas for fund- 
raising and the program focus on leadership as a 
\"process of influencing the thinking behaviors and 
actions of others toward a shared purpose.\"  She also 
was impressed by the level of volunteerism in the U.S. 
and found it useful to work with volunteers for three 
hours at the San Diego Food Bank. 
 
4. Program structure:  Ms. Lembe said that, besides the 
professional part of the program, she enjoyed the 
historic and cultural excursions.  She cited the visit 
to the Amish community in Ohio, \"which largely relies 
on its own members to solve local concerns without 
government intervention.\" 
 
5. Goals and Impact: Ms. Lembe said that she planned to 
apply some of the fund-raising techniques that she 
learned during the program and to try to recruit more 
volunteers for her organization.  On December 17, she 
hosted a round-table discussion, with lunch provided by 
the Embassy, on NGO management.  There were 15 
participants attended from Brazzaville-based NGOs.  Ms. 
Lembe shared her experiences in the IVLP program and 
led a discussion on NGO fund-raising, leadership, and 
administration.  Ms. Lembe noted the importance of 
attracting a variety of funding sources, as well as 
providing appropriate financial and program reports. 
She and the other participants reviewed methods for 
obtaining Congolese government funding, as well as the 
challenges they faced in recruiting volunteers.  DCM 
discussed the purposes and requirements of USG-funded 
programs, such as Ambassador\'s Special Self-Help, 
Democracy and Human Rights Fund, and Ambassador\'s Fund 
for Cultural Preservation, as well as the elements of a 
good application for such funding.  The program was 
received very favorably by the participants.

REF: A. KINSHASA 2168

     C. KINSHASA 1578 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The GDRC carried out a sizeable cabinet 
reshuffle January 3, replacing the Ministers of Defense, 
Mines, and Energy, among others.  The long-awaited move is 
the outcome of a recent parliamentary report on official 
corruption, combined with a desire on the part of the 
RCD-Goma\'s leadership to enforce party discipline.  These 
changes should not significantly affect USG interests.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) The GDRC carried out a cabinet reshuffle January 3, 
involving eleven different ministries.  (Note:  The 36 
ministerial and 25 vice-ministerial posts in the transitional 
government are divided up among the various factions in 
power, each of which has authority to nominate and and 
replace \"its\" respective appointees.  According to the new 
lineup, four of the 36 ministries will be headed by women, as 
before.  End Note.)  Although the move mostly affected the 
six ministers who were suspended in November 2004 after being 
cited by a parliamentary report on official corruption (Ref 
A), both the People\'s Party for Reconstruction and Democracy 
(PPRD) and the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD-Goma) made 
additional changes.  Post will provide bio information on key 
ministers septel. 
 
REPLACEMENTS DUE TO PARLIAMENTARY REPORT ON CORRUPTION: 
 
Minister of Mines - Ingele Ifoto (political opposition), 
replaces Eugene Diomi 
 
Minister of Energy - Pierre Muziumba Mwana Hembe (PPRD), 
replaces Kalema Lusona 
 
Foreign Trade - Chantal Ngalula Mulumba (RCD-N), replaces 
Roger Lumbala (Note: Ngalula is reportedly Lumbala\'s wife. 
End Note.) 
 
Public Works and Infrastructure - left vacant (MLC), (Note: 
pending replacement of Jose Endundo.  End Note.) 
 
Transport - Eva Mwakasa (political opposition), replaces 
Joseph Olengankhoy 
 
University and Higher Education - Jean-Pierre Lola Kisanga 
(RCD-Goma), replaces Joseph Mudumbi 
 
REPLACEMENTS DUE TO RCD-GOMA RE-DESIGNATION OF MINISTERS: 
 
Minister of Defense - Adolphe Onusumba (RCD-Goma), replaces 
Jean-Pierre Ondekane 
 
Minister of Economy - Floribert Bokanga (RCD-Goma), replaces 
Emile Ngoy 
 
Labor - Boniface Balamage Nkolo (RCD-Goma), replaces 
Jean-Pierre Lola Kisanga 
 
REPLACEMENT DUE TO PPRD RE-DESIGNATION OF MINISTERS: 
 
Health - Emile Bongeli ye Ikelo (PPRD), replaces Athanasie 
Moleko Moliwa 
 
REPLACEMENT DUE TO VACANCY: 
 
Social Affairs - Laurent Otete Omanga (political opposition), 
replaces Ingele Ifoto 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (SBU)  The shuffle came as no surprise to Kinshasa 
observers, in the wake of the parliamentary report on 
corruption, and after months of infighting among RCD-Goma 
leaders.  It is unclear whether the continued vacancy at 
Public Works (a slot reserved for Vice President Jean-Pierre 
Bemba\'s Congo Liberation Movement) means Bemba is still 
trying to keep Jose Endundo, perhaps his closest confidant 
and adviser, in the job or whether the MLC chief simply has 
not yet decided on a replacement.  The outgoing PPRD Health 
Minister was widely perceived as ineffective.  The new 
RCD-Goma Ministers of Defense and Economy are closer to Vice 
President Ruberwa than were their predecessors, both of whom 
remained in Kinshasa in August when Ruberwa and other 
RCD-Goma officials temporarily suspended their participation 
in the transitional government.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: KABILA\'S QUIET KISANGANI VISIT 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  On January 3, President Kabila arrived in 
Kisangani, Province Orientale with little fanfare or advance 
notice. On January 5, Kabila met with several Ituri warlords 
scheduled to become FARDC brigadier generals.  The President 
appears to be inspecting the new FARDC forward operations 
base, and meeting with FARDC and GSSP troops. Kabila\'s second 
visit to eastern DRC since becoming President has, 
encouragingly, been a relative non-event. End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On January 3, President Kabila arrived in Kisangani 
in time for the national \'Day of Martyrs\' on January 4. 
(Note: Kisangani is known as the \"City of Martyrs\" due to its 
residents\' suffering during the war. End note.). Kabila\'s 
second trip to eastern DRC since becoming president was 
marked by little fanfare or advance notice. According to a 
local source, no additional presidential guard (GSSP) troops 
were deployed, the President had not made any public 
statements, and one wouldn\'t even know the President was 
there-- a marked contrast to Kabila\'s October 2004 trip. 
 
3. (SBU) On October 4, Kabila reportedly visited Walikale via 
helicopter to visit FARDC troops and then drove 30km outside 
of Kisangani. The local source said that Kabila\'s Kisangani 
agenda included meeting with FARDC troops, following up on 
public works projects, and possibly examining some of the 
tensions between the GSSP and the FARDC. 
 
4. (U) On January 5, Kabila met with four of the five Ituri 
warlords scheduled to become FARDC brigadier generals in the 
near future. Bosco Ntanga, Chief of Staff of Thomas Lubanga\'s 
UPC, was notably absent. A UPC spokesman said Bosco was too 
ill to travel, and was not \"ignoring the call\" of the 
President. (Note: Bosco was reportedly injured in recent 
fighting between the UPC and FNI in Largu. End note.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
5. (SBU) At first glance, Kabila appears to be inspecting the 
new FARDC forward operations base, and meeting with FARDC and 
GSSP troops.  So far, the most notable aspect of Kabila\'s 
second trip to the east since becoming President is its 
seemingly relaxed, \"normal\" nature in a country where the 
head of state was unable to visit half of the nation in his 
first years in office.

SUBJECT:  LABOR SECTOR UPDATE 
 
REF: A) 04 KINSHASA 450, B) 04 KINSHASA 1474 
 
1. (U) From Nov-Dec 2004, a series of civil servant 
strikes to claim salary payments and raises occurred in 
both government organizations and state-owned 
enterprises. In 2003-2004, the GDRC negotiated a civil 
service restructuring plan with the World Bank without 
union involvement. The GDRC designed a salary increase 
of 20 percent (or FC 133) calculated on a base salary 
of FC 665 (approx. USD 1.60) per month. Due to the lack 
of inclusion in negotiations and continued low pay per 
the new plan, civil service unions considered 
organizing another general strike, along the lines of 
Feb-April events (Ref A). 
 
2. (U) On December 20, 2004, the Ministry of Civil 
Service called a two-day meeting with civil service 
unions to continue negotiations. The Minister of Civil 
Service again presented to the unions the civil service 
restructuring plan - including the proposed pay raise 
and the forced retirement and voluntary departures for 
some employees.  Unions initially resisted adopting the 
restructuring plan, but in the end accepted it. Both 
the GDRC and the unions agreed to make the salary 
increase effective in the 2005 Budget. The Minister of 
Civil Service, meanwhile, promised to pay salary 
arrears for 2004 by the end of 2004 and to meet payroll 
obligations regularly in 2005. 
 
3. (U) While accepting the government plan, the civil 
service unions fear arriving at the same fate as 
Gecamines employees who took severance pay packages 
developed without prior negotiation.  Those workers 
received approx USD 3,000, as well as promises of 
employment assistance and training, but the latter have 
not materialized.  Civil servants want to avoid this 
fate by getting the World Bank involved, preferably 
from the unions\' standpoint through their inclusion in 
ongoing discussion between the GDRC and the Bank 
regarding general public service reform. Thus far, the 
Bank shows no interest in this proposal. 
 
4. (SBU) Comment: The unions continue to push for the 
GDRC to return to the repudiated Mbudi negotiations of 
Feb 2004 (Ref A) in which GDRC Vice President Z\'Ahidi 
Ngoma promised significant cash payments which would in 
fact have broken the bank. GDRC adherence to the deal 
would have dictated violating the terms of its IMF 
commitments, and there is no prospect of such a deal in 
the foreseeable future. The World Bank shows little 
inclination to become directly involved with the civil 
service unions, viewing them as implacable and often 
irrational. In fact, the civil service unions remain 
largely disorganized and have only had a limited impact 
in recent months (Ref B). Given the relatively weak 
position of labor and the poor record of these unions, 
the Embassy does not see a strong potential for civil 
disturbances related to the labor sector at this time.

commission president implied that elections would take place 
in October instead of June 2005.  Major police/protestor 
clashes occurred in the areas of Masina (en route to the main 
airport), Kingasani, and Binza IPN, all 7-10 kilometers from 
the Gombe area where all USG facilities are located and where 
all Embassy employees reside.  Police did not allow 
demonstrators to mass and move into the Gombe area.  Instead, 
they deployed to known \"hot spots\" and broke up the 
malcontents before they could get transport into the Gombe 
area.  An estimated four to thirteen civilians and two 
policemen died, dozens were wounded, and authorities arrested 
over seventy on charges of vandalism.  One Amcit was the 
victim of a carjacking by protestors in the Binza-IPN area, 
but was unharmed and retrieved his vehicle on January 11. 
The U.S. Mission maintained normal operations throughout the 
day with no incidents noted, although some locally-engaged 
staff were unable to come to work because of the 
unavailability of public transportation early in the day.  No 
other cities experienced demonstrations or unrest, and 
Kinshasa itself was quiet on January 11 and 12. 
 
3. (SBU) Most observers directly or indirectly blamed 
political opposition figure Etienne Tshisekedi for the 
unrest, though GDRC officials such as the Minister of 
Information did not say so publicly.  If it was an attempt to 
demonstrate the amount of support for Tshisekedi, it fell 
flat because university students by and large did not 
participate.  (Comment:  In the 1990s, support for Tshisekedi 
was such that his party, the UDPS, could literally bring 
Kinshasa to a halt through strikes and boycotts.  At a 
January 12 meeting with the Ambassador, Tshisekedi denied any 
involvement in the recent unrest.  End Comment.) 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT:  Post will continue to monitor the 
situation.  Already the Kinshasa rumor mill is speculating 
about the possibility of more unrest on Friday, January 14, 
close to the the January 17 anniversary of Patrice Lumumba\'s 
assassination and the January 18 anniversary of Laurent 
Kabila\'s assassination.  END COMMENT.
