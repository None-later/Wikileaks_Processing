SUBJECT: KUWAITI SAUDI RELATIONS - A KUWAITI PERSPECTIVE 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
 
2.  SUMMARY 
-   ------- 
 
GIVEN THE VAST DIMENSIONS OF THE GULF CRISIS AND THE 
INTENSE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT AT 
THE PRESENT TIME, FRICTION OR DISAGREEMENTS ARE AMAZINGLY 
FEW AND GENERALLY OF A MARGINAL NATURE - AT LEAST FROM 
THE KUWAITI PERSPECTIVE.  THERE ARE, HOWEVER, AS MIGHT BE 
EXPECTED GIVEN THE PASSAGE OF TIME, A NUMBER OF RUBS IN 
THE RELATIONSHIP.  WHILE KUWAITI OFFICIALS REMAIN 
GENERALLY CONFIDENT ABOUT SAUDI POLICY, THERE ARE 
CONCERNS LACED WITH FEAR OVER THE SAUDIS BOTH WITHIN AND 
OUTSIDE THE AL SAUD FAMILY WHO ESPOUSE COMPROMISE WITH 
IRAQ AT KUWAITI EXPENSE.  KUWAITIS ALSO QUESTION THE 
SAUDI DECISION TO LOCATE THE GOK IN ISOLATED TAIF AND 
THEY ARE UPSET OVER SAUDI CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR REBUILDING 
OF THE KUWAITI MILITARY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
3.  KUWAIT LITERALLY DRIVEN INTO SAUDI ARABIA 
-   ----------------------------------------- 
 
THE AUGUST 2 IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT AND SUBSEQUENT 
IRAQI BRUTALITIES IN KUWAIT LITERALLY DROVE KUWAIT INTO 
SAUDI ARABIA.  THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES AND THE BULK OF 
KUWAIT\'S GOVER`MENT ARRIVED ON THE SCENE IN NEED OF 
SUPPORT AND SUSTENANCE.  THE SAUDIS WERE AND REMAIN 
GENEROUS WITH BOTH.  THE SAUD FAMILY OPENLY RECALLED THE 
SABAH FAMILY (AND KUWAITI) SUPPORT FOR THE SAUDS DURING 
THEIR EXILE FROM SAUDI ARABIA EARLIER IN THE CENTURY AND 
THEY MADE CLEAR THEY WERE STANDING BY THEIR FRIENDS IN 
NEED DURING THIS CRISIS.  SAUDI SUPPORT HAS BEEN 
EXTENSIVE WITH MATERIAL AID (FOOD AND HOUSING) TO 
THOUSANDS OF DISPLACED KUWAITI NATIONALS.  THE SAG HAS 
ALSO HELPED THE GOK TO RECONSTITUTE ITSELF IN THE KINGDOM 
AND HAS FACILITATED THE COMINGS AND GOINGS OF KUWAITI 
OFFICIALS AND THEIR GUESTS.  GENERALLY THE SAUDIS HAVE 
GIVEN THE GOK FREE REIGN MOST DRAMATICALLY SEEN IN THE 
CONVOCATION OF AN ALL-KUWAITI CONFERENCE THAT HIGH- 
LIGHTED KUWAITI COMMITMENTS TO PARTICIPATORY GOVERNMENT. 
ON THE MILITARY FRONT, THE SAUDIS PERMITTED THE KUWAITIS 
TO REFURBISH THEIR AIR FORCE ON SAUDI BASES AND THERE IS 
A SIMILAR PROGRAM WITH KUWAITI LAND FORCES. 
 
4.  KUWAITIS CONTINUE TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION FOR SAUDI 
HOSPITALITY AND GENEROSITY AND THAT GRATITUDE REMAINS 
BASIC IN THE RELATIONSHIP.  AT THE SAME TIME THE KUWAITIS 
DO EXPRESS SOME FRUSTRATION - LARGELY STEMMING FROM AN 
UNNATURAL DEPENDENCY.  MANY KUWAITI OFFICIALS ARE 
INCREASINGLY UNHAPPY WITH THE LOCATION OF THE GOK IN 
TAIF.  WHILE INITIALLY ACCEPTING THE SAUDI ARGUMENT IN 
FAVOR OF SECURITY, WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND A CHANGED 
POLITICAL AND MILITARY SITUATION IN THE AREA, THE 
KUWAITIS NOW FEEL INCREASINGLY ISOLATED AND CUT OFF FROM 
EVENTS.  KUWAITI OFFICIALS NOTE THAT VISITORS (INCLUDING 
A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF U.S. CONGRESSIONAL GROUPS) PASS 
THROUGH NEARBY JEDDAH BUT DO NOT MAKE IT TO TAIF.  THEY 
LISTEN TO NEWSCASTERS WHO REPEATEDLY DISPARAGE THE GOK AS 
RESIDENT IN  A POSH HOTEL IN THE SAUDI MOUNTAIN RESORT. 
KUWAITIS IN EXILE CERTAINLY DO NOT CONSIDER TAIF A RESORT 
AND DESPAIR AT THE MEDIA\'S CONTINUED HARPING ON THIS 
THEME.  THE KUWAITIS TEND TO BLAME THE SAUDIS FOR THEIR 
PREDICAMENT.  WE HEAR MORE AND MORE TALK FROM THE 
KUWAITIS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO RELOCATE BUT THEY 
BELIEVE THE SAUDIS WILL NOT AGREE. 
 
 
5.  KING SOLID, UNCERTAINTY ABOUT OTHERS 
-   ------------------------------------ 
 
THE KUWAITIS REMAIN GENERALLY CONVINCED THAT SAUDI POLICY 
IS FIRMLY BEHIND FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSC RESOLUTIONS 
- SPECIFICALLY FULL AND COMPLETE IRAQI WITHDRAWAL AND 
RETURN OF THE LEGITIMATE KUWAITI GOVERNMENT.  THIS 
CONVICTION RESTS LARGELY ON THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE AMIR AND KING FAHD.  KUWAITIS REPEATEDLY 
REFER TO THE KING\'S STAUNCH SUPPORT.  IN DOING SO, 
HOWEVER, IT OFTEN IMPLIES AN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE 
STRENGTH OF SUPPORT ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT.  AT VARIOUS TIMES ONE HAS HEARD CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE POSITION OF CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH OR DEFENSE 
MINISTER PRINCE SULTAN, BUT THESE DOUBTS APPEAR MORE A 
CONSEQUENCE OF THE EVER ONGOING KUWAITI PROPENSITY  TO 
DISSECT AND TO ANALYZE EACH AND EVERY INDICATOR OF 
POSSIBLE SHIFTS IN ATTITUDES TOWARD THEIR CAUSE.  THERE 
ARE ALWAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, NERVOUS DISCUSSIONS OF EACH NEWS 
REPORT THAT SOME ARAB OR OTHER POLITICAL FIGURE IS 
UNDERTAKING AN EFFORT TO MEDIATE THE CRISIS.  INEVITABLY, 
THEY FRET OVER ANY INDICATION THE SAUDIS MAY BE INVOLVED. 
THUS FAR, SENIOR KUWAITI OFFICIALS REMAIN CONVINCED THAT 
SAUDI POLICY IS FIRM, BUT ONE NOW HEARS MORE RUMBLINGS 
THAN BEFORE FROM LESSER OFFICIALS CONCERNED THAT SAUDI 
DETERMINATION MAY ERODE.  THEY CITE MOUNTING DEBATE 
WITHIN THE KINGDOM BY SOME LESSER MEMBERS OF THE SAUD 
FAMILY AS WELL AS NON-ROYALS OVER THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE 
KINGDOM SHOULD RISK WAR AND DISTRUCTION FOR KUWAIT, AND 
WHETHER KUWAIT SHOULD COMPROMISE AND OFFER SADDAM 
FACE-SAVING CONCESSIONS. 
 
6.  KUWAITI-SAUDI COOPERATION FINANCIALLY IN SUPPORT OF 
COALITION PARTNERS HAS BEEN CLOSE AND GENERALLY 
HARMONIOUS.  WORKING SOMEWHAT WITHIN A GCC CONTEXT THE 
TWO HAVE BASICALLY AGREEED ON RECIPIENTS AND LEVELS.  THE 
KUWAITIS ARE PROBABLY MORE WILLING THAN SAUDI ARABIA TO 
PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE TO YEMEN BUT THEY BOW TO STRONG 
SAUDI FEELINGS.  THE KUWAITIS SEEM AS FIRM AS THE SAUDIS 
IN OPPOSING AID TO JORDAN.  THE ONLY FRICTIONS WE DETECT 
IN THIS AREA WAS IN THE ALLOCATION OF DOLS 100 MILLION IN 
KUWAITI ASSISTANCE TO SOME SMALLER STATES (DJIBOUTI, 
SOMALIA, AND LEBANON).  THE KUWAITIS APPARENTLY GAVE 
THEIR DOLS 100 MILLION TO THE SAUDIS TO DISBURSE.  THE 
SAUDIS WITHOUT ASKING RECONFIGURED THE APPORTIONMENT 
AFTER THE KUWAITIS HAD TOLD THOSE GOVERNMENTS OF THEIR 
AID LEVELS LEADING TO SOME EMBARRASSMENT TO KUWAIT. 
 
 
7.  SOME SNAGS IN MILITARY COOPERATION 
-   ---------------------------------- 
 
MILITARY COOPERATION APPEARS TO BE LARGELY SUCCESSFUL 
THOUGH WE ARE NOW HEARING REPORTS OF SOME DIFFICULTIES IN 
THIS AREA.  WHEN IRAQ INVADED KUWAIT, KUWAITI PILOTS FLEW 
THEIR FIGHTERS TO SAUDI ARABIA.  KUWAITI SOURCES SAY THE 
SAUDIS REFUSED TO REFUEL THE PLANES SO THEY COULD 
CONTINUE TO FIGHT.  ULTIMATELY THE  SAUDIS BASED THE 
KUWAITI A-4S IN KHAMIS MUSHAYT AND THE MIRAGE FIGHTERS IN 
TAIF.  IN THE DAYS AFTER THE INVASION, THE REMNANTS OF 
KUWAITI LAND FORCES STRAGGLED ACROSS THE SAUDI BORDER AND 
WERE EVENTUALLY COLLECTED IN HAFR AL-BATIN.  THROUGH THE 
PAST THREE MONTHS THE GOK MADE A HIGH PRIORITY OF GETTING 
THEIR FORCES REORGANIZED AND READY TO HELP LIBERATE THEIR 
COUNTRY.  WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE SAUDIS THEY OBTAINED 
PERMISSION FOR THE ENTRY OF U.S. TECHNICIANS, SPARE 
PARTS, AND MUNITIONS FOR THE A-4 PROGRAM.  THE PLANES ARE 
NOW FLYING AND PARTICIPATED IN THE RECENT EXERCISE WITH 
U.S. FORCES.  A SENIOR KUWAIT OFFICIAL, WHO RECENTLY 
DISCUSSED THIS SUCCESS STORY, RELATED, HOWEVER, THAT THE 
SAUDIS HAD STRONGLY RESISTED MOVING THE A-4\'S FROM 
SOUTHWESTERN SAUDI ARABIA TO THE EASTERN PROVINCE 
PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE SAUDIS WERE AFRAID THE KUWAIT AIR 
FORCE MIGHT PRECIPITATE HOSTILITIES WITH THE IRAQIS.  THE 
KUWAIT OFFICIAL SAID THE GOK BROUGHT MAJOR PRESSURE TO 
BEAR AT SENIOR LEVELS IN THE SAG TO FORCE THE SAUDIS TO 
AGREE TO THE MOVEMENT. 
 
8.  SIMILAR DIFFICULTIES REPORTEDLY CONTINUE WITH EFFORTS 
TO REORGANIZE KUWAITI LAND FORCES.  KUWAITI OFFICIALS 
COMPLAIN THE SAUDIS ARE SLOW IN ANY DECISION RELATED TO 
THIS EFFORT INCLUDING DELIVERY OF ITEMS NEEDED TO 
RE-EQUIP THE NEW BRIGADES AS WELL AS LAUNCHING THE 
TRAINING PROGRAM.  IN A RARE DISPLAY OF REAL ANGER TOWARD 
THE SAUDIS, ANOTHER KUWAITI OFFICIAL ACCUSED THE SAUDIS 
OF BLOCKING KUWAITI EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A TRAINING CAMP 
FOR UP TO 30,000 NEW RECRUITS.  THE OFFICIAL SAID THE GOK 
HAD BEEN PRESSING THE SAG FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS TO 
PROVIDE A SITE WHERE BASIC TRAINING COULD TAKE PLACE; BUT 
THE SAUDIS SEEMED OPPOSED TO SUCH AN EFFORT.  HE SAID THE 
GOK WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS THE SAUDIS. 
 
 
9.  OVERALL:  CLOSE COOPERATION, DESPITE A FEW FRICTIONS 
-   --------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
ALL IN ALL, GIVEN THE BIZARRE SITUATION, RELATIONS 
BETWEEN KUWAITIS AND SAUDIS - AT LEAST FROM THE KUWAITI 
PERSPECTIVE - REMAIN REMARKEDLY GOOD.  THE MANY AREAS OF 
CLOSE COOPERATION AND INTERRELATIONSHIP REFLECT THE 
FUNDAMENTAL MUTUAL INTERESTS OF THE TWO AS WELL AS THE 
ADMITTEDLY DEPENDENT POSITION OF THE GOK AT THIS TIME. 
MUCH OF THE NEGATIVES WE HEAR ARE EASILY UNDERSTOOD AS 
STEMMING FROM CONTINUED KUWAITI FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE 
EVOLVING CRISIS SITUATION.  MOST ARE TO BE EXPECTED AND 
ON BALANCE IT IS SURPRISING HOW FEW PROBLEMS WE FIND.  AT 
THE SAME TIME THERE ARE SOME FRICTIONS AND THEY WILL GROW 
AS MORE TIME PASSES WITHOUT ANY DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE 
CRISIS.  WE DO NOT, HOWEVER, EXPECT THESE FRICTIONS TO 
AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY THE CLOSE COOPERATION THAT EXISTS 
BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS DURING THE CRISIS. 
 
10.  DOHA MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

SUBJECT: JEDDAH\'S MERCHANT ELITE: THE ALIREZAS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION:  THE ALIREZAS ARE JEDDAH\'S 
FIRST FAMILY AND AMONG THE MERCHANT ELITE THEY ARE 
CLEARLY PRIMA INTRA PARAS.  AT PUBLIC RECEPTIONS SENIOR 
ALIREZAS ARE DEFERRED TO BY ALL BUT THE AL-SAUD.  WHILE 
PROBABLY NOT THE OLDEST OR RICHEST FAMILY IN JEDDAH, 
THEIR LINEAGE, REPUTATION, CONNECTIONS AND TRADITION OF 
PUBLIC SERVICE GIVE THEM A UNIQUE PLACE IN JEDDAH\'S 
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE.  THIS POSITION WAS ACQUIRED 
OVER THE PAST 150 YEARS THROUGH A SERIES OF ASTUTE 
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL MOVES.  THIS CABLE, WHICH 
DESCRIBES SOME OF THESE MOVES, IS BASED ON NUMEROUS 
CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS INCLUDING A TWO HOUR 
MEETING WITH THE CURRENT HEAD OF THE FAMILY SHAIKH AHMED 
YUSSEF ZAINAL ALIREZA.  A SECOND CABLE WILL FOCUS ON THE 
STRUCTURE OF THE FAMILY\'S COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES.  END 
SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
3.  THE ALIREZAS PROUDLY, IF SOMEWHAT UNBELIEVABLY, 
CLAIM DESCENT FROM ONE OF ISLAM\'S GREAT HEROS AMR IBN 
AL-ASS.  AMR WAS A MECCAN NOTABLE WHO BACKED THE PROPHET 
MOHAMMAD, LED ONE OF THE FIRST MUSLIM ARMIES INTO SYRIA 
IN 633 AND IN 639 DIRECTED THE ARAB CONQUEST OF EGYPT 
WHERE HE REMAINED AS GOVERNOR FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS.  IN 
THE 8TH CENTURY ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS MIGRATED TO 
WESTERN IRAN - WHERE THE ALIREZAS REMAINED UNTIL ZAINAL 
ALIREZA RETURNED TO JEDDAH IN THE 1840.  ZAINAL, WHO WAS 
ONLY 12 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, WAS TAKEN IN BY THE ZAHID 
FAMILY WHO HAD ALSO MIGRATED FROM IRAN.  YOUNG ZAINAL WENT 
TO WORK IN THE ZAHID TOBACCO AND CARPET IMPORTING BUSINESS. 
AFTER SEVERAL YEARS, HE BEGAN TO IMPORT CLOTH AND 
FOODSTUFFS ON HIS OWN AND MARRIED ONE OF THE ZAHIDS, THUS 
BEGINING A TRADITION OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES 
WHICH CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. 
 
4.  ZAINAL WAS THE SECOND OF FOUR SONS AND BY 1860 HE WAS 
DOING WELL ENOUGH TO BRING HIS YOUNGER BROTHERS, ABDULLAH 
AND HUSSEIN, TO JEDDAH.  HE WAS SOME 20-25 YEARS OLDER 
THAN HIS BROTHERS AND TREATED THEM AS SONS.  IN 1880 
ZAINAL SENT ABDULLAH TO OPEN AN OFFICE IN INDIA SO THE 
FIRM COULD PURCHASE COMMODITIES DIRECTLY FROM PRODUCERS. 
THIS WAS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL MOVES WHICH BEGAN TO 
SEPARATE THE ALIREZAS FROM OTHER JEDDAH MERCHANTS. 
EVENTUALLY, THEY HAD PURCHASING OFFICES IN BOMBAY, 
CALCUTTA AND KARACHI.  EXPERIENCE IN BRITISH INDIA GAVE 
THEM VALUABLE EXPOSURE TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND MODERN 
BUSINESS PRACTICES WHICH THEIR COMPETITORS LACKED.  IN 
1893 THE FIRM SIGNED ITS FIRST FOREIGN CONTRACT AND 
BECAME AGENTS FOR THE BRITISH MOGUL LINE WHICH HAD A 
MONOPOLY ON SUBCONTINENT HAJJ TRAFFIC.  IN ADDITION TO 
MAKING THE FAMILY ITS FIRST REAL FORTUNE, THIS CONTRACT 
MOVED THEM FROM THE ROLE OF TRADITIONAL MERCHANT TO THAT 
OF SPONSOR FOR FOREIGN FIRMS. 
 
5.  ZAINAL RETIRED IN 1905 AND LIVED ON UNTIL 1927. 
ABDULLAH RETURNED FROM INDIA TO MANAGE THE FIRM WHILE 
ZAINAL\'S SONS KASSEM, MOHAMMAD ALI AND YUSSEF REMAINED IN 
INDIA.  BACK IN JEDDAH ABDULLAH BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE 
OTTOMAN TOWN COUNCIL.  AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR, SHARIF 
HUSSEIN OF MECCA APPOINTED ABDULLAH GOVERNOR OF JEDDAH. 
IN 1924 WHEN THE FORCES OF ABDULAZIZ AL-SAUD BESIEGED 
JEDDAH, ABDULLAH HELPED PERSUADE SHARIF HUSSEIN TO 
ABDICATE IN FAVOR OF HIS SON ALI.  WHEN THE SITUATION 
CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE, THE LAST HASHIMITE SHARIF FLED 
TO CYPRUS AND ABDULLAH ALIREZA SURRENDERED JEDDAH TO THE 
AL-SAUD.  SEEKING TO REASSURE HIS NEW SUBJECTS THAT 
JEDDAH\'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ORDER WOULD NOT BE 
OVERTURNED, KING ABDULAZIZ ASKED ABDULLAH ALIREZA TO STAY 
ON AS GOVERNOR.  SINCE THE HASHIMITES HAD TAKEN THEIR 
TREASURY WITH THEM, ABDULLAH ALSO LENT THE KING 6,000 
POUNDS TO MAINTAIN HIS  GOVERNMENT IN THE HIJAZ.  THE 
FAMILY EMERGED FROM THIS EPISODE WITH ITS PRESTIGE 
ENHANCED AND A NEW ROLE TO PLAY AS ADVISORS AND 
FINANCIERS TO KING ABDULAZIZ. 
 
6.  WHEN ABDULLAH DIED IN 1932, MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRM 
REVERTED TO THE SONS OF ZAINAL.  KASSEM HAD BEEN ACTIVE 
IN OTTOMAN REFORM POLITICS AND HAD REPRESENTED JEDDAH AT 
THE OTTOMAN PARLIAMENT IN 190B.  HE MARRIED A TURKISH 
WOMEN AND DIED IN ISTAMBUL IN 1927.  MOHAMMAD ALI IS 
REMEMBERED FOR ESTABLISHING JEDDAH\'S FIRST MODERN SCHOOL 
IN 1903.  KNOWN AS THE FALLAH SCHOOL, IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL 
IN MAKING ARABIC, RATHER THAN TURKISH, THE LANGUAGE OF 
INSTRUCTION.  MOHAMMAD ALI FINANCED HIS SCHOOL AND OTHERS 
LIKE IT IN MECCA, BAHRAIN, DUBAI AND BOMBAY WITH PROFITS 
FROM THE PEARL AND JEWELRY BUSINESS HE ESTABLISHED. 
SINCE MOHAMMAD ALI SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN PARIS AND 
BOMBAY, MANAGEMENT OF THE FAMILY\'S JEDDAH BUSINESS FELL 
TO YUSSEF ZAINAL ALIREZA WHO WAS BY THIS TIME NEARLY 50. 
 
7.  WHEN YUSSEF DIED, ABDULLAH\'S SONS MOHAMMAD AND ALI 
TOOK OVER THE FIRM.  MOHAMMAD WAS EDUCATED IN INDIA.  ALI 
WENT TO BERKELEY IN 1940 AND BECOME ONE OF THE FIRST 
SAUDIS TO STUDY IN AMERICA AND RETURN WITH AN AMERICAN 
WIFE.  DURING THE 40S AND FIFTIES THE TWO BROTHERS AGAIN 
DEMONSTRATED THE FAMILY\'S ABILITY TO SPOT OPPORTUNITIES 
AND CAPITALIZE ON THEIR FOREIGN EDUCATION.  THE ALIREZAS 
BECAME THE SAUDI REPRESENTATIVES FOR WESTINGHOUSE, 
GOODYEAR, PEPSI, FORD AND FOR A WHILE GM.  THEY 
EVENTUALLY SOLD THE GM DEALERSHIP TO THE ZAHIDS. 
 
8.  MOHAMMAD ABDULLAH AND ALI ABDULLAH WORKED CLOSELY 
WITH PRINCE FAISAL WHILE HE WAS VICEROY TO THE HIJAZ AND 
LATER FOREIGN MINISTER.  ALI BECAME A MINISTER OF STATE 
WITHOUT PORTFOLIO AND EVENTUALLY SAUDI AMBASSADOR TO 
WASHINGTON.  MOHAMMAD MOVED FROM PRESIDENT OF THE JEDDAH 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TO MINISTER OF COMMERCE.  AFTER 
FINANCE MINISTER ABDULLAH SULIMAN, HE WAS THE SECOND 
COMMONER TO EVER HOLD CABINET RANK IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
MOHAMMAD LEFT THE CABINET BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS WITH KING 
ABDULAZIZ\'S YOUNGER BROTHER ABDULLAH BIN ABDULRAHMAN WHO 
WAS A POWER AT COURT DURING THE REIGN OF KING SAUD. 
 
9.  DESPITE HIS PROBLEMS WITH \"UNCLE ABBY\", MOHAMMAD 
ABDULLAH ALIREZA REMAINED THE LEADER OF JEDDAH\'S 
MERCHANTS AND A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE AL-SAUD WHEN THEY 
WERE THREATENED BY NASSERISM.  IN THE EARLY 60S EGYPTIAN 
PLANES WERE BOMBING SOUTHERN SAUDI ARABIA FROM BASES IN 
YEMEN AND DROPPING ARMS TO TRIBAL DISSIDENTS NORTH OF 
JEDDAH.  CAIRO\'S VOICE OF THE ARABS WAS CALLING FOR A 
POPULAR UPRISING AGAINST THE AL-SAUD.  MOHAMMAD ALIREZA 
COUNTERED THIS PROPAGANDA BY ORGANIZING A MAHRAJAN - THE 
TRADITIONAL GATHERING OF THE TRIBES TO SWEAR LOYALTY TO A 
LEADER.  DURING THIS LARGE DEMONSTRATION HELD IN DOWNTOWN 
JEDDAH MOHAMMAD ABDULLAH ALIREZA REPEATED HIS FATHER\'S 
GESTURE BY HANDING PRINCE FAISAL A GOLD KEY TO THE CITY. 
 
10.  THIS WAS ALSO A PERIOD OF INTERNAL TENSION WITHIN 
SAUDI ARABIA AS FORCES GATHERED AROUND EITHER KING SAUD 
OR PRINCE FAISAL.  IT WAS SIGNIFICANT THAT FAISAL GOT THE 
KEY TO JEDDAH, SOMETHING HE DID NOT FORGET AFTER SAUD WAS 
FORCED TO ABDICATE.  FURTHERMORE, WHEN FAISAL BECAME KING 
HE DECIDED TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF NASSERISM HEAD ON. 
HE BEGAN TO CREATE THE FIRST MODERN SAUDI ARMY.  HE 
CALLED FOR AN ISLAMIC CONFERENCE WHICH WAS INTENDED TO 
CONFRONT ARAB NATIONALISM WITH ISLAM AND WHICH EVENTUALLY 
LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 
ISLAMIC CONFERENCE.  HE FUNDED THE ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT 
BANK AND HE SENT MOHAMMAD ABDULLAH ALIREZA TO CAIRO AS 
HIS AMBASSADOR. 
 
11.  MOHAMMAD SPENT SEVEN DIFFICULT YEARS IN EGYPT WHERE 
HE OFTEN FELT THREATENED AND ISOLATED.  ACCORDING TO HIS 
SON, FORMER SAUDI DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ABDULLAH 
ALIREZA, ONE OF THE FEW OFFICIALS WHO WOULD CALL ON HIS 
FATHER WAS THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR LUCIUS BATTLE. 
NEVERTHELESS, MOHAMMAD MADE PROGRESS IN NORMALIZING 
SAUDI-EGYPTIAN RELATION, NEGOTIATING THE TREATY OF JEDDAH 
AND ARRANGING THE WITHDRAWL OF EGYPTIAN TROOPS FROM YEMEN 
WHICH THE SAUDIS, NOT SURPRISINGLY, PAID FOR.  AS A 
REWARD FOR HIS LONG SERVICE, MOHAMMAD MOVED ON TO BECOME 
SAUDI AMBASSADOR TO PARIS WHERE HE HAD SPENT PART OF HIS 
YOUTH WORKING IN HIS COUSIN MOHAMMAD ALI\'S JEWELRY 
BUSINESS. 
 
12.  AFTER THE DEATH OF ABDULLAH ALIREZA\'S SONS, 
MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS MOVED ON TO THE GRANDSONS OF 
ZAINAL.  SHAIKH AHMED YUSSEF ZAINAL IS THE CURRENT HEAD 
OF THE FAMILY.  NOW NEARLY 70, AHMED IS ONE OF THE LAST 
ALIREZAS TO HAVE SPENT MUCH OF HIS YOUTH IN INDIA WHERE 
AFTER INDEPENDENCE PROHIBITIONS AGAINST FOREIGN OWNERSHIP 
FORCED THE FAMILY TO LIQUIDATE ITS HOLDINGS.  AHMED ALSO 
MADE FREQUENT VISITS TO JERUSALEM DURING THE THIRTIES 
WHERE HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE DIAMOND TRADE AND DEVELOPED 
A DEEP AND OFTEN EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THE PLIGHT OF THE 
PALESTINIANS. 
 
13.  WHILE THE FAMILY\'S BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS HAVE 
BECOME VARIED AND COMPLEX, ITS ASTUTE COMBINATION OF 
BUSINESS AND POLITICS HAS REMAINED CONSTANT.  LAST FALL 
AFTER THE INVASION OF KUWAIT, BUT BEFORE OPERATION DESERT 
STORM, THE ALIREZAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO BUILD A 200 
MILLION DOLLAR SODA ASH PLANT IN SAUDI ARABIA.  THIS WAS 
THEIR FIRST SIGNIFICANT NEW DOMESTIC INVESTMENT IN OVER 
FIVE YEARS.  WHILE THE PROJECT HAD BEEN UNDER 
CONSIDERATION FOR MONTHS, THE TIMING OF ITS ANNOUNCEMENT 
WAS INTENDED TO EXPRESS CONFIDENCE IN SAUDI ARABIA\'S 
LEADERSHIP AND FUTURE.  THE ALIREZAS\' OWN LEADERSHIP AND 
FUTURE WILL BE DEALT WITH IN A SECOND CABLE.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  THE AWAKENING, OR \"AS-SAHWAH\" AS IT IS KNOWN IN 
ARABIC, IS THE GENERAL TERM USED TO DESCRIBE THE 
CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS TREND WHICH GAINED STRENGTH IN 
SAUDI ARABIA FOLLOWING OPERATION DESERT STORM.  IT HAS 
REMAINED A LOOSELY STRUCTURED MOVEMENT WITHOUT FORMAL 
ORGANIZATION OR A LEADERSHIP HIERARCHY.  POL/ECON OFFICER 
RECENTLY ASKED TWO YOUNG SHARI\'A COURT LAWYERS FOR THEIR 
LIST OF THE AWAKENING\'S MOST IMPORTANT LEADERS.  WHILE 
TRAINED AT MAKKAH\'S UM AL-QURA ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, THESE 
TWO CONTACTS WOULD NOT DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS RELIGIOUS 
ACTIVISTS. 
 
3.  OUR CONTACTS CHARACTERIZED THOSE THEY NAMED AS THE 
MOST INFLUENTIAL \"RADICAL SALAFIYEEN\".  \"SALAFIYEEN\" IS A 
TERM WHICH DESCRIBES THOSE WHO WISH TO RETURN TO THE WAYS 
OF THEIR ANCESTORS.  AS USED BY OUR CONTACTS, IT HAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SALAFIYYAH MOVEMENT FOUNDED BY 
JAMAL AL-DIN AL-AFGHANI AND MOHAMMAD ABDUH IN EGYPT AT 
THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.  WE HAVE TRANSLATED IT AS 
\"REFORMERS\" SINCE THE ARABIC LACKS THE NEGATIVE 
CONNOTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH REACTIONARIES.  THESE 
REFORMERS ARE REPORTEDLY MOSTLY YOUNG, INTERESTED IN 
CURRENT EVENTS AND MORE STRICT IN THEIR RELIGIOUS 
INTERPRETATIONS THAN TRADITIONAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS SUCH 
AS ABDULAZIZ BIN BAZ.  THOSE WHO PREACH ARE REPORTEDLY 
WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR \"FIERY SERMONS\". 
 
4.  THE LIST OUR CONTACTS PROVIDED IS INTERESTING FOR 
SEVERAL REASONS.  FIRST, THEY PROVIDED 16 NAMES, WITH BIO 
DATA FOR EACH, DIRECTLY FROM THEIR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. 
THUS, WHILE THESE RELIGIOUS ACTIVISTS MAY NOT BE 
HOUSEHOLD NAMES, THEY FORM A WELL KNOWN AND RECOGNIZABLE 
GROUP IN THE MINDS OF THESE TWO LAWYERS.  MOST ARE ON THE 
FACULTIES OF THE KINGDOM\'S RELIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES, 
PARTICULARLY IN RIYADH.  NONE ARE FROM THE EASTERN 
PROVINCE.  MOST OF THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECENT 
\"COMMITTEE FOR THE DEFENSE OF LEGITIMATE RIGHTS\", 
INCLUDING ITS SIX FOUNDERS, WERE NOT MENTIONED. 
 
5.  MANY, BUT NOT ALL, OF THOSE NAMED SIGNED LAST YEAR\'S 
MEMORANDUM OF ADVICE (MOA) TO THE KING.  THE MEMORANDUM 
OF ADVICE OUTLINED PROPOSALS FOR A MORE ISLAMICLY CORRECT 
SAUDI ARABIA AND IS THE CLOSEST THING THE AWAKENING HAS 
PRODUCED TO A MANIFESTO.  NOT SIGNING IT, HOWEVER, DOES 
NOT APPEAR TO EXCLUDE ONE FROM BEING CONSIDERED AN 
IMPORTANT RELIGIOUS REFORMER. 
 
6.  FINALLY AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS LENGTHY 
LIST AND OUR CONTACTS\' RELATED COMMENTS INDICATE THAT THE 
AWAKENING HAS NOT YET PRODUCED A SINGLE, RECOGNIZED 
NATIONAL LEADER.  THERE IS NO SAUDI KHOMEINI. 
 
7.  THE LIST OF RELIGIOUS REFORMERS FOLLOWS:

SUMMARY

2.  (C) SHEIKH BAKR BIN LADEN TOLD THE AMBASSAD0R THAT HIS 
HALF-BR0THER USAMA WAS A SIMPLE PERS0N EASILY INFLUENCED 
BY OTHERS.  HE LEFT THE FAMILY BUSINESSES AB0UT TEN YEARS 
AG0 AFTER A DISPUTE 0VER WORKING WITH BANKS AND M0VED TO 
AFGHANISTAN, WHERE HE WAS \"BRAINWASHED\" BY EXTREMIST 
EGYPTIANS.  HE MAINTAINS N0 FINANCIAL LINKS T0 THE BIN 
LADENS AND, ACC0RDING T0 BAKR, LIVED OFF OF LITTLE M0NEY 
WHILE IN THE SUDAN BEYOND WHAT HE C0ULD EARN FR0M PR0JECTS 
DIRECTED HIS WAY BY THE G0VERNMENT.  N0W THAT HE HAS 
RETURNED T0 AFGHANISTAN, USAMA IS NEAR THE END 0F THE 
ROAD, FELT BAKR.  HE RECENTLY SENT WORD T0 HIS FAMILY THAT 
HE WAS WILLING T0 RETURN T0 SAUDI ARABIA, IF THE BIN 
LADENS W0ULD HELP SEEK THE RELEASE 0F CERTAIN P0LITICAL 
PRIS0NERS.  THE FAMILY REFUSED.  \"HE IS FINISHED,\" BAKR 
SAID.   END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
A PERSON 0PEN T0 SUGGESTI0N 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) IN A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR ON SEPTEMBER 17, 
SHEIKH BAKR BIN LADEN, CHAIRMAN OF THE SAUDI BIN LADEN 
GROUP, DISC0URSED FREELY AB0UT HI8 N0T0RI0US HALF-BR0THER 
USAMA.  BAKR COMMENTED THAT AB0UT HALF OF HIS FATHER\'8 
FIFTY-FOUR CHILDREN 8TUDIED ABR0AD.  TH0SE THAT REMAINED 
IN SAUDI ARABIA TEND T0 HAVE A MORE C0NSERVATIVE 0UTL00K 
0N LIFE;  USAMA WAS 0NE 0F THESE. 
 
4.  (C) USAMA\'S M0THER IS SYRIAN.  HE I8 THE 0NLY CHILD 
SHE BORE DURING HER MARRIAGE WITH M0HAMMED BIN LADEN 
(ALTHOUGH SHE HAD 0THER CHILDREN BY A PREVIOUS MARRIAGE). 
BAKR C0NSIDERED USAMA T0 BE A SIMPLE THINKER EASILY 
INFLUENCED BY THE IDEAS 0F 0THERS.  THIS MADE HIM 
SUSCEPTIBLE T0 EXTREMIST RELIGI0US IDEA8, WHICH BAKR 
TH0UGHT HAD BEEN SPREAD AM0NG THE SAUDI PE0PLE BY \"F0REIGN 
AGENTS\". 
 
5.  (C) THE BIN LADEN FAMILY LEARNED THAT U8AMA WAS 
PICKING UP UNUSUAL IDEAS ABOUT TEN YEARS AG0 WHILE HE 
STILL WORKED IN 0NE 0F THE FAMILY BUSINESSES.  AT THAT 
TIME HE PROTESTED TO 0NE OF HIS BROTHERS AB0UT THE BIN 
LADEN\'S DEALINGS WITH BANKS, WHICH USAMA C0NSIDERED T0 BE 
UN-ISLAMIC.  THE BR0THER DISMISSED HIS C0MPLAINTS, S0 
USAMA LEFT THE C0MPANY AND M0VED TO AFGHANISTAN. 
 
6.  (C) BAKR NOTED THAT USAMA HAD FREQUENTLY VI8ITED 
AFGHANISTAN EVEN BEF0RE HI8 M0VE.  THERE HE J0INED UP WITH 
EGYPTIAN EXTREMISTS, WH0 \"BRAINWA8HED\" HIM AND INTR0DUCED 
HIM T0 THE TACTICS 0F TERR0RI8M.  BAKR FELT THAT THESE 
EXTREMISTS WERE ONLY INTERESTED IN HIS HALF-BR0THER 
BECAUSE HE BEARS THE PRESTIGI0U8 BIN LADEN NAME. 
 
------------------------------------- 
N0 FINANCIAL TIES WITH THE BIN LADEN8 
------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) THE AMBASSAD0R A8KED WHETHER USAMA C0NTINUED T0 
MAINTAIN FINANCIAL LINKS T0 THE BIN LADENS.  USAMA HAD N0 
STAKE IN THE SAUDI BIN LADEN GR0UP (THE C0MPANY 
ESTABLISHED BY THE S0NS 0F M0HAMMED BIN LADEN) BAKR 
REPLIED.  HE D0E8 HAVE THE RIGHT T0 A SHARE IN HIS 
FATHER\'S BUSINESS, THE MOHAMMED BIN LADEN C0MPANY, BUT 
ONLY IF HE RETURNS T0 THE KINGD0M.  H0WEVER USAMA\'S LIQUID 
ASSETS WERE FR0ZEN BY THE SAUDI G0VERNMENT WHEN THEY 
STRIPPED HIM OF HIS CITIZENSHIP. 
 
8.  (C) BAKR CLAIMED THAT USAMA HAD LITTLE M0NEY WHILE 
LIVING IN SUDAN.  THE SUDANI GOVERNMENT 8UPP0RTED HIM BY 
PASSING R0AD CONSTRUCTION AND FARMING PROJECTS HI8 WAY. 
BAKR ALS0 SUSPECTED THAT IRAN FUNNELED M0NEY T0 HIM 
THR0UGH MIDDLEMEN, 8INCE USAMA W0ULD N0T 0PENLY MAINTAIN 
TIES WITH A SHIA G0VERNMENT. 
 
9.  (C) ACCORDING TO BAKR, INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE AND 
INTEREST IN BETTER COMMERCIAL RELATI0NS WITH SAUDI ARABIA 
C0MPELLED SUDAN T0 ASK USAMA T0 LEAVE.  HIS RETURN T0 
AFGHANISTAN HAS MADE HIM VULNERABLE, BAKR TH0UGHT;  USAMA 
I8 N0 LONGER PROTECTED BY THE SUDANI GOVERNMENT AND CAN 
N0W BE REACHED BY HIS ENEMIES.  \"HE IS FINISHED,\" BAKR 
SAID. 
 
-------------------------- 
N0 C0NTACT WITH THE FAMILY 
-------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) IN RESP0NSE T0 A QUESTI0N FR0M THE AMBASSAD0R, 
BAKR STATED THAT THE BIN LADENS ARE N0 L0NGER IS IN DIRECT 
C0NTACT WITH USAMA.  IN THE PAST HE COMMUNICATED WITH HIS 
M0THER DURING HER FREQUENT STAYS IN SYRIA.  THE FAMILY 
LAST ATTEMPTED T0 REAS0N WITH HIM THR0UGH A 90-YEAR-0LD 
UNCLE RESIDING IN MEDINA. 
 
11.  (C) BAKR TH0UGHT THAT USAMA WAS APPROACHING THE END 
OF THE ROAD.  HE HAD RECENTLY SENT WORD TO THE FAMILY 0F 
HIS WILLINGNESS TO RETURN T0 SAUDI ARABIA, ON C0NDITION 
THAT THE BIN LADENS HELP OBTAIN THE FREED0M 0F CERTAIN 
POLITICAL PRIS0NERS IN THE KINGDOM.  BAKR SAID THAT THE 
FAMILY REJECTED THIS REQUEST.

C0MMENT

12.  (C) BAKR HAS NEVER BEF0RE SPOKEN S0 FREELY WITH A USG 
0FFICIAL AB0UT HIS INFAM0US HALF-BR0THER; WHENEVER THE 
C0NVERSATI0N STRAYED, HE BROUGHT IT BACK T0 USAMA.  IN 
THIS FIRST MEETING WITH THE AMBASSAD0R, BAKR APPEARED T0 
BE TAKING PAINS TO DEM0NSTRATE THAT USAMA, WITH NO FULL 
BIN LADEN BR0THERS OR FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE SAUDI BIN 
LADEN GR0UP, REMAINED AN ISOLATED FIGURE IN HIS FAMILY.

REASON 1.5 (D). 
 
2.  (C)  SUMMARY: DURING RECENT VISIT BY RIYADH 
POLCOUNS, JEDDAH POLITICAL SCIENTISTS AND JOURNALISTS 
VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSED ROYAL JOCKEYING FOR POWER AND THE 
CROWN PRINCE\'S ROLE AND PROSPECTS.  LIKE SO MANY 
SAUDIS, MOST SEE HIM AS THE COUNTRY\'S GREAT HOPE, A 
GOOD MAN WHO WILL DEAL WITH INCREASINGLY PRESSING 
PROBLEMS.  MANY SEE THE JOCKEYING FOR POWER BETWEEN 
KING FAHD\'S SUDAYRI BROTHERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THE 
CROWN PRINCE AS ON-GOING AND BYZANTINE. ONE VOCAL 
OBSERVER ARGUED THAT CP ABDULLAH WILL BE BLOCKED AT 
EVERY TURN AND MAY NOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE OR EVEN, PERHAPS, LONG ENOUGH TO BE KING. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C)  OVER DINNER CG HOSTED FOR JEDDAH POLITICAL 
SCIENCE PROFESSORS AND AN OUTSPOKEN ECONOMIST WHO IS A 
TV PERSONALITY, AND IN MEETINGS WITH OTHER SAUDI 
POLITICAL OBSERVERS IN JEDDAH, INCLUDING TWO TOP SAUDI 
JOURNALISTS, VISITING RIYADH POLCOUNS GOT AN EARFUL OF 
VIEWS, RUMORS AND SPECULATION ON THE CROWN PRINCE, 
HIS FUTURE AND HIS CRITICAL ROLE IN DEALING WITH \'HE 
COUNTRY\'S MOUNTING ILLS.  WE REPORT THESE NOT BECAUSE 
THEY ARE NECESSARILY INSIDERS\' VIEWS OF WHAT IS GOING 
ON AT THE TOP, BUT BECAUSE THESE INTERLOCUTORS ARE THE 
SAUDI VERSION OF POLITICAL OBSERVERS IN THIS HIGHLY 
CONTROLLED SOCIETY AND BECAUSE WE SUSPECT THEIR VIEWS 
REFLECT THOSE OF A MUCH WIDER EDUCATED SAUDI AUDIENCE 
ABOUT THE CROWN PRINCE, HIS PROSPECTS, AND THE 
CHALLENGES HE FACES. 
 
 
IMPRESSIONS OF THE CROWN PRINCE DURING HIS TRIP 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  (S)  A NUMBER OF THESE JEDDAH OBSERVERS TOLD CG, 
RIYADH POLCOUNS, AND POLECONOFF THAT THEY HAD HEARD 
THAT AMERICANS DID NOT HAVE A POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF 
CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH BEFORE HIS TRIP TO THE U.S. 
POLCOUNS DENIED THIS, SAYING THAT THE CROWN PRINCE MADE 
A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION IN THE U.S. DURING HIS TRIP, 
INCLUDING VERY SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT, 
THE VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE.  ARAB 
NEWS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AND GADFLY KHALED AL-MAEENA, WHO 
ACCOMPANIED THE CROWN PRINCE THROUGHOUT HIS WORLD TRIP, 
NOTED THAT THE CROWN PRINCE ADMITTED OPENLY THAT HE WAS 
A SALESMAN FOR HIS COUNTRY--A BIG CHANGE FOR ABDULLAH. 
AL-MAEENA SAID THE CROWN PRINCE WAS VERY BUSINESSLIKE 
THROUGHOUT THE TRIP. WHILE HE DELIGHTED IN VISITING 
SHOPPING MALLS DURING HIS STAY IN HAWAII, HE ALSO KEPT 
HIS ADVISORS BUSY WRITING BRIEFING PAPERS IN 
PREPARATION FOR THE ASIAN PART OF HIS TRIP. 
 
 
LONGEVITY OF THE KING - AND THE CROWN PRINCE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (S)  IN LIVELY AND AT TIMES HEATED DISCUSSION AT 
THE CG\'S RESIDENCE, FOUR SAUDI POLITICAL SCIENTISTS AND 
ONE ECONOMIST SPECULATED ON THE CROWN PRINCE\'S CHANCES 
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN DEALING WITH SAUDI ARABIA\'S 
MOUNTING PROBLEMS. MOST FELT THAT ABDULLAH IS IN 
EXCELLENT PHYSICAL SHAPE FOR A MAN HIS AGE AND HAS A 
GOOD CHANCE FOR A LONG TENURE IN OFFICE, DURING WHICH 
HE CAN MAKE THE NECESSARY REFORMS WHICH WILL LEAD THE 
KINGDOM INTO THE NEXT CENTURY.  THE SOLE ECONOMIST, 
ALSO A TV COMMENTATOR, ARGUED VIGOROUSLY AND SOMETIMES 
BELLIGERENTLY THAT KING FAHD MAY CONTINUE TO REIGN (BUT 
NOT RULE) FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS WITH THE HELP OF MODERN 
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, AND THAT EVEN IF ABDULLAH BECOMES 
KING, HE MAY ONLY HAVE A THREE TO FOUR YEAR TENURE--NOT 
ENOUGH TO ENACT SUBSTANTIVE REFORMS. 
 
 
KEEPING THE KING AROUND 
----------------------- 
 
6. (S) IN SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS BOTH AL-MAEENA AND A 
RETIRED SENIOR SAUDI OFFICIAL TOLD US THAT IT WAS KING 
FAHD\'S SUDAYRI BROTHERS AND HIS IN-LAWS (THE HIGHLY 
CORRUPT IBRAHIMS) WHO CONVINCED KING FAHD NOT TO RETIRE 
AFTER HE HAD HANDED OVER POWER TO CP ABDULLAH AFTER HIS 
STROKE.  AL-MAEENA CLAIMED THAT NOT LONG AGO FAHD AGAIN 
WANTED TO ABDICATE BUT THE CLOSE FAMILY AROUND HIM 
ENSURED THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. 
 
 
STRONG RULER OR \"RUBBER STAMP\"? 
------------------------------- 
 
7.  (S)  MOST OF THESE POLITICAL OBSERVERS TOLD US 
ABDULLAH IS A STRONG RULER WHO IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, 
WILL REIGN IN THE MUTAWWA, CRACK DOWN ON EXCESSES, AND 
BRING THE COUNTRY INTO THE 21ST CENTURY.  ECHOING WHAT 
WE HAVE WIDELY HEARD, ONE OBSERVER SAID THE CROWN 
PRINCE COMMANDS RESPECT THAT FAHD DOES NOT.  THE 
RETIRED SENIOR OFFICIAL WAS UPBEAT ON THE CROWN 
PRINCE\'S POTENTIAL, AND PREDICTED THAT ABDULLAH WILL 
GIVE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO DRIVE.  ON SUCCESSION, HE 
DISCOUNTED REPORTS OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHO WILL BE 
ABDULLAH\'S CROWN PRINCE, SAYING IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE 
PRINCE SULTAN. 
 
8.  (S)  THE ECONOMIST/TV COMMENTATOR WAS ADAMANT IN 
CALLING ABDULLAH A \"RUBBER STAMP,\" CONTENDING THE CROWN 
PRINCE DOES NOT MAKE DECISIONS ON HIS OWN BUT IS MOSTLY 
CARRYING OUT THE ADVICE OF HIS CONSULTANTS. FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE ECONOMIST ASSERTED THAT ABDULLAH\'S 
WASHINGTON ENERGY INITIATIVE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HIS 
OWN IDEA, SINCE HE LACKED TECHNICAL COMMAND OF THE 
ISSUE. TYING IN WITH THIS LINE OF REASONING, OTHER 
JEDDAH OBSERVERS CLAIMED THAT SENIOR PALACE OFFICIALS 
NOWAISSER AND ANGARI NOW PLAY A KEY ROLE IN POLICY 
MAKING AND THAT THEY OFTEN CARRY OUT THE DESIRES OF 
FAHD\'S CLOSE BLOOD RELATIVES AND IN-LAWS. 
 
 
ALLIES AND ENEMIES 
------------------ 
 
9. (S)  MOST OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS FELT THAT FOREIGN 
MINISTER SAUD AL-FAISAL IS A STRONG ALLY OF THE CROWN 
PRINCE ABDULLAH; ABDULLAH TRUSTS SAUD AL-FAISAL, AND 
CONSULTS WITH HIM ON FOREIGN POLICY AND OTHER MATTERS. 
THEY SAID SAUD WOULD PROBABLY LEAVE THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY AND BECOME A ROYAL ADVISER WHEN ABDULLAH 
BECOMES KING.  THE SUDAYRI FAMILY, IN THE EYES OF THESE 
OBSERVERS, ARE MANIPULATING ABDULLAH, AND ARE VYING FOR 
POWER BEHIND THE SCENES.  ONE COMMENTATOR SAID THAT 
PRINCE NAIF IS OBSESSED WITH SECURITY, PRINCE SALMAN 
HAS HIS OWN SPIES, AND EVERYONE IN THE PALACE IS SPYING 
ON EACH OTHER.  (ACCORDING TO THIS OBSERVER, AMBASSADOR 
TO THE U.S. PRINCE BANDAR BIN SULTAN IS CALLED 
\"AMERICA\'S MAN\", VIEWED AS A PURVEYOR FOR U.S. 
INTERESTS, AND VERY HATED HERE AND BY THE ROYAL FAMILY. 
THIS OBSERVER ALSO TERMED BANDAR A \"BLACK MONKEY\" WHO 
WOULD NEVER BECOME KING BECAUSE OF HIS SLAVE MOTHER.) 
 
FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGE 
------------------------ 
 
10.  (S)  THE CROWN PRINCE, ACCORDING TO JAMAL AL- 
KHASHOGGI, POLITICAL COLUMNIST FOR AL-HAYAT NEWSPAPER, 
FACES A DAUNTING FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGE IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST.  THE KINGDOM CANNOT DEPEND ON SYRIA, AND IRAQ IS 
NOT A FRIEND: IT IS HARD TO BUILD A COALITION IN THE 
ARAB WORLD TO BALANCE THE POWER OF THE ISRAELIS AND THE 
U.S.  THE CROWN PRINCE IS NOT HAPPY WITH THE CURRENT 
SITUATION IN THE ARAB WORLD: HE NEEDS STRONG NEIGHBORS, 
BUT EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA CANNOT FLY ALONE. 
 
11.  (S)  COMMENT/CONCLUSION: THE CROWN PRINCE HAS BOTH 
ADMIRERS AND CRITICS AMONG JEDDAH POLITICAL OBSERVERS, 
WHO ARE BRUTALLY FRANK ABOUT THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE 
GRIM STATE OF SAUDI SOCIETY (SEPTEL) AND THE DAUNTING 
CHALLENGES ABDULLAH FACES. ALL FELT THAT THE DECISION 
PROCESS IN THE KINGDOM CRIES OUT FOR REFORMS, THAT IT 
IS FAR TOO SLOW, CUMBERSOME AND OPAQUE. ONE JOURNALIST 
ARGUED THAT THE KINGDOM NEEDS A WHITE REVOLUTION, 
SIMILAR TO THAT OCCURRING NOW IN QATAR, WITH SOMEONE 
FROM THE ROYAL FAMILY CHANGING LAWS AND THE ENTIRE 
SYSTEM.  MOST OBSERVERS IN JEDDAH HOPE THAT SOMEONE 
WILL BE CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH.  WE DOUBT, HOWEVER, THAT 
EVEN IF HE DOES COME TO POWER SOON, HE CAN MEET EVEN 
MOST OF THEIR EXPECTATIONS.

CLASSIFIED BY: ACTING CONSUL GENERAL CHARLES RICHE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
1.  (C) ON APRIL 2, POLOFF MET WITH A LOCAL SAUDI LAWYER, DR. 
BASIM ALIM (STRICTLY PROTECT), TO DISCUSS HIS OPEN LETTER TO 
CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH CALLING FOR REFORM.  A \"SELF-MADE\" 
LAWYER, ALIM WAS CHOSEN IN DECEMBER 2002 TO REPRESENT SEVERAL 
SAUDI CHARITIES IN THE SEPTEMBER 11 LAWSUIT AND ADMITS THAT 
HE IS LABELED AN ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST BY MANY.  ALIM SAID 
THAT THE U.S. IS BACKING THE WRONG HORSE (REFERRING TO THE AL 
SAUD), AND THAT AMERICA SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THE PEOPLE. 
DURING THE MEETING, ALIM AND AN ASSOCIATE OF HIS DESCRIBED 
SAUDI SOCIETY AS \"AT A BOILING POINT\" WARNING THAT \"THE 
TABLES WILL TURN, AND WHEN THEY DO, IT WILL HAPPEN QUICKLY, 
AND THE U.S. WILL BE ON THE WRONG SIDE.\"  ALIM SAID THAT 
THERE ARE PRESENTLY TWO VERY DANGEROUS TRENDS IN THE COUNTRY; 
1) SAUDIS ARE SKEPTICAL AND QUESTIONING THE MOTIVES AND 
STATEMENTS OF THEIR GOVERNMENT, AND 2) THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
BECOME AMBIVALENT TO WHETHER THE AL SAUD STAYS OR GOES.  ALIM 
CONTENDS THAT PRESSURE FROM THE OUTSIDE IS STARTING TO HAVE 
AN IMPACT ON THE AL SAUD, CITING THE RELEASE OF LEADING 
POLITICAL DISSIDENT SHAYKH SAEED BIN ZA\'ER AS AN EXAMPLE (SEE 
REFTEL).  THE TWO MEN ARGUE THAT IT IS NOT TOO LATE FOR THE 
U.S. TO TURN THE TIDE OF ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT IF THE U.S. 
BETS ON THE PEOPLE. 
 
2.  (C) WHILE THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE TWO MEN ARE NOT 
ENTIRELY NEW, THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF HOW OUT OF TOUCH THE AL 
SAUD ARE WITH THEIR PEOPLE AND HOW THE U.S. CAN WIN BACK THE 
HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE ARABS ARE WORTH NOTING.  MORE THAN 
ANYTHING, HOWEVER, THE MEETING HIGHLIGHTED THE DICHOTOMY THAT 
ARISES WHEN DISCUSSING REFORM WITH HEJAZIS.  WHILE SOME ARGUE 
THAT THE U.S. IS INTERFERING TOO MUCH WITH THE SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT BY PRESSURING THEM TO REFORM, OTHERS ARGUE FOR 
GREATER INTERFERENCE, AND STILL OTHERS SOMEHOW ARGUE FOR 
BOTH.  WE GET ONLY SLIPPERY ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT 
THE \"GRASSROOTS\" WANTS, IS WILLING TO ACCEPT, AND WHO CAN 
MAKE IT HAPPEN.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
 
BET ON THE PEOPLE, LOOSEN YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE AL SAUD 
 
3.  (C) ON APRIL 2, POLOFF MET WITH DR. BASIM ALIM (STRICTLY 
PROTECT), A \"SELF-MADE LAWYER,\" TO DISCUSS HIS RECENTLY 
PUBLISHED LETTER ADDRESSED TO CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH CALLING 
FOR REFORM.  (NOTE: IN DECEMBER, 2002, ALIM WAS CHOSEN TO 
REPRESENT SEVERAL SAUDI CHARITIES IN THE SEPTEMBER 11 LAWSUIT 
AND ADMITS THAT MANY PEOPLE LABEL HIM AS AN ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST.  END NOTE.)  THE MEETING WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY 
DR. WALED FATEIHI (STRICTLY PROTECT), A U.S. EDUCATED 
PHYSICIAN AND CLOSE FRIEND OF ALIM.  ALIM, WHILE OPEN TO 
DISCUSSING HIS ARTICLE, TOOK MORE INTEREST IN CONVEYING THE 
MESSAGE THAT THE USG NEEDS TO HALT ITS SUPPORT FOR 
GOVERNMENTS THAT GO AGAINST THE PRINCIPLES OF THE U.S. 
CONSTITUTION.  HE BELIEVES THAT THE U.S. IS ACTING AS AN 
ENABLER TO THESE DESPOTIC REGIMES IN THE REGION, WHICH 
ULTIMATELY BREEDS RESENTMENT FROM THE PEOPLE.  HE CONTENDS 
THAT THE AL SAUD HAVE BECOME TOO DEPENDENT ON THE U.S. AND AS 
A RESULT DON\'T ALWAYS HAVE THE PEOPLES\' BEST INTEREST AT 
HEART.  LIKE MANY, ALIM DOES NOT MIND A LIMITED MONARCHY, 
STATING \"THEY CAN HAVE THEIR KING, AND APPOINT A FEW PRINCES, 
BUT THAT\'S IT.  THE POWER NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE.\" 
 
4.  (C) ALIM CONTENDS THAT PRESSURE FROM THE OUTSIDE IS 
STARTING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE AL SAUD, CITING THE RELEASE 
OF LEADING POLITICAL DISSIDENT SHAYKH SAEED BIN ZA\'ER AS AN 
EXAMPLE (SEE REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO ALIM, MIRA, (THE SAUDI 
OPPOSITION GROUP IN LONDON), THREATENED TO FILE A LAWSUIT 
AGAINST THE AL SAUD IN BELGIUM (NFI), AND WHEN THE AL SAUD 
FOUND OUT ABOUT IT, THEY RELEASED AL ZA\'ER.  ALIM BELIEVES 
THAT REFORM PETITIONS AND LETTERS LIKE HIS WOULD CARRY 
GREATER WEIGHT IF THERE WAS MORE PRESSURE ON THE AL SAUD.  HE 
EVEN WENT AS FAR AS TO SUGGEST THAT THE U.S. CONSIDER PLACING 
SANCTIONS ON THE KINGDOM. 
 
5.  (C) ALIM AND FATEIHI BELIEVE THAT IN ANY SOCIETY, FIVE 
PERCENT OF POPULATION, \"THE INTELLIGENTSIA\", FORCE THE SYSTEM 
ARGUE THAT THEY CAN DO IT BUT THEY NEED THE U.S. TO \"SUPPORT 
THE PEOPLE, AND TO BET ON THE PEOPLE.  WE HAVE OUR OWN BEN 
FRANKLINS AND JOHN HANCOCKS, BUT YOU NEED TO GIVE US A CHANCE.\" 
FATEIHI URGED A REGIONAL CHANGE STATING THAT \"IF THE U.S. DOES 
NOT LOOK TO FORCE OTHER REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO CHANGE LIKE THE 
U.S. IS DOING IN IRAQ, IT WILL HAVE ALL BEEN FOR NOTHING.\" 
 
6.  (C) BOTH MEN, WHO HAVE SPENT DECADES IN THE STATES AS 
STUDENTS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS, ARE SADDENED BY THE 
ANTI-U.S. SENTIMENT THAT HAS ONLY GROWN OVER THE YEARS IN THE 
ARAB AND MUSLIM WORLD.  \"I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD GET TO 
THIS.  BUT IT IS NOT TOO LATE.  ARABS ARE VERY EMOTIONAL 
PEOPLE, AND IF YOU TAKE A STAND AGAINST THESE DESPOTIC 
GOVERNMENTS, THE PEOPLE WILL BE WITH YOU.\"  POLOFF, CITING 
THE INTERNAL RELIGIOUS AND TRADITIONAL STRIFE IN THE COUNTRY, 
ASKED IF THEY FELT CONFIDENT THAT THEY KNEW WHAT THE 
GRASSROOTS LEVEL WANTED, AND WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO GET \"THE 
REST TO FOLLOW.\"  WITHOUT PROVIDING DETAILS, THEY SAID THAT 
THEY KNEW WHAT THE GRASSROOTS WANTED AND KNEW WHAT THE 
ALLOWABLE PARAMETERS OF CHANGE WERE IN THE KINGDOM. 
 
 
EQUALITY AND DIGNITY. . . ALL ELEMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION 
 
7.  (C) RECALLING THEIR ADMIRATION FOR THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, 
ALIM AND FATEIHI ARGUED THAT WHAT SAUDIS REALLY WANT IS 
EQUALITY.  THEY WANT TO BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO SUCCEED AND WANT 
THEIR DIGNITY BACK.  ALIM SAID THAT \"THE AL SAUD HAVE 
SQUEEZED OUT THE LITTLE PEOPLE AND HAVE THEIR TENTACLES IN 
EVERYTHING.  UNDER EVERY STONE IS A PRINCE, AND THEY ARE OUT 
OF TOUCH WITH THEIR PEOPLE.\"  ALIM SAID THAT THERE ARE 
PRESENTLY TWO VERY DANGEROUS TRENDS IN THE COUNTRY; 1) SAUDIS 
ARE SKEPTICAL AND QUESTIONING THE MOTIVES AND STATEMENTS OF 
THEIR GOVERNMENT, AND 2) THAT PEOPLE HAVE BECOME AMBIVALENT 
TO WHETHER THE AL SAUD STAYS OR GOES. 
 
8.  (C) ALIM CRITICIZED A RECENT STATEMENT GIVEN BY PRINCE 
SULTAN WHOM HE REPORTED AS SAYING, \"EVEN SOMEONE FROM JIZAN 
CAN COME SEE ME.\"  ALIM FOUND THIS STATEMENT TO BE HIGHLY 
INSULTING, PARTICULARLY TO THE JIZANIS, BECAUSE IT INSINUATED 
THAT THEY ARE THE LOWEST OF THE LOW IN THE KINGDOM BUT STILL 
CAN CONSIDER THEMSELVES PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO MEET A POWERFUL 
PRINCE.  THEY WERE ALSO CRITICAL OF SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER 
SAUD AL-FAISAL DURING A RECENT PRESS BRIEFING.  APPARENTLY, A 
FEMALE SAUDI JOURNALIST ASKED THE FOREIGN MINISTER IF HE HAD 
SEEN THE DEPARTMENT\'S HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT.  ACCORDING TO THE 
TWO MEN, HE COMPLETELY DISMISSED HER AND JUST REPLIED QUITE 
TERSELY, \"NO.\"  THEY RESENT THAT SAUD AL-FAISAL WOULD BE SO 
SHORT WITH A SAUDI CITIZEN, AND INTERPRET IT AS AN 
INSINUATION FROM THE FM THAT SAUDIS SHOULD NOT BE CONCERNED 
WITH HUMAN RIGHTS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE QUESTION HAD 
COME FROM A WESTERN REPORTER, SAUD AL-FAISAL\'S RESPONSE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN HANDLED MUCH DIFFERENTLY, ACCORDING TO FATEIHI. 
(COMMENT:  POLOFF HAS RECENTLY HEARD CRITICISM REGARDING SAUD 
AL-FAISAL\'S PRESS CONFERENCES.  LOCAL JOURNALISTS PERCEIVE 
THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTER INCREASINGLY CATERS TO THE FOREIGN 
MEDIA AND TELLS THEM THAT THE SAG IS INTERESTED IN REFORM AND 
HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT DOES NOT TAKE THE SAME INTEREST IN 
DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES WITH LOCAL REPORTERS, AND SOMETIMES 
DELIVERS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MESSAGE ALL TOGETHER.  END 
COMMENT.) 
 
ALIM\'S IDEAS FOR REFORM 
 
9.  (U) HERE ARE VERBATIM EXCERPTS OF DR. ALIM\'S LETTER TO 
THE CROWN PRINCE THAT APPEARED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE DAILY, 
ARAB NEWS ON MARCH 23, 2003.  (NOTE: THE ARTICLE ORIGINALLY 
RAN IN THE ARABIC DAILY, AL MADINA. END NOTE.) 
 
BEGIN TEXT 
 
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS, 
AN UNJUST WAR HAS BEGUN AND THE KINGDOM MUST MOVE FROM A 
STATE OF INACTION TO ONE OF POSITIVE CONFRONTATION AGAINST 
ANY AGGRESSOR WHO VIOLATES THE SOVEREIGNTY AND SANCTITY OF 
COUNTRIES AND MURDERS OUR BRETHREN WHEREVER THEY ARE.  ON THE 
INTERNAL FRONT, WE HOPE TO SEE EACH INDIVIDUAL FASHIONED TO 
BECOME PART AND PARCEL OF HIS NATION, AWARE OF HIS 
SERVED BY HAILING AND PRAISING BUT FOUND IN THE HEARTS OF THE 
FAITHFUL AND THE SINCERE WORKING TO DELIVER THEIR COUNTRY AND 
NATION FROM ALL THREATS.  YOUR HIGHNESS, EVERY CITIZEN IS 
WILLING TO OFFER ALL THEY POSSESS, INCLUDING THEIR LIVES, IF 
THE CONVICTION IS CREATED INSIDE THEM THAT SINCERITY PREVAILS 
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.  EVERY INDIVIDUAL MUST SENSE THIS 
EQUALITY AS REALITY, WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION AND FAVORITISM 
FOR ANYONE, NO MATTER WHO THEY MIGHT BE.  IT IS TIME TO 
ENERGIZE AND ACTIVATE OUR CIVIL INSTITUTIONS SO THEY MAY PLAY 
A MORE SUPPORTIVE ROLE IN SERVING THE NATION\'S INTERESTS AND 
STIMULATING LEADERSHIP POLICIES.  THE CALL FOR INCORPORATING 
FREEDOM OF CHOICE, ACCOUNTABILITY, FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, 
INTELLECTUAL PLURALISM AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO PLAY 
A MORE ACTIVE ROLE, ALL THIS COMES WITHIN OUR RELIGIOUS 
TEACHINGS. 
 
10.  (U) YOUR HIGHNESS, OUR YOUTH NEED TO BE DIRECTED BY 
PLANTING IN THEM THE NOBLE CHARACTERS THAT THE PROPHET 
MUHAMMAD PEACE BE UPON HIM, SET FOR THE NATION\'S YOUTH.  THIS 
CAN BE DONE NOT ONLY THROUGH MILITARY SERVICE BUT THOUGH 
ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN COMMUNITY SERVICE.  I APPEAL TO YOUR 
HIGHNESS TO OPEN THE WAY FOR AN EXTENSIVE POPULAR EFFORT ON 
ALL FRONTS IN SUPPORT OF OUR NATION SO THAT IT WILL BE ABLE 
TO REPULSE THE RISKS DESCENDING ON IT FROM ALL SIDES.  WE 
HOPE YOU WILL REWARD THE HAND THAT IS BEING STRETCHED OUT IN 
UNITY SO THAT WE CAN STAND TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF DANGER.
