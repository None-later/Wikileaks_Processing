SUBJECT:  BIO REPORT: NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER JENNY SHIPLEY 
 
REF: (A) WELLINGTON 1498; (B) WELLINGTON 1492 
 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY:  JOSIAH H. BEEMAN, AMBASSADOR. 
REASONS: 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY: NZ\'S NEW (AND FIRST WOMAN) PRIME MINISTER JENNY 
SHIPLEY IS AN ASTUTE POLITICIAN WHO BELIEVES IN LESS GOVERNMENT, 
INDIVIDUAL EMPOWERMENT, AND A \"SOFT HEART AND A HARD HEAD.\"  SHE 
TAKES A MEASURED AND CONSULTATIVE APPROACH TO NEW ISSUES, BUT IS 
NOT AFRAID TO TAKE RISKS WHEN SHE FEELS CONDITIONS MERIT ACTION. 
A COMPLICATED PREGNANCY SPURRED SHIPLEY TO LEAVE THE FARM AND 
BEGIN A CAREER IN POLITICS IN 1978.  ENTERING PARLIAMENT IN 1987, 
SHE BEGAN A FAST RISE -- APPOINTED TO HER FIRST SHADOW CABINET 
POSITION ONLY SEVENTEEN MONTHS LATER.  ONCE IN GOVERNMENT IN 
1990, SHIPLEY INTRODUCED SWEEPING REFORMS IN SOCIAL WELFARE AND 
HEALTH WHILE MASTERING THESE TWO DIFFICULT MINISTERIAL 
PORTFOLIOS.  THE REFORMS EARNED HER THE PUBLIC\'S WRATH, BUT ALSO 
THE RESPECT OF HER PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES.  HER SUCCESSFUL 
CHALLENGE TO BOLGER\'S LEADERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL PARTY -- WELL- 
PLANNED, WELL-RESEARCHED, AND WELL-EXECUTED -- REFLECTS HER 
POLITICAL CAREER TO DATE.  A HARD-WORKING POLITICIAN, RUTHLESS OR 
PRAGMATIC AS NEEDED, SHIPLEY IS WELL-DISPOSED TOWARD THE U.S. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------- 
PARSON\'S DAUGHTER 
----------------- 
3.  (C)  JENNIFER MARY ROBSON WAS BORN FEBRUARY 4, 1952, IN GORE, 
ON NEW ZEALAND\'S SOUTH ISLAND.  SHE WAS THE SECOND OF FOUR 
DAUGHTERS BORN TO A PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER AND HIS WIFE.  THE 
FAMILY LIVED IN GORE AND THEN IN WELLINGTON FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER 
SHIPLEY\'S BIRTH UNTIL THEY SETTLED IN BLENHEIM (NEAR THE NORTH 
COAST OF THE SOUTH ISLAND), WHERE SHE SPENT THE BALANCE OF HER 
CHILDHOOD.  THE FAMILY WAS NOT WEALTHY AND HAD SOME DIFFICULTY 
MAKING ENDS MEET. 
 
4.  (C)  SHIPLEY STATES THAT HER CORE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY (\"A 
SOFT HEART AND A HARD HEAD\") WAS FORMULATED WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD, 
WATCHING HER FATHER TEND TO HIS CONGREGATION.  HIS APPROACH, SHE 
SAYS, WAS TO LEND A SYMPATHETIC EAR WHILE SHOWING PEOPLE HOW TO 
EMPOWER THEMSELVES; AND TO FOCUS ON THE CAUSE OF PROBLEMS, NOT 
THEIR SYMPTOMS. 
 
5.  (C)  SHIPLEY GREW INTO A TOMBOY AND A CHAMPIONSHIP SWIMMER 
(SHE TOOK UP SWIMMING TO HELP COMBAT CHILDHOOD ASTHMA).  AN 
UNDISTINGUISHED STUDENT (SHE BLAMES HER BAD GRADES ON HER LOVE 
FOR SWIMMING), SHE BARELY PASSED HER HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM AND 
FAILED HER UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAM.  (COMMENT: SHIPLEY\'S POOR 
ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND FAILURE TO PASS HER UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE 
EXAM PROBABLY INDICATED A LACK OF AMBITION RATHER THAN ABILITY 
AND A REALIZATION THAT, AT THE TIME, A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION WAS 
NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR SUCCESS.  END COMMENT)  AT 17, SHE MET 
BURTON SHIPLEY AND, TAKING THE INITIATIVE, ASKED HIM TO A BALL. 
(THE COUPLE DATED FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE GETTING MARRIED.)  AT 18, 
SHIPLEY\'S FATHER DIED UNEXPECTEDLY, AND HER MOTHER BEGAN TO LIVE 
ON A WIDOW\'S PENSION.  (AS SOCIAL WELFARE MINISTER MANY YEARS 
LATER, SHIPLEY WOULD OVERSEE LEGISLATION THAT REDUCED THIS 
BENEFIT.) 
 
-------------------------------- 
TRAUMATIC PREGNANCY SPURS CHANGE 
-------------------------------- 
6.  (C)  AFTER GRADUATING FROM CHRISTCHURCH TEACHERS COLLEGE IN 
1971, SHIPLEY BEGAN TO SETTLE INTO A FAIRLY CONVENTIONAL LIFE FOR 
A 19 YEAR OLD NEW ZEALAND WOMAN.  IN 1972, SHE BEGAN HER CAREER 
AS A PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHER IN A CHRISTCHURCH SUBURB.  SHE JOINED 
THE NATIONAL PARTY AND BECAME POLITICALLY ACTIVE, BUT IN CONTRAST 
TO HER PEERS, WHO BECAME ACTIVISTS BECAUSE OF VIETNAM, SHE 
FOCUSED HER ENERGIES ON COMMUNITY ISSUES (SPECIFICALLY, CHILD 
CARE ISSUES: MANDATORY FENCES AROUND POOLS AND CHILD SEAT 
RESTRAINTS).  AFTER MARRIAGE IN 1973, SHIPLEY SPENT THE NEXT 
THREE YEARS JUGGLING HER TEACHING CAREER, FAMILY FARM DUTIES, 
MARRIAGE AND INTEREST IN LOCAL POLITICS.  IN 1976, SHE DECIDED TO 
QUIT TEACHING TO RAISE A FAMILY.  THE COUPLE HAD A GIRL, ANNA, IN 
1977, AND A BOY, BEN, IN 1978. 
 
7.  (C)  SHIPLEY HAD SEVERE DIFFICULTIES DURING BEN\'S BIRTH, 
BEGAN TO HEMORRHAGE SHORTLY AFTER DELIVERY, AND WAS REPORTEDLY 
NEAR DEATH.  ALONG WITH THE PHYSICAL TRAUMA, SHE WENT THROUGH A 
PERIOD OF SEVERE POST-PARTUM DEPRESSION.  DURING HER 
CONVALESCENCE, SHIPLEY CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT SHE WOULD NOT 
BE CONTENT WITH HER LIFE AS IT WAS AND WOULD BE DOING A 
DISSERVICE TO HERSELF AND HER FAMILY IF SHE DID NOT MAKE A 
CHANGE.  MARRIAGE AND MOTHERHOOD, ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, BECAME 
A THREAT TO HER IDENTITY.  WITH BURTON\'S BLESSING, SHIPLEY BECAME 
MORE ACTIVE IN POLITICS AND MORE SERIOUS ABOUT A POLITICAL 
CAREER. 
 
8.  (C)  IN 1980, SHIPLEY MET HER PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATIVE, 
RUTH RICHARDSON, A NATIONAL PARTY FAST-RISING RIGHT-WING ECONOMIC 
RATIONALIST.  RICHARDSON, WHO ALSO HAD A FARMING BACKGROUND 
(ALBEIT A WEALTHY ONE), TOOK A SHINE TO SHIPLEY AND BECAME HER 
MENTOR AND GODFATHER.  RICHARDSON HELPED PAVE THE WAY FOR 
SHIPLEY\'S ELEVATION FROM A CAMPAIGN EXTRA TO ELECTED POSITIONS 
(THE MALVERN COUNTY COUNCIL AND THE NATIONAL PARTY\'S CANTERBURY- 
WESTLAND POLICY COMMITTEE).  IN 1984, SHIPLEY RETURNED THE FAVOR 
BY CAMPAIGNING HEAVILY FOR RICHARDSON\'S (SUCCESSFUL) RE-ELECTION. 
(ALTHOUGH SHIPLEY SHARES RICHARDSON\'S DISLIKE FOR THE WELFARE 
STATE AND PREFERENCE FOR MARKET-ORIENTED SOLUTIONS TO ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS, SHIPLEY\'S APPROACH IS LESS DOGMATIC AND SHE HAS BEEN 
CAREFUL TO CHART HER OWN COURSE.  AFTER SHIPLEY ENTERED 
PARLIAMENT, AND AS RICHARDSON\'S POLICIES AS AN OUTSPOKEN RADICAL 
REFORMIST FINANCE MINISTER BECAME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL, 
SHIPLEY BEGAN TO PUBLICLY DISTANCE HERSELF FROM HER MENTOR.  SHE 
IS NOW QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT SHE IS \"NOT A RICHARDSON CLONE.\") 
 
---------------------------- 
QUICK RISER IN OPPOSITION... 
---------------------------- 
9.  (C)  IN 1987, AT 35 YEARS OF AGE, SHIPLEY ANNOUNCED FOR AND 
WON THE MARGINAL RURAL SEAT OF ASHBURTON (LATER RENAMED RAKAIA). 
ALTHOUGH THE RETIRING NATIONAL INCUMBENT HAD HELD THE SEAT WITH A 
500 VOTE MAJORITY, SHIPLEY INCREASED THAT MARGIN TO 5,000 VOTES 
(THE BIGGEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE 1987 ELECTION FOR EITHER 
PARTY AND AN IMPRESSIVE DEBUT).  UPON HER ELECTION, BURTON SOLD 
THE FAMILY FARM AND BECAME A HOUSE-HUSBAND, WHILE SHIPLEY 
COMMUTED TO PARLIAMENT. 
 
10.  (C)  SHIPLEY BEGAN HER PARLIAMENTARY CAREER RANKED 38TH OUT 
OF 40 NATIONAL MPS, SERVING ON THE EDUCATION AND SCIENCE 
COMMITTEE.  SEVENTEEN MONTHS LATER, AFTER EXHIBITING THE HARD 
WORK AND THOROUGH RESEARCH THAT HAVE BECOME HER TRADEMARK, 
SHIPLEY WAS APPOINTED OPPOSITION ASSOCIATE SPOKESPERSON ON 
EDUCATION BY NATIONAL LEADER JIM BOLGER (LEAP-FROGGING NATIONAL\'S 
ENTIRE INTAKE OF MPS IN THE CLASS OF 1984).  A YEAR LATER, AT 39 
YEARS OF AGE, BOLGER APPOINTED SHIPLEY OPPOSITION SPOKESPERSON ON 
SOCIAL WELFARE, A JUMP TO 11TH PLACE IN NATIONAL PARTY RANKINGS. 
HER QUICK RISE BEGAN TO ATTRACT ATTENTION IN THE MEDIA, WHICH 
DUBBED HER \"MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
. . .THANKLESS GNZ PORTFOLIOS: SOCIAL WELFARE AND HEALTH 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
11.  (C)  UPON NATIONAL\'S ELECTION VICTORY IN 1990, SHIPLEY 
BECAME MINISTER FOR SOCIAL WELFARE (THE GOVERNMENT\'S LARGEST 
SPENDING PORTFOLIO) AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS.  IT WOULD 
BE THE FIRST OF TWO POLITICALLY THANKLESS PORTFOLIOS PM BOLGER 
WOULD HAND SHIPLEY (IN AN ATTEMPT BY BOLGER TO TEMPER HER 
METEORIC RISE, ACCORDING TO SOME OBSERVERS).  AS MINISTER FOR 
SOCIAL WELFARE, SHIPLEY PRESIDED OVER \"THE MOST EXTENSIVE REVAMP 
OF THE WELFARE STATE\" TO DATE.  SHE FIRST CAPPED THEN CUT WELFARE 
BENEFITS TO THE UNEMPLOYED, RETIREES AND WIDOWS BY AS MUCH AS 25 
PER CENT.  DURING THIS TIME, SHIPLEY DEVELOPED A REPUTATION FOR 
RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY AND, IN SOME EYES, BECAME THE HARD FACE OF AN 
UNCARING GOVERNMENT.  IN INSTITUTING DIFFICULT POLICY DECISIONS, 
SHE EARNED THE PUBLIC\'S IRE (SHE WAS BURNED IN EFFIGY SEVERAL 
TIMES), BUT ALSO ITS GRUDGING RESPECT AS WELL AS THE ADMIRATION 
OF HER PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES.  SHE ALSO DEVELOPED FINE 
DEBATING SKILLS, IN CONFRONTING LABOUR\'S THEN SOCIAL WELFARE 
SPOKESPERSON (AND CURRENT DEPUTY LEADER) MICHAEL CULLEN -- ONE OF 
LABOUR\'S SHARPEST PARLIAMENTARY DEBATERS. 
 
12.  (C)  AFTER NATIONAL\'S SUCCESSFUL RE-ELECTION IN 1993, 
SHIPLEY WAS REWARDED FOR HER DEFT HANDLING OF THE DIFFICULT 
SOCIAL WELFARE PORTFOLIO WITH A JUMP IN CABINET (FROM 11TH TO 5TH 
PLACE--THE BIGGEST PROMOTION IN THAT CABINET SHUFFLE), BUT WITH 
ANOTHER DIFFICULT JOB.  AS MINISTER OF HEALTH, SHIPLEY WAS ASKED 
AGAIN TO CAP AND THEN CUT PUBLIC SPENDING.  SHIPLEY MANAGED HER 
PORTFOLIO WELL, AND INTRODUCED MANY OF THE CUTS IN UNIVERSAL 
HEALTH BENEFITS THAT ARE ONLY NOW COMING INTO BEING -- TO THE 
CONCERN OF MANY NEW ZEALANDERS.  (HEALTH CUTS REMAIN AN ACHILLES 
HEEL FOR NATIONAL, AND WILL PROBABLY REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE 
IN THE RUN-UP TO THE NEXT ELECTION, REQUIRED NO LATER THAN 
OCTOBER 1999.) 
 
13.  (C)  WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MIXED-MEMBER PROPORTIONAL 
(MMP) PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION IN THE 1996 ELECTION AND THE 
FORMATION OF A NATIONAL-NEW ZEALAND FIRST (NZF) COALITION IN 
DECEMBER 1996, SHIPLEY HAD REPORTEDLY HOPED FOR A RESPITE AND A 
REWARD WITH A JUNIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO.  INSTEAD, SHE 
BECAME MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT, STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES AND STATE 
SERVICES (SHE WOULD LATER REGAIN THE WOMEN\'S AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO 
AND RELINQUISH THE STATE SERVICES PORTFOLIO).  ONCE AGAIN, 
HOWEVER, SHE THREW HERSELF INTO HER WORK, ACHIEVING OPEN SKIES 
AGREEMENTS WITH THE U.S., SINGAPORE, MALAYSIA AND NEW AVIATION 
LIBERALIZATION ACCORDS WITH THE UK AND SOUTH AFRICA. 
 
14.  (C)  UPON THE FORMATION OF THE COALITION, SUPPORT FOR PM 
BOLGER BEGAN TO SLIDE WITHIN HIS PARTY AND IN PUBLIC OPINION 
POLLS.  AT THE SAME TIME, SHIPLEY\'S STATURE BEGAN TO GROW WITHIN 
THE PARTY AND ON THE STREET.  THE MEDIA PICKED UP THE DRUMBEAT 
AND, FOR SOME TIME, PALACE COUP RUMORS AROUND PARLIAMENT BECAME 
COMMONPLACE. 
 
15.  (C)  SHIPLEY\'S STATURE WAS FURTHER ENHANCED AS SHE BEGAN TO 
DISTANCE HERSELF PUBLICLY FROM NATIONAL\'S COALITION PARTNER AND 
NZF\'S CONTROVERSIAL LEADER, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND TREASURER 
WINSTON PETERS.  AMIDST PETERS\'S DEMANDS DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS 
TO FORM THE COALITION, SHIPLEY ASKED, \"HOW MANY RATS DO WE HAVE 
TO SWALLOW?\"  LATER, SHE PUBLICLY OPPOSED A REFERENDUM ON 
COMPULSORY RETIREMENT SAVINGS CHAMPIONED BY PETERS THAT LOST BY 
MORE THAN 90 PER CENT OF THE VOTE. 
 
16.  (C)  AMIDST BOLGER\'S LANGUISHING POLLS AND DURING HIS VISIT 
TO THE COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING IN SCOTLAND AND 
TO PARIS IN EARLY NOVEMBER, SHIPLEY LAUNCHED A SECRETIVE, WELL- 
PLANNED AND SUCCESSFUL LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE IN THE NATIONAL 
CAUCUS.  AFTER INTENSE BEHIND-THE-SCENES NEGOTIATIONS, BOLGER 
RESIGNED IN FAVOR OF SHIPLEY AS PARTY LEADER ON NOVEMBER 3. 
(SOME OBSERVERS SPECULATED AT THE TIME THAT THE BAD BLOOD BETWEEN 
PETERS AND SHIPLEY WOULD PROVE INSURMOUNTABLE AND THAT PETERS 
WOULD PULL OUT OF THE COALITION UPON SHIPLEY\'S ACCESSION. 
INDEED, PETERS EXPLORED FORMING A GOVERNMENT WITH LABOUR AFTER 
SHIPLEY BECAME NATIONAL\'S LEADER, BUT RETURNED TO THE COALITION 
AFTER LABOUR TURNED HIM DOWN (REF A).  AFFIRMING THEIR 
PRAGMATISM, SHIPLEY AND PETERS HAVE REPORTEDLY SINCE PATCHED OVER 
THEIR DIFFERENCES.)  SHOWING A DEGREE OF SENSITIVITY, SHE GAVE 
BOLGER A DECENT FINAL INTERVAL AS PM, ALLOWING HIM TO TRAVEL TO 
THE VANCOUVER APEC SUMMIT AND TO VISIT CHINA AS SCHEDULED.  ON 
DECEMBER 8, AFTER ONLY TEN YEARS IN PARLIAMENT, SHIPLEY WAS SWORN 
IN AS NEW ZEALAND\'S FIRST WOMAN PRIME MINISTER.

SHIPLEY TODAY 
------------- 
17.  (C)  JENNY SHIPLEY DESCRIBES HERSELF AS \"CONSERVATIVE 
CENTER-RIGHT.\"  HER POLICY INTERESTS ARE MICROECONOMIC REFORM, 
WOMEN\'S ISSUES, EDUCATION AND SOCIAL ISSUES.  WITHIN THE NATIONAL 
PARTY, HER CREDENTIALS ON ECONOMIC REFORM ARE SOLID.  HOWEVER, 
HER LIBERAL LEANINGS ON SOCIAL ISSUES (BIRTH CONTROL, SEX 
EDUCATION, WOMEN\'S ISSUES, GAY RIGHTS) HAVE ALLOWED HER TO CLAIM 
NEW TERRITORY FOR NATIONAL (WHICH MAY PROVE VALUABLE IN 
ATTRACTING THE FEMALE UNDECIDED VOTE IN FUTURE ELECTIONS), BUT 
HAVE ALSO OCCASIONALLY ANGERED SOME OF HER PARTY COLLEAGUES AND 
AMUSED OTHERS.  (IN ONE UNUSUAL CAUCUS MEETING, SHIPLEY OFFERED 
TO EDUCATE NATIONAL MPS ON HOW TO EXAMINE THEMSELVES FOR SEXUALLY 
TRANSMITTED DISEASES.  HER EMBARRASSED COLLEAGUES DECLINED.) 
 
18.  (C)  SHIPLEY DESCRIBES HER APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE AS ONE OF 
SELF-RELIANCE -- STRESSING INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND 
DISCIPLINE.  SHE DEEMS HER COMMUNICATION SKILLS TO BE HER BEST 
ASSET, ONCE BOASTING PUBLICLY THAT SHE COULD \"SELL RICE TO A 
CHINAMAN.\"  WHILE NOT AN ACADEMIC OR AN IDEAS PERSON, SHIPLEY HAS 
POLITICAL SMARTS, SEIZES HER PORTFOLIO, LEARNS IT INSIDE AND OUT, 
AND STAYS CURRENT.  SHE IS ALSO A GOOD MANAGER AND HAS ASSEMBLED 
ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST, MOST LOYAL STAFFS IN PARLIAMENT.  OBSERVERS 
HAVE CHARACTERIZED HER AS ICY, CORRECT, UNFLAPPABLE, AND ABLE TO 
WORDLESSLY CONVEY THE SCHOOL-TEACHER-LIKE MESSAGE OF \"DON\'T MESS 
WITH ME.\"  SHIPLEY STATES THAT HER CHRISTIAN FAITH IS IMPORTANT 
TO HER, BUT RARELY TALKS ABOUT RELIGION IN PUBLIC.  SHE IS 
INTERESTED IN WATER SPORTS AND LIKES TO SPEND HER FREE TIME WITH 
FAMILY, GARDENING, READING AND COOKING OUT ON THE BARBECUE. 
 
---------------------------------- 
SHIPLEY\'S FEELING TOWARDS THE U.S. 
---------------------------------- 
19.  (C)  THE PM HAS WARM FEELINGS TOWARDS THE U.S.  WHEN SHIPLEY 
FIRST ENTERED PARLIAMENT, SHE OFTEN ATTENDED USG FUNCTIONS BUT 
NOW DOES SO LESS FREQUENTLY DUE TO HER BUSY SCHEDULE.  IN APRIL 
1989, SHIPLEY WENT TO THE U.S. ON A USIS IV GRANT TO LOOK AT 
ORGANIC FOOD AND GREENHOUSE GAS ISSUES.  ALTHOUGH SHIPLEY IS 
WELL-DISPOSED TO THE U.S., SHE IS HER OWN PERSON AND TAKES 
POSITIONS THAT ARE IN HER OWN PERCEIVED INTEREST.  LIKE MANY OF 
HER NATIONAL PARTY COLLEAGUES IN THE RUN-UP TO THE 1990 ELECTION, 
SHE DID NOT OPPOSE NATIONAL\'S ADOPTION OF LABOUR\'S ANTI-NUCLEAR 
POLICY (BELIEVING THAT TO DO SO WOULD HARM NATIONAL\'S ELECTION 
PROSPECTS).  IN THE WAKE OF HER FIRST FOREIGN INTERVIEW AFTER 
BECOMING PARTY LEADER, SHIPLEY TOOK TO THE FLOOR OF PARLIAMENT TO 
REFUTE A SYDNEY MORNING HERALD ARTICLE THAT STATED SHE WOULD 
RECONSIDER NZ\'S ANTI-NUCLEAR POLICY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES 
(REF B).  SHIPLEY\'S CLARIFICATION EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED (FOR THE 
TIME BEING) ANY CHANCE THAT SHE MIGHT PUSH FOR A CHANGE IN NZ\'S 
NUCLEAR POLICY. 
 
----------------------- 
HUSBAND, BURTON SHIPLEY 
----------------------- 
20.  (C)  MARRIED TO SHIPLEY FOR 24 YEARS, BURTON SHIPLEY IS A 45 
YEAR OLD, MID-LEVEL FINANCIAL ADVISOR WITH WESTPAC BANK.  A 
FARMER BY TRADE, HE BECAME A FULL-TIME HOUSEHUSBAND FOR TWO YEARS 
(RAISING TWO CHILDREN), WHILE HIS WIFE COMMUTED TO PARLIAMENT. 
ONCE THEIR CHILDREN ENTERED BOARDING SCHOOL, BURTON LEFT THE FARM 
AND WORKED AS A LOBBYIST FOR THE DEER FARMERS\' ASSOCIATION, AND 
THEN AS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR FOR MONEY MANAGERS BEFORE JOINING 
WESTPAC.  AT 6\'4\", BURTON IS OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR HIS WIFE\'S 
BODYGUARD.  HE IS A FORMER BASKETBALL PLAYER (JUST MISSING OUT ON 
NEW ZEALAND\'S NATIONAL TEAM), AND CURRENTLY ENJOYS SAILING.  NOT 
SHY ABOUT VOICING HIS OPINIONS (TO HIS WIFE AND, AT LEAST BEFORE 
HER ACCESSION TO PM, TO OTHERS), BURTON SAYS HE IS FURTHER RIGHT 
THAN HIS WIFE AND GOOD AT IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS, BUT NOT THEIR 
SOLUTIONS.  BOTH THEIR CHILDREN ATTEND CANTERBURY UNIVERSITY. 
 
----------------------------------- 
WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID ABOUT SHIPLEY 
----------------------------------- 
21.  (C)  HOW OTHERS SEE SHIPLEY IS ILLUMINATING: 
 
-- NATIONAL PARTY PM ROBERT MULDOON DESCRIBED SHIPLEY AS: \"...A 
FRONT ROW RUGBY PROP...BASICALLY A NICE PERSON, BUT IF YOU THINK 
A MIDDLE-AGED, OVER-WEIGHT FARMER\'S WIFE CAN REMAKE THE WELFARE 
SYSTEM THEN YOU\'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.\" 
 
-- LABOR DEPUTY LEADER AND FINANCIAL SPOKESPERSON MICHAEL CULLEN 
CALLED SHIPLEY (AS SOCIAL WELFARE MINISTER): \"THE MOST HATED 
MINISTER IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY.\" 
 
-- FORMER NEW ZEALAND FIRST MP AND CURRENT NATIONAL COMMENTATOR 
MICHAEL LAWS RECENTLY CALLED SHIPLEY: \"THE HUMAN FACE OF THE 
SPANISH INQUISITION...THE SILENT MENACE OF NEW ZEALAND 
POLITICS...SHE CAN TELL YOU IN WONDERFUL WARM TONES HOW SHE IS 
GOING TO GARROTTE YOU AND THEN THROW YOUR INTESTINES OVER HER 
LEFT SHOULDER.\" 
 
-- FORMER LABOR PM DAVID LANGE RECENTLY DESCRIBED HER AS: 
\"...TOUGHER THAN ANY MAN IN CABINET...THE ONLY WORTHY NATIONAL 
OPPONENT SINCE MULDOON...BEATING HER IS LIKE BEATING SOUTH AFRICA 
(IN RUGBY).\" 
 
22.  (C)  COMMENT:  IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO REDUCE SHIPLEY TO A 
RICHARDSON-CLONE, A THATCHER-CLONE OR \"BOLGER IN A FROCK.\"  SHE 
IS A SMART, HARD-WORKING POLITICIAN, ALTERNATELY RUTHLESS AND 
PRAGMATIC AS NEEDED.  SHE WILL TRY TO AVOID BOLGER\'S MISTAKE OF 
BEING SEEN AS TOO CHUMMY WITH NZF AND PETERS AND ISOLATED FROM 
NATIONAL\'S BACKBENCH.  NONETHELESS, THE NEW PM REALIZES THAT 
UNDER MMP, NATIONAL\'S RE-ELECTION HOPES RIDE ON A WELL-RUN 
COALITION THAT ADDRESSES IMPORTANT DOMESTIC ISSUES.

TAGS: PREL, NZ 
SUBJECT: THE U.S.-NEW ZEALAND RELATIONSHIP: WHAT WE COULD 
NOT SAY IN THE MISSION PROGRAM PLAN 
 
REF: 03 WELLINGTON 0339 
 
Classified By: Charge David R. Burnett; Reasons 1.5 (B and D) 
 
 1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Since New Zealand walked away from the 
ANZUS pact in 1986, we have had growing doubts about its 
willingness and ability to contribute to regional security. 
New Zealand remains a relatively friendly, like-minded 
partner in many policy areas. But the ad hoc nature of the 
its security commitments, decline of its defense capabilities 
under successive governments, the current government,s view 
of multilateralism as a means to limit U.S. power, and its 
flirtation with China and France to limit U.S. and Australian 
influence in the Pacific raise questions about the extent to 
which we can count on New Zealand on security issues in the 
future.  The March 9-13 visit of CINCPAC Fargo to New Zealand 
could make an important contribution to our dialogue with New 
Zealand on its commitment to and capacity for sharing 
regional security responsibilities, as well as the growing 
compatibility gap with our other South Pacific partner, 
Australia.  The visit may have a direct bearing on release of 
the opposition National Party,s paper on U.S.-New Zealand 
relations and will follow a March 3 meeting between PM Clark 
and Australian PM Howard, events that are expected to raise 
these same concerns.  End Summary. 
 
2. (S/NF)  COMMITMENT:  New Zealand,s decision to sit out 
the invasion of Iraq was a reminder of how far its security 
policies and interests have drifted from those of its 
traditional allies since NZ walked away from the ANZUS pact 
in 1986 (reftel).  Subsequent deployment of 60 combat 
engineers to Basra has allowed the current government to 
offset some of the damage done to its traditional 
relationships while continuing to place criticism of the 
Coalition in local media.  But the drift in policy is more 
fundamental than just differences over Iraq.  In laying 
groundwork for the visit of Chinese President Hu, the Clark 
government privately mooted that it was necessary for New 
Zealand to work more closely with other powers such as China 
and France to curtail U.S. and Australian influence in the 
region.  During the visit of the Chinese Vice-Minister for 
Trade, NZ Trade Minister Sutton publicly claimed that China 
was New Zealand\'s most important and valued trading partner, 
a claim that left Australian officials here scratching their 
heads in wonder.  Officials of the current government 
continue to tout the importance of using the UN and other 
multilateral organizations as a means of containing, rather 
than engaging with or influencing, the United States. 
 
3. (S/NF)  Meanwhile, beneath the political level, 
long-standing military and intelligence ties continue 
virtually unabated.  One can make the case that restrictions 
levied by the USG on programs in those areas in the wake of 
New Zealand\'s 1986 withdrawal from ANZUS have been 
progressively weakened over the intervening years.  Increased 
use of waivers to provide training or intelligence support 
for New Zealanders undertaking missions of interest to the 
United States makes sense. Indeed, in this Mission\'s view, 
any military-to-military or intelligence activity that can be 
shown to have net benefit to the United States is clearly 
worth pursuing.  However, it is important to be aware that 
these activities are used in New Zealand\'s domestic political 
arena as a counterweight to opposition claims that the GNZ is 
neglecting the bilateral relationship or is letting New 
Zealand\'s strategic policies drift.  This is why the GNZ 
routinely attempts to bypass normal diplomatic channels to 
press for further weakening of the restrictions imposed in 
the wake of the introduction of the anti-nuclear policy. 
 
4. (S/NF)  It is also useful to note that the degree of 
commitment expressed by military or intelligence counterparts 
is often stronger than that of their political masters. For 
example, in a discussion with State Counterterrorism 
Coordinator Cofer Black on Indonesia, NZ military and 
intelligence officials were enthusiastic about the 
possibility that they could augment U.S. and Australian 
efforts.  However, the PM\'s senior policy advisor immediately 
interjected that past Indonesian repression in East Timor 
would make it impossible for New Zealand to engage in CT 
activities there.  The same individual also agreed after 
lengthy discussion of various CT threats in the region that 
these matters were indeed serious, but said New Zealand\'s 
senior political leadership was far more concerned about food 
security than physical security.  With commitment gaps like 
these, it is important that we take our cue on New Zealand\'s 
commitment to regional security from those who set the 
budgets and mandate the policies. 
 
5. (S/NF) CAPABILITY:  Successive governments have allowed 
New Zealand\'s defense capabilities to decline since the 
mid-1980s.  We have been told by retired GNZ officials who 
were in senior positions in the Lange government at the time 
the anti-nuclear policy was instituted that one of the 
considerations favoring the policy was that it would lead to 
NZ withdrawing or being pushed out of ANZUS, thereby 
lessening the country\'s defense spending requirements at a 
time of fiscal and economic crisis.  Defense budgets since 
that time have not even been adequate to cover replacement 
costs for basic coastal defense hardware.  To its credit, the 
Clark government, after scrapping the previous government\'s 
agreement to buy F-16s, has moved to replace aging frigates, 
helicopters and light-armored vehicles.  It has allocated 
NZ$3.0 billion over 10 years for this purpose.  We have asked 
repeatedly at all levels where that number came from, and 
have never gotten a satisfactory answer.  In any case, given 
this apparently arbitrary budget figure, the military has 
done its best to set priorities consistent with basic 
defense, a limited peacekeeping role and an occasional nod to 
its previous allies (e.g., sending an appropriately 
configured frigate to the Persian Gulf).  Some of the new 
equipment, such as the LAV-IIIs, is less versatile than the 
equipment it is replacing.  Other hardware will be limited in 
scope because it is meant to be used with systems that the 
NZDF will no longer have -- e.g., combat helicopters but no 
joint strike fighters.  Finally, maintenance of the new 
systems is not fully accounted for in the acquisition and 
deployment costs covered by the NZ$3.0 billion budgeted. 
 
6. (S/NF)  Cuts in hardware and redefinition of the 
military\'s role as peacekeepers rather than peacemakers have 
made recruitment and retention more difficult.  Fighter 
pilots have left the Air Force in droves.  The NZDF is 
hard-pressed to come up with two rotations of troops for 
peacekeeping operations when even that is less than the 
minimum three rotations required for effective long-term 
operations.  Only the elite SAS (three squadrons) is still 
fully equipped and funded for missions relevant to the new 
threats emerging in the region and beyond.  The combat 
engineers in Basra and the PRT in Bamian Province have 
acquitted themselves well, but have been heavily dependent 
for transport and other support services on ourselves and the 
British.  Closer to home, when the Australians asked the 
Kiwis for help in the Solomon Islands, New Zealand\'s initial 
offer was to keep an army company \"on reserve\" in New 
Zealand.  Meanwhile, Fiji sent 400 or so troops.  Finally, 
after great pressure from the Australians, the GNZ relented 
and agreed to send troops.  After all that, according to the 
Australian High Commissioner (protect), due to an equipment 
breakdown, the troops had to be flown to the Solomons on 
Australian aircraft. 
 
7. (S/NF) COMPATIBILITY:  Given reduced commitment levels and 
declining capability, the ability to work with 
better-equipped, more focused forces would seem to be crucial 
to maintaining an appropriate level of influence in the 
region and beyond.  This Mission does not expect a country of 
four million people to punch at the same level as the United 
States, or even Australia.  However, the growing gap between 
what the Australians can do in the South Pacific and the 
ability of the Kiwis to help them do it is of great concern 
to Australia, and should be of concern to us as well.  For 
example, we are pleased that New Zealand plans to equip its 
new frigates with communications systems compatible with our 
own.  However, the contribution those frigates could make to 
peacekeeping operations in Melanesia or Indonesia is limited, 
and the military assets the NZDF could contribute to such 
operations will not be interoperable with either Australian 
hardware or our own. 
 
8. (S/NF) OUR MESSAGE:  We have already begun to raise the 
above concerns with the GNZ.  Beginning with Admiral Fargo\'s 
visit, we would like to give them a higher profile in private 
and in public.  In doing so, we must be careful not allow 
ourselves to be painted by the Clark government as bullies 
telling Kiwis how to spend their tax dollars.  We would 
suggest the following themes: 
 
-- We value our long-standing military and intelligence 
relationship with New Zealand and the commonality of values 
on which that relationship is based. 
 
-- We are facing a world that has become increasingly 
uncertain since the end of the Cold War; we all need to know 
whom we can count on, for what, and when. 
 
-- Many decisions by successive New Zealand governments over 
the past 20 years beginning with, but not limited to, the 
anti-nuclear policy have raised questions about whether we 
can continue to count on New Zealand as a partner in ensuring 
the security of this region. 
 
-- While we may differ on any number of aspects of foreign 
policy, the security of this region is clearly of mutual 
concern. 
 
-- We look forward to continued consultations with the 
Government of New Zealand on your country\'s commitment to 
this vital objective, your capability to join with us and 
others to contribute to achieving our shared goals, and the 
compatibility of New Zealand\'s future contributions with 
those of its other partners. 
 
9. (S/NF)  Comment:  We believe the message themes outlined 
above will reduce the Clark government\'s wiggle room on 
whether it prefers to work with us and Australia in the 
region, or against us.  We also believe engaging in an honest 
dialogue on these themes will reassure New Zealanders that, 
while we sould like to be able to count on a New Zealand with 
greater capability, compatibility and commitment, we are not 
asking them to do more than their fair share.  In sum, the 
creative ambiguity in our relationship since 1986 has 
permitted us to do a great deal together in areas of mutual 
interest, despite a major policy difference.  It has also 
allowed New Zealand to drift farther and farther from its 
former alliance partners in its commitment to what should be 
shared foreign policy goals.  It has permitted a generation 
of New Zealanders to believe our shared history began, and 
perhaps ended, with the Vietnam War.  Worst of all, it has 
encouraged them to ignore any parallels between China\'s 
interest in the region today and that of Japan in the 1920s 
and \'30s. 
 
10. (S/NF)  One of the most common questions we have run into 
in discussing the remote prospect that the  GNZ might scrap 
all or part of the anti-nuclear policy is \"If we were to do 
so, would you expect us to resurrect the commitments of 
ANZUS?\"  At present, we do not have a good answer to that 
question. Replying \"Change the policy and we will see,\" is of 
scant help to those Kiwis who would like to see a closer 
U.S.-NZ relationship. This Mission believes a frank 
discussion of our mutual expectations on regional security 
commitments, capabilities and compatibility would be useful 
in furthering the bilateral relationship. If carefully 
handled, it could also make a fruitful contribution to the 
public discussion of the U.S.-New Zealand relationship 
sparked by the U.S.-Australia FTA negotiations.

FOR REASONS 1.5(B,D) 
 
1. (C/NF) Summary:  New Zealand Opposition National Party 
leader Don Brash has formally declared that his party would 
not propose making changes to NZ\'s anti-nuclear legislation - 
at least not until after 2005 Parliamentary election.  Brash 
said a future National Government would not change NZ\'s 
anti-nuclear legislation without a national referendum 
indicating strong public approval.  Since early May National 
has debated an internal party (Creech Commission) report that 
recommends keeping NZ\'s anti-nuclear policy but amending NZ\'s 
anti-nuclear legislation to allow nuclear-powered, but not 
nuclear-armed, vessels to enter NZ waters.  Brash\'s 
announcement is an attempt to remove a controversial issue 
from the pre-election agenda.  Brash privately reiterated to 
Ambassador that he remains personally committed to changing 
the legislation.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU/NF) New Zealand Opposition National Party leader Don 
Brash formally declared June 22 that his party would not 
propose making changes to the anti-nuclear legislation - at 
least not before 2005 Parliamentary election.  Brash\'s 
statement allowed that if National won the upcoming elections 
in 2005 and formed a Government, it would seek improved 
relations with the U.S. and Australia.  He added that a 
National government might commission a referendum on changing 
the anti-nuclear legislation if it appeared that changing the 
legislation would improve NZ\'s relationship with the U.S. 
However, Brash noted that he was unable to fully \"discuss the 
issue with Canberra and Washington\" while he was only leader 
of the opposition.  He added that it would be necessary for 
any future National government to understand whether the 
United States would be inclined to normalize bilateral 
relations if NZ retained its no-nukes policy but amended NZ\'s 
anti-nuclear legislation to allow nuclear-powered, but not 
nuclear-armed, vessels to enter NZ waters.  (Comment:  This 
was the key proposal contained in an internal National Party 
(Creech Commission) report into NZ-US relations released in 
May.  End Comment.) 
 
3. (SBU/NF) The Labour government\'s reaction to Brash\'s 
statement was predictable - it accused Brash of raising and 
then walking away from a sensitive \"iconic\" issue.  However, 
the author of the internal National party report, former 
Deputy Prime Minister Wyatt Creech, chimed in to express his 
public dismay at Brash\'s announcement, fearing that members 
of the National Party were more frightened over changes to 
the anti-nuclear legislation than the general public.  Creech 
contested the notion that the legislation was \"iconic\" and 
immutable, pointing to a recent independent poll (reftel) 
that showed a proportionally larger number of New Zealanders 
would support changes to the anti-nuclear legislation 
provided the U.S. did not to send nuclear-powered ships to 
New Zealand.  Creech commented that as people became better 
informed on the matter, their support for a change to the 
legislation rose. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
4. (C/NF) With a paper-thin lead in the polls, Brash feels he 
can ill afford to alienate any potential supporters over 
hypothetical changes to New Zealand\'s nuclear legislation. 
With this formal statement, Brash is trying to remove a 
potentially damaging plank from his election platform. 
However, he had been careful to leave open the option that 
National will reexamine the issue if it returns to 
Government.  Brash told Ambassador privately on June 24 that 
internal polling points to a slow shift in public opini

TIMOTHY P. ZUNIGA-BROWN, FOR REASONS 1.5(B,D) 
 
1. (C) The Government of New Zealand formalized diplomatic 
relations with Cuba in 2001, with their Ambassador resident 
in Mexico City accredited to Havana.  According to Mike Shaw, 
Americas Division, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade, the GoNZ uses meetings with Cuban officials to 
\"express its concern over the human rights situation in Cuba, 
and encourage moves towards democratization and the promotion 
of human rights.  These include the proper treatment of those 
who hold political views in opposition to the Cuban 
government.\"  This is consistent with the GoNZ\'s policy of 
engagement with states that have poor human rights records. 
Post is unaware of any NZ entity or nationals who would be 
subject to Title III of the LIBERTAD Act.  The GoNZ would 
strenuously object to any effort to apply Title III to a NZ 
national or entity on extraterritoriality grounds.  The GoNZ 
is strongly supportive of U.S. positions re Cuba\'s human 
rights record, and use of Title III would jeopardize 
continued good-faith cooperation. 
 
2. (SBU) Economically, Cuba was New Zealand\'s 40th largest 
trading partner in calendar year 2003, with exports to Cuba 
at NZ$68 million (USD42.1 million,) and imports at NZ$934,000 
(USD579,000.)  97 percent of these exports were in the dairy 
sector, specifically milk powder.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND TIP REPORT: LESSONS LEARNED 
 
REF: A. WELLINGTON 521 
     B. SINGAPORE 1889 
 
1. (SBU/NF) Following the turbulent June 14 release of the 
2004 TIP report, which named New Zealand for the first time 
(ref a), Embassy Wellington would like to add its strong 
support to the recommendations contained in Embassy 
Singapore\'s recent excellent cable (ref b).  While the GNZ is 
hypersensitive to any perceived criticism of its human rights 
record (and a negative response to the TIP report was fully 
anticipated), the language used in the New Zealand narrative 
of the TIP report directly undermined the credibility of the 
report and negatively affected the USG\'s image with the NZ 
public.  The report, as released, allowed the GNZ and 
domestic media to shift off-message from the fight against 
trafficking.  The Prime Minister, other senior government 
officials and local commentators instead challenged the 
credibility of the TIP report\'s NZ-specific narrative. 
 
2. (SBU/NF) Drawing on ref b, Post would like to offer its 
own observations and suggestions for improving the TIP report 
format, making the report\'s narrative more accurate and 
thereby allowing us to hold a more constructive dialogue on 
ways and means of combating trafficking in our host country. 
 
-- First and foremost, embassies must draft the initial 
country narratives, as is done for the Human Rights Report 
and the International Religious Freedom Report, with far 
greater success. 
 
- Drafting the country narrative of the TIP report at post 
would significantly reduce the time commitment currently 
required.  This year, post first sought to address the 
extensive questionnaire provided, and then Post and the Desk 
were obliged to dedicate substantial amount of time to 
editing and attempting to make G/TIP\'s initial narrative 
accurate. 
 
- As a SEP Post, we are fully cognizant of the need to 
prioritize increasing demands on limited resources.  In New 
Zealand, however, the P/E officer tasked with drafting the 
HRR is already in contact with the same Government agencies 
and NGOs used for the TIP Report, and is best placed to 
address questions on both topics with the same set of 
interlocutors.  As over 60 percent of information included in 
the questionnaire is not used in the report, Post could 
reduce the amount of time used outlining legislation or 
policies that do not change from year to year. 
 
- Another major concern for Post was a perceived attitude 
among G/TIP that New Zealand\'s report and tier designation 
should somehow follow the report and tier designation of 
Australia -- despite the vastly different scale and type of 
human trafficking concerns in both countries. 
 
-- Inclusion in the report is currently based on a 
Department-set threshold of 100 individuals.  In drafting 
answers to G/TIP\'s initial questionnaire, Post was unable to 
find solid evidence of over 100 cases of human trafficking in 
the 2003 calendar year.  G/TIP\'s decision to include NZ was 
therefore based on a single multi-year study that found 
evidence of child prostitution.  We are unaware of any other 
country having been listed solely on the grounds of internal 
childhood prostitution.  While this does trigger NZ\'s 
inclusion in the report by the definitions of our 
legislation, it is not a definition accepted by New 
Zealanders.  They consider us to be \"stretching\" the commonly 
accepted definition of trafficking to include NZ. 
 
-- The TIP Report should be made as inclusive as possible, 
making it a global report that incorporates an assessment of 
every country in the world - again, as is the case with the 
Department\'s annual Human Rights report. 
 
-- The tier system provoked the GoNZ concerns to focus on how 
to &get off the list,8 instead of how to improve their 
fight against trafficking.  By including all countries, the 
focus would hopefully return to the content of the report, 
and not the Tier designation or who is and is not included. 
 
4.  (SBU/NF) Focus on the positive and means of best 
advancing country practices in the fight against trafficking. 
 
- Make a list of Best Practices available to reporting 
officers.  For example, New Zealand has proved extremely 
flexible in ending visa-free regimes for countries that are 
suspected of trafficking victims to NZ.  In addition, despite 
the lack of a national coordinator, NZ has been a leader in 
information sharing between domestic law enforcement and 
social agencies. 
- Provide a set of recommendations for reference on ways 
countries in the report might better address their 
trafficking situation.  Such recommendations would provide 
valuable topics with which to engage host governments, media 
and the wider public at the time of the report\'s release. 
For instance, the New Zealand narrative of the report 
contains one recommendation ) the creation of a national 
coordinator for trafficking issues.  Unfortunately, 
discussion of this useful step was lost as New Zealand 
officials and media generally dismissed the NZ narrative 
because of choice of language used. 
 
5. (SBU/NF) Post would like to reiterate its strong 
commitment to the principles underlying the production of an 
annual TIP Report.  We believe that this report is part of a 
process that does not begin and end with the release of the 
report, and looks forward to effectively contributing to the 
fight against trafficking.

1.  Embassy welcomes National Science Foundation official 
Dr. Jamala JONES to New Zealand from July 6th to July 17th, 
2004.  The purpose of this visit is to attend the Air New 
Zealand Engineering Services Program Management Review in 
Christchurch. 
 
2.  Embassy understands that no further assistance is 
required. 
 
3.  Embassy point of contact is Political-Economic officer 
Dorothy Rogers. 
Contact details are as follows: 
Office:  644-462-6043 
Fax:     644-472-3537 
Cell:    027-451-2538 
E-mail:  RogersD@state.gov 
 
4.  All official visitors to the Embassy are required to 
report to the Regional Security Office for a TDY security 
briefing. 
 
5.  Visitors should use local taxi service, which is 
generally safe, reliable and frequent.  Taxi fare from the 
airport to downtown Christchurch hotels is approximately 
NZD35. 
 
6. Travelers can exchange currency at the airport upon 
arrival and ATM machines are readily available throughout 
New Zealand. 
 
7.  Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZ$200 (US $150).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be administered 
immediately and without warnings. 
 
8.  Security Assessment: 
 
a.  There are no local terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the regional security office. 
 
b.  Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat mail 
have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions in New 
Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, various 
groups in New Zealand have demonstrated occasionally at the 
embassy in Wellington and at the consulate in Auckland. 
These demonstrations were of a small scale and were 
peacefully conducted.  During these demonstrations, the host 
country police and protective services provided adequate 
protection to the embassy and consulate. 
 
c.  While New Zealand is considered a low threat crime 
environment, Wellington and Auckland have experienced an 
increase in violent and petty crimes.  Home invasion 
robberies and assaults, once very rare, are becoming more 
frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur countrywide. 
Visitors should be aware that street crime is a daily 
occurrence in the larger cities, including Wellington and 
Auckland.  Common sense precautions should be taken, 
especially at night, to avoid becoming a target of 
opportunity. 
 
d.  All forms of public transportation are generally safe at 
all times of the day.

1. (C) Summary:  New Zealand\'s largest opposition party, 
National, held an up-beat, almost giddy, Annual Conference 
July 9-11.  Polling slightly ahead of the ruling Labour 
government, conference delegates expressed confidence in 
winning the 2005 election.  In contrast to the festive 
atmosphere, Nat Party leader Brash - a former Reserve Bank 
chief - cautioned conference delegates to avoid complacency. 
The National Conference studiously avoided any public 
discussion of NZ\'s anti-nuclear legislation; foreign policy 
and defense issues did not appear on the formal agenda. 
While National\'s standing in the polls (around 42 percent) 
has resulted in increased membership and a growing belief in 
the possibility of a 2005 win, National\'s leadership remains 
nervous.  End summary. 
 
Cohesion, Stability, Policy 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) New Zealand\'s largest opposition parliamentary party, 
National, held its Annual Conference in Auckland July 9-11. 
In sharp contrast to the 2003 conference (ref C), when 
National was polling at half of this year\'s level, the 
conference was attended by almost 600 enthusiastic delegates, 
who expressed confidence in winning the 2005 election.  A 
rock\'n\'roll version of the National Anthem, a rousing speech 
by controversial Auckland Mayor John Banks (a former National 
Party Minister), and a taped video appearance by Australian 
Prime Minister John Howard reflected this optimism. 
Pragmatically, the true focus of the agenda was on explaining 
the candidate selection process, policy development and 
campaign planning.  The agenda was carefully designed to 
display the Party cohesion -- which had been missing in the 
aftermath of the Nat\'s disastrous 2002 election.  The 
conference highlighted National\'s core policies and served as 
a showcase for up-and-coming talent from the pool of current 
MPs.  Associate Finance Minister John Key and Welfare 
Spokeswoman Katherine Rich were standouts, delivering strong 
speeches despite their relative newness to politics. 
Opposition leader Don Brash was in high demand, managing to 
appear not only at the speeches, but at coffees and 
breakfasts, eagerly searching out recommendations for ways to 
broaden the Party\'s appeal. 
 
Caution ) Danger Ahead 
---------------------- 
 
3. (C) In contrast to the festive atmosphere, the personally 
somber Brash - a former Reserve Bank head - delivered a \"very 
sobering message,\" asking delegates to work doubly hard to 
avoid &looking back on a scrap-book of temporary polling 
successes.8  A Conference theme admonished Nat leaders to 
resist the urge to gloat and to focus on the rough campaign 
ahead.  National is polling in the mid-40 percent range - 
roughly parallel to the Labour Government.  Internal party 
polls show that policy issues yet to be raised by Don Brash 
in the lead up to 2005 elections (welfare, education, and 
economic development) were unlikely to give the Nats the kind 
of broad popular boost in the polls that followed Brash\'s 
recent speech on race on race relations (ref b).  In a shift 
from the policies pursued in the 2002 election, where 
National tried to appeal to center-left voters, the 
Conference hammered home the catchphrases of the center-right 
) all major policy speeches emphasized the importance of 
personal responsibility, the paramount importance of the 
nuclear family and the necessity of tax cuts and support for 
employers. 
 
Don\'t Rock the (Nuclear) Boat 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The National Conference studiously avoided any public 
discussion of NZ\'s anti-nuclear legislation; foreign policy 
and defense issues did not appear on the formal agenda.  In a 
closed session on Party polling, Nat Party leaders pointed to 
a serious dip in public support for National\'s defense policy 
following the release of an internal party report (Creech 
Commission report) that recommended changing NZ\'s 
anti-nuclear legislation.  The polls rose following Brash\'s 
announcement (ref A) that any changes to the legislation 
would be taken to a referendum after the 2005 election.  A 
breakfast meeting billed as a discussion of the Creech 
Commission report was instead a broad discussion of reforms 
needed to improve the New Zealand Defence Force.  Nat Party 
staffers noted that the speaker had been asked to pull back 
from the nuke issue in fear that it could overshadow media 
coverage of the Conference. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (C) National\'s rise in the polls from the 20s to the 40s 
has resulted in increased membership and a growing belief 
within the party that they just might win in 2005.  However, 
National\'s leadership remains nervous, wary that a single 
misstep or misread of public support could plunge the party 
back into the doldrums.  National\'s surge in the polls is 
largely due to Don Brash and his reputation as a political 
outsider.  Equally, National\'s caucus is largely 
inexperienced and its candidate talent pool is not very deep. 
 Still, National under Don Brash has transformed itself - at 
least for now - into a viable contender.

INDUSTRY\'S COSTS

(U) Classified by DCM David R. Burnett.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) and 
(d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  U.S. makers of medical devices and dietary 
and nutritional supplements face the prospect of additional 
regulatory costs to enter the New Zealand market -- but 
perhaps not as high as the industry had feared.  An 
Australian-New Zealand authority to regulate therapeutic 
products in both countries probably will accept U.S. 
certification of products, and not just European 
certification, as the industry had expected.  On the other 
hand, the agency will aim to recover all regulatory costs 
from the industry.  Representatives of U.S. manufacturers 
fear such costs could drive many of their products out of the 
New Zealand market. 
 
2. (U) Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical industry has endorsed 
the joint authority, while worrying that the agency will ban 
direct-to-consumer advertising.  Such advertising has helped 
a number of pharmaceutical companies to boost sales of 
unsubsidized medicines in New Zealand.  It has provided one 
of the few means available in a highly restricted market for 
pharmaceutical manufacturers to build sales for products that 
consumers pay for entirely out of pocket.  End summary. 
 
New regulation 
-------------- 
3. (U) The Australian and New Zealand health ministers signed 
a treaty December 10 to set up a trans-Tasman agency to 
regulate therapeutic products, including medical devices, 
prescription and over-the-counter medicines, dietary and 
nutritional supplements, and cosmetics and toiletries (ref 
B).  When the agency opens its doors in July 2005, it will 
replace the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) 
and the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety 
Authority (Medsafe).  Both governments are jointly working to 
establish a framework for the agency and instructions for any 
necessary legislation. 
 
4. (U) For New Zealand, the agency offered a solution to a 
long-acknowledged deficiency.  Medical devices and 
health-care products have been virtually unregulated in the 
country.  Medsafe does evaluate pharmaceuticals before 
allowing them on the market.  An adviser to the health 
ministers suggested the cost to New Zealand of participating 
in the joint agency would be less than if it had tried on its 
own to extend its regulatory authority to devices and other 
non-drug medical products. 
 
Higher costs 
------------ 
5. (C) Nonetheless, the adviser, Selwyn Katene, acknowledged 
that New Zealand\'s regulatory costs would increase 
significantly under the joint agency.  For example, the 
number of New Zealand-based staff members needed by the new 
agency would be at least double the 35 people who now staff 
Medsafe.  Moreover, Katene noted that all the agency\'s costs 
would be passed on to the industry.  Fees for registering 
products would be set to recover the costs of regulation, 
although Katene said his government recognizes it may need to 
phase in such fees to alleviate the pain to industry.  But 
with regulation over non-drug products, Katene said, \"the 
industry\'s halcyon days are over.\"  Many distributors of 
medical devices and complementary goods expect the higher 
fees to harm their sales in New Zealand (ref C).  They 
advocate setting fees according to the size of the product\'s 
market, with Australia\'s population being five times that of 
New Zealand. 
 
6. (C) The joint authority initially had intended to require 
additional documentation and possibly a quality-control audit 
for products that do not have European certification yet have 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.  However, 
Katene -- who asked that his comments July 9 not be shared 
with industry -- said New Zealand Minister of Health King had 
decided that requiring two certification processes was 
unreasonable. 
 
7. (C) That decision should greatly relieve representatives 
of U.S. medical-device manufacturers, who have argued that 
additional certification would increase the cost and time for 
marketing their products.  A number of representatives met 
with King on June 25 and -- according to Katene -- influenced 
her thinking on the issue.  Katene, a New Zealander, serves 
as secretary to the joint agency\'s ministerial council, which 
is composed of the two health ministers.  They will appoint 
the agency\'s five governing board members. 
 
Advertising\'s future 
-------------------- 
8. (C) On June 17, the Researched Medicines Industry 
Association of New Zealand (RMI) -- the pharmaceutical 
industry association -- announced in a news release its 
support of the joint agency.  Lesley Clarke, RMI\'s chief 
executive, said July 9 that the association had long backed 
the concept of a joint authority, since it would provide one 
point of entry for pharmaceutical companies to both Australia 
and New Zealand.  RMI issued the news release to bolster 
parliamentary support for the agency, after the media 
reported that the agency\'s compliance requirements could put 
medical-device and complementary-goods companies out of 
business. 
 
9. (C) However, the pharmaceutical industry worries that the 
new agency could mean an end to its ability to advertise its 
unsubsidized prescription medicines directly to New Zealand 
consumers (ref A).  Australia allows only disease-based, 
awareness-building advertising, with no mention of product 
names.  Some pharmaceutical companies have built a 
significant private purchase market in New Zealand -- in one 
case, as much as one-third of its sales -- as a way to 
counter the limits of a system of government-subsidized sales. 
 
10. (C) On that issue, Katene would say only that Minister 
King had been instructed by the cabinet to \"harmonize\" with 
Australia and that a decision for or against 
direct-to-consumer advertising had not been made. 
\"Harmonization\" generally has been thought to refer to New 
Zealand\'s adopting the Australian rules, with Australia 
seeing no need to change. 
 
11. (C) Clarke said that, other than Minister King, members 
of Parliament are supportive of or ambivalent about 
direct-to-consumer advertising.  Only Minister King appears 
to be adamantly against it, joining a small doctors\' group -- 
and no consumer groups -- that advocates a ban.  Clarke 
predicted that such advertising would continue to be allowed, 
with a ban requiring the repeal of existing law and with 
Minister King lacking her colleagues\' support. 
 
12. (C) Comment: Allowing FDA certification would remove one 
potentially discriminatory barrier to U.S. products.  Post 
remains concerned, however, about the potential decline in 
sales of U.S. medical devices and other therapeutic products 
due to anticipated higher regulatory costs and about the 
possibility that pharmaceutical companies -- already 
constrained by New Zealand government policy -- would lose 
their ability to generate private sales through advertising. 
Post hopes these concerns could be conveyed in the Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement talks with New Zealand 
scheduled for July 20.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND\'S MOBILE TERMINATION RATES UNDER 
SCRUTINY 
 
REF: WELLINGTON 428 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The New Zealand Commerce Commission has 
launched an investigation into whether a lack of competition 
has placed the country among nations with the highest rates 
for terminating mobile phone calls.  The commission could 
recommend regulation of termination charges.  Telecom, the 
former state-owned telecommunications provider, argues that 
its termination rates are justified by the high cost of 
maintaining infrastructure in mountainous and sparsely 
populated New Zealand.  Vodafone, the country\'s only other 
mobile operator, also opposes regulation of termination 
rates, contending that the marketplace is working and that 
rates have steadily dropped over the last six years. 
Meanwhile, TelstraClear -- which now resells Vodafone\'s 
mobile phone services but is developing its own mobile phone 
network -- welcomes the investigation and hopes it will 
result in mandatory price reductions.  End summary. 
 
Inquiry begins 
-------------- 
2. (U) New Zealand\'s anti-monopoly watchdog, the Commerce 
Commission, on May 13 began investigating the fees that 
mobile phone companies charge other carriers to terminate 
calls on their networks.  The commission on June 22 released 
an issues paper and invited submissions from interested 
parties, due July 19.  AT&T, which pays what it claims are 
exorbitant rates on calls it handles to New Zealand, plans 
to make a submission.  The commission is expected to publish 
its decision in mid-November.  (The issues paper can be 
viewed on the commission\'s web site, www.comcom.govt.nz.) 
 
3. (U) Vodafone and Telecom currently charge US 18 cents to 
20 cents (NZ 27 cents to 30 cents) per minute to terminate 
calls to each other\'s mobile networks.  Generally, the two 
companies set mobile termination fees at the same rate. 
However, they may charge different mobile termination rates 
to other carriers.  AT&T reported that the termination 
charge to it for calls to New Zealand is US 23.5 cents (NZ 
35 cents) per minute and that TelstraClear is seeking an 
increase to US 30 cents and Telecom, to US 25.6 cents. 
 
4. (U) The mobile termination charge can be the most 
expensive component of prices paid by callers to mobile 
phones, accounting for 30 to 60 percent of the per-minute 
cost of such calls.  The Commerce Commission\'s 
recommendation on whether to regulate mobile termination 
rates could have significant impact in a country where there 
are 2.8 million mobile phones, along with 1.7 million fixed 
lines.  The Communications Minister could accept the 
commission\'s recommendations, reject them or refer them back 
for further consideration. 
 
The industry\'s views 
-------------------- 
5. (U) TELECOM: The former state-owned monopoly, Telecom New 
Zealand, has a 45.4 percent share of the mobile phone market 
and roughly 75 percent of the fixed-line market.  In its 
submission to the Commerce Commission, Telecom plans to 
argue that its mobile termination rates are not excessively 
high.  Bruce Parkes, Telecom\'s general manager of government 
and industry relations, said the submission would make two 
principal assertions.  First, the cost of infrastructure 
needed to provide mobile telephone service to a relatively 
small population -- 4 million people -- is high in per- 
capita terms because a large number of cell tower sites are 
required to cover the nation\'s mountainous terrain, 
especially in comparison to countries such as Australia and 
the United Kingdom.  Second, the higher mobile termination 
rates \"cross-subsidize\" lower mobile phone service prices, 
making the telecommunications market more efficient. 
 
6. (SBU) VODAFONE: The company has a 54.6 percent share of 
the mobile telephone market and has been gaining new mobile 
subscribers faster than Telecom.  Vodafone New Zealand 
asserted that mobile termination rates have steadily dropped 
from US 33 cents (NZ 50 cents) in 1998 to less than US 20 
cents (NZ 30 cents) this year and that the market should see 
that trend continue without regulation.  Roger Ellis, 
Vodafone\'s public policy manager, also contended that it is 
unfair to compare termination rates in New Zealand -- where 
the calling party pays for making calls to mobile phones -- 
to those in the United States -- where the receiving party 
pays.  He said New Zealand\'s rates would not be viewed as 
particularly high if they were compared to rates in Europe, 
where the calling party also pays. 
 
7. (U) TELSTRA CLEAR:  Telecom\'s main land-line competitor, 
TelstraClear believes mobile termination rates in New 
Zealand are excessively high and therefore endorsed the 
Commerce Commission\'s investigation.  Grant Forsyth, 
TelstraClear\'s manager of industry and regulatory affairs, 
said the rates should be more in line with those recommended 
by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 
(ACCC), which decided in June that termination fees in the 
country should be lowered gradually from US 14.6 cents (AUS 
21 cents) per minute to US 8.3 cents (AUS 12 cents) on 
January 1, 2007. 
 
8. (SBU) The comments by Telecom and TelstraClear have been 
relayed to AT&T, which requested that post contact the two 
companies on the mobile termination rate issue. 
 
Comment 
------- 
9. (SBU) The Commerce Commission has been inconsistent in 
its approach to regulation, most recently reversing the 
decision in its draft report and recommending against local 
loop unbundling (reftel).  The commission, nonetheless, has 
tended to favor increased regulatory pressure in situations 
where it might increase competition in the 
telecommunications market.  This tendency suggests it may 
recommend regulating mobile termination rates.  Telecom\'s 
Parkes, even as he defended the current rates, implied they 
probably would face mandatory reductions.  Parkes said that 
he expected the ACCC decision to influence the Commerce 
Commission and that if the commission decides to regulate 
rates, the outcome would be similar to that in Australia.

Middle East and Africa Division, New Zealand Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT.)  Despite strong support for 
the U.S. position, Turley stated that the GoNZ is deferring a 
final decision on its vote until it has seen the final text 
of the UNGA resolution.  Turley noted that the GoNZ agreed 
that the issue should not have been referred to the ICJ, and 
had publicly called for Israel to cease construction of the 
wall and return to the negotiating table.  Turley referred to 
a statement by New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Phil 
Goff, which noted that the wall is a barrier to the concept 
of a two-state solution, and impeded the right of the 
Palestinians to self-determination.  In his statement, Goff 
took the opportunity to call for the implementation of the 
Roadmap promoted by the U.S., UN, EU and Russia-- which New 
Zealand fully supports. 
 
2. (U) Begin Text of NZ FM Goff statement: 
 
Hon. Phil Goff 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
Media Statement 
10 July 2004 
 
New Zealand has welcomed a strong ruling by the International 
Court of Justice that Israel\'s West bank barrier is illegal 
and that construction of it should be stopped immediately. 
 
Foreign Minister Phil Goff said the International Court, by 
an overwhelming 14-1 majority, had found that the barrier\'s 
construction was &tantamount to annexation8 and impeded the 
Palestinians, right to self-determination. 
 
&This decision comes on top of a recent Israeli High Court 
decision requiring the Israeli Defence Force to look again at 
the route of part of the wall,8 Mr. Goff said. 
 
&Israel needs to take serious note of the court\'s ruling, 
and of international opinion.  While it has a valid right to 
protect its people from suicide bombings, the construction of 
any wall should be on its legal 1967 border. 
 
&A combination of the wall built deep into occupied 
territory and the continued building of Israeli settlements 
on land it does not have rights to under international law, 
makes Israel\'s action look like de facto annexation. 
 
&I have personally seen the impact that the wall has had on 
Palestinian people; isolating towns, separating farmers from 
their land, and dividing families. 
 
&Even the Israeli High Court has ruled that the hardships 
experienced by Palestinians because of the wall were 
disproportionate to any benefit Israeli received through 
protection of its citizens. 
 
&The wall is a barrier to the concept of a two-state 
solution and to implementing the Roadmap promoted by the 
United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia, 
which New Zealand supports 
 
&New Zealand reiterates its own call for Israel to cease 
construction of the wall, in line with the International 
Court\'s ruling.  Both sides must come back to the negotiating 
table, which is the only path for achieving a sustainable 
peace,8 Mr. Goff said. 
 
End text. 
 
3. (C/NF) Comment:  Although the GoNZ agrees that the focus 
should remain on the Roadmap as a means to a peaceful 
settlement, it is unlikely to convert from an abstention to a 
no vote.  The GoNZ prides itself on its multi-lateral 
credentials and increasingly looks to the NAM for cover.  On 
this as on other issues, the GoNZ will likely see converting 
to a no vote as undermining NZ\'s ability to work with a 
\"broad range\" of parties (read NAM) in the UN.

1. (SBU) Maori activist Tariana Turia used her decisive win 
in a July 10 by-election to launch the Maori Party, with 
herself as its first MP.  Turia easily regained her seat in 
Parliament after resigning her Labour Party Government seat 
in May protest over the government\'s stance on Maori claims 
to NZ\'s foreshore and seabed.  Turia and Maori Party 
co-leader Pita Sharples pledged to challenge the current 
Labour Party incumbents in the seven Parliamentary seats 
reserved for Maori, but it is yet unclear whether they will 
run candidates for non-reserved Parliamentary seats in the 
2005 general election. 
 
2. (U) Prime Minister Helen Clark said her Labour Party would 
not court Maori Party support, despite Labour\'s razor-thin, 
single-vote majority in Parliament.  Labour has already 
indicated that they challenge Turia again in the 2005 
election and expect to regain the seat.  Clark also moved to 
secure the support of the remaining Maori MPs by dividing 
Turia\'s former portfolios among them. 
 
3. (U) Turnout for the by-election was low, with over 8,500 
votes cast of an eligible 26,000 voters.  (Note: Turia was 
elected a Labour MP with 10,002 votes in 2003.) Members of 
the Maori Party blamed voter apathy for the low turnout, with 
volunteers reporting that over 30 percent of all eligible 
voters contacted were unaware the by-election was occurring. 
Party organizers also pointed to the quarter of eligible 
Maori whose electoral roll information was incorrect. 
 
4. (C) Comment: Maori political movements in the past have 
found it difficult to form a coherent policy based solely on 
race and have often been hi-jacked by extremist elements. 
With a majority of Maori tribal leaders either advocating a 
politically neutral stance or backing Labour, it is unlikely 
that Turia\'s personal mandate will automatically translate 
into sustained Maori support for a new party.

DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL IN WAKE OF SPY SCANDAL 
 
Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION, DAVID R. BURNETT FOR REASONS 1. 
5(B,D) 
 
1. (U) In an escalating diplomatic row, two Israeli men were 
sentenced July 14 by the High Court of New Zealand to six 
months in jail on charges of trying to obtain a false New 
Zealand passport.  The GoNZ has not pursued allegations that 
the men are agents of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. 
While Prime Minister Helen Clark would not confirm which 
service employed the men, she noted \"if one were to lay 
espionage charges, one would have to be prepared to offer the 
kind of evidence in court which our intelligence agencies 
don\'t like coming forward to display.  We have very strong 
grounds for believing these are Israeli intelligence agents.\" 
 Israeli citizens Uriel Zoshe Kelman and Eli Cara were 
sentenced to six months in jail, and ordered to each make a 
NZ$50,000 (US35,000) donation to the Cerebral Palsy Society. 
(Note: In attempting to procure a passport, they had procured 
the birth certificate of a cerebral palsy sufferer.)  The 
light sentence reflected the fact that the two men were not 
the principal actors in the plot, which was led by Israeli 
Zev William Barkan, who has fled New Zealand and is still 
wanted.  Cara and Kelman pled guilty earlier this month to 
three charges, including attempting to obtain a New Zealand 
passport and participating in an organized crime group to 
obtain a false passport, and faced a maximum sentence of five 
years.  The latter charge is a relatively new provision in 
the New Zealand Crimes Act, designed to counter transnational 
crime. 
 
Fallout - \"Strict Constraints\" 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) Prime Minister Helen Clark suspended high-level 
contact with Israel and announced a range of diplomatic 
sanctions, including placing Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade (MFAT) officials under \"strict constraints\" in their 
contact with Israelis.  Clark justified her actions by 
stating \"the Israeli agents attempted to demean the integrity 
of the New Zealand passport system.  The Israeli Government 
was asked for an explanation and an apology three months ago. 
 Neither has been received.\"  Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan 
Shalom responded via radio, saying \"we are sorry about this 
matter.  It will be dealt with and all will be done to 
restore Israel\'s long history of good relations with New 
Zealand.\"  Clark refused to accept this informal apology. 
She has announced New Zealand will continue plans to require 
Israeli officials to apply for visas, to postpone all Israeli 
consultations this year, and to delay the agrement for a new 
Israeli Ambassador, resident in Australia.  Israel\'s 
president, Moshe Katsov, was expected to visit New Zealand in 
August, but the GoNZ will likely refuse his request. 
 
3. (SBU) In a separate, but possibly related incident, a 
Jewish cemetery in Wellington was vandalized July 15, and 
headstones were desecrated.  Clark immediately condemned the 
attack. 
 
4. (C) Comment: The GoNZ\'s public reaction is its strongest 
diplomatic retaliation in 20 years ) since French spies 
bombed the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbor in 1985. 
Clark\'s limitations on diplomatic contact go further than the 
GoNZ reaction in 1985, however, and it was reported that she 
toughened the language of her response from that put forward 
by MFAT.  The GONZ has little to lose by such stringent 
action, with limited contact and trade with Israel, and 
possibly something to gain in the Arab world, as the GoNZ is 
establishing an Embassy in Egypt and actively pursuing trade 
with Arab states.  With Israeli Government officials eager to 
repair the relationship, and no time limit on the GoNZ\'s 
restrictions, it is possible the issue may be resolved in six 
months, when the Cara and Kelman have served their time, and 
leave the country.

2.  (U) The GNZ has been quick to renounce any sympathy for 
Hamas.  PM Clark noted that Hamas should not take comfort 
from the GoNZ\'s actions, and if Hamas agents had committed 
the same crimes, they would be subject to the same 
prosecution.  Domestic media reported separately that a 
religious terrorism professor at Auckland University 
suggested that NZ\'s position offers New Zealand military 
serving in Iraq \"protection.\" 
 
3. (C) Comment: New Zealand continues to voice its strong 
support of the Roadmap, but is loathe to take actions that 
would identify it as a supporter of Israel and, by proxy, the 
United States.  The GoNZ prides itself on its multi-lateral 
credentials (ref B) but has been increasingly trying to stand 
alongside \"Non-Aligned\" countries.  Its overly strong 
reaction to Israel over this issue suggests the GNZ sees this 
flap as an opportunity to bolster its credibility with the 
Arab community, and by doing so, perhaps, help NZ lamb and 
other products gain greater access to a larger and more 
lucrative market.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND:  WHAT NUCLEAR ISSUE?  PM CLARK 
PUBLICLY CITES MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT AND MIL-MIL 
INTERACTION AS SIGN NUKE ISSUE IS FADING 
 
 
Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION, DAVID R. BURNETT, 
FOR REASONS 1.5(B,D) 
 
1. (SBU) In comments about the US-New Zealand relationship, 
NZ Prime Minister Helen Clark told Australia\'s ABC radio July 
8 \"I must say that I personally have met George Bush a number 
of times and consider the personal relationship between us to 
be very good.\"  Making a direct link between those meetings 
and NZ\'s anti-nuclear stance, PM Clark added that she was 
\"optimistic that over time what happened over 20 years ago 
will be of less and less relevance to these relationships.\" 
Clark went on to say that the world had moved on from the 
ANZUS agreement of 1951, and signaled her belief that NZ 
would not gain from reinstating the Alliance, which the US 
suspended in 1987 in response to the GoNZ\'s anti-nuclear 
legislation.  Blaming the USG for having made NZ\'s 
anti-nuclear legislation \"a problem\" between the two nations 
and noting that NZ was \"absolutely entitled\" to make its 
nuclear-free stand, Clark went on to state that overall, NZ\'s 
nuclear stance did not impinge upon \"practical\" mil-mil 
interaction between the US and New Zealand, citing GoNZ 
participation in Operation Enduring Freedom as an example. 
She did concede, however, that her government\'s anti-nuclear 
legislation caused \"a generic problem when it comes to 
(military) training.\" 
 
2. (C) Comment: PM Clark\'s statements are about as close and 
as blunt as she\'s ever come to confessing something this post 
has long observed - that the GoNZ has convinced itself that 
naturally friendly but incidental meetings between POTUS and 
Clark, together with the inevitably increased mil-mil 
operations tempo due to NZ\'s OEF and Iraq contributions, is 
proof that GoNZ policies are wearing down USG resolve on the 
nuclear issue.  We further note that PM Clark is apparently 
much more willing to highlight her excellent relations with 
President Bush when speaking to an Australian audience than 
to domestic Kiwi audiences.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER REITERATES VIEW THAT 
NUCLEAR RIFT IS \"FINISHED BUSINESS\" 
 
Classified By: Political and Economic Counselor, 
Timothy Zuniga-Brown, FOR REASONS 1.5(B,D) 
 
1. (SBU/NF) Summary: New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark 
reiterated her position on NZ\'s anti-nuclear policy in 
comments to local media July 25:  \"I\'m not looking for 
compromises.  I\'m perfectly satisfied with the policy.  As 
far as I am concerned, (the US-NZ nuclear dispute) is 
finished business.\"  The PM\'s comments were made in response 
to questions posed by a respected national reporter following 
backgrounders by Embassy Wellington.  The resulting 
well-balanced articles belied the Prime Minister\'s claims 
that the issue is \"finished business.\"  The articles 
addressed a number of issues that Post has highlighted both 
publicly and privately in recent months ) the uncounted cost 
of NZ\'s policies and the increasing irrelevance of the 
legislation in a Post-Cold War security environment.  The 
weekend press coverage continues a welcome internal 
nation-wide dialogue on the nuclear issue.  End summary. 
 
\"It is finished business\" - or is it? 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Following on series of backgrounders by Embassy 
Wellington, respected Sunday Star-Times reporter Jonathan 
Milne wrote a series of well-balanced articles July 25 that 
addressed a number of points on the nuclear issues that Post 
has highlighted both publicly and privately in recent months 
) the uncounted cost of New Zealand\'s policies and the 
increasing irrelevance of the legislation in a Post-Cold War 
security environment.  Milne pointed to the decision to base 
U.S. Coastguard icebreakers in Hobart, Australia, the loss of 
business opportunities for businesses that refit military 
equipment, the loss of US training opportunities for the NZ 
Defence Force and the subsequent higher price paid for 
military training and hardware as evidence that the 
legislation is not cost-free to NZ.  He noted further that 
the reputed trade and tourism benefit of NZ\'s vaunted 
nuclear-free image has never been quantified.  A second 
article focused on the financial benefits accrued by 
Townsville, Australia.  The article noted that while 
Townsville previously designated itself a \"nuclear-free zone\" 
in the 1980s, it now welcomes American ship visits and has 
added millions of dollars to its local economy as a result. 
 
3. (SBU/NF) Prime Minister Helen Clark is quoted by Milne as 
responding to his story by flatly stating \"I\'m not looking 
for compromises.  I\'m perfectly satisfied with the policy. 
As far as I am concerned, (the US-NZ nuclear dispute) is 
finished business.\"  Clark further stressed her view that the 
US-NZ nuclear problem is increasingly \"irrelevant,\" and 
solely due to the USG\'s stubborn adherence to its \"neither 
confirm nor deny\" policy.  She goes on to note that the 
nuclear-free legislation is an issue that \"New Zealand and 
America have put to the side for 20 years.\"  Milne\'s 
conclusion is that neither the GoNZ nor the USG are willing 
to compromise further to solve the impasse created by NZ\'s 
adoption of anti-nuclear legislation that resulted in a ban 
on visits by USG military vessels to New Zealand. 
 
4. (SBU/NF) Milne\'s third article, appearing under the 
misleading title \"US makes nukes blunder,\" revealed an 
incident in December 2003 when the US Army landing craft USS 
Great Bridge sought permission for a USD 1.4 million refit in 
a New Zealand dockyard.  After being reminded of the USG ban 
on military ship visits, the vessel was redirected to 
Australia.  Milne reports that the GoNZ apparently was not 
aware of any intended visit and claimed it had not been 
notified by the USG of the specific incident.  Milne\'s 
article posited that the USG lost a chance to break the 
20-year diplomatic stalemate, noting that PM Clark claimed it 
was &highly likely8 that a request for such a refit would 
have been approved once it was determined that the ship fit 
NZ\'s anti-nuclear legislation. 
 
COMMENT: (Un)Finished Business? 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) PM Clark\'s comments confirm that she is not only 
comfortable with her government\'s stance on the nuclear 
dispute with the USG, but that she also firmly wishes that it 
will just go away.  That a leading Kiwi reporter can write a 
well-balanced series of stories in one of New Zealand\'s 
leading newspapers suggests the issue is not as \"finished\" as 
the PM would like it to be.  The series of articles continues 
a surprising but welcome internal discussion among New 
Zealanders that has been going on for nearly two years. 
Still, the Prime Minister\'s statements reaffirm post\'s view 
on the need for all US agencies to reinforce USG policy with 
New Zealand government interlocutors - both civilian and 
military.

1. (C) Post delivered reftel talking points and statement to 
the GNZ, but was careful to acknowledge the GNZ\'s clearly 
stated position that New Zealand is NOT/NOT a member of the 
Coalition.  New Zealand has consistently indicated that the 
presence of 61 NZ military engineers in Basra is in 
fulfillment of its responsibilities as a UN member to UN 
Security Council resolutions (including 1483). 
 
2. (U) New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark implicitly 
criticized the Philippine government July 27 for withdrawing 
its contingent from Iraq after one of its citizens was taken 
hostage.  PM Clark told local media July 27 that \"if you 
allow yourself to be pushed around like that, you simply 
invite hostage-taking.\"  Clark noted that she had 
consistently told New Zealanders that if they went to Iraq 
and were kidnapped the GNZ would not help them. 
 
3. (U) NZ Foreign Minister Phil Goff told local media that 
giving in to hostage-takers\' demands only made kidnappings 
more likely.  Goff said he could \"understand the angst the 
Philippine government felt, but it\'s a matter of long 
practice and common sense that, when the demands of 
terrorists are acceded to, then their activities are 
encouraged, not diminished.\"  He added that if a New 
Zealander were held hostage, the GNZ would do all it could to 
negotiate for the hostage\'s well being but would not bow to 
terrorist demands.   Goff pointed out that \"if the 
consequences are, in saving one life, that it results in the 
loss of dozens of other lives, then that clearly was not the 
right decision to take.\"  Goff made similar remarks to the 
media at a recent joint press event with Australian Foreign 
Minister Downer.

 1.  (SBU) Embassy Wellington learned July 30 that GNZ 
Cabinet Minister for the Environment Marian Hobbs was 
reportedly hosting a special screening of Michael Moore\'s 
controversial movie \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" as a local Labour Party 
fundraising event.  DCM contacted the Prime Minister\'s office 
to ask whether it could shed some light on the matter and was 
told by PM office staff that they were not aware of the issue 
but would look into it.  DCM then contacted Minister Hobbs\' 
office but the Minister\'s office declined to make her 
available to discuss the matter.  Hobbs\' staff later informed 
Embassy that Hobbs would not be hosting the fundraiser. 
However, she would be attending the event. 
 
2. (C) COMMENT:  There\'s a reason this particular Minister is 
nicknamed \"Boo Boo\" Hobbs.  That said, it is probable that 
this potential fiasco may only have been averted because of 
our phone calls - it is apparent to us that neither the 
Minister nor anyone else in the Labour government seems to 
have thought there was anything wrong with a senior Minister 
hosting such an event.  Ambassador will use a scheduled 
meeting with the Prime Minister to tell Clark of the near 
instantaneous press queries for USG comment in this matter 
and remind her that we would really rather not get dragged 
into internal NZ political issues, such as Ministerial 
fundraising events for Clark\'s Labour Party.

(C) The GoNZ does not object to the release of the 
Multinational Force (MNF) Statement on Terrorism as written 
ref A.  Bronwyn Evans-Kent, Security Policy Division, New 
Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), noted 
that the document was still being circulated among MFAT 
divisions, but no objections were anticipated.  Should there 
be any concerns over specific language, these would be 
provided to Washington by COB August 2.  She referred to 
strong public statements by the NZ Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister (ref B) regarding NZ\'s policy of not making 
concessions to terrorists.  Evans-Kent also reiterated that 
the GoNZ is not engaged in Iraq as part of the Coalition, and 
preferred the Statement on Terrorism with the MNF moniker.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND FOCUSES ON REFORM OF PACIFIC ISLAND 
FORUM 
 
REF: STATE 151991 
 
1. (U) On July 27, Poloff shared ref A points on the 2004 
Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) with Paul Willis, Regional Deputy 
Director, Pacific Division, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade.  Willis indicated that Prime Minister 
Helen Clark would lead the New Zealand delegation to the PIF, 
as New Zealand is outgoing Chair of the Forum.  However, she 
will be departing for Tokelau August 7 ) 10, and Foreign 
Minister Phil Goff will head the delegation on those dates. 
Goff is currently scheduled for a bi-lateral with A/S Kelly 
on August 8. 
 
2. (U) Willis noted that the GoNZ\'s primary focus for the 
Forum would be continuing the momentum on PIF reform 
generated by the release of the Pacific Plan.  Willis 
outlined additional higher priority GoNZ agenda items, 
including HIV/AIDS and the threat of other communicable 
diseases, specifically the implementation of the SPC regional 
strategy on disease.  In terms of the Australia-crafted 
Pacific Regional Transport Strategy, the GoNZ was firmly 
behind the Australians.  They would be pressing for follow-up 
on security and transport issues that have stalled in recent 
months.  Willis also noted a few issues that were likely to 
appear on the margins of discussion.  He advised that the 
GoNZ would likely support French Polynesia\'s candidacy for 
observer status at the Forum, noting that they had fulfilled 
the obligations for such a position.  Climate change would be 
discussed, but was seen as a much less contentious issue than 
at last year\'s meeting.  Willis theorized that the Government 
of Nauru would appeal for broader regional assistance, but 
this would take place at the Leader\'s Retreat, and not in the 
formal session.

TAGS: APER, AMGT, NZ 
SUBJECT: (U) NSDD-38 REQUEST FOR NEW POSITION IN WELLINGTON 
 
REF: STATE 138636 
 
Classified By: AMB. CHARLES J. SWINDELLS FOR REASON 1.5 (C). 
 
1.  (S) The National Security Agency (NSA) has requested a 
new, permanent position in Wellington attached to, but not 
residing at, the Embassy (reftel) - a Deputy Special U.S. 
Liaison Officer.  Based on a thorough review of the policy 
and resource implications of this request, the Ambassador 
recommends that the State Department approve this request. 
He believes that the potential benefits of the new position 
-- in terms of closer signals intelligence cooperation with 
New Zealand -- far outweigh the additional administrative 
burden it will place on the Embassy. 
 
2.  (S) The Ambassador\'s recommendation reflects the 
following analysis.  The new position will advance US 
interests in New Zealand by improving liaison and cooperation 
on vital signals intelligence matters.  This is an area where 
the US and NZ already work together closely and profitably, 
and continuing to build and expand that relationship clearly 
stands to benefit both countries.  This is especially true in 
the post-September 11 environment, where NZ sigint 
capabilities significantly enhance our common efforts to 
combat terrorism in the region and the world.  The Embassy 
already has a close working relationship with the NZ 
Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) that will be 
enhanced by the establishment of this new position.  Embassy 
also has an understanding with NSA that the new position will 
cover Congressionally mandated information security 
requirements that neither the Defense Attache Office nor our 
State officers have the technical expertise to undertake. 
 
3.  (S) On administrative matters, the GCSB will provide the 
new NSA officer with office space; office furniture; 
computer, telephone and other equipment and supplies.  NSA 
will fully fund the position and will pay for housing and 
purchase all residential furnishings directly.  NSA will 
contract with the Embassy for the following ICASS services: 
Basic Package; Community Liaison Office services; Financial 
Management Services (medium level support); General Services 
(low level support); and Short-Term Residential Lease 
Building Operations.  As a result of these arrangements, the 
resource impact of the new position on this Special Embassy 
Program post will be minimized, and can be fully absorbed 
within post\'s current ICASS system. 
 
4.  (S) Based on the scenario above, there should be no 
start-up costs associated with this new position.  Using 
Embassy\'s FY 2004 service costs as a base, the total annual 
estimated cost of providing ICASS services is USD 23,649. 
 
5.  (S) Embassy recommends that Washington agencies determine 
the appropriate level and type of accreditation for this new 
position.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PRESSES PM CLARK ON IRAN NUCLEAR ISSUE 
 
REF: WELLINGTON 599 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles J. Swindells, Reasons 1.5 (B and D) 
 
1. (SBU)  Ambassador Swindells met with New Zealand Prime 
Minister Helen Clark on August 3 to touch base on a number of 
issues.   DCM accompanied as notetaker.  The PM was backed by 
acting Senior Policy Advisor Brook Barrington and Americas 
Division Director (A/S equivalent) Roy Ferguson. 
 
2. (C)  The Ambassador noted the number of questions he had 
been taking from university and civic group audiences on 
Iran\'s nuclear program and pointed to recent press articles 
highlighting growing concern in New Zealand on the subject. 
He explained to the PM that the United States remains very 
concerned as well, and has been looking to the international 
community to step up and provide leadership.  He applauded 
New Zealand\'s recently announced commitments to the 
Proliferation Security Inititiative and the G-8 Global 
Partnership, and wondered what role the GONZ saw for itself 
on Iran.  PM Clark replied that New Zealand shared USG 
concern over developments in the Iran nuclear program, and 
was looking at how best to bring effective pressure to bear 
on the Iranians.  She said New Zealand had hoped the European 
effort would bear fruit, but the Europeans had been 
disappointed by Iran\'s subterfuge and hard-line response. 
Clark said the Iranian Foreign Minister would be in New 
Zealand August 23-24, adding that she would use the occasion 
to deliver \"a very strong message.\"  (Comment:  The PM did 
not reveal what other steps New Zealand might take to show 
leadership on this crucial non-proliferation issue (see 
reftel).  End Comment.) 
 
3. (U)  The Ambassador updated the PM on his fund-raising 
efforts for the Platinum Triangle Scholarship Program under 
the auspices of Fulbright New Zealand, and thanked her for 
the GONZ\'s funding contribution. Clark said she was pleased 
to see the private sector response to the new scholarship, 
was delighted with the Embassy\'s initiative in getting the 
program going and was happy to have made a contribution.  She 
suggested that the program be announced before the end of 
August, and offered to participate in the roll-out.  The 
Ambassador said that timing would be perfect, and suggested 
that it be followed up in January-February, 2005 by a photo 
opportunity and meeting with as many of the private sector 
participants as possible.  The PM said she would be in New 
Zealand during that timeframe and agreed it would be good to 
highlight the public-private nature of the scholarship 
program.  The Ambassador informed the PM that he expected the 
first scholarship recipient to be named in April, 2005. 
 
4. (C)  The Ambassador and PM discussed the upcoming Pacific 
Islands Forum meeting in Apia. Ambassador Swindells 
congratulated PM Clark for the hard, but effective, work New 
Zealand had done in setting up the PIF secretariat and giving 
governance issues top priority.  The PM said New Zealand had 
done its best to contribute to progress in the South Pacific, 
adding that it would now be up to the secretariat to keep 
momentum.  She expressed concern that secretariat head Greg 
Urwin had \"seemed pretty quiet lately.\"  Clark said she 
looked forward to meeting with Assistant Secretary Kelly in 
Apia. 
 
5. (C)  On the margins of the meeting, We passed a copy of 
the MNF Counterterrorism language to policy advisor 
Barrington, since he was preparing a briefing paper on the 
issue for the NZ Cabinet.  We noted that in light of New 
Zealand\'s previously strong public reaction to the 
Philippines\' pull-out from Iraq, our expectation was that New 
Zealand would strongly support our message.  Barrington 
agreed that it would look like a climb-down if the GONZ did

1. (U) The GoNZ issued a press statement August 5 in support 
of the Multinational Force Iraq Statement on Terrorism (ref 
a).  Foreign Minister Phil Goff reiterated statements 
condemning hostage takers (ref b) and affirming the GoNZ\'s 
pledge not to negotiate with terrorists. 
 
2. (U) Begin Text: 
 
Press Release by New Zealand Government at 05 Aug 2004 
 
Foreign Minister Phil Goff today reiterated New Zealand\'s 
condemnation of on-going terrorist attacks in Iraq as brutal 
and pointless. 
 
Mr. Goff\'s comments support a statement by the Multinational 
Force condemning terrorist activities in Iraq and calling on 
countries not to bow to terrorists, demands. 
 
\"New Zealand did not support the military invasion of Iraq. 
However it strongly backs the United Nations-mandated 
political process now under way as restoring to Iraqis the 
power to determine their own future,8 Mr. Goff said. 
 
\"Terrorist attacks by dissident and foreign elements are 
mainly victimizing Iraqi people and standing in the way of 
self-determination and improved social and economic 
conditions. 
 
\"New Zealand also utterly condemns the taking and killing of 
hostages.  We sympathize with the appalling situation faced 
by government whose citizens are taken hostage and threatened 
with execution unless terrorist demands are met. 
 
\"However we have stated firmly that giving in to such demands 
increases the probability of others being taken hostage and 
killed. 
 
\"I can only repeat the warnings we have issued to New 
Zealanders traveling to or in Iraq.  The situation there is 
so dangerous that it does not justify the risk. 
 
\"If New Zealanders get into trouble in Iraq there is little 
the government can do to assist.  We could not meet the 
conditions likely to be demanded to secure the release of any 
New Zealander held hostage there. 
 
\"Our message is clear ) New Zealanders should not go to 
Iraq, and those who are there should leave,\" Mr. Goff said. 
 
End text. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  While on record as supporting the general 
principles expressed in the MNF Statement (ref b), the GoNZ 
struggled over whether it should publicly support the USG\'s 
announcement.  Both the Prime Minister\'s office and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) expressed 
concern (ref c) over the logistics on the MNF Statement, 
specifically whether or not a list of supporting countries 
would be attached to the Statement.  MFAT representatives 
repeatedly referred to the GoNZ\'s clearly stated position 
that New Zealand is NOT/NOT a member of the Coalition, 
stating that the presence of 61 NZ military engineers in 
Basra is in fulfillment of its responsibilities as a UN 
member to UN Security Council resolutions (including 1483). 
While we should privately note the GoNZ ultimately did issue 
a concurrent statement supportive of our MNF stance, we 
should also fully note FM Goff\'s pointed reference to New 
Zealand\'s opposition to the invasion of Iraq and that the 
GoNZ has no desire to be associated with USG actions in Iraq. 
 
4. (U) Minimize considered.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO BOTH RELAX AND 
TOUGHEN RULES FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
 
REF: 03 WELLINGTON 1247 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified - protect accordingly. 
 
2. (SBU) Summary: Proposed changes to the New Zealand 
government\'s review of foreign investments would reduce the 
scope of business deals requiring its review while 
tightening the screening of land purchases by foreigners. 
The government is trying to strike a balance between its 
desire to arrest a five-year slide in foreign investment and 
the public\'s wish to keep so-called iconic sites and large 
stretches of shoreline out of foreign ownership.  The rules\' 
impact on U.S. business investors is expected to be slight, 
although they will complicate some land purchases by 
Americans.  End summary. 
 
3. (U) The proposed rules, approved by cabinet July 5 and 
announced July 20, must be incorporated into legislation and 
then face a parliamentary vote.  If approved, they most 
likely would take effect July 1, 2005, according to Stephen 
Dawe, chief executive officer of the New Zealand Overseas 
Investment Commission (OIC), which since 1973 has 
administered the government\'s foreign investment policies. 
The new rules would lift the threshold for scrutiny of 
proposed business purchases from NZ $50 million (US $32.6 
million) to NZ $100 million (US $65.2 million), where a 
foreigner is proposing to take control of 25 percent or more 
of a business. 
 
4. (U) For purchases of rural land of more than 12.35 acres 
and for land in certain sensitive or protected areas, 
foreigners would have to provide a management proposal 
covering any historic, heritage, conservation or public 
access matters and any economic development planned.  That 
proposal would have to be approved and made a condition of 
consent.  In addition, investors would be required to report 
at one- or two-year intervals on their compliance with the 
terms of the consent.  (The government\'s proposal continues 
existing rules requiring approval for acquisition of rural 
land of more than five hectares, or 12.35 acres, and for 
land in certain sensitive or protected areas, including most 
offshore islands or next to the foreshore.)  The rules would 
ease restrictions on purchases of urban land. 
 
5. (SBU) The new rules are expected to have minimal impact 
on decisions by U.S. investors to buy New Zealand 
businesses.  The proposed rules would have eliminated the 
required review of at least four U.S. proposals submitted in 
2003, or nearly 6 percent of all U.S. applications.  Among 
them would be Illinois-based Brunswick Corporation\'s US $33 
million acquisition of a 70 percent stake in Navman, a New 
Zealand company specializing in global positioning systems- 
based products and marine electronics. 
 
6. (U) Moreover, since 1984, the OIC has never rejected a 
foreign investment in New Zealand businesses, which was a 
reason cited by Finance Minister Cullen for changing the 
rules, according to Dawe.  Cullen felt as if he were rubber- 
stamping OIC decisions that should not have needed his -- 
nor the commission\'s -- consideration, Dawe said.  He noted 
that the OIC last year considered 206 applications by U.S. 
interests (including some applications submitted in prior 
years).  The commission rejected eight of those 
applications, which were for land acquisitions and had been 
submitted primarily by Americans who had come to New Zealand 
as tourists. 
 
7. (SBU) U.S. investment applications have declined 33 
percent since 1999, for reasons unrelated to the 
government\'s screening requirement.  While delays and 
compliance costs may deter some potential foreign investors, 
U.S. businesses cite other reasons for their reluctance to 
put their money in New Zealand.  These reasons include the 
government\'s energy and environmental policies, employment 
laws, excessive regulation in certain sectors and tax policy 
(reftel).  The stock of U.S. direct investment in New 
Zealand has shrunk by nearly two thirds in the last five 
years from U.S. $10.3 billion (NZ $15.809 billion) in fiscal 
1998 to an estimated U.S. $3.65 billion (NZ $5.596 billion) 
in 2003.  Nonetheless, the United States ranks second after 
Australia in terms of foreign direct investment in New 
Zealand. 
 
8. (U) In announcing a review of the government\'s foreign 
investment rules on November 10, Cullen stated his desire to 
provide greater protection to sites of special historical, 
cultural or environmental significance.  He also cited the 
need for attracting foreign capital if the country is to 
achieve the government\'s stated goal of returning to the top 
half of OECD rankings.  As a percentage of GDP, foreign 
direct investment in New Zealand peaked at more than 60 
percent in 1998.  It declined to about 40 percent of GDP by 
March 2003. 
 
9. (SBU) The review of investment rules was prompted in part 
by publicity indicating that the OIC may have been lax in 
monitoring compliance by foreign landowners with the 
consents imposed by the agency.  Among the most publicized 
cases was that of American Alan Trent, who bulldozed coastal 
cliff tops for a subdivision of expensive homes.  Americans 
are the leading foreign landholders, but the amount of land 
purchased by foreigners has declined since 1995.  In 2003, 
foreign land purchases fell by more than half from the 
previous year, with 181 foreigners buying 13,427 hectares. 
That drop may be due partly to the fact that there is less 
rural land available to purchase.  In addition, about 30 
percent of New Zealand\'s landmass, or 8 million hectares, 
lies outside the grasp of any private landowner.  These 
lands are managed by the Department of Conservation. 
 
10. (U) Under the government\'s proposal, the OIC\'s functions 
will be transferred to Land Information New Zealand.  The 
OIC\'s nine staff members will be offered the opportunity to 
transfer to the new unit. 
 
11. (SBU) Comment: While easing controls on non-land 
business purchases, the new rules on foreign ownership would 
leave in place a screening mechanism that is considered 
inconsistent with the WTO General Agreement on Trade in 
Services and with the notion that such regimes should be 
unnecessary in developed nations.  In fact, the New Zealand 
Treasury initially recommended scrapping all controls on 
foreign business acquisitions, except for competition 
provisions.  It then proposed raising the threshold to $250 
million (US $163 million), which cabinet ministers scaled 
back.  The go-slow approach may be dictated by politics. 
Leading up to the next election in 2005, the ruling Labour 
Party holds a slim lead in the polls and may need the 
support of the Green Party and New Zealand First -- both 
fervent proponents of keeping New Zealand property in New 
Zealand hands.  Members of the opposition National Party 
also have indicated they might make their desire to protect 
certain land areas from foreign ownership an election issue.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND PARTICIPATION AT APEC HIGH LEVEL 
POLICY DIALOGUE ON AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY 
 
REF:  USDA FAS 666920 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. Embassy\'s Agricultural Attach and Economic officer 
discussed the draft workplan for the APEC High Level 
Policy Dialogue on Agricultural Biotechnology (HLPDAB) 
and ongoing capacity building initiatives on agricultural 
biotechnology with David Walker and Richard Graves of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Dr. Walker was 
recently appointed as the New Zealand Government\'s Senior 
APEC official.  His office had shared information 
provided on the agricultural policy dialogue reftel with 
other New Zealand ministries.  New Zealand\'s 
participation in the Biotech Dialogue is likely to 
continue at a modest level.  This reflects both resource 
constraints as well as policy considerations that take 
into account the political sensitivity of agricultural 
biotechnology within New Zealand. 
 
2. Dr. Walker candidly stated that New Zealand\'s 
\'experts\' on agricultural biotechnology have not in the 
past placed a high priority on participating in the 
HLPDAB.  Based on their assessment and faced with 
significant resource constraints, New Zealand\'s 
participation in the APEC HLPDAB is not likely to change 
significantly in the near-term from its modest level. 
 
3. Agricultural Attach stressed to Dr. Walker the 
importance that the United States places on New Zealand\'s 
participation in the HLPDAB.  The 3-year draft workplan 
offered New Zealand an excellent opportunity to make sure 
that it included initiatives and activities that 
supported New Zealand\'s goals and objectives for 
agricultural biotechnology.  Dr. Walker agreed that New 
Zealand shared responsibility for making sure that the 
workplan was relevant for New Zealand.  Dr. Walker was 
reminded during the discussion that he had received a 
copy of the workplan by email from Melissa Clarkson 
representing the HLPDAB Steering Committee and he was 
encouraged to provide comment directly to Clarkson by 
email, taking into account that feedback was sought by 
August 13. 
 
4. Walker commented that New Zealand would like to obtain 
clarification and a better understanding of the 
definition and scope of agricultural biotechnology, as 
envisioned for the HLPDAB versus other APEC bodies (or 
international organizations such as Codex) providing 
technology cooperation, so as to assure that there was no 
duplication of effort.  Also, New Zealand believes that 
initiatives to enhance public understanding of 
agricultural biotechnology should be a priority issue for 
the HLPDAB.  These concerns may be expressed by Walker in 
an email exchange with Clarkson. 
 
5. Agricultural Attach raised the subject of the farmer- 
to-farmer capacity building initiative scheduled for 
Honduras and the Investment Seminar that will be held in 
Malaysia in December 2004.  With respect to the Honduran 
event, Dr. Walker commented that New Zealand placed 
importance on the need for achieving wider public 
understanding and acceptance of agricultural 
biotechnology.  He also questioned why the event was 
being held in Honduras given that it is not an APEC 
member. 
 
6. Agricultural Attach reminded Dr. Walker of the recent 
trade Mission led by the Governor of Iowa to New Zealand 
followed by a reverse mission organized by MFAT to Iowa 
designed in part to promote investment in biotechnology. 
With New Zealand\'s interest in promoting investment 
opportunities for New Zealand\'s agricultural biotech 
industry, Agricultural Attach raised the usefulness of 
of 
the investment seminar organized under the HLPDAB to 
promote development of New Zealand\'s biotech sector. 
 
7. Dr. Walker emphasized that timing of Policy Dialogue 
meetings was an important factor in determining New 
Zealand\'s participation.  Dr. Walker will attend the 
Senior Officials Meeting (SOM I) that will be held next 
year in Korea.  The 2005 Agricultural Biotechnology 
Policy Dialogue meeting is expected to be scheduled on 
the margins of SOM I.  Richard Graves, MFAT\'s Senior 
Policy Officer for APEC, pointed out that although Dr. 
Walker will be in Korea, he may be unable to attend the 
policy dialogue if it conflicts with preparatory events 
being held for SOM I.  Coordination of APEC meeting 
schedules is critical to ensure New Zealand\'s 
participation at HLPDAB meetings. 
 
COMMENT 
8. Attending the Biotech Policy Dialogue does pose 
serious resource issues for New Zealand, both human and 
financial.  However, its participation is largely a 
question of priorities and benefits.  New Zealand will 
continue to find it difficult to take a leadership role 
in promoting the adoption of biotechnology issues within 
APEC while its own domestic policy environment continues 
to impede development of New Zealand\'s biotech sector. 
That said, David Walker, New Zealand\'s newly appointed 
Senior APEC Official, is likely to place a higher 
priority and take a more active role in the Agricultural 
Biotechnology Dialogue than his predecessor.  Walker 
attended the last HLPDAB meeting held in Chile while 
still serving as Deputy Head of the New Zealand Embassy 
in Washington.

 - Retitle the document from GEO to &The DRAFT Declaration 
on the Establishment of the Global Earth Observation System 
of Systems (GEOSS).8 
 
 - In paragraph 9, soften or remove the language on 
restricting meeting attendance, because it\'s not in line with 
the inclusive nature of the organization. 
 
 - In paragraph 12, the Executive Committee should represent 
diverse needs and priorities of its members. (Note: This is 
New Zealand\'s flag to keep the smaller Pacific nations in 
mind when selecting the Executive Committee.) 
 
- In paragraph 13, there should only be two co-chairs for the 
Executive Committee.  One should represent a developed 
country, and the other a developing country.  The term of the 
co-chairs should be off-set to coordinate the passing on of

IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIRST COMMITTEE 
 
The Permanent Mission of New Zealand to the United Nations 
presents its compliments to the Disarmament and 
Decolonization Affairs Branch and has the honor to refer to 
Note DGACM/DDAB/2004/TR1, which requested the views of member 
states on the issue of improving the effectiveness of the 
methods of work of the First Committee. 
 
New Zealand would like to offer the following suggestions for 
First Committee reform. 
 
- Consideration should be given to shortening the time 
allotted to the Committee.  New Zealand considers that four 
weeks should be sufficient time to enable the Committee to 
complete its work.  The Committee could consider utilizing 
both morning and afternoon sessions.  Even if that is not 
feasible, the following reforms, together with good 
time-keeping, should enable the time currently allotted to 
the Committee to be reduced. 
 
- New Zealand supports shortening the time allowed for 
general debate from two weeks to one, to allow more time for 
specific debate. 
 
- New Zealand would like to see greater incorporation of 
external expertise into the Committee\'s deliberations.  In 
this context, New Zealand would support Ambassador Sareva of 
Finland\'s proposal of interactive debate sessions 
incorporating leading experts from academia and civil 
society.  These discussions, which we agree would 
appropriately span over two-three days, could address current 
key issues, providing focus and context for the Committee\'s 
work. 
 
- Debate should be conducted on the basis of a rolling 
speakers, list.  Once the speakers, list for each topic has 
been exhausted, debate should roll over into the next topic, 
making maximum use of the time available. 
 
- An enforced time limit should be considered for all 
statements.  If countries are aligned with a regional or 
group statement, national statements should be shortened or 
forsaken accordingly. 
 
- Delegations should be encouraged to re-examine the value of 
long-standing resolutions, with an eye to the merit of 
recycling texts with little or no alteration from year to 
year.  If countries feel that such resolutions contain key 
positions which are still relevant, they should consider 
submitting the resolutions on a biennial or triennial basis.

SUBJECT: CODEL SHELBY TALKS TRADE AND SECURITY WITH NZ 
OFFICIALS 
 
REF: STATE 163811 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Codel Shelby met with New Zealand 
officials August 8-9.  Discussions focused on lessons learned 
from New Zealand\'s successful effort to eliminate domestic 
agricultural subsidies, current state of the NZ economy, 
potential for a U.S.-New Zealand FTA and the need to promote 
foreign investment, New Zealand\'s contribution to regional 
security, and the country\'s increasing concerns over 
infrastructure gaps in energy and transportation.  Economic 
Development Minister Jim Anderton hosted dinner for the CODEL 
in Christchurch on August 8.  In Wellington on August 9, the 
CODEL met with Opposition leader Don Brash (and shadow 
Foreign Minister Lockwood Smith), Acting Prime Minister 
Michael Cullen, officials from the Reserve Bank, Defense 
Minister Mark Burton and Trade Minister Jim Sutton.  They 
also had lunch with the top civil servants in the Foreign 
Affairs and Trade, Defense and Justice Ministries and the 
External Assessments Bureau (NSC equivalent).  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Economic Development Minister Jim Anderton hosted 
Senator Richard C. Shelby, Dr. Annette Shelby, Representative 
Robert E. \"Bud\" Cramer and Senate Banking staffer Kathy Casey 
for an August 8 dinner in Christchurch with CEOs of local 
firms representing U.S. high tech companies.  Senator Shelby 
commented on how he had seen New Zealand evolving during 
previous official and private visits, as a result of the 
tough economic reforms introduced by the Lange Government in 
the mid-1980s.  Anderton concurred that the reforms had 
helped shield New Zealand from the results of the Asian 
economic downturn and the recent slowdown in the U.S. 
economy.  However, he said the current government felt that 
some of the reforms might have gone too far.  Anderton cited 
as an example the consolidation of New Zealand banking under 
a handful of Australia-owned banks.  The Minister said he had 
pushed to set up \"Kiwibank,\" a postal banking alternative 
intended to ensure that banking services were available in 
every community in New Zealand.  Kiwibank was now turning a 
small profit and was, in his view, forcing the other banks to 
offer a greater range of services.  Anderton also said the 
Clark Government was looking at whether labor laws had tipped 
the balance of economic benefits too much toward employers. 
 
3.  (SBU) The Minister made a pitch for a U.S.-New Zealand 
Free Trade Agreement, noting concern that the U.S.-Australia 
FTA would divert investment from New Zealand to Australia. 
Senator Shelby said the Congress was well disposed toward New 
Zealand and still generally favored bilateral free trade 
agreements.  The \"unfinished business\" (i.e., NZ\'s ban of 
nuclear-propelled or armed vessels calling at its ports) was 
a complicating factor, but the Senator said he expected 
negotiations with New Zealand to happen \"eventually.\"  Charge 
suggested that in the meantime, there was a great deal New 
Zealand could do to promote foreign investment.  Anderton 
agreed, explaining that the GoNZ was working to streamline 
the Resource Management Act and other investment approval 
legislation to make them more \"friendly\" to both foreign and 
domestic investors.  Anderton\'s spouse, a Christchurch City 
Councilwoman had a good side exchange with Rep. Cramer, 
comparing community development in the Canterbury region with 
the growth of Huntsville, Alabama, in the Congressman\'s 
district. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Opposition Leader Don Brash and National Party 
spokesman for Foreign Affairs Lockwood Smith told CODEL that 
the current government\'s economic policies and defense 
priorities were resulting in New Zealand falling farther and 
farther behind the standard of living of Australia and many 
other OECD countries.  They raised the negative impact of the 
anti-nuclear legislation on New Zealand\'s Defense Forces, but 
offered little hope that the New Zealand public would be 
willing to see the legislation scrapped.  Senator Shelby 
noted the importance the United States attaches to efforts by 
Australia and New Zealand to maintain peace and stability in 
the South Pacific. 
 
5.  (SBU)  CODEL\'s meeting with Finance Minister and acting 
PM Michael Cullen centered on the history of the Lange 
Government\'s economic reforms, in particular the scrapping of 
agricultural subsidies.  Cullen explained the necessity of 
the reforms and agreed with Minister Anderton\'s assessment 
that they might have gone too far in some areas.  With 
respect to agricultural subsidies, Cullen said he had been 
heartened by the progress made on agriculture at the recent 
WTO Council meeting in Geneva.  Senator Shelby agreed that 
progress on ag subsidies was essential to a successful Doha 
Round, but said he hoped the U.S. would not be required to 
get rid of its subsidies \"cold turkey\" as New Zealand had 
done.  Minister Cullen opined that it would be a lot easier 
politically to hide behind the WTO in ratcheting down 
domestic agricultural support. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Cullen also gave a brief overview of the current 
state of New Zealand\'s economy, stressing the important role 
of domestic investment, especially in residential 
construction.  He cited energy security and upgrading 
transport infrastructure as the major questions that could 
impede future growth.  The Minister also outlined how New 
Zealand\'s superannuation fund, a social security supplement, 
would work to address the increased fiscal demands posed by 
an aging population.  Senator Shelby said social security 
reform would be a tough issue, but one that would require 
rapid action by the incoming Congress after the U.S. 
elections.  Senator Shelby and Rep. Cramer had an instructive 
exchange with Cullen (who is often Labour\'s floor manager) 
contrasting party discipline in the New Zealand parliament 
with the freedom and power accorded individual members of the 
U.S. Congress, and of the Congress in general relative to the 
Executive Branch. 
 
6.  (SBU)  The CODEL met for nearly an hour with NZ Reserve 
Bank Deputy Governor Adrian Orr and Special Advisor Bruce 
White.  Orr and White reviewed the Reserve Bank\'s bank 
supervision role, and discussed how the Bank maintained price 
stability despite a fairly overheated domestic economy.  Orr 
also went over the results of New Zealand\'s privatization 
program, a key element of the mid-1980\'s economic reforms. 
He explained that a few sectors were still state-owned, 
including most education, health, electricity production and 
distribution, rail lines and the national air carrier, Air 
New Zealand. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Over lunch with senior civil servants, the CODEL 
discussed New Zealand\'s regional security concerns and 
contributions.  Defense CEO Graham Fortune outlined defense 
spending priorities and discussed the 2003 reorganization of 
the New Zealand Defense Forces.  MFAT CEO Simon Murdoch and 
External Assessments Bureau Advisor Hessel Baas identified 
regional security concerns in the South Pacific, focusing 
particular attention on governance issues in some of the 
Pacific Island States.  Justice CEO Belinda Clark reviewed 
her Ministry\'s efforts at capacity building in the island 
states. 
 
8.  (SBU)  At the Defense Ministry, Senator Shelby thanked 
Defense Minister Burton for New Zealand\'s contribution to the 
war on terror, noting in particular the efforts of Kiwi 
troops in Afghanistan and the combat engineering contingent 
in Iraq.  Burton reviewed New Zealand\'s upgrade planes for 
its navy and its P-3 Orion ocean surveillance fleet.  The 
Minister said a major component of the latter project would 
be done by a firm in Birmingham, Alabama. The Senator 
congratulated Burton, who is also Tourism Minister, on the 
successful tourism promotion campaign linked to the movie 
series \"Lord of the Rings.\"  The Minister said he had been 
very pleased by the increase in tourism sparked by the movies 
and subsequent ad campaign. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Trade Minister Sutton outlined for the CODEL what 
had transpired at the WTO General Council Meeting in Geneva 
at the end of July.  The Minister said he was greatly 
encouraged by the negotiating framework that had been agreed. 
 He complimented Tim Grosser, NZ\'s Ambassador to the WTO and 
Chair of the Agriculture Negotiating Group for the leadership 
he had exercised.  Sutton also expressed his admiration for 
Ambassador Zoellick\'s contribution to moving the framework 
forward.  Senator Shelby said he was delighted to see a 
framework that would allow the Doha Round to proceed.  He and 
Rep. Cramer expressed their strong support for continued 
trade liberalization, though both noted how hard it was to 
convince some industries that they could compete globally. 
 
10.  (SBU)  Comment:  The visit left the CODEL\'s 
interlocutors with a clearer understanding of the role of the 
Congress in American politics and of the hurdles NZ might 
face in trying to get a free trade agreement, a very helpful 
outcome from the Embassy\'s perspective.

Iran\'s Foreign Minister Seeks \"A Fair Hearing\" 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
1. (U) Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi visited New 
Zealand August 23-24 to explain Iran\'s position in the IAEA. 
Kharrazi met with Prime Minister Helen Clark, Foreign 
Minister Phil Goff, Disarmament Minister Marian Hobbs, 
Communications Minister Paul Swain and Agriculture and Trade 
Minister Jim Sutton.  FM Kharrazi said he decided to visit 
New Zealand because Iran knew it could count on receiving a 
\"fair hearing\" from the Kiwis the lead up to the upcoming 
Board of Governors (BOG) meeting later in September.  NZ 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) Deputy Secretary 
(Under Secretary-equivalent) Rosemary Banks provided select 
embassy reps a debrief on the Kharrazi visit.  Banks noted 
that in addition to discussions on the IAEA (below), the two 
sides also held talks on human rights and increased political 
and economic cooperation through a revamped Joint Ministerial 
Consultative process. 
 
Kharrazi: \"Don\'t Isolate Us\" 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Banks prefaced her comments by noting that New 
Zealand believed it had influence with Iran as it was \"not 
identified with any particular side,\" adding that the GNZ 
would be guided by IAEA reports on Iran and \"consensus\" views 
within the IAEA.  Banks said Kharrazi repeatedly urged that 
Iran not be isolated if the international community wanted to 
achieve its goals with Tehran.  At the same time, Kharrazi 
was also insistent that Iran had a right to develop a nuclear 
power program that included a fully developed nuclear fuel 
cycle.  Development of a nuclear program was now a matter of 
\"national pride\" for Iran, according to Kharrazi, especially 
within the new Majlis.  He further stated that the Majlis was 
pushing the Iranian government to move more quickly on 
establishing a full nuclear program.  Kharazzi insisted that 
the suspension of the enrichment program had always been 
meant to be temporary. 
 
3.  (C) An \"upbeat\" Iranian delegation told the GNZ that it 
felt Iran had provided \"satisfactory\" answers to all 
outstanding questions and no longer expected to be 
\"automatically\" placed on future IAEA BOG agendas.  The 
delegation said the current \"file\" on Iran should be 
\"permanently closed\" after the September IAEA meeting. 
During its meetings with Hobbs and elsewhere, the Iranian 
delegation had ticked off its list of answers to outstanding 
questions.  For instance, on shielding, the Iranians said 
this was simply due to an \"old French design.\"  On fuel 
supplies, Iran said Russia had agreed to supply and take back 
expended fuel, but there had been no agreement on price as 
yet.  On polonium, contamination had occurred before Iran 
acquired the technology.  On laser enrichment, the delegation 
admitted that Iran had tried various technologies during the 
period it was under sanctions. 
 
GNZ:  Iran Must Abandon Enrichment and Refining Activities 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
4.  (C) A senior official of Prime Minister Helen Clark\'s 
office informed DCM that the PM had firmly told Kharrazi in 
their private session that NZ expected Iran to abandon its 
enrichment and refining activities.  PM Clark publicly stated 
that it was \"absolutely critical\" that Iran comply with IAEA 
requests and expressed concern at the length of time it was 
taking to find out what Iran was \"actually doing.\"  Minister 
Hobbs bluntly told the Iranians in private that the IAEA 
reports painted a picture of a possible nuclear weapons 
program.  The GNZ told the Iranian delegation that Iran\'s 
\"IAEA file\" would only be closed if Iran\'s outstanding 
questions were fully resolved to the satisfaction of the IAEA 
BOG.

     D. 2003 WELLINGTON 1213 
 
Classified by Acting DCM Timothy Zuniga-Brown.  Reason: 1.5 
(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Taiwan\'s economic affairs minister withdrew 
his application for a visa to attend a business conference in 
Wellington after the New Zealand government made it clear 
that it would not approve his visit.  Although the minister, 
Lin Yi-fu, had traveled to Wellington two years ago to attend 
the conference, the New Zealand government said that 
circumstances had changed and that it did not want to 
antagonize the People\'s Republic of China nor jeopardize its 
negotiations for a free-trade agreement with Beijing.  In the 
absence of a free-trade deal with the United States, New 
Zealand is anxious to secure an agreement with China and is 
aiming to start talks early next year.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Minister Lin Yi-fu had expected to lead a Taiwanese 
delegation to the 17th New Zealand-Taiwan Business Council 
conference, scheduled to be held September 6-7 in Wellington. 
 The conference was canceled August 30 after an official from 
the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) 
told the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Auckland that 
a person of lower rank would more likely be issued a visa. 
Lin then withdrew his visa request. 
 
3. (U) Explaining the government\'s decision, MFAT Deputy 
Secretary Michael Green told the Dominion Post: \"Two years 
 
SIPDIS 
ago, we didn\'t have the level of tension between the Chinese 
and the Taiwanese that we\'ve had for about the last year ... 
and secondly, we didn\'t have a major government priority the 
carrying forward of this trade negotiation with the Chinese.\" 
 On May 28, New Zealand and China signed a trade and economic 
cooperation framework for a  free-trade agreement (FTA). 
Both governments are working on a joint study on the costs 
and benefits of an agreement, which they expect to complete 
before the APEC meeting in November in Santiago. 
Negotiations then could begin in early 2005. 
 
4. (U) Green pointed to China\'s displeasure over Singapore 
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\'s visit to Taiwan as 
suggesting the strain that a Lin visit would place on New 
Zealand-Chinese relations. 
 
4. (U) A joint meeting of the Australian and Taiwanese 
business councils also was canceled over the same issue. 
 
5. (C/NO FORN) Several New Zealand officials have told the 
Embassy that their government considers a deal with China as 
a lever for securing an FTA with the United States (ref A and 
C).  New Zealand also sees itself as in a race with 
Australia.  An MFAT official said this week that the 
government\'s major fear is that, after being left out of the 
U.S.-Australia FTA, Australia -- but not New Zealand -- will 
reach an agreement with China.  He described the New Zealand 
government\'s desire for a Chinese agreement as \"obsessive.\" 
 
6. (U) The business conference was canceled two days before a 
conference in Auckland on doing business in China, sponsored 
by the Auckland Chamber of Commerce and Asia 2000, a 
nonprofit organization partly financed by the government. 
China is New Zealand\'s fourth-largest trading partner and 
Taiwan, its eighth.

Security Assessment 
------------------- 
 
4.  The Cook Islands is a Parliamentary democracy in free 
association with New Zealand, on which they rely for defense 
and assistance in meeting low-level security threats.  The 
Embassy is not aware of any specific threats to U.S. 
facilities or personnel at this time in the Cook Islands. 
However, in light of the worldwide security alert all 
visitors should heighten their security awareness and report 
any unusual incidents to the Regional Security Office at the 
Embassy in Wellington, New Zealand. 
 
5.  Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in 
the U.S. and the November 2002 terrorist bombing in Bali, 
there has been concern that terrorists might seek to take 
advantage of the low level of security maintained in small 
island states such as the Cook Islands in order to target 
tourists in previously safe destinations.  New Zealand has 
worked with the Cook Islands to improve airport security in 
response to this possibility.  Terrorist actions may 
include, but are not limited to, suicide operations, 
bombings, or kidnapping.  Possible threats include 
conventional weapons such as explosive devices or non- 
conventional weapons, including chemical or biological 
agents.  Terrorists do not distinguish between official and 
civilian targets.  Targets may include facilities where 
Americans and other foreigners congregate or visit, such as 
residential areas, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, 
schools, hotels, outdoor recreation events, resorts, and 
beaches.  U.S. citizens should increase their security 
awareness at such locations, avoid them, or switch to other 
locations where Americans in large numbers generally do not 
congregate. 
 
6.  The Cook Islands offshore finance industry has come 
under scrutiny regarding possible money laundering.  The 
Cook Islands has been included on the OECD\'s list of non- 
cooperating states in the fight against money laundering. 
 
7.  As a result of recent military action in Iraq, there is 
a potential for retaliatory actions to be taken against U.S. 
citizens and interest throughout the world.  Public 
demonstrations carry the potential for precipitating 
violence directed at American citizens. 
 
8.  U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a 
heightened state of alert and some have drawn down their 
dependents and/or personnel.  These facilities may 
temporarily close or suspend public services from time to 
time for security reasons.  In those instances, U.S. 
embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide 
emergency services to American citizens.  Monitor the local 
news and maintain contact with the nearest American Embassy 
or U.S. Consulate. 
 
9.  Crime:  Appropriate common sense precautions should be 
taken, especially at night, to avoid becoming a target of 
opportunity. 
 
10.  Weather:  Severe cyclones present a threat during the 
hurricane season, which is from November to March.

E.O. 12356: N/A 
TAGS: AORC, PHUM, PREL, NZ 
SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND TO TABLE AMENDMENTS TO DRAFT 
DECLARATION ON RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.   The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
on August 31 unveiled changes to the draft declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples that it intends to propose 
to the UN Working Group in Geneva. The Ministry, which will 
table the amended text the week of September 13, said it 
aimed to keep the changes to a minimum, in an effort to 
allow for successful implementation by all member states. 
Its key concerns included ensuring that the text was 
consistent with human rights laws, that it addressed 
potential conflicts between individual and collective human 
rights, and that third-party rights were fully protected. 
 
2.   The Ministry says that the aforementioned views are 
widely held by other member nations.  Ministry officials 
anticipate strong support for their proposed changes and say 
that they should not come as a surprise to the U.S. 
Government. 
 
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS 
------------------- 
 
3.        The proposed text amendments were developed in 
consultation with the Norwegian Government.  They will be 
tabled at the UN Working Group as a joint initiative by New 
Zealand, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and 
Switzerland. 
 
4.        In Article 3, which addresses issues of self- 
determination and lands and resources, the Ministry has 
proposed several amendments to ensure the safeguarding of 
territorial integrity and unity of the state. Included is 
the proposed addition, to Article 3, of two paragraphs from 
the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Program of Action. 
 
5.        Articles 25 and 26 address indigenous issues in 
relation to land and resources.  The Ministry has proposed 
minor amendments, and deletion, to various text. Despite 
this, the Ministry maintains that deletion of some text does 
not lessen the importance of these articles but conversely 
underlines the fact that, in regards to human rights and 
land and resources, \"one size does not fit all.\" 
 
6.        Other proposed amendments involve minor language 
changes and, of note, involve articles to do with policy- 
making. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
------------------ 
 
7.        The Ministry\'s proposed changes to the draft 
declaration will be formally tabled at the next UN Working 
Group session to be held in Geneva the week beginning 
September 13. 
 
8.        It is hoped that at this meeting the Director of 
the UN Working Group will accept the amendments in order for 
the declaration to be officially adopted and changed into UN 
language for implementation.  It is also hoped that those 
countries that have been blocking progress on the proposed 
amendments will show their support. 
 
9.        The final Working Group meeting for the year will 
be held in late November or early December. 
 
10.  The amendments were discussed in a briefing to invited 
representatives of the Australian, Canadian and U.S. 
missions in Wellington. 
 
 
 
 
OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
11.  The issue of human rights of indigenous peoples has 
particular relevance to New Zealand because of the 
indigenous Maori, who compose about 15 percent of the New 
Zealand population. The proposed amendments to the draft 
declaration that New Zealand will table mark the culmination 
of 10 years of consultation, debate and negotiation. The New 
Zealand Government hopes that unanimous support of its 
amendments will bring this text to closure and achieve the 
changes that are necessary to ensure that individual 
countries live up to their laws regarding indigenous peoples 
and for states to formally adopt the declaration. 
 
12.  The proposed amended text with explanatory notes will 
be faxed to EAP/ANP and IO/UNP.

CONVENTION 
 
REF: STATE 193533 
 
1.  Seeking New Zealand\'s support for U.S. positions on a 
UNESCO convention on cultural diversity, post on September 
10 delivered the reftel demarche to Jane Kominik of the 
Ministry of Culture and Heritage and to Charlotte Frater of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade\'s United Nations 
and Commonwealth Division. 
 
2. Kominik, who will lead New Zealand\'s delegation to the 
UNESCO intergovernmental meeting September 20-25 in Paris, 
reported September 13 that her government agrees with the 
basic premise of the draft convention produced by UNESCO. 
She emphasized, nonetheless, that her government has a 
number of concerns about the convention in its current form, 
in particular its potential impact on New Zealand\'s existing 
obligations under trade agreements and other international 
treaties.  Kominik said Option B of Article 19 would be the 
only version that her government could entertain, because it 
might allow New Zealand both to comply with the convention 
and to meet its trade, human rights, intellectual property 
rights and other international treaty obligations. 
Otherwise, New Zealand could not comply with the convention 
as currently drafted. 
 
3. Kominik noted that her government also found the draft\'s 
definitions to be extraordinarily broad and imprecise, in 
view of the document\'s being legally binding.  The 
bureaucracy envisioned by the convention should be 
streamlined, including the elimination of a Cultural 
Diversity Observatory (whose proposed functions are 
performed by the Secretariat). 
 
4. She said that New Zealand\'s Minister of Culture is keen 
to promote cultural diversity and that the delegation would 
attend the intergovernmental meeting in a constructive mood. 
It would aim to work through the text to make it one that 
the delegation could accept. 
 
5. Besides Kominik, the New Zealand delegation\'s other 
members will be Shannon Ward, legal adviser in the Ministry 
of Foreign and Affairs and Trade\'s Legal Division, and New 
Zealand\'s permanent representative to UNESCO, Linda Te Puni, 
when she is available.

1.  Embassy welcomes and grants country clearance to U.S. 
Geological Survey Research Geologist Romeo Flores to travel 
to Christchurch, New Zealand from October 1-15, 2004.  The 
purpose of this visit is to lecture at a seminar on coal bed 
natural gas and coal geology as the Erskine Fellow of the 
University of Canterbury. 
 
2.  Embassy understands no assistance is required. 
 
3.  Embassy point of contact is Political Officer Dorothy 
Rogers.  Contact details are as follows: 
Office:  644-462-6043 
Fax:     644-472-3537 
Cell:    027-451-2538 
E-mail:  RogersD@state.gov 
 
4.  Visitors should use local taxi service, which is 
generally safe, reliable and frequent.  Taxi fare from the 
airport to downtown Christchurch hotels is approximately 
NZD35. 
 
5.  Travelers can exchange currency at the airport upon 
arrival and ATM machines are readily available throughout 
New Zealand. 
 
6.  Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZ$200 (US $150).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be administered 
immediately and without warnings. 
 
7.  Security Assessment: 
 
a.  There are no local terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the regional security office. 
 
b.  Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat mail 
have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions in New 
Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, various 
groups in New Zealand have demonstrated occasionally at the 
embassy in Wellington and at the consulate in Auckland. 
These demonstrations were of a small scale and were 
peacefully conducted.  During these demonstrations, the host 
country police and protective services provided adequate 
protection to the embassy and consulate. 
 
c.  While New Zealand is considered a low threat crime 
environment, Wellington and Auckland have experienced an 
increase in violent and petty crimes.  Home invasion 
robberies and assaults, once very rare, are becoming more 
frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur countrywide. 
Visitors should be aware that street crime is a daily 
occurrence in the larger cities, including Wellington and 
Auckland.  Common sense precautions should be taken, 
especially at night, to avoid becoming a target of 
opportunity. 
 
d.  All forms of public transportation are generally safe at

TAGS: EAIR, AORC, NZ, ICAO 
SUBJECT: CIVAIR: NEW ZEALAND\'S VIEWS ON KEY U.S. ISSUES AT 
ICAO ASSEMBLY 
 
REF: STATE 168352 
 
1. Post on August 5 delivered reftel demarche to Nigel 
Mouat, principal adviser, access and services, New Zealand 
Ministry of Transport.  The demarche outlined U.S. positions 
on a number of issues to be considered at the ICAO General 
Assembly in Montreal, September 28 to October 8.  On 
September 16, the New Zealand government provided the 
following response to each issue: 
 
Begin text. 
 
Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program (USOAP) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2. New Zealand strongly supports the ICAO Secretariat\'s 
concept for implementation of a comprehensive system 
approach for ICAO Universal Safety Oversight Audits and 
increased transparency and disclosure of information. 
Accordingly, we also believe that the following additional 
points should be included in the proposed Assembly 
resolution on this subject: 
 
a) Contracting States should receive the full final audit 
report in lieu of a summary report. 
 
b) All aspects of the audit process must be available in the 
audit report provided to States. 
c) The audits and follow-ups relating to Annexes 1, 6 and 8 
must continue to be the core of the USOAP. 
 
d) The audit frequency cycle, including follow-up 
activities, should be as short as possible. 
 
e) The audit must validate claims that ICAO standards have 
been implemented or corrective actions accomplished. 
 
Regional Safety Oversight Organizations 
--------------------------------------- 
3. New Zealand endorses and supports the partnership concept 
as the underlying foundation of ICAO\'s proposed unified 
strategy to resolve safety-related deficiencies and the 
regional (or sub-regional) safety oversight organization. 
However, it must be emphasized that membership of a 
cooperative oversight organization does not absolve a State 
from fulfilling its obligations under the Convention.  In 
other words, States must still take responsibility for 
implementing (or ignoring) safety advice from a regional 
oversight organization. 
 
Environment - Emissions Charges 
------------------------------- 
4. New Zealand supports work by ICAO to address greenhouse 
gas emissions from aviation, including further work on 
emissions charges and international aviation.  New Zealand, 
however, does not wish to be limited from taking measures to 
address its own emissions from domestic aviation, including 
the use of a domestic emissions charge that affects aviation 
fuel. 
 
Flight Information Regions (FIRs) 
--------------------------------- 
5. We have sympathy with some of the thrust of the U.S. 
proposal but cannot support it totally as drafted.  We agree 
in principle that there should not be proliferation of FIRs, 
and we understand the misguided economic rationale behind 
some States\' desires to have an FIR, simply as a source of 
revenue.  In the Pacific Islands Forum, we supported the 
concept that the Air Traffic Services providers should 
recompense States within the FIR for the services they 
contribute (navigation aids, alternate aerodromes) to the 
facilitation of flights and overflights, on a cost-related 
basis, and if this approach was widespread we think it would 
soften the motivation to create new FIRs. 
 
6. The concept of sovereignty seems to be well understood 
over continents, with airspace boundaries generally 
conforming to national boundaries.  But there is nothing to 
prevent one State from delegating ATS provision to another 
for efficiency reasons. 
 
7. However, Article 1 of the Convention is important. 
Particularly this gives a State without a national FIR (such 
as in the Pacific) the right to determine the ATS provider 
over its territory.  The example we are familiar with was 
the request by Samoa and Tonga to realign the boundary 
between the Fiji and New Zealand Oceanic FIRs to allow New 
Zealand to provide the ATS service rather than Fiji.  The 
alternative would have been the creation of two more 
national FIRs inside the Fiji FIR, with attendant 
operational complications.  The Council in 2001 accepted 
their right to choose and adjusted the boundary as the most 
efficient means of achieving the objective of ATS provision 
by New Zealand over Samoa and Tonga. 
 
End text. 
 
Note 
---- 
8. The New Zealand delegation to the ICAO Assembly will be 
led by Glen-Marie Burns, caretaker manager safety and 
security, New Zealand Ministry of Transport.  She will be 
accompanied by Peter Davey, manager policy and 
international, Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand, and 
(Ms.) Leslie MacIntosh, chief legal counsel, Civil Aviation 
Authority of New Zealand. 
 
9. An invitation to the September 28 luncheon was sent to 
Ms. Burns, per reftel, and she has accepted.  Her acceptance 
has been conveyed to U.S. Mission ICAO.

REASON 1.5 (B, D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: New Zealand\'s 12-month military deployment to 
Iraq ended September 25, with the homecoming of over 60 
engineers and support staff.  Prime Minister Helen Clark 
welcomed the troops, and issued a public statement confirming 
that no further deployments to Iraq are being considered. 
While ruling out military assistance, Clark did, however, 
indicate a willingness to provide additional aid funds, and 
to look favorably on a request from the UN for one or two 
military officers to serve in UN headquarters in Baghdad. 
Post continues to encourage the GoNZ to remain engaged in 
Iraq, but political and resource constraints virtually ensure 
Clark will not go beyond what she has already indicated.  End 
Summary. 
 
NZ Troops Return Home 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) New Zealand\'s 61-person Light Engineer Group was 
welcomed home September 25 by New Zealand Prime Minister 
Helen Clark and Defense Minister Mark Burton, ending NZ\'s 
military presence in Iraq.  The engineers, second 6-month 
deployment in Basra, Iraq had been hampered in recent weeks 
by deteriorating security conditions, but Clark stressed that 
the engineers had not simply waited out their time, but had 
remained in the hopes of completing more of their planned 
work. 
 
No Troops, But Financial Aid Possible 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) In media interviews Clark has made clear that the GoNZ 
is not considering sending either military or civilian aid 
personnel to Iraq, noting that the situation is \"too 
difficult and too dangerous.\"  While ruling out military 
assistance, Clark has, however, stated publicly a willingness 
to provide additional aid funds, and to look favorably on a 
request from the UN for one or two military officers to serve 
in UN headquarters in Baghdad.  (Comment:  A senior MOD 
source told DCM that the New Zealand UN Mission had been 
instructed to work with the UN to ensure that an 
\"appropriate\" invitation would be issued once the UN was 
ready to return to Iraq.  End Comment.) In an interview with 
NZ media September 26, Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi 
emphasized that a secure Iraq would serve as a defense for 
New Zealand.  He listed a number of areas where the GoNZ 
could assist, including the provision of troops to protect UN 
agencies, technical assistance or participation in the 
multinational force. 
 
4. (C) Comment:  Clark\'s insistence that further GoNZ 
assistance would be either solely financial, or at the behest 
of the UN is in keeping in tone with earlier comments.  She 
has always studiously refrained from linking NZ\'s presence in 
Iraq to the US and the Coalition, and consistently argued 
that her government\'s decision to deploy to Iraq was taken in 
order to support NZ\'s commitments to the UN and the 
multilateral system.  Despite this, Post continues to 
emphasize that, under UN auspices or not, the GoNZ needs to 
remain engaged in Iraq in some capacity.  While Clark was 
adamant that the troops were returning based on a 
pre-determined schedule (and indeed, they are in need of a 
rest after a their grueling six-month deployment), domestic 
pressures have likely played a role.  Much of the North 
Island was damaged by severe storms and flooding in the first 
half of 2004.  Infrastructure repairs have been hampered by a 
shortage of civil engineers, and the returning troops will 
fill this critical gap.

\"INTRODUCTION FROM THE SEA\" PROPOSAL FOR COP13 
 
REF: STATE 195377 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC COUNSELOR KATHERINE B. HADDA, 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
 1. (C) Summary: The GoNZ is unlikely to support the U.S. 
draft resolution that aims to clarify the term \"Introduction 
from the Sea.\"  New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade (MFAT) interlocutors expressed skepticism that the 
draft submission as written will address illegal, unregulated 
and unreported (IUU) fishing.  They are also not sure that 
CITES is an appropriate forum for a discussion of flag state 
responsibilities.  Despite these reservations, the GoNZ would 
likely support the U.S. proposal if it appeared that a 
majority of other member states agreed.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Post delivered reftel demarche to the Environment 
Division of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade (MFAT.)  MFAT discussed the U.S. proposal at a 
September 27 roundtable that included representatives from 
the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Fish.  On 
September 28, Poloff discussed the roundtable\'s views with 
Emma Kerslake, an Australian Department of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade official seconded to MFAT\'s Environment Division, 
(NB: Kerslake did not attend the roundtable, but was given a 
read-out to convey to us.) 
 
3. (C) Kerslake noted that the roundtable participants were 
unclear on the motivation behind the U.S. proposed draft 
resolution, and asked what specifically the U.S. hopes to 
achieve by its passage.  Kerslake noted that if the desired 
result was truly a desire to achieve better scientific data 
collection, there were more effective mechanisms.  Poloff 
responded that the resolution would assist in addressing IUU. 
 While agreeing that IUU is a serious concern for NZ, 
Kerslake was skeptical that this proposal would enhance the 
accuracy of CITES trade data and specimen tracking, believing 
that a broader catch documentation scheme would be more 
effective.  Kerslake then noted that the proposed resolution 
would have no impact on the NZ fishing industry, as they do 
not have any need for IFS certificates ) neither harvesting 
endangered species nor allowing foreign flagged vessels to 
use NZ as a port of first landing for Article II species. 
 
Specific Questions 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) Kerslake highlighted the following specific areas of 
concern and questions which she said were raised by GoNZ 
officials at the roundtable: 
 
-- Kerslake said the officials expressed concern over the 
proposal to allow agreements between the Management Authority 
of a State of first landing and a flag State, questioning why 
a flag state would be in a better position to regulate than a 
landing authority.  She acknowledged, however, that it might 
be valuable for a landing authority to be able to request 
information from a landing vessel\'s government. 
 
-- Para. 13:  Is CITES the best forum for a discussion of the 
responsibilities of flag states? 
 
-- Para. 19:  Would the landing authority be empowered under 
the proposal to get this information from the flag state? If 
so, GONZ agrees this would be an advantage in combating IUU. 
 
-- Para. 21:  While applauding the intent, Kerslake noted 
GONZ reservations at the ability of this resolution to impose 
on non-party states a determination by a regional or 
international management organization that a particular 
landing is detrimental. 
 
We can be convinced 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) Kerslake noted that the GoNZ would likely support the 
U.S. proposal if it appeared that a majority of member states 
agreed.  However, should the resolution appear unlikely to be 
passed, she suggested the U.S. consider proposing as a 
separate resolution a definition of \"in the marine 
environment not under the jurisdiction of any State.\" 
Kerslake said the GoNZ would support this. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) As noted, Kerslake is an employee of the Australian 
DFAT, and has previously worked on fisheries issues for 
Australia, although she is not familiar with CITES in 
particular.  She was very forthright during the meeting, and 
admitted that her interpretation might be more direct than 
that intended by New Zealand interlocutors.  It is likely 
that the GoNZ delegation in Bangkok will appear to be more 
conciliatory, and may not couch their concerns in the same 
language.  However, it appears that the GoNZ\'s skepticism 
about the need for and the language in the U.S. resolution is 
genuine.

1. (U) Summary: Assistant Secretary Kelly, accompanied by 
Ambassador Swindells, Ed Rindler (INL) and notetaker, met 
August 8, 2004 with New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff at 
the Pacific Islands Forum in Apia, Samoa.  A/S Kelly and Goff 
discussed the deteriorating relationship between East Timor 
and Indonesia, and the possibility of establishing either a 
UN Commission of Experts or a Truth Commission in East Timor. 
 Kelly thanked Goff for the GoNZ\'s contributions in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, urging NZ to consider alternative means of 
assistance following the withdrawal of NZ military engineers 
from Iraq in September.  Goff noted that the GoNZ had 
recently committed to an additional 12-month participation in 
Afghanistan.  Goff remarked that he was happy with the 
progress being made on the U.S.-Australia Free Trade 
Agreement (FTA,) and that the GoNZ was subduing its lobbying 
efforts for an FTA until after the U.S. election in November. 
 End Summary. 
 
 
East Timor 
---------- 
 
2. (C) Talking on human rights, Goff reiterated the GoNZ\'s 
concern over the deteriorating relationship between East 
Timor and Indonesia.  Kelly noted that the USG also had 
concerns about accountability, pointing to the failure of the 
Ad Hoc Tribunal For East Timor Indonesian military, as 
evidenced by the July decision to acquit four Indonesian 
security guards charged with violence in East Timor in 1999. 
Goff emphasized that the international community must set a 
strong precedent for justice, and hold those who committed 
crimes to account.  He favored the establishment of an 
International Crimes Tribunal for East Timor under UN 
jurisdiction, but recognized that this was an unlikely 
outcome, given limited international support for such 
Tribunals in general.  Barring a Tribunal, Goff outlined the 
Kiwi fallback position - the creation of an East Timor Truth 
Commission, which would \"name and shame\" transgressors.  He 
also discussed the possible creation of a UN Commission of 
Experts (UNCOE.)  Kelly agreed that the UN was far more 
likely to support a Truth Commission than a Tribunal.  He 
added that a UNCOE was a necessary precursor to a Truth 
Commission, and that both the scope and term of the UNCOE 
should be limited.  He offered to work with the GoNZ on any 
of these suggestions, especially following the Indonesian 
election in September.  Goff lamented that the inexperience 
of Yudhoyono\'s political base made decisive action on justice 
in East Timor and autonomy in West Papua and Aceh unlikely. 
 
Iraq and Afghanistan 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C) Kelly thanked Goff for the GoNZ\'s contributions to 
OIF.  He noted that security in the build-up to the UN-led 
election would remain a substantial problem but that there 
was now a clear distinction between imported and home-grown 
fighters, and a growing feeling that Iraq is a sovereign 
nation.  Goff remarked that the 61 New Zealand military 
engineers serving in Iraq would finish their rotation as 
scheduled in late September but the GoNZ was willing to leave 
future options open.  He emphasized that although the GoNZ 
would not leave Iraq in the middle of this critical period, 
for operational reasons there are no immediate replacements 
planned for the engineering contingent.  Kelly urged Goff to 
consider additional means of assistance following the 
withdrawal of NZ military personnel.  Kelly also thanked Goff 
for the NZ-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in 
Bamiyan.  Goff pointed out that the GoNZ had reaffirmed their 
commitment to Afghanistan for a further 12 months.  He then 
noted that voter registration in Afghanistan was going well, 
with almost 8 million people on the electoral rolls.  He 
expressed concern, however, over President Karzai\'s ability 
to control warlords and the drug trade, pointing to the 
increasing trouble in Bamiyan with poppy production. 
 
PNG 
--- 
 
4. (SBU) Goff, in response to Kelly\'s query, noted that the 
Government of Papua New Guinea would need continued pressure 
to conform to the December 31 deadline for the UN Observer 
Mission in Bougainville.  Goff stated that there is no 
suggestion of civil war erupting in the country, but the 
infrastructure there remains inadequate. 
Free Trade Agreement 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) Goff remarked that he was happy with the progress 
being made on the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement (FTA.) 
He noted that NZ Ambassador to the U.S. John Wood was 
confident of wide support in Congress for a U.S.-NZ FTA, but 
that the GoNZ was reducing its lobbying efforts until after 
the U.S. elections.  He welcomed any USG assistance in 
helping with the \"psychological impact of investment 
diversion\" from NZ as a result of the U.S.-Australia FTA. 
Kelly explained to Goff that the loss of fast-track authority 
in the coming year would have a serious impact on all FTAs, 
and that a new Trade Promotion Authority would be needed. 
Goff noted that the GoNZ was pursuing a number of free trade 
channels, including an ASEAN ) Australia/New Zealand FTA 
beginning in November.

1, 2000, meet this requirement.  All other TDY personnel 
must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact 
for this training is Assistant Director for Training at 
(703) 205-2617.  Country clearance will not be granted for 
any traveler with planned TDY in excess of 30 days if this 
information is not stated/certified.  POC for additional 
information is RSO Wellington. 
 
b.  (SBU) The U.S. Mission in New Zealand currently rates 
the threat from transnational and indigenous terrorism as 
low.  There are no terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions 
in New Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, 
various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated 
occasionally at the Embassy in Wellington and at the 
Consulate in Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually 
small and are peacefully conducted.  During these 
demonstrations, the host country police and protective 
services normally provide adequate protection to the 
Embassy and Consulate. 
 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but 
they are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, 
home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine 
to Australia.  The most abused drugs in New Zealand are 
locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market. 
f.  (U) All forms of public transportation are generally 
safe at all times of the day; however, at night visitors 
should use common sense precautions so as to not become a 
target of opportunity. 
g.  (U) The traffic situation in Auckland can be difficult 
with a moderate amount of congestion.  Wellington and 
Christchurch traffic is significantly better; however, 
during rush hour moderate delays can be expected. 
Visitors are advised that traffic drives on the left-hand 
side of the road.  Visitors are advised that traffic 
accidents are common and that it is safe to pull over so 
that police may take an accident report.  However, 
visitors who experience hostility or anti-American 
sentiment should depart the scene immediately and notify 
the RSO. 
 
h.  (U) Precautions should also be taken to not discuss 
sensitive or classified information outside secure 
environments or over unsecured and/or cellular telephones, 
and to securely safeguard classified or sensitive 
information at the Chancery and not at hotels or 
residences. 
 
i.  (U) Visitors should also be aware of the State 
Department\'s Consular Information sheet for New Zealand 
and the most recent Worldwide Caution Public 
Announcements, which are available via the Internet at 
http://travel.state.gov 
 
j.  (U) In essence, visitors to New Zealand must exercise 
appropriate caution and be alert to their surroundings 
with regard to their personal security.  Suspicious 
incidents/activities should be reported to RSO Wellington 
(Telephone (64)(4)462-6000, 24 hours/day).

a) Embassy Wellington\'s Terrorism Finance Coordination 
Officer (TFCO) is: 
 
David R. Burnett 
Deputy Chief of Mission 
Tel: 64-4-462-6101 
e-mail: burnettDR@state.gov 
 
Post\'s deputy TFCO is: 
 
Joy Yamamoto 
Economic Officer 
Tel: 64-4-462-6182 
e-mail: yamamotoJO@state.gov 
 
b) Post\'s DCM -- as its TFCO -- chairs terrorist finance 
meetings.  As a SEP post, Embassy Wellington has found it 
efficient to include both terrorist finance and law 
enforcement issues in both scheduled and informal meetings, 
as necessary.  We had not formally included terrorist 
finance issues in our Visas Viper Committee meetings, but 
are doing so now. 
 
c) Because the New Zealand government has taken a concerted 
approach to fighting terrorist financing, we have focused on 
ensuring that it has the information and training required 
for its efforts.  While we have achieved a good flow of 
information, we have been less successful in identifying 
appropriate training opportunities. 
 
d) Although post also coordinates with Legatt at Embassy 
Canberra as appropriate, we are not involved in regional 
meetings. 
 
e) Post has engaged in limited public information efforts on 
terrorist financing.  These efforts have included 
distributing the State Department e-journal \"The Global War 
on Terrorist Finance\" to Embassy contacts.  The distribution 
list included appropriate officials from the Ministries of 
Justice, Police, Defense and Foreign Affairs.  Interested 
media and academics also received copies. Post would welcome 
further suggestions. 
 
f) Both TFCO and deputy have not received FSI or other 
training on combating terrorist financing. 
 
g) Post would welcome information on opportunities for 
training of New Zealand nationals in fighting terrorist 
financing.

1.  Embassy grants country clearance to Department of 
Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
National Weather Service Official Richard K. Nygard to 
travel to Alofi, Niue, October 25 - 29, 2004.  The purpose 
of travel is to re-establish and install Tsunami Tide 
System.

Security Assessment 
------------------- 
 
4.  Niue is a free association territory of New Zealand, on 
which it relies for defense and assistance in meeting low- 
level security threats.  The Embassy is not aware of any 
specific threats to U.S. facilities or personnel at this 
time in Niue.  Visitors to Niue must exercise appropriate 
caution and be alert to their surroundings with regard to 
their personal security.  Suspicious incidents/activities 
should be reported to RSO Wellington (Telephone (64)(4) 462- 
6000, 24 hours/day). 
 
5.  Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in 
the U.S. and the November 2002 terrorist bombing in Bali, 
there has been concern that terrorists might seek to take 
advantage of the low level of security maintained in small 
island states such as Niue in order to target tourists in 
previously safe destinations.  Terrorist actions may 
include, but are not limited to, suicide operations, 
bombings, or kidnapping.  Possible threats include 
conventional weapons such as explosive devices or non- 
conventional weapons, including chemical or biological 
agents.  Terrorists do not distinguish between official and 
civilian targets.  Targets may include facilities where 
Americans and other foreigners congregate or visit, such as 
residential areas, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, 
schools, hotels, outdoor recreation events, resorts, and 
beaches.  U.S. citizens should increase their security 
awareness at such locations, avoid them, or switch to other 
locations where Americans in large numbers generally do not 
congregate. 
 
6.  As a result of recent military action in Iraq, there is 
a potential for retaliatory actions to be taken against U.S. 
citizens and interest throughout the world.  Public 
demonstrations carry the potential for precipitating 
violence directed at American citizens. 
 
7.  U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a 
heightened state of alert and some have drawn down their 
dependents and/or personnel.  These facilities may 
temporarily close or suspend public services from time to 
time for security reasons.  In those instances, U.S. 
embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide 
emergency services to American citizens.  Monitor the local 
news and maintain contact with the nearest American Embassy 
or U.S. Consulate. 
 
8.  Crime:  Appropriate common sense precautions should be 
taken, especially at night, to avoid becoming a target of 
opportunity. 
 
9.  Weather:  Severe cyclones present a threat during the 
hurricane season, which is from November to March.

Post that New Zealand could not provide additional funding 
for this initiative, as NZAID\'s budget is committed for this 
financial year.  Poole reminded post of New Zealand\'s past 
donations of NZ$1.6 million (US1.1 million) in 2003 to the 
Initiative through the WHO, UNICEF and New Zealand Rotary 
International, and NZ$200,000 (US140,000) in 2004, also to 
New Zealand Rotary International.  She added that the Polio 
Initiative will be considered seriously in future funding 
rounds, as immunization is a key component of NZAID\'s 
development strategy.  However, she also noted that NZAID\'s 
priority focus remains the Pacific, and the entire Africa 
program budget is less than NZ$1 million (US700,000) per 
year.  Poole\'s response has been faxed to EAP/ANP.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND\'S REACTION TO PROPOSED EXECUTIVE ORDER 
ON IRAQ INSURGENCY FINANCE 
 
REF: STATE 194466 
 
Classified by Charge d\'affaires David R. Burnett.  Reason: 
1.4(b) and (d). 
 
1. (S-rel New Zealand) Post on September 14 delivered reftel 
talking points and text of the proposed executive order 
regarding insurgency finance in Iraq to New Zealand\'s 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
 
2. (S-rel New Zealand) On October 14, Taha Mcpherson of the 
Ministry\'s Security Policy Division delivered his 
government\'s response.  He apologized for the delayed reply, 
explaining that it had to be vetted by a number of ministries 
and offices, including the Prime Minister\'s office. 
 
3. (S-rel New Zealand) Following is New Zealand\'s response: 
 
Begin text: 
 
New Zealand deplores the continuing violence in Iraq, 
including attacks on civilians.  New Zealand has the utmost 
sympathy for the victims of the violence and their families 
-- both Iraqi, and those from other countries that are 
helping to stabilize Iraq and provide humanitarian and 
reconstruction support under UN Security Council Resolutions 
1483 and 1546. 
 
We welcome the US intention to share information on 
individuals and entities that it believes pose a significant 
risk of committing acts of violence against either the 
Multinational Force in Iraq, or civilians supporting it. 
This information will be of benefit to the New Zealand 
authorities charged with monitoring international terrorist 
groups. 
 
New Zealand would not envisage taking \"parallel action\" to 
that in the proposed US Executive Order because it sees the 
United Nations Security Council process as providing an 
effective multilateral mechanism for freezing the assets of 
individuals and entities associated with Al Qaida, the 
Taliban or Usama bin Laden. 
 
While New Zealand\'s legislative basis -- the Terrorism 
Suppression Act 2002 (as amended) -- is sufficient to ensure 
full compliance with United Nations Security Council 
Resolutions 1267, 1373 and 1390 it would not enable our going 
further, given that it is not clear that those targeted by 
the proposed new US Executive Order would necessarily fall 
within the definition of those who have committed \"terrorist 
acts\" as defined in our legislation. 
 
End text. 
 
4. (C) Comment: The New Zealand government\'s response is not 
surprising and is consistent with the position it has taken 
since opposing the invasion of Iraq, through its freezing of 
terrorist funds under the UN resolutions, and through its 
participation in Iraq\'s reconstruction: New Zealand has 
insisted that such actions be linked to decisions by the 
United Nations.

2. (SBU) Goff also expressed reservations about transparency

supports engaging with countries that violate human rights, 
versus exclusion.  Goff reaffirmed the GoNZ\'s commitment to

advocating a reduction in redundant resolutions, and by 
remaining actively engaged in negotiating resolution texts. 
 
3. (SBU) MFAT informed Post that they have delivered the 
original of the letter through their Embassy in Washington. 
Text of letter follows: 
 
The Honourable Colin Powell 
Secretary of State 
 
SIPDIS 
Department of State 
WASHINGTON DC 
 
Dear Mr Secretary 
 
Thank you for your letter of 10 August about the rotation 
scheme for membership of the Commission of Human Rights. 
 
New Zealand fully supports the development of a fair and 
workable proposal for a rotational scheme for WEOG membership 
of the CHR along the lines of the one the Dutch and Canadians 
have been trying to take forward.  We are involved in the 
negotiations taking place about reviving the scheme.  In 
terms of New Zealand\'s interests we shall be seeking to 
ensure than any rotational scheme agreed takes into account 
our candidature for the Commission for the 2009-2011 period. 
It is also important to us that any negotiations on a 
rotational scheme be transparent.  We hope that those few 
WEOG countries in Europe continuing to seek longer terms for 
themselves will withdraw their objections to the proposals 
under consideration. 
 
As to the question you raise about criteria for membership of 
the CHR, while we appreciate US concerns that those that 
violate human rights in their own countries should not be 
setting international norms, we see difficulties in a system 
which would classify some countries as being \"appropriate\" 
and others as \"inappropriate\".  Our approach is to engage 
with countries which violate human rights rather than seek to 
exclude them.  Indeed in this regard we support universal 
membership of the Commission. 
 
I can assure you that New Zealand, which currently has 
Observer status on the Commission, will continue to 
demonstrate our concerns about human rights abuses by active 
involvement in negotiations on the texts of resolutions and, 
where appropriate, co-sponsorship of them.  We shall also 
continue to press for reforms in the way the CHR operates, 
for example, by advocating the rationalisation of resolutions 
to avoid unnecessary annual repetition. 
 
Yours sincerely 
 
(signature) 
Hon Phil Goff 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade

(SBU) In response to reftel:  While the New Zealand 
government is very supportive of the Chinese effort to host 
the first ARF Security Policy Conference (ASPC), it still is 
trying to determine who will represent New Zealand at the 
November 4-6 event in Beijing.  The government is 
disappointed with the invitation\'s tardiness, making it more 
difficult to identify its representative, according to 
Bronwyn Evans-Kent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade\'s Security Policy Division.  New Zealand probably will 
send a representative from its embassy in Beijing and, 
possibly, from the ministry.  The ministry official would be 
at the deputy director (deputy assistant secretary- 
equivalent) level.  Ms. Evans-Kent would be interested in 
learning about U.S. participation.  Meanwhile, she will keep 
post updated on her government\'s plans.

1. Summary: A draft decision issued October 18 by the New 
Zealand Commerce Commission put telecommunications companies 
on notice that the agency stood ready to intercede to cut 
the fees charged to complete mobile telephone calls.  Fees 
now charged by the country\'s mobile-phone service providers 
to terminate calls on their network were \"significantly 
above cost\" and should be regulated, the Commerce Commission 
said.  The decision was welcome news to AT&T and other U.S. 
carriers, which had complained of paying ever-increasing 
fees when they pass calls onto New Zealand.  The 
Commission\'s final recommendation, expected in early 2005, 
may or may not be the same as the draft decision.  The 
Communications Minister will ultimately make the final 
decision later in the year.  End summary. 
 
2. The Commission, which began its investigation of mobile 
termination rates in May (ref A), said mobile network 
operators had been able to set unreasonably high rates 
because of limited competition in the market.  Telecom and 
Vodafone charge about US 19 cents (NZ 28 cents) per minute 
to terminate calls to each other\'s mobile networks.  The fee 
they charge overseas carriers has been almost 6 cents higher 
and was expected to increase.  The Commission said a 
reasonable, cost-based charge would be US 11 cents (NZ 16 
cents) per minute. 
 
3. The Commission -- New Zealand\'s anti-monopoly watchdog -- 
predicted that regulated reduction in the rates would likely 
increase competition in the fixed-to-mobile market, which 
would result in lowering of the retail price for fixed-to- 
mobile calls and higher numbers of such calls.  The 
Commission concluded that regulation would produce 
substantial benefits for consumers and businesses. 
 
4. It did not support regulating future high-speed, third- 
generation mobile telephone networks, saying regulation 
probably would increase the risk of delay or of limited 
investment in the new technology.  That technology allows 
transfer of both voice and non-voice data. 
 
5. The Commission stressed that the draft report reflects 
its preliminary view.  It will accept written submissions on 
the report until November 16.  It will hold a conference on 
the mobile termination rate issue in late November and then 
send its final recommendation to the Communications Minister 
in early 2005.  The minister could accept the Commission\'s 
recommendations, reject them or refer them back for further 
consideration. 
 
6. Telecom, the country\'s largest fixed-line phone company 
and second-largest mobile phone service provider after 
Vodafone, contended that the mobile market was already 
highly competitive and did not need regulation.  Bruce 
Parkes, Telecom\'s general manager of government and industry 
relations, said regulation might lead companies to reduce 
their investment in New Zealand.  Vodafone asserted that 
even if rates were regulated, the savings would not 
necessarily be passed to the consumer but would be pocketed 
by Telecom and TelstraClear, a claim that local news reports 
pounced on.  Meanwhile, TelstraClear, which resells 
Vodafone\'s mobile phone services but is developing its own 
mobile phone network, endorsed the Commission\'s draft 
decision. 
 
7. A copy of the Commission\'s 126-page decision can found on 
its website, www.comcom.govt.nz. 
 
8. Comment: We expect the Commerce Commission\'s final 
decision to be consistent with its draft report.  However, 
we must note that the Commission is fully capable of 
reversing course, having done so in its recommendation in 
December against unbundling the local loop -- a turnabout 
from its earlier draft position (ref c).  The Communications 
Minister affirmed that recommendation in May (ref b).

1.  (SBU) Embassy welcomes and grants country clearance to 
NESDIS Official, Mr. Jeffrey Key, to travel to 
Christchurch, New Zealand from October 23-25, and on or 
about November 21, 2004.  The purpose of this visit is to 
transit New Zealand on his way to Antarctica, where he 
will implement a system that will generate polar winds and 
other real-time products from direct broadcast satellite 
data. 
 
2.  (U) Embassy understands that country clearance is the 
only assistance required. 
 
3.  (SBU) Embassy point of contact is Economic Officer Joy 
Yamamoto.  Contact details are as follows: 
 
Office:  644-462-6182 
Fax:     644-472-3537 
Cell:    027-446-4467

4.  (SBU) All TDY visitors to Embassy Wellington are 
required to report to the Regional Security Office for a 
security briefing if they have not completed an approved 
overseas personal security training course. 
 
5.  (U) Visitors should use local taxi service, which is 
generally safe, reliable and frequent.  Taxi fare from the 
airport to downtown Christchurch hotels is approximately 
NZD35.00. 
 
6.  (U) Travelers can exchange currency at the airport 
upon arrival and ATM machines are readily available 
throughout New Zealand.  Check cashing privileges at the 
Embassy are restricted to traveler\'s checks only up to 
USD100.00.  Personal checks will not be accepted. 
 
7.  (SBU) Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The Government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZD200.00 (USD150.00).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be 
administered immediately and without warnings. 
 
8.  (SBU) Security Information: 
 
a.  (SBU) All U.S. citizen personnel serving under the 
Chief of Mission authority in a temporary status of 30 
days or more must complete appropriate overseas personal 
security training prior to travel (04 State 66580). 
Employees who have completed the Security Overseas Seminar 
course at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) after June 
1, 2000, meet this requirement.  All other TDY personnel 
must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact 
for this training is Assistant Director for Training at 
(703) 205-2617.  Country clearance will not be granted for 
any traveler with planned TDY in excess of 30 days if this 
information is not stated/certified.  POC for additional 
information is RSO Wellington. 
 
b.  (SBU) The U.S. Mission in New Zealand currently rates 
the threat from transnational and indigenous terrorism as 
low.  There are no terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions 
in New Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, 
various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated 
occasionally at the Embassy in Wellington and at the 
Consulate in Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually 
small and are peacefully conducted.  During these 
demonstrations, the host country police and protective 
services normally provide adequate protection to the 
Embassy and Consulate. 
 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but 
they are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, 
home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine 
to Australia.  The most abused drugs in New Zealand are 
locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market. 
 
f.  (U) All forms of public transportation are generally 
safe at all times of the day; however, at night visitors 
should use common sense precautions so as to not become a 
target of opportunity. 
 
g.  (U) The traffic situation in Auckland can be difficult 
with a moderate amount of congestion.  Wellington and

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND POLITICAL SCANDAL MAY LOSE THE 
GOVERNMENT ITS PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY 
 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR KATHERINE B. HADDA, FOR REASONS 1.5( 
B,D) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Recent allegations concerning New Zealand 
Labour Government Minister John Tamihere\'s relationship to 
his former place of employment could result in a by-election, 
whose loss would end Labour\'s single-vote Parliamentary 
majority.  This would force the Government to revise its 
political agenda in a pre-election year, in order to attract 
another coalition partner.  Tamihere took leave from his 
Ministerial portfolios October 15 amidst allegations related 
to illegal payments he received from the Waipareira Trust, 
where he was CEO until entering Parliament in 1999. 
Opposition politicians are demanding Tamihere\'s dismissal. 
The Government has instead appointed a Queen\'s Counsel to 
investigate the allegations, a six-week process no doubt born 
of a wish to avoid having a non-Labour candidate take his 
seat.  This may well be postponing the inevitable, however. 
Labour\'s relatively slow response to the allegations, 
probably due to the absence of Prime Minister Clark, has 
compounded the Government\'s woes.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) ACT party leader Rodney Hide, well-known for his 
\"perk-busting\" persona, unveiled allegations October 14 that 
Tamihere accepted a NZ$195,000 \"golden handshake\" from his 
former employer, the Te Whanau o Waipareira Trust in 2000, 
despite a public statement a year earlier that he would not 
accept the payment.  Further allegations claim Tamihere did 
not pay tax on his \"handshake\" funds and also received 
questionable auto insurance and other personal payments by 
the Trust while he was in Parliament.  No one in Government 
has denied that Mr. Tamihere took the initial payment after 
stating that he would not.  However, Tamihere has denied any 
wrong-doing, pointing to investigations into the payment in 
2000 by the Serious Fraud Office, NZ Police, Audit Office, 
Prime Minister\'s Department and a Maori Affairs select 
committee over trust affairs, none of which found evidence of 
wrong-doing.  Both he and the Trust maintain that the 
payments were delayed compensation for work done prior to his 
entry into Parliament, not for his services while in 
Parliament.  Tamihere also maintains that he believed the 
Trust had already paid tax on the sum. 
 
The Players: Waipareira Trust 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Tamihere was CEO of the Waipareira Trust for ten 
years, prior to entering Parliament in 1999.  The Trust was 
established to provide economic, social and employment 
support to the high number of Maori who relocated to West 
Auckland in the 1950s.  Ironically, the audit of the Trust\'s 
finances that uncovered the payment originated with a letter 
from Tamihere to auditing firm Deloitte, accusing the Trust 
of mismanagement and corruption, and demanding 
accountability.  As a result of the letter, Deloitte extended 
the initial audit to cover seven years, which included a 
portion of Tamihere\'s tenure as CEO. 
 
The Players: John Tamihere 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Tamihere enjoys a reputation as a live-wire, and is 
seen as a \"bloke\" in a largely female, intellectual, and 
politically-correct Government.  Prior to entering 
Parliament, he received four DUIs, and has had three speeding 
tickets while in Parliament.  Tamihere is widely regarded as 
being the voice of urban and modern Maori, and his political 
views, which focus on the need for Maori to improve their 
economic status through hard work and not handouts, resonate 
with more right-wing audiences.  He has often been touted as 
a possible first Maori Prime Minister for that reason. 
 
Direct Political Consequence 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Tamihere\'s potential resignation would not just be a 
blow to the Labour Government\'s standing: it could have a 
direct effect on its ability to govern.  Tamihere\'s Tamaki 
Makarau seat is one of seven in Parliament designated 
specifically for Maori.  Public polling puts the newly-formed 
Maori Party, whose candidate is likely to be Party co-leader 
Pita Sharples, within 4 points of Tamihere if a by-election 
were held. The Labour coalition currently governs with a 
one-vote majority: Labour (51 seats), Progressive Coalition 
(2) and United Future (8).  Without Tamihere, Labour would 
need either the Greens (9 votes) or NZ First (13 votes) to 
maintain a majority.  Neither Party\'s quid pro quo for 
confidence votes fits comfortably with Labour\'s agenda. 
 
Opposition Reaction 
------------------- 
 
6. (C) The Opposition National Party, after a long silence 
and disjointed statements, has focused on attacking Labour in 
Parliament - repeatedly questioning the absent Prime 
Minister\'s (Clark is on a trip to India) confidence in 
Tamihere.  Revisiting the race relations issue that shot his 
Party up in the polls, Opposition leader Don Brash has also 
accused Labour of a \"double-standard\" in its treatment of 
allegations against Maori versus non-Maori MPs. Labour MPs 
and staffers, including acting PM Cullen, have responded with 
a nasty offensive - offering theories that Maori Party 
sympathizers in the Trust have worked to undo Tamihere, and 
trying to focus attention on similar National Party scandals 
of past years.  NZ First Party leader Winston Peters, quick 
to attack Tamihere over the scandal, has also been quick to 
assure his constituency that should Labour lose the 
by-election, the Party should still serve the remainder of 
their three-year term.  (Note: Peters has been open in his 
dislike of National, and is likely hoping to resume his 
king-maker persona and throw his party\'s 13 votes behind 
Labour.) 
 
7. (C) Comment: Prime Minister Helen Clark\'s absence may have 
slowed Labour\'s reaction to the scandal, compounding the 
beating the Government has taken in Parliament and the media. 
 Clark has demoted Ministers for lesser offenses, and is 
respected for her ability to achieve Party discipline. 
Tamihere\'s reputation as a rebellious MP makes it likely that 
Clark will at a minimum bump him to the backbenches, rather 
than sustain continued Opposition attacks.  Should Tamihere 
be cleared of the charges, his widespread popularity as a 
Maori leader could see him rehabilitated at the 2005 
election.  Given the mounting allegations against him, 
however, we regard that as unlikely.

SUBJECT: REVISED PATENT LAW WON\'T HELP DRUG INDUSTRY IN 
NEW ZEALAND 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: A proposed revision of New Zealand\'s patent law 
will disappoint pharmaceutical companies by failing to extend the 
effective patent life of drugs -- stuck at seven years on average 
-- and prohibiting patents for methods of medical treatment. 
U.S. pharmaceutical firms especially wanted a longer patent term, 
which would increase the time they could profit from their 
inventions before they faced competition from generics. 
 
2. (SBU) U.S. pharmaceutical firm representatives we spoke with 
suspect the New Zealand government is not extending the patent 
term in order to retain a card to play in possible free-trade 
negotiations with the United States.  But, the decision also is 
consistent with the government\'s efforts to hold down drug 
prices.  Policies supporting that objective already have caused 
some pharmaceutical firms to leave the New Zealand market and 
others to reduce their profile and investments in the country. 
The proposed patent amendment will help sustain that trend.  End 
summary. 
 
Joining the 21st century 
------------------------ 
3. (U) Following Cabinet\'s instructions, the Ministry of Economic 
Development is drafting legislation to revise the Patents Act 
1953.  The ministry hopes to publicly release the draft before 
the end of the year, with the legislation to be introduced in 
Parliament in early 2005, according to a ministry official. 
 
4. (U) The revision is intended to bring New Zealand\'s patent law 
into closer conformity with international standards.  New Zealand 
is one of the few countries that apply a \"local novelty standard\" 
for granting a patent.  As the patent law now stands, an 
invention is considered new and therefore patentable if no 
earlier publication or use had occurred in New Zealand before the 
filing of the patent application.  The revision would make 
patents more difficult to obtain by requiring the invention not 
only to be new -- anywhere in the world -- but also to involve an 
inventive step, the ministry official said.  Taking into account 
technological and social changes since 1953, the amended law 
would place New Zealand in harmony with its major trading 
partners, Australia and the United States, in determining 
patentability.  The result is that overseas investors and 
companies should face fewer barriers to commercial development of 
their inventions.  About 90 percent of New Zealand patents are 
granted to overseas intellectual property owners. 
 
5. (U) A review of the Patents Act was initiated in 1989, but was 
put on hold in 1990 due to the indigenous Maoris\' concerns for 
protecting their cultural heritage, according to the ministry 
official.  The review was reopened in 2000.  The resulting 
proposed revisions would establish a Maori consultative committee 
to advise the patents commissioner on whether an invention 
involves traditional knowledge or indigenous plants and animals 
or is contrary to Maori values.  Patent protection could be 
denied if commercial exploitation would be contrary to morality 
or public order, to protect human or animal or plant, or to avoid 
serious harm to the environment.  These provisions could be 
applied to genetic material, although such material is not 
specifically excluded from patentability.  The ministry official 
said the exclusions would be allowed under Article 27(2) of the 
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights (TRIPS). 
 
No patents for methods of treatment 
----------------------------------- 
6. (U) The proposed amendment also will exclude from 
patentability human beings and methods of treating them. 
Publicly, the government has cited ethical reasons for the 
exclusions, contending that it would be immoral to constrain for 
commercial reasons a doctor\'s ability to use the best available 
methods to treat patients.  Privately, the ministry official told 
us a primary concern was that patents covering medical methods 
could increase public health costs.  He said the government was 
not convinced that the benefits of such patents would outweigh 
their costs. 
 
7. (U) The methods-of-treatment exclusion is the government\'s 
response to court decisions saying that the legislature -- not 
the judiciary -- had to decide whether such methods could be 
patented.  In the most recent case, the New Zealand Court of 
Appeal ruled June 28 against Pfizer by holding that the Patents 
Act 1953 did not cover methods of treating humans.  Such methods 
thus were not patentable, nor could the court find a basis for 
broadening the act\'s scope, as it had been asked to do by 
Pfizer\'s attorneys. 
 
8. (U) Pfizer had filed two patent applications in 1998 for 
methods of treating psychotic disorders using a new compound. 
Turned down by the patents office, the company took the case to 
court.  Pfizer had offered to the Court of Appeal to include a 
disclaimer relinquishing its right to sue doctors, who otherwise 
might face a decision to withhold treatment or risk being sued 
for breach of patent.  The court said the disclaimer was 
inadequate. 
 
9. (U) Pfizer has been joined by other drug companies in 
contending that the exclusion of methods of treatment from patent 
protection could further hinder medical research and development 
in New Zealand.  With less profit incentive to research 
alternative uses of existing drugs, pharmaceutical companies may 
forgo the pursuit of other applications in New Zealand. 
 
No change in patent term 
------------------------ 
10. (U) The revised law also would keep the maximum patent term 
in New Zealand at 20 years, as established by legislation enacted 
in 1994.  That law, which also abolished patent extensions, 
brought New Zealand into line with its TRIPS agreement 
obligations.  However, of all OECD countries, only New Zealand 
and Canada do not provide for patent extensions.  Because the 
time required to review patent applications is included in the 20- 
year term, the pharmaceutical industry contends that the 
effective patent life of drugs in New Zealand is about seven 
years. 
 
11. (U) The industry also points to another provision in New 
Zealand law that shortens the time that a company can benefit 
from exclusive rights to pharmaceutical products.  A December 
2002 amendment to the Patents Act allows generic competitors to 
engage in \"springboarding,\" or to prepare their product for 
market while a proprietary drug is still under patent.  This 
provision has allowed generic products to enter the market on the 
heels of a patent\'s expiration.  No change is expected under the 
revised patents law. 
 
12. (U) The Cabinet decided in December 2002 to include the issue 
of patent term extension for pharmaceuticals in the Patents Act 
review.  However, in mid-2004, Cabinet -- without explanation -- 
dropped the issue from an economic study of the Patents Act.  The 
official from the Ministry of Economic Development told us the 
new patents bill would not address the issue. 
 
13. (SBU) Although officials have declined to comment on why the 
Cabinet nixed a patent extension for pharmaceuticals, some in the 
industry have suspicions.  Representatives from two U.S. 
pharmaceutical companies in August separately told the Consul 
General in Auckland that there was strong speculation, backed by 
their discussions with high-level government staff, that the 
study of pharmaceuticals\' patent life had been sidetracked to 
give New Zealand \"something to trade away\" when, or if, New 
Zealand was asked to enter free-trade negotiations with the 
United States.  As it now stands, New Zealand will not even 
undertake an analysis of the possible benefits of an extended 
patent term for drugs, the drug company representatives 
complained. 
 
14. (U) The pharmaceutical industry group, Researched Medicines 
Industry Association (RMI), asserts that adequate intellectual 
property protection is critically important to nurture researched- 
based industries in New Zealand.  Lesley Clarke, RMI\'s chief 
executive officer, said the length of the patent term is an 
important factor weighed by pharmaceutical multinationals in 
deciding where to invest in research and site their laboratories. 
 
Comment 
------- 
15. (U) Cost control has long been a primary aim of the New 
Zealand government\'s approach to providing health care to its 
citizens.  As a result, New Zealand ranks 20th of the 30 OECD 
countries in terms of per-capita spending on health.  It has 
managed to control medical costs in large part by restricting 
access by its doctors and their patients to newly introduced 
pharmaceuticals and cutting-edge medical treatments.  Access has 
been limited by slowing the inclusion of new and expensive 
pharmaceuticals to a tightly controlled list of approved drugs 
for which the government subsidizes costs.  The net effect to 
drug companies is to hamper their ability to profit from their 
inventions.  The government\'s decisions not to extend patent life 
or allow patents on medical treatment give the industry yet 
another reason to reduce its stake in the country. 
 
16. (SBU) Meanwhile, the government has identified the 
biotechnology industry as a critical component of its plan for 
long-term, sustainable economic growth.  At some point, it seems 
likely that the government will need to resolve the often 
conflicting objectives of its tight-fisted controls on medical 
practice and its encouragement of a biotechnology industry. 
Until that day arrives, the two goals will share an uneasy co- 
existence.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND URGES UN SECURITY COUNCIL REFORM, BUT 
SAFEGUARDS ITS OWN CANDIDACY 
 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR KATHERINE B. HADDA, FOR REASONS 1.5( 
B,D) 
 
 1. (SBU) The Government of New Zealand is strongly in favor 
of UN Security Council reform, but is averse to discussing 
its, proposed changes.  The GoNZ has submitted a discussion 
paper on the topic to the SG\'s High Level Panel on Threats, 
Challenges and Change. 
 
2. (SBU) In his opening speech to the UNGA on September 21, 
Foreign Minister Phil Goff advocated UNSC reform, noting that 
an expanded Security Council and \"reform of outmoded 
electoral groupings is necessary for the Council to be 
representative of the international community as it is 
today.\"  He also alluded to a need to expand the 
representation of Asia, Latin America and Africa, and to note 
the contributions of specific nations (i.e. Japan) to the UN. 
 Poloff followed up with Wen Powles, Deputy Director, United 
Nations and Commonwealth Division, New Zealand Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), who noted that the GoNZ has 
proposed expanded elected membership and changes to permanent 
membership.  Powles was hesitant to provide further details 
until the High Level Panel responds to the GoNZ 
recommendations. 
 
3. (C) In his UNGA speech, Goff specifically mentioned 
support for Japan\'s inclusion as a permanent member on the 
UNSC.  Powles noted that the original draft of the speech had 
included more specific recommendations, but in the interest 
of maintaining New Zealand\'s neutrality, Goff had walked back 
from including these.  Powles explained that NZ was hesitant 
to publicly support specific candidates, fearing backlash 
from other countries.  Powles referenced possible candidate 
countries India, Brazil and Germany, but reiterated that New 
Zealand was not prepared to support candidates, due to a fear 
of being seen as partisan. 
 
4. (C) Comment:  NZ may be advocating an expanded membership 
as a mechanism to constrict the perceived dominance of the 
UNSC by the 5 veto powers.  This is likely not specifically 
aimed at limiting US influence, but is in keeping with NZ\'s 
view of the UN as an egalitarian organization and a desire to 
see more representation of Asia-Pacific countries on the 
Council.  Overall, New Zealand\'s cautious approach to 
announcing proposed reforms may be related to their 
announcement October 1 to WEOG members that they will seek a 
two-year term on the UNSC in 2015-2016.  An early indication 
of support for specific candidate countries could negatively 
impact both NZ\'s candidacy and their overall policy of 
working with as wide a range of UN member countries as 
possible.

FAB MGC -- a night-vision scope to be attached to a sniper 
rifle, for use in police nighttime operations, according to 
Steven Eveleigh of New Zealand Police\'s account reporting 
and finance office.  The rifle and scope are considered 
necessary because of the police\'s decision to form a full-

KN203 FAB MGC, including the image intensifier.  (Owen\'s 
postal address is 15/2 Campbell Street, Artarmon, NSW, 2064, 
Australia.) 
 
3. (SBU) The KN203 FAB MGC, with image intensifier, has 
not/not yet been sent to New Zealand, according to Pam 
Bailey of Owen International.  In fact, Bailey said that the 
image intensifier -- which has been on order since early 
2004 from the manufacturer, ITT of Roanoke, Virginia -- is 
not expected to arrive in Norway until January or February 
2005.  Once Simrad receives the image intensifier, it will 
install it in the KN203 night sight, put it through testing 
and then ship it to Owen, for forwarding to the New Zealand 
Police.  Owen International is aiming for a delivery date of 
March 18, 2005.

Classified By: Principal Officer, Siria Lopez, Reason 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
(U) This cable originated from AmConGen Auckland. 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  Approximately four months after its 
creation, the Maori Party has achieved more success than some 
observers may have initially expected, due largely to anger 
in Maori communities over the GoNZ\'s handling of proposed 
foreshore and seabed legislation.  For now, Labour seems to 
have an unexpected rival for the important Maori vote, which 
controls the outcome of seven Maori-designated Parliamentary 
seats.  Nonetheless, the Maori Party faces many serious 
longer-term challenges, including voter apathy, institutional 
support, funding and a strong Maori tradition of voting for 
Labour.  These challenges must overcome if it is to avoid 
becoming just one more failed Maori party experiment in New 
Zealand.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  Approximately four months after its creation, signs 
are that the Maori Party may not be the insignificant blip 
some observers may have initially expected. (Most 
prominently, Labour MP John Tamihere, a high-profile Maori, 
vented against the Party, accusing it of being nothing more 
than a brand name-- barbs that greatly aggravated Maori Party 
leaders.)  But it is not surprising that the Maori Party\'s 
birth has been greeted with caution or outright skepticism. 
Notwithstanding Maori disaffection, previous attempts at 
establishing Maori-based political parties in New Zealand 
have not been very successful.  The three other Maori-based 
political parties currently officially registered are 
electorally insignificant or barely perceptible.  Maori 
voters, traditionally, prefer to give their support to the 
Labour Party. 
 
MMP ) WHY MAORI VOTES MATTER 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU)  Under New Zealand\'s system of mixed-member 
proportional voting, each voter has two votes ) one for an 
electorate candidate, and one for a party.  In addition, 
Maori can choose to vote either on the general roll, or on 
the Maori electoral roll, which votes on the seven 
constituencies specially designated for Maori.  The Maori 
Party will focus on these Maori electorate seats first. 
However, provided the Party retains Maori Party Co-Chairman 
Tariana Turia,s seat, it will receive additional list (i.e. 
Party) member seats in Parliament in relation to the 
proportion of the vote ) i.e. at current polling of two 
percent, the Maori Party could gain one or two additional 
seats.  Current polling for the 2005 election leaves neither 
major party with a clear majority, meaning that the presence 
of sympathetic coalition partners will be the deciding factor 
for any government.  The Maori Party is likely to vote 
closely with Labour on supply and confidence issues, and 
should the Maori Party win additional Maori seats and gain 
list seats, it will amplify their influence as a possible 
coalition partner. 
 
CURRENT PARTY STANDING 
---------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  What could make this latest attempt at establishing 
a Maori-based party different from past attempts is Maori 
anger over the seabed and foreshore issue (ref C).  At the 
end of April, Labour MP Tariana Turia bolted the party to 
protest the Labour Government\'s perceived reversal on the 
foreshore and seabed legislation.  (Proposed legislation 
grants Maori customary title versus full ownership, and has 
been called by some a modern-day land grab.)  In July Turia 
stood in a by-election as a Maori Party candidate and won, 
giving the new party parliamentary representation (ref A). 
Party membership now reportedly stands at 6000.  Recent polls 
have it enjoying 2 per cent national support (translating 
into 2 non-Maori seats if an election were held this month) 
and five percent support in Auckland where many of New 
Zealand\'s Maori live.  The Party may also have a decent shot 
at another Parliamentary slot if Tamihere, currently enmeshed 
in a financial scandal, is forced into a by-election to 
retain his Parliamentary seat (ref A.)  If so, it is expected 
that his Maori Party opponent, Dr. Pita Sharples, would give 
him a good run for his money. 
 
5.  (C)  If Maori disaffection over the foreshore and seabed 
can be sustained and if Maori are prepared to channel these 
negative feelings into positive support for their own 
political vehicle, then the Party is likely to increase its 
Parliamentary representation in the next general election. 
If the party can find good candidates, many already believe 
it is capable of taking all seven Parliamentary seats 
currently reserved for Maori.  Dr. Sharples, Maori Party 
co-leader, confirmed to Consul General that candidate 
selection is the Party\'s number one priority.  The Party is 
seeking out prominent persons, such as Maori Land Court Judge 
Caron Wickliffe, to offer them the opportunity to run as 
Party candidates (Note:  Judge Wickliffe declined Sharples\' 
offer, however.) 
LONG-TERM PROSPECTS? 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Despite the initial traction the Maori Party has 
gained, there are some very daunting challenges to its 
longer-term viability.  Two obvious problems are funding and 
institutional support.  Maori are a minority population and 
their income levels are lower than those of non-Maori. 
Already an early Maori Party fund-raiser planned for the 
South Island had to be canceled due to lack of response. 
Asked about the South Island, Dr Sharples sighed and told 
Consul General it was \"a mess.\"  The South Island Maori 
electorate, he noted, comprises Wellington with its Maori 
urban middle-class and the entire South Island with its 
non-urban, non-middle-class Maori.  The Party has found it 
difficult to establish branches there because of disparate 
constituencies, spread-out population and the lack of 
organizational discipline among Maori Party members.  (NB: 
The Maori seat boundaries are split to cover the entire 
country.  The South Island is home to only 10 percent of the 
Maori population.) 
 
7.  (U)  Maori political apathy is another significant 
challenge.  Maori feel less stake in the political process 
and have lower levels of political participation than other 
groups. At a political meeting on local elections in Manukau 
City, the city with the largest Maori population in New 
Zealand, Maori Party speakers noted that Manukau has the 
lowest vote turnout for local government elections in the 
country.  Voter turnout among Maori and Pacific Islanders, 
they said, was even lower. 
 
8.  (U)  Ultimately, however, the Maori Party\'s biggest 
challenge may be the Labour Party.  When Maori do vote they 
have traditionally voted for Labour. Maori have long 
identified Labour as the party most sympathetic to their 
concerns.  Notwithstanding Maori feelings of betrayal over 
Labour\'s position on the foreshore and seabed legislation, 
they believe Labour still better represents their overall 
interests than does, for example, the National Party.  Those 
more practical and realistic Maori question the value of 
giving the Maori Party their vote when, as one Maori academic 
put it, \"the Governor General won\'t be asking them to form 
the next government.\" 
 
9.  (C) Dr. Sharples told Consul General that in order to 
address this problem, a Maori Party priority is to register 
those Maori who have never registered to vote before.  He 
explained that most of these are young persons who do not 
have a long history of supporting Labour.  Thus, they should 
be more easily persuaded to vote for the Maori Party. 
Sharples seemed acutely aware of the difficulty in coming up 
against the powerful Labour Party election machine.  He said 
he hopes Tamihere runs without Labour party backing if a 
by-election should come to pass in Tamihere\'s electorate. 
Under these circumstances, Sharples is confident he could 
wrest the seat from Tamihere.  Otherwise, \"John may eat me up 
and spit me out.\"  \"But,\" he added, \"at least he\'ll get a 
battle.\" 
 
10.  (C)  Asked if the Maori Party plans to run candidates in 
non-reserved seats in the 2005 general elections, Sharples 
said yes but these are simply \"ideas at this stage.\"  He 
indicated that the Party wants to focus on registering voters 
for Maori electorates, where it has its best electoral 
prospects.  But the Party would consider running in those 
general constituencies with large Maori populations. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (C)  Comment:  In addition to the challenges to Maori 
Party viability that are noted above, other potential 
pitfalls include pressure from Maori extremist elements (held 
at bay for now according to Sharples) and divisions along 
tribal lines (a greater worry).  Nonetheless, notwithstanding 
some well-justified doubts, the Maori Party has done 
respectably in a very short time.  It has also put Labour on 
notice that it may now have a rival for the Maori vote, a 
vote that is fundamentally important to Labour and one that 
has been long taken for granted.  So the Maori Party appears 
to have gotten off to a good start.  Now it must establish 
its significance and staying power as a rival to Labour for 
the Maori vote.

SUBJECT: CONVICTIONS IN NEW ZEALAND\'S LARGEST PASSPORT 
FRAUD CASE 
 
REF: WELLINGTON 605 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC COUNSELOR KATHERINE B. HADDA, 
FOR REASONS 1.5 (B,D) 
 
 1. (U) In what media reports have called the largest 
passport forgery case of its kind in New Zealand, two 
refugees to New Zealand, Iraqi Fahad Jaber AJEIL (age 29) and 
Kuwaiti Riyad Hamied SULTAN (age 29), were found guilty 
October 21 of conspiring to commit forgery.  The prosecution 
accused the men of producing hundreds of fraudulent passports 
and other falsified travel documents from 17 countries, 
including the United States, Liberia, Australia, Bolivia, 
Colombia, El Salvador and Yemen.  During the case, 
investigators claimed that 50 passports or travel documents 
had already been delivered.  In addition to conspiracy, Ajeil 
was also found guilty on 13 other counts, including 
possession of items capable of forging documents.  Ajeil and 
Sultan will be sentenced in December. 
 
2. (U) A third individual, Kuwaiti Dr. Salam ABU-SHAABAN was 
identified as the ring-leader of the forgery plot, and was 
named in the conspiracy charge in absentia.  Although the NZ 
Police have not spoken with Abu-Shaaban, he contacted NZ 
National Radio by telephone from Kuwait.  In the interview, 
Abu-Shaaban not only denied any involvement in a forgery 
ring, but also denied being Kuwaiti, claiming to be from 
Lebanon.  Evidence of his involvement was found by the NZ 
Police\'s Metro Special Investigation unit, after they were 
able to translate Arabic documents found on the computers of 
Ajeil and Sultan.  Evidence was given in the trial that 
Abu-Shaaban claimed to be the consul for six or seven 
nations, and issued passports for a number of countries, all 
claims that he denies. 
 
3. (SBU) During the case the defense counsel drew parallels 
between the Prime Minister\'s handling of this case and of a 
recent case involving two Israeli citizens deported for 
attempting to falsely procure a New Zealand passport 
(reftel).  The lawyer claimed that Prime Minister Helen Clark 
refused to pressure the Kuwaiti Government for information 
related to Abu-Shaaban due to the multi-million dollar trade 
in sheep with Kuwait, noting that by contrast NZ and Israel 
have minimal trade linkages.  Defense counsel also tried to 
paint the men as altruistic individuals trying to provide 
passports for stateless Bedouins living between Iraq and 
Kuwait, but the prosecution dismissed this claim of charity, 
citing the money taken for production of the passports. 
 
4. (C) NZ law enforcement indicated to Post that they were 
unable to find any ties to terrorist organizations or 
activities by Ajeil, Sultan and Abu-Shaaban.  It is likely 
that the men were involved in these activities solely for 
personal monetary gain.

heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions 
in New Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, 
various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated 
occasionally at the Embassy in Wellington and at the 
Consulate in Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually 
small and are peacefully conducted.  During these 
demonstrations, the host country police and protective 
services normally provide adequate protection to the 
Embassy and Consulate. 
 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but 
they are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, 
home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine 
to Australia.  The most abused drugs in New Zealand are 
locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND AND THAILAND AIM TO CONCLUDE 
FREE-TRADE AGREEMENT 
 
 
Classified by DCM David R. Burnett.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Begin summary: New Zealand and Thailand have begun the 
fourth and possibly final round in negotiations for a 
free-trade agreement, which New Zealand hopes to conclude by 
November 19, before the next APEC summit.  The New Zealand 
government acknowledged that its effort has been hampered by 
the fact that the Thais stand to gain little from an 
agreement.  New Zealand also has had difficulty surpassing 
the achievements of Australian negotiators in their 
free-trade deal with Thailand, which provided for limited 
liberalization for agriculture.  New Zealand\'s experience may 
hold some lessons for Washington as U.S. negotiators work 
toward a free-trade agreement with Bangkok.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) In October 2003 during the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) Leaders meeting in Bangkok, the prime 
ministers of New Zealand and Thailand made a commitment to 
begin free-trade negotiations.  After holding informal 
discussions in March and May, the two governments began an 
ambitious schedule of formal negotiations in June, meeting 
every six weeks in each other\'s capitals.  The fourth round, 
which started November 1, is being held in Bangkok.  New 
Zealand hopes this will be the final round of negotiations, 
with an agreement signed before the November 20-21 APEC 
summit in Santiago. 
 
3. (C) Shortly before leaving for Bangkok, Rachel Fry, New 
Zealand\'s chief negotiator in the talks, told post October 28 
that access to the Thai market for goods -- particularly 
agricultural commodities -- was the principal New Zealand 
issue remaining to be resolved.  In turn, Thailand was 
seeking to gain access to the New Zealand market for 
specialist Thai chefs and traditional Thai masseurs.  While 
the Thais presented that goal as a services issue, Fry said 
New Zealand views it as an immigration matter it proposes to 
be addressed through a side letter. 
 
Obstacles to New Zealand 
------------------------ 
4. (C) Fry said that New Zealand encountered a number of 
challenges in the negotiations.  Among the most important, 
Thailand\'s across-the-board high tariffs made a free-trade 
agreement (FTA) very attractive to New Zealand, while 
Thailand had far less to gain from a deal.  Sixty-five 
percent of Thailand\'s products already can enter the New 
Zealand market duty-free.  Nonetheless, Fry said that the 
Thai government considers FTAs as a way to promote 
competitiveness among its industries.  The Thai prime 
minister also sees himself as a regional leader on trade 
issues and views bilateral trade agreements as a means to 
bolster Thailand\'s stature in such forums as the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  New Zealand expected 
that, under the agreement, a large number of Thai tariffs on 
New Zealand products would be removed on implementation, with 
others phased out over five years. 
 
5. (C) Fry noted that Thailand\'s free-trade pact with 
Australia -- concluded in October 2003 and signed July 5, 
2004 -- had provided a useful template for the Thai-New 
Zealand agreement and had helped enable the two sides to keep 
to the ambitious negotiating schedule set by leaders.  But 
using this template also has set the bar low on what New 
Zealand negotiators can achieve.  Thailand essentially 
expected that an agreement with New Zealand would replicate 
the one it signed with Australia.  New Zealand negotiators 
considered the Australian-Thai agreement as a general model 
but weak on market-access issues, specifically on 
agriculture.  For example, the Australia-Thailand agreement 
provided lengthy timeframes for the phaseout of tariffs on 
beef and dairy products, which are to end in 2020 and 2025, 
respectively.  There also will be delays in Thai tariff 
reductions for other \"sensitive\" products, including honey 
and potatoes.  Fry said that while 10 percent of Australia\'s 
exports to Thailand are composed of such sensitive items, 30 
percent of New Zealand\'s exports fall into that category. 
New Zealand is trying to shorten the tariff phaseout times 
for beef and dairy products in particular, but Fry recognized 
that as a difficult challenge. 
 
6. (C) Thailand\'s desire to shelter its dairy farms poses a 
particular problem for New Zealand, whose largest export 
earner is dairy.  Fry said that, because the Thai government 
had been accused of ramming through the Australian agreement 
without public consultations, it has made a concerted effort 
to consult stakeholders on the New Zealand negotiations.  The 
result was that the relatively small but well-organized Thai 
dairy industry had significant impact on Thailand\'s position 
on dairy access.  Fry posited that U.S. negotiators would 
face similar problems. 
 
7. (C) In the agreements with Australia and New Zealand, 
Thailand rebuffed any provision that would require a change 
in legislation.  Fry expected that Thailand would need to 
change its stance on this issue in its negotiations with the 
United States.  Fry added that Thailand\'s lack of trade 
statistics and deficiencies in its tariff schedule also 
hindered the talks.  New Zealand may have been disadvantaged 
by agreeing with Thailand to use each other\'s import 
statistics, she said.  For example, Thai statistics appear to 
understate imports of New Zealand goods compared to reports 
by New Zealand exporters.  That disparity could harm New 
Zealand, since proposed agricultural safeguards would be 
triggered by the growth in import volumes. 
 
8. (C) Fry said the agreement will include chapters on 
technical barriers to trade and sanitary and phytosanitary 
measures.  New Zealand hopes these provisions will create 
mechanisms through which such issues could be addressed 
through the FTA.  The Thais have asked New Zealand to develop 
certain import health standards for tropical fruit, which do 
not now exist.  A chapter on intellectual property will 
reiterate both countries\' obligations under the Agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and 
include a commitment to cooperate on enforcement. 
 
9. (C) New Zealand had hoped to gain access to Thailand\'s 
hugely restrictive services market, but now expects to pursue 
further negotiation on the issue in three years, according to 
Fry.  New Zealand also hoped to include chapters on 
environmental and labor protections, but the Thais objected. 
Instead, the agreement will include nonbinding, political 
commitments, which Fry said Thai negotiators classify as 
\"hortatory,\" stating that each party will not depart from 
labor and environmental standards to gain a trade advantage. 
 
Negotiating tips 
---------------- 
10. (C) Fry characterized the Thais\' negotiating style as 
\"cautious,\" although some of the members of the Thai team are 
very energetic.  Many of the team members were prior 
participants in the negotiations with Australia, and Fry 
expected they also would play roles in talks with the United 
States.  She identified Ms. Chutima, who took the lead on 
policy issues, as a particularly tough negotiator. 
 
11. (C) Fry also noted that the Thai Agriculture and Commerce 
Ministries do not appear to coordinate their messages well. 
The Ministry of Agriculture in particular has tried to keep a 
tight rein on its issues, leading to mistakes and confusions 
in the Thai government\'s presentations at negotiating 
sessions, especially at the working level.  At times, the 
Agriculture Ministry presented positions that the Commerce 
Ministry appeared to not have closely reviewed.  The Thai 
negotiators then changed their negotiating positions. 
 
12. (U) Two-way goods trade between New Zealand and Thailand 
totaled about NZ $900 million (US $617 million) in 2003, with 
New Zealand\'s exports to Thailand pegged at NZ $329.72 
million (US $222 million) and imports at NZ $572.73 million 
(US $393 million).  Thailand is New Zealand\'s 15th-largest 
trading partner. 
 
13. (U) New Zealand -- which has free-trade partnerships with 
Australia and Singapore -- is currently holding three-way 
talks with Chile and Singapore.  It also is preparing for 
negotiations with China and is considering such talks with 
Egypt, Malaysia and Mexico.  In addition, ASEAN has proposed 
free-trade negotiations with New Zealand and Australia.

The Government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZD200.00 (USD150.00).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be

8.  (SBU) Security Information: 
 
a.  (SBU) All U.S. citizen personnel serving under the 
Chief of Mission authority in a temporary status of 30 
days or more must complete appropriate overseas personal 
security training prior to travel (04 State 66580).

must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact 
for this training is Assistant Director for Training at

must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact

home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine

locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market.

ON REMAINING SECURITY DELIVERABLES 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 228381 
     B. YAMAMOTO-GABOR 10/22/04 E-MAIL (NOTAL) 
     C. SECSTATE 225115 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles J. Swindells, for reasons 
1.4 (b), (d), and (g). 
 
1.  (C) Ambassador Swindells met with Prime Minister Clark on 
November 2.  He asked that New Zealand urge China to support 
inclusion of the remaining APEC security deliverables at the 
upcoming summit.  He stressed that despite China\'s statements 
to the contrary, the deliverables belong in APEC.  Without 
security in the region, there can be no economic growth. The 
Ambassador stressed that New Zealand\'s intervention could 
carry weight with China, given the two countries\' relations. 
 
2.  (C) Prime Minister Clark, after demurring that New 
Zealand has \"no muscle and little voice,\" acknowledged that 
\"in a funny way, China does heed New Zealand because they 
know our opinions are from the heart.\"  Reviewing the Reftel 
A and C points that the Embassy had earlier provided, Clark 
assured the Ambassador that New Zealand agreed with our views 
on the importance of the three deliverables.  She said she 
would ask New Zealand\'s embassy in Beijing to make a general 
call on APEC issues that would emphasize New Zealand\'s belief 
that the three deliverables belong in the APEC summit.  She 
indicated that the presentation would make it clear that the 
message was coming from the top of New Zealand\'s government. 
 
3.  (C) Clark said that even before becoming Prime Minister 
five years ago, she had held the view that APEC had to 
include political/security as well as economic initiatives 
because there can be no economic health in the region without 
security.  She said that APEC has formally emphasized 
economic issues because that is the only way to include 
Taiwan and Hong Kong.  In reality, however, the organization 
has always covered more than economic initiatives, for 
example its emphasis on East Timor in 1999. 
 
4.  (C) The Ambassador said that the United States had 
parallel views.  If an APEC member  cannot control its 
sensitive exports, its entire customs enforcement mechanism 
will be called into question.  Absolutely, Clark agreed. 
Confidence in the trading system is key, especially after 
9/11.  She said New Zealand was therefore \"thrilled\" with the 
recent container security agreement recently announced by NZ 
and U.S. customs authorities. 
 
5.  (C) The Prime Minister said that on her recent trip to 
Singapore, she found that government reeling from Chinese 
criticism over Singapore\'s granting of a visa to Taiwan\'s 
Deputy Prime Minister just before his becoming Prime 
Minister.  She said she believed that the United States is 
the greatest force for reason with Taiwan, and wondered if 
the cross-strait tensions would be an undercurrent at the 
APEC summit.  She also said that China\'s public lashings at 
Taiwan\'s leadership were undoubtedly counterproductive to its 
goal of moving Taiwan away from independence.  She likened it 
to Bin Laden\'s recent video designed to influence the 
American elections, calling his attempt \"grotesque.\" 
 
6.  (C) The Prime Minister said that she had just learned 
that she is to take the stage with Malaysia\'s Prime Minister 
Badawi at an APEC Counter-terrorism discussion.  She remarked 
that she hoped it would be a more calm discussion than the 
panel she had co-chaired with then-PM Mathahir on 
globalisation.  She told the Ambassador that she had publicly 
told Mathahir off during that heated exchange. 
 
6.  (C) Comment: While we wish that the Prime Minister 
herself would make the approach to China, her desire not to 
do so is consistent with what New Zealand officials have told 
us in the past -- that they believe as a small country their 
role is to be a more neutral APEC player. They also do not 
want to annoy China on the eve of beginning FTA negotiations 
with that country in January.  But we believe the NZ 
Embassy\'s approach will be useful in moving China to the 
right side.  As the Ambassador told PM Clark, \"If you say it, 
they will know it is a trend.\"

5.  (SBU) All TDY visitors to Embassy Wellington are 
required to report to the Regional Security Office for a 
security briefing if they have not completed an approved 
overseas personal security training course. 
 
6.  (U) Visitors should use local taxi service, which is 
generally safe, reliable and frequent. 
 
7.  (U) Travelers can exchange currency at the airport 
upon arrival and ATM machines are readily available 
throughout New Zealand.  Check cashing privileges at the 
Embassy are restricted to traveler\'s checks only up to 
USD100.00.  Personal checks will not be accepted. 
 
8.  (SBU) Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The Government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZD200.00 (USD150.00).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be 
administered immediately and without warnings. 
 
9.  (SBU) Security Information: 
 
a.  (SBU) All U.S. citizen personnel serving under the 
Chief of Mission authority in a temporary status of 30 
days or more must complete appropriate overseas personal 
security training prior to travel (04 State 66580). 
Employees who have completed the Security Overseas Seminar 
course at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) after June 
1, 2000, meet this requirement.  All other TDY personnel 
must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact 
for this training is Assistant Director for Training at 
(703) 205-2617.  Country clearance will not be granted for 
any traveler with planned TDY in excess of 30 days if this 
information is not stated/certified.  POC for additional 
information is RSO Wellington. 
 
b.  (SBU) The U.S. Mission in New Zealand currently rates 
the threat from transnational and indigenous terrorism as 
low.  There are no terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions 
in New Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, 
various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated 
occasionally at the Embassy in Wellington and at the 
Consulate in Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually 
small and are peacefully conducted.  During these 
demonstrations, the host country police and protective 
services normally provide adequate protection to the 
Embassy and Consulate. 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but 
they are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, 
home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine 
to Australia.  The most abused drugs in New Zealand are 
locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market. 
 
f.  (U) All forms of public transportation are generally 
safe at all times of the day; however, at night visitors 
should use common sense precautions so as to not become a 
target of opportunity. 
 
g.  (U) The traffic situation in Auckland can be difficult 
with a moderate amount of congestion.  Wellington and 
Christchurch traffic is significantly better; however, 
during rush hour moderate delays can be expected. 
Visitors are advised that traffic drives on the left-hand 
side of the road.  Visitors are advised that traffic 
accidents are common and that it is safe to pull over so 
that police may take an accident report.  However, 
visitors who experience hostility or anti-American 
sentiment should depart the scene immediately and notify 
the RSO. 
 
h.  (U) Precautions should also be taken to not discuss 
sensitive or classified information outside secure 
environments or over unsecured and/or cellular telephones, 
and to securely safeguard classified or sensitive 
information at the Chancery and not at hotels or 
residences. 
 
i.  (U) Visitors should also be aware of the State 
Department\'s Consular Information sheet for New Zealand 
and the most recent Worldwide Caution Public 
Announcements, which are available via the Internet at 
http://travel.state.gov 
 
j.  (U) In essence, visitors to New Zealand must exercise 
appropriate caution and be alert to their surroundings 
with regard to their personal security.  Suspicious 
incidents/activities should be reported to RSO Wellington 
(Telephone (64)(4)462-6000, 24 hours/day).

Summary 
 ------- 
 
1.  (C) Summary: New Zealand\'s governing Labour Party held 
its annual conference, November 12 ) 14 in Auckland. 
Foreign affairs and trade featured prominently, and Clark 
noted that priorities over a Third term would include the 
following: new trade and economic links, especially FTAs or 
arrangements with ASEAN and India; a focus on sustainable 
development, within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol; and 
continued \"peace and security work,\" with an emphasis on the 
Pacific.  Labour left no doubts on its commitment to NZ\'s 
anti-nuclear legislation, while Senior Labour leaders 
reconfirmed the party\'s multi-lateralist and consensus-based 
foreign policy approach.  The conference\'s headline 
initiative, which was leaked to the press a week earlier, was 
the creation of an all-party select committee to do a 
stocktake of New Zealand\'s constitutional arrangements. 
Overall, Helen Clark\'s Labour Party believes it is firmly in 
control of New Zealand and, barring economic downturn or 
scandal, is well-positioned for the 2005 election.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (U) New Zealand\'s governing Labour Party held its annual 
conference, November 12 ) 14 in Auckland.  Clark\'s keynote 
address encouraged an air of celebration, claiming credit for 
New Zealand\'s economic growth, lower unemployment, rising 
education standards, better access to health care, and 
falling crime rates.  Not surprisingly, these mirror exactly 
the five issue areas the Opposition National Party has chosen 
to attack.  But in comparison with an overwhelmingly 
confident 2003 Conference, Labour tempered its highlight of 
achievements over the past year and increasingly positive 
poll ratings with a warning by Prime Minister Helen Clark 
that there is \"no room for complacency.\"  Clark pointedly 
referenced the disarray in the Labour Party Caucus of the 
1980s, noting that New Zealanders are \"looking for stability, 
predictability, and a commitment to the basics.\" 
 
Labour Strongly Reaffirms Anti-Nuclear Stance 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) In contrast to the Conference of 2003, which focused 
primarily on domestic governance issues, foreign affairs and 
trade were central issues at this year\'s gathering.  Clark 
noted that priorities over a Third term would include the 
following: new trade and economic links, especially FTAs or 
arrangements with ASEAN and India; a focus on sustainable 
development, within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol; and 
continued \"peace and security work,\" with an emphasis on the 
Pacific.  Clark also left no room for doubt of her 
anti-nuclear credentials, stating \"let\'s be clear; under a 
Labour-led government, there will be no revisiting of our 
nuclear free status.  It won\'t be gone by lunchtime or any 
other time.\"  All Conference attendees received anti-nuclear 
bumper stickers in their packs, and in discussions with 
delegates, Poloff was repeatedly told that the issue was 
closely related to Kiwi national identity and the U.S. should 
cease pressure on NZ to affect a change. 
 
4. (C) Senior Labour leaders including Foreign Minister Phil 
Goff and Trade Minister Jim Sutton reconfirmed the party\'s 
multi-lateralist and consensus-based foreign policy.  An 
experimental session that featured a policy paper on New 
Zealand\'s foreign policy direction included a mention of the 
importance NZ\'s anti-nuclear policies have played in the 
past.  (Note: A copy of the policy paper has been faxed to 
EAP/ANP.) 
 
1 New Initiative ) Lots of Hints For 3rd Term 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The conference\'s headline initiative, which was leaked 
to the press a week earlier, was the creation of an all-party 
select committee, chaired by United Future leader Peter 
Dunne, to do a stocktake of New Zealand\'s constitutional 
arrangements.  (NB: NZ\'s constitution is currently comprised 
of certain key pieces of legislation, and some include the 
Treaty of Waitangi of 1840, under which Maori agreed to 
British rule in exchange for British citizenship and other 
rights.)  Opposition parties decried the proposal.  The 
National Party called it a pre-election distraction from the 
issues of race relations, raised by National\'s leader Don 
Brash in January, to great public support.  NZ First called 
the idea a \"road to nowhere.\" 
6. (U) In keeping with its mantra of stability and caution, 
no other new initiatives were advanced by Labour over the 
weekend, and Clark\'s speech focused on multi-year programs 
announced over the past 12 months.  These include increasing 
levels of government support for working families (fully 
funded by 2007), an additional week of paid leave for workers 
(by 2007), and a broadening of the superannuation program for 
government employees. 
 
7. (U) Hints for future programs reflected Labour\'s 
pre-election push to broaden their appeal to average, 
working-class voters.  They hinted at policies such as 
building the asset base and savings capacity of average 
Kiwis, providing support for families with children in 
tertiary education, and crafting a non-compulsory 
superannuation program for private sector workers. 
 
\"Many A Slip Twixt the Cup And The Lip\" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Reinforcing Clark\'s cautions on complacency, her 
keynote suffered an unscripted intervention by protesters 
calling for the release of imprisoned asylum-seeker Ahmed 
Zaoui.  The protest highlights Labour\'s vulnerability on 
certain key issues, including human rights and Maori affairs. 
 With a vote coming up this week on controversial 
legislation, which would vest ownership of the foreshore and 
seabed with the GoNZ, Party members repeated thanks to the 
Maori Caucus for its support was duly noted by Maori 
delegates and MPs alike. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (C) Comment: Helen Clark\'s Labour Party believes it is 
firmly in control of New Zealand.  Barring economic downturn 
or scandal, the Party is well-positioned for the 2005 
election.  But Labour knows it must remain squarely 
positioned over NZ\'s political center, or risk a more 
significant challenge from National.  Clark\'s keynote speech 
therefore emphasized Labour\'s delivery of stability and 
economic prosperity, as well as directly addressing issues 
the Opposition had staked out as areas of weakness.  With the 
opposition unable to gain traction from Labour\'s blunders, 
Labour has again proved its strength as a strongly unified 
party, a credit to Clark\'s leadership, especially as recent 
allegations surrounding Maori MP John Tamihere (Reftel) 
threatened to derail Labour\'s Conference.  NZ\'s anti-nuclear 
legislation featured more prominently than in previous years, 
largely a reflection of National\'s release of a discussion 
paper on the issue.  While the message from Labour was clear 
) we will not change- the Party\'s need to mention this may 
indicated that discussion of the issue is gaining traction. 
End comment. 
 
7. (U) The text of Helen Clark\'s speech and the Labour Party 
Draft Working Paper on Foreign Policy can be found at Embassy 
Wellington\'s Classified Website.

1.  (C) On November 12, POL/ECON Couns discussed Reftel B 
resolutions with Val Meyer, Deputy Director of the Human 
Rights Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT).  Meyer was joined by Tamsin Royson, MFAT\'s policy 
officer for Africa. 
 
2.  (C) Meyer said that New Zealand would likely co-sponsor 
resolutions on Iran, Sudan, Burma, and Zimbabwe, as long as 
the wording of the resolutions were not weakened 
unacceptably.  New Zealand would also probably vote in favor 
-- but not co-sponsor -- resolutions against the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DROC), Turkmenistan, and Belarus if 
the wording on these remained meaningful. 
 
3.  (C) Meyer said that New Zealand\'s small delegation in New 
York can only process so much information and therefore has 
to focus on what it or the GONZ knows.  Pol/Econ Counselor 
asked whether it would be helpful for GONZ to receive earlier 
any supporting information on possible resolutions.  Meyer 
said not really, as in general New Zealand will only 
co-sponsor resolutions when it has traditional ties with 
and/or diplomatic representation in the countries involved. 
Otherwise, New Zealand believes it is in no position to add 
anything in negotiations on the wording of such resolutions, 
she said.  The only other times in which New Zealand might 
co-sponsor a resolution is if the problems in the country 
involved were known by -- and of concern to -- the general 
New Zealand public.  This is why New Zealand did not 
co-sponsor the Belarus resolution, for example. Meyer said 
even if it does not co-sponsor, New Zealand will generally 
vote for Human Rights resolutions if the principle sponsors 
do not weaken the language \"to blandness.\" 
 
4.  (C) Pol/Econ Counselor asked whether New Zealand has 
supported human rights resolutions against China.  Meyer said 
she could not recall, but added that New Zealand talks 
regularly with the PRC about Human Rights and does raise 
specific cases with Chinese officials.  GONZ officials make 
similar approaches to Iran, she said.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND ASSESSES VIABILITY OF NEW AIRCRAFT 
ACCESS IN ANTARCTICA; EYE TOWARDS FIGHTING ILLEGAL FISHING 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: National Science Foundation (NSF), 
Raytheon, and Embassy representatives attended a logistics 
planning briefing hosted by the NZ Defence Force (NZDF) 
October 14 to assess the viability of allowing Royal NZ Air 
Force P-3K Orion and Boeing 757 aircraft to use the landing 
areas at McMurdo Station, Antarctica.  The use of ice runways 
at McMurdo Station by NZDF P3Ks would significantly increase 
the surveillance area under the GoNZ\'s Operation Mawsoni, 
which supports the inspection regime of the Commission for 
the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 
(CCAMLR) by locating vessels conducting illegal and 
unregulated fishing (IUU.)  The Boeing 757s would be used to 
offset U.S. C-130 personnel and cargo flights.  While the 
projects present logistic challenges, both are viable, and 
could be underway by the 2006 Antarctic summer season.  As of 
yet, neither project has been officially presented to members 
of the NZ Government.  The reps from NSF and Raytheon (who 
provide logistical services for USG operations in Antarctica) 
agreed at the meeting to look into housing and other 
logistical requirements for the proposed projects. 
Powerpoint presentations have been e-mailed to EAP/ANP and 
OES/OA. End summary. 
 
CCAMLR Surveillance 
------------------- 
 
2. (U) Trevor Hughes, Antarctica Policy Unit, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) outlined the current status 
of Operation MAWSONI, including the policy and legal aspects. 
 Hughes pointed out that even a single P3K flight with 
increased surveillance coverage could significantly deter IUU 
fishing boats.  In concert with MFAT,s Legal Representative, 
Hughes did not foresee any legal problems raised by allowing 
P3K Orion flights into Antarctica.  Hughes noted that under 
Article 1.2 of the Antarctic Treaty, which states that the 
continent can be used \"for scientific research, or any other 
peaceful purpose,\" use of the P3Ks would be allowed, but the 
GoNZ would have to provide prior notification of their use to 
all Antarctic Treaty nations.  He confirmed that the use of 
the aircraft has no military purpose, and is not related to 
NZ\'s territorial claim in Antarctica. 
 
Can A P-3K Orion Land At McMurdo? 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Group Captain Short presented the NZDF\'s initial 
assessment of how operating P3K flights from McMurdo would 
specifically increase surveillance of the CCAMLR area, 
including patrol area scope and increased time on the ice. 
The flights could triple the area of the Ross Sea under 
surveillance, and a 5-day run in and out of McMurdo could 
produce 24 hours of patrol, versus the current 2 hours using 
Christchurch as the return point.  (NB: This would comprise 3 
6-hour patrols and 6 hours to deploy and redeploy.) 
 
4. (SBU)  Short noted that overall, the P3K Orion could 
operate under Antarctic conditions.  The aircraft is suitable 
to temperatures as low as )40 degrees Celsius, and the ice 
runway is long enough to accommodate the P3K\'s 4,600 foot 
take-off length.  Short highlighted potential concerns, 
noting especially that because of the P3K\'s low wing design, 
exhaust efflux could melt the runway during takeoff. 
 
5. (SBU) Short also said that the availability of ice 
survival training may limit available personnel, as only 
10-15 aircrew are trained annually.  However, he appeared 
optimistic that with the creation of standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) for ice flights and the crews, increasing 
familiarity with polar flying and McMurdo\'s facilities, there 
would be a progressive build-up of capabilities. 
 
Timeline

6. (SBU)  Barring hiccups, the NZDF could achieve full PK3 
operations by the 2006 Antarctic Season.  Short noted that 
NZ\'s continued commitment to the Global War on Terror (GWOT) 
decreased available resources, as did planned upgrades to 
military aircraft.  For now, the NZDF is planning to develop 
SOPs for Antarctic missions by July 2005.  This season, they 
will send two maintenance personnel to the Ice for 
familiarization, and to conduct an exhaust efflux trial. 
 
The Boeing 757 
-------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Group Captain Short also presented a summary of the 
requirements for landing Boeing 757 (B757) aircraft on the 
ice runway, which appear to be more problematic, although 
overall policies and procedures would mirror those for the 
C-130 flights.  The largest obstacle is that the planes would 
need a new Navigational fit-out, as they do not possess 
TACAN, have no radar, and no GPS.  There is no \"GRID\" 
navigation system available.  Another concern is that special 
equipment may be needed to load and offload cargo, as the 
hold is 13 ft off the ground.  The airfield was deemed 
suitable, with sufficient length to account for any problems. 
 
 
8. (SBU) The proposed B757 flights would be able to handle 
110 passengers each carrying 76 pounds (approx. 16,000 kgs.) 
Short noted that the point of no return in flying to the Ice 
was 80-110 minutes from McMurdo.  Short then pointed out that 
there were a number of procedures and concerns that had not 
been examined in detail, including maintenance procedures for 
the aircraft, risk analysis for the flights, the feasibility 
of holding spare parts on the Ice, etc.  These would be 
addressed dependent on whether or not the project receives 
approval from the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs 
and Trade, neither of which have been briefed at this time. 
 
Timeline 
-------- 
 
9. (SBU) Short indicated that the NZDF hopes to have draft 
policies by October 2005, and that operations would be 
possible by late 2006.  This program would be an NZDF 
priority decision, but not before 2006. 
 
Issues for the USG to Consider 
------------------------------ 
 
10. (SBU)  During the course of the meeting, issues that 
would need to be addressed by the NSF and other USG agencies 
were raised.  Representatives from NSF and Raytheon offered 
to examine each of these, and to keep their GoNZ counterparts 
apprised of developments.  Concerns included: 
- Housing of crew and maintenance staff. 
- Transport to and from Pegasus. 
- Ground handling support and equipment to access the B757 
cargo hold (at 13 ft. high) 
- Housing and shipping of fuel and other spare parts.

4.  (SBU) All TDY visitors to Embassy Wellington are 
required to report to the Regional Security Office for a 
security briefing if they have not completed an approved 
overseas personal security training course. 
 
5.  (SBU) Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The Government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZD200.00 (USD150.00).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be 
administered immediately and without warnings. 
 
6.  (SBU) Security Information: 
 
a.  (SBU) All U.S. citizen personnel serving under the 
Chief of Mission authority in a temporary status of 30 
days or more must complete appropriate overseas personal 
security training prior to travel (04 State 66580). 
Employees who have completed the Security Overseas Seminar 
course at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) after June 
1, 2000, meet this requirement.  All other TDY personnel 
must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact 
for this training is Assistant Director for Training at 
(703) 205-2617.  Country clearance will not be granted for 
any traveler with planned TDY in excess of 30 days if this 
information is not stated/certified.  POC for additional 
information is RSO Wellington. 
 
b.  (SBU) The U.S. Mission in New Zealand currently rates 
the threat from transnational and indigenous terrorism as 
low.  There are no terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions 
in New Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, 
various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated 
occasionally at the Embassy in Wellington and at the 
Consulate in Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually 
small and are peacefully conducted.  During these 
demonstrations, the host country police and protective 
services normally provide adequate protection to the 
Embassy and Consulate. 
 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but 
they are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, 
home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine 
to Australia.  The most abused drugs in New Zealand are 
locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market. 
 
f.  (U) All forms of public transportation are generally 
safe at all times of the day; however, at night visitors 
should use common sense precautions so as to not become a 
target of opportunity. 
 
g.  (U) The traffic situation in Auckland can be difficult 
with a moderate amount of congestion.  Visitors are 
advised that traffic drives on the left-hand side of the 
road.  Visitors are advised that traffic accidents are 
common and that it is safe to pull over so that police may 
take an accident report.  However, visitors who experience 
hostility or anti-American sentiment should depart the 
scene immediately and notify the RSO. 
 
h.  (U) Precautions should also be taken to not discuss 
sensitive or classified information outside secure 
environments or over unsecured and/or cellular telephones, 
and to securely safeguard classified or sensitive 
information at the Chancery and not at hotels or 
residences. 
 
i.  (U) Visitors should also be aware of the State 
Department\'s Consular Information sheet for New Zealand 
and the most recent Worldwide Caution Public 
Announcements, which are available via the Internet at 
http://travel.state.gov 
 
j.  (U) In essence, visitors to New Zealand must exercise 
appropriate caution and be alert to their surroundings 
with regard to their personal security.  Suspicious 
incidents/activities should be reported to RSO Wellington 
(Telephone (64)(4)462-6000, 24 hours/day).

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: SENV, AORC, EAGR, ETRD, PREL, NZ 
SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO REQUEST ON NEGOTIATIONS 
UNDER GLOBAL AGREEMENT TO PROTECT OZONE LAYER 
 
REF: STATE 245175 
 
1. (SBU) Post provided reftel points to Emma Kerslake, 
Environment Division, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade (MFAT.)  MFAT noted that they would respond 
following consultations with the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Forestry (MAF.)  AgAttache spoke separately with MAF 
Biosecurity officers Peter Johnston and Ken Glassey, who 
pointed out that the MBTOC has recommended a reduction in New 
Zealand\'s 2006 Critical Use Exemption (CUE) request.  New 
Zealand is not likely to press at the meeting for its higher 
requested volume for Methyl Bromide (MB) usage. 
 
Methyl Bromide in New Zealand 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) MAF officials emphasized that the Montreal Protocol\'s 
restrictions on the utilization of MB impact only on 
unofficial uses and do not apply to official control or 
quarantine usage.  In New Zealand approximately 70 percent of 
all MB application is for quarantine control, with most 
applied to forestry exports and produce.  Only about 30 
percent of usage is \"unofficial,\" and would be governed by 
the Montreal Protocol\'s restrictions. 
 
3. (SBU) The most important use of unofficial MB is on 
strawberry fields.  In studying the issue, MAF found that 
some applications, particularly to virgin fields not 
previously producing strawberries, was unnecessary - it was 
being applied as a weed control system versus a pathogen 
control system.  Reduction of this unnecessary application 
should allow the GoNZ to meet the lower 2006 usage level 
being recommended by MBTOC.  However, should those harvested 
strawberries be treated with MB as a quarantine measure prior 
to export, this application would be official, and fall 
outside the purview of the Montreal Protocol. 
 
Concern over \"Official Use\" Impact 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Comment: Largely due to the GoNZ\'s ability to live 
with its lowered target, the U.S. should not count on strong 
support from New Zealand.  On a related front, an Auckland 
study released November 2 found that 4,872 residential 
properties may be located on premises previously used for 
horticulture, and the soil may still contain contaminants. 
While contamination concerns are varied, they include 
chemical applications for both pests and weeds, including 
methyl bromide.  The findings have resulted in increased 
pressure on the GoNZ to test all the named sites and develop 
a national process for identifying and testing potentially 
contaminated sites. Given this controversy, it seems even 
less likely that New Zealand will take a high-profile stand 
on MB limits at the meeting. 
 
5.  (SBU) The GoNZ\'s posture at the Prague meeting November 
22-26 will likely be one of monitoring approaches taken by 
other countries rather than a pro-active stance on the issue. 
 However, the GoNZ may be sympathetic to USG rationale 
concerning technical and economic considerations because of 
their concern that the Montreal Protocol\'s restrictions may 
at some point be extended to official quarantine usage, which 
would particularly effect NZ\'s exports to the EU.  We believe 
New Zealand is therefore unlikely to criticize the U.S. 
position at the meeting, even if it is equally likely not to 
publicly support us.  End Comment.

4.  (SBU) All TDY visitors to Embassy Wellington are 
required to report to the Regional Security Office for a 
security briefing if they have not completed an approved

5.  (SBU) Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The Government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be

serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be 
administered immediately and without warnings. 
 
6.  (SBU) Security Information: 
 
a.  (SBU) All U.S. citizen personnel serving under the 
Chief of Mission authority in a temporary status of 30 
days or more must complete appropriate overseas personal 
security training prior to travel (04 State 66580). 
Employees who have completed the Security Overseas Seminar 
course at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) after June 
1, 2000, meet this requirement.  All other TDY personnel 
must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact 
for this training is Assistant Director for Training at 
(703) 205-2617.  Country clearance will not be granted for 
any traveler with planned TDY in excess of 30 days if this 
information is not stated/certified.  POC for additional 
information is RSO Wellington. 
 
b.  (SBU) The U.S. Mission in New Zealand currently rates 
the threat from transnational and indigenous terrorism as 
low.  There are no terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions 
in New Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, 
various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated 
occasionally at the Embassy in Wellington and at the 
Consulate in Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually 
small and are peacefully conducted.  During these 
demonstrations, the host country police and protective 
services normally provide adequate protection to the 
Embassy and Consulate. 
 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but 
they are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, 
home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine 
to Australia.  The most abused drugs in New Zealand are 
locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market. 
 
f.  (U) All forms of public transportation are generally 
safe at all times of the day; however, at night visitors 
should use common sense precautions so as to not become a 
target of opportunity. 
g.  (U) The traffic situation in Auckland can be difficult 
with a moderate amount of congestion.  Visitors are 
advised that traffic drives on the left-hand side of the 
road.  Visitors are advised that traffic accidents are 
common and that it is safe to pull over so that police may 
take an accident report.  However, visitors who experience 
hostility or anti-American sentiment should depart the 
scene immediately and notify the RSO. 
 
h.  (U) Precautions should also be taken to not discuss 
sensitive or classified information outside secure 
environments or over unsecured and/or cellular telephones, 
and to securely safeguard classified or sensitive 
information at the Chancery and not at hotels or 
residences. 
 
i.  (U) Visitors should also be aware of the State 
Department\'s Consular Information sheet for New Zealand 
and the most recent Worldwide Caution Public 
Announcements, which are available via the Internet at 
http://travel.state.gov 
 
j.  (U) In essence, visitors to New Zealand must exercise 
appropriate caution and be alert to their surroundings 
with regard to their personal security.  Suspicious 
incidents/activities should be reported to RSO Wellington 
(Telephone (64)(4)462-6000, 24 hours/day).

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND: AMBASSADOR SWINDELLS TELLS IT LIKE IT 
IS TO PM CLARK 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR CHARLES J. SWINDELLS, 
FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (U)  On November 17, Prime Minister Helen Clark delivered 
an address at the American Chamber of Commerce Business 
Awards.  She described the importance to New Zealand of its 
economic relationship with the United States: The U.S. is New 
Zealand\'s second-largest trading partner, with two-way trade 
close to NZD 8 billion (USD 6 billion) annually.  Exports to 
the United States are about 15 percent by value of New 
Zealand\'s global exports, and American companies account for 
over NZD 12 billion (USD 9 billion) in investment and \"many 
thousands\" of jobs.  The Prime Minister also highlighted New 
Zealand\'s continued interest in a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) 
with the United States.  She said that her country would 
continue \"to deploy diplomatic and other resources to build 
on our already considerable support in the United States\" for 
an FTA, and claimed she would also make the same point to 
President Bush when she had the opportunity to talk to him at 
the upcoming APEC summit in Chile. 
 
2.  (C) After the speech, Ambassador Swindells, who was 
sitting next to PM Clark, said that he understood from his 
most recent phone conversation with Ambassador Wood in 
Washington that New Zealand was planning a full lobbying 
effort with the new Congress in hopes of getting legislators\' 
support for a U.S.-New Zealand FTA.  She said yes -- New 
Zealand needs to have ties with the world\'s biggest economy. 
After noting that Congress (as does the Administration) 
remains appreciative of New Zealand\'s contributions to 
Afghanistan and Iraq, the Ambassador asked whether she was 
concerned that members of the Senate Armed Services Committee 
and others on the Hill might speak up against an FTA because 
of their strong feelings about New Zealand\'s anti-nuclear 
legislation.  At this, the Prime Minister fell silent. 
 
3.  (C) The Ambassador continued by noting that Congress 
would want to know if New Zealand would show any flexibility 
on the nuclear issue.  PM Clark responded that she welcomed 
the idea of a Coast Guard ship visit.  The Ambassador said 
that he had already suggested this, but that the Navy had 
said that a visit would send the wrong signal and he had to 
agree.  He said that if he raised the idea again, the Navy 
(and others in Washington) would ask him what the United 
States could expect from New Zealand in return.  Ambassador 
Swindells said that he thought Washington would want to know 
there would be movement on the NZ side, and welcomed PM 
Clark\'s thoughts on this. 
 
4.  (C) Earlier in the dinner, Ambassador Swindells asked 
whether PM Clark intended to invite the President to New 
Zealand.  She said yes, in conjunction with the 50th 
anniversaries of the U.S. and New Zealand bases in 
Antarctica.  She said that she believed the majority of New 
Zealanders would welcome such a visit. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  The Prime Minister has now heard directly 
the message that the Ambassador and the rest of the Embassy 
will convey in the months ahead: if New Zealand wants to 
further the bilateral relationship, it must reexamine the 
limits its nuclear policy has put on our ties.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND SPY \"SCANDAL\" - SECURITY INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICE UNDER INVESTIGATION 
 
Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION DAVID R. BURNETT, 
 FOR REASONS 1.4(B,D) 
 
1. (S) Summary: Prime Minister Helen Clark has assented to a 
request by the Inspector-General of Security to conduct an 
investigation into allegations reported by the New Zealand 
media that New Zealand\'s Security Intelligence Service (SIS) 
has been spying on members of the newly formed Maori Party. 
The reports were attributed to anonymous whistleblowers in 
the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, at least one 
of whom has since been identified as unaffiliated with the 
SIS.  The alleged spying (\"Operation Leaf\") supposedly 
gathered political intelligence on Maori through wiretaps and 
computer hacking.  Embassy Wellington RMAS dismisses the 
allegations; SIS contacts insist such domestic monitoring was 
discontinued a decade ago.  Some monitoring of Maori criminal 
groups may continue, but is conducted exclusively by the 
police service.  PM Clark has vehemently denied the 
allegations and thus far avoided political fallout, but has 
allowed an investigation by an independent supervisory body 
to proceed.  End summary. 
 
Legitimacy Of Media Sources Questioned 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Since November 21, New Zealand media have been 
reporting allegations that New Zealand\'s Security 
Intelligence Service (SIS) has been spying on members of the 
newly formed Maori Party.  Three dissident \"SIS operatives\" 
have claimed to local media that they had been assigned to 
monitor domestic Maori groups in New Zealand in order to get 
intelligence on tribal divisions, finances, and treaty claims 
and in general to get \"dirt\" on those targeted.  The PM 
called these claims a \"work of fiction\" and challenged the 
three spies to make their complaints through proper channels 
if they were to be considered credible.  One of the \"spies\" 
has been identified - New Zealand citizen Jack Sanders (aka 
James Thomas Stubbs).  Sanders has been described by a NZ 
Police spokesman as a subject of interest by the Police for 
\"dubious activities\" in Asia. 
 
3. (U) While PM Clark, who is also Minister for the SIS, has 
vehemently denied the allegations, she has assented to a 
request by the Inspector-General of Security, Justice Paul 
Neazor, to conduct an investigation.  This assent may be 
linked to a letter of complaint from political rival and 
Maori Party co-founder Tariana Turia to Neazor.  Turia told 
the press that her phone was bugged while she was leaving the 
Labour Party, although she also admitted that a private 
security firm she hired at that time told her it was unlikely 
SIS was involved. Turia also spoke with SIS head Richard 
Woods and stated that she has accepted his assurances her 
Maori Party was not a target. 
 
4. (S) Post\'s RMAS spoke with SIS contacts, who stated that 
the press claims are not credible.  They further stated that 
the SIS had monitored Maori groups in the past when they were 
considered a possible national security risk, but stopped 
doing so at least 10 years ago.  In fact, when the RMAS asked 
SIS last year if they were looking at Maori groups in the 
wake of press reports that some Maori were embracing radical 
Islam, SIS said no, as they thought the police were doing an 
adequate monitoring job. 
 
SIS Background 
-------------- 
 
5. (S) The SIS is one of four key elements in the GoNZ\'s 
security structure, which also includes the Government 
Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), the NZ Police and the 
NZ Defence Force\'s special forces.  These organs are 
coordinated by the Domestic and External Security Committee, 
based in the Department of PM and Cabinet.  The SIS is akin 
to both our FBI and CIA and spends about 90 percent of its 
resources on domestic security issues.  (It was authorized to 
conduct overseas operations in 1996.)  Its focus is on 
internal issues involving counter-terrorism (CT), 
counter-proliferation, counterespionage and organized crime, 
and it is just completing a restructuring plan in preparation 
for requesting more CT funding.  Neazor\'s investigation will 
be the first into NZ\'s counter-intelligence services since 
the 1996 reforms. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) The initial newspaper article, written by strong 
anti-Western columnist Nicky Hager, exploited public 
stereotypes with its allegations of a security apparatus 
running roughshod over civil liberties and with its overtones 
of racial profiling ) targeting law-abiding Maori.  However, 
Clark\'s decision to allow an inquiry should effectively stem 
any political fallout for her Labour Government, especially 
as further press reporting continues to undercut the media\'s 
initial claims.

1. (C) The Government of New Zealand formalized diplomatic 
relations with Cuba in 2001, with its Ambassador resident in 
Mexico City accredited to Havana.  The GoNZ uses meetings 
with Cuban officials to express its concern over the human 
rights situation in Cuba (ref B), according to Mike Shaw, 
Americas Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
This is consistent with the GoNZ\'s policy of engagement with 
states that have poor human rights records.  Post is unaware 
of any NZ entity or nationals who would be subject to Title 
III of the LIBERTAD Act.  The GoNZ would strenuously object 
to any effort to apply Title III to a NZ national or entity 
on extraterritorial grounds.  The GoNZ is strongly supportive 
of U.S. positions on Cuba\'s human rights record, and use of 
Title III would jeopardize continued good-faith cooperation. 
 
2. (SBU) Economically, Cuba was New Zealand\'s 45th largest 
trading partner in the year ending June 2004, with exports to 
Cuba at NZ$61.8 million (USD43.2 million) and imports at 
NZ$919,000 (USD643,000).  Of these exports, 97 percent were 
in the dairy sector, specifically milk powder.  Culturally, 
ties continue to strengthen.  In October, the Cuban 
Ambassador to New Zealand, who is resident in Canberra, 
hosted a film festival in New Zealand, in response to a New 
Zealand film festival held in Havana in February.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND AIDS CASES MINIMAL, BUT CONCERN 
INCREASING OVER COMPLACENCY TOWARDS TRANSMISSION 
 
 
 1. (U)  While the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 
New Zealand remains relatively small, the numbers have risen 
sharply in the past two years, with homosexual cases (53%) 
outnumbering heterosexual (21%) modes of transmission.  NZ 
Aids Foundation executive director Rachael Le Mesurier 
posited that this could be due to complacency and 
misinformation.  She noted that myths surrounding the use of 
HIV antri-retroviral drugs had led some in the homosexual 
community to stop using adequate protection.  Among 
heterosexual cases, the majority of the increase of HIV in 
2003/2004 is attributable to cases diagnosed initially 
outside of New Zealand. 
 
HIV/AIDS By the Numbers 
------------------------ 
 
2. (U) News reports on the morning of World AIDS Day stated 
that 819 cases of AIDS have been reported in New Zealand, and 
2,153 cases of HIV since 1985, when record keeping began. 
This represents 0.07 percent of NZ\'s total population, less 
than one fifth of the proportional US rate of infection.  In 
2003, 154 people were diagnosed with HIV or AIDS, and in the 
nine months to September 2004 a further 108 were diagnosed 
with HIV or AIDS.  Of the 2004 numbers, one quarter were 
women or children.  European men account for 49% of all 
cases, and \"other\" ethnicities, which would include large 
refugee populations, account for the next largest group 
(33%). 
 
International AIDS Efforts 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (U) In July, Minister for Aid/Development Marian Hobbs 
defended New Zealand in the wake of criticism by NGO World 
Vision that the GoNZ was not providing sufficient 
international support, noting that New Zealand has \"committed 
$6 million (US$4.2 million) to fight HIV/AIDS in the Pacific, 
and in May (2004) we contributed a further $3 million (US$2.1 
million) to international programmes such as UNAIDS and the 
Global Fund on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\"  In 
addition, NZAID maintains an Africa strategy that has 
HIV/AIDS as one of its three primary objectives, specifically 
providing support for affected communities.  Total 
contributions to the Africa HIV/AIDS strategy are around NZ$2 
million (US$1.4 million) for 2004/2005.  These combined 
contributions represent a little over 4 percent of NZ\'s total 
aid budget of NZ$260 million (US$182 million) for 2004.

TAGS: PGOV, NZ, PBIO 
SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT \"IN BALANCE\": ACT PARTY SWEARS IN 
REPLACEMENT TO ROGUE MP 
 
 
1. (U) ACT Party MP Kenneth Wang was sworn into Parliament 
November 30, replacing former ACT MP Donna Awatere Huata. 
Huata was removed from Parliament November 19, after losing a 
year-long court battle to retain her seat, which culminated 
in a Supreme Court hearing.  The Supreme Court, in its first 
substantive finding since its inception in January, ruled 
that Huata distorted the proportionality of Parliament by 
voting as an Independent, and that Huata had no legal basis 
on which to bar ACT from invoking the \"party-hopping\" clauses 
of the Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act in order to remove 
Huata from the Party and Parliament.  Speaker of the House 
Jonathan Hunt  announced Huata\'s seat vacant following the 
Supreme Court\'s finding. 
 
Fraud, Abuse, Recriminations 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (U)  Awatere Huata\'s troubles began in December 2002, with 
media accusing her of using funds from the children\'s reading 
program Pipi Foundation for a stomach stapling operation. 
The ACT Caucus voted to suspend her membership in February 
2003, and she has voted as an Independent since that date. 
Following an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, Huata 
and her husband Wi Huata will appear in court December 9 to 
face 19 counts of misusing checks and perverting the course 
of justice. 
 
New Zealand\'s Changing Demographic 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (U)  Kenneth Wang\'s entrance into Parliament as the first 
Chinese male MP reflects New Zealand\'s increasing diversity, 
and emphasizes the growing importance of the Asian 
electorate, although ACT has been quick to downplay the issue 
of ethnicity.  Wang, 39, was born in China, and emigrated to 
NZ in 1984.  Wang has spoken to the Press about his 
experiences during the Cultural Revolution, and the impact on 
him of witnessing the communist authorities, crackdown on 
dissent and intellectualism.  \"That taught me a lesson that 
the socialist ideology and way is often not the best way.\" 
Wang is managing director of his own small business 
Brandworks, an Auckland-based marketing and advertising 
agency.  He will be the ACT Party\'s Spokesman for Commerce 
and Small Business, and Associate Spokesperson for Education. 
 Wang is married to Li Ma, and has two children, Colin and 
Amy. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
4. (SBU)  Wang\'s entrance into Parliament will  provide ACT 
its full complement of 9 MPs out of 120.  This not only 
restores lost funding, but advances the Party ahead of the 
center-left Green Party (9 seats) for provision of questions, 
seating and speaking order.  While ACT\'s advancement is 
largely an issue of protocol, Hide likely hopes to capitalize 
on its better seating and increased number of questions to 
further its successful attacks on the Government, which most 
recently led to Labour MP John Tamihere\'s resignation from 
Cabinet.  ACT\'s financial boost, combined with the chance to 
refocus the substantial resources diverted to this case, 
could not come at a better time for a party polling at less 
than 3 percent, a far cry from their 7 percent take in the 
2002 election, and only half of the minimum 5 percent 
threshold for entry into Parliament.  ACT needs to focus on 
moving voters past the Huata scandal and onto its policies as 
the 2005 election looms.

4.  (SBU) All TDY visitors to Embassy Wellington are 
required to report to the Regional Security Office for a 
security briefing if they have not completed an approved 
overseas personal security training course. 
 
5.  (U) Visitors should use local taxi service, which is 
generally safe, reliable and frequent.  Taxi fare from the 
airport to downtown Wellington hotels is approximately 
NZD30.00. 
 
6.  (U) Travelers can exchange currency at the airport 
upon arrival and ATM machines are readily available 
throughout New Zealand.  Check cashing privileges at the 
Embassy are restricted to traveler\'s checks only up to 
USD100.00.  Personal checks will not be accepted. 
 
7.  (SBU) Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The Government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZD200.00 (USD150.00).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be 
administered immediately and without warnings. 
 
8.  (SBU) Security Information: 
 
a.  (SBU) All U.S. citizen personnel serving under the 
Chief of Mission authority in a temporary status of 30 
days or more must complete appropriate overseas personal 
security training prior to travel (04 State 66580). 
Employees who have completed the Security Overseas Seminar 
course at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) after June 
1, 2000, meet this requirement.  All other TDY personnel 
must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact 
for this training is Assistant Director for Training at 
(703) 205-2617.  Country clearance will not be granted for 
any traveler with planned TDY in excess of 30 days if this 
information is not stated/certified.  POC for additional 
information is RSO Wellington. 
 
b.  (SBU) The U.S. Mission in New Zealand currently rates 
the threat from transnational and indigenous terrorism as 
low.  There are no terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions 
in New Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, 
various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated 
occasionally at the Embassy in Wellington and at the 
Consulate in Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually 
small and are peacefully conducted.  During these 
demonstrations, the host country police and protective 
services normally provide adequate protection to the 
Embassy and Consulate. 
 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but 
they are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, 
home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine 
to Australia.  The most abused drugs in New Zealand are 
locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market. 
 
f.  (U) All forms of public transportation are generally 
safe at all times of the day; however, at night visitors 
should use common sense precautions so as to not become a 
target of opportunity. 
 
g.  (U) The traffic situation in Auckland can be difficult 
with a moderate amount of congestion.  Wellington and 
Christchurch traffic is significantly better; however, 
during rush hour moderate delays can be expected. 
Visitors are advised that traffic drives on the left-hand 
side of the road.  Visitors are advised that traffic 
accidents are common and that it is safe to pull over so 
that police may take an accident report.  However, 
visitors who experience hostility or anti-American 
sentiment should depart the scene immediately and notify 
the RSO. 
 
h.  (U) Precautions should also be taken to not discuss 
sensitive or classified information outside secure 
environments or over unsecured and/or cellular telephones, 
and to securely safeguard classified or sensitive 
information at the Chancery and not at hotels or 
residences. 
 
i.  (U) Visitors should also be aware of the State 
Department\'s Consular Information sheet for New Zealand 
and the most recent Worldwide Caution Public 
Announcements, which are available via the Internet at 
http://travel.state.gov 
 
j.  (U) In essence, visitors to New Zealand must exercise 
appropriate caution and be alert to their surroundings 
with regard to their personal security.  Suspicious 
incidents/activities should be reported to RSO Wellington 
(Telephone (64)(4)462-6000, 24 hours/day).

required to report to the Regional Security Office for a 
security briefing if they have not completed an approved 
overseas personal security training course. 
 
5.  (U) Visitors should use local taxi service, which is 
generally safe, reliable and frequent.  Taxi fare from the 
airport to downtown Christchurch hotels is approximately 
NZD35.00.  In Wellington, taxi fare is approximately 
NZD30.00. 
 
6.  (U) Travelers can exchange currency at the airport 
upon arrival and ATM machines are readily available 
throughout New Zealand.  Check cashing privileges at the 
Embassy are limited to traveler\'s checks only up to USD 
300.00 daily.  Personal checks will not be accepted. 
 
7.  (SBU) Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The Government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZD200.00 (USD150.00).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be 
administered immediately and without warnings. 
 
8.  (SBU) Security Information: 
 
a.  (SBU) All U.S. citizen personnel serving under the 
Chief of Mission authority in a temporary status of 30 
days or more must complete appropriate overseas personal 
security training prior to travel (04 State 66580). 
Employees who have completed the Security Overseas Seminar 
course at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) after June 
1, 2000, meet this requirement.  All other TDY personnel 
must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact 
for this training is Assistant Director for Training at 
(703) 205-2617.  Country clearance will not be granted for 
any traveler with planned TDY in excess of 30 days if this 
information is not stated/certified.  POC for additional 
information is RSO Wellington. 
 
b.  (SBU) The U.S. Mission in New Zealand currently rates 
the threat from transnational and indigenous terrorism as 
low.  There are no terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions 
in New Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, 
various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated 
occasionally at the Embassy in Wellington and at the 
Consulate in Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually 
small and are peacefully conducted.  During these 
demonstrations, the host country police and protective 
services normally provide adequate protection to the 
Embassy and Consulate. 
 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but 
they are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, 
home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine 
to Australia.  The most abused drugs in New Zealand are 
locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market. 
 
f.  (U) All forms of public transportation are generally 
safe at all times of the day; however, at night visitors 
should use common sense precautions so as to not become a 
target of opportunity. 
 
g.  (U) The traffic situation in Auckland can be difficult 
with a moderate amount of congestion.  Wellington and 
Christchurch traffic is significantly better; however, 
during rush hour moderate delays can be expected. 
Visitors are advised that traffic drives on the left-hand 
side of the road.  Visitors are advised that traffic 
accidents are common and that it is safe to pull over so 
that police may take an accident report.  However, 
visitors who experience hostility or anti-American 
sentiment should depart the scene immediately and notify 
the RSO. 
 
h.  (U) Precautions should also be taken to not discuss 
sensitive or classified information outside secure 
environments or over unsecured and/or cellular telephones, 
and to securely safeguard classified or sensitive 
information at the Chancery and not at hotels or 
residences. 
 
i.  (U) Visitors should also be aware of the State 
Department\'s Consular Information sheet for New Zealand 
and the most recent Worldwide Caution Public 
Announcements, which are available via the Internet at 
http://travel.state.gov 
 
j.  (U) In essence, visitors to New Zealand must exercise 
appropriate caution and be alert to their surroundings 
with regard to their personal security.  Suspicious 
incidents/activities should be reported to RSO Wellington 
(Telephone (64)(4)462-6000, 24 hours/day).

Classified by: DCM David R. Burnett.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) and 
(d). 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  After trying in vain for years to persuade 
the New Zealand government to change its restrictive pricing 
policies on pharmaceuticals, the drug industry is taking 
another tack: reaching out to patient groups with information 
designed to bolster their demands for cutting-edge drugs not 
already covered by government subsidy.  Several U.S. drug 
companies also hold out hope that a New Zealand-U.S. 
free-trade agreement could be a lever for improving their 
access to New Zealand\'s pharmaceutical market. 
 
2. (C) The government contends it already is increasing drug 
availability by boosting the budget for pharmaceutical 
purchases over the next three years.  In actuality, its 
spending on drugs in real terms is declining.  U.S. 
pharmaceutical companies continue to struggle in what they 
view as one of the most restricted free-world markets.  They 
are cutting local staff, and they are slashing investment in 
New Zealand-based research and development.  Attempting to 
make inroads against a government mindset that is hostile to 
the drug industry, post is working with the industry to 
identify speakers and engage in other public diplomacy 
efforts that could help educate New Zealanders on the 
benefits of gaining access to a wider range of effective 
pharmaceuticals.  End summary. 
 
Limited prices, limited access 
============================== 
3. (U) Spending in New Zealand on government-subsidized 
pharmaceuticals has risen by less than three percent per year 
on average during the last decade, compared to 14 percent per 
year in Australia.  Only six new drugs a year were approved 
on average over the last three years for reimbursement in New 
Zealand, compared to about 30 drugs in Australia.  The New 
Zealand government nevertheless asserts that it now is 
increasing the budget for pharmaceuticals sufficiently to 
subsidize more new medicines. 
 
4. (U) In fact, the pharmaceutical budget rose this fiscal 
year (ending June 30) by 4.4 percent, to NZ $541 million (US 
$380 million), with planned increases in the following two 
years of .5 percent and 1.9 percent.  The smaller increases 
in the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 budget years were based on the 
expectation that a number of expensive drugs will go off 
patent, according to Stuart Bruce, manager of communications 
and external relations for the Pharmaceutical Management 
Agency (Pharmac), a stand-alone Crown entity. 
 
5. (U) Exempt from New Zealand\'s competition law, Pharmac 
acts as a single buyer, or monopsony, that decides which 
medicines will be subsidized by the government and how much 
reimbursement will be paid for each pharmaceutical.  In some 
cases, the supplier is not allowed to set a drug price higher 
than the subsidy as determined by Pharmac.  The agency also 
puts a cap on the amount of a drug to be purchased at a 
certain price.  Its decisions effectively allocate about 73 
percent of New Zealand\'s spending on prescription drugs. 
Pharmac does not directly handle funding for the government\'s 
drug subsidy.  Those funds are dispersed by the national 
health care systems\' 21 district health boards to the 
pharmaceutical suppliers after a prescribed drug is dispensed 
to the consumer. 
 
6. (SBU) Bruce noted that Pharmac always under-spends its 
budget because government policy prohibits exceeding it. 
That means that actual public spending on pharmaceuticals is 
likely to remain relatively flat or even decline in real 
terms over the next three years.  Further explaining why 
Pharmac spends less than planned, Bruce said that some 
patients do not pick up their prescriptions because of 
co-payment delays.  Spending projections also are based on 
the assumption that patients will consume their entire 
prescription.  Since pharmacists receive a fee each time they 
dispense a medication, they usually break a prescription into 
installments, and some patients do not purchase an entire 
prescription. 
7. (C) Pharmac designated 15 new products for reimbursement 
the past fiscal year, up from three new drugs in 2002-2003. 
U.S. pharmaceutical firms we talked to, however, point out 
that only one of those new medicines is freely available. 
Access to the other medicines is available only after doctors 
make special application or when patients meet specific 
criteria.  For example, only specialists can prescribe a new 
treatment for diabetes.  The drug\'s manufacturer believes 
2,000 to 3,000 of the more than 100,000 diabetics in New 
Zealand could benefit from the medicine.  But with just 50 
specialists nationwide, most patients are under the care of 
general practitioners, and obtaining the drug is difficult. 
Another company reported that six out of 10 applications by 
doctors for reimbursement for its schizophrenia drug are 
rejected. 
 
8. (C) The industry also criticizes Pharmac for a lack of 
transparency in its funding decisions.  One U.S. company 
spent more than three years negotiating with Pharmac to gain 
public funding for a schizophrenia treatment.  Without 
explanation (none is required), Pharmac broke off those 
discussions this year. 
 
9. (U) The New Zealand industry group Researched Medicines 
Industry (RMI) said in a statement that Pharmac is using 
\"smoke and mirrors\" to portray itself as widening New 
Zealanders\' access to pharmaceuticals.  Since leading-edge 
medicines generally are not subsidized, they are available 
only to those who can pay the full cost, RMI said. 
 
10. (SBU) Publicly, Pharmac contends that it delivers the 
best health-care outcomes possible within the funding 
available, citing the fact that the volume of subsidized 
pharmaceuticals has increased while prices in general have 
declined.  Pharmac highlights the savings it reaps -- NZ $25 
million (US $17.5 million) the past fiscal year -- that would 
have been spent on the drug subsidy without its intervention 
to lower prices.  Privately, Wayne McNee, Pharmac\'s chief 
executive officer, acknowledged that the principal obstacle 
to funding more medicines is the government\'s reluctance to 
increase the pharmaceutical budget.  On that, both he and the 
industry agree. 
 
IPR and advertising under threat 
================================ 
11. (U) U.S. pharmaceutical companies consider New Zealand\'s 
patent protection to be inadequate.  Pharmac controls 
pharmaceutical prices partly through \"reference pricing\" -- 
determining the level of subsidy based on the lowest-priced 
product in a therapeutic subgroup.  The subgroup includes 
medicines that are similarly effective in treating the same 
or similar conditions.  This policy often pits patented 
products against lower-priced generics and does not reward 
innovation.  Pharmac\'s general practice is to designate for 
subsidy only one drug per therapeutic class. 
 
12. (U) The New Zealand government also has refused to extend 
the effective patent life of drugs, which now stands at seven 
years on average (ref A).  One U.S. company views the issue 
as irrelevant, since Pharmac\'s reference pricing undermines 
its patents\' commercial value anyway.  Most companies see the 
government\'s position on effective patent life as further 
evidence of its disregard for the pharmaceutical industry. 
Further eroding their patents\' worth is the so-called 
springboarding provision in New Zealand\'s patent law, which 
allows generic competitors to start the process of seeking 
market approval while a proprietary drug is still under 
patent. 
 
13. (C) In addition, U.S. pharmaceutical companies continue 
to worry that the government will ban direct-to-consumer 
advertising, one of the industry\'s few pathways around 
Pharmac\'s controls (ref C).  Several companies, especially 
those marketing so-called lifestyle drugs for such conditions 
as hair loss and erectile dysfunction, have built sales 
through advertising.  Unsubsidized drugs accounted for 30 
percent of sales for Merck Sharp & Dohme, 25 percent for 
Pfizer, 20 to 25 percent for Pfizer, 20 percent for Johnson & 
Johnson, 15 percent for Eli Lilly and less than 6 percent for 
GlaxoSmithKline this year in New Zealand.  Health Minister 
Annette King and Pharmac oppose direct-to-consumer 
advertising (DTCA) partly because they believe it tends to 
increase expenditures on pharmaceuticals.  DTCA also 
pressures Pharmac to explain why it does not fund certain 
advertised drugs.  Companies are wary of the New Zealand 
government using a joint regulatory agency it is establishing 
with Australia as a vehicle for banning DTCA, which is not 
allowed in Australia.  However, the Australian High 
Commission told post that such a decision is for the New 
Zealand government alone to make. 
 
A big hit on industry 
===================== 
14.  (U) From Pharmac\'s pricing policies to the government\'s 
positions on intellectual property and direct-to-consumer 
advertising, U.S. pharmaceutical companies consider New 
Zealand to be hostile ground.  Unable to meet their sales and 
profit targets, they say it is becoming increasingly 
difficult to persuade their home offices to keep investments 
or even a presence in the country. 
 
15. (C) As a result, almost all U.S. companies in New Zealand 
have scaled back their staffs and their 
research-and-development investments since Pharmac was formed 
in 1993.  During the past year, Eli Lilly cut 20 percent of 
its staff to 27 people, from a peak of 70 employees in the 
mid-1990s.  GlaxoSmithKline has reduced its staff by 65 
percent, down to about 50 people.  Pfizer downsized its 
pharmaceutical division by 15 percent, to 60 people.  Johnson 
& Johnson two years ago cut its staff by 10 percent, and Jan 
Trotman, its general manager in New Zealand, said that if 
conditions do not improve in 2005, the company could leave 
the country in three to five years.  (Some staff cuts are due 
to the shifting of regulatory oversight from New Zealand to 
Australia with the scheduled launch of the trans-Tasman 
agency in July 2005.)  The exception is Merck, where 
employment has remained stable and sales have increased, 
partly because of its higher sales of vaccines. 
 
16. (C) Because of the difficult environment, all the 
companies have reduced -- and, in some cases, ceased -- 
investment in research and development in New Zealand (ref 
B).  Eli Lilly is completing two clinical trials, but 
otherwise has transferred all its research and development. 
Ten years ago, every U.S. drug company in New Zealand 
employed a medical director.  Now, only Merck has one. 
Ironically, New Zealand presents a small but optimal 
environment for clinical trials of pharmaceuticals because of 
its population\'s lack of exposure to newer medicines. 
Minister King had threatened to end clinical trials unless 
patients participating in a trial had free, lifetime access 
to the medicine once the trial ended.  Other cabinet 
ministers told her to stop making that threat. 
 
17. (SBU) Nearly every company said it was holding out some 
of its newer medicines from New Zealand because of the 
expectation that prices and sales volumes would be too low. 
For the New Zealand consumer, the result is less access to 
modern medicines. 
 
Times they are a-changin\'? 
========================== 
18. (SBU) Pharmaceutical companies see ideological opposition 
to their industry in comments by Prime Minister Clark, Health 
Minister King and other cabinet members.  One pharmaceutical 
executive recalled how, upon simply introducing himself at a 
public forum, the Prime Minister said the drug industry 
needed to be \"stopped\" from making excessive profits.  (The 
industry may be paying a price for its unsuccessful effort in 
1990 to unseat Clark, who at the time was health minister.) 
Health Minister King has publicly equated the pharmaceutical 
industry with the tobacco industry.  When several companies 
warned her that her government\'s policies would force the 
industry out of New Zealand, she responded that she was not 
concerned because New Zealand could always shop overseas for 
its drugs. 
 
19. (SBU) Amid such perceived hostility, there have been 
subtle changes.  In the past couple years, RMI and Pharmac 
have worked to maintain dialogue, although RMI in recent 
months under a new chairman -- a general practitioner -- has 
more aggressively promoted the industry\'s views in the media. 
 While drug companies remain unhappy with Pharmac\'s 
practices, they see capped government funding, rather than 
Pharmac itself, as their primary problem.  Several companies 
noted an emerging public debate over access to medicines, a 
discussion that was nonexistent even a couple years ago. 
Public attitudes are changing slowly.  As Alister Brown, 
Merck New Zealand\'s chief executive, noted, consumers five 
years ago assumed that if Pharmac did not fund a drug, it was 
not worth having.  An increasing number of consumers are now 
willing to pay for non-subsidized drugs. 
 
20. (C) Finding that its direct pressure failed to alter the 
government mindset, the industry is now firing up pressure 
from below.  For the last six months, RMI has been working 
with patient groups to make them aware of cutting-edge 
pharmaceuticals that are not being subsidized in New Zealand. 
 Lesley Clarke, RMI\'s chief executive officer, hopes this 
effort will result in increased pressure on the government to 
hike funding for drugs.  Although Clarke said it would be too 
early to see results of RMI\'s efforts, New Zealand newspapers 
in recent months have reported complaints by patient groups 
over the lack of funding for drugs to treat breast cancer, 
Alzheimer\'s disease, and growth hormone problems. 
 
21. (SBU) New Zealand\'s doctors would appear to be likely 
cheerleaders for greater access to pharmaceuticals.  However, 
industry market research shows that fewer than 20 percent of 
New Zealand\'s doctors would tell their patients of non-funded 
alternatives to subsidized medications.  The drug companies 
contend that doctors are reluctant to publicly call for 
change. 
 
22. (C) A possible U.S.-New Zealand free-trade agreement 
(FTA) offers one last avenue for changing government policies 
that limit access to pharmaceuticals, several U.S. companies 
said.  Meanwhile, Geoff Dangerfield, chief executive of the 
New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development, told a U.S. 
drug company that his government terminated its study of 
patent term extension for pharmaceuticals to keep the issue 
as a bargaining chip in the event of FTA negotiations.  If 
FTA talks go forward, most of the drug companies will be 
looking to the U.S. government to win serious concessions 
from New Zealand on pharmaceutical issues.  Pfizer, which 
withdrew from RMI early this year, will oppose free-trade 
negotiations until the New Zealand government alters some of 
its policies, especially its patent law and reference pricing. 
 
Post\'s strategy 
=============== 
23. (SBU) The challenge is compounded by New Zealand\'s 
escalating health-care costs and an aging population. 
Overall health-care spending has risen faster than any 
government budget category since 1994 and now comprises about 
20 percent of the government budget.  In the meantime, the 
government\'s effort to reduce the cost of seeing a doctor has 
led to more patient visits, more prescriptions, and more 
purchased pharmaceuticals.  As a result, Bruce of Pharmac 
said his agency would face more pressure to ration its budget 
or seek a larger portion of the already stressed health 
budget. 
 
24. (C) To complement the industry\'s efforts, post will work 
with companies to identify U.S. speakers to be brought to New 
Zealand and possible International Visitor Program 
participants, with the goal of educating New Zealand\'s health 
practitioners, policymakers and consumers on pharmaceuticals\' 
role in health care.  These programs will emphasize the 
advantages of expanded access to medicines and treatment 
options and the link between pharmaceutical research and 
development and the biotechnology industry, which the New 
Zealand government prominently supports as a means to 
economic growth.  By keeping drug expenses artificially low, 
the New Zealand government is denying consumers access to 
many modern medicines and failing to bear an equitable 
portion of the cost of developing drugs.  Over the long term, 
post hopes its efforts will help New Zealand strike a balance 
between providing affordable medicines and supporting an 
industry that creates cures for disease.

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND CABINET RESHUFFLE: FIRST UP, 
CONTROVERSIAL CHOICE FOR SPEAKER 
 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC COUNSELOR KATHERINE HADDA, 
FOR REASONS 1.4(B,D) 
 
1. (U)  Summary: The Labour Government took its first steps 
in a long-heralded Cabinet reshuffle, with the December 14 
nomination of current Attorney-General Margaret Wilson for 
the position of Speaker of the House.  The Speaker is the 
third highest office in the country and, while the role is 
non-partisan, Speakers do maintain links to their nominating 
party.  Wilson\'s selection came as a surprise as Defense 
Minister Mark Burton had long been tipped as the 
front-runner, and Opposition parties had informally approved 
of the choice.  The switch to party-ideologue Wilson has 
inflamed opposition parties, who argue that she lacks the 
necessary experience for the job.  However, her confirmation 
is likely, and has now raised interest among Labour MPs as to 
who will take over her three portfolios: as Attorney General, 
Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister and Commerce 
Minister.  With very few Ministerial portfolios deemed 
secure, the full reshuffle (expected within the next week) 
has sparked intense lobbying and speculation.  End summary. 
 
Opposition Inflamed 
------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Labour Government took its first steps in a 
long-awaited Cabinet reshuffle, with the December 14 
nomination of current Attorney-General Margaret Wilson for 
the position of Speaker of the House.  Under Labour\'s system 
of nomination, the full caucus votes on who is allowed into 
Parliament, but decisions on the distribution of portfolios 
are made by PM Clark.  Wilson\'s selection came as a surprise 
as Defense Minister Mark Burton had long been tipped as the 
front-runner, and Opposition parties had informally approved 
of the choice.  Opposition National Deputy Leader Gerry 
Brownlee savaged Wilson\'s selection, noting that \"respect is 
earned, but granted by appointment.\"  ACT MP Richard Prebble 
categorized the nomination as part of \"Helen Clark\'s 
gender-promoting strategy,\" and NZ First leader Winston 
Peters carped that his party had not been consulted.  Despite 
these objections, Wilson is likely to be confirmed with a 
solid majority, as both the United Future and Green parties 
have agreed to support Labour and the Progressives. 
 
Role of the Speaker 
------------------- 
 
3. (U)  The Speaker of the House is the highest office in the 
House, and third in the country, after the Governor General 
and the PM.  While the role is non-partisan, and the Speaker 
may not display favor for one party over another, Speakers do 
maintain links to their nominating party.  In addition to 
these roles within Parliament, the Speaker presides over 
select committees including the Business Committee, the 
Officers of Parliament Committee and the Standing Orders 
Committee. The Speaker also has statutory responsibilities 
for the Controller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman and the 
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment.  Current 
Speaker Jonathan Hunt will be departing the post in March to 
become High Commissioner to London.  Under NZ\'s Mixed-Member 
Proportional system, he will be replaced in Parliament by the 
next on the Labour Party list, Lesley Soper, Labour Party 
Women\'s Vice President. 
 
Wilson\'s Labour Credentials 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (U)  Wilson was President of the Labour Party from 1984 - 
1987, and is widely seen as one of the more uncompromising 
MPs over NZ\'s anti-nuclear legislation.  Wilson was then 
chief advisor to Labour PM Sir Geoffrey Palmer, and following 
that dean and professor of law at Waikato University.  She 
was elected to Parliament in 1999, and the Opposition has 
pointed out her lack of experience in Opposition in 
condemning her nomination.  Wilson has dismissed this concern 
noting that she is efficient and organized, and will be able 
to learn \"on the job.\"  Earlier in the year Wilson had 
publicly spoken of a desire to leave Parliament and return to 
academia, but was convinced by the caucus to stay. 
 
Is there a lawyer in the house? 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Wilson\'s nomination has not only set the Opposition 
boiling, but has raised interest among Labour MPs as to who 
will take over her three portfolios, as Attorney General, 
Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister and Commerce 
Minister.  The Attorney General is the senior law officer of 
the Crown as well as having responsibility for the Crown Law 
Office, the Serious Fraud Office and the Parliamentary 
Counsel Office.  This combination requires the incumbent to 
combine the obligation to act in a non-partisan matter on 
some issues with the political partisanship of being a 
Minister.  Speculation on her replacement is rife, as a 
lawyer has traditionally held the role of Attorney General, 
but Labour has only 5 lawyers.  These include two first-term 
MPs plus disgraced Ministers John Tamihere and Lianne 
Dalziel.  Michael Cullen and Phil Goff (who is not a lawyer) 
are considered the most likely candidates for the post, but 
this would require either of the men to give up another 
portfolio. 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
6. (C)  Although unexpected, Wilson has publicly expressed 
dissatisfaction with her portfolios, and is not seen as 
widely supported by business.  Clark\'s decision to move her 
from active portfolios to the Speaker\'s job is likely a plum 
offered as an enticement for Wilson to remain in Parliament 
through the next election.  Wilson\'s nomination has throw 
Parliament and the media into a frenzy, as previously \"safe\" 
portfolios are now open to reexamination and possible 
redistribution.  In terms of personal politics, Wilson is 
widely seen as one of the more uncompromising MPs over NZ\'s 
anti-nuclear legislation, as she was integral in its passage. 
 Her confirmation as Speaker means she will no longer attend 
Cabinet meetings, removing a strong anti-nuclear voice from 
the fray.  However, she and Helen Clark are very close 
personal friends, and she undoubtedly has the ear of the PM. 
 
7.  (C) Wilson\'s move comes among intense speculation that 
other, unrelated Cabinet shuffles are in the works, to be 
announced within the week.  According to Parliamentary 
insiders, the PM has reportedly said that only the Finance 
and Foreign Affairs portfolios \"need stability\" and will not 
change.  While their portfolios may not change drastically, 
the competition among ministers to prove their worth has 
intensified.  Stay tuned.

SUBJECT: SENATOR BAUCUS AND AMBASSADOR GIVE STRAIGHT TALK 
ON FTA TO NEW ZEALAND TRADE MINISTER 
 
REF: WELLINGTON 36 
 
Classified by: DCM David R. Burnett.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) and 
(d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: In a meeting December 2 at the Auckland 
airport, Senator Max Baucus (D-Montana) and the Ambassador 
warned New Zealand Minister for Trade Negotiations Jim Sutton 
that his government faces a tough time trying to persuade the 
U.S. government to start free-trade talks.  While emphasizing 
their personal support for such talks, they identified the 
New Zealand government\'s anti-nuclear policy as a major 
obstacle to deepening the bilateral relationship, including 
negotiation of a free-trade agreement.  The discussion 
underscored the message of Codel Nickles (reftel) in January 
2004 on New Zealand\'s chances for a free-trade deal and the 
nuclear issue\'s impact on the bilateral relationship.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (U) Minister Sutton, who raised the free-trade issue, 
noted the importance to New Zealand of a deal with the United 
States, especially because of the expected diversion of 
investment from New Zealand to Australia due to the 
Australia-U.S. trade agreement.  Sutton had just returned 
from the Association of South East Asian Nations summit 
meeting in Laos and was accompanied by Simon Murdoch, the 
chief executive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
 
 
3. (C) Senator Baucus said that the U.S. administration was 
assessing entire bilateral relationships -- including 
economic and security issues -- in deciding which countries 
to put in queue for free-trade negotiations.  He expected 
that approach to harden in the administration\'s second term 
as views within the White House become more consolidated. 
Thus, the Senator predicted that New Zealand\'s 1986 
legislation barring the entry of nuclear weapons and 
nuclear-powered ships into its territory would make it tough 
to get free-trade negotiations going.  In providing this 
direct assessment, the Senator implied that he nonetheless 
supported starting talks now with New Zealand based on the 
economic benefits to the United States. 
 
4. (C) The Senator, who was accompanied by selected members 
of his trade delegation, said that there should be give and 
take on both sides, and that there should be some way that 
New Zealand could meet the United States half way on the 
nuclear issue. 
 
5. (C) Sutton said he had often heard from Washington of the 
fear of \"New Zealand fever\" -- its anti-nuclear policy -- 
spreading, but that he was not certain that such fear was an 
issue or obstacle to trade negotiations. 
 
6. (C) The Ambassador responded that, because of regional 
security conditions, New Zealand\'s policy is more important 
to the United States today than it was in 1986.  He 
acknowledged the need to articulate publicly the reasons why 
the United States remains concerned by the policy.  He noted 
that other countries that are as sensitive to the nuclear 
issue as New Zealand -- such as Japan and South Korea -- have 
found a way around the issue because of the importance of 
national security and of their relationships to the United 
States. 
 
7. (C) Murdoch said he hoped a \"report card\" on the New 
Zealand-U.S. relationship would reflect New Zealand\'s efforts 
and give the United States reason to bolster it.  He pointed 
out New Zealand\'s support for the reconstruction efforts in 
Afghanistan and Iraq and the sharing of intelligence.  The 
Ambassador confirmed the U.S. government\'s appreciation for 
New Zealand\'s cooperation in many areas, including customs 
and intelligence gathering.  However, the U.S. government did 
not consider New Zealand to be pulling its weight in defense 
and security matters.  He thought Australia shared that view. 
 
8. (C) Murdoch asserted that the anti-nuclear policy would be 
difficult, if not impossible, to change.  The policy had 
become ingrained politically in New Zealand, its citizens 
even more than the government supported it, and even the 
opposition was reluctant to deal with the issue.  The 
Ambassador, who stressed that he and the Embassy supported 
free-trade negotiations between New Zealand and the United 
States, said that when two countries want something, 
everything should be on the table. 
 
9. (C) The Senator agreed.  Unless the nuclear issue were 
addressed, it would be tough to get the U.S. administration 
to start free-trade negotiations.  Somehow, the two parties 
needed to quietly work together to resolve the matter. 
 
10. (C) The Ambassador recalled that he had attempted to 
address the issue two years ago by arranging for a visit to 
New Zealand by a U.S. Coast Guard ship.  However, he ran into 
strong opposition from certain members of the White House, 
Pentagon and State Department.  It was their feeling that the 
United States had been the more flexible of the two countries 
and that New Zealand had made no effort to find a way around 
the issue. 
 
11. (C) The Senator and Ambassador pointed out that both 
countries cooperated well on a number of issues but that, 
while the bilateral relationship was good, it needed to go to 
another level.  The meeting ended on a cordial and friendly 
note, with Sutton and Murdoch appearing to appreciate the 
forthrightness of their discussion with the Senator and 
Ambassador. 
 
12. (C) Comment: Senator Baucus has been identified by the 
New Zealand government as a strong advocate for its effort to 
achieve free-trade negotiations with the United States. 
Therefore, we expect that his candid assessment of the 
challenges faced by New Zealand -- and the importance of 
dealing with the nuclear issue -- in its pursuit of a 
free-trade deal carried credibility.  Post also notes that in 
the meeting there was no discussion of how the United States 
might benefit economically from a trade agreement. 
 
13. (U) Senator Baucus did not have an opportunity to clear 
this cable.

7.  (SBU) Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The Government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZD200.00 (USD150.00).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be 
administered immediately and without warnings. 
 
8.  (SBU) Security Information: 
 
a.  (SBU) All U.S. citizen personnel serving under the 
Chief of Mission authority in a temporary status of 30 
days or more must complete appropriate overseas personal 
security training prior to travel (04 State 66580). 
Employees who have completed the Security Overseas Seminar 
course at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) after June 
1, 2000, meet this requirement.  All other TDY personnel 
must either (1) complete the approved seminar at FSI 
entitled \"Serving Abroad for Families and Employees\" 
(SAFE), or (2) have their agency certify to the Department 
of State\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security that the employee 
has undergone equivalent security training.  The contact 
for this training is Assistant Director for Training at 
(703) 205-2617.  Country clearance will not be granted for 
any traveler with planned TDY in excess of 30 days if this 
information is not stated/certified.  POC for additional

b.  (SBU) The U.S. Mission in New Zealand currently rates 
the threat from transnational and indigenous terrorism as 
low.  There are no terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions

various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated 
occasionally at the Embassy in Wellington and at the 
Consulate in Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually 
small and are peacefully conducted.  During these 
demonstrations, the host country police and protective 
services normally provide adequate protection to the 
Embassy and Consulate. 
 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but 
they are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, 
home invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are 
becoming more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur 
countrywide but primarily in the large cities of Auckland, 
Christchurch and Wellington, and visitors should be 
especially aware that street crime, such as scams and 
pickpockets is a daily occurrence in these cities.  Common 
sense precautions should be taken, especially at night, to 
avoid becoming a target of opportunity. 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a 
significant role in the world drug situation; however, 
evidence indicates that New Zealand has been utilized as a 
transit point for shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine 
to Australia.  The most abused drugs in New Zealand are 
locally produced methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have 
been increased amounts of lab seizures and violent crime 
associated with groups attempting to control this market. 
 
f.  (U) All forms of public transportation are generally 
safe at all times of the day; however, at night visitors 
should use common sense precautions so as to not become a 
target of opportunity. 
 
g.  (U) The traffic situation in Auckland can be difficult 
with a moderate amount of congestion.  Wellington and 
Christchurch traffic is significantly better; however, 
during rush hour moderate delays can be expected. 
Visitors are advised that traffic drives on the left-hand 
side of the road.  Visitors are advised that traffic 
accidents are common and that it is safe to pull over so 
that police may take an accident report.  However, 
visitors who experience hostility or anti-American 
sentiment should depart the scene immediately and notify 
the RSO. 
 
h.  (U) Precautions should also be taken to not discuss 
sensitive or classified information outside secure 
environments or over unsecured and/or cellular telephones, 
and to securely safeguard classified or sensitive 
information at the Chancery and not at hotels or 
residences. 
 
i.  (U) Visitors should also be aware of the State 
Department\'s Consular Information sheet for New Zealand 
and the most recent Worldwide Caution Public 
Announcements, which are available via the Internet at 
http://travel.state.gov 
 
j.  (U) In essence, visitors to New Zealand must exercise

1.  Post offers the following submission for this year\'s 
terrorism report: 
 
BEGIN TEXT OF SUBMISSION 
 
2.  New Zealand has implemented all 12 UN terrorism 
conventions.  A Counter-terrorism bill passed in October 2003 
increased the government\'s ability to prosecute terrorist 
activities and threats.  The legislation ascribes severe 
penalties for dealing with unmarked plastics explosives and 
nuclear or radioactive material, harboring terrorists, 
contaminating food or water, and other terrorism-related 
offenses.  The 2003 bill follows directly from the Terrorism 
Suppression Act of October 2002, which allowed New Zealand to 
become a party to the UN Conventions on Terrorism Bombings 
and Terrorist Financing. 
3.  In December 2004, the Government introduced a bill into 
Parliament to extend by two years New Zealand\'s UN Security 
Council-related designations of terrorism organizations.  As 
passed, the 2002 bill mandates that all such designations 
expire in 2005 unless renewed by order of New Zealand\'s High 
Court.  The new bill would push that date to 2007.   As of 
December 2004, New Zealand had designated 420 terrorist 
organizations and was considering adding more to the list. 
4.  In September 2003, New Zealand appointed its first 
Ambassador for Counter-terrorism to coordinate New Zealand\'s 
response to terrorist acts, monitor international 
developments, and attend international meetings, in order to 
ensure that New Zealand has a stronger capacity to develop 
and implement policies on global terrorism and related 
security issues.   In its 2004 budget, New Zealand allocated 
funds for the creation of specially-dedicated National 
Security Teams to counter terrorism.  In May 2004, New 
Zealand hosted a counter-terrorism meeting for Pacific Island 
Forum members.  The meeting, which was funded through the 
Government\'s Pacific Island Security Fund, discussed the 
region\'s counter-terrorism obligations and the range of 
international assistance available to help countries meet 
these requirements. 
5.  New Zealand relies heavily on its aviation sector for 
tourism and to remain connected to the rest of the world, and 
takes seriously its security obligations under the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  New 
Zealand expects to have ICAO-mandated explosive detection 
systems in place at New Zealand\'s international airports by 
October 2005. 
6.  New Zealand continues to support Operation Enduring 
Freedom in Afghanistan, including by leading the Provincial 
Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Bamiyan.  The country deployed 
61 military engineers (the Light Engineering Group, or LEG) 
to Iraq for one year to aid in reconstruction efforts there. 
 The Government allocated NZD 10 million (about USD 7.2 
million) for each of fiscal years 2003/4 and 2004/5 for aid 
and development work in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The money was 
disbursed through the PRT\'s and LEG\'s reconstruction work, as 
well as through the UN and NGOs.

IMPORT POLICIES 
 
In general, tariff rates in New Zealand are low as a result 
of several rounds of unilateral tariff cuts that began in the 
mid-1980s and continued until the current Labor government, 
elected in 1999, decided to freeze further reductions until 
at least July 2005.  The New Zealand government announced in 
September 2003 that it would resume unilateral tariff 
reductions.  On July 1, 2006, New Zealand plans to begin 
gradually reducing its highest tariff rates of between 17 
percent and 19 percent to 10 percent by July 1, 2009.  The 
top rates apply mostly to clothing, footwear, carpets, and 
certain autos and auto parts.  Ad valorem tariffs on other 
goods also will gradually be reduced to 5 percent by July 1, 
2008.  The New Zealand government will conduct a review in 
2006 to determine rates after July 1, 2009. 
 
STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING AND CERTIFICATION 
 
Biotechnology Commercial Release Moratorium 
New Zealand\'s Parliament passed the New Organisms and Other 
Matters (NOOM) Bill 2003 on October 14, 2003, ending New 
Zealand,s moratorium on acceptance of applications for the 
commercial release of products produced through modern 
agricultural biotechnology into the environment. The new law 
put in place a revised regulatory framework by amending the 
Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act 1996, under 
which the moratorium was scheduled to sunset on October 29, 
2003. New Zealand\'s commercial release moratorium had 
precluded applications for the commercial planting of 
biotechnology crops, the commercial importation of 
biotechnology seeds, and the release into the environment of 
biotechnology animals. It did not, however, affect the use 
and sale of processed biotechnology foods and ingredients or 
veterinary medicines. 
 
The NOOM Bill 2003 provides for a new conditional release 
category of approval for new organisms, including 
biotechnology products. This will permit New Zealand\'s 
Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA) to accept for 
review and its approval applications for release of 
biotechnology products with controls applied on a 
case-by-case basis. Under the provisions of the NOOM Bill, 
ERMA now will be able to approve a conditional release for 
biotechnology products that will allow field trial activity 
to expand from the limited scope of a fully contained trial 
to larger farm scale, encouraging ongoing research activity 
in New Zealand. Products from large-scale conditional field 
trials that ERMA may now approve could be sold domestically 
if the terms of project approval do not explicitly preclude 
such sales. 
 
A Member of Parliament representing New Zealand,s Green 
Party is sponsoring an amendment to the HSNO Act, which would 
reinstate the ban on the commercial release of genetically 
modified organisms into the environment until 2008. The bill 
is not likely to receive its first reading in Parliament 
before early 2005. After the first reading, Members of 
Parliament will vote on whether the bill should move forward 
to a select committee or be removed. 
 
Biotechnology Food Approval 
Imported biotechnology foods can be offered for sale and 
consumption in New Zealand after being assessed and approved 
by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) under 
delegated authority of the New Zealand Food Safety Authority 
(NZFSA). In mid-1999, a mandatory standard for foods produced 
using modern biotechnology came into effect. The standard 
established under the Food Act 1981 prohibits the sale of 
food produced using gene technology, unless the food has been 
assessed by FSANZ and listed in the food code standard. FSANZ 
had received 28 applications for safety assessments of 
bioengineered foods as of March 2004. Of these, 23 had been 
approved, four applications were being processed, and one 
approval request was withdrawn. 
 
Biotechnology Food Labeling 
Mandatory labeling requirements for foods produced using gene 
technology became effective in December 2001. Biotechnology 
labeling is required if a food in its final form contains 
detectable DNA or protein resulting from the application of 
biotechnology, with a few exceptions. Meeting New Zealand\'s 
biotechnology food labeling regulations places a burden on 
manufacturers, packers, importers, and retailers. They are 
especially relevant for U.S. agricultural exports, which 
consist primarily of processed food. Wholesalers and 
retailers frequently demand biotechnology-free declarations 
from their supplier/importer, which passes liability in the 
event of biotechnology labeling non-compliance back to the 
importer. New Zealand food legislation requires businesses to 
exercise due diligence in complying with food standards, 
which usually is defined as maintaining a paper or audit 
trail similar to a quality assurance system. 
 
The NZFSA conducts periodic compliance audits. Individuals 
and companies found to be in non-compliance with 
biotechnology food labeling requirements may be assessed 
penalties under the Food Act 1981. The New Zealand government 
is reviewing authorized penalties stipulated under the act to 
make sure that they represent an adequate economic deterrent. 
New Zealand food retailers are discouraged from sourcing 
biotechnology food products, in part because of these 
regulations. 
 
A retail food audit conducted by NZFSA in September 2004 
reportedly found 17 of the 117 processed products evaluated 
to have genetically modified (GM) content that exceeded a 1 
percent threshold. These included two products that had been 
labeled as GM-free, which were referred to the New Zealand 
Commerce Commission for action under the Fair Trading Act 
1986. Additional NZFSA measures were taken to ensure that 
companies involved with those products whose labels failed to 
provide information on their GM content, but did not have 
false GM-free declarations, meet future labeling compliance 
standards. 
 
Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures 
New Zealand maintains a strict regime of SPS control for 
virtually all imports of agricultural products. The United 
States and New Zealand have held discussions on New 
Zealand,s highly conservative regulatory approach as well as 
on specific SPS issues. The two sides continue to make 
progress in addressing specific issues that negatively impact 
trade in products supplied by the United States. 
 
Beef. U.S. beef and beef variety meats were restricted from 
entering New Zealand following the December 2003 announcement 
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United 
States. Import restrictions also have been imposed on live 
cattle, certain pet food, non-protein free edible tallow, and 
U.S. processed food products containing beef such as soups or 
those containing gelatin made from bovine bone material. New 
Zealand imports of U.S. bovine products for human consumption 
now require assessment and approval by NZFSA on a 
case-by-case basis before importation. This can be time 
consuming, results in additional costs to importers and 
exporters, and deters sales. As of early December 2004, the 
NZFSA had not yet responded to a U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) request for New Zealand to accept U.S. BSE 
control measures as equivalent to that of New Zealand. This 
would eliminate individual product approval procedures 
initiated following the BSE detection in the United States. A 
country assessment review by the Ministry of Agriculture 
(MAF) is under way which would permit a reinstatement of New 
Zealand,s Import Health Standard (IHS) for U.S. live cattle 
and a resumption of trade. 
 
Table Grapes. The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture (MAF) 
in September 2002 issued a new IHS for the import of table 
grapes from California that effectively reopened trade to 
U.S. exporters. The IHS contained specific mitigation 
measures to address the detection of post-border, black widow 
and other exotic spiders. As of December 2004, no significant 
biosecurity breaches were reported to the New Zealand 
government following the resumption of trade. The United 
States requested a modification of these mitigation measures 
to reduce costs to U.S. exporters and New Zealand importers 
without compromising New Zealand,s biosecurity standards. 
MAF responded by reducing the table grape inspection levels 
for the 2004 shipping season, but mandatory cold treatment 
remains in force. As of early December 2004, MAF had not 
responded to USDA documentation supporting the elimination of 
the unwarranted cold treatment of California grapes. 
 
Pork Meat. In June 2002, New Zealand modified its regulations 
imposed a year earlier requiring pork meat products imported 
from countries with porcine reproductive and respiratory 
syndrome (PRRS), including the United States, to be cooked to 
a certain temperature, either before export or after import 
in special facilities in New Zealand. The cooking requirement 
results in a darker meat color, which tends to be negatively 
received by consumers. New Zealand revised its import 
regulations in 2003, allowing pig meat products from the 
United States to be microwave treated. MAF again modified its 
import regulations for U.S. pork meat in November 2004, this 
time allowing entry of pork meat products derived from pigs 
imported live into the United States from Canada for 
immediate slaughter. Prior to this, New Zealand,s IHS had 
allowed entry only of U.S. pork meat derived from U.S. 
resident animals or from pigs resident and slaughtered in 
Canada and further processed in the United States.  The 
Ministry of Agriculture remains willing to consider 
scientific evidence related to the PRRS issue that would 
justify a review of its import health standard for pork meat. 
 
Poultry Meat. New Zealand implemented measures that suspended 
the importation of poultry meat from various nations, 
including the United States, in late 2001 because of the risk 
of introducing infectious bursal disease (IBD). U.S. 
exporters are unable to sell uncooked poultry meat to New 
Zealand, while cooked poultry meat is restricted to canned 
products. Discussions between the United States and New 
Zealand on this issue continue. 
 
Soybean meal. New Zealand,s import regulations for oilseed 
meals were modified in May 2004, requiring an official 
phytosanitary certification to address certain manufacturing 
practices. USDA does not monitor or inspect U.S. production 
facilities for soybean meal and was unable to meet New 
Zealand,s new certification requirements. Following 
consultations with USDA, MAF again amended its IHS for 
oilseed meals in August 2004 and November 2004. These 
revisions allow an independent verification authority in 
conjunction with a manufacturer,s certificate to address the 
production process issue and, taken together with USDA 
documentation, meet New Zealand,s import requirements. The 
new import regulations establish clarity and certainty 
regarding certification of U.S. soybean meal and allowed 
normal sales and supplies to resume. 
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION 
 
In October 2003, the New Zealand Parliament enacted a ban on 
the parallel importation of films, videos and DVDs for the 
initial nine months after a film\'s international release. 
The ban applies only to film media, not to parallel 
importation of music, software and books.  It is scheduled to 
sunset in 2008, unless extended. 
 
The new legislation, which amended the Copyright Act 1994, 
also makes it easier to challenge copyright violations in 
court by shifting the burden of proof in certain copyright 
infringement cases to the defendant, who must prove that an 
imported film, sound recording or computer software is not a 
pirated copy. 
 
By omitting a ban on parallel imports of music, software and 
books, however, the legislation failed to roll back all the 
provisions of the New Zealand government\'s 1998 amendment to 
the Copyright Act.  While the legislation addressed many of 
the U.S. film industry\'s concerns about parallel importing, 
other U.S. industries, particularly producers and 
distributors of music and software, have voiced concerns that 
allowing parallel imports makes it more difficult to detect 
and combat piracy and erodes the value of their products in 
New Zealand and in third-country markets. 
 
The music industry also is concerned about a proposed 
amendment to the Copyright Act that would legalize the 
duplication of sound recordings in other formats for a 
purchaser\'s private use.  The government says this would 
enable consumers to employ new digital technologies and would 
legalize what already is common practice.  The music industry 
warns that such an exception to copyright protection would 
make copyright infringement difficult to police, send the 
wrong message to consumers and cost the industry an estimated 
$13.7 million in sales revenue and $1.97 million in profits 
per year. 
 
With amendments proposed in June 2003 to the Copyright Act 
1994, the government aims to bring New Zealand law into 
closer conformity with the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and 
the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT).  The 
amendments are intended to reflect developments in digital 
technologies and international developments in copyright law 
and are expected to be introduced in 2005.  If this 
legislation is enacted, the New Zealand government will 
determine whether to accede to the WCT and WPPT treaties. 
 
New Zealand also took a number of actions to strengthen its 
IPR enforcement regime.  To deter counterfeiting and 
copyright piracy, the Trade Marks Act 2002, which entered 
into force in August 2003, creates new criminal offenses for 
counterfeiting trademarks and increases the penalties for 
pirating copyright goods.  For those offenses, the act 
provides for penalties of up to NZ $150,000 (US $97,065) in 
fines or up to five years\' imprisonment. 
 
Following a government review of the Patents Act 1953 that 
began in August 2000, the Ministry of Economic Development 
has drafted legislation intended to bring the act into closer 
conformity with international standards.  The draft would 
keep the maximum patent term at 20 years, but would tighten 
the criteria for granting a patent, from a patentable 
invention being new in New Zealand, to being new anywhere in 
the world and involving an inventive step. 
 
The draft\'s prohibition of patents for methods of medical 
treatment concerns some pharmaceutical companies.  The 
industry also is concerned by the Cabinet\'s decision in 
mid-2004 to halt a study on the economic impact of extending 
patent terms for pharmaceuticals.  In a submission to the New 
Zealand government, the pharmaceutical industry group, 
Researched Medicines Industry Association of New Zealand, had 
contended that New Zealand\'s effective patent life for 
pharmaceuticals had been substantially eroded.  It 
recommended adoption of a supplementary protection 
certificate arrangement, similar to those used in a number of 
OECD and European Union countries.  This would effectively 
extend patent protection.  However, the draft legislation 
fails to address this issue. 
 
The pharmaceutical industry also is troubled by an amendment, 
enacted in December 2002, to the Patents Act 1953.  The 
amendment provided that it is not a patent infringement for a 
person to make, use, exercise or vend an invention for 
purposes related to gaining regulatory approval in New 
Zealand or other countries.  It effectively expedites the 
approval process for generic competition to products going 
off patent.  The amendment was passed quickly and not as part 
of the ongoing and thorough review of the Patents Act.  The 
pharmaceutical industry is strongly opposed to this 
\"springboarding\" legislation. 
 
The United States continues to monitor developments in IPR 
issues closely. 
 
SERVICES BARRIERS 
 
Local Content Quotas 
 
Radio and television broadcasters have adopted voluntary 
local content targets, but only after the New Zealand 
government made it clear that it would otherwise pursue 
mandatory quotas.  While New Zealand government officials 
have said they are sensitive to the implications of quotas 
under the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), 
they reserve the right to impose them. 
 
Telecommunications 
 
U.S. industry has expressed concern about the cost of 
completing calls onto mobile networks in New Zealand, which 
ranks among the highest in the world for this charge.  The 
New Zealand regulating authority began an investigation in 
May 2004 into mobile termination rates and in an October 2004 
draft decision said that mobile network operators had been 
able to set unreasonably high rates because of limited 
competition in the market.  The authority called for such 
charges to be regulated.  Its final recommendation, expected 
in early 2005, may or may not retain the draft decision\'s 
recommendations.  The final decision rests with the 
Communications Minister, who can accept the regulating 
authority\'s recommendation, reject it or refer it back for 
further consideration.   The final decision is expected in 
late 2005. 
 
Competitors of the formerly state-owned monopoly Telecom were 
disappointed by the New Zealand government\'s decision in May 
2004 against unbundling the local loop.  Although under 
competitive pressure, Telecom still dominates the market. 
The Communications Minister accepted the regulator\'s 
recommendation against ordering Telecom to open its national 
fixed-line network to competitors.  Saying he aimed to 
increase competition in broadband services, the Minister also 
agreed with the regulator\'s recommendation to require 
bitstream unbundling, or access to Telecom\'s equipment by 
service providers in order to sell their own broadband 
services, and to accept Telecom\'s offer to provide within six 
months unbundled partial private circuits, primarily used for 
business data services.  As of the end of 2004, however, 
Telecom and regulators had yet to agree on commercial terms 
and conditions for the unbundled bitstream service. 
INVESTMENT BARRIERS 
Investment Screening 
New Zealand screens certain types of foreign investment 
through the Overseas Investment Commission (OIC).  Amid a 
growing public outcry about foreigners buying coastal 
properties, the New Zealand government in November 2003 
launched a review of OIC\'s powers.  That review led to 
proposed legislation, introduced in November 2004, that would 
raise the minimum threshold for scrutiny of proposed business 
purchases, but toughen the screening and monitoring of land 
purchases.  Under the legislation, the threshold for 
screening non-land business assets would be increased from NZ 
$50 million (US $35.7 million) to NZ $100 million (US $71.3 
million), where a foreigner proposes to take control of 25 
percent or more of a business.  Government approval still 
would be required for purchases of land over 5 hectares 
(12.35 acres) and land in certain sensitive or protected 
areas.  For land purchases, foreigners who do not intend to 
live in New Zealand would have to provide a management 
proposal covering any historic, heritage, conservation or 
public access matters and any economic development planned. 
That proposal would have to be approved and generally made a 
condition of consent.  In addition, investors would be 
required to report regularly on their compliance with the 
terms of the consent.  Overseas persons would continue to 
have to demonstrate the necessary experience to manage the 
investment.  Any application involving land in any form still 
would have to meet a national interest test.  The United 
States has raised concerns about the continued use of this 
screening mechanism.  New Zealand\'s commitments under the 
GATS Agreement of the WTO are limited as a result of New 
Zealand\'s screening program. 
 
OTHER BARRIERS 
 
Pharmaceuticals 
 
The U.S. Government continued to raise concerns about New 
Zealand\'s pharmaceutical sector policies, which do not 
appropriately value innovation and diminish the contribution 
of New Zealand to research and development of innovative 
pharmaceutical products. New Zealand\'s Pharmaceutical 
Management Agency (PHARMAC) administers a Pharmaceutical 
Schedule that lists medicines subsidized by the New Zealand 
government and the reimbursement paid for each pharmaceutical 
under the national health care system.  The schedule also 
specifies conditions for prescribing a product listed for 
reimbursement.  PHARMAC, a stand-alone Crown entity 
structured as a statutory corporation, accounts for 73 
percent of expenditures on prescription drugs in New Zealand. 
 
New Zealand does not directly restrict the sale of 
non-subsidized pharmaceuticals in the country.  However, 
private medical insurance companies will not cover 
non-subsidized medicines, and doctors are often reluctant to 
prescribe non-subsidized medicines for their patients, who 
would have to pay out-of-pocket costs.  Thus, PHARMAC\'s 
Pharmaceutical Schedule decisions determine the selection and 
pricing of the bulk of pharmaceutical drugs sold in New 
Zealand.  Its decisions have a major impact on the 
availability and price of non-subsidized medicines and the 
ability of pharmaceutical companies to sell their products in 
the New Zealand market. 
 
The United States has serious concerns relating to the 
transparency, predictability and accountability of PHARMAC\'s 
operations.  U.S. pharmaceutical suppliers report that the 
methodology used to determine Pharmaceutical Schedule 
decisions lacks transparency.  The Boards of PHARMAC and the 
Researched Medicines Industry Association of New Zealand have 
been meeting to discuss these concerns.  The U.S. Government 
will continue to closely monitor developments in this sector. 
 
On December 10, 2003, the New Zealand and Australian 
governments signed a treaty to create a joint agency to 
regulate medical devices, prescription and over-the-counter 
medicines, dietary and nutritional supplements, and cosmetics 
such as sun creams.  Aside from prescription pharmaceuticals, 
New Zealand does not currently regulate market entry of these 
products.   TThe new agency is scheduled to begin operations 
July 1, 2005.  Each country\'s government will continue to 
determine funding of prescription medicines.   The new agency 
may charge full cost-recovery fees to register products and 
require additional documentation and assessments for certain 
products, even if they already have U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration approval.  U.S. manufacturers and distributors 
of non-pharmaceutical therapeutic products have expressed 
concerns that those requirements would be overly burdensome 
and costly and serve to discourage exports of their products 
from the United States to New Zealand.

b.  (SBU) The U.S. Mission in New Zealand currently rates the 
threat from transnational and indigenous terrorism as low. 
There are no terrorist groups or support groups believed to 
be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In light of the 
worldwide security alert all visitors should heighten their 
security awareness and report any unusual incidents to the 
Regional Security Officer. 
 
c.  (SBU) Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat 
mail have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions in 
New Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, 
various groups in New Zealand have demonstrated occasionally 
at the Embassy in Wellington and at the Consulate in 
Auckland.  These demonstrations are usually small and are 
peacefully conducted.  During these demonstrations, the host 
country police and protective services normally provide 
adequate protection to the Embassy and Consulate. 
 
d.  (SBU) New Zealand is considered a medium threat crime 
environment.  As such, Wellington and Auckland have 
experienced an increase in violent and petty crimes, but they 
are usually non-confrontational in nature.  However, home 
invasion robberies and assaults, once very rare, are becoming 
more frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur countrywide but 
primarily in the large cities of Auckland, Christchurch and 
Wellington, and visitors should be especially aware that 
street crime, such as scams and pickpockets is a daily 
occurrence in these cities.  Common sense precautions should 
be taken, especially at night, to avoid becoming a target of 
opportunity. 
 
e.  (SBU) Generally, New Zealand does not play a significant 
role in the world drug situation; however, evidence indicates 
that New Zealand has been utilized as a transit point for 
shipments of Ecstasy, Heroin and Cocaine to Australia.  The 
most abused drugs in New Zealand are locally produced 
methamphetamine and cannabis.  There have been increased 
amounts of lab seizures and violent crime associated with 
groups attempting to control this market. 
 
f.  (U) All forms of public transportation are generally safe 
at all times of the day; however, at night visitors should 
use common sense precautions so as to not become a target of 
opportunity. 
g.  (U) The traffic situation in Auckland can be difficult 
with a moderate amount of congestion.  Wellington and 
Christchurch traffic is significantly better; however, during 
rush hour moderate delays can be expected.  Visitors are 
advised that traffic drives on the left-hand side of the 
road.  Visitors are advised that traffic accidents are common 
and that it is safe to pull over so that police may take an 
accident report.  However, visitors who experience hostility 
or anti-American sentiment should depart the scene 
immediately and notify the RSO. 
 
h.  (U) Precautions should also be taken to not discuss 
sensitive or classified information outside secure 
environments or over unsecured and/or cellular telephones, 
and to securely safeguard classified or sensitive information 
at the Chancery and not at hotels or residences. 
 
i.  (U) Visitors should also be aware of the State 
Department\'s Consular Information sheet for New Zealand and 
the most recent Worldwide Caution Public Announcements, which 
are available via the Internet at http://travel.state.gov 
 
j.  (U) In essence, visitors to New Zealand must exercise 
appropriate caution and be alert to their surroundings with 
regard to their personal security.  Suspicious 
incidents/activities should be reported to RSO Wellington 
(Telephone (64)(4)462-6000, 24 hours/day).

SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND SUPPORT TO TSUNAMI RELIEF VICTIMS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 959 
 
1.  (U) NZAid has confirmed to post the break down of the NZD 
10 million (about USD 7.2 million) that the New Zealand 
Government has committed so far to the relief effort: 
 
 -- Up to NZD 5 million will be given in dollar-for-dollar 
matching funds for private charitable donations (FYI: The Red 
Cross here has announced donations to their organization 
alone so far total $3.2 million; they expect the total to 
increase to $8 million.  So we can expect the government will 
likely pay out the full $5 million.) 
 
-- NZD 3 million (USD 2.16) will go to the UN Aceh appeal. 
 
-- NZD 2 million will be provided for general relief efforts. 
 This includes NZD 300,000 to provide funding for a New 
Zealand company operating helicopters in Borneo to conduct 
relief operations, including reconnaissance, liaison, and 
light transport.  It also includes a police forensic team 
helping to identify bodies in Phuket. 
 
2.  (U) Many New Zealand officials remain on leave this 
holiday break, and those whom post contacted were unable to 
tell us whether or not the NZD 10 million includes the funds 
used to support NZ Defense Force (NZDF) tsunami relief 
efforts.  As of now, there are two C-130 Hercules in the 
region, airlifting relief supplies and personnel to the 
affected areas and evacuating refugees out.  One C-130 
arrived in Sumatra on January 2 with a 30-member NZDF medical 
team that is working with Indonesian authorities and 
alongside an Australian Defence Force Health Support Company. 
The other was deployed on December 28, and as of December 31 
had delivered 25 tons of supplies before suffering a crack in 
its manifold. After repairs, it delivered a water 
purification plant into Aceh province.  A RNZAF Being 757 has 
been in the region since December 31, carrying Police and 
Defense personnel to help with victim identification. 
 
3.  (U) As of today, there have been two confirmed New 
Zealand deaths in the Phuket region and one in Sri Lanka. 
The government remains \"gravely concerned\" about 17 other New 
Zealanders, seven  whom were thought to have been in 
Thailand, four in Sri Lanka, four in India, and one in the 
Andaman Islands.  According to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade, a total of 737 New Zealanders remain 
unaccounted for overall. 
 
4.  (SBU) Although none of the confirmed or feared New 
Zealand casualties have been in Indonesia, that is where the 
bulk of NZ assistance has been directed.  This apparently 
reflects the government\'s assessment of where the need is 
greatest, as well as the fact that the military aircraft 
being used to deliver assistance can most easily reach 
Indonesia from New Zealand and Australia.

SUBJECT: INDUSTRY MAY FOOT BILL FOR COST OF BOOSTING NEW 
ZEALAND\'S OIL RESERVES 
 
REF: 04 WELLINGTON 291 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified -- protect accordingly.  Not 
for Internet distribution. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Oil companies are facing the prospect of 
shouldering the costly burden of bringing New Zealand\'s oil 
stocks up to an international standard.  With the country\'s 
reserves well below the 90-day supply recommended by the 
International Energy Agency (IEA), New Zealand\'s Cabinet has 
decided to impose the expense of expanded oil stockpiles on 
the four major oil companies and one independent company 
operating in New Zealand.  The companies say that if the 
government wants to meet the IEA standard, then it should 
bear the cost.  In addition, they contend that if the 
government allowed the market to work, oil supplies would be 
adequate.  The government will accept comments until February 
2 on a study it commissioned on the matter and then is 
expected to decide how it directs the stockpiling of oil. 
The two U.S. companies have not yet requested U.S. government 
advocacy of their position, but have asked that post continue 
to monitor the issue.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) While New Zealand depends on imports for about 80 
percent of its oil consumption, the government does not hold 
any reserves or require oil companies to maintain stockpiles. 
 However, New Zealand relies on industry stockpiles to meet 
its obligation as a member of the IEA to hold 90 days of oil 
reserves.  With the country now holding less than 60 days\' 
supply, it must arrange storage of about 500,000 additional 
tons of oil to meet the IEA target, according to the 
government-commissioned study released December 14.  The 
study was launched in October after the government learned of 
New Zealand\'s shortfall, which was caused by inaccurate 
accounting of stockpiles and declining domestic production. 
 
3. (U) The report estimates the cost of building storage 
tanks and acquiring the extra oil to meet the IEA target 
would be NZ $640 million (US $448 million) in 2006. 
Inventories would have to be increased about 62 percent and 
capital investment raised about 26 percent.  In a statement 
accompanying the study, then Minister of Energy Hodgson said, 
\"Cabinet has decided that oil companies should be responsible 
for providing adequate stocks, not the taxpayer.\"  (In an 
unrelated Cabinet reshuffle December 20, Trevor Mallard was 
named energy minister.)  The study expects the industry would 
pass the added costs to end-users, but this would raise pump 
prices no more than NZ 1 cent per liter. 
 
4. (SBU) Oil companies disputed the cost estimates, 
contending that the industry and ultimately consumers would 
pay more.  Mobil Oil New Zealand estimates the expense to 
each large oil company would be NZ $100 million to NZ $150 
million, which would increase Mobil\'s working capital 
requirements in New Zealand by 25 to 50 percent.  Caltex New 
Zealand said the estimates do not include the cost of land 
for new storage tanks and maintenance.  Two other large oil 
companies, BP New Zealand and Shell New Zealand, and an 
independent company, Gull, operate in the country. 
 
5. (SBU) Peter Thornbury, public affairs manager for Mobil 
Oil New Zealand, said the government confused the issue of 
security of supply with meeting the IEA target.  As the study 
noted, the oil companies in the country have operated on 
\"sound commercial lines,\" maintaining reserves that have not 
compromised supply to their customers.  Peter Doolan, 
president of the ExxonMobil Refining and Supply Division in 
Singapore, said that if the government wants additional 
stockpiles, it -- and not private industry -- should fund 
them. 
 
6. (SBU) Separately, John Kerr, public affairs manager of 
Caltex New Zealand, said the government\'s desire to meet the 
IEA target is based on a \"societal\" assessment of the level 
of adequate reserves, rather than on a commercial view of the 
possibility of disrupted oil supplies.  Kerr asserted that an 
interruption of oil supplies from the Middle East over a long 
period of time -- the study\'s key scenario -- is unlikely. 
 
7. (SBU) New Zealand is unique among IEA members in being 
heavily dependent on distant imports, Thornbury and Kerr 
noted.  A long supply chain -- between 25 to 30 days from 
Middle East suppliers and between 15 to 20 days from Far East 
suppliers -- means that in-transit oil supplies might be 
considered as reserves.  They suggested the government seek 
the IEA\'s concurrence to count stocks in transit toward the 
reserves requirement.  This would enable New Zealand to 
satisfy the 90-day target without constructing additional 
storage.  The study, however, takes the opposite view: The 
long supply chain increases New Zealand\'s vulnerability to 
oil shortages.  The four major companies import mostly crude 
petroleum that must be processed at New Zealand\'s sole 
refinery.  Gull imports refined products. 
 
8. (SBU) The study also cites the need for official oversight 
of storage levels, for monitoring compliance and for 
implementing a penalties regime.  Companies expressed a 
wariness of increased regulation of their industry. 
 
9. (U) Minister Hodgson described the required 90-day reserve 
as a \"sensible precaution.\"  He called on the government to 
consider even larger stockpiles, allowing New Zealand to draw 
from them rather than having to restrict demand during a 
supply disruption.  The study did not analyze the benefits of 
membership in the IEA, which New Zealand joined in 1976. 
 
10. (SBU) Comment: Despite the expected rise in gas prices -- 
which already went up 12 percent in September over the past 
year -- a decision to boost oil stockpiles is not a 
politically difficult one for the government in this election 
year.  It is the oil industry that likely will take the blame 
for a price bump caused by plumping the oil reserves. 
Directing oil stockpiling also would be consistent with the 
government\'s increasing intervention in the energy sector. 
This effort, sparked by its desire to ensure adequate energy 
supplies, has in the past year included re-regulating the 
electricity sector, instituting incentives for gas 
exploration and entering a risk-sharing agreement with a 
state-owned enterprise to get a new power project off the 
ground.

SUBJECT: SENTENCING IN NEW ZEALAND\'S LARGEST PASSPORT FRAUD 
CASE 
 
REF: 04 WELLINGTON 911 
 
1. (U) Following their conviction for conspiring to commit 
forgery in October (reftel), refugees to New Zealand Iraqi 
Fahad Jaber AJEIL and his brother-in-law, Kuwaiti Riyad 
Hamied SULTAN, were sentenced December 20 in the Auckland 
District Court.  Ajeil, who had been found guilty on 14 
forgery-related charges, received a five-year prison term, 
and Sultan, guilty of only one conspiracy charge, was 
sentenced to two years in prison.  The Crown Prosecutor had 
asked for eight years for Ajeil and three to four years for 
Sultan.  (Note: Ajeil\'s conviction for possession of 
implements of forgery, for example, carries a maximum jail 
term of ten years.) 
 
2. (U) While this case has been described as the largest of 
its type in New Zealand, in handing down the sentences Judge 
Nicola Mathers expressed doubt as to how and when the forged 
documents were to have been used - whether for use in acts of 
terrorism or, as the defense lawyer alleged, to provide 
temporary residence documents to stateless Bedouins in 
Kuwait.  While she noted the seriousness of the crimes, 
Mathers then stated that the offenses were not at \"the top 
end of the scale.\"  In handing down the sentence, Mathers 
referenced the role played by Kuwaiti Dr. Abu-Shaaban, who 
the defense maintained was the ringleader of the operation, 
and who was charged with conspiracy in absentia.  She noted 
that the NZ Police\'s inability to speak with Dr. Abu-Shaaban 
was a matter of concern.

9.  (U) The Cook Islands is a Parliamentary democracy in 
free association with New Zealand, on which they rely for 
defense and assistance in meeting low-level security 
threats.  The Embassy is not aware of any specific threats 
to U.S. facilities or personnel at this time in the Cook 
Islands.  However, in light of the worldwide security 
alert all visitors should heighten their security 
awareness and report any unusual incidents to the Regional 
Security Office at the Embassy in Wellington, New Zealand. 
 
10.  (U) Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist 
attacks in the U.S. and the November 2002 terrorist 
bombing in Bali, there has been concern that terrorists 
might seek to take advantage of the low level of security 
maintained in small island states such as the Cook Islands 
in order to target tourists in previously safe 
destinations.  New Zealand has worked with the Cook 
Islands to improve airport security in response to this 
possibility.  Terrorist actions may include, but are not 
limited to, suicide operations, bombings, or kidnapping. 
Possible threats include conventional weapons such as 
explosive devices or non-conventional weapons, including 
chemical or biological agents.  Terrorists do not 
distinguish between official and civilian targets. 
Targets may include facilities where Americans and other 
foreigners congregate or visit, such as residential areas, 
clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels, 
outdoor recreation events, resorts, and beaches.  U.S. 
citizens should increase their security awareness at such 
locations, avoid them, or switch to other locations where 
Americans in large numbers generally do not congregate. 
11.  (U) The Cook Islands offshore finance industry has 
come under scrutiny regarding possible money laundering. 
The Cook Islands has been included on the OECD\'s list of 
non-cooperating states in the fight against money 
laundering. 
 
12.  (U) As a result of recent military action in Iraq, 
there is a potential for retaliatory actions to be taken 
against U.S. citizens and interest throughout the world. 
Public demonstrations carry the potential for 
precipitating violence directed at American citizens. 
 
13.  (U) U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a 
heightened state of alert and some have drawn down their 
dependents and/or personnel.  These facilities may 
temporarily close or suspend public services from time to 
time for security reasons.  In those instances, U.S. 
embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide 
emergency services to American citizens.  Monitor the 
local news and maintain contact with the nearest American 
Embassy or U.S. Consulate. 
 
14.  (U) Crime:  Appropriate common sense precautions 
should be taken, especially at night, to avoid becoming a
