REF: 03 LILONGWE 1202 
 
1. (U) On January 1, First Vice President Justin Malewezi 
announced that December 31, 2003 was his last day in office 
and that he has resigned as First Deputy National Chairman of 
the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF).  In his press 
release, Malewezi said he made the decision for personal 
reasons and will comment more fully on his future plans in 
two weeks, after he has \"had time to reflect on (his) 
options.\"  Apart from confirming receipt of Malewezi\'s 
resignation, neither the Office of the President and Cabinet 
(OPC) nor the UDF have commented.  (NOTE: Malewezi officially 
still encumbers the vice presidency.  He is taking leave 
until his mandate ends with the May 2004 elections.) 
 
2. (U) The OPC, however, did announce that UDF 2004 vice 
presidential candidate Cassim Chilumpha will take up 
Malewezi\'s secondary position of Minister of Privatization. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (SBU) Malewezi\'s resignation from the UDF is a serious 
blow to the party and to its chances of winning the May 
presidential elections.  He is widely regarded as among the 
most capable, hard-working, and honest of UDF leaders, and he 
has taken lead roles in HIV/AIDS, food security, and 
privatization.  He was criticized by party stalwarts for not 
being supportive enough of a third term for President Muluzi, 
and his relations with the President have been lukewarm ever 
since.  When Muluzi hand-picked outsider Bingu wa Mutharika 
as his successor in March, the rupture was complete. 
Although Malewezi has been marginalized in the government 
over the past year, he nevertheless offered it a measure of 
credibility.  His abrupt resignation has exacerbated party 
disarray, and has led to speculation about other high-level 
defections.  The big question now is what Malewezi will do 
next -- throw his support to an opposition candidate or 
consider a presidential run of his own.  END COMMENT.

Summary 
------- 
1.  (C) Presidential Economic Advisor Goodall Gondwe 
reportedly met with the Treasury Department in Washington in 
December to make a pitch for waivers on Malawi\'s IMF 
commitments.  Contrary to his message, we assess that a lack 
of political will has caused the GOM\'s persistently missed 
fiscal and structural commitments (reftels).  Moreover, there 
are signs that performance on key conditions is 
deteriorating.  With elections coming in May 2004, we believe 
that messages sent now about the importance of political will 
and follow-through will determine donor-GOM relations for 
years to come.  Given current performance, we recommend that 
waivers not be granted, particularly on structural 
conditions.  End summary. 
 
Mr. Gondwe Goes to Washington 
----------------------------- 
2.  (SBU) In mid-December, we alerted Washington that GOM 
officials might use planned negotiations at World Bank 
headquarters to make a pitch for waivers to its IMF program 
conditions (ref D).  It has come to our attention that 
Presidential Economic Advisor Goodall Gondwe did exactly that 
on December 22, approaching the Treasury Department with an 
appeal for support ahead of a potential February review. 
 
3.  (SBU) Gondwe reportedly argued that IMF engagement is 
especially necessary ahead of upcoming May elections, that 
fiscal slippages are largely the result of IMF 
miscalculations and delays in donor disbursements, and that 
the GOM is making significant progress on missed structural 
conditions.  We disagree. 
 
GOM Performance on Fiscal, Monetary Conditions 
--------------------------------------------- - 
4.  (SBU) Without arguing the details of the GOM\'s likely 
failure to meet its most recent fiscal conditions (refs A, B, 
and C), we note that the GOM has been a serial breaker of its 
fiscal pledges since the inception of its Poverty Reduction 
and Growth Facility (PRGF) in December 2000.  It was a lack 
of fiscal discipline that drove Malawi\'s PRGF off track in 
2001, and, while the IMF\'s underestimation of domestic 
interest payments will undoubtedly contribute to current 
expenditure overruns, the pattern of broken promises remains. 
 
5.  (SBU) In addition, we note that President Muluzi used the 
resumption of IMF disbursements in October to announce new 
spending initiatives (ref B), and that shortly after 
Christmas he announced that Malawi\'s 120,000 civil servants 
would receive an immediate raise along with a second raise in 
June or July.  There is confusion over whether and how the 
raise might be implemented and its potential fiscal impact is 
unknown, not least because a contact in the Ministry of 
Finance has told us the President\'s announcement caught the 
Ministry\'s budget division by surprise.  The Secretary of the 
Treasurer has also stated that the raise has not been 
contemplated in the revised budget, soon to be presented. 
The program, however, would clearly run contrary to the GOM\'s 
fiscal commitments to the IMF. 
 
Old, New Issues on Structural Conditions 
---------------------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) We continue to see lack of political will within 
the GOM to adhere to its structural conditions under the 
PRGF.  Two missed conditions, in particular, have come to be 
considered by several key donors as measures of the 
government\'s commitment to reform: 1) a requirement that an 
amendment to the Corrupt Practices Act be submitted to 
Parliament to allow the Anti-Corruption Bureau to prosecute 
cases without prior approval from the politically appointed 
Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP); and 2) a requirement 
that a complete audit of domestic arrears be conducted. 
Substantial progress has been made on neither. 
 
7.  (SBU) On the anti-corruption amendment, the GOM has 
advanced the weak argument that the legislation was not 
introduced to Parliament (as had been promised only weeks 
before the session) because checks and balances are needed to 
prevent politically-motivated prosecutions.  What, then, we 
have asked our interlocutors, is the judicial branch for? 
The issue of anti-corruption in Malawi is not about checks 
and balances.  It is about the GOM\'s credibility, which is 
now extremely low, as the prosecutions of several Cabinet and 
senior ruling party members have been quietly blocked under 
the current legislative formulation (ref D).  As one 
Anti-Corruption Bureau official recently told the Embassy, 
\"The only time we get to act is when a Minister involved 
falls out of government.\"  As noted in ref D, in four weeks 
of Parliament in November and December (and a special one-day 
session convened on December 30), the GOM refused to let the 
anti-corruption legislation be brought to the floor for 
debate. 
 
8.  (SBU) GOM performance on the arrears audit has involved 
similar foot-dragging.  Though first introduced as a 
requirement of the EU\'s bilateral program in 2001, the 
audit\'s most recent deadline was completion by December 2003. 
 According to the local EU office, which will fund the audit, 
the contract -- as prepared by the EU in July 2003 -- may (if 
all goes well) be signed this week. 
 
9.  (SBU) Even if the audit contract is signed, our EU 
contact stated that the audit may not proceed, because there 
are indications that the GOM may have changed the audit 
contract\'s terms of reference since the EU completed the 
tender process in July 2003.  If those terms have changed 
significantly in the six months the GOM has spent signing the 
contract with KPMG, the EU will be required to re-tender the 
contract by its own transparency regulations, delaying the 
audit\'s start again.  The EU is having an internal discussion 
about holding back bilateral support tied to the audit until 
the actual auditing has begun, he stated. 
 
10.  (SBU) Asked for his assessment of the GOM\'s intentions 
on the contract, our EU interlocutor stated that it was 
originally thought that the delays were the result of 
incompetence and mismanagement.  Now, however, he stated 
that, \"personally,\" he believed they were \"just buying time.\" 
 \"We all expect arrears to be a problem...perhaps in the 
billions of kwacha.\" 
 
Analysis and Recommendation 
--------------------------- 
11.  (C) Just as on fiscal matters, the GOM\'s performance on 
structural criteria has been lacking and shows signs of going 
in the wrong direction.  A third (not yet much talked about) 
structural condition, for the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to 
release a report on potential corruption involving the 
National Food Reserve Agency, was due at the end of December 
and apparently needs to be added to the list of missed 
conditions.  The Attorney General is reportedly implicated, 
and one ACB official openly worried to us that the report 
will be buried.  Moreover, the Deputy Director of the ACB\'s 
contract has not been renewed.  When the ACB gets aggressive 
with politicians, our contact continued on to say, \"they come 
back and fire us.\"  GOM credibility on its anti-corruption 
efforts -- and by extension its performance on structural 
reform -- deteriorates all the while. 
 
12.  (C) It is worthwhile to note that Goodall Gondwe, the 
GOM\'s emissary to the Treasury Department, encumbers an 
advisory position that is funded through a World Bank 
program.  The purpose of his position is to get President 
Muluzi world-class economic analysis to support performance 
on Bank and Fund programs.  A Malawian, Gondwe formerly 
worked as the Deputy Director for the Africa Division at the 
IMF (where the current IMF team leader for Malawi was a 
subordinate) and he appears to be skillfully working his 
contacts at the Fund to the GOM\'s advantage.  His messages 
should be filtered with care: he has stakes with more than 
one player in this exchange, and he may be angling for a 
senior administration appointment after May\'s elections. 
Shortly after his December message to the Ambassador on the 
proposed anti-corruption amendment (ref D), we learned that 
Gondwe had not coordinated with the Attorney General, who had 
control of the legislation, and that the \"GOM\" opinion he 
presented was fragmented among senior administration members. 
 
13.  (C) Gondwe was right about one thing: now is a critical 
juncture for Malawi.  May\'s elections will usher in a new 
administration, and the messages the IMF sends today about 
the necessity to follow through on commitments will set the 
tone for donor-GOM relations for years to come. The governing 
elite in Malawi is very small, and today\'s and tomorrow\'s 
bureaucrats and politicians are drawing lessons from this 
episode.  We believe that medium- to long-term Malawian 
performance -- on a range of bilateral and multilateral 
issues -- hinges on the country\'s leadership learning to take 
responsibility for itself.  Given current GOM performance, we 
therefore advise against granting waivers for repeated broken 
promises, particularly on structural conditions.

REF: A. 03 LILONGWE 449 
 
     B. 03 LILONGWE 938 
 
1. (SBU) Malawi Congress Party (MCP) vice president Gwanda 
Chakuamba resigned from the leading opposition party and 
formed the Republican Party on January 8.  After a shaky 
seven-month marriage of convenience with MCP president and 
personal nemesis John Tembo (ref B), Chakuamba announced his 
departure was a result of \"public demands\" that he form a 
party of his own.  Tembo, apparently surprised by Chakuamba\'s 
decision, has not yet publicly commented. 
 
2. (U) Chakuamba\'s defection came 10 days after former MCP 
treasurer Hetherwick Ntaba left the MCP to form his own 
party, New Congress for Democracy (NCD).  Ntaba, who is 
interim president of the party, told a press conference on 
December 28 that he formed the party because of political 
difficulties he was facing with the MCP\'s leadership.  (NOTE: 
The once faithful confidant of Tembo, Ntaba has had 
difficulties in the MCP since he attempted to run for the 
party\'s presidency at the April 2003 convention per ref A. 
Recently Ntaba, who has been accused of collusion with the 
ruling United Democratic Front and President Muluzi, was 
suspended from the MCP\'s National Executive Committee.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (SBU)  Ntaba is popular among a very small group of urban 
technocrats in the MCP, most of whom are unlikely to leave 
the patronage system and prestige of an established party. 
His departure will have little real effect on the MCP, and 
his only chances for continued political influence are 
through a coalition with other opposition parties or, if 
rumors be true, through further collusion with the UDF and 
Muluzi.  Chakuamba, on the other hand, has controlled a 
faction of roughly half of the MCP membership.  His 
departure, while not surprising, will mean major electoral 
and party recalculations for the MCP.  Without Chakuamba\'s 
support (and that of his followers), the MCP is no longer the 
leading opposition party; it is simply an opposition party 
among many others. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED.  With the elections four months 
away, the next couple of weeks will be decisive in forming 
the opposition ballot.  It remains plausible that a 
Kenya-like situation occurs where the majority of the 
opposition parties coalesce to field a single presidential 
candidate and to share parliamentary seats -- which 
opposition parties contend will happen.  With a February 25 
deadline on nomination of presidential candidates, serious 
negotiation (along with serious compromises) will have to 
occur rather quickly among the various opposition party 
leaders.  However, considering the opposition\'s previous 
failures to work together, a Zambia-like scenario is also 
possible with divisions among numerous opposition parties 
allowing the ruling UDF to maintain power with a fairly low 
percentage of votes.  END COMMENT.

1. Following continued power outages, The Electricity Supply 
Corporation of Malawi Limited (ESCOM) announced on January 5 
that the recent onset of seasonal rains has caused an 
increase in the amount of biotrash (primarily in the form of 
aquatic weeds and silt) on the Shire River, which has 
\"severely hampered\" power generation at ESCOM\'s hydroelectric 
facilities.  ESCOM predicts that the current power outages 
will continue through the end of the rainy season 
(mid-April), as nearly all of the nation\'s power is produced 
in hydroelectric facilities.  In some areas, the power 
outages have hindered the day-to-day operations of businesses 
and basic service providers, such as the local water boards. 
(NOTE: Without power, the local water boards have been unable 
to provide clean water to some urban areas.) 
 
2. As reported reftel C, an accident precipitated by aquatic 
weeds in March 2003 crippled power production and led to 
electricity rationing for several months.  Fearing a similar 
occurrence, the Consumers Association of Malawi has planned a 
march on January 16 to deliver to ESCOM and the Blantyre 
Water Board (BWB) a petition demanding quick resolution of 
the current problems and preventative measure be put in place. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3.  ESCOM\'s continued and predictable problems with aquatic 
weeds hinder economic development and threaten urban 
sanitation.  Post sees OES\'s pending Integrated Management of 
the Lake Malawi/Niasa/Nyasa Basin as an opportune means of 
finding a sustainable solution to this critical situation, 
while also promoting general cooperation and coordination 
among the three nations bordering the lake.

SUBJECT: FOOD SITUATION IN MALAWI INCREASINGLY WORRYING 
 
 
1. Summary. Poor rainfall, coupled with maize price 
volatility, is raising concerns that there may be a 
new food security crisis in Malawi this year.  The 
Government of Malawi (GOM) has stated that it may need 
to declare a disaster within the next three months if 
harvest prospects do not improve.  The international 
community is closely monitoring the situation and 
developing contingency plans should a crisis emerge. 
However, at this time it is too early to predict the 
likely outcome of this year\'s harvest or determine the 
possible extent of food insecurity later in 2004.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------ 
POOR CLIMATIC CONDITIONS 
------------------------ 
2. Rainfall in Malawi has been unevenly distributed and 
sporadic in many areas during the 2003-2004 rainy 
season.  Particular areas of concern include portions 
of southern Malawi (Nsanje and Chikwawa Districts, 
southwestern parts of Thyolo, Mulanje, and Phalombe 
Districts).  Parts of Northern Malawi (Rumphi and 
Karonga Districts) have also had poor rains to-date. 
Should rains not improve within the coming days, FEWS 
plans to issue a food security alert for Malawi. 
 
------------------------- 
CROP PRODUCTION PROSPECTS 
------------------------- 
3. Informal reporting on planting varies, but in general 
most farmers have planted their crops for the 2003-04 
planting season.  Should the rains not improve, 
it is feared that yields will fall sharply.  In 
Malawi, even slightly below normal maize harvests 
have been sufficient to trigger a humanitarian crisis, as 
in 2001-3. 
 
4. The responsibility for producing crop estimates was 
transferred this year from the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Irrigation, and Food Security (MOAIFS) to 
the National Statistics Office (NSO).  This transfer 
has hurt the Government of Malawi\'s ability to 
accurately forecast production.  Due to insufficient 
personnel and resources, the NSO was not able to 
release the first round of crop estimates in early 
January as is usually the case.  Given the NSO\'s lack 
of experience with the crop forecasting process, it is 
expected that the data produced will be of poorer 
quality and exhibit greater unreliability than 
previous figures. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
DISINCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE SECTOR MAIZE TRADE 
-------------------------------------------- 
5. As is the norm during the lean season in Malawi 
(December-March), consumer maize prices are rising 
in local markets.  According to FEWS, maize prices 
ranged from 9.72 MK/kg to 16.67 MK/kg through mid- 
December.  The price of maize sold at ADMARC depots 
remains 10 MK/kg. 
 
6. The unusually low price of maize (well below the 
current world market price) sold through ADMARC is of 
increasing concern to the international community. 
Anecdotal evidence suggests that private traders are 
exporting Malawian maize to neighboring countries 
where maize prices are more favorable.  There are also 
no incentives to import maize into Malawi given 
current government price distortions. 
 
7. The GOM currently has 73,706 MT of maize in the 
Strategic Grain Reserve.  However, the GOM has very 
limited capacity to draw down maize from its silos. 
Only an estimated 400 MT per day can be released from 
silos.  Given this constraint, the GOM has been unable 
to pre-position maize to be ready should the rains 
impede access to certain depots.  Isolated cases of 
stockouts in ADMARC depots to date have resulted in 
immediate maize price increases in local markets. 
Should this problem become widespread, many Malawians 
will not be able to afford to purchase sufficient food 
for their families.  (Comment: ADMARC\'s continued role in the 
commercial maize market in Malawi is exacerbating 
maize price volatility and food insecurity. End comment.) 
 
---------------------- 
NUTRITIONAL SITUATION 
---------------------- 
8. Informal reporting suggests that acute malnutrition is 
rising in isolated areas, particularly in southern 
Malawi and rural Lilongwe District.  Relief 
organizations have conducted rapid Middle Upper-Arm 
Circumference (MUAC) screening in their areas of 
operation.  UNICEF and the MOH are compiling the 
results in order to identify target areas for 
additional nutritional monitoring.  In anticipation of 
a potential rise in malnutrition during the hunger 
season, the USAID-funded C-SAFE program has a 
contingency plan for supplementary feeding. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER DECLARATION GROWING 
------------------------------------------ 
9. The undesirable mix of chronic vulnerability, poor 
harvest prospects, volatile maize prices, and reduced 
availability of maize (due to government-created 
disincentives affecting importers) could culminate in 
a renewed food emergency in Malawi this year. 
However, while concern is mounting, it is too early to 
accurately predict the situation.  More information should 
be available by the end of January/early February. 
USAID also plants to conduct an assessment of the situation 
in Nsanje District in early February.  In addition, at the 
urging of USAID/Malawi and other donors, WFP and NGOs 
are consistently monitoring and reporting on 
developments in their areas of operation and plan to 
do a fuller assessment in the coming weeks. 
 
10. In the January 16 edition of the daily \"Nation,\" 
Malawi\'s President Bakili Muluzi is quoted as saying: 
\" If the situation continues like this for the next 
three months, I will declare a state of disaster so that 
donor organizations can come in to help us.\" 
(Comment: Press reports that some 3.5 million 
Malawians may be at risk of starvation are premature. 
There have been no known assessments to back up this 
figure, or to differentiate between chronic food 
shortages and abnormal levels of acute food 
insecurity.  However, post anticipates that food 
security may well become a hot political topic given 
the elections slated for May of this year.  End 
comment.) 
 
--------------------------- 
ONGOING USG FOOD ASSISTANCE 
--------------------------- 
 
11. The USG continues to support Malawi with food 
assistance through its contributions to WFP\'s regional 
emergency operation in southern Africa as well as the 
ongoing C-SAFE program.  In addition, the USDA is 
providing some $4 million in food assistance for WFP\'s 
school feeding program this year.  WFP and C-SAFE 
partners continue to collaborate closely and are 
prepared to quickly return to emergency operations if 
needed. 
 
12. Post is closely monitoring the situation and will 
continue to report at it evolves.

Classified By: Pol/Econ Officer Marc Dillard for reasons 1.5 b/d. 
 
1.  (C) Minister of Commerce and Industry Sam Mpasu told the 
Ambassador during a January 27 meeting that he had been 
\"bowled over\" by reftel letter from USTR Zoellick and that he 
was \"very excited\" by its prospects.  Before the letter, he 
stated, \"We had developed a perception that the developed 
countries did not want us to have a significant slice of 
world trade... We left Cancun thinking there was no hope.\" 
 
2.  (C)  Describing Cancun, Mpasu stated that he had found 
Pascal Lamy\'s negotiating posture \"arrogant.\"  He expressed 
the hope that the EU would \"take a cue\" from the U.S., adding 
that the GOM would like to see major breakthroughs in WTO 
negotiations before Hong Kong. 
 
3.  (C) Mpasu somewhat identified Malawi with the G-20 group, 
stating that \"we\" have \"a funny set-up, not a permanent 
coalition,\" and he distanced Malawi from some of the group\'s 
thinking, particularly on sugar.  On the Singapore issues, he 
rhetorically asked why developing countries should talk about 
them when their concern is agriculture, and he pointedly 
stated that, given its direction, \"we were better off with a 
failed Cancun.\" 
 
4.  (C) Comment: Mpasu was enthusiastic about another chance 
for the WTO, but he has an economic nationalist streak and is 
not yet a convert to U.S. thinking.  He will assess any new 
WTO negotiations by what they offer in terms of reduced 
developed-world agricultural subsidies, reduced non-tariff 
barriers for agricultural goods, and technical assistance 
offered to least-developed countries.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) Republican Party (RP) President Gwanda Chakuamba and 
People\'s Progressive Movement (PPM) President Aleke Banda 
were elected presidential candidate and running mate of the 
7-party opposition alliance known as the \"Mgwirizano 
Coalition\" on February 13.  Political activists had hoped to 
create a Kenya-style \"grand coalition\" alternative to the 
ruling United Democratic Front (UDF), but rivalries have kept 
the opposition\'s two most influential parties -- Brown 
Mpinganjira\'s National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and John 
Tembo\'s Malawi Congress Party (MCP) -- out of the alliance\'s 
ranks.  Without the NDA and MCP, the Mgwirizano Coalition is 
a conglomeration of minor parties with a few major political 
figures (including Vice President Justin Malewezi).  Weak 
grassroots support, a lack of institutional structures, and 
poor geographical coverage limit the Coalition\'s chances for 
success in the May elections.  In its current form, its most 
likely role will be to split the opposition\'s vote.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
SOMETHING OF A COALITION IS BORN 
-------------------------------- 
2. (U) After weeks of clergy-led discussions, the Republican 
Party (RP), Movement for Genuine Democratic Change (MGODE), 
People\'s Progressive Movement (PPM), National Unity Party 
(NUP), Malawi Forum For Unity and Development (MAFUNDE), 
People\'s Transformation Party (PETRA), and Malawi Democratic 
Party (MDP) signed an MOU on January 23 to contest May 18\'s 
general elections as the \"Migwirizano Coalition.\"  On 
February 13, the Coalition selected a presidential candidate 
and running mate by rating nominees from each party on 
pre-selected criteria.  Winning the most votes, RP President 
Gwanda Chakuamba became the presidential candidate and PPM 
President Aleke Banda took his side as running mate. 
 
3. (SBU) Taking part in the talks, but notably absent from 
the MOU, were the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and National 
Democratic Alliance (NDA).  Publicly, the MCP and NDA have 
cited various reasons for not joining the Coalition, 
including concerns over the method by which the presidential 
candidate and running mate were chosen and worries over the 
long-term viability of the Coalition, which has done little 
work so far in harmonizing its consituents\' platforms or in 
post-election planning.  (Comment: It is clear, however, that 
behind-the-scenes wrangles over who would lead any coalition 
have been a major stumbling block, with both the MCP and NDA 
holding out for the top positions.) 
 
...BUT WILL IT HOLD? 
-------------------- 
4. (U) Despite the signing of the MOU, the Coalition remains 
tenuous.  A faction of MGODE, led by Greenwell Mwamondwe and 
Sam Kandodo Banda, reportedly left a Coaltion candidate 
selection meeting to protest the absence of the NDA and MCP. 
A fissure has reportedly developed in the party over 
continued support to the Coalition, and newspaper accounts 
have claimed similar internal frictions surfacing within PPM. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (SBU) The Mgwirizano Coalition has none of the unity or 
strength opposition activists hoped it would.  In its current 
form, it is little more than a conglomeration of minor 
parties -- most of which are not represented in Parliament. 
While the names of Chakuamba, Banda, and Malewezi lend the 
Coalition political credibility, they do little to extend its 
power base. 
 
6. (SBU) Time is running out on hopes for a grand opposition 
alliance.  While the MCP or NDA might still come to some 
accommodation with the Coalition, the Malawi Electoral 
Commission\'s February 25 deadline for the formal announcement 
of presidential candidates is fast approaching.  And if the 
NDA, MCP, and the Coalition all put forward their own 
candidates (as appears likely), the opposition will be badly 
split -- much to the advantage of the ruling United 
Democratic Front.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE VOTER REGISTRATION 
 
REF: LILONGWE 1202 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) Although the Malawi Electoral Commission\'s (MEC) 
inadequate preparations led to logistical difficulties during 
voter registration, we judge the exercise to have been 
generally acceptable, despite shortages of materials at many 
registration centers.  The MEC has reported that 900,000 new 
voters registered and 2 million verified their prior 
registrations during the exercise.  Mission observers visited 
over 200 registration centers in one-fourth of Malawi\'s 
parliamentary districts.  We generally found registration 
centers to be well-organized and run by competent staffs, 
though they lacked forms and film necessary to complete the 
range of registration activities.  Logistical difficulties 
and known problems with the current voter rolls will have to 
be addressed by the MEC to ensure that May\'s polls run 
smoothly.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE MEC\'S NUMBERS 
----------------- 
2. (U) At the end of the voter registration exercise (January 
5-28), which was twice-extended because of low voter turnout 
and a lack of materials, the MEC reported that 900,000 new 
voters registered and 2 million verified their information. 
In addition, 78,000 deceased voters were removed from the 
rolls.  Commenting on the registration logistics, the MEC 
acknowledged that many centers did not have adequate 
replacement voter cards for voters who had lost their cards 
or enough film to take photos of new voters.  The MEC 
supplied centers with additional forms and film in the latter 
half of the registration period to deal with most of these 
complaints.  They have also announced that the centers will 
re-open for one week in April to encourage more voter 
verifications and new registrations.  (NOTE: Voter cards are 
not required to vote.) 
 
3. (SBU) The MEC has acknowledged to the donor community that 
there remain some issues with the voter rolls that need to be 
addressed prior to the election.  Although the MEC estimates 
the total number of legal registered voters to be 5.8 
million, the voter rolls currently exceed more than 6 
million, and so the MEC plans to \"clean up\" the rolls in 
April by removing double registrants and deceased persons and 
by processing transfers.  (COMMENT: Our estimations point to 
the need for a more involved clean-up.  With a population of 
11.6 million and a median age of 16.4 years, we roughly 
calculate that there can be no more than 5.1 million people 
who could legally register to vote.  And with roughly 260,000 
people dying per annum in Malawi, the current roll could have 
as many as 790,000 deceased voters on it, given that the 
rolls were last cleaned in 2000. END COMMENT.) 
 
WHAT WE OBSERVED 
---------------- 
4. (SBU) Over the 23-day period, the Mission sent out 
observers to over 200 registration centers in 45 
parliamentary districts.  Reports from US Mission observers 
-- similar to those of other missions -- indicate that the 
registration centers were largely well-organized and run by 
competent staffs.  Political parties and local NGOs monitors 
were in the centers and appeared to understand their role to 
scrutinize the process. 
 
5. (SBU) Observers did however note the inadequate supply of 
registration forms and film and the overall low participation 
of voters.  In addition, observers noted frustration amongst 
registration officials about unclear guidelines and 
impractical procedures for transferring a voter\'s 
registration from one constituency to another.  Finding most 
registration centers in order, US Mission observers judged 4% 
of the centers visited to have \"serious problems\" that would 
likely \"affect the overall integrity of the registration 
process,\" and the problems were uniformly related to the 
inadequate supply of materials. 
 
THE LOCAL RESPONSE 
------------------ 
6. (U) Midway through the exercise, local NGOs began 
releasing press statements evaluating the registration 
exercise.  Most of the statements noted the lack of 
materials, the low voter turnout, and the MEC\'s slow response 
to problems at registration centers.  A few organizations 
also commented on specific incidents related to poorly 
organized centers or to political party rallies disrupting 
registration activities.  To address these concerns, the MEC 
extended the original 14-day registration period by 9 days. 
Some NGOs and political parties have also expressed their 
concern about the MEC\'s ability to handle polling day 
logistics. 
 
7. (U) The donor community (including the US, the UK, the EU, 
UNDP, Norway, and Germany) also released a press statement on 
the registration process.  The statement included the above 
mentioned observations and counseled the MEC to intensify its 
efforts to deal with the registration exercise\'s shortcomings 
and to prepare more adequately for polling day. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (SBU) Recognizing the MEC\'s logistical difficulties and 
inadequate preparations for the registration process, we find 
the overall process to have been generally acceptable. 
Throughout the process, the MEC made genuine efforts to 
replenish form and film supplies and to address other 
concerns as they became apparent.  That being said, the MEC 
still faces the task of cleaning up the voter rolls and 
improving its performance for the actual polls.  Since the 
vote is a one-day exercise, the MEC will have to ensure an 
adequate number of ballots and iron out the administrative 
glitches that dogged registration if it does not want to 
compromise the polling exercise on May 18.

1. (C) Rwandan refugees in Malawi are reportedly eager to

administrator on February 19 at the camp, who said that many 
Rwandan refugees have been asking about returning home, and 
frustration with delays is increasing at the camp. He said 
there are currently at least 15 families prepared to return 
immediately to Rwanda, with many more interested in departing 
soon. The administrator stated that new Rwandan refugees are 
being registered, they often demand to know how soon they 
will be able to return home.

Burundian and Rwandan origin. (COMMENT: This is contrary to 
UNHCR resident representative\'s recent estimate of 13,000 per

refugee conditions were reportedly better, but have since 
returned. 
 
3. (SBU) WFP\'s deputy country director told poloff on 
February 19 that Rwandan refugees are in fact leaving Malawi, 
but not in a swift and organized manner; one month\'s estimate 
was 150 departures, and another\'s was zero. She said that 
refugee departures are still not being documented to WFP\'s

SUBJECT: STATE/AID JOINT STRATEGIC PLAN: AMBASSADOR\'S 
ALL-STAFF REVIEW 
 
1.  SUMMARY. On February 12, Ambassador Browning conducted a 
meeting to introduce and review the new State/AID Joint 
Strategic Plan.  The concept behind this plan, how it will be 
implemented, and what the expected results will be were 
presented to American and locally engaged staff of both 
agencies.  The Ambassador and the USAID Mission Director 
highlighted the already strong cooperation between USAID and 
State in Malawi, and expressed their expectation that the 
formal alignment of foreign policy goals will benefit all 
involved. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  In his opening remarks, the Ambassador described the 
initiative as an opportunity to better define the U.S. 
foreign policy mission, help to set priorities, and clarify 
common goals.  He suggested that significant administrative 
and management changes will be the aspect of this initiative 
first noticed at overseas posts. He emphasized joint 
State/USAID training and employee exchanges, a unified 
communications and messaging system, and joint management of 
planning and resources as resulting improvements. The DCM 
added that vis-a-vis the Mission\'s key MPP program goals of 
strengthening democracy, economic development, and an 
improved health situation, the joint strategic plan increases 
the Mission\'s ability to accomplish objectives. 
 
3.  The USAID director noted that the new joint strategy 
reflects the role of USAID as a foreign policy agency. 
Because a strong relationship already exists in Malawi, the 
USAID director commented that the joint strategy puts the 
development goals of the USG in greater relief but will not 
significantly affect program activity in the country. 
USAID\'s deputy director added that the collaboration with the 
embassy and the support of the Ambassador in USAID\'s 
Triennial Review was noted in USAID/Washington as an example 
of how the common goals are meant to be operationalized. In 
the same fashion, USAID participated closely with the embassy 
in preparing the MPP. To illustrate the strong USAID 
endorsement of the Joint Strategic Plan and to address some 
questions raised by USAID staff, the concluding ten minutes 
of the recent USAID \"all hands meeting\" with Administrator 
Natsios was shown. 
 
4.  Staff were given the opportunity to ask questions about 
the plan, its implementation, and effects. Concerns regarding 
wholesale merging of the two agencies were raised, as were 
concerns about the impact on staffing levels in certain 
fields. The Ambassador stated that although he was confident 
a complete merger unlikely and unnecessary, there may be some 
staffing ramifications as management efficiencies are 
identified. If we can successfully accomplish the same goals 
as two agencies, he observed, the appearance of a need for a 
combined agency will be diminished. He added that an 
important objective of any government agency is responding to 
the needs of taxpayers; streamlining and right-sizing make it 
easier to determine accomplishments. 
 
5.  We understand that the Joint Management Council has 
established functional working groups to prepare 
implementation plans, and we look forward to learning about 
them and implementing their recommendations on the post 
level. We believe that the Strategic Plan will benefit the 
work both of State and of USAID in the field.

1.  With May 2004 presidential and parliamentary 
elections approaching, state-owned radio and television 
persists in almost exclusively broadcasting ruling party 
campaigning and pro-government news.  Neither the 
Electoral Commission nor the Malawi Communications 
Regulatory Authority is willing to take any action to 
ensure balanced coverage.  Unequal access to public media 
for the opposition during the run-up to the elections 
clearly jeopardizes Malawi\'s chances of holding free and 
fair elections. 
 
2.  Members of the donor community (UK, EU, Germany, 
France, Norway, UNDP and the U.S.) issued a joint 
statement on January 30 calling on the Information 
Ministry and Boards of Directors of state-owned Malawi 
Broadcasting Corporation and Television Malawi to ensure 
equitable coverage of all political parties.  Minister of 
Information Bernard Chisale dismissed donor concerns and 
insisted that the opposition would receive coverage of 
their events if they informed reporters of their 
functions and provided them transportation (as does the 
ruling party).  This argument, however, is specious in 
that much of the reporting is not live and journalists 
often do not actually attend functions they report about. 
 
3.  Comment.  Post has been producing a monthly overview 
of state radio news, highlighting partisan coverage.  The 
reports have made the pro-government bias at state media 
crystal clear to a wide readership, including government 
officials, donors, and private media.  There is almost no 
positive coverage of opposition news or opposition 
campaigning, and little prospect that the situation will 
change at least until the beginning of the \"official\" 
campaign period in late March.  End comment.

SUBJECT: POLICE OPEN FIRE AT OPPOSITION POLITICAL RALLY; 
TWO INJURED 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) At a February 22 political rally of the opposition 
Mgwirizano Coalition, police fired on the crowd, injuring two 
people.  The rally, which the police claimed could not take 
place because the President was holding his own rally in the 
vicinity, resumed later after Coalition leaders obtained a 
court injunction.  The two victims have reportedly been 
treated and released from the hospital, and no AmCits are 
known to have been injured.  Shenanigans with rally permits 
and the police\'s heavy-handed crowd control methods appear to 
be part of a pattern of UDF attempts to undermine and prevent 
opposition parties from holding public meetings. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) Kholiwe Mkandawire, Spokesperson for the Coalition, 
told polfsn that the Coalition had requested and received 
permission to hold a rally at Njamba Freedom Park in Blantyre 
on February 22.  However, just before the rally was to begin, 
the police delivered a handwritten letter from the Blantyre 
City Assembly Chief Executive barring the rally from taking 
place.  According to Mkandawire, the letter said the rally 
had to be canceled because the President was holding a ruling 
United Democratic Front (UDF) rally 7 kilometers away from 
Njamba Freedom Park.  In attempts to disperse the crowd of 
thousands, the police reportedly fired several rounds of tear 
gas and blank bullets before changing to live ammunition. 
 
3. (U) Two people were reportedly shot.  The hospital 
administration told polfsn that the two gunshot victims were 
treated yesterday.  In stable condition, both patients have 
been released from the hospital.  To post\'s knowledge, no 
AmCits were injured. 
 
4. (SBU) Amid the confusion, the police tried to dismantle 
the speaker\'s platform, which the Coalition had paid the City 
Assembly approximately USD 50 to construct.  Coalition 
leaders, however, sought and received a court injunction 
allowing the rally to take place.  Later in the afternoon, on 
a partially dismantled platform, Coalition presidential 
candidate Gwanda Chakuamba addressed the remaining supporters. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (SBU) Malawian police have a history of heavy-handed crowd 
control, and it is almost exclusively wielded against 
opposition rallies and demonstrations.  President Muluzi\'s 
decision to hold a simultaneous UDF rally in the vicinity of 
the Coalition\'s was reportedly a last-minute development. 
This was no coincidence, and we see a pattern appearing where 
the ruling UDF prevents opposition parties from holding 
public meetings through manipulating rally permits (mainly by 
re-scheduling its own rallies wherever and whenever the 
opposition plans to meet) and by heavy-handed police tactics. 
 The police-inspired violence at the Mgwirizano Coalition\'s 
first major rally are signs of rising political tensions and 
an increasingly polarized society, and it bodes ill for the 
prospects of a peaceful campaign leading to the May 18 
elections.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT GETS PERSONAL ABOUT AIDS AT LAUNCH OF 
NATIONAL POLICY 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Officer Peter W. Lord, reasons 1.5 (b/d). 
 
1. (SBU) At the February 10 launch of the National AIDS 
Policy, President Muluzi made the surprise announcement that 
one of his brothers had died three years ago as a result of 
AIDS.  In the address attended by UNAIDS Executive Director 
Dr. Peter Piot, Muluzi also declared he knows his HIV status 
is negative because he has gone for voluntary testing.  While 
acknowledging that the prevalence rate has stabilized between 
14 and 15 percent, Muluzi encouraged Malawians to go for 
voluntary counseling and testing (VCT).  With only 3 percent 
of the population having visited a testing center, Muluzi 
advocated VCT as the way to go \"if the fight against the 
epidemic is to be successful.\" 
 
2. (U) Supported by USAID-funded POLICY project, the National 
AIDS Policy that was launched by Muluzi in Blantyre on 
February 10 aims to provide comprehensive guidance on 
prevention, treatment, care, support, and the multi-sectoral 
response to the spread of HIV/AIDS.  The policy has a 
particular focus on human rights and empowerment as the 
primary means for fighting the pandemic at the village level. 
 As a result, protection against marital rape and provisions 
for gender equity in the family, equal access to treatment 
and information, protection of prisoners against violence and 
abuse, and equal treatment of the disabled are all included. 
The policy also contains several controversial provisions, 
such as allowing children age 13 and older to seek VCT 
without parental consent, authorizing health-providers to 
disclose the status of an infected individual to a spouse, 
and approving the provision of condoms in prisons.  The 
Cabinet officially adopted the policy in November 2003. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (C) While the President\'s announcement about AIDS in his 
family was laudable, it has been too long in coming.  In a 
country so clearly affected by HIV/AIDS, Muluzi has had (and 
missed) many opportunities to deal with the pandemic in a 
personal and practical way.  The GOM has had countless 
high-level officials and parliamentarians whose deaths have 
gone unremarked, even as the daily business of government has 
been compromised by AIDS-related absences and deaths.  While 
Muluzi has routinely included HIV/AIDS messages in almost all 
of his speeches for several years, this marks the first 
occasion that he has personalized the issue. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: The need for Muluzi (and other 
senior officials) to move directly and personally to address 
HIV/AIDS was made all too apparent at the February 10 launch. 
 When Muluzi announced he had voluntarily been tested for 
HIV, both the Ministers of Health and Commerce (who were 
seated behind the Ambassador) audibly giggled.  END COMMENT.

FORMALIZED 
 
 
1. (U) Hours before signing a ruling United Democratic Front 
(UDF) and Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) MOU to jointly 
contest May\'s elections, President Muluzi dissolved the 
Cabinet on February 23.  No reason was given for the 
dissolution, and the Office of President and Cabinet (OPC) 
has requested that all matters requiring ministerial 
attention be addressed to the State House. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
2. (SBU) Considering the many concessions AFORD is making by 
signing the MOU (supporting both UDF\'s presidential candidate 
and running mate, and fielding candidates in only 38 of 193 
parliamentary districts), it is possible that Muluzi 
dissolved the Cabinet as a gesture of good faith to AFORD. 
With a signed MOU in hand, we would not be surprised if 
Muluzi\'s next Cabinet has several new AFORD faces.  In 
handing out new Cabinet assignments, Muluzi will also have 
the opportunity to remove UDF ministers whose support for the 
party has not been hard-line enough.  END COMMENT.

Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU) Malawi\'s AGOA exports (excluding GSP) continued to 
grow in 2003, and now exceed $58 million.  More than $20 
million of those exports are clothing, and a fifth garment 
company began operations.  Privatization and reorganization 
of Malawi\'s primary textile manufacturer may extend the AGOA 
supply chain down through Malawi\'s cotton ginners to cotton 
growers, spreading AGOA\'s benefits to more Malawians.  The 
GOM\'s weak fiscal performance, deteriorating perceptions 
about anti-corruption efforts, and approaching 2004 
elections have led to some uncertainty for investors. 
Additional regional assistance for local exporters to comply 
with U.S. sanitary and phyto-sanitary regulations would 
remove a potential irritant in the trade relationship.  End 
Summary. 
 
AGOA Trade and Investment 
------------------------- 
2.  (U) Most new economic activity in Malawi that has 
occurred under AGOA has been in the textile and apparel 
sector.  Malawi was approved for AGOA textile and apparel 
benefits in August 2001.  Two Taiwanese-owned firms, HAPS 
Investments and Chirimba Garments, immediately began 
exporting under AGOA once Malawi was approved.  Currently, 
five companies -- HAPS, Chirimba, Crown Fashions (local), 
and Giant Clothing (South African), and Knitwear Industries 
(local) -- are approved under the AGOA visa system. 
 
3.  (U) The fifth company, Knitwear Industries, started its 
AGOA exports during 2003.  With its operations, the number 
of jobs tied to AGOA producers grew slightly in 2003, with 
the five companies now employing approximately 7,500 
workers.  (Note: Managers are reporting more variety in 
their export contracts, making it difficult to label 
particular positions \"AGOA jobs.\") 
 
4.  (U) A further positive development in 2003 was the 
privatization of David Whitehead and Sons (DWS), Malawi\'s 
primary textile producer.  Mismanagement at DWS had kept it 
from supplying textiles to Malawi\'s garment-makers and had 
led to fears that the expiration of the \"third country 
fabric\" provision of AGOA would leave garment-makers without 
a ready source of AGOA-eligible (and competitively priced) 
fabrics. 
 
5.  (SBU) Comment: Embassy is pleased to note that Knitwear 
Industries\'s AGOA exports and the privatization of DWS.  The 
owner of Knitwear Industries is Chairman of Malawi\'s Garment 
and Textile Manufacturers\' Association, and he has been a 
key partner of the Embassy\'s in advancing AGOA.  DWS\'s 
privatization has been an Embassy goal since 2001, and it is 
hoped that its revitalization under new ownership will link 
garment-makers to Malawi\'s cotton growing and ginning 
sectors, deepening Malawi\'s AGOA supply chain, and spreading 
AGOA\'s economic benefits to more Malawians.  End Comment. 
 
Market Economy/Economic Reform/Trade Barrier Elimination 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
6.  (U) The GOM has made a basic commitment to the 
principles of market economies.  It encourages both domestic 
and foreign investment in most sectors of the economy, 
without restrictions on ownership, size of investment, 
source of funds, and destination of final product.  The 
Competition and Fair Trading Act -- passed in November 1998 
and made operational in April 2000 -- aims to regulate and 
monitor monopolies and the concentration of economic power, 
protect consumer welfare, and strengthen the efficient 
production and distribution of goods and services.  Although 
basic structures are in place, weak government fiscal 
performance has hampered growth and continues to create 
excessively high interest rates. 
 
7.  (U) The government continued to make progress in 2003 
with its multi-sector privatization program, under which it 
has sold off 61 of approximately 110 targeted companies 
since 1996.  Completed privatizations in 2003 included the 
Cold Storage Company, Grain and Milling, and the 
aforementioned David Whitehead and Sons.  On-going 
privatizations include Malawi Telecommunications Limited and 
Air Malawi. 
 
Rule of Law/Political Pluralism/Anti-Corruption 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
8.  (U) Malawi\'s fledgling democracy has produced elections 
in 1994 and 1999 declared substantially free and fair by the 
international community.  Its third presidential and 
parliamentary elections are scheduled for May 2004.  Some 
inter- and intra-party violence has occurred in the run-up 
to the elections, and opposition access to state-owned media 
will be a key question in assessing the election\'s fairness. 
 
9.  (U) Malawi\'s Constitution guarantees basic freedoms and 
respect for civil liberties, including freedom of speech, 
religion, and assembly.  Malawi has a fairly independent but 
overburdened judiciary, which derives its procedures from 
English Common Law.  The judiciary demonstrated its 
independence in 2003, putting injunctions in place against 
several parliamentary actions deemed illegal. 
 
10.  (U) The GOM\'s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has actively 
pursued public and private corruption.  The ACB, however, 
has not been successful in prosecuting high-profile cases, 
and the Government has blocked attempts to give the ACB more 
prosecutorial independence.  This has led to a deterioration 
in perceptions of corruption in Malawi. 
 
Poverty Reduction 
----------------- 
11.  (U) Since 1981, Malawi has undertaken economic 
structural adjustment programs supported by the World Bank 
(IBRD), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other 
donors.  Malawi reached the decision point for its Highly 
Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt relief program in December 
2000 and has since developed its Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Paper, which was launched in 2002.  While Malawi continues 
to work with these institutions and to use the Poverty 
Reduction Strategy as the central planning document for 
government budgeting, a lack of fiscal discipline has led to 
weak growth and macroeconomic instability, limiting overall 
poverty reduction. 
 
Labor/Child Labor/Human Rights 
------------------------------ 
12.  (U) Malawi\'s labor laws cover the majority of the ILO\'s 
core labor standards.  However, a lack of resources hampers 
government enforcement and tripartite cooperation. 
 
13.  (U) On child labor, Malawi\'s Constitution and 
employment laws comply with the Minimum Age Convention (ILO 
138), and the Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention (ILO 
182), but resource constraints -- both human and financial - 
- hamper enforcement.  A 2000 Malawi Demographic and Health 
Survey estimated that 9% of Malawian children aged 5-14 were 
working for non-relatives, about two-thirds without pay, and 
that 27% of Malawian children were either working for a non- 
relative (paid or unpaid) or doing more than four hours of 
household chores per day. 
 
14.  (U) During 2003, the public-private Child Labor Task 
Force has continued to expand its membership among labor, 
private sector, and NGO organizations.  The Task Force\'s 
2003 initiatives have included lobbying the Ministry of 
Labor to develop an action plan specifically devoted to 
curbing child labor.  The Ministry agreed, and it increased 
its personnel to include desk officers for child labor 
issues. 
 
15.  (U) Embassy is unaware of any GOM activities that 1) 
undermine the foreign policy or national security interests 
of the United States, 2) engage in gross violations of human 
rights, or 3) provide support for international terrorism. 
 
AGOA Outreach/Technical Assistance 
---------------------------------- 
16.  (U) The following are examples of outreach or technical 
assistance projects that have occurred in Malawi in the past 
year: 
 
--The Mission solicited and then supported visits from 
regional APHIS and USAID representatives to provide 
technical assistance and outreach on pest risk assessments 
and more general sanitary and phyto-sanitary issues. 
 
--The Public Affairs Section programmed the regional APHIS 
representative to speak to students at the Bunda College of 
Agriculture on agricultural opportunities under AGOA. 
 
--The Public Affairs Section continued a campaign to promote 
AGOA awareness.  This included print interviews with the 
Ambassador and Econ/Commerical Officer, public speakers, and 
a radio call-in show featuring Embassy personnel. 
 
--The Mission, in conjunction with the regional USAID hub, 
provided technical assistance to Malawians interested in 
exporting under AGOA\'s Article 9 provisions on hand-crafted 
items. 
 
--The Mission sent the CEO of Malawi\'s Confederated Chambers 
of Commerce and Industry on an International Visitor program 
covering U.S.-Africa economic ties.  The visitor, who has 
been active in promoting AGOA through various GOM task 
forces, participated in the annual AGOA forum as part of his 
I.V. program. 
 
Trade Capacity Building Needs 
----------------------------- 
17.  (SBU) The Mission continues to advocate that Malawian 
exporters think beyond garments and textiles, and the 
natural avenue for Malawi should be agricultural exports. 
As noted by other posts in the region, difficulties in 
dealing with U.S. sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements 
are starting to be perceived as a deliberate non-tariff 
barrier to trade.  Greater regional resources devoted to 
helping countries understand and comply with U.S. 
regulations would both reduce this misperception and broaden 
AGOA\'s local beneficiaries.

SUBJECT: MULUZI TWEAKS CABINET BEFORE ELECTIONS 
 
REF: A. LILONGWE 149 
 
     B. 03 LILONGWE 1202 
 
1. (U) After dissolving his 45-member Cabinet two days 
earlier, President Muluzi appointed a largely unchanged 
Cabinet on February 24.  Amid the re-shuffle, what changes 
were made reflect the ruling United Democratic Front\'s (UDF) 
tweakings to position the party for May\'s elections. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
2. (SBU) Other than sidetracking a government already 
distracted by the May elections, the changes Muluzi made to 
the Cabinet will have little effect on our dealings with the 
GOM, as most of the key ministers have remained the same.  It 
appears Muluzi was merely tweaking his Cabinet to prepare for 
the May elections.  All but one of the people dropped from 
Cabinet lost primaries in their parliamentary districts, and 
many of the newly appointed members come from key opposition 
areas.  For example, Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Charles 
Kasunda is the MP from estranged Vice President Justin 
Malewezi\'s parliamentary district, and Minister of State for 
Statutory Corporations Rapheal Mhone is from the same 
district as Mgwirizano Coalition running mate (and former UDF 
stalwart) Aleke Banda.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BIOTECH OUTREACH: MALAWI REQUEST 
 
REF: State 15050 
 
1.  Summary.  In 2002 Malawi enacted a Biosafety Act, 
which created a framework for regulating biotechnology. 
Necessary regulatory structures and guidelines have not 
followed, however, and implementation remains weak.  The 
arrival of USG food aid in 2002 and 2003 raised safety 
and environmental concerns among some members of the 
public, the NGO community, and some in Government.  Given 
Malawi\'s recurrent food crises, including another 
possible shortage this year, advancing USG policy on 
biotech is a Mission priority. Post therefore requests 
$48,000 in funding for an outreach program. End summary. 
 
2.  Goals: 
 
     The Mission outreach program targets two groups: 
the policy makers and the consumers.  The Public Affairs 
Section has already held several lectures and an AFNET on 
biotech issues, and the Malawi public has expressed 
interest in learning more.  Malawian scientists are 
largely pro-biotech and understand the scientific issues. 
Policy makers need educating, however, and so does the 
public.  Rumors of infertility and illness due to biotech 
maize persist.  There have also been reports in the press 
that biotech maize is unsafe to eat and is brought to 
Malawi from the U.S. as a dumping ground, and that 
biotech maize is only eaten by cattle in the US. 
 
3.  PAS has already started a partnership with the Malawi 
Human Rights Youth Network (MHRYN), targeting civil 
society with the message that biotech maize is safe to 
eat.  MHRYN is well-placed to reach out to NGOs and other 
human rights groups. Together, we have mounted a national 
civic education awareness campaign for civil society 
organizations, government officials, agriculture 
extension workers, farmers and consumers of biotech 
maize, but lack funding to reach a broad audience.  For 
this message to be best delivered, a baseline survey of 
beliefs and concerns would help focus our outreach 
strategy. 
 
4.  Malawi also needs information on biotech at the 
technical and policy levels.  Policy makers need to 
develop implementation tools for the biotech policy. 
Malawi scientists must decide what the biotech investment 
priorities are so that the biotech agenda can be driven 
by Malawians.  Malawi policy makers need to understand 
that biotech is a tool for fighting hunger.  Biotech food 
must have appropriate regulations, needs to be grown in 
an environmentally safe manner, and should not endanger 
Malawi\'s trading status with other countries. 
 
5.  Audiences and strategies: 
 
     The Public Affairs Section and the committee chaired 
by MHRYN propose a multi-faceted public diplomacy 
campaign targeting a variety of audiences. 
 
     a)   Policy makers and academics: Invite an U.S. Speaker 
        and Malawian scientists to spend one week with the 
        appropriate Ministry of Agriculture officials to develop 
        guidelines and structures for the biotech policy. 
        Utilize examples of approved biotech legislation and 
        develop a framework for implementing existing 
        legislation.  The U.S. Speaker would also be invited to 
        conduct a workshop aimed at Ministry of Agriculture and 
        Ministry of Economic Planning officials and other 
        appropriate government officials and academics (two days) 
        to consider Malawi\'s biotech investment strategies. To 
        follow up these meetings, the Public Affairs Section 
        would continue with roundtable discussions and academic 
        lectures with Malawian scientists to further develop 
        biotech strategies. 
     b)   Consumers: Visit the most populated districts with a 
        local biotech expert, train local NGOS to communicate 
        with the villagers, and supply pamphlets and 
        informational material in the local language explaining 
        the safety of biotech maize.  Pamphlets would be in 
        simple language but would explain the basics of biotech. 
        Design radio and television messages - advertisements and 
        longer shows/discussion - to widely disseminate the 
        biotech message (i.e. that biotech maize is safe to eat). 
        Advertisements would be in local languages discussing the 
        safety of biotech maize.  Longer discussions would focus 
        on a variety of topics, including the uses of biotech, 
        biotech as a tool for fighting hunger, biotech and the 
        environment, and biotech and trade.  The key to this 
        strategy is that Malawian NGOs and experts will help 
        disseminate the message, not just U.S. officials 
        discussing U.S. policy.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAID, PREL, PHUM, PGOV, KCOR, ECON, PTER, MI, Terrorism, Corruption, Development, Environment 
SUBJECT: FY 2004 ESF REQUEST 
 
REF: STATE 33230 
 
1. SUMMARY. Post welcomes the opportunity to submit proposals 
for funding under ESF\'s Africa Regional Fund. Our four 
proposals are directly linked to MPP goals related to 
counterterrorism, the environment and economic development, 
and democracy and governance. 
 
2. Proposals follow: 
 
A.  Anti-Money Laundering 
------------------------- 
The GOM\'s lead agency for combating money laundering, the 
Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), has shown the will to identify, 
investigate, and interdict money laundering activities and 
has scored some modest successes over the past two years. 
The banking system\'s relative underdevelopment, lack of 
expertise in forensic accounting, and resource constraints, 
however, have kept the RBM from identifying and shutting down 
operations suspected of transferring illicit money into and 
out of Malawi. ESF funds could be well-used to increase the 
RBM\'s skills at investigating suspicious transactions and 
monitoring external financial flows by establishing an 
investigation that would eventually become a Financial 
Intelligence and Surveillance Team (FIST).  Most likely, the 
unit would be a small group that would connect the work of 
RBM\'s Bank Supervision and International Operations 
Departments.  Liaison between the Departments already occurs, 
but having a team of dedicated and well-trained professionals 
to monitor suspicious transactions would raise the profile of 
anti-money laundering activities. 
 
The main components of an ESF project would be one-time costs 
to equip the FIST, such as computers and training for the 
team members.  Training would be most beneficial if conducted 
in Malawi with an experienced investigator in the country for 
at least 60 days and further available for follow-up. 
Experts could be brought in from South Africa, where the head 
SADC regional trainer for money laundering prevention and 
compliance is located, or from the U.S. 
 
Estimated cost: $100,000 
 
MPP linkage: This project strengthens the Mission\'s ability 
to support increased GOM participation in the fight against 
terrorism, particularly in the regional context.  MPP Goal 
Paper 2, \"Democratic System and Practices\", Strategy 3 
supports increased Malawian participation in the regional 
fight against terrorism. A likely impact of this proposal 
would be in the first performance indicator, \"Increased 
Support for International and Regional Counterterrorism 
Initiatives\". 
 
B.  Counter-Terrorism Legislation 
--------------------------------- 
Since the terrorist attacks in the U.S. in 2001, the GOM has 
condemned acts of terrorism strongly, publicly, and 
frequently.  In June of 2003 the GOM matched these words with 
action by detaining and deporting five expatriate Muslims 
believed to be linked to Al Qaeda.  While this operation was 
generally successful, one weakness revealed was the complete 
lack of counterterrorism legislation within the country. 
Though the GOM has ratified eleven of the twelve UN 
Conventions on counterterrorism, such legislation remains 
absent domestically.  The GOM has expressed interest in 
drafting such legislation, and has directly asked the USG for 
assistance. 
 
Post proposes that sufficient ESF funds be allocated to allow 
USG subject matter experts from DoJ to travel to Lilongwe in 
order to work with counterparts at Malawi\'s interministerial 
Counterterrorism Task Force in drafting counterterrorism 
legislation appropriate for the country\'s legal system. 
Additionally, the GOM would have a Washington D.C. point of 
contact to consult with on a regular (and as-needed) basis to 
consult with regarding the implementation of and legal 
interpretation of such laws. 
 
Estimated cost: $35,000 
 
MPP linkage: This project supports the Mission\'s goal of 
increasing support for international and regional 
counterterrorism initiatives.  Malawi has shown its 
willingness to succeed in preventing terrorist activities, 
and with some assistance in capacity building could play a 
constructive role in regional efforts to combat terrorism. 
Strategy 3 of MPP Goal Paper 2, \"Democratic System and 
Practices\", supports increased Malawian participation in the 
regional fight against terrorism. A likely impact of this 
proposal would be in the first performance indicator, 
\"Increased Support for International and Regional 
Counterterrorism Initiatives\". 
 
C. Environment 
-------------- 
Malawi\'s ability to supply enough hydro-electric power to its 
people depends heavily on two things: the Liwonde Barrage, 
which retains and releases the waters of Lake Malawi and the 
Shire River; and the string of Nkhula power stations, all of 
which are located down-stream of the barrage on the lower 
Shire River.  A growing encroachment of aquatic weeds around 
the Liwonde Barrage and the in the river has contributed to 
electricity supply problems, which have worsened to the point 
of hindering economic development.  The Electricity Supply 
Company of Malawi (ESCOM) has said the weeds and increasing 
siltation in the river basin have severely hampered power 
generation.  Aquatic weeds clogging the aging Liwonde Barrage 
and Nkhula power stations worsen in the rainy season as heavy 
rains flood the riverbanks and send mats of thick reeds 
adrift. Suspension of power generation, necessary to remove 
weed build up and flush filtration systems, in turn prevents 
businesses, medical facilities, and government services form 
operating.  One report noted growing sanitation problems in 
Blantyre because the Water Board did not have adequate 
electricity to properly manage the water systems. 
 
Post proposes that ESF funds be provided to allow 
subject-matter experts to conduct an engineering assessment 
and architectural refurbishment of the Liwonde Barrage.  Such 
work would help better regulate water flow and control 
aquatic weed levels in the Lower Shire River where the 
hydroelectric plants are located.

MPP linkage: This project supports MPP Goal Paper 1 in 
fostering economic growth and development.  Advances made in 
this sector will contribute to the country\'s ability to 
stabilize its fragile economy, contribute to political 
stability, and encourage sustainable environmental 
management. 
 
D.  Controlling Corruption 
-------------------------- 
Malawi\'s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has encountered 
significant obstacles in its efforts to carry-out is mandate 
as a watchdog of corruption.  Stalled legislation, lack of 
civic awareness, and a lack of understanding of the results 
of corruption combined with a weak political will, have all 
contributed to the problem.  While certain civil-society 
groups are attempting to push for appropriate corruption 
controls, the voice is weak and lacks the more compelling 
support of informed public consensus.  To reinvigorate past 
and ongoing efforts, and to build upon the opportunity for 
broad public debate which arises after national elections, 
the U.S. Mission would support a broad-based civic education 
drive.  Activities would focus on concrete examples of how 
corruption impacts the lives of ordinary people and stimulate 
involvement at the civic level, educating citizens about the 
need to combat corruption at all levels of government. 
 
The project would likely be implemented using an existing 
USAID central mechanism combined with an innovative approach. 
In concert with Transparency International, this project 
would engage civic leaders, government officials, and local 
advocacy groups. 
 
Estimated cost: $300,000 
 
MPP linkage:  Control of corruption is a key element in 
strengthening democratic institutions in Malawi.  In goal 
paper 2, Democratic System and Practices, the second 
performance indicator measures success with Transparency 
International\'s Corruption Perception Index.  This project 
would likely improve Malawi\'s standing on this index, pushing 
the country closer to Millennium Challenge Account 
eligibility.

Mutharika, four from opposition parties, and one independent. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
2. (SBU) Vice President (and former UDF heavyweight) Justin 
Malewezi\'s last minute decision to break away from the 
Mgwirizano Coalition and contest as an independent 
presidential candidate typifies the increasing divisions in 
the opposition (septel).  With five candidates splitting the 
opposition vote, the UDF/AFORD coalition is well positioned 
to win with a plurality, reminiscent of the 2001 Zambian 
elections.  With three months left before polling day, the 
opposition\'s factionalization makes the UDF/AFORD coalition 
the clear front-runner. 
 
3. (U) Official presidential candidates and running mates as 
declared to the MEC are as follows:

SUBJECT: MALAWI: DONORS SPLIT OVER BANK AND FUND PROGRAMS 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  (SBU) Minster of Finance Jumbe made a pitch on March 
1 for donors to support Malawi\'s IMF and World Bank 
programs.  Stating that statistical discrepancies in its 
submission to the Fund have been largely resolved, Jumbe 
claimed that Malawi has made progress on its 
macroeconomic stabilization program and needs assistance 
to make further progress.  Repeated failures to meet 
targets, foot-dragging on agreed upon goals, and 
questionable financial submissions by the GOM have 
depleted donor confidence, and a split has emerged among 
donors over whether a \"tough love\" approach is the best 
way to move forward.  Although we are mindful of Malawi\'s 
need for assistance and do not wish to scuttle the Bank\'s 
Structural Adjustment Credit, we continue to question GOM 
commitment to its macroeconomic program, and judge that 
resuming disbursements now without significant fiscal and 
structural progress would send the wrong signals to those 
who will be elected in May.  End summary. 
 
GOM, World Bank Make a Pitch to the Bilateral Donors 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
2.  (U) On March 1, Minister of Finance Jumbe briefed 
bilateral donors on the GOM\'s progress with its IMF 
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and with the 
World Bank\'s proposed $50 million Structural Adjustment 
Credit (SAC, sometimes referred to as FIMAG) for Malawi. 
Representatives from Norway, Britain, the EU, Germany, 
and Canada were present, as was World Bank Country Manger 
Dunstan Wai and a staff member from the local IMF office. 
The Ambassador, AID Director, and Econoff attended for 
the U.S. Mission. 
 
3.  (U) Wai opened the meeting by stating that \"a pattern 
of inconsistencies\" in the GOM\'s data submissions to the 
IMF had led to donor doubts about performance under the 
PRGF.  Wai noted that the World Bank was seeking a 
\"comfort letter\" from the IMF regarding Malawi\'s 
macroeconomic performance before going forward with the 
SAC, and, given that linkage, that bilateral donor doubts 
had the potential to affect the timing and substance of 
the SAC.  He suggested that the meeting be used to 
clarify recent GOM actions. 
 
4.  (SBU) In response, Minister Jumbe stated that 
statistical discrepancies in the GOM\'s submissions to the 
IMF came from a succession of estimates and \"tentative 
figures,\" rather than actual returns.  He stated that the 
GOM had repeatedly corrected errors, that there \"was 
nothing funny\" in the numbers, and that, after a 
verification exercise, the discrepancy had been reduced 
from 3.2 billion Malawi Kwacha ($29 million) to MK 227 
million ($2 million).  (Note: The fact that the IMF has 
not given a quantitative evaluation locally for months, 
and the continuing absence of an IMF Resident 
Representative, has not helped matters.  We would suggest 
that it would be in the IMF\'s, and the GOM\'s, best 
interests to place a temporary representative in Malawi 
during this crucial time for the PRGF.) 
 
5.  (SBU) Outlining overall performance, Jumbe 
acknowledged that the GOM had spent beyond its fiscal 
targets as of December, but stated that factors \"beyond 
our control,\" such as higher-than-expected interest 
payments, had caused the overexpenditure.  He placed 
ultimate blame squarely on the donors, stating that \"if 
we had received donor funds, we would have lowered 
interest rates and made our budget.\"  On the GOM\'s 
performance toward PRGF \"prior actions\" and structural 
criteria, Jumbe claimed that significant progress is 
being made. 
 
6.  (SBU) Jumbe also stated that the proposed 
Supplemental Budget was at an advanced stage, and that it 
would be submitted to Parliament within the next three 
weeks.  He stated that, despite a MK 6 billion in extra 
domestic revenue, the budget would call for authorization 
of a MK 11 billion ($100 million) deficit, a significant 
change from the MK 3 billion surplus targeted for FY 
2003/04.  He cited MK 7 billion in missing donor support, 
unbudgeted interest expenses, and MK 3 billion in new 
development budget expenses as the primary components of 
the spending swing.  (Comment: While we will have to wait 
to see the complete budget for a proper evaluation, the 
spending swing and enormous proposed deficit cast doubt 
on both fiscal discipline and the program\'s overall 
effectiveness.) 
 
7.  (SBU) Jumbe plainly stated that \"Malawi needs help\" 
and pitched that \"things are not so bad.\"  He asked for 
donor support for the Fund and Bank programs to help 
\"those of us\" behind the macroeconomic stabilization 
program (a reference we took to exclude President 
Muluzi).  He also made a veiled threat that the collapse 
of the Bank and Fund programs could compromise the 
conduct of May\'s Presidential and Parliamentary 
elections. 
 
Donors Split Over Way Forward 
----------------------------- 
8.  (SBU) In this meeting and in other recent exchanges, 
divisions have appeared among the donors over how to deal 
with GOM performance and its Fund and Bank programs. 
Repeated failures to meet program criteria, foot-dragging 
on structural reforms requiring primarily political will 
(i.e., strengthening the Corrupt Practices Act or 
publishing of a report on last year\'s maize scandals), 
questionable data submissions to the IMF and CABS group, 
and a penchant for blaming the donors for missed targets 
have contributed to a general deterioration of confidence 
in the GOM and a willingness to delay or suspend programs 
while waiting for performance improvements.  At the same 
time, however, it is recognized that Malawi\'s economy is 
fragile and that the poor would bear the brunt of aid 
cuts.  Different levels of tolerance for the humanitarian 
risks involved, and emotional and financial investments 
in cherished development projects, have split the donors. 
Nor are the donors in agreement on whether our focus 
should be on sending the right signals to May\'s incoming 
government or salvaging what we can from the current one. 
 
9.  (SBU) The breakdown by donors, by tolerance for a 
\"tough love\" approach, is as follows: 
 
--Norway has shown the least tolerance for a \"tough love\" 
approach, and the Norwegian Ambassador showed great 
frustration during the meeting that more aid was not 
reaching schools and hospitals.  His personal frustration 
may also reflect the impending visit of Norway\'s Minister 
of Development, who is reportedly less sympathetic to 
Malawi\'s case than the Ambassador.  Norway has made 
bilateral disbursements since the October PRGF review, 
and has discussed the idea of basing all of its 2004/05 
disbursements on the current CABS review in order to 
provide \"predictability\" to GOM aid inflows. 
 
--The UK appears to be internally split, with some 
Department of International Development (DfID) staff 
wishing to disburse their last 5 million pound tranche of 
support, and others (including the High Commissioner) 
taking a tougher line.  The High Commissioner told the 
Ambassador today that while the donors -- including the 
Fund and the Bank -- \"can\'t walk away\" from Malawi, the 
GOM needs to \"bend over backwards\" to restore its 
credibility and open a path forward.  The UK is in a 
particularly difficult spot vis-a-vis the release of its 
last aid tranche, as its aid is conditioned on the IMF\'s 
assessment, but no assessment is likely to be forthcoming 
before the end-March close of the British fiscal year. 
 
--Though not represented on the Fund or Bank Executive 
Boards, the EU has been relatively forgiving on GOM 
fiscal performance but has take a tough public and 
private line regarding GOM failures to implement 
structural reforms.  The EU is funding, for example, the 
audit of arrears required as a PRGF \"prior action,\" and 
the GOM\'s dragging-out of the audit contract\'s signing 
(which took approximately eight months of negotiations) 
have grated on EU sensibilities.  So have the GOM\'s 
delays in providing reliable fiscal data to the CABS 
group, which have delayed the formalizing of the CABS 
group\'s current assessment by more than two weeks. 
 
--To contacts throughout the government, the U.S. 
Ambassador has stated that for real development to occur, 
the GOM needs to do what is necessary to energize 
Malawi\'s private sector and to reassure investors that 
sufficient anti-corruption measures are being taken. 
Keeping fiscal and structural pledges to the IMF would 
aid that effort, and he has stressed that measures which 
require primarily political will (like the PRGF 
structural conditions dealing with corruption) serve as a 
litmus test for outside observers and potential 
investors.  The aim, he has stated, is to avoid the 
dynamic fostered by the donors\' repeated willingness to 
\"lower the bar\" for the GOM -- a dynamic that continues 
to undercut the Fund program (with negative consequences 
for growth and poverty reduction) and has sustained donor 
dependency.  He has urged other donors to remember that 
the signals we send about keeping commitments today will 
define our relationship with May\'s new administration. 
 
--Canada, as represented by CIDA, has also pushed the 
message that the donor-GOM dynamic, where the GOM is not 
held to its commitments, is unhealthy and must be 
changed.  CIDA has reserved its harshest criticism, 
though, for the Fund and the Bank\'s unrealistic 
assumptions and projections, which have been put in place 
for internal bureaucratic Bank and Fund purposes (and to 
which the GOM has been complicit in order to keep up 
funding), but which set up the GOM to fail in succeeding 
reviews. 
 
Comment 
------- 
10.  (SBU) The World Bank clearly engineered the meeting 
between the Minister of Finance and bilateral donors to 
resolve lingering questions about GOM performance and to 
build support for the SAC among Executive Board member 
countries.  With Malwi\'s case already having been delayed 
once for the World Bank Executive Board, the effort comes 
very late, and as one EU contact put it, \"Confidence 
can\'t be restored by organizing one meeting....\" 
 
11.  (SBU) Confidence in the GOM indeed remains a key 
question for us.  We continue to question GOM commitment 
to its macroeconomic stabilization plan, as evinced by 
repeated failures to meet fiscal and structural criteria. 
And while we do not seek to scuttle Malawi\'s Bank and 
fund programs, resuming disbursements now absent progress 
on fiscal and structural criteria would undercut our long- 
term development goals in Malawi.

CLASSIFIED BY:  AMBASSADOR STEVEN A. BROWNING. 
REASON:  1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) I met with President Muluzi at his request on 
February 18 at his private residence in Blantyre.  We 
discussed his three-point agenda:  a) USG assistance 
in training Malawi Defense Force (MDF) officers as 
helicopter pilots; b) USG support of an HIV/AIDS 
Center he wishes to lead after he leaves government; 
and c) Malawi\'s backing of USG efforts in Iraq and his 
offer to send there a \"token\" MDF contingent.  Muluzi 
has enriched himself while President and will stay 
politically active after leaving office.  The post- 
meeting, hour-long tour of his residential compound 
and nearby maize fields was probably intended to 
burnish his image a bit and strengthen our personal 
relationship, most likely his primary goal for the 
visit.  End Summary. 
 
THE FORMAL AGENDA 
----------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Muluzi complained that he has been \"grounded\" 
since \"all but one\" of the MDF helicopter pilots are 
incapacitated with HIV/AIDS, and stated the MDF needed 
help with an accelerated officer-training program 
since 147 officers had died in the past year.  I 
explained the USG had in place a robust training 
program with the MDF and if the MDF saw helicopter 
pilot training as a high priority it should be fairly 
easy to re-order its training schedule.  (Comment:  At 
a USG-hosted reception two days later, I raised the 
President\'s concerns with the MDF\'s Chief of Training, 
Brig. Gen. Cosgrove Mituka.  He was surprised by the 
President\'s request, explaining that, while they were 
short of pilots, they certainly had more than one 
available.  Mituka stated that pilot training was not 
the MDF\'s highest priority.  Muluzi has been relying 
heavily on the MDF helicopter fleet as he travels the 
country campaigning for the May 18 elections.  It may 
be that the MDF has not been totally forthcoming with 
the President on the health of the pilot corps to 
reduce wear and tear on the fleet and on the pilots.) 
 
3.  (C)  Muluzi sketched out his plan for an HIV/AIDS 
Center.  It would be modeled after the center led by 
Nelson Mandela, leanly staffed and he would accept no 
salary.  He expected to travel around the country 
conducting seminars, visiting schools, distributing 
books, meeting with village chiefs and \"headmen,\" 
educating them and raising public awareness about 
HIV/AIDS.  Muluzi stressed that his initial target 
audience would be the country\'s \"polygamous village 
chiefs who are murdering young girls\" with their 
widely practiced sexual initiation rites. 
 
4.  (C) Muluzi had recently won some praise for his 
remarks at the launch of Malawi\'s National HIV/AIDS 
Strategy during which, for the first time, he 
acknowledged he had been tested for HIV and his status 
was negative, and that AIDS was the cause of his 
brother\'s death three years earlier (reftel C).  Given 
his otherwise tepid anti-HIV/AIDS efforts to date, I 
asked the President why, with all the resources of the 
state at his disposal for the past 10 years, he 
planned to devote so much attention to HIV/AIDS 
awareness after he leaves office.  He explained that 
he would have \"more freedom to speak out\" when out of 
office.  Muluzi promised to send me a concept paper 
concerning his center. 
 
5.  (C) Iraq was the third point Muluzi raised with 
me.  He encouraged the U.S. to not \"give it up\" and 
asked me to pass on his \"word of encouragement.\"  He 
offered a \"token\" contingent of MDF forces to join the 
coalition forces in Iraq (reftel B). 
 
THE SHOW 
-------- 
 
6.  (C) Muluzi completed his agenda after 30 minutes 
and asked me how much time I had.  Hearing that my 
time was his, he drove me (Note:  10 years of being 
chauffeured in multi-vehicle motorcades have 
definitely eroded his driving skills.) to a nearby 
field to view his 40 hectares of seed maize.  While he 
professed to be a farmer at heart and eager to return 
to simpler civilian life, his inability to answer 
simple questions about his crop, like when it was 
planted, argue that \"Muluzi the Farmer\" is more image 
than reality.  That perception was strengthened when 
he rolled out his personal photographer to capture on 
film the President and U.S. Ambassador, both in dark 
business suits, walking through muddy maize fields, a 
scene vaguely reminiscent of President Nixon walking 
the southern California beaches in suit and wing tips. 
 
7.  (C)  Back at his private estate in suburban 
Blantyre, which he calls his village, he took great 
pride in showing me his kitchen maize field, vegetable 
garden, chickens, goats, turkeys, cement fish pond and 
mushroom shed.  Clearly unaware of the irony of his 
words, the Head of State and one of the country\'s 
richest men expressed amazement that there was hunger 
in Malawi.  \"There is no reason for food insecurity in 
this country,\" he said, sweeping his arms over the 
hilltop vista of his livestock and gardens. 
 
8.  (C)  Comment:  Having failed in his attempt to 
amend the Constitution to allow him to run for a third 
term, Muluzi is making a place for himself once he 
leaves office.  His self-engineered election to the 
chairmanship of the ruling UDF party and his selection 
of 70-year-old Bingu Wa Mutharika as the UDF\'s 
Presidential candidate, a man widely acknowledged to 
be a lackluster campaigner with no political base of 
his own and thus heavily dependent on Muluzi, signal 
that he plans to play an activist post-Presidential 
role.  I was approached several months ago by a senior 
member of Muluzi\'s administration with a request that 
the USG find something meaningful to occupy Muluzi and 
get him out of the country after he left office so as 
to \"keep him out of mischief\" (reftel A).  While 
discussing his proposed HIV/AIDS Center I asked Muluzi 
if he also would be willing to consider a prestigious 
position in Europe or the US for a few months after he 
left office.  He allowed that he could only be out of 
the country for two weeks at a time, claiming he had 
too many business interests to manage. 
 
9.  (C)  Muluzi has never hesitated to telephone me 
when he has issues to discuss, and his three formal 
agenda items could all have been easily addressed over 
the phone.  During the drive and tour of his estate, I 
tried to engage Muluzi in issues I wanted to discuss 
with him.  He would have none of it.  Two days before 
receiving the call to meet Muluzi the country\'s 
leading paper published an interview with me in which 
I delivered a strong anti-corruption message.  I 
assumed Muluzi summoned me to express his displeasure 
with my public criticism of his administration.  My 
sense is that the anti-corruption interview did prompt 
the meeting, but that his strategy was to embrace and 
befriend rather than admonish.  Muluzi is a charming 
and engaging politician, and widely considered to have 
greatly enriched himself at public expense while 
President.  Mindful of the predicament Zambia\'s former 
President Chiluba faces, Muluzi may be looking to 
enlarge his circle of admirers and engage in a bit of 
pre-departure legacy building.  He may also be working 
to ensure the continuation of some of his diplomatic 
relationships once he leaves publicly elected office.

REF: STATE 007869 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  Based on a review of GOM practices, 
interviews with civil society groups, GOM officials, and 
press accounts, Malawi should not be designated as a 
country of origin, transit, or destination of the most 
severe forms of international trafficking in significant 
numbers of men, women, or children for 2003-2004. Post 
responses are keyed to cable checklist (reftel). END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. Post Contact Information 
Post point of contact for TIP issues is Consular-Political 
officer Kiera Emmons, office phone 265-1-773-166 ext 3411, 
fax 265-1-774-976.  Estimated time spent per officer in 
preparation of this report are as follows: Con-Pol Officer 
- 8.0; RSO - 0.5 review, DCM - 2.0 review, Ambassador - 1.0 
review. 
 
3. Overview 
A.  Malawi is a country of origin and a destination country 
for international trafficking in women and children, but 
there is insufficient data to qualify it as a country with 
a significant number of victims of severe forms of 
trafficking as defined by legislation. Various sources 
agree that some trafficking likely occurs within the 
country\'s borders, primarily from the northern region to 
various locations along the lakeshore for purposes of sex- 
tourism.  No reliable estimates exist regarding the extent 
of the problem.  Sources of information include one non- 
governmental organization; the Malawi Human Rights 
Commission; the Ministry of Gender, Youth, and Community 
Services; and a 2003 International Organization for 
Migration (IOM) report.  None are completely reliable and 
Malawi-based research on the topic is scant. Certain groups 
have been identified as more at-risk, primarily young women 
and girls, and secondarily adolescent boys. 
 
B.  There are some reports of persons trafficked from 
Zambia to Malawi. Persons are reportedly trafficked from 
Malawi to South Africa, Zambia, Tanzania, and Europe 
(specifically the U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands). The 
GOM believes that most persons are trafficked to South 
Africa, though in previous years there have been a few 
known cases of trafficking to Europe. 
 
C.  No known changes in direction of trafficking. Reports 
indicate an increase in extent of trafficking, however this 
may be attributed to an increase in reporting on the 
problem. 
 
D.  No efforts are currently underway to examine the 
problem in Malawi. In FY03 the one NGO dealing with TIP in 
Malawi applied for but was not granted USG funding to study 
and address the issue. The 2003 IOM report, released in 
April 2003, was not available for use in last year\'s 
report. 
 
E.  Malawi has not been a destination for trafficking, but 
recent anecdotal evidence suggests that women trafficked 
from Zambia are working in brothels on the outskirts of 
Lilongwe and Blantyre. It is unclear what methods are used 
to ensure compliance, however the depressed economy and 
lack of opportunities for women and girls imply that 
compliance would be accomplished by remuneration. 
 
F.  Primary trafficking targets are young women and girls. 
On occasion boys have reportedly been trafficked within the 
country.  The traffickers have been reported as local or 
neighboring-nation businesswomen, working in collaboration 
with men. Truck drivers have also been implicated in 
trafficking of women and girls to South Africa.  Some 
sources indicate an international trafficking syndicate may 
be operating in Malawi .  Young women and girls have 
reportedly been approached in public places, near schools, 
and at bus stops by women and men offering them jobs in 
fashion, food service, and domestic fields abroad.  Various 
sources report that in the North, along the Tanzanian 
border, young girls are sold or traded to tribal chiefs and 
transported to other villages. 
 
G.  There is political will to combat the problem of TIP, 
though it is by no means the most pressing item on the GOM 
agenda. The GOM does not have funding or resources to 
seriously address the issue. Legislation to criminalize TIP 
was introduced to Parliament in 2003 but not passed. 
Periodically, government officials will publicly denounce 
trafficking. Since 2001, seven cases involving trafficking 
have been prosecuted in Malawi, though trafficking is not 
in itself a crime. Malawi is able to devote little of its 
scarce resources to trafficking, though efforts are 
underway to improve border security and professionalism of 
immigration officials. (NOTE: Post is hopeful that 
legislation to criminalize trafficking will receive 
attention from Parliament in 2004, and will advocate for 
passage of such legislation with the new government 
following 2004 elections.  END NOTE) 
 
H.  No government officials are known/suspected to be 
directly involved in TIP, but one Malawi government 
official commented that immigration officers likely don\'t 
recognize trafficking for what it is, and noted that 
traffickers may be able to take advantage of this lack of 
awareness and bribe border officials to allow young girls 
to transit undocumented.  While not complicit, leaders have 
been unable to devote sufficient attention to the matter. 
It is possible that international transport of victims 
occurs through the acquisition of illegitimate - but 
usually genuine - passports or use of one passport by 
multiple victims. Extremely porous borders also contribute 
to the problem. To date, no government officials have been 
prosecuted for involvement in trafficking, but the GOM is 
making attempts to tighten border controls and prevent 
passport fraud. 
 
I.  Funding and training for police and immigration forces 
is insufficient, and law enforcement officials are often 
accused of corruption.  The government generally lacks 
resources to assist trafficking victims, but the Malawi 
Human Rights Commission and the Ministry of Gender and 
Community Services have, in the past, been able to provide 
nominal assistance in the repatriation of trafficking 
victims. 
 
J.  The government is severely limited in its ability to 
systematically implement and monitor anti-trafficking 
efforts. 
 
K.  It is against the law to receive money gained through 
prostitution of others.  Thus, ownership of a brothel, for 
example, is illegal, while the act of prostitution is not. 
Prostitution is common, and law enforcement is limited in 
its capacity and willingness to block prostitution. 
 
L.  The practice of buying and selling child-brides occurs 
in Malawi, but is not common. Some tribes, particularly in 
the North of Malawi along the border with Tanzania, engage 
in activities where young girls are traded for land, 
livestock, and other commodities when money is not 
available. Malawian men are not known to travel 
internationally in order to purchase child-brides. 
 
4.  PREVENTION 
A.  The Government of Malawi has acknowledged that 
trafficking exists, and largely blames foreigners.  Without 
specific data and adequate resources, the GOM has been 
largely unable to address the problem. 
 
B.  Cases relevant to trafficking have previously been 
handled by the Ministry of Gender and Community Services 
(MOGCS). The Malawi Human Rights Commission has also 
informally looked into the problem, though limited 
resources have prevented a full-scale study or 
investigation. The Ministry of Gender and Community 
Services has the lead in coordinating GOM anti-trafficking 
efforts.  The MOGCS has formed a committee that includes 
representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the 
Department of Immigration, Department of Customs, and the 
Police. The committee does not meet regularly. 
 
C.  The government does not have a national plan to address 
trafficking issues. 
 
D.  The government has been involved in programs promoting 
the rights of women and children which may indirectly 
prevent trafficking.  Workshops, training sessions, and 
public awareness campaigns have been held. 
 
E.  The government is unable to support sustained 
prevention programs due to lack of resources. 
 
F.  One local NGO deals with trafficking issues and has 
engaged with government officials in the past. The Malawi 
Human Rights Commission has pressed for resources 
specifically to deal with this issue but none have been 
made available from the GOM. 
 
G.  Although checkpoints exist along all major exit routes, 
Malawi\'s borders are very porous and allow for easy illegal 
crossing.  The Department of Immigration attempts to 
monitor for trafficking, but has insufficient resources to 
accomplish this mission. 
 
H.  As reported in para. 4 B, the MOGCS convenes a 
committee to examine specific cases when they arise, but 
does not meet on a regular basis to coordinate a counter- 
trafficking strategy. The Anti-Corruption Bureau, the 
Office of the Ombudsman, and the Auditor General handle 
issues of public corruption. 
 
I.  The GOM has the will to participate in multilateral 
trafficking initiatives, but lacks the resources. 
 
J.  The GOM does not have a national plan of action to 
address trafficking in persons. 
 
K.  Dr. Mary Shawa, Deputy Director of the MOGCS, is the 
main point of contact for trafficking-related issues. 
 
5.  INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS 
A.  There is no law specifically criminalizing trafficking 
into, out of, or within Malawi.  Previous legislation 
mandating a 14-year minimum sentence for anyone convicted 
of \"promoting, managing, or transporting any person into or 
out of Malawi with the purpose to engage that other person 
in prostitution\" was withdrawn from the National Assembly 
for further review and has not been reintroduced. 
Traffickers can be prosecuted under Article 140(c) and 
140(d) of the Penal Code, which criminalizes the transport 
of a woman from Malawi for prostitution.   Article 141 
penalizes anyone who, by threats or intimidation, false 
pretenses, or false representation or by administering 
drugs, procures any woman or girl to have unlawful carnal 
relations in the country or elsewhere. Articles 36 and 37 
of the Penal Code criminalize misuse or forgery of travel 
documents.  The constitution states \"no person shall be 
held in slavery or servitude\". 
 
B.  There is no penalty at this time, as specific anti- 
trafficking legislation has not been passed. 
 
C.  The minimum penalty for rape is six years, but the High 
Court can sentence a person to life imprisonment or death 
depending on the circumstances of the assault.  (NOTE: 
Although the death penalty is permitted under Malawian law, 
President Bakili Muluzi has publicly stated that no 
prisoners will be executed while he is in office.  End 
Note.) 
 
D.  Because specific legislation is still pending, no cases 
have been prosecuted to date. Seven cases relevant to 
trafficking have been prosecuted in Malawi since 2001. 
 
E.  Unsubstantiated anecdotal information alleges that 
Malawian businesswomen, truck drivers, and possibly 
Nigerian trafficking syndicates are behind trafficking in 
and out of Malawi.  There is little credible information 
regarding trafficking in persons in general, and none 
specific to the perpetrators. 
 
F.  No, the government of Malawi has not actively 
investigated cases of trafficking. 
 
G.  No. 
 
H.  There have been no instances this year of GOM 
participation in international investigations or 
prosecutions of trafficking cases. 
 
I.  There are no reports of extraditions associated with 
trafficking. (NOTE: Forced extradition of Malawian citizens 
is not specifically prohibited by the Constitution, but has 
not been used. End Note.) 
 
J.   No. 
 
K.  No information available. 
 
L.  ILO Conventions 182, 29, and 105 ratified by the GOM on 
November 19, 1999.  Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution, and child pornography signed by the GOM on 
September 7, 2000, but not ratified.  Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons not signed or 
ratified by the GOM. 
6. PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO VICTIMS 
A.  Very limited assistance to victims is available from 
the GOM, local government institutions, or civil society 
groups. 
 
B. No. 
 
C.  No information available. 
 
D.  Family based or NGO-assisted care is the only option 
for victims in Malawi.  Victims with difficult or abusive 
family circumstances have been placed in detention centers 
when no other option was available. 
 
E.  The GOM has not enacted legislation that would make 
legal recourse for trafficking victims possible. The GOM 
would encourage victims to participate in an investigation. 
There is no victim\'s restitution program. 
 
F.  None. 
 
G.  No.  During the year Malawian police collaborated with 
Interpol and the Southern African Regional Police Chiefs 
Organization (SARPCO) to develop the ability to identify 
and investigate potential traffickers. Malawian embassies 
abroad are not known to have any specialized training for 
dealing with trafficking victims. 
 
H.  None known during the reporting year. 
 
I.  Eye of the Child and the Malawi Human Rights Youth 
Network have expressed interest in investigating the issue 
as well as providing assistance to victims, but they have 
very limited resources available.  During the reporting 
year, post submitted a funding proposal to G/TIP for an Eye 
of the Child project. This proposal was not funded (see 
para. 3 D).

1.  With elections just 66 days away, the 
government-controlled media remains biased in 
its coverage, broadcasting pro-government news 
and ruling party campaign reports while 
providing almost no access to the opposition. 
The Public Affairs Committee, a local civil 
society group composed of influential religious 
leaders, initiated legal proceedings on March 10 
against the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation 
(MBC) and Television Malawi (TVM) for their 
bias.  The Lilongwe Press Club recorded 
interviews with the different parties and bought 
airtime on MBC, but MBC has refused to broadcast 
them, saying that they can only be aired during 
the campaign period, which begins on March 20. 
 
2.  Though government, MBC, and TVM officially 
have denied any bias, post\'s monthly overview of 
state radio news clearly shows the strong pro- 
government bias of MBC.  The Malawi Electoral 
Commission\'s Media Monitoring Unit has also been 
issuing reports indicating that the \"positive 
news share\" on MBC and TVM overwhelmingly favors 
the UDF. 
 
3. Comment:  The Constitution requires that MBC 
and TVM provide equal access to all parties 
during the official campaign from March 20 to 
May 18.  During the 1999 elections, state-run 
media did not comply.  Criticism of MBC and TVM 
has been sharp over the last several months, and 
pressure from the opposition, civil society, and 
donors may compel the broadcasters to provide 
somewhat more balanced coverage this year.  That 
being said, we do not expect equal or equitable 
access to be given to the opposition. End 
comment.

1. SUMMARY: The government-controlled Malawi 
Broadcasting Corporation radio is the main 
source of news for the average Malawian.  Two 
independent daily newspapers are read by a small 
segment of the urban population.  Private 
(commercial, religious, community) radio 
stations reach urban centers in the South and 
Central regions.  The urban elite has access to 
the country\'s only television station, which is 
also state-owned.  For a country that has only 
been free for ten years, following a 30-year 
dictatorial regime, the private media get good 
marks for progress.  Private radio stations are 
increasing, self-censorship by the media is 
lessening, and open debate about the importance 
of media freedom is commonplace.    END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
RADIO: THE DOMINANT MEDIA 
--------------------------- 
 
2. Government-owned and -operated Malawi 
Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) is the only radio 
station that broadcasts throughout the country. 
Broadcasting in English and the major ethnic 
languages, MBC reaches the widest audience of 
any medium in Malawi.  The station broadcasts 
all presidential events and activities live. MBC 
gives priority and prominence to news coverage 
of government and ruling UDF party events and 
very little to opposition parties and leaders. 
 
3. Independent radio in Malawi is limited in 
geographical reach.  There is, however, a 
growing number of private radio stations whose 
listenership and influence continue to expand. 
Capital Radio, on the air since 1999, reaches 
Blantyre and Lilongwe.  The FM commercial radio 
station is renowned for controversial talk shows 
that are unbiased.  Capital FM is an affiliate 
of the Voice of America, an arrangement that 
provides Malawians with a clear FM transmission 
of VOA news and programs. 
 
4.  The Malawi Institute of Journalism (MIJ) is 
part of the University of Malawi journalism 
department and operates its own private radio 
station.  It broadcasts in the Southern Region. 
The station has earned a reputation of airing 
opposition politics and presenting a wide 
spectrum of political coverage.  MIJ has 
experienced some pressure from the government to 
limit its role as a teaching institution only 
(and to refrain from airing political news), but 
MIJ is dedicated to furthering the role of 
independent media in Malawi. 
 
5. Power FM 101 is a hit music radio station 
targeting young audiences in Blantyre and 
Lilongwe.  The station, however, carries news 
bulletins hourly.  FM 101 is co-owned by the son 
of a former cabinet minister who resigned last 
year from the ruling UDF party after the 
President chose his successor without input from 
the party.  Since the rift between the owner\'s 
father and the UDF party and government, FM 101 
is airing more political news than it had in the 
past. 
 
6.  Community radio stations are increasingly 
important in the Malawi news arena.  A new 
community station has been established in 
Nkhotakota in the Central Region in addition to 
Dzimwe community radio in Mangochi (just at the 
southern tip of Lake Malawi) that was opened 
five years ago.  Community radio is supposed to 
air news important to the communities it serves, 
but these stations are airing ever more 
political issues. 
 
7. Religious stations - two Catholic, two 
Christian and one Islamic - carry general news 
and development issues, but focus primarily on 
religious material. Like community stations, 
religious stations are beginning to air more 
political news. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
NEWSPAPERS: THE URBAN ELITE 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. The \"Daily Times\" and the \"Nation\" are the 
two independent daily papers, each with a 
circulation of about 15,000 copies during the 
week, 25,000 copies on Saturdays. The print 
media, as well as electronic media, suffers from 
lack of resources and trained journalists. 
 
9. The \"Daily Times\" is owned by Blantyre Print 
and Publishing Company whose chairman is the 
ruling party\'s vice-presidential candidate in 
the 2004 polls.  Formerly owned by Life 
President Hastings Banda, and still in trust to 
his family, the \"Daily Times\" was considered a 
government paper during Banda\'s regime.  After 
the first multi-party elections in 1994, the 
\"Daily Times\" became increasingly independent, 
but still lacked the respect accorded the 
\"Nation.\"  As 2004 elections approach, the 
\"Daily Times\" is becoming more pro-government, 
including a new editorial policy that restricts 
editors to pro-government articles. 
 
10. The \"Nation\" has had a reputation of 
independence since its inception in 1993. When 
the owner of the \"Nation\", a former cabinet 
minister, fell out with the ruling UDF party in 
mid-2003, the tone of the paper began to change. 
More articles criticizing the government appear 
and fewer appear in support of the President. 
As a result, the government has greatly cut back 
its advertising in the paper. 
 
11. An assortment of weekly papers exist, but 
only one is considered a \"must-read\" by the 
urban community.  The \"Chronicle\" is stridently 
opposition, but respected by journalists and the 
public for its outspoken views.  Recently the 
National Association of Media in Southern Africa 
in Malawi awarded the \"Chronicle\" its \"Best 
Investigative Reporting Award,\" and in the past 
year the \"Chronicle\" has scooped the daily 
papers on several important issues, including 
Muluzi\'s proposed successor.  The \"Chronicle\" 
says that it is under much pressure and 
intimidation from the government, but it 
continues to speak out. 
 
12. Other weekly papers are decidedly government 
mouthpieces, such as the \"UDF News\" and the 
Information Department\'s \"Weekly News.\"  Some 
papers appear sporadically, most with a specific 
agenda of supporting or opposing the government. 
They are not taken as serious journalism, and 
circulation is low (several thousand at most.) 
 
----------------- 
TELEVISION MALAWI 
----------------- 
 
13. Television Malawi is another medium for the 
urban elite.  Like MBC, Television Malawi, 
established only in 1999, is controlled by the 
state.  No opposition politicians appear on TVM: 
only government rallies and pro-government news 
are aired.  Local programming is, however, 
limited and the station depends heavily on 
relayed programming from foreign television 
stations. Programs are from the BBC, Canal 
France International, DWS, and several religious 
television services.  One station that formerly 
relayed programming was TV Africa, which ceased 
to function in September 2003.  In October 2003, 
the Public Affairs Section donated satellite 
equipment to Television Malawi allowing it to 
broadcast VOA, World Net and C-Span everyday. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
14. As in all African countries, radio is the 
most important media outlet.  With the recent 
establishment of private radio, government 
control of broadcast media is loosening. 
Although MBC is still the only medium available 
to the majority of Malawians, private stations 
are increasing in geographical coverage, and 
calls for MBC to open its airwaves to opposition 
politicians are being heard.  The three leading 
newspapers provide credible news coverage, 
especially by African standards, and contribute 
to interesting exchanges of ideas.  Their reach 
is limited, but after 30 years of dictatorship 
and complete media control, print and private 
electronic media have made important strides 
toward independence.

BUSINESS ASSOCIATE 
 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
1. (SBU) A March 2 autopsy report revealed that Kalonga 
Stambuli, Chief Executive Officer of President Muluzi\'s Trade 
and Investment Company, was poisoned and strangled on 
December 29, 2003.  In the weeks following Stambuli\'s death, 
\"The Dispatch\" weekly newspaper printed a series of excerpts 
from Stambuli\'s personal journal, entitled \"Corrupt Practices 
by Muluzi.\"  Since Stambuli\'s death, the opposition National 
Democratic Alliance (NDA) and civil society organizations 
have repeatedly called for the ruling United Democratic Front 
(UDF) and GOM to launch an official investigation into the 
matter, and the police announced on March 12 that an inquiry 
had begun.  The allegations in Stambuli\'s journal are the 
most personal and direct accusations of corruption ever made 
publicly against the President.  END SUMMARY. 
 
AUTOPSY REPORT RELEASED 
----------------------- 
2. (U) On March 2 an autopsy report on the death of Kalonga 
Stambuli, Chief Executive Officer of President Muluzi\'s Trade 
and Investment Company, was released.  The autopsy, which had 
been initiated by a friend of the family, revealed that on 
December 29, 2003 Kalonga Stambuli was poisoned with a 
organophosphate compound and, immediately after, strangled. 
Declaring \"asphyxia due to manual strangulation\" the 
immediate cause of death, the report concluded that the death 
\"was unlikely to have been suicidal.\"  In addition, the 
report indicated a handwritten note was found beside 
Stambuli\'s body and read, \"You are very sinful.\"  The 
autopsy, which was not initiated by the police, came after 
the opposition political party National Democratic Alliance 
(NDA) made repeated public calls for the ruling United 
Democratic Front (UDF) and GOM to make official inquiries 
into Stambuli\'s death.  Since the report\'s release, several 
local human rights NGOs have pressed for an official 
investigation, which the police announced on March 12 had 
begun. 
 
STAMBULI\'S BEYOND-THE-GRAVE ACCUSATIONS 
--------------------------------------- 
3. (U) In the weeks following Stambuli\'s death, \"The 
Dispatch\" weekly newspaper serialized portions of what it 
claimed was the late Stambuli\'s personal journal, entitled 
\"Corrupt Practices by Muluzi.\"  While providing no evidence 
to substantiate the allegations, the entries detailed 
Muluzi\'s purported involvement in several illegal activities, 
including misappropriation of public funds and private 
business scandals.  The final article concluded by describing 
Stambuli\'s March 1997 decision to resign as Personal Advisor 
to the President and Secretary for Economic Planning and 
Development, though never indicated the exact circumstances 
around Stambuli\'s departure.  According to Stambuli, an 
unhappy Muluzi then had Stambuli arrested on trumped-up 
charges.  The ensuing legal battle had not been resolved at 
the time of Stambuli\'s death. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
4. (SBU) Rumors of corruption and illegal activities are not 
new to Muluzi or his administration.  However, Stambuli\'s 
accusations are the most personal and direct ever made 
publicly against Muluzi, and well-placed sources indicate 
some may be founded.  If official inquires are made into the 
Muluzi administration after the President steps down in May, 
the Stambuli case may feature prominently among them.  END 
COMMENT.

Classified By: POLOFF KIERA EMMONS FOR REASONS 1.5 B & D. 
 
1. (U) Ambassador met with Minister of Foreign Affairs Lilian 
Patel to deliver reftel demarche on Zimbabwe.  At the March 
16 meeting, the Ambassador also briefly discussed Haiti 
(septel) and the MCA with the Minister. 
 
2.  (C) Patel stated that Malawi remains hopeful for 
increased dialogue between opposition and government 
leadership in Zimbabwe.  She expressed disappointment that 
after two years, no changes had occurred in Zimbabwe despite 
Malawi\'s quiet diplomacy.  The lack of progress has, 
according to Patel, made Malawi a victim and she noted that 
Zimbabwe is Malawi\'s number two trading partner.  (NOTE: We 
take Patel\'s characterization of Malawi as a victim to be a 
reference to the regional and bilateral destabilization 
resulting from the situation in Zimbabwe. END NOTE.)  Patel 
said any anti-Mugabe position by Malawi would have a negative 
impact and acknowledged that Malawi had previously shown 
support for Zimbabwe as a matter of solidarity among African 
states.  She said that Malawi, through direct intervention by 
Muluzi, has taken initiatives on its own but cannot continue 
doing so because such initiatives would be \"misunderstood.\" 
 
2.  (C) Patel said SADC needs to take the issue of Zimbabwe 
more seriously. The way forward for SADC regarding Zimbabwe, 
she said, requires careful analysis.  She observed that 
within SADC \"certain things happen behind the scenes\" and 
that there had been \"much talk of Mugabe.\"  Patel stated that 
Malawi has done all it can within the SADC context and noted 
she has visited Zimbabwe on four occasions and the president 
has done so twice. President Muluzi, she said, is \"the first 
president who has tackled the Zimbabwe issue head-on.\"  When 
asked if she thought Muluzi would be willing to continue to 
work to resolve the situation in Zimbabwe even after his 
final term ends in May of 2004, she replied that he likely 
would, though not on a full-time basis. South Africa, she 
said, is playing a big role, though Malawi \"would have hoped 
for more.\" 
 
3.  (C)  Patel raised the issue of sanctions on her own.  She 
met with the Ambassador immediately after meeting with EU 
diplomats, and her first remark was that EU Ambassadors had 
pushed for renewal of sanctions.  She observed that targeted 
sanctions did not affect ordinary Zimbabweans, but the broad 
impact of sanctions should be carefully analyzed. She said 
sanctions may be useful in making progress \"in the absence of 
any other way.\" 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT:  Patel seemed willing to discuss the issue 
of Zimbabwe and left the impression that Malawi was 
interested in finding a solution through behind the scenes 
diplomacy within the structure of SADC.  This seems to be in 
line with earlier GOM positions, but is now more interesting 
in light of Patel\'s statements that Muluzi could be \"used as 
needed\" once out of office to address the issue. EU diplomats 
report that Patel made similar remarks to them about a future 
role for Muluzi. It appears, however, that Malawi is more 
comfortable letting SADC, and especially South Africa, take 
the lead for now.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
1. (SBU/NF) Before Parliament\'s March 20 dissolution, the 
House passed the controversial \"compromise\" version of the 
Corrupt Practices amendment, a supplementary budget, and 
other minor pieces of legislation.  At present, the 
\"compromise amendment\" appears sufficient to fulfill the 
IMF\'s relaxed structural requirements and to placate 
bilateral donors eager to disburse budgetary support to the 
GOM.  The supplementary budget, an MK 11.339 billion 
(approximately USD 105 million) increase to the MK 56.812 
billion (USD 600 million) budget already in place, has been 
made necessary by continued government borrowing from the 
domestic market and overspending by government agencies. 
Increasing nearly MK 8 billion (USD 75 million), interest 
payments on domestic debts are the largest expenditure and 
are expected to rise to more than MK 16.1 billion (USD 150 
million).  Driven by a tight deadline, the House displayed 
rare efficiency in this last planned session before May\'s 
presidential and parliamentary elections, and the session was 
filled with pertinent debate on the eve of its closure.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
CORRUPT PRACTICES AMENDMENT PASSES 
---------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) A topic of public discussion since its referral to 
the Legal Affairs Committee during the December parliamentary 
session, the Amendment to the Corrupt Practices Act passed on 
March 18 did not include provisions to allow the 
Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to prosecute cases without 
consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). 
Submission of an amendment with such provisions was 
originally required as a structural condition of the IMF\'s 
second review (reftel B).  The \"compromise\" version of the 
Amendment, which emerged and which was the subject of 
uncharacteristically passionate debate in the House, requires 
the DPP to make a decision on prosecution of ACB cases within 
21 days of their submission to the DPP, and, if consent is 
withheld, the DPP must justify to Parliament the refusal with 
\"clear reasons for the decision.\" 
 
3. (SBU/NF) According to an IMF team member, the current 
formulation of the Amendment is \"legally sufficient\" to 
satisfy the IMF\'s required \"prior actions\" for its next 
review, even though it would not have satisfied the original 
structural condition.  (COMMENT:  Although we are unclear 
about who the GOM \"compromised\" with, the UK, Norway, and the 
EU all appear satisfied with progress on this condition.) 
 
SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET OF USD 105 MILLION 
--------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Parliament accepted without changes the 
supplementary budget of MK 11.339 billion (USD 105 million) 
presented by Minister of Finance Friday Jumbe on March 15. 
Jumbe blamed the bulk of the continued domestic borrowing on 
the donors\' delays in disbursing budgetary support and 
resulting higher interest rates.  He also admitted to some 
over-expenditures, which occurred in spite of automatic 
triggers put in place to reduce spending if donor funding was 
not received, by saying it was \"technically impossible\" to 
reduce spending by some government agencies.  Jumbe explained 
that to-date over-expenditures of MK 3.008 billion (nearly 
USD 28 million) were concentrated in the Office of President 
and Cabinet, State Residences, the National Assembly, Foreign 
Affairs, Police, and Special Activities.  (NOTE: It has 
already surfaced that the supplementary budget approved by 
Parliament did not include the USD 10 million gap in 
elections funding that the Electoral Commission informed the 
donor community about on March 22, to be reported septel.) 
 
5. (U) Robust debate in the House and in public venues 
criticized the GOM for not reducing domestic debt and not 
increasing funding for pro-poor expenditures.  Leader of 
Opposition, Malawi Congress Party (MCP) MP (and presidential 
candidate) John Tembo, made a compelling speech that 
denounced the ruling United Democratic Front\'s lack of fiscal 
discipline and called for the budget to be reviewed by the 
Budget and Finance Committee of Parliament.  Civil society 
activists also lamented that the current government spends 
more on domestic debt servicing than on pro-poor 
expenditures, including education and health. 
 
OTHER MINOR PIECES OF LEGISLATION 
--------------------------------- 
6. (U) In addition to the Corrupt Practices Amendment and the 
supplementary budget, the House approved a loan from the 
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development for construction of 
a road, an International Development Association Loan, 
commencement of rural electrification projects, and an 
amendment regarding community-friendly natural parks and 
wildlife management. 
 
DISSOLUTION OF THE HOUSE 
------------------------ 
7. (U) As constitutionally mandated, the House was dissolved 
on March 20 in advance of the May 18 elections.  The 
dissolution of Parliament marks the beginning of the official 
campaign period, allowing candidates and parties to legally 
campaign.  (NOTE: Although Parliament has officially been 
dissolved, the House can be re-convened if deemed necessary 
by the Speaker.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (SBU) Driven by deadlines, the House was 
uncharacteristically efficient and filled with legitimate 
debate on the eve of its closure.  The particularly 
passionate addresses given by members of the opposition 
regarding the Amendment to the Corrupt Practices Act (in 
favor of the Anti-Corruption Bureau\'s independence) 
represented genuine democratic discourse in a House normally 
dominated by the ruling party\'s agenda.

SUBJECT: INDEPENDENTS STAND OUT AS PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATES 
 
REF: 03 LILONGWE 1202 
 
1. (U) On the official roster of candidates contesting in the 
May 18 parliamentary elections, each parliamentary district 
generally has between 4 and 13 candidates, with a notable 
number of contestants registered as independents.  The ruling 
United Democratic Front (UDF)/Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) 
coalition, the opposition Mgwirizano Coalition, Malawi 
Congress Party (MCP), and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) 
were the only parties able to field contestants nationally, 
but with heavy concentrations in their respective regions of 
main support.  Many of the independent candidates are recent 
defectors from the ruling UDF.  Most parliamentary districts 
have at least one female contestant. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
2. (SBU) Large numbers of independent candidates contesting 
in parliamentary elections is a new phenomenon for Malawi and 
is likely a result of discontent about the ways in which 
party primaries were run.  While the presence of independents 
represents a new willingness by candidates to maneuver 
outside the generally machine-like operations of the 
political parties, it is uncertain that candidates contesting 
as independents, if successful, will remain unaffiliated, 
especially if their former party is voted into power.  In 
most instances, the independents separated from their parties 
after losing a primary race, and they have no real grievances 
with their former party.  (It is telling to note, however, 
that party discipline within the ruling UDF is eroding.)  At 
any rate, Parliament after the May elections will be much 
more politically diverse than at present.  At least seven 
parties are poised to win one or more seats in the House, and 
the creation and interplay of parliamentary coalitions will 
likely tax the National Assembly\'s ability to critically 
examine and pass legislation.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) Since his January 1 resignation from the ruling United 
Democratic Front vice presidency and announcement of 
indefinite leave as Malawi\'s Vice President, Justin Malewezi 
has joined the opposition People\'s Progressive Movement 
(PPM), declared himself an independent presidential 
candidate, been ousted from PPM, and been taken to court by 
government in a bid to remove him as the country\'s Vice 
President.  Meanwhile, his public reputation has suffered 
from perceptions of him being \"power hungry\" and 
\"opportunistic.\"  Known as one of the GOM\'s hardest working 
and professional technocrats, Malewezi has sacrificed his 
public stature by his recent political missteps and has 
reinforced the public\'s opinion that he is not politically 
savvy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
POLITICAL MISJUDGMENTS 
---------------------- 
2. (SBU) After resigning from the ruling United Democratic 
Front (UDF) vice presidency and announcing his indefinite 
leave as Malawi\'s Vice President, Malewezi joined the 
opposition People\'s Progressive Movement (PPM) on January 8 
and was subsequently elected that party\'s vice president 
(reftel A).  As a member of the Mgwirizano Coalition of 
opposition parties, PPM, eligible to field only one candidate 
for the Coalition\'s leadership, saw PPM president Aleke Banda 
elected as the Coalition\'s running mate.  Rumors at the time 
indicated that the clergy orchestrating the Coalition\'s 
candidate selection procedures had always supported Malewezi 
as their preferred Coalition presidential candidate. When 
technicalities prevented consideration of Malewezi as an 
additional candidate from PPM, Malewezi reportedly attempted 
to stand as the Malawi Forum for Unity and Development 
(MAFUNDE) candidate in the Coalition elections and then 
decided not to.  Malewezi\'s quick consideration to turn to 
MAFUNDE, after recently leaving the ruling UDF and joining 
PPM, did not play well. 
 
3. (SBU) Two weeks after the Mgwirizano Coalition elected its 
leadership, Malewezi declared himself an independent 
presidential candidate and took PPM-founder Jimmy 
Koriea-Mpatsa (who was sidelined in the election of PPM\'s 
leadership) as his running mate.  President Muluzi, along 
with the media, condemned their actions as \"power hungry\" and 
\"opportunistic.\"  On March 22, PPM announced that Malewezi 
and Koriea-Mpatsa\'s decision to stand as independents 
violated the party\'s constitution, and the party revoked 
their membership.  With the press reporting that many PPM 
members still support Malewezi, PPM has announced that all 
members must declare their allegiance to party. 
 
4. (C) In a March 11 meeting with the Ambassador, Malewezi 
said there were several reasons why he decided to run for the 
presidency as an independent.  Detailing his qualifications, 
Malewezi explained he had served with excellence for over 20 
years in the civil service under both former 
President-for-Life Dr. Banda\'s administration and Muluzi\'s 
multi-party democracy.  From his government service, Malewezi 
said, \"There isn\'t a village in Malawi that doesn\'t know my 
name.\"  Noting that he was from the largest ethnic group in 
the country and had a royal background, Malewezi also said he 
was respected as a chief amongst traditional authorities and 
has good relations with the highly influential churches. 
Malewezi, however, hung his campaign hopes on what he termed 
Malawi\'s \"parochial society\" attitude that it was not right 
what the UDF was doing to him by not selecting him to be the 
party\'s presidential candidate and that the presidency was 
rightfully his after 10 years of service as the Vice 
President.  Malewezi said this \"reservoir of goodwill\" from 
the people and his \"good reputation\" were the driving forces 
behind his decision to contest and would lead him to victory 
at the May 18 elections. 
 
5. (U) In addition to his presidential bid, Malewezi is 
contesting for the parliamentary seat in his home district of 
Ntchisi North-East.  (NOTE: The Electoral Commission 
currently has Malewezi listed as a candidate on the PPM 
ticket.  It is uncertain how the Electoral Commission and PPM 
will resolve this matter, as the deadline to change party 
affiliations on the Commission\'s official roster has passed.) 
 
LEGAL WOES 
---------- 
6. (SBU) In mid-February, the GOM filed a new legal action 
against Malewezi, claiming that by \"implication of his own 
conduct\" Malewezi resigned from the Vice Presidency and that 
government should have the right to appoint a new First Vice 
President.  After the Court\'s dismissal of the GOM\'s first 
application of prosecution in January and denial of an 
expedited trial on the second application in March, 
government hired a private lawyer to strengthen the Attorney 
General\'s legal team.  The courts have agreed that without an 
expedited hearing, the matter is unlikely to be resolved 
before the May 18 elections, making the immediate case a mute 
point.  However, the High Court Judge assigned to the case 
said a verdict will answer an important constitutional 
question about vice presidential succession that should be 
answered regardless of timing.  A trial date has not yet been 
set. 
 
7. (C) Government has seized and/or frozen all resources 
normally allocated to the Vice President.  Malewezi told the 
Ambassador on March 11 that the GOM had seized the vice 
presidential vehicles (four in total), claiming that Malewezi 
was illegally using the government vehicles for partisan 
activities.  Malewezi also said as Vice President his monthly 
salary and allowances normally amounted to roughly USD 3,700, 
but he was now receiving less than USD 400 per month.  At 
present, Malewezi also resides in his private home in Likuni, 
rather than in a government-owned house. 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (C) If Malawian technocrats and the donor community could 
vote, Malewezi would win the presidency hands down.  However, 
with his recent political missteps and bad timing, it is 
unlikely he will fare well in the presidential elections.

SUBJECT: INFLUENCE ANALYSIS - MALAWI 
 
REF: STATE 33359 
 
1.  (SBU) The information environment in Malawi 
has changed drastically in the ten years since 
multi-party democracy was instituted.  During 
the previous 30-year regime of President for 
Life Hastings Banda, the information environment 
was completely closed.  All news was censored 
and freedom of speech did not exist.  Today, 
freedom of speech is a right that is exercised 
and the private media is largely free.  State- 
run media still exists, however, and the Malawi 
Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) radio is the only 
medium that reaches the entire population. 
State-run television, initiated in 1999, reaches 
the urban elite.  Both are tightly controlled by 
the government and focus on ruling party news. 
MBC remains the main source of media news for 
most Malawians and due to low literacy and 
education rates, accessing information from 
other sources is difficult, thus making it a 
challenge for most people to make informed 
choices. 
 
2.  (SBU) Private media is an important part of 
the information environment.  Two daily 
newspapers (circulation approx. 15,000), read 
mostly by the urban elite, are considered to be 
independent and influential (although as 
politics change, the level of influence by the 
government over the editorial policies and the 
slant of the papers change also).  One 
opposition weekly is held in high regard by the 
public and takes pride in its investigative 
journalism.  An assortment of weekly papers 
appears, sometimes irregularly, and all are 
mouthpieces of certain parties or the government 
and are not highly regarded as influential. 
Private electronic media are the most 
independent media in Malawi and are increasingly 
influential.  Although the broadcasts are 
restricted to Lilongwe and Blantyre and 
surrounding areas, the influence is felt 
throughout the country.  Capital Radio, 
established in 1999, airs daily call-in talk 
shows on a variety of political and social 
issues - a first for Malawi. Capital is also the 
VOA affiliate.  Community and religious 
stations, a popular music station and a 
university station round out the electronic 
media - all are influential with their 
respective audiences.  BBC broadcasts to most of 
Malawi as well, but its influence is less than 
local stations and it only broadcasts in 
English. 
 
3.  (SBU) Other than the media, the most 
important source of public influence in Malawi 
are the religious institutions.  Internet 
availability is minimal, telephone service is 
restricted to the elite, much of the population 
is illiterate and other sources of information 
are not available.  Most people are highly 
religious, however, and churches and mosques 
play an important role in society.  Faith 
leaders have taken an active role in politics 
and were instrumental in bringing down the 
regime of Hastings Banda.  Faith leaders lead 
their flocks spiritually and politically. 
Churches and mosques are community centers as 
well as places of worship and offer an important 
center for information exchange. 
 
4. (SBU) NGOs, academics, schools, traditional 
leaders and donors also influence public 
opinion.  Malawi is extremely donor-dependent 
and thus the population and the government place 
great importance on the opinion of the donors. 
The NGO community is growing, but is still not 
organized or established enough to be a force on 
its own.  Academics are often relied on to 
comment on political issues, but their influence 
as academics is not significant.  Many academics 
also have political aspirations or connections, 
however, so that their opinions are sought on 
various levels.  Primary and secondary schools 
influence the youth.  Village chiefs and other 
traditional authorities are important influences 
at the village level. 
 
5. (SBU) For democracy and governance MPP goals, 
a variety of groups are targeted. Personal 
contact remains the most effective way to reach 
the opinion-makers, especially because the pool 
of influential decision-makers is relatively 
limited.  Demarches are used with government 
officials, but targeted exchanges, invitations 
to representational events and invitations to 
attend or take part in U.S. Speaker programs are 
also effective.  Individual dialogue with faith 
leaders and NGOs is important.  Outreach through 
the media, using op-eds, live or recorded 
interviews or placement of Washington-produced 
materials, can be effective in communicating 
with most democracy and governance 
interlocutors, such as churches, mosques, 
government officials, political parties, 
parliament, the military and the media itself. 
Information dissemination - using electronic 
journals, post-produced products or access to 
American Corners - is an effective means of 
communicating with many groups in this category. 
The U.S Speaker program, cultural programs and 
radio programs are important means of 
communicating with youth audiences, such as 
secondary or university students. 
 
6.  (SBU) For economic development MPP goals, 
the business community is an important target 
audience.  The main approach to the private 
sector is through the Ambassador\'s Quarterly 
Business Lunch, which serves as a de facto 
American Chamber of Commerce.  The Malawi 
Federated Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the 
Economists Association of Malawi, the Trade 
Policy National Working Group and the National 
Action Group are the important players in 
economic development.  The influence of labor 
leaders is far less than in the past, largely 
due to the lack of organization and cohesion in 
the labor movement.  Contacts with private 
businesses, outreach through electronic 
journals, radio, visits from U.S. companies and 
the U.S. speaker program are all used in 
outreach efforts.  Key government institutions, 
such as the Reserve Bank and the Ministry of 
Finance, are most often approached with either 
an official demarche or an invitation to a 
representational event. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Global health goals target government 
organizations and NGOs. The health NGO network 
is becoming more organized, and workshops, 
information sharing and partnerships are 
effective ways of communicating and cooperating. 
Government organizations, including the National 
AIDS Commission, work closely with NGOs and 
donors.  They are usually best reached by direct 
contact and cooperation in the form of technical 
assistance.  Media has proved useful in 
addressing mass audiences and the youth, 
particularly with HIV/AIDS messages.  Schools 
are also an important outlet for communicating 
with younger audiences. 
 
8. (SBU) Public diplomacy is used to implement 
and reinforce the above goals.  Target groups 
consist of a broad spectrum of the Malawi public 
and government.  U.S. Speaker programs, 
interactive dialogues, the media, information 
dissemination, workshops and personal contact 
are all used to further MPP goals.  Public 
diplomacy has specifically targeted Muslim 
audiences through personal outreach, radio and 
the U.S. Speaker program.  Workshops that have 
focused on biotech, HIV/AIDS, lobbying and the 
media have all been effective.  Radio and 
television appearances by Mission staff and 
visiting speakers are superb ways to reach a 
large audience.  The Public Affairs Section 
quarterly newsletter is widely distributed and 
is another outreach tool.

NACALA CORRIDOR 
 
REF: LILONGWE 199 
 
Classified By: POLOFF KIERA EMMONS FOR REASONS 1.5 b & d 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY.  The International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) is seeking to open a permanent office in Malawi. 
According to visiting IOM representatives, international 
human trafficking from Malawi and Mozambique via the Nacala 
corridor is the IOM\'s \"most pressing (trafficking in persons) 
concern in the SADC region\".  While we have some doubts about 
IOM\'s data, we welcome the opportunity to learn more about 
trafficking in persons issues in Malawi. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) At a March 24 meeting, IOM representatives 
Hans-Petter Boe and Jonathan Martens told Poloff IOM\'s intent 
to open an office in Lilongwe is a result of Malawi\'s 
location along the \"superhighway\" of human trafficking: the 
Nacala Corridor.  (NOTE: Post views the \"superhighway\" 
characterization with skepticism, since the Nacala Corridor 
is primarily a freight route with sporadic and incomplete 
passenger service. Neither is Nacala a favored road outlet, 
and the low volume of goods going through the port is 
routinely cited as an impediment to its use by Malawi\'s 
exporters. END NOTE) When pressed, the IOM representatives 
described Nacala as the primary transit zone for smugglers 
heading to South Africa and beyond, and described Nacala\'s 
deepwater port as a \"haven\" for traffickers of all sorts, 
referring to the area\'s history of piracy and slave trading. 
 
3. (C) Citing Malawi and Mozambique as IOM\'s areas of highest 
concern in the region, Boe and Martens described their three 
day visit to Malawi as a \"scouting\" trip. In meetings with 
various GOM ministries, they said they\'d encountered varying 
responses when presenting the issue of human trafficking as 
significant in Malawi; some officials expressed disbelief and 
denial, others offered anecdotal evidence that trafficking is 
on the increase and expressed frustration at the lack of 
action taken by the GOM.  All, however, had some level of 
awareness of TIP in Malawi, and said any assistance to combat 
the problem would be welcome. None offered any suggestion as 
to where the GOM would find IOM\'s 10,000 USD annual 
membership fee. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT.  Post finds IOM\'s Malawi-specific expertise 
to be limited. Boe and Martens\' remarks regarding the Nacala 
Corridor in particular portray the need for IOM to deepen its 
knowledge of the issue in Malawi.  While a 2003 IOM report 
which was researched and compiled by contractors with little 
experience in Malawi has garnered much attention, post has 
been unable to corroborate much of the anecdotal evidence 
therein.  A general lack of GOM resources combined with a 
lack of awareness about human trafficking has contributed to 
a \"no news is good news\" mentality within the GOM, and 
discussions of the issue are infrequent (reftel). In this 
regard, post believes an IOM office in Malawi would likely 
result in increased awareness and serve as a strong advocate 
to combat the problem.

in cabinet-level positions to 46.  In addition to the 
serendipitous creation of the new ministry just after Ntaba\'s 
announcement of support, the fact that there are fewer than 
3,000 people employed in the formal mining sector in Malawi 
demonstrates that the new position was created for purposes 
of political patronage. 
 
3. (SBU) Although Ntaba does not command a large following, 
he does have some support in the Central Region.  With his 
inclusion, President Muluzi has successfully garnered support 
for his hand-picked successor Bingu wa Mutharika from 
regional political figures in all three regions.

Summary 
------- 
1.  (C)  Malawi has made progress on its macroeconomic 
stabilization program, but it is unclear if that progress 
will be enough for the Executive Board to approve further 
disbursements, IMF Mission Chief to Malawi John Green told 
donors on March 23.  Behind the scenes, an IMF staff member 
told Pol/Econoffs that the team\'s objective for its mission 
was to package a program that was a technically defensible 
way to disburse money without creating a precedent for 
exceptional disbursements to other countries.  The GOM has 
made some structural progress as part of its program, but 
fresh revelations about poor elections budget implementation 
and improper grain handling pose significant threats to the 
GOM\'s agreement with the IMF.  In upcoming meetings with IMF 
staff, we recommend USG officials probe for information on 
the program\'s sustainability and effectiveness in dealing 
with Malawi\'s biggest macroeconomic threat -- its burgeoning 
domestic debt.  End summary. 
 
Another Statistic-Free Outbrief by the IMF 
------------------------------------------ 
2.  (SBU) IMF Mission Chief for Malawi John Green gave 
assembled donor Chiefs of Mission a ten-minute, nearly 
statistic-free outbrief about Malawi\'s Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Facility (PRGF) performance on March 23. Green stated 
that while the GOM\'s performance had not looked strong in 
November, he had good news: \"nearly all\" fiscal targets had 
been met for mid- to end-February, and the government is now 
focusing on its economic program.  On structural conditions, 
Green stated that \"many had been met, while some had not,\" 
and that \"the team hopes it will be enough\" for the program 
to go forward.  He stated that the team would tell the 
Executive Board that there has been clear progress, and 
rhetorically asked and answered, \"Will this be enough?  I 
don\'t know.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) Asked to elaborate, Green ran through structural 
criteria that had been due by end-December.  Completed items 
included approval of a wage policy, completion of a public 
service pension scheme, and the hiring of a pay policy 
advisor (which was delayed, but had been accomplished March 
22).  Two wage policy conditions had not been met, but one 
(presumably the consolidation of civil service allowances 
into the GOM salary structure) was \"too ambitious.\"  (The 
other unmet condition appears to be the establishment of a 
public service renumeration board.)  On the two contentious 
conditions that had been turned into prior actions, Green 
stated that the submission to Parliament of the \"compromise\" 
amendment to the Corrupt Practices Act (ref A) appeared to 
satisfy the prior action, and that the Anti-Corruption 
Bureau\'s (ACB) report on the National Food Reserve Agency 
(NFRA) was \"almost done.\"  (Note: Green chose his words 
carefully.  While the GOM\'s actions on the Corrupt Practices 
Act do appear to satisfy the IMF\'s prior action language, 
they would not have satisfied the originial second review 
condition.) 
 
4.  (SBU) Green stated that the GOM \"met almost all of its 
quantitative criteria for its September targets,\" although it 
had missed its net domestic assets target \"by a small 
margin.\"  Shifting to December targets, he stated that 
government borrowing \"missed by a large margin,\" due mainly 
to delayed disbursements by donors, higher resulting interest 
payments on the domestic debt, and inaccurate IMF projections 
on interest rate reductions.  \"We have to mention\" that GOM 
spending was higher than budgeted, he added, but so were 
revenues. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Green finished with the information that the IMF 
and GOM had established new targets under the supplementary 
budget, and that he was \"pretty sure\" that the fourth quarter 
would see net domestic debt repayment. 
 
6.  (C) Green did not raise how the GOM would achieve 
domestic debt reduction in FY2004/05, which he had identified 
in a March 15 donor inbrief as a critical issue.  \"The 
problem with next year,\" he said on March 15, \"is that the 
numbers do not add up if the objective is debt repayment.\" 
Green then floated that there would be a gap of 3% of GDP 
between what donors are expected to give to Malawi and the 
resources required for meaningful debt reduction -- an 
estimate which he quickly backed off and qualified as 
speculative.  Interestingly, Green refused during the donor 
inbrief to comment on the current size of more than MK 3 
billion \"statistical discrepancy\" between expenditure and 
financing numbers the IMF had found in the GOM\'s early 2004 
submission, saying that he had been \"chastised\" for revealing 
too much to donors.  His closer holding of information about 
performance was matched by the GOM, which clearly cracked 
down on access to numbers during the visit.  Even the Reserve 
Bank of Malawi\'s Director of Research and Statistics, usually 
a well-placed source on these discussions, was asked to leave 
discussions deemed sensitive.  Only the senior-most 
management remained. 
 
IMF Staff Member: \"It\'s a political decision....\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
7.  (SBU) IMF Team Economist Cecilia Mongrut visited 
Pol/Econoffs on March 17 as part of the staff\'s efforts to 
forecast bilateral donor inflows over the next year and to 
look for the extra 3% of GDP (around $60 million) loosely 
posited by Green as necessary for meaningful debt reduction. 
Mongrut arrived at the Embassy knowing that the USG does not 
give direct budgetary assistance to the GOM, but recalled 
that the Embassy had provided useful background and context 
on GOM actions and asked to use the meeting to discuss GOM 
structural performance, emerging rumors of improper handling 
of maize reserves, and overall economic trends. 
 
8.  (SBU) Pol/Econoffs briefed Mongrut, extensively covering 
observations about performance on the structural conditions 
and on prior actions, but also touching on the fiscal and 
monetary programs and on the real economy.  In great detail, 
Emboffs discussed the importance of the ACB\'s report on NFRA 
performance, given the four similar reports on corruption in 
the maize sector that the GOM has buried during the past two 
years and their large, negative fiscal impact on the IMF 
program (ref C).  Mongrut took notes on the various maize 
corruption cases, but offered little specific on GOM 
performance other than that, when bilateral disbursements did 
not appear in late-2003, the GOM did not cut its expenditures 
as required by its program.  When domestic revenues went up, 
she stated that the GOM spent the unexpected monies instead 
of applying them to higher-than-expected interest charges. 
 
9.  (C) As the meeting wound down, Mongrut appeared tired of 
discussing program specifics and spoke more generally about 
Malawi.  (Please strictly protect.)  \"We\'re working on the 
program up here,\" she said, pointing to an imaginary 
document, \"but it comes down to a political decision here,\" 
and motioned underneath the hypothetical document.  Presented 
with the Embassy view that Malawi needs aid to address 
poverty, but that the current cycle (contrived program 
targets, followed by missed, then relaxed criteria, with new, 
tougher, contrived targets proposed) has taught GOM officials 
to disregard program requirements and created a 
counter-productive long-term dynamic, she demurred.  She 
explained that the team was looking for a way to craft a 
technical program that was defensible, because the IMF 
worries about its country-by-country treatment.  \"The point 
is,\" she concluded, \"not to present a program that is an 
(humanitarian) exception, because other countries would then 
ask for exceptions, too,\" and she implied that the team had 
been tasked to find a way to make Malawi\'s program and its 
numbers work. 
 
Recent Developments: Maize, Election Problems Surface 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
10.  (SBU) As reported in ref A, the GOM successfully passed 
a supplementary budget during its March session along with 
the \"compromise\" amendment to the Corrupt Practices Act. 
Both actions appear to satisfy IMF prior actions.  Work on 
the comprehensive audit of arrears continues, with more than 
twenty auditors reportedly working on ten ministries, but 
contacts at the EU (please protect) believe the audit will 
drag out longer than forecast and not be done before end-May. 
 (Note: The auditors have reportedly asked for more time and 
resources, but it is not clear whether the request signals 
something about cooperation, the magnitude of arrears, or 
simply that the technical difficulty of the records search 
was underestimated.) 
 
11.  (SBU) Of greater concern, the Malawi Electoral 
Commission (MEC), with which the donors painstakingly put 
together an aid-supported elections budget in 2003, has 
announced that it cannot stick to its $14.6 million 
allocation and requires an additional $10 million (presumably 
from the donors) to carry out May\'s presidential and 
parliamentary elections.  Upon investigation, it has become 
clear that (along with unbudgeted expenditures for an 
extended registration period) the MEC spent unbudgeted funds 
on vehicles and that expensive allowances and \"emoluments\" 
that had been removed from the original budget have been 
re-inserted.  When the MEC proposal to the donors got a 
chilly reception, it turned to the Treasury for more money, a 
request not factored into the supplementary budget. 
 
12.  (SBU) In another example, shortly before the IMF team 
arrived in Malawi, President Muluzi responded to constituent 
complaints about a lack of maize in some areas by announcing 
in a public rally that grain parastatal ADMARC depots would 
receive shipments within five days.  The GOM subsequently 
distributed thousands of tons of maize from the Strategic 
Grain Reserve (SGR) and from commercial stocks outside of the 
channels that have been set up to avoid the maize corruption 
scandals of the past few years.  This was in direct 
contravention of an agreement made by the GOM with the 
donors.  At least 30,000 tons appear to have been taken out 
of the Strategic Grain Reserve, with another 40,000 tons 
taken from commercial stocks, all of which are being sold at 
the heavily subsidized price of MK 10 per kilo.  This has led 
to an outcry in the donor community, and donor experts have 
not been satisfied with Ministry of Finance explanations of 
how the SGR will be replenished and how the stocks will be 
paid for.  Information on the maize movements continues to 
surface, and the Embassy has no firm estimates of the costs. 
World Bank Country Manager Dunstan Wai told Pol/Econoff on 
April 1, however, that the IMF had discussed with the GOM 
shifting MK 1.4 billion ($13 million) in associated expenses 
to the 2004/05 budget. 
 
Comment 
------- 
13.  (C) Malawi\'s case is a difficult one.  Delays and heavy 
pressure have sometimes resulted in relative performance 
improvements; some officials within the GOM are focusing on 
the economic program; and some progress on structural 
conditions has been made since November.  (The IMF has given 
us too little to make an informed judgment about recent 
fiscal and monetary performance.)  We continue to see, 
however, a lack of commitment to the program at senior 
political levels, and, as the Mission has documented, 
performance improvements have evaporated in the past as soon 
as it looks like funds will be disbursed -- which appears to 
be happening again.  No one wants to get in the way of 
Malawi\'s third presidential and parliamentary elections, and 
the maize is already gone from its silos, leaving its 
magnitude-as-yet-unknown fiscal impact behind.  Which leads 
us to the conclusion that new, fungible disbursements from 
the World Bank and Fund would most likely be applied to 
unbudgeted maize and election expenses, minimizing the 
disbursements\' potential to move Malawi out of its debt 
spiral. 
 
14.  (C) Comment continued.  We understand that the IMF staff 
will soon be briefing USG agencies in Washington on Malawi\'s 
recent performance.  We would urge those meeting with staff 
to probe deeply on the  program\'s sustainability and the 
likelihood that domestic debt will be reduced.  With 
elections just weeks away, we believe that further 
information on those topics will be key to USG 
decision-making before Malawi\'s case comes before the 
Executive Board.

SUBJECT: SITUATION REPORT 28: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN 
MALAWI STABLE, BUT COULD DETERIORATE POST-HARVEST 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  THIS IS A JOINT USAID/DCHA-USAID/MALAWI 
REPORTING CABLE.  FROM MARCH 26-31, TWO FFP OFFICERS, OFDA 
REGIONAL ADVISOR, AND USAID/MALAWI AGRICULTURAL ADVISOR 
PARTICIPATED IN THE ONGOING VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT (VAC) 
IN MALAWI.  DESPITE THIS TIME PERIOD BEING THE HEIGHT OF 
THE HUNGER SEASON, THE CURRENT HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN 
MALAWI SEEMS TO BE STABLE.  HOWEVER, SUMMER CROP PROSPECTS 
IN MANY AREAS OF SOUTHERN MALAWI ARE POOR, POTENTIALLY 
LEADING TO RENEWED HUMANITARIAN NEEDS DURING THE 2004-2005 
HUNGER SEASON.  PRODUCTION IN NORTHERN/CENTRAL MOZAMBIQUE, 
WHERE MANY MALAWIANS ARE CURRENTLY PERFORMING CASUAL LABOR 
AND BUYING MAIZE, WILL ALSO IMPACT BORDER AREAS IN 
CHIKWAWA AND NSANJE DISTRICTS.  AS THE ISSUE OF FOOD 
SECURITY BECOMES INCREASINGLY POLITICAL WITH THE APPROACH 
OF ELECTIONS, DONOR FRUSTRATION IS MOUNTING FOLLOWING THE 
IMPROPER RELEASE OF 30,000 MT OF MAIZE FROM THE GOM\'S 
STRATEGIC RESERVES TO THE PARASTATAL, ADMARC.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT 
------------------------ 
2. From March 26-31, USAID staff traveled with two of the 
four VAC teams to assess food security prospects for the 
coming year in Malawi.  The teams are conducting 
interviews with staff from the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Irrigation, and Food Security (MOAIFS) and communities in 
vulnerable districts throughout the country.  Their 
primary data will be combined with secondary data from a 
variety of sources to provide the likely scenario for the 
coming months.  Members of the VAC come from various 
organizations, including three GOM ministries or offices, 
FAO, WFP, FEWS, and several NGOs.  The VAC uses the 
household food economy approach and is led by Save the 
Children/UK, a recognized expert in this methodology. 
 
3. USAID staff traveled to the most vulnerable districts 
of southern Malawi: Chikwawa and Nsanje (Lower Shire); and 
Zomba, Chiradzulu, Mangochi, and Machinga (Shire 
Highlands).  In general, the team concluded that the 
current situation is stable, particularly as last year\'s 
harvest was improved over previous years.  However, the 
upcoming summer harvest in these areas is extremely 
concerning.  Selected communities across all wealth groups 
consistently anticipated much reduced yields due to the 
late onset of the rains and prolonged drought conditions. 
As previously reported, the main rains were delayed in 
southern Malawi by more than two months this year, 
resulting in late or multiple plantings.  However, the 
rains ended in early March in most areas, thus leaving 
crops to wilt during a critical stage of growth.  Should 
the rains recommence now, most farmers still anticipate 
only a minor possibility of harvesting some sorghum and 
millet. 
 
4. As a result, the team anticipates that the 2004-2005 
hunger season will begin earlier than usual (as early as 
July) and could substantially impact the poorest 
households with little ability to cope.  However, the 
severity of impact will depend upon numerous factors, such 
as winter production prospects and the situation in 
surrounding parts of Mozambique.  Many farmers in these 
areas plant winter crops in wetlands along the Shire 
River.  Others without access to wetlands depend upon 
\"ganyu\" opportunities in Malawi and Mozambique to 
supplement their food production.  Communities already 
anticipate that winter production will be reduced due to 
low water levels in the wetlands.  Some communities are 
already employing coping mechanisms such as selling off 
assets, gathering firewood, and consuming wild foods. 
 
5. However, the conditions decribed above are not 
representative of the country-wide situation.  The VAC 
report will consolidate the findings of all teams and 
should be better able to highlight food security status 
for the coming year.  The report will be released by the 
end of April.  In addition, the Crop and Food Supply 
Assessment Mission (CFSAM) is scheduled for the end of 
April and will be able to determine crop production at the 
time of harvest. 
 
----------------- 
REPEATED MISTAKES 
----------------- 
6. As previously reported, ADMARC continues to sell maize 
at subsidized prices (10 MK/kg) well below those of the 
world market.  Such sales are not targeted to those who 
need it most.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that private 
traders are purchasing the subsidized maize (when it is 
available) and reselling it to communities for a profit. 
In most southern areas, current prices are 20 MK/kg and 
higher. 
 
7.  Once ADMARC depots ran out of commercial stocks in 
February, the GOM issued a directive on March 6 that 
ADMARC depots must have a supply within five days.  Thus, 
the GOM ordered the National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA) to 
release 30,000 MT from the strategic reserves for ADMARC 
depots.  Such a release violated the rules established by 
the NFRA Technical Committee, including the regulation 
that bidders must provide a bank guarantee for purchases. 
Donors were furious with these actions, prompting an 
apology from the GOM published in The Nation on March 27. 
However, the damage is done and such actions eerily mirror 
those of three years ago when the GOM sold off its 
reserves prior to the last crisis. 
 
--------- 
NUTRITION 
--------- 
8. Overall, the nutrition situation in Malawi is 
relatively stable.  Nutritional surveys conducted in five 
districts of Malawi between December and February found 
global acute malnutrition (GAM) rates of less than 3 
percent.  However, a concerning amount of oedema was 
observed in the surveys, potentially in part due to lack 
of dietary diversity. 
 
9.  Various NGOs have also conducted rapid MUAC screening 
to identify areas of concern.  The main areas of concern 
include parts of Nsanje, Chikwawa, Mwanza, and Lilongwe 
Districts.  Several GOM Nutritional Rehabilitation Units 
(NRUs) have reported increased numbers of admissions. 
WFP, Concern Worldwide, and World Vision are conducting 
supplementary feeding in some of these areas, and the OFDA- 
funded CoGuard consortium is planning supplementary 
distributions as needed in April.  Nutrition activities 
are being coordinated through the Targeted Nutrition 
Programs (TNP) working group chaired by the Ministry of 
Health and UNICEF. 
 
------------------------------ 
STATUS OF DISASTER DECLARATION 
------------------------------ 
10. According to USAID/Malawi, talk within the GOM of 
declaring a disaster seems to have died down in the last 
couple of weeks.  However, incentive to declare a disaster 
remains high with upcoming elections slated for May 18. 
Food security continues to be an issue debated in the 
national press and discussed at political rallies.  The US 
Mission has agreed to advise DCHA/OFDA of any change in 
the situation and to contact the Southern Africa Regional 
Office (SARO) prior to making any official declaration.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) Ineffectiveness and inefficiency have marked the 
Malawi Electoral Commission\'s (MEC) preparations for the May 
18 elections.  One million \"extra\" names on the official 
voting roster, overexpenditures resulting in a 26% increase 
in the elections budget, and failure to assure equitable 
coverage by the state-owned media are issues MEC has not yet 
resolved.  These issues, along with concerns about polling 
logistics, have been apparent since the January registration 
period ended, and MEC has done little to rectify them.  As 
international observers arrive and elections debate 
intensifies, time is running out for MEC.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ONE MILLION \"EXTRA\" REGISTERED VOTERS 
------------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) After completing the initial processing of 
registration forms, the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) 
announced the official rolls have 6.6 million registered 
voters.  The National Statistics Office (NSO) subsequently 
stated that the estimated voting-age population of Malawi is 
5.5 million.  When queried about the one million \"extra\" 
names on the rolls (assuming a full 100% of eligible voters 
registered), MEC officials publicly conceded that their 
figures may be inflated by the inclusion of deceased voters, 
voter transfers, and underage registrants on the rolls 
(reftel B).  MEC hopes registered voters and political party 
officials will help \"clean up\" the voter rolls during the 
verification process on April 28 and 30.  However, opposition 
parties and civil society leaders, noting the verification 
process was supposed to last a full week and was to have been 
completed by now, have argued that two days are insufficient 
for the rolls to be accurately verified, and they have 
suggested the inflated numbers are evidence of rigging. 
 
26% INCREASE IN ELECTIONS BUDGET 
-------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) As of mid-March, it became clear that MEC had 
overspent its original budget of USD 14.6 million, and so it 
initiated a round of meetings with the Ministry of Finance 
(MOF) and the donor community to approve a new budget of USD 
25 million.  Negotiations eventually produced a new budget of 
USD 18.4 million, a 26% increase from the original.  While 
MEC has asked the donor community and MOF to \"sign on\" to the 
new budget, it has received no firm commitments of new 
funding.  The donor community, which has provided almost USD 
6 million in elections support, is unwilling to offer any 
substantial new assistance.  It is unclear at this time how 
the GOM will make up the shortfall. 
 
UNEQUAL COVERAGE BY STATE-OWNED MEDIA 
------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Since the official campaign period began on March 
20, state-owned radio and TV, the only media with national 
reach, have provided the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) 
with highly unequal access to airtime.  According to the MEC 
Media Monitoring Unit, which produces weekly reports on media 
coverage of political parties, the ratio of 
ruling-to-opposition party overall coverage by Malawi 
Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) radio was 19-to-1.  For TV 
Malawi (TVM), it was 5-to-1. 
 
5.  (SBU) The MEC Media Monitoring Unit has made its media 
analysis public, but only at the insistence of the donor 
community.  MEC officials, while reluctantly acknowledging a 
problem of media access exists, say they are powerless to 
force the media houses to comply with the elections 
legislation that requires MBC and TVM to provide equitable 
access to political parties.  Civil society and opposition 
parties have repeatedly raised these concerns with MEC and 
say the MEC has the authority to ensure compliance, and the 
opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has filed 
lawsuits against MEC, MBC, and TVM. 
 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVATIONS 
-------------------------- 
6. (U) The European Union Elections Observation Team arrived 
on April 6, and at an April 8 press conference said that 
their initial observations were that opposition parties 
lacked access to public media and that the ruling UDF 
appeared to be using state resources in its campaign.  These 
observations, the EU Team said, would appear in their final 
report on the election\'s overall freeness and fairness.  SADC 
Parliamentary Forum and British Commonwealth Secretariat 
Observer Teams are also scheduled to observe the elections. 
 
HAPLESS CONSULTATIVE FORUM MEETING 
---------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) At an April 19 National Elections Consultative Forum 
(NECOF) meeting, civil society, political parties, and other 
interested groups questioned MEC on the voter rolls, the 
elections budget, and opposition access to media.  MEC, MBC, 
TVM, and ruling UDF officials gave derisory responses, and 
the meeting deteriorated into an unproductive verbal shouting 
match. 
 
MEC\'S INTERNAL TROUBLES 
----------------------- 
8. (SBU) In addition to its other operational troubles, MEC 
suspended Chief Elections Officer George Chimwaza on April 13 
for using MEC vehicles to support his wife\'s parliamentary 
campaign.  Chimwaza has been replaced by Roosevelt Gondwe, 
Clerk of Parliament currently seconded to MEC. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9. (SBU) Gondwe is a capable civil servant, and his 
substitution for the ineffectual Chimwaza is a welcome 
change.  With less than a month to go before the elections, 
however, the challenges of removing the \"extra\" million 
voters on the rolls, of finding a fix for the MEC\'s budgetary 
problems, and of bringing efficiency to the organization may 
be insurmountable.  END COMMENT.

1. (U) President Muluzi warned international election 
observers not to interfere in the electoral process at a

3. (SBU) Muluzi is unlikely to ask any international 
observers to leave the country because of the international 
political fallout that would ensue.  He likely made his 
statements to lay the foundation to discredit the EU Team\'s 
final report, which will surely include statements about the 
lack of a level playing field in the electoral process.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) The Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) confirmed on May 
5 that presidential and parliamentary elections will take 
place on May 18 in spite of continuing difficulties with the 
voters\' roll, a flawed verification process, and a 
significant funding gap.  On the political scene, a 
last-ditch clergy-led attempt at uniting the opposition to 
field a single presidential candidate was unsuccessful.  The 
Mgwirizano Coalition presidential candidate Gwanda 
Chakuamba\'s campaign is gaining steam, as criticism mounts 
against front-runner Bingu wa Mutharika of the ruling United 
Democratic Front (UDF).  While the MEC is likely to muddle 
through the elections, the run-up to polling day has been 
marred by inequitable access to the state-owned media.  In 
addition, some voters may be disenfranchised by the MEC\'s 
administrative incompetence.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE LAST DONOR-MEC MEETING 
-------------------------- 
2. (SBU) Donor Chiefs of Missions and the Malawi Electoral 
Commission (MEC) met on May 5 to discuss final election 
preparations, the voters\' roll verification process, and 
continued problems with the budget.  The MEC was represented 
by Chair Justice James Kalaile and Chief Elections Officer 
Roosevelt Gondwe. 
 
A FLAWED VERIFICATION PROCESS AND ITS REMEDY 
-------------------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) Gondwe conceded that the verification process, which 
was supposed to allow voters and new registrants to confirm 
that their information had been properly updated, \"was not a 
successful exercise.\"  He concluded there was low voter 
turnout because people knew the roster available in voting 
centers was the one from the 1999 elections, not an updated 
version.  Recognizing that the process failed, Gondwe said 
the updated, computerized rosters would be distributed to 
voting centers on May 11 and would be available for 
inspection until polling day.  The preparation of the updated 
roster, Gondwe said, has been greatly expedited by new 
computer support recently brought in from South Africa.  No 
provisions have been made, however, to deal with the at least 
one million extra names on the voters\' roll (reftel C). 
 
A BUDGET WITHOUT BUCKS 
---------------------- 
4. (SBU) Kalaile confirmed that the elections budget remains 
USD 18.4 million.  He, however, noted that new expenditures 
of USD 105,000 for South African computer support and USD 
500,000 for political party monitoring training were not 
reflected in the current budget.  Representatives from the 
Ministry of Finance have \"verbally committed\" to pay for the 
computer support, but there is still USD 3.5 to 4 million in 
expected spending beyond MEC resources.  The GOM again 
appealed to the donors to provide additional financial 
support, but all -- again -- declined to do so.  Speaking 
about the funding gap, Kalaile told poloff the GOM \"will just 
have to run a deficit that will be made up in next year\'s 
budget.\" 
 
MULUZI\'S ALLEGATIONS AGAINST EU OBSERVERS \"BASELESS\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
5. (SBU) Kalaile characterized as \"baseless\" President 
Muluzi\'s accusations that the EU Observer Team had been 
\"decampaigning\" the UDF government (reftel B).  Upon hearing 
the President\'s allegations, Kalaile said the MEC made 
inquires into the situation and \"found no evidence\" of 
improper behavior by the EU Observers. 
 
A FINAL, FAILED ATTEMPT AT OPPOSITION UNIFICATION 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
6. (SBU) In a last-ditch attempt to persuade opposition 
parties to field one presidential candidate, church leaders 
hosted April 26-27 talks among the National Democratic 
Alliance\'s (NDA) Brown Mpinganjira, Malawi Congress Party\'s 
(MCP) John Tembo, independent presidential candidate Justin 
Malewezi, and the Mgwirizano Coalition led by Gwanda 
Chakuamba.  Although the opposition leaders were unable to 
agree to a unified ticket, they released a joint statement 
calling on Kalaile to correct the voters\' roll, implement a 
proper verification process, stop the UDF from using public 
resources in its campaign, and rectify the state-owned 
media\'s bias in favor of the ruling UDF.  The statement 
demanded that Kalaile \"address these concerns within seven 
days or he should resign to allow a more capable person to 
preside over the coming elections.\"  (COMMENT: Although the 
call for Kalaile\'s resignation was hyperbolic, the concerns 
expressed are genuine.  The MEC\'s decision to make the 
voters\' roll available in voting centers on May 11, which has 
not yet been publicly announced, may be a result of the 
opposition leaders\' press statement.) 
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
--------------------- 
7. (SBU) Gwanda Chakuamba\'s presidential campaign as the 
Mgwirizano Coalition presidential candidate has gained 
momentum.  Independent newspapers and public polls indicate 
that Chakuamba is running a strong campaign.  Chakuamba\'s 
recent gains, however, have not extended to the Mgwirizano 
Coalition parliamentary candidates, who remain disorganized 
and largely loyal to their respective parties rather than to 
the Coalition. 
 
8. (SBU) While Chakuamba\'s campaign is gaining steam, Bingu 
wa Mutharika and the ruling UDF have come under greater 
scrutiny after a high-level COMESA report surfaced about 
Mutharika\'s 1997 firing from the position of COMESA Secretary 
General.  The report details misuse of funds, leadership 
incompetence, and a GOM-orchestrated sack.  While Mutharika\'s 
departure from COMESA has been publicly known since Mutharika 
was selected as the UDF\'s presidential candidate, it has only 
recently become a major campaign issue. 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
PROSPECTS OF FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS 
------------------------------------ 
9. (C) It is clear that the fairness of the electoral process 
has been compromised by inequitable access to the state-owned 
media.  In addition, logistical problems with the 
administration of the vote, and the more than one million 
extra names on the voters\' roll could potentially lead to 
voting fraud.  While Malawians may end up accepting the 
elections, these concerns cannot be ignored in assessing the 
elections\' credibility. 
 
10. (C) The sudden declaration that the elections will occur 
on May 18, which two weeks ago was declared an impossible 
task, is likely a political decision made due to the recent 
success of Chakuamba\'s campaign and the growing questions 
about Mutharika.  With Mutharika\'s superior access to 
resources and the state-owned media, however, the election is 
still his to lose.  END COMMENT.

REF: A. LILONGWE 245 
 
     B. LILONGWE 1 
 
1. (U) The High Court dismissed on May 4 the GOM\'s case 
against VP Justin Malewezi, in which government sought 
Malewezi\'s dismissal for resigning from the ruling United 
Democratic Front (UDF) and the right to appoint a new First 
Vice President (reftel A).  In the ruling, the panel of three 
judges found the Attorney General did not have the authority 
to refer constitutional disputes to the courts and that such 
authority resides only in the powers of the presidency.  The 
ruling further elaborated that if the President did bring the 
matter to the courts, there would be no defendant in the 
case, as it would be a matter of judicial interpretation. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
2. (U) The ruling, in effect, confirms that opposition 
presidential candidate Malewezi as Malawi\'s First Vice 
President.  With less than two weeks to go before the 
elections, it is unlikely that government will pursue the 
matter further.  Malewezi may counter sue for benefits that 
have been denied him, as the GOM has tried to squeeze him 
financially and get him to \"voluntarily\" resign.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) The Malawian Electoral Commission (MEC) announced 
the newly \"cleaned-up\" voters\' roll has been reduced by 
nearly one million names, and publicly acknowledged the 
state-owned media houses\' clear bias for the ruling United 
Democratic Front (UDF).  Unsatisfied with the progress on the 
voters\' roll, the Mgwirizano Coalition has filed a lawsuit 
against MEC, UDF, and the Attorney General for failure to 
comply with the legally mandated 21 days between the voters\' 
roll verification and polling day.  Meanwhile, the Catholic 
churches have reminded their 4 million faithful to evaluate 
presidential candidates based on their track records and to 
vote accordingly.  END SUMMARY. 
 
5.7 MILLION VOTERS 
------------------ 
2. (U) MEC announced on May 6 that the updated voters\' roll 
has 5.7 million voters, following a clean-up by a South 
African computer firm.  The reduction from 6.6 million 
voters, Chief Elections Officer Roosevelt Gondwe said, is a 
result of removing double registrants who re-registered 
rather than filing requests for transfer.  The new number is 
much closer to the National Statistical Office\'s projected 
voter age population of 5.5 million. 
 
MEC DECLARES STATE-OWNED MEDIA COVERAGE BIASED 
--------------------------------------------- - 
3. (U) MEC Chair Justice James Kalaile told SADC 
Parliamentary Forum (SADC-PF) Elections Observers on May 6 
that state-owned media houses Malawi Broadcasting Corporation 
(MBC) and Television Malawi (TVM) have not provided equitable 
coverage to all political parties.  Citing reports from the 
MEC\'s Media Monitoring Unit that indicate a clear bias in 
favor of the ruling party, Kalaile said: \"Previous elections 
were fairly covered because the management of MBC and TVM 
cooperated well with MEC then.\" 
 
COALITION SUES OVER VERIFICATION PROCESS AND VOTERS\' ROLL 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
4. (U) The Mgwirizano Coalition filed a lawsuit on May 5 
against MEC, UDF, and the Attorney General for failure to 
provide the legally mandated 21 days between verification of 
the voters\' roll and polling day.  The lawsuit, which also 
seeks redress for the UDF\'s use of public resources to 
campaign, requests that the courts seize the extra ballots 
that are no longer necessary because of the voters\' roll 
reductions, as MEC had 7.4 million ballots printed.  The 
court proceedings will begin on May 12.  (NOTE: A similar 
abridgment of the verification period in 1999 resulted in 
one-month postponement of the elections.) 
 
5. (U) The Coalition\'s lawsuits follows a separate lawsuit by 
the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) against MEC and the 
state-owned media houses for biased coverage in favor of the 
ruling UDF (reftel B).  The ruling is expected May 14, two 
days before the official campaign period is scheduled to end. 
 
GUIDING THEIR FLOCKS 
-------------------- 
6. (U) To provide guidance to Malawi\'s 4 million Catholics, 
priests re-read at May 9 masses the November Pastoral Letter 
entitled \"Reconsidering the Future of Our Country: Genuine 
Change Required.\"  The letter, while not overtly supporting 
any political party, asks followers to evaluate leaders on 
their track records and to vote accordingly.  In the call for 
change, some priests reportedly said Malawi does not \"need an 
economic technician or somebody coming from a party which is 
preaching that this year\'s elections are not about changing 
government.  We need someone who can change this country.\" 
The media has reported the Catholic Church\'s statements as 
anti-UDF. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. (SBU) There is no question that most churches, 
particularly the dominant Catholics and Presbyterians, are 
against the ruling UDF and Mutharika.  However, they have not 
demonstrated support for any one individual in opposition. 
In the absence of clear direction, the opposition vote will 
remain divided.

TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, EFIN, KDEM, MI, Political Issues, Corruption 
SUBJECT: GOM AGAIN CO-OPTS LABOR UNION; \"APPOINTS\" ILO 
REPRESENTATIVE 
 
1. (U) At Labor Day festivities on May 1, President Muluzi 
appointed Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU) President 
Sunduzwayo Madise, who was recently convicted of corruption, 
as Malawi\'s \"representative\" to the International Labor 
Organization (ILO).  Muluzi also donated MK 10 million (USD 
95,000) to MCTU and instructed government to find a building 
for the umbrella union to use, as it cannot afford its 
current rent. 
 
2. (U) While ostensibly supporting the principles of fair 
labor practices, Muluzi said: \"Unions are not enemies of the 
government.  When they get help from government, they should 
not be seen as having been bought.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (SBU) Apparently uninformed about ILO operations, Muluzi 
appointed Madise as Malawi\'s \"representative to the ILO,\" a 
position which does not exist, rather than as Labor Attache 
in Brussels, as Malawi has not had diplomatic representation 
in Geneva since 1994.  Opposition parties have condemned the 
move, saying that with Malawi\'s current budgetary problems, 
the government should be reducing the number of its 
diplomatic missions.  Muluzi has also been criticized for 
making the eleventh hour appointment so close to the May 18 
general elections when his term expires.  Many perceive the 
appointment as a payback for Madise keeping Malawi\'s largest 
union quiescent. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED: Muluzi\'s politically-motivated 
appointment of the MCTU President and his \"government help\" 
for the union, while clearly prompted by the approaching 
elections, typify the GOM\'s interference in union activities. 
 The once robust labor movement, which played an influential 
role in Malawi\'s 1994 transition to multi-party democracy, 
has been crippled by internal disputes, much of which has 
been inspired by meddling from the highest levels of 
government.  END COMMENT. 
 
BIO NOTE: Sunduzwayo Madise 
--------------------------- 
5. (U) Madise was convicted on two counts of corruption in 
November 2001 and was fined MK 50,000 (USD 500).  He was 
found guilty of accepting a USD 4,000 bribe from Global 
African Football Incorporated (GAF) consultant Ian Riley to 
award the television firm rights to air a Malawi-South Africa 
World Cup soccer match.  Madise also wrongfully allowed Riley 
to pay hotel bills amounting to USD 400. 
 
6. (SBU) Madise was elected MCTU President in January 2004 
amid great controversy and calls for a re-vote.  Madise\'s 
position was further challenged in February 2004, when the 
Ministry of Labor ordered Madise to leave the position 
because Malawian law enjoins convicted criminals from holding 
union offices.  The matter has been referred to the courts, 
and in the meantime Madise has been acting as the MCTU\'s 
president.

1. (SBU) Presbyterian Church Synod Moderator Reverend Felix 
Chingota, speaking on behalf of the Presbyterian clergy in 
Malawi, told poloff that the Presbyterian Church has begun 
telling its approximately 3.5 million members that \"it has 
difficulties with the United Democratic Front (UDF), and it 
would prefer a change in government.\"  Chingota said that 
although the clergy has come out publicly against the UDF and 
Mutharika, it does not plan to tell its congregations which 
opposition leader they should vote for. 
 
2. (SBU) The Presbyterian clergy\'s newly public anti-UDF 
stance comes as UDF presidential candidate Bingu wa Mutharika 
attempts to defend himself against opposition claims that he 
was fired from the COMESA Secretary Generalship for 
corruption and mismanagement (reftel B).  Mutharika announced 
on May 10 that he plans to take legal action against the two 
newspapers that reported the \"devious fabrication\" and the 
Mgwirizano Coalition leaders Gwanda Chakuamba and Sam Kandodo 
Banda who have repeated the story.  The two newspapers have 
announced that they stand by their stories and have no 
intention of making retractions.  Opposition parties continue 
to push Mutharika for satisfactory answers to the allegations. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (SBU) Although the Catholic Church has been less public 
with its anti-UDF message, it is significant that both the 
Presbyterian and Catholic Churches, which played a central 
role in bringing down the Banda regime, have come out against 
the UDF and Mutharika.  Considering the influence of the 
churches, this is not good news for the UDF.

REF: A. 03 LILONGWE 1202 
 
     B. LILONGWE 375 
     C. LILONGWE 381 
 
1. (U) As the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) began 
distributing ballots on May 12, opposition parties expressed 
grave concerns about the MEC\'s distribution of all 7.3 
million ballots, rather than a reduced number based on the 
updated voters\' roll of 5.7 million (reftel C).  According to 
MEC Chair Justice James Kalaile, MEC does not have adequate 
time to re-allocate and re-package ballots based on the new 
voters\' roll numbers.  To ensure the proper management of the 
ballots, Kalaile said political parties will have the 
opportunity to inspect ballots once they arrive at district 
offices.  Unsatisfied by MEC\'s provisions to prevent rigging, 
political party representatives and civil society leaders 
continue to advocate for the extra ballots to be either 
destroyed or kept in a secure location. 
 
2. (U) MEC officials also denied requests for an analysis of 
the computerized voters\' roll at the parliamentary district 
and polling station levels, which was requested because of 
suspicions that the number of voters in opposition 
parliamentary districts may have been wrongly reduced.  MEC 
officials said they will only release the district level 
statistics about the number of voters removed from the 
original voters\' roll of 6.6 million.  Opposition leaders are 
concerned that opposition areas within certain districts may 
have unfairly treated in the clean-up process. 
 
3. (U) As complaints and skepticism about the voters\' roll 
mount, the courts began hearing on May 12 the Mgwirizano 
Coalition\'s legal petition for postponement of the elections 
until a proper clean-up of the voters\' roll can be completed 
in order to allow the mandated 21 days inspection before 
polling day (reftel C).  A ruling is expected May 14. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
4. (SBU) Continued problems with the voters\' roll and the 
extra ballots at voting centers give rise to legitimate 
concerns of potential rigging.  With ballots already 
distributed though, a postponement of the elections could 
open the process to other problems.  That, along with the 
lateness of the hour, would make a judicial decision to 
postpone a risky and costly move.

SUBJECT: ELECTORAL COMMISSION ADMITS BIAS BY STATE MEDIA 
 
REF: 03 LILONGWE 1202 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  At a bruising meeting convened by donor 
chiefs of mission on May 11 with representatives of the 
Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) and the directors-general 
of state-controlled radio and television, the Commission 
itself acknowledged that election coverage has been heavily 
biased in favor of the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) 
party.  According to one Commissioner, by not providing a 
level playing field, the state-run media knowingly 
contravened accepted agreements and guidelines.  With only 
days remaining before polling day on May 18, inequitable 
coverage of the opposition has already tarnished the 
elections and will certainly cause them to be assessed as 
less than fully free and fair.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) When confronted with weekly reports by the MEC 
Media Monitoring Units indicating blatant imbalance in their 
coverage of the elections, the directors-general of the 
Malawi Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) and Television Malawi 
(TVM) cursorily offered up a very tepid defense.  Instead, 
they blamed the Electoral Commission for not forcing them to 
follow rules they themselves had previously agreed to. 
(Note:  When the director-general of MBC said he had never 
received any guidance, the head of the Media Monitoring Unit 
produced a letter signed by the director-general 
acknowledging receipt of the guidelines and his agreement to 
follow them.  End note.)  One of the two Commissioners 
present responded with a stinging rebuke that MBC and TVM had 
been publicly and privately notified many times of their 
flaunting of the guidelines. 
 
3.  (SBU) One political party has sued MBC, TVM, and the 
Electoral Commission over the unfair media coverage.  The 
case is pending in the courts, and a ruling is expected May 
16.  The Electoral Commission itself had chided both MBC and 
TVM on May 3 for not following media rules and guidelines 
during the campaign, but later that week withdrew the 
allegations and apologized. 
 
4.  (SBU) Comment:  Since MBC is the only medium to reach the 
entire population, fair and accurate election information has 
been denied to a large percentage of Malawi\'s predominantly 
rural population.  Accordingly, the USG, the UK, the EU, and 
other donors have already made it known to the GOM that the 
state-owned media\'s coverage has been unacceptable and, no 
matter what happens on polling day, will negatively affect 
the credibility of the elections.

SUBJECT: KWACHA SET TO TUMBLE AFTER ELECTIONS 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econoff Marc Dillard for reasons 1.5 b/d. 
 
1.  (C) Currently trading around 109 to the dollar, Malawi\'s 
kwacha is set to tumble after next week\'s elections, Reserve 
Bank of Malawi (RBM) Governor Elias Ngalande told 
Pol/Econoff.  Ngalande speculated that the kwacha will 
quickly depreciate to the range of 120-125. 
 
2.  (C) The RBM, which officially lets the kwacha float, is 
believed to have set an unofficial ceiling of 110 kwacha to 
the dollar in the run-up to the elections.  Smaller, more 
market-oriented foreign exchange bureaus have already 
signaled a depreciation, and there are credible reports that 
major banks are publishing a 108-109 rate in the newspapers 
but executing transactions above the 110 mark. 
 
3.  (C) Ngalande told Pol/Econoff and the British High 
Commissioner that he preferred to manage a gradual 
depreciation after the elections, and to that end, he pitched 
a plan in which the RBM would \"borrow\" from the High 
Commission\'s local pound account to push up published reserve 
holdings and (he argued) ward off speculators.  The High 
Commissioner, while sympathetic to the RBM\'s predicament and 
sensitive to a depreciation\'s effect on the poor, noted that 
the High Commission\'s local holdings are \"small beer\" in 
relation to national foreign exchange needs. 
 
Comment 
------- 
4.  (C) Ngalande\'s request to the British underscores the 
precariousness of Malawi\'s foreign exchange situation, as 
well as the political sensitivity of the dollar-kwacha 
exchange rate.  With Malawi\'s IMF program currently on hold, 
it also adds to the list of challenges the new government 
will face.

1. (SBU) Opposition presidential candidate and 
First Vice President Justin Malawezi\'s interview 
on state-owned Malawi Broadcast Corporation 
(MBC) was halted after only 15 minutes of an 
hour-long program.  Malawezi, formerly of the 
ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) but running 
as an independent, was criticizing the 
government for overspending, over taxation, and 
poor performance in relation to the Agriculture 
Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC). 
 
2. (SBU) According to the news anchor, the 
Assistant Controller of News entered the studio 
after the first 15 minutes and signaled for the 
program to stop.  The anchor told PAO he did not 
t 
immediately stop the program because he was 
confused by the interruption.  The Assistant 
Controller, speaking on a mobile phone with whom 
the anchor presumed was MBC\'s Deputy Director 
General, then went to the Controller of Programs 
seeking assistance in stopping the interview. 
At the Controller\'s insistence, the program was 
cut, and the radio station completed the hour 
with music.  (NOTE: The anchor told PAO that he 
fears he will be suspended for not stopping the 
program immediately after being told to do so. 
End note.) 
 
3. (SBU) Comment.  The muzzling of Malewezi by 
state radio does not come as a surprise.  The 
bias of MBC has been well-documented by the 
Malawi Electoral Commission\'s Media Monitoring 
Unit and by the independent press.  MBC, along 
with the UDF leadership, has been especially 
hard on Malewezi since his defection from the 
ruling party.  With four days until polling day, 
this latest incident is further proof of the 
lack of a level playing field in state-owned 
media.

SUBJECT: FREER, BUT POORER: MALAWI AFTER TEN YEARS OF 
DEMOCRACY 
 
REF: 03 LILONGWE 1202 
 
2004 Elections a Milestone for Malawi\'s Democracy 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
1.  (SBU) Summary and introduction: This month\'s presidential 
and parliamentary elections will mark ten years since 
Malawi\'s first democratic elections and the transition away 
from Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda\'s thirty-year dictatorship. 
Much has changed, for better and for worse, since the advent 
of \"multipartyism\" in 1994, and it is an appropriate time to 
take stock of Malawi\'s democratic development. 
 
2.  (SBU) One of our diplomatic colleagues summarized the 
past decade by saying that Malawians are \"freer, but poorer\" 
now.  We must agree.  The days of domestic intelligence 
officers monitoring social functions and the capricious 
jailing of political activists are long gone; they have been 
replaced by a remarkable openness among Malawians, both in 
person and in public.  The small private media are vibrant 
and enthusiastic.  The military remains impressively 
apolitical.  Accountability and oversight institutions, while 
weak, have survived, and a nascent civil society scored a 
major victory in 2003 when President Muluzi\'s bid to amend 
the constitution and extend his time in office was defeated. 
 
3.  (SBU) At the same time, the average Malawian is 
materially worse off today than in 1994. Per capita GDP, at 
$180, has stagnated.  Seasonal food shortages haunt the 
countryside, and the manufacturing sector has shrunk. 
Corruption, both official and petty, is on the rise. 
Maternal mortality has become significantly worse, nearly 
half of children suffer chronic malnutrition resulting in 
stunting, and HIV/AIDS and other diseases have lowered life 
expectancy from 45 (in 1987) to 39 years.  Although there has 
been some progress in addressing health concerns, behavior 
change is elusive, anti-retroviral drugs to treat those with 
AIDS have only recently become available to a tiny fraction 
of the HIV-infected, and the challenges of delivering more 
care are daunting.  Too often resigned to their economic and 
health \"fates,\" people show up to political rallies to 
receive cash handouts so they can buy some soap and perhaps a 
bit of sugar for their tea. 
 
4.  (SBU) Whither Malawi\'s democracy?  The lifting of decades 
of repression, deteriorating living standards, and HIV/AIDS\'s 
rending of the social fabric have led to a rise in crime and 
a certain lawlessness in political, economic, and social 
life.  Addressing this feeling of \"freedom without 
responsibility\" -- which pokes through at all levels of 
society -- will be a major challenge for the country\'s next 
ten years of democratic development, as will be the task of 
rebuilding the economy.  End summary and introduction. 
 
Political Life 
-------------- 
5.  (SBU) Democratic institutions and traditions in Malawi 
are fragile, and the transition to democracy is still very 
much a work in progress.  The executive branch exercises 
considerable authority over the legislature and judiciary; 
Parliament has trouble focusing its attention on pertinent 
and timely legislation; regional and personal loyalties trump 
ideas in party-building; and only some judges exhibit real 
independence.  With that said, Malawi\'s democratic 
consolidation has engaged civil society and the media, and 
human rights and freedoms are generally respected. More 
Malawians are actively participating in political and civic 
life, and popular support for the idea of a national 
democracy is strong (though not coupled to a grass-roots 
understanding of institutions or expectations of performance). 
 
6.  (SBU) The executive branch\'s disproportionate access to 
resources and corresponding influence, however, continues to 
define much of Malawi\'s politicking, precluding the normal 
checks and balances of a more mature democracy.  The 
President, with his absolute control over the size and 
composition of the Cabinet (bloated now to 46 members), is at 
the helm of a well-greased patronage machine that doles out 
Mercedes, luxury four-by-fours, government residences, 
first-class travel, numerous allowances, and various other 
\"personal emoluments\" to the favored.  Finance Ministers -- 
even backed by threats from the IMF -- have been unable to 
control the President\'s travel, state residences\' expenses, 
and discretionary budgets.  And the executive branch as a 
whole routinely overruns its budget, only sometimes seeking 
ex-post approval from Parliament through supplementary 
budgets.  In a significant change, however, 2003 saw 
Parliament\'s first open-floor challenge to the GOM\'s budget 
as presented by the Finance Minister, and, after several 
years of technical assistance, budget and finance oversight 
committees now seem more comfortable in reading and 
questioning budget line items. 
 
7.  (SBU) Other promising signs of incipient Parliamentary 
activism include a general increase in the quality of 
legislative committees, President Muluzi\'s inability to end 
his term limit through \"Open Term\" and \"Third Term\" bills in 
2002 and 2003, and opposition successes in blocking 
government-introduced legislation (such as late-2003 
proposals to amend an anti-corruption bill and the act 
governing the agricultural parastatal ADMARC) by pushing it 
to committee.  The opposition\'s new-found ability to stand in 
the way of legislation arose from the splintering in all 
political parties that occurred in the run-up to this year\'s 
elections, but the unprecedented number of independent 
candidates currently running -- and the almost certainty that 
no party will control a majority in the next parliament -- 
could conceivably consolidate that power into a major 
democratic gain.  Although such a consolidation is by no 
means assured, the judiciary\'s striking down of 
\"floor-crossing\" legislation, previously an effective tool 
for enforcing rigid party discipline, makes it more likely. 
 
8.  (SBU) Malawi is a highly litigious society, with suits, 
countersuits, injunctions, and counterinjunctions punctuating 
the daily life of politicians, businesspeople, and even 
sports figures.  Over-reliance on the courts reflects the 
basic fairness Malawians perceive in the judiciary, but it 
also indicates their frustrations with other, largely 
ineffective government institutions.  Several judges have 
shown admirable independence over the past ten years in 
high-profile and politically sensitive cases, and the 
judiciary\'s ability to rebuff parliamentary attempts in 2001 
to remove several independent judges was a major step 
forward.  Inefficiency, backlogs, and a lack of resources, 
however, commonly mar the system\'s ability to deliver timely 
justice. 
 
9.  (SBU) While judges have often shown their independence, 
the judicial system as a whole suffers from some political 
bias exerted through the office of the Director of Public 
Prosecutions (DPP).  Politically appointed and beholden to 
the President, the DPP has wide discretion over which cases 
to prosecute (including cases brought by the independent 
Anti-Corruption Bureau).  It is no coincidence that at least 
seven cases of corruption by ministers or other senior 
officials during the Muluzi decade have not been pursued by 
the DPP, while all the opposition presidential candidates 
(John Tembo, Gwanda Chakuamba, Brown Mpinganjira, and Justin 
Malewezi) have been prosecuted during the past three years. 
That none of the four has been found guilty simultaneously 
testifies both to judges\' independence and to the system\'s 
vulnerability to some political manipulation. 
 
Civic Participation and the Rule of Law 
--------------------------------------- 
10.  (SBU) The media environment in Malawi has changed 
drastically in the last ten years.  During the previous 
regime, the information environment was completely closed, 
all news was censored, and freedom of speech did not exist. 
Today, freedom of speech is a right that is exercised, and 
private media is largely free.  State-run media still exist, 
however, and are tightly controlled by the government. 
State-run Malawi Broadcasting Corporation (MBC radio) is the 
only medium that reaches the entire population; it remains 
the main source of formal news for most people.  MBC almost 
exclusively carries pro-government and pro-ruling party news. 
 Television Malawi, also state-owned and operated, reaches 
the urban elite and is heavily biased towards the government. 
 
11.  (SBU) A slew of private media outlets opened at the time 
of transition in 1994 and just as quickly were winnowed by 
the marketplace.  While fewer in number now -- and smaller 
than their state-run counterparts -- private media are 
playing an important, and growing, role in the information 
environment.  Two daily independent newspapers, one 
opposition weekly, and several private radio broadcasters 
carry largely unbiased news and are often critical of the 
government. Journalists have become more professional and 
investigative, and most private media, although lacking in 
resources, are committed to advancing freedom of expression. 
 
12.  (SBU) A nascent civil society has taken some advantage 
of the media environment, but much of the NGO community 
remains \"donor-centered\" rather than attuned to the political 
aspirations of average Malawians.  A few voices for 
accountability, transparency, and political activism stand 
out, but government initiatives to tax, corral, and arm-twist 
civil society are still tolerated and are therefore still 
effective.  Many of the most active NGOs are those with 
foreign funding and ties that serve as a counterweight to the 
government\'s bullying.  Churches, tied to foreigners but also 
deeply entwined with Malawi\'s history (including the 
churches\' pivotal role in the change to multi-party 
democracy), remain the most influential civil society force. 
Also noteworthy is the rapid rise of Islam and the 
proliferation of foreign-financed mosques, which are less 
visible than the churches but can sway opinion at the 
grass-roots level, especially in the south and along the 
lakeshore. 
 
13.  (SBU) When civil society does mobilize the population, 
as it did during President Muluzi\'s bid to end presidential 
term limits, it runs afoul of the police.  Deeply resistant 
to change despite an ambitious training program run by the 
British, the police (like most Malawians) appear to have 
difficulty distinguishing between the government of the day 
and the ruling party.  Officers remain somewhat intolerant of 
demonstrations and their crowd control tactics are often 
heavy-handed.  Aggressive police reaction to protests -- 
particularly those by students -- has provoked vandalism, 
which too easily escalates to the use of live ammunition and, 
occasionally, deaths.  Deaths of detainees in police custody 
have also provoked public outrage.  While a far cry from the 
enforcers of the Banda regime, the police still must develop 
the understanding that their primary relationship is to the 
populace -- rather than the government. 
 
14.  (SBU)  The Malawi Defense Force (MDF), in contrast, 
remains impressively professional and apolitical, and 
attempts to draw the army into the political arena continue 
to be swiftly and decisively rebuffed by senior military 
officials.  As one of the first African militaries to 
complete all six phases of the US-sponsored African Crisis 
Response Initiative (ACRI) and to sign on to the Africa 
Contingency Operations, Training, and Assistance (ACOTA) 
Program, the MDF plans to open a regional peacekeeping 
operations training school at its military college.  In the 
past decade, it has participated in peacekeeping missions to 
Rwanda, DRC, Liberia, and Kosovo, and it was first on the 
scene with humanitarian relief during Mozambican floods. 
 
Economic Development\'s Role 
--------------------------- 
15.  (SBU) Malawi is heavily donor-dependent, with bilateral 
and multi-lateral aid contributing around 40% to the 
government\'s budget.  The donor dependency that has evolved 
can verge on the absurd -- at the extreme, presidential 
candidates have campaigned on their ability to beg from the 
donors -- and that mentality, with its seeping assumption 
that action can only be initiated by the government or the 
donors, stands as one of the biggest obstacles to private 
sector-led economic growth and democratic maturation. 
 
16.  (SBU) Malawi\'s grinding poverty, chronic food 
insecurity, and a stagnant economy have robbed many of the 
luxury of participating in political life.  Not all is bleak: 
poverty reduction, at least on paper, is now the government\'s 
avowed priority, and significant infrastructure upgrades and 
structural reforms have begun to attract limited foreign 
investment.  The resulting improvements in banking and the 
retail grocery sector, for example, can already be seen in 
urban areas.  The benefits of reform will have to spread 
further, however, before they reach the average Malawian and 
create much-needed jobs. 
 
17.  (SBU) Beyond poverty\'s effects, the continued large role 
of parastatal organizations in Malawi\'s economy hinders 
democratic development.  Lucrative memberships on parastatal 
boards constitute the rolling stock of the government\'s gravy 
train, tying perhaps 600 of the elite to the President\'s 
power of appointment.  Worse, the parastatals are generally 
inefficient and drain the government\'s resources, raising the 
burden on the average taxpayer while dragging down the 
private sector.  In a significant success of the past decade, 
the government\'s privatization program has sold off more than 
half of approximately 110 parastatals targeted, but the 
remaining 50 or so companies -- many the largest and most 
politically sensitive -- must be addressed to reinvigorate 
the economy and reign in the executive\'s source of patronage 
and all-too-easy influence over key economic sectors.  If the 
challenge of creating an indigenous constituency for the 
private sector is simultaneously met, the long-term benefits 
to political and economic life will be magnified. 
 
18.  (SBU) In the short term, the next government will face 
significant difficulty in climbing out of the economic hole 
dug by the Muluzi government.  Ten years ago, the kwacha 
traded at four to the dollar; now it trades at just under 
110, and it is expected to depreciate further after the 
elections.  Three years of a rocky relationship with the IMF 
have also left the government with a non-functioning Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility, chronic government 
overspending, interest rates above 35%, and a domestic debt 
that has grown nearly fivefold since 2000.  The resulting 
macroeconomic environment is not conducive to growth, and 
rising interest payments have deeply cut into other 
government expenditures.  The debt is widely acknowledged as 
unsustainable, and it carries significant risk to overall 
macroeconomic stability.  The new government will have to 
address these problems to resume poverty reduction and 
support Malawi\'s long-term democratic development. 
 
19.  (SBU) Education and agriculture will also have to be 
addressed.  President Muluzi\'s United Democratic Front (UDF) 
instituted free universal education when it took power in 
1994, a move that was highly popular and long overdue. 
However, a lack of resources, a dearth of trained teachers, 
few educational materials, poor management and 
administration, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic have conspired to 
drastically lower education standards as access has increased 
to the system\'s lower levels.  At the higher levels, the two 
functioning universities have fees that are prohibitive for 
most Malawians, and entry requirements are more stringent 
than they were 10 years ago.  Given the ravages of HIV/AIDS, 
the needs for skilled workers at all levels have only 
increased in the meantime. 
 
20. (SBU) As for agriculture, Malawi today has more 
difficulty feeding itself than it did in 1994.  Much of the 
decline in food security stems from low productivity, a 
rapidly rising population, environmental and soil 
degradation, and the collapse of agricultural extension 
programs.  As most Malawians work the land, and many face a 
yearly \"hungry season,\" the agriculture sector has been a key 
failure in the past ten years, retarding development in other 
areas.  For some, it has even led to nostalgia for the 
certainties of the Banda era. 
 
Health, Corruption, and other Dangers 
------------------------------------- 
21.  (SBU) Malawi clearly faces a number of significant 
challenges, but it is also clear that it has made progress, 
albeit slowly, in consolidating its democracy over the past 
decade.  The largest threats to those gains are HIV/AIDS and 
corruption.  The biggest open question is what will happen 
with soon-to-be former President Muluzi. 
 
22.  (SBU) The potential for HIV/AIDS to reverse gains in 
developing countries is well-documented.  In Malawi\'s case, 
the general HIV prevalence is 14.4%, 50% of the army is 
reported to be infected, and thousands of vital civil 
servants -- such as police officers, teachers, nurses, and 
parliamentarians -- are dying.  The country\'s security, 
political stability, and economic future are at stake. 
Malawi was in the first tranche of recipients from the Global 
Fund for Aids, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and the $196 
million committed by the Global Fund, which has started to 
trickle in, will no doubt eventually bring some relief.  The 
money is just a down payment, though, on the enormous costs 
associated with prevention and care.  The USG\'s continued, 
aggressive engagement on HIV/AIDS will make a significant 
humanitarian difference while supporting our long-term goals 
of democratic and economic development. 
 
23.  (SBU) Corruption also poses a substantial and growing 
threat.  Though not yet in the league of Nigeria or Cameroon, 
Malawi is faced with a rise in both official and petty graft. 
 Its ratings from Transparency International have dropped, 
allegations of malfeasance played a role in Denmark\'s 2002 
breaking-off of multi-million dollar education and health 
programs, and corruption is a key concern for Malawi\'s 
potential access to Millennium Challenge Account funding. 
For Malawi\'s democratic development, the phenomenon has two 
particularly corrosive traits: fraud is rampant in the 
procurement, sale, and distribution of maize; and the 
shenanigans start from the very top. 
 
24.  (SBU) The fraud surrounding the purchase and sale of 
maize is notable because maize is a staple of both diet and 
politics in Malawi.  It is heavily subsidized; it is a large 
line item in the budget; and, notably, it is distributed at 
political rallies.  At least five separate investigations 
into a series of maize scandals have been initiated in the 
past three years, yet the results of all have been kept from 
the public.  It is widely understood in the diplomatic 
community that the tarnished include government ministers, 
parliamentarians, and prominent business people.  The scale 
of the theft, much of which has come during food shortages, 
has been grand, running into the tens of millions of dollars. 
 
 
25.  (SBU) It would be easy for an opposition government -- 
or a hand-picked successor looking for a way to establish his 
independence -- to launch into a series of corruption 
investigations and trials in the post-Muluzi period.  Whether 
maize or other corruption trials are brought forward or are 
suppressed, whether due process (versus political 
retribution) characterizes the proceedings, and how the 
public perceives those developments will all be important 
questions for determining which path Malawi\'s democracy is 
following.  Perhaps most important will be whether President 
Muluzi finds himself in court. 
 
26.  (SBU) President Muluzi entered office with a trading 
firm that was nearly bankrupt, two tobacco farms, and three 
houses in Blantyre.  He will leave a far, far richer man -- 
some say the richest man in the country.  Poor 
record-keeping, a system in which business interests can be 
easily hidden, and weak disclosure regulations keep the truth 
in the dark, but he is believed to own or have a major 
interest in a trading firm, sugar distributors, several 
farms, several houses, a real estate development corporation, 
a chain of grocery stores, a chain of gas stations, a major 
office complex now leased to the Malawi Revenue Authority, a 
national fertilizer supply chain, a few smaller office and 
shopping complexes, a professional soccer team, a mining 
firm, a radio station, and an international transport and 
trucking company.  He is the head of the quasi-public Bakili 
Muluzi Institute, and has started an eponymous HIV/AIDS 
foundation (which has already received, by questionable 
means, $50,000 in donor money).  He has also announced plans 
to open a self-financed investment bank and a television 
station.  His tentacles now touch much of Malawi\'s small 
economy. 
 
Whither Muluzi, Whither Malawi? 
------------------------------- 
27.  (SBU) Although he has stated publicly that he will tend 
to his businesses after stepping down from the presidency, 
President Muluzi will be a force in Malawi\'s politics for 
years to come.  He is an active sixty-one year old, and he 
has retained the Chairmanship of the United Democratic Front 
for himself (until now it has been held by the president). 
His older, hand-picked successor Bingu wa Mutharika (the 
current front-runner in the elections) owes his political 
standing to Muluzi, and Muluzi is legally eligible to run 
again for president in 2009.  Clearly, the outcome of this 
month\'s elections, and the successor government\'s 
relationship with Muluzi, will be crucial for Malawi\'s next 
decade of democratic development. 
 
28.  (SBU) More than Muluzi will matter, though.  All of the 
current presidential candidates came of age under 
President-for-Life Banda, and all were members of Banda\'s 
Malawi Congress Party.  All survived Banda\'s rough brand of 
politics, but not all will have political lives beyond these 
elections.  2004 will likely be John Tembo\'s and Gwanda 
Chakuamba\'s last shot at the presidency, and their departure 
from the political scene opens the possibility of another 
significant evolution.  The living memory, and imprint, of 
Banda recedes. 
 
29.  (SBU) Ten years ago, there was euphoria at the birth of 
multi-party democracy.  Progress has been slower than hoped, 
and more uneven, but there has been progress nonetheless. 
Malawi\'s poverty is so crushing, though, that many of the 
political and democratic gains cannot be enjoyed by the 
average citizen.  If the economy can be turned around, 
Malawians will be in a better position to appreciate -- and 
build upon -- the gains that have been made over the past 
decade.

1. (U) The High Court ruled on May 14 in favor of the 
Mgwirizano Coalition\'s request to postpone May 18 
presidential and parliamentary elections.  It decided on the 
grounds that the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) had not 
fulfilled the legal requirement to open the voters\' roll for 
public scrutiny at least 21 days before polling day (reftel 
D).  In the High Courts\' ruling, the panel of judges 
determined that the voters\' roll should be open to the public 
through May 19 and that polling day should occur no later 
than May 25.  MEC officials have informally told journalists 
that polling will likely occur on May 25.  (NOTE: According 
to the Constitution, MEC cannot delay the elections more than 
7 days without receiving a mandate from Parliament.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
2. (SBU) Other than fulfilling the legal requirements of the 
electoral law, postponing polling day will do little to fix 
the problems with the voters\' roll, since MEC will not have 
sufficient time to correct any errors noted during the 
verification process.  The opposition Coalition will likely 
welcome the postponement because there is the general feeling 
that its campaign has been gaining momentum in the recent 
weeks.

sometimes maybe too vibrant!\"). 
 
2. (C) Muluzi confirmed that presidential and parliamentary 
elections, which had been postponed from their original May 
18 date by a court order (reftel), will now take place on May 
20.  When the Ambassador commented that many people had 
speculated the new date would be May 25, Muluzi replied that 
elections needed to take place on May 20 since he had already 
invited other heads of state to an inauguration ceremony in 
Blantyre on May 24. 
 
3. (C) The Ambassador raised the urgency of Malawi signing 
the (long-delayed) Direct Agreement necessary for a $30 
million USD OPIC loan for rehabilitation of the Nacala 
Corridor.   Muluzi said he expected the Agreement would be 
signed on May 17.  (Post will report on Nacala septel.) 
 
4.  (C) Comment:  Though primarily a courtesy, Muluzi\'s call 
came amid the frantic end-game of an elections campaign, 
showing how strongly he values Malawi\'s relationship with the 
U.S.

1. (U) \"The Nation\" daily newspaper published a front-page 
story on May 17 questioning the authenticity of United 
Democratic Front (UDF) presidential candidate Bingu wa 
Mutharika\'s doctoral degree.  In a carefully constructed 
article, the newspaper points out that Mutharika\'s CV does 
not list the dates when he attended Pacific Western 
University (PWU), an American university where he claims to 
have obtained his Ph.D. in Development Economics.  The 
article also details information on diploma mills in the U.S. 
and indicates that a university with the same name is listed 
\"among 550 non-accredited American colleges and universities 
and colleges offering fake academic papers.\"  The story has 
been repeated in independent radio broadcasts. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
2. (SBU) The article artfully alleged, but did not say, that 
Mutharika bought his much ballyhooed degree from an American 
diploma mill.  This information, along with the reports of 
ineptitude and corruption while he led COMESA (reftel C), has 
been known by opposition leaders and independent media houses 
for some time.  That the stories would surface during the 
final, critical days of the campaign period appears planned. 
With the UDF campaigning Mutharika as the solution to 
Malawi\'s economic problems, these recent attacks on his 
credentials have done much to damage Mutharika\'s credibility, 
at least among the urban audiences with access to newspapers.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
1. (SBU) In a three-fold ruling on May 16, the High Court 
ordered that the presidential and parliamentary elections be 
postponed, that the 1.6 million ballots in excess of the new 
voters\' roll total be given to the High Court, and that 
President Muluzi stop using state resources to campaign. 
Since the court\'s ruling, the elections have been postponed 
to May 20, the Supreme Court has returned custody of the 
extra ballots to the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC), and 
the media and opposition allege that Muluzi is continuing to 
use state resources to campaign.  In a separate May 16 
ruling, the High Court dismissed for lack of evidence the 
National Democratic Alliance\'s (NDA) lawsuit against MEC and 
state-owned radio and television for coverage biased in favor 
of the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF).  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE HIGH COURT\'S THREE-FOLD RULING 
---------------------------------- 
2. (U) The High Court\'s May 16 ruling on the Mgwirizano 
Coalition\'s request to postpone the elections included three 
orders: one, MEC was ordered to continue verification of the 
voters\' roll through May 19 and to conduct elections between 
May 20 and May 25 (reftel C); two, MEC was ordered to 
surrender an appropriate number of ballots to reflect the 
reduced number of voters on the voters\' roll (reftel E); and 
three, President Muluzi was ordered to stop using state 
resources in the UDF\'s campaign for re-election. 
 
3. (U) Following the court order, MEC announced on May 16 
that the elections will be held on May 20 (reftel C).  The 
change in date will mean the official campaign period ends 
May 18 at 6:00 AM, and the official results will be announced 
May 22. 
 
4. (U) On the issue of custody of the excess ballots, MEC 
immediately appealed to retain custody of the ballots and the 
Supreme Court granted its request (reftel E).  Although the 
Supreme Court did not make a final determination on the 
appeal, the issue has become moot since MEC will have custody 
of all ballots through polling day.  MEC has determined it 
will leave ballots, which it began distributing on May 12, in 
voting centers despite the two-day postponement. 
 
5. (U) Citing as evidence weekend campaign visits to Blantyre 
and Mulanje using state vehicles and helicopters, independent 
media accuse Muluzi of \"ignoring\" the High Court\'s order to 
discontinue using state resources to campaign. 
 
MEDIA BIAS CASE DISMISSED DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
6. (U) In a separate ruling on May 14, the High Court 
dismissed the National Democratic Alliance\'s (NDA) lawsuit 
against the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) and the 
state-owned radio and television for coverage biased in favor 
of the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) (reftel D). 
According to the court ruling, \"The courts\' decision is 
limited to the evidence presented before them and most of the 
affidavits presented by the NDA were mere allegations that 
were not beefed up by evidence.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. (SBU) The bias in state-owned radio and television has 
been well documented by the MEC\'s Media Monitoring Unit, 
independent newspapers, and international elections 
observers.  In the ruling, the court stated that the 
appellants presented insufficient evidence during the case; 
it did not actually make a judgment on whether a bias 
existed.  Without such a determination, the issue of access 
to media could feature in a legal challenge of the elections.

Summary 
------- 
1.  (C/NF)  Taiwanese diplomats are worried that an 
opposition win in Malawi\'s upcoming presidential and 
parliamentary elections could result in Malawi breaking 
diplomatic relations, Second Secretary C.W. \"Albert\" Chang 
told Pol/Econoff.  Local Taiwanese officials avoid the 
opposition and channel some aid through mechanisms closely 
aligned with the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF), 
leaving many in opposition to perceive the Taiwanese as 
pro-UDF rather than as development partners with the country 
of Malawi.  Noting some recent PRC activity in Malawi, Chang 
made a pitch for closer local aid cooperation with the USG, 
so that the GOM might perceive cutting ties with Taiwan as 
threatening USG programs as well.  While we agree that the 
Taiwanese are seen as pro-UDF, we note that Taiwan managed a 
similar transition ten years ago, when it dropped its support 
of the dictator Hastings Banda and aligned with current 
President Muluzi.  The key to that transition (as will likely 
be the case again) was the cash Taiwan produced for the new 
government.  End summary. 
 
Taiwan Fears Change After Malawi\'s Election 
------------------------------------------- 
2.  (C/NF) Diplomats at the Taiwanese Embassy in Malawi are 
worried that a change in Malawi\'s government after May 20 
presidential and parliamentary elections could affect 
Malawi\'s diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, Second Secretary 
C.W. \"Albert\" Chang told Pol/Econoff on May 5.  The polls, 
which will be Malawi\'s third democratic elections, will bring 
with them a new president, as President Muluzi is 
constitutionally ineligible to run for a third term. 
 
3.  (C/NF) Chang had asked for the meeting ostensibly to 
discuss election prospects, because, he explained, Taiwanese 
diplomats have virtually no contact with opposition parties. 
He stated that their practice of avoiding the opposition was 
not a policy, but described it as \"well understood\" that 
officials should not meet with those outside the government. 
President Muluzi, he added, \"has pawns everywhere,\" including 
National Intelligence Bureau officers and other \"watchers.\" 
\"He would know if Taiwan met with the opposition, and he 
might cut ties.\"  (Note: Chang later stated that the 
Taiwanese Ambassador had frozen out a confidante, former 
Agriculture Minister Aleke Banda, when Banda defected from 
the ruling United Democratic Front.) 
 
4.  (C/NF) Because of Taiwan\'s contact practices, Chang told 
Pol/Econoff that many in the opposition associate Taiwan with 
the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) and would be 
inclined to court the PRC.  (Note: Taiwan\'s aid practices, 
which have included facilitating a Taiwanese NGO\'s support 
for a trust run by the first lady, as well as 
behind-the-scenes payments per ref A, re-inforce opposition 
perceptions of Taiwan supporting the UDF rather than Malawi.) 
 
Suspicions of PRC Activity in Malawi 
------------------------------------ 
5.  (C/NF) Unsurprisingly, Chang stated that the Taiwanese 
keep a close watch on suspected PRC activity in Malawi.  Over 
the course of the conversation, he noted the following: 
 
--A PRC company in the commercial capital Blantyre is 
constructing an office building on contract for the GOM. 
Chang stated that the Taiwanese Embassy suspects that 
undercover PRC officials have been placed among the company\'s 
management.  He stated that the Taiwanese had uncovered a 
similar arrangement with a PRC Foreign Affairs implant in a 
company \"in Nigeria or somewhere else in the West African 
region\" two years ago. 
 
--Current Minister of Housing K. Phumisa attended a 
conference in Beijing between one and two years ago (likely 
in previous incarnations as Minister of Information or 
Minister of Transportation).  How, Chang asked rhetorically, 
did he get invited? 
 
--A PRC television crew recently visited Malawi and toured 
the country extensively while making a documentary.  Chang 
stated that local PRC representation would have been needed 
to set up such a tour. 
 
6.  (C/NF) In possible connection to ref D request, Chang 
gently probed whether the USG had taken stock of PRC 
activities in Malawi and asked whether the USG had considered 
how changes in African recognition of Taiwan could affect 
Taiwan-PRC and US-Taiwan relations. 
 
Pitch for Closer Local US-Taiwan Cooperation 
-------------------------------------------- 
7.  (C/NF) Chang closed the meeting with a pitch for linking 
local USG and Taiwanese aid programs.  Such a link, he 
explained, would benefit Taiwan \"strategically,\" because the 
GOM would see severing ties with Taiwan as potentially 
threatening to USG programs as well. 
 
Comment 
------- 
8.  (C/NF) We wonder if Chang\'s reasoning for USG-Taiwanese 
aid cooperation is partly behind Taiwan\'s recent fervent 
attempts to link its local HIV/AIDS programs with CDC efforts 
(refs B and C).  As for Taiwanese fears about its official 
ties with Malawi, Taiwan managed a similar transition ten 
years ago from the thirty-year dictatorship of Hastings Banda 
to President Muluzi\'s UDF.  Malawi has a long history of 
selling diplomatic recognition to those willing to pay, and a 
successful transition would probably only be a matter of 
arranging for a large enough suitcase of cash.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) In a calm and orderly fashion, Malawians turned out 
to vote in Malawi\'s third democratic presidential and 
parliamentary elections on May 20.  A morning rush to the 
polls led to an afternoon lull, with only a few reports of 
minor violence.  Persistent problems with the voters\' roll 
and voter transfers caused delays and resulted in some 
legitimately registered voters not being allowed to vote. 
Noting a generally good administration of the polls, 
observers have questioned internal controls at some voting 
centers.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SOME DELAYS AT OPENING 
---------------------- 
2. (U) There have been reports that some centers were delayed 
in opening at the scheduled 6:00 AM because officials were 
not ready on time.  By 8:00 AM, it appears that polling 
stations were open and generally had all ballots and 
materials necessary for administering the vote. 
 
FEW REPORTS OF MINOR VIOLENCE 
----------------------------- 
3. (U) There have been a few reports of minor violence.  In 
Blantyre, a police officer and elections official were 
reportedly beaten because a crowd of people waiting to vote 
thought the ballot box had been filled with ballots before 
the center opened.  Electoral Commission investigations 
revealed that the ballots in the box were unused and all 
accounted for.  Voting at the center began around 11:00 AM 
and will extended until 11:00 PM. 
 
WEAK INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROBLEMS WITH VOTERS\' ROLL 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
4. (SBU) US Mission observers noted weak internal controls at 
some voting centers.  They found that some ballot boxes had 
not been properly sealed and that not all control forms had 
been filled out, both of which were supposed to be completed 
during opening procedures. (NOTE: Without the properly 
completed documentation, it will be difficult to verify that 
voting boxes have not been tampered with.) 
 
5. (SBU) Observers also noted that many registered voters 
were not listed on the computerized voters\' roll.  Elections 
officials consulted the 1999 register to find the missing 
individuals, which created delays at many centers.  When a 
voter was not found on either roll, the person was not 
allowed to vote.  There has also been a great deal of 
confusion about processing voter transfers.  These problems 
have frustrated and disenfranchised some legitimately 
registered voters. 
 
6. (SBU) In some centers, observers said, election officials 
did not mark on the voters\' roll which voters had voted, nor 
did they indicate which voters were verified by use of the 
1999 roll.  This lack of record-keeping could result in 
discrepancies between the number of ballots cast and the 
actual number of voters. 
 
7. (SBU) Other minor administrative hiccups have occurred, 
mostly involving inadequate materials.  The Malawi Electoral 
Commission has reportedly been replenishing centers suffering 
from shortages. 
 
VOTER TURNOUT 
------------- 
8. (U)  After a morning rush at the polls, voting centers 
were notably quieter in the afternoon.  As of mid-afternoon, 
observers report that around 50% of registered voters have 
voted and that election officials are ready for a flurry of 
last minute voters.  (NOTE: In the 1999 presidential 
elections, 92% of registered voters voted.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9. (SBU) Apart from expected disorganization at some centers 
and the serious problems with the voters\' roll, polling is 
proceeding relatively well.  The failure of many elections 
officials to follow internal control procedures is of concern 
as it could facilitate rigging.

1. (U) After 69 hours of counting, the Malawi Electoral 
Commission (MEC) announced on May 23 the results of the 
presidential and parliamentary elections.  Of the 5.7 million 
registered voters, MEC reports that 3.1 million voted 
(54.3%).  The inauguration is scheduled for the morning of 
May 24.  Post\'s assessment of the elections will follow 
septel. 
 
2. (U) Results of the presidential election are as follows: 
 
Bingu wa Mutharika - United Democratic Front (UDF): 1,119,738 
(35.9%) 
 
John Tembo - Malawi Congress Party (MCP): 846,457 (27.1%) 
 
Gwanda Chakuamba - Mgwirizano Coalition/Republican Party 
(RP): 802,386 (25.7%) 
 
Brown Mpinganjira - National Democratic Alliance (NDA): 
272,172 (8.7%) 
 
Justin Malewezi - Independent: 78,892 (2.5%) 
 
3. (U) In the parliamentary elections, nine political parties 
and 38 independents won seats in the National Assembly.  The 
MCP has a plurality with 59 seats.  The UDF, the former 
leading party in the house, won 49 seats.  Women won in 27 
parliamentary districts.  The numbers of seats by party is as 
follows: 
 
Malawi Congress Party (MCP): 59 
 
United Democratic Front (UDF): 49 
 
Republican Party (RP): 16 
 
National Democratic Alliance (NDA): 8 
 
Alliance for Democracy (AFORD): 6 
 
People\'s Progressive Movement (PPM): 6 
 
Movement for Genuine Democratic Change (MGODE): 3 
 
People\'s Transformation Party (PETRA): 1 
 
Congress for National Unity (CONU): 1 
 
Independents: 38 
 
(NOTE: For various reasons, parliamentary elections were not 
conducted in six parliamentary districts.  MEC will conduct 
by-elections in these constituencies.) 
 
4. (SBU) According to sources in MEC, the official results 
were tabulated based on \"unclean data,\" which had been 
received from District Officers with arithmetic errors. 
After internal arguments, MEC reportedly decided to go ahead 
and announce the results to allow inauguration preparations 
to continue and to fulfill its legal mandate to produce 
results within 72 hours after the polls closed.  MEC 
reportedly plans to release final results after it has had 
time to \"clean\" the data. 
 
5. (U) Leader of the opposition Coalition Gwanda Chakuamba 
has come out strongly against the results, signaling that he 
will contest the election results both politically and 
legally. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (SBU) MEC\'s handling of the tally process and release of 
results based on \"unclean\" data will certainly lead to a 
court challenge of the UDF\'s victory.  Both the Mgwirizano 
Coalition and MCP have announced their intention to seek 
legal redress for various \"irregularities\" in the electoral 
process.

REF: LILONGWE 438 
 
1. Delayed announcement of presidential and parliamentary 
election results sparked scattered demonstrations and 
violence in Blantyre and Mzuzu on May 23 (reftel).  The 
Mgwirizano Coalition, led by Gwanda Chakuamba, staged a 
demonstration in Blantyre to protest the Malawi Electoral 
Commission\'s (MEC) handling of the elections and the United 
Democratic Front\'s (UDF) victory.  When police attempted to 
disperse the demonstrators with tear gas and warning shots, 
opposition supporters reportedly torched the UDF\'s 
headquarters.  Some cars were also reportedly overturned 
before the demonstration was broken up.  No injuries or 
deaths have been reported. 
 
2. Tensions remain high as plans for Bingu wa Mutharika\'s 
inauguration proceed for the morning of May 24.  The high 
tensions and several visiting SADC heads of state have led to 
a heavy police presence in Blantyre.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) Commending the general peaceful conduct of the 
polls, international election observers nevertheless have 
noted substantial shortcomings in Malawi\'s presidential and 
parliamentary elections.  Among them, inequitable access to 
the state-owned media, the ruling party\'s use of state 
resources to campaign, and poor planning and administration 
by the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) feature most 
prominently.  These inadequacies, combined with a general 
feeling among voters of inability to effect political change, 
are the likely causes of a relatively low voter turnout.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OBSERVER TEAMS 
------------------------------------- 
2. (U) International election observer teams from the 
European Union (EU), the Commonwealth Secretariat (ComSec), 
the African Union (AU), the Electoral Institute of Southern 
Africa (EISA), and the Southern Africa Development Community 
Parliamentary Forum (SADC-PF) largely agreed in their 
assessments of Malawi\'s third democratic presidential and 
parliamentary elections.  While commending the peaceful 
conduct of the polls and the efforts of local elections 
officials, the teams noted a skewed playing field resulting 
from the ruling United Democratic Front\'s (UDF) use of the 
state-owned media and public resources to campaign and the 
poor administration of election logistics as undermining the 
conduct of the elections. 
 
INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE STATE-OWNED MEDIA 
------------------------------------------- 
3. (U) All observer teams noted that a level playing field 
did not exist because of the \"gross bias of the public media\" 
(ComSec) in favor of the ruling party and the near \"exclusion 
of opposition parties and independent candidates\" (EU) in 
news coverage, which the donor community flagged as a problem 
throughout the campaign period. The Malawi Electoral 
Commission (MEC) Media Monitoring Unit\'s final report, which 
assessed media coverage during the entire campaign period 
(March 20 to May 18), said that state-owned radio station, 
the only medium with national reach, accorded 92% of coverage 
to the ruling party; the state-owned television, 81%. 
 
RULING PARTY\'S USE OF STATE RESOURCES TO CAMPAIGN 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
4. (U) All observer teams also expressed concern with the 
\"widespread and overt distribution of money to voters and 
abuse of state resources by the ruling party\" 
(EU/AU/SADC-PF).  The \"misuse of the advantages of 
incumbency\" (ComSec) and the focus of campaigns on 
\"personalities and character assassination\" rather than on 
\"issues\" (AU) detracted from the equitable presentation of 
issues and policies during the campaign period. 
 
POOR ADMINISTRATION 
------------------- 
5. (U) The poor administration of elections logistics, 
especially the update of the voters\' roll, also featured 
highly in the shortcomings the teams noted.  The voter 
registration process was \"deficient\" and resulted in 
\"inflated voter registration figures\" (EISA).  The 
computerized cleanup of the voters\' roll was also 
\"unsatisfactory and resulted in considerable confusion and 
lack of confidence amongst voters\" (EU).  The problems with 
the voters\' roll also resulted in the disenfranchisement of 
some voters, though the numbers are unknown. 
 
6. (SBU) The tabulation and delayed announcement of results, 
which occurred only three hours before the legislative 
deadline of 72-hours after the polls closed, have also come 
under criticism by political parties and civil society 
groups.  There has been no evidence of outright rigging, but 
MEC\'s use of \"unclean data\" for the results is of concern 
(reftel D).  Two opposition parties have announced their 
complaints will be formalized in legal action against MEC. 
(NOTE: The delays in tabulation and announcement of results 
did not feature in the international observers\' preliminary 
findings because their reports came out before the election 
results.  Observer team representatives have said their final 
reports will include the issues caused by the delays. END 
NOTE.) 
 
LOW VOTER TURNOUT 
----------------- 
7. (U) 54% of registered voters cast ballots, which is 
markedly lower than the last presidential election\'s 92%. 
Theorizing about the low turnout, civil society leaders have 
said the late start of civic and voter education and a 
general feeling of inability to effect political change are 
likely reasons. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (SBU) We concur with the international observers\' 
assessment of the elections.  MEC\'s poor planning and 
administration, which led to innumerable irregularities, and 
its failure to ensure a level playing field in the run-up to 
the polls seriously undermined the conduct of the 
presidential and parliamentary elections.  Without a 
meaningful public discussion of the issues and without 
reasonable confidence in the Electoral Commission\'s handling 
of the process, the Malawi elections lacked some key elements 
of a fully democratic contest.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
1. (SBU) On the second day of the three-day gap between the 
close of polls and the announcement of election results, 
Mgwirizano Coalition leader Gwanda Chakuamba, acting without 
the Coalition\'s backing, announced on May 22 that he had won 
the presidential elections.  While claiming victory, 
Chakuamba accused the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) of 
delaying the tabulation and announcement of results so that 
it could rig the elections in the ruling United Democratic 
Front\'s (UDF) favor.  After MEC announced results on May 23, 
Chakuamba incited his supporters, and subsequent 
demonstrations in Blantyre and Mzuzu sparked violence that 
lasted through the May 24 inauguration of Bingu wa Mutharika 
(reftel B).  As tensions ease, the Coalition filed a legal 
challenge to the elections and is requesting the results be 
declared null and void. The Malawi Congress Party (MCP), led 
by John Tembo, has also stated that it plans to file suit 
against MEC because several pro-MCP areas were allegedly not 
included in the final tally of presidential results. 
Although the elections had notable irregularities and lacked 
some key elements of a fully democratic contest (reftel A), 
the margin of victory was such that there is no reason to 
think that Mutharika did not win.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CHAKUAMBA\'S BRAZEN ANNOUNCEMENT 
------------------------------- 
2. (U) On day two of the three-day gap between the close of 
polls and MEC\'s announcement of results, Mgwirizano Coalition 
leader Gwanda Chakuamba, who came in third place in the 
presidential election, announced on May 22 that he was the 
victor of the presidential contest.  His announcement was 
apparently made without the consent of the rest of the 
Coalition.  Coalition Deputy Aleke Banda reportedly would not 
sign Chakuamba\'s press release and advocated for more 
peaceful means of protesting the Electoral Commission\'s 
delays.  In his claim of victory, Chakuamba accused MEC of 
outright rigging during the tabulation of results and of 
administrative irregularities that led to the 
disenfranchisement of voters. 
 
3. (U) Upon the Electoral Commission\'s announcement of 
results, Chakuamba supporters demonstrated in Blantyre and 
Mzuzu, which provoked a heavy-handed response from the police 
(reftel B).  The unrest, which has subsided, lasted through 
Bingu wa Mutharika\'s inauguration late in the afternoon of 
May 24. 
 
THE COALITION\'S LEGAL PETITION 
------------------------------ 
4. (SBU) Bazuka Mhango, a senior member of the Coalition and 
a lawyer, told poloff that the Coalition officially filed a 
challenge of the election results at the High Court on May 
24, in accordance with legislation requiring petitions to be 
filed within 48 hours of the announcement of results.  In the 
petition, Mhango said, the Coalition is arguing that the 
elections had so many irregularities that \"no one can 
determine the true results\" and that the results should be 
declared null and void.  Mhango said the Chief Justice will 
set a court date when he meets with the lawyers presenting 
the case on the afternoon of May 25. 
 
MCP PLANS TO FILE SUIT 
---------------------- 
5. (SBU) The MCP has announced that it refuses to accept the 
presidential election results because it believes two 
districts from the pro-MCP area of Mchinji were not included 
in the totals announced by the Electoral Commission.  MCP 
Publicity Secretary Nicholas Dausi told poloff that party 
officials are collecting presidential election totals from 
their party monitors before they officially file suit at the 
High Court.  Dausi said party representatives have been in 
contact with MEC officials to ensure that their challenge 
fulfills all necessary legal requirements. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (SBU) Although the elections had notable irregularities 
and lacked some key elements of a fully democratic contest 
(reftel A), no election observers noted problems widespread 
enough to overcome Mutharika\'s 400,000 vote lead.  The 
opposition challenges of the elections results will be heard 
by the High Court, but are not likely to change the outcome 
of the presidential contest.

REF: A. LILONGWE 404 
 
     B. LILONGWE 438 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  (SBU)  Low voter turnout, a splintering of parties in 
Parliament, an unprecedented number of independent 
parliamentary victors, and the failure of eleven former 
cabinet members to win in the elections on May 20 showed an 
electorate deeply dissatisfied with the status quo.  While 
the majority (of those who bothered to turn out) voted 
against the UDF, it retains the presidency.  Building a 
parliamentary majority is the UDF\'s immediate challenge, and 
how the party attempts to meet that challenge will tell much 
about President Mutharika\'s standing among party leaders and 
with the opposition.  End summary. 
 
Voter Turnout Sharply Down; Majority Votes Against Winner 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
2.  (U) Despite long lines early on polling day, only 54% of 
Malawi\'s 5.7 million registered voters turned out for 
presidential and parliamentary elections on May 20.  That 
stands in sharp contrast to the last presidential elections 
in 1999, when 92% of registered voters cast ballots. 
 
3.  (U) As reported in ref B, the ruling United Democratic 
Front\'s (UDF) Bingu wa Mutharika was declared the winner of 
presidential elections with 35% of the vote.  More than 
two-thirds of votes went to opposition candidates, but they 
were split four ways.  The closest candidate, John Tembo of 
the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) received 27% of the vote, and 
Mgwirizano Coalition/Republican Party candidate Gwanda 
Chakuamba came in a close third with 26%. 
 
Number of Parties in Parliament Jumps 
------------------------------------- 
4.  (SBU) The year-long splintering of political parties that 
had marked the run-up to the elections (ref A) was reflected 
in the polls, and the number of parties represented in the 
National Assembly has jumped from four to nine.  With 
victories in 59 constituencies, the MCP won an (at least 
initial) plurality in the 193-seat legislature.  It was 
followed by the UDF (49), the Republican Party (16), the 
National Democratic Alliance (8), the Alliance for Democracy 
(6), the Movement for Genuine Democratic Change (3), the 
People\'s Transformation Party (1), and the Congress for 
National Unity (1).  Thirty-eight independents also won 
seats, and six seats remain vacant awaiting by-elections. 
(Note: Parliamentary victories by President Mutharika and 
Vice President Chilumpha will result in two more 
by-elections, which will likely be re-won by the UDF.) 
 
5.  (SBU) The results somewhat exaggerate the ruling party\'s 
parliamentary losses, because many of the 38 independent 
candidates had originally wished to stand for the UDF. 
Despite their apparent popularity at the district level, many 
of these aspirants were pushed aside by favorites of the 
UDF\'s senior leadership and had to run as independents.  At 
least one has already announced that she will return to the 
UDF fold, and others are being heavily courted. 
 
6.  (SBU) At the party-level, the Alliance for Democracy 
(AFORD) suffered the worst losses, dropping from the 33 seats 
it won in 1999 to six.  AFORD President Chakufwa Chihana\'s 
2003 decision to ally himself with former President Muluzi 
and the UDF broke the former powerhouse of the northern 
region into a rump AFORD and the opposition Movement for 
Genuine Democratic Change (MGODE).  Voters apparently also 
deserted AFORD for the Republican Party (RP) and the People\'s 
Progressive Movement (PPM). 
 
7.  (U) The National Democratic Alliance, which broke away 
from the UDF in 2000 to become a \"pressure group,\" solidified 
its standing in parliament with eight victories.  Four of 
those victories came in the southern district of Mulanje, 
home of NDA presidential candidate (and returning 
parliamentarian) Brown Mpinganjira.  Singer-turned-NDA 
candidate Billy Kaunda also won his seat. 
 
8.  (U) Other notable parliamentary victors included 
independent presidential candidate (and former vice president 
to Muluzi) Justin Malewezi, Mgwirizano Coalition vice 
presidential candidate Aleke Banda (a former UDF minister and 
founder who had defected from the party), and former 
President Muluzi\'s son Atupele. 
 
Former UDF/AFORD/NCD Cabinet Members Fall 
----------------------------------------- 
9.  (SBU) Eleven former cabinet members and several other 
UDF/AFORD alliance heavyweights fell during the elections. 
Former cabinet members who lost their parliamentary seats 
included Sam Mpasu (Minister of Commerce), Mary Banda 
(Minister for HIV/AIDS), Monjeza Maluza (Minister of Home 
Affairs), Phillip Bwanali (Minister of Sports, Youth, and 
Culture), Wallace Chiume (Minister of Tourism), Salim Bagus 
(Minister of State for Local Government), Heatherwick Ntaba 
(Minister of Mining and Energy), Chipimpha Mughogho (Minister 
without portfolio), James Chikwenga (Deputy Minister of 
Transport and Public Works), Sebastian Chikhadza (Deputy 
Minister of Health), and Khwauli Msiska (Deputy Minister of 
Finance).  Other notables who failed in their electoral bids 
were Enock Chihana (son of AFORD President Chihana and an 
official in Muluzi\'s Office of the President and Cabinet) and 
the UDF Secretary General Kennedy Makwangwala.  Friday Jumbe, 
who had been Minister of Finance but had not been a 
parliamentarian, won his constituency. 
 
10.  (U) Flamboyant former Minister of Water Dumbo Lemani, 
speaking in an impromptu press conference on May 23, called 
for all former UDF heavyweights who had lost their seats to 
resign from the party\'s National Executive Committee.  UDF 
spokesman Ken Lipenga later qualified Lemani\'s statements, 
however, saying they were not the views of the party. 
 
Comment 
------- 
11.  (SBU) Lemani, an inner-circle hack of former President 
Muluzi, was ingratiating himself to Mutharika with his call 
for UDF losers to resign, but his demand illuminates the 
difficulties the party faces.  The sharp drop in voter 
turnout, the splintering of Parliament, the unprecedented 
victories of closet UDF and other independent candidates, and 
the fall of many former cabinet members all point to a UDF 
leadership out of touch with the voters and an electorate 
deeply dissatisfied with the status quo.  Many voters feel 
that it is they who lost the elections.  Re-fashioning and 
re-orienting the UDF leadership to that reality will be a 
major challenge for Mutharika -- if the hand-picked successor 
to Muluzi is up to the challenge. 
 
12.  (SBU) Comment continued.  More immediately, the UDF is 
focused on trying to build a working majority in the National 
Assembly, and party operatives are already wooing independent 
parliamentarians.  Most of the independents will return to 
the UDF, but their renewed loyalty will be costly, as would 
an alliance of convenience with one of the opposition 
parties.  How the party\'s need to co-opt parliamentarians is 
balanced against Mutharika\'s stated goal of reducing the 
country\'s bloated cabinet will tell much about the future of 
the UDF, Mutharika\'s standing in the party, and the promise 
of the new government for the average voter.

1. (U) Summary: Bingu wa Mutharika was inaugurated as 
Malawi\'s third president on May 24 at a sparsely-attended 
ceremony in Blantyre.  Calling for reconciliation, reform, 
and peace in his inaugural address, he outlined a program to 
move Malawi \"from poverty to prosperity\"; announced his 
intentions to institute broad reforms; and indicated his 
willingness to work with the opposition.  His remarks were in 
stark contrast to those of outgoing president Bakili Muluzi 
who used the occasion to lambaste the opposition and the 
media, and to mischaracterize the assessment of the elections 
made by international observer groups.  Heads of state from 
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Rwanda were present, 
along with delegations from several other countries.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
A Political Rally in the Guise of an Inauguration 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
2. (U) Less than 24 hours after the announcement of results 
of May 20\'s presidential and parliamentary elections (reftel 
c), Bingu wa Mutharika was sworn in as Malawi\'s third 
president, and Cassim Chilumpha assumed the position of first 
vice-president.  The ceremony at Blantyre\'s Chichiri Stadium 
was poorly attended, and spectators had to be bused in at the 
last moment to avoid the embarrassment of empty grandstands. 
There were no representives from opposition parties present, 
nor were there more than a few individuals representing civil 
society.  The audience was comprised of government officials, 
foreign dignitaries, the diplomatic corps, civil servants, 
and a large number of supporters of the ruling United 
Democratic Front (UDF). 
 
3. (SBU) The presidents of South Africa, Zimbabwe, 
Mozambique, and Rwanda flew in for the day to attend the 
inauguration.  Delegations representing Taiwan, Libya, 
Lesotho, Swaziland, Zambia, Tanzania, Namibia, Kenya, SADC, 
and COMESA also attended.  The crowd roundly applauded 
President Mugabe on his arrival, but saved its loudest cheers 
for South African President Mbeki.  (Note: Mbeki was clearly 
the prize most coveted by the GOM to give legitimacy to the 
elections.  His participation was in question as late as the 
afternoon of May 23 when election results were finally 
announced amid protests by opposition parties.) 
 
4. (U) Attendance at the ceremony was affected by the 
bitterness of opposition supporters at the conduct of the 
elections, and by their disappointment with the results. 
When opposition candidate Gwanda Chakuamba preemptorily 
announced his \"victory\" on May 22, most of his supporters 
believed he had indeed won.  When it transpired that Muluzi\'s 
hand-picked successor had won the election with only 36% of 
the votes (with the remaining 64% split among four opposition 
candidates), protests became violent in the streets of 
Blantyre (reftel b) which also was a factor in the low 
turn-out at the inauguration. 
 
5. (U) Though Mutharika concluded with a gracious acceptance 
speech outlining an ambitious reform program, the bulk of the 
ceremony had the feel of a political rally.  Master of 
Ceremonies (and Muluzi\'s Minister of State for Presidential 
Affairs) Ken Lipenga politicized the invocation prayers.  To 
the roars of the partisan crowd, he took thinly-veiled 
pot-shots at religious groups (primarily the Catholics, 
Presbyterians, and Anglicans) who had opposed the UDF. 
Dripping sarcasm, Lipenga thanked clergy for their prayers 
for a new president and for fair elections, saying that \"the 
Almighty has answered that prayer.\"  Hand-picked pro-UDF 
clergy members then gave invocations. 
 
6. (SBU) Outgoing president Bakili Muluzi got the crowd to 
its feet in his trademark political rally style.  He thanked 
the people of Malawi for their support over the last ten 
years, and then lashed out at the opposition.  Muluzi noted 
that international observers from various organizations had 
come to Malawi, and that all had declared the elections free 
and fair.  (Note: In fact, not one group has done so, per 
reftel a, and the EU issued a press release within hours 
disputing Muluzi\'s statement.)  Muluzi also poured scorn on 
opposition candidates protesting the results and the 
administration of the elections, on international media (and 
specifically the BBC) for \"breeding unnecessary confusion,\" 
and emphasized repeatedly that Malawi was \"a sovereign state\" 
and will not take orders from anyone. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Mutharika: \"From Poverty to Prosperity\" 
--------------------------------------- 
7.  (U) Mutharika completely changed the tone in his 
thoughtful and muted address. He called for reconciliation, 
peace, and deep reforms, pledging to move Malawi from poverty 
to prosperity.  He outlined a four-pronged reform package in 
the public, private, agricultural, and civil service sectors. 
 He also acknowledged the need for the GOM to build and 
strengthen relations with the donor community -- a clear 
reference to problems Malawi recently faced with the IMF 
after GOM failure to keep its pledges led to the suspension 
of funding. 
 
8.  (U) The new president also called for a reduction in the 
size of Malawi\'s 46-member cabinet, better controls on 
parastatals, strict adherence to a national budget, and the 
move of the presidency and other executive branch offices 
from Blantyre to the capital city of Lilongwe.  Notably, he 
pledged to stamp out corruption with a \"zero tolerance\" 
policy.  He promised independent audits of government 
spending, the strengthening of anti-corruption institutions, 
and the swift prosecution of offenders \"at all levels.\"  To a 
suprising round of applause (considering the audience), he 
added:  \"And let me repeat -- at ALL levels!\" 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
9.  (SBU) Mutharika said all the right things and impressed 
many observers by deviating from the script adhered to by the 
rest of the UDF at the ceremony.  The fact that his comments 
were in such sharp contrast to those of Muluzi and other UDF 
heavyweights is a clear indication of the challenge ahead of 
him in the coming months.   As chairman of the UDF, Muluzi 
has made it known he has no intention of fading into the 
background.   In fact, he plans to continue taking the lead 
on \"political\" matters while Mutharika busies himself 
cleaning up the economic mess he inherited.  If Mutharika is 
able to assert independence from Muluzi, he may be able to 
follow through on some of his pledges to put Malawi\'s house 
in order.  With no power base of his own and without a 
working majority in parliament, however, Mutharika has his 
work cut out for him.   End Comment.

1. (U) Summary.  President Bingu wa Mutharika convened heads 
of mission from donor countries and agencies in Lilongwe for 
a two-hour meeting on May 27 during which he outlined his 
plans to move Malawi from \"poverty to prosperity.\"   While 
the bulk of the meeting was spent paraphrasing the 
inauguration speech he delivered three days earlier, he 
deviated from the script long enough to divulge plans to 
dramatically reduce the size of the cabinet; that he favors 
state subsidies in the agriculture sector; that he intends to 
establish a new university; that he will jail opposition 
leader Gwanda Chakuamba if he continues to cause problems; 
and that he wants the support of international donors to deal 
with Malawi\'s crushing domestic debt burden.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
\"From Poverty to Prosperity\"..... 
--------------------------------- 
2. (U) Mutharika provided chiefs of mission with copies of 
his inaugural speech outlining his plans to turn Malawi\'s 
economy around.  (A copy of the speech has been faxed to 
AF/S.)  As noted in reftel, Mutharika intends to move Malawi 
\"from poverty to prosperity\" (which has already become his 
administration\'s tag-line) by implementing a four-pronged 
reform package in the public, private, agricultural, and 
civil service sectors.  He reiterated his pledges to control 
corruption, make statutory corporations profitable (or close 
them down), and reduce expenditures and borrowing. 
 
3. (SBU) The president said he was still working on reducing 
the size of the cabinet from 46 (29 ministers and 17 deputy 
ministers).  Though he has yet to settle on an exact figure, 
he said its size should be \"no more than twenty\" -- including 
the president himself and the two vice presidents.  He made 
clear to donors that he is \"running a risk\" and that there 
will be many (presumably from the former government) who will 
soon be \"cursing me at their breakfast tables.\" 
 
4. (U) To further lower expenditures, Mutharika said he would 
reduce state residence and travel expenses, and would soon 
begin \"dismantling\" government offices in Blantyre.  He vowed 
to make Lilongwe a true capital and noted he had moved from 
Blantyre on the first day of his administration. 
 
----------------- 
,,, but at a Cost 
----------------- 
5. (SBU) While pressing for expenditure reductions, Mutharika 
also announced several big-ticket items that will be 
difficult for the government to fund.  He announced his plan 
to turn Malawi into a \"hunger-free\" nation in about two 
years.  To do so,he said the prices of fertilizer and maize 
must be reduced, and that farmers needed to be provided 
Starter Packs (seeds and fertilizer).  He stated that if the 
private sector fails to reduce prices of fertilizer and 
maize, he will \"close down their shops\" and have the state 
take over -- if only on a \"temporary\" basis.  He added that 
he would also promote irrigation projects to increase 
Malawi\'s agricultural output. 
 
6. (SBU) Another expensive proposal is Mutharika\'s plan to 
establish a third university in Malawi.   Pointing out that 
there is a university in the Southern Region and one in the 
Northern Region, he said it was only natural that there 
should be one in the capital city of Lilongwe in the Central 
Region. 
 
------------------------------ 
Chakuamba: \"I\'ll Lock Him Up!\" 
------------------------------ 
7. (SBU) In telling donors he intended to enhance security in 
the country by increasing the government\'s support to the 
police and the military, Mutharika went off-script to skewer 
opposition candidate Gwanda Chakuamba, who has filed a court 
petition to have the results of the election declared null 
and void.  Pointing out that Chakuamba also contested the 
national elections in 1994 and 1999 and incited his 
supporters to cause disturbances, Mutharika said: \"The man is 
a thug, pure and simple.\"  Mutharika added (three times) that 
if disturbances continued, he would lock Chakuamba up. 
Insisiting that Chakuamba\'s protests are not political (\"the 
man is greedy and crazy\"), he vowed he \"will not tolerate 
disturbance of the peace in this country.\" 
 
8. (SBU) Mutharika also told donors not to believe stories 
that the Catholics and Presbyterians had opposed his 
candidacy. Insisting that only a few individuals were the 
instigators of anti-UDF sentiment in the churches, he claimed 
that religious leaders were now making known their support of 
him. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Appeal to Donors: \"It\'s Not My Debt\" 
------------------------------------ 
9. (SBU) Mutharika appealed to donors for support in reducing 
domestic debt.  Saying he could not implement his reforms 
while simultaneously paying off Malawi\'s domestic debt (note: 
currently at about $600 million), he asked for donors\' help 
in \"eliminating\" domestic debt.  Claiming that \"it\'s not my 
debt,\" Mutharika said he should not be burdened with the 
situation created by the previous government.   (Note: 
Mutharika served as Minister of Economic Planning up until 
his election.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
10.  (SBU) While almost everything Mutharika said in two hours 
was measured, soothing, well-reasoned, and designed to enlist 
the good will of donors, his discourse was punctuated by some 
jarring comments.  Talking about reducing expenditures while 
at the same time announcing plans for a new university (in a 
country where primary and secondary education is 
disfunctional) represents a clear disconnect.   Likewise, 
extolling the virtues of the private sector while announcing 
that the GOM will subsidize agriculture (and close down 
private vendors if they fail to reduce prices sufficiently) 
is unsettling.  And while many would agree that Chakuamba is 
indeed stirring up trouble after his electoral loss, 
Mutharika\'s vitriol and threats of imprisonment (which would 
certainly provide Chakuamba the mantle of martyrdom) seem 
unwise for a new head of state who somehow has to find a way 
both to unify a badly divided country and to reassure donors. 
 End comment.

1. Summary: Presidential and parliamentary elections in 
Malawi left one radio station shut down and four of its 
staff members in police custody for airing an `inflammatory 
interview\' with an opposition leader who was disputing 
election results.  A journalist from another private radio 
station was arrested and charged for broadcasting a false 
elections-related story.  A third independent radio station 
was stopped from broadcasting public feedback of the 
elections as authorities calmed tempers and emotions in the 
aftermath of the May 20 elections. End Summary. 
 
2. The Malawi Institute of Journalism (MIJ) Radio was shut 
down on May 23, and four of its reporters were arrested for 
airing an \"inflammatory interview\" with opposition 
Mgwirizano Coalition spokesperson Dr. Kholiwe Mkandawire. It 
is alleged that Dr. Mkandawire suggested that Blanytre\'s 
airport could be closed which would have barred visiting 
dignitaries from attending President Bingu Wa Mutharika\'s 
inauguration.  Dr. Mkandawire is also reported to have said 
the Malawi Defense Force (MDF) would intervene if there was 
rigging by the ruling United Democratic Front.  The MDF 
immediately denied the claim and vowed to remain apolitical. 
Two of the arrested MIJ reporters were released the same day 
and the other two have since been released on bail.  The 
radio station is still closed and guarded by police. (Note: 
MIJ radio\'s clashes with authorities are not new. The Malawi 
Communications Regulatory Authority previously threatened to 
withdraw the radio station\'s broadcasting license because it 
was airing political news bulletins, which is, according to 
MACRA, not permitted under MIJ\'s community radio license. 
End note.) 
 
3.  On election day, a journalist from independent Capital 
Radio was arrested for broadcasting a \"false and malicious\" 
story that alleged a senior traditional authority had been 
caught with stuffed ballot boxes. A retraction of the story 
and an apology aired by the radio station did not stop the 
police from arresting the journalist and pressing charges of 
broadcasting material likely to cause a breach of peace. The 
journalist was released on bail the following day.  The 
Malawi Police Service was also reported to have stopped 
another independent radio station, Power 101 FM, from 
broadcasting the views on the elections on a call-in 
program. 
 
4.  Comment. Malawi\'s elections were marred from the start 
by the bias of the state-run radio and television.  The 
arrests of journalists from private media, while troubling, 
did not affect voting or election day turnout. End comment.

     B. LILONGWE 449 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) As Parliament prepares for the June 7 swearing-in of 
new members and selection of leadership, opposition political 
parties have pledged to work together to take control of the 
House.  Meanwhile, the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) 
is trying to gain the support of independents MPs, most of 
whom were once members of the UDF.  Establishing and 
maintaining a working majority will likely dominate 
parliamentary politics over the coming year.  END SUMMARY. 
 
COMPOSITION OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
------------------------------------ 
2. (U) Revised election tallies and wrangles over disputed 
results in some parliamentary districts leave the current 
breakdown of political parties in Parliament as follows: 
Malawi Congress Party (MCP) - 56; United Democratic Front 
(UDF) - 49; Republican Party - 15; National Democratic 
Alliance (NDA) - 8; Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) 6; 
People\'s Progressive Movement (PPM) - 6; Movement for Genuine 
Democratic Change (MGODE) - 3; Congress for National Unity 
(CONU) - 1; and People\'s Transformation Party (PETRA) - 1. 
39 independents also won seats.  For the 193 member house, 
the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) has not yet announced 
results for 3 constituencies and will hold by-elections in 6 
constituencies in which elections were not held. 
 
3. (U) By-elections will also be held in President Bingu wa 
Mutharika and Vice President Cassim Chilumpha\'s 
constituencies, as the Constitution bars the President and 
First and Second Vice Presidents from holding seats in the 
National Assembly.  (NOTE: Until by-elections are conducted, 
the UDF will only have 47 MPs, which reduces its ability to 
influence the initial selection of Parliament\'s leadership. 
It is expected that the UDF will win the by-elections in both 
the President and Vice President\'s constituencies.) 
 
ALLIANCE BUILDING 
----------------- 
4. (SBU) To bolster its numbers, the ruling UDF has actively 
been pursuing independents and opposition MPs to join its 
ranks, or to enter informal voting alliances.  UDF chairman 
Bakili Muluzi, who vowed that independents would not be 
welcomed back into the party, has reversed himself and called 
for independents to return to the UDF.  The UDF leadership 
claims to have support from several of them, many of whom 
originally wished to stand on the UDF ticket but were not 
supported by the UDF leadership.  CONU MP Richard Mwaila has 
also announced he will support the UDF. 
 
5. (SBU) A May 25 press release issued by the MCP, NDA, and 
Mgwirizano Coalition (comprising RP, PPM, MGODE, and PETRA) 
stated that the parties have agreed to work together \"to 
effectively provide a vibrant opposition in Parliament and 
ensure that there are checks and balances in all operations 
of government.\"  If successful in joining together, the 
opposition coalition would have support from 89 MPs, 8 shy of 
a simple majority in the House (before independents are 
counted).  MCP MP Louis Chimango has been tipped as Speaker 
of Parliament, with the First and Second Duty Speakerships 
going to the RP and NDA, respectively.  The statement, 
however, explicitly stated that \"each party will work 
independently outside Parliament\" and that the agreement to 
work together does not negate RP President Gwanda Chakuamba\'s 
legal challenge of the elections (reftel B).  (NOTE: An MCP 
spokesperson announced on May 20 that MCP will support 
Chakuamba\'s case by providing legal support and evidence. 
END NOTE.) 
 
PARLIAMENT TO CONVENE, SELECT LEADERS 
------------------------------------- 
6. (U) The Clerk of Parliament announced on May 31 that 
Parliament will hold a swearing-in of new members and 
selection of leadership on June 7.  Among the positions to be 
determined are Speaker, First and Second Deputy Speakers, and 
committee chairs.  The two-day session will also include a 
basic orientation to Parliament. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. (SBU) Independents will be the key players in Parliament, 
and they are currently being wooed by both sides.  At 
present, it is difficult to determine how many will support 
the ruling party and how many will join the opposition 
alliance.  The almost equal division between the two sides 
will also make the forthcoming by-elections very contentious 
competitions, which could ultimately determine who has 
control of Parliament.  In any case, maintenance of alliances 
will remain a constant challenge for leadership on both sides 
of the house. 
 
8. COMMENT CONTINUED.  In the past, opposition has seen its 
primary role as that of thwarting government initiatives 
rather than offering alternate programs and policies.  If the 
opposition does successfully take control of the House\'s 
leadership, it will have to break from this mind-set in order 
to work constructively.  END COMMENT.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) Ten days after the elections, President Bingu wa 
Mutharika has not yet appointed a cabinet.  With speculation 
and rumors abounding, it is clear that Mutharika is having a 
difficult time both in balancing internal UDF politics and in 
building a working majority in Parliament.  The cabinet\'s 
final size and composition will be a clear indicator of 
Mutharika\'s independence (or not) from former President and 
current UDF chairman Bakili Muluzi, who remains very engaged 
in party and government affairs.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BINGU: \"NO MORE THAN TWENTY,\" MULUZI: A LIST OF 32 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
2. (C) As reported reftel, President Bingu wa Mutharika told 
donor chiefs of mission on May 27 that his cabinet would be 
\"no more than twenty,\" including the President and two Vice 
Presidents.  Reduced from 46, a small cabinet was a central 
point in Mutharika\'s message to donors that the GOM was ready 
to get serious about stabilizing the economy, kickstarting 
growth, and reducing poverty. 
 
3. (C) However, UDF insiders say that Muluzi gave Mutharika a 
list of 32 people who should be in cabinet.  The list was 
reportedly handed to Mutharika at a party meeting in Blantyre 
on May 30 that Muluzi \"summoned\" the new President to. 
 
WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYONE 
--------------------------- 
4. (C) Faced with its dismal showing in parliamentary 
elections and looking to build a working majority in 
Parliament, the UDF has been courting independent MPs and 
opposition leaders.  It first was rebuffed by Malawi Congress 
Party (MCP) President John Tembo, who controls 59 seats in 
Parliament.  UDF insiders report that UDF chairman Muluzi, 
flanked by Mutharika, then offered Gwanda Chakuamba\'s 
seven-party Mgwirizano Coalition, which commands 25 seats in 
Parliament, several ministerial positions to form an alliance 
with the UDF.  Muluzi supposedly offered positions to 
Coalition President Chakuamba (to be Second Vice President), 
People\'s Transformation Party (PETRA) President Kamuzu 
Chibambo, People\'s Progressive Movement (PPM) President Aleke 
Banda, and Republican Party (RP) Vice President Bazuka 
Mhango.  (Chakuamba, apparently more interested than other 
members of the Coalition, reportedly was offered a large sum 
of money, a house in Lilongwe, and the Second Vice 
Presidency.) 
 
5. (SBU) After confirming that a meeting took place at 
Muluzi\'s Blantyre residence on June 1, Aleke Banda said on a 
news radio program that the Coalition met to discuss the 
offer and decided to reject it. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (C) That the UDF would consider entering into an alliance 
with its political arch-enemies (who incidentally have filed 
a petition in the courts to declare the presidential 
elections null and void) is a sign of the party\'s desperation 
and its cynicism.  Faced with the prospect of being in the 
minority in Parliament, the UDF will do whatever it takes to 
form a coalition to keep it in control. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  If the UDF is successful (which is 
by no means certain) in wooing the opposition and 
independents into an alliance, Mutharika will have a hard 
time keeping his pledge to slash the size of his cabinet 
since ministerial seats will surely be the reward for 
support.  Already under pressure from Muluzi loyalists in his 
own party, Mutharika also needs to keep the UDF faithful 
happy.  And the longer he waits to appoint a cabinet, the 
greater the erosion of confidence in him.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: MALAWI UPDATE ON AGOA III 
 
REF: STATE 120038 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econoff Marc Dillard for reasons 1.5 b/d. 
 
1. (C) Per reftel request, failure to extend the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act\'s (AGOA) third-country fabric 
provision, if permanent or even long-term, would likely have 
a significant impact on Malawi\'s garment exports to the 
United States.  Of the five companies currently exporting 
under AGOA, the two largest are both Taiwanese and import all 
of the fabric they use from Asia.  Managers at those 
companies have told Econoff that the end of the third-country 
fabric provision would force them to reorganize their 
production and to consider pulling out of Malawi.  Malawi\'s 
primary producer of textiles is currently restructuring as 
part of the country\'s privatization program, and has not 
produced fabric for about six months.  The lapse of the 
third-country provision would therefore immediately raise 
production costs, as no local alternatives are available, and 
regional alternatives would be logistically difficult to 
obtain.  (Comment: the Taiwanese authorities are keen to see 
the companies remain in Malawi because Malawi has diplomatic 
relations with Taiwan, and inducements from the authorities 
might keep the companies here.  Continued expansion of 
production and job growth, however, would be unlikely.) 
 
2.  (C)  Although there is significant U.S. investment in 
Malawi, it is not highly visible.  To the average Malawian, 
AGOA is Malawi\'s economic relationship with the United 
States, and therefore layoffs or company closures among AGOA 
exporters would be seen as a step backwards in bilateral 
relations.  Given that a lapse of the fabric provision could 
also make the current restructuring of Malawi\'s primary 
textile producer appear to be a failure, ending of the fabric 
provision could also undermine the country\'s privatization 
program and USG efforts to support private sector growth over 
state-run companies.

1. (SBU)  Summary:  In an act of breathtaking (though not 
surprising) opportunism, opposition leader Gwanda Chakuamba 
has allied himself with newly-elected president Bingu wa 
Mutharika and the United Democratic Front (UDF) party.   The 
UDF believes the addition of the 19 parliamentary seats 
Chakuamba brings with him will enable the party to forge a 
working majority in the National Assembly.  Chakuamba, a 
bitter loser in the May 20 presidential elections, has agreed 
to drop his legal petition to have the election results 
declared null and void.  President Mutharika, who just last 
week told donor chiefs of mission that Chakuamba was a \"thug 
and a liar\" will no doubt make room in his cabinet for his 
erstwhile opponent.  With a coalition now formed, Mutharika 
is expected to announce his cabinet imminently.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U) Opposition party leader and former presidential 
candidate Gwanda Chakuamba on June 3 quit the seven-party 
opposition coalition he headed to ally himself with the 
ruling UDF.  The move fractures the opposition, leaving 
Mgwirizano Coalition vice president (and former UDF 
heavyweight) Aleke Banda as the new leader of a significantly 
weakened five-party coalition. 
 
3. (SBU) After its dismal performance in parliamentary 
elections, the UDF began courting opposition party leaders in 
order to create a majority coalition in parliament (reftel 
A). Former president Bakili Muluzi, who is chairman of the 
UDF, hosted Chakuamba at his residence in Blantyre on May 31 
and made an offer Chakuamba eventually accepted.  Though 
details are not known, there is widespread speculation that 
Chakuamba was offered a cabinet position, a large sum of 
money, and perhaps a house in Lilongwe. There is also 
speculation that Chakuamba will soon retire from politics. 
 
4.  (SBU) Chakuamba\'s Republican Party controls 16 
parliamentary seats; the Movement for Genuine Democratic 
Change (MGODE), which is also breaking ranks with the 
coalition to join the UDF, has three seats; and the UDF 
currently has 49 seats, plus is in partnership with AFORD and 
the Congress for National Unity with a total of seven more 
seats.   This still leaves the UDF short of the 97 seats it 
needs to have a majority in the 193-seat assembly, but it 
believes it will easily be able to secure the support of most 
of the 38 newly-elected independents.  The new parliament is 
to convene June 7-8, and the exact size and composition of 
the UDF\'s coalition will be clear then. 
 
5. (SBU)  Before election results were announced on May 23, 
Chakuamba proclaimed himself the victor.  After results 
indicated he had actually placed third, Chakuamba with his 
Mgwirizano Coalition filed suit to declare the presidential 
election results null and void (reftel B).  As a condition of 
the alliance, Chakuamba has agreed to drop his legal 
challenge, though the case may proceed with Banda acting in 
Chakuamba\'s place. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU)  Chakuamba is already being heavily criticized by 
supporters for his \"betrayal.\"  He will no doubt try to 
convince them that he agreed to participate in a coalition 
with the UDF for their benefit.  The UDF\'s extension of a 
political olive branch to former arch-enemies is less a 
gesture of good will than an attempt to resume control, and 
the parliamentary implications are yet unclear.  What is 
clear is that Chakuamba, who seems genuinely to believe he 
was going to win the presidential elections, decided he would 
rather be on the inside looking out.  Mutharika, whose 
contempt for Chakuamba was visceral just last week when he 
told donor chiefs of mission that the opposition leader was 
\"greedy and crazy,\" (reftel C) is learning that politics 
(especially when orchestrated by former president Muluzi) 
makes strange bedfellows. 
 
6. (U) Comment continued: We expect an imminent announcement 
of Mutharika\'s cabinet -- if not today, then before 
parliament convenes on June 7.  End comment.

REF: LILONGWE 488 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
1. (SBU) Eighteen days after his controversial election, 
President Bingu wa Mutharika has still to appoint a cabinet. 
Meanwhile, the Office of the President and Cabinet has 
postponed the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speakers of 
Parliament (ostensibly over legal technicalities).  The 
delayed appointment of a cabinet and the postponed election 
of the Speaker indicate that the ruling United Democratic 
Front (UDF) is not yet confident in the viability of its 
\"government of reconciliation,\" which was designed to give it 
a working majority in Parliament.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SPEAKER\'S ELECTION POSTPONED 
---------------------------- 
2. (U) On the eve of the June 7 swearing-in and orientation 
of new parliamentarians, the Clerk of Parliament announced 
that pursuant to a letter from the Secretary of the Office of 
President and Cabinet (OPC), Parliament\'s leadership will not 
be elected until the President officially calls the first 
session of Parliament.  The OPC statement indicated that the 
Constitution requires the Speaker and Deputy Speakers to be 
elected at the first session of Parliament and not at an 
\"unofficial\" organizational meeting, as had been previously 
announced. 
 
STILL NO CABINET 
---------------- 
3. (SBU) Yet to announce his cabinet, President Bingu wa 
Mutharika, along with United Democratic Front (UDF) chairman 
Bakili Muluzi, continues to seek support from independents 
and opposition MPs to gain a working majority in Parliament. 
The UDF\'s June 3 signing of a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) with the Republican Party (RP) and the Movement for 
Genuine Democratic Change (MGODE) has garnered the UDF 
several seats in the House and has cost it at least five 
cabinet level-positions (reftel).  In addition, a Blantyre 
business contact told econoff that Muluzi has been soliciting 
funds from business leaders in the U.K. and South Africa in 
order to secure a majority in the House. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
4. (SBU) It is unclear which RP and MGODE officials will 
receive cabinet-level positions.  RP President Gwanda 
Chakuamba, who was thought to be interested in the Second 
Vice Presidency, maintains that he plans \"to retire from 
politics.\" 
 
5. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED: Bartering for parliamentarians\' 
support is ongoing, and it is clearly getting expensive.  The 
delay in announcing the cabinet and OPC\'s directive to 
postpone the election of Parliament\'s leadership (while 
technically a legal question) indicate that the UDF has not 
yet acquired the majority it seeks.  END COMMENT

SUBJECT: GLOBAL FUND\'S EFFECTIVENESS IN MALAWI STIFLED 
 
 
1. (SBU) The Global Fund\'s effectiveness in Malawi, the 
largest HIV/AIDS award recipient, has been stifled by 
operational and administrative problems.  The goal of 
\"limited oversight\" has become unstructured and unwritten 
operational guidelines that are often confusing rather than 
liberating.  The \"new way of doing business\" has created ever 
changing methods of operation that do not always consider 
constraints on the ground.  The \"rapid roll-out\" of ARVs has 
caused funding announcements to get ahead of administrative 
support systems, resulting in the impeded movement of funds. 
Clear guidelines and increased communication with the Global 
Fund Secretariat would likely give Malawi\'s principal 
recipient, the National AIDS Commission (NAC), the confidence 
needed to implement programs quickly and effectively. 
 
2. (SBU) Currently, Malawi has three primary obstacles to 
effectively using Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria 
(GFATM) money: 
 
-- Changed guidelines have led to NAC\'s submission of several 
human capacity development and salary supplement components 
in its revised work plan  This new policy may result in 
\"top-ups\" on some government employees\' salaries and a 
scramble by health care professionals to NAC-funded 
institutions, creating even larger staffing gaps in regular 
health care facilities. 
 
-- UNICEF, charged with procurement and distribution of ARV 
drugs, has had serious administrative problems with 
delivering drugs.  From the release of funding for ARVs in 
January 2004, it took five months to procure the first 
shipment of drugs.  Similar delays in the future could 
interrupt patients\' treatment regimes. 
 
-- The GFATM has recently called into question the 
sufficiency of NAC and its sub-grantees\' financial management 
systems.  According to the GFATM\'s Local Fund Agent (LFA), 
all grantees, whether receiving funding directly or 
indirectly, must undergo initial and annual audits.  This 
seemingly new requirement makes problematic NAC\'s original 
plan to funnel funding through community-based and 
faith-based organizations. NAC fears many local organizations 
will legitimately not be able to fulfill audit requirements. 
NAC has thus put all sub-grant funding on hold until the 
issue is resolved. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
3. (SBU) When Malawi submitted its initial proposal to the 
Global Fund in 2002, the GFATM noted that \"absorptive 
capacity\" of funds, human resources constraints, and health 
system overload would be serious challenges for Malawi to 
overcome.  In mid-2002, the GFATM approved a revised version 
of Malawi\'s proposal, which reduced funding for technical 
assistance, monitoring, and evaluation, and awarded the 
National AIDS Commission (NAC) USD 196 million over the 
following five years.  A series of miscommunications and 
inadequate work plans, owing to changing information from the 
GFATM and misunderstandings by NAC, delayed the first tranche 
of real money (USD 9.5 million) until early 2004. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
4. (SBU) While many of these problems will have to be 
resolved by NAC and its local partners, increased 
communication with the Global Fund Secretariat would likely 
lead to smoother operations.  Specific written guidelines 
(yet not concrete policies) and direct communication with 
administrative and technical staff (not filtered through 
portfolio managers) would help NAC understand more clearly 
how it can and cannot implement programs, giving it the 
confidence necessary to lead the Global Fund initiative in 
Malawi.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT - MALAWI 
 
REF: 03 STATE 128494 
 
1.  The following is the June 2004 update of Malawi\'s 
Investment Climate Statement. 
 
Openness to Foreign Investment 
------------------------------ 
2.   The Government encourages both domestic and foreign 
investment in most sectors of the economy, without 
restrictions on ownership, size of investment, source of 
funds, and destination of final product.  The 
Competition And Fair Trading Act -- passed by Parliament 
in November 1998 but made operational in April 2000 -- 
aims to regulate and monitor monopolies and the 
concentration of economic power, protect consumer 
welfare, and strengthen the efficient production and 
distribution of goods and services.  The Act calls for 
the formation of a commission that will approve only 
those acquisitions, mergers or takeovers that increase 
employment and net exports, and lower prices for 
consumers.  During the first half of 2000 the U.S.-based 
FCA Investment Company, together with the two local 
companies, acquired about 63% shares in the National 
Insurance Company of Malawi (NICO) through a cash 
takeover.  As of June 2004, however, the Ministry of 
Commerce had reported no progress in institutionalizing 
a secretariat to oversee implementation of the 
Competition and Fair Trading Act. 
 
3.  There is no government screening of foreign 
investment in Malawi.  Apart from the privatization 
program, the Government\'s overall economic and 
industrial policy does not have discriminatory effects 
on foreign investors.  Since industrial licensing in 
Malawi applies to both domestic and foreign investment, 
and is only restricted to a short list of products, it 
does not impede investment, limit competition, protect 
domestic interests, or discriminate against foreign 
investors at any stage of investment.  Restrictions are 
based on environmental, health, and national security 
concerns.  Affected items are firearms; ammunition, 
chemical and biological weapons; explosives; and 
manufacturing involving hazardous waste 
treatment/disposal or radioactive material.  All 
regulations affecting trade (foreign exchange, taxes, 
etc.) apply equally to domestic and foreign investors. 
 
4.  As of June 2004, Malawi had privatized 61 units  of 
approximately 110 state-owned enterprises targeted for 
privatization, generating about MK 1.0 billion (about 
USD 9.2 million).  All investors, irrespective of ethnic 
group or source of capital (foreign or local) may 
participate in the privatization program.  However, the 
Malawi Stock Exchange regulations limit participation of 
an individual foreign portfolio investor to a maximum of 
10% of any class or category of security under the 
program; and limit maximum total foreign investment in 
any portfolio to 49%.  The Privatization Act also 
prohibits members of the Cabinet, or employees of the 
Privatization Commission or its consultants, to 
participate in any divestiture except where an offer is 
made to the general public.  Malawian nationals are 
offered preferential treatment, including discounted 
share prices and subsidized credit.  Since July 2000, 
the maximum subsidized credit amount has been increased 
from 20,000 Malawi Kwacha (MK) (about 184 USD) to MK 
50,000 (about 459 USD) and the minimum income threshold 
of MK 10,000 per month (about 92 USD) was removed. 
Subsidized credit carries a precondition that the shares 
or assets be retained for at least two years. 
 
Conversion and Transfer Policies 
-------------------------------- 
5.  There are no restrictions on remittance of foreign 
investment funds (including capital, profits, loan 
repayments and lease repayments) as long as the capital 
and loans were obtained from foreign sources and 
registered with the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM).  The 
terms and conditions of international loans, management 
contracts, licensing and royalty arrangements, and 
similar transfers require initial RBM approval.  The RBM 
grants approval according to prevailing international 
standards; subsequent remittances do not require further 
approval.  All commercial banks are authorized by the 
RBM to approve remittances, and approvals are fairly 
automatic as long as the applicant\'s accounts have been 
audited and sufficient foreign exchange is available. 
Businesspeople report no major problems with foreign 
currency remittances.  Traditionally, foreign exchange 
availability follows the agricultural cycle in Malawi. 
It is plentiful from April through September (when 
tobacco sales generate foreign exchange inflows), and 
scarce from October through March.  During periods of 
scarcity, investors may not have immediate access to 
foreign exchange.  As of January 2004, official foreign 
reserves equaled approximately 1.6  months of import 
cover. 
 
Expropriation and Compensation 
------------------------------ 
6.  Malawi\'s constitution prohibits deprivation of an 
individual\'s property without due compensation.  There 
are effective laws that protect both local and foreign 
investment.  The likelihood of expropriatory actions has 
been extremely remote since the repeal of the forfeiture 
act in 1992.  Although public tenders for the sale of 
shares of state-owned enterprises often encourage local 
participation, foreign investors tend to dominate the 
share-holding of large MSE-listed companies requiring 
significant technical and financial resources. 
 
7.  The Land Reform Commission -- which the Government 
established in 1996 to review land tenure and establish 
a new land reform program -- presented its final report 
to the President in November 1999.  In January 2002, the 
Ministry of Lands published a new land policy.  Draft 
legislation is being prepared, possibly for 
consideration by Parliament in 2004.  The draft law will 
likely incorporate many recommendations of the 
Commission\'s report, including the abolition of freehold 
tenure (owners holding permanent title) and the 
conversion of all freehold titles to leasehold (owners 
holding land on lease for a maximum period of 99 years.) 
As of July 2000, the Malawi Government stopped issuing 
freehold land. 
 
8.  At present, the Government may employ land 
acquisition procedures set forth in the Land Acquisition 
Act of 1971.  According to this Act, the government must 
justify its acquisition as being in the public interest 
and must pay fair market value for the land.  Fair 
market value is assessed by summing the amount the owner 
originally paid for the land, the value of any permanent 
improvements that increase the productive capacity, 
utility or amenity of the land, and any appreciation of 
the land value.  If the private landowner objects to the 
level of compensation, he may obtain an independent 
assessment of the land value.  According to the Act, 
however, such cases may not be challenged in court; the 
Ministry of Lands, Housing, Physical Planning, and 
Surveys remains the final judge.  Most land in Malawi is 
leasehold. 
 
Dispute Settlement 
------------------ 
9.  Malawi has an independent but overburdened 
judiciary, which derives its procedures from English 
Common Law.  There has been little government 
interference in the court system, although there have on 
occasion been allegations of government involvement -- 
largely through public comments made by politicians on 
certain cases.  There are also frequent allegations of 
bribery in civil and criminal cases.  Administration of 
the courts is weak, and due process can be very slow. 
Serious shortcomings in the judicial system include poor 
record keeping, a lack of attorneys and trained 
personnel, heavy caseloads, and insufficient financial 
resources. 
 
10.  The court system in Malawi accepts and enforces 
foreign court judgments that are registered in 
accordance with established legal procedure.  There are, 
however, reciprocal agreements among Commonwealth 
countries to enforce judgments without this registration 
obligation.  There is no such agreement between Malawi 
and the United States. 
 
11.  Malawi has legislation that offers adequate 
protection for property and contractual rights.  Malawi 
has written commercial laws, which codify Common Law. 
The Sale-Of-Goods Act, the Hire-Purchase Act, and the 
Competition and Fair Trading Act cover commercial 
practices.  The first two Acts have been consistently 
applied, and there is a track record of cases involving 
commercial law.  There is also a written and 
consistently applied Bankruptcy Law based on Common Law. 
Under Bankruptcy Law, secured creditors -- rank-ordered 
based upon investment registration dates -- have first 
priority in recovering money.  Monetary judgments are 
usually made in the investor\'s currency.  However, the 
immediate availability of foreign exchange is dependent 
upon supply, which varies on a seasonal basis. 
 
12.  Malawi is a member of the International Center for 
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and accepts 
binding international arbitration of investment disputes 
between foreign investors and the state if specified in 
a written contract.  There have been no investment 
disputes involving U.S. Companies since 1996. 
 
Performance Requirements/Incentives 
----------------------------------- 
13.  Malawi is not in compliance with WTO Trade Related 
Investment Measures (TRIM) notification requirements. 
However, Malawi does not set performance requirements 
for establishing, maintaining or expanding an 
investment.  Nor does it place requirements on 
ownership, source of financing, or geographic location. 
The Government accords EPZ status only to firms (foreign 
or domestic) that produce exclusively for export. 
 
14.  Malawi offers the following incentives, which apply 
equally to domestic and foreign investors: 
 
-- a corporate tax rate of 35%; 
 
-- the following tax allowances: 40% for new buildings 
and machinery; up to 20% for used buildings and 
machinery; 100% deduction for manufacturing company 
operating expenses in 2 years prior to start of 
business; and no withholding tax on dividends; 
 
-- no import duty on raw materials for manufacturing 
industry (N.B.  This policy is being implemented at the 
discretion of the Customs and Excise Department. 
Several manufacturers have recently complained of delays 
and denial of this incentive.); 
 
-- no import duty on computer equipment and accessories; 
 
-- tax holidays or reduced corporate tax for some new 
investments; and; 
 
-- a maximum import tariff rate of 25%. 
 
15.  Malawi offers the following special incentives for 
exporters: 
 
-- for exporters in EPZs: no corporate tax, value added 
tax, or withholding tax on dividends; no import duty on 
capital equipment and raw materials; and; no excise 
taxes on local purchases of raw materials and packaging. 
 
-- for industries manufacturing in bond: an 
allowance of 12% of export revenues for products other 
than Tobacco, tea, sugar and coffee; transport allowance 
of 25% of all international transport costs; no import 
duties on capital equipment; no import duties or 
surtaxes on raw materials; and no excise tax on local 
purchases of raw materials and packaging material. 
 
16.  The incentives in paragraphs 68 and 69 are applied 
consistently.  Foreign investors are generally accorded 
national treatment.  U.S. and other foreign firms are 
able to participate in government/donor-financed and/or 
subsidized-research and development programs.  The 
following information is required to register and 
incorporate a company: name of the company, authorized 
share capital, registered office, location of books of 
accounts, address of the company secretary, and names of 
directors and shareholders. 
 
17.  Visas do not inhibit investors, but the need for 
employment permits sometimes can.  Expatriate employees 
(of both domestic and foreign businesses) who reside and 
work in Malawi must obtain temporary employment permits 
(TEPs). 
 
18.  The government issued a revised \"Policy Statement 
and New Guidelines for The Issuance and Renewal of 
[Expatriate] Employment Permits\" (one document) in 
November 1998.  The new guidelines state that investors 
may employ expatriate personnel in areas where there is 
a shortage of \"suitable and qualified\" Malawians.  They 
underscored the government\'s desire to make TEPs readily 
available to expatriates, and mandated that processing 
times for TEP applications shall not exceed 40 working 
days.  The 1998 policy provides for two types of TEPs: 
 
-- those for \"key posts\" (defined as positions of 
\"strategic importance\" in business operations) which are 
granted for the life-span of the organization; and; 
 
-- those for \"time posts\" (defined as positions with 
contracts of three-year duration or less) which are 
granted for three-year periods and renewable once. 
 
19.  The government issues Business Residence Permits 
(BRPs) to foreign nationals who own/operate businesses 
in Malawi.  BRPs are issued for five-year periods and 
are renewable.  Permanent Residence Permits (PRPs) are 
issued to foreign spouses who reside permanently in 
Malawi, and to owners/operators of businesses who reside 
in Malawi for periods in excess of ten years.  PRP 
holders cannot work as employees.  Malawi\'s immigration 
laws governing BRPs and PRPs have been revised.  There 
are three categories of residence permits based on 
amount of investment, status of applicant (investor, 
retiree, student, spouse of a Malawi citizen) and period 
of business assignment.  The maximum number of resident 
permits per organization is five, with the actual number 
allowed dependent on the amount of investment. 
 
Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
-------------------------------------------- 
20.  The government encourages both domestic and foreign 
investors to establish and own business enterprises in 
most sectors of the economy.  All investors have the 
right to establish, acquire, and dispose of interests in 
business enterprises.  Public enterprises compete 
equally with private entities with respect to access to 
markets, credit and other business operations. 
 
Protection of Property Rights 
----------------------------- 
21.  Both foreign and domestic investors have access to 
Malawi\'s legal system, which functions fairly well, 
albeit slowly.  Malawi has laws that govern the 
acquisition, disposition, recording and protection of 
all property rights (land, buildings, etc.) as well as 
intellectual property rights (copyrights, patents and 
trademarks, etc.).  The government has signed and 
adheres to bilateral and multilateral investment 
guarantee treaties and key agreements on intellectual 
property rights.  Malawi is a member of the convention 
establishing the multilateral investment guarantee 
agency, the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO), the Berne Convention, and the Universal 
Copyright Convention. 
 
22.  The Copyright Society of Malawi (COSOMA), 
established in 1992, administers the 1989 Copyright Act 
which protects copyrights and \"neighboring\" rights in 
Malawi.  The Registrar General administers the Patent 
and Trademarks Act which protects industrial 
intellectual property rights in Malawi.  A public 
registry of patents and patent licenses is kept. 
Patents must be registered through an agent.  Trademarks 
are registered publicly following advertisement and a 
period of no objection.  WTO rules allow Malawi (as a 
less developed country) to delay full implementation of 
the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights (TRIPs) agreement until 2016.  The Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry (MCI) -- coordinator of WTO issues 
in Malawi -- has limited capacity to effectively track 
WTO developments. The MCI is working with COSOMA and the 
Registrar General to align relevant domestic legislation 
with the WTO TRIPs agreement with technical assistance 
from the Africa Regional Intellectual Property 
Organization (ARIPO). 
 
Transparency of the Regulatory System 
------------------------------------- 
23.  Malawi\'s industrial and trade reform program -- 
including rationalization of the tax system, 
liberalization of the foreign exchange regime, and 
elimination of trade and industrial licenses on several 
items and businesses -- has produced written guidelines 
intended to increase government use of transparent and 
effective policies to foster competition.  No tax, 
labor, environment, health and safety or other laws 
distort or impede investment.  However, procedural 
delays, red tape, and corrupt practices continue to 
impede the business and investment approval process. 
These include decision making, which is often neither 
transparent nor based purely on merit, and required 
land-access approvals.  While market prices for goods 
are generally not controlled, prices of certain other 
goods -- sugar (not well enforced), maize, petroleum 
products, and state-provided utilities -- are regulated. 
 
24. There have been positive steps towards increasing 
regulatory transparency and improving the foreign 
investment environment. These developments include: 
establishment of the National Electricity Council in 
October 1998; the establishment of the Malawi 
Communication Regulatory Authority (MACRA) in May 1999; 
the licensing and operation of a second cellular phone 
service provider in 1999; and the splitting of the 
former Malawi Posts and Telecommunication Corporation 
(MPTC) into the Malawi Posts Corporation (MPC) and 
Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL) as separate 
entities in May 2000.  The state-owned Petroleum Control 
Commission (PCC) relinquished its monopoly on petroleum 
imports in May 2000, allowing the private sector to 
import 80% of Malawi\'s fuel.  PCC now has a largely 
regulatory function within the petroleum sector. 
 
Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
25.  The Reserve Bank of Malawi has pursued a tight 
monetary policy since 2001.  In December 2000, growth in 
money supply (m2) was 42.4%.  In contrast, m2 growth was 
21.2% in 2001, 25.2% 2002, and 29.3% in 2003. 
 
26.  With the tighter monetary policy, headline 
inflation has dropped from 33.7% in January 2001 to 9% 
in May 2003.  It has since crept up again, and is now 
slightly above 10%.  Reserve Bank discount rates remain 
high at 35.0%, however, as excessive government spending 
has continued to put inflationary pressure on the 
economy.  As of May 2004, the kwacha was  trading at 
approximately 109 to the dollar. 
 
27.  The private sector in Malawi has a variety of 
credit instruments.  Credit is generally allocated on 
market terms.  Foreign investors may utilize domestic 
credit, but proceeds from investments made using local 
resources are not remittable. 
 
28.  Malawi has a sound banking sector, overseen and 
well regulated by the Reserve Bank of Malawi -- its 
central bank.  There are six full-service commercial 
banks:  First Merchant Bank Limited; Finance Bank of 
Malawi; Indefinance; National Bank of Malawi (NBM); 
Stanbic Bank (SB) and Loita Investment Bank.  Other 
financial institutions are: Investment and Development 
Bank of Malawi (INDEBANK); Investment and Development 
Fund of Malawi (INDEFUND); the Malawi Development 
Corporation (MDC); Finance Corporation of Malawi 
(Fincom); Leasing and Finance Company of Malawi (LFC); 
Malawi Savings Bank (MSB); the New Building Society 
(NBS); the Malawi Rural Finance Company (MRFC), 
Continental Discount House, and First Discount House. 
 
29.  NBM and SB, which operate on a commercial, for- 
profit basis, have dominated Malawi\'s commercial banking 
sector for the past 30 years.  As of December 2003, 
these banks controlled over 80% of the market.  Market 
shares for the remaining banks were as follows: FMB, 
6.4%; FBM, 3.8%; and Indefinance, 2.2%. 
 
30.  The structure of the Malawi banking sector changed 
significantly in 2001 with the privatization of the 
Stanbic Bank (SB).  Standard Bank of South Africa 
completed its purchase of 60% of SB in December 2001 as 
part of the privatization program. The conglomerate 
Press Corporation Limited (PCL), in which the government 
holds a 49% stake, sold out of SB but increased its 
holdings in rival National Bank of Malawi (NBM).  PCL 
now owns 50.1% of NBM. 
 
31.  The Companies Act, the Capital Market Development 
Act (1990), and the Capital Market Development 
Regulations (1992) provide the legislative and 
regulatory framework for the encouragement and 
facilitation of portfolio investment in Malawi.  The 
attendant legal, regulatory and accounting systems are 
transparent and consistent with international norms. 
These acts govern the Malawi Stock Exchange (MSE). 
 
32.  Stockbrokers Malawi Limited (SML) is the major 
registered stockbroker in Malawi.  SML ran the MSE under 
a three-year contract with the RBM until April 1, 2000 
when the two split to assume separate roles of a broker 
and regulator, respectively.  Two new brokerage firms, 
Continental Discount House and First Discount House, 
began operations in 2001 and 2002, respectively.  The 
MSE remains regulated by the Stock Exchange Commission. 
 
33.  SML runs a secondary market in government 
securities, and both local and foreign investors have 
equal access to the purchase of these securities.  The 
following eight companies are listed on the MSE: NICO, 
Blantyre Hotels Limited (BHL), Sugar Corporation of 
Malawi (SUCOMA), Commercial Bank of Malawi (CBM), 
Packaging Industries of Malawi (PIM), Press Corporation 
Limited (PCL), Old Mutual and National Bank of Malawi 
(NBM).  As of October 2003, 5.771 billion shares were in 
issue on the MSE, and the market capitalization was MK 
418.352  billion (USD 3.8 billion).  Other potential 
companies for listing on the SME include Bata Shoe 
Company, Leopard Match Company Limited, Malawi Insurance 
Brokers Limited, Manica Freight Services Limited and 
Bain Hogg Insurance Limited.  Malawi and other SADC 
markets are taking steps to harmonize listing 
requirements through the SADC stock exchange co- 
operation initiative. 
 
34.  The MSE\'s development is still in its nascent 
stage, and hostile takeovers have not yet occurred. 
Apart from the restrictions under the privatization 
program, the U.S. Embassy in Malawi is not aware of any 
specific measures taken by private firms to restrict 
foreign investment or participation.  Foreign investors 
tend to be the dominant shareholders in large MSE-listed 
companies requiring significant technical and financial 
resources.  The Competition and Fair Trading Act will 
not cover the day-to-day trading on the MSE, but will 
regulate mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers that are 
of national interest. 
 
Political Violence 
------------------ 
35.  Malawi has been largely free of political violence 
since gaining independence in 1964.  Apart from the 
disarming of the paramilitary group, the Malawi Young 
Pioneers, incidents of violence associated with Malawi\'s 
1994 transition to democracy were few.  Sporadic 
incidents of violence occurred at political rallies in 
late 1998.  The 1999 presidential and parliamentary 
election campaigns were largely free of political 
violence, but there were limited incidents of post- 
election violence (primarily small-scale property 
damage) in June 1999 and in by-elections in Blantyre in 
June 2001.  Sporadic violence in the run-up to the 2004 
elections, and in the days immediately following the 
elections, also occurred. 
 
36.  Incidents of labor unrest occasionally occur, but 
these are usually tame affairs.  Armed robberies 
(including carjackings) have increased in recent years. 
There are, however, no nascent insurrections, 
belligerent neighbors, or other politically motivated 
activities of major concern to investors. 
 
Corruption 
---------- 
37.  There are serious incidences/allegations of 
corruption, particularly in the area of customs and 
excise tax and government procurement.  The Corrupt 
Practices Act provides the legal framework for combating 
corruption in Malawi. 
 
38.  The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) is legally 
mandated to investigate corruption in Malawi.  Opened in 
1997 and fully staffed in 1998, the ACB has thus far 
brought forward one high-level case involving a former 
Minister of Transport and Public Works (acquitted). 
Three other former cabinet ministers were acquitted on 
corruption charges which seem to have been politically 
motivated.  High-profile investigations led to the 
arrest of nine customs officials -- including the vice 
president of the Malawi Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU) 
-- in December 1999, and prompted the President to 
rescind a pre-shipment inspection contract in February 
2000.  Given the difficulty the ACB has had in getting 
high-level cases prosecuted, Malawi\'s Law Commission 
recommended in 2002 that the ACB be authorized to 
prosecute cases directly, rather than through the 
politically appointed Director of Public Prosecutions 
(DPP).  Legislation to that effect was drafted in 2003, 
but was not passed due to opposition among cabinet 
members.   A revision to the Corrupt Practices Act, 
which mandated the DPP to report to Parliament on any 
cases it does not prosecute, was passed in 2004 instead. 
 
39.  Malawi subscribes to the provisions of the OECD 
Convention on Combating Bribery, but is not a signatory 
of the Convention.  Malawi\'s Penal Code prohibits 
bribery.  Giving or receiving a bribe -- whether to or 
from a Malawian or foreign official -- is a crime under 
section 90 of Malawi\'s penal code.  Accordingly, bribes 
are not tax deductible. 
Bilateral Investment Agreements 
------------------------------- 
40.  Malawi\'s policy is to negotiate bilateral 
investment treaties with countries whose nationals opt 
to invest in Malawi.  The United States-Malawi Double 
Taxation Agreement from the colonial period was canceled 
by the United States in 1983.  To date, there is neither 
a bilateral investment nor a taxation treaty.  There 
have been no taxation issues of concern to U.S. 
investors since 1996. 
 
41.  Malawi acceded to the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1985/86.  Since MIGA provides 
mechanisms for the settlement of investment disputes, 
Malawi has not renewed several investment treaties that 
lapsed after 1986.  However, the United Kingdom, the 
Netherlands, Denmark, South Africa, Norway, Sweden and 
Switzerland still maintain Double Taxation Treaties with 
Malawi. 
 
OPIC and Other Insurance Programs 
--------------------------------- 
42.  Malawi has had an OPIC investment guarantee 
agreement since 1967.  In August 1999 the U.S. Export- 
Import Bank included Malawi under its new Africa Short- 
term Export Credit Insurance Program.  The estimated 
annual U.S. Dollar value of local currency likely to be 
used by the U.S. Mission is about USD 3.0 million. 
Malawi operates a managed-float exchange rate system in 
which the RBM buys or sells foreign exchange whenever 
foreign exchange reserves deviate significantly from 
targets jointly agreed upon with the IMF. 
 
43.  Foreign exchange availability in Malawi follows the 
agricultural cycle and tends to be plentiful from April 
through September when tobacco sales generate foreign 
exchange inflows.  The agricultural cycle, regional 
political and economic troubles (in, for example, 
Zimbabwe), and large influxes of foreign exchange from 
donor countries can all influence the Dollar/Kwacha 
exchange rate, which has been somewhat volatile over the 
past two years.  As of May 2004, the Kwacha was trading 
at around 109 to the dollar. 
 
Labor 
----- 
44.  The Government of Malawi estimates that more than 
half of the population is of working age. Unskilled 
labor is plentiful.  Skilled labor is scarce. 
Occupational categories with skills shortages include 
accountants and related personnel; economists; 
engineers; primary and secondary school teachers; 
lawyers; and medical and health personnel.  The 
University of Malawi provides bachelors and masters 
degrees in economics, engineering, medicine, education, 
agriculture and administration.  The Malawi College of 
Accountancy teaches accounting.  Chancellor College 
operates the country\'s law school.  In early 1999, the 
government established the Technical, Entrepreneurial 
and Vocational Education and Training (TEVET) program to 
address technical skills shortages in industry. 
 
45.  The Labor Relations Act (LRA) governs labor- 
relations management in Malawi.  It was signed into law 
in June 1996, and entered into force on December 1, 
1997.  The Act allows strikes and lockouts for 
registered workers and employers after dispute 
settlement procedures in collective agreements and 
conciliation have failed.  As democracy and trade union 
rights have existed only since 1994, industrial 
relations are still evolving.  Employers, labor unions, 
and government lack sufficient knowledge of their 
legitimate roles in labor relations/disputes. 
 
46.  Workers have the legal right to form and join trade 
unions.  As of December 2003, 26 unions were registered. 
Union membership is low, however, given the small 
percentage of the work force in the formal sector (about 
12%), the lack of awareness of worker rights and 
benefits, and a resistance on the part of many employees 
to join unions.  Only 13% of people employed in the 
formal sector belong to unions.  Unions may form or join 
federations, and have the right to affiliate with and 
participate in the affairs of international workers\' 
organizations.  While the government is a signatory to 
the ILO Convention protecting worker rights, mechanisms 
for enforcing the provisions of the convention are weak. 
There are serious manpower shortages at the Ministry of 
Labor, resulting in almost no labor-standards 
inspections. 
 
Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
------------------------------ 
47.  Legislation for the establishment of export 
processing zones (EPZs) came into force in December 
1995.  All companies engaged exclusively in manufacture 
for export may apply for EPZ status.  As of June 2004, 
Malawi had approved 21 firms for EPZ status, of which 17 
were operational and four had closed operations.  A 
manufacturing under bond (MUB) scheme offers slightly 
less attractive incentives to companies that export 
some, but not all, of their manufactures.  (See 
paragraph 69.) 
 
Foreign Direct Investment Statistics 
------------------------------------ 
48.  The RBM maintains records on the value and 
composition of foreign direct investment in Malawi.  The 
U.S. Dollar value (in current dollars) of total annual 
FDI for the 1994 to 2002 time period follows:

Summary 
------- 
1.  (SBU) Visiting IMF officials told donors that poor 
fiscal and monetary performance had caused the Fund\'s 
Executive Board not to consider Malawi\'s case in April. 
Given the country\'s poor performance, the current facility 
(which was to have run through December) has been abandoned. 
Having lost confidence in the GOM\'s ability to perform, IMF 
officials returned to Malawi not to negotiate but to explore 
alternative ways forward with the new government.  One 
possibility would be a fast-tracked informal program 
designed to give Malawi the chance to rapidly demonstrate 
commitment to targets and to create a positive track record 
of performance.  We support giving the new government the 
opportunity to prove itself, because Malawi ultimately 
requires both fiscal discipline and external aid to address 
its poverty.  End summary. 
 
IMF Team Back in Lilongwe 
------------------------- 
2. (U) IMF Mission Chief for Malawi John Green and Africa 
Department Senior Advisor Michael Nowak visited Malawi (on 
slightly different schedules) between June 1 and June 5. 
Green met with the Charge, AID Director, and Econoff on June 
1, and Nowak and Green briefed donors on their visit on June 
3.  Nowak and Green met President Mutharika on June 4. 
 
3.  (SBU) In line with what the IMF has been saying in 
Washington, Nowak and Green described the Fund\'s experience 
with Malawi as \"uneven,\" with a poor track record by 
international standards.  They stated that the Fund\'s 
reputation and credibility had been undermined by events in 
Malawi and that Fund management\'s \"time and patience were 
running out.\"  The goal of their visit, said Nowak, was not 
to negotiate on the current program, but to \"explore ways 
forward.\" 
 
4.  (SBU) Nowak suggested that a short-duration informal 
program (staff-monitored from Washington) to establish a 
track record would be one possible option.  Such a program 
would be built around two pillars: 1) a set of required 
fiscal policy actions; and 2) quantitative targets on key 
macroeconomic indicators.  Noting that a \"lack of commitment 
and intent at the highest levels,\" as well as some capacity 
restraints, had characterized Malawi\'s program under former 
President Muluzi, Nowak offered that a new program could 
come with some technical assistance, but he kept the need 
for Malawi to demonstrate performance as a key theme. 
 
5.  (SBU) In response to questions from some skeptical 
donors, Green elaborated on the reasons the IMF did not go 
forward with an Executive Board meeting about Malawi in 
April.  Green stated that the GOM overspent significantly in 
March and April, and that it had engaged in some dodgy 
financing as well. Nowak said he was confident the Fund had 
made the right decision by not going forward.  An IMF 
staffer added that the overspending had been significant 
enough that GOM domestic debt has increased by approximately 
5.7 billion kwacha (c. 52 million USD) since March. 
 
6.  (SBU) The election of President Mutharika on May 20 
created the opportunity for a new beginning, stated Nowak, 
but Malawi needs to convince the Board and the Fund staff 
that it can meet realistic and agreed-upon targets. If 
Malawi can do so, Nowak outlined a best-case scenario in 
which the Fund could perhaps begin disbursements as early as 
October through a staff-monitored program. 
 
7. (SBU) Several donors expressed their short-term concerns 
about the state of Malawi\'s economy between now and the time 
Fund disbursements could take place, and there was some 
discussion of the feasibility of donors de-linking their 
direct budgetary support programs from the IMF and 
disbursing now. 
 
8. (SBU) Similarly, others wanted to know if a Letter of 
Assessment from the Fund would be sufficiently strong to 
enable the World Bank to go forward with its Structural 
Adjustment Credit before the Fund itself makes 
disbursements.  The Fund, Nowak stressed, has to provide 
honest assessments of a country\'s performance, despite what 
implications those assessments may have. Expressing some 
discomfort with the way other donors piggy-back on the Fund, 
Nowak pointed out that \"we are not a credit rating agency.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
9.  (SBU) The IMF has had a rough ride with Malawi over the 
past year, but we think they have struck the right balance 
with the current approach.  Malawi needs aid, and 
Mutharika\'s government represents a new chance to get the 
IMF program on track without compromising the program\'s 
integrity.  Given Malawi\'s poor past performance, however, 
disbursements cannot follow mere promises.  Whatever program 
form it takes, we (along with other donors) would like to 
see the Mutharika government be given a chance to quickly 
show its commitment (or lack thereof) to reform and to 
fiscal discipline, because aid, and growth, will only be 
able to follow where the government\'s performance leads.

Direct Agreement with Malawi had not been signed (reftel). 
Chinsinga said the relevant ministries (Transport, Justice,

and confirmed that former President Muluzi had ordered it be 
signed two weeks before the May 20 elections.  Concerned to 
learn from a June 8 letter from OPIC that there was no basis

he planned to do all in his power \"to facilitate the signing

SUBJECT: FINAL PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS RESULTS ANNOUNCED 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. The results of the three parliamentary districts with 
outstanding results, announced on June 4, change the 
composition of Parliament very little.  The Malawi 
Congress Party and the United Democratic Front both 
added one to their totals.  The third seat went to an 
independent.  At present, the House is eight shy of its 
full compliment, pending by-elections, which should be 
conducted within 90 days after the May 20 general 
elections.  At the first session of Parliament, which 
must convene before July 5, a Speaker will be elected 
and a 2004-05 national budget approved.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. The Malawi Electoral Commission announced on June 4 
the results of the three parliamentary districts where 
\"investigations\" into vote counting had to be conducted. 
With the recently announced results, the Malawi Congress 
Party (MCP) has 57 MPs; the United Democratic Front 
(UDF) has 50 MPs; and there are 40 independent MPs. 
 
3. On June 8, Chief Justice Leonard Unyolo concluded 
swearing in 182 of the 185 newly elected Members of 
Parliament.  Three of the MPs did not take their oath 
because one was absent; another was recuperating in the 
hospital after a car accident; and the third MP\'s 
victory is being challenged in court. 
 
4. The 193-member House will be complete after the eight 
by-elections, six in districts where elections did not 
occur for various reasons and two in the districts of 
the newly-elected President and Vice President, who are 
barred from holding two public offices simultaneously. 
 
5. Deputy Clerk of Parliament Stanslas Chisanu confirmed 
that the Speaker of Parliament will be elected during 
the first session, which is mandated to occur within 45 
days after the elections (by July 5). The principal 
business of the first session will be discussion and 
approval of the 2004-05 national budget.

REF: LILONGWE 457 
 
1. SUMMARY. More than three weeks after elections, President 
Bingu wa Mutharika finally announced his cabinet on June 13. 
With 21 senior ministers (including the President and Vice 
President) and 8 deputy ministers, Mutharika failed in his 
attempt to reduce the size of the cabinet to 20.  In an 
effort to forge a working majority in parliament (a work very 
much still in progress), Mutharika was compelled to include 
ministers from four minor parties.  He also had to balance 
his desire to streamline the cabinet with the need to 
maintain harmony in the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) 
which is chaired and controlled by former president Bakili 
Muluzi.  The 29-member cabinet is nevertheless an improvement 
from the bloated 46-member cabinet of the prior government. 
Cabinet members will be sworn in on June 16 in Blantyre.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.   Secretary to the President and Cabinet Bright Msaka on 
June 13 announced the composition of President Mutharika\'s 
cabinet. According to Msaka, the new appointments take into 
consideration individual merit and professional competence, 
as well as the recent memorandum of understanding between 
ruling and opposition parties. Other factors were religion, 
gender balance, and development and foreign policy goals. 
 
3.  President Mutharika will serve as Minister responsible 
for Defense and the Civil Service.  Vice President Cassim 
Chilumpha will assume the portfolio of Minister for Statutory 
Corporations.  There will be no position of second vice 
president, though former second vice president Chakufwa 
Chihana will retain his position as Minister of Agriculture. 
The new cabinet includes three members of the Republican 
Party (RP), two members of the Alliance for Democracy 
(AFORD), and one member each from Movement for Genuine 
Democratic Change (MGODE) and the New Congress for Democracy 
(NCD).

SUBJECT: SADC TEAM ALONE IN PRAISING MALAWI\'S ELECTIONS 
 
REF: LILONGWE 445 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (U) The SADC Election Observer Team (SEOT) stood alone in 
its failure to find fault with Malawi\'s May 20 elections, and 
unlike all other observer missions deemed the elections as 
\"free and fair and credible\" according to a preliminary 
statement. African Union (AU), Commonwealth, European Union 
(EU), Electoral Institute of Southern Africa (EISA), and SADC 
Parliamentary Forum (SADC-PF) observers pointed out 
deficiencies in the electoral process and distanced 
themselves from public declarations of \"free and fair\" 
elections. 
 
SADC - A TALE OF TWO OBSERVER MISSIONS 
-------------------------------------- 
2.  (U) Two missions from SADC were in Malawi to observe 
elections: SADC-PF and the SADC Election Observer Team 
(SEOT), organized by the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence, and 
Security Cooperation. In an official statement, the 
Parliamentary Forum pointed out a number of shortcomings, in 
particular the failure of state-controlled media to allow 
equitable access for opposition parties.   The Malawi 
Electoral Commission (MEC) was, according to SADC-PF, 
overstretched, and the statement included a long list of 
recommended improvements.  Notably, the team  declined to 
comment on the level of freedom, fairness, and credibility of 
Malawi\'s elections. 
 
3.  (U) SEOT, however, praised the election. SEOT\'s 
statement, issued on May 21 (note: two days before official 
results were announced) deemed the voting process \"free and 
fair and credible in terms of transparency and accepted 
electoral practices\" and praised the MEC\'s overall management 
of the elections.  It urged stakeholders to accept the (then 
still unannounced) final results, calling them a \"true 
reflection of the wishes of the people of Malawi, committed 
to further consolidation of peace, stability, freedom and 
democracy in this sister country and full member of the SADC.\" 
 
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? 
---------------------- 
4.  (U) Statements from other observer missions, including 
the AU, EU, Commonwealth, and EISA were uniformly critical in 
their analysis of the elections.  While all missions noted 
that the elections were peaceful, they also made pointed 
remarks about unfair media coverage, irregularities in the 
voters\' roll, use of state resources by the ruling party, and 
various other issues (reftel). The AU statement referred to 
the language during the campaign as \"intimidating, 
provocative and insulting\" and deemed the practice of 
handouts disturbing. (note: Candidates, particularly those in 
the ruling party, commonly distributed cash and food at 
political rallies.)  The EISA statement blasted the media\'s 
treatment of the campaigns as unbalanced and notes that the 
MEC is widely perceived as partisan. The EU statement went 
further in such criticism, citing specific examples of media 
and MEC bias, while the Commonwealth couched its praise for 
the polling staff by pointing out that there were \"serious 
inadequacies in the registration process\" and \"grave concern\" 
about the \"misuse of the advantages of incumbency.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (SBU) Of all the international and diplomatic observer 
missions, only the SADC Election Observer Team found no 
substantial fault with Malawi\'s elections, bringing into 
question SADC\'s objectivity in its peer review of member 
states.  In praising Malawi\'s dubious performance, the team 
demonstrated SADC\'s unfortunate proclivity to close ranks 
behind its members no matter what the issue and what the 
truth.

1. Vice-President Cassim Chilumpha has described the death 
of former President Reagan as a great loss not only to the 
United States but also to the whole world. On June 14, upon 
returning from funeral services in the U.S. (reftel A), 
Chilumpha said Reagan was well known for his fight to end 
communism - a development that indirectly brought changes to 
Malawi. Chilumpha characterized Reagan as one of the world\'s 
greatest leaders. 
 
BEGIN QUOTE: \"Let\'s remember that President Ronald Reagan in 
the late eighties and early nineties together with Margaret 
Thatcher are the two people that worked tirelessly to see 
the end of communism. They also fought for human rights and 
this helped us in Malawi to fight a dictatorship of the 
former one party regime. Some people didn\'t know this 
connection. We must remember that donor countries helped 
Malawi by putting pressure on the one party regime and the 
result was freedom and democracy in Malawi.\" END QUOTE. 
 
2.  Chilumpha noted that the decision for him to attend the 
funeral in the U.S. was made by President Mutharika based on 
the cordial bilateral relationship enjoyed by United States 
and Malawi. The Vice-President said he also used the trip to 
meet leaders of countries that have bilateral ties with 
Malawi such as British Prime Minister Blair, German 
Chancellor Schroeder, and Secretary of State Powell. 
Chilumpha said he briefed them on the May general election 
in Malawi and about plans of the new government.

SUBJECT: NEW FINANCE MINISTER BRIEFS DONORS ON PLANS TO GET 
MALAWI BACK ON TRACK 
 
REF: LILONGWE 503 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  Two days after being sworn in, new finance 
minister Goodall Gondwe briefed donor heads of mission of his 
plans to get Malawi back on track with the international 
financial institutions; indicated that Malawi is entering 
into an IMF staff-monitored program; made a pitch for early 
disbursements by the World Bank and other donors; discussed 
plans for the new budget; and promised greater transparency 
and regular communication with donors.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) At a two-hour meeting in Lilongwe on June 18, 
Finance Minister Goodall Gondwe spelled out his immediate 
plans to extricate Malawi from its dire economic situation. 
He promised to hold regular meetings with donors, as often as 
on a monthly basis.  He asked that his discussions with 
donors be confidential and that information shared 
(including, he hopes, expenditure data on 
ministry-by-ministry basis) be considered privileged.  He 
specifically asked that information not be shared with the 
press. 
 
3.  (SBU) Per reftel, the IMF has agreed to a fast-track 
staff-monitored program with Malawi.  Gondwe said the program 
will run through the end of September, and that it will not 
call for resources from the Fund.  June benchmarks have been 
agreed upon, and Gondwe indicated they focus on wages, other 
recurrent transactions, total expenditures, domestic 
commercial borrowing, and net domestic assets in the Reserve 
Bank.  He added that the Fund would also like to see how the 
new administration\'s move of government functions from 
Blantyre to Lilongwe is being conducted.  Gondwe said that 
\"unlike in the past,\" the GOM had taken a substantial part in 
determining targets.  \"We think the targets are fair and 
attainable;  if we don\'t attain them, there\'s something very 
wrong.\" 
 
4.  (SBU) Gondwe said there would be a Fund mission in the 
first or second week of July with three objectives:  to 
determine how the GOM has fared on the June benchmarks; to 
conduct Article Four consultations; and to discuss a 
staff-monitored program of 3-4 months duration. 
 
5.  (SBU) If Malawi performs \"robustly well\" on the June 
targets, Gondwe hopes that a Letter of Assessment from the 
Fund will enable the World Bank (\"and others, I suppose\") to 
decide whether or not to disburse.  The Bank\'s Country 
Manager said the Bank will \"look at its position in late 
July.\"  He later added that he hopes for support from the USG. 
 
6.  (SBU) Gondwe\'s principal secretary at the Ministry said 
that in lieu of a new budget, the GOM will use Provisional 
Warrants from the beginning of the new fiscal year in July 
for a period of three to four months.  Ministries will be 
advised of ceilings on their spending, and will then be asked 
to submit their prioritized spending plans.  Gondwe admitted 
that the next budget will be \"very difficult.\"  He mentioned 
problem areas including interest payments on treasury bills; 
the need to reform the civil service wage structure (which 
could lead to an incremental increase); and how to implement 
presidential initiatives (such as fertilizer subsidies). 
 
7.  (SBU) During the briefing, Gondwe twice referred to his 
recent meeting in Washington at Treasury with U/S Taylor.  He 
advised that there was a perception at Treasury that the Fund 
had too often changed targets for Malawi.  He also said that 
U/S Taylor had indicated USG support of World Bank 
disbursement of its Structural Agreement Credit so long as 
the IMF is satisfied with GOM performance. 
 
8.  (SBU)  Comment:  Gondwe started off on the right foot, 
but clearly realizes the daunting challenge ahead of him. 
His recovery scenario definitely includes early World Bank 
disbursements.  (Though he would also like to see early 
direct budgetary support from bilateral donors, he was 
advised that such support will not be considered for several 
months.)  Without Bank disbursements soon, he is 
(understandably) concerned there could be a rapid fall in the 
kwacha.  He knows the GOM must perform now if it wants to get 
back on track.  The question is whether he and President 
Mutharika can first dig Malawi out of the hole dug by the 
previous government, and then impose fiscal discipline on a 
bureaucracy which historically has resisted it.  End summary.

SUBJECT: UDF OBTAINS MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT; MULUZI 
INCREASES INFLUENCE OVER MUTHARIKA 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) With the June 18 announcement that the National 
Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the ruling United Democratic 
Front (UDF) have formed an alliance, the UDF (owing primarily 
to Chairman Bakili Muluzi\'s political maneuvering) has 
successfully secured a majority in Parliament and overcome 
the opposition.  As kingpin of the deals in the House, former 
President Muluzi has deepened his influence over President 
Bingu wa Mutharika while garnering support for 
Muluzi-loyalist Rodwell Munyenyembe as Speaker.  Scheduled to 
convene June 28, Parliament will elect a Speaker and Deputies 
before Mutharika officially opens the session on June 29. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
NDA AND UDF FORM AN ALLIANCE 
---------------------------- 
2. (U) National Democratic Alliance (NDA) President Brown 
Mpinganjira and ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) party 
chairman Bakili Muluzi announced on June 18 at Muluzi\'s 
Blantyre residence that the two parties had agreed to form an 
alliance \"for the sake of national unity.\"  At the time of 
the announcement, no formal MOU had been signed, and a 
technical committee was reported to be working out the 
details.  Mpinganjira said the NDA joined the UDF because it 
wanted to actively participate in \"national development,\" and 
he claimed he has received no \"material benefits\" from the 
alliance.  President Bingu wa Mutharika was notably absent 
from the press conference. 
 
UDF\'S MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT 
---------------------------- 
3. (SBU) With the NDA\'s 8 seats in Parliament, the UDF has 
the support of 105 parliamentarians, 8 more than the simple 
majority required to pass legislation in the 193 member 
house.  Thanks to Muluzi\'s politicking, the UDF\'s majority is 
supported by 6 different political parties and 22 independent 
MPs. 
 
4. (SBU) UDF Spokesperson Ken Lipenga told the media on June 
20 that the UDF will support Rodwell Munyenyembe, who was 
elected the House\'s first Speaker in 1994, as the party\'s 
candidate for Speaker.  The Malawi Congress Party (MCP), 
leading opposition party with 57 parliamentary seats, has 
said its candidate will be Louis Chimango.  (COMMENT: After 
Munyenyembe lost his parliamentary seat in 1999, he defected 
from the Alliance for Democracy to the UDF.  Since then, he 
has been a Muluzi loyalist, serving in high-ranking cabinet 
positions throughout Muluzi\'s second term, most recently as 
Minister of Defense.  END COMMENT.) 
 
FIRST SESSION OF THE HOUSE 
-------------------------- 
5. (SBU) Clerk of Parliament Roosevelt Gondwe told polfsn the 
election of the Speaker and Deputies will take place the 
morning of June 28.  The President will officially open the 
session with an address on the morning of June 29.  A 
constitutionally-mandated 5 days of debate on the President\'s 
comments will follow.  The House will then begin regular 
business. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (SBU) With the conclusion of an alliance with once 
arch-enemy Brown Mpinganjira and the NDA after earlier 
cementing an alliance with Gwanda Chakuamba and his Republic 
Party, Muluzi and the UDF have effectively trumped the 
opposition.  Several parties that vowed never to work 
together have aligned themselves with the UDF, and Muluzi is 
clearly the kingpin.  With Mutharika dependent on a working 
majority in Parliament, Muluzi has increased his influence 
over Mutharika.  END COMMENT.

REF: LILONGWE 45 
 
1. (U) In an attempt to reduce load-shedding and power cuts 
caused by aquatic weeds clogging hydroelectric power 
stations, the Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi, 
Limited (ESCOM) has purchased a USD 795,000 aquatic weeds 
control system from American corporation Aquarius Systems 
(Aquarius).  ESCOM, which recently took over management of 
the weed problem for the Ministry of Transport and Public 
Works, had been paying approximately USD 26,000 per month to 
remove and dispose of the weeds.  ESCOM officials have said 
they see the purchase of the AS equipment as a medium-term 
answer to the problem, and they will continue to advocate for 
the GOM to seek a sustainable solution. 
 
2. (SBU) Aquarius representatives, whom post alerted to the 
situation in 2001, have confirmed that ESCOM plans to 
purchase a Swamp Devil Aquatic Vegetation Cutter, H-620 
Aquatic Plant Harvester, a trailer conveyor, shore conveyor, 
boom material, spare parts, work boat, truck, and three 
months on-site training.  The equipment, according to 
Aquarius, has a lifetime of at least 10 years, if properly 
maintained.  Aquarius representatives also said ESCOM is 
planning to use an Ex-Im Bank financing for one year, which 
they are organizing through an American bank in Milwaukee. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (SBU) Continued load-shedding and blackouts have hindered 
economic development, and ESCOM\'s decision to engage more 
fully on this critical situation will provide much needed 
stability to Malawi\'s energy supply problems.  Post, however, 
still sees OES\'s pending Integrated Management of the Lake 
Malawi/Niassa/Nyasa Basin as an opportunity to find a 
long-term, sustainable solution to this problem, while also 
promoting general cooperation and coordination among the 
three nations bordering the lake.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: CORRUPTION FEATHERS EX-PRESIDENT\'S NEST 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU/NF) Taking office in 1994 with a couple of 
nearly bankrupt businesses, former President Bakili 
Muluzi finished his ten years in the presidency as one 
of the richest men in Malawi. That he acquired his 
fortune while officially earning an annual salary of USD 
56,000 (MK 6 million) demonstrates how corruption and 
influence peddling are becoming commonplace in Malawi. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
MULUZI BEFORE PRESIDENCY 
------------------------ 
2. (U) Former President Bakili Muluzi was elected to 
office in June 1994 and was re-elected for his second 
and final five-year term in 1999.  His handpicked 
successor, Bingu wa Mutharika, was elected in May 2004. 
 
3. (SBU/NF) When he assumed office in 1994, Muluzi owned 
some businesses trading in sugar and farming. His 
passenger transport business had just closed down, and 
the sugar distribution business was almost bankrupt. His 
businesses failed to honor debts, and several clients 
issued court claims against him. His assets were 
estimated to be worth less than USD one million. 
 
Muluzi After Serving Ten Years as President 
------------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU/NF) Muluzi left office a far richer man - some 
say the richest citizen of Malawi. His sugar 
distribution business is the largest in the country, and 
he has built several houses, including two very large 
residences (one in his home village and another in 
Blantyre). Real estate agents estimate his two mansions 
are worth more than USD one million. Muluzi has also 
established a Holding Company called Atupele Holdings, 
which owns several properties including the Keza Office 
Building built at a cost of USD 3.67 million. Not 
coincidentally, before construction on Keza was even 
complete, the Malawi Revenue Authority rented it, paying 
in advance for five years of occupancy. 
 
5. (SBU/NF) Muluzi is connected to seven other companies 
either through sole ownership or by partnerships.  The 
three most well-known are Alkay Plastics Ltd, Transcom 
Ltd, and Chikale Hills. Alkay Plastics Ltd is the 
largest manufacturer of plastic products in Malawi and 
has established export markets in neighboring countries. 
Transcom Ltd, established during the last three years of 
Muluzi\'s presidency, owns more than 130 trucks of 
various sizes (10-60 ton trucks) for domestic and 
international cargo haulage.  Muluzi also owns Chikale 
Hills, a transport company of unknown size but with a 
large presence in Malawi. 
 
6. (SBU/NF) Muluzi also partnered with other individuals 
to establish Fertilizer Financing Company, Kalaria 
Wholesalers, and African Logistics Company. It is widely 
speculated that Muluzi used these business partners to 
hide his wealth. 
 
THE TOP SETS THE TREND 
---------------------- 
7. (SBU/NF) During Muluzi\'s ten-year tenure, corruption 
became more widespread in almost all sectors of Malawi. 
The civil service, police, and immigration often require 
\"tips\" for routine services, and people publicly talk of 
bribing the police to avoid arrest for both minor and 
serious offences.  These trends led to Malawi\'s position 
on the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions 
Index dropping from 45 in 1999 to position 83 in 2003. 
(NOTE: Corruption is one of the primary factors that 
kept Malawi from qualifying as an MCA country.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (SBU/NF) Corruption is not the accepted norm (yet), 
and it is certainly not at the level of many countries 
in Africa.  President Mutharika has come out strongly 
against corruption by his \"zero tolerance\" policy and by 
his plans to investigate all reported cases -- even at 
\"the highest levels.\" His words, however, will have to 
be met with action in order to stem corruption\'s 
corrosive effects on Malawian gove

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) With a narrow margin of victory, United Democratic 
Front (UDF) MP Rodwell Munyenyembe was elected Speaker of the 
National Assembly on June 28.  The House also elected First 
and Second Deputies, both of whom are pro-UDF.  President 
Bingu wa Mutharika, in his first address to Parliament on 
June 29, sounded his now familiar refrain of moving the 
nation \"from poverty to prosperity.\"  Echoing themes made at 
his inaugural address, Mutharika explained how each ministry 
will play its part in his administration\'s goal of reforming 
the public, private, agricultural, and civil service sectors. 
 Well received by most Malawians, Mutharika\'s policy 
statements have invoked a \"wait-and-see\" attitude from 
political commentators and the donor community. (Bio 
information on Munyenyembe begins in paragraph 6.)  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
MUNYENYEMBE ELECTED SPEAKER 
--------------------------- 
2. (SBU) In a tangible demonstration of the ruling United 
Democratic Front\'s (UDF) slim working majority in Parliament, 
UDF MP Rodwell Munyenyembe was elected Speaker of the 
National Assembly on June 28, defeating Malawi Congress Party 
(MCP) MP Louis Chimango 99 to 83 (reftel A).  Republican 
Party (RP) MP Esther Chilenje was elected First Deputy 
Speaker, and independent MP Jones Chingola was elected Second 
Deputy Speaker.  All three support the ruling UDF\'s 
\"government of national unity.\"  (NOTE: During the leadership 
elections in the 193-member house, two parliamentarians were 
absent, and eight seats were vacant pending by-elections.  In 
the vote for the Speaker, one ballot was spoiled and declared 
\"null and void.\"  END NOTE.) 
 
MUTHARIKA\'S NOW FAMILIAR REFRAIN 
-------------------------------- 
3. (SBU) On June 29 President Bingu wa Mutharika began his 
first address to Parliament by carefully listing campaign 
promises he has kept, including reduction of the size of the 
cabinet, his administration\'s focus on economic reform, and 
transfer of the presidency and ministries to Lilongwe (from 
Malawi\'s commercial capital, Blantyre).  In addition to 
reminding the nation that he is keeping his campaign 
promises, Mutharika reprised familiar themes from his 
inaugural address (reftel C) and his first meeting with the 
donor heads-of-mission (reftel B).  Highlighting his 
administration\'s self-dubbed tag-line  \"from poverty to 
prosperity,\" Mutharika focused his remarks on how the 
ministries will fulfill his goal of reforming the public, 
private, agricultural, and civil service sectors. 
 
4. (SBU) The only comment to elicit applause from the 
assembled government officials was a reiteration of his 
\"zero-tolerance policy\" against corruption. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) Mutharika has gotten good mileage out of his current 
message, and it is generally well received by Malawians. 
Political commentators and the donor community, who remember 
similar promises by newly-elected President Bakili Muluzi in 
1994, have adopted a \"wait-and-see\" attitude toward 
Mutharika\'s policies.  Mutharika\'s reforms come with a price, 
and his administration will have to balance implementation of 
those reforms with a need for strict fiscal discipline.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
------------------------------------ 
BIO INFORMATION: Rodwell Munyenyembe 
------------------------------------ 
6. (C) Originally an educator, Munyenyembe has had a long 
political career, serving in several ministerial positions 
both before and after Malawi\'s transition to multi-party 
democracy.  Once among the most active, intelligent, and 
hardworking ministers, Munyenyembe\'s influence and drive have 
diminished significantly with age.  Munyenyembe re-gained his 
parliamentary constituency in the 2004 elections and was 
elected Speaker of the National Assembly on June 28, 2004. 
He is largely perceived to be a loyalist of former President 
(and current chair of the ruling United Democratic Front) 
Bakili Muluzi, which is likely the reason the party selected 
him for the Speakership. 
 
Munyenyembe in Multiparty Democracy 
----------------------------------- 
7. (C) Munyenyembe was a founding member of the Alliance for 
Democracy (AFORD) opposition party and was elected to 
Parliament in Malawi\'s first multiparty elections in 1994. 
He was unanimously elected Speaker when Parliament met for 
the first time in late June 1994.  He has since distanced 
himself from AFORD and ran as an independent candidate in 
June 1999 and was defeated. 
 
8. (C) After losing his parliamentary constituency, 
then-President Muluzi appointed him Minister of State for 
Presidential Affairs.  He was later appointed Minister of 
Defense, where he remained through the end of Muluzi\'s second 
and final term as President.  He was not very active as 
Minister of Defense and had little engagement with the Malawi 
Defense Force. 
 
9. (SBU) At the UDF convention in August 2003, Munyenyembe, 
the convention\'s organizer, was defeated in his bid for the 
Second Vice Presidency of the party.  In the 2004 
parliamentary elections, he contested and re-won his Chitipia 
parliamentary constituency. 
 
Under the Banda Regime 
---------------------- 
10. (C) Munyenyembe headed several ministries in Banda\'s 
government from 1963 to 1977 and represented Malawi at the UN 
General Assembly in 1975 and at the OAU in 1976.  His 
political banishment occurred in 1977 when he was first 
\"transferred\" from his position as Malawi Congress Party 
(MCP) Secretary General and Administrative Secretary to serve 
as Minister of Education, and then later he was odd-man-out 
in a cabinet reshuffle which, according to some, was staged 
to facilitate his exit from Government.  Republican Party 
president Gwanda Chakuamba and Malawi Congress Party 
president John Tembo were allegedly involved in Munyenyembe\'s 
ouster. 
 
Personal Data 
------------- 
11. (C) A northerner from Chitipa District, Munyenyembe was 
born in 1936.  He studied at Livingstonia and then at Domasi 
Teacher Training College, before beginning his career as a 
primary school teacher.  He earned a certificate for teaching 
the deaf from Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK in 
1966 and a technical certificate in audiometrics from the 
University of London in 1967.  Munyenyembe retains his 
interest in education for the deaf. He is a devout Roman 
Catholic, is married, and has 12 children.

     B. LILONGWE 514 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY.   Dr. George Chaponda, Malawi\'s new Minister 
of Foreign Affairs was sworn in on June 16 (reftel A). 
Chaponda, after nearly twenty years of UNHCR service, seems 
eager to raise standards of professionalism and fiscal 
discipline in his ministry, and would like to explore the 
possibility of establishing a Malawi mission to the UN in 
Geneva.  Chaponda anticipates progress on the Nacala Corridor 
project and looks forward to working with the USG in his 
efforts to reduce poverty and increase economic growth in 
Malawi. Biographical information begins in paragraph 6. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) On June 28, CDA paid an introductory call to new 
Minister of Foreign Affairs George Chaponda. Accompanied by 
DCM and Poloff (notetaker), the CDA\'s visit served as post\'s 
introduction to the minister.  Chaponda, an experienced UN 
diplomat, said that the new GOM intends to professionalize 
and streamline it\'s diplomatic corps.  He said he is 
interested in ensuring that GOM embassies abroad \"are 
proactive in promoting trade, investment, and tourism.\" 
Chaponda did not give any indication of the veracity of 
recent rumors that the GOM may soon begin closing embassies 
as a cost-saving measure, though he did indicate that he 
would be in favor of possible consolidation or downsizing. 
Chaponda indicated that the GOM would like the chance to use 
whatever \"incentives\" may be available in order to establish 
a mission to the UN in Geneva, noting that he had previously 
advocated for this, and would continue to do so even if it 
means folding an existing embassy nearby into a new one in 
Geneva. 
 
3.  (U) When asked about GOM delays in signing a Direct 
Agreement with OPIC which would guarantee a $30 million loan 
to rehabilitate the Nacala Corridor (reftel B), Chaponda said 
he \"didn\'t see any problem with it moving forward.\"  He 
believed that GOM resolution was forthcoming, and assured CDA 
he would pass along to the Minister of Trade the USG\'s desire 
to see the project completed. 
 
4.  (U) Chaponda expressed his eagerness to work in 
partnership with the USG in order to achieve President 
Mutharika\'s goals of reducing poverty and increasing economic 
growth in Malawi.  Recalling his extensive personal knowledge 
of the long association between the USG and GOM, he cited the 
Peace Corps as a valuable component of USG assistance. He 
said he regretted that a scheduling conflict (Chaponda 
departed Malawi on June 29 for the AU conference in Addis 
Ababa) would prevent his attendance at the mission\'s official 
Independence Day celebration on July 1. He added that he is 
planning to attend the upcoming UNGA, and said that President 
Mutharika may do so as well (reported septel). 
 
5.  (SBU) COMMENT. Chaponda\'s extensive international 
experience and substantial education are readily apparent. 
He gave the impression he is engaged, articulate, and 
generally friendly to the USG.  His educational and 
professional experience have allowed him to live and work in 
the US, and he seemed eager to maintain strong ties with the 
USG in his ministerial role. His support of President 
Mutharika was also on display, as Chaponda repeatedly 
referred to the President\'s economic goals.  We expect 
Chaponda will be a competent, articulate, and loyal public 
servant as Minister of Foreign Affairs. END COMMENT. 
 
 
BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION: DR. GEORGE CHAPONDA 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Chaponda, a newcomer to Malawian politics and the 
United Democratic Front (UDF) inner circle, entered Malawi\'s 
political scene in 2003 when he contested and won the 
position of the party\'s Director of Research, defeating 
former UDF heavyweight and then Minister of Lands Thengo 
Maloya.  In the 2004 presidential and parliamentary 
elections, Chaponda won a parliamentary seat in Mulanje and 
became Minister of Foreign Affairs in newly-elected President 
Bingu wa Mutharika\'s cabinet.  As a retired UN official, he 
has extensive international experience.  Close associates 
describe him as a quiet and thoughtful man. 
 
7. (U)  Chaponda worked for UNHCR for nearly twenty years 
before retiring in 2002. His UNHCR assignments included Head 
of Legal Section in Mogadishu (1983-1985); Deputy 
Representative to Kenya (1985-1989); Head of Legal Section in 
Bangkok (1989-1992); Deputy Representative to Bangladesh 
(1993-1994); Chief of Section for Recruitment and Emergency 
Staffing, Geneva (1994-1995); Head of Sub-Office in Ngara, 
Tanzania (1995-1996);  Deputy Regional Representative, 
Austria (1996-1998); Resident Representative, Poland 
(1998-2000).  In 2002 Chaponda served as UNHCR Deputy 
Regional Director, East and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes 
Region, based in Addis Ababa.  Concurrent with his 
ministerial position, he is also serving as the UDF\'s 
Director of Research. 
 
8. (U) Chaponda spent much of his youth in Zambia.  After 
attending Blantyre Secondary School in Malawi, he completed a 
B.A. and M.A. in Political Science/History at the University 
of New Delhi in India.  He then completed a law degree in 
Zambia, and obtained his JD at Yale School of Law in 1984. 
While working at Yale as a visiting lecturer, he was 
recruited by UNHCR. 
 
9. (SBU) Chaponda is from the same Lomwe ethnic group as 
President Mutharika.  They both hail from Mulanje District in 
the Southern Region. 
 
10. (SBU) Chaponda is the uncle of former National Democratic 
Alliance (NDA) member of Parliament Lizzie Mpinganjira, who 
is the wife of NDA president and former presidential 
candidate Brown Mpinganjira.

DISBURSEMENT

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) Minister of Finance Goodall Gondwe, in an introductory 
call with the Charge on July 2, made a direct request for the 
USG to support disbursement of Malawi\'s World Bank Structural 
Adjustment Credit (SAC) and for an expert economist to be 
imbedded into the Ministry of Finance.  Gondwe argued that 
the USD 25 million in SAC support in and of itself was not as 
important as debt re-payment, reduction of interest rates, 
and mopping up of excess liquidity that would result from the 
disbursement.  Regarding Malawi\'s economy, Gondwe remains 
optimistic because he \"knows where (the GOM) went wrong,\" and 
he plans to bring the new administration \"back to the basics 
of expenditure control.\"  New to his position, Gondwe is an 
experienced economist who knows how the international 
financial institutions (and their constituent governments) 
operate.  (Biographical information on Gondwe begins in 
paragraph 8.)  END SUMMARY. 
 
WHERE WE WENT WRONG 
------------------- 
2. (C) Newly appointed Minister of Finance Goodall Gondwe 
told the Charge and DCM at a July 2 introductory call that he 
knows his job is not \"impossible\" because he knows \"where 
(the GOM) went wrong.\"  Conceding that former President 
Muluzi\'s administration had \"ignored the rules of the game 
and cut corners,\" Gondwe said he plans to bring the GOM \"back 
to the basics on expenditure control.\"  At the Charge\'s 
prompting, Gondwe explained that one good example is the 
reduction of Malawi\'s National Day celebration budget from 
USD 650,000 (MK 70 million) to USD 140,000 (MK 15 million), 
which Gondwe suggested to the President.  Gondwe also said he 
dealt with the recent demand by parliamentarians for a 
three-fold salary and benefits increase by suggesting a 
survey of parliamentary salaries in countries with similar 
GDPs, knowing that legislators in such countries are paid 
much less than the proposed amount. 
 
AN UNVEILED REQUEST FOR USG SUPPORT 
----------------------------------- 
3. (C) Gondwe told the Charge that, while he was not trying 
\"to flatter the USG,\" the USG\'s support in favor of 
disbursing Malawi\'s World Bank Structural Adjustment Credit 
(SAC) is crucial.  Without a disbursement soon, he said, 
interest rates would not go down and the GOM would not be 
able to do what it needs to do to set Malawi\'s economy back 
on the right course.  Gondwe explained that the financial 
support of USD 25 million in and of itself was not as 
significant as a start on debt re-payment, the reduction in 
interest rates, and the mopping up of excess liquidity that 
would occur as a result of the disbursement. 
 
4. (C) \"As a former IMF employee,\" Gondwe conceded he 
\"understood Malawi\'s track record was not long enough\" to 
ordinarily merit disbursement.  He hoped, however, that the 
Embassy would weigh in on the discussion and communicate the 
\"time bomb\" there currently is with Malawi\'s economy, as it 
could \"get much worse soon.\" 
 
ONE ADDITIONAL REQUEST 
---------------------- 
5. (C) At a time when the Ministry needs to be at its best, 
Gondwe noted that its effectiveness is lagging because staff 
morale is so low.  In an effort to revive \"sound management 
and discipline,\" Gondwe said he was looking for a long-term 
expert economist to \"work on the line\" as a deputy in 
Economic Affairs.  Gondwe requested the USG consider filling 
such a position in the Ministry. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (C) Gondwe knows that the fastest way to get the SAC 
disbursement is to work the issue from both the economic and 
political angles, and he is good at both.  We are encouraged 
by the Minister\'s initial steps to set the economy back on 
track, but tangible evidence of those steps will not come 
until the IMF team makes its mid-July visit and assessment. 
In the meantime, Gondwe is likely to make his best efforts to 
control the GOM\'s expenditure and fight the pressure excess 
liquidity is putting on the exchange rate and inflation. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: Gondwe\'s suggestion to imbed an 
expert economist in the Ministry is a good one, and we think 
both the Ministry and the USG would benefit from such an 
arrangement.  We intend to explore avenues of making it 
happen.  END COMMENT. 
 
BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION: DR. GOODALL GONDWE 
-------------------------------------------- 
8. (C) Urbane and sophisticated, Gondwe has spent much of his 
life outside of Malawi as an international civil servant.  He 
returned to Malawi in September 2002 to take over a new 
position advising President Muluzi on economic matters, 
particularly programs related to the World Bank and IMF.  A 
longtime friend of President Mutharika\'s, Gondwe became 
Minister of Finance in Mutharika\'s new government on June 16. 
 
9. (C) Gondwe rose rapidly in his early career in Malawi and 
was appointed General Manager of the Reserve Bank in 1970, at 
age 31, only to see his appointment vetoed by President 
Banda.  He made a fresh start at the Ministry of Finance. 
His time there, however, was limited, and he was demoted to a 
position in the Transport Ministry in 1973 when, caught in a 
bureaucratic intrigue, he took the blame for an incident in 
which President Banda apparently did not feel that he had 
been adequately informed of developments in the Finance 
Ministry.  With Banda\'s blessing, Gondwe moved on to a 
position outside Malawi at the African Development Bank. 
10. (C) Gondwe\'s 2002 return to Malawi coincided with a GOM 
push to get back on track with its IMF program.  Several IMF 
team members expressed the opinion that Gondwe was taken on 
with the express purpose of managing the Fund.  Under 
Gondwe\'s influence, relations between the Ministry of Finance 
(in the former Muluzi administration) and visiting IMF 
missions soured somewhat, but contact with the Fund\'s senior 
management has increased. 
 
11. (C) Gondwe is a Northerner, is good-humored, and is both 
an economic and political pragmatist.  He is the younger 
brother of Vincent Gondwe, former Malawi Ambassador to Ghana 
and the U.S. 
 
12. (U) Gondwe is married and has three children.

SUBJECT: MUTHARIKA ASSUMES AID TO RESUME 
 
REF: LILONGWE 614 
 
1. (U) Upon arrival from the African Union Summit in Addis 
Ababa, President Bingu wa Mutharika reportedly told the media 
on July 9 that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had 
written to donor governments, instructing them to resume aid 
because the Fund was pleased with Malawi\'s renewed commitment 
to economic reform.  Indicating that \"dollars should come in 
the next 14 days or so,\"  Mutharika reportedly said the GOM 
\"sees no reason why the British, European Union, and other 
donors should not give us resources.\" 
 
2. (SBU) Referring to a meeting with British Minister of 
African Affairs Chris Mollen, Mutharika said that Mollen 
supported resumption of aid to Malawi and that Malawi would 
receive \"a lion\'s share\" of the new aid the British 
government has promised Africa countries.  Press Officer at 
the British High Commission (BHC) in Lilongwe told poloff 
that no such decision had been made and that the BHC planned 
to have a correction printed. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (SBU) The President\'s statements, while possibly a product 
of sloppy journalism, demonstrate the GOM\'s underlying 
assumption that IFI and direct budgetary support will resume 
in the very near future.  The IMF team arrives on June 14 and 
will present its findings at the end of its two-week visit. 
We find President Mutharika\'s certainty that aid will soon 
resume to be a useful political stance with no clear economic 
underpinning.

REF: HARARE ZI 861 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Officer Peter W. Lord, reasons 1.5 (b/d). 
 
1. (U) The Office of President and Cabinet (OPC) announced on 
July 12 that with immediate effect Deputy Commander Lt. 
General Marko Chiziko will succeed General Joseph Chimbayo as 
Commander of the Malawi Defense Force (MDF).  According to 
the OPC statement, Chimbayo\'s contract finished last month, 
after five years of service as the military\'s Commander. 
(Biographical information on Chiziko to follow septel.) 
 
2. (SBU) Officials at the MDF told poloff that Chimbayo has 
decided to retire from military service, rather than take 
another civilian position in government as previous 
Commanders have done.  Although the change of command took 
effect immediately, the MDF plans to have an official 
hand-over ceremony in the coming weeks. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (C) Chiziko is a seasoned and intelligent officer, and the 
MDF has profited from his leadership as Deputy Commander over 
the past five years.  Very supportive of the USG\'s military 
programs in Malawi, Chiziko was a driving force behind the 
MDF\'s participation in ACRI and ACOTA.  In addition, he has 
dedicated a great deal of time and energy to integrating 
HIV/AIDS care and prevention into the MDF\'s regular training 
programs.  The USG\'s close relations with the MDF will 
strengthen under Chiziko\'s leadership as Commander. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  Although Chimbayo\'s contract may 
not have been extended because of his lack of overt support 
for the ruling party during the elections (reftel), the fact 
that his successor comes from within the ranks demonstrates 
the MDF\'s general apolitical stance and professionalism. 
With the new Deputy Commander yet to be appointed, we 
anticipate a shuffling of senior positions at the MDF.  END

SUBJECT: ALLEGED SUDANESE AL-QAIDA MEMBERS IN BLANTYRE 
 
Classified By: RSO Thomas A. Green 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A call-in on July 9, 2004 claimed that as 
of May five Sudanese al-Qaida members were located in a house 
in Blantyre.  He received this information thirdhand.  His 
source was contacted and stated the same thing.  The 
firsthand source could not be reached.  This information was 
passed to the Malawi Police Service (MPS) for follow-up. 
 
2. (SBU) On July 9, 2004 RSO contacted a Muusa KAUNDA, DPOB: 
20AUG69, Mzuzu, Malawi after he called the Embassy claiming 
to have information on terrorism.  KAUNDA\'s contact numbers 
are 01.634.478, 01.634.475 and 08.878.093.  He is employed at 
King\'s Print, BC 149, Lower Sclatter Road, Hyde Park Building 
in Blantyre.  He stated that he heard from an associate that 
there were Sudanese al-Qaida members living in a house in 
Blantyre as of May, 2004.  He stated he heard this from Esau 
KAMANGA. 
 
3. (SBU) RSO then contacted Esau KAMANGA, DPOB 08SEP58, 
Rutenburg, South Africa.  He stated he is a Malawian citizen 
by birth even though he was born in RSA.  KAMANGA works for 
the secretariat of the Peoples\' Progressive Movement (PPM), a 
political party in Malawi.  KAMANGA was interviewed by telcon 
in Blantyre at 01.636.445 and later at 01.636.475 and stated 
that he heard about the Sudanese from a Mr. MAHANGO (FNU) who 
is/was a security guard at the residence where they are in 
hiding in Blantyre.  KAMANGA stated that the five Sudanese 
are in Malawi to recruit and plan for al-Qaida.  They are 
supposedly being financed by Indians.  He stated MAHANGO 
knows this because MAHANGO used to work for the intelligence 
section of the Malawi Communist Party and is a guard at the 
house.  KAMANGA said he first heard this information when he 
met MAHANGO during the national election in May.  When asked 
why he waited until now to contact the Embassy he said he 
wanted to make sure he was reporting the information to the 
right people. 
 
4. (SBU) Attempts to contact MAHANGO have been negative.  RSO 
was not provided with a telephone point of contact number for 
him, or even a definite address. 
 
5. (SBU) RSO has reported this matter to the Director of 
Criminal Investigation (DCI) for the MPS.  The DCI said he 
would help but expressed concern that his department tread 
very lightly due to the recent tensions over the QUOTE last 
time we had one of these END QUOTE.  (RSO COMMENT:  It is 
believed that the DCI was referring to the Malawi Five 
incident over which there is still lingering hostility on the 
part of some of the public.  END COMMENT.)  The DCI was asked 
to locate and interview MAHANGO, as well as follow-up with 
KAUNDA and KAMANGA to see what their intentions with 
providing this information are. 
 
6. (S/NF) This information has been passed to the regional 
ORCA office for records checks.  Post will report any 
information or results received via Septel. 
 
7. (SBU) RSO ASSESSMENT: This information does NOT/NOT appear 
to be credible.  KAMANGA and KAUNDA appear to believe that 
this MAHANGO is telling the truth.  However, the information 
is at best secondhand, and was most likely fabricated by this 
MAHANGO.  It is unlikely that al-Qaida cell members would be 
so casual about their identities.  During the telcons both 
KAMANGA and KAUNDA were very eager (and repeatedly asked) to 
have RSO come see them to take him to MAHANGO.  This raises 
concerns about possible ulterior motives for reporting the 
information.  KAMANGA also hesitated when asked for his 
mother\'s name, as if he had to think about it before he 
provided it (therefore probably lying to the RSO in the 
process).  Though it is possible that these Sudanese are/were 
in Blant

1. (U) Upon his return from the July 15 Zambezi Water 
Commission (ZAMCOM) signing ceremony, Minister of Mining, 
Natural Resources, and Environment Davis Katsonga said the 
GOM hoped the Commission would help solve the Shire River\'s 
continuing difficulties with water weeds, which are a root 
cause of the current electricity supply problems.  \"When the 
agreement is ratified,\" Katsonga said, \"hopefully in the next 
session of Parliament, Malawi will ask Tanzania to look at 
how the weeds problem can be dealt with from their side.\" 
ZAMCOM, which aims to promote, support, coordinate, and 
harmonize the management and development of water resources 
in the Zambezi watershed, allows signatories \"to accuse or 
call for remedial measures\" if there is mismanagement in 
upstream countries, according to the Minister. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
2. (SBU) ZAMCOM is the first agreement on water resource 
management that Tanzania, Mozambique, and Malawi, the three 
countries that border Lake Malawi/Niassa/Nyasa, have all 
signed.  Although the Commission does not apply specifically 
to the Lake, it should provide an underlying framework for 
engagement on water issues. 
 
3. (SBU) The decision to join ZAMCOM also marks a change in 
the GOM\'s foreign policy regarding the Lake.  Due to concerns 
over territorial and usage rights on the Lake (reftel C), the 
GOM had previously avoided bi-lateral and multi-lateral 
agreements that supported Tanzania\'s claims to actually own 
(rather than to have usage rights of) parts of the Northern 
end of the Lake.  It appears that although the GOM may not 
publicly announce a policy change, the pressing need to 
coordinate on Lake management issues has forced the GOM to 
relax its position.

SUBJECT: INCREASE IN DEPORTEES BEING SENT BACK TO BANGLADESH 
RAISES SECURITY CONCERNS FOR GOM 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A British diplomat seconded to the 
Malawi Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) contacted RSO about a 
group of Bangladeshi males who had recently been deported. 
He stated that Malawi Immigration authorities let most of 
the men pass through Immigration even though they had been 
ordered to detain them.  RSO made contact with both the 
ACB and Immigration and discovered that there has been an 
increase in the instances of Bangladeshis traveling to 
Malawi under false pretenses.  The overriding concern is 
one of alien smuggling and not terrorism, but there is 
great concern that these aliens can obtain fake or 
fraudulently obtained Malawian passports with ease. 
 
2. (SBU) On July 6, 2004 nine Bangladeshi males were 
detained after flying to Lilongwe via an Air Emirates 
flight from Dubai (BG 011), which had been originally 
scheduled to arrive on July 5 but had been delayed due to 
mechanical reasons.  They had originally flown to Dubai 
from Dhaka.  The men all arrived with little, if any 
luggage and with 500 to 800 USD in new one hundred dollar 
bills.  Few could speak English and they said that they 
were in transit to Mozambique.  They did not have Malawian 
visas because they can be applied for at the port of entry 
(POE).  They could not say who paid for their tickets. 
They had used a National Travel Bureau in Dhaka, with 
phone number 12.3.8230.3 to get them. 
 
3. (SBU) The ACB heard that these men were arriving and 
contacted the Immigration Department to have the men 
detained.  Despite orders to hold the men, only four were 
stopped.  The other five were found waiting in a taxi when 
the ACB arrived at the airport.  All nine were taken into 
custody and subsequently deported. 
 
4. (SBU) Malawi Immigration advised that they have such a 
large problem with illegal immigrants from Bangladeshis 
that they have instituted stricter guidelines on letting 
them into the country.  Without proof of a legitimate 
business reason for traveling here all Bangladeshis are 
deported without delay.  Immigration believes these men 
come here so they can get in order to obtain fake Malawian 
passports, which.  This would illallow them to travel to 
the UK for up to six months without a visa.  He feels they 
may also try to get to the United States by first going to 
the UK.  Immigration stated that it is easy to get good 
quality fake passports locally. 
 
5. (SBU) The contact at the ACB advised that it would have 
been easy for the men to get through Immigration as they 
are susceptible to bribery.  ACB and ConOff advised that 
it is easy to get a legitimate Malawi passport for a 
price. 
 
6. (SBU) ConOff advised that it would be easy to spot the 
group since they would not be able to communicate in 
English, which is the predominant language, or Chichewa, 
another commonly spoken local languagethese males as 
engaging in fraud as Malawians speak English, while they 
would not.  Recently issued Malawian passports would also 
raise numerous questions that would need to be answered 
before any US visas were issued. 
 
7. (SBU) Once the Bangladeshis were detained at the 
airport a local immigration lawyer arrived.  He refused to 
provide details as to who contacted him.  The ACB advised 
that the taxi driver outside said that he was supposed to 
take the men to the Crystal Lodge, a hotel in Lilongwe 
that according to one FSN is frequented by both ex-pats 
and locals and is known for prostitution and drug use. 
They are currently investigating this hotel and the 
immigration attorney. 
 
8. (SBU) Copies of the passports were obtained from the 
ACB.  Biographic information on the deportees is as

9. (SBU) SUMMARY: Though these men do not appear to have a 
terrorism connection it should be noted that it is 
possible they could use Malawi as a transit country or 
springboard to other nations.  Once here, they could 
easily obtain travel documents (legitimate or false) and 
then travel on to the United Kingdom or other Commonwealth 
countries.  This could be a possible pre-cursor to 
attempting entry to the United States; an event that 
Immigration officials said was possible and even likely.

1.  Voice of America (VOA) has extended its partnership with 
an independent affiliate, Capital Radio, to bring 
non-government controlled radio broadcast to northern Malawi. 
 On July 19, Ambassador and PAS staff attended the Mzuzu 
launch ceremony of the new station, which significantly 
enhances the availability of unbiased news coverage for the 
region (reftel).  Also in attendance were the station\'s 
executive officers, a VOA representative, the mayor of the 
city of Mzuzu, and various regional business leaders. 
 
2.  Previously, the only radio broadcast in the area was 
Malawi Broadcasting Company (MBC) which has often been 
accused of biased news coverage, particularly during the 
recent presidential elections.  Capital Radio, which is 
independently owned and operated and has had been in 
partnership with VOA since 1998, has a solid reputation for 
presenting unbiased news and generally reliable reporting. 
The partnership with VOA ensures access to an alternative 
radio news source in a country where rural illiteracy and 
poverty limit the effectiveness of other media.

SUBJECT: CHILD LABOR REMAINS AN ISSUE IN MALAWI 
 
REF: STATE 148987 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  One-third of Malawian children aged five to 
seventeen are involved in child labor, according to the 
Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training\'s recently 
released Malawi Child Labour 2002 Report.  The report, 
funded by the United States Department of Labor (USDOL) 
through the International Labour Organization (IOL), 
demonstrates that: 72 percent of children attend school; 
84 percent of children are employed; and of those 
employed, 47 percent are employed under the survey\'s 
definition of child labor.  Also included in the report 
are Street Children and Child Prostitution studies, 
which focus on the socio-economic factors involved in 
the children\'s situation.  Without quantifying the 
number of street children or child prostitutes, both 
surveys found that a majority of street kids and 
children in sex trade had lost one or both parents. END 
SUMMARY 
 
Child Population of Malawi 
-------------------------- 
2. The Malawi Child Labor Survey (MCLS) was carried out 
through a representative sample of 8,000 households. 
From these interviews, it was determined that there are 
approximately 3.8 million children in Malawi between the 
ages five and seventeen and that these children account 
for 34 percent of Malawi\'s total population.  Although 
2.7 million children (72 percent) reported being 
enrolled in school, the survey estimated that 3.2 
million children (84 percent) were working either in 
their homes or outside of their homes in both economic 
and non-economic activities during the twelve months 
preceding the survey. 
 
Child Labor 
----------- 
3. The MCLS defines child labour as: \"Working children 
below the age of 14 years who worked for more than seven 
hours in the reference week and working children between 
the ages of five and seventeen, were categorized as 
child labour if they were working in agriculture.\" 
Using this definition, the survey found that around 1.4 
million children in Malawi are employed in child labor, 
representing 37 percent of the total five to seventeen 
child population. 
 
Children in Economic and Non-Economic Activities 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
4. Out of the 3.2 million working children, the survey 
found 1.5 million to be working in economic activities. 
The MCLS defines economic activity as working for pay, 
either in-cash or in-kind, or engagement in family 
activities without pay, such as farming or hunting.  An 
additional 1.7 million children (53 percent of working 
children) were working in only housekeeping capacities. 
The MCLS defines non-economic activity as activities of 
a domestic nature and also voluntary and charitable 
activities. 
 
Street Kids Survey 
------------------ 
5. The Street Kids Survey was conducted in 2003 and used 
a sample population of 396 street children. Of the 
street children interviewed, 93 percent were male, and 
51 percent had at least one deceased parent.  The survey 
found that around 56 percent of street children\'s 
mothers were unemployed, but were capable of working. 
Fewer than four percent reported their mothers to be 
employed. 
 
6. The survey also found approximately four percent of 
street children had worked, or been looking for work, in 
the week prior to being surveyed. 
 
Child Prostitutes Survey 
------------------------ 
7. The Children in Commercial Sexual Exploitation Survey 
(CSECS) was conducted in 2003 with a sample of 549 
children involved in sex work.  Of the children 
surveyed, approximately 85 percent were between the ages 
of fifteen and seventeen and approximately 87 percent 
had been in the sex trade for less than two years. 
 
8. 49 percent of the children surveyed had lost both 
parents, and approximately 60 percent had lost a mother. 
Around 24 percent of the children in commercial sex work 
also had a mother who was unemployed, but capable of 
working.  Fewer than nine percent of the children had 
employed mothers. 
 
9. The survey also found that nine percent of children 
in commercial sex work were attending school.  Of the 
children surveyed who were not attending school, 72 
percent had dropped out, while 18 percent had never 
attended school. 
 
Background 
---------- 
10. Child labor in Malawi came to the attention of the 
international community in 2000, when a report on 
Tobacco Tenants in Malawi acknowledged widespread child 
labor practices.  The MCLS was conducted to provide 
quantitative data on children\'s activities (economic and 
non-economic) to determine the nature, magnitude, and 
reasons for child labor and the subsequent effect of 
such labor on a child\'s education, health, and moral 
development.  USDOL provided financial support for this 
survey through the ILO. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
11. While there are deficiencies with the statistical 
analysis of this report, it does provide a more 
quantitative look at the issue.  Recognizing the 
continuing problem of child labor in various sectors, 
post welcomes Malawi\'s inclusion in the Department of 
Labor\'s International Child Labor Program Education 
Initiative (reftel).

SUBJECT: NEW MINISTER OF EDUCATION SEEKS USG SUPPORT FOR 
EDUCATION PROGRAMS 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  Newly appointed Minister of Education 
Yusuf Mwawa, formerly the Minister of Health under 
President Muluzi, said his first major task is to find a 
solution to the dwindling number of teachers in primary 
schools.  In his estimation, improving the teacher 
training colleges will fill the staffing gaps and 
increase the general quality.  Mwawa also told the 
Charge teacher inspections, retention, and HIV/AIDS 
education are areas where the USG could work with the 
GOM to improve education.  END SUMMARY. 
 
IMPROVING TEACHER COLLEGES 
-------------------------- 
2. During a July 15 introductory call with the Charge, 
newly appointed Minister of Education Yusuf Mwawa, who 
had been Minister of Health in the previous Muluzi 
administration, said the most critical educational need 
in Malawi is primary school teachers.  Outlining his 
initial objectives for the Ministry, Mwawa stated he 
planned to build a cadre of qualified primary school 
teachers by improving the quality of teacher training 
colleges.  Mwawa conceded that standards at training 
colleges had lapsed and suggested that the USG could 
assist by bettering the quality of existing training 
colleges. 
 
TEACHER RETENTION, INSPECTIONS 
------------------------------ 
3. Turning to other areas of concern, Mwawa noted that 
teacher inspections are infrequent and retention rates 
are low.  According to Mwawa, teacher inspections, which 
are supposed to occur three times a year, rarely take 
place.  Mwawa stated that any gains made in teacher 
training would be lost if not followed up by proper 
inspections.  Commenting on the poor retention rate, 
Mwawa said the only way to entice teachers to continuing 
working is to improve teacher salaries and benefit 
packages. 
 
USAID-VA TECH PROGRAM 
--------------------- 
4. Recently returned from the graduation ceremony of 24 
Master Degree students who participated in an in-country 
USAID-Virginia Tech primary education project under the 
University Partners in Institutional Capacity Program, 
Mwawa commented that the program provided excellent 
training for Malawian students and was cost effective. 
He suggested many more in-country programs of this type 
be supported. 
 
INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE 
------------------------------------ 
5. Indicating President Mutharika has a strong interest 
in education, Mwawa said the President directed that a 
full assessment of the current system of education be 
done in the coming six months.  Mwawa hoped that 
important partners like USAID would participate in the 
assessment, which would take the form of a conference in 
November. 
 
HIV/AIDS AND EDUCATION 
---------------------- 
6. A notable issue from his time as Minister of Health, 
Mwawa told the Charge that he would be remiss if he did 
not mention the problems that HIV/AIDS cause in the 
education sector.  Mwawa said many teachers are dying of 
HIV/AIDS.  Mwawa also felt that many Malawian families 
are failing their children by sending them to secondary 
schools without proper education on HIV/AIDS, and this 
lack of education is causing the further spread of the 
disease.  Mwawa planned to make sure HIV/AIDS was taken 
into account when forming new polices and programs for 
the education sector. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. Mwawa rightly assesses that the quality of education 
will improve only with more and better-trained teachers. 
However, given the GOM\'s current resource constraints, 
the education system is not likely to see any new major 
influx of support.  Mwawa\'s challenge will therefore be 
to prioritize which sectors to address first.

SUBJECT: EMBOFFS PRESENT G/TIP REPORT TO NEW GOM MINISTER 
 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY. Charge and Poloff paid an introductory call 
ON Malawi\'s newly appointed Minister of Gender, Child 
Welfare, and Community Services, Joyce Banda.  The minister 
was unfamiliar with the issue of human trafficking and 
Malawi\'s G/TIP Tier Two - Watch List status, and agreed the 
issue should be addressed.  Her staff, however, did not 
believe new legislation to criminalize human trafficking is 
necessary.  She also discussed her views on gender issues, 
her experience in the United States, and her background. 
Biographic notes begin in paragraph 4.  END SUMMARY. 
 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
----------------- 
 
2.  (U) Charge and poloff presented trafficking in persons 
information to Joyce Banda, Malawi\'s Minister of Gender, 
Child Welfare, and Community Services in a July 14 
introductory call.  The issue of Human Trafficking was 
obviously deeply disturbing to Banda, whose first reply was 
\"thank you for ruining my day.\"  Banda said she was \"very 
concerned\" about the fact that it is perceived to be a 
problem in Malawi, and noted that it is a \"complicated 
subject requiring careful study.\"  She believes that though 
U.S. law assumes that all underage prostitutes are 
trafficking victims, the interpretation is not accurate in 
Malawi where 15% of children live in households headed by 
another child and HIV/AIDS is a major crisis, causing 
orphaned teenagers to turn to prostitution for economic 
survival.  Banda noted, however, that there are other ways 
for young girls to make money, and lamented the fact that 
educational and economic resources to encourage such options 
are extremely limited.  Economic empowerment, she said, is 
the key to social and political empowerment, all of which 
would reduce the likelihood of a girl becoming a trafficking 
victim. 
 
3.  (U) Banda was eager to learn more about human trafficking 
and indicated she would attend a USG hosted human trafficking 
symposium scheduled in late July.  She noted that the GOM\'s 
resources are severely constrained and expressed hope that 
the USG would partner with the GOM to combat the problem. 
 
4.  (U)  Banda\'s Principal Secretary (PS) was reluctant to 
agree that Malawian law should specifically criminalize human 
trafficking, making the argument that the current penal code 
is strong enough to convict traffickers.  The PS also took 
the position that prostitution is often a means of survival - 
albeit a last resort - for unskilled and uneducated women. 
 
A PERSONAL DEBT TO THE USG 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Banda indicated she felt a great personal debt to 
the USG.  She participated in an International Visitor 
Program in 1989, and while in the U.S. had direct contact 
with American women\'s organizations and presented academic 
papers in Washington D.C.  She used her experience in the 
U.S. as a model for the organizations she has since started 
in Malawi.  In 1990 she established the National Association 
of Business Women, which has assisted over 27,000 women and 
disbursed USD 2 million in loans.  In 1997 she founded the 
Joyce Banda Foundation for Better Girls\' Education, which, 
according to Banda, sponsors over 630 students and provides 
care and housing for over 550 orphans.  In October of 1997 
she was awarded the African Leadership Prize for the 
Sustainable End to Hunger. In 1998 she negotiated the 
establishment of The Hunger Project in Malawi.  In 2000 she 
founded the Young Emerging Leaders Network, which aims to 
increase young business people in networking. 
 
BIODATA, CONTINUED 
------------------ 
 
5.  (SBU) Banda is the wife of former Chief Justice Richard 
Banda, who is her second husband.  She said her first 
marriage was abusive and that she left with three small 
children and started her own business.   According to Banda, 
the previous dictatorial regime in Malawi did not like her 
actions to organize and assist women, and fearing persecution 
she once \"hid out\" at what was then the USIS building. 
 
6.  (U) Banda has a BA in early childhood education and has 
worked as a secretary and ran a bakery.  Her limited 
political experience includes a year as the treasurer of a 
rural village committee and three years (2000-2003) as the 
District Secretary of the Woman\'s Wing of the Zomba Urban 
Constituency.  In 2003 she became the National Director of 
Women\'s Affairs, and was elected to Parliament in May 2004. 
In 1995, she delivered a speech at the International 
Conference on Women in Beijing, and has spoken at numerous 
other conferences around the world.  She has twice been voted 
Malawi\'s Woman of the Year (1997 and 1998.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6.  (SBU) Banda said in the meeting that women and children 
are her passion, and her career underlines her commitment. 
Her significant accomplishments to boost the status of women 
in one of the world\'s poorest countries are remarkable. 
Banda also noted that she \"didn\'t get here (to her position 
as minister) by accident\" and from what we can see she has 
indeed worked her way up.  When presented with the issue of 
human trafficking, Banda seemed eager to engage other GOM 
officials on the issue but was not confident that GOM funds 
will be available to assist.  The views expressed by her PS 
lead us to believe he will not be an advocate for 
strengthening Malawi\'s existing criminal statute with regard 
to human trafficking.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) Mere days after former President Muluzi left on his 
annual (government-funded) ex-presidential vacation, 
President Bingu wa Mutharika replaced several key government 
officials.  He appointed a new Commander of the Army 
(reftel), a new Director of Public Prosecutions, and a new 
Chief of Staff.  In addition, he divided the Secretary to the 
Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) into two separate 
positions: a secretary to OPC and a head of the civil 
service.  Appointing professionals and personal loyalists, 
Mutharika demonstrated a sudden display of independence from 
the former President, albeit in Muluzi\'s absence from the 
country, that has come much to the consternation of the 
United Democratic Front\'s (UDF) old guard.  With the ruling 
UDF\'s working majority in Parliament a result of Muluzi\'s 
dealings, Mutharika is gambling on the notion that people 
want reform so badly that opposition parties will support his 
initiatives.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NEWLY FOUND INDEPENDENCE? 
------------------------- 
2. (C) Within days after former President Muluzi departed on 
his annual (government-funded) ex-presidential vacation, 
President Bingu wa Mutharika replaced key government 
officials loyal to Muluzi and the ruling United Democratic 
Front (UDF) with professionals and Mutharika loyalists. 
Muluzi is expected to return to Malawi in mid-August. 
 
DPP TO PROSECUTE FOR CORRUPTION 
------------------------------- 
3. (C) The largely ineffectual (and often counterproductive) 
Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Fahad Assani was 
controversially replaced with Ishmael Wadi, an unknown, 
seemingly idealistic lawyer with little experience.  In a 
July 28 meeting with poloff, Wadi forthrightly outlined 
several corruption cases involving former and current 
ministers (including the Vice President) and declared his 
intention to take their cases to court.  Clearly versed in 
the outstanding cases in his office and the authorities of 
his position, Wadi said he planned to maintain the 
independence of the DPP and indiscriminately try cases based 
on the facts. 
 
4. (C) Talking about the political pressure on his position, 
Wadi said he would rather resign than compromise on a case 
and that he plans to use the media to expose anyone trying to 
pressure him.  Wadi also said he has already assigned three 
new public prosecutors to the Anti-Corruption Bureau, which 
had lost all of its lawyers to political pressure and salary 
payment problems. (NOTE: Wadi has not yet been confirmed by 
the parliamentary committee on Public Appointments.  The 
committee, which was formed on July 27, plans to consider the 
Wadi appointment the week of August 2.  The Malawi Congress 
Party (MCP), the principal opposition party in Parliament, 
has already publicly declared its support for Wadi. END NOTE.) 
 
CHIEF OF STAFF COMMENTS ON FORMER ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
5. (C) On June 30, Mutharika appointed Ken Ng\'oma as Chief of 
Staff.  Ng\'oma, who was Secretary General of Mutharika\'s 
pre-UDF political party, has made strong and public 
statements about \"gross mismanagement\" in the Muluzi 
administration.  In a July 28 meeting with poloff, Ng\'oma 
said that weeding out corruption is one of his major 
priorities and that he plans to deal with perpetrators 
regardless of their status in the party.  Ng\'oma dismissed 
the idea that Mutharika\'s newly found independence would 
subside with Muluzi\'s return.  He intimated that Mutharika 
will be making further \"big changes\" and that we should 
\"expect fireworks\" upon Muluzi\'s return.  Discussing the 
growing displeasure of the UDF\'s old guard, Ng\'oma simply 
commented that they were wrong to think that they could 
control Mutharika because Mutharika is \"a man of principle.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (C) Mutharika\'s show of independence began when Muluzi 
left the country, and the strong reform statements of his 
prima facie free-thinking appointees have yet to be 
translated into action.  Without such action, Mutharika has a 
long way to go to establish himself as the reform President 
he advertises himself to be. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED. However, if the Mutharika 
administration does try to implement its proposed reforms, it 
may find itself without the necessary political support, 
having isolated many UDF parliamentarians and heavy-weights. 
The gamble that Mutharika makes is that opposition and civil 
society groups will politically support him if he brings 
about genuine change and that he does not truly need the 
support of his own party.  END COMMENT.

REF: A. LILONGWE 710 
 
     B. LILONGWE 714 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) Minister of Foreign Affairs George Chaponda told the 
Charge on July 28 that the GOM is \"very concerned\" about 
Malawi\'s ranking as a Tier Two - Watch List country in the 
Department\'s 2004 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report. 
Chaponda said the ranking \"did not reflect the situation on 
the ground\" and was \"contestable and debatable.\"  Further 
explaining the government\'s position, Chaponda said the 
report\'s findings were \"not substantiated by qualified 
evidence,\" and he insinuated that the misinformation may have 
been the result of a report by an NGO who \"had not done 
thorough research on the matter.\"  In addition to detailing 
measures the GOM has already taken and will take against TIP, 
Chaponda commented that an inter-minsterial meeting on the 
issue concluded that the GOM will release a press statement 
contesting the Department\'s ranking, which it did later in 
the day.  Although challenging the accuracy of the report, 
Chaponda repeatedly declared the GOM\'s commitment to fighting 
TIP and support for USG TIP initiatives at UNGA.  Text of 
press statement begins in paragraph 11.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CHAPONDA READY TO TALK ON TIP 
----------------------------- 
2. (SBU) At a July 28 meeting with the Charge, Minister of 
Foreign Affairs George Chaponda used the USG\'s initiative on 
TIP at UNGA as an entree to officially respond on behalf of 
the GOM to Malawi\'s Tier Two - Watch List ranking in the 
Department\'s 2004 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.  Well 
briefed and reading from a prepared statement, Chaponda said 
the GOM \"was very concerned\" about Malawi\'s ranking because 
\"it did not reflect the situation on the ground.\"  Chaponda 
described the report as \"contestable and debatable\" and 
asserted that its findings were not \"substantiated by 
qualified evidence.\"  Chaponda indicated that the report had 
been discussed at an inter-ministerial meeting, where 
representatives from various branches of government found the 
ranking \"shocking.\"  (NOTE: The Charge later learned that the 
President, having read the 2004 TIP report, ordered the 
inter-ministerial meeting to convene. END NOTE.) 
 
THE GOM\'S SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS 
----------------------------- 
3. (SBU) Pointing out specific areas of concern, Chaponda 
questioned the Department\'s interpretation of \"TIP\" and of 
\"prostitution,\" suggesting that the two were separate issues 
and that the report\'s characterization of them were \"an 
exaggeration of reality.\"  Chaponda argued that the GOM had 
been \"uncompromising\" in its dealing with the \"few reported 
cases\" of TIP.  Without citing specific examples, Chaponda 
said that the few cases that had been reported were 
investigated and taken to court, resulting in a number of 
convictions.  Chaponda also said there had been a number of 
\"unconfirmed and unsubstantiated claims\" that lacked enough 
evidence for the police to follow up on.  As evidence of the 
police\'s work, Chaponda said that several cases had even been 
referred to Interpol.  Rounding out his argument about the 
GOM\'s effective treatment of TIP, Chaponda asserted that the 
Police and other government experts had not been adequately 
consulted during the compilation of the report.  (NOTE: 
Con/poloff later confirmed to Charge that the police, indeed, 
had been consulted.  END NOTE.) 
 
MALAWI\'S LAWS AS RELATED TO TIP 
------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Turning to Malawi\'s legal framework as related to 
TIP, Chaponda said the Penal Code has several provisions 
prohibiting \"offenses against morality, such as prostitution 
and the movement of people.\"  To make the legislation more 
forceful, he said Parliament will pass in the coming sessions 
legislation that specifically criminalizes TIP.  Chaponda 
said the bill had been presented last year and that 
parliamentarians wanted \"more time to study the issue\" before 
acting on the legislation.  He assured the Charge, that \"as a 
parliamentarian,\" he \"will make sure the legislation goes 
through.\" 
 
5. (SBU) Reinforcing his assertion that the GOM was serious 
about TIP, Chaponda specifically cited Malawi\'s accession to 
the \"Convention for the Suppression of the TIP and of the 
Exploitation of Prostitution of Others\" (New York, 1950) and 
the \"Final Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of 
the TIP and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of 
Others\" (New York, 1950).  Chaponda also said the GOM has 
finished consultations and intends to sign and ratify the 
\"Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish TIP Especially 
Women and Child, Supplementing the United Nations Convention 
Against Transnational Organized Crimes\" (2000), AKA \"The 
Palermo Protocol.\" 
 
MISINFORMATION AND A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE 
----------------------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Offering a possible source of misinformation, 
Chaponda said the report recently released by International 
Organization on Migration (IOM) was not based on \"a thorough 
research of TIP\" in Malawi.  He questioned the veracity of 
information that a non-resident organization could produce 
and also noted how dated the report\'s example cases were. 
 
7. (SBU) Turning to a regional perspective, Chaponda said he, 
as a lawyer, had examined the laws in other SADC nations and 
found Malawi\'s TIP laws to be comparable to those of other 
countries.  He specifically noted Botswana\'s TIP laws were 
very similar to those of Malawi. 
 
FURTHER INVESTIGATION NECESSARY AND THE GOM\'S RESPONSE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
8. (SBU) Before moving to Malawi\'s position at UNGA, Chaponda 
\"begged\" for wider consultation to be done on TIP in Malawi 
and indicated that the GOM had decided to issue a press 
statement to refute the Department\'s claims in the 2004 TIP 
Report. 
 
SUPPORT AT UNGA 
--------------- 
9. (SBU) Chaponda concluded by saying that Malawi, as a 
nation \"committed to fighting TIP,\" will support the USG\'s 
TIP initiatives at UNGA, even though the GOM challenges the 
findings of the Department\'s report (reftel B). 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
10. (SBU) Chaponda rightly notes that much of what is known 
about TIP in Malawi is based on rumors and hearsay.  In 
addition, the GOM\'s press statement accurately details the 
government\'s previous efforts to prevent TIP, prosecute 
perpetrators, and protect victims.  Considering the lack of 
specific evidence on the issue and the GOM\'s budgetary focus 
on pro-poor expenditures, it is unlikely that the GOM will 
have any additional resources to spend on TIP.  Without 
concrete evidence and resources forthcoming, it will become 
more difficult to continuing justifying the Department\'s 
stance on TIP in Malawi.  That said, we are encouraged by the 
GOM\'s renewed interested to improve TIP legislation and to 
ratify the Palermo Protocol.  END COMMENT. 
 
11. (U) The press statement issued by the GOM is as follows: 
 
PRESS STATEMENT ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND PROSTITUTION 
 
The Government of the Republic of Malawi has noted with 
concern the report issued by the United States Department of 
State giving the impression that the human trafficking 
situation in Malawi, particularly of women and children, and 
organized prostitution, has escalated to the extent of 
warranting Malawi to be listed as a Tier 2 Watch List country. 
 
The Government of Malawi finds the report debatable, 
particularly considering that it is not substantiated by a 
list of identifiable interviewees, credible sources or 
confirmed incidences and reliable statistics.  The facts on 
the ground show that the Government of the Republic of Malawi 
has been uncompromising in dealing with the only few reported 
and known cases of trafficking in human beings and organized 
prostitution, thereby drawing the wrath of human rights 
activists and women and children rights groups. 
 
Indeed, the few reported and confirmed cases have been 
vigorously pursued in the courts and in a number of instances 
perpetrators have been convicted.  It is, therefore, 
disturbing when other agencies claim that Malawi has no laws 
making human trafficking and organized prostitution criminal 
offenses.  If a number of perpetrators have been arrested and 
convicted for trafficking women and children, one wonders 
what laws they may have violated for argument sake. 
 
There have been many claims, most of which unconfirmed or 
unsubstantiated, making it almost impossible for the Malawi 
Police to arrest or prosecute anybody.  No doubt, quite a 
number of agencies both within and outside the Government 
could not provide credible information to the Police or the 
Ministry responsible for women and children affairs, to 
support the claims in the report.  The Malawi Police Force on 
its own initiative has contacted a number of international 
enforcement agencies, such as, Interpol and SARPCO, who also 
could not confirm the findings in the report.  There may have 
been some isolated incidences but certainly not to the extent 
of the picture painted by the report. 
 
The people who compiled this report seem not to have 
consulted any experts on this subject or the people who could 
have availed them with accurate information.  Our observation 
is that they may have misdirected themselves on the law 
governing trafficking and prostitution.  We also question 
their interpretation of the technical terms \"trafficking in 
human beings\" and \"prostitution.\"  If the report is talking 
about prostitution and trafficking in international law and 
under common law jurisdictions, then the findings of the 
report are an exaggeration of the realities on the ground. 
 
The Government of the Republic of Malawi wishes to reiterate 
its commitment to fight and stamp out trafficking in humans, 
particularly in women and children and will spare no effort 
in this endeavor.  Indeed, Malawi has already signed and 
ratified a number of critical conventions and protocols aimed 
at addressing this human trafficking and prostitution 
including: the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic 
in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of 
Others, adopted in New York in March 1950 and the Final 
Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic 
in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of 
Others also adopted in New York in the same year.  It has 
also concluded consultations on the \"Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women 
and Children, supplementing the Untied Nations Convention 
Against Organized Transnational Organized Crimes, 2000\" with 
the aim of signing and ratifying. 
 
It is curious to note that despite having legal provisions in 
our laws i.e., the Constitution and the Penal Code which has 
an exclusive chapter entitled \"Offenses Against Morality\" 
dealing with \"prostitution,  living on earnings of 
prostitution, taking people away either within or outside 
Malawi for prostitution, taking people away to be in brothels 
whether willingly or against their consent\" among other 
offenses provided for, the report in question paints a very 
bad picture of Malawi. 
 
Further, the Government, on its own initiative, after 
carrying out consultations on the possible legal 
complications and technical problems of prosecuting certain 
permutations of offenses related to human trafficking 
especially among women and children and taking into 
contemplation obligations assumed by being parties to 
treaties, and in solidarity with global efforts to curb the 
problem in this area, prepared and submitted to Parliament, 
the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill No: 12.  The Bill has never 
been withdrawn but that Members of Parliament asked for more 
time to study and appreciate certain concepts about 
trafficking and prostitution, most of which, novel and 
inconsistent with traditional notions of prostitution and 
cultural values as understood.  It is, therefore, a 
misrepresentation to suggest that the Bill was withdrawn or 
that our Penal Code is so inadequate to an extent that 
traffickers in human beings would easily slip through the 
long arm of the law, warranting the conclusion in the report 
that Malawi has no laws to curb offenses of trafficking and 
prostitution.  Our contention is that the low levels of 
arrests and prosecutions only vindicate the realities of the 
problem as it exists on the ground and as confirmed by our 
own experts. 
 
The Government of Malawi is willing and ready to work with 
any agency which has credible information that could help, if 
any, in cracking down on any known or identifiable gangs or 
groups or persons in trafficking or prostitution.  Further it 
also welcomes experts, if any, who have information on the 
purported inadequacies of its laws other than the way our 
Penal Code (Amendment) Bill No: 12 proposes to seal perceived 
technicalities and nuances. 
 
The Government of the Republic of Malawi vehemently and 
categorically rejects the findings in the report painting a 
picture that human trafficking and organized prostitution 
have escalated and that it has no legal mechanism to address 
the few and isolated confirmed cases.

GAINING IDENTITY

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) With former President and United Democratic Front 
(UDF) Chairman Bakili Muluzi\'s return from his overseas 
holiday and President Bingu wa Mutharika\'s continuing display 
of independence (reftel), a fissure in the ruling UDF is 
quickly forming between Muluzi\'s old guard and Mutharika\'s 
recent converts.  A UDF heavyweight\'s arrest and the 
President\'s overly frank new Chief of Staff have left party 
members drawing lines and choosing sides.  Judging from 
Muluzi\'s trenchant comments upon his August 1 arrival, the 
UDF did not anticipate Mutharika would bring with him changes 
to the party or its mode of operation.  All the while, 
government is slowly developing an identity independent of 
the ruling party, a completely novel distinction in Malawi. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
UDF HEAVYWEIGHT ARRESTED FOR ALLEGED CORRUPTION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
2. (C) Just before President Muluzi\'s return to Malawi from a 
three-week overseas holiday, the Fiscal Police, a specialized 
branch of the Malawi Police Service, arrested Muluzi loyalist 
and United Democratic Front (UDF) heavyweight Humphrey Mvula 
on July 30 for alleged fraud and corruption.  Mvula, 
well-known for financing other members of Muluzi\'s inner UDF 
circle and for leading the party\'s militant youth wing, was 
reportedly organizing and financing Muluzi\'s August 1 
welcome-home reception designed to \"up stage\" President 
Mutharika.  UDF Secretary General and Muluzi stalwart Kennedy 
Makwangwala termed Mvula\'s arrest a \"political witch-hunt\" 
and condemned government\'s investigation into Shire Bus 
Lines, the parastatal where Mvula is CEO.  Mvula has since 
been released on bail, amid rumors that Muluzi loyalists in 
the UDF have formed a taskforce to discredit the Mutharika 
government. 
 
CHOOSING SIDES 
-------------- 
3. (SBU) Two Mutharika supporters in the UDF, calling 
themselves \"concerned citizens,\" released a press statement 
on July 27 castigating the \"UDF big wigs\" for not supporting 
Mutharika.  The statement also called the rumored formation 
of a UDF taskforce against Mutharika \"shocking and 
disappointing.\"  In response, Makwangwala issued a press 
release on July 31, calling for a stop to the \"outrageous\" 
allegations of corruption and to the \"unfair\" remarks about 
Muluzi.  The statement concluded by denying that UDF gurus 
were against the President or that an anti-Mutharika 
taskforce had been formed. 
 
HEADS BUTT: NG\'OMA VS. MAKWANGWALA 
---------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Tensions between Makwangwala and newly-appointed 
Chief of Staff Ken Ng\'oma formalized when Ng\'oma reportedly 
filed legal proceedings against Makwangwala for defamation. 
Ng\'oma, who quickly became popular with civil society and 
opposition political parties for publicly denouncing the 
Muluzi administration\'s \"gross mismanagement\" of public 
funds, has angered many senior UDF officials with his 
frankness.  Makwangala, defending the UDF and Muluzi, 
publicly called for Ng\'oma\'s silence on July 30, following a 
UDF National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting where it was 
decided Ng\'oma needed to stop \"cleaning the party\'s dirty 
linen in public.\" 
 
MULUZI WARNS UPON HIS RETURN 
---------------------------- 
5. (SBU) At an August 1 rally immediately upon his return to 
Malawi, Muluzi directed comments to a notably absent 
Mutharika, saying \"there cannot be a government led by an 
independent President.\"  Continuing his admonishment, Muluzi 
said such a President would not have the support of 
Parliament, and \"there is no way to run government with a 
disgruntled Parliament.\"  Muluzi also declared, \"Anyone who 
does not have a heart for the UDF should pack their luggage 
and go.\"  In his brief address, Muluzi said he will take a 
three-week national trip to \"revitalize the UDF,\" where, he 
said, he will continue his signature cash handouts, which 
many UDF supporters have criticized Mutharika for ceasing. 
UDF Regional Governor for the South John Chikakwiya commented 
to journalists that it was \"a relief to the party faithful\" 
to have Muluzi back in the country.  Throughout the address, 
Muluzi was flanked by Vice President Cassim Chilumpha, UDF 
heavyweights, and members of other parties that form the 
UDF\'s working majority in Parliament, a coalition that Muluzi 
engineered. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (C) Muluzi clearly thought Mutharika would have to yield 
to him because Mutharika needed the Muluzi-orchestrated 
working majority in Parliament to run government.  However, 
Mutharika seems confident that genuine reform will win him 
enough political support in the House to implement his 
agenda.  With fear of corruption convictions spreading 
through the UDF old guard, the ruling party\'s fracture will 
continue to grow.  Meanwhile, the leadership struggle in the 
UDF, though chaotic for the party, is creating a noticeable 
separation between government and the ruling party, a 
distinction that did not exist during Dr. Banda\'s regime or 
Muluzi\'s two terms in office.

SUBJECT: TIP OPEN FOR DISCUSSION IN MALAWI 
 
REF: A. LILONGWE 723 
 
     B. LILONGWE 710 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  On July 29, post hosted a Human Rights 
Symposium focused on trafficking in persons (TIP).  In 
attendance were numerous GOM officials, including Minister of 
Gender, Child Welfare, and Community Services Joyce Banda. 
The keynote address was presented by Supreme Court Justice 
Anastazia Msosa, and focused on what actions the GOM and 
civil society organizations might take to address the issue 
in Malawi.  Also in attendance were media representatives, 
NGO leaders, and diplomats, all of whom contributed to a 
thoughtful, intelligent discussion of how the problem of 
human trafficking can best be addressed in Malawi.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  In her keynote address Supreme Court Justice Anastazia 
Msosa pointed out that widespread poverty and rampant 
HIV/AIDS infection are likely behind Malawi\'s nascent TIP 
problem.  Regardless of these reasons, she said, human 
trafficking cannot be tolerated and must be addressed.  She 
called for tougher laws which would \"close the gaps\" in the 
existing penal code and a careful study of the exact nature 
of the problem in Malawi, both of which would permit the GOM 
to \"lead the fight\" against TIP.  Msosa, a well-respected, 
vocal human rights advocate, spoke openly about the need to 
develop and implement a national, regional, and global 
network to \"speak with one voice\" against human trafficking. 
 
3.  Minister Banda opted not to make a formal presentation 
(NOTE: Likely because of the GOM\'s refutation of the TIP 
report, reftel A.)  Banda did, however, add pertinent 
comments to the general discussion and was eager to hear from 
human rights NGOs and USG officials.  \"You have an ally in 
me,\" she said when asked for a reaction to the discussion. 
 
4.  None of the GOM or NGO representatives present expressed 
surprise that TIP occurred in Malawi, and most seemed more 
interested in the way forward than in the mechanics of the 
report or of U.S. policy.  One senior GOM official who works 
in a ministry which has been particularly vocal in rejecting 
the TIP report\'s findings admitted that as traffickers become 
more \"sophisticated,\" Malawi\'s laws need to keep pace and 
become equally sophisticated. 
 
5.  On August 2, an article in a nationwide daily newspaper 
correctly quoted the TIP report and referenced Msosa\'s July 
29 remarks.  The leader of a well-known NGO umbrella 
organization is quoted as saying that while the GOM lacks the 
capacity to investigate TIP, it can do more to address the 
problem. 
 
6.  COMMENT.  The issue of TIP is officially open for 
discussion in Malawi, a good start in raising awareness and 
encouraging action.  The attendance of several key GOM 
officials at the symposium and the GOM\'s scathing, but 
inconsistent, rebuttal to the TIP report both indicate that 
the issue has caught the GOM\'s attention.  As in our initial 
meeting regarding TIP (reftel B), the Minister was not 
interested in debating the USG\'s report, but rather gave us 
assurances of her interest in preventing TIP from increasing 
in Malawi.  The GOM\'s capacity and resources to investigate 
and prevent TIP are extremely limited; partnerships with NGOs 
and churches are likely to yield the best results in the 
fight against TIP. The recent publicity and, in the case of 
the GOM, unease regarding TIP may well serve as a catalyst 
for action.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) After several last-minutes delays and missed 
deadlines, the Government of Malawi has signed a direct 
agreement with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation 
(OPIC) and the Central East African Railways Company (CEAR) 
to revive the Nacala Port and Rail Corridor.  CEAR\'s holding 
company broke the impasse by agreeing in principle to let a 
potential Malawian investor buy into the company, despite 
rumors of financial connections with the former president. 
The way is now clear for OPIC to reinstate a loan offer that 
was allowed to lapse in May.  If the project comes to 
fruition, it stands to cut the transport cost of Malawian 
imports and exports significantly.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------ 
STUCK ON OWNERSHIP 
------------------ 
 
2. (U) On July 29, Finance Minister Goodall Gondwe signed the 
OPIC direct agreement that had been the latest stumbling 
block for the Nacala Port and Rail Corridor.  The project 
will refurbish the rail link between Malawi and the 
Mozambican deepwater port of Nacala, as well as the port 
itself.  Despite assurances from both the previous and the 
current government that Malawi was eager to close the deal, 
the GOM had refused since March to sign the OPIC agreement 
unless the project\'s holding company held open an ownership 
stake for a potential Malawian investor. 
 
3. (U) The holding company, Nacala Corridor Development 
Company (SDCN, the Mozambican abbreviation), recently agreed 
with the GOM on a process by which Malawian investors could 
come forward with an offer within the next six months. 
Agreement on the ownership question instantly opened the way 
for the GOM to sign the $30 million OPIC loan agreement.  For 
the agreement to take effect, however, OPIC must reinstate a 
loan offer that lapsed in May because of the ownership 
disagreement. 
 
 
-------------------- 
RUMORS OF CORRUPTION 
-------------------- 
 
4. (C) The GOM\'s demands on behalf of a private investor have 
fueled the rumor that former president (and current ruling 
party chair) Bakili Muluzi has a personal stake in a 
potential investor, Farmers World.  The American shareholders 
in SDCN, Edlow Resources Limited (PROTECT), have told us they 
are convinced Farmers World must have some extraordinary 
financial connection with Malawian political leadership to 
have induced the GOM to hold up the OPIC deal.  Sources in 
the commercial sector here have echoed this conviction, and 
the presence of Farmers World representatives at GOM meetings 
on Nacala suggests that it has some basis in fact.  Muluzi is 
known to be deeply invested in Malawian trucking, so an 
interest in a transport project that could someday dominate 
bulk import and export shipping is plausible, though 
unsubstantiated. 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
COMMENT: CLEAR ECONOMIC BENEFITS 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) A modern, reliable Nacala Port and Rail Corridor could 
have a sizable effect on the Malawian economy.  The country 
relies heavily on imported fertilizers for its agricultural 
base and on tobacco and other agricultural exports for 
foreign currency.  The cost and unpredictability of moving 
goods via mixed truck and rail from seaports in South Africa, 
Tanzania, and Mozambique constitute major constraints on the 
efficiency of Malawi\'s agriculture and the competitiveness of 
its exports.  With the current GOM finally focusing on 
agricultural trade as a way out of poverty, the time seems 
ripe for attacking these constraints.  The Nacala Corridor 
would go a long way towards accomplishing that, if only by 
connecting Malawi with the closest port.  An additional 
extension of the rail line to the Zambian border at Chipata 
could make Malawi into a modest transportation hub for 
south-central Africa.

SUBJECT: SITREP 29: DISASTER ALERT FOR EMERGING HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE NEEDS IN MALAWI 
 
1. Summary: Many of the same conditions that sparked the 
2001-2003 food crisis are emerging again this year in 
Malawi. The recently concluded harvest was slightly below 
the ten year average and below the 2001 harvest volume 
that presaged the 2001-2003 food crisis. Government maize 
stocks, which last year were at record highs, are 
depleted. Humanitarian stocks are also low with few 
donors having made formal food aid pledges to World Food 
Program (WFP) emergency operations in Malawi. 
Furthermore, uncertainty about Government maize imports 
may create disincentives for private sector imports. A 
lack of leadership in the Ministry of Agriculture has 
resulted in Government inaction and conflicting messages 
regarding the likely Government response. Lastly, a 
devaluation of the Malawian kwacha seems possible. Such 
devaluation would raise the Malawian kwacha price of 
imported maize for those households dependent on market 
purchases. Post request is contained in paragraph 14. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
FINAL RESULTS FROM FOOD PRODUCTION SURVEYS 
------------------------------------------ 
2. Several districts in Malawi received below average 
rainfall and experienced periodic dry spells during the 
2003/04 cropping season, resulting in a decline in 
agricultural production. According to recent assessments, 
districts in the Southern Region of the country were the 
most affected. Severely affected districts (40-50 percent 
decline in production relative to last year) are Machinga 
(eastern part), Phalombe, Chikwawa and Nsanje. Other 
affected districts (30-35 percent decline) include 
Chikwawa, Blantyre, Chiradzulu, parts of Thyolo, Mwanza, 
Balaka, parts of Zomba, Mangochi, Salima and Karonga. 
 
3. Final crop estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Irrigation and Food Security (MOAIFS) have put national 
maize production at 1.69 million (metric) tons, 15 
percent below the 1.98 million tons reported last year 
and slightly below the ten year national maize production 
average of 1.73 million tons. Results of a Food and 
Agricultural Organization (FAO) also put the maize 
harvest at 1.7 million tons. Annual consumption 
requirements for maize are thought to be in the 
neighborhood of 2 million tons. Rice production declined 
25 percent from 88,000 tons last year to 66,000 tons this 
year. Cassava production has increased from 1.74 million 
tons to 2.5 million tons due to area expansion. 
 
-------------------------------- 
MALAWI VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE (VAC) RESULTS 
-------------------------------- 
4. The independent, multi-agency Vulnerability Assessment 
Committee (VAC) report was completed late last month. The 
VAC report estimates that between 1.34 million and 1.68 
million people will require humanitarian food assistance 
in Malawi between June 2004 and March 2005. 
 
5. The Malawi VAC report presents two scenarios for 
humanitarian food needs in Malawi, ranging from 56,030 
tons (scenario 1) to 83,550 tons (scenario 2) in the 12 
most affected zones. Scenario 1 assumes that food prices 
will remain relatively constant, while scenario 2 assumes 
that food prices rise 30 percent by end of the year. Post 
believes that the more pessimistic scenario 2 is more 
probable. WFP is gearing up to expand food distribution 
through a well-managed NGO consortium, but the WFP food 
pipeline remains severely constrained. WFP is making a 
strong appeal for donor pledges for Malawi. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
LACK OF PURCHASING POWER AND LIMITED MAIZE STOCKS 
INCREASE FOOD NEEDS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
6. Malawi faces a set of structural problems that mean a 
significant portion of the population are vulnerable to 
increasingly smaller shocks. This is especially true 
during the \"hungry season\" when most households have run 
out of maize and are dependent on the market. Reliable 
maize trade links with Mozambique and Tanzania have 
enhanced food security in Malawi, but only for those with 
significant purchasing power. 
 
7. Households in Malawi\'s Southern Region will need the 
most food aid this year, with needs already emerging in 
some districts (particularly Machinga, Phalombe, Nsanje 
and Chikwawa districts). The majority of relief 
assistance will be required during the hungry season 
beginning in October 2004 until the next harvest in April 
2005. 
 
8. Given the improved methods used by the VAC assessment 
this year, improved geographical targeting of food 
assistance will be possible. For example, with current 
VAC data, it will be possible to target assistance down 
to the Extension Planning Area (EPA) level rather than 
just the district level. Use of sorghum instead of maize 
in food aid programs will also reduce the likelihood of 
disrupting the important cross-border trade between 
Southern Malawi and Northern Mozambique. 
 
9. In the aftermath of the pre-election maize sell-off, 
the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) silos are nearly empty. 
Only some 7,000 MT of maize remains and most of this 
maize is of poor quality and not fit for human 
consumption. The European Union has committed to help 
restock the SGR and is tendering for 28,000 tons. The 
Government of Malawi has promised to replace the 30,000 
tons that were sold from the SGR in breach of agreed-upon 
procedures, but whether the Government will be able to do 
so remains to be seen. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS MAY CREATE DISINCENTIVES FOR 
COMMERCIAL IMPORTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
10. In past years, the bulk of Malawi\'s maize deficit has 
been met through formal and informal private sector 
imports. The year\'s maize deficit is estimated by the FAO 
to be 408,000 tons. Evidence from past years suggests 
that the informal cross-border trade could bring as much 
as 350,000 MT from Mozambique, Zambia and Tanzania this 
season. 
 
11. However, the volume of private sector trade is 
dependent on the right price signals. That is, private 
traders need profit opportunities and information about 
likely Government of Malawi interventions in the maize 
market. In past years, Government importation and sales 
of maize at subsidized prices has discouraged the private 
sector maize trade while doing little to assist the most 
vulnerable populations. 
 
12. Thus, recent reports that the Government of Malawi is 
planning to import 160,000 tons of maize could damage 
private sector incentives, actually reducing the total 
maize available in Malawi. Government officials have been 
tight-lipped about maize import plans. Furthermore, the 
Government of Malawi has not made it clear whether the 
maize sales will be continue at subsidized prices in 
light of the conversion of ADMARC into a limited 
liability company. 
 
13. There is no indication that the Government of Malawi 
is planning to make a disaster declaration in the coming 
days. Yet, Post believes that such silence reflects the 
current lack of leadership within the Ministry of 
Agriculture rather than any firm belief that no 
assistance is needed. 
 
14. Post request:  USAID\'s Food for Peace (FFP) office 
has been working closely with Post to plan for the 
upcoming hungry season. Current FFP plans include 
diverting up to 5000 tons of food to Malawi. FFP 
recognizes that this will be insufficient, but faces 
tight FY 2004 budgets and high demand. As a result, Post 
strongly urges AID/W to consider a total food allocation 
to WFP/Malawi of 30,000 tons during the July 2004 to 
April 2005 period. Sorghum would be more appropriate than 
maize this year in Malawi. While the situation in Malawi 
is not yet at crisis stage, relatively small price shocks 
coupled with unmet humanitarian needs could quickly 
trigger a crisis later this year.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) At last week\'s outbriefing to donor countries, the 
IMF\'s Article IV assessment team said Malawi\'s new government 
is going in the right economic direction and that the IMF 
team would recommend a Staff Monitoring Program for the 
2004/05 fiscal year.  They assessed the GOM\'s draft budget as 
realistic and workable, though tight, and expressed 
confidence that the GOM would succeed in establishing 
budgetary discipline.  The new government is showing signs of 
the political will needed to achieve macroeconomic stability. 
 If the new government succeeds in sticking to its budget 
over the next several months, donors will have to act quickly 
to avoid a balance of payments crisis late in the calendar 
year.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
IMF ENCOURAGED, READY WITH MONITORING PROGRAM 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) At the end of a two-week Article IV assessment, a team 
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) described 
themselves as \"not at the end of a mission, but at the 
beginning of a new relationship.\"  They said that the new 
government is going in the right direction, based on 
 
 - the team\'s review of June results, where targets were 
achieved \"by a wide margin,\" 
 
 - the draft budget for the July-June fiscal year just begun, 
and 
 
 - a review of achieved and proposed structural reforms. 
 
The team characterized the budget as tight but workable, and 
perhaps most importantly, as inclusive of all forseeable 
expenditures.  Team leader John Green said the team saw good 
confidence in the economy, such that if the GOM sticks to its 
budget, economic conditions, particularly interest rates, 
should improve.  Green said his team would recommend a 
12-month Staff Monitoring Program, starting with July 2004, 
with reviews in September and December.  The earliest 
recommendation for a new Poverty Relief and Growth Facility 
(PRGF) would be in December. 
 
3. (U) In addition to the sanguine assessment of financial 
indicators, the team took note of the new government\'s 
behavioral shift from the previous administration.  The GOM 
has recently said no to extra funding requests, moved the 
President and Cabinet to Lilongwe to save travel costs, 
reduced the size of the Cabinet, and resolved to close five 
to seven embassies.  (NOTE: The IMF team also mentioned the 
government\'s refusal to give Parliament a large pay increase, 
but unconfirmed media reports have since said GOM has agreed 
to an even larger pay package.  END NOTE.)  GOM officials 
have also said they are close to announcing a civil service 
wage reform package, designed to raise salaries, especially 
at the bottom of the scale, and reduce the numerous tax-free 
allowances for high-ranking civil servants.  The team noted 
that its financial targets would allow for government grain 
purchases for this hunger season (late 2004 - early 2005) and 
for fertilizer subsidies for the 2004/5 growing season, 
provided the GOM can keep recurring costs within the new 
budget. 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
GONDWE: IT\'S POSSIBLE, BUT NOT EASY 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Responding to the IMF\'s briefing, Finance Minister 
Goodall Gondwe, a retired IMF official, said he welcomes the 
IMF\'s involvement as an opportunity for the GOM to get its 
financial house in order.  He said he would be surprised if 
the needed reforms are not done in six months.  That said, 
Gondwe noted two factors working against GOM\'s fiscal reform: 
a possible food shortage late this year, and a need to build 
grain stocks in advance of a crisis, and a continuing need 
for fertilizer subsidies for the 65 percent of the population 
below the poverty line.  He added to this an urgent need for 
civil service wage reforms.  All of these will require 
relatively heavy government spending before the end of 
October and thus before donor assistance starts.  In order to 
avoid another round of inflationary spending, he said, the 
Combined Approach to Budgetary Support (CABS) group of donors 
(which provide direct budgetary support) and the World Bank 
must release funds as early as possible. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
COMMENT: SPENDING DISCIPLINE, THEN QUICK DONOR REACTION 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5. (SBU) Whether Malawi falls into an inflationary spiral 
between now and the end of the calendar year depends on two 
things: the political will to reduce government spending, and 
the donors\' ability to respond quickly should the GOM 
succeed.  While it is still too early to judge the political 
will, the signs thus far are encouraging.  The Mutharika 
government has shown signs of independence from the United 
Democratic Front (UDF) old guard (former president Muluzi\'s 
allies) in several ways, including its resistance to requests 
for off-budget funding, its replacing the director of public 
prosecution, a declared intent to prosecute former ministers 
for corruption, and a halt to privatizations pending 
investigation of financial irregularities.  Mutharika\'s 
ability to change the GOM\'s spending behavior depends on his 
ability to garner support outside of established UDF/Muluzi 
circles, and in defiance of many entrenched political 
interests.  Whether he can do so remains to be seen. 
 
6. (SBU) If Mutharika succeeds in taming government 
profligacy, at least one hazard remains: the timing of 
foreign currency revenues at the end of the tobacco buying 
season.  With the CABS donors and World Bank holding 
disbursements until the GOM has established its fiscal 
responsibility more firmly, a balance of payments crisis is a 
real possibility.  These groups appear to want a clear signal 
from the IMF September review, a position we believe is 
prudent.  This means that if the GOM performs well, donors 
will have to move quickly to avoid a devaluation of the 
currency at precisely the time that the economy is most 
susceptible to inflation.  Mixed signals from the GOM on 
fiscal discipline or on the political stability needed to 
maintain that discipline will make a timely decision 
difficult.

SUBJECT: MALAWI EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WORSE OFF THAN 
BEFORE FREE PRIMARY EDUCATION 
 
REF: LILONGWE 706 
 
1. SUMMARY. According to the recently released \"Free 
Primary Education For All\" report, dropout rates, 
repetition rates, and qualified teacher-to-pupil 
ratios in public primary schools have all worsened 
over the past ten years.  At the same time, overall 
enrollment and government expenditures on public 
education increased.  Recent attempts by the 
Government of Malawi (GOM) to increase the number of 
qualified teachers demonstrate that the GOM 
recognizes that the quality of public education was 
compromised at the expense of quantity when Free 
Primary Education (FPE) was introduced in 1994.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Free Primary Education: 10 YEARS ON 
----------------------------------- 
2. Analyzing free primary education since its 
introduction ten years ago, the recently released 
\"Free Primary Education For All\" report, published by 
the Centre for Educational Research and Training at 
the University of Malawi, asserts that quality was 
compromised for quantity in an attempt to quickly 
implement Free Primary Education.  In its analysis of 
the education system the report looks at the 
relationship between public education spending and 
education outcomes in primary schools.  Primary 
school in Malawi, is supposed to begin at age six and 
last eight years. 
 
3. On education expenditure, the report notes that 
over the past ten years the GOM has increased its 
education budget every year, but the budget increases 
have not been proportional to the increasing student 
enrollment. Most of the money in the education budget 
goes for teachers\' salaries, leaving little money for 
expansion and maintenance of school facilities. 
 
4. Dropout rates have also dramatically increased. 
The report notes that over seventy percent of 
children who entered primary school between 1990-2000 
dropped out before finishing, with most citing the 
costs of school uniforms and supplies as the most 
common reasons.  The largest percentage of dropouts 
occurred the year free primary school was introduced, 
and the rate has marginally improved each year since. 
However, a higher percentage of students still drop 
out than before free primary education. 
 
5. In addition to high dropout rates, the majority of 
primary students have repeated at least one grade, 
which represents a twenty percent increase from the 
repetition rates prior to the introduction of FPE. 
The percentage of unqualified (untrained) teachers 
also rose from twenty percent prior to FPE to fifty 
percent four years later, and the number of pupils 
per English and Math textbook doubled because of the 
enrollment increases following the introduction of 
FPE. 
 
6. Officials, including the current Minister of 
Education, acknowledge that more planning should have 
gone into the introduction of FPE in 1994.  However, 
the education system\'s largest obstacle is budgetary 
constraints.  Last year, the Ministry requested MK 13 
billion ($130 million), and Parliament approved a 
budget of MK 6 billion ($60 million).  However, the 
amount actually received by the Ministry was less 
than MK 6 billion.  Of the Ministry\'s received 
funding, MK 4 billion ($40 million) went to pay 
teachers\' salaries.  The budget shortfalls have been 
left to members of the donor community to cover.  In 
1998 alone, donors provided almost ninty-five percent 
of the money spent on school facilities improvement 
and teacher training. 
 
7. According to the report, the introduction of free 
primary education in Malawi has not produced a system 
of universal primary education.  Even before 
factoring in dropout and grade repetition rates, only 
eighty percent of children enroll in school. 
Education in Malawi is not compulsory at any age. 
 
INTRODUCTION OF FPE 
------------------- 
8. Both of the major parties in the 1994 elections, 
the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and the United 
Democratic Front (UDF), promised free primary 
education.  The MCP stated that they would continue 
to gradually implement FPE, while the UDF did not 
publicly comment on their plan for FPE.  When the UDF 
won the presidential elections in May 1994, the 
President announced that primary schools would be 
free at the start of school in September. Prior to 
the implementation of FPS, the GOM did not undertake 
a study of the current educational system to see 
where improvements were needed. 
 
9. 3.2 million children signed up to attend school in 
September 1994, an enrollment increase of 70% from 
the previous year.  The GOM allowed any child to 
enroll in any grade, resulting in many overaged 
children attending school. There was a particularly 
large increase in Standard 8 (the last grade in 
primary school) enrollment, which suggested many 
children who had dropped out re-enrolled when school 
was free in the hopes of attending secondary school. 
To handle the increased number of students, the GOM 
hired 22,000 new teachers, 20,000 of whom were 
unqualified.  These teachers were given a two-week 
training course prior to being sent into the field. 
 
PRIOR TO FREE PRIMARY EDUCATION 
------------------------------- 
10. Prior to the introduction of FPE in Malawi, the 
school system had been funded primarily through 
student fees.  The enrollment figures of Malawian 
primary schools have been steadily increasing since 
Malawi gained its independence in 1964. Starting in 
the 1991-1992 school year, the GOM, along with help 
from the World Bank, began to introduce fee waivers 
for children in the first four years of primary 
school, as a way to entice parents to send their 
children to school.  The year that fee waivers were 
introduced there was a 40% increase in enrollment in 
the first grade of primary school, meaning that many 
parents were encouraged to enroll their children in 
school when the cost was drastically reduced or 
eliminated. 
 
11. The GOM along with USAID introduced the Girls\' 
Attainment in Basic Literacy and Education (GABLE) 
program in 1991-1992.  This program provided school 
fee waivers for non-repeating primary school girls in 
most primary school grades.  This program led to a 
twelve percent increase in primary school enrollment 
for girls. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
12. The decision to implement FPE four months after 
the 1994 elections was a way for the UDF to 
communicate to the rural masses that multi-party 
democracy meant big changes from Dr. Banda\'s elitest 
dictatorship.  GOM officials, however, expanded 
public education without taking into account the 
state of education in Malawi and the ability of the 
existing schools to handle the increased enrollment. 
That lack of planning before implementation continues 
to hinder the expansion of education in Malawi, ten 
years later.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (S) The June 2003 expulsion of five non-Malawian Muslims 
suspected of ties to Al-Qaida (AKA the \"Malawi Five\"), which 
the press characterized as and most Malawians believe to have 
been a USG-initiative, came at time when the Muslim-Christian 
divide was being exploited by politicians in the run-up to 
the 2004 presidential and parliamentary elections.  Though 
for different reasons, the event evoked fear and anger in 
both of Malawi\'s distinct Asian and Black Muslim communities, 
and in many ways united the two communities through a common 
anti-U.S. sentiment.  Though more challenging in the Asian 
Muslim community, creating a more positive opinion of the 
U.S. should be possible through intentional funding and 
programming to Muslim communities, using local Muslim 
organizations.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------- 
A BRIEF HISTORY 
--------------- 
 
The Early Days of Islam in Malawi 
--------------------------------- 
2. (U) Islam first made its way to Malawi in the late 1500s 
through Arab Muslim traders seeking new markets in the 
African interior via Lake Malawi.  Thus, the greater 
population of Muslims came to live along the lakeshore and on 
the banks of the Shire River.  Cultural practices of certain 
ethnic groups, such as the Yao, married well with Islamic 
customs and facilitated the spread of formalized Islam. 
 
3. (U) When Western missionaries began settling in Malawi in 
the late 1800s, they brought both Christianity and education 
with them.  Most missionaries required that children convert 
to Christianity prior to attending school, thus many 
indigenous inhabitants converted to Christianity, especially 
the Chewa people.  With education came economic opportunities 
and access to the external world. 
 
4. (U) Those who refused to convert to Christianity remained 
largely uneducated and, therefore, had fewer opportunities 
for economic betterment.  To date, many Black Muslims are 
still reluctant to send their children to government schools 
for fear of forced conversion.  The legacy of inequitable 
access to education and, by extension, economic opportunities 
has led to Black Muslim communities having the highest 
illiteracy rates in the country. 
 
5. (U) The Asian Muslim population came with the British 
colonial administration in the first half of the twentieth 
century.  With their international connections and superior 
access to education and economic resources, Asian Muslims 
quickly gained an important voice in the Malawian business 
sector.  Many of them are among Malawi\'s most wealthy 
individuals. 
 
Islamic Sects in Malawi 
----------------------- 
6. (SBU) Most Muslims in Malawi are Sunni.  The two main 
\"tariqa\" (\"brotherhoods\" or \"orders\"), both of which find 
their roots in Sufism, are Qadriyah (or Quadriya) and Sukuti 
(or earlier on Shadhiliyah).  Though both orders came to 
Malawi from Zanzibar via Lake Malawi, Qadriyah was dominant 
in the early days.  In the 1930\'s, a reform movement began 
(Shadhiliyah first, then later Sukuti) that preached against 
many of the syncretic forms of religious rites of the 
Qadriyah.  The reformists stressed the importance of Arabic 
literacy for religion and English literacy for secular 
communication. 
 
7. (SBU) By the 1960\'s, Asian Muslims in Malawi began funding 
the construction of mosques and the establishment of schools. 
 Their support went to the Sukuti branch.  Today, the newer, 
more impressive mosques and schools are Sukuti, and the 
smaller, poorer ones are Qadriyah.  Those Muslim Malawians 
who have contact with Muslims in other countries (or who have 
been educated outside the country) are generally Sukuti.  The 
Qadriyah often resent the Sukuti\'s superior access to 
resources and education, a sentiment that extends to 
organizations like the Muslim Association of Malawi (MAM), 
which is seen as a \"Sukuti organization.\"  The very small 
Shiite presence in Malawi is primarily composed of 
foreigners. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
MALAWI FIVE: THE SPARK OF ANTI-U.S. SENTIMENTS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
The Political Context 
--------------------- 
8. (S) The June 2003 expulsion of five non-Malawian (two 
Sudanese, two Turkish, and one Saudi) Muslims suspected of 
ties to Al-Qaida (AKA the \"Malawi Five\"), which the press 
characterized and most Malawians believe to have been a 
USG-initiative, came at time when politicians were using 
religion as a political issue in the run-up to the 2004 
presidential and parliamentary elections.  Ten years of 
Muslim former President Muluzi\'s administration and the 
recently-mandated public observance of Muslim holidays gave 
opposition political groups planks to build campaign 
platforms against the \"Islamization of Malawi.\"  While 
Muluzi\'s party and administration were not exclusively 
composed of Muslims, the message resonated well with 
opposition party Christian Malawians who saw Asian Muslims 
gaining economic influence and development projects going to 
the ruling party\'s strongholds.  Muluzi\'s party, the United 
Democratic Front (UDF), which was originally financed by 
Asian Muslims, won the 2004 presidential elections with a 
Christian presidential candidate and a Muslim vice 
presidential candidate. 
 
The Cultural Context: Asian vs. Black Muslims 
--------------------------------------------- 
9. (S) Malawi\'s Muslim community is by no means monolithic. 
The largest divide, between Asians and Black Malawians, is 
based on economic and socio-cultural differences, not 
religious beliefs.  The two communities do not worship at the 
same mosques or socialize at the same Islamic centers. 
Largely speaking, the two communities have little personal 
interaction. 
 
10. (S) The relationship between these two groups, which is 
important to understanding their distinct reactions to the 
\"Malawi Five,\" is that of giver and receiver.  By and large, 
within Muslim society, the Asians are the givers, and the 
Black Malawians are the receivers.  While there is little 
social interactions between the groups, their belief in Islam 
and observance of the \"zakat\" tradition (the Islamic custom 
of giving to those less fortunate) enables a nexus of 
positive interaction between the two groups and, to a certain 
extent, creates a bond of loyalty. 
 
11. (S) Several of the individuals in the Malawi Five group 
served as the functional link between these two communities. 
The Asians donated their zakat money to the organizations 
managed by the Malawi Five, and the Black Malawians benefited 
from the development projects and educational scholarships 
funded by the Malawi Five\'s organizations.  Both communities 
viewed the Malawi Five as \"local heroes,\" who gave 
continually of their time and resources and who served the 
Islamic community well.  More specifically, the Asians saw 
them as good members of the community and as well-intentioned 
friends; the Black Malawians saw them as development workers 
who affected real change in Black Muslims\' lives. 
 
Post \"Abduction\": Asian, Black Malawian Reactions Differ 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
12. (S) In many respects, the June 2003 expulsion of the 
Malawi Five united the Asian and Black Muslim communities by 
removing one of the principal link between them and giving 
them a common grievance against the U.S.  The expulsions 
evoked anger and fear in both groups, and no Malawian Muslims 
recognized (or even entertained the thought) that the Malawi 
Five could have been linked to extremist Islamic 
organizations.  Asian Muslims were angry because they felt 
their friends had been wronged and scared because they 
thought if these prominent members of their community were 
spied on, then any of them could also be subject to 
international scrutiny.  Black Malawians, on the other hand, 
were angry because the development projects they benefited 
from ceased and were scared because they thought if 
influential members of the community could be expelled, then 
any of them could also be subject to mistreatment, in a 
manner similar to what routinely occurred only ten years ago 
during President-for-Life Banda\'s regime. 
Post-Malawi Five Engagement 
--------------------------- 
13. (S) Because of the differing reasons behind their common 
reactions, post-Malawi Five engagement has required different 
strategies with the Asian and Black Muslim communities. 
Asian Muslims want venues to voice their opinions about the 
USG\'s foreign policy in the Middle East and still seek 
justice for their Malawi Five friends who they perceived to 
have been unjustly and illegally \"abducted\" from a country 
where they were doing good work.  Their concerns are not 
completely unfounded, because the Malawi Five were expelled 
extralegally by order of former President Muluzi and in 
defiance of a court order barring deportation.  For this 
reason, there is still a strong and continuing cold animosity 
toward the U.S. among Asian Muslims. 
 
14. (S) Black Malawians, on the other hand, have been more 
interested to engage with the USG on Islamic issues, such as 
the life of Muslims in the U.S. and developing US-Malawi ties 
between Muslim organizations.  Generally speaking, Black 
Muslims are looking for replacement of the benefits they lost 
when the Malawi Five were expelled from the country.  Focused 
programming and continued dialogue should go a long way to 
fostering good relations between Malawi\'s Black Muslims and 
the U.S. 
 
15. (S) NOTE: In the wake of the Malawi Five expulsions, post 
formulated and cleared carefully chosen language and press 
guidance which expressed support for the GOM\'s action, and 
also explained some of the reasons for the expulsions.  The 
statement was especially for use with the Asian Muslim 
community.  However, after local consultations and careful 
consideration, we determined it would actually be best not to 
use the statement, as vilifying the individuals or their 
organizations would not help the USG\'s cause.  The Malawi 
Five were so highly regarded and their organizations so 
widely respected that the statement would have likely further 
damaged the USG\'s credibility and been misconstrued as a 
confirmation of the USG\'s involvement in the expulsions. END 
NOTE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
MUSLIM PERSPECTIVES ON THE U.S.: USG VS. AMERICANS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
16. (S) Most Muslim Malawians, whether Asian or Black, view 
individual American citizens positively and often report good 
one-on-one interactions with Americans.  Their criticism, 
especially that of Asian Muslims, is generally focused on the 
USG and its foreign policy in the Middle East.  As most 
Malawians do not think their own government acts in their 
best interests, they often make the assumption that the USG\'s 
actions and policies are not rooted in American citizens\' 
opinions or political beliefs. 
 
------------------------- 
\"MUSLIM DONORS\" IN MALAWI 
------------------------- 
 
17. (S) The only Muslim nation diplomatic mission resident in 
Malawi is Libya, and continual delays have caused most 
Malawians to cast a skeptical eye on its promised development 
assistance.  Egypt also has a small diplomatic mission to 
Malawi.  (Most Muslim nations have non-resident coverage from 
Lusaka, Nairobi, or Pretoria.)  However, there are several 
Muslim aid organizations in Malawi, most of which build 
mosques and health clinics in Black Muslim communities and 
fund madrasses and scholarships for Black Muslim children. 
The larger internationally-funded organizations, like African 
Muslim Agency (AMA) and Youth Muslim Organization (YMO), also 
provide scholarships for international study to the brighter 
students in their madrasses.  In fact, some of the leaders in 
the Muslim Associations of Malawi (MAM), a predominantly 
Black Muslim umbrella organization, studied abroad in various 
Middle Eastern countries through such programs.  Several MFA 
officials also attended diplomatic tradecraft courses at the 
Pakistani equivalent of the Foreign Service Institute (FSI). 
 
18. (S) Local and international Muslim organizations with 
development and education projects in Malawi do not publicize 
their programs or coordinate with other NGOs and donors. 
They are normally active only in predominantly Muslim areas. 
Often the site of the only mosque in an area, the madrasa 
compounds are generally open to the surrounding communities 
for use.  Emboffs have visited many sites around Malawi and 
were warmly received and given free access to all the 
facilities.  In addition, most of the organizations welcomed 
more involvement with the USG, through both funding and 
programming. 
 
19. (SBU) The US Mission has in recent years done very little 
programming through and in support of local Muslim 
organizations, in part because Muslim organizations have not 
traditionally responded to proposal requests (even at post\'s 
prodding).

20. (S) Malawian Muslims\' concerns are not completely 
unfounded, and it should be noted that the USG and GOM\'s 
maladroit handling of the Malawi Five incident created many 
of them.  However, fostering a more positive attitude toward 
the U.S. among Malawian Muslims is by no means an impossible 
task, especially among Black Muslims.  And one of the most 
effective ways to do that is through focused funding and 
programming to Muslim organizations working in Muslim 
communities.  Since many local Muslim aid organizations are 
managed by Asian Muslims and benefit Black Muslims, using 
these local organizations (both Qadriyah and Sukuti) would be 
an effective vehicle to reach both Muslim communities.  Given 
previous reluctance to respond to post\'s proposal requests 
(whether because of political aversion, cultural differences, 
or capacity deficiencies), it will require creative thinking 
and intentional planning on post\'s part to integrate Malawi\'s 
previously ignored Muslim population into regular Mission 
programs. 
 
21. (U) COMMENT CONTINUED.  To facilitate USG involvement in 
and assistance to local Muslim organizations working in 
Muslim communities, post suggests the creation of a Muslim 
outreach fund that enables flexible small-scale funding, 
similar to the Ambassador\'s Special Self-Help Program.  Such 
a fund would give post an easy entree to local Muslim 
communities and would foster goodwill through tangible 
support.  END COMMENT.

1. (SBU) After only one year as a registered political party 
(and over three years of strong anti-United Democratic Front 
opposition), Brown Mpinganjira\'s National Democratic Alliance 
(NDA) has de-registered and merged with the UDF.  The party\'s 
August 9 decision to join the ruling party, which according 
to the press has not gone over well with the NDA\'s 
grassroots, comes after party president Mpinganjira announced 
the party\'s support for the UDF on June 18 (reftel A). 
 
2. (SBU) On UDF Chairman (and former President) Bakili 
Muluzi\'s recent whistle-stop tour \"to thank the party\'s 
supporters,\" Mpinganjira stood faithfully by Muluzi\'s side in 
what appeared to be an attempt to re-introduce the party\'s 
formerly wayward son.  To avoid having their seats declared 
vacant for \"crossing the floor\" by changing political 
parties, the NDA parliamentarians plan to remain independents 
in Parliament. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
3. (SBU) Mpinganjira, who was the UDF\'s most likely 2004 
presidential candidate when he was expelled from the party in 
2000, fell out of favor with then President Muluzi when he 
would not support Muluzi\'s bid for a third presidential term. 
 The creation of the NDA and opposition to the UDF that 
ensued were meant to attract Mpinganjira presidential votes 
in the 2004 elections.  After a dismal defeat (winning less 
than 9 percent of the vote), Mpinganjira has likely assessed 
the UDF\'s recent discontent with President Mutharika as his 
opportunity to position himself as the UDF\'s 2009 
presidential candidate.  In the meantime, the NDA\'s 
disgruntled grassroots supporters will likely align 
themselves with other opposition parties.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) A recent visit to Malawi\'s business capital, Blantyre, 
showed the private sector to be generally optimistic about 
the new administration\'s economic direction.  The consensus 
is that President Mutharika seems to be serious about cutting 
corruption and winning donor support through fiscal 
discipline.  While business leaders are reserving some 
measure of scepticism, they say sticking to modest reforms 
will drive economic growth. End summary. 
 
 
------------------- 
SURPRISING OPTIMISM 
------------------- 
 
2. (U) In the course of routine calls on a variety of private 
sector contacts in Blantyre, the financial and industrial 
center of Malawi, Econoffs heard a surprising level of 
optimism about the prospects of the new government led by 
President Bingu wa Mutharika.  Leaders from the finance, 
construction, agriculture, trade, transportation, and 
manufacturing sectors expressed approval of the 
administration\'s early moves against corruption and efforts 
to bring government spending under control.  Several of our 
interlocutors said that if Mutharika accomplishes nothing 
other than these two objectives, he would breathe new life 
into the Malawian economy. 
 
3. (SBU) The economic context of this optimism is decidedly 
grim in most respects: representatives from one sector after 
another told us that their part of the economy is stagnant at 
best, with steady shrinkage the norm.  A fund for small to 
medium-sized enterprises told us that high interest rates 
resulting from a decade of irresponsible government spending 
have made new investment all but impossible.  Whatever demand 
has survived in this contracting economy is being crowded out 
by an insatiable demand for public debt.  The largest 
commercial bank freely admits that two-thirds of its money is 
in government paper instead of loans.  Exporters and 
construction industry leaders described a crippling drain of 
skilled workers, deteriorated agricultural productivity, and 
a tarnished reputation in the international investment 
community. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
SOLID SIGNS OF CREDIBILITY 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Still, the prevailing sentiment agrees with the IMF 
Article IV team\'s report: that confidence in the economy is 
high enough to drive growth the instant interest rates come 
down (see ref A).  Mutharika\'s quick establishment of a 
government austerity program, his campaign to build public 
support for corruption prosecutions, and his apparent bid to 
establish a government independent from the ruling party (ref 
B), are evidently a sharp enough departure to cause hope. 
The chairman of the Malawi Stock Exchange and the managing 
director at a discount house told us money is beginning to 
show early signs of exiting the money market in favor of 
equities.  This is seen as a good sign that the financial 
community is beginning to believe the government\'s promises 
to bring spending under control.  Foreign exchange pressure, 
which could drive a devaluation and a round of inflation, is 
mercifully low, thanks to a weak dollar and the central 
bank\'s successful efforts to control the exchange rate (to be 
reported via septel). 
 
------------------------------------ 
COMMENT: NEW GOVERNMENT, NEW ECONOMY 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) While this sampling of private-sector opinion is 
hardly scientific, it does point to a clear common 
understanding of the economic situation in Malawi: that the 
main problem with the economy has been the government.  Only 
slightly less clear is the level of confidence in the 
Mutharika government\'s determination and ability to effect 
change.  The political will seems to be there, in our 
interlocutors\' view, but it seems too good to be true.  There 
is still some concern that Mutharika will be co-opted or 
out-maneuvered by more experienced politicians, or simply 
fall into the African corruption trap on his own.  The level 
of expectation for the government is modest (control spending 
and corruption, never mind other new initiatives), but the 
appraisal of Malawi\'s economic resilience is bright, provided 
the government can deliver on those modest expectations.

INCREASING, POLITICAL INTERFERENCE DECLINING 
 
REF: A. LILONGWE 400 
 
B. LILONGWE 403 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: A new era is dawning for the state 
media in Malawi.  The Malawi Broadcasting 
Corporation (MBC) and Television Malawi (TVM) 
have increased their coverage of different 
political perspectives after newly-elected 
government officials openly encouraged the two 
media houses to present opposition views. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Information minister Ken Lipenga, a seasoned 
journalist and former editor-in-chief of two 
independent daily newspapers, visited MBC and 
TVM offices on July 21 and assured journalists 
that no one would lose their job for 
interviewing members of the opposition. 
 
3.  The two media houses immediately acted upon 
Lipenga\'s instructions. Opposition leaders are 
being allowed to comment critically on 
government policies and other political 
developments. MBC\'s daily Press Review program 
has for the first time included both pro- and 
anti- government stories.  MBC has now started 
broadcasting a live phone in program allowing 
listeners to participate in political debates. 
 
4.  President Bingu Wa Mutharika and his 
administration are decreasing their use of 
state-run media for United Democratic Front 
(UDF) purposes. His first political rally as 
President, held a month after he took office, 
was by his own directive not broadcast live on 
MBC.  Explaining why the President rejected live 
coverage, Lipenga said the President felt the 
rally did not warrant such coverage because it 
was merely a political party function. 
Mutharika\'s directive received praise from 
surprised political analysts who described it as 
a marked departure from the \'destructive 
politics\' of his predecessor, Bakili Muluzi, who 
was notorious for his monopolization of state 
media resources. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
5.  Since the UDF came to power in 1994, the two 
public broadcasting services have come under 
fire for favoring the ruling party.  MBC\'s bias 
was most evident in the run-up to the May 20 
general elections when it completely closed the 
airwaves to the opposition (reftels); 
international election observers unanimously 
cited this bias as a limiting factor in the 
overall fairness of the elections.  Calls by 
civil society groups and other stakeholders for 
the two public broadcasters to level the playing 
field were unsuccessful and yielded little 
politically-balanced coverage. 
 
6.  The Malawi Communications Regulatory 
Authority (MACRA) did very little to encourage 
balanced news at MBC and TVM.  The two state-run 
institutions are not MACRA license holders and 
thus the regulatory body has very little 
authority over their broadcasting and 
operations.  MBC began broadcasting in 1964 as 
the only radio station in the country, and 
Television Malawi was established in 1996. 
MACRA was formed in 1998, and until MACRA\'s 
existence the two media houses were answerable 
only to the Ministry of Information.  Any media 
organization established after 1999 is required 
to obtain a MACRA license; however, TVM and MBC 
have not been required to do so, thus MACRA\'s 
authority has been limited.  MACRA has on 
several occasions threatened to withdraw 
broadcasting licenses from the Malawi Institute 
of Journalism Radio, Capital Radio and Radio 
Maria (Owned by Catholic Missionaries) on 
allegations that the three private radio 
stations air unbalanced news. 
 
7.  In principle, the ruling party has claimed 
to be a champion of press freedoms throughout 
its ten years in power.  During the same period 
the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) 
awarded Malawi the dubious honor of being ranked 
second only to Zimbabwe in the Southern African 
sub-region for the most number of reported media 
abuse incidents. Media oppression in this period 
included the closing down of private radio 
stations, arrests of private-media employees, 
political abuse of state media, and violence 
against journalists by the UDF\'s notorious youth 
wing, the \"Young Democrats\".  Journalists at MBC 
were fired for allegedly holding pro-opposition 
political views; many of these journalists have 
filed court cases against the GOM. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8.  Over the past two months, TVM and MBC have 
begun to show increasing signs of the ability to 
work free from political party influence and 
interference.  Opposition views are being aired 
even when directly critical of the President. 
The ruling party now must pay for dedicated 
coverage of party events, and the offer is open 
for other parties to do the same.  This progress 
is a good sign, but the ruling party\'s tolerance 
for the presentation of dissenting views is 
uncharted territory and equal access is by no 
means guaranteed.

REF: (A) 03 LILONGWE 909, (B) STATE 163967, (C) LILONGWE 
 
696 
 
1. This message is an update of reftel A, as requested 
reftel B. 
 
Laws and Regulations Proscribing Child Labor 
-------------------------------------------- 
2. According to Labor Commissioner Zebron Kambuto, the 
GOM is currently preparing a code of conduct to serve as 
a guide for labor officers to define and combat child 
labor.  In addition, Kambuto said the GOM has prepared 
an outline of weaknesses in the current legislation and 
plans to amend the legal framework regarding child labor 
in order to make labor policies and legislation more 
effective.  The proposed legislation changes will be 
reviewed at a stakeholder meeting in late August 2004. 
 
Implementation and Enforcement 
------------------------------ 
3. Discussing enforcement, Kambuto said during the 
previous year the GOM has trained about 120 labor 
officers in child labor monitoring, reporting and 
inspection.  There are a total of 150 labor 
officers/inspectors in the ministry, all of whom handle 
child labor investigation. Since the training took place 
in late 2003, the Ministry of Labor and Vocational 
Training (MOLVT) has held one refresher course. 
 
Formal Mechanisms to Investigate Complaints 
------------------------------------------- 
4. Turning to the investigative process, Kambuto said 
there were many incidents of child labor reported by 
district labor officers in all regions of the country. 
He said, however, there were no prosecutions or 
convictions in the past year.  Conceding that more 
prosecutions and convictions should have occurred, 
Kambuto said the GOM plans to intensify civic education 
about child labor, as many of the violations are a 
result of ignorance of the law. 
 
Social Programs to Prevent/Redress Child Labor 
--------------------------------------------- - 
5. In an effort to combat child labor, the Ministry has 
increased its partnerships with local and international 
NGOs, youth organizations, and other international 
organizations, such as UNICEF and ILO/OPEC.  The 
Elimination of Child Labor in Tobacco (ECLT) project has 
been addressing root causes of child labor by building 
schools and performing civic education.  These projects 
also included food security, agroforestry, water 
sanitation, and health components. 
 
6. Attempting to use local monitors in rural areas, the 
Ministry has organized youth village committees that 
monitor and report on child labor.  According to 
Kambuto, the local monitor projects have largely been 
successful because people in the villages have responded 
better to local authorities than to Ministry officials. 
Additionally, ILO/OPEC conducted civic education 
programs throughout the year using local media, 
particularly during July in observance of Child Labor 
Day. 
 
Comprehensive Policy for Worst Forms of Child Labor 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
7. In July 2004, the GOM released a study conducted by 
the Malawi National Statistical Office (NSO) designed to 
determine the magnitude of child labor in Malawi (reftel 
C).  The study included three parts: an assessment of 
child labor, a study on child prostitution, and a study 
on street children.  The report stated that one-third of 
Malawian children are involved in the report\'s 
definition of child labor.  The Ministry of Labor is 
currently reviewing the report and consulting with 
stakeholders in order to find ways to strengthen the 
GOM\'s legislative framework to increase protection for 
children. 
 
Comment 
------- 
8. Malawi requires resources to combat child labor and 
effectively implement related laws.  The Ministry 
conducts educational campaigns, but lacks the requisite 
human and financial resources to successfully implement 
programs.  Positive signs, especially the proposed code 
of conduct for labor officers, demonstrate the GOM\'s 
desire to eliminate child labor.  However, substantial 
improvement is not likely to occur until the GOM and its 
international partners make progress in reducing poverty 
and mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
1. (C) President Bingu wa Mutharika plans \"to open a 
behind-the-scenes dialogue\" with Zimbabwean President Robert 
Mugabe during a August 26-28 trip to Zimbabwe.  Mutharika, 
who will be in Zimbabwe to attend the annual Agricultural 
Society Show on August 27, is \"concerned\" about the situation 
in Zimbabwe because of its impact on Malawi, and he hopes to 
help \"promote peace and security in SADC\" through re-newed 
discussions.  During his short visit, Mutharika has no plans 
to meet with members of the opposition.  Minister of Foreign 
Affairs George Chaponda, who called the Western Heads of 
Mission together on August 23, said Mutharika wanted to 
explain his intention to meet with Mugabe to prevent any 
misunderstandings.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BRIEFING WESTERN MISSIONS ON MUTHARIKA\'S INTEREST IN ZIM 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
2. (C) Minister of Foreign Affairs George Chaponda, flanked 
by newly-appointed MFA PS Lucius Chikuni and Secretary to the 
President and Cabinet Bright Msaka, told the Heads of Mission 
from the British, French, German, European Union, and 
American Missions at a meeting on August 23 that President 
Bingu wa Mutharika will discreetly meet with Zimbabwean 
President Robert Mugabe during an August 26-28 visit to 
Zimbabwe.  According to Chaponda, Mutharika, who will attend 
the annual Agricultural Society Show in Harare on August 27, 
set the private meeting with Mugabe during the recent SADC 
Heads of State Conference in Mauritius because Mutharika 
wanted \"to open a behind-the-scenes dialogue\" with Mugabe. 
 
3. (C) Chaponda said the GOM, like the respective Western 
nations assembled at the meeting, is \"concerned\" about the 
situation in Zimbabwe.  Chaponda noted the issues in Zimbabwe 
have on impact on Malawi because Zimbabwe is Malawi\'s second 
largest trading partner and is home to many Malawians. 
Chaponda said Mutharika\'s interest to engage with Mugabe is 
because Mutharika thinks that Malawi, as a member of SADC, 
has a role to play in the region\'s peace and security. 
 
RE-ENGAGING MUGABE 
------------------ 
4. (C) According to Chaponda, Mutharika wanted to explain his 
plans to open discussions with Mugabe so that there was no 
misunderstanding about his intentions.  Chaponda also 
carefully noted that this initiative, although not entirely, 
was in response to demarches the UK and later the UK and EU 
recently gave regarding Zimbabwe.  Refering to Malawi\'s 
previous initiatives, Msaka commented that engagement with 
Zimbabwe had waned since the December 2003 Commonwealth Heads 
of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Abuja and that Mutharika\'s 
meeting would be a way of re-opening the regional dialogue 
former President Bakili Muluzi began.  Chaponda said 
Mutharika has no plans to meet with members of the opposition. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (C) The GOM has long been an advocate of behind-the-scenes 
dialogue with Zimbabwe, and, with the dust of the elections 
settling, Mutharika seems keen to pick up where Muluzi left 
off.  While we do not anticipate much will come of this 
initial meeting, it is possible that Mutharika will later 
become an effective avenue of communication.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) Malawi\'s new administration has been very public about 
its intention to bring corruption under control.  President 
Bingu wa Mutharika has replaced the chief government 
prosecutor, who in turn has publicly targeted several former 
ministers and ruling party members. The noise of a crackdown 
has garnered political support for Mutharika, and may buy 
just enough credibility to tip donors to release budgetary 
support sooner.  End Summary.

A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN 
--------------------- 
 
2. (U) Beginning with the controversial replacement of 
sitting Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Fahad Assani 
with novice lawyer Ishmael Wadi, the Mutharika administration 
has been loudly declaring war on corruption.  The DPP\'s 
office, which has sole authority to prosecute cases forwarded 
by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), had been seen as a 
barrier to rooting out corruption at the cabinet level. 
Under Assani, several cases involving ministers and senior 
ruling party officials had been refused, creating the 
perception that he would only go after \"small fish,\" and then 
only with permission from the Government. 
 
3. (U) Mutharika\'s July appointment of Wadi, who is only 
three years out of law school and has no experience with 
criminal law, was an early signal that he intends radical 
change.  Sacking Assani was a controversial move, which 
elicited a brief storm of protest (including calls for 
impeachment) and a civil lawsuit.  By early August, though, 
the controversy had died down, and Parliament unanimously 
confirmed Wadi. 
 
------------------------- 
NAMING NAMES IN THE PRESS 
------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Since his appointment, the new prosecutor has used the 
press to announce his targets, which include several former 
ministers and senior members of the ruling United Democratic 
Front (UDF) party.  The UDF is the party of both Mutharika 
and former president Bakili Muluzi. Significantly, his 
accusations have been seconded in the press by Mutharika\'s 
chief of staff, Ken Ng\'oma.  Mutharika confines his own 
anti-corruption statements to broad generalities, but UDF 
members have roundly criticized his staff\'s penchant for 
trial by press. 
 
5. (U) Accounts vary about who Wadi is targeting, but the 
most prominent potential cases are these: 
 
-- Humphrey Mvula, CEO of the parastatal Shire Bus Lines, 
deputy director of the UDF, and leader of the UDF\'s militant 
youth wing Young Democrats, who was arrested for malfeasance 
at Shire.  He was later released, but the press regularly 
quotes Wadi declaring his intent to prosecute Mvula.  Mvula 
has since been fired from Shire. 
 
-- Cassim Chalumpa, current vice president and former 
minister of finance and education, who is thought to have 
been involved in fraud involving school-building funds. 
 
-- Clement Stambuli, former information minister, suspected 
of unspecified malfeasance in office. 
 
-- Peter Fachi, former minister of justice; Patrick Mbewe, 
former local government minister; and Monjeza Maluza, former 
home affairs minister, for arranging the fraudulent sale of 
used Land Rovers to the GOM as new. Mbewe is also thought to 
have been involved in corruption around contracts for 
national ID cards. 
 
-- Friday Jumbe, former minister of finance, thought to have 
profited from illegal sales from the strategic grain reserves 
during the 2002 hunger crisis. 
 
-- Dumbo Lemani, former minister for water development, for 
manipulating the Petroleum Control Commission\'s fuel import 
allocations for personal profit. 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
LESS NOISE FROM THE PROFESSIONALS 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) The Anti-Corruption Board, which is responsible for 
investigating corruption but still cannot prosecute on its 
own, has kept comparatively quiet about specific cases.  They 
have talked publicly about a few investigations, including 
that of Chakufwa Chihana, the sitting minister of 
agriculture, who is alleged to have bribed local election 
officials leading up to the May 2004 elections.  They have 
also mentioned a new investigation into the suspicious death 
of Kalonga Stambuli, a long-time Muluzi associate who broke 
with him in the late 1990s, fled into exile, then returned in 
2003 as a Muluzi ally and investment banker.  Up to now, 
neither Wadi nor the ACB has named Muluzi as a target of any 
investigation, although he is the most obvious target--and 
the most dangerous (reftel A). 
 
7. (C) In a recent meeting with the DCM and pol/econoffs, the 
senior management of ACB indicated that it is now 
investigating or preparing to prosecute a number of cases 
involving officials \"at the very highest levels of 
government.\"  The Mutharika administration has decided in the 
last week to double ACB\'s operating budget, despite a general 
tightening of the state budget.  Even so, the ACB still has 
considerable capacity building to do, especially regarding 
international law enforcement cooperation and investigation 
of financial crimes. 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
COMMENT: BUYING POLITICAL SUPPORT, AND TIME 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Though the administration\'s public pronouncements have 
angered Muluzi loyalists, they seem to be popular with the 
opposition, to the extent that some observers now describe 
the President\'s UDF party as a de facto opposition.  This 
much is certain: the noise about corruption investigations is 
buying Mutharika some political independence from the old 
guard of the UDF, including Muluzi himself. 
 
9. (C) Whether this tactic will give him enough support to 
pursue a responsible fiscal agenda, and to defend his 
corruption-busting against more concerted political 
maneuvering from UDF, remains to be seen.  Among donors, who 
certainly constitute another intended audience, there is 
still some skepticism about the noise level.  They would be 
more impressed with court cases and convictions.  However, 
with a potential currency crisis perhaps two or three months 
away, the donors need to make a decision soon about whether 
to release funds.  In the absence of enough time to see the 
whole judicial process completed, noise alone might make a 
difference.

SUBJECT: MALAWI\'S CENTRAL BANK FIGHTS TO MAINTAIN KWACHA 
 
 
Classified By: Econoff William R. Taliaferro for reasons 1.5 b and d 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) With the Malawian kwacha under increasing pressure, 
the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) has so far managed to 
maintain its value by using a combination of methods, 
conventional and otherwise.  A small, heavily invested market 
with few speculative options has helped them up to now.  In 
the long run, RBM\'s tricks cannot substitute for a solid 
fiscal policy.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
CONVENTIONAL TOOLS: MORAL SUASION AND CAPITAL CONTROLS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2. (U) The Reserve Bank of Malawi describes its efforts to 
maintain the kwacha\'s value as a combination of intervention 
in the market and \"moral suasion,\" made the more effective by 
a lack of attractive investment alternatives to treasury 
bills.  This seems to be borne out by the continuance of 
fully subscribed T-bill auctions despite sharply lower 
interest rates and a higher volume of issuances over the past 
several months (though real rates, at about 15 percent, are 
still high).  Given most financial institutions\' already 
heavy stake in government paper, there is some incentive to 
keep buying simply in the fact that new issuances are largely 
financing current maturities.  Senior executives at the bank 
acknowledge that traditional tools, including higher 
liquidity reserve requirements (currently 27.5 percent) and a 
controlled capital account, are helping to keep speculative 
pressures down despite high liquidity and low foreign 
exchange reserves (1.5 months, against a normal seasonal 
reserve of 2.5 to 3 months). 
 
 
------------------------------- 
NOT-SO-MORAL SUASION WORKS, TOO 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Outside the bank, we have heard that the RBM is using 
other, less ethical tools as well.  The state-controlled 
tobacco auction is the main source of dollars in the economy. 
The bank has said that it is buying dollars from the auction 
floor to ensure timely transaction times and a consistent 
exchange rate, and is benefitting more or less incidentally 
from controlling the dollars.  According to a senior 
executive at the National Bank of Malawi, RBM is requiring 
the auctioneer to clear all dollar sales through the RBM, 
except for those deposited directly to dollar denominated 
accounts.  This gives RBM a monopoly on about half of the 
dollars flowing through the floor, to the (possibly illegal) 
exclusion of commercial banks. 
 
4. (C) The other instrument takes more direct aim at 
controlling speculation in the commercial banks.  According 
to a discount house executive, the RBM has threatened not to 
sell currency to banks if they do not observe an unofficial 
floor on the kwacha\'s value against the dollar (currently 
said to be MK110/dollar).  This measure has allegedly been 
used in the past on Stanbic Bank, at a measurable cost in 
market share. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
COMMENT: IN THE LONG RUN, IT\'S ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (C) Nearly every informed observer of the kwacha 
characterizes its position as precarious.  The RBM has 
succeeded up to now in defending its currency, despite thin 
reserves and, until June, increasingly inflationary spending 
by government.  The bank is quick to say the market here is 
so small that normal market dynamics (according to which a 
lowering of rates would lessen demand) do not apply.  This is 
their logic for arguing against the IMF\'s demands for higher 
bank rates: since rate changes seem not to affect demand for 
government paper, the GOM should pay as little as the market 
will bear.  To the extent that RBM can squelch other 
investment opportunities, and they evidently can, the 
situation will probably stay contained for the time being. 
In the longer run, though, the bank\'s machinations have to be 
backed by a responsible fiscal policy.  So far, the Mutharika 
government appears to be cognizant of the danger and 
determined to avoid it.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) Elected by a small margin and achieved only with 
former President Bakili Muluzi\'s support, President Bingu wa 
Mutharika has made surprisingly independent strides in 
rooting out corruption, instilling fiscal discipline, and 
professionalizing government.  His operating assumption is 
that if he runs government well, he will garner the support 
necessary to carry out reforms, with or without Muluzi and 
the United Democratic Front (UDF).  However, with Mutharika\'s 
technocratic approach to running government has come a 
general disregard for the public\'s perception of his actions 
and a disinterest in managing the politics of the presidency. 
 Mutharika has also given very little attention to HIV/AIDS 
and privatization.  While he is still learning the boundaries 
of his power, Mutharika is faring well in regaining the 
international community\'s confidence in the government of 
Malawi, which will ultimately unlock financial resources. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
SEPARATING PARTY AND STATE: UDF VS. GOM 
--------------------------------------- 
2. (C) Since his inauguration on May 24, President Bingu wa 
Mutharika\'s biggest political problems have been with his own 
party.  A move to make the ruling United Democratic Front 
(UDF) party separate from government, coupled with a 
disinterest in managing the politics that go with the 
presidency, has left Mutharika outside the party fold and 
caused party loyalists to question his allegiance to the UDF. 
 Muluzi, as party chair, continues to demonstrate that he 
rules the UDF by making whistle-stop tours and by managing 
the internal party politics.  Without Muluzi, Mutharika would 
likely take additional steps to make a more clear distinction 
between the UDF and the GOM, but Mutharika would also have an 
unruly UDF on his hands, ready to actively work against the 
administration\'s reform initiatives. 
 
ROOTING OUT CORRUPTION: ON THE ROAD TO ZAMBIA? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
3. (C) With Mutharika\'s zero-tolerance policy on corruption 
and repeated statements about prosecuting offenders at all 
levels of government, civil society and the media have 
speculated that Muluzi will be brought to book (reftel A). 
Officials at the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) have also 
intimated that they plan to prosecute \"at the very highest 
levels of government\" (reftel B).  In order to preempt a 
Zambia-style corruption investigation, Muluzi has tried to 
make Mutharika politically dependent on him (reftel C). 
However, continuing tension between Muluzi and Mutharika 
indicate that Muluzi\'s plans have not been successful and 
that Mutharika sees little value in Muluzi\'s political stock. 
 If the ACB does investigate Muluzi for corruption, it is 
unlikely that Mutharika will protect him, as Mutharika 
promised to do during the campaign period. 
 
MAKING A PROFESSIONAL GO OF IT 
------------------------------ 
4. (C) Most impressive since Mutharika took office has been 
his commitment to appointing professionals to senior GOM 
positions.  The cabinet is largely composed of qualified 
technocrats, and the Director of Public Prosecutions, Army 
Commander, and Secretaries to the President and Cabinet are 
all qualified individuals.  A focus on putting the right 
people in the right jobs has resulted in a re-ordering of the 
principal secretaries in all ministries and has reverberated 
through the civil service as a demand to perform.  Also 
encouraging is the seemingly independent operation of these 
individuals with the authority of their offices, which was 
not the case under Muluzi. 
 
5. (C) While Mutharika\'s \"professional government\" has been 
well received by civil society and the media, his dismantling 
of Muluzi\'s political patronage system and empowerment of 
government offices to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing 
have increased the tension between Mutharika and Muluzi\'s old 
guard in the UDF.  Many of Muluzi\'s most loyal, now the 
subject of corruption investigations, are embittered and have 
only been kept in check by Muluzi.  Without Muluzi, there 
would be a much more vocal opposition to Mutharika in the UDF. 
 
NOTABLY ABSENT: HIV/AIDS AND PRIVATIZATION 
------------------------------------------ 
6. (C) Although Mutharika has given fiscal discipline and the 
government budget a great deal of attention, he has put 
privatization of statutory corporations on hold.  The 
privatization of Malawi Telecommunications, Limited (MTL) was 
frozen in final negotiations almost as soon as Mutharika took 
office, without announcement or explanation.  Although 
Mutharika\'s economic reforms have produced optimism in the 
private sector (reftel D), his statist economic origins 
remain a clear influence in his policies.  How Mutharika 
treats the parastatals will reveal much about his commitment 
to private sector as the engine of economic growth. 
 
7. (C) Apart from a few statements at the recent SADC 
Heads-of-State meeting in Mauritius, Mutharika has said 
almost nothing about HIV/AIDS.  With an infection rate of 
over 14 percent dramatically affecting Malawi\'s productivity 
and large amounts of resources coming for prevention and 
treatment, the Mutharika administration will have to take a 
more active role in HIV/AIDS leadership to make meaningful 
gains. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (C) Mutharika has a window of opportunity in that most 
Malawians genuinely believe that with proper leadership, 
corruption can be controlled and the economy will turn 
around.  In addition, the international community is eager to 
resume financial support.  Mutharika\'s initial gestures 
toward reform have done much to regain the GOM\'s credibility, 
which Muluzi seriously wounded in the run-up to the 
elections.  However, while Mutharika has thus far been able 
to garner political support by \"doing the right thing,\" he is 
not as politically astute as his predecessor.  He does not 
recognize the importance perception plays in politics, and he 
does not realize the value of loyalty in partisan politics. 
 
9. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED. As Mutharika continues to bank on 
opposition support, Muluzi will try to prove his political 
worth to Mutharika by keeping the UDF old guard in check and 
working the grassroots for support for the UDF.  In the end, 
Mutharika may find that he needs Muluzi more than he thinks 
in order to affect political change, and Muluzi will be an 
eager aide in order to protect and position himself in the 
long-term.  END COMMENT.

REF: A. STATE 168472 
 
     B. LILONGWE 821 
     C. LILONGWE 696 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: Malawi meets AGOA eligibility requirements 
for 2004.  The GOM continues to liberalize its economy to a 
market-based model, improve rule of law, remove barriers to 
trade and investment, reduce poverty through economic policy, 
combat corruption, and protect worker rights.  AGOA benefits 
have driven steady growth in Malawi\'s garment industry over 
the past year, one of the bright spots in a generally 
stagnant economy.  Malawian leadership recognizes the 
importance of AGOA\'s contribution to growth in the 
manufacturing sector and is committed to maintaining AGOA 
eligibility.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) MARKET ECONOMY: Malawi continues to move from the 
predominantly state-controlled economy of the Banda years to 
a market-based economy.  The Privatization Commission was 
established shortly after political liberalization and has 
privatized 68 companies since 1996.  Several large and 
profitable state enterprises were privatized in 2003, 
including the country\'s fabric manufacturer and a large grain 
milling operation.  The state telecommunications company is 
in the final stages of a privatization deal, and other 
state-owned utilities are targeted for privatization in the 
near to medium term.  President Mutharika has instituted a 
temporary moratorium on privatizations, with the stated 
objective of ensuring financial probity in pending deals. 
The GOM encourages domestic and foreign investment in most 
sectors of the economy, without restrictions on ownership or 
size of investment.  The Competition and Fair Trading Act is 
aimed at strengthening the private sector by regulating and 
monitoring monopolies and protecting the interests of the 
consumer.  Malawi\'s macroeconomic problems, mainly a result 
of fiscal indiscipline, have hampered liberalization to some 
extent, but we anticipate that stability on this front will 
bring further liberalization. 
 
3. (SBU) RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL PLURALISM, DUE PROCESS: 
Malawi\'s fledgling democracy held its third democratic 
elections in May 2004 and saw a peaceful first transition 
between democratically elected presidents.  International 
observers noted several shortcomings in the electoral 
process, including inequitable access to the state-owned 
media, the ruling party\'s use of state resources to campaign, 
and poor planning and administration by the Electoral 
Commission.  Without meaningful public discussion of the 
issues and without reasonable confidence in the Electoral 
Commission\'s handling of the process, the Malawi elections 
lacked some key elements of a fully democratic process. 
Since the election, however, there has been an active public 
debate about the Commission\'s performance, and the head of 
the Commission has since resigned.  Although no political 
party won an outright majority in Parliament, the ruling 
party secured a working majority through alliance building. 
In addition to the eight political parties represented in the 
House (up from four), a record number of independents won 
seats. 
 
4. (U) BARRIERS TO U.S. TRADE AND INVESTMENT: Malawi is a 
member of the WTO and two regional trading blocs: SADC and 
COMESA.  Through these organizations, the country has adopted 
a substantially free and fair trade regime.  Real barriers to 
trade and investment are nearly all practical: transport 
costs, infrastructure gaps, and macroeconomic problems.  The 
GOM participates actively in the National Action Group, a 
forum for government, private industry, and civil society to 
jointly guide policy for trade, investment, and private 
sector development. 
 
5. (U) POVERTY REDUCTION: The GOM has had an active poverty 
reduction strategy since at least 2000, as part of the Highly 
Indebted Poor Countries debt relief initiative.  It is 
currently under consideration for assistance from both the 
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, following 
suspension by both institutions in the last year of former 
president Muluzi\'s second term.  Both institutions consider 
the new administration to be making great progress toward 
fiscal responsibility.  The IMF is expected to institute a 
Staff Monitored Program in September, and the Bank is 
expected to begin a structural adjustment credit in the same 
month.  The GOM works closely with these international 
financial institutions, and with donor states, in setting the 
direction of Malawi\'s spending on pro-poor expenditures, 
which are currently at 6.5 percent of GDP.  GOM policies 
place special emphasis on education, health, agriculture, and 
private sector development. 
 
6. (SBU) COMBATTING CORRUPTION: Malawi\'s new president has 
made fiscal responsibility, good governance, and 
anti-corruption efforts his top priorities.  Funding for the 
generally effective Anti Corruption Bureau has been doubled, 
and the Director of Public Prosecutions has been replaced, as 
has the Attorney General.  Several high-level political 
figures have been named as targets for investigations and 
pending prosecutions.  While it is still early for 
convictions, all signs are that the GOM is finally committed 
to rooting out corruption. 
 
7. (U) WORKER RIGHTS: Malawi\'s labor laws are mostly in 
compliance with the ILO\'s core labor standards.  A chronic 
lack of resources continues to hamper enforcement, however. 
The Constitution and employment laws comply with the Minimum 
Age Convention (ILO 138), and the Worst Forms of Labor 
Convention (ILO 182).  Bound by limited resources, the GOM 
has yet to realize its plans for a public education program 
on child labor, and focuses on the underlying conditions for 
child labor, including rural poverty and the impact of 
HIV/AIDS on families and the labor force. 
 
8. (SBU) Embassy considers that despite periodic setbacks, 
Malawi is making progress in its AGOA eligibility measures. 
The 2004 elections may represent a step forward in many 
areas, particularly in achieving macroeconomic stability and 
reestablishing good governance.  In view of this and of the 
substantial benefits of AGOA to date, we strongly recommend 
that Malawi remain eligible for AGOA.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU) In line with President Bingu wa Mutharika\'s 
commitment at the recent African Union Summit to have Malawi 
reviewed by the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), a 
preliminary report commissioned by the GOM finds \"significant 
gaps\" in economic management, a need for executive branch 
checks, prohibitively high costs for businesses, and a fiscal 
crisis starving social sector funding.  Also noted is a 
\"major and growing problem\" of corruption.  Aptly describing 
the challenges the Mutharika administration faces, the South 
African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA) report 
rightly characterizes the GOM\'s focus (especially under 
Muluzi) on getting things right on paper, but missing the 
larger goals of implementation and genuine progress.  Looking 
to the future, while development initiatives in Malawi are 
still largely donor driven, holding the GOM to commitments 
and withholding aid when appropriate (as with the GOM\'s 
current IMF relationship) seem to be effective tools in 
shifting the GOM\'s focus from pro forma to performance.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) In keeping with the GOM\'s plan to accede to the 
African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) as announced by 
President Bingu wa Mutharika at the recent African Union 
Summit in Addis Ababa, the Ministry of Economic Planning and 
Development commissioned the South African Institute of 
International Affairs (SAIIA) to prepare a preliminary 
assessment of the implications of peer review for Malawi and 
a list of recommendations.  The report, released on August 
15, is based on field work done earlier in the year. 
 
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE 
---------------------------------- 
3. (U) The SAIIA report says Malawi \"has significant gaps\" in 
its economic management and governance.  The report indicates 
that the GOM \"has been living well beyond its means for 
several years\" and, as a result, there is \"a crisis of debt 
and donor confidence.\"  The report says that Malawi has 
proper laws governing economic management, but that 
\"disciplined implementation and leadership to command 
compliance with existing rules\" are lacking.  The budget 
process is described as \"fiction\" that results in \"budget 
plans prepared by government (that) bear little resemblance 
to actual spending.\"  The current cash management system, the 
report concludes, \"is tantamount to a hidden second budget 
that is not accountable to Parliament and determined not by 
rational strategy but political influence behind the scenes.\" 
 Of the four factors considered during the APRM, Malawi \"has 
by far the worst performance in fiscal and economic 
governance.\" 
 
DEMOCRACY AND GOOD POLITICAL GOVERNANCE 
--------------------------------------- 
4. (U) While noting significant improvements since the 1994 
advent of multi-party democracy, the SAIIA report terms 
Malawi as a democracy that allows \"presidential rule by a 
minority,\" which will likely lead to a \"greater reliance on 
ethnic and regional loyalties.\"  Tensions in the 2004 
electoral process were \"compounded by credible complaints of 
unfair election management and diversion of government 
resources toward ruling party campaigns.\"  The report also 
notes that the rule of law and the Constitution have been 
eroded by \"crucial aspects of the balance of powers (being) 
intentionally subverted\" by the Muluzi administration. 
According to the report, key checks on the executive branch 
should be strengthened by parliamentary independence, 
electoral freedom, and fiscal oversight. 
 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND CORRUPTION 
----------------------------------- 
5. (U) Observing weak laws governing money laundering, 
bankruptcy, commercial dispute settlement and shareholder 
rights, the SAIIA report suggests the GOM improve the 
business and investment climate by \"improving regulation, 
responding more quickly to tariff and trade problems, and 
reducing the costs of doing business in the country.\" 
 
6. (U) The report also determines that \"corruption is a major 
and growing problem in Malawi,\" which is a result of \"lax 
management of government financial affairs.\" 
 
SOCIOECONOMIC GOVERNANCE 
------------------------ 
7. (U) In socioeconomic governance, the APRM report says 
Malawi initially had a good Poverty Reduction Strategy to 
meet the UN Millennium Development Goals, but that \"fiscal 
crisis is increasingly starving social sectors of funding.\" 
The report suggests Malawi needs to \"fundamentally re-think 
its strategy in many social sectors,\" concentrating on 
follow-through. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (SBU) We welcome Malawi\'s inclusion in the African Peer 
Review Process, as it is a step in the right direction to 
increasing the GOM\'s transparency.  This preliminary report 
rightly characterizes the GOM\'s focus (especially under 
Muluzi) on getting things right on paper, but missing the 
larger goals of implementation and genuine progress. 
Recognizing these shortcomings, the Mutharika administration 
appears to be focused on re-establishing the GOM\'s 
international credibility through keeping promises and 
implementing reforms. 
 
9. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED. Also of note in the report is the 
conclusion that in order for Malawi to receive continued 
support from the international community, the GOM needs to 
respond to donor nations\' \"shift in attitudes\" to concentrate 
on well-performing governments that enthusiastically embrace 
good governance and combat corruption.  While development 
initiatives in Malawi are still largely donor-driven, holding 
the GOM to commitments and withholding aid when appropriate 
(as with the GOM\'s current IMF relationship) seem to be 
effective tools in making the GOM focus on a bottom line of 
performance.  END COMMENT.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Based on performance in its first 100 days in office, 
the administration of President Bingu Wa Mutharika appears to 
be focusing effectively on fiscal discipline.  Recent 
consultations with Ministry of Finance officials and resident 
staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World 
Bank, as well as actions on the part of the GOM, indicate 
responsible budgeting and performance ahead of IMF targets. 
Based on this record, Embassy would not object to release of 
World Bank structural adjustment credit funds.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
FISCAL DISCIPLINE, REALISTIC BUDGET 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In his first 100 days, Mutharika has focused strongly 
on fiscal discipline and good governance.  As reported 
elsewhere (reftel), the new GOM has taken an aggressive 
public stance on corruption, backed by key personnel changes 
and increased funding.  On the fiscal side, the 
administration has cut the size of the cabinet, cut 
government-wide travel budgets, established and enforced 
monthly spending ceilings on the ministries, and adopted a 
more disciplined approach to government procurement.  A 
preview of the new budget, which is to be presented to 
Parliament on September 3, shows realistic planning in place 
of the donor-pleasing austerity of past budgets (which were 
routinely displaced by supplementary budgets, then just as 
routinely overrun). 
 
3. (C) The current budget is for total government spending of 
MK87 billion ($813 million), with a deficit of MK8 billion 
($75 million, or 4 percent of GDP).  While the budget 
contains several items of questionable economic criticality 
(for example, provisions for the GOM to import grain for the 
commercial market), it appears to include most, though not 
all, foreseeable expenditures.  The budget does include a 
civil service wage reform package, which has been called out 
by the international financial institutions as a badly needed 
structural reform. It does not include a possible 
Parliamentary pay hike, by-elections costs, nor possible 
outlays associated with moving government operations from 
Blantyre to Lilongwe.  Finance minister Goodall Gondwe 
acknowledges these as gaps in the budget, saying the GOM 
either has yet to decide these issues, or has not yet 
estimated the possible expenditures.  In general, there are 
very few changes since the IMF\'s Article IV mission reviewed 
the draft budget in late July. 
 
4. (C) According to Gondwe, there is some upside implicit in 
the budget, from a possible break in interest rates, 
replacement of short-term debt with cheaper long-term debt, 
and revenues from taxes implicit in the civil service reform 
package.  In conversations with donors, he has said the GOM 
may come close to balancing the budget by fiscal year end. 
 
 
---------------------- 
IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE 
---------------------- 
 
5. (C) The in-country IMF staff, which is conducting weekly 
performance reviews with the GOM and the central bank, has 
tracked Malawi\'s performance through 20 August.  The results 
are impressive: the new government has so far stayed within 
all quantitative targets.  The single most important measure, 
net domestic assets of the central bank (i.e., GOM\'s domestic 
debt), is an impressive MK4 billion ($37.3 million) lower 
than the target MK6 billion ($56 million).  Even if the GOM 
goes ahead with a MK2.9 billion ($27 million) grain buy--the 
largest likely hit to the budget--it will still be well below 
the IMF debt ceiling. 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) Up to now, the Mutharika administration appears to be 
following a responsible fiscal course, both in spending 
against its interim budget and in creating a realistic budget 
for the balance of the fiscal year.  Given the upcoming 
seasonal pressure on the kwacha, and the budgetary pressure 
to stop growing domestic debt, the GOM is justifiably anxious 
to get budgetary and balance of payment support flowing at 
the earliest possible moment.  Only time will tell the 
difference between donor-pleasing gestures and a lasting 
commitment to reform, but it is clear that delaying support 
will worsen Mutharika\'s chances of reforming Malawi\'s 
economy.  Based on the current GOM\'s performance to date, and 
on the fragility of the economic situation, Embassy would 
have no objection to the immediate release of the first 
tranche of World Bank structural adjustment funds.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (SBU/NF//FOUO) In a resource poor environment, the Malawi 
Defense Force (MDF) highlights prevention as its main 
campaign against HIV/AIDS, but has recently scaled up its 
voluntary counseling and testing services as well as care and 
treatment programs.  USG assistance has helped position the 
MDF to expand program offerings, as Global Fund and other 
resources come on line.  Although the MDF\'s infection rate 
likely remains near fifty percent, strong leadership and 
effective programs are mitigating the pandemic\'s impact and 
are likely to regain the ground the MDF has lost to HIV/AIDS. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
RECRUITING A LOW INFECTION RATE, FOCUSING ON PREVENTION 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
2. (SBU/NF//FOUO) Since 2000 when the Malawi Defense Force 
(MDF) began taking new recruits after a four year, 
budget-driven hiatus, military entrance exams have included 
an HIV/AIDS test.  Although the MDF has not made the policy 
public, applicants who test positive fail the health section 
of the entrance exam and are not admitted to the military. 
Once the new recruits begin basic training, they take 
HIV/AIDS specific courses in an effort to keep new recruits 
seronegative.  In addition, HIV/AIDS components have been 
added to all courses at the Malawi Armed Forces College 
(MAFCO) and are taught to everyone from enlisted personnel to 
seasoned officers.  The current HIV/AIDS education and 
prevention training material was funded by the Naval Health 
Research Center (NHRC) through the Defense HIV/AIDS 
Prevention Program (DHAPP). 
 
VCT SERVICES SCALE-UP WITH USG SUPPORT 
-------------------------------------- 
3. (SBU/NF//FOUO) Since NHRC/DHAPP began supporting the MDF 
in FY03, the MDF has opened three voluntary counseling and 
testing (VCT) centers at its three principal barracks.  The 
centers offer the range of VCT services, including rapid 
testing, behavior counseling, and prevention education, and 
are open to service members living on the barracks and 
civilians in surrounding communities.  To reduce the stigma 
associated with individuals visiting VCTs, all three sites 
have started offering basic clinical services as well. 
 
4. (SBU/NF//FOUO) DHAPP funds have also helped support the 
MDF\'s home-based care program.  However, the program is not 
yet fully operational because of hiccups with funding for 
training from the National AIDS Commission (NAC). 
 
USING NEW WEAPONS: ARV ROLL-OUT 
------------------------------- 
5. (SBU/NF//FOUO) With the GOM\'s national mandate of two 
percent of government agency budgets going to HIV/AIDS 
programs, the MDF recently started offering an 
anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy program for MDF personnel and 
their families at the barracks in Lilongwe.  The program 
currently has 75 individuals enrolled and is supported by six 
ARV-trained MDF medical professionals.  MDF HIV/AIDS 
Coordinator LTC Mafumu Gondwe said the program will be 
expanding to other military facilities in October as a result 
of Global Fund support. 
 
6. (SBU/NF//FOUO) In recent months, the percentage of 
infected visitors to the MDF\'s VCTs has been on the rise. 
According to Gondwe, offering clinical services and the 
provision of ARV therapy are the reasons.  Gondwe says MDF 
personnel are much more willing to come forward and face 
HIV/AIDS when they know they have treatment options 
available. 
 
THANKFUL FOR USG SUPPORT 
------------------------ 
7. (SBU/NF//FOUO) Gondwe and the MDF\'s senior leadership 
routinely thank the USG for supporting the military\'s 
HIV/AIDS program.  According to Gondwe, as the first to 
support the MDF\'s program, the USG has positioned the 
military to take advantage of Global Fund resources before 
other GOM agencies.  At present, the MDF is considered to be 
a leader in the GOM on HIV/AIDS response, prevention, and 
treatment. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (SBU/NF//FOUO) Resources have limited the size of the 
MDF\'s HIV/AIDS program, but not its quality.  As more 
resources come on line, treatment and care programs will be 
expanding, but the MDF plans to maintain its primary focus on 
prevention.  With the senior command committed to delivering 
high quality HIV/AIDS programs and the recent influx of 
resources, the MDF should see its infection rate decrease in 
the medium-term.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: GOM DISSATISFIED WITH TIP REPORT 
 
REF: A) LILONGWE 723   B) STATE 184081 
 
1.  In a Note Verbale dated August 20, the GOM has once 
again expressed its dissatisfaction with its Tier 2 - Watch 
List ranking.  As reported in reftel A, the GOM takes issue 
with the content of the 2004 TIP report and maintains it 
has taken necessary steps to combat TIP in the country. 
 
2. Text of Note Verbale: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Malawi 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United 
States of America and has the honor to refer to the Report 
issued by the United States of America State Department on 
the situation of Human Trafficking and Prostitution in 
Malawi. 
 
The Ministry wishes to repeat concerns already conveyed to 
the esteemed Embassy on the claims made in the Report and 
reiterate the same does not reflect the reality of the 
situation in the country.  Specifically, the Ministry 
observes that the Report, which erroneously categorizes 
Malawi as a TIER 2 Watch List Country, is exaggerated and 
not professionally done. The Report is debatable and not 
substantiated by a list of identifiable interviewees, 
credible sources or reliable statistics. 
 
The Ministry has consulted various agencies in the country 
that are experts on this but failed to find any information 
that could support the picture painted by the Report. 
There may have been in the past a few isolated incidences, 
and there are bound to be some few cases in the future, but 
it is contended that the situation has not escalated to the 
extent portrayed by the Report. 
 
Malawi has [an] effective legal regime, which is capable of 
adequately addressing the problem of human trafficking and 
prostitution.  Specifically, the Constitution and Penal 
Code have a Chapter exclusively dealing with Offenses 
Against Morality.  It covers offences such as Prostitution; 
Leaving [sic] on Earnings of Prostitution; Taking People 
Either Within or Outside Malawi for Prostitution; Taking 
People Away to be in Brothels Whether Willingly or Against 
Their Consent; among other offences. 
 
The Ministry also notes that Malawi has signed critical 
Conventions and Protocols aimed at addressing the problem 
of human trafficking and prostitution including the 
following: 
(i) The Convention for the Suppression of Traffic in 
Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of 
Others, adopted in New York, in March 1950. 
(ii)Final Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of 
the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the 
Prostitution of Others, New York 1950. 
 
The Ministry further wishes to correct the impression that 
the Penal Code Bill which was presented to Parliament was 
withdrawn.  Instead, Members of Parliament asked for more 
time to study the Penal Code (Amendments) Bill No. 12 in 
order to appreciate certain concepts which they found novel 
and inconsistent with cultural values.  The Bill will be 
re-introduced at an appropriate time once Members of 
Parliament have finalized consultations.  It is pertinent 
to mention, however, that the Amendment Bill No. 12 was 
merely aimed at addressing mutations and permeations of the 
offence.  The Government of Malawi strongly feels it has 
adequate provisions to prosecute any persons engaging in 
human trafficking or prostitution. 
 
Malawi is committed to stop and stamp out human trafficking 
and prostitution, and will leave no stone unturned in its 
quest to fight organized crimes of this nature. 
 
The Ministry reiterates that Malawi is ready and willing to 
work with any agency which has credible information that 
would help, if any, in cracking down on any known or 
identifiable gangs or groups of persons in human 
trafficking or prostitution. 
 
Further, the Government welcomes experts, if any, who have 
information on the purported inadequacies of its laws other 
than the way it is proposed to improve the efficiency by 
sealing loopholes and technicalities in the legislation. 
 
The Ministry refutes the claim made in the Report which 
seem to be premised on a single incident, which took place 
some five or more years ago.  If anything, the Government 
of the Republic of Malawi has been blamed by Human and 
Women Rights groups for its uncompromising stance against 
prostitution.  It is frustrating and ironic for a country 
with such determination in its fight against prostitution 
to be placed in a TIER 2 Watch list. 
 
The Ministry would, accordingly, appreciate a review of its 
case based on the real situation as exists on the ground so 
that a genuine classification is given. 
(Standard Complimentary Closing) 
 
End text of Note Verbale. 
 
3.  COMMENT. The new government of President Mutharika is 
clearly taking this issue very seriously.  The President 
called an interministerial meeting on July 28 to discuss 
the report with representatives of the ministries of Home 
Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Gender, Child 
Welfare, and Community Services.  The Foreign Minister has 
personally assured us that appropriate legislation and 
international instruments will be brought into force.  The 
Minister of Gender, Child Welfare, and Community Services 
will for the first time be present at the UNGA, likely in 
response to the report and the USG\'s anti-trafficking 
agenda there. 
 
4.  COMMENT CONTINUED.  The GOM has already begun action on 
some of the items in reftel B, but lack of resources will 
make it difficult to fully achieve all of the goals set out 
by G/TIP.  Civil society, international donors, and NGOs 
will be necessary partners in implementing these laws and 
developing capacity to assist victims.  If the GOM proposes 
effective TIP laws to Parliament and ratifies the 
international instruments, then we believe that Malawi will 
merit Tier Two with no/no Watch List. END COMMENT

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) President Bingu wa Mutharika has unexpectedly replaced 
the director of Malawi\'s Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB).  This 
move comes as a commision report on corruption at the state 
agricultural monopoly was released and a key witness in that 
and another high-profile scandal has disappeared.  Mutharika 
continues to highlight anti-corruption efforts as a 
centerpiece of his administration, and he appears to be 
beefing up the ACB to deliver convictions on politically 
sensitive cases.  End summary. 
 
 
---------------------- 
Invitation to a Firing 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) According to a well-placed source in the ACB, 
President Mutharika summoned Justice H. M. Mtegha, director 
of the ACB, to a meeting Friday, September 3.  There he 
offered him the position of deputy at the Malawian mission to 
the UN.  Mtegha declined the job, citing his wife\'s poor 
health.  Mutharika then offered him the post of high 
commissioner in Tanzania, which he also declined.  Perhaps 
beginning to understand the purpose of the meeting, Mtegha 
then expressed a desire to go back to the Malawian high 
court.  While Mtegha was still in the room, Mutharika then 
asked an aide to contact Gustave Kaliwo about Mtegha\'s job at 
ACB. 
 
3. (C) Mutharika offered no reason for replacing Mtegha, but 
more than one source, including one at the ACB, has told us 
Mtegha backed off from at least one politically sensitive 
case at the behest of then-President Bakili Muluzi.  The ACB 
source indicated that this was the most likely reason for 
Mtegha\'s sacking.  Generally, though, the ACB under Mtegha\'s 
leadership had a reputation as the most aggressive player--or 
at least not the bottleneck--in fighting corruption. 
 
4. (U) Kaliwo, Mtegha\'s replacement, is coming to the job 
from private practice, where he has prosecuted several cases 
on behalf of ACB, and from a previous career as the first 
lawyer appointed to Malawi\'s police force.  He appears to fit 
the mold of other Mutharika appointments in being 
technocratic: technically competent and without compelling 
political connections.  The appointment may increase the 
independence of the already relatively independent ACB. 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Divining Intentions: It\'s All in the Timing 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The timing of the change is interesting in itself. 
The ACB is preparing several already public cases involving 
former ministers of the Muluzi regime (see reftel).  A week 
ago, the government released its official report on the 2002 
\"maize scam,\" in which former finance minister Friday Jumbe 
is accused of selling subsidized maize at a profit during a 
famine, with the knowledge of Muluzi.  Peter Mulamba, a key 
witness in that and another high-profile case, has recently 
gone missing and is feared to be dead.  The chairman of the 
commission investigating the scandal has reportedly received 
death threats and has had one person arrested for threatening 
him in person.  The Mulamba disappearance has distracted 
Parliament\'s budget session as members have demanded an 
official investigation. 
 
6. (U) Meanwhile, Mutharika is continuing to build popular 
support for his government on two issues: fiscal 
responsibility and control of corruption.  In his budget 
speech on August 30, Mutharika promised \"action, action, and 
more action\" in fighting corruption.  His newly appointed 
director of public prosecutions, Ishmael Wadi, has been 
grabbing headlines by naming the targets of investigations 
and pending prosecutions.  Several senior UDF officials have 
been arrested for corruption and other crimes.  In essence, 
Mutharika appears to be building momentum--and pressure--for 
his government to convict senior officials of the Muluzi 
administration. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Comment: Does It All Add Up? 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (C) To all appearances, replacing the ACB director is 
another step in building an independent, technically 
competent team to prosecute politically sensitive corruption 
cases.  The ACB has told us privately that it intends to go 
after the former chief of state.  But Mutharika owes his 
presidency to Muluzi, and it is Muluzi who cobbled together 
Mutharika\'s governing coalition.  Added to which, Muluzi 
seems strangely untroubled about the threats being made 
against him and his cronies (though the same cannot be said 
for the cronies, who are protesting vigorously in the press). 
 Most international observers, and many Malawians, are 
remaining cautious for the time being; they are unlikely to 
celebrate the beginning of the end of corruption before the 
Mutharika administration delivers its first important 
conviction.

1. (C) SUMMARY.  A UNHCR team from Geneva has assembled in 
Malawi to verify the number of refugees and asylum seekers in 
the two camps and in urban areas. Serious problems with the 
2003 census and doubts about UNHCR Malawi\'s management of the 
refugee situation prompted World Food Program (WFP) to 
request Geneva\'s assistance in determining the actual 
population and number of food beneficiaries in Malawi. 
Though initially marred by technical difficulties, the 
exercise is being conducted in an efficient manner and is, 
thus far, reducing the possibility for fraud and 
misrepresentation in the camps. New, sophisticated refugee 
identification and ration cards are being distributed, and 
though a formal exit monitoring system is not yet in place, 
the new cards provide previously non-existent identification 
and accountability controls. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
UNCLEAR POPULATION FIGURES 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) During September 8 visit to Dzaleka refugee camp, WFP 
officials told poloff they requested a verification of the 
refugee and asylum seeker population directly from Geneva. 
WFP officials observed that the camp was essentially empty 
until food day, and asked UNHCR Malawi to provide updated 
population figures.  UNHCR Malawi was unable to do so, and 
according to WFP, the resident UNHCR mission in Malawi was 
\"unhelpful\" and \"resistant\" to the idea of a verification 
exercise, so WFP \"went around\" the local office and straight 
to Geneva.  (NOTE: Asylum seeker is defined as a person who 
has not been designated by the GOM as a refugee - the GOM has 
only one officer to adjudicate these cases and works with a 
substantial case backlog.  END NOTE.)  WFP has long suspected 
that poor management of the refugee caseload has contributed 
to misrepresentation and incorrect assessments of the 
population eligible to receive food assistance in the camps. 
Verification will also take place in Luwani camp and in urban 
areas, though refugees living outside of the camps are not 
entitled to WFP rations. 
 
3.  (C) The head of the UNHCR delegation from Geneva admitted 
that the 2003 census (reftel A) was badly flawed, and that 
the lack of a departure monitoring mechanism combined with 
the generic ration cards presented an easy opportunity for 
fraud.  WFP officials have repeatedly told poloff they have 
serious concerns with UNHCR\'s management of the camp 
population.  Incidences of Malawians posing as refugees or 
refugees using the ration cards of dead or long-departed 
refugees are, according to WFP, very common.  UNHCR 
population figures continually disagreed with WFP figures, 
and even after the 2003 census, UNHCR maintained there were 
many more refugees than were counted (reftel B). 
 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES 
---------------------- 
 
4.  (C) The UNHCR team arrived in Malawi on August 23 with 
the goal of verifying 100 families each day.  As of September 
8, fewer than 200 families had been verified, though the 
daily figures have steadily risen.  The first two weeks of 
the exercise were lost to computer and equipment problems. 
WFP\'s position is that these problems could have been easily 
prevented with prior communication and adequate preparation 
on the part of UNHCR Malawi, whom they felt was behaving in 
an \"obstructionist\" manner. The UNHCR official from Geneva 
agreed that preparation was inadequate. 
 
5.  (U)  The verification process is complex and heavily 
dependent on technology. Much of the process is based on a 
May 2004 exercise carried out by an NGO to identify and 
assign street addresses to each home in the camp.  Each 
individual or family must come to the verification center 
with all of his/her identification documents, ration card, 
and street address.  The existing ration card database is 
cross-checked against the residential database, and family 
size is physically verified. All of this information is then 
entered into a new database. 
 
21ST CENTURY ID CARDS 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (U) New refugee/asylum seeker identification cards are 
printed after the legitimacy of each claim to such status, 
identity, and family size are verified.  The cards include a 
digital photo of the bearer, the ration card number, and a 
case number, and are laminated with a UNHCR holographic logo. 
To receive food rations, an adult member of the family must 
present the ration card and his/her photo ID.  A \"food list\" 
will be maintained to document who has received rations each 
month, and after three consecutive no-shows, the refugee will 
be presumed to have departed the camp and all benefits will 
be suspended.  The database will then be updated accordingly. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C)  The verification exercise is long overdue.  The 
admittedly flawed census and UNHCR Malawi\'s unsubstantiated 
claims of a higher population have been a source of 
controversy and concern for us and, apparently, for WFP. 
Though not entirely infallible, the new ID cards and 
management system will provide better data and reduce 
opportunities for misrepresentation. Because the authority 
for printing both the ID cards and the ration cards will 
ultimately rest with UNHCR Malawi, further uncertainties are 
not out of the question. WFP\'s obvious distrust of UNHCR 
Malawi corroborates our suspicions of poor local leadership 
and further emphasizes the need for continued oversight of 
the Malawi portfolio.  Along with WFP, we will be on the 
lookout for a significant change in population demographics 
or in the number of daily verifications performed after the 
departure of the UNHCR team.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1. (C) Ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) MP Austin Muluzi, 
son of former President Bakili Muluzi, spoke freely about the 
UDF\'s displeasure with President Bingu wa Mutharika at a 
September 15 lunch with poloff.  According to Austin, UDF MPs 
plan to feign support for Mutharika\'s budget at a September 
15 party caucus with Mutharika and then to vote against it 
the following week.  Describing the President and his 
administration as politically unsavvy, Austin explained that 
the President had been blatantly ignoring the UDF because 
Mutharika felt, until recently, he had the opposition\'s full 
support.  Turning to former President Muluzi\'s recent 
grassroots rallies, Austin said Muluzi wanted to ensure he 
had popular support in case Mutharika tries to bring Muluzi 
up on corruption charges, which both son and father were 
convinced would happen in the near future.  Austin reported 
that Muluzi had made a gentlemen\'s agreement with Mutharika 
that Mutharika could prosecute members of the former 
administration, as long as Muluzi was left out of it.  New to 
Malawian politics, Austin has a rather dramatic 
interpretation of current political discourse, but he is in 
all of the right conversations with all of the right people. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
TAKING THE BUDGET TO THE FLOOR 
------------------------------ 
2. (C) At a September 15 lunch with poloff, United Democratic 
Front (UDF) MP Austin Muluzi, son of former President Bakili 
Muluzi, said the current budget session of Parliament would 
finish on September 24, one week longer than expected 
(reftel).  During the session, Austin said the Mutharika 
administration would have trouble passing its budget because 
UDF MPs planned to vote against it in protest of the 
President\'s lack of support for the party.  According to 
Austin, UDF MPs planned to feign support for the budget at a 
September 15 party caucus with the President in order to 
preempt any suspicions the President may have. 
 
DISPLEASURE IN THE UDF: \"TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE\" 
--------------------------------------------- - 
3. (C) Characterizing the vote against the budget as a form 
of protest, Austin said that many MPs in the UDF are 
discontented by Mutharika\'s lack of support for the party, 
willingness to try the party faithful for alleged corruption, 
and unilateral decisions without consulting the party.  It is 
only recently, according to Austin, that Mutharika has 
attended party rallies, and only under intense pressure from 
party members and decreasing support from the opposition. 
Austin also described the party\'s growing disdain with 
several of Mutharika\'s \"loud\" appointments, like Director of 
Public Prosecutions Ishmael Wadi and Chief of Staff Ken 
Ng\'oma, who consistently lambaste Muluzi and the UDF.  Austin 
said Mutharika recently realized that his support in the 
opposition was waning and that he needed to improve relations 
with the UDF.  The feeling amongst party members, Austin 
said, is that Mutharika has done \"too little, too late\" for 
the party. 
 
COURTING OPPOSITION SUPPORT 
--------------------------- 
4. (C) Summarizing Mutharika\'s political strategy, Austin 
said Mutharika believed he could garner support from the 
opposition ranks by implementing their initiatives and 
rebuffing the UDF.  Austin cited budgets items such as the 
mausoleum for former President-for-Life Dr. Kamuzu Banda as 
evidence of Mutharika\'s alliance with the opposition Malawi 
Congress Party (MCP), which controls the most seats in 
Parliament.  This strategy worked for a while, Austin 
surmised, until opposition leadership began feeling that 
Mutharika was stealing their reform initiatives and taking 
all the credit.  Only with support waning in the opposition 
did Mutharika return to the UDF.  Mutharika has, however, 
continued his attempts to build his central region support by 
reverting the names of Lilongwe International Airport, 
Lilongwe Central Hospital, and Chichiri Stadium to their 
pre-multi-party democracy names of \"Kamuzu Banda,\" a move 
which has been trumpeted by the MCP. 
 
ADVISING MUTHARIKA 
------------------ 
5. (C) According to Austin, Mutharika has three principal 
advisors: Chief of Staff Ken Ng\'oma, Chief Secretary for the 
Public Service Charles Matabwa, and his Chief Security 
Advisor (no name given).  Foremost in the next tier of 
advisors is Secretary to the President and Cabinet Bright 
Msaka.  Austin, however, said Msaka, a distant relation of 
Muluzi\'s, was \"on Muluzi\'s team,\" and Mutharika only trusted 
him to a point.  Austin also said Minister of Finance Goodall 
Gondwe, an old friend of Mutharika\'s, was really more in the 
Muluzi camp than the Mutharika one and that Gondwe was 
becoming \"very frustrated\" with Mutharika\'s unilateral style 
of management.  (COMMENT:  Very politically savvy, Gondwe was 
Muluzi\'s Economic Advisor during the second Muluzi 
administration.  He maintains close relations with both 
Muluzi and Mutharika.  END COMMENT.) 
 
MULUZI: TAKING CARE OF HIMSELF 
------------------------------ 
6. (C) Confirming Muluzi\'s drive for a third term was born in 
fear of what would happen after he left office, Austin said 
his father had a gentlemen\'s agreement with Mutharika that 
Mutharika could prosecute anyone from the previous 
administration for corruption, as long as Muluzi was left out 
of it.  Austin specifically cited former Minister of Finance 
Friday Jumbe as a potential target.  Austin said that 
contrary to the agreement, reliable information has reached 
both him and his father that Mutharika is now speaking about 
\"when Muluzi is arrested,\" not \"if.\" 
 
7. (C) In an attempt to keep the party together and to 
maintain his own popular support, Muluzi has started holding 
more political rallies at the grassroots.  Austin said Muluzi 
feels his only remaining strategy against a potential arrest 
for corruption is if he \"has the people on his side.\" 
According to all indications, Muluzi remains very popular in 
the villages, while the educated urbanites would support his 
prosecution. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8. (C) Politically immature, Austin has a dramatic 
interpretation of current political debate;  that said, he is 
at the center of all major UDF discussions.  While there may 
be growing displeasure with Mutharika in the UDF and 
Mutharika may be losing opposition support, voting the budget 
down would be an unprecedented (and unlikely) vote of no 
confidence by Parliament.  Austin clearly sees ruling party 
and opposition support as a zero-sum game.  Mutharika, on the 
other hand, has a more nuanced understanding and realizes 
that the UDF is no longer the voting block it once was and 
may only be a source of some support. 
 
9. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  We have no trouble believing that 
Muluzi is willing to let others take the fall in order to 
save himself.  While Muluzi\'s former cronies will likely try 
to implicate him as well, Muluzi knows that support from the 
presidency would likely be enough to shield him from 
prosecution.  Yet, Mutharika has given no indication that 
that support will be forthcoming.  END COMMENT.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) The World Bank vice president for Africa recently 
briefed donors in Lilongwe, confirming that the Bank was 
disbursing $25 million in order to support the new 
government\'s fiscal reform agenda and to avoid a currency 
crisis.  He reported that the GOM is looking to raise the bar 
on economic performance and that the Bank is emphasizing the 
need to improve the investment climate.  Both the Bank and 
donors continue to express cautious support for Mutharika\'s 
fiscal agenda, stressing that it depends on continued 
performance. 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
WORLD BANK TO MALAWI: KEEP GOING 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) At a briefing for donor chiefs of mission in 
Lilongwe on September 13, World Bank vice president for 
Africa Callisto Madavo gave his perspective on a round of 
meetings with GOM officials centered on the disbursement of 
the first half of a $50 million structural adjustment credit. 
  He confirmed that the Bank took early action for two 
reasons: to give an encouraging signal to the reformist 
government of President Bingu wa Mutharika, and to provide 
balance of payment support before seasonal foreign exchange 
pressure produces a currency crisis (see reftel).  After 
acknowledging Mutharika\'s progress in imposing fiscal 
discipline and prosecuting corruption, Madavo made it clear 
that the Bank will release the second tranche only if its 
established triggers are hit. 
 
3. (U) Madavo portrayed the Bank as being concerned in the 
medium term about accelerating growth from the current 4 
percent to 6, the level targeted for long-term poverty 
reduction.  The Bank sees two main priorities: increase in 
agricultural productivity (suffering from years of 
malpractice and neglect) and creation of a 
confidence-inspiring climate for new investment.  Madavo 
stressed that enabling private-sector growth is the only 
alternative to continued dependence and poverty.  The Bank 
hopes to reorient thinking about the economy from poverty 
reduction to wealth creation. 
 
4. (U) According to Madavo, in his meetings with Minister of 
Finance Goodall Gondwe he heard an interest in \"raising the 
level of ambition,\" to get beyond the current crisis and make 
Malawi a performer in the region.  Gondwe has said the 
country should be well positioned to do this without dramatic 
funding increases, because program implementation has plenty 
of room for improvement.  Gondwe is reported to have asked 
Madavo to carry a message to donors to allow him \"space to 
operate\"--meaning some latitude and time to consider 
different policy options and directions. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
DONORS: CAN OPTIMISM BE REALISTIC? 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The donor reaction to Madavo\'s presentation was 
positive, but several representatives took pains to register 
continued concern about budgetary discipline.  One donor 
expressed particular concern about promised fertilizer 
subsidies; accounts of the subsidy program have ranged from a 
highly targeted subsidy to a general price reduction subsidy. 
 (NOTE: In a subsequent conversation, Gondwe said opposition 
MPs are pressing for a general subsidy; he reported that he 
is demanding a zero-sum approach to the budget, and that MPs 
are reluctant to propose realistic trade-offs.  The public 
confusion about what subsidy is actually in the budget can be 
explained by the fact that the political battle is still in 
progress.  End Note.)  Other donors noted that the signals 
from the Mutharika government are not perfectly clear, and 
that there is plenty of precedent for fiscal recidivism. 
These expressions of skepticism notwithstanding, the donors 
are following the Bank\'s lead in opening their purses: Norway 
is considering release of a $3 million tranche of budget 
support, and the UK intends to release nearly $9 million 
during Mutharika\'s September visit to London, with another 
$18 million by the end of the calendar year. 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
COMMENT: STAYING SOBER AIN\'T EASY 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Madavo\'s message, as represented to the donors, is 
dead right.  We were encouraged to hear the practical 
reasoning for the September disbursement, and agree that any 
congratulations must be accompanied by the reminder that we 
are still watching.  One benefit of an early Bank disbursal 
is that it allows everyone to see how this government behaves 
when it is relatively flush, especially given the presence of 
an IMF staff monitoring program.  The more seasoned members 
of the donor community here are the most skeptical, having 
heard more or less the same promises many times before. 
However strong the public support for responsible governance, 
there is constant political pressure to return to old 
spending habits, based on widespread ignorance of--or 
disregard for--clear economic imperatives.  (Though 
considering the donors\' forgiving behavior in the past, the 
reality of economic imperatives here may not be so clear.) 
 
7. (SBU) Gondwe\'s recent budget address to Parliament 
stressed the need for a series of transitional budgets to put 
the house back in order, followed by more ambitious 
developmental budgets once investment money becomes 
available.  One hopes that Parliament will have enough 
patience, and the administration enough discipline, to avoid 
the lapse that so many here seem to expect.  This much is 
certain: sound but dull fiscal policy does not have the 
popular appeal of reckless handouts, and seeing it through 
will involve real political risk.  It is up to the donors to 
make it clear that breaking discipline will carry its own 
risks.

1. (SBU) Since the May 2004 presidential and parliamentary 
elections, the landscape of opposition politics has changed. 
Political parties and national politics remain focused on 
individuals, but many of those individuals now have their own 
parties.  While not necessarily breaking down the strong 
regionalism that exists in Malawian politics, the 
representation of several parties in Parliament creates a 
much less stable working majority in the House.  With 
President Mutharika\'s support waning in his own United 
Democratic Front (UDF), balancing opposition and ruling party 
politics is becoming more difficult, as evidenced by the 
current budget debate (reftel G).  The following details the 
alliances of principle opposition figures. 
 
John Tembo: President of the Malawi Congress Party 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
2. (SBU) Winning the second most votes in the 2004 
presidential elections with twenty-seven percent of the 
popular vote, Malawi Congress Party (MCP) President John 
Tembo is Leader of Opposition in Parliament, and since the 
elections he has settled comfortably into that role.  The 
MCP, with more seats in the House than any other political 
party, is also the most stable voting block.  Tembo and the 
MCP have supported the Mutharika administration on some 
initiatives, such as some of the President\'s controversial 
appointments, but they have also been a meaningful opposition 
to important government issues, such as the budget.  At 
present, Tembo is the party president with the most control 
over his party, and the MCP is the most unified party. 
 
Gwanda Chakuamba: President of the Republican Party 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
3. (SBU) After coming in third in the presidential elections 
and mounting a brief legal challenge to Mutharika\'s win, 
Gwanda Chakuamba and his Republican Party (RP) formed an 
alliance with the UDF (reftel B).  Chakuamba, who promised he 
would retire from politics if he did not win as the 
Mgwirizano Coalition\'s presidential candidate and who does 
not have a seat in the House, has thus far kept his word. 
The media generally speculate that Chakuamba was willing to 
ally his party with the UDF and drop the court case because 
the GOM agreed to pay Chakuamba an outstanding settlement 
from his imprisonment under the Banda regime.  Newly 
appointed Attorney General Ralph Kasambara announced recently 
that the GOM plans to appeal the court\'s decision to award 
Chakuamba MK 56 million (USD 520,000) in restitution.  If 
government pursues the appeal, RP, which is the largest party 
after the UDF in the UDF\'s working majority, will likely 
return to the opposition ranks of the House. 
 
Chakufwa Chihana: President of the Alliance for Democracy 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
4. (SBU) For unilaterally deciding to back the UDF and 
Mutharika in the 2004 elections, Chakufwa Chihana has become 
largely unpopular in his former Northern Region stronghold, 
and his Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) party won less than a 
third of the parliamentary seats it had in 1999.  Chihana has 
recently made unsuccessful attempts to re-gain favor in the 
North and among AFORD break-away party Movement for Genuine 
Democracy (MGODE) MPs.  After his short stint as Second Vice 
President and Minister of Agriculture at the end of President 
Muluzi\'s second administration, Chihana, still Minister of 
Agriculture, is aging, and concern about his pension is the 
likely cause of his current faithfulness to the UDF. 
Chihana\'s fickle political nature and unilateral 
decision-making have decimated the usually very solid 
Northern Region voting block that AFORD once controlled. 
 
Sam Kandodo Banda: President of Movement for Genuine Democracy 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
5. (SBU) Sam Kandodo Banda, former AFORD heavyweight, led the 
internal AFORD faction displeased with Chihana\'s leadership 
to form the Movement for Genuine Democracy (MGODE).  More so 
than other parties, MGODE has focused on developing internal 
party structures, and it has gained some grassroots support 
in the North Region as the viable alternative to AFORD. 
Shortly after the elections, MGODE formed an alliance with 
the UDF and received a minor ministerial position (reftel C). 
 Kandodo Banda, though not a parliamentarian or minister, is 
recognized as the party\'s leader, and the party is poised to 
gain influence in the Northern Region. 
 
Aleke Banda: President of People\'s Progressive Movement 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
6. (SBU) Aleke Banda, former UDF stalwart and Minister in 
both of President Muluzi\'s administrations, became the de 
facto head of the Mgwirizano Coalition when Chakuamba left 
the coalition to support the UDF.  Banda, who had been the 
Coalition\'s vice presidential candidate, was elected the 
President of People\'s Progressive Movement (PPM) after he 
left the UDF (reftel D).  He and PPM remain strongly 
anti-UDF.  Reduced from its original strength of seven 
parties, the Mgwirizano Coalition currently comprises five 
parties and controls a handful of seats in Parliament. 
Taking the mantle from Chakuamba, Banda continues to pursue 
the legal challenge of the elections, though legal hurdles 
and questionable evidence have dogged the process. 
 
Brown Mpinganjira: Re-Joined the United Democratic Front 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
7. (SBU) The once right-hand man of former President Bakili 
Muluzi, Brown Mpinganjira, who in 2001 formed the aggressive 
anti-UDF opposition pressure group cum political party the 
National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has re-joined the UDF 
after garnering few votes in the 2004 presidential elections. 
 Disgruntled members of the NDA have tried to re-vitalize the 
opposition group, but the efforts have had little traction. 
Mpinganjira, seeing his political future better served in the 
UDF, no doubt eyes the party\'s presidential candidacy for 
2009, as many believe the UDF will not allow President 
Mutharika to contest for a second term.  (reftel A) 
 
Hetherwick Ntaba: President of New Congress for Democracy 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
8. (SBU) Former MCP heavyweight Hetherwick Ntaba, who created 
the New Congress for Democracy (NCD) party to stand as a 
presidential candidate, earned himself a ministerial position 
just before the elections for pulling out of the presidential 
race and supporting the UDF (reftel E).  In Mutharika\'s 
administration, Ntaba was appointed Minister of Health and is 
largely viewed as a UDF sellout.  He is contesting the 
election results in his constituency, where he was defeated 
by an MCP candidate. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9. (SBU) The UDF\'s working majority in Parliament is fragile, 
and it does not help that it was orchestrated by UDF chairman 
Bakili Muluzi, not President Mutharika (reftel F). 
Maintaining that working majority will largely depend on how 
the individuals listed above are treated by the UDF.  If 
Mutharika continues to neglect the necessary political 
housekeeping, he will either find himself without a working 
majority in Parliament or dependent on Muluzi to garner 
support from opposition leaders. 
 
10. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED.  National politics continue to 
focus on individuals, rather than ideologies.  And, while 
there are more political parties represented in Parliament, 
support for those parties remains largely along regional 
lines: the UDF in the Southern Region; the MCP in the Central 
Region; and AFORD, PPM, and MGODE in the Northern Region. 
END COMMENT.

REF: A. STATE 202651 (NOTAL) 
 
     B. LILONGWE 497 (NOTAL) 
 
1. Per reftel A request, post provides the following update 
on Global Fund activities in Malawi. 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
2. As the end of year two of Global Fund in Malawi 
approaches, the GOM will likely exceed anti-retroviral (ARV) 
treatment and voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) goals, 
but will fall short of meeting prevention of 
Mother-to-Child-Transmission (PMTCT) and care and support 
targets.  At present, over 8,000 individuals are enrolled in 
anti-retroviral therapy (ART) programs, and 312 clinical 
staff have been trained and certified as ARV providers.  By 
December 2004, ARVs are planned to be offered at 54 sites, 21 
of which are currently operational.  The Global Fund 
implementation process, which was stymied in bureaucracy six 
months ago, has been turned around by three principal 
factors: NGOs\' willingness to begin ARV programs, with their 
own funding, in expectation of receiving Global Fund money; 
design of an explicit operational plan; and improved 
coordination within the Ministry of Health.  Without the 
expectation of forthcoming Global Fund resources, the current 
expansion of HIV/AIDS treatment and care facilities in Malawi 
would be very unlikely.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE INITIAL LOAN: CURRENT STATUS OF PROGRAMS 
-------------------------------------------- 
3. With over 8,000 individuals enrolled in ARV programs, the 
GOM is on track to exceed its initial goal of providing ARVs 
to 10,000 individuals by the end of the Global Fund\'s second 
year in Malawi.  312 clinical staff have been trained and 
certified as ARV providers, and 21 ARV sites are operational. 
 Through co-opting NGO clinics already providing health care 
services and rapid preparation of key GOM facilities, such as 
the three central hospitals, 54 sites are slated to offer ART 
by year\'s end.  These recently published numbers suggest that 
the GOM will meet its original target of 25,000 individuals 
on ARVs after 5 years. 
 
4. The GOM is also set to exceed its VCT goal of having 
75,000 individuals tested by year\'s end.  Of the 118 VCT 
sites in country, over 100 of them have opened in the last 18 
months in anticipation of increased access to ARVs through 
Global Fund resources.  Many of the VCTs are also positioning 
themselves to be ARV providers.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) 
is currently assessing and certifying VCT sites.  Given the 
requirement for all ARV sites to provide VCT services, rapid 
VCT expansion is clearly a result of the general expectation 
that Global Fund resources will bring greater access to ARV 
programs. 
 
5. Less driven by the expectation of Global Fund resources, 
expansion of PMTCT and basic care and support services has 
been delayed, primarily due to the absence of a readily 
accessible network of providers.  Reaction to recent 
technical recommendations about Niverapine mono-therapy has 
also slowed PMTCT expansion. 
 
THE CREDITORS: NGOs WILLING TO INVEST 
------------------------------------- 
6. The recent expansion of ARV programs, VCT services, and 
other HIV/AIDS-related initiatives is principally a result of 
the expectation of forthcoming Global Fund resources, not 
Global Fund resources themselves.  NGOs (and to a lesser 
extent GOM agencies) have been willing to use their own funds 
to start ARV programs with the expectation that the programs 
will begin using Global Fund resources once available.  This 
pre-establishment of Global Fund-driven programs, NGOs 
anticipate, will allow for more rapid expansion of services. 
(NOTE: Most of the NGOs operating such programs have already 
been approved by the National AIDS Commission as Global Fund 
grant recipients. END NOTE.) 
HELPING WRITE THE CHECK: WHAT\'S DRIVING IMPLEMENTATION 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
7. In addition to NGOs\' willingness to act before receiving 
funding, strong leadership in creating an explicit 
operational plan and in improving coordination within the 
Ministry of Health (MOH) has helped remove technical hurdles 
and concentrate on action.  Two USAID/Malawi-funded technical 
advisors, one who works on ARV expansion planning and one who 
problem solves coordination efforts, have been key components 
to helping GOM agencies work with themselves and with the 
Global Fund bureaucracy.  National AIDS Commission (NAC) and 
MOH\'s perception that they could lose Phase II Global Fund 
resources if they do not perform well against their original 
goals has also helped speed implementation along.  If a Phase 
II grant is approved prematurely, the GOM\'s implementation 
momentum may lessen slightly. 
 
CHECKING THE BALANCE: GOOD INFORMATION SHARING 
--------------------------------------------- - 
8. The HIV/AIDS Unit of the Ministry of Health is the lead on 
information collection and progress tracking for clinical 
elements of the Global Fund program.  The Unit has 
established its own data collection system, and, to date, has 
been able and willing to provide up-to-date data on progress 
against clinical service goals.  NAC has also launched a 
national monitoring and evaluation system to track all 
HIV/AIDS activities in Malawi, regardless of funding source. 
Information that NAC collects, though sometimes limited by 
fragile data bases and voluntary reporting, is willingly and 
regularly shared.  In addition, NAC quarterly publishes and 
distributes Global Fund expenditure data.  Mechanisms for 
tracking other outputs attributable to Global Fund have been 
unclear. 
 
POTENTIAL DEBITS: CHALLENGES FOR YEAR THREE 
------------------------------------------- 
9. Potential challenges as Malawi enters its third year of 
engagement with Global Fund are as follow: 
 
-- Delays in Drug Procurement: Global Fund and UNICEF 
(contracted by NAC to procure and distribute drugs and 
clinical supplies) have averaged ten weeks from order 
placement to supply arrival.  If ARV sites have unanticipated 
increases in patients, adequate drug provision could be 
delayed for three to five months. 
 
-- Adequate Oversight: With rapid ARV program expansion 
planned as soon as Global Fund resources are available, there 
is question as to whether the MOH and NAC will be able to 
provide adequate supervision and quality control. 
 
-- Loss of Momentum: In the face of dramatic patient 
increases and greater demands on health care facilities, 
momentum to expand ARV services may wane before Global Fund 
goals are reached. 
 
-- Stigma and Loss of Focus on Prevention: Stigmatization of 
HIV/AIDS infected individuals and a loss of focus on 
prevention also remain concerns. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
10. Since the January 2004 release of the second tranche of 
funding, the GOM has made genuine and tangible efforts to 
facilitate rapid, effective utilization of funding and to 
avoid leaving resources idle.  Moreover, there is no evidence 
that funds have been diverted for other purposes.  While 
Global Fund resources in and of themselves have not resulted 
in many of the recent HIV/AIDS treatment initiatives in 
Malawi, it is clear that if the funding was not anticipated, 
those expansions would not be taking place.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: SITREP 30: GOVERNMENT TAKES STEPS 
TO ADDRESS HUMANITARIAN FOOD NEEDS IN MALAWI 
 
 
1.SUMMARY: A key GOM-donor meeting, chaired by the 
President of Malawi, was held on Saturday September 
18th. Although the GOM will likely not declare a disaster 
this year, an urgent appeal was made for humanitarian 
assistance for the WFP program. The GOM re-established 
the government-led \"Joint Task Force\" coordination 
mechanism that was employed so successfully during the 
2002 food crisis. The GOM also reiterated its commitment 
to purchase and import 70,000 tons of maize from 
neighboring countries despite indications that the 
private sector has the capacity to handle commercial 
imports. The GOM is planning to provide free and/or 
subsidized fertilizer and seeds to most farmers, but the 
details have yet to be worked out. Private sector input 
dealers are concerned that delays in defining the scope 
and operation of the government scheme could impair the 
country\'s ability to be ready for the upcoming planting 
season. Despite this new leadership, the World Food 
Program emergency operations for the January-April 2005 
period remain under-resourced. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
2.The President of Malawi Bingu wa Mutharika called an 
emergency meeting to discuss growing humanitarian food 
needs in Malawi and to map out the way forward in 
the months to come. This meeting follows rising donor 
concerns about lack of GOM leadership on the growing 
humanitarian food needs this year. The meeting was 
well attended by Government Ministers, Donors and senior 
government staff. 
 
3.The president explained the meeting was part of a 
consultative effort between GOM and its development 
partners. The president said the country is facing a 
food shortfall and made an urgent appeal to donors for 
humanitarian food assistance for the coming lean months 
(October, 2004 to April, 2005). A state of emergency was 
not declared. The GOM stated that it believes the 
country\'s humanitarian food needs can be met without such 
a declaration. 
 
4.At the meeting, the President of Malawi announced the 
revival of the Food Security Joint Task Force to 
coordinate humanitarian food needs this coming season. 
The Joint Task Force ensured enhanced coordination 
between GOM, donors, civic society and NGOs during the 
last food crisis in 2001/02 and is credited with improved 
humanitarian response that averted hunger during the food 
crisis. 
 
5.The President of Malawi will personally chair the Joint 
Task Force meetings in order to issue the attention it 
deserves. In addition, the humanitarian food needs 
subcommittee of the Joint Task Force has been revived. 
 
6.Donor welcomes the leadership, efforts but observed 
that, without declaration of state of emergency, some 
donors may not be able to mobilize humanitarian food 
resources. 
 
MALAWI HUMANITARIAN FOOD NEEDS 
 
7.According to calculations by FAO/WFP Crop and Food 
Suppply Assessment Mission (CFSAM), there is a possible 
deficit of 600,000 MT. If the contributions from 
cassava and sweetpotatoes are factored in, the food 
deficit decreases to 408,000 MT. This will be met through 
a combination of commercial imports (formal and informal) 
from neighbouring countries principally Zambia and 
Mozambique and humanitarian food assistance. 
 
8.Maize imports are primarily by either private sector 
importers responding to market opportunities and GOM 
interventions in the commercial maize sector. Informal 
private sector maize traders play a significant role 
in maize imports as recent monitoring by USAID-supported 
FEWSNET has revealed. 
 
9.In the month of August alone, close to 13,000 MT of 
maize moved into Malawi by informal traders, largely on 
bicycles and small trucks. Imports will likely increase 
as demand increases in the coming months (Note: These 
import numbers sharply contrast the earlier 2,000 MT per 
month estimate, GOM officials that are often too quick to 
dismiss the significant role private traders play in 
maize imports.) 
 
10.Using the most likely scenario for Malawi by the 
Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC), 
humanitarian food assistance news are pegged at 86,000 MT 
for some 1.6 million people especially in the southern 
part of the country. 
 
11.Humanitarian food assistance is likely to be met 
through food aid programs managed by WFP and heavily 
supported by the USG. The WFP/Malawi emergency food 
program for the upcoming hungry season remains severely 
under resourced.  WFP does not have enough food to 
maintain food aid deliveries during the critical January- 
March 2005 period. WFP indicates it needs 41,000 MT 
between January and March 2005. WFP has made an urgent 
appeal to donors (including USAID) for immediate 
assistance. 
 
12.While the situation in Malawi is not yet a crisis, 
there is a clear food aid need this season. Post has 
requested USAID/Washington commit further resources to 
the WFP/Malawi program from FY 2005 budget resources. 
Post strongly urges FFP to consider a total food 
allocation to WFP/Malawi of 30,000 tons during the 
October 2004 to March 2005 period given the food 
situation on the ground. Sorghum would be more 
appropriate than maize this year in Malawi. 
 
STRATEGIC GRAIN RESERVE TO BE FILLED BY OCTOBER 
 
13.The Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) is set to be 
replenished to the agreed level of 60,000 MT by October. 
Of this 28,000 MT is a contribution from the EU while GOM 
will replenish 32,000 MT it \"borrowed\" from the SGR last 
season. Tenders went out and deliveries have started. So 
far, 10,000 MT has been received by National Food Reserve 
Agency, NFRA. GOM says 60,000 MT of maize will be in by 
end October, 2004. 
 
14.In light of the anticipated WFP/Malawi pipeline break 
in October, GOM and the donors have agreed that WFP can 
access the SGR maize now, with replenishment later in the 
season. According to established SGR rules, the SGR 
cannot release SGR maize without donor or GOM pledges of 
replenishment later. So far, DFID and EU have pledged 
resources to replenish the SGR should WFP use SGR maize. 
The technical details of this arrangement are yet to be 
worked out. 
 
GOM TO IMPORT 70,000 MT COMMERCIAL MAIZE 
 
15.GOM is going ahead with the importation of 70,000 MT 
commercial maize for sale during the lean period despite 
donors concerns about the importation. GOM has budgeted 
MK 1.5 billion (13.8 million USD) for the exercise and 
the maize will be sourced locally and from neighbouring 
countries of Zambia and Mozambique. 
 
16.Donor concerns are three fold:(1) this decision will 
put pressure on GOM budget; (2) depending on price, it 
may disrupt the private sector maize trade, concentrate 
in meeting humanitarian needs and (3) subsidized maize 
may be diverted by local elites, especially if ADMARC, 
the government parastatal, is used to distribute 
subsidized maize to the population. 
 
17.GOM maintains that the 70,000 MT commercial maize is a 
contigency in case of private sector failure to supply 
maize at a critical time. At the September 18 meeting GOM 
commited to only intervening in the maize market in case 
of commercial maize shortage during the lean months and 
GOM has given the donors commitment that it will sell the 
maize to recover costs (e.g. no subsidy). 
 
18.Much mistrust exists between GOM and private sector 
maize trade. The private sector is uncertain as to 
government intentions while the GOM is unsure of the 
capacity of the private sector to meet maize shortfalls. 
 
19.Recently,USAID/Malawi,with valuable assistance from 
the REDSO-funded \"RATES\" activity, convened a meeting 
between GOM officials and private sector maize players to 
foster dialogue and communication between the GOM and 
private sector. The meeting went well and the two sides 
have agreed to meet again. Mission hopes this marks the 
beginning of a real dialogue between the GOM and private 
sector.

SUBJECT: MALAWI\'S BUDGET APPROVED 
 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified--not for Internet

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) Malawi\'s Parliament approved the FY 2004/05 budget on 
September 24.  During the course of deliberations, Parliament 
added MK4.2 billion ($39 million) of additional spending, 
principally for HIV/AIDS programs.  The deficit would remain 
at about MK8.5 billion ($79 million), or 4.3 percent of GDP, 
on a budget of MK89.9 billion ($840 million).  A number of 
likely expenditures are not included in the budget, though 
these may be balanced by expected but as yet unbudgeted donor 
revenues.  If the budget holds as written, Malawi will stay 
within the IMF\'s deficit ceiling, enabling a new IMF program 
and linked bilateral aid. The GOM will need both both 
discipline and luck to get through the November-March 
planting season.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
MAIN OBJECTIVE: TRANSITION TO STABILITY 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In his address to Parliament at the beginning of the 
budget session, Finance Minister Goodal Gondwe described the 
2004/05 budget as \"transitional,\" on account of the huge debt 
inherited from the profligate spending of former president 
Bakili Muluzi.  This recurrent expenditure will keep the 
government from investing enough to drive economic growth. 
Government\'s main ambition for this year, Gondwe said, is to 
establish the practices and mindset necessary to effective 
fiscal discipline and good economic governance.  The goal of 
this budget, then, is to achieve a track record.  That will 
lay the groundwork both for macroeconomic stability (helped 
by renewed aid flows) and for the fiscal soundness needed for 
development investment in future years. 
 
3. (U) As presented to Parliament, Gondwe\'s budget would 
spend MK85.7 billion ($801 million), or about 40 percent of 
GDP, against revenues of MK77.2 billion ($721 million).  On 
the revenue side, MK52 billion is domestic revenue and MK25 
billion is foreign aid/grants.  The deficit of MK8.5 billion 
($79 million) would stay just at the International Monetary 
Fund\'s (IMF) deficit ceiling of 4.3 percent of GDP. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
PARLIAMENT EXTENDS DEBATE, ADDS SPENDING FOR AIDS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (U) Parliament was reportedly far more engaged in debating 
this budget than in any previous year, adding an extra week 
to the normal two-week debate period.  This is thanks in part 
to a budget seminar for members of Parliament just prior to 
the session, and in part to the central place the Mutharika 
administration has given to fiscal matters.  The largest bone 
of contention appeared to be whether the GOM should assume 
donor revenues, which have been withheld for nonperformance 
in previous years.  At the end of the session, though, the 
budget stands substantially as drafted.  The largest 
allocations go to the ministries of education (MK10.6 
billion), health (MK9.1 billion), and agriculture (MK7 
billion).  Parliament added MK4.1 billion to the National 
AIDS Commission budget, which will be offset by a Global Fund 
grant. 
 
5. (SBU) Though the donor community is not enthusiastic about 
the size of the deficit, it is mostly satisfied with the 
reality of the budget.  Gondwe\'s budget includes all but a 
few predictable expenditures--a distinct improvement on the 
previous administration\'s notoriously unrealistic budgeting. 
The budget includes allocations for fertilizer subsidies and 
grain buys, which have traditionally been treated as 
off-budget emergency expenditures.  But the GOM is likely to 
make a few off-budget expenditures, including an MK800 
million rural microfinance facility, expenses for 
consolidating the government in Lilongwe, refurbishment of 
the chief of state\'s residence, and a civil service wage 
reform package. On the other hand, the budget makes 
conservative assumptions on interest rates (and thus on debt 
service expenditures) and deliberately leaves off several 
likely revenue sources which are politically contentious, 
such as higher effective tax rates on reformed government 
wages. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
COMMENT: LUCK STILL HAS A PART IN THIS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) While the final document has not been published, it 
appears that the budget is in line with the draft, which was 
vetted through the IMF\'s staff monitoring program.  The big 
challenge for the Mutharika administration is to stay within 
the budgetary limits.  We have a couple of reasons to think 
Mutharika may succeed at this. 
 
7. (SBU) First, the budget does not appear to be designed to 
please donors.  There are some hard-to-swallow expenditures, 
but we view them as a crucial concession to reality.  The 
budget avoids most revenue risk and thus has some implicit 
upside.  For instance, the possibility of new IMF aid 
represents a substantial windfall that would allow 
accelerated domestic debt retirement and a corresponding cut 
in debt service.  Second, Mutharika has positioned fiscal 
responsibility and economic growth firmly at the front of his 
administration\'s ambitions.  He has emphasized this issue 
almost to the exclusion of all others, making it virtually 
impossible for him to push the issue aside in case of failure 
to perform, as his predecessor did time after time. 
 
8. (SBU) But there is still risk in the coming months.  The 
GOM has to survive the November-March planting season, when 
inflation will rise because of food shortages, and foreign 
exchange pressure will increase.  With slim forex reserves 
and excess liquidity in the system, a currency devaluation 
and an inflationary spiral are still very real possibilities. 
 To survive the next six months, the government will have to 
be competent, disciplined, and lucky.

DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: USAID celebrated 44 years of partnership 
with the people of Malawi in a day-long event on 
October 20 at the USAID Mission in Lilongwe.  Nearly 
600 invited guests toured booths representing 33 
different projects under USAID\'s four strategic 
objectives: health, democracy and governance, 
education, and sustainable economic growth.  In his 
first appearance at a bilateral event in Malawi since 
assuming office, President Bingu wa Mutharika thanked 
the USG for its investment in Malawi since 1960.  He 
frankly stated his disappointment that Malawi did not 
qualify to participate in the Millennium Challenge 
Account (MCA), acknowledging \"shortcomings in our 
fiscal and financial management.\"  Mutharika expressed 
hope, however, that his policies of combating 
corruption and improving accountability would make 
Malawi more competitive for MCA consideration in the 
future.  Coverage of the USAID Anniversary in Malawi\'s 
national media was widespread, detailed and positive. 
The coverage focused primarily on USAID\'s current 
programs and on the long-term success of USAID\'s 
activities in Malawi--an investment totaling nearly USD 
two billion in current dollar terms.

President Mutharika thanked the United States for its 
long-term commitment to reduce poverty and foster 
democratic stability in Malawi.  Mutharika reiterated 
his commitment to combat corruption, reform the public 
sector and spur economic growth.  While noting 
disappointment that Malawi did not make the cut as a 
\"threshold country\" under the MCA, Mutharika urged the 
USG to favorably consider his good governance efforts 
in any future determination.  President Mutharika 
commented that Malawi would need to maintain 6 percent 
annual growth rates in order to substantially lower 
poverty rates.  Focusing on the importance of 
stimulating private-sector investment in order to 
promote economic growth, Mutharika promised 
\"fundamental policy reforms\" to reduce government 
interference in the private sector and requested 
continued donor support for anticorruption and poverty 
reduction efforts. 
 
3.  In his welcoming address, USAID Mission Director 
Roger Yochelson listed some of USAID\'s many 
achievements in Malawi, and praised Malawians for their 
energetic and sustained efforts as development 
partners.  He underscored that while the people of the 
United States remain life-long partners, in the end it 
is only Malawians who can ensure sustainable 
improvements to their country.  Looking to the future, 
the Mission Director called for greater effort in 
encouraging private-sector development as an engine for 
growth and development.  Charg d\'Affaires Gilmour 
emphasized the continued long-term benefits of USAID 
development programs in Malawi.  He mentioned specific 
benefits to Malawian citizens from USAID programs in 
education and human resource development, rural water 
development, HIV/AIDs awareness and testing, basic 
infrastructure projects like road construction, 
microcredit institutions and programs to educate the 
populace about their legal and constitutional rights. 
The Charg confirmed the USG\'s long-term commitment to 
Malawi, saying it is U.S. policy to invest in countries 
\"that care for the health and education of their 
people, respect freedom and the rule of law and unleash 
the power of the private sector-and particularly small 
businesses-to create jobs and drive economic growth.\" 
 
 
 
----------------------- 
Activities and Exhibits 
----------------------- 
 
4.  USAID implementing partners set up displays in 
booths on the Mission grounds representing projects 
organized under USAID\'s four strategic objectives. 
The diversity of the projects represented by USAID\'s 
implementing partners reflected the wide reach of 
American assistance to Malawi.  President Mutharika and 
seven government ministers inspected over half of the 
exhibits, television cameras in tow, providing an 
excellent opportunity for government officials and the 
media to focus on specific USAID activities. 
 
5.  One sustainable-agricultural project displayed 
three rows of corn plants that graphically demonstrated 
the results of three different growing regimens: no 
fertilizer, inadequately applied fertilizer and 
following a proper fertilizer regime.   Health sector 
partners featured the life-saving work they do to 
combat malaria and HIV/AIDS and to promote child 
health, nutrition, and survival.  Paralegals from 
Malawi Carer, an NGO dedicated to educating Malawians 
about their rights under the law, were able to explain 
their work to the President himself, something that 
later became part of television coverage of the event. 
One female member of parliament greeted the attendants 
at the International Republican Institute booth with 
affection and enthusiasm saying, \"I won my seat because 
of the tips I learned in your training workshop!\" 
Malawi\'s flagship educational institutions were also 
represented, showcasing USAID\'s key role in investing 
in education and human resource development. 
 
------------------ 
And the Winner is. 
------------------ 
 
6.  The most charismatic project participants were, 
without question, two calves brought by Land of Lakes 
to exhibit its work in sustainable small-holder dairy 
farming.  The calves provided color commentary 
throughout the day, including when the President 
inspected them with his retinue.  Along with the rural 
woman accompanying them, they articulated an important 
economic message--by investing in a dairy cow and 
dedicating part of a quarter-hectare plot to 
maintaining it, a small-holder rural household can 
stimulate economic growth and diversification in the 
community, empower women, and promote health and 
nutrition. 
 
-------------- 
Media Coverage 
-------------- 
 
7.  A joint USAID-Public Affairs media strategy 
successfully obtained positive--and ongoing--coverage 
of USG programs in Malawi.  Mission Director Yochelson 
was the featured guest in a half-hour interview program 
on Television Malawi (TVM), Malawi\'s only television 
network.  The program was broadcast on the eve of the 
event and allowed the Mission Director to speak 
directly to Malawians about USAID\'s activities, and 
more importantly, about why the USG has invested in 
Malawi\'s development during the past 44 years.  Stories 
in national dailies, a radio interview on Malawi 
Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) and the TVM program 
created strong media momentum before the event, 
focusing national attention on USAID\'s current and past 
programs and making the Anniversary a \"hot ticket\" for 
government officials and invited guests. 
 
8.  Public Affairs organized interviews during the 
event by TVM reporters with USAID\'s strategic objective 
team leaders and their implementing partners.  These 
were edited into a ten-minute national news story about 
the Anniversary.  Coverage on the day of the event 
included stories in major dailies and a broadcast of 
the President\'s speech in its entirety.  Stories in 
most of Malawi\'s national and regional print media 
filtered out in the days following the event and 
continue to appear as of October 26.  In an effort to 
reach the eighty-percent of Malawians who get their 
news from indigenous-language radio, Public Affairs 
organized a Chichewa language radio story with 
reporters from MBC and USAID\'s democracy and governance 
team leader.  The story featured interviews with 
paralegals working to educate Malawians in a village 
near Dedza about their legal rights.  Because the 
interviews were conducted in Chichewa, clients were 
able to tell how they benefited from this program 
directly to other Malawians. 
 
9.  Comment: The USAID Anniversary created the rare 
opportunity to focus national attention on the USG\'s 
development work in Malawi, and by all accounts was a 
tremendous success.  Because USAID does not provide 
direct budgetary support to the GOM, its work can tend 
to be undervalued by some ministers who do not feel 
that they benefit directly from USAID projects. 
President Mutharika\'s participation in the event, and 
the extensive media coverage of USAID projects, served 
as a healthy corrective to that perception.  The 
President also broke with precedent in attending a 
purely bilateral event, lending real weight to the 
assertion that he desires to strengthen bilateral ties 
with the U.S.

This message is sensitive but unclassified--not for Internet

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The Government of Malawi has recently raised retail 
fuel prices for the first time since March 2004.  The 
increase amounts to 8.9 percent on gasoline and diesel, 
reflecting only about half of the increase in world petroleum 
prices during the past six months.  The increase, which is 
expected to have immediate inflationary implications, comes 
at a time of increasing inflationary pressure in Malawi. 
Whereas the inflation of a full price pass-through could 
derail Malawi\'s IMF staff-monitored program, interference in 
the pricing mechanism may be of concern during the upcoming 
IMF staff visit.  End summary. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
A MODEST INCREASE, LONG DELAYED 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On October 22, the GoM raised retail fuel prices by 
8.9 percent, the first price increase since last March. 
Prices went from MK94.30 to MK102.70 ($0.88 to $0.96) per 
liter for gasoline and from MK87.60 to MK95.40 ($0.82 to 
$0.89) for diesel.  An increase had been recommended by the 
Petroleum Control Commission (PCC) since April, but for 
political reasons, former President Bakili Muluzi had quashed 
adjustments in the run-up to May elections.  The new 
administration of President Bingu wa Mutharika had not 
addressed the issue since its assumption of office at the end 
of May and indeed had promised within the past month that 
prices would not be raised. 
 
3. (SBU) As a result of increases in world fuel prices, the 
government-controlled consortium of private fuel importers, 
Petroleum Importers Ltd. (PIL), was facing potential losses 
of MK 30-40 million ($280,000 - $374,000) per month, 
according to one member of the consortium.  (NOTE: PIL 
includes two U.S. business interests: ExxonMobil and Caltex. 
End Note.)  PIL had not yet reached a crisis, largely because 
the retail price includes levies for price stabilization and 
for reimbursing PIL when prices are not adjusted quickly 
enough.  However, the price stabilization fund, which is 
designed to smooth out short-term spikes in world prices, was 
on its way to exhaustion before the end of October.  At that 
point, PIL would have had to cut back on import volumes, 
causing fuel shortages. 
 
 
---------------------- 
INFLATIONARY REALITIES 
---------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) On October 5, the PCC had recommended that gasoline 
be increased to MK108 and diesel to MK102.  These prices 
would have reflected world increases (estimated locally at 
17-20 percent), but they would also have brought inflationary 
pressure to bear on the Malawian economy.  Because of 
Malawi\'s reliance on overland imports, and disproportionately 
on fuel-inefficient trucking, the inflationary impact of fuel 
price hikes is rapid and widespread.  This fact is 
intensified by timing: the spring and summer here (October to 
March) are the high season for inflation, due to seasonality 
in agricultural input and food prices.  And any inflation 
above 20 percent would put Malawi off-track for its IMF 
staff-monitored program. 
 
5. (SBU) For understandable reasons, then, the Government 
chose not to unleash the PCC\'s automatic pricing mechanism, 
which is designed to pass through sharp increases in world 
prices (greater than 5 percent).  Instead, GoM has simply 
increased the levy that reimburses the importers for import 
losses caused by artificially low prices.  In essence, this 
allows the importers (PIL) to recover most of their losses 
directly, while sparing the public the collateral increases 
that an adjustment in the base price would entail (through 
percentage-based increases in other levies and profit 
margin). 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
COMMENT: A SENSIBLE MIDDLE COURSE? 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) While the 8.9 percent price hike may seem a sensible 
middle course between an inflationary full-price adjustment 
and popular but irresponsible inaction, there are some 
downsides to this course.  First, it suppresses the PCC\'s 
automatic pricing mechanism, which continues Muluzi\'s 
practice of tinkering with the pricing and levy structure to 
meet the exigencies of the day.  If full adjustment follows 
next year, after inflationary pressures have subsided, the 
GOM\'s solution may be viewed as a wise interim measure.  On 
the other hand, if the Kwacha is devalued, or if an 
inflationary cycle picks up for other reasons, full 
adjustment may be put off, leading to a bigger shock later. 
Second, industry sources tell us that Malawi\'s low retail 
prices are driving some informal exports, which could result 
in shortages. 
 
7. (SBU) Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is unclear 
at this juncture how the IMF will view continued suspension 
of PCC\'s automatic pricing mechanism.  Its proper functioning 
was a required prior action for previous IMF facilities, and 
IMF\'s November staff visit could highlight this as a 
recurring problem.  In our view, it is more likely the IMF 
will see the partial adjustment as an understandable effort 
to avoid both fuel shortages and inflationary price shock.

SUBJECT: MALAWI\'S FORMER FINANCE MINISTER ARRESTED FOR 
CORRUPTION 
 
REF: LILONGWE 839 
 
1.  (U) Former Minister of Finance Friday Jumbe was arrested 
on October 27 as he attempted to leave Malawi for South 
Africa.  Though the Director of Public Prosecutions, the 
Anti-Corruption Bureau, and Jumbe\'s lawyer have not publicly 
said what charges Jumbe faces, his arrest is widely thought 
to be related to the 2002 maize scandal (reftel).  The ACB 
has also reportedly ordered Jumbe to hand over an inventory 
of his assets within seven days. According to unconfirmed 
reports, Jumbe was picked up at Blantyre\'s Chileka Airport as 
he tried to board a flight for South Africa, ostensibly to 
buy parts to repair his Mercedes. 
 
2. (SBU) Since the release two months ago of an independent 
commission\'s report on the maize scandal, the public has 
demanded prosecution of those responsible.  The maize scandal 
is the perhaps the most sensitive of several pending 
corruption cases, both because it entailed profit-taking from 
a starvation-relief program, and because the commission\'s 
report implicated several very high-ranking GOM officials. 
 
2.  (SBU) COMMENT. Jumbe is a stalwart Muluzi loyalist and 
erstwhile senior official in the nominally ruling United 
Democratic Front (UDF).  His arrest follows a clear split 
between President Bingu wa Mutharika and former President 
Bakili Muluzi\'s loyalists within the UDF; it is the second 
arrest of a Muluzi minister on corruption or financial crimes 
charges since Mutharika took office in May.  Several senior 
UDF officials have also been arrested on corruption charges.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The new director of the Anti Corruption Bureau 
recently discussed his pending prosecutions and strategic 
vision for the agency.  He is focusing on five grand 
corruption cases, all against senior public figures.  He 
intends to forego longer-range public outreach and prevention 
plans for winning big, current cases with recoverable assets. 
 End summary. 
 
 
------------------------- 
FIVE HIGH-LEVEL CASES NOW 
------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Econoffs recently paid a courtesy call on the 
Gustave Kaliwo, the new director of Malawi\'s Anti Corruption 
Bureau (ACB) (ref B).  Kaliwo updated us on the bureau\'s 
leading cases and on the future, the priorities, and the 
challenges facing the ACB.  Kaliwo\'s agency has five 
high-profile cases facing it at the moment: 
 
-  The Apex car case, in which GOM officials colluded to buy 
used vehicles for the GOM as new.  The case has been prepared 
and is awaiting the Director of Public Prosecution\'s (DPP) 
approval to prosecute.  This case may involve three former 
cabinet ministers. 
 
-  The Securicom case, involving fraudulent contracts for a 
national identity card system, is awaiting DPP approval. 
 
-  The Shire Bus Lines case, where CEO Humphrey Mvula has 
been arrested and charged with fraudulent deals on buses and 
spare parts, was schedule to go to court on October 28. 
Coincidentally, Mvula, who was out on bail in the corruption 
case, was arrested this week on a murder charge in the death 
of a Muslim cleric for political reasons in 2002.  Mvula is 
the official spokesman of the ruling United Democratic Front 
political party. 
 
-  The maize scandal, in which former Finance Minister Friday 
Jumbe is charged with illegally diverting maize from the 
strategic grain reserve for private export.  Jumbe was 
arrested on October 27 while attempting to flee the country 
(ref C).  More arrests will likely follow. 
 
- The Ministry of Sports scandal, in which Ministry money was 
transferred to UDF operatives to pay for election expenses. 
Arrests are expected in the next several days. 
 
3. (SBU) Of his approach to prosecutions, Kaliwo said that he 
wanted to be careful not to chase too many cases at once with 
his limited staff; he thought half a dozen large cases at a 
time was roughly the capacity of his present staff.  Kaliwo 
has received funding to hire more staff, particularly more 
staff prosecutors, but ACB has just confirmed the funding and 
begun to advertise for the jobs.  Even at double the funding 
the bureau has over last year\'s budget, though, he feels the 
GOM should commit itself to still more funding.  He stated 
strongly that this is a core function of the GOM that should 
not rely on donor participation.  In his words, Government 
must accept that \"ACB is their baby.\" 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
CORRUPTION IS STILL MANAGEABLE; FOCUS ON CURRENT CORRUPTION 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Kaliwo agreed with the commonplace view that 
corruption, in the form of grand corruption, had only won a 
foothold in Malawi during the Muluzi administration. 
Corruption on a cultural level--pervasive petty 
corruption--is not yet a problem here and, Kaliwo felt, could 
be prevented with prosecutions of big cases.  However, some 
Government institutions, notably the Immigration Office, have 
become corrupt at lower levels, and should be targeted for 
investigation.  Kaliwo believes a few such prosecutions could 
well fix the problem. 
 
5. (SBU) As for the strategic direction of ACB, Kaliwo wants 
to reconsider the bureau\'s five-year plan.  He wants to 
examine why the ACB has historically failed to deliver, and 
base a new strategy on that understanding of past failure to 
perform.  He indicated that he would likely steer the plan 
away from extensive new training, prevention, and public 
outreach programs (with the exception of establishing a 
24-hour hotline) in favor of focusing more tightly on a 
handful of prosecutions.  These, he said, should be directed 
against big, fairly current malfeasance and, where possible, 
on recoverable assets. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
COMMENT: MORE VISION, MORE ENERGY, MORE REALISM 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (SBU) The new ACB chief appears to bring to the bureau a 
sharper vision and far more energy than his predecessor, a 
phlegmatic if distinguished jurist.  Put simply, Kaliwo is 
all about putting the big guys in jail, and doing it now.  He 
is clear about the necessity of not spending scarce resources 
trying to chase every potential case, nor in pursuing 
long-range goals with training and public awareness. We view 
this as an appropriate concentration on achieving realistic 
short-term goals with modest means.

CAUSES

     B. STATE 184081 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
1.  (U) Charge and poloff paid an introductory call on 
Malawi\'s Minister of Gender, Child Welfare, and Community 
Services, Joyce Banda on October 28.  Charge used the 
opportunity to follow up on the previously raised issue of 
trafficking in persons (TIP) (reftel A), a topic Banda was 
eager to discuss.  While she expressed some frustration with 
the USG\'s TIP policy, Banda said that the new Malawi 
government recognizes the seriousness of the problem and is 
taking steps to address the root causes of human trafficking. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
 
CONTEXT, PERSPECTIVE, AND REALITY 
--------------------------------- 
2.  (U) The GOM\'s approach to TIP is that it is a symptom of 
a larger problem, and that the underlying causes must be 
addressed in order to reduce all forms of TIP.  Banda pointed 
out that a growing number of households in Malawi are headed 
by orphans whose parents have died of HIV/AIDS.  A struggling 
economy, oppressive poverty, soaring HIV/AIDS infection 
rates, and low access to education also limit options for 
prosperity.  Prostitution, she said, is not an organized 
activity and is usually the last resort a young woman may 
have in order to survive.  Banda said that while disagreeing 
with the data in the TIP report, the GOM could not ignore the 
existence of TIP - even if it hadn\'t understood the 
definition - and had to \"look at the problem critically and 
move to work against it\". 
 
 
THE GOM\'S SHORT TERM ACCOMPLISHMENTS... 
--------------------------------------- 
3.  (SBU) Banda noted that following our previous 
conversation about trafficking, she passed a copy of the 2003 
TIP Report and her concerns about it (and the overall issue) 
along to President Mutharika.  According to Banda, the 
President then called an inter-ministerial meeting to discuss 
both the report and the problem.  Since that time, she said, 
the GOM has developed a National Gender Program to address 
cross-cutting gender issues in Malawi.  In May, the new 
administration conducted a rapid assessment of the situation 
of orphans in the country  and determined that they are at 
particular risk for various forms of exploitation. To counter 
this, the GOM has developed and will soon begin implementing 
a national action plan for orphans and vulnerable children, 
which will aim to reduce the root causes of victimization. 
The GOM, with assistance from NGOs and other donors, has paid 
the school fees for more than 600 students this year, and the 
Minister hopes to reach a target of assisting 10,000 orphans 
to return to school in the next year. 
 
 
...AND LONG TERM STRATEGY 
------------------------- 
4.  (U) The national action plan for orphans and vulnerable 
children will be launched on November 8 with initial training 
for more than 200 new child protection officers in every 
district of the country.  The plan, which is slated to last 
for five years, includes six key strategies: Capacity 
building, beginning with the initial training and placement 
of the officers in each constituency of the country; 
household and community education; protection of children in 
danger; assistance to victims; skills building, including 
vocational training and life skills; and strengthened legal 
protections for children and orphans. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
5.  (SBU) Banda is new to government, having spent her entire 
career working with NGOs as an advocate for the rights of 
women and children.  She is an energetic public servant who 
has clearly placed TIP high on her agenda.  She noted that 
the new government of President Mutharika is taking the issue 
seriously and that the President has taken a personal 
interest.  Additional work is underway in other sectors of 
government to combat the problem. Charge and poloff have, in 
numerous meetings with GOM officials, raised the points in 
reftel B.  Further GOM action will be reported septel.

SUBJECT: MUTHARIKA CREATES NEW WEEKLY TO COUNTER PRO-MULUZI 
MEDIA 
 
REF: LILONGWE 1018 
 
Classified By: DCM DAVID GILMOUR FOR REASONS 1.5 (b/d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  A new newspaper, Democratus, has begun 
circulation in Malawi amid a growing fragmentation of the 
ruling United Democratic Front (UDF).  President Mutharika 
and his closest advisors are reportedly providing financial 
support and other resources for the new weekly. In the wake 
of a public disagreement on fundamental political issues 
between Mutharika and former president Muluzi, Democratus 
will apparently offer the Mutharika camp,s version of the 
news. END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
More Political News for Malawi\'s Readers 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) A new Malawian national weekly, Democratus, arrived at 
newsstands October 30 under the banner \"Growing With 
Democratic Values.\"  Although required under Malawian media 
rules, the paper contained no statement of ownership, however 
mission contacts believe the paper is being financed by 
President Mutharika and senior political advisors.  The paper 
has already hired some of Malawi\'s leading print journalists, 
including Dennis Mzembe, former chief reporter for national 
daily the Nation (ciculation 20,000), who assumed the role of 
editor-in-chief.  Public Affairs contacts report that 
salaries and perks for Democratus\' staff are the highest in 
the country. 
 
3. (C) The news coverage in the first edition was plainly 
pro-Mutharika, and supported his anti-corruption efforts 
against senior UDF officials affiliated with former president 
Bakili Muluzi.  In its maiden editorial comment, Democratus 
pledged to be a public watchdog that would provide accurate 
and balanced information: \"We commit ourselves to the ideals 
of fair play and professional journalism.\"  The most powerful 
statement of the first edition, however, came from the 16 
full pages of advertisements (worth over $6,000 USD) from the 
Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF).  MASAF is a large-scale 
poverty alleviation and infrastructure project funded by the 
World Bank.  The chairman is appointed directly by the 
President. 
 
4. (C) Media insiders have asserted that President Mutharika 
was advised to create a media organ to counter the strong 
pro-Muluzi bias in many papers.  These continue to 
characterize Mutharika\'s anti-corruption efforts as political 
\"persecutions\" rather than legitimate prosecutions of 
corruption cases.  Democratus\' lavish funding and 
government-generated advertising revenue are already 
producing a backlash among other media houses. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Muluzi Falls Silent in the Media 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) For several months, President Mutharika has maintained 
an acrimonious and public dispute with the Muluzi-dominated 
UDF about the supremacy of a sitting government over the 
party that put it in power.  Muluzi had insisted that the 
UDF, of which he is president, was \"above\" the government. 
In recent weeks, however, Muluzi has fallen silent.  Despite 
a series of scathing attacks by leading Malawian clergy on 
corruption in his government, and the recent arrests of 
several high-profile corruption defendants (reftel),  Muluzi 
has surprised local observers by not defending himself and 
his political cronies in the media. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT. Overall the print media is equally critical 
of Mutharika and Muluzi, but clearly Mutharika has felt it 
necessary to try to level the media playing field with his 
predecessor by establishing this newspaper.  At the same 
time, Mutharika is softening his tone toward the UDF, in 
order to strengthen his base in the party.  On November 2 
Mutharika declared the UDF to be Malawi\'s ruling party, a 
significant position shift.  It remains to be seen whether 
Mulizi\'s sudden silence is a short-term tactical move or a 
willingness to finally begin to settle into the role of 
ex-president. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED. Mutharika\'s new paper will have to 
exercise some degree of restraint  in order to be taken 
seriously by the wider public: too much government funded 
advertising may risk the credibility of his efforts to 
promote fiscal responsibility and transparency.  Mutharika\'s 
political strategy must simultaneously seek to maintain his 
fragile base within the UDF while keeping Muluzi, the party 
president, at arm,s length. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: IMF REVIEW TEAM IN MALAWI 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) The International Monetary Fund\'s Staff Monitoring 
Program assessment team has briefed donor mission 
representatives twice since its arrival in Malawi.  The team 
leader has characterized the GOM\'s performance as good 
through the end of September and outlined a scenario under 
which the Fund may start a new Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Facility by April.  This preliminary assessment confirms our 
impression of Malawi\'s generally good fiscal performance 
since the current administration took office in May.  End 
summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
MEETING TARGETS BY A WIDE MARGIN 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In briefings on November 9 and November 17, the 
leader of the International Monetary Fund\'s (IMF) Staff 
Monitoring Program (SMP) assessment team John Green 
appraised Malawi\'s macroeconomic performance as \"so far, so 
good.\"  The team is assessing the GOM\'s performance through 
the end of September and will be in Malawi until 26 
November.  Before leaving the country, the team expects to 
issue an assessment letter and brief the press. 
 
3. (U) The team considers Malawi to be meeting its targets 
\"by a wide margin,\" the margin being due in part to delays 
in planned expenditures for commercial maize.  Even after 
the maize buy, Malawi will still meet all quantitative 
targets.  The country is reportedly on track for seven of 
its eight structural measures, with an agreement to delay 
the eighth (which concerns submission of outstanding check 
numbers to the Reserve Bank) until 1 December.  Based on the 
tight expenditure control the team has seen so far, the IMF 
is canceling plans it had to bring in a team to assist in 
expenditure management. 
 
4. (U) Green reported that the team had overestimated 
inflation in its planning; it now appears that inflation 
will be 14 to 15 percent at year end, as opposed to the 16- 
18 percent forecast in July and September.  As well, the 
foreign exchange inflows have been higher than projected, 
owing to an increase of $40 to $60 million in tobacco 
revenues over last year.  Forex reserves now stand at 1.7 
months in the central bank. 
 
-------------- 
DONOR CONCERNS 
-------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Donor representatives raised three concerns at the 
first IMF meeting: that the GOM might decide to break its 
budget in spending on a new building for Parliament, that 
the civil service wage reforms could be so unpopular as to 
spur a free-spending remedy, and that the IMF might be 
pressing the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates.  On the 
parliament building, Green said the IMF is not concerned, 
because any new building would take several years to 
construct, and thus poses no immediate danger to the budget. 
The civil service pay issue is \"more worrisome\" according to 
Green, and \"if it\'s a budget buster, then that\'s a problem.\" 
Green did note that the IMF has always seen the wage reform 
as difficult, and that it was confident that the issues 
could be successfully worked through.  (NOTE: Finance 
Minister Goodall Gondwe acknowledged that the GOM 
miscalculated the net effect of the wage package, and that 
settling government workers\' concerns about a net decrease 
in take-home pay would be easily resolved, with little 
effect on the budget.  End note.)  On interest rates, the 
IMF position is that the RBM should raise rates only if 
inflation begins to rise. 
 
 
---------- 
NEXT STEPS 
---------- 
 
6. (U) Under the current SMP, the IMF will continue to 
monitor performance with quarterly assessment missions.  The 
next mission will come in mid-February to look at 
performance through the end of December.  According to 
Green, in the best case IMF would negotiate a new PRGF to 
take effect from 1 April. 
 
COMMENT 
7. (SBU) The initial IMF briefings accord with our view of 
the GOM\'s performance since May.  While it is still 
distinctly possible that the situation may break down as it 
has in the past, the current Government seems to understand 
the importance of establishing a culture of fiscal 
responsibility and re-establishing its good name with 
international financial institutions.  Indeed, Gondwe has 
cautioned donors against prematurely celebrating the success 
of fiscal reforms, saying the GOM still has plenty of work 
ahead of it.  Meanwhile, USG support, via the Millennium 
Challenge Account\'s Threshold Program, can help boost 
precisely the same areas that both the IFIs and the 
Government have identified as central: fiscal policy and 
control of corruption.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Government wage reforms that took effect in October 
have produced some unrest among civil servants.  Hospital 
workers briefly struck in Lilongwe early this month, and 
teachers are threatening to strike in Blantyre.  The problems 
center on miscalculations in a consolidated pay packaged 
designed to rationalize a complex structure of allowances. 
While the situation will likely be resolved soon, the GOM has 
little room for more mistakes. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
WELL-INTENTIONED REFORMS CAUSE STRIKES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Civil service workers in health and education have 
been protesting over the last two weeks against the effects 
of civil service wage reforms passed in September.  Health 
workers at Lilongwe\'s Kamuzu Hospital went on strike for a 
few days at the beginning of November, and teachers in 
Blantyre are threatening to strike if the issue is not 
resolved in the next month.  The crux of the issue is that 
the reform package resulted in a net decrease in take-home 
pay for workers receiving special professional allowances. 
 
3. (U) The reforms were a World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund structural objective, aimed at addressing huge 
pay disparities between different levels of the civil 
service, as well as containing a runaway structure of 
allowances.  Years of political tinkering under the previous 
administration had created a grossly lopsided pay structure, 
with the lower rungs of the scale among the worst-paid in 
Africa, and the top rungs significantly higher than regional 
norms.  For example, a promotion from the senior-most 
mid-level rank to the lowest senior-level rank involved a pay 
increase of roughly 500 percent.  The pay package raised 
salaries between 25 and 80 percent, weighted toward the lower 
grades. 
 
4. (U) The other issue was the allowance structure, under 
which higher-ranking employees enjoyed substantial tax-free 
income from allowances for fuel, housing, food, and 
professional incentives (often amounting to over half of 
employees\' gross income).  Allowances had steadily increased 
over the past decade, becoming more top-heavy and less 
standard among different ministries over time.  The reforms 
attempted to clump all compensation as taxable pay, paving 
the way for greater regularity across the government and 
facilitating future adjustments.  While the change increased 
the gross cost of government salaries, the added revenue from 
a higher taxable base partially offset the increase. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, LESS PAY? 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Unhappily, the Ministry of Finance miscalculated 
several pieces of the package, forgetting to include 
professional allowances for health workers and teachers in 
the base pay computations, and miscalculating the net effect 
of taxing the entire package. The result: lower net pay for 
many mid-level civil servants.  After health workers walked 
out at the capital city\'s main hospital, GOM officials 
reinstated the professional and housing allowances, and 
hospital staff returned to work.  Now teachers are 
threatening to walk out over the same issue, but have held 
off on the strength of promises to restore the allowances, at 
least pending a final resolution. 
 
6. (U) Minister of Finance Goodall Gondwe has admitted the 
error publicly, and Ministry officials are busy re-vetting 
pay calculations.  In a recent briefing, Gondwe described 
this sort of problem as \"normal\" based on his experience at 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  He expects to have 
resolved the last of the problems by year end, with little 
effect on the budget. 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
COMMENT: MORE MISTAKES, MORE PRESSURE 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The magnitude of the pay reform problems are another 
indicator of a lack of wherewithal at the Ministry of 
Finance.  As the recent budget exercise showed, the Ministry 
often gets the details wrong even as they deal successfully 
with a massive change in fiscal direction.  Though 
rationalizing government salaries is crucial to getting 
fiscal policy under control, the risk attached to fumbling 
the reforms is great.  Though organized labor is generally 
weak in Malawi, government has perhaps the best-organized 
workforce in the country, and it might be able to force 
expensive concessions if it feels sufficiently threatened. 
So far, this qualifies as a minor dispute, more embarassing 
than damaging.  But with no room in the budget for mistakes, 
and with Malawi\'s fiscal resolve under an IMF microscope, 
Government can ill afford anything approaching a serious 
labor dispute.

REF: SECSTATE 239929 
 
1. General Overview of Auditing Procedures: 
With an instituted public finance act of Parliament, Malawi\'s 
military expenditures are audited by the Auditor General, as 
is the case with all other Government institutions.  Audit 
reports are circulated to relevant civilian ministries: 
Defense, Finance and the Office of the President and Cabinet. 
 Access to some military audit information may sometimes be 
limited due to military security; this is most frequently 
true of intelligence activities.  Though security has been 
used to cover malfeasance, it is thought that these instances 
are rare. 
 
2. Military Budget, On- and Off-Budget Revenues and Expenses: 
Malawi\'s defense budget is separate from that of the security 
forces.  The country\'s security force falls under the 
Ministry of Home Affairs, which has its own budget 
allocation.  Embassy knows of no special off-budget receipts. 
 
3. Military Component of the National Budget: 
The National Assembly debates and approves proposed budgets. 
The military budget is in two parts: 1) development, and 2) 
recurrent and other transactions.  The development budget 
covers capital expenditures such as new infrastructure.  The 
recurrent and other transactions budget covers all 
operational expenses.  Ministry of Finance monitors the 
military budget execution on a monthly basis.

BINGU\'S SUPPORT STAYS STEADY 
 
REF: LILONGWE 1035 
 
1. (U) Summary: Members of the United Democratic Front (UDF) 
have become more outspoken in their criticism of President 
Bingu wa Mutharika, widening the split in the party.  The UDF 
executive committee has punished ministers close to 
Mutharika, taking away party positions and perks.  Despite 
this very public dispute, President Mutharika\'s public 
support remains strong.  End summary. 
 
Getting Louder and Nastier 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The split in Malawi\'s ruling United Democratic Front 
became more pronounced this week with the announcement by a 
national executive committee member, former minister and 
Muluzi loyalist Dumbo Lemani, of alleged fraud in the May 20 
election that brought President Mutharika to power.  Lemani 
claims to have information from UDF senior official Humphrey 
Mvula (who is currently in jail awaiting trial on murder and 
corruption charges) that Mvula arranged to have 362,000 votes 
diverted to the UDF in Mutharika\'s favor.  Lemani claims that 
Mvula is prepared to give the evidence in court, as testimony 
in an ongoing suit brought earlier this year by the 
opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) and Mgwirizano 
Coalition, which contested the election results.  (Note: A 
swing of just over 160,000 votes from Mutharika to MCP 
candidate John Tembo would give the Presidency to Tembo.  End 
note.) 
 
3. (U) The revelation follows several weeks of escalating 
rhetoric from pro-Muluzi UDF members who resent what they see 
as Mutharika\'s increasing independence from the party and 
lack of sufficient deference to Muluzi.  Much of their 
anxiety is caused by the arrest of former officials of 
Muluzi\'s government.  Muluzi loyalists have been loudly 
complaining in the media that the GOM is on a political 
witch-hunt.  Some have even asked the Malawi Human Rights 
Commission to investigate the government\'s tactics. 
 
4. (U) At the same time, the UDF executive committee has 
targeted several ministers who are know to be close to 
Mutharika, stripping them of their party positions and 
privileges.  These include Information Minister Ken Lipenga, 
Foreign Minister George Chaponda, Education Minister Yusuf 
Mwawa, Home Affairs Minister Uladi Mussa, and Gender Minister 
Joyce Banda.  In the case of Banda, the UDF very publicly 
took away her party vehicle, saying that she was too active 
in organizing women in favor of government policies. 
 
Attacks Not Having the Desired Effect 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Despite weeks of increasing criticism from the 
disgruntled UDF members, President Mutharika remains 
politically popular and is carrying forward his agenda.  The 
Malawian public remains very supportive of Mutharika\'s 
ant-corruption campaign, and is satisfied to see the arrests 
of certain former Muluzi ministers who were widely perceived 
to be engaged in unsavory activities.  As one high-level 
contact told us this week \"no one feels sorry for these guys.\" 
 
6. (SBU) Mutharika himself appears to be taking the high road 
in all of this.  He has not responded to these attacks, nor 
have his ministers.  The actions by the UDF to strip key 
ministers of their party positions was met with very little 
public comment by those affected.   In several public 
appearances in the past week the president has appeared 
relaxed and confident.  He appears to be concentrating on the 
business of governing, and not allowing himself to be pulled 
into petty party squabbles. 
 
Broadening the Base 
------------------- 
 
7. (U) Mutharika has met recently with a number of difference 
constituencies such as university students and workers, in 
high-profile public appearances, in an apparent effort to 
broaden his political base and emphasize that he is the 
president of all Malawians, not just members of the UDF.  A 
speech to students at Chancellor College generated much 
positive media coverage and favorable editorials for having 
the courage to take on a university audience. 
 
8. (U) The president has built a de facto coalition with the 
opposition, based on his \"zero tolerance\" anti-corruption 
stance and fiscal conservatism, that is holding very well. 
The opposition parties have not been very critical of his 
policies.  Only in the past two weeks have there been some 
noises from the opposition that their support has limits, and 
that they expect to see results soon, particularly in the 
area of corruption. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (SBU) Despite these strident attacks, Mutharika continues 
to gain support with the wider Malawian public.  He has 
plenty of political capital, but the goodwill cannot last 
forever.  To maintain public confidence, Mutharika must gain 
successful convictions in at least some of the high-profile 
corruption cases that are currently awaiting trial.  Failure 
to achieve that could endanger much of his reform program and 
signal opposition politicians to seek stronger leadership 
elsewhere.  For the time being, though, Mutharika is the 
strongest player in the game, and both the opposition and 
most of the UDF continue to follow him.

SUBJECT: SHIFTING HANDOUTS FOR MALAWI\'S FARMERS 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified--not for Internet 
distribution. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The GOM has changed its approach to providing 
subsidized inputs to subsistence farmers.  The new plan will 
provide seed and fertilizer packages to 2 million 
families--twice the amount planned earlier--and free 
fertilizer to another 500,000, at a total cost of MK3.68 
billion ($34.4 million).  The plan will exceed the budgeted 
amount for agricultural inputs by MK1.2 billion ($10.1 
million), which the GOM hopes to make up for with a larger 
contribution from donors and savings from a smaller purchase 
of commercial maize.  The plan is so late being decided upon 
that it may be overtaken by the onset of Malawi\'s rainy 
season.  End summary. 
 
 
------------------------------------ 
WELL-LAID PLANS VS. POPULIST DEMANDS 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) Upon coming into office in the dead of winter 
(June-July), the newly elected government had planned a 
modest agricultural input subsidy program: a Targeted Input 
Program (TIP) package for a million farmers.  The TIP package 
would consist of 25 kg of fertilizer, 5 kg of maize seed, and 
2 kg of pulse seed.  As spring approached, though, the demand 
for additional fertilizer subsidies elicited a promise of a 
voucher program for 50 kg of half-price fertilizer targeted 
at 500,000 farmers.  This was the result of rising fertilizer 
prices and demands from opposition politicians who consider 
universally subsidized fertilizer prices to be practically a 
basic human right in Malawi.  (The politicians, largely from 
the opposition Malawi Congress Party, argued that singling 
out poor farmers for subsidies amounts to discrimination; 
everyone should enjoy cheap fertilizer.)  Settling on a 
targeted voucher program for only 500,000 of the neediest 
farmers represented a significant political compromise. 
 
 
--------------- 
TIME FOR PLAN B 
--------------- 
 
3. (U) The voucher program quickly ran into implementation 
problems.  The Ministry of Finance ultimately took the 
program away from the Ministry of Agriculture and combined 
the two programs (TIP for 1 million and fertilizer voucher 
for 500,000) into a single TIP for two million farmers.  The 
popular cry for a pure fertilizer subsidy continued, though, 
and in mid-November the GOM announced that a voucher program 
for 500,000 would happen after all. 
 
4. (U) The voucher program faces several potential problems. 
First is timing: the yearly rains have already begun, and 
farmers have a short (several week long) planting window for 
maize.  Second, because the GOM has not coordinated the 
program with commercial importers, there may not be adequate 
fertilizer supplies in Malawi to implement it over the next 
few weeks.  This supply problem will almost surely make the 
price of the program higher as well.  Finally, there is a 
funding gap. 
 
5. (SBU) Though some of the TIP is directly funded by the UK, 
the expansion of the TIP and the addition of the fertilizer 
voucher program have created a budgetary shortfall of MK1.2 
billion ($10.1 million) beyond the figure agreed to by the 
International Monetary Fund\'s Staff-Monitored Program. 
Finance Minister Goodall Gondwe has suggested that this 
shortfall might be reduced by with a combination of good 
bargaining on fertilizer purchases and a smaller purchase of 
commercial maize.  It may be that, since Gondwe appears to 
view both the maize purchase and the fertilizer voucher 
program as political sops, he sees some budgetary saving 
potential in delaying implementation until the rains have 
made it impossible. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
COMMENT: A BALANCING ACT, WITH COMPLICATIONS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The battle over subsidized agricultural inputs is 
indicative of the pressures on the Mutharika government.  The 
political system is accustomed to providing cheap or free 
inputs for subsistence farmers; practically everyone sees 
limiting subsidies as unreasonable, perhaps inhumane, and 
certainly dangerous politically.  On the other hand, 
containing government spending is the imperative of the day 
for Malawi.  The GOM is struggling to balance fiscal 
credibility with political necessity, and the outcome is 
still uncertain.  The difference between Mutharika\'s success 
and failure may lie in the next rain cloud, or the next tick 
in world oil prices.

SUBJECT: GARMENT MAKERS NOT PANICKING ABOUT QUOTAS 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Despite the impending demise of quotas, Malawi\'s 
garment makers expect to see few changes in the U.S. market 
in the near future.  They are banking on the prospect of 
protective measures against China becoming a reality in the 
next few months.  Malawi-based companies also have lower 
capital investment and lower operating costs than regional 
competitors, which makes them less concerned about the long 
run.  The GOM, meanwhile, has done nothing to prepare for 
potential downturns in the industry.  End summary. 
 
 
------------------------- 
GARMENT BUSINESS AS USUAL 
------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In the face of the beginning of the end of quotas in 
January 2005, Malawi\'s garment manufacturers are taking a 
\"wait and see\" approach.  Recent conversations with several 
garment industry executives have shown that they expect the 
USG to implement some last-minute restrictions on Chinese 
imports to the U.S., which would give them at least momentary 
breathing space under the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
(AGOA).  The manufacturers are generally not planning any 
drastic changes in their operations or investments. 
 
3. (SBU) One manufacturer is suspending plans for one year 
its plans to build a plant for the U.S. market.  Others have 
told us that they intend to work on cutting costs and to 
lobby the GOM to make faster progress on the Nacala Corridor 
project, providing cheaper and more reliable access to sea 
shipping.  In general, though, the industry here seems to be 
operating on the assumption that their U.S. markets will 
remain fairly stable over the next year. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
SHORT-TERM CONFIDENCE IN MALAWI\'S ADVANTAGES 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) At least one Malawi-based manufacturer describes the 
labor environment as an advantage for Malawi over other 
African countries.  Workers here earn about $30 per month, as 
opposed to $120 per month in Lesotho and even more in 
Swaziland.  This is expected to continue balancing out 
Malawi\'s very high transportation costs.  Other advantages 
include a better security environment and docile unions. 
 
5. (SBU) Another advantage not cited by the garment makers is 
the low level of capital and organizational investment here. 
Factories tend to be cheaply leased, re-purposed buildings 
with few fixed capital improvements; most management staff is 
typically resident aliens.  Thus, current operating costs 
account for nearly the whole picture, and long-term prospects 
are less important than in locations where more has been 
committed.  Simply put, Malawi\'s garment makers are focused 
almost exclusively on the short term. 
 
 
6. (SBU) The Government, meanwhile, was unaware of the 
impending changes until we mentioned it in recent 
conversation with Trade Ministry officials.  Not 
surprisingly, they have made no plans for potential shifts in 
the export market nor for the unemployment that would almost 
inevitably follow.  Embassy is undertaking an effort to help 
the GOM focus on developing an export strategy, which 
includes using the Southern Africa Global Competitiveness hub 
to target other potential AGOA exports. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
COMMENT: GOVERNMENT NOT ENGAGED 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Malawi-based manufacturers\' apparent unconcern over 
the lifting of quotas may be partly naivete, but we interpret 
it as mostly a sign of their confidence in the U.S. garment 
industry\'s lobbying ability.  Certainly they have their 
reasons for short-term equanimity.  But the Government\'s 
ignorance of the situation and its longer-term implications 
is more worrisome.  AGOA is estimated to account for some 
7,000 otherwise scarce manufacturing jobs here, and the GOM 
has little idea what is happening in the sector.  We view 
this as symptomatic of the GOM\'s general lack of effective 
engagement with the private sector and with the 
nuts-and-bolts trade issues affecting it.  Changing that 
situation will be key to energizing Malawi\'s economy.

SUBJECT: BLANTYRE MAYOR ARRESTED FOR CORRUPTION 
 
REF: LILONGWE 1086 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified--not for Internet 
distribution. 
 
1. (U) The mayor of Malawi\'s largest city, Blantyre, has been 
arrested for corruption, according to unconfirmed newspaper 
reports.  John Chikakwiya, a senior member of the nominally 
ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) and one of the leading 
loyalists of former President Bakili Muluzi, is reported as 
having been arrested Thursday for stealing MK400,000 ($3,700) 
in donations targeted for maintaining city streets. 
 
2. (U) Chikakwiya is one of several members of a Muluzi 
loyalist faction that has been openly critical of President 
Bingu wa Mutharika\'s anti-corruption campaign, at least 
partly out of self-interest.  He and several other loyalists 
(Dumbo Lemani, Kennedy Makwangwala, and Salule Masangwi) held 
a press conference in late November condemning the arrests of 
former ministers and other senior UDF members as political 
persecution.  Chikakwiya has been a UDF extremist in the 
past; upon his (indirect) election as Blantyre\'s mayor in 
2000, he immediately banned all except UDF political 
demonstrations (though the courts quickly overturned the ban). 
 
3. (SBU) COMMENT: This arrest will doubtless intensify the 
growing rift between Mutharika\'s and Muluzi\'s political 
factions within the UDF (reftel).  Mutharika has arrested 
several of Muluzi\'s senior lieutenants in his anti-corruption 
campaign and shows no signs of letting up.  While most 
observers dismiss the accusations of political persecution, 
the GOM needs to make its first convictions, rather than more 
arrests, in order to maintain its popular legitimacy.

SUBJECT: MUTHARIKA TOUTS RURAL GROWTH, ESTABLISHES DONOR 
DIALOGUE 
 
 
1. Summary: President Mutharika summoned heads of mission to 
thank them for their support and to air his views on key 
policies.  He discussed his plans for rural poverty 
alleviation, the GOM\'s move to Lilongwe, and promised to have 
regular meetings with donors to establish a policy dialogue. 
End summary. 
 
2. President Mutharika convened the heads of diplomatic 
missions and donor organizations, along with most of his 
cabinet, on December 6 to thank donors for supporting his 
administration during its first six months in office. 
Mutharika observed that the GOM is now \"back on track\" with 
donors after the difficulties created by the previous 
administration.  He promised to keep public expenditure under 
control and vowed that the GOM will \"not slide back, but will 
move forward.\" 
 
3. Mutharika wants Malawi \"to shift from being a consuming 
country to a producing country, creating wealth and creating 
employment.\"  He said the key to economic transformation lies 
in empowering the rural poor, and he observed that lack of 
capital and lack of training are what keep rural people 
economically depressed.  To address this integrated rural 
development, he promised to revive a dormant GOM policy of 
creating \"rural growth centers\" that would enjoy all of the 
services that cities have, in terms of roads, electricity, 
water, telecoms, banks, etc.  He said that this would 
encourage people to stay on the land and stimulate the growth 
of regional areas. 
 
4. The president commented on the difficulties of 
implementing his two current rural poverty initiatives, the 
\"Targeted Input Program\" (TIP) to deliver seed and fertilizer 
packages to poor families, and a broader fertilizer subsidy 
program.  The TIP rollout has been delayed, he said, because 
of the logistical challenge of packaging and distributing 62 
million kilos of fertilizer and seed in small packages.  He 
cited problems with transport, but promised that he had now 
mobilized the Malawi Army to complete the distribution.  On 
the fertilizer subsidy, he attempted to clarify confusion 
about the program, saying that it was intended only for those 
who could not afford fertilizer, and that the GOM did not 
wish to distort the commercial market. 
 
5. Turning to his other major topic, the move of the GOM to 
Lilongwe, Mutharika stated that he would be moving into the 
New State House \"as soon as possible.\"  He denied media 
claims that he was spending lavishly to renovate the 
building, and said that his staff had only done cleaning and 
repairs and were moving the old furniture from the former 
Blantyre residence to save money.  He promised to continue to 
share the building with Parliament temporarily, but he was 
emphatic that Parliament must find a new permanent home. 
With that, he asked donors to contribute to the construction 
of a new Parliament building. 
 
6. The president then opened the floor for questions and 
comments, to which several of representatives responded. 
Most thanked him for the information and the opportunity for 
dialogue.  A few cautioned him about the need to communicate 
policies clearly, for example on the role of Parliament in 
Malawi\'s young democratic system, and in the setting of 
publicly announced targets for development projects. 
 
7. Finally, Mutharika expressed his desire to meet regularly, 
perhaps quarterly, with the diplomatic/donor heads, in order 
to establish a policy dialogue.  With that, he adjourned the 
meeting and invited the group for tea and further informal 
discussions. 
 
8. Comment:  If instituted as advertised, this forum will 
provide a useful vehicle to communicate donor concerns 
directly to the head of state.  Donor reps had suggested to 
the new GOM as early as August this year that such a forum be 
established.  In conversation with the Charge after the 
meeting, the president expressed his wish that the regular 
sessions be used to discuss policy issues in-depth, and said 
that he hopes for an honest dialogue where donors will give 
him feedback.  He mentioned that for the same reason, he had 
enthusiastically enlisted Malawi in the African Peer Review 
Mechanism, in order to get honest assessments of the 
country\'s policies.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) Malawi\'s Parliament appears to be in the process of 
defining a new, more active role for itself in economic 
policy.  Leading members of several relevant committees have 
told us they intend to hold public hearings on policy 
direction, to gain earlier access to draft legislation, and 
to head efforts to improve Government\'s execution of 
institutional reforms.  A better qualified crop of MPs, 
together with the absence of a ruling majority and a 
Government focus on reform, add up to an opportunity for more 
participatory legislature.  End summary. 
 
 
------------------------------ 
REACHING BEYOND MERE OVERSIGHT 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) Embassy recently held a series of conversations with 
leading members of the Parliamentary committees that have a 
role in economic and fiscal policy oversight: Public 
Accounts, Commerce and Industry, and Budget and Finance. 
While these committees have traditionally played purely an 
oversight role, the members were all quick to describe a more 
ambitious program for active participation in policy making. 
We have seen these committees in several policy-forming 
forums where they had not previously been engaged, which 
lends credence to their ambitions. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
A REFORMIST RULING-PARTY VIEW 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Maxwell Milazi, a freshman MP in the (nominally) 
governing United Democratic Front (UDF) and vice chair of the 
Commerce and Industry Committee, defined the first priority 
of the committee as oversight.  Asked about the future of the 
committee, he said he saw it moving toward determining 
economic policy jointly with Government.  His committee has 
plans to begin regular public hearings on a range of policy 
issues, from dumping to banking regulation.  It also plans to 
request draft budgets far enough in advance to formulate 
substantive input before the draft is formally presented to 
Parliament. 
 
4. (U) Milazi himself represents a reformist current in the 
UDF. Having been bypassed as the party choice for his 
district, Milazi ran as an independent, on the understanding 
that he would change back to UDF if he won.  After winning a 
bicycle-driven campaign against a well-connected incumbent 
with a party car, he has rejoined UDF but obviously owes less 
to the old guard than did his predecessor. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
THE MORE SEASONED LOYAL OPPOSITION 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Respicious Dzanjalimodzi, a freshman MP, chairman of 
the Public Accounts Committee and highly placed member of the 
opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP), described the new 
Parliament as having unique technical expertise.  He is 
himself a good example, as a former Secretary of the Treasury 
and 25-year civil servant.  Believing that UDF leadership has 
ruined the country\'s fiscal management systems, he sees his 
committee\'s role as providing firm leadership in restoring 
the system to soundness.  His committee, which has an audit 
oversight role, is going back as far as the 1997 budget year 
to uncover systemic accountability problems (and, no doubt, 
UDF-guided misappropriations). 
 
6. (SBU) Louis Chimango, a senior MCP member, former minister 
of finance, and creator of the Budget and Finance Committee, 
is a bit less ambitious than his younger colleagues.  He was 
more openly critical of Government and placed less hope in a 
new role for Parliament than in the political power of the 
opposition.  Even so, he said the committee has perhaps too 
timid a charter and intends to engage on a political level 
rather than technical.  Being an old hand in Parliament, he 
felt the new crop of Parliamentarians would need a couple 
years\' seasoning before they could effectively shape policy. 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
COMMENT: SEVERAL REASONS FOR A NEW ACTIVISM 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) These MPs\' descriptions of a more activist 
Parliament make sense for several reasons.  As Dzanjalimodzi 
intimated, and as nearly everyone here observes, this 
freshman crop has a much better background, educationally and 
professionally, than previous Assemblies.  Part of the reason 
is the UDF\'s loss of popularity as elections approached. 
With opposition parties having a real crack at power, their 
most seasoned politicos ran for office on the possibility of 
getting cabinet positions.  As it happens, they lost, and 
Parliament gets the benefit of an unusually experienced, 
educated, and ambitious collection of people. 
 
8. (SBU) As well, the absence of a clear majority in 
Parliament, and the loss of party discipline within the UDF 
itself, has created a new political chemistry.  Independent 
initiative, and the possibility of an independently minded 
Parliament, have left room for leadership that is not closely 
aligned either with the Government or a unified opposition. 
And now, the density of potential leaders is particularly 
high. 
9. (SBU) Finally, the leadership of the President Mutharika 
is influencing Parliamentary dynamics.  He has identified his 
presidency with a clear issues-oriented agenda and pushed 
away the old guard of his own UDF party with his 
anti-corruption campaign.  This has left many MPs without the 
traditional ready-made alignments.  As they puzzle this out, 
the possibility of making their mark within the Parliamentary 
institution looks more and more promising.

SUBJECT: MALAWI EDUCATION SECTOR STATISTICS 
 
 
1. Summary 
For the first time in many years the 
Government of Malawi (GOM), with support from USAID, 
has produced extensive data on the education sector. 
The data confirms that pupil-to-teacher ratios are very 
high, pupils-per-classroom ratios also are far above 
recommended norms, and that almost three-quarters of 
all students are beyond the normal age for their class. 
Encouraging findings include that most students have 
text books, and that through USAID and other efforts 
relatively few teachers remain who require basic 
teacher training.  The report will serve as an 
extremely useful tool for the GOM and donors in policy 
and planning efforts. 
 
2. Background 
The Ministry of Education has over the past decade 
struggled to provide timely, accurate and comprehensive 
data on its schooling system and processes. This has 
meant that decisions were made without any reference to 
meaningful data.  For the first time in many years the 
Education Management and Information System (EMIS) 
section of the Ministry of Education (MOE), with the 
support of USAID, has produced annualized data.  This 
is the most accurate report of its kind to date, and 
reflects an extremely high level of return, 
approximately 99% of all the questionnaires 
distributed. This unprecedented success was the result 
of the hard work of teachers and data collectors who 
worked tirelessly for almost eight months. 
 
3. Findings 
The 2004 EMIS Report confirms that at the national 
level the Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) is very high 
(1:72), compared with a policy of recommended levels no 
higher than 1:60; Rural schools are poorly resourced, 
and have fewer teachers than in the urban areas; and 
urban schools are overcrowded, but also with a surplus 
of teachers. 
 
4. In detail 
a) Out of the 3,166,786 primary pupils enrolled in 
school this year, 91.5 percent are enrolled in the 
rural schools. The national PTR in the rural schools 
stands at 1:77 against 1:44 in the urban schools. 
However, although the urban PTR is low, the Pupil 
Classroom Ratio (PCR) for the urban schools is at 
1:138 against a PCR of 1:105 in rural schools. 
Another disturbing feature is that 62 percent of 
rural teachers are male, raising the issue of the 
lack of role models for the rural girl child. 
 
b) Out of the total pupils enrolled, only 866,184 (27%) 
are of the rightful age to be in the primary system 
(6-13). 
 
c) Of those enrolled in Standard one, only 55.07 
percent are promoted to the next standard. In 
standard 8, which is the graduating class of the 
primary cycle, only 25.82 percent earn a completion 
certificate. The percentage of pupils repeating at 
the national level is at 19 percent. Repetition is 
very high at standard 1 and 3, 24.96 and 21.54 
percent respectively. The effect of repetition on 
the system is that pupils do not finish in time for 
their age, and over-age pupils remain in the system 
and further burden a system suffering for lack of 
resources. 
 
d) Quality input such as teaching and learning 
materials are adequately provided for. The Pupil/ 
Textbook ratio is at 1:1 in almost all the subjects 
at standard 1 and 1:2 in the other classes. This 
means that every child has a textbook. Another 
positive finding is that only 21.7 percent of 
teachers now remain to be trained and certified. 
 
5. Dissemination of findings 
A major challenge to be addressed is the dissemination 
of this report to a wide audience, and ensuring that 
all stakeholders understand what is happening in the 
education sector. Each school in the country should 
receive its own profile; each District Education Office 
(DEO), a full report; and presentation of summaries 
should be provided in the form of brochures to a 
variety of audiences. 
 
6. Comment 
With the release of the 2004 EMIS Report, the 
Government of Malawi (GOM) and donors have a tool with 
which they can develop a variety of strategies to 
address the skewed education delivery system. The GOM 
could consider for example moving more teachers into 
the rural schools to reduce the PTR, though there would 
be immediate needs such as housing and other monetary 
incentives to keep them there. The GOM could also 
consider constructing more schools in urban areas to 
tackle the current problem of over-crowding and 
redeployment of the surplus flock of teachers. A more 
difficult decision will need to be made with respect to 
over-age pupils.  The impact of much older students in 
lower grades is a serious one in Malawi. One approach 
under review would be to create alternative educational 
programs, including vocational training.

SUBJECT: MALAWI\'S FERTILIZER SHORTAGE THREATENS 2005 HARVEST 
 
REF: LILONGWE 1089 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) Malawi\'s farmers are unable to find enough fertilizer 
as they near the end of their yearly planting season.  The 
shortage results largely from Government delays in ordering 
stocks for its subsidy programs and confused signalling to 
private sector suppliers.  While the shortages are expected 
to clear by early January, they may have an impact on the 
harvest and thus on food supplies for 2005.  Opposition 
politicians are questioning the competence of the current 
Government.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
NOT ENOUGH, AND SLOW GETTING HERE 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) With the onset of yearly rains, Malawi\'s 2005 maize 
crop is in the ground and beginning to grow.  As the rains 
spread from south to north, November through late January is 
the time for farmers to apply fertilizer, which is a 
necessity in Malawi\'s nutrient-depleted soil.  Virtually all 
fertilizer is imported into the country through South Africa 
and the Mozambican ports of Beira and Nacala.  Malawi was 
estimated at the beginning of the season to require 228,000 
metric tons of fertilizer. By mid-December, only 121,000 tons 
had been landed--a shortfall of 107,000 tons, or 47 percent 
of the total. 
 
3. (U) The arrival of product already on its way here should 
alleviate the situation by early January.  Some 88,000 metric 
tons of fertilizer was in transit or on order by 
mid-December.  But the delivery of product in the supply 
pipeline is being delayed by a number of regional 
transportation problems.  These include weight restrictions 
on trucks passing through the South African/Zimbabwean border 
crossing at Beitbridge, a shortage in return loads to the 
port of Beira, and a number of problems with the rail 
connections and port at Nacala. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
GOVERNMENT THE MAIN CULPRIT 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Though the region\'s troubled transportation system 
is part of the problem, most of the blame for the shortage 
lies squarely with the GOM.  Political contention over the 
Targeted Input Program (TIP) and the fertilizer voucher 
scheme (see reftel) delayed Government\'s decision to place 
orders with importers in time.  TIP stocks were not ordered 
until near the end of October, and private suppliers could 
not obtain commercial financing without a government contract 
in hand. 
 
5. (SBU) Beyond the direct result of shortages for Government 
programs, the GOM\'s actions have also led to indirect market 
disruptions.  For example, dealers saw very low early-season 
sales following June pronouncements that the GOM would be 
able to lower prices with across-the-board subsidies.  In the 
absence of early sales (August to October), dealers have been 
not had the working capital to ramp up stocks to normal 
planting-season levels.  Private importers also delayed 
ordering stocks because, in the absence of a clearly defined 
subsidy, they could not project requirements or prices.  When 
the GOM finally announced the TIP program in October, most 
wholesalers sold their entire stocks to the Government.  This 
has left private buyers (about one-third of Malawi\'s farmers, 
including its highly efficient commercial farmers) with 
nothing to buy. 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
COMMENT: A QUESTION OF COMPETENCE 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) With its poor soil and strong preference for maize, 
Malawi\'s farmers need fertilizer to bring in a normal 
harvest, even when the region\'s notoriously unreliable 
weather cooperates.  If the shortage of fertilizer affects 
the 2005 harvest--as seems increasingly likely--the country 
will once again experience a food shortage late next year. 
The Malawian public is keenly aware of this possibility. 
Accordingly, the opposition parties have been raising an 
outcry over the situation in recent days. 
 
7. (SBU) Following hard on a controversy over bungled wage 
reforms, the fertilizer debacle has provided opposition 
figures, and President Mutharika\'s political enemies within 
the ruling party, the opportunity to portray the Government 
as disorganized and incompetent.  They are taking that 
opportunity with gusto.  The worst consequence of this 
political controversy may be that it makes the Mutharika 
government fear the marketplace all the more where critical 
commodities are concerned.  The reflex is still to seek 
statist solutions where there is no room for mistakes; 
unfortunately, state intervention itself seems usually to be 
the first mistake.

SUBJECT: MALAWI INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT, 2005 
 
REF: SECSTATE 25036 
 
Investment Climate Statement - Malawi 2005 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
---------------- 
 
1. Openness to Foreign Investment 
 
A. The Government encourages both domestic and foreign 
investment in most sectors of the economy, without 
restrictions on ownership, size of investment, source of 
funds, and destination of final product.  The Competition 
And Fair Trading Act -- passed by Parliament in November 
1998 but made operational in April 2000 -- aims to regulate 
and monitor monopolies and the concentration of economic 
power, protect consumer welfare, and strengthen the 
efficient production and distribution of goods and services. 
The Act calls for the formation of a commission that will 
approve only those acquisitions, mergers or takeovers that 
increase employment and net exports, and lower prices for 
consumers.  During the first half of 2000 the U.S.-based FCA 
Investment Company, together with the two local companies, 
acquired about 63% shares in the National Insurance Company 
of Malawi (NICO) through a cash takeover.  Ministry of Trade 
and Private Sector Development is in the process of 
appointing competition Commissioners who will later set up a 
secretariat to oversee implementation of the Competition and 
 
SIPDIS 
Fair Trading Act. 
 
B.  There is no government screening of foreign investment 
in Malawi.  Apart from the privatization program, the 
Government\'s overall economic and industrial policy does not 
have discriminatory effects on foreign investors.  Since 
industrial licensing in Malawi applies to both domestic and 
foreign investment, and is only restricted to a short list 
of products, it does not impede investment, limit 
competition, protect domestic interests, or discriminate 
against foreign investors at any stage of investment. 
Restrictions are based on environmental, health, and 
national security concerns.  Affected items are firearms; 
ammunition, chemical and biological weapons; explosives; and 
manufacturing involving hazardous waste treatment/disposal 
or radioactive material.  All regulations affecting trade 
(foreign exchange, taxes, etc.) apply equally to domestic 
and foreign investors. 
 
C.  As of December 2004, Malawi had privatized 61 units of 
approximately 110 state-owned enterprises targeted for 
privatization, generating about MK 1.0 billion (about USD 
9.2 million).  All investors, irrespective of ethnic group 
or source of capital (foreign or local) may participate in 
the privatization program.  However, the Malawi Stock 
Exchange regulations limit participation of an individual 
foreign portfolio investor to a maximum of 10% of any class 
or category of security under the program; and limit maximum 
total foreign investment in any portfolio to 49%.  The 
Privatization Act also prohibits members of the Cabinet, or 
employees of the Privatization Commission or its 
consultants, to participate in any divestiture except where 
an offer is made to the general public.  Malawian nationals 
are offered preferential treatment, including discounted 
share prices and subsidized credit.  Since July 2000, the 
maximum subsidized credit amount has been increased from 
20,000 Malawi Kwacha (MK) (about 184 USD) to MK 50,000 
(about 459 USD) and the minimum income threshold of MK 
10,000 per month (about 92 USD) was removed.  Subsidized 
credit carries a precondition that the shares or assets be 
retained for at least two years. 
 
2. Conversion and Transfer Policies 
 
A.  There are no restrictions on remittance of foreign 
investment funds (including capital, profits, loan 
repayments and lease repayments) as long as the capital and 
loans were obtained from foreign sources and registered with 
the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM).  The terms and conditions 
of international loans, management contracts, licensing and 
royalty arrangements, and similar transfers require initial 
RBM approval.  The RBM grants approval according to 
prevailing international standards; subsequent remittances 
do not require further approval.  All commercial banks are 
authorized by the RBM to approve remittances, and approvals 
are fairly automatic as long as the applicant\'s accounts 
have been audited and sufficient foreign exchange is 
available. Businesspeople report no major problems with 
foreign currency remittances.  Traditionally, foreign 
exchange availability follows the agricultural cycle in 
Malawi.  It is plentiful from April through September (when 
tobacco sales generate foreign exchange inflows), and scarce 
from October through March.  During periods of scarcity, 
investors may not have immediate access to foreign exchange. 
As of December 2004, official foreign reserves equaled 
approximately 2.0 months of import cover. Non official 
reserves totaled 1.2 months of import cover. 
3. Expropriation and Compensation 
A.  Malawi\'s constitution prohibits deprivation of an 
individual\'s property without due compensation.  There are 
effective laws that protect both local and foreign 
investment.  The likelihood of expropriatory actions has 
been extremely remote since the repeal of the forfeiture act 
in 1992.  Although public tenders for the sale of shares of 
state-owned enterprises often encourage local participation, 
foreign investors tend to dominate the share-holding of 
large MSE-listed companies requiring significant technical 
and financial resources. 
 
B.  The Land Reform Commission -- which the Government 
established in 1996 to review land tenure and establish a 
new land reform program -- presented its final report to the 
President in November 1999.  In January 2002, the Ministry 
of Lands published a new land policy.  Draft legislation is 
being prepared, and the new law will likely incorporate many 
recommendations of the Commission\'s report, including the 
abolition of freehold tenure (owners holding permanent 
title) and the conversion of all freehold titles to 
leasehold (owners holding land on lease for a maximum period 
of 99 years.)  As of July 2000, the Malawi Government 
stopped issuing freehold land. 
 
C.  At present, the Government may employ land acquisition 
procedures set forth in the Land Acquisition Act of 1971. 
According to this Act, the government must justify its 
acquisition as being in the public interest and must pay 
fair market value for the land.  Fair market value is 
assessed by summing the amount the owner originally paid for 
the land, the value of any permanent improvements that 
increase the productive capacity, utility or amenity of the 
land, and any appreciation of the land value.  If the 
private landowner objects to the level of compensation, he 
may obtain an independent assessment of the land value. 
According to the Act, however, such cases may not be 
challenged in court; the Ministry of Lands, Housing, 
Physical Planning, and Surveys remains the final judge. 
Most land in Malawi is leasehold. 
 
4. Dispute Settlement 
 
A.  Malawi has an independent but overburdened judiciary, 
which derives its procedures from English Common Law.  There 
has been little government interference in the court system, 
although there have on occasion been allegations of 
government involvement -- largely through public comments 
made by politicians on certain cases.  There are also 
frequent allegations of bribery in civil and criminal cases. 
Administration of the courts is weak, and due process can be 
very slow.  Serious shortcomings in the judicial system 
include poor record keeping, a lack of attorneys and trained 
personnel, heavy caseloads, and insufficient financial 
resources. 
 
B.  The court system in Malawi accepts and enforces foreign 
court judgments that are registered in accordance with 
established legal procedure.  There are, however, reciprocal 
agreements among Commonwealth countries to enforce judgments 
without this registration obligation.  There is no such 
agreement between Malawi and the United States. 
 
C.  Malawi has legislation that offers adequate protection 
for property and contractual rights.  Malawi has written 
commercial laws, which codify Common Law.  The Sale-Of-Goods 
Act, the Hire-Purchase Act, and the Competition and Fair 
Trading Act cover commercial practices.  The first two Acts 
have been consistently applied, and there is a track record 
of cases involving commercial law.  There is also a written 
and consistently applied Bankruptcy Law based on Common Law. 
Under Bankruptcy Law, secured creditors -- rank-ordered 
based upon investment registration dates -- have first 
priority in recovering money.  Monetary judgments are 
usually made in the investor\'s currency.  However, the 
immediate availability of foreign exchange is dependent upon 
supply, which varies on a seasonal basis. 
 
D.  Malawi is a member of the International Center for 
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and accepts 
binding international arbitration of investment disputes 
between foreign investors and the state if specified in a 
written contract.  There have been no investment disputes 
involving U.S. Companies since 1996. 
 
5. Performance Requirements/Incentives 
 
A.  Malawi is not in compliance with WTO Trade Related 
Investment Measures (TRIM) notification requirements. 
However, Malawi does not set performance requirements for 
establishing, maintaining or expanding an investment.  Nor 
does it place requirements on ownership, source of 
financing, or geographic location.  The Government accords 
export promotion zone (EPZ) status only to firms (foreign or 
domestic) that produce exclusively for export. 
 
B.  Malawi offers the following incentives, which apply 
equally to domestic and foreign investors: 
 
- a corporate tax rate of 35% 
- the following tax allowances: 
  -- 40% for new buildings and machinery 
  -- up to 20% for used buildings and machinery 
  -- 100% deduction for manufacturing company operating 
expenses in 2 years prior to start of business 
  -- no withholding tax on dividends; 
  -- no import duty on raw materials for manufacturing 
industry (N.B.  This policy is being implemented at the 
discretion of the Customs and Excise Department.  Several 
manufacturers have recently complained of delays and denial 
of this incentive.) 
  -- no import duty on computer equipment and accessories 
  -- tax holidays or reduced corporate tax for some new 
investments 
  -- a maximum import tariff rate of 25% 
 
C.  Malawi offers the following special incentives for 
exporters: 
 
- for exporters in EPZs: 
  -- no corporate tax, value added tax, or withholding tax 
on dividends 
  -- no import duty on capital equipment and raw materials; 
and 
  -- no excise taxes on local purchases of raw materials and 
packaging 
 
- for industries manufacturing in bond: 
  -- an allowance of 12% of export revenues for products 
other than tobacco, tea, sugar and coffee 
  -- transport allowance of 25% of all international 
transport costs 
  -- no import duties on capital equipment 
  -- no import duties or surtaxes on raw materials 
  -- no excise tax on local purchases of raw materials and 
packaging material 
 
D.  The above incentives are applied consistently.  Foreign 
investors are generally accorded national treatment.  U.S. 
and other foreign firms are able to participate in 
government/donor-financed and/or subsidized-research and 
development programs.  The following information is required 
to register and incorporate a company: name of the company, 
authorized share capital, registered office, location of 
books of accounts, address of the company secretary, and 
names of directors and shareholders. 
 
E.  Visas do not inhibit investors, but the need for 
employment permits sometimes can.  Expatriate employees (of 
both domestic and foreign businesses) who reside and work in 
Malawi must obtain temporary employment permits (TEPs). 
 
F.  The government issued a revised \"Policy Statement and 
New Guidelines for The Issuance and Renewal of [Expatriate] 
Employment Permits\" (one document) in November 1998.  The 
guidelines state that investors may employ expatriate 
personnel in areas where there is a shortage of \"suitable 
and qualified\" Malawians.  They underscored the government\'s 
desire to make TEPs readily available to expatriates, and 
mandated that processing times for TEP applications shall 
not exceed 40 working days.  The 1998 policy provides for 
two types of TEPs: 
 
- those for \"key posts\" (defined as positions of \"strategic 
importance\" in business operations) which are granted for 
the life-span of the organization; and; 
- those for \"time posts\" (defined as positions with 
contracts of three-year duration or less) which are granted 
for three-year periods and renewable once. 
 
G.  The government issues Business Residence Permits (BRPs) 
to foreign nationals who own/operate businesses in Malawi. 
BRPs are issued for five-year periods and are renewable. 
Permanent Residence Permits (PRPs) are issued to foreign 
spouses who reside permanently in Malawi, and to 
owners/operators of businesses who reside in Malawi for 
periods in excess of ten years.  PRP holders cannot work as 
employees.  Malawi\'s immigration laws governing BRPs and 
PRPs have been revised.  There are three categories of 
residence permits based on amount of investment, status of 
applicant (investor, retiree, student, spouse of a Malawi 
citizen) and period of business assignment.  The maximum 
number of resident permits per organization is five, with 
the actual number allowed dependent on the amount of 
investment. 
 
6. Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
 
The government encourages both domestic and foreign 
investors to establish and own business enterprises in most 
sectors of the economy.  All investors have the right to 
establish, acquire, and dispose of interests in business 
enterprises.  Public enterprises compete equally with 
private entities with respect to access to markets, credit 
and other business operations. 
 
7. Protection of Property Rights 
 
A.  Both foreign and domestic investors have access to 
Malawi\'s legal system, which functions fairly well, albeit 
slowly.  Malawi has laws that govern the acquisition, 
disposition, recording and protection of all property rights 
(land, buildings, etc.) as well as intellectual property 
rights (copyrights, patents and trademarks, etc.).  The 
government has signed and adheres to bilateral and 
multilateral investment guarantee treaties and key 
agreements on intellectual property rights.  Malawi is a 
member of the convention establishing the multilateral 
investment guarantee agency, the World Intellectual Property 
Organization (WIPO), the Berne Convention, and the Universal 
Copyright Convention. 
 
B.  The Copyright Society of Malawi (COSOMA), established in 
1992, administers the 1989 Copyright Act, which protects 
copyrights and \"neighboring\" rights in Malawi.  The 
Registrar General administers the Patent and Trademarks Act, 
which protects industrial intellectual property rights in 
Malawi.  A public registry of patents and patent licenses is 
kept.  Patents must be registered through an agent. 
Trademarks are registered publicly following advertisement 
and a period of no objection.  WTO rules allow Malawi, as a 
less developed country, to delay full implementation of the 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
(TRIPs) agreement until 2016.  The Ministry of Commerce and 
Industry (MCI) -- coordinator of WTO issues in Malawi -- has 
limited capacity to effectively track WTO developments. The 
MCI is working with COSOMA and the Registrar General to 
align relevant domestic legislation with the WTO TRIPs 
agreement with technical assistance from the Africa Regional 
Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO). 
 
8. Transparency of the Regulatory System 
 
A.  Malawi\'s industrial and trade reform program -- 
including rationalization of the tax system, liberalization 
of the foreign exchange regime, and elimination of trade and 
industrial licenses on several items and businesses -- has 
produced written guidelines intended to increase government 
use of transparent and effective policies to foster 
competition.  No tax, labor, environment, health and safety 
or other laws distort or impede investment.  However, 
procedural delays, red tape, and corrupt practices continue 
to impede the business and investment approval process. 
These include decision making, which is often neither 
transparent nor based purely on merit, and required land- 
access approvals.  While market prices for goods are 
generally not controlled, prices of certain other goods -- 
sugar, maize, petroleum products, and state-provided 
utilities -- are regulated. 
 
B.  There have been positive steps towards increasing 
regulatory transparency and improving the foreign investment 
environment. These developments include:  establishment of 
the National Electricity Council in October 1998; the 
establishment of the Malawi Communication Regulatory 
Authority (MACRA) in May 1999; the licensing and operation 
of a second cellular phone service provider in 1999; and the 
splitting of the former Malawi Posts and Telecommunication 
Corporation (MPTC) into the Malawi Posts Corporation (MPC) 
and Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL) as separate 
entities in May 2000.  The state-owned Petroleum Control 
Commission (PCC) relinquished its monopoly on petroleum 
imports in May 2000, allowing the private sector to import 
80% of Malawi\'s fuel.  PCC now has a largely regulatory 
function within the petroleum sector. 
9. Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
A.  The Reserve Bank of Malawi pursues a tight monetary 
policy, though a legacy of fiscal indiscipline continues to 
exert pressure on money supply.  In 2001, growth in money 
supply (m2) was 21.2%.  M2 growth was 25.2% in 2002 and 
29.3% in 2003. The new government elected in May 2004 has 
embarked on a program of expenditure control and reduction 
in new domestic borrowing. 
 
B.  With the tighter monetary policy, headline inflation 
dropped from 33.7% in January 2001 to 9% in May 2003.  It 
has since crept up again, and was at 12% in October 2004. 
Reserve Bank discount rates were reduced from 35% to 25% in 
2004. However, excessive government spending has continued 
to put inflationary pressure on the economy.  As of end 
November 2004, the kwacha was trading at approximately 109 
to the dollar. 
 
C.  The private sector in Malawi has a variety of credit 
instruments.  Credit is generally allocated on market terms. 
Foreign investors may utilize domestic credit, but proceeds 
from investments made using local resources are not 
remittable. 
 
D.  Malawi has a sound banking sector, overseen and well 
regulated by the Reserve Bank of Malawi -- its central bank. 
There are six full-service commercial banks:  First Merchant 
Bank Limited; Finance Bank of Malawi; Indefinance; National 
Bank of Malawi (NBM); Nedbank; Stanbic Bank (SB) and Loita 
Investment Bank.  Other financial institutions are: 
Investment and Development Bank of Malawi (INDEBANK); 
Investment and Development Fund of Malawi (INDEFUND); the 
Malawi Development Corporation (MDC); Finance Corporation of 
Malawi (Fincom); Leasing and Finance Company of Malawi 
(LFC); Malawi Savings Bank (MSB); the New Building Society 
(NBS); the NBS Bank; the Malawi Rural Finance Company 
(MRFC), Continental Discount House, and First Discount 
House. 
 
E.  NBM and SB, which operate on a commercial, for-profit 
basis, have dominated Malawi\'s commercial banking sector for 
the past 30 years.  As of December 2003, these banks 
controlled over 80% of the market.  Market shares for the 
remaining banks were as follows: FMB, 6.4%; FBM, 3.8%; and 
Indefinance, 2.2%. 
 
F.  The structure of the Malawi banking sector changed 
significantly in 2001 with the privatization of the Stanbic 
Bank (SB).  Standard Bank of South Africa completed its 
purchase of 60% of SB in December 2001 as part of the 
privatization program. The conglomerate Press Corporation 
Limited (PCL), in which the government holds a 49% stake, 
sold out of SB but increased its holdings in rival National 
Bank of Malawi (NBM).  PCL now owns 50.1% of NBM. 
 
G.  The Companies Act, the Capital Market Development Act 
(1990), and the Capital Market Development Regulations 
(1992) provide the legislative and regulatory framework for 
the encouragement and facilitation of portfolio investment 
in Malawi.  The attendant legal, regulatory and accounting 
systems are transparent and consistent with international 
norms.  These acts govern the Malawi Stock Exchange (MSE). 
 
H.  Stockbrokers Malawi Limited (SML) is the major 
registered stockbroker in Malawi.  SML ran the MSE under a 
three-year contract with the RBM until April 1, 2000, when 
the two split to assume separate roles of broker and 
regulator, respectively.  Two new brokerage firms, 
Continental Discount House and First Discount House, began 
operations in 2001 and 2002, respectively.  The MSE remains 
regulated by the Stock Exchange Commission. 
 
I.  SML runs a secondary market in government securities, 
and both local and foreign investors have equal access to 
the purchase of these securities.  The following nine 
companies are listed on the MSE: NICO, Blantyre Hotels 
Limited (BHL), Sugar Corporation of Malawi (SUCOMA), Stanbic 
Bank ( Malawi) Packaging Industries of Malawi (PIM), Press 
Corporation Limited (PCL), Old Mutual, Sunbird  and National 
Bank of Malawi (NBM).  As at December 17, 2004, 6.716 
billion shares were in issue on the MSE, and the market 
capitalization was MK 745.186  billion (USD 6.84 billion). 
Other potential companies for listing on the SME include 
Bata Shoe Company, Leopard Match Company Limited, Malawi 
Insurance Brokers Limited, Manica Freight Services Limited 
and Bain Hogg Insurance Limited.  Malawi and other SADC 
markets are taking steps to harmonize listing requirements 
through the SADC stock exchange co-operation initiative. 
 
J.  The MSE\'s development is still in its nascent stage, and 
hostile takeovers have not yet occurred.  Apart from the 
restrictions under the privatization program, the U.S. 
Embassy in Malawi is not aware of any specific measures 
taken by private firms to restrict foreign investment or 
participation.  Foreign investors tend to be the dominant 
shareholders in large MSE-listed companies requiring 
significant technical and financial resources.  The 
Competition and Fair Trading Act will not cover the day-to- 
day trading on the MSE, but will regulate mergers, 
acquisitions, and takeovers that are of national interest. 
 
10. Political Violence 
 
A.  Malawi has been largely free of political violence since 
gaining independence in 1964.  Apart from the disarming of 
the paramilitary group, the Malawi Young Pioneers, incidents 
of violence associated with Malawi\'s 1994 transition to 
democracy were few.  Sporadic incidents of violence occurred 
at political rallies in late 1998.  The 1999 presidential 
and parliamentary election campaigns were largely free of 
political violence, but there were limited incidents of post- 
election violence (primarily small-scale property damage) in 
June 1999 and in by-elections in Blantyre in June 2001. 
Sporadic violence in the run-up to the 2004 elections, and 
in the days immediately following the elections, also 
occurred. 
 
B.  Incidents of labor unrest occasionally occur, but these 
are usually tame affairs.  There are, however, no nascent 
insurrections, belligerent neighbors, or other politically 
motivated activities of major concern to investors. 
 
11. Corruption 
 
A.  There are serious incidences/allegations of corruption, 
particularly in the area of customs and excise tax and 
government procurement.  The Corrupt Practices Act, revised 
in 2004, provides the legal framework for combating 
corruption in Malawi. 
 
B.  The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) is legally mandated to 
investigate corruption in Malawi.  Opened in 1997 and fully 
staffed in 1998, the ACB has thus far brought forward a 
number of high-level cases involving former cabinet-level 
officials and senior members of the ruling party, among 
others.   During the presidency of Bakili Muluzi, the ACB 
had difficulties getting cases prosecuted through the 
politically appointed Director of Public Prosecutions; these 
difficulties have in large part disappeared since the 
election of President Bingu wa Mutharika in May 2004.   The 
new administration has brought a change of leadership to the 
ACB and prioritized the prosecution of corrupt practices. 
 
C.  Malawi subscribes to the provisions of the OECD 
Convention on Combating Bribery, but is not a signatory to 
the Convention.  Malawi\'s Penal Code prohibits bribery. 
Giving or receiving a bribe -- whether to or from a Malawian 
or foreign official -- is a crime under section 90 of 
Malawi\'s penal code.  Accordingly, bribes are not tax 
deductible. 
 
12. Bilateral Investment Agreements 
 
A.  Malawi\'s policy is to negotiate bilateral investment 
treaties with countries whose nationals opt to invest in 
Malawi.  The United States-Malawi Double Taxation Agreement 
from the colonial period was canceled by the United States 
in 1983.  To date, there is neither a bilateral investment 
nor a taxation treaty.  There have been no taxation issues 
of concern to U.S. investors since 1996. 
 
B.  Malawi acceded to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee 
Agency (MIGA) in 1985/86.  Since MIGA provides mechanisms 
for the settlement of investment disputes, Malawi has not 
renewed several investment treaties that lapsed after 1986. 
However, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, South 
Africa, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland still maintain Double 
Taxation Treaties with Malawi. 
 
 
13. OPIC and Other Insurance Programs 
 
Malawi has had an OPIC investment guarantee agreement since 
1967.  In August 1999 the U.S. Export-Import Bank included 
Malawi under its new Africa Short-term Export Credit 
Insurance Program. 
14. Labor 
A.  The Government of Malawi estimates that more than half 
of the population is of working age. Unskilled labor is 
plentiful; skilled labor is scarce.  Occupational categories 
with skills shortages include accountants and related 
personnel; economists; engineers; primary and secondary 
school teachers; lawyers; and medical and health personnel. 
The University of Malawi provides bachelors and masters 
degrees in economics, engineering, medicine, education, 
agriculture and administration.  The Malawi College of 
Accountancy teaches accounting.  Chancellor College operates 
the country\'s law school.  In early 1999, the government 
established the Technical, Entrepreneurial and Vocational 
Education and Training (TEVET) program to address technical 
skills shortages in industry. 
 
B.  The Labor Relations Act (LRA) governs labor-relations 
management in Malawi.  It was signed into law in June 1996, 
and entered into force on December 1, 1997.  The Act allows 
strikes and lockouts for registered workers and employers 
after dispute settlement procedures in collective agreements 
and conciliation have failed.  As democracy and trade union 
rights have existed only since 1994, industrial relations 
are still evolving.  Employers, labor unions, and government 
generally lack sufficient knowledge of their legitimate 
roles in labor relations/disputes. 
 
C.  Workers have the legal right to form and join trade 
unions.  As of November 2003, 26 unions were registered. 
Union membership is low, however, given the small percentage 
of the work force in the formal sector (about 12%), the lack 
of awareness of worker rights and benefits, and a resistance 
on the part of many employees to join unions.  Only 13% of 
people employed in the formal sector belong to unions. 
Unions may form or join federations, and have the right to 
affiliate with and participate in the affairs of 
international workers\' organizations.  While the government 
is a signatory to the ILO Convention protecting worker 
rights, mechanisms for enforcing the provisions of the 
convention are weak.  There are serious manpower shortages 
at the Ministry of Labor, resulting in almost no labor- 
standards inspections. 
 
15. Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
 
Legislation for the establishment of export promotion zones 
(EPZs) came into force in December 1995.  All companies 
engaged exclusively in manufacture for export may apply for 
EPZ status.  As of November 2004, Malawi had approved 21 
firms for EPZ status, of which 17 were operational and four 
had closed operations.  A manufacturing under bond (MUB) 
scheme offers slightly less attractive incentives to 
companies that export some, but not all, of their 
manufactures.

SUBJECT: A PLOT TO KILL MALAWI\'S PRESIDENT? 
 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified--not for Internet 
distribution. 
 
1.  (SBU) Three United Democratic Front officials were 
charged with treason on Wednesday for carrying guns to a 
meeting with President Bingu wa Mutharika. The Attorney 
General said authorities had information that some 
politicians had plotted to kill the president on January 2, 
2004.  By Thursday afternoon, reports indicated that charges 
had been dropped against the men.  President Mutharika, 
however, held a press conference this afternoon, in which, 
according to journalists present, he charged that the plot 
was real, that it was organized by the UDF, and that former 
President Muluzi had full knowledge of it.  The charges 
against Muluzi were not carried in the first broadcast 
reports carried on Government radio.  Mutharika is said to 
be temporarily closing the National Intelligence Bureau in 
response to poor intelligence on the incident.  The press 
conference has not yet been broadcast.   The closure of NIB 
is partly motivated by the widely held perception that the 
NIB is loyal principally to former President Muluzi, its 
creator. 
 
2.  (U) The three officials, Deputy Transport Minister Roy 
Commsy, former Cabinet Minister Harry Thomson and Member of 
Parliament Alfred Mwechumu, were on their way to a 
reconciliation meeting between the President and senior UDF 
officials aligned with former President Bakili Muluzi. 
After the arrests on gun charges, the police released the 
three on bail, then re-arrested them for treason several 
hours later.  Two of the men were remanded into custody and 
later released when the charges were dropped, while one of 
the men has been admitted to a local hospital for a diabetic 
condition.   The UDF explained that the guns were licensed 
and that the politicians routinely carried them as a matter 
of personal security.  The party\'s spokesman confirmed 
reports that the UDF is seriously reconsidering its 
relationship with the President and the government.  For his 
part, Mutharika has reportedly announced that he will not 
press treason charges against the three. 
 
3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Whether or not there was actually a plot 
to assassinate the President, and whether or not treason was 
actually committed, the events of the past several days are 
another indication that the rift between Mutharika and 
Muluzi is worsening.  Recent incidents of physical 
intimidation, mainly by Muluzi loyalists (to be reported 
septel), are an indication at least that passions are 
running high.  Muluzi loyalists appear not to have the 
political support to threaten the Government seriously, and 
Mutharika has been content up to now to deal with them one 
by one, mostly through his anti-corruption campaign.  But 
the increasing intensity of the disagreements between the 
two sides appears to be peaking, with Mutharika finally 
charging UDF in public.  Whether this will result in 
criminal charges, or whether Muluzi will respond with 
something still more dramatic, remains to be seen. In any 
case, it is clear that the old guard will not go quietly.

SUBJECT: UDF PARTY FRAGMENTATION LEADS TO VIOLENCE, 
INTIMIDATION 
 
REF: A. 03 LILONGWE 728 
 
     B. LILONGWE 15 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY.  The expanding rift (reftel A) between 
President Mutharika and former President Muluzi, now chairman 
of the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF), has recently 
been punctuated by sporadic violence, allegedly by the 
UDF-affiliated Young Democrats.  Members of the UDF known to 
be allied with Mutharika have been harassed and had their 
party-owned vehicles stolen in confrontations with old-guard 
party loyalist thugs, and the recent arrests for treason 
(reftel B) have increased the UDF\'s rhetoric against the 
current government.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   (U) On January 2, allegedly with the blessing of UDF 
leadership, a group of Young Democrats confiscated a party 
vehicle from a UDF official thought to be on the Mutharika 
side of the political division.  A district governor was 
reportedly beaten up in the incident, which occurred at 
Muluzi\'s home.  The Young Democrats unsuccessfully attempted 
to retrieve several other vehicles.  The vehicle was later 
returned to the regional governor, and UDF party officials 
have publicly dismissed the incident as theft. 
 
3.  (U) On January 5, a deputy minister was harassed by the 
Young Democrats because his nephew is an independent 
political candidate in the upcoming bi-elections.  The 
nephew\'s election would weaken the UDF\'s position in 
Parliament, thus strengthening the influence of Mutharika. 
Another UDF governor was attacked at a Mutharika rally in the 
area on the same day. The perpetrators, presumed to be Young 
Democrats, were later arrested. 
 
4.  (U) Late in 2003, a UDF cabinet minister was verbally 
harassed and threatened because of his alliance with 
Mutharika.  The minister, previously held in high regard by 
the UDF, was not injured but has clearly alienated the UDF 
old-guard.  In an effort to distance himself from the 
incident, Muluzi denounced such acts and offered a public 
apology. 
 
4.  (SBU) COMMENT.  Though the UDF has no shortage of 
political foes, it has obviously turned on itself.  The 
incidents above illustrate just how deep the division between 
party and government has gone.  Fueled by the President\'s 
anti-corruption drive and determination not to provide 
financial and political support to the party, fundamental 
disagreements between the two sides have caused each to lash 
out at the other, though in markedly different ways.  The UDF 
(also known as the Muluzi side), unable to discern where 
party influence in governing the country ends, has reverted 
to some of its old tactics of intimidation and thuggery, even 
if on a petty level.  The government, or Mutharika side, has 
responded by reducing its political dependence on the UDF and 
acting independently.  Mutharika\'s continued assertion that 
party and government are not necessarily one and the same has 
apparently left Muluzi frustrated, surrounded by an 
ever-dwindling circle of allies.  In reaction, Muluzi is 
taking more extreme measures.  Ironically, Muluzi\'s 
propensity for extra-legal actions may make it easier, both 
politically and legally, for Mutharika to neutralize Muluzi\'s 
persistent grip on power.

1.(SBU) Summary and Introduction: After a week of high 
political drama, including an alleged assassination attempt, 
the dissolution of Malawi\'s pro-Muluzi intelligence service, 
and the arrest on treason charges and subsequent pardon of 
three Muluzi loyalists, Malawians now seem to believe that 
the rift between President Mutharika and his predecessor, UDF 
Party Chairman Bakili Muluzi, is now insurmountable (Ref. B). 
 While the public internecine wrangling may have damaged 
Mutharika\'s presidential image, it has also cleared the air: 
Mutharika is in charge and clearly in control of the 
machinery of state.  Without making predictions, this cable 
describes some of the challenges Mutharika faces as he moves 
forward to consolidate his presidency and advance his 
pro-growth, good-government agenda, as well as outlining 
possible scenarios that could play out over the coming 
months. 
2.(SBU) A permanent rift in the UDF now seems inevitable, as 
Mutharika has declared that he can and will govern 
independently of Muluzi and his political machine.  Muluzi\'s 
UDF may form a marriage of convenience with John Tembo\'s MCP 
to support the latter\'s court case seeking to nullify last 
year\'s presidential election on grounds of voter fraud. 
Tembo could prevail, especially if those who perpetrated the 
fraud provide evidence in court, resulting in a call for new 
elections.  At that point, Mutharika would have to create a 
party, possibly resurrecting his defunct United Party (UP). 
Muluzi would be free to run as the UDF candidate, since 
Mutharika\'s interregnum would permit Muluzi to obviate the 
constitutional prohibition against serving more than two 
consecutive terms.  Muluzi still enjoys strong support in the 
rural areas, especially the south, and could return as 
president.  Mutharika\'s options: continue to govern without 
the support of Muluzi\'s UDF, delay the court case as long as 
possible, rebuild his own party after eventually splitting 
with the UDF, and weaken the UDF machine by starving it of 
its government sources of revenue.  End Summary and 
Introduction. 
 
-------- 
The Rift 
-------- 
 
3. (U) Following President Mutharika\'s announcement last week 
of an alleged assassination plot, editorials Friday and over 
the weekend have largely praised the President for standing 
up to Muluzi and the UDF.  The Daily Times praised the 
President\'s willingness to acknowledge in public the 
widely-held truth that Muluzi does not want to relinquish 
power; it was less than sanguine, however, about his 
\"pardons\" of three UDF treason defendants before they were 
tried and convicted.  The Nation: \"Malawians thought Bingu 
was a coward.  He is not.\" 
 
4. (SBU) Muluzi denied any involvement in the alleged 
assassination plot, and struck back by threatening to 
\"discipline\" eight senior UDF officials loyal to Mutharika. 
Mutharika claimed he now would only reenter reconciliation 
talks with Muluzi if the UDF were to remove four of his 
closest political confidantes and UDF co-founders: John 
Chikakwiya (Mayor of Blantyre), Dumbo Lemani (ex-minister of 
mines), Humphrey Mvula (ex-president of parastatal Shire bus 
lines) and Friday Jumbe (ex-minister of finance).  All four 
have been accused of corruption and three are currently under 
indictment, but few here believe that Muluzi will remove them 
from the party (Ref. C).  Meanwhile, National Police and 
Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) officials began seizing UDF 
vehicles for non-payment of duty on December 7.  While the 
UDF was granted a preliminary injunction over the weekend, 
the MRA will likely move to lift the stay and continue the 
seizures in the coming week (Ref. A).  (Note: Muluzi 
personally holds title to over one hundred bright-yellow UDF 
four-by-four and luxury vehicles he imported duty-free while 
president and never registered.  They have been passed out as 
political perks to UDF/Muluzi loyalists, and several have 
been violently seized recently by the militant, pro-Muluzi 
Young Democrats from politicians seen as too close to 
Mutharika.  End Note.) 
 
---------- 
What Next? 
---------- 
 
5. (SBU) The events of the past week have clearly shown that 
President Mutharika is in charge, and government institutions 
are following his orders.  While the political situation here 
is extremely fluid, significant challenges lie ahead for 
President Mutharika.  Most here now consider the 
Muluzi/Mutharika rift in the UDF to be insurmountable.  While 
many in the UDF are pro-Mutharika, none here believes that 
Muluzi will give up his position as party chairman 
voluntarily, and few think Mutharika will be able to wrest 
control of the UDF from him.  Muluzi personally owns all UDF 
vehicles, all of its real property and the business interests 
that provide it funding--including the KEZA building which he 
built and leased to the Malawi Revenue Authority while still 
President.  (Note: The MRA was ordered to vacate the KEZA 
building in November and its director was removed.  End 
Note).  The UDF still functions as a machine for the 
distribution of wealth and political influence--even if both 
have waned considerably since Mutharika\'s inauguration--and 
Muluzi still controls it. 
 
6.(SBU) While Mutharika has concentrated on sidelining 
Muluzi\'s inner circle through corruption prosecutions, he has 
not investigated Muluzi himself.  This may become an 
increasingly appealing option for Mutharika once he has 
abandoned any hope for reconciling the split in the UDF, 
although it is not without risk: any arrest or indictment of 
Muluzi would significantly raise the ante for political 
violence by Young Democrats, who in the current climate have 
already begun beating and harassing pro-Mutharika 
politicians, including one sitting cabinet minister (Ref. A). 
 Mutharika may have deferred pursuing Muluzi on corruption 
charges because of the UDF complaints that his 
anti-corruption efforts constitute de facto political 
persecution.  Short of indicting Muluzi, the President will 
be able to weaken Muluzi and the UDF by cutting off their 
various sources of funding.  The seizing of Muluzi\'s UDF 
vehicles is an indication that the President has already 
begun that process: Muluzi will not likely be able pay the 
100 percent duty and registration fees to recover the 
vehicles, given their number and value.  The nullification of 
the lease contract between MRA and Muluzi for the KEZA 
building terminated a major source of funding to the Party. 
Given that Muluzi is already liquidating assets to pay 
outstanding personal judgments, it is doubtful that he will 
be able to continue to fund the UDF without direct inflows 
from the government.  Even with these measures it will not be 
easy for Mutharika to sideline Muluzi from the UDF and take 
over.  The Party exists to promote the political and personal 
fortunes of Muluzi and his cohort, and Mutharika is viewed as 
an outside technocrat imposed by Muluzi on the party. 
 
--------------------------- 
Crossing the Floor Over You 
--------------------------- 
 
7.(SBU) Mutharika could simply abandon the UDF.  Under 
Malawi\'s mixed presidential/parliamentary constitution, 
Malawian presidents are directly elected, and theoretically 
should remain president regardless of party affiliation.  The 
UDF would certainly contest Mutharika\'s ability to remain 
President if he leaves the Party, since its current rhetoric 
is that the Party (read Muluzi) is superior to any president 
elected with its support.  While this position would not 
prevail legally, it would be a nuisance and another battle 
for public opinion that Mutharika will need to handle 
carefully.  Under this scenario, Mutharika will likely form 
another party, possibly reviving his United Party (UP) and 
taking loyalists with him.  All current UDF Ministers would 
likely go with the President--if only to hold on to their 
jobs--including some percentage of UDF MPs.  It is impossible 
to say how many would depart UDF: much will depend on the 
perception of who is ascendant in the Muluzi-Mutharika 
struggle.  Some UDF MPs clearly support Mutharika\'s 
good-governance and economic growth platform, while most are 
watching the political winds. 
 
8.(SBU) In a ploy to prevent parliamentary defections, 
Muluzi\'s UDF successfully amended the Malawi Constitution to 
include Section 65, which penalizes MPs with the loss of 
their seats for switching parties.  This rule has been 
finessed to permit MPs to switch from a declared party 
affiliation to independent status, or vice versa (they may 
run as independents and later declare a party affiliation). 
This would create for more high political drama, but would 
not necessarily prevent Mutharika from cobbling together a 
coalition of ex-UDF independents and existing parties 
sufficient to be able to govern effectively.  Malawi\'s system 
of government is heavily weighted towards the executive, and 
Mutharika can rule without legislative approval for many of 
his initiatives if necessary, but he will need a block of 
legislative support in order to effectively govern. 
 
-------------------------- 
Muluzi Back in the Saddle? 
-------------------------- 
 
9.(SBU) Once the split with Mutharika is permanent, as many 
believe it is, Muluzi would have every incentive to encourage 
UDF members such as Lemani, Mvula and Jumbe to testify or 
otherwise provide evidence in MCP Presidential candidate John 
Tembo\'s legal case to nullify last year\'s election results 
(Ref. D).  They have already made claims in the media that 
they were personally involved in widespread election fraud to 
ensure a Mutharika victory.  Tembo was Banda\'s heir in the 
MCP, and he and Muluzi are bitter political enemies dating 
back to the 1994 elections.  Still, they may cooperate in the 
lawsuit for the purposes of removing Mutharika and staging 
new elections, which both believe they would win.  There 
would be a risk of prosecution for Lemani and others who 
incriminate themselves, but the payoff would be worth the 
risk: in a new election, Muluzi could run as the UDF 
candidate and return to the presidency.  Muluzi still enjoys 
a broad base of support among rural Malawians, especially in 
the south, and others who remember the Muluzi years of 
profligate government spending with some nostalgia.  Legally, 
the Constitution only bars presidents from seeking more than 
two consecutive terms, and Mutharika\'s interregnum would 
effectively permit a third Muluzi term, although this would 
certainly be contested.  Mutharika\'s best defense will be the 
same of any sitting Malawian President confronted by an 
election-fraud case: use dilatory tactics, gentle suasion and 
any other means possible to prevent the case from coming to 
trial for as long as possible. 
 
10. (SBU) Comment: Muluzi may have chosen unwisely in 
selecting Mutharika as his successor.  Mutharika, a 
technocrat and former IMF official, has diligently set about 
the work of returning fiscal discipline to government, 
combating corruption and promoting economic growth in Malawi. 
 Mutharika\'s anticorruption efforts have targeted the most 
powerful figures in his own party, except Muluzi, who are 
also widely recognized to have been the most corrupt members 
of the last government.  The effort is laudable, but the 
Muluzi machine will not go without a fight in the courts, the 
media, and as is being proven by the return of the Young 
Democrats to active thuggery--in the streets.   Malawi\'s 
neopaternalistic political structure favors the executive, 
and it is difficult for either the legislative or judicial 
branches to pose an effective counterweight to executive 
power, as when Muluzi\'s bid to amend the Constitution to 
permit a third term was defeated.   Barring the unlikely 
event of a coup or a successful assassination attempt, the 
balance of power clearly rests with Mutharika, a situation 
that will only become more pronounced with time.  Most here 
now believe the President\'s account that Muluzi plotted to 
have him assassinated last week.  Mutharika successfully 
outmanouvered him, probably with the help of officials within 
the disbanded National Intelligence Bureau, and this may 
signal the beginning of the end of Muluzi\'s political 
influence.  The irony is that Mutharika may have to resort to 
less than democratic means to consolidate his power, hold on 
to the presidency and advance his agenda in the face of 
continued opposition from the still-powerful UDF machine that 
sponsored him, which clearly will not go without a fight.
