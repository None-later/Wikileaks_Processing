FOLLOWS. 
 
2.  THE APPEAL PROCEDURE CONTINUED IN 1989 FOR THE FIVE 
DEFENDANTS SENTENCED TO HANG FOR THE MAY 15, 1988, 
BOMBINGS AT THE ACROPOLE HOTEL AND THE SUDAN CLUB, WHICH 
TOOK SEVEN LIVES.  ON SEPTEMBER 25, SUDAN\'S DEPUTY CHIEF 
JUSTICE ABDUL MONFIM AL NAHAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE CHARGE 
IN THE CASE WOULD BE CHANGED FROM SECTION 252 OF SUDAN\'S 
PENAL CODE TO SECTION 251 (REF C).  THIS CHANGE COULD 
PERMIT THE DEFENDANTS TO ESCAPE THE DEATH PENALTY IF THE 
VICTIMS\' KIN ACCEPTED COMPENSATION (DIA) FROM THE GUILTY 
PARTIES.  IN OCTOBER THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE 
KIN OF THE VICTIMS (FIVE BRITISH AND TWO SUDANESE) WOULD 
BE ASKED TO INDICATE BEFORE JANUARY 3, 1990, WHETHER THEY 
WOULD PARDON THE MURDERERS, WITH OR WITHOUT COMPENSATION 
(REF B).  IF THE KIN DID NOT RESPOND OR REFUSED PARDON, 
THE COURT WOULD ORDER THE EXECUTIONS. 
 
3.  THE PLO MAINTAINS A CAMP NEAR SUDAN\'S RED SEA COAST 
FOR FIGHTERS EVACUATED FROM LEBANON IN 1982.  IN 1989 
THIS CAMP MAINTAINED ITS PREVIOUS LEVELS OF SIZE AND 
ACTIVITY.  THE GOVERNMENT OBSERVES ACTIVITY AT THE CAMP 
CLOSELY. 
 
4.  THE GOVERNMENT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 1989 IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORIST 
ISSUE.

SUBJECT:  GOS RELEASES SADIQ, MOHAMMED OSMAN AND TURABI 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  THE GOS RELEASED NOVEMBER 17 THE DETAINED 
LEADERS OF ALL POLITICAL PARTIES EXCEPT THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY.  GENERAL OMAR AL-BASHIR TOLD PRESIDENT CARTER THAT 
ONLY FOURTEEN POLITICAL PRISONERS ARE STILL DETAINED.  WE 
ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF POLITICAL DETAINEES, MOSTLY 
UNIONISTS AND SUSPECTED COMMUNISTS, HAVE DECLINED 
SUBSTANTIALLY TO ABOUT 150.  THE RELEASES APPARENTLY ARE 
PART OF AN ONGOING EFFORT TOWARD NATIONAL RECONCILIATION 
THAT SEEKS TO BROADEN THE BASE OF THE GOVERNMENT.  SEPTEL 
WILL INCLUDE NAMES AND BIOS OF ALL DETAINEES.  THE 
FOLLOWING ARE ONLY THE MOST PROMINENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  PARTY LEADERS RELEASED ON NOVEMBER 17 INCLUDE: 
 
-- SADIQ AL MAHDI OF THE UMMA PARTY.  SADIQ WAS PRIME 
MINISTER FROM 1986 UNTIL THE JUNE 30 COUP; 
 
-- MOHAMMAD OSMAN AL MIRGHANI, LEADER DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST 
PARTY (DUP).  MOHAMMAD OSMAN IS ALSO RELIGIOUS LEADER OF 
THE KHATMIYYA RELIGIOUS SECT; 
 
-- HASSAN AL-TURABI OF THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF); 
TURABI SERVED AS MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ATTORNEY 
GENERAL/MINISTER OF JUSTICE UNDER SADIQ FROM JULY 1988 TO 
MARCH 1989.  TURABI\'S PARTY WAS IN OPPOSITION AT THE TIME 
OF THE COUP; 
 
-- ELIABA JAMES SUROUR OF THE PROGRESSIVE PEOPLES PARTY 
(PPP), AN EQUATORIAN-BASED PARTY.  SUROR SERVED AS 
OPPOSITION LEADER IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY FROM JULY 
1988 TO APRIL 1989.  A PROMINENT SOUTHERN POLITICIAN, HE 
ALSO HEADED A SOUTHERN OPPOSITION ALLIANCE, THE UNITED 
SOUTHERN AFRICAN PARTY (USAP); 
 
-- SAMUEL ARU BOL OF THE SOUTHERN SUDAN POLITICAL 
ASSOCIATION (SSPA), A DINKA-BASED PARTY FORMED IN 1985. 
ARU BOL HEADED A PRO-SPLM FACTION THAT OPPOSED SADIQ 
UNTIL APRIL 1989. 
 
3.  GENERAL OMAR AL-BASHIR TOLD VISITING FORMER PRESIDENT 
CARTER THAT ONLY FOURTEEN POLITICAL PRISONERS REMAINED 
DETAINED, WE ASSUME AFTER THE RELEASE OF THESE 
DETAINEES.  THIS NUMBER, HOWEVER, PROBABLY DOES NOT 
INCLUDE MANY UNIONISTS AND PERSONS OFFICIALLY 
UNAFFILIATED WITH A PARTY WHO COULD BE CONSIDERED 
POLITICAL DETAINEES.  WE ESTIMATE THAT THE NUMBER OF 
THESE DETAINEES HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST TWO 
MONTHS TO ABOUT 150 (FROM OVER 400). 
 
4.  FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER MOHAMMED TEWFIQ (DUP) AND 
SADIQ\'S WIFE SARRA AL-FADIL AL-MAHDI ARE AMONG A NUMBER 
OF OTHER POLITICIANS RELEASED (SEPTEL). 
 
5.  THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH THE SUDAN COMMUNIST PARTY (SCP) 
REMAIN IN PRISON, INCLUDING SCP CHIEF MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM 
NUGUD, AL-TIJANI AL-TAYEB, AND JOSEPH MODESTO.  ALL 
SOUTHERN POLITICIANS HAVE NOW BEEN RELEASED EXCEPT 
MODESTO AND YOHANNES AKOL (A FORMER MEMBER OF THE 
ASSEMBLY AND LAM AKOL\'S BROTHER).  PROMINENT NONCOMMUNIST 
POLITICIANS STILL DETAINED INCLUDE FORMER FOREIGN AND 
INTERIOR MINISTER SID AHMED AL-HUSSEIN (DUP SECRETARY 
GENERAL AND VERY ANTI-NIF), FORMER FINANCE, ENERGY AND 
INFORMATION MINISTER BASHIR OMER (UMMA), FORMER STATE 
COUNCIL MEMBER IDRIS AL-BANNA (UMMA) AND OSMAN OMER 
AL-SHARIF (DUP). 
 
6.  COMMENT.  FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER\'S VISIT TO KHARTOUM 
NOVEMBER 17-18 PROBABLY PLAYED A ROLE IN THE TIMING OF 
THE LONG-RUMORED RELEASES OF POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS. 
THE RELEASES APPEAR TO BE PART OF AN ONGOING EFFORT BY 
THE RCC TOWARD DEFUSING OPPOSITION AND BROADENING THEIR 
BASE OF SUPPORT.  THE PARTY LEADERS WERE APPARENTLY 
RELEASED UNCONDITIONALLY AFTER PARTY REPRESENTATIVES 
SIGNED A DOCUMENT SUPPORTING GOS EFFORTS TOWARD NATIONAL 
RECONICILIATION.  MANY SUDANESE BELIEVE A CABINET 
RESHUFFLE BRINGING DUP, UMMA AND NIF MEMBERS INTO THE 
GOVERNMENT MAY BE IN THE CARDS.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  AT THIS TIME, LIBYAN PRESENCE IN SUDAN IS DIFFICULT 
TO ESTIMATE PRECISELY, BUT OVERT LIBYAN OPERATIONS APPEAR 
LIMITED.  LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES (LAA) FLIES TO KHARTOUM 
FROM TRIPOLI ONCE A WEEK AND MAINTAINS A SMALL KHARTOUM 
STAFF.  THE LIBYAN ARAB FOREIGN INVESTMENT CO. (LAFICO) 
AND THE LIBYAN SUDANESE CO. (LASCO), BOTH HOLDING 
COMPANIES, ALSO MAINTAIN OFFICES IN KHARTOUM.  LAFICO 
BEGAN OPERATIONS ABOUT 1981 AND LASCO ABOUT 1985; BOTH 
HAVE LITTLE OVERT ACTIVITY.  IN ADDITION, THE LIBYAN-ARAB 
HOLDING CO., A FRONT ORGANIZATION WHOSE OVERT ACTIVITIES 
INVOLVE AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENTS, HAS A KHARTOUM BRANCH. 
LIBYAN-SUDANESE ECONOMIC AND TRADE RELATIONS ARE DETAILED 
IN REF B.  AS STATED IN REF D, LIBYA IS NOW SUDAN\'S ONLY 
RELIABLE SOURCE OF PETROLEUM AND THE ONLY COUNTRY WILLING 
TO SELL TO THE GOS ON CREDIT, FOR WHICH LIBYA WILL 
INCREASINGLY DEMAND PAYMENT IN POLITICAL CURRENCY. 
 
3.  THE FRONT GROUP \"ISLAMIC CALL\" IS CONSIDERABLY MORE 
ACTIVE THAN THE LIBYAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS, WITH 
OFFICES IN THE KHARTOUM DISTRICTS OF NEW EXTENSION AND 
RIYADH.  ALTHOUGH NO DETAILS ON STAFF ARE AVAILABLE, BOTH 
OFFICES ENGAGE IN PROPAGANDA ACTIVITIES AND RECEIVE 
NUMEROUS SUDANESE VISITORS. 
 
4.  THE LIBYAN EMBASSY (CALLED THE \"LIBYAN ARAB 
BROTHERHOOD BUREAU\") IN KHARTOUM HAS AN OFFICIAL STAFF OF 
20 DIPLOMATS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE VERY UNSPECIFIC TITLES. 
THE AMBASSADOR (CALLED THE \"SECRETARY GENERAL\"), RAMADHAN 
ALI BASHIR, A DEAD RINGER FOR QADHAFI, ARRIVED JANUARY 
29.  NO BIOGRAPHIC DETAILS ON BROTHERHOOD BUREAU STAFF 
ARE AVAILABLE. 
 
5.  AMONG THE BROTHERHOOD BUREAU\'S ACTIVITIES REPORTEDLY 
IS SUPERVISION OF LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES IN SUDAN 
(REF E).  ALTHOUGH FEW DETAILS ABOUT THE OPERATIVES ARE 
AVAILABLE, THEY REPORTEDLY ARE NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE 
BECAUSE THEY RELY TOO HEAVILY ON MONEY AS AN INDUCEMENT. 
 
6.  FOR SOME YEARS LIBYA HAS MAINTAINED AN AGRICULTURAL 
PROJECT AT SAQ AL NA\'AM NEAR EL FASHER IN DARFUR WITH 10 
TO 15 LIBYAN STAFF.  THE PROJECT IS OVERTLY ENGAGED IN 
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SEED TESTING, BUT IT 
IS REPORTEDLY STAFFED BY LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES 
COMMANDED BY A COLONEL WITH A DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS LINK 
TO TRIPOLI.  THE PROJECT REPORTEDLY HAS BEEN USED TO 
FUNNEL AID TO CHADIAN REBELS IN DARFUR, ALTHOUGH NO 
LIBYAN REGULAR ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN DARFUR 
SINCE 1986.  PROVISIONS FOR INCREASED AGRICULTURAL TRADE 
BETWEEN SUDAN AND LIBYA IN RECENT AGREEMENTS SUGGEST THAT 
SUCH PROJECTS MAY BECOME MORE COMMON. 
 
7.  FEW LIBYAN MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE EVIDENT IN THE 
KHARTOUM AREA.  REPORTS SUGGEST SOME LIBYAN MILITARY 
PRESENCE IN THE WESTERN PROVINCE OF DARFUR, WHERE LIBYA 
REPORTEDLY SUPPORTS CHADIAN REBELS UNDER IDRISS DEBY. 
LIBYA ALSO MAINTAINS OFFICIAL CONTACT WITH THE SUDANESE 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.  IN ADDITION TO ITS ROLE AS SUDAN\'S 
PRINCIPAL SUPPLIER OF OIL (AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF 
WHICH GOES TO THE SUDANESE MILITARY), LIBYA HAS FOR SOME 
YEARS BEEN ONE OF SUDAN\'S MOST IMPORTANT ARMS SUPPLIERS. 
UNDER THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT OF SADIQ AL MAHDI, THE TWO 
COUNTRIES ESTABLISHED A MILITARY PROTOCOL UNDER WHICH 
LIBYA PROVIDED SUDAN WITH MIG-23 AIRCRAFT, BOMBS, 
AMMUNITION, OTHER EQUIPMENT, AND TRAINING.  LIBYAN PILOTS 
ALSO FLEW AIRSTRIKES AGAINST THE SUDAN PEOPLE\'S 
LIBERATION ARMY (SPLA), A PRACTICE NOW REPORTEDLY 
DISCONTINUED. 
 
8.  IN EARLY 1989, SOME 20 IL-76 TRANSPORT FLIGHTS 
BROUGHT MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM LIBYA TO SUDAN.  TEN SUCH 
FLIGHTS (CARRYING AMMUNITION, ROCKETS FOR USE ON 
JEEP-TYPE VEHICLES, AND BOMBS) REPORTEDLY ARRIVED IN 
KHARTOUM BETWEEN NOVEMBER 28 AND DECEMBER 5, 1989.  THESE 
FLIGHTS CONTINUE AT THE RATE OF TWO A WEEK.  SIX LIBYAN 
TECHNICIANS REPORTEDLY ARE STATIONED AT THE WADI SIEDNA 
AIRBASE TO MAINTAIN THE MIG-23\'S, AND LIBYA REPORT (#) 
A FOUR-YEAR PROGRAM OF UNITY WITH LIBYA.  THE AGREEMENT 
CALLS FOR UNIFICATION IN THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, CULTURAL, 
AND SECURITY SPHERES.  IT ALSO ALLOWS SUDANESE AND LIBYAN 
NATIONALS TO TRAVEL WITHOUT VISAS BETWEN SUDAN AND LIBYA, 
WHICH HAS PRODUCED AN UNDETERMINABLE INCREASE IN THE 
NUMBER OF LIBYANS IN SUDAN.  THE SUDAN SECURITY SERVICE 
HAS ALSO VOICED COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS OVER 
\"UNDOCUMENTED LIBYANS\" IN THE KHARTOUM AREA. 
 
10.  AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT, THE GOS HELD A 
CONVENTION MARCH 24-26 OF SOME 1,600 PEOPLE, MOSTLY 
SUDANESE INVOLVED IN PREVIOUS GOS CONFERENCES, TO PROVIDE 
A SHOW OF POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE INTEGRATION PROJECT. 
QADHAFI WAS SCHEDULED TO ADDRESS THE CLOSING RALLY OF THE 
CONFERENCE, BUT, DESPITE SEVERAL PRESS REPORTS TO 
CONTRARY, DID NOT ARRIVE IN KHARTOUM.  LIBYAN DEFENCE 
MINISTER ABU BAKR YUNIS ADDRESSED THE RALLY ALONG WITH 
SUDAN\'S HEAD OF STATE, GENERAL OMAR AL-BASHIR.  ACCORDING 
TO MISSION FSN WHO ATTENDED, 50,000 TO 70,000 SUDANESE 
PARTICPATED IN THE HOUR-LONG RALLY WHICH REPEATED WELL 
WORN EXHORTATIONS TO AND PRAISE FOR ARAB UNITY, THE 
CORNERSTONE OF WHICH IS NOW THE INTEGRATION OF SUDAN AND 
LIBYA.  (SEPTEL ON THE RALLY FOLLOWS). 
 
11.  AS A RESULT OF THE INTEGRATION AGREEMENT AND THE 
CONFERENCE THERE IS A MUCH GREATER AND MORE OBVIOUS 
LIBYAN PRESENCE IN KHARTOUM.  THE SITUATION, HOWEVER, IS 
TOO MUCH IN FLUX AT THE MOMENT TO PERMIT A CLEAR 
ASSESSMENT OF THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE UNITY 
AGREEMENT.  MOST OBSERVERS, INCLUDING SEVERAL ARAB 
AMBASSADORS AND THE CHADIAN AMBASSADOR, DO NOT EXPECT 
MUCH MORE THAN RHETORIC.  IN THE SHORT TERM, HOWEVER, THE 
LIBYANS ARE HERE IN STRENGTH, MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF THE 
MILITARY AND OTHER MORE MODERATE SECTORS OF SOCIETY. 
 
12.  REPORTS OF SUDANESE MILITARY DISENCHANTMENT WITH THE 
LIBYAN UNION HAVE CIRCULATED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS 
RELATIONSHIP.  THE ARREST OF SOME TWENTY RETIRED AND 
ACTIVE DUTY OFFICERS MARCH 25 (SEPTEL) FOR COUP PLOTTING 
REPORTEDLY FOLLOWED THEIR AGREEMENT TO MOVE ON A SPECIFIC 
DATE, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF OPPOSITION TO LIBYAN 
INTEGRATION.  HOW EFFECTIVE THE ARRESTS ULTIMATELY PROVE 
TO BE IN KEEPING THE SOLDIERS IN BARRACKS IS STILL NOT 
CLEAR.  WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT SUDAN\'S ARMED FORCES ARE 
UNHAPPY WITH THIS RELATIONSHIP.  GENERAL OMAR, WITH A WAR 
IN THE SOUTH AND A DISENCHANTED MILITARY WILL BE AN 
INCREASINGLY WARY AND NERVOUS CHIEF OF STATE.  HIS 
DEPENDENCE ON LIBYA WILL PROVIDE SMALL CONSOLATION.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  SUDAN\'S ARAB RELATIONSHIPS HAVE UNDERGONE A 
METAMORPHOSIS SINCE THE MILITARY COUP OF JUNE 1989.  MOST 
ARAB STATES REACTED WARMLY TO THE OUSTER OF SADIQ AL- 
MAHDI.  SINCE THEN, THIS WARMTH HAS DISSIPATED AS AN 
UNENLIGHTENED GOS HAS DRIFTED TOWARD LIBYA FOR SUSTENANCE. 
THE GOS HAS TRIED TO GLOSS OVER ITS PECULIAR INTEGRATION 
PLAN WITH LIBYA BY DEPICTING IT AS A STEP TOWARD ARAB 
UNITY.  WHILE SOUTHERN SUDANESE BLAME ARAB INFLUENCE FOR 
THEIR TROUBLES, SUDAN\'S ARAB IMPULSES REFLECT EXPEDIENCY 
MORE THAN CONVICTION.  OTHER THAN HISTORICAL, MULTIFACETED 
LINKAGES WITH EGYPT, SUDAN\'S ARAB TIES ARE LARGELY DRIVEN 
BY PROSPECTS OF JOBS AND AID, ESPECIALLY DONATION OF KEY 
COMMODITIES (WHEAT AND OIL) AND MILITARY MATERIAL.  THE 
RELATIONSHIPS TEND TO BE ONE-SIDED--SUDAN IS A WILLING 
RECIPIENT WITH LITTLE, EXCEPT RHETORIC AND ITS 
SOVEREIGNTY IN THE CASE OF LIBYA, TO OFFER.  AMONG ARABS, 
EGYPT IS MOST MINDFUL OF SUDAN WITH CONCERNS FOR WATER 
RESOURCES AND STABILITY.  SUDANESE ARE DRAWN TO EGYPT--AS 
MANY AS A MILLION MAY LIVE THERE--AND RELY ON ITS 
BENEFICIENCE BUT ARE QUICK TO BRIDLE AT PERCEIVED 
MEDDLING.  PRIME TARGETS FOR GOS SOLICITATIONS ARE LIBYA 
(RECEPTIVE), IRAQ (ONCE RECEPTIVE) AND SAUDI ARABIA 
(DISENCHANTED).  MEANWHILE LARGE SUDANESE COMMUNITIES IN 
SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT AND THE UAE REMAIN KEY SOURCES FOR 
PRIVATE INCOME AND BADLY NEEDED BUT DECLINING 
INVESTMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
OVERVIEW 
 
3.  SUDAN, WITH ITS ETHNIC AMALGAM STRETCHING SOUTH OF 
THE SAHARA, DOES NOT FIT COMFORTABLY INTO THE ARAB 
WORLD.  TO BE SURE, ARAB CULTURE--LANGUAGE, MEDIA, THE 
ARTS, HISTORY, MANNERS--PERMEATES NORTHERN SUDANESE 
THINKING AND BEHAVIOR, AND ITS INFLUENCE IS EVIDENT EVEN 
AMONG SOUTHERNERS PRONE TO RESIST IT.  MOREOVER, SUDAN\'S 
POLITICAL AND MILITARY INSTITUTIONS ARE DOMINATED BY 
MEMBERS OF RIVERINE, EASTERN AND WESTERN TRIBES 
CONVENTIONALLY CLASSIFIED AS ARAB.  AS POLITICS GO, 
HOWEVER, THIS ARABIST LINK, INTRODUCED BY THE EGYPTIANS, 
IS IN MANY WAYS AN ARTIFICIAL CONCEPTION.  SUDANESE, 
EMBROILED IN THEIR OWN NATIONAL AND PERSONAL PROBLEMS, 
ARE NOT EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN BY \"ARAB ISSUES\" LIKE THE 
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT AND THE IRANIAN THREAT, 
EXCEPT AS THEY BEAR A MORE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP, E.G. 
ISRAEL\'S ETHIOPIAN TIES AND ITS ALLEGED LINKS WITH THE 
SPLA.  RELIGIOUS AND RACIAL FACTORS--THE HISTORIC STAIN 
OF THE ARAB SLAVE TRADE, INSTANCES OF DISCRIMINATION, AND 
PERCEPTIONS OF ISLAMIC NONCONFORMITY--ALSO DISTANCE 
SUDANESE SOMEWHAT FROM THE ARAB MAINSTREAM. 
 
4.  NOTWITHSTANDING AMBIVALENT EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO 
THE OFFICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTS, PARTICIPATES IN THE 
INNUMERABLE ARAB GATHERINGS AND HIGHLIGHTS ITS ARAB 
CREDENTIALS WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO THE EXTENT OF 
UNDERTAKING AIRY UNITY PROJECTS.  THE REASON IS PLAINLY 
SELF-INTEREST.  SUDAN EMBRACES ARABISM BECAUSE IT 
LITERALLY PAYS TO DO SO.  SUFFERING FROM AN INTERMINABLE 
WAR AND ECONOMIC DEVASTATION, SUDAN NEEDS THE JOB AND AID 
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARAB COUNTRIES CAN AND SOMETIMES DO 
PROVIDE. 
 
5.  WHILE NORTHERN SUDANESE TEND TO ACCEPT THEIR ARAB 
STATUS AS USEFUL, SOUTHERNERS PERCEIVE ARABS AS THE 
PROBLEM.  TO SOUTHERNERS, \"ARAB\" HAS BECOME A PEJORATIVE 
TERM REPRESENTING UNJUST AND OPPRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. 
PASSING OVER SUDAN\'S ETHNIC DIVERSITY, TRADITIONAL 
RIVALRIES AND IDEOLOGICAL DIVISIONS, THEY ARE FOND OF 
BLAMING THE ARABS FOR MISRULE AND INEQUITY.  A FREQUENT 
SOUTHERN REFRAIN IS THAT ARABS CONSTITUTE ONLY A 
MINORITY, THOUGH A PLURALITY, IN SUDAN, WHICH IS PROBABLY 
TRUE.  BASED ON THIS ASSUMPTION, SOUTHERNERS ARGUE THAT 
THEIR UNITING WITH NONARAB NORTHERNERS--SUCH AS THE NUBA, 
THE FUR, AND THE NUBIANS--COULD RESOLVE SUDAN\'S DIVISIVE 
PROBLEMS.  THE IMPROBABILITY OF THIS THESIS ONLY 
UNDERSCORES ITS FALLACY.  RELIGIOUS, IDEOLOGICAL AND 
TRADITIONAL TRIBAL DIVISIONS OUTWEIGH THE ISSUE OF ARAB 
TIES.  THE FUR OF DARFUR, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE MORE AT EASE 
WITH ARAB MUSLIMS, EXCEPTING PERHAPS THEIR RIZEIGAT 
ADVERSARIES, THAN WITH SOUTHERN CHRISTIANS. 
 
6.  THE ARAB WORLD, FOR THE MOST PART, LOOKS ON SUDAN AS 
CHRONICALLY WAYWARD WITH SELF-INDUCED PROBLEMS.  SUDANESE 
ARE VIEWED AS PERSONABLE, RESPECTFUL OF AUTHORITY, AND 
DEPENDABLE WORKERS ABROAD BUT, AT HOME, HOPELESSLY 
INCAPABLE OF MANAGING THEMSELVES.  EXASPERATION AND 
PATERNALISM ARE STANDARD ARAB RESPONSES.  BROODING ABOUT 
BURDENSOME AND UNSAFE (THE UAE AMBASSADOR WAS NEARLY 
ASSASSINATED IN 1988) LIVING CONDITIONS, ARAB DIPLOMATS 
IN KHARTOUM UNIFORMLY CRAVE EARLY REASSIGNMENTS.  THEIR 
AVOIDANCE OF THE WESTERN DIPLOMATIC CIRCUIT (EXCEPTING 
EGYPT ABD MOROCCO) IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THEIR 
INDUSTRY, THOUGH SOME ARE NOTICEABLY UNINFORMED AND 
UNPRODUCTIVE   THE EGYPTIANS ARE THE MOST NUMBEROUS, 
ACTIVE, VISIBLE AND BEST INFORMED OF ARAB DIPLOMATS. 
DIPLOMATS FROM WEALTHIER ARAB STATES ALSO SOCIALIZE 
REGULARLY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE 
USUALLY ASKED FOR MORE ASSISTANCE THAN ADVICE. 
 
7.  TWO AXIOMS WELL DEFINE THE STATE OF SUDAN\'S ARAB 
RELATIONS TODAY.  FIRST, A SENSE OF DEJA VU PREVAILS. 
IRRESOLUTE DECISIONMAKING AND ZIGZAGING POLICIES 
CHARACTERIZING SADIQ AL-MAHDI\'S GOVERNMENTS HAS ALSO 
PLAGUED THEIR MILITARY SUCCESSOR PUSHING SUDAN TOWARD 
INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION AND IRRELEVANCE.  SADIQ\'S OUSTER 
IN JUNE 1989 WAS WELCOMED HEARTILY BY MOST ARABS.  THE 
FORMER PRIME MINISTER\'S INCOMPETENT RULE, TACTLESS 
CONDUCT AND FLIRTATIONS WITH THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT 
(NIF) AND IRAN MANAGED TO ANTAGONIZE PRACTICALLY ALL 
ARABS SAVE LIBYA.  THESE EARLY CHEERS SOURED HOWEVER AS 
THE RCC RAPIDLY REVEALED THEIR OWN BRAND OF ECONOMIC 
MISMANAGEMENT, INABILITY TO COMPROMISE FOR PEACE AND A 
POLITICAL AGENDA WHICH IS ATTRACTIVE TO ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISTS.  THE REGIME WHICH BEGAN BY COLD 
SHOULDERING THE LIBYANS AND MAKING OVERTURES TO MODERATE 
ARABS GRADUALLY REVERTED, BECAUSE OF NECESSITY, TO WHERE 
SUDAN\'S WARMEST PUBLIC RELATIONSHIP IS AGAIN THAT WITH 
LIBYA. 
 
8.  SECOND, SUDAN\'S ARAB RELATIONSHIPS, LARGELY 
UNILATERAL IN TERMS OF TANGIBLE ECONOMIC AND MILITARY 
BENEFITS, CLEARLY ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO SUDAN THAN TO ITS 
PARTNERS.  A HIERARCHY EXISTS AMONG THESE RELATIONSHIPS. 
ON THE PERIPHERY, WITH MINIMAL TIES TO SUDAN, ARE THE 
MAHGREB STATES (MOROCCO, ALGERIA, TUNISIA), PEOPLES OF 
THE LEVANT (LEBANESE, SYRIANS, PALESTINIANS, JORDANIANS) 
AND OTHER NONDONOR AFRICAN COUNTRIES (SOMALIA, DJIBOUTI, 
MAURITANIA).  OF GREATER IMPORTANCE ARE THE SMALL ARABIAN 
PENINSULAR STATES WHERE MANY SUDANESE WORK.  MORE VITAL 
ARE SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA AND IRAQ WHICH ARE PRIME TARGETS 
FOR AID AND EMPLOYMENT.  FINALLY, EGYPT IS IN A CATEGORY 
OF ITS OWN.  A BRIEF SURVEY OF SOME OF THESE 
RELATIONSHIPS FOLLOWS. 
 
EGYPT 
 
9.  SUDAN HAS LONG MAINTAINED A SUBSTANTIAL (THOUGH 
OCCASIONALLY PRICKLY) RELATIONSHIP WITH EGYPT THAT IS 
FIRMLY FOUNDED ON HISTORY AND THE NILE.  COMBINED WITHIN 
OTTOMAN EGYPT AND THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN CONDOMINIUM (AND 
EVEN EARLIER DATING BACK TO CUSHITE PHARAOHS), SUDANESE 
AND EGYPTIANS REFER TO THEMSELVES AS BROTHERS.  BY ITS 
VERY FAMILIARITY AND OBVIOUS ASYMMETRY, THE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP UNDERGOES PERIODIC STRAINS.  MUTUAL 
INTERESTS AND PERSONAL CONTACTS SO TIGHTLY INTERTWINE 
THIS LINK, HOWEVER, THAT A RUPTURE IS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE 
TO IMAGINE. 
 
10.  THE EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE RELATIONSHIP IS FAR DEEPER AND 
MORE MULTI-FACETED THAN MANY REALIZE.  EGYPT\'S PRIMARY 
CONCERN IS STABILITY ON ITS SOUTHERN BORDER AND ENSURING 
ITS WATER SUPPLY.  MEASUREMENT OF NILE WATERS IS AN 
IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF EGYPTIAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS.  SUDAN, 
EGYPT AND ETHIOPIA FREQUENTLY DEBATE WATER ALLOCATIONS IN 
BILATERAL SESSIONS AND IN FORMAL MEETINGS OF A NILE WATER 
COMMISSION.  (SUDAN REPORTEDLY USES ONLY ONE QUARTER OF 
ITS ALLOCATION WHILE EGYPT USES TWICE ITS ALLOCATED 
AMOUNT.)  ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST SUCCESSES IN SUDAN THAT 
COULD STIMULATE EGYPT\'S RELIGIOUS RIGHT WORRY THE 
EGYPTIANS ABOVE OTHER POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS.  THERE IS 
NOT, HOWEVER, A STRONG LINK BETWEEN THE NIF AND EGYPT\'S 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND ASSORTED ISLAMIC GAMAA GROUPINGS. 
EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE TIES IN GENERAL ARE SUSTAINED THROUGH A 
VARIETY OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONNECTIONS.  AMONG THEM:  A 
STEADY STREAM OF SUDANESE SHOPPERS, VACATIONERS AND 
JOB-SEEKERS TRAVELLING TO EGYPT (UP TO A MILLION ARE 
BELIEVED TO LIVE THERE); AN OPTIONAL EGYPTIAN SCHOOL 
SYSTEM, ELEMENTARY THROUGH UNIVERSITY, IN SUDAN FUNDED BY 
THE GOE; THE PERVASIVE INFLUENCE OF EGYPTIAN MEDIA AND 
POPULAR CULTURE IN SUDAN; AN ESTIMATED 20,000 SUDANESE 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN EGYPT (INCLUDING 1000 SOUTHERNERS 
ON EGYPTIAN SCHOLARSHIPS); STRONG COMMERCIAL AND 
PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; EGYPTIAN DEVELOPMENT 
ASSISTANCE, ESPECIALLY IN AGRICULTURE; EGYPTIAN TRAINING 
FOR POLICE, MILITARY OFFICERS AND TRADE UNIONISTS; AND A 
HERITAGE OF EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE MARRIAGES (SADAT\'S MOTHER 
WAS SUDANESE; AHMAD AL-MIRGHANI AND MUBARAK AL-MAHDI\'S 
MOTHERS ARE EGYPTIAN). 
 
11.  DESPITE THEIR CLOSE RELATIONS, EGYPTIANS ADMIT TO 
BEING CONSTANTLY CONFOUNDED BY THEIR UNPREDICTABLE 
SOUTHERN BROTHERS.  SHOCKED IN THE 1950\'S WHEN SUDAN ON 
SHORT NOTICE AND IN A REVERSAL OF POLICY OPTED FOR 
INDEPENDENCE RATHER THAN UNION, THE EGYPTIANS HAVE SINCE 
TRIED, OFTEN UNSUCCESSFULLY, TO GUIDE SUDANESE POLICIES 
WITHOUT SEEMING OVERBEARING.  MANY EGYPTIANS PRIVATELY 
ADMIT TO VIEWING SUDANESE AS INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR. 
BUT THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO DEAL CAREFULLY WITH 
SUDANESE WHO ARE HYPERSENSITIVE TO PERCEIVED EGYPTIAN 
INSULTS TO THEIR DIGNITY. 
 
12.  BY CONTRAST, MOST SUDANESE ARE CYNICAL AND DUBIOUS 
ABOUT EGYPTIAN MOTIVES.  MANY ARE CONVINCED THAT THE 
EGYPTIANS HAVE NOT DISCARDED PLANS TO UNITE WITH AND 
CONTROL SUDAN.  (ONLY A FEW SUDANESE DINOSAURS BELONGING 
TO THE OLD NATIONAL UNIONIST PARTY STILL SUPPORT THIS 
ONCE POPULAR DREAM.)  THE BUILDING OF THE ASWAN DAM, 
WHICH FORCED THE RELOCATION OF NORTHERN SUDANESE 
RESIDENTS OF WADI HALFA, AND THE UNCOMPLETED JONGOLAI 
CANAL, BELIEVED BY SOUTHERNERS TO BE AN EGYPTIAN PLOT TO 
DIVERT NILE WATERS FOR ITS BENEFIT, STILL AROUSES 
RESENTMENT.  THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT THE UBIQUITOUS EGYPTIAN 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.  IN EXPLAINING THEIR ATTITUDES, 
SUDANESE WILL OFTEN DRAW DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN SUDANESE 
AND EGYPTIAN PERSONALITY AND CHARACTER TRAITS.  EGYPTIANS 
COMMONLY ARE SAID TO BE CAREFREE, HUMOROUS, DECEPTIVE AND 
MACHIEVILLIAN, AND COMFORTABLE WITH AUTHORITARIAN RULE 
WHILE THE SUDANESE DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS SERIOUS, 
INTROVERTED, HONEST, DIRECT AND POLITICALLY LIBERTARIAN. 
 
13.  SUDANESE WILL USUALLY SAY THAT EGYPTIANS EVOKE 
BITTERSWEET FEELINGS.  MOST SUDANESE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 
THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH EGYPTIANS AND THAT EGYPT IS 
THEIR MOST INTIMATE AND IMPORTANT NEIGHBOR.  ON 
PRACTICALLY ANY POLITICAL ISSUE--E.G. AN ALTERNATIVE TO 
SHARIA, LIBYAN INTEGRATION, HANGING OF CURRENCY 
VIOLATORS--THE FIRST SUDANESE REACTION IS TO WONDER ABOUT 
EGYPT\'S REACTION.  DEEP DOWN, SUDANESE, EVEN MOST UMMA 
PARTY ADHERENTS, ADMIT TO THE EXPECTATION, IF NOT 
APPRECIATION, OF EGYPTIAN GUIDANCE AND PROTECTION.  AT 
THE SAME TIME, REFLECTING THE CLASSIC LOVE/HATE EMOTIONS 
OF A SUBORDINATE TOWARD HIS MORE POWERFUL GUARDIAN, 
SUDANESE ENJOY NOTHING BETTER THAN TO BAIT EGYPTIANS AND 
WATCH THEM PUBLICLY HUMILIATED.  A DISPUTED FOUL IN A 
FOOTBALL MATCH IN KHARTOUM BETWEEN SUDAN AND EGYPT ALMOST 
STARTED A RIOT IN EARLY 1989.  MOST SUDANESE 
ENTHUSIASTICALLY CHEERED FOR ALGERIA (AS THEY WILL FOR 
ANY OPPONENT OF EGYPT) IN ALGERIA\'S RECENT WORLD CUP 
MATCHES WITH EGYPT. 
 
14.  THE RESULT OF THE JUNE 30 COUP WAS A SURPRISE TO THE 
EGYPTIANS THOUGH, AT THE TIME, THE GOE CERTAINLY WELCOMED 
AND ENCOURAGED CHANGE MORE THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT, AS 
A RESULT OF ITS ROCKY RELATIONSHIP WITH SADIQ AL-MAHDI 
AND HIS EGYPTOPHOBIC UMMA COLLEAGUES.  GENERAL OMAR 
HIGHLIGHTED THE SHIFT IN POLICY BY INVITING EGYPTIAN 
AMBASSADOR SHERBINI FOR DISCUSSIONS SOON AFTER THE COUP 
AND MAKING CAIRO HIS FIRST FOREIGN CALL (IN CONTRAST TO 
SADIQ WHO DELIBERATELY SNUBBED EGYPT AND TRAVELLED WIDELY 
BEFORE VISITING EGYPT.)  WITH UNAPOLOGETIC DECLARATIONS 
OF SUPPORT FOR THE GOE, THE RCC SOLICITED ADVICE OF 
PRESIDENT MUBARAK AND AMBASSADOR SHERBINI.  THE 
BLANDISHMENTS AND THE POLITICAL TURNAROUND IN THE GOS 
POSTURE TOWARD EGYPT HAD THEIR DESIRED EFFECT, WITH THE 
GOE SENDING EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGING 
DONATIONS FROM ITS WEALTHIER MODERATE ARAB FRIENDS. 
MUBARAK AND THE EGYPTIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 
(TRADITIONAL LEADING PLAYERS INVOLVING SUDAN) CLEARLY 
WANTED TO BELIEVE IN GENERAL OMAR.  MOUNTING EVIDENCE OF 
FUNDAMENTALIST LEANINGS, UNPOPULARITY, AND INCOMPETENCY 
WERE DISCOUNTED, EVENTUALLY LEADING IN LATE 1989 TO AN 
EGYPTIAN SPLIT IN PERCEPTIONS OF SUDAN BETWEEN SENIOR 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS AND A LESS SANGUINE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY.  THIS SPLIT QUICKLY BECAME A HOT TOPIC OF 
SUDANESE POLITICAL CONVERSATION.  WHILE BIFURCATED GOE 
VIEWS OF SUDAN APPARENTLY REMAIN, SUDANESE ARGUE THAT GOE 
DISCONTENT WITH EVENTS IN SUDAN HAVE WIDENED AND DEEPENED 
AS THE GOS HAS WARMED TO LIBYA AND FAILED TO MAKE PEACE 
WITH THE SPLA.  MOST BELIEVE THAT THE GOE HAS RETREATED 
SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ITS EARLY SUPPORT OF THE RCC AND THAT 
FROSTIER BILATERAL RELATIONS, AND EVEN COUP PLOTTING, 
REMINISCENT OF A YEAR AGO ARE IN THE OFFING. 
 
15.  ALTHOUGH SUDANESE SHOP FOR CONSUMER GOODS IN CAIRO 
AND MOST LOCAL MERCHANTS (INCLUDING MANY COPTS) MAINTAIN 
TIES TO EGYPTIAN COMPANIES, EGYPT IS NOT SUDAN\'S TOP 
TRADING PARTNER.  OFFICIAL TRADE HAS BEEN GOVERNED BY 
SPECIAL TRADE PROTOCOLS THAT PROVIDES BARTER AND SPECIAL 
ACCOUNTING MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH THE NONCONVERTIBLE 
CURRENCIES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THESE PROTOCOLS, 
LARGELY ILLUSORY (TRADE GOES ON REGARDLESS) WITH FANCIFUL 
PROJECTED AMOUNTS--USDOLS 360 MILLION IN THE 1989 
PROTOCOL--AND AN OVERVALUED SUDANESE POUND IN RELATION TO 
THE EGYPTIAN POUND, HAVE BROKEN DOWN REGULARLY WITH 
MUTUAL CHARGES OF AN UNFAIR SURPLUS AND FAILURE TO LIVE 
UP TO THE ACCORD.  IN 1989, THE GOVERNMENT OF SADIQ 
AL-MAHDI ABROGATED THE PROTOCOL AND RESORTED BRIEFLY TO 
TIGHT RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE AND BORDER TRAFFIC (NUBIANS 
IN NORTHERN SUDAN TRADITIONALLY HAVE FLOATED BETWEEN 
BORDERS).  WITH FRIENDLIER BILATERAL TIES AFTER THE COUP, 
ANOTHER LUCRATIVE PROTOCOL WAS NEGOTIATED.  KEY PROBLEMS 
WITH THE PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN SMUGGLING, ESPECIALLY OF 
SUDANESE CAMELS BYPASSING EGYPTIAN CUSTOMS OFFICIALS, AND 
A COMPLICATED MULTIPLE EXCHANGE RATE REGIME THAT DIFFERS 
ACCORDING TO VARIOUS COMMODITIES.  ACCORDING TO THE 
LATEST STATISTICS, SUDAN EXPORTED 26,607,000 SUDANESE 
POUNDS (USDOLS 2,216,000 BASED ON CURRENT COMMERCIAL 
EXCHANGE RATE) WORTH OF GOODS TO EGYPT IN THE FIRST HALF 
OF 1989--PRIMARILY SESAME, WATERMELON SEEDS AND CAMELS. 
CAMELS CONSTITUTE THE BULK OF EXPORTS.  (THE 1989 
PROTOCOL ASSIGNED A VALUE OF USDOLS 120 MILLION FOR CAMEL 
EXPORTS; LITTLE OF THE CAMEL TRADE FLOWS THROUGH OFFICIAL 
CHANNELS.)  DURING THE SAME PERIOD, IMPORTS FROM EGYPT 
TOTALED 113,081,000 SUDANESE POUNDS (USDOLS 9,423,000), 
CONCENTRATED IN TEXTILES AND OTHER MANUFACTURED GOODS. 
THE TEMPORARY RUPTURE IN THE PROTOCOL FAILED TO PUT A 
DENT INTO TRADE PATTERNS.  TOTAL OFFICIAL EGYPTIAN TRADE 
(IMPORTS AND EXPORTS) FOR ALL OF 1988 AMOUNTED TO 161 
MILLION POUNDS. 
 
16.  PLEADING POVERTY AND A NEED TO APPEAR EVENHANDED IN 
SUDAN\'S CIVIL WAR, EGYPT HAS PROVIDED LITTLE MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE, MUCH TO THE SUDANESE ARMY\'S CHAGRIN.  A 
MILITARY AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN SUDAN AND EGYPT.  A 
DEFENSE TREATY SIGNED BY NIMEIRI WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A 
WEAK \"BROTHERHOOD CHARTER\" UNDER SADIQ AL-MAHDI.  EVEN 
THIS WAS REPEALED IN 1989 AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE SPLA. 
AFTER THE COUP HOWEVER, THE GOS ANNOUNCED THAT THE 
MILITARY DEFENSE TREATY HAD NEVER BEEN ABROGATED AND THUS 
REMAINED IN EFFECT.  THE GOE, INDIFFERENT TO WHETHER A 
TREATY EXISTS OR NOT, HAS SHOWN RELATIVELY LITTLE 
INTEREST IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR.  EGYPT\'S BIGGEST INFLUENCE 
WITH THE SUDANESE MILITARY HAS BEEN THROUGH ITS TRAINING 
PROGRAMS, RANGING FROM BASIC LEVELS TO NASSER HIGHER WAR 
COLLEGE.  SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND 
COUNCIL (RCC) RECEIVED TRAINING IN EGYPT, WHICH REMAINS 
SUDAN\'S CENTER OF FOREIGN MILITARY TRAINING.  MOST 
SUDANESE OFFICERS ARE SYMPATHETIC TO EGYPTIANS, THOUGH 
THEY CHAFE AT THE LACK OF MATERIAL HELP.  SMALL AMOUNTS 
OF MILITARY AID RECENTLY PROVIDED HAVE BEEN NONLETHAL 
SUCH AS UNIFORMS AND PARACHUTES.  SUDANESE ARE QUICK TO 
REMIND THE EGYPTIANS THAT SUDANESE BRIGADES FOUGHT SIDE 
BY SIDE WITH THE EGYPTIANS DURING ALL THE ARAB-ISRAELI 
WARS. 
 
LIBYA 
 
17.  AN INTEGRATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUDAN AND LIBYA 
ABRUPTLY ANNOUNCED IN EARLY MARCH 1990 PROPOSING TO 
COMBINE THE TWO COUNTRIES\' POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, MILITARY, 
AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS WITHIN FOUR YEARS CULMINATED A STEADY 
WARMING TREND IN THE RCC\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH TRIPOLI.  A 
RECURRING PHENOMENON TO LURE COLONEL QADHAFI\'S FAVOR, THE 
UNITY PACKAGE LARGELY REGURGITATED OLD IDEAS INCORPORATED 
MOST RECENTLY IN AN ABORTED UNITY PLAN MOOTED IN 1988. 
DESPITE ORNATE RHETORIC, MULTIPLE OFFICIAL VISITS, AND A 
CONFERENCE DEVOTED TO PROMOTING UNITY, FEW SUDANESE 
SERIOUSLY BELIEVE IT WILL SUCCEED.  THUS, CONFIDENT THAT 
UNITY WILL UNGLUE BEFORE IT MATERIALIZES, PUBLIC 
OPPOSITION TO INTEGRATION IS LIMITED, THOUGH SENIOR ARMY 
OFFICERS REPORTEDLY HAVE VOICED DISSATISFACTION. 
RIDICULE IS THE MORE COMMON REACTION.  AWARE OF THE 
DERISION, THE GOS HAS TRIED TO PORTRAY THE ACCORD AS A 
STEP TOWARD PAN-ARAB UNITY, A MORE PALATABLE IF EQUALLY 
UNLIKELY NOTION.  THE UNITY SCHEME, SO LONG AS IT IS 
UNREALIZED ALSO HAS ITS SUPPORTERS.  MANY SUDANESE 
ACCEPT LIBYAN AID AS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY AND WELL WORTH 
HOLLOW RHETORIC AND QUIXOTIC UNITY SCHEMES.  SUDANESE 
MOSTLY LOOK UPON LIBYANS AS DUNDERHEADS AND QADHAFI AS 
ECCENTRIC BUT NOT A REAL THREAT TO SUDAN.  \"MILK THEM 
WHILE YOU CAN\" IS A POPULAR SENTIMENT. 
 
18.  TO BE SURE, SUDANESE SECURITY AUTHORITIES, MINDFUL 
OF LIBYAN MISCHIEF, HAVE GENERALLY TRIED TO KEEP CLOSE 
TABS ON LIBYAN ACTIVITIES AND MOVEMENTS IN AND NEAR 
KHARTOUM.  THE RECENT ABOLITION OF VISAS FOR LIBYANS (AND 
SUBSEQUENTLY ALL ARABS) COMPLICATES THEIR JOB, THOUGH 
SECURITY OFFICERS AT THE AIRPORT REPORTEDLY ARE PAYING 
SPECIAL ATTENTION TO LIBYAN VISITORS WHEN THEY PASS 
THROUGH NORMAL IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS PROCEDURES. 
CYNICS RECKON THERE IS LITTLE LEFT TO SABOTAGE IN SUDAN. 
LACKLUSTER LIBYAN-BACKED REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES IN 
SUDAN, RECOGNIZED AS A \"POLITICAL PARTY\" BEFORE THE COUP, 
DISBANDED WITH THE ABOLITION OF PARTIES, AND, ACCORDING 
TO SEVERAL SUDANESE, HAVE REMAINED INACTIVE.  LIBYANS 
APPEAR TO BE FOCUSING INSTEAD ON LINKING THEIR POPULAR 
ORGANIZATIONS WITH SUDAN\'S LOCALLY-BASED, AND 
INCREASINGLY ACTIVE PEOPLES\' COMMITTEES AND POPULAR 
DEFENSE FORCES.  AS FOR LIBYAN TRANSGRESSIONS IN DARFUR, 
WHILE SOME SUDANESE PROFESS TO BE TROUBLED BY THE AFFRONT 
TO SUDAN\'S SOVEREIGNTY, THE MAJORITY SEEM CONTENT TO TURN 
A BLIND EYE TO EVENTS IN A REMOTE AREA. 
 
19.  LIBYA\'S MAIN ECONOMIC ATTRACTION IS CHEAP OIL BUT 
SUDAN HAS LITTLE OF VALUE TO OFFER IN RETURN.  DEPRIVED 
OF REGULAR SUPPLIES FROM KUWAIT AND SAUDI ARABIA, DUE TO 
NONPAYMENT AND RCC POLITICS, SUDAN RECENTLY HAS HAD TO 
RELY ALMOST COMPLETELY ON LIBYAN OIL.  THE CURRENT DEAL 
FOR LIBYAN OIL REQUIRES SUDAN TO PAY ONLY FOR INTEREST ON 
THE PURCHASE WITH THE PRINCIPAL TO BE PAID IN KIND WITH 
FUTURE SUDANESE OIL PRODUCTION.  DESPITE WELL-PUBLICIZED 
AGREEMENTS WITH LIBYA, SHIPMENTS OF LIBYAN OIL HAVE BEEN 
ERRATIC.  LIBYA\'S PROMISED 50,000 METRIC TONS OF OIL PER 
MONTH TO SADIQ\'S GOVERNMENT AND THE RCC HAS NOT ALWAYS 
ARRIVED.  FOLLOWING THE MARCH 1990 INTEGRATION ACCORD, 
LIBYA PLEDGED TO DOUBLE ITS SUDANESE OIL SHIPMENTS TO 
100,000 METRIC TONS FOR BOTH APRIL AND MAY. 
 
20.  SUDAN\'S BALANCE OF TRADE WITH LIBYA HAS BEEN 
ENTIRELY NEGATIVE ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT FIGURES.  FOR 
THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 1989, LIBYA RECEIVED NO SUDANESE 
EXPORTS WHILE SUDAN IMPORTED 269,712,000 POUNDS (USDOLS 
22,500,000) OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS FROM LIBYA.  LIBYA HAS 
FOCUSED INSTEAD ON OBTAINING POLITICAL DIVIDENDS FROM 
TRADE.  THIS WAS DRAMATICALLY REFLECTED IN THE 1989 
KHARTOUM TRADE FAIR WHEN LIBYA\'S BOOTH WAS CONFINED TO 
ANTI-AMERICAN SLOGANS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF ALLEGED 
CASUALTIES FROM U.S. BOMBING OF TRIPOLI.  (THE U.S. 
PULLED OUT WHEN THE GOS FAILED TO ACT ON AMERICAN 
PROTESTS.)  IN DECEMBER 1989, SUDAN AND LIBYA APPROVED A 
USDOLS 50 MILLION COMMERCIAL PROTOCOL PLEDGING THE EXPORT 
OF SUDANESE GOATS, OIL SEEDS, PERFUME AND TEXTILES IN 
RETURN FOR OIL, FERTILIZERS AND CEMENT.  AS WITH THE 
EGYPTIAN PROTOCOL, THE ACCORD IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR ITS 
POLITICAL DIMENSIONS RATHER THAN AS A GUIDE TO ACTUAL 
TRADE.  A BILATERAL PROTOCOL IN AGRICULTURAL COOPERATION 
WAS SIGNED IN FEBRUARY 1990 AIMED AT LIBYAN BANKROLLING 
CEREAL AND MEAT PRODUCTION FACILITIES.  LIBYAN 
AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANCE ALSO HAS MORE POLITICAL THAN 
ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE; A LIBYAN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 
SCHEME IN DARFUR IS WIDELY VIEWED AS A FRONT FOR ARMS 
SMUGGLING AND OTHER NONAGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES. 
 
21.  SUDAN AND LIBYA RECENTLY RESURRECTED THE IDEA OF A 
JOINT INVESTMENT BANK CAPITALIZED AT USDOLS 50 MILLION 
AND HAVE DISCUSSED IMPROVEMENT OF COMMUNICATION AND 
TRANSPORT SERVICES BETWEEN THEIR COUNTRIES.  AS IN THE 
CASE OF OIL SHIPMENTS HOWEVER, LIBYAN PROMISES OF 
ECONOMIC HELP FOR ECONOMIC PROJECTS HAVE HAD A HABIT OF 
NOT MATERIALIZING.  LIBYA PROVIDES A MODEST NUMBER OF 
JOBS FOR SUDANESE--ABOUT 2000 SUDANESE RESIDE IN LIBYA 
BESIDES SEASONAL MIGRATION OF SUDANESE TRIBES FROM DARFUR 
INTO KUFRA.  A SUDANESE ESTIMATED THAT 2000-3000 DARFUR 
TRIBESMEN WORK WITHOUT PERMITS IN KUFRA. 
 
22.  LIBYA, ONCE A BACKER OF THE SPLA, IS NOW SUDAN\'S 
MOST DEPENDABLE MILITARY SUPPLIER.  THE SUBSTANTIAL 
SUPPLY RELATIONSHIP EXISTS EITHER BASED ON SECRET PACTS 
AS ALLEGED BY THE SPLA OR, MORE LIKELY, BASED ON INFORMAL 
ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED BY SADIQ AL-MAHDI\'S MINIONS AND 
SUBSEQUENTLY RENEWED BY THE RCC.  A FORMAL MILITARY 
PROTOCOL SIGNED BY THE GOS SHORTLY AFTER PRESIDENT 
NIMEIRI\'S OUSTER WAS NOT OPEN-ENDED AND REFERRED ONLY TO 
A SPECIFIC LIST OF ITEMS.  BY WHATEVER RATIONALE, THE 
LIBYANS HAVE LOANED OR DONATED IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MILITARY PROVISIONS RANGING FROM 
AMMUNITION TO MIG-23 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT.  DOLLAR FIGURES 
ARE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE, BUT THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THIS 
AID HAS BEEN A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN PROPPING UP THE SUDANESE 
ARMY IN ITS CONFLICT WITH THE SPLA.  SINCE THE COUP, 
LIBYA HAS DISPATCHED TWICE WEEKLY TO SUDAN AN IL-76 
TRANSPORT PLANE LADEN WITH SUPPLIES, BELIEVED EXCLUSIVELY 
FOR MILITARY USE.  IN ADDITION, LIBYA HAS PROVIDED 
TRAINING, ADVISORS AND PILOTS, THOUGH LIBYA\'S DIRECT 
INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MILITARY IN SUDAN HAS BEEN DENIED BY 
THE GOS.  LIBYAN MILITARY, HOWEVER, ARE PERIODICALLY SEEN 
AT KHARTOUM HOTELS AND MILITARY FACILITIES.  LIBYA\'S 
INVOLVEMENT IN BOMBING RAIDS WAS PROVEN WHEN THE SPLA 
PRODUCED A LIBYAN PILOT AFTER DOWNING A MIG AIRCRAFT IN 
1989.  THE GOS STILL DENIED IT.  LIBYAN PILOTS SEEM TO 
OPERATE AUTONOMOUSLY, WITH THE TACIT BACKING OF THE 
SUDANESE MILITARY BRASS. 
 
SAUDI ARABIA 
 
23.  WHILE SHUNNING THE SPOTLIGHT, SAUDI ARABIA, MORE 
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY, PLAYS A CRITICAL ECONOMIC ROLE IN 
BOLSTERING SUDAN THROUGH LARGE-SCALE REMITTANCE-PRODUCING 
EMPLOYMENT, DIRECT GOVERNMENT AID, TRADE AND PRIVATE 
INVESTMENT.  WITH AN ESTIMATED 350,000 SUDANESE 
DOCUMENTED EXPATRIATE WORKERS (PLUS ANOTHER 150,000 OR SO 
WHO NEVER RETURNED FROM HAJ), SAUDI ARABIA PROVIDES THE 
LARGEST SHARE OF REMITTANCES.  BECAUSE THE BULK OF 
REMITTANCES HAVE COME TO SUDAN THROUGH UNOFFICIAL 
CHANNELS, THEY HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE. 
ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY IN 1985, TOTAL REMITTANCES 
AMOUNTED TO USDOLS 2.9 BILLION, ONE-THIRD OF SUDAN\'S 
GNP.  OFFICIAL EXPATRIATE REMITTANCES IN 1988 TOTALED 
USDOLS 445 MILLION WHICH CONSTITUTED 78 PERCENT OF 
SUDAN\'S HARD CURRENCY BUDGET.  SINCE THE COUP HOWEVER, 
NOT ONLY HAS OFFICIAL REMITTANCES DECLINED TO AN ANNUAL 
0ARGET OF USDOLS 300 MILLION (AND PROBABLY MUCH LESS), 
BUT UNOFFICIAL REMITTANCES, PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED PRIVATE 
INVESTMENT, ALSO HAVE DRIED UP IN THE FACE OF THE 
ANTI-CORRUPTION ZEAL OF THE RCC.  EXPATRIATES HAVE 
PREFERRED TO KEEP THEIR SAVINGS IN FOREIGN ACCOUNTS WHICH 
THEIR FAMILIES USE WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE 
OF SUDAN. 
 
24.  WITH ITS RELATIVELY HIGH SALARIES, SAUDI ARABIA IS 
THE FAVORED DESTINATION FOR AMBITIOUS AND ENTERPRISING 
SUDANESE.  THRONGS OF VISA APPLICANTS CAN ALWAYS BE SEEN 
OUTSIDE THE SAUDI EMBASSY IN KHARTOUM DURING WORKING 
HOURS.  SUDANESE WORKERS IN SAUDI ARABIA RANGE FROM 
PROFESSIONALS (TWO-THIRDS OF SUDANESE DOCTORS ARE 
OVERSEAS) TO MANUAL LABORERS.  THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT HAS 
PROVIDED IRREGULAR DOSES OF AID, MOST RECENTLY RELEASING 
207 MILLION RIYALS (USDOLS 55.2 MILLION) TO REBUILD THE 
ROAD FROM KHARTOUM TO PORT SUDAN.  THE SAUDIS HAVE 
GENERALLY AVOIDED MILITARY ASSISTANCE.  THEY RECENTLY 
TURNED DOWN, FOR EXAMPLE, GOS REQUESTS FOR SMALL NAVAL 
CRAFT FOR ANTISMUGGLING PATROLS ON THE RED SEA.  THEY 
REPORTEDLY FINANCED, HOWEVER, THE SUDANESE PURCHASE FROM 
CHINA IN 1989 OF 40 TANKS AND 40 ARMORED PERSONNEL 
CARRIERS (APC\'S), ALONG WITH FIELD AND ANTIAIRCRAFT 
ARTILLERY AND SMALL ARMS.  THE SAUDI MONETARY FUND AND 
SAUDI FUND FOR DEVELOPMENT HAVE FUNDED NUMEROUS ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS INCLUDING ABOUT FIFTY THAT ARE 
ONGOING.  REHABILITATION OF THE GEZIRA AGRICULTURAL 
SCHEME AND A NEW AIRPORT IN PORT SUDAN ARE EXAMPLES OF 
MAJOR PROJECTS UNDERWAY.  ACCORDING TO 1988 FIGURES, 
SAUDI AGENCIES HAD OVER USDOLS 1.2 BILLION IN OUTSTANDING 
LOANS TO SUDAN, BY FAR THE LARGEST LOAN COMMITMENT OF ANY 
NATION.  REPORTEDLY, SAUDI WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE AID HAS 
LANGUISHED RECENTLY BECAUSE OF SAUDI DISMAY WITH RCC 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT. 
 
25.  OFFICIAL TRADE FIGURES CONFIRM THAT SAUDI ARABIA IS 
SUDAN\'S LARGEST TRADE PARTNER.  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS 
OF 1989, SUDANESE EXPORTS--LARGELY LIVESTOCK (CAMELS AND 
GOATS), SESAME SEEDS AND SORGHUM--TOTALED 276,624,000 
POUNDS (USDOLS 22,674,000) AND IMPORTS--PETROLEUM 
PRODUCTS AND TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT--CAME TO 
316,627,000 POUNDS (USDOLS 25,953,000).  SAUDIS HAVE ALSO 
BEEN IMPORTANT PRIVATE INVESTORS IN SUDAN, INCLUDING 
PRINCE MOHAMMAD AL FAISAL (FAISAL ISLAMIC BANK), SHEIKH 
MAHFOUZ SALEM BIN MAHFOUZ (SAUDI-SUDANESE BANK), SHEIKH 
ABDEL LATIF GHORAB (DALLAH AL-BARAKA GROUP), SHEIKH OMER 
BIN LADEN (BIN LADEN COMPANIES) AND IBRAHIM AL-AFFANDI. 
ALTHOUGH SAUDI INVESTORS HAVE BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY COURTED BY 
THE RCC PRIVATELY AND AT THE RECENT INVESTMENT 
CONFERENCE, BUSINESSMEN REPORT THAT SAUDIS AND OTHER ARAB 
INVESTORS HAVE EXHIBITED A MARKED RELUCTANCE TO RISK 
THEIR FUNDS IN SUDAN.  SAUDI PRIVATE INVESTMENT SEEMS TO 
BE SHRINKING RATHER THAN EXPANDING. 
 
26.  SUDAN\'S LINKS TO SAUDI ARABIA ARE BOTH STRENGTHENED 
AND WEAKENED BY ISLAMIC CONNECTIONS.  ALL BUT THE MOST 
SECULAR OF SUDANESE MUSLIMS PARTICIPATE AT LEAST ONCE IN 
THE HAJ, THE PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA.  SAUDI ARABIA ALSO 
CONTRIBUTES SUBSTANTIALLY TO ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS IN 
SUDAN INCLUDING AN ISLAMIC INSTITUTE IN KHARTOUM. 
PARADOXICALLY, SUDAN\'S RELIGIOUS TENDENCIES ARE AMONG THE 
ELEMENTS THAT MOST DISCONCERT THE SAUDIS.  RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS OF THE PURIST WAHABI SECT IN SAUDI ARABIA FROWN 
ON MYSTICAL MUSLIM PRACTICES COMMON IN SUDAN INCLUDING 
VENERATION OF SAINTLY FOREFATHERS, CONSULTATIONS WITH 
LIVING FAKIS (HOLY MEN) AND MAGICAL (FORTUNE TELLING, 
HEALING) FORMS OF FOLK RELIGION.  POLITICALLY, THE SAUDIS 
DISDAIN ISLAMIC COMPETITION ARISING FROM SUFI SECTS AND 
THE INDIGENOUS NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT.  BECAUSE ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM HAS OFTEN INCLUDED AN ANTI-SAUDI STRAIN, 
THEY REPORTEDLY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MILITANT 
PROCLIVITIES, INCLUDING IRANIAN SYMPATHIES, APPARENT IN 
SOME SUDANESE OFFICIALS.  THIS ALSO REFLECTS LACK OF 
SAUDI ENTHUSIASM FOR SUPPORTING ANY ARAB COUNTRY WHICH 
ATTEMPTS TO FOLLOW A STRICTER FORM OF ISLAM THAN THAT OF 
THE KEEPER OF THE HOLY CITIES.  SAUDIS ARE ALSO SAID TO 
BE DISTRESSED AT THE FUROR IN SUDAN OVER THE HUDUD, WHICH 
DRAWS UNWANTED ATTENTION TO SAUDI APPLICATION OF SHARIA 
LAW.  SAUDIS, DISTINGUISHING THEIR HOMOGENOUS MUSLIM 
NATION FROM A MIXED RELIGIOUS SOCIETY LIKE SUDAN, WOULD 
PREFER THAT SUDAN COMPROMISE ON SHARIA TO PRODUCE PEACE, 
RELIGIOUS HARMONY AND STABILITY.  SUDAN\'S ASSOCIATIONS 
WITH RADICAL LIBYA ONLY AGGRAVATE SAUDI DISCOMFORT WITH 
SUDAN, A DISCOMFORT THAT HAS ALREADY DIMINISHED SAUDI 
ASSISTANCE FOR SUDAN. 
 
IRAQ 
 
27.  THE EARLY LOVEFEST BETWEEN THE RCC AND SADDAM 
HUSSEIN, MUCH OF IT COUCHED IN SECRECY, SEEMS SOMETHING 
OF AN ANAMOLY, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN WHY IT HAS NOW COOLED 
SOMEWHAT.  SADDAM, AFTER ALL, RULES A SECULAR STATE WARY 
OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS (AN IRAQI DISSIDENT BELONGING 
TO AL-DAWA WAS MURDERED IN 1988 BY THE IRAQIS IN THE 
LOBBY OF KHARTOUM\'S HILTON HOTEL), WHILE THE RCC, BACKED 
BY THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT, HAS PURGED AND ARRESTED 
HUNDREDS OF SUDANESE SECULARISTS.  VISITS BY RCC MEMBERS 
OMAR AL-BASHIR AND MOHAMMAD AL-KHALIFA, HOWEVER, WERE 
WARMLY RECEIVED BY SADDAM AND GOS APPEALS FOR MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE SPLA TOOK KURMUK, WERE 
GENEROUSLY REWARDED WITH TWO SOVIET AN-12 AIRCRAFT, AND 
SHIPMENTS OF AMMUNITION AND SMALL ARMS.  A NUMBER OF 
THEORIES HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BY SUDANESE TO EXPLAIN 
SADDAM\'S FRIENDLINESS.  CERTAINLY SADDAM, LIKE MUBARAK, 
DESPISED SADIQ AL-MAHDI, WHO FLIRTED WITH THE IRANIANS, 
AND THUS HAD REASON TO WELCOME HIS REPLACEMENT.  SADDAM 
ALSO MAY HAVE FELT AN AFFINITY TO A GOVERNMENT OF 
SOLDIERS, CERTAINLY MORE SO THAN TO THE FREEWHEELING 
DEMOCRACY THAT PRECEDED IT.  FURTHERMORE, SADDAM, WITH 
VISIONS OF GRANDEUR AS A PAN-ARAB LEADER AND REELING FROM 
CRITICISM FOR HIS POLICIES IN LEBANON, MAY HAVE BEEN 
SUSCEPTIBLE TO GOS BLANDISHMENTS.  FINALLY, SADDAM, 
PERHAPS GRATEFUL FOR THE HELP OF SUDANESE \"VOLUNTEERS\" 
(TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MANUAL LABORERS IN IRAQ ENLISTED OR 
WERE COERCED IN THE WAR EFFORT) IN THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR AND, 
BECAUSE OF HIS OWN EXPERIENCE, SYMPATHISED WITH A 
SUDANESE WAR LARGELY AGAINST NONARABS.  ALL OF THE ABOVE 
WERE PROBABLY FACTORS. 
 
28.  SADDAM\'S AMICABLE RELATIONS WITH THE RCC PUT IRAQ\'S 
KEY INSTITUTION IN SUDAN, THE IRAQI BAATHIST PARTY, IN A 
PREDICAMENT.  COMPOSED LARGELY OF SUDANESE STUDENTS WHO 
ONCE STUDIED IN BAGHDAD, THE BAATHIST PARTY, WHICH IS 
SMALL BUT INFLUENTIAL AMONG SUDANESE PROFESSIONALS, 
STAUNCHLY SUPPORTS SECULARIST RULE AND OPPOSES THE NIF. 
BAATHISTS ENJOYED SOMEWHAT OF A GRACE PERIOD FROM 
SECURITY OFFICIALS AFTER THE COUP WITH ARRESTS OF ONLY A 
FEW PARTY LEADERS.  INCLINED TO JOIN THE COMMUNISTS AND 
OTHER SECULARISTS IN OPPOSITION TO THE RCC, PARTY MEMBERS 
WERE TORN BETWEEN LOYALTY TO IRAQ AND SECULARIST 
IDEOLOGY.  IT THUS VACILLATED BEFORE JOINING OTHER 
PARTIES AND UNIONS AND SIGNING AN OPPOSITION CHARTER 
AGAINST THE RCC.  THE UNCERTAINTY WAS EVIDENT AGAIN AT 
THE TIME OF THE DOCTORS STRIKE IN DECEMBER 1989, AS MANY 
BAATHISTS, ESPECIALLY IN LEGAL CIRCLES, WERE SAID TO BE 
RELUCTANT TO GET INVOLVED.  BAATHISTS, ALONG WITH OTHER 
LEFTISTS, WERE ARRESTED IN LARGE NUMBERS AFTER THE 
STRIKE.  AROUND THE SAME TIME, IRAQ SEEMS TO HAVE JOINED 
OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES IN THEIR DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE 
GOS, AND STOPPED SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE.  BAATHIST 
CHAIRMAN TAISEER MUTASSIR RECENTLY TOLD A FELLOW ATTORNEY 
THAT IRAQ PLANNED TO CUT ALL ITS AID TO SUDAN. 
 
THE PENINSULAR STATES 
 
29.  FOLLOWING EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA, THE LARGEST NUMBER 
OF EXPATRIATE SUDANESE WORK AND RESIDE IN THE UNITED ARAB 
EMIRATES.  ACCORDING TO ONE SUDANESE ESTIMATE, THERE ARE 
BETWEEN 50,000 AND 100,000 SUDANESE IN THE UAE.  MOST ARE 
MIDDLE CLASS BUSINESSMEN, CIVIL SERVANTS, TEACHERS AND 
PROFESSIONALS.  TWO CURRENT CABINET MINISTERS WERE 
WORKING IN ABU DHABI WHEN THEY WERE PICKED FOR THE 
CABINET.  KAMAL HAMZA, EX-MAYOR OF DUBAI AND NOW 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RULER\'S DIWAN, HEADS A DISTINGUISHED 
SUDANESE COMMUNITY IN DUBAI.  THIS EXPATRIATE PRESENCE 
HAS FOCUSED SOME UAE ATTENTION ON SUDAN.  THE ABU DHABI 
FUND HAD COMMITTED USDOLS 239,580,000 TO SUDANESE 
PROJECTS THROUGH 1988.  SHEIKH ZAYID CONTRIBUTED USDOLS 
35 MILLION TO SUDAN AFTER GENERAL OMAR PAID A VISIT, AND 
THE UAE NAVY REPORTEDLY TRAINS SUDANESE OFFICERS.  THERE 
ARE ALSO SAID TO BE A NUMBER OF SUDANESE IN THE POLICE 
FORCES OF THE VARIOUS EMIRATES.  A RECENT VISITOR TO THE 
UAE, WHO MET A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, REPORTED 
COINSIDERABLE DISMAY OVER SUDAN.  SHEIKH SULTAN OF 
SHARJAH (WHO HAS DONATED CONSIDERABLE MONEY TO THE 
UNIVERSITY OF KHARTOUM INCLUDING SHARJAH HALL) BLUNTLY 
TOLD THE VISITOR THAT HE AND OTHER OFFICIALS INTENDED TO 
AVOID ASSISTANCE TO THE GOS UNTIL IT \"SHAPED UP.\" 
 
30.  KUWAIT ALSO HAS ATTRACTED SUDANESE PROFESSIONALS, 
THOUGH IN LESS NUMBERS THAN THE UAE--ABOUT 20,000 TO 
30,000.  KUWAIT\'S MAJOR INPUT IN SUDAN HAS BEEN THROUGH 
THE KUWAIT FUND WHICH HAS PROVIDED LARGE AMOUNTS OF AID 
FOR DEVELOPMENT, MOSTLY AGRO-INDUSTRIAL (E.G. KENANA 
SUGAR FACTORY, A MAJOR POULTRY FARM), PROJECTS.  USDOLS 
809,353,000 WAS COMMITTED THROUGH 1988, SECOND ONLY TO 
THE SAUDIS.  KUWAIT HAS UNTIL RECENTLY SUPPLIED OIL. 
SUDANESE OFFICIALS REPORT THAT KUWAITI INTEREST IN SUDAN 
IS ALSO DECLINING.  ECHOING THEIR ARAB COLLEAGUES, 
KUWAITIS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE GOS IS ISOLATING 
ITSELF INTERNATIONALLY AND MAKING LITTLE PROGRESS IN 
ECONOMIC REFORM. 
 
31.  ABOUT FOUR TO SIX THOUSAND SUDANESE, MOSTLY 
TEACHERS, WORK IN OMAN AND NORTH YEMEN.  THESE COUNTRIES 
HAVE PROVIDED LITTLE DIRECT ASSISTANCE, THOUGH OMAN MADE 
A SMALL CONTRIBUTION AFTER A VISIT BY OMAR AL-BASHIR. 
THE SUDANESE HAVE HAD A LENGTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
YEMENIS--MANY ATTENDED SCHOOL IN KHARTOUM, OTHERS WORKED 
AS PEDDLERS.  INTERESTINGLY, SUDANESE TEND TO PICK 
YEMENIS, WHO ARE PERCEIVED AS HONEST AND UNPRETENTIOUS, 
AS ARABS WITH WHOM THEY ARE MOST COMFORTABLE.  QATAR, 
ANOTHER DISPLEASED ARAB STATE, REFUSED GENERAL OMAR\'S 
PLEA FOR AID AND REPORTEDLY WANTS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF 
SUDANESE EMPLOYED IN QATAR.  ROUNDING OUT THE PENINSULAR 
STATES, SUDAN HAS LITTLE COMMERCIAL AND NO DIPLOMATIC 
PRESENCE IN BAHRAIN OR ADEN. 
 
PERIPHERY STATES 
 
32.  SUDAN\'S MODEST RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE REMAINING ARAB 
STATES, PERCEIVED AS DISTANT AND UNLIKELY DONORS, RARELY 
CONCERN THE GOS.  EXCEPT FOR A COTERIE OF AMERICAN 
UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT ALUMINI NOW IN THEIR 40\'S, FEW 
SUDANESE HAVE VENTURED TO THE LEVANT.  LEBANON IS CITED 
IN CONVERSATION ONLY AS A WARNING OF WHAT DECENTRALIZED 
LOYALTIES AND INTOLERANCE MIGHT PRODUCE IN SUDAN.  THE 
ARAB BAR ASSOCIATION\'S ANNUAL MEETING IN 1989 IN DAMASCUS 
WAS THE FIRST VISIT TO SYRIA BY MEMBERS OF THE SUDANESE 
DELEGATION.  SYRIA GIVES NO AID TO SUDAN, THOUGH RELIEF 
ASSISTANCE GIVEN IN 1988 IS DRAWING ATTENTION AS IT IS 
THE BASIS FOR A MISAPPROPIATION AND CORRUPTION CASE 
AGAINST FORMER STATE COUNCIL MEMBER IDRIS AL-BANNA. 
JORDAN HAS DONATED SOME MEDICINE AND SENDS A ROTATING 
MEDICAL TEAM TO WORK IN DARFUR.  THE \"PALESTINE 
AMBASSADOR\" ACTIVELY BUT NOT TOO SUCCESSFULLY SEEKS TO 
SPARK SUDANESE INTEREST IN THE INTIFADA.  HE HAS BEEN 
GIVEN PERMISSION TO CONSTRUCT A PALESTINE UNIVERSITY IN 
KHARTOUM.  YASSIR ARAFAT\'S OCCASIONAL VISITS ATTRACT 
LITTLE ATTENTION. 
 
33.  SUDAN ALSO HAS FEW TRADE OR OTHER LINKS WITH THE 
MAHGREB STATES.  MOROCCAN LINKS, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE 
CONFINED TO 60 STUDENTS STUDYING IN MOROCCO AND A PRIVATE 
BANK\'S FINANCING OF AN AGRICULTURE PROJECT.  NONE OF THE 
DIPLOMATS FROM THE MAGHREB SEEM TO PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO 
LOCAL AFFAIRS.  THE SOMALI EMBASSYS ONLY APPARENT 
FUNCTION IN SUDAN IS TO ISSUE REFUGEE DOCUMENTS TO 
ETHIOPIAN REBELS.  MANY SUDANESE ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF 
DJIBOUTI OR MAURITANIA, NEITHER OF WHICH HAVE AN EMBASSY 
IN KHARTOUM. 
 
34.  COMMENT.  SUDAN DELIGHTS IN TRUMPETING ITS ROLE AS A 
BRIDGE BETWEEN AFRICA AND THE ARAB COUNTRIES.  THIS 
COMMENDABLE THOUGH UNATTAINED IDEAL OVERLOOKS A 
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM--SUDAN\'S BRIDGES TO BOTH ARABS AND 
AFRICANS ARE IN DISREPAIR.  IRONICALLY WHILE ARAB 
RELATIONS WITH THE RCC HAVE GRADUALLY WORSENED UNTIL THEY 
HAVE RETURNED TO, OR EVEN BECOME WORSE THAN, THEIR 
PRE-COUP STATUS, GENERAL OMAR HAS MANAGED, DESPITE 
CONTINUING CONFLICT WITH THE SPLA AND ALLEGATIONS OF NIF 
INFLUENCE, TO REPAIR RELATIONS WITH SOME OF HIS AFRICAN 
NEIGHBORS INCLUDING KENYA, ZAIRE, AND THE C.A.R., DAMAGED 
BY SADIQ. 
 
35.  COMMENT CONTINUED.  WHILE THE SPECTER OF PAN-ARABISM 
WHICH LOOMS IN ANY DISCUSSION OF AN ARAB CONSENSUS IS 
REVILED BY SOUTHERN SUDANESE, BROAD ARAB COLLABORATION 
TODAY, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, IS NOT INIMICAL TO SOUTHERN 
INTERESTS OR TO THOSE OF THE U.S.  WITH THE REGRETTABLE 
EXCEPTION OF LIBYA, ARAB NATIONS WITH CONNECTIONS TO 
SUDAN WANT PEACE, STABILITY AND ECONOMIC REFORM IN 
SUDAN.  THEY RECOGNIZE THE NECESSITY OF, AND THEIR 
LEADERS HAVE ENCOURAGED, COMPROMISE ON SHARIA, ADJUSTMENT 
OF POLICIES TO BROADEN GOS POLITICAL APPEAL, AND 
COOPERATION WITH THE IMF FOR REAL ECONOMIC REFORM. 
MENDING ITS ARAB BRIDGES MAY WELL PROVE A KEY TO 
IMPROVING SUDAN\'S FORTUNES.

          THAN IN CHARGE 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF JUNE 30, 
1989, WHEN ELEMENTS OF SUDAN\'S ARMORED AND AIRBORNE 
FORCES SEIZED POWER FROM PRIME MINISTER SADIQ AL MAHDI, 
IT WAS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT THE LONG-AWAITED TAKEOVER BY 
THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT HAD FINALLY TAKEN PLACE. 
HOWEVER, IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR THAT THE COUP HAD BEEN 
ORGANIZED AND CARRIED OUT BY A SELECT FEW, PERHAPS EVEN 
LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED OFFICERS AND MEN, NOT EVEN FULLY 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TWO UNITS PRIMARILY INVOLVED.  THE 
JUNTA QUICKLY ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A REVOLUTIONARY 
COMMAND COUNCIL (RCC) COMPOSED OF FIFTEEN MILITARY 
OFFICERS RANGING IN RANK FROM BRIGADIER TO MAJOR.  SOME 
OFFICERS SENIOR TO THE RCC MEMBERS WERE RETIRED.  DESPITE 
THE RETIREMENTS AND TRANSFERS, IT APPEARED THAT SUDAN\'S 
MILITARY WAS FIRMLY IN CHARGE OF THE GOVERNMENT.  MANY 
RETIRED OFFICERS WERE CALLED BACK TO ACTIVE DUTY AND 
ASSIGNED CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION POSTS SUCH AS REGIONAL 
GOVERNOR.  OTHERS WHO HAD REMAINED ON ACTIVE DUTY WERE 
PROMOTED.  MOST OF THE NEW \"LEADERS\" HAD SIGNIFICANT 
COMBAT EXPERIENCE IN THE SOUTH AND ALL APPEARED TO 
SUPPORT GENERAL OMAR AL BASHIR AND THE RCC. 
 
3.  TEN MONTHS AFTER THE COUP, THE MILITARY 
ESTABLISHMENT, AS HAVE OTHERS, HAS BEEN FORCED TO 
REEVALUATE ITS POSITION REGARDING THE GOS.  AS MANY AS 
ONE THOUSAND OFFICERS (TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF 
THE CORPS) HAVE BEEN SACKED AND THOSE REMAINING ARE 
DISILLUSIONED BY THE DISTINCT ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST HUE 
OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE RECENT UNITY DECLARATION WITH 
LIBYA.  THEY ARE ALSO UNHAPPY WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
FAILURE TO MOVE DECISIVELY TO END THE WAR IN THE SOUTH. 
NEARLY ONE HUNDRED ACTIVE AND RETIRED OFFICERS ARE IN 
PRISON FOR TWO SEPARATE COUP PLOTS AND TWENTY EIGHT HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN EXECUTED.  RUMORS OF CONTINUING PLOTTING 
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT ABOUND, BUT THE RCC AND ITS 
SECURITY APPARATUS HAVE REPORTEDLY INFILTRATED UNITS FROM 
THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST LEVELS, EFFECTIVELY PREEMPTING 
ANY POTENTIALLY DECISIVE ACTION.  FROM APPARENT POWER TO 
OBVIOUS EMASCULATION, SUDAN\'S MILITARY IS NOW MORE IN 
CHECK THAN IN CHARGE AND FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
A SMALL GROUP IN CHARGE 
 
4.  IN FEBRUARY 1989 WHEN SUDAN\'S MILITARY LEADERS GAVE 
PRIME MINISTER SADIQ AL MAHDI AN ULTIMATUM REGARDING THE 
WAR IN THE SOUTH, IT WAS CLEAR TO MANY OBSERVERS THAT 
SADIQ\'S DAYS WERE NUMBERED.  THE MILITARY HAD BECOME 
INCREASINGLY UNHAPPY WITH THE GOVERNMENT\'S LACK OF 
DECISIVENESS AND PETTY PARTISAN BICKERING, THE CONTINUING 
EROSION OF THE ECONOMY, AND THE GENERAL MALAISE AFFECTING 
VIRTUALLY ALL SECTORS OF SUDANESE SOCIETY.  THUS, ON JUNE 
30, 1989 WHEN RADIO OMDURMAN ANNOUNCED THAT THE MILITARY 
HAD DEPOSED SADIQ, MOST SUDANESE WERE ACTUALLY RELIEVED. 
WIDELY REGARDED AS THE MOST RATIONAL, MOST OBJECTIVE, AND 
ONLY TRULY NATIONALIST GROUP IN SUDAN, THE MILITARY, IT 
WAS BELIEVED, WOULD END THE WAR IN THE SOUTH AND GET THE 
COUNTRY MOVING. 
 
5.  IT SOON BECAME CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT THE MILITARY HIGH 
COMMAND HAD NO ROLE IN THE COUP.  THE COUP HAD BEEN 
CARRIED OUT BY A FEW BRIGADIERS AND COLONELS WITH PERHAPS 
LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED SOLDIERS.  A FORMER PARATROOP 
COMMANDER, BRIG OMAR AL BASHIR EMERGED AS THE LEADER OF 
THE REVOLUTION.  ALTHOUGH HE QUICKLY NAMED HIMSELF AND 
FOURTEEN OTHER OFFICERS TO A REVOLUTION COMMAND COUNCIL 
(RCC) TO RULE THE COUNTRY, CONFLICT WITH THE HIGH COMMAND 
WAS IMMEDIATELY EVIDENT.  MOST OF THE RCC MEMBERS HAD 
LITTLE COMMAND OR COMBAT EXPERIENCE.  THEY WERE PRIMARILY 
STAFF AND SUPPORT OFFICERS AND NOT ONE, INCLUDING OMAR 
HIMSELF, WAS WELL KNOWN WITHIN THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT. 
 
CONFLICT WITHIN THE MILITARY 
 
6.  RUMORS SPREAD QUICKLY OF A POSSIBLE COUNTERCOUP.  THE 
FACT THAT OMAR AND HIS GROUP SUCCEEDED BY DECEIVING UNIT 
COMMANDERS, PLAYING THEM OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER AND 
LEADING THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE ACTING WITH THE 
APPROVAL AND SUPPORT OF THE HIGH COMMAND, UNDERMINED THE 
REVOLUTION\'S LEGITIMACY.  MANY BELIEVED THEN, AS THEY DO 
NOW, THAT OMAR, AIDED AND ABETTED BY THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC 
FRONT (NIF), MADE HIS MOVE WHEN AND HOW HE DID TO THWART 
OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS FROM CARRYING OUT THEIR OWN COUP. 
THEY ALSO ALLEGE THAT THE COUP WAS DESIGNED TO THWART THE 
PEACE PROCESS WHICH LOOKED PROMISING AND WHICH THE NIF 
OPPOSED.  WHETHER THE NIF WAS INVOLVED OR NOT IS STILL 
QUESTIONABLE, BUT THE PREEMPTION SCENARIO HELPS EXPLAIN 
WHY THERE WAS NO OPPOSITION TO THE COUP--NO ONE REALLY 
KNEW WHO WAS IN CHARGE AND VIRTUALLY EVERYONE SUPPORTED 
ONE COUP PLOTTER OR ANOTHER. 
 
7.  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT WITHIN THE 
MILITARY REPORTEDLY WAS THE 7TH ARMORED DIVISION 
COMMANDER, MAJOR GENERAL MIRGHANI YASIN BABIKIR, A WELL 
RESPECTED OFFICER WHO MANY BELIEVED HAD HIS OWN PLANS. 
HE TOO HAD BEEN DUPED BY OMAR AND HAD IN FACT MADE OMAR\'S 
SUCCESS POSSIBLE BY COMMITTING HIS DUTY OFFICER, MAJOR 
IBRAHIM SHAMS EL DIN, TO BRING FIFTEEN TANKS INTO THE 
CITY FROM THEIR BASE AT AL SHAGARA.  LITTLE DID GENERAL 
BABIKIR KNOW THAT SHAMS EL DIN WAS IN LEAGUE WITH OMAR. 
WITHOUT THE TANKS TO COMMAND KEY POINTS IN AND AROUND THE 
CITY, THE COUP PROBABLY WOULD HAVE FAILED.  THE ISOLATION 
AND SUBSEQUENT SWIFT ARREST OF THE SPAF HIGH COMMAND ALSO 
PREVENTED THE ISSUANCE OF ORDERS TO SUPPRESS BASHIR\'S 
COHORTS. 
 
8.  OMAR REASSURED GENERAL BABIKIR AND OTHER SENIOR 
OFFICERS OF HIS NATIONALISM AND UNSELFISH COMMITMENT TO 
SUDAN.  HE ALSO ASSURED THEM HE WOULD NOT POLITICIZE THE 
MILITARY AND THAT HE WOULD KEEP IT ABOVE THE SECTARIAN 
SQUABBLES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTIES.  PROFESSIONAL 
OFFICERS ADOPTED A \"WAIT AND SEE\" ATTITUDE. 
 
SENIOR OFFICERS OUT 
 
9.  WHILE REASSURING THE MILITARY ON ONE HAND, THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO DISCHARGE OFFICERS SENIOR 
TO THE RCC MEMBERS.  VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE COMMAND 
STRUCTURE WAS PENSIONED OFF ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 
THREE HUNDRED OTHER OFFICERS TO INCLUDE MAJOR GENERALS, 
BRIGADIERS, AND A FEW COLONELS.  SEVERAL OFFICERS 
SYMPATHETIC TO THE REVOLUTION WERE PROMOTED AND A FEW WHO 
HAD BEEN RETIRED WERE RECALLED TO SERVE AS REGIONAL 
GOVERNORS AND IN OTHER ROLES IN THE GOVERNMENT.  THE NEW 
COMMAND STRUCTURE JUSTIFIED THE RCC\'S ACTIONS IN MILITARY 
TERMS, INDICATING THAT OFFICERS SENIOR TO THE MEMBERS OF 
THE RCC COULD NOT TAKE ORDERS FROM THEM.  RETIRED 
OFFICERS IN SUDAN RECEIVE NINETY PERCENT PAY SO THERE WAS 
LITTLE IMPACT ON THEIR FINANCIAL WELL-BEING.  IN MAY 
1990, HOWEVER, RETIRED OFFICERS LOST SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS 
INCLUDING ACCESS TO MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND FUEL 
SUPPLIES FOR PERSONAL VEHICLES. 
 
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE RCC AND THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT 
 
10.  PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, AROSE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BETWEEN 
THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT AND THE RCC.  THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT, IN ATTEMPTING TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY AND DEAL 
WITH THE MANY NON-MILITARY PROBLEMS FACING IT, PAID LESS 
AND LESS ATTENTION TO THE CONCERNS OF THE MILITARY 
ESTABLISHMENT.  RUMORS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS CONTROLLED 
OR HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) 
FURTHER UNDERMINED THE RCC.  THE MILITARY, FOR THE FIRST 
TIME, BEGAN TO FEEL THE THREAT OF POLITICIZATION. 
HOWEVER, THEY CONTINUED TO \"WAIT AND SEE,\" THOUGH SEVERAL 
OFFICERS CLAIM THEY URGED GENERAL OMAR TO PURGE OR 
OTHERWISE CONTROL THE NIF INFLUENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
11.  DUE TO A GENUINE DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND PARTLY IN AN 
EFFORT TO APPEASE THE MILITARY, THE RCC ANNOUNCED A 
CONTINUATION OF THE CEASE-FIRE WITH THE SPLA/M AND 
ATTEMPTED TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE CIVIL WAR IN THE 
SOUTH.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE NEW GOVERNMENT BEGAN 
REINFORCING GARRISONS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH WITH ARMS 
PURCHASED FROM CHINA BY THE SADIQ GOVERNMENT.  ADDITIONAL 
SHIPMENTS OF SMALL ARMS AND AMMUNITION WERE ARRANGED WITH 
LIBYA AND IRAQ WHICH BEGAN TO MAKE DELIVERIES DIRECTLY 
INTO JUBA AS WELL AS KHARTOUM.  NEGOTIATING FROM A 
POSITION OF STRENGTH WAS THE WATCHWORD AND THE MILITARY 
ESTABLISHMENT APPEARED SATISFIED, CONVINCED OF THE RCC\'S 
SINCERITY. 
 
THE WAR IN THE SOUTH 
 
12.  NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SPLA/M DID NOT GO WELL AND IN 
LATE OCTOBER GARANG\'S FORCES ATTACKED AND TOOK THE BORDER 
TOWN OF KURMUK.  THE GOS RESPONDED BY BOMBING SEVERAL 
SOUTHERN TOWNS AND THE CEASE-FIRE EFFECTIVELY ENDED.  GOS 
FORCES RETOOK KURMUK IN LATE NOVEMBER, AFTER THE SPLA 
WITHDREW, BUT REBEL FORCES LAUNCHED SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS ON 
GOVERNMENT GARRISONS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH.  ADDITIONAL 
NEGOTIATIONS FAILED TO ACHIEVE A CEASE-FIRE AND THE SPLA 
BESIEGED YEI IN AN EFFORT TO TAKE ALL OF EASTERN 
EQUATORIA AND ISOLATE JUBA.  THEY ALSO BEGAN 
INDISCRIMINATE SHELLING OF JUBA.  REINFORCED BY TROOPS 
FROM JUBA, YEI HELD AND THE SPLA CAMPAIGN CAME TO A 
HALT.  ALTHOUGH FIGHTING CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, 
AND BOTH THE SPAF AND THE SPLA APPEAR TO BE MASSING 
TROOPS FOR A MAJOR CONFRONTATION IN UPPER NILE REGION, 
BOTH SIDES ARE AGAIN STALEMATED, ALTHOUGH SOME MIGHT 
ARGUE THAT THE SPLA NOW HAS THE UPPER HAND. 
 
PEOPLE\'S ARMY OR BUDDING ISLAMIC LEGION? 
 
13.  AS NIF INFLUENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT INCREASED, SO DID 
DISSATISFACTION WITHIN THE MILITARY.  TO PROTECT ITSELF 
FROM DISAFFECTED OFFICERS THE RCC INFILTRATED VIRTUALLY 
EVERY MILITARY UNIT WITH LOYALISTS, MANY WITH STRONG NIF 
SYMPATHIES.  AT THE SAME TIME, NIF SYMPATHIZERS WERE 
ADMITTED IN INCREASING NUMBERS TO OFFICER TRAINING 
SCHOOL.  BY EARLY APRIL 1990 SENIOR NIF MEMBERS TOLD 
EMBOFFS THAT AS MANY AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE OFFICER 
CORPS WERE NIF, UP FROM AN ESTIMATED LESS THAN FIVE 
PERCENT DURING THE SADIQ ERA.  FOLLOWING THE MARCH AND 
APRIL COUP ATTEMPTS, ANOTHER THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED 
OFFICERS WERE PURGED FROM THE MILITARY, INCREASING NIF 
AND OTHER LOYALIST CONTROL OF UNITS. 
 
14.  OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF MOST ARMY UNITS ARE STAFFED BY 
SOLDIERS AND NCOS FROM THE SOUTH.  MOST HAVE LITTLE 
COMMITMENT OR DEDICATION TO THE GOVERNMENT--THEY JOINED 
FOR THE SUGAR AND OTHER RATIONS GIVEN TO SOLDIERS, AS 
WELL AS THE SALARY.  ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE OFTEN ACQUITTED 
THEMSELVES WELL IN BATTLE, GENERALLY SURRENDERING ONLY 
WHEN THEIR FOOD AND AMMUNITION WERE DEPLETED, THEY HAVE 
LITTLE STOMACH FOR OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS.  AS WITH MORE 
OBVIOUS MERCENARIES, THEIR LOYALTY IS A FUNCTION OF THEIR 
PAY AND ALLOWANCES.  OFFICERS IN THE SOUTH ARE ALSO KNOWN 
FOR THEIR CORRUPTION WHICH NOT ONLY EARNS THEM THE ENMITY 
OF THE LOCAL POPULATION BUT ALSO FURTHER DIVIDES THEM 
FROM THEIR TROOPS.  NORTHERN, ARAB OFFICERS ARE 
REPORTEDLY LESS THAN COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR SUBORDINATES 
AND THIS FEELING OF UNEASE IS INCREASING AS THE OFFICER 
CORPS BECOME MORE AND MORE POLITICIZED. 
 
15.  OFFICERS ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE CURRENT HIGH 
COMMAND LACKS THE PERSONALITIES AND CLOUT TO TAKE ON THE 
RCC OVER ISSUES CONCERNING THE WELFARE OF THE OFFICER 
CORPS.  THIS IS A MARKED DEPARTURE FROM THE TRADITIONAL 
POLITICO-MILITARY EQUATION IN SUDAN.  THE MILITARY HAS 
ALSO NOT BEEN IMMUNE TO RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER LAWS AND 
REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE NEW GOVERNMENT.  MILITARY 
OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO OBSERVE CURFEW HOURS AND 
CURRENCY AND TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS.  ALTHOUGH FEW OFFICERS 
HAVE BEEN DISCIPLINED BY THE REGIME, (EXCEPT THOSE 
IMPLICATED IN COUP PLOTS OR ATTEMPTS), SEVERAL, INCLUDING 
THE CHIEF OF STAFF, HAVE RELATIVES WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED 
OR ROUGHED UP BY SECURITY OFFICIALS.  IN ALMOST ALL 
CASES, THE OFFICER\'S STATUS HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENT TO 
PROTECT THE RELATIVE. 
 
16.  TO AUGMENT THE ARMY, THE GOS IN LATE 1989 PASSED THE 
POPULAR DEFENSE ACT PROVIDING FOR THE LOCAL ESTABLISHMENT 
OF POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES (PDF) AND THE ARMING OF TRIBAL 
MILITIAS.  ALTHOUGH MILITIAS ARE NOW BETTER ARMED THAN 
EVER BEFORE, THE GOS EXERTS LITTLE CONTROL OVER THEM. 
POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES HAVE BEEN ALMOST COMPLETELY TAKEN 
OVER BY NIF ELEMENTS.  AS SUCH, ALTHOUGH NOMINALLY UNDER 
A MILITARY COMMANDER, THEY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT 
COUNTERFORCE TO THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT.  AS MANY AS 
TWO THOUSAND KHARTOUM RESIDENTS, MOSTLY NIF SYMPATHIZERS 
AND INCLUDING MANY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, WERE RECRUITED 
AND TRAINED IN THE PDF.  SEVERAL OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT 
MILITARY UNITS MAY EVENTUALLY BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE 
KHARTOUM AREA WHOSE SECURITY WILL BE PROVIDED FOR BY PDF 
FORCES ACTING AS A PALACE GUARD.  SUCH A CHANGE WOULD 
FURTHER REDUCE TRADITIONAL MILITARY INFLUENCE IN SUDAN. 
SO FAR, HOWEVER, THE NIF HAS ONLY BEEN MARGINALLY 
SUCCESSFUL IN THE PDF.  THERE IS LITTLE EMPATHY BETWEEN 
THEM AND THEIR TRAINERS AND MANY NIF RECRUITS HAVE 
ALREADY DESERTED DUE TO THE SPARTAN AND DISCIPLINED 
CONDITIONS IN PDF CAMPS. 
 
BUDGET/CAPABILITIES 
 
17.  ACTUAL MINISTRY OF DEFENSE EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 
YEAR 1988-1989 UNDER THE SADIQ GOVERNMENT TOTALLED 1.5 
BILLION SUDANESE POUNDS (333 MILLION USDOLS AT THE LEGAL 
RATE OF EXCHANGE).  THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1989-1990 
UNDER GENERAL OMAR ALLOCATES 3.6 BILLION SUDANESE POUNDS 
(800 MILLION USDOLS) FOR DEFENSE.  NEITHER OF THESE 
FIGURES INCLUDES THE APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION USDOLS WHICH 
THE GOS SAYS THAT IT SPENDS PER DAY IN WAGING THE WAR IN 
THE SOUTH.  ALTHOUGH THE INCREASE OF OVER 100 PERCENT IN 
DEFENSE SPENDING IS IMPRESSIVE, PLANNED EXPENDITURES IN 
THE MINISTRIES OF AGRICULTURE AND ENERGY ALSO DOUBLED, 
AND THE IRRIGATION MINISTRY SHOWS A 300 PERCENT 
INCREASE.  DESPITE THEIR BACKGROUNDS, THE RCC HAS NOT 
FAVORED THE MILITARY OVER OTHER MINISTRIES.  IN ADDITION, 
ACCORDING TO RCC ECONOMIC COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, COL. SALAH 
EL DIN KARRAR, THERE WILL BE NO PROMOTIONS OR PAY RAISES 
IN THE MILITARY FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. 
 
18.  SHORTLY AFTER ASSUMING POWER, GENERAL OMAR\'S 
GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO RECEIVE TANKS, ARMORED CARS, AND AIR 
DEFENSE AND FIELD ARTILLERY FROM THE PEOPLE\'S REPUBLIC OF 
CHINA.  ALTHOUGH CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE 
CAPABILITIES OF THE SPAF, THIS EQUIPMENT HAD BEEN ORDERED 
BY SADIQ AND FINANCED BY SAUDI ARABIA (THROUGH A THIRD 
COUNTRY) PRIOR TO JUNE 30.  SMALL ARMS AND AMMUNITION AND 
AIR TRANSPORTS WERE PROVIDED BY BOTH LIBYA AND IRAQ AT 
OMAR\'S REQUEST.  OTHERWISE, THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS DONE 
LITTLE TO ENHANCE OR STRENGTHEN THE MILITARY. 
RECRUITMENT INTO MILITARY UNITS, AFTER AN INITIAL SURGE, 
HAS NOW TAPERED OFF IN FAVOR OF THE PDF. 
 
19.  SPAF STRENGTH HAS REMAINED CONSTANT WITH AN ESTIMATE 
OF APPROXIMATELY 4,000-6,000 OFFICERS AND 65,000-70,000 
ENLISTED MEN AND WOMEN.  THERE ARE 55,000-60,000 IN THE 
ARMY; 3,000 IN THE AIR FORCE; 3,000 IN THE AIR DEFENSE 
FORCE; AND 1,500 IN THE NAVY.  ORDER OF BATTLE INCLUDES 
FOUR INFANTRY DIVISIONS; ONE ARMORED DIVISION; ONE 
ENGINEER DIVISION; ONE AIRBORNE DIVISION CONSISTING OF 
ONE BRIGADE, SPECIAL FORCES AND RECONNAISANCE UNITS; 
FIELD AND AIR DEFENSE ARTILLERY UNITS; AND A 
TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLY CORPS.  THE AIR FORCE HAS 
THIRTY-THREE OPERATIONAL SOVIET AND CHINESE MIG-21, 
MIG-23, F-5, AND  F-6 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT; SIX C-130 
TRANSPORTS (FIVE OPERATIONAL); THIRTY-FOUR U.S., FRENCH, 
AND SOVIET HELICOPTERS; AND FIVE OPERATIONAL SOVIET 
TRANSPORTS.  NAVAL EQUIPMENT INCLUDES EIGHTEEN COASTAL 
PATROL CRAFT, MOSTLY PROVIDED BY YUGOSLAVIA.  ALL SENIOR 
SUDANESE NAVAL OFFICERS WERE TRAINED IN YUGOSLAVIA, BUT 
NAVAL OPERATIONAL READINESS REMAINS VERY LOW. 
 
COMMENT 
 
20.  WHILE SUDAN\'S MILITARY APPEARS LITTLE CHANGED AS A 
RESULT OF THE JUNE 30, 1989 COUP, THE MILITARY 
ESTABLISHMENT IS RADICALLY DIFFERENT.  PREMATURE 
RETIREMENTS, PROMOTIONS WITHOUT REGARD TO SENIORITY, AND 
ASSIGNMENTS WITHOUT REGARD TO ABILITY HAVE SERIOUSLY 
UNDERMINED TRADITIONAL MILITARY VALUES.  TOGETHER WITH 
OBVIOUS POLITICIZATION OF THE OFFICER CORPS, THEY HAVE 
ERODED PROFESSIONALISM PERHAPS BEYOND REPAIR. 
 
21.  EXECUTIONS FOR THE APRIL 1990 COUP ATTEMPT FOLLOWING 
HASTILY ORGANIZED CLOSED TRIALS WITH NO REGARD TO DUE 
PROCESS HAVE FURTHER ISOLATED THE GOS FROM THE MILITARY. 
DISAFFECTION IN THE ARMED FORCES REMAINS HIGH AND IS 
LIKELY TO INCREASE.  COUP PLOTTING CONTINUES AND FUTURE 
ATTEMPTS TO DEPOSE GENERAL OMAR AND THE RCC ARE ALMOST 
CERTAIN. 
 
22.  WHILE THE CURRENT GOS IS CONTROLLED BY CAREER 
MILITARY OFFICERS AND NO EFFORT HAS BEEN SPARED TO 
PROVIDE THE SPAF WITH THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO 
PROSECUTE THE WAR IN THE SOUTH, SUDAN\'S MILITARY IS FAR 
FROM IN CHARGE OF THE COUNTRY.  THE SPLA STILL CONTROLS 
THE MAJORITY OF THE SOUTH AND NIF INFLUENCE IN THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS DRIVEN A WEDGE BETWEEN THE RCC AND THEIR 
FORMER COMRADES IN ARMS.  SUDAN MAY HAVE A MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT, BUT FOR THE TIME BEING THE MILITARY ITSELF 
HAS BEEN CHECKED AND GENERAL OMAR APPEARS TO BE SETTING 
UP THE MATE.

THAT THE BASHIR GOVERNMENT WILL REMAIN IN POWER FOR THE

MR. MOHAMED ABDEL WANIS, EGYPT 
MR. JONE BOS, THE NETHERLANDS

4.  ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES ATTRIBUTED OMAR\'S STRENGTH TO 
THE UBIQUITOUS SECURITY SERVICE AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
DEMONSTRATED WILL TO TAKE DRASTIC ACTION AGAINST 
OPPONENTS.  THE SUDANESE, THEY AVERRED, HAVE BEEN COWED 
AND POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE LEADERSHIP ELIMINATED FOR THE 
TIME BEING.  THAT SAID, THEY BELIEVE THAT OMAR CANNOT 
REST EASILY; THAT HE WILL ULTIMATELY BE REPLACED BUT NOT 
IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. 
 
5.  THEY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GROWING NIF INFLUENCE AND 
BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE NIF ATTEMPTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE 
MILITARY (WHICH THEY CONSIDER INEVITABLE), THE REACTION 
WILL BE VIOLENT AND BLOODY WITH OMAR AND THE NIF BOTH 
BEING DEPOSED.  ABDEL WANIS (EGYPT) WAS THE MOST 
EXPANSIVE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE GROUP, ESPECIALLY 
REGARDING CONTINUING LOW LEVEL DISCONTENT WITHIN SUDAN\'S 
MILITARY.  HE DID, HOWEVER, PERHAPS IN RECOGNITION OF 
EGYPTIAN POLICY, OVEREMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF THE NATIONAL 
ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) IN THE GOS.

STRONGER ROLE FOR THE FUNDAMENTALIST NATIONAL ISLAMIC 
FRONT (NIF) IN SECURITY OPERATIONS.  MAHGOUB ALSO 
CONFIRMED THAT NIF LEADERS ARE MEETING OFTEN WITH 
SUDANESE CHIEF OF STATE GEN. OMAR HASSAN AL-BASHIR.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  DR. MAHGOUB, WHO CLAIMS HE RECEIVED HIS INFORMATION 
FROM SOURCES SYMPATHETIC TO THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FORUM 
(NDF), AN UMBRELLA GROUP FOR OPPONENTS OF THE BASHIR 
GOVERNMENT, TOLD POLOFF THAT A GOS COMMITTEE CALLED THE 
\"NATIONAL DEFENSE COUNCIL\" MET SHORTLY BEFORE GEN. OMAR\'S 
RECENT VISIT TO THE U.S.  ACCORDING TO MAHGOUB, THIS 
GROUP DATES FROM BEFORE THE JUNE 30, 1989, COUP AND IS 
INTENDED TO EXERCISE A GENERAL INFLUENCE OVER NATIONAL 
SECURITY CONCERNS.  ITS MEMBERS ARE:  THE MINISTERS OF 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS, FINANCE, AND INTERIOR; THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL; THE STATE MINISTER OF DEFENSE; THE SUDANESE 
PEOPLE\'S ARMED FORCES (SPAF) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND THREE 
OF HIS PRINCIPAL COLLEAGUES (INCLUDING THE DEPUTY CHIEFS 
OF STAFF FOR OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION); AND GEN. 
OMAR, WHO PRESIDED AT THIS MEETING.  HASSAN AL TURABI, 
LEADER OF THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT, WAS PRESENT AT 
OMAR\'S INVITATION.  BECAUSE TURABI IS NOT A MEMBER AND 
THIS GROUP\'S DISCUSSIONS ARE CLOSELY HELD, HIS PRESENCE 
PRODUCED SOME CONCERN AMONG THE REGULAR MEMBERS. 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO MAHGOUB, TURABI WAS INVITED BECAUSE OF 
THE GROWING ROLE OF THE NIF IN SUDANESE SECURITY 
OPERATIONS.  MAHGOUB TOLD POLOFF THAT THE NIF HAS ITS OWN 
SECURITY ARM (THE \"\'AMN AL-THAWRA,\" OR \"SECURITY OF THE 
REVOLUTION\"), SEPARATE FROM THE SUDAN SECURITY BUREAU OF 
THE GOS.  ITS OPERATIVES, WHO CARRY SPECIAL IDENTITY 
CARDS, ARE USUALLY YOUNG AND DRESS IN WESTERN-STYLE 
CLOTHES TO AVOID BEING IDENTIFIED AS NIF CADRE.  MAHGOUB 
SAID THEY ARE ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AT NIGHT, PATROLLING THE 
STREETS IN GROUPS ON FOOT OR IN SMALL CARS TO APPREHEND 
CURFEW VIOLATORS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DRINKING. 
(MAHGOUB DESCRIBED A RUN-IN HE HAD HAD WITH THEM AFTER HE 
HAD HIMSELF BEEN DRINKING.)  ACCORDING TO MAHGOUB, THE 
\"SHABAAT AL BINA\" (YOUTH FOR RECONSTRUCTION), A RECENTLY 
REPORTED INFORMAL SECURITY GROUP, IS AN NIF AUXILIARY 
COMPOSED OF HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. 
 
5.  MAHGOUB SAID TURABI REPROACHED THE COUNCIL FOR 
REFUSING TO STRENGTHEN NIF SECURITY ORGANS AND FOR 
ACCORDING GREATER SUPPORT INSTEAD TO THE SUDAN SECURITY 
BUREAU.  HE ARGUED THAT IT WAS TIME TO GIVE GREATER SCOPE 
TO NIF SECURITY OPERATIONS AND ARGUED FOR A RENEWED DRIVE 
AGAINST DISSIDENTS IN SUDAN--IN PART OUT OF A BELIEF THAT 
WESTERN NATIONS WOULD NOT ALLOW THE BASHIR REGIME TO 
REMAIN IN POWER LONG.  TURABI ALSO SUPPORTED RENEWED 
ACTIVITIES TO DESTABILIZE EGYPT BY SENDING AGITATORS, 
ESPECIALLY STUDENTS, TRAINED IN SUDAN INTO EGYPT TO 
FOMENT UNREST BY CAUSING DISCORD BETWEEN EGYPTIAN MUSLIMS 
AND COPTS. 
 
6.  ACCORDING TO MAHGOUB, OMAR AGREED WITH TURABI\'S PLEA 
ABOUT NIF SECURITY FORCES BUT SAID THAT THE MONEY TO 
REINFORCE NIF SECURITY WAS NOT AVAILABLE.  OMAR POINTED 
OUT THAT THE GOS HAD AGREED TO FUND IMAMS AND MUEZZINS AT 
CONSIDERABLE COST.  (NOTE:  ON SEPT. 19 THE GOS ANNOUNCED 
THAT IMAMS WOULD BE PAID 400 SUDANESE POUNDS PER MONTH 
AND MUEZZINS 350 POUNDS--USDOLS 90 AND 78 RESPECTIVELY AT 
THE OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE OF 4.45 POUNDS TO THE DOLLAR. 
END NOTE.)  OMAR ADDED THAT THE INVASION OF KUWAIT BY 
IRAQ HAD RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF USDOLS 140 MILLION OF 
EXPECTED KUWAITI CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ISLAMIC DAW\'A IN 
SUDAN, FROM WHICH MONEY FOR NIF SECURITY FORCES WAS TO 
HAVE BEEN DRAWN.  ALTHOUGH UNABLE TO PROVIDE GREATER 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE \"SECURITY OF THE REVOLUTION,\" 
THE COUNCIL ACCORDED TURABI SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED 
INFLUENCE OVER SECURITY ACTIVITIES IN SUDAN.  NO CHANGE, 
HOWEVER, WAS MADE IN THE FORMAL SECURITY STRUCTURE; 
TURABI\'S ROLE IS TO BE LARGELY INFORMAL THOUGH NOT 
WITHOUT INFLUENCE. 
 
7.  MAHGOUB SAID THE COUNCIL ALSO DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM 
OF THE SOUTH.  THE MEMBERS AGREED THAT WESTERN RELIEF 
AGENCIES POSE A BARRIER TO VIGOROUS PROSECUTION OF THE 
CIVIL WAR.  THEY AGREED ON A PROGRAM OF HARASSMENT AND 
OBSTRUCTIONISM OF RELIEF EFFORTS INTENDED TO FORCE RELIEF 
AGENCIES TO WITHDRAW FROM THE SOUTH, PREFERABLY BY THE 
END OF DECEMBER 1990.  THIS PROGRAM COULD ESCALATE TO 
AMBUSHES OF RELIEF WORKERS OR DESTRUCTION OF RELIEF 
AIRPLANES, ESPECIALLY IF THESE ACTIONS COULD BE BLAMED ON 
THE SUDAN PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY (SPLA).  WITH THE 
RELIEF AGENCIES GONE, THE SUDANESE MILITARY COULD EMPLOY 
IN THE CIVIL WAR ZONE SOME FIVE TONS OF \"KHARDALAH\" 
(MUSTARD) GAS GIVEN TO SUDAN BY IRAQ.  (SEE COMMENT) 
 
8.  MAHGOUB CONFIRMED THAT NIF LEADERS OFTEN MEET WITH 
GEN. OMAR TO DISCUSS GOS POLICY.  MAHGOUB SAID THEY ALSO 
MEET AS A GROUP TO COORDINATE THEIR VIEWS--OFTEN DURING 
THE CURFEW PERIOD AT NIGHT TO AVOID OBSERVATION.  APART 
FROM TURABI, THEY INCLUDE: 
 
-     MOHAMMED YOUSIF MOHAMMED, AN ATTORNEY AND FORMER 
SPEAKER OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY (CA) NOW ACTIVE IN 
THE ISLAMIC-AFRICAN RELIEF ORGANIZATION; 
 
-     ALI OSMAN MOHAMMED TAHA, NIF DEPUTY GENERAL 
SECRETARY; 
 
-     DR. IBRAHIM AHMED OMER, FORMER NIF DEPUTY IN THE CA 
AND NOW HEAD OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION; 
 
-     DR. NAFI ALI NAFI, FORMER AGRICULTURE PROFESSOR AND 
CURRENTLY A MAJOR FIGURE IN SUDANESE SECURITY; 
 
-     IBRAHIM SENUSSI, A MAJOR FIGURE IN THE NIF\'S MOTHER 
ORGANIZATION, THE MOSLEM BROTHERS; 
 
-     AHMED SULEIMAN, FORMER COLUMNIST FOR THE NIF PARTY 
PAPER \"AL RAYA\" (\"THE PILLAR\") AND NOW COLUMNIST IN TWO 
GOS-CONTROLLED DAILIES; 
 
-     MOHAMMED MOHAMMED SADIQ AL KARORI, PRESIDENT OF THE 
HIGHER ADVISORY COUNCIL OF THE NIF; 
 
-     HAFIZ AS-SHEIKH ZAKI, CURRENTLY DEAN OF THE 
UNIVERSITY OF KHARTOUM SCHOOL OF LAW; 
 
-     AHMAD MAHJOUB HAG NUR, AN INFLUENTIAL LEADER OF THE 
NIF\'S RADICAL WING. 
 
9.  COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH NEVER CONFIRMED, ACCOUNTS OF 
POSSESSION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY THE GOS HAVE BEEN RIFE 
FOR YEARS.  INTELLIGENCE SOURCES DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE 
SAF, IF THEY HAVE CHEMICAL WEAPONS, I.E. MUSTARD GAS, 
NAPALM, ARE CAPABLE OF MIXING THE CHEMICALS, STORING THEM 
WITHOUT HARM TO THEMSELVES OR DELIVERING THEM TO AN 
ENEMY.  GOS OBSTRUCTIONISM ON RELIEF, RECENTLY 
ESCALATING, IS A MATTER OF RECORD.  MAHGOUB\'S COMMENTS 
CONFIRM MANY PREVIOUS REPORTS (MOST NOTABLY IN REF B) 
ABOUT THE DOMINANT ROLE OF THE NIF WITHIN THE GOS, 
INCLUDING THE EXISTENCE OF NIF SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS AND 
GEN. OMAR\'S CLOSE CONNECTIONS WITH THE NIF.  NIF LEADERS, 
INCLUDING TURABI, NOW OPENLY AVOW THE IDENTITY BETWEEN 
THEIR VIEWS AND THOSE OF THE GOS.  MANY OF THE NAMES ON 
MAHGOUB\'S LIST HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN THE PAST AS MEMBERS 
OF THE \"COUNCIL OF FORTY,\" A SHADOWY GROUP WHICH 
ALLEGEDLY HAS DIRECTED THE GOS SINCE THE JUNE 30, 1989 
COUP.  DETAILS ABOUT THE GROUP REMAIN ELUSIVE, BUT MOST 
SUDANESE (INCLUDING OFFICIALS) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 
UNOFFICIAL SOURCES WIELD CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE. 
TURABI\'S ALLEGED SECURITY ROLE INDICATES THAT THE 
\"REORGANIZATION\" OF GOS SECURITY ORGANS SEVERAL MONTHS 
AGO, WHICH STRIPPED THE RELATIVELY MODERATE BRIG. IBRAHIM 
NAIL EIDAM OF HIS SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES, WAS INTENDED 
TO BRING THAT SECTOR AS WELL UNDER GREATER NIF INFLUENCE.

TAGS:  PREL, PINR, SU, LY, EG 
SUBJECT:  QADHAFI VISITS SUDAN; CALLS FOR SUDAN, LIBYAN, 
EGYPTIAN UNITY; CRITICIZES RELIGION IN GOVERNMENT 
 
REF:  KHARTOUM 11006 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  LIBYA\'S QADHAFI VISITED KHARTOUM OCTOBER 
20-23 TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CELEBRATION OF THE OCTOBER 
1964 REVOLUTION.  WHILE HERE, HE ADDRESSED THE CLOSING 
SESSION OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE CONFERENCE ON THE 
POLITICAL SYSTEM (NDCPS).  QADHAFI CALLED FOR ARAB UNITY, 
PARTICULARLY UNION BETWEEN SUDAN, EGYPT, AND LIBYA.  HE 
SAID HE WOULD TRY TO CONVINCE SPLA LEADER JOHN GARANG TO 
END THE REBELLION AGAINST THE GOS.  QADHAFI ALSO MET WITH 
THE SUDANESE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION FOR OVER TWO HOURS AND 
MADE A STRONG PITCH FOR KEEPING RELIGION (READ ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM) OUT OF GOVERNMENT.  MOST SUDANESE ARE 
PLEASED WITH THE SPEECH, BUT MANY BELIEVE IT WAS 
COORDINATED WITH, IF NOT DIRECTED BY MUBARAK.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  THE HIGHLIGHTS OF QADHAFI\'S SPEECH TO THE NDCPS, AS 
REPORTED BY THE SUDAN NEWS AGENCY ARE AS FOLLOWS: 
 
HE RECALLED THAT HE AND EGYPT\'S NASSER ADVOCATED 
SUDAN-EGYPT-LIBYA UNITY IN THE EARLY 1970\'S BUT SUDAN\'S 
NIMEIRI WAS OPPOSED DUE TO \"UNFOUNDED SENSITIVITIES OF 
EGYPT AND SUDAN.\" 
 
HE MENTIONED SEVERAL ARAB TRIBES FOUND IN THE THREE 
COUNTRIES CITING THIS AS AN EVIDENCE OF AN \"INHERENT 
UNITY OF THEIR INHABITANTS.\" 
 
SUDAN, EGYPT, AND LIBYA ARE RICH IN NATURAL AS WELL AS 
HUMAN RESOURCES AND, IF UNIFIED, THEY CAN FORM A POWERFUL 
STATE. 
 
REFERRING TO THE NDCPS RECOMMENDATION THAT PEOPLE\'S 
CONGRESSES FORM THE GOS, QADHAFI SAID THIS IS A TURNING 
POINT IN ARAB HISTORY IN WHICH THE SUDANESE PEOPLE HAVE 
OPTED FOR THE PEOPLE\'S POWER WHICH WAS HERALDED BY LIBYA. 
 
HE CALLED THE PARLIAMENTARY, PARTISAN, AND GOVERNMENT 
SYSTEMS \"NONSENSE\" SAYING THAT THEY HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE 
AND HAVE GIVEN WAY TO HIS \"JAMAHIRYA STYLE\" IN WHICH 
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR GOVERNMENT AND IN WHICH THE PEOPLE 
RUN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS THROUGH THEIR PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES 
AND CONGRESSES.  HE PREDICTED THAT THE JAMAHIRYA SYSTEM 
AND THE PEOPLE\'S POWER WOULD BE PRACTICED ALL OVER THE 
WORLD. 
 
HE HAILED AND EXPRESSED HIS FULL SUPPORT TO RCC CHAIRMAN 
AND HEAD OF STATE, GENERAL OMAR AL BASHIR AND HIS AIDES 
WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS \"THE FIRST SUDANESE LEADERSHIP THAT 
OPTED TO DEVOLVE POWER TO THE PEOPLE BY CHOOSING THE 
POPULAR POWER WHICH IS TO BE EXERCISED BY THE PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEES AND CONGRESSES.\" 
 
QADHAFI SAID THAT SPLA LEADER JOHN GARANG WAS A MEMBER OF 
THE LIBYAN-BASED INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION 
WHICH ADVOCATED PEOPLE\'S POWER TO PREVAIL IN THE WORLD, 
AND HE PLEDGED TO TRY TO CONVINCE GARANG TO TERMINATE HIS 
REBELLION NOW THAT A JAMAHIRYA SYSTEM WOULD BE 
ESTABLISHED IN SUDAN. 
 
HE SAID THAT LIBYA HAD ARMED AND TRAINED GARANG WHEN HE 
WAS FIGHTING PRESIDENT NIMEIRI BUT NOW HAD STOPPED 
SUPPLYING GARANG WITH ARMS.  HE ADDED THAT IF GARANG 
WOULD NOT JOIN \"THE MASSES OF THE SUDAN\" LIBYA WOULD HAVE 
NO CHOICE BUT TO TURN AGAINST GARANG IN SUPPORT OF THE 
SUDANESE PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT. 
 
APPARENTLY IN A LIGHT REBUKE TO EGYPT FOR ITS 
INDIFFERENCE TOWARD THE SOUTHERN SUDAN PROBLEM, QADHAFI 
SAID EGYPT SHOULD APPRECIATE THAT DEFENSE OF SOUTHERN 
SUDAN WOULD PROTECT EGYPT AND THAT SECESSION OF SOUTH 
SUDAN IS HAZARDOUS TO EGYPT. 
 
HE PREDICTED THAT THE SOUTHERN SUDAN PROBLEM WOULD WITHER 
AWAY IF UNITY OF SUDAN, EGYPT AND LIBYA WAS ACHIEVED. 
 
HE DECLARED THAT DEMONSTRATIONS WOULD BE STAGED IN ALL 
ARAB COUNTRIES AS OF THE FIRST DAY OF NEXT JANUARY 
PEACEFULLY DEMANDING ABOLITION OF BORDERLINES SEPARATING 
THE ARAB COUNTRIES FROM ONE ANOTHER. 
 
3.  QADHAFI\'S EVENING SPEECH TO THE STUDENTS WAS ALSO 
ATTENDED BY GENERAL OMAR.  CHARACTERIZED AS \"BLUNT,\" IT 
CALLED FOR A SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.  QADHAFI 
EMPHASIZED THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR RELIGION IN 
GOVERNMENT, DEFENSE, ADMINISTRATION, OR EVEN JUSTICE, A 
DIRECT CHALLENGE TO SHARIA. 
 
4.  COMMENT:  DESPITE THE SHOW OF SOLIDARITY AND THE 
RHETORIC, SERIOUS OBSTACLES REMAIN TO FULLY DEVELOPING 
GOS-GOL TIES.  GIVEN THE PRIMARILY ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST 
BENT OF QADHAFI\'S EVENING AUDIENCE, HE SENT A CLEAR 
NEGATIVE SIGNAL TO OMAR AND THE NIF.  RELATIONS BETWEEN 
LIBYA AND SUDAN\'S FUNDAMENTALISTS HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSE. 
THE RECENT ARREST OF 200 \"ISLAMISTS\" IN LIBYA WAS NOTICED 
BY SENIOR NIF MEMBER WHO COMMENTED ON QADHAFI\'S ANTIPATHY 
TOWARD ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM.  THE GOL-GOS UNITY 
DECLARATION AND THE FEW ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT STEPS TO 
IMPLEMENT IT HAVE NOT HELPED THE RELATIONSHIP. 
 
5.  MOST SUDANESE WERE PLEASED WITH QADHAFI\'S SPEECH, 
SINCE THEY SEE IT AS A DIRECT ATTACK ON THE NIF.  THEY 
ALL NOTE THAT \"NO SUDANESE COULD HAVE SAID WHAT QADHAFI 
SAID.\"  MANY BELIEVE THAT EGYPT\'S MUBARAK WAS BEHIND THE 
SPEECH; IF NOT, HE ALMOST CERTAINLY WAS CONSULTED.  IN 
ANY EVENT, THE MESSAGE IS THE SAME THAT MUBARAK 
REPORTEDLY GAVE OMAR A YEAR AGO DURING HIS VISIT TO 
KHARTOUM.  DIPLOMATIC SOURCES HAVE TOLD US THAT AS BLUNT 
AS THE SPEECH WAS, QADHAFI WAS EVEN MORE BLUNT IN PRIVATE 
DISCUSSIONS OVER NIF INFLUENCE, SHARIA AND SUDAN\'S 
INABILITY TO FEED ITSELF IN SUCH A RICH COUNTRY.  HE ALSO 
REPORTEDLY CRITICIZED THE PROLIFERATION OF GENERALS IN 
THE SPAF, NOTING THERE WERE \"TOO MANY STARS ON THEIR 
SHOULDERS.\"  . 
 
6.  QADHAFI\'S OFFER TO INTERCEDE WITH GARANG IS PROBABLY 
MORE SHOW THAN SUBSTANCE.  QADHAFI STILL MAINTAINS CLOSE 
TIES TO FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER MUBARAK AL FADIL AL 
MAHDI, COUSIN OF THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER SADIQ AL MAHDI 
AND SENIOR UMMA PARTY OFFICIAL, WHO SIGNED AN AGREEMENT 
WITH GARANG EARLIER THIS YEAR.  QADHAFI THUS HAS A 
COMMUNICATION CHANNEL IF HE WISHES TO USE IT.  AS FOR 
QADHAFI\'S THREAT TO TURN AGAINST GARANG, HE IS ALREADY 
FURNISHING SIGNIFICANT MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THE GOS. 
 
7.  QADHAFI\'S PERFORMANCE MAY WELL FEED DOUBTS AMONG THE 
GOS LEADERSHIP ABOUT HIS RELIABILITY AS AN ALLY AND 
FURTHER STIMULATE THEIR COURTSHIP OF IRAN, WHICH THEY ARE 
SCHEDULED TO VISIT IN EARLY NOVEMBER.

REF:  A) STATE 355397, B) KHARTOUM 7788, C) KHARTOUM 11253 
 
1.  THE 1990 TERRORISM REPORT FOR SUDAN IS AS FOLLOWS. 
 
2.  THE ACROPOLE TERRORIST BOMBING CASE WENT THROUGH A 
SERIES OF POSTPONEMENTS, WITH THE NEXT HEARING NOW 
SCHEDULED FOR JAN. 22, 1991 (REF C).  MANY OF THE 
POSTPONEMENTS, INCLUDING THE MOST RECENT ONE, INVOLVED 
CONSULATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE VICTIMS\' 
FAMILIES.  THE FAMILIES SUBMITTED STATEMENTS DURING THE 
YEAR INDICATING WHETHER THEY WOULD PARDON THE TERRORISTS, 
WITH OR WITHOUT COMPENSATION (\"DIYYA\"), AS WELL AS THE 
AMOUNT OF DIYYA DEMANDED.  THE COURT ANNOUNCED IN 1989 
THAT IF ANY FAMILY REFUSED TO PARDON THE TERRORISTS, THEY 
WOULD BE EXECUTED.  SOME COMMENTS BY LEGAL AUTHORITIES IN 
1990 SUGGESTED THAT LONG-TERM IMPRISONMENT OF THE 
TERRORISTS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT 
INCLUDED IN THE CHOICES MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FAMILIES. 
 
3.  THE GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM 
EFFORTS IN 1990. 
 
4.  THE PLO CAMP NEAR SUDAN\'S RED SEA COAST, OCCUPIED 
SINCE THE EVACUATION OF BEIRUT IN 1982, WAS REPORTEDLY 
EVACUATED IN 1990 (REF B).  NO OTHER TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE CAMPS IN SUDAN. 
SUDAN EXTENDS DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION TO THE PLO, WHICH 
MAINTAINS AN EMBASSY IN KHARTOUM.  PLO CHIEF YASSER 
ARAFAT VISITED SUDAN SEVERAL TIMES IN 1990. 
 
5.  THE GOVERNMENT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 1990 IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING GOVERNMENT ON A 
TERRORISM ISSUE. 
 
6.  ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT A SPONSOR OF TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS, IT HAS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAQ AND 
INCREASING CONNECTIONS WITH IRAN.  IN 1990 THE GOVERNMENT 
SIGNED AN \"INTEGRATION AGREEMENT\" WITH LIBYA.  AS A 
RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT, COL. MUAMMAR QADHAFI VISITED 
KHARTOUM IN OCTOBER.  THIS AGREEMENT PERMITS MUCH EASIER 
ACCESS TO SUDAN BY LIBYANS.  SUDANESE AND NORTH KOREAN 
OFFICIALS EXCHANGED VISITS DURING THE YEAR.  THE OUTBREAK 
OF THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS IN AUGUST PRODUCED MORE 
INTENSIVE PAN-ARAB AND PAM ISLAMIC COMMENTARY IN THE 
GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA, CREATING A MORE RECEPTIVE 
CLIMATE FOR ANTI-WESTERN ACTIONS IN SUDAN.

2.  SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR PRESENTED REF A DEMARCHE TO 
FOREIGN MINISTER SAHLOUL MORNING NOVEMBER 26.  FOREIGN 
MINISTER GRAVELY ACKNOWLEDGED SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR 
GOS AVOWED POSITION OF NEUTRALITY IN GULF CONFLICT AND 
ITS RELATIONS WITH USG AND OTHER COUNTRIES OF ANY 
SHARING WITH IRAQ OF INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION OBTAINED 
FROM THE SAUDI FIGHTER PILOT DEFECTOR.  HE AGREED 
PROMPTLY TO CONVEY OUR DEMARCHE TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS 
OF THE GOS.  END SUMMARY 
 
3.  AMBASSADOR ACCOMPANIED BY ECON COUNSELLOR CALLED ON 
FOREIGN MINISTER ALI SAHLOUL MORNING NOVEMBER 26 TO 
PRESENT DEMARCHE AS INSTRUCTED REF A.  ALSO PRESENT ON 
GOS SIDE WERE DIRECTOR TWO AMERICAS DEPARTMENT, AMB. 
OMAR ABDEL MAGID, AND HIS DEPUTY KAMAL AHMED FADUL 
(NOTETAKER). 
 
4.  AMBASSADOR BEGAN BY RECALLING HIS AUGUST 28 MEETING 
WITH PRESIDENT AL BASHIR DURING WHICH HE HAD WARNED THE 
PRESIDENT AGAINST ANY GOS ACTIVE SUPPORT FOR IRAQ AND 
VIOLATIONS OF UNSC RESOLUTIONS ON THE GULF CONFLICT. 
HE NOTED THAT PRESIDENT HAD ASSURED HIM AT THAT TIME 
THAT GOS HAD NOT AND WOULD NOT ACTIVELY SUPPORT IRAQ 
AND THAT IT WOULD RESPECT UNSC RESOLUTIONS ON THE 
GULF.  SINCE THEN THERE HAD BEEN SOME INDICATIONS OF 
POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS ON UNSC RESOLUTIONS RELATED TO 
ASSISTANCE TO IRAQUI SHIPS IN PORT SUDAN WHICH WE HAD 
BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE GOS.  GIVEN THIS 
BACKGROUND WE WERE NOW SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT IRAQ COULD GATHER INTELLIGENCE FROM 
THE SAUDI FIGHTER  PILOT WHO DEFECTED TO SUDAN RECENTLY 
AND REMAINED IN GOS CUSTODY.  THIS CONCERN HAD 
INCREASED IN RECENT DAYS AS A RESULT OF INDICATIONS 
THAT THE GOS MIGHT ALLOW THE IRAQUIS TO EXPLOIT THE 
SAUDI PILOT FOR INTELLIGENCE PURPOSES. 
 
5.  THE AMBASSADOR THEN SLOWLY READ TO THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER THE FULL TEXT OF THE TALKING  POINTS IN PARA 2 
OF REF A AND GAVE HIM A NON-PAPER WHICH CONTAINED 
THEM.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER GRAVELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
THIS WAS A MOST SERIOUS MATTER WHICH HE APPRECIATED THE 
AMBASSADOR PROMPTLY BRINGING TO HIS ATTENTION.  HE 
AGREED WITH THE POINT THAT SUCH ACTION BY THE GOS WOULD 
DESTROY ITS CLAIM TO NEUTRALITY BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES 
IN THE GULF CONFLICT AND UNDERMINE ITS EFFORTS TO BRING 
ABOUT A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION WITHIN THE ARAB FAMILY.  HE 
ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THE GRAVE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH ACTION 
FOR GOS RELATIONS WITH THE USG AND OTHER ALLIED 
GOVERNMENTS.  HE SAID THAT HE WOULD CONVEY OUR DEMARCHE 
TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE GOS.  AMBASSDOR URGED HIM 
TO DO SO QUICKLY GIVEN THE GRAVITY OF THE ISSUE AND THE 
POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR SUDAN.  AS AMBASSADOR OMAR 
ABDEL MAGID ESCORTED AMBASSADOR TO HIS CAR HE CONFIDED 
THAT THIS WAS THE MOST SERIOUS MEETING HE HAD ATTENDED 
DURING HIS TENURE IN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  AMBASSADOR 
AGREED THAT IT WAS INDEED SERIOUS. 
 
6. COMMENT: I DOUBT THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTER IS IN THE 
LOOP ON GOS HANDLING OF THE DEFECTED SAUDI FIGHTER 
PILOT.  HE NOW IS AND I BELIEVE HE WILL DO AS HE SAID 
AND CONVEY OUR DEMARCHE TO THE PRESIDENT.  IT MAY WELL 
BE TOO LATE TO DETER THE GOS (REF B).  NEVERTHELESS, AS 
I NOTED REF C, WE HAVE AT LEAST PUT THE GOS ON NOTICE 
AND LAID DOWN A MARKER SHOULD A MORE SEVERE RESPONSE BE 
REQUIRED LATER. 
 
7.  POSTSCRIPT:  AFTER DRAFTING ABOVE, AMBASSADOR OMAR 
MAGID TELEPHONED TO INFORM ME THAT FOREIGN MINISTER 
SAHLOUL HAD SPOKEN TO THE PRESIDENT ABOUT OUR DEMARCHE 
THIS MORNING AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER WISHED TO SEE ME 
TOMORROW (NOVEMBER 27) AT 0845.

      C) KHARTOUM 11159 
 
 
1.  ACCORDING TO SUDAN\'S ENGLISH LANGUAGE WEEKLY \"NEW 
HORIZON,\" SUDAN\'S HEAD OF STATE, GENERAL OMAR AL BASHIR, 
HAS PUBLICLY ENDORSED THE 1983 SEPTEMBER LAWS.  PROVIDING 
FOR CORPORAL PUNISHMENT KNOWN AS \"HUDUD,\" THE SEPTEMBER 
LAWS ARE ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF 
SUDANESE SOCIETY AND JURISPRUDENCE.  ALTHOUGH PRECEDING 
THE SEPTEMBER LAWS, JOHN GARANG\'S REBELLION IN MARCH 1983 
CAME IN PART AS A RESULT OF THEN PRESIDENT NIMEIRI\'S 
TREND TOWARD ISLAMICIZATION.  HUDUD PUNISHMENTS, ALTHOUGH 
HANDED DOWN, HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED SINCE NIMEIRI\'S 
OVERTHROW IN 1985, AND THE ROLE OF SHARIA REMAINS A MAJOR 
SYMBOL IN THE CONTINUING CIVIL WAR. 
 
2.  COMMENT:  BASHIR\'S ENDORSEMENT OF THE SEPTEMBER LAWS 
COULD LEAD TO IMPLEMENTATION OF HUDUD PUNISHMENTS.  IT 
WILL CERTAINLY LEAD TO A FURTHER ESTRANGEMENT FROM THE 
SOUTH (IF THAT IS POSSIBLE).  IN ADDITION, BASHIR\'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT COULD LEAD TO DIFFICULTIES IN SUDAN\'S UNITY 
PLANS WITH LIBYA.  DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO KHARTOUM 
QADHAFI WAS VERY CRITICAL OF SHARIA AND ALLEGEDLY 
INTIMIDATED BASHIR INTO NOT ENDORSING SHARIA AT THAT TIME 
(REFTELS).

SUBJECT:  BASHIR AND THE RCC ON THE EVE OF THEIR SECOND 
          ANNIVERSARY 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  BESEIGED AND CRITICIZED FROM VIRTUALLY 
EVERY QUARTER, AS IT APPROACHES ITS SECOND ANNIVERSARY, 
GENERAL OMAR AL-BASHIR\'S REVOLUTION COMMAND COUNCIL 
NONETHELESS APPEARS FIRMLY IN CHARGE OF SUDAN.  THE 
RECENT CURRENCY CHANGE, ABOUT AS BADLY BOTCHED AS 
ANYTHING THE GOS HAS DONE, REVEALED A POPULATION 
TOTALLY COWED.  THE OPPOSITION REMAINS FRAGMENTED AND 
UNORGANIZED AND MOST POTENTIAL LEADERSHIP IS OUTSIDE 
TRY.  CONFLICT CONTINUES WITHIN THE RCC WITH 
SOME MEMBERS MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN OTHERS, BUT BASHIR 
HIMSELF IS PROBABLY STILL FIRST AMONG EQUALS.  THE 
NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT EFFECTIVELY CONTROLS INTERNAL 
SECURITY, THE ECONOMY, AND THE MEDIA, HENCE 
CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL POWER, BUT NIF HEAD HASSAN AL 
TURABI AND BASHIR SHARE A COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS 
GIVING THE IMPRESSION OF PERVASIVE NIF INFLUENCE WHICH 
MAY NOT BE AS ABSOLUTE AS IT APPEARS.  UNLESS AND UNTIL 
THOSE INTERESTS DIVERGE IT WILL REMAIN DIFFICULT TO 
ASCERTAIN WHO WIELDS GREATER POWER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  DESPITE INCREASING CRITICISM FROM EVERY QUARTER 
EXCEPT THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT, GENERAL OMAR AL 
BASHIR\'S GOVERNMENT APPEARS STRONGER THEN EVER.  IN THE 
WAKE OF THE GULF WAR AND WITH A TOTALLY BANKRUPT 
ECONOMY, THE RCC SHOULD BE ON THE DEFENSIVE, BUT IT IS 
NOT.  ANY DOUBTS ABOUT THE REGIME\'S RESILIENCE, HAVE 
BEEN DISPELLED BY THE RECENT CURRENCY CHANGE.  ALTHOUGH 
BADLY EXECUTED, THE GOS ACCOMPLISHED, AT LEAST FOR THE 
MOMENT, ITS STATED GOALS OF REDUCING LIQUIDITY, GAINING 
SOME CONTROL OVER THE MONEY SUPPLY, AND REDUCING 
INFLATION.  UNSTATED BUT OBVIOUS GOALS SUCH AS 
UNDERMINING THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE MAJOR 
OPPOSITION PARTIES AND THE SPLA WERE ALSO SERVED. 
 
4.  AT THE SAME TIME, DUE TO A SERIES OF ERRORS AND 
MISCALCULATIONS, THE CURRENCY CHANGE BROUGHT THE 
ECONOMY TO A SCREECHING HALT AND ADVERSELY IMPACTED 
VIRTUALLY EVERY SUDANESE.  HOWEVER, AGAIN SHOWING THEIR 
TENDENCY TO SHRINK TO ANY OCCASION, THE SUDANESE LINED 
UP DAY AFTER DAY AT BANKS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO TURN IN 
THEIR CASH FOR PARTIAL PAYMENT AND PROMISES.  QUEUES 
WERE GENERALLY DISCIPLINED AND WITHOUT INCIDENT; IN 
SEVERAL CASES SOLDIERS ACTUALLY MARCHED THE CIVILIAN 
POPULATION IN MILITARY LIKE FORMATION TO THE BANKS. 
 
5.  OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT, WHILE WIDESPREAD AND 
INCREASINGLY VOCAL, REMAINS FRAGMENTED AND TOTALLY 
UNORGANIZED.  ALMOST ALL POTENTIAL LEADERSHIP IS 
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.  THE FEW FORMER POLITICAL PARTY 
LEADERS STILL IN KHARTOUM ARE SO DISCREDITED THEY POSE 
LITTLE THREAT TO THE GOVERNMENT.  TRADITIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS OF REGIME MAINTENANCE SUCH AS THE 
MILITARY, POLICE, AND BUREAUCRACY ARE UNDOUBTEDLY 
DISENCHANTED WITH THE GOVERNMENT, BUT THEY ARE SO 
THOROUGHLY INFILTRATED WITH LOYAL SECURITY PERSONNEL 
AND NIF INFORMANTS THAT THERE IS LITTLE POSSIBILITY 
THEY COULD MOUNT ANY EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION. 
 
6.  ONLY THE NIF SUPPORTS THE REGIME AND THEY HAVE 
PROFITED HANDSOMELY FROM THEIR COLLUSION.  AS NIF 
OFFICIALS ARE QUICK TO POINT OUT, THEY WERE THE ONLY 
PARTY IN OPPOSITION WHEN BASHIR TOOK OVER IN JUNE 
1989.  CONSEQUENTLY THEY WERE THE LOGICAL CHOICE TO 
ASSIST THE NEW GOVERNMENT.  (FYI:  SEVERAL SUDANESE 
STILL CLAIM, WITHOUT EVIDENT PROOF, THAT THE COUP WAS 
ENGINEERED BY THE NIF TO THWART SADIQ AL MAHDI\'S PEACE 
EFFORTS.  END FYI.) NIF MEMBERS OR SYMPATHIZERS NOW 
OCCUPY KEY POSITIONS IN THE BUREAUCRACY, MEDIA, LABOR, 
ACADEMIA, JUDICIARY, MILITARY, AND SECURITY 
ORGANIZATIONS.  BASHIR\'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED ALMOST 
EVERY MAJOR NIP POLICY FROM FEDERALISM, AND 
ISLAMICIZATION OF EDUCATION TO THE RECENT ADOPTION OF 
OF A NEW PENAL CODE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM TURABI\'S 1988 
PROPOSAL AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA.  LONG A POWERFUL 
FORCE IN BANKING AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THEY NOW 
CONTROL WHATEVER PROFITABLE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TAKES 
PLACE IN SUDAN.  NIF MEMBERS WERE VIRTUALLY UNAFFECTED 
BY THE CURRENCY CHANGE; HAVING BEEN FOREWARNED, THEY 
TURNED THEIR CASH INTO GOLD, COMMODITIES, OR HARD 
CURRENCY PRIOR TO THE CHANGE.  THE NIP, HOWEVER, IS NOT 
A MONOLITH AND SOME MEMBERS EXERCISE GREATER INFLUENCE 
THAN OTHERS. 
 
7.  ONLY LIBYA JARS THE RCC-NIP EQUILIBRIUM.  QADHAFI 
HAS CRITICIZED BASHIR FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARIA 
AND THE MIXING OF RELIGION AND POLITCS, TWO KEY NIF 
POLICIES.  LIBYA HAS ALSO MOVED DECISIVELY AGAINST 
FUNDAMENTALISTS AT HOME, AND LIBYAN RECONCILIATION WITH 
EGYPT, OFTEN CITED B/ NIF MEMBERS AS THEIR ARCHENEMY, 
MITIGATE AGAINST NIP INFLUENCE.  MOST BELIEVE ONLY 
LIBYAN INFLUENCE KEEPS BASHIR FROM DECLARING SUDAN AN 
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC.  THE NIF SEEMS TO BE BANKING ON 
SUDAN\'S EMERGING RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN TO COUNTER 
LIBYAN INFLUENCE, WHICH IS BASED PRIMARILY ON GOS 
DEPENDENCE FOR BOTH OIL AND ARMS.  ALTHOUGH THE 
IRANIANS ARE ASSERTING THEMSELVES IN CULTURAL, 
EDUCATIONAL, AND RELIGIOUS AREAS (ALL EXCLUSIVELY NIF 
SPHERES), THEY HAVE YET TO COMPETE WITH THE LIBYANS IN 
SUPPLYING OIL OR ARMS. 
 
8.  COMMENT:  CONFLICT CONTINUES WITHIN THE RCC BETWEEN 
THOSE MEMBERS WHO STRONGLY FAVOR NIP POLICIES AND THOSE 
WHO PREFER A MORE SECULAR STATE.  TWO RCC MEMBERS WERE 
RECENTLY DISMISSED (OR RESIGNED DEPENDING ON WHOM YOU 
CONSULT) FOR THEIR DISSENTING OPINIONS.  THE THREE 
SOUTHERNERS AND OTHER MODERATES APPEAR TO HAVE LITTLE 
IF ANY INFLUENCE, LEADING MOST OBSERVERS TO CONCLUDE 
THAT TURABI AND THE NIF, OPERATING IN A POLITICAL 
VACUUM, CONTROL THE GOVERNMENT COMPLETELY.  NIF 
INFLUENCE IS CERTAINLY GREAT, BUT BASHIR SEEMS STILL IN 
CONTROL.  BECAUSE HE IS A PROPONENT OF NIF POLICIES, IT 
IS UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT HE IS HIS OWN MAN, AS TINY 
ROWLAND SUGGESTS.  UNTIL HE AND TURABI COME INTO 
CONFLICT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH 
POWER TURABI ACTUALLY WIELDS.  HOWEVER, AS LONG AS 
BASHIR AND TURABI AGREE ON THE AGENDA FOR THE GOS, 
CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM OVER A MAJOR SUBSTANTIVE, POLICY 
ISSUE IS UNLIKELY.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, LY, SU 
SUBJECT:  BASHIR\'S SECOND ANNIVERSARY SPEECH:  HOT 
          AIR IN THE DESERT 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  THE HIGHLIGHT OF CELEBRATIONS 
(VASTLY SCALED DOWN) FOR THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE NATIONAL SALVATION REVOLUTION WAS RCC CHAIRMAN 
BASHIR\'S SPEECH JUNE 29 AT FRIENDSHIP HALL.  IN 
ATTENDANCE WERE LIBYAN LEADER QHADDAFI AND CHADIAN 
PRESIDENT IDRIS DEBY (THE ONLY HEADS OF STATE PRESENT 
THIS YEAR) AS WELL AS SOME LOWER-LEVEL YEMENI, SOMALI 
AND ERITREAN DELEGATIONS.  BASHIR\'S SPEECH WAS 
LARGELY SELF-CONGRATULATORY AND PEPPERED WITH THE 
EXPECTED DIGS AT THE FORMER POLITICAL PARTIES, THE 
OPPOSITION IN EXILE AND THE SOUTHERN REBELS.  ONE 
UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT WAS THE GOS\' INTENT TO 
DEMOLISH KHOBAR PRISON IN A SYMBOLIC GESTURE OF 
SUDAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (LOU)  SUBSTITUTING FOR THE LARGE 
MILITARY/CIVILIAN PARADE STAGED LAST YEAR WAS A 
\"GLORIOUS CELEBRATION\" HELD IN THE COURTYARD OF 
FRIENDSHIP HALL, AT WHICH PRESIDENT BASHIR DELIVERED 
HIS SPEECH ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NATIONAL 
SALVATION REVOLUTION.  ALL CHIEFS OF MISSION, INVITED 
FOR 1830 HOURS, WERE SEATED IN A LONG ROW OF CHAIRS 
IN FRONT OF A PACKED MASS OF STANDING \"POPULAR 
FORCES\" WHO APPEARED TO BE ALMOST ENTIRELY NIF 
MEMBERS AND POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES (PDF) IN UNIFORM. 
ASSEMBLED THERE ALMOST TWO HOURS EARLIER, THEY WERE 
PRESSED TIGHTLY AGAINST THE SEATED DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
AND SWEATING PROFUSELY.  SINCE THE DEMONSTRATION WAS 
LIMITED TO THE FENCED-IN FRONT COURTYARD OF THE HALL, 
THE CROWD NUMBERED ONLY ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND, WITH 
POSSIBLY TWO THOUSAND MORE LINGERING OUTSIDE THE 
FENCE.  DESPITE REPEATED EFFORTS TO AROUSE THE CROWD 
WITH SLOGANS SHOUTED OVER LARGE LOUDSPEAKERS, IT 
REMAINED LISTLESS AND UNRESPONSIVE. 
 
3.  (U)  AT ABOUT 2000 HOURS, GOS MILITARY AND 
CIVILIAN OFFICIALS AND SCORES OF SPECIAL GUESTS 
EMERGED FROM THE AIR-CONDITIONED FRIENDSHIP HALL 
WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SOCIALIZING AND ENJOYING 
REFRESHMENTS, WHILE CHIEFS OF MISSION SWELTERED 
OUTSIDE FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.  A LARGE CONTINGENT 
OF HEAVILY-ARMED LIBYAN BODYGUARDS ALSO APPEARED AND 
SEALED OFF THE STEPS LEADING UP TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE 
WHERE THE INVITED WERE SEATED. 
 
DOMESTIC HIGHLIGHTS 
 
4.  (U)  IN HIS SPEECH, BASHIR MADE ALL THE EXPECTED 
NOISES ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE JUNE 30 REVOLUTION 
(EVEN ONE NIF INSIDER SNIFFED TO POLOFF THAT THE 
SO-CALLED REVOLUTION SHOULD BE MORE APTLY DESIGNATED 
THE \"COUP D\'ETAT\").  BASHIR HAILED ADVANCES MADE BY 
THE GOS IN HEALTH, AGRICULTURE, ECONOMIC LAWS AND 
PUBLIC EDUCATION.  HE ALSO PRAISED THE GOS\' EFFORTS 
TO INTRODUCE SHARIA\', TO APPLY THE FEDERAL SYSTEM, 
AND TO MOUNT NATIONAL DIALOGUE CONFERENCES TO \"BOOST 
SHURA\" (I.E. CONSULTATION). 
 
5.  (U)  THESE AND OTHER CHANGES, BASHIR SAID, HAVE 
FREED SUDAN \"FROM THE CAPTIVITY OF POWER-SEEKING 
TRADITIONAL FORCES AND DEFIED THE EXTERNAL CIRCLES 
HARBORING AMBITIONS IN SUDAN.\"  BASHIR CLAIMED THAT 
THE \"FOREIGN-BACKED OPPOSITION\" HAD \"DISINTEGRATED\" 
AND THE REBELLION MOVEMENT HAD \"SHRUNK.\"  THEREFORE, 
IT WAS NOT NECESSSARY FOR THE GOS TO RESORT TO 
EMERGENCY MEASURES.  HE CALLED ON OTHER NATIONS TO 
FOLLOW SUDAN\'S EXAMPLE IN RELEASING POLITICAL 
PRISONERS, A DECISION MADE, HE SAID, IN RESPONSE TO 
APPEALS BY \"ARAB AND MOSLEM BROTHERS AND IN 
COMPLIANCE WITH...ISLAMIC SHARIA.\"  BASHIR RENEWED 
THE GOS AMNESTY FOR ALL WHO \"OPPOSED OR CARRIED ARMS 
AGAINST\" THE COUNTRY BUT GAVE NO APPLICABLE DATES. 
NOT SATISFIED WITH THE EARLIER RELEASE OF POLITICAL 
PRISONERS, BASHIR ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT 1300 CONVICTS 
WOULD BE FREED FROM PRISON.  THESE CONVICTS ARE TO BE 
LARGELY MADE UP OF ELDERLY PERSONS AND YOUTHS WHO 
HAVE SERVED MOST OF THEIR SENTENCE (INELIGIBLE, AMONG 
OTHERS, ARE THOSE IMPRISONED UNDER THE STATE SECURITY 
ACT). 
 
6.  (U)  BASHIR ACKNOWLEDGED THE HARDSHIPS BEING 
ENDURED BY THE SUDANESE POPULATION BUT NOTED THAT 
THEY WERE THE NECESSARY RESULT OF NEEDED ECONOMIC 
REFORMS.  HE ALSO REITERATED THAT THE \"BASES\" OF THE 
NEW POLITICAL SYSTEM WOULD BE LAID DOWN SOON BUT GAVE 
NO OTHER DETAILS. 
 
INTERNATIONAL ARENA 
 
7.  (U)  ON FOREIGN POLICY, BASHIR SAID SUDAN \"WAS 
ABLE TO AFFECT THE OCCURENCE OF EVENTS AND TO MAKE 
THE WORLD CONSIDER ITS VIEWPOINTS\" IN INTERNATIONAL 
FORA.  HE NOTED THAT SUDAN HAD \"STOOD AGAINST THE 
IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT AND ALSO AGAINST THE 
DEVASTATION OF IRAQ.\"  HE DEMANDED THAT THE ARAB 
LEAGUE WORK TOWARDS LIFTING SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAQ. 
BASHIR DESCRIBED THE SUDANESE-LIBYAN INTEGRATION AS 
SUDAN\'S \"OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT\" IN ITS RELATIONS 
WITH THE ARAB WORLD.  THE INTEGRATION, HE CLAIMED, 
HAD \"PRODUCED VARIOUS SUCCESSES\" FOR THE SUDANESE AND 
LIBYAN PEOPLES. 
 
8.  (U)  BASHIR ALSO SAID SUDAN WANTED TO ENHANCE ITS 
RELATIONS WITH ALL WESTERN, EUROPEAN AND EASTERN 
COUNTRIES.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE CALLED ON AFRICAN 
STATES TO INCREASE COOPERATION AMONGST THEMSELVES, IN 
PART TO AVERT FOREIGN INFLUENCE AND DETER COLONIALIST 
INTERVENTIONS.  HE AGAIN URGED THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO ETHIOPIAN REFUGEES IN 
SUDAN. 
 
KHOBAR 
 
9.  BASHIR\'S MOST SURPRISING STATEMENT, HOWEVER, WAS 
HIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE GOS\' INTENT TO DESTROY KHOBER 
PRISON IN KHARTOUM NORTH.  THE DESTRUCTION, TO OCCUR 
JULY 1, IS INTENDED TO SHOW SUDAN\'S COMMITMENT TO 
HUMAN RIGHTS.  (COMMENT:  BASHIR\'S SELECTION OF THIS 
PRISON IS A STRANGE ONE.  OF ALL OF SUDAN\'S JAILS, 
KHOBER IS CONSIDERED THE MOST COMFORTABLE.  MANY 
FORMER KHOBAR DETAINEES HAVE FAVORABLY CONTRASTED 
THEIR ACCOMODATIONS IN KHOBAR TO THE CONDITIONS IN 
OTHER PRISONS -- SHALLA FOR EXAMPLE -- OR IN \"GHOST 
HOUSES.\"  TALK IN KHARTOUM IS THAT THE GOS WANTS THE 
DESIRABLE REAL ESTATE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 
DEVELOPMENT INTO PRICEY HOMES FOR THE ELITE.  END 
COMMENT.) 
 
THE LIBYANS 
 
10.  (LOU)  THE LIBYANS IN ATTENDANCE INCLUDED SOME 
OF QHADDAFI\'S FEMALE BODYGUARDS DRESSED IN TIGHT 
FIGHTING DESIGNER JEANS AND SPIKED HEELS AND PACKING 
PISTOLS UNDER THEIR LOOSE FITTING JUMPER TOPS.  THIS 
MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT SHOCKING TO THE ASSEMBLED 
ALL-MALE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS WHO HEAVILY ROBE AND 
COVER UP FEMALE MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES. 
 
11.  (LOU)  THE APPEARANCE OF POSTERS PICTURING 
COLONEL QHADDAFI  AND CHANTS OF \"WAFI WAFI YA 
QADDHAFI (FAITHFUL QADDHAFI) MADE IT APPARENT THAT 
THE BROTHER LEADERS WOULD NOT ONLY APPEAR BUT WOULD 
BE HONORED AND ADULATED AT THE CEREMONY AND WOULD 
LIKELY ADDRESS THE CROWD, DISPENSING HIS USUAL 
INVECTIVE AGAINST THE U.S. AND THE WEST.  AMBASSADOR 
CHEEK AND BRITISH AMBASSADOR RAMSAY THEREFORE 
DEPARTED FROM THE PREMISES FOLLOWING THE APPEARANCE 
OF QHADDAFI AND THE PLAYING OF SUDAN\'S NATIONAL 
ANTHEM.

TAGS: PREL, PINR, PHUM, PREF, ET, SU 
SUBJECT:  CONVERSATION WITH FORMER PM SADIQ AL MAHDI 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON FORMER PRIME 
MINISTER SADIQ AL MAHDI JUNE 26.  SADIQ DESCRIBED THE 
CURRENT GOVERNMENT AS HAVING THE WORST 
CHARACTERISTICS OF DICTATORSHIP AND A COALITION 
GOVERNMENT.  THE GOS, HE SAID, IS FAILING DISMALLY 
ECONOMICALLY AND CAUSING THE PEOPLE GREAT SUFFERING. 
THE SEPTEMBER LAWS, HE DECLARED, MUST GO.  PEACE AND 
A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT CAN STOP THE SUDAN FROM BEING 
A \"MAVERICK\" COUNTRY.  (COMMENT:  FOR THE FUTURE, IT 
APPEARS THAT SADIQ WILL WAIT ON THE SIDELINES AS THE 
AL BASHIR GOVERNMENT CONTINUES ITS DOWNWARD ECONOMIC 
PLUNGE.  HE WILL THEN BE AVAILABLE TO PICK UP THE 
PIECES. END COMMENT) 
 
3.  AT THE INVITATION OF SADIQ AL MAHDI AMBASSADOR 
CALLED ON HIM JUNE 26.  THE ATMOSPHERE WAS 
COMFORTABLE AND THE CONVERSATION RELAXED.  DCM 
ATTENDED, SADIQ WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED. 
 
 
THE GOVERNMENT 
-------------- 
 
4. SADIQ DESCRIBED THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AS HAVING 
THE WORST CHARACTERISTICS OF A DICTATORSHIP AND A 
COALITION GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT, HE SAID, IS 
DIVIDED BETWEEN THE NIP UNDER HASSAN TURABI AND THE 
ARMY, THOUGH HE IMPLIED THAT THE NIF HAD THE UPPER 
HAND NOW.  HASSAN TURABI, SADIQ SAID, IS NOT A TRUE 
ISLAMIST BUT ONE WHO USED ISLAM FOR THE POLITICAL 
BENEFIT.  SADIQ COMMENTED THAT HE HAD BEEN VISITED BY 
MEMBERS OF THE NIP (ALI OSMAN TAHA AND IBRAHIM MAHDI 
AMONG OTHERS) WHO WERE INTERESTED IN SECURING HIS 
SUPPORT.  HE COMMENTED THE NIF HAD DIVISIONS AND 
TURABI WAS AWARE OF THEM. PRESIDENT AL BASHIR HAD 
ALSO VISITED HIM ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION TO DISCUSS 
POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT/SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT, 
SADIQ SAID.  SADIQ SPOKE WELL OF THE HONESTY OF AL 
BASHIR BUT WAS LESS THAN COMPLIMENTARY REGARDING HIS 
INTELLECTUAL ABILITY. 
 
5.  SADIQ WAS VISIBLY UPSET WITH WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS 
THE GOS DISMAL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE WHICH HE 
EMPHASIZED IS CAUSING PEOPLE GREAT SUFFERING.  HE 
ALSO CONDEMNED THE GOS FOR NOT REQUESTING 
INTERNATIONAL AID FOR THE FAMINE VICTIMS AS HE HAD 
DONE WHEN HE WAS PRIME MINISTER.  AMBASSADOR AND 
SADIQ AGREED THAT THE NIF, SPECIFICALLY HASSAN 
TURABI, OPPOSED RELIEF AID EVEN IF ITS LACK WOULD 
CAUSE THE DEATHS OF SUDANESE PEOPLE. 
 
 
PEACE 
----- 
 
6. SADIQ APPRECIATED USG PEACE EFFORTS.  HE 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AT TIMES PROGRESS COULD NOT BE SEEN 
BUT HE SAID THE USG MUST PERSEVERE IN THESE EFFORTS. 
IT WAS ONLY A \"GREAT POWER\" LIKE THE UNITED STATES 
WHICH COULD MOVE BOTH SIDES TOWARD PEACE. PEACE 
REQUIRED A PLURALISTIC, DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY WHICH 
RESPECTED HUMAN RIGHTS.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION, 
SADIQ SAID THE SEPTEMBER LAWS \"MUST GO\".  AMBASSADOR 
PROVIDED A BRIEFING ON USG PEACE EFFORTS AND GAVE A 
COPY OF A/S COHEN\'S SPEECH ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION. 
SADIQ REEMPHASIZED THAT PEACE AND A DEMOCRATIC, 
PLURALISTIC GOVERNMENT WOULD KEEP THE SUDAN FROM 
TURNING INTO A \"MAVERICK COUNTRY\".  PEACE WOULD ALSO 
ALLOW SUDAN TO HAVE NORMAL RELATIONS WITH ITS 
NEIGHBORS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
7. COMMENT: SADIQ SAID MANY THINGS WHICH HE KNEW THE 
USG SUPPORTS.  HE IS IN FAVOR OF COOPERATION ON 
RELIEF, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND A PLURALISTIC DEMOCRATIC 
SOCIETY.  IN SUPPORT OF THE LATTER, IS HIS STATEMENT 
THAT THE SEPTEMBER LAWS MUST GO. 
 
8. SADIQ\'S ASSERTION THAT HE IS BEING VISITED BY THE 
NIF AND OTHERS LOOKING FOR HIS SUPPORT IS TRUE. 
SADIQ IS A WILY AND UNSCRUPULOUS POLITICIAN.  HE IS 
POSITIONING HIMSELF IN THE EVENT THAT THIS GOVERNMENT 
FALLS.  ONE SHOULD NOT TAKE HIS STATEMENT ON THE 
SEPTEMBER LAWS AT FACE VALUE; HE DID NOT SAY HE 
WANTED A SECULAR STATE.  SADIQ COULD FEEL COMFORTABLE 
INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE GOVERNMENT.  HIS OPPOSITION TO 
THIS GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOCTRINE, IT IS OVER WHO HAS 
POWER.

SUBJECT:  ISLAMIZATION OF SOUTHERN SUDAN 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 3990 
 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THERE IS CLEAR AND MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT 
THE NIF-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT IN KHARTOUM HAS EMBARKED ON 
A CAMPAIGN TO ISLAMIZE SOUTHERN SUDAN AND THOSE 
SOUTHERNERS, MOSTLY DISPLACED, LIVING IN THE NORTH.  IN 
GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH, THE GOS/NIF IS 
UNDERTAKING POLICIES TO GAIN ISLAMIC CONTROL OF REGIONAL 
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CIVIL SERVICE.  OVER THE 
PAST TWO YEARS, THE SENIOR AND MIDDLE RANKS OF LOCAL 
ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL SERVICE HAVE BEEN \"WEEDED-OUT\", 
WITH MUSLIM-SOUTHERNERS AND HARDLINE GOS/NIF SUPPORTERS 
REPLACING PROFESSIONAL SENIOR OFFICERS AND OTHER 
EMPLOYEES.  FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF GOS EDUCATIONAL 
POLICIES, NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN IN THE GOS-CONTROLLED TOWNS 
OF JUBA, RENK, MALAKAL, WAU, AND RAJA ARE COMPELLED TO 
LEARN ARABIC AND STUDY ISLAM.  SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO 
USE ARABIC AS THE SOLE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION, EVEN 
SCHOOLS RUN BY CHRISTIANS.  IN JUBA, THE EQUATORIA STATE 
MINISTER OF EDUCATION RECENTLY DECREED THAT ISLAM MUST BE 
TAUGHT BEGINNING AT THE NURSERY SCHOOL LEVEL. 
 
3.  IN THE NORTH, NON-MUSLIM, SOUTHERNERS FACE ROUTINE 
HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION, CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING THE 
MESSAGE THAT IF THEY BECOME MUSLIMS, THEIR LIVES WILL 
IMPROVE.  ISLAMIC GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY THE DA\'WA 
ISLAMIYYA (I.E. THE ISLAMIC CALL), OFFER AID IN THE FORM 
OF FOOD AND MONEY TO INDUCE SOUTHERNERS TO BECOME 
MUSLIMS.  GOS/NIF POLICY HAS MADE CONVERSION TO ISLAM 
CONVENIENT, OFTEN PROFITABLE, AND SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR 
SURVIVAL IN THE NORTH. 
 
4.  IN ADDITION, THE GOS IS ESCALATING PRESSURE ON 
CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL AND INSTITUTIONS.  REPORTS 
OF HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION, AND INCARCERATION OF CHURCH 
PERSONNEL HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT MONTHS.  MANY BELIEVE 
THAT THIS IS EVIDENCE OF GOS/NIF INTENTION TO EVENTUALLY 
ERADICATE THE \"FOREIGN\" CHURCH PRESENCE FROM SUDAN, 
THEREBY, THE GOS/NIF HOPES, LEAVING THE FIELD OPEN FOR 
ISLAM. 
 
5.  THE GOS/NIF IS DETERMINED TO LAUNCH A SUCCESSFUL 
ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN.  IT HAS CONSOLIDATED ITS HOLD OVER 
LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF 
THE SOUTH, WITH THE REPUTED LONG-TERM GOAL OF INTRODUCING 
ISLAMIC LAW TO THE SOUTH.  ALSO IMPORTANT IS THE EFFECT 
GOS/NIF POLICIES HAVE ON SOUTHERN CHILDREN.  THESE 
CHILDREN ARE COMPELLED TO LEARN ARABIC AND ISLAM AND ARE 
LEARNING TO LOOK TO MUSLIMS FOR FOOD AND AID.  THEY ARE 
ALSO ABSORBING THE LESSON THAT NON-MUSLIMS PROBABLY HAVE 
LITTLE HOPE OR FUTURE IN SUDAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
GOVERNMENT IN THE SOUTH 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
6.  IN 1990, THE GOS DECLARED A FEDERAL SYSTEM OF 
GOVERNMENT FOR SUDAN, OSTENSIBLY GIVING GOS-CONTROLLED 
AREAS OF THE SOUTH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AUTONOMY AND 
EXEMPTING THEM FROM SHARIA (I.E. ISLAMIC LAW). 
SUBSEQUENTLY, HOWEVER, KHARTOUM BEGAN A LARGE-SCALE PURGE 
OF SOUTHERN REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CIVIL 
SERVICE, REPLACING MANY NON-MUSLIMS WITH SOUTHERN MUSLIMS 
AND GOS/NIF HARDLINE SUPPORTERS. 
 
7.  SOUTHERN SUDAN IS DIVIDED INTO THREE STATES:  UPPER 
NILE, BAHR EL GHAZAL, AND EQUATORIA.  EACH STATE HAS A 
GOVERNOR, DEPUTY GOVERNOR, AND A POPULAR COMMITTEE.  THE 
GOVERNORS, APPOINTED BY KHARTOUM, ARE ALL NON-MUSLIM 
SOUTHERNERS.  FOLLOWING ITS DECLARATION OF FEDERALISM, 
THE GOS APPOINTED HARDCORE NIF SUPPORTERS AS DEPUTY 
GOVERNORS AND AS STATE MINISTERS OF EDUCATION AND 
CULTURE, FINANCE AND COMMERCE.  THESE APPOINTEES 
REPORTEDLY ANSWER ONLY TO KHARTOUM.  THE DEPUTY 
GOVERNORS, AND NOT THE GOVERNORS AS BEFORE, HAVE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE KEY MINISTRIES.  IT IS ALSO 
RELIABLY REPORTED THAT THESE STATE MINISTERS HAVE PURGED, 
OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PURGING, THEIR STAFFS OF 
NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF SUPPORTERS.  THE GOVERNORS HAVE 
THUS BEEN EFFECTIVELY STRIPPED OF MOST REAL POWER.  IN 
ADDITION, ON AUGUST 8, TWO SENIOR AND PROMINENT SOUTHERN 
GOVERNORS WERE REPLACED (REF).  THE NEW GOVERNORS ARE 
ALSO NON-MUSLIM SOUTHERNERS BUT BOTH MEN ARE FIRM 
SUPPORTERS OF THE NIF.  (NOTE:  IN A NATIONALLY-TELEVISED 
SWEARING-IN CEREMONY, THE NEWLY-APPOINTED GOVERNORS WERE 
SHOWN TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE, ONE HAND RAISED, THE 
OTHER ON THE KORAN.  END NOTE. 
 
8.  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN THE 
SENIOR AND MIDDLE RANKS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL 
SERVICE IN GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS HAVE BEEN \"WEEDED-OUT\" 
AND REPLACED BY MUSLIM-SOUTHERNERS AND HARDLINE GOS/NIF 
SUPPORTERS.  HISTORICALLY, THE BEST SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTH 
HAVE BEEN CHURCH SCHOOLS, SO THE BEST-EDUCATED AND MOST 
EXPERIENCED CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE SOUTH ARE OFTEN 
CHRISTIANS.  MANY OF THOSE REPLACING THEM ARE LESS 
QUALIFIED AND LACK EXPERIENCE; THEIR ONLY QUALIFICATION 
IS THAT THEY ARE MUSLIMS.  FORCED RETIREMENT OF 
NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF SUPPORTERS HAS BECOME WIDESPREAD. 
THERE ARE NOW MANY EDUCATED AND ARTICULATE SOUTHERNERS 
ENCOUNTERED INCREASINGLY IN KHARTOUM WHO \"USED TO DO 
SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN THE SOUTH.\" 
 
9.  IN JULY 1991, A GOS-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPER REPORTED 
THAT THE EQUATORIA POPULAR COMMITTEE HAD BEEN GIVEN 
LEGISLATIVE POWERS, AND THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD 
HENCEFORTH FORMULATE AND PASS LOCAL LAWS.  (NOTE:  THE 
POPULAR COMMITTEES IN BAHR AL GHAZAL AND UPPER NILE WILL 
APPARENTLY HAVE THE SAME MANDATE, ALTHOUGH THERE HAS AS 
YET BEEN NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
OPERATING IN THIS MANNER.  END NOTE)  THIS IS IN 
CONTRAST, THE NEWSPAPER POINTED OUT, TO THE POPULAR 
COMMITTEES IN THE NORTH WHICH ARE SOLELY CONSULTATIVE AND 
REGULATORY BODIES.  THE MEMBERS OF THE SOUTHERN POPULAR 
COMMITTEES, IT WAS REPORTED, WILL BE \"SELECTED\" TO 
\"REPRESENT THE PEOPLE UNTIL ELECTIONS ARE HELD.\" 
ELECTIONS, THE NEWSPAPER EXPLAINED, CANNOT BE HELD NOW 
BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR.  (FYI:  THIS WAS PREDICTED BY 
OUR SOUTHERN CONTACTS.  END FYI.) 
 
10.  COMMENT:  IN EFFECT, THE GOS/NIF IS \"PACKING\" THESE 
QUASI-PARLIAMENTS.  IT IS REPORTED THAT BRIBERY, IN THE 
FORM OF MONEY, HOUSES, AND POWER, IS OFTEN USED TO GAIN 
THE SUPPORT OF SOUTHERNERS WHO ARE THEN APPOINTED TO THE 
POPULAR COMMITTEES.  THUS, SOME SOUTHERN POLITICIANS, FOR 
FINANCIAL GAIN, SUPPORT THE GOS/NIF AND ITS POLICIES. 
SOME SOUTHERNERS FEAR THAT THE POPULAR 
COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLIES WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED TO \"OPT 
INTO SHARIA.\"  IN EARLY 1991, IN A CONVERSATION WITH 
CHARGE, NIF LEADER HASAN AL-TURABI STATED THAT IF PEOPLE 
IN THE SOUTH VOTED FOR SHARIA IT WOULD BECOME LAW.  IN 
HIS SPEECH OF DECEMBER 31, PRESIDENT AL-BASHIR SAID \"THE 
LEGAL SITUATION IN THE SOUTHERN STATES WILL REMAIN AS IT 
IS UNTIL ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW LEGISLATIVE BODIES THAT 
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED....\"  BECAUSE OF THE VAGUENESS OF 
THIS STATEMENT, SOME OBSERVERS FEAR THAT BASHIR SUBTLY 
OPENED UP THE POSSIBILITY THAT SHARIA MIGHT ONE DAY BE 
LEGISLATED FOR THE SOUTH.  THE MAJORITY OF SOUTHERNERS 
ARE NOT MUSLIMS AND, BY ALL INDICATIONS, DO NOT WANT TO 
BE GOVERNED BY ISLAMIC LAW.  SOUTHERNERS FEAR THAT THE 
GOS/NIF WILL MANIPULATE THE POPULAR COMMITTEES SO THEY 
WILL VOTE TO MAKE SHARIA LAW IN THE SOUTH.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
THE CIVIL SERVICE 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
11.  IN 1991, THE GOS REPORTEDLY RECONSTITUTED THE CIVIL 
SERVICE IN SUDAN.  PREVIOUSLY, NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN 
SUDAN EACH HAD THEIR OWN SEPARATE CIVIL SERVICE.  UNDER 
THE NEW LAWS, SUDAN HAS A SINGLE CIVIL SERVICE 
ADMINISTERED BY AUTHORITIES IN KHARTOUM.  GOS-APPOINTED 
\"SECRETARY GENERALS,\" ALL KNOWN NIF SUPPORTERS, DIRECTLY 
CONTROL THE CIVIL BUREAUCRACY IN EACH SOUTHERN STATE. 
THROUGH THE SECRETARY GENERALS, THE GOS/NIF CONTROLS 
RECRUITMENT OF NEW EMPLOYEES, JOB ASSIGNMENTS, AND 
PROMOTIONS.  THERE ARE REPORTS OF NON-MUSLIMS BEING 
SIDESTEPPED FOR PROMOTIONS, SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS BEING 
REPLACED BY INEXPERIENCED NIF SUPPORTERS, AND NUMEROUS 
INSTANCES OF FORCED RETIREMENT OF NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF 
SUPPORTERS. 
 
 
ISLAMIZATION/ARABIZATION OF EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
12.  IN ADDITION TO POLICIES DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN 
GOS/NIF CONTROL OVER SOUTHERN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, THE 
EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM IN THE SOUTH IS BEING ARABIZED AND 
ISLAMIZED.  REPORTEDLY, THE EQUATORIA STATE MINISTER OF 
EDUCATION RECENTLY DECREED THAT ISLAM BE A COMPULSORY 
SUBJECT IN ALL NURSERY SCHOOLS IN JUBA (NOTE: STUDENTS 
CANNOT ENTER PRIMARY SCHOOL UNLESS THEY HAVE COMPLETED 
NURSERY SCHOOL.  END NOTE).  IN JUBA, IT IS REPORTEDLY 
ALSO OFFICIAL POLICY THAT ALL SCHOOLS, INCLUDING THOSE 
RUN BY CHRISTIANS, MUST USE ARABIC AS THE LANGUAGE OF 
INSTRUCTION, AND ENGLISH MAY NOT BE INTRODUCED AS A 
SUBJECT UNTIL THE FIFTH GRADE. 
 
13.  IN MALAKAL, IN UPPER NILE STATE, THE ONLY SCHOOL 
STILL OPEN IS RUN BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  (NOTE: ALL 
OTHER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER AS GOS-ARMY BARRACKS. 
END NOTE).  CHURCH SOURCES REPORT THAT THE UPPER NILE 
MINISTER OF EDUCATION INFORMED THE SCHOOL IN JULY THAT 
ARABIC MUST BE THE SOLE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION. 
(COMMENT:  THE CHURCH SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE ARABIC LANGUAGE 
TEXTS OR TEACHERS QUALIFIED TO TEACH IN ARABIC.  FOR THE 
TIME BEING THEY CONTINUE TO TEACH IN ENGLISH, DESPITE THE 
OFFICIAL ORDER.  END COMMENT.) 
 
14.  GOS/NIF POLICY HAS LED TO A PROLIFERATION OF 
\"KHALWAS,\" I.E. ISLAMIC PRIMARY SCHOOLS, IN 
GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH.  STUDENTS NOT 
ATTENDING THESE SCHOOLS ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN THEY 
GO ON TO SECONDARY SCHOOL SINCE THEY LACK SKILLS IN 
ARABIC.  MOREOVER, PROPOSED NEW NATIONAL LEGISLATION 
WOULD MAKE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ISLAMIC AND ARABIC 
STUDIES AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL COMPULSORY FOR CONTINUING 
ON TO UNIVERSITY STUDIES. 
 
15.  HUMAN RIGHTS SOURCES REPORT THAT NORTHERN SECURITY 
FORCES, PRESENT IN GOS-CONTROLLED CITIES SINCE LAST YEAR, 
SOMETIMES BRING NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN INTO THE KHALWAS 
AGAINST THE WISHES OF THEIR PARENTS.  LIKE THE SECURITY 
FORCES OPERATING IN KHARTOUM, THESE WELL-ARMED FORCES 
REPORTEDLY OPERATE ABOVE THE POLICE AND THE ARMY; TO WHOM 
OR WHAT INSTITUTIONS THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE IS UNKNOWN. 
 
 
\"RICE MUSLIMS\" IN THE SOUTH 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
16.  AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL, SOUTHERNERS ARE BEING 
CONVERTED TO ISLAM WITH FOOD AND MONEY.  THROUGHOUT 
GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH THE THREAT OF 
STARVATION IS VERY REAL.  OPERATING IN THESE AREAS ARE 
MUSLIM GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY THE DA\'WA, WHICH DISTRIBUTE 
FOOD AND OTHER AID.  THEY REPORTEDLY GIVE AID ONLY TO 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO DECLARE THEMSELVES TO BE MUSLIMS AND 
REGISTER AS SUCH.  SIMILARLY, GOS/NIF-SUPPORTED KHALWAS 
PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND OFFER OTHER FORMS OF 
AID, WHILE GOS-RESTRICTIONS ON CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS 
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE 
SIMILAR ASSISTANCE.  EVEN SOME DEVOUTLY CHRISTIAN PARENTS 
SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THESE SCHOOLS RATHER THAN DEPRIVE 
THEM OF FOOD.  THERE ARE ISOLATED REPORTS OF MONEY AND 
FOOD BEING OFFERED TO PREGNANT MOTHERS TO REGISTER THEIR 
NEWBORNS AS MUSLIMS AND OF PARENTS BEING PAID TO SEND 
THEIR CHILDREN TO KHALWAS. 
 
17.  COMMENT:  MANY CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS WE HAVE 
TALKED TO ARE CONVINCED THAT THE MAJORITY OF SOUTHERNERS 
CONVERTING TO ISLAM ARE \"RICE MUSLIMS, I.E. THAT THEY ARE 
DOING SO SOLELY BECAUSE THEY WANT FOOD.  THESE LEADERS 
BELIEVE THAT FEW HAVE ACTUALLY ACCEPTED ISLAM AND THAT 
MOST OF THEM WILL REVERT TO THEIR FORMER RELIGION WHEN 
STARVATION IS NOT A CONSTANT THREAT. 
18.  OF MORE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCE, HOWEVER, IS THE 
EFFECT ISLAMIZATION MAY HAVE ON CHILDREN IN 
GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS.  A GENERATION OF NON-MUSLIM 
CHILDREN NOW SPEAK BETTER ARABIC THAN THEIR TRIBAL 
LANGUAGE AND ARE TAKING TO ISLAMIC CUSTOMS.  WHEN THEY 
ARE HUNGRY THEY CAN GO TO THE KHALWA, TO THE MOSQUE, OR 
TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE DA\'WA, BUT THEY CANNOT EXPECT 
THE SAME PROVISIONS FROM THE NEEDY CHURCHES.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
... AND IN THE NORTH 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
19.  IN THE NORTH, WHERE AS MUCH AS ONE-QUARTER OF THE 
POPULATION OF SOUTHERN SUDAN IS NOW DISPLACED (AS MANY AS 
2,500,000 PEOPLE), THE NEED FOR AID IS ACUTE.  MOST 
DISPLACED LIVE IN CAMPS OUTSIDE KHARTOUM, WITH MEAGER 
FACILITIES AND FEW RESOURCES.  AS IN THE SOUTH, ISLAMIC 
GROUPS, INCLUDING THE DA\'WA, DISPENSE RELIEF.  THIS 
RELIEF IS, ONCE AGAIN, RESERVED FOR MUSLIMS.  ONE SOURCE 
REPORTS HAVING GONE WITH A GROUP OF REFUGEES TO RECEIVE 
FOOD.  HE RECOUNTED HOW EACH REFUGEE WAS ASKED TO GIVE 
THEIR NAME.  IF THEY GAVE A MUSLIM NAME, THEY WERE GIVEN 
FOOD; IF THEY GAVE A CHRISTIAN NAME, THEY WERE NOT.  THEY 
HAD THE OPTION, OF COURSE, OF CONVERTING, TAKING A MUSLIM 
NAME, AND THEN RECEIVING FOOD.  (NOTE: IN ISLAM, A SIMPLE 
DECLARATION IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED FOR CONVERSION.  END 
NOTE) 
 
20.  NON-MUSLIM SOUTHERNERS IN THE NORTH ARE ROUTINELY 
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN SCHOOLS, THE WORKPLACE, AND IN 
THEIR EVERYDAY EXISTENCE.  AT THE SAME TIME IT IS MADE 
CLEAR THAT IF THEY BECOME MUSLIMS THEIR LIVES WILL BE 
MUCH EASIER.  MANY SOURCES REPORT THAT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, 
NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN ARE HARASSED, GIRLS ARE PROPOSITIONED 
AND INSULTED, AND NON-MUSLIM STUDENTS ARE OFTEN GRADED 
UNFAIRLY.  THEY ALSO ARE COMPELLED TO STUDY ARABIC AND 
ISLAM.  ALTHOUGH SOME SCHOOLS, RUN BY SOUTHERNERS, EXIST 
IN THE DISPLACED CAMPS, REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE GOS/NIF 
PLANS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEM.  THE GOS DESIRES TO PLACE 
MUSLIM NORTHERNERS AS INSTRUCTORS TO TEACH ARABIC AND 
ISLAM TO THE DISPLACED.  AS WITH THE SOUTH, GOS/NIF 
ISLAMIZATION POLICIES ARE CLEARLY AIMED AT CHILDREN OF 
SOUTHERNERS.  SUCH POLICIES HAVE SERIOUS LONG-TERM 
RAMIFICATIONS FOR NON-MUSLIMS IN THE NORTH. 
 
21.  SOUTHERNERS ALSO OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING 
EMPLOYMENT.  OUR SOURCES REPORT THAT CHRISTIAN EMPLOYEES 
ARE FREQUENTLY SINGLED OUT FOR JOBS WHICH REQUIRE THEM TO 
WORK DURING SUNDAY MASS OR ON THEIR RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS. 
IN KHARTOUM THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS REPORTS OF 
CHRISTIANS BEING EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES BY MUSLIM 
LANDLORDS; SOME OF THESE LANDLORDS REPORT THAT THEY ARE 
PRESSURED NOT TO RENT TO CHRISTIANS. 
 
22.  IN ADDITION TO THIS OVERT DISCRIMINATION, 
SOUTHERNERS IN THE NORTH ARE BEING EFFECTIVELY ISLAMIZED 
BY THEIR ENVIRONMENT.  SOUTHERNERS IN THE NORTH KEEP AN 
ISLAMIC WORK WEEK (SUN-THURS).  THEY RECEIVE BONUSES AND 
VACATIONS FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS FOR RAMADAN AND THE EID, 
BUT NOT FOR CHRISTMAS OR EASTER; THEIR FAMILIES THUS ARE 
BEGINNING TO CELEBRATE ISLAMIC HOLIDAYS.  SOME CHRISTIAN 
SOUTHERNERS HAVE ALSO BEGUN TAKING PART IN GOS-SPONSORED 
\"MASS MARRIAGES.\"  THIS IS A PRACTICE INTRODUCED BY THE 
GOS IN RECENT MONTHS TO PROMOTE THE INSTITUTION OF 
MARRIAGE AS A SOCIALLY STABILIZING FORCE.  PUBLIC 
CEREMONIES ARE CONDUCTED IN WHICH LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE 
ARE MARRIED BEFORE MUSLIM AND, IN A FEW CASES, CHRISTIAN 
CLERGY.  COUPLES MARRYING IN THESE MASS CEREMONIES 
RECEIVE MONEY AND GIFTS FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  (NOTE: 
THESE MARRIAGES HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED BY THE CHRISTIAN 
CHURCH AS AN ATTEMPT TO ATTRACT NON-MUSLIMS TO ISLAM. 
END NOTE).  MANY SOUTHERN WOMEN IN THE NORTH ARE DONNING 
THE TRADITIONAL NORTHERN FEMALE DRESS, THE TOBE.  THE 
TOBE IS A GARMENT WHICH COVERS A WOMAN UP FROM HEAD TO 
FOOT BUT NOT THE FACE.  THOSE WOMEN WHO WEAR THE TOBE ARE 
GENERALLY SPARED SOME HARASSMENT. 
 
23.  COMMENT:  AS A RESULT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THE 
GOS/NIF\'S ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN, MANY SOUTHERNERS IN THE 
NORTH NOW SPEAK ARABIC, STUDY ISLAM, AND TAKE TO ISLAMIC 
CUSTOMS.  BOTH YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE ARE GIVEN THE SAME 
MESSAGE, BLATANTLY OR SUBTLY--THAT IT IS BETTER TO BE A 
MUSLIM THAN A NON-MUSLIM.  GOS/NIF POLICIES HAVE 
ACCORDINGLY MADE BECOMING A MUSLIM CONVENIENT, OFTEN 
PROFITABLE, AND SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL IN THE 
NORTH.  END COMMENT 
 
 
RECEPTIVITY TO ISLAM 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
24.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SOME SOUTHERNERS, WHETHER 
LIVING IN THE NORTH OR THE SOUTH, ARE MORE RECEPTIVE TO 
ISLAM THEN OTHERS, DEPENDING ON THEIR TRIBAL AND REGIONAL 
BACKGROUND.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE TRIBES IN THE UPPER NILE 
REGION (DINKA, SHILLUK, NUER) ARE REPORTEDLY LESS 
SUSCEPTIBLE TO ISLAMIZATION, GIVEN THEIR STRONG TRIBAL 
TRADITIONS AND STRUCTURES.  THEIR CULTURAL BACKGROUND, 
INCLUDING EXPERIENCE WITH SLAVERY AND COLONIALISM ALSO 
MAKES THEM SUSPICIOUS OF OUTSIDE INFLUENCE.  TRIBES IN 
EQUATORIA ARE, APPARENTLY, NOT AT ALL OPEN TO ISLAM. 
EQUATORIA HAS NO BORDERS WITH THE NORTH AND THERE HAS 
BEEN HISTORICALLY LITTLE CONTACT OR ASSIMILATION.  MOST 
EQUATORIANS ARE FOLLOWERS OF TRADITIONAL RELIGIONS AND 
THEY MAINTAIN STRONG CULTURAL AND TRIBAL CUSTOMS. 
SLAVERY AND ITS ATTENDANT WARFARE HAVE MADE THEM HOSTILE 
TO OUTSIDERS, ESPECIALLY MUSLIMS. 
 
25.  IN CONTRAST, TRIBES LIVING ON THE BORDER WITH THE 
NORTH, DUE TO LONG-TERM INTERACTION WITH NORTHERNERS, ARE 
ALREADY SOMEWHAT ASSIMILATED AND THUS, OUR SOURCES 
SPECULATE, MORE RECEPTIVE TO ISLAM.  THE TRIBES IN BAHR 
EL GHAZAL, IN SOUTH EASTERN SUDAN, HAVE HISTORICALLY 
INTERMARRIED AND MIXED WITH THE NORTHERNERS LIVING ON 
THEIR BORDERS.  THEY HAVE ASSIMILATED FOR CONVENIENCE AND 
ARE, AS A RESULT, MORE EASILY ISLAMIZED. 
 
 
HARASSMENT OF CHURCHES 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
26.  THE ACTIVITIES OF NON-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, 
INCLUDING SCHOOLS, HAVE BEEN SHARPLY CURTAILED BY THE 
GOS.  USING THE 1962 FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY ACT AS A 
TOOL, THE GOS FORBIDS THE BUILDING OF CHURCHES, CHURCH 
FACILITIES (INCLUDING SCHOOLS) AND THE ORGANIZATION OF 
CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES.  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS 
ORGANIZATIONS ARE MONITORED CLOSELY AND THE AMOUNT OF 
FUNDS THEY MAY EXPEND IS LIMITED BY GOS REGULATIONS.  THE 
RESULTING LACK OF RESOURCES MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE 
CHURCHES TO COMPETE WITH MUSLIM GROUPS.  THE DA\'WA, AND 
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE IT, ARE ABLE TO OFFER FOOD, CLOTHING, 
AND OTHER FORMS OF AID, WHILE MANY CHRISTIAN 
ORGANIZATIONS CAN, IN COMPARISON, OFFER LITTLE MORE THAN 
FAITH.  IN THE GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH, 
NUMEROUS MOSQUES AND KHALWAS ARE BEING BUILT WHILE 
CHURCHES CONTINUE TO BE DENIED PERMITS TO BUILD OR REPAIR 
FACILITIES. 
 
27.  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL THROUGHOUT SUDAN ARE 
ROUTINELY HARASSED AND INTIMIDATED.  THOSE WORKING FOR 
CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN SUDAN FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME CAN 
EXPECT TO BE INTERROGATED AND/OR ARRESTED BY SECURITY. 
RECENTLY THE GOS INCARCERATED A CATHOLIC PRIEST AND THREE 
OF HIS STAFF IN DONGOLA, IN NORTHERN SUDAN, AND TRIED TO 
EXPEL FOUR OF MOTHER TERESA\'S MISSIONARIES.  MANY 
SUDANESE CHRISTIANS, AS WELL AS SOME RESIDENT DIPLOMATS, 
BELIEVE THAT THIS TREATMENT OF THE CHURCHES AND THEIR 
LOCAL AND FOREIGN PERSONNEL IS EVIDENCE OF GOS/NIF 
INTENTION TO EVENTUALLY ERADICATE THE \"FOREIGN\" CHURCH 
PRESENCE FROM SUDAN, THUS LEAVING THE FIELD OPEN TO 
ISLAM. 
 
COMMENT AND CONCLUSION 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
28.  THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO DOUBT THAT THIS 
NIF-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT HOPES TO ISLAMIZE SOUTHERN SUDAN 
AND THOSE SOUTHERNERS LIVING IN THE NORTH.  GOS/NIF 
POLICIES SEEM DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT SOUTHERN MUSLIMS 
AND THEIR SYCOPHANTS WILL DOMINATE SOUTHERN POLITICS. 
SUCH TACTICS FUEL SOUTHERNERS\' WELL-FOUNDED FEARS THAT 
THEY WILL EVENTUALLY BE GOVERNED BY SHARIA.  THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CHURCH, ALREADY 
UNFRIENDLY AND INHOSPITABLE, IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE 
OBSTRUCTIONIST.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE CHILDREN OF 
SOUTHERNERS, THE NEXT GENERATION OF SOUTHERN CITIZENS AND 
LEADERS, ARE BEING AGGRESSIVELY ISLAMIZED AND ARABIZED. 
THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SUDAN\'S FUTURE, IF THIS EFFORT IS 
SUCCESSFUL, WILL BE RADICAL AND TRANSFORMING AND WILL 
IMPACT ON THE STABILITY OF THE ENTIRE REGION.

1.  PER DEPARTMENT\'S REQUEST, AND RECOGNIZING THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE UNHRC RAPPORTEUR\'S WORK, WE HAVE 
TRANSMITTED A DESENSITIZED VERSION OF KHARTOUM 4769 
BELOW.  WE HAVE TRIED TO ELIMINATED DIRECT REFERENCES TO 
SOURCES AND OTHER IDENTIFYING DETAILS.  THE CABLE 
NEVERTHELESS CONTAINS INFORMATION, SUCH AS THE REPORT 
THAT THE DA\'WA TURNS AWAY NON-MUSLIMS WHEN DISTRIBUTING 
ASSISTANCE, WHICH COULD INVITE NEGATIVE REACTION IF MADE 
PUBLIC.  THEREFORE THIS CABLE SHOULD BE USED ONLY RPT 
ONLY FOR MR. RIBEIRO\'S BACKGROUND INFORMATION. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THERE IS CLEAR AND MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT 
THE NIF-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT IN KHARTOUM HAS EMBARKED ON 
A CAMPAIGN TO ISLAMIZE SOUTHERN SUDAN AND THOSE 
SOUTHERNERS, MOSTLY DISPLACED, LIVING IN THE NORTH.  IN 
GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH, THE GOS/NIF IS 
UNDERTAKING POLICIES TO GAIN ISLAMIC CONTROL OF REGIONAL 
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CIVIL SERVICE.  OVER THE 
PAST TWO YEARS, THE SENIOR AND MIDDLE RANKS OF LOCAL 
ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL SERVICE HAVE BEEN \"WEEDED-OUT\", 
WITH MUSLIM-SOUTHERNERS AND HARDLINE GOS/NIF SUPPORTERS 
REPLACING PROFESSIONAL SENIOR OFFICERS AND OTHER 
EMPLOYEES.  FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF GOS EDUCATIONAL 
POLICIES, NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN IN THE GOS-CONTROLLED TOWNS 
OF JUBA, RENK, MALAKAL, WAU, AND RAJA ARE COMPELLED TO 
LEARN ARABIC AND STUDY ISLAM.  SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO 
USE ARABIC AS THE SOLE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION, EVEN 
SCHOOLS RUN BY CHRISTIANS.  IN JUBA, THE EQUATORIA STATE 
MINISTER OF EDUCATION RECENTLY DECREED THAT ISLAM MUST BE 
TAUGHT BEGINNING AT THE NURSERY SCHOOL LEVEL. 
 
3.  IN THE NORTH, NON-MUSLIM, SOUTHERNERS FACE ROUTINE 
HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION, CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING THE 
MESSAGE THAT IF THEY BECOME MUSLIMS, THEIR LIVES WILL 
IMPROVE.  ISLAMIC GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY THE DA\'WA 
ISLAMIYYA (I.E. THE ISLAMIC CALL), REPORTEDLY OFFER AID 
IN THE FORM OF FOOD AND MONEY TO INDUCE SOUTHERNERS TO 
BECOME MUSLIMS.  GOS/NIF POLICY HAS MADE CONVERSION TO 
ISLAM CONVENIENT, OFTEN PROFITABLE, AND SOMETIMES 
NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL IN THE NORTH. 
 
4.  IN ADDITION, THE GOS IS ESCALATING PRESSURE ON 
CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL AND INSTITUTIONS.  REPORTS 
OF HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION, AND INCARCERATION OF CHURCH 
PERSONNEL HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT MONTHS.  MANY BELIEVE 
THAT THIS IS EVIDENCE OF GOS/NIF INTENTION TO EVENTUALLY 
ERADICATE THE \"FOREIGN\" CHURCH PRESENCE FROM SUDAN, 
THEREBY, THE GOS/NIF HOPES, LEAVING THE FIELD OPEN FOR 
ISLAM. 
 
5.  THE GOS/NIF IS DETERMINED TO LAUNCH A SUCCESSFUL 
ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN.  IT HAS CONSOLIDATED ITS HOLD OVER 
LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF 
THE SOUTH, WITH THE REPUTED LONG-TERM GOAL OF INTRODUCING 
ISLAMIC LAW TO THE SOUTH.  ALSO IMPORTANT IS THE EFFECT 
GOS/NIF POLICIES HAVE ON SOUTHERN CHILDREN.  THESE 
CHILDREN ARE COMPELLED TO LEARN ARABIC AND ISLAM AND ARE 
LEARNING TO LOOK TO MUSLIMS FOR FOOD AND AID.  THEY ARE 
ALSO ABSORBING THE LESSON THAT NON-MUSLIMS PROBABLY HAVE 
LITTLE HOPE OR FUTURE IN SUDAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
GOVERNMENT IN THE SOUTH 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
6.  IN 1990, THE GOS DECLARED A FEDERAL SYSTEM OF 
GOVERNMENT FOR SUDAN, OSTENSIBLY GIVING GOS-CONTROLLED 
AREAS OF THE SOUTH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AUTONOMY AND 
EXEMPTING THEM FROM SHARIA (I.E. ISLAMIC LAW). 
SUBSEQUENTLY, HOWEVER, KHARTOUM BEGAN A LARGE-SCALE PURGE 
OF SOUTHERN REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CIVIL 
SERVICE, REPLACING MANY NON-MUSLIMS WITH SOUTHERN MUSLIMS 
AND GOS/NIF HARDLINE SUPPORTERS. 
 
7.  SOUTHERN SUDAN IS DIVIDED INTO THREE STATES:  UPPER 
NILE, BAHR EL GHAZAL, AND EQUATORIA.  EACH STATE HAS A 
GOVERNOR, DEPUTY GOVERNOR, AND A POPULAR COMMITTEE.  THE 
GOVERNORS, APPOINTED BY KHARTOUM, ARE ALL NON-MUSLIM 
SOUTHERNERS.  FOLLOWING ITS DECLARATION OF FEDERALISM, 
THE GOS APPOINTED HARDCORE NIF SUPPORTERS AS DEPUTY 
GOVERNORS AND AS STATE MINISTERS OF EDUCATION AND 
CULTURE, FINANCE AND COMMERCE.  THESE APPOINTEES 
REPORTEDLY ANSWER ONLY TO KHARTOUM.  THE DEPUTY 
GOVERNORS, AND NOT THE GOVERNORS AS BEFORE, HAVE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE KEY MINISTRIES.  IT IS ALSO 
RELIABLY REPORTED THAT THESE STATE MINISTERS HAVE PURGED, 
OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PURGING, THEIR STAFFS OF 
NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF SUPPORTERS.  THE GOVERNORS HAVE 
THUS BEEN EFFECTIVELY STRIPPED OF MOST REAL POWER.  IN 
ADDITION, ON AUGUST 8, TWO SENIOR AND PROMINENT SOUTHERN 
GOVERNORS WERE REPLACED (REF).  THE NEW GOVERNORS ARE 
ALSO NON-MUSLIM SOUTHERNERS BUT BOTH MEN ARE FIRM 
SUPPORTERS OF THE NIF.  (NOTE:  IN A NATIONALLY-TELEVISED 
SWEARING-IN CEREMONY, THE NEWLY-APPOINTED GOVERNORS WERE 
SHOWN TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE, ONE HAND RAISED, THE 
OTHER ON THE KORAN.  END NOTE. 
 
8.  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN THE 
SENIOR AND MIDDLE RANKS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL 
SERVICE IN GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS HAVE BEEN \"WEEDED-OUT\" 
AND REPLACED BY MUSLIM-SOUTHERNERS AND HARDLINE GOS/NIF 
SUPPORTERS.  HISTORICALLY, THE BEST SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTH 
HAVE BEEN CHURCH SCHOOLS, SO THE BEST-EDUCATED AND MOST 
EXPERIENCED CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE SOUTH ARE OFTEN 
CHRISTIANS.  MANY OF THOSE REPLACING THEM ARE LESS 
QUALIFIED AND LACK EXPERIENCE; THEIR ONLY QUALIFICATION 
IS THAT THEY ARE MUSLIMS.  FORCED RETIREMENT OF 
NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF SUPPORTERS HAS BECOME WIDESPREAD. 
 
9.  IN JULY 1991, A GOS-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPER REPORTED 
THAT THE EQUATORIA POPULAR COMMITTEE HAD BEEN GIVEN 
LEGISLATIVE POWERS, AND THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD 
HENCEFORTH FORMULATE AND PASS LOCAL LAWS.  (NOTE:  THE 
POPULAR COMMITTEES IN BAHR AL GHAZAL AND UPPER NILE WILL 
APPARENTLY HAVE THE SAME MANDATE, ALTHOUGH THERE HAS AS 
YET BEEN NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
OPERATING IN THIS MANNER.  END NOTE)  THIS IS IN 
CONTRAST, THE NEWSPAPER POINTED OUT, TO THE POPULAR 
COMMITTEES IN THE NORTH WHICH ARE SOLELY CONSULTATIVE AND 
REGULATORY BODIES.  THE MEMBERS OF THE SOUTHERN POPULAR 
COMMITTEES, IT WAS REPORTED, WILL BE \"SELECTED\" TO 
\"REPRESENT THE PEOPLE UNTIL ELECTIONS ARE HELD.\" 
ELECTIONS, THE NEWSPAPER EXPLAINED, CANNOT BE HELD NOW 
BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
10.  COMMENT:  IT IS REPORTED THAT MONEY, HOUSES, AND 
POWER, IS USED BY THE GOS OFTEN TO GAIN THE SUPPORT OF 
SOUTHERNERS WHO ARE THEN APPOINTED TO THE POPULAR 
COMMITTEES.  THUS, SOME SOUTHERN POLITICIANS, FOR 
FINANCIAL GAIN, SUPPORT THE GOS/NIF AND ITS POLICIES. 
THERE IS SOME FEAR THAT THE POPULAR COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLIES 
WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED TO \"OPT INTO SHARIA.\"  IN HIS 
SPEECH OF DECEMBER 31, PRESIDENT AL-BASHIR SAID \"THE 
LEGAL SITUATION IN THE SOUTHERN STATES WILL REMAIN AS IT 
IS UNTIL ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW LEGISLATIVE BODIES THAT 
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED....\"  BECAUSE OF THE VAGUENESS OF 
THIS STATEMENT, BASHIR MAY HAVE SUBTLY OPENED UP THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT SHARIA MIGHT ONE DAY BE LEGISLATED FOR 
THE SOUTH.  THE MAJORITY OF SOUTHERNERS ARE NOT MUSLIMS 
AND, BY ALL INDICATIONS, DO NOT WANT TO BE GOVERNED BY 
ISLAMIC LAW.  THERE IS FEAR THAT THE GOS/NIF WILL 
MANIPULATE THE POPULAR COMMITTEES SO THEY WILL VOTE TO 
MAKE SHARIA LAW IN THE SOUTH.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
THE CIVIL SERVICE 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
11.  IN 1991, THE GOS REPORTEDLY RECONSTITUTED THE CIVIL 
SERVICE IN SUDAN.  PREVIOUSLY, NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN 
SUDAN EACH HAD THEIR OWN SEPARATE CIVIL SERVICE.  UNDER 
THE NEW LAWS, SUDAN HAS A SINGLE CIVIL SERVICE 
ADMINISTERED BY AUTHORITIES IN KHARTOUM.  GOS-APPOINTED 
\"SECRETARY GENERALS,\" ALL KNOWN NIF SUPPORTERS, DIRECTLY 
CONTROL THE CIVIL BUREAUCRACY IN EACH SOUTHERN STATE. 
THROUGH THE SECRETARY GENERALS, THE GOS/NIF CONTROLS 
RECRUITMENT OF NEW EMPLOYEES, JOB ASSIGNMENTS, AND 
PROMOTIONS.  THERE ARE REPORTS OF NON-MUSLIMS BEING 
SIDESTEPPED FOR PROMOTIONS, SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS BEING 
REPLACED BY INEXPERIENCED NIF SUPPORTERS, AND NUMEROUS 
INSTANCES OF FORCED RETIREMENT OF NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF 
SUPPORTERS. 
 
 
ISLAMIZATION/ARABIZATION OF EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
12.  IN ADDITION TO POLICIES DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN 
GOS/NIF CONTROL OVER SOUTHERN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, THE 
EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM IN THE SOUTH IS BEING ARABIZED AND 
ISLAMIZED.  REPORTEDLY, THE EQUATORIA STATE MINISTER OF 
EDUCATION RECENTLY DECREED THAT ISLAM BE A COMPULSORY 
SUBJECT IN ALL NURSERY SCHOOLS IN JUBA (NOTE: STUDENTS 
CANNOT ENTER PRIMARY SCHOOL UNLESS THEY HAVE COMPLETED 
NURSERY SCHOOL.  END NOTE).  IN JUBA, IT IS REPORTEDLY 
ALSO OFFICIAL POLICY THAT ALL SCHOOLS, INCLUDING THOSE 
RUN BY CHRISTIANS, MUST USE ARABIC AS THE LANGUAGE OF 
INSTRUCTION, AND ENGLISH MAY NOT BE INTRODUCED AS A 
SUBJECT UNTIL THE FIFTH GRADE. 
 
13.  IN MALAKAL, IN UPPER NILE STATE, THE ONLY SCHOOL 
STILL OPEN IS RUN BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  (NOTE: ALL 
OTHER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER AS GOS-ARMY BARRACKS. 
END NOTE).  REPORTEDLY, THE UPPER NILE MINISTER OF 
EDUCATION INFORMED THE SCHOOL IN JULY THAT ARABIC MUST BE 
THE SOLE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION. 
 
14.  GOS/NIF POLICY HAS LED TO A PROLIFERATION OF 
\"KHALWAS,\" I.E. ISLAMIC PRIMARY SCHOOLS, IN 
GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH.  STUDENTS NOT 
ATTENDING THESE SCHOOLS ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN THEY 
GO ON TO SECONDARY SCHOOL SINCE THEY LACK SKILLS IN 
ARABIC.  MOREOVER, PROPOSED NEW NATIONAL LEGISLATION 
WOULD MAKE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ISLAMIC AND ARABIC 
STUDIES AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL COMPULSORY FOR CONTINUING 
ON TO UNIVERSITY STUDIES. 
 
15. REPORTEDLY, NORTHERN SECURITY FORCES, PRESENT IN 
GOS-CONTROLLED CITIES SINCE LAST YEAR, SOMETIMES BRING 
NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN INTO THE KHALWAS AGAINST THE WISHES 
OF THEIR PARENTS.  TO WHOM OR WHAT INSTITUTIONS THESE 
FORCES ARE ACCOUNTABLE IS UNKNOWN.

16.  AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL, SOUTHERNERS ARE BEING 
CONVERTED TO ISLAM WITH FOOD AND MONEY.  THROUGHOUT 
GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH THE THREAT OF 
STARVATION IS VERY REAL.  OPERATING IN THESE AREAS ARE 
MUSLIM GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY THE DA\'WA, WHICH DISTRIBUTE 
FOOD AND OTHER AID.  THEY REPORTEDLY GIVE AID ONLY TO 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO DECLARE THEMSELVES TO BE MUSLIMS AND

MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE 
SIMILAR ASSISTANCE.  EVEN SOME DEVOUTLY CHRISTIAN PARENTS 
SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THESE SCHOOLS RATHER THAN DEPRIVE 
THEM OF FOOD.  THERE ARE ISOLATED REPORTS OF MONEY AND 
FOOD BEING OFFERED TO PREGNANT MOTHERS TO REGISTER THEIR 
NEWBORNS AS MUSLIMS AND OF PARENTS BEING PAID TO SEND 
THEIR CHILDREN TO KHALWAS. 
 
17.  COMMENT:  SOME BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE MAJORITY 
OF SOUTHERNERS CONVERTING TO ISLAM ARE \"RICE MUSLIMS, 
I.E. THAT THEY ARE DOING SO SOLELY BECAUSE THEY WANT

ARE HUNGRY THEY CAN GO TO THE KHALWA, TO THE MOSQUE, OR 
TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE DA\'WA, BUT THEY CANNOT EXPECT 
THE SAME PROVISIONS FROM THE NEEDY CHURCHES.  END COMMENT.

19.  IN THE NORTH, WHERE AS MUCH AS ONE-QUARTER OF THE 
POPULATION OF SOUTHERN SUDAN IS NOW DISPLACED (AS MANY AS 
2,500,000 PEOPLE), THE NEED FOR AID IS ACUTE.  MOST 
DISPLACED LIVE IN CAMPS OUTSIDE KHARTOUM, WITH MEAGER 
FACILITIES AND FEW RESOURCES.  AS IN THE SOUTH, ISLAMIC 
GROUPS, INCLUDING THE DA\'WA, DISPENSE RELIEF.  THIS 
RELIEF IS, ONCE AGAIN, RESERVED FOR MUSLIMS.  REPORTEDLY, 
REFUGEES SEEKING FOOD ARE ASKED TO GIVE THEIR NAMES.  IF 
THEY GIVE A MUSLIM NAME, THEY ARE GIVEN FOOD; IF THEY 
GIVE A CHRISTIAN NAME, THEY ARE NOT.  THESE REFUGEES HAVE 
THE OPTION, OF COURSE, OF CONVERTING, TAKING A MUSLIM

ACCORDINGLY MADE BECOMING A MUSLIM CONVENIENT, OFTEN 
PROFITABLE, AND SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL IN THE 
NORTH.  END COMMENT 
 
 
RECEPTIVITY TO ISLAM 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
24.  SOME SOUTHERNERS, WHETHER LIVING IN THE NORTH OR THE 
SOUTH, ARE REPORTEDLY MORE RECEPTIVE TO ISLAM THEN 
OTHERS, DEPENDING ON THEIR TRIBAL AND REGIONAL 
BACKGROUND.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE TRIBES IN THE UPPER NILE 
REGION (DINKA, SHILLUK, NUER) ARE REPORTEDLY LESS 
SUSCEPTIBLE TO ISLAMIZATION, GIVEN THEIR STRONG TRIBAL 
TRADITIONS AND STRUCTURES.  THEIR CULTURAL BACKGROUND, 
INCLUDING EXPERIENCE WITH SLAVERY AND COLONIALISM, ALSO 
MAKES THEM SUSPICIOUS OF OUTSIDE INFLUENCE.  TRIBES IN 
EQUATORIA ARE, APPARENTLY, NOT AT ALL OPEN TO ISLAM. 
EQUATORIA HAS NO BORDERS WITH THE NORTH AND THERE HAS 
BEEN HISTORICALLY LITTLE CONTACT OR ASSIMILATION.  MOST 
EQUATORIANS ARE FOLLOWERS OF TRADITIONAL RELIGIONS AND 
THEY MAINTAIN STRONG CULTURAL AND TRIBAL CUSTOMS. 
SLAVERY AND ITS ATTENDANT WARFARE HAVE MADE THEM HOSTILE 
TO OUTSIDERS, ESPECIALLY MUSLIMS. 
 
25.  IN CONTRAST, TRIBES LIVING ON THE BORDER WITH THE 
NORTH, DUE TO LONG-TERM INTERACTION WITH NORTHERNERS, ARE 
ALREADY SOMEWHAT ASSIMILATED AND THUS MAY BE MORE 
RECEPTIVE TO ISLAM.  THE TRIBES IN BAHR EL GHAZAL, IN 
SOUTH EASTERN SUDAN, HAVE HISTORICALLY INTERMARRIED AND 
MIXED WITH THE NORTHERNERS LIVING ON THEIR BORDERS.  THEY 
HAVE ASSIMILATED FOR CONVENIENCE AND ARE, AS A RESULT, 
MORE EASILY ISLAMIZED. 
 
 
HARASSMENT OF CHURCHES 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
26.  THE ACTIVITIES OF NON-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, 
INCLUDING SCHOOLS, HAVE BEEN SHARPLY CURTAILED BY THE 
GOS.  USING THE 1962 FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY ACT AS A 
TOOL, THE GOS FORBIDS THE BUILDING OF CHURCHES, CHURCH 
FACILITIES (INCLUDING SCHOOLS) AND THE ORGANIZATION OF 
CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES.  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS 
ORGANIZATIONS ARE MONITORED CLOSELY AND THE AMOUNT OF 
FUNDS THEY MAY EXPEND IS LIMITED BY GOS REGULATIONS.  IN 
THE GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH, NUMEROUS MOSQUES 
AND KHALWAS ARE BEING BUILT WHILE CHURCHES CONTINUE TO BE 
DENIED PERMITS TO BUILD OR REPAIR FACILITIES. 
 
27.  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL THROUGHOUT SUDAN ARE 
ROUTINELY HARASSED AND INTIMIDATED.  RECENTLY THE GOS 
INCARCERATED A CATHOLIC PRIEST AND THREE OF HIS STAFF IN 
DONGOLA, IN NORTHERN SUDAN, AND TRIED TO EXPEL FOUR OF 
MOTHER TERESA\'S MISSIONARIES.  SOME MAINTAIN THAT THIS IS 
EVIDENCE OF GOS/NIF INTENTION TO EVENTUALLY ERADICATE THE 
\"FOREIGN\" CHURCH PRESENCE FROM SUDAN, THUS LEAVING THE 
FIELD OPEN TO ISLAM. 
 
COMMENT AND CONCLUSION 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
28.  THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO DOUBT THAT THIS 
NIF-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT HOPES TO ISLAMIZE SOUTHERN SUDAN 
AND THOSE SOUTHERNERS LIVING IN THE NORTH.  GOS/NIF 
POLICIES SEEM DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THEIR SUPPORTERS 
WILL DOMINATE SOUTHERN POLITICS.  SUCH TACTICS FUEL FEARS 
THAT THE SOUTH WILL EVENTUALLY BE GOVERNED BY SHARIA. 
THE GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CHURCH, ALREADY 
UNFRIENDLY AND INHOSPITABLE, IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE 
OBSTRUCTIONIST.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE CHILDREN OF 
SOUTHERNERS, THE NEXT GENERATION OF SOUTHERN CITIZENS AND 
LEADERS, ARE BEING AGGRESSIVELY ISLAMIZED AND ARABIZED. 
THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SUDAN\'S FUTURE, IF THIS EFFORT IS 
SUCCESSFUL, WILL BE RADICAL AND TRANSFORMING AND WILL 
IMPACT ON THE STABILITY OF THE ENTIRE REGION.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT:  FROM A NUMBER OF CONTACTS 
WE HAVE HAD LATELY IN KHARTOUM\'S EVER ACTIVE 
POLITICAL CIRCLES, THERE IS PLAUSIBLE, BUT NOT YET 
CONCLUSIVE, HOPE THAT SUDAN\'S PRESIDENT MAY BE 
TRYING TO WIGGLE OUT SOMEWHAT FROM UNDER THE NIF 
SHADOW.  BASHIR\'S CONTINUING WEAKNESS, HOWEVER, IS 
THAT HIS CORE SUPPORT GROUP, THE ARMY, IS BEING 
REMOLDED DAY BY DAY BY THE NIF.  WHEN IT COMES TO 
POLITICAL ASSETS, BASHIR HAS HAD LITTLE TO RECOMMEND 
HIM BUT HIS UNIFORM.  THAT NOW MAY BE DEVALUED.  ANY 
INDEPENDENCE HE NOW MAY SHOW, PERHAPS USING THE NEW 
TNC, MAY WELL BE TOO LATE TO MATTER MUCH.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  A RECENT CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCM, POL&ECON 
COUNSELOR AND PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR FOR CIVILIAN 
AFFAIRS AHMED ZEIN AL ABDIEN, NEWLY NAMED TO THE 
TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL COUNCIL AND LONG A DUP PARTY 
STALWART, PARALLELED GENERALLY THE LINE WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING FROM OTHERS LATELY THAT BASHIR HAS SOME 
IDEAS OF HIS OWN AND IS NOT A TOTALLY KEPT MAN. 
THIS ARGUMENT ALSO SQUARES WITH THE COMMENTS BASHIR 
IS REPORTED TO HAVE MADE TO TGE PRESIDENT MELES AND 
PGE CHIEF ISAIAS DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO ASMARA. 
(REFTEL). 
 
4.  AL ABDEIN HAS BEEN ONE OF OUR FEW BRIDGES TO 
BASHIR AS US/SUDAN RELATIONS SOURED AND SANK.  HE IS 
A WESTERN ORIENTED LAWYER, AN OLD TIME POLITICIAN 
AND WHEELER-DEALER, AND AN ODD MAN IN BASHIR\'S 
ENTOURAGE.  WE TAKE HIM FOR A MESSAGE BEARER, AND A 
MAN TO REPORT HIS SOUNDINGS TO BASHIR.  AS FAR AS WE 
CAN TELL, HE IS NOT SOME NIF PLANT DOUBLING ON 
BASHIR BUT HAS HIS OWN AXES TO GRIND. 
 
5.  IN THE COURSE OF A LENGTHY CONVERSATION ON THE 
NEW PSEUDO-PARLIAMENT, THE TNC, AL ABDEIN SAID HE 
HAD RECEIVED BY DIRECT INTERVENTION WITH BASHIR, A 
FAIR SLICE OF THE SEATS FOR HIS OWN DUP PARTY 
CRONIES.  HE DESCRIBED THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF 
POLITICAL WHEELING AND DEALING, ASSURING US THAT, 
NIF OR NOT, SUDAN STILL HAD PLENTY OF ACTIVE 
POLITICKING GOING ON. 
 
6.  HE ALSO MADE THE POINT THAT THE TNC COULD, NOT 
WOULD, DEVELOP INTO A POLITICAL MECHANISM OF USE TO 
BASHIR DESPITE ITS RIGGED NIF MAJORITY OF 
APPOINTEES.  AL ABDEIN WENT TO SOME LENGTH TO PAINT 
BASHIR AS A MAN BURDENED WITH OFFICE, AN 
UNSOPHISTICATED BUT GENERALLY HONEST SOLDIER WHO WAS 
IN OVER HIS HEAD.  AL ABDEIN VERY STRONGLY 
SUGGESTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE TNC COULD TURN OUT TO 
BE A BASHIR HORSE TO THE NIF\'S TROY.  IF PROPERLY 
USED, THE TNC COULD SERVE TO BUILD POLITICAL POWER 
BACKING THE PRESIDENT.  HE WOULD NOT BE DRAWN OUT ON 
THE CHANCES FOR THIS COMING ABOUT. 
 
6.  MORE COMMENT: WE DOUBT THAT AN EMERGENCE OF 
BASHIR VIA THE TNC IS IN THE CARDS.  FROM ALL THAT 
WE HAVE SEEN OF IT AND ITS ORGANISATION, THE TNC 
MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLES AN OLD SOVIET STYLE PEOPLES 
CONGRESS, A PULPIT FOR THE OLIGARCHS TO USE TO 
RECEIVE PREPARED OVATIONS.  BUT AL ABDEIN\'S 
SUGGESTION THAT BASHIR MIGHT WANT TO USE THIS BODY 
AND HIS REPEATED ASSERTION THAT BASHIR IS NOT JUST A 
CIPHER, LEAD US TO THINK BASHIR MAY IN FACT HAVE 
SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE HIS NIF MENTORS HAVE LED 
HIM AND HIS COUNTRY. 
 
7.  EVEN IF TRUE, IT MAY WELL BE TOO LATE.  IN ANY 
EVENT, THE NIF ARE MAKING IT MORE AND MORE CLEAR 
THAT THEY PLAY ROUGH; ANY ERRANT SHOW OF INDEPENDENCE 
IN THE TNC IS LIKELY TO GET ITS AUTHOR SMACKED DOWN 
PROMPTLY.  IF BASHIR HOPES TO USE THE TNC TO BUILD 
HIMSELF A POLITICAL BASE, HE WILL HAVE TO MOVE WITH 
MORE POLITICAL SAVVY AND ENERGY THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN 
HIM SO FAR.

SUBJECT:  BIO UPDATE:  IBRAHIM SANUSSI 
 
1.  SECRET/NOFORN - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  FOLLOWING IS BASIC BIO DATA ON IBRAHIM SANUSSI: 
 
---BORN 1937 AL UBAYD, KORDOFAN. 
 
---1962 - BAKT AL RUDA TEACHER TRAINING INSTITUTE, 
DIPLOMA. 
 
---1970 - CAIRO UNIVERSITY, B. LAW. 
WAS A LEADING FIGURE IN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
MOVEMENT WITHIN THE CAIRO UNIVERSITY.  RESPONSIBLE 
FOR ESTABLISHING THE BRANCH OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERS AT 
THE UNIVERSITY.  WON CREDIT FOR NOT BEING OVERRUN BY 
THE NASIRITES AND THE COMMUNISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY. 
 
---1968 - EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF AL MERIEKH SPORTS 
CLUB IN OMDURMAN.  DID NOT PLAY A BIG ROLE BUT WAS A 
COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND OF FOUAD AL TOM WHO PUT HIS NAME 
IN THE LIST. 
 
---ARRESTED MARCH 1970 WITH THE REST OF THE LEADING 
MUSLIM BROTHERS.  RELEASED FROM PRISON TOWARDS THE 
END OF 1971 DURING THE AMNESTY GRANTED BY NIMEIRI 
AFTER HE WAS ELECTED AS PRESIDENT. 
 
---1973 - LEADER OF THE UNSUCCESSFUL SHE\'BAN 
UPRISING.  FLED TO LIBYA. 
 
---1973-1976 - JOINED THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE 
SUDANESE NATIONAL FRONT AND SPENT HIS TIME TRAVELLING 
BETWEEN LIBYA, BRITAIN, AND SUDAN PREPARING FOR THE 
SO CALLED LIBYAN INVASION. 
 
---IN 1976 CAME TO SUDAN LEADING A DIVISION OF 
FIGHTERS AND WAS IN CHARGE OF EASTERN OMDURMAN AREA 
INCLUDING THE RADIO STATION. 
 
---FLED THE COUNTRY AFTER HIDING FOR SIX MONTHS. 
SENTENCED TO DEATH IN ABSENTIA. 
 
---RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY AFTER THE RECONCILIATION 
IN 1977 AND WORKED IN PRIVATE BUSINESS.  MANAGED TO 
START A TRAVEL AND TOURISM AGENCY IN KHARTOUM. 
DURING THIS PERIOD HE WAS AN ORGANIZER IN THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE NIF. 
 
---ARRESTED BY NIMEIRI IN MARCH 1985.  RELEASED BY 
THE INTIFADA, APRIL 1985. 
 
---ELECTED FOR THE ASSEMBLY AS NIF (KORDOFAN 
GRADUATES CONSTITUENCY). 
 
---ARRESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF OMAR AL BASHIR ON 
JUNE 30, 1989 WHEN BASHIR OVERTHREW PRIME MINISTER 
SADIQ AL MAHDI.  RELEASED NOVEMBER, 1989. 
 
3.  AL SANUSSI IS A CLOSE ASSOCIATE AND FRIEND OF 
HASSAN AL TURABI AND IS CONSIDERED THE NUMBER THREE 
IN THE NIF BY MOST OBSERVERS.  HIS PERSONAL CLOSENESS 
TO TURABI IS EVIDENT.  HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHOM 
TURABI ASKED TO MEET HIM IMMEDIATELY UPON HIS ARRIVAL 
FROM AN OTTAWA HOSPITAL WHERE HE HAD BEEN UNDER CARE 
AFTER BEEN ATTACKED THERE.  SANUSSI ACTS AS TURABI\'S 
\"MIDDLEMAN\" IN ARRANGING MEETINGS, PASSING MESSAGES 
AND SEEING THAT INSTRUCTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT.  IN 
PUBLIC WHERE TURABI IS, SANUSSI IS USUALLY NEARBY. 
WITH THE ILLNESS OF TURABI, HE IS EVEN CLOSER 
PHYSICALLY THAN EVER BEFORE. 
 
4.  IN CONVERSATIONS SANUSSI IS SOFT SPOKEN AND 
ADHERES CLOSELY TO NIF DOCTRINE.  HIS SUPPORTERS, 
THERE ARE A FEW, SAY IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN ON 
THE FORMULATION OF NIF POLICY.  HIS DETRACTORS, THERE 
ARE MORE, SAY HIS ADHERENCE TO NIF POLICY IS LEARNED 
BY ROTE AND DEMONSTRATES THE SHALLOWNESS OF HIS 
MIND.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HE FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE 
DISCUSSING THE KORAN THAN DAY-TO-DAY POLITICS. 
 
5.  SURPRISINGLY, NONE BELIEVE THAT HE IS THE HEIR TO 
OR A SERIOUS CANDIDATE FOR HASSAN AL TURABI\'S 
POSITION IF TURABI LEAVES THE SCENE.  SANUSSI IS 
CONSIDERED THE TRUSTED AIDE AND THE IMPLEMENTER OF 
INSTRUCTIONS.  THE LONG YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE, 
YEARS IN EXILE AND HIDING, AND TIME SPENT IN PRISON 
CANNOT OUTWEIGH IN THE MIND OF SENIOR NIF MEMBERS THE 
FACT THAT HE IS NOT CONSIDERED AN INTELLECTUAL.  HE 
IS DERISIVELY KNOWN AS THE \"SCHOOL TEACHER.\"  SANUSSI 
IS NOT KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY IN PUBLIC SPEAKING BUT 
HE IS NOTED FOR HIS ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  WITHIN THE 
NIF HE IS NOT A MAN WHOM OTHERS RESPECT FOR HIS 
INTELLECTUAL ABILITY, IMAGINIATION, OR PUBLIC SPEAKING. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  CONVERSATIONS WITH IBRAHIM SANUSSI ARE 
NOT AS INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW AS HIS OPPONENTS 
INDICATE.  THE \"FACT\" THAT HE IS NOT PURE SUDANESE 
MIGHT BE A FACTOR, THOUGH SADIQ AL MAHDI, THE FORMER 
PRIME MINISTER AND HIS POLITICAL OPPONENT, SPEAKS 
APPROVINGLY OF HIS PHYSICAL COURAGE AND HONESTY BUT 
ALSO NOTES HE IS NOT A LEADER FOR THE FUTURE. 
 
7.  COMMENT CONTINUED:  IN A REGENCY, IF TURABI 
CANNOT FUNCTION POLITICALLY AS A RESULT OF HIS 
INJURIES, SANUSSI COULD BE A CANDIDATE FOR AN 
INTERREGNUM.  HISTORY IS REPLETE WITH SUCH MEN, I.E. 
JOHN PAUL XXIII.  SANUSSI MAY NOT BE A SUPERIOR 
INTELLECT BUT HE IS A DEVOUT MUSLIM, PHYSICALLY 
COURAGEOUS, WHO HAS PROVEN THAT HE IS COMMITTED TO 
THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT:  DEFINITELY NO RODNEY 
DANGERFIELD.  IBRAHIM SANUSSI IS CAPABLE OF GAINING 
RESPECT.

REF: A.)  STATE 2331119; B.) 89 KHARTOUM 11662 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  ALTHOUGH THE GOS REGULARLY 
REPEATS ITS PLEDGE TO CONDUCT DIRECT ELECTIONS FOR 
PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL NEED TO BE 
APPROVED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY (CURRENTLY AN 
APPOINTED BODY).  THIS INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT 
ONLY THOSE PERSONS ENJOYING THE GOS SEAL OF APPROVAL 
WILL BE ABLE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  REF A REPORTS THAT FINANCE MINISTER HAMDI 
TOLD DAS HOUDEK THERE WOULD SHORTLY BE \"MOVES TOWARD 
A DIRECT ELECTION\" OF A SUDANESE PRESIDENT.  DIRECT 
ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN A PUBLIC, AND 
REPEATED, GOS PROMISE SINCE THE GOS BEGAN TOUTING 
SUDAN\'S NEW POLITICAL SYSTEM IN 1989 (REF B).  (THE 
WORDS \"DIRECT ELECTIONS\" ARE ENCASED IN THE BIGGEST 
BLOCK IN THE COLORED LEAFLET, ENTITLED \"SUDAN\'S 
POLITICAL SYSTEM,\" WHICH CONTAINS A DIAGRAM OF THIS 
SYSTEM.  COPY OF LEAFLET WAS POUCHED TO AF/E) 
 
3.  (U)  IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, PRESIDENT BASHIR 
TOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT \"THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A 
NEW POLITICAL SYSTEM THROUGH ELECTIONS AND THE 
ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE 
REPUBLIC WILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS, 
BEFORE THE CELEBRATION OF THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE SUDANESE NATIONAL SALVATION REVOLUTION OF 30 
JULY.\"  OBVIOUSLY THIS TIMING, AS WITH MUCH ELSE 
HAVING TO DO WITH THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, APPEARS TO 
HAVE SLIPPED. 
 
4.  (U)  WE ALSO NOTE THAT (GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED) 
SUDAN NEWS AGENCY\'S \"WEEKLY REVIEW\" PUBLICATION 
(DATED JUNE 7, 1991) CONTAINED AN ARTICLE ON THE 
POLITICAL SYSTEM\'S STATUTES AND GENERAL PLAN.  THE 
ARTICLE STATES:  \"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC 
SHOULD BE SUDANESE, 35 YEARS OF AGE OR MORE AND 
SHOULD SATISFY THE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS NEEDED FOR 
THE JOB.  ANY ELIGIBLE CANDIDATE SHOULD BE 
RECOMMENDED BY AT LEAST 60 PER CENT OF THE MEMBERS 
OF THE BASIC CONGRESS HE BELONGS TO.  CANDIDATES FOR 
THE POST SHOULD HAVE THE APPROVAL OF AT LEAST 60 PER 
CENT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS. 
CANDIDACY SHOULD BE APPROVED BY THE NATIONAL 
CONGRESS.\" 
 
5.  (C)  APPROVAL OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BY THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, WHICH IS CURRENTLY AN APPOINTED 
ONE, WOULD THUS LIKLELY ASSURE THAT ONLY 
GOS-APPROVED PERSONS COULD RUN.  GOVERNMENT CONTROL 
OF PARTICIPANTS HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT FEATURE IN 
NEARLY EVERY MAJOR PUBLIC FORA ORGANIZED BY THIS 
REGIME (E.G. THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE CONFERENCE, THE 
POLITICAL SYSTEM CONFERENCE, THE TRANSITIONAL 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, AMONG OTHERS).  EVEN WHEN THERE 
WAS LESS INTERFERENCE WITH SELECTION OF 
PARTICIPANTS, SUCH AS IN THE NATIONAL FOUNDING 
CONFERENCE ON THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, THE GOVERNMENT 
EXERCISED FIRM CONTROL OVER THE OUTCOME OF THE 
SESSION.  THUS FAR, DESPITE FINANCE MINISTER HAMDI\'S 
OPTIMISM, THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE 
RCC/NIF HAS ANY INTENTION OF OFFERING GENUINE 
POLITICAL CHOICE TO ITS CITIZENS.

STATE LT. GEN. OMAR BASHIR REPORTEDLY PARDONED THOSE 
PERSONS WHO HAVE RECEIVED PRISON SENTENCES OF 
FIFTEEN YEARS OR LESS FOR STATE SECURITY CRIMES.  HE 
ALSO REDUCED PRISON TERMS FOR OTHERS AND PROMISED 
OBSERVANCE OF LEGAL RIGHTS IN FUTURE SECURITY 
CASES.  WHILE THE MOVE TO RELEASE PRISONERS IS A 
POSITIVE ONE, THE GOS HAS MADE SIMILAR HUMAN RIGHTS 
PLEDGES TO IMPROVE JUDICIAL PROCEDURES IN THE PAST, 
MOST NOTABLY TO AMBASSADOR CHEEK AND OTHER WESTERN 
DIPLOMATS IN MAY, 1991.  THESE PROMISES NEVER 
MATERIALIZED.  FOR NOW, IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO ADOPT 
A POSITION OF \"WAIT AND SEE.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  ON JULY 27, PRESIDENT OMAR BASHIR ISSUED A 
RESOLUTION RELEASING THOSE PERSONS SENTENCED FIFTEEN 
YEARS OR LESS FOR \"CRIMES AGAINST STATE SECURITY.\" 
BASHIR ALSO REDUCED LIFE IMPRISONMENT AND TWENTY 
YEARS\' IMPRISONMENT TERMS BY HALF.  THE FOLLOWING 
DAY, SUDAN\'S DIRECTOR OF PRISONS ANNOUNCED THAT 54 
PRISONERS HAD BEEN FREED, FROM A TOTAL OF 74 
INVOLVED IN COUP PLOTS.  THE RELEASEES, HE SAID, 
INCLUDED 27 PERSONS BEING HELD IN KHARTOUM STATE 
PRISONS (17 MILITARY PERSONNEL AND 11 CIVILIANS WERE 
RELEASED FROM KOBER PRISON IN KHARTOUM).  THE 
REMAINDER CAME FROM PENAL INSTITUTIONS IN OTHER 
STATES. 
 
3.  (U)  ON JULY 30, GOS-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPER, 
\"SUDAN AL-HADITH\" PUBLISHED THE NAMES OF THOSE FREED 
FROM THE VARIOUS PRISONS THROUGHOUT SUDAN (SHALLA, 
PORT SUDAN, SUAKIN, EL OBEID, ETC).  THE NUMBERS 
ALSO TOTAL 54.  (THE ARTICLE, HOWEVER, GIVES 
DIFFERENT FIGURES FOR KOBAR PRISON RELEASES--16 
ONLY.) 
 
4.  (U)  IN ADDITION TO LISTING SEVERAL AUGUST, 1991 
COUP PLOTTERS NOW FREED, SUCH AS COL. (RTD) MUSTAFA 
YOUSIF AL-TINAI, LT. COL. HAMADTU HUSSEIN IBRAHIM, 
AND GEN. (RTD) MOHAMMED OSMAN ABDALLAH HILAYFI, THE 
NEWS ARTICLE NAMES LONG-TIME DETAINEES, STANISLAUS 
KAW, HENRY TONG AND ABDEL GADIR ALI HAMID.  THESE 
MEN WERE, ALONG WITH DR. AHMED OSMAN SIRAJ, 
ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN THE SEPTEMBER, 1990 COUP 
PLOT.  \"SUDAN AL-HADITH\" ALSO REPORTS THAT THE LIFE 
SENTENCES FOR ABDEL RAHMAN ABDALLAH NUGUDALLAH, UMMA 
POLITICIAN, AND HASHIM AL KHEIR HASHIM, BOTH 
INVOLVED IN THE AUGUST, 1991 PLOT, WERE 
REDUCED--ALBEIT TO UNSPECIFIED TERMS.  (NOTE: 
DESPITE GOS ASSERTIONS THAT THE RELEASES HAVE 
ALREADY OCCURRED, WE HAVE INITIAL REPORTS THAT THOSE 
IMPRISONED IN DARFUR, THE EAST, AND OTHER OUT-LYING 
REGIONS HAVE YET TO BE FREED DUE TO PRACTICAL 
DELAYS.  THESE RELEASES ARE EXPECTED SOON.) 
 
5.  (C)  THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY THAT THE 
AMNESTY/REDUCTION OF SENTENCES WILL AFFECT THOSE 
PERSONS SUCH AS COL. NASR HASAN BASHIR NASR, 
RECENTLY SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR ESPIONAGE, AND SID 
AHMED AL-HUSSEIN, CURRENTLY BEING TRIED IN THE WEST 
FOR RECRUITING FOR THE SPLA.  SOME OBSERVERS HERE 
BELIEVE THAT COL. NASR\'S DEATH SENTENCE IS LIKELY TO 
BE COMMUTED TO A PRISON TERM.  THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED 
REPORTS THAT CHIEF JUSTICE LUTFI HAS ALREADY DONE 
THIS.  WHEN SID AHMED\'S CASE IS FINALLY RESOLVED, 
SOME BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER SENTENCE HE RECEIVES IS 
ALSO LIKELY TO BE REDUCED.  FOR NOW, HOWEVER, THIS 
REMAINS SPECULATION. 
 
6.  (U)  ON JULY 27, BASHIR ALSO DECLARED THAT, 
HENCEFORTH, ALL STATE SECURITY CASES WILL BE 
PUBLICLY TRIED AND DEFENDANTS WILL BE PERMITTED 
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS.  FURTHER, ANYONE BELIEVING THAT 
HIS RIGHTS HAVE BEEN ABUSED IS FREE TO SUBMIT HIS 
CASE TO THE COURTS.  ATTORNEY GENERAL DR. ABDALLAH 
IDRISS, PRESENT WITH BASHIR FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT, 
ADDED THAT THOSE CURRENTLY UNDER PREVENTIVE 
DETENTION AND THOSE PREVIOUSLY DETAINED MAY, IF THEY 
WISH, SUBMIT A GRIEVANCE, WITH SUPPORTING EVIDENCE, 
TO A JUDGE. 
 
7.  (C)  WHILE THESE RELEASES ARE A WELCOME 
DEVELOPMENT, WE RECALL THAT IN MAY 1991, SENIOR GOS 
OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THEN-POLITICAL ADVISOR, DR. 
GHAZI SALAH EDDIN, RCC MEMBER COL. KHALIFAH AND 
THEN-JUSTICE MINISTRY UNDERSECRETARY ALI YASIN, 
ASSURED AMBASSADOR CHEEK AND OTHER WESTERN 
AMBASSADORS THAT POLITICAL DETENTIONS WOULD BE 
SUBJECT TO STRICTER JUDICIAL SUPERVISION AND REVIEW 
(REF).  ALSO, POLITICAL DETAINEES WOULD HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO PRESS CHARGES OF ALLEGED PHYSICAL 
MISTREATMENT IN THE COURTS.  THE GOS REPRESENTATIVES 
PROUDLY PROCLAIMED THESE PLANNED HUMAN RIGHTS 
IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR, ADMITTEDLY, SKEPTICAL 
AUDIENCE. 
 
8.  (C)  FIFTEEN MONTHS LATER, HOWEVER, NONE OF 
THESE GOS PROMISES HAD MATERIALIZED.  IF ANYTHING, 
SECURITY PERSONNEL SEEMED TO ENJOY EVEN GREATER 
FREEDOM OF OPERATION WITH LESS OVERSIGHT.  WHAT DID 
CHANGE WAS THE PATTERN OF POLITICAL DETENTIONS: 
SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS USED GHOST HOUSES RATHER THAN 
PRISONS TO HOLD DETAINEES.  IN THESE SECRET GHOST 
HOUSES, SECURITY PERSONNEL ARE BETTER PLACED TO 
COMMIT ABUSES SUCH AS PHYSICAL MISTREATMENT/TORTURE 
AND BETTER ABLE TO ARREST PEOPLE AS THEY FEEL 
INCLINED.  ALSO, REPEATED ARRESTS OF THE SAME 
INDIVIDUAL WERE NOT UNCOMMON SINCE, UNLIKE IN FORMAL 
PRISONS, LEGAL RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT IN GHOST HOUSES. 
 
9.  (C)  WE MUST ALSO CAUTION THAT UNDER THIS 
REGIME, EVEN OPEN TRIALS MAY NOT GUARANTEE JUSTICE. 
FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECENT TRIAL OF COL. NASR--FOR 
ESPIONAGE--WAS AN OPEN ONE, BUT BY ALL ACCOUNTS, 
LITTLE DUE PROCESS WAS EVIDENT.  AT HIS TRIAL, COL. 
NASR REPORTEDLY DECLARED HE HAD BEEN BEATEN AND 
POINTED TO HIS ALLEGED TORTURER, PRESENT IN THE 
COURT ROOM.  NONETHELESS, HE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND 
SENTENCED TO DEATH. 
 
10.  (C)  THAT SAID, THE JULY 27 ANNOUNCEMENT CAME 
AS A SURPRISE HERE AND MANY OBSERVERS ARE 
SPECULATING AS TO THE REASONS BEHIND THE MOVE.  THE 
GOS HAS PUBLICLY STRESSED THAT THE DECISION CAME AS 
THE RESULT OF A PETITION FROM SUDAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
ORGANIZATION (A GOS ORGAN) AND ITS NEW ISLAMIC HUMAN 
RIGHTS ASSOCIATION.  NO ONE BELIEVES THIS.  SOME, 
CITING NIF SOURCES, SAY THAT HASSAN TURABI WAS SO 
IMPRESSED WITH HIS U.S. VISIT, THAT HE GAVE THE 
\"GREEN LIGHT\" TO THE RELEASES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE 
RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.  (COMMENT:  HIGHLY 
DOUBTFUL).  OTHERS CITE A RECENT ARAB LAWYERS GROUP 
MEETING IN CAIRO CONDEMNING SUDAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
ABUSES (SOMETIMES A PRECURSOR TO PRISONER RELEASES 
HERE). 
 
11.  (C)  WHATEVER THE REASON, IT WOULD BE NAIVE TO 
ASSUME THAT GOS HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES WILL IMPROVE 
FOR THE SUDANESE OPPOSITION OR FOR THOSE UNFORTUNATE 
INNOCENTS ROUNDED UP ON THE WHIM OF SECURITY 
AGENTS.  THE TREMENDOUS GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE GOS 
SAYS AND WHAT IT DOES IS A COMMON FEATURE OF LIFE 
HERE.  IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT EXPECT THE GOS TO 
SEPARATE ITSELF FROM THE ACTIONS OF ITS SECURITY 
ORGANIZATIONS.  DCM WAS RECENTLY TOLD BY MEMBERS OF 
THE NIF THAT DE FACTO HEAD OF SECURITY, DR. NAFI ALI 
NAFI, WILL REMAIN IN HIS JOB.  THE GOS IS GOING TO 
HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME IN PROVING IN THE WEEKS AND 
MONTHS AHEAD THAT--AS PROMINENTLY PLASTERED IN NEWS 
HEADLINES HERE--\"TOLERANCE IS PRACTISED\" IN SUDAN.

AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE NEED FOR MUSLIMS TO USE THE 
RELIGION AS A SHIELD AGAINST THE POWER OF THE WEST. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN A LONG SERMON BILLED AS A LECTURE IN THE 
QURAN UNIVERSITY\'S SEMINAR ON THE \"INTERNATIONALISM 
OF ISLAM,\" NIF LEADER DR. HASSAN AL TURABI TOLD AN 
OVERFLOW CROWD THAT ISLAM ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING IN 
LIFE AND IS A WIDELY SPREADING FAITH ALL OVER THE 
WORLD.  HE SAID MUSLIMS SHOULD PROSELYTIZE WITH 
THEIR RELIGION JUST AS OTHER RELIGIONS PRESENT 
THEMSELVES TO THE MUSLIM WORLD.  HE URGED MUSLIMS TO 
\"UNDERSTAND ISLAM PERFECTLY\" AND TO WORK FOR UNITY, 
JUST AS HE SAID THE WEST HAS DOING. 
 
4.  TAKING ON THE NEW WORLD ORDER, TURABI TOLD HIS 
AUDIENCE THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD BE MOTIVATED TO 
ESTABLISH AN \"ISLAMIC SYSTEM\" IN THEIR COUNTRIES 
BECAUSE OF ATTEMPTS BY THE WEST TO \"IMPOSE\" THE NEW 
WORLD ORDER, ITS OWN SYSTEM, ON THEM.  THE WEST, HE 
SAID, INTENDED TO EXTEND THE NEW WORLD ORDER 
UNIVERSALLY; \"NO COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT OR OPTION TO 
APPLY ANOTHER SYSTEM.\" 
 
5.  TURABI UNLOOSED A STREAM OF CRITICISM OF AMERICA 
AND WESTERN EUROPE.  CALLS FOR DEMOCRACY AND JUSTICE 
WERE HYPERCRITICAL, HE SAID; THE WEST DOES NOT IN 
FACT PRACTICE THESE.  INTERNATIONAL LAW, ITSELF A 
WESTERN CONCEPT, IS APPLIED BY THE WEST ONLY WHEN IT 
SERVES WESTERN ADVANTAGE. 
 
6.  TURABI GAVE FOR AN EXAMPLE THE CASE OF THE 
LIBYANS ACCUSED OF BOMBING PAN AM 103.  THE CASE 
SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF 
JUSTICE BUT THE WEST INSTEAD USED THE UNITED NATIONS 
SECURITY COUNCIL, WHICH IT \"DOMINATES,\" AS ITS TOOL 
TO PRESS LIBYA.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL, HE 
ELABORATED, HAD \"A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE ENGLAND\" 
\"PRIVILEGED\" TO HAVE A PERMANENT SEAT WHILE INDIA 
AND NIGERIA WITH LARGER POPULATIONS DID NOT. 
 
7.  AS HE HAS OFTEN DONE BEFORE, TURABI HEAPED SCORN 
UPON LEADERS OF MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHO \"SURRENDER\" TO 
THE WEST AND \"ABANDON ISLAMIC GUIDANCE.\"  TURABI 
SAID THESE MEN (HE NAMED NO NAMES) FED FALSE 
INFORMATION TO THE WEST TO \"DISFIGURE\" ALL ISLAMIC 
MOVEMENTS.  THESE LEADERS, HE SAID, CARE ONLY FOR 
POWER AND POSITION, BOTH OF WHICH THEY WILL LOSE 
WHEN ISLAMIC RULE COMES TO THEIR COUNTRIES. 
 
8.  CALLING ON THE SUDANESE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES IN 
ACCORD WITH ISLAM SO AS TO SERVE AS MODELS FOR 
MUSLIM PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, TURABI CONCLUDED BY 
WARNING ALL MUSLIM NATIONS TO APPLY ISLAM AS A 
SYSTEM TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST THE NEW WORLD 
ORDER AND THE UNITY OF THE WEST. 
 
9.  DOUBTLESS TAKING HIS CUE FROM DR. TURABI, 
SUDAN\'S PRESIDENT, LT. GEM. OMAR HASSAN AL BASHIR IN 
A SERIES OF SPEECHES FOLLOWING THE 
\"INTERNATIONALISM\" SEMINAR, SOUNDED CONVERGENT 
THEMES.  TO A MASS RALLY OF STUDENTS ON THE 15TH, AL 
BASHIR SAID SUDAN\'S REVOLUTION SOUGHT TO \"UNLEASH 
THE ENERGIES OF THE SUDANESE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY 
WILL BE A SOURCE OF VIGOR AND POWER TO ALL THE 
OPPRESSED PEOPLES ON THE EARTH.\"  THE SUDANESE, 
ASSERTED AL BASHIR, ARE AN EXAMPLE TO BE FOLLOWED BY 
THE OPPRESSED COUNTRIES AND \"A NATION OF MESSAGE.\" 
 
10.  ON THE 20TH, TO A QURAN FESTIVAL, AL BASHIR 
CALLED FOR \"STRENGTHENING TIES BETWEEN ISLAMIC 
PEOPLES SO AS TO SPOIL THE INTRIGUES PLANNED AGAINST 
THE ISLAMIC PEOPLES BY THE POWERS OF AGGRESSION AND 
ATHEISM.\"  CITING THE WEST\'S INDIFFERENCE TO THE 
SUFFERING OF MUSLIMS IN BOSNIA AND HERCEGOVINA, 
IRAQ, LIBYA AND SOMALIA, HE SAID THESE COUNTRIES\' 
SITUATIONS REVEAL \"INTRIGUES AGAINST ISLAM AND THE 
MUSLIMS,\" ALL BEING \"WITNESSED BY THE NEW WORLD 
ORDER.\" 
 
11.  COMMENT: TURABI\'S THEMES, AND THEIR FAITHFUL 
ECHO IN THE PRESIDENT\'S REMARKS, ARE NOT NEW.  NOR 
IS TURABI\'S PREFERRED ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL IMAM. 
HIS SERMONISING STYLE SUITS THOSE SUDANESE, WHO, 
LIKE SOME OTHER FUNDAMENTALISTS, ENJOY A ROUSING 
PREACHER GOING AFTER SIN AND THE WORKS OF THE 
DEVIL.  AL BASHIR, NO ORIGINAL THINKER, BUT A USEFUL 
SIDE-MAN FOR AMPLIFYING A THEME, ADDS HIS PART.  BUT 
TURABI\'S MESSAGE IS NOT BENIGN AND THE DEVIL HE IS 
ATTACKING IS US.

SUBJECT: SUDAN: \'92 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 338430 
 
1. FOLLOWING IRANIAN PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI\'S 
VISIT TO KHARTOUM IN DECEMBER, 1991, THE 
GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN HAS ATTEMPTED TO INCREASE 
ITS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TIES WITH IRAN, A 
PROMINENT MEMBER OF THE USG LIST OF STATE 
SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. 
 
-  CONCURRENTLY, THE INVASIVE AND DOMINEERING 
ROLE OF THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT OVER THE 
SUDANESE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY IN GENERAL HAS 
PRODUCED AN ENVIRONMENT WITHIN SUDAN THAT IS 
INCREASINGLY TOLERANT OF, AND ATTRACTIVE TO, 
BOTH RADICAL, REJECTIONIST ARABS AND 
TERRORISTS. 
 
-  THE ABSENCE OF VISA REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY 
ETHNIC ARAB DESIRING ENTRY INTO SUDAN HAS 
RESULTED IN THE PRESENCE OF A MYRIAD COLLECTION 
OF FUNDAMENTALIST ZEALOTS AND TERRORIST 
ORGANISATION AFFILIATES THAT CHALLENGE 
MONITORING EFFORTS. 
 
2  THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT DID NOT EXTRADITE OR 
REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS IN 1992. 
 
3.  THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN UNDERTOOK NO 
COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS IN 1992. 
 
4. IN ADDITION TO ITS CLOSER RELATIONS WITH 
IRAN, THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN MAINTAINED STRONG 
RELATIONS WITH OTHER USG DEFINED SPONSORS OF 
STATE TERRORISM SUCH AS IRAQ AND LIBYA. 
CONSISTENT WITH ITS SUPPORT FOR IRAQ DURING THE 
GULF WAR, SUDAN HAS CONTINUED ITS ACTIVE SUPPORT 
OF IRAQ IN THAT COUNTRY\'S CURRENT DEFIANCE OF 
UNITED NATIONS MEASURES AND THE POLICIES OF THE 
COALITION POWERS. 
 
5.  DURING 1992, SUDAN\'S SELF-ISOLATION BOTH 
FROM THE WESTERN COUNTRIES AND FROM ITS MODERATE 
ARAB NEIGHBORS HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY.  SAUDI 
ARABIA, ALGERIA AND EGYPT HAVE EXPERIENCED 
STRAINS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE KHARTOUM 
GOVERNMENT.  FOLLOWING NUMEROUS ACCUSATIONS OF 
SUDANESE INVOLVMENT IN TUNISIAN INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS, THE SUDANESE EMBASSY IN TUNIS, AND THE 
TUNISIAN EMBASSY IN KHARTOUM, WERE CLOSED. 
 
6. THE PALESTINIAN LIBERATION ORGANISATION HAS 
MAINTAINED A PROMINENT AND OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED 
PRESENCE IN SUDAN SINCE ITS 1982 REMOVAL FROM 
BEIRUT.  THIS HAS IN TURN FOSTERED THE PRESENCE 
IN SUDAN OF NUMEROUS SPLINTER GROUPS AND 
FACTIONS OF THIS ORGANISATION.  ADDITIONALLY, 
PLO CHAIRMAN YASSIR ARAFAT TRAVELLED TO SUDAN 
SEVERAL TIMES DURING 1992.  THERE ARE REPORTS OF 
MEMBERS OF OTHER TERRORIST GROUP ENJOYING 
SAFEHAVEN IN SUDAN AS WELL. 
 
7.  ALTHOUGH THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT HAS 
COMPLIED IN GENERAL WITH THE U.N. SECURITY 
COUNCIL\'S MANDATORY SANCTIONS RESOLUTIONS ON 
LIBYA, THERE HAS BEEN NO INDICATION OF ANY 
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF THE OFFICIAL LIBYAN 
PRESENCE IN SUDAN.

1.  IN WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED MEDIA HERE 
TERM \"AN EXPRESSION OF ANXIETY,\" SUDAN\'S HEAD OF 
STATE, LT. GEM. OMAR AL BASHIR, IN HIS DECEMBER 
2ND PRESS CONFERENCE, SAID HE HAS WORRIED ABOUT 
\"THE SUDDEN ESCALATION OF THE CONFLICT IN 
SOMALIA AND THE U.N. DECISION TO SEND FORTY 
THOUSAND (SIC) U.S. FORCES TO THAT SMALL 
COUNTRY.\" 
 
2.  BASHIR EMPHASIZED THAT \"SUCH A LARGE-SCALE 
FOREIGN INTERVENTION AT THE SIZE FIXED BY THE 
U.N. WILL AGGRAVATE THE PROBLEM...\"  HE ALSO 
COMPLAINED THAT THE INTERVENTION IGNORES THE 
\"EFFORTS WHICH ARE BEING EXERTED BY THE 
COUNTRIES OF THE HORN OF AFRICA...\" WHICH HAD 
\"RECEIVED POSITIVE RESPONSES FROM ALL THE 
CONFLICTING FACTIONS.\" 
 
3.  BASHIR ASSERTED THAT THE EFFORTS OF THE 
\"COUNTRIES IN THE AREA COULD RESULT IN THE 
SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM.\"  ACCORDING TO HIM, 
\"SOMALIA HAS RECENTLY WITNESSED RELATIVE 
STABILITY DUE TO THE PEACE EFFORTS CARRIED OUT 
BY THE COUNTRIES OF THE HORN OF AFRICA.\"  HE 
CALLED FOR AVOIDING ESCALATION. 
 
4.  SUMMING UP, BASHIR SAID; \"SUDAN VIEWED THE 
DISPATCH OF AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO 
SOMALIA...AS UNJUSTIFIED AND PART OF AN 
INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACY AIMING FOR A MILITARY 
PRESENCE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA REGION, WHICH 
OVERLOOKS THE MOST IMPORTANT WATERWAY IN THE 
WORLD...\" 
 
5.  IN NAIROBI, FOR TALKS ON CONTINUING SUDAN\'S 
STALLED PEACE PROCESS, DELEGATION CHIEF AND 
MAJOR ISLAMIC FRONT FIGURE DR. ALI AL HAJ TOLD 
THE PRESS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF U.S. FORCES INTO 
SOMALIA \"WOULD CAUSE INTERNATIONAL ANARCHY, 
NON-RESPECT OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND A NEW 
FORM OF IMPERIALISM.\" 
 
6.  COMMENT:  WE EXPECT SUDANESE ANXIETIES TO 
RISE EVEN MORE AS THE INTERVENTION UNFOLDS.  THE 
INTERPLAY OF STEADILY WORSENING RELATIONS WITH 
THE U.S. AND THE OTHER INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES 
(AS WELL AS WITH SOME OF SUDAN\'S NEIGHBORS) AND 
THE U.N\'S CONDEMNATION OF SUDAN\'S HUMAN RIGHTS 
ABUSES IS PRODUCING A CUMULATIVE ISOLATING 
EFFECT ON THIS HARD-LINE REGIME.  THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER\'S VERY OUT OF STEP COMMENTS TO 
AMBASSADOR (REFTEL C) SHOW ALSO THE DISARRAY THE 
ACTION IS CAUSING INSIDE THE FRACTIOUS GOS. 
 
7.  AS REFTEL A REPORTS, THE SUDANESE PUBLIC IS 
REACTING, AT TIMES QUITE ILLOGICALLY, TO WHAT 
THEY SEE AS A CHANGE IN THE POLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT IN THIS REGION.  REFTEL B GIVING 
MORE PRESS REACTION, RECORDS \"THE MODERN SUDAN\" 
FRETTING THAT; \"THE INFLUX OF SUCH A HUGE NUMBER 
OF TROOPS WILL...EXPAND INTO AN ORGANIZED 
INVASION OF THE WHOLE REGION.\" 
 
8.  THE INCREASING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON THE 
GOS, THE INTRODUCTION OF U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN 
FORCES INTO THE HORN, WHATEVER THEIR MISSION AND 
ITS STATED LIMITATIONS, AND THE CONTINUED WAVES 
OF RUMOR AND SUPPOSITION ABOUT GOVERNMENTAL 
SHIFTS HERE ARE TAKING A TOLL.  THE STREET RATE 
ON U.S. DOLLARS HAS MOVED UP QUICKLY THIS WEEK 
TO ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SUDANESE POUNDS FROM ONE 
FORTY-EIGHT AND DOLLARS ARE NOW VERY SCARCE.  WE 
EXPECT MORE OF THIS TO COME.

1.  ACCORDING TO THE JUNE 9 SUDANESE PRESS, NATIONAL 
ISLAMIC FRONT LEADER AND DE FACTO RULER OF SUDAN, 
HASAN AL TURABI TOLD STUDENTS ATTENDING A CONFERENCE 
OF SUDAN\'S STUDENT UNIONS, THAT THE UNITY OF SUDAN 
AND THE CREATION OF AN ISLAMIC STATE COULD NOT BE 
ACHIEVED EXCEPT THROUGH A JIHAD.  ACCORDING TO 
TURABI, THE MAIN DANGER FACING ISLAM IS THE WESTERN 
COALITION WHICH OPPOSES IT.  HE ASSERTED, HOWEVER, 
THAT THE WEAPON OF JIHAD TERRIFIES THE WEST BECAUSE 
OF THE WEAKNESS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION.  THE 
CHALLENGES TO ISLAM MUST BE CONFRONTED STRONGLY HE 
ADDED.  THIS MESSAGE APPLIED NOT JUST TO SUDAN BUT TO 
ALL MUSLIMS WHEREVER THEY RESIDE. 
 
2.  COMMENT: THIS IS VINTAGE TURABI AND HELPS TO

SUDANESE APPROACH PEACE TALKS WITH THIS GOVERNMENT. 
AT THE SAME TIME THE GOS IS OFFERING SOUTHERNERS 
FEDERALISM AND PERHAPS EVEN AUTONOMY, THE REAL POWER

1. SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY. ACCORDING TO A NORMALLY RELIABLE CONTACT 
WHO RECENTLY VISITED RELATIVES IN THE AREA, THE 
IRANIAN AGRICULTURAL PROJECT LOCATED NEAR EL GEITI 
NORTH OF KHARTOUM IS BASICALLY INACTIVE.  THE 
IRANIANS REPORTEDLY MAINTAIN, HOWEVER, A SECOND, 
LARGE FACILITY A FEW KILOMETERS FROM THIS 
AGRICULTURAL PROJECT.  THE AREA IS OFF LIMITS TO 
LOCAL TOWNSPEOPLE, AND MOST MOVEMENT TO AND FROM THE 
FACILITY OCCURS AT NIGHT.  THE LOCAL POPULATION DOES 
NOT KNOW WHAT PURPOSE THIS SECOND IRANIAN FACILITY 
SERVES. END SUMMARY. 
 
3. THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT RUNS AN AGRICULTURAL 
PROJECT LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 55 KILOMETERS NORTH OF 
KHARTOUM, AND SOME FIVE KILOMETERS NORTH OF THE TOWN 
OF EL GEITI, ON THE PAVED ROAD LEADING FROM KHARTOUM 
TO SHENDI.  THE PROJECT COMPOUND ABUTS THE LEFT 
(WEST) SIDE OF THE ROAD WHEN ONE IS TRAVELING FROM EL 
GEITI TO SHENDI.  THE FENCED COMPOUND CONSISTS OF A 
FEW SINGLE-STORY OFFICE AND/OR STORAGE BUILDINGS AND 
ONE OR TWO LARGE STORAGE HANGARS, UNDER WHICH ARE 
PARKED HALF A DOZEN LARGE PIECES OF AGRICULTURAL 
MACHINERY, WHICH FROM A DISTANCE APPEAR TO BE 
HARVESTERS.  THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT IS 
TO ASSIST AREA FARMERS. 
 
4. NEAR THE COMPOUND ARE TWO SMALL VILLAGES, WAD 
RAMLI AND WAD WISI (PHONETIC).  ACCORDING TO A GOOD 
EMBASSY CONTACT WHO WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE AREA 
AND WHO RECENTLY VISITED RELATIVES THERE, THE IRANIAN 
PROJECT IS BASICALLY INACTIVE AND PROVIDES NEXT TO NO 
ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL FARMERS.  ON OCCASION IRANIAN 
PROJECT STAFF RENT THEIR VEHICLES TO LOCAL FARMERS TO 
TRANSPORT FARM PRODUCE, BUT AT THE GOING COMMERICAL 
RATE. 
 
5. ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL TOWNSPEOPLE, THE LARGER 
MACHINERY RARELY, IF EVER, MOVES.  THE WHOLE AREA IS 
BASICALLY SEMI-DESERT OR DESERT, WITH, HOWEVER, A 
THIN BAND OF FERTILE AND WELL-WATERED FIELDS ALONG 
THE BANKS OF THE NILE, WHICH FLOWS IN A SOUTH-NORTH 
DIRECTION PARALLEL TO THE ROAD, FIVE TO TEN 
KILOMETERS WEST OF THE PAVEMENT. 
 
6. OUR SOURCE REPORTS THAT THERE IS A SECOND IRANIAN 
COMPOUND, FACING THE AGRICULTURAL PROJECT, BUT 
LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 3 KILOMETERS EAST OF IT, ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE KHARTOUM/SHENDI ROAD AND THE NEARBY 
RAILROAD LINE.  UNLIKE THE AGRICULTURAL PROJECT, THIS 
SECOND IRANIAN COMPOUND IS NOT AS EASILY VISIBLE FROM 
THE ROAD. 
 
7. OUR SOURCE STATED THAT THIS SECOND COMPOUND, WHICH 
IS ALSO FENCED, IS VERY LARGE.  (HE WAS NOT, HOWEVER, 
MORE SPECIFIC).  IT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF TEMPORARY- 
TYPE STRUCTURES SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY LARGER IN SIZE TO 
MOBILE HOMES.  THE AREA IS OFF-LIMITS TO THE LOCAL 
TOWNPEOPLE.  OUR SOURCE SAID HE HAD SPOKEN TO LOCAL 
HERDERS WHO COMPLAINED THEY COULD NO LONGER TAKE 
THEIR FLOCKS TO THE SITE, A TRADITIONAL GRAZING AREA. 
 
8. ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, THE TOWNSPEOPLE DO NOT 
KNOW WHAT PURPOSE THE SECOND COMPOUND SERVES.  MOST 
MOVEMENT TO AND FROM THE FACILITY IS AT NIGHT.  THE 
IRANIAN STAFF WORKING (AND PRESUMABLY LIVING) THERE 
RARELY VISIT THE NEAR-BY VILLAGES AND HAVE NEXT TO NO 
CONTACT WITH THE LOCAL POPULATION.  REPORTEDLY, ON A 
FEW OCCASIONS NOCTURNAL VEHICLE MOVEMENT TO AND FROM 
THE SITE HAS BEEN HEAVY. 
 
9. COMMENT. AS PART OF ITS PROGRAM OF COOPERATION 
WITH SUDAN, THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IS ASSISTING SUDAN 
WITH ROAD-BUILDING AND HAS DESPATCHED IRANIAN 
CONSTRUCTION CREWS AND ROAD-BUILDING EQUIPMENT TO 
SUDAN.  THE LATTER, HOWEVER, ARE ENGAGED IN THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE KOSTI-MALAKAL ROAD (PEACE ROAD), 
AN IRANIAN AID PROJECT SOUTH OF KHARTOUM. 
 
10. THE KHARTOUM-SHENDI ROAD IS PART OF A SEPARATE 
ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROJECT WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY LINK 
KHARTOUM TO ATBARA.  THE KHARTOUM-SHENDI PORTION HAS 
ALREADY BEEN PAVED, AND WORK IS BEGINNING ON THE 
SHENDI-ATBARA SECTION.  CONSTRUCTION IS BEING CARRIED 
OUT BY THE \"EL HIJRA\" CONSTRUCTION COMPANY BELONGING 
TO SAUDI BUSINESSMAN (AND BACKER OF RADICAL CAUSES) 
OSAMA BIN LADEN.  THE COMPANY HAS CONSTRUCTION AND 
MAINTENANCE CAMPS AT REGULAR INTERVALS ALONG THE 
ROAD.  AN EMBASSY OFFICER, SPEAKING TO MEMBERS OF ONE 
OF THE COMPANY\'S ROAD CREWS SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, NOTED 
THAT THEY WERE NON-SUDANESE--POSSIBLY PALESTINIAN. 
 
11. IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THE PERSONNEL OUR SOURCE 
(A FORMER TOP-RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL UNDER AN 
EARLIER REGIME, WHO HAS SO FAR PROVEN TO BE RELIABLE) 
BELONG TO THE BIN LADEN CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.  OUR 
SOURCE, HOWEVER, WAS CATEGORICAL THAT THE PERSONNEL 
HE HAS DESCRIBING WERE IRANIAN.  HE FURTHER DESCRIBED 
BOTH THEIR BEHAVIOR AND THE SECURITY SURROUNDING 
THEIR SITE AS UNUSUAL.  WE CANNOT ASCERTAIN PRECISELY 
WHO THEY ARE OR WHAT THEY ARE DOING, BUT PASS ON THE 
INFORMATION IN THE EVENT OTHERS MAY FIND IT OF 
INTEREST.

REF: A) DUSHANBE 2573 (NOTAL); B) NOUAKCHOTT 3541 
 
 
1. SECRET/NOFORN ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY. THE GOS/NIF IS INDOCTRINATING ITS PEOPLE 
IN ITS RADICAL, ANTI-WESTERN VERSION OF ISLAM.  IT 
PROMOTES ITS IDEOLOGY ABROAD BY TRAINING AND HELPING 
FOREIGN ISLAMISTS AND BY PROSELYTIZING THROUGH 
ISLAMIST NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOS/NIP 
ALSO SEEKS TO EXPORT POLITICAL CHANGE BY FORCE, AS 
EVIDENCED BY ITS EFFORTS TO DESTABILIZE ERITREA AND 
UGANDA.  MOREOVER, THE GOS/NIF SUPPORTS MOST MAJOR 
MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
3. THE IMPORT OF THESE ACTIVITIES SHOULD NOT BE 
OVERSTATED: TERRORISTS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE, 
STABILITY IN THE HORN OF AFRICA WILL REMAIN 
PRECARIOUS, AND RADICAL ISLAMISTS WORLDWIDE WILL 
CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE U.S. WITH OR WITHOUT SUDAN\'S 
HELP.  GOS/NIF BEHAVIOR, HOWEVER, MAKES THINGS WORSE 
ON ALL THREE SCORES.  ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN 
THE WORLD, SUDAN NONETHELESS SUCCEEDS IN PROJECTING 
INFLUENCE ABROAD; UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS UNIFORMLY 
NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF U.S. VALUES AND INTERESTS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
4. SINCE THE GOS/NIF SEIZED POWER IN 1989 IT HAS 
BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THIS OSTENSIBLY 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT IS A TOOL OF SUDAN\'S NATIONAL 
ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF).  SPEAKING TO U.S. OFFICIALS, 
SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE GOS AND THE NIF THAT CONTROLS 
IT OFTEN PORTRAY THEMSELVES AS \"MODERATE\" ISLAMISTS. 
THEY SAY THEY BEAR NO FUNDAMENTAL HOSTILITY TO THE 
WEST OR TO THE U.S., AND BLAME STRAINED U.S- SUDANESE 
RELATIONS ON AN ALLEGED U.S. BIAS AGAINST ISLAM. 
 
----------------------------------- 
GOS/NIF SEEKS TO INDOCTRINATE SUDAN 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. THEIR PROTESTATIONS, HOWEVER, ARE BELIED BY THE 
EXTREMIST MESSAGE THE REGIME PROPOUNDS TO THE 
SUDANESE.  THE UBIQUITOUS GOS/NIF PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN 
PROMOTES A MILITANT AND INTOLERANT VERSION OF ISLAM. 
ALTHOUGH SUDANESE BELONG TO A VARIETY OF CREEDS, 
OFFICIAL RHETORIC TREATS ISLAM AS THE DE FACTO STATE 
RELIGION AND ADVOCATES INFUSING ALL OF SOCIETY WITH 
ITS VALUES.  OFFICIAL PROPAGANDA EXTOLS THE WAR IN 
THE SOUTH AS A \"JIHAD\" (HOLY WAR) AGAINST UNBELIEVERS. 
 
6. NOWHERE, PERHAPS, IS THE EXTREMISM OF GOS/NIF 
ISLAMIST PROPAGANDA MORE APPARENT THAN IN ITS 
TREATMENT OF THE WEST.  GOS/NIP OFFICIALS ROUTINELY 
DEPICT THE WEST AS UNGODLY, DECADENT, AND HOSTILE. 
THEY SINGLE OUT THE U.S. FOR SPECIAL ATTACK, 
PORTRAYING IT AS A MALEVOLENT POWER BENT ON COMBATING 
ISLAM.  THIS DRUMBEAT IS RELENTLESS AND PERVASIVE. 
 
7. IT IS A STAPLE OF THE GOS-CONTROLLED MEDIA, WHICH 
ARE FULL OF COMMENTARIES, ARTICLES, EDITORIALS, AND 
SONGS LAMBASTING THE U.S.  A POPULAR VIDEO THE T.V. 
IS RUNNING SUMS UP THE MESSAGE, PORTRAYING THE U.S. 
AS THE FOE.  IMAGES OF U.S. FORCES ARE CONTRASTED 
WITH SHOTS OF THE GOS\'S ISLAMIC POPULAR DEFENCE 
FORCES (PDF) MARCHING PROUDLY BY.  OTHER IMAGES SHOW 
LIGHTNING SYMBOLICALLY STRIKING THE U.S. STATUE OF 
LIBERTY.  THE LYRICS AMPLIFY THE THEME OF THE U.S. AS 
THE ENEMY.  SUCH PROPAGANDA IS DAILY MEDIA FARE. 
 
8. THE GOS/NIP\'S RADICAL ISLAMIST MESSAGE, WITH ITS 
STRONG ANTI-U.S. COMPONENT, IS CONVEYED IN OTHER WAYS 
AS WELL.  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUDANESE A YEAR ABSORB 
HEAVY DOSES OF IT IN POPULAR DEFENSE FORCES\' 
TRAINING.  (PDF SONGS OFTEN DESCRIBE HOW THE PDF WILL 
DEFEAT THE AMERICANS.)  PRO-NIP TEACHERS RELAY THE 
MESSAGE IN SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES, AND 
GOS-APPOINTED PREACHERS ECHO THE THEMES IN SERMONS AT 
MOSQUES. 
 
9. JUST HOW MUCH IMPACT THIS PROPAGANDA HAS IS HARD 
TO TELL.  MANY SUDANESE DISMISS IT OUT OF HAND. 
OTHERS, HOWEVER, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG AND LESS 
EDUCATED, HEED IT MORE.  MANY HAVE NO OTHER SOURCE OF 
INFORMATION ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD.  MOROEVER, SUDANESE 
MUSLIMS ARE OFTEN DEEPLY RELIGIOUS.  BY PORTRAYING 
ISLAM AS UNDER U.S. ASSAULT, GOS/NIP PROPAGANDA 
ELICITS AMONG SOME AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE.  WE THINK 
THIS PROPAGANDA IS CONVINCING A SEGMENT OF OPINION 
THAT ISLAM IS THREATENED AND THAT THE US. IS THE FOE. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
AND TRIES TO PROMOTE RADICALISM WORLDWIDE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
10. THE GOS/NIP IS NOT CONTENT, HOWEVER, WITH PUSHING 
RADICAL ISLAM AT HOME.  IT PROMOTES ITS WORLDVIEW 
ABROAD AS WELL.  A SPECIAL UNIVERSITY IN KHARTOUM, 
AFRICA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY (AIU), SCHOOLS 
THOUSANDS OF FOREIGNERS, MOSTLY AFRICANS, IN THE NIP 
VERSION OF ISLAM.  ALMOST ALL ARE ON SCHOLARSHIPS. 
FOREIGNERS ALSO HAVE SCHOLARSHIPS TO OTHER SUDANESE 
UNIVERSITIES WHERE THE TEACHING LIKEWISE LEANS 
HEAVILY TOWARD RADICAL ISLAM, WITH A STRONG 
ANTI-WESTERN COMPONENT. 
 
11. UPON GRADUATING, THESE STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO 
GO HOME TO IMPART WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED. 
ADMITTEDLY, JUST AS MOSCOW\'S PATRICE LUMUMBA 
UNIVERSITY PRODUCED ITS SHARE OF ANTI-COMMUNISTS, NOT 
ALL FOREIGN STUDENTS ARE IMPRESSED WITH WHAT THEY SEE 
AND HEAR IN SUDAN.  STILL, A NUMBER LEAVE CONVINCED. 
 
12. THE GOS/NIF FURTHER PROMOTES RADICAL ISLAM 
THROUGH EXTENSIVE TIES TO LIKE-MINDED ISLAMISTS 
WORLDWIDE.  TWO INSTRUMENTS TO THIS END ARE THE 
POPULAR ARAB ISLAMIC CONFERENCE (PAIC), HEADED BY NIF 
SECRETARY GENERAL HASSAN TURABI, AND THE COUNCIL FOR 
INTERNATIONAL PEOPLES\' FRIENDSHIP (CIPF), HEADED BY A 
TURABI PROTEGE. 
 
13. THE PAIC AND THE CIPF MAINTAIN LINKS WITH GROUPS 
AS DISPARATE AS LOUIS FARRAKHAN\'S NATION OF ISLAM AND 
ISLAMIST GROUPS IN TAJIKSTAN AND KASHMIR.  ALTHOUGH 
THE NATURE OF THESE CONTACTS IS SHADOWY, THE PAIC AND 
CIPF CLEARLY OFFER OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS 
ENCOURAGEMENT AND MORAL SUPPORT.  WE KNOW THE PAIC 
AND CIPF HAVE ALSO, ON OCCASION, FUNDED FOREIGN 
ISLAMISTS. 
 
14. OTHER TOOLS FOR SPREADING THE ISLAMIST AGENDA ARE 
SUDANESE ISLAMIC NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, 
AMONG WHICH DAWA ISLAMIIYA, MUWAFAQ, AND THE ISLAMIC 
AFRICAN RELIEF ASSOCIATION (IARA) ARE THE BEST 
KNOWN.  THEY OPERATE IN SEVERAL FOREIGN COUNTRIES, 
NOTABLY IN AFRICA.  OSTENSIBLY ENGAGED IN BENEVOLENT 
WORK, THESE NIF INSTRUMENTS ALSO SPREAD NIF VIEWS. 
THE FACT THAT THE CASH-STRAPPED GOS/NIF SPENDS 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR ON AIU, THE PAIC AND CIPF, 
AND ISLAMIC NGOS SPEAKS OF ITS COMMITMENT TO 
SPREADING ITS VERSION OF ISLAM AMONG MUSLIMS AND 
NON-MUSLIMS ALIKE.  THE MESSAGE BEING SPREAD 
INCLUDES, OF COURSE, HOSTILITY TO THE WEST AND THE 
U.S. 
 
------------------------------- 
GOS/NIF DESTABILIZING NEIGHBORS 
------------------------------- 
 
15. NOR DOES THE GOS/NIF MERELY PEACEFULLY PEDDLE ITS 
VIEWS ABROAD.  IT IS NOT LOATHE TO EXPORTING 
POLITICAL CHANGE BY FORCE.  GOS/NIF SUPPORT FOR THE 
ERITREAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, AN ISLAMIST MOVEMENT THAT 
SEEKS THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF THE ERITREAN 
GOVERNMENT, LED ASMARA TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
WITH KHARTOUM RECENTLY.  THERE IS ALSO CONVINCING 
EVIDENCE THE GOS/NIF IS MATERIALLY ASSISTING THE 
INSURGENT LORD\'S RESISTANCE ARMY (LRA) IN NORTHERN 
UGANDA. 
 
16. GIVEN THE SECRETIVE NATURE OF GOS/NIF LINKS TO 
MANY ISLAMIST GROUPS, IT PROBABLE BUT NOT PROVEN THAT 
IT IS SUPPORTING DESTABILIZATION EFFORTS ELSEWHERE AS 
WELL.  IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS, HOWEVER, SUDANESE 
ISLAMISTS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR SUBVERSION AS FAR 
AFIELD AS MAURITANIA AND TAJIKSTAN (REFS A AND B). 
THIS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUDANESE ISLAMISTS 
MAY HAVE AN AGENDA FOR DESTABILIZATION THAT GOES 
BEYOND SUDAN\'S IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS. 
 
------------------------ 
AND SUPPORTING TERRORISM 
------------------------ 
 
17. BESIDES BEFRIENDING RADICAL ISLAMISTS WORLDWIDE, 
THE GOS/NIF IS SPECIFICALLY SOLLICITOUS OF 
TERRORISTS.  IT HAS AN OPEN DOOR POLICY FOR EVERY 
MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST GROUP.  HAMAS, THE VARIOUS 
FACTIONS OF THE PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, THE ABU 
NIDAL ORGANIZATION, HIZBALLAH, THE POPULAR FRONT FOR 
THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE-GENERAL COMMAND, AND THE 
FRONT ISLAMIQUE DU SALUT (FIS) ALL ARE PRESENT HERE, 
OFTEN IN A SIGNIFICANT FASHION, WITH THE BLESSING OF 
THE GOS. 
 
18. THE INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST CARLOS LIVED HERE FOR 
MORE THAN A YEAR WITH THE PROTECTION OF SENIOR GOS 
OFFICIALS BEFORE KHARTOUM, UNDER PRESSURE FROM 
FRANCE, RELUCTANTLY TURNED HIM OVER.  RENEGADE SAUDI 
BUSINESSMAN OSAMA BIN LADEN, A PATRON OF 
INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIST EXTREMISTS, HAS MOVED HIS HOME 
AND HEADQUARTERS TO SUDAN. 
 
19. THANKS TO GOS/NIF HOSPITALITY, TERRORISTS OF 
EVERY DESCRIPTION CAN GATHER QUIETLY IN SUDANESE 
SAFE-HOUSES, FAR FROM THE UNWANTED ATTENTION OF THEIR 
HOME-COUNTRY SECURITY SERVICES.  SUDAN HAS ALSO 
PROVIDED DIFFERENT GROUPS MATERIAL ASSISTANCE AT 
VARIOUS TIMES.  ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO ISRAEL PUBLICLY 
PRODUCED A HAMAS MEMBER CAPTURED IN THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES, WHO CONFESSED HE HAD RECEIVED MILITARY 
TRAINING IN SUDAN.  ALSO A FEW WEEKS AGO, TUNISIA 
DISCLOSED IT HAD ARRESTED TEN TUNISIAN TERRORISTS WHO 
HAD TRAINED IN SUDAN (REF C).  REPORTING IN OTHER 
CHANNELS SHOWS THAT THE GOS/NIF HAS HELPED FUNNEL 
WEAPONS TO THE FIS AND GIVEN ARMS, TRAINING, FUNDS 
AND TRAVEL DOCUMENTS TO OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
--------------- 
DOES IT MATTER? 
--------------- 
 
20. IN FAIRNESS TO THE GOS/NIF, IT IS NOT THE FIRST 
GOVERNMENT IN THE REGION TO SUPPORT ITS NEIGHBORS\' 
INSURGENTS.  ARGUABLY, UGANDA BEGAN SUPPORTING THE 
SUDAN PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ARMY BEFORE SUDAN RESPONDED 
BY HELPING THE LRA.  GOS/NIF EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE 
ERITREA, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE UNPROVOKED. 
 
21. WE DEFER TO KAMPALA AND ASMARA FOR A DEFINITIVE 
ANALYSIS OF THE DANGER GOS/NIF BEHAVIOR POSES TO 
UGANDA AND ERITREA.  OUR SENSE IS THAT IN BOTH CASES 
IT IS TROUBLESOME BUT NOT REGIME-THREATENING. 
HOWEVER, THIS REFLECTS MORE, IN OUR VIEW, THE 
STRENGTHS OF BOTH REGIMES THAN A LACK OF A SERIOUS 
EFFORT ON THE GOS/NIF\'S PART TO CAUSE TROUBLE.  AND 
IT REMAINS THAT KHARTOUM IS FLOUTING INTERNATIONAL 
STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR AND EARNESTLY FOMENTING 
REBELLION IN COUNTRIES WHERE STABILITY IS A RECENT 
AND HARD-WON GAIN.  AT SOME POINT, IF THE GOS/NIF 
KEEPS TRYING HARD ENOUGH, ITS EFFORTS MIGHT BE MORE 
SUCCESSFUL, EITHER IN THESE TWO COUNTRIES OR 
ELSEWHERE. 
 
22. REGARDING TERRORISM, SUDAN, TO THE BEST OF OUR 
KNOWLEDGE, HAS STOPPED SHORT OF DIRECTLY SPONSORING 
AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  MOREOVER, THE 
GROUPS SUDAN ABETS ARE, FIRST AND FOREMOST, A PRODUCT 
OF THE INTERNAL TENSIONS IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY 
WERE BORN.  HAMAS, THE PIJ, OR THE FIS WILL EXIST 
WITH OR WITHOUT GOS/NIF HELP.  FURTHERMORE, THE 
NATURE OF THIS AID IS LIMITED.  SUDAN IS TOO POOR AND 
TOO WEAK A STATE TO GIVE THEM MORE THAN LIMITED HELP. 
 
23. THIS IS NOT, HOWEVER, THE SAME AS SAYING THAT 
GOS/NIF SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM DOES NOT MATTER.  THE 
LOW OR NO-COST ASSISTANCE SUDAN CAN READILY PROVIDE 
-- SAFE PLACES WHERE TERRORISTS CAN MEET, TRAIN, OR 
SIMPLY REST AND RECUPERATE DISCREETLY -- IS OF NO 
SMALL VALUE TO CLANDESTINE TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
24. TERRORISM, MOREOVER, REMAINS A RELATIVELY 
LOW-COST UNDERTAKING.  IT DOES NOT TAKE MASSIVE 
INFUSIONS OF WEAPONS OR CASH TO INCREASE A TERRORIST 
GROUP\'S ABILITY TO DO HARM.  EVEN DIRT-POOR SUDAN CAN 
GIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS REGARD. 
AGAIN, THE GROUPS SUDAN HELPS DO NOT NEED THE GOS/NIF 
TO THRIVE; THE HELP DOES ENHANCE, HOWEVER, THEIR 
ABILITY TO CAUSE TROUBLE.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT 
ANY HELP TERRORISTS RECEIVE IS TOO MUCH HELP. 
 
25. LASTLY, DOES IT MATTER THAT SUDAN INDOCTRINATES 
ITS OWN PEOPLE AND OTHERS IN RADICAL ISLAM?  IT 
PROBABLY DOES.  PRECISELY WHAT IMPACT 
SUDANESE-TRAINED ISLAMISTS HAVE WHEN THEY RETURN TO 
THEIR HOME COUNTRIES IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL.  AT A 
MINIMUM, HOWEVER, SUDAN\'S EFFORTS ARE INCREASING THE 
NUMBERS OF THOSE, IN AND OUT OF SUDAN, COMMITTED TO 
MILITANT ISLAM AND CONVINCED THE U.S. IS ITS FOE. 
THIS CAN DO NO GOOD AND CAN CAUSE SOME HARM. 
 
26. IT IS PROBABLY NO ACCIDENT THAT MOST OF THE 
DEFENDENTS IN THE CURRENT NEW YORK CITY BOMBINGS 
TRIAL ARE SUDANESE.  THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE 
GOS/NIF DIRECTED THEM TO COMMIT TERRORISM IN THE 
U.S.  WE DO THINK, HOWEVER, THAT GOS/NIF RADICAL 
PROPAGANDA MAY HAVE HELPED THEM CONVINCE THEMSELVES 
THE U.S. HAS A MAJOR ENEMY OF ISLAM.  FROM THERE ON 
IT BECAME EASIER FOR THEM TO CONCLUDE THAT 
ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORISM WAS JUSTIFIED IN THE NAME OF 
JIHAD. 
 
27. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE GOS/NIF\'S ABILITY TO 
DO HARM MUST NOT BE OVERSTATED.  MIDDLE EASTERN 
TERRORISTS WILL STILL OPERATE, REGIONAL STABILITY IN 
THE HORN AND ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA WILL REMAIN FRAGILE, 
AND RADICAL ISLAMISTS WORLDWIDE WILL CONTINUE TO 
REVILE AND OPPOSE THE U.S. REGARDLESS OF WHAT SUDAN 
DOES OR DOES NOT DO.  GOS/NIF BEHAVIOR, HOWEVER, 
MAKES THINGS WORSE ON ALL THREE SCORES. 
28. IRONICALLY, THIS FOURTH-WORLD COUNTRY THAT RANKS 
ON THE BOTTOM RUNG OF ALMOST EVERY INDICE OF 
DEVELOPMENT -- PER CAPITA GDP, LEVELS OF LITERACY AND 
INFANT MORTALITY, AND THE LIKE -- MANAGES TO PROJECT 
INFLUENCE ABROAD.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS UNIFORMLY 
NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF U.S. INTERESTS AND VALVES. 
GOS/NIP MISCHIEF-MAKING THUS DOES MATTER.  JUST HOW 
MUCH IT MATTERS DEPENDS HOW MUCH ONE VALVES THE 
INTERNATIONAL LEGALITY SUDAN BRAZENLY FLOUTS.

E.O. DECL.: 05/29/2000 
TAGS:  PREL, SU, US 
SUBJECT:  A CONVERSATION WITH BASHIR 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  PRESIDENT BASHIR AND I MET FOR OVER TWO HOURS AT HIS 
HOME SUNDAY NIGHT, MAY 28.  THE ONLY OTHER PERSON 
PRESENT WAS GENERAL FATIH IRWAH, WHOM BASHIR WANTS TO BE 
HIS AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON.  WHEN I NOTED THAT, EXCEPT 
FOR BRIEF ENCOUNTERS AT RECEPTIONS, IT HAD BEEN A YEAR 
AND A HALF SINCE OUR LAST MEETING, BASHIR REPLIED THAT 
DURING THAT TIME HE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY REQUEST FROM ME 
FOR A MEETING.  I SAID I HAD TRIED AT LEAST TWICE TO GET 
AN APPOINTMENT.  HE DID NOT RESPOND WHEN I SAID THAT 
PERHAPS SOMEONE HAD NOT FORWARDED MY REQUESTS. 
 
3.  BASHIR SAID, WITH REGARD TO BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH 
THE U.S., \"IT IS WE WHO FEEL BITTERNESS.\"  WHEN HIS 
REGIME CAME TO POWER BY OVERTHROWING A DEMOCRATICALLY 
ELECTED GOVERNMENT, \"WE UNDERSTOOD 513\" AND WHY IT 
REQUIRED A CESSATION OF ECONOMIC AID TO SUDAN. 
INDICATIVE OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT\'S DESIRE FOR GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH WASHINGTON, THEY GAVE A CABINET JOB TO 
GENERAL HADI MAMOUN (FYI:  THE LATE MAJ. GEM. MOHAMMED 
AL-HADI MAMOUN AL-MARDI.  END FYI.), WHO THEY KNEW HAD A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CIA.  HE BECAME A MINISTER \"EVEN 
THOUGH SOME COMPLAINED.\"  WITH BASHIR\'S APPROVAL, 
GENERAL MAMOUN MAINTAINED HIS TIES WITH THE STATION 
CHIEF, AT ONE POINT FLYING TO EUROPE TO MEET WITH HIM 
THERE. 
 
4.  BUT, BASHIR SAID, \"THE U.S. ATTITUDE CONTINUALLY 
ACCELERATED AGAINST US.\"  HE HAD THOUGHT THAT MY ARRIVAL 
MIGHT MEAN A \"NEW BEGINNING TO RECONSTRUCT RELATIONS.\" 
BUT INSTEAD THEY WORSENED.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE GOS HAD 
TRIED TO GIVE US FACTS ABOUT \"THE JUBA INCIDENT\" (I.E., 
IN 1992 WHEN USAID FSNS WERE EXECUTED, BUT WASHINGTON 
ONLY BECAME MORE NEGATIVE.  HE CITED \"THE U.S. CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST US\" AND STATED THAT IT STEMMED FROM \"A HOSTILE 
ATTITUDE RATHER THAN A FACTUAL BASIS.\"  HE THEN MADE THE 
FAMILIAR COMPLAINT THAT THE U.S. HAS SINGLED OUT SUDAN 
FOR CENSURE ON HUMAN RIGHTS WHILE SOFT-PEDALING 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES, LIKE EGYPT, SAUDI 
ARABIA AND \"YOUR FRIEND MUSEVENI.\" 
 
5.  TURNING TO THE WAR IN THE SOUTH, BASHIR SAID HE HAD 
INHERITED IT FROM NIMEIRY AND SADIQ.  THE GOS HAD MADE 
CONCESSIONS THAT NO OTHER GOVERNMENT HAD MADE; IT HAS 
IMPLEMENTING A TRULY FEDERAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND 
WAS NOT APPLYING SHARIA IN THE SOUTH.  DESPITE THE 
\"NEGATIVE MILITARY CONSEQUENCES\" THE GOS GAVE APPROVAL 
TO OLS OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTH.  HE GRUMBLED THAT EVEN 
THOUGH THE SUDANESE ARMY HAS MADE GAINS AND CONTROLS 
NINETY PERCENT OF THE TERRITORY IN THE SOUTH, THE OLS 
CONTINUES TO SEND NINETY PERCENT OF RELIEF SUPPLIES TO 
SPLA-HELD TERRITORY.  THE OLS, HE CHARGED, IS FEEDING 
THE SPLA. 
 
6.  SUMMING UP, BASHIR SAID, \"WHATEVER WE DO, THE 
OUTCOME IS MORE PRESSURE AND HOSTILITY\" FROM 
WASHINGTON.  HE PROTESTED THAT \"WE IN PRINCIPLE DO NOT 
HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST THE U.S.  WE WANT GOOD RELATIONS 
WITH THE U.S.\" 
 
7.  I INITIATED MY RESPONSE BY FIRST STRESSING THAT 
CONTRARY TO WHAT HIS GOVERNMENT AND TURABI SAY, THE USG 
IS NOT ANTI-ISLAMIC, AND I SPELLED OUT WHY MY ASSERTION 
HAS TRUE.  AS FOR WHY WE HAVE FOCUSED SO MUCH NEGATIVE 
ATTENTION ON SUDAN, I WENT THOUGH THE CUMULATIVE FACTORS 
THAT ACCOUNT FOR THIS, NOTING THAT I HAD EXPLAINED THIS 
TO HIM AND OTHERS HERE MANY TIMES.  ON HUMAN RIGHTS, I 
SAID IT DID SUDAN NO GOOD TO COMPARE ITS RECORD WITH 
OTHERS\'.  SUDAN HAD TO OWN UP TO ITS PROBLEMS AND BEGIN 
TO ADDRESS THEM.  THE ARREST OF SADIQ AL-MAHDI AND SOME 
OF HIS FOLLOWERS SOLELY BECAUSE OF SADIQ\'S RECENT PUBLIC 
CRITICISMS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND TURABI\'S POPULAR 
ISLAMIC CONFERENCE HAS A CASE IN POINT. 
 
8.  I TOLD BASHIR AND FATIH THAT SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER 
IS A CAREFUL LAWYER WHO WOULD NOT TAKE A FAR-REACHING 
DECISION TO PLACE SUDAN ON THE LIST OF STATE SPONSORS OF 
TERRORISM UNLESS HE HAD A SOLID, FACTUAL BASIS FOR HIS 
ECISION.  I SAID IT HAS A FACT THAT THE PIJ, MAMAS, ABU 
NIDAL ORGANIZATION, HIZBALLAH, GAMAA ISLAMIA AND OTHER 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS HAVE OFFICES IN KHARTOUM AND 
INTERACT WITH ELEMENTS OF BASHIR\'S GOVERNMENT.  IN 
RECENT MONTHS TWO SHIPMENTS OF ARMS FROM THE IRANIANS TO 
THE FIS HAD PASSED THROUGH SUDAN.  THE IRANIANS HERE 
HAVE DEALINGS WITH TERRORISTS, I ADDED. 
 
9.  I DEFENDED THE OLS OPERATIONS, STATING THAT THE UN 
IS NEUTRAL AND ENDEAVORING ONLY TO RELIEVE THE SUFFERING 
OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE WAR.  THE DISTRIBUTION OF 
FOOD HAS MADE SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF ON-THE-SPOT 
ASSESSMENTS OF THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE.  THE 
DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF FOOD THAT GOES TO SPLA-HELD 
TERRITORY IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE HUGE NUMBER OF 
DISPLACED SOUTHERNERS THERE, TENS OF THOUSANDS AT LABONE 
FOR EXAMPLE, AS OPPOSED TO RELATIVELY FEW CIVILIANS IN 
THE TOWNS HELD BY THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
10.  BASHIR DEFENDED THE DETENTION OF SADIQ.  ASKING 
RHETORICALLY WHETHER I HAD HEARD OF BRIGADIER ABDULAZIZ 
KHALID AND HIS \"ALLIANCE FORCES,\" HE SAID SADIQ AND 
OTHERS IN THE UMMA LEADERSHIP HAD SIGNED THE 
PROCLAMATION CALLING FOR ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE 
REGIME.  AND IN HIS SERMON AT THE ANSAR MOSQUE TWO WEEKS 
AGO, SADIQ HAD ENDORSED THE SPILLING OF BLOOD.  I 
REPLIED THAT IF SADIQ HAD COMMITTED A CRIME UNDER 
SUDANESE LAW, HE SHOULD BE CHARGED AND TRIED IN A COURT 
OF LAW.  FATIH SAID THAT SADIQ IS BEING HANDLED IN 
CONFORMACE WITH THE LAW, WHICH ALLOWS PERSONS TO BE HELD 
WITHOUT CHARGE WHILE EVIDENCE IS BEING GATHERED. 
 
11.  BASHIR DENIED THAT ANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS I 
MENTIONED, EXCEPT FOR HAMAS, HAVE OFFICES HERE.  HE SAID 
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION HAD REQUESTED THIS PRIVILEGE 
BUT HAD BEEN TURNED DOWN.  THE GOS ALSO HAD DENIED A 
SIMILAR REQUEST BY THE ARMED JIBRIL ORGANIZATION. 
HIZBALLAH HAS OFFICES AND PEOPLE IN OTHER CITIES AND 
DOES NOT NEED ONE HERE.  THE GOS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
GAMIAT ISLAMIYA.  SUDAN DOES NOT CONSIDER MAMAS TO BE A 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.  IT HAS COMMITTED NO ACTS OF 
VIOLENCE OUTSIDE THE \"OCCUPIED TERRITORIES,\" HE 
ASSERTED.  LATER, I MENTIONED SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS 
THAT I HAVE ABOUT THE TERRORIST PRESENCE IN KHARTOUM 
(SEPTEL). 
 
12.  BASHIR BROUGHT UP HIS APPOINTMENT OF FATIH TO BE 
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.  HE SAID \"THIS APPOINTMENT IS MY 
APPOINTMENT,\" NOT THE FOREIGN MINISTER\'S OR ANYONE 
ELSE\'S.  FATIH WOULD \"CARRY MY PERSONAL VIEW, 
ACCURATELY, IN MY NAME\" AND WOULD \"REPORT BACK HONESTLY 
AND ACCURATELY.\"  HE SAID THIS PROVED THAT HE WANTS \"A 
DIRECT LINK TO WASHINGTON,\" NOT ONE HAMPERED BY A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
(ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THIS TOPIC BY SEPTEL IN AGREMENT 
CHANNEL.) 
 
13.  WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE PEACE PROCESS.  I WILL REPORT 
ON THIS ASPECT IN A SEPTEL THAT WILL HAVE WIDER 
DISTRIBUTION THAN THIS CABLE\'S. 
 
14.  COMMENT:  EXCEPT FOR BRIEF MOMENTS, THE 
MEETING WAS VERY AMICABLE.  I AM CONVINCED THAT BASHIR 
REALLY DOES WANT BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., BUT WE 
SIMPLY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET THROUGH TO HIM THAT OUR 
QUARRELS WITH HIS REGIME ARE BASED ON VALID CONCERNS. 
HE SAYS HE KNOWS THAT I AM BEING HONEST WITH HIM AND 
SEEMS TO APPRECIATE THAT.  NEVERTHELESS HE EITHER IS 
POORLY INFORMED ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS THE OFFICES THAT 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS DO INDEED HAVE HERE, OR HE IS 
BEING DISINGENUOUS.  WE AGREED THAT WE NEED TO TRY A NEW 
TACK IN TRYING TO OVERCOME THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 
U.S. AND SUDAN AND THAT WE WILL DISCUSS THIS AGAIN.

SUBJECT:  BASHIR TAKES CHARGE? 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 3996 
 
1.  COL. (RETD) MARTIN MALWAL AROP, A LONG TIME EMBASSY 
CONTACT, TOLD THE DCM LAST NIGHT THAT PRESIDENT OMAR EL 
BASHIR IS ASSERTING HIS AUTHORITY AS COMANDER IN CHIEF OF 
THE ARMED FORCES TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF THE NATIONAL 
ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) ON THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN.  MALWAL 
SAID THAT BASHIR RECENTLY CONVENED A MEETING OF SENIOR 
MILITARY OFFICERS TO SOLICIT SUPPORT FOR THIS COURSE OF 
ACTION.  AT THIS MEETING, BASHIR SPECIFICALLY ASKED 
BRIGADIER EL HADI ABDULLAH MOHAMED, COMMANDER OF THE 
HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE AND KNOWN NIFER, IF HE WOULD SUPPORT 
HIM.  (FYI: THE MISSION OF BRIGADIER HADI\'S BRIGADE IS TO 
DEFEND THE CAPITAL AND MILITARY HEADQUARTERS AGAINST A 
COUP ATTEMPT.  HADI WAS CHOSEN TO COMMAND THIS UNIT 
BECAUSE OF HIS SYMPATHY FOR THE NIF.  END FYI.)  HADI AND 
THE OTHER OFFICERS PRESENT AT THE MEETING PROMISED BASHIR 
THEIR SUPPORT. 
 
2.  MARTIN DID NOT KNOW THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF BASHIR\'S 
ACTION BUT SAID MANY THINGS WERE GOING ON THAT OF WHICH 
BASHIR EITHER DID NOT APPROVE OR WAS UNAWARE.  THE DCM 
WONDERED WHY IT HAD TAKEN BASHIR SIX YEARS TO FIGURE THIS 
OUT.  MARTIN DEFENDED BASHIR, WHO SAID HE WAS A MILITARY 
ACADEMY BATCH MATE OF HIS, SAYING IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 
JUNE 30, 1989 COUP THAT BROUGHT BASHIR TO POWER HE HAD 
CALLED ON ALL ELEMENTS TO RALLY TO THE GOVERNMENT BUT ONLY 
THE NIF HAD COME FORWARD.  HE ALSO ARGUED THAT BASHIR WAS 
SIMPLY UNAWARE OF ACTIVITIES SOME OF THE NIF MEMBERS OF 
THE GOVERNMENT HAD UNDERTAKEN.  FINALLY, MARTIN SAID THAT 
AS TIME PASSED BASHIR FEARED THAT EVEN IF HE WANTED TO 
MAKE CHANGES THE NIF HAD SO INFILTRATED ALL ELEMENTS OF 
THE SUDANESE POWER STRUCTURE THAT HE COULD NOT BE SURE 
THAT ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE THINGS SUCCEED.  MARTIN SAID THAT 
VIRTUALLY EVERYONE AROUND BASHIR WAS A NIF LOYALIST AND 
THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME OF BASHIR\'S ATTEMPT TO ASSERT 
AUTHORITY WILL BE HIS ASSASSINATION. 
 
3.  MARTIN SAID BASHIR\'S NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO PURGE 
SUDAN\'S SECURITY SERVICE OF THOSE LOYAL TO OUSTED CHIEF 
NAFI ALI NAFI (REPORTING IN OTHER CHANNELS INDICATES THIS 
MAY ALREADY HAVE BEGUN).  AS HAS BEEN HINTED IN THE LOCAL 
MEDIA, MARTIN ALSO PREDICTED FURTHER CHANGES IN THE 
GOVERNMENT. 
 
4.  COMMENT: COL. MARTIN HAS MAINTAINED EXCELLENT CONTACTS 
WITH THE SUDANESE ARMY.  AS MEMBER OF BASHIR\'S 
REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL HE WAS KNOWN BE CLOSE TO THE 
PRESIDENT.  THE FACT THAT MARTIN HAS CONSORTED WITH U.S. 
DIPLOMATS AND OTHERS NOT SEEN TO BE FRIENDLY TO THIS 
REGIME WITHOUT HARASSMENT OR HINDERENCE ALSO INDICATES A 
HIGH LEVEL PATRON.  MARTIN\'S VIEW OF THE IMMEDIATE 
POST-COUP RELATIONSHIP VIOLATES CONVENTIONAL WISDOM BUT 
THE REALITY IS NOT KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY.  HIS INFORMATION 
HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN ENTIRELY ACCURATE (E.G., LAST YEAR HE 
TOLD US THAT THE GOS HAD LAUNCHED A THREE PRONGED 
OFFENSIVE WHEN, IN FACT, IT HAD ONLY PLANNED SUCH AN 
OFFENSIVE).  WE HAVE NO CORROBORATION, BUT WE BELIEVE 
THERE IS AT LEAST A KERNEL OF TRUTH IN WHAT HE HAS TOLD US 
AND THEREFORE REPORT IT. 
 
5.  SINCE THE WHOLESALE LEADERSHIP CHANGES IN THE SECURITY 
SERVICES AND THE LESS SWEEPING CABINET CHANGES ON AUGUST 
12 (SEE REFTEL), WE HAVE SENSED THAT FISSURES MIGHT BE 
OCCURING IN WHAT HAD BEEN VIEWED AS A MONOLITHIC GOS/NIF 
REGIME.  BASHIR\'S ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY THAT ALL 
POLITICAL DETAINEES WOULD BE RELEASED AND THAT ELECTIONS 
FOR BOTH PARLIAMENT AND THE PRESIDENCY WOULD TAKE PLACE 
NEXT YEAR ADD TO THAT SENSE. 
 
5.  WE CANNOT, OF COURSE, BE CERTAIN WHAT PROMPTED BASHIR 
TO ACT AFTER SIX YEARS OF NIF MISBEHAVIOR BUT THE MUBARAK 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT COULD WELL HAVE DONE IT.  BASHIR 
KNOWS THAT AT SOME POINT THE ETHIOPIANS WILL GO PUBLIC. 
HE COULD SIMPLY BE PREPARING THE GROUND FOR A DEFENSE THAT 
WOULD ADMIT PROBLEMS BUT CLAIM THEY ARE SOLVED, OR HE 
COULD BE AFTER A MORE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN HIS 
GOVERNMENT.  IF THE LATTER IS TRUE, HIS LIFE MAY WELL BE 
IN DANGER. MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

E.O. 12958:  DECL: 08/22/12; 
 
TAGS: PREL, PTER, SU 
SUBJECT:    THE CHANGED FACE OF POLITICAL ISLAM IN SUDAN 
 
CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE HAYWOOD RANKIN FOR REASON 1.5 (B-D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  THE REMOVAL OF TURABI IN 1999 EFFECTED A 
REVERSAL IN SUDAN\'S POLITICAL APPROACH TOWARD ISLAM, EVEN THOUGH 
THE PERSONNEL OF THE REGIME OTHERWISE REMAINED LARGELY IN 
PLACE.  THE REGIME MAINTAINS RELATIVELY TIGHT CONTROL OVER THE 
MOSQUES, IN ORDER TO SUPPRESS RATHER THAN FOMENT ISLAMIC 
POLITICAL FERVOR.  THE EMPHASIS TODAY IS A RETURN TO A LESS 
INTOLERANT ISLAM WHICH STAYS OUT OF POLITICS, WHILE SHARI\'A IS 
KEPT IN PLACE.  THE REGIME\'S STALWARTS, WHO WERE SO PASSIONATELY 
ISLAMIST A HALF-DECADE AGO, NOW ARE SEIZED BY A WISH TO HOLD ON 
TO POWER AND PERSONAL WEALTH, AN OBJECTIVE WHICH THEY SEE AS 
ONLY ACHIEVABLE BY DISAVOWING THEIR FORMER ISLAMIC MILITANCY. 
THEY STILL FEAR TURABI, WHICH IS WHY HIS HOUSE ARREST HAS BEEN 
RECENTLY EXTENDED.  END SUMMARY 
 
------------------------------------ 
TURABI\'S REMOVAL BRINGS A SEA CHANGE 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (C) THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF THE RULING REGIME IN SUDAN ARE 
TODAY HUGELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY WERE A FEW YEARS AGO.  THE 
TRANSFORMATION HAS BEEN RAPID ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. 
HOW PROFOUND AND LASTING IS THE TRANSFORMATION?  IS IT \"REAL\"? 
WILL SOME CABAL OF HARDLINERS WITHIN THE REGIME (FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE ARMY) REGAIN CONTROL AND SHIFT IT SUDDENLY BACK TO THE 
MILITANCY OF THE FIRST DECADE OF THE REGIME? 
 
3.  (C) NO ONE CAN ANSWER SUCH QUESTIONS WITH COMPLETE 
CONFIDENCE, BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LONG ENOUGH LAPSE OF TIME -- 
NEARLY THREE YEARS -- SINCE HASAN AL-TURABI\'S REMOVAL AS 
SPRITIAL LEADER OF THE REGIME TO CONCLUDE THAT HIS REMOVAL HAD A 
MUCH MORE PROFOUND EFFECT THAN COULD BE GENERALLY IMAGINED. 
NOWHERE IS THIS MORE EVIDENT THAN IN THE MODERATION BEING 
INTEGRATED INTO THE PUBLIC GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PROPAGATION OF 
ISLAM. 
 
4.  (C) DISCONTENT WITH THE DIRECTION TURABI WAS TAKING SUDAN -- 
DISCONTENT WITHIN THE REGIME ITSELF, NOT TO MENTION IN SUDANESE 
SOCIETY GENERALLY -- HAD BEEN MOUNTING FOR SOME YEARS.  INDEED, 
IT HAD BEEN LATENT FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE COUP THAT BROUGHT 
THE REGIME TO POWER.  BUT IT WAS TURABI\'S REMOVAL AND EVENTUAL 
HOUSE ARREST THAT FREED THE REGIME TO REVERSE COURSE. 
 
5.  (C) TURABI WAS UNIQUE IN SUDANESE RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL 
SOCIETY.  HIS UNIQUENESS LAY IN HIS COMBINATION OF PASSIONATE 
ISLAMIST IDEALISM AND EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO PERSUADE AND 
MOBILIZE FOLLOWERS.  INDEED, HE WAS UNIQUE IN ARAB SOCIETY WRIT 
LARGE.  HE NEVER OCCUPIED THE PRESIDENCY, THE OFFICE FROM WHICH 
MOST ARAB OR AFRICAN POTENTATES EXERCISE WIDE POWER, AND HE WAS 
ABLE NOT ONLY TO BRING THE REGIME UNDER HIS SPELL, BUT GIVE 
SUDAN -- AN IMPOVERISHED, PARTIALLY UNGOVERNABLE, ISOLATED,AND 
MARGINAL STATE -- A MALEFICENT INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE ARAB 
WORLD.  APPARENTLY, THERE IS NO ONE TO TAKE HIS PLACE, INSIDE OR 
OUTSIDE THE REGIME.  THE REGIME\'S CONTINUED FEAR OF TURABI WAS 
DEMONSTRATED AUGUST 18 WHEN HIS HOUSE ARREST ON FLIMSY CHARGES 
(SIGNING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SUDAN PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION 
MOVEMENT, OF ALL THINGS) WAS EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER YEAR.  THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT MADE CLEAR THAT THIS EXTENSION WAS INFINITELY 
RENEWABLE. 
 
----------------------------------- 
PRAGMATISM, OR CORRUPTION, PREVAILS 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) AS SOMEONE ONCE SAID, POWER CORRUPTS.  AS IN ALL AFRICAN 
AND ARAB SOCIETIES, GOVERNMENT IS THE MEANS BY WHICH WEALTH IS 
ACHIEVED AND DISTRIBUTED.  TURABI UNCEASINGLY SOUGHT TO 
CONSOLIDATE HIS CONTROL, TO MAXIMIZE HIS POLITICAL POWER, JUST 
AS MEMBERS OF THE REGIME WERE AMASSING WEALTH AND GETTING TO BE 
VERY FOND OF THEIR WEALTH AND STATUS.  THE WRITING WAS ON THE 
WALL FOR THE LEADER OF THE COUP HIMSELF, PRESIDENT BASHIR.  HE 
HAD TO ACT, AND HE FOUND IN TAKING ACTION AGAINST TURABI THAT 
THE TIDES WITHIN THE REGIME WERE RUNNING AGAINST TURABI AND NOT 
HIMSELF. 
 
7.  (C) TURABI WOULD HAVE WON THAT STRUGGLE IF HIS ERSTWHILE 
FOLLOWERS WITHIN THE REGIME HAD BELIEVED HIS VISION WOULD KEEP 
THEM IN POWER.  THEY KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT NO DEMOCRATIC 
ELECTION WOULD HAVE PUT HIM OR THEM IN POWER, BUT THEY ALSO KNEW 
THAT SUCH POPULARLITY OR ACCEPTANCE AS THE REGIME HAD HAD IN 
SUDANESE SOCIETY WAS DIMINISHING, NOT INCREASING.  AN IMPORTANT 
ELEMENT OF RISING DISCONTENT WAS THE REGIME\'S ISLAMIC 
STRINGENCY, BY WHICH THE REGIME HAD NOT ONLY INTERJECTED 
RELIGIOUS RIGIDITY INTO DAILY LIFE BUT HAD ALSO DEEPENED CIVIL 
WAR AND BROUGHT THE COUNTRY INTO LOGGERHEADS WITH MOST OF ITS 
NEIGHBORS, NOT TO MENTION MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD.  THE 
STRICTER AND MORE AGGRESSIVE APPLICATION OF ISLAMIC LAW 
CONFLICTED WITH SUDAN\'S TRADITIONAL SUFISM, AND THE DEEPENING OF 
CIVIL WAR AND INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION BROUGHT ECONOMIC DISASTER. 
 
8.  (C) TURABI BUCKED MANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY 
OF KHARTOUM (WHERE TURABI CONTINUES TO HAVE A STRONG FOLLOWING) 
AND SENT THEM ABROAD TO THE WEST, ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES, 
FOR POLISHING.  THEY NOW FORM A KEY PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AND 
ECONOMIC ELITE, AND THEY OFTEN IMPRESS WESTERNERS WITH THEIR 
COMMAND OF ENGLISH, THEIR CIVILITY, AND THE EASE WITH WHICH THEY 
RELATE TO WESTERNERS.  TURABI APPARENTLY WAS NOT AFRAID THAT 
THEY WOULD BE CORRUPTED AND LOSE THEIR ISLAMIC FERVOR, BUT IN 
THIS HE WAS ONLY PARTIALLY RIGHT.  THEY MAY HAVE COME BACK 
WITHOUT HAVING LOST PERSONAL ISLAMIC DEVOUTNESS -- SOME WERE NO 
DOUBT MADE EVEN MORE DEVOUT BY WHAT THEY SAW IN THE WEST -- BUT 
THEY ALSO PICKED UP A LIKING OF THE GOOD LIFE AND A DOSE OF 
WESTERN PRAGMATISM, WHICH DULLED THE EDGE OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM 
FOR TURABI\'S BRAND OF POLITICIZED ISLAM THAT HAD LED TO WAR, 
ISOLATION, AND ECONOMIC DOLDRUMS. 
 
---------------------- 
SHARI\'A AND DEVOUTNESS 
---------------------- 
 
9.  (C) THE BASHIR REGIME WANTS TO HOLD ON TO SHARI\'A LAW AND A 
CONSERVATIVE INTERNAL APPROACH TO ISLAM, AND IN THIS INSISTENCE 
IT PROBABLY IS NOT AT VARIANCE WITH A MAJORITY,OR AT LEAST A 
LARGE SEGMENT, OF THE NORTHERN SUDANESE POPULATION.  AFTER ALL, 
ARAB SOCIETY GENERALLY, FROM MOROCCO TO OMAN, HAS BECOME MORE 
CONSERVATIVE OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS -- MORE TURNED INWARD 
INTO ITSELF, LESS WILLING TO TRY WESTERN IDEAS.  THE SAUDI MODEL 
OF STRINGENT ISLAM WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO KEEP OUT OF POLITICS IS 
TO SOME EXTENT THE IDEA TO WHICH THE REGIME NOW ASPIRES TO 
FOLLOW.  MILLIONS OF SUDANESE HAVE WORKED IN SAUDI ARABIA OVER 
THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES, AND THE SAUDIS HAVE POURED MONEY INTO 
THE COUNTRY, IN THEIR INIMITABLE FASHION, TO BUILD HUNDREDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF MOSQUES (EMPHASIS BEING MOSQUES OVER SCHOOLS, 
HOSPITALS, AND THE LIKE).  YET THE SUDANESE PERSONALITY REMAINS 
PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT FROM THE SAUDI, AS DIFFERENT AS SUFISM IS 
FROM WAHHABISM.  THE KEY TO THE DIFFERENCE -- OR AT LEAST ONE 
KEY -- IS THE SUFI EMPHASIS ON MINDING ONE\'S OWN BUSINESS: 
SUFISM IS ALL ABOUT LOOKING INTO ONE\'S OWN SOUL, 
SELF-PURIFICATION, LEADING BY EXAMPLE, AND NOT WORRYING TOO MUCH 
ABOUT ONE\'S NEIGHBOR.  THUS ARE THE SUDANESE FAMOUS FOR THEIR 
HUMILITY, SIMILAR TO THE OMANIS, ANOTHER PEOPLE REPUGNED BY THE 
SAUDIS AND FAMOUS FOR THEIR ABILITY TO BE DEVOUT AND RELATIVELY 
TOLERANT AT THE SAME TIME.  IT WAS ALL THE MORE AMAZING THAT 
SUDAN SHOULD HAVE PRODUCED ONE OF THE ARAB WORLD\'S MOST 
CHARISMATIC FIREBRANDS. 
 
9.  (C) IF THE REGIME RETAINS SHARI\'A LAW AND KEEPS ITS 
CONSERVATIVE VISION OF ISLAM TO THE NONPOLITICAL REALM, IT WILL 
THUS ONLY BE FOLLOWING AN INCREASINGLY CONSERVATIVE COURSE THAT 
HAS BEEN WIDELY FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT THE ARAB WORLD, AND ONE THAT 
IS LIKELY TO BE ACCEPTABLE WITHIN SUDANESE SOCIETY, EVEN IF IT 
IS SOMEWHAT MORE INTRUSIVE THAN WAS TRADITIONAL SUDANESE SUFI 
ISLAM.  THE DIVERSITY OF SUDANESE SOCIETY AND THE PRESENCE OF 
MILLIONS OF NON-MUSLIM SUDANESE IN KHARTOUM, DISPLACED BY WAR 
AND FAMINE -- A PATTERN LIKELY TO BE ONLY PARTIALLY ABATED BY A 
PEACE AGREEMENT -- CUTS BOTH WAYS:  IT SEEMS TO MAKE SOME 
MUSLIMS MORE OPEN-MINDED BY EXPOSING THEM TO NON-MUSLIM 
APPROACHES TO LIFE (JUST AS OMANI SOCIETY WAS SOFTENED BY LONG 
EXPOSURE TO AFRICA AND ASIA), BUT FOR OTHERS, IT CAUSES A MORE 
STEADFAST WITHDRAWAL INTO THE CIRCLE OF ISLAM.  HOW TOLERANT THE 
FACE OF SUDANESE ISLAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE WILL DEPEND ON 
LEADERSHIP OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN THE POST-PEACE ERA, BUT 
THE INDICATORS ARE THAT THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING BACK IN THE 
DIRECTION OF LESS INTOLERANCE. 
 
----------------------- 
CONTROLLING THE MOSQUES 
----------------------- 
 
10.  (C) ONCE YOU OPEN PANDORA\'S BOX, IT\'S NOT SO EASY TO 
CLOSE.  TURABI USED A SERIES OF STRATEGIC MOSQUES IN KHARTOUM 
AND OTHER LARGE TOWNS TO CONVEY HIS MESSAGE.  HE POLITICIZED 
THEM.  THE BASHIR REGIME IS NOW FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF 
PUTTING THE GENIE WHICH TURABI RELEASED BACK INTO ITS BOX.  ON 
THIS ISSUE IT APPEARS TO BE PARTICULARLY DETERMINED -- ODD AS IT 
MAY SEEM THAT A REGIME ONCE RENOWNED FOR ITS ISLAMIC FERVOR NOW 
TAKES PARTICULAR PAINS TO CONTROL THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH 
ISLAM IS PRACTICED.  THE MOSQUES ARE THE KEY PLACES OF 
ASSEMBLAGE IN SUDANESE SOCIETY, THE FOCAL POINTS IN EVERY MUSLIM 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND VILLAGE.  THE MESSAGES OF THE IMAMS, DAY AFTER 
DAY, WEEK AFTER WEEK, HAVE PROFOUND INFLUENCE ONTHE MINDS OF THE 
POPULACE.  AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE, THOSE MESSAGES ARE RIGOROUSLY 
FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- AND ESPECIALLY IN THOSE KEY 
BUT RELATIVELY FEW MOSQUES POLITICIZED BY TURABI -- BY THE 
SECURITY SERVICES.  THE MINISTRY OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS HAS VETO 
OVER THE PLACEMENT OF IMAMS IN ALL MOSQUES, AND IT HAS INDEED 
REPLACED SEVERAL IMAMS.  THE RESULT APPARENTLY IS THAT RELIGIOUS 
MESSAGES WHICH THE POPULACE IS HEARING TODAY DIFFERER MARKEDLY 
FROM WHAT THEY WERE HEARING ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO, WHEN TURABI 
STILL HELD SWAY.  DOWN WITH AMERICA AND SPREAD THE GOSPEL, 
JIHAD, VICTORY, AND MARTYRDOM HAVE GIVEN WAY TO THE MORE 
TRADITIONAL STUFF OF LOOKING AFTER YOUR OWN SOUL AND DOING GOOD 
TO OTHERS.  THIS SUDANESE REGIME IS NO DIFFERENT FROM MOST OTHER 
REGIMES IN THE MUSLIM WORLD IN WANTING TO EXERCISE CAREFUL 
CONTROL OVER RELIGION, BUT -- PERHAPS IN PART FOR THE VERY 
REASON THAT IT STARTED OFF AS AN \"ISLAMIC FRONT\" AND KNOWS 
BETTER WHEREOF IT SPEAKS, AND KNOWS MORE INTIMATELY WHAT IT 
FEARS -- IT SEEMS TO BE SUCCEEDING BETTER THAN MOST.

TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, SU, AL, IZ 
SUBJECT:    SUDAN\'S POSITION ON IRAQ 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 178 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION MARGUERITA RAGSDALE. 
REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS FORMALLY 
SPELLED OUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S VERY GENERALIZED AND 
NON-CONFRONTATIONAL POSITION ON IRAQ WHICH PUTS KHARTOUM BEHIND 
THE UNSC RESOLUTION AND THE WORK OF THE INSPECTORS.  THE 
POSITION IS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM VIEWS EXPRESSED BY SUDAN\'S 
FOREIGN MINISTER DAYS EARLIER AT THE ARAB LEAGUE MINISTERIAL 
MEETING IN CAIRO. IN THE MEANTIME, PRESIDENT BASHIR DECLINED TO 
ATTEND THE SHARM AL-SHEIKH SUMMIT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS PRESSING 
ISSUES AT HOME.  LOCAL PUBLIC OPINION APPEARS TO AGREE WITH 
BASHIR\'S CHOICE OF PRIORITIES. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C)  MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE AMERICAS 
DEPARTMENT AMBASSADOR MOHAMED AL-AMIN AL-KARIB CONVOKED DCM 
03/01 TO CONVEY A PAPER OUTLINING SUDAN\'S POSITION ON THE ISSUE 
OF IRAQ.  REFTEL NOTES THE CONCERTED EFFORT OF SUDAN\'S FOREIGN 
MINISTER DR. MUSTAPHA ISMAIL TO REPAIR DAMAGE CAUSED BY HIS 
REMARKS AT THE ARAB LEAGUE MINISTERIAL IN CAIRO.  IN THOSE 
COMMENTS, ISMAIL CAME OUT AGAINST ARAB STATES ALLOWING BASES AND 
FACILITIES IN THEIR COUNTRIES TO BE USED IN AN ATTACK AGAINST 
IRAQ.  THE MINISTER\'S SUBSEQUENT STATEMENTS INDICATED THAT HE 
HAD BACKED AWAY FROM THAT POSITION. 
 
2.  (C) FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF THE POSITION PAPER READ BY AL-KARIB 
AND HANDED OVER TO DCM AS A NON-PAPER. IT STATES THAT SUDAN\'S 
STANCE ON IRAQ IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: 
 
A. FIRM COMMITMENT TO THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE NECESSITY OF FULL COOPERATION BETWEEN 
IRAQ AND THE INSPECTORS, AS THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO AVOID WAR. 
 
B. WEAPONS INSPECTORS ARE THE CONCERNED BODY THAT WILL DECIDE 
WHETHER IRAQ HAS FULLY COMPLIED WITH SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTIONS; 
 
C. IT IS THE HOPE OF SUDAN THAT ALL WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION 
BE REMOVED FROM IRAQ WITHOUT WAR; 
 
D.  THIS SUDANESE POSITION WILL BE VOICED OUT IN ALL REGIONAL 
FORUMS SUCH AS THE ARAB LEAGUE, NAM, AND OIC.  AS WELL, SUDAN 
WILL ABIDE BY THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE REGIONAL FORUMS ON THE 
ISSUE; 
 
E.  IF THERE IS ANY SPECIFIC VIEWPOINT FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES ON THE ISSUE, THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT WILL BE 
READY TO HEIR THAT VIEW. 
 
3.  (C) EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR ASSIM TOLD CHARGE MILLINGTON THAT 
SUDAN\'S FM REVERSED HIS POSITION ON IRAQ \"BECAUSE SUDAN IS 
IRRELEVANT AS FAR AS IRAQ IS CONCERNED\" AND BECAUSE THE COUNTRY 
RISKED LOSING CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT POTENTIAL FROM GULF STATES 
SUCH AS KUWAIT, THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND SAUDI ARABIA. 
THESE COUNTRIES HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO INITIATE SERIOUS 
INVESTMENT OPTIONS HERE SINCE THEIR BREAK WITH SUDAN FOLLOWING 
THE 1991 GULF WAR. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT:  SUDAN\'S PRESIDENT OMAR BASHIR DECLINED TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT AT SHARM AL-SHEIKH, CITING 
\"INTERNAL ISSUES RELATED TO PEACE AND SECURITY IN SUDAN.\" 
FOREIGN MINISTER ISMAIL LED SUDAN\'S DELEGATION AND READ A 
STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT BASHIR THAT DID NOT GO BEYOND THOSE 
INNOCUOUS REMARKS QUOTED ABOVE.  PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN SUDAN 
GENERALLY SUPPORTED BASHIR\'S DECISION NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT.  WHILE THERE IS WIDESPREAD PUBLIC OPPOSITION 
TO A U.S.-LED ATTACK AGAINST IRAQ, MOST SUDANESE APPEAR TO AGREE 
WITH BASHIR\'S POSITION THAT THERE ARE MORE PRESSING ISSUES THAT 
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AT HOME. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:    RETURN OF SUDANESE BA\'ATHISTS 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 317 
 
CLASSIFIED BY LAUREL STEELE, POLITICAL OFFICER, REASONS 1.5 B, D 
 
1.  (C) OVER 80 MEMBERS OF THE SUDANESE BA\'ATH PARTY HAVE 
RETURNED FROM IRAQ TO SUDAN IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.  THE MOST 
PROMINENT SUDANESE BA\'ATHIST AND FOUNDER OF THE PARTY IN SUDAN, 
BADR-ADDIN MUDATHIR, RETURNED, POST WAS TOLD, ON PRESIDENT OMAR 
AL-BASHIR\'S PLANE FROM SYRIA, LANDING AT KHARTOUM\'S MILITARY 
AIRPORT TEN DAYS AGO.  HIS RETURN WAS REPORTED IN THE PRESS, 
ALTHOUGH NO DETAILS WERE GIVEN. 
 
2.  (C) ANOTHER RETURNING SUDANESE REPORTED TO POST THAT SOME 
SUDANESE IN IRAQ HAD BEEN SHOT BY ANTI-SADDAM IRAQIS IN THE 
AFTERMATH OF THE US. INVASION.  OTHERS HAD FLED TO REFUGEE CAMPS 
ON THE IRAQ/SYRIA BORDER.  PRESIDENT BASHIR HAD VISITED SYRIA TO 
HELP FACILITATE THEIR DEPARTURE. 
 
3.  (C) THE GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTEDLY ALLOWED THE RETURN OF THE 
SUDANESE BA\'ATHISTS ON THE CONDITION THAT THEY NOT TAKE PART IN 
ANY POLITICAL ACTIVITY HERE.  THE GOS IS LEERY OF PUBLIC 
EXPRESSION OF ANTI-US OR ANTI-BRITISH FEELINGS.  IN THE BUILDUP 
TO THE IRAQ WAR, BA\'ATHISTS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANTI-GOVERNMENT 
GRAFFITI.  NINE LOCAL BA\'ATHISTS WERE ARRESTED AND ARE STILL IN 
JAIL.  MUDATHIR HIMSELF IS IN HIS SEVENTIES AND ILL, AND 
PRESUMABLY PRESENTS LITTLE PROBLEM TO THE GOS. 
 
4.  (U) BACKGROUND:  THE BA\'ATH PARTY IN SUDAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
SMALL, WITH PROBABLY NO MORE THAN 1,000 MEMBERS.  BUT BECAUSE 
IRAQ BACKED IT FINANCIALLY, THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF 
THE SUDANESE BA\'ATH PARTY HAVING AN IMPACT THAT BELIED ITS 
MEAGER NUMBERS.  THE PARTY RECRUITED HEAVILY AMONG STUDENTS 
(OFFERING SCHOLARSHIPS TO IRAQ) AND IN PERIPHERAL AREAS, LIKE 
NUBA, AND AMONG THE AFRICAN TRIBES.  IN 1990, 26 BA\'ATHIST 
MILITARY OFFICERS WERE EXECUTED IN KHARTOUM AFTER AN 
UNSUCCESSFUL COUP ATTEMPT.
