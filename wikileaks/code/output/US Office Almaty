PRIME MINISTER, THE RELATIVELY UNKNOWN AND 
UNINFLUENTIAL OQIL OQILOV, WAS A SURPRISE TO MANY. 
SOME SPECULATE THAT RAHMONOV\'S MAIN INTEREST WAS 
IN APPOINTINQ SOMEONE WHO HASN\'T MADE TOO MUCH 
MONEY WORKINQ IN THE GOTI.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) GENERAL HABIB SANQINOV, DEPUTY MINISTER OF 
INTERIOR IN THE GOTI, SUMMONED EMBASSY SENIOR FSN 
DECEMBER 14 TO DISCUSS HIS VIEWS OF PRESIDENT 
RAHMONOV\'S PLANS FOR RESHUFFLINQ HIS CABINET --

OQIL OQILOV AS THE NEW PRIME MINISTER (REFTEL). 
 
3.  (C) SANQINOV DESCRIBED A MEETINQ RAHMONOV HAD 
CALLED OF HIS SENIOR DEPUTIES ON OECEMBER 12. 
STARTINQ WITH THEN-PRIME MINISTER YAHYO AZIMOV, 
RAHMONOV BEQAN TO DISCUSS THE RESHUFFLE\'S 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THEM.  PHYSICALLY CARESSINQ 
AZIMOV TO MAXIMIZE THE MAN\'S HUMILIATION, RAHMONOV 
TOLD AZIMOV HE WOULD NOT BE LEFT WITHOUT A 
POSITION IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT (COMMENT:  WHAT 
THAT WOULD BE, RAHMONOV DID NOT SAY, BUT IT MUST 
HAVE BEEN CLEAR TO EVERYONE PRESENT THAT THE PRIME 
MINISTER\'S JOB WAS NOT WHAT RAHMONOV HAD IN MIND). 
 
4.  (C) RAHMONOV THEN ADDRESSED, ONE BY ONE, HIS 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTERS, MINISTERS, AND COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMEN.  RAHMONOV ENCOURAQED SOME, LIKE DEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTER ABDURAHMON AZIMOV, TO RUN IN

OTHERS, LIKE BASQUL DODIKHUDOEVA, THAT HE WOULD 
FIND SOME SORT OF POSITION IN THE NEXT QOVERNMENT 
FOR THEM, ALTHOUQH HE AVOIDED PROMISINQ ANYTHINQ 
SPECIFIC.  HE HAD NO SUQGESTIONS FOR SOME OTHERS, 
SUCH AS ISMAT ESHMIRZOEV -- ALL THEY LEARNED WAS 
THAT THEY WOULD SOON BE OUT OF A JOB.  OEPUTY 
PRIME MINISTERS TURAJONZADA, VAZIROV, AND RASULOV 
-- WHO HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE FOR LESS TIME THAN THE 
OTHERS -- WILL STAY ON IN THEIR CURRENT POSITIONS. 
 
5.  (C) RAHMONOV TOLD HIS CHIEF OF ADMINISTRATION, 
MAHMADNAZAR SALIHOV, TO CONSIDER RUNNINQ FOR A

WAIT AND SEE WHETHER YOU WILL AQREE TO DO SO OR 
NOT.\"  ACCORDINQ TO SANQINOV, THE MEETINQ LEFT THE 
FATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SECRETARY

THE CRISIS CAUSED BY THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OF 
UZBEKISTAN QUERILLA FORCE OPERATINQ ON 
TAJIKISTAN\'S TERRITORY AND SEIZINQ KYRQYZ AND

HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIQN OPPONENT, OAVLAT USMON, 
AND HIS WOULD-BE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIQN OPPONENTS, 
SULTAN QUVVATOV AND SEYFIDDIN TURAYEV.  RAHMONOV 
SAID HE PLANNED TO \"PURSUE\" TURAYEV (COMMENT: 
PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR OF THE THREE) TO THE 
POINT WHERE TURAYEV LEFT THE COUNTRY.  (COMMENT: 
RAHMONOV NEVER MAKES PEACE WITH HIS RIVALS -- 
ABDUMALIK ABDULLAJANOV, WHO FLED TO UZBEKISTAN, IS 
ANOTHER CASE IN POINT). 
 
NEW PRIME MINISTER\'S BIODATA 
--------------------------- 
7.  (C) OQIL OQILOV (ALTERNATIVE SPELLINQ:  AKIL 
AKILOV) WAS BORN IN 1944 IN KHOJAND, LENINABAD 
REQION (THE NORTHERN PART OF TAJIKISTAN).  AFTER 
QRADUATINQ IN CONSTRUCTION ENQINEERINQ FROM A 
MOSCOW INSTITUTE, HE WORKED AS A KHOJAND CITY 
GOVERNMENT CONSTRUCTION OFFICIAL, EVENTUALLY 
BECOMINQ MINISTER OF CONSTRUCTION IN THE 
QOVERNMENT OF THE THEN-TAJIK S.S.R.  HE REMAINED 
IN THE QOVERNMENT THROUQH INDEPENDENCE AND THE 
CIVIL WAR.  RAHMONOV APPOINTED HIM DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER IN LATE 1994.  HE SERVED IN THIS POSITION 
UNTIL RAHMONOV SENT HIM PACKINQ IN 1997.  HE 
RETURNED TO KHOJAND, WHERE HE WAS APPOINTED DEPUTY 
CHAIRMAN OF THE REQIONAL HUKUMAT (GOVERNMENT). 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
8.  (C) OQILOV\'S APPOINTMENT COMES AS A SURPRISE - 
- HE IS CONSIDERABLY LESS WELL-KNOW AND LESS 
INFLUENTIAL THAN SOME OF THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO 
WERE APPARENTLY IN THE RUNNINQ, SUCH AS DUSHANBE 
MAYOR AND RAHMONOV CONFIDANT MAHMADSAID 
UBAIDULLOEV.  LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR, AZIMOV, HE IS 
A NORTHERNER, AND HIS REGIONAL IDENTITY PROBABLY 
PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HIS SELECTION, WITH 
RAHMONOV KEEPINQ HIS BASE OF SUPPORT BROADER THAN 
HIS NATIVE KULYAB REQION IN THE SOUTH. 
 
9.  (C) SOME OBSERVERS SPECULATE THAT OQILOV\'S 
BEINQ OUT OF POWER, AND OUT OF THE CAPITAL, FOR AN 
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME PLAYED IN HIS FAVOR. 
RAHMONOV, THEY SAY, WANTED TO APPOINT SOMEONE WHO 
HAD NOT MADE AS MUCH MONEY IN QOVERNMENT AS HIS 
CURRENT CABINET MEMBERS.  TO ILLUSTRATE THE BANDIT 
CULTURE PREVAILINQ IN THE RAHMONOV REQIME, 
SANQINOV TOLD EMBASSY SENIOR FSN OF A RECENT VISIT 
TO DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ABDURAHMON AZIMOV\'S 
OFFICE.  AS THEY WERE TALKINQ, A TELEPHONE CALL 
FROM PRIME MINISTER YAHYO AZIMOV CAME THROUQH.  IN 
FRONT OF SANQINOV, ABDURAHMON AZIMOV COMPLAINED TO 
THE PRIME MINISTER THAT \"YOU HAVE BOUQHT ALMOST 
HALF OF KHOJAND AND HAVE ENOUQH TO LIVE ON.  I 
HAVE NOT QOT ANYTHINQ BEHIND ME AND HAVE NO 
PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE!\"

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PINR, KZ, POLITICAL 
SUBJECT: KAZAKHSTAN: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETING WITH OTAN PARTY 
LEADER YERMEGIYAYEV 
 
REF:  A) ALMATY 4769  B) ALMATY 4315  C) ALMATY 4274 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  During a December 21 introductory 
meeting with the Ambassador, pro-presidential Otan Party 
deputy chair Armangeldy Yermegiyayev described a party with 
a strong vertical structure, an extensive local network, 
and a clear platform.  He outlined a vision of quality-of- 
life improvements coupled with gradual democratic change. 
Yermegiyayev assessed the work of U.S.-funded democracy 
NGOs positively, reserving his criticism for opposition 
parties Ak Zhol and Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan and, 
somewhat surprisingly, first daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva\'s 
Asar.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) The Ambassador met with pro-presidential Otan Party 
deputy chair Armangeldy Yermegiyayev on December 21 at 
Otan\'s party headquarters in Almaty, the site of the 
November 28 explosions (ref A).  Party official Kazbek 
Kazkenov also took part in the meeting.  Since the October 
resignation of Zharmakhan Tuyakbay (ref B), one of the 
other two deputy chairs, Yermegiyayev has been the day-to- 
day leader of Otan.  Aleksandr Pavlov, the third deputy 
chairman, maintains a much lower profile than either of his 
counterparts.  President Nazarbayev is the chairman. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Membership Growing \"Voluntarily\" 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Yermegiyayev informed the Ambassador that Otan\'s 
membership had increased to 450,000, taking pains to note 
that members joined voluntarily out of a personal choice to 
support the party\'s ideology.  He added that the party had 
instituted monthly dues, ranging from 5 KZT to 50 KZT ($.04 
to $.38) according to income, specifically to prevent mass 
enrollments at institutions.  The party leader said that 
Otan has 9,100 party organizations at the primary level 
(i.e. institutions), an office staffed by two professional 
staff members in each raion (subdivision of an oblast), and 
an office staff by five professional staff members in each 
oblast.  Yermegiyayev explained that oblast party leaders 
are selected locally and then approved by the national 
organization, to maintain the party\'s strict vertical 
structure. 
 
4. (SBU) With the formation of the new Mazhilis and the 
adherence of several independent candidates to Otan, the 
party now holds 53 of the 77 seats in the lower house. 
(Note:  Mazhilis speaker Uraz Mukhamedzhanov and deputy 
speaker Sergey Dyachenko, although Otan members, do not 
count as part of the party bloc.  End note.)  Yermegiyayev 
remarked that political parties do not have offices or 
staff in the Parliament, as they do in the Russian Duma, 
implying that this was a shortcoming of the system.  He 
said that Otan favored a greater role for parties and had 
\"posed the question.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Otan Platform \"Does Not Always Match Government Policy\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5. (SBU) At the party\'s 7th congress, in early December, 
members had agreed on a number of changes to the party 
platform; according to Yermegiyayev, the new 2004-2009 
program would essentially be the party\'s presidential 
campaign platform.  He insisted that the party\'s views do 
not always match the government\'s policies, claiming that 
President Nazarbayev makes a clear distinction between his 
role as head of state and his job as party chairman.  To 
support his argument, he cited Otan\'s long-standing 
proposal to increase the Mazhilis from 77 to 120 seats, 
with half elected from party lists and half in single- 
member districts.  He described this as a way to make the 
situation fairer for smaller parties. Yermegiyayev also 
underscored his vision for Otan as a party of ideas, not of 
one person, that would outlast the current government. 
 
6. (SBU) Other elements of Otan\'s platform, according to 
Yermegiyayev, include giving parliament more control over 
the implementation of the national budget; equalizing the 
power of local elected bodies (maslikhats) with local 
executive authorities; giving maslikhat secretaries the 
right to run sessions on a continuous basis; and 
instituting the direct election of local leaders, with 
indirect election of raion leaders via the maslikhats. 
Yermegiyayev stressed that it would be \"dangerous\" to 
change the current practice of presidential appointment of 
 
 
oblast leaders, given the balance of ethnic majorities in 
different parts of the country.  He noted Russia\'s recent 
decision to do away with the election of governors as a 
relevant precedent.  Yermegiyayev said that Otan was 
carefully considering the question of the formation of the 
government; at its next congress, the party might propose 
that the parliamentary majority should select all the 
ministers and form the government. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Ambitious Goals for Quality of Life 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Without going into detail as to how Otan would 
accomplish its objectives, Yermegiyayev outlined a range of 
ambitious goals to improve the quality of life of the 
average citizen.  By 2009, pensions should equal 50% to 60% 
of the average wage; the current figure is approximately 
28%.  Salaries of teachers and doctors should be doubled. 
GDP per capita should double to $4000.  Spending on science 
should be raised from the current .16% to 1% of the budget. 
The government should institute a pro-natal policy with the 
goal of increasing the population to 20 million from its 
current level of 15 million.  The industrial base should be 
diversified. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Good Cooperation with U.S.-Funded NGOs 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Given the GOK\'s recent allegations that U.S.- 
funded democracy NGOs concentrated a disproportionate 
amount of their efforts on the opposition (ref C), the 
Ambassador asked Yermegiyayev about Otan\'s cooperation with 
the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the 
National Democratic Institute (NDI).  Yermegiyayev and 
Kazkenov indicated that the party enjoyed good relations 
with both organizations, as well as with USAID.  Kazkenov 
mentioned a recent IRI training program for young party 
members as an example of successful cooperation, noting 
that Otan had proposed organizing joint events open to all 
parties in oblast capitals to both NDI and IRI. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Opposition Politicians \"Only Desire Power\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9. (SBU) Turning to the Kazakhstani political opposition, 
Yermegiyayev\'s voice began to rise as he underscored what 
he described as the inherently hypocritical position of 
parties such as Ak Zhol and Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan 
(DCK).  He asked rhetorically what ideology could possibly 
unite the ultra-liberal DCK with the Communists, who had 
formed a voting bloc for the parliamentary elections. 
\"Only the desire for power,\" he claimed.  Noting that 
before becoming leader of Otan he himself had been a 
private businessman, Yermegiyayev pointed out that 
opposition leaders such as Zhandosov, Sarsenbayev, and 
Kazhegeldin had been in the government at the time of 
flawed privatizations and had \"created this problem with 
corruption.\"  He claimed that they had all benefited 
personally from crooked privatization deals and had fought 
viciously over the booty.  Yermegiyayev also singled out 
Zhandosov\'s call for the National Fund to be distributed 
directly to the people as a shockingly disingenuous 
populist move for a former Finance Minister.  Yermegiyayev 
reminded the Ambassador that Ak Zhol had also called for 
the reexamination of contracts signed with foreign 
investors in the early 1990s, and stressed that Otan 
understood the need to respect contracts. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Asar: Not Clear What They Stand For 
----------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) Yermegiyayev told the Ambassador that the 
leadership of first daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva\'s Asar 
party had approached Otan before the parliamentary 
elections with a proposal to form a voting bloc.  Otan had 
refused.  Yermegiyayev described his party\'s attitude 
toward Asar as mixed; while they did not view Asar as a 
serious competitor, they needed time to see what the other 
main pro-presidential party stood for.  He contrasted the 
two parties\' programs, claiming that Otan had made very 
specific proposals while Asar had made only vague 
statements such as support for raising pensions and more 
support for science.  Yermegiyayev remarked that time would 
 
 
show which party had a real program and represented the 
interests of the people.  (Comment:  While Yermegiyayev may 
well have genuine antipathy toward Asar, many observers 
believe that the parties are deliberately trying to 
distance themselves from each other in order to appeal to 
different groups of voters and increase their overall vote 
share.  End comment.) 
 
11. (SBU) Bio note:  Yermegiyayev was chairman of Otan from 
2002 to March 2004, when he stepped down and became a 
deputy chair at the 6th Otan party congress.  He is thought 
to be close to President Nazarbayev, as the latter chose 
him to be chairman of Otan even though Yermegiyayev had no 
history as a party activist.  His demotion was seen by some 
local analysts as part of a Nazarbayev strategy to mobilize 
the rank and file; Yermegiyayev was thought to be too much 
of a functionary to carry out that role.  (Note: 
Tuyakbay\'s subsequent resignation likely upset the overall 
strategy, however.)  Yermegiyayev, one of eight children, 
was born June 14, 1944 in the village of Jalanash in Alma- 
Ata Oblast.  He graduated from Moscow\'s V. Kuybyshev Civil 
Engineering Institute in 1968 with a degree in industrial 
and civil construction.  After military service, he worked 
in the construction industry until 1988, when he was 
appointed Deputy Chairman of the Executive Committee of the 
Almaty City Soviet of People\'s Deputies.  He returned to 
the private sector in 1990 as president of the 
Almatykurylys construction holding company, a position he 
still holds.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EFIN, PGOV, PHUM, KZ, 2005 Election, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL 
SUBJECT: KAZAKHSTAN: DEATH OF PROMINENT BANKER SPARKS RUMORS 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The December 19 death of Bank TuranAlem 
(BTA) president Erzhan Tatishev in a hunting accident has 
put the local rumor mill into high gear.  Despite calming 
words from representatives of the bank, the second largest 
in Kazakhstan, the accident has received a great deal of 
media attention and spawned even more speculation.  Three 
theories compete as the \"true\" cause behind the death: 
hunting accident; elimination by economic rivals; and 
politically-motivated killing.  Controversy, however, 
surrounded Tatishev long before the accident, due to his 
membership in opposition political party Democratic Choice 
of Kazakhstan (DCK) and his ties with exiled DCK leader 
Mukhtar Ablyazov.  The results of a criminal investigation, 
standard procedure in such deaths, will probably due little 
to convince skeptics.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) On Sunday, December 19, Tatishev was killed in a 
hunting accident in Zhambyl Oblast, about 260 kilometers 
east of Almaty.  According to a preliminary police 
investigation Tatishev was allegedly shot in an accidental 
discharge while trying to pass a 12-gauge shotgun to a 
passenger.  Supposedly, the passenger wanted to shoot wolves 
passing in the distance. 
 
------------------------------ 
The Official Version of Events 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) Police, at least until they finish their 
investigation, and bank officials claim no foul play. 
Within hours of Tatishev\'s death, a special session of the 
BTA Board of Directors appointed Deputy Chairman of the 
Board, Saduakas Mameshtegi, acting Chairman.  At a December 
20 press conference, BTA Chairman of Board of Directors 
Ualiev said that he and the board \"completely exclude any 
political motivation\" behind the tragedy.  Furthermore, he 
rejected business rivalry as the cause behind the death: \"Of 
course he had rivals and those who thought ill of them, but 
we cannot and do not want to link that with this tragedy.\" 
In a further statement, the bank vowed to adhere to its 
present business strategy. 
 
4. (U) Police, for the present, are investigating the 
incident as negligence, not as a murder or conspiracy. 
Authorities are conducting their investigation under Article 
101, para. 1 \"Causing death through negligence.\" 
 
5. (SBU) Nevertheless, both friends and colleagues are 
baffled by the sheer negligence that allegedly led to the 
death.  Colleagues of the deceased told Kazinform, a state 
news agency, that Tatishev was an experienced hunter who 
spent every free weekend hunting.  In addition, a 
representative of a Western bank in Kazakhstan, who had 
hunted with Tatishev, thought such an accident highly 
unlikely.  He told Econoff that Tatishev handled weapons 
safely and professionally.  According to the Western banker, 
it was unlikely Tatishev would have been so reckless in 
handling a loaded firearm. 
 
------------------------- 
Eliminating a Competitor? 
------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Various print sources claim that business rivals 
removed Tatishev because of the growing presence of BTA. 
The web paper \"Navi.Kz\" writes that, \"its expansion.in the 
CIS could not but put the banking structures of the CIS on 
their guard.\"  Under Tatishev, BTA became a leading bank in 
Kazakhstan and expanded its activities throughout the CIS. 
In addition to existing branches in Moscow, Kiev, Minsk, 
Bishkek and Shanghai, BTA also plans to open offices in 
Yekaterinburg, Kazan, Chisinau, Baku and Dushanbe.  On 
December 16, Tatishev initiated a multi-million dollar 
financing deal with Leningrad Oblast. 
 
7. (U) Tatishev owned 24% of BTA\'s shares, which will now 
apparently be passed to his heirs.  When asked at the press 
conference about future management of TatQhev\'s BTA stake, 
Ualiev said that \"there are some juridical nuances, and 
probably it will be handled via proxy by the bank\'s 
management.\" 
 
------------------------------- 
Eliminating a Political Figure? 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Others point to Tatishev\'s links to opposition 
party Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DCK).  Tatishev had 
long-standing commercial links with Mukhtar Ablyazov, a DCK 
 
founder, former Minister of Energy and Industry (1998-99), 
and businessman. In 2002, Ablyazov was charged with misusing 
his post as Minister and later convicted in what most 
observers viewed as a politically-motivated case.   In a 
recent broadcast, Kazakhstan state television drew a link 
between Ablyazov\'s May 2004 release from prison and BTA\'s 
subsequent increase in activity such as expansion in the 
CIS.  In 2002, Tatishev broke with DCK, saying that 
participation in a political party was inappropriate for a 
professional businessman.  On December 2, 2004, the BTA 
Chairman, together with the heads of six other banks, signed 
a statement that the banking sector should not be involved 
into politics. 
9. (SBU) Controversy and rumors swirled around Tatishev even 
before his death.  In May 2003, the sensationalist 
Kompromat.ru web site reported that Tatishev had absconded 
to the U.S. with the bank\'s funds.  BTA denied the rumor, 
stating that the Chairman was on a business trip to the U.S. 
The rumor\'s authors linked Tatishev\'s trip with the early 
release of Ablyazov.  In addition, an attempt was made on 
the banker\'s life in June 2002 when gunmen attacked his 
official car.  Fortunately for Tatishev, he was not in the 
car at the time.  Following the incident, police theorized 
the attack had been due to political motives. 
10. (SBU) Comment:  Given the penchant here for conspiracy 
theories, even the results of the official investigation are 
unlikely to clear the air around Tatishev\'s death. Few in 
Kazakhstan, however, believe the accident to have been the 
result of a brief moment of bad judgment.  The alleged 
circumstances of the accident - passing a loaded shotgun 
while driving a jeep - are close to incomprehensible, 
particularly in light of Tatishev\'s renown as a hunter.  The 
fate of BTA and of Tatishev\'s 24% share will, most likely, 
prove the best explanation to his untimely death.  End 
comment.
