SUBJECT: EVENING STANDARD ARTICLE ON US CAPTIVES IN 
LEBANON 
 
REF: RAPHEL/STANTON TELCON 31985 
 
1.  PARAGRAPH 2 CONTAINS ARTICLE FROM THE STANDARD OF 
MARCH 19, 1985 ENTITLED \"TORTURE ORDEAL OF KIDNAPPED 
US DIPLOMAT\".  THE ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN BY THEODORE 
LEVITE IN TEL AVIV. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT:  AN AMERICAN DIPLOMAT KIDNAPPED BY LEBANESE 
EXTREMISTS IS BEING PARADED AROUND THE COUNTRY IN AN OPEN 
TRUCK AND PUBLICLY TORTURED AND HUMILIATED. 
 
THE MAN SAID BY THE KIDNAPPERS TO BE THE HEAD OF THE CIA 
IN BEIRUT, WAS SEIZED LAST MARCH BY THE FANATICAL SHI\'ITE 
HIZBOLLAH ORGANIZATION. 
 
THE CIA CARAVAN--AS THE KIDNAPPERS CALL IT--GOES FROM ONE 
SHI\'ITE VILLAGE TO ANOTHER IN LEBANONS BEKA\'A VALLEY 
ATTRACTING HUGE JEERING CROWDS WHILE THE PRIZE HOSTAGE IS 
FORCED TO TAKE PART IN THE \"SHOW\". 
 
SHI\'ITE SOURCES IN SOUTH LEBANON REPORTING THE STORY POINT 
OUT THAT HIZBOLLAH IS TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY IRAN AND ACTS 
ONLY ON ITS DIRECT ORDERS. 
 
THE ORGANIZATION HAS ADMITTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WEEK- 
END KIDNAPPING OF TWO BRITONS AND THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BUREAU CHIEF IN BEIRUT MR. TERRY ANDERSON. 
 
-- 
 
THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE CAUSED THE 
U.S. GOVERNMENT HURRIEDLY TO EVACUATE THE REMAINING 
AMERICAN DIPLOMATS FROM BEIRUT TO CYPRUS. 
 
THE HIZBOLLAH GROUP IS BELIEVED TO BE CURRENTLY HOLDING 
FIVE AMERICANS, TWO BRITONS, AND SEVERAL OTHER FOREIGNERS. 
 
UNITED NATIONS SOURCES IN SOUTH LEBANON POINT OUT THAT 
IT IS THE SHI\'ITE FANATICS WHO PRESENT THEIR HOSTAGE AS 
A CIA CHIEF--SOMETHING THE AMERICANS HAVE NEVER ADMITTED 
BEYOND CONFIRMING THAT ONE OF THEIR DIPLOMATS IN BEIRUT 
IS MISSING, BELIEVED TO BE HELD HOSTAGE. 
 
THE KIDNAPPED AMERICAN IS THOUGHT TO BE MR. WILLIAM 
BUCKLEY, A POLITICAL OFFICER AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BEIRUT. 
 
HE WAS SEIZED IN WEST BEIRUT NEAR HIS EMBASSY WHEN HE WAS 
FORCED INTO A WHITE CAR AND DRIVEN AWAY AT GUN-POINT. 
 
A VIDEO FILM RELEASED IN JANUARY SHOWED HIM AND TWO OTHER 
KIDNAPPED AMERICANS, MR. JEREMY LEVIN AND MR. BENJAMIN 
WEIR.

MEANWHILE ISRAEL WAS PREPARING A TOUGH NEW DEFENCE LINE ON 
ITS BORDER WITH LEBANON TODAY, AIMED AT PREVENTING 
TERRORIST INCURSIONS AFTER THE ARMY WITHDRAWS. 
 
MILITARY CHIEFS SAY THE WITHDRAWAL COULD COME AS QUICKLY 
AS JUNE DESPITE OFFICIAL ESTIMATES THAT ISRAELI SOLDIERS 
WILL BE OUT OF LEBANON BY SEPTEMBER. 
 
ARMY ENGINEERS ARE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT IN THE NEW DEFENCE 
LINE, MOST OF THE DETAILS OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY SECRET. 
 
ONE OFFICER SAID, \"WE\'RE NOT BUILDING A GREAT WALL OF 
CHINA, BUT OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT NO MADMEN DRIVING A 
CAR BOMB WILL BE ABLE TO GET INTO ISRAEL.\"

SUBJECT:  URBAN VIOLENCE IN BRITAIN -- THE CHALLENGE 
          OF A RACIAL UNDERCLASS WORRIES THIS 
          CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  DEPRESSED AREAS IN SEVERAL OF THE 
U.K.\'S INNER CITIES ERUPTED IN RIOTS IN THE PAST 
MONTH.  THE BRITISH SEE MANY OF THEIR DOMESTIC WOES 
THROWN INTO HIGH RELIEF BY THE RIOTS AND THE 
SUBSEQUENT NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT CAUSE, EFFECT, AND 
WHO IS TO BLAME.  THE RIOTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED: 
 
--- THE LONG-TERM ECONOMIC MALAISE IN BRITAIN, WITH A 
HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND A NEAR-COLLAPSE OF THE 
SMOKE-STACK INDUSTRIES IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND; 
 
--- RACIAL TENSION BETWEEN WHITE BRITAIN AND THE 
BLACK AND ASIAN POPULATIONS WHO HAVE SETTLED IN THE 
U.K. SINCE THE 1950\'S; 
 
--- PERSISTENT PROBLEMS OF SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE IN 
AREAS OF THE INNER CITY, WHICH EXTEND TO HOUSING, 
EDUCATION, INCOME, AND EMPLOYMENT; 
 
--- A VIGOROUS NEW DRUG CRACKDOWN WHICH IS 
INADVERTENTLY THREATENING THE UNEASY BALANCE BETWEEN 
POLICE AND COMMUNITIES IN MANY INNER CITY AREAS; 
 
--- THE PROBLEM OF POLICING THE MULTI-ETHNIC INNER 
CITIES EFFECTIVELY AND SENSITIVELY WITH A NEARLY 
ALL-WHITE POLICE FORCE WHICH IS FACING NUMEROUS 
POLITICAL PRESSURES AT PRESENT; 
 
--- THE LACK OF AN AGREED RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEM ON 
THE PART OF BRITAIN\'S NATIONAL POLITICAL LEADERS. 
 
ALL THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE RIOTS ARE AND 
HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN THE U.S., AND IN GREATER 
MEASURE, AND THE RIOT DESTRUCTION HERE IS ON A MUCH 
SMALLER SCALE THAN IT WAS IN THE U.S. URBAN UPHEAVALS 
OF TWO DECADES AGO. THE AMERICAN RESPONSE (EEO 
LEGISLATION, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, GIVING MINORITIES 
GREATER AVENUES FOR POLITICAL EXPRESSION) RESULTED IN 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SOCIETAL STRUCTURE AND 
POLITICS IN THE U.S.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER 
THE BRITISH POLITICAL SYSTEM WILL PROVE FLEXIBLE 
ENOUGH TO MEET THE CHALLENGE THIS UNREST POSES.  WITH 
THE AUTUMN CHILL COMING, THE RIOTS MAY HAVE ABATED, 
BUT WHEN THE WEATHER GETS WARM AGAIN, IF NOT BEFORE, 
THERE COULD BE A REPEAT OF THESE INCIDENTS.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
ARE THEY DEPRESSED BECAUSE THEY\'RE DEPRIVED? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  HEADLINES IN THE U.K. IN THE PAST MONTH HAVE 
RECORDED CLASHES BETWEEN RIOTERS AND POLICE, THE 
KNIFING TO DEATH OF ONE POLICEMAN, AND CROWDS OF 
YOUTHS PELTING BRICKS, STONES, AND MOLOTOV COCKTAILS 
AT RIOT-SHIELDED POLICE IN THE DEPRESSED AREAS OF 
LONDON, BIRMINGHAM, LIVERPOOL, AND LEICESTER. FOUR 
YEARS AGO, AFTER SIMILAR SCENES IN THE BRIXTON 
NEIGHBORHOOD OF LONDON, LORD SCARMAN, THE JUDGE WHO 
HEADED A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY, FOUND THAT THE 
PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF THE RIOTS WERE: UNEMPLOYMENT, 
POOR HOUSING, LACK OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
PROSPECTS FOR YOUTHS, POOR RELATIONS BETWEEN THE 
COMMUNITY AND THE POLICE, AND AN INCREASINGLY LARGE 
NUMBER OF BLACKS WHO FELT ANGRY AND ALIENATED FROM A 
SOCIETY WHICH THEY PERCEIVED AS RACIST AND HOSTILE. 
 
4.  THE RIOT AREAS ARE SHARPLY MORE ETHNIC AND 
YOUNGER THAN THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE. THE OVERALL 
PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES HEADED BY A WEST INDIAN, 
INDIAN, OR PAKISTANI IN BRITAIN IS 4.7 PERCENT, BUT 
IN THE HANDSWORTH AREA OF BIRMINGHAM, THE FIGURE IS 
53.1 PERCENT. THERE IS ALSO A CONCENTRATION OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE IN THE RIOT AREAS; THE PERCENTAGE OF THE 
POPULATION THAT IS BETWEEN 16 AND 24 IN HANDSWORTH IS 
CLOSE TO 40 PERCENT, WHEREAS IN BRITAIN AS A WHOLE IT 
IS ABOUT HALF THAT. 
 
5.  MUCH OF THE SITUATION IN THE INNER CITIES WHICH 
SCARMAN POINTED TO AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE RIOTS OF 
1981 HAS NOT CHANGED. IN FACT, THE PAST FEW YEARS 
HAVE SEEN THIS PICTURE GROW BLEAKER.  UNEMPLOYMENT 
FIGURES IN HANDSWORTH STAND AT OVER 30 PERCENT, AND 
IN TOXTETH IN LIVERPOOL, ANOTHER RIOT SITE, AT 47 
PERCENT. 
 
6.  THE INNER CITIES HAVE THE HIGHEST NATIONAL RATES 
OF MENTAL HOSPITAL ADMISSION IN BRITAIN, THE HIGHEST 
PERCENTAGE OF SINGLE-PARENT HOMES (TWICE THE NATIONAL 
AVERAGE) AND THE MOST HOUSES DECLARED UNFIT FOR HUMAN 
HABITATION.  FOR MANY THE PROSPECTS FOR ESCAPING 
UNEMPLOYMENT SEEM INCREASINGLY NON-EXISTENT; THE 
RATIO OF VACANCIES LISTED TO PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED WAS 1 
TO 8 IN THE INNER CITIES IN THE DAYS OF THE FIRST 
BRIXTON DISTURBANCES, BUT THE FIGURE IS NOW 1 TO 491, 
ACCORDING TO A SEPTEMBER ARTICLE IN THE LONDON TIMES. 
JUNE FIGURES IN TOXTETH WERE 10,000 INQUIRIES FOR 126 
VACANCIES. 
 
IS THERE AN UNDERCLASS? 
------------------------ 
 
7.  A CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE, HARD-CORE 
UNEMPLOYMENT, AND DISINTEGRATION OF THE SOCIAL FABRIC 
IN THE INNER CITIES IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM IN BRITAIN: 
DICKENS DESCRIBED THE SQUALOR, OVER-CROWDING, AND 
POVERTY IN BRITAIN\'S CITIES OVER A CENTURY AGO. WHAT 
HAS CHANGED IS THAT THE PEOPLE AFFECTED ARE 
INCREASINGLY LIKELY TO BE MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS. 
PARTICIPANTS IN THE RECENT RIOTS WERE BOTH BLACK AND 
WHITE, AND STILL MANY OF THE POOREST PEOPLE IN 
BRITAIN ARE WHITE, BUT THE NUMBER OF MINORITIES WHO 
ARE \"AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HEAP\" IS VASTLY OUT OF 
PROPORTION TO THEIR TOTAL NUMBERS IN THE POPULATION. 
 
8.  NATIONWIDE, THERE ARE STRIKING DIFFERENCES IN THE 
EXPERIENCES OF WHITES AND MINORITIES IN HOUSING, 
EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME.  A STUDY RELEASED 
LAST MONTH BY THE POLICY STUDY INSTITUTE, A 
WELL-RESPECTED GROUP, REVEALED THAT BLACKS AND ASIANS 
IN BRITAIN ARE ON AVERAGE FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY AS 
WHITES TO BE PASSED OVER FOR JOBS FOR WHICH THEY 
APPLY, A STATISTIC WHICH CANNOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY 
DIFFERENCES IN EDUCATION OR TRAINING.  WITH 
COMPARABLE EDUCATION, THE SAME DIFFERENCE PERTAINS. 
AMONG PEOPLE WITH ONE OR MORE \"O\" LEVELS (ABOUT THE 
EQUIVALENT OF A U.S. HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA) THE 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 9 PERCENT FOR WHITES, 18 PERCENT 
FOR ASIANS, AND 25 PERCENT FOR BLACKS. THE PROSPECTS 
FOR THOSE WITHOUT THESE QUALIFICATIONS, AND IN AREAS 
THAT HAVE BEEN HIT HARDEST ECONOMICALLY, ARE EVEN 
BLEAKER. 
 
9.  BIRMINGHAM, THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN BRITAIN 
AND UNTIL 15 YEARS AGO THE SECOND WEALTHIEST WHEN 
MEASURED BY AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME, IS NOW THE 
POOREST CITY IN THE U.K. IT LOST 1/3 OF ITS 
MANUFACTURING JOBS BETWEEN 1978 AND 1984, ACCORDING 
TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES REGIONAL SURVEY. IN THAT SORT 
OF ECONOMIC CLIMATE, BREAKING INTO THE JOB MARKET IS 
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE, AND OF THOSE WHO LEFT SCHOOL AT 16 
LAST SUMMER, ONLY 18 PERCENT OF WHITES, 16 PERCENT OF 
ASIANS, AND 5 PERCENT OF BLACKS HAD FOUND WORK AT THE 
END OF 6 MONTHS, ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF 
EMPLOYMENT. 
 
10.  LIVERPOOL SIMILARLY HAS DECLINED DRASTICALLY IN 
RECENT YEARS. ACCORDING TO A SERIAL CASE STUDY OF THE 
AREA PUBLISHED IN THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER, THERE WERE 
11,000 DOCKWORKERS EMPLOYED IN THE PORT OF LIVERPOOL 
IN 1972, BUT TODAY THERE ARE FEWER THAN 2,000. 
INDUSTRIAL PLANTS IN TOXTETH EMPLOYED 22,000 THAT 
YEAR, BUT NOW EMPLOY 2,000. UNEMPLOYMENT FOR 
LIVERPOOL AS A WHOLE IS 21 PERCENT, BUT IN CERTAIN 
POCKETS SUCH AS TOXTETH, THE RATE IS AT 70 PERCENT 
FOR ADULTS AND 96 PERCENT FOR YOUTHS.  FOUR-FIFTHS OF 
TOXTETH\'S CITIZENS RECEIVE SOME WELFARE BENEFITS. 
CLEARLY IT IS NOT ONLY NON-WHITES WHO FACE MAJOR 
OBSTACLES, BUT IT IS THE NON-WHITES WHO ARE MOST APT 
TO FIND THEMSELVES STYMIED AS MEMBERS OF AN ECONOMIC 
AND RACIAL UNDERCLASS. 
 
11.  DIFFERENCES IN HOUSING BETWEEN BLACKS AND WHITES 
ARE STRIKING. ACCORDING TO THE POLICY STUDIES 
INSTITUTE\'S COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY \"BLACK AND WHITE 
BRITAIN\", BLACK HOUSEHOLDS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS 
WHITES TO SHARE A DWELLING. FOUR TIMES AS MANY ASIANS 
AND THREE TIMES AS MANY WEST INDIANS AS WHITES LIVE 
IN OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS, DEFINED AS TWO OR MORE 
PEOPLE TO A BEDROOM. OVER HALF THE PAKISTANI-HEADED 
FAMILIES IN BRITAIN LIVE IN HOUSES WITHOUT HOT WATER, 
INDOOR TOILETS, AND BATHS, WHEREAS THE FIGURE FOR 
WHITES IS 17 PERCENT. 
 
12.  THERE ARE DEEP DIFFERENCES IN THE MEASURED 
EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS OF WHITES AND 
MINORITIES.  CHILDREN OF WEST INDIAN PARENTS ARE FOUR 
TIMES AS LIKELY AS WHITE CHILDREN TO BE CLASSIFIED AS 
EDUCATIONALLY SUBNORMAL. AND FEW BLACK YOUNGSTERS GO 
BEYOND SECONDARY EDUCATION.  THE PROBLEM, ACCORDING 
TO ONE ANALYST, IS NOT SO MUCH OUTRIGHT 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE BLACK CHILDREN AS 
\"WELL-MEANING LOW EXPECTATION\" ON THE PART OF 
TEACHERS. TEACHERS DECIDE SUBCONSCIOUSLY THAT THE 
CHILDREN ARE LIKELY TO BE FAILURES AND GIVE UP ON 
THEM, LEAVING THEM TO MARK TIME IN REMEDIAL EDUCATION 
UNTIL THEY CAN LEAVE SCHOOL AT 16. 
 
13.  THE AVERAGE WAGE FOR BLACKS IN BRITAIN REMAINS 
20 POUNDS LESS PER WEEK THAN FOR WHITES. ASIANS EARN 
18 POUNDS LESS, ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION FOR 
RACIAL EQUALITY, AND THIS STARTS FROM THE LOW 
NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR WHITES OF ONLY 139 POUNDS PER 
WEEK. 
 
14.  FROM BEHIND THESE STATISTICS EMERGES A PICTURE 
OF AN ALIENATED THIRD-WORLD NATION WITHIN BRITAIN, AN 
UNDER-CLASS OF THE DEPRIVED, THE HOPELESS, AND THE 
DISPOSSESSED, IN LARGE PART BUT BY NO MEANS ENTIRELY 
MADE UP OF MINORITES. 
 
WHO ARE THE RACIAL MINORITIES? 
------------------------------- 
 
15.  UNTIL RECENTLY, MOST IN THE U.K. BELIEVED THEY 
LIVED IN A RACIALLY HOMOGENEOUS SOCIETY. BRITONS 
LOOKED ON RELATIVELY COMPLACENTLY WHILE AMERICA 
STRUGGLED WITH RACIAL ISSUES IN THE 1960\'S: \"WE DON\'T 
HAVE SUCH TROUBLES HERE\". THE ONE ACERBIC EXCEPTION 
CAME IN 1968, WHEN ENOCH POWELL, A CONSERVATIVE M.P., 
MADE A NOTORIOUS SPEECH IN WHICH HE PREDICTED \"RIVERS 
OF BLOOD\" IN THE STREETS IF THE TIDE OF ASIAN AND 
AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS WAS NOT STEMMED. HOWEVER CRUDELY 
AND UNACCEPTABLY TO MOST OF HIS AUDIENCE, HE HAD PUT 
HIS FINGER ON A PROBLEM; BRITAIN APPEARS UNPREPARED 
TO DEAL WITH THE PROFOUND CHANGE IN THE COMPLEXION OF 
ITS SOCIETY WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY AN INFLUX 
OF IMMIGRANTS. THEY CAME FROM THE COMMONWEALTH AT 
FIRST, AND WERE FOLLOWED BY IMMIGRANTS RECRUITED FROM 
THE CARIBBEAN TO FILL WORLD WAR II LABOR SHORTAGES. 
IMMIGRATION GREW AS TROUBLES AFFLICTED ONE 
POST-COLONIAL TERRITORY AFTER ANOTHER IN THE 50\'S AND 
60\'S. THOSE WHO WANTED TO MOVE COULD USE THEIR 
COMMONWEALTH PASSPORTS, A POSSIBILITY WHICH WAS 
REDUCED BY CHANGES IN THE LAW IN THE LAST DECADE. 
 
16.  STILL, THERE ARE ONLY ONE MILLION BLACKS AND 
BROWNS IN BRITAIN, OUT OF A POPULATION OF 54 MILLION, 
AND BY NOW HALF OF THESE ARE BRITISH-BORN. BUT THEIR 
OUTSIDER STATUS PERSISTS. THEY ARE STILL 
DISPROPORTIONATELY STUCK AT THE THE LOWER END OF THE 
PAY SCALE, IN SHIFTWORK AND PART-TIME WORK. OF THOSE 
IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR CHILDREN IN THE U.K. WHO HAVE 
FOUND WORK, 50 PERCENT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 
OVERQUALIFIED EDUCATIONALLY FOR THE WORK THEY DO, 
ACCORDING TO THE BOOK \"STAYING POWER: A HISTORY OF 
BLACK PEOPLE IN BRITAIN\", BY PETER FRYER. 
 
17.  BRITAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRATIFIED SOCIETY, 
WITH EACH NEW GENERATION INHERITING THE 
CHARACTERISTICS AND ATTITUDES THAT PRESERVED THE 
CLASS STRUCTURE AND ITS OWN PLACE WITHIN IT. AS SUCH 
IT WAS ILL-PREPARED TO IMPORT AND ASSIMILATE MILLIONS 
WHO WERE OUTSIDE OF THIS FAMILIAR WORLD ORDER, AND 
WHO IN MANY CASES HAD THEIR OWN CULTURAL TRADITIONS 
AND DID NOT ASPIRE TO SLIDE HORIZONTALLY INTO THE 
BRITISH SYSTEM. MANY BRITONS FEAR THE CONFUSING 
CHANGES THAT THE IMMIGRANTS HAVE HELPED BRING INTO 
THEIR FORMERLY BOUNDED AND ORDERLY WORLD. THEY VIEW 
THE NEW-COMERS WITH SUSPICION AND WORSE. 
 
18.  POPULAR PRESS REPORTING OF THE RECENT RIOTS HAS 
REFLECTED THE RABBLE-ROUSING RACISM WHICH IS STILL 
EASY DISCOURSE IN MODERN BRITAIN.  TABLOIDS DESCRIBE 
THE \"ZULU-STYLE WAR CRIES\" OF THE RIOTERS AND 
RE-CYCLE THE COMMENTS OF WHITES CALLING THEM 
\"BARBARIANS\" AND \"ANIMALS\". BUT LIFE IS NOT SO 
SIMPLE; AT LEAST A QUARTER OF THE YOUTHS IN THE MOB 
AT TOTTENHAM, AND ONE HALF OF THOSE WHO APPEARED 
BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE SUBSEQUENTLY, WERE ESTIMATED TO 
BE WHITE. BOTH BLACK AND WHITE YOUTHS ARE NOW CHARGED 
WITH THE MURDER OF THE POLICE CONSTABLE AT TOTTENHAM. 
THE PUBLIC HOUSING NEAR MOST OF THE RIOT LOCALES IS 
MORE INTEGRATED THAN WAS THE CASE IN THE U.S. IN THE 
60\'S; BROADWATER FARMS, THE PUBLIC HOUSING 
DEVELOPMENT AT THE CENTER OF THE RIOTS IN LONDON\'S 
TOTTENHAM AREA, HOLDS APPROXIMATELY A 50/50 RACIAL 
MIX. 
 
19.  IN ADDITION TO THE DIFFICULTY THE LARGER WHITE 
POPULATION IS HAVING IN ABSORBING IMMIGRANT 
POPULATIONS (THERE IS NO \'MELTING POT\' TRADITION IN 
BRITAIN), THERE ARE TENSIONS BETWEEN RACIAL GROUPS 
AMONG THE IMMIGRANTS.  THE TWO GROUPS WHICH HAVE 
IMMIGRATED IN THE LARGEST NUMBERS ARE ASIANS 
(PRIMARILY INDIANS AND PAKISTANIS) AND AFRO- 
CARRIBEANS. THE BLACK IMMIGRANTS ARE SAID TO RESENT 
THE RELATIVELY MORE PROSPEROUS ASIANS. THE ASIANS, 
WHO TEND TO BE THE ONLY SHOPKEEPERS LEFT IN THE INNER 
CITIES, HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD HIT BY THE LOOTING 
AND BURNING THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE DURING THE RIOTS. 
THE ONLY TWO CIVILIAN FATALITIES AS THE RESULT OF THE 
RIOTING HAVE BEEN TWO ASIAN BROTHERS, KILLED WHEN 
THEIR STORE IN HANDSWORTH WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND 
AFTER THEY WERE LOCKED IN.  PRESS ACCOUNTS NOTED THAT 
THEIR STORE WAS THE PLACE THAT MOST OF THE LOCAL 
RESIDENTS CASHED THEIR WELFARE CHECKS, AND THUS TO 
SOME OF THE RIOTERS THE STORE MAY HAVE SYMBOLIZED THE 
SYSTEM AGAINST WHICH THEY WERE LASHING OUT. 
 
20.  IT IS PERHAPS POSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE RIVALRY 
BETWEEN ETHNIC GROUPS IN BRITAIN. THIS RIVALRY DOES 
HAVE PARALLELS IN U.S. CITIES, SUCH AS THE RESENTMENT 
CERTAIN BLACKS EXPRESSED AGAINST CUBANS IN THE MIAMI 
RIOTS, AND IT HAS SIMILAR CAUSES. 
 
21.  BLACKS COMPLAIN THAT THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE 
GIVEN WHAT FEW FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS 
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CITIES. (SINCE 1981 CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT HAS ALLOCATED ONLY 200,000 POUNDS FOR THIS 
PURPOSE TO THE RIOT AREA OF HANDSWORTH, IN SPITE OF 
THE SCARMAN REPORT, WHICH EMPHASIZED HOW EFFECTIVE 
SUCH GRANTS WOULD BE IN REHABILITATING THE RIOT 
AREAS.) THESE COMPLAINTS ARE SUPPORTED BY STATISTICS; 
OVER 50 PERCENT OF APPLICATIONS FOR GRANTS FOR SMALL 
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT (INNER CITY PARTNERSHIPS) WERE 
SUBMITTED BY BLACKS, BUT THEY ULTIMATELY RECEIVED 
ONLY 13 PERCENT OF THE GRANTS. ASIAN BUSINESSES 
FOUNDED WITH THESE GRANTS ARE ALMOST INVARIABLY 
FAMILY OPERATED AND RARELY EMPLOY BLACKS. 
 
22.  THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A BLACK MIDDLE 
CLASS IN BRITAIN. THE ONLY ROLE MODELS THAT BLACK 
PEOPLE HAVE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT ARE MUSICIANS, 
SPORTS FIGURES, AND A HANDFUL OF T.V. JOURNALISTS, AS 
THERE ARE NO NATIONAL LEADERS, NO MEMBERS OF 
PARLIAMENT, AND ONLY ONE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEADER WHO 
IS BLACK (AND EVEN HE WAS NOT ELECTED DIRECTLY IN THE 
STYLE OF U.S. MAYORS). ASIANS, BY CONTRAST, DO HAVE 
ROLE MODELS IN BUSINESS AND COMMERCE, AND THEY HAVE 
THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. THUS, 
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT FULLY ACCEPTED INTO BRITISH 
SOCIETY, ON THE WHOLE ASIANS ARE \"PART OF THE 
SYSTEM\", AS ONE OBSERVER PUT IT. 
 
THE POLICE: ARE THEY THE PROBLEM OR THE ANSWER? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
23.  THE ROLE OF THE POLICE, AND THE RISING PRESSURES 
ON THEM TO RESPOND TO SUCCESSIVE SOCIETAL CHALLENGES 
IS WORRISOME TO MANY HERE.  FIRST IRA TERRORISM, THEN 
POLICING THE MINERS\' STRIKE, AND NOW THE INNER CITY 
STRIFE HAVE STRETCHED THEM DANGEROUSLY THIN. 
MEANWHILE, THE POLICE FORCES WHICH ARE NOW BEING 
ASKED TO CONTAIN THE URBAN UPHEAVALS ARE OFTEN LESS 
THAN ONE PER CENT BLACK OR ASIAN (OVERALL, 700 
MINORITY POLICE OUT OF A FORCE OF 120,000, ACCORDING 
TO NEWSPAPER SOURCES. LAST YEAR, HOWEVER, OF 1208 
TRAINEES IN THE LONDON METROPOLITAN POLICE, 36 
BELONGED TO MINORITY GROUPS, A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN 
IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND ABOUT IN PROPORTION TO 
POPULATION. A WELL-PUBLICIZED STUDY PREPARED BY THE 
INSTITUTE FOR RACE RELATIONS FOR THE ROYAL COMMISSION 
ON CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND PUBLISHED IN 1979, 
CHARACTERIZED MANY OF THE POLICE IN BRITAIN AS 
RACIALLY INSENSITIVE, AND ALLEGED THAT MANY OF THEM 
USE DEROGATORY LANGUAGE WHEN REFERRING TO MINORITIES, 
THAT THEY STEREOTYPE BLACKS AS PIMPS AND LAYABOUTS, 
AND THAT THEY CONSISTENTLY APPLY MORE PRESSURE AND 
AGGRESSION IN ENCOUNTERS WITH BLACK CI|IZENS THAN 
THEY WOULD WITH WHITES. THE NEGATIVE IMAGE OF THE 
POLICE THAT THIS STUDY HELPED CREATE IS ONE FACTOR 
THAT MAKES THE PRESENT RECRUITMENT OF MINORITIES INTO 
THE POLICE SO DIFFICULT. 
 
24.  A RECENT BBC TELEVISION PROGRAM COMPARED THIS 
SITUATION TO THAT IN THE NEW YORK POLICE FORCE, IN 
WHICH 40 PERCENT OF LAST YEAR\'S TRAINEES WERE BLACK, 
AS A RESULT OF INTENSIVE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS AND, 
MORE PROFOUNDLY, A RETHINKING OF THE ROLE AND 
RELEVANCE OF THE POLICE IN THE CITIES. NOTHING ON 
THIS SCALE IS CONTEMPLATED HERE, ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE 
BEEN SOME HALF-HEARTED ATTEMPTS TO BOOST RECRUITMENT 
OF MINORITIES, AND THE HOME SECRETARY HAS NOW URGED 
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE TO HIRE MORE BLACKS. 
 
25.  ONE MUST ALSO NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE POLICE 
FORCE HAS BEEN THE ONLY INSTITUTION TO TAKE THE 1981 
SCARMAN REPORT TO HEART, AND REAL CHANGES HAVE 
OCCURRED SINCE THEN. POLICE NOW TAKE TRAINING IN 
CULTURAL SENSITIVITY AND RACE RELATIONS, AND THE 
CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY POLICING (GETTING THE POLICEMAN 
COMFORTABLE AND FAMILIAR WITH THE PEOPLE ON HIS BEAT, 
AND THE PEOPLE USED TO THE PRESENCE OF THE POLICE) 
HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN IMPROVING THE CLIMATE ON THE 
STREETS. PERHAPS IT IS IRONIC THEN, THAT IT WAS 
POLICE ACTIONS IN TWO INSTANCES WHICH APPEAR TO HAVE 
SPARKED THE RIOTS. THE FIRST WAS THE ACCIDENTAL 
SHOOTING IN SEPTEMBER OF A MIDDLE-AGED BLACK WOMAN, 
OCCASIONED WHEN POLICE BROKE DOWN THE DOOR OF HER 
HOUSE AND BURST IN, LOOKING FOR HER SON ON A WEAPONS 
CHARGE. THE SHOOTING HAS LEFT HER A PARAPLEGIC, AND 
HAS FOCUSSED RESENTMENT AGAINST WHAT IS SEEN AS 
POLICE HEAVY-HANDEDNESS. THIS INCIDENT WAS FOLLOWED 
CLOSELY BY THE DEATH OF A BLACK WOMAN DURING A SEARCH 
OF HER HOME. ALTHOUGH SHE DIED OF HEART FAILURE, HER 
FAMILY HAS CHARGED THAT THE POLICE WHO WERE 
CONDUCTING THE SEARCH DELIBERATELY IGNORED HER PLEAS 
FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION AND ALLOWED HER TO DIE 
UNNECESSARILY FOR WANT OF AN AMBULANCE. 
 
26.  POLICE HEAVY-HANDEDNESS IS CITED REPEATEDLY AS A 
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE RIOTS. TWO SOCIOLOGISTS 
WHO EXPLORED THE ROLE OF THE POLICE IN THE INNER 
CITIES IN A MONOGRAPH PUBLISHED THIS SUMMER CONCLUDED 
THAT THE POLICE WERE IN FACT CONSTANTLY MAKING THEIR 
PRESENCE FELT TO YOUTHS IN THE HANDSWORTH AREA, BY 
FREQUENTLY STOPPING THEM AND QUESTIONING THEM. THE 
AVERAGE RATE AT WHICH YOUTHS WERE STOPPED FOR 
QUESTIONING WAS FIVE TIMES PER YEAR, FOR BOTH BLACKS 
AND WHITES. WHAT WAS PARTICULARLY STRIKING WAS THAT 
ALTHOUGH THEY WERE STOPPED AT THE SAME RATE, BLACK 
YOUNGSTERS DISTRUSTED THE POLICE MUCH MORE, AND THEIR 
ATTITUDES WERE FAR MORE OFTEN HOSTILE. IT IS 
INEVITABLE THAT POLICE WILL HAVE TO BE ACTIVE IN 
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGH CRIME RATES AND A HIGH 
PERCENTAGE OF YOUTH (THOSE STATISTICALLY MOST LIKELY 
TO COMMIT CRIMES). IT IS JUST AS INEVITABLE THAT 
ENCOUNTERS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CREATE 
STRAINS. BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT MANY BLACKS ARE 
LASHING OUT AT THE POLICE, WHO SYMBOLIZE A SYSTEM 
WHICH THEY FEEL IS HOSTILE TO THEIR INTEREST. 
 
27.  THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE RIOTS HAS BEEN TO 
CALL FOR MORE SWEEPING POLICE POWER, AND 
AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF TEAR GAS AND PLASTIC 
BULLETS IN RIOT CONTROL (THE SAME PLASTIC BULLETS 
WHOSE USE IS BEING SO HOTLY CONTESTED IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND, WHERE THEY HAVE ON SOME RARE OCCASIONS 
CAUSED DEATH).  THE CONSERVATIVES, AS THE \"LAW AND 
ORDER\" PARTY, HAVE MADE THEIR PRINCIPAL RALLYING CRY 
FOR DEALING WITH THE RIOTS A PLEDGE FOR INCREASED 
SUPPORT FOR THE POLICE, UNDER PRESSURE FROM THEIR 
RIGHT AND MUCH OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN BRITAIN, THE 
\"DECENT WORKING PEOPLE.\" 
 
28.  NONETHELESS, THE POLICE HAVE REACTED IN 
FRUSTRATION TO THE CHARGES THAT HAVE BEEN LEVELED 
AGAINST THEM. IN AN EMOTIONALLY CHARGED GATHERING 
LAST WEEK, THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE METROPOLITAN 
BRANCH OF THE POLICE FEDERATION, THE RANK AND FILE 
ACCUSED THEIR LEADERS OF COWARDICE, SAYING THAT THEY 
WERE AFRAID OF MAKING TOUGH DECISIONS FOR FEAR OF 
POLITICAL OR PROMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCES. THE POLICE ON 
THE BEAT COMPLAIN THAT THE BRAKES ARE PUT ON THEM BY 
THEIR SENIOR OFFICERS AND BY LOCAL POLITICIANS. IN 
TOTTENHAM, THE FIRST RIOT IN THE U.K. MAINLAND IN 
WHICH GUNS WERE USED AGAINST THE POLICE, AND WHERE 
ONE POLICEMAN WAS KILLED AND 163 INJURED, THE POLICE 
WERE RESTRAINED FROM GOING INTO THE AREA EARLY ON TO 
MAKE ARRESTS. THIS, POLICE CLAIM, WAS BUT A 
CONTINUATION OF AN OFFICIAL \"HANDS-OFF\" POLICY WHICH 
HAS FRUSTRATED THEM SINCE ITS INCEPTION AFTER 
SCARMAN, AND WHICH THEY BELIEVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE HIGH CASUALTY RATE THAT FOLLOWED. 
 
29.  AT THE MEETING LAST WEEK, JOHN NEWMAN, A 
CONSTABLE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE METROPOLITAN BRANCH OF 
THE POLICE FEDERATION, DEMANDED AND WAS GRANTED A 
\"THOROUGH REVIEW OF POLICY AND TACTICS\" BY 
METROPOLITAN COMMISSIONER SIR KENNETH NEWMAN. 
 
30.  MINORITY AND OPPOSITION LEADERS HAVE COMPLAINED 
THAT THE POLICE ONLY WANT STUDIES OF THE ISSUES THAT 
SUIT THEM, AND NOTE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE 
POLICE HAVE REFUSED TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY 
INTO THE TRIGGERING INCIDENTS OF TWO OF THE RIOTS. 
 
THE POLITICS OF RACE 
--------------------- 
 
31.  THE THEME OF HOME SECRETARY HURD\'S SPEECH AT THE 
ANNUAL CONSERVATIVE CONFERENCE IN EARLY OCTOBER, 
DIRECTED AT MINORITIES, WAS PARAPHRASABLE AS \"YOU 
HAVE THE RIGHTS, NOW EXERCISE SOME RESPONSIBILITY\". 
THE REALITY SEEMS TO BE THAT THESE RIGHTS APPEAR ALL 
TOO THEORETICAL, AT BEST, TO MOST OF BRITAIN\'S 
MINORITIES. 
 
32.  MINORITY VOTERS, ESPECIALLY CARIBBEAN BLACKS, 
HAVE VOTED FOR THE LABOR PARTY SO CONSISTENTLY THAT 
THE CONSERVATIVES AND THE ALLIANCE HAVE LARGELY 
WRITTEN THEM OFF, AND LABOR HAS TAKEN THEM FOR 
GRANTED. 
 
33.  THERE ARE SOME STIRRINGS OF CHANGE. LABOR IS 
GROPING WITH PLANS TO GIVE BLACKS SPECIAL RIGHTS 
WITHIN THE PARTY STRUCTURE, A NUMBER OF ETHNIC ASIANS 
ARE TENDING TOWARDS THE ALLIANCE, AND SOME SUCCESSFUL 
BLACK AND ASIAN BUSINESSMEN FLIRT WITH THE TORIES. 
MEANWHILE, LEGISLATION ON THE U.S. MODEL ALLOWING 
GOVERNMENT TO WITHDRAW CONTRACTS FROM FIRMS THAT DO 
NOT EMPLOY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF MINORITIES WAS 
RECENTLY PROPOSED BY THE HOME OFFICE. THIS PROPOSAL 
IS CONTROVERSIAL AND UNLIKELY TO BECOME LAW BECAUSE 
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FAIRNESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF 
SUCH MEASURES. NEVERTHELESS, THE RIOTS MAY HAVE 
FORCED THE PROBLEMS OF RACIAL MINORITIES BACK NEAR 
THE TOP OF THE AGENDA. ONE JOURNALIST INTERVIEWING AN 
ANGRY YOUTH ON THE STREETS OF HANDSWORTH CALLED THE 
RIOTS POINTLESS, BUT THE YOUNG MAN COUNTERED \"OH, 
YEAH? HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT? SOMETHING WILL BE 
DONE.\" AND HE MAY BE RIGHT. 
 
PARTY POLITICS: TOO LITTLE DONE, AND THAT TOO LATE 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
34.  THE BROAD REACTION AMONG CONSERVATIVES TO THE 
RECENT RIOTS WAS SPLIT: THE HARD-LINE GOVERNMENT 
SUPPORTERS RESISTED CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS LINKING 
POVERTY AND DEPRIVATION WITH THE URBAN UPHEAVALS AND 
DESCRIBED THE RIOTS AS MERE \"CRIMINAL OPPORTUNISM\". 
THIS POSITION WAS PORTRAYED BY THE OPPOSITION AS A 
SELF-INTERESTED ATTEMPT BY THE TORIES TO WRIGGLE FREE 
OF THEIR PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BRITAIN\'S 
CONTINUING ECONOMIC DOLDRUMS AND THEIR RESULTS. OTHER 
MORE LIBERAL TORIES PARTIALLY CONCURRED WITH THESE 
SENTIMENTS; THEY CLAIMED THAT THE RIOTS PROVED WHAT 
THEY HAD BEEN SAYING, I.E. THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
PRIORITIES HAD TO BE RE-EXAMINED AND THE HARD LINE 
REVISED. PRIME MINISTER THATCHER\'S ARGUMENT THAT THE 
WORKINGS OF AN UNFETTERED FREE MARKET WILL, IF LEFT 
ALONE, CREATE JOBS TO RENEW BRITAIN HAS BEEN 
RIDICULED BY THE OPPOSITION PARTIES, WHICH ASSERT 
THAT UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES THREATEN BRITAIN\'S CITIES 
WITH HOSTILITY AND ALIENATION THAT LAISSEZ-FAIRE 
ECONOMICS CANNOT RESOLVE. MRS. THATCHER\'S RESPONSE TO 
THE RIOTS WAS TO PLEDGE MORE EQUIPMENT AND MANPOWER 
FOR THE POLICE, BUT HOME SECRETARY HURD HAS ALSO 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE RIOT CAUSES MUST BE TREATED 
TOO. THE OPPOSITION HAS OFFERED NO CONCRETE SOLUTIONS 
OTHER THAN THE PRESERVATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE 
WELFARE STATE, WHILE ALLIANCE AND LABOR LEADERS MUST 
WELCOME THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN POWER 
AND HAVING TO DEFEND THEIR OWN RECORDS IN THE GLARE 
OF THE BURNING CITIES. 
 
35.  THE CONSERVATIVES STRESS THE SIGNS OF ECONOMIC 
UPTURN THAT OCCASIONALLY ARISE, SUCH AS NEW FIRMS 
TAKING UP RESIDENCE IN BIRMINGHAM AND LIVERPOOL. THE 
FIRMS WHICH THEY ARE REFERRING TO DO HAVE A POSITIVE 
EFFECT ON ECONOMIC STATISTICS, BUT IN GENERAL ARE 
HIGH-TECH, CAPITAL-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EMPLOY 
RELATIVELY FEW PEOPLE AND THOSE, HIGHLY SKILLED, 
ACCORDING TO A CONGRESS OF BRITISH INDUSTRIES STUDY. 
THUS THEY HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE INNER CITY 
UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS. 
 
36.  THE TORIES HAVE MADE THE REINING-IN OF LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING ONE OF THEIR PRIME TECHNIQUES FOR 
REDUCING TOTAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING. IN PARTICULAR 
PUBLIC SECTOR CAPITAL BUDGETS HAVE BEEN SEVERELY CUT 
FROM 3.6 BILLION POUNDS IN 1979 TO 2.2 BILLION POUNDS 
IN 1986. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE SALE OF COUNCIL 
HOUSING TO ITS TENANTS, THE PUBLIC HOUSING STOCK HAS 
BEEN REDUCED BY ONE-THIRD DURING A PERIOD IN WHICH 
FUNDS FOR HOUSING RENOVATIONS HAVE NOT INCREASED IN 
REAL TERMS. SCARMAN\'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
IMPROVEMENTS IN HOUSING HAVE BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY 
IGNORED. 
 
37.  EDUCATIONAL REFORMS SUGGESTED BY SCARMAN 
INCLUDED MORE AND BETTER NURSERY EDUCATION, MORE 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN THE NEEDS OF MINORITY 
CHILDREN, PROGRAMS TO TEACH ENGLISH TO IMMIGRANTS, 
AND BETTER LINKS BETWEEN PARENTS AND SCHOOLS. NONE OF 
THESE HAS BEEN FUNDED. IN FACT, ACCORDING TO THE 
FINANCIAL TIMES, DESPITE A STATIC NURSERY-AGE 
POPULATION IN BRITAIN, THE OVERALL CAPITAL SPENDING 
FOR NURSERY EDUCATION HAS FALLEN FROM 41 POUNDS PER 
CAPITA TO 24 POUNDS SINCE 1981. 
 
38.  SCARMAN RECOMMENDED THAT \"POSITIVE 
DISCRIMINATION\" MIGHT BE NEEDED TO REDRESS THE 
EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL GAPS BETWEEN WHITES AND 
MINORITIES. (POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION IS BETTER KNOWN 
IN THE U.S. AS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.) NO CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT ACTION RESULTED FROM THESE SUGGESTIONS, 
ALTHOUGH PROGRAMS WERE ADOPTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN 
SOME AREAS. 
 
WHAT ABOUT THE ROLE OF BRITAIN\'S NEW DRUGS CRACKDOWN? 
 
39.  SEVERAL PAPERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT EFFORTS AFTER 
THE LAST RIOTS TO FORGE LINKS BETWEEN POLICE AND THE 
COMMUNITY BY INCREASING POLICEMEN\'S SENSITIVITY TO 
THE COMMUNITIES THEY PATROL HAVE RESULTED IN THE 
POLICE GOING \"SOFT ON CRIME.\" FOR EXAMPLE, THE POLICE 
ARE IN A DELICATE POSITION WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO 
ENFORCE ANTI-MARIJUANA LAWS IN AFRO-CARIBBEAN 
COMMUNITIES, WHERE RASTAFARIANS SEE MARIJUANA AS AN 
IMPORTANT RITUAL SUBSTANCE. INTERFERENCE WITH THIS 
TRADITION IS LIKELY TO BRING TROUBLE DOWN UPON THE 
HEAD OF THE OFFICER WHO IS SO BOLD AS TO STEP IN. AT 
THE VERY LEAST HE INVITES CHARGES OF CULTURAL 
INSENSITIVITY. MEANWHILE, IN MANY AREAS DRUG SALES 
HAVE BECOME THE ONLY RELIABLE SOURCE OF INCOME AND 
ADVANCEMENT FOR YOUNG BLACK GO-GETTERS. 
 
40.  IN THE PAST YEAR, HOWEVER, THE U.K HAS FOCUSSED 
ON THE DAMAGE WHICH DRUG USAGE AND ITS ATTENDANT 
CORRUPTION CAUSE, MINDFUL OF U.S. PROBLEMS, AND IT IS 
ADOPTING IN A WHOLESALE FASHION U.S. ANTI-DRUG 
TECHNIQUES.  AS PART OF AN OVERALL POLICY WHICH 
INCLUDES LONGER SENTENCES FOR DRUG DEALERS, AND NEW 
TECHNIQUES TO SEIZE PROFITS FROM DRUG SALES, THE 
POLICE HAVE BEEN PRESSED TO CRACK DOWN ON DRUGS, AND 
THIS NEW DRUGS OFFENSIVE MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE 
SPARKS THAT FINALLY KINDLED THE TINDERBOX CITIES. 
BIRMINGHAM\'S RIOTS WERE PRECEDED BY TWO MAJOR RAIDS 
RIGHT IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH WERE SOON TO BE THE 
SCENE OF THE DISTURBANCES. THE HOME OFFICE HAS BEEN 
RELUCTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE 
DRUGS SWEEP AND THE ERUPTION OF THE RIOTS, BUT A 
BRIGHT LABOR M.P. FROM BIRMINGHAM TOLD US, WITHOUT IN 
ANY WAY IMPLYING THAT DRUG DEALERS CAN BE ALLOWED 
FREEDOM TO OPERATE, THAT HE KNOWS THE CONNECTION IS 
EXPLICIT. THUS, IT APPEARS THAT THE POLICE ARE CAUGHT 
ON THE FRONT LINES ENFORCING A NEWLY VIGOROUS AND 
GENERALLY POPULAR ANTI-DRUGS POLICY, BUT ARE ALSO 
TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE IMPACT THAT IT AND OTHER 
SOCIAL PROBLEMS ARE HAVING ON BRITAIN\'S CITIES. 
 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
 
41.  THE RIOTS MAY HAVE FORCED BRITAIN\'S POLITICAL 
LEADERS TO EXAMINE THEMSELVES AND DETERMINE 
SUBSEQUENT ACTION TO REDRESS SOME VERY REAL AND THUS 
FAR INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS.  BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE 
LIKELY TO SEE MORE RIOTING AHEAD, WHICH WILL PUT 
EXTRA STRAINS ON THIS CAUTIOUS, SLOW-TO-CHANGE 
SOCIETY. WHILE THE ONSET OF WINTER MAY INHIBIT STREET 
VIOLENCE, SPRING CANNOT BE FAR BEHIND.

2. OUR FCO COLLEAGUES ARE WATCHING THE UGANDA SITUATION 
WITH GROWING CONCERN, AND THEIR ANALYSIS OF MUSEVENI\'S 
NEGATIVE ROLE VERY MUCH COINCIDES WITH OUR OWN IN 
REFTEL.  THE FCO WAS THOROUGHLY RATTLED BY THE FIGHTING 
IN KAMPALA ON WEDNESDAY MORNING; HOWEVER, THE BRITISH 
WERE SLIGHTLY CHEERED WHEN THE KENYANS INFORMED THEM 
THAT MOI WILL BE MEETING WITH THE NRA IN NAIROBI ON 
FRIDAY TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION. 
 
3. ON THE BRITISH MILITARY ROLE, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE 
OPERATION IS TOTALLY ON HOLD PENDING FURTHER 
DEVELOPMENTS.  THE BRITISH MAJOR GENERAL WHO WOULD HEAD 
THE MILITARY GROUP REMAINS IN NAIROBI. 
 
4. LONRHO CHIEF EXECUTIVE TINY ROWLAND TODAY TOLD US 
THAT MUSEVENI\'S GAME PLAN ON UGANDA REMAINS UNCHANGED. 
ACCORDING TO ROWLAND, MUSEVENI WANTS TO EDGE HIS WAY 
TOWARD POLITICAL DOMINANCE IN THE COUNTRY; HE IS UTTERLY 
CONTEMPTUOUS OF OKELLO, ETC; HE VIEWS THE NAIROBI ACCORD 
SIMPLY AS A REVISED FORMAT FOR CONTINUED POLITICAL 
CONFLICT. 
 
5. ASKED WHETHER MUSEVENI PLANS TO TAKE KAMPALA, ROWLAND 
REPLIED THAT MUSEVENI HAS CONSISTENTLY TOLD HIM HE CAN 
TAKE KAMPALA BUT CANNOT HOLD IT.  THEREFORE, HE WILL NOT 
ACTUALLY MOVE INTO THE CITY.  THE FCO AGREES, BELIEVING 
THAT MUSEVENI WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE TACTIC OF PUTTING 
PRESSURE ON THE CITY AND THEN RELENTING. 
 
6. PRESS REPORTS HERE CONTINUE TO ALLEGE THAT AN 
INCURSION BY ZAIRE FORCES INTO SOUTHWESTERN UGANDA HAS 
OCCURRED IN COOPERATION WITH FORMER AMIN TROOPS.  OUR 
FCO CONTACTS SAY THEY ARE UNABLE TO CONFIRM THAT STORY. 
HOWEVER, \"SOUTH\" MAGAZINE CORRESPONDENT WILLIAM PIKE 
TELLS US THE REPORTS - ACCORDING TO HIS NRA FRIENDS - 
ARE CORRECT, AND THE OPERATION IS DESIGNED TO FORESTALL 
NRA MOVES AGAINST KAMPALA.  (IF SO, IT WOULD APPARENTLY 
INDICATE AN ABOUT-FACE BY MOBUTU ON THE UGANDAN 
SITUATION.) 
 
7. WE PLAN TO PURSUE THESE ISSUES IN OUR FRIDAY MEETING

E.O.12356: N/A 
TAGS:  PREL, MOPS, IR 
SUBJECT:  AFGHANS SELL US STINGERS TO KHOMEINI 
 
1.  THE SUNDAY TIMES CARRIED A STORY ON SEPTEMBER 20 
ALLEGING THAT THE U.S. HAS CUT OFF SUPPLIES OF STINGER 
MISSILES TO THE AFGHAN MUJAHEDEEN BECAUSE SOME OF THE 
REBEL COMMANDERS HAD SOLD STINGERS TO THE IRANIANS FOR 
MONEY AND POLITICAL FAVOR. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT. 
 
AFGHANS SELL US STINGERS TO KHOMEINI 
 
THE UNITED STATES HAS CUT OFF SUPPLIES OF STINGER 
ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES TO AN AFGHAN GUERRILLA GROUP 
AFTER DISCOVERING THAT AT LEAST 16 OF THE WEAPONS WERE 
SOLD BY THE RESISTANCE TO IRAN. 
 
OTHER MUJAHEDDIN LEADERS EMBARRASSED BY THE REVELATION, 
SAID THAT AS A RESULT RESISTANCE TO THE SOVIET-BACKED 
AFGHAN REGIME HAD COLLAPSED IN WESTERN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
THE STINGER, WHICH IS SHOULDER-FIRED AND SIMPLE TO USE, 
IS CONSIDERED BY MILITARY EXPERTS TO HAVE TIPPED THE 
BALANCE OF THE EIGHT-YEAR WAR IN THE MUJAHADDIN\'S 
FAVOUR.  THE UNITED STATES STARTED TO DELIVER LARGE 
NUMBERS OF STINGERS TO AFGHAN REBEL GROUPS LAST YEAR, 
AND THIS LED TO HEAVY LOSSES AMONG AFGHAN AND SOVIET 
HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS. 
 
- 
TWO COMMANDERS FROM THE HEZBI ISLAMI PARTY OF YOUNIS 
KHALIS, ONE OF THE STRONGEST OF THE SEVEN GUERRILLA 
GROUPS, ARE IMPLICATED IN THE SALE.  IT APPARENTLY 
EARNED THEM 10M TOUMANS (ONE MILLION DOLLARS) AND 
IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE REGIME OF AYATOLLAH 
KHOMEINI.  THE GROUP IS THE MOST FUNDAMENTALIST FACTION 
AMONG THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE AND MAINTAINS 
REPRESENTATION IN TEHRAN. 
 
THE COMMANDERS WHO ARE SAID TO HAVE SOLD THE MISSILES, 
MULLAH MAHIULLAH OF NIMROOZ AND MULLAH FAQIR-AHMAD OF 
ANAR DARA, WHO CONTROLS THE KHASH RUD DISTRICT, WERE 
SUPPLIED WITH 36 MISSILES.  THEY DENY HAVING SOLD THE 
WEAPONS AND INSTEAD CLAIM THAT THEY WERE CAPTURED BY 
IRANIANS INSIDE AFGHANISTAN. 
 
THE RESULTING SHORTAGE OF STINGERS IN THE REGION HAS 
PROVED DISASTROUS FOR THE MUJAHEDDIN.  \"NINETY NINE 
PERCENT OF NIMROOZ WAS IN COMMUNIST HANDS,\" SAID AN 
OBSERVER IN THE PAKISTAN BORDER TOWN OF QUETTA.  \"ONLY 
KHASH RUD WAS LEFT.  ALL SUPPLIES TO HERAT HAD TO GO 
THROUGH KHASH RUD, SO IT WAS VITAL TO KEEP THE WAY 
OPEN.  NOW KHASH RUD HAS BEEN BOMBED FLAT AND 
RESISTANCE HAS VIRTUALLY CEASED THERE.\" 
 
WESTERN AFGHANISTAN HAS BEEN CONSIDERED RISKY FOR THE 
US BECAUSE THE AREA MAINTAINS CLOSE HISTORICAL AND 
ETHNIC LINKS WITH NEIGHBOURING IRAN.  MOST OF THE 
AFGHAN SHI\'ITE POPULATION LIVE THERE.  \"COMMANDERS COME 
TO PAKISTAN AND SWEAR ON THE KORAN THAT THEY HAVE NO 
LINKS WITH KHOMEINI.  THEN THEY GO AND SELL WEAPONS. 
WHAT CAN YOU DO?\" ASKED ON OBSERVER.  \"MULLAHS HAVE NO 
SENSE OF NATIONALITY,\" HE ADDED.  \"ANY MUSLIM COUNTRY 
IS THEIR HOME AND THEY CONSIDER IRAN TO BE WAGING JIHAD 
(HOLY WAR) AGAINST IRAQ.\" 
 
MANY LOCAL COMMANDERS ARE BITTER ABOUT THE SALE OF 
STINGERS.  ONLY FOUR COMMANDERS IN THE KANDAHAR AREA, 
AND THREE IN NIMROOZ, ARE KNOWN TO HAVE THE MISSILES. 
EVEN POWERFUL LOCAL COMMANDERS, SUCH AS ABDUL RAZIQ OF 
AFGHANISTAN, HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING THE 
WEAPONS, WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH PAKISTAN. 
UNCOMFIRMED REPORTS EARLIER THIS YEAR MAINTAINED THAT 
THE IRANIANS HAD USED STINGERS TO SHOOT DOWN IRAQI 
AIRCRAFT IN THE GULF WAR.  THE US, WHICH DENIED THESE 
REPORTS, IS CONCERNED THAT THE WEAPONS WILL FALL INTO 
TERRORIST HANDS, OR WILL BE COPIED AND SUPPLIED IN 
LARGE NUMBERS TO OTHER HOSTILE STATES SUCH AS LIBYA. 
 
IN THE FLAT COUNTRY SURROUNDING KANDAHAR, WHICH HAS 
BEEN A MUJAHEDDIN STRONGHOLD, THE NEED FOR 
ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS IS ACUTE.  THE GUERRILLAS TRAVEL 
BY TRUCK ALONG DUST TRACKS AND ARE EASILY SPOTTED BY 
OBSERVATION PLANES FITTED WITH NIGHT-SENSING 
EQUIPMENT.  COMMANDERS AND JOURNALISTS VENTURING TO THE 
WEST HAVE OFTEN FOUND THEMSELVES THE TARGET OF AN 
ORGANISED HUNT.  I ENCOUNTERED FIVE AMBUSHES IN THE 
REGION DURING A THREE-WEEK TRIP.  END TEXT.

REF:  A) LONDON 16351  B) LONDON 5653 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE RECENT ESCALATION OF IRA ATTACKS, 
WHICH HAVE INCLUDED NOT ONLY MORE KILLINGS IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND BUT ALSO BOMBINGS AT UK MILITARY BASES IN 
CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND THE FIRST BOMBING IN BRITAIN 
ITSELF SINCE 1984, HAVE CAUSED HMG TO REEXAMINE ITS 
EFFORTS TO CONTROL IRA TERRORISM.  THE INITIAL PROGNOSIS 
BY OFFICIALS IN LONDON IS THAT THERE IS NOT A GREAT DEAL 
MORE THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE SHORT TERM OTHER THAN TO 
INCREASE ALERT LEVELS AND OTHER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST 
TERRORIST ATTACKS AT MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, KEY 
GOVERNMENT OFFICES, AND OTHER LIKELY IRA TARGETS. 
 
THE IRA MIGHT BE PLANNING ATTACKS DIRECTLY AGAINST OR TO 
COINCIDE WITH CERTAIN UPCOMING EVENTS, INCLUDING THE 
BEGINNING OF THE CORONER\'S INQUEST IN GIBRLATAR INTO THE 
KILLING THERE OF THREE IRA TERRORISTS LAST JANUARY, AND 
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE AT BRIGHTON IN OCTOBER. 
 
THE ATTACKS HAVE NOT WEAKENED THE GOVERNMENT\'S RESOLVE 
TO CONTINUE WITH ITS CURRENT POLICIES, WHICH INCLUDE 
TRYING TO RECTIFY CATHOLIC GRIEVANCES IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND.  THERE HAVE BEEN NEW DEMANDS TO INCREASE UK 
MILITARY FORCES IN ULSTER AND TO REINTRODUCE THE 
PREVENTIVE INTERNMENT OF KNOWN IRA ACTIVISTS; THE 
GOVERNMENT HOPES THESE STEPS WILL NOT BE NECESSARY AND 
FOR NOW HAS NO SUCH PLANS. 
 
UK OFFICIALS ARE PLEASED WITH PROGRESS IN GAINING THE 
COOPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT IN DUBLIN IN THE FIGHT 
AGAINST THE IRA, BUT ALSO ARE CONVINCED THAT THE IRISH 
REPUBLIC COULD DO MORE TO HELP.  PERHAPS THE SHOCK OF 
THE CURRENT WAVE OF ATTACKS, SAYS HMG, WILL ACCELERATE 
THE IMPROVEMENT IN SECURITY COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO 
GOVERNMENTS.  LONDON HOPES THAT IMPROVED INTRA-EUROPEAN 
COOPERATION IN COMBATTING TERRORISM WILL HELP TO 
MINIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IRA ATTACKS ON BRITISH 
MILITARY FORCES STATIONED IN EUROPE. 
 
END SUMMARY. 
 
THE IRA PLAYS TO THE NEWS AND CHALLENGES LONDON TO REACT 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
3.  THE RECENT ESCALATION OF TERRORIST ATTACKS BY THE 
IRA, INCLUDING BOMBINGS OF UK MILITARY TARGETS IN 
CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND THE FIRST IRA BOMBING IN BRITAIN 
ITSELF IN FOUR YEARS, HAS REFOCUSED ATTENTIONS IN 
WHITEHALL ON THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING IRA TERRORISM. 
WHAT THE KILLINGS BY THE IRA HAVE NOT DONE IS UNDERMINE 
EITHER THE THATCHER GOVERNMENT\'S RESOLVE TO STICK TO ITS 
POLICIES ON NORTHERN IRELAND OR THE CONSERVATIVE 
POLITICAL CONSENSUS BEHIND THOSE POLICIES. 
 
4.  THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE AND HMG POLICE OFFICIALS 
CALCULATE THAT THE IRA PLANS ITS ATTACKS MAINLY FOR NEWS 
VALUE.  SPOKESMEN FOR THE IRA AND ITS POLITICAL WING, 
SINN FEIN, HAVE CONFIRMED THIS IN RECENT INTERVIEWS WITH 
JOURNALISTS.  THE IRA WANTS ITS ATTACKS TO SHOCK THE 
PUBLIC IN BRITAIN AND WEAR DOWN BRITISH DETERMINATION TO 
STAY IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE UK SUNDAY NEWSPAPER \"THE 
OBSERVER\" REPORTED ON AUGUST 7 THAT IRA SOURCES TOLD ITS 
REPORTERS THE AUGUST 1 BOMBING OF AN ARMY DEPOT IN 
LONDON (REFTEL A) WAS UNDERTAKEN ON THE BORDER OF PRIME 
MINISTER THATCHER\'S OWN PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCY WITH 
THE HOPES THAT IT WOULD KILL MANY SOLDIERS (ONE DIED IN 
THE BLAST) AND FORCE MRS. THATCHER TO RETURN EARLY FROM 
HER AUSTRALIA VISIT. 
 
5.  THE BOMBINGS HAVE EMBARASSED THE GOVERNMENT BUT NOT 
NEARLY SO MUCH AS THE IRA APPARENTLY WOULD LIKE.  SO 
FAR, IT HAS STIFFENED RATHER THAN WEAKENED LONDON\'S 
RESOLVE.  AND, WHILE THE KILLINGS HAVE SCORED INTENSIVE 
NEWS COVERAGE, THEY PROBABLY HAVE NOT INCREASED 
SIGNIFICANTLY THE NUMBERS OF BRITONS WHO AGREE WITH THE 
\"TIME TO GO\" MOVEMENT FOR A BRITISH WITHDRAWAL FROM 
ULSTER.  THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS THAT MANY ORDINARY 
CITIZENS DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY MILITARY INSTALLATIONS 
AND OTHER POTENTIAL TERRORIST TARGETS CANNOT BE 
PROTECTED BETTER.  IN UK TELEVISION INTERVIEWS, SEVERAL 
PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR THE NORTH LONDON ARMY BASE ATTACKED 
ON AUGUST 1 SAID THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN AMAZED THAT 
SECURITY WAS SO LAX AT THE BASE.  BUT MANY OTHER 
BRITONS, EVEN WHILE THEY WINCE AT EACH DAY\'S TALLY OF 
BOMBING VICTIMS, DO NOT EXPECT THEIR GOVERNMENT TO BE 
ABLE TO FEND OFF TERRORISTS EVERY TIME.  THEY APPEAR TO 
UNDERSTAND, AS EX-PRIME MINISTER STANLEY BALDWIN TOLD 
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN 1932, THAT DESPITE ANY 
PRECAUTIONS \"THE BOMBER WILL ALWAYS GET THROUGH.\" 
 
THE ESCALATION WAS EXPECTED 
--------------------------- 
6.  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND TOM KING 
DECLARED IN LATE JULY THAT THE IRA WAS BECOMING 
INCREASINGLY \"INCOMPETENT,\" AS EVIDENCED BY A SERIES OF 
BUNGLED ATTACKS IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN WHICH INNOCENT 
BYSTANDERS WERE KILLED OR INJURED INSTEAD OF MEMBERS OF 
THE SECURITY FORCES.  THE RECENT ESCALATION OF KILLINGS 
CAME SO FAST AFTER KING\'S STATEMENT AS TO SEEM PROMPTED 
BY IT.  THE NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE (NIO) TOLD US THAT 
KING\'S PRONOUNCEMENT WAS OVERLY OPTIMISTIC AND WAS NOT 
REFLECTED IN ANY RELAXATION OF VIGILANCE BY THE POLICE 
AND MILITARY FORCES.  SECURITY OFFICIALS HAVE KNOWN THE 
IRA WAS MERELY PAUSING AND WAS OVERDUE FOR A COME-BACK. 
 
7.  NIO OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT EVER SINCE UK SECURITY 
FORCES REVEALED THEIR PENETRATION OF IRA COMMUNICATIONS 
WHEN THEY KILLED EIGHT IRA TERRORISTS IN MAY 1987 AT 
LOUGHGALL, NORTHERN IRELAND, THE IRA HAS BEEN HOLDING 
BACK WHILE IT CHANGED ITS METHODS.  THE TERRORISTS HAVE 
AMASSED TONS OF ARMAMENTS, CHIEFLY FROM LIBYA, BUT HAVE 
BEEN FEELING THEIR WAY WITH NEW PROCEDURES FOR MAKING 
AND COMMUNICATING DECISIONS.  THE KILLING OF CIVILIAN 
BYSTANDERS AT ENNISKILLEN IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR AND 
IN SEVERAL OTHER APPARENTLY BUNGLED IRA ATTACKS SINCE 
THEN PROBABLY WAS DUE IN PART TO A DECENTRALIZATION OF 
IRA DECISION-MAKING.  TO AVOID LEAKS AND INTERCEPTS, 
LOCAL IRA UNITS WERE TOLD TO OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY.  SAS 
AND POLICE SPECIAL BRANCH UNITS HAVE EXCELLENT 
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES WHICH THE IRA CORRECTLY ASSUMES 
INCLUDE \"MOLES\" IN ITS OWN RANKS.  THE SAFETY WARNING 
FOR THE IRA, AND THE BOAST OF UK AUTHORITIES, IS THAT IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND \"EVERY TREE HAS ITS SPECIAL BRANCH.\" 
 
8.  AFTER MORE THAN HALF A YEAR OF PREPARATIONS, UK 
OFFICIALS TOLD US, THE IRA PLANNED A SERIES OF ATTACKS 
WHICH WAS TO INCLUDE THE GIBRALTAR BOMBING IN JANUARY. 
THE FAILURE OF THAT ATTACK (REFTEL B) AND THE REVELATION 
THAT ONCE AGAIN UK SECURITY OFFICIALS WERE AWARE OF ITS 
PLANS PROBABLY CAUSED THE IRA TO DELAY OR DEFER OTHER 
ATTACKS.  IT WENT AHEAD WITH BOMBINGS DIRECTED AGAINST 
UK MILITARY PERSONNEL IN OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE, 
APPARENTLY SECURE IN THE BELIEF THAT AT LEAST ONE 
\"ACTIVE SERVICE UNIT\" EMPLACED TO OPERATE IN GERMANY AND 
THE NETHERLANDS HAD NOT BEEN DETECTED BY EITHER UK OR 
LOCAL SECURITY OFFICIALS.  WHATEVER ATTACKS HAD BEEN 
PLANNED IN BRITAIN ITSELF PROBABLY WERE JUDGED TO BE 
MORE RISKY AND WERE DELAYED AGAIN, BUT UK AUTHORITIES 
WERE CONVINCED THEY WOULD OCCUR EVENTUALLY. 
 
9.  UK SECURITY OFFICIALS KNEW OF MANY IRA MEMBERS AND 
SYMPATHIZERS IN BRITAIN AND WATCHED THEM AS CLOSELY AS 
POSSIBLE.  BUT WHEN THE ATTACK CAME IN NORTH LONDON ON 
AUGUST 1 IT WAS BY A \"SLEEPER,\" AN INDIVIDUAL OR A UNIT 
OF THE IRA NOT KNOWN BY SPECIAL BRANCH TO BE IN ENGLAND 
AND READY FOR AN ATTACK HERE.  THERE MIGHT BE, OF 
COURSE, OTHER TERRORISTS IN BRITAIN PREPARING FOR 
ADDITIONAL ATTACKS.  MINISTRY OF DEFENSE CONTACTS TOLD 
US THAT A GREAT MANY DEFENSE INSTALLATIONS HERE ARE 
\"SOFT TARGETS\" SUCH AS RECRUITING OFFICES AND URBAN 
DEPOTS WHERE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO INCREASE SECURITY 
PRECAUTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY.  IF A WELL-TRAINED IRA UNIT 
IS POISED AND EQUIPPED FOR ANOTHER ATTACK, SAID THE MOD, 
IT COULD WELL FIND ITS MARK. 
 
INTERNMENT FOR THE IRA IN ULSTER? 
--------------------------------- 
10.  WHILE THERE MAY NOT BE MUCH MORE BY WAY OF 
PRECAUTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN IN BRITAIN, THE SITUATION 
IS DIFFERENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  SOME BACKBENCH 
CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT HAVE REACTED TO THE 
RECENT ATTACKS HERE AND IN ULSTER BY DEMANDING THE 
REINTRODUCTION OF INTERNMENT, THE IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT 
TRIAL OR FORMAL CHARGES IN COURT OF KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE 
IRA AND OTHER VIOLENT GROUPS, BOTH CATHOLIC AND 
PROTESTANT. 
 
11.  INTERNMENT WAS ADOPTED IN AUGUST 1971 WHEN 450 
MEMBERS OF THE IRA WERE ROUNDED UP BY THE ARMY AND 
POLICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN \"OPERATION DEMETRIUS.\" 
100 OF THOSE ARRESTED HAD TO BE RELEASED BECAUSE OF 
INSUFFICIENT INTELLIGENCE TO BE CERTAIN OF THE CHARGES 
AGAINST THEM, SO THAT THE COMMAND STRUCTURE OF THE IRA 
APPARENTLY WAS LEFT INTACT.  OPPONENTS OF INTERNMENT NOW 
CONCEDE THAT CURRENT INTELLIGENCE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAT 
A NEW ROUND-UP PROBABLY WOULD SUCCEED IN GREATLY 
DISRUPTING IRA PLANS.  TOM KING SAID RECENTLY THAT THE 
OPTION OF INTERNMENT REMAINS \"UNDER REVIEW,\" BUT OUR 
CONTACTS IN GOVERNMENT TOLD US THAT IRA ATTACKS WOULD 
HAVE TO BE FAR MORE SERIOUS FOR THE OPTION TO BE 
CHOSEN.  HMG KNOWS THAT ADOPTING INTERNMENT WOULD BE A 
PROPAGANDA VICTORY AND A RECRUITMENT BOON FOR THE IRA. 
ALSO, INTERNMENT VERY LIKELY WOULD NOT WORK UNLESS IT 
WAS ADOPTED SIMULTANEOUSLY BY THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, 
WHICH UK OFFICIALS REGARD AS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY. 
 
THE UK WANTS MORE HELP FROM IRELAND 
----------------------------------- 
12.  UK OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT ONE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THE 
WAR AGAINST IRA TERRORISM IS IMPROVED SECURITY 
COOPERATION WITH THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND.  THEY THINK 
THAT DUBLIN HAS NOT YET FELT COMPELLED TO PUT ITS WEIGHT 
FULLY AGAINST THE TERRORISTS IN PART BECAUSE THE IRA, 
EVEN THOUGH IT DECLARES THE DUBLIN GOVERNMENT IS 
\"ILLEGAL\" AND THAT THE IRISH POLICE AND MILITARY ARE 
LEGITIMATE TARGETS FOR ATTACK, HAS WISELY REFRAINED FROM 
ENDANGERING ITS SANCTUARY ON THE IRISH SIDE OF THE 
BORDER BY ATTACKING THE REPUBLIC\'S OFFICIALS AND ARMED 
FORCES THERE. 
 
13.  THERE WERE EVENTS IN 1987 WHICH EMBARRASSED THE 
DUBLIN GOVERNMENT INTO GREATER ACTION, SAY UK OFFICIALS, 
SUCH AS THE CAPTURE OF THE ARMS SHIP EKSUND AND THE 
REVELATION THEREFROM THAT THE IRA HAD BEEN IMPORTING 
LARGE QUANTITIES OF ARMS FROM LIBYA INTO IRELAND TO BE 
USED AGAINST FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE SUBSEQUENT 
FAILURE OF THE INTENSIVE EFFORT OF IRISH FORCES IN 
\"OPERATION MALLARD\" TO FIND MANY OF THOSE ARMAMENTS, AND 
THE PROLONGED INABILITY OF THE IRISH POLICE IN LATE 1987 
TO CAPTURE THE RENEGADE EX-IRA MEMBER AND RAMPANT 
CRIMINAL DESI O\'HARE, THE POPULARLY STYLED \"BORDER FOX,\" 
EMBARRASSED IRELAND AND ITS SECURITY FORCES STILL MORE. 
NIO OFFICIALS TOLD US THEY BELIEVE IT IS MORE USEFUL NOW 
TO USE EACH ADDITIONAL IRA ATTACK, AND THE PRESUMPTION 
THAT THE IRA TRAVELS RELATIVELY FREELY IN THE REPUBLIC 
AND HAS MUNITIONS STORED THERE, AS ARGUMENTS TO PROD 
DUBLIN INTO MORE COOPERATION. 
 
14.  AT A RECENT EC MEETING IN HANOVER MRS. THATCHER 
ONCE AGAIN CONFRONTED IRISH PRIME MINISTER HAUGHEY OVER 
THE NEED FOR DUBLIN TO BE MORE HELPFUL.  ACCORDING TO 
CABINET SOURCES HERE, HAUGHEY CONCEDED THAT IRELAND\'S 
POLICE AND MILITARY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO 
COOPERATE FULLY WITH BRITISH FORCES IN STOPPING THE 
IRA.  IN RESPONSE TO THATCHER\'S OFFER TO EITHER EXTEND 
BRITISH ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT 
OR TO ARRANGE SUCH ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IF 
NECESSARY, HAUGHEY PROMISED HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD 
REASSESS THE NEED FOR TRAINING AND OTHER SECURITY 
IMPROVEMENTS. 
 
NO END IN SIGHT 
--------------- 
15.  HMG OFFICIALS REGARD THE NORTHERN IRELAND PROBLEM 
AS A PERENNIAL IRRITANT WHICH WILL NOT GO AWAY IN THE 
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  NO ONE WILL FIND A SOLOMONIC WAY TO 
SATISFY THE CONTRADICTORY DEMANDS OF UNIONISTS AND 
REPUBLICANS.  THE PERCEIVED GRIEVANCES OF BOTH SIDES 
WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CONFLICT.  WITH NO NEAR-TERM 
SOLUTION IN SIGHT, THE PRINCIPAL GOALS OF GOVERNMENT ARE 
TO KEEP VIOLENCE DOWN TO TOLERABLE LEVELS IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND, STOP THE SPREAD OF IRA ATTACKS TO BRITAIN AND 
ELSEWHERE, AND RECTIFY THOSE OF THE GRIEVANCES 
UNDERLYING THE CONFLICT WHICH ARE LEGITIMATE. 
 
16.  THE GOVERNMENT IN LONDON BELIEVES THAT CONTINUED 
IRA TERRORISM IS INEVITABLE.  THEY LIKE TO POINT OUT, 
HOWEVER, THAT THE VIOLENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, EVEN 
WITH THE RECENT ESCALATION, IS VERY MUCH LESS THAN IN 
THE PEAK YEAR 1972 AND IN MOST INTERVENING YEARS.  UK 
OFFICIALS ARE CONFIDENT THEY CAN KEEP THE KILLINGS IN 
ULSTER TO NOT MUCH MORE THAN CURRENT LEVELS WITHOUT ANY 
INCREASE IN SECURITY FORCES THERE.  IRA ATTACKS IN 
BRITAIN ITSELF AND IN EUROPE ARE A DIFFERENT MATTER. 
COUNTER-TERRORISM TIES AND COOPERATION AMONG EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS, AND 
THE UK IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT THE IRA CAN BE HELD 
IN CHECK OUTSIDE OF NORTHERN IRELAND EVEN THOUGH ATTACKS 
WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR. 
 
17.  THERE ARE MANY EVENTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND WHICH 
MIGHT BRING IRA ATTACKS, SUCH AS THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE MAZE PRISON ESCAPES ON SEPTEMBER 25 AND SEVERAL 
DIFFERENT DAYS WHEN CATHOLIC OR PROTESTANT ORGANIZATIONS 
WILL BE HAVING PUBLIC MARCHES.  IN ADDITION, THERE ARE 
SEVERAL UPCOMING EVENTS AND ANNIVERSARIES WHICH COULD BE 
CONSIDERED AS POSSIBLE PERIODS OF INCREASED THREAT OF 
IRA TERRORIST ATTACK IN BRITAIN AND EUROPE.  PROMINENT 
AMONG THEM ARE: 
 
-- THE BEGINNING, NOW SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 6, OF THE 
INQUEST BY THE GIBRALTAR CORONER INTO THE KILLING OF 
THREE IRA TERRORISTS THERE LAST JANUARY. 
 
-- THE ANNUAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE, OCTOBER 
11-14.  THE CONFERENCE WILL BE AT BRIGHTON THIS YEAR, 
THE SAME PLACE WHERE AN IRA BOMB CAME CLOSE TO KILLING 
MARGARET THATCHER AND A MAJOR PART OF HER CABINET DURING 
THE PARTY CONFERENCE IN 1984. 
 
-- 1989 WILL MARK THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF BOTH THE 
INTRODUCTION OF BRITISH TROOPS INTO NORTHERN IRELAND AND 
THE CREATION OF THE PROVISIONAL IRA.  1989 COULD BE A 
BAD YEAR FOR COMMEMORATIVE TERRORISM.

REPORT OF PATTERNS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM BEGINS AT 
PARAGRAPH 2.  DEPARTMENT DRAFTERS SHOULD NOTE THAT AT 
THE TIME OF THIS WRITING, HMG IS WARNING THE PUBLIC THAT 
THE IRA APPARENTLY IS PLANNING A MAJOR BOMBING CAMPAIGN 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND POSSIBLY ALSO IN BRITAIN, 
BEFORE THE END OF 1988.  IF SUCH A CAMPAIGN TAKES PLACE, 
OUR SUBMISSION MIGHT REQUIRE A YEAR-END UPDATE.

MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN CY 1988 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
2.  IN 1988 THE UK MAINTAINED ITS LONGSTANDING POLICY OF 
NOT GRANTING CONCESSIONS TO TERRORISTS, DESPITE AN 
INCREASE IN PUBLIC AND MEDIA ATTENTION TO THE FATE OF 
THREE UK CITIZEN HOSTAGES IN LEBANON.  UK OFFICIALS 
CONTINUED TO BE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN INTERNATIONAL AND 
REGIONAL BODIES WORKING AGAINST TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE 
TREVI GROUP, THE SUMMIT SEVEN, AND GROUPS WITHIN THE 
UN.  THERE IS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP OF COOPERATION AND 
CONSULTATION ON COUNTERTERRORISM BETWEEN U.S. AND UK 
AUTHORITIES.  THE UK CONTINUED IN 1988 TO PROVIDE 
TRAINING AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES TO 
IMPROVE THEIR CAPABILITIES TO COMBAT TERRORISM. 
 
3.  IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN INCIDENTS OF 
TERRORISM INVOLVING MEMBERS OF THE UK\'S LARGE 
COMMUNITIES OF IMMIGRANTS, WHICH INCLUDE PALESTINIANS, 
IRANIANS, IRAQIS, TAMILS, AND OTHERS.  UK AUTHORITIES 
DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS THROUGH NORMAL POLICE AND 
JUDICIAL PROCESSES AND THROUGH EXCHANGES WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES INVOLVED TO IDENTIFY AND APPREHEND TERRORISTS 
AND THEIR SUPPORTERS. 
 
4.  IN JANUARY, A MAN OF IRAQI ORIGIN WHO WAS KNOWN AS A 
CRITIC OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT DIED IN LONDON OF 
POISONING.  BEFORE HE DIED, HE TOLD UK AUTHORITIES THAT 
HE HAD BEEN POISONED AT A DINNER BY SEVERAL OTHER 
IRAQIS; THE AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED THAT TWO OF THEM HAD 
BEEN SENT TO BRITAIN BY THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT AND 
DEPARTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT.  THE CASE IS 
STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. 
 
5.  DOMESTIC TERRORISM BY GROUPS INVOLVED IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND\'S SECTARIAN VIOLENCE REMAINED THE MOST COMMON 
FORM OF TERRORIST INCIDENT DIRECTED AGAINST UK INTERESTS 
THROUGHOUT 1988.  MOST INCIDENTS WERE PERPETRATED BY THE 
IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (IRA).  IN NORTHERN IRELAND ITSELF 
32 MILITARY PERSONNEL, 6 POLICE OFFICERS, AND 53 
CIVILIANS DIED IN 1988. 
 
6.  IN 1988 THE IRA ALSO MADE A NUMBER OF ATTACKS 
OUTSIDE NORTHERN IRELAND.  IN FEBRUARY, BRITISH SECURITY 
FORCES THWARTED A PLANNED IRA BOMBING OF A PUBLIC SQUARE 
IN GIBRALTAR, A UK DEPENDENT TERRITORY, AND KILLED THREE 
OF THE TERRORISTS INVOLVED.  SPANISH LEGAL AND POLICE 
AUTHORITIES GAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE TO UK OFFICIALS 
IN THE CASE.  IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT, HAD THE 
BOMBING OCCURRED ACCORDING TO THE IRA\'S PLANS, MORE THAN 
ONE HUNDRED PERSONS COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED AND MANY 
OTHERS INJURED, MOST OF THEM CIVILIAN BYSTANDERS AND 
TOURISTS. 
 
7.  THE IRA MADE OTHER ATTACKS ON BRITISH INTERESTS IN 
MAINLAND EUROPE DURING 1988.  ON MAY 1, THREE OFF-DUTY 
UK SERVICEMEN WERE MACHINE-GUNNED IN A CAR IN THE 
NETHERLANDS; ONE DIED.  ON THE SAME DAY, A CAR BOMB 
KILLED TWO RAF MEN AND SERIOUSLY INJURED ONE OTHER, ALSO 
IN THE NETHERLANDS.  ON MAY 5 ANOTHER BOMB ATTACHED TO A 
UK SERVICEMAN\'S CAR IN GERMANY FAILED TO EXPLODE.  ON 
JULY 13 IRA TERRORISTS CUT THROUGH A UK MILITARY BASE 
PERIMETER FENCE TO PLANT TWO BOMBS WHICH INJURED NINE 
SOLDIERS.  ON AUGUST 5 A BOMB EXPLODED AT A MILITARY 
BASE IN GERMANY, INJURING THREE UK SERVICEMEN AND ONE 
GERMAN CIVILIAN.  LATER IN THE YEAR, GERMAN AUTHORITIES 
ARRESTED TWO MEN WHO ARE SUSPECTED OF BEING IRA MEMBERS 
INVOLVED IN THE SEVERAL INCIDENTS DESCRIBED. 
 
8.  IN BRITAIN ITSELF, THE IRA CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE BOMBING IN AUGUST OF AN UNGUARDED MILITARY 
INSTALLATION IN NORTH LONDON.  TWO SOLDIERS WERE KILLED 
AND EIGHT OTHERS WERE INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION. 
 
9.  ON DECEMBER 6, THE UK PARLIAMENT APPROVED 
LEGISLATION WHICH STRENGTHENS EXISTING LAWS TO COMBAT 
TERRORISM.  THE LEGISLATION -- 
 
-- RENEWED THE 1984 PREVENTION OF TERRORISM (TEMPORARY 
PROVISIONS) ACT AND MADE IT PERMANENT, SO THAT IT NO 
LONGER REQUIRES PERIODIC REVIEW AND RENEWAL BY PARLIAMENT; 
 
-- GAVE THE GOVERNMENT NEW POWERS TO SEIZE FUNDS 
DESTINED FOR TERRORISTS, TO COMBAT RACKETEERING AS A 
MEANS OF RAISING FUNDS BY TERRORIST GROUPS, AND TO 
PREVENT THE \"LAUNDERING\" OF MONEY INTENDED FOR TERRORIST 
GROUPS; 
 
-- REAFFIRMED THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO BAN 
CERTAIN PERSONS BELIEVED TO BE INVOLVED IN TERRORISM IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND FROM ENTERING OTHER AREAS OF THE UK; 
 
-- RENEWED THE PROSCRIPTION IN THE UK OF TWO TERRORIST 
GROUPS, THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (IRA) AND THE IRISH 
NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (INLA); AND 
 
-- IN NORTHERN IRELAND ONLY, REDUCED THE REMISSION OF 
SENTENCES ALLOWED FOR CONVICTED TERRORISTS FROM ONE-HALF 
TO ONE-THIRD OF THEIR SENTENCES. 
 
THE LEGISLATION ALSO RENEWED THE AUTHORITY OF THE 
GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR UP TO 
SEVEN DAYS WITHOUT FORMAL CHARGES OR ARRAIGNMENT BEFORE 
A JUDGE.  IN NOVEMBER, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS DECLARED THAT THIS PRACTICE WAS ILLEGAL.  THE UK 
IS EXAMINING STEPS IT MIGHT TAKE TO BRING UK LAWS AND 
PROCEDURES INTO ACCORD WITH THE COURT\'S FINDINGS. 
 
THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
----------------------------------- 
10.  THE UK JUDICIARY IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN WHOLLY 
SUPPORTIVE OF GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO BRING TERRORISTS TO 
JUSTICE.  THE UK HOME OFFICE AND FOREIGN OFFICE CONTINUE 
TO WORK WITH THE COURTS TO IMPROVE PROCEDURES FOR 
EXTRADITION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. 
 
11.  IN FEBRUARY, POLICE ARRESTED A SIKH LIVING IN 
ENGLAND WHO WAS WANTED ON SUSPICION OF INVOLVEMENT IN A 
1985 LUGGAGE EXPLOSION AT NARITA AIRPORT IN JAPAN IN 
WHICH TWO BAGGAGE HANDLERS WERE KILLED.  THE LUGGAGE 
ARRIVED ON A FLIGHT FROM TORONTO AND EXPLODED AT THE 
SAME TIME THAT AN EXPLOSION DESTROYED AN AIR INDIA JUMBO 
JET, ALSO FLYING FROM TORONTO, OVER THE OCEAN NEAR 
IRELAND, KILLING ALL 329 PEOPLE ON BOARD.  A UK COURT 
ORDERED THE MAN EXTRADITED TO CANADA, BUT HE HAS 
APPEALED.  HIS CASE IS PENDING.

SUBJECT:  1989 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT FOR THE UK 
 
REF:  STATE 363024 
 
MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1989 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
1.  THROUGHOUT 1989, AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS, THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST THREAT TO THE UK AND UK INTERESTS 
WERE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OUTLAWED PROVISIONAL IRISH 
REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE 
ACTIVITIES OF OUTLAWED PROTESTANT TERRORIST GROUPS IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE CONFLICT IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
CAUSED THE DEATHS OF 62 PEOPLE  IN 1989, INCLUDING 14 
MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY FORCES AND 9 POLICEMEN KILLED IN 
TERRORIST ATTACKS.  PIRA TERRORIST ATTACKS ON TARGETS IN 
BRITAIN AND IN MAINLAND EUROPE RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 
AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN UK ARMED FORCES PERSONNEL OR THEIR 
FAMILY MEMBERS IN 1989. 
 
2.  HMG CONTINUED IN 1989 TO DEMAND INFORMATION FROM 
LIBYA ABOUT ITS SUPPORT FOR THE PIRA, INCLUDING 
DELIVERIES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS OF EXPLOSIVES, 
ARMAMENTS, AND AMMUNITION IN LARGE QUANTITIES.  DESPITE 
CONTINUING OCCASIONAL CAPTURES OF PIRA ARMS AND SUPPLIES 
IN 1989, THE PIRA WAS BELIEVED STILL TO HAVE ENOUGH 
LIBYAN-SUPPLIED ARMS TO SUSTAIN ITS DESTRUCTIVE 
TERRORIST CAMPAIGN FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. 
 
3.  THE FATWA -- OR DEATH EDICT -- OF IRAN\'S AYATOLLAH 
KHOMEINI AGAINST THE BRITISH AUTHOR SALMAN RUSHDIE ON 14 
FEBRUARY 1989 LED TO WIDESPREAD PUBLIC DISTURBANCES 
AMONG ISLAMIC COMMUNITIES IN BRITAIN AND ABROAD.  THERE 
WERE SEVERAL INSTANCES OF BOMBINGS OF BOOKSTORES SELLING 
RUSHDIE\'S BOOK \"SATANIC VERSES.\"  THREATS AGAINST 
PUBLISHERS AND MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES REQUIRED POLICE 
PROTECTION.  UK AUTHORITIES ARRESTED AND DEPORTED 23 
IRANIANS ON NATIONAL SECURITY GROUNDS IN 1989. 
 
4.  BRITISH POLICE PROVIDED ROUND-THE-CLOCK PROTECTION 
FOR SALMAN RUSHDIE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF 1989 TO 
PREVENT HIS MURDER BY MUSLIM FANATICS WHO MIGHT SEEK TO 
CARRY OUT THE \"SENTENCE OF DEATH\" AGAINST THE AUTHOR. 
HMG OFFICIALS REPEATEDLY MADE CLEAR IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
TO IRANIAN AUTHORITIES THAT THE UK HELD IRAN DIRECTLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTION TAKEN AGAINST BRITISH OR 
OTHER NATIONALS AS A RESULT OF THE FATWA. 
 
5.  UK AUTHORITIES CONTINUED IN 1989 TO INVESTIGATE THE 
BOMBING OF PAN AMERICAN FLIGHT 103 OVER LOCKERBIE, 
SCOTLAND IN DECEMBER 1988.  THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN 
EXTREMELY FAR-REACHING AND COSTLY BUT HAS RESULTED IN 
CONSIDERABLE NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE NATURE OF 
TERRORIST ATTACKS ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND IN 
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN AVIATION SECURITY SYSTEMS 
AND PROCEDURES.  UK INVESTIGATORS HAVE WORKED CLOSELY ON 
THE CASE WITH CRIMINAL SPECIALISTS AND FORENSIC 
SCIENTISTS OF THE UNITED STATES, THE FRG, AND OTHER 
CONCERNED COUNTRIES.  BRITAIN SHARES A POSITION OF 
LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD-WIDE EFFORT TO CONCLUDE NEW 
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ON AVIATION SECURITY, CONTROL 
OF EXPLOSIVES, AND THE SHARING OF INFORMATION AND 
TECHNOLOGY TO COMBAT TERRORIST THREATS TO CIVIL AVIATION. 
 
6.  THE UK PROVIDES TRAINING, ADVICE, AND MATERIAL 
ASSISTANCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES TO ASSIST THEIR OWN 
EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORIST THREATS. 
 
7.  THE UK IS ACTIVE IN THE UN, THE EC, AND OTHER 
INTERNATIONAL FORA IN EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM AND 
PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN EFFORTS 
TO ISOLATE AND PENALIZE COUNTRIES WHICH SUPPORT TERRORISM. 
 
RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
------------------------------- 
8.  UK COURTS IN BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND CONTINUED 
IN 1989 TO PROSECUTE CASES AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE PIRA 
AND OTHER TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN THE 
DISTURBANCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
 
9.  BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT THREAT OF PIRA TERRORIST 
ATTACKS IN THE UK, BRITAIN CONTINUED IN 1989 TO EXERCISE 
THE SPECIAL PROVISIONS OF LAW CONTAINED IN THE 1984 
PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT.  THE ACT, AMONG ITS OTHER 
ELEMENTS, ENABLES SPECIAL COURTS TO OPERATE IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND DESPITE THE PERSISTENT THREAT OF PIRA TERRORISM 
AGAINST JUDGES AND JURIES. 
 
10.  THERE ARE OUTSTANDING UK ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST 
PIRA TERRORISTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND SEVERAL 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  UK AUTHORITIES CONTINUED IN 1989 TO 
COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH OFFICIALS IN IRELAND, BELGIUM, 
THE NETHERLANDS, THE FRG, FRANCE, AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
DEALING WITH INCIDENTS OF PIRA TERRORISM AND ATTEMPTING 
TO ARRANGE EXTRADITION OF PIRA MEMBERS WANTED FOR 
TERRORIST ATTACKS.

TAGS:        PTER, UK 
SUBJECT:     UNITED KINGDOM: 1991 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 346420 
 
1.  FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY INPUT FOR THE UK PORTION OF THE 
1991 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS 
POSED IN PARA 5 REFTEL ARE CONTAINED IN PARAS 3-10 BELOW. 
 
2.  EMBASSY SUGGESTS THAT THE FINAL REPORT INCORPORATE 
IN SOME FASHION THE FOLLOWING POINTS ON THE THREAT POSED 
BY TERRORISM TO THE UNITED KINGDOM: 
 
--   FOR TWO DECADES THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS FACED ONE OF 
     THE MOST DETERMINED, SOPHISTICATED AND LETHAL 
     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WORLD IN THE FORM OF 
     THE PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) AND 
     ITS OFFSHOOTS, MOST NOTABLY THE IRISH NATIONAL 
     LIBERATION ARMY (INLA) AND THE IRISH PEOPLE\'S 
     LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (IPLO). 
 
--   THE ANNOUNCED AIM OF THE PIRA IS TO BRING ABOUT THE 
     INCORPORATION OF NORTHERN IRELAND (AND THE REPUBLIC 
     OF IRELAND) INTO A NEW, RADICALLY SOCIALIST, UNITED 
     IRISH STATE.  ITS METHODS INCLUDE KILLING OF POLICE 
     AND BRITISH ARMY FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND, GREAT 
     BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT, AND BOMBING OF 
     SHOPS, FACTORIES AND TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES 
     THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM. 
 
--   LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO PIRA ATTACKS, \"LOYALIST\" 
     TERRORIST GROUPS SUCH AS THE ULSTER VOLUNTEER FORCE 
     (UVF) AND ULSTER FREEDOM FIGHTERS (UFF) OVER THE 
     YEARS HAVE MURDERED HUNDREDS OF CATHOLICS SUSPECTED 
     OF \"REPUBLICAN\" SYMPATHIES. 
 
--   THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FATALTIES RESULTING FROM THE 
     NORTHERN IRELAND \"TROUBLES\" SINCE 1969 NOW EXCEEDS 
     3,000.  WHILE BOTH \"REPUBLICAN\" AND \"LOYALIST\" 
     PARAMILITARIES INSIST THEY TARGET ONLY SECURITY 
     FORCES AND TERRORISTS ON THE OTHER SIDE, MOST OF 
     THEIR VICTIMS HAVE IN FACT BEEN CIVILIANS. 
 
--   DIRECT ECONOMIC DAMAGES RESULTING FROM BOMBING AND 
     ARSON, WHILE WELL BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE EARLY 
     1970\'S, STILL RUN INTO THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF 
     DOLLARS A YEAR, AND THE ECONOMIC COST OF LOST 
     INVESTMENT AND PRODUCTION IS MUCH HIGHER. 
 
--   PIRA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE ACQUIRED LARGE STOCKS OF 
     ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES FROM LIBYA. 
 
--   INCIDENTS AND THREATS OF TERRORISM OTHER THAN THOSE 
     FLOWING FROM THE NORTHERN IRELAND SITUATION ARE 
     RELATIVELY FEW, BUT NOT INSIGNIFICANT.  BRITISH 
     AUTHOR SALMAN RUSHDIE REMAINS UNDER THREAT FROM AN 
     ASSASSINATION ORDER BY THE LATE AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI, 
     AND REQUIRES CONSTANT POLICE PROTECTION.  IN 
     ADDITION, BRITISH PARTICIPATION IN THE LIBERATION 
     OF KUWAIT, AND THE ISSUANCE OF ARREST WARRANTS 
     AGAINST LIBYAN OFFICIALS IN THE 1988 BOMBING OF PAN 
     AM 103, HAVE INCREASED THE UK\'S SUSCEPTIBILITY TO 
     ATTACK BY RADICAL ARAB GROUPS. 
 
3.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: 
 
--   SIKH MILITANT PARAMJIT SINGH SIDHU AND TWO 
     ACCOMPLICES WERE CONVICTED IN JULY 1991 OF 
     CONSPIRING TO CAUSE EXPLOSIONS IN THE UK. 
 
--   PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN NORTHERN 
     IRELAND CONTINUES AT A HIGH LEVEL: 131 WERE TRIED, 
     AND 122 CONVICTED, OF TERRORISM-RELATED OFFENSES IN 
     THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 1991. 
 
4.  EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION: 
 
--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REQUESTED EXTRADITION OF 
     CONVICTED PIRA BOMBER ANGELO FUSCO FROM THE 
     REPUBLIC OF IRELAND IN DECEMBER 1991; FUSCO IS 
     CURRENTLY ON BAIL PENDING AN EXTRADITION HEARING. 
 
--   PIRA BOMB-MAKER DESSIE ELLIS, WHO HAD SERVED EIGHT 
     YEARS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND FOR MAKING BOMBS 
     FOR USE IN NORTHERN IRELAND, WAS EXTRADITED TO 
     LONDON IN NOVEMBER 1990 ON SIMILAR CHARGES 
     CONCERNING THE 1980-81 BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN GREAT 
     BRITAIN.  IN OCTOBER 1991 ELLIS WAS ACQUITTED, 
     APPARENTLY HAVING CONVINCED A JURY THAT HE HAD 
     NEITHER KNOWN NOR INTENDED THAT HIS BOMBS WOULD BE 
     USED ON THE BRITISH MAINLAND. 
 
5.  SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: 
 
--   AS A RESULT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT FORENSIC EVIDENCE 
     AND POLICE EXTRACTION OF CONFESSIONS, A NUMBER OF 
     PERSONS FORMERLY CONVICTED OF TERRORIST OFFENSES ON 
     THE BRITISH MAINLAND WERE RELEASED ON APPEAL DURING 
     1991. 
 
--   EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FROM THE 
     REPUBLIC OF IRELAND REMAINS A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE, 
     DESPITE IMPROVEMENTS IN PROCEDURES AND MUTUAL 
     CONFIDENCE RESULTING FROM THE 1985 ANGLO-IRISH 
     AGREEMENT AND DUBLIN\'S 1987 RATIFICATION OF THE 
     EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF 
     TERRORISM.  MANY IN IRELAND CONTINUE TO REGARD PIRA 
     ATTACKS IN THE UK AS \"POLITICAL OFFENSES,\" AND 
     VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE THE EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTS IN 
     THESE CASES.  THEY ALSO CONTINUE TO QUESTION 
     WHETHER IRISH SUSPECTS CAN RECEIVE FAIR TRIALS IN 
     BRITAIN. 
 
--   ON NOVEMBER 15, 1991 THE IRISH SUPREME COURT DENIED 
     EXTRADITION OF TWO CONVICTED PIRA TERRORISTS WHO 
     WERE WANTED ON WEAPONS POSSESSION CHARGES IN THE 
     UK.  THE COURT RULED THAT UNDER EXISTING IRISH LAW 
     POSSESSION -- AS OPPOSED TO USE -- OF WEAPONS WAS A 
     POLITICAL OFFENSE.  THE IRISH GOVERNMENT 
     SUBSEQUENTLY PROMISED TO AMEND ITS LAWS TO CLOSE 
     THIS LOOPHOLE. 
 
6.  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: 
 
--   UK POLICY REMAINS STEADFAST IN REFUSING TO 
     COUNTENANCE ANY CONCESSION TO TERRORISM, AND IS 
     WHOLLY CONSISTENT WITH U.S. POLICY. 
 
--   UK OFFICIALS COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH THEIR U.S. 
     COUNTERPARTS IN INVESTIGATING THE 1988 BOMBING OF 
     PAN AM 103 OVER LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND.  WARRANTS HAVE 
     BEEN ISSUED FOR THE ARREST OF TWO LIBYAN OFFICIALS 
     BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBING, AND THE 
     UK HAS JOINED THE U.S. IN DEMANDING CESSATION OF 
     LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. 
 
--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT\'S MAIN LEGAL TOOLS IN THE 
     FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM ARE THE PREVENTION OF 
     TERRORISM (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT OF 1989 (PTA 
     AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND (EMERGENCY PROVISIONS) ACT 
     OF 1991 (EPA).  BOTH ACTS RE-ENACTED AND AMENDED 
     PROVISIONS OF EARLIER LAWS. 
 
--   UNDER THE PTA, THE HOME SECRETARY (OR THE SECRETARY 
     OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND OR NORTHERN IRELAND, AS 
     APPROPRIATE) MAY EXCLUDE PERSONS SUSPECTED OF 
     INVOLVEMENT WITH TERRORISM FROM ANY PART OR ALL OF 
     THE UNITED KINGDOM.  POLICE MAY DETAIN SUSPECTED 
     TERRORISTS WITHOUT CHARGE FOR 48 HOURS, AND FOR A 
     FURTHER FIVE DAYS WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE 
     APPROPRIATE CABINET SECRETARY.  IN THE FIRST THREE 
     QUARTERS OF 1991, 1,232 PERSONS WERE DETAINED UNDER 
     THE PTA, AND 440 EXTENSIONS BEYOND 48 HOURS WERE 
     GRANTED. 
 
--   THE 1991 EPA CONSOLIDATED ALL THE COUNTERTERRORISM 
     PROVISIONS OF PREVIOUS LAWS THAT APPLIED 
     EXCLUSIVELY TO NORTHERN IRELAND.  IT INTRODUCED NEW 
     OFFENSES OF DIRECTING A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AND 
     POSSESSION OF ITEMS INTENDED FOR TERRORIST 
     PURPOSES, AND GAVE AUTHORITIES NEW POWERS TO 
     EXAMINE DOCUMENTS FOUND IN TERRORISM-RELATED 
     SEARCHES, TO SEIZE EQUIPMENT USED TO REOPEN CLOSED 
     BORDER CROSSINGS, TO INVESTIGATE THE FINANCING OF 
     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, AND TO CONFISCATE THE 
     PROCEEDS OF TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITIES. 
 
7.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1991 BY 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT: 
 
--   IN ORDER TO ERADICATE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
     CATHOLICS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, WHICH FUELS SUPPORT 
     FOR THE PIRA, THE GOVERNMENT HAS VIGOROUSLY 
     ENFORCED THE 1989 FAIR EMPLOYMENT (NORTHERN 
     IRELAND) ACT.  IT HAS ALSO INVESTED LARGE SUMS IN 
     INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
     PROJECTS IN THE PROVINCE. 
 
--   THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECLARED PIRA, INLA, IPLO, UVF 
     AND UFF TO BE \"PROSCRIBED ORGANIZATIONS.\" 
     MEMBERSHIP IN THEM IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE, AND 
     DIRECT BROADCASTS BY THEIR SPOKESMEN ARE NOT 
     ALLOWED ON ELECTRONIC MEDIA. 
 
--   IN RESPONSE TO AN INCREASE IN TERRORIST ATTACKS BY 
     LOYALIST GROUPS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, THE ROYAL 
     ULSTER CONSTABULARY IN OCTOBER ESTABLISHED A 
     SPECIAL POLICE UNIT TO COORDINATE INVESTIGATION OF 
     THESE ATTACKS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO AUGMENTED 
     THE RUC AND BRITISH ARMY FORCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
     TO COUNTER THE RECENT UPSURGE IN TERRORISM THERE. 
 
--   THE UNITED KINGDOM PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN SEVERAL 
     INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM FORA, COORDINATING 
     ITS POSITIONS AND ACTIVITIES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. 
     AND OTHERS.  IT ALSO PROVIDES COUNTERTERRORISM 
     ASSISTANCE AND EXPERTISE TO NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTS ON 
     A BILATERAL BASIS. 
 
8.  SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: 
 
--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT PROVIDES NO SUPPORT FOR ANY 
     INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND 
     COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. IN APPLYING 
     PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENTS THAT SUPPORT OR CONDONE 
     TERRORISM. 
 
9.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRIES: 
 
--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO SUCH STATEMENTS. 
 
10.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1990 IN HOST GOVERNMENT 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: 
 
--   THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCH CHANGE.  THE GOVERNMENT 
     REMAINS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM IN ALL FORMS.

SUBJECT:  UNITED KINGDOM:  1992 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 338430 
 
1.   FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY INPUT FOR THE UK PORTION OF 
THE 1992 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  RESPONSES ARE KEYED 
TO QUESTIONS POSED IN PARA 5 REFTEL. 
 
2.   PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: 
 
--   HMG, LIKE THE USG, ISSUED INDICTMENTS OF TWO 
     LIBYANS FOR ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE 1988 BOMBING 
     OF PAN AM 103 ON NOVEMBER 27, 1991.  HMG HAS 
     COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH THE USG AND FRANCE IN 
     DEMANDING THE SURRENDER OF THE SUSPECTS FOR TRIAL 
     IN SCOTLAND OR THE U.S., AND IN OBTAINING UN 
     SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 731 AND 748 ENDORSING 
     THAT DEMAND. 
 
--   PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN NORTHERN 
     IRELAND CONTINUES AT A HIGH LEVEL.  IN THE FIRST 
     NINE MONTHS OF 1992, MORE THAN 270 PERSONS WERE 
     CONVICTED IN THE UK ON CHARGES RELATED TO NORTHERN 
     IRISH TERRORISM, MOSTLY IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  FINAL 
     1992 STATISTICS WILL BE PROVIDED IN JANUARY. 
 
--   POLICE ON THE BRITISH MAINLAND HAVE CONFISCATED AT 
     LEAST 17 TONS OF EXPLOSIVES IN 1992, ALL APPARENTLY 
     INTENDED FOR PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY 
     (PIRA) ATTACKS.  SEVERAL COURT CASES ARE PENDING. 
 
 
 
3.   EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION: 
 
--   GERARD HANRATTY WAS EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED 
     KINGDOM FROM GERMANY TO STAND TRIAL FOR TERRORIST 
     OFFENSES. 
 
--   CONVICTED PIRA MURDERER JOSEPH DOHERTY WAS DEPORTED 
     FROM NEW YORK IN FEBRUARY, AFTER A NINE-YEAR LEGAL 
     STRUGGLE TO REMAIN IN THE U.S., TO RESUME A LIFE 
     SENTENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
 
--   HMG IN JULY REQUESTED THE EXTRADITION OF JAMES 
     JOSEPH SMYTH AND KEVIN ARTT FROM CALIFORNIA.  THE 
     TWO MEN HAD ESCAPED FROM PRISON IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
     IN 1983, WHERE THEY WERE SERVING SENTENCES FOR 
     ATTEMPTED MURDER AND MURDER, RESPECTIVELY. 
 
4.   SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: 
 
--   INTIMIDATION OF JUDGES, JURORS AND WITNESSES HAS 
     BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  AS 
     A RESULT, MOST TRIALS OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS THERE 
     ARE CONDUCTED WITHOUT JURIES (\"DIPLOCK COURTS\"), 
     AND THE IDENTITY OF WITNESSES CAN BE WITHHELD FROM 
     THE DEFENSE. 
 
--   AS A RESULT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT FORENSIC EVIDENCE 
     AND POLICE EXTRACTION OF CONFESSIONS, 18 PERSONS 
     PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF TERRORIST OFFENSES IN 
     BRITAIN HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY APPEALS COURTS SINCE 
     1989. 
 
--   SUBSEQUENTLY, PROSECUTORS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO 
     BRING CASES TO COURT UNLESS THE EVIDENCE WAS 
     OVERWHELMING, AND JURIES HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO 
     CONVICT.  KEVIN O\'DONNELL, ACQUITTED ON TERRORIST 
     CHARGES IN LONDON IN LATE 1991, WAS KILLED IN 
     NORTHERN IRELAND IN FEBRUARY 1992 WHILE 
     PARTICIPATING IN A PIRA ATTACK ON A POLICE STATION. 
 
--   EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FROM THE 
     REPUBLIC OF IRELAND REMAINS A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE, 
     DESPITE IMPROVEMENTS IN PROCEDURES AND MUTUAL 
     CONFIDENCE RESULTING FROM THE 1985 ANGLO-IRISH 
     AGREEMENT AND DUBLIN\'S 1987 RATIFICATION OF THE 
     EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORISM. 
 
5.   HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: 
 
--   UK POLICY REMAINS STEADFAST IN REFUSING TO 
     COUNTENANCE ANY CONCESSION TO TERRORISM, AND IS 
     WHOLLY CONSISTENT WITH U.S. POLICY. 
 
--   AS NOTED ABOVE, HMG WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING 
     OBTAIN UN SECURITY COUNCIL CONDEMNATION OF APPARENT 
     LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOMBINGS OF PAN AM 103 IN 
     1988 AND UTA 772 IN 1989. 
 
--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT\'S MAIN LEGAL TOOLS IN THE 
     FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM ARE THE PREVENTION OF 
     TERRORISM (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT OF 1989 (PTA) 
     AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND (EMERGENCY PROVISIONS) ACT 
     OF 1991 (EPA).  BOTH RE-ENACTED AND AMENDED 
     PROVISIONS OF EARLIER LAWS. 
 
--   UNDER THE PTA, CABINET MINISTERS MAY EXCLUDE 
     PERSONS SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT WITH TERRORISM 
     FROM ALL OR ANY PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 
 
--   POLICE MAY DETAIN SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WITHOUT 
     CHARGE FOR 48 HOURS, AND FOR A FURTHER FIVE DAYS 
     WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE APPROPRIATE CABINET 
     MINISTER.  IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 1992, 1512 
     PERSONS WERE DETAINED UNDER THE PTA; IN 337 OF 
     THESE CASES, THE DETENTIONS WERE EXTENDED BEYOND 
     THE INITIAL 48 HOURS.  FULL-YEAR STATISTICS WILL BE 
     PROVIDED IN JANUARY. 
 
--   BRITISH SECURITY FORCES PARTICIPATED IN 
     INVESTIGATION LEADING TO THE CONVICTION OF ONE 
     PIRA MEMBER IN GERMANY IN JUNE, THE TRIAL OF THREE 
     OTHERS IN GERMANY IN OCTOBER, AND THE INDICTMENT OF 
     FOUR PERSONS IN NEW YORK IN NOVEMBER ON CHARGES OF 
     CONSPIRACY TO SMUGGLE ARMS TO PIRA. 
 
6.   MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS: 
 
--   USING NEW POWERS CONTAINED IN THE 1991 EPA, POLICE 
     IN NORTHERN IRELAND RAIDED SOME 30 SUSPECTED PIRA 
     RACKETEERING AND MONEY-LAUNDERING VENTURES IN MAY. 
     PROTECTION RACKETS, TAX FRAUD, AND RAKED-OFF 
     PROFITS FROM TAXIS AND DRINKING CLUBS REPORTEDLY 
     NOW CONSTITUTE THE MAIN SOURCES OF PIRA INCOME. 
 
--   IN AUGUST, THE GOVERNMENT ADDED THE LOYALIST 
     (PROTESTANT) ULSTER DEFENSE ASSOCIATION (UDA) TO 
     ITS LIST OF PROSCRIBED ORGANIZATIONS, JOINING PIRA, 
     THE IRISH NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (INLA), THE 
     IRISH PEOPLE\'S LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (IPLO), THE 
     ULSTER VOLUNTEER FORCE (UVF), THE ULSTER FREEDOM 
     FIGHTERS (UFF) AND THE RED HAND COMMANDO. 
     MEMBERSHIP IN ANY OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS IS A 
     CRIMINAL OFFENSE, AND DIRECT BROADCASTS BY THEIR 
     SPOKESMEN ARE NOT ALLOWED ON ELECTRONIC MEDIA. 
 
--   IN MAY, THE HOME SECRETARY ANNOUNCED THE TRANSFER 
     OF LEAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR GATHERING INTELLIGENCE 
     ON IRISH REPUBLICAN TERRORISM IN GREAT BRITAIN FROM 
     THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SPECIAL BRANCH TO THE 
     SECURITY SERVICE (MI5), WHICH WAS ALREADY 
     RESPONSIBLE FOR INTELLIGENCE ON INTERNATIONAL AND 
     NORTHERN IRELAND LOYALIST TERRORISM ON THE BRITISH 
     MAINLAND. 
 
--   THE UNITED KINGDOM PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN 
     INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM FORA, COORDINATING 
     ITS ACTIVITIES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. AND OTHERS. 
     IT ALSO PROVIDES COUNTERTERRORISM ASSSISTANCE AND 
     EXPERTISE TO NUMEROUS GOVERNMENTS ON A BILATERAL 
     BASIS. 
 
7.   SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: 
 
--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT PROVIDES NO SUPPORT FOR ANY 
     INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND 
     COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. IN APPLYING 
     PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENTS THAT SUPPORT OR CONDONE 
     TERRORISM. 
 
8.   STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
     COUNTRIES: 
 
--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO SUCH STATEMENTS. 
 
9.   SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1991 IN HOST GOVERNMENT 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: 
 
--   THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCH CHANGE.  HMG REMAINS 
     ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM IN ALL FORMS. 
 
10.  HOST GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTIONS ON LIBYA: 
 
--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, A DRAFTER OF THE UNSC 
     RESOLUTIONS, HAS COMPLIED FULLY WITH THEIR 
     PROVISIONS.

AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: 
 
--   HMG CONTINUES ACTIVELY TO PROSECUTE MEMBERS OF 
     IRISH REPUBLICAN AND ULSTER LOYALIST TERRORIST 
     GROUPS FOR ATTACKS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND GREAT 
     BRITAIN.  SINCE OCTOBER 1992, MORE THAN 20 PERSONS 
     HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR ATTACKS AND OTHER TERRORIST 
     ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAIN, AND SEVERAL HUNDRED IN 
     NORTHERN IRELAND.

4.   SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: 
 
--   INTIMIDATION OF JUDGES, JURORS AND WITNESSES HAS 
     BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  AS 
     A RESULT, MOST TRIALS OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS THERE 
     ARE CONDUCTED WITHOUT JURIES (IN \"DIPLOCK COURTS\"), 
     AND THE IDENTITY OF WITNESSES CAN BE WITHHELD FROM 
     THE DEFENSE. 
 
--   QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF CONFESSION AND 
     FORENSIC EVIDENCE IN TRIALS OF PIRA SUSPECTS IN 
     ENGLAND IN THE 1970\'S CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE 
     PROSECUTORS NOT TO BRING CASES TO TRIAL UNLESS THE 
     EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING, AND MAKE JURORS RELUCTANT 
     TO CONVICT.  CURRENT COURT GUIDELINES ENABLE A 
     JUDGE, AT HIS DISCRETION, TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE TO 
     THE DEFENSE OF ALL EVIDENCE AGAINST THE ACCUSED, 
     WHETHER OR NOT IT IS INTENDED FOR PROSECUTION USE. 
     POLICE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO PROSECUTE CASES IN

     BE COMPROMISED. 
 
5.   RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: 
 
--   HMG COOPERATED CLOSELY WITH THE USG IN TRYING TO 
     PERSUADE LIBYA TO SURRENDER FOR TRIAL THE TWO 
     SUSPECTS IN THE 1988 BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 AND THE 
     1989 BOMBING OF UTA 772.  IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN 
     OBTAINING UNSC APPROVAL OF STRONGER SANCTIONS 
     AGAINST LIBYA. 
 
--   HMG DEPLORED THE ATTACK ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER 
     IN NEW YORK.

     NOVEMBER 24 INTERCEPTION IN NORTHEAST ENGLAND OF A 
     HUGE CLANDESTINE ARMS SHIPMENT DESTINED FOR THE 
     LOYALIST ULSTER VOLUNTEER FORCE (UVF). 
 
6.   MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS: 
 
--   ON DECEMBER 15, THE BRITISH AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS 
     ISSUED A JOINT STATEMENT ON NORTHERN IRELAND, 
     CALLING ON PIRA TO END ITS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE AND 
     OFFERING IT FULL PARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL 
     DISCUSSIONS ON THE FUTURE OF THE PROVINCE AFTER IT 
     DEMONSTRATED RENUNCIATION OF TERRORISM. 
 
--   POLICE AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
     CONTINUED TO CRACK DOWN ON LOYALIST AND REPUBLICAN 
     PROTECTION, FRAUD, SMUGGLING, MONEY-LAUNDERING AND 
     VIDEO PIRATING RACKETS.  THESE ACTIVITIES 
     REPORTEDLY NOW CONSTITUTE THE MAIN SOURCES OF 
     INCOME FOR TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
--   THE UK PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN INTERNATIONAL 
     COUNTERTERRORISM FORA, COORDINATING ITS ACTIVITIES

THE 1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.  RESPONSES ARE KEYED 
TO QUESTIONS POSED IN PARA 3 REFTEL. 
 
2.   PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: 
 
--   HMG CONTINUES ACTIVELY TO PROSECUTE MEMBERS OF THE 
     PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) AND ULSTER 
     LOYALIST TERRORIST GROUPS FOR ATTACKS IN NORTHERN 
     IRELAND AND GREAT BRITAIN BEFORE THEIR CEASEFIRES 
     ON SEPTEMBER 1 AND OCTOBER 14 RESPECTIVELY.  WE 
     HAVE NOTED AT LEAST 17 PROSECUTIONS IN ENGLAND IN 
     1994, AS WELL AS AT LEAST 100 IN NORTHERN IRELAND. 
 
--   THREE PROBABLE PKK TERRORISTS WERE CONVICTED IN 
     AUGUST FOR FIREBOMBS IN LONDON IN NOVEMBER 1993. 
 
--   DESPITE INTENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS, THERE HAVE BEEN 
     NO ARRESTS AS YET FOR THE MARCH SERIES OF PIRA 
     MORTAR BOMBS AT HEATHROW, OR THE BOMBINGS OF THE 
     ISRAELI EMBASSY AND A JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER IN 
     LONDON IN JULY. 
 
3.   EXTRADITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION: 
 
--   HMG HAS BEEN EXTREMELY COOPERATIVE IN EXTRADITING 
     SUSPECTED TERRORISTS (MOST ASSOCIATED WITH PIRA) TO 
     THE U.S. FOR TRIAL.  FURTHER INFORMATION IS 
     AVAILABLE FROM FBI HQ IN WASHINGTON. 
 
--   HMG ALSO EXTRADITED TWO ENGLISH WOMEN TO FACE TRIAL 
     IN OREGON FOR CONSPIRACY TO MURDER A STATE ATTORNEY 
     IN 1986 IN CONNECTION WITH THE BHAGWAN SRI RAJNEESH 
     COMMUNE, DESPITE INTENSE OPPOSITION FROM BRITISH 
     HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS. 
 
--   HMG CONTINUES TO SEEK EXTRADITION FROM THE U.S. OF 
     FOUR PIRA MEMBERS WHO ESCAPED FROM THE MAZE PRISON 
     IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN 1983.  A COURT IN CALIFORNIA 
     REFUSED EXTRADITION OF THE FIRST OF THESE, JAMES 
     SMYTH, BUT AN APPEAL IS UNDER CONSIDERATION. 
 
--   IN FEBRUARY, THE IRISH HIGH COURT REFUSED TO 
     EXTRADITE JOSEPH MAGEE, WANTED FOR THE 1992 MURDER 
     OF A BRITISH ARMY RECRUITING SERGEANT. 
 
--   PKK LEADER KANI YILMAZ, ARRESTED IN LONDON IN 
     OCTOBER, IS RESISTING EXTRADITION TO GERMANY ON 
     ARSON CHARGES. 
 
4.   SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: 
 
--   INTIMIDATION OF JUDGES, JURORS AND WITNESSES HAS 
     BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  AS 
     A RESULT, TRIALS OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS THERE ARE 
     CONDUCTED WITHOUT JURIES (IN \"DIPLOCK COURTS\"), AND 
     THE IDENTITY OF WITNESSES MAY BE WITHHELD FROM THE 
     DEFENSE. 
 
--   QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF CONFESSION AND 
     FORENSIC EVIDENCE IN TRIALS OF IRA SUSPECTS IN 
     ENGLAND IN THE 1970\'S CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE 
     PROSECUTORS NOT TO BRING CASES TO TRIAL UNLESS THE 
     EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING, AND MAKE JURORS RELUCTANT 
     TO CONVICT.  CURRENT COURT GUIDELINES ENABLE A 
     JUDGE, AT HIS DISCRETION, TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE TO 
     THE DEFENSE OF ALL EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE 
     CASE, WHETHER OR NOT INTENDED FOR PROSECUTION USE. 
     POLICE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO PROSECUTE CASES IN 
     WHICH INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS MIGHT THUS BE 
     COMPROMISED. 
 
--   IN RECENT YEARS, PIRA HAS TRAINED ITS MEMBERS TO 
     REFUSE TO ANSWER ANY POLICE QUESTIONS, THEN SPRING 
     A SURPRISE ALIBI AT TRIAL; THIS HAS RESULTED IN 
     ACQUITTALS BEFORE POLICE WERE ABLE TO REFUTE THE 
     ALIBI.  IN RESPONSE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS PASSED 
     LEGISLATION (IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN 1988, IN GREAT 
     BRITAIN IN 1994) ENABLING A JUDGE TO DIRECT THE 
     JURY THAT IT MAY DRAW AN INFERENCE OF GUILT FROM 
     REFUSAL TO ANSWER REASONABLE QUESTIONS. 
 
--   WIRETAP EVIDENCE IS NOT ADMISSIBLE IN TRIALS IN THE 
     UK, SINCE WIRETAPS DO NOT REQUIRE JUDICIAL REVIEW. 
 
5.   RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: 
 
--   HMG CONTINUED TO COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH THE USG IN 
     TRYING TO PERSUADE LIBYA TO SURRENDER FOR TRIAL THE 
     TWO SUSPECTS IN THE 1988 BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 AND

     ARGENTINE AUTHORITIES IN INVESTIGATING THE BOMBING 
     OF A JEWISH CENTER IN BUENOS AIRES. 
 
--   HMG CONDEMNED PALESTINIAN ATTACKS IN ISRAEL. 
 
--   THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PROVIDE 
     PROTECTION TO AUTHOR SALMAN RUSHDIE, AND TO DEMAND 
     THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT LIFT THE THREAT TO HIS 
     LIFE. 
 
6.   MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS: 
 
--   HMG AND THE IRISH GOVERNMENT COOPERATED IN APPLYING 
     PRESSURE TO PIRA AND LOYALIST TERRORISTS TO ACCEPT 
     THE DECEMBER 1993 DOWNING STREET DECLARATION AND 
     CEASE TERRORISM.  SINCE THE CEASEFIRES, BRITISH 
     OFFICIALS HAVE ENTERED INTO EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE 
     WITH THE PARAMILITARIES, AND SOME RESTRICTIONS ON 
     THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN 
     LIFTED. 
 
--   POLICE AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
     CONTINUED TO CRACK DOWN ON LOYALIST AND REPUBLICAN 
     PROTECTION, FRAUD, SMUGGLING, MONEY-LAUNDERING AND 
     VIDEO PIRATING RACKETS, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MAIN 
     SOURCES OF INCOME FOR TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
--   THE UK PARTICIPATES ACTIVELY IN INTERNATIONAL 
     COUNTERTERRORISM FORA, COORDINATING ITS ACTIVITIES 
     CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. AND OTHERS.  IT ALSO PROVIDES

7.   HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM:

     INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND 
     COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. IN APPLYING 
     PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENTS THAT SUPPORT OR CONDONE 
     TERRORISM.

     SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.  IT HAS NO MISSION IN 
     BAGHDAD, TRIPOLI OR PYONGYANG, AND ONLY A SKELETON 
     STAFF IN TEHRAN. 
 
--   SEVERAL GROUPS AFFILIATED WITH FOREIGN TERRORIST 
     ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN OFFICES IN THE UK, AND ARE 
     PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL AND FUNDRAISING 
     ACTIVITIES AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT VIOLATE BRITISH 
     LAWS, BUT ARE CLOSELY MONITORED. 
 
8.   STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRY: 
 
--   HMG HAS MADE NO SUCH STATEMENTS. 
 
9.   SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1993 IN THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: 
 
--   APART FROM ITS LIMITED DIALOGUE WITH PARTIES 
     AFFILIATED WITH REPUBLICAN AND LOYALIST 
     PARAMILITARY GROUPS SINCE THEIR CEASEFIRES, THERE 
     HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN HMG\'S ADAMANT OPPOSITION TO 
     TERRORISM IN ALL FORMS.

SUMMARY 
------- 
2. (C) SINN FEIN LEADERS HAVE AUTHORITATIVELY RULED OUT 
ANY DECOMMISSIONING OF WEAPONS -- EVEN A SYMBOLIC 
GESTURE -- UNTIL THE SHAPE OF AN ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL 
SETTLEMENT IS CLEAR, AND HAVE DEMANDED THAT HMG 
IMMEDIATELY CONVENE ALL-PARTY TALKS.  THEY SAID THEIR 
EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE WITH HMG WAS FINISHED, BUT LEFT 
OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF MEETINGS WITH BRITISH MINISTERS 
TO PREPARE FOR ALL-PARTY TALKS.  SINN FEIN HAS LAUNCHED 
A CAMPAIGN TO FORGE \"PAN-NATIONALIST\" CONSENSUS BEHIND 
ITS POSITION, AND TO ISOLATE THE UNIONISTS AND HMG. 
 
3. (S) BRITISH OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED BY THE SUCCESS OF 
SINN FEIN\'S CAMPAIGN, BUT UNSURE HOW THEY CAN COUNTER 
IT.  THEY DO NOT WANT THE PEACE PROCESS TO BECOME 
STALLED, AND ARE WORRIED BY INTELLIGENCE INDICATING A 
POTENTIAL SPLIT IN THE IRA IN LATE SUMMER/EARLY AUTUMN. 
THEY WANT TO MOVE ON ISSUES AT THE TOP OF THE REPUBLICAN 
GENDA LIKE PRISONERS AND POLICING, BUT SINN FEIN HAS 
REFUSED TO DISCUSS THEM SERIOUSLY.  THE BRITISH INSIST 
THAT SOME MOVEMENT ON DECOMMISSIONING IS ESSENTIAL IF 
UNIONISTS AND TORY MP\'S ARE TO BE KEPT ON BOARD:  THERE 
CAN BE NO ALL-PARTY TALKS WITHOUT AN UNEQUIVOCAL 
DEMONSTRATION OF IRA INTENT NOT TO RESUME VIOLENCE.  THE 
OPPOSITION LABOUR PARTY STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS VIEW. 
 
4. (S) THE BRITISH ARE LESS WORRIED THAN THEIR IRISH 
COUNTERPARTS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A BREAKDOWN IN THE 
PEACE PROCESS.  THEY BELIEVE THE IRA WOULD HAVE LITTLE 
COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR A FULL-SCALE RETURN TO TERRORISM 
AND THAT A DEFECTION OF ONE OR MORE IRA BRIGADES COULD 
BE CONTAINED.  THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT THEIR POSITION ON 
DECOMMISSIONING IS BOTH RIGHT AND POLITICALLY 
DEFENSIBLE, AND THAT THEY HAVE NO FURTHER ROOM TO 
MANEUVER.  IF THE BRITISH PERSIST, SOMETHING WILL HAVE 
TO GIVE:  EITHER SINN FEIN AND THE IRA WILL FIND A WAY 
TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO NONVIOLENCE, OR THE 
PEACE PROCESS WILL BREAK DOWN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NO TO DECOMMISSIONING 
--------------------- 
5. (U) SINN FEIN OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN SIGNALING FOR OVER 
A MONTH THAT THE IRA WOULD NOT DECOMMISSION ITS ARMS 
UNTIL POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS PRODUCED A BLUEPRINT FOR 
IRELAND\'S FUTURE THAT IT FOUND ACCEPTABLE.  IN A LONG 
ARTICLE IN THE JUNE 14 \"IRISH TIMES\" (REF A), GERRY 
ADAMS MADE IT OFFICIAL: 
 
--   \"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS DEMANDING THE SURRENDER 
     OF IRA WEAPONS AS A PRECONDITION TO ALL-PARTY PEACE 
     TALKS ON THE FUTURE OF IRELAND.  THE LOGIC OF THAT 
     POSITION, IF ADHERED TO, IS THAT THERE WILL BE NO 
     INCLUSIVE PEACE TALKS AND NO DEMOCRATIC SETTLEMENT.\" 
 
--   \"IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS 
     SIMPLY ASKING FOR A SYMBOLIC GESTURE.  BUT IT IS A 
     GESTURE WHICH WOULD SYMBOLIZE AN IRA SURRENDER.... 
     THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS, IN EFFECT, DEMANDING THE 
     SURRENDER OF THE IRA.\" 
 
--   \"SINN FEIN CANNOT, AND WILL NOT, INVOLVE ITSELF IN 
     A FUTILE EXERCISE TO BRING ABOUT AN IRA SURRENDER.\" 
 
6. (U) IN A SERIES OF ARTICLES, SPEECHES AND INTERVIEWS 
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS, ADAMS AND OTHER SINN FEIN 
LEADERS REPEATED THIS MESSAGE ENDLESSLY.  ON JUNE 17, 
ADAMS TOLD AN INTERVIEWER THAT A RETURN TO VIOLENCE WAS 
\"ABSOLUTELY\" POSSIBLE, BUT DENIED THE NEXT DAY THAT HE 
HAD INTENDED THIS STATEMENT AS A THREAT.  MARTIN 
MCGUINNESS MADE THE SAME POINTS IN THE ANNUAL WOLFE TONE 
COMMEMORATION SPEECH JUNE 18 (REF B), CALLING HMG\'S 
INSISTENCE ON AT LEAST TOKEN DECOMMISSIONING \"DANGEROUS 
AND DISHONORABLE,\" AND A \"CYNICAL GAME.\"  ADAMS AND 
MCGUINNESS INSISTED THAT SINN FEIN AND THE IRA WERE 
WILLING TO COUNTENANCE DISARMAMENT, BUT ONLY AS PART OF 
A \"UNIVERSAL DECOMMISSIONING OF ARMS, BRITISH AND IRISH, 
ONCE AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING POLITICAL DISCUSSION AND 
FRAMEWORK IS AGREED UPON.\" 
 
DEMAND FOR ALL-PARTY TALKS 
-------------------------- 
7. (U) THE SINN FEIN LEADERS ALSO CONFIRMED THAT THEY 
WOULD NOT AGREE TO ANY MORE \"EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE\" 
MEETINGS WITH BRITISH MINISTERS.  NATIONAL CHAIRMAN 
MITCHEL MCLAUGHLIN TOLD THE BBC ON JUNE 12 THAT \"WE 
BELIEVE THAT WE\'VE COVERED THOSE ISSUES WHICH WERE 
RELEVANT AND LEGITIMATE AND NOW IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON TO 
A COMMITMENT TO OPEN ALL-PARTY TALKS.\"  MCGUINNESS MADE 
THE SAME POINTS IN HIS JUNE 18 SPEECH. 
 
8.   ADAMS, IN HIS \"IRISH TIMES\" ARTICLE AND WEEKEND 
INTERVIEWS FROM SOUTH AFRICA, ADDED THAT: 
 
--   \"ALL-PARTY PEACE TALKS SHOULD BE INITIATED AS A 
     MATTER OF URGENCY AND WITHIN AN AGREED TIME FRAME.\" 
 
--   \"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO 
     DICTATE THE TERMS OF THIS ACCOMMODATION, NOR CAN IT 
     BE ALLOWED TO DETERMINE WHO CAN OR CANNOT 
     PARTICIPATE IN THE NEGOTITIONS....\" 
 
--   \"... THE BRITISH HAVE, AS EVER, USED THE CONVENIENT 
     COVER OF THE UNIONISTS.  IN DOING SO THEY ARE 
     ENCOURAGING, RATHER THAN DISCOURAGING, UNIONIST 
     INTRANSIGENCE.\" 
 
A FEW LOOPHOLES 
--------------- 
9. (C) DESPITE THE CATEGORICAL TONE OF THE SINN FEIN 
STATEMENTS, IT MAY PROVE SIGNIFICANT THAT THEY LEFT OPEN 
A FEW LOOPHOLES THROUGH WHICH THE PARTY MIGHT EVENTUALLY 
SLIDE OFF ITS HARD-LINE POSITION.  THE REJECTIONS OF 
DECOMMISSIONING GENERALLY SET UP A STRAW MAN TO ATTACK: 
ADAMS AND MCGUINNESS REJECTED A UNILATERAL SURRENDER OF 
ALL IRA WEAPONS BEFORE TALKS COULD BEGIN, KNOWING FULL 
WELL THAT THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DO. 
 
10. (C) ON DIALOGUE, THE SINN FEIN LEADERS CAREFULLY 
ALLOWED FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS 
UNDER ANOTHER NAME.  SINCE HMG IS ALREADY CONDUCTING ITS 
TALKS WITH BOTH UNIONIST PARTIES UNDER VARIOUS DODGES 
AND LINGUISTIC SUBTERFUGES, THIS NEED NOT BE AN 
INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO CONTINUING THE EXPLORATORY 
DIALOGUE UNDER A NEW NAME. 
 
PAN-NATIONALIST CAMPAIGN 
------------------------ 
11. (C) SINN FEIN\'S LOBBYING CAMPAIGN TO GENERATE A 
\"PAN-NATIONALIST CONSENSUS\" IN SUPPORT OF ITS POSITION 
HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.  IT ECHOES THE 
PATTERN OF PREVIOUS CAMPAIGNS FOR VISAS AND FUNDRAISING 
PERMISSION, SEEKING FIRST TO WIN OVER SDLP LEADER JOHN 
HUME, IRISH OFFICIALS AND FIANNA FAIL, THEN PUTTING 
PRESSURE THROUGH THEM ON JOHN BRUTON AND DICK SPRING. 
HUME APPEARS TO BE ON BOARD, THOUGH SDLP DEPUTY LEADER 
SEAMUS MALLON URGED THE IRA ON JUNE 16 TO \"DO THIS THING 
ON DECOMMISSIONING FOR THE REST OF US, FOR THE IRISH 
PEOPLE AND CALL THE BRITISH BLUFF.\"  REFS C-E INDICATE 
THAT IRISH OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN WON OVER.  SPRING AND 
BRUTON HAVE WAVERED, AND MEDIA REPORTS INDICATE THAT 
BRUTON HAS PROPOSED AN ANGLO-IRISH STUDY OF MODALITIES 
OF DECOMMISSIONING, PRESUMABLY AS A DELAYING TACTIC. 
 
12. (U) A KEY PART OF THE CAMPAIGN IS TO CREATE A 
CLIMATE OF OPINION THAT THE BRITISH AND UNIONIST DEMANDS 
DO NOT MEAN WHAT THEY SAY, THAT DECOMMISSIONING IS BOTH 
IMPOSSIBLE AND UNREASONABLE, AND THAT HMG IS ISOLATED 
INTERNATIONALLY.  ADAMS WROTE THAT: 
 
--   \"THERE IS NO INTERNATIONAL PRECEDENT AND CERTAINLY 
     NO PRECEDENT IN IRELAND FOR THE HANDING OVER OF 
     WEAPONS.\" 
 
--   \"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ... WISH TO DEFLECT AND 
     DILUTE THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR A 
     DEMOCRATIC AND NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT BY CREATING AN 
     UNNECESSARY AND DIVISIVE ARGUMENT OVER IRA WEAPONS.\" 
 
--   \"THEY MAY, IN FACT, WISH TO CAUSE DIVISIONS AND 
     FRACTIONS WITHIN THE IRA ITSELF IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
     UNDERMINE THE STRENGTH OF THE REPUBLICAN POSITION. 
     IN SHORT, THEY WISH TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO.\" 
 
--   \"THE IRISH GOVERNMENT AND ALL POLITICAL PARTIES 
     WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UNIONISTS HAVE CALLED FOR 
     SUBSTANTIVE NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN.  THE BRITISH 
     GOVERNMENT IS REFUSING TO TAKE THIS ESSENTIAL STEP 
     AND IS PREVENTING PROGRESS TOWARDS AN AGREED AND 
     LASTING POLITICAL SETTLEMENT.\" 
 
13. (U) SIMILARLY, MCLAUGHLIN POINTED TO BRUTON\'S 
INVITATION TO ALL PARTIES TO TALK, AND SAID THIS PROVED 
THAT HMG WAS \"THE OBSTACLE TO AGREEMENT ON PEACE IN 
IRELAND.\"  AND MCGUINNESS CLAIMED THAT \"THE CONCEPT OF 
ALL-PARTY PEACE NEGOTIATIONS IN IRELAND WAS SUPPORTED BY 
AN EXPECTANT AND WATCHING WORLD.  ONLY THE BRITISH 
GOVERNMENT STOOD IN THE WAY OF REAL PEACE TALKS.\" 
 
14. (C) IN ALL THESE STATEMENTS, NONE OF THE SINN FEIN 
SPOKESMEN ACKNOWLEDGED PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S CALL AT THE 
WASHINGTON INVESTMENT CONFERENCE FOR PROGRESS TOWARD 
DECOMMISSIONING, OR FORMER COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR 
ARIAS\' SIMILAR APPEAL FOR PARAMILITARY DISARMAMENT AT A 
RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE IN BELFAST. 
 
BRITISH PERPLEXED 
----------------- 
15. (C) BRITISH MINISTERS AND OFFICIALS HAVE WATCHED THE 
SINN FEIN CAMPAIGN DEVELOP, BUT ARE AT A LOSS HOW BEST 
TO COUNTER IT.  THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR CURRENT POSITION 
IS BOTH REASONABLE, MORALLY RIGHT AND POLITICALLY 
DEFENSIBLE.  THEY POINT OUT THAT: 
 
--   THEY HAVE TAKEN A LONG SERIES OF STEPS TO DEFUSE 
     CONFRONTATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND HAVE 
     MODIFIED THEIR POSITION REPEATEDLY IN ORDER TO 
     FACILITATE COMPROMISE WITH SINN FEIN. 
 
--   SINN FEIN AND THE IRA, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE 
     OFFERED VIRTUALLY NO SIGNS OF FLEXIBILITY SINCE THE 
     CEASEFIRE. 
 
--   GENUINE NEGOTIATIONS CANNOT TAKE PLACE IN AN 
     ATMOSPHERE OF TERRORIST THREAT AND COERCION. 
 
--   THEY DO NOT SEEK A UNILATERAL SURRENDER OF ALL IRA 
     WEAPONS, BUT ONLY A TOKEN DECOMMISSIONING AS A 
     GESTURE OF GOOD FAITH AS PART OF THE BEGINNING OF A 
     PROCESS OF PHASED, RECIPROCAL DISARMAMENT IN WHICH 
     THEY HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THE FIRST STEPS. 
 
--   THEY ARE ASKING NO MORE OF THE IRA THAN THEY ARE OF 
     THE LOYALIST PARAMILITARIES. 
 
--   THEY HAVE NO FURTHER NEGOTIATING LEEWAY.  UNIONISTS 
     OF ALL STRIPES HAVE MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT 
     THEY WILL NOT SIT DOWN WITH SINN FEIN WHILE THE IRA 
     REMAINS ON A WAR FOOTING, AND ABANDONING THE DEMAND 
     FOR SOME DECOMMISSIONING WOULD GIVE NEW IMPETUS FOR 
     TORY BACKBENCH DEMANDS FOR MAJOR\'S RESIGNATION. 
 
16. (C) NORTHERN IRELAND OFFICE (NIO) OFFICIALS TOLD US 
JUNE 15 THAT THEY DID NOT INTEND TO LEAVE ADAMS\' ARTICLE 
UNCHALLENGED, AND WERE PREPARING A REPLY TO IT.  THEY 
HOPED THEY COULD SUSTAIN THE SUPPORT OF BRUTON AND 
SPRING, AS WELL AS THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION. 
 
READY TO MOVE 
------------- 
17. (S) WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CLAIM 
THAT HMG IS TRYING TO STALL PROGRESS ON THE PEACE 
PROCESS, AS SINN FEIN AND SOME IRISH OFFICIALS SUGGEST. 
THE BRITISH ARE ANXIOUS TO SUSTAIN THE MOMENTUM 
GENERATED BY THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE.  THEY HAVE 
OFFERED SINN FEIN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE ANY ISSUE IT 
WANTS IN THE EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE, AND TO MEET WITH ANY 
NIO MINISTER ON APPROPRIATE ISSUES -- PUTTING SINN FEIN 
EFFECTIVELY ON THE SAME FOOTING AS THE NONVIOLENT 
PARTIES.  THEY BELIEVE THE LOYALISTS ARE PREPARED TO 
MOVE ON DECOMMISSIONING IF THE IRA DOES SO.  AND THEY 
ARE READY TO AUTHORIZE THE WITHDRAWAL OF MORE BRITISH 
ARMY BATTALIONS AS SOON AS CONDITIONS PERMIT. 
 
18. (S) THE BRITISH ALSO SHARE THE WORRIES OF THEIR 
IRISH COUNTERPARTS ABOUT A POSSIBLE SPLIT WITHIN THE IRA 
IF THERE IS NO FURTHER PROGRESS BEFORE THE AUGUST 
CEASEFIRE.  INTELLIGENCE REPORTING ON THIS ISSUE IS 
MIXED.  SOME REPORTS INDICATE THAT ONE OR MORE IRA 
BRIGADES MAY DEFECT IN AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER.  OTHER 
REPORTS, HOWEVER, INDICATE THAT SUPPORT FOR THE 
CEASEFIRE IN REPUBLICAN COMMUNITIES CONTINUES TO 
SOLIDIFY, AND THAT THE IRA WOULD FACE GREAT DIFFICULTIES 
IN RESUMING FULL-SCALE VIOLENCE. 
 
19. (C) FOR THIS REASON, THE BRITISH HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
ENGAGE SINN FEIN ON ISSUES PRESUMED TO BE AT THE TOP OF 
ITS AGENDA:  PRISONERS, POLICING, AND ECONOMIC 
REGENERATION.  UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE EXPLORATORY 
DIALOGUE SINN FEIN HAS REFUSED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES 
IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY.  A SENIOR NIO OFFICIAL TOLD US 
JUNE 15 THAT SINN FEIN, WHILE COMPLAINING ABOUT HMG\'S 
\"SINGLE ISSUE AGENDA,\" HAD ITSELF REFUSED TO DISCUSS ANY 
SUBJECT EXCEPT DECOMMISSIONING (IN ORDER TO REJECT IT). 
 
20. (S) THE BRITISH, HOWEVER, DO NOT FULLY SHARE THEIR 
IRISH COUNTERPARTS\' SENSE OF URGENCY.  AS NOTED ABOVE, 
THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE THREAT OF A FULL-SCALE 
RESUMPTION OF THE IRA\'S TERRORIST CAMPAIGN IS CREDIBLE 
BECAUSE OF THE TRANSFORMATION IN COMMUNITY ATTITUDES. 
THE DEFECTION OF ONE OR MORE IRA BRIGADES WOULD BE 
UNFORTUNATE, BUT SHOULD BE CONTAINABLE AND NEED NOT 
NECESSARILY END THE PEACE PROCESS.  THEY ARE MORE 
WORRIED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE IRA WOULD CONDUCT 
A PARTIAL RESUMPTION OF ITS BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN GREAT 
BRITAIN ONLY, BUT BELIEVE THAT CAVING IN TO REPUBLICAN 
DEMANDS NOW WOULD BE BOTH FUTILE AND MORE DANGEROUS IN 
THE LONG TERM. 
 
OPPOSITION SUPPORT 
------------------ 
21. (U) JOHN HUME CLAIMED JUNE 19 THAT HMG WAS STALLING 
ON TALKS BECAUSE OF \"INTERNAL SQUABBLING\" OVER THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY.  THIS IS NOT OUR 
ASSESSMENT:  THERE IS NO DISSENT WITHIN THE TORY PARTY 
OVER THE NEED FOR DECOMMISSIONING, AND THE GOVERNMENT 
ALSO ENJOYS STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE MAIN OPPOSITION 
PARTIES.  AFTER MEETING FIANNA FAIL LEADER BERTIE AHERNE 
IN LONDON JUNE 19, LABOUR LEADER TONY BLAIR SAID: 
LABOUR ENTIRELY SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT\'S EMPHASIS ON 
THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPLORATORY DIALOGUE TO AVOID DEADLOCK 
IN THE PEACE PROCESS AND THEIR INSISTENCE THAT, BEFORE 
SUBSTANTIVE TALKS CAN TAKE PLACE, BOTH REPUBLICAN AND 
LOYALIST REPRESENTATIVES MUST ACCEPT THE PRINCIPLE OF 
DECOMMISSIONING OF ARMS, AGREE ON THE MEANS AND SIGNAL 
THE START OF THE PROCESS AS A SIGN OF GOOD FAITH.\"  HE 
HAS MADE SIMILAR STATEMENTS TO THE AMBASSADOR. 
 
22. (C) SHADOW NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY MO MOWLAM 
REITERATED THIS POSITION TO US JUNE 20.  SHE SAID THAT, 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW ON THE FAR LEFT FRINGE OF 
THE PARTY, LABOUR ACCEPTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS 
TAKING THE RIGHT LINE ON THE POLITICS OF NORTHERN 
IRELAND.  IF LABOUR CAME TO POWER IN THE NEAR FUTURE, 
ITS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICIES IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT, BUT ITS POLITICAL 
POLICY WOULD BE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE CURRENT ONE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
23. (C) WHILE ALL BRITISH OFFICIALS, AND ALL UNIONIST 
PARTIES, HAVE TOLD US THAT SOME DECOMMISSIONING OF IRA 
ARMS IS ESSENTIAL IF FURTHER PROGRESS IS TO BE MADE, 
MOST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DECOMMISSIONING PER SE IS NOT THE 
REAL ISSUE.  POLICE AND ARMY OFFICIALS HAVE ADMITTED, 
MORE OR LESS PUBLICLY, THAT THE IRA COULD EASILY REPLACE 
ANY TOKEN AMOUNT OF AGING WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES IT 
CHOSE TO GIVE UP AT THIS POINT.  ITS MOST DAMAGING 
ATTACKS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE EMPLOYED HOMEMADE WEAPONS, 
ON WHICH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES.  BUT 
GETTING RID OF ANY AMOUNT OF WEAPONS, HOWEVER OBSOLETE, 
WOULD CONSTITUTE THE FIRST GENUINE DEMONSTRATION OF THE 
INTENT OF THE CURRENT IRA LEADERSHIP NOT TO RESUME THE 
ARMED CONFLICT.  AS CHURCH OF IRELAND PRELATE ROBIN 
EAMES TOLD THE DUBLIN PEACE FORUM RECENTLY, THE KEY IS 
FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO FOSTER A CLIMATE OF TRUST \"BY 
SHOWING THAT WE CAN BELIEVE YOUR WORDS.\" 
 
24. (C) WE CAN SEE SEVERAL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF THE 
CURRENT STALEMATE: 
 
--   SINN FEIN AND THE IRA COULD CONCLUDE THAT 
     DECOMMISSIONING WAS ESSENTIAL AND BEGIN THE 
     PROCESS.  THIS WOULD BE DIFFICULT INTERNALLY, AND 
     MIGHT RESULT IN SOME DEFECTIONS, BUT WOULD UNLOCK THE 
     DOOR TO RAPID MOVEMENT ON SEVERAL OTHER FRONTS. 
 
--   THE REPUBLICANS COULD FIND AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF 
     DEMONSTRATING THEIR INTENT TO END VIOLENCE FOR 
     GOOD.  THEY COULD CONVENE A GENERAL ARMY CONVENTION 
     TO DECLARE AN END TO THE ARMED STRUGGLE, OR ISSUE A 
     UNANIMOUS PROVISIONAL ARMY COUNCIL STATEMENT TO THE 
     SAME EFFECT.  THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE ENOUGH TO 
     RENDER THE WEAPONS ISSUE IRRELEVANT IN MOST EYES, 
     BUT MIGHT BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR REPUBLICAN 
     ACTIVISTS TO ACCEPT. 
 
--   THE IRA COULD USE THE IMPASSE AS A PRETEXT TO 
     RESUME ITS ARMED CAMPAIGN.  THIS IS UNLIKELY, 
     BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY REACTION WOULD RISK FAILURE 
     AND COLLAPSE.  MORE LIKELY WOULD BE A LIMITED 
     NUMBER OF DEMONSTRATION BOMBINGS IN ENGLAND. 
 
--   HMG COULD CAVE IN, DROP ITS INSISTENCE ON 
     DECOMMISSIONING AND CALL ALL-PARTY TALKS.  THE 
     UNIONISTS WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY REJECT NOT ONLY THE 
     TALKS BUT ANY FURTHER DEALINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, 
     AND THEIR FRIENDS ON THE TORY BACKBENCHES WOULD 
     REBEL, THUS BRINGING TO AN ABRUPT END THE POLITICAL 
     PROCESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND POSSIBLY THE MAJOR 
     GOVERNMENT. 
 
--   THE STALEMATE COULD CONTINUE FOR MANY MONTHS.  IF 
     THE CEASEFIRE HELD (BY NO MEANS A SURE BET), 
     UNIONISTS MIGHT EVENTUALLY ACCEPT SINN FEIN\'S 
     COMMITMENT TO PEACE AND HMG COULD MOVE TOWARD 
     ALL-PARTY TALKS.  SINN FEIN COULD TRUMPET THIS AS A 
     VICTORY, BUT THE RISKS OF LOST MOMENTUM AND RISING 
     ANGER ON BOTH SIDES WOULD BE VERY SEVERE.

SUBJECT:  LEADER OF SUDANESE OPPOSITION SEEKS USG SUPPORT 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  LEADER OF THE SUDANESE OPPOSITION 
COALITION, AL-SAYED EL-MERGHANI, TOLD US SEPTEMBER 15 
THAT OPPOSITION EFFORTS WILL PRODUCE THE DOWNFALL OF THE 
NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) REGIME IN KHARTOUM. 
 
--  TO FURTHER THIS EFFORT, EL-MERGHANI ASKED THE USG TO 
\"ENCOURAGE\" REGIONAL LEADERS TO LEND SUPPORT TO SUDANESE 
OPPOSITION GROUPS.  WE RESPONDED THAT THE U.S. WOULD NOT 
INTERFERE WITH INTERNAL MATTERS IN SUDAN, BUT AGREED TO 
PASS ON HIS REQUEST.  PLEASE NOTE ACTION REQUEST, 
PARAGRAPH 11. 
 
--  REGARDING TERRORIST ACTIVITY, EL-MERGHANI SAID HE IS 
SURE THE NOTORIOUS BIN LADEN REMAINS IN SUDAN.  HE 
ACCUSED THE GOS OF COMPLICITY IN THE ASSASSINATION 
ATTEMPT ON PRESIDENT MUBARAK. 
 
--  EL-MERGHANI NOTED EVIDENCE OF SUPPORT FROM BOTH IRAN 
AND IRAQ FOR THE NIF, CITING NIF LEADER TURABI\'S 
PARTICULARLY CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  AFRICA WATCHER MET IN LONDON ON SEPTEMBER 15 WITH 
LEADER OF THE SUDANESE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY (DUP) 
AND HEAD OF THE COUNTRY\'S OPPOSITION COALITION, AL-SAYED 
MOHAMED OSMAN EL-MERGHANI.  ALTHOUGH EL-MERGHANI SPEAKS 
SOME ENGLISH, HE USUALLY SPOKE IN ARABIC, WHICH HIS 
AIDE, A. HADI (A SECURITY CONSULTANT BASED IN THE 
BRITISH MIDLANDS), TRANSLATED.  MERGHANI WORE CEREMONIAL 
BLACK ROBES AND A TURBAN. 
 
 
OPPOSITION GOALS 
---------------- 
 
4.  EL-MERGHANI NOTED THAT THE DUP HAD JUST COMPLETED 
THE LONDON MEETING OF ITS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THAT DAY. 
THE PARTY HAD RESOLVED THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUPPORT 
FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE DUP WILL BEGIN TO 
LOBBY SUDANESE IN EXILE FOR SUPPORT.  IN PARTICULAR, 
EL-MERGHANI SAID, THE OPPOSITION IS SEEKING TO ESTABLISH 
A RADIO STATION.  AT THE SAME TIME, OPPOSITIONISTS WILL 
SEEK SUPPORT FROM DISGRUNTLED MEMBERS OF THE SUDANESE 
MILITARY.  IN ADDITION TO GENERAL FATIH AHMED ALI, SOME 
COMMANDERS IN BORDER AREAS ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THE 
OPPOSITION. 
 
5.  ASKED FOR HIS PROGNOSIS, EL-MERGHANI SAID HE 
BELIEVED SUDAN WILL AVOID SOMALIA\'S FATE, AND THAT THE 
SUDANESE PEOPLE WILL \"TOPPLE\" THE NIF REGIME.  BUT THE 
GOS WILL NEVER FALL ON ITS OWN.  THE CURRENT SPATE OF 
DEMONSTRATIONS ARE THE FIRST HINT OF THAT KIND OF 
EFFORT.  YET FOREIGN AFFAIRS SECRETARY EL-SADDIN HAS 
SAID THAT IF THE GOS FALLS, HE WILL MAKE THE COUNTRY 
UNGOVERNABLE, EL-MERGHANI TOLD US.  AND IF THE 
GOVERNMENT FALLS AND THE OPPOSITION COMES TO POWER, 
EL-MERGHANI BELIEVES SIXTH-COLUMNISTS FROM THE NIF WILL 
POSE A SERIOUS DANGER TO ITS STABILITY, ALONG WITH 
TERRORISTS WHOM THE NIF REGIME HAS SUPPORTED. 
 

REQUEST FOR USG SUPPORT 
----------------------- 
 
6.  EL-MERGHANI SAID THE SUDANESE OPPOSITION DID NOT 
WANT INTERVENTION FROM THE U.S. OR NEIGHBORING STATES, 
BUT HOPED FOR SUPPORT.  IN PARTICULAR, HE ASKED THE U.S. 
TO \"ENCOURAGE\" NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES -- HE MENTIONED 
EGYPT, SAUDI ARABIA AND THE GULF STATES IN PARTICULAR -- 
TO LEND SUPPORT TO THE OPPOSITION.  FOR IF THE 
PPOSITION DOES NOT SUCCEED IN OVERTHROWING THE NIF 
REGIME, EL-MERGHANI ARGUED, THE AREA WILL REMAIN 
UNSTABLE.  IN RESPONSE, WE SAID THE U.S. WILL NOT 
INTERVENE IN, NOR INTERFERE WITH THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS 
OF, SUDAN.  WE WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR GREATER 
RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND TO SEEK A REGIONAL 
SOLUTION TO INSTABILITY IN THE REGION.  THAT SAID, WE 
AGREED TO CONVEY EL-MERGHANI\'S REQUEST BACK TO 
WASHINGTON. 
 
 
GOS SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM 
------------------------- 
 
7.  ASKED ABOUT KHARTOUM\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, 
EL-MERGHANI REPLIED THAT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF GOS SUPPORT 
FOR TERRORISM IS ITS OPERATION OF VARIOUS ISLAMIC 
\"SALVATION GROUPS.\"  MANY OF THE MID-LEVEL MANAGERS OF 
THESE GROUPS ARE EITHER SAUDI ARABIAN OR LIBYAN, THOUGH 
MOST OF THE FIELD WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY PALESTINIAN. IN 
ADDITION, MANY APPARENTLY PRIVATE FIRMS IN SUDAN ARE 
ACTUALLY FUND-RAISING FRONTS FOR TERRORISTS, MOSTLY USED 
FOR ACQUIRING WEAPONS, HE ADDED.  THE NOTORIOUS OSAMA 
BIN LADIN REMAINS IN KHARTOUM, EL-MERGHANI MAINTAINED. 
HE NOTED THAT A REPRESENTATIVE OF AN IRANIAN-FUNDED 
ISLAMIC FRONT GROUP, A SAUDI CITIZEN NAMED (FNU) 
MASSARI, IS CURRENTLY IN THE UK UNDER BIN LADIN\'S 
DIRECTION; HE SAID HE HAD TOLD HMG OF THIS. 
 
 
RELATIONS WITH EGYPT, IGADD 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  ASKED ABOUT THE MUBARAK ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, 
EL-MERGHANI ACCUSED THE GOS OF INVOLVEMENT IN IT, ADDING 
HE BELIEVED IT WOULD CAUSE A SHAKE UP IN EGYPTIAN 
SECURITY.  IN HIS VIEW, MANY ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS HAD 
INFILTRATED THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING ITS 
SECURITY APPARATUS.  HE BLAMED LACK OF SAUDI SUPPORT ON 
SIMILAR INFILTRATION BY ISLAMISTS.  HADI, EL-MERGHANI\'S 
ASSISTANT, LATER ADDED THAT THE EGYPTIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER\'S SUDANESE DESK RECENTLY UNDERWENT A PERSONNEL 
UPHEAVAL AS A RESULT OF GOE SECURITY MEASURES, RESULTING 
IN IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN CAIRO AND THE 
SUDANESE OPPOSITION.  EL-MERGHANI ALSO APPLAUDED EGYPT\'S 
REDUCTION OF DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN SUDAN.  ASKED ABOUT 
PROSPECTS FOR IGADD BROKERING A REGIONAL SETTLEMENT, 
EL-MERGHANI CALLED THE NIF REGIME \"EVIL\" AND INCAPABLE 
OF AGREEING TO PEACE. 
 
 
TURABI AND ISLAMISM 
------------------- 
 
9.  AT THE CENTER OF THE NIF REGIME IS TURABI, 
EL-MERGHANI CONTINUED, WHO HAS CLOSE TIES TO IRAN AND 
IRAQ.  THE NIF RECEIVES MANY DONATIONS FROM IRANIAN 
FRONT ORGANIZATIONS, PARTICULARLY THE WRETCHED OF THE 
EARTH, MANY OF WHICH EARN LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THROUGH 
THEIR OPERATION OF HOTELS IN TEHRAN.  THESE 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEGUN TO ANNOUNCE \"A GREAT 
LEAP,\" WHICH EL-MERGHANI BELIEVES MUST REFER TO PLANNED 
ATTACKS ON FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR OFFICIALS. 
 
10.  TURABI HAS LONG HAD A CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH SADDAM 
HUSSEIN, EL-MERGHANI SAID.  TURABI URGED SADDAM TO 
INVADE KUWAIT, AND ADVISED SADDAM TO INVOKE THE KORAN 
DURING THE GULF WAR AND AFTER.  MORE RECENTLY, 
EL-MERGHANI SAID HE HAD HEARD FROM \"EYE-WITNESSES\" THAT 
TURABI HAS SAID THAT MUBARAK AND SAUDI ARABIAN KING FAHD 
\"MUST GO.\"  TURABI HAS ALSO DEVELOPED CLOSE CONTACT WITH 
ISLAMISTS IN QATAR.  EL-MERGHANI SAID HE BELIEVES TURABI 
PLANNED A SERIES OF ISLAMIST COUPS THROUGHOUT THE GULF 
REGION, THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BRING HIM ENORMOUS POWER 
BEHIND THE SCENES.  FOR THIS REASON, EL-MERGHANI 
CONCLUDED, HE BELIEVES THAT TURABI HAS BECOME 
MEGALOMANIACAL.  IN CLOSING, HE ASKED TO MEET AMBASSADOR 
CARNEY EITHER IN LONDON OR CAIRO AT SOME MUTUALLY 
AGREEABLE TIME, AND TO RECOMMEND A CONTACT AT EMBASSY 
CAIRO. 
 
 
COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST 
-------------------------- 
 
11.  EL-MERGHANI IS A SERIOUS INTERLOCUTOR, THOUGH IT 
MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SUBSTANTIATE ALL HIS VIEWS.  WE 
BELIEVE WE SHOULD REPLY TO HIS REQUEST FOR USG 
ENCOURAGEMENT OF NEIGHBORING STATES IN HIS CAUSE\'S 
BEHALF.  WHILE WE BELIEVE THE USG CANNOT OFFER SUCH 
ENCOURAGEMENT, WE COULD OFFER TO KEEP IN CLOSE TOUCH 
INSTEAD, PROBABLY IN CAIRO (WHERE HE SPENDS MOST OF THE 
YEAR).  ACTION REQUEST:  PLEASE PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO 
REPLY TO EL-MERGHANI\'S REQUEST.  NOTE:  EL-MERGHANI WILL 
REMAIN IN LONDON UNTIL LATE SEPTEMBER; AFRICA WATCHER 
CAN CONVEY USG RESPONSE VIA EL-MERGHANI\'S AIDE.

SUBJECT:  MURDER OF QADHAFI OPPONENT IN LONDON 
 
1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY:  MICHAEL J. HABIB, 
MINISTER-COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS.  REASON: 1.5(D). 
 
2.  (U)  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, AN EXILED OPPONENT 
OF QADHAFI\'S REGIME WAS FOUND STABBED TO DEATH IN HIS 
WEST LONDON GROCER\'S SHOP ON SUNDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 
26.  FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS OF ALI MEHMED ABU ZEID HAVE 
BEEN QUICK TO SUGGEST THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED 
BY LIBYAN SECURITY AGENTS. 
 
3.  (U)  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, ABU ZEID WAS FORCED 
TO LEAVE LIBYA ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO AFTER SERVING 
EIGHT MONTHS IN PRISON FOR ACTIVITIES HOSTILE TO THE 
LIBYAN GOVERNMENT.  A SPOKESMAN FOR SCOTLAND YARD SAID 
INVESTIGATORS WERE \"KEEPING AN OPEN MIND\" ABOUT THE 
OTIVE WHILE NOTING THAT THE CRIME DID NOT APPEAR TO 
INVOLVE BURGLARY.  HOWEVER, A POLICE SOURCE TOLD THE 
PRESS THAT A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED KILLING WOULD MORE 
LIKELY HAVE INVOLVED A SHOOTING OR BOMBING, AND NOT, AS 
IN THIS CASE, A GRUESOME MULTIPLE STABBING.  (ACCORDING 
TO TABLOID ACCOUNTS, ABU ZEID WAS STABBED IN THE BACK AT 
HIS STORE\'S ENTRANCE AND THEN DISEMBOWELED OVER THE 
HALAL MEAT COUNTER AT THE REAR OF THE SHOP.) 
 
4.  (C)  A CONTACT ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIBYAN OPPOSITION 
TOLD POLOFF ON NOVEMBER 28 THAT ABU ZEID WAS AN 
EXTREMELY WELL-LIKED FIGURE IN THE LOCAL LIBYAN 
COMMUNITY.  HE CLAIMED THAT ABU ZEID WAS NOT INVOLVED IN 
THE EMOTIONAL INTERNECINE DISPUTES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE 
LIBYAN OPPOSITION MOVEMENT AND THAT HE MAINTAINED GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH EVERYONE.  ABU ZEID HAD NOT BEEN 
POLITICALLY ACTIVE SINCE THE LATE EIGHTIES AND HE HAD 
\"NO ENEMIES EXCEPT THE QADHAFI REGIME\". 
 
5.  (C)  OUR SOURCE CLAIMED THAT ABU ZEID HAD RECENTLY 
RECEIVED THREATENING PHONE CALLS AND HAD MOVED HIS 
FAMILY WITHIN THE LAST TEN DAYS.  HE HAD TOLD FRIENDS 
THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HIM, LIBYAN SECURITY 
OFFICIALS WERE TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.  LIBYAN 
OPPOSITIONISTS WERE CONVINCED ABU ZEID HAD BEEN TARGETED 
PRECISELY BECAUSE HE WAS WELL-KNOWN AND WIDELY LIKED AND 
THUS HIS MURDER, PARTICULARLY WHEN CARRIED OUT IN SUCH A 
BRUTAL FASHION, WOULD HAVE A DEEPLY CHILLING EFFECT ON 
LIBYAN EXPATRIATES EVERYWHERE. 
 
6.  (C)  SCOTLAND YARD WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FOLLOW ANY LEAD 
SUGGESTING A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED CRIME.  POST WILL 
REPORT ANY INDICATION OF OFFICIAL LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN 
THE MURDER OF ABU ZEID.

SUBJECT: ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT - UK 
 
REF: STATE 202128 
 
1. THE UNITED KINGDOM IS ONE OF THE UNITED STATES\' CLOSEST 
ALLIES AND PARTNERS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  IT ROUTINELY TAKES A ROBUST STANCE AGAINST 
TERRORISM, AND CONTRIBUTES ACTIVELY TO THE WORK OF 
INTERNATIONAL BODIES -- PARTICULARLY THE UNITED NATIONS, THE 
GROUP OF EIGHT (G8) AND THE EUROPEAN UNION -- IN PROMOTING 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE CEASE- 
FIRES IN NORTHERN IRELAND HAVE LESSENED THE INCIDENTS OF 
TERRORISM, ALTHOUGH THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE FROM DISSIDENT 
REPUBLICAN AND LOYALIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS CONTINUES TO BE 
TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY BY AUTHORITIES.  RESPONSES BELOW ARE 
KEYED TO REFTEL PARAGRAPHS. 
 
A) DOMESTIC LEGISLATION AND RESPONSE OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
   --------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. RESPONDING TO THE THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AS 
WELL AS TO TERRORISM ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUBLES IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND, UK COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY HAS DEVELOPED A 
FOCUS ON MEASURES WHICH PROMOTE PRACTICAL TOOLS TO TARGET 
TERRORISM WHEREVER IT ORIGINATES.  THE UK SEEKS TO ENSURE 
CRIMINALS CANNOT EXPLOIT JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES TO ESCAPE 
PROSECUTION AND PUNISHMENT. 
 
3. TWO PIECES OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION HAVE PROVIDED THE 
STATUTORY BASIS FOR THE UK\'S COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS. THE 
\"PREVENTION OF TERRORISM (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT 1989\" IS 
APPLICABLE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IS DIRECTED 
AGAINST BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND TERRORISM CONNECTED WITH 
NORTHERN IRELAND.  IT IS SUBJECT TO REGULAR REVIEW BY 
PARLIAMENT, WHICH MUST RENEW ITS PROVISION ANNUALLY.  IN 
ADDITION, \"THE NORTHERN IRELAND (EMERGENCY PROVISIONS) ACT\" 
GIVES THE GOVERNMENT BROAD ANTI-TERRORISM POWERS IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND. 
 
4. THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY ANTI- 
TERRORISM LEGISLATION IN THE WAKE OF THE BOMBING ATROCITY 
PERPETRATED BY THE \"REAL IRA\" IN AUGUST 1998 IN OMAGH, 
NORTHERN IRELAND.  A SPECIAL SESSION OF PARLIAMENT IN 
SEPTEMBER 1998 PASSED \"THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE (TERRORISM AND 
CONSPIRACY) ACT 1998.\"  UNDER THIS LAW, IT IS NOW AN OFFENSE 
TO CONSPIRE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM TO COMMIT ANY OFFENSE 
(INCLUDING TERRORIST OFFENSES) ABROAD, PROVIDED THE ACTION 
WOULD BE AN OFFENSE BOTH IN BRITAIN AND IN THE COUNTRY IN 
WHICH IT WAS INTENDED TO OCCUR.  THE ACT ALSO ALLOWS A 
STATEMENT BY A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER TO BE ADMISSIBLE AS 
EVIDENCE OF ALLEGED MEMBERSHIP IN AN ILLEGAL TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION, ALTHOUGH FURTHER CORROBORATION IS REQUIRED FOR 
A CONVICTION.  THE ACT ALLOWS THE INFERENCE OF GUILT TO BE 
DRAWN FROM A REFUSAL TO ANSWER A RELEVANT QUESTION DURING 
POLICE INTERVIEWS OR FROM THE REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH ANY 
RELEVANT INQUIRY PROVIDED THAT THE SUSPECT HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT A ATTORNEY.  THE LAW ALSO PERMITS THE 
COURT TO CONFISCATE ASSETS AND PROPERTY OF CONVICTED MEMBERS 
OF PROSCRIBED ORGANIZATIONS WHERE IT DETERMINES THESE ASSETS 
HAVE BEEN, OR MIGHT BE, USED IN FURTHERANCE OF TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES. 
 
5. IN OCTOBER 1997, HOME SECRETARY JACK STRAW ANNOUNCED HIS 
INTENTION TO PUBLISH A CONSULTATION PAPER ON NEW PERMANENT 
UK-WIDE COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION TO REPLACE THE CURRENT 
TEMPORARY PIECEMEAL PROVISIONS.  STRAW RECOGNIZED THAT \"THE 
CEASE-FIRE IN NORTHERN IRELAND ... DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE NO 
LONGER NEED SPECIAL LEGISLATION TO INVESTIGATE, TO DISRUPT 
AND TO COUNTER TERRORISM.  ON THE INTERNATIONAL FRONT THERE 
IS AMPLE EVIDENCE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF TERRORISTS.... SOME 
MAY COMMIT ACTS OF TERRORISM WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM, OR 
RAISE FUNDS HERE, OR OTHERWISE USE THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A 
BASE FROM WHICH TO LAUNCH ATTACKS ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD.\" 
 
6. UNDER THE LEAD OF THE HOME OFFICE, FURTHER 
COUNTERTERRORISM MEASURES ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION AS 
PARLIAMENT AWAITS RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PROMISED 
CONSULTATIVE PAPER \"HOPED\" TO BE PUBLISHED IN EARLY 1999. 
THIS REPORT WILL CONSIDER THE WIDER ASPECTS OF 
COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION, INCLUDING THE NEED FOR 
STRONGER POWERS TO CURB FUNDRAISING BY TERRORIST GROUPS AND 
TO HINDER DOMESTIC ENCOURAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST 
ACTS. 
 
B) EXTRADITION 
   ----------- 
 
7. A U.S. REQUEST FOR THE EXTRADITION OF KHALID AL-FAWWAZ IS 
PENDING IN THE BRITISH COURTS.  AL-FAWWAZ, A SAUDI NATIONAL 
ALLEGED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE USAMAH BIN LADEN ORGANIZATION, 
HAS BEEN IN DETENTION SINCE HIS ARREST BY THE LONDON 
METROPOLITAN POLICE IN OCTOBER 1998.  HE IS WANTED BY U.S. 
AUTHORITIES TO FACE CHARGES FOR CONSPIRING TO MURDER 
AMERICAN CITIZENS BETWEEN JANUARY 1993 AND SEPTEMBER 1998. 
 
8. IN MARCH 1998, THE HOME SECRETARY, CITING MEDICAL 
GROUNDS, DECLINED TO EXTRADITE ROISIN MCALISKEY TO GERMANY 
TO STAND TRIAL FOR OFFENSES RELATED TO A 1996 IRA ATTACK ON 
A BRITISH MILITARY FACILITY IN GERMANY. 
 
C) IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION 
   ----------------------------------------- 
 
9.  THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL OR POLITICAL IMPEDIMENTS 
TO UK PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
D) RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION 
   -------------------------------- 
 
10. (U) ON 21 SEPTEMBER 1998 BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TONY 
BLAIR REITERATED BRITAIN\'S COMMITMENT TO COMBATING GLOBAL 
TERRORISM IN HIS ADDRESS TO THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY, SAYING 
\"[E]ACH [TERRORIST ATROCITY] IS A REMINDER THAT TERRORISM IS 
A UNIQUELY BARBARIC AND COWARDLY CRIME.  EACH ONE IS A 
REMINDER THAT TERRORISTS ARE NO RESPECTERS OF BORDERS.  EACH 
ONE IS A REMINDER THAT TERRORISM SHOULD HAVE NO HIDING PLACE, 
NO OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE FUNDS, NO LET-UP IN OUR DETERMINATION 
TO BRING ITS PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE.\" 
 
E) MAJOR INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS 
   -------------------------------------------- 
 
11. THE UK HAS RATIFIED TEN OF THE ELEVEN UN CONVENTIONS 
RELATING TO TERRORISM.  IN JANUARY 1998, IT SIGNED THE 
ELEVENTH, THE UN CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST 
BOMBING. 
 
12. IN 1998, BRITAIN USED ITS CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE G8 AND 
PRESIDENCY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO HIGHLIGHT TERRORISM 
ISSUES. FOLLOWING THE MAY BIRMINGHAM SUMMIT, G8 FOREIGN 
MINISTERS REAFFIRMED THEIR COLLECTIVE DETERMINATION \"TO 
COMBAT TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS, TO OPPOSE ANY CONCESSION 
TO TERRORIST DEMANDS AND TO PROMOTE COORDINATED 
INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORIST ACTION.\"  THEY IDENTIFIED 
FOUR PRIORITY AREAS FOR FURTHER ACTION: PREVENTING 
TERRORISTS FROM FUNDRAISING IN G8 STATES; UNITING AGAINST 
RANSOM PAYMENTS UNDER A PRINCIPLE OF \"NO CONCESSIONS;\" 
DENYING TERRORISTS ACCESS TO ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES; AND 
STRENGTHENING AVIATION SECURITY. THE G8 FOREIGN MINISTERS, 
LED BY THE UK, ALSO REAFFIRMED THEIR COMMITMENT TO FULL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDED PRACTICES 
AGREED UNDER THE 1944 CHICAGO CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL 
CIVIL AVIATION, AND STRONGLY URGED ALL STATES TO COMPLY. 
 
13. THE BRITISH PRESIDENCY OF THE EU SOUGHT TO REFOCUS EU 
EFFORTS ON COUNTERTERRORISM.  MEASURES IT PROPOSED INCLUDE: 
COMBATING TERRORIST FUNDRAISING IN EU STATES; STRENGTHENING 
COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WITH 
THE EU APPLICANT STATES OF CENTRAL EUROPE AND CYPRUS; 
DEVELOPING EU POLICY GUIDANCE AGAINST EXTORTION OR RANSOM 
DEMANDS; AND IMPROVED COORDINATION OF EU NATIONAL CRISIS 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. 
 
14.  THE UK HOSTED A US-EU SUMMIT IN LONDON IN MAY 1998 
WHICH TOUCHED UPON BILATERAL COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION. 
IT ALSO CONVENED A MEETING IN DECEMBER 1998 OF 
COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERTS REPRESENTING THE G8 MEMBERS AS WELL 
AS THE EU PRESIDENCY AND EU COMMISSION TO REVIEW MEASURES ON 
TERRORIST FUND RAISING. 
 
15. BRITAIN AND THE U.S. REMAIN RESOLVED TO BRING TO JUSTICE 
THE TWO LIBYANS ACCUSED OF BOMBING PAN AM FLIGHT 103 OVER 
LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND.  TO REMOVE ANY PLAUSIBLE JUSTIFICATION 
LIBYA MIGHT CITE FOR FAILING PRODUCE THE SUSPECTS, THE U.S. 
AND UK IN AUGUST 1998 PROPOSED AN INITIATIVE WHICH WOULD 
PERMIT THE ACCUSED TO BE TRIED BEFORE A SCOTTISH COURT 
SITTING IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE TRIAL, CONDUCTED BY A PANEL 
OF JUDGES, WILL BE FAIR IN EVERY RESPECT AND ARRANGEMENTS 
WILL BE MADE FOR INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  THE TWO 
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE UN SECRETARY 
GENERAL AND THROUGH HIS OFFICES HAVE ENSURED THE LIBYAN 
GOVERNMENT UNDERSTANDS THE TERMS OF THIS GENUINE INITIATIVE. 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AWAITS DELIVERY BY LIBYA OF THE 
ACCUSED FOR TRIAL AS DEMANDED BY UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTIONS SO THIS DECADE-OLD WOUND CAN BE BROUGHT TO 
CLOSURE. 
 
F-G) SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM OR GOVERNMENT SPONSORS TERRORISM 
     --------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
16. NONE. 
 
H) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES 
   ------------------- 
17. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE APRIL 1998 GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT, 
NEGOTIATED BY THE NORTHERN IRELAND POLITICAL PARTIES UNDER 
THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF SENATOR GEORGE MITCHELL, THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS AGREED TO MAKE PRISONERS CONVICTED OF TERRORIST CRIMES 
IN NORTHERN IRELAND ELIGIBLE FOR AN EARLY RELEASE PROGRAM. 
THE RELEASES ASSUME THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS TO WHICH THE 
PRISONERS BELONG WILL MAINTAIN THEIR CEASE-FIRES.  SHOULD 
THE PRISONERS ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES UPON RELEASE, 
THEIR \"LICENSE\" COULD BE REVOKED.  ALTHOUGH THIS HAS BEEN 
CONTROVERSIAL IN MANY SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND, THE GOVERNMENT EMPHASIZES THE PROGRAM IS AN 
ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE NEGOTIATION TO ACHIEVE A LASTING 
PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND DOES NOT SIGNIFY A GENERAL 
AMNESTY OR SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO COMMIT ACTS OF TERROR. 
 
I-K)  COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION 
      ---------------------------- 
 
18. AT ALL LEVELS AND IN ALL FIELDS, BRITISH AND AMERICAN 
OFFICIALS WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER ON THE FIGHT AGAINST 
TERRORISM.  CLOSE COOPERATION BASED ON INTENSIVE COORDINATION 
AND CONSULTATION IS THE NORM.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, UK 
SUBJECT: UNITED KINGDOM: 1999 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 204472 
 
 
1.  THE UNITED KINGDOM IS ONE OF THE UNITED STATES\' CLOSEST ALLIES 
AND PARTNERS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IT 
ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTES TO THE WORK OF INTERNATIONAL BODIES, 
INCLUDING THE UN, THE GROUP OF EIGHT (G8), AND THE EUROPEAN UNION 
IN PROMOTING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM.  IN 
DECEMBER, THE BLAIR GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED A NEW, PERMANENT, UK- 
WIDE ANTI-TERRORISM LAW TO REPLACE LAWS WHICH HAD BEEN ADOPTED 
OVER THE YEARS IN RESPONSE TO TERRORISM RELATING TO NORTHERN 
IRELAND.  THE LAW INCLUDES MEASURES TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL AND 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM. 
 
A)  RESPONSE OF UK JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM: DURING 1999, HMG INVOKED EXISTING COUNTERTERRORISM 
LEGISLATION TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST AND/OR PROSECUTED A NUMBER OF 
INDIVIDUALS SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
IN FEBRUARY, 79 INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED UNDER THE PREVENTION OF 
TERRORISM ACT AFTER ILLEGALLY OCCUPYING THE GREEK EMBASSY IN 
LONDON IN PROTEST AT THE ARREST IN ATHENS OF PKK LEADER OCALAN. 
THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CHARGED AND CONVICTED UNDER 
THE HMG\'S PUBLIC ORDER ACT.   IN MARCH, THREE ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS, 
ABU HAMZA, AL SIRRI AND \'FRANK\', WERE ARRESTED UNDER THE 
PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT.  THE POLICE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED 
IN NOVEMBER, AND BAIL CONDITIONS WERE DROPPED.  IN JULY, TWO 
EGYPTIANS, ABDEL ALMAGID BARY AND IBRAHIM HUSSEIN ABDEL HADI 
EIDAROUS, WERE ARRESTED IN RESPONSE TO A U.S. REQUEST FOR THEIR 
EXTRADITION.  THEY REMAIN IN DETENTION PENDING THE COMPLETION OF 
THIS PROCESS. 
 
IN DECEMBER, THE SCOTTISH JUDGE IN THE TRIAL OF TWO LIBYANS 
ACCUSED OF THE 1988 LOCKERBIE BOMBING RULED AGAINST DEFENSE 
MOTIONS THAT CONSPIRACY TO MURDER CHARGES AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS 
BE DROPPED.  AS A RESULT, THE ACCUSED WILL BE TRIED FOR MURDER, 
BREACH OF THE UK AVIATION SECURITY ACT, AND CONSPIRACY.  THE 
RULING OPENS THE WAY FOR THE BROADEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE 
TO BE PUT BEFORE THE COURT AS PART OF THE TRIAL, WHICH IS 
SCHEDULED FOR MAY 2000. 
 
B)  UK RECORD OF EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  THE UK IS 
COOPERATING FULLY WITH THE U.S. REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION OF THREE 
OF THE FIFTEEN INDIVIDUALS INDICTED IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF 
NEW YORK ON TERRORISM-RELATED CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1998 
EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM.  KAHLID AL-FAWWAZ, 
WHO SERVED AS USAMA BIN LADEN\'S DE FACTO SPOKESPERSON IN THE UK, 
IS IN DETENTION PENDING EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS IN RESPONSE TO A 
U.S. REQUEST.  TWO EGYPTIANS, ABEL MOHAMMED ABDUL ALMAGID BARY AND 
IBRAHIM HUSSEIN ABDEL HADI EIDAROUS, ALSO REMAIN IN DETENTION 
PENDING EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS TO THE U.S.  IN ADDITION TO THESE 
CASES, HMG IS COOPERATING WITH A FRENCH REQUEST TO EXTRADITE A 
SUSPECTED GIA MEMBER, ALGERIAN RAMDA. 
 
C)  IMPEDIMENTS TO UK PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS:  IT IS HMG POLICY TO PROSECUTE AND/OR EXTRADITE 
SUSPECTED TERORISTS.  HMG PURSUED THIS POLICY WITHIN THE CONTEXT 
OF THE 1951 UN CONVENTION ON REFUGEES AND THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION 
ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR).  THE 1996 ECHR JUDGEMENT IN THE CASE OF 
THE SIKH TERRORIST CHAHAL ESTABLISHED CRITERIA TO BE MET IN CASES 
OF POSSIBLE DEPORTATION. 
 
THE HOME SECRETARY ANNOUNCED IN PARLIAMENT ON JUNE 23, 1999 THAT A 
TECHNICAL ERROR MADE DURING THE ANNUAL RENEWAL OF THE PROTECTION 
OF TERRORISM ACTION MEANT THAT SECTION 16 OF THE ACT HAD NOT BEEN 
IN FORCE FOR A PERIOD FROM MARCH 1998 TO JUNE 1999.  THIS 
TECHNICAL ERROR RESULTING IN THE INDICTMENT AGAINST SUSPECTED GIA 
MEMBER RECHACHI BEING QUASHED. 
 
D)  UK RESPONSES TO TERRORIST INCIDENTS:  HMG CONSISTENTLY 
CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF TERRORISM.  IT MADE A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS IN 
1999 ON SPECIFIC INTERNATIONAL INCIDENTS INCLUDING THE KIDNAP AND 
MURDER OF BRITISH AND OTHER TOURISTS IN UGANDA IN MARCH 1999, AND 
THE KIDNAP AND MURDER OF BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERS IN 
CHECHNYA IN 1998. 
 
THE UK ACTIVELY SUPPORTS BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL INFORMATION- 
SHARING AND COOPERATION TO COMBAT TERRORISM.  IT PROVIDES 
BILATERAL COUNTERTERRORISM ASSISTANCE TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES. 
 
E) MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE UK IN 1999, 
INCLUDING IN INTERNATIONAL FORA: ON DECEMBER 2, THE GOVERNMENT 
INTRODUCED MAJOR NEW COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION.  THE 
LEGISLATION WILL REFORM AND EXTEND LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER 
THE YEARS IN RESPONSE TO TERRORIST THREATS AND INCIDENTS IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE GOVERNMENT EXPECTS THE NEW LAW TO BE PASSED 
BY PARLIAMENT AND GIVEN ROYAL ASSENT BY AUGUST 24, 2000, WHEN ONE 
OF THE EXISTING LAWS, THE EMERGENCY PROVISIONS ACT (EPA) WILL 
AUTOMATICALLY BE REPEALED.  PROVISIONS IN THE EPA THAT APPLY 
SPECIFICALLY TO NORTHERN IRELAND WILL BE EXTENDED UNDER THE NEW 
LAW, BUT ONLY FOR A PERIOD LIMITED TO FIVE YEARS. 
 
THE NEW LAW IS MEANT TO BE PERMANENT, COMPREHENSIVE, AND UK-WIDE. 
IT DOES DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
AND DEFINES TERRORISM TO INCLUDE \"VIOLENCE, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC, 
MEANT TO INTIMIDATE OR COERCE THE GOVERNMENT OR PUBLIC FOR 
POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, OR IDEOLOGICAL ENDS.\"  THE LAW WILL EXTEND 
PROSCRIPTIVE POWERS, CURRENTLY APPLIED TO TERRORIST GROUPS IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND, TO A BROADER LIST OF INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC 
ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS THE LAW TO STRENGTHEN 
CURRENT PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT UK FINANCING OR FINANCIAL 
MECHANISMS BEING USED TO SUPPORT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR 
ACTIVITIES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 
 
THE PRINCIPAL INTERNATIONAL FORA IN WHICH THE UK HAS BEEN ACTIVE 
ON TERRORISM ISSUES IN 1999 HAVE BEEN THE UN, THROUGH THE SIXTH 
COMMITTEE, THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND ALSO 
THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE G8.  THE UK PROVIDED STRONG LEADERSHIP 
ON ANTITERRORISM ISSUES WHILE IT LED THE G8 DURING 1998.  IT 
SUPPORTED THE SEPTEMBER 23 STATEMENT BY THE FIVE PERMANENT MEMBERS 
OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON COMBATING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IT 
HAS COOPERATED FULLY WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS MEANT TO COMBAT 
TERRORISM.  THESE INCLUDE RESOLUTION 1267 (ON SANCTIONS AGAINST 
THE TALIBAN) AND RESOLUTION 1269 (ON TERRORISM). 
 
THE UK HAS RATIFIED TEN OF THE UN CONVENTIONS ON TERRORISM.  IT 
SIGNED THE ELEVENTH, THE CONVENTION ON THE SUPPRESSION OF 
TERRORIST BOMBING, IN JANUARY 1998 AND EXPECTS TO RATIFY THAT 
CONVENTION IN 2000, BASED ON THE NEW COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION 
WHICH SHOULD BE PASSED BY MID-YEAR.  THE UK EXPECTS TO SIGN THE 
CONVENTION ON TERRORISM FINANCING AS SOON AS IT IS OPENED IN 
JANUARY AND TO RATIFY AS SOON AFTERWARDS AS POSSIBLE. 
 
F)  POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, 
TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS:  HMG DOES NOT SUPPORT 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS.  IT IS 
COMMITTED TO PREVENTING THE UK BEING USED AS A BASE FOR TERRORISM. 
THE POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE GIVE PRIORITY TO COUNTERING ANY 
POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN THE UK BY INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISTS, INCLUDING THE ORGANIZATION AND FUNDING OF TERRORIST 
ATTACKS ABROAD.  INFORMATION ABOUT TERRORISM OR SUPPORT FOR 
TERRORISM IS FULLY INVESTIGATED.  WHERE THERE IS CAUSE TO BELIEVE 
THAT UK LAWS MAY HAVE BEEN VIOLATED, INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS ARE 
PROSECUTED. 
 
G)  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES 
ON A TERRORISM ISSUE:  THE UK HAS NOT MADE ANY STATEMENTS IN 
SUPPORT OF U.S.-DESIGNATED STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ON 
TERRORISM-RELATED ISSUES.  DURING 1999, HMG RESTORED FORMAL 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THREE COUNTRIES ON THE U.S. LIST OF 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES, IRAN, SUDAN AND LIBYA. 
 
H)  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HMG\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM: THERE 
HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN HMG\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM DURING 1999. 
THE UK REMAINS RESOLUTELY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM IN ALL FORMS, 
WHATEVER ITS MOTIVATION.  HAVING USED ITS CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE G8 
AND PRESIDENCY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN 1998 TO HIGHLIGHT AND 
PROVIDE LEADERSHIP ON TERRORISM ISSUES, THE UK IS NOW ENCOURAGING 
OTHER COUNTRIES TO ASSUME A LEADERSHIP ROLE. 
 
I)  U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM INITIATIVES PURSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
HMG:  THE UK COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. AT ALL LEVELS ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY AND ACTIVITIES, BOTH BILATERALLY AND 
THROUGH INTERNATIONAL FORA.  WHEN TERRORISM ISSUES COME BEFORE THE 
UN OR ARE ADDRESSED BY THE G8, THE UK CLOSELY COORDINATES ITS 
VIEWS WITH THE U.S. 
 
THE UK AND THE U.S. CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER TO BRING TO 
JUSTICE THE TWO LIBYANS ACCUSED OF BOMBING PAN AM FLIGHT 102 OVER 
LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND IN 1988.  IN AUGUST 1988, THE U.S. AND UK 
INTRODUCED A JOINT INITIATIVE, WHICH WOULD PERMIT THE ACCUSED TO 
BE TRIED BEFORE A SCOTTISH COURT SITUATED IN THE NETHERLANDS.  AS 
A RESULT OF THIS JOINT EFFORT, IN APRIL 1999, THE GOVERNMENT OF 
LIBYA HANDED OVER THE ACCUSED TO THE UN TO AWAIT TRIAL UNDER TERMS 
OF THE INITIATIVE.  THE TRIAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON MAY 
3, 2000, WILL ALLOW THE ACCUSED TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  HMG AND 
THE SCOTTISH EXECUTIVE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH U.S. OFFICIALS 
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON ALL 
ASPECTS OF PLANNING, INCLUDING LEGAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, SUPPORT FOR 
VICTIMS\' FAMILIES AND PUBLIC/PRESS RELATIONS. 
 
J)  COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION 
OF AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR 
INTERESTS:  THE UNITED KINGDOM IS ONE OF THE UNITED STATES\' 
CLOSEST ALLIES AND PARTNERS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  THIS PARTNERSHIP IS REFLECTED IN CLOSE COOPERATION IN 
MEASURES TO PREVENT TERRORISM AND IN RESPONSES TO TERRORISTS ACTS. 
THE U.S. AND UK PARTICIPATE IN REGULAR BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS AND 
JOINT ACTIVITIES. 
 
THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE UK PROVED TO BE 
INVALUABLE TO THE USG IN ITS INVESTIGATION INTO USAMA BIN LADEN 
AND HIS AL-QAEDA ORGANIZATION.  THE U.S. AND UK CONTINUE TO WORK 
CLOSELY TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT KHALID AL-FAWWAZ, ABDEL MOHAMMED 
ABDUL ALMAGID BARY, AND IBRAHIM EIDAROUS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE 
INDICTED IN THE U.S. ON TERRORISM-RELATED CHARGES, ARE 
SUCCESSFULLY EXTRADITED. 
 
THE UK CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE U.S. IN ITS EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE 
SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF ABDELBASET ALI MOHMED AL MEGRAHI AND AL 
AMIN KHALIFA FHIMAH, WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE BOMBING OF PAN 
AM FLIGHT 102 OVER LOCKERBIE, SCOTLAND IN 1998. 
 
THE UK CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. IN THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF U.S. AND BRITISH 
CITIZENS IN YEMEN IN DECEMBER 1998. 
 
K)  COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN PREVENTING ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM: THE U.S. AND THE UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES MAINTAIN A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO PREVENT 
ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS AND/OR INTERESTS IN THE 
UK.  THIS COOPERATION EXTENDS TO UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF 
INFORMATION-SHARING.  THE UK HAS ASSISTED THE U.S. IN ITS 
INVESTIGATION INTO TERRORIST ACTS IN SCOTLAND, KENYA, TANZANIA, 
AND YEMEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO ASSIST THE U.S. AND UK IN THEIR 
EFFORTS TO PREVENT FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS 
AND/OR INTERESTS.

SUBJECT: UNITED KINGDOM: 2000 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 217248 
 
 
1.  THE UNITED KINGDOM CONTINUED ITS AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS 
AGAINST DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN 2000.  IT 
PASSED A NEW TERRORISM LAW THAT GIVES THE GOVERNMENT EXPANDED 
POWERS TO FIGHT BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TERRORISM, AND IT 
CONTINUED ITS CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES TO 
BRING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE. 
 
A.  RESPONSE OF THE UK JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO ACTS OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM DURING 2000:  TWELVE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN CHARGED 
BASED ON THEIR ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE FEBRUARY 7 
HIJACKING OF AN AFGHAN ARIANA AIRLINER THAT LANDED AT 
STANSTED AIRPORT.  THE CHARGES INCLUDE HIJACKING, FALSE 
IMPRISONMENT, POSSESSION OF A FIREARM WITH INTENT TO CAUSE 
FEAR OF VIOLENCE, AND POSSESSION OF EXPLOSIVES.  THEIR TRIAL 
IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON JANUARY 15, 2001.  FOLLOWING A 
U.S.-UK INITIATIVE, THE TRIAL OF TWO LIBYANS CHARGED WITH THE 
BOMBING IN 1988 OF PAN AM 103 OVER LOCKERBIE SCOTLAND BEGAN 
IN MAY 2000 IN A SCOTTISH COURT SITTING IN THE NETHERLANDS. 
THE ACCUSED ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER, BREACH OF THE UK 
AVIATION SECURITY ACT, AND CONSPIRACY.  AT YEAR END, THE 
TRIAL CONTINUES. 
 
IN APRIL, IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM THE UNITED STATES, 
THE GREATER MANCHESTER POLICE CONDUCTED SEARCHES AT TWO 
LOCATIONS IN MANCHESTER IDENTIFIED AS RESIDENCES OF TWO 
INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED HAS HAVING BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH USAMA 
BIN LADEN AND AL-QUEDA.  IN NOVEMBER, TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE 
ARRESTED IN BIRMINGHAM FOR CONSPIRACY TO CAUSE EXPLOSIONS 
UNDER THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT.  THE SUBJECTS, MOINUL 
ABEDIN AND FAISAL MUSTAFA, FACE LIFE IMPRISONMENT IN THE UK 
IF CONVICTED. 
 
DURING 2000, HMG CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATIONS OF TERRORIST 
MURDERS RELATING TO THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  THESE 
INCLUDE THE 1998 BOMBING IN OMAGH, WHICH KILLED 29 PERSONS, 
AND THE MARCH, 1999 MURDER OF ROSEMARY NELSON, A DEFENSE 
LAWYER.  OFFICIALS MADE PUBLIC SOME OF THE INFORMATION THEY 
HAVE COLLECTED ON BOTH CASES AND APPEALED FOR WITNESSES TO 
COME FORWARD WITH EVIDENCE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR SUSPECTS TO 
BE PROSECUTED. 
 
HMG ALSO PRESSES OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO PROSECUTE SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS.  IT CONTINUES TO PURSUE THE CASES OF BRITISH AND 
AMERICAN CITIZENS MURDERED IN YEMEN IN 1998 AND THE MURDER OF 
BRITISH CITIZENS IN UGANDA IN 1999.  IT IS WORKING WITH GREEK 
OFFICIALS TO BRING TO JUSTICE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
MURDER IN ATHENS ON JUNE 8 OF THE BRITISH MILITARY ATTACHE 
BRIGADIER SAUNDERS.  THE 17 NOVEMBER GROUP HAS CLAIMED CREDIT 
FOR THE MURDER.  HMG IS ALSO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF 
YEMEN TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK ON 
THE BRITISH EMBASSY THERE IN OCTOBER, AND WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
OF SAUDI ARABIA RELATIVE TO THE ATTACKS AND MURDER OF BRITISH 
CITIZENS IN THAT COUNTRY. 
 
B.  UK RECORD OF EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  THE UK 
CONTINUES TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH THE UNITED STATES IN REGARD 
TO THE U.S. REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION OF INDIVIDUALS INDICTED 
IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ON TERRORISM-RELATED 
CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE 1998 EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN 
NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM. KHALED AL-FAWWAZ, IBRAHIM HUSSEIN 
ABDEL HADI EIDAROUS, AND ABEL MOHAMMED ABDUL ALMAGID BARY 
HAVE ALL BEEN FOUND BY UK COURTS TO BE SUBJECT TO EXTRADITION 
TO THE U.S.  THEIR APPEALS TO THIS FINDING ARE CURRENTLY 
BEFORE BRITISH COURTS.  HMG IS ALSO COOPERATING WITH A 
REQUEST BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SEEKING THE EXTRADITION OF 
RASHID RAMDA, AN ALGERIAN WANTED IN CONNECTION WITH A SERIES 
OF BOMBINGS IN FRANCE. 
 
C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  IT IS HMG POLICY TO 
PROSECUTE AND/OR EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  HMG PURSUES 
THIS POLICY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS, THE 1951 CONVENTION ON REFUGEES, AND UK ASYLUM 
LAWS.  UNLIKE U.S. LAW, BRITISH LAW DOES NOT GIVE UK 
AUTHORITIES EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION IN TERRORISM CASES. 
 
D.  UK RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION TO TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS:  HMG CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF TERRORISM 
AND PRESSES OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP STRONG 
COUNTERTERRORIST MEASURES.  UK LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE 
WORKING CLOSELY ON THE GROUND WITH BOTH GREEK AND SAUDI 
OFFICIALS TO ASSIST THE HOST GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO ATTACKS ON BRITISH SUBJECTS OR INTERESTS. 
 HMG CONSULTS WITH AND PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO GOVERNMENTS 
THAT ARE PREPARED TO DEVELOP AND PURSUE POLICIES TO FIGHT 
TERRORISM. 
 
E.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY HMG IN 2000: 
 
IN JULY, A NEW UK-WIDE TERRORISM ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW, 
EXTENDING MECHANISMS AND POWERS THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED TO 
DEAL WITH TERRORISM RELATING TO NORTHERN IRELAND TO ALL FORMS 
OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TERRORISM ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM. 
THE LAW, WHICH COMES INTO FORCE IN FEBRUARY 2001, REPLACES 
THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) ACT OF 
1989 AND THE NORTHERN IRELAND (EMERGENCY PROVISIONS) ACT OF 
1996 (AMENDED IN 1998). 
 
THE NEW LAW WILL APPLY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM AND TO 
ALL FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM.  IT WIDENS 
THE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM TO INCLUDE ACTIONS OR THREATS OF 
ACTION THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INFLUENCE THE GOVERNMENT OR 
INTIMIDATE THE PUBLIC TO ADVANCE A POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, OR 
IDEOLOGICAL CAUSE AND THAT INVOLVE SERIOUS VIOLANCE AGAINST A 
PERSON OR SERIOUS DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, ENDANGERS A PERSON\'S 
LIFE, CREATES A SERIOUS RISK TO THE HEALTH OR SAFETY OF THE 
PUBLIC, OR IS DESIGNED TO SERIOUSLY INTERFERE WITH AN 
ELECTRONIC SYSTEM.  THE ACT GIVES THE POLICE SPECIAL ARREST 
POWERS IN TERRORIST CASES AND ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT TO 
PROSCRIBE ORGANIZATIONS CONCERNED WITH ANY FORM OF 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND TO PROSECUTE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATE IN OR SUPPORT SUCH ORGANIZATIONS 
OR THEIR ACTIVITIES.  THE LAW ENHANCES THE GOVERNMENT\'S POWER 
TO SEIZE RESOURCES RELATING TO TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. 
 
A NEW REGULATION OF INVESTIGATORY POWERS ACT, WHICH BECAME 
LAW IN JULY 2000, ESTABLISHES ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERCEPTION 
OF COMMUNICATIONS AND A STATUTORY BASIS FOR THE AUTHORIZATION 
AND USE OF COVERT SURVEILLANCE.  THE ACT GIVES ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS NEEDED LEVERAGE IN DEALING WITH INDIVIDUALS OR 
GROUPS SUSPECTED OF BEING INVOLVED IN TERRORIST-RELATED 
ACTIVITIES WHILE SAFEGUARDING THE PUBLIC FROM UNNECESSARY 
INVASIONS OF THEIR PRIVACY.  BRITISH OFFICIALS HAVE INITIATED 
COOPERATIVE EFFORTS WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO ASSIST THEM 
IN BRINGING TO JUSTICE INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND TO DETER ACTS OF TERRORISM. 
 
HMG SIGNED THE UN CONVENTION ON TERRORIST BOMBING ON JANUARY 
10, 2000, THE FIRST DAY THE CONVENTION WAS OPENED FOR 
SIGNING.  IT IS COMMITTED TO RATIFYING THAT CONVENTION AND 
THE CONVENTION ON TERRORIST FINANCING, WHICH WAS SIGNED IN 
1998, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
 
F.  SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR 
TERRORIST GROUPS:  HMG DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY FORM OF TERRORISM 
OR ANY TERRORISTS.  IT ACTIVELY OPPOSES INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, TERRORISTS AND TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE GOVERNMENT 
IS COMMITTED TO PREVENTING THE UK BEING USED AS A BASE FOR 
TERRORISM, INCLUDING AS A SOURCE FOR FUNDING OF TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES ABROAD.  THE NEW TERRORISM ACT WILL ENHANCE HMG 
AUTHORITIES\' ABILITY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. 
 
G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRIES ON A TERRORIST ISSUE:  HMG HAS NOT MADE ANY 
STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF U.S.-DESIGNATED STATE SPONSORS OF 
TERRORISM ON TERRORISM-RELATED ISSUES.  IT CONSISTENTLY 
SPEAKS OUT PUBLICLY IN OPPOSITION TO TERRORISM AND USES ITS 
DIALOGUE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED AS 
SUPPORTING OR TOLERATING TERRORISM, TO DO THE SAME. 
 
H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE UK\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM 
DURING 2000:  THE UK REMAINS RESOLUTELY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM 
IN ALL FORMS. 
 
I.  U.S COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVESS PURSUED IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH HMG:  HMG COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. 
AT ALL LEVELS ON COUNTERTERRORISM POLICIES AND OPERATIONS, 
BOTH BILATERALLY AND THROUGH INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDING 
THE G8 AND THE UN.  THIS COOPERATION INCLUDES REGULAR 
BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS ON POLICY AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES. 
 
WASHINGTON\'S CLOSE TIES TO BOTH LONDON AND DUBLIN FACILITATED 
OUR CONTINUING KEY ROLE IN FACILITATING THE PEACE PROCESS IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND.  THE RESULT OF THE CLOSE COOPERATION HAS 
BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND 
CONTINUED PROGRESS TOWARD NORMALIZATION OF POLITICAL, 
POLICING AND SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS AS CALLED FOR IN THE GOOD 
FRIDAY AGREEMENT.  U.S. OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY 
WITH BRITISH AND IRISH COUNTERPARTS TO CONTAIN THE CONTINUED 
TERRORIST THREAT PRESENTED BY DISSIDENT REPUBLICAN AND 
LOYALIST PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  INCIDENTS OR ATTEMPTS DURING 
2000 INCLUDE INTRACOMMUNITY FEUDS AND PUNISHMENT ATTACKS ON 
CIVILIANS AS WELL AS ACTIONS AGAINST POLICE, SECURITY AND 
MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND PERSONNEL IN BOTH NORTHERN IRELAND 
AND GREAT BRITAIN.  THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED THE 
REAL IRA, THE CONTINUITY IRA, THE RED HAND DEFENDERS, AND THE 
ORANGE VOLUNTEERS ARE NOT MAINTAINING A TOTAL AND UNEQUIVOCAL 
CEASE-FIRE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT. 
 
IN DECEMBER, HMG JOINED THE U.S. IN VOTING IN THE UNSC FOR 
SANCTIONS TO BE IMPOSED ON THE TALIBAN.  IT HAS SUPPORTED THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF AN EU COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY AND ENCOURAGED 
USE OF THE G8 MECHANISM TO INCREASE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
IN COUNTERING TERRORISM. 
 
J.  COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. IN THE INVESTIGATION OR 
PROSECUTION OF ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. 
CITIZENS OR INTERESTS:  COOPERATION BETWEEN THE USG AND HMG 
HAS BEEN INVALUABLE TO THE UNITED STATES IN CONNECTION WITH 
ITS INVESTIGATION INTO USAMA BIN LADEN AND AL-QAEDA 
ORGANIZATION.  HMG CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE USG TO 
ENSURE THAT KHALID AL-FAWWAZ, ABDEL MOHAMMED ABDUL ALMADGID 
BARY, AND IBRAHIM EIDAROUS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN INDICTED IN 
THE U.S. ON TERRORISM-RELATED CHARGES, ARE EXTRADITED TO THE 
U.S.  U.S.-UK COOPERATION HAS BEEN CRUCIAL IN BRINGING TO 
TRIAL THE TWO LIBYANS CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE BOMBING 
OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103 IN 1988. 
 
K.  PREVENTION OF TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS IN THE 
UK:  THE USG AND HMG SHARE INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE TERRORIST 
THREATS AND SPONSOR REGULAR BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS, JOINT 
TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND EXERCISES WHICH FURTHER STRENGTHEN 
COOPERATIVE EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND RESPOND TO TERRORIST ACTS 
OR SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. 
 
2.  EMBASSY LONDON IS ALSO FORWARDING BY FAX SUGGESTED 
REVISIONS TO THE TEXT OF APPENDIX B OF \'PATTERNS OF GLOBAL 
TERRORISM - 1999\', WHICH PROVIDES BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON 
TERRORIST GROUPS, AND LANGUAGE PROVIDED BY HMG REGARDING 
WHETHER CERTAIN OF THOSE GROUPS IN NORTHERN IRELAND ARE 
CONSIDERED TO BE ON CEASEFIRE. 
 
3.  EMBASSY LONDON REQUESTS THAT WE BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO REVIEW THE FINAL DRAFT OF THE MAIN TEXT AND SECTIONS OF 
THE APPENDICES OF THE 2000 REPORT THAT DEAL WITH THE UK, 
INCLUDING NORTHERN IRELAND, PRIOR TO PUBLICATION OF THE 
REPORT.  WE WILL COORDINATE THIS REVIEW WITH CONSULATE 
GENERAL BELFAST TO ENSURE THAT ALL STATEMENTS AND 
DESCRIPTIONS ARE CURRENT AND ACCURATE AT THE TIME OF 
PUBLICATION.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, UK 
SUBJECT: UNITED KINGDOM: 2001 ANNUAL TERRRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 198912 
 
1.  POST HAS KEYED ITS RESPONSES TO REFTEL PARAGRAPHS. 
 
A) DESCRIBE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN TO SUPPORT THE 
ANTI-TERRORISM COALITION, PARTICULARLY IN ACTIONS TAKEN 
AGAINST AL-QAEDA AND THE TALIBAN. 
 
THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS AN EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG RECORD OF 
ACTIONS TO COUNTER THE TERRORIST THREAT POSED BY AL-QAEDA AND 
THE TALIBAN.  HER MAJESTY\'S GOVERNMENT RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY 
TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 BY WORKING WITH THE U.S. TO 
BUILD THE GLOBAL ANTI-TERRORISM COALITION.  IT JOINED THE 
U.S. IN VOTING IN THE UNSC IN DECEMBER 2000 FOR SANCTIONS TO 
BE IMPOSED ON THE TALIBAN.  THE UK ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORTED 
NATO\'S INVOKING OF ARTICLE 5, THE MUTUAL DEFENSE CLAUSE, OF 
THE NATO TREATY AS WELL AS UNSC RESOLUTION 1133.  PRIME 
MINISTER BLAIR USED EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS 
TO JOIN THE COALITION AND, BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 19 AND DECEMBER 
13, VISITED CLOSE TO 20 COUNTRIES, AND HOSTED NUMEROUS 
LEADERS IN LONDON, TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR THE WAR AGAINST 
TERRORISM. 
 
THE MINISTRIES AND DEPARTMENTS OF HMG HAVE GIVEN UNQUALIFIED 
SUPPORT TO ACTION TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAEDA AND THE TALIBAN. 
 
UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS RESPONDED 
IMMEDIATELY TO SEPTEMBER 11 TO ESTABLISH A CENTRAL POINT OF 
CONTACT TO ENSURE SEAMLESS COOPERATION BETWEEN NUMEROUS UK 
AND U.S. INVESTIGATORY EFFORTS IN CONNECTION WITH AL-QAEDA 
AND THE TALIBAN. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED BLANKET OVERFLIGHT CLEARANCE FOR U.S. 
AIRCRAFT AND PROVIDED CRITICAL AIR, NAVAL AND GROUND ASSETS 
AND FACILITIES IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.  IT 
HAS ALSO PLAYED THE LEADERSHIP ROLE IN ORGANIZING THE 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
THE UK TREASURY HAD BEGUN TO FREEZE TERRORISTS\' ASSETS PRIOR 
TO SEPTEMBER 11 AND RESPONDED QUICKLY AND POSITIVELY TO U.S. 
REQUESTS RELATED TO E.O. 13224 TO FREEZE TALIBAN AND AL-QAEDA 
FINANCES.   TO DATE, HMG HAS FROZEN $100 MILLION IN TERRORIST 
ASSETS. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT PASSED NEW ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION IN 
MID-DECEMBER THAT BOLSTERS BRITAIN\'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH 
TERRORIST THREATS AND NETWORKS. 
 
B) IF POSSIBLE, PROVIDE WELL DOCUMENTED AND UNCLASSIFIED CASE 
STUDIES OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS THWARTED, OR TERRORIST CELLS 
BROKEN UP DURING 2001. 
 
UK LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE IN EFFORTS TO 
DISRUPT TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  TEN INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN 
DETAINED BY UK LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE 
LINKS TO TERRORISM. 
 
ON JULY 3, UK LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARRESTED ABU DOHA, AN 
ALGERIAN, ON A PROVISIONAL ARREST WARRANT OBTAINED AS A 
RESULT OF DOHA\'S BEING INDICTED IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF 
NEW YORK, ON TERRORISM CHARGES RELATED TO HIS INVOLVEMENT IN 
THE DECEMBER 1999 PLOT TO COMMIT A TERRORIST ATTACK IN THE 
UNITED STATES.  DOHA IS KNOWN TO HAVE TIES TO USAMA BIN 
LADEN, AL-QAEDA AND ALGERIAN EXTREMISTS. 
 
ON SEPTEMBER 25, UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DETAINED THREE 
ALGERIANS, KAMEL DAOUDI, MOHAMED MEHDI MESLI, AND BAGHDAD 
MEZIANE, IN CONNECTION WITH A TERRORISM INVESTIGATION. 
DAOUDI WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DEPORTED TO FRANCE.  MESLI AND 
MEZIANE HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE UK WITH CRIMINAL OFFENSES 
UNDER THE UK  POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT (PACE). 
 
ON OCTOBER 29, UK LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS CHARGED YASSER 
AL-SIRRI WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER (UNDER THE PACE) 
AND INVITING SUPPORT FOR A PROSCRIBED ORGANIZATION (UNDER THE 
TERRORISM ACT OF 2000).  THE CHARGES STEM FROM AL-SIRRI\'S 
ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE ASSASSINATION OF AFGHAN NORTHERN 
ALLIANCE LEADER AHMAD SHAH MASSOUD ON SEPTEMBER 9. 
 
UK SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO 
INTERVENED TO THWART NUMEROUS TERRORIST ATTACKS BY REPUBLICAN 
AND LOYALIST DISSIDENT PARAMILITARY GROUPS IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND WHICH HAVE REFUSED TO JOIN THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE 
PROCESS AND CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN TERRORISM. THE 
GOVERNMENT MOVED DECISIVELY TO DISRUPT THE ACTIVITIES OF 
THESE GROUPS.  A FORMAL REQUEST FROM THE BRITISH AND IRISH 
GOVERNMENTS RESULTED IN THE U.S.G. DESIGNATING THE REAL IRA 
AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.  THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT 
\"SPECIFIED\" TWO LOYALIST PARAMILITARIES. 
 
C) DESCRIBE JUDICIAL SYSTEM REACTION TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
DURING 2001, INCLUDING ANY PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO 
TERRORISM, TO INCLUDE ACTIONS RELATED TO ACTS OF TERRORISM 
AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
A CLOSELY COORDINATED U.S.-UK EFFORT TO BRING TO JUSTICE TWO 
LIBYANS CHARGED WITH THE 1988 PAN AM 103 LOCKERBIE BOMBING 
RESULTED IN A TRIAL IN A SCOTTISH COURT SITTING IN THE 
NETHERLANDS.  THE TRIAL CONCLUDED WITH ONE OF THE DEFENDANTS 
FOUND GUILTY.  AN APPEAL IS IN PROGRESS. 
 
UK LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE AGAINST TWELVE INDIVIDUALS 
CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE HIJACKING TO THE UK OF AN 
AFGHAN ARIANA AIRLINER IN FEBRUARY 2000.  CHARGES INCLUDE 
HIJACKING, FALSE IMPRISONMENT, POSSESSION OF A FIREARM WITH 
INTENT TO CAUSE FEAR OF VIOLENCE, AND POSSESSION OF 
EXPLOSIVES. 
 
HMG CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATIONS OF TERRORIST MURDERS 
RELATING TO THE TROUBLES IN NORTHERN IRELAND.  KEY CASES 
INCLUDE THE 1998 BOMBING IN OMAGH, LINKED TO THE REAL IRA, 
WHICH KILLED 29 PERSONS; THE 1999 MURDER OF DEFENSE LAWYER 
ROSEMARY NELSON; AND THE MURDERS OF PAT FINUCANE AND ROBERT 
HAMILL.  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO APPEAL FOR 
WITNESSES TO COME FORWARD WITH EVIDENCE THAT COULD BE USED IN 
COURT TO PROSECUTE SUSPECTS. 
 
THE UK GOVERNMENT ALSO PRESSES OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO PROSECUTE 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  IT CONTINUES TO PURSUE THE CASES OF 
BRITISH AND AMERICAN CITIZENS MURDERED IN YEMEN IN 1998 AND 
THE MURDER OF BRITISH CITIZENS IN UGANDA IN 1999.  IT IS 
WORKING WITH GREEK OFFICIALS TO BRING TO JUSTICE THOSE 
AFFILIATED WITH NOVEMBER 17, THE ORGANIZATION THAT HAS 
CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE JUNE 2000 TERRORIST MURDER OF UK 
MILITARY ATTACHE BRIGADIER SAUNDERS.  BRITISH OFFICIALS ARE 
WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF YEMEN TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OCTOBER 2000 ATTACK ON THE BRITISH 
EMBASSY THERE, AS WELL AS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA 
RELATIVE TO THE ATTACKS AND MURDER OF BRITISH CITIZENS IN 
THAT COUNTRY. 
 
D) DID THE UK EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR?  HOW 
DID THE UK RESPOND TO U.S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR 
ASSISTANCE IN TERRORIST CASES? 
 
EXTRADITION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE UK IS GOVERNED BY A 
BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE ON 
JANUARY 21, 1977, AND BY THE SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY, WHICH 
ENTERED INTO FORCE ON DECEMBER 23, 1986. THE UK IS CURRENTLY 
ASSISTING IN U.S. EXTRADITION REQUESTS OF FOUR INDIVIDUALS 
CURRENTLY DETAINED IN THE UK AND CHARGED BY THE U.S. IN 
CONNECTION WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE U.S. OR AGAINST U.S. 
CITIZENS. 
 
KHALID AL FAWWAZ, ADEL MOHAMMED, ABOUL ALMAGID ABDUL BARY, 
AND IBRAHIM HUSSEIN ABDELHADI EIDAROUS ARE WANTED IN THE 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
BOMBING OF THE U.S. EMBASSIES IN EAST AFRICA.  ON DECEMBER 
17, THE HOUSE OF LORDS REJECTED THEIR APPEAL, BUT, UNDER UK 
LAW, THE DEFENDANTS HAVE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO APPEAL. 
ABU DOHA, AN ALGERIAN NATIONAL, WAS ARRESTED IN LONDON ON 
JULY 3, 2001 BASED ON A PROVISIONAL ARREST REQUEST SUBMITTED 
BY THE U.S. RELATING TO HIS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
MILLENNIUM BOMBING CASE.  HE IS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED 
AWAITING EXTRADITION. 
 
E) DESCRIBE, IF ANY, SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION 
AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
IT IS THE POLICY TO THE UK GOVERNMENT TO PROSECUTE AND/OR 
EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  THE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTS 
THIS POLICY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF UK LAW, THE EUROPEAN 
CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THE 1951 CONVENTION ON REFUGEES, 
AND UK ASYLUM LAWS.  SATISFYING THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS CAN BE 
TIME-CONSUMING.  ONE HURDLE IS THAT THE UK LAW REQUIRES PRIMA 
FACIE EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF AN EXTRADITION REQUEST.  THE 
1986 BILATERAL U.S.-UK SUPPLEMENTAL EXTRADITION TREATY 
IMPOSES ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON EXTRADITION FOR VIOLENT 
OFFENSES.  ARTICLE 3(A) PROVIDES THAT THE FUGITIVE MAY DEFEAT 
EXTRADITION IF HE PROVES TO THE COURT, BY A PREPONDERANCE OF 
THE EVIDENCE, THAT HIS EXTRADITION IS SOUGHT IN ORDER TO 
PUNISH HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS RACE, RELIGION, NATIONALITY OR 
POLITICAL OPINION, OR THAT IF SURRENDERED, HE WOULD BE 
PREJUDICED AT HIS TRIAL OR PUNISHED, DETAINED, OR RESTRICTED 
IN HIS PERSONAL LIBERTY ON ACCOUNT OF THOSE SAME REASONS. 
ARTICLE 3(B) ALSO AUTHORIZES APPEAL FROM THE COURT\'S FINDING, 
A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM GENERAL U.S. EXTRADITION 
PRACTICE AND A PROVISION THAT INCREASES THE TIME REQUIRED FOR 
SUCCESSFUL EXTRADITION. 
 
UK LAW DOES NOT ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE EXTRADITED IF 
THEY WOULD FACE THE DEATH PENALTY AS A RESULT OF THE ENSUING 
PROSECUTION.  THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WILLING TO 
EXTRADITE INDIVIDUALS IF IT RECEIVES ASSURANCES THAT THE 
DEATH PENALTY WOULD BE WAIVED IN THE PARTICULAR CASE. 
 
THE HOME SECRETARY HAS GIVEN PRIORITY TO REVISING THE UK\'S 
LAW GOVERNING EXTRADITION IN ORDER TO STREAMLINE THE 
EXTRADITION PROCESS.  IN ORDER FOR THE U.S. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OF THE NEW LEGISLATION, IT WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE A NEW 
BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE UK.  BILATERAL 
DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEGUN TOWARD THIS END. 
 
F) DISCUSS BRITISH RESPONSES, OTHER THAN PROSECUTION, TO 
INCLUDE PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL 
NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE 
THE COUNTRY) AND EFFORTS BY HOST GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE 
TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11 TERRORIST ATTACKS, HMG IMMEDIATELY 
LAUNCHED A SUSTAINED PUBLIC AFFAIRS EFFORT TO HIGHLIGHT THE 
GLOBAL NATURE OF THE THREAT POSED BY THE AL-QAEDA NETWORK, TO 
EMPHASIZE THE UK\'S CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE U.S., AND TO 
DEMONSTRATE THE UK\'S COMMITMENT TO THE COALITION EFFORT IN 
AFGHANISTAN.  NOTABLE PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY PRIME MINISTER 
BLAIR INCLUDED HIS OCTOBER 2 SPEECH TO THE LABOR PARTY 
CONFERENCE, HIS NOVEMBER 14 STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT, AND 
DURING HIS DECEMBER 11 JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH SECRETARY 
POWELL IN LONDON.  FOREIGN SECRETARY STRAW, HOME SECRETARY 
BLUNKETT AND OTHER SENIOR BRITISH OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO MADE 
FREQUENT SUPPORTIVE STATEMENTS. 
 
HMG ALSO MOVED QUICKLY TO ESTABLISH WITH THE U.S. JOINT 
COALITION INFORMATION CENTERS (CICS) IN LONDON, WASHINGTON 
AND ISLAMABAD AS PART OF A COORDINATED EFFORT TO BUILD 
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST AL-QAEDA AND 
THE LARGER WAR AGAINST TERRORISM.  U.S., BRITISH, AND OTHER 
COALITION OFFICIALS WORK TOGETHER IN THE CENTERS. 
 
THE UK ACTIVELY CAMPAIGNS IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDING 
THE EU, G8 AND UN, FOR COORDINATED GLOBAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT 
THE TERRORIST THREAT. 
 
THE UK PRESSES GOVERNMENTS TO RESPOND AGGRESSIVELY TO 
TERRORIST INCIDENTS AND THREATS.  HMG CONSULTS WITH AND 
PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE PREPARED TO 
DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES TO FIGHT TERRORISM. 
 
G) DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 
2001 BY THE UK, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
CONSISTENT WITH THE UK\'S TERRORISM BILL OF 2000, WHICH 
WIDENED THE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM TO INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL 
AS WELL AS DOMESTIC ACTIONS, THE GOVERNMENT ADDED 22 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS TO ITS LIST OF 
\"PROSCRIBED\" ORGANIZATIONS IN FEBRUARY 2001.  THE LIST 
INCLUDES AL-QAEDA.  IT IS A CRIME TO BE A MEMBER OF OR TO 
SUPPORT AN ORGANIZATION ON THE PROSCRIBED LIST. 
 
PARTLY IN RESPONSE TO EVIDENCE THAT SOME OF THE TERRORISTS 
CONNECTED TO THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS HAD LIVED IN OR HAD 
CONNECTIONS TO THE UK, HMG INTRODUCED NEW LEGISLATION IN 
ORDER TO EXPAND FURTHER ITS AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH TERRORIST 
THREATS, AND ON DECEMBER 14 THE ANTI-TERRORISM, CRIME AND 
SECURITY BILL BECAME LAW. 
 
THE LAW GAVE THE GOVERNMENT THE POWER TO DETAIN INDEFINITELY 
WITHOUT TRIAL FOREIGN NATIONALS SUSPECTED OF TERRORISM WHO 
CANNOT BE DEPORTED BECAUSE OF RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE 
HUMAN RIGHTS ACT.  IT GIVES POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES, 
INCLUDING FOREIGN AGENCIES, THE POWER TO ASK PUBLIC BODIES, 
INCLUDING HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS AND TAX AUTHORITIES, TO DISCLOSE 
INFORMATION RELATING TO TERRORISM.  IT ALLOWS FOR ASSETS OF 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS TO BE FROZEN AT THE START OF AN 
INVESTIGATION RATHER THAN AFTER A SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION.  IT 
CRIMINALIZES THE AIDING OR ABETTING THE OVERSEAS USE OR 
DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL, NUCLEAR OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.  AND 
IT REQUIRES TRANSPORT CARRIERS TO SUPPLY INFORMATION ABOUT 
PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND 
REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO REPORT CASES WHERE THEY 
THINK THERE ARE REASONABLE GROUNDS TO SUSPECT TERRORIST 
FINANCING.  THE ACT ALSO GIVES BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE AND 
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE POLICE EXPANDED POWERS AND AUTHORITY TO 
DEAL WITH MATTERS CONNECTED TO TERRORISM OUTSIDE THEIR FORMER 
JURISDICTION. 
 
THE UK HAS ENCOURAGED COORDINATION WITHIN THE EU ON 
COUNTER-TERRORISM INITIATIVES.  THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS EU 
ADOPTION OF A LEGAL FRAMEWORK BY WHICH ALL MEMBER STATES ARE 
ABLE TO FREEZE THE ASSETS OF TERRORIST STATES, INDIVIDUALS 
AND ENTITIES AND WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR AN AGREED LIST OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  THE NEW UK TERRORISM 
LEGISLATION PROVIDES THAT THE ANTICIPATED EU JUDICIAL AND 
POLICE LAW WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO UK LAW ON AN EXPEDITED 
BASIS. 
 
THE BRITISH JOINED THE IRISH GOVERNMENT IN REQUESTING THAT 
THE U.S. ADD THE REAL IRA, WHICH HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR A 
NUMBER OF TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE UK OVER THE PAST SEVERAL 
YEARS AND WHICH IS LINKED TO THE 1998 OMAGH BOMBING WHICH 
KILLED 29 PEOPLE, TO THE U.S. LIST OF FOREIGN TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
H) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT UK SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS. 
HMG HAS NOT PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, 
TERRORISTS, OR TERRORIST GROUPS.  HMG CONSISTENTLY AND 
STRONGLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF OR SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. 
 
I) HAS HMG MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  (THE 
SEVEN GOVERNMENTS DESIGNATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE AS 
SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ARE CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, NORTH 
KOREA, SYRIA, AND SUDAN.) 
 
HMG HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORIST ISSUE, AND 
CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF OR SUPPORT FOR 
TERRORISM. 
 
J) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 2001, POSITIVE OR 
NEGATIVE, IN THE UK\'S  ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC.  WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS 
CHANGE? 
 
THE UK HAS MAINTAINED ITS CONSISTENTLY STRONG STAND AGAINST 
ALL FORMS OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM THROUGHOUT 
2001.  THE TERRORISM BILL OF 2000, WHICH WIDENED THE 
DEFINITION OF TERRORISM TO INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS 
DOMESTIC ACTIONS, SENSITIZED BRITISH ATTITUDES TO THE 
VULNERABILITY OF BRITAIN TO THE INTERNATIONAL THREAT. 
POST-SEPTEMBER 11, THE UK HAS FURTHER STIFFENED ITS RESOLVE 
AND PASSED NEW LEGISLATION TO COMBAT TERRORISM. 
 
K) DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES 
WITH THE UK, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REQUESTS TO THE 
UK FOR SPECIFIC COOPERATION AND EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES 
IN THE UK TO ELIMINATE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO 
TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES. 
DESCRIBE THE EXTENT OF THE UK\'S COOPERATION WITH THOSE 
EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UK 
HAS SATISFIED THE SPECIFIC REQUESTS. 
 
HMG COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. AT ALL LEVELS ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY AND OPERATIONS, BOTH BILATERALLY AND 
THROUGH INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDING THE G8 AND THE UN. 
THIS COOPERATION INCLUDES REGULAR INTENSIVE BILATERAL 
CONSULTATIONS ON POLICY AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES. 
 
THIS COOPERATION EXTENDS TO THE CAMPAIGN TO FREEZE THE ASSETS 
OF AL-QAEDA-RELATED AND OTHER TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  THE 
TERRORISM ACT OF 2000 MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO RAISE FUNDS OR 
PROVIDE MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS PROSCRIBED AS INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC 
TERRORIST ENTITIES.  IN ADDITION, HMG ACTED QUICKLY TO FREEZE 
ASSETS OF ALL BUT TWO OF THE TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS/INDIVIDUALS ON THE LISTS DEVELOPED BY THE 
UNITED STATES AT THE SAME TIME THE U.S. TOOK ACTION.  IT HAS 
REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON TWO GROUPS ON A 
PARTICULAR LIST IN ORDER TO ENSURE THERE IS A BASIS FOR HMG 
FREEZING THEIR ASSETS. 
 
L) PROVIDE INFORMATION ON: 
 
--(I) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UK IN 2001 COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN 
APPREHENDING, CONVICTING, AND PUNISHING THE INDIVIDUAL OR 
INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. 
 
UK AGENCIES PROVIDE U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH INVALUABLE 
SUPPORT IN ITS EFFORTS TO LOCATE AND APPREHEND INDIVIDUALS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST OR WHO REPRESENT 
THREATS TO U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.  THIS SUPPORT INCLUDES 
THE PROVISIONAL ARREST OF INDIVIDUALS CHARGED WITH CRIMES 
UNDER U.S. LAW AND THE WILLINGNESS TO DEPORT INDIVIDUALS FOR 
PROSECUTION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 
--(II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UK IN 2001 COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING IN PREVENTING FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST 
UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN BRITISH TERRITORY. 
 
THE USG AND HMG SHARE INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE TERRORIST 
THREATS AND EVIDENCE RELATING TO INCIDENTS.  THERE ARE ALSO 
REGULAR BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS, JOINT TRAINING PROGRAMS AND 
EXERCISES WHICH FURTHER STRENGTHEN JOINT READINESS. 
 
BRITISH OFFICIALS RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS TO INCREASE SECURITY FOR U.S. DIPLOMATIC 
AND MILITARY FACILITIES IN THE UK.  THE LONDON METROPOLITAN 
POLICE HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE EMBASSY\'S REGIONAL 
SECURITY OFFICER (RSO) TO ENHANCE SECURITY FOR BOTH OFFICIAL 
AND UNOFFICIAL AMERICANS.  EXTENSIVE SECURITY UPGRADES 
(ANTI-RAM BARRIERS, FENCING, INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE) TO 
THE EMBASSY AND CONSULATES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITH THE 
STRONG SUPPORT OF THE POLICE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH 
OFFICE, AND CITY COUNCILS.  THE UK NATIONAL TERRORIST CRIME 
PREVENTION UNIT HAS CONDUCTED NUMEROUS SECURITY BRIEFINGS FOR 
U.S. COMPANIES OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE UK. 
 
THE UK DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE 
REGIONS RESPONDED TO SEPTEMBER 11 BY IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENTING 
ROBUST, HEIGHTENED SECURITY MEASURES AT ALL UK AIRPORTS AND 
TRANSPORT FACILITIES. IT ALSO ACTED QUICKLY TO MEET ALL FAA 
REQUESTS FOR EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES ON U.S. AND FOREIGN 
CARRIER FLIGHTS DEPARTING FOR THE U.S. 
 
M) IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION 
DURING THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, 
DESCRIBE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UK IN 2001 COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING IN PREVENTING ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST UNITED 
STATED CITIZENS IN BRITISH TERRITORY. 
 
UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SECURITY SERVICES WORK CLOSELY WITH 
U.S. OFFICIALS TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT PROACTIVE STEPS TO 
PREVENT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  WHEN INVESTIGATIONS BY U.S. 
AUTHORITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED LINKS BETWEEN 
INDIVIDUALS/ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UK AND INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED, 
WANTED, OR SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORIST ATTACKS 
AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS OR CITIZENS, THE UK GOVERNMENT HAS 
COOPERATED FULLY.  THIS EFFORT INCLUDED INDIVIDUALS WITH 
CONNECTIONS TO THE BOMBINGS OF THE U.S. EMBASSIES IN KENYA 
AND TANZANIA, THE DECEMBER 1999 PLOT TO COMMIT A TERRORIST 
ATTACK AGAINST LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, THE ATTACK 
ON THE USS COLE, AND THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS ON NEW YORK AND 
WASHINGTON DC.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EI, PGOV, PINR, PREL, PTER, UK 
SUBJECT: UNITED KINGDOM: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 201772 
 
1. (U) THIS TELEGRAM CONTAINS EMBASSY LONDON\'S CONTRIBUTIONS 
TO THE 2002 \"PATTERNS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM\" REPORT.  EMBASSY 
INPUT IS KEYED TO REFTEL QUESTIONS. 
 
2. (U) SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE UK TO SUPPORT THE 
GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST AL-QAIDA OPERATIVES, BUT 
INCLUDING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO BLOCK TERRORIST ASSETS, ENACT 
NEW COUNTER TERRORISM LAWS, RATIFY EXISTING TREATIES. 
 
A) THE UK REMAINS ONE OF THE UNITED STATES\' STRONGEST ALLIES 
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND HAS MADE THE ELIMINATION 
OF TERRORISM AS A FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS A PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY.  THE U.S. AND THE UK 
COOPERATE CLOSELY AND EFFECTIVELY BILATERALLY AND IN 
MULTILATERAL FORA, SUCH AS THE G-8 AND THE UNITED NATIONS, TO 
COUNTER TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  COUNTER TERRORISM IS A FOCUS 
OF THE UK\'S BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. 
THE UK\'S INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY AGENCIES HAVE 
SIGNIFICANTLY DEEPENED THEIR WORK AGAINST TERRORISM WITH 
THEIR FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS, ESPECIALLY THE U.S. 
 
-- THE UK WAS INVOLVED FROM THE OUTSET ALONGSIDE THE U.S. IN 
THE EFFORT TO EXPEL AL-QAIDA FROM ITS BASES IN AFGHANISTAN, 
KILL AND CAPTURE ITS OPERATIVES, AND OVERTHROW THE TALIBAN 
REGIME.  THE UK LED THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
FORCE (ISAF), WHICH BECAME OPERATIONAL IN FEBRUARY 2002, 
UNTIL TURKEY ASSUMED COMMAND OF ISAF.  IN MARCH 2002, THE UK 
DEPLOYED A 1,700-STRONG FORCE, KNOWN AS TASK FORCE JACANA, TO 
EASTERN AFGHANISTAN FOR FOUR MONTHS.  JACANA WORKED ALONGSIDE 
U.S. FORCES IN THE REGION TO COMBAT AL-QAIDA.  IN 2002, 
BRITISH MILITARY FORCES ALSO PARTICIPATED IN COALITION 
OPERATIONS AIMED AT DENYING AL-QAIDA TERRORISTS AN 
ALTERNATIVE BASE OUTSIDE AFGHANISTAN.  THIS INCLUDED MARITIME 
PATROLS IN THE ARABIAN SEA. 
 
-- THE ANTI-TERRORISM, CRIME AND SECURITY ACT (2001) PROVIDES 
HMG THE POWER TO DETAIN INDEFINITELY IMMIGRANTS AND ASYLUM 
SEEKERS SUSPECTED OF BEING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS, BUT WHO 
CANNOT BE REMOVED FROM THE UK IMMEDIATELY.  SINCE THE ACT 
CAME INTO FORCE IN DECEMBER 2001, TWELVE FOREIGN NATIONALS 
HAVE BEEN DETAINED USING ITS POWERS.  OF THE TOTAL DETAINED, 
TWO HAVE VOLUNTARILY LEFT THE UK.  THE OTHER 10 REMAIN IN 
DETENTION. 
 
-- THE PREDECING TERRORISM ACT OF 2000 PROVIDES THE HOME 
SECRETARY WITH THE POWER TO PROSCRIBE FOREIGN TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS AND CREATES A NUMBER OF OFFENSES THAT RELATED 
TO PROSCRIPTION.  THE ACT INITIALLY PROSCRIBED AL-QAIDA AND 
20 OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS.  IN OCTOBER, THE UK PROSCRIBED 
FOUR ADDITIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS WITH LINKS TO 
AL-QAIDA, INCLUDING JEEMAH ISLAMIYAH, THE ABU SAYYAF GROUP, 
THE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OF UZBEKISTAN, AND ASBAT AL-ANSAR. 
 
-- AS OF OCTOBER 2002, THE UK HAD FROZEN THE ASSETS OF OVER 
100 ORGANIZATIONS AND OVER 200 INDIVIDUALS, BOTH IN RESPONSE 
TO SPECIFIC UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS (UNSCRS) AND 
UNDER UK DOMESTIC MEASURES.    IN RESPONSE TO UNSCRS BOTH 
BEFORE AND AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, PARTICULARLY AGAINST 
AL-QAIDA AND THE TALIBAN, THE UK FROZE A TOTAL OF $100 
MILLION IN TERRORIST ASSETS.  MOST OF THESE FUNDS HAVE NOW 
BEEN UNFROZEN AS A RESULT OF AFGHANISTAN\'S LIBERATION, AND 
HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THE LEGITIMATE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
-- THE UK IMPLEMENTED UNSCR 1333 ON DECEMBER 19, 2000; UNSCR 
1373 WAS IMPLEMENTED SEPTEMBER 18, 2001; AND UNSCR 1390 WAS 
IMPLEMENTED JANUARY 28, 2002.  BANKS WERE IMMEDIATELY 
INSTRUCTED TO FREEZE THE ASSETS OF ANY NAMES ATTACHED TO THE 
UNSCRS. THE UK IMPLEMENTED THE UN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION 
FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST FINANCING ON 10 APRIL 2002. 
 
-- THE ANTI-TERRORISM CRIME AND SECURITY ACT (2001) CONTAINS 
SEVERAL PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO HELP THE POLICE AND THE COURTS 
DEPRIVE TERRORISTS OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  THE ACT ALLOWS 
POLICE TO SEIZE ANYWHERE IN THE UK FUNDS THAT ARE INTENDED 
FOR USE IN TERRORIST ACTS, ARE RESOURCES OF PROSCRIBED 
ORGANIZATIONS, OR ARE OBTAINED THROUGH TERRORISM.  THE ACT 
ALSO EXPANDS POLICE POWERS TO MONITOR AND FREEZE TERRORIST 
ACCOUNTS, AND REQUIRES BANKS AND OTHERS TO REPORT TO THE 
POLICE ANY MONEY OR PROPERTY SUSPECTED OF BELONGING OR 
DERIVED FROM TERRORIST FUNDS.  FAILURE TO COMPLY MAY RESULT 
IN IMPRISONMENT FOR UP TO 5 YEARS, AND/OR UNLIMITED FINES. 
THE ACT ALSO MAKES IT AN OFFENSE TO LAUNDER TERRORIST FUNDS, 
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FUNDS ARE OR ARE INTENDED TO BE 
USED FOR THE HIRE OF ACTS OF TERRORISM.   IT ALSO STRENGTHENS 
PROVISIONS CONTAINED UNDER THE TERRORISM ACT OF 2000, WHICH 
PROHIBITS UK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FROM DISCLOSING ANY 
INFORMATION THAT IS LIKELY TO PREJUDICE A POLICE 
INVESTIGATION OR TO DISPOSE OF ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION.  THE 
ANTI-TERRORISM CRIME AND SECURITY ACT 2001 MAY BE SEEN IN 
FULL AT: WWW.HMSO.GOV.UK 
 
-- THE UK HAS INTRODUCED A NEW DOMESTIC REGULATORY REGIME TO 
ENSURE THAT BUREAUX DE CHANGE AND MONEY TRANSMITTERS 
IMPLEMENT MONEY-LAUNDERING REGULATIONS EFFECTIVELY.  THE 
PROCEEDS OF CRIME BILL INTRODUCED IN OCTOBER 2001 REQUIRES 
BUSINESSES IN THESE SECTORS TO FILE A SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTION 
REPORT (STR) WHEN IT IS SUSPECTED THAT A PERSON HERE OR 
ANOTHER PERSON IS LAUNDERING THE PROCEEDS OF ANY CRIME. 
UNDER THE MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS 2001, ALL MONEY 
SERVICE OPERATORS, INCLUDING BUREAUX DE CHANGE AND OPERATORS 
OF ALTERNATIVE REMITTANCE SYSTEMS, ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER 
THEIR OPERATION WITH CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES, WHICH HAVE THE 
POWER TO INSPECT THEIR OPERATIONS AT ANY TIME.  A COPY OF 
THESE REGULATIONS CAN BE FOUND AT WWW.HMSO.GOV.UK.  THE 
PROCEEDS OF CRIME BILL 2001 REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
AND CASH DEALERS TO VERIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS\' IDENTITY AND 
ADDRESS. 
 
-- THE UK IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT ENTITIES, IN 
PARTICULAR NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, CANNOT BE MISUSED TO 
FINANCE TERRORISM.  THE CHARITY COMMISSION, MANDATED TO 
REGULATE VIRTUALLY ALL CHARITIES IN ENGLAND AND WALES, IS 
EMPOWERED TO INITIATE INVESTIGATIONS OF CHARITIES SUSPECTED 
OF SUPPORTING TERRORISM.  SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE 
COMMISSION HAS CLOSED DOWN TWO CHARITIES FOR SUSPECTED 
SUPPORT OF TERRORISM, AND ANOTHER HAS HAD ITS ASSETS FROZEN. 
 
-- IN NOVEMBER 2001, A MULTI-AGENCY TERRORIST FINANCE TEAM 
(TFT) WAS SET UP IN THE NATIONAL CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICE TO ASSIST THE UK GOVERNMENT IN CUTTING OFF TERRORIST 
FUNDS.  THE TEAM COMBINES COUNTER TERRORIST AND FINANCIAL 
INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS EXPERTISE.  THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE 
TFT IS TO EXAMINE STRS FOR POSSIBLE TERRORIST CONNECTIONS. 
ADDITIONALLY, THE TFT\'S POSITION WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION 
WILL ENABLE IT TO IDENTIFY LINKS BETWEEN TERRORIST AND OTHER 
FINANCING.  SINCE ITS FOUNDING, OVER 3,500 DISCLOSURES HAVE 
BEEN REFERRED TO THE TFT. 
 
-- THE UK\'S FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER 
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, HAVE HELD TWO SEMINARS PROVIDING THE 
UK\'S FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR WITH UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION 
AND ADVICE ON STOPPING TERRORIST FINANCING. 
 
-- THE UK DID NOT ENACT MAJOR NEW COUNTER TERRORISM 
LEGISLATION IN 2002.  THE UK HAS RATIFIED ALL 12 UN COUNTER 
TERRORISM CONVENTIONS. 
 
3. (U) DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THE UK 
TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 2002, INCLUDING ANY HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM. 
 
B) UK LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE IN EFFORT 
TO DISRUPT AND/OR PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN TERRORIST 
ACTIVITY. 
 
-- THE INVESTIGATION INTO AND PROSECUTION OF SEVERAL 
ALGERIANS DETAINED ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2001 CONTINUES.  MOHAMED 
MEHDI MESLI AND BAGHDAD MEZIANE HAVE BEEN CHARGED UNDER THE 
PROVISIONS OF THE TERRORISM ACT OF 2000 AND WITH CRIMINAL 
OFFENSES UNDER THE UK POLICE AND CRIMINAL EVIDENCE ACT 
(PACE).  UK AUTHORITIES HAVE DETAINED SEVERAL OTHER 
INDIVIDUALS UNDER UK IMMIGRATION LAW IN CONNECTIONS WITH THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
 
-- IN AUGUST 2002, UK AUTHORITIES PROSECUTED FRANK ETIM, AKA 
SULAYMAN ZAIN-UL-ABIDIN, AKA FRANCIS ASIBONG VINCENT ETIM, 
FOR OFFENSES COMMITTED UNDER THE TERRORISM ACT OF 2000, 
SPECIFICALLY FOR PROVIDING INSTRUCTION OR TRAINING IN THE 
MAKING OR USE OF (A) FIREARMS, (B) EXPLOSIVES, OR (C) 
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL OR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOR INVITING 
ANOTHER TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION OR TRAINING.  ETIM WAS 
ACQUITTED, BUT THE PROSECUTION IS AN EXAMPLE OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO TARGET UK-BASED EXTREMISTS BELIEVED TO 
BE INVOLVED IN PROVIDING MATERIAL SUPPORT TO TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
-- UK AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY PREPARING TO PROSECUTE 
ABDULLAH IBRAHIM EL-FAISAL, AKA TREVOR WILLIAM FORREST, AKA 
FAISAL ABDALLAH AL-JAMAIKEE FOR OFFENCES OF 1) INCITEMENT TO 
MURDER AND 2) DISTRIBUTION OF RACIALLY INFLAMMATORY MATERIAL, 
LIKELY TO PROVOKE RACIAL HATRED. 
 
-- UK LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE USING THE \"NO FLY LIST\" TO 
DETAIN AND INTERVIEW INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY POSE A THREAT TO 
U.S. INTERESTS. 
 
-- UK SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES DISRUPTED 
NUMEROUS TERRORIST ATTACKS BY DISSIDENT IRISH REPUBLICAN AS 
WELL AS ENGAGED IN VIOLENT STREET CLASHES WITH LOYALIST 
PARAMILITARY GROUPS.  UK AUTHORITIES ARE PREPARING FOR THE 
TRIAL OF REPUBLICAN DISSIDENTS INVOLVED IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
DETONATE A CAR BOMB IN THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM. 
 
-- HMG CONTINUES ITS INVESTIGATION OF THE 1998 BOMBING IN 
OMAGH, WHICH IS LINKED TO THE REAL IRA AND KILLED 29 PEOPLE. 
 
4. (U) DID THE UK EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR? 
 
C) A BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY, WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE 
ON JANUARY 21, 1977, AND A SUPPLEMENTARY TREATY, WHICH 
ENTERED INTO FORCE ON DECEMBER 23, 1986, GOVERN EXTRADITION 
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE UK.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO EXTRADITIONS 
IN THE PAST YEAR TO THE U.S. 
 
-- THE UK CONTINUES TO ASSIST WITH THE U.S. REQUEST FOR THE 
EXTRADITION OF KHALED AL-FAWWAZ, ABDEL MOHAMMED ABDEL ABDUL 
BARY, AND IBRAHIM EIDAROUS TO THE U.S. FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT 
IN THE BOMBING OF THE U.S. EMBASSIES IN EAST AFRICA.  IN 
DECEMBER 2001, THE HOUSE OF LORDS REJECTED THEIR APPEAL TO 
BLOCK THE EXTRADITION, BUT THE THREE MEN HAVE APPEALED THIS 
RULING TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. 
 
-- THE UK COURTS DENIED THE U.S. REQUEST TO EXTRADITE LATFI 
RAISSI, WHO ALLEGEDLY HELPED TRAIN THE SEPTEMBER 11 
HIJACKERS, BECAUSE THEY DETERMINED THAT THE U.S. HAD NOT 
PRESENTED ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO APPROVE THE REQUEST. 
 
5. (U) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO UK GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
D) IT IS UK POLICY TO PROSECUTE AND/OR EXTRADITE SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF UK LAW, THE EUROPEAN 
CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THE 1951 CONVENTION ON REFUGEES, 
AND UK ASYLUM LAWS.  UK LAW REQUIRES PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE IN 
SUPPORT OF AN EXTRADITION REQUEST, AND DOES NOT ALLOW 
EXTRADITION TO OCCUR WHERE THE REQUEST IS BELIEVED TO BE MADE 
FOR THE PURPOSE OF PUNISHING A PERSON ON ACCOUNT OF HIS/HER 
RACE, RELIGION OR POLITICAL OPINION.  UK LAW DOES NOT ALLOW 
THE EXTRADITION OF INDIVIDUALS IF THEY WOULD FACE THE DEATH 
PENALTY.  THE UK HAS BEEN WILLING TO EXTRADITE INDIVIDUALS IF 
IT RECEIVES ASSURANCES THAT THE DEATH PENALTY WOULD BE 
WAIVED. 
 
-- SATISFYING THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EXTRADITION CAN BE 
TIME-CONSUMING (UP TO SIX YEARS IN SOME INSTANCES).  IN 
NOVEMBER 2002, THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO 
STREAMLINE AND SHORTEN THE UK EXTRADITION PROCESS.  IF 
ADOPTED IT WOULD ELIMINATE DUPLICATION OF HEARINGS AND 
APPEALS THAT ARE PART OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM.  THE PROPOSED 
LEGISLATION ALSO SIMPLIFIES THE RULES ON AUTHENTICATING 
FOREIGN DOCUMENTS SO THAT FAXED DOCUMENTS WOULD BE ACCEPTED 
AS VALID. 
 
6. (U) DISCUSS UK RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION.  THESE 
WOULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A 
TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE UK) AND EFFORTS BY THE 
UK TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
E) SINCE 9/11, THE UK HAS ENGAGED IN A SUSTAINED GLOBAL 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN TO HIGHLIGHT THE GLOBAL NATURE OF 
THE THREAT POSED BY THE AL-QAIDA NETWORK AND TO URGE OTHER 
COUNTRIES TO RESPOND VIGOROUSLY TO TERRORIST INCIDENTS AND 
THREATS. 
 
-- THE UK ASSISTS WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
INVESTIGATIONS.  A TEAM FROM THE METROPOLITAN POLICE HAS BEEN 
IN ATHENS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEIR GREEK COUNTERPARTS TO 
INVESTIGATE THE JUNE 2000 ASSASSINATION OF BRITISH MILITARY 
ATTACH BRIGADIER STEPHEN SAUNDERS AND IN THE WIDER HUNT FOR 
MEMBERS OF THE 17 NOVEMBER TERRORIST GROUP.  UK INVESTIGATORS 
ARE ALSO WORKING SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH INDONESIAN, AMERICAN AND 
AUSTRALIAN COUNTERPARTS TO INVESTIGATE THE OCTOBER 12 BOMBING 
OF THE SARI NIGHTCLUB IN BALI. 
 
7. (U) DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTER TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 
2002 BY THE UK, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL FORA. 
 
F) THE UK SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE COUNTER TERRORISM 
ASSISTANCE IT PROVIDES TO OTHER COUNTRIES.  THIS INCLUDES 
OPERATIONAL COUNTER TERRORISM TRAINING, SUCH AS BOMB 
DISPOSAL, HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION AND POLICE INVESTIGATIVE 
SKILLS, AND CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO HELP 
COUNTRIES DRAW UP THEIR OWN COUNTER TERRORISM LEGAL 
FRAMEWORKS.  MAJOR UK ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ARE UNDERWAY IN 
SOUTH AND SOUTH EAST ASIA, INCLUDING INDIA, THE PHILIPPINES, 
AND INDONESIA. 
 
-- THE UK ALSO PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES\' LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES FOR TERRORIST 
FINANCING INVESTIGATIONS.  THE UK CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE 
PROVISION OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING IN A 
NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES, AND IS FUNDING PROGRAMS DESIGNED 
TO ADDRESS A RANGE OF ANTI-TERRORIST FINANCING. 
 
-- THE UK ACTIVELY CAMPAIGNED IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, 
INCLUDING THE EU, NATO, G-8, AND UNITED NATIONS, FOR 
COORDINATED GLOBAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT TERRORISM AND ROUTINELY 
LOBBIED UN MEMBER STATES TO RATIFY THE TWELVE INTERNATIONAL 
CONVENTIONS AND PROTOCOL RELATING TO TERRORISM.  THE UK 
CHAIRS THE UN\'S COUNTER TERRORISM COMMITTEE (CTC), WHICH 
MONITORS THE COMPLIANCE OF MEMBER STATES WITH SECURITY 
COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1373. 
 
-- TO SUPPORT GLOBAL EFFORTS TO DENY TERRORIST GROUPS ACCESS 
TO WEAPONS AND MATERIALS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, THE UK 
COMMITTED TO CONTRIBUTING $750 OVER 10 YEARS TO THE G-8 
INITIATIVE TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION, WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED 
AT THE G-8 SUMMIT IN JUNE 2002. 
 
8. (U) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT UK SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
G) HMG DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, 
TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS.  HMG CONSISTENTLY AND 
STRONGLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF AND SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. 
 
9. (U) HAS THE UK MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE? 
 
H) HMG HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE AND 
CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY CONDEMNS ALL ACTS OF AND SUPPORT 
FOR TERRORISM. 
 
10. (U) DESCRIBE U.S. COUNTER TERRORISM EFFORTS AND 
INITIATIVES WITH THE UK, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
REQUESTS TO THE UK FOR SPECIFIC COOPERATION AND EFFORTS BY 
THE U.S. IN THE UK TO ELIMINATE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT TO TERRORIST GROUPS DIRECTLY OR IN SUPPORT OF THEIR 
ACTIVITIES. 
 
J) THE UK GOVERNMENT HAS, SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE U.S., OR 
SOON AFTER, FROZEN THE ASSETS OF VIRTUALLY EVERY ORGANIZATION 
AND INDIVIDUAL ON THE NOVEMBER 2001 U.S. EXECUTIVE ORDER AND 
SUBSEQUENT ANNEXES.  A NOTABLE EXCEPTION HAVE BEEN A FEW 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE UK ARGUES ARE \"POLITICAL\" AS OPPOSED 
TO \"ARMED\" BRANCHES OF ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS HAMAS AND 
HIZBOLLAH.  THE UK HAS FROZEN THE ASSETS OF THE \"ARMED\" WINGS 
OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS, HOWEVER.  THE UK FROZE THE ASSETS OF 
THE INTERNATIONAL SIKH YOUTH FEDERATION AND BABBAR KHALSA ON 
NOV. 2, 2001, BEFORE THE UNITED STATES DID SO ON JUNE 28, 
2002.  IN SEPTEMBER 2002, THE UK\'S HOME OFFICE CO-SPONSORED 
WITH THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT A SEMINAR IN LONDON FOR 
THIRD-COUNTRY ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS REGARDING IDENTIFICATION 
OF TERRORIST ASSETS. 
 
11. (U) IF THE USG HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION FROM THE UK DURING 
THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION 
OF AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR 
INTERESTS, PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON:

-- THE ASSISTANCE PROVIDED INCLUDES LOCATING/IDENTIFYING AND 
DETAINING OF INDIVIDUALS OF INTEREST TO THE U.S., CONDUCTING 
OF SEARCHES, OBTAINING OF PROVISION ARREST WARRANTS, AND 
DEPORTING INDIVIDUALS TO THE U.S. 
 
-- THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UK IN 2002 COOPERATED OR IS 
COOPERATING IN PREVENTING FURTHER ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST 
UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN THE UK. 
 
K2) THE U.S. AND THE UK REGULARLY SHARE INFORMATION ON 
POSSIBLE TERRORIST THREATS.  THE UK MAKES FULL USE OF ITS LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY UNDER THE TERRORISM ACT OF 2000 AND THE 
ANTI-TERRORISM, CRIME AND SECURITY ACT (2001) TO DISRUPT 
AND/OR PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS SUSPECTED OF BEING INVOLVED IN 
THE PLANNING OR COMMISSION OF A TERRORIST ACT. 
 
12. (U) IF THE U.S. HAS SOUGHT COOPERATION DURING THE 
PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS,

PREVENT AND DISRUPT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  WHEN 
INVESTIGATIONS BY U.S. AUTHORITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED LINKS 
BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS/ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UK AND INDIVIDUALS 
ARRESTED, WANTED, OR SUSPECTED OF INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORIST 
ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS, THE UK HAS 
COOPERATED FULLY.

TAGS: PTER, PINR, PREL, PGOV, UK 
SUBJECT: UNITED KINGDOM - 2003 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 301352 
 
1. (U) This telegram contains Embassy London\'s contributions 
to the 2003 \"Patterns of Global Terrorism\" Report.  Embassy 
input is keyed to reftel questions. 
 
2. (U) A) SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN BY HOST GOVERNMENTS TO 
SUPPORT THE GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM, PARTICULARLY 
LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST AL QAIDA OPERATIVES, 
BUT INCLUDING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS AND ACTIONS TO BLOCK 
TERRORIST ASSETS, ENACT NEW COUNTER TERRORISM LAWS, AND 
RATIFY EXISTING TREATIES. 
 
-- The Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act (2001) provides 
UK authorities with the power to detain indefinitely foreign 
nationals suspected of being international terrorists, but 
who cannot be removed from the UK immediately.  Since the act 
came into force in December 2001, 16 foreign nationals have 
been detained using its powers.  Of the total detained, two 
have voluntarily left the UK.  The others remain in 
detention.  The names of the detainees are not public. 
 
-- Between October 2002 and October 2003, the UK issued 25 
terrorist asset freeze orders against 74 individuals and 15 
organizations.  Two of the orders implemented the European 
Union\'s September 2003 decision to freeze all funds, other 
financial assets, and economic resources of Hamas. 
 
-- The UK did not enact major new counter terrorism 
legislation in 2003.  The UK has ratified all 12 UN Counter 
Terrorism Conventions. 
 
3. (U) B) DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THE 
UK TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS 
OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 2003, INCLUDING ANY HOST 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM.  PARTICULAR 
ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ACTIONS REGARDING ACTS OF 
TERRORISM AGAINST OR AFFECTING U.S. CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
-- UK security and law enforcement authorities have disrupted 
numerous terrorist attacks by dissident Irish republican, 
particularly the Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA) and the 
Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA) as well as loyalist 
paramilitary groups. In one significant disruption, the 
Police Service of Northern Ireland intercepted a 1,200 pound 
car bomb in Londonderry in June that was linked to the REAL 
IRA. 
 
-- HMG continues its investigation of the 1998 bombing in 
Omagh, which killed 29 people. 
 
-- Between October 2002 and October 2003, 59 new 
terrorism-related cases have been presented to the Crown 
Prosecution Service by the police, either for advice on 
whether or how to proceed with the investigation or for 
prosecution. 
 
-- On April 1, 2003, a jury in Leicestershire convicted 
Brahim Benmerzouga and Baghdad Mezaine on charges related to 
terrorist fund raising.  The two were sentences to 11 years 
in jail. 
 
-- In connection with a long-running investigation into a 
group of North Africans involved in the 
production/importation of toxins, including ricin, into the 
UK, UK authorities have charged nine individuals with 
conspiracy to murder and other related charges.  Trials for 
the nine are scheduled to begin in April and September 2004. 
One of the individuals, Kamel Borgass, has been charged with 
the murder of Greater Manchester Police Officer Stephen Oake, 
who was attacked an killed during a January 14 raid connected 
with the investigation. 
 
4. (U) C) DID THE UK EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR? 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
RESPONSES TO U.S. REQUESTS FOR EXTRADITION OR ASSISTANCE IN 
TERRORIST CASES. 
 
-- A bilateral Extradition Treaty, which entered into force 
on January 21, 1977, and a Supplementary Treaty, which 
entered into force on December 23, 1986, govern extradition 
between the U.S. and the UK. 
 
-- The U.S. and UK completed negotiation on a new Extradition 
Treaty in 2003, which will streamline the extradition 
process.  The new treaty has not yet been ratified by either 
country, however. 
 
-- There have been no terrorism-related extraditions in the 
past year to the U.S. 
 
-- The UK continues to assist with the U.S. request for the 
extradition of Khaled Al-Fawwaz, Adel Abdel Bary, and Ibrahim 
 
Eidarous to the U.S. for their involvement in the bombing of 
the U.S. Embassies in East Africa.  In December 2001, the Law 
Lords, the UK\'s highest court, rejected their appeal to block 
the extradition.  These cases then passed to the Home 
Secretary for final decision as to whether these individuals 
would be extradited.  However, all three exercised their 
legal right to make representations to the Home Secretary 
against their surrender to the U.S.  Those representations 
gave rise to a set of inquiries on a range of issues from the 
Home Office to the U.S., which were made in March 2002.  In 
the intervening 18 months, there has been regular contact 
between U.S. officials and the Home Office, including replies 
to some, though not all, UK inquiries. 
 
-- The U.S. has also requested the extradition of Abu Doha in 
connection with the December 1999 plot by Ahmed Ressam and 
others to attack Los Angeles International Airport.  The U.S. 
request survived the judicial stages of the UK extradition 
process.  As in the case of the Embassy bombers, his case is 
also now before the Home Secretary.  Doha made 
representations against his surrender in January 2003.  These 
were sent to U.S. officials in May for reply. 
 
5. (U) D) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO UK 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS. 
 
-- It is UK policy to prosecute and/or extradite suspected 
terrorists consistent with UK law, the European Convention on 
Human Rights, and the 1951 Convention on Refugees.  UK law 
requires prima facie evidence in support of an extradition 
request and does not allow extradition to occur where the 
request is believed to be made for the purpose of punishing a 
person on account of his/her race, religion or political 
opinion.  UK law does not allow the extradition of 
individuals if they would face the death penalty where there 
is the possibility that the sentence may be carried out.  In 
death penalty cases, the UK would seek assurances that the 
sentence would be waived before agreeing to extradition. 
 
-- In November 2002, the Government introduced legislation to 
streamline and shorten the UK extradition process. It became 
law in November 2003 and eliminates duplication of hearings 
and appeals that were part of the old system.  The 
legislation also simplifies the rules on authenticating 
foreign documents so that faxed documents would be accepted 
as valid.  However, cases that were pending under the old 
system must be completed under the old rules. 
 
6. (U) E) DISCUSS UK RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION.  THESE 
WOULD INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OR OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCIES FOLLOWING A 
TERRORIST INCIDENT (IN OR OUTSIDE THE UK) AND EFFORTS BY THE 
UK TO INVESTIGATE TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TO ASSIST WITH 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
-- The UK regularly condemns terrorist attacks, and this 
practice continued in 2003.  The UK condemned the May 2003 Al 
Qaida terrorist attacks in Casablanca and Riyadh and the 
attacks in Iraq against the Jordanian Embassy, the United 
Nations, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
The UK also condemned the separate attacks in November on two 
synagogues and the British Consulate and a British bank in 
Istanbul. 
 
-- The UK regularly engages in public diplomacy aimed at 
highlighting the global nature of the threat posed by the 
al-Qaida network and urging other countries to respond 
vigorously to terrorist incidents and threats. 
 
-- UK law enforcement officials have assisted with 
investigations into the 2003 terrorist attacks in Saudi 
Arabia and Morocco, the 2002 attack in Bali, and the 2003 
suicide attacks by British nationals in Israel.  In Israel, 
UK authorities have worked closely with Israeli authorities 
on all aspects of the investigation, and in May 2003, the UK 
charged two UK resident with terrorism-related offences in 
connection with the suicide attack.  Finally, UK law 
enforcement is working closely with Turkish authorities on 
the investigations  into the November 2003 Istanbul bombings. 
 
7. (U) F) DESCRIBE MAJOR COUNTER TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN 
IN 2003 BY THE UK, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN INTERNATIONAL 
FORA. 
 
-- The UK actively campaigns in international fora, including 
the EU, NATO, OSCE, G-8, and United Nations, for coordinated 
global efforts to combat terrorism and routinely lobbies UN 
Member States to ratify the twelve international conventions 
and protocol relating to terrorism. 
 
-- The UK actively supported efforts to broaden categories of 
man portable air defense systems under the Waasenaar 
Arrangement in order to ensure that these systems do not fall 
 
into the hands of terrorists. 
 
-- The UK supported the G-8\'s 2003 initiative to create the 
Counter Terrorism Action Group (CTAG) and is an active CTAG 
participant. 
 
-- In addition, the UK launched a new assistance program in 
2003 aimed at increasing international capacity to counter 
terrorism and other threats in support of UK\'s bilateral and 
multilateral counter terrorism policy objectives.  The 
program is focused on countries and issues assessed to 
present the greatest threat to the UK interests.  The UK 
anticipates spending approximately 4 million BPS in UK fiscal 
year 2003/04 on projects in three major categories: (1) 
Operational counter terrorism assistance aimed as counter 
terrorism experts in foreign governments, police and 
military; (2) Assistance to support the work of the UN\'s 
Counter Terrorism Committee, and; (3) Wider capacity building 
initiatives. 
 
8. (U) G) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT UK SUPPORT FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS OR TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
-- The UK does not provide support for international 
terrorism, terrorists or terrorist groups. 
 
9. (U) H) HAS THE UK MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE? 
 
-- The UK has not made any public statements in support of a 
terrorist-supporting country on a terrorism issue and 
consistently and strongly condemns all acts of and support 
for terrorism. 
 
10. I) DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 2002, POSITIVE 
OR NEGATIVE, IN THE UK\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC. 
 
-- There has been no significant change since 2002.  The UK 
has been and remains one of the United States\' strongest 
allies in the fight against terrorism.  Elimination of 
terrorism as a force in international affairs is a primary 
objective of UK foreign policy.
