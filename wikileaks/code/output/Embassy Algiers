SUBJECT:  ALGERIA AND THE ARAB WORLD:  MOVING FROM 
          RADICALISM TO MEDIATION 
 
REF:  KPRP-4 (FY-87) 
 
1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2. SUMMARY:  UNLIKE ITS SELF-PERCEIVED LEADERSHIP 
ROLE IN AFRICA, ALGERIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO POSITION 
ITSELF IN THE ARAB WORLD AS A MEDIATOR/PEACEMAKER 
AT THE CENTER OF COMPETING FACTIONS AND INTERESTS. 
ALGERIA IS NO LONGER IN THE FOREFRONT OF RADICAL 
ARAB CAUSES, ALTHOUGH IT STILL TRADES ON THE 
FORMER ASSOCIATIONS IT ESTABLISHED UNDER BOUMEDIENE 
AND THUS RETAINS ACCESS TO VIRTUALLY ALL ARAB 
GROUPS.  REFLECTING PRESIDENT BENDJEDID\'S OWN 
CONSENSUS-BUILDING DOMESTIC STYLE, ALGERIA HAS 
WORKED FOR THE CREATION OF A GREATER ARAB MAGHREB 
AS AN UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION UNDER WHICH REGIONAL 
PROBLEMS MIGHT BE SOLVED AND HAS ATTEMPTED TO 
PROMOTE PLO UNITY AS A MEANS OF MOVING THE MIDDLE 
EAST PEACE PROCESS FORWARD (IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
RECONCILIATION EFFORTS IN LEBANON).  ALTHOUGH 
PESSIMISTIC ABOUT FINDING A CONCILIATORY 
BASIS FOR NEGOTIATIONS IN THE GULF WAR, ALGERIA HAS 
PERSISTED IN SEEKING OPENINGS TO ACHIEVE AT LEAST 
A CEASEFIRE THERE.  RELATIONS WITH THE MIDDLE EAST 
CONFRONTATION STATES OF SYRIA AND JORDAN HAVE 
WAXED AND WANED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, AS HAVE 
TIES WITH THE GULF STATES, PARTICULARLY SAUDI 
ARABIA.  ALGERIA REMAINS ACTIVE IN THE ARAB LEAGUE 
AND ITS VARIOUS SUB-ORGANIZATIONS, BUT IS SKEPTICAL 
ABOUT THE VITALITY OF THE LEAGUE AND ITS ABILITY 
TO UNITE, INSTEAD OF DIVIDE, ITS MEMBER STATES. 
ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH OTHER ARAB STATES ARE BASED 
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON PETROLEUM--ITS PRICE AND 
THE QUANTITIES MARKETED.  AS A PRICE \"HARDLINER,\" 
ALGERIA OFTEN FINDS ITSELF AT ODDS WITH ITS 
FELLOW ARAB PRODUCERS WITHIN OPEC.  THE GOA 
LEADERSHIP ALSO DEVOTES CONSIDERABLE ENERGY TO 
ADVANCING ITS INTERESTS IN THE ARAB WORLD, AT 
LEAST IN PART TO ENCOURAGE GREATER STABILITY AS 
A HEDGE AGAINST THE POTENTIAL ENCROACHMENT OF 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM INTO NORTH AFRICA. 
 
3. AS A CREDIBLE GO-BETWEEN WITH MOST ARAB GROUPS, 
ALGERIA HAS CONTRIBUTED IMPORTANTLY TO THE ACHIEVE- 
MENT OF SOME U.S. REGIONAL OBJECTIVES, FROM 
THE MEDIATION OF THE IRAN HOSTAGE CRISIS IN 1980/81 
TO PRESENT GOA EFFORTS IN LEBANON, AS WELL AS 
ACTING AS A COUNTER TO LIBYAN INFLUENCE.  ALGERIA 
WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY 
WITH THE U.S. ON TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC APPROACHES 
TO RESOLVING NUMEROUS ARAB-RELATED ISSUES, EVEN 
WHERE WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL.  HOWEVER, UNLIKE 
UNDER BOUMEDIENE, THE BENDJEDID REGIME IS PREPARED 
TO \"REASON WITH US\" AND EXPLORE POTENTIALLY WORKABLE 
SOLUTIONS FREE OF THE RHETORIC WHICH PREVIOUSLY 
CHARACTERIZED ALGERIAN POLICYMAKING.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------- 
THE MAGHREB 
----------- 
 
4. FOR ALGERIA, ITS POLICY IN THE ARAB WORLD BEGINS 
WITH THE MAGHREB AND EFFORTS TO FOSTER REGIONAL 
STABILITY, PARTICULARLY ALONG ITS BORDERS.  TO 
FURTHER THIS GOAL THE GOA HAS PROMOTED A POLICY OF 
REGIONAL UNITY UNDER THE RUBRIC OF A \"GREATER ARAB 
MAGHREB\" AND HAS CONCLUDED A FRIENDSHIP AND CONCORD 
TREATY WITH TWO OF ITS MAGHREB NEIGHBORS, TUNISIA 
AND MAURITANIA.  WHILE A FUNCTIONING MAGHREB 
ORGANIZATION IS STILL IN THE DISTANCE, THE IDEA 
OFFERS ALGERIA A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IN WHICH TO 
SEEK RESOLUTION OF SOME OF ITS MAJOR REGIONAL 
PREOCCUPATIONS.  THE GOA BELIEVES A MAGHREB ORGANIZA- 
TION COULD PROVIDE AN INSTITUTIONAL COVER FOR A 
WESTERN SAHARA SOLUTION AND ALSO RESOLVE ALGERIA\'S 
OUTSTANDING BORDER PROBLEMS WITH MOROCCO AND LIBYA. 
IN ALGERIA\'S VIEW IT WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR 
GREATLY EXPANDING ECONOMIC COOPERATION THROUGH 
COMPLEMENTARY ECONOMIES AND A POSSIBLE FREE TRADE 
ZONE PATTERNED AFTER THE COMMON MARKET.  THE GOA 
BELIEVES IMPROVED REGIONAL TIES WOULD ENHANCE 
POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR A 
PEACEFUL TRANSITION IN TUNISIA AFTER BOURGUIBA. 
FINALLY, THE GOA HOPES THAT THE POTENTIAL ADHERENCE 
BY LIBYA TO SUCH A REGIONAL GROUPING WOULD 
MODERATE QADHAFI\'S BEHAVIOR TO SOME EXTENT AND 
INCREASE HIS STAKE IN COOPERATION. 
 
5. DESPITE ALGERIA\'S ASPIRATIONS FOR A GREATER 
MAGHREB AS A SOURCE OF REGIONAL UNITY AND STRENGTH, 
THE GOAL DOES NOT APPEAR ANY CLOSER TO REALIZATION 
NOW THAN PRIOR TO THE MOROCCAN-LIBYAN ACCORD OF 
AUGUST 1984.  ALGERIA\'S BILATERAL STRAINS WITH 
MOROCCO AND THE CONTINUING UNWILLINGNESS BY QADHAFI 
TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF 
ALGERIA\'S AGREEMENT WITH TUNISIA AND MAURITANIA 
MILITATE AGAINST A UNITED MAGHREB.  IN ADDITION, 
THE WESTERN SAHARA CONFLICT REMAINS A MAJOR COMPLI- 
CATING FACTOR BLOCKING GREATER REGIONAL COOPERATION. 
 
6. GIVEN THE UNCERTAIN PROSPECTS FOR A GREATER 
MAGHREB, THE GOA NEVERTHELESS DIRECTS ITS POLICIES 
TOWARD ITS NEIGHBORS AS IF SUCH A SCHEME MIGHT 
BE ACHIEVABLE.  WITH TUNISIA THE GOA FOLLOWS AN 
ACTIVE POLICY OF PROMOTING ECONOMIC COOPERATION, 
PROVIDING ASSURANCES AND MATERIAL SUPPORT 
TO COUNTER LIBYAN PRESSURES AGAINST THE GOT, 
EXCHANGING HIGH-LEVEL VISITS TO COORDINATE SOME 
REGIONAL ACTIONS AND MAINTAINING AS CLOSE TIES 
AS POSSIBLE WITH A VIEW TOWARD A PEACEFUL, POST- 
BOURGUIBA TRANSITION.  ON LIBYA, GOA POLICY HAS 
MOVED AWAY FROM RADICAL SOLIDARITY AS A MEMBER OF 
THE \"REJECTIONIST FRONT\" TO ONE OF SOMETIMES OPEN 
AND OTHER TIMES DISGUISED OPPOSITION TO THE 
QADHAFI REGIME.  ALGERIA OPENLY OPPOSES LIBYAN 
ACTIONS IN CHAD AND ITS SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES IN WESTERN EUROPE.  THE GOA ATTEMPTS 
TO COUNTER LIBYAN INFLUENCE IN WEST AFRICA, SUDAN, 
AND EVEN AMONG RADICAL ARAB FACTIONS.  DESPITE 
THESE POLICY DIFFERENCES, ALGERIA HAS, SINCE THE 
BEGINNING OF 1986, TRIED TO EASE BILATERAL TENSIONS 
THROUGH A MEASURED PUBLIC RAPPROCHEMENT WITH LIBYA. 
THIS POLICY HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED TO US BY 
BENDJEDID\'S ADVISOR GENERAL BELKHEIR AS A MEANS 
OF FOLLOWING THE LIBYAN DOMESTIC SITUATION CLOSELY 
WHILE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH WHICH 
IT CAN MODIFY QADHAFI\'S BEHAVIOR OR HIS POSITION 
WITHOUT RUINING FUTURE RELATIONS WITH A POST-QADHAFI 
LIBYA. 
 
7. CURIOUSLY, ALGERIANS FEEL THE CLOSEST AFFINITY 
WITH MOROCCANS EVEN THOUGH IN GEOPOLITICAL TERMS 
MOROCCO IS THE ONLY COUNTRY WHICH COULD LAY 
PLAUSIBLE CLAIM TO BEING A REGIONAL RIVAL.  FOR 
THE MOMENT, THAT RIVALRY IS FOCUSED ON THE WESTERN 
SAHARA CONFLICT, WHICH APPEARS STALEMATED BOTH 
MILITARILY AND DIPLOMATICALLY.  IT IS LIKELY THAT 
THE GOA WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO ISOLATE MOROCCO 
WITHIN THE REGION, IN THE ARA8 WORLD AND IN AFRICA, 
AS A MEANS OF INCREASING PRESSURE FOR A NEGOTIATED 
POLITICAL SETTLEMENT TO THE WESTERN SAHARA CONFLICT. 
HAVING SUPPORTED THE POLISARIO CAUSE FOR THE PAST 
TEN YEARS, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF DECOLONIALIZATION 
FOR EVEN LONGER, THE GOA LEADERSHIP IS NOT LIKELY 
TO ABANDON THE POLISARIO AND CEDE SOVEREIGNTY TO 
MOROCCO WITHOUT A CREDIBLE POLITICAL PROCESS BEING 
ESTABLISHED TO SETTLE THE ISSUE.  UNTIL THEN, 
DESPITE THE VOICED BEST INTENTIONS OF THE TWO 
GOVERNMENTS, BILATERAL RELATIONS WILL REMAIN COM- 
PETITIVE RATHER THAN COOPERATIVE, WITH THE RISK OF 
DIRECT CONFRONTATION BEING LOW.  ON THE MARGINS 
WILL BE COMPETITION FOR INFLUENCE IN MAURITANIA 
IN WHICH THE GOA COMPETES FOR INFLUENCE THROUGH 
ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE GIRM. 
 
----- 
EGYPT 
----- 
8. EGYPT, AT THE EDGE OF THE MAGHREB, HAS HAD 
ALTERNATELY WARM AND COOL RELATIONS WITH ALGERIA. 
DURING ALGERIA\'S INDEPENDENCE STRUGGLE NASSER\'S 
EGYPT PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT MILITARY TRAINING AND 
ASSISTANCE.  MANY OF THE ALGERIAN SOLDIERS WHO 
SURVIVED ON THAT AID HAVE ATTAINED RANKING POSITIONS 
WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY AND ARE A 
SOURCE OF WARM PERSONAL CONTACTS FOR EGYPT. 
HOWEVER, THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS OF 1978 PUSHED 
BOUMEDIENE\'S ALGERIA INTO BECOMING AN ACTIVE MEMBER 
OF THE \"REJECTIONIST FRONT\" TO MOBILIZE ARAB 
EFFORTS TO ISOLATE EGYPT.  BUT BENDJEDID BEGAN 
TO MOVE ALGERIA GRADUALLY BACK TOWARD EGYPT IN 
THE EARLY 1980\'S.  THE PACE OF THIS RAPPROCHEMENT 
HAS ACCELERATED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, ESPECIALLY 
SINCE AUGUST 1984 WHEN, IN THE WAKE OF THE OUJDA 
ACCORD, ALGERIA SOUGHT TO BALANCE AN INCREASED 
THREAT IT PERCEIVED FROM LIBYA WITH GREATER 
COORDINATION ON INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION AND THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF JOINT SECURITY MEASURES WITH 
EGYPT ALONG LIBYA\'S EASTERN AND WESTERN BORDERS. 
HIGH-LEVEL VISITS HAVE BECOME MORE FREQUENT AND 
VISIBLE, AS HAVE CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES. 
IN RECENT MONTHS, THE PACE OF IMPROVING RELATIONS 
HAS SLOWED, PERHAPS AS A RESULT OF IMPROVING 
EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI RELATIONS BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF A 
DIMINISHED LIBYAN \"THREAT.\"  NEVERTHELESS, 
SUBSTANTIVE HIGH-LEVEL CONTACTS CONTINUE, WITH 
THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF MONITORING AND INFLUENCING 
QADHAFI\'S BEHAVIOR.  IT IS NOT LIKELY THE GOA 
WILL RE-ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH EGYPT ANYTIME 
SOON, BUT COOPERATION WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS 
EACH ATTEMPTS TO PURSUE ITS INTERESTS--ALGERIA 
TO FORESTALL ANOTHER SHIFT IN EGYPTIAN POLICY ON 
THE WESTERN SAHARA BACK TO FAVORING MOROCCO 
(EGYPT SUPPORTED THE ALGERIAN POSITION IN THE 1985 
UNGA) AND EGYPT TO MAINTAINING SYMPATHETIC ACCESS 
TO ARAB \"RADICAL\" STATES AND GROUPS THROUGH 
ALGERIA WHEN NECESSARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
PALESTINE AND THE PALESTINIANS 
------------------------------ 
 
9. ALGERIA HAS ALWAYS PRIDED ITSELF AS BEING ONE 
OF THE STRONGEST SUPPORTERS OF THE PALESTINIAN 
CAUSE AND OF ITS MAJOR POLITICAL/MILITARY ORGANIZA- 
TION, THE PLO.  ALGERIA\'S OWN EXPERIENCE IN GAINING 
INDEPENDENCE HEAVILY INFLUENCES ITS VIEW OF THE 
PALESTINIAN ISSUE AND ITS BELIEF THAT THE PALESTINIAN 
PEOPLE MUST HAVE THEIR OWN LAND IN WHICH THEY CAN 
EXPRESS THEIR NATIONAL CHARACTER.  AS ALGERIA WAS 
ABLE TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE ONLY THROUGH THE 
UNITY THE FLN DEMONSTRATED IN THE FACE OF THE 
FRENCH \"OCCUPATION,\" SO THE LOCAL CATECHISM GOES, 
THE PLO WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN ITS HOMELAND ONLY 
THROUGH A SIMILAR POLICY OF UNITY.  THEREFORE, THE 
GOA BELIEVES PLO UNIFICATION IS ESSENTIAL IF THERE 
IS TO BE ANY CHANCE OF SUCCESS FOR PEACE IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST.  ALGERIA ACKNOWLEDGES THERE ARE 
SERIOUS IDEOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY DIFFERENCES 
WITHIN THE PLO, BUT HAS URGED THE PLO TO SUBMERGE 
THESE DIFFERENCES BEHIND A FACADE OF UNITY. 
ALGERIA\'S OVERRIDING CONCERN WITH UNITY HAS 
TENDED TO MAKE ALGERIA A SUPPORTER OF PLO CHIEF 
ARAFAT WHO THE GOA BELIEVES IS THE ONLY PALESTINIAN 
LEADER WHO HAS THE STATURE AND BROAD FOLLOWING TO 
UNITE THE PALESTINIAN MOVEMENT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE 
GOA DIFFERS  WITH ARAFAT ON STRATEGY AND TACTICS, 
AS IT DID IN EARLY 1985 OVER THE HOLDING OF THE 
PNC IN JORDAN AND THE SUBSEQUENT AMMAN ACCORD. 
(THE GOA REFRAINED FROM PUBLIC DENUNCIATION BUT 
PRIVATELY EXPRESSED STRONG SKEPTICISM THAT THE 
AMMAN ACCORD COULD HAVE ANY POSITIVE EFFECT ON 
THE PEACE PROCESS.) 
 
10. SINCE MARCH 1986 THE GOA HAS ATTEMPTED TO GIVE 
SUBSTANCE TO ITS PRINCIPLES ON PLO UNITY.  FOLLOW- 
ING BENDJEDID\'S MARCH 25-28 VISIT TO MOSCOW, HE 
LAUNCHED A MAJOR INITIATIVE TO HOLD A UNITY MEETING 
IN ALGIERS OF THE NINE PLO EXECUTIVE COUNCIL 
FACTIONS.  OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS THE GOA HAS 
SENT SPECIAL MISSIONS TO SYRIA, LIBYA, AND THE 
USSR, AS WELL AS RECEIVED MOST OF THE SIGNIFICANT 
PLO LEADERS IN ALGIERS.  THUS FAR, ALGERIAN EFFORTS 
HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED BY CONTINUING INTERNAL PLO 
DIFFERENCES, THE UNWILLINGNESS OF SYRIA TO CONTRIBUTE 
TO A PLO UNITED BEHIND ARAFAT, AND A LACK 
OF SUFFICIENT SOVIET LEVERAGE ON SYRIA TO FORCE 
SYRIAN COOPERATION.  DESPITE THESE SETBACKS, THE 
GOA WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR PLO UNITY, WHILE 
PROVIDING MODEST MILITARY TRAINING WITHIN ALGERIA, 
AS THE ONLY MEANS, IN THE GOA VIEW, OF OBTAINING 
A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
 
11. CONCURRENTLY, THE GOA MAINTAINS SOME ACCESS TO 
THE MARGINAL \"RADICAL\" FACTIONS IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST, INCLUDING ABU NIDAL, ABU MUSA, AND HIZBOLLAH. 
ALGERIA HAS SERVED AS A CONDUIT TO THESE GROUPS ON 
VARIOUS HOSTAGE ISSUES, BUT ALSO HAS ACQUIRED 
INTELLIGENCE ON THEIR LEADERSHIP AND STRUCTURES. 
IN SOME CASES, THE GOA HAS BEEN WILLING TO SHARE 
THIS INTELLIGENCE WITH NON-ARAB COUNTRIES.  UNLIKE 
THE BOUMEDIENE GOVERNMENT, THE PRESENT ALGERIAN 
REGIME APPARENTLY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE TO THESE FACTIONS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
RELATIONS WITH THE MIDDLE EAST CONFRONTATION STATES 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
12. ALGERIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO PLAY A MEDIATING ROLE 
IN LEBANON WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF CREATING 
A STABLE ARAB BASE FROM WHICH MORE EFFECTIVE 
CONFRONTATION WITH ISRAEL COULD BE ORGANIZED.  IN 
THE PROCESS THE GOA HOPES TO PRESERVE THE LIVES 
OF PALESTINIAN REFUGEES WHO ARE ENCAMPED IN LEBANON, 
END THE INTERNECINE KILLING AMONG ALGERIA\'S ARAB 
BROTHERS, ENCOURAGE THE WITHDRAWAL OF SYRIAN TROOPS, 
EXPEL ISRAELI TROOPS FROM SOUTHERN LEBANON, AND 
EVENTUALLY RE-ESTABLISH A VIABLE LEBANESE STATE-- 
ALL IN ALL A TALL ORDER.  THE GOA HAS MOVED 
CAUTIOUSLY TO ACHIEVE RECONCILIATION IN LEBANON, 
USING ITS FORMER AMBASSADOR (ABDELKRIM GHERAIEB) 
TO OPEN CONTACTS WITH ALL LEBANESE GROUPS AND SEEK 
OPPORTUNITIES TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER TALKS AMONG 
THESE GROUPS.  ALGERIAN CONTACTS WITH NABIH BERRI\'S 
AMAL WERE PARTICULARLY USEFUL DURING THE JUNE 1985 
TWA HIJACKING TO SECURE THE RELEASE OF AMERICAN 
CITIZENS AND MAINTAIN COMMUNICATIONS WITH U.S. 
HOSTAGES REMAINING IN LEBANON.  ALTHOUGH ALGERIA 
HAS SUSPENDED ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ARAB 
LEAGUE\'S SOLIDARITY FUND FOR LEBANON, IT REMAINS 
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN LEBANESE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION 
EFFORTS, RECENTLY DISPATCHING A SPECIAL ENVOY 
(MINISTER OF CULTURE BOUALEM BESSAIEH) AND A 
RANKING FLN PARTY MEMBER (SADEK ZOUATEN) TO EXPLORE 
THE PROSPECTS FOR PROGRESS.  ALGERIA DOES PROVIDE 
SOME BILATERAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF 200 
UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS ANNUALLY, BUT NOT MUCH 
FINANCIAL AID DESPITE GEMAYEL\'S BEST EFFORTS. 
OVER THE NEXT YEAR, THE GOA IS LIKELY TO MAINTAIN 
AN ACTIVELY NEUTRAL \"WATCHING BRIEF\" IN LEBANON 
RATHER THAN RISK ITS PRESTIGE IN A DRAMATIC POLICY 
INITIATIVE. 
 
13. RELATIONS WITH JORDAN HAVE IMPROVED CONSIDERABLY 
SINCE THE LATE 1970\'S, INCLUDING AN EXCHANGE OF 
HIGH-RANKING MILITARY DELEGATIONS AND THE VISIT OF 
THE JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER IN 1985.  THE MILITARY 
EXCHANGES WERE USEFUL FOR THE GOA BECAUSE THEY 
PROVIDED FURTHER INSIGHTS ON HOW TO APPROACH AND 
DEAL WITH WESTERN ARMS SUPPLIERS, NOTABLY THE U.K. 
AND THE U.S., WITH WHOM ALGERIA HOPES TO DIVERSIFY 
ITS ARMS PURCHASES.  SECONDLY, THE GOA WAS EXPOSED 
TO WESTERN ARMS SYSTEMS AND THEIR CAPABILITIES. 
DESPITE CRITICISM FROM RADICAL ARAB FACTIONS AND 
STATES OF THE AMMAN ACCORD, ALGERIA RESERVED ITS 
JUDGMENT, THUS PRESERVING ITS ENTREE WITH THE 
JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT.  OTHERWISE, BILATERAL 
RELATIONS ARE CORDIAL WITHOUT BEIMG PARTICULARLY 
PROFOUND.  WHAT IS NOTEWORTHY IS THAT ALGERIA NOW 
RECOGNIZES THE VALUE OF MAINTAINING CORDIAL TIES 
WITH ARAB \"MODERATES\" (EVEN MONARCHS), A 
RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF SUCH TIES THAT ONLY 
FAINTLY EXISTED IN THE PRE-BENDJEDID ERA. 
 
14. PERHAPS ALGERIA\'S MOST FRUSTRATING POLITICAL 
RELATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST ARE WITH SYRIA, A 
COUNTRY WITH WHICH ALGERIA USED TO SHARE AN 
IDEOLOGICAL AFFINITY AND INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK. 
THE IDEOLOGICAL AFFINITY HAS BEEN FADING RAPIDLY 
IN RECENT YEARS, AND ALGERIA\'S INTERNATIONAL 
PERSPECTIVE HAS BEGUN TO DIVERGE SIGNIFICANTLY 
FROM THAT OF SYRIA IN THE PAST 18 MONTHS.  ALGERIA 
NO LONGER FINDS ITSELF ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A 
REJECTIONIST FRONT MEETING AND IS RELUCTANT TO 
RECONSTITUTE SUCH A FRONT.  WHILE SYRIA SUPPORTS 
ALGERIA ON THE WESTERN SAHARA AND COOPERATES WITH 
ALGERIA IN EFFORTS TO ISOLATE MOROCCO, IT REMAINS 
THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO ALGERIA\'S ATTEMPT TO UNIFY 
THE PLO. ALGERIA HAS ALSO BEEN CRITICAL OF SYRIA\'S 
ROLE IN LEBANON (AS A COMPLICATING FACTOR 
PREVENTING RECONCILIATION) AND HAS BEEN UNHAPPY 
WITH SYRIA\'S SUPPORT FOR HIZBOLLAHS \"TERRORIST\" 
ACTIVITIES.  NEVERTHELESS, THE TWO COUNTRIES 
MAINTAIN VERY ACTIVE HIGH-LEVEL CONTACTS TO 
COORDINATE POLICIES OF MUTUAL INTEREST, WITH THE 
GOA HOPING FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT ON PLO UNITY 
AND SYRIA HOPING TO EXCHANGE THIS FOR A NEW 
REJECTIONIST FRONT. 
 
------------ 
THE GULF WAR 
------------ 
 
15. THE WAR BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ, LIKE THEIR 
PREVIOUS DISPUTE IN THE 1970\'S MEDIATED BY ALGERIA, 
IS AN ONGOING CONCERN FOR THE GOA.  IN DISCUSSING 
THE SITUATION, FOREIGN MINISTER IBRAHIMI IS ALWAYS 
QUICK TO POINT OUT HIS PREDECESSER LOST HIS LIFE 
TRYING TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE WAR.  PERHAPS 
BECAUSE OF THIS SETBACK, AND ALGERIAN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
OF THE CONTINUING INTRANSIGENCE OF BOTH PARTIES, THE 
GOA HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO TAKE ANY NEW INITIATIVE 
ON THE WAR.  IN THE INTERIM ALGERIA HAS MAINTAINED 
ITS CREDIBILITY WITH IRAN BY ABSTAINING ON ONE- 
SIDED ARAB LEAGUE RESOLUTIONS FAVORING IRAQ AND 
CONTINUING HIGH-LEVEL EXCHANGES.  THE GOA HAS USED 
THESE CONTACTS TO PROBE IRANIAN FLEXIBILITY, THUS 
FAR WITHOUT ANY POSITIVE RESULTS, ADDING TO THE 
PESSIMISM IBRAHIMI HAS EXPRESSED TO US.  RECENT 
IRANIAN GAINS AND OCCUPATION OF IRAQI TERRITORY 
HAVE \"TILTED\" ALGERIAN POLICY TOWARD IRAQ.  HOWEVER, 
ALGERIA IS ONE OF THE ONLY COUNTRIES WHICH CAN 
APPROACH EITHER IRAN OR IRAQ TO ARRANGE A CEASEFIRE 
THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. 
 
-------------------------------- 
SAUDI ARABIA AND THE GULF STATES 
-------------------------------- 
 
16. ALGERIAN RELATIONS IN THE GULF, AS FOR OTHER 
COUNTRIES, REVOLVE AROUND TIES WITH SAUDI ARABIA. 
IN THIS REGARD, WHILE THE TENOR OF GOA-SAG RELATIONS 
HAS IMPROVED TO THE LEVEL OF A POLITE DIALOGUE, 
THERE ARE MAJOR SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCES PREVENTING 
CLOSER COOPERATION.  SIMILAR TO THE SAUDIS, THE 
ALGERIANS ARE QUICK TO TAKE OFFENSE AT PERCEIVED 
SLIGHTS AND THEY ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE 
ETIQUETTE OF RELATIONS, GRANTING OR WITHDRAWING 
ACCESS FOR SAUDI EMISSARIES DEPENDING ON TREATMENT 
ACCORDED TO ALGERIANS.  BEYOND SUCH ATMOSPHERIC 
ISSUES, THE GOA HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF SAUDI SUPPORT 
FOR THE MOROCCAN WAR EFFORT IN THE WESTERN SAHARA, 
SAUDI STRATEGY WITHIN OPEC, AND SAUDI PARTICIPATION 
IN THE EXTRAORDINARY ARAB SUMMIT ORGANIZED IN 
CASABLANCA IN AUGUST 1985.  FM IBRAHIMI HAS ALSO 
VOICED IMPATIENCE OVER REPEATED SAUDI REQUESTS FOR 
ALGERIAN INTERVENTION WITH \"RADICAL\" ARABS WITHOUT 
RECEIVING RECIPROCAL SAUDI SUPPORT ON THE WESTERN 
SAHARA.  NEVERTHELESS, ALGERIA RECOGNIZES THE 
DEGREE OF SAUDI INFLUENCE WITHIN OPEC, THE ARAB 
LEAGUE AND WITH THE MOROCCAN GOVERNMENT, AND 
HAS ATTEMPTED TO EMPLOY A QUIET DIPLOMACY IN THE 
PAST YEAR TO MODIFY SAUDI POLICIES.  THE GOA GIVES 
ITSELF CREDIT FOR SOME PROGRESS WITHIN OPEC AND 
IS MODESTLY OPTIMISTIC THAT SAUDI ARABIA WILL 
AGREE TO HOLD AN ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT IN DECEMBER 
TO \"CLOSE ARAB RANKS.\"  (THIS WOULD BE THE LONG- 
DELAYED SUMMIT ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR 1984.) 
ON THE WESTERN SAHARA, THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE. 
 
17. ALGERIA MAINTAINS CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH KUWAIT, 
THE UAE, AND OMAN.  THE GOA JUST ASSIGNED NEW 
RESIDENT AMBASSADORS TO BAHRAIN AND QATAR, AND THIS 
MAY PORTEND AN UPSURGE IN THE IMPORTANCE OF 
BILATERAL RELATIONS.  HOWEVER, RELATIONS 
ARE LIKELY TO FOCUS CHIEFLY ON OIL PRICING AND 
PERHAPS SECONDARILY ON KEEPING THE \"WOLF\" OF ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM AWAY FROM THE GULF\'S DOOR.  FURTHER 
SOUTHWEST, ALGERIA WAS DISTURBED BY THE OVERTHROW 
OF THE ALI NASIR MUHAMED REGIME IN SOUTH YEMEN AND 
THE SOVIET ROLE IN SUPPORTING HIS SUCCESSOR.  THE 
GOA LEADERSHIP DERIVED A CERTAIN LESSON FROM THESE 
EVENTS AND HAS INFUSED A COOLNESS INTO ITS 
FORMERLY CLOSE RELATIONS WITH SOUTH YEMEN. 
INFREQUENT CONTACTS PERSIST WITH ALI NASIR MUHAMED, 
ALTHOUGH THE ALGERIANS HAVE NOT ASSISTED ANY 
EFFORTS TO OVERTHROW THE ATTAS GOVERNMGNT.  ON 
THE CONTRARY, THERE HAS BEEN A RELUCTANT ACCEPTANCE 
OF ATTAS, WHO IS EXPECTED TO VISIT ALGIERS 
LATER THIS YEAR OR IN EARLY 1987.  AS FOR NORTH 
YEMEN, THE YAR JUST APPOINTED A NEW AMBASSADOR 
TO ALGIERS WHO APPEARS WELL-CONNECTED WITHIN 
SANAA, POSSIBLY SIGNIFYING IMPROVING 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  ALGERIA HAS 
COORDINATED TO A SMALL EXTENT ITS RESPONSES WITH 
NORTH YEMEN ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FALL OF 
ALI NASIR. 
 
--------------- 
THE ARAB LEAGUE 
--------------- 
18. FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS ALGERIA HAS VIEWED THE 
ARAB LEAGUE AS A NEARLY MORIBUND, INCREASINGLY 
IRRELEVANT ORGANIZATION, REFLECTIVE OF THE 
DISARRAY IN THE ARAB WORLD.  APPARENTLY,THOUGH, 
WITHIN THE PAST TWO MONTHS THE GOA HAS SEIZED UPON 
THE LEAGUE AS A POTENTIAL VEHICLE FOR RENEWING/ 
REVITALIZING ARAB UNITY.  TO THIS END THE GOA HAS 
SENT EMISSARIES TO DAMASCUS (MESSAADIA), SAUDI 
ARABIA (IBRAHIMI) AND BEIRUT (BESSAIH/ZOUATEN) 
TO LOBBY FOR THE NECESSITY OF A SUMMIT, OPTIMISTICALLY 
IN DECEMBER.  THE GOA HAS ALSO USED THE ARAB 
LEAGUE TO REINFORCE ITS CREDIBILITY WITH IRAN 
BY OPPOSING ANTI-IRANIAN RESOLUTIONS ON THE GULF 
WAR.  HOWEVER, ALGERIA HAS BEEN LESS SUCCESSFUL 
IN GAINING ARAB SUPPORT ON THE WESTERN SAHARA 
ISSUE, AND THIS HAS HINDERED ALGERIAN EFFORTS TO 
GAIN SDAR ADMISSION INTO THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT 
(NAM).  FURTHERMORE, THE GOA HAS BEEN UNHAPPY WITH 
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEAGUE AND HAS WORKED 
TO BOTH STREAMLINE AND IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS 
AT THE LEAGUE\'S HEADQUARTERS IN TUNIS. 
 
------------------ 
ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
------------------ 
19. OIL AND HYDROCARBON REVENUES ARE THE LIFEBLOOD 
OF THE ALGERIAN ECONOMY, AND THEREFORE DEVELOPMENTS 
AFFECTING OIL ARE CRITICAL TO ALGERIA\'S WELFARE. 
ALGERIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN HIGH PRICES WHILE 
PRESSURING MAJOR PRODUCERS TO ACCEPT \"REASONABLE\" 
PRODUCTION LEVELS, PARTICULARLY SAUDI ARABIA.  THIS 
PRESSURE HAS BEEN COORDINATED WITH LIBYA AND IRAN 
PRINCIPALLY, BUT RECENTLY THE GOA HAS TRIED TO 
FORM AN ASSOCIATION OF AFRICAN PRODUCERS FOR A 
SIMILAR OBJECTIVE.  AS PRICES HAVE STABILIZED 
SINCE AUGUST, ALGERIA HAS TAKEN SOME SATISFACTION 
FROM ITS EFFORTS, EVEN IF IN REALITY THEY HAD ONLY 
A MARGINAL IMPACT ON OPEC DECISIONS.  BESIDES OIL, 
THERE IS VERY LITTLE TRADE BY ALGERIA WITHIN THE 
ARAB MARKET, AND ONLY A BARELY MORE SIGNIFICANT 
MONETARY INTEREST BY ARAB BANKS AND FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE ARAB DEVELOPMENT BANK 
AND THE SAUDI DEVELOPMENT BANK.  WE BELIEVE LOANS 
FROM THESE SOURCES WERE LESS THAN $100 MILLION, 
REPRESENTING A DECLINE FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. 
THUS, AS THE OIL MARKET GOES, SO GO ALGERIA\'S 
TRADE RELATIONS IN THE ARAB WORLD, HAVING SOME 
REPERCUSSIONS FOR ITS POLITICAL RELATIONS. 
 
---------------------- 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM 
---------------------- 
20. AS IN MOST ARAB COUNTRIES, ISLAM IS THE STATE 
RELIGION IN ALGERIA AND, AS SUCH, ENJOYS A 
PRIVILEGED POSITION VIS-A-VIS OTHER INSTITUTIONS. 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ATTEMPTED TO CO-OPT ISLAMIC 
PRECEPTS AND VALUES BY INCORPORATING THEM INTO 
THE NATIONAL CHARTER AND BY ENCOURAGING MOSQUE 
CONSTRUCTION AND PAYING AND TRAINING THE IMAMS. 
THERE IS ALSO SUBSTANTIAL ANNUAL SUPPORT FOR ALGERIAN 
PILGRIMS TO PERFORM THE HAJJ TO MECCA. 
HOWEVER, WHEN EXTERNAL INFLUENCES HAVE ATTEMPTED 
TO INVADE THE GOA\'S MONOPOLY ON ISLAM, IT REACTS 
VIGOROUSLY.  THE GOA WAS PARTICULARLY INCENSED 
BY LIBYAN EFFORTS IN 1983-84 TO FUND \"PRIVATE\" 
MOSQUES, WHICH THE GOA CORRECTLY VIEWED AS SOURCES 
OF FUNDAMENTALISM.  RUMORS OF SAUDI FINANCING TO 
ALGERIAN ISLAMISTS IN MID-1986 ALSO RAISED GOA 
SUSPICIONS ABOUT SAUDI INTENTIONS.  THE GOA CON- 
TINUES TO BE CONCERNED BY BEN BELLA\'S EFFORTS TO 
USE ISLAM TO RECRUIT ANTI-REGIME ELEMENTS.  TO 
COUNTER THESE ACTIVITIES, THE GOA HAS WORKED CLOSELY 
WITH THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT TO RECRUIT 
TRADITIONALLY ORIENTED ISLAMIC SCHOLARS TO STAFF 
ALGERIA\'S NEW UNIVERSITY OF ISLAMIC AND SCIENTIFIC 
STUDIES IN CONSTANTINE.  THE GOA ALSO TRIES TO 
CONTROL THE INFLOW OF ISLAMIC MATERIALS, SUCH AS 
RECORDED SERMONS AND LITERATURE, WITH ONLY 
MODERATE SUCCESS.  DESPITE RELATIVELY ACTIVE 
CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE EFFECTS 
OF FUNDAMENTALISM, THE GOA DOES NOT APPEAR TO 
COORDINATE ITS RESPONSES WITH ITS MAGHREB NEIGHBORS. 
FOR ALGERIA, FUNDAMENTALISM REMAINS MORE OF A LONG- 
TERM POTENTIAL PROBLEM RATHER THAN AN IMMEDIATE 
THREAT, AND AS SUCH IS USUALLY NOT ON ALGERIA\'S 
AGENDA IN ITS BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH MOST 
ARAB COUNTRIES. 
 
------------------------- 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S. 
------------------------- 
 
21. MUTUAL U.S.-ALGERIAN EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR 
BILATERAL RELATIONS HAVE HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON 
ALGERIA\'S APPROACH ON NUMEROUS ARAB-RELATED 
ISSUES.  DESPITE OUR DISAGREEMENT OVER TACTICS, 
OUR SHARED DISTRUST OF QADHAFI HAS ALLOWED US TO 
MAINTAIN A USEFUL DIALOGUE WITH THE GOA ON LIBYA. 
SIMILARLY, ALGERIA HAS ADOPTED A CONSTRUCTIVE, 
NON-AGGRESSIVE POSTURE TOWARD TUNISIA TO CONTRIBUTE 
TO A STABLE TRANSITION THERE.  ALGERIAN REACTIONS 
WERE RELATIVELY MUTED TO THE U.S. RAID ON 
TRIPOLI (APRIL 15), AND, AFTER A BRIEF PAUSE, 
THERE WAS AN UPSURGE IN BILATERAL COOPERATION 
ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM, INCLUDING MILITARY AND 
SECURITY INTERESTS.  FOREIGN MINISTRY SECGEN HAMDANI 
EXPLAINED TO US THAT ALGERIAN EFFORTS TO HAVE THE 
PLO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE 
THE PLO TO RESPOND TO PEACE INITIATIVES IN A MORE 
POSITIVE MANNER.  THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN 
COOPERATIVE EFFORTS MADE TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE 
OF U.S. HOSTAGES IN LEBANON, AIDED BY ALGERIA\'S 
ACCESS TO THOSE RADICAL GROUPS HOLDING THE AMERICANS. 
FINALLY, THE GOA HAS RECENTLY TAKEN STEPS TO 
COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. ON COUNTERING TERRORISM. 
 
 
22. THESE CONCRETE ACTIONS BY THE GOA TO WORK WITH 
THE U.S. ON ARAB-RELATED ISSUES THAT AFFECT OUR 
INTERESTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED TOO IN ALGERIA\'S 
RHETORICAL PUBLIC APPROACH, WITH A LOWERING OF 
DIRECT CRITICISM, EVEN WHILE VOTING AGAINST U.S. 
POSITIONS IN INTERNATIONAL FORA.  THE GOA LEADERSHIP 
HAS BEEN WILLING TO PAY A DOMESTIC PRICE FOR THIS 
POLICY, DEFLECTING CRITICISM BY INTERNAL HARDLINERS 
AND MOVING FORWARD, ALBEIT GRADUALLY, WITH A VARIETY 
OF BILATERAL PROGRAMS.  ACTIVE U.S. SUPPORT FOR 
ISRAEL, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT TOUCHES UPON NORTH 
AFRICA, AS IT DID IN THE OCTOBER 1985 ISRAELI 
BOMBING OF PLO HEADQUARTERS IN TUNIS, WILL GIVE 
THE GOA SERIOUS INTERNAL DIFFICULTIES IN WORKING 
TOWARD BROADLY DEEPER COOPERATION ON ARAB-RELATED 
ISSUES.  HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE A GROWING CAPACITY 
TO SEPARATE ISRAELI ACTIONS FROM U.S. POLICIES, 
AS APPEARS TO BE THE CASE WITH ALGERIAN ACCUSATIONS 
OF ISRAELI INVOLVEMENT IN MOROCCO.  IF THIS TREND 
CONTINUES, IT MIGHT BE A STRONG INDICATION 
THAT OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP HAS TAKEN ON AN 
IMPORTANCE WHICH COULD TRANSCEND PREVIOUS ALGERIAN 
CONVICTIONS THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF ARAB SOLIDARITY 
WAS THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IN ITS 
POLICY FORMULATION.  IN ANY CASE, IT IS CLEAR 
THAT ALGERIA NOW INCLUDES POTENTIAL U.S. 
REACTIONS AS PART OF ITS POLICY DELIBERATIONS AND 
FREQUENTLY GIVES THESE REACTIONS CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT 
IN ITS DECISION-MAKING.  THIS WILL CONTINUE TO 
PROVIDE THE U.S. WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK 
CLOSELY WITH THE GOA TO ADVANCE OUR INTERESTS IN 
THE ARAB WORLD.

SUBJECT:  ALGERIA AND THE PLO 
 
REF:  KPRP 28 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  ALGERIA HAS LONG BEEN AN ACTIVE-- 
IF DISTANT--PARTICIPANT IN MIDDLE EAST DIPLOMACY. 
ENGAGEMENT ARISES FROM ALGERIA\'S SELF-PERCEPTION 
AS ROLE MODEL FOR ALL NATIONAL LIBERATION STRUGGLES 
AND FROM STRONG EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
ARAB/ISLAMIC CAUSE.  POINT OF ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN 
THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, AND ALGERIA 
HAS CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO IMPART THE \"LESSONS 
LEARNED\" FROM ITS OWN STRUGGLE AGAINST COLONIALISM, 
URGING \"UNITY\" ON THE PALESTINIANS FIRST AND 
FOREMOST. 
 
3.  THE PLO HAS BEEN A SLOW LEARNER.  PALESTINIANS 
HAVE TRIED MIGHTILY TO IMPOSE \"UNITY,\" BUT HAVE 
LACKED THE RESOURCES AND REACH THAT THE FLN HAD 
IN ITS WAR AGAINST FRANCE.  ALGERIA, NONETHELESS, 
HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT ALLY FOR THE PLO, AND THE 
PALESTINIANS HAVE DERIVED BENEFIT FROM THE GOA\'S 
WIDELY VALUED DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.  ALGIERS HAS ALSO 
SERVED AS A USEFUL VENUE FOR A NUMBER OF PLO ACTI- 
VITIES, MAINLY TRAINING AND LARGE CONGRESSES--SUCH 
AS THE PNC SLATED FOR APRIL 20. 
 
4.  ALGERIA, FOR ITS PART, HAS COMPLETED A LONG 
JOURNEY FROM THE REJECTIONIST/STEADFASTNESS FRONT 
APPROACH TO THE MIDDLE EAST DISPUTE, BUT IT STILL 
VIEWS THE CAMP DAVID APPROACH AS A SELLOUT OF 
ESSENTIAL PALESTINIAN INTERESTS.  BUT, WHILE 
CHAMPIONING THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE, ALGERIA HAS 
LEFT UNCLEAR WHAT IT THINKS THE VIABLE SOLUTION 
TO THE ARAB-ISRAEL DISPUTE COULD BE.  THE GOA REJECTS 
\"TERROR\" AS A TACTIC, BUT STILL REGARDS  ACTS OF 
VIOLENCE \"IN THE TERRITORY TO BE LIBERATED\" AS 
ACCEPTABLE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------- 
TO PNC OR NOT TO PNC 
-------------------- 
 
5.  ALGERIA IS PLANNING TO HOST THE PALESTINE 
NATIONAL CONGRESS ON APRIL 20 AFTER A PREPARATORY 
MEETING STARTING APRIL 13.  THESE MEETINGS ARE THE 
RESULT OF MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF INTRICATE, CONFUSING, 
AND OFTEN FRUSTRATING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS AND PRO- 
TRACTED NEGOTIATIONS WITH NUMEROUS PALESTINIAN FACTIONS 
AND OTHER ARAB STATES.  WHILE ALGERIA WILL BE PLEASED 
IF THERE IS A SUCCESSFUL PNC, THE LONG-TERM GOAL 
REMAINS PUTTING TOGETHER A MORE LASTING UNITY THAT 
WILL ALLOW THE PLO TO PARTICIPATE COHESIVELY IN AN 
ARAB SUMMIT, AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE 
MIDDLE EAST, AND EVENTUAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL. 
ALGERIA\'S DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS HAVE SOUGHT TO COMPOSE 
INTERNAL PALESTINIAN DIFFERENCES, INDUCE SYRIA TO 
PUT ASIDE ITS PAROCHIAL OBJECTIVES AND DISLIKE FOR 
YASSIR ARAFAT, AND SOLICIT SOVIET SUPPORT FOR UNITY 
UNDER ARAFAT.  AT THE SAME TIME, ALGERIA HAS ALSO 
BEEN CAREFUL TO HOLD OUT A GLIMMER OF HOPE THAT 
EGYPT CAN REJOIN THE ARAB COMMUNITY WITHOUT 
ABANDONMENT OF ITS ESSENTIAL INTERESTS.  WITH THESE 
FACTORS TO DEAL WITH, IT WILL BE NO SMALL FEAT IF 
THE PNC ACTUALLY CONVENES APRIL 20. 
 
--------------- 
HISTORY LESSONS 
--------------- 
 
6.  THE ALGERIANS CONSIDER THEIR WARTIME EXPERIENCE 
A MODEL FOR LIBERATION MOVEMENTS AND FOR THE PLO 
IN PARTICULAR.  FOR THE ALGERIANS, MAINTAINING 
REVOLUTIONARY UNITY UNDER THE FLN UMBRELLA PREVENTED 
BOTH THE FRENCH AND OTHER ARAB STATES FROM EXPLOITING 
PUBLIC CLEAVAGES TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.  ONCE THE ALGERIANS 
MADE IT CLEAR THAT FRANCE COULD HOLD ON NO LONGER IN 
NORTH AFRICA, THE FLN ATTAINED VIRTUALLY ALL OF ITS 
OBJECTIVES.  IN URGING THESE LESSONS ON THE PALESTINIANS, 
HOWEVER, THE ALGERIANS OVERLOOK ONE KEY FACTOR:  THEIR 
UNITY WAS THE RESULT OF RUTHLESS LIQUIDATION OF ANY 
ELEMENT THOUGHT RECALCITRANT OR INCONVENIENT, FROM 
HARKIS WHO FOUGHT WITH FRANCE TO COMMUNISTS WHO JOINED 
THE STRUGGLE FOR ANTI-NATIONALIST GOALS.  TRY AS THEY 
MIGHT, THE PALESTINIANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE 
UNITY ON THIS BASIS. 
 
7.  IN DEALING WITH THE PLO, THE ALGERIANS HAVE 
TRIED--WITH VARYING SUCCESS--TO CONVEY A FOUR-PART 
MESSAGE TO THEIR PALESTINIAN FRIENDS: 
 
A)  ALGERIA IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO ADVISE MOVEMENTS 
    ENGAGED IN \"NATIONAL LIBERATION\" STRUGGLES. 
 
B)  A KEY ELEMENT OF SUCCESS IS CONCEALING INTERNAL 
    DISPUTES BEHIND A FACADE OF UNITY. 
 
C)  NO OUTSIDE POWER CAN BE ALLOWED TO DICTATE GOALS, 
    LEADERSHIP, AND STRATEGY.  THE PALESTINIANS, IN 
    CONTRAST TO THE FLN, HAVE SPLINTERED INTO FACTIONS 
    IDENTIFIED CLOSELY WITH ARAB STATES THAT HAVE 
    SACRIFICED PALESTINIAN INTERESTS FOR THE SAKE 
    OF THEIR OWN PAROCHIAL OBJECTIVES. 
 
D)  ALGERIA HAS MAINTAINED CONTACT WITH ALL PALESTINIAN 
    GROUPS FROM THE MAIN-LINE FATAH TO THE EXTREME 
    ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION AND HAS INSISTED THAT 
    UNIFICATION OF ALL FACTIONS, WHATEVER THEIR 
    IDEOLOGY, IS THE ONLY WAY TO ADVANCE THE 
    PALESTINIAN CAUSE. 
 
------------------------------- 
MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT 
------------------------------- 
 
8.  IN ADDITION TO LESSONS ON HOW TO ORGANIZE A 
REVOLUTIONARY WAR, ALGERIA HAS FURNISHED THE PLO 
MORE TANGIBLE MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT. 
AS OF LATE MARCH 1987, ABOUT 600 PALESTINIAN COMBATANTS 
WERE LOCATED WITH THE ALGERIAN MILITARY AT EL-BAYADH, 
A REMOTE SITE ABOUT 600 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST OF THE 
CAPITAL.  THESE COMBATANTS, WHO ARE REPORTEDLY UNHAPPY 
WITH THEIR LOT IN THE REMOTE DESERT LOCATION, HAD 
MOVED TO EL-BAYADH IN LATE 1986 FROM A CAMP AT 
TEBESSA, NEAR THE TUNISIA FRONTIER. 
 
9.  ALGERIA ALSO HOSTS AN OFFICIAL PLO EMBASSY, LED 
BY AN ARAFAT SUPPORTER, AND SMALL LIAISON OFFICES 
FOR SOME OF THE PLO FACTIONS.  ON THE POLITICAL LEVEL, 
THE ALGERIANS HAVE, SINCE THE DEATH OF THE FOREIGN 
MINISTER BENYAHIA IN 1982, DEALT PUBLICLY WITH THE 
PLO THROUGH THE APPARATUS OF THE RULING PARTY (FLN). 
THE PLO WORKS WITH THE ALGERIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY ON 
ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS, WITH THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 
ON MILITARY TRAINING, AND WITH THE FLN ON MATTERS 
OF POLICY.  THE MAIN FIGURES WITHIN THE FLN WHO DEAL 
WITH ALGERIAN-PLO RELATIONS ARE MOHAMMED CHERIF 
MESSAADIA, HEAD OF THE PERMANENT SECRETARIAT OF THE 
FLN CENTRAL COMMITTEE, AND HIS CLOSE ASSOCIATE, SADEK 
ZOUATEN, CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY COUNCIL OF FRIENDSHIP 
WITH PEOPLES. 
 
------------------------- 
CATCHING FLIES WITH HONEY 
------------------------- 
 
10.  ZOUATEN AND MESSAADIA TAKE CARE OF VISITING 
PALESTINIAN DELEGATIONS, BUT PRESIDENT BENDJEDID 
ALSO ENGAGES HIMSELF PERSONALLY, RECEIVING MOST 
PALESTINIAN DELEGATIONS, AND HIS POSITION AS FLN 
SECRETARY-GENERAL ALLOWS THE ALGERIANS TO PRESERVE 
THE FORMS OF PARTY-TO-PARTY RELATIONS.  THE ALGERIANS 
CAREFULLY BALANCE THEIR PROTOCOL TREATMENT OF THE 
VARIOUS GROUPS, ENSURING THAT NONE IS SEEN AS FAVORED. 
WHEN GEORGE HABBASH AND THE PFLP, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE 
AT THEIR MOST INTRANSIGENT ON THEIR CONDITIONS FOR 
ATTENDING ANY REUNIFICATION CONFERENCE, THE ALGERIANS 
BECOME EVEN WARMER AND MORE WELCOMING IN THEIR PUBLIC 
TREATMENT OF HABBASH, SEEKING TO WIN HIM OVER TO WHAT 
IS THE ESSENTIALLY PRO-FATAH VIEW OF THE GOA. 
 
11.  WHILE AVOIDING A PUBLIC BREAK WITH ANY PLO 
FACTION, THE ALGERIANS HAVE ALSO APPLIED DISCREET 
PRESSURE ON ALL GROUPS TO PUT REUNIFICATION ABOVE 
PERSONAL AND FACTIONAL INTERESTS.  PART OF THIS 
PRESSURE IS TO INSTILL AND EXPLOIT A SENSE OF SHAME 
AND PERSONAL OBLIGATION.  BENDJEDID HAS STAKED 
CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL CAPITAL ON HIS REUNIFICATION 
INITIATIVE, AND NO PALESTINIAN GROUP WANTS OPENLY 
TO DEFY THE PRESIDENT\'S CALLS FOR UNITY AND BEAR 
THE BLAME FOR THE FAILURE OF HIS EFFORTS. 
 
12.  THE ALGERIANS HAVE ALSO TRIED TO PRESSURE SPECIFIC 
INDIVIDUALS WHO THEY BELIEVE ARE OBSTRUCTING UNITY 
EFFORTS.  IN FEBRUARY 1987, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ALGERIANS 
APPARENTLY GAVE ARAFAT COLD TREATMENT FOR OPPOSING A 
UNITY PLATFORM DURING AN ALGIERS PALESTINIAN WRITERS 
AND JOURNALISTS CONFERENCE.  IN ORDER TO BRING GEORGE 
HABBASH AND THE PFLP INTO THE UNIFICATION TALKS, 
ALGERIA HAS TRIED TO USE WHAT INFLUENCE IT HAS ON 
THAT FACTION\'S SYRIAN BACKERS.  WITH THIS GOAL IN 
MIND, ALGERIA HAS TAKEN A NOTABLY PRO-SYRIAN PUBLIC 
STAND SINCE BENDJEDID\'S JANUARY 23 VISIT TO DAMASCUS 
AND SINCE THE KUWAIT ISLAMIC CONFERENCE SUMMIT.  IN 
SO DOING, ALGIERS HAS HAD TO SWALLOW HARD AND MAINTAIN 
PUBLIC SILENCE OVER SYRIA\'S SUPPORT FOR THE AMAL 
MILITIA IN THE LEBANON CAMPS WAR. 
 
--------------------------------- 
TERRORISM VS. NATIONAL LIBERATION 
--------------------------------- 
 
13.  ALGERIA RECOGNIZES THE TERRIBLE DAMAGE THAT 
TERRORISM DOES TO THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE WITH WESTERN 
PUBLIC OPINION.  YET, DRAWING FROM THEIR OWN STRUGGLE 
AGAINST THE FRENCH, THE ALGERIANS FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT 
USE OF VIOLENCE IS A LEGITIMATE TACTIC AGAINST A 
COLONIZER WHO SHOWS NO SIGN OF GIVING IN TO THE DEMANDS 
OF A \"COLONIZED PEOPLE.\"  ALGERIANS FEEL THE DILEMMA 
ACUTELY--BOTH ON A PHILOSOPHICAL AND A TACTICAL LEVEL-- 
AND HAVE COME UP WITH A LINE OF ARGUMENT THAT CONDEMNS 
TERRORISM, BUT ACCEPTS THE MORAL AND TACTICAL VALIDITY 
OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE ON THE TERRITORY TO BE LIBERATED. 
THIS ALLOWS THE GOA TO BE CRITICAL OF TOTALLY REPRE- 
HENSIBLE ACTIONS LIKE RANDOM ATTACKS AT EUROPEAN 
AIRPORTS ON INNOCENT PASSENGERS AND THE ACHILLE LAURO 
AFFAIR, BUT PRESUMABLY LEAVES A DOOR OPEN TO ATTACKS 
ON ISRAEL DIRECTLY.  FOR FEAR OF TYING THEMSELVES 
DOWN OR PREJUDGING ISSUES ON WHICH THE PALESTINIANS 
CANNOT THEMSELVES AGREE, THE ALGERIANS ARE PURPOSE- 
FULLY VAGUE ABOUT WHAT TERRITORY IS TO BE LIBERATED-- 
THE WEST BANK AND GAZA OR ISRAEL ITSELF. 
 
14.  BEYOND THE PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUE, THE ALGERIANS 
FACE MORE PRACTICAL DILEMMAS IN HOW TO DEAL WITH THE 
PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ENGAGE IN TERRORISM. 
THE ACHILLE LAURO DISASTER WAS EASY TO CRITICIZE, 
BUT THEY STILL CONSIDER ABU ABBAS AN IMPORTANT PALES- 
TINIAN LEADER WHO MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN UNITY 
GFFORTS.  THEY CONSIDER ABU NIDAL BEYOND THE PALE, 
A JUDGMENT MADE EASIER BY THE FATAH DEATH SENTENCE 
AGAINST HIM, BUT THE GOA NONETHELESS IS NOT OVERTLY 
HOSTILE TO ABU NIDAL AND PERMITS AT LEAST TWO PALES- 
TINIAN STUDENTS LOYAL TO HIM TO LIVE IN ALGIERS. 
 
15.  WHATEVER THE GOA\'S VIEWS ON THE UTILITY OF 
TERRORISM, ALGERIA\'S BROAD POLICY OF KEEPING DOORS 
OPEN TO EVERY CONCEIVABLE \"NATIONAL LIBERATION\" 
MOVEMENT OVERRIDES MOST OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.  THE 
GOA SEES ITSELF AS THE WORLD\'S MIDDLEMAN AND RECOG- 
NIZES THAT TO DEAL WITH ALL PARTIES TO DISPUTES, IT 
MUST BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH THEM.  AT A TIME WHEN 
NO OTHER COUNTRY COULD HAVE ACHIEVED WHAT ALGERIA 
HAS WITH THE PLO UNITY EFFORT THUS FAR, AN ARGUMENT 
CAN BE MADE IN FAVOR OF THAT OPENNESS. 
 
------------------------------------- 
WILL THE REAL ALGERIA PLEASE STAND UP 
------------------------------------- 
 
16.  ALGERIA HAS COME A LONG WAY FROM THE DAYS IT 
FORMED THE REJECTIONIST/STEADFASTNESS FRONT WITH THE 
LIKES OF SYRIA, SOUTH YEMEN, AND LIBYA.  WHILE ITS 
VIEWS ON THE ARAB-ISRAEL DISPUTE HAVE CHANGED 
RADICALLY AND ITS WILLINGNESS TO HAVE ITS NAME 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRUE HARDLINERS IS NON-EXISTENT, 
THE GOA HAS BECOME VAGUE ON HOW IT THINKS PEACE CAN 
BE FOUND IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  THE CAMP DAVID ACCORDS 
AND GESTURES LIKE HASSAN\'S MEETINB WITH PERES AT 
IFRANE ARE STILL ROUNDLY CRITICIZED IN THE ALGERIAN 
PRESS.  YET, THE ALGERIANS WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY 
NOT TO CRITICIZE THE HUSSEIN/ARAFAT ACCORDS WHEN 
THEY SHOWED PROMISE OF WORKING, AND THEY HAVE MADE 
SOME OVERTURES TO EGYPT, INDICATING THAT THE EGYPTIANS 
CAN EVENTUALLY MAKE THEIR WAY BACK INTO THE ARAB 
COMMUNITY ON THEIR OWN TERMS. 
 
17.  SO FAR THE ALGERIANS HAVE CAREFULLY AVOIDED 
INVOLVEMENT IN DETAILS OF THE COMPLEX NEGOTIATIONS 
LEADING TO THE PNC MEETING.  WHATEVER THEIR PRIVATE 
FEELINGS ABOUT SPECIFIC ISSUES, THEY HAVE TAKEN NO 
PUBLIC STAND ON THE ABROGATION OF THE AMMAN ACCORD, 
ON PLO TIES WITH EGYPT, ON THE ORGANIZATION OF PLO 
LEADERSHIP, OR ON OTHER DIVISIVE QUESTIONS.  DRAWING 
ON THEIR OWN REVOLUTIONARY EXPERIENCE, THE ALGERIANS 
HAVE SAID ONLY THAT THE PALESTINIANS THEMSELVES MUST 
DECIDE THESE QUESTIONS WITHOUT OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE 
AND THAT PERSONALITIES, EVEN YASIR ARAFAT\'S, SHOULD 
NOT BECOME AN ISSUE THAT OBSCURES REVOLUTIONARY GOALS. 
 
--------- 
PROSPECTS 
--------- 
 
18.  THE SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS FOR ALGERIA AND THE PLO 
RAISE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS: 
 
A)  CAN ALGERIA HOST A PNC MEETING IN APRIL AS PLANNED 
    DESPITE FACTIONAL DISPUTES AMONG THE PALESTINIANS? 
 
B)  IF SO, WILL THE PNC INCLUDE ALL FACTIONS OR WILL 
    IT BE A RUMP SESSION WITHOUT PFLP AND OTHER 
    PRO-SYRIAN PARTICIPATION?  FOR THE ALGERIANS, 
    THE LATTER WOULD REPRESENT ALMOST AS SERIOUS A 
    DIPLOMATIC SETBACK AS A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN OF 
    THE MEETING. 
 
C)  WILL THE PNC MEETING ACHIEVE SOME SORT OF UNITY 
    OR WILL IT BE ANOTHER FORUM FOR COMPETING GROUPS 
    AND PERSONALITIES TO AIR THEIR DISPUTES IN PUBLIC? 
 
D)  GIVEN THE COMPETING INFLUENCES AT WORK AMONG THE 
    PALESTINIANS, WHAT WILL BE THE LIFE SPAN OF ANY 
    AGREEMENT REACHED AT THE NEXT PNC? 
 
19.  WHILE ALGERIA RETAINS ITS SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVE 
OF BRINGING ALL PALESTINIAN FACTIONS TO ALGIERS IN 
LATE APRIL, ITS LONG-TERM GOAL REMAINS RESTORING A 
PLO THAT CAN PRESENT A FACADE OF UNITY, SPEAK WITH 
ONE VOICE ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES OF PALESTINIAN 
NATIONALISM, AND ATTEND AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE 
AS A COHESIVE GROUP.  AT THE SAME TIME, ALGERIA 
WILL TRY TO MAINTAIN ITS POSITION AS MEDIATOR AND 
DISINTERESTED FRIEND AND TEACHER TO ALL PALESTINIAN 
FACTIONS--A TEACHER WHOSE PRESTIGE AND EXPERIENCE 
SHOULD GUIDE RELUCTANT AND REBELLIOUS STUDENTS ON 
THE CORRECT REVOLUTIONARY PATH.  IF ONLY THEY WOULD 
LISTEN.

2.  RELATIONS WITH THE PALESTINE LIBERATION

THERE HAS BEEN A PLO OFFICE IN ALGIERS SINCE THAT 
ORGANIZATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1964.  THE ALGERIAN 
DIPLOMATIC LIST SHOWS EIGHT EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING 
A REPRESENTATIVE, TWO DEPUTY REPRESENTATIVES, A 
MILITARY ATTACHE, AND FOUR FIRST SECRETARIES. 
THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE FULL DIPLOMATIC STATUS. 
 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF THE MATTER, 
ALGERIA PROVIDES FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE PLO 
OFFICE HERE AND PROVIDES FACILITIES FOR CONFERENCES 
SUCH AS THE PALESTINE NATIONAL CONGRESS (LAST HELD 
IN APRIL 1987) AND THE CONFERENCE OF PALESTINIAN 
WRITERS AND JOURNALISTS (LAST HELD IN FEB 1987). 
WHEN MAJOR PALESTINIAN FIGURES ARE IN ALGERIA, 
THEY ARE REPORTEDLY GUESTS OF THE ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
ALGERIA CONDUCTS MOST OF HER RELATIONS WITH THE PLO 
ON A PARTY-TO-PARTY BASIS, SPECIFICALLY THROUGH 
THE COMMITTEE FOR FRIENDSHIP AND SOLIDARITY AMONG 
PEOPLES, OF THE RULING NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT. 
 
3.  THERE IS FURTHER REPORTING ON OTHER FORMS OF

1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE D\'AFFAIRES JOSEPH 
STAFFORD, AMEMBASSY ALGIERS, REASON 1.5 (D). 
 
2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF NEARLY 
FIVE YEARS OF SUSTAINED VIOLENCE HERE, NOVEMBER 1996 
HAS WITNESSED SOME PARTICULRLY GRUESOME TERRORIST 
ATROCITIES, ESPECIALLY INCENTRAL ALGERIA.  RATHER 
THAN TRYING TO PREVENT EWSPAPERS FROM PUBLISHING 
STORIES ABOUT THE ATROITIES, THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS 
TO BE ENCOURAGING HEM TO DO SO.  THESE LATEST 
ATTACKS HAVE AGGRAVATD PUBLIC WORRIES ABOUT THE 
SECURITY SITUATION, EPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINOUS 
REGIONS OUTSIDE ALGIRS.  WE SENSE, HOWEVER, LITTLE 
CHANGE IN CITIZEN\' DAILY ROUTINE IN ALGIERS OR EVEN 
THE NEARBY BLDA REGION, SCENE OF SEVERAL OF THE 
RECENT INCIDENS.  THIS LATEST UPTURN IN VIOLENCE 
HAS NOT YET PROVIDED CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF NEW 
CAPABILITIES ON THE PART OF EXTREMIST ELEMENTS, NOR 
OF A GREATER THREAT TO REGIME STABILITY.  AT THIS 
POINT, WE SEE NO/NO REASON TO REVISE OUR ASSESSMENT 
THAT THE GOA IS MAKING PROGRESS IN REDUCING THE 
INSURGENCY THREAT -- BUT LESS PROGRESS IN REDUCING 
TERRORISM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (U)  TERRORIST INCIDENTS AGAINST CIVILIANS 
REMAIN FREQUENT IN ALGERIA, BUT NOVEMBER 1996 
APPEARS TO BE A PARTICULARLY HORRIFIC MONTH. 
MURDERS OF CIVILIANS APPEAR TO HAVE INCREASED FROM 
THE LEVELS EARLIER IN THE AUTUMN.  THE LIST OF 
RECENT ATTACKS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO: 
 
-- THE NOVEMBER 5 MASSACRE OF 13 CIVILIANS IN 
DAOUDA, IN TIPAZA WILAYA; 
 
-- THE NOVEMBER 7 BOMBING IN A VILLAGE NEAR TLEMCEN, 
IN WESTERN ALGERIA, WHICH KILLED FIVE, INCLUDING THE 
VILLAGE MAYOR; 
 
--  THE NOVEMBER 8 SLAUGHTER OF 31 PERSONS IN SIDI 
EL KEBIR VILLAGE, OUTSIDE OF BLIDA; 
 
--  THE NOVEMBER 10 BOMBING IN BIR KHADEM, OUTSIDE 
OF ALGIERS, WHICH KILLED SEVEN (INCLUDING THE SISTER 
OF AN EMBASSY FSN EMPLOYEE); 
 
--  THE NOVEMBER 12 ATTACK WHICH KILLED 14 PERSONS 
NEAR OUED ALLEUG, IN BLIDA WILAYA; 
 
--  THE NOVEMBER 13 KILLINGS OF 29 PERSONS IN TWO 
INCIDENTS IN MEDEA WILAYA; 
 
--  THE NOVEMBER 15 MURDER OF A BULGARIAN CITIZEN IN 
ALGIERS. 
 
4.  (C)  FROM WHAT LITTLE WE CAN PICK EJFROM OUR 
CONTACTS, THE RECENT SPATE OF INCIDENTS HAS 
AGGRAVATED THE WORRIES OF MANY, ESPECIALLY IN THE 
MOUNTAINS OUTSIDE OF ALGIERS, ABOUT SECURITY.  IN 
SOME CASES, THESE INCIDENTS STIRRED VILLAGES TO 
HASTEN CREATION OF LOCAL MILITIAS.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MASSACRE AT SIDI EL KEBIR, 
THE GOVERNMENT DISTRIBUTED ARMS TO VILLAGERS WHO 
SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED TWO ALLEGED TERRORISTS, 
ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS.  AN ALGERIAN WHO LIVES 
IN A VILLAGE NEAR THE JUNCTIONS OF BLIDA, TIPAZA AND 
ALGIERS WILAYAS TOLD POLOFF NOVEMBER 12 THAT MANY IN 
HIS COMMUNITY FEAR AN ATTACK BY ARMED ISLAMISTS; HE 
PREDICTED IT WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME.  IN 
RESPONSE, THE VILLAGE HAS ASKED THE LOCAL MILITARY 
AUTHORITIES FOR ARMS WITH WHICH TO ESTABLISH A 
\"SELF-PROTECTION\" FORCE (SO FAR, AUTHORITIES HAVE 
DECLINED TO SUPPLY WEAPONS). 
 
5.  (C)  IN SOME CASES FAMILIES HAVE TAKEN FLIGHT. 
A JOURNALIST WITH THE AVOWEDLY ANTI-ISLAMIST 
NEWSPAPER LIBERTE TOLD US THAT ONE OF THEIR 
REPORTERS SAW IN BLIDA ON NOVEMBER 18 HUNDREDS OF 
PERSONS WHO HAD FLED THEIR HOMES IN REMOTE MOUNTAIN 
LOCALES OUTSIDE OF THE CITY AND TAKEN REFUGE IN 
DOWNTOWN BLIDA (ITSELF NOT THE SAFEST PLACE).  THE 
REPORTER SAID THAT SEVERAL OF THESE PEOPLE TOLD HIM 
THE ARMED GROUPS OPERATING IN THE MOUNTAINS HAVE 
VOWED TO COMMIT MORE MASSACRES.  (ACCORDING TO PRESS 
REPORTS, THE BAND WHICH COMMITED THE NOVEMBER 12 
MURDERS AT OUED ALLEUG LEFT A NOTE SIGNED BY THE 
ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP (GIA) AND CONCLUDING WITH THE 
EXPRESSION, \"BLOOD, BLOOD, DESTRUCTION, 
DESTRUCTION.\") 
 
6.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT HAS CHANGED ITS MEDIA POLICY 
IN RESPONSE TO THESE TERRORIST INCIDENTS.  (IT HAD 
BEEN GENERALLY RESTRAINING NEWSPAPERS FROM 
PUBLISHING STORIES ABOUT THE SECURITY SITUATION.)  A 
JOURNALIST FROM AN ARABIC DAILY TOLD POLOFF NOVEMBER 
19 THAT THE INFORMATION MINISTRY CALLED HIS 
NEWSPAPER NOVEMBER 11 TO ASK WHY THE JOURNAL HAD NOT 
HIGHLIGHTED THE SIDI EL KEBIR MASSACRE WITH A STORY 
AND PHOTOS ON PAGE ONE LIKE OTHER NEWSPAPERS.  THIS 
SOURCE STATED THAT THE MINISTRY ENCOURAGED THE 
NEWSPAPER TO GIVE GREATER EMPHASIS TO TERRORIST 
ATTACKS; THE JOURNALIST COULDN\'T EXPLAIN EXACTLY 
WHY.  MEANWHILE, THE TELEVISION NEWS HAS REPORTED 
THE MANY INCIDENTS (AFTER THE DAILY TAKE OF STORIES 
ABOUT RALLIES IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
REFERENDUM).  AFTER THE SIDI EL KEBIR MASSACRE, THE 
TELEVISION EVEN RAN GRUESOME PICTURES OF BODIES, 
REMINISCENT OF BROADCASTS FROM 1994. 
 
7.  (C)  DESPITE THE SPATE OF RECENT INCIDENTS, WE 
DETECT LITTLE CHANGE FROM CITIZENS\' DAILY ROUTINE IN 
ALGIERS, ASIDE FROM A FEW EXTRA ROADBLOCKS.  A 
SENIOR JOURNALIST FROM THE ARABIC DAILY EL-KHABER 
STRESSED TO POLOFF NOVEMBER 18 THAT LIFE IN AND 
AROUND BLIDA APPEARS TO BE MORE OR LESS AS IT WAS 
EARLIER IN THE AUTUMN.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THE 
SPARKLING WATER PRODUCTION PLANT IN SIDI EL-KEBIR IS 
STILL OPERATING, FOR EXAMPLE.  THE AFP CORRESPONDENT 
HERE CAUTIONED POLOFF NOVEMBER 19 THAT SOME OF THE 
MOST PUBLICIZED RECENT INCIDENTS WERE HOUR-LONG 
ASSAULTS AGAINST A FEW HOMES; HE CONTRASTED THIS 
WITH 1993 AND 1994, WHEN LARGER GROUPS SOMETIMES 
OCCUPIED WHOLE VILLAGES FOR AN ENTIRE NIGHT, OR 
ATTACKED MILITARY CAMPS. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (C)  THIS SERIES OF TERRORIST ATTACKS DOES NOT 
CAUSE US TO CHANGE OUR ASSESSMENT IN REFTEL THAT THE 
GOA IS MAKING PROGRESS IN REDUCING THE INSURGENCY 
THREAT -- BUT LESS PROGRESS IN REDUCING TERRORISM. 
THE CENTRAL, MOUNTAINOUS WILAYAS OF BLIDA, TIPAZA, 
AND MEDEA, WHERE MOST OF THE RECENT INCIDENTS TOOK 
PLACE, HAVE LONG BEEN STRONGHOLDS OF ARMED 
ISLAMISTS.  EVEN THERE, WE DO NOT SEE CONCERTED 
ATTACKS AGAINST INFRASTRUCTURE, NOR ARE WE AWARE OF 
A SHARPLY HIGHER NUMBER OF MILITARY--AS OPPOSED TO 
CIVILIAN--DEATHS.  THUS, THE MANY INCIDENTS OF 
NOVEMBER 1996 DO NOT YET PROVIDE EVIDENCE EITHER 
THAT TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE GAINED SIGNIFICANT NEW 
CAPABILITIES WITH WHICH TO THREATEN, MUCH LESS 
TOPPLE, THE GOVERNMENT.  MOREOVER, GIVEN THE LONG 
SERIES OF UP AND DOWN CYCLES OF VIOLENCE HERE SINCE 
1992, THESE LATEST ATROCITIES DO NOT SIGNIFY THAT 
THE ALGERIAN MILITARY\'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE 
TERRORIST GROUPS HAS SUFFERED A SERIOUS REVERSE. 
RATHER, NOVEMBER 1996 SERVES TO REMIND THAT ENDING 
THE TERRORISM HERE WILL BE A LONG PROCESS AT BEST. 
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE RECENT INCIDENTS ARE 
DESIGNED, AT LEAST IN PART, TO DISSUADE CITIZENS 
FROM VENTURING FORTH TO VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER 28 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM.  IF SO, WE HAVE GOTTEN NO 
SENSE THAT THE EXTREMISTS\' INTIMIDATION CAMPAIGN IS 
HAVING MUCH IMPACT.

E.O. 12958:  DECL:  1/24/2007 
TAGS:  PGOV, KISL, AG 
SUBJECT:  ALGERIA\'S HAMAS PARTY:  A WINNING ORGANIZATION? 
 
REF:  ALGIERS 437 
 
1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN, 
AMEMBASSY ALGIERS, REASON 1.5 D. 
 
2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE FOCUS 
IN ISLAMIST POLITICS HERE HAS SHIFTED TO THE LEGAL 
ISLAMIC PARTY HAMAS (N0 RELATION TO PALESTINIAN 
HAMAS) AWAY FROM THE BANNED ISLAMIC SALVATI0N FRONT 
(FIS).  S0ME 0BSERVERS SUGGEST THAT WERE THE FIS 
ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THE SCENE, THE POPULAR BASE OF 
HAMAS WOULD VANISH (WE ARE SKEPTICAL).  HAMAS\' 
LEADER, MAHFOUD NAHNAH IS NOT AS GIFTED AN ORATOR AS 
SOME FIS LEADERS, AND HIS GRADUALIST APPROACH TO 
GAINING P0WER DIMINISHES HIS APPEAL AMONG HARDER 
LINE ISLAMISTS. 
 
3.  SUMMARY CONTINUED:  THE FIS, HOWEVER, NO LONGER 
EXISTS AS AN ORGANIZATI0N IN ALGERIA WHILE HAMAS HAS 
A RECENT NATIONAL 0RGANIZATION WITH EXPERIENCE FROM 
TW0 NATI0NAL ELECTI0NS BEHIND IT.  IN ADDITION, 
HAMAS HAS CL0SE TIES T0 NON-POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS 
AND CHARITY 0RGANIZATI0NS.  THE NEW GOVERNMENT LAW 
REGULATING PARTIES MAY LIMIT HAMAS\' LINKS WITH 
SUCH GROUPS.  STILL, HAMAS\' BIGGEST ORGANIZATIONAL 
WEAKNESS SEEMS TO BE NAHNAH\'S DOMINATION OF THE 
PARTY.  WERE HE SUDDENLY TO DEPART THE SCENE, A 
POWER VACUUM AT THE T0P COULD SERIOUSLY DISRUPT 
HAMAS--UNLIKE THE FIS IN 1991 WHEN ITS TOP 
LEADERSHIP WAS ARRESTED, BUT THE FIS WENT 0N TO WIN 
NATIONAL ELECTIONS NONETHELESS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
COMPETITION BETWEEN THE FIS AND HAMAS 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  HAMAS HAS GAINED PRESTIGE, AND VOTER 
STRENGTH, SINCE THE ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT WAS 
BANNED IN 1992, BUT SOME THINK HAMAS WOULD DISAPPEAR 
IF THE FIS WERE ALLOWED T0 RETURN.  DEDICATED FIS 
SYMPATHIZERS BLAME HAMAS PRESIDENT MAHFOUD NAHNAH 
FOR HAVING SPLIT THE ALGERIAN ISLAMIST MOVEMENT IN 
1990 (BY SETTING UP HAMAS).  IN ADDITION, 
HARDER-LINE ISLAMISTS REJECT NAHNAH\'S GRADUALIST 
APPROACH TO GAINING POWER; THEY ALSO ACCUSE NAHNAH 
OF COLLABORATING WITH THE G0VERNMENT (IN A WIDELY 
WATCHED FEBRUARY 21 MBC TELEVISION BROADCAST, A 
CALLER FR0M L0ND0N LABELLED NAHNAH A GOVERNMENT 
\'AGENT.\')  MORE0VER, NAHNAH HIMSELF DOES NOT HAVE 
THE CHARISMA 0F SOME FIS 0FFICIALS, NOTABLY JAILED 
VICE PRESIDENT ALI BENHADJ. 
 
INSIDE THE PARTY STRUCTURE 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  SHEIKH NAHNAH AND HIS HAMAS PARTY CARRY 
SOME BAGGAGE, BUT THEY HAVE A RELATIVELY ORDERLY 
PARTY WITH PARTICULAR STRENGTHS.  SHEIKH NAHNAH 
DOMINATES A PARTY VERY MUCH HIS CREATION; THERE IS 
LITTLE OF THE DISORDER SO APPARENT INSIDE THE FIS IN 
THE EARLY 1990\'S.  NAHNAH IS THE HEAD OF THE PARTY\'S 
\"EXECUTIVE C0UNCIL,\" (IN ARABIC, MAJLES ET-TANFITH), 
J0INED THERE BY NINE STAFFERS.  THOSE AIDES FOCUS ON 
DISTINCT FUNCTI0NS SUCH AS MEDIA RELATIONS, 
LEGISLATIVE WORK (HAMAS HAS FIVE MEMBERS IN THE 
SURROGATE PARLIAMENT), ISSUES DEVEL0PMENT AND 
INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION.  MOST MAJOR POLICY ISSUES 
ARE DEBATED WITHIN THIS \"EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.\"  A 
\"CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL\" (MAJLES ESH-SHOURA) SETS 
BROADER GUIDANCE, BUT ITS 100 PLUS MEMBERS, WHO COME 
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, MEET IRREGULARLY. 
 
WHICH MAINTAINS A MONOLITHIC FACE 
--------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  NOTABLY, HAMAS MAINTAINS ENOUGH ORDER 
WITHIN ITS SENIOR RANKS TO GUARD MANY SECRETS.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, VERY LITTLE OF THE INTERNAL DEBATE INSIDE 
THE EXECUTIVE C0UNCIL FILTERS OUTSIDE.  REPORTERS 
FROM THE ARABIC-LANGUAGE DAILIES EL-ALEM ES-SIYASI 
AND EL-KHABER, WHICH CARRY THE BEST REPORTING ON 
ISLAMISTS HERE, C0NFESS T0 HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY 
PUSHING THEIR HAMAS SOURCES PAST THE OFFICIAL LINE 
T0 DESCRIBE DEBATES INSIDE THE PARTY.  ITS OFFICIALS 
ARE SIMILARLY RETICENT WITH US. 
 
NOT ALL READILY AGREED INSIDE THE MACHINE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  WHILE KEPT QUIET, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME HOT 
POLITICAL ARGUMENTS INSIDE HAMAS.  NAHNAH\'S DECISION 
IN 1995 TO RUN F0R PRESIDENT WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
GUIDELINES PROMPTED TWO HAMAS MAJLES ASH-SHOURA 
MEMBERS TO QUIT THE PARTY.  ONE 0F THEM TOLD POLOFF 
FEBRUARY 23 THAT THE ARGUMENT INSIDE THE MAJLES 
F0CUSSED ON WHETHER HAMAS WAS HELPING THE GOVERNMENT 
BY JOINING THE 1995 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.  NAHNAH 
AND HIS ALLIES IN THE COUNCIL REPORTEDLY ARGUED THAT 
HAMAS COULD GAIN CONFIDENCE OF SENIOR GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS, AND PERHAPS EVEN SOME GOVERNMENT P0STS, 
IF THEY PLAYED THE PRESIDENCY\'S GAME. 
 
8.  (C)  THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER DISPUTES AS WELL. 
F0R EXAMPLE, ACCORDING T0 THE LOCAL PRESS AND 0NE 
HAMAS OFFICIAL, THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL\'S DECISION 
LAST NOVEMBER NOT TO URGE ALGERIANS TO VOTE AGAINST 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS, WHICH INCLUDED 
STRICTURES AGAINST MIXING RELIGION AND POLITICS, 
ALSO STIRRED CONTROVERSY.  SIMILARLY, ALGERIAN 
NEWSPAPERS THIS WEEK HAVE REPORTED THAT SOME IN THE 
HAMAS LEADERSHIP REJECT DELETING ISLAMIC REFERENCES 
FROM HAMAS\' NAME (HAMAS IS AN ACRONYM F0R \'MOVEMENT 
FOR AN ISLAMIC SOCIETY\') IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE 
NEW POLITICAL PARTY LAW.  THE PRESS HAS SPECULATED 
THAT WITH NAHNAH OUTSIDE OF ALGERIA--HE TRAVELS 
ABROAD FREQUENTLY--INTERNAL DEBATES INSIDE THE PARTY 
ARE DIFFICULT T0 SETTLE.  PUBLICLY, H0WEVER, HAMAS 
USUALLY PRESENTS A SINGLE PARTY LINE WHICH CONTRASTS 
TO THE SHARP PUBLIC DISCORD IN THE NATIONAL 
LIBERATION FR0NT AND THE SOCIALIST FORCES FRONT, FOR 
EXAMPLE. 
 
A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION 
----------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  HAMAS HAS A NATI0NAL POLITICAL 0RGANIZATION 
THE ENVY 0F M0ST 0THER ALGERIAN POLITICAL PARTIES. 
OUTSIDE ALGIERS, IT HAS 0FFICES WORKING THE STREETS 
0F NEARLY ALL 0F ALGERIA\'S 48 STATES (IN ALGERIAN 
VERNACULAR, WILAYAS), ACCORDING T0 BOTH PARTY 
OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL JOURNALISTS.  A SENIOR HAMAS 
OFFICIAL TOLD P0LOFF RECENTLY THAT THE PARTY 
STRUCTURE REACHES EVEN THE COUNTY LEVEL (DAIRA) IN 
SOME WILAYAS.  THE ORGANIZATION ALSO HAS THE 
EXPERIENCE OF TWO NATIONAL POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS, 
THOSE OF 1991 AND 1995, BEHIND IT.  IN THE LAST SIX 
MONTHS, HAMAS HAS STARTED TUNING ITS WILAYA ENGINES 
AGAIN WITH MEETINGS CRISS-CROSSING ALGERIA. 
N0TABLY, HAMAS IS WORKING WESTERN ALGERIA, OFTEN THE 
ORPHAN OF ALGERIAN POLITICS.  (COMMENT:  OFFICIAL 
FIGURES STATED THAT NAHNAH WON 40 PERCENT OF THE 
VOTES IN 0RAN, ALGERIA\'S SECOND LARGEST WILAYA IN 
1995.  PRIVATELY, THE SHEIKH\'S AIDES SAY THEY 
CAPTURED ABOUT 50 PERCENT, AND WON CLEAR MAJORITIES 
IN SOME ORAN DAIRAS.  END COMMENT.) 
 
HAMAS WOMEN\'S GROUP 
------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE HAMAS 
ORGANIZATION IS ITS SPECIAL SECTION OF WOMEN 
ACTIVISTS, DIRECTED BY A WOMAN FROM THE BERBER 
KABYLIE REGION, MALIKA CHABANI.  CHABANI DIRECTS 
BRANCHES IN MOST MAJOR ALGERIAN CITIES.  THESE 
GROUPS UNDERTAKE COMMUNITY PROJECTS, RANGING FROM 
TEACHING SEWING AND KNITTING TO LITERACY COURSES. 
POLITICAL OBSERVERS HERE IN 1995 TOLD US THAT THE 
HAMAS WOMEN ACTIVISTS WERE ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE IN 
DOOR-TO-DOOR CAMPAIGNING, TARGETING WOMEN IN 
LOWER-INCOME DISTRICTS IN AN UNMATCHED STYLE OF 
DIRECT POLITICS.  A JOURNALIST WHO HAS STUDIED THESE 
GROUPS TOLD POLOFF IN FEBRUARY THAT THEY HAVE 
REDUCED THEIR ACTIVITIES IN RECENT MONTHS IN ORDER 
TO MAINTAIN A LOWER PROFILE WITH SUSPICIOUS 
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. 
 
AND ALLIES IN ASSOCIATIONS 
-------------------------- 
 
11.  (C)  HAMAS ALSO RECEIVES HELP FROM TWO 
OFFICIALLY NON-POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS.  THE NATIONAL 
CHARITY ASSOCIATION, \"EL-ISLAH WEL-IRSHAD\" (\'REFORM 
AND GUIDANCE\') WAS ESTABLISHED BY NAHNAH IN THE MID 
1980\'S BEFORE ISLAMIST PARTIES WERE LEGAL.  ONE 
RESEARCHER TOLD US HAMAS IS VIRTUALLY 
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE CHARITY GROUP, AS THEIR 
NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEADERSHIPS ARE NEARLY 
IDENTICAL.  EL-ISLAH DONATES FOOD AND CLOTHING TO 
THE POOR, AND HAS AN ACTIVE RAMADAN MEAL PROGRAM. 
IT ALSO WORKS WITH HOME-BASED INDUSTRY PROJECTS WITH 
ALGERIAN W0MEN.  ACCORDING TO JOURNALISTS, SOME OF 
ITS MEMBERS OPERATE OPENLY FROM PARTICULAR MOSQUES 
IN WILAYAS SUCH AS ALGIERS AND BLIDA (NAHNAH\'S 
HOMET0WN).  DURING THE 1995 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, 
MANY EL-ISLAH ACTIVISTS UNDERTOOK DOOR-TO-DOOR 
CAMPAIGNING 0N BEHALF OF CANDIDATE NAHNAH, ACCORDING 
T0 JOURNALISTS AND POLITICAL PARTY SOURCES. 
 
12.  (C)  SIMILARLY, THE GENERAL UNI0N 0F FREE 
STUDENTS (UGEL), ACTIVE ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES, ALSO 
HAS CLOSE LINKS TO THE HAMAS PARTY, ACCORDING TO A 
VARIETY 0F SOURCES.  TWO UGEL LEADERS TOLD US 
FEBRUARY 5 THAT THE UNION HAS 46,000 MEMBERS.  THE 
UGEL\'S MAIN WORK IS ON STUDENT ISSUES, SUCH AS 
CAMPUS H0USING AND TRANSPORT.  THE UGEL 0FFICIALS 
SAID SOME MEMBERS SUPPORT NON-ISLAMIST PARTIES, BUT 
THEY RECOGNIZED THE UGEL\'S PREVI0US SUPPORT FOR 
HAMAS.  DURING THE 1995 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MANY 
UGEL MEMBERS CAMPAIGNED ACTIVELY FOR NAHNAH, 
ACCORDING TO J0URNALISTS AND POLITICAL PARTY SOURCES. 
 
13.  (C)  THE PRESIDENT OF BLIDA UNIVERSITY TOLD 
POLOFF IN DECEMBER THAT THE UGEL IS BY FAR THE MOST 
ACTIVE 0F THE STUDENT GROUPS ON HIS CAMPUS; HE 
ESTIMATED THE BLIDA CHAPTER HAD \"SEVERAL HUNDRED\" 
MEMBERS 0N A CAMPUS 0F 17,000 STUDENTS.  THE 
PRESIDENT ALLEGED THAT THE UGEL CHAPTER\'S FUNDING 
COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE HAMAS PARTY.  THE UGEL 
LEADERS SAID 0NLY THAT FUNDING C0MES FROM A VARIETY 
OF L0CAL S0URCES; THEY WOULD NOT CONFIRM THAT HAMAS 
PROVIDES FINANCING. 
 
IN SOME MOSQUES TOO 
------------------- 
 
14.  (C)  P0LITICAL PARTY AND JOURNALIST SOURCES 
ALS0 ALLEGE THAT HAMAS HAS A NETWORK OF SUPPORT 
AMONG VARIOUS MOSQUES.  0NE INFORMED REPORTER 
CLAIMED THAT A MEMBER OF HAMAS\' MAJLIS ASH-SHURA 
GIVES THE FRIDAY SERMON MOST WEEKS AT THE MAIN 
MOSQUE IN THE ALGIERS DISTRICT 0F BACHDJARRAH (WHERE 
THIS SOURCE LIVES).  AN ISLAMIST DOCTOR WITH FAMILY 
IN THE LARBA, OUTSIDE ALGIERS, CLAIMS THAT THE IMAM 
AT THE MAIN MOSQUE IN LARBA IS A HAMAS ACTIVIST; THE 
GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS HIM IN ORDER TO STEM THE TIDE OF 
EXTREMISM IN THE VIOLENCE-PLAGUED TOWN.  SIMILARLY, 
WE HAVE HEARD FROM SEVERAL SOURCES THAT HAMAS 
ACTIVISTS ARE PROMINENT IN MOSQUES IN BLIDA, 
NAHNAH\'S HOME TOWN. 
 
WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR MONEY? 
----------------------------- 
 
15.  (C)  LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HAMAS FINANCING 
OUTSIDE THE PARTY, BUT THE NEWLY PASSED PARTY LAW, 
WHICH GOVERNS FINANCING, MAY IMPEDE HAMAS\' 
FUNDRAISING.  HAMAS OFFICIALS WERE VISIBLY UNHAPPY 
WITH THE NEWLY PASSED PARTY LAW\'S CEILING ON 
INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS (THE LIMIT IS DA 450--IE. 
USD 8--MONTHLY).  IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH US, 
HAMAS OFFICIALS HAVE IMPLIED THAT THEY HAVE WEALTHY 
CONTRIBUTORS LOCALLY.  IN ADDITION, MANY OBSERVERS 
HERE THINK HAMAS RECEIVES FINANCIAL HELP FROM SMALL 
AND MEDIUM-SIZE BUSINESSES IN TOWNS SUCH AS BLIDA. 
FINALLY, SEVERAL POLITICAL JOURNALISTS--BOTH PRO- 
AND ANTI-ISLAMIST--ASSUME THAT HAMAS RECEIVES FUNDS 
FROM PRIVATE SOURCES IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. 
(COMMENT:  THE NEW PARTY LAW WOULD BAN SUCH 
CONTRIBUTI0NS.  END COMMENT.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16.  (C)  HAMAS PROBABLY WILLQOMPLETELY 
ECLIPSE THE FIS--DESPITE GOA EFFORTS TO SURPRESS 
TOTALLY THIS ORGANIZATION--WITHIN ALGERIA\'S ISLAMIST 
MOVEMENT.  MANY DEDICATED SUPPORTERS OF THE FIS ARE 
LIKELY T0 REMAIN OPPOSED TO ANY AFFILIATION WITH 
HAMAS, PARTICULARILY SINCE MANY ALSO BELIEVE NAHNAH 
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BETRAYING AN EARLIER ARMED 
ISLAMIST LEADER (BOUYALI) IN THE 1980\'S. 
 
17.  (C)  NONETHELESS, WE ARE SKEPTICAL OF CLAIMS 
THAT HAMAS\' FOLLOWING WOULD EVAPORATE WERE THE FIS 
TO BE AGAIN ALLOWED TO FUNCTION LEGALLY.  FOR ONE 
THING, A P0RTION OF FORMER FIS SUPPORTERS ARE 
REPULSED BY THE TERRORISM FOR WHICH THEY HOLD THE 
FIS ACC0UNTABLE.  IN ADDITION, HAMAS ALSO HAS 
DEVELOPED A DISTINCT BASE OF ITS OWN, LARGELY 
THROUGH PATIENT GRASSR0OTS WORK.  DURING THE 
UPCOMING LEGISLATIVE ELECTION CAMPAIGN, HAMAS WILL 
SEEK TO BROADEN ITS APPEAL T0 THE MASS OF FIS VOTERS 
FROM 1990 AND 1991 WHO PRESUMABLY SEEK ALTERNATIVES 
AFTER YEARS OF DISAPPOINTMENT.  IN 1995, MANY OF 
THESE VOTERS TURNED TO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
NAHNAH.  (ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL RESULTS, NAHNAH 
WON 25 PERCENT--ABOUT 2.8 MILLION VOTES--IN THE 1995 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTI0N.  WE EVEN HEARD STORIES THAT 
ARMED GR0UPS URGED V0TERS IN SOME ALGIERS 
NEIGHBORH0ODS T0 VOTE F0R NAHNAH.) 
 
18.  (C)  THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH OF THE HAMAS ORGANIZATION. 
FIRST, THE NEW LAW REGULATING POLITICAL PARTIES 
OUTLAWS LINKS BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTIES AND 
NON-POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS, SUCH AS STUDENT GROUPS 
AND CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS.  HAMAS WILL REORGANIZE 
THESE TIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE LAW.  SECOND, 
SOME DOUBT THAT HAMAS COULD MAINTAIN COHESION IF 
NAHNAH DEPARTS THE SCENE SUDDENLY.  INDEED, THE 
FOCUS ON NAHNAH PREVENTS OTHER MEMBERS 0F THE HAMAS 
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL AND MAJLES ASH-SHOURA FROM 
BUILDING THEIR OWN REPUTATIONS.  (BY CONTRAST, THE 
FIS HAD, IN BASEBALL TERMS, \"DEEP DEPTH;\" WHEN 
ABASSI MADANI AND BENHADJ WERE ARRESTED IN JUNE 
1991, ABDELKADER HACHANI AND MOHAMED SAID ABLY LED 
THE PARTY TO ELECTORAL VICTORY IN DECEMBER.)  HAMAS\' 
SECOND ECHELON LEADERS ARE USUALLY UNDER FORTY YEARS 
OLD, AND THEY HAVE TIME T0 BUILD THEIR NATIONAL 
CREDENTIALS.  M0REOVER, WITH HAMAS EXPECTED TO WIN 
MANY SEATS IN THE NEXT, ELECTED PARLIAMENT, THESE 
YOUNGER LEADERS MAY GAIN A MORE PROMINENT ROLE. 
0VER COMING WEEKS, IF TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT, WE 
WILL DEVEL0P DETAILS ON THE FUTURE LEADERS 0F 
ALGERIA\'S DOMINANT ISLAMIST 0RGANIZATION.

1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RONALD NEUMANN,

2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE ABILITY OF THE LONG-BANNED 
ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT (FIS) TO RESTRAIN THE 
ISLAMIST ARMED GROUPS HERE IS QUESTIONABLE.  OVER 
TIME, HOWEVER, THE BARBAROUS ATROCITIES OF THE ARMED 
ISLAMIC GROUP (GIA) MAY BE WORKING IN THE FIS\' FAVOR 
AMONG ISLAMIST ARMED GROUPS.  THERE ARE SIGNS, 
ALBEIT SMALL AND TENTATIVE, THAT MORE GROUPS ARE 
CLAIMING LOYALTY TO THE ORIGINAL FIS LEADERSHIP OF 
ABASSI MADANI AND ALI BENHADJ (JAILED SINCE 1991). 
THERE ARE ALSO SOME HINTS THAT THESE GROUPS ARE 
JOINING OR AT LEAST WORKING TOGETHER.  THEY HAVE 
CALLED FOR MORAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORT FROM OUTSIDE 
ISLAMIC \"MOVEMENTS\" (INCLUDING, PERHAPS, IRAN).  THE 
NEW EFFORTS TOWARDS COORDINATION OR UNITY MAY NOT 
SUCCEED IN THE END; THE ARMED ISLAMIST GROUPS ON THE 
WHOLE REMAIN SERIOUSLY SPLIT IN TERMS OF IDEOLOGY 
AND LEADERSHIP.  WE SEE NO SIGN THAT THEY ARE 
STRONGER MILITARILY.  IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE GIVEN 
NO INDICATION THEY WILL BE LOYAL TO THE FIS 
LEADERSHIP IN EXILE, UNDER REBAH KEBIR IN GERMANY. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
A NEW FIS ATTACK ON THE GIA 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  THERE ARE SOME SMALL, AND STILL TENTATIVE, 
INDICATIONS THAT THE ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT (FIS) 
IS TRYING TO REASSERT CONTROL OVER THE ARMED GROUPS 
ONCE LOYAL TO THE ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP (GIA).  THE 
TREND SO FAR APPEARS LIMITED MAINLY TO CENTRAL 
ALGERIA.  THE FEBRUARY 1997 ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 
ISLAMIC LEAGUE FOR THE (ISLAMIC) CALL AND FOR DJIHAD 
(IN FRENCH, LIDD) EMPHASIZES THE LEAGUE\'S LOYALTY TO 
ABASSI MADANI AND ALI BENHADJ (SEE REFS A AND B). 
(IT ALSO PRAISES THE MEMORY OF ANOTHER FIS LEADER, 
MOHAMED SAID, THE LEADER OF THE FIS\' DJAZAIR\'IST 
WING.)  FOUR MEN SIGNED THE COMMUNIQUE.  THE FIRST 
TWO, ALI BENHADJER AND MAHFOUD RAHMANI HIGHLIGHTED 
THEIR STATUS AS FIS OFFICIALS ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT 
IN 1991; THE THIRD, YOUSSEF BOUBRAS, NOTES THAT HE 
WAS THE FIS PRESIDENT OF THE BOUIRA OFFICE AND LATER 
A MEMBER OF THE FIS EXECUTIVE OFFICE. 
 
4.  (S)  THE LIDD COMMUNIQUE SINGLES OUT THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S \"PLOT\" AGAINST THE ISLAMIC DJIHAD IN 
ALGERIA AS BEING EMBODIED IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE 
ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP (GIA).  THE CAMPAIGN, THE LIDD 
SAID, DEVIATED INTO KILLING THE \"BEST SCHOLARS, 
PREACHERS AND MOUJADHIDINE.\"  IT THEN SAID THAT 
FAITHFUL MUSLEM SOLDIERS ARE, THEREFORE, QUITTING 
THE GIA.  IT CALLS ON THOSE YOUNG MEN IN THE GIA TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT MASSACRES ARE NOT JUSTIFIABLE UNDER 
ISLAM, BUT RATHER ARE THE WORK OF THE ALGERIAN 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. 
 
5.  (S)  THE LIDD COMMUNIQUE TOUCHES ONLY BRIEFLY ON 
RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  IT STRONGLY 
DENOUNCES PAST FRENCH COLONIAL POLICY IN ALGERIA. 
(IT MAKES NO MENTION OF THE U.S.)  IT ALSO CALLS ON 
\"OTHER ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS\" TO PROVIDE SPIRITUAL AND 
MATERIAL AIDE TO THE ALGERIAN DJIHAD.  (COMMENT: 
THE LIDD MIGHT LOOK TO THE IRANIANS AND OTHERS FOR 
ASSISTANCE.  WE RECALL THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE 
DENOUNCED PUBLICLY THE GIA\'S CAMPAIGN OF 
INDISCRIMINATE CAR BOMBINGS IN ALGERIA AS THE WORK 
OF ALGERIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  END COMMENT.) 
 
6.  (C)  THE GIA\'S MURDER OF MOHAMED SAID AND HIS 
FOLLOWERS IN LATE 1995 SPURRED A NUMBER OF LOCAL GIA 
MEMBERS TO QUIT THE GROUP IN EARLY 1996 (SEE REFS C, 
D).  AN APPARENTLY GENUINE \"AL-DJIHAD\" BULLETIN FROM 
THE SPRING OF 1996 CLAIMED THAT THESE GROUPS 
EXTENDED FROM THE LARBAA AND MEDEA REGIONS SOUTH OF 
THE CAPITAL (THE MEDEA GROUP LED BY ALI BENHADJER) 
TO BOUSAADA ON THE HIGH PLATEAU.  WE REPORTED LAST 
YEAR THAT SOME OF THESE GIA SPLINTERS WERE 
SYMPATHETIC TO MOHAMED SAID AND HAD REGROUPED UNDER 
THE BANNER OF THE OLD DJAZAIR\'IST AL-FIDA GROUP. 
 
7.  (C)  IN THE FEBRUARY 1997 LIDD COMMUNIQUE, THE 
FOURTH SIGNER IS \"AHMED ABOU EL-FIDA,\" SAID TO BE 
THE COMMANDER OF THE AL-FIDA.  (COMMENT:  WE DO NOT 
KNOW EXACTLY WHO AHMED ABOU AL-FIDA IS.  ACCORDING 
TO A WELL-INFORMED JOURNALIST, WHO HAS SOURCES IN 
THE ALGERIAN SECURITY SERVICES, HIS REAL NAME IS 
ABDELLAH SEDOUKI (NFI).  WE HAVE OBTAINED AN 
APPARENTLY GENUINE COMMUNIQUE FROM AHMED ABOU 
AL-FIDA CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JANUARY 28 
KILLING OF ABDELHAK BENHAMOUDA, PRESIDENT ZEROUAL\'S 
ALLY.  END COMMENT.)  THE LIDD COMMUNIQUE, THUS, 
SUGGESTS THAT AL-FIDA OF CENTRAL ALGERIA HAS 
RETURNED FULL CIRCLE FROM THE GIA TO THE FIS. 
 
8.  (C)  IN ADDITION, THE LIDD\'S MAHFOUD RAHMANI 
COMES FROM M\'SILA, WHILE YOUSSEF BOUBRAS COMES FROM 
BOUIRA.  (A LAWYER IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH FIS 
LEADERS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE ALGERIA TOLD US JANUARY 
28 OF A MID-JANUARY AMBUSH AGAINST THE ALGERIAN ARMY 
WHICH KILLED DOZENS OF SOLDIERS IN BOUIRA.)  THUS, 
THE LIDD SUGGESTS, ALBEIT TENTATIVELY, THAT ARMED 
GROUPS LOYAL TO THE FIS NOW EXTEND FROM MEDEA EAST 
TO BOUIRA AND PERHAPS EVEN TO M\'SILA AND BOUSAADA TO 
THE SOUTHEAST. 
 

8.  (S)  (COMMENT:  IF/IF THIS IS TRUE, IT IS A 
DIFFERENT PICTURE OF THE ARMED GROUPS FROM WHAT WE 
SAW IN LATE 1994 AND THROUGHOUT 1995 AND 1996. 
DURING THAT TIME, THERE WERE FEW SIGNS THAT THE FIS, 
DEFINED AS THE LEADERSHIP OF ABASSI MADANI AND ALI 
BENHADJ, HAD THE LOYALTY OF ANY ARMED GROUPS OUTSIDE 
THE ISLAMIC SALVATION ARMY (AIS) GROUPS IN THE 
JIJEL/SKIKDA REGION IN THE EAST AND THE 
RELIZANE/MASCARA/SIDI BEL ABBES REGION IN THE WEST. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
 
ANOTHER GIA SPLIT:  AL-BAQAOUN 
------------------------------ 
 
9.  (C)  THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE OTHER 
IN-FIGHTING INSIDE THE GIA DURING THE PAST YEAR (SEE 
REF D ABOUT WESTERN ALGERIA, FOR EXAMPLE).  NOTABLY, 
GIA GROUPS AROUND CHLEF IN DECEMBER 1996 REPORTEDLY 
REBELLED AGAINST THE CORE GIA UNDER ANTAR ZOUABRI 
AND ELECTED A FORMER FIGHTER FROM AFGHANISTAN NAMED 
SLIMANE MAHERZI AS THEIR LEADER, ACCORDING TO THE 
SOMETIMES WELL-INFORMED LONDON NEWSPAPER ASH-SHARQ 
AL-AWSET (REF E).  MAHERZI, WHOSE WAR NAME IS 
ABDERAHMANE ABOU DJAMIL, WAS ALSO REPORTED TO BE THE 
LEADER OF AL-BAQAOUN \'ALA AL-\'AHD, ACCORDING TO THE 
OFTEN WELL-INFORMED LONDON NEWSPAPER AL-HAYAT (REF 
F).  ACCORDING TO THESE LONDON PRESS SOURCES, ABOU 
DJAMIL\'S BASE OF OPERATION IS WEST OF THE CAPITAL 
BETWEEN CHLEF AND BLIDA. 
 
10.  (C)  WHILE MAHERZI APPEARS TO HAVE SPLIT WITH 
THE GIA UNDER ZOUABRI, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF HE HAS 
ALIGNED WITH BENHADJER\'S LIDD AGAINST THEIR COMMON 
ENEMIES, ZOUABRI AND THE ALGERIAN ARMY.  A 
WELL-INFORMED ALGERIAN JOURNALIST ASSERTED THAT 
AL-BAQAOUN IS PART OF THE LEAGUE (SEE REF B).  THE 
FRENCH EMBASSY PROVIDED US A COPY OF A POSSIBLY 
GENUINE JANUARY 1997 AL-BAQAOUN COMMUNIQUE WHICH 
CONFIRMED AL-FIDA KILLED ABDELHAK BENHAMOUDA AND 
CALLED AL-FIDA THE FAITHFUL\'S \"COLLEAGUES.\"  THE 
COMMUNIQUE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE MURDER AND THE 
AL-FIDA CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY; IT SUGGESTS THAT 
THE TWO GROUPS MIGHT BE IN REGULAR CONTACT.  IN 
ADDITION, THE SEPTEMBER 1996 AL-BAQAOUN COMMUNIQUE 
REFERS TO THE UNJUSTIFIED GIA KILLING OF \"PREACHERS 
AND MOUJAHIDINE\"--LANGUAGE IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE 
AL-FIDA AND THE LIDD IN FEBRUARY 1997.  MOREOVER, 
THE OATH IN THE GROUP\'S NAME IS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, 
ONE OF LOYALTY TO MADANI AND BENHADJ, JUST AS THAT 
EXPRESSED BY BENHADJER (SEE REFS B AND D). 
 
11.  (C)  NOT ALL SIGNS SUGGEST THAT AL-BAQAOUN 
DEFINITELY HAS JOINED WITH AL-FIDA, AND HENCE TO THE 
LIDD.  THE AL-BAQAOUN COMMUNIQUE ABOUT BENHAMOUDA 
WAS IN FRENCH, WHICH MADE SOME OBSERVERS WHO SAW IT 
IMMEDIATELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THE COMMUNIQUE WAS A 
GOVERNMENT-PRODUCED FAKE.  WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED AN 
APPARENTLY GENUINE FEBRUARY 1997 AL-BAQAOUN 
COMMUNIQUE, IN ARABIC, WHICH STRONGLY DENOUNCES 
THOSE WHO WOULD NEGOTIATE WITH THE ALGERIAN 
GOVERNMENT.  THE SEPTEMBER 1996 COMMUNIQUE DID SO AS 
WELL.  SINCE MADANI AND BENHADJ DID TALK WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT IN 1994 AND 1995, ABOU DJAMIL\'S LOYALTY 
TO THEM WOULD HAVE TO BE QUESTIONABLE IF EITHER 
COMMUNIQUE IS GENUINE. 
 
 
12.  (C)  MEANWHILE, THE FIS LEADERSHIP IN EXILE HAS 
UNDERGONE OTHER TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE PAST MONTH. 
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT EXPELLED KHEIREDINE KHERBANE 
FROM ITS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  OUR FIS LAWYER SOURCE 
TOLD US MARCH 10 THAT KHERBANE TOO OFTEN STRAYED 
PUBLICLY FROM THE OFFICIAL FIS LINE.  IN ADDITION, 
HE SAID, KHERBANE\'S CONTACTS IN LONDON WITH PERSONS 
THOUGHT LINKED TO THE GIA MADE KEBIR AND OTHER FIS 
OFFICIALS NERVOUS.  HE ADDED THAT THE EXECUTIVE 
COMMITTEE HAS APPOINTED ABDELKRIM OULD ADDA, A 
PROFESSOR ORIGINALLY FROM MOSTAGANEM AND A KEBIR 
AIDE, TO BE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\'S SPOKESMAN. 
THIS SOURCE BELIEVES THE CHANGES TO THE EXECUTIVE 
COMMITTEE AIM AT CONSOLIDATING KEBIR\'S AUTHORITY 
OVER THE COMMITTEE. 
 
 
COMMENT: 
------- 
 
13.  (C)  COMPARED TO ANALYSES OF ALGERIA\'S 
SPLINTERED ARMED ISLAMIST GROUPS, ECONOMICS IS AN 
EXTREMELY PRECISE SCIENCE.  LOCAL RIVALRIES, 
IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES, AND THE GROUPS\' INSTINCTIVE 
PENCHANT FOR SECRECY AND NAME CHANGES, NOT TO 
MENTION FAKE COMMUNIQUES AND OTHER PRESSURE FROM THE 
ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT, MAKE ALL JUDGEMENTS HIGHLY 
PRONE TO ERROR.  NONETHELESS, WE HAZARD THAT THE 
FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: 
 
--  THE RUTHLESS TACTICS OF ANTAR ZOUABRI AND THE 
\"CORE\" GIA HAVE ALIENATED SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THE 
GROUP\'S MEMBERS; 
 
--  THERE ARE NEW (OR RENEWED) GROUPS IN CENTRAL 
ALGERIA WHO EITHER BY COMMUNIQUE OR BY THEIR VERY 
NAME HAVE LEFT THE GIA AND AGAIN CLAIM LOYALTY TO 
THE TRADITIONAL FIS LEADERSHIP OF ABASSI MADANI AND 
ALI BENHADJ; 
 
--  THESE GROUPS\' LOYALTY TO THE TRADITIONAL FIS 
LEADERSHIP, CREATES A NEW ALIGNMENT OF ISLAMIST 
FORCES BOTH IN CENTRAL ALGERIA, AND PERHAPS EVEN 
NATIONALLY, COMPARED TO THE DISPOSITION OF 1994 OR 
1995; 
 
--  IN ADDITION, THE FIS APPEARS TO STILL HAVE THE 
LOYALTY OF THE ISLAMIC SALVATION ARMY, LOCATED IN 
EASTERN AND WESTERN ALGERIA; 
 
--  IT STILL SEEMS TOO EARLY TO KNOW IF EFFORTS BY 
GROUPS LIKE ALI BENHADJER\'S LIDD TO MERGE OR ALLY 
WITH OTHER ARMED GROUPS, LIKE AL-BAQAOUN, HAVE, IN 
FACT, SUCCEEDED; 
 
--  EFFORTS TO UNIFY ARE SIGNIFICANT MAINLY IN TERMS 
OF POLITICAL ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER;  AND 
 
--  TENTATIVE EFFORTS TO UNIFY THEIR RANKS DOES NOT 
MEAN THESE ARMED GROUPS ARE STRONGER MILITARILY; 
RATHER, THEIR EFFORTS MAY BE IN RESPONSE TO 
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE FROM THE \"CORE\" GIA AND THE 
ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
14.  (C)  WHILE THE LIDD, AL-FIDA AND AL-BAQAOUN 
COULD BE LOYAL TO THE FIS AS PERSONIFIED BY ABASSI 
MADANI AND ALI BENHADJ, NOWHERE HAVE WE SEEN THEM 
EXPRESS LOYALTY TO THE FIS LEADERSHIP IN EXILE UNDER 
REBAH KEBIR.  (INDEED, SOME OF THE AL-BAQAOUN 
COMMUNIQUES IMPLICITLY ATTACK THE EXILES.)  THUS, 
THE EXILE LEADERSHIP IS UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO DO 
MUCH TO REDUCE VIOLENCE.  EVEN THE EXTENT OF MADANI 
AND BENHADJ\'S ABILITY TO REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY THE 
ONGOING VIOLENCE IS QUESTIONABLE (AFTER ALL, THESE 
GROUPS MAY USE THEM AS A RALLYING POINT ONLY BECAUSE 
THEY ARE IN NO POSITION TO GIVE ORDERS).

TAGS: PTER, PREL, AG 
SUBJECT: AU COUNTERTERRORISM CONFERENCE RESULTS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR JANET A. SANDERSON FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.(U) THE AFRICAN UNION COUNTER-TERRORISM CONFERENCE, HELD IN 
ALGIERS SEPTEMBER 11-14, RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES 
REPORTING THAT THEY WOULD RATIFY THE 1999 ALGIERS CONVENTION 
ON THE PREVENTION AND COMBATING OF TERRORISM, A PLAN OF 
ACTION TO IMPLEMENT THE 1999 CONVENTION, AND AN AGREEMENT TO 
ESTABLISH AN AFRICAN COUNTER-TERRORISM CENTER.  IF THE 
COUNTRIES CLAIMING TO HAVE RATIFIED THE CONVENTION DEPOSIT 
THEIR RESPECTIVE INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIME, THE 
CONVENTION - AND ITS EXEMPTION OF \"FREEDOM FIGHTERS\" FROM A 
DEFINITION OF TERRORISM - WILL ENTER INTO FORCE.  WHILE 
VARIOUS AFRICAN DELEGATES MADE ELOQUENT AND IMPASSIONED 
PRESENTATIONS, IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE ALGERIANS HAD THE 
DOMINANT AGENDA AND USED THE MEETING TO SHOWCASE THEIR WON 
WAR ON TERRORISM, AS WELL AS THEIR AFRICAN CREDENTIALS.  IN 
THAT, THEIR PURPOSES WERE LARGELY MET.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BOUTFLIKA\'S MESSAGE ON TERRORISM AIMS AT HOME -- AND ABROAD 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2.(U) THE CONFERENCE OPENED WITH PRESIDENT ABDELAZIZ 
BOUTEFLIKA ADDRESSING THE DELEGATES AND EXPRESSING HIS 
SYMPATHY FOR THE \"GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE.\" THE PRESIDENT SPOKE 
OF AMERICANS AND ALGERIANS SHARING SADNESS AND ABOUT OUR 
COMMON WORK TO ERADICATE TERRORISM.  HE EXPRESSED HIS VIEW 
THAT THE AU MEETING IN ALGIERS WAS \"A SIGNIFICANT MARK OF 
RESPECT AND SOLIDARITY WITH THE ALGERIAN PEOPLE AND A HOMAGE 
TO THEIR LONG, DIFFICULT BATTLE AGAINST TERRORISM.\"  HOEVER, 
HE COMPLAINED,AS HE HAS IN THE PAST, THAT THE WORLD HAS BEEN 
TOO LONG SILENT ABOUT ALGERIA\'S OWN STRUGGLE WITH TERRORISM. 
HE DREW A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN TERRORISM AND INTERNATIONAL 
CRIME, NOTING THAT THE GREAT CHALLENGE OF THE 21ST CENTURY 
WILL BE TO ERADICATE \"INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\"  HE CALLED FOR 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO FACE THIS CHALLENGE, ASKING, 
\"WOULD YOU DEPRIVE US OF THIS ASSISTANCE WHILE WE ARE 
FIGHTING TOGETHER?\" HE ALSO ENCOURAGED THE CREATION OF AN 
AFRICAN CENTER TO STUDY SECURITY AND TO FIGHT TERRORISM. 
 
3.(U) TURNING HIS ATTENTION TO THE 1999 ALGIERS CONVENTION ON 
COMBATING AND PREVENTION OF TERRORISM, HE CALLED FOR A 
DOCUMENT THAT WOULD BAN TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS AND 
LAMENTED THE FACT \"THAT IT HASN\'T HAPPENED YET.\"  BOUTEFLIKA 
THEN SHIFTED INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE SPECIFIC TERRORIST 
PROBLEMS FACING ALGERIA.  HE REMINDED THE AUDIENCE THAT 
ALGERIANS ARE MUSLIMS AND THAT THEY CALL FOR AN ERADICATION 
OF TERRORISM.  ALGERIANS, ACCORDING TO BOUTEFLIKA, HAVE NEVER 
HESITATED TO DENOUNCE TERRORISM, EVEN WHEN IT HIDES BEHIND 
ISLAM. 
 
4.(U) DEPARTING FROM HIS PREPARED TEXT, BOUTEFLIKA STRONGLY 
ATTACKED THOSE WHO HAD CRITIZED HIS POLICY OF RECONCILATION 
AND \"CONCORD CIVIL\" IN THE WAKE OF ALGERIA\'S OWN WAR ON 
TERRORISM. HE EXPLAINED THAT DEMOCRACY MEANS YOU HAVE TO 
LISTEN TO OTHER\'S OPINIONS.  ACCORDING TO HIS VISION, CHANGE 
SHOULD COME THROUGH DIALOGUE, NOT VIOLENCE.  BOUTEFLIKA URGED 
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DEAL WITH THE ROOT CAUSES OF 
TERRORISM AND IN A REFERENCE TO BOTH ALGERIA\'S PAST AS WELL 
AS THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE, HE SAID, \"INTERNATIONAL 
COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY AND THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM 
MUST ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NEED TO PROVIDE JUSTICE TO 
THOSE WHO HAVE NO OTHER RECOURSE BUT ARMED STRUGGLE TO 
VALIDATE THEIR RIGHT TO EXIST AND TO DEMAND THEIR PLACE IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THE LEGITIMATE RESISTANCE OF 
SUCH PEOPLE, OFTEN SUPPORTED BY MODEST EFFORTS AND A LIMITED 
WILL, SHOULD NOT BE ANY WAY ASSOCIATED WITH TERRORISM.  THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY...MUST MEET ITS REPSONSIBLITIES TO 
PROVIDE LAW AND JUSTICE, MOST NOTABLY FOR THE WEAKEST AND THE 
MOST DOWNTRODDEN.  THAT IS THE BEST GUARANTEE OF LONGLASTING 
PEACE AND STABILITY.\" 
 
YOU WIN SOME... 
--------------- 
 
6.(U) DURING THE OPENING SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE, DELEGATES 
FROM SUDAN, SOUTH AFRICA AND GHANA REPORTED THAT THEIR 
COUNTRIES HAD RATIFIED THE 1999 ALGIERS CONVENTION AND THAT 
THE INSTRUMENTS WOULD BE DEPOSITED WITH THE AU SHORTLY.  WHEN 
THE LAST OF THESE INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED, THE 
CONVENTION WILL ENTER INTO FORCE AND THE AU WILL OFFICIALLY 
EXEMPT THOSE INVOLVED IN A \"STRUGGLE WAGED BY PEOPLES IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW FOR THEIR 
LIBERATION OR SELF-DETERMINATION, INCLUDING THE ARMED 
STRUGGLE AGAINST COLONIALISM, OCCUPATION, AGGRESSION AND 
DOMINATION BY FOREIGN FORCES\" FROM ITS DEFINITION OF 
TERRORISM.  THERE WAS NO DEBATE, OR EVEN A SPECIFIC MENTION 
ABOUT THIS EXEMPTION.  MANY OF THE DELEGATIONS INVITED AS 
OBSERVERS SEEMED NONCHALANT ABOUT THE CLAUSE, INCLUDING THE 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM MALAYSIA, SPAIN, FRANCE AND ENGLAND. 
SEVERAL DELEGATIONS PRAISED THE REPORTS OF RATIFICATION, 
NOTING THAT IT HAS TAKEN THREE YEARS TO GET RATIFICATION FROM 
THE REQUISITE 15 COUNTRIES. 
 
7.(U) A LARGE PART OF THE CONFERENCE WAS SPENT ON A PROPOSED 
PLAN OF ACTION TO IMPLEMENT THE 1999 CONVENTION.  ALTHOUGH 
MUCH DEBATE WAS HAD ON \"THE USE OF COMMAS AND FULL STOPS,\" 
THERE WAS LITTLE SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION ON THE PLAN\'S SCOPE, 
LIMITATIONS OR FUNDING.  A COPY OF THE FINAL PLAN OF ACTION 
WILL BE DELIVERED TO DEPARTMENT SEPARATELY. 
 
...AND YOU LOSE SOME 
-------------------- 
 
8.(U) BY THE TIME AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED ON THE PLAN OF 
ACTION, MOST DELEGATES WERE IN NO MOOD TO CONTINUE INTO THE 
NIGHT TO DISCUSS A PROPOSED PROTOCOL TO THE 1999 CONVENTION. 
THE PROTOCOL WAS MOSTLY AUTHORED BY THE SENEGALESE, AS A 
CAPSTONE TO THEIR DAKAR DECLARATION OF OCTOBER 1998.  AFTER 
MAKING A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR THE NEED FOR SUCH A PROTOCOL, 
THE SENEGALESE DELEGATION GLUMLY SAT THROUGH A NUMBER OF 
ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT.  THE SENEGALESE DEFENDED THE PROTOCOL, 
CLAIMING THE 1999 CONVENTION NEEDED ENHANCEMENT IN ORDER TO 
ADDRESS ISSUES THAT WERE UNFORESEEN THREE YEARS AGO, 
INCLUDING THE NEED TO CRIMINALIZE MONEY LAUNDERING AND OTHER 
SIMILAR TOPICS. 
 
9.(C) REALIZING THAT A CONSENSUS TO KILL THE PROTOCOL WAS 
BUILDING (AND THAT IT WAS NEARLY 11 P.M.), THE ALGERIAN 
CHAIRMAN PUT AN END TO THE DEBATE AND DECREED THAT THE 
DELEGATES SHOULD COLLECT FURTHER OPINIONS ON THE PROPOSED 
PROTOCOL AND THAT IT WOULD BE DEBATED AT THE NEXT AU SUMMIT. 
(COMMENT. THE PROPOSED TERRORISM PROTOCOL COULD BE 
PROBLEMATIC: IT INCLUDES AN ARTICLE -- DEALING WITH THE PEACE 
AND SECURITY COUNCIL -- WHICH GIVES AUTHORITY TO THE COUNCIL 
TO \"MAKE APPROPRIATE CONTACTS WITH MEMBER STATES AS WELL AS 
NON-MEMBER STATES ON ALL MATTERS RELATING TO TERRORISM AND 
THE ACTIVITIES OF TERRORIST GROUPS.\"  DEPENDING UPON THE 
INTERPRETATION AND EXECUTION OF THIS ARTICLE, IT MAY AFFECT 
USG CT EFFORTS ON A BILATERAL BASIS.  END COMMENT.) 
 
NOT JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER 
------------------------------- 
 
10.(U) MUCH OF THE DEBATE, ON BOTH THE PLAN OF ACTION AND THE 
PROTOCOL, CENTERED ON A DIFFERENT PROTOCOL WHICH HAS NOT YET 
ENTERED INTO FORCE.  THIS PROTOCOL, RELATING TO THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PEACE AND SECURITY COUNCIL (PSC WAS 
ISSUED AND SIGNED BY HEADS OF STATE AT THE DURBAN AU SUMMIT 
IN JULY 2002.  (NOTE:  THIS PROTOCOL ALSO CALLS FOR \"PANEL OF 
THE WISE,\" A CONTINENTAL EARLY WARNING SYSTEM, AN AFRICAN 
STANDBY FORCE, AND A \"PEACE-BUILDING CAPACITY.\"  END NOTE) 
AU OFFICIALS TOLD USDEL THAT A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF AU MEMBERS 
ARE EXPECTED TO RATIFY THE PROTOCOL IN TIME TO BE EFFECTIVE 
BY THE NEXT AU SUMMIT, IN MAPUTO IN 2003. 
 
11.(C) ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL VERSION OF THE PROPOSED 
PROTOCOL, THE PSC WILL CONSIST OF 15 COUNTRIES, THREE EACH 
FROM FIVE AFRICAN REGIONS.  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CRITERIA 
LISTED FOR MEMBERSHIP TO THE PSC, AU OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT 
COUNTRIES LIKE SUDAN, LIBERIA, ZIMBABWE COULD NEVER SERVE ON 
THE PSC - OR MORE IMPORTANTLY, SERVE AS THE CHAIR - BECAUSE 
OF THESE CRITERIA.  WHEN PRESSED FOR DETAILS OF THE VETTING 
PROCESS, AN AU OFFICIAL CONCEDED THAT IT WOULD BE THROUGH 
\"PEER PRESSURE.\"  ACCORDING TO THE PROTOCOL, THE PSC WILL BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 1999 CONVENTION ON 
TERRORISM. 
 
WE SAID IT FIRST 
---------------- 
 
12.(U) AFTER A SPIRITED DEBATE OVER THE FUNDING AND SCOPE OF 
THE PROPOSAL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TERRORISM STUDY AND 
RESEARCH CENTER, THE ALGERIAN DELEGATION STRONG-ARMED THE 
DELEGATES INTO ACCEPTING ALGERIA AS THE CENTER\'S SITE.  THE 
SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION ARGUED THAT REGIONAL CAPACITY SHOULD 
BE DEVELOPED BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO HAVE A CONTINENTAL PROGRAM. 
 THEY CLAIMED THAT THE IMMEDIATE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A 
CENTER WOULD WEAKEN MANY BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE AREAS 
OF TRAINING, COOPERATION, AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.  THE 
TANZANIAN DELEGATION AGREED THAT A NEED FOR THE CENTER 
EXISTS, BUT INSISTED THAT THE DEVIL WAS IN THE DETAILS. 
ADDITIONALLY, THE DELEGATIONS FROM BURKINA FASO, KENYA AND 
SUDAN ASKED FOR MORE TIME TO STUDY THE PROPOSAL.  THE 
CHAIRMAN WENT ON TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT TERRORISM DOESN\'T 
WAIT, IT STRIKES QUICKLY.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE TERRORISM 
CENTER WOULD ANSWER THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY ALL AU MEMBERS. 
 
13.(U) BOTH THE ALGERIAN DELEGATION AND THE INTERIM 
COMMISSIONER FOR THE PSC, ALGERIAN SAID DJINNIT, ARGUED THAT 
THE DECISION FOR AN AFRICAN CT CENTER WAS MADE AT THE AU 
SUMMIT IN DURBAN.  CITING AN AU TRADITION THAT ONCE A 
DECISION IS MADE AT THE SUMMIT LEVEL, MEMBER COUNTRIES HAVE 
ALWAYS ACCEPTED IT, THE ALGERIAN CHAIRMAN OF THE CONFERENCE 
DECLARED THAT ALGERIA WOULD BE THE LOCATION FOR THE CT 
CENTER.  BESIDES, HE ADDED, ALGERIA HAD BEEN THE ONLY COUNTRY 
TO MAKE AN OFFER TO HOST THE CENTER.  HE CONTINUED THAT 
ALTHOUGH THE CT CENTER WOULD FOLLOW THE AU\'S TRADITION OF 
FUNDING FROM THE ORDINARY BUDGET, THE ALGERIANS WOULD BE 
LOOKING FOR BUDGET CONTRIBUTIONS, EVEN SYMBOLIC ONES. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
14.(C) WHILE THE MEETING MAY NOT HAVE ENDED EXACTLY AS THE 
ALGERIANS WOULD HAVE WANTED, THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL ON SEVERAL 
COUNTS.  BOUTEFLIKA, THROUGH HIS HOSTING OF THE CONFERENCE ON 
THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS, ARTFULLY 
DEMONSTRATED HIS SOLIDARITY WITH THE US AND THE GLOBAL 
COALITION IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM.  A TERRORISM 
CENTER WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN (AND BENEFIT) ALGERIA WITH THE 
AU\'S IMPRIMATUR.  IT WAS CLEAR THROUGHOUT THE MEETING THAT 
THE EGYPTIANS AND THE ALGERIANS PLAN TO CONTROL THE AFRICAN 
CT CAMPAIGN, EITHER BY FORCE OF THEIR EFFORTS OR THROUGH THE 
LACK OF CAPACITY OF OTHER AU MEMBERS. 
 
15.(C) THE BEST SUMMARY OF THIS CONFERENCE MAY BE IN AN 
ANECDOTE PROVIDED BY A YOUNG AU STAFFER FROM ADDIS ABABA. 
ACCORDING TO THE STAFFER, THE PLAN WAS TO ONLY DISTRIBUTE THE 
DELEGATES\' PER DIEM ON THE VERY LAST DAY OF THE MEETING, THUS 
ENSURING THE MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION OF EACH OF THE DELEGATIONS.
