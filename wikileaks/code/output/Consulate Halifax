REF:  02 HALIFAX 196 
 
1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: Atlantic Canada and Halifax port 
officials are satisfied that the Canadian government\'s port 
security initiative, announced at a Halifax news conference by 
four federal cabinet ministers on January 22, is a step in the 
right direction.  Local officials welcomed the government\'s 
C$172 million package but have questions about how much of that 
money will end up at Halifax port.  Moreover, they insist that 
local efforts to bolster security at this port, such as 
tightening background checks on port employees and installing 
high-tech screening systems for incoming marine containers, are 
already accomplishing many of the objectives laid out in the 
federal government\'s five-year plan.   They are skeptical that 
the proposed package will take port security much farther than 
where the ports are going themselves at their own initiative, 
and they warn that some of the government\'s proposed measures 
fail to focus on the main threat: the possibility of a nuclear 
or chem-bio device hidden inside a shipping container entering 
Halifax from overseas but destined for the United States.  (END 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT) 
 
3.  (SBU) At a press conference on the Halifax waterfront, four 
federal cabinet ministers---Transport Minister David Collenette, 
Solicitor General Wayne Easter, Fisheries Minister Robert 
Thibault, and Customs/Revenue Minister Elinor Caplan---announced 
the government\'s plan to spend C$172 over five years on new 
computers, scanning equipment, training, and police and Customs 
services to enhance security at the country\'s three major ports 
of Halifax, Vancouver, and Montreal.  The government\'s plan, 
according to Collenette, will result in increased surveillance 
of marine traffic, more thorough screening passengers and crew, 
installation of new detection equipment in ports to screen 
shipping containers, improvement in the capacity of the RCMP to 
investigate and respond to potential security breaches, 
establishment of restricted port areas, and new requirements 
that port workers undergo thorough background checks. 
 
4.  (SBU) Officials of Halifax port and Canada Customs in 
Atlantic Canada told CG that they welcome the government\'s 
announcement but are waiting to see how Ottawa will divide up 
the C$172 million.  They commented that the most acute need is 
for money to cover the purchase and maintenance of the expensive 
gamma-ray scanners known as VACIS (Vehicle and Cargo Inspection 
System) and other new high-tech equipment.  Halifax Port Authority 
officials noted wryly that the port has already been purchasing 
and installing VACIS scanners, at considerable cost, over the 
past six months with no help from Ottawa (SEE REFTEL).  Our 
local contacts were somewhat dismayed that the visiting federal 
ministers seemed unaware that, since the September 11 terrorist 
attacks, Halifax port and Canada Customs here have been 
implementing almost all of the measures laid out in the 
government\'s five-year plan.  For example, Halifax has already 
placed tighter controls on passengers and crew of visiting 
ships, established restricted areas within the port, tightened 
background checks for port employees, and made considerable 
progress in reinforcing the identification and screening of 
potentially suspect marine containers coming in to North America 
through Halifax port.  These local initiatives, Halifax 
officials feel, have received neither recognition nor support 
from Ottawa. 
 
5.  (SBU) The one substantial change contained in the federal 
announcement, according to our contacts, is the decision to 
augment the role of the RCMP in enforcing port security.  Until 
now, the RCMP here in Halifax has had no personnel permanently 
assigned at the port.   Canada Customs, with support from the 
two U.S. Customs inspectors who have been seconded here since 
last year, conducts all investigations and searches.    RCMP 
Inspector Bill Kazmel, the federal policing chief for Nova 
Scotia, told CG that the government\'s plan should enable his 
office to assign at least four RCMP members to full-time duty at 
the Halifax port.  Our local contacts also believe that the key 
to success will be a determination on the part of the federal 
government to ensure an equitable division of resources and 
coordination among the six agencies that will have to work 
together at the port: RCMP, Transport Canada, Canada Customs, 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada, CSIS, and the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
6.  (SBU) A few local officials told CG they doubted that the 
amount of money announced by the federal ministers will make a 
difference, noting that C$172 million over five years amounts to 
only C$34 million per year, and that sum has to be spread among 
six agencies at three different ports. 
 
7.  (SBU) Finally, our contacts warned that some of the 
government\'s measures---those that focus on perimeter security 
at the port facility itself and background checks for 
longshoremen---were missing the point: the main security threat 
at Halifax port does not emanate from local individuals coming 
onto port property, but rather from shipping containers coming 
in from overseas.  In light of the post-September 11 terrorism 
dangers, port security efforts should not focus on protecting 
foreign container ships from attack by local elements in 
Halifax, which is unlikely, but instead should focus on 
protecting North America from a potential hazard---such as a 
nuclear or biological device---that might conceivably be hidden 
inside a container coming from overseas.   Halifax handles more 
than half a million incoming shipping containers every year, 
approximately 100,000 of which are in transit for destinations 
in the United States.

SCREENING REGULATIONS ON U.S.-BOUND EXPORTS 
 
REF:  A. STATE 036401,  B. 02 Halifax 0091 
 
1. SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Nova Scotia officials have raised with CG the 
deep concerns in Atlantic Canada over the potential that USG 
border screening systems, including the regulations emanating 
from the Bioterrorism Act, will hurt the large volume of 
agricultural and fish exports from this region to the United 
States.  END SUMMARY 
 
3. (SBU) Nova Scotia\'s Agriculture and Fisheries Minister, 
Gordon Balser, accompanied by a group of economic officials from 
various departments of the provincial government, requested a 
meeting with CG on February 7 to express concerns about the 
potential impact of the USGQs new bio-terrorism preparedness 
measures on Atlantic CanadaQs exports to the United States. 
 
4. (SBU) Both the governments and private companies in this part 
of the country have heard fairly dire warnings from industry 
groups about what they fear will be cumbersome new requirements 
that will result from the Public Health Security and 
Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.  For 
example, the Fisheries Council of Canada held a seminar last 
month in Halifax spelling out new requirements for shippers to 
register with the FDA, to provide exhaustive \"traceability\" 
records for exported goods, and to provide eight hours advance 
notice whenever a truckload of agricultural or fish products is 
about to approach the U.S. border. 
 
5. (SBU) Balser explained that, based on what they have heard 
from the Fisheries Council and other groups, Nova Scotia 
exporters are concerned about the potential for these new 
paperwork requirements to cause long delays at the land border 
crossings.  These delays, he postulated, might be compounded 
once the USG finishes putting in place new secure ID and 
biometric systems for screening people entering the United 
States.  The Minister noted that USG border programs such as 
FAST, NEXUS, and C-TPAT are not as well understood in Atlantic 
Canada as they are in other parts of the country because they 
have not been employed as much here until now.  He begged for 
the USG to consider setting up pilot projects for Atlantic 
exporters that would enable companies that ship goods frequently 
to get their drivers properly credentialed early. 
 
6. (SBU) Nova Scotia officials are particularly concerned about 
fish and agricultural products, which constitute the majority of 
Atlantic exports to the United States and are the lifeblood of 
many small communities.  Minister Balser, who happens to be the 
legislative representative one such community, worries that 
delays would be devastating for perishable food products such as 
live lobsters and fish with a short shelf life. 
 
7. (SBU) The Minister made no secret of his distrust of Ottawa 
on these issues.  He observed that the Canadian federal 
government does not appreciate the impact of new border measures 
on Atlantic Canada and has little willingness to help the region 
participate in these pilot programs.  He told CG that this was 
yet another case of Ottawa politiciansQ \"dismissive attitude\" 
toward protecting the interests the interests of the 
economically depressed Atlantic region.  With that, Balser said 
his province must look at mounting its own campaign to see the 
region get fast-track participation in any new USG border 
programs. 
 
8. (SBU) CG provided Minister Balser and the other officials 
with the information concerning the Bioterrorism Act contained 
in ref A, and promised to deliver a more extensive briefing on 
FAST/NEXUS/C-TPAT in the near future. 
 
9. (SBU) COMMENT:  Atlantic officials perennially complain about 
neglect from Ottawa, but in this case they perceive strongly 
that other regions of Canada have benefited from preferential 
treatment in terms of advance participation in new USG border 
screening programs.  New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord has 
sought to bring pilot projects to land border crossings in his 
province (ref B), but has not up to his point received much 
support from regional counterparts.  BalserQs comments suggest 
that a regional push from officials of all four provinces might 
be forthcoming.

SUBJECT:  U.S. CUSTOMS AT HALIFAX PORT 
 
 
1.   SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED Q ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.   SUMMARY: Canada Customs and Revenue Agency  (CCRA) 
officials in Halifax are pleased with the cooperation they 
have enjoyed over the past year with the U.S. Customs 
inspectors assigned to work at the Halifax port.  Since U.S. 
Customs began assigning inspectors to Halifax on a rotating 
basis last March, CCRA has scrutinized nearly 500 U.S.-bound 
marine shipping containers specifically at the request of 
their U.S. colleagues, in addition to the 3,000-3,500 
containers that CCRA normally inspects for its own reasons. 
Local CCRA officials would welcome a permanent U.S. Customs 
presence here.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.   On February 25, CG visited the customs facility where 
two U.S. Customs inspectors are working with their Canadian 
counterparts in identifying U.S.-bound marine shipping 
containers that merit closer scrutiny and inspection.  Both 
the U.S. Customs personnel and the CCRA officials with whom 
they work spoke highly of the collaboration that has evolved 
since last March, when U.S. first sent two inspectors here. 
The U.S. Customs inspectors commented that they receive full 
cooperation from CCRAQs container targeting unit and have 
never had a problem persuading CCRA to inspect a U.S.-bound 
container at their request.  The targeting unit is co- 
located with the inspection facility. 
 
4.   Senior CCRA officials in Halifax have told CG that this 
arrangement has worked out very well thus far.  They noted 
that it has been beneficial for both sides that the U.S. 
Customs people have access to a different database and can 
therefore make slightly different decisions about which 
containers coming in to Halifax port might be suspicious. 
They insisted that CCRA is happy to isolate and inspect any 
container flagged by the U.S. inspectors and that there have 
been no jurisdictional problems.  Since the U.S. inspectors 
arrived, CCRA has inspected almost 500 U.S.-bound shipping 
containers at their request.  The CCRA officials observed 
that this statistic compares favorably with those at the 
ports of Montreal and Vancouver, both of which have a higher 
volume of U.S.-traffic.  Halifax annually inspects a total 
of over 3,000-3,500 containers that have come to the 
attention of CCRA or other law-enforcement agencies for 
various reasons. 
 
5.   Our local CCRA contacts believe it would be 
advantageous if U.S. Customs decided to make its presence at 
Halifax port permanent.  They pointed out that each newly 
assigned TDY inspector over the past year has had to spend 
some time developing the necessary personal working 
relationships with Canadian counterparts, as well as having 
to undergo a certain learning curve with regard to CCRA 
practices and procedures.   Assigning U.S. Customs people 
here on a more permanent basis would solve this problem. 
Co-locating U.S. inspectors with the Canadian 
targeting/inspection unit makes sense, they argued, and 
might be even more feasible on a long-term basis once the 
unit moves to a new, larger facility  this spring.

SUBJECT:  NOVA SCOTIA ENERGY MINISTER STILL OPTIMISTIC 
ON DEEP PANUKE GAS PROJECT 
 
REF:  02 Halifax 0307 
 
1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. 
 
2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Nova Scotia provincial government remains 
optimistic about the future of the Deep Panuke offshore 
natural gas project despite EnCanaQs decision to halt work 
for the time being.  The province is eager to persuade USG 
officials of Atlantic CanadaQs importance in ensuring a 
secure, long-term energy supply for North America.  (END 
SUMMARY) 
 
3.  (SBU) Nova ScotiaQs newly appointed Energy Minster, Ernie 
Fage, focused on the Deep Panuke offshore natural gas 
project during his first meeting with CG on February 27. 
Fage acknowledged that he has taken over the energy 
portfolio from his predecessor Gordon Balser at a difficult 
time for the province\'s energy sector.  Just the previous 
day, federal and provincial regulators agreed to 
discontinue their public review of the Deep Panuke project 
at the request of the projectQs principal sponsor, the 
EnCana Corporation of Calgary.  The company announced on 
February 14 that it was asking for the \"time-out\" while it 
undertook a comprehensive review of the project.  Company 
officials cited concerns over the availability of 
sufficient gas reserves to make the project economically 
viable. 
 
4.  (SBU) Minister Fage admitted that the main problem lies 
in disappointment in some quarters over the lower-than- 
expected quantities of new, exploitable natural gas 
reserves discovered thus far in the areas offshore Nova 
Scotia.  Estimates of the recoverable portion of this gas 
field have been declining from the 1.2 trillion cubic feet 
of gas originally projected.  EnCana\'s had initially hoped 
to begin supplying gas to the U.S. northeast by 2006, but 
the company now has no idea of the new start-up date. 
 
5.  (SBU) Despite the obvious bad news to Nova Scotia\'s 
developing energy sector, Minster Fage said he agreed with 
industry observers that that EnCana\'s delay was primarily a 
business decision.  The minister acknowledged that 
uncertainty over the size of the gas reserves was making 
Deep Panuke less attractive than EnCana\'s other investments 
elsewhere, such as in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. 
He also speculated that the company, which just came into 
existence last year through a merger between PanCanadian 
and Alberta Energy Company, may still be sorting out its 
priorities and moving those with a quicker return on 
investment to the top of the list. 
 
6. (SBU) Taking a long-term view, Fage echoed comments by many 
in the industry who believe that Deep Panuke may follow the 
model of the Sable Island project, whose development 
languished in the doldrums for years before the discovery 
of new reserves and changing economic conditions propelled 
the project into the production phase.  Just how long the 
delay will be for Deep Panuke, the Minster predicted, might 
depend on world energy prices.  Equally important will be 
the results of EnCana\'s various exploratory drilling 
activities in the Nova Scotia offshore areas, as well as 
those of other companies determined to find economically- 
viable natural gas there.  Fage said he expected that there 
will be 8-10 new exploratory wells this year, bringing the 
total value of work commitments to the level of C$1.5 
billion. 
 
7.  (SBU) COMMENT:  While some of FageQs comments about Deep 
Panuke may reflect the provinceQs forced optimism, the 
overall prospects for the offshore energy sector in 
Atlantic Canada remain very strong.  The Minister displayed 
eagerness to get the message across to senior USG officials 
that this region can play a vital role in producing secure, 
long-term energy supplies for North America.  Fage will be 
traveling to Houston and Washington in March, then 
attending the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston in 
May.  CG offered to help arrange appointments for him with 
appropriate USG federal officials.  The Minister promised 
to get back to us with his schedule.  (END COMMENT)

2.  (SBU) AS REPORTED VIA E-MAILS OVER THE PAST WEEK, CONGEN 
HALIFAX HAS BEEN THE SITE OF THREE MAJOR (BY ATLANTIC CANADA 
STANDARDS) ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF 
HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ.  ALL THREE PROTESTS---ORGANIZED BY A 
COMBINATION OF MILITANT STUDENT GROUPS, CHURCH GROUPS, AND THE 
SELF-STYLED \"HALIFAX PEACE COALITION\"---TOOK THE FORM OF MARCHES 
ACROSS TOWN, ENDING UP IN FRONT OF THE OFFICE BUILDING HOUSING 
THE CONGEN.  ALL THREE TOOK PLACE WITHOUT VIOLENCE, ALTHOUGH 
DEMONSTRATORS ENGAGED IN STRONG ANTI-U.S. RHETORIC AND BURNED 
U.S. FLAGS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. 
 
3. (SBU) BOTH HALIFAX REGIONAL POLICE AND THE ROYAL CANADIAN 
MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP) TRACKED THE DEMONSTRATIONS CAREFULLY AND 
PROVIDED PROTECTION TO CONGEN OFFICES, PROVIDING 20-30 UNIFORMED 
POLICE OFFERS AT EACH EVENT.  RCMP CONTACTS HAVE KEPT CG AND PSO 
INFORMED IN DETAIL OF THESE AND OTHER PLANNED PROTEST 
ACTIVITIES. 
 
4. (SBU) THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION OCCURRED AT 1400 HOURS (LOCAL) 
ON THURSDAY, MARCH 20.  APPROXIMATELY 100 PROTESTERS ARRIVED AT 
THE FRONT ENTRANCE TO THE OFFICE BUILDING (PURDYQS TOWER II) IN 
WHICH CONGEN HAS ITS NINTH-FLOOR OFFICES.  THE DEMONSTRATORS 
CHANTED, PLAYED DRUMS, AND SOUNDED AIR HORNS FOR ABOUT 25 
MINUTES BEFORE DEPARTING.  THE PROTESTERS ALSO THREW BAGS OF 
WATER-SOLUBLE PAINT AT THE FRONT ENTRANCE AREA AND DREW FIGURES 
AND GRAFFITI ON THE STREET WITH CHALK.  BUILDING MAINTENANCE 
QUICKLY CLEANED THE AREA. 
 
5. (SBU) THE SECOND DEMONSTRATION OCCURRED LATER THE SAME DAY AT 
1755 HOURS.  MORE THAN 600 PROTESTERS ARRIVED AS A GROUP AT THE 
FRONT ENTRANCE TO PURDYQS TOWER II.  THE DEMONSTRATION LASTED 
ABOUT ONE HOUR AND FEATURED SEVERAL SPEAKERS.  THE CROWD WAS 
WELL BEHAVED AND DEPARTED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SPEECHES. 
 
6. (SBU) THE THIRD DEMONSTRATION TOOK PLACE ON SATURDAY, MARCH 
22.  PROTESTERS ARRIVED WITH POLICE ESCORT AT THE FRONT OF 
PURDYQS TOWER II AT ABOUT 1400 HOURS.  PROTESTERS ORGANIZED BY 
THE \"HALIFAX PEACE COALITION\" MARCHED ACROSS TOWN CARRYING IRAQI 
FLAGS, ANTIWAR BANNERS, AND ANTI-U.S. PLACARDS.  SEVERAL 
DEMONSTRATORS BURNED A LARGE U.S. FLAG WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN 
FRONT OF THE CONSULATE.  STUDENT LEADERS, CHURCH LEADERS, AND 
MEMBERS OF THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY DELIVERED SPEECHES AND CHANTING 
SLOGANS EXCORIATING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, IN SOME CASES USING 
FAIRLY VIRULENT LANGUAGE.  SEVERAL TV NEWS CREWS COVERED THE 
EVENT.   MEDIA REPORTS DESCRIBED THE CROWD AS NUMBERING BETWEEN 
1,000-2,000, BUT WE CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATE THE TOTAL NUMBER AT 
CLOSER TO 600-800. 
 
7. (SBU) INDICATIONS OF A MAJOR ANTI-U.S. PROTEST AT THE CG 
RESIDENCE FORCED CONGEN HALIFAX TO CANCEL A LARGE RECEPTION WE 
WERE SCHEDULED TO HOLD THERE ON MARCH 25.  POLICE AND UNIVERSITY 
OFFICIALS WARNED US THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED CLEAR INDICATIONS 
THAT STUDENT GROUPS WERE ORGANIZING THEMSELVES TO CONDUCT A 
MAJOR PROTEST AT THE CG RESIDENCE TO DISRUPT OUR RECEPTION. 
SOME OF THE 30 LOCAL ART STUDENTS WHO WERE TO ATTEND THE 
RECEPTION AS GUESTS OF HONOR HAD BEEN THREATENED AND PRESSURED 
TO BOYCOTT THE RESIDENCE.  ON THE ADVICE OF THE RCMP, WE 
POSTPONED THE EVENT. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) THESE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE SMALL COMPARED TO THOSE THAT 
HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN LARGER CANADIAN CITIES SUCH AS TORONTO OR 
MONTREAL, BUT SIGNIFICANT BY HALIFAX STANDARDS.  AS IS USUALLY 
THE CASE IN THE MARITIMES, THE PROTESTORS ARE CONDUCTING 
THEMSELVES IN A RESTRAINED, MOSTLY NON-VIOLENT MANNER.  THE FACT 
THAT CONGEN HALIFAX IS LOCATED IN A LARGE OFFICE BUILDING 
(CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC ON WEEKENDS) WHICH ALSO HOUSES DOZENS OF 
OTHER COMPANIES TENDS TO UNDERCUT ANY DANGER OF DIRECT ACTION 
AGAINST OUR OFFICES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT MILITANT STUDENT GROUPS 
AND THE \"HALIFAX PEACE COALITION\" INTEND TO ORGANIZE PROTESTS 
EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON IN FRONT OF THE OFFICE BUILDING HOUSING 
THE CONGEN. 
 
9. (SBU) WE ARE COORDINATING CLOSELY WITH THE RCMP, THE HALIFAX 
REGIONAL POLICE, AND OUR OWN BUILDING SECURITY PEOPLE TO 
MINIMIZE ANY RISK.  PSO HAS REVIEWED PROCEDURES WITH THE LOCAL 
CONTRACT GUARD TO CONTROL ACCESS TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE 
CONSULATEQS OFFICE SPACE.  NO PROTESTERS HAVE TARGETED THE CG 
RESIDENCE AS OF YET, BUT RCMP CONTACTS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE 
LOCATION OF THE RESIDENCE IS KNOWN TO LOCAL ANTI-WAR ACTIVISTS.

2.  (SBU) CANADIANS IN THE ATLANTIC PROVINCES, MOST OF WHOM 
CONSIDER THEMSELVES TO HAVE A STAUNCHLY PRO-U.S. WORLD VIEW ON 
MOST ISSUES, ARE DEEPLY DIVIDED OVER THE WAR IN IRAQ.   IN 
DISCUSSIONS DURING THE PAST WEEK WITH A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE 
INCLUDING THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT 
MINISTERS, LOCAL NEWSPAPER EDITORS, A POLITICAL POLLSTER, 
BUSINESSPEOPLE, AND SOME OF OUR KEY MILITARY CONTACTS HERE, CG 
HAS GOTTEN THE IMPRESSION OF A PROFOUNDLY CONFLICTED PUBLIC. 
HALIFAX AND OTHER KEY ATLANTIC CITIES HAVE FAIRLY VOCAL STUDENT 
GROUPS AT THE MAJOR UNIVERSITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN OUTSPOKEN IN 
CRITICIZING THE WAR, AND WHICH HAVE ORGANIZED A NUMBER OF ANTI- 
WAR DEMONSTRATIONS (REFTEL) SINCE THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN STARTED. 
BUT THESE DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE ONLY DRAWN PROTESTERS IN THE 
HUNDREDS, NOT THE THOUSANDS OR EVEN TENS OF THOUSANDS THAT HAVE 
MARCHED ACROSS OTHER, LARGER CANADIAN CITIES.   OF COURSE, 
HALIFAX IS A MEDIUM-SIZED PROVINCIAL TOWN WITH A SMALLER 
POPULATION THAN TORONTO OR MONTREAL, BUT THE LUKEWARM RESPONSE 
TO THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT REFLECTS DEEPER EMOTIONS HERE. 
 
3. (SBU) OUR CONTACTS SAY THAT MOST ATLANTIC CANADIANS HAVE 
SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT ANY POLICY POSITION DICTATED FROM 
OTTAWA THAT PUTS CANADA AT ODDS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  THIS 
PART OF CANADA IS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT IT HAS CLOSE TIES OF 
HISTORY, FAMILY, TRADE, AND CULTURE TO THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED 
STATES.  ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE SHARE THE ANTI-WAR ACTIVISTQSQ 
CONCERNS OVER THE UTILITY AND TIMING OF THIS MILITARY CAMPAIGN 
AND OVER THE PERCEPTION THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS ACTING 
UNILATERALLY WITHOUT U.N. SANCTION, A STRONG CURRENT WITHIN 
LOCAL OPINION MAINTAINS THAT, NOW THAT THE WAR HAS BEGUN, FOR 
BETTER OR WORSE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CANADA TO STAND BESIDE ITS 
U.S. ALLY.  MANY ATLANTIC CANADIANS BELIEVE THAT THE 
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES OVER WHETHER TO INITIATE 
MILITARY ACTION WAS ESSENTIALLY A DISPUTE OVER TACTICS, NOT OVER 
THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ENDING THE INTERNATIONAL THREAT POSED BY AN 
OUTLAW REGIME IN BAGHDAD.    TACTICAL DIFFERENCES, THEY ARGUE, 
SHOULD NOT BE THE CAUSE A SERIOUS RIFT BETWEEN TWO LONGSTANDING 
PARTNERS. 
 
4. (SBU) AMBASSADOR CELLUCCIQS PUBLIC REMARKS YESTERDAY TO THE 
EFFECT THAT AMERICANS ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH CANADAQS FAILURE TO 
SUPPORT THE WAR HAVE GIVEN MANY ATLANTIC CANADIANS A JOLT. 
ALTHOUGH SOME DO APPEAR TO FEEL INSULTED AT SUCH CRITICISM, MANY 
OF OUR CONTACTS HAVE QUIETLY TOLD US THAT THEY BELIEVE THE 
AMBASSADOR WAS RIGHT TO EXPRESS HIS CONCERNS AND TO WARN OF THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES IN THE 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.   WHILE PEOPLE HERE ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
THE RAMIFICATIONS OF U.S. ACTIONS, THERE IS ALSO A PALPABLE 
DISCONTENTMENT WITH THE ACTIONS AND STATEMENTS OF PM CHRETIEN 
AND HIS GOVERNMENT.    ATLANTIC CANADIANS BELIEVE THAT CROSS- 
BORDER COMMERCE AND TOURISM ARE VITAL TO THIS REGION, AND MANY 
FEAR THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ADOPTING POSITIONS THAT 
COULD JEOPARDIZE THESE ESSENTIAL BILATERAL RELATIONS. 
 
 5. (SBU) PUBLIC OPINION IN THE ATLANTIC PROVINCES TENDS TO BE 
MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN ELSEWHERE IN CANADA, PARTLY BECAUSE 
HALIFAX IS HOME TO THE CANADIAN NAVYQS ATLANTIC FLEET AND TO 
MANY MILITARY FAMILIES WHICH HOLD THE U.S. MILITARY FORCES IN 
HIGH REGARD.  REAR ADMIRAL GLENN DAVIDSON, COMMANDER OF CANADIAN 
NAVAL FORCES HERE, CONFIDED TO CG TODAY THAT THERE IS FAIRLY 
STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE WAR WITHIN THE MILITARY SERVICES.  MANY 
OF HIS NAVY OFFICERS AND ENLISTED PERSONNEL FEEL THAT THEY 
SHOULD BE PART OF THE WAR EFFORT.  ACCORDING TO RADM DAVIDSON, 
THE CANADIAN MILITARY ATTACHES THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE TO 
DEVELOPING ITS \"INTEROPERABILITY\" AND COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. 
MILITARY SERVICES, AND MANY MILITARY PEOPLE HERE FEAR THAT 
CANADAQS REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN IRAQ WILL DAMAGE THAT CLOSE

SUBJECT:  CANADIAN TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD 
RELEASES FINAL REPORT ON CRASH OF SWISSAIR FLIGHT 111 
 
 
1. THE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD OF CANADA (TSB) TODAY RELEASED 
ITS FINAL REPORT ON SWISSAIR FLIGHT 111, WHICH CRASHED OFF THE 
COAST OF NOVA SCOTIA ON SEPTEMBER 2, 1998, KILLING ALL ABOARD, 
INCLUDING 103 AMERICAN CITIZENS.  THIS REPORT MARKS THE 
CONCLUSION OF THE TSB\'S LONGEST AND MOST EXTENSIVE CRASH 
INVESTIGATION EVER, CONDUCTED AT A TOTAL COST OF C$ 57 MILLION. 
 
2. THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT THE ONBOARD FIRE WHICH LED TO THE CRASH 
OF SWISSAIR 111 STARTED IN A HIDDEN OVERHEAD AREA ON THE 
STARBOARD SIDE OF THE PLANE JUST ABOVE AND AT THE REAR OF THE 
COCKPIT AREA.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WAS AN ARCING EVENT IN THE 
AIRCRAFT\'S ELECTRICAL WIRING.   THE TSB PINPOINTED ONE PARTICULAR 
SECTION OF WIRING FROM THE AIRCRAFT\'S IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT 
SYSTEM FOR BUSINESS CLASS PASSENGERS AS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
INITIAL ARCING EVENT, THOUGH THEY COULD NOT SAY WITH CERTAINTY 
THAT THE ARCING THAT OCCURRED THERE WAS IN FACT THE LEAD EVENT. 
THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT ARCING ALSO OCCURRED AT OTHER POINTS IN 
THE WIRING FOR THE IN FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WHICH WERE NOT 
RECOVERED, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ISOLATE THE LEAD ARCING EVENT. 
THIS ARCING IGNITED THE METALLIZED POLYETHELENE TEREPHTHALATE 
(MPET) MATERIAL ON THE INSULATION BLANKETS ABOVE THE CEILING OF 
THE RIGHT REAR COCKPIT AREA.  THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT THE MPET 
BLANKETS WERE EXCESSIVELY FLAMMABLE AND THAT ABSENT THE PRESENCE 
OF FLAMMABLE MATERIAL IN THE VICINITY OF THE INITIAL ARCING 
EVENT, THE DISASTER WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED. 
 
3. THE TSB NOTED THAT FIRE/SMOKE DETECTION AND SUPPRESSION 
DEVISES WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE AREA WHERE THE FIRE STARTED, AND 
WERE NOT REQUIRED AT THAT TIME.  THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT THE 
FLIGHT CREW DID NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY TOOLS, PROCEDURES, OR 
TRAINING TO LOCATE AND ELIMINATE THE FIRE BEFORE IT BECAME 
UNCONTROLLABLE.  THE TSB ALSO CONCLUDED THAT AIR CIRCULATION 
CHARACTERISTICS ABOARD THE AIRCRAFT VENTED SMOKE AWAY FROM THE 
CREW INITIALLY.  THIS CONTRIBUTED TO A DELAY IN RECOGNIZING THE 
EXTREMELY SERIOUS NATURE OF THE SITUATION, AND LED THEM INITIALLY 
TO ERRONEOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THE SMELL THEY DETECTED WAS THE 
RESULT OF AN ANOMALY IN THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM INSTEAD OF AN 
ONBOARD FIRE. 
 
4. HOWEVER, THE TSB ALSO CONCLUDED THAT AN ACCURATE EARLY 
ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION WOULD STILL NOT HAVE GIVEN THE CREW 
OF SWISSAIR 111 SUFFICIENT TIME TO EXECUTE A SAFE EMERGENCY 
LANDING IN HALIFAX.  THE TSB CONCLUDED THAT, GIVEN IDEAL 
CONDITIONS, THE EARLIEST MOMENT THAT SWISSAIR 111 COULD HAVE 
LANDED WAS 22:27 LOCAL TIME.  HOWEVER, THE ONBOARD FIRE RESULTED 
IN A RAPID DETERIORATION OF FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEMS IN THE COCKPIT 
AT 22:25.  THE TSB THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT THE CREW WOULD HAVE 
LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT SHORT OF THE RUNWAY EVEN IF THEY HAD 
ACTED IMMEDIATELY TO EXECUTE AN EMERGENCY LANDING AT THE MOMENT 
THEY FIRST SMELLED SMOKE. 
 
5. IN ADDITION TO THE 14 AVIATION SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS ALREADY 
MADE IN THE COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, THE TSB RELEASED AN 
ADDITIONAL NINE RECOMMENDATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR FINAL 
REPORT.  THESE RECOMMENDATIONS DEAL WITH TESTING AND FLAMMABILITY 
STANDARDS FOR INSULATION MATERIALS, WITH AIRCRAFT ELECTRICAL 
SYSTEMS INCLUDING CERTIFICATION OF ADD-ON ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS FOR 
COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CAPTURE AND STORAGE 
OF IN FLIGHT DATA. 
 
6. THE TSB OFFICIALS PRESENT EMPHASIZED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THEIR 
INVESTIGATION IS TO IMPROVE AVIATION SAFETY AND TO PREVENT FUTURE 
TRAGEDIES, NOT TO ASSIGN BLAME OR LIABILITY FOR THE CRASH OF 
SWISSAIR 111.  THEY EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS 
PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THEIR INVESTIGATION HAVE AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AVIATION SAFETY.  WHETHER THE INFORMATION IN 
THEIR FINAL REPORT WILL PROVIDE ANY MEASURE OF CLOSURE OR 
SATISFACTION FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS OF SWISSAIR REMAINS 
TO BE SEEN.  THE TSB REPORT IS AVAILABLE IN FULL AT:

SUBJECT:  ALIEN SMUGGLING AT HALIFAX PORT 
 
 
1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The port of Halifax is facing a growing 
problem of stowaways, primarily of Romanian nationality, who 
arrive here hidden in shipping containers on board commercial 
freight vessels originating at southern European ports. 
Certain smuggling rings, probably linked to organized crime, 
appear to be exploiting marine shipping to Halifax as their 
preferred means of getting illegal migrants into North America. 
It is unclear how many of these container stowaways are seeking 
to enter the United States as their final destination.  (END 
SUMMARY) 
 
3. (SBU) Over the past several years, Canadian authorities in 
Halifax have discovered increasing numbers of intending 
immigrants arriving as stowaways aboard commercial container 
ships bound from southern European ports.  Contacts in the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and in Citizenship and 
Immigration Canada (CIC) have told Congen that, in 2000, they 
arrested at least 25 persons attempting to enter the country in 
this manner.  By 2002, the number had risen to 42.   Although no 
stowaways have yet been intercepted in Halifax in 2003, it is 
too early in the year to identify a trend because most alien 
smuggling of this type occurs during the warmer months of the 
year.  Local officials also acknowledge that it impossible to 
know how many stowaways arrive in Halifax this way without being 
detected. 
 
4. (SBU) Marine container stowaways arriving in Halifax are 
predominantly Romanian (at least 90 percent), although a small 
number of Moldavians, Bulgarians, and other Eastern Europeans 
have also taken this route.   According to CIC contacts, they 
tend to be males between the ages of 18 and 45.  Most had been 
living and working illegally for some time in other European 
countries (particularly Italy and Spain), usually in 
construction or as unskilled laborers, prior to embarking. 
About 90 percent claim to have been assisted by a smuggler, who 
brings them into the cargo terminal and places them in a 
container prior to loading.  The intending immigrants are 
responsible for bringing their own food, water, toilet 
facilities, and cutting tools.  Fees for this service generally 
range from 500 to 1,500 Euros.  CIC and RCMP officials strongly 
suspect that  these smugglers have ties to organized crime, but 
they have made no progress in identifying which criminal 
organizations are involved. 
 
5. (SBU) Smugglers typically place the intending immigrants in 
40-foot shipping containers loaded with heavy goods such as 
ceramic tile, paper, wine, or cognac.  These containers have 
sufficient empty space inside to accommodate the passengers. 
The smugglers instruct their customers to cut themselves out of 
their containers after about two days at sea, once the vessel is 
far enough out to guarantee that the shipQs captain will not 
turn around to put the stowaways ashore at the port of origin. 
Halifax officials are convinced that these smuggling rings have 
accomplices among the stevedores responsible for loading 
vessels, since the containers with stowaways invariably are 
placed along the outside of a stack, allowing the occupants an 
easy exit from the container. 
 
6. (SBU) In past years, according to Halifax officials, most 
container stowaways had originated from the Italian ports of 
Livorno and Genova.  As recently as late 2001, the RCMP had 
confided to Congen that Italian authorities seemed to show 
little enthusiasm for aggressively combating this type of 
outgoing alien smuggling from their ports.  RCMP and CIC 
contacts, however, now indicate that interest in port security 
measures and cooperation in combating alien smuggling via 
shipping containers has increased markedly among their Italian 
contacts in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.  The RCMP 
believes that port security measures adopted principally to 
combat terrorism are beginning to have a beneficial trickle-down 
effect on attempts to curb this type of illegal immigration. 
 
7. (SBU) As Italian ports are becoming less accessible, our 
contacts say, alien smugglers are shifting their efforts to 
Spain, transforming Barcelona into the preferred port of 
departure for container ship stowaways.  Officials of the RCMPQs 
Immigration and Passport Section returned last week from a visit 
to Barcelona to improve cooperation and coordination with their 
port security counterparts there.  These officials told conoff 
that the Spanish were cooperative and appear to be making major 
strides in tightening security at the port.  They reported that 
new security measures in the port of Barcelona include a network 
of 65 cameras tied to a central monitoring facility, improved 
access IDQs for port workers, the introduction of electronic 
cargo manifests, gamma-ray scanning devices, and improved 
container seals.  RCMP contacts also report the active support 
of the stevedoreQs union, such as by making clear to its 
membership that any complicity in alien smuggling would result 
in the loss of union membership. 
 
8. (SBU) Our contacts are cautiously optimistic that cooperation 
with Italian and Spanish authorities will reverse the trend in 
alien smuggling to Halifax via marine containers.  The RCMP, 
however, fears that the criminal organizations that involved in 
trafficking in illegal immigrants might then simply shift their 
efforts to other European ports with easier access.  They say 
that Lisbon could become a venue for such activity because port 
security there has not improved as quickly or as markedly as in 
Italy and Spain. 
 
9. (SBU) COMMENT:  It is unclear how many of these container 
stowaways are seeking to enter the United States as their final 
destination.  Some of the ships carrying these intending 
immigrants were bound for U.S. ports after leaving Halifax.  We 
will endeavor to get our local police and immigration contacts 
to focus on this question in their future investigations into 
this alien smuggling problem.

SUBJECT:  FDA BIOTERRORISM MEASURES:  NEWFOUNDLAND SEEKS 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR FISH EXPORTS 
 
REF:  Halifax 0027 and previous 
 
1.  SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The province of Newfoundland-Labrador 
believes its exporters of fish and other perishable products 
should get special consideration when the USG implements new FDA 
border measures to combat bioterrorism.  Newfoundland, which 
depends heavily on its export of freshly caught and live seafood 
to U.S. markets, believes that some of the proposed new 
regulations would severely hamper this trade.  Echoing the 
concerns of the other Atlantic provinces (REFTEL), Newfoundland 
is pressing for the USG to adopt a shorter time requirement for 
notification of perishable shipments crossing the border. 
Newfoundland is also seeking a rule change that would exempt its 
large fish-processing companies from the \"one physical location\" 
definition, as well as a reconsideration of the definition of 
\"originating country\".  (END SUMMARY) 
 
3. (SBU) Newfoundland-Labrador\'s Minister of Fisheries made an 
impromptu call on the CG on April 4 to personally relay her 
province\'s apprehensions over future USG regulations emanating 
from the Bioterrorism Act, which will have a significant impact 
on the provinceQs lucrative export of freshly caught and live 
seafood to the United States.  Minister Yvonne Jones, who just 
joined the cabinet of Premier Roger Grimes in February, 
explained that Newfoundland has strong reasons for being 
concerned about the new regulations because it is in a more 
difficult position than any other Canadian province.  Unlike its 
three regional counterparts, Newfoundland\'s fishing industry is 
the mainstay of the province, with a landed value of over C$1 
billion annually.  Of those products, approximately 70 to 80 
percent are exported to the United States, making Newfoundland 
extremely vulnerable to constraints in cross-border shipments. 
 
4. (SBU) Unlike other Atlantic provinces, NewfoundlandQs 
exporters must get their U.S.-bound perishable products first to 
Nova Scotia by ocean ferry before sending them by truck overland 
to the Maine-New Brunswick border.  Severe weather conditions 
often disrupt the ferry schedule, consequently increasing the 
total transit time to the U.S. border.  Minister Jones argued 
that these conditions often make it impossible to estimate 
arrival times of perishable fish products, and that exporters 
would be unable to adhere to new regulations requiring a strict 
24-hour advance notification for shipments arriving at the U.S. 
border. 
 
5. (SBU) The Newfoundland government, more so than its regional 
counterparts, is therefore making a strong case that the FDA 
allow for two categories of products---perishable and non- 
perishable---in determining pre-notification time of imports, 
allowing shorter advance notification for perishable ones. 
Minister Jones also pointed out that the requirement that a U.S. 
agent submit the advance prior notice was additionally 
cumbersome, but she acknowledged that most Newfoundland shippers 
could comply. 
 
6. (SBU) Another major problem, the Minister explained, is that 
the fish-processing industry in Newfoundland is in the hands of 
a few very large companies which operate facilities in several 
different locations in the province.  Often these facilities 
operate under different company names, reflecting the product 
they produce.  As such, each would require separate registration 
as proposed by the draft FDA regulations.  The Minister is 
proposing an amendment to those regulations that would modify 
the \"one physical location\" definition to allow for multi-plant 
operators.  This would enable the large parent companies to 
continue to co-mingle their products regardless of where in the 
province they were produced. 
 
7. (SBU) Finally, Newfoundland would have unique difficulties 
with the draft requirement concerning identification of 
originating country.  Due to ongoing declines in Newfoundland\'s 
groundfishery, companies have to rely on purchases of raw fish 
product \"on the water\" from vessels flagged in a variety of 
countries, predominately Russia and Norway.  All the raw fish, 
however, is handled and processed the same way as domestic 
supplies, subject to the same quality control and safety 
measures.  Consequently, the Minister made a strong case that 
exports be permitted to identify Canada as the originating 
country, instead of listing the country under which the 
harvesting vessel is flagged. 
 
8. (SBU) COMMENT:  NewfoundlandQs predicament, although perhaps 
a bit more dire than that of the other three Atlantic provinces, 
reflects similar concerns about the potentially devastating 
impact of new bioterrorism regulations on Canadian perishable 
exports to U.S. markets.  All four Atlantic premiers have signed 
a joint letter to Deputy PM Manley urging Ottawa to lobby for 
the necessary rule changes with his U.S. interlocutors.  The 
Newfoundland provincial government has also delivered its 
concerns directly to FDA in the form of a letter signed by the 
Minister on March 31.   Newfoundland now joins Nova Scotia in 
having lobbied the CG directly in the hope of getting the 
Ambassador to weight in with senior FDA officials on these 
proposed modifications.   CG responded that the Ambassador and 
the U.S. Mission in Canada are aware of these Canadian concerns, 
which the Fisheries Council of Canada and the Nova Scotia Fish 
PackersQ Association have also raised in the form of feedback to 
the FDA, and that we are confident that FDA will take into 
consideration the modifications proposed by these Canadian 
organizations and by the affected provinces.

----------- 
Summary 
----------- 
1.  The Department of Canadian Heritage hosted a seminar on a 
proposed International Instrument on Cultural Diversity (IICD) 
in Halifax, Nova Scotia, March 27-28, 2003. Most of the 
discussion focused on audiovisual trade issues.  Culture 
ministry officials and NGO representatives argued that a new 
instrument was necessary to promote and preserve their 
countries\' cultural diversity and counteract \"the corrosive 
effects of globalization.\"  The U.S. delegation and trade 
ministry officials in other delegations noted 
that WTO disciplines have proved sufficiently flexible to 
address legitimate cultural concerns in the audiovisual sector. 
(This cable was prepared by Dan Clune and Eliza Koch of 
EB/EPPD/PA, who participated in the Halifax seminar.)  End 
Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
A Focus On Audiovisual 
---------------------- 
2.  Representatives from 20 countries (vast majority from the 
Western Hemisphere), 8 multilateral organizations, and 17 civil 
society organizations participated in the Experts Seminar on 
cultural diversity.  USG attendees included Daniel Clune and 
Eliza Koch of the State Department\'s Economic Bureau and David 
Taylor of the Library of Congress.  The seminar was designed to 
\"further informal discussions and facilitate an exchange of 
views\" on cultural diversity, particularly among trade and 
cultural officials.  Many foreign government representatives who 
were present at the Experts Seminar are also members of the 
informal group of culture ministers called the International 
Network on Cultural Policy (INCP).  In February 2003, the group 
met with United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) Director General Matsuura and asked UNESCO 
to assume responsibility for a cultural diversity instrument the 
INCP had drafted.  Many representatives of the non-governmental 
arm of INCP, called the International Network for Cultural 
Diversity (INCD) also participated in the seminar. 
 
3.  Although the term \"cultural diversity\" embraces concerns 
ranging from the right to express one\'s culture to preservation 
of languages and indigenous artifacts, the discussion was 
focused almost entirely on the rules governing trade in 
audiovisual goods and services.  James Early of the Smithsonian 
Institution, who attended the meeting as an NGO representative, 
told participants they needed to broaden the discussion to 
matters such as cultural diversity within nations and across 
national borders and to the representation of indigenous people 
in cultural institutions and at the seminar itself. 
 
4.  David Taylor of the Library of Congress gave a presentation 
on several U.S. institutions, which are responsible for the 
collection, documentation, preservation, celebration, and 
display of the multi-cultural expressive traditions of the 
United States.  Taylor highlighted the programs of the National 
Endowment for the Arts, Library of Congress, and the Smithsonian 
Institution.  He also explained that state and local 
involvement, as well as NGO participation, play an important 
role in preserving and promoting the cultural diversity of the 
United States.  The USG delegation provided a fact sheet at the 
seminar which previewed the work of the three federal 
institutions mentioned above as well as that of the National 
Endowment for the Humanities, and the State Department\'s 
Ambassador\'s Fund for Cultural Preservation. 
 
-------------------------- 
The Case For an Instrument 
-------------------------- 
5.  Culture ministry officials and NGO representatives at the 
meeting agreed on the need for a Cultural Diversity Convention. 
Jean-Pierre Blais, the Assistant Deputy Minister at the 
Department of Canadian Heritage, opened the meeting by noting 
that, \"Existing global trade rules are based solely on economic 
principles.\"  Gary Neil of the Canadian Conference of the Arts 
said a new agreement was necessary to counteract the \"corrosive 
effect of globalization on culture.\"  David Diaz of UNCTAD 
claimed that \"there was a consensus that the WTO was not the 
appropriate forum for dealing with these issues,\" noting that 
\"there was one dominant player in the world economy which 
controls the distribution of audiovisual goods and services\" and 
that a new instrument would \"protect culture form the 
undesirable effects of trade.\"  Phil Stone from the Department 
of Canadian Heritage cautioned countries against making new 
trade commitments while an instrument was being negotiated. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
A Different Perspective from Trade Ministries 
--------------------------------------------- 
6.  The Canadian government made a conscious effort to include 
officials from trade ministries in the seminar, and those 
officials brought a different perspective to the discussion. 
Michael Brock from the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade noted the need to reconcile domestic 
cultural polices and international trade rules and said that the 
objective could only be met by engaging both culture and trade 
ministries.  State Department official Daniel Clune highlighted, 
in his presentation to the group, the different strategies 
appropriate for addressing different cultural diversity 
concerns.  He suggested that WTO disciplines have proved 
sufficiently flexible to address legitimate cultural concerns, 
and that the WTO is the best forum for addressing the cultural 
concerns surrounding trade in audiovisual goods and services. 
Guillermo Malpica Soto from the Mexican Secretariat of the 
Economy agreed on the flexibility provided by the GATS and urged 
participants to look for complimentarity between trade and 
cultural agreements. 
 
7.  Alberto Luiz Pinto Choelho from the WTO office in the 
Brazilian Ministry of International Relations noted that the 
INCP draft instrument, which would require signatories to 
consult \"when they are called upon to make commitments that 
could put at risk the preservation of cultural diversity,\" could 
subject countries to dispute settlement proceedings in two 
different international organizations.  He emphasized the need 
for any agreement on cultural diversity to have \"complimentarity 
with the GATS\" and suggested that it be negotiated within the 
WTO as a GATS reference paper.  Kimmo Aulake, a Special Advisor 
to the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture and one of the 
drafters of the INCP instrument, responded that the group 
intended to add an article that would state that, \"Nothing in 
this instrument shall affect the rights and obligations of a 
country under other international agreements.\"  However, Philip 
Stone from the Department of Canadian Heritage said that 
consideration of the issue of coherence among international 
agreements must be postponed. 
 
---------------- 
And On To UNESCO 
---------------- 
8.  Frederic Vacheron from UNESCO\'s Division of Cultural 
Policies noted that UNESCO\'s Executive Board would meet in April 
2003 to discuss the proposed international instrument on 
cultural diversity, among other issues.

2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Newfoundland-Labrador government, stung 
by Ottawa\'s decision to shut down the province\'s cod fishery, is 
seeking a constitutional amendment to force the federal 
government to share control of the fishing industry.  (END 
SUMMARY) 
 
3. (SBU) Newfoundland-Labrador\'s Deputy Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs told us on May 14 that his political 
masters are committed to their quest to obtain shared management 
of the fishery in waters off the province, following the federal 
government\'s unilateral decision to end cod fishing there. 
Andrew Noseworthy, a veteran bureaucrat who has served in 
several Newfoundland-Labrador administrations, dismissed the 
notion that current Premier Roger Grimes is exploiting this 
hot-button issue to garner popularity before he calls a 
provincial election.  Noseworthy acknowledged the move does give 
a high-profile opportunity to the governing Liberals. 
Nonetheless, he emphasized that all three political parties in 
the Newfoundland-Labrador House of Assembly voted unanimously to 
support Premier Grimes\' resolution, which called on Ottawa to 
renegotiate its constitutional right to manage the fishery. 
Accordingly, all the parties have obligated themselves to 
support the initiative regardless of the election outcome. 
 
4. (SBU) Noseworthy asserted that any new provincial government 
will pursue the case, noting that the Progressive Conservative 
Party had first sought greater provincial control of the fishery 
in 1979.  Successive PC and Liberal governments have maintained 
that the federal government has failed to lived up to its 
constitutional obligation to manage the fishery in such a way as 
to ensure the continued economic well-being of the province. 
The historical document which Premier Grimes wants to amend is 
the Terms of Union, which brought Newfoundland-Labrador into the 
Canadian Confederation in 1949.  By agreeing to union with 
Canada, Newfoundland-Labrador relinquished control of its 
fishery, accepting the principle of federal supremacy in 
management of the resource. 
 
5. (SBU) While Newfoundland remains committed to this issue, 
Nova Scotia would prefer that its neighbor refrain from 
challenging the status quo.  Peter Underwood, Nova Scotia\'s 
Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, told Congen that 
his province would likely maintain its longstanding refusal to 
support any initiative to give Newfoundland-Labrador a greater 
say in the management of the fishery.  Nova Scotia fishermen 
enjoy historical access to the waters off Newfoundland-Labrador, 
a right that is currently recognized in how Ottawa allocates 
access in the commercial fishery.  As Underwood explained, Nova 
Scotia has had similar battles with Ottawa on fishery management 
issues, but has never believed that revising the existing 
management structure was a viable solution, especially as there 
would be a high political price to pay as well. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT:  Newfoundlanders attach tremendous 
significance to the cod fishery, not only because of its 
importance to the province\'s economy, but also because of the 
vital and highly symbolic role that cod fishing played in the 
history of Newfoundland.  While we hear varying opinions on the 
motives underlying Premier Grimes\' actions with regard to this 
highly emotional issue, constitution-watchers in Atlantic Canada 
agree that the province\'s actions have the potential to open up 
a new round of constitutional debate in the country.  (END

2. (SBU)  Summary:  Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm will serve 
another term in office following this week\'s provincial 
elections, but he will do so as head of a minority government. 
Hamm\'s Progressive Conservative Party lost seats to both the New 
Democratic Party (NDP) and the Liberals, leaving it unable to 
govern with a majority.   Premier Hamm must now scramble to form 
a compromise arrangement with his political foes in order to 
bring some stability to his government.  There are no 
significant implications for the U.S. in this situation, as all 
three parties attach importance to U.S. trade, to the offshore 
energy sector, and to working with us on secure border issues. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (SBU)  Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm and his Progressive 
Conservative Party won a re-election bid on August 5, but voter 
discontent has left them clinging to power.  The second-place 
New Democrats and third-place Liberals made enough gains at the 
expense of the Tories that their combined seats outnumber the 
governing party.  The results (with previous standings in 
parenthesis) were as follows: Progressive Conservatives 25 (31), 
New Democrats 15 (11), and Liberals 12 (10).  Looking at the 
popular vote, the Conservatives took 36.3 percent, down 
approximately 3 percent from their 1999 performance, the 
Liberals 31.4 percent, and the NDP 31.0.  The campaign was a 
tough fight for all three parties, focusing on local 
voter-sensitive issues as health care, high insurance costs and 
fiscal responsibility. 
 
4.  (SBU)  The immediate challenge for the Hamm government will 
be to work with official opposition leader Darrel Dexter of the 
NDP and Liberal leader Danny Graham to negotiate stable, 
functional arrangements for a minority government.  Although the 
Premier has ruled out naming members of the opposition parties 
to any of his cabinet portfolios, he will nonetheless have to 
work out compromises with those parties in order to get 
legislation through the Assembly. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  Although this election yielded no big winners, it 
does represent significant advancement for the New Democrats. 
Over the last three provincial elections in Nova Scotia, the NDP 
has moved from the role of marginal player on the edge of the 
political stage to a position of influence in the spotlight. 
Party strategists are already assessing what impact these 
provincial gains will have on the party\'s chances in the next 
federal election campaign.  The NDP currently holds four of the 
Atlantic region\'s 32 seats in the House of Commons, and the 
August 5 results will boost the party\'s stature among the 
electorate.  NDP leader Dexter\'s immediate challenge will be 
judging how far he can go in keeping his commitment to cooperate 
with the Conservative Hamm government, without selling out his 
leftist base. 
 
6.  (SBU)  All three of the major Nova Scotia political parties 
attach importance to U.S. trade, to the offshore energy sector, 
and to working with us on a secure border.  None has expressed 
any grievance or taken issue with the United States in any 
particular area.  Foreign involvement in the offshore energy 
sector was not even mentioned on the campaign trail, and NDP 
leader Dexter has made it clear he has no particular ax to grind 
on that subject.  A minority Hamm government is therefore 
unlikely to have a different impact on areas of concern to the 
USG than did the majority Hamm government.  END COMMENT.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1.  (U)  Nova Scotia\'s House of Assembly session opened 
September 25.  The Speech from the Throne which laid out the 
government\'s agenda began on a conciliatory note; Premier Hamm\'s 
Conservative party is two seats shy of a majority and will need 
cooperation from the Liberals and NDP to govern.  \"We all want 
minority government to work,\" Lieutenant-Governor Myra Freeman 
said.  The speech noted that the province faces a number of 
challenges -- improving health care and increasing economic 
competitiveness were at the top of the list -- and promised 
appropriate investments and tax cuts as the way to address them. 
 
2.  (U)  Along with a pretty standard call for Ottawa to provide 
the province with more money for health care, the Throne Speech 
announced that the government planned to introduce legislation 
lowering automobile insurance rates 20 percent.  A precise 
mechanism for doing this was not spelled out, but the speech 
(and previous leaks to the press) indicated that the government 
is looking at a combination of price and claim controls to 
achieve the 20 percent reduction.  The speech also announced 
plans to cap property tax assessment increases and to provide 
relief to voluntary organizations from \"frivolous and 
unwarranted legal claims.\" 
 
3.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Conventional wisdom is that this minority 
government will last about a year.  In the near term  no one 
wants to force another election, and Premier Hamm is in a 
reasonably strong position with 25 out of 52 seats.  But the 
opposition parties will inevitably begin to chafe if the Premier 
is able to claim credit for, and improve his party\'s support 
with, populist measures like insurance rate reductions and 
property tax caps.  On the other hand, there\'s no guarantee that 
either measure will be particularly effective or 
well-implemented, and the Liberals and NDP may be able to 
improve their own standing simply by biding their time.  END

REF: HILL - OPS CENTER TELCONS 9/28 AND 29 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  Hurricane Juan crashed through Nova Scotia and 
Prince Edward Island during the late evening/early morning of 
September 28/29, leaving two dead, two missing and millions of 
dollars in property damage.  We have no reports of AMCIT deaths 
or injuries.  Consulate is open to the public but will be at 
reduced staffing levels, probably for the remainder of the week. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Hurricane Juan made an unwelcome visit to Nova Scotia and 
Prince Edward Island September 28/29.  The storm killed two, 
downed trees and power lines and did millions of dollars worth 
of property damage.  Two fishermen are also missing.  We have no 
reports of AMCIT deaths or injuries.  Coastal areas and moored 
boats were particularly hard-hit; a number of buildings suffered 
extensive damage when high winds ripped off roofing materials 
and allowed rain to flood in.  Several hundred thousand people 
and businesses were left without power.  Telephone lines seemed 
to do better in the storm than power lines, so some people still 
have phone service at home.  Although the cell phone system was 
overwhelmed at several points on September 29 on the whole it 
functioned reasonably well. 
 
3.  Cleanup efforts are underway, but the power company cautions 
that it may be the end of the week before many people have their 
electricity restored.  Maine\'s Governor Baldacci called Nova 
Scotia Premier Hamm in the wake of the storm to offer 
assistance; power line repair crews from Maine will be arriving 
to assist their Nova Scotia Power counterparts.  New Brunswick 
has also sent repair crews to Nova Scotia and PEI.  600 military 
personnel have been assigned to cleanup operations.  Halifax\'s 
downtown core has electricity and public transport has resumed 
on a limited schedule.  Hospitals are open although many 
elective procedures are being postponed.  Municipal, provincial 
and federal governments have told non-emergency personnel to 
stay home to keep roads clear for cleanup crews. 
 
4.  CONSULATE OPERATIONS:  We have been in touch with all but 
one Consulate staff member; all are safe, although only one has 
electricity as of Tuesday morning and several do not have phone 
service.  Main power was out until the afternoon of September 29 
in the office tower where the Consulate is located, but Consul 
was able to verify that there was no damage to our facility and 
that alarms were operating on battery power.  With power now 
restored we have re-opened for business but will operate at 
reduced staffing until hazards are cleared from the roads and 
travel becomes safer for our personnel.  We anticipate resuming 
full operations NLT October 6.  Government-owned Consul 
General\'s residence was hemmed in by fallen trees but suffered 
no damage in the storm, although it has been without power since 
about 11:30PM Sunday night.  Liaison with RCMP protection and 
technical services branches has been excellent throughout the 
emergency.

1.  (U)  Prince Edward Island Premier Pat Binns won a third 
consecutive majority in the province\'s September 29 election. 
Binns\'s Progressive Conservatives took 23 of the 27 seats in the 
legislature.  The Liberal Party improved its standing in the 
house dramatically, but from a low base: the Liberals went from 
one MLA to four, including new party  leader Robert Ghiz.  Voter 
turnout, despite Hurricane Juan, was over 80%. 
 
2.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Premier Binns is well-known to Consulate 
and Embassy staff and we not anticipate any significant changes 
in PEI policy on issues that could affect relations with the 
U.S.  The high voter turnout, in the wake of a major storm that 
did extensive damage across the province, is a remarkable 
comment on the PEI electorate\'s intense interest in politics. 
PEI Liberals are no doubt encouraged by their 300% increase in 
seats, but Robert Ghiz has a tough fight ahead of him to try to 
bring his party back to government.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: PICKING UP THE PIECES AFTER HURRICANE JUAN 
 
REF: HALIFAX 308 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED --  PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1.  (U)  Nine days after Hurricane Juan, life in Nova Scotia and 
Prince Edward Island has largely returned to normal, although 
several thousand people still remain without power in a number 
of hard-hit areas, including some near the center of Halifax. 
While Juan\'s human toll was relatively small -- two deaths 
directly attributable to the storm and three indirectly caused 
when a candle started a fire in a house without electricity -- 
the economic impact is still being added up.  Premier John Hamm 
told the provincial legislature that he expects the damage toll 
to be in the range of C$100 million (US$75 million), although 
that number could well climb as more detailed assessments are 
made.  The Royal Bank\'s Senior VP responsible for Atlantic 
Canada, Wayne Bossert, told Consul General that the overall 
effect of the storm on regional GDP growth could be slightly 
positive, with business and farm losses more than 
counterbalanced by the stimulative effect of rebuilding efforts. 
 In Bossert\'s view the level of insurance coverage will 
ultimately determine whether Juan adds or subtracts a percentage 
point or so from Atlantic Canada\'s economic growth rate for the 
year. 
 
2.  (U)  Harder to assess and repair than damage to homes, farms 
and businesses will be the impact on the ambience and quality of 
life in Halifax, Charlottetown and other areas caused by the 
wholesale uprooting of trees.  Halifax\'s Point Pleasant Park, 
for example, was transformed overnight from a leafy refuge to a 
tangle of downed hardwoods.  News coverage does not really 
capture the full extent of the damage done to parks and some of 
the city\'s older tree-lined neighborhoods.  While wood carvers 
may see a silver lining to the storm due to abundant supplies of 
timber in the near term, the vast majority of residents and 
visitors will be worse off until new maples and oaks have had 
time to grow and replace those that have been lost. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Politically, the seeming indifference of Ottawa to 
the effect of the storm on Nova Scotia and PEI could exacerbate 
a feeling in the Atlantic Provinces that no one in the rest of 
Canada pays much attention to what goes on here.  Liberal 
leader-to-be Paul Martin visited Nova Scotia shortly after the 
hurricane, but the absence of senior government officials and 
particularly the Prime Minister has been -- fairly or not -- 
noted and commented on unfavorably.  On the positive side, the 
cleanup efforts of hundreds of Canadian military personnel have 
gone down well with the general public, as has the work of power 
line and tree trimming crews from Maine.  There have even been 
reports of arriving cruise ship passengers -- many from the U.S. 
-- volunteering to help with cleanup efforts. 
 
4.  (U)  CONSULATE OPERATIONS:  Response of Consulate staff to 
this crisis has been outstanding.  The office fortunately 
suffered no damage in the storm and we were able to open to the 
public on September 30 after power was restored.  Staff members 
-- many of whom had no electricity at home for much of the week 
-- skirted fallen trees and downed power lines to get into work; 
we have been operating at full strength since October 1.

TAGS: PGOV, CA, Conservative Party 
SUBJECT: PRELIMINARY REACTION TO PROPOSED MERGER OF CA AND TORY 
PARTIES:  TALK OF A CREDIBLE OPPOSITION FORCE AND A PROVINCIAL 
PREMIER 
 
1.  News of the proposed merger of the Canadian Alliance and 
Progressive Conservative Parties is getting mixed reaction 
throughout Canada\'s four Atlantic Provinces.  Most local 
representatives of the two parties appear optimistic that the 
tentative merger will actually work and will result in a new 
party capable of acting as an effective opposition to the 
governing Liberals.  Nonetheless, the predictions are that this 
merger process will be a long one and would not be finished in 
time before the next federal election.  Premier Lord\'s deputy 
communications director, Robert Batherson, told CG, visiting PAO 
and Montreal BPAO that he was optimistic about the new party on 
the federal level, but did not expect it to have an effect on 
Liberal dominance of federal politics.  From a provincial 
standpoint, he said, there would be little impact on Nova Scotia 
and other provinces.  In addition to the time factor, regional 
pundits are also emphasizing that the new party will have to 
find a way to deal with certain CA policies which have been a 
tough sell here in Atlantic Canada.  Chief among these are the 
party\'s goal of seeing reduced federal spending for such 
programs as regional development, so critical to economically 
disadvantaged areas like Atlantic Canada. 
 
2.  Also on the minds of Atlantic Canadians is the question of 
Bernard Lord, the current Tory premier of New Brunswick.  This 
time last year, the Quebec-born and bilingual Lord was under 
intense pressure to seek the leadership of the federal Tory 
party.  Lord declined the invitation principally because he had 
a provincial election to fight the next year.  Lord did in fact 
go to the polls in a June re-election bid, but barely held on to 
power.  With the leadership question re-emerging, the two 
schools of thought are that Premier Lord will want to bail out 
of his minority government situation and move to the federal 
stage; the other, that he will be under just as much pressure at 
home not to abandon his Tory party to face certain death at the 
hands of a highly spirited opposition. 
 
3.  Comment:  As this is just day two in the new CA-PC merger 
plans, most observers are asking for more time to study all the 
angles before coming up with a full analysis of the new look 
party and what it means for Atlantic Canada.  For now though the 
mood seems to be generally a cautious optimism that should the 
new party get its house in order, the country may see a 
formidable opposition to the governing Liberals.  END COMMENT

SUBJECT: HALIFAX PORT AUTHORITY SEES SECURITY AS JOB ONE 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Halifax Port Authority officials stressed 
to Ambassador Cellucci during his recent visit that security has 
been and will continue to be a top priority at the port, whether 
for containers or for cruise ships and their -- mainly American 
-- passengers.  HPA is interested in participating in \"Operation 
Safe Commerce.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU)   Ambassador and Consul General met October 10 with 
the chairman and senior executives of the Halifax Port Authority 
to receive a briefing on port operations and to see at first 
hand how the port is addressing security issues.  Chairman Al 
Abraham and CEO Karen Oldfield stressed that as its business 
grows the HPA sees security -- for containers as well as for 
cruise ships and their passengers -- as a top priority.  VP for 
Marketing Patricia McDermott noted that the port had been 
successful in attracting new shipping business -- total 
containerized cargo was up over 10% from last year -- as well as 
cruise ship visits, which have more than doubled in five years. 
Most of th passengers are Americans. 
 
3.  (SBU)  VP for Operations and Security George Malec said that 
the port\'s focus on security predated September 11, 2001.  Well 
before that time the HPA had a contract with the Halifax 
Regional Municipality to provide police services for the port, 
an arrangement that Malec characterized as unique.  As a result 
of the HPA/HRM agreement, the port has immediate access to the 
full resources of the Halifax police department.  The port also 
coordinates security with Canadian federal government entities 
including the RCMP. 
 
4.  (SBU)  All of the HPA officials stressed their interest in 
ensuring that any U.S. concerns about security at the port were 
resolved promptly.  \"We want you to feel comfortable\" about the 
port, Abraham said.  Malec said that the HPA welcomed the 
presence of U.S. officials to implement the Container Security 
Initiative, and that the VACIS system was operating well. 
Oldfield noted that about 5% of containers coming through 
Halifax were physically screened, a rate she contrasted to 
competitor Montreal\'s level of about 3%.  Oldfield also said 
that the port wanted to be involved in Operation Safe Commerce 
(OSC) if at all possible. 
 
5.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  The port\'s management team is impressive, 
and certainly seems dedicated to addressing any concerns that 
the USG might have about security issues.  HPA\'s willingness to 
participate in port security initiatives such as OSC could prove 
useful as we move U.S.-based innovations abroad.  END COMMENT.

------- 
 
3.  CANADIAN NAVY -- Vice-Admiral Glenn Davidson, commander of 
Canada\'s Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) briefed the 
Ambassador on MARLANT\'s role and force structure, stressing the 
Canadian Navy\'s close association with the U.S. Navy and its 
desire to continue to assist in the war against terrorism and to 
provide unique capabilities such as diesel-electric submarines 
for joint exercises.   Ambassador said that he would continue to 
call for the defense spending necessary for maximum 
interoperability among U.S. and Canadian forces.  He toured the 
Command\'s operations center, as well as the joint Navy/Coast 
Guard/Air Force search and rescue operations center which 
handles over 2,000 distress calls annually.  Ambassador also had 
the opportunity to watch a number of defensive drills on the 
frigate HMCS TORONTO during a tour of the vessel by its captain. 
 
4.  PREMIER HAMM -- Nova Scotia\'s Premier John Hamm briefed the 
Ambassador on damage caused by Hurricane Juan, noting with 
appreciation that the governor of Maine had called to offer any 
help necessary.  Hamm said that he hoped the Prime Minister 
would agree to provide additional funding for disaster relief. 
He asked what could be done at a regional level to improve U.S. 
- Canadian relations.  The Ambassador stressed the need to take 
security issues seriously, citing the positive example of the 
Port of Halifax (reftel).  On energy issues, Premier Hamm said 
he had heard that EnCana was having \"some success\" in 
exploratory drilling, and that he hoped this would help the Deep 
Panuke project go forward.  He also said that he would join 
other premiers on a Team Atlantic trade mission to Washington 
November 2 - 6. 
 
5.  ENERGY CONFERENCE SPEECH -- The Ambassador delivered the 
keynote speech at the Onshore/Offshore Technologies Association 
of Nova Scotia (OTANS) energy conference.  His remarks focused 
on U.S. energy and environmental policies, stressing the need to 
correct misperceptions about both. 
 
6.  STUDENT Q&A -- Dalhousie University students turned out in 
large numbers to hear the Ambassador speak and answer questions 
about U.S. policy.  The students were respectful but critical in 
their questioning and the Ambassador was able to address 
effectively issues such as U.S.-Canada differences on Iraq 
policy, the Arar case, and the gap in perception of security 
threats between the U.S. and some in Canada. 
 
7.  HALIFAX AIRPORT -- Halifax International Airport Authority 
President Reg Milley and Chairman Bernie Miller hosted a dinner 
for the Ambassador.  Preclearance for Halifax was of course on 
the menu, and Milley described HIAA\'s efforts to address 
concerns posed by Bangor, Maine, and its lobbyist in Washington, 
including indemnifying Bangor for lost business and renouncing 
any intention of seeking in-transit preclearance for Halifax. 
According to Milley, Bangor was beginning to accept HIAA\'s 
argument that preclearance could actually be beneficial to 
Bangor because of increased regional traffic. 
 
CAPE BRETON 
----------- 
 
8.  Many of the Ambassador\'s interlocutors in Cape Breton 
stressed the efforts being made to recover from the economically 
disastrous loss of the coal and steel industries, as well as the 
collapse of groundfish stocks.  Preservation -- of language, 
culture and the environment -- was also a recurrent theme. 
 
9.  ISLE MADAME --  On Isle Madame the Ambassador met with a 
number of local businesspeople, educators and community 
activists to get a sense of how this primarily French-speaking 
area was faring in the face of economic changes.  The picture 
that emerged -- in meetings with a cranberry producer, a boat 
builder, seafood processors, the director of the local branch of 
the College de l\'Acadie, and others -- was one of resilience in 
the face of the loss of traditional livelihoods. 
 
10.  Fishermen and onshore processors have switched from cod to 
crab, and while overall employment in the fishery is down, the 
value of the catch is greater now than the early 1990s.  Native 
fishermen have become significant players in the industry in the 
wake of the Supreme Court\'s Marshall decision, and they are now 
buying boats and other equipment from local manufacturers.  One 
such boat builder, Daryl David of Samson Enterprises in Arichat, 
told us that his firm had entered into a partnership with a 
local community to use land and a wharf formerly occupied by a 
fish processor that had closed its doors after the collapse of 
the fishery.  The new Samson facility allows the firm to build 
larger multispecies vessels and local Mi\'kmaq fishermen are 
among the major customers for Samson\'s boats.  Several 
interlocutors told us that the longstanding integration of the 
Francophone, Anglophone and native communities meant that there 
had been less friction over the fishery than in New Brunswick. 
 
 
11.  CULTURAL PRESERVATION -- Both the Acadian and Scottish 
communities were seeking to preserve culture and traditions, 
with notable success.  French language education and culture 
were maintained at institutions like the Centre La Picasse in 
Petit-de-Grat where the Ambassador attended a performance 
featuring local musicians and dancers.  Gaelic is still spoken 
in some sections of Cape Breton, and organizations like the 
Highland Village and the recently established Gaelic College 
seek to preserve that tradition. 
 
12.  BRAS D\'OR LAKES ECOLOGY -- Ambassador received an extensive 
briefing from a local marine biologist on the unique ecology of 
the world\'s largest inland sea, the Bras d\'Or Lakes.  Local 
residents described plans to seek a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve 
designation for a portion of the lakes known as the St. Andrew\'s 
Channel and to build and endow a marine research center on the 
lakes.  They also expressed concerns about seismic exploration 
going on in the region, noting that energy exploration or 
production in the lakes themselves could damage a fragile 
ecosystem. 
 
13.  Both Francophone and Anglophone communities saw education 
as key to moving the island\'s economy in new directions now that 
traditional sources of jobs had disappeared.  The College de 
l\'Acadie and the University College of Cape Breton both offer 
innovative programs and distance education to provide Cape 
Bretoners with skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the 
modern economy. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
14.  The visit was useful in multiple respects, including 
dispelling misperceptions about USG energy, environmental and 
foreign policy in well-attended public fora.  The trip has 
generated favorable comments from Nova Scotians, particularly 
among the Acadian community, and has helped to reaffirm strong 
U.S.-Canadian ties in a region where people tend to view the 
U.S. positively.

SUBJECT: NEWFOUNDLAND-LABRADOR PROVINCIAL ELECTION:  TORY SWEEP ENDS 
LIBERAL HOLD 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  There could be a new round of political wrangling 
between the federal government and the newly elected Progressive 
Conservative Party in Newfoundland-Labrador.  In an October 21 
provincial election campaign, the Tories led by the charismatic 
business leader Danny Williams, solidly toppled a 14-year 
Liberal hold on the province.  A key plank in the successful 
Tory platform was a pledge to seek a new jurisdictional and 
fiscal arrangement with Ottawa over energy and other resource 
development, contentious issues that have the potential to cause 
friction.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  Newfoundland-Labrador Progressive Conservatives, under 
leader Danny Williams, crushed the incumbent Liberal government 
of Premier Roger Grimes in an October 21 provincial election. 
Williams, a successful business leader and lawyer from St. 
John\'s, led his party in capturing 34 of the 48 seats in the 
House of Assembly, a significant gain over their previous 19 
seats.  The Liberals, now the official opposition, saw their 27 
seats reduced to 12, while the largely ineffectual New 
Democratic Party maintained the two seats they held before the 
September 29 election call. 
 
3.  The Tories\' roll to a comfortable majority ended a 14-year 
Liberal hold on the province that saw Grimes as the last of four 
Liberal Premiers since 1989. However, Grimes ascension to the 
Premier\'s office in 2001 had come at a high price through a 
nasty and divisive leadership race.  Election watchers reason 
that Grimes was never was able to heal those wounds.  Coupled 
with a general mood on the part of the electorate for a change, 
the combination spelled defeat even as Grimes was calling the 
election.  Another significant factor was the popularity of Tory 
leader Williams, who like Grimes, took over his party in 2001. 
A Rhodes scholar and successful business leader, Williams is 
credited with single-handedly revitalizing the party and making 
it a formidable alternative to the Liberals. 
 
4. With the focus now on the future, Premier-elect Williams is 
busy putting together his transition team and working out who 
will sit in his cabinet.  Of importance to U.S. interests will 
be Williams\' pick for heading up the Mines and Energy portfolio. 
Given that the Tory platform contains some tough talk on seeking 
greater control and ownership of energy resources and a new 
offshore revenue arrangement with Ottawa, Williams can be 
expected to pick one of the several seasoned veterans he has in 
the Tory caucus to spearhead this task.  While evidently 
pleasing to the electorate, this commitment could very easily 
spark a high profile battle with the federal government and 
other provinces over issues such as jurisdiction of offshore oil 
and gas exploration and development, local content in energy 
projects and increased hydroelectric development in Labrador. 
 
5.  Comment:  In voting overwhelmingly for a change in the 
leadership of the province, the voters in Newfoundland-Labrador 
will be getting just that, a new look in government.  Williams\' 
staff has been telling us all along that the new Premier is 
deeply committed to making some solid improvement in the 
province\'s economic status and wants to try ideas that have 
never been tried before.  Just how much that will affect 
relations with Ottawa and the rest of the provinces is unclear 
at this point.  What is perhaps more certain is Williams\' 
reputation for not backing down on any issue, especially those 
that he views as having the potential to improve 
Newfoundland-Labrador\'s situation relative to the rest of 
Canada.  END COMMENT

RECONSTRUCTION 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  The Pearson Peacekeeping Centre in 
Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, has extensive expertise in training 
military, civilian and police personnel for peace operations in 
a variety of environments, but has as yet received from the 
Canadian government no taskings related to Iraq.  Ottawa could 
be encouraged t make use of the PPC\'s capabilities to provide 
training in support of Iraq reconstruction.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  Consul General, PA Minister-Counselor and Montreal PAO 
recently visited the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre in Cornwallis, 
NS, to meet the PPC\'s staff, look at its facilities and evaluate 
possibilities for future programs together.  Ken Eyre, the Chief 
Operating Officer, briefed us on the courses that the PPC 
offers.  These include focused training courses at the basic and 
advanced levels for military, civilian and police personnel 
involved in peace operations.  The PPC also holds training in 
humanitarian response in peace operations, human rights and 
civil-military cooperation and can custom design courses to the 
specifications of users.  The PPC\'s training is usually not 
country or mission-specific, but is aimed at providing a 
foundation for those involved in various aspects of peace 
operations by distilling lessons learned from many missions. 
 
3.  (U)  The PPC has expanded from it\'s original training 
facility and now offers the majority of its courses in places 
other than Cornwallis.  Much of the training is in Canada, but 
an increasing number of courses are held in other countries, 
including the Middle East.  President Sandra Dunsmore plans to 
open an Ottawa office soon to raise the PPC\'s profile with the 
Canadian government.  In addition to its core courses, the PPC 
can provide in-depth exercises for units going to peace 
operations, capacity building for other training and education 
institutions and an as well support missions in the field with 
on-site training.  German forces bound for Afghanistan 
participated in a command post exercise at the PPC which 
according to the faculty they found very useful.  A small core 
faculty is augmented by subject matter experts from various 
fields and countries.  Most instruction is in English and 
French, but a growing number of courses are offered in Spanish 
as well. 
 
4.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  The PPC has impressive capabilities, and 
has certainly come a long way from it\'s fairly humble origins 
nearly a decade ago.  The expertise and facilities could be 
called upon by the Canadian government for training -- either in 
Cornwallis or in the region -- as part of its contribution to 
Iraq reconstruction.  We share the PPC staff\'s puzzlement at why 
this has not happened to date.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: FDA BIOTERROR RULES:  POSITIVE LOCAL REACTION 
 
REF: HALIFAX 0110 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1. (U) Government and fishing industry officials in Atlantic 
Canada have told us that they are generally pleased with the 
FDA\'s anti-bioterrorism regulations, principally those 
concerning the prior notice time for perishable shipments.  Our 
contacts were deeply concerned that the 24-hour notice time that 
had been originally proposed would have severely hampered the 
cross border seafood trade.  Exporters and New England fish 
buyers processors had mounted an intense lobbying effort that 
ultimately saw the regulations amended to provide for just two 
hours notice. 
 
2. (SBU) New Brunswick\'s Director of Trade, Harry Quinlan, told 
us on November 6 that this amendment was a clear indication that 
the US government officials had made a substantial effort to 
make the regulations more user-friendly.  Moreover, he said he 
and his provincial colleagues and counterparts were very pleased 
that they had the opportunity to make comments on the proposed 
rules before they were finalized. 
 
3. (U) One Nova Scotia fish exporter, Denny Morrow of the Nova 
Scotia Fish Packers Association, echoed Quinlan\'s comments and 
also told us that he was very appreciative of the efforts by 
high level officials including Ambassador Paul Cellucci.  Morrow 
told us he was very pleased by the Ambassador\'s personal 
attention to this issue which he saw as very effective in 
bringing about the notification amendments. 
 
4. (U) Morrow repeated his comments in a local press interview 
with the \"Sou\'wester\" a bi-weekly fishing industry newspaper 
published in Yarmouth Nova Scotia.  In the article headlined, 
\"Anti-Terrorism Bill - Amendments a Boon to Seafood Industry\", 
Morrow was quoted as saying, \"US Ambassador to Canada Paul 
Cellucci also deserves a special note of thanks for making sure 
that the concerns of the seafood industry in Atlantic Canada 
were heard in Washington.\" (A copy of the press article is being 
faxed to Embassy Ottawa and WHA/CAN.) 
 
5. (SBU) Morrow and Quinlan, along with Quinlan\'s Nova Scotia 
counterpart, Greg Bent, have mentioned that they see some minor 
problems with the regulations, such as the added expense of very 
small, family-run fish exporting businesses.  Bent\'s primary 
concern is his belief that there will be no uniformity with 
which border enforcement officials will apply the new 
regulations. Nonetheless, he predicted that with the anticipated 
training, personnel would eventually be \"singing from the same 
song book.\"  Morrow also believes that there will be sufficient 
leniency during the start-up phase that exporters would not 
likely see any measurable impact on their operations. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT:  Overall, there is a general sense of relief 
that the region was able to emerge from this process with all of 
their concerns heard, on the notice time as well as and other 
issues.  With that, New Brunswick\'s Quinlan best summed up the 
reaction here with his comment that clearly what has emerged is 
a reasonable way of moving food produce and fish across the 
U.S.-Canada border.  END COMMENT

AND ISSUES

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Canada\'s four Atlantic Provinces have all 
held provincial elections this year: Newfoundland-Labrador 
(October 21), Prince Edward Island (September 29), Nova Scotia 
(August 5), and New Brunswick (June 9).  With the exception of 
Newfoundland-Labrador, the incumbent governments were all 
re-elected, but there have been some changes in the lineup of 
energy ministers and energy priorities.  Of the four provinces, 
Newfoundland-Labrador will see the most profound changes where 
political veteran Ed Byrne is the new minister.  Byrne will be 
working with his boss, new Progressive Conservative Premier 
Danny Williams, in pushing Ottawa on their key energy priority 
-- enhanced benefits from offshore resource development.  Cecil 
Clarke is Nova Scotia\'s newly named energy minister, and like 
Byrne will focus on greater revenue flows from offshore 
developments.  New Brunswick\'s new energy minister is a rookie 
provincial politician, Bruce Fitch, who will have primarily 
electricity issues on his plate, including the negotiations to 
build a second transmission line to the State of Maine. 
Meanwhile it will be business as usual in Prince Edward Island 
where Minister Michael Currie will continue to oversee issues 
such as access to natural gas and wind energy.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.(U) Newfoundland-Labrador 
--------------------------- 
A.  Political Background:  In the October 21 provincial 
election, the Progressive Conservatives under Leader Danny 
Williams captured 34 of the 48 seats in the House of Assembly. 
The Conservatives\' win overturned a 14-year long reign by the 
Liberals, who were left with 14 seats, and the third place New 
Democrats with their same two seats.  With his comfortable 
majority, Williams and his Conservative party have a solid 
mandate to lead the province for the next four to five years. 
 
B.  Energy Portfolio/Minister: Premier Williams has maintained 
the same ministry structure as the previous Liberal 
administration -- energy matters are in a dual portfolio with 
the mining sector.  The new minister is a political veteran, Ed 
Byrne, and a former leader of the party.  First elected to the 
Newfoundland House of Assembly in 1993, Byrne was re-elected in 
1996, 1999 and in the October election.  While in Opposition, he 
served in several shadow portfolios, and followed energy issues 
closely during the time he was the Leader of the Official 
Opposition.  The 40-year old minister is a skilled, affable 
politician and dedicated to the Premier. 
 
C.  Substantive Energy Issues:  The new Williams government has 
several energy items on its political agenda with the most 
significant the pledge to seek jurisdictional control over 
offshore energy resources.  The government also wants an 
improved revenue sharing agreement from the federal government. 
Further, the government wants to restructure its provincially 
owned utility, Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, either as an 
energy company or alternatively, turn it into a new energy 
corporation to participate in all areas of the offshore oil and 
gas sector.  On the electricity side, the Williams government 
also wants federal help in facilitating negotiations with the 
Province of Quebec over hydroelectricity development in the 
Labrador region and transmission rights across Quebec. 
 
3. (U) Prince Edward Island 
--------------------------- 
A.  Political Background:  Prince Edward Island voters 
re-elected the incumbent Progressive Conservative party in a 
September 29 provincial election.  With Premier Pat Binns at the 
helm, the Conservatives took 23 of the 27 seats in the 
Legislative Assembly, leaving the Opposition Liberals with just 
four seats and the New Democratic party with none.  Like his 
Newfoundland counterpart, Premier Binns has a solid hold on the 
Island political scene for the next four-five years. 
 
B.  Energy Portfolio/Minister/Issues:  Premier Binns has made no 
changes in how his government handles energy matters -- 
responsibility for the sector is a unit within the province\'s 
ministry of Development and Technology.  The Premier also kept 
the same minister in the Department, Michael F. Currie. 
Minister Currie was first elected in 1998 and was re-elected in 
2000 and 2003.  His energy priorities continue to be pursing 
access to Nova Scotia offshore natural gas and further 
development of wind power facilities. 
 
4. (U) Nova Scotia 
------------------ 
A.  Political Background:  The Progressive Conservative party, 
led by Premier John Hamm, is a precarious situation following 
the August 5 provincial election.  The Conservatives won the 
election with their securing 25 seats in the 52-seat Legislative 
Assembly.  However, the combined total of the seats held by the 
second-place New Democrats and third-place Liberals outnumber 
the Conservatives.  (The NDP have formed the Official Opposition 
with their 15 seats and the Liberals have 12.)  Given that 
configuration, the Hamm government is relying on the support of 
the opposition members to get legislation passed in the 
Assembly.  Pundits predict that the support is probably 
short-lived, meaning another election will likely take place 
within two years. 
 
B.  Energy Portfolio/Minister:  Nova Scotia energy matters are 
in a separate and new ministry of energy which Premier Hamm 
created in 2002 from the remnants of the old Nova Scotia 
Petroleum Directorate and from a section of the Natural 
Resources department.  Premier Hamm has picked a relatively 
inexperienced cabinet minister to head up the portfolio, 35-year 
old Cecil Clarke.  Clarke first entered provincial politics in 
2001 and was re-elected in August.  He had one previous cabinet 
posting as minister of economic development. 
 
C.  Substantive Issues: Like Newfoundland-Labrador, Nova Scotia 
is looking to the federal government to give the province more 
revenue from offshore development.  This was the chief item on 
the Premier\'s energy agenda during his first mandate and will 
continue to do so in this second.  Also of importance to the 
Hamm government is supporting future exploration and 
development, protection of offshore workers, and facilitating 
partnerships with foreign companies. 
 
5. (U) New Brunswick 
-------------------- 
A. Political Background:  The incumbent government of 
Progressive Conservative Premier Bernard Lord made a successful 
re-election bid on June 9, 2003.  However, the party emerged 
barely hanging onto enough seats to form a slim majority 
government.  The Conservatives took 28 of the legislature\'s 55 
seats, the Liberals 26 and the New Democratic Party one.  The 
scant majority is making for an uncertain political situation in 
the province, made even more speculative by rumors that Premier 
Lord may resign and move to federal politics.  Lord is touted as 
a top contender to head up the newly proposed Conservative party 
of Canada.  Should Lord decide to go for the party\'s top job, it 
would force a by-election, a contest that ultimately could end 
the Conservatives\' majority. 
 
B.  Energy Portfolio/Minister:  Despite his government\'s 
uncertain future, it is business as usual in the province.  When 
picking his post-election cabinet, Premier Lord decided to 
increase the profile of energy matters in the province by 
creating a separate energy department.  The Premier named rookie 
politician Bruce Fitch to head up the new portfolio that was 
formerly part of the Natural Resources Department.  Elected to 
the Legislature for the first time in the June election, Fitch 
has no legislative experience and was a professional financial 
planner and the mayor of a small town near Moncton before 
entering provincial politics. 
 
C. Substantive issues:  Minister Fitch has a long list of energy 
matters on his plate, mainly those associated with the 
provincially-owned utility, New Brunswick Power (NBP).  The 
utility has continuing financial problems, including a debt that 
has now reached the $3 billion mark.  Fitch is also overseeing 
the opening of the province\'s electrical market to outside 
competition, a development that will remove NBP\'s competitive 
advantage and produce additional fiscal concerns.  Other issues 
are ongoing negotiations to build a second high voltage 
transmission line to the state of Maine, the future of the 
debt-ridden Point Lepreau nuclear power plant, unreliable 
Orimulsion fuel imports from Venezuela, and a possible deal with 
Quebec to expand a power plant in northern New Brunswick.  On 
the oil and gas side, the province\'s chief priority remains 
gaining further access to natural gas, either from offshore Nova 
Scotia or through a proposed LNG plant in the Saint John area. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT:  Of the four provinces, Newfoundland-Labrador 
has the heaviest energy agenda, primarily focused on cutting a 
new deal with the federal government on offshore management and 
revenue sharing.  In a 2001 meeting post had with Danny Williams 
and Ed Byrne, both vehemently asserted what they perceived to be 
the province\'s right to get more benefits from their natural 
resources, primarily in the oil and gas and fisheries sectors. 
Now with Williams as the new Premier and Byrne as his energy 
minister they are poised to start laying the groundwork for this 
new, politically charged campaign. 
 
7.  (SBU) Just how intense or confrontational this new campaign 
becomes will undoubtedly depend more on what changes occur in 
Ottawa after Paul Martin assumes the Prime Minister\'s job. 
Premier Williams has been quite vocal in expressing his optimism 
that Martin\'s ascension to the Prime Minister\'s office will bode 
well for his province.  Williams sees the future prime minister 
as being more open to working with Newfoundland-Labrador and the 
other provinces, with Williams going as far as predicting that 
there would be a new spirit of \"cooperative federalism\" in the 
country.  Given that it will take some time for the dust to 
settle around Ottawa, Williams appears to be taking a 
wait-and-see approach, a stance he called \"rational and 
logical\".  At the same time, he made it clear on the election 
campaign trail that he is prepared  \"to go to war with them\" if 
there is no political will in Ottawa to give his province a 
greater share of the offshore riches.  END COMMENT

deployment with the USS George Washington carrier strike group. 
In a gesture of support that seemed well-received by both the

Buck, senior Canadian military officers from the Halifax area, a 
local MP and Consul General made up the rest of the official

2.  Toronto sailed without her helicopter, and will at least in 
the early phases of the deployment rely on U.S. Navy helicopter 
support.  Flight restrictions were imposed on the aged Sea King 
chopper fleet following still-unexplained power losses, one of 
which caused a Sea King to crash on the deck of HMCS Iroquois. 
MARLANT chief of staff told CG that the hope is to have 
restrictions on Sea King use lifted and a helicopter either 
shipped or airlifted to Toronto by the end of March.  There was 
one good aspect to the chopper\'s unavailability:  MND Pratt and 
Vice-Admiral Buck were able to make their remarks to Toronto\'s 
crew in the frigate\'s unused helicopter hangar, which provided 
some shelter from the -35 Celsius wind-chill outside.  While 
neither Pratt nor Buck used the opportunity to mention the Sea

SUBJECT: CAMPOBELLO ISLAND RESIDENTS FEELING CUT OFF 
 
 
1.  Regional press and politicians have begun to focus attention 
on the plight of the 1450 residents of Campobello Island, New 
Brunswick.  This small a small Island in the Bay of Fundy is, 
from September to July, accessible from Canada only via a bridge 
to Lubec, Maine.  During the summer a private ferry connects 
Campobello Island to New Brunswick\'s Deer Island and mainland 
New Brunswick, but there is no ferry service the rest of the 
year.  Prior to September 11, Campobello Island residents say 
that they enjoyed virtually unhindered access through Maine to 
New Brunswick, but since then, they claim that increased U.S. 
security concerns have left them practically captives in their 
own homes. 
 
2.  The Islanders complain that new procedures, especially under 
heightened alert situations, have been slowing the movement of 
people and goods.  Last month the complaints reached a new level 
when new U.S. bioterrorism regulations were implemented and the 
residents complained that U.S. border officials had opened their 
Canadian mail as it passed through the U.S. en route to 
Campobello.  Canadian postal officials subsequently reported 
that they had worked out an arrangement with DHS whereby the 
U.S. authorities would not open Canadian mail unless there was a 
suspicious item. 
 
3.  The latest issue that is gaining both media and political 
attention is the future of the Island\'s only grocery store.  The 
store has escalating problems with availability of supplies and 
is headed for bankruptcy and closure if it cannot find a way to 
keep its shelves stocked.  Conservative MP Greg Thompson who 
represents the Island constituents in the Federal House of 
Commons has been the focus of several media reports, especially 
with his proposal that Canadian customs officials pre-check all 
deliveries to Campobello Island.  According to Thompson, that 
way, no matter what the level of the U.S. alert situation, 
Canadian supplies would still reach Canadian citizens without 
U.S. authorities delaying shipments.  New Brunswick Premier 
Bernard Lord and his senior bureaucrats are also putting the 
issue high on their agenda and have confirmed the seriousness of 
the situation with the grocery store and have asked us to 
intercede. 
 
4.  COMMENT:  This issue came up during CG\'s recent trip to New 
Brunswick.  We don\'t have all of the facts, but the outline 
seems pretty clear, and the islanders\' situation has only been 
exacerbated by the Canadian and U.S. BSE cases, which have 
closed U.S. and Canadian borders to each other\'s beef.  END 
COMMENT.

REF: 03 OTTAWA 3636 
 
 
1.  (U) This message is sensitive, but unclassified.  Not for 
distribution outside USG channels. 
 
2.  (U) SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION:  Reftel outlined Canadian 
reactions, which were mostly negative, to the proposed agreement 
on softwood lumber which was floated in early December.  At that 
time, it appeared that Canadian players would spend much or all 
of January weighing their options. 
 
3.  (U) In late January, Mission staff had discussions with key 
representatives of Atlantic provinces lumber producers.  Due to 
the substantially market-based timber supply in these provinces, 
their lumber producers have been exempted from past 
countervailing duties.  On trade policy questions, they speak 
unanimously through the Maritime Lumber Bureau (see website 
mlb.org).  This message outlines their viewpoint on the 
long-standing lumber dispute. 
 
4.  (SBU) Maritime industry representatives continue to favor a 
negotiated solution, provided they obtain adequate levels of 
quota.  They express frustration at the failure since 1986 of 
other provinces to reform their timber sale practices in ways 
which could begin to address U.S. concerns.  They hinted that 
the GOC trade minister must develop a comprehensive knowledge of 
the industry Canada-wide; he cannot be effective on this file by 
talking to an unrepresentative sub-set of producers.  They 
expect a return to the bargaining table sometime in late 
February or early March.  END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
 
5.  (SBU) THE MARITIME LUMBER BUREAU:  In Canadian geography, 
\"Maritime\" usually refers to three provinces (New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island) while \"Atlantic\" refers to 
these provinces plus Newfoundland -- a relative newcomer, having 
joined Canada in 1949.  While the MLB was formed in the 1920\'s 
and retains its original (less inclusive) name, it now 
represents lumber producers in all four Atlantic provinces. 
Mission staff spoke in late January with MLB President/CEO Diana 
Blenkhorn and also with Gaston Poitras, who heads the sawmills 
division of MLB\'s largest member, J.D. Irving Ltd. (JDI).  While 
Poitras was willing to discuss trade issues with us, both he and 
Blenkhorn stressed that the MLB speaks unanimously for Atlantic 
Canadian producers on softwood lumber trade.  Following are key 
points made by the MLB: 
 
6.  (U) LAND OWNERSHIP:  Of all softwood lumber production in 
the Maritimes, over 75 percent comes from trees grown on private 
land.  Moreover, timber sales from provincially-owned land (i.e. 
the remaining 25 percent) are market based, and these provinces\' 
stumpage rates have consistently increased since 1986. 
 
7.  (U) GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE:  The lumber industry in the 
Maritimes refuses government support, and specifically opposed 
the GOC\'s 2003 assistance package to lumber producing 
\"communities.\" 
 
8.   (U) ANTI-CIRCUMVENTION:  The MLB enforces one of North 
America\'s most rigid Certificate of Origin systems for lumber. 
This system is subject to ISO 9000 audits and requires lumber to 
be sawn from logs originating in Atlantic Canada or the State of 
Maine.  As long as this document is required for entry into the 
U.S. (as it has been since 8/2/2001), circumvention by other 
provinces/countries via the Maritimes is effectively prevented. 
 
9.   (SBU) AGREEMENT PROSPECTS:  Blenkhorn said that the 
December 6 proposal moved \"in the right direction\" and that an 
agreement \"might still be doable if the \'exits\' are revised.\" 
Both Blenkhorn and Poitras said they favor a negotiated solution 
to the current dispute, and that they expect a return to the 
table in late February or early March.  Blenkhorn said she made 
the MLB\'s case to U.S. industry representatives on December 4 
and that their main concern had been the risk of a surge of 
imports from the Maritimes, a concern which she said was not 
supported by historical experience.  She cited long-term 
economic data showing (in MLB\'s view) that Maritime lumber 
exports to the USA are driven by market demand, not by special 
treatment, and have shown growth similar to that of US lumber 
imports from third countries. 
 
10.  (SBU) COST OF DISPUTE:  Both Blenkhorn and Poitras lamented 
the fact that, while there have been \"no allegations\" of subsidy 
or dumping against Maritime producers, they are repeatedly 
\"dragged through\" this dispute and must pay the associated legal 
costs and anti-dumping duties.  They noted that US anti-dumping 
law applies to entire producing countries; in other words, it 
does not allow for exclusion of specific producers or geographic 
regions, whatever the merits of doing so.  Blenkhorn observed 
that had the dispute not involved an AD case this time round, it 
would be simpler to resolve, since British Columbia producers 
would not be so strongly motivated to drive down unit costs by 
increasing volumes (which she said they have been doing in order 
to set the stage for lower dumping margins in later periods). 
This, she said, is inflating the dispute\'s final cost. 
 
11.  (SBU) That being said, Blenkhorn emphasized that the MLB 
does not criticize U.S. trade legislation, but rather encourages 
industries on both sides of the border to respect it.  On this 
point, she remarked that the U.S. Coalition for Fair Lumber 
Imports (CFLI) has seemed more \"blinkered\" during the current 
round of the dispute. 
 
12.  (SBU) INTER-PROVINCIAL RELATIONS:  Blenkhorn emphasized the 
community of purpose between the MLB and U.S. lumber producers: 
both groups have difficulty competing with the real or effective 
subsidy programs which exist in other Canadian provinces, and 
they are frustrated by those provinces\' failure to reform over 
the past two decades.  To those who object to so-called \"special 
treatment\" for the MLB, Blenkhorn says such treatment is 
anything but \"special.\"  On the contrary, it is consistent with 
the intent of the U.S. industry\'s efforts, and other provinces 
should view the Maritime industry as a positive model. 
 
13.  (SBU) INDUSTRY CONSULTATION:  Blenkhorn remarked that in 
order to succeed on this file, new GOC International Trade 
Minister Jim Peterson needs to gain a detailed understanding of 
the lumber industry\'s circumstances in each region.  \"Just 
trying to get a prevailing view from eight or ten companies 
won\'t work.\"  The December 6 proposal \"was negotiated mainly by 
the B.C. industry, and they were betting they\'d get a 
disproportionate share of quota -- in return for driving the 
market into the tank while everyone else was reducing 
production.\"

SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
-------------------- 
 
1. Several energy infrastructure projects being contemplated in 
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia promise to bind Atlantic Canada 
further into the northeastern U.S. gas and electric grids, with 
likely benefits for New England energy consumers: 
 
- Refurbishment of NB Power\'s Point Lepreau nuclear generating 
station (awaiting GoNB political approval). 
 
- Construction of a major power line from Point Lepreau to 
Bangor (awaiting State of Maine approval). 
 
- Break-up of provincially-owned NB Power into five new entities 
(awaiting GoNB legislation).  A long run objective among New 
Brunswick energy leaders is to encourage an integrated electric 
power market covering New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward 
Island and much of northern Maine. 
 
- Proposals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in both 
provinces (one near Saint John, New Brunswick is expected to 
start construction by June). 
 
- Either LNG terminal, if completed, would require expansion of 
the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline (M&NE -- which runs from 
offshore Nova Scotia through New England) to approximately twice 
its current capacity. 
 
2. Mission ECON staff paid calls on several government and 
industry players in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia during late 
January.  This report, which is based on those conversations, is 
a joint effort of Amconsul Halifax and Amembassy Ottawa. 
 
END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
 
 
ELECTRIC POWER 
-------------- 
 
3.  Northern Maine\'s power grid is closely integrated with that 
of Atlantic Canada.  Bangor Hydro is controlled by Halifax-based 
Emera, the dominant power firm in Nova Scotia.  NB Power 
officials say that the grids in two Maine counties - Aroostook 
and Washington - are in effect \"part of the New Brunswick grid.\" 
 In 2003, NB Power exported roughly 2 terawatt-hours of electric 
power to Maine (net of imports).  Given recent declines in net 
power exports from the rest of Canada, NB Power now accounts for 
around 30 percent of Canada\'s net power exports to the United 
States.  NB Power has also historically supplied virtually all 
of the power needs of neighboring Prince Edward Island. 
 
4.  In New Brunswick, the electric power industry is dominated 
by provincial government-owned NB Power.  NB Power has a mix of 
hydroelectric and fossil-fuel generation plus a single-reactor 
nuclear plant at Point Lepreau, about 30 miles from Calais, 
Maine.  A decision is required soon on whether to replace, 
refurbish, or decommission the 22-year-old reactor. 
 
5.  New Brunswick\'s options for additional generation are 
limited.  Despite the presence of the M&NE pipeline (see below), 
natural gas is not currently available in New Brunswick at 
prices which would make it economic for power generation.  Few 
undeveloped hydroelectric sites are available.  The remaining 
options - burning imported coal or oil - are relatively 
polluting and carbon-emitting.  They are thus likely to conflict 
with the Government of Canada\'s commitment to implement the 
Kyoto Protocol.  Industry representatives await clarification of 
this policy, which will probably take several more months - 
meanwhile, they summarize this problem in the words \"regulatory 
risk\". 
 
6.  REACTOR RENEWAL:  Provincial government energy officials and 
NB Power executives are currently hanging on a GoNB decision on 
the future of the Point Lepreau nuclear plant.  Regulatory 
approvals are already in place for refurbishment, but the 
financial cost would be high to purchase large amounts of 
replacement power while 380 fuel channels in the reactor core 
are replaced and the turbines and generator are reconditioned. 
 
7.  In 2002, citing \"no significant economic advantage\" from 
refurbishing, provincial regulators recommended against it. 
However, Department of Energy officials believe the arguments in 
favor of refurbishment have strengthened since then, as the 
price outlook for natural gas (the main alternative) is now even 
higher.  Moreover, they say the regulators did not consider the 
value of refurbishment in avoiding future greenhouse gas 
emissions, particularly vis-`-vis coal, which is the lowest-cost 
option.  Finally, the nuclear option has the added attractions - 
particularly for a relatively low-income, high-unemployment 
province - of being both high-technology and relatively 
labor-intensive. 
 
8.  Whether or not the GoNB decides to refurbish Point Lepreau, 
building a second reactor at that site is also a possibility. 
Without outside financing, this would be even more costly than 
refurbishment.  The GoNB is exploring the potential for private 
sector participation in either option, and/or for Point Lepreau 
to be a \"demonstration site\" for the latest reactor design 
offered by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL).  The latter 
idea is based on hopes that AECL would foot most of the bill - 
but AECL in turn awaits a decision from the GOC, its sole 
shareholder, on options for AECL\'s future access to financing. 
 
9.  TRANSMISSION LINE TO BANGOR:  Whatever happens at Point 
Lepreau, NB Power also hopes to proceed with construction of a 
transmission line from the Lepreau area to the vicinity of 
Bangor, Maine (where the receiving utility, Bangor Hydro, is 
owned by Nova Scotia\'s Emera Inc).  This line could be completed 
by 2007 and would carry power in either direction depending on 
seasonal and other requirements.  NB Power officials say that 
all approvals still needed are on the U.S. side, and are 
environment-related:  some Maine stakeholders continue to demand 
that the line to follow an existing (but longer) corridor 
farther inland, which would be less economic. 
 
10. ELECTRICITY MARKET DEVELOPMENT:  Atlantic Canada and Maine 
are lightly populated and their electric demand is strongly 
winter-peaking.  New Brunswick energy officials expect this 
entire region to have a significant power scarcity problem by 
the winter of 2007-08 due to the shutdown of aging generating 
assets before new plants are built.  Gains in both cost and 
reliability can be expected from integrating the regional grid 
and facilitating power trade with the rest of the U.S. 
Northeast, and this makes up much of New Brunswick\'s current 
strategy for addressing the scarcity problem.  They add that it 
has the potential to greatly reduce the vulnerability of 
northern Maine to power outages.  (While neighboring Quebec is a 
major exporter of electricity from hydroelectric dams, it has 
few interconnections with New Brunswick and virtually none with 
Maine - and these small markets are a very long way from 
Quebec\'s reservoirs). 
 
11.  As of April 1, 2004, NB Power will be split into five new 
corporate entities (generating, transmission, distribution, 
nuclear, and a holding/services company) plus an Independent 
System Operator (ISO).  NB energy officials told us that, while 
they use U.S. FERC requirements to justify this publicly, they 
are really planning for the anticipated power scarcity in 
2007-2008 - when the new structure will allow them to invite 
proposals from independent power producers.  They also hope to 
share experience/models with counterparts in Nova Scotia, which 
plans to initiate a wholesale power market in 2005.  NB 
officials admit that a really integrated regional power market 
in Atlantic Canada will take \"another generation,\" and that for 
the current decade, they are working toward \"seamless\" clearing 
of power trades between the provinces\' still-separate power 
grids. 
 
NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION 
------------------------ 
 
12.  Nova Scotia\'s offshore Sable Island energy project began 
producing natural gas in early 2000.  Most of this gas is 
transmitted to New England via the Maritimes and Northeast 
Pipeline (MNE), which also has lateral lines serving industries 
near the Strait of Canso plus the urban areas of Halifax, 
Moncton and Saint John.  For more on the prospects for 
production of oil and gas from Atlantic Canada\'s continental 
shelf, see refs D and E and other reporting from Halifax. 
 
13.  The terms on which New Brunswick and Nova Scotia 
communities and industries can access this gas has been a 
sensitive political issue.  Energy exports into the United 
States are licensed by Canada\'s National Energy Board (NEB), 
which generally defers to market forces.  In order to buy gas 
from the MNE pipeline, Atlantic Canadians must pay prices which 
are tied to short-term markets in the Boston area (minus the 
additional cost of transportation to Boston).  New Brunswick 
interests have two complaints about this system.  First, they 
argue that the Boston-based prices are in some sense \"excessive\" 
(presumably, this means, higher than they would be if most or 
all of this gas were piped to markets in eastern Canada - which 
was one of the options before MNE was built).  Second, they 
complain that that it has become impossible to purchase MNE gas 
on secure, long-term contracts - which is a prerequisite for New 
Brunswick\'s industrial needs, and particularly for electric 
power generation. 
 
14.  In 2001-2002 the GoNB raised this issue formally with the 
NEB, which declined to take action, other than agreeing to 
\"monitor\" the gas transmission situation in New Brunswick.  GoNB 
officials remain unapologetic about having raised the issue, 
stressing that it is not a matter of \"Canada first\" (as their 
position was sometimes characterized in the media) but rather 
\"Canada too.\"  They say they are no longer pressing the issue 
because at current prices, natural gas is simply not a viable 
option for industrial uses or electric power generation in New 
Brunswick.  One event that might change this, they said, would 
be the construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal in 
Atlantic Canada. 
 
15.  LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS:  Like other parts of North America, 
Atlantic Canada is hearing proposals to construct terminals 
which would receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) from pressurized 
tanker ships and distribute it on the continental pipeline 
network.  Currently, there are two proposals: 
 
-- Access Northeast Energy Inc. (ane-inc.com), an infrastructure 
development firm, proposes to build an LNG terminal (\"Bear 
Head\") in an established heavy-industrial zone near Point Tupper 
on the Strait of Canso between mainland Nova Scotia and Cape 
Breton Island.  This site has very good natural features and the 
project enjoys local political support.  The proponent submitted 
environmental applications in 2003. 
 
-- Irving Oil Ltd. (irvingoilco.com), part of a family-owned 
industrial conglomerate which is currently a large buyer/shipper 
of gas on the MNE pipeline, proposes to build an LNG terminal on 
the Bay of Fundy about 5 miles east of Saint John, New 
Brunswick.  While this project is said to be less favored by 
geography (and local politics) than Bear Head, the proponent\'s 
industrial and financial autonomy may allow it to move ahead 
quickly, perhaps in an effort to pre-empt its competitor. 
Irving Oil says it plans to begin construction during 2004. 
 
16.  Either of these projects would require at least a doubling 
in size of the MNE pipeline, and either one would require the 
negotiation of gas supply contracts on a long-term basis in 
order to secure financing for both port and pipeline.  MNE 
representatives say that either project could fit well with 
their plans. 
 
17.  New Brunswick energy officials told us that they are open 
to either LNG project, provided New Brunswick buyers obtain 
adequate access to the gas.  They expect either project to 
revive natural gas as a fuel option for industrial development 
in New Brunswick. 
 
CONCLUSION/COMMENT 
------------------ 
 
18.  An array of interesting new energy infrastructure projects 
are on the horizon for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, all of 
which have the potential to significantly benefit neighboring 
U.S. states.  However, we also see the potential for great 
frustration, discord, and disappointment.  The key reason is 
that optimism has consistently run ahead of reality in Atlantic 
Canadian energy developments.  This is painfully evident in Nova 
Scotia\'s offshore industry, which, thirty years after the first 
resource discoveries, still struggles to deliver on popular 
expectations - particularly with respect to royalty flows.  Part 
of the problem is the multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional 
complexity of offshore regulation in Canada, which makes this 
one of the world\'s highest-cost areas of active exploration. 
 
19.  With respect to LNG ports and natural gas transmission, 
there is little doubt that further development of such 
infrastructure - if it occurs - would heat up a simmering debate 
about local industries\' access to natural gas.  In Nova Scotia, 
this issue is moderated by the provincial government\'s closeness 
to the needs of gas producers, and by the benefit of jobs 
created by gas exploration and production.  New Brunswickers, 
without such offsetting gains, are likely to be irritated by 
news that increasing volumes of gas would transit their province 
en route to New England markets. 
 
20.  In electric power, there could be difficult years ahead. 
If New Brunswick cannot or will not finance the refurbishment of 
the Point Lepreau reactor, the prospects for power generation in 
that province will be bleak.  The province could then be on a 
collision course with the GOC\'s climate change policy - and 
decisions on new fossil-fuelled generating plant will likely be 
slowed and clouded.  The results will affect residents of Maine 
for the rest of this decade.

SUBJECT: MAD COWS AND THE MARITIMES 
 
1.  Although the BSE crisis has had less of an impact in 
Maritime Canada than in the west, the fallout from mad cow 
disease has been significant in this region, too.  Prior to the 
BSE discovery Maritime provinces sold live cattle and beef 
across the border to the U.S., but more importantly raised 
cattle which were sold to fill out herds in Ontario and further 
west.  Since live cattle have stopped moving across the border, 
overall demand for Maritime beef and dairy cattle has dropped 
significantly. 
 
2.  In Nova Scotia, Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Chris 
D\'Entrement recently asked CG to relay to Washington the parlous 
state of cattle ranchers in the province and to urge a speedy 
resumption in cross-border trade.  He noted that while the 
industry was not huge by Canadian or U.S. standards, for a less 
well-to-do province like Nova Scotia it made a big contribution 
to the agriculture sector and to employment.  Premier John Hamm 
announced that the province was going to launch a marketing 
campaign (\"Brand Nova Scotia\") to encourage consumers to buy 
local beef.  He also said that the provincial government, which 
serves 23,000 meals a day in various institutions, would seek to 
buy home-grown beef to meet its needs. 
 
3.  In Prince Edward Island, where the economy is heavily 
dependent on agriculture, both Premier Pat Binns and deputy 
opposition leader Richard Brown made a point of telling CG that 
their beef industry was suffering as well, and urged a speedy 
resumption of cross-border trade.  Both drew parallels to U.S. 
restrictions several years ago on imports of PEI potatoes.  MP 
Wayne Easter has taken the issue a step further, calling 
restrictions on beef trade \"economic violence\" and saying that 
Canada ought to \"play hardball\" with the U.S. to get the border 
re-opened for beef and cattle. 
 
4.  COMMENT:  In responding to these and other questions about 
BSE-related restrictions on beef and cattle trade, we have made 
the point that it is in everyone\'s interest to have a 
science-based system that maintains public confidence in the 
integrity of the food supply.  Most of our interlocutors -- with 
the possible exception of Easter -- agree in principle that that 
is the right approach.  They just wish that things could move 
faster.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: ATLANTIC CANADA:  TOUGH BUDGETS PROVOKE LABOR UNREST 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1.  (SBU)   Two Atlantic provinces took very different 
approaches to the issue of public sector wages in their 
just-announced budgets.  The Premiers of Newfoundland and 
Labrador and New Brunswick both said they needed civil service 
wage freezes to help achieve fiscal soundness.  The results -- a 
looming general strike in one province and union acquiescence in 
the other -- say as much about the political experience of the 
two leaders as they do about the austere budgets. 
 
WILLIAMS:  CONFRONTATION 
 
2.  (SBU)  In Newfoundland and Labrador, Premier Danny Williams 
is facing a general strike of approximately 20,000 public sector 
employees in response to his plans to freeze public sector wages 
and eliminate approximately 4,000 government jobs.  Williams, 
who told the CG during a recent meeting that the tough measures 
are needed to bring the province\'s finances under control, 
announced publicly months before the budget that there could be 
no civil service pay raises.  News of the job cuts leaked a few 
days before the budget, enraging labor leaders who were already 
upset that the Premier had dismissed without discussion their 
call for a 21% salary increase over three years.  Most observers 
of the N-L labor scene, where unions can be quite militant, are 
predicting a bitter and protracted strike. 
 
LORD:  CONCILIATION 
 
3.  (SBU)  In New Brunswick, Premier Bernard Lord took a 
different approach to a wage freeze and seems to have gained at 
least near-term union acceptance of his plan.  Lord told CG that 
he took the unprecedented step of meeting privately with public 
sector  union leaders in advance of the budget to explain why 
there could be no wage increases this year and to seek their 
help in preserving jobs.  He also told them that future year 
raises were possible, depending on the state of the province\'s 
finances.  The meeting was clearly effective, as most major 
public sector unions in New Brunswick say they support the 
Premier\'s budget.  How much time the Premier bought will be seen 
this time next year when a new budget is due. 
 
COMMENT 
 
4.  (SBU)  Two austere budgets, two different approaches to 
public sector unions.  Premier Lord and others have suggested 
privately that Williams\' labor problems may stem as much from 
lack of political experience as from the tough measures needed 
to bring order to provincial finances.  Announcing publicly in 
advance of any negotiations that there would be no raises seemed 
almost designed to provoke a showdown with the unions. 
Interestingly, Lord has been criticized by some for not 
consulting about fiscal matters that have a direct impact on 
various aspects of the province, but he went the extra mile to 
consult in this case to try to avoid a confrontation.  For the 
short term at least Lord appears to be the more deft politician, 
but Williams is betting that he will emerge from his battle with 
the unions with the respect and public support necessary to 
craft a long-term agreement on civil service wages that will be 
vital to N-L\'s fiscal health.  END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, ECON, CA, Paul Martin, Elections 
SUBJECT: ATLANTIC CANADA:  PRE-ELECTION SOUNDINGS 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:   The consensus of opinion among political 
observers in Atlantic Canada is that Prime Minister Martin will 
call an early summer election.  While the region\'s 32 seats in 
Parliament are a relatively small bloc, they could make the 
difference in a close election between a minority and majority 
government.  Liberals think that Paul Martin will be much more 
popular tan Stephen Harper in the region, and that they will be 
able to steal some Conservative seats.  Both Conservatives and 
the NDP think voters are tired of the scandal-plagued Liberals 
and ready for a change.  However, our early guess is that there 
will not be any seismic shifts in party alignment as a result of 
the general election.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU)  The possibility of a federal election call in the 
near future has Atlantic Canadian parties and politicians 
nominating candidates, filling the campaign coffers and 
positioning themselves to be ready when the writ is dropped. 
The timing of the election is of course known only to the Prime 
Minister, but the expectation in this region seems to be 
generally for an early summer contest.  Federal Infrastructure 
Minister Andy Scott, for example, told CG that he does not 
expect Parliament to be recalled after the Easter recess, 
implying a late May/early June election.  A prominent Halifax 
Liberal who recently met with the PM said that Martin was upbeat 
about the party\'s prospects and recent polling data showing that 
Liberal support is recovering after a dip caused by the 
sponsorship scandal; our contact thinks the election will be 
held -- barring some unforeseen new scandalous revelation -- by 
the end of June at the latest.  Others expect the election to be 
called just after the Prime Minister meets with the President, 
although some cite the PM\'s desire to attend the 60th 
anniversary ceremonies for D-Day as a reason that the election 
call will not be made until early June. 
 
3.  (SBU)   Atlantic Canada has 32 MPs and over half of the 
region\'s seats are currently held by Liberals.   The top-of-mind 
issues for most Atlantic Canadians are health care, the economy 
and jobs, similar to the rest of the country.  Smaller but still 
significant groups watch developments in federal fisheries and 
environmental policies closely.  The region as a whole tends to 
be \"small c\" conservative on many social issues, particularly in 
rural areas (as an illustration, Nova Scotia does not have 
Sunday shopping and it is unclear if a promised referendum on 
the issue will change that), but topics like gay marriage and 
the gun registry do not excite the same level of passion that 
they seem to in other regions.  \"Small l\" liberalism is 
concentrated in the cities, which are growing in population 
relative to the countryside, something that has been reflected 
in re-drawn riding boundaries for the next election.  Atlantic 
Canadian voting patterns can be contrarian, as the recent 
Conservative Party leadership showed -- the region bucked the 
national trend toward Stephen Harper and generally supported 
Belinda Stronach. 
 
PAUL MARTIN: TARNISHED BUT STILL POPULAR? 
 
4.  (SBU)  Selection of candidates is important in many parts of 
the region, and voters are often more comfortable with a 
long-serving local politician or other community figure who is a 
known quantity.  Nevertheless, a popular national leader can 
have long coat tails as well and tip the balance in close races. 
 Liberals in Atlantic Canada will run a campaign emphasizing 
their leader, Prime Minister Paul Martin, whom they believe to 
be the major party leader most trusted by voters in the region. 
In addition they have a slate of experienced MPs, most of whom 
will be running again. 
 
5.  (SBU)  The Liberals are also making maximum use of 
incumbency by doing their part to spread government largesse in 
the area in advance of an election, with Liberal cabinet members 
prominently announcing in recent weeks new federal funding for 
university research and Halifax harbor cleanup, among other 
items.  The recent announcement of a 55% increase in the 
allowable snow crab catch also will not hurt their chances at 
the polls with people who make their living in the fishery. 
 
 
THE HARPER FACTOR 
 
6.  (SBU)  Although he has stressed his family\'s New Brunswick 
roots, and has appointed a Nova Scotian as his deputy leader, 
Conservative Stephen Harper is still viewed with some skepticism 
in Atlantic Canada, primarily for his comments about the 
region\'s \"culture of defeat.\"  He generally ran poorly in 
Atlantic Canada during the leadership contest, although he did 
well in ridings where he was either endorsed by a sitting MP 
(such as NB Southwest\'s Greg Thompson) or where he was able to 
campaign in person (such as Halifax).  Harper has made the 
effort to reach out to the region, making early trips to New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and has tried to clarify and soften 
his earlier call for the elimination of the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency. 
 
7.  (SBU)  How well Harper plays in Atlantic Canada will be a 
key to how well the Conservatives do here in the next election. 
Conservatives in all four provinces profess to be delighted with 
the party merger and with Harper\'s clear emergence as leader. 
They say the party can now stop splitting the conservative vote 
and unite to face entrenched Liberals.  Nevertheless, there are 
many \"red Tories\" in the region who are privately still somewhat 
ambivalent about Harper\'s Reform Party background.  Furthermore, 
since Reform/Canadian Alliance never polled significantly in 
Atlantic Canada, uniting the right as a practical matter will 
not help Conservative fortunes much since the vote here was not 
seriously split.  New Brunswick MP John Herron has gone public 
with his concerns about the merger, refusing to join the new 
party and sitting in the House as an \"Independent Conservative\" 
until the next election when he will run as a Liberal. 
 
A PROTEST VOTE FOR THE NDP? 
 
8.  (SBU)  Newfoundland and Labrador NDP leader Jack Harris told 
CG that \"optimists\" in his party are predicting 60 federal seats 
in the next election, many the result of a protest vote against 
the scandal-plagued Liberals.  Harris clearly thought that 
estimate was high (COMMENT:  So do we.  END COMMENT), but he was 
confident that the party would pick up seats nationwide in the 
next election.  Nova Scotia NDP leader Darrell Dexter, while 
uneasy predicting a specific seat total, says he thinks a 
minority government is a real possibility after the next 
election.  As one who is the leader of the opposition to a 
minority Tory government, he is not enthusiastic about the same 
thing at a national level. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Jack Layton, at least as of now, does not seem to be 
registering too strongly with voters in the region.  Only in 
Nova Scotia does the NDP have a noticeable presence at the 
provincial level; and one of the party\'s sitting federal MPs 
(Wendy Lill of Dartmouth) will not run again because of health 
concerns.  On balance the NDP\'s chances of significantly 
improving its seat total in Atlantic Canada do not seem all that 
great. 
 
PROVINCE-BY-PROVINCE 
 
10.  (SBU)   NOVA SCOTIA 
 
The region\'s most populous province has 11 federal MPs: five 
Liberals (including Fisheries Minister Geoff Regan, former 
minister Robert Thibault, U.S. relations czar Scott Brison and 
Parliamentary Secretary Mark Eyking), three Conservatives 
(including Deputy leader Peter MacKay) and three NDP (including 
former leader Alexa McDonough).  Conservatives will target their 
former member Scott Brison who crossed the floor to sit as a 
Liberal; Stephen Harper has already appeared at the riding 
meeting to select Brison\'s Conservative opponent and has said 
that he would \"pop in\" more than once during the general 
election to campaign for Brison\'s Conservative challenger and 
return the riding to it\'s \"traditional\" blue.  The NDP, usually 
strongest in the cities, will go after Geoff Regan\'s Halifax 
West seat and the Conservative-held South Shore riding where 
they perceive a weak candidate. 
 
11.  (SBU)  Liberals are confident they can gain one or more of 
the Conservative-held seats in the province; the NDP thinks it 
can pick off at least one Liberal and one Conservative; 
Conservatives think Brison is vulnerable.  Progressive 
Conservative Premier John Hamm, who leads a minority government, 
and was careful to stay away from endorsing anyone in the 
leadership race, will throw his weight behind the Conservative 
candidates, which could help in close races. 
 
12.  (SBU)  NEW BRUNSWICK 
 
Six of New Brunswick\'s 10 seats are Liberal, and John Herron 
will run as a Liberal in the next election.  The Conservatives 
have two seats: one seems relatively safe while the other, 
vacated by the retiring Elsie Wayne, is up for grabs.  One 
notable non-candidate in the next election, former Premier Frank 
McKenna, told CG that he had been encouraged by the Prime 
Minister to re-enter politics, but that the PM was not able to 
deliver a promised Moncton-area riding from which to run. 
McKenna refused to contest a nomination against a sitting 
Liberal MP, citing the negative publicity of the Sheila 
Copps-Tony Valeri food fight, and also said he was not inclined 
to parachute into a riding where he had no local connections, 
like Elsie Wayne\'s in St. John.  McKenna was very upbeat about 
Liberal prospects in New Brunswick, saying that despite 
divisions and hard feelings among the Chretien and Martin camps, 
\"the party always closes ranks and rallies\" at election time. 
 
13.  (SBU)  NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR 
 
N-L\'s seven seats are split four Liberal and three Conservative. 
 Although the provincial government is handily controlled by the 
Tories, Premier Danny Williams has seen his popularity fall 
significantly since last November\'s election victory.  He is 
currently locked in a tough battle with public sector unions 
over wages and job security, something that might have an impact 
on Conservative fortunes in a federal election.  One of his key 
issues is a new revenue sharing deal with Ottawa for offshore 
energy revenues, something that would sharply boost his 
popularity.  (FYI:  Opposition leader Roger Grimes told CG that 
if Williams pulls off a new deal with Ottawa: \"I would vote for 
him myself and urge others to do so.\"  END FYI.)  A senior 
Liberal strategist told CG that Ottawa is ready to agree to a 
new revenue-sharing formula for offshore energy royalties, but 
won\'t do so until after the election to avoid giving any kind of 
a boost to Williams (and Tory Premier John Hamm in NS). 
 
14.  (SBU)  Former opposition house leader and current fisheries 
critic Loyola Hearn told CG before the Conservative leadership 
selection that he expected the party to keep its three seats and 
possibly add one in a general election.  But he also said that 
N-L politics are volatile enough that depending on what was 
happening at the time of the election he and his Conservative 
colleagues could potentially all lose their seats.  A Liberal 
told CG that he expects exactly that to happen in N-L -- a 
Liberal sweep. 
 
15.  (SBU)  PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND 
 
With only four seats, tiny PEI is too easily overlooked in 
federal political calculations.  Currently all four seats are 
held by Liberals, although at the provincial level the Tories in 
late 2003 comfortably formed a government after taking 23 of the 
27 seats in the legislature.  Conservatives hope to pick one or 
more seats at the federal level, and Premier Binns\'s deputy 
minister recently stepped down from his government position to 
seek a Conservative nomination to run in the general election. 
 
COMMENT 
 
16.  (SBU)  A week is a long time in politics, so handicapping a 
yet-to-be-called election is largely a notional exercise (except 
for the Prime Minister as he tries to determine an optimal time 
to wrong-foot his opponents).  But using the \"snapshot\" we\'ve 
taken in recent weeks of some of the key ridings, personalities 
and issues it does not appear at this point that there will be a 
major re-alignment of party fortunes in Atlantic Canada.  Each 
party is confident that it can make some gains, but only the 
Liberals are talking -- privately, to be sure -- of a 
significant  increase in seats, mainly because of perceived 
regional antipathy toward Stephen Harper.  On election day it 
may turn out that they were whistling past the graveyard, but 
they do have the advantage of incumbency and a fairly popular 
leader on their side.  END COMMENT

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  ALSO CONTAINS PROPRIETARY 
INFORMATION.  PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Nova Scotia and Newfoundland have been 
working to streamline their regulatory regimes for offshore 
energy exploration, but industry calls for combining the two 
federal-provincial offshore boards will not be acted upon any 
time soon.  The Premiers of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and 
Labrador are both pushing hard for a better deal on energy 
royalties from offshore production:  Paul Martin says he\'s 
considering the plan while Stephen Harper has already said he 
agrees with it.  The relatively slow pace of exploration 
offshore Nova Scotia is dramatically illustrated by the presence 
of two jack-up drilling rigs in Halifax harbor.  Irving Oil 
Company is moving ahead with plans for a liquefied natural gas 
terminal near St. John on the Bay of Fundy, action that may 
preclude development of an LNG facility in Nova Scotia. 
Newfoundland and Labrador\'s Premier is keen to press ahead with 
the Lower Churchill Falls hydroelectric development, but he 
would like to minimize Quebec\'s participation in the project. 
New Brunswick Power and the provincial energy ministry have come 
under stinging criticism for mishandling the conversion of a 
power plant to allow it to burn bitumen-based \"orimulsion\" fuel 
from Venezuela.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PUSH TO STREAMLINE OFFSHORE REGULATIONS ... 
 
2.  (SBU)  Both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador 
government officials have said that they are looking for ways to 
streamline and make more transparent regulations regarding 
offshore energy exploration.  Nova Scotia, in particular, is 
concerned that the pace of offshore exploration has fallen (see 
para 5 below), with a resulting slowdown in support industry 
work and revenues.  NS Energy Minister Cecil Clarke and his 
Deputy Minister Dan McFadyen have come to the conclusion that 
they need to do a better job of selling the province\'s offshore 
potential to the energy industry, particularly to U.S. firms. 
Clarke plans trips to major offshore energy shows and Washington 
to meet with the industry and U.S. regulators to draw attention 
to what Clarke call\'s the province\'s \"steady, go-forward plan\" 
for offshore development. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Streamlining, however, will probably not extend to 
combining the two federal-provincial offshore energy boards, as 
many in the industry have called for.  Premier Danny Williams in 
St. John\'s was categorical that his government saw no advantage 
to a combined board, something Fred Way, vice-chairman of the 
Canada-N-L board, confirmed with CG recently.  In practice, 
differing rules in the two jurisdictions add inefficiencies to 
the hunt for energy in Atlantic Canada\'s offshore areas, but 
neither province wants to suffer the potential job losses in 
support industries that combining the boards and rationalizing 
their rules would entail.  N-L\'s level of offshore activity is 
much higher right now than Nova Scotia\'s, so St. John\'s 
perceives that it has the most to lose by creating a single 
joint offshore board. 
 
... AND KEEP MORE OF THE REVENUES 
 
4.  (U)  Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams and 
his Nova Scotia counterpart John Hamm are leading the charge for 
a new deal with Ottawa that would give the provinces a larger 
share of the royalties.  A key issue will be whether the federal 
government \"claws back\" equalization payments if offshore 
royalties rise -- as things currently stand the provinces lose 
70 cents of equalization for every additional dollar of offshore 
revenue they collect.  Williams, in particular, has made 
re-negotiation of the Atlantic Accord a top priority and told CG 
that he has tried hard to cultivate a relationship with PM Paul 
Martin to advance this and other provincial goals.  Martin said 
recently during a visit to Nova Scotia that he was considering 
changing the formula; Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper 
beat him to the punch by announcing that he supports increased 
royalties with no clawback. 
 
RIGS IN THE HARBOR 
 
5.  (U/PROPIN)  One indication of the relatively slow pace of 
exploration in Nova Scotia\'s offshore in recent months is that 
there are now two jack-up drilling rigs parked in Halifax harbor 
between jobs.  GlobalSantaFe\'s \"Galaxy II,\" designed and built 
specifically to work in this region, has been in port since 
November 2003 after about five years of drilling in the 
relatively shallow waters around Sable Island.  Rowan\'s \"Gorilla 
V\" joined its competitor in the harbor in March.  There is 
currently only one rig working in Nova Scotia\'s offshore, but 
both GSF and Rowan tell us they expect to be back out by June. 
Keeping a rig in port for prolonged periods is a costly 
proposition:  GSF told us that they spend US$60-70,000 per day 
keeping the \"Galaxy II\" at the dock; when the rig is working it 
can be billed at 10 to 15 times that amount. 
LNG:  NEW BRUNSWICK STEALING A MARCH ON NOVA SCOTIA? 
 
6.  (SBU)  As reported in reftel, Irving Oil Ltd. is moving 
forward with plans for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant near 
St. John, New Brunswick, on the Bay of Fundy.  Senior NB energy 
official recently told CG that Irving delivered its 
environmental impact statement for the plant to the NB 
government in mid-March, and that the area proposed for the 
plant had been set aside for industrial development.  Irving, 
they said, was \"very serious\" about LNG.  This is probably bad 
news for the firm ANE, which is proposing to build an LNG 
facility near Port Hawksbury, NS.  A Nova Scotia cabinet member 
who represents the area told CG in fall 2003 that a cabinet 
decision and announcement about the project would be made before 
Christmas, but it does not seem to have materialized yet. 
COMMENT:  There is a good case to be made for one LNG plant in 
the area in the medium term, but it is hard to see how two could 
make economic and financial sense.  Whichever group gets going 
first will probably win.  END COMMENT. 
 
LOWER CHURCHILL HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT 
 
7.  (SBU)  Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams told 
CG during a recent trip to St. John\'s that his government was 
committed to development of the Lower Churchill Falls 
hydroelectric power project.  Williams clearly would love to 
find a way to push the project forward without involving Quebec, 
perhaps by cutting a deal directly with U.S. electricity 
consumers that would permit financing for the project. 
Unfortunately, geography seems to make a deal with N-L\'s 
neighboring province inevitable, since there seems to be no 
realistic way to send electricity to the U.S. without using 
Quebec\'s lines or building new ones that pass through the 
province. 
 
8.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  The existing deal with Quebec for Upper 
Churchill Falls electricity is widely seen in N-L as a textbook 
example of poor negotiation, so it is not all that surprising 
that Williams would love to gain the near-universal acclaim in 
the province that would follow a Lower Churchill deal which 
somehow managed to exclude Quebec.  Interestingly, one of the 
justifications offered for the multi-billion dollar proposed 
rail tunnel under the Strait of Belle Isle that would link 
Newfoundland to the Labrador mainland is that the tunnel could 
be used to house electric transmission lines.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? 
 
9.   (SBU)  And finally, in New Brunswick, a committee of the 
legislature is pondering what to do about the orimulsion scandal 
after hearing hours of testimony from provincial officials.  The 
short version of this story is that NB Power, which has worked 
with a Venezuelan firm for more than 15 years on ways to use the 
bitumen-based fuel and has had one power plant burning 
orimulsion for a decade, went ahead with C$600-700 million worth 
of renovations on another plant to allow it to burn orimulsion. 
Unfortunately, there was apparently nothing but a handshake deal 
to provide fuel to the second plant, and the supplier has 
recently decided that there are more profitable things to do 
with orimulsion than ship it to New Brunswick.  Provincial 
energy officials told CG that about half of the modifications to 
the plant were emissions control and other upgrades that were 
needed regardless of the type of fuel, but that about C$350 
million would be wasted if indeed the plant had to be converted 
to burn something other than orimulsion.  News of mismanagement 
on such a scale comes at a bad time for the province: the budget 
is tight, civil service salaries are frozen and services are 
being cut back.

SUBJECT: NEFOUNDLAND-LABRADOR GOVERNMENT SUFFERS THROUGH BITTER 
UNREST 
 
REF: HALIFAX 97 
 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY: Having broken a 4-week-old public sector union 
strike April 27 with the introduction of back-to-work 
legislation, Newfoundland-Labrador Tory Premier Danny Williams 
is making a last-ditch offer to negotiate a collective labor 
agreement.  On April 29, the Premier said he would suspend 
passage of back-to-work legislation until May 3, in response to 
union officials\' agreement to a new round of negotiations. 
While he has thoroughly angered the unions, to what degree he 
has damaged his political future is unknown, pending general 
public reaction.  Looming on the horizon is a potential stike by 
the teachers and nurses unions.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) The cash-strapped Williams government and the 20,000 
members of the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public 
and Private Employees and the Canadian Union of Public Employees 
have been locked in a bitter dispute over new labor agreements, 
culminating in a 4-week strike that only ended on April 27, when 
the government introduced back-to-work legislation.  The 
province\'s unionized workforce called the bill the toughest back 
to work legislation in Canada.  Consisting of tough penalties 
for not returning to work and a mandated four-year agreement, 
the government\'s terms fell well short of what the unions were 
seeking on issues such as wage increases and sick leave 
benefits. 
 
3. (U) Despite an ugly backlash from labor groups and the fact 
that the workers have returned to their jobs, the Premier has 
remained undeterred in moving the legislation through the House 
of Assembly.  Claiming that the strike has drastically affected 
hospitals, nursing homes, schools, provincially-operated ferries 
and other public services, the Premier said he had a 
responsibility to protect public health and safety from the 
possibility of any more labor unrest.  Nonetheless, the Premier 
pledged to continue negotiations with the union officials up 
until the last minute. That offer met with some success on April 
29, when the Premier said he would suspend passage of the bill 
until May 3 in response to a new round of negotiations with the 
union officials. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT:  This bitter and uncertain labor scene 
undoubtedly has brought a swift end to Danny Williams\' honeymoon 
with the electorate just six months after he and his Tory party 
won a decisive victory in the October 2003 provincial election. 
Our contacts on \"The Rock\" tell us that Williams undoubtedly has 
made a lot of enemies with his hard-nosed approach with the 
unions, to the point that no one is willing to guess just how 
damaging this situation will be to his political career.  A 
major unknown is just how the general public will judge the 
Premier\'s actions, which will not be known until the next poll 
results are released.  Residents, especially those with cardiac 
problems and needing cancer treatments, have been waiting weeks 
for services, and hospital administrators are acknowledging that 
it could months to get caught up from the strike.  Obviously 
with their health in jeopardy, these patients have had little 
support for the strikers. 
 
4. (SBU) Comment (Continued):  There are also countless other 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who support Williams and his 
firm stance that this is not the time in the province\'s fiscal 
history to be looking at wage increases.  It is not clear just 
how prevalent is this sentiment.  One point that our contacts do 
agree on is that the Premier and his government are definitely 
going through a tough time with no real end in sight.  However 
the situation with the two public sector unions is eventually 
resolved, contracts with the province\'s teachers and nurses are 
also about to expire.  The Premier could then find himself 
knee-deep in the exact same situation a few months down the road 
- only this time it will be teachers and nurses on the picket 
line.  END COMMENT

REF: HALIFAX 127 AND PREVIOUS 
 
 
1.  Organized labor groups in Newfoundland-Labrador are 
threatening to get even with Conservative Premier Danny Williams 
for his government\'s passage of controversial labor legislation. 
 The Williams government used its overwhelming majority in the 
House of Assembly on May 4 to pass Bill 18 which imposes a new 
contract on 20,000 public sector workers who were on strike for 
four weeks in April (reftel).  The legislation imposes a 
four-year contract that cuts sick leave benefits for new public 
sector employees and freezes wages for the next two years. 
Workers will get a five percent raise in the final two years of 
the deal. 
 
2.  Officials of the two unions which represent the workers and 
other provincial labor officials condemned the legislation, 
accusing the Premier of setting labor relations back 20 years. 
Some have even gone as far as ordering specialized car license 
plates with the inscription \"One Term Danny\" to reflect their 
vow to defeat the Williams government come the next provincial 
election.  Since Williams just won election last October, his 
detractors could be waiting a long time to show their 
disapproval at the ballot box.  In the meantime, it appears 
certain that Williams has lost any chance of a cooperative 
relationship with the province\'s labor groups if he was looking 
to them for help in stabilizing the province\'s fiscal situation.

REF: 03 HALIFAX  0349 
 
1.  In a May 7 press conference at Pier 21 in Halifax, Canada 
attended by Consul, Canadian Transport Minister Tony Valeri 
announced a three-year, $115 million federal program to assist 
Canadian ports and ports facilities upgrade their security. 
This program will enable Canada to not only comply with new 
International Maritime Organization security requirements which 
take effect July 1, but will also bring Canada into compliance 
with stricter North American requirements.   According to 
Valeri, the security funding - using the general 10:1 yardstick 
- favorably compares with that which the USG is devoting to the 
same purposes and matches the U.S. program to assist ports and 
port facilities.   The funding will be distributed under a 75 
percent government/25 percent recipient cost-share formula, for 
a total of $150 million in enhancements on such things as 
surveillance, fencing and other perimeter controls, command, 
control and communications structures, and infrastructure 
protection by guards or police. 
 
2.  While this Marine Facility Security Contribution Program 
funding is in addition to the $308 million already announced as 
earmarked for marine security, both are part of the five-year 
$690 million new national security policy announced April 27. 
Fisheries and Ocean Minister Geoff Regan and Defense Minister 
David Pratt then provided further details on how the marine 
security funds will be spent on the Coast Guard and Navy.  Major 
projects are creation of joint marine security operations 
centers in Halifax (Trinity) and Esquimalt, B.C. (Athena), 
secure communications capability for Coast Guard vessels, 
increased on-water days for both the Navy and Coast Guard, and 
increased aerial surveillance time.

SUBJECT: FEDERAL ELECTION:  LIBERALS LIKELY TO RETAIN HOLD ON 
ATLANTIC CANADA 
 
REF: HALIFAX 101 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  Despite several close races, overall there appears to be 
little excitement surrounding the federal election campaign in 
Atlantic Canada:  voters appear to be headed toward re-electing 
a majority of Liberals in the region\'s 32 ridings.  Key factors 
are a general mistrust of the newly configured Conservative 
party and a relatively weak and ineffective New Democratic 
Party.  Regional political observers and pollsters say there 
will likely be few surprises or major changes in seat 
distribution in the Atlantic provinces.  END SUMMARY 
 
PREDICTIONS OF A LIBERAL WIN IN THE REGION 
------------------------------------------ 
2.  With less than two weeks to go in the federal election 
campaign, it appears that Atlantic Canadians will re-elect a 
majority of Liberal MPs in the region\'s 32 ridings.  This 
finding of a major regional polling company which conducted a 
survey in the first part of the campaign seems to have been 
borne out in subsequent weeks.  In releasing their results on 
June 8, the pollsters said that among Atlantic Canadian voters 
who are decided or leaning towards a particular party, the 
Liberals had 45 percent support, the Conservatives 27 percent 
and the New Democrats 19 percent.  Should this sentiment prevail 
on June 28, it will mean little change in the pre-election 
distribution of seats.  Before dissolution of Parliament the 
Liberals held 19 of the 32 seats, the Conservatives 8 and the 
NDP 4.  The remaining seat was held by an independent, a former 
Tory now running as a Liberal. 
 
THE LIBERALS VS. CONSERVATIVES: THE FEAR FACTOR 
------------------------------------------ 
3.  Election watchers are quick to point out that the Atlantic 
Liberals\' wide lead over their rivals is not due to a ringing 
endorsement for \"L\'Equipe Martin/The Martin Team.\"  In fact, 
there is much the same anti-Liberal sentiment resonating here as 
elsewhere in the country.  Issues such as the sponsorship 
scandal, cuts to health care spending and the cost of the 
federal gun registry are all featuring prominently on the 
campaign trail here.  The difference is that Liberal candidates 
are being saved by the region\'s apparent reluctance to embrace 
leader Steven Harper and his new Conservative Party.  Atlantic 
Canadians are quick to point out that they are having a hard 
time believing that the new Conservative agenda is drastically 
different from Harper\'s old Alliance party platform, 
particularly after comments that Harper and his election team 
have made on economic development policy, health care and other 
social programs.  In New Brunswick, Canada\'s only officially 
bilingual province where francophones make up one-third of the 
population, Liberal candidates are also cashing in on the 
perception that the election of a Conservative government could 
spell the erosion if not the demise of federal bilingualism 
policy. 
 
4.  One of our Liberal contacts, who in March had seemed 
reasonably confident that a late-June election would bring Paul 
Martin back to power at the head of a majority government, told 
CG recently: \"All I am sure of is that there will be a minority 
government; but I don\'t know who will be heading it.\" 
 
THE NDP - STILL SEARCHING FOR A BREAKTHROUGH 
------------------------------------------ 
5.  Another interesting aspect of the campaign is the fate of 
the New Democratic Party in Atlantic Canada.  With the polls 
confirming the third place finish for the NDP, it seems certain 
that the party will not be breaking any new ground in this 
campaign.  Despite the party\'s success on the provincial side in 
Nova Scotia, NDP strategists admit that they are still not well 
organized elsewhere in the region.  Also, commentators remark 
that new national leader Jack Layton still sees the four 
Atlantic provinces as unfamiliar territory, and has been largely 
unsuccessful in moving support over to the NDP.  One party MLA 
told CG that this election should have been spectacularly 
successful for the NDP: the Liberals were tainted by scandal and 
the Conservatives were \"scary\" -- ideal conditions for a protest 
vote for the NDP.  He bemoaned the party\'s inability to gain any 
traction in the region, and said he thought they would hold 
their existing seats but probably not gain any despite what 
should have been optimal conditions. 
 
ISSUES - TRADITIONAL THEMES, BUT A FEW SURPRISES 
------------------------------------------ 
6. Issues playing out in the campaign are still the perennial 
favorites such as such problems relating to the region\'s 
relatively weak economy, federal funding for health care, and 
money for roads and municipal infrastructure.  However, there 
have been two significant regional issues which have emerged 
onto the national stage: calls for an extension of Canada\'s 
200-mile limit as a means to curb illegal foreign fishing off 
Newfoundland-Labrador and new deals for Newfoundland-Labrador 
and Nova Scotia on revenue sharing from offshore oil and gas 
resources.  Unfortunately for the Liberals neither issue has 
played out particularly well for them.  On the fishing issue, 
Nova Scotia cabinet minister Geoff Regan and his Newfoundland 
counterpart John Efford have been vague in their explanations of 
just how a re-elected Martin government would handle fishery 
protection, leading to the perception that perhaps it will fall 
by the wayside after June 28.  On offshore revenues, Prime 
Minster Martin came under heavy criticism from Conservative 
candidates by being the last of the three national party leaders 
to propose ending the current fiscal regime which sees the 
federal government \"claw back\" the majority of the offshore 
revenue by reducing federal equalization payments.  Conservative 
leader Harper and NDP chief Layton both promised to revamp the 
revenue structure weeks before Mr. Martin finally announced his 
intention to do the same. 
 
NO SHORTAGE OF INTERESTING RACES 
------------------------------------------ 
7.  Interesting races continue to be the Kings-Hants riding in 
Nova Scotia where former Progressive Conservative MP Scott 
Brison made his much publicized jump to the Liberal camp.  In 
New Brunswick, Minister of State for Infrastructure Andy Scott 
is garnering much attention in his Fredericton riding as he is 
fighting to hold onto his seat in the face of tough Conservative 
opponent.  On Prince Edward Island, the main attraction there is 
the race in the Cardigan riding where Liberal incumbent Laurence 
MacAulay is starting to look like he might lose to his 
Conservative challenger, the former chief of staff to 
Conservative Premier Pat Binns. 
 
COMMENT:  A STATUS QUO RESULT? 
------------------------------------------ 
8.  But outside of these ridings and a handful of others where 
there is some tough trench warfare going on, there appears to be 
little excitement generated here as the campaign moves into the 
homestretch.  Several politicians with whom we have spoken note 
that voter apathy seems much higher this year than in the past; 
they fret that turnout will be low.  In any case, Atlantic 
Canadians appear to have made up their minds in favor of the 
status quo.  As one more cynical commentator remarked: if that\'s 
the case, then that also means that \"the Liberals will still be 
sleazy, the Reform (Conservatives) will still sound like the 
lunatic fringe and the NDP will still be clueless.\"  If the 
region does vote for little or no change, it will be interesting 
to see if Atlantic Canadians might be voting against an 
anti-Liberal tide that could be flowing across other parts of 
the country.  END COMMENT

ATLANTIC CANADA 
 
REF: HALIFAX 0159 AND PREVIOUS 
 
 
1.  In our meetings this past week with election-watchers, 
pollsters, party officials and candidates themselves, the 
consensus still appears to be that the Liberals will maintain 
the majority of the 32 seats in Atlantic Canada in the June 28 
federal election (reftel).  With just a few days left in the 
campaign our contacts are standing by their original predictions 
that the Liberals will continue to take advantage of the general 
trepidation towards Conservative leader Stephen Harper and the 
reluctance of the electorate to move towards the third-place New 
Democratic Party.  Although Conservative candidates have had 
some success in assuaging the fears that Atlantic Canadians have 
over how Mr. Harper views economic development issues in the 
Atlantic region, voters are not ready to abandon the Liberals 
entirely.  Consequently, and in spite of what our contacts 
believe has been a poor campaign by the Liberals, the Liberals 
will still prevail on election day.  One of our contacts summed 
up the campaign by saying that Atlantic Canadians will simply be 
asking themselves, \"Who can I trust, or who can I least 
distrust?\" 
 
2.  Comment:  With their apparent agreement on who is going to 
capture the 32 seats here, the focus has now drifted to the 
national stage.  Like their counterparts across the country, 
each is coming up with a variety of scenarios for what will 
happen in the event of a widely anticipated minority government 
situation.  While they have somewhat different views on what 
party can form alliances with whom, the one point they do have 
in common is that the country could very well be headed to the 
polls in the next year, year-and-half time frame.  End Comment

1.  This past weekend, at Whitney Pier, Sydney, Nova Scotia, 
Canada, during a routine search of the Canadian Steamship Lines 
vessel the \"Shelia Ann\", Canadian Border Services Agency 
officials and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seized 83 kilos 
of cocaine.  The drugs were hidden in two duffle bags and are 
said to be worth C$10 million.  The ship was reported as coming 
to Canada from Maracaibo, Venezuela, with a load of coal for a 
Nova Scotia power plant. The drugs were reportedly hidden in an 
underwater grate at the bottom of the ship in Venezuela.  Police 
believe divers were used to put the cocaine in the grate. 
 
2.  After a thorough investigation of the ship and interviews 
with the captain and crew, the \"Sheila Ann\" was released on July 
2, 2004 for it\'s onward destination in Florida.  Consulate staff 
observed it leaving Halifax harbor the same day. 
 
3.  This seizure has gained national interest as the ship 
belongs to a Montreal-based company, CSL, formerly owned by 
Prime Minister Paul Martin and his wife Sheila and since August 
2003 controlled by their three sons.

SUBJECT: MAJOR DRUG BUST OFF COAST OF NOVA SCOTIA 
 
REF: Halifax 172 
 
 
1.  (U)  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Halifax, 
Nova Scotia, working with officials from Montreal seized 500 
kilograms of cocaine aboard the Antiguan 15-meter sailing vessel 
the \"Friend Ship\" on Monday, July 5, 2004.  The seizure was 
worth an estimated value of more than C$18 million. 
 
2. (U) The year-long international operation dubbed \"Project 
Columbie\" by the Montreal police force was the second major 
cocaine seizure in the Nova Scotia in less than a week.  When 
police in Montreal learned a group of Quebec residents were 
conspiring with South American cocaine suppliers to smuggle tons 
of drugs from the Caribbean and South American into Canada and 
England, they worked together with other Federal Canadian 
government agencies and officials from Antigua and French 
officials from the Caribbean Island of St. Martin.  According to 
local broadcast news and newspaper reports, the \"Friend Ship\" 
left Antigua on June 23, 2004.  The sailing vessel\'s first stop 
was to be Nova Scotia where the drugs were destined for markets 
in Canada.  The drugs were to be off-loaded in the Village of 
Moser River, about 90 kilometers east of Halifax.  The drugs 
were then to be hidden in a private residence in Moser River 
before being distributed to other provinces within Canada. The 
bust resulted in nine people being arrested from Quebec, Nova 
Scotia and Antigua.  The \"Friend Ship\" has been seized and is 
currently being held under close guard at the Department of 
National Defence property in Halifax Harbor. 
 
3. (SBU)  According to a senior RCMP official, the shipment was 
from Venezuela, as was the case with reftel.  The official 
lamented that beyond the arrests, there would be little impact 
on drug flows to Canada.  \"To get a feeling for the size of the 
traffic, you only have to know that the price for cocaine 
remains unchanged following each bust.\" Arguing that the 
traffickers target Canada because of the lower risk (the U.S. 
imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years, whereas Canada 
only imposes 8 years),  the official offered their opinion that 
Canada must stiffens its drug laws if it wishes to significantly 
impact the trade over the long-term.

SUBJECT: U.S./CANADA SOVEREIGNTY DISPUTE:  UPDATE ON MACHIAS SEAL 
ISLAND LOBSTER FISHERY 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  Despite an ongoing sovereignty dispute, Maine and 
New Brunswick fishermen are managing to fish side by side in 
waters off Machias Seal Island without any major incidents to 
date.  However, Canadian authorities remain frustrated by the 
inability of local groups to conclude a complementary management 
regime for the area.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  A spokesperson for the Canadian Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans (DFO) has told us that there have been no major incidents 
to date between U.S. and Canadian fishermen who are fishing in 
the waters off Machias Seal Island in the Gulf of Maine.  In 
recent years, there have been tensions between lobster fishermen 
from New Brunswick and their Maine counterparts over fishing 
seasons and conflicts over gear placement.  The United States 
and Canada have an ongoing sovereignty dispute involving the 
Island and the surrounding waters, but nonetheless fishermen 
from both countries had shared the area for decades in an 
informal and amicable arrangement.  Maine fishermen historically 
fished the area during the summer months and the New Brunswick 
fishermen from mid-November to the spring.  However, in recent 
years, the New Brunswick fishermen claimed that their Maine 
counterparts were fishing throughout the whole year and were 
posing a serious threat to the lobster stocks. 
 
3.  In response to these assertions, DFO began pressuring the 
New Brunswick fishermen to work out complementary management 
measures with their Maine counterparts as a way to curtail 
growing tensions between both groups and to ensure long term 
conservation of the stocks.  However, by 2002 there had been 
little success at the discussion table.  That prompted federal 
officials to announce the establishment of a special summer 
fishery for the New Brunswick fishermen as a way of highlighting 
the Canadian government\'s sovereignty case and to bring pressure 
on both sides to start discussions.  With no progress in 2003 
either, Ottawa again opened a special season for that summer and 
repeated the move again this year.  This year\'s special season 
runs from July 1 to October 29 with 29 license holders 
participating in the fishery. 
 
4.  Comment:  Our DFO contact is clearly frustrated by the two 
groups\' inability to reach a complementary agreement on issues 
such as access, management and enforcement which our contact 
believes could be devised regardless of the sovereignty case. 
However, with neither side apparently willing to discuss these 
issues, it appears that this summer\'s season will end the same 
as the last two -- with no agreement.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NO END IN SIGHT TO LENGTHY ATLANTIC CANADA TELECOMS STRIKE 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  How Bell Canada fares in its talks with its 
unionized workforce could have an impact on a 13-week strike by 
communication workers in Atlantic Canada, employed by Aliant 
Communications.  Industry watchers believe Bell, the major 
shareholder in Aliant, is pressuring the Aliant negotiators not 
to make any concessions to its workforce\'s demands for fear of a 
ripple effect in its own labor negotiations in Ontario.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  Representatives of Aliant, the largest communication service 
company in Atlantic Canada, and its striking unions broke off 
talks on July 16 with no progress on ending a prolonged labor 
dispute.  The 4,000 unionized workers have been on strike since 
April 23 when both sides could not reach an agreement on a new 
contract.  Issues include health and pension benefits, higher 
wages and limits on contracting out services.  The union members 
account for two-thirds of the company\'s workforce and are 
presented by the Council of Atlantic Telecommunications Unions. 
There are no other meetings planned and union members are vowing 
to stay on the picket line indefinitely. 
 
3.  Industry watchers believe that Aliant\'s failure to reach an 
agreement with its union is linked to Bell Canada\'s negotiations 
with its own unions in Central Canada.  Bell is the majority 
shareholder in Aliant and analysts believe that Bell does not 
want the Aliant negotiators to make any concessions to its 
workforce until after Bell has concluded its own deal.  In the 
meantime Aliant has retrained and reassigned its 1800 management 
employees, but the company conceded recently that it was 
suffering as well as the union members from the effects of the 
strike.  Since the company is the major provider for telephone, 
wireless, Internet, e-commerce and network services in Atlantic 
Canada, there are worries over the long term effect on the 
communications industry in the region.  Under the circumstances 
Aliant officials, union leaders, industry analysts and consumers 
alike will be highly interested bystanders as the Bell labor 
situation unfolds.

TORONTO HOMECOMING 
 
REF: HALIFAX 0010 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  The new Defense Minister hit the ground running by 
announcing a decision in favor of Sikorsky on the long-delayed 
maritime helicopter replacement program.  He also welcomed home 
HMCS Toronto, which returned to a tumultuous welcome in Halifax 
after a six-month deployment with a U.S. strike force in the 
Persian Gulf.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   Newly-appointed Minister of National Defense Bill Graham 
ended years of waiting by announcing that Canada had decided to 
select the Sikorsky H-92 to replace the Air Force\'s 40-year old 
Sea King helicopters.  Graham, flanked by Nova Scotia Cabinet 
members Geoff Regan and Scott Brison, made the announcement at 
Halifax\'s CFB Shearwater, where many of the new choppers will be 
based.  COMMENT:  Graham, who told CG he appreciated the 
Secretary\'s thoughtfulness in calling him to congratulate him on 
 
SIPDIS 
his new job, seemed happy to be in his new portfolio, and the 
military brass seemed comfortable with him and happy that he was 
not a newcomer to security policy.  One noted that Graham had 
been a naval reservist, had visited Canadian troops in 
Afghanistan and other places and understood how stretched the 
military really was.  END COMMENT. 
 
3.  Shortly after the announcement, Graham and CDS Ray Henault 
joined military families and senior military officers and 
civilians, including CG, in a rousing ceremony to welcome home 
HMCS Toronto, returning after a six-month deployment in the Gulf 
with the USS George Washington Strike Group.  In remarks to the 
crew broadcast as the ship was steaming into Halifax harbor, 
Chief of Maritime Staff Ron Buck praised Toronto\'s contribution 
to the war on terrorism and to \"defending our way of life.\" 
Asked later about when the next Canadian frigate would deploy to 
the Gulf, VADM Buck said he thought it would be around October, 
but that a final decision had not been made. 
 
4.  Waiting for Toronto to pull up to the dock, VADM Buck told 
CG that he expected EH Industries to challenge the award of the 
contract to Sikorsky, possibly through litigation, but he said 
the decision was clearly \"the right helicopter for the right 
price\" and would withstand any appeals or lawsuits.  He also 
suggested that DND was much more comfortable with Sikorsky\'s 
approach to customer service, and that EHI had not helped itself 
in the competition with its attitude in this area.  Other senior 
military officers with whom CG spoke expressed relief that a 
decision had finally been made and said they were pleased that 
Cabinet had acted early in the new government\'s mandate to 
address a long-overdue requirement.  Buck and others said they 
were hopeful that the Martin government would address a number 
of other crying resource needs for the Canadian Forces. 
Fisheries Minister Regan echoed that point, saying that it was a 
good sign that the new Cabinet had decided to buy a U.S.-built 
helicopter as one of its first items of business.  He said it 
showed that the Prime Minister was serious about re-building 
defense capabilities, and working with the  U.S. 
 
5.  In addition to providing desperately-needed capabilities for 
the Canadian Forces, the helicopter program will breathe some 
new life into CFB Shearwater, which has been dying the death of 
a thousand cuts for years.  The most visible evidence of decline 
was the transfer this year of the annual fall air show to the 
Halifax International Airport since Shearwater\'s runway has 
become unsafe and the military could no longer afford to support 
the event.  Outgoing 12 Wing Commander told CG several months 
ago that once the announcement of the new helicopter was made 
the base would begin a construction program to build new 
training and maintenance facilities for the H-92.  He 
anticipated that the Sea King would be in service in parallel 
with the H-92 for up to five years, until all of the new 
aircraft were operational.  This will put a serious strain on 
Canadian Air Force staffing, since during the transition period 
the CAAF will have to have two sets of pilots, crews and 
maintenance staff. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  A good news day all around, with the successful 
completion of a lengthy deployment with U.S. forces and -- one 
hopes -- the successful conclusion of a procurement that has 
dragged on an embarrassingly long time.  It would be nice if 
this announcement presaged a period where government devoted the 
attention and resources to the Canadian Forces that they so 
badly need, but the Martin Team faces a lot of hard choices in 
coming months and unfortunately it is all too easy in Canada to 
kick military spending needs down the fiscal road rather than 
act on them.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: ATLANTIC CANADA: TWO LNG PROJECTS EYE NEW ENGLAND MARKET 
 
REF: HALIFAX 040 
 
 
1. SUMMARY:  The conditional approval of two LNG projects in 
Atlantic Canada, could substantially increase gas supplies in 
the U.S. northeast.  Irving Oil and Access Northeast both say 
when their respective projects become operational in 2007, they 
will produce as much as two billion cubic feet per day of 
natural gas, the bulk of which will be destined for the United 
States. 
END SUMMARY 
 
2. New England could see substantially increased supplies of 
natural gas from Atlantic Canada now that federal and provincial 
regulatory bodies have approved two liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
projects.  On August 6, Irving Oil of Saint John New Brunswick, 
part of the Irving family business empire, announced it had 
received regulatory approval for its proposed LNG terminal.  The 
Irving project, the first of several LNG projects currently 
proposed for Northeastern North America to get the green light, 
will be situated at the company\'s existing Canaport deepwater 
marine terminal near Saint John, and 65 miles from the Maine-New 
Brunswick border. 
 
3.  Under the proposed plan, Irving will import natural gas by 
tanker in a liquid state, then warm it back into a gas.  The gas 
would then be transmitted through the existing Maritimes and 
Northeast Pipeline (M&NEP) which currently transports gas from 
offshore Nova Scotia to New England and the relatively small 
regional market in Atlantic Canada.  The expected capacity of 
the Irving terminal would be as much as one billion cubic feet 
of natural gas per day once it becomes operational in 2007. 
Although there could be some increased local demand for the gas, 
the bulk of the output would be destined for the Northeastern 
U.S. market. 
 
4.  The second approved LNG proposal is that planned by Access 
Northeast Energy Incorporated (ANEI) which wants to develop a 
terminal in the Strait of Canso at Bear Head, Nova Scotia, 
approximately 140 miles north of Halifax.  ANEI, a 
privately-owned Canadian company, received its approval on 
August 9 for a project similar to Irving\'s in that it would 
involve shipping gas to a marine terminal,  converting it and 
sending it over the M&NE pipeline.  Like the Irving proposal, 
the output from the Bear Head project could be as much as one 
billion cubic feet per day, with the project also coming on 
stream by 2007. 
 
5.  Both projects will still have some hurdles to cross.  For 
Irving, its approval from the government of New Brunswick comes 
with 24 conditions, primarily environmental and safety-based, 
but Irving officials believe they will have no difficulty in 
meeting these requirements.  ANEI will also have to satisfy 
similar environmental conditions dictated by the government of 
Nova Scotia.  On the economic side, M&NEP would have to expand 
its pipeline capacity to handle what could be as much as two 
billion cubic feet a day that the two plants would produce. 
Pipeline officials have already said that they would be eager to 
look at expansion proposals.  Also, both Irving and ANEI will 
have to get signed contracts for supplies of LNG and also firm 
up marketing contracts. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  The approval of these two Atlantic LNG projects 
may be the first of several.  While some analysts believe that 
the North American market can definitely sustain more than two 
LNG plants in the region, others doubt that more LNG terminal 
projects in Nova Scotia would be economically viable.  For now, 
all eyes are on Irving and ANEI to see just how difficult it 
will be for these first two projects to arrange financing and 
get up and running.  Irving has tried to steal a march on rivals 
and gain the advantage of being first into the market.  Given a 
relatively cooperative relationship with regulators in New 
Brunswick, its project may be able to come on stream faster than 
ANEI.  END COMMENT

SUBJECT: ATLANTIC CANADA:  THE FUTURE OF 5 WING GOOSE BAY 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:   The Ambassador recently met with civic 
leaders and military officers at 5 Wing Goose Bay and the 
adjoining community of Happy Valley during a trip to Labrador. 
Community leaders and the Premier of the province are concerned 
that declining use of the military base at Goose Bay by NATO 
allies will ultimately result in its closure, depriving the 
community of its major source of jobs.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE BASE 
 
2.  (U)  5 Wing Goose Bay was built and staffed primarily by 
U.S. forces during the Second World War and through much of the 
Cold War.  It has been used by NATO allies as a flight training 
area for decades, although in recent years allies have begun 
cutting back the amount of training they do there, and some have 
announced plans to leave altogether.  The base boasts two major 
runways -- 11,000 and 9,000 feet -- and has a training area of 
about 130,000 square kilometers (more than 50,000 square miles) 
where flying is allowed as low as 100 feet.  In an arrangement 
unique to Canada, virtually all operations of the base have been 
privatized, with a contractor responsible for all operations and 
maintenance except search and rescue and the Canadian Forces 
contingent reduced to a skeleton 70 personnel, except when 
CF-18s are temporarily deployed to the base on a NORAD mission. 
 
3.  (U)  As changing technology and declining budgets have 
altered allied training needs, the GOC seems to have realized 
belatedly that it had priced Goose Bay out of the market. 
Better facilities, better training opportunities and a more 
reasonable cost sharing arrangement have caused foreign 
governments to shift Canadian training operations to 4 Wing Cold 
Lake, Alberta, leaving Goose Bay with fewer and fewer clients. 
The GOC initial response to this was ambivalent, leaving many 
with the impression that it intended to close or mothball the 
base.  Recently, however, the GOC has begun to try to market 
Goose Bay\'s strategic location and advantages not only for 
fighter-bomber flight training but for special operations 
exercises, tactical air transport training, and cold weather 
trials of new equipment, among other things.  The GOC has also 
revised its approach to fees, adopting a \"hotel\" approach with 
fixed costs rather than amortizing all of the base\'s annual 
costs over the number of sorties flown by allies during the 
training season.  U.S. National Guard and Reserve units are 
among the allies being targeted for a modest marketing campaign. 
 
 
THE PROBLEM 
 
4.  (SBU)  Goose Bay clearly has some advantages as a training 
location.  The GOC\'s efforts to market the base, however, are 
not helped by its failure to use it itself, something akin to a 
chef not eating in his own restaurant.  A senior Canadian Air 
Force officer at 5 Wing, after nodding throughout a briefing on 
the base\'s advantages, spent much of a private conversation 
describing how Cold Lake was superior in many respects because 
the GOC has made the investment to create more modern training 
facilities there.  Goose Bay is the main gateway to Labrador for 
civilian aircraft, and would still be needed for commercial use 
regardless of any military use of the base; the military 
presence, however, has created far more jobs than the civilian 
use of the airport. 
 
5.  (U)  Newfoundland-Labrador Premier Danny Williams, in Happy 
Valley-Goose Bay (HVGB) for much of the Ambassador\'s visit, made 
it clear that the province is working closely with the community 
to keep the base open.  Among other things, Williams has taken a 
delegation to Europe to meet with NATO allies about their 
training needs and to see what the province could do to improve 
their chances of continuing to train in Labrador.  He said that 
he had been encouraged by a visit to HVGB in March 2004 by 
then-Defense Minister David Pratt and Prime Minister Paul 
Martin.  Martin, according to Williams and other community 
leaders, spoke of the need to provide more GOC support to the 
base.  Subsequently, they said, the Air Force became much more 
upbeat in presentations about the base.  However, that has so 
far not stopped allies from announcing plans to pull out, and 
the GOC has yet to deliver on any tangible assistance for the 
base or the community. 
 
WHERE TO NEXT? 
 
6.  (U)  During his discussions with civic leaders the 
Ambassador noted that in his own experience with base 
realignment in the U.S. it was vital to get the private sector 
involved and to have all members of the community speaking with 
one voice.  This the community of HVGB had clearly done. 
Premier Williams pointed out, in the context of the Ambassador\'s 
remarks about the need to all pull together as one team, that 
the federal government now had to step up to the plate as well 
and do more to show that it was committed to Goose Bay\'s 
continued viability as a military training facility. 
 
7.  (U)  Although there is talk of increasing tourism and the 
economic benefits that will flow from development of  the 
Voisey\'s Bay nickel deposits and the Lower Churchill Falls 
hydroelectric potential, these are long-term projects.  In the 
short to medium term the community sees little option but to 
pursue continued military training at 5 Wing as the foundation 
on which to build a more diversified economy. 
 
COMMENT 
 
8.  (SBU)  In some ways the situation of Happy Valley-Goose Bay 
is a variant of a common story in the remoter parts of Canada: 
the closing of a mine or industry which was a town\'s main 
employer.  While the HVGB community seems to be doing an 
excellent job of pulling together and thinking creatively about 
how the base can be revived, a tangible commitment by the GOC to 
the survival of 5 Wing seems to be an essential element in 
keeping it operational.  In the longer term the development of 
Labrador\'s considerable energy and mineral resources will 
provide new economic stimulus, although at a cost to the 
wilderness that surrounds the few human settlements in the 
region.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE:  BADLY NEEDED NEW ENGLAND-ATLANTIC 
CANADA BRIDGE MOVING FORWARD 
 
1.  As debates about new border infrastructure continue, a 
coalition of local, state, provincial and federal officials in 
the U.S. and Canada have been quietly pushing for a new crossing 
to replace the inadequate two-lane bridge between Calais, ME and 
St. Stephen, NB.  The eighth-busiest border crossing is the 
gateway for the vast majority of trade between the U.S. and 
Atlantic Canada.  Much of it is live (shellfish) or very fresh 
(seafood, Christmas trees) and border delays can severely reduce 
a cargo\'s value. 
 
2.  Plans are moving forward to build a new bridge and 
inspection area to supplement the existing outdated and 
inadequate infrastructure.  Maine Transportation Commissioner 
David Cole and his staff told Ambassador and CG about the 
27-year history of the project, noting that consensus has 
emerged in recent years on both the U.S. and Canadian sides that 
a new bridge is vital if trade is to continue to grow.  The 
government of Maine sees a new bridge as a key component of the 
state\'s economic development, as does the province of New 
Brunswick.  At the local level there is agreement on the need 
for the new crossing as well as its site, with few if any 
objections raised to the project.  Most local residents, in 
fact, would welcome the diversion of much of the traffic that 
now winds through and snarls downtown streets on both sides of 
the border. 
 
3.   DHS Assistant Port Director Tim Dannell stressed to us the 
importance to U.S. security of replacing the existing inadequate 
inspection facilities.   The existing Canadian inspection area 
is marginally better than on the U.S. side, where DHS officers 
work out of a 70-year old building.  A new crossing will have 
much more space for inspections and will allow deployment of 
state of the art technologies to detect suspicious shipments. 
Additional bridge lanes will allow for the possibility of 
introducing FAST/NEXUS to further speed legitimate travel and 
commerce. 
 
4.  Funding remains the final major hurdle for the project.  On 
the Canadian side both the provincial and federal governments 
indicate that money will be available when the project has all 
necessary approvals.  Maine officials tell us that they are 
pleased with the progress being made toward the Presidential 
Permit required for the new border crossing and are cautiously 
optimistic that the Congress will approve the money necessary to 
get the much needed new bridge underway soon.

SUBJECT: HALIFAX PRECLEARANCE:  BANGOR WITHDRAWS OBJECTIONS 
 
1.  The City Council of Bangor, Maine, unanimously approved late 
October 25 a resolution to withdraw opposition to Halifax 
International Airport\'s (HIA) application for preclearance.  The 
Council also authorized the City Manager and Airport Director to 
sign an agreement with HIA on joint marketing.  These efforts 
will focus mainly on expanding regional air service and traffic, 
but will also include broader economic development and tourism 
marketing. In the end Bangor reportedly indicated that it had no 
concerns about originating preclearance, but insisted on an 
undertaking in writing from HIA that it would never seek 
in-transit preclearance.  Betting that Bangor would ultimately 
withdraw its objections, Halifax recently committed itself to 
beginning an expansion project that will -- if preclearance is 
approved -- create a new dedicated area for U.S. DHS personnel. 
HIA anticipates that the earliest this C$70 million facility 
facility could be ready would be late 2006; a spring 2007 
opening date is more likely. 
 
2.  The Council\'s consensus decision came despite what we were 
told was a major last-ditch effort to derail it or delay it 
until after the November 2 election.  Bangor\'s next step will be 
to communicate its action to Maine\'s Senators and Member of 
Congress.  HIA anticipates hosting soon a meeting to get a joint 
marketing council up and running.  Airport CEO Reg Milley plans 
to travel to Ottawa October 26 to brief Foreign Affairs and 
press for the inclusion of Halifax preclearance on the next 
Ridge-MacLellan meeting agenda. 
 
3.  COMMENT:  Bangor\'s action comes after a major effort for 
close to two years on the part of HIA to address concerns over 
lost business if preclearance comes to pass.  HIA had been 
prepared to offer to indemnify Bangor for lost revenue, but in 
the end the Council reportedly did not insist on it.  The 
airport terminal expansion project, which will only be completed 
if preclearance is approved, could generate significant business 
opportunities for U.S. firms.  A Trade Lead on the project has 
already been filed by FCS Halifax.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: PROVINCIAL POLITICS IN ATLANTIC CANADA:  WHO\'S IN AND WHO\'S 
OUT 
 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY:  This fall has proven to be a busy 
season for provincial politicians in Atlantic Canada.  Minority 
governments, shortened legislative sessions, by-elections, and 
party leadership changes have combined to create more attention 
than usual on what\'s going on both inside and outside the four 
legislatures.  Accordingly, we have taken a snapshot look at 
each of the provinces showing the situation in each with a few 
predictions on what\'s in store for the region. 
 
2.  Both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are facing minority 
governments suggesting a decline in the Conservative Party\'s 
sway in these provinces.  In N.B. the Liberals are the strongest 
potential challenger, while in N.S. it is the NDP.  In the short 
term neither of these provincial governments seem likely to be 
overturned, but in the longer term observers should not be 
surprised to see electoral change.  In Newfoundland and Labrador 
and Prince Edward Island the Conservative leadership is 
experiencing more popularity.  Only in Newfoundland could the 
popularity be fleeting, pending the Premier\'s success in 
negotiations with Ottawa. Thus it will be interesting to watch 
whether the potential fall of the Conservatives in N.B. or N.S. 
will shake the popularity of the Conservatives in PEI and 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  END INTRODUCTION/SUMMARY 
 
New Brunswick 
------------- 
 
3.  Lt. Governor Herminigilde Chiasson (Appointed for a five 
year term on August 26, 2003) 
 
Premier: Bernard Lord (Party: Progressive Conservatives) 
Most recent election:  June 9, 2003 
Current Party Standings in the House (55 seats in total) 
        Progressive Conservatives 28 
                (Leader: Bernard Lord since October 18, 1997 
        Liberals 26 
                (Leader: Shawn Graham since May 11, 2002 
        New Democrats 1 
                (Leader:  Elizabeth Weir since 1988) 
 
Election history:  Bernard Lord and his Conservative party have 
ruled New Brunswick since they overturned the incumbent Liberals 
in the June 1999 election. 
 
Current political scene:  While portrayed as a rising star on 
the national political stage, Conservative Premier Bernard Lord 
is suffering from popularity problems with the folks at home. 
Lord\'s tough policy decisions on health care reform have created 
widespread unrest throughout the province and have stirred up 
serious dissention in the party ranks over how the Premier 
handled contentious issues such as hospital bed closures and 
downgrading hospitals. Helping to fan the flames of discontent 
is Liberal Opposition leader Shawn Graham, now openly talking of 
bringing down the government in the next legislative session of 
the house. 
 
The possibility of an eventual non-confidence motion has led 
Graham to institute a series of personnel changes in his caucus 
office including the addition of a new chief of staff whose 
principal job will be to prepare the party for battle with the 
Conservatives.  However, the Liberals are still struggling with 
a credibility problem among the electorate.  Hesitancy is thus 
the play of the day, with some Liberal rank and file calling for 
restraint in order to allow the party to build up more momentum 
before forcing a new election. The NDP is similarly reluctant to 
bring down the current government. The current NDP leader 
Elizabeth Weir, who holds the party\'s only seat in the house, 
recently announced her resignation as leader, although there is 
no date yet for a convention to pick a replacement.  All things 
considered, this will make the next New Brunswick legislative 
session the one to watch in the region. 
 
Nova Scotia 
----------- 
 
4.  Lt. Governor: Myra A. Freeman (Appointed for a five year 
term on April 28, 2000) 
Premier: John F. Hamm (Party: Progressive Conservatives-PC) 
Most Recent Election: August 5, 2003 
Party Standings in the House (52 seats in total) 
        Progressive Conservatives 25 
                (Leader:  John F. Hamm since October 28, 1995) 
        Liberals 12 
(Leader:  Francis Mackenzie since October 23, 2004) 
        New Democrats 15 
                (Leader:  Darrell Dexter since June 4, 2001) 
 
Election History:  John Hamm and his Conservatives have been 
governing Nova Scotia since July 1999 when they defeated the 
incumbent Liberal government by a wide majority. 
 
Current political scene:  Like his counterpart in New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia premier John Hamm is in a precarious minority 
situation, although the opposition is split with the NDP forming 
the official opposition and the Liberals in third place.  The 
NDP has done very well in the province, offering a cooperative 
attitude in working with the incumbent Tories to keep the 
government afloat. 
 
With the NDP viewed as a credible alternative to the ruling 
Tories, the Liberals appear destined to remain in third place. 
The Liberals have been plagued with weak leadership and this 
does not seem to have changed with the recent newly elected 
leader, Francis MacKenzie. MacKenzie does not have a seat in the 
legislature and will likely have to wait until another general 
election before he has a chance to enter the house.  Thus it 
seems that John Hamm\'s popularity may be slipping and this will 
likely work in favor of the NDP leaving the Liberals to cool 
their heels for the time being. 
 
Newfoundland-Labrador 
--------------------- 
 
5.  Lt. Governor Edward M. Roberts (Appointed for a five year 
term on November 1, 2002) 
Premier: Danny Williams (Party: Progressive Conservatives-PC) 
Most recent election: October 21, 2003 
Party Standings in the House (48 seats in total) 
        Conservatives 34 
                (Leader:  Danny Williams since April 7, 2001) 
        Liberals 12 
                (Leader:  Roger Grimes since February 3, 2001) 
        New Democrats 2 
                (Leader:  Jack Harris since November, 1992) 
 
Election History: With their win in the October 2003 provincial 
election, Premier Williams and his Tories upset a 12-year long 
Liberal administration. 
 
Current political scene: Premier Danny Williams recently 
celebrated his first-year anniversary, but he admits that it has 
been a tough year.  After reviewing the province\'s fiscal 
situation last year, Williams said he had no choice but to 
institute tough measures to bring the province\'s fiscal 
situation under control and enduring a contentious public sector 
strike.  While fiscal watchers applauded the government\'s tough 
stance, the measures left the government shaken.  However, 
Williams has seen a surge in popularity with his firm stance 
with the federal government on a revenue sharing agreement on 
offshore energy projects. Should Williams get his way in this 
current dispute with Ottawa, it would be the crowning 
achievement for Williams and one that even opposition leader 
Roger Grimes admits he would applaud. Due to the popularity of 
Williams\' position on revenue sharing, Grimes and the two NDP 
members have been forced to instead zero in on Williams\' 
personal style of one-man showmanship, hence their new name for 
the Premier, the \"Daniator.\" 
 
Prince Edward Island 
--------------------- 
6.  Lt. Governor J. Lionce Bernard (Appointed for a five year 
term on May 28, 2001) 
Premier: Patrick George Binns (Party: Progressive Conservatives) 
Most Recent Election: September 29, 2003 
Party Standings in the House (27 seats in total) 
        Conservatives 
                (Leader: Patrick George Binns since May 4, 1996 
        Liberals 
                (Leader:  Robert Ghiz since April 5, 2003) 
 
Election History:  Pat Binns and the Conservatives have been 
governing Prince Edward Island since 1996 when they overturned a 
10-year incumbent Liberal government 
 
Current political scene: Premier Pat Binns is enjoying continued 
support from Islanders, making it difficult for Liberal 
Opposition Leader Robert Ghiz to make many inroads.  In fact, 
pundits believe that it would take the eventual retirement of 
the popular Binns to open up any opportunities for Ghiz. As for 
the NDP, the party has never elected a member either federally 
or provincially, and still appears unprepared to make any 
headway. 
 
7.  COMMENT:  In the last decade the Atlantic Provinces have 
borne witness to the almost universal defeat in provincial 
legislatures of the previously dominant Liberal Party in favor 
of the Progressive Conservatives.  At the federal level, 
however, the story has been different: in the June 2004 election 
the Liberals took a significant majority of the region\'s seats 
in the Parliament in Ottawa.   The question to ask while 
watching the Atlantic Provinces in future will be whether this 
\"spell\" of Conservatism was simply an attempt on the part of 
Atlantic Canadians to express their dissatisfaction with the 
perceived financial irresponsibility of provincial Liberal 
governments or whether this is indicative of a general shift in 
ideology. 
 
8.  The decline in the popularity of the Conservatives in Nova 
Scotia and New Brunswick indicates that the former may be the 
more accurate analysis, however the situation is less clear in 
the other two Atlantic Provinces.  If the past few years were 
just a warning, then watchers will likely see a return to the 
center following a restructuring and redefinition of the 
alternative parties.  As mentioned, the province to watch will 
be New Brunswick, both because the politics are interesting in 
themselves, but also because N.B. could be the bellwether for a 
more general trend away from the Tories in provincial 
legislatures.

1.  (U)  While Ottawa has yet to follow through on its May 7 
pledge of federal funding for Canadian Marine Facility Security, 
the Port of Halifax has ambitiously pressed forward with a 
series of new security measures using its own funding.  These 
measures place the Port in the forefront of Canadian maritime 
security and on a par with its stateside counterparts.  The Port 
of Halifax receives roughly 200,000 cruise ship passengers a 
year - 95 percent U.S. citizens - and transships over 4 million 
tons of containerized cargo a year - a significant percentage 
destined for U.S. markets. 
2. (SBU)  In a recent conversation, Port of Halifax Vice 
President for Operations and Security George Malec and 
newly-hired manager of Marine Security Gord Helm, discussed 
current and ongoing efforts to enhance security at the Port of 
Halifax.  All efforts are being funded out of the Port\'s own 
operating budget.  The Port has met IMO ISPS Code requirements 
and is currently undergoing certification by Transport Canada 
for the more stringent Canadian Marine Transportation Security 
Act - on a par with U.S. standards under the Marine 
Transportation Security Act. 
3. (SBU) Passenger:  The passenger (cruise ship) facilities of 
the Port are fenced off with camera surveillance.  To enter or 
exit the secure area alongside cruise ships, passengers must 
present both id cards and boarding passes.  Trucks with 
provisions are now prohibited from pulling up alongside ships. 
There is also a 24-hour police presence of at least two 
officers.  Malec described this situation as unique for a 
Canadian port.  Other ports, he stated, rely on PILT (policing 
in lieu of taxation), which provides no-charge police protection 
on an-on-call, as-available basis.  Halifax, on the other hand, 
pays for a constant police presence and, as they are police, 
allows for armed officers who can respond with deadly force if 
needed. 
4.  (SBU) Container:  Halifax Port also pays for a constant 
police presence at its two cargo terminals.  No containers are 
allowed to leave the facilities without the papers being checked 
by an officer.  (This procedure was implemented following the 
disappearance of a targeted cargo container this past summer.) 
In addition, the Port is in discussions with Transport Canada - 
its supervisory body - over its plan to acquire radiation ion 
detection units for each of the cargo terminal piers.  The goal 
is that, once implemented. no container will leave the port 
without being scanned. 
5. (SBU) General: The Port has purchased an all-weather patrol 
boat, which has been turned over to the police for use.  The 
boat is identical to boats used by DND, to provide for 
interoperability.  The police are already manning the boat and 
undergoing final marine certifications.  Both Malec and Marine 
Security Director Helm described cooperation between the port, 
coast guard, and navy as excellent.  Helm, a former naval 
officer, is in the process of drafting an operations and safety 
plan for the harbor, to further enhance the cooperation. 
Looking forward, they discussed the soon-to-begin process of 
security clearances for all port employees.  Background checks 
will be conducted by CSIS and the information forwarded by 
Transport Canada to Port authorities for clearance decisions. 
6. (SBU) Malec, in particular, stressed the level of cooperation 
between the Port and stateside authorities.  Malec himself spent 
a large part of the past summer in visits with officials from 
the U.S. Coast Guard and the ports in New York, Boston, and 
Baltimore.  Malec spoke with approval of the recently-formed 
Nova Scotia association of small ports, (Sydney, Pictou, 
Parrsboro, Sheet Harbor, Shelburne, and Yarmouth) saying Halifax 
would be happy to consult and provide advice, but could offer no 
funding. Port security in Nova Scotia, he said, is only as 
strong as the weakest of the various ports\' security.

SUBJECT: ATLANTIC CANADA ECONOMIC OUTLOOK:  MODERATE GROWTH FOR 2005 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  Atlantic Provinces Economic Council\'s annual 
business outlook briefing predicts moderating growth for 
Canada\'s four eastern provinces.  Softening global demand and 
prices for commodities and forest products, low or no growth in 
tourism, a cooling housing market and declines in consumer 
spending all add up to regional growth in 2005 that will be 
about one percentage point below the forecast for Canada as a 
whole.  Major project spending -- non-residential construction 
and offshore energy investment -- remains a positive factor in 
the near term, but a \"project gap\" is looming in 2006-2007 that 
could undermine growth unless offset by other stimulus. 
Competition from Asia is growing for traditional regional 
exports such as seafood.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  David Chaundy, Senior Economist for the private think tank 
Atlantic Provinces Economic Council (APEC) briefed CG and other 
attendees of the Council\'s annual economic outlook conference 
for the region November 15.  Chaundy\'s estimate for overall 
Canadian economic growth in 2004 is 2.9%, and his estimate for 
2005 is 3.1%.  For Atlantic Canada the picture is not quite as 
good.  The APEC forecast notes a number of key negative factors 
that are likely to have an impact on regional growth: 
 
--  slowing demand and softening prices in 2005 for commodities 
produced in and exported from the region, including iron ore, 
wood products, pulp, and rubber products; 
 
--  a soft tourism market in 2004 may indicate that the boom 
years for tourism are over and that there will be fewer new 
opportunities for growth in this sector.  One bright spot for 
tourism is cruise ship arrivals, which continue to climb from 
their 2002 slump; 
 
--  declines in housing starts to 1991-94 levels; 
 
--  a significant drop in consumer spending including for new 
cars; 
 
--  declining job growth after summer 2004 peaks. 
 
3.  The strength of the Canadian dollar is likely to have a 
significant impact on Atlantic Canadian businesses, and the APEC 
forecast anticipates that exports will take a hit in 2005. 
Businesses in the region and across the country will need to 
examine how to cut costs and increase productivity to compensate 
for the high loonie.  One silver lining of the Canadian dollar\'s 
rise is that capital investment in the form of imported 
machinery could become relatively cheap and spark a capital 
spending boom such as the one in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
 (NOTE:  We have converted Canadian dollar figures to U.S. 
dollars at a rate of US$0.82 = C$1.00.  END NOTE.) 
 
4.  On the bright side for the region\'s economy, Chaundy noted 
that federal government investment will help ease provincial 
budget squeezes, with higher than anticipated equalization 
payments and additional transfers for health care.  In the case 
of Nova Scotia the federal windfall will amount to about 3.6% of 
total provincial revenue, a roughly C$200 (US$164) million 
boost.  (That is offset, however, by an approximately 7% boost 
in the province\'s health care spending.)  In addition, major 
project spending -- such as offshore energy, mining, road 
building and liquefied natural gas plants -- should rise by 
about 12% across the region, with most of the increase in 
Newfoundland/Labrador and New Brunswick.  Announced projects, 
however, run out by mid-2006, leaving a potential \"project gap\" 
until mid-2008 when Lower Churchill Falls Hydro construction and 
the Deep Panuke offshore project potentially kick in. 
 
NOVA SCOTIA 
----------- 
 
5.  Atlantic Canada\'s largest economy, according to the APEC 
forecast, will grow by approximately 2.2% this year and 2.5% in 
2005.  Increases in services and manufacturing are and will 
continue to offset declines in offshore energy production.  The 
unemployment rate will continue its gradual decline, from about 
12% ten years ago to under 9% in 2005.  Strong employment growth 
in business services in recent years has helped both cut 
unemployment and raise the participation rate in the economy. 
Major project spending for 2005 will be a mix of public and 
private initiatives including an LNG plant in Cape Breton, 
cleanup of the Halifax harbor and the notoriously polluted 
Sydney Tar Ponds, the Sable Island natural gas compression 
platform and a major expansion of the community college system\'s 
infrastructure. 
 
6.  Nova Scotia\'s main export market by far is the U.S., with 
2004 exports to date -- C$3.2 (US$2.6) billion -- running about 
4% ahead of last year.  Primary exports to the U.S. are natural 
gas (21%), fish (21%) and tires (13%).  Offshore energy 
exploration has fallen sharply since 2003 and production is 
projected to level off at around 4.5 billion cubic meters in 
2004 and 2005.  APEC\'s Chaundy noted that something is needed to 
rekindle interest in Nova Scotia\'s offshore energy resources if 
the sector is to play a major role in stimulating growth. 
 
NEW BRUNSWICK 
------------- 
 
7.  After solid growth of 4% in 2003, New Brunswick is likely to 
see about 2% growth in 2004 and about 2.7% in 2005. 
Unemployment will tend downward to just above 10%.  Major 
investment in 2005 will include an LNG plant outside of St. 
John, a federal/provincial highway project, new electric power 
infrastructure to better link NB Power to the Maine grid and 
permit more efficient energy imports and exports, and a new 
Molson brewery in Moncton.  New Brunswick\'s primary export to 
the U.S. -- 42% of the total -- is refined oil, making it by far 
the largest Atlantic exporter to the U.S. with C$5.7 (US$4.7) 
billion so far in 2004.  Overall exports to the U.S. are up by 
11% so far in 2004.  Paper and wood products account for about 
10% each of the province\'s remaining exports. 
 
NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR 
------------------------- 
 
8.  Economic growth in Newfoundland and Labrador was 6.5% in 
2003, driven primarily by oil production and investment in 
offshore energy, the APEC forecast sees Newfoundland/Labrador 
growth falling dramatically to 1.7% for 2004 and 1.2% in 2005. 
Unemployment will remain in the 16% range, with new jobs created 
in manufacturing, trade and construction but lost in the public 
service and health care.  The province\'s exports -- over half of 
which are refined and crude oil -- will be up slightly in 2004. 
The U.S. remains by far Newfoundland\'s largest export market -- 
over C$2.1 (US$1.7) billion so far in 2004 --  although exports 
to China -- mainly fresh and frozen seafood for processing -- 
are up so far this year by more than 29% to C$239 (US$196) 
million.  Business investment has played a major part in the NL 
economy in recent years, but it will slow in 2005 as initial 
spending begins on the White Rose offshore energy project, the 
Voisey\'s Bay, Labrador, nickel mine and mill and the St. John\'s 
harbor clean-up project.  White Rose should boost oil production 
-- and provincial economic growth -- significantly by 2006. 
 
PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND 
-------------------- 
 
9.  Tiny PEI, according to the APEC forecast, will move from 
less than 2% growth in 2004 to around 2.3% in 2005.  Low potato 
prices, which brought down farm receipts significantly in 2004, 
are a main factor in the Island\'s current sluggish growth. 
Processed potatoes make up over 30% of PEI\'s exports, with raw 
potatoes another 7% and fish and fish products more than 20%. 
Unemployment will remain in the 11% to 11.5% range.  Exports to 
the U.S. have fallen slightly so far in 2004 to C$362 (US$297) 
million.  No other country comes close to the U.S. as an export 
market for PEI, although fish exports to Japan are up this year 
by about 200% to C$11.2 (US$9.1) million. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10.  Overall the APEC forecast predicts that Atlantic Canada 
will trail the rest of the country in economic growth in 2004 
and 2005.  Offshore energy, which has been a major factor in 
growth for the region, is stalled for the moment, despite high 
prices which should normally trigger investment in the sector. 
Waning interest in the offshore, particularly Nova Scotia\'s 
after several disappointing exploratory wells, will take time to 
reverse. 
 
11.  APEC\'s President, Elizabeth Beale, told the conference that 
Atlantic Canadians need to take stock of how their economies are 
structured.  Dependence on exports of primary products -- mainly 
to the U.S. but increasingly to Asia -- means that \"we have a 
developed economy but Third World export patterns.\"   The goal 
of value-added processing at home remains as elusive as always, 
and structural factors such as labor costs and rigidities mean 
that Atlantic Canada will likely see an increasing flow of its 
products, such as iron ore and seafood, going to developing 
countries to be turned into finished products and sold either 
back to Canada or to the region\'s traditional export market, the 
United States.  Beale\'s analysis of Atlantic Canadian exports 
facing direct or indirect competition from Asia should be cause 
for serious thought among businesspeople in the region.

SUBJECT: ATLANTIC CANADA AND BSE 
 
REF: Halifax 042 
 
 
1.  Atlantic Canadian beef farmers are feeling the pinch of low 
beef prices brought about by the closing of the US borders to 
the shipment of live animals and all but a few choice cuts of 
beef.  The subsequent glut of the Canadian market and the 
insufficient slaughter capacity in Canada has caused a massive 
drop in the price of Atlantic Canadian beef.  The numbers are 
significant; the Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture estimates 
that the provincial livestock industry lost over C$23 million in 
2003.  The provincial and federal governments are pitching in to 
help offset the consequences of the border closures with a 
recent announcement from the Federal government to infuse the 
industry with C$488 million.  The provincial governments have 
been topping-up this aid, with programs designed to mitigate the 
effects of the crisis on their specific industries.  For 
example, Nova Scotia has contributed C$13 million to address 
income loss for Nova Scotian beef farmers. 
 
2.  The Atlantic Canadian livestock farmers contend that many of 
the Federal measures dealing with the BSE crisis are designed to 
address the concerns of Western beef farmers.  Although they 
laud Federal moves to strengthen Canada\'s tracking, tracing, and 
surveillance system in order to demonstrate high Canadian 
standards of animal and public health, producers are less 
supportive of the Federal plans to increase Canadian 
slaughtering capacity while temporarily decreasing supply 
through a series of set-asides.  Atlantic Canadian producers 
argue that the Federal programs interfere with existing regional 
solutions and offer little in the way of aid to Atlantic beef 
farmers. 
 
3. One of the biggest regional developments is the construction 
of a new beef plant on Prince Edward Island, funded through the 
purchase of stocks, or \"hooks,\" by members of the Atlantic Beef 
Producers Co-operative Ltd.  Scheduled to open in late November 
or early December, the plant will be federally inspected and 
therefore permitted to distribute its beef to the entire 
Atlantic region.    The PEI plant will produce its own brand of 
beef, the Atlantic Tender Beef Classic (ATBC), and will 
discourage producers from slaughtering cattle larger than 1400 
lbs to preserve the quality of the meat.  Producers hope to open 
a niche market in local supermarkets with an active marketing 
campaign encouraging the consumption of local beef. 
 
4.  It is the restriction to cows of less than 1400 lbs for the 
ATBC brand that makes the Federal set-aside program troublesome 
for Atlantic beef producers.  Any producer forced to set-aside 
cows under the Federal program would not have the freedom to 
sell those animals approaching the 1400 lbs cut-off.  All those 
cows that could not be sent to the PEI plant due to excess 
weight would then have to be sent to slaughtering plants in 
Ontario, potentially off-setting any Federal monetary incentives 
for set-asides.  Furthermore, the PEI Cattleman\'s Association 
noted that the benefits of this program will be felt indirectly 
through the use of set-asides in other provinces where there is 
insufficient slaughter capacity, resulting in a more stable 
price across Canada.  The Atlantic Canadian beef producers could 
take advantage of these prices without participating in the 
program and consequently without jeopardizing the new PEI plant. 
 Essentially, they could take a free ride. 
 
5.  The Atlantic Provinces are skeptical other Federal programs, 
arguing that the Canadian Agricultural Income Stabilization 
Program is administratively top-heavy and inefficient.  The 
funding received by farmers under this program is not sufficient 
given the complicated process necessary to secure it.  They also 
argue that the Federal government must develop measures to deal 
with Atlantic environmental concerns associated with deadstock. 
Burying carcasses is problematic due to high water tables, and 
the close proximity of feedlots to residential development makes 
visually unpleasant options like fence-line feeding unpopular. 
 
6.  With these developments, the Agriculture ministers from Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick, and PEI have agreed on a common approach 
for the upcoming federal, provincial and territorial agriculture 
ministers\' meeting in Ottawa.  Chris d\'Entremont, Nova Scotia\'s 
Minister of Agriculture notes that although the Federal measures 
were welcome, further negotiations need to be held between the 
provinces and the Federal government in order to develop 
regional strategies for Atlantic Canada\'s livestock industry. 
In the meantime, the Atlantic Provinces are attempting to aid 
ailing Atlantic Canadian beef producers by offering cash 
advances of C$100 per cow to be deducted later from CAIS claims. 
 
7. COMMENT:  All parties seem to agree on the necessity of 
improving Canada\'s tracing, tracking, and testing for BSE in 
order to reassure international trade partners as to the safety 
of Canadian beef.  However, although still anxious for the 
reopening of the US-Canada border to live cattle and all beef 
exports, Atlantic beef producers realize that in the meantime 
they must develop alternative strategies to prevent the death of 
the industry.  Hence the push to increase Canada\'s national 
slaughtering capacity and design marketing strategies 
encouraging the consummation of local beef products.  This will 
allow Canada to serve its own market and hopefully to stabilize 
the national price of beef. The construction of the PEI beef 
plant is an example of this move towards increased regional 
self-sufficiency. 
 
8.  At the same time, this plant will not be adequate to address 
all of the region\'s beef concerns, nor are the Federal measures 
sufficient to bridge the gap until the reopening of the border. 
Therefore, it is likely that the Atlantic Provinces will 
continue to exert pressure on the Federal government both to 
continue strong negotiations with the U.S. on beef exports -- 
especially during the upcoming visit of President Bush to Canada 
-- and to aid in developing federally funded solutions for the 
Atlantic region\'s beef producers. END COMMENT
