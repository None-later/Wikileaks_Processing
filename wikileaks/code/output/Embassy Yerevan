REFS: A) STATE 220237  B) YEREVAN 1701  C) YEREVAN 0165 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. REFTEL (A) ASKED FOR A REPORT ON \"POSSIBLE PKK- 
ARMENIAN\" LINKS AND INSTRUCTED EMBASSY YEREVAN TO 
\"CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION CLOSELY AND TO KEEP 
US INFORMED.\"  WE RAISED THE SUBJECT WITH FOREIGN 
MINISTER PAPAZYAN JULY 26 AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN 
ASKED THE SAME THING BY JOURNALISTS DURING HIS RECENT 
TRIP TO THE U.S.  HIS ANSWER IS  (AND WAS) THAT \"THERE 
ARE NO LINKS OF ANY KIND BETWEEN THE PKK AND THE 
GOVERNMENT OF ARMENIA, ALTHOUGH THERE MIGHT BE SUCH 
LINKS BETWEEN CERTAIN OPPOSITION GROUPS SUCH AS THE 
DASHNAKS.\"  WHEN WE ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT THE DASHNAKS HERE OR THOSE AT PARTY HEADQUARTERS 
IN ATHENS, HE REPLIED \"THERE\'S NO DIFFERENCE.\" 
 
3. THIS REPLY IS CONSISTENT WITH RESPONSES WE HAVE 
GOTTEN FROM SENIOR GOA OFFICIALS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR 
NOW, NOT ONLY REGARDING THE PKK BUT ALSO REGARDING ALL 
SORTS OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, AND PARTICULARLY THE 
ASALA.  REFTEL (B) WAS THIS EMBASSY\'S ATTEMPT TO TRACK 
DOWN THE BASIS OF RUMORS IN TURKEY ABOUT A PKK MAGAZINE 
BEING PUBLISHED IN ARMENIA.  IT TURNS OUT THAT THE 
MAGAZINE ONLY PUBLISHED TWO ISSUES, THAT THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF THE KURDS IN ARMENIA ARE NON-MUSLIM (AND 
APOLITICAL) YEZIDIS, AND THAT THE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF 
THIS MAGAZINE - ALTHOUGH PRONE TO EXAGGERATE THE LEVEL 
OF POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AMONG ARMENIA\'S SMALL 
KURDISH COMMUNITY - ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS NO PKK 
ACTIVITY INSIDE ARMENIA.  (COMMENT:  THIS MAKES SENSE; 
AT A TIME WHEN THE GOA IS TRYING TO DO ALL WITHIN ITS 
POWER TO ACHIEVE NORMAL RELATIONS WITH TURKEY, WHY 
WOULD IT WANT TO PROVOKE TURKEY BY ALLOWING PKK 
ACTIVITY WITHIN ITS BORDERS?  FURTHERMORE, THE GOA IS 
MAKING A MAXIMUM EFFORT TO CONFISCATE WEAPONRY OF ALL 
TYPES FROM CIVILIANS AND PUT IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE 
\"PROPER\" AUTHORITIES;  WHY WOULD IT COUNTENANCE THE 
TRAINING OF TERRORISTS WHO COULD ONE DAY BE TURNED 
AGAINST ANY TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY?) 
 
4. REFTEL (C) WAS AN OFFER TO DEMARCHE THE GOA ABOUT 
THE ALEGED PKK PRESENCE IN A SPECIFIC REGION AS 
REPORTED BY EMBASSY BAKU IN BAKU 0070.  ACCORDING TO 
OUR RECORDS, THE DEPARTMENT NEVER REPLIED TO THIS 
MESSAGE.  BUT WE HAVE BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT OF 
TERRORISM ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH A RANGE OF SENIOR 
OFFICIALS, ALL OF WHOM CONDEMN THE ASALA AND ALL OF ITS 
COUSINS IN THE TERRORIST WORLD.  THEIR ONE REGRET IN 
THIS AREA IS THAT -- AS THEY SEE IT -- THERE IS 
PRECIOUS LITTLE THEY CAN DO IF, FOR EXAMPLE,  THE 
DASHNAKS LIVING IN IRAN WANT TO FINANCE, TRAIN, OR 
EQUIP TERRORIST UNITS OPERATING - ILLEGITIMATELY AND IN 
DIRECT OPPOSITION TO GOA POLICY - IN THE NAME OF THE 
ARMENIAN PEOPLE.

TERRORIST ATTACKS 
 
 
1. (U) Classified by Ambassador John Ordway for reasons 1.5 
(b) and (d). 
 
2. (C) Summary:  The GOAM responded to the November 20 
terrorist attacks in Istanbul with a public statement of 
condemnation, followed by a telephone call by Armenian FM 
Oskanian to Turkish FM Gul on November 22.  The attacks, 
which attracted wide coverage in the local media and among 
everyday Armenians, were of particular interest to the GOAM 
given the large Armenian community in Istanbul and the 
initial press reports of damage to the Armenian Marmara 
Cultural Institute near the HSBC building.  The lead-up to 
the GOAM response (which only took place late November 21 
after FM Oskanian returned to Armenia from his travel to 
Kyrgyzstan) confirmed the active role Oskanian plays in the 
evolving Armenia-Turkey relationship.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
PUBLIC STATEMENT OFFERS CONDOLENCES 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The GOAM released a public statement the evening of 
November 21 condemning the recent terrorist attacks on the 
British Consulate and HSBC bank building in Istanbul. 
Note:  The statement was the first time the GOAM had 
reached out to Turkey in such a public fashion since the 
August 1999 earthquake in Turkey.  End note.  The attacks, 
which attracted wide coverage in the local media and among 
everyday Armenians, were of particular interest to the GOAM 
given the large Armenian community in Istanbul and the 
initial press reports of damage to the Armenian Marmara 
Cultural Institute near the HSBC building.  The November 22 
press release follows: 
 
Begin text:  The Republic of Armenia strongly condemns the 
terrorist acts which took place in Turkey, and which 
resulted in great human loss and destruction.  We express 
our sincere sympathies and condolences to the families of 
the victims, and to the governments and peoples of Turkey 
and the United Kingdom.  The Republic of Armenia 
unequivocally joins the international battle against 
terrorism which knows no borders and does not discriminate 
among nations and religions.  Terror acts in Turkey pose a 
threat to all humanity.  End text. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
OSKANIAN-GUL CALL FORMAL \"BUT FRIENDLY\" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In addition to the public statement, FM Oskanian 
made the rare move of calling Turkish FM Gul November 22 to 
express the GOAM\'s condolences.  The MFA told us that the 
call lasted ten minutes, had a \"protocolary but friendly\" 
tone, but did not include any offer for humanitarian 
support.  The call was the first time the two FMs had 
spoken since their meeting on the margins of UNGA in 
September.  The MFA Turkish Desk confirmed that Oskanian 
wanted to send the GOT a message that the GOAM \"understands 
domestic tragedies and expects the Government of Turkey to 
do its part to fight terrorists.\"  Oskanian reportedly told 
MFA colleagues following the telephone call that the 
attacks must not unduly postpone the GOAM\'s ongoing 
dialogue with the GOT regarding opening the Armenia-Turkey 
border. 
 
5. (C) Comment:  The process leading up to the GOAM 
response confirmed the active role Oskanian plays in the 
Armenia-Turkey relationship.  High and mid-level officials 
inside the MFA and the President\'s Office were unwilling to 
move on this issue until Oskanian returned from his trip to 
Kyrgyzstan.  Oskanian\'s role is so central in this issue 
that the GOAM preferred to let the condolence message go 
out two days after the fact rather than change regular 
interlocutors and risk interrupting the evolving 
relationship between the two countries.

SUBJECT: ARMENIA: ONLY CONCERN IS GEORGIA\'S STABILITY 
 
 
1. (U) Classified by Ambassador John Ordway. Reasons: 
1.5 (B)&(D). 
 
2. (C) Summary.  Following the resignation of Georgian 
President Shevardnadze, the Armenian leadership and 
government officials have maintained an official line 
that the stability of their neighbor is Armenia\'s 
paramount concern.  Government officials have 
indicated that they are prepared to work with whomever 
emerges as the political leader of Georgia. The GOAM 
worries that continued post-election turmoil and a 
prolonged political crisis in Georgia could have a 
substantial negative impact on Armenia\'s economy.  End 
summary. 
 
3. (SBU) In public statements throughout the day, the 
Armenian leadership has focused on the urgent need to 
restore order and stability in Georgia following the 
resignation of President Shevardnadze.  In a statement 
released November 24, President Kocharian called for 
the \"the quick establishment of order and stability in 
Georgia,\" and stated he looked forward to developing a 
\"good personal relationship\" with the new leaders of 
the country.  According to wire reports, National 
Assembly Speaker Artur Baghdasarian spoke by telephone 
with Georgia\'s Interim President Nino Burjanadze and 
expressed hope that law and order would soon be 
established in Georgia.  Foreign Minister Vardan 
Oskanian held a press conference in which he focused 
on the need to maintain stability throughout the 
region. 
 
4. (SBU) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Head of the 
Georgia Desk, Ara Baldayan, informed us that Armenia 
was only interested in the quick imposition of order 
in Georgia and that the GOAM was prepared to work with 
whomever ultimately assumed the leadership of the 
country.  Baldayan declined to respond to questions 
regarding what contacts have been made between the 
GOAM and the new Georgian leadership, except to say 
that the GOAM will remain in contact with the 
\"legitimate authorities.\" 
 
5. (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Tatul Margarian 
stressed the importance of Georgia\'s stability to 
Armenia during the Strategic Dialogue discussions held 
November 20, before Shevardnadze\'s resignation. 
Margarian commented that a continued deterioration of 
the situation in Georgia could only adversely affect 
Armenia\'s economic growth and consequently the GOAM 
was currently more interested in \"stability in Georgia 
than within our own borders.\"  Margarian said that the 
GOAM would work with whomever emerged in power in 
Tblisi, and that \"perhaps it is time for change in 
Georgia.\"  Margarian held out hope for an \"elite 
resolution,\" which would preferably limit the power of 
Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze. 
 
6.  (SBU) There has been no significant interruption 
in Armenia\'s vital trade links through Georgia. 
According to the Chief Border Guard at the Bagratashen 
border with Georgia, the primary entry point for all 
goods coming to Armenia, freight traffic between the 
two countries is keeping to schedule.  After a brief 
interruption in shipments over the weekend, both 
trucks and trains have resumed their normal schedules. 
Reports from private exporting and importing companies 
confirm that deliveries are leaving and arriving on 
time. 
 
7. (C) Comment.  The stability of Georgia is indeed of 
prime importance to the GOAM.  Official government 
figures indicate that 80 percent of all Armenian trade 
transited through Georgia in 2002, and the Georgian 
ports of Poti and Batumi provide Armenia\'s sole access 
to European markets.  Georgia also provides the land 
routes connecting Armenia with Russia, its largest 
trading partner.  The GOAM fears any further 
destabilization of Georgia, whether through a 
breakdown in central government authority or efforts 
by regional separatists to take advantage of the 
ongoing political crisis.  The cautious public tone 
taken by the GOAM underscores the government\'s desire 
not to contribute in any way to the exacerbation of 
tensions in Georgia particularly given substantial 
adverse effects on Armenia.  While the public appears 
to share this concern, there is already a lot of 
private discussion of the potential impact on 
Armenia\'s own domestic political life.  While Armenia 
is likely to remain stable and calm, the longer-term 
impact could be significant-- and will certainly be a 
major factor in the thinking of both President 
Kocharian and opposition leaders as they continue to 
jockey for political advantage. End comment.

MEMBERSHIP OBLIGATIONS 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Under substantial pressure from the Council of 
Europe, the Armenian National Assembly (NA) voted 
September 9 to create the position of Human Rights 
Ombudsman to oversee the human rights situation the 
country.  Numerous human rights NGOs and the Council of 
Europe itself have voiced serious misgivings about the 
independence of the ombudsman, and urged the National 
Assembly to enact further legislation to provide 
greater parliamentary oversight of the position and 
further define the ombudsman\'s duties.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
OMBUDSMAN LAW FINALLY PASSED 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) As part of its membership obligations to the 
Council Of Europe (COE), Armenia was required to create 
the position of a Human Rights Ombudsman, an individual 
who would take responsibility for the protection of 
human rights and civil liberties in the country.  In 
September 2002, a COE investigative panel found Armenia 
generally negligent in adopting the legislative reforms 
required by the body, and set a deadline of January 
2004 for their adoption.  To meet the COE\'s deadline, 
the government has aggressively pushed several high- 
profile human rights related bills through the National 
Assembly (NA) during the fall 2003 session.  The NA 
passed the bill creating the ombudsman position 
September 9, and President Kocharian signed it into 
law.  Under the Armenian constitution, the president 
would appoint the ombudsman and, according to several 
government sources, he is likely to do so by the end of 
the year. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
COE: OMBUDSMAN BILL NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) According to Natalia Vutova, Special 
Representative of the COE Secretary-General in Armenia, 
Armenia\'s ombudsman bill does not meet COE standards. 
Vutova contends that both the COE and OSCE have very 
explicit requirements for human rights ombudsmen, 
including its complete independence from executive 
authority.  Under the current Armenian constitutional 
framework, the National Assembly is not empowered to 
review the president\'s selection for the ombudsman 
post, which would be under executive administration. 
Vutova stated that the COE requires \"not just laws to 
be adopted, but the right laws with the right content.\" 
The ombudsman law, along with draft laws on alternative 
military service and the media, falls short of meeting 
COE requirements. 
 
-------------------------------- 
HUMAN RIGHTS NGOs ALSO SKEPTICAL 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Human rights NGOs, including the Helsinki 
Commission, the International Union of Lawyers, and the 
Armenian Union of Journalists, organized a seminar in 
October 2003 to discuss the shortcomings of the 
ombudsman law.  Most agreed that the lack of 
independence of the ombudsman would make the post 
nearly as ineffective at examining the human rights 
situation as the Presidential Commission on Human 
Rights, which has not held hearings on any issue in a 
year.  The Helsinki Commission of Armenia noted that in 
a frantic rush to meet the COE deadline, the NA was 
passing ineffectual human rights laws.  Helsinki 
Commission Chairman Avetik Ishkhanyan said to the 
press, \"It seems that Armenian authorities are in a 
hurry to [fulfill] several [COE] obligations, but they 
don\'t care how they are going to do that.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
CANDIDATE FOR OMBUDSMAN NOTES LAW\'S SHORTCOMINGS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6. (SBU) Larissa Alaverdian, a member of the 
President\'s Commission on Human Rights and former 
parliamentarian, pointed to additional shortcomings in 
the ombudsman law.  She contended that the ombudsman 
law had serious structural flaws, and would have to be 
amended.  According to Alaverdian, the ombudsman\'s 
duties are not clearly defined, nor is the position\'s 
relationship to other government agencies.  Alverdian 
stated that another concern is that the ombudsman does 
not have an independent budget, and would have to rely 
on the executive branch to fund its operations. 
Alverdian confirmed recent press speculation that she 
is one of three finalists for the ombudsman position, 
and, despite her misgivings about the law, she told us 
she would accept and welcome the appointment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
COMMENT: COE CONCERNS MAY RESULT IN PUNITIVE ACTION 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7. (SBU) The concerns raised by the COE over the 
ombudsman law highlight its disagreement with the GOAM 
over what membership obligations to the organization 
entail.  Armenia\'s seeming indifference to the COE 
protests over the content of its human rights 
legislation, including bills on alternative military 
service, the media, and the ombudsman, and its 
continued failure to meet deadlines for constitutional 
reform could have negative consequences for its 
membership in the organization.  The Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe has commissioned a 
report on Armenia that will be released in January 2004 
that will address the dispute over Armenia\'s membership 
obligations.  Vutova said that based on the report, 
which will also include a review of the flawed Armenian 
2003 presidential and parliamentary elections, PACE may 
decide to impose punitive actions, such as the 
suspension of the Armenian delegation\'s voting 
privileges.

2. (C) Summary.  The seventh US-Armenian Strategic Dialogue 
took place in Yerevan November 20.  The sides discussed 
regional security, defense cooperation, and cooperation on 
counter-terrorism.  The delegation heads, EUR DAS Lynn Pascoe 
and Deputy Foreign Minister Tatul Margarian t examined issues 
of regional concern and identified future areas of 
cooperation.  Though the Ministry of Defense registered 
reservations regarding a defense assessment and the 
deployment of additional forces to Iraq, the meeting was 
generally upbeat and positively assessed US-Armenian 
cooperation to date. End summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
I. Regional Security Issues 
---------------------------- 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Turkey: \"Incremental\" Progress towards Normalization 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3. (C)  Karen Mirzoyan, Head of the MFA\'s Middle East 
Department, stated that relations with Turkey remained the 
most important issue in Armenia,s foreign policy.  He 
confirmed that recurring contact between the GOAM and GOT had 
taken place at the ministerial level.  Mirzoyan also reported 
some progress in efforts to open the border between the two 
countries, as the GOT had seemingly relaxed its stand on 
pre-conditions to opening the border. The GOAM supported 
incremental steps towards reconciliation even before 
establishment of diplomatic relations.  This policy included 
a recent proposal by Foreign Minister Oskanian that the GOAM 
and GOT formally announce an open border for diplomatic 
passport holders and third country nationals, and would also 
entail greater contact between Armenian and Turkish 
businessmen.  Deputy Foreign Minister Tatul Margarian said 
that economic relations with Turkey were of increasing 
importance, considering the continued instability in Georgia, 
Armenia,s prime commercial conduit.  DAS Pascoe stated that 
the senior GOT leadership had recently indicated that their 
policy towards Armenia did not make practical sense.  He 
encouraged the GOAM to engage in active public relations 
measures to undermine falsehoods in the Armenian public,s 
perceptions about Turks and Turkey. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Iran: A Strategic Partner By Default? 
------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C)  Mirzoyan, who is also responsible for Iran, stated 
that due in large part to Armenia\'s political and economic 
isolation, Iran remained an important strategic partner.  He 
said that Armenia had three aims in its policy with Iran: a 
strategic partnership that sought to balance the influence of 
Turkey in the region; energy partnerships that would lessen 
Armenia,s dependence on other suppliers; and trade and 
transportation ties that help to relieve the effects of the 
closed borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey.  Pascoe reiterated 
US concerns over Iran,s WMD programs, human rights abuses 
and support for terrorist groups. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Georgia: Stability Vital, But Lacking 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Margarian joked that at times it seemed the GOAM was 
more interested in stability in Georgia that within its own 
borders.  He expressed concern that continued disturbances in 
Georgia after the recent parliamentary elections could have a 
large impact on Armenia,s continued economic growth.  The 
GOAM was particularly worried about the deteriorating 
situation in Ajaria, a transit area for part of Armenia,s 
trade with Europe and Russia (note. Most trade moves through 
Poti rather than Batumi.  End note.).  Margarian speculated 
that it was perhaps time for change in Georgia, but stated 
that the GOAM is prepared to work with whomever is in power 
in Tblisi (though they feared an increased role for Ajarian 
leader Aslan Abashidze).  Pascoe agreed that the situation in 
Ajaria was troubling, with Abashidze apparently making a play 
for increased political power, and urged the GOAM to take any 
steps it could to calm the situation.  (Note. The meetings 
were held in the week prior to Shevardnadze\'s resignation on 
November 23. End note.). 
------------------------------------- 
Azerbaijan: \"Relations Close to Zero\" 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Margarian acknowledged that in the past year, 
\"relations with Azerbaijan were close to zero.\"  He said that 
the GOAM was waiting to see if newly elected Azeri President 
Aliyev would take any initiative to resolve the Karabakh 
conflict, and that Armenia was prepared to restart 
negotiations if Aliyev desired.  Pascoe expressed optimism 
that Aliyev would wanted to move forward in relations with 
Armenia, but both sides had to take substantive steps to 
prepare their respective publics for inevitable compromises 
and concessions. 
-------------------------------------------- 
Iraq:  No Decision on Additional Deployments 
-------------------------------------------- 
7. (S) Margarian expressed hope that the situation in Iraq in 
Iraq would soon stabilize and a thorough re-building process 
could get underway.  He noted that Armenia had a particular 
interest in a secure environment in Iraq, considering the 
long-term effects for regional stability and the difficulties 
faced by ethnic Armenians in the country.  The GOAM was 
concerned that the lack of adequate medical facilities and 
schools in Iraq would lead to the emigration of the Armenian 
population.  Margarian confirmed the GOAM,s desire to 
contribute to stability operations in Iraq, stating, \"it is 
our duty to participate in this mission.\"  He indicated that 
Armenia and Kuwait would soon conclude a SOFA agreement, 
initiated after Armenia volunteered to deploy medical and 
demining units to Iraq.  Pascoe raised the issue of the 
recent request by the United States for Armenian deployment 
of 50 military cargo trucks and ten tractors for combat 
support operations.  Margarian acknowledged receipt of the 
request, and stated that he wished it had been made earlier. 
The GOAM hoped to have an answer to the United States soon. 
 
----------------------- 
II. Defense Cooperation 
----------------------- 
 
-------------------- 
Current Cooperation 
-------------------- 
 
8. (C) Major-General Mikhail Melkonian, Head of the Foreign 
Liaison Department at the Ministry of Defense, provided an 
overview of two years of U.S.-Armenian military cooperation. 
Melkonian stated his belief that the previous day,s meeting 
between Deputy EUCOM commander General Charles Wald had 
\"strengthened and crystallized the relationship.\"  Melkonian 
identified four main areas of cooperation: U.S. assistance in 
military communication upgrades; U.S.-supported military 
education programs; the Humanitarian Demining Program; and 
the State Partnership Program initiated with the Kansas 
National Guard.  Melkonian welcomed Armenia\'s recent 
signature of the NATO PfP SOFA, though he blamed the delay in 
the signing of the document on NATO.  He further pressed the 
United States to agree to the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing 
Agreement.  According to Melkonian, the two agreements 
\"provided full legal basis for our cooperation.\"  Pascoe 
reiterated that the US valued its partnership with Armenia, 
though the partnership had not developed as quickly as the 
United States had hoped.  Pascoe stressed the need to speed 
progress, but \"at a pace that is comfortable to you.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Broadening Cooperation: Defense Assessment, Art. 98, Iraq 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
9. (C) Pascoe raised US priorities for future defense 
cooperation.  He stressed the prime importance of Armenia 
allowing a defense assessment by the United States.  Pascoe 
explained that the assessment would be of use to justify FMF 
funding requests to Congress, and assist the Armenian Armed 
Forces in identifying areas in which their forces could be 
reformed and made more efficient.  Melkonian raised strong 
objections to an assessment, questioning its necessity as the 
United States was \"fully familiar\" with the Armenian defense 
structure.  Melkonin asserted that defense reform could not 
even be considered until settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
dispute, and that the current priority was maintaining 
existing forces.  Pascoe responded by reiterating that an 
assessment was not \"an intelligence issue,\" and that if 
Armenia was concerned over the intrusiveness of the action, 
than third parties could be found and involved. 
10. (C) Melkonian praised ongoing U.S.-Armenian military 
education and exchange programs but added that he would 
welcome greater coordination in order to ensure that courses 
met the needs of the Armenian military.  He requested that 
Armenia be allowed to use some of its IMET funding to improve 
military education institutions in Armenia. 
 
11. (C) Joan Corbett, Special Advisor to Under Secretary 
Bolton, stressed the importance of quickly concluding an 
Article 98 agreement.  She stated that the agreements could 
take many forms, and were being sought with all countries. 
Corbett acknowledged that while Armenia is not yet party to 
the Rome Statute, conclusion of an Article 98 agreement with 
the United States would serve to broaden defense cooperation. 
 
12. (S) While discussing the future of US-Armenian defense 
cooperation, General Melkonian stated that he doubted Armenia 
could meet the U.S. request for additional combat support 
service deployment to Iraq.  He said that it would be 
\"difficult at this time\" to provide the number of trucks 
requested by the United States. 
 
-------------------------- 
Future of Demining Program 
-------------------------- 
 
13. (C) Ambassador Ordway expressed his hope that the GOAM 
will focus attention on developing a \"superstructure\" for the 
Humanitarian Demining Program.  He identified three necessary 
developments for the program: the need to do a thorough mine 
survey in Armenia; the realization of civilian control of the 
program through the National Demining Action Committee; and, 
the creation of an effective marketing campaign to sell the 
program to the international donor community.  The Ambassador 
urged the GOAM to move forward on these issues in the 
following year, and not solely focus their demining efforts 
on continued training. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
III.  Cooperation on Counter-Terrorism Issues 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
Counter- Terrorism, Non-Proliferation, and Export Control 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
14. (C) Tigran Agajarian, Head of the Counterintelligence 
Division at the National Security Service, presented 
Armenia,s counter-terrorism and non-proliferation efforts. 
He encouraged increased cooperation between the USG and GOAM 
in sharing intelligence about terrorist activities.  He noted 
the that the National Assembly had recently passed a bill 
establishing export controls for dual use goods, and 
requested U.S. assistance in training Armenian experts in 
this area. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
15. (S) Though the delegations were in general agreement on 
the issues discussed, some fissures were evident, including 
on the Armenian side.  The Ministry of Defense and Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs appear to be at odds over the recent U.S. 
request for additional combat support forces to be deployed 
to Iraq.  While Deputy Foreign Minister Margarian promised an 
answer to the request quickly and hoped for a \"positive 
response,\" the MOD representative dismissed the request as 
unfeasible at this time.  The MOD also seems strongly against 
any defense assessment undertaken by the United States, and 
denied that any reform of the military was necessary at this 
time.

REFS: STATE 323552; STATE 326263 
 
1.  SUMMARY: Per reftels, Yerevan participated in 
several activities focused on raising AIDS awareness in 
Armenia, including an online chat, the launching of a 
website and an information seminar on the facts about 
HIV/AIDS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. On December 1, Ambassador Ordway kicked off an 
online chat and AIDS awareness seminar at an ECA-funded 
Armenian School Connectivity Program internet computer 
center.  The online session linked forty students and 
their health education teachers in nine regions with 
experts from UNDP, World Vision and local NGOs. 
Ambassador Ordway sent a message highlighting the 
importance of knowing the facts about HIV/AIDS and 
education\'s power as a tool to fight the spread of the 
disease.  The experts then took over for an hour-long 
question and answer session.  Ambassador Ordway also 
took questions from media present about US policies and 
initiatives in the global fight on AIDS.  Seven 
television stations included his comments and footage 
from the chat during their prime-time newscasts. 
 
3.  PAS attended a presentation of the launch of an 
informational website about HIV/AIDS hosted through the 
ECA-funded Internet Access and Training Program. IREX, 
the project implementer, invited members of the NGO and 
international donor community along with local health 
officials to attend, listen to a presentation by a 
local AIDS awareness youth NGO and participate in a 
roundtable discussion on the HIV/AIDS situation in 
Armenia. 
 
4.  PAS attended an AIDS awareness seminar for 
Community Connections alumni hosted at the ECA-funded 
Educational Information Center.  The APAO opened the 
session with a few comments on the importance of 
understanding that AIDS can happen to anyone and that 
while Armenia has not suffered from a high rate of HIV 
infection, only widespread education about AIDS/HIV 
prevention will keep it that way.  A guest speaker from 
the National AIDS Prevention Center introduced 
materials and resources developed by the center.  A 
Peace Corps Health Volunteer discussed HIV/AIDS-related 
projects and activities in Armenia. 
 
5.  PAS also translated Secretary Powell\'s World AIDS 
Day message into Armenian and distributed it among the 
media.  His message was covered by most television 
stations, posted by Arminfo news agency in full and 
published in two major dailies, Hayastani Hanrapetutiun 
and AYB-FE, in part.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (U) PAS invited 11 students from the political 
science department of Yerevan State University to the 
Embassy November 26 to discuss their perceptions of the 
\'velvet revolution\' in neighboring Georgia with poloff 
and econoff.  The students provided an interesting 
commentary not just on events in Georgia, but also on 
the Armenian political opposition, Armenia\'s relations 
with the rest of world, and generational gaps in 
political consciousness.  The students generally 
favored stability over striking political change, and 
argued that Armenia\'s future would necessarily be 
linked to Russia\'s.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
THE STUDENTS: REPRESENTING A SMALL BUT DISTINCT GROUP 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3. (U) We invited 11 undergraduate students majoring in 
political science at Yerevan State University to the 
Embassy November 26 for a roundtable discussion on the 
recent events in Georgia.  The students were all 
proficient English speakers, and 10 had spent some time 
in the United States (the other had lived and studied 
in Moscow for seven years), eight in the FSA-funded 
FLEX program (for high school students) and two in the 
Undergraduate Program.  They described their parents as 
educated, and agreed that their families belonged to 
the emerging Armenian middle class.  They asserted that 
their foreign language skills and time spent abroad did 
not separate them from the majority of other students 
studying similar coursework at Yerevan State.  On all 
the issues discussed, from the political opposition in 
Armenia to relations with Turkey, the students held 
generally uniform views that they claimed were 
representative of their peers at the university. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
GOOD FOR THE GEORGIANS, BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR ECONOMY? 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4. (U) The students\' initial comments about the 
situation in Georgia focused on its strategic impact on 
Armenia.  The students pointed out that any sustained 
period of instability in Georgia could have 
\"catastrophic\" consequences for the Armenian economy. 
They argued that even a short-lived crisis could have a 
dramatic impact on Armenia\'s supplies of everything 
from power to consumer goods.  Some students 
hypothesized that if Georgia were to descend into 
chaos, the United States would be forced to place 
substantial pressure on Turkey to open its border with 
Armenia to avert a humanitarian crisis.  When pressed, 
the students addressed their perceptions of the \"velvet 
revolution\" in Tbilisi.  They all agreed that they were 
\"proud\" and \"glad for\" the Georgians, who, they felt, 
were living in an incredibly corrupt and \"failed\" 
state.  One student observed that \"all the 
preconditions for revolution\" were in place in Georgia. 
 
------------- 
WHY NOT HERE? 
------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The students also agreed that the situation in 
Armenia after the presidential and parliamentary 
elections earlier in the year was completely different 
than that in Georgia.  While the students acknowledged 
that there were clearly some falsifications in the 
Armenian elections, they believed the outcomes were not 
seriously altered.  Unlike Georgia, Armenia had 
registered substantial improvements in the standard of 
living over the past four to five years, and the 
students argued that most people did not see the need 
for the government to deviate greatly from its current 
policies.  Most important, however, was the lack of a 
viable opposition.  The students stated that aside from 
not having an effective agenda, the opposition in 
Armenia did not have effective leaders.  The students 
could point to no one, in politics or not, who they 
found either inspiring or a worthy challenger to the 
current political elite.   The students concurred with 
one of their colleague\'s statement that \"Stepan 
Demirchian (head of the opposition Justice Bloc in the 
National Assembly, and failed candidate for president) 
would be no one if he didn\'t look like his father\" 
(former National Assembly Speaker Karen Demirchian 
assassinated in 1999, who remains a hero in the hearts 
and minds of the opposition). 
 
------------------ 
GENERATIONAL SPLIT 
------------------ 
 
6. (U) The students stated that they and their friends 
in the university felt Armenia was generally on the 
right track, and by definition they were \"pro- 
stability\" and not active in politics.  All but one of 
the eleven students voted for incumbent President 
Kocharian in the March 2003 run-off election, and they 
laughed when the one dissenter declared she voted for 
Demirchian because \"he wasn\'t as corrupt.\" (Note: The 
student who voted for Demirchian said that she did not 
attend any opposition rallies, as those were for the 
\"unemployed.\"  End Note.)  They agreed that their views 
were generally representative of their classmates, but 
diverged from those of educated Armenians 10-15 years 
older.  Armenians in their thirties, whose formative 
experiences included the break-up of the Soviet Union 
and the difficult early transition years, were more 
likely to be active in the political process and have a 
more reformist outlook than students currently studying 
in the university, they maintained.  The students felt 
that the mentality of the slightly older educated 
generation remained shaped by the political idealism of 
the late 1980\'s and early 1990\'s. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
\"RUSSIA IS A TRUE FRIEND\" 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The students agreed that Russia was Armenia\'s 
\"best friend.\"  When asked what it meant to be \"pro- 
Russian\", one student stated that it was a recognition 
of the cultural ties between Russians and Armenians and 
the \"strategic reality\" of Armenia\'s geography and 
current political isolation.  They said that most 
professors in the university espoused this philosophy, 
which was reinforced by parents at home.  The students 
hoped that Russia would move ideologically \"westward\" 
and consequently help pull Armenia into Europe, but 
claimed that Armenia could not independently decide 
upon that path.  The students voiced substantial 
resentment of Turkey owing to the economic hardships 
imposed by the Turkish blockade rather than the events 
of 1915.  They viewed the United States as guilty by 
association, having chosen to align itself with Turkey, 
and therefore having decided not push too hard for the 
opening of the border.  While the students seemed to 
respect American ideals, they felt a much closer bond 
with Russia and Russians who had shown unwavering 
support for Armenia. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) The roundtable discussion with the students 
exposed two interesting, and perhaps surprising, 
characteristics that they claimed were also 
representative of their peers at the university. 
First, the students were politically conservative. 
They generally approved of the current state of affairs 
in Armenia and stressed the importance of continued 
stability in the country.  Instead of noting that the 
Armenian opposition had legitimate concerns over the 
conduct of the 2003 elections, the students expressed 
relief that demonstrations and protests were short- 
lived and not destabilizing.  Even more significant, 
despite their experiences in the United States, the 
students described themselves as \"pro-Russian.\"  They 
did not feel that the strategic need to be strongly 
aligned with Russia had any notable negative effect on 
Armenia, nor did it contradict with integration into 
Euro-Atlantic structures.  These two opinions, if 
widely held, indicate that Armenians who will be 
expected to fill leadership positions in 15-20 years do 
not hold views on domestic or foreign policy that 
differ significantly from those of the current 
political leadership.

1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Concluding a nearly three-year trial, a 
Yerevan district court handed down six life sentences 
and one 14-year prison term December 2 to the 
defendants convicted of carrying out the October 1999 
National Assembly shooting that killed the Prime 
Minister, Parliamentary Speaker and six other political 
leaders.  Relatives of those killed in the attack, 
including opposition leader Stepan Demirchian, charged 
that President Kocharian had manipulated the trial 
process to prevent the release of potentially 
incriminating information about his administration. 
Opposition leaders also blasted the government\'s 
failure to seek the death penalty for the assailants, 
despite the fact that capital punishment was abolished 
in August.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
TRIAL FINALLY CONCLUDES 
----------------------- 
 
3. (U) Judge Samvel Uzunian of the Nork Marash District 
Court handed down life sentences to six of the seven 
defendants convicted of murder and terrorism for their 
role in the October 27, 1999 National Assembly 
shootings that killed Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsian, 
Speaker Karen Demirchian and six others.  The accused 
mastermind of the plot, Nairi Hunanian, his brother 
Karen, and four accomplices received the highest 
penalty under Armenian law, with the seventh defendant 
receiving a 14-year prison term.  The trial lasted for 
nearly three years. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT CONSPIRACY THEORIES 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4. (U) Despite Nairi Hunanian\'s numerous pronouncements 
that he had organized the assassination in an effort to 
root out corruption in the government, many Armenians 
still believe that a broader conspiracy successfully 
eliminated the Sargsian-Demirchian power center. 
Though lacking any direct evidence, the victim\'s 
relatives and opposition leaders have variously charged 
President Kocharian with manipulating the trial, 
covering-up important government information related to 
the case, and even direct involvement in the attacks to 
increase his own political power.  Leader of the 
opposition Justice Bloc and son of the late Karen 
Demirchian, Stepan Demirchian told the press after the 
verdict, \"The trial was manipulated right from the 
beginning, and the court has carried out an order.  The 
authorities have done everything to cover up this 
crime.\"   Kocharian and his allies have vigorously 
denied any involvement in the murders, and the Embassy 
has never seen any evidence to the contrary. 
 
--------------------------- 
DEATH PENALTY NOT AN OPTION 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (U) One controversial element of the sentencing was 
the fact that none of the defendants received the death 
penalty.  (NOTE:  Many Armenians had assumed that those 
convicted for involvement in National Assembly 
shootings would be executed.  END NOTE.)  In order to 
fulfill its Council of Europe membership obligations 
the National Assembly formally abolished capital 
punishment in September, before the conclusion of the 
trial.  Demirchian and other opposition leaders had 
argued that the ban against the death penalty only 
applied in peacetime, and since the attack had been an 
act of war, the defendants would still be eligible for 
capital punishment. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) Although opposition charges leveled against 
President Kocharian of complicity in the 1999 events 
have never gained traction, the government appears to 
hope that the conviction and sentencing of Nairi 
Hunanian and his accomplices will finally close the 
books on this particular episode in Armenian recent 
history.

RESERVED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  On October 6-9, 2003, Embassy\'s BISNIS 
representative visited the Armenian province of Kotayk 
to explore investment and trade opportunities for U.S. 
companies and to expand U.S.-Armenian commercial ties. 
He met with the province\'s business leaders and 
government officials.  This is another in a series of 
regional trips to reach out to companies throughout the 
country to promote the BISNIS \"Search for Partners\" and 
\"Trade and Tenders\" programs and collect information on 
investment and commercial opportunities for U.S. 
companies.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
Kotayk:  General Background 
--------------------------- 
 
2.  Kotayk province is located in the central part of 
Armenia.  The province was formed in 1996 and includes 
three former administrative regions:  Hrazdan, Abovian 
and Nairi, with a total area of 797 sq. miles.  Based 
on the figures provided by Kotayk Mayor\'s office, 
Kotayk has 281,000 inhabitants, divided between 153,600 
urban residents and 127,400 rural residents.  The 
climate is mild continental.  Kotayk\'s mineral 
resources include a wide range of building materials, 
e.g., basalt, tufa, perlite and marble.  The province 
also has a large number of mineral water springs 
located near Arzni, Hankavan, and Bjni. 
 
3.  Due to its proximity to Yerevan, Kotayk is one of 
the most developed provinces of Armenia.  Its 
industrial sector includes 170 large, medium and small 
enterprises with total output reaching approximately 
USD 80 million in 2003.  Most companies in Kotayk are 
located in the province\'s three major cities:  Hrazdan 
(capital of Kotayk), Abovian and Charentsavan. 
 
----------- 
Key Sectors 
----------- 
 
4.  Key sectors represented in Kotayk include: 
 
--Energy 
The Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant (HTPP) and the Sevan- 
Hrazdan Hydropower Plant (SHHP) cascade have a combined 
installed capacity of 1,660 MW.  The assets of the HTTP 
were transferred to the Government of the Russian 
Federation against Armenia\'s debt to Russia.  The Sevan- 
Hrazdan Cascade valued at USD 25 million was 
transferred to Russia\'s RAO Unified Energy Systems as 
well for debts Armenia owed to Russia for fuel for 
Armenia\'s nuclear power station. 
 
--Diamond-cutting 
A number of successful diamond-cutting enterprises are 
located in the villages of Nor Hajn and Nor Geghi. 
Among them Shoghakn, Lori and Arevakn plants belong to 
foreign investors.  Aghavni and Andranik plants are 
operated and owned by local entrepreneurs.  Lori, owned 
by Haik Arslanian, a businessman of Armenian origin 
from Antwerp, Belgium, employs 400 highly qualified 
diamond cutters.  Equipped with modern western 
processing lines and using the latest technologies, the 
plant can fulfill even the most complicated orders. 
The company has an agreement with Arslanian Cutting 
Works in Belgium, by which the Belgian company supplies 
the uncut diamonds and the Armenian plant returns the 
processed diamonds for distribution in European and 
international markets.  Smaller amounts of Lori\'s 
products are distributed in the United States via the 
New York-based Cora Diamond Company, which also 
supplies Lori with uncut diamonds. 
 
Shoghakn diamond-cutting plant was established in the 
village of Nor Hajn in 1971 as a state-owned 
enterprise.  In July 2000 the plant was privatized by 
Lev Levayev, a prominent Russian businessman, who owns 
a worldwide network of diamond processing companies. 
Currently Shoghakn JSC employs 1200 specialist diamond 
cutters.  It exports processed diamonds primarily to 
Israel. 
 
Arevakn LLC, owned by the Belgian company Tashe, 
operates a newly-established diamond-cutting plant 
based in Nor Hajn. 
 
--Textiles 
The Charentsavan sewing factory, which works with 
Italian companies, exports its high-quality women\'s 
undergarments to Italy and to other EU countries. 
 
--Building materials 
\"Mika-Cement\" joint-stock company owns and operates 
Hrazdan Cement Plant, one of the largest producers of 
cement in Caucasus region.  \"Mika-Cement\" is affiliated 
with Mika Limited, a large importer of oil products as 
well as the owner of a network of gasoline stations in 
Armenia.  \"Mika-Cement\" plans to upgrade its production 
lines and is looking for U.S. partners to purchase 
modern cement packaging lines under flexible payment 
terms. 
 
--Food processing 
Food processing has become a growth sector in Kotayk. 
Tamara produces a wide range of ice creams using a 
modern Italian production and packaging line.  Tamara 
is the most popular brand of ice cream in the local 
market.  The company also produces natural juices and 
packaged frozen fruit and vegetables.  Tamara exports 
its products to the United States and Russia. 
 
Geghard recently installed a new German line to produce 
high quality meat products.  (Both Geghard and Tamara 
anticipate using their own financial resources as well 
as credit lines provided by the Armenian branch of the 
London-based HSBC bank to expand.) 
 
Artashes Cannery is one of the oldest private food 
processing enterprises in Armenia.  The company 
produces juices, jams, and preserves for distribution 
in Armenia, Russia, and in the U.S. (mainly in the Los 
Angeles metropolitan area).  Artashes has increased its 
exports to the U.S. to meet a growing demand for its 
product. 
 
The French group Castel invested USD 18 million in 
Kotayk Brewery in 1997.  Castel owns 71 percent of the 
shares of the Kotayk Brewery and Mr. Gagik Tsaroukian, 
an Armenian businessman, 29 percent.  Mr. Tsaroukian is 
also the owner of Multi Group, that includes a number 
of companies mainly based in Kotayk province, 
specializing in dairy production, stone processing, 
wholesale and retail trading and wine making. 
 
\"Zohrabyani Tigran Mets\" company, based in the town of 
Yeghvard, produces high quality dairy products with 
technical and marketing assistance of the USDA 
Marketing assistance project in Armenia. 
 
Kotayk is home to several mineral water bottling 
plants.  One of these, Bjni, is a member of the SIL 
Group, a large holding company in Armenia.  \"BML-Arzni\" 
LLC, owned by several local and foreign investors, 
produces Arzni mineral water, a popular brand in the 
former Soviet Union markets.  The company\'s products 
are marketed in the Middle East and Europe. 
 
--Tourism 
Tourism is one of the province\'s most promising sectors 
for foreign investors.  The winter resort town of 
Tsakhkadzor is a popular tourist destination.  Located 
 
SIPDIS 
2,000 meters above sea level, its climate ranges from 
plus 30 degrees Celsius in summer to minus 30 degrees 
Celsius in winter with 260 days of sunshine per year on 
average.  The mountains near Tsakhkadzor host a ski 
resort.  During the Soviet era, the town attracted 
tourists and professional sportsmen from the Soviet 
Union and abroad.  The Tsakhkadzor Sports Complex was 
the main training center for the Soviet National 
Olympic team.  A number of spas and hotels in 
Tsakhkadzor are interested in cooperating with U.S. 
 
SIPDIS 
companies to help refurbish their facilities to meet 
international standards. 
 
5.  Many companies in Kotayk have growth potential. 
Most wish to cooperate or establish a partnership with 
foreign investors, and some of these offer interesting 
investment opportunities.  The Embassy encourages 
interested U.S. firms to contact the Economic- 
Commercial Section of the Embassy or the BISNIS Trade 
Specialist for Armenia Joan Morgan by phone at: (202)

INSTITUTIONALIZED EXTORTION 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Armenian National Assembly (NA) 
unanimously passed a bill on \"Citizens Who Evaded 
Compulsory Military Service\" in its second reading 
December 1.  The measure allows citizens over the age 
of 27 who evaded the draft to avoid retroactive 
criminal prosecution by paying a fine. Parliamentarians 
claim the measure is an inducement to Armenians living 
overseas to return home.  Some Armenians contend that 
the bill only formalizes a system of corruption, by 
requiring payment to avoid criminal proceedings for a 
previously unprosecuted crime.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
DRAFT LAW PASSES UNANIMOUSLY 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The Armenian National Assembly unanimously 
passed the law, \"Citizens Who Evaded Compulsory 
Military Service with Violation of the Established 
Order\" in its second reading December 1.  The bill is 
on the NA\'s agenda for its extraordinary December 
session, and should pass its third and final reading 
without amendment.  The law, strongly endorsed by both 
government and opposition lawmakers, provides an 
amnesty for male citizens over the age of 27 (or who 
have otherwise become ineligible for the draft) who 
avoided compulsory military service by paying a fee of 
100,000 drams (USD 175) for each of the semi-annual 
draft rounds they evaded.  (NOTE:  Men are required to 
serve in the military for two years when they reach the 
age of 18.  Men are excluded from the draft while 
pursuing undergraduate degrees, defending a doctoral 
thesis, or if they have two or more children.  END 
NOTE.)  Upon payment of the fine (up to USD 3,500 if 
they had been eligible for the full ten years), men 
would be enlisted in the military reserve forces and 
receive an official document from the Ministry of 
Justice indicating that they were free from criminal 
prosecution for draft evasion. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
AMNESTY MEANT TO ATTRACT ARMENIANS LIVING ABROAD 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4. (SBU) Vahagn Gevorkian, aide to the NA\'s Standing 
Committee on Defense and one of the primary drafters of 
the bill, told us that the government is currently 
seeking approximately 16,000 individuals for draft 
evasion.  Gevorkian and other supporters of the bill 
estimate that most of these men are currently abroad, 
having left the country in the 1990s in part to avoid 
military service during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
According to Gevorkian, fear of prosecution has kept 
many of these men from returning to Armenia, where the 
skills they have learned abroad could be put to good 
use.  Amnesty could both provide the government with 
added revenue and add well-trained individuals to the 
workforce. 
 
------------------------------- 
NO NEED TO SERVE IF YOU CAN PAY 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Armenians have anecdotally informed us that 
they know of numerous men, both family and friends, who 
avoided military service by bribing authorities.  No 
one knows of a single individual who has faced legal 
sanction after the age of 27 for failure to serve in 
the military.  (NOTE:  The Ministry of Justice does not 
provide information on the number of individuals it 
prosecutes for draft evasion.  END NOTE.)  Men with the 
necessary connections and financial means will pay both 
local police officials to have their names stricken 
from the list of draft evaders, and the Ministry of 
Defense to secure demobilizion documents.  Those who 
are abroad and wish to return to Armenia currently have 
to coordinate a similar process with family and friends 
so they can enter the country without hindrance. 
Armenians tell us that men can expect pay between USD 
5,000 and USD 10,000 to secure the necessary documents. 
 
------------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  TURNING BRIBES INTO REVENUE 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The law on draft evaders will regularize the 
current process by which men can pay to avoid their 
required military service.  By formally embracing the 
practice, the government raises its own revenue by 
taking control of payments that had previously been 
lining the pockets of corrupt officials.  The NA hopes 
to entice Armenians abroad to return by lowering the 
market price of the demobilization documents, and 
giving the security of a formal amnesty that could 
never be provided by the black market.

1. (C) Summary.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the 
Embassy by diplomatic note that the GOAM had agreed to the 
deployment of cargo-carrying trucks to stability operations 
in Iraq.  Foreign Minister Oskanyan confirmed to the 
Ambassador that the Ministry of Defense was in the process of 
collecting military trucks for use in Iraq.   The Ambassador 
suggested that Armenian military experts be sent to CENTCOM 
in Tampa, Florida, or that the MOD provide the Armenian 
liaison officer at CENTCOM with specific technical questions 
to speed the deployment process.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a diplomatic note 
dated December 16 to the Embassy stating that the \"Government 
of the Republic of Armenia agrees to meet the request of the 
American side( and agrees to designate an Armenia 
cargo-carrying company to participate in operation Iraqi 
Freedom II\" (NOTE:  Foreign Minister Oskanyan confirmed to 
the Ambassador that the military unit under discussion was 
the truck company as requested in ref A.  END NOTE.)  The 
diplomatic note further stated that the MFA \"suggests 
arranging a meeting between the representatives of the 
Government of the Republic of Armenia and the United States 
Embassy to discuss technical and procedural details.\" 
 
3. (C) The Ambassador met with Foreign Minister Oskanyan 
December 17 and discussed the possible deployment.  Oskanyan 
informed the Ambassador that the Ministry of Defense was in 
the process of collecting the requested units, an effort that 
\"might take time.\"  In order to speed the process, the 
Ambassador reiterated the suggestion he had made earlier to 
Defense Minister Sargsyan that the MOD dispatch specialists 
to CENTCOM in Tampa, Florida to assist in the pre-deployment 
process, or that the MOD provide the Armenian liaison officer 
already at CENTCOM with a list of technical questions 
regarding the trucks to present to CENTCOM officials. 
Oskanyan also noted that the GOAM had yet to conclude a 
Status of Forces Agreement with Kuwait, though negotiations 
were ongoing. 
 
4. (C) The Embassy had pressed the GOAM to agree to the 
deployment (refs A and B).  The Ambassador discussed the 
possible deployment with Defense Minister Sargsyan and with 
leading Armenian Diaspora members who subsequently intervened 
directly with President Kocharian and the Defense Minister.

SUBJECT: OSKANYAN-GUL MEETING RAISES HOPES OF LIMITED 
BORDER OPENING 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOHN ORDWAY FOR REASONS 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Foreign Minister Oskanyan told Ambassador 
that Turkish Foreign Minister Gul had indicated to him in a 
December 5 meeting that Turkey would open its border with 
Armenia to the two country\'s diplomatic passport holders as 
early as January 2004.  The two foreign ministers also 
discussed regional security issues and Nagorno-Karabakh.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (C) Oskanyan informed the Ambassador that he expected the 
GOT to open the Armenian-Turkish border to each country\'s 
diplomatic passport holders as early as January 2004.  During 
their December 5 meeting in Brussels, he and Foreign Minister 
Gul discussed the 15-point plan developed by the two sides 
and agreed on this first step.  Oskanyan suggested that the 
GOT might slow the process following the December 16 vote by 
the Swiss parliament\'s passing an Armenian genocide 
resolution.  He said that no agreement was in place to open 
the border to third country diplomats or tourists, but even 
the limited opening discussed by Gul would put in place the 
border crossing infrastructure required by a future broader 
opening.  Oskanyan also stated that he had suggested a 
ceremonial that he and Gul meet at the border, but had 
received a non-committal answer. 
 
3. (C) During a previous meeting, Anahit Harutunyan, the Head 
of the MFA\'s Turkey Section,  confirmed that both sides 
agreed to move forward on the list of pre-established steps 
that could lead to full normalization of relations. 
According to Harutunyan, the first agreed step is the opening 
of the border for diplomatic passport holders and third 
country nationals.  She said that Oskanyan and Gul had 
discussed the logistical requirements of such an action, and 
that Gul seemed more willing than in previous discussions to 
move ahead on this step without any other pre-conditions 
being met, such as progress in the Nagorno-Karabakh 
negotiations. 
 
4. (C) Harutunyan said that Gul raised  Nagorno-Karabakh 
within a broader discussion of regional security issues.  Gul 
said Turkey wished to become \"more decisively involved\" in 
the settlement of the dispute, but did not elaborate on what 
actions the GOT would take.

Government denied re-registration to eight parties. 
Two opposition bloc parties (including Armenia\'s 
oldest political party, the Social Hunchakian Party) 
were denied registration on technical grounds, with 
little legal recourse for appeal.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
FEWER PARTIES APPLY FOR RE-REGISTRATION 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Fifty-three parties submitted applications as 
part of new GOAM legislation requiring a one-time re- 
registration of political parties by late November 
2003.  The new legislation required the Ministry of 
Justice to examine all party charters and by-laws to 
ensure they comply with domestic legislation 
governing political organizations.  Significantly 
fewer parties applied to re-register than the 116 
parties who were previously part of the government\'s 
official roster.  The law, adopted in November 2002, 
was promoted as a means of \"sifting out\" defunct 
parties. 
 
4. (SBU) Experts attribute the notably lower number 
of applications to the recent consolidation of a 
number of minor parties.  In addition, several 
unsuccessful presidential and parliamentary 
candidates did not re-register their \"one-man\" 
parties following their electoral defeats in 2003. 
They instead joined the ranks of other parties or 
used the re-registration process as an occasion to 
publicly exit politics.  International organizations 
like the OSCE did not openly criticize the first 
stage of the re-registration process.  Parties could 
easily access guidelines for the procedure in 
nationwide newspapers and observers did not cite 
overt obstacles designed to block specific parties. 
 
------------------------------------- 
MOJ DENIES HUNCHAKS, SOCIAL DEMOCRATS 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The Ministry of Justice recently announced 
that it would deny registration to eight parties who 
had applied for re-registration.  Six of the parties 
(including the \"Armenian Royalists\") were in clear 
violation of Armenian laws forbidding parties that 
advocate non-democratic forms of government or that 
fall short of the required number of supporters. 
 
-------------------- 
ALLEGED FOREIGN TIES 
-------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Local media and opposition leaders noted 
the Ministry of Justice\'s decision to deny re- 
registration to the Hunchakian and Social Democratic 
Parties.  Both parties, who joined the opposition 
Justice Bloc in mid-2003, denounced the decision as 
a move to fragment the opposition and drive their 
supporters toward the governing coalition.  The GOAM 
responded saying the parties were not registered due 
to non-compliance with a number of regulations 
including laws forbidding parties with \"foreign\" 
sponsorship. 
 
7. (SBU) Note:  The Social Hunchakian Party was 
founded in 1887 and was especially active among 
Diaspora Armenians in the Middle East and the United 
States during the Soviet era.  The party still 
enjoys relatively high prestige within the U.S. 
Diaspora community, especially among retired 
Armenian-Americans.  Individuals close to the party 
suspect that the majority of financial support for 
the party comes from abroad.  The party split in the 
mid-90s; the GOAM did not deny the spin-off Social- 
Democratic-Hunchakian-Party its registration 
application.  End note. 
 
------------------- 
NO APPEAL POSSIBLE? 
------------------- 
 
8. (U) The new registration process does not specify 
procedures for appeal once a party\'s application is 
denied.  Social Hunchakian and Social Democratic 
Party leaders told us December 22 that they would 
take their case to court unless the National 
Assembly adopted an addendum to the registration 
procedure by the end of the year.  A special 
National Assembly session on December 25 includes 
this issue on the agenda but it is unclear to what 
extent parliamentarians support the move. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (SBU) While it remains unclear whether the 
National Assembly will address the concerns of the 
Hunchakian and Social Democratic parties, the 
registration process does not appear to have been 
overly biased against the opposition bloc. 
Representatives of the GOAM executive branch have 
been especially responsive to opposition concerns, 
spearheading the effort to amend the law.  Whether 
the National Assembly decides to create an appeals 
process for political parties will be an important 
litmus test for the legislature\'s commitment to 
democratic ideals.  End comment.

SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT PASSES THE 2004 STATE BUDGET 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
BUDGET PASSED IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE YEAR 
------------------------------------------- 
 
1.  The National Assembly passed the final 2004 State 
Budget during a December 25 extraordinary session. 
Following rigorous parliamentary lobbying that resulted 
in AMD 5.5 billion (USD 9.8 million) in additional 
spending over the initial draft, the budget passed by a 
vote of ninety-six to six (with no abstentions).  At 
the same time, the National Assembly also passed a 
package of tax law amendments that the IMF had pushed 
to combat tax evasion. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
GOVERNMENT TAKES ON PROPOSALS FROM COALITION PARTNERS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2.  Prime Minister Andranik Markarian noted that this 
budget differs from ones passed in previous years 
because it incorporates proposals both from the 
government and from the coalition partners.  (NOTE: 
Various parliamentary factions submitted an additional 
214 budgetary proposals, of which the government 
adopted 117 during the course of budget negotiations. 
END NOTE.)  According to the Minister of Finance and 
Economy Vardan Khachatrian, the additional expenditures 
will be directed mainly to social and cultural 
programs, education and health care, and social welfare 
transfers were pegged to the economy\'s growth rate. 
The Orinats Yerkir Party, parliament\'s second largest 
faction, had been critical of the initial spending 
allocations and of the changes in tax law associated 
with them.  Including the additional spending 
provisions in the final version of the budget, however, 
ultimately softened their position. 
 
------------------- 
PRELIMINARY NUMBERS 
------------------- 
 
3.  In the final version of the 2004 budget state 
expenditures are projected at AMD 317 billion (USD 564 
million), down from AMD 334.2 billion last year.  The 
budget projects revenues at AMD 274.1 billion (USD 488 
million), anticipating a 7 percent growth rate, 3 
percent annual inflation and a 16 percent increase in 
tax revenues (on top of growth), all realistic 
assumptions.  The budget thus projects a deficit of AMD 
42.9 billion (USD 7 million) or 2.5 percent of GDP, 90 
percent of which will be financed by World Bank loans 
and soft credits from foreign states. Armenia\'s total 
debt is projected at AMD 1,180 billion (USD 2 billion), 
or 69 percent of projected GDP. 
 
-------------------------- 
BUDGET LINKED TO GOAM PRSP 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  Armenian Prime Minister Andranik Markarian said 
that the 2004 budget was based on concrete strategic 
development programs, by which he is likely referring 
to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (PRSP).  As 
outlined in the strategy, the government anticipates 
greater tax revenues and plans to spend more on 
education, health care and social programs next year, 
despite an overall drop in expenditures.

1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Despite new legislation that de-criminalized 
homosexuality in Armenia, societal discrimination 
remained an obstacle for homosexuals in 2003.  Members 
of the homosexual community told Emboffs December 24 
that homosexuals continue to face intolerant attitudes 
and severe discrimination in rural areas and in the 
military.  A local human rights NGO said that cases of 
police harassment of homosexuals now involve blackmail 
and extortion more than violence.  Both noted, however, 
that the overall situation had improved and that cases 
of harassment had abated somewhat during the past year 
in Yerevan.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
INTOLERANT ATTITUDES STILL STRONG 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenia adopted a new criminal code in August 
2003 that removed Soviet-era provisions criminalizing 
homosexuality.  This move was part of the GOAM\'s 
response to pending Council of Europe membership 
obligations.  Despite this new legislation, societal 
discrimination remained the major obstacle for 
homosexuals in Armenia.  Armenians openly refer to 
homosexuals as \"immoral\" people whose behavior 
contradicts \"natural Armenian character.\"  Homosexual 
community members tell us that some politicians and 
local leaders deny that homosexuals live in Armenia. 
They insist that only Diasporan Armenians from the 
United States or Europe frequent the well-known 
homosexual nightclubs in Yerevan. 
 
4. (SBU) Members of the homosexual community told 
Emboffs December 24 that these attitudes are most 
serious in rural areas where homosexuals face ridicule 
from family and neighbors.  They said that homosexuals 
in these areas have difficultly finding steady 
employment and must conceal their sexual orientation if 
they want to participate in local government or 
business.  An open, formal homosexual community network 
does not exist in rural areas because of these 
conditions.  Some report, however, that a group of 
homosexuals plans to organize a support group in the 
northern city of Gyumri.  (Note:  Lesbian support 
groups have organized on a national level with some 
success, but maintain a relatively low profile.  These 
groups tell Embassy human rights contacts that they 
face less severe discrimination than do homosexuals but 
that intolerance for their lifestyle is still common. 
End note.) 
 
--------------------------------------- 
HARASSMENT BY POLICE/MILITARY OFFICIALS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Mikail Danielyan, Chairman of the Helsinki 
Association, reported that police officers continue to 
harass homosexuals in Armenia.  (Note:  Danielyan is 
one of the few human rights activists who sees this 
issue as part of his mandate.  End note.)  He reported 
at least three cases in which police attempted to 
blackmail men by threatening to publicly expose them as 
homosexuals to their families and friends.  Danielyan 
said that the nature of police harassment had changed 
during the past year.  Police officers now use less 
violent tactics but pressure homosexuals for 
information about homosexuals, especially married men, 
in high-ranking business or government positions from 
whom they can extort larger amounts of money. 
 
6. (SBU) Danielyan said that harassment of homosexuals 
in the military remained a significant problem.  He 
noted that homosexual recruits reportedly face physical 
and psychological abuse by officers and fellow 
soldiers.  Danielyan outlined cases in which homosexual 
soldiers were sent to psychiatric clinics for treatment 
of \"sexual perversion.\"  He said he was unaware of 
public statements by high-ranking military officials 
against homosexuals but that harsh treatment for 
homosexuals was the norm in the military. 
 
---------------------------- 
CONDITIONS BETTER IN YEREVAN 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Young men wanting an openly homosexual 
lifestyle are often forced to move to Yerevan where (as 
our contact notes) conditions for them have improved 
over the last year.  Homosexual community members said 
that police harassment in the city had diminished 
during 2003 and that they do not feel that their lives 
are in danger while in the city.  They said that 
Yerevan\'s increasingly cosmopolitan social scene now 
allows for more opportunities for expression and 
congregation.  While workplace discrimination remains a 
problem, they claimed that Yerevan offered a range of 
employment possibilities if employers or co-workers 
became hostile toward them.  One well-known member of 
Armenia\'s homosexual community told us that the 
situation in Yerevan had improved in part due to the 
new legislation but mostly because \"people are 
realizing we\'re not going away anytime soon.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) The lack of formal advocacy organizations 
complicates the already difficult situation that 
homosexuals face in Armenia.  Prominent members of the 
homosexual community say they have not yet discussed 
their lifestyle with family and friends, making them 
reluctant to organize a publicly recognized network. 
It is difficult to gauge official GOAM treatment of 
homosexuals under the law without such a group.  The 
lack of a newsletter or regular meeting continues to 
limit the ability of international organizations to 
intervene or engage the community on a formal level. 
It remains clear, however, that treatment of 
homosexuals is not yet part of the general discussion 
of human rights in Armenia.  Armenia\'s new legislation 
can only be as effective as the willingness of 
Armenians in and out of the homosexual community to 
engage in a public dialogue on the subject.

FOR SEVENTH TIME 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
2. (SBU) Armenia\'s Radio and Television National 
Commission announced December 30 that it would reject 
the bid of the A1+ media group for the last available 
television frequency.  The announcement marked the 
seventh time since 2002 (the fourth time this year) 
that the GOAM rejected a bid by the controversial but 
popular media organization.  Critics of the move called 
it a de facto ban on A1+ as retribution for critical 
reports on President Robert Kocharian\'s administration. 
The OSCE and foreign missions in Yerevan (including the 
Embassy) expressed concern over previous rejections of 
A1+ bids as detrimental to press freedom in Armenia. 
Another frequency will not become available for re- 
tendering until 2008, meaning A1+ will probably be out 
of operation for the duration of Kocharian\'s second 
term in office. 
 
3. (SBU) Radio and Television National Commission 
President Grigor Amalyan stood by the decision, citing 
problems with A1+\'s business plan as the reason for the 
rejection.  He denied allegations that the winner of 
this latest bid, Yerkir-Media, was officially linked to 
the ruling coalition member Dashnaksutiun (ARF) party. 
(Comment:  Armenian media law forbids political parties 
from owning broadcast media outlets.  Claims that the 
ARF does not control Yerkir-media are weak at best. 
The decision to grant the bid to Yerkir-Media could be 
a violation of current media law as well as another 
move against A1+.  End comment.)  President Kocharian 
made similarly unapologetic comments regarding the 
decision, claiming that opposition viewpoints already 
got considerable airtime in Armenia even without A1+.

Cooperative Best Effort 2004 in Baku, Azerbaijan agreed

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Armenia presents its compliments to the Department of 
State of the United States of America and has the honor 
to inform that the Government of Armenia has decided to 
present its candidature for the re-election to the 
United Nations Commission on Human Rights for the 
period 2005-2007 at the elections to be held during the 
organizational session of the United Nations Economic 
and Social Council in May 2004. 
The Government of the Republic of Armenia has been 
highly committed to the promotion and protection of 
human rights since the very first days of its 
independence.  Armenia joined to over 40 legal 
instruments in the field and has been consistently 
implementing a comprehensive reform package for further 
strengthening the legal and practical frameworks for 
the protection and promotion of human rights.  Armenia 
has been co-operating extensively with numerous 
international and regional organizations, including the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
the Council of Europe, in order to consolidate its 
domestic efforts, that have been duly credited by all 
of its partners from among the international community. 
This year the Armenia Parliament has adopted the Law on 
the Ombudsman and ratified the 6th Protocol of the 
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms.  These decisions once again 
certify Armenia\'s choice of a society appraising humane 
values and its firm commitment to the ideals based on 
the respect of human rights and human dignity. 
Armenia considers the issue of the promotion and 
protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
as a cornerstone for international security, stability 
and durable peace.  Armenia regards the UN Commission 
as one of key international for a for the discussion of 
human rights issues and in previous years has extended 
its support and co-sponsorship to more than 150 
resolutions adopted by the Commission.  During its 
ongoing membership term, Armenia is bringing its active 
participation to the deliberations of the Commission on 
key human rights issues.  The Government of Armenia 
believes that it can uphold its contribution to the 
work of the Commission and had therefore sought re- 
election to it. 
The Government of Armenia would highly appreciate the 
support of the United States Government to Armenia\'s 
candidature and would like to assure that if re- 
elected, Armenia will continue to do its utmost for 
further cooperation on human rights among all UN member 
states. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Armenia avails itself of this opportunity to renew to 
the Department of State of the United States of America 
assurances of its highest consideration.

jurisdiction, including functional immunity, are not 
subject, within the terms of that immunity, to Armenia 
jurisdiction, as a result of which their surrender, by any 
means, to the International Criminal Court, requires the 
express consent of the United States of America; 
 
Noting that the term \"Sending State\" has been used in

congressional committees that such country has entered into 
an agreement with the United States pursuant to Article 98 
of the Rome Statute preventing the International Criminal 
Court from proceeding against the United States personnel 
present in such country\"; 
 
Have herein agreed as follows, with the purpose both to 
restate existing obligations in this matter and to reach 
agreement contemplated in Article 98 (2) of the Rome 
Statute: 
 
Article 1. 
 
For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"person of the 
United States of America\" means the nationals of the United

official, employee (including any contractor), or member of 
the military, or any United States person who enjoys 
immunity from criminal jurisdiction under international law 
or who is subject in any manner to the jurisdiction under 
international law or who is subject in any manner to the 
jurisdiction of the Sending State (the United States of 
America). 
 
Article 2. 
 
A person of the United States of America, the Sending State, 
shall not, absent the express consent of the United States 
of America: 
 
a) be surrendered or transferred by any means to the

purpose of surrender to or transfer to the International 
Criminal Court. 
 
Article 3. 
 
When the Republic of Armenia extradites, surrenders, or 
otherwise transfers a person of the United States of America 
to a third country, the Republic of Armenia will not agree 
to the surrender or transfer of that person to the 
International Criminal Court by the third country, absent 
the express consent of the United States of America.

GOAM WHO\'S-WHO UNVEILS NEW STRATEGY 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenian Prime Minister Andranik Markarian 
unveiled the GOAM\'s first anti-corruption strategy 
Jaunary 16 during a public hearing that included an 
impressive array of ministers, legislators, 
international observers and NGOs.  A high-level 
media splash was followed by a series of technical 
\"roundtables\" on various aspects of the plan\'s 
implementation.  Well over half of Armenia\'s cabinet 
level officials attended the meeting in a display of 
GOAM support for the new plan.  Traditionally 
disparate elements of the GOAM put on a united 
public face during the meeting.  The most notable 
exception was the opposition Justice Bloc, whose 
representatives were noticeably absent.  Republican 
Party parliamentarian Vazgen Khachikyan dismissed 
their absence as \"insignificant,\" adding that 
\"everyone who matters supports this plan.\" 
 
4. (SBU) The meeting featured congratulatory 
speeches by high-level GOAM officials who touted the 
strategy as a vital part of Armenia\'s economic 
development.  Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said 
the strategy was designed to send a message of \"zero 
tolerance for corruption\" to the international 
community.  Deputy Minister of Finance and Economy 
Tigran Khachatryan said the strategy was 
inextricably linked to the GOAM\'s poverty reduction 
strategy adopted in late 2003 (reftel).  National 
Assembly Deputy Speaker Tigran Torosyan\'s remarks 
made numerous references to the \"high level of 
cooperation with the donor community\" in creating 
the strategy. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
STRONG CRITICISM FROM TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5. (U) Transparency International (TI) offered the 
strongest criticism of the document during the 
meeting, eliciting applause from local NGOs.  Local 
TI office representative Amalia Kostanyan said the 
plan failed to address corruption in the military 
and with respect to the use of environmental 
resources.  She criticized the GOAM for not fully 
engaging the donor community during every step of 
the creation of the plan and said there was an 
overall lack of political will on the part of GOAM 
officials to cooperate with outside partners on the 
problem of corruption. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) The January 16 meeting was clearly designed 
to lend the greatest possible level of legitimacy to 
the new plan despite earlier criticism on various 
technical aspects by international observers.  This 
criticism centered on the strategy\'s lack of focus 
and an overly ambitious list of \"priority areas\" 
that watered down otherwise important objectives. 
Despite comments made by GOAM officials for the 
benefit of the press, the donor community did not 
have a chance to comment on the most recent draft of 
the strategy prior to its release.  USG officials 
went on record at the most recent U.S.-Armenia Task 
Force meetings in November 2003 stating their 
disappointment at the lack of transparency during 
this last phase of the drafting process.  OSCE 
representatives commented during the January 16 
meeting that the donor community, while committed in 
principle to assisting Armenia with its anti- 
corruption efforts, would need to closely examine 
the strategy before it could commit resources for 
specific programs.

MFA ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT ISTANBUL-YEREVAN FLIGHTS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (SBU) MFA officials told us recently that weekly 
Yerevan-Istanbul flights are an important part of 
efforts to improve relations between the two 
countries.  MFA Turkey Desk Officer Anahit 
Harutunyan conveyed the MFA\'s enthusiasm about the 
popularity and commercial viability of these 
flights.  She pointed to their success as an 
indication of things to come once the Turkish- 
Armenian border is opened and other travel routes 
are established.  Harutunyan said the MFA was 
watching the newly established Tower Aviation 
flights with great interest (reftel).  She said she 
was aware of marketing obstacles Tower Aviation had 
experienced from the Armenian side while starting up 
its operations.  MFA Middle East Department Head 
Karen Mirzoyan confirmed the GOAM\'s position that 
more flights were good for the local economy and 
evolving bilateral relations and therefore had full 
MFA support. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
ARMAVIA\'S MARKETING GIVES IT AN ADVANTAGE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Despite the existence of two travel options 
to Istanbul from Armenia, Armavia Airways appears to 
maintain a strong hold on the local market through 
well-established marketing ties with travel 
agencies.  (Note:  Russian SibAir owns 70 percent of 
Armavia while a local Armenian investor owns the 
remaining 30 percent.  Armavia operates slightly 
more than half of the international flights 
departing Yerevan, followed by Aeroflot, British and 
Austrian Airlines.  End note.)  Post research 
revealed that local travel agents were aware of 
Tower Aviation\'s route to Istanbul from Yerevan but 
were more comfortable with booking tickets on 
Armavia.  Travel agents said they would be more 
willing to use Tower Aviation once it demonstrated a 
reliable track record and offered promotional 
materials and specials similar to Armavia\'s.  There 
did not appear to be overt systemic obstacles to 
purchasing a Tower Aviation ticket from Armenia. 
One travel agent reported a technical \"glitch,\" 
however, that made reservations on Tower Aviation 
more labor-intensive since Tower Aviation listed 
itself as a charter and not regular commercial 
airline. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
A SNAPSHOT OF PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE CONNECTIONS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) Customers aboard the Yerevan-Istanbul 
flights are mostly Armenian \"suitcase traders\" who 
purchase goods in Turkey for resale in Armenia 
(reftel).  An informal survey by Post of one of the 
flights in mid-December 2003 revealed that 60 
percent of travelers were textile merchants while 30 
percent operated small household electronics or 
novelty businesses.  The remaining travelers were 
executives or Turkish-Armenians visiting family in 
either country.  Only a handful of travelers were 
Turkish citizens returning from Yerevan.  The 
majority of business travelers did not speak Turkish 
but claimed it did not hamper their ability to 
operate in Turkey.  They claimed that Turkish- 
Armenian friends or relatives often serve as 
translators for Armenians during these buying trips. 
According to one Armenian traveler, anti-Armenian 
discrimination did not pose a problem while in 
Turkey \"unless conversation changes to politics or 
history.\"  \"We make better business partners than 
friends,\" he told Poloff. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) Flights between Yerevan and Istanbul 
provide the most consistent examples of successful 
Armenian-Turkish linkages at the grassroots level. 
FM Oskanian reportedly points to these flights 
during meetings with Turkish FM Gul as proof that 
open borders between the two countries will bring 
commercial success.  The MFA, while aware of 
important Armenian business interests in Armavia, 
appears more interested in increasing travel routes 
between the two countries than in protecting any 
single business interest.  Tower Aviation\'s 
obstacles in getting off the ground in Armenia 
appear more directly related to marketing problems 
than systemic pressure from the GOAM.  End comment.

SUBJECT: TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS TO ARMENIA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador.  Reasons: 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Government of Armenia, local NGOs and 
international organizations working in Armenia largely 
acknowledge that Armenia has a problem with trafficking in 
persons.  To date, Armenia has been discussed primarily as a 
country of origin and transit for trafficking victims.  A 
recent case now establishes that Armenia may also be a 
country of destination for trafficking victims.  INL staff 
met with a local NGO, which manages a trafficking victim 
assistance program in Armenia to discuss a recent case of 
trafficking in persons to Armenia for the purpose of sexual 
exploitation.  Currently, 6 victims of Uzbek citizenship are 
being provided shelter and other necessary services by the 
NGO in Armenia and the alleged traffickers are being detained 
and investigated under Article 132 of the Criminal Code, 
which criminalizes trafficking in persons.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
RECENT ARREST OF TRAFFICKERS 
 
 
2.  (C) We were informed by a local NGO, Hope and Help, which 
provides assistance to victims of trafficking under the 
auspices of a USG-funded program, that Armenian law 
enforcement officials referred 6 Uzbek nationals to Hope and 
Help for assistance in mid-January.  According to Hope and 
Help, traffickers, a woman and her two sons, were recently 
arrested under Article 132 of the Criminal Code, which 
criminalizes trafficking in persons, for their alleged role 
in organizing the trafficking of at least 8 Uzbek woman to 
Armenia for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  The alleged 
traffickers are Uzbek citizens of Armenian nationality.  They 
were arrested along with 8 presumed victims by the First 
Department of the Fourth Directorate of the National Police 
in mid-January.  The alleged victims were later released and 
6 of them were referred to Hope and Help, while an additional 
2 women were referred to a separate NGO, which manages a 
domestic violence program in Armenia. 
 
 
TRAFFICKING TO ARMENIA: A CASE STUDY 
 
 
3.  (C) During discussions with Hope and Help, we had the 
opportunity to speak briefly with 4 of the Uzbek women.  One 
woman is 18 years old, 2 are 19 years old, and the other 
women are 20, 23 and 29.  They are primarily from small towns 
in Uzbekistan and have similar family situations-- one or 
both parents are deceased; one of the women\'s husband passed 
away, leaving her alone to provide for her small 
child/children.  All of the women allegedly knew that they 
would be going to Armenia to work as elite prostitutes in 
local high-end saunas.  All of the women traveled to Armenia 
legally on their own passports.  (Note: Uzbek nationals do 
not require a visa to travel to Armenia.  End Note.) 
 
4.  (C) According to the women, they were not met at the 
airport, but took a taxi from the airport to a local hotel, 
where they were met by the trafficker, \"Angela.\" The 
trafficker took their passports from them under the guise of 
registering them with local officials and the passports were 
not returned to them.  (Note: The passports were confiscated 
by the Police at the time of the traffickers\' arrest and 
remain with the Police at the time of writing.  End Note.) 
There was no official agreement in place between the women 
and the traffickers; however, the women were told that they 
owed the traffickers USD 5,000 for the cost of travel and 
related services.  It was verbally agreed that after working 
off the $5,000 debt, the women would be free to continue 
working for themselves, but would provide 50% of earnings to 
the traffickers. They were moved to 2 apartments on Pushkin 
Street, in the center of the capital, Yerevan. 
 
5.  (C) In addition to the original $5,000 debt, the women 
were required to pay $300 each for the apartment where they 
lived (Note: They were living 4 to an apartment.  End Note.) 
and $100 each for food each month.  This sum was taken from 
their monthly \"earnings.\"  Furthermore, under the guise of 
ensuring that the women were dressed appropriately, they were 
required to procure clothing and other accessories.  The 
traffickers bought these things for them and they were 
charged exorbitant prices for them-- again the cost of the 
goods being taken from their \"earnings.\" In the same way, the 
traffickers procured articles for the apartments such as 
expensive sound systems, leather furniture, etc.  Just before 
the New Year\'s holiday, the women each received their only 
payment to date-- $100.  The women were not allowed to move 
around the city without an escort, although two of the women 
claimed to have slightly more freedom of movement. 
 
6.  (C) According to Hope and Help, clients contacted the 
traffickers directly and agreed on the location and fee.  The 
women were sent to exclusive saunas via taxi and returned the 
same way.  They were required to provide the full fee to the 
traffickers upon their return.  The women claim to have 
serviced on average 1-2 clients each day at a minimum.  One 
woman estimates her \"earnings\" to be approximately $3,500 in 
a month; a second believes she \"earned\" approximately $4,500 
in one month.  The women reported to Hope and Help that their 
clients all used condoms and treated them well.  (Comment: 
Hope and Help has arranged for gynecological exams for all of 
the women through their USG-funded assistance program.  End 
Comment.) 
 
7.  (C) Although, they do not know the identity of any of 
their clients, the women reported that they were all 
obviously wealthy men driving expensive imported vehicles. 
(Comment: GOAM officials and local NGOs have previously 
asserted that Armenia is not likely a destination country due 
to the poor economic situation; however, Hope and Help 
believes that VIP clients in Armenia would likely prefer to 
procure services of women from outside Armenia to maintain 
their anonymity.  End Comment.) 
 
 
HOW DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ARMENIA RATE? 
 
 
8.  (U) Article 132, criminalizing trafficking in persons, if 
done for mercenary purposes, was included in Armenia\'s 
Criminal Code, which was ratified in April 2003.  Since the 
Code entered into effect in August 2003, several criminal 
investigations under Article 132 have been initiated by 
Armenian law enforcement.  No cases to date have been 
prosecuted because investigations are still ongoing; however, 
a representative of the Office of the Procurator General is 
hopeful that the first case will be prosecuted in Spring 
2004.  Of these cases, Armenian law enforcement has closely 
cooperated with U.A.E. law enforcement on at least one case. 
Another case involving trafficking of women from Central 
Asia, including Uzbeks, through the Caucasus to the U.A.E. by 
an Armenian-Georgian trafficking ring highlights successful 
bilateral law enforcement cooperation between Armenia and 
Georgia.  In fall of 2003, proactive Armenia law enforcement 
intervention saved several young, mentally ill women from 
being trafficked to the U.A.E. when they were intercepted at 
the airport while attempting to depart Armenia. 
 
9.  (C) On another level, the case described herein has 
provided the Embassy with the opportunity to monitor how 
Armenian law enforcement deals with victims of trafficking in 
persons.  Two issues that Hope and Help is monitoring closely 
are the fate of the women\'s passports, which are in the 
custody of Police, and whether or not the women will be 
deported from Armenia.  The Police have not yet indicated 
what will become of the passports; however, one officer did 
assert that the women might be deported from Armenia.  Hope 
and Help maintains that the women have not violated Armenian 
immigration law, and therefore cannot legally be deported. 
Furthermore, they are concerned about the ability of the 
women to return to Uzbekistan and maintain their anonymity if 
they are officially deported from Armenia. 
 
10.  (C) Treatment of the victims at the time of arrest and 
during questioning has also been cause for concern.  Armenian 
law does not provide victims/witnesses the right to have an 
attorney or other representative present during the interview 
process.  The women have reported that there have been some 
instances of abuse and/or hostile interview tactics during 
questioning.  One of the women alleged that during the first 
interrogation she was beaten over the head 2-3 times by 
Police, at which point she lost consciousness.  The Police, 
fearing that her injuries were serious, called for Emergency 
Medical Assistance.  Hope and Help confirmed that after 
returning to the shelter from the Police that day, the victim 
was visibly shaken and had a large bruise from an injection 
administered by the responding doctor. Other assertions by 
the victims include being forced to sign victim/witness 
reports under threat and abusive language and name-calling. 
 
11.  (C) A source of frustration for the police may be a lack 
of cooperation and understanding of the situation on the part 
of some of the victims.  Hope and Help has raised the 
awareness of the victims on the trafficking phenomenon and 
their rights under Armenian law.  However, they are still 
having a hard time identifying themselves as victims and hold 
out hope that their \"belongings\" (i.e., clothing, 
electronics, furniture, etc. procured by the traffickers) 
will be returned to them.  One of the victims was 
romantically involved with one of the traffickers while still 
in Uzbekistan and \"out of love for him\" is torn about 
providing information to the Police. 
 
 
WHAT WILL BE THE FATE OF THE VICTIMS? 
 
12.  (SBU) In the past, IOM Armenia assisted in the voluntary 
repatriation of Uzbek trafficking victims in transit through 
Armenia to Uzbekistan.  IOM does not have a mission in 
Uzbekistan; therefore, IOM Kazakhstan provided assistance in 
this instance.  The return was slow and cumbersome.  Hope and 
Help is currently working with IOM to determine the 
possibility of providing return assistance to the current 
victims, if Armenian law enforcement does not deport the 
women and returns the confiscated passports.  Post will 
continue to follow developments in this case.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Prime Minister Andranik Margarian appointed 
Hranush Kharatian as Head of the Department on 
Ethnic Minorities and Religious Issues within the 
Cabinet.  Kharatian will supervise GOAM programs 
targeted at the economic and educational development 
of minority communities.  Though the influence of 
the new post is yet to be determined, Kharatian\'s 
appointment highlights a positive development in the 
GOAM\'s attitude to a long neglected issue. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
FIRST GOAM OFFICE ON ETHNIC MINORITY ISSUES 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Prime Minister Andranik Markarian appointed 
Hranush Kharatian as the Head of the Department on 
Ethnic Minorities and Religious Issues within the 
GOAM cabinet on January 19.  The appointment marks 
the first time since independence that the GOAM has 
set apart a government office for ethnic minority 
issues.  Kharatian will coordinate GOAM-funded 
programs for ethnic minority communities including 
native language elementary and secondary school 
curricula, newspapers and culture classes.  Comment: 
Past implementation of these programs has been 
spotty at best, and some point to Kharatian\'s 
appointment as a sign that the GOAM will now 
dedicate more attention to Armenia\'s ethnic 
minorities.  End comment. 
 
4. (SBU) According to government sources, 
Kharatian\'s office will not deal with the 
registration of religious organizations.  This 
function will remain with the State Registrar.  The 
Prime Minister\'s Advisor on Religious Issues will 
continue to exercise a high-level policy role with 
respect to religion in Armenia.  (Comment:  It is 
still unclear how effectively Kharatian can 
influence policy across GOAM agency lines with the 
Prime\'s Minister\'s Advisor on Religious Issues. 
Appointing additional government personnel to work 
with religious minorities appears at least a nominal 
step in the right direction.  End comment.) 
 
------------------------------ 
APPOINTMENT CAUSES CONTROVERSY 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (U) Technical aspects of Kharatian\'s appointment 
created controversy between the Prime Minister\'s 
Office and the Civil Service Council.  The Civil 
Service Council decried the Prime Minister\'s 
decision to appoint Kharatian as a violation of 
Armenian Law.  The Law on Civil Service requires 
this position to undergo a solicitation and 
transparent application process.  The Council 
suggested revoking the Prime Minister\'s decision and 
announcing competition for the position.  The 
controversy overshadowed the policy aspects of 
Kharatian\'s appointment in the press.  Both parties 
have yet to reach a mutually acceptable conclusion.

KHARATIAN:  IV ALUMNI, AZERI SPECIALIST 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Kharatian is one of Armenia\'s best-recognized 
ethnographers and authorities on Armenian ethnic 
minorities.  News media often seek her opinion on 
cultural issues surrounding the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict and the movement of refugees.  Kharatian 
participated in an International Visitors (IV) 
Program in 2001 and has participated in a number of 
Embassy-sponsored roundtable meetings on national 
minorities.  Kharatian previously worked as 
chairperson of Yerevan State University\'s Ethnology 
Department and served as vice-mayor of Yerevan in 
the late 1990\'s.  She serves as president of the 
Armenian branch of South Caucasus Women\'s Dialogue 
and is actively involved in the Armenian-Turkish

BUSH\'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: President George W. Bush\'s State of the 
Union Address was widely covered in Armenian media, 
both print and broadcast.  Coverage by broadcast media 
was mostly factual, using CNN, EuroNews or Russian 
sources.  Print media used the Russian Washington File 
provided by the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Section as 
well as other Internet sources.  The main focus of the 
coverage was on the President\'s statements on the war 
against terror, war in Iraq, situation in the Middle 
East and immigration reform.  The following is a 
summary version of print reports. END SUMMARY 
 
U.S. PRESIDENT PROMISED TO CONTINUE WAR AGAINST TERROR 
 
2. Government official Armenian language daily 
HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTIUN (01/22) published a long report 
on President Bush\'s State of the Union address on its 
international news page.  The main focus of the 
coverage was on the President\'s statements on the war 
against terrorism, policy on Iraq and situation in the 
Middle East.  In a commentary the newspaper wrote: 
\"President Bush hinted that the struggle against 
terrorists is conducted not only overseas, but also 
inside the U.S.  In this respect he called on the U.S 
Congress to renew the Patriot Act, which provides 
unprecedented wide authorities to the law enforcement 
agencies in the fight against terrorism.\" 
 
U.S. CAN ATTACK ENEMIES WITHOUT WARNING 
 
3. Centrist Armenian language daily AZG (01/22) placed 
a top article under the above headline on the 
international news page.  The article highlighted the 
President\'s statements on the war against terrorism, 
U.S. policy on Iraq, negotiations with Libya on 
eliminating weapons of mass destruction and new 
immigration reform. Commenting on the U.S. policy on 
combating terrorism, the newspaper wrote: \"Delivering 
his annual State of the Union Address to Congress, 
President Bush primarily spoke about the struggle 
against terrorism, which, in his words, will be of an 
offensive nature.  The President particularly stated 
that America grants itself the right to start a war at 
any time when the security of the nation [American] is 
threatened...  `America will never ask permission for 
protecting the security of its citizens,\' stated 
President Bush hinting at the oppositionist position of 
France, Germany, Russia and China in the war against 
Iraq.\" 
 
NEW TIMES IN THE U.S. AND OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS 
 
4. Oppositionist Armenian daily \"ARAVOT\" (01/22) 
published a long article on the second page of the 
newspaper. The main focus was on the war against 
terrorism. \"In his State of the Union Address President 
Bush openly stated: America is on the offensive in the 
struggle against terrorism.  `America will never ask 
permission for protecting its citizens,\' throwing 
obvious hints to France, Germany, Russia and China in 
the Iraqi war context, the President justified the new 
emphasis in U.S. foreign policy.  The President\'s 
annual State of the Union Address markedly differred 
from the previous ones with a special passionate 
description of things and reiteration of the U.S. role 
in the current international developments. It is easy 
to understand it - presidential elections are coming 
up, and it is not by chance that the President\'s 
statements were mainly built on the ideas of the 
security and prosperity of American citizens...  It is 
not secret that international terrorism has become a 
serious threat to not only the U.S. but to the entire 
civilized world community.  It is also indisputable 
that a similar threat to the world is a possible 
acquisition of WMDs by certain regressive, \"Asian 
mentality\" bearing countries.  Therefore, the 
international community or at least its civilized 
section should accept the new realities in the world 
and the U.S role in leading those developments.\" 
 
U.S WILL ATTACK ITS ENEMIES WITHOUT WARNING 
 
5. Pro-government Russian language newspaper NOVOYE 
VREMYA (01/22) published an article under the second 
page column \"The Theme of the Day.\"  The article draws 
parallels between President Bush\'s statements delivered 
to Congress.  \"Making a similar statement to Congress 
last year, Bush referred to the inevitable 
threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.  Later on 
such statements about the presence of these weapons in 
Iraq became a reason for going to war with Iraq. 
Since weapons of mass destruction have not been found 
so far, Bush touched upon this issue in his current 
statement very carefully. He just mentioned that a 
group of American experts have already revealed the 
existence of weapons of mass destruction programs. Now, 
justifying the war in Iraq, he said that Libya, under 
the pressure of the war in Iraq, has agreed to scrap 
its WMD programs.\"

Please protect accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) The public transportation system in Armenia 
has gradually deteriorated during the last few years 
due to both a lack of funds for the operation and 
maintenance of the fleet and the lack of government 
attention to improve the system.  Private commuter 
minibuses now form the backbone of public 
transportation, although the city administration is 
beginning to take limited measures to improve public 
transportation service in Yerevan.  End summary. 
 
-------------------- 
STATE OF THE \"FLEET\" 
-------------------- 
 
3. (U) Roughly 2,500 privately owned commuter minibuses 
(the \"marshrutkas\"), around 20 used buses donated by 
the French Government, a few trolleybuses and the one- 
line, 10-km metro make up Yerevan\'s public 
transportation.  (NOTE:  Yerevan\'s last tram line was 
shut down as of January 22.  END NOTE.)  With 
trolleybuses and trams less attractive options because 
of high electrical costs and frequent disruptions in 
the power supply buses and minivans offer the most 
reliable form of transportation.  With ticket prices 
for public transportation set well below cost, there 
are few revenue streams available to fund any upgrades 
in the system. 
 
------------------------------------ 
DEPENDENT ON IMPORTED NATURAL GAS... 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (U) The minivans and most of the buses run on 
liquified natural gas, the cheapest fuel.  Liquid gas 
is entirely imported, however, and the public 
transportation system\'s complete reliance on natural 
gas makes it extremely vulnerable to any disruption of 
the gas supply. 
 
---------------------------- 
...AND NOT ALWAYS REGISTERED 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Along with the registered minibuses servicing 
the city population there is a significant number of 
unregistered ones (which are even less likely to follow 
traffic and safety rules, frequently exacerbating 
already chaotic traffic conditions).  These privately 
owned minibuses have become the principal means of 
public transportation in Yerevan in recent years.  Many 
of the commuter minibuses are very old, in poor 
condition and rarely inspected by the traffic police. 
 
------------------------------ 
COMMENT:  A LUCRATIVE BUSINESS 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (SBU) The Yerevan city administration leases the 
rights to the minibus routes for relatively modest 
fees, mostly to hugely successful businessmen, senior 
government officials or members of the National 
Assembly.  Operating the routes is extremely lucrative: 
with almost no money going for upkeep of the vehicles, 
only a very modest sum going to the drivers and to 
lease the rights to the routes, the constantly jammed 
minibuses generate huge profits.  Although there are 
periodic efforts to regulate safety in the system, a 
cynical observer might see in those efforts more 
opportunities for police shake-downs than genuine 
improvements in the system.

EUROPE\" PRONOUNCEMENTS IN TBLISI, EU VISIT 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please treat 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Recent statements by EU officials in Tblisi 
suggesting a more concrete role for the South 
Caucasus countries in the \"Wider Europe\" initiative 
incited an unusual surge of Euro-friendly political 
posturing in Armenia.  GOAM officials and 
politicians went so far as to characterize the 
January 28-30 visit of EU Special Representative 
Heikki Talvitie as a sign of Armenia\'s \"privileged\" 
place in Brussels\' South Caucasus agenda.  Talvitie 
told us January 29 that a policy of simultaneous 
visits to all three South Caucasus countries was 
important to maintain equity and avoid accusations 
of favoritism.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
EUROPE ON EVERYONE\'S MINDS -- OR AT LEAST LIPS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (U) The EU\'s January 27 statements suggesting a 
more concrete role for the South Caucasus states in 
the \"Wider Europe\" initiative incited an 
unprecedented surge of public statements regarding 
Armenia\'s EU policy by Armenian politicians.  MFA 
officials welcomed the announcement with the 
traditional pro-Europe talking points but added 
stronger language asserting Armenia\'s position as 
forerunner for eventual EU membership.  FM Vartan 
Oskanian\'s statement following the visit of EU 
Special Representative Heikki Talvitie linked the EU 
initiative to the successful lobbying efforts by 
President Robert Kocharian during his December visit 
to Brussels.  Comment:  The unusually aggressive 
tone of the MFA statements appeared to be a face- 
saving measure after Javier Solana and EU leaders 
did not visit Yerevan while in the region for the 
inauguration of Georgian President Saakashvili.  End 
comment. 
 
4. (SBU) Even politicians not normally vocal 
regarding European integration entered the fray in 
late January.  Pro-government newspaper Golos 
Armenii, normally neutral on matters related to 
Europe, praised the statement as \"basically a 
declaration of quasi-EU-membership.\"  Opposition 
leaders took a different approach.  They used the 
opportunity to criticize the GOAM for \"sluggishness\" 
in adopting new laws and Council of Europe 
commitments.  Dashnaksutiun (ARF) newspapers carried 
editorials ranging from skeptical to mildly 
enthusiastic about Armenia\'s possible role in an 
expanded Europe.  Some ARF leaders remarked that 
GOAM efforts toward European integration must not 
\"water down\" the government\'s approach to the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict or relations with Turkey. 
ARF member and National Assembly Foreign Relations 
Committee Chair Armen Rustamian\'s comments were more 
optimistic.  He took advantage of the debate to 
credit traditional Armenian allies such as Greece 
and France with championing Armenia\'s cause as a 
potential European partner. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
EU SPECIAL REP ON WIDER EUROPE, GEORGIA 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) EU Special Representative for the South 
Caucasus Heikki Talvitie told us during a January 29 
meeting with the Ambassador that he was cautiously 
optimistic about the role of countries like Armenia 
in the Wider Europe initiative.  He said that GOAM 
leaders had been receptive to his visit and 
generally realistic about the implications of the 
\"Wider Europe\" initiative.  He commented, however, 
that maintaining a perception of parity between the 
three South Caucasus countries was more important 
than ever for his office.  Visits to the region 
henceforth would likely include stops in all three 
capitals in light of government sensitivities or 
perceived favoritism.  He credited recent events in 
Georgia with hastening the EU\'s warmer approach to 
the region.  He reported, however, that some in the 
EU were taken aback by the Georgian government\'s 
fervor when hoisting the EU flag as part of 
Saakashvili\'s inauguration ceremony.  According to 
Talvitie, while technically appropriate (given 
Georgia\'s membership in the Parliamentary Assembly 
of the Council of Europe), the use of the EU flag 
symbolized the dangers involved with runaway 
expectations regarding EU membership in the 
Caucasus.  He, like every other credible outside 
observer, believes the prospect of EU membership is 
a distant goal, at best. 
 
-------------------------------- 
COMMENT: USING THE EU AS A LEVER 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Most of our GOAM interlocutors are quite 
realistic on the prospect of EU membership.  They 
see this prospect as useful over the next few years 
as a principal driver of the economic reform agenda, 
and ensuring that Armenia retains its free market 
orientation.  In addition, they see utility in 
gradually conforming Armenia\'s reform efforts to EU 
and European standards -- a useful exercise even if 
membership is a distant, even unachievable goal. 
Given that background, it strikes us that this 
public eruption of Euro-enthusiasm could be 
counterproductive if it generates unrealistic 
expectations that cannot be achieved soon -- or 
perhaps ever. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
ECONOMICS ASIDE, A POLITICAL FLIRT WITH THE WEST 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT (continued):  The recent flurry of 
political commentary demonstrates that issue of 
closer relations with Europe has matured into a 
permanent domestic political issue in Armenia. 
While it is unclear to what extent political parties 
understand the EU accession process or the 
timeframes involved, they correctly estimate the 
issue\'s cachet with Armenians at home and abroad. 
In urging Talvitie and the EU to continue to manage 
expectations with the Armenians in order to avoid 
future misunderstandings or disappointment we should 
also urge them to point out the more intangible, 
political benefits of Armenia\'s current Euro- 
enthusiasm.  With the exception of hard-line 
skeptics who link Euro-friendly policies with 
concessions on N-K or Turkey, it appears that a pro- 
European stance will be de rigueur in Armenian 
politics for the foreseeable future.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Post convened a coordination meeting of the 
Counter-Terrorism Action Group (CTAG) in Armenia 
February 2 in advance of the capital-level CTAG meeting 
to be held February 20 per reftel.  Representatives of 
CTAG embassies present in Armenia (France, Germany, 
Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom), and 
representatives of the Government of Armenia attended 
the coordination meeting.  Each CTAG member identified 
his embassy\'s respective counter-terrorism related 
assistance, and discussed with GOAM officials potential 
areas of future cooperation.  Counter-terrorism 
assistance to Armenia, apart from U.S.- funded training 
and Export and Border Security programs and Russian 
assistance within the framework of Commonwealth of 
Independent States, remains limited.  GOAM officials 
highlighted the importance of continued training 
programs, and supported further cooperation in several 
areas, including equipment donations, increased 
intelligence sharing, assistance in preventing a 
scientific \"brain-drain\", and the strengthening of 
Armenian regulatory agencies. End summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
OVERVIEW OF G-8 ASSISTANCE 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The United States and Russia maintain the 
largest counter-terrorism (CT) assistance programs to 
Armenia.  Other CTAG states have limited their CT- 
related support to security assistance at Zvartnots 
International Airport in Yerevan, and military training 
within the NATO Partnership for Peace framework. 
Following is the current CT support provided by CTAG 
members to Armenia: 
 
France 
- France has a small program at Zvartnots International 
Airport it began in 2003 to combat the use of 
fraudulent travel documents. 
 
Germany 
- Germany has a cooperative program with Russian Border 
Guards and Armenian Passport Control (OVIR) at 
Zvartnots International Airport to combat fraudulent 
travel documents. 
 
- Germany maintains joint military cooperation programs 
with the Armenian Ministry of Defense to train the 
Armenian peace-keeping detachment.  The program has a 
limited CT-training component. 
 
Italy 
- An Italian Embassy representative reported that they 
have no current CT-related assistance programs. 
 
Russia 
- Russia has an extensive CT partnership with Armenian 
within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States (CIS).  Russia and Armenia participate in 
intelligence sharing and joint military and law 
enforcement training programs through the CIS anti- 
terrorism center. 
 
- Russian and Armenian authorities routinely hold bi- 
lateral meetings to discuss joint CT initiatives. 
 
- Russia and Armenia cooperate on border security 
initiatives.  Russian Border Guards patrol Armenia\'s 
borders with Turkey and Iran.  Armenian and Russian 
Border Guards seek increased inter-operability. 
 
- Russia donates and sells large amounts of military 
and law enforcement equipment to Armenia for CT 
efforts. 
 
United Kingdom 
- The United Kingdom has no current CT-related 
assistance programs in Armenia. 
 
United States 
- RSO reported that Armenia became a participant in the 
Bureau of Diplomatic Security\'s Anti-Terrorism 
Assistance Programs in April 2002.  Under these 
programs, the State Department has provided CT- 
training to approximately 250 Armenian law enforcement 
officials of the National Police and National Security 
Service. 
 
- The EXBS Program Advisor reported that approximately 
USD 1.3 million in CT related assistance programs in 
2004.  EXBS reported extensive cooperation with the 
Armenian National Security Service, Border Guard 
Service, Customs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
Emergency Management Service, and Nuclear Regulatory 
Agency to enhance border security and anti- 
proliferation efforts.  EXBS has coordinated large 
equipment donations, including radios, ground sensors, 
generators and vehicles, to promote these efforts 
directed primarily at points of entry into Armenia. 
EXBS hopes to expand its training programs to include 
Russian Border Guards in the coming year. 
 
- DAO reported that the United States and Armenia have 
developed increased military cooperation in the past 
two years.  The United States provides military 
assistance programs primarily focused on developing an 
Armenian peace-keeping unit.  Some military training 
has a limited CT-related component. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
GOAM IDENTIFIES AREAS FOR POTENTIAL ASSISTANCE 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4.  (SBU) GOAM representatives from the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, National Security 
Service, Border Guard Service, and National Police 
attended the coordination meeting.  The GOAM officials 
expressed gratitude for the CT assistance CTAG members 
had provided to date, and hoped for increased future 
cooperation.  Arman Israelyan, Head of the MFA\'s Global 
Security Division, outlined potential areas of future 
CT assistance to the GOAM: 
 
- Further CT training programs that support GOAM 
efforts to develop a coordinated response to terrorist 
incidents among agencies. 
 
- Provision of equipment to promote GOAM CT efforts. 
 
- Increased intelligence sharing and coordination. 
 
- Assistance in preventing a continued \'brain-drain\' of 
Armenian scientists, particularly those who worked in 
the Soviet weapons of mass destruction research and 
development sector. 
 
- Help in strengthening Armenian regulatory agencies, 
particularly those involving nuclear power and export 
control. 
 
- Assistance to GOAM bodies in developing effective CT 
legislation and implementation measures. 
 
5. (SBU) CTAG members agreed to meet in several months 
to discuss new initiatives and further plans for CT 
cooperation.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Larisa Alaverdian, Human Rights Ombudsman- 
designee, told us that she plans to create a lasting 
and strong institution that will have a respected place 
within the Armenian state structure.  A former 
International Visitor Program participant, Alaverdian 
will initially direct her efforts to harmonizing 
Armenia\'s Constitution and laws with its international 
human rights\' treaty commitments, reforming the 
judiciary, and resolving the longstanding difficulties 
between the GOAM and the Jehovah\'s Witnesses.  End 
Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
ARMENIA\'S FIRST HUMAN RIGHTS OMBUDSMAN 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Larissa Alaverdian confirmed recent press 
speculation that the President\'s Office has informed 
her that she will be appointed Armenia\'s first Human 
Rights Ombudsman.  The National Assembly created the 
post of Ombudsman during the Fall 2003 parliamentary 
session.  Under existing Armenian law, the President 
can appoint the Ombudsman as an official of the 
executive branch.  The appointment is subject to 
consultations with parliamentary factions.  (Note: The 
Constitution does not require the President to seek 
parliamentary confirmation for executive appointments, 
only present the appointee\'s name for discussion.  End 
Note.)  Alaverdian says she is currently awaiting the 
response from parliamentary leaders on her pending 
appointment. 
 
----------------------------- 
MAKING AN EFFECTIVE OMBUDSMAN 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Alaverdian, who participated in a December 
2003 International Visitors Program in the United 
States, told us that her most important priority would 
be creating a lasting and independent office with a 
respected place in the Armenian government.  She said 
that she fears that the Office of the Ombudsman will be 
a weak institution, lacking a mandate and real 
authority.  Alaverdian told us that as Ombudsman she 
would fight to get an independent budget and clearly 
defined duties.  She plans to inform GOAM agencies, 
including law enforcement authorities, the Ministry of 
Justice, and the security services, about her agenda 
and their obligations under domestic and international 
law regarding the protection of human rights. 
Alaverdian plans to establish field offices that would 
extend her efforts into the regions. 
 
----------------------- 
LIMITED GOALS AT OUTSET 
----------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Alaverdian addressed three areas in which 
plans to concentrate her efforts: 
 
- She will review Armenia\'s human rights obligations 
under international law, and encourage the National 
Assembly to harmonize domestic legal codes with these 
requirements. 
 
- She proposes a judicial reform initiative that would 
include monitoring the courts and a program to educate 
judges on citizen\'s rights. 
 
- Alaverdian, with the help of National Assembly member 
Hranush Hakobian, hopes to resolve the difficulties of 
the Jehovah\'s Witnesses\' in registering as a religious 
organization. 
 
She also hopes to begin investigations on a backlog of 
human rights complaints registered with the President\'s 
Human Rights Commission. 
 
------------------------- 
COMMENT: TOUGH ROAD AHEAD 
------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) We consider the President\'s appointment of 
Alaverdian to be an excellent choice and one that could 
lead to positive developments in Armenia\'s human rights 
record.  Alaverdian is well-known to the Embassy, 
participating in a recent International Visitors 
Program and receiving a Democracy Commission Small 
Grant for a program to raise youth awareness of their 
civil liberties.  She has earned the reputation of a 
dedicated but pragmatic defender of human rights, using 
her political connections and knowledge of the 
bureaucracy to work within the system to effect change. 
 
7. (SBU) Despite her dedication and qualifications, 
Alaverdian faces a difficult task in establishing an 
independent and effective institution.  The Ombudsman 
lacks a clearly defined mandate, and as an executive 
organ, lacks independence from the authorities and 
institutions most in need of reform.  Alaverdian told 
us that she is \"ready to change things,\" but to be 
successful she must also be ready to challenge the 
authorities and forcefully assert her agenda and 
prerogatives.  Her track record suggests she is one of 
the best qualified persons in Armenia for this task. 
End Comment.

Human Trafficking (TIP Commission), to discuss concerns 
that the GOAM has been slow to take visible, concrete 
steps to combat trafficking in persons in recent

promotion of the head of the TIP Commission to another 
agency, the Commission\'s activities decreased 
considerably and that slow deliberation over the GOAM\'s 
ratification of the National Plan of Action (NPA) 
impeded implementation of key goals.  Margarian 
admitted that progress on TIP might have been slow, but 
emphasized that there have been positive developments. 
He noted that the issue of trafficking in persons is a 
sensitive one, crossing many sectors, and has no 
unequivocal solutions.  However, he agreed that now 
that the NPA has been ratified, the GOAM must put 
greater emphasis on implementation. 
 
3.  (SBU) Margarian was presented with the Department\'s 
country strategy, brief project descriptions of USG- 
funded counter-trafficking initiatives, and questions 
provided as guidance in preparation of the annual TIP 
report.  He immediately called one of his staff in our 
presence to discuss our request for information in 
preparation of this year\'s TIP report and confirmed 
that we could expect answers to our inquiries by 10 
February.  This will allow us to work with the TIP 
Commission to identify gaps in key areas that might be 
addressed in the near term. (NOTE.  The TIP Commission 
met later that day.  An informal readout of that 
meeting by one of the members indicates that Embassy\'s 
concerns were discussed at length.  The Procurator 
General\'s Office made an appeal to the Commission 
members to provide complete and honest information on 
the work that has been done, especially in the area of 
law enforcement efforts.  END NOTE.) 
 
4.  (SBU) The recent case involving Uzbek women 
trafficked to Armenia for sexual exploitation, which 
Margarian was unaware of, was discussed at length. 
Although indications that Armenia may be a destination 
country for trafficking victims is a concern, we are 
very encouraged by law enforcement\'s proactive role in 
arresting alleged traffickers and opening a criminal 
investigation.  Moreover, we are very pleased that law 
enforcement swiftly identified the trafficking victims 
among the arrested and referred them to a local NGO 
providing trafficking victim assistance under the 
auspices of an USG-funded program.  (NOTE: The case 
comes on the heels of OSCE-IOM-U.S. Embassy co- 
sponsored training on victim identification and NGO 
referral mechanisms.  END NOTE) 
 
5.  (SBU) DCM took the opportunity to bring up concerns 
about police handling of some aspects of the case and 
emphasized the need to ensure victims\' anonymity and 
engage them with respect and compassion.  Margarian 
agreed that there is room for improvement in law 
enforcement\'s interaction with trafficking victims, but 
attributed any shortcomings primarily to over 
zealousness.  (COMMENT: Embassy has had discussions 
with various interlocutors on the specifics of this 
case, all of which indicate that over zealousness is 
likely the root cause behind shortcomings in the 
treatment of victims.  Most interlocutors agree that 
given the positive steps forward by law enforcement on 
this issue, international organizations and local NGOs 
should continue to engage law enforcement in a 
proactive way, rather than alienating them with harsh 
criticism.  END COMMENT.) 
 
6.  (U) Lastly, DCM raised the issue of bilateral law 
enforcement cooperation with key origin, destination 
and transit countries, especially the U.A.E. and 
Uzbekistan.  Margarian indicated that there are no 
current bilateral agreements with Uzbekistan, although 
law enforcement reports that a letter of request has 
been sent to their counterparts in Uzbekistan on the 
current trafficking investigation.  A bilateral treaty 
is in place between Armenia and the U.A.E.; however, 
there are no specific provisions regarding trafficking 
in persons.  This is an issue that the Embassy will 
continue to follow closely in Armenia. 
 
7.  (SBU) COMMENT: Perhaps the single most important 
point emphasized during the meeting with Deputy Foreign 
Minister Margarian is the need for the GOAM to \"take 
ownership\" of efforts to combat and prevent trafficking 
in persons in Armenia.  Despite the GOAM\'s willingness 
to participate in various events developed by local 
NGOs and international organizations, the perception 
both in Armenia and abroad is that the GOAM is not 
taking its own initiatives.  This is an important 
nuance that has been lost on many key GOAM officials to 
date.  Overall, the Embassy believes the meeting was 
well received and has helped to reinvigorate GOAM\'s 
attention to this critical issue.  END COMMENT.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Dashnak Party Chairman Hrand Margarayan\'s 
February 6 comments on relations with Turkey, N-K, 
and Georgia\'s Armenian population sparked renewed 
controversy among Armenia\'s political elite. 
Margaryan declared during his address to the 
Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF or 
\"Dashnaksutyun\") 29th World Congress that the GOAM 
should not entertain closer relations with Turkey, 
endorsed permanent independent status for all 
geographic regions involved in the N-K conflict and 
called for autonomy for the Armenian enclaves in 
Georgia\'s Javakheti region.  FM Vartan Oskanian, who 
himself addressed the meeting before Margaryan\'s 
speech, was quick to distance himself and the GOAM 
from these statements during press opportunities 
this week.  Margaryan\'s comments appeared carefully 
calibrated for the Diasporan audience that is still 
a significant support base for the ARF.  The extent 
to which local ARF politicians are willing to adopt 
Margaryan\'s speech as a party mantra will affect the 
ARF\'s privileged place in the governing coalition. 
While it is still too early to separate last week\'s 
hype from long-term effects on party policies, the 
ARF congress hurled the party back into the domestic 
spotlight.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
SPEECH MAKES HEADLINES FOR ARF 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) ARF Chairman Hrand Margaryan opened the 
party\'s 29th World Congress February 6 with a 
controversial speech that has sparked debate among 
Armenia\'s political elite.  Margaryan declared 
during the speech that the GOAM should halt 
discussions of rapprochement with Turkey until the 
GOT met all ARF pre-conditions.  He called any 
proposal for border opening \"irrelevant\" until the 
GOT classified the events of 1912-15 as genocide. 
Margaryan accused the Turkish-Armenian 
Reconciliation Commission of \"treachery\" against 
Armenia and criticized its \"secret funding by world 
powers.\" 
 
4. (SBU) Margaryan reiterated the ARF\'s 
traditionally harsh stand regarding Nagorno- 
Karabagh.  He told the audience categorically that 
no land involved in the N-K conflict should ever be 
returned to Azerbaijan.  He suggested expanding the 
current areas controlled by Armenian forces to 
include other regions historically inhabited by 
Armenians (referring to Shahumian and Getashen). 
These comments incited waves of enthusiastic 
applause from the audience and wincing from GOAM 
representatives seated behind him on the stand. 
 
5. (SBU) The most unexpected part of Margaryan\'s 
speech was a call for autonomy for Armenians living 
in Georgia\'s Javakheti region.  He declared that 
Javakh was \"now a part of the Armenian agenda\" and 
accused successive Georgian regimes of 
discrimination and exploitation of the country\'s 
Armenian population.  He fell short of calling for 
an independent state and clarified that an 
autonomous Armenian region should exist within the 
Georgian state.  Margaryan claimed that the Armenian 
Diaspora was increasingly supportive of the ARF\'s 
approach to Javakheti. 
 
------------------------------------- 
SPEECH CREATES HEADACHES FOR THE GOAM 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) FM Vartan Oskanian, who himself addressed 
the meeting before Margaryan\'s speech, was quick to 
distance himself and the GOAM from these statements 
during press opportunities this week.  Oskanian did 
not criticize Margaryan\'s comments, but went to 
great lengths to categorize them as ARF opinions 
that \"do not reflect Government of Armenia policy.\" 
MFA spokesman Hamlet Gasparian responded 
aggressively to the speech by reciting 
constitutional passages giving the president 
authority to create foreign policy.  Local news 
outlets carried his closing statement that, 
\"[Foreign Policy] issues are a constitutional 
prerogative of the President,\" not of the Dashnaks. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
MEETING ATTRACTS DIASPORA, LOCAL POWER PLAYERS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. (U) The ARF Congress was a standing-room only 
event that included an impressive selection of high- 
level GOAM representatives.  The Prime Minister, a 
majority of cabinet-level ministers and 
parliamentarians from the whole range of Armenia\'s 
political spectrum attended the meeting.  Most 
speeches from GOAM representatives made 
congratulatory remarks about the ARF\'s place among 
the GOAM governing coalition and the party\'s current 
role as a cooperative political player.  The event 
attracted a large number of Diasporans who support 
ARF and was the largest public event for the party 
since its reemergence in 1998.  An ARF 
parliamentarian told us that the most enthusiastic 
support for the event came from Diasporan ARF 
chapters in France and Russia. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) Margaryan\'s comments appeared carefully 
calibrated for the Diasporan audience that is still 
a significant support base for the ARF.  The extent 
to which local ARF politicians are willing to adopt 
Margaryan\'s speech as a party mantra will no doubt 
affect the ARF\'s privileged place in the governing 
coalition.  Some are quick to forecast the 
controversy surrounding the speech as one of the 
first fissures before the coalition\'s possible 
breakdown.  While it is still too soon to determine 
how much of last week\'s hype has real resonance 
within ARF party leaders and policy, Margaryan\'s 
comments and the ARF\'s splashy World Congress has 
definitely hurled the party back into the domestic 
spotlight -- for now.

SUBJECT: ARMENIA: DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH 
 
 
--------- 
SUMMARY 
--------- 
 
1.  Armenia\'s 2003 economic performance exceeded all 
predictions; despite the rounds of elections and 
political tremors during the year, the real Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 13.9 percent, a record 
high since 1991 independence.  Construction (mostly 
donor financed) and industry contributed to the growth 
by about 6 and 4.5 percentage points respectively.  The 
external sector expanded by more than 30 percent, with 
exports growing faster than imports.  The economy 
posted positive trends in labor and financial markets 
as well.  The major price indices, however, show sharp 
increases:  the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew by 8.6 
percent, while the Producer Price Index (PPI) jumped by 
21.1 percent, the highest annual inflation rate since 
1998.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW: CONSTRUCTION DRIVES GROWTH 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
2.  Although the annualized economic growth rate 
declined by the end of December compared to November, 
the annual growth rate finished the year at 13.9 
percent, the highest since independence.  The growth 
pattern, however, was volatile in the first half of 
2003, fluctuating from 7.5 percent in February to 14.9 
percent in June.  In the second half of 2003 the growth 
rate was relatively stable hovering around 15 percent. 
3.  As in 2002, industry and construction continue to 
drive growth.  Year-on-year construction growth was 
roughly 40 percent from January to December 2003 (with 
residential construction growing by nearly 80 percent). 
Diaspora-based Lincy Foundation financing supported 
most of the growth in construction.  Private 
construction almost doubled, however, responding to 
demand and sustained price increases in the real estate 
market.  (Note:  Construction as a share of GDP is 
estimated at 14.4 percent.  End Note.) 
4.  Production of industrial goods increased by 14.9 
percent with the level of electricity production was 
unchanged.  Within the manufacturing sector, tobacco 
output was up 37 percent in volume terms, rubber and 
plastic by 125 percent, metal processing by 46 percent 
and machinery by almost 26 percent.  These high rates 
are partly attributable to a depressed base-period, but 
also reflect considerable new investment in these 
sectors.  Industry has by far the largest share of GDP, 
24.1 percent.  Agriculture, constituting about 21 
percent of GDP, grew at 4.3 percent, despite 
pessimistic forecasts due to an unusually cold winter 
in 2002-2003.   Retail trade and services also grew 
strongly (about 13 percent), indicating a consolidation 
of domestic demand. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
INFLATION: BREAD PRICES HIT THE CONSUMER BASKET 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
5.  Monthly price trends followed seasonal patterns in 
deflationary summer.  In September, however, when the 
trend is also usually deflationary, prices rose by 2.5 
percent, owing to a sharp jump in prices for bread and 
related products.  This brought year-on-year inflation 
in September to more than 7 percent.  Although in 
September international financial institutions as well 
as the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) gave various 
forecasts of up to 7 percent inflation for the year, 
inflation for the rest of the year continued its trend 
with the highest monthly price increase of 5.3 percent 
in December.  That brought the annual cumulative 
inflation to 8.6 percent, the highest since 1998. 
6.  An estimated 5 percentage points of the inflation 
is explained by an increase in wheat prices in Russia, 
the main trade partner in this category.  Wheat 
products represent nearly 20 percent of the CPI basket, 
and aggregate prices for this group increased by more 
than 25 percent in 2003.  In early September the 
governor of the CBA, Tigran Sarkissian, said that there 
was no need to adjust monetary policy for 2003, 
implying only \"moderate\" growth in the money supply to 
neutralize inflationary pressures.  He referred to the 
price increase as a \"temporary external shock,\" without 
which the CPI would be in line with the targeted level 
of 3 percent.  (Note:  According to the Monetary Policy 
Program, the CBA forecasts 7 percent inflation in 2004, 
mostly due to anticipated increases in gas and water 
tariffs.  End Note.) 
7.  The GDP deflator, the indicator of price changes on 
all products, increased in December by 0.2 percentage 
points, bringing annualized growth in the deflator for 
January-December to 4.7 percent, the highest since 
1998.  The Producer Price Index, an indicator of cost- 
driven inflation, also trended upward by the end of the 
year, increasing by 21.1 percent, the highest level 
since 1998. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
EMPLOYMENT: NUMBERS MIXED, BUT GENERALLY HIGHER 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
8.  According to the National Statistics Services 
(NSS), 10.1 percent of the active population, or 124.8 
thousand people, is currently unemployed, compared to 
9.4 percent in 2002.  Although this may appear 
paradoxical in a period of high growth, the NSS finally 
incorporated the 2001 Census results into the 
unemployment calculus, according to which the 
denominator used, active population, decreased from 
about 1.4 million in 2002 calculations to 1.24 million 
in 2003.  Applying the new numbers back to the 2002 
estimate, the unemployment rate would come to 10.8 
percent.  Thus, over the course of 2003, real 
unemployment decreased by 0.7 percent.  (Note: Official 
unemployment counts only those who receive unemployment 
insurance, not all those who are looking for jobs.  End 
Note.) 
 
------------------------------------------ 
EXTERNAL SECTOR: RUSSIA LOSES MARKET SHARE 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9.  Armenia\'s trade turnover expanded rapidly in year- 
on-year terms, with growth driven mainly by a 
substantial increase in trade in precious stones and 
metals.  According to official data, export revenue was 
up by 34.2 percent at USD 678.1 million, well above the 
USD 590 million projected by the CBA.  Import 
expenditures grew at about 28.6 percent to USD 1.3 
billion.  Precious metals and stones continue to 
dominate Armenia\'s trade structure:  about 52 percent 
of export growth and 41 percent of import growth is 
attributed to precious stones and metals.  The sector 
has benefited from stable supplies of stones from its 
main sources:  Israel, Belgium and Russia. 
 
10.  Russia, although it remains Armenia\'s largest 
trade partner, lost market share for the second year in 
a row.  Russia\'s total trade share decreased from 19.2 
percent in 2001 to 17.3 in 2002 and 15.5 (or USD 302.3 
million) in 2003.  Imports from Russia, although they 
increased in dollar terms, decreased as a share of 
total imports from 19.5 percent in 2002 to 16.4 percent 
(or USD 207.7 million) in 2003.  Israel became the 
largest export partner for Armenia, with total exports 
of USD 142.3 million, up by about 84 percent.  Belgium 
and the USA remain the third and fourth trade partners 
in terms of exports. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
FINANCIAL SECTOR: DECREASING INTEREST RATES AND STABLE 
ARMENIAN DRAM (AMD) HERALD LOWER COUNTRY RISK 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
11.  During 2003, the CBA twice revised its refinancing 
rate, eventually cutting it from 13.5 percent to 9 
percent in August.  The policy was designed to 
stimulate the demand for money in the economy, 
increasing money supply (M2) by 28 percent.  (Note: 
This provided yet another reason for increased 
inflation.  End Note.)  In 2003 most interest rates 
declined, including deposit and money market rates. 
Nevertheless, high credit risks and the poor quality of 
financial management between banks and enterprises kept 
lending rates high, thus increasing profits in the 
banking sector. 
 
12.  The Armenian national currency, the Dram (AMD), 
fluctuated within a narrow band against the USD during 
the year.  In August a nominal depreciation of 4.2 
percent year-on-year was recorded, partly reflecting 
inflationary expectations.  By the end of September, 
however, the rate stood at AMD 570/USD 1, an 
appreciation of almost 2 percent, mostly due to USD 
inflow to the country via transfers and tourist 
spending.  (Note:  According to the NSS, the number of 
tourists in 2003 increased by about 27 percent to 
205,000.  End Note.)  The AMD lost value during the 
usual Christmas and New Year shopping frenzy, sliding 
back to normal rates immediately after the holidays.

SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Armenian press noted that trade turnover 
for the first nine months of 2003 between Armenia and 
Russia increased 84 percent over 2002 levels of the 
same period and was distributed almost equally among 
Armenian exports to Russia and Russian exports to 
Armenia.  Despite this statistical increase, actual 
trade remains at a near constant level and 
transportation through Georgia as well as a small 
domestic Armenian market remain the major obstacles for 
a substantial long-term increase of trade between 
Armenia and Russia.  Although trade turnover between 
Armenia and Russia increased, in 2003 Russia lost 
market share relative to Armenia\'s other major trading 
partners.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
RUSSIAN EXPORTS TO ARMENIA 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Official statistics from the GOAM showed that 
the total value of imports from Russia to Armenia 
during January to September of 2003 was USD 165 
million, an increase from USD 118 million during the 
same period in 2002, placing Russia as the number one 
exporter to Armenia, with twice the turnover of second 
place Belgium.  Of the USD 47 million increase, USD 37 
million was in the import of diamonds.  (Note: 
Diamonds were also a significant component of trade 
with Belgium.  End Note.)  Despite growth in Russia\'s 
trade turnover with Armenia, Russia lost market share 
for the second year in a row:  Russia\'s total trade 
turnover share decreased from 19.2 percent in 2001 to 
17.3 percent in 2002 and to 15.5 percent in 2003. 
 
4. (SBU) Russian diplomat Aleksandr Zyganov told us 
that the biggest imports to Armenia from Russia were 
oil, gas, nuclear fuel and diamonds.  He stated that 
Russia was Armenia\'s number one trading partner and the 
trade had increased every year for the past three 
years. He gave an example of a successful Russian- 
Armenian joint venture, Armenia Lada, which sells 
approximately 400 Russian made vehicles a month in 
Armenia.  Other Russian exports to Armenia were wheat, 
sugar, chemical products and vodka. Despite the 
statistical increase Zyganov admitted that the small 
domestic market in Armenia inhibited trade and large- 
scale Russian investment. 
 
5. (SBU) According to Tigran Davtyan, the Deputy 
Minister of Trade and Economy, the main increase in 
Armenian imports for 2003 from Russia was in diamonds; 
he believed the other main exports, oil, gas, and 
nuclear fuel were about at the same level as 2002. 
Davtyan felt that the overall statistical 40 percent 
increase in imports from Russia was misleading as most 
of the imported diamonds were refinished and re- 
exported to Belgium and Israel or back to Russia for 
final sale.  Nerses Mkrtchyan, Head of the 
International Economic Cooperation Department, believed 
that the increase in diamond imports could be traced 
back to one Russian-based Armenian businessmen, Ara 
Abrahamyan.  The reason for this spike was unclear to 
Mkrtchyan; he believed it could have easily been an 
anomaly and did not represent an overall strategy of 
increasing trade between Russia and Armenia. 
 
6. (SBU) Mrktchyan, as well as Gagik Hairapetian, the 
Russian desk officer at the Armenian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, felt that while refined oil was a 
major Russian import, the country of origin of oil 
imports at the Georgian port of Poti was not always 
clear.  Management of MIKA, a gas station franchise 
that owns roughly 50 percent of the Armenian domestic 
market, told Hairapetian that up to half of the fuel 
sold by MIKA comes from either Romania or Turkey. 
 
-------------------------- 
ARMENIAN EXPORTS TO RUSSIA 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Official GOAM statistics show that from 
January to September of 2003, Armenian exports to 
Russia equaled USD 64 million, as compared to USD 46 
million.  Of the USD 18 million increase, USD 6 million 
was refinished diamonds.  Zyganov said that Armenian 
exports consisted of cognac, vegetables, fruits, 
cheese, tobacco, metals, light machinery, chemicals, 
and even Armenian beer.  Hairapetian stated that since 
many Armenian farmers do not have money for 
fertilizers, there was also a demand for their 
environmentally friendly food products in Russia.  The 
USDA has encouraged this trend by helping found the 
Armenian Organic Agriculture Foundation (AOAF) as well 
as offering a USDA-Extension mini-grant program that 
encourages an organic component for crop production as 
well as livestock.  Hairapetian stated that a soon-to- 
be-opened Armenian consulate in Southern Russia, 
coupled with good cooperation with local Russian 
officials, a large Armenian Diaspora, and cheaper costs 
of transporting goods to southern Russia than to the 
Moscow region, all contributed to higher import demand. 
Hairapetian and Mkrtchyan both felt the expanding 
Russian economy would always be an outlet for Armenian 
goods. 
 
------------------------- 
COGNAC: NUMBER ONE EXPORT 
------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) The Sales Manger of the Yerevan Brandy Company 
(YBC), Serge Der-Sahaggian told us that 80 percent of 
their export market was in Russia.  In 2003 they 
exported approximately 6.4 million bottles, or tens of 
millions of dollars worth of brandy, which made cognac 
the leading export item to Russia.  Der-Sahaggian 
stated that the YBC and its competition, Great Valley, 
constitute about 90 percent of the Armenian export 
brandy market in Russia.  The YBC shipped all their 
products through the Georgian port city of Poti, and 
despite the uncertain political climate in Georgia, the 
YBC had no plans to curtail exports.  Der-Sahaggian and 
Haripetian were optimistic that tariffs and duties and 
corrupt practices would finally be lowered and/or 
minimized under a new reform-minded Georgian 
government. 
 
----------------------------- 
OBSTACLES TO INCREASED TRADE 
---------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Der-Sahaggian, Zyganov, Hairapetian and 
Mkrtchyan all agreed that high tariffs, corruption, 
encounters with Georgian criminal groups and the 
uncertainty of goods transiting unmolested through 
Georgian customs all combined to make exporting goods 
from Armenia to Russia through Georgia a substantial 
obstacle to increased trade with Russia. Hairapetian 
and Zyganov both strongly believed that a railroad link 
through the breakaway republic of Abkhazia could boost 
trade between the nations significantly.  Zyganov 
believed that Armenian cement and construction 
materials could be sold in Russia as well as an 
increase in exporting fruit, vegetables, foodstuffs, 
and cheese.  Russia could also export more wheat, sugar 
and oil.  All agreed that politically this rail link 
was unlikely to be opened anytime soon. Zyganov stated 
that in March of 2003, Russian President Putin and 
former Georgian President Shevardnadze had agreed to 
build a new railway through Georgia to link Russia and 
Armenia, but this was still in the discussion stage.

10. (SBU) While Russia is clearly Armenia\'s most 
significant trading partner, any hope for significant 
growth in real trade will depend on improving 
transportation links between the two countries, a 
prospect unlikely in the near future.

SUBJECT: KOCHARIAN\'S INNER CIRCLE:  ACCESS BUT LIMITED 
INFLUENCE 
 
REF: 03 YEREVAN 2975 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John Ordway for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (c) President Kocharian has a small inner circle with 
direct access to him and the potential to influence his 
thinking on foreign policy matters.  Within this inner circle 
are Foreign Minister Oskanian, Minister of Defense Sargsian, 
Head of State TV Harutyunian, Presidential Chief of Staff 
Tumanyan, and First Assistant to the President Gevorkian. 
While these advisors all have essentially unfettered access 
to the President, it is doubtful that any of them is in a 
position to influence his decisions:  on the contrary, their 
positions either coincide with his or are derived from his. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
GEVORGIAN:  NOT QUITE AN EMINENCE GRISE? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (c) Armen Gevorgian (born in Yerevan in 1973), First 
Assistant to the President, is essentially always at 
Kocharian\'s side.  While his access is unparalleled and some 
in Yerevan refer to him as an \"eminence grise,\" he does not 
appear to influence the President so much as serve as a foil 
for him.  Intensely loyal, Gevorgian joined Kocharian\'s 
office in 1997, while Kocharian was still Prime Minister, and 
moved with him to the President\'s office.  From 1990-1997 
Gevorgian studied at St. Petersburg\'s Institute of Public 
Administration, and holds a Ph.D. in Pedagogy.  He recently 
married a medical student, and speaks excellent Russian as 
well as some English. 
 
-------------------------------- 
SARGSIAN:  A FINGER IN EVERY PIE 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (c) Minister of Defense Serzh Sargsian, long-time 
confidant and Presidential ally, has close economic ties with 
many of President Kocharian\'s interests (reftel).  Born in 
1954 in Stepanakert, Sargsian shares with Kocharian and his 
closest confidants the deep conviction that N-K must be 
protected at all costs.  His ties to the military are crucial 
to Kocharian\'s power base, and his and the President\'s 
beliefs are most likely to coincide. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
HARUTYUNIAN:  KEEPING INFORMATION ON TRACK 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (c) Head of State TV (and former Presidential Chief of 
Staff) Aleksan Harutyunian is an intensely loyal, long-time 
friend of Kocharian.  Born in 1965 in Karabakh, his family 
moved to Yerevan in the early 1970s.  Active in Armenia\'s 
independence movement, Harutyunian briefly worked in the 
Presidential Administration in 1992 before being assigned to 
the Armenian Embassy in Paris.  Harutyunian took a position 
as Karabakh Permanent Representative in Armenia in 1995 
before joining Kocharian\'s staff in 1997, and served as Chief 
of Staff 1998-2000.  In early 2000 Harutyunian was detained 
for several months in connection with the October 27, 1999 
parliamentary shootings, and allegedly tortured in jail. 
Harutyunian was appointed head of Armenian State TV in 
January of 2003, following the December 29, 2002 
assassination of the previous holder of that position, Tigran 
Naghdalian. 
 
---------------------------------- 
TUMANYAN:  AN EFFECTIVE GATEKEEPER 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (c) Presidential Chief of Staff Artashes Tumanyan, born in 
1949, has been active in Armenian politics since 1990.  A 
former deputy speaker of parliament, 1992-1995, Tumanyan 
headed the Armenian tax inspectorate from 1997-1999. 
Although Tumanyan is seen as a close friend of Kocharian, and 
can limit other people\'s access, he doesn\'t exert a great 
deal of influence of his own.  Most recently he has been 
Kocharian\'s principal interlocutor on matters dealing with 
the Lincy Foundation and its extensive infrastructure 
projects in Armenia.  Although he does not have as high a 
public profile as Serzh Sargsian, he is nonetheless widely 
known to the public.  The Ambassador spent a day in October 
2003 travelling with Tumanyan to visit a number of 
Lincy-funded projects.  Tumanyan, who was driving, made 
occasional stops to speak to villagers--all of whom 
immediately recognized him and proceeded to engage him on 
local concerns. 
------------------------------ 
OSKANIAN:  TOES THE PARTY LINE 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (c) Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian, although he appears 
to have limited influence on the President\'s thinking, at 
least can generally be counted on to accurately relay both 
the content and tone of foreign governments\' messages.  A 
former Tufts professor and former U.S. citizen, Oskanian is a 
savvy interlocutor, with good access to the President, but 
with only limited influence.  Oskanian is fully capable of 
thinking \"outside the box,\" but cannot always deliver the 
President when it comes time for a decision.  Oskanian, 
however, has been given more running room on improving 
relations with Turkey--despite the fact that Kocharian when 
speaking to us on the subject is decidedly more pessimistic. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (c) While all of these men have immediate and liberal 
access to the President, as the President\'s Special Advisor 
for Economics Nercissiantz told us recently, \"Kocharian 
doesn\'t listen to anyone.\"  Nercissiantz noted that he has 
found giving Kocharian, an avid reader, thought-provoking 
English-language books to read is the best way to open the 
President\'s mind to new ways of viewing a particular issue.

SUBJECT:  CRACKS IN THE COALITION: DASHNAKS ATTACK THE 
GOAM IN AN ANTI-CORRUPTION FRENZY 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but Unclassified.  Protect 
Accordingly. 
 
-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenia\'s governing coalition, an alliance of 
the Republican Party, Armenian Revolutionary Federation 
(ARF, or Dashnaks), and Orinats Yerkir (Country of 
Law), that holds the majority of seats in the National 
Assembly (NA), has shown signs of cracking on the anti- 
corruption issue.  During a January 19 Council of 
Europe (COE) seminar, Vahan Hovhannissian, a prominent 
ARF figure and the Deputy Chairman of the NA, harshly 
criticized the GOAM, the NA, Court and Judicial systems 
and all government agencies for engaging in corruption. 
February 6, during the ARF World Congress, the ARF 
again took the current government to task for its 
record on corruption, sending a clear message to the 
public that the ARF is the only partner in the 
coalition who really fights against corruption.  Some 
observers see the possible implementation of the Anti- 
Corruption Plan by the GOAM as a viability test for the 
coalition.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
COALITION GOVERNMENT: ONE POWER, DIFFERENT IDEOLOGIES 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3. (SBU) The coalition of the three leading political 
parties is not so much an alliance of ideologies, but 
rather a marriage of convenience of parties supporting 
President Kocharian.  Within this alliance the parties 
often push issues that are high on their own party 
agendas, even though some of them contradict the 
priorities of other coalition members.  For example, 
during the fall 2003 session of the NA, the Orinats 
Yerkir party put the issue of making whole Soviet era 
bank deposits on the NA\'s agenda.  Although a coalition 
partner raised the issue, Prime Minister Margarian and 
his Republican Party expressly acted against it, while 
the ARF lambasted the Orinats Yerkir party as a \"party 
full of populist ideas.\" 
 
4. (SBU) Intense jockeying over assigning Ministerial, 
Deputy Ministerial and other high-ranking positions 
exposed other weaknesses in the coalition.  The 
Dashnaks (ARF) and Orinats Yerkir ended up with three 
Ministerial portfolios each (out of a total of 16). 
(Note:  According to some experts, we should be looking 
for additional new appointments as the fourth pro- 
Kocharian party in the NA, the Unified Labor Party and 
the \"Peoples Deputy\" fraction join the Coalition.  End 
Note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
COMMENT: THE COALITION\'S ANTI-CORRUPTION CHALLENGE 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (SBU) The fight against corruption, in our view, has 
the potential to become a major challenge for the 
coalition government.  The Dashnaks are likely to take 
a leading role in this debate to convince their 
electorate that they are being consistent with their 
pre-election promises.  During the World Congress held 
in Yerevan on February 6, the leaders of the party 
consistently blamed GOAM officials for using their 
offices to accumulate wealth and for engaging in 
commercial activities.  By contrast, the Republican 
Party, the senior party in the coalition, is trying to 
demonstrate their democratic credentials to the Council 
of Europe by pushing forward the GOAM\'s anti-corruption 
strategy.  Many Western observers, however, view the 
strategy as flawed and are not yet convinced the GOAM 
intends to tackle corruption head-on. 
 
6. (SBU) Nevertheless, the word in political circles in 
Yerevan is that it is the Republican Party that would 
be most affected should the GOAM seriously take on 
corruption, while Orinats Yerkir might set itself up 
almost as an \"outside observer\" on the issue.  Either 
way, the anti-corruption issue has the potential to 
become a test for the Coalition\'s viability.

SUBJECT: ARMENIA WON\'T COMMIT TO SHUTDOWN DATE FOR NUCLEAR 
POWER PLANT: EU PULLS MONEY OFF THE TABLE 
 
 
1. (U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. PROTECT ACCORDINGLY.  NOT 
FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
 
-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
2. (SBU) During the February 10 EU-Armenia working group on 
Armenia Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP), Armenia would not commit 
to a new closure date for the ANPP and the EU side refused 
to convene a donor\'s conference and withdrew its long- 
standing offer of 100 million euro grant towards replacement 
capacity.  Armen Movsisyan, the Minister of Energy, said 
that he would only consider a strategy for closing the plant 
that guaranteed some diversity of electricity supply for 
Armenia and did not result in a significant rise in 
electricity tariffs.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
ARMENIA IS WILLING TO OPERATE ANPP UNTIL 2015, MAYBE LONGER 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The European Commission\'s side, led by Hugues 
Mingarelli, Director of the Directorate for External 
Relations with Eastern Europe, sought to get a commitment on 
a new closure date for the ANPP and a plan for assistance in 
order to build replacement capacity for the plant.  The 
Armenian side, which comprised Armen Movsisyan, the Minister 
of Energy, Karen Chshmarityan, the Minister of Trade and 
Economic Development, and Ruben Shugaryan, Deputy Foreign 
Minister, had bigger ideas.  First, the Armenian side did 
not concede that the ANPP was inherently unsafe.  ANPP\'s 
head, Gagik Markosyan, gave a very detailed presentation on 
recent safety upgrades.  (Note:  US DOE programs in 
combination with those of the EU are responsible for nearly 
all the upgrades mentioned.  End Note.)  They said that the 
plant could be safely operated until 2015, and could be 
operated for longer with an extension upgrade common for 
similar plants. 
 
--------------------------- 
HAPPINESS IS MANY PIPELINES 
--------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) While Minister Movsisyan was careful to avoid 
saying that this was their plan, all GOAM representatives 
expressed the view that any acceptable agreement to close 
the plant early must keep electricity prices stable and not 
reduce diversity in Armenia\'s energy sources.  The 
Armenian\'s were concerned by the findings of the EU 
consultant who said that Armenia has enough existing 
capacity to close the plant and not have shortages in the 
near term.  This was in part on the agreed grounds that this 
would then lead to 85 percent of their electricity supply 
depending on fuel for gas-fired generation plants supplied 
via the high-pressure pipeline through Georgia.  The parties 
agreed that the pipeline is in poor condition and needs 
investment of USD 140 million, most of which would be in 
Georgia.  While the GOAM did include among their strategic 
investments the proposal for a new combined cycle thermal 
plant proposed by the Japanese, they did not propose this to 
be considered for use of the EU funds to replace ANPP. 
Instead, they outlined a USD 800 million energy strategy 
that went far beyond the scope of just replacing ANPP\'s 
capacity. 
 
5. (U) Background.  Armenia produced 5,188 GWh of 
electricity last year, and consumption has remained 
generally constant since 1999 (normalized for last year\'s 
cold winter), although GNP has grown significantly. 
Forecasts do not, therefore, link GNP growth directly to 
growth in energy consumption.  Future electricity demand 
will increase, but probably modestly.  The current installed 
capacity of 3,157 MW, comprising nuclear (440 MW), hydro 
(961 MW) and gas-fired (1756 MW) generation units 
significantly exceeds the national peak demand, allowing 
Armenia to export energy.  In 2003, hydro accounted for 38 
percent of total generation, thermal plants for 27 percent 
and ANPP for 35 percent.  Were the ANPP to close tomorrow, 
installed capacity of the other generation plants could meet 
Armenia\'s electricity demand now and in the near future, but 
the energy would be much more expensive.  Closing the ANPP 
would raise variable costs by USD 30-45 million the first 
year and total costs by USD 80-90 million (or 80 percent) 
per year. 
----------- 
PIPE DREAMS 
----------- 
6. (SBU) In outlining Armenia\'s energy strategy, the 
Minister of Energy said Armenia\'s first energy priority was 
to build a pipeline with Iran, costing USD 120 million of 
Armenian investment.  (Note:  This issue, which we believe 
is not economically viable, will be addressed septel.  End 
Note.)  The strategy list also included a new 600 MW nuclear 
reactor and a USD 400 million project to develop wind energy 
resources among others, but the ministry did not propose any 
way to finance these alternative projects.  Comment:  While 
all these projects could plausibly meet Armenia\'s supply and 
diversity needs, none are financially feasible under current 
price regimes.  The Regulatory Commission announced a tariff 
of 7 cents/KWh for wind-generated electricity, more than 
twice the tariff from other sources.  Although the high 
tariff will encourage investment in small wind projects (40 
MW) currently on the table, the cost to consumers at this 
tariff would be prohibitive if wind-generated electricity 
accounted for a more substantial share of overall 
production.   While ultimately Armenia may find a way to 
finance one or more of these projects as a means to ensure 
diversity of energy supply, the government\'s plan also hints 
at a possible step backwards.  If it involves heavy 
government involvement in a new energy generation projects, 
it is at odds with the stated policy of moving to complete 
privatization and create a regulatory framework that allows 
private industry and the market to decide on the cheapest 
means of producing electricity.  End Comment. 
 
---------------------- 
EU MONEY OFF THE TABLE 
---------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The EU noted that the Armenians clearly had now 
articulated energy security concerns that went well beyond 
their previous closure commitment and Mingarelli concluded 
that this meant that the EU would need to reflect on and 
review its previous commitment of support for replacement 
generation.  They would now place future plans for energy 
sector support (if any) in the context of overall 
development of the EU-Armenian relationship.  He indicated 
consideration of next steps would be placed in the broader 
context of the EU-Armenia Partnership and Cooperation 
Committee, which will next meet in June 2004.  Comment: 
Despite the withdrawal of the EU offer, the Armenians got 
what they wanted.  They now have no obligation to close the 
ANPP by any date certain.  They have reframed the issue of 
an early closure in terms of their overall energy 
diversification problem, raising the stakes to include a 
project that will maintain their current production 
diversity but would not be feasible with private investment 
alone.  In the scenario where large-scale international 
assistance is not forthcoming, they have bought themselves a 
decade to worry about diversity and security of energy 
supply in a post ANPP Armenia.  One key issue the GOAM is 
studiously avoiding is financing ANPP shutdown costs, a bill 
that will come due at a yet-to-be-determined but inevitable 
future date.  The EU\'s withdrawal has left an opportunity 
for the US to propose, alone or in concert with the EU, new 
solutions to Armenia\'s energy problem.

------------------------------------------ 
MFA COMES HOME WITH LESS THAN IT HOPED FOR 
------------------------------------------ 
 
1. (C) MFA Turkey Desk Officer Anahit Harutunyan told us 
February 13 that the MFA returned from the latest GOAM-GOT 
technical meeting having accomplished less than it had hoped 
for, specifically regarding a potential border opening or 
scheduling regular encounters between FMs Oskanian and Gul. 
Harutunyan called the meeting, held the first week of 
February in Vienna with MFA Office Directors from both 
countries, the \"least productive\" of the past year. 
Discussion of Nagorno-Karabagh reportedly dominated most of 
the conversation and kept the participants from working 
through their planned agenda.  She stopped short of assigning 
blame for the current impasse but shared her impression that 
recent pressure on Turkey by Azerbaijani President Aliyev had 
spooked her bureaucratic counterparts. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
GOAM HOPEFUL FOR REGULAR OSKANIAN-GUL CONTACT 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Harutunyan commented that, despite the sluggish pace 
of the recent meeting, the MFA was pleased that the topic of 
regularly scheduled meetings between FMs Oskanian and Gul was 
now at least an issue of discussion.  She said that the FMs 
would likely speak on the telephone in early March and said 
that the GOAM was anxious to schedule stand-alone meetings as 
opposed to pull-asides during multilateral events.  She 
reiterated that the GOAM wanted the border with Turkey opened 
as soon as possible but noted that FM Oskanian\'s optimism on 
the subject did not match the expectations of bureaucrats 
managing the day-to-day aspects of the issue.  She thanked 
the USG for recent comments by Secretary Powell supporting an 
open border during his meeting with Turkish FM Gul in Tbilisi.

COMMENT

3. (C) Comment:  Harutunyan\'s measured reaction regarding 
opening the border contrasted sharply to the upbeat 
predictions of FM Oskanian earlier this year.  Her comments, 
together with recent remarks by Middle East Division Chief 
Karen Mirzoyan, underscore the need for public intervention 
by high-level leaders if bureaucrats from both countries are 
to have sufficient room to maneuver closer together.

--------------------- 
GOAM WITH US ON CUBA? 
--------------------- 
 
1. (C) We discussed UNCHR issues and ways to more effectively 
pursue continuing USG policy priorities at the UN with MFA UN 
Division Chief Artak Apitonian February 11 (reftel). 
Apitonian credited the apparent decline in USG-GOAM voting 
coincidence during the 58th UNGA as a reaction to \"more 
aggressive USG multilateral approaches on the Middle East\" 
rather than fundamental disagreements on policy.  He 
emphasized the GOAM\'s previous voting record and 2003 record 
on disarmament issues as indicative of an overall cooperative 
relationship with the USG in Geneva and New York.  He 
predicted that the GOAM would support more USG initiatives 
during 2004 through fewer absention votes and possible 
co-sponsorship of key resolutions.  He hinted that the GOAM 
might be able to support the USG on this year\'s Cuba 
resolution if approached with enough advance notice. 
 
------------------------ 
EARLIER DEMARCHES USEFUL 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) Apitonian said there was broad agreement among GOAM 
representatives in Yerevan and New York that the proposed 
Democracy Caucus would offer a \"less politicized\" forum in 
which the GOAM could openly support USG-proposed measures 
without the fear of pressure or backlash from the Non-Aligned 
States (NAS).  He suggested, however, that the USG could 
better engage the GOAM on CHR issues this year if it would 
demarche the MFA, in addition to representatives in Geneva, 
earlier in the process.  He claimed that the FM and Deputy 
Ministers had been increasingly active on multilateral issues 
over the past year and predicted a relative decline in the 
importance of the GOAM\'s missions in Geneva and New York as 
this trend continues. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
3. (C) The MFA\'s heightened interest in multilateral 
mechanics is due in part to Armenia\'s current candidature for 
re-election to the CHR, which the GOAM views as its highest 
profile ambition on the multilateral scene.  The MFA\'s 
multilateral department is at long last fully staffed and 
generally responsive to Embassy requests.  Engaging early and 
often with the MFA will no doubt help counterbalance voting 
pressure from the NAS and European countries.  Post requests 
Department assistance in identifying which issues it can 
preview with the GOAM to lay the groundwork for better CHR 
and UNGA cooperation this year.

UNIVERSITIES

accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Widespread corruption in the Armenian 
university system has severely tarnished the reputation 
of once prestigious institutions and degraded the 
quality of education provided to Armenian students. 
Students, NGO members and government officials describe 
a system consumed with bribery, patronage and other 
corrupt practices.  Inadequate salaries for professors, 
cultural acceptance of patronage networks and student 
draft deferments perpetuate a system with numerous 
negative societal consequences, including shutting 
women out of post-graduate programs and producing 
graduates with limited professional competencies. 
Despite recent GOAM efforts to initiate anti-corruption 
programs, the university system presents substantial 
obstacles to reform efforts.  End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
EDUCATION FOR SALE 
------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) Current and former students told us that the 
Armenian university system is corrupt at all levels. 
Salaries for professors and university administrators 
are woefully inadequate, creating a system where 
university admission and grades are openly \"for sale.\" 
One Yerevan State student informed us that most 
students \"don\'t contribute to the development of the 
university, they contribute to the budget of the 
university.\"  Students describe professors who offer 
\"sample exams\" on test days for a minimal fee, up to 
the highest marks for an entire course for USD 20-100. 
A culture of conspicuous consumption has developed in 
certain departments (most notably the social sciences), 
where students brag of their perfect marks as a not-too- 
subtle reference to their affluence.  Students assured 
us that those who choose to study rather than bribe 
their professors rarely face punitive grading; the 
system has, however, developed an incentive structure 
that encourages students to pay rather than take a 
chance on their own academic performance.  Alumni of 
the post-graduate American University of Armenia (AUA), 
an institution established by Diaspora groups, the 
University of California and USAID in 1991, contend 
that in Armenia only the AUA programs are \"clean\" and 
students\' assessment is performance based. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
A GOOD FRIEND BETTER THAN A GOOD CITIZEN 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Armenians also describe a cultural dimension 
to the corruption.  Armenians generally have large 
support networks of friends and family that are 
expected to provide assistance in social and business 
affairs.  Even distant relatives are obligated to use 
their personal connections to university administrators 
and professors in lobbying for special consideration 
during the admissions process.  Most Armenians do not 
consider such behavior as further corrupting the 
system, seeing these social networks as a vital part of 
Armenia\'s culture.  As the mother of a university-age 
student told us, \"If I have to decide between being a 
good family member and friend or good citizen, I must 
choose my friends and family.\" 
 
----------------------------- 
CONSCRIPTION FUELS CORRUPTION 
----------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Military conscription encourages further 
corruption and degradation of the Armenian higher 
education system.  At age 18, the government requires 
Armenian men to perform two years of military service, 
often under poor conditions.  Students may defer their 
military service while enrolled in undergraduate or 
master\'s programs (up to six years), motivating many 
men to prolong their studies as long as possible. 
Students tell us how parents save money to pay off the 
university testing board and use personal contacts to 
pressure school administrators to admit their otherwise 
unqualified or unmotivated sons.  Current Yerevan State 
students describe an intellectual environment that is 
severely corroded by draft \'deferrers\' who view their 
time at the university as means for postponing the 
inevitable rather than a period for serious academic 
study. 
 
-------------------- 
NO WOMEN SCIENTISTS? 
-------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Students who complete a full-time doctorate 
program at a public university are entirely exempt from 
conscription.  The limited supply of Ph.D. degrees 
granted by public universities (usually two per 
department) coupled with Armenian men\'s high demand for 
these degrees has created a system where women have 
been increasingly shut out of doctoral programs.  The 
National Statistics Service reports that in 2002, out 
of the 155 full-time Ph.D. students, 6 were female. 
Female undergraduate students from Yerevan State told 
us that they simply would not be competitive in the 
doctoral admissions process, as men pay large bribes to 
secure the seats in the programs.  Women also face 
substantial family pressure not to compete against male 
relatives for admission to Ph.D. programs.  The market- 
driven competition for these programs, which favors the 
better connected and well-funded, dilutes the quality 
of once prestigious doctoral programs in the sciences 
and humanities. 
 
----------------------------------- 
TOUGH STRUGGLE TO BATTLE CORRUPTION 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) In October 2003, President Kocharian appointed 
Baghrat Yesayan as the Presidential Advisor on 
Corruption.  Yesayan launched public hearings into what 
he considered the 10 most corrupt sectors of Armenian 
society (including education, medical services, 
utilities and the police), and began issuing formal 
recommendations on reforms necessary to combat the 
corruption.  Yesayan made the higher education system 
his first priority and submitted his findings in 
January.  Yesayan told us that most of the anecdotes 
shared by students were accurate and noted that the 
widespread corruption in the university system had 
substantially degraded the quality of Armenian higher 
education.  He also told us that unless the GOAM 
addressed university corruption in its entirety, little 
substantive progress would be made. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) Corruption throughout the Armenian university 
system is increasingly affecting broader societal 
interests.  In recent years, the number of women 
pursuing post-graduate degrees has declined to minimal 
levels.  If the trends continue, a generation of women 
could be excluded from certain professions, especially 
the sciences.  Since diplomas from Armenian 
universities do not demonstrate that a recent graduate 
has the skills necessary for professional work, some 
private-sector employers require applicants to undergo 
professional competency tests as part of the 
application process.  A recent study by Japonica 
Intersectoral surveyed Armenian employers and found 
\"general discontent with core competencies and 
professional skills demonstrated by recent graduates.\" 
Most employers (especially the government), however, 
recognize that most recent graduates are equally 
unqualified, and hire employees the same way students 
are frequently admitted to the university: by reaching 
an accommodation with the applicant\'s support network. 
 
9. (SBU) Despite recent government attempts to address 
corruption, it remains deeply engrained.  The 
university system is an example of an Armenian 
institution that operates within a predictable range of 
bribery, patronage and other forms of corruption.  The 
depth of the problem is compounded by the multiple 
factors perpetuating it: the GOAM could address some of 
the causes of the corruption by eliminating student 
military deferments (the National Assembly is currently 
considering such a bill that would end deferments and 
exemptions for post-graduate study), or somehow finding 
revenue in a small budget to raise professors\' 
salaries.  But no government program could counter the 
cultural acceptance of partiality and bias in tit-for- 
tat deal making.  The GOAM is increasingly willing to 
entertain proposals to combat corruption, but, as 
Yasayan said, a lot of work is necessary to \"redefine 
practices and attitudes.\"

SUBJECT: \"A POLITICAL MURDER\": ARMENIAN MEDIA REACTION 
TO THE INCIDENT IN BUDAPEST 
 
1.  SUMMARY: Armenian mass media widely covered the 
murder of Lieutenant Gurgen Markarian who was attending 
a NATO training course in Hungary.  Echoing the 
official press statements made by the Ministries of 
Defense and Foreign Affairs, almost all local media 
outlets connected this crime to the general policy of 
Azerbaijan\'s authorities towards Armenia.  END SUMMARY 
 
STATEMENT BY ARMENIA\'S DEFENSE MINISTRY 
 
2. In an official statement, the Defense Ministry said 
it was \"deeply shocked\" by the officer\'s death and 
pledged to do \"everything possible and impossible to 
subject the murderer arrested by the Hungarian 
authorities to deserved punishment.\"  The Defense 
Ministry added: \"This atrocious murder is the direct 
consequence of Azerbaijan\'s policy aimed at kindling 
hatred towards the Armenian people.\"  \"We hope that the 
international community will draw corresponding 
conclusions and will properly assess the situation,\" 
the Armenian Defense Ministry concluded. 
 
STATEMENT BY ARMENIA\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY 
 
3. The Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that 
\"this crime is the logical consequence of the anti- 
Armenian hysteria that has been unleashed by the Azeri 
authorities over the years and of the war-mongering 
militarist propaganda of recent months, which 
consistently infects all of Azeri society.\"  \"It is 
evident that such state policy has crossed the bounds, 
and officials representing Azerbaijan abroad can commit 
cold-blooded murder.\"  \"The Ministry expects that the 
international organizations will appropriately assess 
this crime and react.  At the same time, we demand that 
the Hungarian authorities punish the perpetrator to the 
maximum extent of the law.\" 
 
REACTIONS IN THE MEDIA 
 
4. In its article titled \"The Relatives Demand that the 
Murderer Not Be Extradited to Azerbaijan,\" the 
government official Armenian language daily HAYASTANI 
HANRAPETUTIUN (02/23) said that Gurgen Margarian had 
plans for the future after his return - he was going to 
get married and go to the U.S. to study at a military 
academy for two years.  Another article in the same 
newspaper says: \"Even though the deed of the Azeri 
officer-murderer was a surprise, it was not unexpected. 
The obstruction of the Armenian officers\' participation 
in the planning conference for NATO\'s \"Best Joint 
Effort-2004\" in Baku and the forms of this obstruction 
had already indicated that there are some people in 
that country who are obsessed with killing Armenians. 
The Azeris seemed to have known what they were doing 
when they did not allow Armenians to go to Baku, they 
knew that there are some people there who would not be 
able to resist the temptation to smell blood.  On the 
eve of the conference, various parties and 
organizations had stated publicly more than once that 
they would physically assault any Armenian officers who 
might come to Baku.  Essentially, what was not done in 
Baku, was then done in Budapest.\" 
 
5. While commenting on the statement made by the Azeri 
Foreign Ministry expressing its regrets to the family 
of Gurgen Margarian, Centrist Armenian language daily 
AZG (02/23)wrote that \"in the statement, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs indirectly justified Safarov\'s crime 
by noting that the murdered Armenian officer constantly 
humiliated the Azeri officer, whose relatives were 
killed in the Jebrayil (sp.) region during the Karabakh 
war.\" 
 
6. Opposition Armenian daily ARAVOT (02/23) commented 
on the reports published in the Azeri press, saying 
that \"elements of emphasized cynicism can be seen in 
the reactions by the Azeri side.  According to the 
newspaper \"Zerkalo,\" the speaker of the Azeri Ministry 
of Defense, Ramiz Melikov, confirmed the fact of the 
murder, but advised the Armenian side not to jump to 
conclusions.  \"Nobody has the right to call the Azeri 
officer a murderer until he is proven guilty by an 
investigation and a court verdict,\" Melikov said and 
added that at the moment Safarov is being held in 
custody as a suspect.  The fact that the murderer did 
not put up any resistance during his arrest and did not 
deny his guilt says that this was not a usual murder.\" 
\"Nevertheless, it can be assumed that, in all 
likelihood, NATO will refrain from calling this a 
political murder.  The alliance\'s attitude towards the 
Republic of Armenia was already made clear during the 
NATO conference in Baku.\" 
 
7. The pro-government Russian language newspaper NOVOYE 
VREMYA (02/23) wrote: \"A 26-year-old Armenian officer, 
who was undergoing training under the most peaceful 
NATO program, was axed to death in Budapest...  The 
very combination of these words is already nonsense. 
What happened there is completely beyond comprehension, 
regardless of who committed this crime that was 
unprecedented in its cruelty.  This is how this would 
have been taken, if there had been no atrocities in 
Sumgait and Baku, and the long years of futile attempts 
to show to the civilized world what kind of medieval 
brutality the Armenian population of Azerbaijan had to 
face at that time.\"  \"All of this has happened before. 
And it can happen again, unless the international 
community reacts strongly to what has happened.  The 
initial comments on what happened are nothing but 
examples of political correctness.\"  \"From the first, 
the NATO leadership refrained from comments until 
further details of the incident were clarified.  In 
exactly the same way, very recently, it had refrained 
from calling things by their names when Armenian 
officers were not allowed to go to Baku to participate 
in the NATO planning conference.\"  \"We do not want to 
draw parallels, but they are too obvious. In the past, 
because of the ideas of proletarian internationalism, 
the party leadership called the organized massacres in 
Sumgait \"an action by criminal elements.\"  As a result, 
the virus of unpunished evil spread throughout the 
territory of the former USSR.      Sumgait has 
essentially happened again many times over, in many so- 
called \"hot spots\" of that enormous country, and we are 
reaping the consequences to this day.\" 
 
8. Dashnak-affiliated HAYOTS ASHKHAR newspaper (02/23) 
qualifies this crime as political and calls on 
international organizations as well as NATO to 
recognize it as such.  \"This is simply a call to arms 
for Armenia and for the international organization, 
namely NATO, responsible for the implementation of the 
Partnership for Peace program. This factually 
automatically discredits the principle of \"partnership 
for peace\" and turns it into the principle of \"murder 
for war,\" which is diametrically opposed to the spirit 
of the NATO program.  No matter how hard they try, the 
Hungarian authorities also cannot deny that the murder 
was clearly politically motivated.  NATO cannot deny 
that either.\"  \"They cannot deny this for the simple 
reason that this was already characterized as such by 
the head of the press service of the Azeri Ministry of 
Defense, Ramiz Melikov, on Azeri state television.  He 
said that the Azeri officer who committed the crime was 
a resident of the region of Jebrayil, whose relatives 
were killed during the Karabakh war.  This means that 
the crime was committed not only by an officer who 
officially represented Azerbaijan under the Partnership 
for Peace program, but that the officer wanted to kill 
not a specific person (Gurgen Margarian), but a 
representative of a specific nation and specific 
country, an Armenian and an officer of the Armenian 
Armed Forces.  After all, what happened cannot be 
presented as the result of a mundane or personal 
dispute because the murderer tried to kill the other 
Armenian officer as well.\"  \"We think that such cruel 
and insolent behavior by not only the Azeri officer, 
but also by other Azeri officials has to do with the 
fact that NATO recently failed to blame Azeri 
authorities for having prohibited the participation of 
Armenian officers at a Partnership for Peace conference 
in Baku.\"  \"The Azeri authorities bear full 
responsibility for the cruel political murder in 
Budapest, where NATO may encourage Azerbaijan to commit 
new and crueler crimes by keeping silence or 
considering this a simple criminal act, i.e. by 
ignoring once again the obvious facts and allowing 
impunity.\"

SPECULATION ABOUT A DEFENSIVE KOCHARIAN

1. (U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please treat 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) President Robert Kocharian\'s February 18 
extended press conference sparked speculation about 
his political posturing vis-a-vis an increasingly 
vocal opposition.  During the rare two-hour TV 
interview, Kocharian took pains to portray himself 
as a calm, unfettered executive in charge of his 
country.  He covered the entire range of political 
issues, dedicating significant time to U.S.-Armenia 
relations, Nagorno-Karabakh negotiations and 
corruption.  He suggested that the decline in USG 
military assistance to Armenia may have resulted 
from Armenia\'s lukewarm response to coalition calls 
for help with the war in Iraq.  His sharp criticism 
of local opposition leaders included a reprimand for 
the controversial January speeches by opposition 
parliamentarians at the Parliamentary Council of the 
Council of Europe (PACE).  Kocharian\'s nonchalant 
performance notwithstanding, his rare decision to go 
on the offensive may indicate that he (or those 
close to him) senses the need to maintain a firm 
grip on public perception.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
UNCOMMON AIR TIME FOR KOCHARIAN 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) President Robert Kocharian\'s two-hour 
television interview February 18 was his most 
extensive press availability since the 2003 
presidential elections.  Four local journalists from 
mostly pro-government television stations 
participated in the interview.  Kocharian took pains 
to portray himself as a calm, unfettered executive 
in charge of his country during his mostly 
unrehearsed responses to journalists\' questions. 
Media analysts noted Kocharian\'s efforts to minimize 
bombastic language and called his interview \"loaded\" 
with nuanced messages to opposition leaders and the 
international community. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
A NOT-SO-SUBTLE WARNING TO THE OPPOSITION 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Kocharian acknowledged the increased 
chatter in the political community about opposition 
initiatives to oust him from power.  Kocharian 
stated unequivocally that the GOAM would counter 
extra-constitutional measures and warned that \"we 
[the government] have the resources\" to quell such 
movements.  Kocharian categorized opposition protest 
methods as cowardly, including the call for street 
protests and rallies.  He had harsh words for 
opposition parliamentarians who openly criticized 
his administration during January 2004 meetings of 
the Parliamentary Commission of the Council of 
Europe (PACE).  Kocharian stopped just short of 
daring the opposition to put legal mechanisms of 
impeachment or national referendum into play. 
(Note:  Kocharian is well aware that the pro- 
government majority in parliament would not allow 
such legal maneuvering at this time.  End Note.) 
 
-------------------------------- 
MISQUOTE ON US-ARMENIA RELATIONS 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Kocharian responded to journalists\' 
questions regarding U.S.-Armenia relations by 
defending his administration\'s policy of 
\"complementarity\" with Russia and the U.S.  When 
asked whether or not the GOAM was worried about a 
perceived increase in U.S. interest in the Caucasus, 
Kocharian replied, \"The increase in the USG\'s role 
in the South Cacasus can favor Armenia, including 
the settlement of the N-K conflict.\"  (Note:  The 
President\'s response was widely misquoted in Armenia 
the following day, implying a more negative answer. 
This error has yet to be clarified by the 
President\'s office, but sources in Diaspora lobby 
groups tell the us that they will pressure news 
agencies to correct the error.  End Note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
KOCHARIAN:  \"INDEPENDENCE [ON IRAQ] HAD ITS PRICE\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6. (SBU) Journalists peppered Kocharian with 
questions about anticipated lower levels of USG 
military assistance to Armenia vis-a-vis USG 
military assistance destined for Azerbaijan. 
Kocharian refrained from outwardly criticizing the 
USG, but expressed nuanced disappointment that the 
USG had not \"maintained its promises to the American- 
Armenian community.\"  He hypothesized that the 
decrease in military assistance was a commensurate 
USG response to Armenia\'s lukewarm cooperation with 
coalition efforts during the war with Iraq. 
Armenia\'s \"independence [on the Iraq issue],\" he 
said, \"had its price, and yet its value.\" 
 
-------------------- 
COMMENT:  \"WHY NOW?\" 
-------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Perhaps more important than Kocharian\'s 
remarks themselves was the timing of the press 
availability.  This interview may have been a 
reaction to the opposition\'s recent reentry into the 
policy fray following the splashy January speeches 
at PACE and the controversial Dashnak World Congress 
(reftel).  Alternatively, some within the Kocharian 
administration believe that Kocharian is irritated 
by the \"exaggerated, overly congratulatory\" 
attention Western governments, local opposition and 
policy think tanks have paid to Georgia over the 
past few months.  This interview may have been an 
effort to re-establish Kocharian\'s political prowess 
and defuse any hopes for a \"rose revolution\" in 
Armenia.  Lastly, some speculate that lower USG 
military assistance levels could be a potentially 
fatal policy issue for Kocharian and see the 
interview as a convenient way for him to pass the 
blame to the National Assembly and other more 
strongly pro-Russian political forces. 
 
8. (SBU) Regardless of the reason, and Kocharian\'s 
nonchalant performance during the interview 
notwithstanding, his rare decision to go on the 
media offensive indicates that he, or those close to 
him, senses the need to maintain a firm grip on 
public perception.  Ironically, it appears that the 
interview has done more to capture the attention of 
local conspiracy theorists than quell those who 
question Kocharian\'s authority.  Although Kocharian 
faces a potentially trying Spring given opposition 
leaders\' calls for increased rallies and protests, 
we believe the prospects for any major political 
upheaval remain remote.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) On February 18, 2004, we met with Ashot 
Martirosyan, the head of the Armenian Nuclear Regulatory 
Agency (ANRA) to encourage Armenia to commit to the IAEA 
Code of Conduct on Radioactive Sources (ref A), to follow up 
on concerns about the discovery of a radioactive source 
found by the customs service at the Iranian border, and to 
inquire about the status and of ANRA after its 
reorganization under the Ministry of Nature Protection 
(MNP)(ref B).  Martirosyan said that he believed that the 
government intended to commit in writing to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Code of Conduct, 
confirmed that GOAM customs authorities found and seized an 
unregistered radioactive source (strontium 90) at the 
Iranian border crossing, and said that the status of ANRA 
has caused bureaucratic problems, especially in his 
cooperation with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC), but that a compromise resolution, again changing the 
status of ANRA, is forthcoming.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
ANRA:  ARMENIA LIKELY TO COMMIT TO IAEA CODE OF CONDUCT 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3. (SBU) Martirosyan told us that he expected Armenia to 
make a political commitment, in the form of a letter to the 
IAEA Director general, that the government is working toward 
following the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources (ref A).  Mr. Martirosyan responding to 
Secretary Powell\'s letter urging Armenia to commit, said 
 
SIPDIS 
that there \"had been a lot of talk recently\" that led him to 
believe that Armenia would commit. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
ARMENIAN CUSTOMS FINDS RADIOACTIVE SOURCE AT IRANIAN BORDER 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Martirosyan confirmed recent press reports that 
customs officers found and seized a radioactive source 
(strontium 90) at the Iranian border crossing.  The source 
was in a pile of scrap metal being exported from Armenia. 
Border guards found the metallic container of the source 
badly damaged and the major part of the material absent. 
Martirosyan said that the source is now in the radioactive 
waste storage facility (RADON).  He added that this source 
had not been registered in Armenia:  he has contacted the 
Russian Federation for information about its origin. 
According to Martirosyan, ANRA has been involved since the 
discovery of the source and has also sent a report to IAEA. 
(Note:  For a copy of the IAEA report or photographs of the 
source, e-mail Econoff at gudiet@state.gov.  End Note.) 
 
--------------------------- 
ANRA\'S STATUS STILL IN FLUX 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) While Martirosyan claims that ANRA\'s placement 
under the Ministry of Nature Protection (MNP) is temporary, 
ANRA remains in the same limbo that it was in a year ago. 
Martirosyan claimed that his office had been moved under the 
MNP due to a government decision that no agencies would 
report directly to the prime minister.  (Note:  This 
decision was ostensibly part of an overall effort to 
consolidate government.  End Note.)  He acknowledged that 
the ANRA\'s current status violates Armenia\'s Atomic Law, but 
added that it had been a temporary measure.  The Minister of 
Nature Protection has asked him to draw up a plan that would 
give ANRA a legal status (probably as committee) that would 
have more autonomy than an inspectorate.  He said that 
President Kocharian is aware of ANRA\'s shaky status and that 
they would discuss proposals for a solution \"in the coming 
days.\"  He did not seem optimistic that ANRA would 
completely regain its former independent status. 
 
6. (SBU) In a separate, informal meeting February 23, Dr. 
Aram Gevorgyan, Head of Department of Atomic Energy, 
Ministry of Energy, said that ANRA would not change status. 
He said that at a meeting about the future of ANRA, 
President Kocharian asked Martirosyan when the last time 
Martirosyan had met with the Prime Minister.  When the 
latter replied \"1998,\" Kocharian noted that ANRA probably 
had better access to the government under the MNP than it 
did before.  Comment:  It\'s been more than one year since 
Martirosyan last told us that the government would soon 
consider proposals to resolve ANRA\'s status (ref B). 
Martirosyan gave us no reason to believe that a resolution 
is around the corner, and Gevorgyan strongly implied that 
moving ANRA again is a non-starter for the government at 
this time.  End Comment. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
ANRA\'S STATUS CAUSES BUREAUCRATIC PROBLEMS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7. (SBU) Speaking about the effects of ANRA\'s status, 
Martirosyan cited two legal problems:  ANRA cannot negotiate 
directly with assistance providers, like the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Agency (NRC), and ANRA\'s legal mandate is far 
narrower than its necessary activities.  ANRA\'s status does 
not allow it to sign on its own behalf a Memorandum of 
Cooperation with the NRC.  (Note:  Martirosyan told us that 
the U.S. position is that the NRC memorandum of cooperation 
can only be established with its counterpart regulatory 
agency and not with a ministry.  End Note.)  According to 
Martirosyan, this has held up important assistance programs 
coming from the United States.  Another legal problem stems 
from ANRA\'s official status as an inspectorate.  Although he 
claims everyone is currently ignoring this legal conflict, 
an inspectorate is empowered only to make inspections and 
impose sanctions, but cannot wield regulatory authority. 
ANRA has nevertheless carried on the same functions as 
before: licensing and setting requirements through norms and 
regulations.  Martirosyan told us he did not feel that he 
had lost control over substantive issues of regulation. 
 
8. (SBU) ANRA has recently experienced other administrative 
difficulties:  the transfer to MNP put the staff in lower 
pay brackets, and ANRA now has a hard time recruiting and 
retaining its staff.  According to Martirosyan, seven of 
their 26 positions are vacant, and three current employees 
intend to leave.  Head of ANRA\'s Nuclear Information and 
Foreign Affairs Section, Vladimir Kurghinyan, told us he 
intended to leave to take a position for IAEA in Vienna. 
Kurghinyan added that it was difficult to recruit capable 
new people because the organization\'s new status lacked 
prestige and qualified candidates did not want to take the 
civil service exam. 
 
---------------------- 
MARTIROSYAN FLUNKS OUT 
---------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Not least of ANRA\'s staffing worries is the 
precarious position of Martirosyan himself.  Because ANRA is 
under the MNP, employees are subject the Civil Service Law 
which requires that all civil servants pass the civil 
service exam.  Martirosyan explained that he failed the 
exam, which covers only the provision of the civil service 
law and nothing about nuclear regulation.  Having failed the 
exam, MNP had to fire Martirosyan from the Civil Service, 
but they have retained him in his same position as a 
contractor because, he said, no qualified civil servant has 
sought the position. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) Martirosyan is clearly concerned about the ongoing 
changes in his agency.  While he believes that ANRA\'s status 
within the bureaucracy will change, he seemed unconvinced 
that ANRA would again become an independent agency. 
Martirosyan has not lost substantive control over the 
agency\'s responsibilities, but ANRA\'s legal limbo has 
created bureaucratic problems that influence ANRA\'s work in 
concrete ways, not least by holding up USG Assistance and 
making it difficult to recruit and retain staff. 
Martirosyan was grateful for U.S. expressions of concern 
about the GOAM decision, and remained keen to resolve the 
status of ANRA so that he could address pressing concerns of 
staff problems and his own tenure.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenian officials have again proposed a gas 
pipeline from Iran to Armenia as a way to alleviate 
Armenia\'s concerns about the future diversity of energy 
sources.  According to the Armenian Minister of Energy, 
speaking at a February 10th meeting, Armenia may at 
some point sign an agreement with the Iranian Oil and 
Gas Minister to purchase one billion cubic meters of 
gas two years from now.  Other key factors, however, 
including the price of gas and the size of the 
pipeline, do not figure into the proposed deal, 
indicating that there is significantly less to the 
agreement than it appears and that the pipeline is 
still more a farfetched desire of the government than a 
realizable goal.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
HOPE DIES LAST:  A PIPELINE IS STILL BAD BUSINESS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenia has long seen a potential gas pipeline 
from Iran as way to guarantee their energy supply after 
the inevitable nuclear power plant (ANPP).   (Note:  A 
gas pipeline through Georgia currently provides fuel to 
all of Armenia\'s thermal power plants, generating 45 
percent of Armenia\'s electricity, 85 percent of all non- 
nuclear energy.  End Note.)  But after ten years of 
discussions the pipeline project is going nowhere: 
Armenia\'s demand for gas from Iran is not, in itself, 
strong enough to justify the expense of building a 
pipeline.  A pipeline only makes sense if the donor 
community would pay for it (perhaps in exchange for 
closing ANPP), or if the price of gas from Russia were 
to rise to such levels that a pipeline would become 
competitive for private investment. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
UNCERTAINTIES CAST DOUBT ON A QUICK DEAL 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Although the Iranian Oil and Gas Minister is 
planning to visit Armenia to consider an agreement on 
the purchase of gas in the future, the uncertainty of 
terms suggests that the Armenians do not have a 
workable plan.  Most importantly, the price of the gas 
remains unspecified.  Besides casting a shadow on the 
validity of the deal, it casts too much doubt on the 
financial feasibility to justify the large capital 
outlay (USD 120 million) to build the pipeline.  When 
discussing the pipeline at the recent EU-Armenia 
Metzamor Working Group (septel), the Minister of Energy 
expounded on two other possibilities for the pipeline: 
a larger-diameter 550 km-long pipe up to Georgian 
border with a yearly capacity of 4.5 billion cubic 
meters, or another pipeline from Yerevan to Eastern 
Turkey.  Because each these plans would require very 
different pipelines, in terms of diameter and through- 
put, and the financial terms would vary widely in each 
scenario, it is clear that those who are proposing the 
pipeline are still very much in the ideas stage and are 
not yet ready to commit resources to the project.  When 
we spoke February 23 with Deputy Minister of Energy 
Areg Galstyan, in charge of development of the Armenian 
Energy Sector, he commented that he was not familiar 
with the details about the proposed pipeline project. 
 
---------------------------- 
Comments:  Exploring Options 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Anticipating the inevitable closure of ANPP, 
Armenia expects to pursue some strategy that reduces 
its reliance on the gas pipeline through Georgia. 
While an Iran-Armenia pipeline would be more expensive 
than buying Russian gas, it may well be the cheapest 
among Armenia\'s other options.  But as long as the GOAM 
is unwilling to pass the extra costs of diverse 
sourcing on to consumers, and no international donors 
are forthcoming, there is little or no possibility of 
an Armenian-Iranian gas pipeline project getting off 
the ground.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The GOAM, parliamentarians, and NGOs agree across 
the board in calling the February 19 murder of Armenian 
Lieutenant Gurgen Margarian by an Azerbaijani officer at NATO 
Partnership for Peace (PfP) English training program in 
Budapest a \"political murder,\" and have been widely quoted in 
the press (ref A).  The GOAM has officially condemned the act 
as an obvious consequence of the hostile environment towards 
Armenia fostered by the Azerbaijani leadership.  Both 
pro-government and opposition parliamentarians have called on 
NATO to review its decision to allow Azerbaijan to host the 
PfP exercises Cooperative Best Effort 04.  (Note:  Some 
political analysts have gone so far as to suggest that the 
murder may have been ordered by the Azerbaijani leadership to 
intimidate Armenia into not sending participants to the 
upcoming exercises. End Note.)  A prominent parliamentarian, 
calling the murder \"the second link in the chain,\" told us 
privately that he anticipates strong anti-NATO fall-out and a 
strengthening of anti-Azeri hard-liners\' hands.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
MFA LAMBASTES AZERI \"ANTI-ARMENIAN HYSTERIA\" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a strongly-worded February 19 statement, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the GOAM\'s official 
reaction to the killing of Lieutenant Margarian.  The MFA 
condemned the murder, and stated that \"(the) crime is a 
logical consequence of the anti-Armenian hysteria that has 
been left unreined by the Azeri authorities over the years 
and of the warmongering militarist propaganda of recent 
months, which consistently infects all of Azeri society.\" 
The Ministry of Defense echoed the charges of the MFA in a 
statement, contending \"this atrocious murder is the direct 
consequence of Azerbaijan\'s policy aimed at kindling hatred 
towards the Armenian people.\"  In discussions February 23, 
the MFA\'s NATO desk officer Muhrad Tashcian told us that the 
initial MFA statement remained the official GOAM position and 
that Armenia\'s Ambassador to NATO would be formally 
presenting a complaint to the NATO Secretary-General in a 
meeting February 23.  He suggested that Armenia may request 
that the NATO PfP exercise Cooperative Best Effort 04 (CBE 
04) be moved from Azerbaijan. 
 
------------------------- 
ANTI-NATO BACKLASH LIKELY 
------------------------- 
 
3. (C) National Assembly (NA) Military Affairs Committee 
Chairman Mher Shahgeldian told us that public (and 
parliamentary) sentiment was already building toward a likely 
anti-NATO backlash.  Shahgeldian echoed other political 
leaders and noted that the \"political murder\" was the second 
link in a chain of recent disturbing events related to NATO: 
first, he said, NATO did not protest strongly enough when 
Azerbaijan prevented Armenian participation in the recent 
planning conference for CBE 04, and now, should NATO not 
issue a strongly worded statement condemning Margarian\'s 
murder as \"political,\" pressure would build to hamper 
Armenian cooperation with an \"anti-Armenian NATO.\" 
Shahgeldian insisted that he will do what he can to continue 
what he characterizes as \"strong\" current cooperation, but 
urged the USG to acknowledge the murder as \"clearly 
political.\" 
 
------------------------------ 
MAINSTREAM NGOS NO LESS SHRILL 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) The Fund Against Violation of the Law, an NGO headed 
by new Human Rights Ombudsman Larisa Alaverdian, urged NATO 
to re-evaluate Azerbaijan\'s place within the PfP framework as 
the country\'s leadership has created an environment where 
cooperation where cooperation is impossible.  Styopa 
Safaryan, a Political Analyst at the Armenian Center for 
National And International Studies and recent International 
Visitor participant, told us that it was impossible to rule 
out the involvement of Azerbaijani authorities in the murder. 
 He said that the Azerbaijani government could not 
politically afford to allow Armenians to participate in CBE 
04, and perhaps ordered the killing to intimidate Armenia 
into not participating.  Safaryan contends that this view is 
shared by many regional security analysts. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
DASHNAK YOUTH STAGE SMALL DEMONSTRATION 
--------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The youth group of the Dashnak Party organized a 
small demonstration at the MFA in the afternoon of February 
24.  Approximately 70 youth carried banners calling on the 
international community to respond to the act of \"Azeri 
aggression.\"  They also placed funerary wreaths on the 
sidewalk in front of the building.  Officials in the MFA who 
witnessed the protest told us that no banners contained 
anti-NATO slogans. 
 
------------------------------- 
TEMPERATE COMMENTS HARD TO FIND 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Vazgen Manukian of the National Democratic Union told 
us that there were not enough facts known to make a formal 
conclusion about the case: the alleged murderer could be 
\"mentally-ill or seriously disturbed.\" He noted, however, 
that he is one of only a handful of public figures counseling 
restraint. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) Little attention is paid by either side to the 
occasional cross-border sniper attacks that have resulted in 
a number of other deaths in recent years.  This event, 
however, has galvanized public reaction and will make 
engagement, let alone compromise, even more difficult than it 
has been.  It is undercutting the Armenian side\'s political 
will to engage with Azerbaijan in the Minsk Group process, 
focusing the attention of the public, and government, on an 
unfortunate but unusual case that logically should have no 
bearing on the negotiating process.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Post recommends that Armenia remain off the Special 
301 Watch List for 2004.  Music and video piracy does exist 
in Armenia, but industry losses in the Armenian market are 
probably small and the government is growing more and more 
committed to the protection of intellectual property rights. 
USAID is currently working closely with the GOAM to develop 
an enforcement action plan and IPR-related training 
programs.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
LEGISLATION TRIPS-COMPLIANT 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenia\'s legislation is Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)-compliant, but 
application is not.  Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) 
legislation is new to Armenia, and enforcement officials 
have yet to develop the capacity to enforce intellectual 
property rights.  A new USAID-financed team of experts is 
working with law enforcement agencies to strengthen 
enforcement, with courts and judges to educate them about 
TRIPS and new IPR legislation, and with the State Customs 
Committee to help them IPR regulations at the borders.  To 
move Armenia to the Watch List now would likely hurt rather 
than help these efforts. 
 
4. (SBU) Armenia\'s government is aware that Armenia has IPR 
concerns of its own.  One of Armenia major producers and 
exporters, Yerevan Brandy Company, is taking measures to 
guard against the counterfeiting of its label by foreign 
brandy imposters.  Armenia\'s growing industry in software 
and computer design development also depends on the 
assiduous protection of intellectual property rights. 
Deputy Minister of Trade Tigran Davtian, who is charged to 
meet Armenia\'s WTO commitments, told us that he was 
committed to pursue steady progress towards \"credible 
protection of IPR.\"  He added that, in his opinion, change 
must be steady and comprehensive rather than knee-jerk: 
raiding CD markets could simply send the industry 
underground rather than encourage retailers to stop selling 
pirated goods. 
 
5. (SBU) Post believes that Armenia\'s deficiencies in 
intellectual property protection are not due to a lack of 
will or intention to comply with international standards, 
but rather a lack of enforcement capacity and resources. 
The shift in U.S. assistance from helping Armenia pass TRIPS- 
compliant legislation in the run-up to WTO accession to 
enforcement of that legislation promises steady gains in 
combating piracy in the future.  Post believes that as long 
as the government is working successfully with the USAID- 
financed program to improve IPR enforcement, any change for 
the worse of Armenia\'s status on the Section 301 Watch Lists 
has the potential to do more harm than good.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Nearly one thousand university students in 
Yerevan continued to boycott their classes in protest 
of the proposed \"Law on Military Service\" currently 
before the National Assembly.  The controversial draft 
law, strongly supported by the Ministry of Defense, 
would end all draft deferments for graduate study.  The 
student protestors claim that the law dilutes the 
quality of Armenian science, and have formed an 
umbrella group \"For the Development of Science\" to 
coordinate future demonstrations and lobbying efforts. 
The group plans further public demonstrations and a 
march to the National Assembly (NA) in the next five 
days.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO CONSIDER CONSCRIPTION REFORMS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3. (U) The GOAM recently submitted \"The Law on Military 
Service\" to the National Assembly for consideration. 
The proposed law removes draft deferments for students 
in master\'s programs and the full exclusion provided to 
full-time Ph.D. students.  (Note:  The National 
Statistical Service reports that 149 of the 155 full- 
time Ph.D. students in Armenia are men.  End Note.) 
All Armenian men would be required to serve in the 
army, either when the reach the age 18 or when they 
finish their four-year undergraduate education.  The 
GOAM sees two benefits to this law:  an additional 
1,000 men eligible for military service yearly, and a 
more academically dedicated and diverse applicant pool 
for post-graduate programs.  The National Assembly will 
vote on the draft law in its first reading on March 1 
or 2. 
 
------------------------------ 
MALE STUDENTS PROTEST, BOYCOTT 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) Male undergraduate and graduate students 
strongly oppose the law.  Several Ph.D. students 
created the group \"For the Development of Science\" to 
coordinate student opposition to the bill.  The group 
staged protests at Yerevan State University February 18- 
20, in which approximately 1000 students participated, 
and have encouraged a boycott of classes since February 
18.  Minister of Defense Serzh Sarksian convened a town- 
hall style meeting for youth that the action group also 
boycotted after discovering that the majority of the 
120 seats had been reserved for the pro-government 
National Youth Council.  Armenian television footage 
showed the meeting as almost \"Komsomol-like\" with the 
youth looking approvingly on as Sarksian lectured about 
civic virtues. 
 
------------------------ 
FOR THE SAKE OF SCIENCE! 
------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) The protestors claim that the law will degrade 
the quality of Armenian science.  In a press conference 
held on February 18, leaders of \"For the Development of 
Science\" stated that they were not seeking to avoid 
their own military service, rather preserve the 
integrity of the Armenian scientific field.  The 
students argue that if they are not allowed to directly 
follow their undergraduate studies with a master\'s or 
Ph.D. program, they may lose interest in academics and 
never return to school.  They further contend that 
dedicated students may flee the country in a \"brain- 
drain\" to pursue studies elsewhere and never return to 
Armenia if the law is passed. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
MAYOR\'S OFFICE DENIES PERMITS FOR FUTURE RALLIES 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6. (SBU) \"For the Development of Science\" held a 
meeting that filled a local movie theater February 25. 
With an audience that was roughly 90 percent male, 
students, professors, a former army colonel, and one 
parliamentarian spoke against the law, which one 
professor described as \"a genocide campaign against 
science.\"  Form letters to National Assembly members 
were awaiting rally participants\' signatures.  Erik 
Grigoryan, a Yerevan State University undergraduate 
student who has organized many of the campaign\'s 
events, told us that the group plans to flood the 
National Assembly with such letters.  The students 
announced that two future rallies were also planned for 
February 28 and March 1.  On March 1, the students plan 
to march through the city to the parliament building to 
stage the demonstration.  Grigoryan said that while the 
Mayor\'s Office had denied permits to stage the 
demonstrations, they would not be canceled.  He 
recognized that anyone participating could be 
administratively detained for demonstrating without a 
permit. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
STUDENTS USE MEDIA, WEB TO SPREAD MESSAGE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) In its second week, \"For the Development of 
Science\" has developed an impressive level of 
sophistication in their efforts.  The students are 
issuing daily press releases (in Armenian, Russian, and 
English) to all media outlets, providing information on 
the day\'s developments and announcing future events. 
The group also has a website (http://all- 
students.nm.ru), where they have posted all the press 
releases, a calendar of activities, and photos of 
demonstrations.  As shown by the recent rally, their 
techniques have been effective in turning out 
relatively large numbers of demonstrators at their 
scheduled events. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) The \"Law on Military Service\" has aroused 
student passion like no other recent issue, including 
the 2003 elections.  Though it is questionable that the 
students really seek to preserve \"scientific progress\" 
rather than their own draft deferments, they have 
quickly developed a campaign with a message backed by 
not-insignificant momentum.  The students\' growing 
number of supporters and effective use of the media to 
promote their message sharply contrasts with the 
parliamentary opposition\'s largely failed efforts to 
organize large anti-government protests.  Though the 
success of the students\' campaign remains to be seen, 
their efforts have managed to, at least for the moment, 
mobilize their previously apolitical and passive peers.

Accordingly. 
 
2. (SBU) Deputy Foreign Minister Ruben Shugarian 
demarched DCM February 26 regarding expected 
differences in FY 2005 military assistance levels for 
Azerbaijan and Armenia.  Shugarian delivered an eleven- 
point non-paper that called on the USG to reconsider 
the previously announced FMF assistance numbers.  He 
asserted that disparity of military assistance levels 
threatened GOAM\'s ability to maintain the current 
ceasefire with Azerbaijan.  The demarche pointed to 
\"increasingly belligerent\" statements made by 
Azerbaijani leaders as a result of increased USG 
military funding to Azerbaijan.  (Note:  The veiled 
reference presumably referred to comments made in the 
wake of the recent death of an Armenian soldier during 
a PFP training program in Budapest.  End Note.) 
 
3. (SBU) DCM responded by pointing out the global 
context in which the USG made decisions regarding FMF 
funds.  She highlighted USG priorities for fighting 
terrorism, maritime security and narcotics trafficking 
in the region and the relatively greater threats 
currently faced by Azerbaijan.  She said Azerbaijan\'s 
capacity to absorb higher levels of military funding 
also played a role in determining the FY 2005 level of 
funding.  She outlined the next steps in the budget 
request process and emphasized the role of the U.S. 
Congress. 
 
4. (SBU) Text of the non-paper follows: 
 
BEGIN TEXT 
--The Government of the Republic of Armenia is highly 
appreciative of the assistance provided by the United 
States of America to the people of Armenia through the 
years. 
--Through this assistance it has become possible to 
foster transition to a market economy, strengthen 
democratic institutions, and enforce protection of 
human rights. 
--Military assistance provided to Armenia in the last 
two years has been instrumental in enhancing the 
security of the country. 
--It was our strong belief that the US, as a co-chair 
of the Minsk Group and one of the main players in the 
Nagorno Karabagh dispute settlement, would act 
especially vigilantly not to jeopardize the fragile 
military balance presently existing in the region. 
--The military balance is the single most important 
guarantor of the existing self-monitored ceasefire. 
--The disparity between the levels of military 
assistance proposed for Armenia and Azerbaijan for FY 
2005 raises doubts about our assumption. 
--Increasingly hostile and belligerent statements from 
Azerbaijan are fueled by the belief that their military 
resources will indeed increase through various means. 
--Recent public statements by the Azerbaijani 
leadership clearly indicate that they are, at least in 
part, relying on a possible military venture in the 
future. 
--The Armenian government and the Armenian people 
relied on US assurances that a waiver of Section 907 
would not lead to a disparity in military assistance in 
the two countries. 
--The Government of Armenia is extremely concerned by 
the proposal of the US Administration and calls upon it 
to reconsider the decision, as well as to continue to 
act as an honest broker, and undertake all the 
necessary steps to ensure peace and stability in the 
region. 
--The Armenian government is prepared to discuss 
special projects that might fall within a broader 
security program, and useful in the war on terrorism. 
--Yerevan; February 27, 2004.

2. (SBU) Prime Minister Andranik Margarian announced 
February 26 that the government would formally withdraw 
from parliament the controversial \"Law on Military 
Service.\"  Margarian blamed other ministers for failing 
to explain the benefits of the law clearly, thereby

a victory rally February 27, pledging to remain united 
and vigilant against any government attempts to re-

PRIME MINISTER WITHDRAWS LAW 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Prime Minister Andranik Margarian withdrew the 
\"Law on Military Service\" from the National Assembly on 
February 26.  The announcement came a day after the 
student group \"For the Progress of Science\" pledged 
large demonstrations in the coming days to protest the 
law, which would remove draft deferments for graduate 
study.  Margarian faulted government ministers, in 
particular Education Minister Sergo Yeritsian, for 
failing to adequately explain the law \"in a timely or 
appropriate manner\", and build public support for its 
passage. 
 
------------------------ 
VICTORY RALLY DRAWS 2000 
------------------------ 
 
4. (U) The student group \"For the Development of 
Science\" turned an already-scheduled demonstration 
against the bill into a victory rally in downtown 
Yerevan February 27.  Approximately 2000 students heard 
group organizers praise their discipline and unity 
throughout the campaign, and issue calls for vigilance 
in case the government were to re-introduce the law. 
In an address to the crowd, one student praised his 
peer\'s \"complete unity, which led to our ultimate 
victory.\" 
 
5. (SBU) Several leaders of \"For the Development of 
Science\" told us at the rally that they were \"shocked\" 
the government had backed down so quickly (analysis of 
the campaign will be provided septel).  One student 
said that they had not yet delivered the thousands of 
signed form letters to parliamentarians.  The students 
were wary of the government\'s maneuvers, stating that 
perhaps the government would re-introduce the bill in 
the summer when students were on break.  They pledged 
to maintain their movement to monitor any developments.

DELAY WILL NOT BRING ANY BENEFIT. U.S. WILL DO

2.Oppositionist Armenian daily HAYKAKAN ZHAMANAK 
(02/28) wrote: \"Ambassador Ordway mentioned that the 
likelihood of a resumption of military action is very 
low and they (the U.S.) will do everything to make sure 
this does not happen.  Mr. Ordway assured several times 
during the press conference that they don\'t see 
preparations on either side for breaking the cease- 
fire.\"  \"As to the militaristic statements recently 
heard from Azerbaijan, the West, as it became clear 
from the US Ambassador\'s words, does not take them 
seriously.  According to John Ordway, if we study the 
situation over a period of several years, we can see 
that sometimes these threats and statements were made 
more frequently.  At the same time, Ambassador Ordway 
mentioned numerous times during the conference that 
such statements were made on both sides.\"  Commenting 
on Kocharian-Aliyev meetings the newspaper wrote: 
\"Ordway expressed hope that those meetings would 
continue in the future and would take place both as 
special meetings and within the framework of 
international events.  It can be concluded from this 
that there are no talks about concrete meetings.\"

predict what kind of impact this might have on the 
negotiation process.\"  \"At the same time the Ambassador 
does not think that Azerbaijan should be left out of 
further NATO programs because of the crime committed in 
Budapest.  It turned out that it is still `too early to 
draw conclusions as to the motives of this murder.\'  It 
is not new that politics implies double standards.  But 
at least in this case one does not have to be that 
duplicitous.\"

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  The axe-murder of Lieutenant Gurgen Markarian two 
weeks ago in Budapest continues to elicit strong emotions 
from Armenians.  The government held a state funeral for 
Margarian February 28, coinciding with the anniversary of the 
1988 Sumgait killings in Azerbaijan.  A Sumgait remembrance 
ceremony drew 150,000 Armenians, the largest number in over a 
decade.  In private meetings, Armenian diplomatic officials 
have expressed outrage over the killings, and expressed the 
opinion that the United States should do more to hold 
Azerbaijan accountable.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
BURIAL AND SUMGAIT REMEMBRANCE COINCIDE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The GOAM provided a full state funeral February 28 
for slain Lieutenant Gurgen Markarian, killed by an 
Azerbaijani officer at a NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) 
language program in Budapest.  Before the funeral, hundreds 
of Armenians viewed the body on display in the central 
Republic Square.  The funeral coincided with the sixteenth 
anniversary of the killing of Armenians in the Azerbaijani 
town of Sumgait, one event that precipitated the Karabakh 
war.  Roughly 150,000 Armenians, the largest number in over 
ten years, attended the annual ceremonies at the Genocide 
Memorial in remembrance of the Sumgait victims.  President 
Kocharian laid a wreath at the memorial, and told those in 
attendance, \"Our response to the Azeri bellicose rhetoric is 
as follows:  we did not fear it either in 1988 or 1992; nor 
do we fear it today.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
MFA OFFICIALS EXPRESS EMOTIONAL OUTRAGE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Lilit Tutkhalian, Head of the Americas\' Department at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quickly changed the focus of 
a routine meeting to deliver the annual Human Rights Report 
to Markarian\'s killing.  Tutkhalian noted that the body of 
the Armenian officer arrived in Armenia that morning and 
began crying.  Tutkhalian launched into an emotional tirade 
stating that \"personally and professionally\" she and her 
colleagues could now definitively say the Azerbaijanis were 
\"pure savages\" (Note.  Tutkhalian allegedly repeated the 
phrase verbatim to a visiting United States National 
Academies of Science delegation the next day.  End note.) 
She hoped that the murder finally proved to the United States 
that it was impossible to work with the Azerbaijani 
government, and that any compromise to the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict could not allow any Armenians to live under 
Azerbaijani rule.  Tutkhalian noted that the MFA was 
reviewing its plans to send Armenian delegations to any 
international conferences that included Azerbaijani 
participants, saying that her Deputy Minister expressed 
serious reservations about her own plans to travel to an 
upcoming meeting of the Black Sea Economic Forum. 
 
4. (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Tatul Margarian also used 
charged wording when discussing deteriorating relations with 
Azerbaijan with a delegation from the United States Air War 
College March 2.  Margarian said that new Azerbaijani 
President Ilham Aliyev had needlessly exacerbated bilateral 
tensions, and seemed entirely unwilling to even contemplate 
the necessary steps for a peaceful resolution of the Karabakh 
conflict.  Margarian told the delegation that if Aliyev 
thought by bringing Armenian-Azerbaijani relations to \"zero,\" 
he could \"use oil money over time to buy tanks\" for 
re-capturing Karabakh then \"he is wrong.\"  Margarian said 
that in meetings last week his Azerbaijani counterpart told 
him that the Azerbaijani officer arrested for the Budapest 
killing could not be faulted because he was a refugee forced 
to flee his home during the Karabakh conflict.  Noting the 
Azerbaijani claims of a large refugee population from the 
war, Margarian replied, \"How can we give back any territory 
if there are 500,000 axemen waiting to kill innocent 
Armenians?\" 
 
------------------------------- 
AZERBAIJAN \"NOT A NATO PARTNER\" 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Margarian said that the killing only highlighted 
Armenia\'s and Azerbaijan\'s different polices regarding 
cooperation with NATO.  Margarian noted that Armenia had made 
substantial progress in the past two years in its cooperation 
with the organization, highlighted by the signing of a PfP 
SOFA, the hosting of PfP military exercises in June 2003, and 
the recent deployment of peacekeepers to Kosovo.  He said 
that Azerbaijan had consistently refused to live up to its 
PfP obligations, as shown by the country\'s refusal to allow 
two Armenian officers to participate in the planning 
conference for Cooperative Best Effort 04 held in Baku. 
Margarian told the delegation that he hopes the United States 
\"takes a strong stance\" in light of the Azerbaijani behavior, 
but if not, \"you allow them to let NATO fail.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (C) The murder of the Armenian officer in Budapest, an 
event exacerbated by the brutality of the crime, continues to 
resonate with Armenians.  The rhetoric employed by Tutkhalian 
and Deputy Minister Margarian, two long-serving diplomats 
noted for their professionalism, highlights the strong 
emotions towards Azerbaijan exposed by the killing.  In 
addition, USG attempts to reserve judgment on the motivation 
for the crime and to avoid the appearance of taking sides in 
this conflict have been interpreted by government officials 
(and Armenian diasporans we have talked to) as tacit support 
for an Azerbaijani position they find unacceptable and 
infuriating.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Summary:  Armenia\'s proximity to countries hit 
hard by the HIV/AIDS epidemic (Russia, Georgia and 
Ukraine) raises concerns about its vulnerability and 
the actions the GOAM is taking to address the problem. 
Experts agree that, while there is a low incidence of 
HIV/AIDS in Armenia at present, it is important to 
increase efforts at awareness and education to counter 
the problem before it grows out of hand.  The USD 7.2 
million grant to Armenia from the UN Global Aids Fund 
(25 percent funded by the USG) has bolstered the 
international donor community\'s efforts in this field. 
The USG is offering technical assistance as the GOAM 
combines the country\'s main HIV/AIDS and sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) centers.  HIV/AIDS 
awareness and prevention campaigns will only be 
successful among Armenia\'s mostly conservative society 
if the GOAM supports awareness campaigns that 
aggressively address this traditionally taboo issue. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
HIV/AIDS INCIDENCE STILL RELATIVELY LOW 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Many in the international community jump to the 
conclusion that Armenia, like its neighbor Georgia, is 
suffering from an HIV/AIDS epidemic that reaches far 
into the population.  Although many experts believe 
that the GOAM continues to underestimate the problem 
(the GOAM reports there are only 252 registered cases 
of HIV/AIDS in the country), most experts agree that 
its scope is still relatively limited.  The UN 
categorizes Armenia as a \"basic\" country in terms of 
HIV/AIDS incidence.  This classification presumes that 
less than one percent of the total population carries 
the infection. 
 
4. (U) The relatively low degree of HIV/AIDS in Armenia 
is a bit of an anomaly given the aggressive spread of 
the disease in neighboring Russia, Georgia and other 
CIS countries.  Many point to Armenia\'s isolation 
during the early 1990s and early efforts aimed at 
awareness and prevention as reasons for the low level 
of infection.  Some Diaspora advocacy groups have 
expressed concern to us, however, that the increasing 
flows of migrants between Russia and Armenia (mostly as 
seasonal laborers) may eventually lead to increased 
rates of HIV/AIDS infection in Armenia. 
 
5. (U) Health experts believe that transmission of 
HIV/AIDS in Armenia takes place via heterosexual 
intercourse within high-risk populations.  Like many 
countries in the region, Armenia\'s high-risk population 
consists mainly of intravenous drug users, commercial 
sex workers, military personnel, migrant workers, and 
prison populations. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
GLOBAL FUND PROGRAMS AIM TO KEEP INCIDENCE LOW 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6. (U) The UN Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS allocated 
USD 7.2 Million to Armenia in 2003.  Experts report 
that this is a healthy sum for a country like Armenia 
and should fund a substantial program with national 
reach.  These monies will be used for education, 
awareness and prevention programs.  In addition, 
programs for voluntary testing and counseling centers 
will open throughout the country.  These centers will 
work through a network of local NGOS.  USAID is working 
with the primary recipient, World Vision, to facilitate 
the program.  According to information from the 
Ministry of Health, the GOAM will likely not apply to 
the Global Fund for AIDS-related programs in FY \'05 but 
will instead apply for Tuberculosis (TB) funding. 
 
------------------------------ 
GOAM MERGING AIDS, STI EFFORTS 
------------------------------ 
 
7. (U) Beyond the specific question of HIV/AIDS, 
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) remain a serious 
problem in Armenia.  Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Syphilis and 
other infections spread more rapidly among the Armenian 
population, but have received less attention from the 
global community.  While GOAM resources to confront the 
spread of STIs remain limited, donor community programs 
(including USG assistance efforts) are working to curb 
this problem. 
 
8. (U) The GOAM recently merged the Armenian National 
STI Center and the Armenian HIV/AIDS Center into one 
management unit.  The former director of the STI center 
will now serve as the director of the new combined 
entity.  This move has bureaucratic implications that 
could affect its ability to apply for and administer 
future funding.  USAID is monitoring the situation 
carefully to facilitate a smooth merger that won\'t 
damage ongoing projects. 
 
-------- 
COMMENT 
-------- 
 
9. (SBU) As in many places, the HIV/AIDS issue hits 
sensitive nerves in Armenia\'s traditionally 
conservative society.  While there is political will 
from the high-levels of the GOAM and within the 
healthcare community to address the issue, the real 
work of education, awareness and prevention lies with 
the everyday population.  High expectations about the 
much-touted Armenecum treatment for HIV/AIDS (developed 
by Armenian scientists) appears to have waned in recent 
months, leaving Armenia to face the more mundane but 
dangerous reality of keeping the epidemic under control 
and treating those already infected by the disease. 
The GOAM will have to support donor community efforts 
to create buy-in among the population if prevention 
efforts are to succeed.

SUBJECT: TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS IN ARMENIA: THE VIEW FROM 
THE PROCURATOR\'S OFFICE 
 
REF: YEREVAN 171 
 
Classified By: DCM WALKER FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (C) Through an Advisor to the Minister of Justice, we 
have obtained a copy of a report on trafficking in perons 
(TIP) in Armenia prepared by the Office of the Procurator 
General.  The detail and scope of the report\'s findings, 
along with recent Embassy demarches on Armenia\'s shaky Tier 
II status, should prompt the GOAM to take more decisive 
ownership of the TIP problem.  The report also reveals local 
law enforcement\'s surprisingly proactive and productive 
efforts in the fight against TIP.  Details of the report to 
the Minister of Justice follow. 
 
 
Trafficking in Persons from Armenia 
 
 
2.  (C) Law enforcement has identified the U.A.E. as the 
primary country of destination for Armenian victims of 
trafficking.  As a result, law enforcement has focused its 
efforts on trafficking rings working out of Dubai and has 
stepped up efforts in the cities of Yerevan, Vanadzor and 
Kapan as well as in Syunik Marz (region)-- the major points 
of origin for trafficked victims in Armenia. 
 
3.  (C) The report indicates that because securing visas for 
unmarried women under 30 for the U.A.E. is difficult, ring 
leaders often use stolen passports or false marriages to 
facilitate entry to the U.A.E.  Traffickers arrange travel 
for groups of women to the U.A.E. at their (traffickers\') 
expense.  Upon arrival in Dubai, the women are expected to 
generate USD 6,000 to 10,000 to repay their debt; subsequent 
revenue is later to be split 50/50.  Once in Dubai, the 
women\'s passports are collected and their movements 
controlled.  Armenian Prosecutors believe that trafficking 
rings are creating pyramids, whereby initially recruited 
women begin recruiting for the ring in exchange for being 
relieved of the obligation to split proceeds 50/50 with the 
ringleaders.  The Armenian Prosecutor alleges that 
traffickers tell women returning to Armenia that they will 
likely be \"shaken down\" by airport officials and that their 
earnings will therefore be transferred to them in Armenia via 
Western Union.  Very often funds are never transferred. 
 
4. (C) Currently, there are two suspects in custody in 
Armenia who are believed to be involved in trafficking women 
to Dubai.  The Office of the Procurator General (OPG) has 
amassed extensive information on suspected victims, their 
aliases and false passport information; ringleaders have also 
been identified.  OPG has forwarded information about the 
traffickers to their counterparts in Dubai with a request 
that the suspected ringleaders be detained.  OPG is 
optimistic that the leader of this trafficking ring will be 
arrested and returned to Armenia; however, Dubai officials 
have not yet acted on this request. 
 
5. (C) The report further indicates that Dubai authorities 
have requested that Armenian law enforcement travel to Dubai 
to collaborate on the case.  The Interagency Commission to 
Address Issues Related to Human Trafficking indicated that 
plans to travel to Dubai were postponed because information 
regarding the trip was reportedly leaked; however, law 
enforcement officials are hopeful that they will be able to 
travel to Dubai soonest. 
 
6.  (C) Concern in Armenia over trafficking of Armenians to 
Turkey is increasing.  A local NGO that has been providing 
assistance to victims of trafficking in Armenia since 
December 2003 reports that it has assisted a man who was 
trafficked to Turkey via Georgia to be exploited for 
construction work in Istanbul.  The victim was able to return 
with the help of the Russian Consulate in Istanbul and 
reported to the NGO that he is aware of other victims still 
in Turkey.  Furthermore, an ongoing Armenian law enforcement 
investigation has uncovered a trafficking ring working in 
Turkey.  The Office of the Procurator 
General anticipates arrests in the very near future. 
 
 
Trafficking in Persons through Armenia 
 
 
7.  (C) Since 2002, Armenian law enforcement officials have 
been investigating at least one trafficking ring operating 
between Central Asia and the U.A.E. via the Caucasus.  Prior 
to the cancellation in March 2003 of the Tashkent-Yerevan 
flight, women reportedly were brought from Uzbekistan to 
Armenia and then sent on to Dubai.  Following the 
cancellation of the flight, the route has changed: Uzbek 
women are allegedly transported to Georgia, cross the land 
border into Armenia and then sent on to Dubai.  (NOTE: There 
is a direct Yerevan-Dubai flight operated by the local 
airline.  END NOTE.) 
 
8.  (C) OPG believes that trafficking rings operating out of 
Central Asia are comprised of Armenians with Uzbek 
citizenship and Armenians with Georgian citizenship.  The 
ring\'s activities are allegedly supported by extended family 
that provide transport, housing, etc. in return for 
compensation.  One prosecutor has indicated that the ring\'s 
activities may extend even farther-- at least one of the 
Uzbek victims has traveled to Southeast Asia, the U.A.E. and 
most recently Armenia.  The Prosecutor\'s office believes that 
the ring also maintains a travel business (name not 
disclosed) in Georgia, which organizes theft of Georgian 
passports for use by the women. 
 
9.  (C) Recently, 8 Uzbek women were freed from their 
traffickers by law enforcement and referred to a local NGO in 
Yerevan for safehaven and assistance (reftel).  Three alleged 
traffickers-- Armenians with Uzbek citizenship, are in 
custody and an investigation is ongoing.  Relatives of the 
traffickers believed to be still located in Uzbekistan 
recruited the 8 women separately; the women traveled to 
Yerevan on their own passports via Moscow.  OPG reports that 
the traffickers intended to send the women to Dubai after 
obtaining fraudulent travel documents in Armenia.  OPG 
believes that intense law enforcement efforts impeded the 
trafficker\'s ability to obtain false passports for the 8 
women and plans to travel to Dubai were cancelled.  The women 
and OPG reported that the traffickers set them up to work as 
elite prostitutes in high-end saunas and small hotels in 
Armenia and began, what turned out for the traffickers to be, 
a booming business in Yerevan. 
 
10.  (C) Comment:  The Advisor to the Minister of Justice, 
who has excellent contacts throughout the GOAM, has 
effectively raised concerns about Armenia\'s TIP record with 
the Foreign Minister, Justice Minister and Presidency. His 
discussions with the Office of the Procurator General 
indicate (and the report confirms) that at the law 
enforcement level, TIP is being taken very seriously.  In the 
months to come, we will be watching to see whether the higher 
levels of the GOAM are prepared to take full, public 
ownership of this problem.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (S) There is an Armenian-Kurdish friendship society in 
downtown Yerevan with a sign posted on the door identifying 
it as such.  The \"Friendship Society\'s\" main goals in Armenia 
appear to be to promote Kurdish culture, organize holidays, 
demonstrations, and campaigns for better treatment of and/or 
freedom for Ocalan, as opposed to promoting a specific 
anti-Turkish propoganda campaign.  The office, however, 
openly admitted to us that it represents the Kurdish People\'s 
Congress (also now known as Kongra Gel).  There is no 
evidence that Kongra-Gel has either the interest or the 
ability to fundraise in Armenia. Active recruitment drives, 
or the establishment of any type of Kurdish military camps in 
Armenia would be extremly difficult to conduct and hide in a 
country that is 97 percent ethnically Armenian.  Kurds 
currently constitute a small minority of approximately 
40,000, most of whom work as nomadic cattle and goat farmers 
and live near the poverty level.   Approximately 500 Armenian 
Kurds held a peaceful demonstration in downtown Yerevan on 
February 15 to mark the fifth anniversary of Ocalan\'s arrest. 
 End Summary. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
KURDISH POPULATION IN ARMENIA 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (S) According to Knyaz Hasanov, the Kurdish representative 
to the executive office of the President of Armenia, 
approximately 40,000 Kurds live in Armenia (down from an 
estimated 60,000 in 1989).  Many Kurds emigrated either to 
Azerbaijan (because of the Nagorno Karabakh war, Hasanov told 
us) or to Russia for economic reasons.  The majority of 
Armenian Kurds live in or near Talin, Ashtarak, Aragats, 
Aparan and Odketenbuan.  Most work in cattle or goat 
husbandry and have been hard hit by the economic crisis that 
affects Armenia\'s rural sector.  Hasanov noted that in 
Armenia there were no successful Kurdish businessmen, Kurdish 
restaurants, Kurdish supermarkets or even a Kurdish library. 
 
 
3. (S) Hasanov commented that the majority of Kurds in 
Armenia are Yezidis, or Christians.  While some members of 
the Yezidi community liked to differentiate themselves from 
the Muslim Kurds, Hasanov said, he felt that ethnicity, 
history, and language bonded all Kurds in Armenia together 
with no visible religious friction.  Hasanov felt that the 
Kurdish population as a whole had a good relationship with 
the Armenian government.  Hasanov did not feel that Kurds 
suffered discrimination on a personal or official level and, 
while the Armenian government did not always respond to their 
requests for funding for cultural events, it would usually at 
least listen to them. (COMMENT:  In our experience, the local 
Yezidis vigorously differentiate themselves from Kurds, 
regardless of the obvious connections.  Moreover, the 
indigeneous Yezidis and Kurds are quite split.  A proposed 
USDA project to engage them in livestock-related projects 
faces substantial challenges due to their inability, at least 
initially, to agree among themselves on how to organize.  END 
COMMENT) 
 
4. (S) Hasanov introduced us to prominent Armenian/Kurds 
including the chairman of the Kurdish writers association, 
the head of a Kurdish radio program (which broadcasts for 30 
minutes a day), the deputy head of the Armenian-Kurdish 
Friendship society, a professor of Kurdish language, an 
engineer, a government bureaucrat and the Armenian head of 
the local \"Friendship Society.\"  All of the prominent 
Armenian/Kurds told us that they were desperately 
underfunded, and were able to only sporadically publish three 
Kurdish language newspapers, unable to fund Kurdish cultural 
events, and wanted more than the government-allotted 30 
minutes of daily Kurdish radio time.  All claimed that they 
had very few contacts with prominent Kurds abroad and that 
they were unable to successfully solicit funds for their 
cultural projects.  While most agreed that the Armenian 
government could do more for them as a minority group, none 
felt that they faced rampant discrimination on a personal or 
government level and realized that their economic situation 
does not differ substantially from Armenians as a whole.

KURDISH PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS IN YEREVAN 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (S) Cherkeze Erash, the administrative head of the office, 
explained to us that the KPC established its office in 
Yerevan in 1994 and while the KPC sent representatives from 
time to time to Armenia, Erash was the long-term 
representative.  (NOTE:  He openly admitted to us the 
connection with KPC.  END NOTE.)  Presently, he told us, the 
KPC had two activists who arrived from Turkey, Heydar Ali and 
Gazim Seyit, who arrived in January 2004 and were planning to 
stay until May.  The office is a Soviet-style three-bedroom 
apartment located in the center of town, with modest 
furnishings and multiple posters and banners depicting Ocalan 
and other prominent Kurdish heroes and \"martyrs.\"  Erash 
explained to us that they had three full-time employees and 
approximately 22 Armenian Kurds who live in villages outside 
of Yerevan and work for the office part-time.  We noticed one 
part-time driver with an older Russian vehicle.  Erash worked 
as a professor at a local university to supplement his 
income. 
 
6. (S) Erash told us that they usually receive 2-3 KPC 
visitors at a time from Iran, Syria, Europe, Iraq and Russia, 
who usually stay for one to four months.  He said that in 
2003 the Armenia office had approximately 15 such visitors. 
Erash stated that the visitors come to Armenia for the 
purpose of monitoring the local Kurdish population, give 
seminars on the Kurdish situation in northern Iraq, and help 
with Kurdish language and cultural instruction in the 
villages.  Erash described his own job as a coordinator and 
organizer of Kurdish holidays, demonstrations and overseas 
visitors.  He stated his next assignment was to organize the 
upcoming Novruz holiday in March, and coordinate the travel 
of famous Kurdish speakers and/or musicians from Europe to 
Yerevan for the holiday.  When asked about KPC\'s relationship 
with the Armenian government, Erash told us that he had good 
contacts in most government ministries and the Armenian 
government did not restrict KPC\'s movement or interfere with 
their office in any significant way. 
 
7. (S) When we asked about KPC\'s finances, Erash commented 
that the local Kurdish population was very poor, and KPC was 
not able to raise funds in the poor village areas.  Erash 
stated that money for the KPC\'s office rent came from 
Russian-Kurdish businessmen, whom he did not name, and/or 
occasional gifts from European Kurds.  Erash lamented that 
they did not pay salaries at the KPC office, but money from 
various Diaspora Kurds did defray some living expenses of the 
key KPC office employees (including Erash himself).  Erash 
stated that KPC visitors and Kurdish entertainers from 
overseas generally paid their own way and often lived with 
local Kurds as a way of reducing expenses.  Erash told us 
that the KPC avoids using the local banking system and money 
was often hand-carried by couriers or by businessmen 
themselves when they came to visit Yerevan. 
 
8. (S) Rzgan Lezgiyan, a local Kurdish language professor, 
agreed that the KPC was probably unable to raise much money 
in Armenia, but criticized the fact that the KPC spent what 
little money it had to transport village Kurds to Yerevan for 
pro-Ocalan rallies instead of creating social welfare 
programs.  Lezgiyan stated that most educated Yerevan Kurds 
did not interact with the KPC office in Yerevan because of 
its strict pro-Ocalan propaganda.  Lezgiyan remembered that 
in 2002 the KPC office had sponsored five Kurdish students to 
take Kurdish language courses but suspended the funding when 
the students failed to show at a KPC organized pro-Ocalan 
rally.  Lezgiyan believed that the KPC office was most 
influential five years ago when Ocalan was first captured and 
they were able to attract several thousand people to downtown 
Yerevan for a pro-Ocalan rally.  Since then there had been a 
noticeable decline in numbers of attendees at pro-Ocalan 
rallies, which were now only numbering in the low hundreds. 
The most recent such rally was held February 15, and 
attracted about 500 participants. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
NEW DIRECTION FOR THE KURDISH PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
9. (S) Ali explained to us that his job in Armenia was to 
travel to the villages and educate Kurds on the new direction 
of the KPC which was focused on human rights, democracy and 
freedom.  Ali stated that guarantees of freedom were more 
important than statehood and as long as Ocalan was in good 
health they would pursue a strategy of peaceful negotiations 
with Turkey.  He then amended his comments by stating that if 
Ocalan\'s health worsened or died in captivity then the KPC 
might have to revise its strategy.  He explained that the 
Caucasus, Central Asia and eastern Europe were in his sphere 
of responsibility and he traveled throughout this region 
often.  In Armenia his job was to give seminars to Kurds 
about news from Northern Iraq and to spread the message of 
the new KPC policy.  He also stated he acted as a facilitator 
for Kurdish businessmen and looked for investment 
opportunities, but lamented he did not see many in Armenia. 
Lezgiyan told us that when he met Ali he noted that the KPC 
had dropped their demands for an independent Kurdistan and 
also downplayed the fact that Ocalan was their supreme leader 
in their propaganda.  Lezgiyan speculated that this was done 
because of pressure from the American government. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
KURDISH PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS DENIALS OF WRONGDOING IN ARMENIA 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
10. (S) Erash, Ali, Hasanov and Lezgiyan all strongly denied 
that there were any camps of Kurdish fighters in Armenia. 
All stated that it would be impossible to hide a military 
training camp in Armenian villages where the population was 
97 percent Armenian and any large group of strange Kurds 
would be immediately noticed by the local authorities.  Ali 
stated that it would also be logistically much easier to 
transport fighters from Turkey to northern Iraq, where they 
would be safe, receive good medical treatment and have the 
infrastructure to support them, rather than trying to hide 
them in Armenia.  Ali and Erash also commented that the 
Kurdish population has a good relationship with the Armenian 
government, which they would be loathe to jeopardize.  (NOTE: 
 In 1999 there was a meeting between the Armenian National 
Security Service (NSS) and Turkish Intelligence which 
resulted in meetings and exchange of information.  We were 
told recently by the NSS that this meeting focused primarily 
on the issue of training camps, and included field visits to 
sites suspected by the Turkish side of such activity.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
11. (S) Erash and Ali both also strongly denied that there 
was any drug trafficking by Armenian Kurds and stated 
repeatedly that this type of behavior is not tolerated in 
Kurdish culture.  Erash claimed that everyone knew everyone 
in the Armenian Kurdish community, and if Kurdish elders 
found out about any such activity the offending parties would 
be immediately expelled from Armenian Kurdish society. 
 
12. (S) Erash, Ali, Hasnaov, and the educated Yerevan Kurds 
were all in agreement in telling us that due to the poor 
economic situation in Armenian there was little or no 
possibility of KPC doing any type of fundraising in Armenia 
and that the Armenian KPC office relied heavily on donations 
from Diaspora Kurds to keep their office running, publish 
their newspapers and help defray living expenses for key 
employees. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (S) Through post\'s observations as well as through other 
contacts it appears that the local KPC\'s office\'s main goal 
is to spread pro-Ocalan propaganda.  Due to the very poor 
economic conditions of most Armenians, and especially that of 
the Kurdish population, it would be difficult for KPC to 
raise any significant funds in Armenia.  Armenia\'s 
overwhelmingly ethnically Armenian population makes it 
equally difficult for the KPC to set up any type of armed 
camps, or recruiting drives in the Armenian countryside 
without attracting local authorities\' notice.  To the best of 
post\'s knowledge, the local KPC office does not appear to be 
actively engaged in supporting terrorist activities from 
Armenia.  The office\'s official registration as a \"Friendship 
Society\" also serves to obscure any actionable connection to 
the terrorist KPC.  The NSS claims to be closely monitoring 
the activities of the office and has stated that they would 
immediately arrest and/or deport any member of the KPC office 
found to be conducting illegal activities. 
 
14.  (S)  There are, however, two vulnerable points that 
might be exploited to disrupt, if not actually shut down, 
this operation: 
 
--  To the extent that we can reliably identify to the GOAM 
the KPC visitors as members of Kongra Gel, which is on the 
U.S. terrorist list, we can encourage the GOAM to expel them 
or prevent their entry into the country. 
 
--  The \"cash-by-courier\" funding mechanism is another 
vulnerable point, if we can proivde the GOAM information that 
shows the funding source is Kongra Gel.

SUBJECT:  USATF MID-TERM REVIEW FOCUSES ON CUSTOMS, 
TAXATION ISSUES 
 
1. (U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please treat 
accordingly. 
 
2. (SBU) The March 1 meeting of the U.S.-Armenia Task 
Force on Economic Cooperation (USATF) mid-term review 
focused on issues related to corruption, U.S. technical 
assistance in the private sector, improving customs 
procedures, trafficking in persons and INL-related 
issues.  Frank discussion of GOAM misgivings over 
aspects of the USG energy efficiency assistance ended 
with an agreement to establish a working group to 
address specific concerns.  Both parties tentatively 
agreed to hold the next USATF meeting in Armenia on or 
about May 18-19 to accommodate the schedules of 
Washington visitors from EUR/ACE.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
USATF ON CORRUPTION, SME DEVELOPMENT, BUSINESS CLIMATE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3. (SBU) Ambassador Ordway co-chaired the March 1 USATF 
mid-term review meeting with GOAM Minister of Finance 
and Economy Vartan Khachatryan.  The two sides signed 
the final version of the USATF Action Plan from the 
November 2003 meeting of the USATF in Washington, D.C. 
(see paragraph 13 for full text).  The Ambassador 
previewed overall USG comments on the GOAM\'s recently 
unveiled anti-corruption (A-C) strategy and 
accompanying action plan and informed the GOAM that USG 
representatives (including USAID and State) would 
provide these comments to GOAM officials for future 
discussion.  He also mentioned the compilation of a USG 
inventory of ongoing USG technical assistance related 
to A-C.  Minister Khachatryan agreed to consider the 
USG comments and integrate them into future A-C 
programming (USATF Action Plan Item 5). 
 
4. (SBU) Following an in-depth discussion of USAID and 
USDA technical assistance for small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs), Minister Khachatryan called on the 
USG to continue its program of establishing credit 
clubs that benefit SMEs in rural areas.  Minister 
Khachatryan complained about a perceived lack of 
coordination with the EBRD regarding Armenia\'s economic 
needs.  USAID responded that it had met recently with 
EBRD officials regarding deepening the organization\'s 
programs in Armenia.  The Ambassador outlined EBRD 
plans for a permanent expatriate representative in 
Armenia and predicted better collaboration once the 
EBRD re-established a full-scale Yerevan office (USATF 
Action Plan Item 6). 
 
5. (SBU) USAID informed the USATF that it was in 
contract negotiations with the American Chamber of 
Commerce in Armenia to conduct the planned Business 
Climate Review.  The GOAM requested that the USG share 
the terms of reference for the study with the Ministry 
of Finance and Economy.  Both sides discussed ways to 
ensure that the study would complement ongoing studies 
and reports sponsored by the World Bank (USATF Action 
Plan Item 7). 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
SENSITIVITIES OVER ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) A review of pending customs cases revealed 
misperceptions and reservations by the GOAM regarding 
some of USAID\'s ongoing energy efficiency programs. 
Minister Khachatryan said the GOAM was wary of a 
specific heating and cooling initiative that appeared 
to benefit wealthy Armenians instead of Armenia\'s 
poorest communities.  He said that the GOAM was holding 
equipment related to this program at the border until 
the USG provided further information about the design 
of the program and its beneficiaries.  Ambassador 
Ordway condemned this practice as damaging to our 
bilateral assistance relationship and called on the 
GOAM to release commodities immediately.  The two sides 
agreed to a working group meeting to further educate 
the Ministries of Energy and Finance and Economy about 
USAID\'s energy efficiency programs in order to avoid 
similar problems in the future (USATF Action Plan Item 
11). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
CUSTOMS PROCEDURES AND TAXATION OF USG ASSISTANCE 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
7. (SBU) The USG detailed other cases of commodities 
that the GOAM was holding at the port of entry pending 
customs clearance.  Ambassador Ordway reminded the GOAM 
of USG legislation forbidding the taxation of USG 
assistance and ongoing USG efforts to secure buy-in 
from GOAM stakeholders including relevant ministries 
and government offices to avoid such delays.  Both 
sides acknowledged new procedures agreed to during the 
November USATF meeting and agreed to consult with 
government counterparts in the event of discrepancies. 
The USG reviewed the mostly positive (preliminary) 
results from Embassy Yerevan of the 2003 \"Section 579\" 
report on taxation of government assistance. 
Ambassador Ordway called on the MFE to look for ways to 
expedite reimbursement of VAT paid by implementing 
offices or USG offices (USATF Action Plan Items 22 and 
23). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
FORENSIC LABORATORY, MONEY LAUNDERING, RULE OF LAW 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8. (SBU) Following discussion among GOAM 
representatives over which ministry should have 
technical oversight of the INL-sponsored Forensic Lab 
Project, the GOAM suggested the organization of a new 
internal task force to address the issue.  DCM and INL 
representative Ed Schack agreed to meet with the 
interministerial group in late March to monitor 
progress on this issue (USATF Action Plan Items 13 and 
14). 
 
9. (SBU) The GOAM agreed to provide copies of two 
recent anti-money laundering draft laws to the Embassy 
within the month.  The USG will translate the laws into 
English and provide them to INL anti-money laundering 
experts in Washington for comment (USATF Action Plan 
Item 16).  The Ambassador discussed the status of USG 
assistance in the judicial sector.  He reported that 
USAID was considering reinstating programs in this 
sector that could include a national code of ethics and 
technical assistance in case management (USATF Action 
Plan Item 16). 
 
---------------------- 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
---------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) DCM expressed USG disappointment in the 
inadequate GOAM anti-trafficking efforts over the past 
year and warned the GOAM of the risk of classification 
as a Tier 3 country in the Department\'s Trafficking in 
Persons Report.  The USG called on the GOAM to take 
greater ownership of the issue in order to avoid 
possible negative consequences that could include 
sanctions. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. (SBU) The four months following the last USATF 
meeting did not leave sufficient time for 
implementation of Action Plan items.  The mid-term 
review had the effect, however, of reminding GOAM 
ministries of their November 2003 commitments and 
encouraging dialogue with USG counterparts to produce 
measurable results before the next USATF meeting in 
late May.  Minister Khachatryan appears increasingly 
comfortable in his role as USATF facilitator and 
moderator among counterparts in other ministries.  We 
should capitalize on this dynamic by crafting a 
succinct, more action-oriented Action Plan during the 
next USATF meeting that will clearly define required 
actions and allow Minister Khachatryan to more 
effectively hold his colleagues to their end of USATF 
agreements.  Despite tensions over customs issues, the 
USATF mechanism continues to prove its worth as our 
principal forum for dialogue on bilateral assistance 
issues. 
 
12. (U) Point of contact is Embassy Assistance 
Coordinator Aaron Sherinian (SherinianAH@state.gov). 
Additional copies of the Action Plan and supporting 
briefing memos from the mid-term review have been sent 
to the Department (EUR/CACEN and EUR/ACE). 
 
------------------------------- 
FINAL TEXT OF USATF ACTION PLAN 
------------------------------- 
 
13. (U) The final text of the USATF Action Plan (as 
signed by Ambassador Ordway and Minister Khachatryan) 
follows.  Begin text: 
 
-- Action Plan 
-- U.S.-Armenia Economic Task Force 
-- November 4-5, 2003 
 
(1) The U.S. Government recognizes the linkages between 
the newly adopted Poverty Reduction Strategy, anti- 
corruption, and economic development, and congratulates 
the Government of Armenia in finalizing its PRSP in 
August 2003.  The U.S. Government will coordinate with 
the Government of Armenia as we develop our monitoring 
plan to ensure that it can also measure contributions 
to PRSP goals. 
 
(2) The U.S Government supports the concepts in the 
PRSP on targeting social payments, creating jobs, and 
investing in education and health.  Both sides also 
recognize that it is critical to increase savings in 
the economy and allowing for the creation of basic 
conditions for increased investment. 
 
(3) The U.S. Government recognizes and applauds 
Armenia\'s strong macroeconomic performance in the past 
few years.  However, both sides agree on the importance 
of increasing revenue as a share of GDP and that 
closing the fiscal deficit is critical for further 
growth.  The Government of Armenia is working on a 
strategy to increase revenue, and the U.S. Government 
will explore new mechanisms for working with the 
Government of Armenia and the National Assembly to 
support this strategy. 
 
(4) The Government of Armenia will provide the U.S. 
Government with a copy of the Strategy for Sustainable 
Economic Development as soon as it is available.  The 
U.S. Government, in coordination with other donors, 
will then work to complement the efforts of the 
Government of Armenia to achieve the stated priorities 
in this Strategy. 
 
(5) The Government of Armenia will provide the U.S. 
Government with a copy of the latest draft Anti- 
Corruption Strategy as soon as it is available, 
anticipated to be November 2003.  Although there was no 
U.S. Government input into the final draft that was 
approved on November 6, 2003, the U.S. Government, in 
coordination with other donors, will consider how it 
can best contribute to achieving the goals of the Anti- 
Corruption Strategy. 
 
(6) The U.S. Government recognizes Armenia\'s progress 
on enterprise development, especially in the 
development of SMEs and the accompanying creation of 
over 10,000 jobs.  Both sides agree that continued SME 
development and bringing them into the formal economy 
is critical to the creation of jobs and alleviation of 
poverty in Armenia.  The U.S. Government, through USAID 
and USDA programs, will continue to provide assistance 
to entrepreneurs and micro and SME lending facilities, 
and - noting the Government of Armenia\'s interest in 
this program - will work with the EBRD to support SME 
development in Armenia. 
 
(7) The U.S. Government will consult with the 
Government of Armenia, representatives of the Diaspora 
and other donors, including the World Bank, in 
sponsoring the design and implementation of a \"Business 
Climate Review\" that will evaluate constraints to 
foreign direct investment in Armenia.  Upon completion 
of any survey undertaken in this regard, the U.S. 
Government will provide its results to the Government 
of Armenia, the High Business Council, the local 
business community and Diaspora representatives. 
 
(8) The sides recognize the need to increase the level 
of financial intermediation in the economy.  They also 
recognize that a major impediment to increased 
intermediation is the high level of \"connected lending\" 
in the Armenian economy.  The U.S. Government will work 
with the Central Bank of Armenia to look for ways to 
strengthen the banking sector and the availability of 
long term credit, with the objective of increasing the 
provision of credit to SMEs, while addressing risk 
issues. 
 
(9) The U.S. Government has reviewed the Government of 
Armenia\'s request to the U.S. Government to transfer 
repayments related to Armenia\'s concessional Pl 480 
debt to Assistance Program budgets in Armenia.  The 
U.S. Government, due to legal constraints, cannot 
respond positively to this request.  No further actions 
are expected on this issue. 
 
(10) Both sides recognize that, based on per capita 
income, Armenia could be eligible for funding under the 
Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), once the U.S. 
Congress passes the necessary legislation.  The U.S. 
Government notes its desire to begin the MCA process as 
soon as possible and the Government of Armenia 
expresses its intent to strengthen its qualifications 
for, and prepare for possible participation in MCA. 
 
(11) The U.S. Government recognizes the progress that 
Armenia has made on restructuring and privatizing its 
power sector, and will continue to work with the 
Government of Armenia to help it develop an energy 
strategy with concrete targets that provides safe, 
stable, and reliable energy to the Armenian people. 
The U.S. Government will also work with the Government 
of Armenia to develop heating alternatives and energy 
efficiency.  The U.S. Department of Energy agrees to 
work with the Ministries of Energy and Foreign Affairs 
to organize an energy conference to discuss energy 
policy and investment in the energy sector. 
 
(12) The U.S. Government agrees to continue to provide 
technical assistance to the Natural Monopolies 
Regulatory Commission.  In particular, U.S. assistance 
will focus on ways to help it perform effectively in 
its expanded role as the Public Utilities Regulatory 
Commission. 
 
(13) The U.S. Department of State will provide the 
Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry of 
Justice, and the already-established Armenian 
interagency task force with detailed plans and 
requirements for the development of a Forensics 
Laboratory in Armenia.  The Government of Armenia will 
work to expedite execution of the amended Letter of 
Agreement with the U.S. Government, which allows for 
additional law enforcement assistance. 
 
(14) Both sides recognize that money laundering, while 
not an obviously identified problem in Armenia today, 
could become a problem in the future, especially if the 
number of bank transactions increases as anticipated. 
The U.S. Government encourages the Government of 
Armenia to prepare internationally acceptable 
legislation and implementation plans to address this 
issue now, and the U.S. Government, through the 
Treasury Department, will provide technical assistance 
as requested by the Government of Armenia. 
 
(15) A representative from the U.S. Embassy will meet 
with Ministry of Foreign Affairs representative to 
review the status of Armenia\'s ratification of 
international counterterrorism conventions.  The U.S. 
Government will consider providing technical assistance 
in this area if requested by the Government of Armenia. 
 
(16) Both sides agree that weaknesses in rule of law 
and due process are impediments to economic growth, 
democratic development, and poverty reduction in 
Armenia.  The Government of Armenia commits to 
strengthening the rule of law and due process, and 
welcomes U.S. Government assistance toward this end. 
Both sides will work together to address and improve 
these issues. 
 
(17) The U.S. Government recognizes the positive 
progress made by the Government of Armenia in the area 
of trafficking in persons, as evidenced by Armenia\'s 
improved ranking in the U.S. State Department\'s most 
recent Trafficking in Persons Report.  The Government 
of Armenia and the U.S. State Department will continue 
to cooperate on developing and implementing programs to 
combat trafficking in persons. 
 
(18) Prior to the next meeting of the U.S.-Armenia Task 
Force, the Government of Armenia will seek ways to 
coordinate international assistance through the PRSP 
mechanism that will advance national development, 
economic reform, and cooperation.  Noting the PRSP as a 
current priority for the GOAM, these coordination 
efforts will harmonize the PRSP, national anti- 
corruption plan and other proposed strategies for 
economic development. 
 
(19) Both sides support the removal of Armenia from 
Jackson-Vanik as quickly as possible to reflect the 
progress made on both religious freedom and trade 
issues.  The U.S. State Department will provide the 
Government of Armenia with a paper on the U.S. 
Administration\'s position on removal of Armenia from 
the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. 
Ambassador Ordway will hold a press conference in 
Yerevan to explain Jackson-Vanik and the status of 
trade relations between the U.S. and Armenia. 
 
(20) The Government of Armenia will provide the U.S. 
Embassy with a compendium of WTO compliance issues. 
Upon receipt, the U.S. Government, in cooperation with 
other donors, will evaluate concrete assistance 
possibilities.  Both sides recognize that enforcement 
of intellectual property rights is important.  The U.S. 
Government is committed to providing technical 
assistance on IPR issues and will discuss with the GOAM 
possible technical assistance in other areas. 
 
(21) The Government of Armenia agrees that use of any 
type of minimum value reference pricing violates its 
WTO commitments.  The Government of Armenia will 
provide a written statement to the U.S. Embassy stating 
unequivocally that no computerized minimum value 
reference pricing system is in place in Armenia.  The 
U.S. Government agrees to consider providing technical 
and other assistance to the relevant Armenian agencies 
to help address import valuations. 
 
(22) Both sides acknowledge that problems existed when 
importing technical assistance and humanitarian 
commodities into Armenia under the Bilateral Agreement 
of 1992.  Both sides agree that the following procedure 
will be followed whenever the U.S. Government and other 
covered parties want to import commodities under this 
Bilateral Agreement in order to make this process more 
effective: 
 
--Every six months, the U.S. Embassy will submit to the 
State Customs Committee, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance and Economy an 
updated list of organizations covered by the Bilateral 
Agreement, with reference to specific projects that are 
separately and periodically provided to the Ministry of 
Finance and Economy for its assistance database. 
The U.S.  Embassy will designate a person who will walk 
through these steps to check the accuracy of the above 
mentioned database being kept by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the lists submitted to the Ministry 
to be sure the above system is effective.  When the 
interim review is conducted in early 2004 this process 
will be reviewed to make sure it is working 
effectively. 
--The U.S. Government agrees that normally the U.S. 
Embassy or an agency of the U.S. Government will submit 
a letter to the State Customs Committee (with a copy to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) one month prior to 
arrival of a commodities shipment covered by the 
Bilateral Agreement, stating the details of the 
shipment (arrival date, if known, else in general terms 
when it will arrive; and the general nature of the 
shipment).  The U.S. Government will endeavor to have 
the letters sent one month prior to arrival of a 
shipment, and the Government of Armenia will cooperate 
in clearing shipments when notice is given less than 
one month before arrival. 
--If any Government of Armenia officials have any 
questions on shipments imported into Armenia that could 
or is claimed to be under the Bilateral Agreement, then 
these officials must notify the U.S. Embassy 
immediately according to procedures that will be 
provided to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the U.S. 
Embassy. 
 
(23) The Minister of Finance and Economy agrees to 
rectify existing customs disputes as follows: 
 
--AEAI attempted to import wood dryers under a U.S. 
assistance program on energy efficiency.  Both sides 
acknowledge that this is a shipment of goods covered by 
the Bilateral Agreement.  USAID agrees to submit a 
description of this project to the Ministry of Finance 
and Economy before November 7.  The Ministry of Finance 
and Economy agrees to resolve this issue before 
November 14 by providing a letter allowing the import 
of these dryers under the Bilateral Agreement (i.e., 
without any taxes, customs duties, etc.).  The Customs 
Chairman acknowledges that this letter from the 
Ministry of Finance and Economy will override any 
position taken by the Customs Committee concerning the 
import of these dryers.  [Note:  This case was resolved 
in mid-November and the wood dryers are now in the 
possession of the U.S. Government implementing

--Counterpart International imported hygiene kits into 
Armenia, and has had problems with Customs officials 
concerning taxation of these commodities.  The Ministry 
of Finance and Economy agrees to discuss this issue 
with the Prosecutor General\'s office, since this case 
has already been referred by Customs to the 
Prosecutor\'s Office.  The U.S. Embassy will assign a 
person to answer any questions on this topic for the 
Ministry of Finance and Economy.  [Note:  This case was 
resolved in mid-December and the hygiene kits are now

(24) Both sides agree that two sub-committees - a 
Science Panel and a Trade and Investment Panel - of the 
U.S. Armenia Economic Task Force will be created before 
the next US-Armenia Economic Task Force meeting.  The 
Government of Armenia and the U.S. Government will 
designate points of contact that will report back to 
the Minister of Trade and Finance and the U.S. Embassy 
directly on progress made.  These Panels will be 
prepared to hold initial meetings at the next US- 
Armenia Economic Task Force meeting, if not before. 
 
(25) Both sides acknowledge that there will be no U.S. 
government monetization programs for Armenia in FY04. 
Prior to the due date for program proposals for FY05 
programs, the U.S. will discuss any possible proposals 
with project proponents, inviting consultation with the 
Ministry of Finance and Economy and related state 
agencies where appropriate.  If the U.S. Embassy 
supports these proposals, then it will discuss these 
with the Office of the Prime Minister.  If the Prime 
Minister provides written assurance to the U.S. Embassy 
at least six months prior to the beginning of FY05 
(April 1, 2004) that the Government of Armenia will 
support these programs under the Bilateral Agreement, 
meaning that no customs, VAT, unreasonable storage 
fees, or other import duties will be imposed, then the 
U.S. Embassy will convey its support for these 
proposals to the approving office within the U.S. 
Government.  Both sides acknowledge that such a 
recommendation by the U.S. Embassy will not guarantee 
that a project will be selected by the U.S. Government 
agency overseeing a monetization program. 
 
(26) The Government of Armenia is aware that any 
taxation of U.S. assistance by the Government of 
Armenia will be subject to a reduction in U.S 
assistance levels.  Both sides agree to work together 
to avoid any taxation of U.S. assistance, and will 
actively review any potential taxation issues in order 
to resolve the issue quickly.

Classified By: Ambassador John Ordway for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Armenian Deputy Defense Minister Artur 
Aghabekian informed DAO March 11 that Armenia is planning to 
send three officers to Baku in September 2004 to participate 
in NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) exercise Cooperative Best 
Effort 04 (CBE 04).  Aghabekian ruled out the possibility 
that Armenian officers would participate in the exercise as 
observers.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Deputy Defense Minister Artur Aghabekian told DAO that 
he is aware of the domestic pressures the Azerbaijani 
government faces in allowing Armenian military officers to 
participate in any activity in Baku.  He noted that Armenia 
went through a similar process last year when Armenia hosted 
CBE 03.  As a condition of hosting the exercise, Armenia had 
to consent to Turkish and Azerbaijani participation in the 
exercise.  Although Azerbaijan declined to participate, 
Turkey sent a small contingent.  Aghabekian said that most 
Armenians were opposed to the Turkish presence in Armenia, 
but the GOAM worked to convince the Armenian society that 
Turkish participation would not harm Armenian interests and 
could also provide political benefits.  Aghabekian stated 
that he wants to see the Government of Azerbaijan begin to 
prepare its public for Armenian participation in CBE 04, and 
to reduce the anti-Armenian rhetoric in public discourse. 
 
3. (C) Aghabekian stated that Armenia\'s interest in 
participating in CBE 04 is not to humiliate Azerbaijan for 
allowing Armenian military officers to participate in 
exercises in Baku.  Armenia\'s objective is to pressure 
Azerbaijan to tone down the anti-Armenian rhetoric throughout 
Azerbaijani society.  Aghabekian claimed that the current 
atmosphere does not allow for progress in negotiations over 
Nagorno-Karabakh.  He said Armenia would like to get to the 
point where Azerbaijani society considers Armenia an 
\"opponent\" rather than an \"enemy\" (Note.  Aghabekian used the 
Russian words \"protivnik\" and \"vrag\", saying that one could 
work with an opponent but not with an enemy.  End Note.) 
Aghabekian believes that this process had a beneficial effect 
on Armenian society last year during preparations for CBE 03 
and would like to see a similar process occur in Azerbaijan 
this year. 
 
4.  (C) The GOAM continues to oppose sending the officers to 
Baku as observers rather than participants, since Armenia did 
not make such a demand on Turkey or Azerbaijan last year. 
GOAM officials argue that NATO should take an even-handed 
approach to the countries in the region.  The MOD would like 
to incorporate the Armenian officers into NATO\'s exercise 
staff, which would limit the visibility of the Armenian 
presence. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: This proposal from the MOD appears to be the 
definitive response to the Azerbaijani offer of two 
observers.  If it is feasible for the Armenians to 
participate as part of the exercise staff, it strikes us that 
this is an attractive compromise that will allow the GOAM to 
claim that it is \"participating\" while allowing the GOAJ to 
claim that no Armenian unit is participating in the exercise. 
 The next steps appear to be (a) confirmation by NATO 
military authorities that three Armenians can be accommodated 
as part of the exercise staff, and (b) confirmation by Baku 
that this is an acceptable outcome.  END COMMENT

companies and the Union of Manufacturers and Entrepreneurs 
to a presentation of opportunities in Iraq on March 16. 
Drawing on Department of Commerce and Coalition Provision 
Authority websites, we explained the different types of 
opportunities that exist for Armenian firms in Iraq.  In 
particular we emphasized the difference between U.S. 
Government contracts and subcontracting or other private 
opportunities that are available to Armenian firms.  We 
demonstrated where to find contact information for primary 
contractors and where to find possible Iraqi partners.  We 
also presented the Department of Commerce\'s Business Guide 
for Iraq and gave out information on the upcoming trade show 
in Baghdad. 
 
2.  Armenia\'s largest construction firms, the largest 
automobile retailer, and the Armenian representative from 
Yukos Investments made up the audience.  They were well 
prepared for the presentation, and expressed strong interest 
in going to Iraq for the trade show.  They did not express 
any negative concerns about the fact that Armenians cannot 
bid on primary U.S. Government contracts.  We believe the 
outreach was successful both in responding to general 
interest and in getting those with specific and genuine 
interest to the information they need to move forward.

1. (C) An interagency delegation met with the Deputy 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defense March 11 to outline 
a United States proposal to shift the focus of NATO 
Partnership for Peace (PfP) activities to the Caucasus and 
Central Asia.  The delegation also discussed the necessity to 
reach a compromise with Azerbaijan over the NATO PfP

University also visited Yerevan March 10-11 to discuss 
enhanced NATO PfP activities with GOAM officials.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
DELEGATIONS PROMOTE INCREASED NATO FOCUS IN CAUCASUS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (C) An interagency delegation including Eric Schultz 
(Deputy Director, EUR/RPM), Bruce Rogers (Deputy Polad, 
USNATO), and Dennis Skocz  (OSD, NATO Policy Office) met with 
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tatul Margarian and Deputy 
Minister of Defense Artur Aghabekian March 11  to discuss and 
solicit Armenia\'s support for the U.S. proposed shift in PfP 
focus to the Caucasus and Central Asia regions (refs A and 
B).  The delegation sought to gain Armenia\'s support for a 
regional NATO liaison office that could better shape NATO PfP 
programs to Armenia\'s needs,  encourage defense reform, and 
promote greater military interoperability  with NATO forces. 
The delegation also encouraged the GOAM officials to reach a 
compromise with Azerbaijan over the continuing dispute over 
the upcoming Cooperative Best Effort 2004 (CBE 04) exercises 
to be held in  Azerbaijan.  The delegation relayed a 
compromise proposed by Azerbaijani Deputy Foreign Minister 
Araz Azimov, whereby Azerbaijan would allow two  Armenian 
officers to attend the conference as \"participants\" in 
another  country\'s military unit, and urged Margarian and 
Aghabekian to give it full consideration. 
 
3. (SBU) National Defense University professors Dr. Eugene 
Rumer and Dr. Jeffrey Simon also visited Yerevan March 10-11 
to discuss ways to make the Partnership for Peace program 
more relevant to the countries of the South Caucasus and 
Central Asia and solicited advice on how NATO can modify the 
PfP program to address the new global security environment. 
Rumer and Simon met with Margarian and Aghabekian, as well as 
Mher Shadelghian, Chairman of the National Assembly\'s Defense 
Committee. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
USG DELEGATION SOLICITS GOAM OPINIONS ON PFP AND CBE 04 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4. (C) Margarian told the USG delegation that the GOAM 
supported the U.S. proposal for a strategic shift in PfP, 
saying that Armenia had been in favor of such an approach for 
over a year.  He said Armenia not only favored closer ties 
with NATO but was also interested in membership someday and 
in that regard was prepared to work seriously on the 
Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP).  He said Armenia 
would welcome a NATO liaison office in the Caucasus, 
preferably one in-country, which would more effectively meet 
Armenia\'s needs.  Margarian said that if a regional office 
was established in Tbilisi, he would expect its staff to 
spend approximately equal time every month in Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, and Georgia.  Margarian further suggested that 
the United States and NATO better define what is meant by 
\"increased engagement\" with the region.  He said he 
understood that it is important to begin a \"process\" of 
cooperation but that his colleagues in the MOD and elsewhere 
in the GOAM take these proposals very seriously, and would 
require an explanation of what concrete programs and 
initiatives would be included. 
 
5.  (C) Margarian initially said Armenia would stick to PfP 
principles and continue to press for full participation in 
CBE 04.  He reminded the delegation that Armenia had extended 
an invitation to Azerbaijan to participate in the CBE 03 
hosted in Armenia, and had accepted Turkish soldiers as 
participants in the same exercises, both politically 
difficult decisions to take.  Margarian pointed out that NATO 
was a possible forum to bring the two countries together, but 
Azerbaijan continued to resist any cooperation and seemed 
intent on excluding Armenia from NATO and PfP.  (Note. 
Margarian made the same argument in a meeting with a 
delegation from the United States Air War College the 
previous week.  End Note.)  Margarian acknowledged Schultz\'s 
point that if the exercises were canceled, no one would win 
and that other NATO allies might use the failure of CBE 04 as 
a reason to oppose further cooperation with the region, 
including other PfP exercises. Margarian said the decision 
would rest with the MOD, noting that they would need to be 
convinced to send two officers rather than five to seven. 
 
------------------------------------- 
MOD OFFERS COUNTER-PROPOSAL ON CBE 04 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Deputy Defense Minister Artur Aghabekian emphasized 
that cooperation with NATO under the PfP program is one of 
the key elements of Armenia\'s security strategy.  Addressing 
concerns that Armenia is not as active as other countries in 
PfP, Aghabekian noted that Armenia prefers to take time to 
review thoroughly the feasibility of an endeavor prior to 
committing to action.  This is one reason why Armenia signed 
up for NATO\'s Planning and Review Process (PARP) later than 
its neighbors.  Armenia also had to deal with a society that 
has always identified NATO with Turkey and committing to 
closer ties with NATO was not necessarily a popular decision 
in Armenia.  This same deliberative process is underway 
concerning Armenia\'s first Individual Partnership Action Plan 
(IPAP), but that Armenia did plan to submit one in the near 
future.  Aghabekian stated that he understood NATO\'s logic in 
placing the first office in Tbilisi and he believed this 
would be a good first step toward regional cooperation. 
 
7. (C) Regarding CBE 04, Aghabekian stated that Armenia would 
not agree to being limited to observer status for the 
exercise, since Armenia had allowed Turkish participation in 
Yerevan last year.  At a reception later in the evening, 
Aghabekian informed DAO that Armenia could accept sending 
three officers to the exercise as participants (see reftel C.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
NDU PROFESSORS SEEK PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE PFP PROGRAM 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8. (C) While meeting with Professors Rumer and Simon, neither 
Margarian nor Aghabekian offered any concrete proposals for 
improving the PfP program, but each stated that PfP remains 
the only viable forum for advancing cooperation in the 
region.  When asked about the possibility of Armenia 
supporting a Greater Black Sea Ministerial process, neither 
Margarian nor Aghabekian showed any particular interest 
toward the idea, but both stated that they would not be 
opposed to such an initiative and that any new initiatives 
would be examined on their merits.  Both emphasized that 
Armenia views PfP as the best method of pursuing regional 
security through cooperative programs.  Shadelghian and 
Aghabekian felt that regional cooperation should be pursued 
in the area of crisis response/disaster management. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (C) The visit of the USG and NDU delegations provided GOAM 
officials with an opportunity to discuss their commitment to 
enhancing cooperative efforts with NATO through the PfP 
framework.  The GOAM seems firmly behind initiatives to 
expand on their NATO relationship, though officials still 
seek further elucidation on what PfP\'s \"strategic shift\" 
means and entails for Armenia.  Importantly, the GOAM seems 
willing to step back from some of its rhetoric over the CBE 
04 exercises and accept a compromise solution that allows the 
Azerbaijani government to save some face.  Furthermore, the 
MFA and MOD also seem willing to move past the February 18 
Budapest murder, and fully engage in PfP activities.

ARMENIA

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili paid 
his first state visit to Armenia March 11-12, praising 
the country and its president as an \"ideal partner.\" 
Saakashvili and Armenian President Robert Kocharian 
focused their discussion on strengthening economic ties 
between the two countries and improving the situation 
in the Armenian-populated Georgian region of Javahketi. 
Armenian opposition leaders, who view Saakashvili\'s 
ascent to power as a model for their own anti- 
government campaign, saw their position undercut by the 
Georgian leader\'s warm public statements regarding his 
Armenian counterpart.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------- 
ECONOMIC TIES TO BE STRENGTHENED? 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) GOAM officials endorsed Saakashvili\'s proposal 
for increased bilateral economic integration and the re- 
establishment of the Armenian-Georgian Commission on 
Economic Cooperation to be co-chaired by Armenian Prime 
Minister Andranik Margarian and Georgian State Minister 
Zurab Zhvania.  Before Saakashvili\'s visit, Armenian 
authorities stressed the importance of reaching an 
accord to lower Georgia\'s freight charges on state- 
owned rail lines used by Armenia, which are 
substantially higher than those Georgia imposes on 
Azerbaijan. (Note:  Approximately 80 percent of 
Armenia\'s trade transits through Georgia.  Armenia has 
long contended that Georgia imposes discriminatory 
tariffs on freight from Armenia in violation of its WTO 
commitments.  End Note.)  Though Saakashvili and 
Kocharian reached no formal agreement on the freight 
tariffs, Saakashvili reiterated his support for 
economically integrating the countries through the 
removal of trade and immigration barriers.  Deputy 
Minister of Industry and Trade Tigran Davtyan told us 
that Saakashvili promised to \"solve\" the freight charge 
issue.  Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian also 
endorsed in principle Saakashvili\'s proposal to re- 
start economic ties with Azerbaijan as a first step to 
reconciliation.  He noted, however, that the 
Azerbaijani government has rejected such proposals in 
the past.  Oskanian told us that discussions with 
Saakashvili had been \"productive.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
PRESIDENTS DISCUSS OPENING TWO RAILWAYS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Kocharian and Oskanian pushed Saakashvili to 
support the re-opening of rail lines in the region.  Of 
prime importance to Armenia is the long-closed railway 
running from Armenia to Russia through the breakaway 
Georgian province of Abkhazia.  Kocharian hopes that 
Saakashvili will take a more conciliatory stand towards 
Abkhazia than his predecessor, Eduard Shevardnadze. 
Oskanian told journalists that the GOAM sought 
Saakashvili\'s help, as part of a larger Georgian effort 
to become engaged in regional dispute resolution, in 
pressuring Turkey to re-open an East-West rail line 
that connects the three countries.  The Turkish 
blockade of Armenia has closed the Kars-Gyumri-Tbilisi 
rail line, and its opening would help end Armenia\'s 
economic isolation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
KOCHARIAN PLEDGES NO INTERFERENCE IN JAHVAHKETI 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (SBU) Saakashvili sought and received a pledge from 
Kocharian not to interfere with Georgia\'s 
administration of its ethnically Armenian province of 
Javahketi.  Saakashvili told a press conference that he 
appreciated Kocharian\'s \"principled stand\" on the 
Javahketi issue, and that he was \"thankful to the 
Armenian president for his strict position on 
territorial integrity and stability in Georgia.\"  Both 
presidents agreed to collaborate to find ways to 
improve the economic situation in the region, which is 
one of Georgia\'s poorest.  In a joint declaration, 
Saakashvili and Kocharian noted the need to develop 
Javahketi, and as a first step build a road from 
Tbilisi to the region. (Note:  This is a reaction to 
calls by the ARF, a partner in the governing coalition, 
for autonomy in Javahketi.  Our recent contacts with 
the ARF leadership suggest they may have a slightly 
more nuanced view, and are clearly aware of the need 
for stability and keeping Javahketi as part of Georgia. 
They warmly welcomed the appointment of Nikoloz 
Nikolozishvili, the Georgian Ambassador to Armenia, as 
Governor of Javahketi.  End Note.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
COMMENT: POSITIVE FIRST IMPRESSION 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Though no formal agreements were announced 
during Saakashvili\'s visit, the GOAM appears to be 
pleased at the reaffirmation of strong bilateral ties 
following the change of power in Tbilisi.  The 
political turmoil in Georgia during the past four 
months had caused substantial consternation in Armenia, 
whose leadership feared that destabilization in Georgia 
could further isolate Armenia and potentially cause a 
severe economic crisis.  Saakashvili seemed intent on 
not only maintaining the status quo, but also enhancing 
Georgia\'s relationship with Armenia.  Saakashvili 
appeared more willing than his predecessor to lower 
Georgian freight tariffs and pursue an opening of the 
railway through Abkhazia, two long-standing desires of 
the GOAM. 
 
7. (SBU) Saakashvili\'s visit potentially alters the 
domestic political situation in Armenia.  The Georgian 
President\'s seemingly amiable relationship with 
Kocharian could possibly weaken the opposition\'s drive 
to unseat Kocharian.  Saakashvili has been a model for 
the opposition leaders (Stepan Demirchian, Armen 
Sargsian, and Artashes Geghamian), who have 
consistently cited Georgia\'s \"rose revolution\" and 
Saakashvili as models for their announced \"Hot Spring\" 
campaign to bring down the Armenian government.  While 
in Armenia, Saakashvili praised Kocharian past the 
point of diplomatic courtesy, telling journalists that 
\"Armenia is fortunate to have such a president,\" and 
that Kocharian is an \"ideal partner.\"  Such statements 
by a man widely respected in Armenia could help deflate 
whatever slight momentum the opposition has gained in 
their continuing bid to oust Kocharian.

2. (U) On March 17 Kocharian unexpectedly sacked 
Procurator General Tamazian, replacing him with his 
most influential deputy, Aghvan Hovsepian.  A strong 
supporter of Kocharian, Hovsepian already held this 
post from 1998-99.  The President\'s decree gave no

TAMAZIAN OUT, HOVSEPIAN IN 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Kocharian unexpectedly sacked Armenia\'s 
Procurator-General Aram Tamazian and replaced him with 
his most influential deputy Aghvan Hovsepian March 17. 
A staunch Kocharian loyalist, Hovsepian previously held 
the post from 1998-99.  (Note:  He resigned in the wake 
of the October 27, 1999 attack on the Armenian 
parliament.  End Note.)  Hovsepian had since worked as 
a deputy Procurator General, however, and many local 
observers regarded him as even more influential than 
Tamazian. 
 
4. (SBU) One of the country\'s most powerful law- 
enforcement officials, Hovsepian has extensive business 
interests, reportedly controlling a dairy firm and a TV 
channel.  He has also built a political support base 
among prominent natives from his home district of 
Aparan, a number of whom were elected to parliament 
last year.  (Note:  The ARF Dashnaktsutyun, one of the 
three parties represented in the government, criticized 
Hovsepian\'s covert engagement in politics last year. 
End Note.)

BIO NOTES

5. (U) Aghvan Hovsepian, 50, graduated from Yerevan 
State University law school in 1974.  He worked as 
investigator in the Karelian Autonomous Republic of 
Russia until 1978, then moved to Nagorno-Karabakh as 
head of the Investigation Department of the local 
Procurator\'s office.  In 1986, Hovsepian was 
transferred to the Regional Procurator\'s office in 
Artik district (rayon) of Armenia as investigator.  In 
1989 Hovsepian was appointed investigator for special 
cases at the Armenian Procurator General\'s office.  In 
1991 he was elected to the Armenian parliament where he 
served until 1995; even during his parliamentarian 
term, however, Hovsepian continued to work at the 
Procurator General\'s office, eventually becoming chief 
of the criminal investigations department in April 
1998.  From 1998-99 Hovsepian served as Procurator 
General, and from 1999 until March 17 he was deputy 
Procurator General.  Hovsepian is married, with three 
children.

2. (SBU) Deputy Minister of Trade Tigran Davtyan called for 
a meeting with us March 17, 2004 to protest the failure of 
the United States to graduate Armenia from the restrictions 
of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.  Davtyan said that Jackson- 
Vanik puts Armenia in the same legal position (i.e., non- 
application of WTO) with the United States as with Turkey, a 
fact which he described as \"uncomfortable.\"  He also pointed 
out that the U.S. graduated Georgia from Jackson-Vanik 
within six months of its accession to the WTO.  \"We want 
equal treatment\" with Georgia, Davtyan insisted.  He also 
argued that uncertainty based on Armenia\'s year-to-year need 
for waivers or findings of compliance discouraged investment 
in trade with the United States.  Davtyan added that he 
avoids the topic of the United States\' non-application 
status when speaking to businessmen or the public, but that 
as time goes on he foresees the situation becoming \"very 
embarrassing.\"

Washington had been instructed to deliver a similar message, 
and that the GOAM had resolved to push the issue strongly on 
all fronts because they feel that too much time has passed

SUBJECT:  ARMENIA: SEIZURES AND INVESTIGATIONS OF RADIOLOGICAL 
SOURCES DETECTED IN SCRAP METAL EXPORTS TO IRAN 
 
Sensitive but unclassified. Please protect accordingly. 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The GOAM has, for the first time, shared 
information with EXBS Advisor about ongoing export violation 
investigations and radiological seizures.  This is the 
result of ongoing efforts to obtain statistical data from 
Armenian National Security Service to measure the 
effectiveness of EXBS equipment and programs at Armenia\'s 
ports of entry/exit.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) EXBS Advisor is in frequent contact with officials 
at the National Security Service on a variety of EXBS- 
related issues.  In order to measure the effectiveness of 
EXBS equipment purchases and equipment use we have often 
requested information relating to seizures of radiological 
sources and export violations resulting from these seizures. 
The National Security Service recently gave EXBS Advisor the 
information cited below. 
 
3. (SBU) Below is an unofficial embassy translation of the 
information provided by the National Security Service to 
EXBS Advisor.  A laboratory at the Armenia Nuclear Power 
Plant (ANPP) analyzed the sources.  The Armenia Nuclear 
Regulatory Agency sent all information about the detected 
sources to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 
Geneva.  There have been no arrests made as a result of 
these investigations.  In all reported cases, the National 
Security Service has determined that the exporters were 
unaware that their scrap metal exports contained radioactive 
material.  The Portal Monitor detected all but one of the 
radiation sources intercepted passing through the Port of 
Meghri on the way to the Iranian Border. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
Cylinder container with 2 grams radioactive isotope. 
Strontium-90 radioactive source. 
Strontium-90+Itrium-90 radioactive source with approximately 
20,000 mcR/hour. 
A radioactive source used as a forecasting station with 
about 20,000 Curie was found at the Khosrov Preserve, 
located about 50km from Yerevan. 
A meter for measuring liquids was found and, according to 
the ANPP, the meter was contaminated with isotopes [214]Bi, 
[228]AC with 4000 mcR/hour Gamma radiation. 
1,510 x 60 x 30 mm size aluminum construction with 4,000 
mcR/hour radiation. 
Aluminum sheets, contaminated with [214]Bi, [228]AC, 
[232]Th, [226]Ra radioactive element. 
Strontium-90 radioactive source with a diameter 1,5cm and 
1,5 cm height. 
Electronica humidity meter, containing plutonium beryllium 
neutron radiation source with 6,000 mcR/hour radiation.  END 
TEXT. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT: EXBS advisor notes the lack of detail and 
investigative precision surrounding these radiation seizures 
and will work toward curing this problem.  EXBS will work to 
ensure that the National Security Service, Border Guards, 
and Customs understand the importance of routinely releasing 
information like this as an important step in evaluating the 
effectiveness of the Armenian EXBS Program.  EXBS Advisor 
considers it a small but important first step taken by 
National Security Service.

REF: A) STATE 55077 B) NEW YORK 00516 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John Ordway for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Ambassador raised USG priorities for UNCHR-60 with FM 
Oskanian March 15 per instructions in reftel A.  Oskanian was 
generally non-committal, but promised to review the USG 
proposals on China and Cuba with Armenia\'s missions in 
Geneva, New York and Washington.  Oskanian hinted that 
Armenia\'s candidature for the 2005-2007 UNCHR could mean that 
any GOAM support for USG initiatives could be more measured 
than Washington might hope or expect.  While he would not 
commit GOAM support, his comments suggested that the GOAM was 
more likely to support a Cuba resolution than the China 
resolution. 
 
2. (C) Comment:  Oskanian\'s comments contrasted with earlier 
signals from mid-level MFA officials.  Earlier hints for 
greater support during this year\'s UNCHR, specifically for 
the Cuba resolution, appear to have lost steam.  While MFA 
contacts are not hiding their disappointment with the USG\'s 
quiet response thus far to Armenia\'s UNCHR candidature, we 
can safely assume that this is only partially responsible for 
this change in posture.  There appears to be real concern 
among GOAM officials at some level about Armenia\'s 
candidature for the UNCHR.  Armenia\'s highest priority is to 
avoid a loss of face in the re-election campaign and they are 
undoubtedly keeping a close eye on where the votes are.  Our 
contacts continue to stress the importance of Yerevan\'s role 
in UN-related issues.  GOAM representatives in Geneva and New 
York are reportedly now taking a back seat to the MFA\'s newly 
appointed Director of Multilateral Affairs on important 
policy decisions.  We will listen closely for signals from 
the MFA regarding the Cuba resolution after the Department\'s 
March 15 meeting with Ambassadors in Washington.  End comment.

WHO DOES AZNAR SUPPORT? 
 
2. Dashnak-affiliated HAYOTS ASHKHAR newspaper (03/18) 
published an article discussing the terrorist acts in 
Madrid.  \"The terrorist acts in the Spanish capital

The most terrible thing about this terrorist act was 
its predictability.  Of course, no one could have 
predicted the exact day and place of the terrorist act, 
nor could anyone predict exactly how the terrorists 
would strike Spain, but no one ever doubted that 
something like this would happen.  When the media

audacious policy.\"  \"Doubtless, the roots of the 
current tragedy go back to the time when the ambitious 
[Prime Minister] Aznar decided to ignore the UN 
Security Council\'s opinion and enter the Anglo-American 
alliance [in Iraq].\"  \"The secret of this 
\"shortsightedness\" [meaning the government\'s insistence 
that ETA was responsible for the blasts] is clear: 
Spain was going to hold parliamentary elections three 
days after the terrorist acts, after which, according 
to the Spanish Constitution, the current Prime Minister 
could no longer occupy this post.  The farsighted Aznar 
had already found a replacement for himself when he 
appointed M. Rajo (sp.) to lead the Popular Party and 
he was hoping for a quiet life afterwards.  However, 
the terrorist acts clearly demonstrated the dangers of 
Aznar\'s audacious policy and cast serious doubts on his 
party\'s victory in the upcoming elections.\"  \"The 
results of the Spanish elections are already known to 
our readers.  The Popular Party lost, despite the fact 
that, even a week before the elections, they were 
widely expected to win.  The Spanish people can forgive 
stupidity, but not lying.\"

REF: YEREVAN 615 
 
Classified By: Charge Vivian Walker for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  The Ministry of Defense (MOD) informed DAO 
March 22 that Armenia intends to send 12 participants to the 
NATO PfP exercise Cooperative Best Effort 04 (CBE 04) in 
Baku.  The decision comes after a previous MOD pledge to send 
only 3 officers to the exercise in a compromise to the CBE 04 
impasse with Azerbaijan.  The decision to back out of the 
compromise seems to have been made by Minister of Defense 
Serzh Sargsyan.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) The MOD told DAO March 19, and confirmed March 22, 
that Armenia would send 12 participants to CBE 04 in Baku. 
The decision backtracks from a previous pledge by Deputy 
Defense Minister Artur Aghabekian (see reftel) to send only 
three officers to the exercise.  The MOD asserted that under 
PfP rules Armenia is entitled to determine at which level it 
will participate in any given event. 
 
3. (C) We stressed to GOAM officials the importance of 
reaching a compromise with Azerbaijan, and that if the 
exercise were canceled Armenia would not escape blame. 
Deputy Defense Minister Mikhail Melkonian told DAO March 19 
that he understood U.S. concerns, and that they would be 
taken into full consideration.  The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Head of the NATO Department, Hrachia Tashchian, told 
us he was surprised by the MOD decision, and that the MFA had 
not been consulted.  (Note: In a subsequent conversation with 
Charge, Deputy Foreign Minister Tatoul Margarian confirmed 
that the MFA \"had known nothing about this decision.\"  End 
Note.) 
 
4. (C) Comment. The decision to renege on the CBE 04 
compromise seems to have been made at the highest level of 
the MOD, despite Deputy Defense Minister Aghabekian\'s 
expressed commitment to reach a compromise on exercise 
participation.  Judging from Deputy Foreign Minster 
Margarian\'s reaction to the MOD decision, there appears to be 
very little desire within the GOAM to make any compromises 
with Azerbaijan in the aftermath of the murder in Budapest.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Despite recent media reports about an Iran- 
Armenia gas pipeline deal, our meeting March 22, 2004 
with Deputy Minister of Energy Areg Galstyan confirms 
that any such deal is still more a vague, albeit 
strong, desire than a real plan.  Both the Deputy 
Minister and resident European Delegation 
representative Moret dismissed press reports that the 
EU will pay for the pipeline in exchange for an early 
closure date of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant 
(ANPP).  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
EU NOT LIKELY TO PAY FOR PIPELINE 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Europe\'s longstanding 100 million euro offer 
for Armenia to set an early closure date for ANPP has 
set the backdrop for numerous press reports that the 
European Union will pay for the Iran-Armenia gas 
pipeline in exchange for closing the nuclear plant. 
But both Deputy Minister Galstyan and Jean-Francois 
Moret, the EU\'s Programs Coordinator in Armenia, told 
us that the EU has never offered the money for the 
purpose of building the gas line, which Armenia wants 
in order to diversify its energy sources rather than to 
replace the production capacity of the ANPP.  The EU 
has offered money only for the purpose of replacing the 
capacity lost due to an early closure of the ANPP. 
(Note: The status of the EU\'s offer is in doubt since 
the bilateral meeting February 10th.  There the EU 
representative said that Armenia\'s concerns about 
energy diversity cast doubt on any imminent closure of 
the ANPP even with the EU money to build replacement 
capacity, and that the EU must therefore review their 
commitment to the offer.  See Reftel.  End Note). 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
NEW GAS LINE WOULD ADD DIVERSITY, NOT CAPACITY 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (SBU) According to Mr. Galstyan, there are two 
conditions for Armenia agreeing to a date to close the 
ANPP:  it must have replacement electricity production 
capacity, and it must have a diverse base of energy 
sources.  Mr. Galstyan pointed out that the gas 
pipeline addresses the problem of diversity but does 
nothing to add capacity, which is limited by the output 
of Armenia\'s gas burning power plants.  The current gas 
pipeline through Georgia has significant unutilized 
capacity, and could supply enough gas to meet the 
replacement capacity of the ANPP if Armenia upgraded 
existing thermal plants or built new ones.  But 
Armenia, he notes, is unwilling to accept such a large 
share of its energy supply depending on the single gas 
line through Georgia.  While the Iran-Armenia gas line 
would surely satisfy Armenia\'s post-ANPP demands for a 
diverse energy supply, to also increase capacity would 
nevertheless require the development of new thermal 
power resources exceeding the cost of the pipeline. 
 
------------------- 
IF NOT THE EU, WHO? 
------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Deputy Minister Galstyan said that he thinks 
that the likelihood of receiving European money for the 
pipeline is small, and that finding money for the 
Armenian portion of the project was still a major 
obstacle.  According to Galstyan, Iran is willing to 
construct the Iranian portion of the pipeline.  He 
hopes for USD 40 million in grants and another USD 60 
million in investment in the pipeline to finance the 
Armenian portion, but said that there were no obvious 
sources of money at this time.  He said that the talks 
about the pipeline do include ArmRusGazprom, but that 
their financial involvement can be only \"secondary\". 
Galstyan disparaged press reports stating the details 
of a deal with Iran, saying that no one knows anything 
yet about prices, quantity or even the destination or 
diameter of the pipeline.  These variables will 
ultimately depend on the economics of the pipeline and 
the decisions of its financiers. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
5. (SBU) the Iran-Armenia pipeline idea has gained no 
traction over the past ten years because no one has 
been willing to pay for it.  The possible connection 
with the EU\'s 100 million dollar offer to close the 
ANPP does not, in itself, change the situation because 
the pipeline cannot itself meet Armenia\'s two necessary 
conditions for closing the ANPP:  replacement capacity 
and diversity.  Because any large-scale EU assistance 
depends on a closure date of the ANPP, the \"deal\" as 
often outlined in the press cannot give both sides an 
acceptable outcome.

Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was reported on all Armenian TV 
channels, the reports being mainly factual.  However, 
some local papers published commentaries.  The 
following is the summary of the articles. END SUMMARY 
 
MIDDLE EAST ON THE VERGE OF A NEW WAR? 
 
2. Government official Armenian language daily 
HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTIUN (03/24) draws parallels between 
the reaction of Washington and Moscow.  \"Ahmed Yassin\'s 
assassination showed that the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict is entering a new and uncompromising phase, 
where the situation can shift from separate terrorist 
acts to a large-scale war.  An interesting observation: 
while Washington\'s calm reaction (to put it mildly) to 
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin\'s assassination was understandable, 
Moscow was also strangely restrained in its statement.\" 
 
THE AMERICAN BALANCE 
 
3. Oppositionist Armenian daily HAYKAKAN ZHAMANAK 
(03/24) also focused on the reaction of the Bush 
Administration to the assassination.  \"The main 
initiator of the Middle East peace process, the United 
States has still not condemned the assassination of the 
spiritual leader of the extremist Palestinian 
organization HAMAS, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin.  The White 
House is trying to maintain a balance, which angers the 
Arabs.  Observers note that the Bush administration 
would have adopted a clearer position had it not been 
for the November 2 presidential elections.  Unlike the 
United States, almost all European countries, including 
Great Britain, have condemned the HAMAS spiritual 
leader\'s assassination.\" 
 
SHEIKH\'S LESSONS 
 
4. Oppositionist Armenian daily ARAVOT (03/24) stresses 
the attitude of the world toward this killing.  \"The 
fact of the assassination of the founder and spiritual 
leader of the Palestinian Hamas movement, Sheikh Ahmed 
Yassin, by the Israeli air force had a litmus paper 
effect by simply showing how far the world, or at least 
its civilized part, is from the realization of the 
importance of strengthening the universal principles 
and standards of political culture.  In addition to the 
Arab world, a number of European countries joined the 
ranks of those who condemned the actions aimed at 
neutralizing Yassin.  It is interesting that they 
included that dedicated member of the international 
counter-terrorism movement, Great Britain.  However, 
when we `translate\' what has happened into a simple and 
understandable language, we get the following story. 
There is a rather large group of Palestinian killers, 
who have been consistently stripped of their 
intelligence ever since their childhood and have become 
like zombies, who couldn\'t care less about their own 
lives, and who regularly carry out bloody terrorist 
acts against peaceful Israeli citizens.   However, for 
some reason, the world voices its `justified\' protests 
when the main organizer and the `brain center\' of the 
suicide terrorists is killed, even though it seems that 
this should not have been the case.  The arguments are 
extremely ironic.  `A dangerous new wave of violence is 
going to start now,\' threatens a scared Europe, 
implying that the old wave of violence was less 
dangerous in the days of Yassin, who did nothing but 
organize terrorist acts all the time.  `The United 
States, who has always been against extra-judicial 
killings, does not want to condemn Yassin\'s 
assassination,\' Russia says in bewilderment, while 
Russian media runs headlines about the Russian Special 
Forces killing some more or less important Chechen 
rebels for weeks on end.  It is quite appropriate here 
to remember one of Putin\'s famous statements: `There 
should be no mercy towards terrorists; if necessary, 
we\'ll destroy them in a bathroom.\'\"

clearly whether it refers to the 2003 presidential and 
parliamentary elections or U.S.-Armenian relations in 
general.  We should remind you that Washington did not 
congratulate President Kocharian on his re-election and 
criticized the parliamentary elections.  The fact that 
only in Armenia Armitage did not meet with the 
opposition in the countries scheduled for the visit 
also needs some clarifications.  The American diplomat 
definitely had been informed about the tension in the 
internal political situation of Armenia.  This raises a 
question, whether not meeting opposition means that 
Armitage wanted to defuse the tension or that he did 
not want to encourage the opposition.\"  \"On the eve of 
his visit the U.S. State Department released a 
statement saying that during his visits to Ukraine, 
Armenia and Azerbaijan Armitage, in addition to 
official meetings, will also meet with political 
leaders and groups.  It can be assumed that today, 
besides the official talks in Baku, Armitage will meet 
with the opposition leaders, namely with Isa Gambar 
(sp.) from \"Musafat\" party and Ali Qerimli (sp.) from 
\"National Front.\"   The Azeri mass media say that by 
this Armitage wants to win over the opposition.  It is 
known that the Deputy Secretary of State had good 
friendly relations with the late Heydar Aliyev and now 
he continues these friendly relations with his son, 
Ilham Aliyev.  During one of the conversations Richard 
Armitage told Ilham Aliyev that the latter resembles 
his father and that is why he [Armitage} has a special 
respect for Ilham.  By the way, the opposition in 
Azerbaijan is condemning Armitage for a decline of 
democracy in Azerbaijan.\" 
 
ONLY PROGRESS 
 
3. Oppositionist Armenian daily HAYKAKAN ZHAMANAK 
(03/27) published a front-page short report calling 
some statements made by the Deputy Secretary 
sensational.  \"Yesterday U.S. Deputy Secretary of State 
Richard Armitage made a sensational statement saying 
that there were no agreements reached in Key West but 
only progress.  The statement is sensational taking 
into account the fact that the Foreign Ministry of 
Armenia has been trying not only to convince us that 
some agreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan on 
Karabakh were reached at Key West, but also has been 
insisting that those agreements were put on paper.  The 
Foreign Ministry of Azerbaijan has been insisting on 
the opposite with the same persistence.  In fact, 
Armitage yesterday confirmed what they [Azerbaijan] 
have been saying.\" 
 
ACCORDING TO U.S. THERE WAS PROGRESS NOT AN AGREEMENT 
 
4. Dashnak-affiliated HAYOTS ASHKHAR (03/27) also 
focused on Armitage\'s answer regarding the Key West 
agreements.  \"Armitage as a participant of Key West 
talks did not deny the fact of agreements, but as a 
diplomat he tried to present it in such a way that he 
would not put the president of Azerbaijan in a 
difficult situation before his [Armitage\'s] visit to 
Azerbaijan.\"  \"R. Armitage insisted on the necessity of 
continuation of negotiations even after the comment 
made by one of the journalists saying that Azerbaijan 
expressed misgivings regarding the activities of the 
OSCE Minsk group.\" 
 
NOT AGREEMENTS BUT PROGRESS 
 
5. Oppositionist Armenian daily ARAVOT (03/27) wrote: 
\"The priorities of the United States foreign policy can 
be easily identified by the \"ranks\" of U.S. officials 
visiting different regions.  For example, U.S. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell visits Iraq, and 
 
SIPDIS 
sometimes Afghanistan.  His Deputy Armitage is visiting 
CIS countries, and the South Caucasus in particular. 
Mr. Armitage actually proved this during his press 
conference yesterday held at the Presidential Palace.\" 
I AM HERE TO TRY TO REINVIGORATE POLITICAL TALKS 
 
6. Pro-government Russian language newspaper NOVOYE 
VREMYA (03/27) published comments on Key West talks and 
Armitage\'s participation in them.  \"In Key West he 
personally took part in the talks, and according to 
him, Heydar Aliyev faced serious difficulties in his 
fatherland when upon his return he presented the 
discussed proposal for resolution of the conflict. 
Perhaps there is a small contradiction here.  If there 
was no agreement what kind of \"certain progress\" can we 
talk about?  It is also not clear why Aliyev faced 
difficulties if there were no agreements.\" 
 
RICHARD ARMITAGE ANSWERS QUESTIONS 
 
7. Pro-government Russian language newspaper GOLOS 
ARMENII (03/27) published a mainly factual report on 
the press conference with only one commentary.  \"In the 
best traditions of American abstruseness was the answer 
to a question about Baku\'s unwillingness to sit at the 
negotiation table, which was demonstrated by the recent 
statement by the Azeri authorities to postpone the 
meeting scheduled by the OSCE Minsk group to be held in 
Prague.\"

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Heckling, a fistfight and the subsequent 
arrest of four opposition supporters overshadowed the 
start of a Justice Bloc-sponsored political rally in 
the northern city of Gyumri on March 28 (ref).  Police 
eventually restored order and the rally and later 
closed-door consultations between opposition and local 
leaders finished without further incident.  Last 
Sunday\'s events, the most violent since the opposition 
rallies during last year\'s Presidential campaign, have 
sparked speculation that opposition rallies scheduled 
for this April will reveal a contentious political 
atmosphere and could lead to more unrest.  Opposition 
leaders and some political analysts are pointing to the 
Gyumri incident as proof that forces loyal to President 
Robert Kocharian are \"running scared\" and will resort 
to shady tactics to discredit the opposition.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
HECKLING, VIOLENCE AND ARRESTS KICK OFF RALLY 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) An opposition rally in Armenia\'s second-largest 
city, Gyumri, got off to a tumultuous start March 28 
when pro-Government and pro-opposition demonstrators 
exchanged punches, launched eggs and hurled insults, 
ending in four arrests.  A group of 10-15 women 
(referred to in press reports as \"known prostitutes\" 
and rumored to have been enlisted for the event) joined 
the rally holding anti-opposition banners and clashed 
with opposition supporters shortly after the start of 
the event.  According to reports from Embassy sources, 
the violence began after hecklers threw eggs and set- 
off firecrackers during People\'s Party President and 
\"Justice Bloc\" leader Stepan Demirchian\'s opening 
address.  A group of unidentified men, two of whom were 
allegedly plainclothes police officers, approached 
Demirchian and engaged in a fistfight with his 
bodyguards and others.  Police arrested four opposition 
supporters (including the driver of Justice Bloc leader 
Albert Bazeyan) following the scuffle. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
DEMIRCHIAN:  VIOLENCE A \"CLEAR PROVOCATION\" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Despite conflicting reports, Demirchian and a 
handful of Justice Bloc representatives eventually did 
complete their rally and met with local supporters in 
closed-door consultations regarding future 
demonstrations in Yerevan scheduled for sometime in 
early April.  Demirchian referred to the violence as a 
\"clear provocation\" from the Kocharian.  Later that 
night, Demirchian made high-profile appeals to local 
authorities to release the four men arrested during the 
scuffle.  (Note:  Post has no information on the 
detainees\' treatment during their imprisonment or 
updates regarding their release.  End note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
POLICE:  \"UNABLE TO GUARANTEE PROTESTORS\' SAFETY\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5. (SBU) Organizers of the opposition rally claim that 
local police stated in a letter before March 28 that 
they were \"unable to guarantee protestors\' safety\" in 
the event of a rally.  This rare police statement, 
coupled with early press reports that multiple 
plainclothes policemen may have taken part in the 
heckling, have given rise to speculation of GOAM 
involvement (local and/or national) in the anti- 
opposition events on Sunday.  In addition, sources tell 
the Embassy that a suspicious \"violet Mercedes-Benz\" 
was parked close to the rally from which GOAM 
sympathizers distributed eggs and encouraged their 
equities to \"make it look like a real protest from both 
sides.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) It remains unclear what, if any, role 
government authorities played in the March 28 
disturbances during the Gyumri opposition rally. 
Political analysts close to the Embassy speculate that 
the incident had its roots in local politics.  They 
tell us that local authorities may have staged the 
events as a symbol of political repentance in order to 
ingratiate themselves with the Kocharian 
administration.  The subsequent political fallout and 
press frenzy, however, suggest that future rallies will 
now serve as an important barometer of the opposition\'s 
support and the Kocharian administration\'s propensity 
for self-restraint.  Whether the incident was a part of 
local politics or a national power play, all eyes are 
now focused on future opposition rallies in Yerevan and 
what may be the \"hot political spring\" rumored to 
dominate Armenian politics in the coming months.

MIKAEL DANIELYAN 
 
REF:  Golos Armenii Article, 30 March 2004 
 
1. (U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please treat 
accordingly. 
 
2. (SBU) Well-known human rights activist Mikael 
Danielyan contacted the Embassy March 30 after 
reportedly being beaten by four unidentified men near 
the entrance of his home in central Yerevan.  Danielyan 
said the men attacked him from behind when he returned 
from shopping at a neighborhood store.  We met with 
Danielyan hours after the reported incident and 
observed several visible bruises, a large cut on his 
face and evidence of bleeding elsewhere.  Doctors 
placed Danielyan in the neurological unit of Yerevan\'s 
Republican hospital for observation after he sustained 
what was described as a \"possible mild concussion.\" 
Danielyan said the attackers did not take his money, 
jewelry or recently purchased groceries. 
 
3. (SBU) Danielyan said that GOAM authorities responded 
to his complaints and took his police report from the 
hospital.  In addition, representatives from the office 
of newly-appointed Human Rights Ombudsman Larissa 
Alaverdian met with Danielyan immediately following the 
incident.  According to Danielyan\'s wife, Armenia\'s 
\"Kentron\" television station interviewed neighbors and 
identified a handful of witnesses who agreed to make on- 
the-record statements about the incident in a 
television spot which would be aired the evening of 
March 30. 
 
4. (SBU) Danielyan claimed that his attackers did not 
speak to him during the incident but nonetheless he 
characterized the event as a \"definite warning.\" 
Danielyan told us that he believes that the incident 
was a reaction to his March 27 interview with 
Azerbaijan\'s \"Echo\" newspaper.  (Note:  During the 
interview in question, Danielyan postulated that local 
Armenian authorities were so threatened by the planned 
rallies of opposition leaders that they were willing to 
escalate military operations connected to the Nagorono- 
Karabakh conflict in order to divert public attention 
and transport significant numbers of young people away 
from the capital city.  End Note.) 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) No stranger to controversy and frequently a 
figure at the center of a number of high-profile human 
rights cases, Danielyan\'s recent comments to 
Azerbaijan\'s \"Echo\" newspaper have attracted 
uncharateristically volatile attention from local 
Armenian media over the past three days.  The 
influential and widely-read Russian-language bi-weekly 
\"Golos Armenii\" (\"Voice of Armenia\") ran a front-page 
article March 30 saying his remarks were unpatriotic 
and that Danielyan\'s sympathies lay with the Azeris 
(ref).  While we have no information regarding what 
group or groups were behind his beating, there is no 
shortage of groups that might take offense at his 
comments as reported.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) The government shuffled a number of key high- 
and mid-level executive and judicial appointments in 
late March, placing Kocharian loyalists in the majority 
of the spots.  Some of the most important moves 
included the appointment of a new regional governor in 
Armenia\'s southern Syunik province, several judges, and 
a range of mid-level police officials.  The changes 
also affected three governmental positions, the chiefs 
of the State Committee on Water Management, State 
Property Management and Emergency Management.  Some 
analysts point to the reshuffle as Kocharian\'s latest 
move to strengthen GOAM offices with loyalists in 
advance of the opposition\'s planned \"hot political 
spring\" rallies and demonstrations.  Others, however, 
view the appointments simply as the inevitable payoff 
for supporting Kocharian during the 2003 Presidential 
elections. 
 
-------------------------- 
CHANGES IN SYUNIK PROVINCE 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The government named Suren Khachatrian, (aka 
\"Liska\") as the new governor of Armenia\'s southern 
Syunik province.  Khachatrian, a 47-year-old former 
auto mechanic and two-term parliamentarian, has close 
ties with the Prime Minister\'s Republican Party.  He 
gained political prominence during Armenian military 
actions in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1992-94, when he served 
as a commander of paramilitary and army units in his 
native town of Goris.  Since then the Khachatrian 
family has gained control over the local Syunik 
administration and a host of businesses.  Some claim 
that the Khachatrian family considers the province to 
be their de facto personal fiefdom. 
 
4. (SBU) Media reports have linked Khachatrian to 
violent incidents reported in Goris since 1996.  The 
most recent rumor involved Khachatrian\'s two nephews, 
who are currently facing criminal charges for murdering 
a local man in early March.  With this new appointment, 
\"Liska\" will give up his parliamentary mandate.  (Note: 
An opposition newspaper recently suggested a campaign 
to nominate \"Liska\" to the Guinness Book of World 
Records for \"not uttering a single word during his 
eight years in parliament.\"  End Note.)  The Central 
Election Commission (CEC) will announce the date of the 
parliamentary by-election in Goris in early April. 
 
------------------------------------ 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL CHANGES 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) The Kocharian administration announced the 
dismissal of eight judges and four procurators (most of 
whom serve in communities in Yerevan) in late March. 
Almost simultaneously the government unveiled a plan to 
reshuffle the mid-level ranks of the National Police 
force.  These moves followed the replacement of the 
Procurator General by his most influential deputy, 
Aghvan Hovsepian, on March 17 (ref A).  Most of the 
newly appointed judicial and law enforcement officials 
have ties to Kocharian.  (Note:  Some of the new 
judicial appointees were in charge of criminal 
investigation of the October 27, 1999 shootings in the 
Armenian National Assembly.  End Note.) 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
CONTROVERSIAL REMOVAL OF CHIEF WATER MANAGER 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Prime Minister Andranik Margarian removed 
Gagik Martirosian as the Head of the State Committee on 
Water Management, and appointed him as an advisor in 
the Prime Minister\'s office on March 23.  (Note:  this 
new position is little more than a ceremonial function, 
and represents a clear demotion in terms of influence 
within the government.  End Note.)  Martirosian, a 
former Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, enjoyed a 
reputation as one of the most able professionals in the 
GOAM thanks to improvements in Yerevan\'s water supply 
and fee-collections for water-related services.  He 
faced sharp criticism, however, during a recent 
government tour of rural areas over the GOAM\'s 
irrigation policy.  Members of both the opposition and 
the ARF Dashnaktsutyun (part of the governing 
coalition) party decried the decision to replace him. 
They claimed the move was retribution for Martirosian\'s 
recent criticism of certain local government leaders as 
\"corrupt and deficient.\"  Some speculate that pointing 
to his failure to garner GOAM support during the rural 
visits was merely a ruse to facilitate his removal and 
replace him with a more compliant Kocharian supporter. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION, CHIEF OF STATE PROPERTY 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7. (SBU) Former chairman of Armenia\'s Central Election 
Commission (CEC) Artak Sahradian was named Deputy 
Minister of Education on March 15, nearly a year after 
he left his earlier post in the CEC following the 2003 
presidential and parliamentary elections.  Some 
analysts speculate that Sahradian\'s \"second coming\" as 
deputy minister was a long-awaited reward for his 
\"exemplary behavior\" during the 2003 elections.  Almost 
simultaneously, former Prime Minsterial Deputy Chief of 
Staff Karine Kirakossian replaced David Vardanian as 
the Chief of Armenia\'s Committee of State Property 
Management (an agency responsible for privatization 
programs in the country).  Even the opposition has 
praised Kirakossian, the least closely tied to 
Kocharian, as a good choice for the privatization 
posting owing to her professionalism and experience. 
 
-------------------- 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT 
-------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) The government appointed another Kocharian 
loyalist and former Governor of Syunik province Edward 
Barseghian to head the Emergency Management Department. 
A former chief of traffic police, Barseghian governed 
Syunik province for six years, from 1998 to 2004, and 
his province boasted the highest vote cast for 
Kocharian in both the 1998 and 2003 presidential 
elections. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (SBU) Appointing Kocharian loyalists to these 
judicial and administrative postings is interesting if 
only because of the reshuffle\'s timing.  None of these 
slots was scheduled for a personnel change nor were 
there any apparent problems with the way the incumbents 
were handling their jobs.  With Kocharian adopting a 
more defensive posture in advance of what the 
opposition predicts will be a \"Hot Political Spring\" 
(ref B), these appointments appear to be carefully 
synchronized and designed to strengthen the president\'s 
ranks as Armenia moves into an unpredictable April.

SUBJECT:  MAINTAINING DEMINING OPERATIONS IN ARMENIA 
 
1. (U) Post is concerned about the future of USG- 
supported demining operations in Armenia.  Funding is 
running out, and we run the risk of losing this high 
value, high impact program.  We ask for the 
Department\'s cooperation in finding a way to maintain 
the demining program in Armenia. 
 
2. (SBU) The USG\'s humanitarian demining program, 
implemented in Armenia through Ronco, is a high-level 
success story for post.  One of the most visible parts 
of our security cooperation in Armenia, the program 
also commands the keen interest of the Diaspora 
community.  By not finding an immediate, creative 
solution to keep the minimum Ronco staff on the ground 
here in Armenia, we risk losing a valuable program with 
multiple years of in-country training and an excellent 
working relationship with GOAM officials. 
 
3. (SBU) The demining program improved dramatically in 
2003 under the new Ronco Chief of Party.  He possesses 
the negotiating skills and understanding of cultural 
nuances to effectively work with local authorities on a 
range of sensitive issues.  The knowledge he has 
obtained and the relationships he has created are 
invaluable resources that would require months -- if 
not years -- to replicate.  If we can build upon the 
progress made last year with the help of the Ronco 
Chief of Party, the Armenian Humanitarian Demining 
program will be in an excellent position to be self- 
sustaining in the near future. 
 
4. (SBU) Spring puts us right in the middle of the most 
productive part of the demining year in Armenia.  If we 
allow funding to run out and if Ronco pulls its staff 
at this point, we will have wasted a significant part 
of our mine clearing capabilities for 2004.  Post is 
coordinating with EUR/ACE to get USD 1.2 million to 
Ronco to fund demining for the next year.  Part of this 
funding came from FY \'03 Performance funds and part 
will come out of Armenia\'s FY \'04 FSA budget.  We 
recognize that bureaucratic realities make it difficult 
to transfer funds immediately, and therefore ask that 
the \"bridge\" funds (estimated by Ronco staff on the 
ground at USD 67,350 to keep the program running from 
April to June) be identified from whatever office as 
soon as possible. 
 
5. (SBU) Ronco has told us that this \"bridge\" funding 
of USD 67,350 would provide the following for the 
period of April-June 2004: 
--Chief of Party and advisors 
--Full demining company deployment 
--Housing, maintenance and training for 19 demining 
dogs 
--Support staff and administrative resources (reduced) 
 
6. (SBU) Ronco estimates that USD 22,450 of this 
\"bridge\" funding would be allocated per month as 
follows: 
--Ronco salaries:  USD 5,640 
--Phone bills:  USD 600 
--Rent for Ronco facilities:  USD 4,850 
--Field stipends:  USD 4,600 
--Supplies:  USD 2,400 
--Local staff salaries:  USD 2,500 
--Vehicle maintenance:  USD 1,600 
--Administrative costs:  USD 260 
 
7. (U) These amounts represent a small investment for a 
high-impact element of our Post\'s assistance projects. 
Post thanks the Department in advance for its help and 
asks that relevant offices keep us informed as 
discussions continue.

2. (SBU) The Armenian National Assembly ratified the 
NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) Status of Forces 
Agreement (SOFA) March 31.  The GOAM signed the 
agreement on October 28, 2003.  Under Armenian law, the 
agreement goes into effect with no further Presidential 
action necessary.  In a meeting with us today, Defense 
Minister Serge Sargsyan noted that the SOFA 
ratification was an important step for Armenia\'s 
increased cooperation with NATO and further 
participation in PfP activities. 
 
3. (SBU) Comment:  The GOAM clearly considers the 
signing and ratification of the SOFA agreement as a 
significant step towards strengthening its defense 
cooperation ties with NATO and the United States. 
Along with the SOFA ratification, Armenia hosted the 
Cooperative Best Effort 03 exercises in June 2003 and 
deployed peacekeepers to NATO\'s KFOR operation in 
Kosovo, and MOD sources told us March 30 that they are 
on track to ratify the Acquisition Cross-Servicing 
Agreement (ACSA) as well. 
 
4. (SBU) Despite the recent murder of an Armenian 
officer at a PfP training program in Budapest and the 
continued dispute with Azerbaijan over Armenia\'s level 
of attendance at the Cooperate Best Effort 04 
exercises, both the MFA and MOD have maintained that 
Armenia is intent on further integrating into Euro- 
Atlantic security structures.  The GOAM insists that 
there is no contradiction in Armenia\'s foreign and 
security policies, as the country can maintain strong 
defense relations with Russia while enhancing its 
cooperation with NATO.  The signing and ratification of 
the NATO PfP SOFA signals continued willingness, 
according to Deputy Foreign Minister Tatul Margarian, 
to take Armenia\'s relations with NATO from \"zero to 
respected partner.\"

SUBJECT: REACTION FROM YEREVAN, ARMENIA: AFTER THE 
VISIT OF DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE RICHARD ARMITAGE 
 
1.  SUMMARY: After the visit of Deputy Secretary of 
State Richard Armitage to Armenia all mass media widely 
covered his meetings and press conference held in 
Yerevan.  Following his visit to Azerbaijan, some 
Armenian newspapers published editorials discussing the 
Armitage visit to the region and U.S. interests in the 
region in general.  The following is the summary of 
those articles. END SUMMARY 
 
ARMITAGE AVOIDED MEETING WITH ARMENIAN OPPOSITION 
 
2. Radical oppositionist Armenian language newspaper of 
the \"Constitutional Right\" Union IRAVUNK (03/30) 
discusses the Armitage visit in the light of U.S 
interests and concern regarding the countries he 
visited as opposed to Russia\'s interests in the same 
countries.  \"The signs of a clash between two 
superpowers are becoming obvious in Ukraine, Armenia 
and Azerbaijan.  The visit of Deputy Secretary of State 
Richard Armitage to these countries should probably be 
viewed in this light.  In the elections to be held in 
Ukraine in October Moscow and Washington are supporting 
leaders from two opposite fronts.\"  \"The confrontation 
will become more severe in the countries of the 
Caucasus region, which will acquire the status of a 
transit zone for the upcoming ten to fifteen years. 
The main arena for this confrontation will be our 
region, then Central Asia.  The main obstacle for the 
implementation of western programs is the lack of 
settlement of certain ethnic problems in the South 
Caucasus.  According to experts in Russia and in the 
West, this primarily refers to the Karabakh conflict, 
which is the reason for the failure of several 
geopolitical programs to be implemented in the region. 
According to certain information, currently being 
checked, this was the reason for the Armitage visit to 
the South Caucasus, where he wanted to meet with the 
leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan and find out about 
their inclination and their willingness for a quick 
resolution of the conflict.  According to the same 
sources, Richard Armitage was very satisfied with the 
position of official Yerevan, while strongly displeased 
with the destructive position of Ilham Aliyev. 
Observers believe that this was the reason why Armitage 
held meetings with the Azeri opposition while he 
avoided meeting with the Armenian opposition.\" 
 
WASHINGTON UNHAPPY WITH AZERI STATEMENTS ON KARABAKH 
 
3. Pro-government GOLOS ARMENII (03/30) published a 
front-page article discussing possible reasons for the 
Armitage visit to the region.  \"Deputy Secretary 
Richard Armitage arrived in Baku on the 26th of March 
immediately after his official visit to Yerevan. 
However, until March 29 there were very few reports 
from Baku covering the visit of the high-ranking 
official from the White House.  Furthermore, it was 
noted that of the three capitals visited by Armitage at 
the end of March - Kiev, Yerevan, Baku - Baku was the 
one with the highest priority.  It should be noted that 
regional visits of this category involving high-ranking 
officials such as Richard Armitage do not happen very 
often.  Usually this means that, given the expected 
developments, Washington prefers to get first hand 
information from the region despite the fact that U.S. 
Embassies in the countries concerned are providing the 
Administration with relevant information.  The last 
visit of a U.S. Deputy Secretary to Armenian was in 
1999. Then-Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott visited 
Armenia because at that time it seemed that there were 
real opportunities for resolution of the Karabakh 
conflict.  We think that now things stand differently. 
Prior to the visit of R. Armitage Assistant Secretary 
Elizabeth Jones mentioned that the Karabakh issue would 
be the cornerstone of the talks, and then she made a 
minor but very essential addition:  `Official 
Washington is interested in knowing what the priorities 
of the new president and the government of Azerbaijan 
are\'.\"   \"Apparently the White House is not happy with 
recent statements by Ilham Aliyev, which to some extent 
are disturbing for the international community.\"

AGAINST TRAFFIC POLICE, ARMENIA\'S RESIDENTS ARE PICKING 
THEIR OWN LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS AND PAYING HANDSOMELY FOR 
THEM.  FLASHY NUMBER PLATES HAVE BECOME DE RIGUEUR FOR 
YEREVAN\'S FLASHY CARS, AND IDENTIFY RELATIVES AND CLOSE 
ASSOCIATES OF ARMENIA\'S TYCOONS.  AS EVEN THE MIDDLE CLASSES 
CANNOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO PICK THEIR OWN LUCKY

ROYAL FLUSH: THE HIERARCHY OF NUMBERS 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) PERHAPS THE PRESIDENT STARTED IT ALL WITH 001 UU 
01, BUT THE DESIRABILITY FOR LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS BEARING 
DOUBLE ZEROS AND REPEATING NUMBERS HAS CAUGHT ON.  LONG A 
STANDARD PRACTICE IN ARMENIA FOR OFFICIAL CARS--THE DEFENSE 
MINISTER\'S MERCEDES BEARS 002 UU 02, THE SPEAKER OF 
PARLIAMENT\'S, 001 OO 01, AND THE PRIME MINISTER\'S 001 LL 01- 
-ARMENIA\'S OLIGARCHS HAVE ADOPTED THE SAME PATTERNS FOR 
THEIR PRIVATE CARS.  THANKS TO THE ENTERPRISING SPIRIT OF 
THE HEADS OF MUNICIPAL TRAFFIC POLICE, WELL-OFF ARMENIANS 
HAVE ESTABLISHED FAMILY NUMBERS--PATTERNS AND NUMBERS THAT 
IDENTIFY THEM AND THEIR CLOSE ASSOCIATES.  IN MANY CASES 
OLIGARCHS HAVE PURCHASED EXCLUSIVE USE OF ALL THE DOUBLE- 
ZERO PLATES AVAILABLE WITH THEIR CHOSEN NUMBER (THAT IS, 
WITH ALL THE POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS FOR THE TWO LETTERS IN 
THE MIDDLE) FOR THE CARS OF THEIR FAMILY, STAFF AND FRIENDS.

FOUR HUMMERS: A THEME AND VARIATION

4. (SBU) THE FLAGSHIPS OF YEREVAN\'S HIERARCHY OF NUMBERS ARE 
YEREVAN\'S LARGEST AND MOST CONSPICUOUS AUTOMOBILES: THE FOUR 
HUMMER HUMVEES.  GAGIK TSAROUKIAN (DODI GAGO), OWNER OF 
MULTI GROUP AND YEREVAN\'S FIRST HUMMER (AND NOW ALSO, 
YEREVAN\'S FIRST ROLLS ROYCE) HAS DE FACTO EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS 
TO THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES USING 08 XX 008 (XX

THE OWNER IS FRIENDS OR FAMILY WITH GYUMRI\'S MINISTER OF 
PARLIAMENT.  MIDDLE CLASS CITIZENS ARE PAYING MORE MODEST 
SUMS FOR LESS PRESTIGIOUS PLATES--THAT IS, THOSE WITH 
MISMATCHED NUMBERS OR WITHOUT THE TWO ZEROS.  A LADA NIVA 
FOR SALE AT A YEREVAN CAR MARKET WITH LICENSE PLATE 08 LT 
009 COSTS USD 3,000 WITHOUT PLATES, USD 4,500 WITH.  THE

SAFETY IN NUMBERS

6. (SBU) BESIDES THE BENEFITS OF VANITY AND PRESTIGE, LUCKY 
NUMBER PLATES BRING IMMUNITY FROM HARASSMENT BY THE TRAFFIC 
POLICE.  BECAUSE SPECIAL PLATES SIGNIFY A SPECIAL 
RELATIONSHIP--FIDUCIARY OR OTHERWISE--WITH THE HEAD OF 
TRAFFIC POLICE, THE STREET POLICE ARE UNDERSTANDABLY 
RELUCTANT TO STOP CARS BEARING CUSTOM NUMBERS.  WHILE A 
BRAZEN TRAFFIC COP MIGHT NEVERTHELESS STOP A CAR BEARING THE 
SIMPLE 12 XX 123 (WHICH SIGNALS, AFTER ALL, LITTLE 
CONNECTION AND A WILLINGNESS TO PAY PETTY BRIBES), A PLATE 
BEARING, FOR EXAMPLE, 05 XX 555 (BELONGING TO MANVEL 
GRIGORIAN, THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE, FORMER TRUCK 
DRIVER AND KARABAKH WAR HERO, ONCE ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING 
KICKBACKS FROM PUBLIC UTILITIES IN ECHMIADZIN) IS \"AS GOOD 
AS RED [DIPLOMATIC] PLATES\" SAYS AN EMBASSY DRIVER AND 
FORMER TRAFFIC POLICE OFFICER. 
 
----------------------------- 
COMMENT: A LITTLE MORE EQUAL? 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) EVEN THOSE ARMENIANS WHO ARE UNWILLING TO PAY FOR 
CUSTOM LICENSE NUMBERS ARE SURPRISINGLY WILLING TO ACCEPT 
THE PRACTICE AS LEGITIMATE.  IT IS NOT PERCEIVED AS REAL 
CORRUPTION, NOTED THE EMBASSY FRAUD INVESTIGATOR, BECAUSE 
ANYONE CAN RECEIVE A NORMAL (RANDOM) LICENSE PLATE WITHOUT 
PAYING A FACILITATION FEE AND, OF COURSE, ALL PRIVATE 
NUMBERS TECHNICALLY HAVE THE SAME LEGAL STATUS.  PERHAPS 
ARMENIANS ARE SO KEEN TO ACCEPT (AND SUPPORT) THE SYSTEM 
BECAUSE IT SIMPLY ADDS CLARITY TO FAMILIAR SYSTEMS OF 
NEPOTISM AND FAVORITISM.  AT LEAST YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHO\'S 
CUTTING IN FRONT OF YOU...

SUBJECT: \"To enter the 21st century or not?\" - PAS 
Yerevan hosts International Women\'s Forum. 
 
1.  SUMMARY: On March 21, the PAS Yerevan organized a 
highly successful forum in honor of International 
Women\'s Month, featuring prominent women working in the 
fields of international affairs, politics, business, 
media and law.  The event drew capacity crowds and was 
covered by three television stations and at least five 
print media.  PAS has received much positive feedback 
from the participants, who praised the embassy for 
organizing a unique event that addressed the critical 
and sensitive issue of gender in Armenia.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  In honor of International Women\'s Month, PAS 
organized a day long \"International Women\'s Forum\" at 
the American University of Armenia\'s Business Center. 
Leading women working in the fields of international 
affairs, politics, business, media and law were invited 
to make presentations based on their personal 
experiences, take questions and engage in discussion 
with the audience.  PAS advertised the forum through 
alumni, university and NGO listserves and bulletin 
boards and was overwhelmed with more than 200 RSVPs, a 
rare occurrence in Armenia.  At the opening of the 
forum, the hall was over capacity.  Many of the 
participants, who were about 90 percent female, 
traveled from the far regions of Armenia to attend. 
 
3.  Several high-level women took part in the forum. 
The first panel was dedicated to women working in 
international affairs and included the U.S. Charge d\' 
Affaires, the British Ambassador and the Turkey Desk 
Officer from the Armenian MFA.  The Charge opened the 
forum by excerpting Secretary Powell\'s Message on 
International Women\'s Month, highlighting the 
Department of State\'s commitment to human rights and 
called on those present to consider that each and every 
woman, no matter how modest, has a contribution to make 
in influencing and inspiring future generations.  The 
British Ambassador pointed out the connection between 
gender equality and poverty and gave her ideas about 
ways to promote equality on an individual level.  The 
Turkey Desk Officer shared several interesting 
statistics about Armenian women working in the MFA; 
women account for 28 percent of Armenian diplomats and 
are primarily serving at the mid-level, there are 
currently three women Ambassadors and women face great 
difficulty in securing overseas assignments where most 
Ambassadors prefer an all-male staff. 
 
4. The women in politics panel featured Lydumila 
Harutyunyan, head of the independent, non-aligned 
Dignity Party, Hranush Hakobyan, a prominent Member of 
Parliament, and an Armenian-American professor of 
political science. Their presentations generated a 
lively debate about the need to raise and enforce an 
existing quota (currently 5 percent) on female 
representation in Parliament, the need for women to 
test their cultural boundaries and get more involved in 
politics and the role of NGOs (which are primarily 
dominated by women in Armenia) as incubators for 
political activists. Harutyunyan exhorted the women in 
the audience to take control and define their own role 
in society, ending the panel with the question: \"Are we 
going to enter the 21st century or not?\" 
 
5. After lunch, the President of the National Press 
Club and the director of InterNews, an NGO that 
promotes media development, shared their opinion that 
current media programming in Armenia does not serve 
women\'s interests, prompting a discussion with the 
audience on whether or not media outlets should develop 
special content for women, with the majority of the 
audience opposed to softer subject matter and instead 
calling for programming that addresses gender issues 
and promotes equality. 
 
6. A lieutenant colonel in the police, a litigation 
attorney, an assistant community prosecutor, a lawyer 
specializing in international human rights law and the 
head of the International Affairs Department in the 
Prosecutor General\'s office made up the women in law 
panel and shared their particularly interesting 
viewpoints as women in a line of work overwhelmingly 
dominated by men in Armenia.  They shared their own 
success stories and asserted that there are 
increasingly more opportunities for women in this 
field. Most were quite young in age and their positive 
outlook was very inspiring for the audience. 
 
7.  The final panel was devoted to women in business. 
The director of an international business training 
center stressed the importance of getting a solid 
foundation in business practices and law.  The owner of 
a popular caf and bookstore shared her humorous wisdom 
on the challenges to women who want to start businesses 
in Armenia, noting that everyone must make the choice 
to either \"stay under the blanket and sleep or get an 
education and do their best!\" 
 
8. COMMENT: This event was a great success. Hundreds of 
women from universities, NGOs, businesses and the 
government were given the opportunity to hear success 
stories, exchange wisdom on overcoming the strong 
gender discrimination that exists in Armenian culture 
and frankly discuss opportunities and challenges to 
women in Armenia.  Participants told us that this was 
the largest such meeting on women\'s issues in Armenia 
in years and PAS received multiple expressions of 
appreciation for organizing it.  The event generated 
significant and positive press exposure as three 
television stations and at least five print media 
covered the event over several days.  The program 
effectively and publicly demonstrated the United 
States\' commitment to promoting gender equality and 
human rights.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: REACTION FROM YEREVAN, ARMENIA: PRESS 
CONFERENCE BY MAJOR GENERAL JEFFERY KOHLER 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: Major General Jeffery Kohler, the Director 
of Plans and Policy for the U.S. European Command, paid 
a two-day visit to Armenia on March 30-31.  Immediately 
before departure he gave a press conference, with more 
than twenty media outlets participating.  The TV 
reports were mainly factual, while papers carried some 
editorials.  In general the reaction of the media to 
the press conference was positive.  The following is 
the summary of the articles.  END SUMMARY 
 
THE UNITED STATES WILL RESTORE SANCTIONS 
IF THERE IS MILITARY ACTION ON THE BORDER 
 
2. Opposition newspaper ARAVOT (04/01) published a 
mainly factual report on the press conference.  \"As to 
the murder of the Armenian officer in Budapest, Mr. 
Kohler refrained from commenting on the question and 
left it to the Hungarian authorities.\"  \"Jeffrey Kohler 
stated with special emphasis that the program 
[Partnership for Peace] consists of two main words - 
partnership and peace.\" 
 
WHY DID THE GENERAL COME 
 
3. Opposition newspaper HAYKAKAN ZHAMANAK (04/01) 
focused on the sanctions that the U.S. might use should 
there be a resumption of military action on the contact 
line between Karabakh and Azerbaijan.  \"By saying 
sanctions he meant the block on U.S. military support 
provided to Armenia and Azerbaijan, which was lifted 
two years ago.  The answer by the Major General was 
given in relation to the recent statement Deputy 
Secretary of State Richard Armitage made two days ago 
 
SIPDIS 
in Baku.  According to the Azeri press, the Deputy 
Secretary of State expressed concern over the delay in 
 
SIPDIS 
the resolution of the Karabakh conflict and, 
underlining the recent clashes that took place in 
Kosovo, said that in the current situation there might 
also be military action on the border of Karabakh.   In 
this case it was very important that Major General 
Jeffery Kohler, the Director of Plans and Policy for 
the U.S. European Command, did not try to refute the 
possibility of military action on the border of 
Karabakh.  He just pointed out that the policy of the 
U.S. government regarding the Karabakh conflict is that 
it should be resolved by peaceful means.\"  \"It could be 
assumed from the General\'s words that, should military 
action start up again on the Karabakh border line, the 
conflicting sides would have to forget about 
cooperation with the U.S., especially the side that 
starts the conflict.\" 
 
ARMENIANS CAN BE PROUD OF THEIR PEACEKEEPERS 
 
4. Dashnak-affiliated HAYOTS ASHKHAR daily (04/01) \"It 
is not clear why J. Kohler avoided speaking about the 
murder of the Armenian lieutenant, leaving the answer 
to the Hungarian officials. He spoke more distinctly on 
the issue of changing the venue for the \"Cooperative 
Best Effort - 2004\" exercises, which are expected to be 
held in Azerbaijan. The Major General stressed that the 
issue is not within the competence of the U.S. European 
Command, noting this issue belongs to NATO. It is to be 
mentioned that Major General Jeffery Kohler, the 
Director of Plans and Policy for the U.S. European 
Command, was saying that he has no direct relation to 
NATO-related issues.  We would like to draw attention 
to this fact, taking into account a recent publication 
in one of the local papers with its `deep and serious\' 
analysis saying that it can be concluded that Kohler\'s 
visit to Armenia is connected with Armenia\'s membership 
in NATO and certain guarantees that need to be heard 
from the Armenian side.  However, it is obvious that 
even if it were necessary to address such topics, the 
Armenian authorities would not talk to J. Kohler about 
any NATO-related issues.  It has been frequently 
mentioned at the highest levels that Armenia is simply 
cooperating with NATO within the Partnership for Peace 
program and has no intention to join that 
organization.\"  \"Judging from everything he said it can 
be assumed that Jeffrey Kohler liked Armenia.\"

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Per Ref A, and in the effort to promote 
counterterrorism cooperation (Ref B), Post hosted a follow-up 
meeting of the in-country Counterterrorism Action Group, 
April 1, 2004, comprising representatives from the French, 
German, Italian, British and Russian Embassies.  Post invited 
Deputy Minister of Finance and Economy David Avetisian to 
speak about Armenia,s recent efforts to implement safeguards 
against terrorist financing.  Avetisian confirmed that 
Armenia has ratified the International Convention on the 
Suppression of Terrorist Financing (as reported previously 
ref B).  He conceded, however, that Armenia is still in the 
process of developing an action plan to implement the legal 
reforms for which the treaty calls.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
LAW ON TERRORIST FINANCE STILL IN DRAFT FORM 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenia has not yet passed a long-standing draft 
bill On Prevention of Illegally Received Income Legalization 
and Terrorist Financing, which Avetisian considers the first 
step in discharging Armenia,s duties under the Convention. 
Although Armenia has no special article in the Criminal Code 
for the financing of Terrorism, it does have various 
provisions of criminal and civil law that allow it to 
prosecute acts of terrorist financing and freeze accounts of 
suspected terrorist organizations.  Avetisian said that he 
looks forward to the passing of the draft bill as an 
opportunity to consolidate the government,s legal regime 
governing money laundering and terrorist finance and to 
establish a unified system of investigation and oversight of 
financial transactions.  He pointed out that their system is 
still in flux and that foreign technical assistance may be 
justified to help them create an enforcement regime up to 
international standards. 
 
----------------------------- 
NOT YET CLEAR WHO\'S IN CHARGE 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) According to Avetisian, it is not yet clear which 
government entity will be responsible for implementing the 
reforms in the Convention.  Avetisian noted that currently 
the lead for meeting Armenia,s obligations under the 
Convention rests with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
although the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) plays an 
active cooperative role.  (Note:  Avetissian insisted that 
the MFE is the \"heart and head\" of GOAM efforts against 
terrorist financing.  End Note.)  He added that the 
Convention was ratified very quickly but that the government 
has not yet put together an action plan to implement its 
obligations.  The Central Bank and the National Security 
Service share responsibility for implementing Armenia,s 
current efforts to guard against terrorist financing.  The 
Central Bank oversees the reporting and investigation 
obligations of private banks, and circulates lists of names 
of individuals associated with terrorist organizations.  The 
National Security Service tracks any suspected terrorist 
activity in the country.  When asked under which entity a 
Financial Intelligence Unit, to be formed under the new law, 
might be rest in the future, Mr. Avetisian dodged the 
question, adding only that the Ministry of Finance and 
Economy is a policy making body, and noting that the Central 
Bank is not, technically, part of Government.  (Note: 
Avetisian told us on a previous occasion that the Ministry of 
Finance and the Central Bank submitted competing draft laws 
on money laundering, each putting a financial intelligence 
and oversight unit under the supervision of their respective 
entities.  End Note.) 
 
---------------------------------------- 
ARMENIA DOES NOT POSE A BIG THREAT...YET 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Avetisian stated that there have been no prosecutions 
or asset freezes in Armenia related to terrorist financing. 
He pointed out that Armenia is not a major financial center, 
but added that its financial system is maturing and strong 
protections are necessary to prevent Armenia from becoming an 
attractive option for money launderers and terrorist 
financiers.  He noted as an example Armenia,s casinos, which 
are weakly regulated.  (Note:  Avetisian oversees the agency 
charged with regulating gambling.  End Note.)   He claimed 
that casinos posed a small threat as venues for money 
laundering today (because there is no real need to legitimize 
cash in Armenia, a cash economy), but that in the event that 
offshore casinos begin to operate in Armenia, the regulatory 
framework will need to be improved in order to scotch 
opportunities for would-be terrorist financiers and money 
launderers. 
--------------------------------------------- 
RUSSIAN POLITICAL COUNSELOR LAUDS COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Russian Political Counselor Oleg Korobkov highlighted 
the close cooperation between Russia and the U.S. on 
counterterrorism matters, and proposed building on what he 
described as the \"already fully successful model\" for 
cooperating on issues of non-proliferation as the best way to 
structure our joint counterterrorism efforts.  (Note:  It was 
not clear whether he was speaking on instructions; while in 
previous CTAG meetings he has come with written notes from 
which to work, in this case his comments appeared more 
spontaneous.  End Note.)  He stressed that Russia did not see 
Armenia as a particular threat with regards to terrorism, and 
told us of an incident that supposedly took place roughly ten 
years ago, when a group of Chechen activists attempted to use 
Armenia as a staging ground for operations in Chechnya. 
Korobkov noted that the \"terrorists were immediately obvious\" 
and arrested by Armenian authorities, and turned over to the 
Russian government within a few days.  (Note:  We cannot 
corroborate his comments, but they appear plausible.  End 
Note.)  Russian-Armenian counterterrorism cooperation is 
strong, according to Korobkov. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
CONCLUSION AND COMMENT: ARMENIA KEEN TO COOPERATE 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
6. (SBU) Avetisian was keen to hear support for stronger laws 
against terrorist finance.  He mentioned that the Armenian 
National Security Service would appreciate more information 
on those individuals designated as relating to terrorist 
organizations, and that this information would facilitate 
their investigations.  The French representative, DCM Gilles 
Courregelongue promised that such intelligence cooperation 
was possible and that if the National Security Service made a 
request he would be happy to facilitate cooperation with the 
appropriate body in Paris.  Avetisian concluded by saying 
that he would write a letter to the prime minister about this 
meeting, both expressing the groups interest in Terrorist 
Finance issues and possible areas for cooperation in the 
future.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (S) Emboff visited the Armenian Institute of Applied 
Chemistry (ARIAC) for an update on its activities.  The 
chemical institute is going strong, boasting about USD 
270,000 in export sales and USD 50,000 in domestic sales of 
chemical compounds in 2003.  ARIAC\'s client base includes 
companies from Japan, the United States, Canada, Europe, 
Egypt and Jordan.  AIRAC anticipated an approximate 80 
percent growth in 2004.  ARIAC officials claim to adhere to 
international guidelines concerning the export of dual use 
chemicals.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
ARIAC SOON TO PRIVATIZE 
----------------------- 
 
2. (S) ARIAC director Gagik Hasratyan claimed that the 
company will soon privatize, noting that ARIAC receives no 
government funding and relies totally on sales of its 
chemical compounds to various international and domestic 
clients.  Hasratyan told us that technically the Government 
of Armenia (GOAM) still owns AIARC but that the financial 
relationship ended in 1994.  Hasratyan hoped that by the end 
of 2004 ARIAC would be fully privatized and then could 
entertain international investment opportunities and possibly 
a public stock offering.  ARIAC had some investment interest 
from Jordanian and Israeli companies but Hasratyan plans to 
hold off on any serious discussion until the privatization 
process is completed. 
 
3. (S) ARIAC has approximately 77 employees of which about 39 
are technical specialists.  Hasratyan said that he wanted to 
expand and was looking for at least 10 more good chemists. 
Salaries were approximately USD 200 a month plus bonuses, 
which Hasratyan felt was competitive for Armenia.  Hasratyan 
showed us ARIAC\'s web site, WWW.ARIAC.CO.UK., an ARIAC color 
catalog and an export products list which showed the chemical 
compounds for sale along with their international 
identification numbers.  Our tour of the ARIAC featured 
working laboratories with Soviet-era equipment.  Hasratyan 
explained that he wanted to buy new equipment, but in the 
meantime his chemists were able to continue to create 
European quality chemical compounds owing to their experience 
and high expertise.  He said that after ARIAC chemists create 
a chemical compound for a client, they then utilize a nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy located at a neighboring 
institute to ensure the quality of the compound.  After 
privatization of ARIAC, Hasratyan also would like to receive 
an international certification to manufacture and sell 
pharmaceutical products. 
 
--------------- 
ARIAC\'S CLIENTS 
--------------- 
 
4. (S) Hasratyan told us that ARIAC had sold compounds to 
well-known trans-national chemical companies to include 
Lancaster, Oldridge, and Sigma for about 25 percent of what 
they in turn were sold on the world market.  ARIAC was also 
currently negotiating an exclusive contract with a Japanese 
company for a long term supply of chemical compounds. 
Hasratyan said that previously he had negotiated with 
Pakistani and Indian chemical companies without any positive 
results.  ARIAC was also interested in buying and selling 
chemicals with Chinese Chemical companies, but Hasratyan 
stated he was cautious as Chinese companies do not have a 
good reputation for reliability and quality. 
 
5. (S) Hasratyan noted candidly that in 1993 his company was 
involved in the sale of a dual use item to a Syrian entity 
which caught the attention of the U.S. government and was 
subsequently stopped.  Hasratyan said that he understood the 
reasoning but lamented that this had cost his company a great 
deal of money and time and wished those concerns had been 
raised by the GOAM before he put money into the sale. 
Hasratyan told us that he has had limited business contact 
with Syrian entities since then.  Hasratyan added that he 
wanted to do business with Iranian chemical companies but has 
been unsuccessful.  He told us that twice in 1994, the 
Iranian government discussed possible projects with ARIAC; 
once ARIAC lost interest, and another time the Iranians 
simply disappeared from the negotiating table.  Hasratyan has 
a current interest in starting a joint venture with an 
Iranian chemical company to produce food preservatives but 
has had little success in moving it forward. 
 
--------------------------------- 
SAFEGUARDS IN EXPORTING CHEMICALS 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (S) When asked about export safeguards, Hasratyan 
explained that ARIAC strictly follows UN guidelines 
concerning dual use chemicals.  Before any sale was 
considered, ARIAC had to submit an application to the GOAM 
for approval.  After receiving GOAM approval, ARIAC exports 
then had a final check by customs before being exported. 
Hasratyan added that since most of his sales were a kilogram 
or less, he generally shipped through an overnight delivery 
company.  Hasratyan\'s only complaint was that the GOAM 
sometimes took too long to approve an export and as a 
consequence ARIAC occasionally lost sales.  Hasratyan also 
said that ARIAC requires its clients to adhere to regulations 
concerning dual use chemicals. On three occasions, he noted, 
European companies had asked for potential dual use chemical 
compounds.  When ARIAC officials asked for the required 
documentation for approval to receive these chemicals, the 
companies never followed up.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Plans by opposition leaders for a \"hot 
political spring\" appeared to gain momentum in late 
March as politicians from both sides raised the level 
of rhetoric and hundreds of supporters gathered for the 
first set of protest rallies in Armenia\'s two largest 
cities.  National Unity Party founder Artashes 
Geghamian\'s announced March 24 that he would join 
Stepan Demirchian and the opposition Justice Bloc in 
its efforts to oust Kocharian.  This union signals the 
most cooperation within the opposition since large- 
scale protests following the 2003 presidential 
election.  The GOAM reacted to opposition plans by 
reinforcing law enforcement and judicial ranks with 
Kocharian loyalists and issuing public statements 
saying that it would not permit sustained unrest or 
plans for extra-constitutional activities.  Despite the 
recent surge of momentum, it remains unlikely that the 
opposition can create a solid platform that will garner 
enough support to unseat President Robert Kocharian. 
Lacking a charismatic leader upon whom a majority of 
Armenians agree, Armenia\'s opposition might stir up the 
political arena and make it uncomfortable for the GOAM, 
but will be hard pressed to replicate a \"Rose 
Revolution\" of their own this Spring.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
NATIONAL UNITY AND JUSTICE BLOC JOIN FORCES 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The alliance of the two largest, and former 
rival, opposition blocs foreshadowed what we expect 
will be large rallies in early April.  Artashes 
Geghamanian, leader of the National Unity Party, 
announced March 24 that he would join the Justice Bloc 
for anti-government protests.  Geghamian and Justice 
Bloc leader Stepan Demirchian announced that their \"Hot 
Spring\" campaign would officially begin with a rally in 
Yerevan April 5, during which they would announce 
future plans and rallies leading to \"the abolishment of 
the illegal regime\" and \"the restoration of 
constitutional order in Armenia.\"  Geghamian had joined 
forces with Demirchian for protests following the 2003 
election, but the two opposition faction leaders had 
seemed increasingly at odds as the year progressed. 
 
---------------------- 
MODEST TURNOUT FOR A1+ 
---------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) In a prelude to \"Hot Spring\" activities, 
several anti-government rallies were held in Yerevan 
and Armenia\'s second largest city, Gyumri, during the 
past two weeks.  A scuffle broke out between police and 
protesters at an opposition rally in Gyumri March 28 
(ref A).  Roughly 300 supporters of embattled 
independent television station A1+ marked the second 
anniversary of the station\'s closing by rallying in 
Yerevan April 2.  The Yerevan City Police permitted the 
rally and accompanying march through Yerevan streets to 
proceed without incident, despite earlier GOAM 
declarations that it was an \"illegal gathering.\" 
(Note:  Rally organizers had failed to secure the 
necessary permit for the gathering.  End Note.) 
 
------------------------ 
USING THE GEORGIAN MODEL 
------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) Both the government and opposition have hinted 
during press interviews and meetings with us that they 
are \"drawing lessons\" from Georgia\'s recent \"Rose 
Revolution\" to guide their activities.  Demirchian and 
Geghamian view Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili\'s 
campaign to unseat former President Shevardnadze as a 
model for their own efforts.  Geghamian and Demirchian 
portray their alliance as a reflection of opposition 
alliances in Georgia prior to Shevardnadze\'s 
resignation.  Opposition leaders have stated in the 
press that the tactics of the Georgian opposition, 
pressuring the government by keeping their supporters 
on the streets in large numbers, can also be employed 
to topple the Kocharian regime.   For their part, the 
Armenian authorities seem intent to not repeat the 
perceived failure of the Shevardnadze regime to prevent 
an extended period of instability during the protests 
that culminated in the Georgian revolution.  In the 
past week, President Kocharian has placed known 
supporters in key administrative and judicial posts 
(ref B), and police officials have intervened in 
opposition rallies in the regions (ref A).

COMMENT

6. (SBU) Despite the recent surge of momentum, it 
remains unlikely that the opposition can create a solid 
platform that will garner enough support to unseat 
President Robert Kocharian.  The Geghamian-Demirchian 
union is at best a marriage of convenience unless they 
can produce an alternative political platform that 
includes solid proposals.  Lacking a charismatic leader 
upon whom a majority of Armenians can agree, the 
opposition might be able to stir up the political arena 
but will be hard pressed to replicate a \"Rose 
Revolution\" of their own this Spring.  Nonetheless, the 
opposition has the capacity to initiate a series of 
embarrassing incidents that could well put the GOAM on 
the defensive, and how the GOAM chooses to respond will 
be critical.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) With few new ideas to present, Armenian 
government and opposition figures stuck to their 
standard positions during a recent series of 
meetings with EUR/CACEN Office Director John Fox. 
Our interlocutors all stressed the importance of the 
bilateral Armenian-U.S. relationship and, depending 
on the degree to which they support or oppose the 
current administration, either saw the situation in 
Armenia on the upswing or veering further into 
economic and democratic malaise.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
PRESIDENT\'S MAN SEES PROGRESS:  A GLASS HALF-FULL 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3. (SBU) Chief Economic Advisor to the President 
Vahram Nercissiantz outlined the progress the 
Armenian economy has made over the past decade as it 
has transitioned to a free market.  Highlighting 
Armenia\'s recent double-digit growth in GDP, 
Nercissiantz cited the dropping poverty rate, 
especially the extreme poverty rate, as a sign that 
Armenia\'s macroeconomic improvement is finally 
bearing fruit for the general population. 
Nercissiantz acknowledged that a large portion of 
Armenia\'s economy is still \"underground,\" noting 
that in \"off-the-record\" conversations with local 
businessmen they admit that their businesses\' 
incomes are considerably higher than what they 
report officially.  With tax collections still only 
at roughly 15 percent of GDP, the GOAM is not in a 
position to implement all the reforms it would like, 
and also unable to fully fund social programs. 
 
------------------------------- 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP ON TRACK 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) As a measure of the strength of the GOAM- 
U.S. bilateral relationship Foreign Minister Vartan 
Oskanian met with Fox late on a Saturday afternoon 
in a relaxed, freewheeling and largely off-the- 
record, exchange.  Earlier in the visit Deputy 
Foreign Minister Ruben Shugarian welcomed Fox and 
noted that our bilateral relationship is generally 
extremely good.  Fox took advantage of the 
opportunity, however, to urge the GOAM to ratify the 
PfP SOFA and Article 98.  (Note:  The National 
Assembly (NA) subsequently ratified the PfP SOFA on 
March 31.  End Note.)  Fox and Shugarian also 
discussed the recent events in Budapest and how they 
might affect Armenia\'s interactions with NATO and 
the PfP. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
THE OPPOSITION SEES DECAY:  A GLASS HALF-EMPTY 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5. (SBU) Former Presidential candidate and National 
Democratic Union (NDU) Chairman Vazgen Manukian met 
with Fox and outlined what he sees as a national 
malaise.  Manukian acknowledged that the opposition 
has no strong figure around whom to rally, but 
described the meetings his party is holding around 
the country.  (Note:  Two regional party leaders had 
just finished briefing Manukian when we arrived in 
his office; he told us that the NDU message 
resonated in the regions.  End Note.)  Fox and 
former Ambassador David Hovhannisian discussed 
regional grass-roots cooperation in a roundtable 
with the Caucasus Forum, a think tank with members 
from 20 Caucasus regions including the North 
Caucasus, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. 
 
---------------------- 
COMMENT:  NO SURPRISES 
---------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Opposition plans for mass demonstrations 
notwithstanding (septel), the political scene in 
Armenia appears basically stable, with broad 
agreement across the political spectrum on the 
importance of the Armenia-U.S. relationship.  Of the 
many interlocutors Fox met during his brief visit, 
none strayed from previously held positions.  With 
no new ideas to offer the public, opposition plans 
for this Spring are not likely to lead to a change 
in government, but the opposition could well put the 
GOAM on the defensive.  How the government chooses 
to respond will be critical.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Completely reversing its previous investment 
policy, Armenia\'s main flag carrier, Armavia Airlines, is 
halting its plans to expand towards Europe and move to 
European standards and is replacing its modern aircraft with 
older Soviet models in an effort to reduce costs.  The move 
is a breach of Armavia\'s agreement with the Government of 
Armenia and is a vote of no confidence in the commercial 
viability of a modern airline servicing European routes from 
Yerevan.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
ARMAVIA AIRLINES REVERSES INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Bob Chaplin, a British consultant who has been 
managing Armavia, told us that Armavia\'s directors have 
decided that the investments necessary to expand Armavia\'s 
service to European cities were not justified. 
Specifically, he said that they were unwilling to accept 
losses in the initial years of investment and preferred to 
pocket the earnings from cheap but profitable point-to-point 
flights in the CIS.  According to Chaplin, for the moment 
Armavia will continue to operate its current European 
flights to Frankfurt and Amsterdam in order to avoid 
forfeiting its exclusive licenses to the routes, for which 
the company paid USD 14.5 million.  Chaplin noted that these 
routes will remain profitable through summer, but after that 
he expects that Armavia will probably try to sell the 
licenses or liquidate during next winter. 
 
--------------------- 
GETTING OUT OF EUROPE 
--------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The sudden reorganization of Armavia\'s assets 
signals a clear exit strategy from the European routes. 
Armavia will transfer three of its five Airbus 320s to 
Siberian Airlines in Russia and replace them with old Soviet 
planes that are not allowed to land in European Airports. 
(Note:  Siberian Air owns a controlling share of Armavia 
Airlines.  End Note.)  The airline has also halted 
negotiations with Lufthansa on interline connections through 
Frankfurt and have withdrawn their bid for International Air 
Transport Association (IATA) certification. 
 
------------- 
\"TOO RUSSIAN\" 
------------- 
 
5. (SBU) \"The directors are too Russian,\" Chaplin told us 
when asked why Armavia had failed in its plan to become a 
western airline.  The expense of meeting European standards 
had proven to be far more than the directors anticipated or 
were willing to bear.  He higlighted as examples the fact 
that the directors refused to fly scheduled flights when 
they were not full, refused to contract an attorney to 
negotiate interline agreements, and refused to open their 
aircraft and their books to inspection by third parties. 
 
---------------------------- 
CHANGES A BREACH OF CONTRACT 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Armavia\'s withdrawal from its strategy puts it in 
breach of several investment conditions of its contract with 
the GOAM:  it is not yet clear how the government will 
react, however.  In case of a material breach the government 
has the right to cancel Armavia\'s licenses and resell them 
to another airline.  According to Viktor Mnatsakanian,  the 
legal advisor to Minister of Justice David Harutunyan, the 
Minister is aware of Armavia\'s move but the government has 
not yet taken any decision on how to respond. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) If the GOAM were to revoke Armavia\'s licenses it 
could exacerbate the situation considerably:  Armavia\'s USD 
14 million loss would likely send danger signs to potential 
investors.  The reversal of Armavia\'s strategy is a serious 
blow to Armenia\'s civil aviation industry, suggesting that 
Armenia cannot support an airline that meets modern Western 
standards and depriving a land-locked country of vital 
transportation links.

1.  Several recently implemented INL-funded programs 
are already reaping benefits.  This cable details 
highlights of program progress. 
 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS PROGRAMS 
 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++ 
OSCE Anti-TIP Legislative Strengthening Program 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++ 
 
2.  INL provided a Letter of Contribution for USD 
45,906 to OSCE for a program entitled \"Assistance to 
Anti-trafficking Legislative Review.\" The program will 
conduct a legislative gaps analysis, draft legislative 
amendments, assist in the development of an interagency 
task force, support the establishment of national 
referral mechanisms for identification, assistance and 
protection of victims, develop a task force training 
module and create a \"best practice\" manual for law 
enforcement to investigate and prosecute human 
trafficking.  Thus far, the program has accomplished 
the following: 
 
--An international expert has been identified and is 
working with a team of three national experts on the 
legislative gaps analysis.  The first draft version of 
the analysis will be ready during the second week of 
April. 
 
--OSCE is working closely with the Armenian 
Government\'s Working Group on the Criminal Procedure 
Code (Ministry of Justice, Procurator General\'s Office 
and the National Police), which is currently drafting 
amendments to the Code.  (NOTE: The Procurator 
General\'s Office (OPG) and the Ministry of Justice are 
the most important players--OPG is developing 
provisions on witness protection, and the Ministry of 
Justice will most likely be submitting the package of 
amendments to the National Assembly.  END NOTE.)  The 
first draft package of amendments to the Criminal 
Procedure Code will be finalized and submitted to the 
OSCE Office in Yerevan by April 6, 2004. 
Simultaneously, the package will be sent to relevant 
agencies for comment.  Upon their receipt by OSCE, the 
draft provisions will be translated (approximately 
within 10 days) and submitted to the Anti-TIP 
Legislative Strengthening Program\'s international 
expert for review.  The expert opinion is expected to 
be available after mid-May and will be submitted to the 
Government\'s Working Group on the Criminal Procedure 
Code. 
 
--OSCE is currently developing an expert-level meeting 
that will be convened in Yerevan in July 2004.  The 
meeting will provide a forum for the relevant state 
authorities, NGOs and bar associations to discuss the 
proposed Criminal Procedure Code amendments with the 
international expert. 
 
--In July 2004, Phase One of the project (which focuses 
on procedural safeguards of victim/witness protection) 
will be essentially completed (although follow-up with 
the National Assembly will continue beyond July 2004 
into fall 2004).  At the same time, Phase Two will 
commence with a focus on non-procedural 
safeguards/assessment of prerequisites for creation of 
a witness protection program - including 
recommendations for a separate Law on Witness 
Protection. 
 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++ 
IOM Anti-TIP Consular Capacity Building Program 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++ 
 
3.  INL provided a Letter of Contribution to IOM for 
USD 78,626 for a program entitled \"Capacity Building 
for Consular Personnel in Trafficking: Armenia.\" The 
program aims to ensure that the Armenian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Consular Department personnel obtain 
training necessary to effectively assist potential and 
actual trafficking victims in Armenia, as well as in 
respective destination countries where Armenian 
Diplomatic Missions are represented.  To date, this 
program has done the following: 
 
--Created a detailed action plan on the implementation 
of the Project developed in coordination with the MFA. 
 
--Two computers and one printer were provided on 1 
April 2004 to the MFA Consular Department; one computer 
went to the MFA\'s International Department; and one 
computer was placed in the Department for Migration and 
Refugees Counter-trafficking Focal Point, to be used 
exclusively for the implementation of counter- 
trafficking programs. 
 
--In anticipation of IT training, a tender was 
announced for the provision of IT training to select 
MFA personnel. 
 
--A questionnaire for baseline assessment of the 
current level of knowledge of counter-trafficking 
issues was developed for staff of Armenian Embassies 
and Consulates in key destination countries. 
 
--IOM has begun preparation of a two-day workshop for a 
selected MFA personnel and the DMR focal point on 
sensitization to trafficking-related issues; the 
distinction between trafficked migrants and migrants in 
an irregular situation; counter-trafficking database 
development and information exchange; and protection 
and assistance to victims. 
 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + 
IOM NGO Capacity and Victim Assistance Program 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + 
 
4.  IOM was provided a Letter of Contribution in the 
amount of $76,143 for a program entitled \"Capacity 
Building of a National NGO Providing Support and 
Counseling in Favor of Victims of Trafficking: 
Armenia.\" Just over USD 60,000 of this funding will be 
granted by IOM to the national NGO \"Hope and Help\" to 
fully fund their trafficking victim assistance project. 
The remainder of funds will be used by IOM to provide 
training and ongoing guidance to the NGO project staff. 
Victim assistance includes legal, psychological, 
medical and reintegration assistance as well as safe 
haven for victims.  To date: 
 
--An interactive training was conducted for all NGO 
staff to enhance their ability to properly assist 
trafficking victims. 
 
--2000 anti-trafficking information leaflets were 
distributed to Border Guard officials and targeted 
Armenian travelers. 
 
--A toll free hotline was set up and continues 
operation.  A countrywide advertising campaign for the 
hotline is underway.  To date approximately 35 callers 
have received legal consultation on the hotline. 
 
--A safe haven was established.  To date 8 victims of 
trafficking in persons (from Uzbekistan) in Armenia 
have received safe haven, medical, legal and 
psychological assistance.  Six of the eight received 
voluntary return assistance (with separate IOM Global 
Funds) to Uzbekistan. 
 
--Two Armenian returnee victims of trafficking have 
been provided with legal and medical assistance.  One 
of the two is receiving vocational training as part of 
the reintegration portion of the program. 
 
--\"Hope and Help\" is currently developing training for 
Border Guard personnel on victim identification. 
 
COMPUTER CLASSROOM PROJECT 
 
5. In accordance with Amendment No. One to the Letter 
of Agreement on Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement 
Assistance (LOA), INL/RM procured equipment to 
establish computer classrooms in three training 
facilities for law enforcement in Armenia.  Most of the 
equipment has been received (although several 
backordered items have not yet arrived), and 
installation by a local contractor is underway.  Twenty- 
five computers and two servers have already been 
installed in the National Police Academy.  Ten 
computers and two servers are currently being installed 
in the Prosecutorial Training Center.  Within the week, 
installation of fifteen computers and two servers 
should be completed at the Police NCO Training Facility 
in Kanaker.  The Embassy is planning opening ceremonies 
at the Police Academy within the next two weeks.  This 
program will contribute greatly to modernization of 
training methodologies and curricula development. It 
will also be a vital element in preparing law 
enforcement officers who are largely unfamiliar with 
computers for the upcoming INL-funded Regional Police 
Computer Network Project, as detailed in the proposed 
Amendment No. Two to the LOA. 
 
6.  In short, post\'s INL funded programs are well on 
their way to fruition.

SUBJECT: FORTHCOMING AGREEMENT ON ARMENIA-IRAN PIPELINE 
MEANS LITTLE 
 
REF: A) YEREVAN 382 B) YEREVAN 698 
 
Classified By: DCM Vivian Walker for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Post skepticism about the viability of the 
Iran-Armenia pipeline project notwithstanding, two points 
should be clear.  One, the pipeline is the number one 
priority for the Ministry of Energy.  Two, the Iranian 
Minister will come to Armenia in April and will sign 
something:  most probably an agreement on the future price of 
gas.  These two facts do not change the longstanding basis of 
our skepticism: there is no money to build the pipeline, and 
once built, it is unlikely to be a cost-efficient source of 
energy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
STILL NO MONEY TO CONSTRUCT... 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) While officials at the Ministry of Energy are trying 
to move the pipeline forward with agreements specifying the 
terms of a future deal, they have admitted to us that crucial 
parts of the plan are still missing (reftels).  Assuming that 
Iran is willing to complete its portion of the pipeline (for 
USD 100 million), Armenia still has not identified any money 
to finance the construction of the line in Armenian territory 
(another USD 100 million).  (Note: According to a local 
consultant and advisor to the Ministry of Energy, Armenia 
just rejected a proposal by Iran to have Armenia finance its 
portion of the pipeline to be paid back in gas.  End Note.) 
While government officials have hinted that they are looking 
for foreign assistance for the project, the Deputy Minister 
of Energy has told us that he does not have high expectations 
(See ref B).  Local delegates of both the EU and EBRD have 
denied statements in the press that those organizations were 
willing to finance the project. 
 
3. (C) Although GOAM officials have told us that Russian 
energy giant Gazprom is interested in financing the project, 
Russian Political and Economic Affairs Counselor Oleg 
Korobkov told us candidly that the Russian government will 
never authorize any Gazprom investments in Armenia that would 
limit Russia\'s current position as sole supplier of natural 
gas for Armenia. 
 
------------------------- 
...AND STILL BAD BUSINESS 
------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Even if Armenia had the cash to build the pipeline, 
the deal still does not pencil out as a cost-efficient source 
of energy.  (Note:  Armenia could, of course, extract USD 100 
million in rents from somewhere to finance the pipeline, 
which would be roughly 15 percent of the government\'s annual 
budget.  End Note.)  Because Armenia receives gas from Russia 
at rates substantially below market value, Armenia\'s private 
(and Russian) thermal power plants are unlikely to buy more 
expensive gas from Iran.  It is not clear that the Armenian 
government could afford to pay the difference between the 
Iranian contract price and the Russian price without 
significantly raising the price of electricity, which the 
Minister of Energy has consistently ruled out. 
 
------------------------------ 
COMMENT: TILTING AT WINDMILLS? 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) There is no better evidence that Armenian officials 
are tilting at windmills than their persistent talk of 
re-exporting gas through Georgia.  Currently the Ministry is 
talking about a pipeline with a capacity for 3 billion cubic 
meters per year, far more than Armenia can use.  But 
opportunities for onward sales of gas look specious:  Georgia 
and Turkey have other supply options and foreign investors 
(who are necessary for a project of this size) are unlikely 
to support an Iran-Armenia-and-beyond pipeline given the 
current situation.  In order to realize this project without 
foreign assistance, Armenia will have to divert substantial 
resources from other government priorities in order to spend 
them on an enterprise that is economically unjustifiable. 
Nonetheless, the Minister of Energy and his deputy have been 
clear that they would pursue the project anyway, if it were 
their decision to take.  Whether the sheer impracticality of 
the plan will ultimately trump the government\'s ambitions 
remains to be seen, but the recent spate of chatter about the 
pipeline does not bring the project any closer to reality 
than it was ten years ago.

SUBJECT: REAFFIRMING TIES WITH ARMENIA:  DEPUTY SECRETARY 
MEETS WITH OSKANIAN AND KOCHARIAN 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John Ordway for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage\'s visit 
to Armenia galvanized U.S.-Armenia relations as he met with 
Armenian Foreign Minister Oskanian and President Kocharian in 
back-to-back meetings March 26.  The meeting with Oskanian 
clearly set the agenda for the subsequent discussion with 
Kocharian, and the two meetings covered the range of the 
U.S.-Armenian agenda, touching briefly on Armenian domestic 
issues before moving to the range of Armenia\'s relationships 
with its neighbors Azerbaijan, Turkey, Georgia, Russia and 
Iran.  The Foreign Minister and President also discussed 
Armenia\'s readiness to engage NATO and work on improving 
U.S.-Armenian military cooperation with the Deputy Secretary, 
including a new proposal (see paragraph 9).  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
STRIKINGLY WARM WELCOME 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian himself greeted the 
Deputy Secretary and his party at the airport, a distinction 
usually reserved for heads of state.  (Note:  Oskanian had 
changed his travel plans to suit the Deputy Secretary\'s 
schedule; he was to have been in Minsk for new Russian 
Foreign Minister Lavrov\'s first CIS Ministerial.  End Note.) 
President Kocharian chose to conduct most of his meeting in 
English:  an indication of his desire to create a welcoming 
and cooperative atmosphere.  The core of the U.S. side in the 
meetings consisted of Deputy Secretary Armitage, EUR A/S 
Jones, NSC Bryza and Charge.  The Foreign Minister was joined 
by Deputy Foreign Minister Tatul Margarian, Head of the 
Americas Desk Lilit Toutkhalian and other staff.  The 
President was joined by Oskanian, Minister of Defense Serzh 
Sargsian as well as staff members. 
 
-------------------------------- 
ANTICIPATING OPPOSITION ACTIVITY 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) Oskanian previewed possible domestic difficulties, 
noting that \"We\'re going through a difficult period.  Our 
opposition got excited at the example of (the Rose Revolution 
in) Georgia.\"  He acknowledged that there will be some 
opposition demonstrations, and continued, \"There will be 
tough times on both sides.\"  Oskanian admitted that \"our 
(presidential) elections were flawed\" and he referred to 
international criticism as \"to the point;\" nonetheless, he 
noted that, \"unlike Georgia, no one really questioned the 
outcome.\"  In this context Oskanian raised the National 
Democratic Institute\'s (NDI) role in Armenia, saying that he 
thinks \"they\'re doing a wonderful job.\"  (Note:  NDI\'s 
activities in Armenia are focused on building political party 
capacity.  End Note.)  He complained, however, that every 
time the opposition meets with NDI, the opposition portrays 
their meeting both to their own members and to the Armenian 
public in general as \"proof\" that the U.S. backs their cause. 
 The Deputy Secretary made clear to Oskanian and later 
Kocharian that \"We\'re not in the business of picking winners 
and losers.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
TROUBLED ARMENIAN-AZERBAIJANI RELATIONS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Oskanian said that despite current heightened 
difficulties in Armenian-Azerbaijani relations there was no 
unusual tension along the line of conflict.  Noting that the 
planned Prague meeting of Foreign Ministers had just been 
postponed, Oskanian said that he and Kocharian were already 
looking forward to a possible Kocharian-Aliyev meeting in 
Warsaw at the upcoming EU economic conference.  Kocharian 
subsequently commented that he can \"discuss everything with 
(Aliyev) but that doesn\'t mean that we can work together.\" 
He added that he\'s not sure Aliyev is ready to \"take any step 
forward,\" owing to his domestic political situation or his 
own inexperience -- or both.  Kocharian also described what 
he sees as a fundamental \"ethnic incompatibility\" between the 
Armenians and the Azerbaijanis, referring repeatedly to what 
he called a \"cultural chasm\" between Christianity and Islam. 
Kocharian insisted, \"I don\'t believe that European-style 
democracy is suitable for Azerbaijan:  the more money from 
oil (they get), the less willing they will be to integrate 
into European structures.\"  Kocharian maintained that the 
elder Aliyev understood these basic differences very well. 
Kocharian even quoted Aliyev as saying that \"We have to 
separate from each other.  Maybe someday we could be good 
neighbors.\"  Referring to what he called Haydar Aliyev\'s 
sense of \"historic responsibility\" to solve the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Kocharian concluded that his 
impression of \"Ilham is that he doesn\'t have the internal 
motivation to solve it.\" 
 
-------------------------------- 
RUSSIA:  COMPLEMENTARITY THE KEY 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Good relations with Russia are crucial, but Oskanian 
noted that Armenia is willing to also expand its cooperation 
with NATO, and Kocharian pointed out that \"We don\'t want to 
gain from the contradiction with you and Russia.  We want to 
gain from the cooperation between you -- and we can.\" 
Kocharian noted that the Russians could play a positive role 
in Ajara and agreed that \"we have to keep things stable in 
Georgia.\"  Kocharian went on to say that he believes 
President Putin \"understands (the need for a stable situation 
in Georgia) very well and ... things have calmed down in 
Ajara because of Putin.\"  When the Deputy Secretary suggested 
that Putin had been pleasantly surprised about Saakashvili, 
Kocharian agreed, saying \"Putin told me the same thing.  It\'s 
important to reach agreement (in Ajara) and then enforce the 
agreement.\" 
----------------------------- 
GEORGIA:  ESSENTIAL LIFE-LINE 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Oskanian pointed out how crucial stability in Georgia 
is for Armenia.  (Note:  The vast majority of energy and 
other essential goods that Armenia imports transit through 
Georgia.  End Note.)  Kocharian added that the GOAM had kept 
in contact with Georgia throughout the crisis in Ajara, 
although they hadn\'t \"advertised\" it, and cited military, 
presidential and diplomatic contacts at all levels.  He also 
noted that Minister of Defense Sargsian will be in Tbilisi 
April 1 to consult with his colleagues there.  Both Oskanian 
and Kocharian noted that Armenia and Georgia share 
fundamental values such as Christianity which further 
strengthened their relationship. 
 
------------------------- 
TURKEY:  AZERBAIJANI TOOL 
------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Citing GOAM disappointment with the lack of progress 
in the relationship with Turkey, Oskanian noted that 
Kocharian would not be attending the upcoming Istanbul Summit 
in Turkey.  The most recent two of his three meetings with 
Turkish FM Gul had not gone well, Oskanian said.  It appeared 
to him that Turkey had hardened its position that its border 
with Armenia would remain closed until the N-K conflict had 
been resolved.  Kocharian went further, lambasting the 
Turkish government for letting itself be used as a \"tool\" for 
Azerbaijan.  He added that Turkey was incapable of 
\"pragmatism\" when it came to Armenia and that Turkey was \"too 
emotional\" to work together with Armenia to improve 
relations.  Kocharian concluded that \"We are ready to discuss 
relations, to negotiate everything without preconditions: 
this is not easy for an Armenian president!\" 
 
-------------------------------------- 
IRAN:  GAS PIPELINE ON EVERYONE\'S MIND 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Oskanian assured the Deputy Secretary that an 
effective export control regime is firmly in place vis-a-vis 
Iran, and emphasized that the \"gas pipeline is becoming a 
reality.\"  Oskanian further outlined a scenario in which the 
paperwork for the Iran-Armenian Pipeline would be completed 
early this year, construction would begin in 2004, and gas 
would flow in 2006.  Kocharian agreed with Oskanian that the 
pipeline is just around the corner, noting that the \"most 
efficient cooperation (Armenia has) with Iran is in the field 
of energy,\" specifically on the pipeline.  Kocharian noted, 
however, that Armenia still needed to look for funding for 
its portion of the pipeline.  Options include asking the EU 
for the money, funding the project out of the state budget, 
or negotiating  with Russian energy giant Gazprom for 
possible financing.  (Note:  Embassy doubts that any of these 
options is viable at this time.  End Note.)  Kocharian also 
mentioned that Iran is ready to loan Armenia the necessary 
funding, but wryly acknowledged that Armenia had never 
\"received a cent from Iran\" in the past. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
MILITARY COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. AND NATO TO INCREASE 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
9. (C) Noting that Armenia\'s special relationship with Russia 
does not preclude increased cooperation with NATO (see 
above), Oskanian highlighted Armenia\'s readiness to move to 
an IPAP with NATO, its intention to upgrade its 
representation to NATO, and its willingness to undertake a 
defense assessment.  Oskanian repeated GOAM concern about the 
lack of FMF parity with Azerbaijan in the proposed USG 
assistance budget and asked, \"What can we do for projects to 
get the FMF amounts to parity?\"  Oskanian then suggested 
establishing a program to train and equip a company-sized 
peacekeeping force (to be deployed under UN Chapter 6). The 
Deputy Secretary promised to bring this new proposal to 
Washington for consideration.  Kocharian also underscored his 
desire for increased military cooperation, saying that the 
only limitations would be that the U.S. could not use those 
bases where Russians were currently stationed.  Kocharian 
emphasized that, \"Our relationship with Russia is very good 
but it\'s not a relationship where they can dictate things to 
us.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
10. (C) Both Kocharian and Oskanian clearly appreciated the 
Deputy Secretary\'s commitment to pay more attention to our 
relationships in the region and to Armenia in particular. 
The warmth and candor which characterized the meetings 
suggest that Armenia is eager to deepen its relationship with 
the USG.  The GOAM will be watching closely to see if U.S. 
attention flags, and will remain strongly aware that, as 
Kocharian noted, \"the U.S. is far away, but it is everywhere.\"

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Prominent human rights activist Mikhail 
Danielyan discharged himself from the hospital April 4, 
and remains at home recovering from the March 30 
beating by unknown assailants.  Danielyan offered no 
new information regarding the attack, but told us he 
strongly feels that it was \"government-ordered.\"  He 
hypothesizes that he was a \"test-case\" for the 
authorities to determine international response to 
their heavy-handed tactics against the opposition. 
President Kocharian has charged Procurator-General 
Aghvan Hovsepian with personally overseeing the 
investigation into the attack.  End Summary. 
 
------------------ 
IMPROVED CONDITION 
------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) We visited human rights activist Mikhail 
Danielyan at his home April 7.  Danielyan told us that 
he had discharged himself from the hospital April 4, 
choosing to convalesce at home rather than \"suffer 
further\" in the hospital.  He was lucid, and the 
injuries sustained to his face had largely healed. 
Danielyan said that doctors told him he did not have a 
concussion as initially thought, but he told us he 
still had \"terrible headaches\" and had trouble sleeping 
and concentrating. 
 
--------------------------------- 
CRITICISM OF INVESTIGATION\'S PACE 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The day after the attack, President Kocharian 
publicly announced that Procurator-General (PG) Aghvan 
Hovsepian would personally head the investigation of 
the Danielyan beating.  An official in the PG\'s office 
told us April 8 that a full investigation had been 
launched, with local police interviewing witnesses. 
Danielyan told us that he had spoken with authorities 
only once since his initial statement to the police. 
Danielyan claims that his recent meeting with an 
official from the PG\'s office was merely a formality. 
He complained that he had not been examined by a 
medical official from the PG\'s office, as required by 
Armenian law  (Note:  The official in the PG\'s office 
told us that Danielyan had received written 
notification from the Forensic Department of the PG\'s 
office requesting the examination, but Danielyan had 
not responded.  End Note.) 
 
---------------------------- 
\"TEST-CASE\" FOR AUTHORITIES? 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Danielyan maintained that he could not 
identify his assailants, but they were of the \"gray, 
thuggish\" variety.  Despite any direct evidence, 
Danielyan is sure that the authorities organized the 
attack.  He believes that the authorities were seeking 
to incapacitate him during the planned opposition 
campaign to unseat the government.  Danielyan alleges 
that his beating was a \"test-case\" to see if Western 
embassies would protest the government\'s heavy-handed 
tactics.  According to Danielyan, failure to do so 
emboldened the police and other security forces to take 
similar action against opposition supporters. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
COMMENT: LACK OF EVIDENCE LEAVES ROOM FOR SPECULATION 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6. (SBU) Danielyan is now convinced that his beating 
was in fact not directly related to the Echo newspaper 
article in which he made comments that could be 
considered pro-Azerbaijani (see reftel).  Certainly not 
one to ever shy away from broader conspiracy theories, 
Danielyan now maintains that the article provided a 
pretext for the assault that leaves him bedridden for 
the start of the opposition\'s campaign to unseat 
President Kocharian.  We tend to doubt this 
explanation; however, there is little evidence for any 
theory.  What is certain, however, is that Danielyan 
will be forced to take a much less active role in 
personally monitoring the demonstrations than he did 
last year, when he assisted numerous people detained 
during the opposition protests of the election results. 
He will need to rely on his staff at the Helsinki 
Association to follow through in his absence.

Classified By: Ambassador John Ordway for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) We continue to believe that the current round of 
opposition protests across Armenia is unlikely to develop 
into a revolution, rose, velvet or otherwise (reftel).  The 
Ambassador has urged restraint in the strongest possible 
terms during meetings this week with both senior government 
officials and key opposition leaders, and we remain convinced 
that the leadership on both sides wants to avoid violence. 
As both the opposition and government raise the rhetorical 
stakes, however, and skirmishes around the opposition rallies 
make headlines, we want to explore potential alternative 
Armenian scenarios:  what happens if we\'re wrong?  End 
Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
AMBASSADOR URGES RESTRAINT 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (C) The Ambassador has strongly urged restraint during 
meetings this week with the most prominent opposition 
leaders, Stepan Demirchian and Artashes Geghamian, as well as 
with Foreign Minister Oskanian.  The Ambassador warned 
Oskanian that the government had a special responsibility to 
avoid violent outbreaks at the upcoming demonstrations, and 
noted our concern that the police stood by and did not 
intervene during the incident March 5 when members of private 
security forces (as identified by Oskanian) destroyed 
journalists\' cameras and equipment.  The Ambassador noted 
that if there were significant violence at upcoming rallies 
the government would be held accountable in international 
public opinion, and that any serious disturbances would harm 
Armenia\'s economy. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
VIOLENCE COULD UP THE ANTE CONSIDERABLY... 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) The authorities have been concentrating their 
efforts on reducing the number of possible demonstrators. 
They are reportedly using the police in provincial towns and 
villages to pressure people to stay out of Yerevan on April 
9, and will undoubtedly undertake measures to impede traffic 
into the city that day.  These actions, along with arrests of 
opposition activists, opening a criminal investigation of the 
opposition Justice Alliance, and calling in selected 
opposition MPs for questioning by the procuracy, are 
increasing an already tense situation.  Some prominent 
opposition leaders (but not Geghamian or Demirchian) are much 
more inclined to confrontation, even violent confrontation. 
Both senior government and opposition leaders continue to 
emphasize their commitment to keeping the situation peaceful. 
 During similar election-related demonstrations in 2003, both 
sides acted with considerable restraint.  That outcome seems 
somewhat less likely this time as the mood has turned harsher 
across the board.  If security officials on the street become 
involved in further violent altercations and if anyone were 
seriously injured or killed we expect that public emotions 
could well lead to large-scale demonstrations (with 50,000 or 
more people on the streets) which would open the door to even 
more opportunities for violence. 
 
4. (C)  There is at least one intriguing sign that even 
senior government officials are concerned about the outcome. 
One source in a sensitive position claimed that President 
Kocharian and Defense Minister Sargsian have hedged their 
bets and sent their families to Moscow, while Prime Minister 
Margarian has sent his family to France.  (However, at a 
dinner on April 4 the Ambassador spent several hours with 
Mrs. Bella Kocharian.  In the course of an extended 
conversation, she showed no concern about the current 
political situation, although she did mention that she had 
just returned from several days in Moscow.) 
 
----------------- 
...BUT THEN WHAT? 
----------------- 
 
5. (C) Even if we assume that sufficiently large, widespread, 
prolonged demonstrations would lead Kocharian to resign we 
are still faced with the question of what would happen then. 
Constitutionally the next person in line is the Speaker of 
the National Assembly Artur Baghdasarian.  While he is not a 
Kocharian \"crony\" he is certainly not part of the opposition, 
and would not be likely to make things easy for the 
opposition.  There is no clear opposition figure who could 
replace Kocharian, and there is little that various factions 
in the opposition agree on except for their desire to remove 
Kocharian. 
 
------------------------------ 
BAGHDASARIAN A POSSIBLE WINNER 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Baghdasarian has been developing a stronger public 
profile over the past ten months, and his recent statements 
urging government restraint and calling on the government to 
stop using detentions to intimidate opposition politicians 
are notable in their moderation.  It is not inconceivable 
that, were Kocharian to resign, a disgruntled Armenian 
electorate would turn to him rather than to any of the 
opposition politicians.  As part of the current governing 
coalition, he might also be acceptable to current members of 
the Kocharian government. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
\"PEACEMAKER\" ROLE COULD WIN BIG FOR DASHNAKS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF - 
\"Dashnaksutyun\") Party attempted to fill the widening 
political divide in late March by offering a \"consultative 
role\" for the opposition.  Prominent ARF Party leader and 
National Assembly Deputy Speaker Vahan Hovanessian even went 
so far as to urge the governing coalition to find better ways 
to consider opposition policy concerns.  The role of 
potential peacemaker is relatively new for the ARF, whose 
polarizing rhetoric (on topics such as Turkey and N-K) is 
periodically the source of contention among the governing 
coalition or a target for opposition criticism.  Even though 
the opposition categorically rejected the offer, the ARF\'s 
political olive branch was the only such offer and gives the 
party a serious, policy-focused appearance in the midst of 
emotional political rhetoric.  If Kocharian were to resign, 
the ARF would likely maintain its seat at the table given the 
constructive face it has put forward thus far this Spring. 
 
------------- 
FINAL COMMENT 
------------- 
 
8. (C) As we noted initially, we still believe that the 
current round of protests will lose steam after several 
demonstrations.  The potential for violence exists, however, 
and if peaceful protesters were to be killed or seriously 
injured we would expect to see a significant backlash that 
could well provide momentum for much larger rallies with 
greater risks of violence.  The opposition simply does not 
have the resources to force Kocharian out of office if he 
doesn\'t choose to resign -- and we see no sign that he is 
about to leave office voluntarily.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Roughly ten thousand opposition 
demonstrators rallied peacefully April 9 in Yerevan 
on Opera Square.  In a meeting plagued by technical 
difficulties they called for Kocharian\'s 
resignation, and announced they will be \"occupying\" 
Opera Square until Kocharian leaves office.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
RETIREES, THE UNEMPLOYED, STUDENTS -- AND MALE 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (SBU) About 90 percent of the roughly ten 
thousand opposition supporters who gathered in Opera 
Square on a warm and sunny Friday afternoon were 
male, mostly beyond retirement age (with a few 
students as well, including one twenty-something 
youth sporting a red Che Guevara sweatshirt with the 
slogan \"Hasta La Vista, Baby\").  The crowd started 
gathering about 3:30 for a scheduled 4:00 rally, and 
stayed largely quiet while the organizers labored to 
get their sound system working -- the speeches 
started about 5:00.  As the crowd lackadaisically 
cheered an occasional comment from the podium, spit 
sunflower seeds and bought ice cream from 
enterprising vendors, a large security presence 
(both uniformed police and plainclothes) kept a 
close eye on proceedings and the crowd. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
NOT ENOUGH UNITY TO NAME A SINGLE SPOKESMAN... 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4. (SBU) While highlighting their recent decision to 
work together toward Kocharian\'s ouster and posing 
with arms linked and upraised, opposition leaders 
each took an extended turn at the microphone.  With 
the Communists calling for a return to the Soviet 
era, when \"everything was better,\" and other 
opposition leaders attacking everything from 
Minister of Defense Serzh Sargsian\'s gambling to the 
Yerevan Brandy Company privatization, the only thing 
they all agreed on was calling for Kocharian\'s 
resignation.  Republic Party leader Aram Sargsian 
announced (to a somewhat skeptical crowd) that 
\"negotiations are underway\" and that President 
Kocharian might be resigning \"even before this 
meeting is over.\" 
 
-------------------- 
CALLING FOR A SIT-IN 
-------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) People\'s Party of Armenia Chairman Stepan 
Demirchian announced that the opposition had decided 
not to march to the Presidential Palace because of 
the heavy security presence there and because the 
opposition didn\'t want to do anything that might 
give the government \"the excuse to create a 
provocation.\"  Instead of a march, rally organizers 
called for all \"strong men\" to stay in Opera Square 
until Kocharian resigns.  After asking if there was 
\"anyone in the crowd who can sing or tell stories\" 
to come up to the microphone to entertain those 
staging the sit-in the majority of the opposition 
supporters were leaving the square.  While we expect 
that perhaps as many as several hundred supporters 
may stay Friday night, we expect people will go home 
for Easter at the latest.  Rally organizers 
announced an April 10 follow-on meeting at 6:00 to 
\"discuss further steps.\" 
 
---------------------- 
RESTRAINT ON ALL SIDES 
---------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Security forces around the rally were 
attentive, but even when following reporters through 
the crowd they stayed at least 10-15 feet away, and 
seemed to be under orders to avoid trouble.  When, 
for example, an older gentleman was absently 
spinning an open pocketknife they moved closer, but 
as soon as they realized he posed no threat they 
moved away again without confronting him. 
 
-------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  NO \"BUZZ\" IN THE CROWD 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Ten thousand people at a rally is more than 
we\'ve seen since the demonstrations following last 
year\'s elections, but there was no real excitement 
in the crowd.  The end of the rally was clearly anti- 
climactic, and organizers never built up the level 
of emotional support that they had in 2003.  We will 
continue to watch the situation carefully, but for 
now see little prospect for radical change (ref A).

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Between five and ten thousand opposition 
demonstrators rallied peacefully April 12 in Yerevan 
on Opera Square before moving roughly half a mile 
down a major street toward the Presidential Palace. 
Authorities made no attempts to slow or stop the 
protesters until they reached a line of concertina 
wire protecting the final approach to the Palace. 
Demonstrators and authorities showed restraint with 
no incidents by 9:30 p.m. local time.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
MARCH PAST THE EMBASSY 
---------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Several thousand demonstrators moved along 
Baghramian Street and past our Embassy without 
incident on their way to the Presidential Palace 
before they stopped at the concertina wire barricade 
roughly two blocks from the Palace.  The restrained 
crowd chanted an occasional \"Kocharian Out,\" 
listened to speeches and traditional Armenian folk 
music and slowly trickled away, although a 
significant number of opposition supporters were 
still milling on the street as darkness fell at 9:30 
local time. 
 
------------------------- 
BOTH SIDES SHOW RESTRAINT 
------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) With ambulances, special service troops and 
water canon standing by, authorities let the 
opposition demonstrate without attempting to 
intervene.  The marchers proceeded in an orderly 
fashion, with no pushing against the barrier or even 
jostling each other.  Both the government and the 
opposition clearly wanted to avoid violence. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
COMMENT:  THEY CAME, THEY PROTESTED, THEY WENT HOME 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (SBU) Although we expect that protests will 
continue in the short term (beautiful spring weather 
is certainly contributing to the opposition\'s 
ability to draw crowds) we do not anticipate any 
more serious consequences.  The \"revolutionary 
spark\" was simply not present at the April 12 
demonstration and march; in fact, the atmosphere was 
nearer that of a home football game (or a family 
picnic that just wouldn\'t end) than that of an 
enraged body politic.

INTRANSIGENT FOR NOW 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John Ordway for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------------------------ 
KOCHARIAN SEEKING ADVICE 
------------------------ 
 
1. (C) Following the forceful break-up of the opposition 
demonstration at roughly 2:00 a.m. April 13 (septel) and the 
subsequent detentions, Kocharian convoked the Ambassador, 
saying, \"I invited you in order to consult with you on the 
internal political situation.\"  Although Kocharian did not 
appear to be entirely ready yet to move forward, and 
mentioned his intention to have the Prosecutor-General follow 
up with criminal cases against opposition figures, he did 
actively seek the opportunity to take our advice on board. 
The Ambassador urged him in the strongest possible terms to 
cease the detentions of political opponents and to forego 
criminal cases against them.  Ambassador Ordway emphasized 
that the government can avoid making the situation worse by 
choosing not to pursue political leaders with criminal 
charges (even if they have allegedly committed technically 
illegal acts). 
 
--------------------------------------- 
OPPOSITION IN A FURY, UNWILLING TO TALK 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Notwithstanding the fact that the opposition 
demonstrators and leaders painted themselves into a corner 
with Monday night\'s demonstration blocking one of Yerevan\'s 
major streets by not simply declaring \"victory\" and going 
home at dark, or at any other point earlier in the eight 
hours that the government tolerated the rally, they are livid 
at what has been happening since the rally was forcibly 
broken up early Tuesday morning.  We have spoken with 
opposition leaders from across the spectrum, and it is clear 
that they are unwilling to enter into any sort of dialogue 
for the moment.  The Ambassador spoke by telephone during the 
course of the day with Stepan Demirchian and Artashes 
Geghamian, the two principal opposition leaders, as well as 
several other major opposition figures.  He also spoke with 
the Speaker of Parliament and the Minister of Justice.  The 
opposition leaders were in an absolute fury over what had 
transpired.  While none of the leaders had any clear idea of 
where to go at this juncture, they rejected categorically the 
Ambassador\'s suggestion of dialogue and engagement with the 
authorities.  Both the Speaker and the Justice Minister, by 
contrast, strongly endorsed the need for a political dialogue 
and moving the current confrontation from the streets into a 
constructive venue, such as the Parliament. 
 
3. (C) The opposition faces insurmountable odds in their 
campaign to oust President Kocharian.  Although they appear 
sincere in their belief that the majority of the country 
supports them and their current course of aggressively 
seeking Kocharian\'s departure, neither we nor any other 
objective outside observer shares that view.  Moreover, the 
opposition\'s inability to agree on any positive policy 
platform undercuts their ability to appeal to, let alone 
consolidate, general popular dissatisfaction with Kocharian. 
They now find themselves in a blind alley, with few 
attractive options. 
 
----------------------- 
BURDEN ON THE PRESIDENT 
----------------------- 
 
4. (C) This circumstance puts the burden on President 
Kocharian to create sufficient political space to allow the 
opposition the option of turning from the streets to a 
political process.  It appears that at least some, and 
probably all, of the coalition members are willing and eager 
to engage in such a dialogue.  This will require the 
President to back off, and the opposition to overcome their 
current outraged hostility and return to the political arena.

SUMMARY

2. (SBU) At approximately 2:00 a.m. April 13, Armenian 
riot police dispersed a crowd of about one thousand 
opposition supporters that had remained in front of the 
National Assembly since 6:00 p.m. the previous day. 
The police used flash grenades, water cannons and 
batons to push the crowd away from the parliament 
building.  The police have detained an unknown number 
of opposition supporters.  Armenia\'s Human Rights 
Ombudsman confirms that several prominent opposition 
parliamentarians were detained.  An unknown number of 
opposition supporters have been hospitalized for 
injuries sustained during the confrontation with police 
forces.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
RIOT POLICE BREAK UP DEMONSTRATION 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) At approximately 2:00 a.m. April 13, Armenian 
riot police dispersed a crowd of about one thousand 
opposition supporters that had remained in front of the 
National Assembly since 6:00 p.m. the previous day. 
Embassy security camera video shows that at 1:50 a.m., 
police fired stun grenades in the direction of the 
demonstrators.  Approximately four minutes later, 
police directed water cannons at the crowd, special 
riot police units then moved into the crowd.  The riot 
police struck an unknown number of demonstrators with 
batons, and chased them down the street, away from the 
National Assembly building.  The newspaper Haykakan 
Zhamanak and the Russian Television station ORT report 
that the police beat journalists from their 
organizations.  One Embassy employee told us she 
witnessed several riot policemen chasing a demonstrator 
and then beating him with their batons for 30 seconds. 
President Kocharian told the Ambassador that the crowd 
engaged in violence, and that twenty policemen were 
injured during the course of the operation, with three 
hospitalized.  (Our review of the video suggests that 
there may have been some objects thrown by 
demonstrators, but only after the first stun grenade 
was fired.) 
 
------------------------ 
DOCTOR CONFIRMS INJURIES 
------------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) A doctor working at a local hospital told us 
that she had personally treated five individuals who 
were injured during the police action.  Three of them, 
including the ORT journalist, had been treated for cuts 
and bruises and released.  Two others remained 
hospitalized, both with injuries to their legs 
sustained when stun grenades exploded in their close 
proximity. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
OPPOSITION PARTY HEADQUARTERS RAIDED, CLOSED 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Police raided the offices of the opposition 
parties who had organized the anti-government rallies, 
detaining an unknown number of party workers.  Armenian 
People\'s Party (APP) Spokeswoman Ruzanna Khachatryan 
phoned us as police were entering the party 
headquarters at approximately 2:30 a.m.  Khachatryan 
reported that police were breaking into the building. 
The APP and Khachatryan\'s parents informed us later in 
the day that she is currently in detention at a local 
police station.  At midday April 13, we visited the 
headquarters of the National Accord Party, the Republic 
Party, and the APP.  A police vehicle was parked 
outside of the National Accord offices, and a large 
police contingent had completely sealed the Republic 
Party offices.  No police were present at APP 
headquarters, but a crowd of approximately 40 
supporters of APP leader Stepan Demirchian waited 
outside.  Many were in tears, and told us that waited 
for Demirchian to arrive to \"provide instruction.\" 
From what we could see of the party offices, they 
appeared to be completely ransacked:  no party workers 
were present.  (Note:  We could observe the ground- 
level offices of the APP from the street.  End Note.) 
The Ambassador subsequently spoke with Demirchian, who 
said he was in his office, but that it had been 
ransacked by the police. 
 
------------------------- 
PARLIAMENTARIANS DETAINED 
------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Armenia\'s Human Rights Ombudsman, Larissa 
Alaverdian, told us that she could confirm that several 
leading opposition deputies had been detained. 
According to Alaverdian, National Assembly members 
Tatul Manasarian, Arshak Sadoyan, Shavarsh Kocharian, 
and Albert Bazayan were taken into police custody. 
(Note:  We spoke with Manasarian later in the day; his 
detention was brief.  End Note.)  As members of the 
National Assembly they are entitled to complete 
immunity from prosecution: it is unclear under which 
authority the police hold them in detention.  OSCE 
Ambassador Vladimir Pryakhin told us that he has been 
informed that all four parliamentarians will be 
released by the end of the day.  A National Democratic 
Institute representative told us that opposition 
parties have reported the detention of at least four 
other National Assembly members:  Alexan Karapetyan of 
the National Accord, Vardan Mkrtchyan of APP, as well 
as Artak Zeynalyan and Vagharshak Harutunyan of the 
Republic Party.  National Assembly Speaker Baghdasarian 
told the Ambassador that he had assurances from the 
police that no deputies had been \"arrested,\" rather, 
they had been \"detained for questioning.\"  He said he 
expected them to be released shortly. 
 
--------------------------------- 
COMMENT: PROVOCATION AND OVERKILL 
--------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) It is not clear that the opposition calculated 
the impact of their decision to maintain a large crowd 
in the street indefinitely.  They left themselves no 
maneuvering room, and were either unwilling or unable 
to declare the demonstration a success and disband at a 
certain time--a decision that would have completely 
changed the current negative dynamic.  The authorities, 
for their part, allowed the demonstration to continue 
for about eight hours, despite the fact that the 
protestors had closed a major city street.  Earlier, 
they had not interfered with a much longer 
demonstration by several hundred activists over the 
weekend in the plaza adjacent to the Opera House. 
However, while the police actions to disperse the 
protestors involved only non-lethal force, its use 
turned excessive as demonstrators were fleeing. 
Subsequent efforts to detain opposition supporters and 
ransack opposition party offices are even more 
troubling.  The combination of opposition provocation, 
and government overkill, render the prospects of a 
quick political resolution to the crisis remote indeed.

Classified By: Ambassador John Ordway for reasons 1.5 (B, D) 
 
1.  (C)  Defense Minister Serzh Sargsian joined the 
Ambassador in opening a EUCOM-funded hospital renovation on 
April 14.  During the course of the event, the Ambassador had 
a 30-minute one-on-one conversation with him.  On the issue 
of the dispersal of the anti-Kocharian demonstration on April 
12, Sargsian was uncompromising.  He defended the need to 
clear the streets, and blamed the opposition for creating a 
situation in which the authorities had no other course they 
could take.  He pointed out that they had not interfered in 
the April 9 rally, nor had they acted in any way against the 
\"sit-in\" conducted in the square adjacent to the Opera House. 
 They also had not acted to prevent the march up Baghramian 
to the blocking point in front of the U.S. Embassy -- and had 
let the rally continue for over eight hours.  It was not, he 
argued, that the government was trying to stifle the 
opposition in expressing its views.  Rather, in his analysis, 
the opposition had deliberately and purposefully chosen to 
conduct the Baghramian demonstration because the authorities 
had not reacted to the previous demonstrations.  For their 
own purposes, he said, they needed a reaction from the 
government that would, in their concept, stimulate further 
mass support from the populace.  Sargsian charged that in 
this analysis, the opposition had been gravely mistaken: 
there was not overwhelming support for them in the 
population. 
 
2.  (C)  The Ambassador told Sargsian that it was now 
imperative to begin a dialogue with the opposition, and take 
steps to involve them in productive political activity. 
Sargsian immediately responded that the opposition was not 
interested in a dialogue.  The Ambassador said that this was 
correct, but only for now.  It was important for the 
authorities to now reduce the pressure, release detainees, 
and stop raiding political party headquarters.  If this were 
done, it would create conditions that would be conducive to 
the dialogue.  Sargsian immediately responded, \"of course, we 
will do all that.\"  He then veered off onto charges that at 
least elements of the opposition were violent, had committed 
criminal acts, and that calls for violent overthrow of the 
President were themselves criminal acts.  The Ambassador 
again urged that the police and prosecutors not pursue the 
vast majority of opposition figures who were using 
non-violent, political means.  Although he expressed 
continuing skepticism about whether the opposition would ever 
be prepared to enter into a dialogue, he reiterated that they 
intended to follow the very course the Ambassador had 
outlined. 
 
3. (C)  Comment:  Compared to the discussion with President 
Kocharian on April 13, Sargsian was if anything more intense 
on the culpability of the opposition, and on the need for 
tough measures to counter them.  However, unlike the 
President, he gave no sign that there was any consideration 
to continuing legal actions against the opposition.  While 
Kocharian was talking in terms of lessening the pressure if 
and only if the opposition engaged with the governing 
coalition, Sargsian presented that course as a matter of fact.

1. (S) Ambassador presented points per reftel to Minister of 
Defense Serge Sargsyan April 12.  Sargsyan first responded by 
agreeing that \"it was strange\" that Armenia had not declared 
the MT-LBs, and it was an incident that would not be 
repeated.  (Note:  The Armenian side freely acknowledge that 
there are MT-LBs in their inventory, and the Minister seemed 
taken aback by the fact they had not been declared.  End 
Note.)  Sargsyan briefly became combative when he deduced 
that the source of the information about pre-inspection 
inventory was not the CFE inspection team, and denied that 
any equipment had been moved.  He volunteered that the 
weapons system in question was not MT-LBs but Chinese-made 
weapons in the Armenian arsenal; and that any pre-inspection 
movements had legitimate reasons--a point the Ambassador 
rebutted.  Sargsyan finally conceded that perhaps some 
weapons had been moved by a \"strange or sick person,\" and 
that he would look in to the matter to ensure that it did not 
happen again.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenian opposition leaders Stepan Demirchian 
and Artashes Geghamian brushed off calls for dialogue 
with the government, instead calling for a new rally 
against President Kocharian in central Yerevan April 
16.  The police unsealed the offices of the National 
Accord Party April 14, and reopened the Republic Party 
offices April 15.  The police report that 115 people 
were either detained or taken in for questioning since 
April 13.  The police released all four national 
assembly members who had been held as witnesses, and 
many others who had been taken into custody April 12- 
13.  President Kocharian issued an appeal to the 
opposition to resume \"normal activities,\" but promised 
further police action against \"political extremism.\" 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
OPPOSITION DEFIES GOVERNMENT; PLANS NEW RALLY 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Despite the authorities\' crackdown on their 
activities during the previous 48 hours, opposition 
leaders Stepan Demirchian and Artashes Geghamian 
pledged April 14 to continue their anti-government 
campaign.  Defying a government ban on further 
unsanctioned rallies and rejecting calls to engage in a 
dialogue with the government, Demirchian and Geghamian 
announced that another demonstration against the 
government would be held April 16 in Yerevan\'s Opera 
Square.  Demirchian confirmed his plans in a press 
conference April 15.  (Comment:  One senior government 
official told us they didn\'t care what the opposition 
did at Opera Square, so long as they stayed there.  End 
Comment.) 
 
-------------------------- 
POLICE LEAVE PARTY OFFICES 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The police unsealed the offices of Artashes 
Geghamian\'s National Accord Party the afternoon of 
April 14.  The offices had been raided by the police 
immediately following the dispersal of the opposition 
demonstration in front of the National Assembly during 
the morning of April 13.  Geghamian claimed that police 
had confiscated most party documents, and thoroughly 
ransacked the headquarters.  Police also vacated the 
offices of the Republic Party at approximately 1:00 
p.m. April 15.  Republic Party leader Aram Sargsyan has 
not made a public appearance since the authorities 
broke up the opposition rally April 13, and his 
supporters claim he is in hiding.  The Procurator- 
General had singled out the Republic Party\'s leadership 
as most likely to face criminal prosecution for their 
calls for the violent overthrow of the state. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
PARLIAMENTARIANS RELEASED, DETENTION FIGURES UNCLEAR 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5. (SBU) The police released the four opposition 
deputies detained for questioning April 12-13.  Ruzanna 
Khachatryan, spokeswoman for Demirchian\'s Armenian 
People\'s Party, also left police custody April 14.  She 
told us that the police treated her well during her 48 
hours of detention (septel).  The Yerevan City Police 
reported that 115 people were detained during the same 
period, of whom 71 were no longer in police custody. 
Although opposition parties told us that they think the 
number of detentions was significantly higher, Human 
Rights Ombudsman Larissa Alaverdian, who has visited 
detention facilities, told us that she believes the 
police numbers are generally accurate. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
GOAM OFFICIALS DEFEND POLICE ACTIONS DURING RALLY 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
6. (SBU) Senior GOAM maintain that the force employed 
during the rally was at a commensurate and acceptable 
level.  In a televised interview, Procurator-General 
Aghvan Hovsepyan said that \"If the police, having acted 
in full accord with the letter and spirit of the law, 
had not prevented the further development of illegal 
actions of demonstrators on the night of 12-13 April, 
we would have to apply more severe official enforcement 
measures against the violators.\"  President Kocharian 
also defended the actions of the police against 
\"political extremists,\" and called on the opposition to 
participate in a political dialogue.  He stated that 
police would not have interfered with the demonstrators 
if they had remained in Opera Square, but the 
opposition had chosen to provoke the authorities by 
rallying in front of the parliament.   Foreign Minister 
Vartan Oskanian told the Ambassador April 14 that he 
and several other prominent ministers were in agreement 
that the opposition must be engaged to prevent a 
further worsening of the situation.  The Dashnakutyun 
Party, a member of the governing coalition, issued a 
statement calling for incorporating the opposition in 
governing bodies in order to defuse current tensions. 
(Note:  The Dashnakutyun have suggested a place on the 
National Security Council for the opposition.  End 
Note.) 
 
------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  SITUATION STILL TENSE 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The situation between the GOAM and the 
opposition remains tense.  Government authorities seem 
willing to open discussions with the opposition, but 
the opposition seems unlikely to heed Kocharian\'s plea 
for them to resume \"normal activities.\"  For their 
part, leading opposition figures are in no mood for any 
dialogue with the government--at least for now.  They 
likely hope that their April 16 rally will demonstrate 
growing support for their position.  Our best guess is 
that while most citizens disapprove of the government\'s 
tactics, this does not translate into active support 
for the opposition.  A weather forecast that calls for 
rain makes a large turnout even less likely.  We cannot 
rule out completely, however, either provocation by the 
opposition, or overkill by the government.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) We met with Ruzanna Khachatryan, Spokeswoman 
for the opposition Armenian People\'s Party (APP) to 
discuss the April 13 police raid on APP Headquarters 
and her 36-hour police detention.  Khachatryan 
described the police raid in detail, and depicted the 
behavior of the police during her detention more as 
\"annoying\" than abusive.  She believes that the police 
and procurator\'s office were trying to intimidate her 
and send a message rather than pursue a criminal 
investigation.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
POLICE STORM APP OFFICE 
----------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Ruzanna Khachatryan, Spokeswoman and rally 
organizer for the APP, was in the party offices 
preparing a promotional videotape for the party in the 
early morning of April 13.  She told us she received a 
call from a staff member at the National Accord Party 
who told her that police had just broken up the 
opposition demonstration in front of the National 
Assembly, and had surrounded their party offices. 
Recognizing that the police would probably raid their 
headquarters as well, Khachatryan and several other APP 
members locked themselves in Khachatryan\'s office and 
barricaded the door with a table and some chairs.  The 
police arrived at approximately 2:30 a.m.  Khachatryan 
said she could hear them cursing loudly and breaking 
things in the office.  The police called on those in 
Khachatryan\'s office to open the door, and that they 
only intended to ask a few questions and not hurt 
anyone.  When Khachatryan refused to open the door, the 
police quickly broke it down. 
 
------------------- 
ARREST LIST ALLEGED 
------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) According to Khachatryan, the police that 
entered the room were both uniformed and plainclothes 
and most carried batons.  In total, she estimated that 
approximately 20 police officers were in the APP 
office.  Khachatryan says she witnessed the police 
singling out males present in the APP headquarters to 
beat with the batons, claiming that Felix Khachatryan, 
the APP member of the Central Election Commission, was 
bleeding from a head wound he received from a 
policeman\'s baton.  Khachatryan told us that some of 
the police sacked the offices, breaking furniture, and 
taking videotapes and party documents.  Khachatryan 
said that the commander of the central Yerevan police 
station led the operation, and he entered the 
headquarters with a list of names of those to be 
detained.  Khachatryan estimates that the raid took 30 
minutes and that she and other APP members were taken 
into police custody at 3:00 a.m. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
MOVING FROM THE INITIAL INTERROGATION... 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The police took Khachatryan to the central 
police precinct.  She said she was immediately taken 
into an interrogation room, where a police investigator 
informed she was being held as a witness in a criminal 
investigation of the opposition Justice Bloc. 
Khachatryan told us that the investigator had a typed 
list of questions that he read:  \"Why did you call for 
the violent overthrow of the government?\" \"Why did you 
participate in an unsanctioned rally?\" \"Who are the 
chief organizers of the illegal rallies?\" \"Who printed 
the anti-government leaflets announcing the time and 
location of rallies?\"  Khachatryan said she denied any 
illegal activity for five hours as different 
interrogators continuously repeated the questions. 
 
--------------------------- 
...TO WITNESS, TO SUSPECT... 
--------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) At 8:00 a.m. Khachatryan said a policeman 
escorted her to the office of the same police commander 
who led the raid on APP headquarters.  The commander 
told her that she was no longer being held as a 
witness, but was now formally charged with attempting 
to overthrow the constitutional order.  He told her 
that several large file folders on his desk were filled 
with police information on the senior leadership of the 
Justice Bloc; Khachatryan described the whole episode 
as an \"act of intimidation.\"  A procurator arrived and 
also informed her that she had been charged. 
Khachatryan requested a lawyer, and provided the name 
of Tigran Ter-Yesayan, President of the International 
Union of Advocates.  She told us Ter-Yesayan never came 
to the police station.  (Note:  Ter-Yesayan told a 
representative of ABA/CEELI in Armenia that the police 
had contacted him about representing Khachatryan.  He 
went to the central police station and was not allowed 
to see Khachatryan.  He waited two hours before 
leaving.  End Note.)  Khachatryan said she refused to 
answer any questions until she had a lawyer present. 
 
-------------- 
...AND RELEASE 
-------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Khachatryan told us she was transported to a 
pre-detention facility at 7:00 p.m. April 13.  The 
police at the facility gave her a large cell for four 
people to herself.  She was not interrogated again, and 
treated generally well by the police.  Khachatryan said 
she was given plenty of food, coffee and cigarettes. 
She described the whole process as \"annoying\" but not 
threatening.  At 2:00 p.m. on April 14, a procurator 
arrived and told her she would be released.  He asked 
her to sign a paper acknowledging she understood that 
she was no longer considered a suspect and allowed to 
leave the facility. 
 
----------------------- 
SOME ELEMENTS CONFIRMED 
----------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) While it is impossible to corroborate 
Khachatryan\'s overall description of the raid and her 
detention, we can confirm certain elements.  We 
observed the state of the APP headquarters at noon on 
April 13, and the offices had certainly been ransacked 
(reftel).  Kentron television station broadcast images 
of the interior of the APP offices that showed broken 
doors and furniture.   Other APP members have told us 
that Felix Khachatryan was injured in the police raid, 
and several newspapers carried photos of his bloodied 
shirt that had been left at APP headquarters.

1. (C) Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian discussed his April 
11-12 visit to Iran with Ambassador April 13, providing 
details on his meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister 
Kharrazi.  According to Oskanian, Kharrazi said that Iran is 
not supporting Shia insurgents in Iraq and feels the current 
situation in the country \"will get worse.\"  Oskanian told us 
Kharrazi also said he believes that Pakistan has not been a 
full partner in the war on terror and that the Taliban are 
\"making a comeback\" in Afghanistan.  Kharrazi further told 
Oskanian that Iran\'s pursuit of nuclear technology is 
peaceful and part of a five-year plan to boost domestic 
energy production.  End Summary.

IRAQ 
---- 
 
2. (C) Oskanian told the Ambassador that Foreign Minister 
Kharrazi told him that the Shia in Iraq had not requested 
assistance from Iran.  Oskanian said he had \"the impression\" 
that Iran is in contact with the militant Shia groups. 
Oskanian told us that Kharrazi indicated that the United 
States had not asked for Iran\'s assistance in quelling the 
Shia insurgency, but could provide help if asked.  Oskanian 
said Kharrazi believes that the situation in Iraq \"will get 
worse\" and that Iran does not see how the current conflict 
will \"soon die down.\"  Oskanian said he spoken with several 
senior Iranian officials, including one from the intelligence 
service, who said they hoped that American forces should stay 
in Iraq \"for a while\" to provide stability in the region, but 
stick to the June 30 timetable to transfer authority to a new 
Iraqi government.  With a successful transfer of power, 
Kharrazi told Oskanian, the insurgents\' position could be 
undercut.  Senior Iranian officials also told Oskanian that 
they were prepared to help with the reconstruction of Iraq to 
include energy, transportation and road projects, and 
emphasized that they could achieve positive results in Iraq 
if asked.

AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN

3. (C) Oskanian said he spoke briefly with Kharrazi about the 
situation Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Oskanian told the 
Ambassador that the Iranians believe that the Taliban is 
\"making a comeback\" in Afghanistan.  According to Oskanian, 
Kharrazi also said that Pakistan \"is closing its eyes to a 
lot of issues\" and \"is not being forthcoming\" in all it knows 
about terrorist activities. 
 
-------------- 
NUCLEAR ISSUES 
-------------- 
 
4. (C) Oskanian told the Ambassador that he spoke at length 
with Kharrazi about Iran\'s pursuit of nuclear energy 
technology.  Kharrazi assured Oskanian that the construction 
of nuclear facilities is purely peaceful and part of a 
five-year plan to boost domestic energy consumption. 
Kharrazi told Oskanian that Iran currently exports half of 
the oil it produces, but within two years production could 
barely satisfy domestic demand.  Kharrazi said that Iran 
intends to become less dependent on domestic oil production, 
and the building of nuclear power plants is part of this goal 
along with the construction of 80 new hydroelectric projects.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Opposition leaders have made a national 
referendum of confidence on President Kocharian one of 
their key demands during their anti-government 
demonstrations of the past month.  The Constitutional 
Court first raised the idea following the disputed 2003 
elections; the government, however, rightly contends 
that such a referendum would be unconstitutional. 
Opposition leaders have dodged questions regarding the 
legality of the proposal.   End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT PROVIDES OPPOSITION AN OPENING 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
3. (SBU) The Constitutional Court first presented the 
idea of a national referendum on the presidential 
administration as a comment on its April 2003 decision 
on the Armenian presidential elections.  The Court, in 
affirming Kocharian\'s legitimacy and the validity of 
the election results, made a non-binding suggestion 
that a national referendum on the government\'s 
legitimacy could be held.  The Court Chairman, Gagik 
Harutunian, noted at the time that no provision in 
Armenian law or Constitution permitted the holding of a 
\"Referendum of Confidence.\"  Opposition deputies placed 
the issue of the referendum on the National Assembly\'s 
agenda during its Fall 2003 session.  When the 
governing coalition refused to consider the measure for 
the Spring 2004 session, opposition deputies walked out 
of the chamber February 2, 2004 and initiated a boycott 
of parliamentary sessions. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
NO ROOM FOR REFERENDUM IN CONSTITUTION? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The Kocharian administration and the governing 
coalition contend that the concept of a \"Referendum of 
Confidence\" runs contrary to explicit provisions of the 
Armenian Constitution of 1995.  The Constitution states 
that referenda are required to amend the Constitution 
and may be held at the discretion of the president or 
parliament on certain laws.  The Constitution does not 
mention the use of referenda for other purposes.  The 
Constitution also provides for a detailed process of 
removing the President from office for \"state treason 
or other serious crimes.\"  The process to impeach and 
remove from office (a majority vote of the National 
Assembly to impeach followed by a formal finding by the 
Constitutional Court followed by a second vote in the 
National Assembly) does not include a national 
referendum.  (Note:  The 1991 \"Law on Referenda\" 
permits a broader scope for national referenda, but the 
subsequent 1995 Constitution states, \"The Constitution 
of the Republic has the highest legal force... Laws 
found to contradict the Constitution as well as other 
legal acts found to contradict the Constitution and the 
law have no legal force.\"  The provisions of the 1991 
law that contradict the constitution are thus not 
valid.  End Note.) 
 
-------------------------- 
OPPOSITION ON SHAKY GROUND 
-------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The opposition deputy who drafted the proposal 
for the \"Referendum of Confidence\" told us that some 
constitutional grounds for the referendum exist.  He 
pointed to Article 2 of the Constitution that states, 
\"The people exercise their authority through free 
elections and referenda,\" arguing that the provision 
permits a wider scope for referenda.  The same deputy, 
however, conceded that the Constitution seemingly did 
not provide room for a referendum of confidence.  He 
told a National Democratic Institute representative 
that the opposition really wanted the National Assembly 
to simply debate the referendum, recognizing that the 
government coalition would vote it down anyway.  He 
said that he believed that the Constitutional Court had 
unintentionally created an opening for the opposition 
to exploit.  Armenian People\'s Party leader Stepan 
Demirchian has also dodged questions about the proposed 
referendum\'s constitutionality, noting last week that 
the government\'s \"illegal arrests and rigged elections\" 
were also unconstitutional. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
COMMENT: WITHOUT AMENDMENT, REFERENDUM EXTRA-LEGAL 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6. (SBU) Though some have pointed to the national 
referendum of confidence as a means to resolve the 
current political impasse between the administration 
and the opposition, such a move would not only be 
unprecedented, but extra-legal.  We agree that the 
Armenian Constitution makes no provision for such an 
extraordinary referendum.  In order for a referendum of 
confidence to have legal standing, the National 
Assembly would have to first give its consent for the 
necessary amendment, which itself must be put forward 
as a national referendum.  The Constitutional Court did 
seemingly step outside of its bounds in advancing the 
idea last year, but the court\'s judges\' subsequent 
statements indicate that they did not foresee the 
consequences of their non-binding suggestion.  For 
their part, opposition leaders have been willing to 
accept the court\'s political gift, and have used the 
government\'s refusal to call the measure to a 
parliamentary vote as further fuel for their anti- 
Kocharian campaign.  To date, however, the opposition 
has not introduced the necessary pre-requisite 
constitutional amendment that would give legal standing 
to a referendum.

2. (SBU) Now that the dust has settled, the 
government has released most opposition activists, 
and subsequent rallies have proceeded without 
incident, the lack of genuine opposition unity or a 
realistic game plan is becoming more apparent.  By 
insisting that President Kocharian resign and 
calling for a referendum for which there is no legal 
basis (septel) the opposition has left itself little 
political space in which to maneuver.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
RECENT RALLIES MODEST, MOSTLY CALM 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Approximately 3000 opposition supporters 
demonstrated at 6:00 p.m. on April 16, with the 
rally proceeding for ninety minutes in steady rain, 
with opposition leaders Stepan Demirchian, Artashes 
Geghamian and Aram Sargsyan urging their supporters 
to keep up the pressure on President Kocharian, and 
condemning the police actions against the opposition 
during the week.  Opposition supporters had planned 
to hold the unauthorized rally in Opera Square, but 
were turned away by police who had scheduled a 
concert in the Opera to mark National Police Day. 
The demonstrators then marched on the sidewalk to 
the nearby park in front on the National Manuscript 
Museum without incident.  Approximately 30 police 
(wearing regular uniforms, not riot gear) kept the 
demonstrators from spilling into the street.  One 
police officer told us that he had been instructed 
by his superiors to not carry his baton or any other 
weapon.  The rally concluded at approximately 8:00 
p.m., and the demonstrators dispersed without 
incident. 
 
4. (SBU) The rally April 21 attracted some 5000 to 
7000 supporters, who listened to several hours of 
speeches and then proceeded to march in a roughly 
one-mile circuit around downtown Yerevan.  Although 
the demonstrators seriously impeded traffic during 
their march in the streets officials did not 
interfere in any way:  we even observed the police 
stopping traffic so the demonstrators could pass 
safely through intersections.  By the end of the 
march, fewer than 1000 protestors remained, with the 
evening ending peacefully (the march concluded at 
slightly after 9:30 p.m. local time). 
 
---------------------------------- 
OPPOSITION SPLIT ON THE NEXT STEPS 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The opposition is split on whether or not 
to carry through on its call for a rally and march 
on April 24, Armenian Genocide Memorial Day. 
Sources within the opposition tell us that Stepan 
Demirchian and Vazgen Manukian oppose the plan to 
march in force past the Presidential Palace to the 
Genocide Memorial, believing that any attempt to 
politicize the memorial would backfire.  According 
to these same opposition staffers, Aram Sargsian and 
Artashes Geghamian, on the other hand, are anxious 
to provoke a confrontation with the authorities and 
are pushing hard to organize a highly public rally 
and march.  We believe that, were the opposition to 
attempt to use Armenia\'s most solemn holiday for 
political gain, the potential for increased tensions 
and possible violence could be significant. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  NO PLAN FOR WHERE TO GO FROM HERE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) We believe that the opposition, never 
genuinely unified, is already starting to show its 
ideological cracks.  With Demirchian and Manukian 
lining up against their colleagues more inclined to 
confrontation, Sargsian and Geghamian, we see little 
evidence of agreement even on tactical issues. 
Kocharian won\'t need to pack his bags just yet.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Post has consistently discredited recent media 
reports about the ten-year-old proposal to build a pipeline 
from Iran to Armenia on the grounds that there has been no 
indication of a source for the USD 120 million to build the 
Armenian portion of the pipeline.  Although we still believe 
that the Armenian government has no money for the project, 
recent comments made by the Foreign Minister, the Iran desk 
officer and the Ministry of Energy suggest that  officials 
in the government are themselves convinced that they will 
find funding.  Suggestions of an electricity for gas swap 
persist despite denials by the Ministry of Energy.  So for 
argument\'s sake we will assume that the government is able 
and willing to spend USD 120 million to build its portion of 
the pipeline--What then?  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
STILL LOOKING FOR MONEY... 
------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) On April 22, 2004, a resident Amcit who represents 
a U.S.-based foundation, called on the Ambassador to discuss 
the potential pipeline deal.  According to the American, the 
Foreign Minister asked him for technical and financial 
advice in connection with GOAM efforts to raise the money to 
pay for a pipeline bringing Turkmen gas through Iran to 
Armenia.  He noted that the Government of Armenia was 
searching for help and advice on how to finance the proposed 
pipeline.  (Note:  The Amcit was concerned about U.S. policy 
and law and indicated after our conversation he would not be 
engaging in this area.  End Note.) 
 
----------------- 
...BUT OPTIMISTIC 
----------------- 
 
4. (SBU) High-level Armenian officials are more and more 
confident that they will somehow find the money to pay for 
the Iran-Armenia pipeline.  In a recent interview, President 
Kocharian acknowledged a preliminary deal with Iran on the 
pipeline.  Just back from a state visit to Iran, the Foreign 
Minister, Vartan Oskanian, told the Ambassador that the 
Iranian Minister of Oil would visit Yerevan May to sign a 
final deal.  Asked about the money to build the pipeline, \"I 
think the money will appear somewhere,\" he said.  Similarly, 
Garnik Badalian, Iran Desk Officer at the MFA, told us that 
after the Iranian Minister\'s visit, the government was 
planning to launch a feasibility study on the pipeline. 
According to Badalian, the discussion so far has included 
\"no specific financial negotiations\" and it has just been 
assumed that each side will build its own part. 
 
------------------------- 
ELECTRICITY FOR GAS SWAP? 
------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Reports that Iran and Armenia intend to sign a deal 
to swap electricity for gas are persistent.  Both the 
Foreign Minister and the MFA\'s Iran desk officer raised the 
idea, saying that both sides agree in principle to such an 
arrangement.  \"Bull****,\" said Deputy Minister of Energy 
Areg Galstyan when we called to confirm the report.  (Note: 
Galstyan insists that he is one of three people privy to the 
details of the negotiations.  End Note.)  Badalian added 
that there would be a lot of problems to be worked out in 
any swap deal.  Not least must be the fact that the 
Government of Armenia doesn\'t own the electricity and the 
Government of Iran doesn\'t own the gas.  The GOAM has 
privatized the lion\'s share of Armenia\'s electricity 
generation resources, and RAO UES, a Russian energy company, 
controls 80 percent of it.  Those assets remaining in the 
government\'s control, notably the Vorotan Cascade hydro 
plant, generate too little electricity (between 700 and 1300 
GWh per year, depending on water levels) to exchange for 
substantial amounts of gas.  If Iran were to purchase gas 
from Turkmenistan to exchange with Armenia at a set rate for 
electricity, it would expose itself to risk based on the 
fluctuations in the gas market.  Ultimately, any swap would 
have to involve private actors on both ends. 
 
------------------------ 
WHAT IF RAO IS INVOLVED? 
------------------------ 
 
6. (SBU) Assuming RAO UES and the gas supplier could be 
involved, would the swap reasonable?  Iran and Armenia have 
been swapping electricity for years, with Armenia sending 
excess electricity to Iran during Iran\'s peak usage in 
summer in exchange for electricity in winter, Armenia\'s peak 
usage time.  Armenia\'s excess generating capacity during 
summer, Iran\'s peak usage time, is roughly 200 MW, enough 
for considerable electricity transfers abroad.  It is gas- 
fired energy (which is more expensive than nuclear or hydro- 
electricity) that composes any margin of extra electricity 
that Armenia produces, thus any export of electricity 
necessarily involves burning gas to generate that extra 
electricity.  In order for this to justify the expense of 
building the pipeline, Armenia would have to receive 
significantly more gas than is necessary to produce the 
electricity it exchanges, an unlikely long-term deal. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
IRAN COULD BE CHEAPER WAY TO GET TURKMEN GAS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Nonetheless, once built the pipeline could be a 
cheaper way to get gas from Turkmenistan.  The gas that 
Armenia currently receives through the pipeline from Russia 
through Georgia is also from Turkmenistan.  Its price at the 
Armenian border is USD 55.00 per thousand cubic meters; the 
wellhead price is USD 42.50.  Assuming that the transit this 
way could capture USD 10 per thousand cubic meters, gas 
could arrive more cheaply than from the current pipeline. 
At the full capacity of 1.5 billion cubic meters per year, 
there could be USD 15 million per year in transit revenue-- 
arguably enough to justify the USD 100 million to build the 
Iranian side of the pipeline. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  (SBU) While it is clear that the Armenians want the 
pipeline, it is equally clear that many of the important 
details, such as paying for the pipeline and for the gas 
after that, have yet to be worked out.  In one step towards 
reality the President has scotched all talk of the pipeline 
continuing through Armenia to serve Georgia and Europe. 
While reports of a swap of gas for electricity appear to be 
not entirely credible, it is possible that the governments 
will add, as part of the contract, terms of trade for swaps 
of small amounts to cover Iran\'s energy shortages in the 
summer.  Whether or not Armenia manages to find the money to 
begin construction on a pipeline this year, its long-term 
strategy must include some diversified energy sources. 
Looking forward to the inevitable, if deferred, closure of 
the Armenia Nuclear Power Plant, the GOAM remains unwilling 
to depend on the single gas pipeline through Georgia for 80 
percent of its energy needs.

SUBJECT: REACTION FROM YEREVAN, ARMENIA: PRESS 
CONFERENCE OF AMBASSADOR JOHN ORDWAY 
 
1.  SUMMARY: All mass media widely covered Ambassador 
John Ordway\'s press conference held on April 22.  TV 
reports were mainly accurate and factual.  The press 
carried fewer commentaries this time than it has in the 
past.  The majority of the newspapers quoted the 
Ambassador without any comments.  Unlike previous press 
conferences with a wide range of questions asked by the 
journalists, the main topics discussed this time were 
the internal political situation in the country, the 
Armenian Genocide issue and a little bit about Armenian- 
Turkish relations.  Virtually all the papers noted the 
balanced U.S. position expressed by the Ambassador with 
regard to the political situation in Armenia.  The 
following is a summary of some of the articles. END 
SUMMARY 
 
THE AMBASSADOR TRIED TO LOOK NEUTRAL 
 
2. Oppositionist Armenian daily HAYKAKAN ZHAMANAK 
(04/23) tried to emphasize those parts of the answers 
that discussed the policy conducted by the authorities. 
\"The leitmotiv of the Ambassador\'s answers was the 
necessity of avoiding violence and beginning a dialogue 
between the authorities and opposition.\"  \"The 
Ambassador\'s words on beginning a dialogue were more 
probably addressed to the authorities.\"  \"It was 
obvious that for the Ambassador a principal issue was 
not to make any statement that would express support 
for any side.  However, he mentioned several times that 
certain actions by the authorities do not assist in 
beginning a dialogue.  The Ambassador asked a 
rhetorical question - whether it is possible to expect 
that the opposition would engage in a dialogue, when, 
for example, the offices of the opposition parties are 
being raided.\" 
 
\"WE HOPE THAT THE EVENTS OF APRIL 13 WOULD NOT BE 
REPEATED\" 
 
3. Centrist Armenian language daily AZG (04/23) wrote: 
\"The monthly press conference of U.S. Ambassador John 
Ordway was entirely about the internal political 
situation of the country.  There was obviously a need 
for a press conference taking into account recent 
publications in local as well as foreign press saying 
that the current situation in Armenia is another 
version of the Georgian revolution and is the result of 
cooperation between the opposition and the U.S. 
National Democratic Institute and the Soros Foundation. 
As expected, the Ambassador denied this.\"  \"During this 
period the Ambassador had several meetings with 
representatives of the opposition and the authorities. 
His position coincided with the formulation widely 
circulated today, that is, real political processes 
would start only through dialogue.\"  \"However, is it 
possible to start a dialogue in a deadlocked situation, 
when the positions of the opposition and the 
authorities do not contain tolerance for each other, 
especially after the April 13 events?\"  \"The Ambassador 
insisted on his opinion, saying that the grounds for a 
dialogue should be laid by the authorities first of 
all.\"  \"Remaining loyal to the spirit of the U.S. State 
Department statement, John Ordway repeated that they 
think that all the arrested people should be released 
and the raids and closure of party offices is not 
acceptable.  Without doubt, the Ambassador talked about 
this with the RA President.  However, the Ambassador 
did not think it right to give details of that talk. 
He just said that the private talks had positive 
results.\" 
 
\"THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE WAY IS THROUGH A DIALOGUE\" 
 
4. Russian language pro-government RESPUBLIKA ARMENIA 
(04/23) wrote: \"U.S. Ambassador John Ordway started the 
regular monthly press conference with his welcome in 
Armenian.  After that he invited the journalists to ask 
questions.\"  \"Asked how important are the demands by 
the opposition and whether the opposition provided 
grounds for violence, the Ambassador smiled and said 
that the opposition should ask itself these questions.\" 
 
U.S. OFFICIAL URGES `RESTRAINT\' IN ARMENIAN STANDOFF 
 
5. The Radio Liberty web-site published an article on 
the press conference.  \"Ordway also renewed U.S. calls 
for a dialogue between the two rival camps.  But he 
would not be drawn on what specific compromise deals 
could resolve the lingering tensions which might again 
flare up into a violent confrontation next week. 
Ordway implied that both sides are to blame for the 
violence, saying that they should now `ask themselves 
some questions about their activities on that night\' 
and act in `in a responsible manner that avoids 
violence and confrontation.\'  But echoing an April 15 
statement by the State Department, he did criticize 
police raids on opposition offices and mass arrests 
that followed the troubled anti-Kocharian protest. 
Washington is thought to have played a major role in 
the bloodless overthrow of then Georgian President 
Eduard Shevardnadze, but seems to be walking a more 
delicate line in Armenia.\"  \"In a commentary published 
by `The Wall Street Journal\' last week, David Phillips 
of America\'s influential Council on Foreign Relations 
called for an internationally supervised referendum of 
confidence in `Mr. Kocharian\'s corrupt and inept 
administration.\'  Ordway made it clear that the 
government-connected scholar\'s views do not reflect the 
official U.S. policy on Armenia.\"

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) On April 26, Foreign Minister Vartan 
Oskanian convoked the diplomatic corps ahead of 
planned opposition rallies for April 27.  Reading 
from a non paper (text below) Oskanian indicated 
that if the opposition carries out its threat to 
encircle the presidential office to prevent the 
President from entering upon his return from Europe 
later this week, Kocharian will invoke Article 55 of 
the Constitution that, \"in the event of an immediate 
danger to the constitutional order,\" permits him to 
\"take measures appropriate to the situation.\" 
Following Oskanian\'s statement, the newly appointed 
Procurator General Aghvan Hovsepian provided the 
legal framework for this potential action. In 
closing Oskanian noted that this is a \"seemingly 
critical period in Armenian history\" and called on 
the diplomatic community to help the government to 
\"maintain stability.\"  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
TEXT OF GOAM NON-PAPER 
---------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The English-language text of the non-paper 
that Foreign Minister Oskanian gave the diplomatic 
corps follows.  Begin Text: 
 
-- The opposition has been holding public rallies 
and unreservedly calling for the president\'s 
resignation, to be achieved forcefully if necessary. 
 
-- Since such calls are unconstitutional, the 
organizers have been denied permits to hold public 
gatherings.  Nevertheless, rallies have been held 
and for the most part, without interference by the 
authorities. 
 
-- On the night of April 12-13, the opposition went 
beyond words, and disturbed the peace and the normal 
activities of the citizenry.  At that time, the 
police had no choice but to take steps to disperse 
the crowd. 
 
-- We appreciate the concern and attention of the 
international community to these events, have taken 
note of their content, and understand fully the 
clear call for restraint and negotiations. 
 
-- What was missing from the statements of the 
international community was a clear condemnation of 
resorting to forceful change of government.  This 
has been understood by some in the opposition as 
tacit affirmation of their positions. 
 
-- Although the various elements of the opposition 
have united, and although they have been attempting 
to rally public support for a whole year, those 
gathered for these demonstrations remain a very 
small minority of the population, having at no time 
exceeded 7,000 or 8,000, by even the most liberal 
counts. 
 
-- The opposition has rejected all calls by the 
members of the ruling coalition and the government 
to enter into a dialogue.  The Coalition partners in 
the National Assembly have offered the opposition-- 
which is a minority in the National Assembly--veto 
rights in three of the most contentious matters that 
will be placed before the assembly:  electoral 
reform, constitutional reform, and legislative 
reform to support the anti-corruption strategy.  The 
opposition has rejected this offer. 
 
-- According to our information, the opposition\'s 
plans for the demonstration to be held on April 27 
are most extreme and will inevitably result in a 
confrontation with the authorities.  The plan, 
called Operation Ring, has also been leaked to the 
press.  It calls for encircling the presidential 
offices from both ends of Baghramian Avenue, and 
Demirchian Avenue, so that President Kocharian will 
be unable to enter the building when he returns from 
his European trip. 
 
-- This action is seen by the authorities to be a 
threat to the maintenance of public order.  Such 
action contradicts not only Armenian law but also 
international norms which stress that the exercise 
of freedoms carries with it duties and 
responsibilities as prescribed by law, and necessary 
in a democratic society in the interests of national 
security and public safety. 
 
-- If the opposition follows through with their 
plan, the President will invoke Article 55/14 of the 
Constitution of the Republic of Armenia which 
states:  \"In the event of an immediate danger to the 
constitutional order and upon consultations with the 
president of the National Assembly and the Prime 
Minister, [the President] shall take measures 
appropriate to the situation and address the people 
on this subject.\" 
 
-- No democracy will tolerate attempts to forcefully 
change constitutionally elected officials.  The 
opposition insists that the presidential election of 
2003 was not legitimate.  Yet despite observations 
of irregularities, no international observer group 
claimed that the results did not reflect the will of 
the people.  The opposition is resorting to 
unconstitutional steps to pursue personal vendettas, 
and does not enjoy broad-based popular support. 
 
-- Armenia will continue to expand its democratic 
institutions, go forward with its Council of Europe 
obligations in reinforcing human and civil rights. 
 
-- For Armenia to be able to further deepen these 
processes and systems, we need an opposition that is 
constructively engaged.  Unfortunately, the 
leadership of Armenia\'s opposition has taken an 
entirely different path. 
 
-- The Armenian government continues to call on 
members of the opposition to resist unconstitutional 
acts and not to resort to violence to achieve their 
aims.  The rights of journalists and those 
peacefully assembled will be respected.  Those who 
have heretofore acted unlawfully and prevented the 
right of journalists to free access are being 
investigated and will be punished within the 
provisions of the law. 
 
-- The Armenian government calls on the 
international community to understand the causes of 
the current situation and engage positively in 
trying to prevent such excessive, unrealistic, 
legally unacceptable and politically baseless 
machinations.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Against the backdrop of the opposition call 
for \"the last stand\" on April 27, National Assembly 
Speaker Artur Baghdasaryan has called a meeting with 
the opposition to discuss the current political 
situation.  The opposition rally and likely march 
April 27, and the government\'s response to it, will 
likely determine the nature of the political 
dialogue (or lack thereof) for the near term.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
BAGHDASARYAN TRYING TO MEDIATE 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) (SBU) In his April 23 press conference 
National Assembly Speaker Artur Baghdasaryan (and 
senior member of the governing coalition) offered to 
meet with opposition leaders April 26 and also 
condemned the authorities\' heavy-handed tactics 
against the opposition.  Baghdasaryan used a power- 
point presentation to describe the chain of events 
since the 2003 elections that he believed had led to 
current political impasse.  He criticized the 
government for overreacting to the current political 
situation, saying, \"The guillotine is not the best 
means of treating dandruff.\"  The Speaker noted that 
the escalating confrontation could have serious 
consequences, namely Armenia\'s expulsion from the 
Council of Europe. 
 
----------------------------------- 
OPPOSITION AGREES TO ATTEND MEETING 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Opposition leaders told us that they would 
send two representatives to meet with National 
Assembly (NA) Speaker Baghdasaryan in the evening of 
April 26.  Baghdasaryan and senior coalition members 
of the NA told the Ambassador April 24 that they 
were trying to broker a discussion in order to move 
the political process back into the \"political 
sphere\" rather than let the situation devolve into a 
police matter. 
 
----------------------------------- 
APRIL 27 DEMONSTRATIONS WILL BE KEY 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Opposition leaders tell us that they have 
not yet decided exactly what they will do tomorrow 
(April 27) when they gather to demonstrate, but 
every indication we have leads us to believe that 
they intend to march on the Presidential Palace. 
They have announced plans in the press to encircle 
the Presidential Palace and maintain their positions 
so that the President will not have access when he 
returns from a European trip later this week.  As 
the Foreign Minister announced to the diplomatic 
corps (septel), the GOAM has clearly laid down a 
line for the opposition -- government and opposition 
behavior over the course of the next 24 to 48 hours 
will be crucial in setting the scene for either 
political discourse or possible violence.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Following two days of meetings between the 
opposition and the governing coalition, the 
opposition\'s April 27 rally of about 5000 
participants went off without incident but with 15 
people taken to the police the next day (April 28), 
questioned and subsequently released.  Over the past 
two weeks, authorities have arrested six opposition 
supporters on criminal charges.  Without being able 
to provide precise numbers, the Human Rights 
Ombudsman\'s office reports that the majority of 
opposition supporters detained administratively have 
been released.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
BAGHDASARIAN MEETS WITH OPPOSITION 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) National Assembly Speaker Artur 
Baghdasarian chaired meetings April 26 and 27 
including members of all parliamentary factions as 
well as opposition politician Victor Dalakyan and a 
representative of the National Unity Party.  During 
the meetings Dalakyan reportedly presented the 
following demands: 
 
-- Release all detainees; 
-- Stop political prosecutions; 
-- Ensure the constitutional rights of citizens 
(freedom of movement, assembly and speech); 
-- Withdraw the current bill on rallies and 
demonstrations from consideration at the NA; 
-- Debate proposed referendum of confidence 
legislation; 
-- Provide access to live broadcast time to the 
opposition on state television broadcasts; 
-- Ensure that those who violated election law 
during the 2003 elections are punished; and 
-- Drop all legal cases against opposition 
supporters. 
 
4. (SBU) Although the opposition has announced 
strong disappointment that the governing coalition 
has not agreed to its demands wholesale, the 
opposition has also announced that it will \"give the 
government one more week\" (until May 4) to meet its 
demands and seems to be willing to at least consider 
participating in a political dialogue on some 
issues.  In a meeting with us April 28, one of the 
opposition parliamentarians hinted that the 
opposition might be looking for a face-saving way to 
end their boycott of the National Assembly. 
 
------------------------------------ 
LACKLUSTER RALLY, FEW NEW DETENTIONS 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) The opposition\'s April 27 rally at Opera 
Square attracted roughly 5000 demonstrators, who 
listened to three hours of speeches politely, then 
dispersed.  (Note:  The opposition\'s sound system 
once again failed to work consistently, making many 
of the speeches difficult, if not impossible, to 
follow.  End Note.)  We noted little enthusiasm in 
the largely older, unemployed and male crowd, with 
most participants carrying on extended and loud 
conversations with the people standing near them 
rather than paying attention to the speakers.  We 
spoke with various opposition party headquarters 
April 28 and they reported 15 new detentions in 
Yerevan following the April 27 rally (with all 15 
released following questioning).  Opposition leaders 
report additional detentions of party activists 
outside of Yerevan, for a total of 35. 
 
------------------------------ 
OMBUDSMAN ON DETENTION NUMBERS 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (SBU) According to Human Rights Ombudsman Larissa 
Alaverdian and her staff, over the course of the 
past several weeks roughly 200-300 people have been 
administratively detained, with about 80 percent of 
them held briefly and released (some protesters have 
been fined the equivalent of USD 1 to USD 4).  The 
Ombudsman has no exact numbers of those in 
administrative detention at the end of April 28, but 
estimates that it could be no more than 50, and is 
likely considerably fewer.  Over the past two weeks, 
authorities have arrested six opposition supporters 
on criminal charges ranging from weapons charges to 
charges of attempting to overthrow the government by 
non-constitutional means. 
 
------------------------------- 
COMMENT: LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT? 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) In announcing its intention to give the 
government a week to meet its demands the opposition 
appears to be looking for a way to back off slightly 
from its previous uncompromising positions.  The 
lack of wide-spread public support for the 
opposition\'s as-yet-unformulated program for its 
next steps undoubtedly played a role in the 
opposition\'s decision to lower the rhetorical 
temperature for the time being.  The police\'s 
decision to detain political activists yet again, 
however briefly, following the April 27 rally is 
disquieting, and a measure of how far apart the two 
sides remain.

2. (SBU) The Head of the NATO Division at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Hrachia Tashchian, presented us with the 
Ministry\'s \"Fact Sheet on Cooperation of Armenia with NATO 
and its Participation in the Partnership for Peace 
Programme.\"  Tashchian told us that Foreign Minister 
Oskanian believed that increased cooperation with NATO 
should be one of the highest priorities of Armenian foreign 
policy.  Tashchian said that he had been tasked with 
developing further plans for increased NATO engagement, and 
had prepared the document as an initial briefing for 
diplomats, parliamentarians, and government officials. 
3. (SBU) Begin text of MFA document: 
 
Fact Sheet on Cooperation of Armenia with NATO and its 
Participation in the Partnership for Peace Programme 
 
Armenia is an active NATO partner.  In 2003, high- 
ranking NATO officials praised Armenia as the most 
improved nation in terms of dynamics of partnership 
and cooperation.  Most Armenia-NATO activities fall 
under the Partnership for Peace programme. 
 
Main Armenia-NATO agreements include: 
 
- In October 2002, Armenia joined the Planning and 
Review Process (PARP) programme, in which 21 
countries participate today.  Armenia participates in 
PARP with one motorized infantry battalion, as well 
as one combat engineer platoon, three combat support 
platoons, one NBC detection team, one logistic 
company, and one medical platoon. 
 
- In 2003, Armenia made a decision to participate in 
NATO-led peacekeeping operation in Kosovo (KFOR). 
Since February 2004, a platoon of thirty-four 
peacekeepers from the Armenian Armed Forces is 
operating as part of the Greek forces of the U.S.-led 
multinational brigade in KFOR. 
 
- Armenia has taken a decision to participate in 
peacekeeping and reconstruction in Iraq by allocating 
forces to the military contingent headed by Poland 
and operating with NATO assistance.  Armenia is 
planning the deployment of a transport platoon, and 
one team of de-mining engineers, and a medical unit 
to Iraq during 2004. 
 
- In 2003, Armenia signed the PfP Status of forces 
Agreement (SOFA), which was ratified by the National 
Assembly of Armenia 30 March 2004. 
 
Each year, Armenia participates in several events 
within the PfP framework, including military 
exercises, training programmes and seminars.  Some 
highlights include the following: 
 
- In 2003, Armenia host the NATO Cooperative Best 
Effort 2003 Military Exercises, in which 19 states 
participated. 
 
- Armenia intends to participate in the NATO 
Cooperative Best Effort 2004 Military Exercises to be 
hosted by Azerbaijan in September 2004. 
 
- In 2000-2003, Armenia hosted three international 
seminars organized by NATO, in which representatives 
from 25 ally and partner states participated.  An 
October 2002 seminar, Fight Against International 
Terrorism: Perspectives for Regional Cooperation, was 
the largest seminar organized by NATO in the Southern 
Caucasus. 
 
- In 2000-2003, Armenian non-governmental 
organizations held a dozen NATO sponsored seminars 
and workshops aimed at promoting civil society in 
Armenia, as well as disseminating reliable 
information on the role and policies of NATO and 
generating open debate about the security in the 
region of the Southern Caucasus. 
 
- Armenian scientific establishments and individual 
scientists are active participants of the NATO 
Science Programme.  Computer networking programme 
\"Virtual Silk Highway\"- the most significant project 
launched by NATO in the Southern Caucasus- has been 
implementing in Armenia since January of 2003. 
 
Armenia maintains a regular high-level dialogue with 
NATO, specifically: 
 
- Between 2001-2003, the NATO Secretary=General 
visited Armenia twice and the Armenia President 
visited NATO headquarters twice. 
 
- NATO-Armenia individual consultations have been 
held annually since 2001 between the delegations 
headed by NATO\'s Assistant Secretary-General and 
Armenia\'s Deputy Foreign minister. 
 
Armenia has recently appointed a Military 
Representative to NATO.  He will start performing his 
duties on 1 May 2004.  In addition, Armenia\'s 
President has approved the appointment of an 
Ambassador specifically to NATO.  This appointment is 
expected in mid-2004.  Until then, Armenia\'s 
ambassador to the EU will continue to maintain his 
NATO portfolio, through Armenia\'s Mission to NATO. 
 
Armenia attaches great importance to the 
establishment of individual relations with NATO 
seeking its support and advice in reforming and 
modernizing defense and security systems. 
Participation in the Individual Partnership Action 
Plan (IPAP) is being considered as the most relevant 
mechanism to reach this goal.  In this regard, 
Armenia intends to start negotiations on the 
elaboration of Armenia\'s IPAP shortly after the 
submission of the official application, which is 
expected in the near future.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU)  The Armenian National Assembly passed the 
controversial \"Law on the Procedure of Staging 
Meetings, Rallies, Marches and Demonstrations\" (Law on 
Rallies) in its third and final reading April 28.  The 
Law on Rallies allows demonstrations to take place 
without formal permission by the government, but places 
certain restrictions on their location.  Specific 
provisions of the Law on Rallies have drawn criticism 
from the opposition and the Council of Europe, who 
question whether authorities will use the law to 
restrict future demonstrations.  The governing 
coalition contends that the law makes it easier for 
citizens to hold rallies, and incorporates nearly all 
of the suggested amendments from international 
organizations and NGOs.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
LAW ON RALLIES PASSES 
--------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The Armenian National Assembly passed the Law 
on Rallies by a near unanimous vote April 28.  (Note: 
Opposition deputies continue their parliamentary 
boycott, and consequently did not vote on the law.  End 
Note.)  Under the provisions of the law, organizers of 
demonstrations and rallies no longer must obtain a 
government permit to hold a rally, but need only to 
notify authorities in advance of their planned action. 
All citizens are entitled to participate in rallies, 
and the police and government officials can be held 
criminally accountable for infringing on this right. 
The law places limitations on where rallies can be 
legally held without explicit government approval; 
government offices, \"cultural sites,\" and venues where 
another rally or public event is concurrently taking 
place require pre-approval from the police.  The police 
are empowered to breakup rallies and demonstrations 
that violate the law, specifically those that encourage 
violence or call for the violent overthrow of 
authorities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND GOAM SPAR OVER PROVISIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (SBU) The Law on Rallies quickly passed its final 
two readings after coming under heavy criticism from 
the Council of Europe\'s (COE) Venice Commission during 
a roundtable discussion April 22.  The COE\'s 
Representative in Armenia, Natalya Vutova, presented 
the GOAM with a formal finding by the Venice Commission 
that some provisions of the law ran contrary to the 
11th Article of the European Convention on the Right to 
Hold Meetings.  The COE document noted, \"The general 
impression and effect of the law as a whole is one 
which limits and interferes in an area which should . . 
. be allowed to be exercised without regulation.\"  The 
COE noted that authorities could use the law\'s vague 
provisions regulating the location of rallies to 
infringe upon basic freedoms of assembly and 
expression.  Deputy Speaker Tigran Torosyan angrily 
denounced the COE\'s position, contending that the 
organization was unfairly linking the current political 
upheaval in Armenia with the law.  Justice Minister 
David Harutunyan also took exception to the COE 
criticism, noting that the GOAM had been closely 
engaged with international organizations and NGOs in 
the drafting of the law and had incorporated \"90 
percent\" of the 80 amendments suggested. 
 
---------------------------------- 
LAW ADDS FUEL TO OPPOSITION\'S FIRE 
---------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) In the past week, the opposition has also 
sought to draw a link between their anti-government 
movement and the law.  Opposition leaders say that the 
law is an attempt to stifle their campaign to unseat 
President Kocharian, and had made its withdrawal from 
consideration one of their demands to the government. 
After the law passed in its second reading April 27, 
opposition leaders refused to engage in further 
negotiations with the governing coalition. 
 
-------------------- 
COMMENT: POOR TIMING 
-------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The governing coalition displayed a lack of 
political deftness in pushing through the Law on 
Rallies in the midst of the opposition demonstrations. 
Though the law had been under consideration (and 
discussion with international organizations and NGOs) 
for some time, and certain provisions enhance rather 
than curtail citizen\'s rights to engage in peaceful 
demonstrations, it provides further fuel to the 
opposition\'s campaign.  The governing coalition 
contends that a lack of other legislative agenda items 
moved up the timetable to take a final vote on the law, 
but in so doing they played into the opposition\'s 
suspicions that they were never seeking to resolve the 
political impasse or negotiate in good faith.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Armenian opposition announced a 10-day 
suspension in its protests against the presidency of 
Robert Kocharian to give the government time to comply 
with PACE Resolution 1374.  Opposition leaders 
announced the suspension to a crowd of nearly 5,000 
during a protest in central Yerevan, May 4.  After the 
rally, protesters marched by the Armenian National 
Security Service and police headquarters to protest the 
government practice of using \"administrative detention\" 
against opposition supporters.  The protest ended 
peacefully, but Post has unconfirmed reports of 
additional detentions.  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
REACTION TO PACE 
---------------- 
 
3. (SBU) In their comments to the crowd, the leaders of 
the Justice Alliance and the National Unity Party (AMK) 
frequently referred to the Parliamentary Assembly of 
the Council of Europe (PACE) resolution of last week, 
which denounced the GOAM crackdown on opposition 
activities.  The speakers called on the GOAM to comply 
with the resolution, specifically by releasing those in 
administrative detention and by ensuring freedom of 
assembly and expression.  Many of the more active 
protesters carried European Union flags.  Albert 
Bazheyan of the Justice Alliance claimed \"those [EU] 
demands are also the opposition demands.\"  The 
opposition announced the 10-day suspension of protests 
in order to give the government time to comply with the 
PACE resolution. 
 
------------------ 
MARCH AND REACTION 
------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) After the 90-minute rally, many of the 
demonstrators marched past the National Security 
Service and the central police station.  Post has no 
reports of violence during the march.  Protesters had 
been warned by the GOAM not to march down Baghramian 
Avenue toward the National Assembly and the 
Presidential Palace.  The government stationed water 
cannons, troops and police along Baghramian, but the 
protesters followed their previously announced route 
past law enforcement agencies 
 
5. (SBU) Opposition parties have not yet confirmed 
reports of 14 additional administrative detentions 
after the rally.  The number detained, if accurate, is 
significantly smaller than the thirty to forty people 
detained after each of last month\'s rallies. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) The government made no official comment on the 
opposition\'s demands, but instead has emphasized that 
the PACE resolution did not endorse a presidential 
referendum.  Since the opposition and GOAM have few 
points of contact to facilitate negotiation and because 
both sides claim victory in PACE Resolution 1374, Post 
sees little chance for compromise in the short term and 
as yet has seen no indication that the GOAM has changed 
its position since the PACE resolution.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) At his May 4 press conference Procurator 
General (PG) Aghvan Hovsepian admitted that they had as 
yet made no significant progress in the investigation 
of several high-profile cases of violence against 
journalists, a human rights activist, and a prominent 
opposition politician.  Hovsepian also announced the 
establishment of a special department to combat 
government corruption.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
NO PROGRESS IN HIGH-PROFILE INVESTIGATIONS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) PG Hovsepian\'s May 4 press conference was 
arranged to announce the establishment of a special 
anti-corruption division.  Journalists, however, showed 
more interest in the status of the investigations of 
several high-profile cases, including the March 5 
incident during an opposition rally when several well- 
muscled men attacked a group of journalists and smashed 
their cameras.  Journalists also demanded follow-up on 
the attacks on prominent human rights activist Mikael 
Danielian and opposition politician Ashot Manucharian. 
Both Danielian and Manucharian were hospitalized as a 
result of these attacks; Danielian suffered from 
concussion while Manucharian underwent maxillofacial 
surgery.  Hovsepian admitted there were no suspects or 
detainees for any of these cases despite the fact that 
journalists published photos of their assailants in 
almost every newspaper.  According to Hovsepian, \"just 
a picture is not enough.\"  Also, Hovsepian complained 
about Danielian\'s \"unwillingness to cooperate\" with law 
enforcement and referred to him slightingly as a \"grant 
eater.\" 
 
------------------------------------------ 
NEW ANTI-CORRUPTION DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHED 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4. (U) Hovsepian also announced the establishment of a 
special department within the Procurator General\'s 
office to combat government corruption.  According to 
Hovsepian, the department\'s regulatory powers will be 
clarified over the next ten days, however, there will 
be no new employees hired.  The new department will 
work undercover to reveal and/or prevent corruption in 
the judicial, tax and customs agencies, as well as the 
procuracy.

1. SUMMARY.  Project Harmony implemented an INL funded legal 
socialization project that has helped to build bridges 
between Armenian students, educators and law 
enforcement officials.  The \"ZANG\" project brought 
together secondary teachers and policemen to create off- 
line and on-line curricula on Armenian law, the role of 
the police and the rights and responsibilities of the 
individual for secondary school children as well as 
children from institutions for juvenile delinquents and 
orphans.  The project--the first of its kind in 
Armenia-put the curricula to work in 22 pilot schools 
throughout the country.  We believe that this program 
has the potential to improve the general attitude 
toward the law and law enforcement bodies among 
Armenia\'s youth.  Moreover, this project will enable 
the successor generation to become an informed, active 
participant in the fight against corruption.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  PROJECT CURRICULA.  The course consists of 8 lesson 
plans that aim to stimulate discussion and creative and 
analytical thinking while improving students\' 
understanding of the law and law enforcement officials. 
A pilot manual has been created and presented in 22 
schools throughout Armenia.  The lesson plans follow: 
 
--Lesson 1: The Law and Awareness of Youth: What is the role 
of law enforcement in everyday life and its importance? 
 
--Lesson 2: The State, the Law and Juveniles: Why do laws 
exist and how do they impact society and the 
individual? Subtopics: The Constitution, freedom, the 
law, and rights and responsibilities. 
 
--Lesson 3: Legal Process and Procedures. 
 
--Lesson 4: Corruption-Why should laws be obeyed? 
 
--Lesson 5: Making Good Choices: Smoking, Narcotics, Alcohol 
and Relevant Laws. 
 
--Lesson 6: How to Say No: Consequences of Smoking, Drinking 
and Abusing Drugs. 
 
--Lesson 7: Rules of the Road: Traffic Regulation and 
Safety. 
 
--Lesson 8: Wrapping Up: Expectations and Results.

3. Following her participation in the project\'s U.S. 
exchange component, Lt. Col. Nelli Duryan (head of the 
Juvenile Department of the National Police) redoubled 
her efforts to work with juvenile offenders and 
prevention programs.  Using what she learned during the 
program, she has initiated a series of reforms of the 
juvenile justice system.  She also assured that 
officers in the pilot regions actively participated in 
the ZANG project.

4.  Although in Soviet times the juvenile police visited 
schools and work with actual and potential juvenile 
offenders, contact was largely limited to school 
principals and teachers and did not include liaison 
with or education of children.  Under the ZANG Project, 
police officers are active participants both in the 
educational process and in the students\' discussions. 
Initially, both teachers and students were tense and 
held back their opinions.  As the course developed, 
communication greatly improved.  For example, in the 
Vardashen Special School-home to street children, 
juvenile delinquents, and children without parental 
guardians-there has been a dramatic change in the 
extent to which students are willing to express their 
opinions and ask questions of police.  Many of these 
children have had interaction (both good and bad) with 
law enforcement officials; the police officer working 
with this class informed us that after a few lessons 
some of the students admitted that they were originally 
fearful of reprisals if they were open or critical. 
Moreover, the students were fearful that police would 
attempt to use them as informants against their friends 
and acquaintances.  One student commented that he has 
learned that not all police are bad and that police 
should play an important role in society--that of 
maintaining order. 
 
5.  Police place juvenile offenders under ongoing, periodic 
surveillance.  Dealing appropriately with juvenile 
offenders, particularly once they have been paroled or 
have completed their sentence, is one area that 
continues to require improvement.  The ZANG project 
gave the Juvenile Police the opportunity to help young 
people recognize illegal and socially unacceptable 
behaviors.  This project also allows the police to take 
a proactive, preventive approach to at-risk children. 
The grandmother of one student who had served a 
juvenile sentence commented to Project Harmony that she 
was thrilled that this program is in place.  Her 
grandson brings home what he has learned in the ZANG 
lesson and enthusiastically continues his school 
discussion with her. 
 
6.  COMMENT.  During a project review workshop, police and 
educators unanimously agreed that the program was 
worthwhile and important.  Lt. Col. Duryan said that 
she is committed to continuing the ZANG project with or 
without funding.  We believe that this program can 
improve relations between Armenian law enforcement 
officials and the general public by overcoming the 
prevailing belief that the police cannot or will not 
help when needed.  Moreover, this project will engender 
responsible, law-abiding behavior in a society that has 
become used to extra judicial solutions to legal 
problems.  We look forward to the next stage of the 
project.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: REACTION FROM YEREVAN, ARMENIA: ARMENIAN MEDIA 
ON THE SITUATION IN AJARIA 
 
1.  SUMMARY: Armenian mass media widely covered the 
recent developments in Ajaria and Georgia and paid 
special attention to the resignation of Ajaria\'s 
leader, Aslan Abashidze.  The press outlined the 
importance of the recent political developments for 
their possible impact on Armenia and on the whole 
region.  The Foreign Ministry of Armenia made a short 
statement welcoming the peaceful resolution of the 
conflict. END SUMMARY 
 
STATEMENT BY ARMENIA\'S FOREIGN MINISTRY 
 
2. The Spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry said: 
\"Official Yerevan expressed satisfaction that the 
confrontation between Georgian central authorities and 
the leadership of the Adjaria autonomous region was 
resolved peacefully and without bloodshed.  Such a 
resolution was another important step on the path to 
establishing peace and stability in Georgia, and 
therefore in the whole South Caucasus.  In this regard, 
we welcome the Georgian authorities\' consistent and 
resolute policy which helped overcome this obstacle.\" 
 
REACTIONS IN THE MEDIA 
 
SWAN SONG OF THE AJARIAN LION 
 
3. Government official Armenian language daily 
HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTIUN (05/07) tries to explain the 
recent events in Ajaria as the result of superpower 
interests in the region.  \"The recent events in Ajaria 
obviously demonstrated the interests that superpowers 
have in the region and showed the new allocation of 
power in the South Caucasus.  We can definitely see 
that the superpowers are paying more attention to the 
economic factor rather than to the military in 
protecting their political interests, i.e. they push 
forward their economic interests, by means of which 
they are trying to dictate their rules of the game. 
The recent turmoil around Ajaria can be explained by 
the economic interests of superpowers.  European 
structures, as well as Moscow and Washington, were 
actively involved in the resolution of the conflict. 
In the current situation there might be a question as 
to why these superpowers are so interested in the 
developments in this small autonomous region.  Ajaria\'s 
only treasure, and at the same time misfortune, is the 
port of Batumi, which served as the cause of a serious 
struggle.\"  \"After Abashidze\'s resignation Sahakashvili 
stated that Georgia\'s reunification has started. 
However, it should be noted that as opposed to Ajaria, 
there are many ethnic conflicts in Abkhazia and South 
Osetia, the resolution of which would be rather 
difficult for official Tbilisi.  Coming back to the 
developments in Ajaria, it should be mentioned that the 
peaceful resolution of the crisis directly affects 
Armenia\'s interests.  For Armenia, the thing of utmost 
importance is the reopening of Ajaria\'s railroad, which 
now will become a priority in the agenda of official 
Tbilisi.\" 
 
THE SUNSET OF THE ABSHIDZE FAMILY 
 
4. Centrist Armenian language daily AZG (05/07) 
outlined the role of Russia in the settlement of the 
conflict and future plans of Sahakashvili.  \"As of May 
6 the `tsar\' of Ajaria is Sahakashvili.  Igor Ivanov, 
the secretary of the Russian Security Council, arrived 
in Batumi at night and took Abashidze and his family 
members to Moscow with him.  What happened in Tbilisi 
on November 22, 2003 was repeated in Batumi.  Both 
Shevarnadze and Aslan Abashidze left the political 
arena under the pressure of the people without any 
blood and fire.  In both cases the mediator was the 
emissary of the Kremlin, Igor Ivanov, who is Georgian 
on his mother\'s side. In a recent interview given to 
Azg, Sahakashvili said that, as during the days of the 
rose revolution Ivanov came to rescue Shevarnadze, on 
the 6th of May he came to Batumi at the invitation of 
Sahakashvili to rescue Abashidze and prevent war 
between Georgia and Ajaria.  Sahakashvili promised the 
people of Batumi that Ajaria is the beginning of the 
reconsolidation [of Georgia]; next it will be 
Abkhazia\'s and South Ossetia\'s turn. However, today 
does not seem to be the time for settling the Abkhazian 
conflict.  First of all the Georgian authorities should 
establish order in Ajaria, by distributing posts 
previously occupied by members of the Abashidze family 
clan among Sahakashvili\'s supporters.\" 
 
LION\'S SONG 
 
5. Oppositionist Armenian daily ARAVOT (05/07) wrote: 
\"After the first unsuccessful collision between newly- 
elected Mikhail Sahakashvili and Ajarian feudal lord 
Abashidze, Russian media was filled with derisive and 
sometimes mocking publications.  In those publications 
Sahakashvili was presented as a failed and hot-tempered 
young man who was feverishly trying to dethrone the 
`experienced\' and `serious\' figure.  Some Armenian mass 
media as well put forth all possible efforts to mock 
the newly elected Sahakashvili, who came to power on a 
wave of public emotion and who had the open support of 
the West.  But recently the irony has abruptly 
lessened. Maybe people here have started to understand 
that it is indecent to defend the local lord, who 
opposes all the existing laws and the constitution of 
the country, who is fully corrupted and who thinks only 
about the self-interest of his clan, and from the other 
side to mock somebody who is the favorite of the 
people.  Following Abashidze\'s loss of Moscow\'s 
support, the Ajarians, who are almost the same as 
Georgians, didn\'t resist even one hour during the 
second collision with Sahakashvili.  Again the people 
won in Georgia and that victory is more than precious 
as it fully reflects the idea of legitimacy of the 
authorities [i.e., elected to power by the will of the 
people].\" 
 
ASLAN HAS ESCAPED 
 
6. Oppositionist Armenian daily HAYKAKAN ZHAMANAK 
(05/07) expressed admiration for the Georgian President 
and thinly veiled disappointment with the current 
leader of Armenia.  \"Georgian President Mikhail 
Sahakashvili once again won the day\'s major political 
battle and achieved Abashidze\'s resignation and escape 
from Georgia.  Especially after the escape of the 
Ajarian `Lion,\' political analysts began to take more 
seriously the promise by Sahakashvili to restore 
regional integrity.  Yes, Sahakashvili won the 
principal battle.  But it happened not because the 
Georgian president is a warrior or the only man in 
Georgia.  It happened because the Georgian people 
believe in their leader, it happened because the 
Georgian people and authorities are a single entity and 
the authorities arose from the people.  And all the 
Georgian people, the whole nation of Georgia won.  It 
goes without saying that Abashidze\'s resignation is not 
considered an intra-Georgian event only.  The already- 
existing great international authority [influence, 
reputation] of Sahakashvili will grow, and it is 
evident that he will start to be accepted as a leader 
of the South Caucasus by the international community 
and his opinion will be of great importance in dealing 
with South Caucasus issues.  Of course we should be 
glad for the success of our neighbors but we should not 
forget about our problems.  But in this case Armenia 
faces another problem.  Robert Kocharian will always 
remain in the shadow of Sahakashvili.  So, Armenia has 
the task of finding a leader like Mikhail 
Sahakashvili.\"

SUBJECT: \"CELEBRATION\" OF WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY IN 
ARMENIA 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: Competing media organizations sponsored 
several events on Monday, May 3, in observance of World 
Press Freedom Day.  Generally critical of the 
government of Armenia, the events also revealed a 
certain amount of intramural hard feelings in the world 
of Armenian journalism.  The U.S. Embassy contribution 
stressed a free press as a cornerstone of democracy and 
continued U.S. support for the development of a free 
press in Armenia. END SUMMARY 
 
YEREVAN PRESS CLUB-LED ROUNDTABLE 
 
2. \"Partnership for Open Society,\" a coalition of media 
organizations and NGOs that support a free press in 
Armenia, sponsored a noon-time roundtable featuring 
Boris Navasardyan, president of the Yerevan Press Club, 
as master of ceremonies.  Other panelists included the 
DCM, whose remarks stressed traditional U.S. support 
for freedom of the press and continued engagement in 
the development of a free press in Armenia. 
 
3. Other speakers on the panel took a much more 
critical stance.  The German ambassador, stating that 
he represented the European Union (as Ireland, 
currently the president of the EU, does not have an 
embassy in Armenia), pointed out that the GOAM had 
undertaken certain commitments on becoming a member of 
the Council of Europe, and that recent government 
actions had called into doubt whether the GOAM was 
capable of living up to those commitments.  The UN 
Department of Public Information representative read 
the message of the Secretary General of the UN, while 
the UNDP representative strongly criticized the GOAM 
for going backwards on press freedom in recent months. 
The chairwoman of the Armenian parliament\'s Standing 
Committee on Science, Education, Culture and Youth 
Issues, Hranoush Hakobian, read a slightly exculpatory 
statement arguing that cooperation between the 
legislature and the media resulted in the new law \"On 
Mass Communication.\"  The Country Manager of the World 
Bank Armenia Office\'s statement at times appeared to 
criticize the GOAM, but tended to veer into self- 
criticism for not more effectively publicizing World 
Bank programs in Armenia. 
 
4. The chairwoman of the Union of Journalists of 
Armenia (UJA) concluded the panel by reading out a bill 
of particulars against the GOAM, calling on the Freedom 
House 2003 report for further evidence that the 
Armenian media is not free.  The UJA statement 
criticized the government for criminalizing libel, 
refusing to provide a broadcast license to the 
television station A1+, not preventing or investigating 
attacks on journalists, and for police attacks against 
journalists in the course of recent demonstrations. 
 
RALLY IN SUPPORT OF A1+ 
 
5. Also on May 3, about 150 people participated in a 
rally and demonstration in support of A1+, marching 
from the House of Press to Charles Aznavour Square. 
The journalists repeated their demands that the GOAM 
hold broadcasting licensing competitions for the as-yet- 
unassigned television frequencies, and to include 
representatives of public organizations on the board 
that evaluates the bids. 
 
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB EVENT 
 
6. Later in the day, the National Press Club held its 
own World Press Freedom Day event which featured an 
\"Enemy of the Press\" award ceremony.  \"Winners\" 
included President Robert Kocharian, who was named an 
Enemy of the Press for the third year in a row; this 
year Kocharian was cited for signing the law \"On Mass 
Communication\" and for failing to pursue cases against 
those who commit violence against journalists. 
Hranoush Hakobian (see paragraph 3 above) was also 
named as an Enemy of the Press for passage of the law 
\"On Mass Communication.\"  (COMMENT: The president of 
the National Press Club had her own draft of the law, 
which was actually more restrictive than the final 
result.  However, she appears to have decided that 
anyone who worked on or supported the law as it now 
stands is opposed to a free press - see especially the 
next nominee.  END COMMENT) Boris Navasardyan, 
president of the Yerevan Press Club, also earned a 
nomination for an Enemy of the Press award (for his 
work on the current law \"On Mass Communication\"), but 
didn\'t garner enough votes to be declared an enemy. 
Interestingly, although there were a number of 
nominations for Friend of the Press, no one received 
enough votes to win that designation. 
 
7. The participants also criticized the GOAM in line 
with the Yerevan Press Club roundtable above, and 
issued their own statement in support of television 
station A1+. 
 
8. COMMENT.  It is generally recognized that the GOAM 
has significant control over the political news 
broadcast on television, either through direct 
ownership (national public TV), ownership of stations 
by friends of the current administration, or by self- 
censorship among the rest of the broadcasters (taking 
their lesson from what happened to A1+ and Noyan Tapan 
TV stations).  The print media, on the other hand, 
expresses a wide variety of opinions, but is weak (most 
newspapers are not commercially viable and require 
support from a \"backer\"), highly politicized 
(reflecting the views of the \"backers\"), and not very 
available outside of Yerevan.  Armenian media figures 
certainly have reason to call for greater freedom of 
the press in Armenia, and took advantage of the 
observance of World Press Freedom Day to speak out. 
One can only hope that their message will be taken 
seriously, by the government and the media alike.  END 
COMMENT.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Negotiations between Armenia\'s governing 
coalition and its political opponents have brought a 
temporary lull to their month-long political 
confrontation.  Talks between leaders of the three pro- 
Kocharian parties that make up coalition government and 
the Justice bloc together with the National Unity Party 
(NUP) resumed on May 6 and will continue through May 14 
at the National Assembly.  Although thus far the has 
dialogue yielded no agreement to compromise, both sides 
are keen to demonstrate that they are heeding the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) 
recommendation urging the government and the opposition 
to embark on a \"dialogue without precondition.\"  The 
sides, nevertheless, agreed to upgrade the status of 
their ongoing \"consultations\" to \"negotiations,\" and to 
finalize their agenda.  Both the president and prime 
minister welcomed the resumption of negotiations and 
but noted they would not participate in the talks 
personally.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEK 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Talks between Armenia\'s governing coalition 
and leaders of the Justice bloc and NUP began on May 6 
and continued throughout the week.  Negotiations took 
place against the backdrop of a 10-day time-out imposed 
by the opposition on anti-Kocharian rallies in order to 
give government time to ease its crackdown on protest 
participants and opposition supporters.  On May 12 the 
three political parties represented in the cabinet 
suggested negotiations to be held over four main issues 
including amendments to the constitution and electoral 
code, joint anti-corruption efforts and the 
implementation of the recent resolution on Armenia of 
the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 
(PACE). 
 
4. (SBU) The coalition also agreed to include the 
opposition\'s issue on \"ways to overcome political 
crisis in Armenia resulting from 2003 elections\" on the 
agenda if the word \"crisis\" were replaced by 
\"situation.\"  The official \"negotiations\" between the 
two sides began May 13 but were cut off almost 
immediately.  Both sides remain keen to show that they 
are following the recommendations for Armenia made by 
PACE on April 28 that urges the government and 
opposition to embark on a \"dialogue without 
preconditions.\"  Both president Kocharian and Prime 
Minister Margarian endorsed a continuation of dialogue 
aimed at defusing political tension, but added that 
they would not participate personally in such talks. 
(Note:  According to reliable press reports, however, 
Margarian met privately with opposition leader and 
former PM Aram Sargsyan early in the week.  End Note.) 
 
------------------------------ 
COMMENT:  STILL SOME WAY TO GO 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) The opposition has already announced they 
would resume their rallies in Yerevan on May 14 (after 
a regional rally in Vanatzor fizzled earlier in the 
week with a turnout of no more than 200) and that they 
will continue to push for Kocharian\'s resignation 
regardless of the outcome of the talks, making it 
unlikely that the current dialogue will yield any 
immediate agreements.  With the two rival camps 
posturing for the press and remaining divided on the 
opposition\'s key issue, Kocharian\'s legitimacy, we 
expect to see only modest movement on some of the other 
outstanding issues over the next several weeks.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Office of the Procurator General (PG) 
announced May 12 that they had identified and 
officially charged two men for attacking journalists 
during an opposition rally on April 5.  An assaulted 
journalist had identified one of them as the man who 
stole her camera and knocked her to the ground.  The 
two men will likely be charged with \"hooliganism,\" a 
charge that can carry up to five years of prison.  The 
opposition press has called on the authorities to 
identify those who ordered these two to disrupt the 
April 5 rally.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
EGGS, FIRECRACKERS, AND BROKEN CAMERAS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The PG\'s office announced May 12 that they 
have detained two unemployed men, Ashot Avetisian and 
Hrair Harityunian, for allegedly attacking journalists 
during the April 5 opposition rally held by the 
National Unity Party in Yerevan.  The rally was 
disrupted when roughly two dozen men started to throw 
eggs at party leader Artashes Geghamian and then set 
off firecrackers.  Photo and TV journalists who filmed 
the disruption had their cameras smashed by a group of 
\"well-built thugs\" with shaven heads.  The incident was 
widely covered by TV and print media; several TV 
channels and opposition newspapers carried some of the 
disrupters\' photos for few days. 
 
----------------------- 
INITIAL POLICE INACTION 
----------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) According to eyewitness accounts the police, 
led by Deputy Police Chief Hovhannes Varian, stayed 
idle and simply watched the whole scene unfold.  Some 
reporters and politicians speculated that the attackers 
were bodyguards of Armenian oligarchs, fueling wide- 
spread rumors that the incident may have been 
orchestrated by the authorities.  (Note:  A slightly 
different, but equally plausible version, was provided 
by a senior GOAM official to us informally.  He claimed 
that one press photographer started snapping pictures 
of the private goons on stand-by at the edge of the 
crowd.  One of them took umbrage and seized camera and 
photographer.  Attracted by the commotion, other 
photographers moved in to cover the scene, and the 
other goons joined their colleagues in destroying the 
film and cameras -- with attendant personal violence. 
Our source did not know the goons\' affiliation, but 
seemed convinced they belonged to one or more prominent 
oligarchs.  In this version, there was no direct 
connection between the egg-throwers and those who 
attacked the journalists.  End Note.) 
 
---------------------- 
COMMENT:  IT\'S A START 
---------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Thus far the PG\'s office has detained two 
alleged perpetrators; according to the PG\'s statement, 
the suspects have already been interrogated and 
confessed.  Aravot daily correspondent Anna Israelian 
recognized one of the suspects, Hrair Harutyunian, as 
the man who stole her camera and knocked her to the 
ground.  The PG\'s office announced that the two 
suspects will be charged with \"hooliganism,\" a Criminal 
Code Article that carries up to five years of 
imprisonment.  The opposition press, meanwhile, is 
calling on the authorities to identify those who 
ordered Avetisian and Harityunian to disrupt the rally. 
Human rights activists and opposition supporters will 
be watching this case closely to judge how committed 
the government is to pursuing those responsible for the 
April 5 events.

2. (SBU) Post nominates the program \"Police and 
Regional Prison Monitoring\" for the Human Rights and 
Democracy Fund, FY04.  This program capitalizes on a 
stated GOAM willingness to allow monitoring of 
detention facilities, expands an existing prison 
monitoring program, and proposes a system of public 
oversight of police actions.  The program builds on 
local and regional initiatives and furthers the 
mission\'s commitment to empowering Armenian citizens 
within the framework of democracy.  The total cost of 
the program is USD 7,800.  The program would last 8 
months but is very likely to provide sustained benefits 
to Armenian monitoring efforts.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
CURRENT MONITORING DIFFICULTIES 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Citizen observers have obtained more access to 
prisons since the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) began 
administering the Armenian prison system in 2002, and 
local human rights NGOs have taken advantage of this 
opening.  In 2003 eleven Armenian NGOs created the 
Civil Society Monitoring Board (CSMB) in cooperation 
with the MOJ.  One member of each participating NGO 
sits on the Board.  This group has relatively free 
access to prisons in Armenia, and will make its first 
annual report to the MOJ and the local news media later 
in 2004.  This group, however, is limited in three 
ways:  their activities outside the capital are 
sporadic because transportation is expensive for local 
NGOs; their numbers are small (only eleven monitors 
have been trained); and they have no access to police 
facilities. 
 
4. (SBU) The leadership of the National Police (NP) has 
been unwilling to allow monitors into police 
facilities.  Even though a 2002 law requires the NDP 
and the MOJ to open their respective facilities to 
public inspection, police facilities have remained 
closed to observers.  NGOs believe that Armenian police 
abuse detainees, but citizens are currently unable to 
measure the extent of this abuse. 
 
--------------------------- 
TRAINING COULD FILL THE GAP 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Post nominates \"Police and Regional Prison 
Monitoring\" for the Human Rights and Democracy Fund 
FY04.  The local Helsinki Committee, which is loosely 
affiliated with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, would 
monitor the grant, create a framework for effective 
monitoring of prisons in regional areas, and establish 
a program to visit police facilities.  In the long 
term, the program plans to create an oversight 
institution with the power to observe and prevent the 
inhumane treatment of Armenians in detention. 
 
6. (SBU) The program would last for 8 months and cost 
USD 7,800.  In the first month, the CSMB would identify 
regional partners and train them in prison and police 
facility monitoring.  Planning and training would be 
followed by four months of prison monitoring in the 
regions.  During this period, the CSMB would also 
approach the NP to secure an agreement on monitoring 
police facilities.  The CSMB currently observes prisons 
around Yerevan, but regional observations would 
intensify under this program.  This experience would 
give the CSMB a track record of success with which to 
approach the NP.  The program would use the remaining 
three months to train additional observers to observe 
police facilities.  After completion of the program, 
the CSMB would write reports on the treatment of 
detainees in prison and police custody, in compliance 
with deadlines negotiated with the MOJ and the NP. 
Both would be independent, public reports.  If the NP 
had not yet agreed to inspections, a plan of next steps 
could be substituted for that report. 
 
7. (U) The cost of the program would be as follows: 
Coordinator             8 months X USD 100     800 
Data Analyst and writer 8 months X USD 100     800 
Computer                                       800 
Training materials/stationery                1,200 
Transportation for training and observation  2,000 
Total cost:                              USD 5,400 
 
8. (SBU) The local NGOs affiliated with CSMB would 
provide trainers, observers, and office space.  The 
Norwegian Helsinki Committee and the OSCE currently 
provide additional expert advice and training 
assistance to the CSMB.  Both agencies have signaled 
their willingness to provide additional training 
support during the period of this program. 
 
----------------- 
PROVEN AND UNIQUE 
----------------- 
 
9. (SBU) The OSCE is familiar with a similar program in 
neighboring Georgia.  The local OSCE encouraged 
Armenian NGOs to form the Civil Society Monitoring 
Board in an attempt to emulate the Georgian model. 
Like the Georgian program, the Civil Society Monitoring 
Board trains individuals to monitor prisons, arranges 
access with the MOJ, and collects its findings in an 
annual report.  This proposed program, however, is a 
first for Armenia.  It plans to examine the treatment 
of detainees nation wide and seeks to create a model 
for monitoring police facilities. 
 
---------------- 
TOWARDS DEMOCRACY 
---------------- 
 
10. (SBU) With widespread allegations of police 
brutality in the penal system, this project is needed 
now.  By expanding prison monitoring and initiating 
monitoring of police detention facilities, this project 
has the potential to gather key information for further 
discussion and would serve as a deterrent to inhumane 
treatment.  Most importantly, it would serve as an 
example of how citizens can work to monitor and check 
government power. 
 
11. (SBU) This program fits firmly within critical 
mission Human Rights priorities.  Embassy Yerevan has 
identified key Mission goals, working to create 
\"sustainable democratic institutions\" and to 
\"empowering citizens to hold government accountable.\" 
CSMB is creating a transparent system of on-going 
observation.  The proposed program would consolidate 
and extend current gains. 
 
12. (SBU) The effects of \"Police and Regional Prison 
Monitoring\" are fully sustainable.  The program trains 
individuals, creates a model, and gives a small amount 
of equipment to a group that has shown its ability to 
sustain a prison monitoring system.  The program would 
create additional human and material resources the 
group can use to bolster further efforts. 
 
13. (SBU) Embassy personnel would evaluate the efficacy 
of the program based on five criteria:  the number of 
regions covered, the number of volunteers trained, the 
completion of a monitoring agreement with the MIA, the 
number of police detention facilities visited, and the 
quality of the public reports produced.  Poloff Peter 
Covington would be the Embassy Action Officer, with 
Aaron Sherinian as back-up.  Post has one State officer 
with grant signing authority, who would be present at 
Post through the completion of the project, in addition 
to USAID grant authorizing officers.  The State 
officer\'s authority is limited to USD 100,000. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
14. (SBU) \"Police and Regional Prison Monitoring\" is 
extremely timely for Armenia.  Recent administrative 
detentions have shown the need for adequate monitoring 
of police activities and citizen oversight.  In 
addition, we support creating a public, non- 
governmental oversight board.  Many governments in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States lack citizen 
oversight boards, and this lack of citizen oversight 
hinders the growth of genuine democracy in these 
nations.  \"Police and Regional Prison Monitoring\" 
should be funded on its own merits and for the example 
it sets in a region of developing democracies.

SUBJECT:  SPRING 2004 DIASPORA ROUNDTABLE FOCUSES ON 
INVESTMENT, PARTNERSHIP WITH USG ASSISTANCE 
 
1. The May 5-7 meetings of the Ambassador\'s Diaspora 
Roundtable held in Yerevan focused on encouraging 
private investment in Armenia and increasing 
partnership between Diaspora-based groups and the USG 
with ongoing assistance projects.  Thirty-seven 
prominent Armenian-Americans representing the entire 
range of Diasporan organizations attended the event. 
The schedule included:  a briefing with the Assistance 
Coordination Group; panel discussions with locally- 
based Diasporans active in the business sector; visits 
to USG assistance program sites in and around the 
capital; a keynote address by President Kocharian\'s 
Chief Economic Advisor Vahram Nercissiantz; a workshop 
with key international donor organizations active in 
Armenia including the World Bank and United Nations; 
and a reception including more than 100 USG 
implementing partners and GOAM representatives. 
Diasporans were also matched with USG employees 
managing programs in specific sectors for specialized 
consultations to explore future possibilities for 
public-private partnerships. 
 
2. Most notable among the meeting\'s conclusions was a 
call by participants for greater transparency and new 
legislation to protect philanthropic efforts by 
Diasporans in Armenia.  The group raised these concerns 
with high-level GOAM representatives and requested 
Embassy support in furthering future dialogue on the 
subject.  The meeting also laid the groundwork for 
initiating or deepening a number of public-private 
partnerships that will complement ongoing USG 
assistance projects in Armenia.  Participants also 
expressed interest in several burgeoning sectors that 
included USG small and medium-sized development 
projects where private investment could strengthen both 
the local economy and Diasporan investment portfolios. 
 
3. The Spring 2004 installment of the Ambassador\'s 
Diaspora Roundtable was the third time the group had 
met since 2002.  Previous meetings were held in Yerevan 
and in Chicago.  The event was conceived as a mechanism 
for greater understanding regarding USG assistance 
efforts in Armenia between leading Diasporan advocacy 
groups and the USG.  Improved communication with the 
Diaspora has stemmed the spread of potentially damaging 
misinformation regarding USG assistance funding in 
Armenia.  In addition, this dialogue has helped direct 
Diasporan assistance efforts to areas complementary to 
USG policy goals of democratic strengthening, economic 
freedom and regional stability.  Armenian-American 
groups have praised the event as the best source for 
direct dialogue with the USG on assistance-related 
issues and called on post to continue this initiative 
in the future.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenian police rounded up and questioned more 
than 25 opposition activists around the country on the 
eve of the planned May 21 opposition rally in Yerevan. 
According to opposition sources and media reports, some 
of them were sentenced to administrative detention 
varying from three to ten days of imprisonment.  Most 
of the detainees were charged with \"insulting 
authorities\" and the \"use of foul language.\"  Court 
verdicts were delivered late in the morning May 20, 
during closed hearings and in the absence of legal 
counsel.  Some of the press reports call recent 
detentions \"preventive\" and explain them by the fact 
that a Collective Security Treaty reception attended by 
visiting CIS ministers and military brass is scheduled 
for the vicinity of the planned opposition rally.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
OPPOSITION ACTIVISTS DETAINED, \"SENTENCES\" PRE-COOKED 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenian police rounded up and questioned more 
that 25 opposition activists around the country May 20 
ahead of the May 21 opposition rally in Yerevan.  Most 
of detained activists are from the People\'s Party of 
Armenia and the Republic Party.  The police appear to 
have been especially zealous in the cities of 
Charentsavan, Artashat and Echmiadzin; the press and 
opposition sources describe the police ambushing 
opposition activists near their homes.  A Republic 
Party representative told us that one of his own police 
contacts admitted they had received lists of people to 
be detained in advance.  The police contact also said 
that some policemen are telling the detainees that they 
have \"an order from above\" to keep people in detention 
for at least three days and urging the opposition 
activists to be \"reasonable.\" 
 
4. (SBU) Some of the opposition activists were fined 
and released in the morning; more than a dozen, 
however, were sentenced to from three to ten days of 
imprisonment under the Soviet-era Code of 
Administrative detention on a vague charge of \"use of 
foul language.\"  A well-known lawyer and chairman of 
International Union of Armenian Lawyers Tigran Ter- 
Yesayan informed the press that the Union formed a 
special \"rapid response\" group of defense counsels to 
provide legal advice to the detainees.   According to 
Ter-Yesayan, in most cases, however, defense counsel 
were unable to see their clients because by the time 
they arrived at prison the court hearings were already 
finished.  Ter-Yesayan alleged that some court hearings 
were held in jails -- and referred to that as an 
obvious violation of the law. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
MAY 21 RALLY AND CIS MINISTERS--SAME TIME, SAME PLACE 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
5. (SBU) Although the opposition press is speculating 
that the recent police crackdown on the planned 
opposition May 21 rally could end in another march to 
Kocharian\'s office, leaders of the Republic Party told 
us that the May 21 rally will not be followed by a 
march because opposition leaders Stepan Demirchian and 
Artashes Geghamian strongly oppose the idea.  A GOAM 
reception for the annual meeting of CIS defense 
ministers in Yerevan is scheduled for the same time in 
the vicinity of the rally, at the Government Guest 
House.  Russian Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov arrived 
in Yerevan on Thursday to hold talks with Armenian 
leaders and attend the annual meeting, and the GOAM is 
clearly unwilling to risk being embarrassed by an 
opposition rally right in front of their CIS 
colleagues. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
COMMENT:  PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS A MAJOR STEP BACKWARD 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6. (SBU) We had been encouraged by ongoing discussions 
between the opposition and governing coalition within 
the National Assembly and by the calm atmosphere both 
during and following recent opposition rallies; the 
current wave of preventive detentions, however, is 
clearly a major step backward and a profound misuse of 
police authority.  We anticipate that this government 
move will close any opportunities for political 
dialogue in the short term.

DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) On May 4, we presented talking points per reftel 
regarding the U.S. Senate approval of the US-IAEA Additional 
protocol.  Ashot Martirosyan, Head of the Armenian Nuclear 
Regulatory Agency (ANRA) officially received the demarche. 
Martirosyan acknowledged the U.S. Senate approval and stated 
that the Armenian Parliament was scheduled to ratify the 
IAEA additional protocol in June or July of 2004. 
 
---------------------- 
CURRENT STATUS OF ANRA 
---------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Martirosyan told us that the ANRA was down to 16 
employees, explaining that this was due to low salaries, 
(about USD 100 to 150), Armenian language requirements, and 
restrictive Armenian civil service hiring procedures. 
Martirosyan told us that the lack of adequate staff would 
make it difficult for ANRA to effectively oversee the 
Armenian Nuclear Power Plant and properly catalogue and 
license all of the radioactive sources in Armenia. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4. (SBU) It is obvious that ANRA as a regulatory body will 
have serious difficulties in the near future regulating the 
nuclear power plant and the several hundred other 
radioactive sources in Armenia.  ANRA will also likely 
continue to lose specialists due to the low salaries and 
fail to attract new ones because of bureaucratic hiring 
difficulties.

PROGRESS IN RECENT YEARS 
------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) Over the past 12 years since independence 
Armenia has moved from a state of open conflict with 
one of its neighbors to a stable, if occasionally 
uneasy, truce, has gone from a deep economic and 
humanitarian crisis to a fast-growing economy with 
the benefits of economic growth beginning to extend 
to the population at large and has seen the first 
flush of patriotic euphoria fade as the country 
works to build an independent and democratic 
society.  Over the course of your brief visit you 
will be meeting with government leaders and 
political activists from across the political 
spectrum, with representatives from the NGO 
community and with local businessmen.  While you are 
here, you will have an opportunity to appreciate the 
consultative approach Armenia pursued developing its 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, see examples of 
the considerable progress that Armenia has made in 
recent years and understand the significant 
challenges still facing Armenia in its transition. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
FLAWED ELECTIONS SET THE STAGE FOR UNREST 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) While Armenia\'s flawed 2003 presidential 
elections have laid the groundwork for the current 
political discord, we believe that there is little 
doubt that President Kocharian did indeed win the 
election, if not by the official margin. 
Nonetheless, the opposition has focused on the 
flawed elections and still low (although improving) 
standard of living to rally moderate numbers of 
protesters to call for Kocharian\'s resignation. 
With no coherent program or charismatic figure, 
however, the opposition has been unable to transform 
a generalized sense of dissatisfaction with the 
status quo into any sort of \"revolutionary fervor\" - 
- and attendance at opposition rallies has been 
dropping steadily over the past five weeks.  The 
opposition has shown neither the desire nor the 
capacity to engage in serious political work to 
affect the course of the country and its future. 
Electoral reforms and Council of Europe-required 
constitutional reform are areas where an engaged 
opposition could have a significant impact.  For its 
part, the government has moderated its responses to 
the rallies from the excesses and nearly 200 
administrative detentions following the April 12 
rally and march.  It has not yet demonstrated, 
however, it is willing to back away from 
administrative measures to intimidate the 
opposition.  As a result, there is little prospect 
of any meaningful political dialogue or interaction. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
PRESIDENT KOCHARIAN--FIRMLY IN CONTROL 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) President Robert Kocharian is deeply 
engaged in the Millennium Challenge process.  An 
avid reader, he speaks fairly good English, although 
he will likely use an interpreter for at least part 
of your meeting with him.  You will find him a well- 
informed interlocutor with strong opinions. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
PRIME MINISTER--CEREMONIAL HEAD OF THE BOARD 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) You will be meeting with Prime Minister 
Andranik Margaryan, who the GOAM has identified as 
the likely ceremonial head of the board of directors 
charged with responsibility for oversight of any 
eventual MCA compact proposal.  Margaryan, the 
longest sitting Prime Minister in Armenia\'s post- 
Soviet history, played a major role in forming the 
current governing coalition in the Armenian 
parliament.  Margaryan points to recent strong 
economic growth as the result of reforms he 
sponsored since taking on responsibilities as Prime 
Minister in 2000.  He is generally respected by 
colleagues as a pleasant and effective leader who 
enjoys good relationships across party lines.  A 
slow but deliberate interlocutor, Margaryan 
considers himself a \"simple man,\" whose background 
and views on life are representative of the Armenian 
population as a whole.  An engineer by background, 
53-year-old Margaryan was jailed by Soviet 
authorities for a short period in the mid-1970s. 
---------------------------------------- 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY--A WHIFF OF MODERATION 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) During the recent political events the 
National Assembly, under the leadership of its 
Speaker, Artur Baghdasarian, has played a mediating 
role between the government and the opposition. 
Although the vast majority of the National Assembly 
and all of its leadership are members of the 
governing coalition, the speaker and his closest 
advisors have worked to carve out a modest space for 
political discourse.  The extent to which the 
governing coalition can bring the opposition into 
the political process will be crucial:  successful 
constitutional reform (a part of Armenia\'s on-going 
Council of Europe commitments) and electoral law 
reform will only be possible if politicians from 
across the political spectrum participate actively.

2. (SBU) Post applauds UNICEF\'s efforts in partnering 
with many agencies in Armenia to improve the capacity 
of government agencies working with socially 
disadvantaged children, and to advocate on behalf of 
these same children.  Per reftel request, Post notes 
that UNICEF\'s Armenia programs complement USG economic 
development programs.  End Summary. 
 
-------------- 
ROLE OF UNICEF 
-------------- 
 
3. (SBU) UNICEF continues to play a vital role in 
advocacy and capacity development in Armenia.  The 
agency has identified some significant problems in 
Armenia including:  inadequate food intake, pervasive 
child neglect, a lack of micronutrients in the average 
diet, and insufficient health care.  Along with their 
partners, UNICEF attempts to address these needs. 
UNICEF programs complement USG programs.  While USG 
resources currently focus on overall economic and 
democratic development, UNICEF focuses specifically on 
the critical needs of socially disadvantaged children 
and their families.  Post would encourage UNICEF to 
more tightly focus some of its goal statements in the 
\"Draft Country Programme Document\" to help it better 
measure improvement in the well being of children, but 
overall assesses its work in Armenia positively. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
DESPITE IMPRESSIVE GROWTH, POVERTY REMAINS AN ISSUE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4. (SBU) Armenia has experienced impressive growth in 
real incomes, but poverty is still high, especially in 
rural areas.  Almost 50 percent of Armenians live below 
the poverty line.  GOAM health care spending is 
approximately USD 8 per person, and health care 
services, when available, are unaffordable for many 
Armenians.  Government educational spending is less 
than one third of that spent in Armenia during the 
Soviet period.  We believe that UNICEF\'s continuing 
support for maternal and child health programs, as well 
as child protection and welfare programs is vital to 
the implementation and success of Armenia\'s Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).

their league.  Kocharian reacted to Ambassador Pascual\'s call 
on the GOAM to accelerate reforms and stand out as a leader 
among neighboring countries by enumerating a lengthy list of 
GOAM initiatives keyed to Armenia\'s Council of Europe 
obligations.  He pointed to the privatization of major 
industries, recent anti-monopoly legislation, private 
property disclosure laws, civil service reform and efforts to 
de-centralize the power structure of government bureaucracies 
as proof that GOAM was \"well on its way toward Europe.\" 
Kocharian argued that democracy in Armenia was inextricably 
tied to economic opportunity and the possibility of more jobs 
and a better standard of living.  Ambassador Pascual 
responded that increased economic opportunities would come to 
Armenia if the GOAM made the internal changes necessary for 
an image as a fully democratic state. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
SIDES DISCUSS BANKING SECTOR, CORRUPTION 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The meeting included a discussion of issues related to 
reforms in the banking sector, highlighting it as one of the 
most important important economic issues Armenia currently 
faces.  Both sides discussed the conclusions of the May 17-18 
meetings of the U.S.-Armenia Task Force on Economic 
Cooperation (USATF) including the need to increase lending as 
a percentage of GDP and address impediments to lending. 
Ambassador Pascual highlighted the fact that a lack of 
financial intermediation locally would preclude sustainable 
growth and diversification in the Armenian economy.  He 
underlined the need for legislation on collateral rights and 
said that the USG and GOAM would cooperate on these issues 
following the completion of the USAID-sponsored financial 
sector study being coordinated with the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund. 
 
5. (C) In response to Kocharian\'s outline of the GOAM\'s 
recently adopted anti-corruption strategy, Ambassadors Ordway 
and Pascual suggested that the GOAM first take concrete 
actions that would resonate among the Armenian population as 
a whole and lend credibility to the the stategy and signal 
real commitment from the government.  The sides discussed 
possibilities for such initiatives in areas that impact the 
lives of everday citizens, including law enforcement. 
Ambassador Pascual pressed for action in Armenia\'s courts and 
said that corrupt individuals needed to fear a risk of 
imprisonment for corrupt behavior.  Kocharian expressed 
concern regarding this last point, responding that he would 
rather find ways to \"eliminate the roadblocks that cause 
corruption.\"  His comments suggested that he would prefer to 
address the issue systematically rather than crack down on 
corrupt individuals in positions of authority or economic 
influence. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
KOCHARIAN ON MCA:  \"WE\'RE READY TO GO\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Kocharian reacted enthusiastically to news of the 
visit to Armenia of MCC CEO Applegarth and his delegation 
scheduled for early June.  He said that the GOAM was \"ready 
to go\" and was already making preparations for an MCA compact 
submission, including the designation of a local board of 
directors (likely headed by the Prime Minister) and 
sponsoring preliminary discussions among appropriate 
ministries regarding areas of greatest need.  Kocharian said 
he was committed to the need for broad consultation with 
civil society during the process of developing an MCA compact 
submission.  When informed that regression in important areas 
involving democracy and governance could potentially reverse 
a country\'s MCA eligibility, Kocharian stated emphatically 
that the GOAM had actually made progress in terms of 
individual freedoms.  While generally skeptical of the 
organizations or methods used to obtain MCA indicators, 
Kocharian said he was confident that Armenia\'s scores would 
only improve in these areas. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
IMPLEMENTING USATF CONCLUSIONS VAT REFUNDS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7. (C)  During a discussion of conclusions from the recent 
USATF meetings, Kocharian recognized that some U.S. business 
had complained about the need for quicker, more complete VAT 
refunds.  He said, however, that the GOAM was concerned that 
tax fraud, including bogus transfers of VAT refund 
eligibility among businesses, could represent a major drain 
on potential state income.  He thanked the USG for its offer 
to work with the GOAM to address these issues. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (C) Kocharian\'s remarks indicate that he is acutely aware 
of international criticism after the fallout of the mid-April 
opposition rallies in Armenia.  While citing MCA eligibility 
as a positive evaluation of the country, he simultaneously 
expressed somewhat defeatist views of his domestic and 
international reputation at the moment.  His opinion that, 
\"Either way I appear to be guilty,\" however, does not seem to 
have hampered his pro-active approach to the process of 
developing an MCA compact.  He appears to be investing 
political capital and listening carefully to signs from 
Washington regarding MCA so that a full team is in place to 
greet the MCC delegation in early June. 
 
9. (U) Ambassador Pascual has cleared on this message.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) UNDP provides a valuable service to Armenia 
and supports U.S. goals.  UNDP\'s current country 
program and goal statements are based on realistic 
assessments of Armenia\'s needs and reflect a knowledge 
of past programs\' weaknesses and strengths.  Post 
commends UNDP for its efforts in Armenia.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
WEAKNESSES AND STRENGTHS 
------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) Post fully concurs with UNDP\'s self-assessment 
of program strengths and weaknesses as described in the 
country program.  As stated in the UNDP Country Program 
for Armenia, structural factors play a large part in 
poverty and corruption, and these factors were not 
sufficiently taken into consideration in the 2000-2004 
cooperation framework.  In addition, Post verifies that 
the GOAM did not fully implement the intended better- 
governance applications of some UNDP projects. 
 
4. (SBU) The new country program emphasizes building 
partnerships and developing strategies, which focus on 
nationally-identified goals, and Post believes this 
approach will alleviate most of the previous 
programmatic shortcomings.  The country program also 
proposes to revise the management structure of the UNDP 
mission in Armenia.  This restructuring has already 
resulted in increased efficiency, tighter focus of UNDP 
programs, and more accountability. 
 
------------------ 
USG GOALS AND UNDP 
------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) The UN Development Assistance Framework 
(UNDAF) governs the direction of the local UNDP 
mission.  The UNDAF fits well with U.S. interests in 
Armenia, and it focuses on sustainable economic 
development and strengthening democratic institutions, 
which are two of the highest priorities for Post. 
USAID partners with UNDP on approximately 80 percent of 
UNDP\'s current and proposed economic development 
projects.  Both agencies help Armenia implement its 
Poverty Reduction Strategy, both encourage development 
of small- and medium-sized enterprises, and both 
emphasize corporate social responsibility.  UNDP and 
Post conduct different projects to encourage democratic 
institution building, but the projects are 
complementary and encourage transparent institutions, 
which are accountable to the citizens of Armenia. 
 
----------------------- 
SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS 
----------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) As proposed in the country program, UNDP 
effectively supports public/private partnerships to 
encourage corporate social responsibility.  In December 
2003, UNDP and Post officials began a dialogue with ten 
of the most powerful businessmen in Armenia in an 
effort to instill principles of corporate social 
responsibility in Armenian business.  In early March 
2004, UNDP and Post launched a similar effort aimed at 
medium and large Armenian enterprises with the full 
support and participation of GOAM officials.  Post 
believes these partnerships will effectively engage the 
GOAM and business in poverty reduction strategies, and 
they offer an example of improved performance of UNDP 
cooperation, based on its country program and UNDAF. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) UNDP is an extremely effective development 
partner in Armenia.  Under its current management, 
UNDP\'s efforts are effectively targeted and result 
oriented.  Post values its partnership with UNDP.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) On May 19, 2004, Garnik Badalian, Head of the Iran 
desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, briefed us about a 
recent agreement on the Iran - Armenia pipeline.  Badalian 
said that on May 12, 2004, the Iranian Oil Minister signed 
an agreement with the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant to 
exchange Iranian gas for electricity produced from that gas. 
The agreement provides for the exchange of 36 billion cubic 
meters of gas over a period of 20 years, from 2007 to 2027, 
in consideration for 3 kWhs of electricity for each cubic 
meter of gas.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
CONTRACT ENVISAGES SWAP OF GAS FOR ELECTRICITY, NO SALE 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3. (SBU) According to Badalian, the parties signed a 20-year 
agreement providing for the exchange of 36 billion cubic 
meters of gas with an option to extend five years (and 
another 9 million cubic meters of gas).  The contract 
provides for the provision of gas beginning in 2007, and 
that construction should start within the next six months. 
But Badalian believed that due to financing issues and what 
he called the \"Iranian habit\" of delaying projects, actual 
construction would not start for at least 12 months. 
According to public statements by Deputy Minister of Finance 
Areg Galstyan (who has not proved to be a reliable source in 
the past), the contract includes no provisions for the sale 
of gas, but once built the pipeline could be used for gas 
sales from Iran or Turkmenistan. 
 
------------------------ 
NO ONWARD SALE ENVISAGED 
------------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) Badalian explained that the Armenian government 
(GOAM) has scotched the idea of onward sales to Georgia or 
Europe, due to lack of resources and investment.  He said 
that the diameter of the planned pipeline would be about 700 
millimeters, enough to satisfy Armenia\'s domestic gas needs 
but too little to justify building a continuation of the 
line for onward sales to the North.  He added that such a 
pipeline would have to be at least 1000 to 1500 millimeters 
in diameter, and would cost nearly USD 4 million per 
kilometer to build in the hills of southern Armenia.  An 
investment of this size, says Badalian, seems out of the 
question. 
 
----------------------- 
STILL NO MONEY TO BUILD 
----------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Badalian emphasized that financing the pipeline is 
still a big problem and hoped that this could be partly 
solved through international investment.  He explained that 
there was no specific line item in Iran\'s budget for this 
project, but he believed that the Iranian government has 
access to multiple funds that could easily pay for the 
pipeline.  GAOM has still not identified any funds to pay 
for the construction.  (Comment:  We believe that it is 
possible that the GOAM may be able to pay for the pipeline 
construction in Armenia through proceeds from scheduled 
privatizations in 2004, although we have no evidence to 
support this.  End Comment.) 
 
---------------------------- 
MFA CONSIDERS ILSA SANCTIONS 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Badalian raised the issue of the Iran-Libya 
Sanctions Act and American opposition to the pipeline.  He 
emphasized that one hundred thousand Armenian expatriates 
currently live in Iran, and that it would be impossible for 
Armenia not to have relations with Iran.  He noted that the 
pipeline would actually be in the USG\'s interest, as it 
would promote stability in the region.  He explained that 
the pipeline would be insurance against gas supplies being 
cut off by an unstable Georgia or by a fickle Russian 
government.  He added that Iran already sells large 
quantities of gas to Turkey, an ally of the US; he hoped 
there would be no great protests from the USG if a fraction 
of that amount were sold to Armenia. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
COMMENT: HAVEN\'T GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT JUST YET 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
7. (SBU) There are still a lot of problems with the plan 
proposed by GOAM.  While at times it appears that the GOAM 
is unwilling to share its ultimate plan for the pipeline, we 
believe it is more likely that they just haven\'t figured out 
exactly how to go forward.  According to technical data 
obtained from PA Consulting, the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant 
(YTPP) is unable to translate 1.5 billion cubic meters of 
gas into 171 megawatts of electricity due to its poor 
condition and the inability to transmit the 171 megawatts 
over its existing transmission system to Iran while meeting 
other user requirements.  The GOAM plan to construct a new, 
more efficient gas fired plant at YTPP by 2009 could help 
solve this by producing the agreed kWh for Iran with 20 to 
30 percent less gas, permitting the GOAM to use or sell that 
volume of gas for other purposes. 
 
8. (SBU) From the GOAM perspective, the pipeline could be 
profitable if the new gas plant was constructed on time or 
if nuclear or hydro production was above average.  From the 
Iranian perspective, if Armenia uses the gas for other 
purposes, Iran could receive cash payments as opposed to 
electricity.  Iran also may believe that with this pipeline, 
they could have access to Armenian, Georgian and even 
Russian markets and reduce its isolation in the 
international community.  Regardless of the uncertain 
economic benefits this gas pipeline would give to both 
countries, it is increasingly clear that this does not 
appear to preclude the political will for the pipeline or, 
ultimately, its realization.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (U) The current National Assembly (NA) marked its 
first anniversary May 26 with a chess tournament 
featuring international grandmaster Smbat Lputyan who 
played against 14 MPs and NA staffers.  Each party 
faction, including the opposition Justice bloc, 
nominated two players for the tournament.  Coalition 
and opposition MPs proudly posed with Lputyan in front 
of the cameras and seemed more than eager to skip 
debates over the few draft laws that were on May 26 
parliamentary agenda.  Eventually NA Speaker 
Baghdasaryan dragged the players and their numerous 
fans into the session hall for a quick 5-minute 
parliamentary vote.  In the end, the grandmaster won 
eleven and played three games to a draw.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
NA ANNIVERSARY MARKED BY CHESS TOURNAMENT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The third convocation of the Armenian National 
Assembly completed its first legislative year on May 
26.  To mark the anniversary, MP Hranush Hakobian, 
chairwoman of the Standing Committee on Culture, 
Education, Youth and Sport, invited international 
grandmaster Smbat Lputyan for a chess tournament with 
legislators and parliamentary staffers.  Each party 
faction nominated two MPs and/or staffers for the game; 
MPs Aram Sargsyan, chairman of Democratic Party, and 
Viktor Dalakyan represented the opposition Justice 
bloc.  (Note:  Although the opposition Justice bloc 
continues to boycott National Assembly sessions, they 
were out in force for the exhibition chess tournament. 
End Note.)  MP Ashot Aghababian, who owns the lucrative 
Hrazdan retail market, donated 30 chessboards to NA for 
the game.  Supporting teams of MPs, visitors, and the 
media had lots of fun while Lputyan simultaneously 
played against his 14 opponents. 
 
4. (U) Both the coalition and opposition chess players 
fully supported each other at the tournament. 
Throughout the game, numerous chess fans commented 
irreverantly on every move on the board, served 
generous amounts of coffee to compensate for, as they 
put it, the \"unusual mental overload\" for MPs, and 
vigilantly prevented one of the players from swiping a 
chess piece as a souvenir.  In his turn, head of the 
governing coalition\'s Republican faction Galust 
Sahakian said in an interview that if the opposition 
won the chess game then they could ask for anything, 
including a vote of confidence. 
 
5. (SBU) Absorbed by the game, coalition MPs were more 
than reluctant to get back to their legislative 
activities and debate a few drafts that were on May 26 
parliamentary agenda.  NA Speaker Baghdasaryan 
literally dragged the coalition MPs into the session 
hall, promising that the vote would take \"only five 
minutes.\"  Meanwhile, opposition MPs Sargsyan and 
Dalakyan used the continuing opposition parliamentary 
boycott to their advantage and kept playing.  In the 
end, however, none of the MPs was able to defeat the 
grandmaster:  out of 14 games, Lputyan won 11 outright 
and played 3 to a draw.

SUBJECT:  DECIPHERING THE ARMENIAN-AMERICAN DIASPORA 
 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The Armenian-American Diaspora continues to wield 
considerable influence upon the foreign and domestic 
policies of the Government of Armenia.  This influence 
ranges from the obvious connection of U.S.-born and/or 
trained GOAM officials, the influence of private and public 
U.S. assistance funding and the more nuanced impact of 
person-to-person relations between the GOAM and the 
Diaspora.  Of the estimated 8-10 million people who consider 
themselves \"Armenians\" who live outside the Republic of 
Armenia, the GOAM and major Armenian cultural and advocacy 
organizations estimate that 1.5-2 million live in the United 
States.  The Armenian Diaspora community in the U.S. can be 
classified along a number of broad categories that involve 
intersecting political and religious affiliations and 
historical considerations.  The two most visible political 
advocacy groups in the Diaspora, the Armenian Assembly of 
America (AAA) and the Armenian National Committee of America 
(ANCA) dominate policy efforts but still constitute a 
minority of the U.S. Diaspora population.  Their membership 
numbers notwithstanding, most policy makers view the agendas 
of the AAA and ANCA as representative of the Armenian- 
American population as a whole. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
DESPITE RUSSIA TALK, U.S. INFLUENCE STILL STRONG 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (SBU) While the debate continues over whose Diaspora - 
Russia\'s or the United States\' - wields greater influence in 
Armenia, it is impossible to underestimate the impact of the 
Armenian-American community on the GOAM.  A number of 
current and former high-level GOAM policymakers were born, 
raised or trained in the United States with long-term 
connections to the Diaspora community in the U.S.  Current 
examples of this connection include Armenia\'s Foreign 
Minister, both Deputy Foreign Ministers, various 
Presidential Advisors including the Chief Advisor on 
Economic Issues, the Minister of Trade and Economic 
Development and a number of deputy ministers in other 
ministries.  These policymakers understand the financial and 
cultural impact of Armenian-American organizations on the 
Republic of Armenia (officially through bilateral lobbying 
and unofficially through cultural exchanges, financial 
remittances and historical connections) and nod to it in 
public and private as the driving force among the various 
Diaspora communities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
COMPARING THE U.S., OTHER DIASPORA POPULATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (SBU) Of the estimated 8-10 million people living outside 
the Republic of Armenia who consider themselves \"Armenians,\" 
the GOAM and major Armenian cultural and advocacy 
organizations estimate that 1.5-2 million live in the United 
States.  This number ranks second after the estimated 2 to 
2.5 million Armenians that live most of the year in Russia 
or other CIS Countries.  After the U.S., some of the largest 
Armenian Diaspora populations live in France, Lebanon, 
Syria, Argentina, Syria and Turkey.  The GOAM distinguishes 
the Armenian-American community from the other Diaspora 
populations as the most wealthy (both overall and per capita 
income) and the most diverse in terms of emigration 
patterns.  GOAM assistance figures and information from 
local banking sources confirm that the majority of Armenia\'s 
public and private assistance funding (including private 
money transfers to families or friends) comes to Armenia 
from the U.S.  The GOAM\'s MFA Diaspora Relations office 
makes no secret of the Armenian-American community\'s deep 
organizational structure as its most important 
distinguishing characteristic. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
DECIPHERING U.S. DIASPORA ORGANIZATIONS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Armenian-American groups boast that the U.S. is 
home to the most organized Armenian Diaspora in the world. 
In terms of numbers of institutions, associations, church 
groups and dedicated media outlets, this assertion is true. 
Roughly fifty Armenian-American organizations claim 
nationwide membership somewhere in the thousands.  These 
organizations tend to maintain a clear leadership structure 
and most engage in regular grassroots activities. 
Naturally, most of these groups\' agendas intersect and many 
Diasporans belong to two or more organizations while many of 
the 1.5 to 2 million claim no affiliation.  Embassy sources 
from the membership departments of the AAA and the Armenian 
General Benevolent Union (AGBU) estimate that over fifty 
percent of Armenian-Americans participate in either an 
Armenian religious or political organization but that only 
twenty to thirty percent consider themselves \"active in 
Armenian political issues.\" 
 
5. (SBU) The Armenian Diaspora community in the U.S. can be 
grouped along seven broad categories that involve 
intersecting political and religious affiliations and 
historical considerations.  While most Armenian-American 
organizations are anxious to promote themselves as having 
broad-based memberships and as unaffiliated with any single 
group, many within the GOAM and high-level representatives 
within the Diaspora share this view of the U.S. Diaspora 
community.  (Note:  As with all demographic overviews, these 
groupings include multiple exceptions and contradictions. 
While this analysis provides a useful tool for deciphering 
the general orientation of organizations, it should not be 
considered absolute.  End note.) 
 
---------------------------- 
THE AGBU, RAMKAVARS, DIOCESE 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Three highly visible Diasporan organizations can be 
broadly linked to the Armenian General Benevolent Union 
(AGBU), the Armenian Democratic League (ADL or \"Ramkavars\") 
and/or affiliation with the Diocese branch of the Armenian 
Church.  The Armenian MFA and Armenian advocacy 
organizations based in the U.S. estimate that this grouping 
captures roughly 30 percent of those active in the Armenian- 
American community.  While often less politically active 
than the two largest advocacy organizations in the Diaspora 
(the AAA and ANCA), the AGBU and its affiliated 
organizations exercise considerable influence upon 
grassroots thinking about Armenia-related issues. 
 
7. (SBU) The AGBU is the largest worldwide charitable 
organization in the Armenian Diaspora and constitutes one of 
the three largest groups of Armenians in the United States 
today.  While the AGBU claims a non-political agenda and 
concentrates its programming on educational or humanitarian 
pursuits worldwide, it also touts itself as the \"mainstay of 
Armenian liberalism\" among Armenian-Americans.  The AGBU is 
the force behind the largest Armenian school program 
worldwide in Diaspora communities.  They currently sponsor 
more than 24 schools in 18 countries.  The AGBU played a 
major role in humanitarian aid to Armenia during the harsh 
economic conditions of 1991-1993 and continues to finance 
high-profile projects in Armenia including the American 
University of Armenia (through a continuing endowment and 
annual support) and the operation of the national opera and 
symphony hall complex in Yerevan. 
 
8. (SBU) The membership of the second largest political 
party based in the Armenian-American Diaspora, the Armenian 
Democratic League (ADL or \"Ramkavars\"), has considerable 
connections with the AGBU.  Historically, the majority of 
AGBU donors and board members were members of or sympathized 
with the Ramkavar Party to some degree.  The Ramkavars 
represent one of the most politically conservative elements 
of the Armenian-American community.  The ADL is still 
loosely associated with the Ramkavar party in the Republic 
of Armenia (which controlled a handful of seats in Armenia\'s 
first parliament in the early twentieth century and after 
independence during the administration of President Levon 
Ter-Petrossian.  The Ramkavars still reportedly wield 
considerable influence upon the editorial content of the 
Armenian daily \"Azg\").  While generally less nationalistic 
than some of their ANCA counterparts in the U.S., the ADL\'s 
political agenda includes a major push for worldwide 
recognition of the events of 1915 as a \"genocide.\"  The ADL 
continues to advocate for USG assistance funding for Armenia 
through political advocacy organizations, most notably the 
AAA. 
 
9. (SBU) The Knights and Daughters of Vartan, a service 
organization whose recent activities are based loosely upon 
models such as the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs, is one of the 
most active Armenian-American fraternal associations based 
in the U.S.  This organization claims membership in the tens 
of thousands and sponsors humanitarian activities in the 
Republic of Armenia including the renovation of schools and 
health facilities in rural communities. 
 
10. (SBU) Organizations affiliated with the AGBU (including 
the ADL and Knights/Daughters of Vartan and others) are 
generally characterized by their affiliation with the 
Diocese of the Armenian Church (\"The Diocese\").  The Diocese 
is the largest branch of the Armenian Church which 
recognizes the Catholicosate of All Armenians (based in 
Etchmiadzin, Armenia) as the apostolic authority of the 
Armenian Church.  Diocese congregations make up the majority 
of Armenian religious groups in the United States.  While it 
would be inappropriate to state that all AGBU or ADL members 
worship as part of a Diocese congregation, there is a 
tendency for these groups to align with one another on 
political issues.  The humanitarian arm of the Diocese, the 
Fund for Armenian Relief (FAR), raises and distributes 
millions of dollars in humanitarian relief aid to the 
Repulic of Armenia each year.  In addition, FAR has won 
contracts to implement international donor community-funded 
projects including the ongoing USG humanitarian programs in 
Nagorno-Karabagh. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
\"INDEPENDENT\" BUT CLOSE TO DIOCESE/AGBU CLUSTER:  AAA 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
11. (SBU) While claiming to be totally \"independent\" from 
the other clusters within the Armenian-American community, 
the Armenian Assembly of America (AAA) most often aligns 
itself with the AGBU/Diocese cluster on political policy 
issues.  The AAA claims to be the largest Armenian-American 
advocacy organization.  The AAA\'s membership is probably the 
most inclusive of Diaspora organizations because it has gone 
to great lengths to involve both the Diocese and Prelacy 
religious communities.  According to Embassy sources, the 
AAA\'s dues-paying membership totals approximately 3,000 in 
the U.S. with 7,000 to 9,000 AAA \"activists\" regularly 
volunteering on AAA grassroots advocacy efforts.  These 
advocacy activities include the AAA\'s annual meetings with 
the U.S. Congress during which the organization lobbies for 
USG Assistance funding and discusses policy issues including 
relations with Turkey and genocide recognition.  While not 
legally registered as a PAC, the AAA\'s efforts resemble 
those of a traditional issue-based lobbying organization but 
also include programmatic endeavors such as the Armenia Tree 
Project, the Yerevan-based NGO Center and other assistance 
programs.  The AAA maintains offices in Washington, D.C., 
Los Angeles and Yerevan. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
MAJOR DIASPORA CLUSTER 2:  DASHNAKS (ARF), ANCA, PRELACY 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
12. (SBU) The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) is a 
worldwide organization that reports affiliates in over 200 
countries including a strong presence in the United States. 
The ARF is widely known by its nickname \"Dashnaksutyun.\" 
The term \"Dashnak\" is often used to refer to members or 
sympathizers of the ARF.  Active since 1890, the 
organization is the most politically oriented of the 
Armenian Diaspora groups around the world and has 
traditionally been one of the most vocal supporters of 
Armenian nationalism.  ARF groups were active in helping 
establish Armenia\'s first republic and as a self-proclaimed 
\"alternative, nationalistic school of thought\" in Armenia 
and the Diaspora during the Soviet era.  The ARF\'s Diaspora 
groups are linked through a direct organizational chain to 
the ARF \"Dashnaksutyun\" party that is active in the Republic 
of Armenia today as a member of the governing coalition. 
This link notwithstanding, the majority of the ARF\'s funding 
and influence has almost always resided within the Diaspora. 
While Diaspora-based groups go to great lengths to defer to 
the ARF\'s Yerevan offices on worldwide policy matters, it is 
clear that ARF affiliates in the U.S., Canada, France and 
Russia have a majority voice in many issues regarding 
policies on issues such as relations with Turkey and Nagorno- 
Karabakh. 
 
13. (SBU) The ARF\'s U.S.-based political advocacy arm is the 
Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA).  ANCA is the 
principal political spokesperson for ARF policies in the 
United States.  ANCA\'s grassroots activities regarding April 
24 commemoration addresses, U.S. policy vis-a-vis Turkey, 
and advocacy of independent status for Nagorno-Karabakh are 
some of its most visible policy campaigns both within the 
Armenian-American community and to outside observers.  In 
addition to more than 100 locally based chapters, ANCA 
manages regional (East and West Coast) offices and a 
national headquarters in Washington, D.C.  ANCA\'s strong 
links with the ARF headquarters in Yerevan have up until now 
obviated the need for an independent office in Armenia. 
 
14. (SBU) Together with its vocal grassroots campaigns on 
political issues, the ARF has created one of the most 
successful networks of cultural and youth organizations 
among Armenian-Americans.  The Armenian Relief Society (ARS) 
is a nationwide women\'s auxiliary association that serves as 
the ARF\'s charitable and educational arm.  The Armenian 
Youth Federation (AYF) coordinates summer camps and 
political education programs for young Armenian-Americans in 
conjunction with worldwide ARF programs. 
15. (SBU) For decades, an unofficial link existed between 
the ARF and the Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church 
(\"The Prelacy\").  The Prelacy recognizes the authority of 
the Armenian Catholicos based in Antelias, Lebanon (often 
referred to as the Cilician See).  The ARF-Prelacy alignment 
coincided with the outbreak of the Cold War.  With Diocese 
leaders based in Soviet Armenia, nationalistic ARF activists 
opted to operate through Prelacy congregations in the United 
States which they felt were less susceptible to Soviet 
influences and could best advance their cause for an 
independent Armenia.  Prelacy congregations are by no means 
exclusively populated by ARF supporters.  The perception 
exists among many, however, that \"Dashnaks worship with the 
Prelacy.\"  While there are fewer adherents of Prelacy 
congregations than Diocese congregations in the United 
States, this group remains a significant and active part of 
the Armenian-American religious community.  (Note:  There 
are no liturgical or theological differences between the two 
branches of the Armenian Apostolic Church.  Relations are 
cordial if not warm.  The current Catholicos\' predecessor 
had been the Catholicos in Antelias before his election in 
Etchmiadzin, and representatives of Antelias participate in 
the election of a new Catholicos in Etchmiadzin.  End note.) 
 
------------------------------------- 
MAKING SENSE OF THE AAA/ANCA \"DIVIDE\" 
------------------------------------- 
 
16. (SBU) The AAA and ANCA are two of the most visible 
Armenian-American political advocacy organizations in the 
United States.  Both organizations maintain Washington, D.C. 
offices and regional hubs in major U.S. cities.  While their 
platforms are not diametrically opposed to one another, 
their different approaches on key topics such as relations 
with Turkey and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict at times give 
the impression to observers both in and outside the Armenian- 
American community that they are competitors.  While the two 
organizations often pool their resources for joint projects 
(including April 24 commemoration initiatives on the Hill, 
lobbying efforts aimed to increase USG assistance funds 
destined for Armenia et al.), the highest levels of their 
respective membership rosters rarely overlap.  ANCA\'s 
grassroots strategy often appears to the public as more 
aggressive and politically charged than the AAA\'s. 
Professional representatives from two groups regularly hold 
informal consultations on key issues, but high-ranking 
representatives agree that significant rifts about where to 
invest political and human capital are commonplace.  (Note: 
While the AAA might at times be critical of ANCA\'s 
methodology, it appears that AAA often benefits from the 
increased awareness or heightened visibility that ANCA\'s 
activities offer the Armenian-American community.  End 
note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
CLUSTER 3 - ORGANIZATIONS CLOSE TO THE \"HNCHAKS\" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
17. (SBU) Activities of the smallest, and yet of the most 
well-known politically based groups of Armenian-American 
organizations centers around the ideology of the Armenian 
Social Democratic Hnchakian (or Hnchak) Party.  Known as 
\"Hnchaks,\" members of these organizations claim to be part 
of the oldest Armenian Diasporan political organization in 
the world.  Founded in 1887, the Hnchak Party originally 
called for an independent, democratic Armenia encompassing 
the historical Armenian territory.  The organization 
flourished among Diaspora communities in the Middle East and 
Europe and established a strong presence on the West Coast 
of the United States.  The party and its affiliate 
organizations in the U.S. (fraternal societies, a women\'s 
advocacy group and various youth groups) played an 
historically conservative role among Armenian-American 
groups during the second half of the twentieth century. 
Following the Armenian independence movement of the late 
1980s, the Hnchak Party re-established itself in Armenia, 
winning seats in Parliament and carving out a small role in 
domestic politics.  Hnchak organizations in the United 
States claimed to wield considerable influence on GOAM 
policies during this period. 
 
18. (SBU) Disputes among party leadership and two subsequent 
splits in the party during the late 1990s weakened the 
party\'s standing in Armenia and consequently the influence 
of Hnchak-related groups in the U.S.  Hnchak party leaders 
tell the Embassy that the party\'s aging membership in the 
United States, coupled with the recent internal disputes, 
have seriously weakened their influence as an arm of the 
Armenian-American lobby.  The memory of the Hnchak\'s 
historically large membership and the roster of influential 
Hnchaks in recent Armenian-American history, however, 
continue to lend the group a certain degree of clout within 
the Armenian-American community.  Hnchak organizations 
support the weekly \"Massis\" newspaper which claims the 
second-largest circulation among Armenian-American 
publications and posits \"traditional Hnchak\" views on 
Armenian political developments.  (Comment:  While both the 
Ramkavars and Hnchaks retain organizational structures and a 
public profile, they appear to be fading as significant 
forces in the Diaspora, including in the U.S.  End comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
SMALL BUT STRONG - THE ARMENIAN PROTESTANT COMMUNITY 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
19. (SBU) While constituting only roughly 10-15 percent of 
the Armenian community in the United States, the Armenian 
Protestant Community is generally considered the oldest and 
one of the most prominent parts of the U.S. Diaspora.  This 
group traces its roots to the first major emigration of 
Armenians to the United States following the surge of 
American missionary activity in Ottoman Turkey in the late 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The Armenian 
Protestant Community\'s activities center around locally- 
based congregations that sponsor cultural, youth and 
charitable programs.  Embassy sources agree that this 
community\'s strongest centers of support are in New Jersey 
and central and southern California.  This group, while 
generally active in initiatives related to genocide 
awareness, recognition and study, does not subscribe to a 
specific political agenda on Armenia-related issues. 
 
20. (SBU) The Armenian Missionary Association of America 
(AMAA) claims organizational links to the majority of the 
Armenian Protestant churches and operates educational and 
humanitarian programs that benefit Armenian communities in 
the Republic of Armenia and in the Diaspora.  Most experts 
agree that this group, due to its relatively long history in 
the U.S., has one of the strongest financial bases and the 
highest percentage of high profile professionals in the 
United States today.  The Armenian Evangelical Union (AEU) 
represents a smaller portion of the Armenian Protestant 
Community.  Similar to the organizations affiliated with the 
AMAA, AEU congregations sponsor locally based cultural and 
educational initiatives as well as humanitarian efforts in 
the Republic of Armenia. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
ARMENIAN-AMERICAN CATHOLIC ORGANIZATIONS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
21. (SBU) Armenian Catholics living in the United States 
represent a small portion of American-Armenian community 
(claiming membership of roughly 35,000).  Following efforts 
to widen and strengthen its social and grassroots structure 
in the late 1990s, however, the group emerged as a well- 
organized group espousing conservative political and social 
values in line with the teachings of the Armenian Catholic 
Patriarchate (based in Lebanon).  While the Armenian- 
American Catholic community has ties to the American 
Conference of Catholic Bishops and other U.S.-based Catholic 
structures, it functions as an autonomous branch of 
Catholicism with 10 functioning parishes in the United 
States.  These communities are concentrated most heavily in 
New York (home to the Exarchate, the U.S. community\'s 
leader), Los Angeles, Boston and New Jersey. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
PROFESSIONAL AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS ON THE RISE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
22. (SBU) A growing number of professional and cultural 
associations have changed the face of the Armenian-American 
community during the past two decades.  While \"independent\" 
from the clusters of organizations mentioned above, many 
members of these associations likely belong to one or more 
of the cluster organizations.  Groups like the Armenian 
Network, Armenian Bar Association, Armenian American 
International Women\'s Association and Armenian Professional 
and Student Association report increasing membership and are 
expanding their activities.  These groups sponsor advocacy 
efforts in the U.S. as well as programs in Armenia ranging 
from technical assistance and exchange programs to 
humanitarian assistance and service trips. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
HUMANITARIAN GROUPS AND PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
23. (SBU) The United Armenian Fund, which sponsors 
humanitarian shipments to Armenia from the United States, is 
in a unique position among Armenian-American organizations. 
Largely funded by Kirk Kerkorian through his Lincy 
Foundation, the UAF is a joint effort of the Diocese, 
Prelacy, AGBU and other Diasporan organizations.  Focused 
strictly on humanitarian projects, it enjoys virtually 
universal support in the community.  The Hayastan-All- 
Armenia-Fund, a public-private hybrid endeavor with 
significant political backing from the GOAM and Diaspora 
groups in the United States and France, has raised funds for 
humanitarian and infrastructure projects in Nagorno-Karabakh 
and Armenia since the early 1990\'s.  The group was designed 
by advisors to then President Levon Ter-Petrossian as a 
mechanism to mobilize Diasporan financial support.  While 
subject to some internal political intrigue and claims of 
financial mismanagement, the Hayastan-All-Armenia-Fund has 
maintained an extremely high profile among international 
Diaspora organizations and Armenian-Americans from the Los 
Angeles area figure prominently on the organization\'s 
governing board.  The fund\'s annual telethon fundraiser is 
carried internationally via cable networks to cities with 
large Armenian communities.  The organization\'s fundraising 
financed the two major road construction projects in Nagorno- 
Karabakh, the \"East-West\" and \"North-South\" highways. 
 
24. (SBU) Individual Armenian-Americans continue to wield 
considerable influence in Armenia through private 
foundations and endowments such as the Lincy Foundation and 
the Cafesjian Family Foundation.  Kirk Kerkorian\'s Lincy 
Foundation (named for his two daughters) has financed over 
USD 170 million in major infrastructure and small and medium- 
sized loans and grants in Armenia since 1999.  The Lincy 
Foundation was a major contributor (USD 45 million) to 
multilateral housing reconstruction efforts in areas 
affected by the 1988 earthquake including the northern 
cities of Gyumri, Spitak and Vanadzor.  The most recent 
tranche of Lincy Foundation projects included refurbishing 
Armenia\'s major highways linking the country to Georgia and 
Iran, a comprehensive program to restore urban roads and 
sidewalks in downtown Yerevan, rennovation of major cultural 
institutions (including state museums and theaters in 
Yerevan) and the completion of a Soviet-era tunnel project 
connecting Armenia\'s northern regions to the Lake Sevan 
highway interchange.  Lincy Foundation projects are managed 
jointly with the Government of Armenia, follow World Bank 
procurement procedures, and place the organization as one of 
the most significant foreign donors in the country. 
 
25. (SBU) The Cafesjian Family Foundation, sponsored by 
Gerald Cafesjian (of Minnesota and Florida) has donated USD 
40 million to a variety of NGOs and projects within Armenia 
over the past five years.  The most visible of the 
Foundation\'s endeavors was the 2002 agreement with the GOAM 
for the logistical control and dual ownership of Yerevan\'s 
Cascade Monument and a large parcel of property adjacent to 
the structure.  This agreement was a unique move for the 
GOAM in relinquishing majority control of one of the 
country\'s most important public spaces to an Armenian- 
American foundation.  The foundation has refurbished much of 
the public space within the monument complex and has 
announced plans for the construction of a multi-million 
dollar art museum that will sit atop the monument. 
Cafesjian is reportedly already bringing together art works 
from Diasporan collectors that will supplement his personal 
collection once the museum opens.  Cafesjian\'s projects make 
him and his organization a major player in Armenia\'s 
cultural and urban planning circles.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
26. (SBU) As with any community in the United States whose 
membership is based around social or ethnic connections, 
mapping out Armenian-American Diaspora organizations reveals 
as many contradictions as it does watertight theories.  The 
major categories outlined above are quickly changing as new 
generations of Armenian-Americans with different socio- 
economic realities take on leadership roles in these 
organizations and mold their agendas.  Despite the 
contradictions and amorphous borders that divide these 
groups, engaging the U.S.-based Diaspora as a whole remains 
an important aspect of the GOAM\'s foreign policy, economic 
development and public relations strategies.  The GOAM has 
increased its efforts to partner with the Armenian-American 
community through conferences, outreach products and by 
establishing a specialized office within the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  While most GOAM policymakers recognize the 
distinction between USG policy and Diaspora policy, they 
also appreciate the influence that the latter plays on the 
former.  All indications point to a growing tendency on the 
part of the GOAM to capitalize on this dynamic as the U.S- 
Armenia bilateral relationship evolves.

IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS NOT YET IN PLACE

accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) The GOAM has not drafted implementating 
regulations for its alternative military service 
legislation, which went into effect June 1.  The GOAM 
delayed creating the regulations because the law is due 
to be amended in the current session of the National 
Assembly and because the current law states it will 
first apply to new draftees in Fall 2004.  The GOAM has 
not planned procedures for reviewing the cases of draft 
evaders or conscientious objectors currently in prison. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------- 
REGULATIONS DELAYED 
------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenia\'s law on alternative military service 
came into force June 1, but the GOAM has not begun 
drafting implementing regulations.  According to an 
expert on the National Assembly\'s Standing Committee on 
Defense, National Security, and Interior, the 
commission to draft the necessary implementing 
regulations has not yet met.  Commission members knew, 
he said, that the National Assembly intended to amend 
the base legislation during the current session, which 
would invalidate any work done by the commission prior 
to that point.  He told us that the National Assembly 
would either consider the alternative military service 
amendments by the end of this session, June 9, or it 
would call a special session to complete the 
legislative agenda.  According to the expert, the 
members of the National Assembly Standing Committee on 
Defense, National Security, and Interior have already 
drafted the proposed amendments in conjunction with the 
Ministry of Defense.  He stated that the most important 
amendment would replace local draft boards with a 
centralized, special council, charged with adjudicating 
applications for alternative military service, and 
predicted that after adopting the proposed amendments, 
the GOAM would create a new commission to draft the 
implementing legislation. 
 
-------- 
NO HURRY 
-------- 
 
4. (SBU) Armenia drafts young men into the army twice 
yearly:  in the spring and in the fall.  Since the 
legislation states that the law will not affect 
draftees until Fall 2004, the Committee Expert stated 
that the GOAM feels no urgency to clarify procedures 
until that time. 
 
------------------ 
UNADDRESSED ISSUES 
------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) When the National Assembly drafted the 
alternative military service law, several human rights 
NGOs and the Jehovah\'s Witnesses objected that 
alternative service would last 18 months longer than 
the two-year military service (reftel).  None of the 
proposed amendments address this issue.  The 
alternative service law, as currently written, states 
that conscientious objectors in prison may apply for 
alternative military service.  Precisely how those 
conscientious objectors might apply, however, will only 
be clear once implementing regulations are in place. 
According to local NGOs, as of March 29, 2004, 20 
conscientious objectors were serving their sentences 
and three more awaiting trial.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) More than one year into the legislative season, a 
boycotting opposition, spotty attendance by pro-government 
deputies, continued political saber-rattling between parties 
and even occasional filibusters have raised questions as to 
the effectiveness of Armenia\'s National Assembly (NA).  With 
few exceptions, Speaker Artur Baghdasaryan has successfully 
painted a picture of \"legislative business as usual\" in the 
midst of opposition rallies and an uncertain political 
climate.  The absence of opposition party deputies, however, 
has clearly altered the dynamic within the parliament. 
While the governing coalition commands a quorum capable of 
passing new laws, the NA has tabled or voted down draft 
legislation proposed by the GOAM on three occasions, with 
small pro-government parties taking advantage the situation 
to flex their political muscle through abstentions.  The 
Speaker, in coordination with pro-government party offices, 
has taken on a new role as party whip as he is forced to 
call in habitually absent parliamentarians and to ensure 
that pro-government seats are filled during crucial votes. 
We have no remotely reliable indication that President 
Kocharian plans to dissolve the NA.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
EAGER TO PORTRAY A BUSY, PRODUCTIVE PARLIAMENT 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3. (SBU) With only a few exceptions, Speaker Arthur 
Baghdasaryan has successfully painted a picture of 
\"legislative business as usual\" in the midst of opposition 
rallies and an uncertain political climate.  Frequent press 
conferences and media events have highlighted a productive 
National Assembly even though the 22 opposition deputies of 
the Justice Bloc and National Unity Party continue to 
boycott regular sessions.  For their part, pro-government 
coalition parties appear to be making significant efforts to 
counter any indication by media and international observers 
that volatility in Armenian party politics has affected 
parliament\'s operations. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
STILL A QUORUM -- BUT ALSO A NEW DYNAMIC 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The ongoing boycott by opposition deputies has in 
many respects, however, altered the dynamic within the 
National Assembly.  While one can easily categorize 94 of 
the National Assembly\'s 131 Deputies as \"pro-government,\" 
mobilizing these 94 legislators has not been an easy task 
for National Assembly leadership.  The Speaker\'s office and 
governing coalition party offices have had to increase their 
roles as party whips as they are forced to call-in 
habitually truant pro-government parliamentarians and ensure 
that pro-government seats are filled during crucial votes. 
Calls by pro-government deputies to scrutinize attendance 
records against attendance requirements as a way to take 
advantage of a constitutional provision requiring minimal 
attendance and potentially oust the boycotting opposition 
came to nothing.  The possibility that the NA could formally 
scrutinize attendance records worried some deputies 
(specifically a handful in the governing Republican Party) 
who feared any action to remove \"absent\" MPs might adversely 
affect them as well. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
GOAM DRAFTS DON\'T PASS, SMALLER BLOCS FLEX NEWFOUND MUSCLES 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Despite the best efforts of National Assembly 
leaders to paint a rosy picture of parliament for public 
consumption, draft legislation proposed by the GOAM has 
failed to pass on three occasions in recent weeks because of 
procedural difficulties.  GOAM draft laws on higher 
education, declarations of personal income and wealth, and 
licensing regulations in the tourism sector did not receive 
a sufficient number of votes on their third (final) reading 
in the parliament.  On two occasions, deputies from pro- 
government parties did not respond to calls by National 
Assembly leadership to attend the voting sessions, but on 
another occasion, smaller blocs within the parliament (and 
present at the time of the vote) seized the opportunity to 
abstain and in so doing exercise their newfound proportional 
clout in the National Assembly.  The 23 MPs from the 
People\'s Deputy Group and United Labor Party were present in 
the chamber during the final reading of the licensing 
regulation draft law but refused to vote on the issue. 
Leaders from both of these groups suggested during comments 
following the vote that this move was an effort to remind 
Baghdasaryan and coalition leaders that they needed to give 
their parties certain privileges given new realities in the 
National Assembly.  The three failed drafts concerned issues 
important to the GOAM as they related to Council of Europe 
and domestic political commitments.  (Note:  The NA has also 
failed to pass a necessary budgetary expenditure law, which 
could potentially trigger constitutionally mandated 
ministerial resignations.  End Note.)  According to 
newspaper reports, Kocharian and relevant ministers were so 
irritated by the failure of these drafts that they berated 
coalition leaders during a closed-door meeting on June 1. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
COMMENT: KOCHARIAN UNLIKELY TO DISSOLVE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
6. (SBU) Despite isolated rumors that President Kocharian 
might exercise his constitutional right to dissolve 
parliament and call for new elections, analysts suggest that 
the current status quo works to Kocharian\'s advantage. 
Kocharian could see his power base weakened in the event of 
new elections and the threat of dissolution might actually 
serve his purposes in keeping coalition parties including 
Baghdasaryan\'s Orinats-Yerkir (Country of Law) party from 
wandering too far from the \"Kocharian reservation.\"  The 
sources of these rumors (small, independent party leaders or 
party-affiliated newspapers without current representation 
in parliament) are precisely those who would most benefit 
from a call to dissolve parliament and hold new elections. 
GOAM officials from within the executive or the legislature 
have made no indication during recent conversation that they 
expect Kocharian to make such a move nor do they appear to 
be making preparations along such lines.

2. (SBU) The GOAM has formed a Board of Trustees under the 
authority of the Prime Minister Andranik Margaryan with 
Chief Economic Adviser of the President of the Republic of 
Armenia Vahram Nercissiantz as Deputy Chair, to oversee 
Armenia\'s Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) compact 
submission.  Kocharian suggested during his June 1 meeting 
with a Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) delegation led 
by CEO Applegarth that Armenia\'s initial compact submission 
would focus on large-scale infrastructure projects. 
Presidential Chief Economic Advisor Vahram Nercissiantz 
outlined initial plans to finalize MCA compact proposals, 
solicit civil society input and submit the final product to 
the USG by the end of July.  Kocharian appeared to take on 
board MCC admonitions regarding the importance of civil 
society input when creating Armenia\'s MCA compact 
submission.  During a May 31 meeting with Prime Minister 
Andranik Margaryan, GOAM officials including Minister of 
Finance and Economy Khachatrian hinted that Armenia\'s 
initial plans for an MCC compact proposal would likely 
involve the agricultural sector and a large-scale water 
project.  End Summary.

Minister of Transport and Communication Andranik Manoukian, 
and the Chairman of the Water Resources Management Committee 
Andranik Andreassyan.  While short and general in nature, 
the decree does include language empowering the Board to 
establish working groups comprised of GOAM, donor community 
and NGOs presumably for purposes of consultation in 
coordination with a future MCA compact proposal. 
 
4. (SBU) Kocharian suggested during his June 1 meeting with 
a Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) delegation led by 
CEO Applegarth that Armenia\'s initial compact submission 
would focus on large-scale infrastructure projects.  While 
not going into detail, Kocharian revealed a confident 
posture regarding the eventual viability of Armenia\'s 
compact proposal.  Following MCC Applegarth\'s delineation of 
the three criteria against which the USG would scrutinize 
compact proposals (a project\'s positive impact on long-term 
economic growth, input from civil society in the compact 
formulation process and a commitment to continued progress 
on MCA indicators), Kocharian requested that Kchachatryan 
and others at the meeting incorporate these elements into 
Armenia\'s submission. 
 
5. (SBU) Kocharian reported that long delays during the 
implementation of Lincy Foundation projects in 2002 and 2003 
had caused negative internal pressure within his 
administration and from the general public and expressed 
concern that any future MCA compact be negotiated and 
implemented as quickly as possible.  He underscored his 
philosophy that in order to be successful, any MCA project 
would need to impact a wide portion of the population, lest 
it carry the perception of a program designed for the elite 
and implemented by the elite. 
 
6. (SBU) Presidential Chief Economic Advisor Vahram 
Nercissiantz outlined initial plans to finalize MCA compact 
proposals, solicit civil society input and submit the final 
product to the USG by the end of July.  Nercissiantz said 
that a first draft of the compact proposal could be in 
circulation among GOAM entities for comment as early as June 
11.  Kocharian appeared to take on board MCC\'s repeated 
admonitions regarding the importance of civil society input 
when creating Armenia\'s MCA compact submission.  By the end 
of the meeting, Kocharian and Nercissiantz made references 
to initiating a new set of civil society consultations in 
contrast to earlier suggestions that former consultative 
processes (specifically those related to Armenia\'s Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper) might already count toward this 
exercise. 
 
7. (SBU) During a May 31 meeting with Prime Minister 
Andranik Margaryan, GOAM officials hinted that Armenia\'s 
initial plans for an MCC compact proposal would likely 
involve the agricultural sector and a large-scale water 
project.  The Prime Minister openly deferred to Minister of 
Finance and Economy Khachatrian on detailed points of 
substance, foreshadowing the June 1 presidential decree and 
paralleling suggestions by various GOAM officials that the 
Ministry of Finance and Economy would serve as the principal 
ministry in charge of future MCA issues. 
 
8.  Begin text of the June 1 Presidential Decree:

PROJECT ENERGIZES LOCAL INVOLVEMENT 
----------------------------------- 
 
1. (U) Ambassador Ordway, accompanied by regional GOAM 
representatives and local press, inaugurated the newly 
completed Noyemberyan Sport School facility June 2 in 
Armenia\'s northeastern Tavush region.  The ceremony marked 
the completion of the first project sponsored by the USG\'s 
\"Community Self-Help Fund\" (CSHF) initiative in Armenia.  A 
grant of USD 10,500 was used to leverage funding from the 
GOAM and a municipal relief organization in Greece to 
refurnish the complex, purchase safe recreational equipment 
from reputable suppliers, repair an unsafe fence and 
lighting in the park area adjacent to the school and 
renovate the area for public use.  Media coverage of the 
event noted the project\'s early and under-budget completion 
and echoed Ambassador Ordway\'s call for increased private- 
public collaboration at the local level to improve living 
standards in Armenia\'s rural areas.  Local leaders praised 
the effort as a way to mobilize local architectural and 
construction talent that had been underutilized in this 
border town since the outbreak of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
COMMUNTITY SELF-HELP FUND FOSTERS LOCAL COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. (U) The sport school was one of the ten successful 
applicants who were awarded small grants during the first 
tranche of funding from the CSHF project.  The CSHF program 
awards communities who successfully mobilize local resources 
through proven and effective NGO mechanisms to offer a 
significant portion of capital needed for local 
infrastructure projects that address urgent community needs. 
As part of the program, NGOs must work with local businesses 
and municipal authorities to ensure that program activities 
will not be blocked and that they will receive support from 
appropriate civic entities upon completion.  Sustainability 
was a key factor in granting funds for the CSHF projects. 
In the case of the Noyemberyan Sports School, the local NGO 
identified a market for clean, affordable lodging in the 
region (there are no hotels in a 40 mile radius) and 
refurbished part of the complex to serve as a hotel 
facility.  An overwhelming 250 eligible applications 
competed for the first round of CSHF funding. 
 
3. (U) The United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID) is managing the project through the 
local offices of Save the Children.  Post will continue to 
refine the program as a complementary arm of ongoing USG 
technical assistance for NGOs and government strengthening 
at the local level.  A second call for proposals is expected 
by June 31.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Faced with dismal rally attendance, Armenian 
opposition leaders made announcements June 5 
acknowledging their failure to receive sufficient 
popular support for \"decisive actions\" aimed at ousting 
President Kocharian.  Instead of launching a promised 
\"permanent\" protest action, the June 4 opposition rally 
in downtown Yerevan turned into a low-key event 
attended by only one or two thousand people. 
Opposition leaders subsequently announced they would 
take a break to address \"organizational issues.\" 
Meanwhile, a number of NGOs and human rights groups 
continued to conduct protest actions in front of the 
Procurator General\'s office demanding the release of 
all detainees.  (There are currently 4 people in 
detention, 3 of whom are already serving sentences on 
criminal charges and one awaiting a court hearing). 
End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
OPPOSITION BACKS OFF FROM \"DECISIVE ACTION\" PROMISES 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (U) Only one to two thousand people attended the 
latest opposition rally held in downtown Yereavn on 
June 4.  More importantly, opposition leaders appeared 
to abandon hopes of ousting President Kocharian by 
admitting failure to build sufficient support.  Most 
analysts attribute the opposition\'s failure to a lack 
of public confidence in its ability to bring about real 
change in the political struggle.  Disagreements 
between opposition leaders have also undermined the 
public\'s faith in the effectiveness of the opposition 
movement.  Republic Party leader Albert Bazeyan 
publicly apologized to the crowd on June 5, saying, \"We 
believe that we are not yet ready to carry out actions 
needed for achieving our final victory.\"  Bazeyan added 
that the opposition would need to \"take some time off\" 
because it had failed to solve a number of internal 
organizational issues. 
 
3. (SBU) During the nearly three-hour rally, speeches 
ranged from vague, flowery declamations to harsh 
criticism of the government\'s anti-corruption strategy. 
The most indefatigable speaker, National Unity leader 
Artashes Geghamian, provided the crowd with a blow-by- 
blow account of his battle with the Chairman of the New 
Times Party, Aram Krapetian, who has sued Geghamian for 
libel as the latest installment of internal conflicts 
among opposition parties.  Republic Party leader Aram 
Sargsyan openly admitted that opposition leaders had 
been overly optimistic in their recent statements to 
crowds of opposition supporters in an effort to bolster 
spirits and garner more support.  Sargsyan said there 
might be a smaller opposition protest on June 16 but 
appeared tentative at best about prospects for the 
gathering. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
NGOS PROTEST AGAINST POLITICALLY MOTIVATED DETENTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
4. (SBU) A group of NGOs and human rights activists 
continued to stage sporadic protest actions in front of 
the Procurator General\'s office demanding the release 
of the remaining handful of detained participants of 
the opposition rallies.  These groups have staged such 
protests on-and-off since mid-April, following the 
police crackdown and subsequent arrests of protesters 
involved with opposition rallies in front of the 
National Assembly.  As of June 14, there were four 
people in detention, including three people formally 
under arrest on criminal charges and one person 
awaiting a court hearing.  Former Defense Minister 
Vargharshak Harutyunian was detained and charged with 
\"publicly insulting\" senior government officials.  The 
opposition has dismissed this charge as politically 
motivated.  (He was subsequently released from custody 
on June 11).  Citing official court statistics, the 
head of the International Union of Armenian Lawyers, 
Tigran Ter-Yesayan, stated that since April 14, more 
than 400 people have been subjected to administrative 
detention and/or penalties for participating in 
opposition rallies.  Opposition party activists and 
NGOs confirm, however, that there were no new 
detentions following the latest rally on June 4. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) Having failed to win wide-spread public 
support, the fractured opposition seems to be 
retreating for the moment, and has started to hint that 
they may be ready to end their boycott and return to 
the National Assembly for the fall legislative season. 
We believe that the current government can rest easy 
unless and until the opposition manages to develop a 
policy program that would win over the hearts of a 
skeptical Armenian public.

SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES CITIZEN CONCERNS IN ARMENIA\'S 
SYUNIK REGION 
 
 
1. (U) Summary:  Ambassador Ordway discussed USG assistance 
programs and current events with Armenians living in the 
southern province of Syunik during a town hall meeting June 
8 in the provincial capital of Kapan.  The meeting was part 
of a broader schedule of USG assistance site visits and 
political consultations with representatives from regional 
and local government bodies.  Armenians raised the issues of 
education, youth programs, refugees and infrastructure needs 
and asked the Ambassador to continue looking for ways to 
match USG assistance programming to urgent needs at the 
local level.  National and regional press covered the event 
which was organized through a network of local NGOs active 
in democracy and governance.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
TOWN HALL MEETING BRINGS TOGETHER NGOS, AMCITS, GOAM REPS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (U) Ambassador Ordway met with Armenians living in the 
southern province of Syunik to discuss USG assistance and 
current events during a town hall meeting June 8 in the 
provincial capital of Kapan.  Volunteers from local NGOs 
active in democracy and governance issues constituted the 
majority of the participants.  Local government leaders, 
Amcits living in the region and citizens interested in U.S.- 
Armenia issues also attended the event. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
PEOPLE SPEAK OUT ON EDUCATION, YOUTH, RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
3. (U) Following the screening of a video presentation 
summarizing USG assistance efforts in Armenia, Armenians 
posed questions on a wide range of assistance-related 
issues.  Educators from local schools raised the issue of 
how the USG chose schools for programs including the 
Armenian School Connectivity Program and USAID\'s Public 
Works Project (a countrywide structural rehabilitation 
program involving schools and other municipal buildings). 
Educators and municipal leaders said there was a continued 
need for youth programs in the province and expressed their 
perception that there were increasingly limited government 
resources in this area.  Participants also raised questions 
about USG and donor community approaches to the most urgent 
needs of refugee communities, including housing and 
employment. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
MATCHING ASSISTANCE TO \"EVERYDAY NEEDS\" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) A common theme among participants\' questions and 
comments was a perceived need by Armenians in the Syunik 
region to better channel their input to the government and 
donor organizations like the USG regarding future assistance 
programs.  Attendees from both government and NGO 
organizations suggested that their opinions regarding urgent 
assistance needs at the local level were not a central part 
of the policy-making process.  Ambassador Ordway responded 
to these concerns by outlining USG assistance strategies and 
the newly-adopted USAID five-year strategy.  He also 
mentioned the upcoming consultative process related to the 
GOAM\'s Millennium Challenge Account compact submission and 
encouraged civic organizations to stay abreast of MCA 
developments and voice their input. 
 
----------------------------------- 
ASSISTANCE SITES IN ARMENIA\'S SOUTH 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The town hall meeting was part of a broader schedule 
of USG assistance site visits and consultations with local 
leaders in the Syunik region.  The Ambassador and 
representatives from USAID and Peace Corps visited USG 
assistance project sites including a meeting with GOAM 
officials at the Armenia-Iran border control point in 
Meghri, a Community Self Help Fund renovation project in the 
region\'s largest elementary school, a newly privatized 
mining facility involving significant investment from U.S. 
investors, Peace Corps volunteers in the town of Goris.  The 
Ambassador also presided at the inauguration of a newly- 
renovated psychiatric hospital in Kapan.  The hospital 
project involved USG funding and cooperation from four other 
humanitarian assistance providers.  Regional government and 
Ministry of Health representatives praised the project as a 
prime example of collaboration among the donor community. 
The Ambassador also consulted with the Marzpet (Governor) 
and mayors as part of the trip schedule. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
DESPITE UPCOMING ELECTION, LITTLE POLITICAL BUZZ 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6. (U) Despite a regional by-election scheduled for June 13 
and a flurry of activity among opposition politicians in 
April and May, there was relatively little discussion among 
town hall participants or government interlocutors about 
political issues during the Ambassador\'s visit.  (Note:  The 
election for the majoritarian seat in Armenia\'s National 
Assembly was called after MP Suren Khachatryan was appointed 
Syunik\'s new marzpet in March 2004.  Only one candidate, 
Vahan Hakobyan remained in the race.  Hakobyan is the son of 
Kocharian supporter Maxim Hakobyan -- a wealthy and 
influential business figure with considerable ties to 
Syunik\'s mining industry.  End note.)  When asked about the 
election, most Armenians expressed confidence that Hakobyan 
would garner the necessary fifty percent of the vote and 
take the election.  NGOs active in democracy and governance 
programs expressed similar views following the town hall 
meeting and even went so far as to predict an \"uneventful\" 
election on June 13 (septel).

comments. 
 
3. (SBU) Comment. The original alternative military 
service legislation took effect June 1 and was to apply 
to the Fall 2004 draft.  Post does not believe that 
implementation procedures can be ready by that time. 
Coordination between the Ministry of Defense and the 
National Assembly is at best a complicated bureaucratic 
process, and both sides appear unhurried to implement 
alternative military service provisions.  Post believes 
the law cannot realistically be implemented for new 
draftees before Spring 2005.  In the meantime, GOAM 
officials have given no tentative dates for the release 
of 23 conscientious objectors, currently in detention, 
who are affected by the new legislation. End comment

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Vahe Hakobian, parliamentary candidate 
endorsed by Prime Minister Andranik Margaryan\'s 
Republican Party, ran unopposed during parliamentary by- 
elections in the southern province of Syunik on June 
13.  According to preliminary figures announced by the 
Territorial Election Commission, Hakobian won 97 per 
cent of the votes cast in the single-mandate individual 
constituency.  Sources reported to Post observers that 
the other contenders dropped out of the race earlier 
given Hakobian\'s ties to big business in Syunik 
(through his wealthy and politically prestigious 
father), strong backing from the Republican Party, and 
the fact that Kocharian\'s elder son Sedrak ran 
Hakobian\'s election campaign.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
HAKOBIAN WINS, HIGH VOTER TURNOUT 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Vahe Hakobian, the twenty-seven-year-old 
candidate endorsed by Prime Minister Andranik 
Margaryan\'s Republican Party, appeared the clear winner 
of an unopposed parliamentary by-election held in 
Armenia\'s southern province of Syunik on June 13. 
Preliminary figures received from the Territorial 
Election Commission showed that Hakobian won 97 percent 
of 22,345 votes cast in the single-mandate 
constituency.  277 votes were cast against Hakobian, 
and 310 votes were declared invalid.  The commission 
claimed that more than 60 per cent of the province\'s 
eligible voters took part in the election.  (Note: 
such a high turnout relative to other Armenian 
provinces is not unusual for the politically active 
area of Syunik, a traditional political stronghold for 
President Kocharian and his supporters.  End note.)  A 
team of Embassy staff serving as election monitors 
observed no serious violations or incidents during 
Sunday\'s voting at 14 polling stations.   According to 
the monitors\' internal report, the election was well 
organized and there appeared to be fewer complaints 
regarding inaccuracies in the voters list compared to 
previous elections.  There were no observed nor 
reported incidents of unruly behavior or disturbances 
during the electoral proceedings. 
 
------------------------------ 
HAKOBIAN\'S CONTENDERS DROP OUT 
------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) Hakobian enjoyed the full support of the local 
administration, including newly appointed governor of 
Syunik, Suren Khachatrian, early into the campaign. 
The four opposing bipartisan candidates dropped out of 
the race at various points leading up to June 13, 
leaving Hakobian unopposed.  Local sources told Embassy 
staff that Hakobian\'s contenders dropped out because 
Hakobian is the son of prominent Syunik businessman 
Maxim Hakobian (the director of the area\'s largest and 
most successful copper mine in the city of Kajaran). 
They claimed that Hakobian\'s contenders were not able 
to raise adequate funds for their campaigns and could 
not compete with Hakobian\'s publicity and grassroots 
network.  Other sources believed that the opposing 
candidates dropped out because they were intimidated by 
the fact that Hakobian\'s election campaign was run by 
President Kocharian\'s elder son Sedrak. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4. (SBU) While relatively \"uneventful\" as predicted by 
analysts (reftel), the June 13 Syunik elections were 
poised to be the first electoral barometer of politics 
in Armenia since the controversial presidential and 
parliamentary elections in Spring 2003.  The elections 
were a sure-bet opportunity for the new Central 
Election Commission Chariman, Garegin Azaryan, to show 
improvement over previous balloting to international 
observers and critics.  He appeared to capitalize on 
the opportunity by traveling to Syunik and was an 
active, albeit quiet presence in the region on June 13. 
Local leaders were quick to portray the elections as 
smooth and \"democratic.\"  Many regional and municipal 
leaders did not view the fact that a single candidate 
remained the race as a strange phenomenon, but rather 
an indication of an orderly political process.  Albeit 
uneventful, the June 13 election definitely proved that 
the power of Kocharian\'s personality still reigns 
strong in Armenia\'s Syunik province and that big 
business still commands big portions of the vote for 
Armenia\'s MPs.  End comment.

hosted the GOAM\'s first \"consultative session\" with the 
public regarding the MCA on June 4.  Approximately fifty 
representatives from the GOAM, NGOs, businesses and donor

these brief introductory remarks.  Ambassador Ordway 
underscored the fact that MCA funding was not guaranteed for 
Armenia and emphasized the fact that MCA compacts would have 
to be competitive in order to win MCC funding.  He also 
encouraged the GOAM to take its time in conducting the 
consultative process, echoing MCC delegation comments that a 
quality consultative process was one of the key elements for 
a successful MCA compact. 
 
4. (U) IFI and Multilateral Organization representatives 
made brief presentations as part of the meeting.  UN 
Resident Representative Lise Grande congratulated meeting 
participants for proposing projects that complemented 
Armenia\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).  She 
urged GOAM leadership not to allow any future MCA funding to 
eclipse ongoing economic growth projects (specifically job 
creation efforts).  World Bank Representative Roger Robinson 
said the World Bank would not reduce funding for Armenia 
even if a successful MCA compact involved sectors in which 
his organization already sponsored ongoing projects.  He 
offered World Bank technical support for any projects 
involving rural water accessibility and road rehabilitation. 
IMF Resident Representative James McHugh said that private 
sector growth should not be ignored during the formulation 
of a successful MCA compact.  According to McHugh, private 
sector growth remains key to accomplishing MCA objectives 
and should be part of the GOAM\'s focus when designing its 
compact.

PRESIDENT\'S CHIEF ADVISOR ON CONSULTATIVE PROCESS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5. (SBU) President Kocharian\'s Chief Economic Advisor Vahram 
Nercissiantz told us June 11 that he, as part of the GOAM\'s 
MCC Board, was anxious for feedback on the GOAM\'s 
consultative process with the public regarding an MCA 
compact.  He said that the GOAM was planning to 
institutionalize the involvement of the business community 
by formalizing the activity of the High Business Council (a 
business forum consisting of important local private sector 
representatives) as part of the consultative process. 
Nercissiantz said that the Prime Minister had appointed 
someone from his office to act as MCA recorder.  This person 
would record notes and compile recommendations from the 
various consultative meetings for use by the GOAM MCA Board. 
The Ambassador and Nercissiantz discussed the utility of 
following a model similar to the June 4 meeting (allowing 
NGOs to present ideas before GOAM representatives and 
allowing press to be present and document the event) during 
subsequent consultations with the public.  Nercissiantz 
agreed that the consultative process should move beyond 
Yerevan and include the widest possible range of local NGOs. 
Both sides discussed the need for the consultative process 
to serve as more than mere \"cover\" for a GOAM-backed 
proposal.  They discussed ways for the GOAM to incorporate 
public feedback during the compact design phase. 
 
6. (SBU) Nercissiantz stood by earlier forecasts that the 
GOAM would be ready to submit an MCA compact proposal to the 
MCC by the end of July.  He mentioned upcoming travel by 
GOAM representatives (including FM Oskanian\'s June 14-15 
trip to Washington and Nercissiantz\' own plans to visit 
Washington in July) as an opportunity to meet with MCC 
officials and other stakeholders in advance of officially 
submitting the GOAM\'s first draft compact proposal. 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
WIDE PRESS COVERAGE, INCLUDING SOME INCORRECT RUMORS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7. (U) There was wide press coverage of the MCC delegation 
visit to Armenia and MCC Chairman Applegarth\'s June 1 press 
conference.  Nearly all television outlets and newspapers 
carried footage of Applegarth\'s statements, including clear 
indications that there was neither a pre-arranged guarantee 
of MCA funding for Armenia nor a tentative agreement 
regarding funding levels for countries. 
 
8. (SBU) Subsequent press reports regarding MCA included 
wide coverage of the June 4 consultative meeting and were 
mostly objective.  Among the most notable themes of the 
press coverage of the first consultative meeting was the 
fact that well-known political figures (including GOAM 
National Minorities and Regional Issues Representative 
Hranush Kharatian and \"Dignity\" Party founder Lyudmila 
Harutyunian) used the forum not only to discuss MCA but to 
voice concern over the effectiveness of the GOAM\'s long-term 
economic strategy in rural areas. 
 
9. (SBU) A problematic statement made by Minister of Finance 
and Economy Vardan Khachatryan on June 9 to the ARKA news 
agency, however, has clouded otherwise objective and on-task 
reporting regarding MCA.  According to the statement, 
reportedly made to an individual journalist and not as part 
of an MCA-related meeting or press availability, Khachatryan 
previewed the GOAM\'s intention to rollout an MCA compact 
involving a five-year schedule of projects in multiple 
sectors totaling over USD 600 million.  Khachatryan 
reportedly told reporters that while the GOAM would support 
any \"worthy\" proposal suggested by the public as part of its 
MCA compact submission, the GOAM was looking primarily at 
rural water accessibility and road rehabilitation. 
(Comment:  The context of Khachatryan\'s reported comments 
remains unclear and Post has been unsuccessful in obtaining 
official clarification from him or his office.  End 
comment.)

  1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  While the formation of the 
Government\'s Interagency Commission to Address Issues 
related to Human Trafficking was encouraging, lack of a 
Commission Head for several months last year significantly 
slowed down the Government\'s response to TIP.  As reported 
reftel, the Commission believes that coordination has been 
the biggest overriding problem.  With a Commission Head now 
in place, the Commission has recently taken concrete steps 
to ensure better coordination through the Commission and has 
requested that their mandate be expanded and further defined 
to improve their ability to coordinate all Government action 
in this important area, as well as to improve implementation 
of the National Plan of Action.  International and non- 
governmental organizations in Armenia have continued to take 
concrete steps to better inform the Armenian population of 
the trafficking phenomenon and assist victims.  The Armenian 
Governmental Commission has readily participated in these 
endeavors, and we have seen increasingly strong 
collaboration between government and service-providing NGOs 
over the last several months on specific cases, although 
there still needs to be better overall coordination.  We are 
hopeful that the Government of Armenia will begin its own 
initiatives toward combating this abhorrent phenomenon.  The 
GOAM Commission reports that although coordination with a 
new UNDP Anti-TIP Program funded by the Norwegian Government 
has been poor to date, they believe that they are close to 
reconciling this issue.  We are hopeful that the GOAM will 
in fact be able to improve cooperation with the UNDP program 
in an effort to decrease overlap between that program and 
USG-funded programs currently being implemented.  Paras 2-4 
update the 2003-2004 Anti-TIP Strategy Recommendations to 
the Government of Armenia and establish new goals for 2004- 
2005.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) Recommended steps to improve prevention that the 
Government of Armenia should take to combat trafficking in 
persons in Armenia include: 
 
GOAL: Establish consistent translations of key terminology 
and definitions from the Palermo Convention, including 
trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling.  The resulting 
terminology and definitions should be used consistently 
throughout all relevant public awareness, legislation and 
other documentation. 
 
UPDATE: The GOAM Commission has made several amendments to 
anti-TIP legislation with an aim to clarify and better 
define terminology, which will greatly contribute to this 
goal.  The National Assembly will consider changes in the 
next few months. 
 
GOAL: Approval of the National Plan of Action (NPA) by the 
GOAM and beginning of implementation. 
 
UPDATE: ACCOMPLISHED.  The GOAM should now focus on improved 
implementation of the NPA.  The GOAM Commission agreed in a 
meeting last week to utilize the USG-funded anti-TIP website 
for Armenia (www.antitip.am) to publicize GOAM initiatives 
to improve transparency. 
 
GOAL: Allocate appropriate government staff and resources to 
track implementation of the NPA. 
 
UPDATE: ACCOMPLISHED.  The GOAM allocated the equivalent of 
USD 11, 000 to the Commission to implement anti-TIP 
initiatives.  The Commission believes that this sum is 
merely symbolic, but attributes this to the fact that the 
request was made after the national budget was approved. 
They intend to make a more substantial request for the 
coming year\'s budget.  We urge the GOAM to allocate the 
required resources. 
 
GOAL: Include trafficking in persons in the Poverty 
Reduction Strategy (PRSP), especially concerning vulnerable 
groups, including women, children and refugees.  For 
example, attention to this issue within the job creation 
component of the PRSP with an aim to reduce the number of 
vulnerable women can positively impact trafficking 
prevention. 
 
UPDATE: The Human Rights Desk of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs has been working actively with the World Bank to 
ensure inclusion of TIP in the PRSP.  We should continue to 
track the PRSP document for additions. 
 
GOAL: Improve the incorporation of issues related to 
children, especially children in institutions and from 
vulnerable families, in all aspects of trafficking 
prevention and relevant action plans. 
 
3.  (SBU) We recommend addressing trafficking in persons in 
the broader context of the UN Transnational Organized Crime 
Convention to ensure attention to international standards 
and practices and harmonization within the region.  In 
addition, this will ensure that not only is trafficking 
criminalized, but also that key criminal code amendments are 
made to ensure effective implementation of legislation put 
in place, which are also needed to effectively combat trans- 
national crime in general.  It is important to focus, 
however, not only on the Criminal and Criminal Procedure 
Codes, but also on the Labor Code, social welfare/family 
legislation and anti-corruption legislation, enforcement and 
implementation to ensure a comprehensive approach to this 
complex issue.  In the case of issues related to trafficking 
in minors, Armenia has not taken significant steps to ratify 
several key international agreements to protect the rights 
of children, namely the Hague Convention; ILO Convention 182 
and the Optional Protocols to the Child Rights Convention. 
We strongly believe that Armenia should act swiftly on these 
issues. 
 
We support UNHCR in its assertion that seeking asylum is a 
universally recognized right. As UNHCR points out, many 
refugees, because of their desperate situation, may have no 
other option to reach safety in asylum countries than 
engaging the services of smugglers, some falling into the 
hands of traffickers. UNHCR urges that access to asylum be 
kept open in strict compliance with the \"Saving Clause\" 
contained in both the Trafficking and Smuggling Protocols. 
In particular, UNHCR strongly recommends that the \"Saving 
Clause\" be reflected in a specific provision of the RA 
Criminal Code.  Furthermore, inclusion into the same Code of 
an article that exempts asylum-seekers from being punished 
for the fact of having utilized the services of a smuggler 
in order to escape from feared persecution is recommended. 
This would reflect the obligation of non-penalization set 
forth in Article 31 (1) of the 1951 Convention, in addition 
to being consistent with Article 5 of the Smuggling 
Protocol.  Finally, those persons who effectively facilitate 
smuggling for humanitarian reasons, assisting asylum-seekers 
to flee from the country where they fear persecution into 
Armenia without any financial gain, should not be subject to 
prosecution under the Criminal Code.  Given the nexus 
between smuggling and trafficking and the fact that refugees 
and smuggled migrants are a high-risk group for trafficking, 
we strongly support UNHCR\'s endeavors in this area but do 
not link progress on this area to tier status for Armenia. 
 
The following steps are recommended to improve the 
Government of Armenia\'s ability to prosecute trafficking 
related cases: 
 
GOAL: Legal Analysis of gaps in current legislation.  The 
Government of Armenia\'s support and substantive 
collaboration to the USG-funded initiative by OSCE in this 
area are essential. 
 
UPDATE: OSCE\'s international expert and a team of 3 national 
experts are currently working on the legislative gap 
analysis.  The first draft package of amendments to the 
Criminal Procedure Code was submitted to the OSCE Office in 
Yerevan; simultaneously, the package was sent for comment to 
relevant agencies/members of the Armenian Government Working 
Group on Criminal Procedure Code Amendments and then forward 
to the OSCE expert.  In July 2004, it is expected that OSCE 
will convene an expert-level meeting in Yerevan.  The 
meeting will provide a forum for the relevant state 
authorities, NGOs and bar associations to discuss the 
proposed amendments with the international expert.  In July 
2004, Phase 1 of the project (focus on procedural safeguards 
of victim/witness protection) will be essentially completed 
(although follow-up with the National Assembly will continue 
beyond July 2004 into fall 2004) and Phase 2 (focus on non- 
procedural safeguards/assessment of prerequisites for 
creation of a witness protection program - including 
recommendations for a separate Law on Witness 
Protection) will commence. 
 
GOAL: Amendment of Criminal Code Article 132 and/or 
ratification of a Trafficking in Persons Law. 
 
UPDATE: The GOAM Commission has drafted amendments for 
consideration by the National Assembly.  Relevant GOAM 
agencies are working with the OSCE Legislative Strengthening 
Program, funded by the USG.  We are hopeful that this 
cooperation will continue and produce visible results in 
2004. 
 
GOAL: Specific legislation or amendments to existing 
legislation not linked to cooperation in criminal 
investigation or prosecution, addressing both victim 
protection and witness protection. 
 
UPDATE: Phase I of the OSCE Legislative Strengthening 
Program is expected completed in July 2004.  Phase II will 
begin shortly thereafter and will focus on this issue. 
Active collaboration by the relevant GOAM agencies is 
essential. 
 
GOAL: We strongly recommend specific legislation or 
amendments to existing legislation that comply with the 
\"Saving Clause\" in the Trafficking and Smuggling Protocols, 
but we do not link this to tier status. 
 
GOAL: Ratification of Optional Protocols to UN Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and ratification of ILO Convention 
182. 
 
UPDATE: GOAM experienced seriously delays in this process. 
Recently, there has been improved impetus within the GOAM to 
accomplish these goals.  We are hopeful that the GOAM will 
finalize ratification in 2004. 
 
GOAL: Ratification of the Hague Convention followed by the 
development of procedures and bilateral agreements to 
monitor inter-country adoptions.  While we do not propose a 
specific timeline for ratification, we encourage the 
Government of Armenia to take steps toward this goal over 
the next year. 
 
UPDATE: Ratification is currently a contentious issue within 
the GOAM.  The overwhelming opinion seems to be that there 
are several steps that should be taken to address these 
issue through creation of internal legislation and 
procedures, especially related to adoption.  The GOAM would 
then seek expert assistance to identify gaps and priorities, 
and only then take the steps necessary for ratification.  We 
believe it is important to continue to encourage the GOAM to 
address this important issue. 
 
GOAL: Training for law enforcement, advocates and the 
judiciary to sensitize them to the issue of trafficking in 
persons and educate them on relevant changes and additions 
to national legislation.  We recommend a particular emphasis 
on Border Guards and Consular Officials overseas. 
 
UPDATE: The National Police began providing some training 
for law enforcement.  The USG, through IOM, supports an 
initiative for the Consular Section of the MFA and Consular 
Officers abroad.  GOAM-led initiatives in this area should 
be greatly expanded and be incorporated into standard local 
training programs. 
 
GOAL: Begin discussions on more regular cooperation with 
destination countries, notably the UAE and Germany.  Expand 
contacts in other potential destination countries, such as 
Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Russia. 
 
UPDATE: On a practical law enforcement level, cooperation 
has steadily increased.  We encourage the GOAM to continue 
to increase cooperation in this area and take steps to 
formalize bilateral cooperation.  We further encourage the 
GOAM to promote bilateral and regional cooperation beyond 
law enforcement. 
 
4.  (SBU) The National Plan of Action and Governmental 
Commission\'s Concept Paper have been ratified and 
disseminated to international organizations and NGOs.  We 
applaud this level of transparency with local and 
international partners. There is a need for further research 
to address issues related to the scope of trafficking, 
especially related to child adoptions, orphanages and 
Internats (boarding schools).  Further research will help to 
establish potential and actual victim profiles, thereby 
assisting the Government of Armenia and the NGO and donor 
communities to better focus prevention and victim assistance 
and protection programs.  The USG has provided funding to 2 
organizations to conduct such research.  We are extremely 
concerned by the Commission\'s intention to conduct separate 
research, which will be much smaller in scope.  Varying 
results may provide an ideal excuse for the GOAM to attempt 
to minimize the problem and discount the findings of the USG- 
funded study.  Future steps to improve protection of victims 
include: 
 
GOAL: Research to identify trafficking trends and victim 
profiles. 
 
UPDATE: The State Department has provided funding to two 
local NGOs to accomplish this task during 2004.  The 
Government of Armenia\'s support to this initiative will be 
critical.  We appreciate the GOAM\'s support to date to this 
initiative in providing a representative from the 
Governmental Commission to participate in the selection 
board to review program proposals.  We are hopeful that the 
Government of Armenia will also promote adequate access and 
transparency for the NGO conducting research to the relevant 
government institutions and agencies.  Given the GOAM\'s 
scarce resources to address TIP, we are hopeful that the 
GOAM will cooperate closely with this initiative, rather 
than duplicate this effort by going forth with its plans for 
a study. 
 
GOAL: Establishment of hotlines for both prevention and 
returnee assistance. 
 
UPDATE: The State Department currently supports a program 
(through IOM) by a local NGO to assist victims that includes 
a hotline.  More than 100 people from all over Armenia have 
contacted the hotline since its inception.  We understand 
that UNDP, in cooperation with UMCOR, intends to begin 
operating a hotline.  We are hopeful that efforts will be 
closely coordinated given that multiple hotlines with 
different procedures could result in confusion among at- 
risk/potential users.  Furthermore, better cooperation 
between implementers would also benefit data collection on 
victims. 
 
GOAL: Establishment of safehavens and reintegration centers 
for returnees, which will provide legal, medical and 
psychological assistance, and also socio-economic 
reintegration and appropriate monitoring of the process. 
 
UPDATE: The State Department currently supports a program 
(through IOM) by a local NGO to assist victims that includes 
safehavens and legal, medical and psychological assistance 
to returnees.  Law enforcement has referred suspected 
victims to this shelter-a sign that collaboration between 
NGOs and Armenian Government agencies is improving.   We 
understand that UNDP, in cooperation with UMCOR, intends to 
begin a similar program.  Without sufficient data on the 
trafficking phenomenon to include the type of victim (men, 
women, children) and the type of trafficking they are 
subjected to, victim assistance programs should be created 
that will allow for flexibility.  We are hopeful that the 
upcoming USG-funded research will provide much of the 
information required to better understand Armenian victim 
profiles. 
 
5.  COMMENT.  We have commended the GOAM on continued Tier 2 
status but also made it clear that more has to be done.  We 
have repeatedly sent the message that actual GOAM buy-in or 
ownership of the problem is critical-- TIP is not a donor 
issue, but an issue for Armenia with global tie-ins.  Now 
that the Head of the Commission is in place and the 
Government has approved the National Plan of Action, the 
focus should be on actual implementation of the NPA and 
better coordination of the interagency process.  END 
COMMENT.

Classified by Ambassador John Ordway.  Reasons:  1.5 (B, 
D). 
 
1.  (C)  Following receipt of reftel, DAO assistant spoke 
with the CHOD, Gen-Lt. Haratunyan, and Ambassador spoke to 
Ambassador Kasprzyk and Acting Foreign Minister Shugarian. 
The CHOD claimed that the Azeri side had initiated the 
outbreak of hostile action a week ago, and then on the 
night of June 14/15 began shelling an Armenian village. 
The Armenian side \"shot back.\"  At 02:00 Ambassador 
Kasprzyk called the CHOD while monitoring on the Azeri 
side.  The CHOD said he had told Kasprzyk that if the 
Azeris continued the shelling, Armenia would take the hill 
that apparently was the original Azeri position before they 
moved forward a week ago.  Haratunyan said that the 
Armenian MOD had been unable to establish any contact with 
the Azeri side, and was using Ambassador Kasprzyk to pass 
messages to Baku.  He did not provide any timeline (or 
deadline) for the threatened Armenian forward movement. 
 
2.  (C)  Ambassador spoke to Kasprzyk by phone shortly 
after he had completed his June 14/15 monitoring mission. 
Kasprzyk, en route to Tbilisi, said that it had not been 
quiet the previous night.  The monitoring that had just 
been completed had established that one Armenian officer 
had been killed, while on the Azeri side a woman and a 
child had been injured.  In addition, livestock on the 
Azeri side had been killed.  Kasprzyk said that he could 
not determine which side had started the firing the night 
before.  He theorized that the Armenians had subjected the 
Azeri village of Mazamly to a barrage as a means of 
psychological pressure, and that the casualties were the 
result of rounds that had actually landed in the village. 
The attack clearly had frightened and enraged the 
villagers.  8-10 of them came to the monitoring site (2 km 
from the village).  Aggravated by \"untactful\" remarks by 
the Azeri military escorts, the villagers were 
extraordinarily hostile.  The Azeri military decided to 
leave the scene before the villagers engaged in violent 
action against them. 
 
3.  (C)  The Armenian side requested, through the field 
monitors, a face-to-face meeting with the Azeri local 
commander.  The Azeris refused, and requested a discussion 
with the Armenian local commander via the OSCE radio 
connection.  The Armenian side refused.  The Azeri side 
then indicated that they would be willing to have a face- 
to-face meeting.  This, however, requires the approval of 
the Minister of Defense.  Although Kasprzyk told the 
Ambassador he was very doubtful the Minister would agree, 
he planned to pursue this option with the Minister on June 
16.  (The Minister is out of the country, and is returning 
the morning of June 16.) 
 
4.  (C)  Kasprzyk said that the situation was tense and 
very dangerous.  There is considerable and constant 
military movement, and both sides appear to be reinforcing 
their positions -- which are very close to each other. 
Each side, he believes, feels it is in a corner and neither 
side wants to retreat. 
 
5.  (C)  The Armenians recently realigned the main road 
between Noyembrian and Idjevan.  The new route takes inter- 
city traffic out of range of Azeri positions.  (The road 
had come under Azeri fire periodically over the past year.) 
Kasprzyk theorized that the Azeri side believed its 
leverage had been reduced by the road realignment, and 
decided to regain its leverage by moving closer to the 
Armenian pumping station.  (Note:  Kasprzyk did not know 
whether the station was in Armenia or Azerbaijan, but said 
that it is located between the lines that had been 
maintained by the two armies.)  The workers manning the 
pumping station had fled when the Azeris moved closer, and 
the Armenians were unwilling to lose the water supply for 
five villages. 
 
6.  (C)  Ambassador spoke to Deputy Foreign Minister 
Shugarian, and passed on the points provided reftel.  He 
emphasized that the situation was tense and fraught with 
danger of escalation.  The U.S. expected that both sides 
would refrain from taking any actions that would exacerbate 
the situation, and especially refrain from any further 
firing.  Shugarian said he would get in touch with the MOD 
and President\'s Office to pass on the message. 
 
7.  (C)  French Ambassador Cuny telephoned the Ambassador 
to say that Paris was also very worried about the 
situation, and offered to join in a co-chairs demarche to 
the Armenian side.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) The last-minute decision by the Turkish delegation 
not to attend a conference on regional archaeological and 
tourism issues, a report in the Armenian press regarding 
visa regimes and a widely circulated transcript of a Turkish 
newscast hurled the issue of Turkey-Armenia relations back 
into the public spotlight June 15-16.  The public reaction 
by Armenian politicians and legislators was relatively 
quiet.  Armenian MFA contacts, however, suggested that they 
expected an increase in rumors and public debate on the 
issue in advance of the NATO Summit in Istanbul.  End 
summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
GYUMRI-KARS SYMPOSIUM CONTINUES WITHOUT TURKS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Despite the last-minute decision of Turkish 
participants not to attend the event, the Gyumri-Kars 
Historic Preservation and Cultural Tourism Symposium was 
held in Gyumri June 15-16.  Organizers originally planned 
the event as a week-long meeting co-hosted in the 
communities of Gyumri, Armenia and Kars, Turkey to explore 
issues of preservation and tourism as they affect local 
economic development.  The symposium was scaled back the 
prior week due to the failure of the Turkish organizers to 
obtain \"government permission to participate in and co-host 
the event.\"  Armenian MFA representatives, originally 
scheduled as part of the seminar, declined to attend the 
event following the announcement by Turkish organizers. 
U.S. Ambassador John Ordway opened the session and was 
joined by representatives of other diplomatic missions 
accredited to Armenia.  USAID financed portions of the event 
through implementing partner the Academy for Educational 
Development (AED).  Local media reports of the event made 
reference to the absence of the Turkish side but stopped 
short of criticizing the GOT decision or casting the seminar 
as politically charged. 
 
4. (SBU) The Armenian organizers told the Embassy that they 
still plan to travel to Kars in mid-July as tourists to 
complete portions of the originally planned program.  Their 
research trip will focus on archaeological preservation 
issues and applications for regional tourism.  (Note:  The 
region was part of the Russian Empire in the nineteenth 
century.  Archaeologists point to Kars and Gyumri as prime 
examples of strikingly similar architecture and urban 
landscapes from the period that are relatively well 
preserved and have promising applications in the tourism 
sector.  End note). 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
NEWSPAPER REPORT ON TURKISH VISAS PANICS MFA, TRAVELLERS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
5. (SBU) There was considerable speculation around Yerevan 
June 16 following a newspaper report in local daily Haykakan 
Zhamanak claiming that the GOT had modified visa procedures 
for Armenians.  According to the article, the GOT would no 
longer issue visas to Armenians at the airport in Istanbul 
nor at the Georgia-Turkey border.  The article suggested 
that the GOT was making the move in retaliation for 
statements made in the U.S. Congress regarding Turkey\'s role 
in the events of 1915.  Post checked-in early June 16 with 
the Armenian MFA, which was understandably worried about the 
report and totally unaware of such a change.  The MFA 
initiated a call to contacts in Ankara on the issue mid-day. 
The MFA\'s Turkey Desk Officer reported to us late June 16 
that her counterpart in Ankara denied that the MFA had ever 
made such a statement.  The MFA released a statement to the 
press the evening of June 16 (carried by a majority of news 
outlets that evening and the next day) stating that there 
has been no change in procedures for Armenians getting visas 
at Istanbul airport or at the Georgia/Turkey border. 
 
6. (SBU) Post contacts at Yerevan\'s Zvartnots Airport report 
that the Yerevan-Istanbul charter flight and Armavia flight 
left for Turkey June 16 per normal procedures and loaded 
with Armenian passengers hoping to secure a visa at the 
Istanbul airport.  While contacts at the airport reported 
that they were spooked by the June 16 newspaper article, 
they said that the airline or airport had not been 
instructed to date to modify their normal procedures for 
Armenians traveling to Turkey. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
NTV TRANSCRIPT INCITES SPECULATION AMONG POLICYMAKERS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7. (SBU) An unofficial translation of a June 16 Turkish NTV- 
MSNBC television report suggesting that the GOT was making 
preparations to open a border checkpoint connecting Turkey 
and Armenia inspired a flurry of working-level consultations 
within Armenia\'s MFA in Ankara June 17.  According to the 
article, the Turkish MFA had instructed government agencies 
to prepare the Akyaka checkpoint for eventual opening prior 
to the NATO summit in Istanbul.  The Armenian MFA was 
reportedly verifying the information with counterparts in 
Ankara on June 17 while at the same time fending off calls 
from local NGOs and reporters looking for a GOAM statement 
on the issue. 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) The recent buzz around Yerevan regarding Armenia- 
Turkish relations and the series of media reports are 
reminiscent of the surge in speculation that occurred during 
the Summer of 2003.  One important difference, however, is 
the effort of local media and analysts to link the timing of 
these developments or rumored developments to a particular 
event -- the upcoming Istanbul summit.  It appears likely 
that the trend towards speculation will continue as the 
Istanbul meeting approaches.  The extent to which increased 
bureaucratic level GOAM-GOT contact will advance their 
bilateral agenda or merely annoy the two parties remains to 
be seen.  End comment.

SUBJECT: OPPOSITION ANNOUNCES END TO \"HOT SPRING\" 
CAMPAIGN AT LACKLUSTER RALLY 
 
1.  (U) Sensitive But Unclassified -- Please treat 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Leaders of the Armenian opposition Justice 
bloc and National Accord Party officially announced 
June 16 the end of the much-touted \"hot spring\" anti- 
Kocharian campaign.  While some opposition leaders 
hinted during their \"final rally--for now\" on June 16 
that they remain uncompromising in their demand for 
Kocharian\'s resignation, most observers and sources 
within the opposition agree that the announcement was 
an admission of defeat.  It remains unclear from 
opposition statements whether or not opposition MPs 
(who have been boycotting parliament since March 2004) 
will return to parliament now that the rallies appear 
to have lost steam.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
OPPOSITION ENDS ITS SPRING CAMPAIGN 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) During a lackluster June 16 rally, Justice bloc 
leaders announced that they would halt their \"hot 
spring\" anti-Kocharian campaign indefinitely.  Without 
much elaboration, they said that the \"first stage\" of 
their plan to oust Kocharian had not gone as planned 
and that they would think of \"new methods of political 
struggle\" for the future.  National Accord Party 
Chairman Artashes Geghamian added that the decision to 
halt opposition efforts took into consideration several 
\"external factors\" including developments in the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the release of an 
upcoming Council of Europe report on Armenia.  In 
contrast to their earlier statements on the 
opposition\'s resolve to continue its boycott of 
parliament, opposition leaders\' speeches were non- 
committal on the issue during the June 16 rally. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
CITY PRE-APPROVES RALLY, RECEIVES UNEXPECTED REACTION 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
4. (SBU) Unlike most of the previous opposition rallies 
in downtown Yerevan this spring, the mayor\'s office 
approved the June 16 event as part of new regulations 
on political rallies and manifestations.  Opposition 
leaders, some of whom were the sharpest critics of the 
city\'s unwillingness to sanction earlier rallies, 
decried the Mayor\'s move as \"insulting\" and designed to 
put Kocharian and the GOAM in a more democratic, 
benevolent light and to defuse anti-Kocharian sentiment 
among opposition supporters.  One opposition newspaper 
opined that the rally\'s approval was timed closely to 
coincide with the visit of a Council of Europe fact- 
finding team. 
 
5. (SBU) Attendance at the June 16 rally was limited. 
Generous estimates put the number of protesters at 
2000.  Observers reported that the majority of 
attendees left the rally even before the culminating 
speech by People\'s Party Chairman Stepan Demirchian. 
(Note:  Some opposition members reported frustration 
that a televised soccer match was heavy competition for 
the event and drew the crowd away before Demirchian 
could take the podium.  End note.) 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) While the new opposition alliance between 
Demirchian and Geghamian lasted through the spring 
series of rallies and protests, there is little 
evidence to suggest that they plan future collaboration 
on party platforms or as part of a unified front within 
parliament.  The decision of opposition MPs to return 
to parliament will be an important barometer of 
cohesion among opposition parties.  Geghamian has 
utilized his place in parliament to enhance his public 
profile in the past.  Now that opposition rallies have 
lost steam and faded from the front pages, it is 
possible that he, or other opposition MPs, will move 
back into parliament to keep their parties in the 
public eye.  End comment.

CONFERENCE OF AMBASSADOR JOHN ORDWAY 
 
1.  SUMMARY: All mass media widely covered Ambassador 
John Ordway\'s press conference held on June 17.  Almost 
all TV and newspaper reports were accurate and factual. 
The majority of the newspapers quoted the Ambassador 
without any comments.  All the newspapers noted that 
there will be the final press conference before the 
Ambassador\'s departure to Kazakhstan, so the 
journalists expect a kind of wrap up of the 
Ambassador\'s activities in Armenia at the last press 
conference.  The main topics discussed this time were 
resolution of the Karabakh conflict, efficiency of the 
Minsk group activities, the internal political 
situation in the country, the upcoming NATO (PfP) 
exercise in Azerbaijan, as well as other issues.  The 
following is a summary of some of the articles. END 
SUMMARY 
 
U.S. DOES NOT SPONSOR POLITICAL PARTIES 
2. Newspaper of the \"Constitutional Right\" Union 
IRAVUNK (06/18) wrote a short report with the 
conclusion: \"Despite his intention not to assess 
Armenia\'s internal political situation, the Ambassador 
said that they are glad that the recent rallies were 
peaceful and only a few people were detained for their 
political views.\" 
 
U.S. IS STRONGLY AGAINST RESOLUTION BY FORCE. IT WILL 
SUPPORT PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT 
 
3. Pro-governmental HAYOTS ASHKHAR (06/18) gave a 
balanced coverage of the press conference.  \"The 
Ambassador was asked whether the U.S. supports step-by- 
step or package resolution of the Karabakh conflict. 
The Ambassador\'s answer was more than diplomatic and a 
little bit unexpected for those who wanted to hear that 
the only way to resolve the conflict is the package 
approach.  The Ambassador said that they would support 
any version, which would allow the parties to reach an 
agreement and establish lasting peace and stability in 
the region.\" 
 
ORDWAY\'S NEXT TO LAST PRESS CONFERENCE 
 
4. Oppositionist Armenian daily HAYKAKAN ZHAMANAK 
(06/18) started its article with humor regarding 
Ambassador Ordway\'s departure to Kazakhstan.  \"Now 
nothing threatens the departure of Ambassador Ordway to 
Kazakhstan, since during yesterday\'s press conference 
the Ambassador did not make any predictions regarding 
the presidential election in the United Stares, as it 
could have deprived him of his diplomatic status.\" 
 
ORDWAY DOES NOT HURRY TO SUM UP 
 
5. Russian language independent newspaper NOVOYE VREMYA 
(06/19) published an article discussing the recent 
press conferences and different statements made by 
Ambassador Ordway.  \"The monthly press conferences by 
John Ordway, in spite of their protocol character, give 
reason to assume that the Ambassador is deeply familiar 
with the different processes taking place in our 
country.  His balanced and adequate assessments witness 
that the Ambassador wants to leave good memories after 
him.  At least he has not made the kind of statements 
for which the British Ambassador became `famous.\' 
Ordway likewise avoided bows addressed to either the 
authorities or the opposition.\"

1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) President Kocharian signed a decree June 1, 
stating the GOAM\'s intent to free five million dollars 
from the GOAM budget over the next two years for 
refugee housing assistance and authorizing the 
Department of Refugees and Migration (DRM) to seek an 
additional thirteen million in funding from 
international donors. The decree does not allocate 
money from specific accounts in the budget, but only 
declares the GOAM\'s intent to find it.  Embassy 
contacts from the international donor community 
expressed some skepticism regarding the initiative\'s 
intent and eventual effectiveness.  The decree and 
reaction illustrate an uneasy relationship between DRM 
and many international donors.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
DECREE AND IMPLEMENTATION 
------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) President Kocharian signed a decree June 1, 
stating the GOAM\'s intent to free five million dollars 
from the GOAM budget over the next two years for 
refugee housing assistance and authorizes the 
Department of Refugees and Migration (DRM) to seek an 
additional thirteen million in funding from 
international donors.  The decree does not reallocate 
funds within the budget but states GOAM priorities. The 
GOAM convened an inter-ministerial meeting June 23 to 
explain the program and discuss the ongoing search for 
donors.  The program would be similar to the USAID 
Earthquake Zone Recovery Program, which has proven an 
effective method to house an estimated 7,000 families 
who were victims of the 1988 earthquake in northern 
Armenia.  Both the USAID and the proposed DRM plan 
would distribute assistance through the issuance of 
housing purchase certificates. 
 
----------------- 
DONOR REACTIONS 
----------------- 
 
4. (SBU) A USAID officer who attended the meeting was 
skeptical about the viability of the proposed program. 
The absence of adequate oversight of the program and a 
lack of real estate market information were among the 
officer\'s noted concerns.  The representative of the 
Norwegian Refugee Council also expressed skepticism, 
saying the program does not address the difference in 
housing costs between Yerevan and the rest of Armenia. 
According to the office of Population, Refugee, and 
Migration, 42 percent of Armenian refugees live in the 
Yerevan area, and the Norwegian Refugee Council 
representative noted the exceptional difficulty in 
finding them adequate, affordable housing in the 
Yerevan area, where many of them are employed. 
 
5. (SBU) United Nations Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) Representative Peter Nicolaus reacted strongly 
to the initiative, saying he believed that DRM proposed 
the decree specifically to ensure its survival as a 
bureaucratic entity.  According to Nicolaus, 
international donations for refugee housing make-up the 
lion\'s share of DRM\'s budget.  He was particularly 
frustrated that the initiative might thwart UNHCR\'s 
strategy to end its humanitarian refugee assistance 
programs in Armenia.  He explained that UNHCR in 
Armenia intends to pass its remaining humanitarian 
funding to the United Nations Development Program to 
administer through its local economic development 
efforts.  He feared that DRM would insist on separating 
refugee assistance from other development efforts, 
keeping UNHCR in its current role as humanitarian 
donor. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) As illustrated by their reactions, 
international donor organizations remain skeptical 
towards DRM and its efforts to aid Armenia\'s refugees. 
GOAM officials in the past have reportedly inflated 
refugee numbers in order to amplify Armenia\'s refugee 
burden relative to Azerbaijan in the aftermath of the 
Nagorno-Karabagh conflict.

EUROPE SPEECH 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please treat 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Local media reaction was mostly positive in Yerevan 
following President Robert Kocharian\'s June 24 address to 
the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). 
The address, which was covered widely by all local media 
outlets, inspired a flurry of formal and informal commentary 
among GOAM representatives, analysts and international 
missions.  Kocharian supporters within the GOAM were 
enthusiastic about the speech and told Post that it was a 
\"triumph\" in response to the opposition\'s recent criticism 
of Kocharian at PACE.  As expected, Armenian opposition 
leaders sharply criticized the speech, particularly 
Kocharian\'s description of the GOAM\'s response to recent 
opposition activity.  Supporters and critics alike, however, 
reacted positively to Kocharian\'s comments regarding Nagorno- 
Karabakh and the uncharacteristically nostalgic tone of his 
speech.  End summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
PRESS REPORTS GENERALLY POSITIVE 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) After considerable speculation in editorial pages 
the preceding week, local media response to Kocharian\'s June 
24 speech was generally positive.  Two days before the 
speech, Yerevan daily \"Haykakan Zhamanak\" coyly predicted 
that Kocharian might falter in Strasbourg when faced with 
hostile questions from the Azeri and Turkish delegations. 
Following the speech, however, the same newspaper reported 
that Kocharian gave a strong performance and congratulated 
his ability to \"present Armenia in the best possible light.\" 
For the most part, local media did not draw connections 
between Kocharian\'s speech and the Council of Europe\'s 
resolution on Armenia.  Instead, coverage concentrated on 
Kocharian\'s comments regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict.  Initial press reports interpreted his statements 
as a new approach for Kocharian, signaling a more \"helpful\" 
GOAM posture on the N-K issue. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
GOAM SUPPORTERS APPLAUD KOCHARIAN\'S \"FORCEFUL DELIVERY\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4. (SBU) Kocharian supporters within the GOAM were 
enthusiastic about the speech and told Post that it was a 
\"triumphant\" response to the opposition\'s recent criticism 
of Kocharian at PACE.  MFA contacts told us they were 
pleasantly surprised by his forceful delivery and were 
hopeful that it would counteract any negative impressions of 
the GOAM resulting from opposition parliamentarians\' March- 
April speeches.  The speech appeared to exceed the 
expectations of some within the GOAM who earlier predicted 
Kocharian might use the opportunity to aggressively 
discredit the opposition during his address. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
CRITICISM FROM OPPOSITION BUT POSITIVE TAKE ON N-K COMMENTS 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5. (SBU) While not overly negative, opposition leaders were 
quick to criticize Kocharian\'s speech.  Speaking from 
Strasbourg, National Accord Party Chairman Artashes 
Geghamian classified Kocharian\'s analysis of domestic 
political developments in Armenia as \"distorted.\" 
Opposition Justice Bloc leader Stepan Demirchian told us he 
was annoyed by Kocharian\'s defense of the GOAM\'s response to 
the opposition rally of April 12-13 and predicted that these 
comments would later hurt the President.  National 
Democratic Union Chairman Vazgen Manukian described 
Kocharian\'s address as \"mediocre\" and said it was 
confirmation that Kocharian would never be able to rise 
above his perceived \"role as a battalion commander.\" 
Geghamian and others within the opposition, however, reacted 
favorably to Kocharian\'s comments on the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict.  Geghamian congratulated Kocharian for making 
specific mention of the Paris and Key West principles.  He 
added, however, that Kocharian\'s commitment to the issue 
would be better perceived were he to make similar comments 
in Yerevan rather than in Strasbourg.    The issue of a 
joint opposition statement in response to Kocharian\'s 
address is reportedly first on the June 30 agenda of a 
meeting of the leaders of the Justice Bloc and The National 
Accord Party. 
COMMENT 
6. (SBU) While still early, Kocharian\'s speech was not 
initially the lightning rod for local criticism many 
observers had predicted.  Local media coverage of the 
speech, together with unexpectedly positive reactions by 
opposition leaders in response to Kocharian\'s N-K comments, 
have clearly provided a boost of confidence for his 
supporters.  In contrast to his traditionally restrained 
public posture, Kocharian\'s personal tone during the 
question and answer period appears to have struck a 
nostalgic chord -- at least for now -- with a number of 
Armenians across party lines.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU)  An IMF conditionality and commitments to other 
donors, including the United States (as part of the USATF 
action plan), oblige the Government of Armenia to eliminate 
by July 31 ArmEnergo, a state-owned enterprise that is the 
single buyer of midstream electricity. Once ArmEnergo is 
eliminated, the electricity distribution company, 
Electricity Networks of Armenia (ElNetArm), must negotiate 
contracts with all of Armenia\'s generating enterprises, as 
well as the calculating center, national traffic management 
and high-voltage power networks.  Because the Public 
Services Regulatory Commission has not yet established 
market rules for the energy sector or adopted an energy 
adjustment clause, premature dissolution of ArmEnergo would 
put private energy companies in an untenable situation. 
Sources close to the Ministry of Energy say that, despite 
press reports to the contrary, ArmEnergo will necessarily 
exist until there is a viable alternative in place, almost 
certainly past the July 31 deadline.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
ARMENERGO: GUARANTOR OF THE ARMENIAN ENERGY SECTOR 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (SBU) Since privatization of its electrical distribution 
function, ArmEnergo has acted as a single-buyer single- 
seller mediator of electricity, in effect making the 
Government of Armenia the guarantor of the Armenian energy 
sector.  The Ministry of Energy has used adjustments in the 
profits of ArmEnergo to keep end-use prices stable when 
generation costs have fluctuated.  Due to lack of 
transparency in its operations, it has also been subject to 
political interference and funds diversion.  The Government 
of Armenia committed to the IMF to dissolve ArmEnergo by 
July 2004.  The commitment also appears in the May 2004 U.S. 
Armenia Task Force Draft Action Plan. 
 
--------------------- 
THE BUCK STOPS WHERE? 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) It remains unclear what system will replace 
ArmEnergo.  Armenia has committed to a system whereby the 
privately owned electricity distributor, Electricity 
Networks of Armenia (ElNetArm) independently negotiates 
contracts with Armenia\'s generating enterprises as well as 
the national traffic management.  This does not eliminate a 
single-buyer from the system but rather transfers that 
unenviable role to ElNetArm, who currently must provide 
electricity at a tariff comprising a weighted average of 
supply costs based on a mix of hydro, nuclear and thermal 
generation.  The Public Service Regulatory Commission (PSRC) 
has been reluctant to adopt an energy adjustment clause, 
which would give the distributor the right to raise 
electricity prices for end-users when the average costs from 
generation rise.  Without adjusting its tariff to account 
for a change in the composition of generation, ElNetArm 
loses USD 4 million each month that the Armenia Nuclear 
Power Plant does not operate.  (Note: The ANPP shuts down 
annually for maintenance and refueling.  Longer closures due 
to lack of fuel have also occurred in the past.  End note.) 
ArmEnergo is also vulnerable to significant drops in cheap 
hydroelectric production during an unusually dry year. 
Without an adjustment clause and without rules that control 
ElNetArm\'s energy costs, ElNetArm would operate in the red 
and quickly use its cash reserves in the (not unlikely) 
event that generation costs exceed the tariff.  In the worst- 
case scenario, ElNetArm would buy and distribute only that 
electricity it could purchase for less than the tariff, an 
understandable but undesirable outcome that would lead 
immediately to power outages and would be potentially very 
damaging to the government.  (Note: Armenian consumers can 
currently count on reliable power supplies throughout the 
country.  Almost all power interruptions are brief and 
caused by short-term technical problems.  End note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
PSRC RESISTING THE ADOPTION OF MARKET-BASED REGULATION 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The PSRC has argued to preserve ArmEnergo for now 
and has resisted the adoption of rules governing tariff 
adjustment.  The PRSC has also resisted putting market rules 
governing these transactions into a regulatory framework, 
instead preferring to include rules in independent licenses 
and contracts.  Dispatch, import and export rules, which 
govern the seasonal swap with Iran and export to Georgia 
among other things, would affect ElNetArm\'s bottom line 
following the dissolution of ArmEnergo, and would affect end- 
user electricity costs if ElNetArm had an adjustment clause. 
Comment: Hiding such rules in a web of contracts and 
licenses creates a weak base on which a private network of 
generators, distributors, and customers cannot reasonably 
rely.  End Comment. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) The PSRC\'s actions indicate a desire to leave the 
government as the guarantor of both steady supply and steady 
prices in the energy sector.  The government seemingly finds 
the continued existence of ArmEnergo to be the most 
convenient way to do so, as it allows the government to 
absorb energy sector profits as well as losses (although 
there is justified suspicion that profits are diverted 
before reaching the government\'s coffers--another possible 
factor in the reluctance to eliminate ArmEnergo).  Until the 
government is committed to establishing market relations 
between the private players in the energy sector that may 
result in price rises, the elimination of ArmEnergo alone 
could cause more harm than good.  The establishment of rules 
by contract and license rather than law will lend itself to 
abuse, non-transparency, and distorted incentives.  In the 
absence of ArmEnergo, the lack of rules and of an adjustment 
clause would put private energy firms, especially ElNetArm, 
in an untenable situation, and could give private companies 
an incentive to produce, buy or distribute too little 
electricity.

1. (SBU) In eleventh-hour negotiations to reach an agreement 
in the Armentel dispute, Minister of Justice David 
Harutiunian agreed to put off the June 30 deadline for

extension, the government\'s threat still stands: If the 
sides do not reach agreement by September 28, the Ministry 
of Transport and Communication (MOTC) intends to 
unilaterally replace Armentel\'s monopoly license with a more 
restricted concession allowing competing service suppliers 
to provide mobile and international data transmission 
services.  Vahe Yacoubian, Amcit special advisor to the 
Minister, told us that the government had made progress in 
the negotiations, and was confident that Armentel will 
acquiesce to its demand for the introduction of a second GSM 
service provider.  The government believes that competition 
will end the poor service and high cost in 
telecommunications that burden consumers and the Armenian 
economy.  END SUMMARY

2.  (SBU) Whether by mutual agreement or by unilateral 
action, the Armenian government intends to end Armentel\'s 
monopoly in the provision of GSM mobile services and 
international data transmission.  According to Gevorg 
Gvorgyan, Head of Telecommunications Department at the MOTC, 
the Government is seeking a settlement with Armentel that 
permits other service suppliers to provide public mobile 
services (including cellular telephone service, paging 
personal communication services, specialized mobile radio, 
GSM and mobile satellite services) as well as local and 
international data transmission including international 
upload and download services.  Yacoubian believes that 
settlement is possible because Armentel management has 
agreed in principle to a second license for GSM services, 
with Armentel and the Government splitting the proceeds from 
the tender.  In an effort to \"facilitate the negotiations\", 
Yacoubian moved the deadline for agreement to September 28, 
2004.  If Armentel and the government have not reached 
agreement by then, Yacoubian said that the government will 
immediately amend Armentel\'s license to provide for 
competition in GSM and data transmission services and will 
promptly offer licenses to competing service suppliers. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
ARBITRATION TO CONTINUE CONCURRENTLY WITH NEGOTIATION 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3. (SBU) While Yacoubian said that a settlement is 
preferable to ongoing arbitration (probably followed by 
litigation in Armenian courts), both sides are nevertheless 
pursuing their case scheduled for September 6 before a 
London arbitration panel.  Yacoubian expects that the sides 
will complete arbitration, but will ask the arbitrator to 
withhold the decision if the sides reach an agreement. 
Comment:  The extension of the settlement deadline to a date 
after the arbitration increases the likelihood of a workable 
settlement and, in the other event, provides the basis for 
more informed unilateral action by the government. 
Yacoubian commented that the government intends to seek 
Armentel\'s comments on the amended license and the draft 
Telecommunications Law, which had been prepared without 
input from Armentel due to the dispute.  Armentel\'s 
acceptance of the outcome is critical to a successful 
market, as ultimately Armentel will have the dominant market 
position and will maintain control of the non-liberalized 
communications infrastructure.  Any additional mobile 
license would require Armentel\'s cooperation for interchange 
with fixed line and mobile subscribers.  The arbitration 
process will also likely give the government an idea of the 
scope of damages they may face for unilaterally depriving 
Armentel of its monopoly license.  Yacoubian had earlier 
told the Ambassador that the government intends to offer 
Armentel the proceeds of the sale of a new mobile service 
license to Armentel as compensation.  He again confirmed the 
GOAM\'s intention to do this, and added that part of the 
OTE\'s opening negotiating approach was to ask \"how much\" of 
the license sale\'s proceeds the GOAM was prepared to provide 
in compensation.  End Comment 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
GOAM NOT PREPARED TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL LICENSES 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4.  (SBU) Even were the government to amend Armentel\'s 
monopoly license on July 1, the regulatory framework is not 
yet ready for a competitive telecommunications market.  To 
suspend Armentel\'s exclusive license is not the same thing 
as issuing new licenses to competing service providers. 
Asked whether changing the license is legally sufficient to 
permit a tender offer or the solicitation of licenses by 
would-be Internet service providers, Gvorgyan replied, \"In 
theory, yes\".  Armenia\'s General Agreement on Trade in 
Services (GATS) schedule contains a specific commitment to 
provide \"unlimited market access for any and all basic and 
value-added telecom services subsector initially covered by 
the monopoly immediately upon suspension or termination of 
monopoly rights....\"  In fact, many other conditions have to 
be met.  Armentel is principally regulated not by law but by 
its license.  To issue new licenses in a liberalized market 
the MOTC would have to establish a regulatory framework 
allowing for multiple service providers, as well as some 
competition safeguards to prevent Armentel from abusing its 
dominant position when competing in liberalized sectors. 
Gvorgyan claims that the MOTC is not ready to regulate a 
liberalized market in telecommunications and data 
transmission until licensing procedures are established and 
the draft Law on Electronic Communication passes. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
GOAM NEGOTIATING WITH WOULD-BE MOBILE SERVICE PROVIDERS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Yacoubian conceded that it was still unclear how a 
new mobile telephony license would be issued.  Yacoubian 
said that ideally, there would be a public tender, but if 
there was not enough interest he said that the government 
would \"have a beauty contest\" and pick the best candidate. 
The MOTC\'s Director of International Relations, Gagik 
Grigoryan said that \"many\" service providers had already 
approached the Ministry about providing service, and that 
the Ministry was engaging in \"preliminary negotiations\". 
When asked directly he confirmed information from another 
source that a Russian telecommunications company Zont 
Holding has been negotiating with the Ministry about bidding 
on a mobile telephony license.  When asked if an interested 
company should wait for a public tender offer or if they 
could approach the Ministry directly, Gvorgyan suggested 
that they approach him at the Ministry any time.  Asked 
whether a tender would be only for GSM or would allow for 
open standards, Gvorgyan replied that the government had not 
yet made a decision but that he suspected they would \"follow 
Western Europe.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO MOVE FROM MINISTRY TO COMMISSION 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
6.  (SBU) The draft Law on Telecommunication will deprive 
the MOTC of the authority to regulate in the 
telecommunications sector, and will endow the Public 
Services Regulatory Commission for (PSRC) with that power. 
(Note: the law has passed its first reading, and will likely 
pass in September.  End Note.)  Gvorgyan added that at that 
point the Ministry will cease to issue licenses and will 
become strictly a policy-making body.  The PSRC, which 
currently regulates water and electricity distribution, will 
undertake to set the legal and regulatory framework for 
telecommunications licensing and will implement competition 
and universal service safeguards.  (Note: USAID\'s Commercial 
Law and Economic Reform Program is currently giving 
technical assistance to the PSRC.  End Note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
CURRENT TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM STYMIES GROWTH 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (SBU) Armenian businesses (and the general public) 
complain that the high cost and poor service of 
telecommunications service stymie growth in Armenia, 
especially in the emerging IT sector.  Armenia\'s IT 
comprises more than 100 firms employing 3,500 people and 
generating US 50 million in annual revenue.  Because nearly 
all these firms are cost centers for foreign IT development 
companies, reliable and inexpensive international 
communications are essential to the competitiveness of the 
industry.  While large companies have been able to establish 
their own satellite link with their home offices, industry 
managers consistently cite the dependence on Armentel as the 
greatest impediment to growth in the industry as a whole. 
 
------------------------------ 
BACKGROUND ON ARMENTEL DISPUTE 
------------------------------ 
 
8. (U) In March 1998, Greek telecommunications company OTE 
invested USD 142.5 million for a 90 percent equity stake in 
Armentel, giving it the exclusive right to provide all 
telecommunications services in Armenia, including exclusive 
public fixed switched technology, mobile telephony, 
broadband, Internet and directory services until 2013.  In 
return, OTE agreed to support Armentel in developing and 
expanding the telecommunications infrastructure in Armenia, 
including digitizing the public switched telephone network 
and providing for mobile GSM coverage throughout the 
territory of Armenia. 
 
9. (U) In February 2000, the Republic of Armenia filed a 
petition for arbitration with the International Court of 
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce 
alleging the non-fulfillment of OTE\'s investment obligations 
as prescribed in Armentel\'s share purchase agreement.  OTE 
had an obligation to invest at least USD 100 million before 
March 2000.  The Government of Armenia eventually walked 
away from this initial claim and the parties reached an 
agreement that OTE would invest a further USD 65 million. 
OTE claims that it has invested USD 200 million in Armentel 
up to March 2003.  The Government of Armenia claims that 
this number is grossly inflated and refuses to recognize 
much of the claimed investment. 
 
10. (U) In May 2003 the Ministry of Transport and 
Communication again initiated a claim that investment that 
OTE and Armentel had failed to meet their investment 
commitments--specifically not achieving the prescribed 
teledensity requirements, the investment program, Internet 
and data transmission upgrades, and for not meeting the 
mobile telephony coverage commitments on time.  OTE 
counterclaimed, and Armentel commenced separate ICC 
arbitration proceedings against the GOAM, arguing that OTE 
and Armentel have suffered losses because the GOAM prevented 
Armentel from exercising its exclusive rights and from 
charging call-rates as provided for in the license.  Both 
cases are currently pending before the Arbitration panel in 
London. 
 
11. (U) Since 2002, Armentel has been financing its 
investment plan exclusively from operating revenues, without 
support from OTE.  Armentel\'s operating revenues for the 
first quarter of 2004 amounted to Euro 17.6 million, while 
net income for the quarter was Euro 2.4 million, while the 
number of mobile customers is up 58.7 percent to 131,237. 
Armentel mobile service is vastly oversubscribed.  New SIM 
cards are not available; black market SIM cards sell for up 
to USD 300.  The service for those who do have SIM cards is 
poor and unreliable.  OTE\'s quarterly report states that OTE 
will not fund any further capital requirements in Armentel 
and is trying to exit the Armenian market. 
 
---------- 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
 
12. (SBU) The current state of the telecommunications system 
in Armenia is unsatisfactory.  Poor service and high cost 
stymie growth and burden consumers.  For three years 
Armenia\'s monopoly telecommunications provider and the 
government have been locked in a stalemate where the service 
supplier refuses to invest more in infrastructure because it 
intends to exit the market and the government threatens to 
deprive it of its monopoly.  Now the government looks set to 
liberalize important telecommunications subsectors, 
specifically public mobile communications and international 
data transmission. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13. (SBU) While any competition will likely improve service 
and reduce prices to consumers, it is incumbent on Armenia 
to liberalize the sector in a way that will generate true 
competition and will comply with Armenia\'s WTO obligations. 
It is not clear that Armenia is off to a good start. 
Premature negotiating with would-be service providers 
suggests that the GOAM may not intend to have a transparent 
and non-discriminatory tender for new service supplier 
licenses, but rather cut a back-room deal before an official 
tender is announced.  Yacoubian, however, made clear that he 
understands the damage a non-transparent, self-serving 
process would do.  It is also not clear when the government 
will transfer regulatory authority to the PSRC.  Gvorgyan 
claims that the Ministry is keen to transfer its regulatory 
power, and that it will be complete in September.  Our USAID 
contractor claims that the Ministry has tacitly fought the 
transfer as well as the Armentel license change because 
certain officials have a cozy and profitable relationship 
with Armentel, although we cannot independently confirm this 
allegation.  Sources close to the Commission suggest that 
the PSRC is in any case ill-equipped to provide transparent 
and non-discriminatory regulation of the liberalized market 
while preventing abuse of position by Armentel and 
maintaining universal service guarantees.

-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
2. (SBU) Despite Armenia\'s geographic isolation and 
closed borders, trade with its southern neighbor Iran 
remains surprisingly small.  While the April 12-13 
meeting between Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan 
Oskanyan and Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi 
and First Vice-President Mohammad Reza Aref focused on 
the proposed Iran-Armenian gas pipeline (reftel), new 
trade or investment agreements were noticeably absent 
from the meeting\'s agenda. The overall trade turnover 
of USD 100 million between Iran and Armenia has 
remained steady over the past six years with Armenian 
exports to Iran slowly decreasing and Iranian imports 
remaining steady.  A combination of an increase in the 
import of more western goods, an increase in Armenian 
domestic production, and obstacles to doing business in 
Iran will likely push down the overall trade balance 
between Iran and Armenia in the near future. End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
ARMENIAN EXPORTS TO IRAN: SMALL AND SHRINKING 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Recent statistics provided by the GOAM show 
that the total value of exports from Armenia to Iran 
during 2003 was USD 22.2 million (a decrease from USD 
31.3 million during the same period in 2002).  This 
latest information places Iran in seventh place for 
Armenian exports behind Russia, Belgium, Israel, U.S. 
and Switzerland. 
 
4. (SBU) Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Middle 
East Division Chief Karen Mirzoyan and Ministry of 
Trade and Economic Development representative Gagik 
Kocharian said that the main Armenian exports to Iran 
are machinery and machine parts, copper, aluminum, 
scrap metals and a minimal amount of food products. 
Kocharian said the GOAM believed that the amount of 
machines and machine parts exported to Iran would 
probably stay at the same level for the near future, 
but the amount of export of scrap metal to Iran would 
drop.  He predicted this drop because much of the 
leftover Soviet era scrap in Armenia had already been 
sold, and Armenian scrap dealers are now looking toward 
European and Indian clients for better prices. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
IRANIAN BUSINESS PRACTICES FRUSTRATE TRADE 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) Samuel Bakimyan, Chief of the Armenian Chamber 
of Commerce, said that dissonance between Armenian and 
Iranian business practices also frustrated trade 
between the two countries.  He reported that an 
upcoming exhibition for Armenian exports will not 
include Iran.  Bakimyan stated that Armenian 
businessmen find the business climate in Iran 
frustrating and complain of cultural misunderstandings, 
a difficult Iranian bureaucracy and the inability to 
sign and keep agreements with their Iranian partners. 
 
------------------------- 
IRANIAN EXPORTS TO ARMENIA 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Official GOAM statistics show that in 2003, 
Iranian exports to Armenia equaled USD 66.7 million (an 
increase of USD 62 million from the same period in 
2002).  Mirzoyan and Kocharian told us that the main 
imports from Iran consisted of fruits, nuts, light 
metals, textile home products, and plastics.  Kocharian 
predicted that certain imports from Iran will probably 
drop in the next several years due to the increased 
importation of foodstuffs from Europe and recently 
opened plastic and cement factories in Armenia. 
Kocharian believed that home textile products will 
probably remain steady and imported raw materials from 
Iran may actually increase as domestic production in 
Armenia increases.  Kocharian stated that many rank and 
file Armenians, however, had a perception that Iranian 
manufactured goods were of low quality.  GOAM contacts 
report that the increase of domestic goods and European 
imports, coupled with the bias against Iranian goods, 
is slowly pushing many Iranian plastics, foodstuffs and 
manufactured goods out of the Armenian domestic market. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
BUILDING TEXTILES: STEADY IRANIAN IMPORT 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) One consistent attribute in Iranian-Armenian 
trade has been the importation of Iranian building 
materials.  The President of building contractor RV 
Comfort, Ruben Shahmuradyan, told us that from 1994- 
2004, he increased the import of Iranian construction 
and building materials by twenty percent each year.  He 
said that RV imported about USD ten million worth of 
Iranian goods in 2004, making RV the leading importer 
of Iranian construction materials, tiles, bathroom 
appliances, radiators, stones and piping in Armenia. 
Shahmuradyan told us that more than half of his total 
inventory was made up of Iranian products, which he was 
able to consistently sell to local builders because of 
their affordable price.  Shahmuradyan predicted that he 
would increase the import of Iranian goods over the 
next several years and told us that after a multi-year 
relationship with Iranian factory owners, he can now 
buy up to USD 300,000 on credit.  He said that he has 
enjoyed support from both Iranian Customs officials and 
the Iranian Embassy in facilitating the purchase and 
shipping of his products. 
 
----------------------------- 
IRANIAN INVESTMENT IN ARMENIA 
----------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) According to Tigran Sukiasyan of the Ministry 
of Trade and Development, Iran invested USD two hundred 
thousand in Armenia in 2003.  Investment in 2003 
dropped sharply from an unusual spike of over USD two 
million in 2002.  Sukiasyan stated that since 1991, 
Iran ranked eighteenth in total investments in Armenia 
following Russia, U.S., Greece, Cyprus and others.  The 
2003 investment figures put Iran in twentieth place for 
foreign investment in Armenia during the year. 
Mirzoyan told us that Iranian investors generally 
prefer to make smaller investments in Armenia because 
they are still uncertain about the local business 
climate and are often afraid to lose any large 
investment capital.  Kocharian said he believed that 
mid-level Armenian and Iranian businessmen founded the 
majority of recent joint ventures in Armenia.  As an 
example of a successful joint venture between the two 
countries, he pointed to Iran\'s Grand Sun Holding, 
which produces lamps in Iran as well as light 
industrial products, jewelry, and transportation joint 
ventures in Armenia.  A June 2004 visit by Armenia\'s 
Minister of Agriculture reportedly included discussion 
of new joint ventures involving leather goods and fruit 
products. 
 
9. (SBU) In a five-year (1998-2002) Iranian economic 
cooperation program outline, the Iranian government 
admitted that trade did not significantly increase from 
1998 to 2002, and felt this was hampered due to 
misunderstandings on both sides, frequent changes in 
Armenian officials, lack of transparency, and a lack of 
a long term investment strategy.  The outline also 
stated that the energy sector was a crucial area of 
bilateral cooperation because of Iranian interest in 
selling Iranian gas through Armenia and Georgia to 
Europe, as well as the import of electricity from 
Armenia to help develop the Iranian economy (reftel). 
The outline also suggests that Iran was interested in 
actively pursuing joint ventures in cattle breeding, 
poultry, milk processing plants, and leather processing 
mills. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) Even though Iran represents one of only two 
immediate open borders with Armenia, there are few non- 
energy joint ventures or investments currently under 
discussion between the two governments.  While trade in 
certain sectors such as Iranian building materials, 
Iranian fruits, and Armenian machinery and machine 
parts will probably remain steady or even expand in the 
near future, non-energy trade between the two nations 
will likely remain at the same level or even slowly 
shrink, due to cultural misunderstandings, bureaucratic 
obstacles, and a desire of Armenian businessmen to 
explore the more efficient and larger markets in Europe 
and the U.S.

GOAM MCA BOARD MEETINGS CONTINUE 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) GOAM sources tell us that the GOAM MCA Board has 
met a total of seven times to date.  This number, however, 
includes five consultative sessions in which GOAM MCA Board 
members participated as well as internal meetings of the 
Board.  According to the Prime Minister\'s Office, the Board 
will meet at least once per month and will likely convene 
more often in the weeks preceding submission of Armenia\'s 
MCA compact proposal.  MCA Board meetings have not been open 
to the press but have included press availability 
immediately following the session.  In contrast, 
consultative sessions have been open to the press and 
public.  The Prime Minister\'s office invited an Embassy 
representative to attend the next MCA Board meeting. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
CONSULTATIVE PROCESS WILL MOVE TO REGIONS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The Prime Minister and GOAM MCA Board instructed 
the governors of Armenia\'s eleven provinces, who attended 
the most recent GOAM MCA Board meeting in mid-June, to 
sponsor a series of consultative sessions within their 
respective regions within the next month.  GOAM sources told 
us that the instructions included a charge to hold meetings 
in their regions\' poorest, largest and most remote cities 
and towns.  Villages and towns in border areas will receive 
special consideration as venues for these meetings.  The 
Prime Minister reportedly told governors that, in order to 
qualify as bona fide sessions, these meetings must include 
the press, be open to the public, and be properly announced 
in the local media.  The first of these meetings will be 
held during the first two weeks of July.  We plan to attend 
some of these meetings as observers. 
 
------------------------------ 
GOAM MCA STRUCTURES TAKE SHAPE 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) GOAM officials in the office of the Prime Minister 
reported that the GOAM\'s MCA Board, Secretariat and related 
structures have taken shape during the past two weeks 
(reftel).  Sergey Balassanyan, Chair of the Ministry of 
Finance and Economy\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(PRSP) Coordination Division, will head the Secretariat. 
Balassanyan will continue to answer to Deputy Minister of 
Finance and Economy Tigran Khachatryan, who appears to be 
doing the majority of the legwork on MCA issues for the MFE. 
Reportedly in an effort \"to create internal checks and 
balances and distribute everyday responsibilities,\" the 
Economic Affairs Division within the Office of the Prime 
Minister will serve as MCA Board Recorder.  Division Chief 
Simon Ghonaghchyan was eager to show us volumes of notes of 
GOAM MCA Board meetings, consultative sessions and by-laws 
that have been produced to date.  While still available 
neither to the public nor in languages other than Armenian, 
the Prime Minister\'s Office assured us that these materials 
would shortly be available for public use and distributed 
among the international community.  The Embassy has 
requested advance copies of these materials (in particular 
GOAM MCA Board by-laws) and will forward them to MCC 
Washington when available. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
PRESIDENT\'S CHIEF ADVISOR ON WASHINGTON MEETINGS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5. (SBU) Following recent meetings in Washington, President 
Kocharian\'s Chief Economic Advisor and GOAM MCA Board Deputy 
Chairman Vahram Nercissiantz reported to GOAM colleagues 
that the sessions were productive and that he came away from 
meetings with the MCC Board and State Department with new 
ideas regarding the consultative process.  He told 
USAID/Armenia Mission Director (also in Washington) that the 
GOAM might push back its MCA compact proposal submission to 
August.  Nercissiantz has tentative plans to visit 
Washington in late July or early August. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
MORE PREDICTIONS:  RURAL WATER AND ROADS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) In private and public statements, high-ranking GOAM 
officials told us that they predict that the GOAM\'s MCA 
compact proposal will involve improvement for rural water 
access and road rehabilitation.  While mindful that the 
consultative process is far from over, they point to studies 
(including the PRSP and feasibility studies by international 
donor organizations) as strong indicators that these sectors 
will offer the best use for MCA funding.  GOAM officials 
representing the urban areas in and around Yerevan have 
reportedly \"given up hope\" that the GOAM\'s compact proposal 
will include projects in the capital.  We continue to hear 
rumors that municipal leaders in Yerevan are disgruntled by 
what they perceive as an \"unfair concentration on rural 
improvement.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
PRESS REPORTS ON REGIONAL CONSULTS, OSKANIAN MEETINGS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7. (U) Recent press reports regarding MCA concentrated on 
Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian\'s June meetings in 
Washington and reported that USG officials congratulated 
Oskanian regarding Armenia\'s MCA eligibility.  The media 
also included wide coverage of the GOAM\'s plans to take the 
MCA consultative process to the country\'s regions.  A June 
17 RFE/RL report carried by Azbarez on-line (an English- 
language newspaper related to Armenian Revolutionary 
Federation media outlets in Armenia with considerable 
distribution among Diasporan communities and expatriates in 
Yerevan) included statements by Minister of Finance and 
Economy Vartan Khachatryan that only two formal proposals by 
Armenia-based NGOs had been received by the GOAM MCA Board. 
(Note:  GOAM sources later contradicted this report but the 
MFE has not yet released clarification of the statement nor 
an update.  End Note.) 
 
----------------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  GOAM INTEREST IN BEST PRACTICES 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Judging from conversations with GOAM 
representatives at all levels, there is a sense among some 
bureaucrats that the clock is ticking and that the success 
of Armenia\'s compact proposal could depend as much on timing 
as it does on quality.  Post continues to echo the message 
of MCC CEO Applegarth that proposal substance, including the 
consultative process, is key.  As with other foreign policy 
considerations, Armenians are extremely sensitive to where 
they stand in relation to other countries in the MCA 
process.  During discussions about what would constitute a 
successful compact proposal, GOAM contacts within the MFE, 
MFA and Prime Minister\'s Office have expressed interest in 
what, if any, successful practices Washington can share with 
Armenia from other MCA eligible countries.

Yerevan, July 2, 2004 
 
Dear Mr. President, 
 
On behalf of the people of Armenia and my own 
behalf, please accept warmest congratulations on the 
two hundred and twenty-eighth anniversary of the 
independence of the United States of America. 
 
We are grateful for steady partnership and generous 
assistance of the United States in supporting our 
efforts to build a stable, democratic and prosperous 
country.  Another demonstration of such support has 
been acceptance of Armenia in the MCA initiative. 
 
The United States is a home of over one million 
people of Armenian descent, who have been given the 
opportunity to become an integral part of American 
society and make a significant contribution to 
economic, political and cultural life of the United 
States.  They are a source of pride for Armenia and 
a special link between our two countries. 
 
Armenia highly appreciates the role the United 
States plays in our region, greatly contributing to 
the economic development and stability in the South 
Caucasus.  We also highly value the United States\' 
continuous engagement, as the OSCE Minsk Group Co- 
Chair, in the Nagorno Karabagh peace process.  The 
government will continue its unconditional support 
for the US-led campaign to combat international 
terrorism and prevent proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction. 
 
Mr. President, please accept once again my best 
wishes for happiness and continued success to you 
personally and the friendly people of the United 
States. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
/s/ 
 
ROBERT KOCHARIAN

2. (SBU) Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced June 
24 that Iranian President (Ali) Mohammad Khatami-Ardakani 
would visit Armenia this September.  According to the 
announcement, Khatami will be the first Iranian head of 
state to visit Armenia.  GOAM representatives said the visit 
was intended to \"cement friendly relations\" between the 
neighboring countries.  Top on the agenda will be upcoming 
joint projects including the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline (ref 
A), the planned hydroelectric power plant on the Arax River 
and the Kajaran tunnel in Armenia\'s southern Syunik 
province.  This announcement comes on the heels of recent 
visits by GOAM officials to Iran including President 
Kocharian\'s Chief of Staff Artashes Tumanian and Minister of 
Agriculture Davit Lokyan (ref B). 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
3. (SBU) MFA sources tell us that the agenda remains 
tentative.  The GOAM has been careful to portray the 
upcoming meeting as principally economic in nature and has 
downplayed any implications of a major shift in political 
alliances.  Meanwhile, Iranian press reports continue to 
reach Armenia presenting the initiative as a move to enhance 
Iran\'s regional position.  Armenian-Iranian bilateral 
negotiations, however, are usually subject to long delays, 
and the results are frequently more modest than the two 
governments project publicly.

SUBJECT:  GOAM\'S MCA MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTATIVE PROCESS IN 
THE RURAL REGIONS 
 
REF:  YEREVAN 1507 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) Ministry of Finance and Economy officials tell us 
that the consultative process in advance of the GOAM\'s 
upcoming MCA compact proposal submission has moved to the 
country\'s regions and is on schedule.  The GOAM has begun 
compiling a matrix of all concept papers and/or comments 
received from NGOs and international organizations and will 
begin a preliminary review of these documents o/a July 15. 
The MFE is managing the bulk of day-to-day MCA consultative 
operations for the GOAM and continues to link the process 
with the approach during the development of the GOAM\'s 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).  Please note action 
request in paragraph 10.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
PRSP TEAM HEADS-UP GOAM MCA OPERATIONS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) As a follow-up to the Ambassador\'s earlier meeting 
with Minister of Finance Vardan Khachatryan, USAID Mission 
Director and Embassy Assistance Coordinator met with 
Ministry of Finance and Economy Development Department Chief 
Armen Hayrapetyan, PRSP Program Department Chief Sergey 
Balasanyan and PRSP Secretariat Coordinator Hovik Azizyan 
July 9 to discuss MCA issues.  Azizyan confirmed that the 
Ministry of Finance and Economy continues to manage the bulk 
of the GOAM\'s day-to-day operations on MCA in coordination 
with the Prime Minister\'s Economic Department and relevant 
ministries of the GOAM\'s MCA Board.  Azizyan said the GOAM 
would develop an unofficial organizational chart to help the 
USG and donor community better understand the GOAM\'s 
decision-making framework on MCA issues and promised to 
deliver the document within a week.  Post will transmit this 
and other documents via e-mail. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
MCA BOARD COLLECTS CONCEPT PAPERS -- FIRST REVIEW JULY 15 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3. (SBU) Azizyan confirmed information provided to Post 
earlier regarding recent GOAM MCA Board meetings (reftel). 
He said the Board was regularly collecting and informally 
reviewing project concept papers from a number of sources 
(NGOs, educational institutions, international 
organizations).  The Board had developed a matrix of concept 
papers received to date and would continue to accept papers 
from all sources (including from a GOAM internet website, 
government agencies, regional consultations) until 
approximately July 15.  (Note:  See 
www.mfe.am/mfeengweb/hazmart.htm for more details about how 
the GOAM is soliciting input on MCA from the public.  End 
note.)  After this date, the GOAM MCA Board will conduct a 
preliminary review of the proposals and fold viable ideas 
into the GOAM\'s draft compact proposal.  (Comment:  The 
matrix appears to include a number of proposals from NGOs 
that approached the Embassy and/or USAID mission during the 
past month.  Post has no reason to believe that any proposal 
has been rejected outright by the GOAM to date.  End 
Comment.)  Azizyan said the GOAM would continue to accept 
papers following July 15 but was eager to begin processing 
the best concept papers into \"manageable\" portions of the 
GOAM\'s compact proposal. 
 
4. (U) Azizyan briefly previewed the types of proposals 
received to date.  He said that the GOAM was happy to see 
that, for the most part, concept papers followed the 
parameters of the GOAM\'s PRSP.  The vast majority focused on 
job creation in rural areas.  He said that a number of 
concept papers, however, \"missed the mark\" and were weak 
attempts by some groups to tap into MCA funding.  Azizyan 
said that the GOAM MCA Board was nonetheless including these 
concept papers in the formal group to be reviewed beginning 
July 15. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
MEDIA INTEREST WANING - EXPECT UPSWING WITH RURAL MEETINGS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
5. (U) Azizyan agreed that while the majority of these 
proceedings had been open to the press, public interest was 
waning in the media (particularly among newspapers) 
regarding the MCA process itself in the nation\'s capital. 
He and his colleagues confirmed that Armenia\'s state 
television was airing the proceedings of GOAM MCA Board 
meetings each Sunday evening, to a lukewarm reaction by the 
viewing public.  He said that television coverage of the 
first set of consultative sessions in the region, however, 
was widespread and predicted an upswing in national media 
coverage as this process continues. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
GOVERNORS AND PRSP NETWORK HOST MEETINGS IN RURAL AREAS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
6. (U) Azizyan reported that the first set of MCA 
consultative meetings were well underway in Armenia\'s 
regions.  Regional governors, by mandate of the GOAM MCA 
Board, had been hosting open meetings in public places 
throughout their regions over the past two weeks.  Azizyan 
made special note of the fact that governors were instructed 
to host these meetings in locations other than their offices 
in order to encourage open participation and avoid the 
appearance of controlling the proceedings or outcomes.  He 
said that the consultative meetings included both a session 
for open commentary from participants regarding MCA as well 
as a chance to comment on the GOAM\'s early indication that a 
compact proposal would focus on rural infrastructure 
including water, roads, education and health.  The meetings 
reportedly include information on how to submit program 
ideas directly to the GOAM or through regional governors. 
Ministry officials showed us an example of a brochure 
detailing GOAM MCA procedures that governors are 
distributing during the meetings.  In addition to the 
governors\' meetings, Azizyan said that the GOAM had 
activated the network of NGOs involved in the PRSP review 
process.  In some cases this network was hosting additional 
consultative sessions in addition to those organized by 
regional governors. 
 
7. (SBU) According to reports from regional offices and the 
MFE, some regional governors are planning to submit concept 
papers to the GOAM MCA Board as part of the nationwide 
process.  The governor of Armenia\'s southern Syunik province 
told the MFE that his office would submit its proposal in 
advance of the initial July 15 review.  According to 
Azizyan, proposals from governors will be included in the 
general matrix of concept papers but will likely be reviewed 
separately from those submitted by the general public 
(although still in the same format and during public 
meetings). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
CONSULTATIVE SESSION IN DIMAVAN TYPICAL OF RURAL MEETINGS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
8. (U) Hayrapetyan said that a recent consultative meeting 
in the village of Dimavan was typical of the ongoing 
meetings in Armenia\'s regions.  He said that a relatively 
large group of citizens (a few dozen) gathered for the 
meeting together with the regional governor, local media and 
PRSP NGO network representatives.  An MCA Board member and 
PRSP Secretariat representative were also in attendance. 
Hayrapetyan said that the participants came to the meeting 
with little in the way of formal proposals, but asked the 
GOAM to factor in job creation for the local population when 
devising the compact proposal.  He said that the meetings 
often turned into roundtable sessions about an entire series 
of local issues, but that GOAM MCA Board members and others 
guided the discussion to the best extent possible. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
COMMENT:  RURAL PROCESS MOVING FASTER THAN EXPECTED 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
9.(SBU) The consultative process in Armenia\'s rural regions 
has moved along faster than we expected.  The GOAM has 
assured us that Embassy representatives will be invited to 
observe regional consultations within the next few weeks 
which will strengthen our perspective.  In the meantime, the 
consultative process appears to be progressing well.  Its 
influence on the GOAM\'s final compact proposal, however, 
remains to be seen. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
ACTION REQUEST:  SHARING IDEAS AMONG MCA COUNTRY POSTS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
10. (U) Post understands that an MCC Collective is being 
created at the Department for ease in transmitting front- 
channel cables regarding MCA issues.  We look forward to 
utilizing this address once it is authorized by Washington. 
While sharing front channel information is important, Post 
believes that sharing information among posts at MCA 
eligible countries via e-mail exchange would increase the 
flow of ideas.  An MCA e-mail exchange (for use by MCA PoCs 
at Posts, their respective desk officers and MCC 
headquarters at the Department) would allow us to better 
communicate among ourselves as USG parties and share 
relevant information with host governments.  Action request: 
Post requests MCC consider creating an MCA e-mail exchange.

about the possibility that the Cuba resolution would be

voting against it or at a minimum abstaining, but that the 
final decision depended upon updates from EU representatives 
in New York.  He predicted that any split among EU countries 
would \"necessitate\" an abstention from the GOAM.  He said the 
MFA was anxious to convey a \"helpful approach\" on this issue 
to the Department and our mission in New York.

MAJOR DELEGATION EXPECTED FOR FIRST STATE VISIT

1. (SBU) MFA sources confirmed July 20 that Armenian 
President Robert Kocharian would travel to China September 
26-30.  The GOAM had not yet made this information public 
but will likely announce it to the press July 21 or 22. 
Several GOAM Foreign Ministers have traveled to China in the 
past as part of international conferences, but this trip 
will be the GOAM\'s first state visit to China.  Sources 
close to the President\'s office said Kocharian was planning 
to invite up to seven cabinet-level ministers on the trip, 
which would make it the largest GOAM delegation of its kind 
to date.

COMMENT

2. (SBU) If these meetings indeed come together, substantive 
discussion will not likely go beyond the prospects for 
further economic cooperation and policy collaboration in 
international fora.  Kocharian will no doubt attempt to 
portray the trip as evidence of an increased political 
profile vis-a-vis Turkey and Azerbaijan.  Pundits will 
attempt to link the visit with a perceived change in 
Armenia\'s longtime policy of \"complementarity\" between the 
U.S. and Russia.  If nothing else, the trip will add an 
unexpected factor into local political discussion this fall 
which was otherwise poised to center around the opposition\'s 
expected return to parliament and familiar foreign policy 
issues surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and relations with 
Turkey.

-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
2. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche on USG initiatives at 
the 59th UNGA to MFA International Organizations Acting 
Division Chief Artak Apitonian July 20.  Apitonian predicted 
that the GOAM would support the majority of the USG 
initiatives, and was upbeat regarding potential cooperation 
on economic issues and a possible anti-trafficking 
resolution.  He said, however, that the USG should not 
expect a shift in the GOAM\'s approach toward UNGA Middle 
East resolutions this year.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
ADVANCING ECONOMIC FREEDOM 
-------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Apitonian said the GOAM was mostly in agreement 
with the USG\'s approach to economic issues at UNGA.  He said 
that the GOAM looked to the UN to encourage countries to 
focus their domestic policies on the goals of the Monterrey 
Consensus of 2002.  He said that the GOAM shares the same 
vision regarding good governance and economic development in 
the country.  He cited Armenia\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Paper (PRSP), the recent discussions of the U.S.-Armenia 
Task Force on Economic Cooperation (USATF) and the country\'s 
eligibility for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) funding 
as evidence of the GOAM\'s commitment to the principles of 
the Monterrey Consensus and USG economic policy initiatives. 
Apitonian hinted that FM Vartan Oskanian\'s address to the 
UNGA this year would focus on these themes.  He also 
suggested that Armenia\'s Ambassador to the UN, Armen 
Martirosian, was more engaged than his predecessors on 
economic issues and said the USG might find him a more eager 
partner on economic policies. 
 
-------------------------------- 
COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Apitonian said that Armenia would be supportive of 
resolutions addressing the issue of trafficking of persons 
at UNGA.  He indicated that the GOAM was anxious to portray 
itself as an ally in the fight against trafficking in 
persons in the UN and other international arenas as part of 
its ongoing work with the USG on the issue.  Apitonian noted 
that Armenia defines a minor as anyone under the age of 18. 
He said that Armenia\'s ambition to join the UN Commission on 
Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and would enhance its 
international efforts in trafficking in persons and hinted 
that the GOAM would approach the USG for its support in 
2005. 
 
-------------------- 
PROMOTING DEMOCRACY 
-------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Apitonian echoed earlier positive comments about 
USG initiatives at the UN to promote democracy and 
governance.  He said the GOAM was anxious to continue its 
current role with respect to the Democracy Caucus and said 
the GOAM viewed itself as a model among its regional 
neighbors in this regard. 
 
-------------------- 
BAN ON HUMAN CLONING 
-------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Apitonian noted the GOAM\'s confusion as to when the 
topic of human cloning might be discussed at UNGA.  He said 
that, despite conflicting information from some governments, 
the GOAM was operating under the assumption that it would be 
part of the 60th UNGA and not included in discussions this 
year.  He was well aware of the Costa Rican resolution and, 
while non-committal, suggested that Armenia\'s Mission in New 
York had not appeared enthusiastic about lending its 
support. 
 
----------------------- 
MIDDLE EAST RESOLUTIONS 
----------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Apitonian reviewed Armenia\'s voting record on 
Middle East resolutions during last year\'s UNGA and 
predicted that the GOAM and would not go far beyond this 
position during the 59th UNGA.  While still too early to 
make a commitment either way, he said that an abstention 
from the GOAM was likely in most of these cases raised in 
the demarche.  He noted, however, that there was increasing 
caution within the MFA about the GOAM\'s position on any 
resolution (at UNGA, the OSCE or within other international 
fora) regarding the situation in the Middle East that might 
be interpreted as applicable to the conflict with Azerbaijan 
over Nagorno-Karabakh. 
 
-------------------- 
ARMENIAN INITIATIVES 
-------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Apitonian said the GOAM was still hopeful in its 
efforts at the UN regarding \"2005 as the Year of Prevention 
of Genocide and War Crimes.\"  He said that a joint 
initiative among CIS countries in commemoration of World War 
II could change the focus of the GOAM\'s efforts.  GOAM 
bureaucrats in New York and Yerevan are examining 
possibilities for combining the issues, Apitonian noted.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) The GOAM has indicated that it may be ready to 
present its MCA compact proposal to the GOAM\'s MCA Board by 
September 1, and to follow this with a consultative process 
that we understand will include the donor community here.  A 
recent consultative session in Armenia\'s Syunik region was a 
first-hand indication for Emboffs that the GOAM has taken 
the MCA process to the people, but that logistical 
complications resulting from using the country\'s Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) consultative structures may 
be causing the GOAM to miss some of its target audience. 
The GOAM acknowledged this issue during a recent GOAM MCA 
Board meeting and told the Embassy that it is addressing the 
problem and repeating meetings where all NGOs might not have 
had the opportunity to attend.  Recent press releases 
regarding high-level USG-GOAM meetings in Washington and in 
Yerevan have put MCA-related issues back in the media 
spotlight.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
GOAM AIMS FOR SEPTEMBER 1 INTERNAL DEADLINE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) MCA issues dominated discussion during a July 21 
meeting of Armenia\'s PRSP commission (ref B).  USAID and IFI 
representatives attended the meeting at the GOAM\'s 
invitation.  Minister of Finance and Economy Vardan 
Khachatryan announced during the meeting that the GOAM was 
reviewing the input and proposals from a number of NGOs and 
international organizations and would incorporate them to 
the extent possible into the GOAM\'s compact proposal by its 
internal September 1 deadline.  According to Khachatryan, 
the GOAM will submit the proposal o/a that date to the GOAM 
MCA Board for comment and review.  We understand that this 
will be followed by another round of public consultations, 
which will also include the donor community here, prior to 
submitting the compact proposal to the MCC. 
 
3. (U) The MFE acknowledged publicly during the meeting that 
the use of the GOAM\'s PRSP consultative structure has caused 
some confusion in some cases and may have \"unintentionally 
missed some of the NGO community.\"  It was also reported on 
the sidelines of the meeting that the GOAM has instructed 
regional governments and PRSP NGO networks to repeat or 
expand consultative sessions in those areas where this may 
have occurred.  According to reports, select Yerevan-based 
NGOs that have not attended or commented on previous MCA 
discussions, including the Open Society Institute, have been 
recently approached by the GOAM\'s MCA Board and invited to 
hold consultative sessions with their affiliate NGOs and 
submit their comments this month. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
EMBOFFS ATTEND CONSULTATIVE SESSION IN SYUNIK REGION 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4. (U) Embassy and USAID representatives attended a 
consultative meeting co-hosted by the GOAM MCA Board and 
municipal leaders in the southern town of Goris on July 23. 
Approximately 25 people attended the meeting, including 
three representatives of the GOAM MCA board (whose official 
capacities include responsibility for implementation of the 
GOAM\'s PRSP).  NGOs sending representatives to the meeting 
included:  The Goris Teacher\'s Union; the PERAS 
Organization; the Partnership Arch; the Goris Boomerang; the 
Goris Karate Federation; the Goris Artists\' Union; the Tteni 
Partnership; and the Employees\' and Teachers\' Union of the 
Goris Arts Center. 
5. (U) GOAM MCA Board representative and GOAM PRSP 
Coordinator Hovik Azizyan opened the meeting by explaining 
the GOAM\'s opinion that a tangible link should exist between 
the PRSP and any MCA compact submission.  Azizyan presented 
the general sectors in which the GOAM expected to submit a 
compact proposal (rural roads, irrigation, social sector 
including health and/or education).  NGOs took an active 
role in the ensuing discussion and appeared unhindered in 
voicing their opinions.  In a brainstorming session, NGO 
representatives and other attendees made a list of priority 
areas they want the GOAM to consider when completing its MCA 
compact proposal.  The final list ranked the areas as 
follows: 
-- rehabilitation of irrigation and drinking water systems 
-- school renovation and heating projects 
-- rehabilitation of rural roads 
-- job creation programs 
 
6. (SBU) NGOs, while calling the meeting mostly productive, 
voiced disappointment about what they perceived as 
lackluster participation by other NGOs in the region.  They 
said that some NGO representatives were confused about the 
nature of the consultations and thought its purpose was to 
discuss the implications of the PRSP, not the MCA. 
(Comment: Post has heard similar comments before.  While the 
PRSP mechanism has enabled the GOAM to quickly mobilize, it 
brings with it a certain amount of history and perhaps even 
prejudice on the part of some NGOs.  While far from totally 
debilitating it is a valid concern about the consultative 
process, which the GOAM appears committed to addressing - 
see para. 3 above. End Comment.)  NGOs called on the GOAM 
and local leaders to convene an additional meeting in Goris 
and pledged to \"activate\" their internal NGO network to 
ensure that more NGOs were present for the next meeting. 
 
------------------------------------- 
RECENT DOMESTIC PRESS COVERAGE ON MCA 
------------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) There has been an increase in MCA-related media 
reports during recent weeks.  There was generally objective 
reporting of Senior Presidential Economic Advisor Vahram 
Nercissiantz\' mid-July meeting with the MCC Board in 
Washington.  In addition, MCA issues featured prominently in 
coverage of Ambassador Ordway\'s July 13 meeting with 
Minister of Finance and Economy Khachatryan.  Media reports 
tend to concentrate on the consultative process and 
emphasize the likely areas of concentration of Armenia\'s 
eventual MCA proposal (ref A).  GOAM and World Bank sources 
tell us that regular domestic coverage of the GOAM\'s MCA 
consultative process (including meeting proceedings and 
updates) continues on Armenia\'s public television network. 
The Armenian Embassy in Washington has already begun 
publicizing an August 18 press conference at the National 
Press Club in Washington with Nercissiantz as likely to 
cover MCA issues.

ARMENIA\'S GOVERNING COALITION 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Both supporters and critics of the ruling 
parliamentary coalition in Armenia\'s National Assembly took 
advantage of its one-year anniversary to stage public 
debates on its effectiveness and prospects for its future. 
Coalition leaders from the Republican Party of Armenia, 
\"Orinats-Yerkir\" (Country of Law) Party, and the Armenian 
Revolutionary Forces (\"ARF\" or \"Dashnaksutyun\") made 
relatively tame statements regarding the anniversary while 
National Assembly Speaker Artur Baghdasaryan lunged at the 
opportunity to showcase his contributions, the state of NA 
relations with the Executive and legislative \"successes\" of 
the past year.  Critics were quick to respond to 
Baghdasaryan\'s claims in both the press and during public 
meetings with their evaluation of NA effectivenes, claiming 
that the National Assembly\'s activities were at best only 
moderately successful.  With the opposition still boycotting 
and rumors of continued delays in parliament, some analysts 
claimed that the coalition\'s most significant feat over the 
past year had been that of survival.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
BAGHDASARYAN POINTS TO BIG NUMBERS AS BIG SUCCESS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3. (SBU) Taking advantage of the one-year anniversary of the 
ruling coalition, Speaker Artur Baghdassaryan again leapt 
into the public eye congratulating himself and governing 
coalition MPs for what he characterized as a record year of 
success in the NA.  Baghdasaryan stated that the National 
Assembly had been more productive than ever in terms of 
initiatives and legislation passed during his first year as 
Speaker and under the leadership of the governing coalition. 
He pointed to discussion of Constitutional Reform, the 
Electoral Code, and reforms involving the judiciary system 
and self-governing bodies as headlines from this year\'s 
deliberations.  According to Baghdasaryan, the National 
Assembly circulated 223 bills, adopted 178 laws and 418 
decisions and ratified 78 treaties during the 2003-2004 
session.  (Note:  Roughly half of the bills cited were 
government initiatives.  End Note.)  Baghdasaryan took 
advantage of anniversary events to note the prolonged 
absence of the opposition MPs during their current boycott. 
He portrayed them as petty, partisan, and uninvolved during 
the Spring session.  He stopped short of blaming them for 
recent delays in the National Assembly and responded 
defensively to suggestions that their absence was due in 
part to his failure to coax them back into Parliament. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
CRITICS:  COALITION \"PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL AT BEST\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (SBU) Critics of the coalition used the one-year 
anniversary of the governing coalition to argue that the 
coalition did not deliver on lofty promises made just one 
year ago.  Pointing to the Memorandum of Political Coalition 
signed by the leaders of the coalition in June 2003, 
journalists said the coalition stopped short of its stated 
goals to move ahead on constitutional reforms, enact 
legislation on the electoral system, refine economic policy 
implementation and legislate strong anti-corruption 
measures.  Critics pointed to certain \"failures\" as a 
discouraging sign for the prospects of this and any future 
governing coalition in Armenia.  They claimed that the 
coalition responded only to requests by the President and 
had turned the NA into a \"ritualistic body\" lacking 
legislative creativity or depth.  They portrayed the NA\'s 
discussion of constitutional reform as merely a response to 
the personal wish of the President.  Critics were also 
negative about the NA\'s work on electoral reform, saying any 
outcome would most likely be limited to stipulating the 
party rights of parliamentary majorities.  Despite these 
criticisms and claims that the NA was far too subject to the 
President, journalists and analysts admitted that the 
coalition did manage to stabilize relations with GOAM 
ministries. 
 
------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The coalition\'s numbers at first seem impressive 
when compared to previous sittings of the National Assembly. 
Baghdasaryan\'s superficial inventory of legislative 
achievements and skeptical private comments by MPs, however, 
leave one to wonder how much Baghdasaryan or other coalition 
members truly believe the anniversary fanfare.  The fact 
that the coalition has lasted a year admittedly came as a 
surprise to many in Yerevan.  Critics are correct in 
asserting that at the very least the coalition managed to 
not only survive but to thrive, with the most interesting 
political wrangling in Armenia taking place within the 
coalition rather than between the coalition and opposition.

SUBJECT: CENTRAL BANK, MINISTRIES SCRAMBLE TO KEEP THE 
DRAM STABLE AGAINST THE DOLLAR 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) As the Central Bank of Armenia\'s (CBA) 
Chairman Tigran Sargsyan left for his summer holiday 
July 19, a sharp and unexpected appreciation of the 
Armenian Dram (AMD) against the dollar and euro caused 
uncertainty and suspicion in Armenia\'s currency 
markets.  With rare volatility, the dram rose 10 
percent against the dollar (to AMD 495) in the 
beginning of the week of July 19, its highest level 
since 1998, only to fall back by 6 percent later in the 
week.  The press and the banking community blamed the 
CBA for reacting too slowly, hinting that the market 
had been manipulated with the tacit acquiescence of the 
bank.  The CBA appeared to intervene only after a 
political meeting with the President and Ministry of 
Finance and Economy (MFE), despite the bank\'s 
ostensible autonomy.  Although it is too early to say 
what caused the sudden volatility, the bumpy ride 
exposed the lack of confidence the banking community 
has in the ability of Armenia\'s currency markets to 
resist speculative manipulation, and of the CBA to 
guarantee the stability of the Dram.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
DRAM CHANGES COURSE IN 2004 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Since it was introduced in 1993 and until the 
end of 2003, the Dram continued on a slow depreciation 
against the dollar of about 3 percent annually.  This 
year, due only in part to the dollar\'s fall against all 
currencies, the Dram has steadily climbed from its all- 
time low (AMD 590/1 USD) in December 2003.  By the end 
of the first quarter it gained value to 560 and reached 
540 by the end of the second quarter.  In contrast to 
the dram\'s steady rise all year, last week\'s 
appreciation to AMD 495 USD was widely viewed as too 
high, triggering banks and businesses to quickly buy 
dollars aiming to turn a quick profit.  The MFE tried 
to intervene at this point and purchase USD 10 million 
in dollars, but the CBA prevented the sale and instead 
intervened by lowering the overnight Dram lending rate 
by a point. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
THE CENTRAL BANK: \"WE HAVE A FREE FLOATING CURRENCY\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
3. (SBU) In a recent conversation with the Ambassador, 
the Chairman of the CBA, Tigran Sargsyan, commented 
that the sharp appreciation of AMD was caused by 
seasonal factors, such as foreign remittances, 
increased investment flows and tourism.  Sargsyan 
insisted that the CBA is following the free-float 
pricing policy for its currency and does not interfere 
in the foreign exchange market.  He predicted that the 
recent volatility would be stabilized by October, when 
seasonal effects are weaker. 
4. (SBU) Local bankers note that there has no 
significant increase in the inflow of tourism dollars 
or remittances that could explain the Dram\'s rise.  The 
stability of the Dram during last year\'s inflow of USD 
80 million from the Lincy foundation suggests that 
small increases in foreign trade or remittances are 
unlikely to be the sole cause of such volatility.  The 
Central Bank and two private bankers noted that there 
was no significant difference in transfers of dollars 
from abroad, suggesting that Armenia\'s economy is 
sufficiently dollarized that significant amounts of 
dollars can enter the market without the necessity for 
international transfers. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
USING DRAM APPRECIATION TO MEET INFLATION TARGETS? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5. (SBU) The press and bankers alike have accused the 
CBA of allowing (or even orchestrating) the 
appreciation in order to meet their increasingly 
unrealistic inflation target of 3 percent.  For its 
part the bank denies managing a controlled currency 
float, although the bank of course periodically buys 
and sells the dollars and euros it keeps as reserve 
currency.  In a conversation before the sudden peak, 
CBA board member Vache Gabrielyan commented that the 
Central Bank had substantial foreign currency reserves, 
so he didn\'t expect that the bank would purchase 
dollars to offset the rising Dram as it has done in the 
past. 
 
6. (SBU) Note:  Consumer price inflation was 8.6 
percent last year, due to a rise in the world price of 
food commodities, especially wheat.  A 3 percent target 
next year seems unrealistic, as fuel and water tariffs 
will likely rise.  Because Armenia relies heavily on 
imports for its basic consumables, a rise in the Dram 
should have downward pressure on inflation.  But 
despite the steady appreciation of the Dram this year, 
inflation remains high at 4.5 percent because basic 
foodstuffs are not sold in competitive markets, but 
rather, by de facto import monopolies which translate 
lower costs into higher profits.  End Note. 
 
-------------- 
DRAMATIC IRONY 
-------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The impetus to intervene to stabilize the Dram 
appeared to come from outside the CBA, which is charged 
with maintaining its stability.  According to Deputy 
Minister of Finance David Avetissian, the President 
convened an urgent meeting July 21 with the CBA 
Chairman and the Minister of Finance and Economy to 
discuss the rapid rise of the Dram.  Minister of 
Finance Vardan Khachatryan told the press that he had 
outlined the danger of a strong Dram to the state 
budget, which is financed in part in foreign currency 
by international donor organizations.  To counteract 
the threat, Khachatryan proposed that the Ministry 
intervene on the currency market to buy USD 10 million 
in dollars, which the budget could use to service loans 
to foreign lenders.  The CBA objected, claiming 
(rightly) that such interventions were the exclusive 
domain of the Central Bank.  The CBA then proposed to 
lower the overnight Dram lending rate, which should 
have encouraged some banks to switch short-term assets 
into dollars.  Deputy Minister Avetissian said that the 
Dram depreciated by 6 percent shortly after the 
meeting, as speculators became confident that the Dram 
increase would be controlled. 
 
------------ 
SPECULATION? 
------------ 
 
7. (SBU) A prominent banker, along with the media, 
suggested that speculators drove the Dram up under the 
assumption that currency traders would overreact, 
allowing the speculators to purchase back dollars at an 
even lower price.  The banker added that one local 
commercial bank was actively selling dollars when the 
Dram was very high, raising suspicions that they were 
somehow trying to manipulate the market.  Although 
Chairman Sargsyan insisted that any speculation in the 
foreign exchange market would be noticed by the Central 
Bank, the recent rapid appreciation and fallback of the 
dram has sparked speculation that someone is 
manipulating the currency markets to his financial 
benefit.  Minister Khachatryan noted in a press 
conference that President Kocharian had ordered an 
investigation of transactions during last week to 
ascertain the cause of the Dram\'s fleeting spike. 
------------------------------------------- 
COMMENT: FINANCIAL MARKETS STILL VULNERABLE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Recent events highlight the fact that Armenia 
is a small economy that lacks developed financial 
markets, and is vulnerable to even medium-scale 
currency flows.  Currency traders don\'t appear to know 
what to expect from the monetary authorities at the 
Central Bank.  The fact that it apparently took a 
political meeting to enforce a monetary solution casts 
doubt on the Central Bank\'s nominal autonomy.  Whatever 
the cause of the sharp fluctuation in the currency 
market, the press and the banking community alike were 
quick to note their lack of confidence in the CBA\'s 
ability to ensure a stable and predictable monetary 
policy.

SUBJECT: ARMENIA TRIES TO SQUEEZE VALUE FROM DIAMONDS 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (U) While constituting only 5 percent of GDP, Armenia\'s 
rapidly expanding diamond cutting industry attracts both 
strong domestic attention and significant foreign 
investment.  Precious and simple to transport, diamonds 
overcome Armenia\'s closed borders and high transport costs. 
A history of diamond cutting, low wages, and a preferential 
quota arrangement with Russia fueled early growth in the 
diamond sector.  Increases in diamond production have caused 
a sharp, albeit specious, increase in Armenia\'s trade 
numbers, and have proved a handy source of foreign currency. 
On the other hand, the industry brings almost no tax revenue 
to government coffers.  The government is looking to a new 
strategy to encourage diamond polishers to sell their 
diamonds and thus take their profits in Armenia.  Investment 
by the diamond industry\'s heavy hitters suggests that 
wholesale diamond sales could have a future in Armenia, 
which would transform the industry from an expanding source 
of jobs to a strong growth sector.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
DIAMOND CUTTING HERALDS GROWTH IN EXPORTS... 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Strong growth in the diamond cutting industry has 
greatly expanded Armenia\'s external economy, despite having 
little effect on its domestic books.  Since 1998 exports of 
diamonds have increased seven fold to nearly USD 378 million 
in 2003 (imports of raw diamonds expanded from USD 45 
million to USD 343 million over the same period).  Exports 
of diamonds accounted for 53.5 percent of all exports and 
the continuing expansion of the inward processing diamond 
industry pushed up overall exports and imports markedly, 
causing trade to increase by 35 percent in dollar terms in 
2003. 
 
-------------- 
...BUT NOT GDP 
-------------- 
 
4. (U) Despite large effects on Armenia\'s trade statistics, 
diamond processing barely leaves a mark on Armenia\'s GDP, or 
for that matter, tax revenues.  The value added in diamond 
polishing is low, from 5 to 10 percent, and most diamonds 
are processed in Armenia and sold on low, cost-plus terms to 
parent companies abroad.  The diamond industry brings only a 
couple million dollars per year in profit tax revenue, and 
no VAT revenue as diamonds are exempted as an export 
industry.  Because Armenia captures so little of a diamond\'s 
value added in Armenia, the sector\'s value to the Armenian 
economy is in effect limited to the 5,500 jobs it provides, 
with average monthly wages of USD 300. 
 
------------------------------ 
SQUEEZING VALUE FROM A DIAMOND 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) According to Gagik Mkrtchian, Head of the 
Department of Gems and Jewelry at the Ministry of Trade and 
Economic Development, the government is seeking to capture 
more of the industry\'s value-added by encouraging wholesale 
sales of loose diamonds in country.  According to Mkrtchian, 
his office has submitted a plan to create a diamond sales 
center in Armenia that could be one-stop-shop for wholesale 
buyers, providing a forum for the diamond factories to 
exhibit diamonds and for buyers to secure necessary export 
and Kimberley process documentation.  While Mkrtchian\'s 
plans are still abstract, Armenia\'s largest diamond factory 
has put the same idea into bricks and mortar.  On a recent 
visit to the Shoghakn factory, owned by the world\'s largest 
private diamond manufacturer, Lev Leviyev, the factory 
manager showed the Ambassador a new building that has been 
finished as a showroom for wholesale buyers.  The manager 
said they intend to bring sales of wholesale diamonds to 
Armenia, operating from the factory showroom.  According to 
Mkrtchian, sales of finished loose diamonds could capture up 
to 30 percent of the diamond\'s value added in Armenia. 
While having little effect on the company\'s balance sheets, 
moving sales to Armenia could have a great effect on 
Armenia\'s books.  While sales would be exempt for VAT tax 
(diamonds are exempt until set into jewelry) any sales here 
would be revenues recorded in Armenia on which the Armenian 
incorporated subsidiary would have to pay profit tax. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
BIG PRODUCERS LOOK BEYOND RUSSIAN SUPPLIES 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (SBU) As the diamond sector expands in Armenia and the 
industry\'s largest players expand their operations here, the 
case for bringing sales here grows stronger.  The ultimate 
sustainability of Armenia\'s diamond sector depends on its 
diamond firms becoming global players and less dependant on 
waning Russian supply.  No factor is more important to the 
success of a diamond factory than ensuring a consistent 
supply of raw diamonds.  Of Armenia\'s 50 diamond-polishing 
factories, few are large players who can secure supply lines 
worldwide.  The Aslanian family, partnered with the 
prestigious diamond firm Rosy Blue, operates a diamond 
factory in Lori province supplied from Belgium with high 
quality diamonds from around the world.  Lev Leviyev, an 
Israeli (also a Russian citizen) billionaire from 
Uzbekistan, procures diamonds for his Shoghakn plant from 
various mines in Africa.  The Diamond Company of Armenia, 
owned by the British Ferfano Company, sources its production 
of 8,000 carats per month from De Beers. 
 
------------------------------- 
SMALL PRODUCERS LOOK THREATENED 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Armenia\'s smaller producers depend on a 
preferential quota agreement with Alrosa, the Russian 
diamond supplier.  Each year the Russian government permits 
export of up to 400,000 carats of rough diamonds to Armenia, 
which are distributed among Armenia\'s operating diamond 
factories.  The actual number of diamonds received from 
Russia is much smaller.  In 2003 Armenian factories received 
only 130,000 carats of raw diamonds from Russia, and they 
have received 100,000 carats in the first six months of 
2004.  Shoghakn\'s general manager insists that Russian 
supply is increasingly less important as prices are rising 
and the quotas are unfulfilled.  Mkrtchian added that many 
of the smaller factories are now idle, and prospects for the 
future of Russian supply are not good.  As Russia moves to 
accede to the WTO, Mkrtchian reminded us, it must end 
preferential supply arrangements and Alrosa\'s quota system. 
Mkrtchian concluded that the future of Armenia\'s diamond 
industry depends on the leadership of the large diamond 
producers. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) As the preferential supply of Russian diamonds 
wanes, the future of Armenia\'s diamond sector depends on the 
ability of the GOAM to encourage the big producers to expand 
their Armenian operations and to consolidate efforts to 
bring buyers to Armenia.  The prospect of onward sales 
present tempting rewards for tax revenue, and Armenia has 
(rightly) chosen to tread lightly on the industry, exempting 
diamond producers from the VAT hassles that burden other 
exporters.  Diamond companies can easily shift production 
among their factories, and continued diamond-friendly tax 
policy will encourage the big producers to expand and open 
wholesale operations in Armenia.

Republic of Armenia and on behalf of other Armenians 
who are potential class members in the above- 
referenced class action case to seek your 
intercession before a settlement agreement is 
approved at the Final Fairness Hearing, effectively 
foreclosing their right to obtain just compensation 
from the New York Life Insurance Company (\"NYLIC\"). 
The Final Fairness Hearing is scheduled for 9:30 
a.m. on Friday, July 30, 2004, before U.S. Judge 
Christina A. Snyder in Courtroom 5 of the United 
States District Court, Los Angeles, CA. 
 
Unfortunately, this case and its implications for 
the rights of Armenians have been brought to the 
attention of the government of the Republic of 
Armenia recently by descendants of NYLIC policy 
holders in Armenia after the opt-out period had 
passed.  Now the case is at a critical juncture when 
some of class members are pursuing a settlement that 
is likely to foreclose for all practical purposes 
the rights of Armenian citizens and the citizens of 
other nations. 
 
Approximately 85 years ago, the U.S. government 
assisted NYLIC in successfully avoiding the claims 
of the Republic of Turkey to what NYLIC estimated in 
correspondence with the U.S. government to be the 
USD 7 million face value of policies of Armenians 
that perished in the Armenian Genocide.  Now, some 
90 years after the Armenian Genocide, NYLIC is 
proposing to settle the claims of all Armenians 
worldwide for Genocide insurance claims for what 
could be as little as USD 7 million for the 
descendants of Armenian insureds.  Additional 
amounts will go to American charities with an 
Armenian focus, attorneys fees and administrative 
costs for a total of USD 20 million. 
 
At this juncture, we do not have enough information 
to determine if this is a fair and equitable 
settlement.  Nonetheless, we do note with 
significant concern and interest that when NYLIC 
successfully asked the U.S. government for 
protection from the claims of the Republic of Turkey 
85 years ago, it estimated its liability on this 
issue to be USD 7 million and now when it has come 
time to pay the descendants of the Armenian 
insureds, it has produced a list of policyholders 
for the purposes of settlement that totals somewhere 
between USD 700,000 and USD 1.34 million. 
 
On behalf of our citizens, which we believe may 
represent one-third to one-half of the worldwide 
class members of this case, the Republic of Armenia 
would like a modest amount of time to determine (i) 
if the overall amount is fair and equitable, (ii) if 
the case has been handled properly (as you know, the 
interests of plaintiff and contingency fee lawyers 
are frequently divergent from their clients), (iii) 
if there has been an adequate forensic accounting of 
sorts to explain how a USD 7 million liability has 
become a USD 700,000 to USD 1.34 million liability. 
 
Although many of the potential class members in this 
case reside in the United States, it is our 
understanding and belief that more of the potential 
class members live outside of the United States. 
After the Armenian Genocide, the majority of 
Armenians took refuge in what is now Armenia, Russia 
and other countries outside of the United States. 
 
In the past, Armenians dispersed throughout the 
world did not have a sovereign representative to 
protect the nation\'s interests or the interests of 
those individuals of Armenian ancestry who live 
outside of Armenia.  With regained independence, the 
Republic of Armenia is in a position to protect and 
promote national interests and by this letter seeks 
to play a constructive role in assuring that the 
resolution of this and similar claims is concluded 
fairly and equitably for all potential 
beneficiaries, including distribution of a portion 
of the settlement to charitable organizations in the 
United States and elsewhere. 
 
We are concerned that, among other things, the court 
case and ensuing settlement have not given the 
potential class members in Armenia and other 
countries outside of the United States effective or 
adequate notice of their rights to participate in or 
opt out of this class action.  Although 
announcements of the settlement were carried in 
approximately eight U.S.-based newspapers of general 
circulation and community newspapers, we note that 
only two newspapers in Armenia, with a combined 
circulation of under 5,000 carried the notice.  What 
was even more disappointing was that the key 
information was contained in a website whose address 
was incorrectly printed in these Armenian newspaper 
announcements. 
 
Given the lack of experience with and awareness of 
U.S. class actions in Armenia, these announcements 
fall significantly short of internationally 
guaranteed norms of due process.   Moreover, many 
other large populations of Armenians, who are 
potential class members, for example, in Russia and 
other countries, have not had even this level of 
notice about their rights and options.  While we 
understand that it is not possible to reach every 
possible class member, in order to assure minimum 
due process and fairness, the large populations in 
Armenia, Russia, Middle East and elsewhere in the 
CIS, representing more than three times the number 
of potential class members as in the U.S., required 
effective notice and a meaningful opportunity to be 
heard, which was not given. 
 
The Republic of Armenia seeks your intercession and 
support for a six-month temporary extension of the 
Fairness Hearing in this case.  While we understand 
that speedy closure of proceedings is desirable, 
under the circumstances, this continuance of the 
proceeding will help to avoid collateral litigation 
in the U.S. courts and abroad, conserve judicial 
resources, and assure a fair outcome not only for 
the hundreds of thousands of potential 
claimants/beneficiaries in the United States, but 
also for the millions of potential 
claimants/beneficiaries in Armenia, Russia and 
elsewhere. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
 
/s/ 
 
Davit Harytyunyan 
Minister of Justice

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) With 64 registered political parties (as of 
July 30, 2004) voters in Armenia suffer no lack of 
choice.  The following parties are represented 
within the National Assembly (NA):  the Republican 
Party of Armenia, Armenian Revolutionary Federation 
(ARF) Dashnaktsutyun, Country of Law (Orinats 
Yerkir), People\'s Party of Armenia, National Accord 
Party, Republic Party and United Labor Party. 
(Note:  The governing coalition consists of the 
Republican Party of Armenia, Armenian Revolutionary 
Federation (ARF) Dashnaktsutyun, and Country of Law 
(Orinats Yerkir).  There are an additional 17 MPs in 
the Peoples\' Deputy group that generally support the 
government, and 15 MPs who are not aligned with any 
faction or group.  The remainder oppose the current 
government.  End Note.)  Other significant parties 
include:  the National Democratic Union, 
Constitutional Rights Union, Social Democratic 
Hnchakian Party, Armenian National Movement, Liberal 
Democratic Ramkavar Party, Self Determination Union, 
Communist Party, and the Christian Democratic Party. 
There are several dozen other minor registered 
parties.  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
REPUBLICAN PARTY 
---------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Founded in 1988, the Republican Party (RP) 
was formally registered May 14, 1991.  With 40 out 
of 131 seats in the National Assembly, the RP has 
significant clout:  its key figures include party 
chairman Prime Minister Andranik Margaryan, and 
Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Tigran 
Torosian.  Former Soviet-era dissident Ashot 
Navasardyan founded the RP in 1988.  Military units 
formed under the Party\'s banner fought in the N-K 
war.  Later the units were merged with the regular 
army.  At the end of 1994, RP switched from being in 
opposition to the government to joining the Republic 
bloc led by the then-ruling ANM party.  In 1998 RP, 
led by then Defense Minister Vazgen Sargsyan, merged 
with the Yerkrapah Union of the Karabakh war 
volunteers and, a few months later, on the eve of 
the 1999 parliamentary elections formed the Unity 
bloc with the newly-established People\'s Party of 
Armenia.  A pro-government party, RP formed an 
electoral alliance with the ARF Dashanaktsutyun and 
Orinats Yerkir on the eve of the 2003 parliamentary 
race.  The electoral alliance earned a landslide 
victory with an overwhelming majority in the 
National Assembly.  RP is currently considered a 
ruling party.  It supports economic and democratic 
reforms and favors a strong executive branch. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Armenian Revolutionary Federation Dashnaktsutyun 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4. (SBU) Founded in 1890 in Tbilisi by Armenian 
nationalist and socialist revolutionaries who 
operated in the Caucasus and Western Armenia, the 
Armenian Revolutionary Federation Dashnaktsutyun 
(ARF) was first registered in Armenia July 2, 1991. 
The party was subsequently banned December 28, 1994, 
but the GOAM lifted the ban in 1998 (citing changed 
political circumstances).  Key figures include Hrant 
Margarian, Vahan Hovhannisian, Armen Rustamian, 
Levon Mkrtchian, and Aghvan Vardanian.  The ARF 
operates two newspapers, \"Yerkir\" (Country) and 
\"Hayots Ashkharh\" (The Armenian World).  ARF 
controls 11 out of 131 seats in the National 
Assembly. 
 
5. (SBU) The ARF-Dashnaktsutyun has been the most 
popular \"traditional\" party and the most active 
political force in the Armenian Diaspora.  The 
Dashnak Party ruled the first Armenian Republic of 
1918.  In 1920, it ceded power to the Communist 
Party.  Many Dashnaks fled Armenia, while others 
were repressed.  The Dashnak Party was banned in 
Armenia during the Soviet period.  The growth of 
glasnost during the last few years of the USSR 
allowed the Dashnaks to reestablish themselves in 
Armenia in 1988.  Nevertheless, the main ruling body 
of the party, the Bureau, remains in Athens, Greece. 
From the outset, the Dashnak Party was the major 
opposition force to the Armenian government in 
power.  On December 28, 1994, President Ter- 
Petrossian banned the party by decree.  He accused 
the party of criminal activities, drug trafficking, 
assassinations, and fostering of terrorist groups 
(the so-called \"Dro\" clandestine organization.)  The 
President\'s decree was followed by a decision of the 
Supreme Court to suspend the Party in January 1995 
since it did not comply with the country\'s laws 
banning party membership of non-Armenian citizens. 
Several ARF leaders spent several years in jail. 
After LTP\'s resignation in February 1998, then 
acting president Kocharian released ARF leaders due 
to the \"changed political situation.\"  ARF is 
currently a pro-government party. 
 
6. (SBU) The Dashnak Party is a socialist- 
nationalist party.  It sees its ultimate goal as 
pursuing \"The Armenian Cause,\" worldwide recognition 
of the Armenian genocide, and integration of Western 
and Eastern Armenia into one powerful state. 
Traditionally, party activities have not been 
transparent.  In the course of its history, the 
party carried out a number of \"revenge acts\" against 
Turkish diplomats and other citizens.  The ARF 
supports the independent status of Karabakh and any 
decision to promote its independence.  Members of 
the ARF fought actively in the Karabakh conflict and 
the party had its own military units.  Later, when 
Karabakh and Armenia formed regular armies, some of 
the Dashnak units merged with the armies, others 
were disarmed.  The ARF remains a major political 
force in the Armenian Diaspora, and retains a wide 
support base in Armenia, especially among the youth. 
 
------------------------------- 
COUNTRY OF LAW (ORINATS YERKIR) 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The Orinats Yerkir Party (Country of Law) 
(OY) was founded in 1998 under the direction of its 
Chairman, Speaker of the National Assembly Arthur 
Baghdasarian, and holds 20 out of 131 seats in the 
NA.  Established on the eve of the 1999 
parliamentary elections, OY appeared to have the 
support of then-Minister of National Security and 
Interior Serzh Sargsian.  A new player on the 
Armenian political arena, OY nevertheless overcame 
the 5 percent threshold at the 1999 parliamentary 
elections and ended up having 5 seats in the 
parliament.  Four years later OY impressively 
expanded its parliamentary group to 20 members with 
its chairman Baghdasarian elected as a NA speaker. 
 
8. (SBU) A right-centrist party, OY emphasizes 
legislative activities and is responsible for more 
than 30 percent of all drafts submitted to the 
parliament in 1999-2003.  OY is one of the few 
parties with a well-organized structure and strong 
regional branches.  During the 2003 parliamentary 
electoral campaign OY made \"generous\" -- and quite 
unrealistic -- promises to increase salaries and 
return Soviet-era savings -- a move that added to 
OY\'s reputation as a \"bunch of populists.\" 
Currently, OY is trying to push some of these highly 
controversial drafts through the parliament. 
 
------------------------- 
PEOPLE\'S PARTY OF ARMENIA 
------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) The People\'s Party of Armenia (PPA) was 
founded in 1999.  It holds 5 of the 14 seats 
controlled by the Justice Bloc in the National 
Assembly (out of 131 total).  Founded by the former 
First Secretary of the Armenian Communist Party, 
charismatic Karen Demirchian, the PPA unites the so- 
called \"red directors\" and former Soviet 
nomenclatura, as well as people opposed to Robert 
Kocharian.  Demirchian\'s son, Stepan, inherited the 
party after the October 27 assassinations; thus far, 
however, he has not demonstrated his father\'s 
charisma, maturity or experience.  Ideologically, 
the PPA is a right-centrist party; most of its 
energy, however, has been spent on an anti-Kocharian 
campaign.  (Note:  The leadership of the PPA remains 
strongly convinced that Kocharian was involved in 
the October 27, 1999 assassinations.  End Note.)  In 
2001 there was a mass exodus from the PPA rumored to 
be initiated by the President\'s office.  As a 
result, the PPA lost all of its key positions in the 
National Assembly. 
10. (SBU) According to official Central Election 
Commission results of the second round of the 2003 
presidential elections, Demirchian received 32.48 
percent of votes vice 67.52 percent received by 
President Kocharian.  The opposition parties claim 
election fraud and falsification; the election 
results were disputed at the Constitutional Court. 
While the Constitutional Court\'s final ruling upheld 
Kocharian\'s victory, the court suggested holding a 
vote of confidence for Kocharian in order to confirm 
his legitimacy.  Although later the Court withdrew 
its suggestion, claiming there was no more need for 
such a vote, this controversial statement triggered 
a round of debates in the parliament that resulted 
in the opposition boycotting NA sessions. 
 
--------------- 
NATIONAL ACCORD 
--------------- 
 
11. (SBU) The National Accord party (also known as 
\"National Unity\" party) was founded in 1997. 
National Accord is a right-centrist party built 
around its leader, Artashes Geghamian. Currently the 
party has 8 of 131 seats in the parliament.  A 
former Soviet apparatchik, Geghamian became popular 
through his anti-Kocharian populist speeches.  After 
the parliamentary killings in 1999 Geghamian 
supported President Kocharian and allegedly hoped 
(in vain) to be appointed Prime Minister.  Since 
then Geghamian has been one of the harshest critics 
of the current regime. 
 
12. (SBU) Following complicated negotiations, the 
party refused to become a part of the Justice bloc 
during the 2003 parliamentary elections.  In the 
beginning of 2004, however, the National Accord 
faction, along with the Justice Block deputies, 
decided to boycott the National Assembly sessions. 
Some sources report that the party is financed from 
Russia, others note that the party is financed by 
former N-K \"Defense Minister\" Samvel Babayan 
(especially for the 1999 parliamentary elections). 
 
-------------- 
REPUBLIC PARTY 
-------------- 
 
13. (SBU) Founded in 2001, the Republic Party (RP) 
has 2 of the 14 Justice Bloc seats in the National 
Assembly, and is led by co-chairmen Aram Sargsyan 
and Albert Bazeyan.  The RP was originally 
established as an opposition party by a group of 
former government officials that include ex-Prime 
Minister Sargsyan, ex-Mayor of Yerevan Bazeyan, ex- 
Defense Minister Harutyunian, ex-Minister of Tax 
Minister Ayvazian, ex-deputy Health Minister 
Zeynalyan, etc.  They have opposed the current 
authorities starting after the October 27, 1999 
parliamentary assassinations; their current 
relations with the government are deeply 
antagonistic.  The RP never dropped its allegations 
claiming that President Kocharian was directly 
involved in the October 27 events and has strongly 
criticized the authorities for a \"biased and 
incomplete\" investigation of the October 27 criminal 
case.  Most of the RP founding members split from 
the Republican Party citing \"opportunism\" and 
collaboration with Kocharian in 1999-2000; they 
established the RP with essentially one goal in 
mind, to oust Kocharian. 
 
14. (SBU) The RP strongly supported Stepan 
Demirchian during the 2003 presidential elections 
and formed an election Justice bloc with the 
People\'s Party of Armenia on the eve of the 2003 
National Assembly (NA) elections.  The Justice 
Bloc\'s election performance was disappointing for 
its members: the bloc garnered only 14 seats.  In 
parliament, the RP actively pushed for a referendum 
on a presidential vote of confidence; the pro- 
government majority, however, torpedoed the 
referendum vote and since then the RP, together with 
other opposition members, has been boycotting the NA 
sessions and claimed they would move the anti- 
Kocharian campaign from parliament to the streets. 
In addition, the RP is currently considering 
replacing Demirchian with Aram Sargsyan due to what 
the party leadership perceives as Demirchian\'s lack 
of resourcefulness. 
 
------------------ 
UNITED LABOR PARTY 
------------------ 
 
15. (SBU) The United Labor Party (ULP) was founded 
in 2002, and is led by its chairman Gurgen Arsenian 
and Levon Poghosian.  The ULP holds 6 out of 131 
seats in the National Assembly.  The ULP was founded 
on the eve of the 2003 parliamentary elections by a 
group of wealthy businessmen and entrepreneurs.  A 
new player on the Armenian political arena, the ULP 
nevertheless overcame (following substantial 
financial outlays) the 5 percent parliamentary 
threshold and received 6 seats in the National 
Assembly.  The ULP is a pro-government party that 
strongly supports free market reforms and 
establishment of rule of law society.  In the 
National Assembly, the ULP pushes for comprehensive 
economic legislation aimed at encouraging Armenian 
exports, small and medium-sized businesses, and 
investments.  The ULP shows less interest, however, 
in \"pure politics;\" the only strong and critical 
statement that the ULP has made thus far was during 
politically charged debates on the controversial 
(and eventually failed) draft amendments to the law 
on military service in the parliament.  (Note:  ULP 
Chairman Arsenian is a father of two sons.  End 
Note.) 
 
------------------------- 
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC UNION 
------------------------- 
 
16. (SBU) The National Democratic Union (NDU) was 
founded in 1991 and registered March 19, 1992. 
Under the leadership of its chairman Vazgen 
Manukian, the NDU has 1 seat out of 131 in the 
National Assembly.  The NDU is one of the most 
active, albeit small, opposition parties.  Its 
leader, Vazgen Manukian, was one of the founders of 
the Karabakh Movement, one time former prime 
minister, former defense minister and former close 
ally of former president Ter-Petrossian.  The NDU is 
primarily a party of individuals; with neither a 
developed party structure nor rank-and-file 
organization, the NDU does not have a cohesive 
platform.  The NDU claims that the ruling elite has 
betrayed the ideas of democracy and a market 
economy, and is leading the country toward 
dictatorship.  In mid-90s the NDU advocated 
resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh (N-K) conflict by 
granting independent status to Karabakh in exchange 
for returning the occupied territories to 
Azerbaijan.  During the past two years, however, 
Manukian has attached more importance to regional 
development in the South Caucasus, placing the N-K 
conflict settlement and due process of reforms in 
Armenia into a regional context.  Most recently 
Manukian, as a Yerevan State University professor, 
was actively engaged in debates and meetings with 
students over the controversial bill on military 
service. 
 
17. (SBU) In the mid-90s Manukian was widely seen as 
the only individual in Armenia who could challenge 
then-president Ter-Petrossian in the 1996 
presidential elections.  Many election observers 
believe that Manukian did in fact win the 1996 
election.  Since then, however, the NDU has 
significantly weakened and gone through several 
splits.  The most recent division within the NDU in 
2001 appeared to be triggered mostly by the personal 
ambitions of some of its leaders; the core NDU 
group, however, survived. 
 
--------------------------- 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS UNION 
--------------------------- 
 
18. (SBU) The Constitutional Rights Union (CRU) was 
registered August 19, 1991 under the leadership of 
Hrant Kachatryan and currently has one member in the 
National Assembly.  An extremely small opposition 
party, the CRU also allegedly received significant 
support during the 1999 parliamentary elections from 
N-K \"Defense Minister\" Samvel Babayan.  The party 
opposes President Kocharian. 
 
------------------------------ 
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC HNCHAK PARTY 
------------------------------ 
 
19. (SBU) Social-Democratic Hnchak Party (SDHP) was 
founded in 1887 in Geneva and first registered in 
Armenia in 1991.  There is currently no chairman 
(following the controversial resignation of George 
Hakobian in late 2003).  The SDHP suspended 
publication of its weekly newspaper, the \"Hnchak 
Hayastani\" (Clarion of Armenia), several years ago 
due to financial problems.  The party has no seats 
in the National Assembly.  During the Soviet period, 
the party continued to function within the confines 
of the system.  Traditionally, SDHP has been 
extremely hostile to Dashnaks in the Diaspora.  SDHP 
is loosely organized without clearly specified 
program goals or strict hierarchy.  The Armenian 
branch of the SDHP maintains stronger ties with a 
diasporan party branch in Syria than with two other 
traditional parties, ARF Dashnaktsutyun and 
Ramkavars.  Since its return to Armenia in 1990, 
SDHP has been loyal and eager to cooperate with the 
authorities.  In mid-90, the Hnchak party, though 
ideologically socialist, allied itself with the then- 
ruling ANM party, and strongly supported Ter- 
Petrossian\'s administration; later on they supported 
Robert Kocharian equally strongly.  During the 2003 
presidential election campaign, however, SDHP then- 
chairman George Hakobian joined the opposition 
alliance of 16 parties to support Kocharian\'s major 
rival Stepan Demirchian -- a move that caused some 
controversy within the party. 
 
-------------------------- 
ARMENIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT 
-------------------------- 
 
20. (SBU) The Armenian National Movement (ANM) was 
founded in 1989 by former President Ter-Petrosyan 
along with other members of the \"Karabakh 
Committee.\"  The long-time \"party of power,\" it has 
seen its influence dwindle since Kocharian has been 
president.  The ANM favors a market economy, good 
relations with Turkey and a negotiated settlement of 
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.  Initially anti- 
Russian, the ANM more recently acknowledged the need 
for a \"special relationship\" with Russia. 
 
----------------------------------- 
DEMOCRATIC-LIBERAL PARTY (RAMKAVAR) 
----------------------------------- 
 
21. (SBU) The Democratic-Liberal Party (Ramkavar) 
was founded in 1921 in Istanbul following the 
unification of the Ramkavar (Democratic) and 
Azatagan (Liberal) parties; the party was registered 
in Armenia June 10, 1991.  Led by party chairman and 
National Assembly member Harutyun Karapetian, other 
key figures include the editor of the party\'s daily 
newspaper \"Azg\" (Nation) Hakob Avedikyan and the 
Tekeyan Society chairman Ruben Mirzakhanian.  In 
addition to \"Azg\" the party also has a weekly \"Djayn 
Ramkavarats\" (Voice of the Democrats) in Gyumri. 
 
22. (SBU) Ramkavar Party is one of the old, so- 
called traditional Armenian parties.  During the 
Soviet period, it was active in the Armenian 
Diaspora throughout the world and played, along with 
ARF Dashaktsutyun, a major role in preserving the 
Armenian Diaspora from assimilation.  Nevertheless, 
the Ramkavar and Dashnak parties have been 
traditionally hostile toward each other.  Following 
the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Ramkavars 
restored their operations in Armenia.  The Ramkavar 
Party of Armenia is technically distinct from its 
organization in the Armenian Diaspora; in practice, 
however, it coordinates closely with its 
headquarters abroad.  The Ramkavars stand for 
democracy, liberalism, and a free market economy and 
champion working through the system as opposed to 
revolutionary activities.  Ramkavars pursue centrist 
policies and do not ally themselves with other 
parties, since, as Ramkavars assert, they are all 
tainted with a revolutionary zeal for usurping 
power.  The party supports Armenia\'s integration 
into the world economy.  It perceives the middle and 
wealthy classes as the core of its party. 
 
------------------------ 
SELF-DETERMINATION UNION 
------------------------ 
 
23. (SBU) The Self-Determination Union is a marginal 
opposition party.  Founded in 1987 and registered 
July 29, 1991, the party opposes increased Russian 
and other foreign influence.  Its leader, U.S. legal 
permanent resident Paruyr Hayrikian, was born in 
Yerevan in 1949.  Hayrikian joined the underground 
United National Party in the late 1960s and was 
arrested in 1969.  Hayrikian spent 17 years in the 
KGB prison on charges of political dissent.  In 
1988, he was stripped of his Soviet citizenship and 
exiled to Ethiopia before moving to the U.S. 
Hayrikian returned to Armenia in 1990, was elected 
to the Parliament and served two terms (1990 and 
1995).  Hayrikian ran for the 1991 presidential 
election as Chairman of the Self-Determination 
Union, a right-center nationalistic party, and 
received 8 percent of the vote (Ter-Petrossian 
received 83 percent).  During the 1996 presidential 
election campaign Hayrikian joined the opposition 
alliance and supported their joint candidate Vazgen 
Manukian.  During the 1998 Presidential election, 
Hayrikian received 5.4 percent of the vote and chose 
to support Robert Kocharian for the run-off.  After 
Kocharian\'s election as President, Hayrikian was 
appointed Adviser to the President, Chairman of the 
Presidential Human Rights Committee, and Chairman of 
Constitutional Amendments Committee.  He resigned a 
few years later.  Hayrikian and his party have moved 
away from their earlier pro-government stance and 
now oppose the President. 
 
--------------- 
COMMUNIST PARTY 
--------------- 
 
24. (SBU) The Communist Party (CP) was formally 
registered July 29, 1991, as the successor of the 
Armenian branch of the Communist Party of the USSR. 
With fewer than 50,000 members country-wide (most of 
them quite elderly), the Communist Party is no 
longer especially influential.  The party favors 
close political and economic ties with Russia, at 
one point going so far as to call for a 
\"confederation,\" along with the Russia-Belarus

CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
-------------------------- 
 
25. (SBU) Former Prime Minister and former Speaker 
of the National Assembly Khosrov Harutyunian leads 
the Christian Democratic Party (CDP), founded in 
1991.  The party is a marginal left-centrist party 
that professes to a mix of liberal political 
philosophy and Christian values.  It currently has 
no seats in parliament.  One of the few Armenian 
parties with a woman in a leadership position, the 
CDP was chaired by Ida Martirosian until three years 
ago; she remains active in party affairs. 
 
--------------- 
NEW TIMES PARTY 
--------------- 
 
26. (SBU) The New Times Party was founded in 
February 2004 by Aram Karepetyan.  Although the New 
Times Party is only recently established, it is an 
important player among small opposition parties in 
Armenia.  A formal member of the opposition Justice 
bloc, the party nonetheless maintains its own agenda 
distinct from its membership in the coalition. 
During the opposition rallies that followed the 2003 
presidential elections, the party\'s chairman Aram 
Karapetyan commanded some of the largest audiences. 
The party\'s economic theories and a strong pro- 
Russian bias are unique among current political 
groups.

REGULATION 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly.  Not for internet distribution. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenia\'s Central Bank (CBA) has outlined a new 
reform program to strengthen the banking sector.  But bank 
officials caution that legal and regulatory reforms alone 
would do little to improve bank intermediation.  Despite 
significant consolidation and the recent closure of 
insolvent banks, Armenia\'s banks still struggle to attract 
deposits and are even worse at lending money.  Improving the 
banking sector is a priority for the government and the 
international donor community, as high lending rates and 
poor access to capital hamper small enterprises and raise 
costs for all businesses.  While touting reforms, CBA 
officials cite not the regulatory environment but cultural 
resistance to banking and a strong reluctance of businesses 
to open their books as the greatest impediments to a strong 
intermediating banking sector.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
CENTRAL BANK SETS OUT REFORMS TO IMPROVE INTERMEDIATION 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenia\'s banks do a poor job of attracting 
deposits and lending money:  the assets of Armenia\'s 19 
solvent banks equal only 17 percent of GDP (compared to 70 
percent in the U.S.).  We met recently with CBA Board Member 
Vache Gabrielyan to discuss the CBA\'s reform strategy to 
increase intermediation by raising the confidence of 
depositors in banks, and of banks in borrowers.  In 2004 the 
CBA will continue measures that force banks to be stronger 
combined with new legislation to strengthen creditor rights 
and a new deposit guarantee program.  The CBA will propose a 
draft law on the registration of collateral along with 
legislative amendments to allow non-judicial foreclosures in 
order to encourage collateral based lending.  Currently the 
difficulty of foreclosing on collateral, due to court 
inefficiencies and inadequate laws on collateral and secured 
transactions, discourages banks from lending to unknown 
borrowers. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
SOUNDER BANKS STILL MUST WORK TO ATTRACT DEPOSITS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (SBU) Over the last two years, the Central Bank 
strengthened the banking sector by liquidating insolvent 
banks and raising statutory capital requirements.  Even 
though banks are now sounder, they still must work to 
attract deposits.  As banks expand services and 
technologies, and as insolvent and uncompetitive banks are 
weeded out, Armenians should become more willing to save 
their money in banks.  Persistent, if unjustified, worries 
over the soundness of banks combined with privacy concerns 
and the fear of government monitoring keep much of Armenia\'s 
savings out of banks and in the cookie jar. 
 
------------------------- 
BANK LENDING REMAINS WEAK 
------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Banks are even worse at lending money than they are 
at attracting deposits:  the safest commercial banks like 
HSBC are flush with cash.  While businesses cite high 
interest rates (averaging  19 percent) as the primary 
obstacle to borrowing, banks cite the lack of good 
borrowers.  Nick Gilmore, the CEO of HSBC, comments that 
Armenian firms don\'t want to share their books with their 
banker.  \"Armenians keep several sets of books,\" he says, 
\"one for the tax authorities, one for their partners -- 
because they are all cheating their partners -- and one for 
their wives.  We want the real books and ultimately they 
don\'t want anyone to have real records.  They will offer 
collateral, but we are not in the collateral business.  We 
don\'t want property, we want to know our client.\" 
 
------------------------- 
TRUST, BUT HOW TO VERIFY? 
------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) In Armenia, knowing your client can be hard to do. 
In a culture where entrepreneurs look to family, clients and 
personal connections -- not banks -- for working capital, 
potential borrowers lack reliable financial records and 
adequate business plans.  The fact that many Armenians are 
paid in cash, have no bank accounts and have likely 
misrepresented their incomes on any government forms gives 
banks very little verifiable information on which to base 
decisions.  Banks lack expertise in evaluating risk anyway, 
and base their decisions on their own histories with clients 
rather than the clients\' ability to service the loans. 
 
--------------------------------- 
COMMENT: IT\'S A QUESTION OF TRUST 
--------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The greatest burdens on Armenia\'s banking sector 
are cultural.  Historical mistrust of banks persists and 
accurate bookkeeping is anathema to local businesses. 
(Note:  In 2003 Armenia had only 1 percent profit tax 
revenues despite 14 percent GDP growth.  End Note.) 
Paradoxically, potential borrowers would rather risk 
collateral than provide information:  Armenia\'s largest 
enterprises eschew borrowing from HSBC, the bank with the 
lowest lending interest rates.  Armenia is a cash economy, 
and people and businesses are reluctant to submit their 
accounts to scrutiny.  Banks understandably balk at lending 
money to consumers who keep no bank accounts and to 
businesses who show no profit.  The dearth of lending to 
small and medium size enterprises deprives banks of the 
broad portfolios, not mention experience and expertise, 
which would make lending at lower rates profitable.

Armenia\'s Central Bank froze the suspect account.  End

LOOTED TRUST FUND CASH ENDS UP IN YEREVAN 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Frankfurt\'s Secret Service liaison offices contacted 
Post after noon August 5 with urgent information about a 
fraudulent transfer of funds (USD 2.2 million) from a Bank of 
America (BofA) account in Los Angeles to accounts in Russia 
and Armenia, including roughly USD 1 million in Yerevan at 
the British HSBC bank.  The account holder, Ara Bostonjyan, 
has already withdrawn roughly USD 600,000. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
BofA APPARENTLY FAILS TO PROPERLY REQUEST FREEZE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (SBU) HSBC Yerevan CEO Nick Gilmour told us that his bank 
had automatically notified the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) 
of the large transfer of funds on Monday, August 2, as 
required by Armenian law.  He also noted that the Bank of 
America had contacted HSBC London to request the funds be 
frozen, at which time he had outlined the procedures 
necessary under Armenian law.  Gilmour noted that the Bank of 
America had not pursued the necessary legal channels, and 
simply had repeated their informal request the next day. 
(Note:  Armenian banks are required to make funds available 
for withdrawal within 24 hours to comply with a court order 
or if the CBA submits a written request for an injunction 
followed by a court order.  End Note.) 
 
-------------------------------------- 
EMBASSY ACTION FREEZES SUSPECT ACCOUNT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The Embassy and the National Security Service (NSS) 
are cooperating closely in this case.  Charge spoke 
personally with the Central Bank Chairman Vache Gabrielyan to 
request urgent CBA action to freeze this account pending a 
more formal request from appropriate USG agencies.  The 
Central Bank subsequently froze the account, preventing the 
withdrawal of USD 300,000. 
 
5. (C) While we succeeded in getting timely CBA support to 
freeze this account, this action is not permanent.  Unless we 
can provide appropriate documentation to the GOAM requesting 
a more permanent action, this step could be reversed.  The 
Armenian NSS has agreed to continue to surveil the account 
holder, but it would require significant effort and legal 
action before the disbursed funds could be recovered.

MINISTER OF DEFENSE REQUESTS DEFENSE ASSESSMENT 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenia formally requested a Defense 
Assessment in the following letter from the Minister 
of Defense Serzh Sargsian that his staff transmitted 
to the Embassy August 6.  The English-language text 
of the letter from the Minister of Defense follows. 
Begin Text: 
 
August 5, 2004 
 
To General James L. Jones 
Commander of the United States 
European Command 
 
Dear Mr. General, 
 
Let me inform you that the Ministry of Defense of 
the Republic of Armenia expresses its willingness to 
conduct Defense Assessment by Pentagon in the Armed 
Forces of the Republic of Armenia.  The Ministry of 
Defense proposes to conduct the assessment in the 
fields of communication, Air defense, NBC 
protection, military medicine, military education, 
operational and combat readiness, as well as in 
combat and training units. 
 
Taking into account that one of the primary areas of 
Armenian-American cooperation is peacekeeping, and 
Armenian side wishes to enlarge his capabilities in 
the mentioned area, therefore it is desirable to 
conduct Defense Assessment in the fields of 
Peacekeeping and Special Forces readiness. 
 
It is expedient to make a subject for assessment 
also the legislative field according to which the 
management and manning of the Armed Forces is 
realized both in peacetime, wartime and in crisis 
situations. 
 
At the same time I would like to note that according 
to the assessment standards that you have presented, 
the capabilities of the Armed Forces of RA relating 
to Nagorno Karabakh conflict and guaranteeing the 
existing military balance between the sides may not 
undergo assessment as far as the conflict still 
remains unsettled. 
 
I am hopeful that as a result of defense assessment 
the expected recommendations and assessment marks 
from American side will contribute to the gradual 
reforms in the Armed Forces of Armenia and will spur 
further enlargement and enhancement of Armenia- 
United States cooperation. 
 
Respectfully, 
 
/s/ 
 
Minister of Defense of the Republic of Armenia 
Serzh Sargsian

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Various ministries, state agencies, NGOs, 
educational institutions, and individuals submitted a number 
of new MCA proposals as a result of the consultative process 
initiated by the Government of Armenia (GOAM) in June.  The 
GOAM\'s MCA Board of Trustees (the Board) met July 19 and 
tasked GOAM ministries to discuss those MCA proposals 
related to their respective sectors and present a consensus- 
based unified proposal to the Ministry of Finance and 
Economy (MFE) by August 20, 2004.  MFE is charged to then 
summarize the proposals and present them to the MCA Board of 
Trustees no later than September 20, 2004.  The MFE plans to 
hold additional discussions with the authors of various 
proposals.  The GOAM anticipates that the final proposal to 
the MCC will be in one or both of the following areas: 
investments in human capital (education, health and social 
sectors); and/or rural infrastructure (roads, irrigation, 
dam construction, etc.).  Post obtained this information 
from GOAM MCA publications on its MCA website, and from 
remarks by MFE staff at a regular donor coordination 
meeting.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
USAID CHAIRS DONOR MEETING ON MCA 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) In response to high interest among the donor 
community on the government-initiated consultative process, 
USAID chaired a meeting on MCA in the framework of Yerevan\'s 
monthly donor-chaired coordination meetings.  We invited 
representatives from the MFE, including Armen Hayrapetyan, 
Head of Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) Coordination 
and Monitoring Department, and Hovhannes Azizyan, PRSP 
Secretary, to make a presentation and take questions.  The 
 
SIPDIS 
GOAM representatives stressed the Government\'s desire to 
link the MCA proposal to the PRSP, Armenia\'s approved 
strategy for poverty reduction and economic growth.  (Note: 
The PRSP is a comprehensive document developed in broad 
consultations with the public and reflects GOAM priorities 
in different sectors.  End Note.)  This presentation 
generated a debate on preferable mechanisms for public 
participation and the GOAM\'s ability to assemble the first 
draft program given the already wide differences in the 
scope and scale of proposals.  The necessity of broadening 
the public relations campaign and media coverage was also 
discussed. 
 
-------------------------- 
REGIONAL MEETINGS CONTINUE 
-------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The PRSP Secretariat continues to hold MCA 
consultative meetings in regions throughout Armenia. 
Compared to the MCA meetings organized by Marz (regional) 
administrations, the Secretariat\'s meetings are conducted in 
an informal environment to stimulate discussion and 
encourage feedback from the public.  Public response has 
been mixed:  some have complained that the GOAM has a 
predetermined agenda limited to identifying alternative 
sectors for proposals, while others have expressed an 
interest in seeing a more detailed GOAM plan with sectoral 
analyses and a well-developed rationale for choices. 
 
5. (SBU) MFE officials spoke about plans for August, which 
included meetings with five key NGO groups to further 
stimulate public involvement.  Since public understanding of 
the MCA will take time, the GOAM anticipates that the peak 
for proposal submissions will occur in August-September, 
possibly overloading the MFE\'s review and selection process. 
 
-------------------------- 
MEDIA INTEREST REMAINS LOW 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Despite the GOAM\'s expectations, media coverage of 
the MCA process remains relatively low.  (Note: Daily 
newspapers are currently on vacation.  End Note.) 
Information about the MCA appears on public television and 
in some newspapers but media coverage is not widespread. 
The MOFE relies heavily on its website 
(http://www.mfe.am/mfearweb/MCA/MCA.htm) as outreach.  The 
website (Armenian version) includes up-to-date information 
about MCA-related meetings and discussions, the status of 
proposals, and contact information.  The English-language 
website (http://www.mfe.am/mfeengweb/MCA/MCA.htm) is still 
relatively basic, but the MFE has promised it will soon fill 
it with translation of items on the more complete Armenian- 
language website.

2. (SBU) Summary.  A rising tide of dollars in the 
economy is forcing Armenia\'s Central Bank to choose 
between an appreciated local currency or increased 
inflation.  Although it is choosing to let the Dram 
rise, inflation nevertheless exceeds the 3 percent 
target.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
EXTRA DOLLARS DRIVE DRAM APPRECIATION 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Extra dollars are coming from both outside and 
inside the country, raising the value of the Dram 
against the dollar.  From inside, a significant 
increase in dollar-denominated commercial and consumer 
lending by banks has taken dollars from bank vaults and 
put them on the street.  Recent economic growth and 
better business expectations have attracted non-bank 
dollar savings from houses into investments.  From 
outside, foreign investments, remittances and private 
transfers, as well as tourism income have contributed 
to the expansion of the dollar supply. The Dram\'s rapid 
appreciation against the dollar, which makes exports 
uncompetitive and causes instability in the heavily 
dollarized economy, makes matters difficult for the 
CBA.  There is political pressure on the CBA to 
intervene to stabilize the Dram but it cannot put Drams 
on the market without further fueling inflation or 
raising interest rates, both undesirable. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
CENTRAL BANK UNLIKELY TO MEET INFLATION TARGET 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4. (SBU) Although the CBA decreased the real (Dram) 
money supply by 3 percent for the first half of 2004, 
the economy posted 7.6 percent year-on-year inflation, 
due to an expanding economy and increases in the price 
of imported staple goods.  Nerses Yeristyan, Advisor to 
the Chairman of the CBA, told us recently that meeting 
the inflation target of 3 percent is going to be \"a 
very difficult task.\"  The CBA claims that 50 percent 
of the money transactions in the economy are in 
currency other than the Dram, and are thus outside the 
CBA\'s control.  Whether or not political pressure 
forces the CBA to intervene to keep the Dram from 
appreciating, if will be difficult to meet the 3 
percent inflation target.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) In 2002, Armenia\'s National Assembly passed 
legislation creating a civilian board to monitor prison 
and police detention facilities and to subsequently 
issue a public report annually.  The Civil Society 
Monitoring Board (CSMB) finally began investigating 
prison conditions in Armenia in June.  The Board\'s 
initial prison visits noted poor conditions.  The CSMB 
plans to expand monitoring in the future, but it must 
still negotiate terms of access to prisons with police 
prison authorities.  The CSMB has no authority to 
insist on changes to prison policy, and must rely 
instead on its ombudsman role to advocate for change. 
End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
MONITORING BOARD 
---------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The Ministry of Justice accredited the eleven 
members of the Civil Society Monitoring Board in June, 
authorizing them to inspect prisons in Armenia without 
first notifying the Ministry.  This was the first step 
in implementing a 2002 law requiring the GOAM to 
establish a civilian board to report on conditions in 
prisons and police detention facilities.  The Board\'s 
members include representatives from ten Armenian NGOs 
and an Armenian Orthodox priest.  The Board met weekly 
for the past three months in anticipation of 
accreditation, has established a clear decision-making 
structure, and is currently organizing its monitoring 
tasks and its relations with the Ministry of Justice. 
NGOs have monitored Armenian prisons in the past, but 
Post has no knowledge of any similar attempt to fulfill 
the mandate of the 2002 law in such a comprehensive and 
systematic manner.  The OSCE facilitated the Board\'s 
formation and assists with ongoing training.  According 
to Mikael Aramyan, one of the Board members, the Board 
plans to recruit and train monitors nationwide 
beginning this fall. 
 
----------------------- 
CONDITIONS IN DETENTION 
----------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) According to Board members, conditions in 
Armenian prisons remain poor.  After three initial 
visits, they reported that some prisoners were able to 
purchase a few comforts, but the general prison 
population suffered under various forms of neglect. 
Most cells did not have toilets or running water, and 
prisoners did not have regular access to recreation or 
educational facilities.  Board members also noted that 
prisoners in pre-trial detention had difficulty 
communicating with the outside world and were not 
allowed visits by their families or lawyers in the 
first three days of detention.  According to CSMB 
members, conflicting regulations within the detention 
facilities created difficulties for prisoners wishing 
to mail letters, and visitors wishing to see family 
members faced long waits and irregular visitation 
hours.  Monitors reported that prison medical 
facilities were severely under-staffed, under-supplied 
and under-equipped.  Monitoring teams did not report 
the presence of widespread illness.  An OSCE observer 
who accompanied the CSMB on one prison visit reported 
that a prison warden cited insufficient funding as the 
reason for poor conditions.  The OSCE observer noted, 
however, that prison staff did not implement cost-free 
solutions such as posting a visitation schedule or 
regularly bringing water to all prisoners.  According 
to Board members, some prisoners reported that police 
had beaten them while in pre-trial detention, a 
systemic problem described by several human rights 
organizations over the years.

WHERE NEXT? 
----------- 
 
5. (SBU) The CSMB plans to visit all 13 of Armenia\'s 
prisons during the next year, issue its findings to the 
Ministry of Justice and the press simultaneously, and 
expand its efforts to include monitoring police 
detention centers.  They will face several significant 
challenges.  The group has no source of funding and has 
refused a GOAM offer to supply office space in the 
Ministry of Justice because members of the group fear 
compromising the Board\'s independence.  The CSMB still 
has to negotiate with the police to establish 
conditions under which it may monitor police detention 
facilities. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) OSCE staffers who have helped develop the CSMB 
told us that members of the group are determined, but 
still unsure of themselves.  Under the law, the Board 
has considerable rights to inspect and report on prison 
conditions, but CSMB members do not actively assert 
these rights.  They similarly lack confidence in 
negotiations with the national police, even though the 
law states the police must allow inspections.  An OSCE 
member who has trained the CSMB and similar groups in 
the CIS told us that the CSMB has so far proven more 
cohesive and independent than monitoring boards in 
either Georgia or Azerbaijan, but it is too early to 
determine if the Board will live up to its potential.

A TEST FOR PFP 
-------------- 
 
1. (C) GOAM senior policy makers are looking to the upcoming 
Cooperation Best Effort 2004 (CBE04) Partnership for Peace 
(PfP) mid-September exercise in Azerbaijan as a test case for 
whether NATO, PfP members and the U.S. genuinely want to work 
with Armenia.  Until the five Armenian military officers who 
have requested visas at the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tbilisi 
receive their visas and are allowed to take part in the 
exercise, GOAM senior officials from the President to the 
Foreign Minister will continue to present this as a clear-cut 
test of NATO\'s will. 
 
------------------------------- 
NO CBE04 WITHOUT THE ARMENIANS? 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) GOAM officials point to the fact that they allowed 
Turkey to participate in CBE03 exercises in Armenia (and 
invited Azerbaijan as well) and note that they expect the 
U.S. and its NATO allies to pressure Azerbaijan into allowing 
Armenian participation in CBE04. 
 
------------------------------------ 
CLOSER ARMENIAN MILITARY COOPERATION 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) In recent months, Armenia has shown important signs 
that it is considering closer engagement on defense issues; 
the GOAM is developing its Individual Partnership Action Plan 
(IPAP) and agreed to a Defense Assessment on August 5. 
Armenian officials lead us to believe that if CBE04 goes 
forward without Armenian participation we can expect serious 
disenchantment with both NATO and PfP.

SUBJECT: COURT HALTS RATIFICATION OF ROME STATUTE -- 
ARTICLE 98 MAY HAVE TO WAIT

Classified By: CDA A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Armenia still hopes to ratify the Article 98 
Agreement when the National Assembly returns from recess in 
September.  We pressed FM Oskanian to keep to this timetable, 
but he said that the Constitutional Court is now reviewing 
the agreement and may decide that it would be unlawful to 
ratify the agreement until Armenia ratifies the Rome Statute. 
  We pressed Oskanian to de-link the two agreements, since we 
understand it may take some time for the Rome Statute to make 
its way to the parliament. Oskanian agreed to explore this 
option.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) On August 12, CDA met with Foreign Minister Vartan 
Oskanian to to underscore the USG\'s strong view that the 
Article 98 agreement with Armenia should be ratified as soon 
as possible.  We noted U/S Bolton\'s recent personal 
engagement (ref) and asked how the GOAM saw this issue 
proceeding. 
 
3.  (C) Oskanian said that he recognized the importance of 
the Agreement to the USG and appreciated U/S Bolton\'s 
personal involvement.  The GOAM continues to hope that the 
National Assembly will ratify the Agreement early in the 
autumn session.  Because the Agreement contains language 
referring to the Rome Statute, it may be unlawful to ratify 
the document until the Rome Statute itself has been ratified, 
Oskanian explained. 
 
4.  (C) The Government\'s strategy had been to move the Rome 
Statute and the Article 98 Agreement to the parliament 
together, said Oskanian.  But according to Oskanian, the GOAM 
finds the Statute to be \"problematic in many ways\" and the 
Constitutional Court is reviewing whether the Rome Statute 
can be forwarded to the parliament at all.  We pressed 
Oskanian to try to de-link the two documents; the USG wants 
to count Armenia among those countries which have both signed 
and ratified an Article 98 agreement. 
 
5.  (C) Although Armenia signed the Rome Statute in 1998, 
President Kocharian waited until July 15 to ask the 
Constitutional Court to review whether the parliament could 
ratify the Statute.  On August 13, the Court ruled that the 
Statute is unconstitutional and that five articles of 
Armenia\'s constitution would have to be amended before it 
could be ratified. 
 
6.  (C) On August 13, Deputy Foreign Minister Tatul Margaryan 
told CDA that the GOAM had pointed out the potential problem 
when negotiating test of the Agreement, but the U.S. side 
insisted on a specific reference to the Rome Statute.  He was 
pessimistic about prospects for de-linking the two 
agreements.

SUBJECT: MINIKES IN YEREVAN: ENGAGE WITH THE OSCE 
 
Classified By: CDA A.F. Godfrey for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) In a series of intense meetings with nearly all of 
Armenia\'s top-level leaders, USOSCE Ambassador Stephan M. 
Minikes called for Armenia to engage with the OSCE to make 
sure the organization suits the country\'s needs, and not to 
carp from the sidelines, eroding OSCE basic principles. 
Minikes pressed for further engagement with the Minsk Group; 
resolution of regional conflicts would do more for Armenia\'s 
economy than any assistance program.  In a wide-ranging 
discussion with the Foreign Minister, Ambassador Minikes 
urged Armenia to find its place in Europe.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
WHERE IS ARMENIA GOING? 
----------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) During a brief visit to Armenia from August 11 to 
13, USOSCE Ambassador Minikes met with Deputy Speaker of the 
National Assembly Vahan Hovhanissyan, Foreign Minister Vartan 
Oskanian and President Robert Kocharian.  He also met with a 
group of Armenia\'s opposition leaders and with the OSCE 
Mission in Armenia.  In all of his meetings, Ambassador 
Minikes stressed the importance of engaging the OSCE to 
ensure the organization\'s actions meet Armenia\'s needs.  He 
told Armenia\'s leaders that the \"unhelpful\" statement which 
came out of the Moscow CIS Summit sought to erode the 
organization\'s principles and, hence, was unacceptable. 
 
3. (C) In an extended, frank meeting with the Foreign 
minister, Ambassador Minikes encouraged Foreign Minister 
Vartan Oskanian to \"make your voices heard\" more as a part of 
the international community and to use the OSCE to attain 
\"the goals you\'ve established for yourself.\"  The Ambassador 
then asked, \"Where is Armenia going?\"  Oskanian, agreeing 
that the Caucasus has to \"belong somewhere,\" argued that \"the 
only possible place (Armenia) can belong is in Europe.\" 
Oskanian noted that all of Armenia\'s historical and cultural 
roots are in Europe, and that it was only logical that 
Armenia should work closely with the Council of Europe (CoE) 
and the European Union (EU).  Eventually, Oskanian told the 
Ambassador, \"We want to belong to the EU.\" 
 
------------------------ 
\"COMPLEMENTARITY\" IS KEY 
------------------------ 
 
4. (C) The essence of Armenia\'s foreign policy, according to 
Oskanian, is \"complementarity.\"  Armenians are smart enough, 
he commented, to \"choose between a good apple and a bad 
apple\" but Armenians are also \"smart enough to know which is 
the available apple.\"  Geography is a clear limitation, 
Oskanian argued, and Armenia will not put itself into a 
position where it must \"choose between Russia and the U.S.\" 
Clearly Armenia is a Western country, Oskanian maintained, 
and Armenia\'s preferences lie in the West.  Armenia\'s 
direction and post-Soviet development confirm that it is 
growing closer to the West, and he noted the importance of 
Armenia becoming a beneficiary of the process of expanding 
the EU. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
THE U.S. AND EU SHOULD URGE TURKEY TO OPEN THE BORDER 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
5. (C) Lamenting that he doesn\'t think \"Powell or Armitage 
raise the Turkey issue forcefully enough,\" Oskanian noted 
that as long as the border with Turkey is closed Armenia will 
have to maintain its current close relationship with Russia. 
Turkey\'s eventual accession to the EU, he said, would be \"the 
best thing that ever happened to Armenia,\" -- as long as the 
EU does not \"cut corners\" but insists that Turkey have normal 
ties with all of its neighbors including opening its border 
with Armenia.  Oskanian claimed that when he first met with 
Turkish FM Gul he saw \"genuine acceptance\" of the possibility 
for an open border, but that the Azeris had scuttled any 
possibility of de-linking settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict and opening the border. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
RUSSIAN INFLUENCE: \"NYET\" ON EU; \"DA\" ON NATO 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Emphasizing Armenian foreign policy\'s independence 
from Russia on any issues that involve the EU, Oskanian noted 
that, \"Russia doesn\'t have a say on EU; but on NATO I would 
listen.  On NATO, because of our military cooperation with 
Russia and the Russian bases, we have to be more considerate.\" 
-------------------------------- 
WESTERN INSTITUTIONS \"GUIDED US\" 
-------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) Oskanian emphasized the importance of the OSCE and 
CoE in the immediate post-Soviet period, noting that the 
institutions \"guided us\" as Armenia was redefining itself as 
a democracy and reorienting itself toward the West.  Oskanian 
clearly values the role the OSCE and CoE play as they help 
keep reforms on track in Armenia. 
 
---------------------------- 
KOCHARIAN PESSIMISTIC ON N-K 
---------------------------- 
8. (C) Ambassador Minikes\' exchange with President Kocharian 
was cordial and lasted more than an hour.  Kocharian defended 
his decision to sign the CIS-backed statement, and complained 
at length about \"slanted\" OSCE election monitoring.  He 
seemed unable to leave the subject of what criteria ODIHR 
employed in making judgements about whether or not Armenia\'s 
elections met \"standards\" and complained that Armenia was 
never given any.  \"What standards,\" he kept asking. 
Ambassador Minikes said that Armenia\'s OSCE Vienna delegation 
was quite experto on OSCE matters and could get very clear 
answers to the President\'s questions but nonetheless offered 
to facilicate getting ODIHR to be more transparent if, 
indeed, that was desired by Armenia, and needed.  Kocharian 
resisted going into detail on the status of discussions on 
N-K, but was broadly pessimistic about near-term prospects. 
In response to the Ambassador\'s questions, President 
Kocharian said that Aliyev is not committed to the peace 
process, \"Aliyev the son does not have enough of the 
statesman in him\" to reach a settlement now or in the 
immediate future.  \"It just won\'t happen\" now, said 
Kocharian.  \"Maybe someday,\" he added. 
 
9. (U) Ambassador Minikes has cleared this telegram.

language text of the letter follows.  Begin Text: 
 
July 29, 2004 
Yerevan, Armenia 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Armenia presents its compliments to the Embassy of the 
United States of America in Yerevan and has the honor 
to inform that the Government of Armenia has decided to 
present its candidature to the Commission on Crime 
Prevention and Criminal Justice for the period 2006- 
2008 at the elections to be held during the 
organizational session of ECOSOC in April-May, 2005 in 
New York. 
 
The Government of Armenia attaches utmost importance to 
uncompromising fight against crime in all its 
manifestations, especially the organized crime and 
terrorism and has embraced an ambitious agenda to 
ensure the rule of law and criminal justice in the 
country.  The Government of Armenia has adopted 
decisive anti-corruption and anti-human trafficking 
strategy programs.  Armenia is an active participant to 
various regional organizations and projects aimed at 
fighting terrorism, corruption and transnational 
organized crime.  By presenting its candidature to 
CCPCJ Armenia expects to gain an opportunity for 
cooperation in the field of crime prevention and 
criminal justice for the benefit of [the] wider 
international community. 
 
The Government of Armenia hopes that in the spirit of 
friendly relations and mutual cooperation existing 
between the two countries, the US Government will be in 
a position to extend its valuable support to the 
candidature of Armenia. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Armenia avails itself of this opportunity to renew to 
the Embassy of the United States of America in Yerevan 
the assurances of its highest consideration.

LABOR VERY RARE

1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenia\'s constitution prohibits child labor, and 
the use of children in the workforce is very rare.  The high 
demand for jobs, especially for unskilled workers, and the 
cultural premium on family and education make it very 
unlikely that employers would give valuable jobs to 
children.  While conventional bonded or slave child labor is 
not a problem in Armenia, the government has taken steps to 
protect all women from trafficking and sexual exploitation 
in response to recent reports of trafficking for 
prostitution (ref B).  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
ARMENIAN LAW PROHIBITS CHILD LABOR 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenian law provides for solid protection against 
child labor.  Children under the age of 18 may not work at 
night, more than six hours at a time, or in difficult or 
dangerous jobs, even in family businesses.  Children may 
work without a permit from the age of 16.  Children 14 and 
older may only work with permission of a medical commission 
and the local labor union board.  Armenia\'s Constitutional 
Court has approved ILO Convention 182 for ratification and 
Armenia will likely accede during the Fall 2004 legislative 
session.  The convention\'s provisions are nonetheless 
already part of Armenian Labor Code and the Law on 
Children\'s Rights, which prohibits child employment that may 
endanger their health, physical or mental development, or 
may interfere with their education. 
 
----------------------------- 
LITTLE DEMAND FOR CHILD LABOR 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) That there has been no prosecution of a case of 
child labor is more a testament to child labor\'s rarity than 
to the lack of enforcement.  The Department of Women, Family 
and Children within the Ministry of Labor is charged to 
enforce the Child Protection Law.  Local representatives of 
UNICEF told us that the department\'s primary concern was 
adoptions and guardianship issues, and that child labor is 
not a significant concern.  We have visited many of the 
major industrial enterprises and farms in Armenia and have 
seen no evidence of child labor.  Rather, the low 
availability of jobs, especially for the unskilled, means 
that factory or farm managers are unlikely to give valuable 
jobs to children. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
ARMENIA IS MAKING EFFORTS TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (SBU) Government efforts to investigate and prosecute 
trafficking offenses are both at an all-time high for 
Armenia (ref B).  Although none of the known trafficking 
cases involve minors, there is anecdotal evidence that 
traffickers have targeted underage girls in Armenia\'s 
orphanages.  With international assistance, the GOAM has 
trained its worldwide consular staff to recognize 
trafficking and has collaborated with police in destination 
countries to apprehend traffickers.  Local NGOs have 
launched a media campaign to educate poor communities about 
trafficking and sexual exploitation and also have 
established a hotline to connect victims with community 
assistance groups.  We expect the government to maintain its 
heightened attention to this issue and continue to take 
steps to more effectively prevent and prosecute trafficking- 
related offenses. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
COMMENT: CHILD LABOR NOT PART OF THE CULTURE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Armenians value highly both family and education: 
UNICEF reports that only 6 percent of children under 18 do 
not attend school.  Although poverty, the lack of transport, 
and the lack of medical attention to children with special 
needs may keep some children -- especially in rural areas -- 
idle and out of school, Armenian culture would not tolerate 
keeping children from school to take valuable jobs that 
adults are waiting to fill.  While some children doubtless 
work in family businesses, bonded or arduous labor by 
children is unheard of in Armenia.  Recent efforts to 
protect all women from trafficking and sexual exploitation 
include public education targeting minor girls in vulnerable 
populations.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Ambassador Evans presented copies of his letters of 
credence to Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian August 
23.  The Ambassador highlighted the strong U.S.-Armenia 
bilateral relationship, outlined U.S. policy objectives, and 
noted that new opportunities may exist in the South Caucasus 
and the broader region.  Oskanian agreed that the 
U.S.-Armenia relationship was strong, and suggested that he 
and the Ambassador immediately move to a first-name basis -- 
a suggestion that Ambassador Evans welcomed.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
\"DIPLOMACY IS A GAME OF INCHES\" 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In a brief introductory call on August 23, Ambassador 
Evans met with Foreign Minister Oskanian to present copies of 
his letters of credence.  Formal presentation of credentials 
is expected to take place in early September, when President 
Kocharian returns to Armenia. 
 
3. (C) Quoting Deputy Secretary Armitage\'s comment that 
\"diplomacy is a game of inches,\" Ambassador Evans noted that 
he wanted to build on the already strong relationship and to 
further the USG\'s main goals of promoting regional stability 
and security, promoting prosperity, and developing democratic 
institutions.  We have some very significant opportunities, 
Ambassador Evans continued.  Within our bilateral 
relationship we already have established strong ties through 
our assistance, we have new prospects for increasing defense 
cooperation and for additional opportunities through the 
Millennium Challenge Account.  Ambassador Evans also 
discussed the USG sense that there may be some new 
opportunities for change in the South Caucasus, including new 
partners with whom to work in Georgia, and we want to see the 
entire region prosper.  Finally, Ambassador Evans commented, 
we have new winds blowing in the Middle East.  He welcomed 
the Armenian contribution to the Coalition efforts in Iraq. 
 
------------------------------ 
\"FEEL FREE TO CALL ME ANYTIME\" 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Urging Ambassador Evans to feel free to call him 
directly anytime, even at home, the Minister urged the 
Ambassador to move to a first-name basis.  Oskanian agreed 
that, \"The goals you\'ve outlined are the ones we want: 
stability, peace and prosperity.\"  He continued that while a 
great deal had been done, the most difficult tasks were still 
ahead.  On democracy, Oskanian noted, \"We\'ve barely scratched 
the surface.\"  Since 1994 the region has enjoyed the benefits 
of a cease-fire, but now both sides need to work to make a 
\"real peace.\"  Oskanian noted that he\'ll be meeting with 
Azerbaijan\'s FM in Prague at the end of August and that 
Presidents Kocharian and Aliyev will meet in Astana in 
September.  Oskanian will continue his talks with Turkish FM 
Gul, and expressed appreciation for U.S. efforts to date to 
urge Turkey to normalize its relationship with Armenia. 
Oskanian emphasized Armenia\'s desire to see Turkey de-link 
the closed border from a solution to N-K, Ambassador Evans 
noted that we needed to encourage everyone to think in 
broader terms. 
 
------------ 
A WARM START 
------------ 
 
5. (C) Foreign Minister Oskanian changed his travel plans in 
order to be able to receive Ambassador Evans on his first 
working day in Yerevan -- a strong signal that he and the 
Armenian government continue to place a high premium on good 
relations with the U.S. and on cordial personal relations 
between the Foreign Minister and the U.S. Ambassador.

JOURNALIST ALLEGEDLY ATTACKED 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) On August 24, two investigative journalists 
alleged that they had been threatened and one of them 
roughed up by unidentified men after they had 
photographed the luxury home of the Deputy Chief of 
Armenia\'s National Police.  The journalists, Anna 
Israelian and Mkhitar Khachatrian told the press they 
photographed Deputy Chief Armen Yeritsian\'s house as 
part of a report on environmental damage caused by 
house construction.  While touring an expensive 
residential area, the journalists took a picture of 
Yeritsian\'s house, despite a warning from a guard who 
stood in front. 
 
3. (SBU) According to the journalists, later that day 
the same guard accompanied by several other men 
approached them at a cafe.  Khachatrian said the men 
roughed him up and threatened to kill him if he didn\'t 
back down.  Khachatrian surrendered the photo card from 
his digital camera.  (Note:  Khachatrian suffered 
bruises and scratches that did not require 
hospitalization.  End Note.) 
 
4. (SBU) According to press accounts, Khachatrian 
described his attackers as \"the same type of men\" who 
attacked photojournalists at two rallies in April 
(reftel).  Israelian, who was one of the journalists 
attacked on April 5, told the press that she would not 
lodge a formal police complaint because of the 
\"ineffectiveness\" of the April investigation. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
PRESS CLUB WILL WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The Union of Journalists and the Yerevan Press 
Club publicly denounced the attack.  We spoke with 
Boris Navasardyan, the president of the Yerevan Press 
Club who stated that a local media advocacy group wrote 
a letter to the Prosecutor General\'s office in June 
complaining about the recent attacks on journalists, 
and he noted that this most recent attack would become 
part of the discussion.  He told us that the advocacy 
group, known as the Media Working Group, plans to hold 
meetings with top law enforcement officials in the 
second half of September to discuss methods of 
preventing and effectively prosecuting the perpetrators 
of such attacks.  Post will continue to monitor the 
statements of the Media Working Group and the reception 
its concerns receive from law enforcement.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) The three parties of the pro-government ruling 
coalition forwarded a package of proposed constitutional 
amendments to Armenia\'s National Assembly (NA) in mid-August 
for discussion and approval during the upcoming legislative 
session.  This step was the latest in the continuing saga of 
Council of Europe (CoE)-mandated constitutional modifications 
-- via nationwide referendum -- that the GOAM wants to 
complete before the CoE\'s June 2005 deadline.  The package 
proposes, inter alia, prolonging parliamentary terms of 
office to five years, reducing the number of parliamentarians 
elected in single-mandate districts and removing the current 
ban on dual citizenship.  Early reactions by opposition 
parliamentarians suggest that debate over the package will 
dominate the upcoming legislative season and could become the 
opposition\'s next rallying point.  While far from leveling 
the playing field between the executive and legislative 
branches, the proposed amendments, and a promised public 
discussion of their merits and shortcomings, have the 
potential for positive impact.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
COALITION APPLAUDS AMENDMENTS AS THEY MOVE TO NA 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2. (C) The three parties of the pro-government ruling 
coalition forwarded a package of proposed constitutional 
amendments to Armenia\'s National Assembly in mid-August. 
This step was the latest in the continuing saga of 
CoE-mandated constitutional modifications -- via nationwide 
referendum -- that the GOAM wants to complete before the 
CoE\'s June 2005 deadline.  This is the second time the GOAM 
has pushed for constitutional amendments.  The previous 
referendum, held in tandem with the 2003 parliamentary 
elections, failed to garner enough votes to be adopted 
(reftel).  Local sources close to the CoE told us August 26 
that the \"jury was still out\" on whether the current package 
would satisfy Armenia\'s commitments and that they expected 
there would be substantial revisions before the package was 
passed by the NA and ready for a referendum. 
 
3. (SBU) Coalition representatives, including Armenian 
Revolutionary Federation (ARF - \"Dashnaksutiun\") leader Armen 
Rustamyan, publicly endorsed the package soon after its 
release.  National Assembly Deputy Speaker Tigran Torosian 
(Republican Party) made no secret during recent interviews 
with the press that the amendments enjoyed the parliamentary 
leadership\'s full support as well as that of President 
Kocharian.  According to Torosian and others, Kocharian held 
a closed-door meeting with coalition parliamentary leaders in 
early August to make a push for the amendments and their 
quick passage through parliament. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
PACKAGE CUTS SEATS, EXTENDS TERMS IN PARLIAMENT 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (U) The latest package of amendments, while varying 
slightly from the 2003 version, proposes more than fifty 
changes to Armenia\'s constitution.  The most important -- and 
most controversial -- amendments would reduce the number of 
parliamentarians in Armenia\'s National Assembly from 131 to 
121 by limiting the number of NA deputies representing 
single-mandate districts.  (Note:  Armenia\'s NA is a mix of 
deputies elected from a party list and those representing 
local consitutencies.  End Note)  At the same time, the 
amendments would lengthen parliamentarians\' terms of office 
from four to five years.  (Note:  Despite speculation in the 
press earlier this summer, the amendments did not propose a 
similar extension for presidential terms of office or term 
limits.  End Note.) 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
DUAL CITIZENSHIP, EXPANDED ROLE OF OMBUDSMAN 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Among the other notable changes proposed by the 
amendment package is a reversal of Article 14 in Armenia\'s 
current constitution that prohibits dual citizenship.  While 
stipulating a special law to regulate the nuances of dual 
citizenship, the amendment package makes reference to 
Armenia\'s diaspora and the need for dual citizenship given 
the presence of so many Armenians abroad.  (Note:  The ARF 
had vigorously fought against dual citizenship in the past 
but, in its relatively new role as part of the governing 
coalition, appears to have relented and has remained quiet on 
this particular provision.  ARF representatives have hinted 
to us that their party\'s extensive funding from diaspora 
sources helped push them into this more conciliatory stance. 
End Note.) 
 
6. (U) Armenia\'s Human Rights Ombudsman would enjoy an 
expanded role under the amended constitution.  Following 
intense criticism by international human rights groups, the 
amended constitution would mandate the Ombudsman\'s 
appointment by the legislature instead of by the president. 
In addition, the amendments grant the Ombudsman new authority 
to refer laws to the Constitutional Court for revision. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
TENTATIVE REFERENDUM DATES AND OPPOSITION GRUMBLING 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7. (SBU) GOAM representatives have predicted easy passage of 
the amendments by the legislature and have even gone so far 
as to suggest a July 5, 2005 date for the nationwide 
referendum.  (Note:  This date is the tenth anniversary of 
Armenia\'s current constitution and some analysts predict the 
GOAM will appeal to Armenians\' patriotism to vote in favor of 
the package by scheduling the vote on this day.  End Note.) 
Opposition leaders, however, have already begun criticizing 
the package and pledging to reject it should it come to a 
vote.  Opposition Justice bloc leaders Aram Sargsyan and 
Victor Dalakian made joint calls for parliamentarians to vote 
against the amendments, calling them \"cosmetic changes 
proposed by an illegitimate president.\"  In a surprise move, 
however, opposition leader Artashes Geghamian has made more 
conciliatory statements in public and has reportedly hinted 
in private that he might return to parliament in order to 
discuss the amendments. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
NEXT STEPS:  VENICE COMMISSION AND PACE WILL WEIGH-IN 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
8. (C) The next substantive step for the constitutional 
amendments package will be review by the Council of Europe\'s 
Venice Commission.  Sources close to the commission told us 
August 26 that the amendments are already under review even 
though Armenia\'s National Assembly has not yet formally 
forwarded them outside Yerevan.  The parliamentary elections 
significantly overshadowed the Venice Commission\'s commentary 
on the amendments package in 2003, and analysts predict that 
its recommendations will by default find a more prominent 
role in the process this time around.  While still early, 
private indications by commission bureaucrats suggest that 
the commission will not cite fundamental flaws in this latest 
amendments package but will prescribe and carefully 
scrutinize a broad consultative process leading up to a 
future referendum.  The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council 
of Europe (PACE) will include debate over the constitutional 
amendments early this Fall.  Local politicians expect 
discussions at PACE to be highly charged and unlikely to 
concentrate on the substance of the amendments package. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9. (SBU) During August, traditionally Armenia\'s slowest month 
for news of political events, it is no surprise that the 
proposed constitutional amendments have dominated public 
debate over recent weeks.  In stark contrast to the approach 
in 2003 (reftel), this set of amendments already enjoys the 
public support of pro-Kocharian forces who approached the 
topic ambivalently during the previous parliamentary 
election.  Now that the package has Kocharian\'s stamp of 
approval, it seems likely that the opposition will cling to 
the issue as its new rallying point -- whether or not it ends 
its months-long boycott of parliament -- in what has the 
potential to be a divisive set of debates once the National 
Assembly reconvenes next month. 
 
10. (C) While falling short of leveling the playing field 
between Armenia\'s executive and legislative branches, the 
proposed constitutional amendments are more than merely 
cosmetic, despite the claims of some opposition leaders.  The 
modest structural changes will significantly add to the 
legitimacy -- both perceived and actual -- of the Human 
Rights Ombudsman and will grant Armenians broader access to 
the Constitutional Court.  These steps are not comprehensive, 
but represent an important start.  GOAM-promised public 
debate of the amendments has the potential to engage civil 
society in a positive way.  As this is the first time 
politicians have linked their political identities to 
constitutional amendments, however, it will be tempting for 
some to muscle the amendments through parliament in a rush. 
The GOAM will show its serious commitment to the constitution 
if it lets the debate run its course over the next few 
months.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) GOAM Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) 
Secretariat Coordinator Hovik Azizyan confirmed to us during 
 
SIPDIS 
an informal meeting August 25 that the GOAM had pushed back 
its planned proposal submission schedule.  Azizyan said the 
change was necessary due to the large number of proposed 
projects and activities stimulated by the local MCA 
consultative process.  The MFE expects that the MCA Board of 
Trustees will be able to consider the MFE submission and 
submit a first draft of the MCA Board\'s Compact proposal to 
the MCC (with at least priority directions/sectors defined) 
by the end of September 2004.  The GOAM then intends to 
invite the MCC representatives to Armenia to discuss the 
draft proposal.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
ARMENIANS LOOKING FORWARD TO INFO FROM \"LESSONS LEARNED\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2. (SBU) We met with Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) 
PRSP Secretariat Coordinator Hovik Azizyan August 24 to 
discuss the MCA consultative process and prospects for the 
GOAM\'s compact proposal.  Azizyan\'s comments indicated that 
the GOAM continued to focus on the MCA process even during 
the August vacation season and despite the absence of the 
MFE Deputy Minister who oversees these issues.  Azizyan was 
aware of the upcoming meeting between MCC representatives 
and Senior Presidential Economic Advisor Vahram Nercissiantz 
scheduled for August 27.  He said that the GOAM looked 
forward to hearing from the MCC about \"lessons learned\" from 
compact proposals already submitted by eligible countries. 
He acknowledged that any new information stemming from the 
August 27 meeting may affect the expected timing and/or 
substance of the GOAM\'s MCA Compact proposal. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
PROPOSALS CONTINUE TO STREAM IN FROM THE PUBLIC 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (SBU) The MFE continues to sort through numerous activity 
proposals generated by the MCA consultative process. 
Azizyan clarified that, following an initial cataloging and 
vetting by the MFE, the proposals are forwarded to the 
appropriate GOAM ministry for review and comment.  The line 
ministries will then submit a summarized and rank-ordered 
version of all proposals to the MCA Board of Trustees no 
later than September 20, 2004.   To accomplish this, the MFE 
had hoped to receive combined sector-specific proposals from 
the various ministries and other state agencies by August 
20, 2004. 
 
4. (SBU) According to Azizyan, several GOAM ministries and 
other state agencies have not yet submitted their combined 
proposals to the MFE, due mostly to the unexpectedly large 
number of proposals received from the public.  According to 
the GOAM official, over 300 activity proposals have been 
received to date, and the escalating public interest in the 
MCA program probably would generate a significant number of 
new proposals before the GOAM\'s September 1, 2004 closing 
date for proposal submissions. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
PROPOSALS FROM HI-TECH, ENVIRONMENTAL SECTORS SURPRISE GOAM 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The current proposal review process has revealed a 
greater level of interest in activities in the high 
technology and environmental sectors than was predicted 
earlier.  These sectors, in addition to the project areas 
identified early on in the consultative process (education, 
health and other social sectors, roads, irrigation, dam 
construction, etc.) appear to be modifying the GOAM\'s 
approach to the issue.  Azizyan told us that the MFE is 
contemplating how it might add activities in these sectors 
to its eventual MCA compact proposal.  He also noted that 
the MFE is discussing ways to consider the varying sectoral 
needs of each region when consolidating the proposals. 
(Comment:  The need to be responsive to needs at the 
regional level has been a constant theme throughout the 
consultative process in Armenia\'s rural areas.  This idea is 
clearly filtering up through the GOAM bureaucracy as well as 
the sense that a compact proposal that does not enjoy the 
support of the regional governments will pose problems for 
the GOAM.  End Comment.) 
 
6. (SBU) Azizyan also mentioned that the GOAM is concerned 
about the problem of potential negative reactions from 
groups whose proposals are ultimately not included in the 
final MCA Compact proposal.  The high number and scope of 
proposals received already exceeds any amount that the GOAM 
believes Armenia can reasonably expect to receive under the 
MCA program.  To address this, Azizyan said the GOAM intends 
to keep the public informed regarding the current status of 
proposals through various channels such as its website.  He 
also said the GOAM would engage individuals or groups whose 
proposals were not included in a future compact with a full 
briefing on the GOAM\'s decision-making criteria. 
 
---------------- 
TIMETABLE SHIFTS 
---------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Azizyan said the MFE now expects to receive the 
combined sector-level input from various ministries by 
August 31.  Nonetheless, the MFE\'s own timetable for its 
summarized and combined submission to the MCA the Board of 
Trustees remains the same (September 20).  The MFE also 
expects that the MCA Board of Trustees will be able to 
consider the MFE submission and submit a first draft of the 
MCA Board\'s Compact proposal to the MCC (with at least 
priority directions/sectors defined) by the end of September 
2004.  The GOAM then intends to invite the MCC 
representatives to Armenia to discuss the draft proposal. 
Pending positive feedback from the MCC, the second phase of 
the consultative process will be initiated and the final 
version incorporating public feedback will be submitted to 
the MCC.

U.S. AMBASSADOR 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  On August 23, the Ambassador swore in 51 
new Peace Corps Volunteers for service in Armenia, the 
largest group since the program was established in 
1992.  Foreign Minister Oskanian, who attended the 
ceremony, spoke passionately about the high value of 
the program for Armenia and U.S. - Armenia relations. 
Virtually every media outlet in the country widely and 
positively covered the ceremony, which included 
Armenian-language performances from new Volunteers. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  In his first public act since arriving in Armenia 
on August 21, the Ambassador swore in the 12th group of 
Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) to serve in Armenia. 
This new crop of 51 brings the total number of PCVs on 
active service to 90.  The group will serve in all four 
of Peace Corps Armenia\'s programs:  Teaching English as 
a Foreign Language, Community Health Education, 
Community Business Development and Environmental 
Education.  Before administering the oath, the 
Ambassador thanked the volunteers for their service, 
congratulated them on completing three months of 
vigorous in-country orientation and safety training, 
and charged them with being good U.S. Ambassadors to 
the various town and villages where they will serve. 
 
3. Attendance at the event was impressive.  In addition 
to FM Oskanian, Minister of Education Sergo Yeritsyan 
and representatives from the Ministries of Trade and 
Economic Development, Health Care, and Nature 
Protection, were present the ceremony. 
 
4.  FM Oskanian conveyed a message of appreciation from 
RA President Robert Kocharian, and expressed particular 
enthusiasm regarding the program.  He said that 
Armenians had much to learn from PCVs, simply by virtue 
of their presence, as they give up their own material 
comforts to serve others and advocate volunteerism as a 
rewarding experience.  He noted that he himself felt 
like a PCV when he made the decision to leave the U.S. 
and return to Armenia following its independence. 
 
5.  As part of the very public event, PCVs demonstrated 
the Armenian language skills they had gained during 
their eleven weeks of training by giving speeches, 
reciting a well-known Armenian poem and singing a 
classic Armenian song.  Predictably, the volunteers won 
over the Armenian audience with their display of 
recognition for the value of Armenian culture. 
 
-------------- 
Press Coverage 
-------------- 
 
6. Virtually every media outlet widely and positively 
covered the swearing-in ceremony.  As this was his 
first public event, all eyes were focused on the 
Ambassador. 
 
7. The combination of a warm event attended by high- 
level GOAM officials, fresh-faced PCVs quoting Armenian 
poets, and the debut of the new U.S. Ambassador who 
peppered his speech with Armenian phrases, generated a 
full 24 hours of extremely positive coverage for Peace 
Corps and U.S. assistance in Armenia.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Trade in the most basic goods in the Armenian 
economy is controlled by a small number of oligarchs with 
strong ties to government.  While it is considered common 
knowledge that oligarchs use political power and their 
dominant market position to keep competitors at bay, there 
is little political will to investigate or regulate these 
businesses under Armenia\'s competition law.  The 
government\'s fledgling State Commission for Protection of 
Economic Competition (the Commission) is not yet strong 
enough to successfully tackle the goliaths who control basic 
commodities.  The Commission has taken on small cases and 
the unpopular Armentel telephone monopoly (ref A), Armenian 
consumers and would-be competitors are the losers as basic 
goods remain subject to the control of a few.  Until the 
GOAM is willing to address the corruption throughout 
government which allows the oligarchs to control their 
markets, they will continue to gouge Armenia\'s most 
vulnerable consumers, the poor.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
OLIGOPOLIES IN FOOD, GAS AND CIGARETTES 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) While the empires controlled by Armenia\'s oligarchs 
are insignificant when compared to those in Russia, they 
have managed to amass impressive holdings by controlling 
access to basic goods, like wheat, sugar, salt butter, 
gasoline, beer and cigarettes (ref B).  Key to their ability 
to control much of the supply of these staple goods are 
close relationships with powerful government actors.  A 
single importer, Samvel Aleksanian (aka Lfik Samo) controls 
90 percent of sugar imports, nearly all butter imports and a 
large sector of the grain market.  Areg Ghukasian, a 
National Assembly member and brother of Nagorno-Karabakh\'s 
\"president,\" controls all the salt sold in Armenia.  Wheat, 
which is the most important commodity in the consumer price 
basket, is controlled by three major players:  Gagik 
Tsaroukian (aka Dodi Gago, a National Assembly member and 
 
SIPDIS 
Armenia\'s best-known oligarch), Samvel Aleksanian, and 
Mikhail Bagdasarov, a friend of Serzh Sargsian, the powerful 
Minister of Defense.  Close friends of Sargsian, including 
Bagdasarov, control nearly all the competing interests in 
the gasoline market. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
COMPETITION COMMISSION STILL LEARNING TO WALK 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The Commission was created in January 2001 to 
address the undeniable de facto monopolies of the oligarchs, 
but clearly lacks the clout or political support to take on 
the major \"crony capitalists.\"  Pavel Ghaltakhchyan, Deputy 
Chair of the Commission is quick to point out that his is a 
young agency (the age of its members notwithstanding). 
Charged to enforce Armenia\'s competition law, the Commission 
members lack authority to request information from other 
government agencies and to inspect business records. 
Commission members also point to their lack of practical 
experience in competition policy and enforcement.  Even 
though its decisions are subject to judicial review, the 
Commission has no lawyer.  While the activity of the 
Commission has nonetheless increased, it has enforced no 
decision involving wheat, gas, sugar, or poultry, despite 
widely publicized recent prices increases and pressure from 
critics. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PROTECT OLIGOPOLIES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The ultimate capacity of the Commission to deliver 
a competitive market in the goods dominated by oligarch 
traders is severely limited by the Commission\'s weakness vis- 
a-vis other government agencies.  Among the government 
entities instrumental in preserving the oligopolies is the 
Customs Committee.  For dominant importers, it appears that 
Customs lets imports pass under the table:  official imports 
of gasoline have inexplicably declined over the last three 
years despite double digit growth in GDP and increasing 
traffic.  New market entrants can expect much worse 
treatment.  Commissioner Hrayr Aramyan told us that if a new 
company sought to import sugar, for example, \"Customs might 
not let it in, or might hold it in storage for a long time.\" 
(Note:   The Embassy knows of two cases where Customs 
wrongly held a market entrant\'s shipment of wheat until it 
rotted.  End Note.)  Aramyan pointed out that in such a case 
the shipper would complain to Customs, rather than to the 
Commission, as the dominant importer cannot be liable for an 
illegal act of Customs except in the unlikely event the 
Commission could prove that there was an arrangement between 
the two. 
 
---------------------------------- 
COMMENT: CORRUPTION MUST END FIRST 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The creation of the Commission was only a first 
step in solving Armenia\'s competition problems.  In most 
cases the oligopolies\' competitive advantage lies in a cozy 
relationship with some other government agency, and the 
government overall lacks the political will to challenge the 
oligarchs\' control over markets.  The uncompetitive 
environment in Armenia\'s basic goods is as much a question 
of corruption in government -- especially Customs -- as it 
is of abuse of dominant position or anti-competitive 
agreements between private companies.  We believe that 
reform of the Customs administration and a change in 
Armenian cultural tolerance to a certain level of 
corruption, rather than a European-style competition law, 
that will eventually reduce barriers to entry in Armenia\'s 
markets.

1. (SBU) Summary.  The GOAM took the high road in 
response to a physical attack on an investigative 
journalist on August 24 (reftel).  The alleged attacker 
was arrested while Armenia\'s Prosecutor General pressed 
charges.  A senior advisor to President Kocharian 
joined journalists in a \"protest\" on August 28 to show 
support for their independence.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
THE ATTACK 
---------- 
 
2. (SBU) On August 24, investigative journalist Mkhitar 
Kchachatrian was roughed up after he photographed a 
luxury villa as part of a story on construction in 
\"protected\" zones, and Kchachtrian surrendered the 
photo card from his digital camera.  After the attack, 
Kchackatrian stated that he would not go to the police 
because he believed authorities would not pursue the 
case. 
 
------------------------- 
ALLEGED ATTACKER DETAINED 
------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenian authorities briefly detained Gagik 
Stepanian on August 25 in connection with the August 24 
attack on investigative journalist Mkhitar 
Kchachatrian.  An official at the Prosecutor General\'s 
office confirmed to us that Stepanian turned himself in 
to authorities, who later released him pending trial on 
charges of \"hooliganism\" and interfering with the 
performance of someone\'s professional duties. 
According to press reports, Stepanian is employed as a 
bodyguard for Levon Sargsyan, a wealthy member of the 
National Assembly; we cannot confirm these reports. 
 
---------------------------------- 
HIGH-LEVEL SUPPORT FOR JOURNALISTS 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Journalists rallied to support their 
colleague.  In a surprising display of support for 
journalist freedom, Armenian presidential advisor 
Bagrat Yesayan accompanied approximately ten 
journalists August 28 during their tour of the city 
where the alleged attack took place.  During their 
tour, widely billed as a \"protest\" for freedom of the 
press, the journalists took pictures of several luxury 
estates in the area.  There were no confrontations with 
security or incidences of violence during the 
\"protest.\"

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Six containers of clothing shipped from Armenia are 
being held by U.S. Customs (ref A).  The containers hold 
clothing purportedly produced by two of Armenia\'s largest 
textile plants.  U.S. Customs suspects that the garments may 
have been produced outside of Armenia and that their origin 
has been falsified to avoid quota limits.  The American 
importer refuses to ship any more products from these 
plants, DavGar and Hed Hayas, or give any more orders to the 
plant until the dispute is resolved.  Factory owners and 
workers are getting nervous about their jobs and have called 
on the Government of Armenia to intervene; on August 24, 
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ruben Shugarian appealed 
to the Embassy to intervene for the release of the 
containers.  Deputy Minister of Trade Tigran Davtyan told us 
that he intends to raise this issue with USTR 
representatives during the upcoming Trade and Investment 
Panel in Washington.  During Emboff\'s visit to the 
factories, managers told us they were considering bussing 
employees to Yerevan to protest at the Embassy.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
THESE ARE REAL FACTORIES 
------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) While we cannot confirm with complete certainty 
that the goods held by U.S. Customs were produced in 
Armenia, it is clear that these factories do make clothing 
from imported rolls of fabric and do export the lion\'s share 
of that product to a single American client, Prestige 
Apparel.  We visited both factories and have seen the entire 
production process -- from rolled fabric to finished product 
-- involving hundreds of workers, machines, and thousand of 
items of clothing.  Our contact with the factories predates 
this matter:  USAID administers a technical assistance 
project, through Development Alternative International 
(DAI), that assists one of the plants in marketing and 
business development and, among other things, helps them 
meet international standards of records so as to avoid 
export problems. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
STOCK IS BUILDING UP, FACTORIES MAY CUT WORKERS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (SBU) On a recent visit we saw a storeroom where two 
containers of product were being stored because the American 
importer refuses to export the product until his other 
shipments clear.  The manager of Hed Hayas told us that they 
only had fabric to run the factory for another two weeks 
before he would cut forty percent of his staff.  Dav Gar did 
not talk to us about cutting staff but noted that currently 
100 percent of his production was for Prestige Apparel. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
ARMENIAN COUNTRY OF ORIGIN CERTIFICATES NOT HONORED 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. (SBU) Deputy Minister of Trade Tigran Davtyan points out 
that the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Republic of 
Armenia has the government-sponsored monopoly on issuing 
country of origin certificates for goods made in Armenia. 
He told us that he is disturbed that these were not honored 
although no one has made any effort to verify the validity 
of the certificate with the Chamber of Commerce or the 
procedures for its issuance with the Ministry of Trade. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
FIX THIS OR TELL THEM WHY WE HAVE A REAL CASE 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) While the Ministry of Trade has admitted to us that 
they cannot personally vouch for the shipments that are 
actually being held, it is clear that they believe that the 
clothes did originate from these two well-known factories in 
Armenia.  Dav Gar and Hed Hayas have operated since Soviet 
times and together employ more than 2,000 workers, which in 
Armenia is enough to make them well known.  The ministry 
told us that the last time U.S. Customs held a shipment on 
suspicion of transshipment in March and April of 2004, it 
was another well-known Armenian firm, and U.S. Customs 
ultimately released the shipment and did not pursue the 
case.  The Ministry is concerned that holding the shipment 
another week will endanger the onward sales contracts and 
will discourage American importers from using Armenian 
textile factories.  We have agreed with the Ministry of 
Trade that we will work together to implement a system 
where, in the future, U.S. Customs can check the validity of 
Certificates of Origin issued in Armenia and can trust that 
the certificates were issued pursuant to appropriate rules 
of origin subject to sufficient oversight and control (ref. 
B). 
 
7. (SBU) On August 12, U.S. Customs sent a letter to the 
importer requesting more \"production records\" from Hed 
Hayas, and attached the U.S. code specifying which records 
U.S. law requires for import (ref. C).  Factory managers and 
the Deputy Ministry of Trade have commented to us that they 
have already sent sufficient production records to U.S. 
Customs, and the broad request for \"production records 
sufficient to establish the country of origin\" is vague and 
subjective. 
 
-------------- 
ACTION REQUEST 
-------------- 
 
8. (U) This detention has already become a bilateral issue 
and has the potential to become a more serious irritant. 
Post requests that appropriate agencies review this case to 
determine whether the continued detention is appropriate. 
Following that review, we request instruction on substance 
for a credible response to the GOAM.  This response should 
explain why the U.S. believes these factories do not produce 
the product, mix the product with transshipped clothes, or 
are being used as a front for other transshipped clothes. 
Please also advise on how to proceed in order to create a 
channel of communication whereby Certificates of Origin 
issued in Armenian can be verified and trusted by the U.S. 
Customs Service.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Territorial Election Commission (TEC) 
officials declared the results from an August 29 
parliamentary by-election invalid August 31 following 
widespread reports of violations and an unreliably thin 
margin of only 32 votes between the two candidates. 
Analysts viewed the election as an important mid-term 
gauge of local political power for two rival, pro- 
government camps (National Assembly Speaker Arthur 
Baghdasaryan and Procurator General Aghvan Hovsepyan 
each strongly endorsed a candidate in the race). 
Election observers cited numerous cases of ballot 
stuffing and irregularities in the final vote counts. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
REPORTS OF BALLOT STUFFING, BRIBERY IN PRECINT 44 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (U) TEC officials in a precinct just north of 
Yerevan announced August 31 that they had invalidated 
the results of a parliamentary by-election held the 
previous weekend.  With an unusually high voter turnout 
of 67 percent (approximately 28,000 voters), local 
businessmen Artak Sargsyan led challenger Araik 
Hairapetyan by only 32 votes.  The TEC said that the 
election would have to be re-run because the commission 
registered too many discrepancies, including 21 
complaints from the two candidates\' representatives.  A 
small team of Yerevan-based international observers 
(including representatives from \"It\'s Your Choice\") 
reported witnessing violations including an incident in 
which 200 ballots marked for Sargsyan were prevented 
from being stuffed into the ballot box at one of the 
polling stations.  Media coverage included eyewitness 
accounts of payment for votes and local law enforcement 
and procurators unduly meddling into the final count 
process in favor of Hairapetyan.  According to press 
reports, Baghdasaryan and Hovsepyan will separately 
meet with Kocharian to discuss the by-election outcome. 
The TEC has not yet set a date for the re-run. 
 
------------------- 
ZERO-SUM POWER GAME 
------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Both candidates are pro-establishment wealthy 
businessmen representing powerful pro-Kocharian forces. 
Artak Sargsyan represents Baghdasaryan\'s Orinats Yerkir 
(OY) party, while Araik Hairapetyan is backed by 
procurator general Hovsepyan.  Most analysts viewed the 
race as a gauge of Baghdasaryan\'s and Hovsepyan\'s 
relative political clout.  The two other ruling 
coalition parties, the Republican Party and ARF 
Dashnaktsutyun, refrained from endorsing or campaigning 
for the OY candidate, indicating what some observers 
predict may be a cooling-off within the coalition. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4. (SBU) Rumors of Baghdasaryan and Hovsepyan\'s 
ambitions for the next presidential election framed 
this local race as the first tangible political trial 
balloon for potential Kocharian successors.  What the 
failed vote appears to more clearly indicate, however, 
is that serious electoral problems remain in Armenia. 
The only silver lining that we might find here is that 
this is the first election result in recent memory to 
be so quickly annulled for improper democratic 
procedure.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (C) On September 4, 2004, Ambassador Evans presented his 
letters of credence to President Robert Kocharian.  The 
Ambassador conveyed warm best wishes from President Bush, and 
explained how U.S. goals for the South Caucasus -- enhancing 
security and stability, strengthening democratic institutions 
and fostering broad-based, market-oriented economic growth -- 
supported Armenia\'s own aspirations.  He thanked Armenia for 
its contributions to the war on terror and said that recent 
events in Russia made it doubly clear that all civilized 
nations should be fighting this war together.  Kocharian used 
the opportunity to thank the U.S. for its steadfast support 
for Armenia over the years and pledged to continue the close 
working relationship between his Government and the Embassy. 
He urged the U.S. --  the only country which had both the 
trust of all three governments and the power and influence to 
achieve results -- to continue to use its power and influence 
to find solutions to regional issues in the South Caucasus. 
End Summary. 
 
Presentation of Credentials 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) In an elegant, but relatively simple ceremony in the 
rotunda of Armenia\'s Presidential Palace, Ambassador Evans 
presented his credentials to President Robert Kocharian on 
September 4.  The event was well-covered by the Armenian 
press, and the Ambassador\'s formal remarks (forwarded in 
advance to EUR/CACEN) were positively received.  The 
President\'s office issued a press statement after the event 
that expressed appreciation for USG economic assistance, and 
particularly for support in developing Armenia\'s democratic 
institutions.  President Kocharian met with the Ambassador 
for nearly an hour after the presentation, accompanied by FM 
Oskanian and other senior advisers.  President Kocharian 
asked that the Ambassador relay his warm greetings to 
President Bush. 
 
Terrorism: We Are At War 
------------------------ 
 
3. (C) The terrorist attack in North Ossetia dominated the 
early part of the discussion.  \"Our two countries are at 
war,\" the Ambassador said, and Beslan reminded us of how 
urgent our work is.  Kocharian pledged his continued support 
to global efforts against terrorism and noted how important 
Armenia\'s cooperation with the U.S. on intelligence sharing 
was to this effort.  We face a common enemy, Kocharian 
underscored, and we must make a cooperative effort to defeat 
them. 
 
Armenia Grateful for U.S. Assistance 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) Kocharian thanked the USG for its steadfast support 
for Armenia\'s transition over the years, and particularly for 
its generous and essential assistance programs.  He said his 
government was working hard on its proposals for the 
Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and asked whether any new 
information would be available soon.  The Ambassador said the 
U.S. Government was fortunate to have significant resources 
available for its programs of assistance, but that we could 
not expect such resources to be available indefinitely.  Both 
sides should take full advantage of this window of 
opportunity to produce results. The Ambassador said he had 
met with top MCA officials in Washington just before 
departing for Yerevan; new information for Armenia should be 
available soon, perhaps in time for meetings on the margins 
of the upcoming U.S. - Armenia Task Force in early October. 
 
We Appreciate Your Embassy\'s Dynamism 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Kocharian praised the work of Ambassador Ordway and 
said the two had enjoyed an active relationship.  He asked 
the Ambassador to continue the Embassy\'s dynamic approach to 
its work and to continue the practice of spending so much 
time and energy outside of Yerevan.  Kocharian was pleased 
the Ambassador had already reached out to the 
Armenian-American community; ties to the Diaspora are 
particularly important for Armenia.  The Ambassador said he 
planned to build on the strong record of Ambassador Ordway 
and his predecessors, and noted that he would continue the 
practice of regular outreach to the Armenian-American 
community. 
 
Resolving Conflicts in the South Caucasus 
----------------------------------------- 
6. (C) Kocharian thanked the Ambassador for the USG\'s drive 
to resolve regional conflicts and to enhance security in the 
South Caucasus.  He urged the U.S. to take on a still greater 
role on these issues as \"the only country which had both the 
trust of all three governments and the power and influence to 
achieve results on security issues.\"  He asked the Embassy to 
continue to be in close touch with the Foreign Ministry on 
issues related to Nagorno-Karabakh.  The Ambassador said that 
the U.S. remained committed to supporting the countries of 
the South Caucasus as they resolve their conflicts and build 
stronger relationships, but stressed that the countries 
themselves must do all in their power to devise solutions. 
\"We want Armenia and its neighbors to succeed.\"  The 
Ambassador said the Embassy would continue to support the 
work of the Minsk Group, but made it clear that Ambassador 
Mann, and not he, would be in the lead on all issues related 
to N-K. 
 
Resolving Conflicts Will Grow Armenia\'s Economy 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (C) President Kocharian spoke at length about the 
importance of USG assistance in reforming Armenia\'s economy. 
We are beginning to see real results, Kocharian said, and the 
share of GDP produced by small and medium-sized enterprises 
continues to grow.  He agreed with the Ambassador that the 
fastest way to grow Armenia\'s economy would be to resolve the 
conflicts which limit trade with Armenia\'s neighbors.  The 
high cost of transport brought about by closed borders has 
clearly affected Armenia\'s development, Kocharian lamented, 
while noting that a certain amount of enforced import 
substitution had not been a bad thing for Armenia\'s 
producers.  He said the challenge for Armenia was now to help 
its small and medium-sized producers develop new export 
markets.  The Ambassador outlined how U.S. assistance 
programs were helping producers learn to market their 
products abroad.  Kocharian expressed appreciation for this 
assistance and for any help the USG could provide to 
encourage Turkey to open its border with Armenia. 
 
Defense Cooperation 
------------------- 
 
8. (C) President Kocharian noted the growing defense 
relationship.  He said that Armenia\'s transportation unit was 
nearly ready for deployment to Iraq; this unit\'s integration 
into the Polish-led force there would be a topic of his 
September 5-7 trip to  Poland.  He said his government was 
committed to completing a EUCOM-led Defense Assessment, but 
remained highly sensitive to any intrusion into defense 
issues related to Nagorno-Karabakh.  Kocharian pledged 
increased focus on issues related to NATO and PFP.  The 
Ambassador welcomed Armenia\'s assent to conducting a defense 
assessment and said that the USG understood Armenia\'s 
sensitivities.  He made it clear that the USG saw no inherent 
contradiction between U.S. and Russian interests in Armenia. 
Asked if he had any questions, the Ambassador said \"no,\" and 
the conversation ended on a positive note.

ARMENIAN-POLISH SECURITY COOPERATION AGREEMENT 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
1. (SBU) On September 6, Armenian President Robert 
Kocharian signed a security cooperation agreement with 
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski which will lay 
the groundwork for the deployment to Iraq of 50 
Armenian non-combat troops with Polish forces.  George 
Kocharian, Head of the Military-Political Cooperation 
Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirmed 
that the GOAM intends to deploy mostly transport 
personnel, trucks, a few de-miners, and three doctors. 
He noted that the GOAM wanted to act in unity with 
Europe and shoulder an adequate amount of the burden so 
that Armenia would truly be part of the European 
\"club.\"  A newspaper associated with the defense 
ministry reasoned that deployment to Iraq would 
significantly improve U.S./Armenian relations and 
offset the \"advantage\" Azerbaijan currently enjoys in a 
more favorable relationship with the U.S. 
 
----------------------------- 
OPPOSITION JUMPS ON THE ISSUE 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Several Armenian opposition newspapers raised 
concerns that deployment to Iraq could harm Armenia\'s 
relationship with Russia, and the (frequently less-than- 
reliable) opposition newspaper Haykakan Zhamanak used 
the opportunity to take aim at Minister of Defense, 
Serzh Sargsian.  In an uncharacteristically pro-Russian 
stance, the paper repeated Russian newspaper 
accusations that Sargsian had \"betrayed\" Russia, and 
the quoted a disaffected general who disagreed with 
deployment, supposedly speaks with the authority of the 
Russian military general staff, but who has more 
authority than his \"illegitimate supreme commander.\" 
The opposition, which has often hailed the Council of 
Europe and Western-supported NGOs during human rights\' 
disputes, now seems ready to exploit pro-Russian biases 
in order to embarrass the Kocharian government.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) During Iranian President Mohammad Khatami\'s visit to 
Yerevan September 8-9, the Armenian and Iranian governments 
signed a deal to finance the Armenia-Iran gas pipeline as far 
as Kajaran, 41 kilometers into Armenia.  In May the 
governments had signed an agreement providing for the 
construction of the pipeline and a swap of natural gas from 
Iran for electricity produced in Armenia (ref A).  But it was 
never clear how Armenia was going to pay for its portion of 
the pipeline;  the government had been unsuccessfully seeking 
private investment.  While the economics of the project still 
don\'t pencil out, both governments view the pipeline as an 
important part of their energy strategy:  Iran as a step 
towards exporting to new markets and Armenia as a necessary 
measure to ensure its energy security and diversity of 
supply.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
IRANIAN EXPORT BANK TO FINANCE PIPELINE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Since Armenia and Iran signed a 20-year gas for 
electricity swap deal in May 2004, it has been unclear how 
Armenia intended to finance its portion of the pipeline.  The 
Iranian Bank for Export and Development has agreed to finance 
a USD 30 million segment of the pipeline from the border of 
Iran to Kajaran, Armenia, 41 kilometers north.  The Armenian 
Ministry of Energy will pay back the loan over 7 years at 5 
percent annual interest.  In a shift from prior 
announcements, the GOAM has forgone its search for private 
investors for the pipeline and has decided to bear the debt 
burden itself. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
BAD FOR BUSINESS, BUT GOOD ENERGY POLICY 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The pipeline\'s lack of private investors is no 
surprise:  the deal has never made economic sense (ref B). 
Armenian officials have nevertheless made the pipeline the 
number one energy priority.  Facing the closure of the 
Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) as early as 2015, Armenia 
wants to reduce its long-term reliance on the single gas 
pipeline through Georgia that accounts for 80 percent of 
Armenia\'s non-nuclear energy supply (refs C and D).  Memory 
of the energy crisis following the temporary closure of ANPP 
in the early 1990s still stings, and Armenia is unlikely to 
waver in its ambitions to diversify its energy sources.  For 
its part, Iranian officials reportedly told the IMF Resident 
Representative in Yerevan that they viewed the pipeline as 
part of a larger strategy to export gas to new markets in 
hope of someday reaching Europe. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  AMERICAN POLICY LEAVES NO OPTIONS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The GOAM is aware of U. S. opposition to gas pipelines 
from Iran, and say that they have looked carefully at ILSA 
(ref A).  But they are caught in a three-way Catch 22: 
 
--We oppose any pipeline through Iran, whether it carries 
Iranian or Turkmen gas; 
 
--We oppose the continued operation (not to mention the 
probable extended operation -- ref D) of ANPP; and 
 
--We oppose Armenia\'s complete energy dependence on Russia 
and Russian investment to upgrade and expand the gas pipeline 
through Georgia. 
 
While the GOAM is aware of our policy rationales for each 
objection, taken together their effect is to remove us from 
the debate on all these topics as we fail to offer any 
sustainable solution to Armenia\'s energy concerns.

COMMISISONER BONNER 
 
 
1.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs transmitted the 
following letter to the Embassy September 13, 2004.  The 
original English language text follows. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
03/09/2004 
 
Mr. Robert C. Bonner 
Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
Department of Homeland Security 
Government of the United States of America 
1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW 
Washington, DC 
20229 
 
Dear Commissioner Bonner: 
 
I am writing to you to express my concerns with 
respect to US Customs treatment of exports to the 
United States of clothing articles manufactured by an 
Armenian textile manufacturer, Hayas Group OJSC, a 
respected Armenian company which for more than ten 
years has manufactured clothing articles in Armenia 
for export to many countries around the world. 
Indeed, I am surprised at what appears to be 
prejudicial treatment by US Customs officials of an 
Armenian exporter given the long-standing close 
relations between the Governments of the Republic of 
Armenia and the United States of America. 
 
At this time, US Customs officials in New York and 
Los Angeles are detaining a number of shipments 
exported by Hayas Group to Hilltop Industries Inc. of 
Irwindale, California.  The US Customs officials 
requested information to confirm that the clothing 
articles exported from Armenia by Hayas Group were 
manufactured in Armenia, and not simply transshipped 
through Armenia from other countries.  Hayas Group 
has provided extensive information to Hilltop 
Industries to confirm the manufacturing operations it 
has conducted in Armenia in the production of these 
clothing articles, which Hilltop Industries has in 
turn furnished to the US Customs officials.  The US 
Customs officials, however, are apparently not 
satisfied and have made oral requests for additional 
information but, apparently, they have refused to 
give any written confirmation of the specific 
information they require. 
 
I consider this situation to be most distressing, 
especially given the significant resources the 
Government of the United States has invested in the 
development of a viable market economy in Armenia.  I 
request therefore that you review this matter with 
your officials to ensure that Hayas Group is not 
unfairly prevented from exporting to the United 
States the clothing articles it manufactures in 
Armenia. 
 
I will be pleased to provide to you any additional 
information you may require.  Thank you very much 
for your attention to this matter. 
 
Yours truly, 
 
/s/ 
 
Karen Chshmaritian 
Minister of Trade and Economic Development Republic of 
Armenia

SUBJECT: OFFICIAL VISIT OF PRESIDENT KHATAMI TO ARMENIA 
 
REF: YEREVAN 02019 
 
Classified By: DCM A.F. GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) During Iranian President\'s Mohammad Khatami\'s visit to 
Yerevan, September 8-9, the Armenian and Iranian governments 
signed seven agreements including the agreements concerning 
the partial financing and construction of an Armenian-Iranian 
gas pipeline.  The local press and the Armenian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) officials portrayed the visit as 
symbolically and economically important.  Press reports 
claimed that the visit signaled increased political and 
economic relations between Iran and Armenia. 
 
---------------------- 
GAS PIPELINE AGREEMENT 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) On September 8-9 Iranian President Mohammed Khatami 
paid an official state visit to Armenia.  We met with MFA 
officials including Chief of the Middle Affairs division 
Karen Mirzoyan and Iran Desk Officer Garnik Badalian after 
the official visit to get a briefing on the substance of the 
visit.  They confirmed the details of the USD 30 million loan 
to the Armenian Energy Ministry (reftel).  Per the agreement, 
the Iranian construction company \"Sanir\" was named as the 
primary contractor.  Mirzoyan and Badalian agreed that the 
Armenian government still needed approximately USD 70 million 
to complete the pipeline and neither had a clear idea of the 
origin for the funding. However, both believed that once 
pipeline construction was started, it would be easier to find 
either GOAM or international funding to finish the project. 
Badalian believed that due to weather and bureaucratic 
realities, the actual construction of the pipeline would 
start in the spring of 2005.  Both Mirzoyan and Badalian were 
confident that gas would start to be imported from Iran by 
the agreed upon 2007 date. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
ARMENIAN-IRANIAN GOVERNMENT AGREEMENTS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Mirzoyan and Badalian confirmed that the Armenian 
government and Iranian government signed the following 
agreements: 
     -- Agreement on Principles and Bases for Cooperation 
between the Republic of Armenia (GOA) and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran (GOI). 
     -- Memorandum of Understanding on the 5th Joint Session 
of Inter-Governmental Commission on Armenian Iranian ties. 
     -- Cultural Cooperation Programs for 2005-2007 between 
the GOA and the GOI 
     -- Memorandum of Understanding between the Customs State 
Committee of Armenia and the Iranian Customs Service on 
implementation of the Agreement on Administrative Assistance 
in Customs Affairs. 
     -- Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Cooperation 
between the Armenian and Iranian Ministries of Energy 
     -- Agreement on Financing the gas pipeline for 
Meghri-Kajaran section 
     -- Contract on Construction of the gas pipeline. 
 
 
4.  (C)  Mirzoyan and Badalian strongly felt that the MOU 
between the ministries of energy and the pipeline agreements 
were the most critical of Khatami\'s visit. Mirzoyan 
characterized most of the remaining agreements as more 
protocolary in nature and said that this visit was primarily 
about economic issues. Badalian stated that both sides had 
wanted to sign an agreement concerning the Kajaran tunnel, 
but due to time constraints and last minute unresolved 
details it was not possible.  Badalian believed that the 
details could be easily worked out and the agreement could be 
signed at the ministerial level in the near future.  Mirzoyan 
wryly observed that as slow as the Armenian MFA works, the 
Iranian MFA is twice as slow. 
 
------------------------------ 
MFA VIEW OF A SUCCESSFUL VISIT 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  Mirzoyan and Badalian both felt that the visit was a 
success because it was the first visit of an Iranian 
president since the independence of Armenia.  They believed 
it also showed that Iran was able to balance it\'s political 
and economic interests between Azerbaijan, Armenia, and 
Turkey.  The GOA was also pleased that Khatami agreed to 
visit the genocide memorial.  Mirzoyan and Badalian were 
however concerned about what reaction the United States 
Government (USG) would have to Khatami\'s visit and were 
searching for any public or official reaction from the 
American press and the Department of State. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  While there is clear evidence that both the GOA and 
the GOI have taken concrete steps to try and increase the 
level of cooperation between both countries, serious doubts 
remain as to whether these joint projects will materialize 
and if they have any lasting effect on the economic and 
political relations between Armenia and Iran.

REF: STATE 80982 
 
Classified By: DCM A.F. Godfrey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (S/NF) Armenia does not have an active biological warfare 
program nor does it have an interest, desire or capability to 
start one (reftel).  The Armenian government has denied ever 
having a biological warfare program and currently Armenian 
biological institutes and private companies are struggling 
with low salaries and lack of new equipment.  This 
significantly hampers their ability to find international and 
domestic clients to purchase their vaccines, medicines and 
technological know-how.  The Armenian government has 
instituted strict export laws concerning the export, import 
and transit of dual-use items.  The Armenian emergency 
management administration stated that protection against 
biological attack was a lower government priority than 
preparing for other potential disasters, such as earthquakes, 
chemical or nuclear accidents.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
ACQUISITION OF BW-RELATED ITEMS AND EXPERTISE WMDB 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (S/NF) The MFA\'s Armen Isralian and Aram Tanyan, Deputy 
Head of the Armenian Emergency Management Administration 
(AEMA), both stated in no uncertain terms that the Armenian 
government (GOAM) did not conduct any biological warfare 
research during the Soviet period, that no research is 
currently underway and that they strongly believed that there 
was no interest or capability to start a program now.  Both 
explained that it was against Soviet doctrine to have any 
sensitive defense research located in a Soviet republic which 
bordered a NATO country.  Both also explained that soon after 
independence, with the terrible economic conditions and lack 
of electricity, it would have been nearly impossible to start 
and/or maintain any type of biological weapons program in 
Armenia.  Jean Akopian of the Institute of Microbiology (IM) 
told us that none of Armenia\'s chemical or biological 
institutes were secret closed institutes during the Soviet 
period, which was a prerequisite to conduct sensitive defense 
research.  Post has no evidence that the GOAM is working with 
any other country in order to acquire WMDB. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
BW-ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT AND ARMENIAN EXPORT CONTROL POLICIES 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
3. (S/NF) Israelian told us that in 2003 the GOAM had 
established an export law modeled on the Australian group 
principles.  This law gives the Armenian export commission 
multiple tools to turn down any export that has dual-use 
properties.  The commission consists of nine deputy ministers 
who have the ability to call in scientific experts if needed. 
 The export control law carries penalties of up to eight 
years in prison and the commission has the legal right to 
question scientists that were working on biological programs 
overseas.  Isrealian told us that to his knowledge, the GOAM 
has never exported any biological agents.  Isrealian stated 
that a GOAM concern was that Armenia could become a transit 
corridor for illegal dual use items for Iran, and therefore, 
the GOAM purposefully made their export laws as strict as 
possible.  Israelian told us that after the fall of the 
Soviet Union, hundreds, if not thousands of qualified 
Armenian scientists and specialists either emigrated to 
Europe, America and Russia or simply took up other 
professions.  Israelian, as well as others in the scientific 
community, also stated that he had no first hand knowledge of 
any Armenian scientists who have worked or were currently 
working on Iranian or other rogue nation biological or other 
weapons programs.  Scientists have told us that oppressive 
Islamic environments, low pay, perceived low level of science 
and concerns about working with pariah states have 
discouraged most if not all Armenian scientists from working 
in Iran or other rogue nations.  The scientists and directors 
of scientific institutes told us that that western grants 
have helped Armenian scientists stay in Armenia, but more 
consistent funding from the GOAM will be needed in order to 
stop good Armenian scientists from emigrating or leaving the 
field of science altogether. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
BW DETECTION, DECONTAMINATION AND MEDICAL CARE 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4. (S/NF) After discussions with senior officials at the MOD, 
the defense attache reported his impression that the MOD has 
limited chemical, and biological defense capabilities and are 
placing biological defense at a low priority due to the lack 
of resources and low perceived threat.  The MOD does have one 
specialized unit, the 21st independent nuclear biological 
chemical defense battalion, which has approximately 92 
soldiers.  In order to deploy soldiers to Iraq as part of the 
coalition, the MOD had formally requested vaccinations 
against anthrax, typhoid, meningitis and smallpox. 
5. (S/NF) AEMA\'s Tanayan told us that his organization was 
working with international donors on various disaster relief 
projects to prepare for possible earthquakes and/or chemical 
accidents.  Tanyan told us that the AEMA does have a nuclear, 
biological, chemical laboratory where they can test for 
various chemical, radioactive and biological agents.  He also 
reported that the equipment is from the Soviet era, not up to 
international standards and does not allow the AEMA to 
conduct tests quickly.  Tanyan stated that AEMA has good 
specialists in biological, chemical and nuclear disciplines 
but they do not have the training, language skills and 
equipment to do international level work.  AEMA has a plan to 
open an local AEMA office in every region of Armenia in order 
to coordinate with all GOA agencies in the event of a 
disaster.  Tananyan admitted it would be very difficult to 
outfit all of the offices with modern equipment in order to 
do any accurate testing.  He stated that AEMA was working 
with local scientific institutes and various government 
agencies to compile a complete list of biological entities 
and where and how they were stored in Armenia. 
 
6. (S/NF) Tanyan explained that the AEMA SOP for any 
outbreaks of biological hazards among crops was to isolate 
and quarantine the infected area and then burn the crops. 
AEMA has the same SOP for infected farm animals.  Tananyan 
told us that Armenia has had some outbreaks of dysentery and 
cholera in the regions outside Yerevan but they were able to 
contain them quickly.  AEMA stated that they currently do not 
have any biological detection devices and they believed that 
the GOAM and the MOD were also probably lacking such 
equipment.  AEMA complained that they have very few vaccines 
on hand and do not even have the minimum stockpiles for 
ordinary problems such as snakebites and insects. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
IMPACT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY OF RESEARCH PATHOGENS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
7. (S/NF) Dr. Harachya Hovhannisyan, a senior biologist at 
Armenicum, told us that the lack of modern equipment 
seriously limited the international-level work was being 
conducted in the field of biotechnology in Armenia. 
Armenicum, an Armenian biotechnology company currently being 
funded by Armenian businessmen (allegedly including Minister 
of Defense Serzh Sargsian) was one of the exceptions. 
Hovhannisyan told us that Armenicum was working on AIDS 
vaccines and had sold some medications to Indian clients. 
Dr. Hovhannisyan stated that Armenicum was guarded by 
Armenian soldiers, and he felt that this measure had been 
taken to safeguard the expensive American machinery as well 
as Sargsian\'s personal investment.  Dr. Akopian of IM 
explained that IM was currently specializing in sugar 
substitutes, nitrogen, natural zeolites, and agricultural 
nitrogen techniques.  Akopian told us that they have garnered 
some interest from the Chinese company Northstar.  The 
Armenian Lysine Plant, Lizin, who had been sanctioned by the 
Department of State in May of 2002 for two years for the 
attempted sale of fermenters to Iran, told us that after 
their sanction expired, they planned to market and sell 
livestock feed, lysine, vitamins, medicines and sugar 
substitutes to local domestic companies as well as any 
interested international clients.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The IMF team conducting the Sixth review of 
Armenia\'s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) 
program has left Armenia concerned about Armenia\'s progress 
in key areas of reform.  The Resident Representative, James 
McHugh, told us that he anticipated problems completing the 
sixth review and disbursing the program\'s final tranche to 
the GOAM.  While the government has successfully completed 
many of the easy reforms, it has been loath to or incapable 
of addressing those reforms that touch most heavily on 
corruption in the economy -- namely, reform of the tax and 
customs services.  According to McHugh, Armenia has reached a 
critical juncture:  it must decide if it has the political 
will to reform in the way that will fundamentally change the 
nature of its crony capitalist economy.  \"Put bluntly,\" said 
McHugh, \"We have to see if they are willing to tax rich 
people.\"  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
UNMET CONDITIONS 
---------------- 
 
2. (SBU) During the donor out-brief the visiting IMF review 
team described their concerns about Armenia\'s unmet 
obligations in guarded language.  While the GOAM has 
expressly asked for a waiver of one energy sector measure 
(ref A), it seeks to address what the GOAM itself has called 
\"severe deficiencies\" in meeting its fiscal measures with \"a 
two-year action plan to deal with pending tax and customs 
reforms.\"  The action plan would establish a timeline that 
presumably would be part of a conditionality under any 
follow-on program.   The proposed reforms would purportedly 
aim to reorganize the structures of the tax and customs 
services in order to control the enforcement and audit 
functions, which currently harass medium-sized businessmen 
into overpaying in order to make up for lost revenues that 
large businesses do not pay.  The government claims to have 
met technical tax and customs conditionalities (concerning 
VAT administration and customs valuation) that the IMF sees 
as indicative of larger administrative problems and as a 
burden on medium-sized business and foreign investment.  The 
IMF team is skeptical of the government\'s claims and has gone 
back to the government requesting more information:  the team 
doubts reports that the customs service has used transaction 
or invoice prices to value 50 percent of imports; the tax 
service\'s claimed progress in accruing only a negligible 
amount of VAT refund arrears belies the stories of 
medium-sized businesses, who uniformly claim that the 
government\'s arrears to them are increasing. 
 
---------------------------- 
TAXING THE MIDDLE CLASS ONLY 
---------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) In less formal meetings, including two meetings with 
the Ambassador, the IMF representatives spoke more candidly 
about Armenia\'s progress, and talked less about the specific 
conditionalities than the overall status of corruption. 
Although the suspect conditionalities are technical, they all 
reflect the reluctance of the tax and customs services to tax 
big businesses and the concomitant need to extract extra 
revenues from medium-size businesses to compensate.  The 
customs conditionality requires the Customs Service to use 
the actual invoice price to value goods for purposes of 
tariffs and value added tax:  customs currently uses flexible 
valuation methods with the dual goals of increasing revenues 
from medium sized importers and soliciting bribes.  According 
to the IMF, discriminatory valuation by customs keeps 
Armenia\'s oligarchs in control of the lion\'s share of 
Armenia\'s basic food imports because well-connected importers 
are bribing customs officials in exchange for not paying 
taxes on the import of basic goods (ref B).  Similarly, large 
enterprises pay almost no taxes, while medium-sized firms 
complain of harassing audits, demands for prepayment, and the 
inability to get their refunds due from overpayment of value 
added tax.  At the time of the last IMF review, the 
government\'s arrears of non-refunded VAT equaled nearly 1.5 
percent of GDP, owed mostly to small and medium firms.  While 
the government has claimed, per agreement, not to have 
increased the total stock of arrears during 2004, American 
firms have uniformly reported to us that the arrears owed to 
their respective companies was growing. 
 
------------------------------ 
COMMENT:  SQUEEZING A BALLOON? 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) The IMF conditionalities all aim to make corrupt 
behavior more difficult.  Because these are also the areas 
that currently affect the interests of U.S. investors, VAT 
refunds and customs valuation also appear on our bilateral 
agenda in the U.S.-Armenia Task Force on Economic Development 
(USATF).  But the larger battle concerns not these technical 
procedures but whether the government is willing to raise 
significant revenue from the well-connected oligarchs who 
control much of the economy, or whether the tax and customs 
service will continue to extract revenue only from the middle 
classes by semi-legal or harassing means.  In order to 
realize progress in the area of VAT refunds or customs 
valuation without substituting another evil, there must be 
true change in the nature of taxation and its relationship to 
Armenia\'s oligarchs.  Notably, offices in the administration 
of tax and customs must cease to be seats of rent-seeking 
activity.  Unless the government can reorganize the tax and 
customs services in a way that truly brings them under the 
control of officials who are genuinely interested in reform, 
the tax burden will continue to fall disproportionately on 
medium-size businesses and foreign investors, who lack the 
necessary contacts and influence to make favorable 
arrangements with corrupt officials.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) In his first meeting with the Ambassador on September 
20, Armenia\'s Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan stated that 
Armenia highly valued its developing defense relationship 
with the U.S., stood ready to cooperate on an upcoming 
Defense Assessment and was preparing troops for deployment to 
Iraq.  He expressed regret that Armenia was not able to 
participate in a NATO exercise in Azerbaijan and concurred 
with the Ambassador that the exercise cancellation helped 
neither side.  Sargsyan said that while there were few 
concrete signs of progress from the Astana Summit on a 
resolution of N-K, he expected President Kocharian to be 
contacting President Aliyev within the next month or so to 
propose next steps.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) On September 20, the Ambassador paid his initial call 
on Armenia\'s Defense Minister, Serzh Sargsyan.  With Sargsyan 
were General Mikhael Melkonyan, Head of the MOD\'s Department 
of Foreign Relations and Military Cooperation and Colonel 
Hayk Kotanjian, Advisor to the Minister of Defense.  DCM, 
DATT and ODC Chief accompanied the Ambassador.  Press 
coverage of the meeting was both positive and accurate. 
After President Kocharian, Sargsyan is broadly considered to 
be Armenia\'s most influential political figure. 
 
Parliament to Review Iraq Deployment in November 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3.  (C) The Ambassador opened by reviewing U.S. goals in the 
South Caucasus, thanking Armenia for its contribution to the 
war on terrorism and saluting Armenia\'s intention to deploy 
troops to Iraq.  Sargsyan stated that Armenia\'s deployment 
was passing through the last stages of interagency approval, 
after which the Constitutional Court would review the terms 
of the planned deployment.  The final package would then be 
sent to the National Assembly for final approval.  Sargsyan 
estimated that the National Assembly would begin addressing 
the issue in early November.  Sargsyan acknowledged that the 
deployment was a hot-button issue in Armenia, but predicted 
that the National Assembly would approve the deployment.  He 
added that Armenia was obliged to participate in Iraq to the 
extent that it is capable. 
 
Bilateral Military Relations 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Sargsyan expressed appreciation for the developing 
military relationship with the U.S. and expressed hope that 
it would continue to broaden and deepen.  He reiterated 
Armenia\'s readiness to go forward with a Defense Assessment, 
saying that there were \"no obstacles within the framework of 
the agreement,\" referring to limits on the assessment from 
considering issues relating to Nagorno-Karabakh.  Ambassador 
Evans praised this step, adding that the Defense Assessment, 
which the USG is preparing to conduct, was a key tool for 
identifying ways to best use available resources to develop 
capabilities which can be used to support shared goals. 
 
5.  (C) Sargsyan told the Ambassador he remained convinced 
that the best use of FMF continued to be for the purchase of 
communications equipment, a point underscored by his 
government\'s interest in using national funds to supplement 
FMF.  The Ambassador said the Defense Assessment was just the 
right tool for deciding how best to apply resources.  ODC 
Chief suggested that the current pattern of purchases did not 
take into account the incomplete nature of Armenia\'s 
communications infrastructure. 
 
6.  (C) Sargsyan expressed satisfaction at press reports that 
the U.S. would maintain parity between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
on Foreign Military Financing (FMF) funding levels.  The 
Ambassador pointed out that there had never been any thought 
in Washington of upsetting the existing military balance in 
the region.  He noted that military assistance was a tool 
intended to help potential allies develop capabilities and 
reminded Sargsyan that Azerbaijan has been a key U.S. ally in 
the Global War on Terrorism, with boots on the ground in 
various coalition operations.  Sargsyan took the point, and 
said that Armenia \"understands its obligations\" and will keep 
its agreement to deploy. 
 
Ambassador: Nobody Won When CBE-04 Was Canceled 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7.  (C) Ambassador Evans said that the U.S. fully supported 
NATO\'s decision to cancel Cooperative Best Effort 04 and 
regretted Azerbaijan\'s decision to not permit Armenian 
officers to travel to Baku.  He noted that this was not a 
cause for rejoicing, adding that it was hard to see how this 
development would contribute to maintaining stability in the 
months ahead.  Sargsyan concurred and said he would address 
this and other topics during a press conference in the near 
future. 
 
Sargsyan Not So Pessimistic on Astana 
------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) The Ambassador asked how the GOAM saw the results of 
meetings between Presidents Kocharian and Aliyev in Astana; 
we were disappointed at what appeared to be a lack of 
progress.  Sargsyan had been briefed on the substance of the 
meetings, but seemed less pessimistic about their results. 
He said that it had been a good meeting; the first such 
one-on-one meeting for over a year.  He praised the work of 
the Minsk Group and hoped that their efforts would continue. 
He said that we might know more about where things were 
heading \"after a month or a month and a half,\" but gave no 
specifics about what to expect.  The Ambassador thanked 
Sargsyan for the brief and took the opportunity that Amb. 
Mann would continue to have the lead for the USG on issues 
relating to N-K.

Dear Mr. President, we write to you from the spiritual 
center of the Armenian Church, the Mother See of Holy 
Etchmiadzin, and extend our Pontifical blessings and 
solidarity to you and all Americans.  Today when the world 
pauses with the United States to commemorate the third 
anniversary of the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington 
and Pennsylvania, we once again offer condolences on behalf 
of all Armenian people throughout the world, and pray for 
eternal rest for all innocent victims of violence. 
 
The recent tragic events in the Russian Federation once more 
bear witness that humanity today is facing many challenges. 
Violence, terrorism, and acts of senseless aggression must 
be condemned by all peoples and all governments.  Mankind 
will conquer evil when we become united in our quest to 
defeat terror, fear and hate; when we struggle together for 
the dream of all people, peace, prosperity, human rights, 
civil liberties and freedom. 
 
As Catholicos of All Armenians, we pray for the grace of the 
Holy Spirit to enter into the hearts of men, and for peace 
and security to be established throughout the world.  We 
believe that the unending mercy an compassionate love of the 
Almighty is always with us, and will fortify us in this 
task.  May our Lord Jesus Christ bestow wisdom and strength 
to you, your family, the government and people of the United 
States, now and always.  With blessings, Karekin II,

(S) Karen Nazarian, Special Advisor to Armenia\'s Foreign 
Minister, told us September 24 that FM Vartan Oskanian had 
asked him to serve as Armenia\'s next Ambassador to Iran.  He 
said the information was still extremely close-hold and that 
only the President, FM and a handful within the MFA were 
aware of the decision.  Nazarian claimed that the news came 
as a surprise to him, but linked it to his role in 
successfully managing the MFA\'s role in three recently 
announced bi-lateral energy and infrastructure projects -- 
the Armenia-Iran gas pipeline, thermal water station and 
Kajaran Pass tunnel (reftel).  Nazarian appeared confident 
that the nomination would gain approval from President 
Kocharian\'s office, especially in light of Nazarian\'s 
multiple trips to Tehran accompanying the President.  He said 
that Iran issues were becoming increasingly important within 
the MFA as demonstrated by the recent state visit by Iranian 
President Khatami and MFA\'s choice to promote Armenia\'s 
current Ambassador to Iran, Geram Garibdzhanian, to the post 
of Deputy Minister (the MFA has not confirmed the news 
regarding Garibdzhanian, although press reports continue to 
rumor the move).

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C)  The National Assembly Speaker-backed candidate won a 
controversial parliamentary by-election September 19 in a 
Yerevan suburb after the only remaining candidate (backed by 
Armenia\'s Procurator General) withdrew from the race only a 
few days earlier.  Analysts viewed the election, which had to 
be re-run after accusations of mass irregularities, as a 
prelude to Armenia\'s next presidential election, highlighting 
a power struggle between NA Speaker Artur Baghdasaryan and 
Procurator General Aghvan Hovsepian to determine which camp 
had both high-level and popular support.  President Robert 
Kocharian\'s hand was evident in the run-up to the election; 
neither party denied rumors that an early September meeting 
between the President and NA Speaker produced an agreement to 
have the Procurator General\'s candidate withdraw in exchange 
for future cooperation on upcoming legislative items 
important to Kocharian.  Observers from \"It\'s Your Choice\" (a 
USG-supported NGO) noted fewer visible violations during the 
second balloting, but highlighted continued administrative 
glitches and problems with unauthorized police presence in 
most polling places.  For the moment, dividing the proverbial 
power pie appears to remain more important than the 
democratic process.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
BAGHDASARYAN\'S CANDIDATE WINS AFTER PG\'S MAN DROPS OUT 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2. (C) Artak Sargsian (backed by National Assembly Speaker 
and Orinats Yerkir party chairman Artur Baghdasaryan) 
defeated Araik Hairapetian (backed by Procurator General 
Aghvan Hovsepian) in the September 19 parliamentary 
by-election re-run in a Yerevan suburb.  The win increased 
the current number of Orinats-Yerkir (Country of Law) members 
of parliament from 21 to 22.  The election was re-run after 
the Central Election Commission declared the initial 
elections void due to an extremely small winning margin and 
following accusations of mass irregularities during the 
original August 29 balloting (reftel).  In a surprise move, 
Hairapetian \"unofficially\" withdrew from the race on 
September 16.  His name, however, still appeared on the 
ballot and he managed to grab 37 percent of the votes cast. 
Both candidates, well-connected businessmen with ties to 
light industry in central Armenia, were relatively unknown in 
political arenas leading up to the election.  Their 
high-profile backers, both of whom have made veiled 
statements about their presidential aspirations in 2007, 
dominated news reports and speculation leading up to the 
election.  Most viewed the election as the first real 
indication of their relative power, both at the ballot box 
and among the current political elite. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
KOCHARIAN-BAGHDASARYAN MEETING SETTLES THE MATTER? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
3. (C) President Robert Kocharian\'s hand was evident in the 
run-up to the election.  Neither party, nor the President\'s 
office, denied rumors that an early September meeting between 
the President and NA Speaker produced an agreement to have 
the Procurator General\'s candidate withdraw in exchange for 
future cooperation on upcoming legislative items important to 
Kocharian.  In fact, Kocharian\'s office confirmed that the 
meeting had taken place and that the issue was among the 
topics they discussed. 
 
4. (C) Mikael Danielyan, Chairman of Armenia\'s Helsinki 
Commission, told DCM on September 22 that the election was 
\"typical of our level of democratic development.\"  He added 
that the word on the street is that Kocharian agreed that the 
Procurator General\'s candidate would receive an appointment 
as a Deputy Minister by year\'s end in exchange for his 
withdrawal from the race.  Embassy sources close to Kocharian 
reported that the electoral stand-off put Kocharian in an 
awkward position that threatened to disrupt the delicate 
balance that he maintains within the GOAM.  By finding a 
mutually acceptable outcome for both the Speaker and 
Procurator General\'s office, Kocharian reportedly avoided a 
dissolution of power before the other legislative coalition 
forces -- the Republican Party and ARF Dashnaksutyun Parties 
-- were politically forced to take sides on the matter. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
BALLOTING GRADUALLY IMPROVES, BUT PROBLEMS REMAIN 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
5. (SBU) Observers from \"It\'s Your Choice\" said there were 
fewer visible violations during the second balloting on 
September 19, but noted continued administrative glitches and 
problems with unauthorized police presence in most polling 
places.  They also cited evidence of bribery of voters and 
election officials, although these observations were not part 
of their comments to the press.  Local representatives of 
international offices in Yerevan had clearly hoped for 
greater improvement following last year\'s problematic 
presidential and parliamentary elections. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) While the September 19 election did little to change 
the balance of power within the National Assembly, it appears 
to have slightly increased the value of Baghdasaryan\'s 
political stock.  Even though Kocharian appears to have 
brokered the final deal, the withdrawal of the Procurator 
General\'s candidate indicates that Baghdasaryan was either 
more successful in persuading Kocharian to side with his 
candidate or already had more of the President\'s favor in 
comparison to the PG.  Either way, and despite the rumored 
concession prize of a deputy minister spot for the PG\'s 
candidate, Baghdasaryan emerges as the real winner of this 
particular election. 
 
7. (C) The reduction in violations of electoral procedures 
during this poll should not be interpreted as a step forward 
in democratic practices, but merely the absence of a close 
race.  Power structures within the GOAM demonstrated that 
this election in Armenia was still more about dividing the 
spoils of power and influence than about the democratic 
process.

SECTOR 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  This cable provides a brief overview of Armenia\'s 
juice industry for those interested in trade and 
investment opportunities in Armenia.  It also includes 
a list of key contacts in this sector.  For more 
information contact the BISNIS representative or the 
Economic and Commercial Officer at the U.S. Embassy, 
Yerevan.  End Summary. 
 
------------------- 
NATURAL FRUIT JUICE 
------------------- 
 
2.  Juice processing is a growing sector of Armenia\'s 
food processing and packaging industry.  This market 
offers opportunities for U.S. business interested in 
direct investment, exporters of juice concentrates, and 
manufacturers of juice processing and packaging 
equipment.  Juice producers are looking for new 
technologies to expand their shares of the local market 
and to increase exports. 
 
3.  Armenia produces high quality fruits and 
vegetables, which grow mostly in the fertile and well- 
watered Ararat valley between Mount Ararat and Mount 
Aragats.  Over the past five years the fruit juice 
industry has expanded rapidly, and domestic production 
has almost entirely replaced imports.  In 2003 packaged 
natural juice production increased by 70 percent on the 
previous year.  Several fruit juice producers have 
renovated old facilities, installed new processing and 
packaging lines, and used both locally produced and 
imported concentrates to produce higher quality drinks. 
The Armenian natural fruit juice market is divided 
between several privately owned domestic producers, 
including Euroterm, SIS Natural, Tamara Fruit, Yerevan 
Beer, Zovq, and a few fruit juice importers. 
 
--------------- 
LOCAL PRODUCERS 
--------------- 
 
4.  Euroterm JSC:  Established in 1998, Euroterm is now 
the largest local producer of natural fruit juices in 
Armenia.  The company has invested more than USD 5 
million to install a Tetra Pak fruit juice processing 
and packaging line imported from Sweden.  Currently the 
company produces 3 million liters of juice annually in 
1L or 0.25L packages.  In 2003, the company produced 
1,400 tons of juices out which 850 tons were exported 
to Russia, USA, Belarus, Lebanon, France, and Japan. 
Euroterm imports packaging materials, mostly from 
Sweden, and fruit concentrates, mainly exotic fruit 
purees.  Euroterm seeks a foreign partner that could 
increase Euroterm\'s working capital to expand the 
purchases of raw materials.  The company employs 120 
specialists and 300 seasonal employees.

SUBJECT: CASE AGAINST URANIUM SMUGGLER IN DANGER OF 
DISMISSAL 
 
Classified By: CDA A.F.Godfrey for reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
Summary and Action Request 
-------------------------- 
 
1.  (S/NF) Garik Dadayan was detained on the Georgia - 
Armenia border while attempting to smuggle Highly Enriched 
Uranium (HEU) in June 2003.  Dadayan has been in pre-trial 
detention in Armenia, but his case is now moving to trial. 
Prosecutors and the judge presiding in the case are concerned 
that glaring procedural errors, a broken chain of evidence 
and the inability to bring Georgian witnesses to an Armenian 
court could lead to the dismissal of Dadayan\'s case.  We 
underscored our intense interest in this case and asked that 
the GOAM take all appropriate steps to ensure that Dadayan is 
not acquitted on a technicality. 
 
2.  (S/NF) USG engagement in this case could be important to 
a successful outcome.  Dadayan\'s next hearing is scheduled 
for October 18.  The Armenian court is preparing requests to 
the Georgian Ministry of Justice for assistance in ensuring 
witnesses are present.  We may need to underscore to the GOG 
our interest that these requests be honored.  We understand 
the U.S. Department of Energy would be willing to produce a 
detailed analysis of the seized material (which is now in USG 
custody); this would be welcome.  Any assistance we could 
provide in tracing the material to Dadayan would be very 
helpful in securing a guilty verdict.  End Summary and Action 
Request. 
 
Highly Enriched Uranium Seized on the Border 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (S/NF) Garik Dadayan, an Armenian citizen, was detained 
on June 26, 2003 at the state border between Georgia and 
Armenia.  His detention was the result of cooperation between 
intelligence services.  Dadayan was found to be in possession 
of small amounts of substances which were later determined 
(by the USG) to be highly enriched uranium.  This substance 
was provided to the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi on August 23, 
2003 in two small packages of powder, one of 95 grams and one 
of 75 grams.  Although Dadayan has been in GOAM custody for 
over a year, his case is only now moving to trial. 
 
4.  (S/NF) Post used the opportunity of a visit from 
Washington of an attorney-adviser to become familiar with the 
current status of the case.  On September 13, DCM met with 
Nuatsakan Sagsian, Deputy Prosecutor General, Vrezh Simonian, 
Senior Prosecutor of the Investigative Department, and Samvel 
Mnatsakanian, the Prosecutor most directly involved in 
preparing the case for trial.  On September 14, we met with 
Judge Suren Lalayan, who is the presiding judge for this case 
in the Yerevan Center Court of the First Instance. 
 
Prosecution\'s Case in Trouble 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (S/NF) The Prosecutors stated that the case was in 
serious trouble.  First, there were significant procedural 
errors during the period immediately following Dadayan\'s 
arrest by the Georgian authorities.  Paperwork about the 
arrest was completed after the fact and away from the place 
of arrest.  The \"chain of evidence\" had been broken several 
times.  Descriptions of the items seized with Dadayan vary 
significantly in different documents now part of the official 
case file.  Second, prosecutors had not been able to produce 
witnesses to Dadayan\'s arrest in court; while CIS legal 
cooperation agreements exist, they are rarely complied with. 
Prosecutors doubt that they will be able to compel witnesses 
from Georgia to appear in an Armenian court.  \"Dadayan is 
denying everything,\" they said, and has submitted a motion to 
have the case dismissed. 
 
Help Needed to Produce Georgian Witnesses in Armenian Court 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
6.  (S/NF) We urged the Prosecutors to redouble their efforts 
to convince witnesses from Georgia to appear in court.  While 
we could guarantee no results, we would be pleased to ask our 
colleagues in Tbilisi to engage with the GOG to encourage 
Georgian witnesses to appear in court.  The Prosecutors 
demurred, saying that the case is now with the court, and the 
prosecutor has no role in the conduct of the case. 
 
Judge Shares Case File 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (S/NF) During the September 14 meeting with the trial 
judge, we found a more cooperative attitude than with the 
prosecutors, but similarly discouraging results.  Judge 
Lalayan described the same set of problems with documentation 
of the arrest, custody of evidence and with securing 
witnesses\' presence in court.  Because the USG is not a party 
to the case, Lalayan said that it was unlawful for him to 
provide us with copies of either the case file or Dadayan\'s 
appeal for dismissal.  He willingly showed us the file, 
however, and allowed us to make notes.  He also read key 
points of Dadayan\'s motion for dismissal. 
 
USG Documents Weaken Case Against Dadayan 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (S/NF) Lalayan said that circumstances regarding custody 
of the evidence in question, including how the evidence came 
to be in the custody of the USG, would need to be made clear 
to the court.  The case file (which Lalayan showed us) 
contains correspondence ostensibly from the U.S. Embassy in 
Tbilisi which calls into question whether the substance 
seized from Dadayan was radioactive at all.  Lalayan showed 
us a letter dated September 12 2003, unsigned, printed in all 
capital letters on U.S. Embassy letterhead, which stated that 
the sample in question was harmless \"Red Mercury\" and similar 
to material seized in scams in other parts of the world.  A 
second letter, dated February 10, 2004, also unsigned and 
also on U.S. Embassy letterhead stated that the sample 
received was in fact radioactive and a small portion of that 
sample was being returned to the Government of Georgia for 
analysis. 
 
9.  (S/NF) Lalayan welcomed our assertions that the sample 
was actually highly enriched uranium.  He appreciated our 
readiness to provide an analysis of the seized material in a 
form which would be acceptable to the court.  He said that it 
was unlikely that the court would require the physical 
presence of the HEU in the courtroom.  We noted that some 
degree of confusion regarding documentation of Dadayan\'s 
arrest should be understandable by the court; we expressed 
our hope that any decision by the court would not discourage 
further intelligence cooperation. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (S/NF) The Dadayan case is in danger of dismissal, 
although our pressure on the Court and prosecutors may have 
forestalled this outcome for the time being.  If we want a 
guilty verdict, we will need to provide some assistance to 
overcome the procedural foul-ups at the beginning of the 
case.  In order to negate the impact of the 
amateurish-looking September 12 \"Red Mercury\" letter in the 
case file, we will need to provide a professional analysis of 
the material provided.  (Note: Judge Lalayan provided a list 
of criteria during the meeting.  End Note.)  It may prove to 
be a more difficult task to convince witnesses from Georgia 
to appear in an Armenian court, particularly if they are 
associated with intelligence operations.  The toughest task 
will be to convince a court that the chain of evidence was 
not broken and that the material we analyzed is in fact the 
material seized with Dadayan.  The defense attorneys 
evidently are aware of this and are waiting to poke holes in 
the prosecution\'s case.

SUBJECT: REACTION FROM YEREVAN, ARMENIA: PRESS 
CONFERENCE OF AMBASSADOR JOHN EVANS 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: All mass media widely covered the first 
press conference of Ambassador John Evans held on 
September 15.  Virtually all TV stations commented on 
the unique format of the press conference (the heads of 
all the sections of the U.S. mission in Armenia were 
present).  All TV stations showed the introduction of 
the press conference, where Ambassador Evans made 
welcoming remarks in Armenian.  The newspapers also 
paid special attention to both these facts, and carried 
some other commentary as well. 
The following is the summary of those articles. END 
SUMMARY 
 
THE ANSWER TO THE PROVOCATIVE QUESTION 
 
1. Pro-Kocharian HAYOTS ASHKHAR daily (09/16) commented 
on the Ambassador\'s answer to a \"provocative\" question, 
as he put it, regarding the connection of his name with 
possible revolutionary activities in Armenia [as a 
parallel with recent events in Georgia].  \"John Evans, 
half-joking and half-seriously, refused to accept the 
`invitation\' to participate in the revolutionary games 
of the radical opposition.  Talking about the 
settlement of the Karabakh conflict, Evans evaded 
predicting the prospect for settlement of the conflict 
thus diplomatically avoiding the question.\" 
 
THE U.S. AMBASSADOR PRESENTED HIMSELF TO THE MASS MEDIA 
 
2. Opposition newspaper ARAVOT (09/16) referred to the 
presentation of the Embassy section heads in the press 
conference as well as some of the Ambassador\'s answers 
regarding the Karabakh conflict.  \"The newly appointed 
U.S. Ambassador to Armenia John Evans organized his 
first meeting with the journalists in a unique way.  He 
introduced his whole staff to the journalists, 
referring to the responsibilities and merits of each of 
them.\"  \"John Evans\' judgment on the Karabakh conflict 
was as old as the conflict itself.  The U.S. as an 
official Minsk group co-chair will do its best to 
support the negotiation process but the conflicting 
sides should come up with the final settlement 
themselves.\" 
 
EVANS WAS CAREFUL AT HIS FIRST CONFERENCE 
 
3. Radical oppositionist HAYKAKAN ZHAMANAK daily 
(09/16) carried an overall positive impression of the 
press conference, paying special attention to the 
Ambassador\'s personality.  \"Embellishing his first 
press conference with such memories John Evans 
presented the goals and objectives of the U.S.  However 
during the whole conference John Evans abstained from 
making announcements on sharp issues and giving 
assessments.  Mr. Evans used the most neutral and 
hackneyed answers in response to the questions related 
to the opening of the Armenia-Turkish border, Armenia- 
NATO relations, and the development of democracy in 
Armenia.  However it should be noted that the new U.S. 
Ambassador to Armenia made a good impression on people, 
he was not inferior to his predecessor John Ordway in 
the sense of being attractive and polite, and he was 
even smiling a little bit more, at least at first 
sight.\" 
 
WE HIGHLY APPRECIATE ARMENIA\'S ASSISTANCE ON THE IRAQ 
ISSUE 
 
4. Centrist AZG (09/16) daily commented on the way the 
Ambassador answered the questions.  \"The newly 
appointed U.S. Ambassador gave diplomatically brilliant 
answers, i.e. saying everything, he specified nothing. 
It goes without saying that the Ambassador\'s first 
meeting with the journalists was aimed at examining 
them.\" 
 
I AM CONTINUING THE JOB I STARTED 15 YEARS AGO 
 
5. Independent Russian language weekly NOVOYE VREMYA 
(09/18) carried a very positive commentary on the press 
conference.  \"The reaction of the local mass media was 
positive - the journalists liked Evans though some 
opposition newspapers note with disappointment that the 
American diplomat was too careful.  There is a portion 
of truth in that, though carefulness could fully be 
considered as restraint with which the Ambassador was 
answering the questions.\"  \"Most of all the opposition 
press was disappointed with the Ambassador\'s statement 
on progress in practically all spheres in Armenia - be 
it the economy or the formation of democratic 
institutions. They immediately described this phrase as 
`hackneyed.\'\"  \"On the other hand Evans\' portfolio [of 
previous assignments] leads to the conclusion that 
`senseless\' and `hackneyed\' formulations are not 
typical of him.  Even before coming to Armenia Evans 
stated more than once that the main purpose of his 
mission is cooperation in the fields of security, 
stability and economic development in Armenia.  Evans 
communicated with the press with great responsibility. 
He introduced each member of his `new group.\'  Speaking 
of his `assistants\' and `deputies\' he was trying to get 
people to understand that the people representing the 
U.S. in Armenia had been selected with great care.  He 
flattered the press with his confession: `I consider 
journalists as my colleagues.\'\"   \"It seems to me that 
I am continuing the job I started 15 years ago,\" noted 
the Ambassador, humbly not mentioning that in 1988 the 
Soviet Government of Armenia awarded him a medal for 
his efforts\" [working on relief after the 1988 
earthquake].

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) Although much work remains to be done, the 
Armenian government has made considerable efforts over 
the past three years and, despite being a country of 
origin for trafficking, has graduated from Tier 3 to 
Tier 2 (Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report 2004). 
Government actions have had the following results:  in 
2002 the GOAM established an Inter-Agency Commission on 
TIP and in 2004 it created a Law Enforcement Commission 
on TIP; the GOAM Department for Migration and Refugees 
(DMR) has maintained a Migrants Service Point and a 
hotline for prevention of irregular migration and 
trafficking; and the Prosecutor General\'s Office has 
investigated a number of cases on trafficking and 
pimping, several of which resulted in convictions and 
jail sentences.  The GOAM has signed an agreement on 
implementing a large-scale program on anti-TIP with the 
United Nations Development Program (UNDP).  US 
assistance plays an important role in ensuring 
continued progress on TIP issues.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
GOVERNMENT ANTI-TIP COMMISSIONS 
------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The GOAM Inter-Agency Commission on TIP draws 
members from a number of State bodies:  the MFA, 
Department on Migration and Refugees (DMR), Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs, National Police, Border 
Troops, and the Prosecutor General\'s Office. 
International organizations and local NGOs, under an 
expanded UN Theme Group on Anti-Trafficking, serve as 
experts and consultants for the commission.  This 
Commission, with assistance from the UN Theme Group, 
developed a Concept Paper and a National Plan of 
Actions (NPA) on Counter Trafficking, which the 
Government approved on January 15, 2004.  The creation 
of the Law Enforcement Commission (LEC) on anti-TIP 
started as a result of US-Armenian cooperation. 
According to Advisor to the Foreign Minister Karen 
Nazaryan, the LEC will have the following goals:  to 
make the anti-TIP efforts of law enforcement bodies 
more effective and to ensure funding for implementation 
of anti-TIP programs. 
 
--------------------- 
UNDP ANTI-TIP PROJECT 
--------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The UNDP, in cooperation with the GOAM and in 
line with the NPA, designed and implemented a program 
on Capacity Building and Victims Assistance.  The 
approximate cost of the project is USD 620,000--Norway 
and the Netherlands are the donors--and the project got 
underway in May 2004.  The UNDP is implementing the 
project together with the United Methodist Committee on 
Relief (UMCOR) and International Organization on 
Migration (IOM).  The UNDP project has three 
components:  capacity building framework for 
institutional strengthening and policy elaboration, 
awareness raising and victims assistance.  UMCOR 
maintains a shelter and a hotline for TIP victims. 
UMCOR is increasing efforts to raise public awareness 
about the project and the problem of trafficking. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
DMR MIGRANTS SERVICE POINT AND HOTLINE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The Deputy Head of DMR, Lyalya Aslanyan, told 
us that trafficking issues are part of a larger program 
of DMR on prevention of illegal migration.  The 
Department has established a Migrants Service Point 
(MSP) with a hotline for answering potential migrants\' 
questions.  IOM and the USG funded the hotline for its 
first year as part of a program called \"Awareness 
Campaign on Irregular Migration,\" the DMR now maintains 
the service point.  MSP workers explain foreign 
countries\' regulations on illegal employment, and 
inform callers about various situations (including 
trafficking risks) people may encounter while seeking 
jobs abroad.  According to a survey conducted by the 
Armenian Sociological Association, there was a 25 
percent increase in the number of persons aware of the 
real situation for illegal migrants, compared with data 
collected before the Awareness Campaign and the launch 
of MSP.  In addition to this, the DMR has developed 
three programs on anti-trafficking aimed at raising 
public awareness in the Armenian regions, assisting the 
victims of trafficking and conducting an in-depth 
research of the situation with labor trafficking.  The 
Department is in the process of identifying sources for 
possible funding of those projects. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF PIMPING AND TRAFFICKING 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (SBU) Nelly Harutyunyan, the Foreign Liaison of the 
Prosecutor General\'s Office, provided us with the 
following data on cases involving trafficking and 
pimping for 2003-2004.  Eight cases were investigated 
on charges of Article 262 of the Criminal Code, 
Organization of Prostitution (i.e., pimping).  Out of 
this number, 5 cases involving 12 people have already 
been successfully prosecuted, 2 cases involving 2 
people have been suspended as the suspects have fled, 
and one case involving 3 people is still under 
investigation.  On charges of Article 132 of the 
Criminal Code, Trafficking in Humans, one case 
involving trafficking of a child is in progress.  The 
\"Association of Investigative Journalists\" NGO follows 
the investigation and trials of trafficking cases, and 
according to NGO president Edik Baghdasaryan most of 
the pimping cases were, in fact, trafficking. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
PUNISHMENT TERMS FOR TRAFFICKING AND PIMPING 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Punishments envisaged by Article 132 of the 
Criminal Code on Trafficking in Humans include:  fines 
(of up to a current maximum of USD 12,000), corrective 
labor (maximum 1 year), detention (maximum 2 months), 
and imprisonment (from 1-4 years).  In the presence of 
aggravating factors (e.g., trafficking in minors, 
crossing borders illegally) the length of imprisonment 
may range from 4-7 years, and in case of death of the 
victim, from 5-8 years.  Article 262 on the 
Organization of Prostitution stipulates the following 
punishments:  fines (of up to a current maximum of USD 
12,000), corrective labor (maximum 2 years), and 
imprisonment (from 1-4 years).  If the perpetrator is a 
law enforcement official, prison terms can range from 2- 
6 years, if the victim is a minor, the terms range from 
3-10 years. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
COMMENT: GOAM MAKING PROGRESS, STILL A LONG WAY TO GO 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7. (U) GOAM actions over the past three years are a 
good start, and the first, crucial step of getting 
Armenians to acknowledge the problem.  Government 
officials, as well as society as a whole, now 
acknowledge the problem\'s existence.  The change of law 
enforcement and official mentality is clear and is 
reflected in regular, official media reporting on 
trafficking cases and frequent NGO activities in this 
field.  More work remains, however, to improve and 
strengthen anti-TIP legislation, and to develop 
effective mechanisms to identify trafficking victims.

(U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) GOAM commitment to deploying troops in Iraq 
remains strong despite recent media statements and 
public opinion against the mission.  Opposition groups 
have not strongly attacked plans for deployment, and 
Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
officials continue to make consistent statements in 
support of the mission, indicating unwavering resolve 
within the GOAM.  The GOAM sees clear benefits from 
participation that can only be realized through troop 
deployment.  End Summary. 
 
-------------- 
PUBLIC DISSENT 
-------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Immediately after Armenian President Kocharian 
signed an agreement with the president of Poland laying 
the groundwork for deployment on September 6, several 
opposition newspapers criticized the decision (reftel). 
Articles cited a disgruntled general\'s criticism of the 
deployment and several editors worried that the move 
would negatively affect Armenia\'s relations with 
Russia, jeopardize Armenian national security, and 
endanger ethnic Armenians in Iraq.  Several small NGOs 
such as \"Soldiers\' Mothers\" and \"Republican Women\'s 
Council\" have since stated their opposition to 
deployment, and on October 1, the news weekly \"Iravunk\" 
published an informal (small and unscientific) public 
opinion survey in which six percent of Armenians stated 
their support of Armenian deployment to Iraq, while 
sixty percent stated their strong opposition. 
 
3. (SBU) Despite the initial media outcry, only one of 
the major opposition figures, Artashes Geghamian, 
issued a statement against the deployment at the time 
the agreement with Poland became public, and none of 
the opposition leaders has made public statements on 
the issue since.  The disgruntled general has softened 
his public statements, and while some newspapers 
continue to question why Russia was not consulted in 
this matter, their coverage has become less shrill and 
even, on occasions, balanced. 
 
------------------ 
STAYING THE COURSE 
------------------ 
 
4. (SBU) In a September 30 interview, Defense Minister 
Serzh Sargsian reasoned that if the GOAM wants Western 
military assistance and argues that this assistance 
must be equally distributed among the nations of the 
South Caucasus, then Armenia must shoulder an equal 
burden along with Georgia and Azerbaijan by deploying 
troops in Iraq and possibly Afghanistan.  He further 
sought to reassure the public that Russia remains 
Armenia\'s most important international partner and key 
to Armenian national defense planning.  These arguments 
are consistent with views expressed to us over the past 
month by diverse sectors of the GOAM including the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense. 
This unity of message within the GOAM usually indicates 
a strong resolve at the highest levels. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) The GOAM perceives a genuine need to send 
troops to Iraq.  The MFA NATO desk officer has often 
stated his concern that the West too often views 
Armenia as a friend of Russia and Iran at the expense 
of Western relations.  He fears that Armenia would be 
\"left behind\" as Georgia and Azerbaijan integrate more 
closely with the Europe.  Along with recent agreements 
to pursue an Individual Partnership Plan with NATO, the 
GOAM sees cooperation in Iraq as an important means to 
remain politically linked to the West.

OSKANIAN STUNS DIPLOMATIC CROWD

2. (SBU) Taking advantage of the official reception 
October 2 on the occasion of the \"Day of German 
Unity,\" Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian called for 
\"Armenian reunification\" first in an Armenian 
version of his remarks, followed immediately by the 
same comments in English.  Oskanian called for the 
reunification of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh to 
outbursts of applause (when he made the comment in 
Armenian) and to stunned, muted chatter when he 
repeated his remarks in English. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
REMARKS PLANNED, THOUGH NOT FULLY SCRIPTED 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) One of Oskanian\'s senior advisors, coming 
to stand next to us during the remarks, highlighted 
them, noting that they had been discussed in 
advance, and that the Minister intended his remarks 
to refer only to N-K and not to so-called \"Western 
Armenia.\"  With the entire diplomatic corps in 
attendance, it is unlikely that Oskanian expected 
his remarks to go unreported.  What is not clear is 
precisely what he hoped to gain with his statement. 
MFA press spokesman Vladimir Karepetyan backed off 
Oskanian\'s remarks somewhat in an October 4 
statement, but officially confirmed that, \"In his 
speech on the occasion of the Day of German Unity, 
Minister Oskanian expressed the hope that one day 
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh will have the 
opportunity to reunite.\"

SUMMARY

2. (SBU) Per reftel we delivered talking points on 
piracy of intellectual property to Deputy Minister 
of Trade Tigran Davtyan, October 6.  Davtyan 
expressed interest in the Strategy Targeting 
Organized Piracy (STOP) and said that he and the 
Minister are always ready to work with us to address 
the problem of piracy in Armenia.  (Note:  Pirated 
optical disks --music, films, and software -- are 
ubiquitous in Armenia.  End Note.) 
 
3. (SBU) Davtyan added that the Ministry of Trade 
has been pressuring the police to instate a proposed 
Intellectual Property Enforcement Team.  Although 
the Ministry of Finance has set aside money for the 
team, other parts of government, notably the 
Ministry of Justice, are resisting the idea. 
Critics claim that the team will simply be another 
place for corrupt police who seek only to collect 
bribes.  Davtyan also said that any pressure to 
enforce IPR laws would work best if met by supply 
side alternatives:  licensed copies of western CDs 
or DVDs are currently impossible to find in Armenia, 
and the economy cannot support international prices 
for licensed merchandise.  Unless some Armenian 
could work out some way of getting licensed IP goods 
cheaper, any enforcement effort would be like 
squeezing balloon, Davtyan said.

1. (U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
-------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
2. (SBU) As a result of the Russian-Georgian border 
closure roughly one thousand trucks bound for 
Armenia are stuck at the Verkhniy Lars border 
crossing point between Russia and Georgia. 
According to Deputy Minister of Trade Tigran 
Davtyan, the situation \"is not tragic--but will 
create some additional costs.\"  The closure has 
created significant difficulties for the companies 
that currently have large shipments halted at the 
border:  to reroute now will add thirty percent to 
transport costs and is bureaucratically cumbersome. 
Importers are rerouting new shipments though the 
Ukraine, which will add about 10 percent to 
transport costs for Russian goods.  The GOAM has 
approached the Russian government \"at the highest 
level\" to solve the situation at recently as October 
6, but to no avail.  The Russian government 
maintains that the closed border is an issue of 
terrorism control and, while expressing sympathy for 
the impact on Armenia, has offered no timeline to 
reopen the border.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
GEORGIA - RUSSIA BORDER CLOSED AFTER BESLAN ATTACKS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3. (SBU) The Russian government closed the Verkhiny 
Lars border crossing with Georgia immediately 
following the September 1 attack at the Beslan 
School.  In an official visit to Armenia at the 
beginning of October, Sergey Mironov, Chairman of 
the Russian Federation Council, stated that the 
border closure was mandated by the existing threat 
of terrorism in North Ossetia and was not directed 
against cargo transport to Armenia.  Russian 
officials have told the GOAM that Russia has a 
legitimate concern that terrorists are entering 
North Ossetia from Georgia. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
ARMENIA TO DIVERT RUSSIAN IMPORTS THROUGH BLACK SEA 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4. (SBU) The lion\'s share of Armenia\'s imports 
transit Georgian territory, and nearly all imports 
from Russia (15 percent of Armenia\'s imports) came 
across the Verkhiny Lars border before September 1. 
Nearly one thousand trucks bound for Armenia are 
currently at the border awaiting special permission 
to continue into Armenia.  According to Davtyan, in 
a few exceptional cases the Russian border guards 
permitted some trucks to cross in the first days of 
the closure, but now the border is completely 
closed.  Importers are beginning to reroute trucks 
through the Ukraine to the Georgian seaport of Poti, 
and then overland to Armenia, adding thirty percent 
to transport costs for those trucks currently stuck 
at the border. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
CLOSURE VIEWED AS MORE OR LESS PERMANENT 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The GOAM notes that the Russian government 
has not provided them a timeline for reopening the 
border.  Although Armenia and Russia are strategic 
allies, the GOAM has accepted Russia\'s explanation 
for the closure and the Ministry of Trade has told 
Armenian importers to seek alternative import 
routes.  Although the closure is hurting those 
companies that currently have goods halted at the 
border, the long-term effects will be slight 
additional transport costs on Armenian\'s imports 
from Russia.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) On October 1, Armenia\' Public Service Regulatory 
Commission (PRSC) ended ArmEnergo\'s reign as the state-owned 
single buyer of midstream electricity, responding to demands 
of the donor community (including the United States as part 
of the most recent US-Armenia Task Force action plan).  The 
GOAM has fulfilled only part of its obligation:  it has 
failed, however, to implement the necessary market rules and 
energy cost adjustment mechanisms to protect the energy 
market from price instability and rent seeking.  Without 
such measures, the dissolution of ArmEnergo makes the 
private energy distributor and generating companies part of 
a market without rules and no secured payment mechanism.  It 
is unclear what will happen if energy input prices rise, but 
the distributor has no right to pass costs onto consumers. 
Sources from the Ministry of Energy point out that the 
Ministry maintained significant control of Armenia\'s energy 
sector through its ownership of the Vorotan Cascade, 
Armenia\'s largest hydro-electric plant, Transmission Network 
and Power System Operation.  End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
WHAT HAPPENS NOW? 
----------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Until last week, ArmEnergo acted as a single-buyer 
single-seller mediator of electricity, in effect making the 
Government of Armenia the guarantor of the Armenian energy 
sector.  The Ministry of Energy used ArmEnergo to keep end- 
use prices stable when generation costs fluctuated.  Now the 
privately owned electricity distributor, Electricity 
Networks of Armenia (ElNetArm) must take over the financial 
responsibility for the sector.  This basically has shifted 
the single-buyer responsibility from ArmEnergo to ElNetArm, 
who currently must provide electricity at regulated tariffs 
even if costs rise.  The Public Service Regulatory 
Commission (PSRC) has failed to establish an energy 
adjustment fund or adopt an adjustment clause, which would 
give the distributor the right to raise electricity prices 
for end-users, upon PSRC\'s review, when the average 
generation costs rise.  The PSRC has prepared a draft Law to 
provide the mechanism for funds flow and tariff adjustment; 
we expect this will come before the National Assembly in 
October. 
 
------------------------- 
MINISTRY TO KEEP CONTROL? 
------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Sources close to the Ministry of Energy say that 
the Ministry intends to maintain its control of the market 
through its ownership of the Vorotan Cascade, a hydro-plant 
that supplies nearly 20 percent of the energy market. 
Because hydroelectricity makes up the cheapest share of 
Armenia\'s energy, the government has the flexibility to use 
Vorotan\'s output to trade electricity and influence over-all 
energy costs to the distributor.  The government\'s control 
of Vorotan also presents opportunities for profits:  the 
GOAM is currently exporting the plant\'s cheap electricity to 
Iran, to pay the debt on constructing a new transmission 
line and for a substation upgrade used for transactions with 
Iran.  (Note:  Normally Armenia would \"bank\" this energy in 
an energy swap where Armenia exports electricity in the 
summer to Iran and imports electricity in the winter from 
Iran.  End Note.)  The Ministry of Energy\'s project will 
likely increase Armenia\'s need for higher-priced electricity 
(generated in gas-fired plants), for which consumers will 
ultimately pay significantly higher prices. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
COMMENT:  REMOVAL OF ARMENERGO NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5. (SBU) International donors have long sought to separate 
ArmEnergo and the Ministry\'s functions as a supplier of 
electricity in order to reduce the capacity for corruption 
in the energy sector.  But the Ministry is reluctant to cede 
complete control of the energy sector to private 
enterprises.  The removal of ArmEnergo is a necessary but 
not sufficient step to withdrawing the Ministry from the 
energy sector.  Until the Public Service Regulatory 
Commission establishes market rules governing private (as 
well as public) actors as well as some safeguards to deal 
with energy supply and financial settlements, there will not 
be a viable private energy market.  For now the Ministry\'s 
involvement in the energy sector will continue to create 
opportunities for rent seeking by those who control the 
government\'s energy assets.

1. (C) In her October 14 meeting with Armenian Foreign 
Minister Vartan Oskanian, Deputy Assistant Secretary Laura 
Kennedy emphasized the positive benefits for Armenia of a 
Turkey anchored in the EU.  She strongly urged the GOAM avoid 
trying to derail or complicate the process.  Oskanian\'s 
recent public comments against \"premature\" Turkish-EU 
accession talks and President Kocharian\'s October 12 letter 
to EU presidents on the issue indicate that Armenia\'s 
concerns could both complicate its relations with Turkey and 
unhelpfully affect the public debate on Turkish-EU accession, 
particularly in problematic countries such as France (where 
Oskanian pointedly noted the presence of a 400,000-member 
Armenian community).  Over the course of their discussion, 
Oskanian gave DAS Kennedy a copy of the letter that President 
Robert Kocharian has just sent to all EU presidents raising 
Armenian concerns with the possibility of Turkish accession 
to the EU. 
 
2. (C) Kennedy noted that the recently-adopted Turkish penal 
code itself does not mention Armenia but rather it is cited 
in a legal reasoning (reftel).  She urged Armenia not to 
overreact to this development which appeared to take both 
Turkish and EU officials off guard.  She was confident that 
efforts to remove or void such an interpretation would be 
successful as criminalizing free speech was inconsistent with 
EU (or American) norms. 
 
3. (C) While she agreed that it was appropriate for Armenia 
to raise its concerns, she urged discretion and keeping the 
larger picture in mind.  She also noted that issues such as 
Turkey\'s closed land border with Armenia are not part of the 
EU\'s Copenhagen criteria.  That said, Turkey\'s bid to join 
the EU offered a dynamic backdrop for movement on a range of 
issues.  The U.S., of course, urges Turkey to open its border 
with Armenia.  She noted, however, that Turkey always cites 
Armenian occupation of Azerbaijan as the constraint on its 
ability to move on Armenia. Armenia should keep public focus 
at home and abroad on the positive prospects of EU accession 
for Turkey.  Oskanian did agree on the overall benefits to 
Armenia of Turkey in the EU. 
 
4. (C) Full text of the Kocharian letter (original in 
English) follows.  Begin text: 
 
Dear Mr. President, 
 
The European Commission recommendations on the Turkish 
accession process forces me to write to you with two major 
concerns. 
 
Let me be clear that my concerns are not borne of our own 
bilateral differences with Turkey.  We have said from the 
start that a Turkey that fulfills the conditions for EU 
membership and is deserving of the European label should 
indeed be allowed to join the EU.  Armenia would only welcome 
a neighbor which is democratic and tolerant, one whose 
foreign policy is indeed \'in line with the EU\' and one whose 
membership means Armenia will border the EU. 
 
However, your decision to begin accession talks with Turkey 
does, from our perspective, already bend the rules.  Turkey 
will receive the green light for accession talks despite two 
major fundamental wrongs. 
 
First, recent press coverage of Turkey\'s penal code focused 
on the sensational parts, and completely ignored the explicit 
rejection of tolerance and freedom of expression.  Rather 
than encouraging democratic, free, open, public discourse on 
the difficult topics of Cyprus and Armenians, Article 306 of 
the Turkish Penal Code criminalizes expressions of support 
for the withdrawal of Turkish forces from Cyprus, and 
affirmation of the occurrence of the Armenian Genocide.  To 
say, as the EU recommendations do, that \'As regards freedom 
of expression, the situation has improved significantly\' is 
to say that the EU is willing to ignore these flagrant 
violations of basic freedoms. 
 
Second, given that Turkey\'s borders with Armenia remain 
closed, we do not believe that \'Turkish foreign policy is 
contributing positively to regional stability.\'  We do not 
believe Turkey\'s foreign policy regarding its neighboring 
countries is simply \'less in line\' with the EU\'s.  We want to 
believe it is completely in contradiction to the EU\'s 
policies of enlargement and inclusion, particularly as it 
affects us in the New Neighborhood. 
 
We would not want the EU to lose its moral authority and 
credibility, when it, on the one hand, tells us and our 
neighbors to affect reforms, but on the other hand, is 
willing to look the other way when another of our neighbors 
actively maintains a contradictory, unacceptable policy. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Robert Kocharian

SUBJECT: (IMI) OVERVIEW OF ARMENIA\'S WINE SECTOR 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  This cable provides a brief overview of Armenia\'s 
wine sector for those considering trade and investment 
opportunities in Armenia.  It also includes a list of 
key contacts.  For more information contact the BISNIS 
representative or the Economic and Commercial Officer 
at the U.S. Embassy in Yerevan.  End Summary. 
 
2.  In Armenia\'s growing wine industry local producers 
are searching for foreign partners to find new markets 
for their products.  Some of them need to upgrade their 
facilities and are planning to purchase modern bottling 
and packaging equipment.  Many of them need investments 
in working capital due to the seasonal nature of the 
industry.  U.S. exporters may find many marketing 
possibilities as the wine sectors expand. 
 
---------------------- 
WINE INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
---------------------- 
 
3.  Armenia is one of the world\'s ancient grape growing 
and processing societies:  Armenian winemaking dates 
back at least 3,000 years.  Industrial winemaking began 
in Armenia during the 1870s.  During the Soviet period 
Armenia expanded and improved its wine production and 
Armenian wines won a number of grands prix and dozens 
of gold and silver medals in international wine tasting 
events.  But the collapse of the Soviet Union heralded 
a collapse in Armenia\'s wine industry.  There is less 
total area of vineyards under cultivation and less 
total wine production today than twenty years ago. 
After 1995, the state began privatizing Armenia\'s 
wineries; fourteen out of thirty wineries remain as 
joint stock companies.  Recently, winemakers have begun 
recovering vineyards and establishing new wineries. 
The traditional assortment of Armenian wines is 
returning to the market and new labels are being 
established.  According to local experts, wine making 
is now one of the most profitable branches of Armenia\'s 
economy with excellent potential for expansion. 
 
4.  Currently, according to different estimates there 
are 14,000 hectares of vineyards in Armenia. 
Approximately 30-40 percent of these are used to 
cultivate grapes reserved for wine making, including 
the following: 
 
WINE TYPE                         GRAPE TYPE 
 
Select white table wine:      Voskehat, Banants 
Ordinary white table wine:    Voskehat, Rkatseteli, 
                              Mskhali, Garan Dmak 
Table red wine:               Areni, Kakhet, Saperavi 
Ordinary red table wine:      Saperavi, Kakhet, 
                              Cabernet 
Select red table wine:        Muscat, Voskehat, 
                              Arevik, Kakhet, Areni 
Ordinary desert wine:         Muscat, Kakhet, Saperavi 
Fortified dessert wine:       Voskehat, Voskahet 
 
The main grape growing and winemaking areas in Armenia 
are the Ararat valley, including the provinces of 
Ararat (the towns of Artashat and Vedi) and Armavir 
(the towns of Echmiadzin and Armavir), the northeast 
region (Ijevan, Tavush province), Aragtsotn province 
(the town of Ashtarak and Byurakan village), Vayots 
Dzor province (villages of Areni, Getap, town of 
Yeghegnadzor,) and Syunik province (Meghri). 
 
5.  The largest grape growing and processing center in 
the country is the Vayots Dzor province.  The province 
is famous for its Black Areni variety, which makes red 
table and semi-dry wines.  As wine making has become 
one of Armenia\'s most profitable businesses, local 
farmers are steadily increasing cultivation of grapes 
in the province.  There are now several wineries in 
Vayots Dzor province.  In March 1999, the last state- 
owned winery was privatized.  A number of new wineries 
have since opened. 
 
6.  Areni Joint Stock Company is the first private 
winery in Vayots Dzor.  Established in 1994, it 
produces a wine from the special Areni grape variety. 
The winery has participated in a number of trade shows 
and exhibitions both in Armenia and abroad.  More 
recently established private wineries in Vayots Dzor 
include Ginetas, producing a dry red table and a semi- 
sweet, Van 777, Kimley\'s and Gatnatun.  Ginekar Company 
produces wine kept for aging to be sold outside of 
Armenia in luxury hotels. 
 
7.  Armenia\'s largest wine enterprise is Getap.  It is 
a part of the Ararat province-based company Vedi-Alko 
JSC, which is the leading producer of wine and vodka in 
Armenia.  The company was established in 1999 as a 
result of a merger of two large Armenian wineries Vedi 
and Getap, and the largest vodka producer Vedi llc. 
Currently, it produces more than 30 varieties of table 
and dessert wines, sparkling wines, and vodkas.  The 
company\'s Vernashen semi-sweet wine is one of the most 
popular brands in Armenia.  Vedi-Alko exports its 
products to Russia, Ukraine, France, the United States, 
United Kingdom, and Poland. 
 
8.  Established in 1976, the Ijevan Winery became an 
open joint stock company in 1995.  This winery has 
successfully converted a Soviet winery into an 
efficient modern shop.  The winery is equipped with 
modern grape processing and wine bottling lines 
imported from Germany.  It produces several types of 
wines, including dessert red, semi-dessert, white dry 
table, red dry table, and rose dry table. In 2003, the 
company\'s sales increased six-fold to 234,000 bottles 
from its 1999 level.  The company exports its products 
to Russia, Japan and the United States. 
 
9.  Established in 1877, the Yerevan Ararat Cognac-Wine- 
Vodka Factory is one of the oldest enterprises in 
Armenia.  Nationalized in 1921, the enterprise grew to 
become the Ararat trust, Armenia\'s central vintage 
wine, cognac and vodka production center, whose sales 
accounted for 25 percent of Soviet Armenia\'s state 
revenue.  Privatized in October 1996, the Yerevan 
Ararat Wine Factory recently became part of a large 
Armenian company Multi Group.  Currently, the company 
produces various vintage Armenian wines and aged 
Armenian cognacs.  The enterprise owns a rich stock of 
wines, wine materials, Armenian cognac and cognac 
spirits.

SUBJECT: (IMI) OVERVIEW OF ARMENIA\'S DIAMOND-CUTTING 
INDUSTRY 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  This cable reviews the diamond-cutting industry in 
Armenia as of October 2004.  It includes an overview and 
contact information for major diamond-cutting enterprises 
and a discussion of the possible advantages in Armenia for 
foreign investment.  End summary. 
 
2.  Diamond processing has been one of the most rapidly 
developing industries in Armenia.  By value, diamonds are 
now Armenia\'s largest export and import.  In value-added 
terms the industry\'s production has risen from USD 89 
million in 1999 to USD 250 million in 2003.  All the large 
diamond factories have capacity for expansion, and are open 
to any foreign cooperation that can help them procure 
supplies of raw diamonds, the industry\'s limiting factor. 
 
3.  Before independence, Armenia boasted one of the seven 
large Soviet diamond-cutting plants.  Armenia still has a 
generous allowance of raw diamonds under Russia\'s export 
quota system, but the rising price of Russian diamonds has 
meant that the quotas have gone unfilled while diamond 
processors have turned to other suppliers and agreements 
with western firms. 
 
4.  Currently, there are about 50 companies active in 
diamond cutting in Armenia.  They can be divided into three 
groups: 
 
--  Foreign-owned companies that ship their own diamonds to 
Armenia for processing (Shoghakn, Arevakn, Lori, and 
Diamotec Factories); 
 
--  Companies that buy raw diamonds from their own suppliers 
and sell the finished product through their own distribution 
channels (Diamond Company of Armenia); and 
 
--  Locally-owned companies that polish diamonds on a fee- 
for-service basis for foreign customers who supply the uncut 
diamonds and take back the finished products (Andranik, 
Aghavni, Dzoragyugh factories). 
 
5.  Armenia\'s largest diamond factories are those wholly 
owned by foreign firms who are both the primary supplier and 
client.  Belgium\'s Arslanian Cutting Works, owned by Haik 
Arslanian, an ethnic Armenian businessman from Antwerp, 
employs about 400 diamond cutters in its Lori factory that 
produces USD 75 million in diamonds annually.  The Belgian 
company Tashe operates a smaller diamond cutting plant, 
Arevakn, in the village of Nor Hajn, Kotayk province.  In 
the same village Russian-Israeli businessman Lev Leviyev 
owns a processing plant that employs nearly 1,500 cutters 
and exports its entire product for sale in Israel.  The 
Belgian luxury jewelry company Rosy Blue owns and supplies 
the Diamotec polishing company, which employs 700 diamond 
cutters in the town of Talin, Aragatsotn province. 
 
6.  The Diamond Company of Armenia (DCA) produces USD 30 
million of cut diamonds annually.  Unlike the other large 
diamond factories, DCA is independently owned and finds its 
own suppliers of raw diamonds and controls the distribution 
of its product.  DCA employs 1,000 people. 
 
7.  Several smaller Armenian firms (namely, the Andranik, 
Aghavni, Dzoragyugh factories) finish diamonds and other 
gems on a fee-for-service basis.  For interested investors, 
Armenia\'s diamond industry offers the following advantages: 
 
-  Availability of inexpensive, highly qualified diamond 
cutters; 
-  Availability of modern equipment at the existing plants; 
-  No taxes on imports of raw materials and exports of 
finished products; 
-  No taxes on repatriation of profit; and 
-  Government support of the industry aimed to facilitate 
new investment.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) An independent TV news broadcast produced by 
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty was cancelled on 
October 13 after airing a single episode.  The director 
of the station denied government pressure.  We believe, 
however, that this incident was an act of self- 
censorship to avoid conflict with the government, which 
keeps a tight rein on broadcast media.  End Summary 
 
------------------ 
RFE/RL\'S SHORT RUN 
------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) On October 10 and 11, Kentron television aired 
the only episode of a news program it produced in 
cooperation with RFE/RL.  According to executives at 
Kentron and other media accounts, the public received 
the show favorably, but on October 13, Kentron dropped 
it from the schedule.  Local opposition media and the 
RFE/RL service director in Prague speculated publicly 
that the government had forced Kentron to drop its 
cooperation with RFE/RL.  Kentron director Petros 
Ghazarian, however, told us that no one representing 
the GOAM had contacted Kentron about the program. 
 
------------ 
OVERSHADOWED 
------------ 
 
3. (SBU) Kentron is often regarded as the \"opposition\" 
television station because of its managerial 
association with several opposition newspapers, and 
also because the station produces some of the more 
balanced television news in Yerevan.  It lives in the 
shadow of A1-plus, an opposition television station 
that went off the air in 2002.  (Note:  Human rights 
groups believe A1-plus lost its license largely because 
of its support of the opposition.  End Note.)  Kentron 
began broadcasting on the same frequency shortly after 
the closure of A1-plus.  In the past, Kentron has held 
back its on-air personalities, sometimes replacing 
reporters who became \"too political,\" effectively 
censoring themselves. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  THINGS THAT GET BUMPED IN THE NIGHT 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Whether or not it is justified, Kentron 
station management believes that the GOAM got rid of A1- 
plus, and Kentron is willing to self-censor in an 
effort to stay on the air.  One viewer of the RFE/RL 
program praised the station for the show but asked, 
\"will they [the authorities] let you go on?\"  We will 
never know because Kentron television executives pulled 
the plug themselves.

ASSAILANT SENTENCED TO JAIL 
--------------------------- 
 
(SBU) On October 11, the Court of First Instance of 
Kotayk region sentenced Gagik Stepanyan to six months 
in jail for assaulting two journalists.  Stepanyan was 
convicted for roughing up Mkhitar Khachatryan, a 
photojournalist with the Photolur News Agency, and 
Aravot Daily reporter Anna Israelyan on August 24.  The 
journalists were working on a report on environmental 
damage caused by construction in a resort area when the 
incident occurred (refs A and B).  Prosecutor Koryun 
Piloyan demanded a six-month sentence for the 
defendant, citing a recent increase in crimes against 
journalists.  The court agreed.  (Note:  The defendant, 
who was arrested on August 26, has served more than one 
third of his term in pre-trial detention and is already 
theoretically eligible for early release.  End Note.) 
This is the first prison sentence for assaulting a 
reporter in Armenia.  Media watchers have hailed this 
as a positive development.

SUBJECT: GENDER AND SALARY DISCRIMINATION IN YEREVAN 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) According to a new survey, equally qualified 
men and women in Yerevan receive wildly disparate 
salaries:  on average, women in Yerevan receive 40 
percent less than men.  While the survey was too small 
to be entirely reliable, the trends it demonstrated are 
strongly supported by anecdotal evidence.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
AEPLAC SURVEY RESULTS 
--------------------- 
 
2. (U) The Armenian-European Policy and Legal Advice 
Center (AEPLAC) together with the Armenian Sociological 
Center recently presented the results of a June survey 
on discrimination trends in the Yerevan labor market. 
The survey aimed to reveal whether such factors as 
gender, social status, place of residence and 
nationality play a role in determining the salary.  The 
survey results are based on limited salary data 
gathered from only 396 people.  The survey contacted 
1000 randomly selected respondents, of whom 599 
technically belonged to the work force, only 420 
respondents were actually employed.  Of those who were 
employed, 396 respondents agreed to share their salary 
information.  According to the survey results, while 
men in Yerevan receive an average salary of 368.4 
Armenian Drams (AMD) per hour (roughly USD 0.72), women 
receive only 236.0 AMD (roughly USD 0.45).  The average 
proportion of married men in the workforce (84.4 
percent of all surveyed men) is higher than that of 
women (67.7 percent of all surveyed women.)  In order 
to find the reasons for these differences the 
researchers processed the data through an econometrical 
model. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
EDUCATION AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE SKILLS MATTER 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) AEPLAC found that each year of education and a 
strong knowledge of a foreign language increase the 
salary by 4.1 percent and 17.6 percent, respectively. 
Nonetheless, single women in Yerevan are paid 42.3 
percent less than single men, while married women are 
paid 46.9 percent less than married men.  AEPLAC cites 
this as an obvious example of gender discrimination. 
The location of jobs also influences salary:  people 
working in downtown Yerevan earn 63.5 percent higher 
salaries than those working in outlying suburbs. 
 
------------------- 
\"EXPERTS\" IN DENIAL 
------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Gender experts and NGO representatives note 
that the situation with gender discrimination in 
Yerevan labor market was complex and varied by sectors; 
these same experts admit, however, that they had never 
considered salary discrepancies as discrimination, 
noting that they had focused their attention on the 
availability of jobs.  The current labor market is so 
small that professional qualification is the only major 
criteria, and gender is irrelevant, one of the local 
experts maintains.  This AEPLAC survey, however, 
demonstrates that gender discrimination exists and is a 
continuing problem in both the public and private 
sector.

1. (C) On 19 October, the Armenian press reported that an 
Armenian citizen, Gagik Tovmasyan, was arrested on Oct 19 
while transporting Cesium-137.  National Security Service 
officials confirmed this during an Oct 19 meeting. Ashot 
Martirosyan, Head of the Armenian Nuclear Regulatory Agency, 
verified that two curies of radioactive cesium-137 were 
seized from Tovmasyan on October 15.  Martirosyan told us 
that the radioactive material was being transported in the 
original specialized container in the trunk of a car and if 
the cesium-137 had leaked it could have posed a serious 
health hazard to anyone who came in contact with it. 
Martirosyan told us the cesium-137 had since been placed in a 
government storage facility and rendered harmless. 
 
2. (C) Martirosyan noted that the Armenian National Security 
Service (NSS) had the lead on the investigation and he had no 
further details on where the material was seized, and why the 
Armenian citizen was in possession of it. 
 
3. (C) An official representative from the NSS told us that 
the seizure of the cesium-137 was the result of a sting 
operation and the investigation was ongoing.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) The Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) is 
increasing its efforts to support ongoing Armenian 
government-sponsored repopulation programs in 
Nagrono-Karabakh (N-K) through its \"Centennial Project.\"  The 
AGBU, the Armenian Diaspora NGO with the largest membership 
worldwide, has reportedly already transferred forty new homes 
and a new elementary school in the N-K village of Norashen to 
the N-K authorities with plans to expand the program to 
include eight more villages around Stepanakert in the 
upcoming year.  AGBU sources told us October 18 that their 
recent Worldwide Congress (a bi-annual Board of Trustees 
meeting) produced so much excitement for the project that 
local chapters in Europe and South America have removed 
themselves from the AGBU\'s central financing in order to 
dedicate more resources (upwards of USD 5 million per country 
in some cases) to the project.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
PROJECT TO MAKE N-K A \"MORE ATTRACTIVE PERMANENT ADDRESS\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2. (SBU) The Armenian General Benevolent Union is increasing 
its efforts to support ongoing Armenian government-sponsored 
repopulation programs in Nagorno-Karabakh through its 
\"Centennial Project.\"  The project includes a large-scale 
rebuilding program (single-family homes, schools and 
community centers) in villages surrounding Stepanakert.  The 
project is being coordinated closely with local N-K 
authorities and GOAM representatives as part of the ongoing 
incentive program to attract Armenians to re-settle portions 
of Nagorno-Karbakh.  According to AGBU sources, the initial 
villages are part of a list of \"artificially Azeri-populated\" 
areas within N-K with relatively small populations. 
According to the AGBU, some within the N-K leadership view 
these villages as \"liabilities\" in proving their case that 
N-K is a wholly Armenian territory.  While the Embassy cannot 
confirm the reports, GOAM and AGBU sources claim that there 
are no plans to fund re-building projects in the occupied 
territories outside of N-K.  The Centennial Project chose the 
village of Norashen (east of Stepanakert) as the pilot site 
for the re-building program.  The next phase of the project 
will include building programs in the Hadrut and Martakert 
regions of N-K. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
ENTHUSIASTIC BOARD CHIPS IN LOCAL OPERATING BUDGETS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3. (C) AGBU sources told us October 18 that their recent 
worldwide Congress (a bi-annual Board of Trustees meeting 
held this year in Yerevan and N-K) produced considerable 
excitement for the project.  N-K \"President\" Arkady Ghukasian 
praised the initiative during his keynote address to over 300 
AGBU conference participants during a widely-publicized 
inaugural event in Yerevan.  Local chapters in Europe and 
South America, upon seeing the initial results of the 
project, offered to remove themselves from the AGBU\'s central 
financing for the upcoming year in order to dedicate their 
operating budgets to the Centennial Project.  This 
contribution could mean a USD 5 million increase in the cases 
of larger chapters in Brazil, France and the United Kingdom. 
French-Armenian Leon Kabandjian conceived the project in 2002 
as a way to systematically mobilize support for N-K in the 
wake of \"dying interest\" on the part of Diaspora Groups.  His 
efforts in France garnered sizable donations from AGBU donors 
in Paris and, according to rumors within the AGBU\'s ranks, 
spurred a funding race between chapters in France and 
England.  Donations from the London chapter will serve as the 
basis for the next tranche of Centennial Project funding. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4. (C) The excitement surrounding the Centennial Project is 
the first big news about Diaspora initiatives in N-K to 
circulate in Yerevan over the past year.  The news coincides 
with the new level of political interest in N-K resettlement 
issues resulting from ongoing discussions in at UNGA (ref). 
Perhaps more important than the AGBU\'s decision to move from 
traditional humanitarian response into infrastructure 
development is the accompanying discussion of re-invigorating 
Diaspora involvement in N-K.  We will be paying close 
attention to comments coming out of Yerevan and Stepanakert 
as the next phase of the Centennial Project gets underway.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Armenia plans to follow through with its commitment 
to deploy non-combat troops to Iraq.  The issue is a 
political hot potato, however, and the GOAM hopes the USG 
will help keep the issue out of public view while it works to 
obtain the parliamentary approval required for deployment. 
This was a key part of President Kocharian\'s message to EUR 
DAS Laura Kennedy during her October 14-17 visit to Armenia. 
In addition to covering a broad range of issues with top 
government, business, and civil society leaders, DAS Kennedy 
signed a new bilateral Article 98 agreement with FM Oskanian. 
 End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) DAS Laura Kennedy visited Yerevan from October 14-17 
and met with President Robert Kocharian, Foreign Minister 
Vartan Oskanian, Minister of Defense Serzh Sargsian, and 
National Assembly Speaker Artur Baghdasaryan.  She covered 
the full range of issues including GOAM support to the 
coalition in Iraq, efforts to open the border with Turkey, 
resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh impasse and the nature of 
USG assistance for Armenia.  President Kocharian and FM 
Oskanian complained bitterly about a move in the UN General 
Assembly by Azerbaijan to raise Nagorno-Karabakh outside the 
context of the Minsk Group negotiations.  (Details of the 
discussion on the UNGA discussion are covered in REF A.)  DAS 
Kennedy also attended the launch of a USAID-sponsored program 
supporting the development of new small and medium sized 
businesses.  Press coverage of DAS Kennedy\'s visit was 
widespread, factual and generally very positive. 
 
TROOPS TO IRAQ: TOUGH POLITICAL SLEDDING AHEAD 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (C) DAS Kennedy congratulated the GOAM for its decision 
to deploy non-combat troops in Iraq, noted reports of 
domestic criticism, and asked if we could help in this 
regard.  Officials voiced their support for the move, but 
each expressed concern that it may be difficult to pass this 
decision through the National Assembly, Armenia\'s parliament. 
 They noted popular concern that this deployment could affect 
the security of ethnic Armenians residing in Iraq and 
elsewhere in the Middle East.  Defense Minister Sargsian told 
DAS Kennedy that he continued to support deploying Armenian 
troops in Iraq.  He was confident that the support of the 
MFA, MOD and the President should be enough to push the 
legislation through the National Assembly.  Speaker 
Baghdasaryan also expressed confidence in the passage.  He 
did not indicate specifically when the proposal would be 
dealt with, but indicated a general November timeframe. 
Sargsian requested the help of U.S. troops to protect 
Armenians in Iraq if they suffered from a backlash in 
response to this deployment. 
 
4.  (C) President Kocharian echoed Baghdasaryan in indicating 
that the government wanted to handle the planned deployment 
in as low-key a fashion as possible in order to get it 
through the National Assembly quickly and successfully.  He 
specifically requested that the USG assist the GOAM in 
keeping this issue out of the public eye. 
 
ARTICLE 98 AGREEMENT: SIGNED BUT PENDING RATIFICATION 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
5.  (C) DAS Kennedy signed a new Article 98 agreement with FM 
Oskanian in a quiet ceremony on Saturday, October 16.  (Note: 
The GOAM Constitutional Court declared the previous Article 
98 agreement -- the text of which referred to the Rome 
Statute -- unconstitutional until Armenia ratifies the 
Statute itself.  In a clear gesture of good will, the GOAM 
pushed a new text without reference to the Statute through 
its interagency process in short order (REF B). End Note.) 
Oskanian told DAS Kennedy that he expected the National 
Assembly to ratify the Article 98 agreement by the end of 
November.  The agreement must still, however, be certified by 
the Constitutional Court before it moves to the NA for 
ratification. 
 
Business and Civil Society: Some Progress, Much To Do 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6.  (C) At a luncheon with leaders of non-governmental 
organizations, DAS Kennedy pressed for closer engagement with 
the government; remaining outside the process simply means 
that dissenting voices will not be heard.  She pledged 
continued USG support for the development of Armenia\'s civil 
society.  Mikhael Daniliyan, chair of Armenia\'s Helsinki 
Association told DAS Kennedy that while there have been some 
improvements -- like the recent registration of Armenia\'s 
Jehovah\'s Witnesses -- much progress needs to be made to 
secure citizen\'s basic human rights.  Kennedy commended NGOs 
for pursuing regional ties and urged them to develop them 
further with Azerbaijan and Georgia. 
7.  (C) At a dinner with U.S. business leaders, DAS Kennedy 
heard a litany of complaints about the difficult business 
environment in Armenia, with corruption stressed by all. 
Byzantine, often contradictory legislation makes it tough to 
run a successful business in Armenia.  Sporadically enforced 
laws and predatory tax inspectors were challenges, but 
business leaders were nevertheless optimistic about prospects 
in this steadily-growing economy. 
 
ASSISTANCE: APPRECIATION ACROSS THE BOARD 
----------------------------------------- 
8.  (C) On October 15, DAS Kennedy attended a USAID-sponsored 
event where Ambassador Evans launched a \"road map\" for 
startup businesses in Armenia.  This project, in partnership 
with the Armenia\'s Ministry for Trade and Finance, is 
intended to help new businesses navigate the difficult waters 
of local legislation.  In each of DAS Kennedy\'s meetings, 
GOAM officials expressed gratitude for effective, carefully 
targeted, USG assistance.  President Kocharian, FM Oskanian 
and Defense Minister Sargsian all expressed embarrassment 
over their first attempt at a proposal for the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation (MCC) and acknowledged that their 
proposal was poorly focused.  Kocharian said he had ordered 
that it be redrafted immediately.  DAS Kennedy underscored 
the fact that there was still time to improve the proposal 
and that the MCC remained eager to engage Armenia on this 
issue. 
 
9.  (C) During her meeting with Defense Minister Sargsian, 
DAS Kennedy raised the issue of the Foreign Military 
Financing (FMF) projects.  Sargsian noted that he wished to 
spend FMF \"more effectively.\"  He brought up a recurring MOD 
request to use FMF funds exclusively for the purchase of 
military communications equipment.  Sargsian stated that this 
purchase would address one of the \"basic needs\" of the 
Armenian Military.  DAS Kennedy replied that the nature of 
FMF spending is up for discussion between Embassy Yerevan\'s 
Office of Defense Coordination (ODC) and the MOD and 
expressed concern over the focus of the pattern thus far. 
She welcomed the pending defense assessment as a major way to 
allow the USG and Armenia to more effectively address  MOD 
needs. 
 
10.  (U) DAS Kennedy has reviewed this telegram.

(U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The GOAM hopes to announce a solution to its 
refugee housing problem next year, but current plans 
depend on international donations that are unlikely to 
materialize.  Local implementers have concluded the 
government plan is unlikely to be financed because it 
does not address the housing needs of non-refugees. 
International agencies are pursuing alternative housing 
strategies.  By focusing too narrowly on refugee 
housing, the GOAM may miss a chance for international 
assistance.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
GOAM SETS HIGH GOAL FOR REFUGEE SOLUTION 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) According to the local UN Development Program 
(UNDP) coordinator, President Kocharian wants to 
announce a solution to Armenia\'s refugee housing 
problem during his speech to the UNGA in 2005.  He 
charged the Prime Minister and the cabinet with 
implementing a solution by that time.  The plan 
developed by the Department of Migration and Refugees 
(DMR) would house the 3,470 of the \"most vulnerable\" 
refugee families.  On June 1, the president declared 
the GOAM\'s acceptance of this plan, directed the 
Government to allocate five million dollars over the 
next three years for refugee housing, and authorized 
the Department of Migration and Refugees (DMR) to seek 
an additional thirteen million in funding from 
international donors (reftel).  According to Western 
NGOs, Armenia has approximately 80,000 refugees from 
its war with neighboring Azerbaijan. 
 
--------------------- 
PROPOSAL FALLING FLAT 
--------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The international community has not embraced 
the GOAM housing proposal for several reasons.  Because 
of IMF \"Midterm Expenditure Framework\" restrictions, 
the GOAM has been unable to allocate money for the 
program in the 2005 budget, and international 
implementers are unwilling to wait until 2006 for a 
coordinated strategy.  UN agencies advocated a 
comprehensive approach to house vulnerable families 
regardless of refugee status because they felt a 
comprehensive plan would link with economic development 
goals and more effectively attract World Bank funding. 
The GOAM, however, rejected this proposal in an attempt 
to give Kocharian a purely refugee solution by his 
stated deadline.  (Note:  While the GOAM proposal is 
ostensibly modeled on USAID\'s successful Earthquake 
Zone Recovery Program, the Armenian proposal lacks a 
strict system of financial accountability.  End Note.) 
DMR Head Gagik Yeghanian stated that he hopes the USG 
will fund a large share of the proposal.  Department 
representatives of the Bureau of Population, Migration, 
and Refugees informed Yeghanian in a meeting September 
23 that the USG could not fund any part of the 
proposal, but Yeghanian insisted he still believed the 
USG can find a way to significantly contribute. 
 
---------------------- 
ALTERNATIVE DIRECTIONS 
---------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) International organizations will continue 
their housing assistance programs in Armenia but will 
not coordinate them through DMR proposed refugee 
program.  UNDP plans to fund a USD 60,000 study of the 
housing needs in Armenia which it hopes will result in 
a housing program for non-refugee families funded 
through the World Bank.  The UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees will focus its efforts on rural areas, where 
housing costs are significantly less expensive than in 
the larger cities.  This year the agency will partner 
with the governor of the Syunik region who will 
contribute one-third of the housing costs.  Together 
they hope to house the 101 refugee families living in 
\"domik\" shipping containers or collective centers in 
that region.  And the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) 
has begun a program of refurbishing apartments and 
relocating refugees in Yerevan in conjunction with 
local landlords.  Armenian law does not allow landlords 
to evict refugees from privatized buildings unless the 
refugees are provided with alternative housing.  Under 
the NRC program, landlords give NRC between USD 20,000 
and 30,000 per building, NRC renovates another existing 
building for the refugees, they move to the renovated 
location, and every family receives the title to their 
apartment. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) The GOAM refugee housing plan will not die 
easily:  given political pressure, members of the 
Government appear to be unwilling to examine 
alternative solutions even though they might have a 
greater chance of success.  UNDP, with the concurrence 
of UNHCR and the NRC, states that it would still 
welcome GOAM participation in the creation of a broader 
housing strategy which would include refugees, but 
these agencies frankly do not expect such cooperation 
to be forthcoming.  By framing the problem too narrowly 
the GOAM may miss its best near-term chance to improve 
housing for refugees in Armenia.

BORDER OPEN AGAIN

2. (SBU) On Friday October 22, the Russian government 
reopened the border checkpoint Verkhniy Lars that had been 
closed September 15, following the Beslan School shootings 
in North Ossetia.  (Note:  Russian MFA confirmed the border 
opening.  End Note.)  The closure had put the squeeze of 
Armenian companies importing goods from Russia, raising 
transport costs by as much as 30 percent and stalling rows 
of cargo-laden trucks at the border.  The government of 
Armenia had raised the issues on many levels with the 
Russian government to no avail.

KOCHARIAN\'S CALL TO PUTIN -- COINCIDENCE?

3. (SBU) President Kocharian\'s official website claims that 
he initiated a call to Russia\'s President Putin the same day 
the border opened, October 22, to discuss the \"development 
and strengthening of Bilateral issues.\"  A source from the 
Russian MFA who was familiar with the Kocharian-Putin 
telephone conversation said that the October 22 opening was 
\"pure coincidence and should not be understood to have been 
brought about by Kocharian\'s call.\"  The coincidental nature 
of Kocharian\'s intervention was underscored by press reports 
which state that Russia has re-opened its land borders with 
Azerbaijan as well.

COMMENT

4. (SBU) The temporary closure of Russia\'s land border with 
Georgia was a strong reminder to Armenia of its dependence 
on transit through Georgia and Russia\'s northern Caucasus, 
underscoring Armenia\'s relatively weak bargaining power in 
the region.

SMALL RALLY, NO EXCITEMENT

2. (SBU) Roughly 1500 opposition supporters gathered 
October 26 in Opera Square for an authorized rally 
timed to coincide with commemorative events 
surrounding the anniversary of the October 27, 1999 
parliamentary murders.  Although rally organizers 
had significantly improved some of their logistical 
arrangements since their spring rallies (i.e., had a 
sound system that actually worked, had two dozen 
young supporters in matching T-shirts and banners 
all with the same \"no more terrorism\" message), they 
failed to generate any excitement in the crowd, 
which consisted largely of middle-aged men and a 
handful of sunflower seed vendors.

supporters marched from Opera Square to the National 
Assembly (located across the street from the U.S. 
Embassy) to lay a wreath and flowers in memory of 
the \"October 27\" victims.  Although the march was 
officially unauthorized, the police did not 
interfere and the march proceeded without incident. 
National Assembly Speaker Artur Baghdasarian and his 
Deputy Speakers met the senior members of the 
delegation at the gate and escorted about 30 
opposition leaders and victims\' family members to 
the memorial on the National Assembly grounds.  The 
remainder of the marchers placed their flowers along

The governing coalition\'s decision to have National

the opposition\'s wreath-laying (with wide television

cooperation.  With such minimal public support, the 
opposition may well follow through on some of its

boycott and get back into the process of reforming 
Armenia\'s constitution (on the National Assembly\'s 
agenda this winter).

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) In a strongly-worded diplomatic note 
addressed to the Embassy October 28, the Government 
of Armenia denied any illegal activity in the 
occupied territories and requested that the United 
States vote against the inclusion of the new agenda 
item proposed by Azerbaijan for inclusion in the 
59th General Assembly.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
TEXT OF GOAM DIPLOMATIC NOTE NO. 8/12007 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The English-language text of the diplomatic 
note follows.  Begin Text: 
 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of the Republic of Armenia 
 
No. 8/12007 
 
The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Armenia 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the 
United States of America and has the honor to refer 
to the new agenda item presented by the Republic of 
Azerbaijan for inclusion into the agenda of the 59th 
session of the UN General Assembly. 
 
The Ministry would kindly ask the Embassy to take 
into consideration the following.  The matter that 
is being raised by Azerbaijan is neither a matter of 
urgency, nor in fact a real issue.  Azerbaijan 
states that the four UN Security Council resolutions 
remain unimplemented.  Indeed, Armenia has done 
exactly as the resolutions state, and used its good 
offices to ameliorate the situation.  That is why in 
the face of Azerbaijan\'s continued refusal to talk 
to the leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia 
continues to negotiate with Azerbaijan. 
 
As for the existence of \'illegal activities\' in the 
territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, suffice it 
to say that each time Azerbaijan raises this issue 
in one or another international forum, Armenia 
responds by inviting any legitimate delegation to 
visit the region and see for themselves.  Azerbaijan 
consistently opposes international observers\' visits 
to the territories.  (An offer was made in April to 
the UN Office on Drug and Crime.  Another offer was 
made in June to UNESCO.  Both times, Armenians 
extended the invitation, and Azerbaijan blocked the 
effort.) 
 
Still, Azerbaijan continues to make unfounded 
allegations.  Their most recent effort involves the 
politically loaded term \'settlements\'.  This motion 
is a politically motivated effort to manipulate 
opinion, to create the kind of environment, which 
Azerbaijan believes will provide it with dividends 
both domestically and abroad.  Instead, what it will 
surely do is derail the peace process, which despite 
Azerbaijan\'s public outcries involves substantive 
explorations of prospects and possibilities. 
 
The focus of these negotiations is the issues of 
refugees, territories and the status of Nagorno- 
Karabakh.  The issue of territories continues to 
remain part of the package that is being negotiated. 
Until those negotiations are concluded, journalists, 
international aid workers, delegations from think 
tanks and academic and political institutions visit 
the region regularly, travel through those 
territories, and have never raised the issue of 
Armenian settlements there.  There are no Armenian 
settlements there. 
 
The most recent conflict resolution proposal which 
was produced as a result of talks between the 
presidents of the two countries itemizes in detail 
all the steps necessary for a final settlement: 
status of Nagorno-Karabakh, withdrawal timeline, 
demilitarized zones and return of refugees, 
peacekeepers.  In a word, every problematic subject 
is covered.  There is not a single word there on 
settlements.  Again, that is because there are no 
Armenian settlements there. 
 
Various European institutions have rapporteurs 
assigned to the region who are particularly 
interested in the conflict and regularly prepare 
reports on their visits.  The OSCE Chairman-in- 
Office Special Envoy on the Nagorno-Karabakh problem 
writes detailed monthly reports on the region.  He 
includes a wide array of information, including much 
that is not specifically within his mandate, but 
which is relevant to the conflict and its context. 
In none of those reports is there a single mention 
of settlements. 
 
This non-issue is being artificially raised by 
Azerbaijan to the level of urgent problem.  Armenia 
has 400,000 refugees of its own as a result of this 
15-year-old conflict.  There could not be such 
settlements or even a policy as the Armenians have 
intentionally refrained from encouraging such 
settlements.  Even though they may have provided 
some domestic dividends, they would clearly 
complicate the process of a lasting resolution. 
 
The Armenian side is ready to host any groups or 
observers who wish to come and personally see the 
situation on those lands for themselves.  It will be 
eminently clear that there is no \"new demographic 
situation\" there. 
 
The Government of Armenia would very much appreciate 
if the Government of the United States votes against 
the inclusion of this agenda item raised by 
Azerbaijan at the 59th session of the General 
Assembly to avert this attempt of Azerbaijan to 
further politicize the issue at this crucial time in 
the negotiation process. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Armenia avails itself of this opportunity to renew 
to the Embassy of the United States the assurances 
of its highest consideration.

COMMENT

4. (SBU) While we concur overall with the 
unhelpfulness of the proposed agenda item, we can in 
no way certify to the facts alleged in this 
diplomatic note, particularly not the assertion that 
there are 400,000 refugees in Armenia.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Minister of Justice David Harutunyan told the 
Ambassador on October 27 that the GOAM expected to make an 
announcement regarding a pending agreement with Armentel to 
bring a second mobile operator to Armenia and liberalize 
internet services within the next 10 days following months of 
international arbitration.  (Note:  A Greek firm bought 90 
percent of Armentel in 1998 and was granted a monopoly 
through 2013 on all telecommunications in the country and 
communications lines allowing access to the international 
market.  The GOAM has taken regulatory and legal action to 
deprive Armentel of its monopoly on all telecommunications 
because Armentel has failed to meet its investments 
commitments.  End Note.)  Harutunyan said the Ministry of 
Justice and others within the GOAM considered the expected 
terms of the deal to be \"favorable for Armenia\" without 
leaving Armenia susceptible to the \"dangers of uncontrolled 
liberalization.\"  Harutunian predicted that increased 
competition would provide better high-end service while 
Armentel would continue to provide basic services.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
ARMENTEL DEAL EXPECTED SOON 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Justice Minister Harutunyan told the Ambassador during 
an October 27 meeting that the GOAM expected to announce a 
settlement to ongoing international arbitration (reftel) 
within the next 10 days.  He said that the GOAM and Armentel 
had agreed \"in principle\" on a settlement package but that 
Armentel had requested a brief period before officially 
signing the deal and making the information public. 
Harutunyan expressed confidence that Armentel would sign the 
deal and shared his relief that arbitration -- which had 
become a major financial burden for the GOAM -- would finally 
come to an end.  He said that it was unlikely that the GOAM 
would be able to continue to finance arbitration were it to 
continue past the current set of negotiations. 
 
----------------------- 
\"FAVORABLE FOR ARMENIA\" 
----------------------- 
 
3. (C) Overall, Harutunyan said the expected terms of the 
deal were \"favorable for Armenia\" without leaving the country 
susceptible what he called the \"dangers of uncontrolled 
liberalization.\"  It was clear from his remarks that he was 
wary of opening the telecommunications market too quickly 
without the presence of proven service providers who could 
compensate for any holes left by an Armentel that was free to 
immediately exit unprofitable sectors. 
 
------------------------- 
IMPROVED HIGH-END SERVICE 
------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The deal, according to Harutunyan, would open the 
market to allow for direct satellite downloads, access to 
international list circuits and point-to-point connectivity. 
The minister noted that these reforms would greatly increase 
Armenia\'s access to the full range of internet services that 
would foster a more favorable business and encourage further 
investment in the country.  He claimed that a number of 
contentious issues (including satellite connectivity) were 
simply results of sloppy language or translation in the 
original agreement between Armentel and the GOAM which 
unintentionally gave Armentel undue freedom in its operations. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
COMMENT: MAKING SURE A BETTER DEAL MEANS BETTER SERVICE 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5. (C) While saying most of the right things in terms of 
market liberalization and open competition, Harutunyan\'s 
concern that Armenia could become even more of a 
telecommunications \"hostage\" to Armentel in the 
short-to-medium term says volumes about the complexity of the 
issue.  Assuming Harutunyan\'s optimism about the announcement 
is not overstated, the agreement might still be a tough sell 
for the GOAM to local critics who do not share Harutunyan\'s 
concern about the need for an incumbent operator to maintain 
operations during a transition period or who profit from the 
status quo.  Armenia\'s current level of telecommunications 
service -- woefully inadequate at best -- desperately needs a 
jolt from healthy competition.  We will continue to encourage 
all players in this issue to focus on the economic benefits 
of liberalization so that the temptations of short-term gains 
(by those with political/financial interests in the status 
quo) do not hijack what could be the beginning of better 
telecommunications service for Armenia.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Sources in Armenia\'s energy sector claim that, 
following the October 10 sabotage of transmission lines from 
Russia (Ref A), the Georgian government forced Armenia to 
sell electricity to Georgia below cost by threatening to 
raise transport tariffs on goods bound for Armenia.  Sources 
in the Government of Armenia told us the sale was \"not 
unusual\" and have denied allegations that Georgia threatened 
to raise tariffs if it did not receive cheap electricity. 
Whatever the story behind the deal, the concessionary sale 
to Georgia costs the Armenian energy sector USD 300,000 per 
month, and illustrates a current feeling of vulnerability to 
transport through Georgia exacerbated by the recent closing 
of the Russia Georgia border (Refs C, D).  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
ARMENIA EXPORTS POWER TO GEORGIA ON THE CHEAP 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenia has started exporting electricity (60MW) to 
Georgia below the cost of production, in effect subsidizing 
Georgia\'s electricity market.  Following the October 10 
sabotage of transmission lines from Russia, ArmRosGazProm 
and United Distribution Company of Georgia entered into an 
agreement that Armenia will export electricity to Georgia at 
last year\'s rate of 2.5 U.S. cents kW/h through the end of 
March 2005, with a price adjustment mechanism if the gas 
price rises before that time.  According to Armenian law, 
only the highest marginal cost electricity may be used for 
export.  Based on current operations, the highest cost 
generation plant is Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant, which is 
operating at about 50 percent capacity.  Its tariff for 
Armenian consumers is 15.22 ADM (about 3.05 U.S. cents) per 
kW/h.  According to technical advisors to the Public 
Services Regulatory Commission (PRSC), which set the price 
in this case, the difference between the actual cost of 
generation and transmission and the 2.5 U.S. cents per kW/h 
tariff for 60 MW could be as high as USD 300,000 per month. 
Armenian consumers will bear the cost in the form of higher 
electricity tariffs. 
 
------------------- 
POWER AND INFLUENCE 
------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) PA Consulting, which serves as the technical 
advisor to the Ministry of Energy and the PRSC in Armenia 
and is also the buyer of the electricity in Georgia, told us 
that Georgia\'s Prime Minister called on the Government of 
Armenia to use Armenia\'s excess generation capacity to meet 
Georgia\'s unmet demand.  Sources disagree about whether 
Georgia threatened to raise the transit tariffs of Armenia- 
bound goods through Georgian territory by 20 percent if 
Armenia refused to deliver the electricity at last year\'s 
rates.  (Note:  More than 90 percent of Armenia\'s non- 
diamond trade transits Georgia.  End Note.)  In any case, 
there was doubtless uncertainty about what price to charge 
Georgia.  Before the dissolution of ArmEnergo October 1, the 
GOAM itself would have made the export through the state- 
owned single buyer of electricity (Ref B).  With ArmEnergo 
out of the picture, Armenia\'s PRSC lacks market rules on 
which to rely when setting price rules for foreign 
governments or, for that matter, the private distributor. 
Although the private distributor, Electricity Networks of 
Armenia (ElNetArm), inherited ArmEnergo\'s export contracts, 
the government effected the export through the state- 
controlled ArmRosGazProm (55 percent Russian and 45 percent 
Armenian owned). 
 
---------------------------- 
COMMENT:  CAUCASIAN HOSTAGE? 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) While stories conflict about whether there were any 
threats from Georgia, no one disputes that Armenia is 
exporting electricity to Georgia at a rate less than 
marginal cost.  If Georgia is seeking to profit from the 
perception of vulnerability and isolation in Armenia, its 
timing could not be better.  The recent temporary, month- 
long closure of the Verkhniy-Lars border crossing between 
Russia and Georgia stranded hundreds of trucks bound for 
Armenia and diverted trade through the Georgian ports of 
Poti and Batumi at extra cost.  Although Russia opened the 
border October 22 (Ref D), a recent visit by the Russian 
Minister of Transport did little but highlight the 
implausibility of alternative routes for Russian goods, 
including via the Caspian Sea and through Iran.  As the 
transport of goods through Georgia faces more expense and 
obstacles, the GOAM is not likely to forget that more than 
half of the electricity that Armenia generates depends on 
gas that flows through from Russia through Georgia.  While 
Armenia\'s Ministry of Trade has long pushed to reduce 
Georgia\'s transit tariffs on goods bound for Armenia, recent 
events remind the GOAM that Armenia\'s bargaining position is 
weak.

WINNING THE GAME OF INCHES

protect accordingly. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenia\'s 2004 economic performance should 
lend confidence to investors and development economists 
alike.  Armenia\'s oft-cited problems maintaining a 
transparent and fair business climate notwithstanding, 
the economy continues to grow, driven largely by 
private investment across several sectors.  All 
indicators suggest a stable macroeconomic environment 
and steady (but slow) progress reducing poverty.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW: GROWTH REMAINS STRONG 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) GDP growth remained strong at 9.7 percent 
during the first three quarters of 2004, vice 14.8 
percent for the same period last year.  The 
government\'s estimate of a year-end growth rate of 8 
percent is likely to be right:  growth in the fourth 
quarter is typically slower than the year average.  By 
sector, growth was strongest in construction, retail 
trade and agriculture.  A decline in the diamond 
polishing industry due to reduced imports of raw 
diamonds from Russia accounts for a fall in industrial 
growth to 2.8 percent from 27 percent last year as well 
as a similar fall in Armenia\'s export and import 
numbers.  Non-diamond industrial growth was 9 percent, 
in line with overall growth in GDP. 
 
----------------------------- 
PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION THRIVING 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) As in 2002 and 2003, construction is one of 
the key growth sectors.  The continuing growth in the 
construction industry has proven wrong the popular 
assertion that last year\'s construction boom depended 
wholly on the Lincy Foundation\'s humanitarian financing 
of USD 115 million of improvements in 2002 and 2003. 
Construction is up 18 percent on last year\'s level, 
which includes the Lincy Foundation\'s contributions, 
and 60 percent of all construction is privately 
financed.  In addition to providing a good source of 
employment to unskilled workers, Yerevan\'s ongoing 
construction boom (largely housing) bears witness to 
the rising level of local investor confidence. 
 
----------------------------------- 
INFLATION AND EXCHANGE RATES STEADY 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Despite concerns about inflation earlier in 
the year, the government is likely to meet its three 
percent inflation target.  In August 2004 the Central 
Bank allowed the dram to appreciate against foreign 
currencies making many imports cheaper.  Controlled 
annual inflation and the relative stability of 
Armenia\'s currency create a stable environment for 
business.  The dram\'s sudden adjustment against the 
dollar this year appears to be sticking:  we do not 
expect volatility in the currency market. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
CASH POVERTY PERSISTS DESPITE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
6. (SBU) Despite several years of high growth, 
commensurate improvements in poverty levels have been 
less evident.  In October the GOAM statistics service 
announced the first significant drop in the poverty 
rate in several years, to 42.9 percent from 49.7 
percent of the population.  Although the official 
poverty line (about USD 24 per month) is probably too 
low to reflect the cost of living, lower-income 
Armenians are \"cash poor.\"  People generally have 
shelter and clothing and even old luxury items like a 
television, but they lack income beyond meager pensions 
or cash remittances from relatives living abroad.  In 
rural areas there are more serious poverty issues 
related to access to water and electricity. 
 
------------------------------------ 
LOWER INTEREST RATES A POSITIVE SIGN 
------------------------------------ 
7. (SBU) No sign is more important to Armenia\'s 
investors than the steady fall in lending and deposit 
rates in the banking sector.  Government treasury bond 
yields have fallen to under 7 percent, illustrating a 
perception of lower country risk and allowing 
commercial banks to attract deposits more cheaply. 
Although bank lending rates remain prohibitively high 
at 18 percent, the sharp fall in deposit rates from 18 
percent in 2001 to 4.8 percent today suggests that 
banks will be able to lend money more cheaply in the 
future.  Armenia\'s banking sector is still a woefully 
inadequate source of capital and people depend on 
friends and family to finance investments. 
Nevertheless, government measures designed to 
strengthen the banking sector have done so and interest 
rates are market-determined. 
 
----------------------------------- 
COMMENT: WINNING THE GAME OF INCHES 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) While Armenia\'s critics rightly disparage what 
appears to be worsening corruption and further 
consolidation of wealth into the hands of a few 
oligarchs, statistics continue to suggest that Armenia 
is winning the game of inches.  As Armenia\'s economy 
continues on its path of strong growth, the overall 
macroeconomic environment remains stable and there are 
noticeable positive effects on poverty.  The government 
has had small success in raising its tax revenues by 18 
percent, which should help it meets its targets to 
reduce poverty among those populations that depend on 
government salaries and pensions.  The constantly 
improving situation explains the public\'s general 
acquiescence to Armenia\'s oligopolistic economy:  the 
course of Armenia\'s development and the distribution of 
its wealth may not be fair, but inch by inch the 
situation is improving for most people.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenia faces severe and continuing deforestation. 
Although the law prohibits commercial cutting, corruption 
and inefficacy in Hayantar, the state forestry agency, 
result in the continued illegal clear-cutting of Armenia\'s 
forests.  While some cutting may be ascribed to allowable 
personal uses, a sizable percentage of deforestation, 
especially of valuable hardwoods, is attributable to corrupt 
deals between Hayantar, commercial interests and regional 
law enforcement.  In addressing environmental challenges as 
in other areas, the Government of Armenia has not 
demonstrated the necessary political will or the ability to 
enforce the law and pursue its stated public policy.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
ARMENIA\'S SHRINKING FORESTS 
--------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Armenia\'s tree cover has shrunk significantly in 
the last century, and deforestation rates have accelerated 
since independence.  According to NGOs and the GOAM, less 
than nine percent of Armenia is currently forested, twenty 
percent less than at the time of independence.  Because 
intensive cutting is not accompanied by replanting, and 
because the older trees (which bear the most seeds) are also 
the most attractive sources of wood, forests are being 
logged beyond the point of sustainability.  Clear-cutting 
has accelerated soil erosion, making it difficult to 
successfully cultivate anything, including new trees.  At 
its most extreme, erosion has caused mudslides to bury homes 
and roads in villages near deforested slopes. 
 
---------------------------- 
POVERTY STILL TAKES ITS TOLL 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The large-scale deforestation of the early 1990s is 
attributable to the energy crisis that forced many Armenians 
to burn any available fuel; stands of trees inside and near 
cities suffered particularly.  According to the World Bank, 
Hayantar, and NGO sources, some cutting is still 
attributable to Armenians who are either unable or unwilling 
to pay for electrical or gas fuel, or live in areas not 
served by these utilities. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
BUT ILLEGAL COMMERCIAL CUTTING LOOMS LARGER 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Illegal commercial cutting is currently more 
damaging to Armenia\'s forests than cutting for personal 
uses.  Poor enforcement and corruption in Hayantar 
contribute to unsustainable commercial cutting of large 
areas of forest.  Hayantar\'s director admitted to us that 
there is corruption in his ranks:  recently Hayantar fired 
two employees for sanctioning illegal cutting in exchange 
for kickbacks.  Hayantar has authority to issue licenses 
only for sanitary cutting -- the removal of fallen trees and 
the preemptive cutting and removal of sick trees that will 
soon fall naturally.  In fact, sanitary cutting licenses 
operate as cartes blanches to clear entire stands of healthy 
forest.  A local brandy company told us that its agreement 
with Hayantar limited only the total amount that it cut to 
make its barrels, and that Hayantar had no effective method 
of tracking of this amount. 
 
---------------------------- 
NASCENT PRO-FORESTRY EFFORTS 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Investigative journalists and NGOs have been 
raising public awareness about the cutting of Armenia\'s 
forests.  After NGO workers videotaped illegally cut stands, 
Hayantar fired local officials who had permitted the 
logging.  President Kocharian made strong public statements 
condemning commercial cutting, and changed the management of 
Hayantar.  New customs regulations require a permit from 
Hayantar to export wood:  total exports should be limited to 
the total amount of allowed sanitary cutting.  Nonetheless, 
Armenia, a deforested country that bans commercial cutting, 
continues to be a net exporter of lumber despite double- 
digit growth in the domestic construction sector. 
 
---------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  CORRUPTION TRUMPS POLICY 
---------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) In tackling deforestation the government has 
reached the point where it must decide if it is willing to 
challenge profitable enterprises owned by well-connected 
oligarchs.  (Note:  The main exporter of lumber, Harutyun 
Pambukyan, is one of Armenia\'s richest men and a Deputy of 
Parliament.  End Note.)  The trickle-up corruption of 
forbidding logging but sanctioning it in exchange for bribes 
benefits Armenia\'s major players more than would the 
legalization of commercial logging.

KOCHARIAN SACKS NSS CHIEF 
------------------------- 
 
1. (C) President Robert Kocharian fired his Minister of the 
National Security Service (NSS) Karlos Petrossian November 5. 
 Although there have been frequent rumors about Petrossian\'s 
departure, the immediate cause for his fall from grace 
appears to be the most recent report of Petrossian\'s 
corruption that reached the President\'s desk. 
 
----------------------------- 
TOO MANY COMPLAINTS TO IGNORE 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (S) GOAM lawyer Vahe Yacoubian (a U.S. citizen) who said 
he and the Minister of Justice David Harutunyan were with the 
President when he made the call to fire Petrossian, told us 
that \"Karlos just went over the line once too often.\"  The 
most recent incident involved a high-end car stolen in Greece 
that Interpol located in Yerevan, the police confiscated and 
that then disappeared from police custody only to turn up in 
a shipment of cars bound for Russia at the Georgian border. 
According to Yacoubian, complaints about Petrossian\'s alleged 
involvement reached President Kocharian separately from the 
local Interpol office, the Greek insurance company that had 
filed the initial reports, and Armenian Revolutionary Faction 
(ARF) Dashnaks (part of the governing coalition) who had been 
contacted by the car\'s owner in Greece.  The complaint from 
the Dashnaks was \"the straw that broke the camel\'s back,\" 
according to Yacoubian:  Kocharian simply could not afford to 
let Petrossian continue to alienate the politically crucial 
Dashnaks. 
 
----------------------- 
NO PRE-CHOSEN SUCCESSOR 
----------------------- 
 
3. (C) Because Petrossian\'s departure had not been scheduled, 
no successor was immediately apparent.  Press reports and 
ministerial contacts speculate that NSS Deputy Minister 
Feliks Tsolakyan, Presidential National Security Advisor 
Garnik Isagulyan and former Kashatagh Marzpet Aleksan 
Hakobyan are the leading candidates to replace Petrossian.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) A shortage of aviation fuel is forcing Armenia\'s 
outbound flights to make intermediate landings to refuel 
before continuing on their scheduled itinerary.  Although 
government and aviation authorities claim the problem has 
been solved and expect a shipment soon, the Directorate of 
Civil Aviation told us that they have nevertheless 
instructed airlines to take care of their own fuel needs 
(from other airports) until the situation stabilizes.  GOAM 
officials allege that actions of Azerbaijan have caused the 
shortages.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
ARMENIAN FLIGHTS FORCED TO FUEL ELSEWHERE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Armenia\'s main carrier Armavia has borne the brunt of 
Armenia\'s shortage of aviation fuel over the last three 
weeks.  Their twice-daily service to Moscow, a two-and-one- 
half hour flight, requires a stopover in the southern 
Russian city of Sochi to refuel.  Insufficient supply has 
driven prices at Yerevan\'s Zvartnots Airport from USD 380 
per ton to USD 680 per ton, forcing European airlines like 
Austrian Air to carry fuel for their return trip with them 
to Yerevan. 
 
-------------- 
AZERI EMBARGO? 
-------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Deputy Minister of Trade Tigran Davtyan confirmed 
reports in the press that shipments of aviation fuel to 
Armenia have been limited by authorities in Georgia under 
pressure from Azerbaijan.  Armenia\'s aviation fuel comes 
from Turkmenistan via both Georgia and Azerbaijan.  Davtyan 
said that President Kocharian discussed the issue with 
Georgian President Saakashvili along with other transport 
concerns \"in the context of Georgia\'s WTO obligations to 
Armenia.\" He said that Georgia had promised to solve the 
problem.  Head of Air Traffic Control Elmira Minasyan at 
Zvartnots International Airport confirmed that the airport 
is expecting to receive replenished supplies November 5 and 
does not expect a problem in the future. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
COMMENT:  ANOTHER SIGN OF ARMENIA\'S VULNERABILITY 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5. (SBU) Unsettled by the recent border closure between 
Russia and Georgia (ref A), possible pressure to deliver 
cheap electricity to Georgia (ref B), and now the shortage 
of aviation fuel, the geographic and political isolation of 
Armenia remains strongly in evidence.  As Deputy Minister 
Davtyan pointed out, alternate trade routes through Iran are 
undeveloped and inconvenient, leaving Armenia vulnerable to 
disruptions in trade through Georgian territory.  We are not 
able to verify Davtyan\'s claim that the Government of 
Azerbaijan is behind this interruption in supply.

NSS HAS NOT COMPLETED ITS INVESTIGATION, NO NEWS AVAILABLE 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
1. (C) As reported in ref A, Ashot Martirosyan, Head of the 
Armenian Nuclear Regulatory Agency (ANRA), verified on 
October 19 that approximately two curies of radioactive 
cesium-137 was seized from an Armenian citizen Gagik 
Tovmasyan on October 15. 
 
2. (C) On November 5, we met again with Martirosyan and 
underscored the USG\'s intense interest in this issue (ref B). 
 Martirosyan told us that the Armenian National Security 
Service (NSS) was still leading the investigation and stated 
they could not share any information with ANRA until they 
finished their investigation.  The NSS did tell Martirosyan 
that the source\'s radiation strength was measured at 
approximately one half roentgen.  Martirosyan explained that 
this was considered a high level of radiation, and out of the 
approximately 80 registered sources of cesium 137 in Armenia, 
none matched this source strength.  Martirosyan could not 
discount the possibility that this source had escaped ANRA\'s 
registration.  Martirosyan believed, however, that the source 
probably came from outside of Armenia, most likely from 
Russia.  Martirosyan would not speculate as to why Tovmasyan 
may have brought the cesium to Armenia and to whom he wanted 
to sell it.  The NSS reportedly told Martirosyan that 
Tovmasyan refused to admit where he had obtained the cesium. 
 
3. (C) Martirosyan did not believe political factors would 
impede the investigation and pointed out that the NSS almost 
immediately reported the seizure of the cesium to the 
Armenian mass media.  Martirosyan told us that under Armenian 
law, it is illegal to own or transport radioactive materials 
without a license.  He believed that the maximum prison 
sentence was about 5 years.  Martirorsyan stated that to his 
knowledge, no one had been convicted of this crime previously 
in Armenia.

could vote for the Turkmenistan resolution if it

current N-K resolution, Armenia might modify its vote 
on Zimbabwe.

5. (SBU) Although Armenia recognizes Iran\'s human 
rights abuses, Apitonian stated that Armenia could not 
vote for the resolution on Iran and would likely 
abstain.  He continued to note that concern for the 
welfare of the large ethnic Armenian population in Iran 
and the importance of trade relations prevent Armenia 
from taking a stronger stance.

continue to develop its cooperation with the Alliance, 
introduced NATO\'s new special representative to the region 
and explained that NATO is not in competition with any other 
organization and does not seek to diminish the Russian

current state of negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) On November 5, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop 
Scheffer visited Armenia for six hours.  The SYG met with 
with President Kocharian, Foreign Minister Oskanian and 
Defense Minister Sargsian and addressed a group of students 
at Yerevan State University.  Press coverage of the SYG\'s 
visit was factual and generally positive. 
 
NATO \"Not in Competition with Russia\" 
------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) In a briefing to NATO Ambassadors accredited in 
Armenia, the SYG said that in all of his meetings and in his 
public remarks, he urged closer cooperation with NATO while 
at the same time underscored that NATO is not in competition 
with any other organization or country for influence in the 
South Caucasus.  The SYG introduced Robert Simmons as his new 
Special Representative for the South Caucasus and Central 
Asia. 
 
Armenia\'s IPAP Won\'t Be Ready for EAPC Ministerial 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4.  (SBU) The SYG said that President Kocharian declared his 
commitment to complete its draft of Armenia\'s Individual 
Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) quickly.  Kocharian asked for 
NATO\'s guidance in defining priorities for the plan, but the 
SYG demurred; it was up to Armenia to define its goals for 
its relationship with the Alliance, not the other way around. 
 While the GOAM said it was taking the IPAP process 
seriously, the SYG said it did not seem to understand the 
complexity of the task.  The SYG urged Armenia to consult 
with NATO International Staff experts through the Planning 
and Review Process.  Special Rep Simmons said that while 
Armenia hoped to present its IPAP in time for the December 9 
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Commission (EAPC) ministerial, this 
goal was unrealistic.  Azerbaijan is further along, Simmons 
added, and would likely complete this process in time for the 
December Ministerial. 
 
Outlook \"Gloomy\" on N-K 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) The SYG said that Kocharian briefed him on the 
current state of play in negotiations on N-K and gave a 
\"gloomy analysis\" of prospects for the near term.  Kocharian 
claimed that in light of Azerbaijan\'s actions at the UNGA, he 
could no longer represent N-K.  Kocharian characterized his 
September meeting in Astana with President Aliyev as 
productive, but regretted that follow-on now seemed unlikely. 
 The SYG told NATO Ambassadors that President Aliyev had 
described the Astana meeting as having \"not much content and 
no follow-up\" in a meeting earlier in the day in Baku.

Karabakh-Telecom, the \"winner\" of a midnight tender.  While 
the public has supported renegotiating Armentel\'s monopoly, 
critics have cried foul at the lack of transparency in 
granting the second license.  Representatives of the Ministry 
of Justice told us that the choice of Karabakh-Telecom was 
political -- presumably designed to protect Karabakh\'s 
embattled telecom company and preclude Russian control over 
yet another of Armenia\'s sectors.  Competition in the mobile 
market will be a good thing even if achieved improperly, but 
we expected a better deal with Armentel and a better process 
in awarding a new license.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
DONE DEAL:  DID ARMENIA GET WHAT IT WANTED? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Ending a years-long dispute with Armentel and its 
parent corporation, OTE (Hellenic Telecommunications) of 
Greece, Armenia tightened Armentel\'s monopoly rights over 
international calls to include voice-over-internet protocol 
(VoIP) in exchange for adding a competing mobile licensee. 
This deal also formalized the de facto status quo in 
international data transmissions:  Armentel keeps the 
monopoly on uploads, downloads stay unrestricted.  Despite 
the GOAM\'s weak legal position before the London arbitration, 
we expected a better deal.  Any deal had to include a second 
mobile operator, but the GOAM\'s concession over VoIP is 
surprising.  Armenia currently has 240 VoIP operators, 
providing international calls at rates more than ten times 
cheaper than Armentel\'s.  Presumably Armentel will use its 
monopoly in VoIP to try to end the service altogether.  The 
cost to consumers and businesses for closing Armenia\'s VoIP 
could outweigh the gains by adding competition in mobile 
communications. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
BACKGROUND:  GOAM SPENT A LOT OF TIME, MONEY, TO GET HERE 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
3. (C) Armenia\'s telecommunications infrastructure has long 
been woefully inadequate:  connections are poor, villages are 
without service, and new mobile accounts are unavailable 
except on the black market.  Armentel, which had a monopoly 
on all telecommunications in Armenia until 2013, has failed 
to live up to its investment commitments and been unable to 
earn enough in lucrative sectors like mobile and 
international service to justify continued large investment 
in the unprofitable fixed line system.  Following disputes 
about Armentel\'s investment level, the GOAM took legal and 
regulatory actions -- some meritorious, others not -- to 
restrict the monopoly license and allow a competitor in 
cellular telephony and international data transmission. 
Armentel\'s parent company, OTE, pledged that it would invest 
no new money to upgrade Armenia\'s telecommunications 
infrastructure while its monopoly rights hung in balance.  By 
threatening to amend unilaterally Armentel\'s license, the 
GOAM successfully pushed Armentel to settle.  The Minister of 
Justice told the Ambassador that had they not reached an 
agreement this week, the GOAM could not afford to continue 
its legal processes in London arbitration (ref B). 
 
------------------------------------ 
CIRCLING THE WAGONS AROUND KARABAKH? 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (C) The day following the settlement with Armentel, the 
GOAM granted a second mobile license to Karabakh telecom, the 
mobile operator in Nagorno-Karabakh.  Karabakh Telecom had 
always been one of the contenders for the license:  it has 
3,500 mobile subscribers in nearby Karabakh but capacity for 
100,000.  But the government\'s point on the deal, Vahe 
Yacoubian, an Amcit lawyer for the GOAM and advisor to the 
Minister of Justice, previously told us that the tendering 
process would be open and transparent (ref A).  It was 
neither.  The tender took place in six hours in the middle of 
the night:  the details of the deal are still secret.  In a 
November 5 meeting with the Ambassador, Yacoubian 
acknowledged the unseemliness of the deal but said the deal 
was more political than corrupt.  Recently Karabakh telecom 
has been the subject of various efforts by Azerbaijan to 
isolate the company.  In May 2004, the Government of 
Azerbaijan lobbied foreign mobile companies to not cooperate 
with Karabakh Telecom or make roaming agreements.  Azerbaijan 
has also appealed to the International Telecommunication 
Union (ITU) and the GSM association to withdraw Karabakh 
Telecom\'s membership.  Granting the license to Karabakh 
Telecom would weaken Azerbaijan\'s argument that the company 
is operating illegally.  Now rather than operating 
exclusively within the disputed Karabakh region, Karabakh 
Telecom will operate in Armenia (a far bigger market) and 
also cover Karabakh, which shares Armenia\'s country code. 
November 10 news reports cited the Ministers of Justice and 
Transport and Communication claiming that the decision had 
been taken because Armenia \"could not leave Karabakh cut off 
from the world.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
COMMENT:  AN OPPORTUNITY SQUANDERED? 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Having gone through the trouble and expense to force a 
renegotiation of Armentel\'s contract, most here hoped for 
more.  The original deal with Armentel was a bad one for 
Armenia, but it was legal and the government of Armenia 
nevertheless took financial and reputation risks to force a 
renegotiation.  To settle the dispute the GOAM has 
surrendered additional, likely valuable, services to 
Armentel\'s monopoly, but it has not guaranteed a strong 
competitor on the Armenian market, and further it has failed 
to follow through with an international open tender that 
would have given the population and international investors 
confidence in the deal or the business environment.  All this 
may have been a high price to pay to protect 
Karabakh-Telecom, although politically the advantages to the 
government are clear -- the one thing on which politicians 
across the spectrum agree is that Karabakh must be protected. 
 While any competition in Armenia\'s beleaguered 
telecommunications sector will be welcome, Armenia has failed 
to make a positive step towards the ultimate liberalization 
of the market that would best serve consumers and tackle 
Armenia\'s capacity problems.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  In October 2004, Embassy\'s BISNIS representative 
visited the Tavush province of Armenia to explore 
investment and trade opportunities for U.S. companies 
and to expand U.S. - Armenian commercial ties.  He met 
with the province\'s business leaders and government 
officials.  This is another in a series of regional 
trips that reach out to local companies throughout the 
country to promote the BISNIS \"Search for Partners\" and 
\"Trades and Tenders\" programs and collect information 
on investment and commercial opportunities for U.S. 
companies.  Best prospects are listed in paragraphs 14- 
16 below.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
TAVUSH: GENERAL BACKGROUND 
-------------------------- 
 
2.  Tavush province is located in the North-Eastern 
part of Armenia.  The total area of the province is 969 
sq. miles.  According to the Tavush Governor\'s Office, 
the province\'s population is 134,000, including 49,000 
urban residents and 85,000 rural residents.  The 
province shares a border with Azerbaijan to the East 
and Georgia to the North. 
 
3.  The climate in Tavush is mild continental, with 
average maximum temperatures of 90 degrees Fahrenheit 
in summer and 50 degrees in winter, and minimum 
temperatures of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in summer and 23 
degrees in winter.  The region\'s altitude ranges from 
980 feet to 9,200 feet. 
 
4.  Tavush\'s mineral resources include a wide range of 
building materials including basalt, granite, 
quartzite, and marble, as well as bentonite, mineral 
paints, semiprecious stones, coal, dolomite and gyps. 
 
5.  Tavush\'s industrial potential is concentrated in 
the four largest cities, the capital Ijevan, Dilijan, 
Berd and Noyemberyan.  The province\'s large and medium- 
sized enterprises are involved mainly in building 
materials, woodworking, rug manufacturing and food 
processing industries.  All of the former Soviet 
factories in this region have been privatized.  The 
province\'s industrial production in 2003 totaled 
approximately USD 7 million, while agricultural 
production grossed USD 47 million. 
 
6.  Food processing is one of the fastest growing 
sectors of the province\'s economy.  Tavush has a long 
history of wine making.  The region\'s vineyards are 
located at an altitude of 2,300-3,900 feet.  The Ijevan 
Wine Factory was established in 1976 as a small 
processing enterprise and was converted into an open 
joint stock company in 1995.  The factory is equipped 
with modern grape processing and wine bottling lines 
imported from Germany.  The winery\'s products include 
several types of wines, including red dessert wine, 
semi-sweet wine, white table wine, red table wine, and 
rose table wine.  The company exports its products to 
the United States, Russia, and Japan.  The company 
received both financial and technical assistance from 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s Marketing 
Assistance Project Office in Yerevan. 
 
7.  The Bentonite Joint Stock Company was established 
in 1973 and privatized in 1996.  It specializes in the 
production of bentonite powder used for oil-well 
drilling, molding and rubber manufacturing.  Bentonite 
deposits are located very close to the plant. 
Bentonite JSC exports its products mainly to CIS 
countries.  Companies from Poland and Switzerland have 
expressed interest in purchasing Bentonite\'s products. 
Bentonite\'s new owner (the Moscow-based company Okro 
Okroyan) and management have ambitious plans to 
increase the company\'s exports as well as upgrade 
existing production and processing lines. 
 
8.  The province\'s leading industrial enterprise is the 
Ijevan Rug Factory, which was established in 1964 and 
privatized in 1995.  The factory produces a wide range 
of wool rugs.  During Soviet times it was one of the 
largest rug producers and exporters.  Since 1981 the 
factory has been the only exporter of wool rugs from 
the former Soviet Union to Arabic countries, China and 
Eastern Europe.  The factory is equipped with German 
made machines and is able to manufacture approximately 
13 million sq. feet of rugs annually.  Currently the 
factory does not utilize its full capacity.  Production 
and sales have been growing, however, since the local 
bank recently acquired a stake in the company. 
 
9.  Dilijan-MIGE JSC operates a mineral water bottling 
plant in the resort town of Dilijan.  The company is 
owned by Mikhail Bagdasarov, an Armenian-Russian 
businessman.  Most of the company\'s production is 
exported to CIS countries, the Middle East, and the 
U.S.  Currently, the company is upgrading the existing 
equipment to increase the plant\'s capacities. 
 
10.  Dilijan\'s Impulse plant was founded in 1967 
specializing in the production of communication 
equipment ordered by the Soviet Defense Ministry.  In 
1995 the plant was turned into a state-owned joint- 
stock company.  In 2002 it was privatized by Yerevan- 
based Radiotechnika LLC, the owner of several 
production plants as well as large trade centers 
throughout Armenia.  After a significant renovation of 
the plant\'s facilities it plans to establish a 
production of truck semi-trailers as well as an 
assembly line for consumer electronics. 
 
11.  Tourism is an attractive sector for investments in 
Tavush province.  The resort town of Dilijan is located 
in the mountainous part of the province near several 
old monasteries.  During Soviet times it was one of the 
most famous tourism centers in Armenia.  The city has 
numerous spas and health centers.  Recently Armenian- 
American businessman James Tufenkian initiated the 
Dilijan city center development program with an 
investment of more than USD 500,000.  The development 
program includes the construction of a 24-room hotel, 
restaurants, stores, and small studios and showrooms 
where Armenian art and crafts will be exhibited. 
 
12.  Tavush province is a transit point for road and 
rail traffic to and from Georgia.  The largest Armenian 
customs post is located at the village of Bagratashen 
on the Georgian border.  Near the village there is a 
popular wholesale open-air market for consumer goods 
and food products.  A large number of Armenian and 
Georgian small- and medium-sized vendors trade at this 
market where they can take advantage of a customs 
exemptions for the goods they personally carry across 
the border. 
 
13.  Most enterprises operating in Tavush have 
potential and need to establish long-term cooperation 
or a partnership with foreign investors.  The Embassy 
encourages interested U.S. firms to contact the 
Political-Economic Section of the Embassy or the BISNIS 
Trade Specialist for Armenia Ellen House by phone at: 
(202) 482-2284 or e-mail at Ellen_House@ita.doc.gov.

a joint stock company in 1997.  The company produces 
various sizes of wool rugs.  IRF imports raw materials 
mainly from Turkey and Russia.  The company seeks an 
established U.S. supplier of raw materials, including 
wool yarn, polyamide yarn, linen, and cotton yarn.  The 
projected annual demand for these products is 3,000 
tons.

total project cost is estimated at USD 500,000. 
 
16. (3) COMPANY: IJEVAN MECHANICAL PLANT 
 
Ijevan Mechanical Plant (IMP) was established in 1951. 
In 1995 in was privatized and turned into an open joint- 
stock company.  The plant specializes in the production 
of small-sized farming equipment, including 
cultivators, mowing-machines, and plows.  The company 
would like to become a distributor of a U.S. 
manufacturer of small- and medium-sized farming 
equipment.  IMP also seeks to establish a joint venture 
with an American company to begin production of 
equipment for farmers, including cultivators and 
mowers.

ON PENDING IRAQ DEPLOYMENT 
 
REF: YEREVAN 21666 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John M. Evans for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Recent statements by high-level policymakers and 
opinion pieces in the local media suggest that there may be 
growing opposition to the pending deployment of Armenian 
peacekeeping support to Iraq.  Reports of a car bomb 
explosion November 9 near an Armenian church in Iraq 
re-ignited a flurry of discussion in Armenia\'s capital and 
within the Armenian Diaspora community as to the potential 
dangers to Armenian communities in Iraq and the greater 
Middle East should Armenians join coalition forces in Iraq. 
In contrast to earlier criticism from smaller NGOs or 
marginalized political leaders in the opposition (reftel), 
recent remarks have come from the offices of the Prime 
Minister and the leadership of the governing coalition\'s 
Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF-\"Dashnaksutyun\") 
Party.  A member of the National Assembly (NA) told us 
recently that the GOAM has not consulted as deeply within the 
legislature as it should and that some within the NA are 
starting to waver on the issue.  Despite continued 
reassurances from the President, Foreign Minister and Defense 
Minister that the GOAM will stay its course (and the 
existence of enough ruling coalition votes in the legislature 
to pass such a measure notwithstanding), the road to a 
favorable vote in the National Assembly is likely to be less 
smooth than it was when Armenia first committed to deploy. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
PM, DASHNAKS LESS UPBEAT ABOUT IRAQ DEPLOYMENT 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (C) Recent statements by high-level policymakers and 
accompanying opinion pieces in the local media suggest that 
there may be growing opposition to the pending deployment of 
Armenian non-combat support troops to Iraq.  In contrast to 
earlier criticism from smaller NGOs and marginalized 
political leaders in the opposition (ref), recent remarks 
have come from serious political players in Armenia\'s 
capital.  Prime Minister Andranik Margaryan\'s late October 
comments to local media that \"we may or may not go ahead with 
the deployment\" was the first time that a high-ranking GOAM 
official had expressed doubt about the viability of sending 
Armenian support to coalition forces in Iraq.  A press 
conference following recent party meetings of the Armenian 
Revolutionary Federation (ARF-\"Dashnaksutyun\") included calls 
for caution, suggesting that an Armenian deployment could 
turn Armenian communities in the Middle East into targets for 
terrorist vendettas.  The local media latched onto both these 
statements while reiterating earlier comments by opposition 
leader Artashes Geghamian and local NGOs that criticized the 
GOAM\'s decision to deploy. 
 
---------------------------------- 
CAR BOMB IN IRAQ RE-IGNITES DEBATE 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) The November 9 explosion of a car bomb outside an 
Armenian Church in Iraq re-ignited local debate about the 
potential pros and cons of an Iraq deployment.  Both local 
and Diaspora-based media outlets were quick to point to the 
bombing as a possible warning to the GOAM by terrorist groups 
not to join coalition forces.  Local media published excerpts 
from open letters by Archbishop Avak Asadourian, 
representative of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Iraq, to 
President Robert Kocharian and Armenia\'s parliamentary 
leadership criticizing the decision to deploy Armenian 
troops, linking it to safety concerns for the estimated 
20,000 Armenians living in Iraq.  A local spokesman for the 
Armenian Apostolic Church, normally moderate in his approach 
to the subject, told us that there were growing concerns 
following that bombing that a deployment of Armenian forces 
could lead to similar attacks in the near future. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
DIASPORA PUSHES ON PARLIAMENT TO THINK TWICE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Recent meetings of international Diaspora groups have 
produced unofficial \"resolutions\" that the Diaspora should 
raise its concerns with contacts in the National Assembly.  A 
worldwide meeting of Armenian women in Geneva in late 
October, for example, resulted in telephone calls to MPs 
concerning the safety of Armenian communities in places like 
Syria, Lebanon and Egypt should the National Assembly ratify 
the decision to deploy forces.  A recent worldwide meeting of 
one Diaspora group reportedly included one-on-one 
\"consultations\" with GOAM leaders to \"see if they were really 
going to go through\" with the pledged deployment.  One MP 
told us recently that the GOAM has not consulted as deeply 
within the legislature as it should and that these statements 
are making some within the NA waver on the issue. 
 
------------------------------------ 
GOAM STILL STANDS FIRM, REASSURES US 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) The President, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister 
continue to reassure USG officials that enough political 
capital exists in the National Assembly to push through 
ratification of the deployment.  NA Speaker Baghdasaryan 
publicly responded to concerns in late October saying that 
the humanitarian nature of the planned deployment and 
continued USG assistance would help the vote pass without 
problem.  While the governing coalition technically has 
enough votes to ratify deployment (even given the ongoing 
opposition boycott), the recent statements by the Prime 
Minister and Dashnak leadership reveal potential fissures 
that could make the upcoming vote a more delicate initiative 
than it first appeared. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) We will continue to engage MPs and GOAM leadership 
privately on the importance of support for coalition forces 
but do not now plan on aggressive programs of Public 
Diplomacy to support deployment.  When DAS Kennedy met 
President Kocharian in October, he asked that we curb such 
efforts as they would \"likely be counterproductive.\"  End 
comment.

REF: YEREVAN 2470 
 
Classified By: DCM A.F. GODFREY FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) On November 19 the Armenian Government published the 
details of a second mobile license that it granted to 
Karabakh-Telecom during a six hour tender process during the 
night of November 4 (Reftel).  The government granted the 
license rights very cheaply, with no investment commitment 
inside Armenia, but, curiously, an investment commitment 
inside Nagorno-Karabakh.  The terms of the deal show that 
although the GOAM claimed it sought to end Armentel\'s 
monopoly in order to improve phone service in Armenia, they 
used the opportunity of a second license to subsidize 
telephone service in Nagorno-Karabakh.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
GOOD DEAL FOR K-TELECOM 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  According to information published on a GOAM 
website, Karabakh-Telecom, the Lebanese firm that was 
selected as Armenia\'s second mobile phone operator paid only 
USD 7 million for the license.  Of that seven million, it 
must pay USD 5 million to the GOAM over the next four years, 
and USD 2 million to the All-Armenian Hayastan Fund, a 
Diaspora-funded private charity whose mission is to build up 
Nagorno-Karabakh.  In a break with expectations and practice, 
the GOAM did not specify a minimum investment level for 
K-Telecom in Armenia, but did call for an additional USD 10 
million investment in Nagorno-Karabakh\'s telephone network, 
which it has run since 2001.  (Comment:  The investment 
commitment for mobile service in Armenia is likely 
unnecessary, as investment will be in the company\'s interest. 
 The commitment for Karabakh is necessary to compel K-Telecom 
to continue investment in its unprofitable fixed line service 
there.  End Comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
GOAM MADE DEAL TO PROTECT KARABAKH\'S TELEPHONE NETWORK 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3. (C) The Lebanese Ambassador to Armenia told the Ambassador 
November 16 that the owner of K-Telecom,  Pierre Fatouch was 
a personal friend.  Fatouch is a wealthy Christian Lebanese 
with no particular Armenian connection except that he is 
friendly with both President Kocharian and Defense Minister 
Sargsian.  According to the Lebanese Ambassador, Fatouch has 
lost upwards of fifteen million investing in Nagorno-Karabakh 
telecommunications and told the Armenians that he would have 
to pull out of Nagorno-Karabagh unless there was something 
for him in Armenia proper.  As noted in Reftel, Azerbaijan is 
pressuring international bodies regulating telecommunications 
and private telecom companies to exclude K-Telecom from 
roaming agreements.  The Lebanese Ambassador said that 
President Kocharian, Defense Minister Sargsian and the 
government of Armenia basically \"gave\" the license to 
Fatouch, expecting that he would bring down rates for 
Armenian users.  He has also been asked to look at water and 
electricity in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
ARMENIA\'S MOBILE USERS TO SUBSIDIZE KARABAKH PHONE SYSTEM 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
4. (C)  COMMENT:  Under the Armentel Monopoly, profitable 
mobile service subsidized unprofitable fixed line service in 
Armenia.  Now, a second mobile service in Armenia will 
subsidize unprofitable fixed line service in 
Nagorno-Karabakh.  The deal to end Armentel\'s monopoly was an 
opportunity to pursue the GOAM\'s stated goal of moving to a 
more liberalized telecommunications sector where relative 
prices  of fixed and mobile services would reflect relative 
costs and competition could be less restricted.  With this 
deal the GOAM scotched that opportunity and took a step 
backwards.  Because K-Telecom is counting on its profits in 
Armenia to compensate for losses in Karabakh, it is unlikely 
that the deal will bring down Armentel\'s high prices. 
Because Armentel is already oversubscribed, creating a black 
market for new SIM cards, K-Telecom can easily absorb excess 
demand without improving services or reducing prices.

OFF-BUDGET WAR CHEST?

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) During the summer and fall of 2004 the GOAM 
transferred two valuable state assets into the control of the 
Ministry of Defense or organizations it controls, keeping the 
revenues and their subsequent expenditure off the books.  In 
June the GOAM transferred 25 aircraft from the defunct 
Armenian Airlines to the Ministry of Defense, and an August 
decree allotted revenues from the Zangezour copper mine, 
Armenia\'s most profitable state asset, to the \"Motherland 
Military Patriotic Foundation\" which is reportedly directed 
by Armenia\'s top military brass.  The IMF has protested that 
revenues from the transfer of these assets do not appear on 
the state budgets and their subsequent expenditures are thus 
not subject to the review and scrutiny of the National 
Assembly.  Most analysts suspect that the government is 
keeping these transactions off-budget in order to obscure how 
much the GOAM spends defending Nagorno-Karabakh.  End 
Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
GOAM IS BANKING OFF-BUDGET REVENUES 
----------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) A published government decree from June 2004, approved 
by the Prime Minister and the President, has established a 
joint stock company with the assets of the bankrupt Armenian 
Airlines and assigned 100 percent of the shares to the 
Ministry of Defense.  The Ministry now owns Armenian 
Airlines\' old assets:  25 old Aeroflot planes, mostly old 
Tupolev passenger aircraft, and it is not clear if any deal 
will be made with the airline\'s creditors.  The government 
used a similar decree on August 18, 2004 to distribute 
revenues from Zangezour Copper Molybdenum Plant, Armenia\'s 
single most profitable asset to the \"Motherland Military 
Patriotic Fund.\"  (Note:  The Zangezour Copper Molybdenum 
Plant is one of Armenia\'s most valuable assets yet to 
privatized and one of the few state assets to make a profit. 
The copper mine was offered in a public tender early in 2004 
that attracted USD 132 million bids from an American firm and 
a German firm.  The Ministry of Trade has drawn out the sale 
and made the deal less likely, not least by insisting on 
selling both bidders 50 percent of the shares rather than 
awarding the tender to one bidder.  In a meeting with the 
Ambassador, the American entrepreneurs told us that they 
deposited USD 25 million in escrow to begin negotiations, but 
now must engage with the German firm to reach a shareholders\' 
agreement, as they have had little contact with their future 
business partners.  The bidders, who currently are also the 
mine\'s only client, claim that Zangezour is making more than 
USD 20 million per year.  End Note.) 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
MOTHERLAND: A MINISTRY OF DEFENSE SLUSH FUND 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) A press report quoted the Minister of Trade stating 
that Motherland is a public institution and that these funds 
would be used for state purposes.  The state register of 
foundations in the Ministry of Justice had little information 
about Motherland other than its August 16, 2004 date of 
registration (two days prior to the governmental decree) and 
its address, a building owned by the Ministry of Defense. 
Other usually-public information, notably the foundation\'s 
charter and the names of the founders, was absent.  Another 
organization, Martik, is a well-known fund controlled by the 
Ministry of Defense and is registered at the same address. 
Martik\'s board members include Minister of Defense Sargisyan, 
Deputy Minister Aghabekyan and various Armenian generals.  A 
representative from Martik told us that he knows nothing 
about the Motherland Military-Patriotic Foundation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
COMMENT: CORRUPTION OR SOURCE OF OFF-BUDGET FINANCING? 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4. (C) Both these cases illustrate a systematic policy of 
making off-budget transfers to the Ministry of Defense and 
foundations that it controls.  In addition to avoiding the 
scrutiny of the National Assembly and international observers 
over military spending, such a mechanism doubtless 
facilitates opportunities for graft among high-level 
officials.  The government\'s assignment of Zangezour,s 
profits suggests that the sale itself, equal to one-fifth of 
the official state budget, may also be kept off-budget. 
Indeed, there has been no discussion of how the GOAM intends 
to spend the USD 132 million in cash it expects to receive 
from the deal.  The IMF has unsuccessfully asked the Minister 
of Finance to record profits from the copper mine and from 
the future sale of Armenia Airlines, old aircraft (or, from 
the operation of the aircraft) as on-budget non-tax revenues. 
 While the government of Armenia is careful to maintain a 
facade of separation from the \"Government of 
Nagorno-Karabakh,\" analysts agree that these transactions are 
being kept off-budget in order to obscure how much Armenia 
spends on Nagorno-Karabakh\'s defense.

SUBJECT: ARMENIAN DEFMIN SOLID ON IRAQ CONTINGENT 
 
REF: YEREVAN 2494 
 
Classified By: Amb. John Evans, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.(S) Summary.  In a two-hour one-on-one with the 
Ambassador November 18, Armenian Defense Minister Serge 
Sargsian confirmed that he was rock solid in his commitment 
to fielding the Armenian non-combat contingent to Iraq. 
He volunteered that the issue was with the Constitutional 
Court and would soon move to the National Assembly, where 
he would personally present it for approval.  Other issues 
he touched on included domestic politics, Nagorno-Karabakh, 
concerns about Georgia and Turkey, and relations with 
Russia.  End Summary. 
 
2.(S)  Sargsian said Armenia simply had to 
participate in the International Coalition in Iraq for 
reasons of its own state interests.  Armenia opposed 
terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism and with Georgia and 
Azerbaijan participating, how could Armenia stand aloof? 
Sargsian said he would like to contribute a much larger 
contingent, but there were some very real constraints. 
First of all, there were not enough trained personnel. 
Second, Armenia was already on a \"war footing\" 
because of Karabagh.  And third, premium pay for the 
volunteers going to Iraq was five times what Armenian 
servicemen on the borders of their own country were 
receiving.  Sargsian noted that he had just returned from a 
National Assembly meeting at which he had argued for an 
increase in the defense budget occasioned by higher than 
expected fuel costs.   This was a particular problem in 
view of the new aircraft  e confirmed that he meant the 
Slovak SU-25s  rmenia was in the process of obtaining. 
 
3.(S)   Prompted by the Ambassador, Sargsian launched into 
a tour of the domestic political landscape.  Predictably, 
he had little positive to say about opposition leaders 
Demirchian and Geghamian and others.   He eased up in his 
overall disdain for the political class by according mild 
approbation to Artur Baghdasarian, the Parliamentary 
Speaker and leader of Orinats Yerkir, and Raffi Hovhanissian, 
the former U.S. citizen who was Amrenia  first foreign 
minister. 
 
4.(S)  On Nagorno-Karabagh, Sargsian said a settlement had 
to favor neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan; eventually, 
fifteen or twenty years down the road, things might 
look differently.  He claimed that, given a choice, 
seventy percent of Armenians would rather live with the 
Azeris than with the Georgians; on a personal level, 
they had a record of getting along.   Sargsian said the 
OSCE Minsk Process needed to be preserved at all costs. 
This was why the Azeri move in the UNGA  nd the Council 
of Europe Parliamentary Assembly  critical reports  ere so 
dangerous. 
 
5.  (S) The Ambassador expressed concern about the situation 
on the line of contact and asked about rules of engagement; 
press reports continue to describe sporadic incidents 
resulting from the close contact of Armenian and Azeri troops. 
Sargsian said a lieutenant (vzvod commander) was authorized 
to return fire, but then had immediately to report to his 
headquarters.  Of course not a meter of territory could be 
taken without express authorization.   Sargsian dismissed 
Azeri talk of war, saying that even if Azerbaijan built its 
forces up to twice what Armenia could field, it would not 
suffice; Baku would need a three- or four-fold advantage to 
have any confidence 
of victory. 
 
6.(S)  On Georgia, Sargsian said he worried about 
the impulsiveness of the young leaders who had come to 
power a year ago.  He said he had advised them not to bait 
the Russian bear.  He thought they had been unwise to try 
to duplicate their early success in Ajara in South Ossetia, 
but might now have learned their lesson. 
 
7.(S)  Asked about relations with Turkey, Sargsian was wary. 
He also admitted that there were some reasons to tolerate 
the current blockade of the border with Turkey.  While EU 
membership would be an undoubted plus for the region, one 
had to recall that Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 despite 
membership in NATO.   Sargsian said it would indeed be a 
shame if the Kars-Gyumri-Tbilisi rail link were replaced 
with an expensive new line that bypassed Armenian 
territory. 
 
8.(S)  As for relations with Russia, Sargsian said 
Russia was indeed Armenia  traditional ally, but lamented 
that  e have not solved all our own security problems 
yet. His own view, he said, was that when 
Russian-American relations were good, this was good for 
Armenia. 
 
9.(S)   Biographic note:  Sargsian told the 
Ambassador that he was acquainted with Vladimir Putin from 
the days when he was in charge of Armenia  National 
Security Service and Putin was heading the FSB in Moscow. 
There had been at least two group meetings of the 
intelligence chiefs in those years, and Sargsian said that 
at the one in St. Petersburg, Putin had been especially 
warm, giving him a big hug.   Putin had also offered to 
help investigate the 1999 parliamentary shootings, Sargisan 
said, although the Armenian side had declined the offer.

1. (C ) Over lunch November 23, Armenian National 
Assembly speaker Artur Baghdasarian shared with 
Ambassador the likely time-line for parliamentary 
consideration of the deployment of Armenia\'s non- 
combatant contingent to the Iraq Coalition and asked our 
assistance in mustering arguments to be deployed in the 
expected debate. 
 
2. (C ) The Speaker said the Constitutional Court was 
expected to transmit the case for action to the National 
Assembly on November 30.   He confirmed that 
technically, the issue before the Court and prospectively 
before the National Assembly would be the narrow one of 
the bilateral Armenian-Polish memorandum signed during 
President Kocharian\'s September visit to Warsaw.   He said 
the National Assembly was expected to take up the issue at 
its December 5-7 session. 
 
3.  C) In this connection, the Speaker noted that the 
National Assembly had been receiving so many inquiries 
about the proposed deployment that it had had to set up a 
hot line to deal with them.   Although the issue had 
purposely been narrowly defined, once it reached the 
National Assembly, the scope of the discussion would be 
difficult to control.  The Defense Minister would make the 
Government\'s case for the deployment, but the Speaker 
anticipated that he would bear the brunt of the hostile 
debate, which could come from the opposition or even from 
certain quarters within the parliamentary coalition.  He 
asked the Ambassador if he could provide whatever up-to- 
date supporting materials might be available. 
 
4.  ( C ) Action request:  Embassy requests guidance as to 
what materials, in addition to the excellent fact sheets 
available through State and CENTCOM websites, might 
best assist the Speaker (and the Defense Minister, who has 
not asked, but may) in making the case for the Armenian 
non-combatant deployment.   Facts and figures 
demonstrating what other comparable countries are 
contributing  specially neighboring Georgia and 
Azerbaijan, as well as Central Asian and East European 
states  ould serve this purpose best.   We do not expect 
anyone to generate new materials, but would appreciate any 
guidance as to what is the best material currently available.

1. (C) We met November 18 with Ashot Martirosyan, head of the 
Armenian Nuclear Regulatory Agency (ANRA) and underscored the 
USG\'s continued interest in this cesium-137 seizure case 
(refs A and B).  Martirosyan stated that he had still not 
received any substantive information from the Armenian 
National Security Service (NSS) about the seizure and/or why 
the Armenian national had the material.  NSS officials had 
only informed Martirosyan that the Armenian national in 
custody refused to say where he acquired the cesium. 
Martirosyan told us that he had not informed the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of this incident 
because he did not have even basic information about the 
radioactive source, or whether there was any contamination 
into the local environment.  Martirosyan told us that when he 
received this information he would report in full to the 
IAEA.  We pressed Martirosyan to ensure that Armenia 
fulfilled its reporting obligations. 
 
2. (C) Martirosyan told us that he reported the December 
2003, Government of Armenia (GOAM) seizure of a container of 
strontium-90 to the IAEA.  Martirosyan stated that there was 
a IAEA release from February 9, 2003, describing a level 2 
INES event out of Armenia, titled \"Unshielded Radioactive 
Source Found in Metal Scrap.\"  Martirosyan also showed us 
that the event was listed on the Nuclear Events Web-based 
system (NEWS).  Martirosyan stated that the GOAM had 
contacted Russian authorities concerning this container. 
Russian authorities could only confirm that the container was 
produced during the Soviet period and that the records 
pertaining to the container were lost and probably not 
retrievable.  Martirosyan was not optimistic that the origin 
of the strontium-90 container would be ever clear.

OSKANIAN COMMENTS ON AZERBAIJANI UN RESOLUTION 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
1.  During a joint press conference with visiting 
Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Margherita Boniver 
November 23, Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian 
commented that \"Azerbaijan is making a mistake by 
initiating the discussion of the situation in the 
occupied territories issue at the UN, and after a 
while, it will understand its mistake.\"  Oskanian 
continued, emphasizing that \"we are not concerned 
that the resolution might be adopted, we are more 
concerned at the further fate of the political 
process of settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh 
conflict.\" 
 
2.  Referring to a potential multinational fact- 
finding mission in the occupied territories, 
Oskanian pointed out that \"Armenian and Karabakh 
authorities are ready to render every assistance to 
the activities of such a mission.  However, the OSCE 
Minsk Group itself has a mandate to dispatch such a 
mission and in this case, the decision should not be 
adopted at the UN level.\" 
 
3.  Oskanian also said that the fate of the Prague 
process on the Karabakh settlement, begun this year, 
would depend on whether or not the Azerbaijani draft 
resolution \"On the situation on occupied Azerbaijani 
territories\" were adopted by the UN General 
Assembly.  Oskanian noted, however, that if the 
session of the UN General Assembly manages to pass 
another, compromise version of the resolution, 
Armenia could agree to continue negotiations on the 
basis of the Prague process.  \"Given this, we shall 
immediately be ready for the second phase of the 
negotiations,\" Oskanian said.

SUMMARY

2. (SBU) November 22 at 20:40 (local time) the car of 
Nikol Pashinyan, Editor-in-Chief of the opposition 
newspaper Haykakan Zhamanak, burst into flame in front 
of his office.  Pashinyan is convinced that a prominent 
businessman perpetrated the crime in retaliation for 
negative press coverage.  Haykakan Zhamanak detailed 
this accusation in a front-page article published 
November 23.  The businessman denied the allegations 
publicly the same day; the police reported that 
mechanical failure caused the fire.  End Summary. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
CAR DAMAGED BY FIRE, EDITOR MAKES ALLEGATION 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) November 23, immediately after reading press 
reports about the destruction of his personal vehicle, 
we met with the Editor-in-Chief of Haykakan Zhamanak, 
Nikol Pashinyan, at his office.  His \"Niva\" (a 
relatively inexpensive Russian-made four-wheel drive 
vehicle)caught fire November 22 at 20:40.  Pashinyan 
said that he and his staff heard a loud noise and, 
looking through the window, saw the vehicle engulfed in 
flame. The fire department responded to their call, \"as 
quickly as they could,\" he said, and doused the fire 
without any explosion. 
 
4. (SBU) We arrived for our meeting to find the car 
still parked by the front door of Haykakan Zhamanak\'s 
offices.  The vehicle, with melted tires, a broken 
windshield and charred exterior, evidenced severe fire 
damage.  The inside of the passenger compartment, 
however, appeared to have not been damaged by fire. 
 
5. (U) Pashinyan, in a front-page article on November 
23, accused one of the most prominent businessmen in 
Armenia and National Assembly member, Gagik Tsarukyan, 
of ordering the destruction of his car in retaliation 
for negative press coverage.  At a public event, with 
President Kocharian present, Tsarukyan denied 
involvement.  The Embassy has no evidence that would 
confirm this allegation. 
 
------------------------------- 
Criminal Investigation Unlikely 
------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) In a November 23rd statement at the Yerevan 
Press Club, The Committee to Protect Freedom of Speech, 
an umbrella organization for the Armenian press, 
denounced what they saw as an example of press 
intimidation and chastised the police for failing to 
properly investigate \"similar incidents\" in the past. 
They went on to demand a \"serious and objective 
investigation.\" 
 
----------------------------------------- 
POLICE:  SPONTANEOUS VEHICULAR COMBUSTION 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) November 24, the police officially reported 
that the cause of the fire was \"the result of faulty 
wiring in the car\'s battery.\"  The police did not 
mention a criminal investigation.  (Note:  When we 
arrived at Pashinyan\'s office he was being questioned 
by police investigators.  They remained on the premises 
throughout our visit.  End Note.)  According to 
Pashinyan, the Deputy Fire Chief remarked while 
examining the blackened car, this \"happens quite often 
naturally.\" 
 
-------------------------------------- 
EDITOR PROCLAIMS PAPER \"TOTALLY FREE\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Energetic and edgy during our meeting, 
Pashinyan described the destruction of his car as a 
positive development.  \"Thankfully no one was hurt, we 
survived this test, and now they know that we will not 
be deterred from publishing the truth by any thuggish 
action,\" he proclaimed.  Pashinyan stated that he does 
not fear any further acts of intimidation.  \"Now I am 
confident we can report everything and talk about 
anyone.  We are totally free.\" 
----------------------------- 
COMMENT: ROOM FOR SPECULATION 
----------------------------- 
7. (SBU) Haykakan Zhamanak has a reputation for 
publishing unfounded stories that tend not to be borne 
out.  Pashinyan\'s allegation that the destruction of 
his car was an act of intimidation has not been 
substantiated.  That being said, there have been other 
alleged incidents of mistreatment of the press in 
Armenia recently (reftel).  The authorities\' suggestion 
that Pashinyan\'s car died of natural causes is hard to 
swallow.  We will continue to follow this case closely 
and work to support press freedom in Armenia.

1. (SBU) Hasmik Hakobyan, a former trafficking victim 
who has been working with the International 
Organization on Migration (IOM) office in Yerevan, was 
arrested on charges of organizing prostitution November 
16, 2004.  Hakobyan purportedly arranged to send two 
women to her former traffickers in Dubai, allegedly in 
an effort to recover money from the traffickers.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------- 
DETAILS OF THE CASE 
------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) According to case materials, Hasmik Hakobyan 
had connections with a woman in Dubai Anahit Malkhasyan 
who was engaged in trafficking.  Hakobyan had made an 
arrangement with Malkasyan and four of her associates 
(Nanasil Arakelyan, Anahit Grigoryan, Siranush 
Musaelyan and Nelli Harutiunyan), and recruited Liana 
Mkrtchyan and Elmira Hakobyan in August and tried to 
send them to Dubai to engage in prostitution in 
September.  Those actions were prevented when the 
mother of one of the girls applied to the Yerevan 
Police Department, which opened an investigation in 
this case. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
BACKGROUND OF THE SUSPECT AND THE IOM LINK 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (SBU) Hasmik Hakobyan is a former victim of 
trafficking, who is engaged in IOM\'s trafficking 
victims\' assistance activities.  Hakobyan has also 
helped implement an IOM project \"Performance against 
Trafficking,\" and shared her experiences as a former 
victim of trafficking.  According to IOM, Hakobyan had 
connected two women, allegedly prostitutes, with her 
trafficker, in return for money or the promise of 
money.  She had been invited to the Prosecutor 
General\'s office to testify, where she provided 
evidence against herself.  Following this, the 
Prosecutor\'s office pressed charges against her and 
demanded her arrest.  Hakobyan subsequently recanted 
her earlier testimony and is currently being held in 
court-authorized pretrial detention. 
 
---------------------- 
COMMENT:  A MESSY CASE 
---------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Martin Wyss, the former Head of IOM in 
Yerevan, told us the case against Hakobyan was 
\"tragic.\"  He said that he believed Hakobyan when she 
told him she was seeking to repay a debt to her former 
traffickers the only way she knew how:  by engaging in 
trafficking herself.  While this case may be a blow to 
IOM\'s anti-trafficking work (which we support) we will 
encourage the GOAM to prosecute this and every other 
trafficking case to the full extent of the law.

1.  (C) The decision not to send a delegation to NATO\'s 
Rose-Roth seminar in Baku was \"difficult to understand\" and 
\"a mistake\" for Armenia.\"  That was the message the 
Ambassador delivered to Tigran Torosian, Deputy Speaker of 
Armenia\'s National Assembly (NA) during a November 26 office 
call.  Torosian told the Ambassador that the decision not to 
send the delegation was taken primarily by NA Speaker Artur 
Baghdasarian.  Baghdasarian had sent a letter to his 
counterpart in Baku requesting a personal security guarantee 
but had received no direct reply.  Torosian admitted that 
Baghdasarian\'s decision seemed to be based as much on his 
affront at not receiving a reply as on his concern for the 
security of the parliamentarians and staffers slated to 
attend the conference.  Torosian also whined about Azeri 
non-attendance at some earlier events hosted by the National 
Assembly in Yerevan. 
 
2.  (C) The Ambassador pointed out the many steps that the 
USG and NATO had taken to ensure security of all delegations. 
 Armenia\'s absence at the conference showed a lack of 
readiness to engage.  The Ambassador suggested that Armenia 
take prompt steps to remedy this mistake, preferably by 
Oskanian\'s agreeing to meet with FM Mammadyarov as soon as 
possible. 
 
3.  (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Tatul Margarian told us 
November 26 that the Foreign Ministry was not involved in the 
decision to withhold the delegation; he assumed it was made 
by Baghdasarian.  The Government\'s readiness in general to 
engage in Baku was made clear by the attendance of senior 
GOAM officials in Azerbaijan at recent symposia on energy and 
transport.  He understood how this decision would be taken in 
Washington, at NATO and elsewhere, and recognized that 
Armenia had made a misstep.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) On November 23, Armenia\'s National Assembly 
amended legislation that provides draftees with a 
mechanism to apply for an alternative to military 
service.  These amendments clear the way for full 
implementation of the alternative military service law 
that was passed in November 2003 as part of Armenia\'s 
compliance with Council of Europe commitments.  This 
fall, the Ministry of Defense accepted approximately 
twenty applications for alternative military service 
from new draftees and intends to process the 
applications before the recruits begin military 
service.  The GOAM has not set a timeline for the 
release of conscientious objectors currently serving 
prison sentences.  End Summary. 
 
-------------- 
THE AMENDMENTS 
-------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The approved amendments make several important 
changes to Armenia\'s law on alternatives to military 
service.  The category of \"civil\" (i.e. completely non- 
military) service was added to the legislation, 
enabling conscious objectors to work in hospitals and 
other public facilities rather than the military.  The 
amendments also centralized the process of application 
and review.  Both civil and alternative military 
service will last 42 months in contrast to the current 
24 months draftees spend in the army. 
 
-------------------- 
OVERCOMING OBSTACLES 
-------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Since the original law passed in November 
2003, bureaucratic roadblocks have dogged 
implementation of the legislation.  The Ministry of 
Defense did not complete recommendations on the 
amendments until June of this year, missing the spring 
legislative session (reftel A).  While waiting for the 
amendments, the GOAM did not begin work on the 
logistics of implementation (reftel B).  However, a 
Ministry of Defense (MOD) spokesman argued that the 
Government had not missed its deadline since the MOD 
accepted applications this fall, and the review board 
would make decisions before the new recruits begin 
active duty next year. 
 
---------------- 
WORK TO COMPLETE 
---------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Several obstacles still exist before the law 
can operate smoothly.  The local representative of the 
Jehovah\'s Witnesses told us that he did know that the 
MOD was already accepting applications for alternatives 
to military service.  He said it was the Government\'s 
responsibility to inform all draftees of the new 
program.  He also stated that he knew of no procedure 
for the release of conscientious objectors who were 
convicted under previous law.  (Note:  ten 
conscientious objectors are serving prison terms and 
three are awaiting trial for draft evasion.  End note.) 
A committee must still decide the composition and 
operation of the application review committee. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) While work is not fully complete on an 
effective system, the Armenian law on alternatives to 
military service appears to be closer to a reality.  We 
understand the MOD may be somewhat irritated by being 
forced to implement this program.  Local conscientious 
objectors are not quite sure they got what they asked 
for.

On November 23, the Armenian Constitutional Court 
approved the GOAM\'s signing of the \"Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
sale of children, child prostitution, and child 
pornography.\"  The treaty now moves to the National 
Assembly for final ratification.  According to local 
UNICEF officer Naira Avetisyan, the National Assembly 
hopes to ratify this and the Optional Protocol on the 
involvement of children in armed conflicts by year\'s 
end.  Avetesyan stated that the National Assembly would 
not need to change Armenian law in order to comply with 
either protocol.  She explained that \"The Law on Child 
Rights,\" passed in 1996, closely mirrors the 
\"Convention on the Rights of the Child\" because the 
Soviet Union was a signatory to the convention and the 
Armenian law was modeled on Soviet law.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Despite the absence of formal legal instruments 
regulating law enforcement cooperation between the U.S. and 
Armenia, cooperation with the GOAM on specific cases has 
produced positive results. From working on child pornography 
cases to tracking down, arresting and transferring fugitive 
murder suspects to seizing assets, Armenian officials have 
demonstrated they are ready to help us.  This relationship 
results from active engagement by Embassy officials, 
especially by the RSO, concrete, targeted  assistance 
projects funded by INL and others, but also from Armenia\'s 
generally positive view of the U.S. as a partner, if not 
always an ally.  We will look to build on these successes and 
to institutionalize some aspects of our cooperation.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) As a rule, Armenia\'s law enforcement organizations 
are in bad shape.  Weak democratic institutions, lack of 
resources, poorly-motivated, poorly-trained personnel and, of 
course, corruption, are factors limiting their performance. 
Together with other donors, U.S. assistance programs are 
working to address this shortcoming and have achieved some 
measure of success.  Training, assistance in reforming 
legislation and equipment continue to be our priorities.  A 
by-product of this engagement is a constructive relationship 
with Armenia\'s law enforcement agencies and also a positive 
general attitude toward the U.S.  Our relationships with the 
National Security Service (NSS) and with the office of 
Armenia\'s Prosecutor General have been the most productive. 
This cable highlights some of our recent efforts. 
 
Child Pornography Case 
---------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) In November 2002, we worked with the NSS to 
investigate Armenia\'s first internet child pornography case. 
The lead in this investigation originated from Illinois via 
U.S. Customs agents in Chicago.  The main Armenian suspect 
was employed at the Armenian telecom company and was arrested 
with hundreds of CDs of pornography at his residence. 
Because of a shortcoming in Armenian law, the suspect escaped 
prosecution, but a ring to distribute material beyond Armenia 
was broken. 
 
Fugitive Murder Suspect Detained and Transferred 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4.  (SBU) The RSO used a June 2003 visit by the Ambassador to 
Glendale, California (where many Armenian emigrants have 
settled) to develop close professional ties with local- and 
federal-level law enforcement authorities there.  This 
investment continues to pay dividends.  In February 2004, 
Glendale PD learned that an ethnic Armenian murder suspect 
fled the U.S. for Armenia.  Despite the absence of a Mutual 
Legal Assistance Treaty or an Extradition Treaty, Glendale PD 
and the RSO worked with the NSS to conduct wiretaps (both in 
the U.S. and in Armenia).  The suspect was returned to the 
U.S. for trial. 
 
Alien Smuggler Sting 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) In June 2004, the NSS, working with DHS/ICE Long 
Beach and the RSO carried out a successful sting operation 
against an Armenian-American alien smuggler.  After NSS 
surveillance and wiretaps, the smuggler was arrested at the 
Yerevan airport while trying to bribe a border guard.  The 
subject is now on trial in Armenia, but the DHS investigation 
into related activities continues. 
 
Cocaine Bust 
------------ 
 
6.  (SBU) In July 2004, the NSS arrested an Armenian national 
attempting to smuggle cocaine into Russia.  Investigation 
revealed that there have been previous shipments of cocaine 
with different \"mules.\"  DEA/Istanbul and NSS are continuing 
to cooperate on the investigation as it appears that Armenian 
groups in the Los Angeles area may be the source of the drugs. 
 
Fraudulent Bank Transfer Frozen 
------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) In August 2004, U.S. Secret Service notified post 
that a fraudulent wire transfer had been sent from a bank in 
Southern California to a recipient in Armenia.  Although part 
of the fraudulently transferred funds were released by the 
local bank, prompt action by post with the NSS and the 
Central Bank of Armenia prevented the release of the 
remaining USD 275,000.  Based on information provided by the 
U.S. Secret Service, Armenia\'s Prosecutor initiated a 
criminal case against the suspect, who remains in custody 
while the investigation is ongoing. 
 
Vehicular Homicide Suspect Will Face Justice in U.S. 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8.  (SBU) In October 2004, post took advantage of an 
INL-funded training course on crime scene investigation 
taught by Glendale, California detectives to follow up on 
several open cases.  One such case involved a suspect in a 
vehicular homicide who fled the U.S.  Glendale PD detectives, 
working with the RSO and the NSS, located the suspect.  With 
the assent of Armenia\'s Prosecutor General, the suspect was 
arrested and was deported from Armenia on November 9 in the 
custody of an FBI agent and an LAPD detective. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Our engagement with Armenia\'s law enforcement 
organizations is producing results, but we look to move 
beyond the ad hoc nature of this relationship.  Considering 
the size of the Armenian Diaspora in the U.S. and the 
enduring ties between some elements of that community and 
Armenia, it may now be time to consider more formal bilateral 
arrangements to regulate our legal cooperation.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) The November 26, 2004 sentencing of six Armenians (a 
pilot and crew) in Equatorial Guinea for aiding the overthrow 
of President Obiang\'s government (reftel) is a reminder about 
the business-end of Armenia\'s \"don\'t ask, don\'t tell\" policy 
on airline registration.  Armenia\'s Directorate of Civil 
Aviation licenses a dozen cargo airlines that operate 
exclusively outside Armenia -- more than the number of 
airlines that operate inside Armenia.  According to the GOAM, 
cargo airlines find it \"convenient\" to register their 
companies and planes in Armenia even though they operate 
between Russia and African states or solely between African 
states.  Not least of these conveniences is that Armenia 
lacks the resources to carry out inspections or to oversee 
the airlines operating abroad, letting these planes fall into 
a regulatory black hole.  Suddenly worried that accidents 
abroad could call attention to their nonfeasance, Armenia\'s 
Civil Aviation authorities are trying to make agreements with 
aviation authorities of various African states to assume 
partial regulatory oversight of the aircrafts.  We see little 
legitimate benefit to Armenia from licensing these airlines, 
but the reputation risk could be great should too many of the 
planes prove unsafe or turn up being used for criminal 
purposes.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
ARMENIA: A LIBERIA FOR AIRLINES? 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) The Director of International Relations for the 
Directorate of Civil Aviation, Karen Zadoyan, told us that 
many private cargo airlines operating Russian aircraft in 
Africa find it easier to register their planes and businesses 
in Armenia than elsewhere.  This creates a problem for the 
Directorate of Civil Aviation because they lack the resources 
to oversee the operation of the planes, which occurs 
exclusively outside Armenia.  According to Zadoyan, Armenian 
planes are filling an international niche, because Armenia 
still has the Soviet-trained pilots and crew to operate cheap 
Russian aircraft.  He said that he does not believe that lack 
of oversight is a factor in why these airlines choose to 
register in Armenia. 
 
3.  (C) According to Zadoyan, these cargo companies have 
similar origins:  middle-men from United Arab Emirates find 
Armenian business partners to set up airlines in Armenia. 
Although Zadoyan would not specifically name the Armenian 
owners of these airlines, he commented that airline companies 
must have partial Armenian ownership and frequently have 
Armenian pilots and crew.  Zadoyan added that the planes 
should periodically fly to Yerevan for servicing and 
inspection.  When we mentioned that the managers of 
Zvartnots, Yerevan\'s only commercial airport, didn\'t know 
anything about the airlines, Zadoyan replied that many of the 
airlines \"find it more convenient\" to land at Erebuni, 
Yerevan\'s military airport.  (Comment:  Among the 
conveniences at Erebuni airport are the lack of customs 
facilities and the denial of access to the public.  End 
Comment.) Although Zvartnots International Airport should 
have a monopoly on all commercial cargo traffic, an airport 
official at Erebuni recently told the DATT that the airport 
had improved its runway for use for commercial cargo traffic. 
 
------------------------------- 
WHAT ARE THESE PLANES CARRYING? 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Zadoyan said that his office doesn\'t ask or check 
what the cargo is on these planes, but he assumes it is 
mostly \"clothes and food.\"  Zadoyan said they would only 
investigate the cargo in the event that something happened. 
For example he mentioned that when an Armenian flagged plane 
crashed in the Sudan two years ago, its cargo was two tons of 
(unspecified) currency.  As for the Armenian-registered AN-12 
aircraft seized by the government of Equatorial Guinea 
resulting in the November 26 sentencing of six Armenian crew 
members to 14 - 24 years of imprisonment, Zadoyan said that 
he did not know what their cargo was.  Tiga Airlines\' 
director, Boris Avagian, has made a public statement that the 
plane was carrying Russian supplies to oil companies 
operating in Equatorial Guinea. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C) Armenia\'s self-aknowledged lack of resources to 
oversee these airlines risks making Armenia an attractive 
country of registry for those airlines seeking to avoid 
government oversight.  Because these airlines do not fly 
cargo to or from Armenia, the Armenian government receives 
little legitimate benefit from licensing these airlines. 
Doubtless, Armenia\'s well-developed custom of turning a blind 
eye in exchange for bribes may have given it a comparative 
advantage in the registration of aircraft. But Armenia\'s 
civil aviation authorities have put their reputation and that 
of other Armenian flagged airlines at risk should one of 
these airlines turn out to be usafe or used for criminal 
purposes.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Lack of transparency in recent GOAM financial actions 
is an increasing concern for the representatives of the IMF 
and World Bank in Yerevan.  Because Armenia continues to 
record steady economic growth and will likely continue to 
meet criteria set by both the Fund and the Bank, these 
concerns will probably not have an immediate effect on their 
programs.  The World Bank raised concerns about transparency 
just prior to a November 18 board meeting, but nevertheless 
approved a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC).  The IMF 
-- in advance of its board meeting on December 1 -- wrote to 
Armenia\'s Prime Minister to flag its concerns about: 
 
-- The award of a second mobile contract to K-Telecom without 
an open tender process; 
-- The transfer of profits from a large copper mine to a 
defense oriented foundation; 
-- The Central Bank\'s failure to liquidate an insolvent 
commercial bank and opaque dealings with that bank\'s single 
asset, the Nairit Chemical Factory; 
-- The failure of the government to pass a draft anti-money 
laundering law without amendments easing reporting 
requirements on international money transfers; and 
-- The failure of the government to pass a law requiring the 
use of cash registers in order to tackle tax evasion. 
 
While the GOAM has moved forward with the two legislative 
requirements (perhaps prompted by the IMF\'s query), we share 
the concerns of the IFI\'s about the GOAM\'s opaque dealings. 
End Summary. 
 
----------------------- 
DODGY TELECOM TENDER... 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) The GOAM recently ended a prolonged dispute with its 
monopoly telephone service provider Armentel in a deal that 
gave little to consumers or the Armenian government (ref A). 
While Armenia did restrict Armentel\'s monopoly to allow a 
second mobile service provider, it gave the second license 
away in a closed, six-hour nighttime tender to 
Karabakh-Telecom for only USD 7 million, USD 2 million of 
which went not to the government budget but to a private 
non-profit organization that sponsors infrastructure 
reconstruction in Nagorno-Karabakh.  As part of the deal the 
GOAM expanded Armentel\'s remaining monopoly to include Voice 
over Internet Protocol (VoIP), closing many existing firms 
and maintaining Armentel\'s ability to charge high rates on 
international phone calls.  While we have been told that the 
GOAM had political reasons to support Karabakh-Telecom, the 
lack of transparency in the tender process and the fact that 
the GOAM paid a potentially high price to Armentel in 
exchange for the mobile monopoly 
has raised concerns among IFI\'s and in the press about the 
propriety of the deal.  Several newspapers have accused the 
Minister of Justice, the deal\'s broker, of having a corrupt 
interest in the deal. 
 
------------------------- 
...DODGY PROFIT TRANSFERS 
------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) In August 2004, the GOAM issued a decree that 
transferred the earnings from the profitable state-owned 
Zangezour Copper Molybdenum plant to a foundation that had 
been created two days earlier (ref B).  Although the 
foundation\'s board members are unknown, it is registered at 
the address of another foundation controlled by Armenia\'s top 
military brass.  These assets (USD 20 million per year) could 
be used for off-budget military spending on Karabakh as well 
as for the personal use of those who control the foundation. 
 
------------------ 
...DODGY BANK DEAL 
------------------ 
 
4. (C) The Central Bank has decided to rehabilitate rather 
than liquidate ArmCommunications Bank, whose main asset, the 
dilapidated and obsolete Nairit Chemical Plant, must be worth 
more than fourteen million dollars for the bank to be 
solvent.  Central Bank board Member Vache Gabrielyan told us 
that one of Armenia\'s oligarch oil importers acquired 
ArmCommunications Bank from the Central Bank in order to 
strike a deal on the chemical plant.  The Central Bank has 
given the bank\'s new owner six months to sell Nairit or the 
Central Bank will reassert supervision over the bank.  The 
IMF\'s concern is that the Central Bank has not followed its 
procedures for evaluating the solvency of this bank but has 
been pressured to keep an insolvent bank alive to benefit a 
few businessmen who are the bank\'s depositors. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) We share the concerns of the IMF and the World Bank 
about the transparency of the three deals outlined above.  We 
believe that the GOAM has also paid short shrift to its 
international obligations:  the sudden Karabakh-Telecom deal 
seems to violate Armenia\'s WTO telecommunications commitments 
in its General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) 
schedule. 
 
6.  (C) The Minister of Justice has requested a meeting with 
our USAID director to request technical assistance related to 
the telecommunications sector.  We plan to echo the concerns 
of our colleagues in the IFIs about transparency and the 
appearance of impropriety in the recent telecommunications 
deals and the apparent violation of Armenia\'s WTO 
obligations.  We plan to inform the Ministry that the GOAM 
will have to clean up its act before it can expect USG 
assistance in this sector.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (U) Following is Yerevan\'s response to ref A request for 
information. 
 
Section A:  Overview of Military Expenditure Audits 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2.  (U) The primary responsibility for auditing the GOAM\'s 
military spending lies with the Ministry of Defense\'s 
internal auditing mechanism, the Department of Financial 
Inspection.  The Defense Ministry\'s Department of Financial 
Inspection conducts internal audits and reports to the 
Minister of Defense.  The framework for the internal auditors 
is decided annually upon receipt of the Ministry\'s budget 
allotment. 
 
3.  (U) The Ministry of Finance and Economy is also charged 
to audit military spending to the level of \"the most detailed 
version of the government budget.\"  The Ministry of Finance 
and Economy may review budget expenditures for military 
spending before the funds are allocated and again at the time 
of disbursement.  Upon request of the Prime Minister, the 
Ministry of Finance and Economy may carry out a special 
inspection to ensure proper use of the budget funds for 
military expenditures, but the Prime Minister has never 
exercised this option. 
 
4.  (U) The National Assembly has a Supervisory Committee 
that is charged with auditing any part of the government 
budget upon request of a Deputy of Parliament, although this 
committee has never reviewed defense expenditures. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  While Armenia claims it does not provide 
for the defense of the self-proclaimed \"Republic of 
Nagorno-Karabakh,\" in fact it is common knowledge that it 
does.  Funds for this purpose are not accounted for in public 
documents and are therefore not subject to independent 
oversight.  End Comment. 
 
Section B: The Military Budget 
------------------------------ 
 
6.  (U) The state budget has separate lines for the Ministry 
of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior (security 
enforcement). 
 
7.  (C) Several mechanisms exist for significant off-budget 
spending for defense purposes, including the transfer of 
state revenues to foundations and the direct sale of state 
assets (ref. B).  The Ministry of Defense reportedly uses 
these assets to provide for the defense of Nagorno-Karabakh 
(see above).  Because there is no effective independent 
oversight of these expenditures, it is widely suspected that 
senior Ministry of Defense officials take advantage of these 
off-budget funds for personal use. 
 
Section C: Spending Priorities 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  (C) In the official state budget, national defense, 
national security and law enforcement spending in 2004 was 
74.7 bln dram (USD 150 million), or 23.6 percent of the 
budget.  Spending on the social sector, (health care 
education and culture) was 111.7 billion AMD (USD 220 
million) or 35.5 percent of the budget.  There was debate in 
Parliament this year after the Minister of Defense objected 
that defense spending was less than spending on education for 
the first time.  The Ministry of Defense also typically 
benefits from supplemental spending bills throughout the year 
as well as off-budget expenditures.

CLOSER TIES WITH THE U.S. 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John M. Evans for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  In his first meeting with the Ambassador, 
General-Colonel Mikhael Harutiunyan expressed Armenia\'s 
readiness to send its military contingent to Iraq once the 
government had completed the necessary review and approval. 
He commented on the budgetary challenges facing the MOD and 
the attempts of both Armenia and Azerbaijan to increase their 
military capabilities.  The Ambassador inquired about the 
apparent acceleration of an arms race in the South Caucasus.. 
Harutiunyan repeated Armenia\'s desire to spend all of its 
available FMF funds on modernizing its military 
communications system.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  On December 1, the Ambassador paid his initial 
office call on Armenia\'s First Deputy Minister of Defense and 
Chief of the Main Staff, General-Colonel Mikhael Harutiunyan. 
 With Harutiunyan was General-Major Mikhael Melkonyan, Head 
of the MOD\'s Department of Foreign Relations and Military 
Cooperation.  DATT and ODC Chief accompanied the Ambassador. 
 
U.S. Visit Praised 
------------------ 
 
3.  (C)  Harutiunyan opened by stating his gratitude to the 
U.S. for arranging his recent counterpart visit with the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and proudly showed the 
Ambassador the Legion of Merit he was awarded during the 
visit.  He commented on the importance of the visit in 
developing deeper U.S.- Armenian military relations.  He 
praised the professionalism of the U.S. generals he met, 
noting that although U.S. generals represent the most 
powerful military in the world, they are not overbearing and 
Harutiunyan felt he was treated as an equal.  He contrasted 
this with the attitude of Russian generals, whom he described 
as \"rude.\" 
 
Court Ruling on Iraq Deployment Postponed 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Harutiunyan reported that the Constitutional Court 
would begin to review the terms of the planned deployment to 
Iraq on December 8.  He added that the Armenian soldiers are 
fully trained at ready to deploy at any moment.  He mentioned 
that Armenia is discussing the possibility of its soldiers 
using the trucks left behind when Hungary pulls its 
transportation unit out of Iraq.  He seemed to favor this 
option, noting that the Hungarian trucks were newer and more 
capable than the trucks Armenia is planning to deploy. 
Harutiunyan acknowledged that many Armenians are concerned 
about the safety of Armenian communities in the Middle East 
should the deployment go forward and stated that political 
opposition will try to use this to score points against 
President Kocharian. 
 
The Military Balance 
-------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  The Ambassador asked Harutiunyan to comment on what 
could be perceived as an arms race developing between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan.  Harutiunyan acknowledged that Azerbaijan has 
superior manpower and financial resources.  Armenia is 
therefore choosing to focus its resources on maintaining a 
high degree of training and readiness in the military.  He 
emphasized that the MOD will continue to modernize its 
military hardware, such as T-72 tanks and BMP armored 
infantry fighting vehicles to make them more mobile and 
capable.  He confirmed that the MOD is in the process of 
acquiring 10 SU-25 ground attack aircraft from Slovakia. 
 
6.  (C) The Ambassador then mentioned that Defense Minister 
Sargsyan had recently called for an increase in the defense 
budget for 2005.  Harutiunyan stated that these increase were 
necessary to provide across-the-board pay increases for the 
military and to compensate for the rise in costs associated 
with the fall in the value of the dollar.  He mentioned that 
this has affected prices in Armenia in general, but singled 
out fuel as one area of particular concern. 
 
7.  (C) Harutiunyan stated that the Azerbaijani military was 
in no position to undertake offensive operations, since it 
did not have the combat power to overtake Armenian defensive 
positions that have been steadily improved over the course of 
12 years.  Because of the entrenched positions on both sides, 
he predicted that whichever side initiated offensive actions 
in would lose any conflict.  Harutiunyan added that Armenia 
would not give Azerbaijan a pretext for restarting the 
conflict, but warned that Azerbaijan would attack as soon as 
it felt confident in the possibility of victory. 
 
8.  (C) Harutiunyan voiced his concern that a relatively 
minor incident along the line of contact could start a chain 
reaction which could lead to renewed hostilities.  At this 
point he noted that Azerbaijani forces had captured three 
Armenian soldiers who got lost in the fog along the 
line-of-contact three days earlier.  He claimed that 
Azerbaijan was not responding to Armenian attempts to discuss 
the release of the soldiers.  (Note: This is not the first 
time this has occurred; in a follow-up call, MOD officials 
told us that the three Armenian soldiers are now in Baku. 
Another Armenian soldier who wandered from his post was also 
taken by Azeri forces, claims the MOD.  Armenia has one Azeri 
soldier in custody and claimed it sought to make an exchange, 
but with no success.  End note.) 
 
9.  (C) Harutiunyan claimed Baku was increasing its military 
budget for 2005 by USD 57 million and that Azerbaijan was 
receiving military support from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. 
He alleged that Azerbaijan had already exceeded its 
CFE-imposed limits for tanks by 50 percent and artillery by 
300 percent. 
 
Continued Focus on Military Communications 
------------------------------------------ 
 
10.  (C)  Harutiunyan took the opportunity to repeat his 
desire for the U.S. to permit Armenia to focus all of its 
available FMF funding on modernizing its military 
communications system until the project is complete.  He 
criticized the suggestion that Armenia consider spending FMF 
on its peacekeeping battalion before the communications 
modernization is finished, stating that this modernization 
effort should be completed as quickly as possible due to the 
danger of maintaining two incompatible communications 
systems.  After ODC Chief noted that the FMF program was not 
designed for long-term equipment procurement, he contended 
that the U.S. agreed in principle to allow Armenia to 
implement this project when Armenia declared its intention to 
fully modernize its military communications two year ago. 
Perhaps not noting the contradiction in his request, 
Harutiunyan repeated a request for the U.S. to help the MOD 
develop a peacekeeping brigade.

SUBJECT: NEW ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAW MOVING FORWARD 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) On November 24, 2004 the Armenian parliament 
adopted the first reading of the Law Against Money 
Laundering and Terrorist Finance, which is intended to 
implement recommendations that MoneyVal (the Council of 
Europe\'s committee on anti-money laundering) made during its 
review of Armenia earlier this year.  The law will 
significantly improve Armenia\'s regime for the control of 
money laundering by establishing a single Financial 
Intelligence Unit (FIU), consolidating reporting 
requirements for large money transfers and all suspicious 
transactions, and bringing banks, non-banking financial 
institutions and casinos under the same legal framework.  In 
addition, the law specifically criminalizes the financing of 
terrorism.  While the law may face some minor changes during 
its second and third readings, the parliament has committed 
to it in principle by adopting the first reading.  The 
Central Bank has told us that it expects parliament to pass 
the law substantially unchanged before the New Year.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT TO BE CREATED IN CENTRAL BANK 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2.  (SBU) Following the passage of the first reading of the 
new anti-money laundering law, the Central Bank has the 
mandate to proceed with the establishment of a Financial 
Intelligence Unit (FIU).  Nerses Yeritsyan, Advisor to the 
Central Bank Chairman, is charged to form the FIU and create 
banking procedures and by-laws to implement the FIU\'s 
reporting regime.  Yeritsyan told us that he would be the 
head of the FIU, \"at least in the beginning.\"  The FIU will 
be an independent body that reports to the chairman of the 
Central Bank.  Its mandate will be limited to gathering 
intelligence and analyzing it.  The FIU will transfer cases 
to the Procurator General for enforcement.  Yeritsyan said 
that he expects the FIU to be fully operational by mid-2005. 
The draft 
 
3.  According to Yeritsyan, the new anti-money laundering 
law and the creation of a new FIU are steps towards meeting 
MoneyVal\'s recommendations by the February 2005 deadline. 
When asked about joining the Egmont group, Yeritsyan said 
that he intends to work toward it but that the FIU as 
envisaged by the new legislation lacks legal competency to 
deal directly with FIU\'s of other countries. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
DRAFT LAW CRIMINALIZES TERRORIST FINANCE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  The new draft anti-money laundering law also contains 
provisions to strengthen Armenia\'s legislation to combat 
terrorist finance by specifically criminalizing acts that 
assist the financing of terrorism.  We will report this 
septel, once the law has passed its final reading. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
4.  (SBU) While the new money-laundering law is a step 
forward, there are still some gaps.  Only some institutions 
covered by the new law will report directly to the FIU. 
Casinos and insurance companies will still report to their 
regulators in the Ministry of Finance, who will then forward 
suspicious cases to the FIU.  It is not clear what 
competence the FIU will have to investigate on its own 
initiative institutions that do not report directly to it. 
Additionally, the new law lacks clear procedures for 
freezing or confiscating assets, although Yeritsyan tells us 
that by-laws will put measures in place.  Yeritsyan told us 
that he intends to approach international donors for 
assistance in three areas, technical assistance in the 
creation of procedures, by-laws and reporting systems, the 
set-up and maintenance of databases, and training for the 
officials at banks and exchange offices who are required to 
report suspicious transactions.

ASSISTANCE FOR ARMENIA 
 
REF: YEREVAN 2604 
 
1. On November 24 the National Assembly of Armenia 
adopted the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist 
Financing Bill in the first reading (ref).  The 
adoption of the bill sanctions the Central Bank of 
Armenia to proceed with the establishment of the 
Financial Intelligence Unit as proposed in the law. 
MONEVAL\'s evaluation team has said that creation of an 
FIU in Armenia is a matter of urgency.  By the end of 
the first round of the Armenia assessment in the 
framework of MONEYVAL in February 2005, The Government 
of Armenia is to have passed the Anti-Money Laundering 
Law and to have established the FIU. 
 
2. The Central Bank of Armenia has been requesting 
assistance in establishment of the FIU from Embassy 
Yerevan for several months.  $100,000 of FY2001 Embassy 
Yerevan INL funding was obligated to the Department of 
the Treasury Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) for 
anti-money laundering assistance for Armenia.  No 
assistance has yet been provided.  Now is the time to 
engage with the GOAM to provide expertise in an area 
critical to U.S. policy goals. 
 
3. Post requests that INL work with OTA in Washington 
to arrange for the visit of an FIU expert to Armenia in 
January 2005 to advise the Government of Armenia and to 
assess what additional assistance is required.

1.  The Department on Migration and Refugees (DMR) has 
finished work with the Government of Qatar to create a 
legal framework for Armenians working in Qatar.  In the 
agreement (scheduled to be signed in the near future) 
the Government of Qatar has provided quotas for the 
workers in the following fields:  computer networks 
administration, database administration, programming, 
program analysis and nursing.  According to the DMR, 
Qatar will take care of all expenses, including those 
for transportation.  The DMR has already started 
advertising this opportunity and collecting 
applications. 
 
2.  Noting the large-scale illegal or semi-legal 
migration of Armenian workers, and noting the problem 
with trafficking exacerbated by labor migration 
problems, the DMR is taking considerable pride in the 
new agreement.  Lyalya Aslanyan, DMR Deputy Head, 
expressed the hope that this agreement with Qatar will 
serve as a precedent for cooperation with other 
countries, and will regularize labor migration.  In 
addition to this recent agreement, Ms. Aslanyan also 
noted a draft law \"On Organization of External Labor 
Migration,\" which the DMR has been working on for more 
than four years.  The DMR has already presented this 
draft to GOAM and expects that the National Assembly 
will adopt it either by the end of 2004 or in early 
2005.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) According to data on Trafficking in Persons 
(TIP) provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
for the period between January 1, 2004 and November 1, 
2004, there have been 15 cases of trafficking in 
Armenia involving 26 defendants.  While most of those 
people were sentenced to prison, the Article of the 
Criminal Code on Trafficking was applied only in one 
case.  Comparison with data for 2003 shows a 25 percent 
increase in cases investigated.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) Trafficking in persons was defined as a crime 
August 1, 2003 when the new Armenian Criminal Code 
entered into force.  TIP crimes committed prior to this 
date were prosecuted on charges of organization of 
prostitution (i.e., pimping).  Law-enforcement bodies 
have used the term \"pimping abroad\" in order to 
simplify statistics and differentiate trafficking from 
traditional forms of pimping.  The Criminal Code 
contains the following provisions:  trafficking in 
persons covered under Article 132; involvement in 
prostitution under Article 261; organization of 
prostitution (pimping) under Article 262. 
 
--------------------- 
CASES AND CONVICTIONS 
--------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Based on data provided by the Information 
Center of the Republic of Armenia (RA) Police, in the 
first eleven months of 2004 the Prosecutor\'s office and 
the Police have investigated 24 criminal cases of 
sexual exploitation of women involving 37 defendants. 
Fifteen of these cases (involving 26 people) were 
determined to be related to trafficking.  Those 26 
defendants received the following sentences: 
 
-- Imprisonment        --16 people (61.5 percent); 
-- Fines               -- 4 people (15.4 percent); 
-- Suspended sentences -- 4 people (15.4 percent); and 
-- Corrective Labor    -- 2 people ( 7.7 percent). 
 
These cases were prosecuted under Articles 261, 262 and 
132 of the Criminal Code. 
 
---------------- 
ARTICLES APPLIED 
---------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Article 132 on Trafficking was invoked only in 
one case involving 3 persons, who were all sentenced to 
prison (for terms ranging from 2 years to 4.5 years). 
Article 261 on Involvement into Prostitution was also 
applied once.  In this case the defendant was penalized 
in the amount of approximately USD 390.  Article 262 
was applied in 13 criminal cases involving 22 persons: 
13 of those were sentenced to jail (for terms ranging 
from 6 month to 3 years), 3 persons were penalized 
approximately USD 650, and 2 were sentenced to 
corrective labor. 
 
------------------------- 
COMPARISON WITH 2003 DATA 
------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Compared with data from 2003 (TIP Report 2004) 
these reports indicate a roughly 25 percent increase in 
the number of cases investigated.  In addition, 
traffickers prosecuted in 2004 received harsher 
punishments than during 2003.  In 2003 the police 
initiated 2 cases under Article 132 and 17 cases under 
Article 262.  Of the latter, however, only nine were 
trafficking cases (for a total of eleven cases).  The 
sentences handed down ranged from fines and 
correctional labor to one-year imprisonment.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Armenia\'s Constitutional Court ruled December 8 
that the agreement signed between Poland and Armenia 
regarding the dispatch of Armenian non-combat troops to Iraq 
does not run counter to the Armenian Constitution.  The 
court\'s decision paves the way for a parliamentary hearing 
and vote on the issue.  Sources indicate that the National 
Assembly will include the issue during planned extraordinary 
sessions in mid-December or in early January.  End summary.

CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF DEPLOYMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (SBU) Armenia\'s Constitutional Court ruled December 8 
that the agreement signed between Poland and Armenia 
regarding the dispatch of Armenian non-combat troops to Iraq 
does not run counter to the Armenian Constitution.  Under 
the September 6 memorandum of understanding, Armenia 
committed to send a contingent of 50 military doctors, 
demining specialists and drivers.  Defense Minister Serzh 
Sargsyan represented the GOAM during the court hearings and 
said that the Armenian military personnel would take part in 
humanitarian and defensive activities only.  Speaking in 
front of the panel of nine judges, Sargsyan strongly 
defended the GOAM\'s decision to deploy troops and argued 
that Armenia should not stay isolated from regional 
developments such as those taking place in Iraq. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
MID-DECEMBER OR EARLY JANUARY DEBATE DATES LIKELY 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
3. (SBU) The court ruling paved the way for parliamentary 
hearings on the issue.  Despite optimistic announcements by 
GOAM ministers regarding eventual deployment, the outcome of 
parliamentary debates still remains unclear.  Some MPs, 
including opposition figures, have raised doubts about the 
decision, citing concerns about the security of the 
estimated 25-30 thousand Iraqi-Armenians (reftel).  Although 
the current National Assembly session has technically ended, 
the legislature will likely convene two extraordinary 
sessions on other issues in mid-December and could, under 
its by-laws, include the deployment issue for discussion. 
Sources at the National Assembly told us they expected the 
GOAM to submit the issue of Iraq deployment for 
parliamentary debate before the end of year.  Ministry of 
Defense sources, however, said they expected a slightly 
different timetable that would put parliamentary discussion 
and voting in the early part of January 2005.

SUBJECT: RAIL BLOCKADE: TIGHTENING THE NOOSE AROUND ARMENIA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John M. Evans for reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) For more than twelve years, the blockade of Armenia 
by Turkey and Azerbaijan has disrupted regional transit 
corridors.  All political considerations aside, regional 
economic development has been stymied.  Recent steps by 
Azerbaijan to improve the effectiveness of its blockade have 
tightened the noose.  Armenia has a single active 
international rail crossing, through Georgia.  International 
freight arriving at this point must either arrive via the 
port of Poti (at significant cost), or through Azerbaijan. 
Press reports suggest that Azerbaijan is pressing Georgia 
hard to step up enforcement of agreements which prohibit 
trans-shipment of cargoes to Armenia.  More than 1000 
railcars intended for delivery to Armenia, primarily carrying 
fuel and grain, are now being held in Azerbaijan. 
 
2.  (C) The GOAM is feeling the pressure.  In addition to the 
immediate economic pressures of the blockade, a new rail line 
is under consideration to link the Turkish city of Kars 
directly to Georgia, bypassing Armenia.  The GOAM offered 
Turkey the use of the rail connection from Turkey to Georgia, 
even if only for transit purposes.  As he prepared for a 
recent trip to Turkey, President Putin told the press he 
would argue against construction of this line and the further 
economic isolation of Armenia. 
 
3.  (C) We think the proposed bypass would remove the 
incentive to develop the economic links which could bridge 
the political gaps that divide this region.  A rail bypass of 
Armenia would work against U.S. regional goals.  End Summary. 
 
ISLAND IN THE STREAM 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Situated on the historic silk road, less than 200 
miles from the busy ports on the Black Sea and 350 miles from 
the Caspian, Armenia nonetheless faces some of the highest 
transport costs in the world; a recent World Bank report 
compares costs as exceeded only by some \"African landlocked 
countries.\"  Azeri and Turkish borders are closed.  The road 
to Iran is steep, narrow, and perilous in winter.  Nearly 
ninety percent of goods (other than diamonds) imported to or 
exported from Armenia transit Georgia, where they incur high 
transit costs, both in terms of formal customs fees and also 
in what the World Bank report charitably termed \"informal 
transit costs.\" 
 
5.  (C) Goods that come to Georgia from the East which 
transit Azerbaijan must be consigned to Georgia and then 
resold to an Armenian importer, incurring customs duties and 
taxes in both Georgia and Armenia.  Armenian importers once 
solved this problem informally with Georgian customs 
officials.  \"Under Shevardnaze, we would just fix the 
paperwork,\" a senior customs official told us recently, but 
now Georgian officials are \"unfortunately are following the 
law.\" 
 
Azerbaijan Steps Up The Pressure 
-------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Azerbaijan in recent weeks has stepped up the 
pressure and is reportedly holding more than a thousand rail 
cars, mostly laden with grain and fuel, at the Georgian 
border on suspicion that they will be re-consigned to 
Armenia.  According to Deputy Minister of Trade Tigran 
Davtyan, the goods held are in fact bound for Armenia. 
Davtyan told us earlier that recent measures by Azerbaijan 
have caused shortages of aviation fuel in Yerevan, forcing 
Armenian airlines to stop in Sochi for refueling and driving 
the price of aviation fuel to more than USD 700 per ton in 
Yerevan.  According to press reports, the Azeri Embassy in 
Tbilisi has added a new officer whose sole duties are to 
enforce a CIS agreement which prohibits the improper 
re-consigning of cargoes. 
 
THE COST TO BUSINESS IS HIGH 
---------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) If the transit through Georgia is costly to 
importers, it is prohibitively expensive to businesses 
seeking to export from Armenia, whose goods -- save polished 
gems -- tend to be heavy for their value.  An American marble 
importer told us that to bring marble from Armenia to 
California he pays USD 4,000 per container, opposed to USD 
2,000 from across the border in eastern Turkey.  Another U.S. 
company that exports molybdenum from Armenia to Western 
Europe claims that the trip from Armenia to the Georgian port 
of Poti is the most expensive part of shipping costs, at USD 
1,500 per container.  Armenian freight forwarders point out 
that Georgia levies high transit fees (USD 300 per container 
plus ecological charges--higher for Armenians than for 
Azeris, despite the fact that both Georgia and Armenia are 
members of the WTO.  Freight companies also point to high 
risks due to corruption and poor infrastructure in Georgia. 
In total, Armenia\'s balance of payments shows a USD 90 
million debit for external freight charges -- more than one 
third the value of Armenia\'s total exports excluding precious 
gems. 
 
THE IRON CURTAIN\'S REMAINING CHINK 
---------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) In Soviet times the Gyumri-Kars railroad crossing 
over the Arax river on the eastern Turkish border was the 
only rail link between the Soviet Union and Turkey.  We 
recently visited the site and were struck by how much it 
still seems like a scene out of the cold war.  Russian border 
guards still man Armenia\'s borders with Iran and Turkey and 
our Armenian hosts had to seek their permission to approach 
the border post. 
 
9.  (C) Today, the rails lie unused.  Although idle since 
1992, the railway from the border to Gyumri is intact.  Three 
years ago the Armenian Customs Service refinished a building 
at the border for use as a customs house in the anticipation 
that the border would open soon.  The old Akhurik rail 
station (five kilometers from the Turkish border) needs new 
loading and unloading equipment, but the rails are 
operational. (Armenian trains, like Georgian and other Soviet 
trains, have a different gauge than Turkish trains.  Cargo 
would have to be transferred from the Turkish trains to 
Armenian trains at Akhurik.)  From Gyumri the current 
Armenian railroad provides service to Tbilisi. 
 
Armenia Seeks to Open Rail Link 
------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Armenians are acutely aware of their isolation. 
Foreign Minister Oskanian and his Deputy Tatoul Markarian 
told us that Armenia seeks the rehabilitation of existing 
rail infrastructure through the Caucasus.  During a September 
meeting, the press reported that President Kocharian asked 
Georgian President Saakashvili to help re-open the rail 
connection through Abkhazia, thereby providing a railroad 
link to Russia.  Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin 
recently announced that Russia agreed to re-open the line 
through Abkhazia, but we understand this will take more than 
a year to implement. 
 
11.  (C) Markarian told us the GOAM is willing to take bolder 
steps to encourage the use of the Gyumri-Kars railroad 
between Armenia and Turkey, including the use of the Armenian 
rail corridor by Turkey and Georgia without insisting on full 
normalization of trade ties.  Turkish cargoes would be 
permitted to transit to Georgia.  Markarian said Armenia 
offered to permit rail transit of cargoes bound for Iraq from 
Turkey and has also offered transit through Armenia for 
humanitarian goods from Turkey or Azerbaijan to the Azeri 
enclave of Nakhichevan.  Both offers were rejected in favor 
of maintaining the blockade, he asserted. 
 
12.  (C) The governments of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey 
reportedly made a proposal to the TRACECA (Transport Corridor 
Europe Caucasus Asia) forum to solicit EU financing to build 
a new route from Kars to Tbilisi, going around Armenia. 
Armenia\'s representative to TRACECA, Gagik Grigorian, told us 
that the EU\'s current position on the proposal to build a new 
railway was to encourage the use of existing rail 
infrastructure instead.  Grigoryan admitted that the 
realization of the new railway would ultimately be 
commercially determined, but contrasted the situation from 
the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline dispute:  \"If the demand is 
there (for cargo from Kars to Tbilisi) the railway already 
exists.  Rather than build a new railroad let\'s operate the 
existing system.\"  Russia has already spoken out against the 
new rail link.  In a press interview given in advance of his 
December 6-7 trip to Turkey, President Putin said that he 
planned to raise Russia\'s opposition to the new rail link as 
it would increase Armenia\'s isolation and would be a step 
away from resolving the ongoing conflict. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
13.  (C) The GOAM sees Azerbaijan\'s new push to enforce its 
blockade in the context of other efforts to force Armenia to 
concede in negotiations to end the conflict in 
Nagorno-Karabakh.  During a recent visit to Yerevan, Heikki 
Talvitie, the EU\'s Special Rep for the South Caucasus, told 
us that he saw a new pattern of actions by Azerbaijan to 
isolate Armenia in every way possible, and cited Azerbaijan\'s 
efforts to raise N-K at UNGA as an example. 
14.  (C) However legal Azerbaijan\'s actions to enforce the 
blockade may be and however legitimate -- from its view -- 
its political reasoning is, the economic division of the 
South Caucasus works against our goal of developing regional 
stability.  While we believe it likely would be 
counterproductive (and probably pointless) for outside actors 
to engage any of the players in the current border dispute, 
we believe it would be a blow to efforts to build regional 
ties to support a rail bypass of Armenia.  Encouraging the 
use of existing rail infrastructure through Armenia rather 
than the construction of a new route around could result in a 
small step towards the rapprochement between Turkey and 
Armenia.

1. (C) Minister of Defense Serzh Sargsian requested a

the next steps as the GOAM prepares to deploy a non-combat 
unit to Iraq.  After the Ambassador emphasized the importance 
of approving the deployment without delay, the Minister

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) A recent report sponsored by the UN 
Development Program confirms that Armenia\'s Human 
Rights Ombudsman\'s office suffers from internal 
disorganization and an externally perceived lack of 
independence.  During its first year of operation, the 
ombudsman\'s office has sent mixed messages and achieved 
few concrete results.  The ombudsman accepted the 
report\'s recommended reforms, but may lack the vision 
to enact the suggested changes.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
DISORGANIZATION IN THE OFFICE 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) According to the report\'s author, Dean 
Gottehrer, Armenia\'s Human Rights Ombudsman\'s office 
suffers from internal disorganization.  His comments to 
members of the international community previewed an 
upcoming written report, sponsored by UNDP.  In his 
comments, Gottehrer described office workflow as 
\"circular\" because the ombudsman personally makes all 
major decisions on each complaint.  While the report 
commended the office for its mission statement, it also 
noted that the statement had been created without the 
input of major interest groups.  As a result, the 
office finds itself tossed between the priorities of 
the Government, NGOs, the media, and citizen 
complainants. 
 
--------------- 
UNCLEAR PURPOSE 
--------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Local NGOs have told Post they feel uneasy in 
dealing with the ombudsman\'s office.  They believe the 
office is too closely linked to the executive branch 
because the Armenian president appoints the ombudsman. 
(Note:  The Armenian National Assembly has introduced a 
package of proposed constitutional amendments for a 
2005 referendum which include a provision to transfer 
the power of appointing the ombudsman to the National 
Assembly.  End Note.) 
 
4. (SBU) Post has observed that the ombudsman\'s office 
has sent mixed messages and achieved few concrete 
results during its first year of operation.  We 
welcomed the appointment of the current incumbent, 
Larissa Alaverdian in February 2004 (reftel), but were 
disappointed by her inaction or misdirection on several 
issues during the year.  At our suggestion, the office 
verified the number of detainees held during spring 
political protests, but initiated little further 
action.  At a September meeting with us, Alaverdian had 
difficulty articulating priorities for her office and 
seemed consumed with minor intra-governmental 
squabbles.  After the Jehovah\'s Witnesses were recently 
registered in Armenia, Alaverdian stated publicly that 
she saw herself as a defender of the Armenian public 
against the group\'s door-to-door visits.  (Note:  In a 
separate meeting with President Kocharian\'s top aide, 
we underscored the positive impression the decision to 
register the Jehovah\'s Witnesses had made.  He agreed, 
and added that, despite public pressure, the GOAM would 
not reverse this decision.  End Note.) 
 
----------------------------- 
COMMENT:  OLD HABITS DIE HARD 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Alaverdian has expressed interest in improving 
her office and in Gotteher\'s recommendations in 
particular, including restructuring tasks, seeking 
input from key stakeholder\'s groups, and revising the 
office\'s mission statement.  She immediately went on, 
however, to list what she wants from the GOAM and the 
international community.  She focused on obtaining 
tangible assets such as branch offices and computers 
rather than the internal processes suggested by the 
report.  As in the September meeting with us, she 
seemed to lack a clear sense of priorities and 
emphasized building the Human Rights Ombudsman\'s 
office\'s prestige rather than its capacity.  Despite 
her many good intentions, Alaverdian may lack the 
experience and vision for creating a new, efficient 
institution in Armenia.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  This cable reviews the market for imported 
building materials in Armenia as of December 2004. 
The report describes the market size and U.S. market 
share in Armenia, and lists major market suppliers 
and best sales prospects for U.S. companies.  It 
also includes a list of major importers and key 
contacts in the building products sector.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
MARKET SIZE AND U.S. MARKET SHARE 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  The Armenian market for building materials has 
developed significantly since 2000, driven by 
consistent expansion of the construction sector. 
The construction sector grew by some 50 percent in 
2003, in part supported by humanitarian financing of 
USD 115 million in improvements by the Diaspora U.S.- 
based Lincy Foundation.  According to the National 
Statistical Service of Armenia in January - October 
2004 the volume of construction in Armenia totaled 
approximately USD 363 million, which shows a growth 
of roughly 14 percent compared to the same period in 
2003 which included the Lincy Foundation\'s 
contributions.

3.  Strong demand for new and modern refurbished 
apartments in Yerevan has caused a localized 
expansion in the housing and construction market. 
The city center is undergoing overall renovation and 
reconstruction.  The ambitious Northern Avenue 
project provides for a string of new residential and 
commercial buildings on a street through downtown 
Yerevan.  Two new indoor markets were constructed 
recently in Yerevan.  The Russian-Armenian company, 
International Business Center, is implementing a 
major renovation of Armenia\'s state-owned buildings, 
including the Yerevan Mayor\'s office, now one of the 
largest Government buildings. 
 
4.  Although no published statistics are available 
on the market size for imported building materials, 
the country\'s largest importers estimate that the 
size of the domestic market is more than USD 120 
million annually.  According to their assessments, 
imported finishing materials (i.e., paints, filling, 
varnishes, fixtures, etc.) account for half of the 
market.  Basic materials such as wood, glass, and 
metals account for the other half and come mostly 
from Russia and Ukraine. 
 
5.  According to the industry leaders, the market 
for building materials is dominated by medium-price, 
medium-quality products imported from Turkey, Iran, 
and the United Arab Emirates.  The mid-range goods 
are used primarily in government buildings, 
hospitals, and low-to-medium end commercial shopping 
centers. 
 
6.  The demand for higher quality German, Italian, 
Spanish and other European products is driven by new 
construction and renovation of private hotels, 
restaurants, banks, offices of large companies, 
embassies and other foreign representations, local 
private households as well as newly constructed 
elite residential buildings. 
 
7.  The share of American products in the market is 
small.  It includes the following brands:  Duron, 
Pro, Zar (paints), Laticrete (insulation materials, 
including construction glue).  Despite high 
transport costs (U.S. to Armenia costs USD 4,500 - 
5,000 per 40 ft container) and a long shipping 
duration (45-50 days) American products have a small 
but steady position in the market for higher quality 
finishing products.  Local interest in purchasing 
American construction materials is likely to grow as 
the recent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against 
the Euro and the Armenian Dram have made American 
products more competitive. 
 
---------------------- 
MAJOR MARKET SUPPLIERS 
---------------------- 
 
8.  Armenia has 5-7 large building materials 
importers that make up the majority of domestic 
wholesale suppliers.  According to major importers 
and wholesalers, the country\'s distribution network 
consists of 20-30 large stores and warehouses, 60-70 
medium-sized retail stores, and approximately 200- 
300 small-sized retail stores. 
 
9.  Imex Group (Keramika brand), with annual sales 
of about USD 20 million, is one of Armenia\'s largest 
importers of ceramic fixtures.  Its products include 
bathroom fixtures, sinks, water heaters, 
accessories, and wall decoration.  Imex Group has 
distributorship agreements with a number of leading 
European companies, including Ideal Standard 
(European version of American Standard), Villeroy 
and Boch, Jacuzzi, Duravit, Grohe, Inda, and others. 
In 2004 Imex Group opened a new chain of stores in 
Yerevan under the name of \"Ideal.\" 
 
10.  R and V Comfort is one of Armenia\'s largest 
wholesalers of building and finishing materials. 
The company specializes in inexpensive imported 
ceramic products and other building and finishing 
materials from Turkey, Iran, and the United Arab 
Emirates.  The company also sells high quality 
ceramic tiles and sanitary fixtures from Italy and 
Spain as well as metals from Ukraine.  R and V is an 
official distributor of the American company 
Laticrete, a maker of high quality insulation 
materials and construction glue.  The company 
operates 6 stores and a large warehouse in Yerevan. 
The company\'s annual sales in 2003 were USD 12 
million. 
 
11.  Yerevan-based Metex LLC owns and operates a 
large wholesale trade center.  It specializes in the 
import and distribution of construction metals in 
Armenia.  The company has dealership agreements with

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Russian energy giant RAO-UES is moving to take over 
Armenia\'s sole electricity distributor, Electricity Networks 
of Armenia (ElNetArm), which would consolidate its hold on 
Armenia\'s energy infrastructure.  The director of ElNetArm 
and officials in the Government of Armenia have acknowledged 
the possibility of a sale to RAO-UES and at the same time 
expressed reservations about a sale to any Russian company, 
and especially to RAO-UES, on the grounds that it will lead 
to Russian vertical domination of the Armenian power sector. 
RAO-UES already controls 80 percent of Armenia\'s power 
generation capacity and the distribution network in Armenia\'s 
main export market, Georgia.  Iosif Isayan, Deputy Minister 
of Energy, told us that the Minister of Energy opposes the 
deal and will consider ways to block it.  The Minister of 
Justice told us he thought the deal was \"dangerous\" and would 
create a system that is \"impossible to regulate.\"  Apart from 
concerns about market regulation, consolidated Russian 
control of distribution is a step backwards from Armenia\'s 
stated energy policy goal of reducing Russia\'s control over 
its energy infrastructure.  End Summary. 
 
----------------- 
ElNetArm FOR SALE 
----------------- 
 
2. (C) Yevgeniy Gladunchik, ElNetArm\'s Director General, told 
PA Consulting, a USAID implementer in the energy sector, (and 
a member of ElNetArm\'s staff confirmed to us) that 
ElNetArm,s owners were looking to sell the distribution 
company as soon as possible.  Gladunchik was called to Moscow 
to meet with the owners, who were visiting a steel factory 
they own there.  (Note:  ElNetArm is owned by Midland 
Resources, an offshore British company whose primarily 
shareholder is Ukrainian oligarch Eduard Shifrin (ref B). 
Armenian oligarch and National Assembly Member Harutiun 
Pambukian is also a stakeholder in Midland.  End Note.) 
Gladunchik was told to provide the 2004 financial statement 
of the company as soon as possible so that they could offer 
the company for sale.  They intend to sell the company in 
order to free up assets for another acquisition.  According 
to Gladunchik, Midland Resources hopes to get USD 100 million 
for the company. 
 
------------- 
RUSSIA BUYING 
------------- 
 
3. (C) According to Gladunchik, three firms have expressed an 
interest in purchasing ElNetArm:  RAO-UES, Energotech Export, 
and another, unnamed Russian firm.  In a December 15 meeting, 
Minister of Justice David Harutyunian volunteered that there 
has been discussion about RAO-UES buying the company, 
although he (correctly) emphasized that this was a private 
commercial deal and that the governement was not involved 
except to approve or disapprove of the deal once it had been 
formally offered.  In a December 16 meeting with the 
Ambassador, AmCit Director of the Diaspora Armenia Cafesjian 
Foundation, John Waters, told us that he had approached 
Midland stakeholder and National Assembly member Harutiun 
Pambukian to try and buy the company in an effort to block 
further Russian domination of the energy sector.  Waters told 
us that Midland Resources and RAO-UES were planning to sign a 
letter of Intent to Sell in the \"very near future.\" 
Publicly, both RAO-UES and ElNetArm have recently denied 
press reports about an imminent sale following the November 
30 meeting of RAO-UES Management Board Chairman Alexander 
Voloshin with President Kocharian and Gladunchik. 
 
4. (U) RAO-UES\'s acquisition of the distribution network 
would leave only two major energy assets outside of RAO-UES\'s 
control, the Vorotan Cascade Hydro-Power Plant (controlled by 
the Armenian government) and the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant. 
 In the last two years, RAO-UES took financial control of the 
Armenia Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP), five hydro-electric power 
plants in the Sevan-Hrazdan Cascade, and the Hrazdan thermal 
power plant (ref A).  RAO-UES controls 80 percent of 
Armenia\'s electricity generation capacity, as well as the 
distributor in Armenia\'s single paying export market, 
Georgia.  In addition, Russian state-controlled firm Gazprom 
owns a majority share of ArmRosGazprom, which controls the 
delivery of all piped natural gas in Armenia, and Russian 
firms control the supply of the nuclear fuel for the Armenia 
Nuclear Power Plant. 
 
---------------------------- 
REGULATORY APPROVAL REQUIRED 
---------------------------- 
5. (SBU) Acquisition of the distribution company requires the 
approval of the Public Services Regulatory Commission (PSRC). 
 In a December 15 meeting, Minister of Justice David 
Harutyunian (who struck the original privatization deal with 
Midland Resources) volunteered that he knew about the 
proposed sale to RAO-UES, but that he was \"not sure\" if there 
would be a deal, and that a sale to RAO-UES would be 
\"dangerous\" because they would be difficult to regulate as 
both distributor and generator.  He added that the deal he 
had struck with Midland Resources two years ago had many 
\"poison pills\" in it that, in effect, required the approval 
of the GOAM to sell the company.  Iosif Isayan, Deputy 
Minister of Energy, told us the Minister of Energy was 
concerned about the sale and that the Ministry was 
considering how to block it.  (Note:  The original sale to 
Midland Resources was not transparent.  Midland\'s 
stakeholders are well connected in Armenia and Russia and may 
be able to influence government officials (ref C).  End 
Note.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
AMERICAN DIASPORA GROUP INTERESTED 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The Cafesjian Foundation, owned by AmCit Diaspora 
Armenian Gerard Cafesjian, is seeking to bid on ElNetArm in 
order to avoid Russian domination of the energy sector.  In a 
December 16 meeting with the Ambassador, Cafesjian\'s new 
director John Waters told the Ambassador that he was looking 
for partners to participate in the bid, but that Cafesjian 
could, if necessary, finance an investment of USD 75 to 100 
million himself.  Waters said that he had approached Richard 
Stanaro of EBRD, who said that EBRD would be willing to 
participate and put up 35 percent.  Cafesjian bid on ElNetArm 
three years ago with financing from EBRD, but the GOAM 
ultimately rejected their bid in favor of Midland Resources. 
Waters told us that he was trying to get the deal together 
very quickly, as he understood that RAO-UES and the 
government of Armenia are to sign a letter of Intent to Sell 
very soon.  Comment:  American investment in ElNetArm would 
be an important step towards Armenia\'s goal of reducing its 
energy dependence on Russia.  Cafesjian is likely the best 
candidate for the job, because he is policy minded and can 
afford to suffer some financial loss (although ElNetArm was 
officially Armenia\'s most profitable company in 2004). 
Nevertheless, Midland Resources is a private company, so 
there is no place for our advocacy on Cafesjian\'s behalf. 
End comment. 
 
----------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  SLOUCHING TOWARDS MOSCOW? 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Russian firm RAO-UES currently dominates Armenia\'s 
electricity generation capacity:  Armenia should have a 
strong interest in keeping Russian firms, especially RAO-UES, 
out of its distribution network.  If RAO-UES is successful in 
its bid to buy ElNetArm, a single company will serve as the 
primary generator, sole distributor (and, therefore, 
exporter) and foreign client of Armenian electricity.  It 
would be a difficult regulatory task to prevent the export of 
Armenia\'s cheapest electricity at market prices while 
charging Armenian consumers tariffs for more expensive 
generation.  Besides this market concern, further Russian 
control goes against the Government of Armenia\'s stated 
energy policy of freeing itself from heavy energy dependence 
on a single state or actor.  While the Government has no 
legal authority to demand how a purchaser is selected, it 
does have the authority to approve or disapprove the 
purchase.  The approval of a sale to RAO-UES would be hard to 
explain in terms of Armenia\'s interest in its energy market 
or its concerns about energy dependence.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Armenian parliamentary opposition members 
participated in the December 24 National Assembly 
debates over the dispatch of non-combat troops to Iraq, 
ending their months-long boycott of the sessions of the 
parliament.  Opposition parties, however, were divided 
on the decision:  while the Justice Bloc strongly 
opposed sending GOAM troops to Iraq, members of the 
National Accord faction voted in favor.  It is still 
too early to say whether the opposition\'s boycott is 
really completely over.  One of the most vocal 
opposition members, MP Viktor Dallakian, announced that 
the opposition only participated in the session due to 
the implications of the decision to dispatch troops to 
Iraq for the country and the Armenian Diaspora and said 
that the opposition would continue to boycott the 
parliament.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
OPPOSITION ENGAGES IN NA SESSION 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The December 24 extraordinary session of the 
National Assembly (NA) was unusually long and well 
attended since the opposition had chosen to suspend 
their months-long boycott of the parliamentary sessions 
and engage in the debates over dispatching non-combat 
Armenian troops to Iraq.  Closed-door parliamentary 
debates continued for more than seven hours, and the 
vote was technically secret.  Opposition parties, 
however, split on the decision:  members of the 
National Accord (NA) parliamentary faction voted for 
the dispatch, while MPs from the Justice bloc opposed 
the decision. 
 
3. (SBU) MPs from the Justice bloc promptly left the 
session hall immediately after the vote.  Opposition MP 
Artashes Geghamian, along with six other deputies from 
the National Accord faction, however, stayed for the 
budget debates and even delivered an emotional speech 
on possible return of Soviet-era savings\' deposits to 
the population.  Opposition members stated several 
times that their \"second coming\" to the National 
Assembly was explained only by the utmost importance 
for the country and the Armenian Diaspora of the 
decision to dispatch a non-combat contingent to Iraq; 
they said that they would continue to boycott the 
parliament.  Nevertheless, the word in Yerevan is that 
this move may well indicate the final chapter of a 
boycott that the opposition has been looking for a face- 
saving way to end.  We predict that the opposition will 
engage -- at least part-time -- in the upcoming spring 
legislative session as it considers electoral and 
constitutional reform.

1. (SBU) On December 24, the Armenian National Assembly 
voted to authorize sending a non-combat contingent to 
Iraq.  This clears the way for deployment of the 
approximately 50-man GOAM contingent of drivers, 
sappers, and medics to Iraq in early to mid-January. 
The resolution ratifies an agreement signed by 
President Kocharian on September 6, committing Armenian 
personnel to work with the Polish contingent already in 
Iraq (reftel).  Opposition parties who boycotted the 
National Assembly during most of 2004 returned and 
largely voted against the deployment.  Most of the pro- 
government coalition (with the exception of the 
Dashnaks) and non-aligned members, however, voted for 
the resolution, and it easily cleared the National 
Assembly by a vote of 91 for to 23 against, with one 
abstention.

2. (SBU) National Assembly senior staff told us that the 
GOAM is pushing to ratify the revised \"Article 98\" 
agreement, but that it will not come up for a vote before 
the Spring session (i.e., at the earliest in late February). 
With the GOAM focused on (successfully) securing National 
Assembly authorization for their Iraq contingent in the 
final extraordinary session of the year, the timeline for 
the revised \"Article 98\" agreement slipped.  Nonetheless, 
the National Assembly anticipates no difficulties and 
expects to ratify the agreement during the Spring 2005

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2. (U) The Armenian National Assembly (NA) adopted the Law 
on Fighting Legalization of Illegally Received Income and 
Terrorist Financing.  The new law calls on the Central Bank 
of Armenia to coordinate anti-money laundering and terrorist 
financing activities in Armenia and defines the legal 
grounds for fighting illegal financial transactions, 
identifying and reporting on involved entities and creating 
a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).  The Central Bank is 
responsible for developing the law\'s regulatory and 
enforcement framework.  The GOAM notes that adopting the law 
places Armenia in compliance with international anti-money 
laundering and terrorist financing initiatives including the 
Money Val Committee of the Council of Europe and the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  End Summary 
 
-------------------------------- 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTS THE LAW 
-------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The Armenian National Assembly (NA) voted to adopt 
the Law on Fighting Legalization of Illegally Received 
Income and Terrorist Financing on December 14 and submitted 
it to President Kocharian for signature on December 22.  The 
law will take effect roughly two months after the president 
signs it.  The Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) drafted the law 
as part of an Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing 
package to fulfill Armenia\'s obligation under the 
International Convention on the Suppression of the Financing 
of Terrorism, UN Security Council Resolution No. 1373 
(2001).  (Note:  The National Assembly ratified the 
convention early this year.  End Note.)  In addition to the 
new law, the CBA\'s comprehensive package includes amendments 
to 12 existing laws and the Criminal Code, affecting 
banking, credit and non-profit organizations, insurance, and 
gaming. 
 
---------------------------- 
CBA SETS THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The new law assigns the Central Bank of Armenia as 
the single authorized body to coordinate anti-money 
laundering and to battle terrorist financing activities in 
the country.  The CBA is working to develop a series of 
implementing regulations (aiming to have them take effect by 
June 2005) and plans to set up a Financial Intelligence Unit 
(FIU) by March 2005.  The implementing regulations include 
the charter regulating CBA activities and define the mandate 
of the CBA, FIU, other reporting entities and the 
relationships among them. 
 
----------------------------------- 
LAW DEFINES A \"DUBIOUS TRANSACTION\" 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) The new law lays out criteria that trigger a 
reporting requirement under suspicion of money 
laundering/terrorist financing.  Financial institutions must 
report any non real-estate transaction of more than 20 
million dram (about USD 40,000), real-estate transactions of 
more than 50 million dram (about USD 100,000) as well as any 
money transfer of more than 5 million dram (about USD 
10,000).  The law also requires state registration 
authorities to report any business purchase exceeding 30 
million dram (USD 60,000) in a sole proprietorship company 
and 40 million dram (about USD 80,000) for other types of 
companies. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) This legislation brings Armenia into technical 
compliance with its obligations under the International 
Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 
UN Security Council Resolution No. 1373 (2001); the 
effectiveness of the implementing regulations have yet to be 
seen.

1.  This cable summarizes press reporting on commercial 
developments in Armenia for December 2004.  Major 
headlines include: 
 
-- Armenia sells Zangezur Copper Molybdenum Plant for 
USD 132 million; 
 
-- EBRD buys shares in Armenian commercial bank; 
 
-- IMF approves USD 13.7 million for Armenia;

ARMENIA SELLS ZANGEZUR COPPER MOLYBDENUM PLANT FOR USD 
132 MILLION 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2.  Armenia\'s largest mining complex, the Zangezur 
Copper Molybdenum Plant, has been sold to a group of 
private investors led by the German company Chronimet. 
According to the Armenian Ministry of Trade and 
Economic Development, Chronimet acquired a 60 percent 
stake in the plant for USD 132 million and would 
control another 15 percent through the Yerevan-based 
smelter Pure Iron where it holds a controlling stake. 
Two other shareholders, each getting 12.5 percent, are 
Armenian companies Armenian Molybdenum Production and 
Zangezur Mining.  The new owners, supported by Western 
banks, including Deutsche Bank, plan to invest USD 150 
million in modernization of the plant within the next 
four years. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
EBRD BUYS SHARES IN ARMENIAN COMMERCIAL BANK 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) and Armeconombank signed a deal in 
which EBRD would pay USD 1.2 million for a \"25 percent 
plus one\" share in Yerevan-based Armeconombank.  This 
is the first time the EBRD would become a shareholder 
of an Armenian commercial bank.  According to the local 
EBRD representative the bank would assist in the 
strategic management of Armeconombank and would provide 
technical assistance of 500,000 Euros to make the bank 
more reliable and introduce risk management systems. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
IMF APPROVES USD 13.7 MILLION FOR ARMENIA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved 
a USD 13.7 million disbursement to Armenia completing a 
three-year lending program designed to sustain 
macroeconomic stability in Armenia.  It was the sixth 
tranche of the USD 105.3 million Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Facility (PRDF) arrangement.  PRDF funds have 
been used since May 2001 by the Armenian Central Bank 
to maintain a stable exchange rate of the national 
currency and to alleviate the country\'s negative 
balance of payments.  IMF officials said the program 
has served its purpose.  According to Armenia\'s 
Minister of Finance and Economy Armenia will implement 
another three-year program with the IMF. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
SLOVAKIAN COMPANY TO LAUNCH THE VANADZOR CHEMICAL 
PLANT IN ARMENIA 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5.  The Slovakian company, SLZ, part of Sweden\'s 
Dividend Group, is planning to invest USD 1.5 million 
in the Vanadzor Chemical Plant in Armenia.  The 
Armenian Ministry of Trade and Economic Development 
announced that SLZ would launch the plant by February 
15, 2005.  Within the upcoming 6-8 months SLZ would 
sign an agreement with the owner of the plant for trust 
management or lease of the facility.  The current owner 
of the plant is Russia\'s Zakneftegazstroy-Prometey. 
The Russian company privatized the plant in 1999 and 
has invested up to USD 20 million in the enterprise, 
which has stood idle since 2002.  The Slovakian company 
was reportedly seeking at least a 51 percent stake in 
the Vanadzor Chemical Plant.

ARMENIA REPORTS 10 PERCENT GDP GROWTH IN JANUARY - 
NOVEMBER, 2004 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
6.  Armenia\'s National Statistical Service reported 10 
percent GDP growth for January to November, 2004.  By 
the end of November, 2004 the GDP totaled 1,672 billion 
dram (USD 3.1 billion).  From January to November, 2004 
the volume of industrial production increased by 1.6 
percent compared with the same period in 2003, or 473.9 
billion dram (USD 881.4 million).  The volume of 
agricultural output totaled 412.5 billion dram (USD 
767.1 million) from January to November, 2004, 
increasing by 14.3 percent as compared to the same 
period in 2003.

Ministry of Justice can now adjudicate the roughly 20 
applications received from Fall 2004 draftees.  The 
ministry expects to complete the adjudication process 
in early February, before spring military training 
begins.  Under the law, draftees can apply for civil 
service such as work in a hospital or alternative 
military service, which excludes handling weapons. 
Applicants must show that they are members of an 
established pacifist group in order to qualify for one 
of the alternatives to military service.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The Armenian National Assembly adopted 
legislation December 14 that creates a potentially 
powerful Chamber of Advocates for criminal defense 
lawyers and seeks to improve the state-funded public 
defender\'s program.  Local legal assistance groups 
believe the changes may help level the playing field in 
a court system that often favors the prosecution.  The 
legislation attempts to rectify deficiencies in defense 
lawyers\' qualifications, organization, training, 
ethics, and funding.  While the new organization has 
not begun to take shape, the law describes institutions 
likely to improve criminal defense lawyers\' abilities 
to advocate for their clients.  We intend to work with 
this group as it develops.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
CURRENT CRIMINAL DEFENSE 
------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) According to the local representative of the 
American Bar Association\'s Central European and 
Eurasian Law Initiative (ABA/CEELI), criminal defense 
lawyers in Armenia are poorly trained, underpaid, and 
bound only by vague ethical restraints.  As a result, 
they often do not effectively assert their clients\' 
rights and sometimes become a vehicle through which 
defendants try to bribe judges.  The Armenian 
Constitution guarantees every criminal defendant a 
lawyer, but court-appointed attorneys frequently 
collude with the prosecution.  According to ABA/CEELI\'s 
2003 Legal Profession Reform Index for Armenia, 
prosecutors often choose the lawyer who will be their 
opposing counsel, decide which information to give the 
defense, and decide how much to pay the defense lawyer. 
For this reason, indigent Armenians frequently waive 
their right to counsel and defend themselves in 
criminal court. 
 
--------------- 
LAW ON ADVOCACY 
--------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The Law on Advocacy approved by the National 
Assembly December 14 has three main goals: to create a 
unified organization to enforce ethical standards, 
encourage higher standards for the training of 
advocates, and create a public defender\'s program 
controlled by the advocates.  (Note:  In Armenia, the 
term \"advocate\" refers only to lawyers who represent 
criminal defendants in court.  End Note.)  The law 
creates a Chamber of Advocates, which has sole 
authority over testing, licensing, and discipline of 
advocates.  The law codifies ethical concepts such as 
conflict of interest and client privilege, but also 
establishes an ethics committee within the Chamber that 
has the power to elaborate on these basic ethical 
standards.  The law separates the public defender\'s 
office from State control but mandates that the 
government will pay public defenders at the same rate 
as prosecutors.  The law also seeks to secure the 
Chamber\'s independence and objectivity.  The Chamber 
reports to no branch of the government and is almost 
completely supported by member dues.  It is subject to 
a yearly external audit, which will be reported to the 
membership.  The law also establishes due process for 
disciplinary procedures and enumerates the rights of 
individual advocates within the organization. 
 
-------------------- 
NOT OUT OF THE WOODS 
-------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The traditions of Soviet law practice, 
however, still hang over the legal profession in 
Armenia and may endanger the effectiveness of the new 
institution.  Armenian defense attorneys and judges 
have long followed the prosecutor\'s lead in criminal 
cases, and much of the \"old guard\" advocates have found 
this arrangement both comfortable and profitable since 
Armenian independence.  Furthermore single judges still 
decide most Armenian criminal cases and there is no 
guarantee that decisions will change even if defense 
skills dramatically improve.  The law combines two 
previously separate lawyers\' associations, and members 
of the more progressive union, which prides itself on 
protecting civil liberties, fear that more conservative 
members will outvote them in the unified Chamber. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) The new Chamber has the potential to improve 
significantly the abilities of advocates to assert 
their clients\' rights, and even if conservatives were 
to seize control of the Chamber, the law affords many 
opportunities through which dissenters could promote 
human rights.  Significant checks and balances within 
the organization prevent a faction from controlling the 
Chamber, and the law protects individual advocates from 
arbitrary disciplinary procedures.  Progressive 
advocates could use structures within the organization 
to advance their agenda, and as allowed by the law, 
they are currently forming a watchdog NGO to monitor 
civil rights in criminal trials.  The new Chamber could 
be a great force for change, but we will continue to 
monitor if the Chamber lives up to this potential. 
This body, when it is formed, would be a natural 
partner for our assistance programs aimed at building 
Armenia\'s democratic institutions.  We will work with 
this group as it develops.

------------------ 
FACTS DON\'T ADD UP 
------------------ 
 
1. (SBU) On January 6, Forum 18, a Norwegian NGO, reported 
that Armen Grigoryan, an Armenian citizen eligible for 
mandatory military service, had been refused status as a 
conscientious objector, hazed and forced to serve in Nagorno- 
Karabakh against his will.  Post is investigating the claims 
made by Forum 18, which has no representation in Armenia, 
but we cannot substantiate the claims Forum 18 made in its 
report.  A number of discrepencies significantly reduce the 
story\'s credibility:  the named military prosecutor who 
allegedly ordered legal proceedings against Grigoryan, 
Vladik Khachatryan, does not appear to exist.  Military 
sources confirmed that no one by that name works for the 
Armenian military prosecutor or military police.  According 
the local leadership of the Jehovah\'s Witnesses, Grigoryan 
is neither a member of the church nor in the process of 
joining. 
 
2. (SBU) According to Armenia\'s Human Rights Ombudsman 
Larissa Alaverdian who has been following this case of 
alleged abuse, Grigoryan responded to his draft notice in 
May 2004 and requested alternative civilian service.  At 
that time, however, the National Assembly had not yet 
completed implementation of the new law on alternative 
military service, nor had it yet created provisions for 
civilian service (reftel).  In August, Grigoryan refused to 
take an oath of service, and was accused of refusing the 
order of a superior officer.  Shortly thereafter, Grigoryan 
left his unit without leave, and according to Alaverdian, 
Grigoryan\'s father is currently hiding him in Armenia.  The 
Ombudsman\'s office has followed this case since May, but 
they have no record of a complaint by Grigoryan alleging 
abuse in the army as reported by Forum 18. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
3. (SBU) Grigoryan may not qualify as a conscientious 
objector under the new Armenian law because he is not a 
member the Jehovah\'s Witnesses or any other group \"holding 
to a pacifist doctrine.\"  The leader of the Jehovah\'s 
Witnesses in Armenia told us that Armen Grigoryan was not a 
member of their organization nor was he on his way towards 
membership.  The leader also noted that for several years 
the Jehovah\'s Witnesses have advised draftees to surrender 
themselves to police before reporting for military service. 
This procedure establishes the dissenter as a conscientious 
objector rather than a deserter subject to military law. 
Grigoryan\'s failure to follow this procedure further 
illustrates his distance from the Jehovah\'s Witnesses 
(although Grigoryan\'s father is a member of the community, 
Grigoryan himself has not indicated a desire to join the 
church, according to the Jehovah\'s Witnesses\' leadership). 
We will continue to follow this case closely.

Classified By: Amb. John Evans for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary.  Post strongly supports the United State\'s 
joining the Black Sea Economic Council (BSEC) as an observer, 
per ref A.  There could be multiple benefits for the U.S.: 
we focus here on those that intersect with our regional goals 
in the South Caucasus.  Due to Armenia\'s political isolation, 
BSEC is one of the few fora Armenia has where it can build 
economic ties with its neighbors.  Armenia\'s representative 
to BSEC, stationed in Istanbul, is Armenia\'s only diplomatic 
representation in Turkey, despite a large Armenian population 
in Istanbul and significant trade between the countries.  The 
presence of the United States as an observer could help BSEC 
achieve its goal (and our strategic objective) of expanding 
multilateral economic cooperation among its member states. 
Specifically, the U.S. could use its observer status to 
discourage the use of BSEC to isolate Armenia, as has 
happened with GUUAM (an organization comprising Georgia, 
Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova) and as 
Azerbaijan has pushed for in another multilateral forum, 
Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia (TRACECA).  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
BSEC:  A STEP TOWARD TURKISH-ARMENIAN RELATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (SBU) BSEC provides an important forum between Turkey and 
Armenia.  Despite closed borders, Turkey is Armenia\'s seventh 
largest trade partner.  Armenia\'s representative to BSEC in 
Istanbul provides economic diplomatic representation despite 
the lack of formal bilateral relations between the two 
countries.  Paruyr Hovhannisyan, Head of the International 
Economic Organizations Divisions at the MFA who previously 
served in Istanbul\'s BSEC mission, told us that Armenia uses 
the BSEC mission to conduct informal discussions with the 
Government of Turkey on possible changes in the relations 
between the two countries.  For example, the BSEC mission 
negotiated the initiation of the popular flight between 
Istanbul and Yerevan (ref C). 
 
----------------------------- 
ARMENIA INCREASINGLY ISOLATED 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) As Azerbaijan moves to tighten the blockade on 
Armenia (ref B), a multilateral regional forum like BSEC 
could be an important instrument to expand regional trade 
without excluding Armenia.  (Note:  Armenia is conspicuously 
absent from GUUAM, another multilateral regional cooperation 
group.  End Note.)  Armenia is an island in the stream of 
East-West commerce.  The railway that once connected Turkey 
to the Soviet Union now lies unused because it crosses 
Armenia on its way to Tbilisi and Baku.  Goods from the west 
bypass Armenia, instead taking an expensive route through 
Georgia and on to the east.  Goods from the east, which 
necessarily transit Azerbaijan, are prohibited from entering 
Armenia pursuant to agreements between Azerbaijan and 
Georgia.  As a result, Armenia has some of the world\'s 
highest transit tariffs, raising prices on goods and 
hampering the export economy.  This year Azerbaijan has 
pushed Georgia to enforce these transshipment measures more 
strongly, and has appealed to TRACECA to finance a new 
railroad from Kars, Turkey to Tbilisi, Georgia that would 
create an East-West rail connection bypassing Armenia.  In 
this context, Armenia\'s participation in BSEC is an 
important, and often the only, mechanism to keep Armenia 
talking to its neighbors about regional trade and 
cooperation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
COMMENT:  U.S. COULD HELP BSEC ACHIEVE ITS GOALS (AND OURS) 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
4. (C) Azerbaijan\'s efforts to enforce a blockade against 
Armenia and the economic division of the South Caucasus work 
against our goal of developing regional cooperation and 
stability.  BSEC provides an important talking ground for 
otherwise estranged countries, and gives a multilateral push 
towards reaping the benefits of regional cooperation.  We 
should encourage a strong BSEC that moves toward its goal of 
extending multilateral and bilateral ties in the region and 
we should discourage a BSEC that pursues a policy of 
isolating any country, including Armenia.  Our task will be 
easier if we become a member, even an observer.

REF: YEREVAN 19 
 
Classified By: DCM A.F. Godfrey for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) We reported reftel our initial investigation of an 
allegation of religious persecution in Armenia\'s armed 
forces.  On January 11, we spoke with Levon Margaryan, Deputy 
Board Member of the Jehovah\'s Witnesses in Armenia, about the 
recent media claims that Armen Grigoryan was abused while 
serving in the Armenian army.  Margaryan stated that he 
serves as Grigoryan\'s lawyer in the case.  Margaryan 
confirmed that Grigoryan was not a member of the Jehovah\'s 
Witnesses nor was he on the way to becoming a member. 
According to Margaryan, Grigoryan claimed he did not receive 
his draft notice in May 2004.  In June Grigoryan was called 
by a military official and asked to report for a physical 
examination.  (Note:  Unless the Ministry of Defense has 
granted them a deferment, Armenian men are drafted during the 
recruitment cycle immediately after their 18th birthday.  For 
Grigoryan, this would have been May 2004.  Reporting for an 
army physical before receiving a draft notice would be highly 
unusual.  End Note.)  Margaryan reported that Grigoryan 
claimed to be quite suprised when he was taken from the 
doctor\'s office and sent to join recruits in Karabakh. 
According to the lawyer, Grigoryan declared his conscientious 
objection to military service for the first time after 
arriving in Karabakh. 
 
2. (C) Margaryan stated that Grigoryan was not kept under 
guard and not forced to participate in military excercises 
while with the military unit.  During a visit by Margaryan 
and Grigoryan\'s father, the commanding officer allowed 
Grigoryan to leave the base with them for lunch.  According 
to Margaryan, a regional military investigator reported to 
him that he had hit Grigoryan in order to \"bring him up 
right,\" but Margaryan also stated that Grigoryan\'s direct 
supervisor intervened on several occasions to prevent abuse. 
Grigoryan\'s lawyer alleged that when Grigoryan\'s commanding 
officer went on vacation, the abuse increased and Grigoryan 
left his unit without leave.  Grigoryan is currently in 
hiding. 
 
3. (C) Margaryan stated that no Jehovah\'s Witness members 
have been forced into the army in recent memory, but that 
nine remained in prison as conscientious objectors despite 
the newly adopted law on Alternatives to Military Service. 
 
4. (C) This information authoritatively discredits 
allegations made by the Norwegian NGO \"Forum 18.\"  While the 
hazing described in paragraph 2 above is certainly 
objectionable, it is, unfortunately, common for recruits in 
post-Soviet armed forces.

Summary 
------- 
 
2.  (S/NF) On January 11, Armenian Defense Minister Serzh 
Sargsian asked the Ambassador what the U.S. view would be on 
a potential weapons sale to Iran.  Sargsian said that the 
GOAM is under increasing pressure from Iran, which recognizes 
Armenia\'s isolation.  He reiterated Armenia\'s dedication to 
ongoing cooperation with the U.S. to combat terrorism and the 
proliferation of WMD.  The Ambassador responded that the U.S. 
still viewed Iran as the number one state sponsor of 
terrorism.  He thanked Sargsian for approaching the USG 
before it made any decision and said he understood Armenia\'s 
need to tend its relations with Iran.  He agreed to pass on 
the request, but said that Washington\'s view of any transfer 
of weapons to Iran would certainly be negative.  End Summary. 
 
3.  (S/NF) Armenia\'s Defense Minister sought a one-on-one 
meeting with the Ambassador following a January 11 meeting on 
other defense-related issues (septel).  Sargsian told the 
Ambassador that the GOAM had been approached by Iran 
regarding the sale of an anti-air missile system.  Sargsian 
characterized the S-75 system as antiquated, surplus 
equipment and noted that Armenia had just decommissioned a 
couple of them; proceeds from the sale would be welcome as 
the MOD budget is facing shortfalls. (Note: open sources 
state that the S-75 or SA-2 Guideline was converted by Saddam 
Hussein\'s Iraq into a short-range ballistic missile.  End 
Note.)  Sargsian stressed that the system was \"defensive.\" 
 
4.  (S/NF) Sargsian said that Armenia was under increasing 
pressure from Iran to expand relations.  Armenia\'s borders 
with Turkey and Azerbaijan remain closed and Armenia is 
dependent on Iran as a source of imports.  Sargsian explained 
that for an extended period when access to goods via Georgia 
was limited because of unrest, Iran was Armenia\'s lifeline. 
Sargsian said that Iran\'s ambassador in Yerevan sought to 
meet with him almost every two weeks and was stepping up the 
pressure for the MOD to visit Tehran. 
 
5.  (S/NF) Sargsian said that Armenia remained committed to 
working with the USG to combat terrorism and was cooperating 
with the U.S. on the border with Iran to contain the spread 
of WMD.  Armenia will continue to ensure full transparency 
with the U.S. in its relations with Iran. 
 
6.  (S/NF) The Ambassador thanked Sargsian for bringing the 
potential weapons sale to our attention before a deal was 
concluded and agreed to forward it immediately to Washington 
for consideration and response.  But the USG continued to 
consider Iran as the number one state sponsor of terrorism 
and a U.S. approval of a weapons sale to Iran would be 
extremely unlikely. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
7.  (S/NF) Request Department guidance on how to respond to 
Sargsian, including a description of how ILSA would affect 
Armenia should the GOAM decide to proceed with the sale. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (S/NF) While Sargsian\'s approach shows a certain degree 
of naivete or at least unfounded optimism, his readiness to 
vet this sale with us also demonstrates that he values the 
relationship with the USG.  While we anticipate Washington\'s 
negative reaction to this sale, we note that, at present, 
Armenia has little choice but to develop its relationship 
with Iran.  If we approach this relationship with some 
understanding, we should be able to maintain some leverage. 
We want to encourage Armenia to maintain her policy of 
transparency regarding relations with her southern neighbor, 
and would like to forestall her sliding into an even more 
intimate embrace with Tehran.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (S/NF) In deploying troops to the coalition in Iraq and 
agreeing to a defense assessment, Armenia has taken important 
steps in building a broader, deeper defense relationship; 
lack of full compliance with conventional arms control 
regimes would negate that progress.  That was the message the 
Ambassador delivered to Defense Minister Serzh Sargsian on 
January 11 in conjunction with a verbatim delivery of ref A 
talking points.  Sargsian was defensive: declared that the 
cited incidents referred to movements of equipment not 
limited by treaty, complained about Azerbaijan\'s continued 
non-compliance with limits on TLE, and said that the 
dislocation of some TLE is beyond GOAM control (in N-K).  The 
Ambassador pressed back:it is vital for Armenia to avoid even 
the perception of a lack of full compliance.  Sargsian 
appreciated the intent of our message and said Armenia would 
comply fully with its obligations.  End Summary. 
 
Delivering the Message 
---------------------- 
 
2. (S/NF)  On January 11 the Ambassador met with Defense 
Minister Serzh Sargsian to deliver reftel talking points 
regarding Armenia\'s compliance with conventional arms 
inspection regimes.  This message was delivered formally by 
CDA on December 30 to Deputy Foreign Minister Markarian, but 
Markarian gave no substantive reply.  With Sargsian was 
General Mikhael Melkonian, Chief of the MOD\'s Directorate for 
foreign relations and Colonel Haik Kotanjian, advisor to the 
Minister.  DCM and DATT accompanied the Ambassador. 
 
3. (S/NF)  The Ambassador prefaced his delivery of reftel 
points by outlining what is at stake: Armenia had taken 
significant steps to both broaden and deepen the defense 
relationship with the U.S.  The decision and subsequent 
parliamentary approval of a deployment of troops to join the 
coalition in Iraq, together with Sargsian\'s agreement to host 
a Defense Assessment were significant.  The change in how 
Armenia is perceived as a contributing partner is at serious 
risk if Armenia is judged to be out of full compliance with 
all relevant arms inspection regimes. 
 
4. (S/NF) Sargsian\'s first reaction was defensive.  He 
attributed movement of military equipment to routine training 
requirements, planned long in advance.  He said that since 
the training area for the regiment in Goris is located near 
Sisian, combat equipment must be frequently moved.  He added 
that the MOD may on occasion reassign equipment to different 
units without fully coordinating within the various 
departments of the MOD so that proper notification can be 
made in Vienna.  He noted that all of the 91 MTLBs that the 
MOD possesses are equipped as military ambulances and invited 
DCM and DATT to visit one of the units that have these 
vehicles.  He also offered to provide a complete list of 
units with MTLB ambulances.  At times Sargsyan seemed not to 
understand that the arms control agreements demand 
transparency in order to build confidence. 
 
5. (S/NF)  Sargsyan expressed concern that the U.S. was 
worried about relatively minor Armenian compliance issues, 
while the real threat to stability in the region was 
Azerbaijan\'s intention to take Nagorno-Karabakh by force.  He 
claimed that Azerbaijan received three times as much military 
equipment from the USSR than did Armenia and has subsequently 
purchased additional equipment from Ukraine, putting 
Azerbaijan over its CFE limits.  He emphasized that the 
military balance between the two countries must be 
maintained. 
 
6. (S/NF) Sargsyan concluded by saying that Armenia would do 
everything necessary to fully comply with the CFE Treaty and 
Vienna Document and he did not want arms control compliance 
concerns to interfere with the developing bilateral military 
relationship.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Armenia\'s President Robert Kocharian has publicly 
said that 2005 will be a year of reform for the customs and 
tax services in Armenia.  Besides increasing tax revenues, 
Kocharian called on the revenue services to \"act legally\" 
and not to create \"privileged conditions for anybody.\"  In 
these words Kocharian acknowledged the dominant concern of 
the Armenian economy and perhaps the heaviest burden on 
small and medium enterprise development.  Armenia\'s revenue 
services systematically either fail to tax or undertax 
Armenia\'s oligarchs, and systematically overtax medium-sized 
and foreign firms to compensate.  Besides limiting tax 
revenues, this has created virtual monopolies for favored 
oligarchs in various basic sectors where competition should 
be stronger.  Reform of the revenue services will damage 
entrenched interests of powerful people, and will require 
political will at the highest levels of Armenian government. 
End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
KOCHARIAN SAYING THE RIGHT THINGS 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) In his January 11 address to the State Customs 
Committee, Kocharian clearly laid out the problem of 
corruption in the revenue services, echoing what the 
international business community, the International Monetary 
Fund and we have been saying for years.  Along with 
addressing the longer-term task of increasing revenue, 
Kocharian acknowledged corruption and nepotism in the 
customs service, and said that it must change to treat all 
businesses \"equally and fairly.\"  \"I am sure that if you 
start from yourself, from taxing your friends and relatives, 
you will not let others escape taxation either,\" Kocharian 
said, according to his own press office web site, \"We cannot 
forbid your friends from doing business.  We encourage free 
enterprise.  What we don\'t encourage is the creation of 
privileged conditions for anybody.\"  Kocharian made a 
similar address to the tax service officials the next day, 
saying, \"There are enterprises which have not been inspected 
for years and those which are inspected several times every 
year.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
TAX AND CUSTOMS: TOOLS OF THE OLIGARCHS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The tax and customs services have long been tools 
of the oligarchs.  Rather than following Armenian law and 
WTO procedures on customs valuation, the customs service has 
used different valuations for different importers, often 
resulting in a laughably low tariff burden for favored 
importers and a prohibitively high tariff burden for new 
market entrants (reftel).  The result has been virtual 
monopolies on the import of several basic goods such as 
wheat, sugar, tobacco, salt, beer, gasoline, for which there 
is no economic justification for a natural monopoly or lack 
of competition. 
 
5. (SBU) Similarly, the tax service has failed to enforce 
tax provision against some of Armenia\'s largest businesses. 
Kotayk Beer, owned by Armenia\'s most ostentatious oligarch 
and Deputy of Parliament Gagik Tsarukian (aka Dodi Gago) is 
indisputably Armenia\'s largest beer company.  Nevertheless, 
it does not appear on the list of Armenia\'s large taxpayers 
despite the fact that Kilikia, its weaker competitor is one 
of the top ten taxpayers.  Small and medium-sized 
enterprises, on the other hand, complain of overtaxation. 
Members of the Yerevan American Chamber of Commerce complain 
of harassing and unjustifiable tax inspections, illegal 
demands for prepayment of tax liability, and the failure of 
the Armenian government to refund tax overpayments for 
several years. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
CONSTANT PRESSURE OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Corruption in the tax and customs services has come 
under increasing pressure from the international donor 
community in the past two years.  The American Chamber of 
Commerce has raised it to the Prime Minister, the chair of 
the High Business Council.  The IMF has made tax and customs 
reforms conditionalities in its reviews of Armenia\'s PRGF 
arrangement, and we have raised concerns about tax and 
customs consistently at the US-Armenia Task Force (USATF). 
7. (SBU) Speaking about the possibility of a new Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, IMF 
resident representative James McHugh told us that the 
government has completed all the reforms that are 
politically easy to complete.  (Note:  The last tranche of 
the last PRGF arrangement was disbursed in November 2004. 
End Note.)  \"The question we are asking them now is,\" said 
McHugh, \"are they willing to tax rich people.\"  The 
international community has constantly emphasized the need 
for reform of the tax and customs administration in order to 
create a competitive business environment and to increase 
overall tax revenues, which is necessary to meet the social 
demands called for in Armenia\'s Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Paper.  (Note:  At 15 percent of GDP, Armenia\'s tax base is 
the lowest in the CIS.  End Note.) 
 
8. (SBU) In a November letter to the IMF asking for a follow- 
on PRGF arrangement, the Minister of Finance and the Prime 
Minister promised reforms of the two revenue services, 
specifically promising to bring them under the control of 
the Minister of Finance.  To move revenue collection and 
expenditure under the same roof could be a boon for the 
Armenian economy, but it will take the support of Armenia\'s 
highest officials to effect. 
 
------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  EASIER SAID THAN DONE 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) We welcome President Kocharian\'s comments about 
reforms in the tax and customs service, but are skeptical of 
the President\'s will and, even, ability to push them 
through.  Reform of these two agencies will require breaking 
down entrenched interests in nepotism and corruption, and 
replacing powerful officials who have close ties to the 
President and Minister of Defense.  Although some GOAM 
officials recognize the need for reform, we don\'t think that 
they have the power to change the leadership or practices of 
the powerful revenue services.  In the past, our demands 
(and those of other donors) for reforms in the revenue 
services have been received positively by the Minister of 
Finance, but shrugged off by the heads of tax and customs. 
At the May 2004 USATF in Yerevan, the point about illegal 
customs valuation created a publicly awkward moment between 
Armenia\'s Minister of Finance and General Avetissian, the 
Head of the Customs Service, where the General suggested 
that he does not report to the Minister.  Now that Kocharian 
has stated the problem and the direction of reform, what 
progress he makes will be a test of Armenia\'s political will 
to move from familiar ways of nepotism and corruption to a 
true market economy.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (U) The GOAM announced January 11 that President Robert 
Kocharian sent a congratulatory message to Ukrainian 
President-elect Viktor Yushchenko.  The news sparked a flurry 
of media reports about Armenia-Ukraine-Russia relations and 
re-ignited discussion on the applicability of recent events 
in Ukraine and Georgia in the current Armenian political 
theater.  The congratulatory letter was reportedly almost 
identical to the message Kocharian had sent to Ukrainian 
Prime Minister Victor Yanukovich following the November 21 
round of voting.  Reports were quick to remind that the GOAM 
was the only Council of Europe country, other than Russia, to 
have recognized Yanukovich as the victor in the November 2004 
election.  GOAM officials once again defended Kocharian on 
his handling of the issue, saying the decision to recognize 
Yanukovich relied on cues of Ukraine\'s Central Election 
Commission and denied that the move was simply an attempt to 
please Moscow by supporting the pro-Russia candidate.  End 
summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
SAME LETTER, DIFFERENT ADDRESSEE 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) The GOAM announced January 11 that President Robert 
Kocharian sent a congratulatory message to Ukrainian 
President-elect Viktor Yushchenko.  The text of the letter 
included standard language and a call for strengthening of 
relations between the two countries.  Most of the Armenia\'s 
press smirkingly noted that the congratulatory letter was 
almost identical to the message Kocharian had sent to 
Ukrainian Prime Minister Victor Yanukovich following the 
November 21 round of voting. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
KOCHARIAN - HEEDING THE CEC OR CUES FROM MOSCOW? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. (C) News reports seized on the latest Kocharian letter as 
an opportunity to remind the public that the GOAM was the 
only Council of Europe country, other than Russia, to have 
recognized Yanukovich as the victor of the November 2004 
election.  Opposition newspapers again suggested that 
Kocharian\'s decision to recognize Yushchenko was a move to 
please official Moscow by quickly supporting the pro-Russia 
candidate.  GOAM officials once again defended Kocharian, 
however, saying his November decision was based on 
information received from Ukraine\'s Central Election 
Commission and not a political move.  (Note:  GOAM insiders 
told us that Kocharian\'s rush to congratulate Yanukovich was 
prompted by an urgent personal appeal from Russia\'s former 
Prime Minister and Ambassador in Kiev, Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
End Note.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
COMMENT:  YEREVAN IS STILL NO KIEV 
---------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) The news of Kocharian\'s congratulations of Yushchenko 
sparked a flurry of media reports about 
Armenia-Ukraine-Russia relations and re-ignited discussion on 
the applicability of recent events in Ukraine and Georgia in 
the current Armenian political theater.  Local commentators 
(and some media outlets abroad) are quick to draw parallels 
between recent events in Ukraine and Georgia and the 
political environment in Armenia.  But Yerevan is neither 
Tbilisi nor Kiev, and drastic political change is unlikely in 
the near future.  While Armenian opposition leaders like to 
think that the public is still outraged over electoral fraud 
during Armenia\'s 2003 presidential and parliamentary 
elections, the mood is nowhere near as electric as it was 
immediately following the election or during the much-touted 
\"Hot Spring\" rallies of April 2004.  The key difference 
remains the absence of a single opposition leader with enough 
charisma, popular support or an easy-to-understand agenda to 
unite party leaders in opposing the current government.
