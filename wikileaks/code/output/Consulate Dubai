SUBJECT:  POPULAR IRANIAN VIEWS OF TEHRAN\'S POLICY 
          TOWARD ISRAEL (RESPONSE TO C-NA1-01033) 
 
REF:  A) DUBAI 1058 28 AUG 01 B) DUBAI 1197 08 NOV 00 
C) DUBAI 1254 10 NOV 00 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY PRINCIPAL OFFICER RICHARD OLSON FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY.  IRANIAN VISA APPLICANTS, DUBAI-BASED 
TRADERS, AND IRANIANS RESIDENT IN DUBAI PROVIDED THEIR 
ASSESSMENT OF IRAN\'S POLICY TOWARD ISRAEL AND THE 
PALESTINIAN CONFLICT.  OF THOSE WHO EXPRESSED OPINIONS-- 
MANY IRANIANS WHOM CONOFF APPROACHED CLAIMED THAT THEY 
EITHER DID NOT HAVE AN OPINION OR DID NOT INVOLVE 
THEMSELVES IN POLITICS--IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS A 
DISCONNECT TO SOME DEGREE BETWEEN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT\'S 
STRIDENT PUBLIC SUPPORT OF THE PALESTINIANS AND 
CORRESPONDING VITRIOL TOWARDS ISRAEL AND THE PRIVATE VIEWS 
HELD BY THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION.  WHILE IT APPEARS 
THAT MANY IRANIANS SYMPATHIZE WITH THE HUMANITARIAN PLIGHT 
OF THE PALESTINIANS, GIVEN IRAN\'S DOMESTIC ECONOMIC 
DIFFICULTIES THEY QUESTION WHY IRAN IS OUT IN FRONT OF EVEN 
THE ARABS, DEVOTING SCARCE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO FIGHTING 
\'THE ARABS\' FIGHT\'.  SOME INTERVIEWEES REPORT THAT TEHRAN 
IS EXPLOITING THE ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT FOR DOMESTIC 
POLITICAL REASONS, WHILE OTHERS EVEN PROFESSED PRO-ISRAEL 
SENTIMENT.  ALL, HOWEVER, CAUTIONED ABOUT THE DANGER OF 
EXPRESSING THESE TYPES OF VIEWS OPENLY, EVEN TO OTHER 
IRANIANS.  OF THE FEW IRANIANS INTERVIEWED WHO APPEARED TO 
BE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF TEHRAN\'S POLICIES, COUNTERBALANCING 
US INFLUENCE IN THE REGION WAS SEEN TO BE A MOTIVATOR FOR 
THE REGIME\'S ACTIVITIES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
A DIFFICULT ISSUE TO DISCUSS 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) IN LATE AUGUST/EARLY SEPTEMBER DISCUSSIONS WITH 
CONOFF MANY IRANIANS SHIED AWAY FROM OFFERING THEIR 
OPINIONS OF IRAN\'S POLICY VIS A VIS THE ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN 
CONFLICT.  CLAIMING EITHER TO BE APOLITICAL OR AFRAID TO 
DISCUSS THE ISSUE, EVEN RELATIVELY BENIGN QUESTIONS SUCH AS 
\"WHAT IS IRAN\'S FOREIGN POLICY TOWARD THE CONFLICT\" WENT 
UNANSWERED.  APPARENTLY SPEAKING TO AN AMERICAN OFFICIAL 
WAS NOT THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM; AS ONE 45-YEAR OLD 
BUSINESSMAN EXPLAINED \"IT IS TOO DANGEROUS TO TALK 
ABOUT THE SUBJECT EVEN AMONG IRANIANS.\"  (REF DUBAI 1058 
DATED 28 AUGUST 01 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT 
INCREASING IRANIAN HESITANCE TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION ABOUT 
A NUMBER OF POLITICAL ISSUES.)  IN THWARTING DISCUSSION OF 
THE ISSUE MANY PROFESSED TO CONCERN THEMSELVES ONLY WITH 
THEIR WORK AND HAD NO INTEREST IN POLITICS.  OTHERS WHOM 
CONOFF APPROACHED ATTESTED THAT IRANIANS ARE VERY 
PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ECONOMY AND MAKING ENDS MEET AND 
THEREFORE ARE NOT FOCUSED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF 
THE COUNTRY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
CONCERN FOR BOTH PALESTINIANS AND THE COST OF THAT SUPPORT 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
4.  (C) OF THE IRANIANS WHO ENGAGED IN DISCUSSION ABOUT THE 
ISSUE, IT APPEARS THAT THAT A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE 
POPULATION WOULD CLASSIFY THEMSELVES AS PRO-PALESTINIAN AND 
THEY ARE CONCERNED--ON A HUMANITARIAN LEVEL--ABOUT THE 
PALESTINIANS\' PLIGHT.  ONE IRANIAN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESSMAN 
ESTIMATED THAT 80% TO 90% OF IRANIANS ARE SYMPATHETIC 
TOWARDS THE PALESTINIANS\' CONDITION, AND AN IRANIAN STUDENT 
SPOKE FAVORABLY ABOUT THE UP-TICK IN VISIBLE IRANIAN 
HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIANS THIS PAST YEAR. 
ACCORDING TO HIM THE GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED PUBLIC APPEALS 
FOR IRANIANS TO DONATE MONEY TO PALESTINIANS AND HAS 
BROUGHT INJURED PALESTINIANS TO IRAN FOR TREATMENT. 
 
5.  (C) DESPITE THESE SYMPATHIES, HOWEVER, THE IRANIAN 
DUBAI-BASED BUSINESSMAN REPORTED THAT IT APPEARS TO MANY 
IRANIANS THAT IRAN IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF FIGHTING WHAT IS 
AN ESSENTIALLY AN ARAB FIGHT.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT IRAN IS 
THE MOST SUPPORTIVE AMONG THE REGION\'S COUNTRIES OF GIVING 
FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT TO THE PALESTINIANS AND 
THEY WONDER WHY ARABS ARE NOT SHOWING A SIMILAR LEVEL OF 
COMRADERIE.  MOREOVER, IRANIANS ARE CONCERNED THAT THEIR 
COUNTRY CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT AFFORD TO GIVE SUCH FINANCIAL 

SUPPORT AND THAT GIVEN THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
FACED AT HOME BY THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION \"EVERY 
PENNY COUNTS.\" 
 
6.  (C) THE MAJORITY OF IRANIANS INTERVIEWED BELIEVE THAT 
IRAN\'S SUPPORT OF THE PALESTINIANS IS LIMITED TO POLITICAL 
AND HUMANITARIAN FINANCIAL SUPPORT.  INTERVIEWEES COULD NOT 
QUANTIFY THE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT, HOWEVER ONE 
BUSINESSMAN SURMISED THAT THE CURRENT LEVEL \"IS LESS THAN 
IN THE PAST.\"  THE IRANIAN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESSMAN DID NOT 
BELIEVE THAT IRAN GAVE THE PALESTINIANS MILITARY SUPPORT. 
HE ASKED RHETORICALLY \"WHAT COULD THEY [IRAN] REALLY GIVE 
THAT COULD COUNTERACT ISRAEL?  THE ISRAELI MILITARY COULD 
FLATTEN PALESTINE, SYRIA AND LEBANON WITHIN TWO TO THREE 
DAYS.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
PUBLIC DOES NOT SHARE REGIME\'S VITRIOL IN PRIVATE 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
7.  (C) BESIDES THE ECONOMIC COST OF SUPPORTING THE 
PALESTINIANS, SEVERAL IRANIANS REPORTED THAT PEOPLE DO NOT 
SHARE THE LEVEL OF VITRIOL THE REGIME ESPOUSES VIS A VIS 
ISRAEL.  THE IRANIAN DUBAI-BASED BUSINESSMAN REPORTED THAT 
PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE HARSH RHETORIC BUT THAT THEY 
BELIEVE THAT \"AS LONG AS THE MULLAHS ARE IN GOVERNMENT\" 
IRAN WILL WANT TO \"ANNIHILATE\" ISRAEL AND WILL HOLD THAT 
GOAL AS A TENET OF THE REGIME.  INTERVIEWEES DID NOT SEEM 
TO SEE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT ON THIS 
ISSUE.  AS A 70-YR OLD RETIREE CAUTIONED, \"YOU MUST NOT 
LUMP IRANIAN PEOPLE IN WITH THE REGIME.\"  (SIMILAR POPULAR 
IDEOLOGICAL FATIGUE HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE PAST. REF 
DUBAI 1197 DATED 08 NOV 00.) 
 
8.  (C) THE BELIEF ALSO EXISTS THAT IRAN\'S SUPPORT OF THE 
PALESTINIAN CAUSE HAS A DISINGENUOUS ANGLE TO IT. 
ACCORDING TO A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR THE IRANIAN REGIME 
HYPES THE ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT TO SUIT ITS OWN 
PURPOSES DOMESTICALLY.  THE REGIME TRIED TO BLAME THE 
SERIAL MURDERS OF INTELLECTUALS ON \"ISRAELI INTERVENTION\" 
AND IS CURRENTLY HIGHLIGHTING THE SUFFERING OF THE 
PALESTINIANS TO TRY TO MAKE THE IRANIAN POPULACE FEEL 
FRIVOLOUS AND GREEDY FOR WANTING REFORMS AND \"HAVING FUN\" 
WHILE THEIR PALESTINIAN \"BRETHEREN\" ARE IN THEIR DARKEST 
HOUR. 
 
9.  (C) EXPRESSING VIEWPOINTS ABOUT THE ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN 
ISSUE THAT DEPART FROM THE OFFICIAL LINE IS SEEN TO BE A 
DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING.  THE PROFESSOR EXPLAINED THAT PEOPLE 
ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, AND DO NOT 
PUBLICLY VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF 
THE PALESTINIANS.  HE ADDED THAT THE CURRENT PUBLIC 
RETICENCE TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ABOUT A RANGE OF 
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES IS WIDESPREAD, AND THAT SINCE THE 
BERLIN CONFERENCE MANY INTELLECTUALS--LIKE PHILOSOPHER 
ABDOLKARIM SORUSH--HAVE STOPPED SPEAKING OUT AND ARE 
CHOOSING TO LIVE LOWER PROFILE LIVES. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
SOME SEGMENTS EVEN SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS ISRAEL 
--------------------------------------------- - 

10. (C) SEVERAL INTERVIEWEES REPORTED THAT A LATENT PRO- 
ISRAEL BIAS EXISTS.  A DUBAI TRADER WHO RECENTLY RETURNED 
FROM IRAN TOLD CONOFF THAT SEVERAL IRANIANS THAT HE SPOKE 
WITH EXPRESS PRO-ISRAEL SENTIMENTS BENEATH THE SURFACE.  HE 
ATTRIBUTED THIS TO THE FACT THAT ALTHOUGH IRANIANS WERE 
CONVERTED TO ISLAM, MANY STILL PERCEIVE A BOND OF KINSHIP 
BETWEEN THEIR ORIGINAL RELIGION OF ZOROASTRIANISM AND 
JUDAISM.  A SECOND BUSINESSMAN REPORTED THAT SENTIMENT 
EXISTS WITHIN THE IRANIAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT IF THE 
REGIME WOULD ONLY TONE DOWN ITS RHETORIC IRAN COULD HAVE 
GOOD BUSINESS RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL. 
 
11. (C) PAST INTERVIEWS WITH IRANIANS HAVE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED 
SOME PRO-ISRAEL SENTIMENT.  A MEMBER OF THE IRANIAN JEWISH 
COMMUNITY LAST NOVEMBER REPORTED THAT IRAN\'S JEWISH 
POPULATION FEELS A STRONG--BUT WELL-HIDDEN--AFFINITY FOR 
THE STATE OF ISRAEL. (REF DUBAI 1254 DATED 10 NOV 00) 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
MINORITY OPINION: IRAN INVOLVED TO COUNTER US 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
12. (C) OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF IRANIANS INTERVIEWED WHO 
BELIEVED THAT IRANIAN INVOLVEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE 
PALESTINIANS WAS WARRANTED, COUNTERING PERCEIVED PRO-ISRAEL 
US INFLUENCE WAS CITED AS THE PRINCIPAL MOTIVATOR. 
ACCORDING TO THE OWNER OF AN IRANIAN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY 
THE US HAS STOKED THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS AS A WAY TO PUSH 
IRAN TO INTERVENE IN THE REGION.  HEAVY US SUPPORT OF 
ISRAEL HAS INSURED THAT IRAN WOULD SUPPORT THE 
PALESTINIANS, AND PROVIDED A CONVENIENT PRETEXT FOR US 
CONTINUANCE OF ILSA.  HE LABELED ILSA PROPONENTS AS PRO- 
ISRAEL AND STATED THAT THOSE PROPONENTS HAD WANTED GORE 
INSTEAD TO WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 
 
13. (C) A DUBAI-BASED IRANIAN ENTREPRENEUR PROVIDED HIS 
OPINION OF WESTERN ASSERTIONS THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT 
IS A STATE SPONSOR OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  HE IS 
PRAGMATIC, BELIEVING THAT NEARLY EVERY GOVERNMENT SPONSORS 
TERRORISM, AND MAINTAINED THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IS 
NOT DOING \"ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN ISRAEL, THE US OR UK.\" 
ACCORDING TO HIM THE US SELECTIVELY SINGLES OUT IRAN AND HE 
USED THE UAE-IRAN DISPUTE OVER ABU MUSA AND THE TUNBS 
ISLANDS AS AN EXAMPLE, SAYING THAT THE ONLY TIME THE GCC 
MAKES BELLIGERENT STATEMENTS AGAINST IRAN IS WHEN THE US IS 
PRESSURING THEM TO PUNISH TEHRAN.  HE CONTINUED THAT THE 
ORGANS IN IRAN THAT CARRY OUT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM--SUCH 
AS THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES--ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR 
THE GOVERNMENT TO RETAIN POWER.

SUBJECT: IRANIANS EAGER TO JOIN THE INFORMATION AGE, BUT 
TEHRAN HAS SECOND THOUGHTS 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY ACTING CONSUL GENERAL JOHN LANCIA FOR 
REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY: IRANIAN USE OF THE INTERNET AND CELLULAR 
COMMUNICATION IS RAPIDLY EXPANDING AND THE TREND LOOKS SET 
TO CONTINUE. CONOFF SPOKE WITH A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND AN 
INTERNET/TELECOM COMPANY OWNER IN MAY ABOUT IRANIAN USE OF 
THE INTERNET AND MOBILE PHONES. THEY INDICATED THAT BOTH 
BUSINESSES ARE GROWING STEADILY DESPITE IRAN\'S POOR 
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE REGIME, HOWEVER, MAY BE HAVING SECOND 
THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION. IN MID-MAY 
TEHRAN TOOK MEASURES TO CURTAIL ACCESS TO SOME WEBSITES IT 
DEEMS IMMORAL OR THAT DISSEMINATE ANTI-REGIME POLITICAL AND 
SOCIAL VIEWS, BUT THEIR EFFORTS MAY PROVE FUTILE. CONOFF 
POLLED IRANIAN VISA APPLICANTS IN MAY AND JUNE ABOUT THE 
IMPACT OF THE GOVERNMENT FILTERING AND FOUND MOST 
INTERVIEWEES\' USE OF THE INTERNET UNAFFECTED BY THE NEW 
MEASURES. MOST OF THOSE SURVEYED SAID THAT FILTERING MAY 
PREVENT THEM FROM LOOKING UP SPECIFIC SITES ASSOCIATED WITH 
PROMINENT IRANIAN DISSIDENTS OR PRO-REFORM NEWSPAPERS, BUT 
IT WAS HAVING LITTLE IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO GET NEWS 
ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS IN IRAN, WHICH FOR THEM WAS MORE 
IMPORTANT. END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
IRANIANS LINING UP TO DIAL UP 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) URBAN IRANIANS ARE CLAMORING TO BE CONNECTED TO THE 
INTERNET AND IRANIAN BUSINESSES ARE STEPPING IN TO MEET THE 
RISING DEMAND, ALTHOUGH NOT WITHOUT OBSTACLES. CONOFF SPOKE 
WITH A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND THE OWNER OF A SMALL INTERNET 
COMPANY IN TEHRAN IN MAY TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO IRAN\'S LEAP 
INTO THE GLOBAL INFORMATION AGE. ACCORDING TO THE U.S.- 
TRAINED SOFTWARE ENGINEER, IRAN\'S INTERNET SERVICES ARE 
DOMINATED BY A HANDFUL OF LARGE COMPANIES, ALTHOUGH A 
NUMBER OF SMALL COMPANIES ARE SURVIVING DUE TO SHEER DEMAND 
VOLUME. THE ENGINEER SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED PARS ONLINE, 
WHICH IS PATTERNED AFTER U.S.-BASED AMERICA ONLINE, AS ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST RELIABLE PROVIDERS OF INTERNET 
SERVICES IN IRAN. THE OWNER OF A SMALL INTERNET COMPANY IN 
IRAN SHARED HIS VIEWS ON THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FACING 
TELECOM COMPANIES IN IRAN. HE SAID HIS COMPANY WAS ONE OF 
HUNDREDS IN TEHRAN THAT WAS SEEKING TO CAPITALIZE ON THE 
BOOM IN INTERNET, CELLULAR, AND CALLING CARD SERVICES IN 
IRAN. HOWEVER, HE LAMENTED THE LACK OF PRIVATIZATION WITHIN 
THE INDUSTRY, FOREIGN COMPETITION WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE, 
AND THE SLOW PACE WITH WHICH IRANIAN INSTITUTIONS WERE 
ADAPTING TO LARGE-SCALE USE OF THE INTERNET. FOR EXAMPLE, 
HE SAID THAT IRAN HAS NO E-COMMERCE CAPABILITY, WHICH 
PREVENTS IRANIAN BUSINESSES FROM ADVERTISING AND 
CAPITALIZING ON THE HUGE GROWTH IN INTERNET USE. HE 
CONTINUED BY SAYING THAT IRANIAN BANKS KNOW OF THE 
TECHNOLOGY, BUT WERE SLOW TO ADAPT, RESULTING IN THE LOSS 
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF POTENTIAL REVENUE. 
 
4. (C) FOR MOST IRANIANS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET IS EASY, 
ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG, AND IT IS STEADILY GAINING 
ACCEPTANCE AMONG ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY. ACCORDING TO THE 
SOFTWARE ENGINEER THE FIRST STEP INVOLVES BUYING A PREPAID 
INTERNET CARD, WHICH ALLOWS IRANIANS TO DIAL UP FROM ANY 
CONNECTED PC AND GAIN ACCESS. THE CHARGE IS RELATIVELY 
CHEAP FOR IRANIANS, ACCORDING TO SEVERAL STUDENTS CONOFF 
SPOKE WITH IN JUNE, RUNNING BETWEEN 2000 TO 4500 IRANIAN 
RIALS (IRR) PER HOUR (.24 TO .55 USD WITH 1 USD = 8170 IRR 
AS OF 23 JUNE 2003). BOTH THE ENGINEER AND THE INTERNET 
BUSINESS OWNER ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 2 
MILLION INTERNET USERS IN TEHRAN. BOTH SAID THAT IRAN\'S 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITIES ARE PLANNING FOR A SURGE OF 
UP TO 20 MILLION USERS NATIONWIDE WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE 
YEARS. 
 
5. (C) THE BOOM IN INTERNET SERVICE IS HAVING AN EFFECT ON 
RELATED BUSINESS SECTORS, SUCH AS COMPUTER SALES. THE 
SOFTWARE ENGINEER SAID THAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ABOUND 
IN THE COMPUTER FIELD, SPURRED BY IRANIANS\' DESIRE TO BE 
CONNECTED TO THE WORLD. HE CONTINUED BY SAYING THAT THE 
TREND IN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY IS TO COMPUTERIZE, AND 
SIGNIFICANT FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT TO MODERNIZE ALTHOUGH THE 
PROCESS IS MOVING SLOWLY. FOR EXAMPLE, AN EMPLOYEE OF 
IRAN\'S CENTRAL BANK SAID THAT CURRENTLY THERE WAS NO 
COMPUTER SYSTEM ALLOWING THE CENTRAL BANK OR OTHER BANKS IN 
TEHRAN TO COMMUNICATE WITH BRANCHES IN OTHER CITIES. THIS 
SHORTFALL SEVERELY LIMITS THE CENTRAL BANK\'S AUDITING 
CAPABILITY, AND THE BANK\'S MANAGEMENT HOPES COMPUTERIZATION 
MAY SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE ENGINEER WENT ON TO SAY THAT 
PERSONAL COMPUTERS WERE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN IRAN. MOST 
SYSTEMS RELIED ON IMPORTED PARTS, WHICH WERE THEN ASSEMBLED 
IN IRAN. HE ESTIMATED THE COST OF A COMPUTER TO BE ROUGHLY 
4.1 MILLION IRR (APPROXIMATELY 500 USD WITH $1=8170 IRR AS 
OF 23 JUNE 2003), NOT ENTIRELY OUT OF REACH FOR MIDDLE 
CLASS IRANIANS. HE INDICATED THAT GETTING SPECIALIZED 
EQUIPMENT, LIKE NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS, WAS MORE DIFFICULT, BUT 
A LOT OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT FROM ASIAN MANUFACTURERS IN 
KOREA, CHINA, AND JAPAN IS FLOWING INTO IRANIAN MARKETS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
REGIME, OTHER OBSTACLES IMPEDE THE FLOW OF INFORMATION 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6. (U) TEHRAN\'S EFFORTS AT CENSORSHIP OF THE INTERNET 
APPEAR TO BE ON THE RISE. IRAN\'S MINISTRY OF POST, 
TELEPHONE, AND TELEGRAPH (MPTT) BEGAN FILTERING THE FIRST 
OF AS MANY AS 15,000 WEBSITES ON 10 MAY, ACCORDING TO 
IRANIAN PRESS. THE FILTERING BEGAN FOLLOWING A DECREE FROM 
IRAN\'S SUPREME CULTURAL REVOLUTION COUNCIL, WHICH FORMED A 
THREE MEMBER PANEL COMPRISED OF THE INTELLIGENCE MINISTRY, 
MINISTRY OF ISLAMIC CULTURE AND GUIDANCE, AND THE NATIONAL 
BROADCASTING AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY PROHIBITED WEBSITES. 
MINISTER OF THE MPTT, SEYYED AHMAD MO\'TAMEDI, SAID IN MID- 
MAY THE REASON FOR THE FILTERING WAS TO PREVENT ACCESS TO 
IMMORAL SITES AND TO PREVENT THE DISSEMINATION OF ANTI- 
REGIME POLITICAL AND SOCIAL VIEWS VIA THE INTERNET. 
HOWEVER, DURING THE FIRST ROUND OF FILTERING A NUMBER OF 
DOMESTIC- AND FOREIGN-BASED NEWS SITES WERE SHUT DOWN, 
ACCORDING TO THE PRESS. INCLUDED AMONG THESE WERE POPULAR 
PRO-REFORM SITES SUCH AS EMROOZ, ASR-E NOW, AND AFTAB; 
SITES ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF IRAN\'S MOST WELL KNOWN 
DISSIDENTS SUCH AS DARIUSH FORUHAR AND AYATOLLAH HOSSEIN 
ALI MONTAZERI; AND SOME WESTERN-BASED PERSIAN LANGUAGE 
SITES INCLUDING RADIO FARDA AND RADIO LIBERTY. 
 
7. (C) DESPITE THE REGIME\'S STEPS TO BLOCK INTERNET ACCESS 
THEIR EFFORTS MAY ULTIMATELY PROVE FUTILE. ACCORDING TO 
SEVERAL STUDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS CONOFF SPOKE WITH IN 
LATE MAY AND JUNE, THE NEW, STRONGER GOVERNMENT FILTERS 
DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH POLITICAL AND NEWS SITES TEHRAN 
VIEWS AS ESPOUSING ANTI-REGIME MESSAGES. MOST INTERVIEWEES 
CITED FEW PROBLEMS IN GAINING ACCESS TO MAJOR NEWS 
WEBSITES, SUCH AS CNN OR BBC, TO VIEW CURRENT INFORMATION 
ON IRAN, WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE INTERVIEWEES, WAS MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN HAVING ACCESS TO DISSIDENT WEB PAGES. IN 
ADDITION, SOME IRANIAN OFFICIALS HAVE QUESTIONED THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF FILTERING, ACCORDING TO THE PRESS. THE 
DEPUTY FOR LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS FOR THE MPTT IN 
LATE MAY SAID THAT CURRENTLY WEBSITES EXIST THAT OFFER A 
WAY AROUND FILTERING AND THE NEW RESTRICTIONS WILL NOT 
PROVIDE A COMPLETE BLOCK OF SITES DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE BY 
THE REGIME. THE INTERNET BUSINESS OWNER OFFERED HIS VIEWS 
ON THE ISSUE, SAYING THAT CENSORSHIP WAS NOT AN ISSUE FOR 
MOST INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY USE FIBER 
OPTIC NETWORK CONNECTIONS THROUGH DUBAI TO LONDON, WHICH TO 
DATE HAVE ESCAPED CENSORSHIP FROM GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. 
THE ONLY PROBLEMS OCCURRED WITH THOSE PROVIDERS RELIANT ON 
SATELLITE CONNECTIONS, WHICH THE GOVERNMENT COULD MORE 
EASILY INTERRUPT. 
 
8. (C) THE INTERNET COMPANY OWNER, WHO WORKS BOTH IN IRAN 
AND THE UAE, CHARACTERIZED IRAN\'S COMMUNICATIONS 
INFRASTRUCTURE AS \'A MESS,\' AND A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO 
FUTURE GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY. HE SAID SERVICE PROVIDERS 
OFFERED ALL TYPES OF SERVICES INCLUDING DIGITAL SERVICE 
LINES (DSL) AND DIAL UP INTERNET CONNECTIONS, BUT OFTEN 
CONNECTIONS WERE UNRELIABLE. HE SAID APPLICATIONS FOR DSL 
CONNECTIONS TAKE UP TO NINE MONTHS FOR INSTALLATION, WHILE 
IN MOST WESTERN COUNTRIES, AND EVEN IN DUBAI, IT TAKES ONLY 
2-4 DAYS. HE SAID THAT MANY NEW BUILDINGS BEING CONSTRUCTED 
IN TEHRAN DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIAL INTERNET 
USAGE. USUALLY, A CONTRACTOR WILL ONLY APPLY FOR 40-50 
CONNECTIONS IN A RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX OF 120 APARTMENTS, 
MEANING ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS HAVE TO BE INSTALLED. ALL IN 
ALL HE SAID INTERNET SERVICE WAS UNEVEN, BUT THE SECTOR HAD 
POTENTIAL IF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE WOES WERE RESOLVED. THE 
ENGINEER ASSESSED IRAN\'S INFRASTRUCTURE AS \"OK\" WITH NEW, 
FASTER CONNECTIONS BECOMING AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, PROBLEMS 
REMAINED WITH SMALLER COMPANIES WHOSE SERVERS COULD STILL 
BE EASILY OVERLOADED, LEAVING MOST IRANIANS WITH UNRELIABLE 
SERVICE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
CELLULAR COMMUNICATION IN IRAN: BUSY SIGNALS ON THE RISE 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
9. (C) THE INTERNET COMPANY OWNER ALSO SPOKE ABOUT IRAN\'S 
EXPANDING MOBILE PHONE SECTOR. HE ESTIMATED THAT CURRENTLY 
THERE WERE MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION CELL PHONES IN TEHRAN WITH 
MORE BEING ADDED EVERY DAY. ACCORDING TO IRANIAN PRESS, THE 
MPTT IS UNDERTAKING AN EXPANSION EFFORT NATIONWIDE TO 
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF USERS OF THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS 
NETWORK FROM TWO TO FIVE MILLION. THE BUSINESS OWNER 
CONTINUED BY SAYING THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES TO 
DOING BUSINESS WAS THE MONOPOLY ENJOYED BY THE 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OF IRAN (TCI). PRIVATIZATION 
TALKS WERE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY, AND ACCORDING TO AN IRANIAN 
CONSULTANT CONOFF SPOKE WITH IN JUNE, DEPUTY MINISTER FOR 
PROGRAMMING AT THE MPTT, NASROLLAH JAHANGARD, IS 
SUCCESSFULLY SPEARHEADING THE EFFORT TOWARDS A CONCLUSION. 
THE BUSINESS OWNER CONTINUED SAYING THAT TCI WAS COMPETING 
WITH SMALLER COMPANIES, HAVING RECENTLY SLASHED THEIR 
CELLULAR RATES BY UP TO 70 PERCENT, AND WERE LOOKING TO 
QUASH THEIR COMPETITION BEFORE PRIVATIZATION TOOK PLACE. 
 
10. (C) THE INTERNET COMPANY OWNER ALSO SPOKE ABOUT THE 
CURRENT BUSINESS LANDSCAPE IN THE TELECOM SECTOR, PROBLEMS 
FACING THE INDUSTRY, AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN COMPANIES. 
HE SAID THE PROCESS TO START HIS BUSINESS WAS QUITE SIMPLE. 
IRANIAN BANKS OFFERED FAVORABLE RATES ON BUSINESS LOANS AND 
THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED NEW TELECOM COMPANIES BY NOT 
REQUIRING THEM TO PAY TAXES. HOWEVER, HE WAS PESSIMISTIC 
ABOUT THE NEXT TWO YEARS BECAUSE THE IRANIAN MARKET WAS 
VIRTUALLY CLOSED AND FEW OPPORTUNITIES EXISTED FOR IRANIAN 
COMPANIES TO EXPAND INTO OVERSEAS MARKETS. ONE MAJOR 
PROBLEM WITHIN THE INDUSTRY WAS POOR PLANNING RELATED TO 
CELL PHONE TOWERS. THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH OF THEM, WHICH IN 
TURN, PROVIDED POOR CONNECTIONS AND NOT ENOUGH COVERAGE FOR 
THE VOLUME OF DEMAND. HE ALSO LAMENTED THE FOREIGN 
COMPETITION IRANIAN COMPANIES HAD TO FACE. CURRENTLY MODELS 
FROM FOREIGN COMPANIES SUCH AS NOKIA AND ERICSSON WERE VERY 
POPULAR, AND COMPANIES FROM CHINA AND KOREA (SAMSUNG) WERE 
DOMINATING THE IRANIAN MARKET. IN ADDITION, EUROPEAN 
MANUFACTURERS SUCH AS NOKIA AND ERICSSON HAD RECENTLY WON A 
CONCESSION FROM TCI TO MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE SIM CARDS 
UNDER THEIR OWN BRAND NAME IN IRAN, GIVING THEM A STRONGER 
PRESENCE WITHIN THE DOMESTIC MARKET. 
 
------------------------ 
NO HOLDING BACK THE TIDE 
------------------------ 
 
11. (C) COMMENT: IRANIANS ARE DETERMINED TO LEAP INTO THE 
INFORMATION AGE, DESPITE THE REGIME\'S HESITATION, BY FULLY 
EMBRACING MODERN TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE INTERNET AND 
MOBILE PHONES. IRAN IS EXPANDING ITS INTERNET AND MOBILE 
PHONE SYSTEMS WITH THE ONLY OBSTACLE BEING THEIR OWN 
INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE UPGRADES WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT 
INVESTMENTS OF MONEY AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO RECTIFY, 
BUT IT CAN BE DONE. CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, APPEAR DETERMINED TO STEM THE FREE 
FLOW OF INFORMATION. THEIR FOCUS IS ON THOSE WEBSITES 
ESPOUSING ALTERNATIVES TO THE CURRENT REGIME, BUT BASED ON 
INTERVIEWEES\' ACCOUNTS THEY ARE FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE. 
TECHNICAL SHORTCOMINGS PREVENT BLOCKING \"PROHIBITED\" SITES 
ENTIRELY, AND MOST IRANIANS CONOFF SPOKE WITH ARE GETTING 
THE NEWS THEY WANT DESPITE TEHRAN\'S EFFORTS. TEHRAN COULD 
EXPAND FILTERING TO INCLUDE MAINSTREAM DOMESTIC AND 
WESTERN-BASED MEDIA SITES OR PROHIBIT INTERNET ACCESS ALL 
TOGETHER. HOWEVER, SUCH STEPS WOULD LIKELY ENGENDER A 
BACKLASH FROM INTELLECTUALS, STUDENTS, AND OTHER MIDDLE- TO 
UPPER-CLASS IRANIANS WHO HAVE COME TO SEE MODERN 
COMMUNICATIONS METHODS AS CENTRAL TO DAILY LIFE. END 
COMMENT.

ABOUT FTA NEGOTIATIONS 
 
REF: A) DUBAI 5011   B) ABU DHABI 3834  C) DUBAI 4507 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Jason L. Davis, Consul General, Dubai, UAE. 
REASON: 1.4 (b) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: Obaid Al-Tayer, prominent Dubai businessman and 
President of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI), 
told Consul General December 29 that the process of negotiating 
a US-UAE Free Trade Agreement \"will not be easy.\"  That said, 
Dubai businessmen were not against the FTA; rather, they just 
wanted to ensure that the final product was a good one. 
Al-Tayer highlighted several concerns that he said were being 
raised by Dubai merchant families.  Among them: inadequate 
information sharing by the UAEG negotiators; a perception that 
the USG position was inflexible; fears that a bilateral FTA 
might endanger Dubai\'s access to the Saudi market and further 
isolate Saudi Arabia; concerns about the agency law; and worries 
that an FTA might lead to even greater numbers of Indians and 
Pakistanis moving to Dubai. End Summary. 
 
Buy-In from Businessmen 
----------------------- 
 
2. (C) DCCI President Obeid Al-Tayer expressed concern to Consul 
General December 29 that the concerns of Dubai businessmen and 
merchant families were not being taken into account by the UAE 
negotiating team.  \"When we tell them we want to be a part of 
the process, they tell us that the U.S. side insists that only 
government officials can be a part of the negotiations.  But we 
are concerned that our bureaucrats may not be our best 
negotiators and may not have sufficient knowledge of what is 
important to our business community.\"  Warning that \"these 
negotiations are not going to be easy,\" Al-Tayer said it would 
be very important to secure the buy-in of the business 
community, since they were the ones who would be \"implementing\" 
whatever agreements were signed.  CG pointed out that while it 
might not be possible for business to be present at the 
negotiating table, there was no reason they could not provide 
the UAEG with input on their views and concerns.  It would be 
natural for the views of businessmen to be taken into 
consideration. 
 
3. (C) Al-Tayer said he thought the businessmen were being cut 
out because UAEG officials believed they were against the 
agreement.  This was not true:  as he himself had recently told 
Dubai Crown Prince Mohammed bin Rashid (MbR) and UAE Minstate 
for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid (HbZ), \"We recognize that 
there has been a political decision to go ahead with the FTA, 
and we are not against that decision; we just want to ensure 
that the final agreement is in the best long-term interests of 
the UAE.\" Asked how MbR and HbZ had responded, Al-Tayer said 
they had been supportive, but had given the impression that 
there was little point in discussing the concerns of the 
businessmen because the U.S. had a standard FTA that it signed 
with every country that couldn\'t be altered. If Ambassador 
Zoellick\'s comment during his visit that the U.S. \"doesn\'t take 
a \'cookie-cutter\' approach is true,\" he said, then \"someone must 
have misinformed the Sheikhs.\" 
 
GCC Concerns: Don\'t Alienate Saudis 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Al-Tayer asked why the FTA could not be negotiated with 
the entire GCC rather than bilaterally with each country. There 
was a perception, he added, that the U.S. was strong-arming 
countries into doing it bilaterally in order to divide and 
thereby weaken the GCC.  Assuring Al-Tayer that there was no 
truth to that conspiracy theory, CG said it was his 
understanding that the decision to negotiate bilaterally had 
been strongly supported by the UAEG because it was the only 
realistic way of getting an FTA in a timely fashion. Weren\'t 
those in Dubai who talked about the need to go through the GCC 
essentially saying that they were opposed to the FTA in 
principle, and arguing for GCC involvement in the belief that 
doing so would delay the agreement indefinitely? 
 
5. (C) Acknowledging that there might be some truth to this 
perception, Al-Tayer nonetheless argued that there was much more 
to it than that.  The biggest concern in Dubai was to avoid 
endangering Dubai\'s access to the Saudi market.  Whatever 
happened with the FTA, it would be critical to \"contain\" or 
manage the Saudi reaction.  Dubai was extremely vulnerable in 
this regard; Saudi Arabia was Dubai\'s second biggest export 
market after Iran.  According to certificates of origin issued 
in Dubai, Dubai\'s re-exports to Saudi Arabia last year were UAED 
10.5 billion, and by early December this year they had already 
reached UAED 13.5 billion -- and that didn\'t even include 
\"national products,\" i.e those with at least 40 percent value 
added in Dubai (according to the GCC customs union rules, 
\"national products\" are allowed duty-free entry to other GCC 
countries, whereas re-exports are subject to 5 percent duty, 
collected by the receiving country.) Dubai had a manufacturing 
sector that was dependent on the Saudi market for up to 70 
percent of its sales, particular in the food sector.  \"If the 
Saudis were to retaliate to a bilateral FTA by requiring their 
imports to go through Saudi ports, and not through Dubai, we 
would be finished,\" Al-Tayer suggested. 
 
6. (C) There were other reasons why it made sense to \"work with 
the Saudis rather than pushing them to close up,\" Al-Tayer 
proposed. \"We want the Saudis to be more integrated with us, not 
less; we believe that through engagement with them we can slowly 
change their culture -- just as we have become more tolerant and 
cosmopolitan through our history of interaction with other 
cultures.\" 
 
Agency Law 
---------- 
 
7. (C) Al-Tayer said there were many misperceptions regarding 
Dubai\'s concerns about the Agency Law.  First among them was 
that this was a \"Dubai only\" issue.  In reality, at least 50 
percent of registered agency relationships were in Abu Dhabi. 
Secondly, many in Dubai were wondering why it was necessary to 
\"scrap\" the Agency Law altogether, which was the only solution 
the UAEG negotiators seemed willing to consider.  It would be 
one thing to offer a waiver to US companies as part of the give 
and take that the FTA would bring.  But why should negotiations 
with the U.S. lead to instant benefits, in exchange for nothing, 
to European or Indian companies?  That is what would happen if 
the Agency Law were \"cancelled\" as part of the FTA negotiating 
process. In response to a direct question, Al-Tayer confirmed 
CG\'s impression that there was essentially no one in Dubai who 
was opposed to granting new-to-market US companies wanting to do 
business in Dubai an exemption to the Company and Agency Laws in 
the context of an FTA; the only concern was finding a mechanism 
for protecting existing agency and company relationships. Even 
in those cases there was no desire to force an unsatisfied 
company to remain with agent that was not providing acceptable 
service; rather there was a desire to find a mechanism for 
ensuring that the relationship was being broken due to genuine 
failure on the part of the agent rather than something more 
\"arbitrary.\" 
 
Immigration Concerns 
-------------------- 
 
8. (C) A final concern raised by Al-Tayer was a fear among 
Dubayyans that an FTA with the U.S. might lead to a huge influx 
of Indians moving to Dubai from their home country. The danger, 
as he saw it, was that Indian-Americans would use the FTA as a 
mechanism for moving their extended families from their home 
countries to Dubai. \"It is one thing if we are talking about a 
manufacturing operation, but our fear is that they Americans of 
Indian descent will open grocery stores and shops and then bring 
all of their cousins and nephews to staff them...this 
(immigration from India) is a very sensitive matter for us.\" 
When CG questioned why an FTA with the U.S. would have any 
bearing on UAE policies regarding admission of guest workers 
from India, Al-Tayer said that UAE nationals who owned 
businesses here had the right to bring in guest workers, and 
that it was his understanding that granting \"national treatment\" 
to US companies would allow them to do the same. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (C) Some of Al-Tayer\'s concerns appear to reflect a 
fundamental misunderstanding of a bilateral FTA (namely that the 
U.S. would negotiate market access on behalf of other countries 
and that national treatment equates to an unrestricted 
immigration right).  USG officials have addressed both questions 
in informal conversations with the UAEG, and we believe that 
they understand that neither is the case.  Given the UAEG\'s 
concerns about demographic imbalances, we do not believe that 
they will -- even inadvertently -- assume that national 
treatment equates to an unlimited immigration right. 
Al-Tayer\'s comments about access to the Saudi market demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the Saudi campaign in raising tension among 
Dubai businesses.  In our conversations with the UAEG, however, 
they have stressed their intention to move forward with a FTA 
and their belief that the \"Saudi problem\" is one that can and 
should be addressed at the technical level and for which there 
are reasonable solutions.

CLASSIFIED BY: Jason Davis, Consul General, Dubai , UAE. 
REASON: 1.4 (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Dubai\'s \"Executive Office,\" headed by Mohammed 
Gergawi, has long been a key player in \"Dubai Inc,\" the term 
used to describe the various parastatal organizations that the 
Ruler\'s Office has set up to manage and oversee the development 
of Dubai.  The Executive Office has recently been split into two 
separate arms, one (known as \"Dubai Holding\") consisting of all 
the for-profit businesses, and a second consisting of the 
regulatory and governmental functions of the rump Executive 
Office.  Still fully owned by the Dubai government, Dubai 
Holding is now organized as a major corporation, with six 
companies worth billions of dollars under its umbrella. The 
three regulatory/government entities of the Executive Office, 
meanwhile, have been organized as separate government agencies. 
The purpose of the restructuring, according to Dubai Holding CFO 
Fadel Al Ali, is to adopt international standards of corporate 
governance and transparency so that Dubai Holding can emerge as 
a respected global player. End Summary. 
 
From the Executive Office to Dubai Holding 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Dubai\'s \"Executive Office,\" headed by Mohammed Gergawi, 
has long been a key player in \"Dubai Inc,\" the term used loosely 
to describe the various parastatal organizations that the Dubai 
Ruler\'s Office set up to manage and oversee the development of 
Dubai. (The other two major components of Dubai, Inc are Sultan 
bin Sulayem\'s \"Corporate Office,\" which includes Dubai Ports and 
Customs as well as the real estate giant \"Nakheel\"; and Mohammed 
Al-Abbar\'s \"Emaar,\" another real estate giant.) 
 
3. (U) Until recently, the Executive Office was an umbrella 
organization incorporating both business and government 
operations -- everything from the quasi-governmental Dubai 
Development and Investment Authority (DDIA) to the purely 
for-profit Dubai Internet City. On October 8, however, the 
government of Dubai announced that the Executive Office would be 
split up into three \"independent\" government bodies and one 
private corporation which would be known as \"Dubai Holding.\" 
With Dubai Crown Prince and de facto ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin 
Rashid (MbR) as its Chairman, Dubai Holding is one of the 
biggest companies in the region, holding billions of dollars in 
assets. It remains 100 percent owned by the government of Dubai, 
though rumors abound that it was spun off from the Executive 
Office in part so that it can eventually be taken public in an 
IPO. 
 
4. (C) On January 2, PolEconoff spoke to Fadel Al Ali, Chief 
Financial Officer of Dubai Holding and formerly a Citibank Dubai 
executive for 18 years, about the reasons behind the recent 
restructuring. Al Ali\'s take was that Dubai, now that it was 
emerging as a major international player, needed to meet 
accepted international standards -- and this meant in part 
\"drawing a line\" between the government and the private sector. 
He said Dubai Holding would have a corporate structure, clear 
standards of corporate governance, a board, and -- eventually -- 
a public declaration of its balance sheet. \"We are perhaps 70 
percent transparent now; our aim is to become 100 percent 
transparent. We can no longer be run on a project-by-project 
basis....His Highness\'s (MbR\'s) vision is for Dubai Holding to 
be a truly multinational company.\" Al Ali predicted that Sultan 
bin Sulayem\'s Corporate Office (Ref A) -- see para 2, above -- 
would soon undergo a similar restructuring. 
 
Dubai Holding -- The Breakdown 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) Al Ali said Dubai Holding (DH) was essentially a shell 
company, and one with a very small staff. \"We basically created 
a mother after the birth of the children,\" he noted wryly. Al 
Ali said DH had nine Board Members (not including MbR) and that 
there were six distinct companies inside Dubai Holding. Gergawi 
(as CEO), Al Ali himself, and the CEO\'s of the six companies 
CEO\'s were all Board Members; the ninth board member was the 
head of MbR\'s private \"Investment Office\" (which is charged with 
investing MbR\'s personal wealth), selected because his office 
has large investments in DH. 
 
6. (C) The first of DH\'s six companies is TECOM Investments, 
headed by CEO Ahmed Bin Byat. TECOM includes Internet City, 
Media City, Knowledge Village, Arabian Radio Network, and 
several other media-related firms. The second of the six DH 
companies, run by Saeed Al Muntafig (who also heads DDIA -- see 
para 7) is known as \"Tatweer Dubai\" (\"Developing Dubai\"). 
Tatweer controls free zone projects such as Dubai Healthcare 
City (in cooperation with Harvard Medical -- ref B), Dubai 
Humanitarian City (ref C), and large non-free zone projects such 
as Dubailand and Dubai Industrial City. The third DH company is 
Dubai Properties, the property development and management arm of 
DH, run by Hashem Al Dabal. (Dubai Properties controls the USD 
two billion freehold real estate development Jumeirah Beach 
Residence (ref D) as well as \"Business Bay,\" the newly-announced 
multi-billion dollar project to develop and extend Dubai\'s Creek 
into a high-rise lined arc stretching back through the desert to 
Sheikh Zayid road.) 
 
7. (C) The fourth arm of DH is Dubai International Capital, a 
completely new entity run by Sameer Al Ansari, until recently 
Chief Financial Officer of the Executive Office. (Al Ansari\'s 
company will invest money raised by the DH\'s other branches into 
companies in the Middle East, Europe, and the US. The fifth 
company, Jumeirah International, has a hotel and hospitality 
focus; it is headed by Gerald Lawless. (Jumeirah owns the 
landmark \"seven star\" Burj Al Arab Hotel, the Emirates Towers 
Hotel, and several other hotels in Dubai and the UK.) The sixth 
and final DH company is Dubai International Properties, headed 
by Farhan Faraidooni, which will invest in projects throughout 
the region, including Lebanon, Libya, and Qatar. 
 
The Government Authorities 
-------------------------- 
 
8. (C) The spin-off of all the Executive Office\'s business 
projects into DH left a rump Executive office now divided into 
three governmental entities.  The first of those, TECOM 
Authority, does licensing, free zone rules, and other government 
activities for the TECOM free zones (including Dubai Internet 
City and Dubai Media City). A second governmental entity, the 
Dubai Development and Investment Authority (DDIA), run by Saeed 
Al Muntafiq, is the project-germinating wing of the government 
and will continue to generate ideas aimed at attracting outside 
investment to further develop Dubai. DDIA has responsibility for 
the planned Dubai Mercantile Exchange, to be jointly run with 
the New York Mercantile Exchange (ref E). 
 
9. (C) The third governmental entity remaining following the 
spin-off of Dubai Holding will oversee existing government 
improvement-related initiatives such as the Dubai Government 
Excellence Program (ref F) and the new Dubai School of 
Government (ref G).  This third entity will continue to be 
known, somewhat confusingly, as \"The Executive Office.\" 
According to Al Ali, the new Executive Office will \"backstop\" 
the Executive Council, Dubai\'s Cabinet-like government 
consultative body made up of all the Dubai government department 
heads and chaired by MbR (Ref H). Nabil Al Yousuf, a top 
director at the Executive Office, told us the new Executive 
Office would liaise with all the government departments and 
present new policy initiatives to the Executive Council. DH\'s Al 
Ali, however, downplayed the Executive Office\'s role, saying it 
would be \"limited to government performance benchmarking, 
education programs, and improvement of government efficiency.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) \"Dubai, Inc.\" is the somewhat sardonic catchphrase used 
to describe the government-led, public-private sector 
partnerships that have been responsible for Dubai\'s meteoric 
rise from a smallish fishing and trading town to something 
approaching a world-class metropolis. The restructuring of the 
Executive Office and the spinning off of Dubai Holding suggests 
that Dubai\'s leaders understand the need for greater 
transparency and better business practices.  The restructuring 
is also a tacit acknowledgement that the blurry borders between 
government and business that have served Dubai so well until now 
could become a liability as Dubai\'s focus becomes more 
international.

SUBJECT: DUBAI GOV\'T REMAINS WILLING TO ENGAGE ON BUILDING NOB FOR 
CONSULATE 
 
REF: A) STATE 225187  B) DUBAI 4928 
 
This is an action request -- See para 6. 
 
1. Consul General met December 20 with Sultan bin Sulayem (SBS), 
the Dubai government\'s point person for the proposed NOB for 
ConGen Dubai, to review the points raised in reftel.  Following 
is a summary of the discussion, which was favorable overall. 
 
2. Contractors: SBS said there were three US companies he was 
currently working with (on other projects in Dubai who could be 
interested in the proposed NOB project:  Parsons, KBR, and 
Bechtel, all major, well-known entities. Regarding the CAA point 
raised in para 7 of reftel, SBS said he \"completely understood\" 
that the selected contractor would be given classified 
information that would figure into the cost of the project but 
which could not be made available to the Dubai government. 
(Note: reftel mentioned that OBO could provide a list of 
already-cleared contractors currently doing work with OBO who 
could be contacted to provide a competitive bid.  Post would 
appreciate receiving that information so it can be shared with 
the Dubai authorities.) 
 
3. SED documentation/CD:  SBS thanked us for providing the CD 
and said he was certain that, while it showed a building that 
was larger than what would be needed for the Consulate, it would 
be useful in giving his planners and architects a better sense 
of what would be involved in the project. 
 
4. Scope of project: SBS balked at the idea (expressed in paras 
2 and 3 of reftel) that Dubai would pay for outbuildings 
(including a warehouse annex), fit-out and interior furnishings. 
 He said that what he was proposing was building, to USG 
standards, a basic 4,000 GSM office building, surrounded by a 
perimeter wall that included compound access control.  Any 
outbuildings and all but the most basic interior furnishings 
would need to be provided at USG expense; even communication and 
computer lines would be best supplied and installed by the USG, 
though this should not be difficult because the building would 
be outfitted by the cleared US contractor with conduit.  (Note: 
SBS\'s position on these issues strikes us as reasonable. With 
the Embassy Abu Dhabi warehouse less than an hour and a half a 
way by car, Dubai does not currently require a warehouse of its 
own, and we see little logic to compelling the Dubai government 
to construct one on the relatively small (6 acre) plot in 
question.  Similarly, given that we are talking about an effort 
to remedy an unacceptable security situation, we do not believe 
the project should be made contingent on the landlord providing 
interior furnishings.  If necessary, post could utilize 
furniture from our existing facility.) 
 
5. While he was somewhat more cautious about the cost and scope 
of the project than he had been in previous conversations, SBS 
made it clear that Dubai remained ready to work with us on this 
proposal.  He reiterated that he looked forward to receiving a 
more detailed plan that he could put out to his contractors for 
at least an initial cost estimate.  He added that, while Dubai 
remained willing to build a new consulate building and then rent 
it back to us indefinitely, Dubai would strongly prefer an 
approach that would allow ownership of the property to pass to 
the U.S. once a sufficient number of \"lease\" payments had been 
made to cover the cost of construction. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
6. Per para 6, reftel, post requests that Department initiate 
the necessary planning process so that we can move forward 
toward formalizing an arrangement with the appropriate parties 
in Dubai.

SUBJECT: DUBAI\'S PROPERTY MARKET PART THREE -- BOOM OR BUST? 
 
REF: A) Dubai 3286  Ref B) Dubai 4371 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Dubai\'s property market has been growing too 
big, too fast, according to many observers. Others, concerned 
that currently skyrocketing property prices in Dubai are not 
good for business, look to the construction surge to assuage 
this demand.  Since the 2002 advent of property sales to 
foreigners, scores of \"freehold\" high-rises with thousands of 
apartments have been put up for sale, often years before they 
are even built. Insider estimates put the total number of units 
being constructed at roughly 130,000, and estimate total 
freehold development announced so far at around USD 50 billion. 
While there are solid economic trends propelling this market, 
many insiders believe prices will drop; few, however, are 
predicting a crash. On average, they estimate a fall of around 
20 percent, perhaps two to three years out. This cable, the last 
in a three-part series on Dubai\'s freehold property market, 
looks at the size of the construction boom, the factors 
propelling it, and the possibility of a slump in prices. Part 
One of the series (Ref A) looked at the legal status of freehold 
property, while Part Two (Ref B) looked at who was buying it. 
End Summary. 
 
Background on Freeholds 
----------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Until recently (Ref A), real estate in Dubai could be 
owned only by UAE and other GCC nationals. The huge foreign 
population resident in Dubai (foreign residents are estimated to 
constitute more than 90 percent of Dubai\'s total population of 
over one million) had been restricted to renting. (Note: This 
practice is common in many countries in the region, where there 
is great sensitivity about selling off the patrimony to 
outsiders.) In May 2002, the Dubai government gave permission to 
three companies to develop and sell \"freehold\" properties to 
foreigners on government-designated pieces of land. The 
pro-growth government of cosmopolitan Dubai, recognizing the 
potentially huge contribution that foreign ownership could make 
to Dubai\'s development, viewed the move as a very logical, even 
essential, next step. 
 
Size of the Boom 
---------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Other GCC countries have also announced large freehold 
property developments to be sold to foreigners, but Dubai\'s are 
on a different scale. The growth in freehold properties in Dubai 
has been mammoth by any measure, whether looking at the money 
invested in construction, the dollar amount of total sales, or 
the number of units being constructed. Aggregate numbers are 
hard to come by. Perhaps fearing that investors might be nervous 
if they knew the full magnitude of the construction, or possibly 
because the pace of new development quickly makes estimates out 
of date, neither the developers nor the Dubai government makes 
public any Dubai-wide totals. While all such numbers should be 
approached with caution, the CEO of a major Dubai developer told 
PolEconoff recently that some USD 50 billion in freehold 
property construction was either underway or announced. 
 
4. (SBU) A property surveyor estimated that Dubai freehold 
announcements so far have totaled about 130,000 units, with only 
around 8,000 or so of those finished. Property giant Emaar\'s USD 
10 billion Dubai Marina, well underway, is to have a residential 
capacity of 150,000 (roughly 37,000 units, assuming an average 
of four family members per unit), and it is sold out. The GM of 
a prominent golf course, a UAE national, told PolEconoff that 
the government planned to put 186,000 people (approx. 46,000 
units) in the huge projects surrounding his course. Illustrative 
of the size of the boom (and what most upset this manager) was 
the phenomenal growth in the number of golf courses in Dubai -- 
currently six, but slated to be 20. 
 
5. (SBU) Dubai has grown quickly and so far very successfully 
with a \"build it and they will come\" mentality, and the property 
market is no exception. Many people believe, however, that this 
time Dubai has gone too far, too fast. Two questions heard 
frequently around town are: Will the demand for freehold 
property be strong enough to match the huge supply that is 
currently in train, justifying the massive investment?  And if 
the prices do go down, when it will happen and to what extent? 
 
Pro: Solid Reasons Behind Freehold Growth 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Proponents of Dubai freeholds cite several reasons for 
their confidence in Dubai\'s trajectory. Some of these are 
systemic factors not specifically derived from the property 
market but boosting it nonetheless. First, Dubai is a 
cosmopolitan city and, by most accounts, the most desirable 
place to live in the Gulf. The UAE is politically stable, and 
its economy, particularly in Dubai, is growing quickly. Dubai\'s 
allure also derives from its tax-free environment. Oil prices 
are high and the GCC, particularly since 9/11, prefers to keep 
more of its money close to home. As Simon Azzam, CEO of local 
property developer Union Properties, recently told the Gulf 
News, \"Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world.\" 
 With an official population of a little over a million, press 
reports abound that Dubai expects its population to double by 
2010 (around 15 percent growth per year).  If that estimate were 
to hold true, the number of freehold units mentioned in para 
three could actually be insufficient. 
 
7. (SBU) In addition to favorable macroeconomic considerations, 
real estate \"bulls\" in Dubai point to several factors endemic to 
Dubai\'s property market. Current demand is so high that 
apartment rents across the city have been increasing 
dramatically. Even hotel occupancy rates are at an all-time 
high.  A.J. Jaganathan, CEO of Dubai developer Emaar, told the 
Khaleej Times that, \"Dubai has an expatriate population with 
(freehold) purchasing capability of about 300,000. Of them, 
about 30,000-35,000 (i.e. only some 10 percent) have bought 
property so far.  At the same time, the population of Dubai in 
the income bracket that could buy is growing at about four to 
five percent, although the total growth rate is much higher.\" 
 
8. (SBU) Another reason to believe that property prices are 
likely to remain strong despite rising supply is that Dubai has 
so far not introduced its new property regulations.  The 
resultant hazy legal environment of buying a freehold has scared 
many potential investors away (Ref A). Once the new laws are 
promulgated and working smoothly, these risk-averse expats will 
likely be much more willing to buy. Furthermore, without the 
proper legal infrastructure, the mortgage market for Dubai\'s 
freeholds is for the most part untapped; as it develops and 
expands, customers will be able to buy more easily, and the 
freehold market as a whole will become more liquid and mature. 
 
Con: Why Freehold Prices Might Drop 
----------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Despite all of the solid reasons for the size and pace 
of Dubai\'s freehold frenzy, many observers believe current 
prices cannot be sustained. Even Sultan bin Sulayem, Chairman of 
Dubai\'s property giant Emaar, predicted to a local newspaper on 
December 8 that Dubai\'s property market would \"cool down.\" 
Sulayem, also a top official in the Dubai government, said, 
\"...it is not in Dubai\'s interest to have such high prices for 
real estate.\" The head of a British bank predicted to PolEconoff 
recently that \"supply will outstrip demand,\" and the Emirati 
head of a local bank, noting that there were \"too many 
properties under construction\" wondered, \"Who will live in all 
these?\" 
 
10. (SBU) People predicting a fall in prices cite several 
concerns. Most importantly, they believe that the forces fueling 
freehold growth have already been factored (or perhaps 
over-factored) into the price. It is this optimism that has 
caused so much speculation. Indeed, 70 to 80 percent or more of 
freehold sales have been to speculators and to other investors 
who will not, ultimately, reside in the properties they have 
bought. The Dubai government has recently become more aware of 
the danger of such rampant property speculation and introduced 
rules -- or pushed developers to introduce rules -- to slow down 
this trend. Buyers of units in many of the newest projects have 
had to sign a contract that precludes onward sales for a period 
of two years.  Owners of apartments in the Jumeirah Beach 
Residence have been told that the fee to transfer the \"title\" 
(actually just a contractual obligation until they are built and 
registered) would be seven percent of the market price of units 
currently for sale. 
 
11. (SBU) Pessimists also point out that, as mentioned in para 
3, of the 130,000 freehold units to be built, less than 10 
percent have been completed. Even in the finished tower blocks 
of Dubai Marina, which have all sold out, only about 15 percent 
appear to be occupied. As each project is completed, speculators 
who have not already unloaded their properties will have to 
either find renters, sell, or keep them vacant in hopes of 
appreciation. Moreover, Dubai residents who do physically move 
into new projects are leaving behind vacant apartments. As this 
trend accelerates, it could lead to falling rental prices, which 
could in turn drag down purchase prices. 
 
12. (SBU) A final reason sometimes cited for pessimism in the 
property market is related to construction quality. Buying based 
on a blueprint, and without a chance to \"kick the tires,\" 
purchasers have taken the developers at their word. But many 
insiders have expressed grave concern about how well these 
places are being built. An article soon to be published by Dow 
Jones Newswires, for example, documents the problems in Emaar\'s 
Garden View villas, where residents of 100 villas were recently 
moved out of one area because of shoddy construction. (Note: 
These residents actually got a windfall, as they were given 
nicer and more expensive houses in a nearby development.) An 
expat site manager of a construction team told PolEconoff that 
he guessed many of these units would last for 10 years, but that 
after that many might no longer be livable. The GM of a local 
bank, talking about how construction firms had been cutting 
corners in the face of the rising cost of materials, said he 
could not see offering 20-year mortgages on places that would 
likely be falling apart in 10 years. (Note: Fifteen-year 
mortgages of 70 percent are quickly becoming the norm.)  Dubai\'s 
media, while doing a good job of hyping the property market, has 
reported practically no stories about poor building quality; 
once this information becomes widely disseminated, some insiders 
believe, prices are bound to fall. 
 
Crash or Soft Landing? 
---------------------- 
 
13. (SBU) On average, the property \"bears\" seem to think that 
freehold prices in two or three years will be around 20 percent 
less than they are today. The CEO of one large developer told us 
that three corrections were coming, the first in the beginning 
of 2006 (scheduled completion of Palm Jumeirah) and then two 
more corresponding with the completion of other massive 
developments. He thought the combined effect would be a drop of 
10 to 20 percent, but that the market would not crash -- though 
he still predicted that some speculators would be \"left holding 
the bag.\"  The GM of a local bank predicted, \"In four to five 
years there will be a crunch,\" while the head of another bank 
thought that \"the market will be safe for two to three years, 
then there will be a slump.\"  In fact, the market may be already 
starting to lose a little steam; while the premiums on 
properties (the amount the properties have appreciated since 
they were first sold) are still very high, there are some 
reports that these premiums have dropped a bit of late (Ref B). 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
14. (SBU) The sheer magnitude of the freehold property 
construction boom in Dubai is striking. With investors willing 
to keep bankrolling new projects, Dubai has a strong incentive 
to come up with new multi-billion dollar developments to offer 
them. As strong as the underlying factors propelling this frenzy 
of activity are, the possibility of a fall in prices seems real. 
The Dubai government appears fully cognizant of the risks of a 
property crash and has taken steps to decrease speculation. 
Indeed, a controlled slide in property prices and rents could 
prove to be better for business than escalating prices have 
been. Looking at the larger picture, allowing expatriates to buy 
homes will slow down the repatriation of Dubai-created wealth, 
enhance Dubai\'s economic base, and create more \"buy in\" from 
Dubai\'s expatriates.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: IR, PREL 
SUBJECT: IRAN\'S EXPANDING JUDICIARY DRAWS MAJLIS FIRE 
 
 
1. (U) Sensitive But Unclassified - Protect Accordingly 
 
2. (SBU) SUMMARY: In late December 2004 the Majlis Judicial And 
Legal Committee approved a bill to investigate the Iranian 
Judiciary, forwarding it to the Majlis General Session for 
consideration.  Also in late December 2004 a related ongoing 
dispute between the Judiciary\'s Counter-Intelligence branch and 
members of the Majlis became public.  The Majlis claimed that 
the Judiciary had interfered with an Experts Assembly 
investigation of the Judiciary, whereas the Judiciary claimed 
that the investigation itself was illegal and that those 
carrying out the Experts Assembly investigating team were 
themselves criminals involved in fraud and other illegal 
activities. 
 
3. (SBU) SUMMARY (CONT): This rare Majlis-Judiciary public 
confrontation occurs as the Judiciary is seeking to vastly 
increase its intelligence and security capabilities.  Some 
insiders interpret the Majlis\'s attempted crackdown on the 
Judiciary as an effort by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
to suppress the Judiciary\'s drive for greater power and 
independence.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MAJLIS SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE JUDICIARY 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) According to the Majlis news service, on October 31, 2004 
Majlis representative Hassan Kamran, member of National Security 
and Foreign Policy Committee, said that approximately 100 
representatives had signed a bill to investigate the Iranian 
Judiciary.  On December 22 Iranian press reported that the 
Judicial and Legal Committee (dominated by hard-line 
conservatives) had approved the investigation request, with the 
bill subsequently to be voted on by the Majlis as a whole. 
 
5. (U) The bill\'s proposed investigative mandate was extensive, 
with Committee member Mahmoud Dehqani telling press that the 
focus would be on: 
 
- the Judiciary\'s success in confronting economic corruption; 
 
- reports of judges and judicial authorities taking personal 
advantage of their official position, and the quality of 
supervision on financial and ethical issues for the Justice 
Department\'s personnel and judges; 
 
- the Judiciary\'s approach to social disorder; 
 
- subordinate Judiciary organizations, such as the Deeds and 
Properties Registration Organization, the Judiciary Information 
Security (CI) Department, the State General Inspection 
Organization, and the Prisons Organization; 
 
- the Judiciary\'s performance in respecting those with business 
before it, and the conduct of judges and judicial authorities; 
 
- disbursal of Judicial funds allocated to it under the Third 
Development Plan; 
 
- the quality of executing the leader\'s orders with regard to 
the Judiciary; 
 
- the function of Articles 49 and 142 of the Constitution, which 
authorize the government to confiscate all illegally acquired 
wealth (49) and which authorize the head of the Judiciary to 
investigate the assets of key government personnel before and 
after their government service, to ensure their wealth \"has not 
increased in a fashion contrary to law, (142).\" 
 
JUDICIARY SAYS HANDS-OFF 
------------------------ 
 
6. (U) In response to the proposed bill, Judiciary spokesman 
Jamal Karimi Rad told press that any broad Majlis investigation 
of the Judiciary would be unconstitutional, since the Majlis was 
by law allowed to investigate only the Judiciary\'s financial 
matters.  Despite Karimi Rad\'s contention, one of the most vocal 
proponents of the Majlis investigation, Tabriz Representative 
Eshrat Shayeq (a hard- line conservative), told press that the 
Majlis investigation was consonant with its supervisory mandate, 
and that it was going to investigate the general performance of 
the Judiciary, not any specific decrees or rulings. 
 
EXPERTS ASSEMBLY INVESTIGATION? 
------------------------------- 
7. (U) Judiciary-Majlis relations took a new twist in late 
December 2004, when Iranian press broke a story that Iran\'s 
Experts Assembly (EA -the 70 member clerical body charged with 
selecting and overseeing the Supreme Leader) was investigating 
the Judiciary, in accordance with its constitutional authority 
to investigate the Leadership and its subordinate organizations. 
 On December 22, a conservative Iranian news site reported that 
the EA had authorized its representative from East Azerbaijan, 
Ayatollah Orumiyan, to investigate the Judiciary.  According to 
these initial reports, Orumiyan had formed a three-person 
investigating group led by his office head, Hossein Madhi (aka 
Mr. Hosseini, Haj Reza Hosseini).  The two other members of this 
EA investigating group were (the abovementioned) Majlis Tabriz 
representative Eshrat Shayeq and another individual belonging to 
Orumiyan\'s office, referred to as \'Sepehr.\' 
8. (U) According to initial press accounts, this EA 
investigating group focused on the Judiciary\'s \"Information 
Security department\" (\"Hefezat-e Ettela\'at,\" i.e. the 
Judiciary\'s Counter-Intelligence branch - CI).  According to 
initial press reports there were rumors that this EA 
investigating team exceeded its legal mandate, and armed with 
weapons, attempted to detain some of the Judicial CI officials. 
The resultant clash between this EA group and the Judiciary\'s CI 
led to \"Sepehr\'s\" death and Hossein Madhi\'s hospitalisation. 
 
JUDICIARY DENIES IT... 
---------------------- 
 
9. (U) In response to these initial reports, on December 29, 
Iranian press relayed the comments of both Judiciary spokesman 
Jamal Karimi Rad and Head of the Judiciary\'s Information 
Security (CI) Department Elyas Mahmoudi.  Both denied there was 
any EA investigation of the Judiciary, and also denied the death 
and injury of the putative investigating committee\'s members. 
Rather, Mahmoudi told press that the \"EA investigating 
committee\" was instead a band of criminals using \"forged 
decrees\" to commit illegal acts.  He claimed that the EA 
leadership had denied the authenticity of all decrees presented 
by this \"EA investigating group,\" saying that the group in no 
way represented it.  Mahmoudi said that Majlis representative 
Eshrat Shayeq seemed to have been in league with this illegal 
group.  He said she had abused her position as a member of the 
Majlis Article 90 Commission (charged with investigating 
citizens\' complaints) to issue Majlis decrees in support of this 
criminal group, these decrees also having been subsequently 
repudiated by the Article 90 Commission. 
 
...MAJLIS DENIES DENIAL 
----------------------- 
 
10. (U) Later on December 29 Iranian press carried the comments 
of Majlis representative Teymur Ali \'Asgari, Deputy Head of the 
Article 90 Commission, who denied Judiciary CI department 
Mahmoudi\'s denials.  \'Asgari claimed that an EA member 
(Ayatollah Orumiyan) had in fact authorized this three-person 
group to investigate the Judiciary, focusing on \"parallel 
intelligence structures\" within the Judiciary.  \'Asgari said the 
Judiciary\'s CI department had prevented this group\'s activities 
and detained two group members.  He confirmed that Tabriz 
representative Shayeq had been a group member, and denied 
Mahmoudi\'s charges of her involvement in illegal activities. 
\'Asgari said that the Article 90 Commission had formed a 
committee to investigate what had happened between the 
Judiciary\'s CI department and the EA investigating group.  More 
generally, he added that most complaints received by the Article 
90 Commission involved the Judiciary. 
 
...JUDICIARY PROVIDES DETAILS 
 ---------------------------- 
 
11. (U) The next development came on January 1, 2005, when a 
Deputy in the Judiciary\'s CI department, Judge Vahed Sharifi, 
gave a press conference about the \"EA Investigating Group\" case. 
 Sharifi, who was the case\'s examining magistrate, said that a 
case against this group had been opened based on complaints from 
numerous entities and individuals.  All of the plaintiffs had 
claimed that the group\'s head \"Hosseini\" had presented himself 
as the \"Office Head and Supreme Security and Political Advisor\" 
to EA member Ayatollah Orumiyan.  According to Sharifi, Hosseini 
had abused his position within Ayatollah Orumiyan\'s office to 
intervene in open judicial cases on behalf of one of the 
parties.  He also said numerous private plaintiffs had claimed 
that Hosseini\'s group had forced them to sign contracts ceding 
valuable lands in Tabriz and elsewhere.  Two plaintiffs, the 
Kish Island Free Trade Organization and the Kish Island Free 
Trade Zone Law Enforcement Forces Commander, alleged that 
Hosseini\'s group had sought to intercede in an open legal case 
on behalf of a former leaseholder of the Shayan Hotel, even 
flying down an armed delegation to Kish Island to force evacuate 
the hotel in favor of this former leaseholder. 
 
12. (U) In one bizarre case cited by Sharifi, at one point 
Hosseini had been hospitalized in Tehran\'s Mehr Hospital and had 
became enamored of an attending nurse.  Despite having four 
wives already, he proposed to her.  When she repeatedly refused, 
he used threats to press his case, and upon release got a court 
warrant for her detention after having submitted false 
information about her.  Armed with this warrant, he and some 
others went to the hospital, \"put a sack over her head,\" and 
took her to an illegal detention center in Tehran, where, 
according to charges, he harassed and molested her.  According 
to Sharifi, Majlis representative Eshrat Shayeq was present 
during the whole of this nurse\'s illegal incarceration and 
interrogation. 
 
13. (U) Sharifi also charged that Shayeq had written letters on 
official Majlis stationary empowering Hosseini on behalf of the 
Article 90 Commission and appointing him \"Supreme Security and 
Political Advisor\" for the Commission, which he subsequently 
used for his illegal activities.  Sharifi also said that over 
400 decrees signed by Ayatollah Orumiyan were seized when 
Hosseini was arrested, many of these decrees seeking to 
influence the courts on behalf of one of the involved parties. 
Also seized was a letter issued by Orumiyan authorizing Hossein 
to carry spray gas, handcuffs and walkie-talkie, and a revolver. 
 
14. (U) Sharifi told press that based on Judiciary and 
Intelligence Ministry investigations, ten members of the 
Hosseini gang had been arrested.  Charges against them include 
\"impersonating a government official, fraud, involvement in 
illegal detention, illegal sales of government property, and 
interference in judicial affairs.\"  Sharifi added that according 
to the Intelligence Ministry, Hosseini had a criminal record and 
had previously been detained for misrepresenting himself as a 
government official.  Sharifi said all the defendants had been 
freed on bail.  Concerning Majlis representative Shayeq and EA 
member Ayatollah Orumiyan, Sharifi said the former\'s 
Parliamentary Immunity had prevented her from being arrested 
heretofore, and that the file on Orumiyan would be sent to the 
Special Clerical Court. 
 
15. (U) According to another January 1, 2005 press account, 
Ayatollah Orumiyan was a member of the EA\'s standing 
Investigative Commission, and as such had opened an 
investigation of the Judiciary in approximately June 2003, 
creating this three-member investigating team.  In August 2004, 
when some of the team\'s findings came to the attention of 
officials in the Judiciary and the EA, it encountered increased 
opposition from the Judiciary\'s CI.  On August 22, 2004, the 
Judiciary\'s CI arrested 17 people related to this EA 
investigating team, to include team leader Hosseini.  According 
to this account Hosseini was detained for 47 days \"in harsh 
conditions\", and released on bail on October 7, 2004.  He 
subsequently complained to the Article 90 commission.  This 
article said that EA investigating team member \"Sepehr,\" who was 
originally reported to have died in Judiciary detention, had in 
fact died of a heart attack upon hearing of his imminent arrest 
on August 25.  This news account relayed the rumor that 
\"Hosseini\" was one of those purged in 1998 from the Intelligence 
Ministry due to the \"Serial Killings,\" controversy, after which 
he started working in Orumiyan\'s office. 
 
AE\'S AYATOLLAH ORUMIYAN - \"MISTAKES WERE MADE\" 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
16. (U) On January 1, 2005, Iranian press carried a letter from 
EA member Ayatollah Orumiyan to the Judiciary CI head Alyas 
Mahmoudi.  Saying that both he and Mahmoudi were \"working to 
defend the Revolution, protect the martyrs\' blood and carry out 
our duties to the exalted Leader,\" he chastised Judiciary 
investigating magistrate Sharifi for commenting publicly on an 
investigation in progress.  In this letter and in a separate 
statement released to press, Orumiyan said his office staff 
included official representatives of Iran\'s intelligence and 
security organizations, to include the Judiciary\'s CI 
department, and that these representatives were involved in and 
fully apprised of the office\'s activities, as was Judiciary CI 
head Mahmoudi himself.  Due to their official positions, 
Orumiyan had fully trusted these security and intelligence 
individuals within his office.  He said that he had in fact 
authorized an investigation into the Judiciary, but claimed to 
have been unaware of any violations by his office director, whom 
he fired as soon as he became aware of alleged violations. 
17. (U) On January 5, 2005, Iranian press printed a letter from 
Majlis representative Eshrat Shayeq to Judiciary Head Ayatollah 
Shahroudi, denying the charges against her and asking for him to 
investigate Judiciary investigating magistrate Sharifi for 
commenting so extensively to press on an open case.  She also 
told Iranian press that she knew that she would be \'targeted\' by 
the Judiciary once she began calls for its investigation, and 
that the subsequent actions against her by the Judiciary had 
confirmed her previous concerns.  She also cited her calling for 
an enquiry into the death in detention of Iran-Iraq water 
veteran Rajabi Sani, who was allegedly tortured and killed at 
the hands of judiciary officials, as another reason for judicial 
animus against her. 
 
18. (U) The most recent development in this case occurred on 
January 7, 2005, when Iranian press carried a statement by the 
main defendant \"Hosseini,\" in which he claimed that he didn\'t 
have four wives, had never violated the law nor been found 
guilty of any crime, and had not fired from his job (rather, he 
quit).  He claimed that whatever he had done was legal, and in 
accordance with the responsibilities entrusted to him.  He 
concluded by saying he was a war veteran with 37 pieces of 
shrapnel in his body, who each day has to take more than 50 
pills, seven sprays, and three syrups. 
 
 IRGC TRYING TO SLAP DOWN JUDICIARY? 
------------------------------------ 
 
19. (U) These problems for the Judiciary come amidst its efforts 
to vastly increase its investigative and prosecutorial powers. 
In December 2004 Iranian press also reported on the Judiciary\'s 
creation of provincial civil defense militia entitled \"Units for 
Protecting Society (\"Sazeman-e Hefazat-e Ejtema\'i\").  These 
units, first proposed by Judiciary Head Ayatollah Shahroudi in 
January 2004, were to be entrusted with \" crime-fighting, 
intelligence-gathering and providing religious guidance,\" in 
accordance with the Article 8 of the Constitution and the 
Islamic precept of \"enjoining the good and forbidding the evil 
(\"Amr be Ma\'ruf va nahi az monkar\"). 
 
20. (U) Many Majlis members have spoken up against these 
provincial units, some of which have already been stood up. 
They note that their mission replicates that of the Basij, and 
that these units have been created without any authorizing 
Majlis legislation.  Basij Commander Brigader General Seyed 
Mohammd Hejazi was quoted in press as saying that this \"rival 
militia\" would cause many problems, and that \"this scheme lacks 
expertise and professional groundwork.\" 
 
21. (U) Iranian Press in December also reported the Judiciary\'s 
plans to create its own \"Judicial Police Organization\" 
(\"Sazeman-e Zabetayn-e Qohveh-e Qaza\"), responsible for 
uncovering and investigating crime, a function currently largely 
carried out by the Basij, Intelligence Ministry and Law 
Enforcement Forces.  Analysts of the Iranian scene cite these 
two new proposed forces as further evidence of the 
transformation over recent years of Iran\'s Judiciary\'s into one 
of the main intelligence-security organs within Iran, operating 
independently of the Intelligence Ministry. 
 
22. (SBU) In early January 2005 Poloff met with \"Reza,\" one of 
Iran\'s leading private sector businessmen, with extensive 
connections among Iran\'s leadership. \"Reza\" told Poloff that the 
Majlis investigation into the Judiciary was being executed at 
the behest of the IRGC, who had great power within the Majlis 
due to the number of IRGC-sponsored and affiliated 
representatives.  The IRGC was using this influence to curtail 
and control the Judiciary\'s growing power, which it saw as a 
threat to itself and the Basji.  \"Reza\" also affirmed that EA\'s 
Ayatollah Orumiyan and his office head Hosseini had abused their 
positions and had been involved in extensive illegal activities 
for commercial gain, something he said \"happened all the time\" 
at this level. 
 
23. (SBU) COMMENT:  It is unclear as to what actually happened 
between the Judiciary\'s CI department and the team authorized by 
the Assembly of Expert\'s Ayatollah Orumiyan to investigate it, 
and their respective culpabilities.  Regardless, the case is 
interesting insomuch as the internecine struggles within 
conservative ranks rarely break so openly into the press.  Some 
Iranian press analysts predict that any Majlis investigation on 
the Judiciary will be put off until after the June 2005 
Presidential elections, when the political situation is clearer. 
 Whatever the result, these reports of groups armed with both 
weapons and senior clerical authorization committing massive 
fraud, extortion and intervening in the judicial process give a 
rare detailed glimpse of the endemic high-level corruption 
within the Iranian government.

2. (U) From January 8-10, the UAE Ministry of Labor and Social 
Affairs (MoL) hosted a seminar in Dubai entitled \"The Role of 
the Labor Department in the Implementation of the International 
and Arab Labor Standards and Basic Principles and Rights at 
Work.\"  Organized in cooperation with the Arab Center for Labor 
Management and Employment in Tunisia, the seminar was attended 
by 30 MoL inspectors and legal affairs officers.  MoL U/S Dr. 
Khalid Al Khazraji opened the seminar by reading a keynote 
speech by Minister of Labor Dr. Ali Al Ka\'abi stressing the 
UAE\'s intention to adhere to and implement international 
conventions.  He noted that the UAE had ratified nine ILO 
conventions, including 6 of the 8 core labor conventions.  He 
stressed that \"ratification of international labor conventions 
obligates the country to observe them in national legislation 
and practice.  This puts a huge responsibility on labor 
officials to monitor the UAE\'s obligations in labor standards.\" 
 
 
3. (SBU) On January 11, Consul General and PolEconoff met with 
Al Khazraji to get a readout on the seminar.  Al Khazraji said 
the purpose of the seminar was to help the MoL participants 
understand how to apply, in the UAE context, the six ILO core 
conventions that the UAE had signed. Al Khazraji said other 
topics discussed included a comparison of UAE law to ILO 
standards, and a how-to session on writing reports for the ILO. 
 
4. (SBU) The four main presenters at the seminar were two 
experts from the Tunisian Arab Labor Center and two experts from 
the MoL. According to Al Khazraji, the 30 participants were 
mainly young up-and-comers at the MoL. For some it was their 
first exposure to the ILO conventions. Participants especially 
enjoyed the workshop session, when they divided into four 
groups, each of which analyzed how to apply a different ILO 
convention. 
 
5. (SBU) CG asked whether the seminar had dealt at all with the 
labor union law. Al Khazraji said the seminar had not dealt with 
that law, and that in fact that law had not been completely 
drafted yet. Would the new law allow foreign workers to join 
labor unions, CG asked?  Al Khazraji said the UAEG was still 
debating that issue. 
 
6. (SBU) Regarding the recently released statistic that 11,424 
labor complaints involving 16,424 laborers had been lodged with 
the MoL in 2004, Al Khazraji said \"the UAE is a vibrant and 
growing market -- this is to be expected.\"  He said 80 percent 
of the disputes were resolved at the MoL rather than going to 
court. Al Khazraji additionally claimed that workers themselves 
were partially to blame in many cases. \"They wait until after 
they haven\'t been paid for six or seven months before coming to 
us, rather than coming after two or three months,\" he said. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  UAEG officials have told us repeatedly that 
they understand the need to revise their labor law to bring it 
more in compliance with ILO standards.  The issue of allowing 
labor unions is a sensitive one here, but one that the UAEG 
understands must be dealt with as part of FTA negotiations with 
the U.S.  In the meantime, however, the Ministry of Labor 
continues its efforts to better enforce the existing law and to 
comply with the ILO conventions that the UAE is a member of.
